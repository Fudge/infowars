[00:00:00.623 --> 00:00:01.524]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:01.544 --> 00:00:05.766]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:06.386 --> 00:00:10.468]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:22.194]  A mother called in, talking about
[00:00:24.472 --> 00:00:32.657]  A Seward, Alaska lockdown of the town drill and a multi-day event at the school, kind of a death education brainwashing meeting.
[00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:43.383]  So, I just told my guys, I said, Google and print me all the articles you can find with just the keyword... What was the keyword?
[00:00:44.184 --> 00:00:45.064]  School drill.
[00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:49.907]  Children using trash cans as toilets.
[00:00:51.788 --> 00:00:52.709]  And they literally
[00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.692]  This is more than 20 articles they just printed in the last 30 minutes.
[00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:04.396]  Now, I want you guys to Google, Death Education Columbine 2020.
[00:01:05.516 --> 00:01:10.299]  This is in my film, Police Head to the Takeover.
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.102]  The mainstream news articles that they taught the kids how to get in coffins, how to hang themselves so they wouldn't do it.
[00:01:16.122 --> 00:01:18.704]  And of course, massive suicides exploded at the school.
[00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:22.816]  The whole thing was a federally run brainwashing camp.
[00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:23.417]  That's been proven.
[00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:24.257]  It was a test model.
[00:01:24.557 --> 00:01:25.917]  And they staged the shootings there, of course.
[00:01:25.957 --> 00:01:26.537]  That's on record.
[00:01:27.557 --> 00:01:28.178]  We've proven that.
[00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:30.658]  Oh, you didn't know about that?
[00:01:32.498 --> 00:01:37.099]  But regardless, I start mentioning how they don't feed the kids all day.
[00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.100]  They make them use the bathroom in trash cans.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.640]  They tell them that real terrorists are coming to kill them.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.361]  They tell the kids in many of these drills, some they
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.041]  Just ask for volunteers during the weekend.
[00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:50.641]  It's the drama department and that's reasonable.
[00:01:51.702 --> 00:01:56.063]  We want to be clear that I'm going to videotape some of the ones that are reasonable.
[00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:58.424]  They still are meant to create fear.
[00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:03.486]  They still are meant to train everybody to live in a police state and hate guns.
[00:02:04.686 --> 00:02:07.727]  And we're showing some of those right now, but those are at least with kids that volunteer.
[00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:13.849]  They have other ones all over the country where they go in unannounced showing the mindset of these people.
[00:02:15.404 --> 00:02:26.627]  So I said I would go over those, and I have some news here dealing with missing ampule, three missing ampules.
[00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:29.728]  Yeah, there's death education at Columbine High.
[00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:32.008]  Excellent, 1999, you found it.
[00:02:32.608 --> 00:02:33.269]  There's another one, 2002, 2000, no, 2000, 1991, 1992.
[00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:49.037]  With them in the coffins, even if they didn't want to be in the coffins, they would sit on top of them until they felt like they were suffocating, to quote, it's kind of like waterboarding, to show them what death is like.
[00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:54.963]  And then this is where they teach you that terrorists are coming and are going to kill you and guns are bad and the police state's good.
[00:02:55.623 --> 00:02:57.405]  And that's all this is for, a bunch of crap.
[00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:05.713]  And then I already showed you martial law drills where they practice taking over our cities, but I'm going to get to that coming up in the next segment.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.602]  But I kind of went wild here earlier.
[00:03:10.902 --> 00:03:24.672]  I'm trying to find my CNBC article dealing with the missing bioweapon.
[00:03:24.692 --> 00:03:27.494]  I mean, I can't keep track of this anymore.
[00:03:27.514 --> 00:03:30.636]  This is literally, I've probably got 200 articles today.
[00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:33.352]  Let's go ahead and get a call in here.
[00:03:33.392 --> 00:03:36.814]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jessica in Texas.
[00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:38.356]  Jessica, you're on the air.
[00:03:39.016 --> 00:03:39.676]  Hey, Alex.
[00:03:39.837 --> 00:03:44.080]  First of all, I wanted to say thank you for putting Chemtrails back on the top of the pile.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.964]  I met you a couple years ago and didn't really know much about it then, but have found a lot of information.
[00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:53.486]  Wanted to tell people to check out Carnicorn.com.
[00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:57.109]  That website's got a lot of information about within those things.
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.147]  And also was hoping you might indulge me in kind of a hardcore fantasy we all have about, you know, arresting the bankers.
[00:04:06.248 --> 00:04:10.493]  All the people creating all this tyranny here.
[00:04:10.673 --> 00:04:14.938]  And what you know, what is the legal process?
[00:04:14.998 --> 00:04:18.561]  I mean, can we do mass citizen arrest of all these treasonous people?
[00:04:18.942 --> 00:04:20.664]  Well, that's why they keep calling
[00:04:21.863 --> 00:04:24.204]  Standing up for your private property is now terrorism.
[00:04:24.604 --> 00:04:25.885]  Protesting is terrorism.
[00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:33.029]  Yes, I mean, the answer to it is taking our counties, our cities, our states back, saying, arrest, arrest, arrest, you're criminals, you're criminals.
[00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:37.691]  Pointing out that the elite is a fraudulent government.
[00:04:39.272 --> 00:04:41.614]  And, tell you what, stay there.
[00:04:41.674 --> 00:04:44.055]  We will all indulge our fantasies of arresting these people.
[00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:47.957]  The simplest, most direct way to beat them with one fell swoop.
[00:04:50.282 --> 00:04:52.123]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:04:52.243 --> 00:04:57.425]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:04:57.606 --> 00:04:58.946]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:07.390]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.333]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:05:13.493 --> 00:05:15.295]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:17.517]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:05:17.537 --> 00:05:21.881]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:24.203]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:05:24.283 --> 00:05:32.150]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:05:50.364 --> 00:05:55.608]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:05:56.406 --> 00:06:01.750]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.475]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:08.775 --> 00:06:10.596]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:10.736 --> 00:06:13.138]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:06:13.218 --> 00:06:24.106]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:26.394 --> 00:06:27.655]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:29.456]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:36.240]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:47.848]  The people strike back.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.504]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:06:54.784 --> 00:07:03.071]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:06.654]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:07:06.934 --> 00:07:09.876]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:07:10.156 --> 00:07:12.298]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[00:07:12.658 --> 00:07:15.380]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.

[00:07:41.605 --> 00:07:43.026]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.486]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:00.966 --> 00:08:03.388]  In 52 minutes, we're scheduled to have Alan Cumms on for 30.
[00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:07.432]  So, I'm just gonna give each caller one minute.
[00:08:08.072 --> 00:08:15.599]  Then I gotta get into all this other important news that I have here in front of me.
[00:08:19.362 --> 00:08:20.323]  And then we will, uh...
[00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:29.030]  Of course, get into what's happening in the schools, the re-education camps, literally, where they brainwash and terrorize children for mind control.
[00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:36.491]  Of course, the average cop doesn't realize they're part of a literal re-invention of Soviet mind control.
[00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:37.532]  Literally.
[00:08:37.692 --> 00:08:42.132]  So let's go ahead and go back to Jessica in Texas.
[00:08:42.173 --> 00:08:42.893]  Go ahead and finish up.
[00:08:43.953 --> 00:08:48.934]  Well, I was going to say, we have our own trees in this little builder burger right here in this city.
[00:08:49.274 --> 00:08:50.494]  I mean, you know, Rick Perry.
[00:08:51.144 --> 00:08:53.145]  What's he still doing sitting up there on his seat?
[00:08:53.906 --> 00:08:59.609]  Well, he's feeling the heat, so he's saying, I'm a patriot, I'm against the new world war, I'm against federal tyranny.
[00:08:59.629 --> 00:09:04.192]  Okay, but we have actual proof that he has committed treason, why is he not in jail right now?
[00:09:05.292 --> 00:09:08.054]  Because the state police and everybody else are under his control.
[00:09:09.195 --> 00:09:11.736]  Well, then I guess, citizen's arrest?
[00:09:11.876 --> 00:09:19.501]  I mean... I appreciate your call, let me... The question really is, if the system is set up to prevent them
[00:09:20.569 --> 00:09:25.944]  Or prevent us from getting to them and putting them on trial, then really, seriously, what are we going to do?
[00:09:27.244 --> 00:09:29.744]  Well, they've overthrown our system, and we've got to get it back.
[00:09:30.004 --> 00:09:31.065]  Let me try to break this down.
[00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:46.107]  If enough people are just awake to their crimes and don't go along with it, and just start saying criminal, criminal everywhere they go, instead of groveling to authority in badges and uniforms and, you know, segments of authority, then we're already on our way to discrediting them and their system falling.
[00:09:46.407 --> 00:09:50.788]  That's why they're taking the velvet glove off the iron fist and coming in aggressively now.
[00:09:52.868 --> 00:09:53.849]  So that's one issue.
[00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:55.589]  That's all I pretty much had to say.
[00:09:55.609 --> 00:09:56.429]  Thank you for your show.
[00:09:57.179 --> 00:09:58.160]  Thank you so much.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.061]  We're going to let you go.
[00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:03.626]  Thank you, Jessica, from Texas.
[00:10:05.448 --> 00:10:13.396]  Now, talking about fantasy, what's the quickest way to get the bankers arrested?
[00:10:14.758 --> 00:10:17.601]  You have a couple dozen grand juries indict.
[00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:27.660]  Start inditing or calling for indictments of Geithner and Summers and everybody who engineered the crisis we're in and did all this illegal stuff.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.921]  They can't kill all the grand juries.
[00:10:30.402 --> 00:10:31.822]  It would become obvious if they did.
[00:10:32.303 --> 00:10:35.925]  They'd probably still try it and that would really wake folks up.
[00:10:36.785 --> 00:10:41.088]  See, as more people stand up and say no, others start standing up and saying no.
[00:10:42.489 --> 00:10:50.395]  That's why when Eliot Spitzer wrote one article saying it was a criminal fraud what was going on as governor, he had skeletons in his closet.
[00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:55.018]  He was visiting a hooker and they burned him with it and it turned out he was under FBI surveillance the whole time.
[00:10:55.358 --> 00:11:03.544]  Just like every member of Congress is under NSA surveillance 24-7 and I've told you that for years and it's now public and they admit they do it without warrants.
[00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:13.797]  You wonder why Congress is told by the presidency, you run nothing, and they say, yes sir, boss, when they are equal to the president or above the president in the structure of power?
[00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:20.582]  Because they're spying on them and they got all the dirt or they'll make dirt up.
[00:11:21.383 --> 00:11:24.446]  I mean, they blow up congressman's planes and senators' planes all the time.
[00:11:24.886 --> 00:11:28.249]  I mean, these people are in power because they are murderers.
[00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:30.767]  They're criminals!
[00:11:31.849 --> 00:11:33.612]  And a lot of Americans said, oh, so what?
[00:11:33.652 --> 00:11:35.054]  That's how America gets stuff done.
[00:11:35.274 --> 00:11:36.657]  But now they're going to take your pension funds.
[00:11:36.977 --> 00:11:38.660]  Now they're going to brainwash your kids against you.
[00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:40.263]  See, they want it all.
[00:11:44.582 --> 00:12:00.927]  So you would have a dozen or so grand juries move for indictments on different issues and it would just start a snowball just like it is now with all these big globalists like Madoff and others caught stealing tens of billions of dollars and being at the highest echelons.
[00:12:00.987 --> 00:12:02.607]  That shows people these are crooks.
[00:12:03.027 --> 00:12:04.288]  We're getting to that point.
[00:12:05.788 --> 00:12:08.069]  Hell, 98% of Americans don't like the bankers.
[00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:10.149]  See, we are the majority.
[00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:11.950]  They got a tiger by the tail.
[00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:19.559]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Texas who disagrees.
[00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:20.279]  Go ahead, Brian.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.740]  Hi, Alex.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.300]  How's it going?
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:41.864]  And listen, what I disagree about was nothing you talked about today, but I got a little bit, I don't know, not offended because this is such an important stuff, but I'm a former, I guess, Republican right-winger who, you know, just didn't believe, thought this stuff was too dastardly to believe.
[00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:44.124]  And yesterday you were going on and on about
[00:12:44.608 --> 00:12:45.708]  We want to be scammed.
[00:12:45.748 --> 00:12:46.649]  We love it.
[00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:47.869]  We're stupid.
[00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:50.570]  Look, dude, that's just not it.
[00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.950]  People don't know.
[00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:54.331]  I didn't know this stuff.
[00:12:54.351 --> 00:12:55.432]  I listened to you.
[00:12:55.452 --> 00:12:57.692]  I researched it myself.
[00:12:57.772 --> 00:12:59.153]  I didn't just swallow what you said.
[00:12:59.773 --> 00:13:01.074]  I'm shocked and I believe it.
[00:13:02.274 --> 00:13:06.375]  I think what's happening, Alex, is there's fixing to be a big cabal.
[00:13:06.555 --> 00:13:09.796]  I used to be a big Rush fan until I started listening to you.
[00:13:09.817 --> 00:13:12.297]  Dude, he is getting closer and closer.
[00:13:12.337 --> 00:13:14.158]  He's dancing around everything you're saying.
[00:13:15.066 --> 00:13:20.730]  And I don't know, but I think if these two forces come together, you need to claim credit.
[00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:27.315]  And you can become, I mean, bigger than everybody.
[00:13:27.355 --> 00:13:33.719]  But I wouldn't go and start throwing rocks at everybody who can't get their arms around this.
[00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:42.686]  I understand, it's just that when I see that every major vaccine is killing people left and right, and killing people I know,
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.904]  And, you know, I'm not talking about you.
[00:13:48.004 --> 00:13:57.034]  I'm talking about the people that still go out and take the vaccines, that still think the Federal Reserve is governmental, that still think the government's legitimate.
[00:13:57.054 --> 00:13:58.376]  I'm not talking about you.
[00:13:58.416 --> 00:14:02.801]  And I, listen, the reason this radio show is popular is because I'm, this is real.
[00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:04.123]  This isn't entertainment.
[00:14:04.163 --> 00:14:05.004]  This isn't a shtick.
[00:14:05.464 --> 00:14:07.546]  This is what... I mean, they see me here at the office.
[00:14:08.027 --> 00:14:08.968]  They know I'm freaked out.
[00:14:09.068 --> 00:14:09.809]  I mean, I mean this.
[00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:12.272]  I'm like, get me more documents, get me more proof.
[00:14:12.292 --> 00:14:13.092]  We've got to fight them!
[00:14:13.112 --> 00:14:16.476]  We've got to... I've got to control myself to just go home.
[00:14:16.536 --> 00:14:24.024]  Even though I love my family and my children and want to spend time with them, they have no future if I don't stay down here in the boiler room and get these pipes fixed.
[00:14:24.745 --> 00:14:27.007]  And man, it shakes me up.
[00:14:27.147 --> 00:14:35.334]  It freaks me out to study Soviet brainwashing techniques in schools and then to see exactly that in the United States.
[00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:37.296]  I'm freaked out, man!
[00:14:37.736 --> 00:14:42.160]  And I don't know how everybody else doesn't see it and isn't freaked out.
[00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:44.282]  And as for Rush Limbaugh,
[00:14:46.878 --> 00:14:51.186]  Rush has been consistently the way he is, so I don't really attack him like I do a Glenn Beck.
[00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:54.411]  Glenn Beck is an operative, and I'll tell you right now, I can tell he is and I know what I'm talking about.
[00:14:55.242 --> 00:14:57.324]  Limbaugh, I know, is having to dance around this.
[00:14:57.644 --> 00:15:01.347]  Hillary Clinton came out yesterday and said she loves Ron Paul.
[00:15:01.908 --> 00:15:03.349]  And they introduced her on Hardball.
[00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:04.910]  I saw the intro to it.
[00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.171]  We have a clip from later in the show.
[00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:10.475]  As, oh yeah, she used to be a very Goldwater girl.
[00:15:11.375 --> 00:15:15.459]  And suddenly Fox and CNN love Ron Paul and MSNBC does.
[00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:18.341]  Because they know, sir, we are the majority now.
[00:15:19.202 --> 00:15:20.743]  We just don't know we're the majority.
[00:15:20.983 --> 00:15:23.846]  So they're trying to... It's like...
[00:15:24.767 --> 00:15:25.227]  A U.S.
[00:15:25.287 --> 00:15:29.009]  tank attacking the Battle of the Bulge painted itself gray so the Germans don't shoot at it.
[00:15:29.789 --> 00:15:39.773]  They have taken the colorations... There's lots of beetles and things that have the colorations of poison beetles, but they're not really poisonous.
[00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:42.874]  They're the false poison beetle, so that birds don't eat it.
[00:15:43.314 --> 00:15:48.516]  And so, you've got the real poison beetle to the New World Order, myself, Ron Paul, the real movement,
[00:15:49.446 --> 00:15:52.248]  So you've got them trying to look like the false poison beetle.
[00:15:52.789 --> 00:15:53.369]  You understand?
[00:15:53.389 --> 00:16:02.037]  And they're doing that because Rush Limbaugh has said for decades there's no world government, no new world order, there's not a banking cabal, and now it's all being announced.
[00:16:02.077 --> 00:16:02.497]  So great!
[00:16:02.797 --> 00:16:03.838]  Let Rush come along.
[00:16:04.018 --> 00:16:04.959]  I know he's come along.
[00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:08.582]  But he still reinforces it's left versus right.
[00:16:09.443 --> 00:16:11.925]  And so if you took that personally, sir, I wasn't talking about you.
[00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:14.147]  I was once ignorant to all of this as well.
[00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:15.488]  I'm just telling you,
[00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.171]  Maybe the stress gets to me.
[00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:20.913]  I mean, it does.
[00:16:21.033 --> 00:16:22.834]  And I get very, very aggressive.
[00:16:22.874 --> 00:16:23.315]  Anything else?
[00:16:24.156 --> 00:16:24.716]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:25.216 --> 00:16:41.191]  Let me tell you my fear and what I see happening, Alex, is I see some of this resistance that is almost 100% attributable to you and your circle being absorbed, like you talked about, and that this guy Obama overreaches and the storm dissipates.
[00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:44.994]  But what happens then is you are really in the shadows at that point.
[00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:50.674]  And the war continues, and you become very vulnerable when they are not about to take over.
[00:16:50.954 --> 00:16:55.218]  It's when they recede and start to regroup is when your life is in danger.
[00:16:56.238 --> 00:17:05.926]  Well, they're always on the move, and I'm so visible that they're more likely to keep trying to destroy me in the media, and I'm just committed.
[00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:10.229]  At this point, one way or the other, I'm just doing what I'm doing, but I appreciate your call.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.260]  Growing up, I never knew I'd be in this position.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.921]  And I never imagined, I was just like you, I never imagined that they were doing stuff like this.
[00:17:20.801 --> 00:17:23.562]  I mean, I don't blame people who can't wake up to this.
[00:17:24.262 --> 00:17:31.643]  But at this point, it's so obvious, I've still got major newspapers attacking me, saying none of this exists.
[00:17:33.224 --> 00:17:40.525]  I mean, they'll, ha ha, he says there's a new world order run by banks, and I've got literally six articles in my stack, mainstream news today, announcing it.
[00:17:44.245 --> 00:17:46.046]  And Obama's got the public conned.
[00:17:47.147 --> 00:17:52.270]  He's got like half the public still conned going, oh I think things are getting better under Obama, oh yeah.
[00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.771]  Meanwhile he knows he's destroyed them financially.
[00:17:55.512 --> 00:17:57.053]  Let's talk to another caller here.
[00:17:57.393 --> 00:17:59.694]  Let's go to Revo76, you're on the air.
[00:17:59.714 --> 00:18:01.735]  Mr. Jones!
[00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:02.656]  Hey!
[00:18:03.356 --> 00:18:04.177]  How are you sir?
[00:18:05.143 --> 00:18:07.344]  Thank you very much for the Obama Deception.
[00:18:07.624 --> 00:18:10.684]  It didn't wake me up, but it was a beautifully well done DVD.
[00:18:10.804 --> 00:18:11.224]  Beautiful.
[00:18:11.244 --> 00:18:12.425]  I have it on hard copy.
[00:18:12.465 --> 00:18:12.905]  Beautiful.
[00:18:13.545 --> 00:18:15.065]  The point is, you were already awake.
[00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:16.105]  We gotta wake others up.
[00:18:17.386 --> 00:18:17.806]  Of course.
[00:18:17.886 --> 00:18:21.206]  I mean, I'm arguing with people on MySpace about 9-11 still.
[00:18:21.346 --> 00:18:22.467]  I mean, I can't believe it.
[00:18:22.487 --> 00:18:24.087]  These are Bush supporters.
[00:18:24.847 --> 00:18:25.767]  Reagan supporters.
[00:18:25.827 --> 00:18:27.568]  I mean, Reagan was a puppet.
[00:18:27.588 --> 00:18:28.368]  They're all puppets.
[00:18:28.588 --> 00:18:33.289]  I mean, even on the Obama Deception, Kennedy was the last real president we had.
[00:18:33.866 --> 00:18:35.067]  I don't know what's wrong with people.
[00:18:35.087 --> 00:18:37.048]  They're not that they're sleeping.
[00:18:37.088 --> 00:18:38.149]  They're just brainwashed.
[00:18:38.169 --> 00:18:39.069]  They're morons.
[00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.952]  I mean, I, jeez, I mean, I was born in a police state, New York City.
[00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:44.153]  Grew up in Brooklyn.
[00:18:44.773 --> 00:18:46.374]  Okay, I'm down in North Carolina now.
[00:18:46.434 --> 00:18:47.075]  Beautiful.
[00:18:47.175 --> 00:18:48.236]  I can have my guns.
[00:18:48.316 --> 00:18:49.196]  I can have my freedom.
[00:18:49.216 --> 00:18:50.317]  I can grow up in my gardens.
[00:18:50.917 --> 00:18:51.558]  It's beautiful.
[00:18:52.178 --> 00:18:53.419]  Even the air is fresh.
[00:18:53.479 --> 00:18:56.701]  I mean, I do see occasional chemtrails, of course, and I do believe that.
[00:18:57.382 --> 00:18:59.143]  Everything you said is documented.
[00:18:59.163 --> 00:19:02.525]  I spoke to you last April about, what do you call,
[00:19:03.283 --> 00:19:14.545]  I've been awake to all this crap to a degree, but once I listen to you, I've listened to you almost every day, your show, every day for two years.
[00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:16.846]  Everything you say, I can document.
[00:19:17.226 --> 00:19:18.466]  I can find it myself.
[00:19:18.926 --> 00:19:19.846]  It's not BS.
[00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:21.247]  It's totally true.
[00:19:21.267 --> 00:19:23.087]  That's all I know what's wrong with people.
[00:19:23.227 --> 00:19:28.408]  I mean, they've just got to get out of their little brainwashed syndrome, where there's sodium fluoride, brainwashed syndrome.
[00:19:28.448 --> 00:19:29.728]  Well, it's all of that.
[00:19:29.748 --> 00:19:31.889]  The biggest thing, my friend, is they don't respect
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:33.680]  Revo 76.
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.201]  They don't respect themselves.
[00:19:36.841 --> 00:19:37.361]  God bless you.
[00:19:37.381 --> 00:19:37.961]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:42.883]  I'm going to wait on calls for a few minutes now, because I got to get started with all of this news.
[00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:44.423]  We'll hit Army.
[00:19:44.863 --> 00:19:47.824]  Three vials of virus samples missing from Maryland facility.
[00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:49.825]  We'll tell you about what virus when we get back.
[00:19:50.385 --> 00:19:50.725]  Good day.
[00:19:50.905 --> 00:19:52.386]  Jim Newcomer for Modest Resources.
[00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:52.806]  April 23rd, 2009.
[00:19:52.906 --> 00:19:53.927]  Coal opened this morning at $8.9290.
[00:19:53.967 --> 00:19:57.849]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.1892, $4.5946 for a half-ounce, and $2.2973 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:19:57.889 --> 00:19:58.169]  That's $9.1892, $4.5946, and $2.2973.
[00:20:08.474 --> 00:20:12.097]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:20:12.157 --> 00:20:15.200]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:24.447]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[00:20:24.767 --> 00:20:30.092]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:20:30.572 --> 00:20:32.894]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[00:20:32.914 --> 00:20:35.377]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.419]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:39.361]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:20:39.441 --> 00:20:39.741]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:40.902]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:40.962 --> 00:20:42.864]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:20:53.539 --> 00:20:55.663]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:20:56.164 --> 00:21:03.176]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:03.749 --> 00:21:09.935]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:10.315 --> 00:21:12.177]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:12.297 --> 00:21:14.719]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:25.750]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.662]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:28.042 --> 00:21:29.423]  It's about a one world government.
[00:21:29.904 --> 00:21:36.231]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:22:49.827 --> 00:22:52.149]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[00:22:52.309 --> 00:22:56.013]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[00:22:56.113 --> 00:22:58.756]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:22:58.916 --> 00:23:06.143]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[00:23:06.263 --> 00:23:06.884]  We're good to go.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.721]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:31.863]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.

[00:23:37.705 --> 00:23:41.446]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:23:42.166 --> 00:23:44.647]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[00:23:44.807 --> 00:23:45.247]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:23:52.495 --> 00:24:00.178]  Okay, I'm going to try to encapsulate this key information as succinctly as I can.
[00:24:00.258 --> 00:24:04.859]  I will tell you in the next segment what got me on that earlier rant last hour.
[00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:16.963]  The caller, Barbara, who was calling in from Seward, Alaska, where they're going to lock the whole town down for a martial law drill.
[00:24:17.003 --> 00:24:19.324]  I keep getting emails and calls about this, but no proof.
[00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:31.354]  Rob Doo said he just got an email of a mainstream news article confirming it, and right as that came in, the facts came in from Barbara with the Homeland Security card that was given to her by Homeland Security.
[00:24:31.894 --> 00:24:41.742]  They are doing a martial law lockdown drill, and I have the Director of the Sector Network Management, Bob Dee.
[00:24:41.802 --> 00:24:43.544]  I'm not going to give his full name out yet.
[00:24:44.264 --> 00:24:45.705]  We may just call this guy on air.
[00:24:46.586 --> 00:24:46.846]  U.S.
[00:24:46.866 --> 00:24:48.327]  Department of Homeland Security.
[00:24:49.989 --> 00:24:56.310]  601 Street, 12th Street, TSA-28, Arlington, Virginia, 22202.
[00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.291]  Got his cell, got his fax.
[00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:04.031]  This just came in from Barbara, who sent us stuff before, years ago, I remember her.
[00:25:09.172 --> 00:25:15.914]  So she went and asked Homeland Security and the town, this guy's up there for Virginia, for a lockdown of the town, to coincide with drills at the schools.
[00:25:16.274 --> 00:25:18.574]  Now I'm going to go over these drills for you in a moment.
[00:25:20.748 --> 00:25:21.488]  That's coming up.
[00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:24.350]  Now, this is from CNN.
[00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.092]  If you read this alone, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:25:27.992 --> 00:25:36.998]  But you combine this with all the other intel we've got, you project the lines, connect the dots, it gets very, very serious.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:48.525]  Now, CNN, Army, three vials of virus samples missing from Maryland facility.
[00:25:49.918 --> 00:25:57.544]  CNN, missing vials of a potentially dangerous virus have prompted an Army investigation into the disappearance from a lab in Maryland.
[00:25:58.325 --> 00:26:07.052]  The Army's Criminal Investigation Command agents have been visiting Fort Detrick, Maryland, to investigate the disappearance of the vials.
[00:26:07.633 --> 00:26:13.518]  Christopher Gray, spokesman for the command, said the latest investigation has found no evidence of criminal activity.
[00:26:13.998 --> 00:26:18.462]  The vials contain samples of Venezuelan equine encephalitis.
[00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:23.989]  A virus that sickens horses and can be spread to humans by mosquitoes.
[00:26:24.209 --> 00:26:30.150]  In 97% of cases, humans with the virus suffer flu-like symptoms, but can cause death.
[00:26:31.811 --> 00:26:32.491]  In some cases.
[00:26:33.331 --> 00:26:34.291]  It's just one out of a hundred.
[00:26:34.652 --> 00:26:47.935]  According to Corrie Vanderlinden, a spokeswoman for the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, there is an effective vaccine for the disease and there hasn't been an outbreak in the United States since 71.
[00:26:50.882 --> 00:26:56.807]  The vials had been in the Research Institute's facility at Fort Detrick, home of the Army's top biological research facility, for more than a decade.
[00:26:58.308 --> 00:27:10.259]  The three missing vials were among thousands of vials that were under the control of senior scientists who retired in 2004 when another Fort Detrick scientist recently inventoried the retired scientist's biological samples.
[00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:12.000]  He discovered that the vials were missing.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.041]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:27:13.462 --> 00:27:14.603]  Why is this so important?
[00:27:16.494 --> 00:27:24.937]  They want to build, and have finished a bunch of them, 36 level 4 bioweapons labs and put them in level 3 and level 2 containment.
[00:27:26.517 --> 00:27:28.458]  And they're building one down in Galveston.
[00:27:28.518 --> 00:27:33.539]  Before that could happen, it was about to open, the hurricane hit it and it's destroyed.
[00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:34.779]  That's smart.
[00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:36.420]  Build one on a hurricane coastline.
[00:27:37.463 --> 00:27:41.165]  San Antonio's getting a level four built in the university down there.
[00:27:41.785 --> 00:27:48.208]  They're moving Plum Island from New York, the zoological bioweapons lab, the most deadly stuff you can imagine.
[00:27:49.009 --> 00:27:54.312]  Ebola, weaponized limes, the list goes on and on, stuff we don't even know about, to San Antonio.
[00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:56.493]  And there's 34 more of these babies!
[00:27:57.526 --> 00:27:58.867]  Who works in these facilities?
[00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:00.068]  Who has connections to them?
[00:28:00.889 --> 00:28:06.593]  Dr. Pianka saying he wants an airborne Ebola to kill 90% of us and he gets standing ovations at universities.
[00:28:07.234 --> 00:28:08.394]  See, you start connecting.
[00:28:10.056 --> 00:28:11.097]  Let's expand from there.
[00:28:13.018 --> 00:28:21.725]  September 10th, Associated Press reported months later that September 10th, the White House cabinet went on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic, because of concerns of anthrax.
[00:28:22.657 --> 00:28:24.858]  Then it gets mailed out to all of Bush's enemies.
[00:28:24.898 --> 00:28:25.778]  They start dying.
[00:28:26.118 --> 00:28:28.419]  Turns out it's the most weaponized anthrax ever seen.
[00:28:29.419 --> 00:28:31.940]  And the media says, no, it was made in a bathtub in a basement.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.281]  No, it didn't come out of a base.
[00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:36.822]  Then it turns out it was the Ames Strain, Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[00:28:37.342 --> 00:28:46.645]  Miniaturized, and then weaponized, and had wings in a nanotech facility that only Fort Detrick can do.
[00:28:48.428 --> 00:28:54.932]  Wings microscopically put on every spore so that it gets picked up by the slightest breezes.
[00:28:57.734 --> 00:28:59.615]  This gets mailed out to all of Bush's enemies.
[00:28:59.655 --> 00:29:01.977]  He's on the anthrax-fighting Cipro antibiotic.
[00:29:04.798 --> 00:29:09.081]  People that put two and two together and figure out it's the government get FBI visits and threats.
[00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:10.662]  Horowitz, Dr. Horowitz, and others.
[00:29:11.623 --> 00:29:12.683]  All of this is going on.
[00:29:13.646 --> 00:29:17.609]  We'll come back and finish up with the other key info and how this ties in with some other things.
[00:29:17.629 --> 00:29:21.012]  Because they're announcing swine flu popping up in California.
[00:29:23.414 --> 00:29:26.176]  Ebola popping up in the Philippines.
[00:29:27.037 --> 00:29:28.878]  They're hyping all these new vaccines.
[00:29:28.898 --> 00:29:32.681]  We got a mix in live, weaponized bird flu in with vaccine in Europe.
[00:29:34.102 --> 00:29:37.865]  And suddenly all these people dropping dead when they take a bird flu vaccine.
[00:29:38.446 --> 00:29:39.287]  Something's going on.
[00:29:40.307 --> 00:29:41.208]  We're on the march.
[00:29:41.709 --> 00:29:43.210]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:44.219 --> 00:29:46.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:49.882 --> 00:29:50.422]  You worry.
[00:29:50.562 --> 00:29:52.643]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:29:52.923 --> 00:29:53.203]  Hi.
[00:29:53.463 --> 00:29:55.945]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:29:56.245 --> 00:30:00.507]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:30:00.787 --> 00:30:02.988]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:30:03.268 --> 00:30:06.309]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:30:06.609 --> 00:30:08.330]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.991]  Her wild food knowledge package is
[00:30:10.011 --> 00:30:11.931]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[00:30:11.971 --> 00:30:13.092]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[00:30:13.112 --> 00:30:14.692]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:30:39.005 --> 00:30:39.646]  Start now.
[00:30:39.906 --> 00:30:40.888]  Knowledge is power.
[00:30:41.629 --> 00:30:42.450]  Better take action.
[00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:43.672]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:30:50.541 --> 00:30:55.769]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:30:56.568 --> 00:31:01.911]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:02.431 --> 00:31:08.635]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:08.935 --> 00:31:10.756]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:10.916 --> 00:31:13.297]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:13.377 --> 00:31:24.243]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:26.545 --> 00:31:27.825]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:28.225 --> 00:31:29.626]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:30.066 --> 00:31:36.388]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:32:42.483 --> 00:32:47.304]  So we got all these mysterious things going on and anytime Fort Detrick tells you something's missing you gotta look out because
[00:33:11.994 --> 00:33:27.058]  There was a little-noticed report by the Bioweapons Lab in England, Porton Down, that said, oh, we lost some vials, or somebody stole some vials of foot-and-mouth the day that it was supposedly being spread.
[00:33:27.098 --> 00:33:29.659]  Two days later, it pops up in locations all over the country.
[00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:32.240]  One person, two people, ten people couldn't have done it.
[00:33:33.834 --> 00:33:36.355]  They sneak into a level four bioweapons lab.
[00:33:37.195 --> 00:33:38.296]  Somebody steals it.
[00:33:38.376 --> 00:33:44.158]  It's got machine gun nests, barbed wire, minefields, underground pressure facilities, big vault doors.
[00:33:44.758 --> 00:33:45.538]  That's level four.
[00:33:45.939 --> 00:33:48.099]  They sneak in, they get it, and they spread it all over the country.
[00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:53.961]  And the government goes around killing eight million sheep, four million cows that weren't even infected.
[00:33:55.502 --> 00:33:57.703]  And the images, you know, all those big piles of cows burning.
[00:33:58.922 --> 00:34:04.586]  And then we predicted the government wouldn't let people restock and they said, yes, it's not sustainable, you're not allowed to restock cows and sheep.
[00:34:07.749 --> 00:34:09.950]  They're waging war on agriculture.
[00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:11.171]  They want control of it.
[00:34:11.191 --> 00:34:14.574]  They want to use it as a tool of control for their one-child policies.
[00:34:14.914 --> 00:34:22.820]  By the way, England and Australia, two days ago, we haven't even gotten to that, that's in the stack, I know Burma's covered it, have announced they want officially a one-child policy.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.121]  Now I told you when I made Endgame two years ago,
[00:34:26.249 --> 00:34:33.099]  Almost two years ago, when I have talked on air that these new rules about, oh we want to tax you if you have more than one child.
[00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:38.771]  That's a one-child policy, and now they're admitting it, so that's happening.
[00:34:38.811 --> 00:34:40.112]  That's what all this control is about.
[00:34:40.492 --> 00:34:42.453]  But then you have U.S.
[00:34:42.493 --> 00:34:50.537]  officials track new flu strain from pigs, and they're saying, you know, it's similar to the bird flu, on and on and on.
[00:34:51.098 --> 00:34:52.598]  We may have to take vaccines.
[00:34:52.638 --> 00:34:56.701]  They just so happen to have a vaccine mass-produced for this pig.
[00:34:57.641 --> 00:35:24.584]  uh... virus they just so happen to have this uh... horse virus notice the government of australia last year accidentally released the horse virus we were just talking about that earlier in the week they can kill humans and they said oh an accident from our laboratory okay well let's just say this is all accidents it's an accident that in fake you know arab handwriting in english it was meant to look like somebody who couldn't speak english wrote it
[00:35:25.461 --> 00:35:30.282]  With Allah's Great Death of the West gets mailed out from Fort Detrick, just an accident.
[00:35:30.942 --> 00:35:34.703]  And Foot and Mouth gets released from Horton Down by accident.
[00:35:34.723 --> 00:35:36.684]  And it gets released from Australia by accident.
[00:35:36.724 --> 00:35:38.304]  And you just continue.
[00:35:38.644 --> 00:35:39.584]  Come on in, what's going on?
[00:35:43.605 --> 00:35:44.466]  Every 15 minutes?
[00:35:46.606 --> 00:35:47.546]  Oh, you found the program?
[00:35:47.626 --> 00:35:49.367]  Yeah, Aaron found me their basic printouts.
[00:35:49.387 --> 00:35:50.527]  What you're saying, it's just amazing?
[00:35:52.347 --> 00:35:53.088]  I mean, it's off the hook.
[00:35:53.128 --> 00:35:53.788]  Tell us what you found.
[00:35:54.793 --> 00:35:55.674]  Let's turn his mic on.
[00:35:55.694 --> 00:35:56.134]  What did you find?
[00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:56.314]  Go ahead.
[00:35:56.334 --> 00:36:00.037]  There's a death notice right here that they're going to inform the parents.
[00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:01.197]  You've got to talk on the mic, they're saying.
[00:36:01.318 --> 00:36:03.819]  There's a permission slip to participate in the program.
[00:36:03.939 --> 00:36:10.304]  Okay, and then it goes on to, let's see, it talks about health information, media release, mock death notification.
[00:36:10.704 --> 00:36:15.807]  I agreed to receive a mock death notification from my son and daughter as part of the Every 15 Minutes program.
[00:36:16.428 --> 00:36:17.709]  Obituary information.
[00:36:19.106 --> 00:36:23.848]  Um, so basically... Well, see, it's a death call, but see, that's for DWI, so people think it sounds reasonable.
[00:36:24.268 --> 00:36:27.089]  They have it where it's unannounced, they come and say they're gonna kill you.
[00:36:27.569 --> 00:36:33.991]  I'm, I'm... The Grim Reaper will come to class and take one of the students away, and then someone will read the student's obituary.
[00:36:36.772 --> 00:36:38.933]  Well, they have the studies, this cause of suicide.
[00:36:38.973 --> 00:36:41.094]  I mean, kids think about death, they shouldn't be thinking about it.
[00:36:41.114 --> 00:36:42.875]  That's all part of messing their brains up.
[00:36:43.455 --> 00:36:44.535]  Alright, thank you so much.
[00:36:45.316 --> 00:36:46.336]  Okay, um...
[00:36:48.229 --> 00:36:49.570]  Let me just go ahead and get into that now.
[00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:57.455]  Let me go ahead and start the presentation for everybody on this subject.
[00:36:59.316 --> 00:37:00.917]  Go ahead and get that out of my stack.
[00:37:02.358 --> 00:37:03.419]  Go ahead and focus.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.721]  And go over this.
[00:37:06.761 --> 00:37:13.405]  In fact, while I take a break to go back over these notes, because I want to do this as a focused presentation, let me play an important blurb here.
[00:37:13.425 --> 00:37:17.488]  Did the network send you the Ron Paul clip?
[00:37:18.775 --> 00:37:22.096]  Oh, well, that's okay, because the network has the audio of it.
[00:37:22.816 --> 00:37:24.616]  So the network has the audio of this.
[00:37:24.696 --> 00:37:27.637]  YouTube's down, so we can't play it from their servers.
[00:37:29.017 --> 00:37:46.080]  Last night, I just turned the TV on when Hardball was re-airing, before I went for a jog, and I saw Chris Matthews saying, coming up, the girl that used to love Barry Goldwater, Hillary Clinton, she
[00:37:47.762 --> 00:37:48.863]  Compliments Ron Paul.
[00:37:50.103 --> 00:38:00.950]  And they're now being forced to do this because they know that we are becoming the majority.
[00:38:03.211 --> 00:38:06.293]  And so she's there trying to kiss up to him so he won't ask her tough questions.
[00:38:09.005 --> 00:38:22.137]  But also, you see this on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, everywhere, they talk about Ron Paul and how great he is, and Bill Maher does it, because they recognize he is the figurehead of probably 80, 90 million people in this country.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.602]  So all we've got to do is stand up and take action.
[00:38:27.622 --> 00:38:30.525]  For all of you out there that said, oh, the Ron Paul revolution, he didn't win, we failed.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.961]  That was only one benchmark in educating and growing our numbers.
[00:38:34.981 --> 00:38:37.381]  And then we grow them again, we grow them again, we grow them again.
[00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:45.423]  And they're scared of us because they don't care if you're wandering off as a liberal in that controlled paradigm or wandering off as a fake Republican in that controlled paradigm.
[00:38:45.723 --> 00:38:49.684]  You really get into liberty and freedom, Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.
[00:38:50.205 --> 00:38:52.845]  That scares the establishment.
[00:38:53.465 --> 00:38:54.806]  That scares them in a big way.
[00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:58.867]  So let's go ahead and play the audio of this clip.
[00:38:58.887 --> 00:38:59.227]  Here it is.
[00:38:59.997 --> 00:39:03.719]  The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Paul, is recognized for five minutes.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.281]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Madam Secretary.
[00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:24.692]  I have a general question I want to ask about foreign policy, but leading up to that question, I would like to mention first that the election had something to do with bringing about change in tone with our foreign policy, and I think there's been some very positive changes in tone, and
[00:39:26.853 --> 00:39:33.861]  Many of us have argued for more diplomacy rather than more threats, so many of us are pleased with that.
[00:39:34.662 --> 00:39:47.977]  It goes back to the old saying of speaking softly and still being willing to carry a big stick, but sometimes I wonder whether that big stick doesn't get wielded a little too often and too often.
[00:39:48.604 --> 00:40:02.212]  But I do want to caution all of us that what we say is very important and can be very beneficial, but what we do is also very important, so that may cancel out the benefits of speaking more softly and being willing to talk and negotiate.
[00:40:02.873 --> 00:40:09.777]  Some people say that we shouldn't talk to our enemies, but I remember the Cold War rather well, and we did talk to Khrushchev and
[00:40:10.197 --> 00:40:10.637]  We're good.
[00:40:28.476 --> 00:40:37.320]  But my big concern is whether or not we can reverse the empire mentality that I think we have adopted over these many, many decades.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.361]  And also the relationship of this to our financial burden.
[00:40:42.162 --> 00:40:57.208]  Though we are speaking more softly and would like to get some troops home, the first thing that was done was our DOD budget was increased by 9% in a time when our national debt in the last 12 months went up $2 trillion.
[00:40:58.115 --> 00:41:01.940]  All great nations have been brought to the news for economic reasons.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.521]  We didn't have to fight the Soviets.
[00:41:04.002 --> 00:41:10.650]  And the Afghanistan adventure that the Russians and the Soviets were involved with was very significant.
[00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:14.054]  And I don't know how we can ignore that.
[00:41:14.594 --> 00:41:18.319]  So I would like to ask the question about
[00:41:18.903 --> 00:41:26.326]  Whether or not you can give me some signs or indication or some encouragement that maybe we shifted policies in the slightest manner.
[00:41:26.666 --> 00:41:28.287]  Have we brought any troops home?
[00:41:29.347 --> 00:41:31.068]  Are we less involved in Iraq?
[00:41:31.428 --> 00:41:32.889]  Will that war ever end?
[00:41:33.409 --> 00:41:43.953]  Or are we really going in the opposite direction because we're seeing Pakistan is so necessary, we need more troops, more expansion, more money, more DOD funds.
[00:41:44.573 --> 00:41:46.794]  So, coming from my perspective,
[00:41:47.236 --> 00:41:48.337]  I can't see the difference.
[00:41:48.637 --> 00:41:54.362]  Even though, like I said, I am pleased that there's a willingness to talk and try to work things out.
[00:41:54.702 --> 00:41:56.323]  And I think that is very positive.
[00:41:56.464 --> 00:41:59.326]  I always think that people who aren't willing to talk are insecure.
[00:41:59.346 --> 00:42:07.873]  This whole idea that we are so strong, to me, it seems that we lack confidence if we can't talk to people.
[00:42:08.193 --> 00:42:09.294]  And we are strong enough.
[00:42:09.374 --> 00:42:11.356]  Nobody's going to attack us militarily.
[00:42:12.117 --> 00:42:16.180]  So I see it very important that we change our tone.
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:20.945]  I think it's good that you got rid of the term war on terrorism.
[00:42:21.145 --> 00:42:23.287]  How can you have war against a tactic?
[00:42:23.788 --> 00:42:24.549]  It doesn't make any sense.
[00:42:24.789 --> 00:42:28.673]  But I'm not sure overseas contingency operation is more specific.
[00:42:28.953 --> 00:42:36.260]  So could you address that and maybe give me some hints as far as maybe seeing actual some shift in our policy?
[00:42:36.803 --> 00:42:37.864]  Well, thank you, Congressman.
[00:42:38.384 --> 00:42:47.011]  I think that the President's actions in these nearly 100 days do match actions with words, although I admit there's a lot more to be done.
[00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:51.195]  We are still sorting out everything we've inherited and trying to make sense of it.
[00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:57.119]  You know, we want to protect America's national security, but we think there are better and more effective ways of doing that.
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.321]  So we are ending the war in Iraq.
[00:42:59.601 --> 00:43:03.044]  There is a definite end date for our troops to be there.
[00:43:03.645 --> 00:43:05.406]  The President did close Guantanamo.
[00:43:06.018 --> 00:43:16.423]  The President is looking for ways to engage with those who nobody wanted us to talk to, which is a sea shift in how we are proceeding.
[00:43:17.443 --> 00:43:19.544]  Words and actions both matter.
[00:43:19.764 --> 00:43:23.086]  I mean, at the end of the day, actions count more.
[00:43:24.026 --> 00:43:27.748]  But you have to begin by at least articulating a new approach.
[00:43:28.779 --> 00:43:30.181]  John, stop right there for a minute.
[00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:35.445]  Later she grovels to him and says how great he is and how he has the most enthusiastic supporters.
[00:43:35.926 --> 00:43:37.187]  I don't know if we'll have time to get to that.
[00:43:37.227 --> 00:43:39.169]  This is a different clip than I thought I'd sent the network.
[00:43:39.209 --> 00:43:41.171]  I mean, he's in there later groveling.
[00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:44.273]  You can watch it up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:45.094 --> 00:43:47.076]  But that's a whole other subject I had in my stack.
[00:43:47.096 --> 00:43:50.639]  Her saying he's matched his words with deeds.
[00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:57.384]  He signed an order saying we might close Guantanamo in a year, but we're going to use all these other holding facilities in the U.S.
[00:43:57.425 --> 00:44:01.248]  and overseas and continue holding detainees without rights.
[00:44:01.388 --> 00:44:05.992]  In fact, Google Obama backs Bush on no rights for detainees.
[00:44:06.392 --> 00:44:07.753]  Let's put that on screen for folks.
[00:44:08.194 --> 00:44:09.375]  That's AP.
[00:44:10.782 --> 00:44:12.744]  And he said that all of this continues.
[00:44:13.104 --> 00:44:14.805]  The secret rendition continues.
[00:44:15.846 --> 00:44:17.347]  All of this is continuing.
[00:44:24.513 --> 00:44:27.715]  Obama backs Bush on no rights for detainees.
[00:44:28.016 --> 00:44:29.497]  He's hired nothing but lobbyists.
[00:44:29.537 --> 00:44:30.678]  He's increasing the wars.
[00:44:32.386 --> 00:44:40.452]  And she just says, she goes on, because I've got the text of it, or she's given another speech, there's so many she gives, where she says, and he's balancing the budget.
[00:44:40.732 --> 00:44:42.314]  What on earth are they talking about?
[00:44:42.614 --> 00:44:54.623]  They're spending more money than all the presidents before him combined, and he keeps saying he's going to cut the budget deficit in half in two years and balance it by the end of four years.
[00:44:56.604 --> 00:44:59.365]  Obama backs Bush on policy on detainee rights.
[00:45:00.145 --> 00:45:05.286]  And the exact headline, that's uh... what is that out of the US News and World Report?
[00:45:06.226 --> 00:45:07.707]  That's CBS News, I couldn't read the top.
[00:45:08.267 --> 00:45:12.528]  The exact one is, Obama backs Bush on no rights for detainees.
[00:45:13.348 --> 00:45:14.169]  There, you get the idea.
[00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:17.769]  The point is, they're keeping the camps open, it's all continuing.
[00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:22.431]  And I always told you, Guantanamo's not even the real camp.
[00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:23.211]  Guantanamo's kind of a
[00:45:24.312 --> 00:45:41.023]  Advertisement camp, or what they show you publicly, not the black sites all over the world, and that's now been declassified, and the White House memo saying they wanted Bush to be dictator, and to restrict the free press in the United States, and this is all being set up, and it's continuing under Obama.
[00:45:41.283 --> 00:45:42.764]  We did get Barbara back.
[00:45:43.024 --> 00:45:44.265]  The phone systems went down earlier.
[00:45:45.675 --> 00:45:58.045]  She called in and talked about how they're doing this death education at the school, how they're going to lock down the school, how it coincides with a weird lockdown drill of Seward, Alaska.
[00:45:58.545 --> 00:46:05.991]  And we asked her to fax us proof of that, and she faxed us the Homeland Security Officer, Transportation Secretary Administration she talked to.
[00:46:07.462 --> 00:46:31.581]  uh... and so just a briefly tell us exactly what's happening at the school exactly what they're doing in the town cuz i keep getting calls and emails they're non-specific about they've told us they're locking the town down for a FEMA drill what is going on okay uh... that the card that i sent to you was given to me by a man whom i
[00:46:33.226 --> 00:46:34.507]  Mysteriously met.
[00:46:35.027 --> 00:46:47.472]  I dropped my daughter off to a coffee shop to work and I'm sitting on the couch looking out the window and a friend is with me and we're watching this man walking up and down the streets looking at our car, kind of strange, and holding something in his hand and looking at the buildings.
[00:46:48.492 --> 00:46:53.634]  And he's kind of looking underneath and around up and down the streets and we're going, what is he doing?
[00:46:53.674 --> 00:46:54.935]  I said, well I'm going to go find out.
[00:46:54.995 --> 00:46:58.036]  So I walked right out and approached him and said, hi, may I help you?
[00:46:58.897 --> 00:46:59.237]  And he
[00:47:01.172 --> 00:47:19.302]  He picked up some pictures that were black and white photos of Seward's buildings and he said, you know it's funny, I used to work here when I was about 19 and I'm just kind of traveling back and looking around at Seward, seeing if I can find some of the old places I used to be and I'm just kind of matching up the buildings.
[00:47:19.362 --> 00:47:24.885]  I want to take some pictures of right where I was standing, seeing if I could re-trace my steps.
[00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:25.986]  And I said, oh really?
[00:47:27.086 --> 00:47:37.048]  Yeah, I know some people who live here, have been here all these years, maybe they remember you and he couldn't even give me the name of the place he worked for and it was a little suspicious.
[00:47:37.128 --> 00:47:39.729]  So he goes, I'll tell you what, I have more photos.
[00:47:40.029 --> 00:47:45.050]  I'm going to run down here where I'm staying and I'll tell you what, I'll buy a cup of coffee from you and I'll come in and I'll talk to you.
[00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:52.252]  So I just kind of went in to the coffee shop and this man came back with more pictures but as he began to go through his pictures,
[00:47:52.827 --> 00:47:59.192]  He kind of flipped up on one of them because as he was showing, yeah, this is down, you know where this is, blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:59.532 --> 00:48:04.136]  Then he handed us a picture and says, and this church is in your town, right?
[00:48:04.556 --> 00:48:07.399]  And we go, uh, yeah, it's right over there.
[00:48:07.479 --> 00:48:09.040]  I mean, you can see it from where we are.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.783]  So we, at first, and then we said, so where are you from?
[00:48:12.843 --> 00:48:14.064]  And he says, Washington DC.
[00:48:14.144 --> 00:48:16.226]  And I said, oh, okay, great.
[00:48:16.446 --> 00:48:18.287]  And my friend says, so what do you do there?
[00:48:19.148 --> 00:48:20.689]  Um, I'm with Homeland Security.
[00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.550]  And I said,
[00:48:22.273 --> 00:48:35.121]  Oh, then he kind of changed his tone a little bit and he started telling us these stories about how to, um, he said, you know, when you, when you want to find a terrorist, you just, uh, if you see a cute little bunny out there on the railroad tracks, what do you do?
[00:48:35.161 --> 00:48:36.442]  You run over and pick up a little bunny.
[00:48:36.462 --> 00:48:37.363]  That's how terrorists work.
[00:48:37.803 --> 00:48:41.805]  And he started with these like random stories and we're going, Oh, okay.
[00:48:42.106 --> 00:48:43.767]  Uh, yeah, I never thought of that.
[00:48:44.387 --> 00:48:46.889]  Uh, and then he mentioned a little bit about Afghanistan.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:59.750]  I mean, one minute we're talking about, oh yeah, you used to live here in Seward and we know people, and the next minute, oh, he's been exposed.
[00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:04.574]  They've got a lot of good Christians, too, that really think there's Islamofascism taking over.
[00:49:04.594 --> 00:49:09.059]  They don't know the West actually funded it and helped it as a bulwark against communism and that they run it.
[00:49:09.419 --> 00:49:10.260]  And they all killed
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.321]  Yeah, I think.
[00:49:26.462 --> 00:49:31.146]  Okay, what I found out was, I said, he said, well actually I'm here on business.
[00:49:31.666 --> 00:49:33.087]  He said, um, I said, really?
[00:49:33.127 --> 00:49:42.495]  I said, I'm going to that meeting tomorrow at the city council, you know, that they're holding about the, you know, shutdown of these bridges at the end of town and they're not letting us in and out.
[00:49:42.535 --> 00:49:47.479]  So we're going to meet with the Department of Transportation and he kind of just blew that off and he gave me his card and he said, well,
[00:49:49.724 --> 00:49:54.905]  The more I offered information for him about his past life as a steward, he didn't want to talk to anybody.
[00:49:54.945 --> 00:49:56.066]  He said he's leaving town.
[00:49:56.386 --> 00:50:01.747]  He has meetings in Anchorage the next day and he'll be in Anchorage all week until Saturday.
[00:50:02.387 --> 00:50:09.469]  Well, supposedly this bridge is being shut down and I just got, my daughter just grabbed, I'm going to fax it to you right away.
[00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:11.810]  This is more information on the 15-minute program.
[00:50:12.597 --> 00:50:12.817]  I'm good.
[00:50:25.566 --> 00:50:26.426]  Oh, they do have their meds.
[00:50:26.646 --> 00:50:26.886]  Okay.
[00:50:27.687 --> 00:50:33.749]  Anyway, this man... But I mean to be clear though, they're going to be locked up in the school while they shut down the town and the roads, correct?
[00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:42.692]  Yes, and on the permission slip, if you read that closely, it says they're going to be with enforcement officers, let's see, law enforcement officials and other
[00:50:43.658 --> 00:50:44.459]  Stay there.
[00:50:44.519 --> 00:50:46.061]  I mean, let's put a bow on this when we get back.

[00:51:50.136 --> 00:51:55.442]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:51:55.943 --> 00:52:02.931]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:03.527 --> 00:52:09.714]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:10.114 --> 00:52:11.956]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:14.499]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:14.579 --> 00:52:25.551]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:26.158 --> 00:52:27.438]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:27.818 --> 00:52:29.199]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:36.001]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:52:53.786 --> 00:52:58.427]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief is?
[00:52:58.707 --> 00:53:01.128]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.
[00:53:01.268 --> 00:53:06.529]  The bailout group has settled over $100 million in credit card debt for people just like you.

[00:53:44.468 --> 00:53:44.969]  Barbara!
[00:53:57.964 --> 00:53:59.484]  What I'm trying to find out is this.
[00:54:00.265 --> 00:54:08.087]  I'm getting emails and calls from people separately from you saying they've been told Seward is being shut down for a Homeland Security drill.
[00:54:08.407 --> 00:54:13.809]  Then I get mainstream articles about how they're shutting down the bridge and other roads into it this weekend.
[00:54:14.709 --> 00:54:17.110]  It's coinciding with a weekend drill at the school.
[00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:21.371]  There's a Homeland Security guy snooping around taking pictures of buildings.
[00:54:22.551 --> 00:54:24.012]  I mean, let's say you had 60 seconds.
[00:54:24.152 --> 00:54:25.272]  What's going on in your town?
[00:54:26.249 --> 00:54:30.831]  Okay, I want to reiterate, there are no other roads into Seward only than one.
[00:54:31.312 --> 00:54:32.552]  There is one road into Seward.
[00:54:32.572 --> 00:54:33.813]  I know it sounds strange, but there is.
[00:54:36.034 --> 00:54:51.782]  We have been told that the bridges, which have been there for years, which have had problems, all of a sudden need to be inspected and they're shutting down our town this coming weekend, Friday through Monday morning, Friday night at 10 through Monday morning.
[00:54:52.768 --> 00:54:55.030]  And there's no other way to change the schedule.
[00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:56.472]  They can't do it any other time.
[00:54:56.912 --> 00:54:58.053]  It has to be now.
[00:54:58.274 --> 00:55:01.957]  And that's confirmed with our city council.
[00:55:02.017 --> 00:55:02.498]  Okay, yes, yes.
[00:55:02.518 --> 00:55:03.419]  That's in the news.
[00:55:03.459 --> 00:55:03.979]  That's in the news.
[00:55:03.999 --> 00:55:05.421]  People are mad about that because of terrorism.
[00:55:05.921 --> 00:55:08.444]  Why are people telling me about a lockdown in the town?
[00:55:08.764 --> 00:55:09.465]  And what is this?
[00:55:09.525 --> 00:55:11.287]  What else does Homeland Security got to tell you?
[00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:18.797]  This Homeland Security man just told me, he gave me his card, and it's really funny because when he left he didn't ask our names or anything.
[00:55:19.257 --> 00:55:23.622]  He said, I'll see you later, or I'll see you soon, I'll see you next time.
[00:55:23.902 --> 00:55:25.023]  And I thought, what?
[00:55:25.123 --> 00:55:27.245]  I thought he was leaving and going to Anchorage for meetings.
[00:55:27.285 --> 00:55:30.389]  And he told me he was going to be in Anchorage all week until Saturday.
[00:55:30.969 --> 00:55:32.611]  So, I was just
[00:55:32.987 --> 00:55:37.268]  It was kind of blowing me away because it says transportation security on his card.
[00:55:37.528 --> 00:55:40.209]  And I thought, does this coincide with the bridge?
[00:55:40.289 --> 00:55:42.289]  Okay, anything else you can tell us, Barbara?
[00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:44.290]  That's it.
[00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:45.130]  That's all I got.
[00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:46.490]  Thank you so much for the info.
[00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:47.791]  Send us the other thing about the school.
[00:55:47.851 --> 00:55:48.251]  Thank you.
[00:55:50.111 --> 00:55:50.971]  So fax that to us.
[00:55:51.031 --> 00:55:55.773]  Okay, let me go ahead because we got Alan Combs at 8 after in the second segment of the next hour.
[00:55:56.033 --> 00:55:57.673]  Some stations don't carry that first five minutes.
[00:55:57.693 --> 00:55:59.354]  We wish you would, but c'est la vie.
[00:56:02.571 --> 00:56:04.572]  Here's the stack of news I have, okay?
[00:56:05.553 --> 00:56:07.695]  Death education at Columbine High.
[00:56:08.235 --> 00:56:11.958]  School shooting drill terrifies unknowing teachers.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.402]  Classroom trash can used as toilet.
[00:56:18.082 --> 00:56:20.143]  School boost preparations for attack.
[00:56:20.564 --> 00:56:23.826]  Many anti-terror plans would stop parents from picking up children.
[00:56:24.166 --> 00:56:25.167]  That's the Washington Post.
[00:56:26.128 --> 00:56:27.148]  I should be listing these.
[00:56:27.168 --> 00:56:28.369]  This is World Net Daily.
[00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:30.211]  WCAU-TV.
[00:56:32.547 --> 00:56:34.949]  This classroom trash cans used as toilets.
[00:56:35.629 --> 00:56:36.810]  Associated Press.
[00:56:37.931 --> 00:56:41.994]  This is a PrisonPlanet.com article, but it's links to all the mainstream news articles.
[00:56:42.574 --> 00:56:46.097]  State brainwashing children to re-educate their parents for green dictatorship.
[00:56:47.558 --> 00:56:51.281]  UPI High Court weighs school strip searches.
[00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:54.223]  Says, yes, strip searching children with no probable cause is good.
[00:56:56.184 --> 00:56:58.346]  This is out of the Pensacola News Journal.
[00:56:59.892 --> 00:57:05.415]  Where the Marines personnel take over your classrooms, declare martial law to school children at gunpoint.
[00:57:07.656 --> 00:57:08.716]  Can't make this stuff up.
[00:57:09.316 --> 00:57:10.197]  Here's another one.
[00:57:10.897 --> 00:57:15.059]  Michigan school district portrays homeschoolers as terrorists, Associated Press.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.101]  Armed men terrorize school.
[00:57:19.141 --> 00:57:24.103]  Michigan raid part of unfolding agenda to mold schools into prisons and students into obedient slaves.
[00:57:24.123 --> 00:57:25.884]  That's a Paul Watson article, 2006, with AP links.
[00:57:28.949 --> 00:57:33.171]  Let's have that ready first when we come back, because I want to show folks how they click on the AP there.
[00:57:36.372 --> 00:57:39.553]  Girl handing out cough drops accused of selling drugs at schools.
[00:57:39.573 --> 00:57:44.595]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:57:45.175 --> 00:57:49.957]  And then multi-agency mock terror attack training at Catalina Foothills High School.
[00:57:52.058 --> 00:57:54.899]  Hostage drill prepares schools for crisis.
[00:57:56.311 --> 00:57:59.474]  I got a bunch of these when they unannounced, grab the kids and take them to FEMA camps.
[00:58:01.695 --> 00:58:02.956]  That's just some of what I got here.
[00:58:02.976 --> 00:58:06.079]  I'm going to go over this when we get back.
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.662]  And this is mind control.
[00:58:09.842 --> 00:58:10.963]  I mean, that's what's going on here.
[00:58:10.983 --> 00:58:19.009]  This is to traumatize them, to teach them learned helplessness, to teach them to go into the FEMA camps, to teach them to be under the system's control.
[00:58:19.932 --> 00:58:21.373]  We got Alan Combs coming up.
[00:58:21.433 --> 00:58:23.134]  I'm going to ask him about the Bilderberg Rib.
[00:58:23.934 --> 00:58:25.775]  I'm going to ask him, does the New World Order exist?
[00:58:26.315 --> 00:58:26.996]  And a lot more.
[00:58:27.016 --> 00:58:28.476]  Stay with us.
[00:58:28.496 --> 00:58:35.420]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:39.687 --> 00:58:41.248]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:41.368 --> 00:58:46.029]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:48.870]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:58:49.071 --> 00:58:51.932]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:58:52.112 --> 00:58:57.974]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:58:58.194 --> 00:59:01.417]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation that you need.
[00:59:01.437 --> 00:59:08.342]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:08.422 --> 00:59:11.545]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:28.855 --> 00:59:29.895]  Take action today.
[00:59:29.915 --> 00:59:31.916]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:42.344 --> 00:59:44.244]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:44.725 --> 00:59:47.705]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:51.206 --> 01:00:11.090]  One of the most important stories out there today is the fact that all over the Western world, Europe,
[01:00:16.187 --> 01:00:18.048]  Australia, the United States, Canada.
[01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:26.814]  The police show up unannounced, put guns to kids' heads, and they generally say, we're here from the pro-Second Amendment group, we're here to kill you.
[01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:30.816]  Or they say, we're the homeschooler group, we're here to kill you.
[01:00:31.297 --> 01:00:33.178]  They obviously demonize patriots and homeschoolers.
[01:00:33.198 --> 01:00:37.381]  We said, um, you know, years ago we would talk about how
[01:00:38.581 --> 01:00:47.530]  They're training the general public that the American people are terrorists, and gun owners are terrorists, and that this whole anti-Al Qaeda system is being built for the American people.
[01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:49.933]  And now it's all admitted and declassified.
[01:00:50.634 --> 01:00:52.376]  As you know, all these federal reports coming out.
[01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.551]  But we'll put it up on screen.
[01:00:55.572 --> 01:00:58.034]  This is an article Paul Watson wrote November 1st, 2006.
[01:00:58.935 --> 01:01:00.697]  Armed men terrorize school.
[01:01:01.437 --> 01:01:06.362]  Michigan raid, part of an unfolding agenda to mold schools into prisons and students into obedient slaves.
[01:01:07.183 --> 01:01:10.767]  And in that article, you can click on the first hyperlink, if you scroll down a little bit.
[01:01:12.219 --> 01:01:14.340]  It says Associated Press, you click on that.
[01:01:15.081 --> 01:01:20.363]  Who knows if that article in two years is still even there, but we can't live on air click on that article?
[01:01:21.004 --> 01:01:25.966]  For folks, yes, see, AP's taking it down, but you can go through, I guess, and register and get it.
[01:01:25.986 --> 01:01:28.387]  That's why we write these articles to document what's going on.
[01:01:31.489 --> 01:01:33.110]  And it gets into what they're doing.
[01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:36.234]  At these schools.
[01:01:36.814 --> 01:01:38.535]  So let me go ahead and read over this article.
[01:01:39.115 --> 01:01:58.987]  A recent incident in which armed riot police raided a Michigan junior high school as part of a drill that the children were not aware of was about to take place raises the bar in the pursuit of an agenda to fully transform public schools into prison training camps set up to breed continuous generations of obedient slaves.
[01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:00.488]  The AP reports, and here's the quotes.
[01:02:02.068 --> 01:02:10.072]  A school safety drill that included police officers in riot gear and weapons has caused concern among some people who say it was too realistic and frightened some students.
[01:02:10.613 --> 01:02:18.017]  Students who were unaware police were conducting a drill were taken from their classroom in the halls, patted down by officers, and asked what they had in their pockets.
[01:02:18.437 --> 01:02:21.979]  Some of the kids were so scared, they called it a drill to get around the Fourth Amendment.
[01:02:22.779 --> 01:02:25.360]  Some of the kids were so scared they just about wet their pants.
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.581]  Well, I talked to parents, they did wet them.
[01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:31.763]  Said Marjorie Bradshaw, a parent with four children in the Godfrey Lee schools.
[01:02:31.823 --> 01:02:35.785]  I think it's pure wrong that the students and the parents were not informed of this.
[01:02:35.825 --> 01:02:40.888]  The students were not told the drill was about to take place and the teachers were given just a moment's notice.
[01:02:41.928 --> 01:02:47.931]  This follows an incident in early October where another Michigan school was locked down for hours after a teenager was seen in the woods wearing a Halloween mask.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:03:06.904]  The rave is similar to those in Goose Creek, South Carolina, where armed police raided a high school with weapons drawn, supposedly in search of drugs, shouting police officers aimed guns at students' heads and were ordered face up against the wall in the Guantanamo-style squats as they were handcuffed before canine dogs simped their backpacks.
[01:03:07.264 --> 01:03:08.444]  Actually attacked their backpacks.
[01:03:09.004 --> 01:03:11.145]  No drugs were found at the Goose Creek Police Department.
[01:03:11.165 --> 01:03:11.505]  The city
[01:03:12.225 --> 01:03:15.506]  As well as the Berkeley County School District had to pay 1.6 million.
[01:03:16.066 --> 01:03:17.426]  Okay, this isn't the article.
[01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:21.587]  I want the Michigan AP article where they're throwing the fake blood on them.
[01:03:21.627 --> 01:03:23.468]  I saw you had it on screen when you were looking earlier.
[01:03:23.488 --> 01:03:27.729]  Where they're throwing fake blood on them and saying, we're homeschoolers here to kill you.
[01:03:27.749 --> 01:03:33.110]  There's just too many of these.
[01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:35.330]  I'll find it during the break.
[01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:37.331]  After Helen Combs is here, I'll do 30 minutes on it.
[01:03:38.268 --> 01:03:41.592]  School shooting drill terrifies unknowing teachers.
[01:03:42.393 --> 01:03:43.914]  WCAU-TV.
[01:03:45.396 --> 01:03:56.569]  About 50 teachers at a New Jersey school experienced a terrifying moment, and I've got these all over the country because I've interviewed the teachers, when a shooting rampage turned out to be a drill, but the teachers didn't know it.
[01:03:58.336 --> 01:03:59.036]  This is September 17, 2007.
[01:04:01.098 --> 01:04:03.619]  Do a similar headline to that, but do Minnesota.
[01:04:03.659 --> 01:04:06.261]  That was the really, where they put guns to their heads that were going to kill you.
[01:04:07.141 --> 01:04:11.324]  A man burst into a library and started shooting, but the gun didn't have any bullets, just blanks.
[01:04:11.344 --> 01:04:14.846]  The teachers took cover and hid children under tables.
[01:04:15.626 --> 01:04:16.486]  Crying and trembling.
[01:04:16.866 --> 01:04:17.607]  People are crying.
[01:04:17.627 --> 01:04:19.647]  The girl next to me is trembling and shaking.
[01:04:20.227 --> 01:04:21.228]  You heard people crying.
[01:04:21.268 --> 01:04:22.328]  You heard other people praying.
[01:04:22.748 --> 01:04:23.988]  It was pretty dramatic.
[01:04:24.008 --> 01:04:25.269]  You ought to have been fighting.
[01:04:25.909 --> 01:04:29.910]  One teacher said, the school district put the drill in place to test staff readiness.
[01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:35.192]  The Philipsburg school board heard from angry teachers and parents Monday night.
[01:04:35.252 --> 01:04:36.332]  The board is reviewing the drill.
[01:04:36.352 --> 01:04:38.353]  I mean, you just get literally thousands of these.
[01:04:38.373 --> 01:04:39.033]  Literally thousands.
[01:04:39.929 --> 01:04:46.375]  Then I got them where they make them stay in the classrooms without food during the drills and they defecate and urinate in trash cans.
[01:04:47.056 --> 01:04:47.496]  Stay with us.
[01:04:50.018 --> 01:04:52.601]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:04:53.231 --> 01:04:56.213]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:04:56.573 --> 01:04:59.994]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:06.538]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:05:06.938 --> 01:05:11.980]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[01:05:12.161 --> 01:05:18.864]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[01:05:19.184 --> 01:05:20.045]  Need something more?
[01:05:20.266 --> 01:05:23.910]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:32.282]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.
[01:05:32.522 --> 01:05:36.868]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off of your order and a free self-defense keychain.
[01:05:37.128 --> 01:05:40.731]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:05:40.791 --> 01:05:44.635]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:06:03.886 --> 01:06:10.093]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:10.413 --> 01:06:12.315]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:12.455 --> 01:06:14.877]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:25.909]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:26.511 --> 01:06:27.811]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:28.191 --> 01:06:29.552]  It's about a one world government.
[01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:36.393]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:06:45.215 --> 01:06:46.376]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:46.796 --> 01:06:47.996]  The people strike back.
[01:06:49.767 --> 01:06:53.608]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[01:06:53.768 --> 01:06:57.270]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.
[01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:01.331]  You may think I'm crazy, but I know my identity is safe.
[01:07:01.511 --> 01:07:05.793]  At LifeLock, every member is covered by our $1 million total service guarantee.
[01:07:06.613 --> 01:07:07.233]  We're good to go.
[01:07:33.226 --> 01:07:33.586]  We're good.
[01:07:54.497 --> 01:07:58.660]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:00.142]  You want answers?
[01:08:00.922 --> 01:08:01.803]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:02.463 --> 01:08:06.126]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:06.667 --> 01:08:10.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:14.993]  Well, I've been on his show quite a bit in the last four years.
[01:08:16.194 --> 01:08:20.618]  He's Alan Combs, a TV commentator on Fox Television.
[01:08:22.074 --> 01:08:27.242]  And of course he has a syndicated radio show via Fox, and that's the show that I've been on quite a few times.
[01:08:27.302 --> 01:08:34.873]  Lord Hannity would never have me on, but he would have me on when I was busy bashing Bush, but would also, you know, criticize him quite a bit.
[01:08:34.893 --> 01:08:37.036]  You know, we've had some nice sparring and debates.
[01:08:37.597 --> 01:08:43.380]  And then he's still having me on now that Lord Obama, continuing all the exact same policies, is in power.
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:52.204]  So we have the great Alan Combs on with us, and I'll get back into the re-education camps that they've turned the public schools into when he leaves us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:52.464 --> 01:08:54.165]  Mr. Combs, it's good to have you here with us.
[01:08:54.225 --> 01:08:55.086]  Thank you for acknowledging, Alex.
[01:08:55.126 --> 01:08:57.387]  I don't just put you on when it favors my side.
[01:08:58.888 --> 01:08:59.968]  No, that's what I was acknowledging.
[01:08:59.988 --> 01:09:01.489]  Thank you for acknowledging that.
[01:09:02.455 --> 01:09:03.656]  Yeah, absolutely, Alan.
[01:09:03.676 --> 01:09:07.259]  We don't play the whole left-right paradigm ourselves.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.083]  And I think the country's starting to get away from these labels, or at least trying to.
[01:09:12.103 --> 01:09:14.645]  Well, I think much of you might be critical of Obama.
[01:09:14.745 --> 01:09:24.773]  I believe his tone and the fact that he's got a bipartisan cabinet goes a long way toward back-healing those wounds and having us live in a post-partisan America to some extent.
[01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:26.515]  Minus the teabaggers.
[01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:30.672]  You know, that was one of the questions I wanted to ask you.
[01:09:30.772 --> 01:09:41.799]  I mean, that is really a derogatory term, though, to have CNN doing it, MSNBC doing it, a sexual derogatory term.
[01:09:41.819 --> 01:09:44.481]  If there was any question, they admit it's a sexual term.
[01:09:44.761 --> 01:09:46.262]  I thought that's what they were calling themselves.
[01:09:47.083 --> 01:09:53.927]  And then to say they're all, I'm not saying you're doing this, I'm asking what you think, that they're all racist and they all hate black people.
[01:09:53.947 --> 01:09:54.668]  Do you believe that, Alan?
[01:09:54.688 --> 01:09:55.588]  No, no, no.
[01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:56.389]  That's not my take.
[01:09:56.809 --> 01:09:57.830]  I keep getting accused
[01:09:58.383 --> 01:09:59.664]  of saying they're all racist.
[01:09:59.704 --> 01:10:00.764]  I've never said anything of the kind.
[01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:08.987]  I don't think the people, the fact that people hate Obama, some of them hate him or don't like him or criticize him because of the race issue, there is some of that.
[01:10:09.967 --> 01:10:16.050]  But I'm not blaming the tea bag people, whatever you want to call them, for being racist.
[01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:16.770]  Some of them are.
[01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:20.651]  Some of them, most of them were very peaceful and well behaved.
[01:10:21.151 --> 01:10:22.792]  I just think my problem with that is
[01:10:23.434 --> 01:10:25.036]  It was disingenuous what it was.
[01:10:25.357 --> 01:10:39.496]  It was corporately sponsored to say that somehow this was a grassroots movement, to say it was bipartisan, and it wasn't about being against Obama when clearly it was a criticism of democratic policies to say that anything else is disingenuous.
[01:10:39.795 --> 01:10:52.378]  Yeah, but clearly, Alan, your employer tried to hijack Fox and others and talk radio, Neocon Talk Radio, tried to take it over and did to a certain extent, but I was there.
[01:10:52.438 --> 01:10:59.479]  We had Ron Paul tea parties here in Austin last October and they had them in D.C.
[01:10:59.499 --> 01:11:01.179]  and Boston and San Diego.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:07.601]  We started the tea parties and then along came Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh.
[01:11:09.864 --> 01:11:15.429]  They tried to make this a Republican versus Democratic thing, but then claimed it was bipartisan.
[01:11:16.049 --> 01:11:21.374]  This had nothing to do with parties, but it certainly was, at least what it became, was not what you originally started.
[01:11:21.774 --> 01:11:31.763]  What it evolved into was, let's bash Obama, let's bash the Democrats, but we're going to claim it's grassroots and we're going to claim that it's bipartisan, none of which it was, at least in terms of the recent
[01:11:32.426 --> 01:11:34.667]  April 15th, so-called Tea Party.
[01:11:34.687 --> 01:11:36.868]  Look, people forget, too, naming it the Tea Party.
[01:11:36.908 --> 01:11:39.989]  The original Tea Party was about taxation without representation.
[01:11:40.589 --> 01:11:42.190]  This is representation.
[01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:43.610]  They just lost an election.
[01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:44.511]  That's what that was about.
[01:11:46.191 --> 01:11:54.454]  Well, I mean, Alan, it is bipartisan that 98% of Americans in a Gallup poll, and they were saying that they were getting 1,001 phone calls in Congress against the banker bailout.
[01:11:55.315 --> 01:11:57.835]  I mean, that is bipartisan that folks don't like what's happening.
[01:11:57.855 --> 01:11:58.736]  I'm talking about the Tea Parties.
[01:11:58.876 --> 01:12:01.777]  I'm talking about the fact that the Tea Party was basically organized
[01:12:02.082 --> 01:12:16.391]  By three conservative groups, groups like Dick Armey's group, Newt Gingrich was involved in it, to say that this was a bipartisan effort, I'm talking about specifically what happened on April 15th, was not bipartisan, was not grassroots.
[01:12:16.831 --> 01:12:24.255]  Well, my issue is, when I see people like Janine Garofalo get up and say everyone is a racist, that is racism.
[01:12:24.496 --> 01:12:27.017]  That is injecting racism.
[01:12:27.617 --> 01:12:28.658]  Go ahead.
[01:12:28.818 --> 01:12:30.219]  Sorry Alex, here's my problem.
[01:12:30.732 --> 01:12:32.634]  I don't agree with what Janine Garofalo said.
[01:12:33.195 --> 01:12:41.523]  My problem is those who don't agree with me, who will hold up comments like that and say, see you liberals, this is the way you liberals are.
[01:12:41.843 --> 01:12:45.367]  Just like Alexander, you get lumped in with people you may not want to be lumped in with.
[01:12:45.727 --> 01:12:51.833]  But every time some left-wing wacko says something or does something stupid, it becomes this is how the right will define the left.
[01:12:52.194 --> 01:12:53.515]  And that shouldn't happen anymore.
[01:12:53.979 --> 01:12:57.121]  than people who are members of the Klan, to define the right, for example.
[01:12:57.141 --> 01:13:04.524]  But I wasn't trying to lump you in, I... In fact, you... But listen, I figured that you were gonna not like what she said, because I think I know you pretty well.
[01:13:04.825 --> 01:13:04.985]  Right.
[01:13:05.025 --> 01:13:06.125]  But it's the same thing.
[01:13:06.505 --> 01:13:18.472]  Some guy visits my website out of hundreds, shoots three cops, and then the Southern Poverty Law Center associates me with him, and it comes out later, what he was doing on my site was attacking me.
[01:13:18.672 --> 01:13:20.012]  Now that's really not fair.
[01:13:20.112 --> 01:13:22.874]  Look, as I said to you, uh, the other day when you did my show,
[01:13:23.414 --> 01:13:27.937]  I was followed around New York by 9-11 truthers, many of whom do things in your name.
[01:13:28.397 --> 01:13:29.798]  I was harassed by these people.
[01:13:30.158 --> 01:13:33.820]  I know that many of them are followers, or at least listeners and supporters of you.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.642]  I don't hold you personally accountable for their behavior.
[01:13:38.983 --> 01:13:44.446]  Well, I appreciate that, and I'm glad that... I mean, that's overall just another issue.
[01:13:44.466 --> 01:13:45.887]  I don't want to sidetrack completely on that.
[01:13:45.907 --> 01:13:47.888]  I just wanted to ask you about it, because you brought up the team parties.
[01:13:49.726 --> 01:13:52.127]  The media keeps saying tea-bagging so much, I almost just said it.
[01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:56.249]  Alan, what do you really think of Obama?
[01:13:56.309 --> 01:13:58.450]  I mean, hasn't he gone back on a lot of his promises?
[01:13:58.810 --> 01:13:59.030]  No.
[01:14:00.451 --> 01:14:01.011]  No, he's not.
[01:14:02.572 --> 01:14:05.573]  We all know that governing and running for office are two different things.
[01:14:05.693 --> 01:14:08.835]  I don't see him as somebody who went back on a lot of his promises.
[01:14:09.275 --> 01:14:12.056]  He said we get out of Iraq in 16 months in terms of
[01:14:12.703 --> 01:14:14.224]  Uh, you know, combat troops.
[01:14:14.564 --> 01:14:21.389]  Okay, it's gonna be, what, a few more months because he compromised with the generals on the ground, listening to generals on the ground.
[01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:25.913]  Um, he said he's gonna lower taxes for 95% of tax-paying Americans.
[01:14:26.433 --> 01:14:27.554]  That seems to be in play.
[01:14:28.014 --> 01:14:30.376]  Uh, he said he'd have a bipartisan cabinet.
[01:14:30.636 --> 01:14:32.097]  He's got railroad, transportation.
[01:14:32.117 --> 01:14:34.159]  He kept Great Gates in, uh, defense.
[01:14:34.199 --> 01:14:37.261]  He tried to give Judd Gregg, uh, Judd Gregg Punkton.
[01:14:37.301 --> 01:14:38.882]  He tried to give Gregg, uh, a position.
[01:14:39.492 --> 01:14:40.953]  Uh, I think he's done a very good thing.
[01:14:40.993 --> 01:14:41.874]  He changed the tone.
[01:14:42.154 --> 01:14:43.075]  He talked to our enemies.
[01:14:43.475 --> 01:14:45.016]  He's doing a lot of the things he said he would do.
[01:14:45.036 --> 01:14:46.477]  And he's doing a lot.
[01:14:46.657 --> 01:14:49.459]  Have you got Republicans saying, oh my God, he's doing too much?
[01:14:50.139 --> 01:14:57.084]  And yet, when Bush tried to do things besides prosecute the war on terror, we were told, of course, we could walk and chew gum at the same time.
[01:14:57.384 --> 01:14:59.265]  Okay, what about lobbyists?
[01:14:59.285 --> 01:15:00.987]  He said, I will not hire lobbyists.
[01:15:01.047 --> 01:15:04.009]  And boy, this is uber, uber lobbyists.
[01:15:04.329 --> 01:15:04.709]  You can't.
[01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:06.650]  Yeah, that's a tough one.
[01:15:06.690 --> 01:15:07.591]  You know, you can't.
[01:15:08.334 --> 01:15:12.499]  Not hire lobbyists because everybody, uh, everybody's a lobbyist.
[01:15:12.579 --> 01:15:20.687]  I mean, not everybody, but everybody, among those who will apply for jobs in an administration, there are always going to be those who work as lobbyists.
[01:15:21.048 --> 01:15:23.190]  You know, John McCain said he wouldn't have any lobbyists in his
[01:15:23.638 --> 01:15:26.099]  His campaign was run by lobbyists.
[01:15:26.179 --> 01:15:27.279]  Well, they shouldn't lie!
[01:15:27.319 --> 01:15:28.159]  That's my point!
[01:15:28.319 --> 01:15:31.520]  I'm not defending Obama on that, I'm simply saying... But I mean, why do they lie then?
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.180]  Why is it just... I mean, you even just said it.
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:36.661]  Oh, well, there's rhetoric in a campaign, Alex, and then there's governing.
[01:15:37.161 --> 01:15:38.482]  I mean, why lie then?
[01:15:38.542 --> 01:15:40.502]  I mean, I will not hire one lobbyist.
[01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:43.703]  Well, you could say... I don't know if they ever said, I'll not hire one lobbyist.
[01:15:44.263 --> 01:15:46.244]  But I think it's like anything else.
[01:15:46.304 --> 01:15:49.585]  If you were to run for office, you would say a bunch of things, and then you get into office.
[01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:50.765]  Okay, here's the way it really is.
[01:15:51.212 --> 01:15:52.834]  I don't think it's a calculated lie.
[01:15:52.854 --> 01:15:54.756]  Do you want to get him on that?
[01:15:54.836 --> 01:15:55.697]  Okay, I'll give you that.
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:59.242]  In general though, has he done a good job?
[01:15:59.262 --> 01:16:02.545]  Has he done pretty much what he said he was going to do?
[01:16:02.826 --> 01:16:04.408]  Has he changed the tone in DC?
[01:16:04.728 --> 01:16:06.370]  Has he tried to reach out to all sides?
[01:16:07.111 --> 01:16:08.412]  Is he talking to other countries?
[01:16:08.633 --> 01:16:09.814]  Is he getting us out of Iraq?
[01:16:10.114 --> 01:16:11.376]  Is he dealing with the economy?
[01:16:11.755 --> 01:16:15.336]  These are all things that are more important than the few things you can probably talk about.
[01:16:15.356 --> 01:16:18.297]  Okay, let's talk about the war, because we got an argument about this.
[01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:19.918]  I have video clips of him.
[01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:21.178]  It's in the Obama Deception.
[01:16:21.699 --> 01:16:23.679]  Free online, folks, the obamadeception.net.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:28.701]  He says in there, I will start bringing our troops home immediately the first day.
[01:16:29.081 --> 01:16:30.702]  Then he says 16, then 23.
[01:16:30.762 --> 01:16:34.723]  Now the generals are saying, oh wait, we may not even want to pull down to 50,000 permanently.
[01:16:36.204 --> 01:16:37.967]  Uh, for six more months after that.
[01:16:38.007 --> 01:16:39.549]  So now we're out well past two years.
[01:16:39.569 --> 01:16:40.731]  I'm aware that the plan is 23.
[01:16:41.272 --> 01:16:44.557]  I'm also aware that during the campaign I heard him say over and over again 16.
[01:16:44.717 --> 01:16:47.402]  I never heard him say we'll get it out the first day.
[01:16:47.816 --> 01:16:53.960]  He campaigned on, once his campaign was up and running, a 16 month timeline with two to three brigades a month.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.180]  That's what he campaigned on.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.202]  Early on, he said immediately.
[01:16:57.542 --> 01:17:04.686]  Then once he started to get steam, he did moderate to 16, then 23, and now they're saying even longer and we'll see.
[01:17:04.706 --> 01:17:12.691]  He also said, he would listen to the troops on the ground, listen to the generals on the ground, which is exactly what he's doing, which you've got to do if you want to have some credibility.
[01:17:13.011 --> 01:17:14.672]  You don't make the decision from the Rose Guard.
[01:17:14.972 --> 01:17:16.193]  Okay, let's take taxes.
[01:17:18.375 --> 01:17:25.981]  He's saying he's going to rewrite the tax code and get rid of some of the exemptions on property tax or on interest on the mortgage.
[01:17:26.001 --> 01:17:26.742]  That is a big one.
[01:17:27.082 --> 01:17:29.023]  For those of us that pay taxes and own houses, we know.
[01:17:29.464 --> 01:17:30.404]  I'm sure you know, Alan.
[01:17:31.025 --> 01:17:34.408]  He's talking about these green taxes, these carbon taxes.
[01:17:34.528 --> 01:17:38.891]  Those are taxes that are people under $125,000 individually a year.
[01:17:39.972 --> 01:17:43.515]  Well, when he was talking about income taxes, he was talking about the tax rate.
[01:17:43.999 --> 01:17:44.179]  Is it?
[01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:03.231]  Many of the states are raising taxes because they need to make up the shortfall.
[01:18:03.331 --> 01:18:04.991]  And there was the George H.W.
[01:18:05.211 --> 01:18:06.911]  There was the George H.W.
[01:18:07.191 --> 01:18:08.371]  retroactive taxes.
[01:18:08.391 --> 01:18:12.112]  I mean, look, I agree the Republicans are a bunch of tax and spenders as well.
[01:18:12.332 --> 01:18:16.473]  I mean, I'm not saying, but I don't know, Alan.
[01:18:17.473 --> 01:18:20.634]  What about him saying no rights for detainees?
[01:18:21.094 --> 01:18:25.094]  What about him saying, I'm going to say you followed orders, Nuremberg doesn't matter.
[01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:29.035]  You don't need to detain any CIA agents who are carrying out orders.
[01:18:29.725 --> 01:18:32.767]  He wants rights for detainees, they have a right to habeas corpus.
[01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:41.712]  Something that was denied under the Bush administration, I do have a problem with, and I would like to see him prosecute even those who are just following orders.
[01:18:41.732 --> 01:18:55.159]  They know what the rules are, they know what the laws are, they should at least go after those lawyers like Bybee and you, who, Bradford, you know, the people who were obviously telling Bush and Cheney what they wanted to hear, who wrote the so-called torture memos.
[01:18:55.835 --> 01:19:20.194]  Uh, you know, the New York Times, I'm sure you and your audience love the New York Times, but the truth is that, you know, they had a piece two days ago that if you did, if they did any background and looked at historically where these torture techniques, including waterboarding, came from, they go back to the Spanish Inquisition and we prosecuted people after World War II for waterboarding and the same kinds, I mean, we went after people for being war criminals for the very kinds of things we're now doing.
[01:19:20.515 --> 01:19:24.578]  Yeah, they executed Japanese soldiers for it.
[01:19:25.823 --> 01:19:31.330]  And then, they really learned it in the modern times from North Korea, from the Korean War, from what I've read.
[01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:33.693]  But you're right, it goes back to the Spanish Inquisition.
[01:19:34.674 --> 01:19:35.955]  Give us your website, Alan.
[01:19:36.396 --> 01:19:37.077]  Alan.com.
[01:19:38.018 --> 01:19:38.658]  Alan.com.
[01:19:38.678 --> 01:19:39.359]  You can't beat that.
[01:19:39.399 --> 01:19:39.880]  That's easy.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.621]  Alan.com.
[01:19:40.921 --> 01:19:41.902]  I wish I had one that good.
[01:19:42.183 --> 01:19:42.823]  Stay there, my friend.
[01:19:42.843 --> 01:19:43.424]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:43.464 --> 01:19:44.345]  Final segment with Alan.
[01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:45.527]  Come, straight ahead.
[01:19:49.875 --> 01:19:54.139]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:19:54.399 --> 01:19:59.303]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:00.824]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:20:01.004 --> 01:20:04.487]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[01:20:04.607 --> 01:20:09.771]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[01:20:10.031 --> 01:20:15.796]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[01:20:16.116 --> 01:20:18.517]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[01:20:18.617 --> 01:20:20.937]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[01:20:21.157 --> 01:20:23.278]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[01:20:23.578 --> 01:20:24.558]  No harsh chemicals.
[01:20:24.778 --> 01:20:25.719]  No animal testing.
[01:20:25.979 --> 01:20:27.279]  I use them and love them.
[01:20:27.299 --> 01:20:28.899]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.240]  And I say big time.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.820]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:32.080]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.761]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:48.607]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:20:50.188 --> 01:20:55.411]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:20:56.210 --> 01:21:01.552]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:02.093 --> 01:21:08.275]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:08.575 --> 01:21:10.396]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:10.556 --> 01:21:12.937]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:21:13.017 --> 01:21:23.902]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:26.187 --> 01:21:27.448]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:27.868 --> 01:21:29.289]  It's about a one world government.
[01:21:29.729 --> 01:21:36.052]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:21:36.632 --> 01:21:44.416]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:44.896 --> 01:21:46.057]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:46.477 --> 01:21:47.638]  The people strike back.
[01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:52.727]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[01:21:53.107 --> 01:21:59.689]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:04.410]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:14.493]  Call me at 800-686-2237, extension 115, and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[01:22:14.932 --> 01:22:24.655]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years, compared to our present fiat currency, which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[01:22:24.995 --> 01:22:32.358]  Call me, Dwayne Dalley, at 800-686-2237, extension 115, to start your protection of wealth today.
[01:22:32.378 --> 01:22:35.839]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[01:22:36.339 --> 01:22:38.560]  No amount is too small, so start today.
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:47.846]  Call Duane Daly with Midas resources at 800-686-2237 extension 115 for your gold and silver protection portfolio.
[01:22:50.388 --> 01:22:51.249]  You are a rebel.
[01:22:51.549 --> 01:22:51.949]  Admit it.
[01:22:52.290 --> 01:22:55.072]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[01:22:55.272 --> 01:22:57.333]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[01:22:57.654 --> 01:23:01.356]  Once in a while you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[01:23:01.596 --> 01:23:05.259]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot and you can count your real friends on
[01:23:05.399 --> 01:23:05.759]  I think?
[01:23:40.916 --> 01:23:41.156]  We're good.
[01:23:58.151 --> 01:24:00.814]  We've only got five minutes left with Alan Cohn, but he's agreed to come back.
[01:24:00.974 --> 01:24:10.325]  Uh, Alan, during the break we Googled together, San Jose Mercury News, Washington Post, Obama backs Bush, no rights for Bagram prisoners, no Geneva Convention, no habeas corpus.
[01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:11.486]  So, there you go!
[01:24:11.506 --> 01:24:13.889]  Do you agree with Obama on, uh, that?
[01:24:16.232 --> 01:24:16.472]  Alan?
[01:24:17.934 --> 01:24:19.035]  So you don't agree with him on that?
[01:24:29.991 --> 01:24:34.374]  You are very good, Alex, at pulling out those particular instances where I don't agree with him.
[01:24:34.755 --> 01:24:37.977]  Does that mean I still think he's doing a great job as president?
[01:24:37.997 --> 01:24:40.419]  There are going to be those areas where I disagree.
[01:24:40.979 --> 01:24:41.840]  You went after Bush.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.801]  You went after Obama.
[01:24:43.061 --> 01:24:44.762]  You'll go after whoever's in office, probably.
[01:24:45.223 --> 01:24:51.207]  But, generally speaking, we have transparency in this administration like we did not have before.
[01:24:51.227 --> 01:24:54.690]  What I find amazing, here you have Obama releasing the torture memos.
[01:24:55.157 --> 01:24:59.641]  Cheney comes forward now and he says, let's release the stuff that shows the torture works.
[01:24:59.941 --> 01:25:04.345]  So all of a sudden you've got Cheney calling for transparency when he's been quiet.
[01:25:04.425 --> 01:25:07.468]  This is not the most transparent vice president we've ever had.
[01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:10.731]  And now suddenly the Obama's president wants transparency.
[01:25:11.332 --> 01:25:13.774]  No, I'm saying it was bad when Bush was doing it.
[01:25:13.814 --> 01:25:15.375]  It's bad now when Obama's doing it.
[01:25:15.455 --> 01:25:17.738]  You know, it was a lot worse when Bush was doing it.
[01:25:17.878 --> 01:25:20.060]  At least with Obama you have transparency.
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.341]  He's changing the tone.
[01:25:21.724 --> 01:25:23.005]  He's doing most of the things right.
[01:25:23.305 --> 01:25:30.090]  I don't agree with him on not going after the CIA people, and I don't agree with him not giving detainees certain rights.
[01:25:30.490 --> 01:25:32.571]  Human rights attorneys also seem to agree with me on this.
[01:25:33.032 --> 01:25:33.972]  I'm a human rights guy.
[01:25:34.052 --> 01:25:34.573]  I don't like it.
[01:25:36.054 --> 01:25:40.857]  You know, again, but on balance, he's much better at this stuff than the last administration.
[01:25:41.117 --> 01:25:45.360]  Okay, Alan, in the time we've got left, I've got two final questions for you, and I really want you to answer these.
[01:25:46.815 --> 01:25:52.701]  I heard an audio clip online of you saying more power to the Bilderberg Group, but we've gotten some of their minutes.
[01:25:52.761 --> 01:25:54.923]  They've admitted they helped covertly set up the EU.
[01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:55.644]  I was kidding.
[01:25:55.704 --> 01:25:57.266]  It was a sarcastic remark.
[01:25:57.526 --> 01:26:07.977]  No, but do you remember ten years ago when the media said Bilderberg Group didn't exist, and now... Okay, so you were kidding about that, but... I said more power to them, like, you know, fine, leave me alone about it.
[01:26:08.536 --> 01:26:09.097]  I understand now.
[01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:20.786]  What about hundreds of mainstream news articles saying, New World Order, and then defining it, a bank of the world that we pay carbon taxes to, that controls the world's interest rates and currency values?
[01:26:20.906 --> 01:26:26.530]  Look, Alex, I know that you are... I know you believe conspiracy theorists will take over the world.
[01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:31.134]  I know you think that all these groups are all leading toward one world government.
[01:26:31.754 --> 01:26:33.936]  I don't think our sovereignty is in jeopardy, as you might.
[01:26:34.717 --> 01:26:36.798]  I'm not terribly interested in the Bilderbergs.
[01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:37.659]  I'm not worried about them.
[01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:39.583]  It doesn't really interest me.
[01:26:39.603 --> 01:26:46.051]  I know we get calls about this all the time, but to me this is not a true threat to our sovereignty or democracy.
[01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:50.257]  Well, Alan, I was joking with you in the break saying you're worried the conspiracy theorists will take over the world.
[01:26:50.277 --> 01:26:54.120]  My whole point is, reality is going to win the day and tyranny is going to fail.
[01:26:54.481 --> 01:26:56.582]  The world is moving towards a lot of tyranny.
[01:26:56.602 --> 01:27:01.866]  I mean, wouldn't you say the world is in a trend towards tyranny and big government?
[01:27:01.887 --> 01:27:05.449]  No, I think, especially with Obama as the leader of the free world, we're headed in the opposite direction.
[01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:12.275]  I think when we had the last administration that believed in preemptive war, that believed in violating the Constitution to the extent that it did,
[01:27:12.697 --> 01:27:14.522]  That did not believe in habeas corpus.
[01:27:14.863 --> 01:27:19.474]  I believe during that administration we were much more in the direction of tyranny than we are now.
[01:27:19.864 --> 01:27:23.206]  Okay, but Alan, certainly out in the open it was much worse.
[01:27:24.067 --> 01:27:35.614]  Now, because he's got a pretty face on it, and well-spoken, and does a few things like releasing a few of the memos, but then says, I agree with it, that it's going to get worse because he's... No, I don't agree with that.
[01:27:36.135 --> 01:27:37.896]  Okay, fine, you don't agree with that, but here's the issue.
[01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:46.161]  Are they not announcing a new world order all over the news and saying it's exactly what we said it was, a private group of banks ruling the planet?
[01:27:46.622 --> 01:27:46.702]  No.
[01:27:48.004 --> 01:27:48.606]  I don't think that.
[01:27:48.626 --> 01:27:56.345]  I mean, you believe there's this underbelly that really runs everything and the bill they're going to take over and we're moving toward one world government as I'm going to...
[01:27:56.678 --> 01:27:57.598]  I'm repeating myself.
[01:27:57.979 --> 01:28:01.460]  I am more sanguine about our ability to maintain our sovereignty.
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.581]  That stuff doesn't threaten me like it does you.
[01:28:04.741 --> 01:28:05.942]  There's an overbelly.
[01:28:05.982 --> 01:28:07.222]  This is not an underbelly.
[01:28:08.623 --> 01:28:10.223]  I mean, this is the head here.
[01:28:10.303 --> 01:28:13.604]  This is not the belly with ticks crawling along it.
[01:28:14.265 --> 01:28:16.726]  I don't have the fear that you do that this is what's going to happen.
[01:28:17.006 --> 01:28:17.446]  Wait a minute.
[01:28:17.566 --> 01:28:25.309]  I mean, you're saying that they're not announcing, you know, Times of London, Financial Times of London headline, and now for world government.
[01:28:26.232 --> 01:28:29.633]  I think there are people who would, probably some people who would like it.
[01:28:29.653 --> 01:28:31.754]  There are people like you who probably fear it.
[01:28:32.114 --> 01:28:33.575]  I don't think it's a realistic fear.
[01:28:34.395 --> 01:28:36.336]  Do you think global government would be a good thing?
[01:28:36.876 --> 01:28:37.036]  No.
[01:28:38.717 --> 01:28:38.897]  No.
[01:28:39.417 --> 01:28:44.219]  I think it would be great to have a better relationship with even our enemies, but that doesn't mean global government.
[01:28:44.559 --> 01:28:52.602]  I like the fact that Obama is reaching out to our perceived enemies and actually touching them by shaking their hands and accepting their books and saying we should
[01:28:52.987 --> 01:28:57.790]  You know, hopefully next we'll release, you know, or take it away with the embargo in Cuba.
[01:28:58.410 --> 01:29:01.972]  I think those are all very good moves, but they don't mean one world government.
[01:29:02.272 --> 01:29:07.235]  Alan, alan.com, and you're on the radio weeknights, what, what is it, nine to midnight?
[01:29:08.533 --> 01:29:08.753]  When?
[01:29:09.493 --> 01:29:10.894]  10 to 1 Eastern Time.
[01:29:11.034 --> 01:29:12.794]  Yeah, 10 to 1 Eastern, 9 to Midnight Central.
[01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:19.495]  Hey, Obama did vote for basically total gun bans in the Senate when he was at the state in Illinois.
[01:29:19.515 --> 01:29:20.796]  He is not banning guns.
[01:29:20.836 --> 01:29:22.296]  He's not taking away your ammunition.
[01:29:22.336 --> 01:29:23.136]  Your guns are safe.
[01:29:23.156 --> 01:29:23.696]  Your ammunition is safe.
[01:29:23.716 --> 01:29:24.936]  You don't have to go out and buy the next gun.
[01:29:24.976 --> 01:29:26.537]  His Attorney General argued for the D.C.
[01:29:26.557 --> 01:29:27.757]  You're going to be fine.
[01:29:27.777 --> 01:29:28.817]  Will I be fine under the D.C.
[01:29:28.897 --> 01:29:29.157]  gun ban?
[01:29:29.177 --> 01:29:31.618]  It's not even a priority in this administration right now.
[01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:33.798]  Will I be fine under the D.C.
[01:29:33.818 --> 01:29:34.158]  gun ban?
[01:29:34.178 --> 01:29:35.099]  Will I be fine under that?
[01:29:35.139 --> 01:29:35.519]  Yes.
[01:29:35.559 --> 01:29:36.719]  In fact, the less guns, the better.
[01:29:37.574 --> 01:29:38.735]  So you support that, Alan?
[01:29:38.755 --> 01:29:39.555]  You're something else.
[01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:40.836]  We're on the march.
[01:29:41.317 --> 01:29:42.918]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:43.838 --> 01:29:46.620]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:49.862 --> 01:29:51.123]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:29:51.163 --> 01:29:56.527]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:29:56.767 --> 01:30:01.390]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:02.171]  It's true.
[01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:04.833]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:30:05.073 --> 01:30:06.814]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:30:07.341 --> 01:30:12.022]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:12.562 --> 01:30:14.483]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:30:14.863 --> 01:30:19.464]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:20.584]  And here's the best part.
[01:30:20.784 --> 01:30:23.565]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:30:23.865 --> 01:30:27.166]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:27.486 --> 01:30:30.326]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:30:30.667 --> 01:30:32.567]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:30:32.887 --> 01:30:33.807]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:30:37.469 --> 01:30:38.129]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:38.890 --> 01:30:46.194]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:46.514 --> 01:30:48.896]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:30:50.134 --> 01:30:55.438]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:30:55.938 --> 01:31:02.924]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:09.689]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:11.930]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:14.492]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:14.572 --> 01:31:25.540]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.441]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:27.841 --> 01:31:29.202]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:29.683 --> 01:31:35.927]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:36.596 --> 01:31:44.346]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:46.008]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:46.428 --> 01:31:47.630]  The people strike back!
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:54.805]  With an economy that continues to plummet, many of us will have to make the difficult decision to cut back on our expenses.
[01:31:55.426 --> 01:31:58.108]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[01:31:58.548 --> 01:32:05.855]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, a weak immune system, or just always feel tired, you need to visit Shentrition.com.
[01:32:06.316 --> 01:32:10.840]  The philosophy at Shentrition is to feed the body what it needs, plus heal the body with food.
[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:11.881]  I think so.
[01:32:28.336 --> 01:32:28.616]  I think so.
[01:33:01.164 --> 01:33:02.584]  Is it getting better?
[01:33:05.005 --> 01:33:07.125]  Hey, I got some really great news for all the listeners.
[01:33:07.185 --> 01:33:13.187]  I finally, after a year, convinced the network that they're getting their phone system when a processing unit goes out.
[01:33:13.247 --> 01:33:15.547]  We know it overdrives hot callers.
[01:33:16.868 --> 01:33:18.788]  Hallelujah, they say they're going to replace it.
[01:33:18.808 --> 01:33:21.709]  They finally... No, it's broken.
[01:33:22.269 --> 01:33:23.669]  This will be a day long remembered.
[01:33:28.297 --> 01:33:33.738]  G. Gordon Lenny used to go, I swear we're in here with former East German radio equipment.
[01:33:33.798 --> 01:33:34.638]  It's terrible.
[01:33:35.498 --> 01:33:37.359]  This place is unbelievable.
[01:33:37.639 --> 01:33:39.819]  East German radio equipment.
[01:33:40.419 --> 01:33:42.720]  I think we have the East German radio equipment up there.
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:44.640]  But John Harmon does a great job.
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.380]  You know, we got a pretty good studio down here.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:55.082]  Until they get it replaced, I'll just start taking calls and guests here on my lines, because it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse.
[01:33:56.161 --> 01:33:58.082]  Hey, but we're a small stand-alone network.
[01:33:58.102 --> 01:33:58.582]  We're growing.
[01:33:58.602 --> 01:33:59.623]  We're getting better all the time.
[01:33:59.643 --> 01:34:00.603]  We appreciate all of you.
[01:34:00.623 --> 01:34:06.746]  That's how we reach more people and spread the word is you spreading the word about the free podcast at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:06.786 --> 01:34:08.047]  The AM and FM stations we're on.
[01:34:08.467 --> 01:34:09.867]  A lot of new affiliates picking us up.
[01:34:09.887 --> 01:34:10.868]  I want to thank each and every one of them.
[01:34:10.908 --> 01:34:12.769]  Be sure and support those local sponsors.
[01:34:14.309 --> 01:34:15.430]  It's exciting what's going on.
[01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.790]  Okay.
[01:34:16.791 --> 01:34:20.352]  I want to take some calls from Todd and Scott and Frank and Casey and Jim.
[01:34:20.392 --> 01:34:21.033]  I know you've been holding.
[01:34:21.053 --> 01:34:21.773]  We're going to get to you.
[01:34:23.226 --> 01:34:31.674]  But, uh, let me just go over some of the background from these articles that I started covering before our interview with Alan Combs came up.
[01:34:33.496 --> 01:34:36.258]  Hey, did you hear Alan Combs say he's giving rights to the detainees?
[01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:41.372]  And then I came back from, uh, during the break, I said, oh, really, Alan, are you in front of a computer?
[01:34:41.392 --> 01:34:41.812]  He said, yeah.
[01:34:41.832 --> 01:34:46.174]  And I said, Google, Obama backs Bush, no rights for detainees.
[01:34:46.875 --> 01:34:55.599]  And he Googled it, and there was all the mainstream news with Obama's statement and his executive order that they would continue to secretly hold him with no habeas corpus, no Geneva Convention.
[01:34:56.059 --> 01:34:57.820]  And Alan had to say, oh, I disagree with that.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.742]  I mean, just, and we have the videos and his statements.
[01:35:03.762 --> 01:35:06.284]  He did say he'd bring the troops home immediately.
[01:35:06.344 --> 01:35:07.805]  He did 16 and 23 now.
[01:35:09.706 --> 01:35:11.167]  They're saying indefinitely.
[01:35:11.768 --> 01:35:12.448]  That's how it works.
[01:35:12.588 --> 01:35:13.148]  Oh yeah!
[01:35:14.129 --> 01:35:14.649]  Immediately.
[01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:14.990]  16, 23, 42, never.
[01:35:21.325 --> 01:35:23.386]  They're going to have parades, though, for returning brigades.
[01:35:23.406 --> 01:35:25.587]  You know, they send brigades over and bring brigades back.
[01:35:25.967 --> 01:35:26.547]  That's how they do it now.
[01:35:26.567 --> 01:35:27.448]  It's a total force.
[01:35:27.908 --> 01:35:29.209]  They don't just replace individuals.
[01:35:29.489 --> 01:35:30.109]  So, oh, look!
[01:35:30.129 --> 01:35:30.929]  The troops are marching!
[01:35:31.069 --> 01:35:31.490]  Oh, victory!
[01:35:31.530 --> 01:35:31.830]  Dun-dun-dun!
[01:35:31.870 --> 01:35:32.690]  Dun-dun-dun!
[01:35:32.710 --> 01:35:33.350]  Dun-dun-dun!
[01:35:33.370 --> 01:35:35.031]  They'll be like, Alex, the war is over!
[01:35:35.051 --> 01:35:35.772]  And I'm like, oh, really?
[01:35:36.012 --> 01:35:37.372]  More suicide bombings, more death.
[01:35:37.572 --> 01:35:38.733]  Oh, you're just a defeatist!
[01:35:42.935 --> 01:35:44.496]  There is no end to the lies, folks.
[01:35:44.556 --> 01:35:49.558]  See, under Obama, they'll just say the war is over, and that's the end of it.
[01:35:50.632 --> 01:35:56.918]  The war is over, it's all over, for the unknown soldier.
[01:35:58.299 --> 01:35:59.440]  It's all over for him.
[01:36:02.663 --> 01:36:04.405]  Okay, I told you about death education.
[01:36:04.445 --> 01:36:06.246]  Just a smattering of what's happening at the schools.
[01:36:06.286 --> 01:36:06.967]  We're on that daily.
[01:36:07.327 --> 01:36:09.249]  Death education at Columbine High.
[01:36:11.871 --> 01:36:16.776]  And it says that they admitted that they were given death education
[01:36:19.468 --> 01:36:22.630]  And they teach you how to die, how to hang yourself, how to kill yourself.
[01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:26.372]  A video was made of Tara's testimony distributed nationwide by Eagle Forum.
[01:36:26.673 --> 01:36:30.555]  The tape was aired on British television and the Atlantic Monthly did a feature story on it.
[01:36:30.875 --> 01:36:36.359]  The producers of 2020 saw the video and decided to do a segment on the death education that was aired in 1990 at Columbine.
[01:36:37.299 --> 01:36:40.101]  And in the video it teaches them how to die in coffins, how to kill themselves.
[01:36:43.363 --> 01:36:47.966]  And it just gets into the unbelievable, how the suicides just explode.
[01:36:49.266 --> 01:36:50.227]  So there you go.
[01:36:51.648 --> 01:36:52.369]  Here's another one.
[01:36:52.509 --> 01:36:55.732]  Armed men terrorize school unannounced.
[01:36:56.292 --> 01:36:57.033]  Here's another one.
[01:36:57.193 --> 01:36:59.195]  All over the country where they unannounced show up.
[01:36:59.715 --> 01:37:02.438]  WCAU TV and say we're going to kill you.
[01:37:02.878 --> 01:37:08.803]  We're terrorists and everybody freaks out and you know passes out from fear.
[01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:11.646]  I mean that is the most hardcore form of fear based mind control.
[01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:13.847]  I've got an AP article.
[01:37:15.057 --> 01:37:42.822]  out of Michigan where they came in and said we are the homeschool defense league and we're going to kill you and it just goes on and on on that front but again that's a demonized homeschoolers second amendment groups and to unannounced freak the kids out and terrorize them where they're scared of guns for the rest of their life that's how you kill the second amendment traumatize the children
[01:37:44.182 --> 01:37:49.570]  And it also sets the precedent to allow the police and military to do whatever they want, to get away with whatever they want.
[01:37:51.687 --> 01:37:54.609]  Classroom trash can used as toilet.
[01:37:55.109 --> 01:38:03.133]  A fifth grade teacher allowed five students, a boy and four girls, to use a trash can as a toilet during a school lockdown drill when no one was supposed to leave the classrooms.
[01:38:03.653 --> 01:38:07.455]  The Charleston County teacher, Phillip Fernando, was reprimanded.
[01:38:07.836 --> 01:38:09.556]  Should have just made him defecate on the ground, I guess.
[01:38:10.137 --> 01:38:16.120]  Last year for putting cardboard around a student's desk and keeping him isolated from his classmates for two hours from talking.
[01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:18.670]  Whatever that means.
[01:38:19.231 --> 01:38:24.553]  On Tuesday, Fernando gave the Charlestown Academy students permission to use the trashcan.
[01:38:24.973 --> 01:38:32.796]  When a girl used the bathroom, other girls held up jackets to shield the view while the students stood on the opposite with a wall with their backs turned.
[01:38:32.816 --> 01:38:36.818]  School district spokesman Jenny Adams said boys also did the same for the boy.
[01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:42.260]  It is not acceptable, Associate Superintendent Patricia Yandel told the newspaper.
[01:38:42.621 --> 01:38:45.462]  So, so, yeah, they were supposed to just urinate in their pants, I guess.
[01:38:46.701 --> 01:38:54.263]  During the drill, which lasted less than an hour, this is another article they found, I found one where they had to stay in the classroom all day with no lunches.
[01:38:55.783 --> 01:38:57.363]  But we tried to Google that and couldn't find it.
[01:38:57.763 --> 01:39:02.684]  During the drill, which lasted less than an hour, Fernando called the school's main office and said students needed to use the restroom.
[01:39:02.964 --> 01:39:09.185]  It was unclear what he was told, but Yandel said he was not told to leave students to use the trash can.
[01:39:10.046 --> 01:39:11.506]  So that was the lockdown drill.
[01:39:12.898 --> 01:39:14.278]  Here's another one, Washington Post.
[01:39:14.858 --> 01:39:16.859]  School boost preparations for attack.
[01:39:17.299 --> 01:39:21.000]  Many anti-terror plans would stop parents from picking up children.
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:25.681]  School administration in the Washington area yesterday stepped up preparations for possible terrorism.
[01:39:26.301 --> 01:39:32.663]  And most school districts told parents that they would be prevented or strongly discouraged from picking up their children in the event of a biological chemical attack.
[01:39:32.703 --> 01:39:35.563]  Now this was in 2003 they reported all this.
[01:39:35.804 --> 01:39:41.745]  We told people before 9-11 FEMA was doing drills of taking kids to FEMA camps and we confirmed that.
[01:39:42.145 --> 01:39:53.774]  In Fairfax County, Superintendent of Schools Daniel A. Dominey told the school board last night that he would deploy more security forces around schools, limit parking near buildings, and cancel outdoor activities for field trips.
[01:39:54.315 --> 01:39:57.457]  And the nation's terror alerts were raised to the highest level, code red.
[01:39:57.898 --> 01:39:59.779]  He said he would also consider closing schools.
[01:39:59.839 --> 01:40:01.200]  So it's just a martial law lockdown.
[01:40:01.441 --> 01:40:02.381]  They do those here in Austin.
[01:40:03.622 --> 01:40:06.625]  Four hours after they catch a bank robber, they'll still lock schools down.
[01:40:07.904 --> 01:40:16.406]  London County school officials yesterday added a shelter-in-place plan against chemical attacks and the usual emergency procedures and said parents are not allowed to get their children.
[01:40:16.906 --> 01:40:17.526]  So you got that.
[01:40:20.667 --> 01:40:22.307]  I saw you guys on screen.
[01:40:22.347 --> 01:40:25.928]  You found the AP article about Michigan telling them we're homeschoolers.
[01:40:27.588 --> 01:40:28.429]  I guess I'm going to find that.
[01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:29.829]  I think it's in the stack actually.
[01:40:33.815 --> 01:40:37.277]  State brainwashing children to re-educate their parents for green dictatorship.
[01:40:37.857 --> 01:40:50.402]  This is a Paul Watson article, PrisonPlanet.com, that goes through where Al Gore says your parents don't know what's really going on in the world, your parents are backwards, so you need to educate your parents about what's happening and basically report on them.
[01:40:52.623 --> 01:41:00.627]  High court UPI reports appeared ready to Tuesday to approve broad national authority to strip search students for drugs without warrants.
[01:41:01.971 --> 01:41:04.752]  Now here's an old one, 1999, March 26, 1999.
[01:41:07.792 --> 01:41:25.657]  This is in the archive now, the Pensacola News Journal, but you can find it at web.archive.org forward slash web 1999 or just Google Hobbs Middle School Marines and it's the first link comes up by Jenny LaCosta, News Journal staff writer.
[01:41:27.096 --> 01:41:28.017]  Now listen carefully.
[01:41:28.297 --> 01:41:37.525]  The sleepy atmosphere that precedes first period was broken at Hobbs Middle School on Thursday morning by a shound of Marines, Navy and Coast Guard pilots marching through the school halls.
[01:41:38.286 --> 01:41:47.374]  While sixth graders in Lynette Whitefield's geography class were watching CNN reports on NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
[01:41:47.734 --> 01:41:48.735]  Can we punch this article up?
[01:41:48.755 --> 01:41:48.975]  Thanks.
[01:41:49.798 --> 01:41:55.281]  They heard a voice bark over the intercom, military personnel, take your classrooms.
[01:41:55.921 --> 01:42:11.030]  The mock takeover of Hobbs Middle School by pilots and flight students from Whiting Field was a way to illustrate what martial law is all about, said Lieutenant Troy Bashears, a Coast Guard pilot assigned to Whiting Field Naval Air Station.
[01:42:11.991 --> 01:42:16.935]  And I told you, we did interviews with Marines who covertly were doing martial law takeover drills in the late 80s.
[01:42:17.315 --> 01:42:18.496]  This has been going on a long time.
[01:42:18.917 --> 01:42:23.661]  Now it appears to be building, well it doesn't appear it is, but it appears to be coming to a head.
[01:42:23.681 --> 01:42:30.667]  If you guys can't find it again, just Google, Hobbs Middle School Marines.
[01:42:32.298 --> 01:42:34.699]  But once the sailors and marines... Ah, good, you have it.
[01:42:35.139 --> 01:42:43.904]  But once the sailors and marines were in the classrooms, their mission was to teach for a day of subjects such as math, science, history and geography and give teachers a break.
[01:42:43.984 --> 01:42:44.985]  But it was unannounced to the kids.
[01:42:45.505 --> 01:42:52.608]  We were going for shock value initially, that's a quote, said Navy Lieutenant Dan Duterman, 29.
[01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:57.311]  But in the classrooms, we're showing the students practical applications of what they're learning.
[01:42:58.803 --> 01:43:01.124]  See, it's part of trauma-based mind control, folks.
[01:43:01.224 --> 01:43:04.266]  And then people then love their oppressors.
[01:43:04.306 --> 01:43:05.767]  That's also the psychology they're going for.
[01:43:06.547 --> 01:43:07.408]  The people that shock them.
[01:43:07.468 --> 01:43:10.329]  Some students brought up questions about Kosovo's situation.
[01:43:10.349 --> 01:43:15.952]  And then it's got quotes about Bill Clinton wanted you to know what martial law is like.
[01:43:15.972 --> 01:43:18.554]  I remember that from ten years ago.
[01:43:18.614 --> 01:43:19.754]  Let me find the martial law.
[01:43:20.655 --> 01:43:21.636]  Bill Clinton.
[01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:24.297]  Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton.
[01:43:26.803 --> 01:43:30.247]  There was a quote in there about Bill Clinton.
[01:43:30.287 --> 01:43:31.348]  Well, you can go read the story if you want.
[01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:33.751]  I'm going from 10 year memory there.
[01:43:33.771 --> 01:43:35.093]  It may have been another middle school.
[01:43:36.971 --> 01:43:40.835]  There was several articles in the Pensacola Journal, and that's the problem with 10-year-old memory.
[01:43:40.855 --> 01:43:41.556]  I remember that today.
[01:43:41.576 --> 01:43:46.722]  I had them Google it, and they found it, but there were like, I want to say three articles about it.
[01:43:47.462 --> 01:43:48.063]  So there's others.
[01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:52.368]  Michigan School District portrays homeschoolers as terrorists.
[01:43:52.908 --> 01:43:55.952]  This is a homeschool world alert, but I found this in AP.
[01:43:56.893 --> 01:43:58.074]  On Monday, September 20th, the
[01:44:00.037 --> 01:44:07.144]  Muskogon Chronicle in Michigan reported on a mock attack on public school bus to test terrorism response.
[01:44:07.164 --> 01:44:17.115]  According to the paper, the exercise was a simulated attack by a fictitious radical group called Wackos Against Schools and Education who believe everyone should be homeschooled.
[01:44:18.639 --> 01:44:20.760]  Now imagine, is that trying to demonize homeschoolers?
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:22.480]  And now the federal documents are out.
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:25.761]  They are demonizing homeschoolers in federal documents.
[01:44:25.801 --> 01:44:26.601]  I told you this.
[01:44:27.021 --> 01:44:29.822]  And then they pay cops to go out and brainwash the public.
[01:44:31.123 --> 01:44:38.325]  Imagine, the kids go home and go, yeah, the unannounced came out and threw fake blood on us, put guns to our heads and said, we're wacko homeschoolers against public education.
[01:44:39.245 --> 01:44:40.345]  This was in the AP.
[01:44:42.746 --> 01:44:43.446]  Like it's normal.
[01:44:45.238 --> 01:44:46.219]  Again, this goes on everywhere.
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:47.481]  I just read you Marines doing it.
[01:44:48.001 --> 01:44:56.070]  According to the paper, the exercise was simulated attack by a fictitious group, radical group called Wackos Against Schools and Education to believe everybody should be homeschooled.
[01:44:57.452 --> 01:44:58.673]  It's a way to demonize homeschoolers.
[01:44:59.334 --> 01:45:05.881]  Certainly, disaster preparedness is important, but the terrorists are portrayed as homeschoolers who think everybody should have to homeschool.
[01:45:08.049 --> 01:45:09.510]  Meanwhile, everybody's trying to ban homeschooling.
[01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:18.516]  We immediately called the Muskegon Chronicle and explained how this is offensive to millions of people who have chosen to exercise their rights to homeschool.
[01:45:19.897 --> 01:45:29.043]  Imagine if they said, you know, wacko black people against public schools, or wacko Asians, or wacko Mexicans, or wacko whites.
[01:45:29.083 --> 01:45:29.784]  Folks would get upset.
[01:45:29.804 --> 01:45:30.644]  But no, it's homeschoolers.
[01:45:30.705 --> 01:45:31.085]  It's okay.
[01:45:32.363 --> 01:45:33.344]  But it's the drill itself.
[01:45:33.744 --> 01:45:37.806]  Homeschoolers never have committed violent acts against the public schools or any terrorist acts.
[01:45:37.826 --> 01:45:43.750]  It has not been homeschool children who have walked in public schools shooting everybody and anyone, but rather public school children.
[01:45:44.291 --> 01:45:47.693]  Comparing us to the most dangerous people in the world is a terrible insult and a travesty.
[01:45:48.013 --> 01:45:50.655]  The newspaper promised to print a response and a follow-up story.
[01:45:51.075 --> 01:45:54.597]  Calls already have poured in to Muskegon Intermediate School.
[01:45:55.217 --> 01:46:00.321]  Guys, Google Muskegon Intermediate Homeschool.
[01:46:01.454 --> 01:46:02.495]  And you'll find the AP.
[01:46:02.775 --> 01:46:04.416]  Muskegon Intermediate.
[01:46:04.476 --> 01:46:06.297]  I want the AP on screen for folks.
[01:46:06.777 --> 01:46:08.078]  I want them to see this for themselves.
[01:46:08.098 --> 01:46:10.600]  Of course, it's three years ago, so it may be dead now.
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:17.424]  Calls already poured into the Muskegon Intermediate School District in Muskegon County have issued an apology printed below.
[01:46:18.612 --> 01:46:19.513]  Now here's the background.
[01:46:20.033 --> 01:46:24.737]  Here's what the federal drill, some of the AP said, the cops go, well the feds told us we had to do it this way.
[01:46:25.517 --> 01:46:34.804]  Today the homeschool terrorists in a simulated attack struck a busload of students in the White Hall area, killing more than a half dozen and sending dozens more to hospital.
[01:46:35.185 --> 01:46:40.729]  Although the attack was not real, it looked real to the students, emergency personnel and firefighters responded as if it was real.
[01:46:42.005 --> 01:46:45.868]  Because they come in and they don't tell them it's a drill.
[01:46:46.348 --> 01:46:53.634]  The exercise was funded by the Federal Homeland Security Grants awarded to several area school districts in Muskegon County, Michigan.
[01:46:53.954 --> 01:46:59.939]  The Muskegon Area Intermediate School District partnered with the Muskegon County Emergency Services to implement the mock terror attack.
[01:47:00.959 --> 01:47:09.226]  According to Muskegon Chronicle, the exercise was a simulated attack by a fictitious radical group called the Wackos Against Schools, Education, and Believe Everybody Should Be Homeschooled.
[01:47:10.266 --> 01:47:10.827]  Eight or nine
[01:47:14.701 --> 01:47:15.722]  I can't even read that word.
[01:47:15.742 --> 01:47:24.329]  Oh, deceased students represented by mannequins were transported to the county morgue.
[01:47:24.930 --> 01:47:27.772]  Frantic parents ran to schools and hospital emergency rooms.
[01:47:28.253 --> 01:47:30.715]  So that was out of the local newspaper.
[01:47:32.356 --> 01:47:34.298]  Whatever it is, it's up there in the article.
[01:47:34.338 --> 01:47:35.439]  The Muskegon Chronicle.
[01:47:36.417 --> 01:47:39.058]  And it says, apology issued by the county, September 21st, 2004.
[01:47:39.098 --> 01:47:51.523]  The Muskegon Area Intermediate School District shared the disappointment of others when we learned that September 21st, 2004 emergency preparedness drill referenced homeschoolers as the fictitious group responsible for the mock disaster.
[01:47:51.923 --> 01:47:56.705]  We apologize according to Dan Stout, Chief Deputy Emergency Services of Muskegon County.
[01:47:56.725 --> 01:48:01.807]  The scenario was constructed in his office, a sample scenario
[01:48:03.063 --> 01:48:04.925]  This is where it says the Feds, in my memory, serves.
[01:48:04.985 --> 01:48:05.725]  I haven't read this yet.
[01:48:05.906 --> 01:48:07.527]  I read this, you know, five years ago.
[01:48:08.148 --> 01:48:12.271]  Was required in order to receive the necessary funding for the staged event.
[01:48:12.592 --> 01:48:16.995]  The Muskegon Area Intermediate School District and local schools did not construct the scenario, but participated.
[01:48:17.116 --> 01:48:21.960]  Other county agencies, hospitals, emergency responders in conducting the drill.
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:27.365]  Okay, the AP said it was federal, but you can hear them saying it wasn't theirs, but did you find the AP?
[01:48:29.226 --> 01:48:31.227]  Yeah, they pull their stuff after a few years.
[01:48:31.908 --> 01:48:33.889]  It's kind of like Big Brother gets rid of what he said before.
[01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:41.975]  The exercise was meant to sharpen the skills and response time of our emergency services personnel, but was unfortunately clouded by the choice of the fictional group.
[01:48:44.557 --> 01:48:46.138]  And it goes on to say Homeland Security.
[01:48:46.218 --> 01:48:47.799]  Oh yeah, they said earlier Homeland Security did it.
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:50.081]  With a grant, I'm sorry.
[01:48:50.981 --> 01:48:54.364]  In the world today, I'm just too obsessed with trying to see if my memory's accurate.
[01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:58.703]  In the world today, Homeland Security is a very important issue.
[01:48:58.723 --> 01:49:00.644]  The Training of Our Nation responded, blah, blah, blah.
[01:49:01.444 --> 01:49:02.144]  Homeland Security.
[01:49:02.164 --> 01:49:02.404]  Okay.
[01:49:04.265 --> 01:49:07.766]  Girl handing out cough drops accused of selling drugs at school.
[01:49:08.006 --> 01:49:09.106]  Gave her friend a cough drop.
[01:49:13.035 --> 01:49:13.896]  Bunch of other news.
[01:49:13.916 --> 01:49:15.958]  I mean, I've just got too much of this.
[01:49:16.539 --> 01:49:17.180]  Okay, I'm done.
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.041]  I'm done covering it.
[01:49:18.081 --> 01:49:18.441]  I'm done.
[01:49:18.762 --> 01:49:27.071]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up here at the end because gold has moved massively back up and the news is saying it's going to go past $900 and probably keep sailing.
[01:49:27.211 --> 01:49:27.632]  I don't know.
[01:49:27.712 --> 01:49:30.155]  I just know the way they're devaluing the dollar, it's good to get into gold.
[01:49:30.555 --> 01:49:36.919]  But Ted's got silver way below what I've seen it being sold everywhere else, and it's a collector coin, the Lakota Nation.
[01:49:37.159 --> 01:49:38.380]  And he's selling out of these folks.
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:39.080]  These are hard to get.
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:41.421]  They're like 25 bucks everywhere else I've seen.
[01:49:41.842 --> 01:49:43.503]  He's got them for, what, 17-something.
[01:49:43.543 --> 01:49:44.323]  Ted, tell them about it.
[01:49:44.623 --> 01:49:45.123]  Yeah, I do.
[01:49:45.264 --> 01:49:57.771]  Actually, they're at $17.71 right now, and the thing about the Lakota Nation coin is that it's so popular because of the fact that they have a currency value on it, and it has to do with the sovereign nation.
[01:49:58.711 --> 01:50:07.419]  We've seen what happened to the Liberty Dollar and that stuff when the government stepped in and it's like the collector market just moved in on them and jumped them up over a hundred bucks a piece.
[01:50:07.499 --> 01:50:07.819]  Are you kidding?
[01:50:07.839 --> 01:50:09.861]  There were three hundred, four hundred bucks and still over a hundred.
[01:50:09.901 --> 01:50:11.902]  So, yeah, this is people waiting for a train wreck.
[01:50:11.942 --> 01:50:13.884]  I think that's the reason these are selling for so much.
[01:50:13.904 --> 01:50:15.605]  But you've got them at what you bought them for.
[01:50:15.826 --> 01:50:16.566]  Right, exactly.
[01:50:16.586 --> 01:50:21.150]  They're at $17.71 and even consider the fact that silver went up today.
[01:50:21.490 --> 01:50:23.252]  That is a fabulous price on those.
[01:50:23.292 --> 01:50:24.613]  It's a great way to get in rounds.
[01:50:25.071 --> 01:50:26.252]  Gold is up too, Alex.
[01:50:26.272 --> 01:50:26.972]  We should talk about that.
[01:50:26.992 --> 01:50:31.215]  And by the way, in the last week, I told you last week when you first got these, or two weeks ago, that I wanted some.
[01:50:31.475 --> 01:50:32.135]  I've been too busy.
[01:50:32.455 --> 01:50:34.137]  Will you save me ten?
[01:50:34.177 --> 01:50:35.197]  Just put an order in, Ted.
[01:50:35.237 --> 01:50:36.198]  Take it out of my paycheck.
[01:50:36.618 --> 01:50:36.878]  Ten.
[01:50:37.038 --> 01:50:37.659]  I want ten of them.
[01:50:37.719 --> 01:50:37.939]  Ten.
[01:50:37.979 --> 01:50:38.459]  You got it.
[01:50:38.859 --> 01:50:39.039]  Ten.
[01:50:39.079 --> 01:50:39.820]  Ten silver coins.
[01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:40.040]  Great.
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:40.220]  Yep.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:41.481]  Big high roller here, folks.
[01:50:41.521 --> 01:50:42.421]  About here, about there.
[01:50:42.862 --> 01:50:43.922]  But over the years, it builds up.
[01:50:44.263 --> 01:50:46.044]  So I got ten of these coming to me right now.
[01:50:46.064 --> 01:50:47.565]  In fact, Ted, you just got my order right there.
[01:50:47.605 --> 01:50:47.965]  Sold!
[01:50:48.005 --> 01:50:49.005]  The man named Alex Jones.
[01:50:49.206 --> 01:50:49.666]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:51.167 --> 01:50:52.047]  Spring is here.
[01:50:52.308 --> 01:50:53.068]  Growing season.
[01:50:53.268 --> 01:50:55.249]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:50:55.449 --> 01:50:56.850]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:50:57.170 --> 01:50:57.830]  Think about it.
[01:50:58.151 --> 01:51:01.993]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:51:02.233 --> 01:51:05.694]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:51:05.915 --> 01:51:08.496]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:51:08.756 --> 01:51:20.622]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:51:20.862 --> 01:51:21.302]  I think so.
[01:51:50.177 --> 01:51:55.407]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:51:56.207 --> 01:52:01.550]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:08.274]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:08.594 --> 01:52:10.415]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:10.555 --> 01:52:12.956]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:13.016 --> 01:52:23.902]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:26.209 --> 01:52:27.450]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:29.271]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:29.732 --> 01:52:36.077]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:36.637 --> 01:52:44.423]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:44.904 --> 01:52:46.064]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:46.485 --> 01:52:47.686]  The people strike back.
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:51.981]  Recognize that sound?
[01:52:52.301 --> 01:52:56.844]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[01:52:57.084 --> 01:52:59.225]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[01:52:59.546 --> 01:53:04.629]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[01:53:04.849 --> 01:53:10.012]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[01:53:10.252 --> 01:53:13.414]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[01:53:13.695 --> 01:53:15.796]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[01:53:16.136 --> 01:53:23.379]  Introducing Choose for Health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 super fruits, seed vegetables, and antioxidants.
[01:53:23.739 --> 01:53:26.280]  Stop paying for nutrients your body doesn't use.
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.080]  Order Choose for Health today.
[01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:28.500]  1-800-210-1922.
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:37.844]  The first 300 callers will receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's Unbalanced Diet.
[01:53:38.164 --> 01:53:41.365]  Isn't it time you stop flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[01:53:41.385 --> 01:53:41.445]  1-800-210-1922.
[01:53:44.926 --> 01:53:46.630]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[01:53:52.253 --> 01:53:53.134]  All right.
[01:53:53.214 --> 01:53:59.899]  Retransmission starts at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com in T-minus six minutes with all the key news I covered.
[01:53:59.959 --> 01:54:02.040]  Economic, military, your phone calls today.
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:04.042]  We'll be back to live, of course.
[01:54:04.442 --> 01:54:08.465]  Back live tomorrow, of course, from 11 to 3 p.m.
[01:54:09.046 --> 01:54:09.906]  Central Standard Time.
[01:54:09.926 --> 01:54:12.208]  A lot of phone calls on the show and big guests tomorrow.
[01:54:12.248 --> 01:54:15.150]  Ron Paul scheduled for the show tomorrow.
[01:54:15.250 --> 01:54:15.951]  Ted Anderson.
[01:54:17.549 --> 01:54:21.571]  Again, you have for $17.71 Lakota rounds.
[01:54:22.351 --> 01:54:23.432]  That is insane.
[01:54:24.432 --> 01:54:29.074]  Again, you buy them in bulk, so you get a huge discount, and then you sell those at cost as a loss leader.
[01:54:29.515 --> 01:54:31.356]  So I've talked to Ted, that is at cost for him.
[01:54:31.696 --> 01:54:34.837]  They have the Lakota rounds, beautiful silver coins.
[01:54:34.937 --> 01:54:35.778]  I'm getting ten of them.
[01:54:36.058 --> 01:54:36.718]  They got them right now.
[01:54:36.758 --> 01:54:38.059]  What else do you have in gold, Ted?
[01:54:38.079 --> 01:54:41.760]  You've got it from weeks ago when it was at a low, now it's going back up at a high.
[01:54:42.201 --> 01:54:44.742]  Right now, I mean, gold hit a high today at $9.10, and it's over $900.
[01:54:44.782 --> 01:54:45.302]  It's $9.07 right now.
[01:54:47.996 --> 01:54:48.856]  Remember the Franks?
[01:54:48.916 --> 01:54:52.798]  They were trading up there at $220 last time we were in that price range.
[01:54:52.838 --> 01:54:54.419]  Right now we're at $214.
[01:54:54.819 --> 01:54:55.779]  British Sovereigns are at $267.
[01:54:55.839 --> 01:54:57.560]  Those ones are closer to $279.
[01:55:00.356 --> 01:55:01.057]  I don't think so.
[01:55:18.809 --> 01:55:19.670]  The market went up.
[01:55:19.730 --> 01:55:22.253]  I mean, GM right now is on the edge of bankruptcy.
[01:55:22.293 --> 01:55:24.876]  We've got so many different things that are going on in the economy.
[01:55:24.896 --> 01:55:29.502]  I mean, it's just hard to... Obama spent $12.8 trillion in saying he's balancing the budget.
[01:55:29.802 --> 01:55:31.544]  More money than all presidents before him combined.
[01:55:31.824 --> 01:55:33.606]  It's total Kool-Aid la-la land.
[01:55:33.967 --> 01:55:36.089]  They're admitting more and more jobs are going to be lost.
[01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:40.532]  But, when the public finally finds out, a lot of us are awake, but a lot of them aren't.
[01:55:40.832 --> 01:55:46.635]  And in a way, that's kind of a good thing, because what the elite call the cattle haven't figured out how bad things are.
[01:55:46.675 --> 01:55:50.817]  In a way, that's good, because it gives us a chance to get protected before it totally collapses.
[01:55:50.857 --> 01:55:51.797]  We wish it wouldn't happen.
[01:55:52.197 --> 01:55:53.678]  But, you need to give the brokers a call.
[01:55:53.698 --> 01:55:55.519]  They're going to be there until midnight tonight, right Ted?
[01:55:55.799 --> 01:55:56.599]  Yeah, they'll be here.
[01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:58.480]  How long can they hold that deal?
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:55:59.381]  Because this is gold.
[01:55:59.621 --> 01:56:01.102]  Well, this is gold you bought, and it was $25, $30 less?
[01:56:02.222 --> 01:56:03.583]  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.
[01:56:03.644 --> 01:56:06.807]  I mean, right now I'm going to hold the deal until they run out of quantities, that's all.
[01:56:06.867 --> 01:56:14.995]  And if you call us at 1-800-686-2237, I don't care if I run out or not, I'm still going to hold those prices clean through midnight tonight.
[01:56:15.115 --> 01:56:18.138]  So, you're welcome to call for them, and I'd lock in on them.
[01:56:18.178 --> 01:56:24.205]  Because, I mean, by fall this year, a lot of crap is going to hit the fan.
[01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:27.252]  And gold has always done better in the fall.
[01:56:39.684 --> 01:56:48.206]  All I know is gold five years ago was, you know, 300 bucks an ounce, and it's 900 and something right now, and the graph keeps going up, so everything else is going down.
[01:56:48.266 --> 01:56:52.647]  It is a smart move, ladies and gentlemen, with what's happening in the stock market.
[01:56:52.667 --> 01:56:52.727]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:56:52.747 --> 01:56:52.788]  800-686-2237.
[01:56:52.808 --> 01:56:54.948]  And you cannot beat those Lakota rounds, Lakota Nation.
[01:57:02.150 --> 01:57:05.854]  Well, they're on eBay right now from $20 to $25, so I don't know how you can beat them.
[01:57:05.894 --> 01:57:07.475]  Nobody has them out there at that price.
[01:57:07.495 --> 01:57:12.461]  Well, no, when you said you had them a couple weeks ago, I wanted to look at them, so I went and looked at eBay, and I was like, that's $24, $25.
[01:57:12.941 --> 01:57:14.202]  And Ted's got them for $17.
[01:57:14.262 --> 01:57:15.744]  What a deal!
[01:57:15.764 --> 01:57:15.744]  $800, $686, $2237.
[01:57:17.986 --> 01:57:19.788]  Will the brokers be there till midnight, Ted?
[01:57:19.808 --> 01:57:24.192]  Because I've got a lot of listeners on AM and FM and internet and shortwave that listen at night, and they want to call.
[01:57:24.413 --> 01:57:25.654]  They'll be hearing this at midnight.
[01:57:26.254 --> 01:57:29.737]  Yeah, they'll be here because the phones ring and there's a lot of business.
[01:57:29.757 --> 01:57:30.497]  They're here for that.
[01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:31.758]  They'll be here for you.
[01:57:31.878 --> 01:57:32.599]  So call in.
[01:57:33.079 --> 01:57:38.703]  If you happen to hit a voicemail, let us know that you need this deal and we'll still honor it tomorrow.
[01:57:38.723 --> 01:57:39.403]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:39.423 --> 01:57:39.763]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:40.884 --> 01:57:45.387]  Or go to MidasResources.com.
[01:57:45.407 --> 01:57:48.009]  We've got links to it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:49.470]  Ted, thanks for spending five minutes with us.
[01:57:49.730 --> 01:57:51.051]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:57:51.311 --> 01:57:51.632]  You bet.
[01:57:51.652 --> 01:57:51.712]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:08.746 --> 01:58:11.167]  I was joking saying they'd be demonizing it, and actually they are.
[01:58:11.528 --> 01:58:13.389]  When I start thinking about it, oh wait, they are demonizing it.
[01:58:13.729 --> 01:58:14.970]  And they want to get rid of paper money.
[01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:16.190]  They want to go purely to digital.
[01:58:16.631 --> 01:58:18.852]  Retransmission starts now on the InfoWars streams.
[01:58:19.172 --> 01:58:20.753]  Please keep spreading the word about the show.
[01:58:21.013 --> 01:58:23.415]  People are waking up big time thanks to you.
[01:58:23.775 --> 01:58:25.176]  God bless you all.
[01:58:25.256 --> 01:58:25.656]  Take care.
[01:58:26.256 --> 01:58:31.259]  Great job, crew, by the way.
[01:58:31.319 --> 01:58:34.521]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:34.561 --> 01:58:36.362]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:39.551 --> 01:58:41.137]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:41.237 --> 01:58:44.629]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today...
