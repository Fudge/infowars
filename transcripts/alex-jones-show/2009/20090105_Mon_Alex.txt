[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:01.450]  They don't want to see us use
[00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:35.369]  I think.
[00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:11.208]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:01:11.468 --> 00:01:12.048]  to 3 p.m.
[00:01:12.068 --> 00:01:18.430]  we're live on the radio and we simulcast sometimes the entire four-hour show but always the last hour.
[00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.790]  We're now live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:26.212]  One and a half hours in to this worldwide transmission on the AM and FM dial.
[00:01:26.672 --> 00:01:30.533]  Global shortwave satellite and the internet both audio and visual.
[00:01:33.908 --> 00:01:37.809]  At PrisonPlanet.TV and we do this because of our brotherly love.
[00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.392]  We do this because we know there's wicked, sadistic tyrants in control of the planet.
[00:01:47.572 --> 00:01:48.833]  The Anglo-American elite.
[00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:50.973]  All of us are under attack.
[00:01:52.814 --> 00:01:56.255]  Black, white, old, young, Hispanic, Asian.
[00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:01.296]  The North, the South, Christian, Muslim, Jew.
[00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:07.518]  In the final equation, the New World Order is waging war against the Hindu.
[00:02:09.518 --> 00:02:12.419]  Against the Sunni, the Shiite.
[00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.240]  Against the Sephardi.
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.741]  We are together.
[00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:23.282]  And they don't want to see us unite.
[00:02:24.422 --> 00:02:27.203]  All they want to do is see us fuss and fight.
[00:02:30.374 --> 00:02:38.561]  All they want to see us do is go on killing one another.
[00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:56.836]  Alright, let me tell you what's coming up in the next two hours and plus that we have left today.
[00:02:57.984 --> 00:02:59.065]  Two hours and twenty-five minutes.
[00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:02.208]  Dr. Russell Blaylock joins us for the last hour and a half.
[00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:08.934]  Brain surgeon, neuroscientist, dealing with the toxins in our food and water by design, the eugenics agenda.
[00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:16.681]  He's one of the most prestigious in his field out there and we'll have his bio up on screen for you.
[00:03:17.682 --> 00:03:18.523]  That is coming up.
[00:03:18.563 --> 00:03:23.147]  We're going to be taking calls in the meantime and covering the news on a host of issues.
[00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.335]  I'm going to get into what's happening in Gaza right now, clearly part of Obama's unpopular surprise that Joseph Biden and others promised the public.
[00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:41.902]  I'm then going to get into the fact that the right wing and the left wing are controlled by the same interests, and they're bringing in their global carbon taxes and exactly what that's going to mean to the economy and society.
[00:03:41.942 --> 00:03:51.008]  And Pat Robertson disgustingly pushing it and saying it's of the Lord, kind of like he said forced abortion in China was something he didn't like, but they're doing what they had to do.
[00:03:51.028 --> 00:03:52.990]  It's a tacit approval of that.
[00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:59.158]  And Christians will attack me saying that how dare I not want to abort the Chinese babies now.
[00:03:59.178 --> 00:04:02.721]  It's kind of very twisted how things are working, so that's coming up.
[00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:18.052]  And then I never get into UFOs, but I briefly want to get into Project Blue Beam some next hour, because on Larry King Live and on ABC News and everywhere, people keep sending me emails going, my God, giant cigar-shaped craft, the UFOs, the aliens.
[00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:22.594]  They're over Albuquerque, they're over Dallas, they're over L.A., they're over everywhere.
[00:04:22.614 --> 00:04:23.274]  They're going to get us.
[00:04:23.614 --> 00:04:25.896]  And you see the video and it's a giant blimp.
[00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:31.160]  But the military won't admit what they're doing and so the public thinks it's... the media acts like it's aliens.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.941]  Little green aliens from Mars.
[00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:39.666]  Folks... Again, I'm not poo-pooing that there might be some other life in the universe.
[00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:41.886]  I think that's of certainty.
[00:04:42.387 --> 00:05:00.792]  The issue here is the government admits, they always admit when they're in the planning stages, ten years ago I made films about it, that they're going to put over every major city, drone blimps, I'm going to get into it later, and you can see it, it is a blimp, these giant craft are blimps, and it doesn't matter to the public.
[00:05:01.687 --> 00:05:04.968]  Because the media is telling him it's Little Green Men, so we'll get into that.
[00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:09.069]  I mean, you know, I'm the kook because I don't believe in Little Green Men, but Larry King lied.
[00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:10.829]  That's good mainstream and it's aliens.
[00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:23.192]  So, Pat Robertson's for abortion, and mainstream media is saying aliens are real, and I'm the weirdo because I'm saying that isn't very Christian conservative of Pat Robertson.
[00:05:23.212 --> 00:05:23.692]  It isn't very
[00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:25.862]  Credible for the media.
[00:05:26.302 --> 00:05:27.763]  The media knows their blimps, folks.
[00:05:27.783 --> 00:05:28.923]  They think you're complete idiots.
[00:05:29.404 --> 00:05:30.384]  And they're just messing with you.
[00:05:31.004 --> 00:05:33.426]  Okay, let me go ahead and get to the Gaza situation.
[00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:35.667]  Punch up on screen this article, please.
[00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.550]  This is from Global Research.
[00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.211]  We have it posted up on InfoWars.com.
[00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:44.092]  We're going to get Professor Chosodosky on later.
[00:05:44.773 --> 00:05:52.137]  But what I like about his article from GlobalResearch.ca is that he lays out all the facts that we're aware of here.
[00:05:52.657 --> 00:05:56.439]  And so that I can, I trust the professor, but I also verify.
[00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.821]  And so I'm already acutely aware of everything that's in his article.
[00:05:59.981 --> 00:06:01.122]  But I know a lot of the public aren't.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.663]  Now, I'm not bringing that up to say, oh, I'm smart, I know about this.
[00:06:04.703 --> 00:06:06.965]  I'm saying, this is accurate information.
[00:06:07.365 --> 00:06:08.607]  I have confirmed it for myself.
[00:06:09.127 --> 00:06:12.791]  Now, it is a lengthy article, to say the least.
[00:06:14.312 --> 00:06:32.345]  Okay, so I am not going to have time on air today to read this all, but if you want to be informed, and not just be lied to by the controlled corporate propagandist, you need to go to Infowars.com and read this story, and then link through to his site and read more there as well, previous articles, if you want to be informed.
[00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.848]  Now, let's go ahead and go over some of this article.
[00:06:36.928 --> 00:06:37.289]  Here we go.
[00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:43.133]  The invasion of Gaza, Operation Cast Lead, part of a broader Israeli military intelligence agenda.
[00:06:44.224 --> 00:06:50.528]  The aerial bombings and the ongoing ground invasion of Gaza by Israeli ground forces must be analyzed in a historical context.
[00:06:50.628 --> 00:07:01.036]  Operation Cast Lead is a carefully planned undertaking that is part of a broader military-industrial agenda first formulated by the government and the Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2001.
[00:07:01.736 --> 00:07:05.579]  Sources in the defense establishment said Defense Minister Ehud Barak
[00:07:07.296 --> 00:07:14.381]  Instructed the Israeli Defense Forces to prepare for the operation over six months ago, even as Israel was beginning to negotiate a ceasefire agreement with Hamas.
[00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:20.965]  That is, Barak Ravid, Operation Cast Lead, Israeli Air Force strikes followed months of planning, Haraj, December 2007.
[00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:20.965]  2008.
[00:07:21.025 --> 00:07:21.806]  Okay, so that is Haraj, December 27, 2008.
[00:07:23.507 --> 00:07:26.669]  It was Israel which broke the truce only
[00:07:33.211 --> 00:07:34.212]  On the day of the U.S.
[00:07:34.252 --> 00:07:37.054]  presidential elections, November 4th, everybody was distracted.
[00:07:37.674 --> 00:07:44.338]  Kind of like U.S., NATO, Israeli forces attacked the Russians in South Ossetia on 888 with the Olympics kicking off.
[00:07:44.638 --> 00:07:45.859]  They do it when people aren't looking.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.081]  It's classic military operations.
[00:07:49.275 --> 00:07:50.717]  And again he has link after link.
[00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:56.344]  Israel has used the distraction to break the ceasefire between itself and Hamas by bombing the Gaza Strip.
[00:07:57.246 --> 00:08:01.751]  Israel claimed this violation of the ceasefire would prevent Hamas from digging tunnels into Israel territory.
[00:08:02.352 --> 00:08:06.798]  The very next day Israel launched a terrorizing siege of Gaza cutting off fuel, food,
[00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:14.083]  Medical supplies and other necessities in an attempt to subdue the Palestinians while at the same time engaging in armed incursion.
[00:08:14.383 --> 00:08:19.506]  In response, Hamas and others in Gaza again resorted to firing crude, homemade, and mainly inaccurate rockets into Israel.
[00:08:19.886 --> 00:08:23.909]  During the past seven years, these rockets have been responsible for the deaths of 17 Israelis.
[00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:32.334]  Over the same time span, Israel blitzkrieg results in killing thousands of Palestinians, drawing worldwide protest, but failing and falling on deaf ears at the UN.
[00:08:34.008 --> 00:08:39.973]  And that's Shamas Cookie, the massacre in Palestine, the threat of wider war, Global Research, December 2008.
[00:08:40.373 --> 00:08:42.715]  Now, here's where the story gets into the key area.
[00:08:44.036 --> 00:08:46.418]  Planned humanitarian disaster.
[00:08:46.479 --> 00:08:47.579]  On December 8th, U.S.
[00:08:47.599 --> 00:08:56.427]  Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte was in Tel Aviv for discussions with the Israeli counterparts, including the Director of Mossad, Dagan.
[00:08:57.188 --> 00:09:02.052]  Operation Cast Lead was initiated two days after Christmas.
[00:09:03.533 --> 00:09:15.620]  It was coupled with a carefully designed international public relations campaign of the auspices of Israeli's foreign ministry saying that Hamas had broken the ceasefire when they hadn't.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.824]  It was Israel bombing all over the nation and also cutting off all the border entrances and not allowing any food or medicine in.
[00:09:22.984 --> 00:09:25.207]  Hamas military targets are not the main objective.
[00:09:25.287 --> 00:09:30.013]  Operation Cast Lead is intended quite deliberately to trigger civilian casualties.
[00:09:30.413 --> 00:09:35.720]  What we're dealing with is a planned humanitarian disaster, that's a quote, in Gaza in a densely populated urban area.
[00:09:36.521 --> 00:09:37.903]  See the map on your screen.
[00:09:40.216 --> 00:09:46.562]  The longer term objective of the plan, as formulated by Israeli policy makers, is the expulsion of Palestinians from Palestinian lands.
[00:09:47.063 --> 00:09:48.564]  Terrorize the civilian population.
[00:09:48.584 --> 00:09:50.326]  This is a quote from Israeli war planning.
[00:09:50.787 --> 00:09:57.313]  Terrorize the civilian population, ensuring maximum, maximal destruction of property and cultural resources.
[00:09:57.373 --> 00:09:59.996]  The daily life of the Palestinians must be rendered unbearable.
[00:10:00.256 --> 00:10:02.658]  They should be locked up in the cities and towns, prevented from
[00:10:03.479 --> 00:10:07.124]  Exercising normal economic life, cut off from the workplaces, schools and hospitals.
[00:10:07.465 --> 00:10:12.392]  This will encourage immigration and weaken the resistance to future expulsions.
[00:10:13.593 --> 00:10:16.798]  Err Shalinski quoted by Gillian Hussain.
[00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:19.241]  Gaza, the world's largest prison.
[00:10:19.622 --> 00:10:20.243]  Global Research.
[00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:24.670]  And then they go into all the Israeli war planning where this is admitted.
[00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.251]  Operation Justified Vengeance.
[00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:28.491]  A turning point has been reached.
[00:10:28.871 --> 00:10:35.693]  Operation Cast Lead is part of a broader military intelligence operation initiated at the onset of Ariel Sharon's government in 2001.
[00:10:35.894 --> 00:10:41.255]  It was under Sharon's Operation Justified Vengeance that F-16 fighter planes were initially used to bomb Palestinian cities.
[00:10:41.735 --> 00:10:47.417]  Operation Justified Vengeance was presented in July 2001 to the Israeli government of Ariel Sharon by the IDF staff,
[00:10:51.044 --> 00:10:55.987]  MoFAS, under the title, The Destruction of the Palestinian Authority and the Disarmament of All Armed Forces.
[00:10:56.588 --> 00:11:05.234]  A contingency plan, codenamed Operation Justified Vengeance, was drawn up last June 2001 to reoccupy all the West Bank and possibly the Gaza Strip
[00:11:06.201 --> 00:11:08.903]  As a likely cost of hundreds of Israeli casualties.
[00:11:08.963 --> 00:11:10.643]  Washington Times, 19th, March 2002.
[00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:24.611]  According to Jane's Foreign Report, Jane's Weapons Quarterly, July 12, 2001, the Israeli Army under Sharon had updated its plans for an all-out assault to smash the Palestinian Authority, force out leader Yasser Arafat, and kill or detain its army.
[00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:28.173]  Bloodshed justification.
[00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.773]  The bloodshed justification was an essential component of the military intelligence agenda.
[00:11:34.053 --> 00:11:37.295]  The killing of Palestinian civilians was justified on humanitarian grounds.
[00:11:37.355 --> 00:11:41.878]  Israeli military operations were carefully timed to coincide with the suicide attacks.
[00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:46.201]  Again, remember, Israel founded Hamas as a counterbalance against the PLO.
[00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:53.846]  The assault would be launched at the government's discretion after a big suicide bomb attack in Israel, causing widespread deaths and injuries, citing the bloodshed of justification.
[00:11:54.534 --> 00:12:01.447]  That's Tanya Reinhardt, evil unleashed, Israel moved to deploy and destroy the Palestinian Authority in a calculated plan.
[00:12:02.108 --> 00:12:02.970]  Also global research.
[00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:06.997]  The Dagan Plan, Operation Justified Vengeance, was also
[00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:17.178]  Referred to as the Dagan Plan, named after General, now retired, Meir Dagan, who currently heads the Assad Israeli Intelligence Agency.
[00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:22.764]  Reserve General Meir Dagan was Sharon's National Security Advisor in the 2000 election campaign.
[00:12:22.804 --> 00:12:30.010]  The plan was apparently drawn up prior to Sharon's election as Prime Minister in February 2001, according to Alex Fishman, writing for Edoit.
[00:12:30.987 --> 00:12:36.030]  The Dagan Plan consisted in destroying the Palestinian Authority and putting Assad out of the game.
[00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.792]  Operation Justified Vengeance, a secret plan to destroy the Palestinian Authority.
[00:12:41.032 --> 00:12:43.834]  As reported in Foreign Report, Jane,
[00:12:45.003 --> 00:13:01.578]  As disclosed locally by Israel's invasion plan in local papers, reportedly dubbed justified vengeance, would be launched immediately following the next high-casualty suicide bombing, would last about a month and is expected to result in the death of hundreds of Israelis and thousands of Palestinians.
[00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:05.101]  The Dagen plan envisioned the so-called
[00:13:08.035 --> 00:13:29.141]  Cantonization of the Palestinian territories whereby the West Bank and Gaza will be totally cut off from one another with separate governments in each of the territories under the scenario already envisioned in 2001, Israel would negotiate separately with Palestinian forces that are dominant in each territory, Palestinian forces responsible for security, intelligence and even from the Fatah.
[00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:37.023]  This plan was closely resembled the idea of the cantonization of Palestinian territories put forth by a number of ministers.
[00:13:38.712 --> 00:13:40.613]  That's from Le Monde, the big French publication.
[00:13:41.093 --> 00:13:41.733]  December 17, 2001.
[00:13:42.633 --> 00:13:46.814]  The Dagan Plan was established continuity in the military intelligence agenda.
[00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:51.175]  In the wake of the 2000 elections, Mayor Dagan was assigned a key role.
[00:13:51.275 --> 00:13:57.237]  He became Sharon's go-between to the security issues of the President Bush's special envoys, Zinni and Mitchell.
[00:13:57.657 --> 00:14:01.663]  He was subsequently appointed Director of the Mossad by Prime Minister Ariel Saron in 2002.
[00:14:01.723 --> 00:14:04.006]  In the post-Saron period, he remained head of Mossad.
[00:14:04.026 --> 00:14:10.194]  He was reconfirmed in his position as Director of Israeli Intelligence by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in June of 2008.
[00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:15.140]  Coordination with the U.S.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.322]  counterparts has been in charge of various military intelligence operations.
[00:14:18.703 --> 00:14:26.889]  It is worth noting that Mayor Dagan, as a young colonel, had worked closely with Defense Minister Ariel Sharon in the raids on Palestinian settlements in Beirut in 82.
[00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:34.936]  In 2009, ground offensive in Gaza, in the many regards, bear an uncanny resemblance to the 1982 military operation led by Sharon and Dagan.
[00:14:36.837 --> 00:14:38.999]  Continuity from Sharon to Ulmer.
[00:14:39.639 --> 00:14:41.321]  Then it goes through how it's all continuity.
[00:14:43.752 --> 00:14:44.613]  And the basic plan.
[00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:47.314]  One, the assassination in November of Yasser Arafat.
[00:14:47.335 --> 00:14:51.437]  This assassination had been on the drawing board since 1996 under Operation Fields of Thorns.
[00:14:51.457 --> 00:15:09.550]  According to the October 2000 document prepared by the Security Service at the request of then Prime Minister Ehud Barak stated that Arafat, the person to serve, the threat to the Prime Minister, the security of the State of Israel, and the damage which will result from his disappearance is less than the damage caused by his existence.
[00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.411]  And it continues here.
[00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:18.551]  Part 2.
[00:15:18.611 --> 00:15:23.092]  Removal under the orders of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 2005 of all Jewish settlements in Gaza.
[00:15:23.413 --> 00:15:25.633]  A Jewish population over 7,000 was relocated.
[00:15:27.234 --> 00:15:29.114]  This is from CBC, March 2004.
[00:15:29.154 --> 00:15:34.456]  It is my intention, Sharon, to carry out an evacuation
[00:15:35.473 --> 00:15:43.843]  Sorry, or relocation of settlements that cause us problems and of places that we will not hold on to anyway in a final settlement, like the Gaza settlements.
[00:15:43.923 --> 00:15:49.209]  I am working on the assumption that in the future there will be no Jews in Gaza, Saron told CNBC.
[00:15:51.308 --> 00:15:57.293]  The issue of the settlements in Gaza was presented as part of Washington's roadmap to peace, celebrated by the Palestinians as a victory.
[00:15:57.533 --> 00:16:00.215]  This measure was not directed against the Jewish settlers.
[00:16:00.295 --> 00:16:00.915]  Quite the opposite.
[00:16:00.935 --> 00:16:06.099]  It was part of an overall covert operation which consisted in transforming Gaza into a concentration camp.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:13.745]  As long as Jewish settlers were living inside Gaza, the objective of sustaining a large barricade prison territory could not be achieved.
[00:16:15.447 --> 00:16:19.570]  The implementation of Operation Cast Lead required no Jews in Gaza.
[00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:21.968]  That's from CBC.
[00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:28.251]  Number three, the building of the infamous apartheid wall was decided upon at the beginning of the Sharon government.
[00:16:30.253 --> 00:16:41.199]  Four, the next phase of the Hamas election victory in January 2006, without Arafat, the Israeli military intelligence architects knew that Fatah, under Mahmoud Abbas, would lose the elections.
[00:16:41.239 --> 00:16:45.682]  This was part of a scenario which had been envisioned and analyzed well in advance.
[00:16:46.182 --> 00:16:50.205]  With Hamas in charge of the Palestinian Authority, this is key, using the pretext that Hamas is a
[00:16:50.905 --> 00:16:51.827]  Terrorist organization.
[00:16:51.907 --> 00:16:56.695]  Israel would carry out the process of Kentonization as formulated under the Dagan Plan.
[00:16:56.795 --> 00:17:01.123]  FATA under Mahmoud Abbas would remain formally in charge of the West Bank.
[00:17:01.343 --> 00:17:04.669]  The duly elected Hamas government would be confined to the Gaza Strip.
[00:17:06.906 --> 00:17:07.547]  Ground attack.
[00:17:07.587 --> 00:17:11.430]  On January 3rd, the Israeli tanks and infantry entered Gaza in an all-out ground offensive.
[00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:19.797]  The ground operation was preceded by several hours of heavy artillery fire after dark igniting targets and flames and burst into the night sky.
[00:17:19.837 --> 00:17:21.338]  Machine gun fire rattled.
[00:17:22.419 --> 00:17:27.723]  Bright tracer rounds flashed in the darkness and the clash of hundreds of shells set up streaks of fire.
[00:17:27.824 --> 00:17:27.944]  AP.
[00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:32.706]  Israeli sources have pointed to a lengthy, drawn-out military operation.
[00:17:32.986 --> 00:17:36.948]  It won't be easy, and it won't be short, said Defense Minister Ehud Barak in a TV address.
[00:17:37.008 --> 00:17:39.528]  Israel is not seeking to oblige Hamas to cooperate.
[00:17:39.568 --> 00:17:58.835]  What we are dealing with is the implementation of the Dagan Plan, a plan formulated in 2001, which called for an invasion of Palestinian-controlled territory by some 30,000 Israeli soldiers with a clearly defined mission of destroying the infrastructure of the Palestinian leadership and collecting weaponry currently possessed by the various Palestinian forces and expelling or killing its military leadership.
[00:18:00.233 --> 00:18:06.097]  The broader question is whether Israel, in consolidation with Washington, is intent upon triggering a wider war.
[00:18:06.498 --> 00:18:13.603]  Mass expulsion could occur at some later stage of the ground invasion for the Israelis to open up the Gaza borders to allow the exodus of population.
[00:18:14.083 --> 00:18:17.406]  Expulsion was referred to by Ariel Sharon as the 1948 style solution.
[00:18:17.426 --> 00:18:17.806]  Stay with us.

[00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.655]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:19:30.935 --> 00:19:32.616]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film.

[00:19:53.962 --> 00:19:57.005]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.

[00:21:57.373 --> 00:21:59.734]  With us here on the show in the future, adding more and more.
[00:21:59.754 --> 00:22:00.995]  We're going to add a document cam in here.
[00:22:01.015 --> 00:22:04.836]  I'm also going to add a little tablet where I can write on documents and things on screen.
[00:22:05.196 --> 00:22:10.198]  Kind of like Joe Madden with football, but I can put up the Gaza Strip map and go over it.
[00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:11.759]  Things of that nature.
[00:22:11.779 --> 00:22:17.101]  So that's all coming up here as we integrate the radio show with the PrisonPlanet.tv audiences.
[00:22:17.121 --> 00:22:19.282]  We developed the show for putting it on cable.
[00:22:19.302 --> 00:22:21.263]  And we're satellite working on both right now.
[00:22:22.323 --> 00:22:24.164]  And building another full TV studio out here.
[00:22:25.265 --> 00:22:25.445]  But...
[00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:34.262]  Continuing here, at the end of this excellent article that's all meticulously sourced, most of it right out of the Israeli and U.S.
[00:22:34.302 --> 00:22:34.763]  newspapers,
[00:22:36.839 --> 00:22:45.865]  It ends with the mass expulsion could occur at some later state of the ground invasion where the Israelis to open up Gaza border to allow for an exodus of the population.
[00:22:46.206 --> 00:22:50.008]  Expulsion was referred to by Ariel Sharon as the 1948 style solution.
[00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:53.470]  For Sharon it is only necessary to find another state for the Palestinians.
[00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:57.073]  Jordan is Palestine was a phrase that Sharon coined.
[00:22:59.938 --> 00:23:04.279]  So, put that map back up there, if you can, of the Gaza Strip for folks.
[00:23:05.179 --> 00:23:14.261]  Again, they're bordering southern Israel to the east, Egypt to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to its west.
[00:23:15.641 --> 00:23:16.582]  That's the other map.
[00:23:17.382 --> 00:23:23.423]  They are completely surrounded.
[00:23:24.983 --> 00:23:27.644]  They are completely surrounded
[00:23:30.243 --> 00:23:33.824]  And they are under total siege.
[00:23:33.844 --> 00:23:40.565]  And if you look on the map, you see Gaza City, the largest, with around 800,000 of the population.
[00:23:40.946 --> 00:23:47.787]  Then the other 700,000 are in some of the central cities and the southern cities.
[00:23:48.727 --> 00:23:52.188]  And what the Israeli military has done is they've encircled Gaza City.
[00:23:52.868 --> 00:23:55.849]  They've got gunboats and naval forces.
[00:23:59.304 --> 00:24:01.465]  all along its border with the Mediterranean.
[00:24:06.369 --> 00:24:14.634]  Again down here to the south you have Egypt that the Gaza Strip formerly belonged to and simply put
[00:24:15.953 --> 00:24:20.914]  The Ottoman Empire for hundreds of years controlled much of the Middle East and, of course, Israel.
[00:24:21.234 --> 00:24:25.655]  And then when they fell after World War I, the British came in and filled the vacuum.
[00:24:26.295 --> 00:24:39.378]  And the Rothschilds, owned and controlled since their scam they ran in 1815, buying up the stock market, claiming that Napoleon had won the Battle of Waterloo, they were able to finance folks in Israel actually attacking British forces.
[00:24:39.858 --> 00:24:42.958]  And after the British were kicked out, what is the 1948 option?
[00:24:43.298 --> 00:24:44.679]  Israel declares sovereignty in 1947.
[00:24:46.195 --> 00:24:54.377]  And then begins bombing, shooting, killing Arabs that were living there, Palestinians, and pushing them out.
[00:24:54.637 --> 00:24:55.837]  That's the expulsion model.
[00:24:56.077 --> 00:25:04.719]  So you have Israel, and that's why you had the Arabs who had been there for thousands of years, back in the time when it was Judea, who lived in peace with the Jews.
[00:25:04.739 --> 00:25:09.680]  In fact, it would be the Arabs and the Jews generally fighting with the Romans and the Babylonians and others.
[00:25:10.658 --> 00:25:13.239]  And it hadn't been Israel since 70 A.D.
[00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:16.599]  when Titus went in and did what Israel's doing to the Palestinians.
[00:25:16.839 --> 00:25:17.919]  Put the map back up right here.
[00:25:17.939 --> 00:25:18.820]  I want to show people something.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.400]  Zoom in on this.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.000]  I want to point it out here on my screen.
[00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:26.321]  Let's cut to camera two and I want to show people here on the screen myself.
[00:25:28.222 --> 00:25:36.503]  Notice that with the pincer attack the Israeli troops came in and circled Gaza City and then circled the other towns and have surrounded it.
[00:25:37.203 --> 00:25:38.084]  What did Titus do?
[00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:39.944]  Well Titus over in Jerusalem
[00:25:41.161 --> 00:25:45.524]  did the same thing nineteen hundred and thirty eight years ago.
[00:25:46.905 --> 00:25:50.988]  He went in, he encircled Jerusalem, waited until they basically starved to death and went in and burned the place down.
[00:25:51.568 --> 00:25:54.230]  So this is just total siege, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:54.710 --> 00:26:00.675]  And Israel's doing what was done to them by the Romans nineteen hundred plus years ago to the Gazans.
[00:26:03.797 --> 00:26:05.618]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:26:07.319 --> 00:26:09.601]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:26:12.631 --> 00:26:19.014]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:26:19.394 --> 00:26:21.355]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:26:22.036 --> 00:26:23.056]  But who is the enemy?
[00:26:23.577 --> 00:26:24.117]  Bin Laden.
[00:26:24.377 --> 00:26:25.297]  This is his ammo.
[00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:26.718]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:26:26.738 --> 00:26:28.399]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:26:28.739 --> 00:26:35.503]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:26:35.883 --> 00:26:36.323]  Some U.S.
[00:26:36.363 --> 00:26:42.006]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:26:42.706 --> 00:26:46.249]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:26:46.589 --> 00:26:56.457]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:26:56.698 --> 00:26:57.438]  Fabled Enemies.

[00:27:15.163 --> 00:27:17.064]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:27:17.544 --> 00:27:20.426]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.370]  Big Brother.
[00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.071]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:29.811 --> 00:27:30.912]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:31.572 --> 00:27:32.373]  You want answers?
[00:27:33.133 --> 00:27:34.034]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:34.054 --> 00:27:38.376]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:38.896 --> 00:27:42.959]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:44.002 --> 00:27:57.705]  All right, I want to get into the economy, all the new taxes they're setting up, how they've got this supposed right-wing gatekeeper, or Judas Goat, the local viceroy over Christian conservatives here in the United States.
[00:27:57.825 --> 00:28:09.667]  Pat Robertson, if you thought him saying China was good to have forced abortion, that he loved their Planned Parenthood program, that they need to be more aggressive, then you're going to love the new stuff he's saying.
[00:28:10.147 --> 00:28:10.467]  He is
[00:28:11.932 --> 00:28:14.774]  Almost trumping Pastor Hagee, saying Jesus isn't the Messiah.
[00:28:14.794 --> 00:28:18.577]  Whether you're Christian or not, that's pretty asinine to have a supposed Christian leader saying that.
[00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:26.462]  He is now out saying that socialism will basically save the United States, and that Obama cannot be stopped, and that Obama's a great guy.
[00:28:27.363 --> 00:28:29.184]  And that socialism will ease our pain.
[00:28:29.665 --> 00:28:32.467]  So, just an amazing thing that's happening there.
[00:28:32.587 --> 00:28:33.487]  That is coming up.
[00:28:34.268 --> 00:28:36.770]  Finishing up with the horrible carnage in Gaza.
[00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.211]  This is tribal warfare.
[00:28:38.771 --> 00:28:40.592]  And both sides have done terrible things to each other.
[00:28:40.632 --> 00:28:41.393]  There's no doubting that.
[00:28:43.971 --> 00:28:50.335]  And Israel can say they have a claim on that from their point of view, but the Arabs have an even stronger claim.
[00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:59.741]  And my whole issue here is, Mexico did control Texas, parts of Louisiana, and then all the way to California.
[00:29:00.321 --> 00:29:01.602]  Before that it was the Spanish Empire.
[00:29:02.883 --> 00:29:06.986]  Now, it's taught in Mexico that the Southwest belongs to Mexico and will be reconquered.
[00:29:07.366 --> 00:29:12.009]  And the billboards are put up and the Spanish speaking TV and radio says that constantly and it's pushed.
[00:29:13.258 --> 00:29:21.802]  Do we want to get into a situation with the United Nations where the group that previously had control of this area is now saying it's theirs?
[00:29:23.363 --> 00:29:33.187]  And usually when I hear that analogy it's an example of the Palestinians previously having control and then now Israel taking it over in the 1940s.
[00:29:33.808 --> 00:29:36.009]  But really if you go back we have
[00:29:37.932 --> 00:29:48.794]  People from all over Europe immigrating there, some of them Jewish, some of them not, saying that because they were there 1938 years ago, that it belongs to Israel.
[00:29:49.635 --> 00:29:54.055]  I mean, the Arabs were always there, they're there now, they have their mosque, their religious centers there.
[00:29:54.376 --> 00:30:00.517]  You know, there wouldn't be such a big deal if this was, say, part of southern Syria or part of
[00:30:02.429 --> 00:30:02.809]  Jordan.
[00:30:02.829 --> 00:30:06.931]  I mean, it would be bad enough if Israel went and took that, but that's just some desert or some mountains.
[00:30:07.471 --> 00:30:08.571]  This is the Holy Land.
[00:30:08.611 --> 00:30:10.032]  This is where the Crusades happened.
[00:30:10.172 --> 00:30:12.333]  This is where the Muslims and the Christians fought before that.
[00:30:12.633 --> 00:30:13.853]  The Jews and the Romans fought.
[00:30:14.273 --> 00:30:17.134]  I mean, this is an area that people have always been fighting over.
[00:30:17.494 --> 00:30:27.598]  What I don't like is the United States being sucked into the middle of it, and the United States funding, on average, $30,000, that's an accurate number, a caller mentioned earlier, per citizen of Israel.
[00:30:28.058 --> 00:30:29.979]  I mean, I'm against foreign aid to anybody.
[00:30:31.141 --> 00:30:45.677]  And as Ron Paul has said, and then the larger issue here domestically is that the media is lying and saying that Hamas broke the ceasefire when the ceasefire deal was that the border entrances would be open to Israel at the checkpoints.
[00:30:45.737 --> 00:30:50.842]  You go through a checkpoint, those are just completely shut down for people to get jobs in Israel and a lot of people in Israel want to hire them.
[00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.911]  And that Israel wouldn't engage in any more bombings in the West Bank.
[00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:57.012]  And they broke that.
[00:30:57.272 --> 00:31:00.773]  They intended to break that the whole time while they were building up, getting ready for this invasion.
[00:31:00.813 --> 00:31:03.754]  Now they've encircled the three major cities and the small towns.
[00:31:04.234 --> 00:31:06.455]  And they're just going to wait it out, let them starve to death basically.
[00:31:06.475 --> 00:31:10.197]  And they've bombed their infrastructure, their small water treatment facilities, their wells.
[00:31:11.057 --> 00:31:12.658]  They have bombed their electrical systems.
[00:31:12.678 --> 00:31:15.399]  They've bombed their communications installations.
[00:31:16.099 --> 00:31:23.996]  And you've got a million and a half people there, ladies and gentlemen, and the tunnels bringing in food and supplies and fuel oil and Israel says weapons, no doubt that's happening.
[00:31:24.277 --> 00:31:25.138]  Those have all been bombed.
[00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:31.908]  Three million Iraqis have died in the 18 years of occupation.
[00:31:32.629 --> 00:31:34.770]  Well, the siege and then the five and a half years of occupation.
[00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.912]  A million and a half of those in the last five and a half years.
[00:31:36.932 --> 00:31:39.113]  I mean, this is horrible what's being done in our name.
[00:31:39.974 --> 00:31:42.275]  And Israel wanted in the 80s to have the U.S.
[00:31:42.315 --> 00:31:45.998]  invade Iraq and break it in three parts, three regional areas, and that's already happened.
[00:31:46.518 --> 00:31:50.181]  So this is part of a larger strategic plan, and it's classical tyranny.
[00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:51.822]  It's classical colonialism.
[00:31:52.462 --> 00:31:57.446]  The Ottomans got kicked out after World War I. The Nazis, the British, fought over North Africa and the Middle East.
[00:31:58.286 --> 00:32:05.930]  The British got control over it after World War II, and Israel came in and kicked the British out and set up Israel, and now we're in the middle of it today.
[00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.070]  That's what happened here.
[00:32:07.971 --> 00:32:10.732]  And it is just a real shame that so many people are dying.
[00:32:10.812 --> 00:32:15.975]  Thousands and thousands of injured Palestinians and well over 700 dead.
[00:32:16.395 --> 00:32:17.835]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:17.896 --> 00:32:18.556]  Stay with us.

[00:35:16.021 --> 00:35:20.186]  That's 1-800-313-6400 today!
[00:35:20.206 --> 00:35:24.952]  He's the T-Rex of political talk!
[00:35:25.513 --> 00:35:28.297]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network!
[00:35:32.199 --> 00:35:39.683]  We have a news report that Kurt Nemo wrote up on the featured stories section of InfoWars.com if you'd like to read along.
[00:35:40.504 --> 00:35:53.912]  It has links to TV programs Pat Robertson has done, to his own CBN show, where he says he likes Obama, he thinks he's a good guy, he supports him.
[00:35:55.510 --> 00:36:23.633]  uh... so that shows you the power structure even when quote christian conservatives main leader comes out and start saying hey i like obama now on the heels of that uh... every year the day after the new year the first day of the year he claims that he gets messages from god and that was that we were going to have a rebellion and riots in the streets and nukes going off uh... in two thousand eight that didn't happen
[00:36:24.987 --> 00:36:26.968]  Most of his predictions end up being wrong.
[00:36:27.028 --> 00:36:28.169]  It's really propaganda.
[00:36:28.949 --> 00:36:38.034]  But if you analyze what he said this year, and we're analyzing it here today, part of it, it's lengthy.
[00:36:40.035 --> 00:36:45.558]  Pat Robertson comes out and he says, the economy is going to get better in 2009.
[00:36:46.098 --> 00:36:53.642]  And he says it's basically going to happen because Obama is going to bring in socialism and Americans are going to embrace it.
[00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.378]  And that is going to lessen their pain.
[00:37:00.379 --> 00:37:11.106]  So, he's doing this in lawyer-speak, kind of like he said it in lawyer-speak, what, back in 2001, when he said, well, China's got really aggressive Planned Parenthood and even some forced abortions.
[00:37:11.126 --> 00:37:16.830]  He said it on CNN, Lurking Live, but he said, you know, China's doing what it has to do, and they need more aggressive family planning.
[00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:27.917]  Now, I even have the Huffington Post this weekend came out about the UN supporting sterilization and forced abortions, and even the liberal Huffington Post is saying this is wrong, but then Pat Robertson is saying it's good.
[00:37:29.295 --> 00:37:31.386]  Because he supports whatever the new world order is pushing.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:47.706]  So now we have the Huffington Post decrying UN population eugenics, but we have Robertson saying it's good, and we have Robertson posing it and phrasing it here, that this is what will save you, this will fix things.
[00:37:47.746 --> 00:37:50.067]  And then he adds, nothing can stop this.
[00:37:50.427 --> 00:37:59.211]  God told him nothing can stand before Obama, this economic restructuring, and then he goes to the talking point of
[00:38:00.598 --> 00:38:03.059]  This will be like the New Deal, but this isn't just the New Deal.
[00:38:03.079 --> 00:38:11.062]  People building bridges and roads and rest stops and power plants and dams, which is bad enough to get people under federal control.
[00:38:11.662 --> 00:38:20.025]  This is going to be youth corps and spy corps and a domestic force of a million people now being announced again by Rahm Emanuel and the incoming White House.
[00:38:20.045 --> 00:38:21.406]  So it's going to be even worse.
[00:38:23.311 --> 00:38:26.693]  And the Fed are talking about taking over failing newspapers and having them be federal.
[00:38:27.013 --> 00:38:28.554]  And they're talking about just all of this.
[00:38:28.834 --> 00:38:33.917]  And a $700 billion payoff for corporations, select corporations, to go along with all this.
[00:38:33.977 --> 00:38:34.657]  So he's...
[00:38:37.307 --> 00:38:44.015]  Laying all this out like it's a good idea, that it's going to ease your pain, and things are going to get better under this, and you can't stop it.
[00:38:44.636 --> 00:38:46.818]  That's what he says in this.
[00:38:46.858 --> 00:38:56.670]  You can go read the transcript carefully at InfoWars.com, and then read his other quotes from separate TV appearances where he says he likes Obama, and Obama's good, and he wants to work with him.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:05.784]  He's also running TV ads with Al Sharpton saying global warming's real, climate change is real, we need these global taxes, which is the economic takeover of the bankers.
[00:39:06.125 --> 00:39:08.466]  So let's go ahead and go to this clip here on screen.
[00:39:08.486 --> 00:39:13.909]  Pat Robertson last week, first day of the new year, laying out his predictions.
[00:39:15.209 --> 00:39:20.112]  So here are some of the things that I feel are going to be happening in 2009.
[00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:27.477]  The Lord said the economy of your nation will recover.
[00:39:27.837 --> 00:39:33.245]  The steps taken will lead to a dramatic increase in the power of government.
[00:39:34.454 --> 00:39:39.416]  The people will welcome socialism in order to relieve their pain.
[00:39:40.017 --> 00:39:50.361]  Nothing will stand in the way of a plan by Obama to restructure the economy in the same fashion as the New Deal in the 30s.
[00:39:51.001 --> 00:39:55.764]  America will never again have the power in the world that it has enjoyed since World War II.
[00:39:56.684 --> 00:40:04.008]  With no strong leadership, dangerous dictators will arise in various parts of the world that will threaten the peace and security of millions of people.
[00:40:04.328 --> 00:40:10.231]  Russia will be the most dangerous and will lead the coalition to control the Middle East.
[00:40:10.791 --> 00:40:13.873]  Israel is entering a period of extreme crisis.
[00:40:14.813 --> 00:40:22.044]  A strong government that deals forcefully with the Palestinians will bring international condemnation and sanctions against Israel.
[00:40:22.184 --> 00:40:26.651]  But the Lord will uphold his people despite world opinion.
[00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:29.515]  The whole of Islam is weakening.
[00:40:30.436 --> 00:40:35.001]  The violence and bloodshed has turned many against this religion of hate.
[00:40:35.081 --> 00:40:37.764]  And the Lord said, expand your outreach to Muslims.
[00:40:37.804 --> 00:40:39.406]  They are ready to listen.
[00:40:40.006 --> 00:40:44.431]  Great and cataclysmic things will become commonplace around the world.
[00:40:44.832 --> 00:40:47.675]  Poverty and misery will be widespread.
[00:40:48.215 --> 00:40:53.680]  There has never been nor will there ever be a more propitious time for the gospel.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.683]  People by the tens of millions will be seeking answers.
[00:40:58.124 --> 00:41:00.906]  They will gladly receive the forgiveness of sins.
[00:41:00.966 --> 00:41:01.567]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:41:02.247 --> 00:41:03.869]  Yeah, but what gospel is it?
[00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.353]  I mean, Pat, you always talk about some Muslim nations.
[00:41:08.373 --> 00:41:11.035]  There's only a few of them where they don't allow Christianity to be taught.
[00:41:11.696 --> 00:41:12.757]  Saudi Arabia, our ally.
[00:41:13.973 --> 00:41:17.910]  But then they attack all the Muslim nations where Christianity flourishes.
[00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:21.291]  But that in Israel, Christianity is illegal to teach.
[00:41:21.311 --> 00:41:22.552]  I mean, why won't you ever talk?
[00:41:22.572 --> 00:41:23.972]  And I'm not even here attacking Israel.
[00:41:24.272 --> 00:41:25.313]  I'm just stating the facts.
[00:41:25.973 --> 00:41:29.315]  And then he goes through, the power of government will grow, but it will fix the economy.
[00:41:30.576 --> 00:41:31.976]  Nothing will stand in its way.
[00:41:32.496 --> 00:41:33.877]  Russia is the big, great evil.
[00:41:33.917 --> 00:41:36.919]  And obviously, any big nation is under wicked control.
[00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:38.459]  That's the nature of government.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.661]  But it wasn't Russia that snuck attacked Georgia.
[00:41:41.981 --> 00:41:42.741]  It was U.S.
[00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:45.923]  Globalist-backed Georgia that attacked them on 888 last year.
[00:41:47.242 --> 00:41:50.624]  So, they are really insulting everybody's intelligence here.
[00:41:51.125 --> 00:41:53.726]  They talk about, you know, Israel being internationally condemned.
[00:41:54.647 --> 00:42:00.811]  And this clearly is Obama's unpopular stance in the New Year, because he will have to comment on what's happening.
[00:42:00.991 --> 00:42:08.075]  And notice how the attacks were launched, when Bush is outgoing, when it's during the holidays, the attacks were launched Christmas Eve, when people are diverted and distracted.
[00:42:08.976 --> 00:42:13.379]  Notice how this is all happening in the in-between time, and then Obama won't comment on it.
[00:42:13.799 --> 00:42:14.740]  And then there's a story
[00:42:16.751 --> 00:42:20.876]  about what's happening in the London Guardian over in Gaza today.
[00:42:21.877 --> 00:42:27.584]  And the story is titled, Obama is losing a battle he doesn't know he's in.
[00:42:28.465 --> 00:42:30.467]  Oh yeah, he doesn't know this is all unpopular.
[00:42:30.967 --> 00:42:36.614]  The President-elect's silence on Gaza crisis is undermining his reputation in the Middle East, and it goes on to say in Europe.
[00:42:37.927 --> 00:42:39.008]  Well, of course he knows this.
[00:42:39.049 --> 00:42:41.231]  This is one of the unpopular things.
[00:42:41.612 --> 00:42:44.476]  And we have Indian, Pakistan, Mazin groups threatening to attack each other.
[00:42:44.756 --> 00:42:49.483]  We had those staged events three or four weeks ago in Mumbai, formerly Bombay.
[00:42:49.523 --> 00:42:50.844]  We have all of this going on.
[00:42:52.208 --> 00:42:54.992]  Also, they're announcing a gas tax hike they want.
[00:42:55.212 --> 00:42:57.536]  They're announcing moves for new federal taxes.
[00:42:57.556 --> 00:43:00.941]  They're announcing windfall profits on retirement investments.
[00:43:01.341 --> 00:43:06.208]  So that means taxing pension funds in 401ks, what the congressional committees have been recommending the last month.
[00:43:06.529 --> 00:43:08.392]  That's also part of the unpopularity.
[00:43:09.977 --> 00:43:22.823]  They've had Rahm Emanuel and others running around on TV again saying, yes, it's going to be compulsory service 18 to 24 in a new domestic military, but that you won't have to go overseas, and that it's not a draft, but you have to do it, which is more double speak.
[00:43:22.843 --> 00:43:24.904]  It's not a draft, but you're going to boot camp.
[00:43:25.745 --> 00:43:30.547]  I think I want to play that clip that we played last night on radio only.
[00:43:30.567 --> 00:43:33.408]  I want to dig that up later in the hour and get to that.
[00:43:37.518 --> 00:43:39.659]  Oh, I had a caller from Chile that hung up.
[00:43:39.799 --> 00:43:43.180]  Rob in Chile, call back and I'll definitely get to you before our next guest comes on.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:43.740]  800-259-9231.
[00:43:45.141 --> 00:43:49.663]  I'm trying to get to your calls, but there's just so much news that has to be covered.
[00:43:49.683 --> 00:43:52.444]  I'm trying to be more disciplined here on the show, but Rob, call us back.
[00:43:52.464 --> 00:44:01.887]  I'm going to go to Mike and Sherry and Jen and Stuart and Rob and everybody else, but I really want to hear from folks outside of the United States and other parts of the world.
[00:44:01.947 --> 00:44:04.168]  It's always so interesting to get their take on what's happening.
[00:44:04.368 --> 00:44:06.529]  Okay, briefly, in the time we've got left in this segment,
[00:44:08.493 --> 00:44:28.209]  Most, this is a totally separate area, most of the UFO reports that we see being hyped by NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, Larry King Live, like UFOs are landing, they're real, aliens are real, why is the mainstream media
[00:44:29.659 --> 00:44:30.920]  Behaving like all this is real.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:38.546]  We know there's a declassified government plan, Project Blue Beam, that's on the books, we don't know if they'll ever do it, to claim aliens have invaded to unify a world government.
[00:44:40.188 --> 00:44:47.734]  They have other programs with big holograms they can project that are declassified to show Buddha, Allah, Jesus, or anything else they want.
[00:44:48.314 --> 00:44:53.759]  We're talking 2,000, 3,000 foot tall holograms that they can project to freak people out.
[00:44:54.915 --> 00:45:00.179]  And I ask, why is the mainstream media now hyping UFOs and aliens and saying it's real?
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.824]  Now, there are scores of these press reports, and in most of them, they don't even say it's probably a blimp.
[00:45:06.985 --> 00:45:11.749]  These giant, you know, 2-3 football field long, cigar-shaped things.
[00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:16.693]  They don't even say that it's a blimp, or that it could be a blimp.
[00:45:16.933 --> 00:45:18.995]  They just say, UFO, what is it?
[00:45:21.544 --> 00:45:22.924]  I meant to pull this up for the show.
[00:45:23.305 --> 00:45:25.145]  One of you Google this, because I forgot to do it.
[00:45:25.205 --> 00:45:30.446]  Google Homeland Security blimps.
[00:45:32.647 --> 00:45:36.288]  Or Homeland Security to use blimps to protect U.S.
[00:45:36.568 --> 00:45:37.208]  Something like that.
[00:45:37.228 --> 00:45:40.149]  It's actually in my film, Martial Law.
[00:45:41.178 --> 00:46:07.547]  They announced giant high altitude, between 80,000 and 100 plus thousand feet, robot blimps that are computer controlled with solar panels on them that charge batteries with these big propellers, and up there there's not a lot of winds so it's very easy for them to stay very still, and that they're going to have ground penetrating radar looking through your houses, incredible optics, even better than satellites, watching and surveilling the American people under homeland security.
[00:46:09.352 --> 00:46:11.354]  And then now these blimps are arriving.
[00:46:12.355 --> 00:46:22.543]  I remember CNN, there's a CNN article where you can see DC with the monument and the big surveillance blimp for Homeland Security.
[00:46:22.563 --> 00:46:23.324]  It's the same blimp.
[00:46:24.545 --> 00:46:32.211]  Now suddenly the news says, no, it's not blimps, it's not Homeland Security, we don't know what it is, and the FAA comes out and says,
[00:46:38.464 --> 00:46:39.304]  This isn't the government.
[00:46:39.544 --> 00:46:40.644]  We don't pick it up on radar.
[00:46:41.905 --> 00:46:49.946]  We're going out of break here, but just so people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv during the break have a chance to see what we're seeing.
[00:46:49.986 --> 00:46:55.228]  Without audio, start playing that particular ABC newscast and then some of the amateur video.
[00:46:55.388 --> 00:46:55.988]  And you can see it.
[00:46:56.048 --> 00:46:57.248]  You see the propellers.
[00:46:57.588 --> 00:46:59.468]  You can see the blisters of surveillance equipment.
[00:46:59.729 --> 00:47:00.669]  It's a silver blimp!
[00:47:02.029 --> 00:47:04.990]  But they go, no, that's not a Homeland Security blimp.
[00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:06.150]  That's a UFO.
[00:47:08.254 --> 00:47:10.596]  And then the public goes, okay, well it's aliens then.
[00:47:11.516 --> 00:47:13.457]  So we're analyzing this propaganda right now.
[00:47:14.058 --> 00:47:14.918]  So stay with us.
[00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:17.400]  You look at the blimp, we'll come back and talk about it when we get back.
[00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:31.358]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:47:31.518 --> 00:47:39.566]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[00:47:39.686 --> 00:47:40.006]  In fact,
[00:47:40.026 --> 00:47:44.187]  First, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:47:44.267 --> 00:47:46.888]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[00:47:47.028 --> 00:47:58.332]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:47:58.592 --> 00:48:04.795]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[00:48:05.035 --> 00:48:08.776]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an
[00:48:08.916 --> 00:48:11.778]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:48:11.798 --> 00:48:13.558]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:48:31.877 --> 00:48:32.918]  But who is the enemy?
[00:48:33.419 --> 00:48:33.919]  Bin Laden.
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.161]  This is his ammo.
[00:48:35.181 --> 00:48:36.523]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:48:36.563 --> 00:48:38.245]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:48:38.585 --> 00:48:45.353]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:48:45.733 --> 00:48:46.174]  Some U.S.
[00:48:46.214 --> 00:48:51.861]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:48:52.561 --> 00:48:56.044]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:48:56.064 --> 00:48:58.866]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:49:22.543 --> 00:49:24.425]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:24.985]  January 5th, 2009.
[00:49:25.085 --> 00:49:25.806]  Gold open this morning at $845.47.
[00:49:25.846 --> 00:49:28.768]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for $870.47, $435.23 for a half ounce, and $217.62 for a quarter ounce.
[00:49:28.788 --> 00:49:29.309]  That's $870.47, $435.23, and $217.62.
[00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:52.516]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:49:52.636 --> 00:49:55.718]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:49:55.798 --> 00:49:59.080]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.982]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:50:02.222 --> 00:50:04.983]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:50:05.043 --> 00:50:07.343]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:50:07.943 --> 00:50:10.124]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:50:10.244 --> 00:50:10.944]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:50:11.084 --> 00:50:16.826]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:50:16.846 --> 00:50:17.026]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:50:22.447 --> 00:50:23.949]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:50:24.129 --> 00:50:25.570]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:33.297]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:50:33.698 --> 00:50:36.540]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:51:28.399 --> 00:51:35.565]  Alright, if you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, we've been showing the news saying, is this a flying saucer?
[00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:37.347]  The government won't tell us.
[00:51:37.927 --> 00:51:41.550]  And so because the government won't tell them it's a blimp, they go, okay, it must be aliens.
[00:51:42.311 --> 00:51:49.037]  But I pulled up, punch up that MSNBC, the very article I saw five years ago from memory,
[00:51:50.097 --> 00:51:50.757]  We pulled it up.
[00:51:51.138 --> 00:51:52.519]  We googled Homeland Security blimps.
[00:51:52.579 --> 00:51:53.579]  It's Washington D.C.
[00:51:53.659 --> 00:51:58.242]  with a blimp above it, admitting that they're going to surveil the public with the blimp.
[00:52:00.063 --> 00:52:01.724]  I mean, it's just absolutely amazing.
[00:52:01.744 --> 00:52:02.105]  There it is.
[00:52:02.265 --> 00:52:03.786]  Eyes in the sky for Homeland Security.
[00:52:04.106 --> 00:52:06.808]  From blimps to do-it-yourself unmanned vehicles, a trend takes flight.
[00:52:07.388 --> 00:52:09.990]  And they say they're going to tether these blimps all over the United States.
[00:52:11.129 --> 00:52:16.334]  Some will be tethered, others will be super high altitude drones, and that's the larger ones you're seeing.
[00:52:16.614 --> 00:52:17.936]  And then the public looks at it.
[00:52:17.956 --> 00:52:21.839]  You can see the fins, the surveillance blisters of equipment.
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.442]  This is what's watching us, controlling us.
[00:52:25.002 --> 00:52:26.384]  It is doing face scans.
[00:52:26.404 --> 00:52:31.469]  That's the Bob Woodward super technology he's talking about, where it even knows your shadow and how you walk biometrically.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:35.301]  It's just incredible.
[00:52:35.341 --> 00:52:38.044]  Go ahead and play a little bit of that ABC News report where they're like, what is it?
[00:52:38.425 --> 00:52:39.205]  We don't know.
[00:52:39.706 --> 00:52:40.767]  Who knows what it is?
[00:52:40.807 --> 00:52:42.049]  And then we'll go to the caller from Chile.
[00:52:42.249 --> 00:52:42.629]  Here it is.
[00:52:47.535 --> 00:52:49.377]  What's hovering over Salt Lake City?
[00:52:49.457 --> 00:52:51.479]  Is it a rocket, a blimp, a UFO?
[00:52:52.378 --> 00:52:56.321]  A strange object seen in the skies has residents scratching their heads.
[00:52:56.421 --> 00:52:56.882]  It's a blimp!
[00:52:56.902 --> 00:53:00.485]  The craft floated overhead for several minutes before disappearing.
[00:53:01.065 --> 00:53:06.670]  Salt Lake Air traffic controllers said their radar didn't pick up anything and they have no knowledge of the craft.
[00:53:08.071 --> 00:53:08.832]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:53:09.492 --> 00:53:09.933]  That's enough.
[00:53:09.993 --> 00:53:18.420]  I mean, it's clearly a blimp, but because the government won't tell us, because the government lied to us and said that they don't see it, then we don't see it.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.862]  It must be aliens, because the government wouldn't lie.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.741]  I mean, and then, this is all over the news every day.
[00:53:24.761 --> 00:53:30.982]  These things are seen all over Texas, all over the country, and it's, oh, it's the cigar-shaped crap, it's the aliens.
[00:53:31.502 --> 00:53:35.763]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:53:36.043 --> 00:53:36.823]  It's a blimp.
[00:53:38.223 --> 00:53:40.944]  Bring it over here on the timeline where you can see even the back end of it.
[00:53:41.064 --> 00:53:42.664]  I mean, it is so clear.
[00:53:43.705 --> 00:53:44.845]  So clear that it's a blimp.
[00:53:45.125 --> 00:53:47.626]  And while we're looking at the blimp, let's go to Rob in Chile.
[00:53:47.946 --> 00:53:49.646]  Hey Rob, thanks for tuning in from Chile.
[00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:54.449]  Go ahead, Rob.
[00:53:54.489 --> 00:53:54.889]  Yes, sir.
[00:53:55.049 --> 00:53:55.329]  Yes, sir.
[00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.689]  Go ahead.
[00:53:55.729 --> 00:53:57.570]  What are you doing down in Chile?
[00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:06.732]  Well, my goal is to be a YouTube journalist to document what is happening down here, because Hugo Chavez is not a bad man.
[00:54:07.612 --> 00:54:08.172]  Not at all.
[00:54:08.633 --> 00:54:16.974]  And I know that I heard you interview Dr. William Pepper, and he told you that he's a good man.
[00:54:16.994 --> 00:54:18.995]  Well, are you in Venezuela or are you in Chile?
[00:54:19.878 --> 00:54:24.199]  No, right now I'm in Chile, but my goal is to be in Venezuela.
[00:54:24.279 --> 00:54:30.161]  I came here for a girlfriend, unfortunately, but I wanted to... I was in Denmark.
[00:54:30.401 --> 00:54:39.424]  I am an info warrior, and I was doing PowerPoint presentations, you know, with video and everything, in Denmark, and then they closed my school.
[00:54:40.024 --> 00:54:41.164]  A school that started in 1869.
[00:54:41.384 --> 00:54:44.125]  They closed it.
[00:54:45.725 --> 00:54:47.206]  I mean, it's just an amazing thing.
[00:54:48.978 --> 00:54:51.799]  Well, I mean, Hugo Chavez is shutting down some media.
[00:54:51.859 --> 00:54:56.983]  He is grabbing, you know, some corporations, some gold mines now, and I do think he's a little bit out of control.
[00:54:57.003 --> 00:55:03.627]  I mean, I think compared to, like, Stalin, he's not bad, but I mean, to me, it's got... Hold on, hold on.
[00:55:04.108 --> 00:55:05.689]  People always see this as good or bad.
[00:55:06.089 --> 00:55:06.269]  No.
[00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:09.251]  I mean, I see governments generally as being corrupt historically.
[00:55:09.271 --> 00:55:18.097]  You've got the corrupt New World Order that's the big monster, and you've got Chavez, who might have started out okay, but he's been doing some stuff I don't like, that I don't think he should be assassinated, like Pat Robertson says.
[00:55:19.018 --> 00:55:27.064]  Yeah, well, Pat Robertson is pleased as punch that Barack Obama is going to be the next president.
[00:55:27.145 --> 00:55:33.970]  Oh yeah, because he's going to warmonger and everything else and get left cover and steal lots of treasury money to give it to select bankers as corporate welfare.
[00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:36.733]  I want to tell you one story.
[00:55:36.753 --> 00:55:45.300]  I teach English and I was going to a place taking what they call a colectivo,
[00:55:45.822 --> 00:55:48.365]  A little car that takes about four people.
[00:55:48.865 --> 00:55:53.049]  And I'm sitting there with this woman who's very obviously poor.
[00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:57.754]  And, well, the mode of transportation is for poor people, generally.
[00:55:58.435 --> 00:56:00.697]  And she asked me where I was from.
[00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:02.059]  I told her from the States.
[00:56:02.119 --> 00:56:03.760]  Of course, all of this is in Spanish.
[00:56:04.261 --> 00:56:08.125]  And, you know, she's clearly very poor, and she's missing teeth and everything.
[00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:15.726]  And I tell her that I'm not, she asked me if I'm for Obama or McCain and I say, oh, I'm beyond all of that.
[00:56:15.866 --> 00:56:20.249]  You know, I left the States many years ago because of frustration.
[00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:21.050]  And what did she say?
[00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:21.790]  We're almost out of time.
[00:56:22.711 --> 00:56:25.192]  She said, um, do you know Alex Jones?
[00:56:25.753 --> 00:56:27.614]  And it just blew me away.
[00:56:27.734 --> 00:56:30.196]  Just completely blew my mind.
[00:56:30.236 --> 00:56:31.297]  I said, yes I do.
[00:56:31.397 --> 00:56:32.537]  You know Alex Jones?
[00:56:32.637 --> 00:56:36.180]  And she even knew that, um, uh,
[00:56:36.809 --> 00:56:40.977]  Prescott Bush was born in Columbus, Ohio, which is where I was born.
[00:56:41.756 --> 00:56:43.657]  And, I mean, that just blew my mind.
[00:56:43.738 --> 00:56:44.958]  So the word is getting out.
[00:56:45.078 --> 00:56:48.701]  I have no idea, because she didn't speak any English.
[00:56:49.001 --> 00:56:51.623]  So how she managed to do this, I don't know.
[00:56:51.743 --> 00:56:53.684]  But the word is spreading down here.
[00:57:12.656 --> 00:57:13.557]  We're on the march.
[00:57:14.037 --> 00:57:15.657]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:57:16.577 --> 00:57:19.358]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:22.559 --> 00:57:24.580]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:27.100]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.761]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:57:29.781 --> 00:57:30.921]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:57:30.941 --> 00:57:32.582]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:57:32.662 --> 00:57:35.122]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:57:35.342 --> 00:57:40.884]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, and the Center?
[00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:53.636]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:57:53.696 --> 00:57:54.777]  An inside job.
[00:57:57.492 --> 00:57:58.613]  How dare you?
[00:58:00.114 --> 00:58:04.999]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:58:05.019 --> 00:58:07.801]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:14.326]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:58:14.386 --> 00:58:16.969]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:58:17.229 --> 00:58:19.191]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:58:19.471 --> 00:58:21.953]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:58:23.064 --> 00:58:25.226]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[00:58:25.726 --> 00:58:30.309]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with the reflective spray.
[00:58:30.769 --> 00:58:32.630]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:33.871]  We are under the microscope.
[00:58:34.051 --> 00:58:37.894]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[00:58:38.054 --> 00:58:41.456]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.
[00:58:41.716 --> 00:58:44.798]  Have a fighting chance with SprayYourPlate.com's Photoblocker.
[00:58:44.978 --> 00:58:50.942]  When properly applied, this revolutionary product has proven itself to be the most effective device available against traffic cameras.
[00:58:51.182 --> 00:58:56.386]  Invisible to the naked eye, your license plate, when flashed, will be overexposed and unreadable to the cameras.
[00:58:56.626 --> 00:58:57.227]  Save your money!
[00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:59.008]  Go to SprayYourPlate.com.
[00:58:59.128 --> 00:59:00.869]  That's SprayYourPlate.com.

[00:59:07.093 --> 00:59:09.395]  Go to SprayYourPlate.com or call 1-800-276-9601.
[00:59:12.717 --> 00:59:13.219]  That's 1-800-276-9601.
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:17.869]  Don't give your money to the state.
[00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:18.651]  Spray your plate.
[00:59:18.952 --> 00:59:21.097]  And when the cameras flash, you'll save some cash.
[00:59:22.452 --> 00:59:25.714]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:59:25.894 --> 00:59:29.977]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:59:30.157 --> 00:59:41.584]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:59:41.804 --> 00:59:47.648]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:59:47.708 --> 00:59:48.048]  I think so.
[01:00:11.648 --> 01:00:21.690]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A Silver dot com or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[01:00:26.551 --> 01:00:28.811]  We're here live Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[01:00:28.851 --> 01:00:29.471]  to 3 p.m.
[01:00:29.911 --> 01:00:31.132]  Central Standard Time.
[01:00:32.552 --> 01:00:38.073]  Then it's retransmitted on AM and FM stations, global shortwaves throughout the day and evening and morning.
[01:00:39.417 --> 01:00:48.282]  And of course, always pumping out the truth with over 120,000 people a day downloading the free podcast and growing by about 5,000 a week at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:49.542 --> 01:00:52.444]  Then it's copied to YouTube, Google, videos all over the world.
[01:00:52.464 --> 01:00:54.044]  People put images to the radio show.
[01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:59.987]  We're trying to step it up, everybody, by putting our own images over the radio show for the visual folks.
[01:01:00.027 --> 01:01:06.511]  People are taking the videos and translating them into Spanish, German, into French, into Chinese.
[01:01:07.799 --> 01:01:08.579]  In Japanese.
[01:01:08.759 --> 01:01:09.460]  Very, very exciting.
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.980]  I want to thank all those out there.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.701]  It's a team effort in the InfoWar to see the big picture, the larger paradigm.
[01:01:14.721 --> 01:01:22.364]  We're going to go to just an amazing guest, Dr. Russell Blaylock for the balance of the show today and open the phones up coming up in the next hour.
[01:01:22.384 --> 01:01:23.784]  You can pretty much get into any issue.
[01:01:23.804 --> 01:01:31.507]  I know some of you have been holding a while, but mainly we're talking about Alzheimer's, all these brain diseases that 35, 40-year-olds are getting now.
[01:01:32.347 --> 01:01:32.988]  What Fluoride
[01:01:47.227 --> 01:01:49.269]  You hear me endorse for the sponsors I believe in.
[01:01:49.469 --> 01:01:54.432]  The network has some of its own, and they're all fine and dandy, but these are the ones I've researched, I believe in, and I'm pushing.
[01:01:54.813 --> 01:02:01.078]  And efoodsdirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens Group, is the best price, the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[01:02:01.138 --> 01:02:01.858]  They ship quickly.
[01:02:02.238 --> 01:02:03.359]  It's non-GMO food.
[01:02:03.439 --> 01:02:10.184]  Everything but the bananas is grown right here in the United States, and it's just the highest quality, lasts more than 10 years, and climate controlled.
[01:02:10.945 --> 01:02:14.048]  Ten years in non-climate controlled, like your garage or attic.
[01:02:14.729 --> 01:02:16.371]  And this is where I've gotten my starvable foods.
[01:02:16.391 --> 01:02:18.253]  That's why I went out and approached them about being sponsors.
[01:02:18.633 --> 01:02:22.197]  Because I bought from other companies and I ended up testing it out and I like theirs the best.
[01:02:23.564 --> 01:02:26.907]  And their toll-free number to call and get a free brochure, a free audio CD, or to learn more is 800-409-5633.
[01:02:26.927 --> 01:02:26.987]  800-409-5633.
[01:02:27.027 --> 01:02:31.932]  If you forget the website or the phone number, which again is 800-409-5633, you can go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and there's big fat banners there.
[01:02:43.803 --> 01:03:00.372]  And going into these uncertain times, more than ever, people need to be prepared and need to protect themselves and be self-sufficient with water filters, firearms, gold and silver, and of course, have good friends and family to work with in what looks like is going to be a global depression orchestrated by the private central banks to bring in their world governments.
[01:03:00.392 --> 01:03:05.995]  So, efoodsdirect.com, we salute them and thank them for making this broadcast possible.
[01:03:06.895 --> 01:03:10.702]  Also, another sponsor that goes well with preparedness is acolablue.com.
[01:03:11.203 --> 01:03:14.849]  Acolablue is the best water generator and we looked at a whole bunch of them.
[01:03:15.885 --> 01:03:17.465]  Not just the best quality, but the best price.
[01:03:17.805 --> 01:03:24.307]  And then it goes through five filters and two sub-filters, so a total of seven, after it grabs the water out of the air.
[01:03:24.727 --> 01:03:30.148]  You can be in your house, your office, your back porch, and the average weather, average humidity, it gets about seven and a half gallons.
[01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:31.948]  Even in the driest deserts, more than three gallons.
[01:03:32.629 --> 01:03:35.029]  There's water everywhere.
[01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:36.409]  In the air we breathe.
[01:03:36.449 --> 01:03:37.490]  In the air that's all around us.
[01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:39.150]  That's what clouds are.
[01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:40.310]  And acolablue.com.
[01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:42.011]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[01:03:42.071 --> 01:03:43.451]  Atmospheric water generator for your home.
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.444]  Great tasting pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[01:03:47.504 --> 01:03:48.865]  No chemicals, pollutants or toxins.
[01:03:49.366 --> 01:03:50.427]  Neutral pH.
[01:03:51.008 --> 01:03:51.468]  Ecolablue.com or 866-585-4044.
[01:03:51.488 --> 01:03:51.528]  866-585-4044.
[01:03:51.548 --> 01:03:52.550]  And one more plug here.
[01:04:00.805 --> 01:04:16.257]  Remember, everybody's hurting in this economy, and I know you're hurting in this economy, but for us to continue at the level we're at, or hopefully expand in this fight against the globalists to educate our fellow public worldwide, I can think of no better place to support than InfoWars.com and this radio show slash TV show.
[01:04:17.057 --> 01:04:22.021]  And you support us by getting the books and videos from a secure online shopping cart at InfoWars.com.

[01:04:47.526 --> 01:04:50.027]  This is an award-winning film.
[01:04:50.067 --> 01:04:52.608]  I mean, this is better than Discovery Channel quality.
[01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:55.229]  We have it discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:04:55.649 --> 01:04:57.230]  Books like The Resistance Manifesto,
[01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:01.894]  True Christian Conservatism with Hardcore Info from Mark Dice.
[01:05:02.474 --> 01:05:02.955]  We have that.
[01:05:03.355 --> 01:05:07.239]  Fabled Enemies, what really happened on 9-11, Jason Burma's newest film that I produced.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.363]  This film, three and a half hours long, 1995, The Money Masters.
[01:05:11.643 --> 01:05:14.846]  You want to have a master's degree on who rules the planet and who our real enemy is?

[01:05:27.917 --> 01:05:41.180]  And for a few more weeks, and we're cutting it off, we have the New Year's special, extending the Christmas special, five plus months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv to get the live feed, all my films in super high quality online, burn them to disk, DVD, give them to people.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:45.204]  Thousands of special TV reports I've done going back almost five years.
[01:05:45.244 --> 01:05:58.459]  In April it will be five years of PrisonPlanet.TV and I also want to thank all the members of PrisonPlanet.TV for making this radio show and everything we do here possible and so we just keep expanding everything that PrisonPlanet.TV offers and we're about to redesign the site next month.
[01:05:58.979 --> 01:06:01.862]  It'll have all the thousands of pieces of media indexed better.
[01:06:02.342 --> 01:06:07.066]  Some of the older films that were put in there years ago in lower quality, we're going to upload those in the highest quality.
[01:06:07.386 --> 01:06:08.908]  All the new stuff's in super high quality.
[01:06:09.308 --> 01:06:16.274]  We're really going to upgrade it and it's going to be a system where you can post comments and a lot more at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:16.294 --> 01:06:17.415]  So we just keep improving that.
[01:06:17.435 --> 01:06:19.137]  We appreciate all of you supporting us.
[01:06:19.817 --> 01:06:24.041]  That said, I really appreciate him joining us for the next hour and twenty-something minutes.
[01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:27.864]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is a board-certified neurosurgeon, author, and lecturer.
[01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:37.431]  He attended the LSU School of Medicine, New Orleans, and completed his general surgical internship and neurosurgical residency at the Medical Center of South Carolina in Charleston.
[01:06:37.872 --> 01:06:40.033]  During his residency, he ran the neurology program for
[01:06:40.714 --> 01:06:40.994]  I think so.
[01:07:03.544 --> 01:07:04.645]  I hope I'm pronouncing this right.
[01:07:05.766 --> 01:07:10.269]  Colosol, a removal of intravascular tumors which is still used today.
[01:07:10.289 --> 01:07:15.753]  Dr. Blaylock presented these cases utilizing the technique to the Congress of Neurosurgical Surgeons.
[01:07:16.174 --> 01:07:17.435]  Folks, it goes on for page after page.
[01:07:17.455 --> 01:07:30.865]  He's one of the top now retired brain surgeons in the world and he's done a lot of studies and reads every day all the other major studies about what these toxins in our environment are doing and ways to not ingest all those.
[01:07:30.885 --> 01:07:31.986]  I have a lot of questions today.
[01:07:33.097 --> 01:07:39.602]  You know, there's a video making the rounds on YouTube, a little three-minute rant I did, where this caller calls in and can't talk.
[01:07:40.142 --> 01:07:41.603]  And he's saying, I'm a liar about the U.S.
[01:07:41.623 --> 01:07:42.403]  bringing Nazis in.
[01:07:42.423 --> 01:07:43.484]  And I said, but it's all over the news.
[01:07:43.764 --> 01:07:47.307]  And folks have put articles about that, you know, up over me talking.
[01:07:48.328 --> 01:07:54.072]  And I make the point, I say, sir, depending on the studies, 15 to 30 percent brain size reduction, not being breastfed.
[01:07:54.092 --> 01:07:55.713]  And he got real mad about that.
[01:07:55.753 --> 01:07:57.114]  But, I mean, that's just one other little area.
[01:07:58.584 --> 01:08:02.607]  There's so much I want to talk to him about, and I'm very thankful for him joining us.
[01:08:03.228 --> 01:08:05.349]  And Dr. Blaylock, it's so good to have you here with us.
[01:08:05.909 --> 01:08:06.410]  Well, thank you.
[01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:07.931]  It's a pleasure being on your program.
[01:08:08.311 --> 01:08:08.571]  You bet.
[01:08:08.591 --> 01:08:09.992]  Thank you for sitting through my plugs.
[01:08:11.473 --> 01:08:17.617]  Out of the gates, tell folks about your books, your videos, your materials, your websites, here at the very start of the show for people that want to learn more.
[01:08:18.978 --> 01:08:24.341]  Well, my website is www.russellblaylockmd.com.
[01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:25.962]  That's the r-u-s-s-e-l-l-m-d.
[01:08:27.455 --> 01:08:30.598]  B-L-A-Y-L-O-C-K-M-D dot com.
[01:08:31.318 --> 01:08:34.160]  And it has a section of free information.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:43.147]  It's, you know, I write papers about anything from mercury toxicity, vaccines, cholesterol, nonsense.
[01:08:44.208 --> 01:08:53.996]  And I have a paper on regimentation in medicine and the death of creativity, which people would be interested in if they're interested in the fact of collectivism on medicine.
[01:08:55.058 --> 01:09:19.969]  And I have some DVDs on nutrition and behavior, which talks about the effects of nutrition on how people think, as well as criminality, suicide risk, all of these things that we're hearing in the news today about our young people being uncontrollable and the direct connection to diet.
[01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:23.310]  And what you could do about it is discussed on this DVD.
[01:09:25.486 --> 01:09:34.211]  I have a newsletter that's published through Newsmax.com, the Blalock Wellness Report, which is a monthly report.
[01:09:34.271 --> 01:09:36.312]  I update all the things on nutrition.
[01:09:37.233 --> 01:09:48.419]  And I have several books, Excited Toxins, The Taste That Kills was the original book, and it's about MSG and aspartame toxicity to the brain and nervous system.
[01:09:49.235 --> 01:10:04.407]  And then a general nutrition book, it's more recent, it's Health and Nutrition Secrets That Can Save Your Life, which covers all sorts of subjects, vaccination, fluoride, mercury toxicity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, a lot of different subjects.
[01:10:05.428 --> 01:10:06.829]  And it's very comprehensive.
[01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:17.178]  The third book is Natural Strategies for Cancer Patients, in which I reviewed a world of studies on nutrition and cancer suppression.
[01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:30.939]  It goes through how to not only use it primarily to treat cancers of various kinds, but also how it enhances the effectiveness of what's considered traditional cancer treatment and makes them less toxic.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.142]  But these are two recent books, the last two.
[01:10:36.363 --> 01:10:39.525]  The Tritotoxin book was updated in 1997, I think it was.
[01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:48.139]  And it's all available at your website that we have up on screen for everybody watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:55.708]  You know, just while you were talking there for a minute or two, Obama, the major changes, if they haven't taken over medicine already, now they're openly announcing it.
[01:10:56.009 --> 01:10:59.333]  I want to get into what SSRIs, just the toxicity alone, is doing.
[01:10:59.913 --> 01:11:00.173]  Thank you.
[01:11:21.972 --> 01:11:27.374]  Well, I think what I need to probably start with is a discussion of how we came to what we call orthodox medicine in the United States.
[01:11:27.414 --> 01:11:28.795]  Because it's a source of great confusion.
[01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:58.795]  Are now inundated with the idea of whether it's orthodox medicine, which is what we traditionally think of medicine, and accepted.
[01:11:58.855 --> 01:12:03.638]  And then we have people working outside of orthodox medicine, which is sort of frowned on.
[01:12:03.698 --> 01:12:09.602]  That's the people doing nutrition, vitamins, minerals, herbs, uses, etc.
[01:12:10.763 --> 01:12:16.226]  And so you need to kind of understand, well, who created orthodox medicine?
[01:12:16.266 --> 01:12:17.147]  Where did that come from?
[01:12:18.106 --> 01:12:22.049]  Well, it actually came from the Rockefeller Foundation back in 1901.
[01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:31.837]  The Rockefellers, at the time, their family, because of the Standard Oil scandal, no one wanted to be called a Rockefeller.
[01:12:31.857 --> 01:12:33.538]  Everybody hated all the Rockefellers.
[01:12:34.839 --> 01:12:39.783]  And so his friend, Reverend Gates, went to John D. Rockefeller, Sr.
[01:12:39.803 --> 01:12:44.887]  and told him, said, well, here's a way we can repair your reputation.
[01:12:44.967 --> 01:12:47.048]  And he gave him a good example.
[01:12:47.088 --> 01:12:47.849]  There was this man,
[01:12:48.616 --> 01:12:52.258]  Uh, who everybody hated, uh, just like, you know, they were hating you.
[01:12:53.138 --> 01:12:59.362]  And he started giving money out for, uh, all sorts of, uh, philanthropic, uh, uh, enterprise.
[01:12:59.582 --> 01:13:01.643]  And soon people forgot all of the bad things.
[01:13:02.283 --> 01:13:05.505]  All they remembered was this philanthropy that he was pouring out.
[01:13:05.525 --> 01:13:07.546]  And he said, so what, that's what we need to do with you.
[01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:17.491]  And so the first thing, because, uh, Gates' father was a physician, and John D. Rockefeller's father was a quack, uh, uh, snake oil salesman.
[01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:22.294]  He said, let's form the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research.
[01:13:23.035 --> 01:13:25.097]  And so they created this in 1901.
[01:13:26.038 --> 01:13:29.241]  And so Rockefeller owned what was called the Drug Trust.
[01:13:30.162 --> 01:13:33.245]  That's the major drug manufacturing firms all over the world.
[01:13:33.345 --> 01:13:40.092]  Merck, Pharmaceutical, Blatterly, all of these drug pharmaceutical companies.
[01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:49.298]  Because the Rockefellers understood taking over an entire industry and controlling the education system is the key to dominating societies.
[01:13:49.338 --> 01:13:50.339]  These are monopoly men.
[01:13:50.939 --> 01:13:54.703]  Right, and he also made himself a lot of money, and that's what Gates pointed out to him.
[01:13:54.743 --> 01:14:09.615]  Not only can we present this as philanthropy, but by promoting only drugs and the treatments that you promote as being so-called orthodox, that'll feed back into the companies that you own.
[01:14:10.347 --> 01:14:13.209]  And of course, what he did, he didn't always directly own companies.
[01:14:13.289 --> 01:14:15.370]  He would buy enough shares that he controlled them.
[01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:18.492]  Yeah, it's very simple for people who don't understand what you're saying.
[01:14:18.512 --> 01:14:19.793]  This is all part of the mainline history.
[01:14:19.893 --> 01:14:23.094]  It isn't taught in the mainline textbooks, but it is there for those that want to know.
[01:14:23.735 --> 01:14:30.078]  They took over the education system in medicine to then direct the course of it into their own companies.
[01:14:31.059 --> 01:14:39.604]  Right, and the way he took over the medical education system at the time, he hired a person called Abraham Flexner.
[01:14:40.716 --> 01:14:49.439]  And he told him what we need to do is have you study the medical schools in the United States and write a critique of it.
[01:14:50.699 --> 01:15:00.942]  And of course, the aim was to remove all nutrition references to nutritional type treatments from the medical school.
[01:15:00.982 --> 01:15:04.283]  So they closed down half the medical schools in the United States.
[01:15:04.303 --> 01:15:06.664]  There were 165 medical schools at the time.
[01:15:07.164 --> 01:15:08.384]  Well, he closed half of them.
[01:15:08.939 --> 01:15:23.213]  Then he had his anointed medical school, which he poured his money into, appointed the professors from his own stock of professors, and so they created an educational system that taught the things that he wanted taught.
[01:15:24.674 --> 01:15:29.219]  And therefore, every professor that came out of those programs taught the same thing.
[01:15:29.259 --> 01:15:30.460]  So you established
[01:15:31.778 --> 01:15:36.161]  An orthodox training system where everybody was saying the same thing.
[01:15:36.501 --> 01:15:38.362]  Yeah, they call it now standardization.
[01:15:38.382 --> 01:15:51.589]  It's like international bodies fund every county and city and fly around the city managers and social planners, where now all the zoning's the same, or the schools are the same, or the anti-gun message is the same, or the anti-sovereignty message.
[01:15:51.929 --> 01:15:57.852]  Everything is standardized, so this all goes back to them doing this with banking, and then medicine, and then energy.
[01:15:58.013 --> 01:15:58.653]  Please continue.
[01:15:59.264 --> 01:16:03.406]  Right, and if you look at the history of it, it all stemmed from Rockefeller.
[01:16:03.426 --> 01:16:13.412]  He did this in all of the segments that you've discussed, including the municipalities and the cities and villages, so that he controlled their governments as well.
[01:16:13.852 --> 01:16:21.216]  Well, he now has absolute control of all of medical care in the United States, as well as it moved out into the world.
[01:16:21.256 --> 01:16:22.597]  He made it international.
[01:16:22.822 --> 01:16:32.568]  And then when they have control of medicine, they can cover up by compartmentalizing and giving false data to the doctors who are compartmentalized and scientists.
[01:16:32.808 --> 01:16:38.092]  They can cover up their eugenics program to make sure that real doctors and scientists don't ever discover it, correct?
[01:16:39.092 --> 01:16:42.334]  Right, and the thing is, Lily Kay wrote a book on this.
[01:16:42.354 --> 01:16:48.478]  It's the history of molecular medicine and the connection to Rockefeller Foundation and Caltech.
[01:16:49.475 --> 01:16:51.577]  It's a very in-depth history of it.
[01:16:51.597 --> 01:17:00.664]  She's a professor of history, very well qualified, and has a very highly acclaimed history of molecular medicine and molecular biology.
[01:17:01.224 --> 01:17:18.717]  But in it, she makes the point that the Rockefeller Foundation created molecular biology with the aim of human engineering and social control, and that his goal was to eliminate people in the world who he felt was unfit
[01:17:19.498 --> 01:17:26.564]  for life, and to change the minds and the thinking of people by using molecular biology.
[01:17:26.584 --> 01:17:29.807]  And then he pioneered the funding with the British of Mind War.
[01:17:30.107 --> 01:17:31.788]  That's what Hitler called it, or propaganda.
[01:17:32.869 --> 01:17:33.290]  Right.
[01:17:33.370 --> 01:17:35.051]  He turned it international in 1950.
[01:17:35.511 --> 01:17:47.301]  What he did, he turned the domestic program over to Ford Foundation, and then he went international, mainly concentrating in Britain with their program of psychological warfare and psychological
[01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:50.006]  Changing of thinking and mind.
[01:18:08.246 --> 01:18:09.548]  This is what's really going on.
[01:18:09.829 --> 01:18:11.191]  They're poisoning you by design.
[01:18:11.211 --> 01:18:12.013]  We're going to get to that.
[01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:15.379]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is our guest, an amazing individual.
[01:18:15.619 --> 01:18:17.042]  We're so honored to have him with us.
[01:18:17.342 --> 01:18:19.927]  We're going to come back and continue with What Rules Our World.
[01:18:19.967 --> 01:18:20.387]  Stay with us.
[01:18:22.284 --> 01:18:27.926]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:18:28.126 --> 01:18:33.268]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:18:33.548 --> 01:18:38.630]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:42.491]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:18:42.791 --> 01:18:44.492]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[01:18:44.832 --> 01:18:50.815]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:18:51.055 --> 01:18:54.577]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:18:54.837 --> 01:18:59.380]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:00.440]  Do your part.
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.982]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:09.445]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[01:19:09.885 --> 01:19:14.429]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:15.910]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:19:31.497 --> 01:19:32.338]  Who is the enemy?
[01:19:32.858 --> 01:19:33.359]  Bin Laden.
[01:19:33.659 --> 01:19:34.640]  This is his ammo.
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.001]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:37.682]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:19:38.022 --> 01:19:44.768]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:19:45.168 --> 01:19:45.608]  Some U.S.
[01:19:45.648 --> 01:19:51.333]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:19:51.993 --> 01:19:55.534]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:19:55.874 --> 01:20:05.738]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:20:05.978 --> 01:20:06.718]  Fabled enemies.

[01:21:26.491 --> 01:21:29.834]  I want everybody out there watching to listen to me very carefully.
[01:21:30.794 --> 01:21:41.803]  Everything Dr. Blaylock, neurosurgeon, researcher, lecturer, peer-reviewed publisher, is telling you is on the historical record.
[01:21:41.843 --> 01:21:45.566]  The eugenicists developed their plans in the 1850s.
[01:21:45.606 --> 01:21:49.088]  They took them into governmental control by the 1930s.
[01:21:49.188 --> 01:21:50.009]  They implemented it.
[01:21:50.349 --> 01:21:52.231]  The Nazis were just a spin-off of that.
[01:21:54.315 --> 01:21:56.682]  That's why all this is happening.
[01:21:56.722 --> 01:21:58.868]  That's why the poisoning of the population is happening.
[01:21:59.889 --> 01:22:01.410]  And they've got one comeback to all this.
[01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:05.613]  They say, well, population, you know, we're living longer in the United States.
[01:22:05.634 --> 01:22:06.374]  Well, that's not true.
[01:22:06.995 --> 01:22:08.676]  Infant mortality is way down.
[01:22:09.036 --> 01:22:18.504]  So if you take out infant mortality old numbers, on average, depending on the decade, but going back 60, 70, 80, 100 years ago, 30, 40 percent of children would die by the age of five.
[01:22:18.524 --> 01:22:20.765]  If you take those numbers out, we aren't living as long.
[01:22:20.785 --> 01:22:21.266]  Look at Russia.
[01:22:21.286 --> 01:22:22.487]  They're living like 52 now.
[01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:26.130]  This is going on by design, by the social planners.
[01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:29.492]  So, Dr. Blaylock, please continue.
[01:22:29.532 --> 01:22:31.133]  You had gotten to 1950.
[01:22:31.193 --> 01:22:33.254]  They go totally international with it.
[01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:34.575]  Please continue.
[01:22:35.496 --> 01:22:55.028]  Well, as I said, they turned over the domestic behavioral sciences to the Ford Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation and its Carnegie Corporate Foundation turned their attention to the international arena to promote this social engineering
[01:22:55.889 --> 01:23:11.594]  What Rockefeller 1920 coined the science of man, basically it was eugenic, because he was funding the majority of the eugenic organizations in the world in the 1910-1920 period.
[01:23:12.914 --> 01:23:16.475]  Well, the Ford Foundation essentially is controlled by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:23:16.595 --> 01:23:21.277]  Virtually all the major foundations are controlled by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:23:21.397 --> 01:23:23.938]  The way they did that is they had their
[01:23:25.819 --> 01:23:30.585]  People put in as trustees of these other foundations and eventually they took over control.
[01:23:31.166 --> 01:23:37.534]  So by interlocking most of the major foundations, now the Bill Gates Foundation,
[01:23:38.231 --> 01:23:43.032]  is directly and indirectly controlled by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:23:43.052 --> 01:23:45.852]  Now let me bring up the sources on that.
[01:23:45.872 --> 01:23:53.694]  The church hearings in Congress, as you know, in the seventies, went into the interlocking directorates and the different foundations.
[01:23:54.214 --> 01:24:04.716]  And another way the Rockefellers, by controlling government, if they didn't like a foundation or they didn't play ball, they could stick regulators on them to selectively enforce rules to break them up or bring them under Rockefeller-allied control.
[01:24:04.736 --> 01:24:05.036]  Go ahead.
[01:24:06.226 --> 01:24:14.710]  Right, and by regulating and controlling most of the major foundations, then they could have block grants, which they did.
[01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:19.493]  They directed their projects together toward a certain type of research.
[01:24:19.533 --> 01:24:27.417]  For instance, they were very interested in behaviorism, which is psychological control in human engineering, psychobiology.
[01:24:28.417 --> 01:24:35.961]  So by using that mass block of money, the other foundations were just very small and of no consequence.
[01:24:37.288 --> 01:24:44.074]  But they train these physicians in the United States by targeting certain institutions.
[01:24:44.134 --> 01:24:53.182]  For instance, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Duke University, University of Wisconsin were targeted to be their institutions, Caltech.
[01:24:53.863 --> 01:25:02.551]  And so they filled it with their people, with their agenda, their social planning agenda and social control agenda.
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:10.184]  And these people eventually became professors as well, or sent their students as professors in the foreign countries.
[01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:20.511]  So over the period of time since 1901, they've essentially taken over most of the major universities throughout the world through this interlocking directory.
[01:25:21.131 --> 01:25:27.315]  Now, to show how much money these people have, they did something that was even more powerful, and that is
[01:25:27.745 --> 01:25:34.228]  They made sure their people became the advisors for the government when the government was giving out money for these things.
[01:25:34.848 --> 01:25:42.512]  Because the psychological program funding by the federal government far exceeded the foundations in the 1950s and 60s.
[01:25:43.132 --> 01:25:47.474]  But it was the foundations that controlled the various governmental groups
[01:25:48.478 --> 01:25:50.199]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:27:17.446 --> 01:27:20.228]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:29.770 --> 01:27:34.296]  Our guest, Dr. Russell Blaylock, is giving you the basic crash course in brain surgery and understanding
[01:27:44.588 --> 01:27:49.433]  How our society is governed, how the map makers of the mind are controlling our society.
[01:27:49.453 --> 01:27:57.042]  Then we're going to go into what they're building, the eugenics operation, the population reduction operation they're carrying out against you and your family.
[01:27:57.603 --> 01:27:59.865]  Whether you're an FBI agent, a police officer, a bureaucrat.
[01:27:59.885 --> 01:28:05.872]  And we're going to get into some of the specific toxins and poisons that have been introduced into our environment.
[01:28:07.469 --> 01:28:08.869]  This is a quick segment.
[01:28:09.389 --> 01:28:14.110]  We're going to come back in a long segment coming up in about five minutes, but let's continue with Dr. Blaylock.
[01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:15.951]  Dr. Blaylock, please continue.
[01:28:18.171 --> 01:28:29.533]  Yeah, and continuing that line of their obsession with this science of changing the human behavior and what we call eventually behaviorism in the 1948-50 period.
[01:28:33.845 --> 01:28:37.629]  For instance, in 1928, at Cal Tech, they had a biology division.
[01:28:37.649 --> 01:28:44.014]  That's where Rockefeller first was funneling his money to create this science of man idea.
[01:28:44.034 --> 01:28:50.120]  It was focused on eugenics, according to Dr. May.
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:58.087]  She said that one of the professors there, Ezra Gosney, was in fact a leader in the eugenic movement.
[01:28:59.068 --> 01:29:11.371]  In the American Eugenics Society, the American Social Hygiene Society, Eugenics Research Association, and the Human Betterment Society, which was heavily funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:29:12.351 --> 01:29:25.514]  And they mailed out tens of thousands of brochures to doctors, teachers, social workers, physicians, university publishers, all these different organizations to make sure that these ideas were
[01:29:26.392 --> 01:29:29.634]  Uh, in the minds of the American public and acceptable.
[01:29:30.494 --> 01:29:51.866]  And, uh, just to give you an idea of one of the things that this, uh, Dr. Gosney wrote in Scientific American 1934, he was urging his readers to embrace, uh, Adolph Lorenz, uh, professor of sociology in Vienna, uh, with the idea that sterilization of the unfit would eventually reach all civilized countries.
[01:29:52.532 --> 01:29:55.993]  As a means, quote, of getting rid of the scum of humanity.
[01:29:57.393 --> 01:30:00.835]  So this was a person who was in the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:30:01.735 --> 01:30:08.157]  He was appointed as a professor of this new biology program, molecular biology program at Caltech.
[01:30:08.657 --> 01:30:17.119]  And he had a tremendous influence in training of professors that were teaching other biologists and eventually physicians as well.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.341]  Now just to give you some of the quotes she gives in the book to show you that this is
[01:30:22.748 --> 01:30:24.609]  Something I'm pulling out of thin air.
[01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:31.113]  In her book, she says, in the 1920s, Rockefeller conceived the idea of the science of man agenda.
[01:30:32.354 --> 01:30:45.002]  And she says, quote, the motivation behind the enormous investment was to develop human sciences as a comprehensive and applied framework of social control grounded in natural, medical, and social sciences.
[01:30:46.343 --> 01:30:48.444]  Its aim was toward human engineering.
[01:30:49.266 --> 01:30:55.708]  The conjunction of cognitive and social goals had a strong historical connection to eugenics.
[01:30:55.788 --> 01:30:58.309]  So, you know, you can't make any plan.
[01:30:58.329 --> 01:31:06.932]  There's just quote after quote through the book, in which he keeps saying over and over, his entire plan for this funding was not benevolent.
[01:31:07.052 --> 01:31:17.455]  It was to control human beings in the way they would think, to control human thought, and to get rid of people that he considered undesirable.
[01:31:17.616 --> 01:31:18.896]  Well, he had all the money
[01:31:19.463 --> 01:31:31.091]  At his disposal were from Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Lawrence Bellman Rockefeller Memorial, the Ford Foundation, so he had a massive amount of foundation money.
[01:31:31.511 --> 01:31:44.720]  In addition, as being advisors to the federal government, all of the money that the government was spending in these areas, which was much greater than even the foundation, was controlled by the foundation itself.
[01:31:45.301 --> 01:31:46.782]  So, eventually, today,
[01:31:47.358 --> 01:31:52.283]  They have the wealth of the entire world at their disposal to carry out these programs.
[01:31:52.984 --> 01:32:05.918]  We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars over this planet to promote, and she even mentions, New World Order, which you said they helped design with the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:32:06.621 --> 01:32:09.202]  So all of these things are well documented.
[01:32:09.382 --> 01:32:13.163]  It's not just something that you are making up like this.
[01:32:13.723 --> 01:32:15.024]  And doctor, it's horrifying.
[01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:18.585]  We've got a break, quick break, long segment coming up, sir.
[01:32:18.605 --> 01:32:19.825]  And it's just horrifying.
[01:32:20.105 --> 01:32:21.626]  This is planet eugenics.
[01:32:21.686 --> 01:32:27.768]  This is... How would you like to save up to 90% on your phone bill?
[01:32:29.168 --> 01:32:31.549]  It can be done thanks to Empire One Telecom.

[01:33:22.369 --> 01:33:28.773]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:33:29.153 --> 01:33:31.115]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:33:31.795 --> 01:33:32.816]  But who is the enemy?
[01:33:33.336 --> 01:33:33.856]  Bin Laden.
[01:33:34.137 --> 01:33:35.037]  This is his ammo.
[01:33:35.057 --> 01:33:36.478]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:33:36.518 --> 01:33:38.179]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:33:38.499 --> 01:33:45.244]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:33:45.644 --> 01:33:46.084]  Some U.S.
[01:33:46.124 --> 01:33:51.768]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:33:52.468 --> 01:33:56.010]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:33:56.350 --> 01:34:06.214]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:34:06.434 --> 01:34:07.195]  Fabled enemies.

[01:34:23.442 --> 01:34:24.483]  Hello, I'm Steve Schenk.
[01:34:25.223 --> 01:34:28.526]  Many have been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election.
[01:34:29.066 --> 01:34:35.591]  The inauguration, not the election, is the deadline given by the Obama insiders for completing your food supplies.
[01:34:36.271 --> 01:34:48.079]  Joe Biden and Colin Powell both stated that shortly after the inauguration, possibly the 21st or 22nd of January, the new president would be forced by an international incident to make some unpopular decisions.
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:52.963]  This functions as an important deadline for getting any food you intend to have.
[01:34:53.584 --> 01:35:00.666]  The unpopular presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of transportation and availability of food distribution.
[01:35:01.606 --> 01:35:06.627]  Order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before the inauguration to allow for shipping.
[01:35:07.227 --> 01:35:11.248]  Late orders cannot be guaranteed delivery by this deadline for disaster.
[01:35:11.768 --> 01:35:13.148]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[01:35:22.279 --> 01:35:27.333]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:27.694 --> 01:35:29.980]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:34.227]  This is your life we're talking about here.
[01:35:35.128 --> 01:35:41.010]  This is the medical institutions, the colleges, the cities, the counties, all social engineering.
[01:35:41.911 --> 01:35:54.317]  Now the banks, by design, their own documents, we've covered here at Nauseam, are imploding the economy by design to where you literally have to have a government job or work for a company being financed by the internationalists.
[01:35:55.239 --> 01:36:00.105]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is our guest, and coming up at the bottom of the hour, we're going to open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:36:00.125 --> 01:36:00.185]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:36:00.205 --> 01:36:00.426]  Dr. Blaylock.
[01:36:09.949 --> 01:36:11.070]  We're continuing with the history here.
[01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:16.573]  I want to get into now what they're setting up, what their master plan is from your deep research, what their goal is.
[01:36:16.633 --> 01:36:33.902]  Because studying the world, studying history, you know, doing this radio show, it's been quite a journey for myself in 13 years because all of us that do research, whether they're a neuro, you know, top brain surgeon like yourself or a member of Congress like Ron Paul, we come to the same conclusion separately.
[01:36:34.542 --> 01:36:36.203]  This is the stated goal.
[01:36:36.223 --> 01:36:38.865]  And I see just a microcosm example.
[01:36:39.605 --> 01:37:02.998]  A few years ago, it's in my film, Endgame, the legislature was having hearings about why so many foster children were dying, why they were grabbing hundreds of thousands of children, a million, a million point four nationwide every year, why 67% of children nationwide and in Texas, the state average was the same as the national average here, of 67% put on psychotropic drugs, and the head of the psychiatry department,
[01:37:04.119 --> 01:37:07.282]  Association of Texas got up and said, well, they have bad gene pools.
[01:37:07.723 --> 01:37:09.265]  So that's why we're doing this to these children.
[01:37:09.965 --> 01:37:11.527]  And you run into any of these guys.
[01:37:12.468 --> 01:37:14.710]  I've been to a lot of events and they'll go, yeah, we're getting rid of people.
[01:37:15.671 --> 01:37:16.893]  Humans are a disease.
[01:37:16.913 --> 01:37:17.734]  We're a parasite.
[01:37:18.054 --> 01:37:19.235]  And we the elite are getting rid of them.
[01:37:19.656 --> 01:37:25.201]  And I tell the story, my mother one time was riding with my father and myself when they were visiting me.
[01:37:26.337 --> 01:37:29.600]  And they'd come into the office and seen part of Endgame a year and a half ago being finished.
[01:37:30.101 --> 01:37:36.527]  And my mother said, son, I know you tell the truth about all this stuff, and she's got a degree in history, but she said, I can't believe they really want to kill 80% of us.
[01:37:36.587 --> 01:37:46.376]  And my dad had never told the story, and he goes, he was a top student in high school and then went on, this is when he was still in high school, was taken to UT as part of this Academy of Sciences.
[01:37:47.077 --> 01:38:01.341]  And they tested thousands of kids, and he was down to the top six, and they took him aside and said, we want to send you to one of these top schools, we want you to be part of the New World Order, we're going to carry out eugenics, the public, we've got to get rid of the majority of the population.
[01:38:01.781 --> 01:38:06.383]  And my dad got out of it at that point, because he was well read in history, he said, this is really sick!
[01:38:06.783 --> 01:38:10.105]  Right, and if you go into the New World Order, she even makes this statement.
[01:38:10.145 --> 01:38:16.689]  She said, in December 1946, the Special Committee launched its new policy, accommodating its work for a New World Order, efforts toward internationalism.
[01:38:35.069 --> 01:38:38.352]  In other words, they were internationalizing this eugenics program.
[01:38:38.432 --> 01:39:02.090]  As you said, in 1945, because of the Holocaust and the bad publicity that was spreading over the world of social planning and eugenics, they immediately told all of their people to get all of the references in our writings to social control, social planning, and eugenics out of it.
[01:39:02.697 --> 01:39:05.238]  We'll just change the names that people won't recognize.
[01:39:05.258 --> 01:39:12.541]  Now, she says this in her book, and she's a major MIT Johns Hopkins trained historian.
[01:39:12.781 --> 01:39:16.383]  This is crypto eugenics.
[01:39:16.483 --> 01:39:18.023]  They overnight changed all the names.
[01:39:18.443 --> 01:39:18.864]  Right.
[01:39:18.904 --> 01:39:26.707]  They collectively went out and removed all of these names, so then their publications sounded very high.
[01:39:26.867 --> 01:39:30.628]  Getting rid of the infirm became the bioethicist movement.
[01:39:31.008 --> 01:39:31.449]  Right.
[01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:33.361]  Exactly.
[01:39:33.381 --> 01:39:47.970]  And of course, one of the most powerful of all the associations is the Social Sciences Research Council, which Rockefeller formed back in, I think, 1904, 1907, something like that.
[01:39:48.690 --> 01:39:53.553]  And now it is an enormously powerful organization that has a number.
[01:39:53.653 --> 01:40:00.577]  It has something like, I think, in 1950, it had 16 different foundations supporting it, all of them Rockefeller-connected.
[01:40:01.603 --> 01:40:11.528]  So they were pouring massive money into it, and it virtually controlled the entire social sciences research, not just in this country, but all over the world.
[01:40:11.808 --> 01:40:17.430]  And there meanwhile were scouting for all the new brains to make sure that the brain trust was under their control.
[01:40:18.351 --> 01:40:18.831]  Exactly.
[01:40:19.111 --> 01:40:27.595]  And by controlling education and controlling the media, they made sure that people all conformed to this way of thinking.
[01:40:27.635 --> 01:40:30.196]  Now, here's the way they controlled the people who were
[01:40:30.989 --> 01:40:36.772]  Dissidents in the intellectual world, people that were professors in the universities didn't want to go along with it.
[01:40:36.792 --> 01:40:37.833]  They cut their funding off.
[01:40:38.173 --> 01:40:41.915]  Well, they would cut their funding off, make sure they never got a research grant.
[01:40:42.055 --> 01:40:44.637]  If they were not tenured, they made sure they were fired.
[01:40:46.097 --> 01:40:54.462]  And what they also did to elevate their people to the highest rung of being experts in the world,
[01:40:55.114 --> 01:40:59.715]  If they would give them huge grants so they no longer had to bother with teaching students.
[01:40:59.795 --> 01:41:01.136]  And they would publish their books.
[01:41:01.316 --> 01:41:04.497]  And they would publish their books and make them rock stars in the media.
[01:41:04.697 --> 01:41:10.659]  And they reviewed their books in the journals that they controlled because one of the things they did was they controlled all the journals.
[01:41:11.359 --> 01:41:15.920]  And so then their people's books were reviewed with high praise.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:22.602]  Any person who was a non-conformist, their book was either not reviewed or given poor reviews.
[01:41:23.163 --> 01:41:30.745]  And so when experts were asked for a certain subject for the federal government, they went to the foundation's expert.
[01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:36.427]  They go to the CFR, they go to the SSRC for an expert.
[01:41:36.587 --> 01:41:44.129]  And so, oh yes, we have experts in that area, we have experts in population control, we have experts in any subject that you want.
[01:41:44.169 --> 01:41:46.770]  And of course, it's all their people with all their philosophy.
[01:41:47.370 --> 01:41:50.171]  And as you say, a lot of this population control is buried in
[01:41:51.681 --> 01:41:54.883]  And language for the general public not to recognize.
[01:41:54.963 --> 01:41:59.826]  And now we're living in really a hundred years of this 70 plus intensely.
[01:41:59.846 --> 01:42:07.531]  Can you continue with closing that gap from the 60s on into today and what the master plan is Dr. Blaylock from your deep research?
[01:42:08.491 --> 01:42:17.517]  Well the plan is they want to get rid of most of the population because what they realize is with technological advances we're not going to need all these workers.
[01:42:17.757 --> 01:42:19.058]  I mean if you look at some of the modern
[01:42:19.568 --> 01:42:20.028]  I think so.
[01:42:30.785 --> 01:42:35.147]  Because everything else is robotic and electronic and technologically controlled.
[01:42:35.567 --> 01:42:36.908]  And that's like Bill Joy.
[01:42:37.328 --> 01:42:51.314]  That's like Bill Joy, whenever he went back in 99 to a big technology conference and he's worth 4 billion bucks, co-owner of Sun Microsystems, and he came back and wrote an article, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, in Wired Magazine, and he said, look, I met with the elite, they're planning to kill everybody.
[01:42:51.934 --> 01:42:56.356]  Well, they don't need them, and the other thing that you read... That's what he said, he said they don't need them because of the robotics.
[01:42:56.823 --> 01:43:00.626]  Well, the thing you also realize when you read in the literature is they're scared of them.
[01:43:00.946 --> 01:43:13.674]  Because now you have a large segment of your population that's unemployed, they become restless, and then they're a danger to the established order, to the elite.
[01:43:14.235 --> 01:43:26.283]  And so the thing that they're trying to do is reduce the population size through various measures like birth control, abortion, you know, all of these different methods, the soft methods,
[01:43:26.775 --> 01:43:34.080]  To get rid of people, and of course they're using over-vaccination, fluoride, mercury, all of these other things that increase mortality.
[01:43:34.981 --> 01:43:46.710]  They're keeping treatments out of the medical world that could save a lot of lives, improve health, because they want people to die off that are not in the elite group.
[01:43:46.770 --> 01:43:50.152]  Now, if you look back at the French Revolution, a lot of people don't know this.
[01:43:50.853 --> 01:43:55.256]  In the French Revolution, one of the ideas was to kill most of the population of France.
[01:43:56.109 --> 01:44:08.793]  And the idea was that we would have a group of elite and since we've killed 10 million people in France, the rest of us would have all this land to ourselves, a very small population and we'd have all the food we need.
[01:44:10.844 --> 01:44:24.077]  Yeah, they want to go back to nature and back to neo-feudalism, back to feudalism, hence neo-feudalism, and just to back you up, this all goes back to Malthus in the 1750s.
[01:44:28.021 --> 01:44:32.544]  Exactly, and they wrote about it openly back then.
[01:44:32.564 --> 01:44:35.306]  You know, now it's more disguised, they changed the language that most people wouldn't
[01:44:56.064 --> 01:44:58.005]  Really recognize what they were talking about.
[01:44:58.045 --> 01:45:12.812]  If you get some of these pamphlets and material from the Social Science Research Council, if you don't know the code word, if you don't know what they're talking about, like sustainability, if you don't understand what that means, it sounds very benign.
[01:45:12.832 --> 01:45:16.534]  It sounds very philanthropic, a good thing to do.
[01:45:17.254 --> 01:45:22.357]  But if you understand the code word, what they're planning, you realize it's absolute control.
[01:45:23.141 --> 01:45:26.603]  Uh, it is, uh, planning means an elite controls your life.
[01:45:27.824 --> 01:45:46.837]  And to put it on a scale that people can understand, all this, this new, uh, move toward, uh, uh, eminent domain where they come in and take a man's business and say, well, for the public good, if we tear down his business and build a high-rise there or shopping center, we'll have a bigger tax base.
[01:45:47.377 --> 01:45:49.779]  And so they use eminent domain to take his property.
[01:45:49.819 --> 01:45:51.180]  Well, that's central planning.
[01:45:52.077 --> 01:45:54.900]  That's social planning.
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:58.343]  And their total rationale is social Darwinism.
[01:45:58.723 --> 01:46:03.708]  They believe that it's not horrible to kill people or enslave them or inject them with cancer viruses and the vaccines.
[01:46:04.268 --> 01:46:11.114]  It is good because they have the right of kings to do whatever they want because they're in the elite position.
[01:46:11.554 --> 01:46:15.298]  That is prima facie evidence of their genetic superiority.
[01:46:16.375 --> 01:46:23.161]  That's exactly right, and this is exactly what Dr. Kay says in her history book of molecular biology, that that was always their thought.
[01:46:23.822 --> 01:46:39.835]  That we're the elite, we're the best gene, and therefore we should do human engineering, the new science of man, so we reduce population to those of us who, number one, have the elite minds, the pure genetics,
[01:46:40.362 --> 01:46:45.450]  And then we'll keep a small core of people to do the menial tasks that we don't want to do.
[01:46:45.490 --> 01:46:51.619]  And they even wrote about, uh, keep these people uneducated because there's no need to educate them.
[01:46:51.739 --> 01:46:53.342]  They're going to be doing menial tasks.
[01:46:54.307 --> 01:46:58.289]  And, uh, you know, it's interesting reading these things because they were so open about it.
[01:46:58.349 --> 01:47:04.331]  And there's quite a few books on social control that are written in the 20s and 30s that openly talk about these things.
[01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:05.452]  Edward Bernays and others.
[01:47:06.412 --> 01:47:07.973]  Stay there, Dr. Blaylock.
[01:47:08.093 --> 01:47:08.673]  Quick break.
[01:47:08.693 --> 01:47:10.594]  We're gonna come right back to you.
[01:47:10.614 --> 01:47:13.995]  Uh, this is just so important and we're so honored to have you here.
[01:47:14.295 --> 01:47:16.176]  Folks, I can't think of a more important subject.
[01:47:16.696 --> 01:47:20.678]  I hope you're telling your friends and family to tune into this live show and the rebroadcast.
[01:47:20.698 --> 01:47:21.118]  This is key.
[01:47:23.084 --> 01:47:34.803]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.
[01:47:35.410 --> 01:47:38.011]  Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[01:47:38.571 --> 01:47:45.293]  Between now and January 20, 2009, all food units U1 through U7 are being offered at wholesale prices.
[01:47:45.793 --> 01:47:47.333]  That's a 33% savings.
[01:47:47.633 --> 01:47:50.934]  A year's supply of meals starts as low as $0.73 per meal.
[01:47:51.354 --> 01:47:54.655]  Ready Reserve food offers only the highest quality dehydrated food.
[01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:58.096]  Packed in double enameled cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere.
[01:48:02.961 --> 01:48:06.084]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[01:48:30.043 --> 01:48:31.064]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:48:31.305 --> 01:48:37.734]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:48:38.354 --> 01:48:46.866]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:48:47.233 --> 01:48:54.039]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:48:54.339 --> 01:48:57.402]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:48:57.502 --> 01:49:02.726]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:49:03.287 --> 01:49:05.909]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:49:06.370 --> 01:49:13.596]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[01:49:16.254 --> 01:49:17.294]  Government-sponsored terror.
[01:49:17.714 --> 01:49:20.315]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:49:21.955 --> 01:49:22.295]  Good day.
[01:49:22.335 --> 01:49:23.836]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:49:23.956 --> 01:49:24.576]  January 5th, 2009.
[01:49:24.616 --> 01:49:25.616]  Gold open this morning at $845.47.
[01:49:25.676 --> 01:49:28.397]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $870.47, $435.23 for a half ounce, and $217.62 for a quarter ounce.
[01:49:28.437 --> 01:49:28.837]  That's $870.47, $435.23, and $217.62.
[01:49:39.508 --> 01:49:51.919]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:49:52.039 --> 01:49:55.121]  With a stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:49:55.222 --> 01:49:58.504]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:49:58.564 --> 01:50:01.387]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[01:50:01.647 --> 01:50:04.388]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:50:04.448 --> 01:50:06.749]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:50:07.349 --> 01:50:09.530]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:50:09.650 --> 01:50:10.350]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:16.232]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:50:16.272 --> 01:50:16.452]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:50:22.395 --> 01:50:27.939]  IonicZone.com has the best prices on commercial shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:35.804]  But did you know IonicZone.com also sells a water ozonator that's a must-have for anyone interested in good health?
[01:50:36.184 --> 01:50:36.625]  It's true.
[01:50:36.905 --> 01:50:45.691]  The IonicZone digital water ozonator features an air intake and can be fed dry air through the supplied air dryer or pure oxygen via an oxygen tank.
[01:50:46.051 --> 01:50:55.537]  Ozone-fortified water can be used to kill bacteria, sanitize food, produce, and eliminates bacteria in the mouth by gargling, which helps prevent bad breath and even heart disease.
[01:50:55.918 --> 01:51:02.522]  The optional ozone bidet attachment is used for personal hygiene, which can kill the bacteria down below that can lead to irritation.
[01:51:02.902 --> 01:51:05.764]  It's amazing what three atoms of oxygen can do!
[01:51:06.145 --> 01:51:07.666]  Call Ionic Zone today at 1-800-549-9535.
[01:51:07.686 --> 01:51:08.106]  That's 1-800-549-9535.
[01:51:15.811 --> 01:51:16.231]  We're good.
[01:51:40.427 --> 01:51:47.755]  Close to 50 or so original source government textbooks and foundation textbooks where they say they're going to exterminate us.
[01:51:48.416 --> 01:51:53.521]  The United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment in 96, in 89.
[01:51:54.202 --> 01:51:55.183]  This is all public.
[01:51:55.884 --> 01:51:56.985]  It's just not widely known.
[01:51:57.065 --> 01:51:57.886]  This is true.
[01:51:58.587 --> 01:52:00.188]  This is real what we're talking about.
[01:52:00.228 --> 01:52:02.431]  They want us dead.
[01:52:03.996 --> 01:52:05.917]  And they are spraying us, the GMO.
[01:52:06.357 --> 01:52:08.419]  You know, there's hundreds of different types of plastics.
[01:52:08.439 --> 01:52:09.399]  They can make it expensively.
[01:52:09.699 --> 01:52:12.021]  They chose the one formula that...
[01:52:13.402 --> 01:52:19.304]  Releases these toxins, these endocrine disruptors that manipulate our hormone levels.
[01:52:19.384 --> 01:52:22.745]  Why did they choose that one type for universal adoption worldwide?
[01:52:23.105 --> 01:52:29.187]  And sell the factory formulas and machines and systems, sometimes at a loss, to make sure that was implemented in the 50s.
[01:52:29.507 --> 01:52:31.827]  Then we see the sperm counts drop, we see the fertility problems.
[01:52:32.148 --> 01:52:38.089]  Why do they approve the bovine growth hormone to put in the milk when they know it's linked to cancer and all these problems?
[01:52:38.409 --> 01:52:39.930]  Why do they put mercury in vaccines?
[01:52:40.370 --> 01:52:43.772]  You know, we've gotten up to the point of their master plan, Dr. Blaylock.
[01:52:44.793 --> 01:52:45.654]  This is a short segment.
[01:52:45.674 --> 01:52:52.918]  I want to come back in the next long segment and take some calls from Jen and Sherry and Robert and Brad and Dr. Tracy and others that are holding.
[01:52:53.819 --> 01:52:55.740]  But any other... I mean, there's so many.
[01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:56.241]  We talked for 10 hours.
[01:52:56.321 --> 01:52:59.743]  I'm going to definitely have you back if you'll grace us with your time to warn people.
[01:52:59.763 --> 01:53:02.625]  I mean, what do we do about this?
[01:53:02.805 --> 01:53:04.306]  I mean, we're here trying to warn folks.
[01:53:04.326 --> 01:53:05.047]  This is real.
[01:53:05.287 --> 01:53:09.670]  This affects everybody, except for a few thousand elitist
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:14.803]  Who even write about how they know they're being hurt by the blowback, but it's okay for the greater work they're doing.
[01:53:15.023 --> 01:53:17.165]  I mean, how do we counter this?
[01:53:19.146 --> 01:53:24.349]  Well, it's very difficult, because like I say, they have the entire wealth of the world at their disposal.
[01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:26.711]  They essentially control all the media.
[01:53:26.751 --> 01:53:35.717]  I mean, back in the 1950s, a guy by the name of Manuel Josephson, who was a medical doctor, he wrote a book on
[01:53:38.829 --> 01:53:42.212]  On Rockefeller, it's quite detailed, very well documented.
[01:53:43.153 --> 01:53:55.064]  And he talks about these things in that book as well, how Rockefeller was absolutely obsessed with controlling all information that's available to the public.
[01:53:55.104 --> 01:54:00.969]  And the way he did it, even back then, he was spending something like $250 million controlling the media.
[01:54:05.035 --> 01:54:21.709]  And by being the major controlling force in literally hundreds if not thousands of corporations, all of which advertised in the major media, by 1950s all the major media was dependent on their advertising dollar.
[01:54:22.290 --> 01:54:27.394]  So anything he wanted in the media and anything he didn't want in the media,
[01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:32.652]  All you had to do is let them know, well you would lose your funding if that's discussed.
[01:54:44.608 --> 01:54:51.174]  There are elitists and wannabe elitists, a lot of these Minion professors, and I use the local Lawson example of Dr. Eric Pianca.
[01:54:52.074 --> 01:55:00.081]  He gives speeches, it's been in the news, where he says we need to kill 90% of the public, and the point is, they get 95% standing ovations.
[01:55:00.401 --> 01:55:07.708]  He powerpoints a huge thing of skulls with a red filter on the wall, this has been on national news, and everybody claps and the scientist
[01:55:08.348 --> 01:55:16.895]  Cry, and he goes and speaks to the Royal Academy in England, and the big Royal Academies, and the most prestigious academies in France.
[01:55:18.937 --> 01:55:25.502]  I know you've written papers and spoken to some of those big groups as well, but the point is, and the majority of them start crying.
[01:55:25.522 --> 01:55:28.225]  This has been in the newspaper, because this is their religion.
[01:55:28.585 --> 01:55:30.627]  What do you want to say to those people listening?
[01:55:31.187 --> 01:55:33.929]  I mean, what would be your counter and your argument to them?
[01:55:33.969 --> 01:55:37.511]  I mean, reaching out to them and going, my God, look what you've done!
[01:55:37.571 --> 01:55:40.813]  I mean, trying to get them to come over to our side of humanity.
[01:55:41.874 --> 01:55:44.115]  Well, you know, this is the collectivist idea.
[01:55:44.716 --> 01:55:46.937]  And we're steeped in collectivism.
[01:55:47.318 --> 01:55:57.184]  This was the whole program of virtually every president since the Civil War is the gradual implementation of collectivism in the United States.
[01:55:57.836 --> 01:56:00.717]  And collectivism basically says the individual doesn't matter.
[01:56:00.837 --> 01:56:03.357]  What matters is the community.
[01:56:04.237 --> 01:56:06.958]  Well, community doesn't really mean a lot.
[01:56:07.238 --> 01:56:11.779]  If you listen to communist jargon, they say the people.
[01:56:12.179 --> 01:56:13.340]  We speak for the people.
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:16.620]  Well, this mythological people is nobody.
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:19.561]  It's whoever's in charge, whoever owns the gun.
[01:56:20.698 --> 01:56:25.680]  And so the government owns all the power, and so they speak for the people, they speak for the public.
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:36.864]  So when you hear them saying, this is for the good of the public, or this is good for the bad... And then in reality, the eugenicists, the communists, they always kill the people, because they hate the people.
[01:56:37.505 --> 01:56:38.625]  Well, they fear the people.
[01:56:39.225 --> 01:56:49.109]  You know, historically, if you look at every dictatorship, what eventually happens, is they come to fear the people, because they know that what they're doing is unpopular and not working.
[01:56:49.611 --> 01:56:50.871]  And then they fear revolution.
[01:56:51.431 --> 01:56:51.511]  Yes.
[01:56:51.571 --> 01:56:54.232]  And this is what happens with collectivism in the United States.
[01:56:54.312 --> 01:57:05.914]  As it becomes more and more collective, people recognize the elitist is now what's causing my financial failure, or the leaders are what's causing, you know, whatever bad is happening.
[01:57:05.934 --> 01:57:06.474]  The parasites!
[01:57:06.514 --> 01:57:07.235]  Stay there, doctor.
[01:57:07.555 --> 01:57:07.875]  Stay there.
[01:57:07.915 --> 01:57:08.435]  We gotta break.
[01:57:08.455 --> 01:57:10.835]  We'll be right back after this quick break with Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[01:57:10.855 --> 01:57:11.275]  Stay with us.
[01:57:12.456 --> 01:57:13.356]  We're on the march.
[01:57:13.836 --> 01:57:15.436]  The empire's on the run.
[01:57:16.376 --> 01:57:19.057]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:22.719 --> 01:57:26.104]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:57:26.244 --> 01:57:31.451]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:57:31.631 --> 01:57:36.337]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:57:37.639 --> 01:57:47.943]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:57:48.303 --> 01:57:53.846]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:57:54.086 --> 01:58:00.148]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:58:00.348 --> 01:58:01.008]  What about you?
[01:58:01.389 --> 01:58:05.990]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:58:22.201 --> 01:58:28.525]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:28.906 --> 01:58:30.587]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:31.519 --> 01:58:32.540]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:33.560]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:33.861 --> 01:58:34.841]  This is his M.O.
[01:58:34.861 --> 01:58:36.182]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:58:36.222 --> 01:58:37.903]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:58:38.243 --> 01:58:44.988]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:58:45.388 --> 01:58:45.828]  Some U.S.
[01:58:45.868 --> 01:58:51.512]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:58:52.212 --> 01:58:55.715]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:58:55.735 --> 01:58:58.518]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:22.355 --> 01:59:23.236]  Detoxify.
[01:59:23.296 --> 01:59:27.778]  You are constantly reminded how important detoxify is to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[01:59:27.898 --> 01:59:33.682]  You are also being reminded that it's important to detoxify safely and not all products will provide safe and effective results.
[01:59:33.882 --> 01:59:37.664]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body with safe and effective Keelermax.
[01:59:37.804 --> 01:59:42.747]  With the help of Nutriodime, Keelermax will help your body to remove heavy metals, toxins, and chemicals.
[01:59:42.927 --> 01:59:48.469]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins and fluoride, bromine and chloride.
[01:59:48.609 --> 01:59:52.550]  Add Malignabla to stimulate these two detox and anti-cancer protection.
[01:59:52.630 --> 01:59:57.191]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membranes.
[01:59:57.411 --> 02:00:03.933]  And Nutratrala to recycle all fat and water-soluble antioxidant cellular protection enzymes and molecules.
[02:00:04.073 --> 02:00:06.314]  Keeler Maxx and Dr. Bill's Oral Detox.
[02:00:06.554 --> 02:00:11.517]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually
[02:00:35.177 --> 02:00:36.197]  Too many kids
[02:01:04.813 --> 02:01:06.177]  Are what's making the planet worse?
[02:01:06.438 --> 02:01:08.665]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[02:01:08.765 --> 02:01:11.252]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:01:13.419 --> 02:01:19.383]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[02:01:19.763 --> 02:01:26.547]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:01:26.647 --> 02:01:31.650]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[02:01:31.670 --> 02:01:34.532]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[02:01:34.592 --> 02:01:38.774]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[02:01:38.874 --> 02:01:41.836]  We have to work the dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[02:01:43.169 --> 02:01:47.053]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[02:01:47.233 --> 02:01:47.954]  Well, join me.
[02:01:48.474 --> 02:01:50.597]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[02:01:50.877 --> 02:01:52.699]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:02:00.607]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:02:12.583 --> 02:02:13.844]  You have been warned!
[02:02:14.705 --> 02:02:17.628]  All of you out there listening, I'm giving you the documents.
[02:02:17.788 --> 02:02:18.929]  I made the film Endgame.
[02:02:19.069 --> 02:02:21.951]  Dr. Blaylock's made films, written books, all sourced.
[02:02:22.632 --> 02:02:27.516]  Psychopathic, control freak killers are in control of our society.
[02:02:27.536 --> 02:02:28.857]  They're setting up world government.
[02:02:29.198 --> 02:02:38.186]  They're engineering the financial collapse in their own words to bring in total control, where every facet of your life will be controlled, where you'll pay carbon taxes for everything you do.
[02:02:39.329 --> 02:02:40.830]  Where bureaucrats will run your life.
[02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:42.070]  Youth brigades.
[02:02:42.751 --> 02:02:47.233]  The list goes on and on and on and on.
[02:02:47.253 --> 02:02:50.775]  You just heard Walter Cronkite talking about the right hand of Satan.
[02:02:50.815 --> 02:02:52.816]  You just heard Henry Kissinger calling for world government.
[02:02:53.216 --> 02:02:55.277]  You heard Fox News saying children are bad.
[02:02:55.297 --> 02:02:57.939]  This is the program.
[02:02:58.916 --> 02:03:06.619]  I want to tell the police and military that serve the New World Order, most of you don't understand this, you better learn it, you are being poisoned and killed as well.
[02:03:06.719 --> 02:03:17.103]  Dr. Blaylock, I want to go to calls, but let's say you had three minutes on national TV to address the public about the program, the toxins, the poisons, what's in their food and water, and how to avoid it.
[02:03:17.483 --> 02:03:23.325]  If you had three minutes to boil it down and warn people, because this will be seen, it's being heard by millions,
[02:03:23.865 --> 02:03:28.807]  Well, what they need to know is that the authorities, the people who are defending these things like vaccination, the thimerosal, the fluoride in the water,
[02:03:50.649 --> 02:03:55.093]  They never have a defense against the charges that are being made.
[02:03:55.133 --> 02:03:57.495]  They never even attempt to answer these questions.
[02:03:58.876 --> 02:04:05.342]  When I challenge these people on vaccination, they won't even appear on the radio to challenge me.
[02:04:05.362 --> 02:04:06.403]  I did that in Hawaii.
[02:04:06.443 --> 02:04:11.247]  We challenged the public health to come on and debate what I had to say.
[02:04:11.287 --> 02:04:12.268]  They wouldn't even appear.
[02:04:12.868 --> 02:04:18.393]  Because I know something that the other people talking about vaccines are not talking about, and that is when you vaccinate
[02:04:19.008 --> 02:04:34.901]  With these large numbers of vaccine, it activates the brain's special immune system and will destroy the connections in the brain, alter the development of the brain, and this is why we're seeing so many of these brain disorders and learning difficulties in our children.
[02:04:35.561 --> 02:04:43.908]  Now, these things are backed up by enormous research, thousands of studies all over the world by independent researchers.
[02:04:44.582 --> 02:04:49.605]  It's not that the research is not there and the proof is not there, it's that the media won't carry it.
[02:04:50.906 --> 02:04:53.807]  None of the major publications will carry this story.
[02:04:54.308 --> 02:04:55.428]  They won't interview you.
[02:04:55.648 --> 02:04:58.070]  They don't want to have this exposed.
[02:04:58.590 --> 02:05:05.014]  So we're having to use the other outlets, like the Alex Jones Show, to get this to the public.
[02:05:05.774 --> 02:05:08.195]  It's very well documented.
[02:05:08.255 --> 02:05:10.537]  If you look at my website, you'll see a lot of references.
[02:05:10.577 --> 02:05:12.858]  If you read my books, everything is referenced.
[02:05:13.884 --> 02:05:20.607]  Uh, in the scientific literature, it's all peer-reviewed journals, uh, from some of the biggest laboratories in the world.
[02:05:20.627 --> 02:05:23.629]  Uh, but they don't want you to know these things.
[02:05:24.529 --> 02:05:32.133]  Uh, and so, uh, you know, people need to wake up and realize you're being fed a lot of propaganda.
[02:05:32.153 --> 02:05:35.254]  You're being controlled by propaganda.
[02:05:35.634 --> 02:05:37.435]  And this is absolutely proven.
[02:05:37.475 --> 02:05:41.237]  The Reese Committee, 1950 Federal Government Investigation
[02:05:41.909 --> 02:05:42.750]  Uh, the foundations.
[02:05:42.990 --> 02:05:44.791]  Prove this beyond a shadow of doubt.
[02:05:44.811 --> 02:05:53.795]  Uh, you can get that book, uh, The Foundations of Power and Influence by, uh, Wormser, who was the general counsel for the Reece Committee.
[02:05:54.436 --> 02:05:55.757]  It's all proven in there.
[02:05:55.937 --> 02:06:04.641]  The control that I'm talking about, uh, the book that I've talked about by Dr. K on molecular biology history, it's all documented in there.
[02:06:04.661 --> 02:06:06.983]  Uh, so the documents are there.
[02:06:07.023 --> 02:06:11.345]  People need to quit watching, uh, football games all the time and, and
[02:06:11.872 --> 02:06:20.599]  And garbage on the television, and realize this is a very serious abridgment of our freedom.
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:24.702]  We're seeing the rise of a world totalitarian government.
[02:06:25.523 --> 02:06:30.347]  And if we don't wake up and start doing something now, it's going to be irreversible.
[02:06:30.407 --> 02:06:34.670]  Because like I say, they have the wealth of the world on their side.
[02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:35.711]  They have the media.
[02:06:36.432 --> 02:06:37.413]  They have Hollywood.
[02:06:37.493 --> 02:06:38.814]  They have publishing firms.
[02:06:39.634 --> 02:06:41.476]  They've taken over a hundred years
[02:06:42.250 --> 02:06:45.093]  To institute this, very carefully.
[02:07:01.352 --> 02:07:12.281]  Before we go to these calls, I just want to point out to the military, the police, the bureaucrats, those that enforce this, so many of them I talk to or that email me, they laugh and they say, so what if it's all true?
[02:07:12.321 --> 02:07:13.162]  I'm part of the elite.
[02:07:14.023 --> 02:07:22.970]  They're all under the same attack and there's no reason that 99% of the public wouldn't have a stake in fighting back against this.
[02:07:23.050 --> 02:07:28.614]  I mean, you know, the final problem is people just have trouble dealing with the magnitude.
[02:07:29.935 --> 02:07:33.457]  This is the nature of our world today, and this is what we're facing.
[02:07:34.277 --> 02:07:35.258]  How do you see it?
[02:07:35.598 --> 02:07:39.580]  Well, you know, if they think they're the elite, they need to read the history of the Soviet Union.
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:45.543]  All the people who were responsible for bringing the Soviet Union to power were killed.
[02:07:46.263 --> 02:07:46.663]  All of them.
[02:07:47.204 --> 02:07:54.267]  The entire, virtually the entire NKVD in the beginning was wiped out.
[02:07:54.327 --> 02:07:55.108]  That's your police.
[02:07:55.288 --> 02:07:57.349]  That's the people who were doing the killing initially.
[02:07:57.369 --> 02:07:58.569]  They thought they were protected.
[02:07:58.810 --> 02:07:59.570]  They were all killed.
[02:07:59.966 --> 02:08:01.827]  The head of the NKVD was murdered.
[02:08:02.427 --> 02:08:06.849]  So, you know, if they think they're protected, they're fooling themselves.
[02:08:07.029 --> 02:08:07.970]  Same thing with the Nazis.
[02:08:08.010 --> 02:08:09.571]  And then they get rid of them.
[02:08:09.591 --> 02:08:11.371]  Same thing with the Nazis, not the Long Knives.
[02:08:11.612 --> 02:08:13.352]  Right, because they cannot be trusted.
[02:08:13.452 --> 02:08:27.099]  If you read Soviet literature, the first thing they tell you is the revolutionaries that bring this about can't be trusted, because when they see they lied to, then they want to revolt, so they have to kill them off or put them in gulags.
[02:08:27.139 --> 02:08:29.240]  Well, what did Caesar do after he got Fowler?
[02:08:31.289 --> 02:08:41.254]  It's throughout all of world history, from the very beginning, as I said when we were talking about the proletarian government, the first thing that happens is they fear the people.
[02:08:41.914 --> 02:08:43.895]  They fear their own special police.
[02:08:44.856 --> 02:08:47.977]  So they periodically have a purge.
[02:08:48.257 --> 02:08:59.003]  Well, if you study special forces, after they've used special forces for dirty deeds all over the world, they always shut them up or put a conviction on them to discredit them so they can't ever speak out, or they kill them.
[02:09:00.461 --> 02:09:01.442]  I mean, this is so horrible.
[02:09:01.462 --> 02:09:02.183]  Well, God bless you.
[02:09:02.203 --> 02:09:17.317]  I want to take some calls here in the final 20 minutes we have left, Dr. Blaylock, but for those that aren't watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, verbally give folks, again, your website so they can check it out and hopefully you've got some ways for people to try to protect themselves.
[02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:20.550]  I mean, we know they're now spraying us, and we know.
[02:09:20.570 --> 02:09:31.615]  I've got mainstream news about DARPA and mainstream papers saying they're going to put up towers with ultrasound to soothe the public during crises.
[02:09:32.155 --> 02:09:33.375]  Have you seen this research?
[02:09:33.996 --> 02:09:34.756]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:09:35.236 --> 02:09:38.398]  You see, they've had this decade of the brain.
[02:09:39.658 --> 02:09:44.300]  They are pouring literally billions of dollars into neuroscience research.
[02:09:45.129 --> 02:09:48.791]  A lot of it is design and how to control people's thinking.
[02:09:49.292 --> 02:10:05.581]  And if you read Delgado's book, who is a very highly regarded neurophysiologist, who did depth electrode studies on the brain and how to control behavior, and in his book he said the last refuge of the individual is his own mind, and thereafter that.
[02:10:06.342 --> 02:10:10.344]  They want that last refuge to, your thoughts will no longer be your thoughts.
[02:10:10.922 --> 02:10:15.064]  And they're using this massive investment in neuroscience to figure out how to do that.
[02:10:16.085 --> 02:10:29.311]  And a lot of these techniques are what they're doing, things to make people apathetic, things to make people... You know, I have a friend of mine who worked for the NSA as a debriefer of Soviet defectors.
[02:10:29.931 --> 02:10:37.395]  And he told me about all the different drugs they had discovered that could make you change your entire attitude, where anti-communists would become communists.
[02:10:38.092 --> 02:10:38.432]  I think so.
[02:10:56.791 --> 02:10:58.892]  By methods like you were just discussing.
[02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:33.455]  When it says they can control the public, and then I have CBS newscasts where they say they're going to start doing this to prisoners to reform them.
[02:11:33.495 --> 02:11:35.696]  I mean, this is open mind control.
[02:11:35.736 --> 02:11:39.579]  The towers are now up, and you tell people this and they roll their eyes at you.
[02:11:40.259 --> 02:11:42.080]  Well, it's absolutely true.
[02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:52.207]  I can tell you, I've spent a lot of time reading neuroscience literature, and these techniques are being developed, and the government is very, very interested in these.
[02:11:53.007 --> 02:11:55.369]  And it's being funded by these major foundations.
[02:11:56.019 --> 02:11:56.599]  Unbelievable.
[02:11:56.619 --> 02:12:00.201]  This has always been a dream of theirs, to control human thinking.
[02:12:00.421 --> 02:12:03.763]  Well, the Pentagon says 90% of war is mind war now.
[02:12:04.263 --> 02:12:05.184]  Right.
[02:12:05.804 --> 02:12:08.185]  And folks, I mean, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:12:08.225 --> 02:12:08.846]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[02:12:08.866 --> 02:12:09.606]  Let's take some calls.
[02:12:09.986 --> 02:12:12.107]  Jen, in Georgia, you're on the air.
[02:12:12.167 --> 02:12:12.467]  Welcome.
[02:12:14.308 --> 02:12:14.648]  Hello?
[02:12:15.069 --> 02:12:16.449]  Hi, you're on the air with Dr. Blalock.
[02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:17.710]  Hi.
[02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:20.091]  Oh my goodness, I'm getting really excited.
[02:12:20.131 --> 02:12:21.912]  Finally, he took my call.
[02:12:21.972 --> 02:12:24.373]  I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
[02:12:26.443 --> 02:12:31.284]  I'm sorry to be a little off topic, because I don't have any questions for the doctor right now.
[02:12:31.304 --> 02:12:33.665]  Okay, be real quick then, I'm going to move on to some other folks.
[02:12:33.685 --> 02:12:34.285]  I'll be real quick.
[02:12:34.985 --> 02:12:38.086]  I have a question about the previous guest that was on your show.
[02:12:39.387 --> 02:12:43.848]  He was the author who wrote the book about Obama being a post-modern coup.
[02:12:45.348 --> 02:12:46.329]  That's Webster Tarpley.
[02:12:46.829 --> 02:12:48.649]  Yeah, Webster, yeah, him.
[02:12:49.250 --> 02:12:54.391]  Well, he said that, well, on a previous show, I don't know exactly the date,
[02:12:54.878 --> 02:13:07.417]  He was on the show and he said that over 40% of the people who voted against Obama voted against fascism, when in fact, I don't think that he's referring to the people who voted for John McCain.
[02:13:07.850 --> 02:13:08.110]  Ma'am.
[02:13:08.651 --> 02:13:08.831]  Ma'am.
[02:13:08.851 --> 02:13:09.432]  That is not true.
[02:13:09.572 --> 02:13:10.774]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:13:11.055 --> 02:13:14.860]  I'm trying to make calls pretty much for the doctor.
[02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:16.162]  Let me try to explain something.
[02:13:16.562 --> 02:13:18.385]  There's a psychological dictatorship.
[02:13:18.445 --> 02:13:24.393]  We're living in a highly controlled, scientifically designed, the elite openly call it the final revolution.
[02:13:25.134 --> 02:13:40.640]  Okay, where in the words of Bertrand Russell, who said they would inject us with mercury to brain damage us at birth, he said, a rebellion by the proletariat, the general public, would be as impossible as a rebellion of sheep against the practice of eating mutton or lamb chops.
[02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:45.542]  They see us, we're almost at that point where it isn't about Obama.
[02:13:46.082 --> 02:13:46.682]  He's a puppet.
[02:13:46.903 --> 02:13:47.803]  McCain's a puppet.
[02:13:48.883 --> 02:13:51.105]  We're pointing out that Obama is the heir apparent.
[02:13:51.325 --> 02:13:57.710]  Pat Robertson's now endorsing him to fool the people to going along with the next phase of collectivism.
[02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:58.370]  Dr. Blaylock?
[02:13:58.390 --> 02:14:00.592]  I absolutely agree.
[02:14:01.893 --> 02:14:02.673]  I absolutely agree.
[02:14:02.693 --> 02:14:05.075]  You know, everybody looks at the President.
[02:14:05.115 --> 02:14:06.516]  The President is an empty suit.
[02:14:07.477 --> 02:14:10.379]  He's being manipulated by the Foundation.
[02:14:10.439 --> 02:14:11.619]  They decide policy.
[02:14:13.281 --> 02:14:14.241]  The President doesn't.
[02:14:14.321 --> 02:14:15.222]  The Congress doesn't.
[02:14:15.714 --> 02:14:20.399]  Nobody in the government really makes any decisions, and if you look at Congress now, they're paralyzed.
[02:14:20.439 --> 02:14:30.128]  I talked to Bob Barr privately a couple years ago, and I asked him, I said, when they stole all these FBI files, is that what's keeping Congress under control?
[02:14:30.148 --> 02:14:31.370]  He said, absolutely.
[02:14:31.710 --> 02:14:33.111]  He said, they have dirt on everybody.
[02:14:33.151 --> 02:14:37.576]  They know what everybody's done, and they're all terrified to resist in any way.
[02:14:37.881 --> 02:14:39.461]  And that's what the surveillance state's about.
[02:14:40.122 --> 02:14:42.882]  Okay, ma'am, look, it's way past that.
[02:14:43.182 --> 02:14:43.482]  Okay?
[02:14:44.443 --> 02:14:45.223]  It's way past that.
[02:14:45.523 --> 02:14:46.943]  Was that Jen or Sherry I just went to?
[02:14:46.963 --> 02:14:49.064]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:14:49.104 --> 02:14:51.164]  I was calling Jen, Sherry.
[02:14:51.224 --> 02:14:52.305]  Now we go to Sherry.
[02:14:52.325 --> 02:14:53.205]  I apologize, Sherry.
[02:14:53.585 --> 02:14:54.125]  You're on the air.
[02:14:54.145 --> 02:14:54.545]  Go ahead.
[02:14:55.345 --> 02:14:56.066]  Hi, Alex.
[02:14:56.086 --> 02:14:56.746]  Hi, Dr. Blaylock.
[02:14:57.066 --> 02:14:58.626]  I have a question for you, doctor.
[02:14:59.166 --> 02:15:03.988]  Is there any legitimate medical reason why 67% of children in
[02:15:06.055 --> 02:15:07.977]  You know, foster care would be on those drugs.
[02:15:09.018 --> 02:15:11.179]  Would there be any reason besides total control?
[02:15:11.399 --> 02:15:14.802]  The federal government says it's for eugenics, but I'm sorry, go ahead, Dr. Boylock.
[02:15:15.683 --> 02:15:18.285]  Now, on drugs, for what?
[02:15:18.786 --> 02:15:22.589]  67% of national average of foster children are on SSRIs.
[02:15:23.630 --> 02:15:29.274]  Oh, yeah, and you know, if you look in the physician's desk reference, it says that children shouldn't be on SSRIs.
[02:15:29.314 --> 02:15:33.338]  That they induce psychosis.
[02:15:34.196 --> 02:15:34.536]  I don't know.
[02:15:42.489 --> 02:15:50.314]  The SSRI is a very bad medication, and if the FDA was real, if it was really a regulatory agency, it would have been removed long ago.
[02:15:50.595 --> 02:16:06.805]  And Doctor, as you know, in the trials of the first big one by Eli Lilly in the early 1980s of the SSRI Prozac, they admitted internally that it caused massive increases in psychopathic breaks, homicide, suicide, but they went ahead and approved it.
[02:16:06.825 --> 02:16:08.486]  The girl hung herself, if I remember correctly, right?
[02:16:08.926 --> 02:16:09.106]  Yes.
[02:16:10.717 --> 02:16:23.713]  Well, you see, this is what I talk about in the film Nutrition and Behavior, is that most of the things we see in children that have to do with abnormal behavior are due to a poor diet and toxin exposure.
[02:16:24.434 --> 02:16:29.300]  And that if you change that, most of these children undergo a radical improvement in their behavior.
[02:16:30.872 --> 02:16:32.593]  And by the way, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[02:16:32.653 --> 02:16:44.684]  Even mainline studies that you see in the press occasionally admit that getting them off dyes, getting them off processed sugars, getting them exercised has massive, you know, better numbers than Prozac, which they even show as detrimental.
[02:16:44.704 --> 02:16:45.005]  Go ahead.
[02:16:45.525 --> 02:16:48.308]  Well, all this is in the mainline peer-reviewed journals.
[02:16:49.258 --> 02:16:52.841]  Did you see the latest number from 2008 that 100 million prescriptions for SSRIs in 2008 in the U.S.? ?
[02:17:09.969 --> 02:17:17.494]  Oh absolutely, and when Bush had the program where he was going to have all the children examined psychologically and have them placed on medication if they needed it.
[02:17:17.834 --> 02:17:18.995]  This is absurd.
[02:17:19.455 --> 02:17:26.099]  That's not the function of the federal government, to have people psychologically evaluated and placed on medication.
[02:17:26.519 --> 02:17:29.501]  This is nothing as dangerous as SSRI medication.
[02:17:30.509 --> 02:17:41.532]  But that's what the eugenicist Aldous Huxley, whose brother later ran the UN, Julian Huxley, who became the head of the eugenicist side and the head of the transhumanist, he said they would drug the public.
[02:17:41.552 --> 02:17:48.054]  That's where THX 1138 and Brave New World come from, because that was the plan, and now they've got 100 million people on them.
[02:17:48.634 --> 02:17:57.357]  Sure, I mean, in the book Brave New World, it talked about the drug FOMA, and that you would calm people down and then you'd have another drug to excite them when you wanted them excited.
[02:17:58.354 --> 02:18:01.515]  Uh, when you want them aesthetic, you put them back on the Soma again.
[02:18:02.055 --> 02:18:05.756]  And now they even have an SSRI on the market, Doctor, called Soma!
[02:18:06.276 --> 02:18:06.677]  Excellent.
[02:18:07.037 --> 02:18:10.838]  You know, it's books right near world revisited.
[02:18:11.218 --> 02:18:15.199]  It goes into the non-fiction description of all of these things.
[02:18:15.499 --> 02:18:16.159]  Hold on, Doctor.
[02:18:16.179 --> 02:18:18.520]  We're going to skip this break for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:20.861]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen, at FullWars.com.
[02:18:22.418 --> 02:18:23.899]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo?
[02:18:23.919 --> 02:18:25.360]  Yeah, I'm going to skip this break, Network.
[02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:26.440]  Okay, thank you.
[02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:29.842]  Anything else you wanted to add, Sherry in Texas, to Dr. Blalock?
[02:18:30.662 --> 02:18:31.523]  No, that was it.
[02:18:31.583 --> 02:18:34.204]  That pretty much answered my question for me.
[02:18:34.304 --> 02:18:34.505]  Thanks.
[02:18:34.585 --> 02:18:35.445]  Okay, thank you.
[02:18:35.925 --> 02:18:37.306]  Robert in California.
[02:18:37.386 --> 02:18:38.467]  Robert, you're on the air.
[02:18:38.507 --> 02:18:38.967]  Go ahead.
[02:18:38.987 --> 02:18:40.488]  Yeah, hello?
[02:18:40.948 --> 02:18:41.208]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:42.089 --> 02:18:44.950]  Hi, Dr. Blalock.
[02:18:45.390 --> 02:18:47.331]  I have a question regarding vaccines.
[02:18:48.392 --> 02:18:51.013]  What would you recommend to people who have already taken vaccines?
[02:18:52.273 --> 02:18:57.255]  Like natural chelation, natural therapy, something along those lines.
[02:18:59.575 --> 02:19:05.517]  Well, you know, if you've taken vaccines that have mercury, I would recommend being tested for mercury.
[02:19:06.137 --> 02:19:06.437]  Right.
[02:19:06.497 --> 02:19:15.820]  How about people who can't really afford seeing a doctor or... Well, the hair testing for most people would be sufficient.
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:18.021]  Isn't it very inexpensive, comparatively?
[02:19:18.081 --> 02:19:19.241]  It's very inexpensive.
[02:19:19.681 --> 02:19:21.922]  And you don't need a doctor's permission to do it.
[02:19:23.208 --> 02:19:25.870]  So you can get your hair tested for mercury level.
[02:19:26.190 --> 02:19:29.392]  So if he does have higher mercury, what does he do?
[02:19:29.952 --> 02:19:40.498]  Well, you know, a lot of things neutralize mercury toxicity in the brain because it's very difficult and some people think it's impossible to remove mercury from the brain once it's in the ionic form.
[02:19:41.518 --> 02:19:44.880]  Selenium neutralizes mercury toxicity.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.801]  Quercetin helps neutralize it.
[02:19:46.841 --> 02:19:51.284]  Many of the flavonoids, like curcumin, all these things are available now.
[02:19:52.409 --> 02:19:52.670]  Right.
[02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:54.571]  How about hormones?
[02:19:54.611 --> 02:19:56.312]  I know you take several hormones.
[02:19:56.572 --> 02:20:00.054]  How about those with like low thyroids?
[02:20:00.214 --> 02:20:01.114]  What would you recommend?
[02:20:02.735 --> 02:20:08.499]  Well, you know, if you have low thyroid, of course, you need supplementation to bring it back up to normal.
[02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:17.904]  But, you know, removing at DMSA, you can use it as a very slow removal over a long period of time.
[02:20:18.264 --> 02:20:19.165]  Alpha lipoic acid
[02:20:20.117 --> 02:20:20.798]  I think so.
[02:20:38.313 --> 02:20:44.817]  Well, I've talked to Boyd Haley, he thinks that's a lot of baloney, but he says it's too large a molecule to get into.
[02:20:54.781 --> 02:20:56.082]  I was in a restaurant the other night.
[02:20:56.462 --> 02:20:57.743]  I whipped in to get something to eat alone.
[02:20:57.884 --> 02:20:59.725]  There were three different groups of people sitting around me.
[02:21:00.266 --> 02:21:03.708]  One group was talking about they were not that old of women, middle-aged, and had all their health problems.
[02:21:03.748 --> 02:21:08.132]  And one group, two other groups, were talking about how they all had thyroid problems.
[02:21:09.013 --> 02:21:11.315]  So what is going on with thyroid and what's causing that?
[02:21:12.135 --> 02:21:14.757]  Well, one of the biggest offenders is fluoride.
[02:21:15.518 --> 02:21:19.001]  You know, they used to use fluoride a long time ago to treat hyperthyroidism.
[02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:25.034]  Well, of all the glands in the body, the thyroid accumulates the highest concentration of fluoride.
[02:21:25.054 --> 02:21:26.616]  It's much higher than any other organ.
[02:21:27.396 --> 02:21:35.243]  So it is, you know, that it's in the water and you're drinking it every day, you're accumulating a huge amount of fluoride in the thyroid.
[02:21:35.263 --> 02:21:36.384]  We're going back to the full audience.
[02:21:36.624 --> 02:21:37.345]  Full audience, here we go.
[02:21:41.618 --> 02:21:43.839]  Man, this show has gone by really fast.
[02:21:43.859 --> 02:21:46.821]  I've got to have the doctor back up for another hour and a half, two hours.
[02:21:47.421 --> 02:21:52.484]  In the near future, this radio transmission is almost over and I want to go to Brad and somebody calling themselves Dr. Tracy.
[02:21:53.344 --> 02:21:54.745]  I guess they're a doctor of some type.
[02:21:55.646 --> 02:22:02.870]  But briefly, Dr. Blalock, fire out your website again for folks to get books and videos on these subjects.
[02:22:02.890 --> 02:22:08.853]  Alright, it's Russell Blalock, M-D dot com, R-U-S-S-E-L-L.
[02:22:09.381 --> 02:22:10.943]  We're good to go.
[02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:28.033]  But, and also some of the papers I've published, I've put on there, that you can directly download.
[02:22:28.073 --> 02:22:33.515]  Dr. Warren, we're going to come right back to you in one minute, and I think take a final call from Dr. Tracy, because I want to hear what they have to say.
[02:22:33.535 --> 02:22:38.497]  But before I do that, remember that this hour was brought to you by MySolarBackup.com.
[02:22:38.537 --> 02:22:39.698]  We couldn't do it without these sponsors.
[02:22:39.718 --> 02:22:45.561]  These are great folks from our good friends at Solutions for Science, with a great catalog of products.
[02:22:45.601 --> 02:22:46.281]  But this is an 1800 watt
[02:22:49.042 --> 02:22:54.724]  Power source, power plant and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:22:54.744 --> 02:22:56.064]  That's right, it generates free electricity.
[02:22:56.544 --> 02:22:57.925]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:22:57.945 --> 02:22:58.625]  Give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:22:58.725 --> 02:22:59.565]  Again, MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:23:08.508 --> 02:23:13.490]  And I believe in getting off the grid, or at least being self-sufficient, being on the grid, but also being able to go off the grid.
[02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:14.650]  This is a good way to start.
[02:23:14.670 --> 02:23:17.951]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:23:18.051 --> 02:23:22.452]  And again, sorry to interrupt you Dr. Blaylock, but that is how we fund this whole operation.
[02:23:22.492 --> 02:23:26.633]  That's why I hope people go to your website as well and support you.
[02:23:26.653 --> 02:23:30.815]  We're going to put that up on PrisonPlanet.tv screen before this hour ends.
[02:23:31.115 --> 02:23:34.696]  Before I go to this final call, I just want to thank you, sir,
[02:23:35.296 --> 02:23:37.579]  Well, yes, and I thank you for all your valuable work.
[02:23:37.619 --> 02:23:38.439]  You do a tremendous amount.
[02:23:38.460 --> 02:23:39.541]  You know a lot.
[02:23:39.581 --> 02:23:40.281]  It's valuable information.
[02:23:53.769 --> 02:24:00.691]  Well, I mean, I'm not even that smart of a person, but how would I, I mean, knowing that there's this evil elite doing this, how would I not want to know all about it?
[02:24:00.711 --> 02:24:01.732]  I mean, how would you not want to know?
[02:24:01.752 --> 02:24:03.052]  That's what I can't believe about the public.
[02:24:03.112 --> 02:24:05.073]  I mean, this is real what we're talking about.
[02:24:05.793 --> 02:24:10.015]  I mean, even if people are doubting us, if there's a 1% chance we're telling the truth, don't they want to know?
[02:24:10.995 --> 02:24:17.797]  Well, the interesting thing is, is all they have to do is use their media and say, well, everybody who thinks it's a conspiracy is a nut.
[02:24:18.717 --> 02:24:20.618]  And that way they won't even look into it.
[02:24:20.798 --> 02:24:23.199]  And you can say, well, read this book, read this book,
[02:24:23.604 --> 02:24:24.544]  Read this material.
[02:24:24.584 --> 02:24:26.365]  Read this congressional report.
[02:24:27.065 --> 02:24:27.765]  They won't do it.
[02:24:28.125 --> 02:24:33.647]  Because they're lazy intellectually and it's easy just to say, oh, you're just a nut.
[02:24:34.047 --> 02:24:34.927]  And they're brain damaged.
[02:24:34.967 --> 02:24:36.788]  They've grown up in this eugenic system.
[02:24:37.648 --> 02:24:38.228]  That's true.
[02:24:38.768 --> 02:24:42.189]  But all they have to do is look at these authoritative sources.
[02:24:42.209 --> 02:24:44.930]  These are people high in government who are saying these things.
[02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:48.711]  These are professors that have been through the system.
[02:24:49.304 --> 02:24:50.866]  These are congressional hearings.
[02:24:51.266 --> 02:24:52.087]  Just read it.
[02:24:52.328 --> 02:24:53.709]  It's well documented.
[02:24:54.110 --> 02:24:54.530]  You know what?
[02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:56.833]  I have a capacity here to go into overdrive.
[02:24:57.073 --> 02:25:01.839]  Will you do five more minutes with us, overdrive on the show, so we can take a few more of these calls, Doctor?
[02:25:01.859 --> 02:25:02.660]  Sure.
[02:25:03.140 --> 02:25:04.902]  Okay, we're going to do five more minutes into overdrive.
[02:25:05.916 --> 02:25:11.257]  And then after the overdrive's over, folks, you can tune back into the restream at InfoWars.com or subscribe to the free podcast.
[02:25:11.897 --> 02:25:19.419]  But we'll go out of the show with Dr. Tracy from Utah and hold Dr. Tracy over as the show ends here in about 45 seconds.
[02:25:20.179 --> 02:25:21.519]  But we'll continue streaming on the web.
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:24.740]  Dr. Tracy in Utah, then we'll go to Brad and Angela, and that'll be it.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.441]  Dr. Tracy, go ahead and start your point.
[02:25:27.301 --> 02:25:28.061]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:25:28.081 --> 02:25:32.462]  It's been a long time since we've done a show together, but I want to thank you for having
[02:25:33.046 --> 02:25:35.907]  He's one of the greatest medical pioneers in our day.
[02:25:36.227 --> 02:25:38.127]  Well, remind me who you are, Dr. Tracy?
[02:25:39.268 --> 02:25:41.608]  I'm the expert on antidepressant medications.
[02:25:41.628 --> 02:25:42.088]  Prozac.
[02:25:42.248 --> 02:25:42.988]  Okay, yeah.
[02:25:43.028 --> 02:25:43.789]  And Pandora.
[02:25:44.429 --> 02:25:45.329]  Yeah.
[02:25:45.589 --> 02:25:48.330]  Dr. Blaylock has done an incredible job.
[02:25:48.450 --> 02:25:54.411]  I have always, always recommended his wonderful book, Excitotoxins, The Taste of Kills.
[02:25:55.071 --> 02:25:55.851]  Okay, hold it there.
[02:25:55.932 --> 02:25:56.332]  Hold it there.
[02:25:56.352 --> 02:25:57.952]  We're going into overdrive right now.
[02:25:58.112 --> 02:25:58.592]  One place.
[02:25:58.712 --> 02:26:00.613]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:26:01.033 --> 02:26:01.813]  So find the streams there.
[02:26:04.471 --> 02:26:05.992]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:26:06.973 --> 02:26:09.355]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:26:12.097 --> 02:26:15.339]  Okay, I'm going to continue, John.
[02:26:15.479 --> 02:26:17.381]  I'm just going to do about three minutes here and say bye.
[02:26:18.221 --> 02:26:19.542]  The network can do that, correct, John?
[02:26:22.945 --> 02:26:24.426]  That's fine, we'll do three minutes right now.
[02:26:24.766 --> 02:26:26.427]  Okay, finish up your point, Dr. Tracy.
[02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:32.692]  Dr. Tracy, did you want to finish your point with Dr. Blalock?
[02:26:34.011 --> 02:26:34.832]  I would love to.
[02:26:34.852 --> 02:26:35.512]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:26:35.532 --> 02:26:36.393]  We've got just a few minutes.
[02:26:36.413 --> 02:26:39.035]  Oh, right now?
[02:26:39.395 --> 02:26:40.015]  Yes, we're on air.
[02:26:41.136 --> 02:26:42.177]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:26:44.558 --> 02:26:49.582]  What I'd like to say is that everything that Dr. Blaylock has said is true.
[02:26:50.363 --> 02:27:00.410]  They are killing people at an incredible rate and if your listeners are not aware of hospice and how they are going in and
[02:27:01.557 --> 02:27:03.577]  Euthanizing many of the elderly.
[02:27:03.598 --> 02:27:09.279]  They need to go to HospicePatients.org because it's happening.
[02:27:10.119 --> 02:27:11.419]  HospicePatients.org?
[02:27:11.439 --> 02:27:18.541]  Well, that's even been in the Wall Street Journal with the Smith articles about how the people are chained down begging for food and water.
[02:27:18.781 --> 02:27:19.061]  Doctor?
[02:27:19.741 --> 02:27:20.361]  Exactly.
[02:27:20.921 --> 02:27:22.682]  We're in Dachau, Auschwitz.
[02:27:22.942 --> 02:27:26.303]  They're bringing Dachau and Auschwitz right into people's homes.
[02:27:26.483 --> 02:27:27.783]  Doctor Blalock, you were trying to say something?
[02:27:28.961 --> 02:27:55.142]  No, I was just listening, and I thank Dr. Tracy, but you know, we have to be a lot more alert to these things because they have very benign sounding names, a lot of these things, and they promote themselves as somebody who wants to do good and help with the problems of society, but you know, you have to be very critical in your observations to pick up these things.
[02:27:55.754 --> 02:27:59.336]  Dr. Tracey, send an email to Aaron with two A's at Infowars.com.
[02:27:59.376 --> 02:28:00.216]  It's producing right now.
[02:28:00.617 --> 02:28:02.277]  And I do remember interviewing you now years ago.
[02:28:02.297 --> 02:28:04.599]  It's been years and years, and perhaps we'll have you back on.
[02:28:04.639 --> 02:28:10.101]  And send that hospice address, because I do want to cover how they're killing the elderly and infirm.
[02:28:10.341 --> 02:28:15.104]  I know people here in Austin who have their parents taken away, and then they just go euthanize them, you know, kill them with morphine.
[02:28:16.184 --> 02:28:20.767]  And Dr. Blaylock, again, I just want to thank you for all the time that you've spent with us.
[02:28:20.847 --> 02:28:22.908]  Again, list some of your films and books in closing.
[02:28:23.902 --> 02:28:38.267]  Well, I appreciate it, but the main theme is nutrition and behavior, which goes into a lot of details about how to protect your children's brain as well as your own from these behavioral effects of the food.
[02:28:39.267 --> 02:28:44.249]  And Health and Nutrition Secrets that Can Save Your Life is one of the recent books.
[02:28:44.509 --> 02:28:49.171]  Natural Strategies for Cancer Patients is a recent book on cancer.
[02:28:49.971 --> 02:28:53.492]  And my original book, Excited Toxins, the Taste that Kills,
[02:28:54.258 --> 02:29:00.482]  And I have an e-booklet on how to survive nuclear radiation.
[02:29:01.723 --> 02:29:08.108]  I have a book on bioterrorism, which you can get through that website.
[02:29:08.188 --> 02:29:17.234]  The e-booklet on protection against radiation terrorism and radiation damage, I think people would be interested in.
[02:29:17.254 --> 02:29:20.777]  Very nicely done by my son.
[02:29:22.970 --> 02:29:28.672]  I have a newsletter, Blaylock Wellness Report, that's published by Newsmax.com.
[02:29:46.257 --> 02:29:47.578]  Sure, that'd be great.
[02:29:47.938 --> 02:29:50.060]  Alright, and thank you too Dr. Tracy for calling in.
[02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:55.104]  Well, Dr. Russell Blaylock, MD, we salute you and have a great New Year, sir.
[02:29:55.404 --> 02:29:56.085]  Thank you, you too.
[02:29:56.645 --> 02:29:57.346]  Thank you, bye bye.
[02:29:57.706 --> 02:29:59.928]  Go ahead and take us out of here boys with some outro music.
[02:29:59.948 --> 02:30:08.274]  I want to thank John for the great job that he is doing up there at the GCN Radio Network in Minnesota.
[02:30:08.514 --> 02:30:09.975]  We're down here in Austin, Texas.
[02:30:10.856 --> 02:30:18.823]  Rebroadcast starts now with a bunch of key info on Gaza Strip, what's really going on, how it's meant to expel and terrorize the Palestinians into leaving.
[02:30:18.923 --> 02:30:21.486]  Israel's own documents, own news, own admissions.
[02:30:21.526 --> 02:30:22.827]  Very, very serious issue there.
[02:30:23.147 --> 02:30:24.368]  We also get into the economy.
[02:30:24.909 --> 02:30:29.573]  Pat Robertson and getting behind the global warming garbage and saying socialism is taking over.
[02:30:29.613 --> 02:30:30.233]  It's a good thing.
[02:30:31.474 --> 02:30:32.796]  We even got into UFOs today.
[02:30:32.936 --> 02:30:35.218]  Big, giant, Homeland Security surveillance blimps.
[02:30:38.004 --> 02:30:42.487]  And they're telling the public that it's flying saucers.
[02:30:42.887 --> 02:30:45.128]  So just unbelievable how dumb they think the public is.
[02:30:46.049 --> 02:30:46.789]  Anyways, we're out of time.
[02:30:46.829 --> 02:30:47.590]  God bless you all.
[02:30:47.890 --> 02:30:52.312]  Rebroadcast starts right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:30:52.353 --> 02:30:52.693]  Get in there.
[02:30:52.713 --> 02:30:53.593]  Get the free podcast.
[02:30:53.613 --> 02:30:55.715]  Keep spreading the word about the YouTube videos.
[02:30:56.055 --> 02:30:59.697]  We are reaching millions a day just on the YouTubes alone now.
[02:31:00.017 --> 02:31:01.418]  I salute all of you for what you're doing.
[02:31:01.818 --> 02:31:02.639]  God bless you.
[02:31:02.879 --> 02:31:04.860]  Get out there and fight for humanity and our future.
[02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:05.941]  We don't have a choice.
[02:31:06.061 --> 02:31:06.401]  Take care.
[02:31:08.052 --> 02:31:11.013]  The mountains that we move.
[02:31:11.173 --> 02:31:12.153]  I'll be singing it going out.
[02:31:12.553 --> 02:31:14.354]  Caught like a wildfire.
[02:31:15.374 --> 02:31:16.534]  I love y'all folks.
[02:31:16.594 --> 02:31:18.795]  I feel so much love for my fellow man.
[02:31:20.235 --> 02:31:21.956]  And nothing left to lose.
[02:31:22.396 --> 02:31:27.257]  But I remember, remember what she said to me.
[02:31:28.338 --> 02:31:31.478]  How she swore that it would never end.
[02:31:34.419 --> 02:31:35.700]  I hope we're not running against the wind.
[02:31:35.720 --> 02:31:38.982]  I hope we can turn this around, or we don't have any future.
[02:31:39.363 --> 02:31:43.385]  What I didn't know then, against the wind.
[02:31:43.405 --> 02:31:45.347]  Alright, I'm outta here.
[02:31:45.927 --> 02:31:46.908]  Gotta have some fun.
[02:31:47.028 --> 02:31:47.508]  I love ya.
[02:31:47.548 --> 02:31:49.089]  We're gonna defeat tyranny together.
[02:31:49.429 --> 02:31:50.050]  Vaya con Dios.
