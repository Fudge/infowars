[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.383]  Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:07.031]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:15.068]  I am here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:15.088 --> 00:00:15.908]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:16.988]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:18.689]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:19.329]  Eastern.
[00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:30.172]  We always simulcast in the last two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv when the radio show, the syndicated radio broadcast, shifts gears and becomes a television show as well.
[00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:35.920]  I have a huge news blitz I want to go over now, then we'll continue with your phone calls.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.225]  Then Dr. Webster Griffin Tarbley, Doctor of History and Economics, is joining us for 30 minutes in the last hour to detail a
[00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:56.340]  Massively researched piece he wrote for Infowars.com asking the question, was the Fort Hood shooter a patsy part of a drill?
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.661]  And the evidence shows that is the case.
[00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:01.162]  So that's coming up later in the last hour.
[00:01:01.222 --> 00:01:03.983]  Also my review of The Watchman.
[00:01:04.023 --> 00:01:06.644]  I saw it a few months ago in the theater.
[00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:07.465]  I now have the DVD.
[00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:14.868]  I'm going to play a few minutes of it from the end where this secret society stages terror attacks worldwide.
[00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:27.382]  To then bring in a world government for world peace, and Dr. Manhattan, the good guy, decides, oh, I see, I love it that you nuked a bunch of cities and killed a bunch of people.
[00:01:27.442 --> 00:01:28.303]  That's loving!
[00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:30.424]  The end justifies the means.
[00:01:30.504 --> 00:01:39.591]  So, massively evil, total Illuminati programming, but this will give you an idea of their mindset as they give the public the revelation of the method.
[00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:41.172]  But as I walked out of the theater,
[00:01:41.812 --> 00:01:48.638]  People all around are saying, I don't get it, I don't understand, and all these editorials and all these articles said no one gets The Watchman.
[00:01:48.998 --> 00:01:50.079]  No one understands it.
[00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.660]  It's clear in your face.
[00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:57.065]  A five-year-old should be able to understand this, but people have a compulsion to not see the truth.
[00:01:57.865 --> 00:01:58.066]  So...
[00:01:59.298 --> 00:02:00.099]  That is coming up.
[00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.922]  Also, IMF head eyes global currency change, presses on yuan.
[00:02:05.523 --> 00:02:07.404]  So they're now moving away from the dollar.
[00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:09.186]  This is going to be devastating.
[00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:12.388]  You think the economy's bad with really over 20% unemployment.
[00:02:12.668 --> 00:02:13.749]  Government says over 10.
[00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:15.911]  All the big mainline economists say over 20.
[00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:17.432]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:20.394]  It could all stop if we remove the New World Order bankers.
[00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:25.218]  I'm identifying them, not the liberals, not the conservatives, not their puppets.
[00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:36.052]  But phase one in ending the Fed, removing the economic dictatorship, is first shattering the left-right paradigm so people understand that Republicans come and go.
[00:02:36.432 --> 00:02:44.154]  But the eugenics empire run by the big banks, the eco-science system that the White House science czar talks about remains the same.
[00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:50.275]  But I did want to have a bit of a light moment here on air today.
[00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:55.710]  In my hand, I'm holding a new form of toilet paper.
[00:02:56.631 --> 00:03:04.878]  And in the last decade or so, I've seen Republicans and Conservatives and Libertarians put out paper that has the United Nations symbol on it.
[00:03:05.558 --> 00:03:07.880]  And I've seen them put it out that has Democrats on it.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.044]  Or I've seen the Liberals put out toilet paper that has George Bush on it.
[00:03:15.346 --> 00:03:19.750]  But we're now seeing a bellwether of toilet paper selling all over the Internet.
[00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:49.995]  That does have Bank Pork Frank, Fraud Dodd, Bankster, Palsy Pelosi, Greedy Reed, Bankster Buddy Obama, Beltway, Backroom Biden, but then it says SEC No Evil Cox, McPork McCain, Allen Fraud Scam, Ben Bankster Buddy Bailout Bernanke,
[00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:52.422]  Ka-ching Cheney.
[00:03:53.242 --> 00:03:55.403]  Bankster Buddy Bush the Moron.
[00:03:56.564 --> 00:03:58.565]  It's bipartisan toilet paper!
[00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:01.487]  I remember years ago saying we need toilet paper.
[00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:04.989]  But they do take themselves a little too seriously.
[00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:09.892]  This is from BanksterBuster.com.
[00:04:11.273 --> 00:04:13.174]  We want to thank Dave for sending us this.
[00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:15.775]  I was sent two rolls.
[00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.337]  We will use this in the office.
[00:04:19.568 --> 00:04:22.851]  Back today, we'll go put these on the rolls if you guys are happy with it.
[00:04:23.872 --> 00:04:25.193]  And here we are.
[00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:27.194]  But it is a bellwether.
[00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:28.115]  People are getting it.
[00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:30.737]  And I went and looked after I saw this this morning.
[00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:33.219]  There's lots of brands of bipartisan toilet paper.
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.480]  Throw the bums out.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.301]  They're all puppets.
[00:04:35.661 --> 00:04:41.486]  Except for people like Ron Paul who transcend the left-right paradigm and point out the real power structure.
[00:04:41.827 --> 00:04:44.209]  Stuff like Anna Nicole Smith isn't what's important.
[00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:45.630]  Or OJ Simpson.
[00:04:47.472 --> 00:04:48.913]  This is what is important.
[00:04:49.193 --> 00:04:50.534]  Shattering the left-right paradigm.
[00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:53.776]  So, very, very, very excited.
[00:04:53.796 --> 00:04:55.117]  In fact, I need to sneeze.
[00:04:55.157 --> 00:04:57.379]  Maybe I should use it as a tissue.
[00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:00.821]  Okay.
[00:05:01.742 --> 00:05:02.963]  Thought I'd have a little bit of fun there.
[00:05:06.792 --> 00:05:18.278]  Let's now go ahead and get into a news blitz here, and then back to Jim, Jerry, Steve, Gabe, Mike, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:34.527]  Paul Watson wrote a story about this, but it's in the BBC, it's in the Surrey newspaper, it's all over the British news, and they are reporting it like it is a
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.882]  Good thing.
[00:05:37.623 --> 00:05:38.145]  Guilty.
[00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:45.262]  Paul Clark faces at least five years in prison, that's the minimum sentence, for handing in a discarded shotgun.
[00:05:47.335 --> 00:05:50.396]  This is out of the Surrey newspaper.
[00:05:51.057 --> 00:05:53.357]  You guys printed me a printer version.
[00:05:53.377 --> 00:05:57.539]  Can I have the actual official version so people can see the letterhead and the news article?
[00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:00.580]  They don't tend to believe it unless it's from an official letterhead.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.041]  However, this printer didn't print right.
[00:06:02.621 --> 00:06:09.264]  But you can also read a story that gives you a larger perspective on this at PrisonPlanet.com, written by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:15.907]  And it says, in his backyard, he saw a black shotgun.
[00:06:16.721 --> 00:06:17.702]  So he called the police.
[00:06:17.742 --> 00:06:19.443]  He's a military veteran, no criminal record.
[00:06:20.144 --> 00:06:20.924]  See, you served them.
[00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:21.765]  That's why they don't like you.
[00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:23.586]  That's who they're worried about.
[00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:24.567]  You've served them now.
[00:06:24.587 --> 00:06:25.688]  Now they want to give you a record.
[00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:29.991]  And he calls the police department and says, I'm going to bring this gun down to you.
[00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:30.912]  And they were waiting for him.
[00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.774]  And they said, touching a gun is illegal.
[00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:44.062]  The jury was instructed to convict him, being total 1984 puppets that would make Hitler proud and Stalin proud and Mao as well.
[00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:54.362]  They have a quote in here by the prosecutor, Brian Stalk, explained to the jury that possession of a firearm was a strict liability charge.
[00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:55.963]  See, it's this term.
[00:06:56.403 --> 00:06:59.065]  There's the actual article, Surrey Today, one of many.
[00:07:01.586 --> 00:07:03.307]  That's what zero tolerance is about.
[00:07:03.347 --> 00:07:08.511]  It's about targeting the mainstream, targeting people that are good, to terrorize them.
[00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:10.152]  That's the essence of their mind control.
[00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:15.838]  He said, therefore, Mr. Clark's allegedly honest intent was irrelevant.
[00:07:16.638 --> 00:07:22.359]  Just by having the gun in his possession, he was guilty of the charge and has no defense in law against it, he added.
[00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:27.220]  But despite this, Mr. Blackman urged members of the jury to consider how they would respond if they found the gun.
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.141]  He said, this is a very small case with a very big principle.
[00:07:31.381 --> 00:07:35.582]  So they're saying they're making an example out of him.
[00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.326]  And he'll be sentenced December 11th.
[00:07:39.346 --> 00:07:43.430]  The minimum sentence is five years in prison and a hefty fine.
[00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.632]  Go read the articles at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:07:46.652 --> 00:07:47.613]  We have links to the article.
[00:07:47.653 --> 00:07:54.119]  We wrote our own story about it and added the articles of where people defend themselves with a knife when they're being attacked in their house.
[00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:55.600]  They get thrown in prison.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.581]  The rapist gets released.
[00:07:59.383 --> 00:08:00.504]  We are the milk cows.
[00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:01.565]  We are the slaves.
[00:08:02.105 --> 00:08:05.388]  We are the aphids that the ants keep, basically milk.
[00:08:06.662 --> 00:08:13.048]  And it's meant to be absurdist.
[00:08:13.128 --> 00:08:14.329]  It's meant to be over-the-top.
[00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:19.234]  It's meant to shock us and train us to accept even more corruption and evil.
[00:08:20.055 --> 00:08:21.035]  It's like this army
[00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:26.670]  Enlisted lady who had a baby and they CPS'ed it and said you're not allowed to have babies while you're in the military.
[00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.252]  We're CPS'ing your baby and you're going back to Afghanistan.
[00:08:30.812 --> 00:08:32.273]  No other government's ever done that.
[00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:33.433]  The Soviets didn't do that.
[00:08:33.473 --> 00:08:34.474]  The Nazis didn't do that.
[00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.694]  The Israelis don't do that.
[00:08:36.014 --> 00:08:37.135]  The Cubans don't do that.
[00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:38.255]  The Germans don't do that.
[00:08:38.315 --> 00:08:39.276]  The British don't do that.
[00:08:40.689 --> 00:08:41.410]  It's absurd.
[00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:51.838]  It's like England announcing in many cities, you've got to have a license to be outdoors with your kid and be certified by the government that you're allowed to be with your child in public because you may be a pedophile.
[00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:53.500]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:00.385]  Everything for the children, but then real pedophiles and the UN who've been caught running giant child kidnapping rings, they don't get in trouble.
[00:09:02.447 --> 00:09:06.831]  You see how they're training you to just accept unbelievably ridiculous things?
[00:09:08.412 --> 00:09:09.113]  You understand?
[00:09:10.307 --> 00:09:12.029]  How and why this is being done?
[00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:18.698]  Do you understand what this larger system is really all about?
[00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:23.584]  I mean, are you ready to understand that you're being conditioned and trained to accept more and more?
[00:09:23.925 --> 00:09:26.849]  It's like what happened two months ago at the G20.
[00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:33.171]  One of the activists was using Twitter when the police went down to the University Park.
[00:09:33.591 --> 00:09:34.932]  Most people weren't even protesting.
[00:09:34.972 --> 00:09:36.433]  It was a Friday night.
[00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:38.454]  I had three reporters there.
[00:09:38.534 --> 00:09:39.394]  One of them got arrested.
[00:09:39.414 --> 00:09:40.235]  Rob Dew got arrested.
[00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:41.716]  Burmas barely made it out.
[00:09:42.776 --> 00:09:49.000]  Bermas was, I told Bermas that night, he called me, I said, they're encircling the park, they're gonna arrest everybody, get out now.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.422]  Jason, listen to me, I couldn't get a hold of Dew.
[00:09:51.822 --> 00:09:58.847]  Dew was there with the mainstream media, they let them out, but arrested him, then put a bunch of false charges on him that we're now beating in court.
[00:09:59.047 --> 00:10:00.728]  They even got the wrong day of his arrest in.
[00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:03.170]  We have video of what happened.
[00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.551]  They didn't erase the tapes, thank God.
[00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:06.112]  They did erase some people's tapes.
[00:10:06.972 --> 00:10:10.655]  They beat up and tortured Luke Radowski, had the military do it in a state prison.
[00:10:11.115 --> 00:10:12.356]  I mean, it was hellish for him.
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:23.442]  But why did they, in broad daylight on the Wednesday before that Friday, two days before, why did they go around with loudspeakers blurring?
[00:10:23.482 --> 00:10:25.123]  No one's allowed on the streets of Pittsburgh.
[00:10:25.503 --> 00:10:32.225]  Why did they drive up and hit with sound cannons nine-year-old kids with their footballs in their front yards?
[00:10:32.285 --> 00:10:34.565]  We have video of them driving around neighborhoods.
[00:10:35.366 --> 00:10:36.686]  Why did they use police dogs?
[00:10:36.866 --> 00:10:40.687]  Old ladies came out of a store with bags and were like, officer, what's wrong?
[00:10:40.747 --> 00:10:42.327]  Get the bleep out of here, lady.
[00:10:42.668 --> 00:10:44.128]  Releases the dogs to bite them.
[00:10:45.154 --> 00:10:50.496]  They would chase down, because they couldn't find anybody who was violating the curfew to not be on the streets day or night.
[00:10:51.336 --> 00:11:01.439]  It was all randomly enforced, so they went to the university where the college kids were, and girls would run on bikes, and the police would run up, we showed the video, and knock them off, and then beat them with blood spewing out of their heads.
[00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:04.740]  And the cops are like, what, you don't like law enforcement, commie?
[00:11:07.273 --> 00:11:09.894]  So all of this is going on.
[00:11:10.114 --> 00:11:11.134]  All of this is happening.
[00:11:11.235 --> 00:11:13.535]  It's meant to be absurd.
[00:11:14.156 --> 00:11:16.637]  It's meant to be over the top.
[00:11:17.117 --> 00:11:19.918]  It's meant to be, why are police dogs biting old ladies?
[00:11:20.198 --> 00:11:25.380]  Why are police dogs in public schools with the kids lined up in random searches biting and ripping the bags open?
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:32.743]  Why are they tasering old women and pregnant women who ask why they have to, you know, sign a ticket or argue and say they weren't speeding?
[00:11:33.523 --> 00:11:36.164]  Why are they arresting a veteran who brings a shotgun in
[00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:41.746]  He calls them and says, I got a shotgun, and they're there waiting to pounce on him, saying you're not allowed to touch it.
[00:11:42.086 --> 00:11:45.227]  They want to train you to just be paralyzed and go, I'll do whatever you say!
[00:11:45.827 --> 00:11:46.728]  I'll do whatever you say!
[00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:49.308]  And they admit, we're making an example out of you.
[00:11:50.349 --> 00:11:57.871]  That's why people will bring Dixie cups and knives to school to have a pie, and they'll arrest them saying they had knives.
[00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:05.350]  A question for you.
[00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:07.654]  Do you know what is in the air you're breathing?
[00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:11.359]  Do you know what chemicals are placed in the water you drink?
[00:12:11.719 --> 00:12:14.042]  Would you like to combat these intrusions?
[00:12:14.443 --> 00:12:15.885]  I'm not just talking toxins.
[00:12:16.085 --> 00:12:18.628]  I'm talking about chemicals that are harmful.
[00:12:18.869 --> 00:12:21.813]  Maybe now you understand why you feel tired so much.
[00:12:22.313 --> 00:12:24.775]  Change your life with LifeChange Tea.

[00:12:54.437 --> 00:12:55.237]  Get the T.com
[00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:01.101]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:13:01.261 --> 00:13:02.041]  Spy on me?
[00:13:02.122 --> 00:13:02.402]  Yeah.
[00:13:02.442 --> 00:13:07.346]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:08.947]  You should use StartPage instead.
[00:13:09.107 --> 00:13:09.768]  StartPage?
[00:13:09.868 --> 00:13:11.269]  Yeah, StartPage.com.
[00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:14.191]  The new name for XQuick, the world's most private search engine.
[00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:18.054]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:21.077]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:13:21.337 --> 00:13:23.678]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.439]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:25.759]  Right!
[00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:28.861]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:13:29.161 --> 00:13:29.681]  Hello, folks.
[00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:30.682]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:13:31.082 --> 00:13:34.624]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:13:34.944 --> 00:13:38.566]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:13:38.726 --> 00:13:43.668]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:13:43.868 --> 00:13:46.790]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.813]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:13:49.014 --> 00:13:52.942]  Try StartPage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:13:53.323 --> 00:13:54.505]  That's StartPage.com
[00:13:58.883 --> 00:14:05.086]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:14:05.567 --> 00:14:13.331]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:14:13.671 --> 00:14:21.515]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:14:21.835 --> 00:14:26.600]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.644]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:14:32.165 --> 00:14:36.008]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:37.530]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.614]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:14:42.074 --> 00:14:46.455]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:14:46.995 --> 00:14:49.536]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:14:49.976 --> 00:14:52.096]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:55.177]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:55.317 --> 00:14:59.318]  The once mighty U.S.
[00:14:59.358 --> 00:15:01.959]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:04.980]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.800]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.680]  We're good to go.
[00:15:32.293 --> 00:15:36.596]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you're buying Factory Direct at wholesale prices.
[00:15:37.076 --> 00:15:38.957]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:15:39.277 --> 00:15:42.259]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you free of charge.
[00:15:42.719 --> 00:15:42.999]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:43.079]  1-800-453-2202.
[00:15:43.099 --> 00:15:45.221]  Or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[00:15:45.241 --> 00:15:46.061]  Factory Direct.
[00:15:46.081 --> 00:15:47.662]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:15:47.682 --> 00:15:48.102]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:13.149]  Was a prisoner of doubt.
[00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.990]  Not anymore.
[00:16:18.031 --> 00:16:20.111]  I'm gonna risk my life fighting these tyrants.
[00:16:20.171 --> 00:16:21.492]  I'm gonna give them 110%.
[00:16:22.612 --> 00:16:27.253]  I love that term 110% because you can always give more.
[00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:30.254]  You can always do more than you thought you could.
[00:16:30.774 --> 00:16:32.195]  The mind has a governor.
[00:16:32.215 --> 00:16:36.096]  It's like a race car or a lawnmower.
[00:16:38.716 --> 00:16:40.957]  The globalists know you have amazing power.
[00:16:42.346 --> 00:16:45.952]  And they're afraid of you turning it loose against them.
[00:16:45.992 --> 00:16:49.177]  We're coming straight on.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.741]  The gambler understands.
[00:17:19.665 --> 00:17:28.351]  Okay, I just spent about 10 minutes on one article and as you can see I've probably got 20 or more here in the stack.
[00:17:29.472 --> 00:17:30.973]  Gonna do a Rush Limbaugh imitation.
[00:17:34.055 --> 00:17:38.317]  That's the audio version of holding up the stack on TV.
[00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:45.527]  Let me try to go through this as quickly as possible, but each one of these is just so important.
[00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:53.711]  Task Force opposes routine mammograms for women ages 40 to 49.
[00:17:58.223 --> 00:18:04.867]  Now again, it's not just what I'm about to cover, it's the understanding of these people, and you can get the same understanding.
[00:18:04.947 --> 00:18:27.561]  I know CNN's flavor of poison, and I knew when I read this, I already knew this report was issued because of all the other big reports by prestigious scientific organizations that aren't compartmentalized and have good scientists in them, that mammograms have been conclusively linked for more than a decade to the early onset of particularly aggressive breast cancers.
[00:18:29.045 --> 00:18:33.488]  Malignant tumors.
[00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:46.619]  And I knew when I read it, it was going to be a whitewash because lately there's been a bunch of news out where they're admitting you shouldn't get mammograms until you're above the age of 50 because the danger of cancer from the mammograms
[00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:50.176]  Outweighs the danger of getting cancer normally.
[00:18:50.516 --> 00:19:03.820]  And that's a whole other subject of the hormones in the food and the water, the same hormones that feminize men, over-feminize women, cause hormonal imbalances, soy, fluoride, mercury, and the list goes on and on.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.081]  So it's not just mammograms giving you cancer.
[00:19:06.401 --> 00:19:08.482]  It's not just cell phones increasing brain cancer.
[00:19:08.702 --> 00:19:17.085]  Though it's now completely confirmed, and it turns out in 1981, when they were certifying the latest cell phone technologies that they knew then, the internal
[00:19:17.785 --> 00:19:25.109]  Telephone companies and technology companies that developed it, they knew, just like they knew Prozac made people commit suicide and go nuts.
[00:19:25.569 --> 00:19:26.489]  Homicidal mania.
[00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.452]  But there's several articles here, there's several points.
[00:19:31.592 --> 00:19:32.973]  I knew what it was going to say before I read it.
[00:19:33.093 --> 00:19:35.454]  And I read, and it said, oh yeah,
[00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:46.571]  They're saying they still recommend it for women 50 to 74, but they don't recommend it for women 40 to 49, but they don't say why it's recommended.
[00:19:46.611 --> 00:19:53.735]  Well, I just put in the search box, mammogram cancer risk, and got hundreds and hundreds of articles.
[00:19:53.795 --> 00:19:55.536]  I quit looking after about 30 minutes.
[00:19:55.576 --> 00:19:56.617]  I had more research to do.
[00:19:56.977 --> 00:19:57.617]  Couldn't sleep!
[00:20:01.399 --> 00:20:04.101]  Wanting to fight the new world order.
[00:20:07.157 --> 00:20:08.677]  And the first article popped up.
[00:20:08.757 --> 00:20:09.637]  I just printed one.
[00:20:09.678 --> 00:20:11.018]  You can go read hundreds if you'd like.
[00:20:11.358 --> 00:20:12.058]  Read the studies.
[00:20:12.418 --> 00:20:14.958]  Mammograms can increase breast cancer risk.
[00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:19.679]  Here's the Mail Online 2006, major newspaper.
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.900]  And Natural News had an article.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.081]  Mammograms offer no health benefits whatsoever, doctors conclude.
[00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:30.341]  And then they have all the links to the actual studies.
[00:20:31.061 --> 00:20:33.702]  An increase in breast cancer in study after study.
[00:20:35.117 --> 00:20:35.857]  Go to this article.
[00:20:35.917 --> 00:20:37.598]  It's the best one I found that had a boil down.
[00:20:38.119 --> 00:20:42.841]  I like natural news because they're similar to us in that they do articles that are just every line is links.
[00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:45.383]  Every line is links to documents.
[00:20:45.423 --> 00:20:46.423]  I just love that.
[00:20:46.804 --> 00:20:48.464]  I just love ramming that down their throat.
[00:20:48.524 --> 00:20:50.025]  Oh, I'm a conspiracy theorist, huh?
[00:20:51.986 --> 00:20:53.447]  That Mike Adams knows what he's doing.
[00:20:53.487 --> 00:20:53.827]  I love him.
[00:20:54.808 --> 00:20:55.748]  Love that whole crew over there.
[00:20:56.289 --> 00:20:58.170]  So they're doing a great job saving a lot of people.
[00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.932]  So when you wonder why your daughter's like, maybe you don't need that.
[00:21:02.232 --> 00:21:03.593]  They've been giving them to 20 year old women.
[00:21:04.773 --> 00:21:06.854]  They also do a lot of false positives.
[00:21:07.634 --> 00:21:14.317]  I've got members of my family who had biopsies done on their lungs and it would collapse their lung or break their ribs with a rib separator and almost kill them.
[00:21:14.638 --> 00:21:20.220]  They cut my grandmother's lung out, didn't have cancer in it, and that killed her a few years later from all the complications.
[00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:25.943]  Most of these breast cancer tumors they removed were not cancerous.
[00:21:28.337 --> 00:21:29.817]  And they screw the women up that way.
[00:21:30.117 --> 00:21:35.059]  The chemotherapy drugs they give them, then give them a bunch of different blood disorders, autoimmune diseases.
[00:21:35.519 --> 00:21:41.300]  Most of the leukemias you see are now being triggered by the chemotherapy.
[00:21:42.841 --> 00:21:45.941]  I got chemotherapy killing a family member right now.
[00:21:46.682 --> 00:21:47.302]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:47.322 --> 00:21:47.682]  Stay with us.
[00:21:49.702 --> 00:21:50.583]  We're on the march.
[00:21:51.083 --> 00:21:52.683]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:53.623 --> 00:21:56.304]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:59.534 --> 00:22:02.136]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:22:02.557 --> 00:22:07.521]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:22:07.882 --> 00:22:09.603]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:22:09.923 --> 00:22:14.748]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:22:14.928 --> 00:22:15.849]  How much do you want?
[00:22:16.089 --> 00:22:16.850]  When do you want it?
[00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.831]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:22:19.111 --> 00:22:19.932]  When will you need it?
[00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:22.253]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:22:22.373 --> 00:22:23.494]  Will there be any food?
[00:22:23.714 --> 00:22:25.055]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:22:25.255 --> 00:22:30.319]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:22:30.519 --> 00:22:33.701]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:22:34.101 --> 00:22:37.564]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:22:37.924 --> 00:22:38.904]  How much will you need?
[00:22:39.144 --> 00:22:39.764]  We don't know.
[00:22:40.045 --> 00:22:40.945]  How much do you want?
[00:22:41.145 --> 00:22:41.885]  All you can get.
[00:22:42.085 --> 00:22:42.925]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:43.165 --> 00:22:45.946]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:22:46.226 --> 00:22:47.987]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:22:48.007 --> 00:22:48.907]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:22:58.533 --> 00:23:03.700]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.783]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:23:05.903 --> 00:23:08.206]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:08.366 --> 00:23:10.209]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:10.629 --> 00:23:12.011]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:12.271 --> 00:23:13.313]  There is a solution.
[00:23:13.513 --> 00:23:21.535]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:23:21.935 --> 00:23:29.017]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:23:29.397 --> 00:23:35.059]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[00:23:35.419 --> 00:23:36.720]  I love their Nutri Cafe.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:41.021]  Great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:45.263]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:23:45.603 --> 00:23:49.964]  Go to ENERFOOD.com or give them a call right now.
[00:23:49.985 --> 00:23:52.746]  866-762-9238.
[00:23:53.066 --> 00:23:56.367]  Click on their banner at InfoWars.com to see all the available discounts.
[00:23:58.456 --> 00:24:05.318]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:24:05.458 --> 00:24:06.699]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:24:06.719 --> 00:24:07.399]  It's very real.

[00:25:07.711 --> 00:25:08.874]  We are back live.
[00:25:08.914 --> 00:25:11.800]  I'm going to continue with my news blitz and then your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:21.731]  I have done two and a half hours of radio broadcasts and haven't really plugged any of our sponsors that make this show possible.
[00:25:22.171 --> 00:25:23.851]  Please write down their names and numbers.
[00:25:23.971 --> 00:25:26.713]  Please think about supporting our sponsors.
[00:25:27.493 --> 00:25:32.475]  I mean, Rob Dew, I'm having to pay thousands of dollars to get his court case dismissed in Pittsburgh.
[00:25:33.115 --> 00:25:43.720]  Even though he was peacefully there videotaping, they let the mainstream TV stations out of the cordon and arrested him and then charged him with a bunch of crimes and put the wrong date on it and the wrong place.
[00:25:44.608 --> 00:25:45.769]  On the other side of the city.
[00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:49.371]  And I'm not whining, I just... We need your support.
[00:25:50.332 --> 00:25:54.015]  That's why I have produced... I don't have a copy of it in front of me.
[00:25:54.075 --> 00:25:54.555]  Oh, here's one.
[00:25:57.337 --> 00:26:00.679]  That's why I have produced Fall of the Republic.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.621]  And here's the new cover for the second printing.
[00:26:03.871 --> 00:26:16.262]  This is the film exposing who the globalists are, how they're criminal, how they engineered the banking collapse, the different operations they're engaged in, how they're planning to bring in the global carbon tax, the gun control, the open borders.
[00:26:16.282 --> 00:26:18.303]  I mean, this film is incredible.
[00:26:18.704 --> 00:26:21.186]  We have an illegitimate criminal government.
[00:26:21.526 --> 00:26:25.690]  We must get the word out about this or we're going to go into deeper and deeper tyranny.
[00:26:27.856 --> 00:26:35.272]  And I cannot stress enough how important Fall of the Republic is, and how when you purchase it, you also support future filmmaking and what we're doing here.
[00:26:35.332 --> 00:26:37.878]  Now look, it's the holidays.
[00:26:37.938 --> 00:26:38.479]  It's Christmas.
[00:26:40.148 --> 00:26:42.569]  We've got discounts where you can get Aaron Russo.
[00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:45.470]  This is a film I just released, what, six, seven months ago.
[00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:54.694]  The last interview he did before he died, last video interview, and the extras are the last radio interviews he did with me, where he laid down what Nick Rockefeller told him, everything.
[00:26:54.794 --> 00:26:59.436]  The IRS, the Federal Reserve, it's all exposed in Reflections and Warning.
[00:26:59.717 --> 00:27:04.199]  You can get this free with a whole bunch of different combo deals we have at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:04.239 --> 00:27:07.140]  You can get it free with Fall of the Republic, free with Endgame.
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.321]  Free with the Obama Deception.
[00:27:09.341 --> 00:27:12.904]  We've got a bunch of different combo deals at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:14.104 --> 00:27:20.388]  You can also see Reflections and Warnings and Follow the Republic and the David Icke hour-long interview exclusive we did.
[00:27:21.749 --> 00:27:23.190]  Five and a half years of media.
[00:27:24.191 --> 00:27:27.893]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all my films at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:27:28.674 --> 00:27:35.999]  And we're running a special that we run every year in November and December where you get five months free
[00:27:37.939 --> 00:27:39.802]  It's five plus, it comes up to five and a half months.
[00:27:40.243 --> 00:27:45.810]  Normally, you know, you already get a discount when you get a yearly membership instead of a monthly membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:27:45.891 --> 00:27:47.613]  It's 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[00:27:48.314 --> 00:27:52.119]  It comes down to like, I don't have the numbers in front of me, three and a half bucks a month.
[00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.411]  Or close to half off.
[00:27:56.271 --> 00:28:00.193]  When you... That's just a special I came up with four years ago.
[00:28:00.213 --> 00:28:01.873]  We used to have the same special, same price.
[00:28:02.434 --> 00:28:03.814]  It only happens this time of year.
[00:28:04.695 --> 00:28:07.095]  If you are a member, it's time to resubscribe for the year.
[00:28:07.396 --> 00:28:10.177]  If you're not a member, you want to do a trial, it's $5.95.
[00:28:10.697 --> 00:28:13.258]  That pays for the bandwidth, the equipment, the crew.
[00:28:13.698 --> 00:28:15.599]  I got three people out there running this TV show.
[00:28:15.619 --> 00:28:16.359]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:28:16.379 --> 00:28:22.962]  I'm saying if you believe in what we're doing, and you believe in the mission we're carrying out, and you believe in what we've got hanging over the edge here,
[00:28:23.888 --> 00:28:31.632]  Then please become a PrisonPlanet.tv member, either a trial monthly or go get a yearly and get five and a half months free right now.
[00:28:31.992 --> 00:28:34.333]  So you pay for six and a half months, you get five and a half months free.
[00:28:35.134 --> 00:28:36.874]  It's like $34, $35 for a year.
[00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:38.935]  Normally it's $59.95.
[00:28:39.516 --> 00:28:46.879]  Point is, ladies and gentlemen, is that it's all available at PrisonPlanet.tv and peruse the huge shopping cart.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.682]  T-shirts, books, movies, the best films I see, great T-shirt designs.
[00:28:53.677 --> 00:28:56.518]  We have a little bit of the Obama Joker shirts.
[00:28:56.578 --> 00:29:01.380]  I pulled them off for a while while I was assessing how many we had left so that we didn't have to reprint any.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.880]  When these are gone, they're gone.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.340]  They're going back up in the next few days.
[00:29:04.741 --> 00:29:08.742]  All available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:29:08.762 --> 00:29:08.862]  888-253-3139.
[00:29:08.882 --> 00:29:13.223]  We're not funded by David Rockefeller or George Soros or Al Gore or the federal government.
[00:29:18.365 --> 00:29:21.507]  Like all the mainstream TV networks are putting out their propaganda now admitting it.
[00:29:21.567 --> 00:29:25.309]  Totally illegal according to the Congressional Budget Office and the General Accounting Office.
[00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:27.330]  They have rulings that it's illegal.
[00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.410]  In fact, people don't believe that.
[00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:37.935]  Google, General Accounting Office rules that White House paid press releases are illegal.
[00:29:38.115 --> 00:29:40.056]  That's what they call them, video press releases.
[00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:49.657]  General Accounting Office rules, White House purchasing, news illegal.
[00:29:50.238 --> 00:29:50.638]  Try that.
[00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:52.060]  And that was back during Bush.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.322]  It's many times worse now.
[00:29:53.342 --> 00:29:54.224]  I mean, it's insane.
[00:29:54.724 --> 00:29:56.186]  We aren't funded by that.
[00:29:57.349 --> 00:30:00.612]  We're funded by our sponsors, by the products I sell, by your donations.
[00:30:00.893 --> 00:30:02.054]  And see it as a donation.
[00:30:02.074 --> 00:30:05.557]  I mean, you're giving to the cause when you get the books and videos and materials.
[00:30:05.938 --> 00:30:06.158]  So 888-253-3139.
[00:30:06.178 --> 00:30:08.040]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, InfoWars, at P.O.
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:08.180]  Box 19549.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:08.901]  That's P.O.
[00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:09.622]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:30:23.482 --> 00:30:25.023]  And we try to have some reserves here.
[00:30:25.044 --> 00:30:26.805]  We try to be good stewards of the support.
[00:30:27.386 --> 00:30:31.550]  We try to be set up to withstand legal attacks, anything else that ever comes.
[00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:32.651]  Knock on wood, they haven't.
[00:30:33.411 --> 00:30:38.336]  Except for having to get our guys out of jail when they try to go shoot video for you, for us.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.743]  I wish I wouldn't have woken up at 2.15 last night and couldn't sleep.
[00:30:47.665 --> 00:30:48.846]  I'm starting to run out of gas here.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.761]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls and continue with news.
[00:30:52.941 --> 00:30:54.942]  I'm just going to hurriedly go through the stack of news in a moment.
[00:30:55.322 --> 00:30:57.143]  I wanted to thank one other group of sponsors.
[00:30:57.583 --> 00:30:59.924]  Survivalseedbank.com, wonderful folks.
[00:31:00.344 --> 00:31:06.546]  In a real crisis, having a non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[00:31:07.006 --> 00:31:11.208]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrim for example, when seeds are the highest value of any barter item.
[00:31:11.608 --> 00:31:16.630]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds, waged by the global elite, wanting to control us by controlling the food supply.
[00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:18.330]  Governments are storing seeds.
[00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.630]  The U.N.
[00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:19.291]  is storing seeds.
[00:31:19.331 --> 00:31:21.771]  Globals have every stripe of storing seeds under the Arctic Circle.
[00:31:21.811 --> 00:31:22.391]  That's admitted.
[00:31:23.892 --> 00:31:24.832]  Why do you think this is?
[00:31:24.912 --> 00:31:25.392]  You know why.
[00:31:25.472 --> 00:31:25.952]  Control.
[00:31:26.472 --> 00:31:30.133]  So this is from scientists trying to get the seeds out of the globalist's hands, into the hands of the people.
[00:31:30.513 --> 00:31:31.373]  One seed bank at a time.
[00:31:31.493 --> 00:31:32.274]  One family at a time.
[00:31:32.834 --> 00:31:34.274]  Go to survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:34.294 --> 00:31:35.894]  Get their high quality survival seed bank.
[00:31:36.555 --> 00:31:37.455]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:31:37.475 --> 00:31:37.515]  877-327-0365.
[00:31:46.368 --> 00:31:50.392]  One other sponsor I want to tell you about is DigiNet Personal Audio Video Recording Systems.
[00:31:50.412 --> 00:31:56.159]  They have sunglasses with a tiny hidden audio video camera with a little chip in it that records hours of video.
[00:31:56.699 --> 00:32:02.265]  Great to protect yourself from the police and the government and the media and the lying big brother system, fight fire with fire.
[00:32:02.626 --> 00:32:06.009]  They're running a special for the In The Fed Rally on November 22nd nationwide.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.142]  Get 10% off the DigiNet pins.
[00:32:10.162 --> 00:32:11.983]  You hit one button, it shoots video and audio.
[00:32:12.003 --> 00:32:16.326]  For the Alex Jones listeners, on their website, type in ETF09.
[00:32:16.366 --> 00:32:19.509]  That's the product code, ETF09, in the promo box.
[00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:22.491]  Or if you call, just mention InTheFed09.
[00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:23.852]  Their toll-free number is 888-344-6681.
[00:32:23.872 --> 00:32:23.912]  888-344-6681.
[00:32:23.952 --> 00:32:24.232]  DigiNet.net.
[00:32:24.293 --> 00:32:26.875]  And also support our local AM and FM affiliates.
[00:32:37.344 --> 00:32:38.564]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[00:32:38.664 --> 00:32:38.784]  Good.
[00:33:05.569 --> 00:33:13.192]  As I was traveling in here, I commute from Pennsylvania down to Maryland, down the corridor there, I-270.
[00:33:14.352 --> 00:33:27.077]  And I've been traveling this for probably 20-something years, but I've noticed over the years, especially just this past year since Obama got in, they've been doing all these bridge work and road work.
[00:33:27.957 --> 00:33:31.018]  Yeah, that's part of the economic stimulus package.
[00:33:31.078 --> 00:33:33.659]  It's a payoff to the local constabulary, but it was also needed.
[00:33:34.574 --> 00:33:40.699]  Yeah, well... For every $30 given to the banks, $1 was given to infrastructure, but at least something happened.
[00:33:40.739 --> 00:33:43.482]  At least a blind hog does find an acorn occasionally.
[00:33:44.242 --> 00:33:45.823]  This sign jumped out at me this morning.
[00:33:45.864 --> 00:33:47.105]  I've seen these things going in.
[00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:48.966]  They're near a truckway station.
[00:33:49.607 --> 00:33:52.769]  And it always tells you, look for terrorists, look for an old lady who's lost?
[00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.830]  Right.
[00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:56.212]  It says, electronic screening site.
[00:33:57.193 --> 00:34:00.716]  They put these things up over the road, and I thought they were cameras at first.
[00:34:01.547 --> 00:34:06.851]  But I believe they're more of a RFID type reader.
[00:34:06.871 --> 00:34:14.617]  Yeah, no, they're reading trucks, GPS, and their barcode, transponders, transceivers.
[00:34:14.737 --> 00:34:17.859]  They're also, different systems are reading your license plate.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.120]  Right.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:23.943]  But it seems like the improvements that they're doing on the highway, it's more like a cattle chute.
[00:34:25.925 --> 00:34:26.225]  There is no...
[00:34:29.718 --> 00:34:31.900]  Lockdown could become lockdown very easily.
[00:34:32.841 --> 00:34:39.565]  All over the country they're putting cable barriers up on I-37, going to Corpus Christi, everywhere.
[00:34:39.605 --> 00:34:40.926]  And they admit it's to control us.
[00:34:41.006 --> 00:34:41.166]  No.
[00:34:41.787 --> 00:34:46.810]  What would a criminal group do that seized the banking system and the government and was robbing everyone?
[00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:49.232]  They would put in a police state to protect themselves.
[00:34:49.272 --> 00:34:50.172]  That's all this is.
[00:34:51.073 --> 00:34:51.293]  Right.
[00:34:51.834 --> 00:34:52.354]  Exactly.
[00:34:53.115 --> 00:34:53.575]  Exactly.
[00:34:53.635 --> 00:34:58.317]  And you're nailing it right on the head with the control grid.
[00:34:58.337 --> 00:34:59.858]  That's just part of it.
[00:34:59.918 --> 00:35:10.402]  So that's what prompted my call, but the pastor was on a while ago talking to you, and I was looking, right when he got on there, I was looking at the same verse, Ezekiel 33, 6.
[00:35:10.862 --> 00:35:13.223]  It says about you being the watchman.
[00:35:13.243 --> 00:35:14.684]  You know, I consider you a watchman.
[00:35:15.325 --> 00:35:29.417]  But if the watchman sees the sword come and blown off the trumpet, and the people will be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity, but the blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
[00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:35.623]  I believe your hands are clean, Alex, you know, and I wholeheartedly support what you're doing.
[00:35:37.304 --> 00:35:39.626]  Just keep it up.
[00:35:40.146 --> 00:35:40.987]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:35:41.187 --> 00:35:41.728]  God bless you.
[00:35:43.413 --> 00:35:47.775]  Yeah, I didn't know what I was getting into 16 years ago, 14 years ago on air.
[00:35:47.795 --> 00:35:52.758]  I mean, I knew there were big banks and they were corrupt and there was a new world order, but it was still off in the distance.
[00:35:52.838 --> 00:35:57.781]  And, you know, I did original research and read a lot of other people's good original research.
[00:35:58.941 --> 00:36:04.624]  But then in the late 90s, it started coming out in mainstream news that the UN runs giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:36:04.664 --> 00:36:05.525]  And I was like, what?
[00:36:06.889 --> 00:36:14.591]  And then I saw congressional hearings in 2002 where they admitted DynCorp does this and they don't get in trouble and Rumsfeld said they're allowed to and laughed about it.
[00:36:16.352 --> 00:36:18.053]  It's like they're crushing us with evil.
[00:36:18.093 --> 00:36:18.973]  They're flaunting it.
[00:36:19.293 --> 00:36:26.115]  Those of us in the know, they're terrorizing us and everybody else, they're just searing their conscience where we're trained to put up with anything.
[00:36:27.856 --> 00:36:29.476]  And then all the other stuff they do.
[00:36:30.076 --> 00:36:33.157]  And the globalists, you talk to them, you're like, well, there is population reduction going on.
[00:36:33.197 --> 00:36:34.638]  They go, well, what are you going to do for the Earth?
[00:36:38.249 --> 00:36:49.356]  And it's creepy to know they're on my tail and coming at me from every angle.
[00:36:52.218 --> 00:36:54.699]  But it's really creepy to know I can be taken out of the game.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.160]  That's all.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.001]  I want to stay in the game.
[00:36:58.396 --> 00:36:59.277]  I want to get better.
[00:37:00.158 --> 00:37:02.240]  I want to be a better radio host.
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.261]  I want to tell the truth.
[00:37:03.921 --> 00:37:05.042]  I want to be more accurate.
[00:37:05.083 --> 00:37:07.685]  I want to make sure I cover all the angles for people.
[00:37:07.745 --> 00:37:09.487]  I want to be a good father.
[00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:10.608]  I want to be a good husband.
[00:37:10.668 --> 00:37:13.010]  I want to be good to my crew.
[00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:17.394]  I want to, at the same time, enjoy life and be able to see things.
[00:37:17.454 --> 00:37:19.877]  I have a wanderlust, but I can't enjoy that.
[00:37:22.499 --> 00:37:23.359]  I'm not complaining.
[00:37:23.379 --> 00:37:26.822]  It's just we've all been robbed of our innocence.
[00:37:27.463 --> 00:37:28.804]  We've been robbed of our time.
[00:37:28.844 --> 00:37:30.225]  We've been robbed of our future.
[00:37:31.506 --> 00:37:33.408]  And I don't even hate my enemy anymore.
[00:37:34.068 --> 00:37:37.951]  I realize that 99% of the people carrying out this new world order are just ignorant.
[00:37:38.652 --> 00:37:39.773]  They're under mind control.
[00:37:39.793 --> 00:37:40.734]  There's no other word for it.
[00:37:41.074 --> 00:37:41.835]  They're under a spell.
[00:37:43.351 --> 00:37:45.052]  And I'm more horrified for them.
[00:37:45.072 --> 00:37:48.835]  I never understood reading the Bible where Jesus is saying, forgive them, Father.
[00:37:48.855 --> 00:37:49.876]  They know not what they do.
[00:37:49.936 --> 00:37:54.219]  And other apostles after him actually feeling sorry for those that were persecuting them.
[00:37:54.479 --> 00:37:58.502]  But they were understanding these people are given over to pure evil.
[00:37:58.522 --> 00:37:59.222]  They're destroyed.
[00:37:59.262 --> 00:38:00.303]  They're losing their soul.
[00:38:00.343 --> 00:38:01.464]  They're losing their humanity.
[00:38:03.125 --> 00:38:06.347]  And I don't want to hate the BATF for bombing Oklahoma City.
[00:38:07.028 --> 00:38:11.171]  I don't want to hate all these people.
[00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:19.060]  Especially their dumb minions that don't know what they're part of, or some young power-tripping cop who's brainwashed.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.081]  I just... I wish they could be good.
[00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:24.741]  I wish they could know what I know.
[00:38:25.342 --> 00:38:27.482]  I wish I could take them to the places I've been.
[00:38:27.502 --> 00:38:30.543]  I wish they could see with my eyes what I've seen.
[00:38:31.303 --> 00:38:32.944]  And I know they've seen a lot of things I haven't seen.
[00:38:39.312 --> 00:38:46.354]  You know, in the past, I've hated people that have attacked me in government and in media and in my own genre, as they call it.
[00:38:46.494 --> 00:38:50.975]  And now I've lost that with greater discernment.
[00:38:52.576 --> 00:38:55.057]  And I'm more focused.
[00:38:55.197 --> 00:38:56.037]  I'm more peaceful.
[00:38:56.837 --> 00:38:59.718]  But in that quietness, I have such greater understanding.
[00:39:01.118 --> 00:39:03.299]  And in a way, I miss the flesh.
[00:39:03.499 --> 00:39:04.899]  And I still have a lot of flesh in me.
[00:39:04.939 --> 00:39:06.340]  I still have a lot of worldliness in me.
[00:39:07.472 --> 00:39:09.914]  But it's much weaker than it was a long time ago.
[00:39:12.396 --> 00:39:12.957]  And I almost...
[00:39:14.275 --> 00:39:17.797]  Miss hating my enemies and miss that because it was a distraction.
[00:39:17.837 --> 00:39:28.023]  It was a worldly distraction, kind of a tunnel vision to distract me from the larger mission I'm on so that I wouldn't have to just constantly sit here with the information just seething through me.
[00:39:28.804 --> 00:39:31.465]  And I mean, I don't even want to, most days I don't cover the news.
[00:39:31.505 --> 00:39:35.028]  I do all the research and don't even cover most of it because I don't want to cover this.
[00:39:35.908 --> 00:39:40.731]  I don't want to focus and have the thoughts again I had earlier and the understanding and all the info.
[00:39:41.251 --> 00:39:42.112]  I mean, I'm like, ah,
[00:39:44.295 --> 00:39:57.568]  I guess I'm kind of like a cop or something that is a detective and has done a couple hundred murder investigations and at a certain point, I don't want to see dead families and blood and death and torture chambers and that's what I see, that's what I do!
[00:39:57.588 --> 00:40:05.977]  And I have to watch the murderers in fancy $5,000 suits traipsing around, destroying my country, destroying our whole future?
[00:40:12.492 --> 00:40:15.194]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:40:15.454 --> 00:40:16.335]  And I can't stop.
[00:40:16.435 --> 00:40:17.156]  I can't give up.
[00:40:18.317 --> 00:40:21.519]  Even if I was a coward and wanted to give up, it's not in me.
[00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:22.280]  I can't do it.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.263]  And if I give up, they'll come after me even more.
[00:40:26.343 --> 00:40:28.985]  I have to continue.
[00:40:29.746 --> 00:40:30.967]  We all have to continue.
[00:40:30.987 --> 00:40:32.508]  We're not getting out of this, folks.
[00:40:33.008 --> 00:40:33.949]  We're going through it.
[00:40:33.989 --> 00:40:34.490]  You understand?
[00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:35.791]  You're not backing out of this.
[00:40:36.991 --> 00:40:39.913]  We passed the point of no return into world government a long time ago.
[00:40:40.213 --> 00:40:40.834]  And that's the thing.
[00:40:40.894 --> 00:40:43.756]  I realize a lot of you don't know what you're in.
[00:40:43.916 --> 00:40:45.698]  I'm not talking about those of you that have been fighting this.
[00:40:45.758 --> 00:40:46.438]  You're in it too.
[00:40:46.718 --> 00:40:47.579]  But at least you know.
[00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:52.463]  It's like walking around a field at night with big 50-foot pits in it with spikes in the bottom.
[00:40:53.603 --> 00:40:55.385]  And I'm a guy saying, you better have a flashlight.
[00:40:55.425 --> 00:40:56.966]  You better be careful out in that field, man.
[00:40:57.006 --> 00:40:58.007]  There's some bad stuff.
[00:40:58.267 --> 00:40:59.047]  Look at history.
[00:41:00.428 --> 00:41:01.769]  I've fallen into those pits.
[00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:03.831]  I've seen a lot of other people fall into those pits.
[00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:05.012]  You better listen to me.
[00:41:05.072 --> 00:41:05.913]  This isn't a game.
[00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.631]  And I watch people laugh at me and go stumble off the cliff.
[00:41:10.212 --> 00:41:12.193]  And I go, did you just see him fall into that pit?
[00:41:17.476 --> 00:41:23.040]  And I don't want the FBI and the military and the police and the bureaucrats and the corporate people
[00:41:24.025 --> 00:41:25.145]  To go along with this.
[00:41:25.345 --> 00:41:26.846]  I don't want to see them lost.
[00:41:26.986 --> 00:41:28.527]  I don't want to see them serve it.
[00:41:28.927 --> 00:41:31.648]  They think a lot of them at a primitive level, they're tough guys.
[00:41:31.668 --> 00:41:33.088]  That's how the world really works.
[00:41:33.148 --> 00:41:35.129]  And you're just weak and can't understand it.
[00:41:35.169 --> 00:41:41.191]  We're doing, you know, we're making the tough decisions and you just can't get, you know, your mind wrapped around that.
[00:41:41.251 --> 00:41:44.672]  And, you know, yeah, we're evil, but we're the evil that's protecting you.
[00:41:45.012 --> 00:41:47.813]  You know, we've got to be evil to defeat the real evil.
[00:41:47.853 --> 00:41:50.494]  And, you know, that's the system that they, the lie.
[00:41:51.872 --> 00:41:59.298]  The mindset that's sold by them, that these merchants of death and merchants of lies and fraud and deceit push.
[00:42:05.683 --> 00:42:11.268]  And I was never an evil person, but I could go there in my mind when I was young.
[00:42:12.569 --> 00:42:14.650]  I could see the beauty of evil.
[00:42:15.311 --> 00:42:21.096]  On the surface it can look sexy and powerful, but then I really
[00:42:22.853 --> 00:42:28.796]  Stuck my head into it and went whoa and pulled back and it strengthened my humanity by pulling out of it.
[00:42:30.436 --> 00:42:40.381]  And there's those of you out there that think you're winning and think you have this power and think that you're out there just slaughtering and enslaving and abusing and you don't think of us as human.
[00:42:41.001 --> 00:42:46.824]  There are people above you in levels far more wicked than you can imagine and I have
[00:42:48.718 --> 00:42:49.779]  Learned their mind.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.782]  I have seen through their eyes.
[00:42:52.102 --> 00:42:53.804]  And let me tell you something.
[00:42:53.824 --> 00:42:57.769]  You better turn around right now and realize there is no turning around.
[00:42:57.789 --> 00:42:58.690]  We gotta go through this.

[00:44:00.828 --> 00:44:04.511]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:07.833]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:10.225 --> 00:44:12.887]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:12.907 --> 00:44:19.111]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:19.291 --> 00:44:24.814]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:24.834 --> 00:44:34.460]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.682]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:36.922 --> 00:44:38.243]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:38.503 --> 00:44:40.785]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:40.965 --> 00:44:42.826]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:43.107 --> 00:44:47.930]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:45:19.002 --> 00:45:19.202]  Yes, it is.

[00:45:52.852 --> 00:45:54.892]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man.
[00:45:54.912 --> 00:45:55.612]  To be the sad man.
[00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:56.312]  Behind blue eyes,
[00:46:15.047 --> 00:46:27.471]  No one knows what it's like to be hated, to be fated, to telling only lies.
[00:46:29.232 --> 00:46:41.976]  But my dreams, they aren't as empty as my conscience seems to be.
[00:46:58.587 --> 00:47:00.468]  Jerry in Arkansas, you're on the air.
[00:47:00.528 --> 00:47:01.289]  Thanks for holding.
[00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.749]  Welcome.
[00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:03.250]  Hey Alex.
[00:47:03.851 --> 00:47:04.171]  Hey buddy.
[00:47:05.011 --> 00:47:06.832]  It's nice to speak to you again.
[00:47:06.873 --> 00:47:11.916]  I want to commend you on being one of the few last credible sources of information out there.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:23.183]  I called to touch on the point that you said earlier about how the Bible was being changed and how this is really and truly a spiritual battle, although most of us only see the secular side.
[00:47:24.763 --> 00:47:33.105]  And I wanted to read something to the listeners out there real quick who think that Jesus was always a pacifist and believed in letting evil trample over him.
[00:47:34.766 --> 00:47:42.368]  My Lord said this, But now he that hath the purse, let him take it.
[00:47:42.924 --> 00:47:50.166]  And likewise his script, and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.
[00:47:51.826 --> 00:47:59.448]  He said that these things were going to be necessary for the transgressions that were coming concerning him at the end of time.
[00:48:01.528 --> 00:48:09.610]  We are in a very deep spiritual battle with these people who you talk about every day, who are the sons of Satan.
[00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:12.311]  And many of us are going to lose
[00:48:13.146 --> 00:48:20.632]  Our bodies in this battle, and our lives in this battle, that you won't lose your soul.
[00:48:20.812 --> 00:48:28.238]  And you have to understand that we are spiritual beings caught in a paradox of space and time.
[00:48:28.518 --> 00:48:31.220]  And for anybody that doesn't know that, they have no discernment.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.042]  We're on a planet in deep space.
[00:48:34.722 --> 00:48:41.848]  I've got the top CERN scientists in mainstream news saying they're about to open an interdimensional gate.
[00:48:44.164 --> 00:48:55.214]  The beings who run this world that serve their god, Satan, they have illuminated knowledge that they have not shared with the rest of humanity.
[00:48:55.234 --> 00:48:56.996]  That's the big lie!
[00:48:57.036 --> 00:48:59.919]  They know if the public knew the truth, they'd instantly repent!
[00:49:00.868 --> 00:49:01.529]  Absolutely.
[00:49:01.969 --> 00:49:02.469]  They know!
[00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:04.330]  That's the thing about the truly evil ones.
[00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:05.511]  They know all this.
[00:49:06.111 --> 00:49:07.272]  Kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:49:07.812 --> 00:49:09.273]  What does eco-science say?
[00:49:09.593 --> 00:49:10.194]  Kill us!
[00:49:10.674 --> 00:49:14.577]  Their religion was killing us 3,000 years ago, and it is today.
[00:49:15.517 --> 00:49:16.918]  You're absolutely right.
[00:49:17.158 --> 00:49:20.160]  And we are so close to the end times.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:29.746]  And the great prophet Daniel said that at the end times, Babylon, which is this system we live under, not the place over there in Persia that we now call Iraq,
[00:49:30.566 --> 00:49:35.029]  Babylon, which is the system, would speak with the voice of the lion.
[00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:36.350]  You can look this up yourself.
[00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:40.693]  Now, what that means is the lion was a symbology for England.
[00:49:40.793 --> 00:49:44.296]  So, in the end times, the world is going to speak English.
[00:49:44.356 --> 00:49:53.983]  The other night, on CBS News, they were playing a little story about the beauty contest in South America, which, of course, I took some interest in.
[00:49:54.003 --> 00:49:58.026]  But these girls spoke and looked
[00:49:58.979 --> 00:50:05.085]  Just as English and American, and you could not even pick up an accent in their voice.
[00:50:05.125 --> 00:50:07.247]  They're teaching the children in the middle of Africa.
[00:50:07.267 --> 00:50:10.950]  It is the world, it is the global imperial language.
[00:50:11.851 --> 00:50:21.600]  Absolutely, because they're preparing us for this new Babylon, this new one world system, one world order in which they bring the chaos and then they bring the solution.
[00:50:22.711 --> 00:50:25.732]  And that is the mission statement of the 33rd level.
[00:50:25.812 --> 00:50:26.332]  You know that.
[00:50:26.372 --> 00:50:33.075]  You tell people that every day, Alex, of the nations who are one of the inner, inner sectors.
[00:50:33.135 --> 00:50:35.195]  Jerry, great points, but we're out of time.
[00:50:35.495 --> 00:50:37.556]  Back with the final hour in 70 seconds.
[00:50:37.576 --> 00:50:39.597]  Warrior Calls, Webster Tarpon.
[00:50:40.517 --> 00:50:41.917]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:41.937 --> 00:50:44.418]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:52.853]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:50:53.173 --> 00:50:57.236]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:50:57.517 --> 00:51:02.921]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:03.261 --> 00:51:03.722]  It's true.
[00:51:04.002 --> 00:51:08.566]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:08.866 --> 00:51:09.406]  Number 3.
[00:51:09.686 --> 00:51:12.967]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:13.268 --> 00:51:17.009]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:17.189 --> 00:51:17.749]  Number 4.
[00:51:17.989 --> 00:51:20.350]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:24.131]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:24.432 --> 00:51:24.632]  Number 5.
[00:51:25.212 --> 00:51:29.133]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:29.353 --> 00:51:34.115]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:51:34.415 --> 00:51:38.456]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:38.576 --> 00:51:40.157]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:40.377 --> 00:51:42.457]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:51:42.617 --> 00:51:44.978]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:52:04.201 --> 00:52:06.483]  We are already into hour number four.
[00:52:06.503 --> 00:52:08.365]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls.
[00:52:08.385 --> 00:52:10.687]  The Hebster Tarpley will be with us about 30 minutes.
[00:52:12.768 --> 00:52:14.109]  By the way, I forgot to print it.
[00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:17.492]  Can you print me the headline?
[00:52:17.512 --> 00:52:19.134]  I just want to have the article they wrote.
[00:52:19.234 --> 00:52:19.934]  It's detailed.
[00:52:19.994 --> 00:52:20.955]  Huge bibliography.
[00:52:22.036 --> 00:52:24.838]  Was Fort Hood shooter Patsy Indrill?
[00:52:27.381 --> 00:52:28.762]  That's close to the headline.
[00:52:30.779 --> 00:52:31.999]  Was Fort Hood Patsy?
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.360]  Was Fort Hood Shooter a Patsy and Brill?
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:35.961]  I need that for Webster coming up.
[00:52:36.461 --> 00:52:38.182]  Then I'm going to play a clip from the Watchmen.
[00:52:38.202 --> 00:52:39.522]  I'll just talk about Watchmen today.
[00:52:40.443 --> 00:52:41.763]  The New World Order has its Watchmen.
[00:52:42.343 --> 00:52:44.244]  This is deep Illuminati teaching.
[00:52:44.264 --> 00:52:47.345]  We're going to play this on air and expose these bastards for what they are.
[00:52:48.766 --> 00:52:51.727]  Let's go ahead and go back to the phone calls.
[00:52:52.767 --> 00:52:54.408]  Let's talk to Gabe in New York.
[00:52:54.968 --> 00:52:56.489]  Gabe in New York, you're on the air.
[00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:57.169]  Thank you for holding.
[00:52:58.325 --> 00:53:00.726]  Hi Alex Jones, Gabriel.
[00:53:01.247 --> 00:53:03.888]  I sent you those photos on the call from last week.
[00:53:03.928 --> 00:53:10.152]  I sent those photos to Aaron at InfoWars with the troops with the .30 caliber machine guns on Jones Beach.
[00:53:10.212 --> 00:53:12.133]  They're basically walking around the boardwalk.
[00:53:12.153 --> 00:53:13.854]  The photos are very self-explanatory.
[00:53:13.914 --> 00:53:16.756]  What is the title of your article and what address did you send it to?
[00:53:16.776 --> 00:53:18.777]  I want to pull them and get them to curtain him.
[00:53:18.978 --> 00:53:21.999]  I sent it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[00:53:22.059 --> 00:53:22.880]  And what's the title?
[00:53:24.259 --> 00:53:29.580]  Um, it's, I think, uh, Jones Beach, um, military .30 caliber machine gun.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.860]  Okay, guys, can I have a pen?
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.321]  My pen's just, oh, here's one that's on the floor.
[00:53:35.061 --> 00:53:37.701]  Okay, so the title's Jones Beach .30 caliber.
[00:53:37.721 --> 00:53:40.982]  Yeah, it talks about, it's pretty self-explained in the photos.
[00:53:41.102 --> 00:53:45.583]  I also had a couple other points I wanted to get across that I think are important.
[00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:47.963]  Um, here's what the New World Order is.
[00:53:48.183 --> 00:53:52.064]  It's, if you understand the system, people, the new listeners on the show,
[00:53:52.811 --> 00:53:57.073]  It's the combination of risk, monopoly, and chess.
[00:53:57.113 --> 00:54:01.654]  You combine those three principles, those three games, and you understand what the system is.
[00:54:01.694 --> 00:54:08.157]  The individuals, however, to understand them, you have to understand history, patterns, and psychology.
[00:54:08.217 --> 00:54:09.777]  And what is their psychology?
[00:54:10.238 --> 00:54:21.902]  Their psychology is being sociopaths, highly paranoid psychopaths, addictive personalities, obsessive-compulsive, hyper-competitive, calculated,
[00:54:29.269 --> 00:54:36.235]  They use criminal guilds and secret criminal guilds of compromised people and pedophiles are one.
[00:54:36.755 --> 00:54:39.878]  That's always been that way with Satanists and people throughout history.
[00:54:40.258 --> 00:54:45.983]  Even before they called it Satanism, it was all about sacrificing children because the state and the priest class
[00:54:46.744 --> 00:54:48.705]  Demands our most pure and innocent.
[00:54:49.125 --> 00:54:50.586]  It's a war against innocence.
[00:54:50.686 --> 00:54:54.228]  But yes, the pedophile guilds are very near the top of the pyramid.
[00:54:54.888 --> 00:54:55.628]  That's what they believe.
[00:54:55.648 --> 00:54:59.450]  They also believe in this idea called, if I can't have it, no one can.
[00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:01.311]  In other words, they'll destroy the world.
[00:55:01.771 --> 00:55:04.192]  All of their philosophy, I have that in game.
[00:55:04.353 --> 00:55:09.755]  All these top transhumanists say, if we can't control the world, we will destroy it.
[00:55:09.855 --> 00:55:10.636]  Lennon wrote that.
[00:55:11.156 --> 00:55:13.457]  You really know your stuff, Gabe.
[00:55:13.919 --> 00:55:14.420]  Here's the thing.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.020]  Here's their game.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.242]  You want to understand their game?
[00:55:16.282 --> 00:55:20.046]  Their game is an aristocratic game where people are mere playthings.
[00:55:20.507 --> 00:55:23.690]  Remember the American Revolutionary War with the battlefields?
[00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:28.336]  That looked like a big board game, how the troops would be lined up shooting each other.
[00:55:28.846 --> 00:55:29.806]  And why did they do that?
[00:55:29.866 --> 00:55:32.047]  Because they wanted to be gentlemanly-like.
[00:55:32.087 --> 00:55:34.649]  And we have to remember what their ideas come from.
[00:55:34.689 --> 00:55:36.269]  They come from British royalties.
[00:55:36.329 --> 00:55:44.493]  Remember David Gergen, White House advisor to four administrations, got in my face and said, you sneaking into Bohemian Grove wasn't very gentlemanly!
[00:55:45.202 --> 00:55:46.723]  My friend loved that clip.
[00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:48.924]  He said that was the best thing he ever saw in his life.
[00:55:49.104 --> 00:55:53.485]  And as far as these people are going, you gotta remember what the elite are like.
[00:55:53.505 --> 00:55:56.667]  They're basically of British royalty and they believe in being very polite.
[00:55:56.687 --> 00:56:00.528]  They're basically a bunch of decadent, sickening, hyper-intelligent control freaks.
[00:56:01.249 --> 00:56:03.670]  And I don't like what they're doing to me and my family and other people.
[00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:07.151]  And I don't like them going after innocent people and I'm sick of their garbage.
[00:56:07.791 --> 00:56:10.212]  That's why they're openly honest about what they're doing.
[00:56:10.232 --> 00:56:14.194]  They want us to know what they're doing so they can justify everything they're doing.
[00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:26.538]  And then they say, they say, exactly, we admit what we're doing, but then we lie about it, because if you're profane and deserve to be destroyed, then we admit it to you, but then deny it.
[00:56:26.818 --> 00:56:29.960]  It's a mind game to say, well, we told you we're going to do this.
[00:56:30.461 --> 00:56:31.982]  Now we're going to launch our PSYOP.
[00:56:32.542 --> 00:56:33.543]  Now we're going to lie to you.
[00:56:33.603 --> 00:56:41.008]  You're absolutely, listen, you should start calling in a few times a week to the new caller line, 512-646-7000.
[00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:52.060]  4444.
[00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:52.060]  You're so good, Gabe, and we might play a minute clip of you ranting about something on the news every day, because you absolutely are on target.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:55.765]  You're a fellow after my own mind, and we really appreciate you.
[00:56:55.785 --> 00:56:56.986]  That's a good caller right there.
[00:56:57.006 --> 00:56:57.447]  Stay with us.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:04.563]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[00:57:58.325 --> 00:58:05.809]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:58:06.089 --> 00:58:11.332]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.
[00:58:12.152 --> 00:58:14.834]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:58:15.114 --> 00:58:21.037]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.

[00:58:31.081 --> 00:58:32.901]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:58:33.161 --> 00:58:34.562]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:58:34.902 --> 00:58:37.162]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:58:37.442 --> 00:58:41.803]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:58:42.163 --> 00:58:45.544]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:58:45.864 --> 00:58:48.505]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:48.985 --> 00:58:50.425]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:50.885 --> 00:58:53.006]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:59.255 --> 00:59:02.879]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:59:02.899 --> 00:59:06.263]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:59:06.503 --> 00:59:11.289]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:11.309 --> 00:59:17.556]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:17.716 --> 00:59:19.939]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:20.459 --> 00:59:20.759]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:20.779 --> 00:59:21.200]  Bernanke?
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.060]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.221]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:23.241 --> 00:59:25.483]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:39.372 --> 00:59:41.214]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:41.234 --> 00:59:46.218]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:59:46.558 --> 00:59:56.487]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:00.791 --> 01:00:06.395]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.594 --> 01:00:20.777]  Well, Webster Griffin Tarpley is an amazing author.
[01:00:21.177 --> 01:00:25.520]  He is a big part of Fall of the Republic, my newest film, and the Obama deception.
[01:00:26.021 --> 01:00:31.284]  He is a doctor of history, a doctor of economics, and
[01:00:33.564 --> 01:00:36.826]  We always really respect his analysis and breakdown.
[01:00:37.526 --> 01:00:41.308]  He's an invaluable resource for all of us that want to know the truth and cut through the fog.
[01:00:41.828 --> 01:00:44.890]  In fact, he's had one of the best-selling 9-11 books.
[01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:51.313]  We actually sell it at InfoWars.com, only the best what we offer at InfoWars.com on the online video bookstore.
[01:00:51.333 --> 01:00:53.034]  9-11 Synthetic Terror.
[01:00:54.415 --> 01:00:58.277]  How 9-11 was manufactured with Patsy's, Dube's, Moles.
[01:00:59.432 --> 01:01:07.820]  And when you understand the methodology and pattern of why they use drills, why they use moles, why they use Patsy's, this is a lot of this has been declassified.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.381]  You can understand it now.
[01:01:09.682 --> 01:01:20.692]  We're two weeks plus into the or almost two weeks into the murders at Fort Hood, Texas.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:27.262]  Major Hassan of Fort Hood, a Patsy and a Drill Gone Live question mark, is a detailed article.
[01:01:27.302 --> 01:01:31.784]  We appreciate Webster sending it to us for publishing at Infowars.com.
[01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:34.245]  It is a huge article.
[01:01:36.606 --> 01:01:39.908]  More than, what is it, 18, 19 pages?
[01:01:40.628 --> 01:01:43.689]  A huge bibliography, all mainstream news sources.
[01:01:44.469 --> 01:01:50.132]  So with us in this segment, the next, and part of the segment after that, then I'm doing my breakdown of the Watchmen.
[01:01:51.678 --> 01:01:55.621]  Is Webster Griffin Tarpley specifically on this subject?
[01:01:56.022 --> 01:01:57.463]  Webster, it's great to have you on.
[01:01:57.503 --> 01:01:59.144]  Thanks for coming on on short notice.
[01:01:59.605 --> 01:02:01.526]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you for the kind words.
[01:02:02.047 --> 01:02:03.208]  Well, the truth is the truth.
[01:02:03.248 --> 01:02:04.569]  Veritas must be trumpeted.
[01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:06.690]  Webster, I'm going to try to sit back.
[01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:07.951]  We don't have a lot of time with you today.
[01:02:08.872 --> 01:02:09.813]  Go through your article.
[01:02:09.913 --> 01:02:10.634]  Break it down.
[01:02:11.114 --> 01:02:12.135]  Maybe first explain.
[01:02:12.275 --> 01:02:18.660]  Well, you know how to explain it, but I would imagine it'd be good if you explained how Patsy's dupes drills are used over and over again.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.162]  We see the same fingerprints.
[01:02:21.007 --> 01:02:21.867]  Thank you Alex.
[01:02:21.887 --> 01:02:27.949]  You've already said the most important premise, I guess, which is there's a method to these things.
[01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:30.449]  And once you know the method, you can recognize them.
[01:02:44.179 --> 01:02:45.580]  I think relatively easily.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:54.985]  False flag terrorism or these kinds of provocations that are dished up by intelligence agencies involve the use of, first of all, the Patsy.
[01:02:55.026 --> 01:03:02.090]  That would be somebody like Lee Harvey Oswald or Mohammed Atta or Cho, the shooter there at Virginia Tech.
[01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:03.070]  Jim McVeigh.
[01:03:03.831 --> 01:03:07.233]  McVeigh, the Bong, Sirhan Sirhan, James Earl Ray.
[01:03:07.613 --> 01:03:08.494]  These are the Patsy's.
[01:03:08.514 --> 01:03:10.875]  These are the fall guys and they're going to be demonized.
[01:03:11.644 --> 01:03:13.405]  They're always screwed up ding-dongs.
[01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:33.875]  But always getting noticed, but always getting away with it.
[01:03:34.235 --> 01:03:38.317]  Doing egregious, crazy things, but never having sanctuary.
[01:03:38.377 --> 01:03:39.378]  And we have that here.
[01:03:39.478 --> 01:03:45.321]  He's saying all these horrible things, worshipping suicide bombers, FBI, CIA.
[01:03:45.361 --> 01:03:46.962]  He tried to contact Al Qaeda.
[01:03:47.182 --> 01:03:48.783]  He didn't know he was contacting the CIA.
[01:03:50.618 --> 01:03:54.521]  The soldier of Allah, he wants to get people put on trial for war crimes.
[01:03:54.881 --> 01:03:55.862]  But you have to look deeper.
[01:03:56.442 --> 01:03:57.203]  The mole, right?
[01:03:57.303 --> 01:03:59.984]  Inside the government, there's a private network.
[01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:01.245]  It's not a government network.
[01:04:01.285 --> 01:04:02.746]  I call it a Wall Street network.
[01:04:03.147 --> 01:04:04.307]  Call it a rogue network.
[01:04:04.387 --> 01:04:07.470]  It's an Anglo-American intelligence network.
[01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:10.111]  And this has its own separate agenda.
[01:04:10.171 --> 01:04:13.033]  And they try to make sure that the Patsy's don't get rounded up.
[01:04:13.514 --> 01:04:19.698]  Until the event occurs, the mole wants to make sure that the Patsy is left free, because otherwise you can't blame him.
[01:04:19.999 --> 01:04:29.477]  So that's evidence one that as usual, like 9-11, like McVeigh, like Sirhan Sirhan, like Lee Harvey Oswald, they always protect the minion.
[01:04:30.285 --> 01:04:31.526]  Until it happens.
[01:04:31.586 --> 01:04:36.188]  And then, of course, they round them up right away, because then they've got to come up with a scapegoat.
[01:04:36.508 --> 01:04:50.775]  And then, of course, we have the technicians, the people that you don't see who actually have the physical, technical capability of bringing about the events, the people who wired the buildings for controlled demolition or who really did the shooting there in Dealey Plaza in Dallas.
[01:04:52.376 --> 01:04:53.017]  Way back when.
[01:04:53.077 --> 01:04:55.399]  So you've got to look at it from this point of view.
[01:04:55.499 --> 01:04:57.861]  And the other thing that you've said, extremely important, the drills.
[01:04:58.341 --> 01:04:59.482]  Always look for drills.
[01:04:59.722 --> 01:05:11.352]  Anybody talking about a drill, a drill going on at the same time, a drill that looks sort of like what happened, that can indicate that a drill has gone live, been taken live, or been flipped live.
[01:05:11.392 --> 01:05:13.074]  So that's essentially it.
[01:05:13.114 --> 01:05:16.517]  And of course, the brainwashing role of the controlled Wall Street media.
[01:05:17.077 --> 01:05:18.038]  Always an important thing.
[01:05:18.058 --> 01:05:23.104]  So I start with this basically saying, look, don't focus immediately on Major Hassan.
[01:05:23.585 --> 01:05:33.276]  Focus on the fact that we have multiple eyewitnesses at Ford Hood who give interviews to ABC and CBS and the Miami Herald and the Austin TV.
[01:05:33.776 --> 01:05:37.461]  And they all say, we thought we were in a drill, a drill, a drill, a drill.
[01:05:38.121 --> 01:05:48.231]  Now, that's just a subjective impression, but it means that these are experienced combat soldiers, many of them, and they've been through this before, that the military is always doing drills, right?
[01:05:48.251 --> 01:05:49.993]  They do the red team and the blue team.
[01:05:50.794 --> 01:05:56.039]  They drill everything that they would normally do in combat operations or whatever it is.
[01:05:56.439 --> 01:06:02.165]  And in this case, you want to know why Hassan might have gone to this event with a gun,
[01:06:02.865 --> 01:06:04.266]  He may have known what he was doing.
[01:06:04.346 --> 01:06:06.007]  He may have gone with criminal intent.
[01:06:06.407 --> 01:06:12.310]  But then again, he may have been just a psychotic Patsy Doop who walked into what he thought was a drill.
[01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:14.752]  You can look at the 9-11 hijackers.
[01:06:15.212 --> 01:06:18.714]  Most of them thought they were going to be actors in a drill.
[01:06:19.214 --> 01:06:21.936]  And they were in a drill until the drill went live.
[01:06:21.996 --> 01:06:23.476]  And that's been confirmed.
[01:06:23.576 --> 01:06:24.937]  Confirmed they were trained at U.S.
[01:06:24.997 --> 01:06:25.397]  bases.
[01:06:25.778 --> 01:06:27.098]  That's admitted, folks.
[01:06:28.632 --> 01:06:28.972]  Go ahead.
[01:06:29.313 --> 01:06:36.439]  And then, of course, we've got this 25-plus drills operations that were completed just before 9-11.
[01:06:36.619 --> 01:06:42.725]  Ongoing, the morning of 9-11 is the majority of them, or in the advanced stages of planning.
[01:06:42.785 --> 01:06:46.868]  So, the other thing, then, is to look for these strange anomalies and contradictions.
[01:06:46.928 --> 01:06:53.895]  For example, the news reports during the entire afternoon of this Fort Hood tragedy, which is, of course, a tragic event,
[01:06:55.056 --> 01:07:00.799]  We were told there were three shooters, that there was one killed and there were two others in custody.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.742]  And this is the kind of stuff that comes out at the beginning, right?
[01:07:04.782 --> 01:07:14.608]  You've always got to go and get screenshots of what happens very early on, because after a while this stuff gets expunged and people forget about it, because the media is focusing on Hassan.
[01:07:14.889 --> 01:07:17.470]  But we were told that there were two other shooters.
[01:07:18.031 --> 01:07:18.631]  Where are they?
[01:07:18.931 --> 01:07:22.814]  We were told that there were two shooting incidents, one at this readiness center.
[01:07:23.544 --> 01:07:25.385]  And we're told that he was killed for six hours.
[01:07:25.445 --> 01:07:25.725]  Right.
[01:07:40.951 --> 01:07:44.772]  The other thing about patsies, of course, is they always do things that are physically impossible.
[01:07:45.152 --> 01:07:48.653]  And I guess the ultimate of physical impossibility is to come back from the dead.
[01:07:49.133 --> 01:08:02.116]  But we find now that Lieutenant General Cohn, the base commander, had pronounced Hassan dead, but then brought him back to life in that same press conference at about 10, 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening of the day of the shooting.
[01:08:02.256 --> 01:08:05.857]  So all of this makes us extremely suspicious.
[01:08:05.917 --> 01:08:07.617]  And then, of course, we can look at Hassan.
[01:08:08.397 --> 01:08:08.617]  I think.
[01:08:25.356 --> 01:08:35.281]  And by the way, people are being court-martialed for criticizing Bush or Obama just slightly, but he's running around doing things that no one would be allowed to do.
[01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:40.824]  Right, he gives this slideshow where he says, we love death more than you love life.
[01:08:41.205 --> 01:08:44.746]  Alright, this is ID format Al Qaeda speak.
[01:08:45.047 --> 01:08:45.867]  This is what U.S.
[01:08:45.927 --> 01:08:48.909]  intelligence thinks comes out of the mouth of Al Qaeda.
[01:08:48.929 --> 01:08:51.150]  And of course, remember, Al Qaeda is this
[01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:59.297]  CIA, Arab Legion, a group of patsies, a group of terrorists and so forth, but run by the Anglo-American intelligence.
[01:08:59.617 --> 01:09:05.563]  But we see Hassan getting away with all kinds of crazy, outrageous things.
[01:09:05.623 --> 01:09:11.188]  He apparently—now, the latest news is that he has business cards saying that he's a soldier of Allah.
[01:09:11.688 --> 01:09:18.194]  He wants to get other soldiers court-martialed based on what they've told him in his psychiatric interviews.
[01:09:18.574 --> 01:09:24.398]  And the way they would set this guy up, one of many, was tell him, oh, you're undercover looking for extremists.
[01:09:25.018 --> 01:09:27.860]  Oh, you're... Again, we've seen this in the past.
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:34.704]  Yes, he maybe thought he was a double agent, but of course he's got to be a double agent who's not that smart.
[01:09:35.345 --> 01:09:46.432]  And indeed, among his supervisors, and this is all right down the road here, between the Bethesda complex, where you have the National Institutes of Health and the National Uniformed Services
[01:09:47.532 --> 01:09:53.094]  And notice he comes out of the same Blacksburg University that the other shooter was produced out of.
[01:09:53.334 --> 01:09:53.534]  Right.
[01:09:53.714 --> 01:09:54.294]  The show.
[01:09:54.734 --> 01:09:56.054]  He's got the show pedigree.
[01:09:56.655 --> 01:10:04.517]  The thing about Hassan that's interesting is, up to now, Islamic fundamentalist terrorists, so-called, come in groups.
[01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:08.798]  They have a communitarian, social aspect to them.
[01:10:09.178 --> 01:10:16.080]  But now this is the first time that I know of, since Sirhan Sirhan, in which time this was a... Of a lone wolf.
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:20.382]  The lone wolf, but the Islamic fundamentalist lone wolf.
[01:10:20.723 --> 01:10:26.326]  The troubled loner who's got the Koran in his hand, allegedly, and is fighting jihad.
[01:10:26.346 --> 01:10:27.567]  So that's a first.
[01:10:28.087 --> 01:10:33.390]  That brings together the Atta kind of guy with the Cho.
[01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:38.733]  In other words, Cho is somebody who comes out of psychiatric clinics, and so does Hassan.
[01:10:38.753 --> 01:10:41.535]  But we see that with Sirhan and McVeigh.
[01:10:41.555 --> 01:10:43.736]  They always have this psychiatric background.
[01:10:44.781 --> 01:10:44.961]  Yes.
[01:10:45.101 --> 01:10:46.543]  But again, now Islamic.
[01:10:46.583 --> 01:10:55.692]  So, the question is, the supervisors at Walter Reed Army Hospital, which is... Walter Reed, of course, is not quite part of that Bethesda thing, but it's just a few miles away.
[01:10:56.152 --> 01:11:00.556]  They have a meeting where they ask, is Major Hassan a psychotic?
[01:11:00.656 --> 01:11:02.198]  And of course, the answer to that is yes.
[01:11:03.107 --> 01:11:12.376]  The big question then is, here is somebody who almost automatically has to have at least a secret level security clearance.
[01:11:12.757 --> 01:11:19.183]  Any army officer, according to what I've been able to find, has to have at least a security clearance of secret.
[01:11:19.223 --> 01:11:20.144]  He may have had more.
[01:11:20.204 --> 01:11:21.785]  He may have had top secret.
[01:11:21.805 --> 01:11:27.471]  He may have had, you know, key and code, cosmic, NATO level, whatever, but at least secret.
[01:11:27.831 --> 01:11:36.975]  So the thing is, when you do these egregious things, and say, we love life more than you love death, that's when somebody's gonna come and investigate you, if only for the security clearance.
[01:11:36.995 --> 01:11:40.797]  Hey, if you have bad credit, you can't get a low-level security clearance.
[01:11:41.457 --> 01:11:49.421]  He's running around saying, I love Al-Qaeda, and they're just like, protecting, protecting, protecting, protecting, and then you've got the drill being reported.
[01:11:49.801 --> 01:11:50.681]  Webster, stay there.
[01:11:50.701 --> 01:11:56.144]  We're gonna finish up with the MO, what you believe really happened, and why they did this.
[01:11:58.783 --> 01:12:00.170]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:12:00.752 --> 01:12:03.244]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:12:04.238 --> 01:12:16.882]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to Fluscam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[01:12:17.622 --> 01:12:29.185]  Learn why Barack Obama's Science Saw recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:32.619]  OxySilver is far safer than colloidal silvers.
[01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:36.880]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting you and your family.
[01:12:37.181 --> 01:12:40.062]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[01:12:40.962 --> 01:12:46.124]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[01:12:46.524 --> 01:12:49.565]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[01:12:49.665 --> 01:12:52.346]  Call toll free 888-KO-GERMS.
[01:12:52.606 --> 01:12:54.907]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:12:55.267 --> 01:12:56.627]  Order OxySilver today.
[01:12:56.747 --> 01:12:58.008]  This call could save your life.
[01:13:00.052 --> 01:13:03.717]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:13:04.078 --> 01:13:07.082]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:07.323 --> 01:13:08.745]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:13:09.443 --> 01:13:12.124]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:12.144 --> 01:13:18.345]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:18.505 --> 01:13:24.027]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:24.047 --> 01:13:33.689]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.910]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:37.471]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:37.731 --> 01:13:40.012]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:40.192 --> 01:13:42.033]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:42.313 --> 01:13:47.136]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:14:58.667 --> 01:15:02.908]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[01:15:03.168 --> 01:15:07.250]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:17.894]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[01:15:18.274 --> 01:15:20.515]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful
[01:15:20.555 --> 01:15:21.055]  We're good to go.

[01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:47.147]  That's HealForGood.com.
[01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:48.287]  He's going the distance.
[01:15:48.447 --> 01:15:49.188]  He's going for speed.
[01:15:49.228 --> 01:15:49.788]  She's all alone.
[01:15:49.808 --> 01:15:50.048]  All alone.
[01:15:50.088 --> 01:15:51.469]  Webster Tarpley, our guest.
[01:16:11.013 --> 01:16:14.315]  Okay, Webster, continue from the point we left off at.
[01:16:14.335 --> 01:16:22.279]  A couple of things that are interesting is that Major Hassan is exchanging emails with this character, Awlaki.
[01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:26.601]  And Awlaki is obviously a kind of pied piper for patsies.
[01:16:27.061 --> 01:16:29.923]  He was a patsy minder for Hani Hanjour.
[01:16:30.583 --> 01:16:37.607]  That's the Pentagon pilot, supposedly, if you believe that he could do those feats of flying, which is completely impossible.
[01:16:37.947 --> 01:16:40.269]  All the top pilots have said it's a complete fraud.
[01:16:40.309 --> 01:16:40.629]  Go ahead.
[01:16:40.809 --> 01:16:53.658]  Al-Aulaqi is also a part of entrapping the Fort Dix 6 as well as this group of dupes in Toronto who took delivery of all that fertilizer, right, from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
[01:16:53.678 --> 01:16:55.640]  So Al-Aulaqi is obviously a provocateur.
[01:16:55.660 --> 01:17:01.604]  And it goes on and on and on and on and Al-Qaeda was admittedly set up by the CIA.
[01:17:01.644 --> 01:17:02.124]  Brzezinski.
[01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:03.105]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:17:03.976 --> 01:17:15.907]  We also have—there is this Joint Terrorism Task Force, where the information about Hassan exchanging emails with al-Awlaki, the Patsy Pied Piper, this was made available.
[01:17:15.947 --> 01:17:19.731]  But between the FBI and the Defense Criminal Investigation Service,
[01:17:20.419 --> 01:17:27.246]  They decided that this was not relevant and that the commanding officer of the base there at Fort Hood should not be told.
[01:17:28.207 --> 01:17:29.028]  So you have all of this.
[01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:34.954]  The other thing is, just like Mohammed Atta, Hassan cannot be a Muslim.
[01:17:35.014 --> 01:17:36.136]  Hassan is someone
[01:17:36.636 --> 01:17:44.480]  And by the way, that means it's really a raunchy club, because in Texas, the ones where you bring your own liquor in are the totally nude.
[01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:07.068]  Okay, well that's where he goes.
[01:18:07.128 --> 01:18:10.851]  So he's been there at least two or three times during the month of October.
[01:18:10.911 --> 01:18:13.673]  So this is a complete farce.
[01:18:13.733 --> 01:18:19.258]  Now, in terms of what happened, I can't tell you exactly what happened.
[01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:20.579]  There are at least two scenarios.
[01:18:21.059 --> 01:18:24.282]  One is that Hassan is simply a psychotic dupe.
[01:18:25.003 --> 01:18:28.287]  And they're on record believing it was a drill.
[01:18:28.608 --> 01:18:29.609]  They all thought that.
[01:18:41.202 --> 01:18:43.063]  You know, it was what we've been through before.
[01:18:43.143 --> 01:18:45.245]  They do this all the time.
[01:18:45.285 --> 01:18:46.065]  We have drills.
[01:18:46.465 --> 01:18:47.806]  They thought they were rubber bullets.
[01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:52.849]  So Hassan might have thought, hey, I'm going to go and be an actor in a drill today.
[01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:55.911]  I'm going to play the Islamic fundamentalist who opens fire.
[01:18:55.951 --> 01:18:59.874]  So, of course, he's going to get up on a chair and yell, allahu akbar, because that's the script.
[01:19:00.374 --> 01:19:08.441]  But then the technicians show up, and the technicians would be other shooters who actually are capable of efficient shooting, right?
[01:19:08.481 --> 01:19:09.521]  More than 100 shots.
[01:19:09.581 --> 01:19:11.803]  That's too much for one person, I think.
[01:19:12.344 --> 01:19:16.087]  Even if he's surrounded by unarmed soldiers, those are still combat veterans.
[01:19:16.107 --> 01:19:19.309]  They can tackle him or come after him or whatever it is.
[01:19:19.649 --> 01:19:22.512]  The other possibility is that Hassan has been put through
[01:19:23.306 --> 01:19:29.632]  Clockwork Orange brainwashing, and that takes us back to Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia.
[01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:31.374]  There's something going on at Blacksburg.
[01:19:31.394 --> 01:19:34.837]  And by the way, that exists, that's been declassified, that stuff is real.
[01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:39.221]  Right, and we know that we've seen Cho kill 32 people plus himself.
[01:19:39.721 --> 01:19:45.363]  We also had, at the same Virginia Tech campus, a Chinese graduate student had her head cut off.
[01:19:45.443 --> 01:19:46.744]  Oh, and I gotta stop you!
[01:19:47.304 --> 01:19:48.145]  This was confirmed.
[01:19:48.185 --> 01:19:50.526]  We first reported it here from students that live there.
[01:19:50.846 --> 01:20:00.130]  They kept having Marine Corps drills with the Marine Corps ROTC of shooting drills and takeovers, and people thought that that was happening again.
[01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:01.910]  Very, very, very interesting.
[01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:06.651]  And then, of course, there was also recently two murders at Virginia Tech in August.
[01:20:06.691 --> 01:20:10.073]  So Virginia Tech is one strange place.
[01:20:10.413 --> 01:20:23.198]  So that would be the possibility that Major Hassan had been put through some kind of heavy-duty, clockwork orange brainwashing so that he was a Manchurian candidate, and if you tell him the code word, he starts shooting.
[01:20:23.258 --> 01:20:23.958]  That's possible.
[01:20:24.199 --> 01:20:24.939]  But even there,
[01:20:25.539 --> 01:20:27.401]  He could be like Sirhan Sirhan.
[01:20:27.721 --> 01:20:33.105]  All indications are Sirhan Sirhan really had a gun and really shot, but that wouldn't have been enough.
[01:20:33.225 --> 01:20:42.093]  In other words... And by the way, the LA Police Department, for those that don't know, the coroner, they all said it was not the caliber that RFK was shot with.
[01:20:42.113 --> 01:20:43.153]  He was shot in the back.
[01:20:43.574 --> 01:20:45.575]  Turns out that guy was CIA.
[01:20:45.976 --> 01:20:47.957]  Other CIA people were photographed there.
[01:20:48.217 --> 01:20:51.180]  This is even mainstream news now that Sirhan was a patsy.
[01:20:51.749 --> 01:21:05.260]  So the idea is that even if Hassan is a brainwashed Patsy who goes there and shoots, to make sure that they get the effect, they've got other shooters who are much more capable, trained marksmen, professional killers.
[01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:11.185]  Or he could just be a radical Muslim extremist that they guided and allowed to attack.
[01:21:12.106 --> 01:21:15.809]  It's possible, although I think that's probably the least likely.
[01:21:15.829 --> 01:21:20.733]  But we know, we know, we know they knew according to their own story and let him do it.
[01:21:24.789 --> 01:21:34.275]  The question is, who in the Defense Intelligence Agency, who in the FBI, and who in this NIH Walter Reed Uniformed Services?
[01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:38.678]  Who are the people who blocked any investigation or actions?
[01:21:38.698 --> 01:21:40.059]  Because those might be the moles.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.482]  And then the final question, why'd they stage it?
[01:21:43.862 --> 01:21:48.946]  Straight ahead, InfoWars.com has this article, Major Hassan, a Fort Hood, a Patsy, and a drill gone wild.
[01:21:48.966 --> 01:21:49.766]  We're on the march.
[01:21:50.267 --> 01:21:51.768]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:52.769 --> 01:21:55.489]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:58.223 --> 01:22:07.331]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:22:07.371 --> 01:22:10.494]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:22:10.734 --> 01:22:16.439]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:22:16.619 --> 01:22:21.103]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:22:21.383 --> 01:22:23.745]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:22:24.005 --> 01:22:33.077]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[01:22:33.197 --> 01:22:38.624]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[01:22:38.764 --> 01:22:40.586]  Help others and earn extra income!
[01:22:40.666 --> 01:22:40.986]  We're good.
[01:22:58.803 --> 01:23:01.404]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:23:01.805 --> 01:23:06.767]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:23:07.147 --> 01:23:08.868]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:13.991]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:23:14.191 --> 01:23:15.152]  How much do you want?
[01:23:15.372 --> 01:23:16.112]  When do you want it?
[01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:18.093]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:23:18.373 --> 01:23:19.194]  When will you need it?
[01:23:19.454 --> 01:23:21.515]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:23:21.655 --> 01:23:22.756]  Will there be any food?
[01:23:22.996 --> 01:23:24.297]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:23:24.957 --> 01:23:26.899]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:23:27.059 --> 01:23:29.581]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:23:29.781 --> 01:23:32.984]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:23:33.364 --> 01:23:36.867]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:23:37.188 --> 01:23:38.168]  How much will you need?
[01:23:38.409 --> 01:23:39.029]  We don't know.
[01:23:39.309 --> 01:23:40.230]  How much do you want?
[01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:41.151]  All you can get.
[01:23:41.171 --> 01:23:42.172]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:23:42.432 --> 01:23:45.193]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:23:45.493 --> 01:23:47.234]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:23:47.254 --> 01:23:48.175]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:23:57.793 --> 01:24:04.657]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:24:04.777 --> 01:24:06.739]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:24:06.879 --> 01:24:09.000]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.641]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:24:10.761 --> 01:24:15.084]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:24:15.244 --> 01:24:17.605]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:24:17.805 --> 01:24:23.609]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:28.535]  Their bestseller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:31.339]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:24:31.439 --> 01:24:34.063]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:24:34.163 --> 01:24:41.333]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:24:41.613 --> 01:24:45.675]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:24:45.755 --> 01:24:45.975]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:24:46.015 --> 01:24:48.156]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloblue.com today.
[01:24:48.176 --> 01:24:52.118]  You have to understand that in all of these events, when it's staged, it's the same MO.
[01:25:12.199 --> 01:25:13.161]  The same handlers.
[01:25:14.303 --> 01:25:21.175]  The drill on 7-7 where the exact same trains, exact same bus were bombed at the exact same time, exact same locations.
[01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:26.693]  I played the clip earlier of visor consultancy head admitting the government hired him to do it.
[01:25:27.053 --> 01:25:28.374]  That way there's a smokescreen.
[01:25:28.654 --> 01:25:33.278]  That way if the patsies get caught by the wrong group, they just say it's part of a drill.
[01:25:33.318 --> 01:25:37.541]  That way if the operatives, the technicians get caught, they just say they were part of the drill.
[01:25:37.741 --> 01:25:43.666]  They use the drills to smokescreen the NSA and other compartments that may pick up the chatter.
[01:25:44.426 --> 01:25:46.807]  All right, we got about four or five minutes left here, Webster.
[01:25:47.147 --> 01:25:49.848]  The motive, obviously, morale's low in the military.
[01:25:50.308 --> 01:25:57.570]  Obama's launching a major escalation of 40,000 troops to the already 300,000 troop force of international U.S.
[01:25:58.230 --> 01:26:06.333]  and Afghan troops, 12 to 1 against the Taliban, i.e., anybody that doesn't pay their opium cut to the central banks.
[01:26:07.213 --> 01:26:14.036]  This is a way to re-launch the war, re-launch the idea that we're under attack, like the staged attack on the Pentagon on 9-11.
[01:26:14.636 --> 01:26:16.737]  This is a way to reignite the fear.
[01:26:16.777 --> 01:26:24.199]  We've seen other patsies lately where the FBI recruits them, cooks the bomb, trains them, tries to get them to bomb buildings in Illinois and other states.
[01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:25.700]  Same replay.
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:32.543]  Building up to another false flag, creating the illusion that we need to keep these wars going.
[01:26:33.084 --> 01:26:37.086]  Webster Tarpley, what's the modus operandi for this false flag?
[01:26:37.858 --> 01:26:39.638]  For now, the goals are two things.
[01:26:39.699 --> 01:26:41.739]  The first is that Obama is stalling.
[01:26:41.819 --> 01:26:46.160]  Obama really is dithering, and there really is a faction fight, I think, in the administration.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:53.842]  You've got a faction in the State Department around this guy Eikenberry and Matthew Ho, who are saying, don't escalate, don't escalate.
[01:26:53.922 --> 01:26:55.343]  Matthew Ho is saying, get out.
[01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:58.904]  That represents a body of opinion in the State Department.
[01:26:58.924 --> 01:27:03.845]  You've even got Biden, who says, don't send more troops, just send more predator drones.
[01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:06.506]  So I think the rogue network, meaning this Wall Street
[01:27:06.946 --> 01:27:07.247]  I think so.
[01:27:24.768 --> 01:27:39.940]  And notice this is all being launched right as the new show trial for the 9-11 patsies where they admit they've been torturing and threatening to torture their children to get them to confess to building bombings where buildings didn't exist when they were arrested.
[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.301]  Just totally made up.
[01:27:41.761 --> 01:27:50.807]  The other thing, of course, is that Obama is worried about his own political future, and that does play a role, although not the major role.
[01:27:50.907 --> 01:27:55.110]  But is this a test to test the waters for a bigger false flag?
[01:27:57.129 --> 01:28:00.850]  No, Obama's basically saying, if I do this, I'm going to lose my whole left wing.
[01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:08.233]  And in fact, there's going to be an emergency anti-war demonstration here in Washington on December 12th in Lafayette Park at the White House.
[01:28:08.273 --> 01:28:13.235]  So Obama's going to hear protests through his own windows, which has been a rare event up to now.
[01:28:14.781 --> 01:28:18.564]  The other thing is that you have the anti-Obama opposition growing.
[01:28:19.485 --> 01:28:26.952]  The rogue network would like to endow that opposition with Islamophobia, hatred of Arabs, hatred of Muslims, and so forth.
[01:28:26.972 --> 01:28:36.240]  You look at what Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, and so forth are doing, this is now straight delirium of hatred against Islam.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:39.183]  Now, a third level, maybe the higher level,
[01:28:40.362 --> 01:28:46.828]  We also have this dollar crisis going on, and there may be a group in the ruling elite that can control this rogue network.
[01:28:47.458 --> 01:28:48.038]  Thank you.
[01:29:17.398 --> 01:29:18.019]  I think at least.
[01:29:18.419 --> 01:29:25.126]  And by the way, Reuters today, IMF head eyes global currency change, presses on yuan.
[01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:35.637]  The imperative of greater global currency stability means the world can no longer rely as it's done since the end of the gold standard on currency issued by a single country, the head of the IMF said on Tuesday.
[01:29:36.377 --> 01:29:39.240]  That's Dominic Strauss-Kahn, the Bilderberg Group member.
[01:29:39.881 --> 01:29:42.705]  And there's all this propaganda about how this has got to happen.
[01:29:43.025 --> 01:29:44.427]  Webster, this is too important.
[01:29:44.467 --> 01:29:57.183]  Let me have the guys talk to you off-air for a part two on the dollar and your breakdown on the different options the controllers have and what cards you think they're going to play in the near future.
[01:29:57.503 --> 01:30:03.187]  But I really want to thank you for the amazing piece that you wrote and sent to us to post at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:03.548 --> 01:30:06.730]  Major Hassan on Fort Hood, a Patsy and a drill gone live.
[01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:10.053]  You've only seen the tip of the iceberg with Webster in the last 30 minutes here.
[01:30:10.393 --> 01:30:16.638]  Be sure and visit InfoWars.com or WebsterTarpley.com or the other sites to read this for yourself.
[01:30:16.898 --> 01:30:19.660]  Webster, let me put you on hold, have the crew talk to you.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.684]  If you can come back on for another 30 minutes later on the week, just on the dollar, a separate subject.
[01:30:24.984 --> 01:30:26.986]  Thank you so much for your penetrating analysis.
[01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:30.590]  Alright, there goes Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:35.291]  Shifting gears, I have a giant stack of news I haven't even blitzed yet.
[01:30:35.611 --> 01:30:47.193]  Speaking of the Taliban being a staged operation, the Times of London and others, MSNBC reported on the airlift of evil in January and February of 2002, how 6,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda commanders
[01:30:50.578 --> 01:30:54.059]  were flown out to safety into Pakistan by the CIA.
[01:30:54.559 --> 01:30:59.260]  Generals and people would capture them in order to release them, and how they would be paid in gold.
[01:31:00.641 --> 01:31:04.462]  Here it is again, yesterday, Times of London.
[01:31:04.842 --> 01:31:07.403]  Army tells its soldiers to bribe the Taliban.
[01:31:07.423 --> 01:31:09.483]  Give me a close shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:31:10.044 --> 01:31:13.685]  Army tells its soldiers to bribe the Taliban with gold.
[01:31:15.481 --> 01:31:18.762]  And it says, give them bags of gold like the U.S.
[01:31:18.822 --> 01:31:19.123]  does.
[01:31:19.563 --> 01:31:22.684]  Give them bags of gold.
[01:31:24.805 --> 01:31:28.166]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, it's just, it's totally staged.
[01:31:28.807 --> 01:31:33.789]  The higher levels are just globalist mercenaries and they've got little Muslim extremists that work for them.
[01:31:34.169 --> 01:31:35.129]  This is the facts.
[01:31:35.469 --> 01:31:36.370]  This is the history.
[01:31:40.231 --> 01:31:41.192]  Shifting gears now.
[01:31:43.624 --> 01:31:47.268]  I want to play a few minutes from the movie The Watchman.
[01:31:47.808 --> 01:32:01.221]  When it was in theaters a few months ago, a big smash hit, I knew that the writer of the original comic strip is an admitted aluminist and into high-level 33rd degree masonry.
[01:32:03.062 --> 01:32:04.444]  And so I went to see the film.
[01:32:06.305 --> 01:32:08.508]  And the only thing we've edited out of this is some of the cussing.
[01:32:09.488 --> 01:32:16.196]  And under fair use, I'm going to play this so we can break down a few minutes of the film and analyze what's going on.
[01:32:16.276 --> 01:32:23.424]  But I'm going to talk more about this later in the week because we're running out of time and there's so much evidence on this front.
[01:32:23.564 --> 01:32:26.928]  But what we're dealing with here is revelation of the method.
[01:32:27.569 --> 01:32:38.440]  The elite believes in their own writings that they must tell you what they're going to do to you beforehand, and that they must explain to you through fiction why they're doing what they're doing.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:42.925]  It's just like in a sword fight with gentlemen when they say, on guard or unguard.
[01:32:43.585 --> 01:32:44.086]  On guard!
[01:32:44.206 --> 01:32:45.287]  I'm about to attack you!
[01:32:45.527 --> 01:32:46.048]  On guard!
[01:32:46.568 --> 01:32:47.409]  I'm coming at you!
[01:32:47.589 --> 01:32:48.070]  On guard!
[01:32:49.926 --> 01:32:51.727]  Dean Hagelin got a phone call.
[01:32:51.787 --> 01:32:55.749]  He was going to be in town, one of the stars of the X-Files, lone gunman, Fox TV.
[01:32:56.589 --> 01:32:58.490]  He calls me and he says, I want to come to town.
[01:32:59.010 --> 01:33:04.653]  The CIA came and gave us different plots for both of the TV shows.
[01:33:06.394 --> 01:33:19.240]  And the CIA basically told Chris Carter to produce a show where a hijacked jet is flown to the World Trade Center by a secret group inside the military industrial complex, a rogue group, a mole group.
[01:33:20.873 --> 01:33:34.300]  They remote control the jet, they use drills of hijackings and a terror drill to make NORAD stand down, to fly the plane into the World Trade Center, to blame it on Islamist terrorists so they can invade Afghanistan.
[01:33:35.981 --> 01:33:40.483]  Now, this aired six months before 9-11.
[01:33:41.123 --> 01:33:42.123]  We played it many times.
[01:33:42.644 --> 01:33:45.025]  Just Google, Lone Gunman episode 9-11.
[01:33:45.305 --> 01:33:46.225]  It's all over YouTube.
[01:33:46.245 --> 01:33:47.106]  It's all over everywhere.
[01:33:48.462 --> 01:33:57.970]  Or you can go to Best Buy or wherever and buy the one-year series of The Lone Gunman, the episode, what, 10 episodes, and you can watch it in high quality.
[01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.990]  We actually bought a copy of it.
[01:33:59.631 --> 01:34:02.393]  There's hundreds of these examples.
[01:34:04.315 --> 01:34:08.118]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[01:34:09.939 --> 01:34:11.780]  Where they tell you what they're going to do.
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.683]  They had oil storm, again, six months before Katrina.
[01:34:16.014 --> 01:34:20.079]  The mayor was even part of the production, where it hits, it floods it, martial law happens.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:22.621]  We know they have weather control systems.
[01:34:22.641 --> 01:34:27.687]  I've interviewed the creator of it, Ben Livingston, meteorologist.
[01:34:28.107 --> 01:34:29.309]  They're now admitting all this.
[01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:33.053]  Weather control is being admitted by the White House science czar, John P. Holdren.
[01:34:35.015 --> 01:34:36.477]  But, look, it goes on and on.
[01:34:37.386 --> 01:34:43.969]  The issue here is, psychopaths love to brag, they love to taunt the police, they love to toy with people.
[01:34:44.049 --> 01:34:46.150]  This is their modus operandi.
[01:34:46.190 --> 01:34:53.693]  Now, when you go watch this two-hour film, and don't show it to children, it's very violent, especially the director's cut, the widescreen edition.
[01:34:55.282 --> 01:35:01.067]  But you should watch it, because when I walked out of the theater, almost everyone was saying, I don't get it, I don't understand it.
[01:35:01.607 --> 01:35:07.352]  I saw review after review after review that said, no one understands this.
[01:35:08.153 --> 01:35:13.097]  This would be like showing someone 2 plus 2 equals 4 and they don't understand it.
[01:35:13.797 --> 01:35:21.984]  They explain in the movie that this Mandamus character, who's like the Luciferian enlightened one,
[01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:35.159]  That he stages terror attacks and blows up all these world cities killing millions and millions of people so that the world will come together for a world government.
[01:35:37.321 --> 01:35:40.904]  And he admits they staged World War I, World War II, the Cold War.
[01:35:40.944 --> 01:35:45.187]  It's all staged to bring in this one world government so there'll be total peace.
[01:35:45.687 --> 01:35:56.956]  Now the only true superhero in it, Dr. Manhattan, who can create planets, do whatever he wants, be anywhere in the universe, he is trying to stop whoever's blowing up US cities.
[01:35:57.997 --> 01:36:00.459]  Until he finally catches his former partner,
[01:36:03.985 --> 01:36:08.827]  And that's the scene we're going to play where he catches him and he explains, I had to do it to create unity.
[01:36:09.147 --> 01:36:12.028]  And then Dr. Manhattan says, oh, you're right, I understand.
[01:36:12.068 --> 01:36:18.070]  And the moral person, Rorschach, who goes out and kills child molesters and people, he's the bad guy at the end.
[01:36:18.090 --> 01:36:21.451]  And they go, yes, you're trying to stop child molesters.
[01:36:21.471 --> 01:36:22.311]  That's earlier in the movie.
[01:36:22.651 --> 01:36:23.651]  You are the bad one.
[01:36:24.352 --> 01:36:27.773]  You don't like raping children and dogs eating their rotten bodies.
[01:36:28.153 --> 01:36:28.873]  You are bad.
[01:36:29.633 --> 01:36:31.734]  And Dr. Manhattan kills him.
[01:36:35.316 --> 01:36:37.096]  This is a day we shall never forget.
[01:36:38.737 --> 01:36:49.259]  And yet we go forward to defend the human race and all that is good and just in our world.
[01:36:49.279 --> 01:36:51.119]  Thank you.
[01:36:51.199 --> 01:36:52.219]  God bless us all.
[01:36:52.719 --> 01:36:57.500]  Do you see it?
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.641]  Two superpowers retreating from war.
[01:37:00.801 --> 01:37:03.162]  I've saved the Earth from hell.
[01:37:04.262 --> 01:37:04.842]  We both have.
[01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:12.935]  This is as much your victory as it is mine.
[01:37:13.735 --> 01:37:14.856]  Now we can return.
[01:37:16.658 --> 01:37:17.578]  Do what we were meant to.
[01:37:18.059 --> 01:37:19.920]  We were meant to exact justice.
[01:37:21.762 --> 01:37:23.403]  Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
[01:37:23.863 --> 01:37:24.264]  Will they?
[01:37:25.464 --> 01:37:29.768]  By exposing me, you would sacrifice the peace so many died for today.
[01:37:30.208 --> 01:37:31.349]  Peace based on a lie.
[01:37:31.709 --> 01:37:32.250]  But peace...
[01:37:33.919 --> 01:37:35.800]  Nonetheless, he's right.
[01:37:36.721 --> 01:37:40.483]  Exposing Hadrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.
[01:37:40.783 --> 01:37:40.964]  No.
[01:37:40.984 --> 01:37:43.085]  We can't do this.
[01:37:43.105 --> 01:37:44.226]  On Mars.
[01:37:47.087 --> 01:37:48.428]  You taught me the value of life.
[01:37:49.869 --> 01:37:54.052]  If we hope to preserve it here, we must remain silent.
[01:37:58.915 --> 01:38:00.056]  Keep your own secrets.
[01:38:07.788 --> 01:38:08.729]  Don't even think about it.
[01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:12.210]  Rorschach!
[01:38:15.072 --> 01:38:15.332]  Wait.
[01:38:17.693 --> 01:38:18.593]  Never compromise.
[01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:21.735]  Not even in the face of Armageddon.
[01:38:23.416 --> 01:38:25.557]  It's always been the difference between us, Daniel.
[01:38:37.446 --> 01:38:39.708]  I've made myself feel every death.
[01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:46.973]  See every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity.
[01:38:47.593 --> 01:38:55.058]  You understand, don't you?
[01:38:56.119 --> 01:38:57.060]  Without condemning.
[01:38:59.401 --> 01:39:00.002]  Or condemning.
[01:39:05.566 --> 01:39:06.146]  I understand.
[01:39:12.099 --> 01:39:12.379]  Dad.
[01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:18.661]  A world united in a peace... that had to be sacrificed.
[01:39:19.122 --> 01:39:19.342]  No!
[01:39:19.942 --> 01:39:22.983]  You haven't idealized mankind, but you've deformed it!
[01:39:23.663 --> 01:39:24.563]  You've mutilated it!
[01:39:25.624 --> 01:39:26.504]  That's your legacy.
[01:39:26.524 --> 01:39:28.925]  Out of my way.
[01:39:29.885 --> 01:39:30.946]  People have to be told.
[01:39:30.966 --> 01:39:33.607]  You know I can't let you do that.
[01:39:35.387 --> 01:39:37.048]  Suddenly you discover humanity.
[01:39:46.598 --> 01:39:47.819]  I should have cared from the start.
[01:39:49.101 --> 01:39:50.142]  None of this would have happened.
[01:39:50.182 --> 01:39:57.549]  What are you waiting for?
[01:39:57.569 --> 01:39:57.989]  Do it.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.460]  And now he's dead.
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:31.182]  There's the beautiful Rorschach pattern of his blood and guts, the beauty, the artwork of Dr. Manhattan.
[01:40:31.482 --> 01:40:36.463]  And Dr. Manhattan is being blamed for all these cities worldwide and tens of millions dead.
[01:40:38.539 --> 01:40:45.321]  Blamed by his former partner that actually staged the terror attacks to bring the world together with the outside threat.
[01:40:47.001 --> 01:40:49.062]  And that's why the Pentagon staged 9-11.
[01:40:49.422 --> 01:40:55.203]  They think it's beautiful and good they killed 3,000 people so they can have their world government to bring you peace.
[01:40:55.243 --> 01:40:57.304]  That's why they gave nukes to North Korea.
[01:40:57.484 --> 01:40:59.084]  That's why they gave nukes to Pakistan.
[01:40:59.304 --> 01:41:01.525]  That's why they create Saddam and Bin Laden.
[01:41:01.805 --> 01:41:05.226]  So they can be the good guy that saves you from all of it.
[01:41:06.411 --> 01:41:07.571]  But that's only one level.
[01:41:07.971 --> 01:41:25.457]  But this is still very high-level Illuminati, New World Order programming, the dark side reaching out to you at a subconscious level, the general public having no idea the high-level ritual they've just been part of, not understanding it, wandering out of the movie theater saying, I didn't get that.
[01:41:26.717 --> 01:41:30.198]  They staged the terror attacks to bring in world government.
[01:41:31.650 --> 01:41:36.171]  Justice Kissinger says in real documents they have the stage events, stage crises.
[01:41:36.591 --> 01:41:42.033]  This is the reality of the New World Order.
[01:41:44.214 --> 01:41:45.374]  This is what they're doing.
[01:41:45.974 --> 01:41:47.354]  This is what they're setting up.
[01:41:47.735 --> 01:41:49.055]  This is why they kill us.
[01:41:49.455 --> 01:41:50.775]  This is why they do everything.
[01:41:50.835 --> 01:41:52.436]  And Rorschach is the bad guy.
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:55.740]  He doesn't like them murdering children.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:57.621]  He doesn't like child molesters.
[01:41:57.721 --> 01:41:58.641]  He's the bad guy.
[01:41:58.881 --> 01:42:02.162]  The message is, he's the bad guy because he has morals.
[01:42:02.642 --> 01:42:05.323]  And if you watch the whole movie, he is the bad guy.
[01:42:06.003 --> 01:42:07.243]  He is the evil person.
[01:42:08.503 --> 01:42:09.664]  And that's how the globalist are.
[01:42:09.684 --> 01:42:15.385]  We talked to Dr. Bianca, the local guy that says 90% of the public have to be killed by airborne Ebola.
[01:42:17.059 --> 01:42:19.440]  He says, oh, I'm very sad that my family and I have to die.
[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:25.604]  You know, it's the same thing of, oh, I'm very sad that we all have to die, but it's what we have to do to save the Earth.
[01:42:25.804 --> 01:42:28.745]  We've got to do something for the Earth when it's all a fraud.
[01:42:29.125 --> 01:42:30.686]  This is their pure evil.
[01:42:31.166 --> 01:42:32.707]  This is their corruption.
[01:42:33.228 --> 01:42:34.408]  This is what they're doing.
[01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:37.590]  This is how they're throwing it in your face like you're morons.
[01:42:38.951 --> 01:42:44.834]  They're going to bring in world government and kill 80-90% of us in their own government textbooks like eco-science.
[01:42:45.074 --> 01:42:50.337]  You better wake up, you better realize what's going on, and you better understand they've warned you.
[01:42:51.017 --> 01:42:52.478]  World government is only the beginning.
[01:42:53.638 --> 01:42:58.141]  Once they have it in place, you're as dead as a doornail through soft kill weapons.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:04.644]  I have owned every light you can think of, and my Paclite is the one I refuse to leave home without.
[01:43:04.784 --> 01:43:06.546]  That's what Jerry from Oregon said.
[01:43:06.706 --> 01:43:08.027]  Your flashlights are the best.
[01:43:08.187 --> 01:43:14.032]  We bought some three years ago, and all three Paclites have gone through two hurricanes each, and they just keep going on and on.
[01:43:14.252 --> 01:43:17.335]  And that's what Albert in Florida said about the amazing Paclite.
[01:43:17.495 --> 01:43:24.921]  Paclite's multicolored calves come equipped with two high-powered LED lights, snap on to any 9-volt battery, and will last over 1,200 hours.
[01:43:25.142 --> 01:43:26.803]  Listen to what Jerry from Michigan said.
[01:43:27.023 --> 01:43:30.165]  After carrying a pack light in my pants pocket for two years, it was bound to happen.
[01:43:30.405 --> 01:43:33.066]  The pants and the light went through the wash together and it still works.
[01:43:33.226 --> 01:43:35.187]  The pack light has a 25 year warranty.
[01:43:35.288 --> 01:43:38.269]  Starts at just twelve ninety nine and is an excellent gift idea.

[01:44:00.704 --> 01:44:04.369]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:04.710 --> 01:44:07.754]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:07.974 --> 01:44:09.396]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:10.091 --> 01:44:12.733]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:12.753 --> 01:44:19.037]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:19.157 --> 01:44:24.180]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:34.326]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world governments.
[01:44:34.446 --> 01:44:36.547]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:36.787 --> 01:44:38.107]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:38.367 --> 01:44:40.648]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:40.828 --> 01:44:42.688]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:42.968 --> 01:44:47.769]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:46:03.549 --> 01:46:05.310]  We're gonna have open phones again tomorrow.
[01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:06.750]  Tons of news blitzing.
[01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:09.191]  We're taking this radio transmission to the next level.
[01:46:18.291 --> 01:46:23.275]  But I wanted, at the end of the radio show today, because gold went up above $1,140.
[01:46:23.455 --> 01:46:28.379]  It's just rising, rising, rising to have Ted up.
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:31.882]  He has a few of the gold items left.
[01:46:31.962 --> 01:46:32.523]  Very few.
[01:46:33.777 --> 01:46:36.018]  At the $1,000 level.
[01:46:36.038 --> 01:46:40.720]  That is, he bought into the market when it was $140-something bucks lower than it is now.
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.561]  So he can pass on those savings.
[01:46:43.041 --> 01:46:44.962]  Some of the other stuff went up to around $1,050.
[01:46:46.203 --> 01:46:48.944]  Still $90-plus under what the market is.
[01:46:49.204 --> 01:46:51.125]  You're not going to find deals like this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:51.165 --> 01:46:52.485]  Ted is a big gold broker.
[01:46:52.766 --> 01:46:55.667]  He gives these specials to my listeners because he's a patriot.
[01:46:56.547 --> 01:46:58.288]  And he loves to be competitive.
[01:46:58.308 --> 01:46:59.248]  He's a free market guy, 110%.
[01:47:01.747 --> 01:47:03.369]  Again, I told you to buy gold when it was $280, $300, $400, $500, $600, $700, $800, $500, $900, $1,000.
[01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:06.072]  It just goes up and up because they're devaluing the dollar.
[01:47:06.092 --> 01:47:07.014]  You need to physically hold silver and gold.
[01:47:07.034 --> 01:47:07.775]  Ted, tell people today's offer.
[01:47:17.671 --> 01:47:20.773]  What I have going today are the things that I offered from yesterday.
[01:47:20.793 --> 01:47:21.254]  The $10 Liberties at $8.18.50.
[01:47:21.314 --> 01:47:21.934]  I have $20 Liberties at $16.32.
[01:47:22.014 --> 01:47:22.595]  I still have Lakotas.
[01:47:22.675 --> 01:47:24.096]  Right now they're currently at $222.44.
[01:47:24.136 --> 01:47:24.797]  Walking Liberty Halves at $8.69.
[01:47:24.897 --> 01:47:25.777]  British Sovereigns
[01:47:35.845 --> 01:47:37.206]  Right now we're at $3.25.
[01:47:37.267 --> 01:47:43.813]  They just went up from $2.99, and the Franks went from $246 to $263.
[01:47:44.033 --> 01:47:47.717]  So congratulations to all of you who have picked those up.
[01:47:47.737 --> 01:47:49.158]  But the rest of the market's moving.
[01:47:49.439 --> 01:47:51.281]  There are a few other items that I have.
[01:47:51.701 --> 01:47:53.883]  I don't have enough to mention it because people are going to call up.
[01:47:53.943 --> 01:47:55.605]  It's going to be sold out by the time they get in.
[01:47:55.785 --> 01:48:01.511]  Even your new deal, because you sold out of the super low, it's still, what, 90-something dollars lower in the market?
[01:48:01.871 --> 01:48:04.794]  Yeah, it's all discounted based upon what I bought in the past.
[01:48:04.814 --> 01:48:06.976]  So right now, this is a good time to be buying.
[01:48:07.637 --> 01:48:09.459]  And, you know, I don't know what you need.
[01:48:09.479 --> 01:48:12.141]  I mean, the market is saying, get into gold.
[01:48:12.602 --> 01:48:14.264]  The dollar is falling.
[01:48:14.744 --> 01:48:15.545]  Look at Reuters!
[01:48:15.625 --> 01:48:16.226]  Look at Reuters!
[01:48:16.446 --> 01:48:18.748]  IMF head eyes global currency change.
[01:48:19.289 --> 01:48:21.671]  I mean, that is, that is Reuters today.
[01:48:21.691 --> 01:48:25.455]  I'll give ThePresentPlanet.tv viewers, I mean, gold, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:48:25.815 --> 01:48:26.917]  Get involved in it now!
[01:48:26.937 --> 01:48:27.597]  800-686-2237.
[01:48:28.899 --> 01:48:31.782]  Ted, can you hold this deal until midnight again?
[01:48:31.962 --> 01:48:33.844]  Yes, I will hold this deal until midnight.
[01:48:34.605 --> 01:48:41.208]  But I really want to encourage people to get in and get involved with this because the market's running away from them.
[01:48:41.228 --> 01:48:42.949]  800-686-2237.
[01:48:42.969 --> 01:48:43.989]  800-686-2237.
[01:48:46.010 --> 01:48:49.972]  We ought to pull up some video clips from a couple years ago when gold's like 500 bucks an ounce.
[01:48:50.232 --> 01:48:51.072]  And I'm like, get in!
[01:48:51.873 --> 01:48:53.033]  I think it's only going to go up.
[01:48:53.433 --> 01:48:58.736]  I mean, to really show people, to illustrate what's happening, 800-686-2237.
[01:48:59.096 --> 01:49:01.357]  They are openly announcing they're gutting the dollar.
[01:49:02.097 --> 01:49:06.019]  I mean, and ladies and gentlemen, there's no other investment out there that's quadrupled.
[01:49:06.059 --> 01:49:11.861]  It's now quadrupled from 260 up to over 1,140 right now.
[01:49:11.881 --> 01:49:14.282]  I mean, what else is doing that?
[01:49:14.302 --> 01:49:15.883]  800-686-2237.
[01:49:15.943 --> 01:49:20.825]  Ted, you got to feel good being able to offer deals that no one else can even come close to.
[01:49:21.045 --> 01:49:27.108]  Well, what's really great is when my customers need to sell back to me and I'm giving them this $400 increase in their portfolio.
[01:49:27.548 --> 01:49:27.888]  It's just
[01:49:28.755 --> 01:49:32.039]  You know, it really feels good to know that I'm helping people.
[01:49:32.059 --> 01:49:36.043]  So you are, some people are selling their gold back to you that bought it at 500 bucks an ounce?
[01:49:36.203 --> 01:49:38.206]  You know, people, you know, some people die.
[01:49:38.246 --> 01:49:43.812]  I had a guy come in, one guy picked up over a million dollars worth of gold from us down there when gold was at about 400.
[01:49:44.953 --> 01:49:46.794]  His brother came in who got the inheritance.
[01:49:46.854 --> 01:49:47.654]  He was laid off.
[01:49:48.074 --> 01:49:53.736]  He was able to sell about $150,000 worth of gold four times higher than the customer had bought it.
[01:49:54.156 --> 01:49:55.317]  That's just one example.
[01:49:55.697 --> 01:49:59.498]  And you gotta understand, Ted Anderson has literally tiny markups.
[01:49:59.518 --> 01:50:01.039]  He's making just tiny slivers.
[01:50:01.639 --> 01:50:03.721]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.702]  And the key here is, tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[01:50:25.722 --> 01:50:27.463]  You'll be paying more, and it's still a great price.
[01:50:27.483 --> 01:50:28.024]  800-686-2237.
