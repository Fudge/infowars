[00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:03.065]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.469]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.962 --> 00:00:19.585]  With us, 5-10 minutes into the next hour with his monthly visit is Mike Ribeiro, fellow talk show host here on Genesis.
[00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.086]  We're going to go to him in one moment to get into the flu.
[00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:27.890]  His perspective on that, always enjoy getting his interesting take on things, very well informed.
[00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.632]  And we've got William Louis Gary Franchi later in the next hour joining us.
[00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:35.274]  How the Hardin, Montana, with the biggest developments yet coming out on this.
[00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:38.734]  How that ties into their film, Camp FEMA.
[00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:40.535]  That's going to be very, very informative.
[00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:43.857]  And we'll continue with open phones in the fourth hour today.
[00:00:44.517 --> 00:00:49.640]  There is a key story up on PrisonPlanet.com that I worked on with Paul Watson.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.382]  It's doctors concerned flu-miss vaccine could spread live H1N1 virus.
[00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:56.484]  Now, people, the COINTELPRO,
[00:00:57.404 --> 00:01:00.645]  Always accuse me of exaggerating or trying to scare people.
[00:01:00.705 --> 00:01:02.065]  No, it's actually much scarier.
[00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:11.467]  If you read what the Mayo Clinic said and all these other mainstream documents and the inserts and what Fox News is even saying, no, they admit it will spread the virus.
[00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:15.788]  And it's a live virus.
[00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:16.768]  And it will mutate.
[00:01:16.908 --> 00:01:18.889]  And some will be weaker, some will be stronger.
[00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.989]  So see, Watson gave that a weak headline.
[00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:24.697]  Nine times out of ten, we do.
[00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:28.538]  It's worse than this headline, but this article's got all the facts.
[00:01:29.018 --> 00:01:29.959]  It needs to be gotten out.
[00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.220]  Doctors concerned flu-miss vaccine could spread live H1N1 virus.
[00:01:35.117 --> 00:01:36.097]  Well, 60% of the U.S.
[00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:39.799]  population at risk is swine flu, nasal spray, a pandemic waiting to happen.
[00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:41.860]  Now, Mike got cut off.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.362]  I promised to go to Mike, a listener from Tennessee, about neighbors like it's a rock star, it's a fad, or ooh, they're getting it.
[00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:54.825]  Oh yeah, and when your kids get brain damaged, it's like a fad, you know, for the breast cancer, a fad for the autism, or a fad for
[00:01:56.152 --> 00:01:58.593]  You know, a third of the kids in my neighborhood are dying of cancer.
[00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:01.215]  You know, people in my office that I know are dying of cancer.
[00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:02.635]  Their girlfriends are dying of cancer.
[00:02:04.096 --> 00:02:08.699]  Rob Dues, 30-something-year-old friend, been in a band with him for 10 years, she just died of cancer last week.
[00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:16.243]  Just, you know, oh, but we have meetings about it, and we talk about it, and we make it all fancy and fun, and how about we stop taking their shots?
[00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:19.804]  See, because it's not my opinion they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[00:02:19.824 --> 00:02:20.585]  They said they'd do it.
[00:02:21.065 --> 00:02:22.506]  It's in the government documents.
[00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:23.486]  It's in eco-science.
[00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:24.527]  They're poisoning our water.
[00:02:25.592 --> 00:02:29.714]  I mean, look, the reason they're getting away with this is the horror factor.
[00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:31.174]  No one can deal with that.
[00:02:31.214 --> 00:02:33.956]  It's hard for me to deal with that they're doing this.
[00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:41.399]  The only reason they don't kill me is because they know I'm telling an extremely accurate representation of what's really going on.
[00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.700]  I'm not perfect, but I got a good picture on me.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.881]  My scope's got them in the sights.
[00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:53.924]  And they sure don't want to kill me and make a big example out of it, folks, because I'm dead on with what they're doing because I read their textbooks.
[00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:58.166]  Let me tell you, I mean, I spend hours every day researching what I talk about here.
[00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:01.048]  And let me tell you, there's no going back once you know this.
[00:03:02.428 --> 00:03:06.970]  Then you can't even hate the cops when they violate the First Amendment and say no protest allowed in D.C.
[00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.792]  or Pittsburgh and beat women in the head and have police dogs attack women.
[00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:22.100]  You don't like them, you're angry at them, you think they're thugs, but you know those idiots are drinking sodium fluoride water, they're taking vaccines, their kids are taking it, you want to save them!
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:32.029]  You want to stop fighting with them and reach out to them and splash some cold water in their face psychologically and say, look, look at what we're saying!
[00:03:33.957 --> 00:03:42.221]  Live flu virus is the first vaccine they're putting out, admitting it will spread the real flu, then it creates all this fear that everybody gets the shot.
[00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:43.442]  It's hidden in plain view.
[00:03:43.462 --> 00:03:47.044]  I'm going to get Mike Rivero's take on that in a moment, but I promise to go to Mike in Tennessee.
[00:03:47.064 --> 00:03:49.045]  Mike, finish the point you were trying to make.
[00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:49.485]  Go ahead.
[00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:58.069]  Well, real quick, this lady that I spoke to today, she was talking, she's always getting the flu shot, and she can't wait to get her child the swine flu shot.
[00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.492]  Talked about she wanted her child, she always gets her child everything, anything they say that she needs.
[00:04:03.914 --> 00:04:10.157]  She's the first one in line to get it as though it's somewhat like an accessory, a purse, a new pair of shoes or something.
[00:04:10.698 --> 00:04:27.747]  And today in this, uh, one of the dying papers around the country, the Commercial Appeal, the article in here talks about the lady who tilted her head back, the first person in the country to get the swine flu sniffer, says she tilted her head back and sniffed hard and became the first American to be given the H1N1 flu vaccine.
[00:04:28.147 --> 00:04:29.968]  And then real quick, and I know you gotta go,
[00:04:30.973 --> 00:04:47.985]  On the intersection, buried in the paper, the part that you probably wouldn't read unless you're like me and you read every bit of this, it says, workers at Le Bonheur who received the vaccine Monday had to sign a consent form and were given a CDC card proving they were given the drug.
[00:04:48.846 --> 00:04:50.247]  A CDC card to prove it.
[00:04:51.168 --> 00:04:52.328]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.511]  We covered this yesterday, and this is all admitted.
[00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:58.793]  AP, Reuters, I'm going to go back over to Mike Rivera coming up.
[00:04:58.813 --> 00:04:59.614]  We're going to Mike right now.
[00:05:01.044 --> 00:05:11.153]  They admit that it's a live virus, that the perfect place for it to breed and mutate is the nasal passages and the mucous membranes of the sinus.
[00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:12.714]  Sinus is huge.
[00:05:12.754 --> 00:05:13.735]  It sits up underneath the brain.
[00:05:15.677 --> 00:05:17.138]  The sinus is very large.
[00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:21.682]  But the point is, in fact, maybe we should pull up a Google image of the sinus.
[00:05:23.618 --> 00:05:27.279]  And let people see how it sits behind the nose, right underneath the brain.
[00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.981]  They pump it in there, it breathes, and then they admit that no H1N1 trials were done.
[00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:39.063]  I have those headlines that the trial is the people being given the live mutating virus.
[00:05:43.128 --> 00:05:48.353]  It's so huge, it's so obvious, it's so out in the open, and now it's going to spread everywhere.
[00:05:48.593 --> 00:05:51.515]  People kept saying, this is very weak, this isn't killing hardly anybody.
[00:05:51.816 --> 00:05:55.158]  This is, on the scale, much weaker than the regular seasonal flu.
[00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:55.899]  Why all the fear?
[00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:57.641]  Because they're going to spread it and mutate it.
[00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:58.982]  Let's go to Mike Rivera.
[00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:00.423]  Mike, what do you think about what's happening?
[00:06:01.212 --> 00:06:11.000]  Well, it's a very dangerous and reckless approach to this kind of a medical situation, and over at WhatReallyHappened.com, we just posted an article from one of the German newspapers, German magazines.
[00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:18.046]  They're basically saying the same thing, that if you get the swine flu vaccine, it will make you more likely to come down with the swine flu.
[00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:20.328]  Well, that's actually the CDC.
[00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:24.132]  The CDC says if you take the swine flu shot, you're more likely to get it.
[00:06:24.172 --> 00:06:25.633]  I mean, I have that in my stack.
[00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:26.774]  That's what I mean.
[00:06:26.814 --> 00:06:27.455]  This is insane!
[00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:29.380]  It absolutely is.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.585]  And without even getting into the question of possible motives, at this point I don't even really care.
[00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:36.829]  You go back and you look at the swine flu epidemic and vaccination of 1976.
[00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:41.494]  The vaccine killed 50 times as many people as the flu itself did.
[00:06:41.875 --> 00:06:43.156]  This is nonsense.
[00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:44.718]  It is reckless beyond belief.
[00:06:44.918 --> 00:06:46.220]  They're not testing this stuff.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.605]  And remember, only last year, Baxter allowed a test vaccine out for trials that had live bird flu virus in it.
[00:06:53.926 --> 00:07:00.190]  We don't know if this is the one that was being used up in Norway when they did some tests on some homeless people and a bunch of those people died.
[00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:00.670]  Poland too.
[00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:05.554]  But I mean, obviously something was being tested in Norway that killed a bunch of people.
[00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:16.481]  And it's reckless and it's dangerous, but it's hugely profitable for the pharmaceutical companies who've all made the appropriate tithing to their local congressmen, congressional campaigns.
[00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:19.903]  And it's simply peddling snake oil.
[00:07:19.983 --> 00:07:27.688]  I mean, our current medical establishment in the United States is operating on the same moral and ethical level as the old Wild West traveling medicine show salesman.
[00:07:28.428 --> 00:07:35.690]  Ride the wagon into town, crank down the stage, do a song and dance, make all kinds of claims and sell bottles full of whatever they found out in the desert.
[00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.011]  And you're lucky if it doesn't kill you, let alone actually help you in any way, shape or form.
[00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:41.631]  That's where we are.
[00:07:42.031 --> 00:07:49.773]  We're finding out just yesterday that after decades of all this fluoridation of tap water, it doesn't really have any effect on dental cavities at all.
[00:07:50.113 --> 00:07:51.433]  So why are they putting it in there?
[00:07:51.453 --> 00:07:54.954]  Well, because they need to get rid of the waste product and they can make money doing it.
[00:07:55.294 --> 00:07:57.495]  And it makes people docile in all the studies.
[00:07:57.635 --> 00:08:02.198]  Actually, two years ago, the American Dental Association said, don't have kids, brush their teeth.
[00:08:02.578 --> 00:08:09.702]  It causes fractures in the teeth and dental fluorosis and doubles bone cancer of just one type in boys.
[00:08:10.082 --> 00:08:12.023]  And all the other studies show all these other cancers.
[00:08:12.043 --> 00:08:13.844]  I mean, this is not debatable.
[00:08:14.304 --> 00:08:14.924]  This is a fact.
[00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:16.866]  And you mentioned the stuff in Norway.
[00:08:17.426 --> 00:08:19.247]  The London Telegraph reported that in Poland,
[00:08:20.468 --> 00:08:28.335]  21 of 100 homeless people in a bird flu vaccine trial all died, and that it was an unnamed pharmaceutical company.
[00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:43.829]  So that's confirmed that that was a... But I mean, to see Shepard Smith on Fox saying, it's a conspiracy theory, the swine flu shot cannot hurt you, when I have the insert of the five big makers, every one of the inserts says, Gillian Beret.
[00:08:44.892 --> 00:08:46.833]  Am I pronouncing that right, or Guillain-Barré?
[00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:49.595]  Guillain-Barré.
[00:08:49.675 --> 00:08:50.635]  I mean, I have these.
[00:08:50.755 --> 00:08:51.796]  I'll show them again coming up.
[00:08:51.856 --> 00:08:54.177]  I'll show, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, scans.
[00:08:54.457 --> 00:08:56.919]  They're admitting it causes autoimmune problems.
[00:08:57.099 --> 00:08:58.579]  It's admitting it can give you cancer.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.722]  It says on the insert it can sterilize you or reduce fertility.
[00:09:02.982 --> 00:09:10.026]  I mean, how can Shepard Smith and the rest of TV say it cannot hurt you, knowing it's going to mess a bunch of people up?
[00:09:10.936 --> 00:09:12.639]  They were saying the exact same thing back in 1976.
[00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:25.677]  If you go out on YouTube somebody's put up a video of all the propaganda that was hitting the television airwaves in 1976 about how important it was to get the shot and how it was going to save your life and make you better and of course the exact...
[00:09:26.238 --> 00:09:27.899]  Opposite thing happened here.
[00:09:27.959 --> 00:09:31.862]  It's all about selling product, and they don't really care what it does.
[00:09:32.042 --> 00:09:34.063]  Once it goes out, they've made their money.
[00:09:34.403 --> 00:09:35.164]  They don't care.
[00:09:35.264 --> 00:09:36.965]  And the stuff is incredibly dangerous.
[00:09:36.985 --> 00:09:38.406]  They're not testing it fully.
[00:09:39.067 --> 00:09:43.509]  In some cases, under this so-called fast track, they're not testing some of these adjuvants at all.
[00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.311]  It's just stuff they think will work.
[00:09:45.371 --> 00:09:47.292]  So, hey, let's put it in there and see what happens.
[00:09:47.672 --> 00:09:52.996]  And it's very dangerous because, as you say, we're dealing with a lot of materials which are capable of mutation.
[00:09:53.636 --> 00:09:59.005]  And intermixing within the body and the interactions have never been tested for either with all these adjuvants they're putting together.
[00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:01.408]  This is incredibly dangerous and reckless stuff.
[00:10:02.113 --> 00:10:14.955]  Well, I've got a story up on PrisonPlanet.com that has all these links to Mayo Clinic, Mainstream Reports, where they just calmly announce, oh, this is a live vaccine and it's gonna mutate and gonna spread.
[00:10:14.975 --> 00:10:29.378]  I mean, how obvious is it, Mike, or do you agree, that they're first giving the type that'll spread to actually create the fear and actually spread it and spread sickness and spread people testing positive for the antibodies so they get panicked and get the shot?
[00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:36.633]  I think that's probably exactly what's going on here, because down the road, you know, ultimately, we are going to pay for all of this stuff.
[00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:43.876]  It's always taxpayer-funded, or it comes out of some other way, or there may be somewhere down the road where there's a new vaccine that we have to pay for privately.
[00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:49.639]  It's all about sucking the last of the money out of the American people under any pretext whatsoever.
[00:10:49.699 --> 00:10:52.461]  Swine flu, global warming, health insurance, whatever.
[00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:56.583]  They're grabbing the last few nickels out of our pockets before they ski-daddle for the border.
[00:10:57.563 --> 00:10:59.284]  Well, that was my next point.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.365]  You would think with the media losing credibility, losing ratings, getting discredited, they would start being more credible.
[00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:13.472]  Instead, it seems like the lying has gone tenfold, wall-to-wall, as if they're in panic mode.
[00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:18.651]  I agree, absolutely, and nothing, I think, shows that more than the last two weeks.
[00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:28.456]  We're following on the Goldstone Report about Israel, and then the UN requesting Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to inspections, and Israel says no.
[00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:39.241]  Then Iran turns around and informs the IAEA they're starting to build a new facility, and it shows to the entire world, Iran is playing by the rules, Israel is not, and so what does the American media do?
[00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:43.343]  They crank up this non-stop, rock-and-roll, full-tilt-boogie propaganda campaign,
[00:11:43.783 --> 00:11:53.697]  To resell the idea that Iran are the bad guys, and the US and Israel are the really good guys, and we should not pay attention to the fact that Iran is playing by the rules, because they're only doing it to throw us off.
[00:11:53.717 --> 00:11:58.263]  Mike, let's talk about Iran-Afghanistan next, then get into the debt of the dollar.
[00:11:58.563 --> 00:11:58.984]  Stay with us.
[00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:10.833]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[00:12:11.134 --> 00:12:15.059]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.062]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[00:12:17.442 --> 00:12:22.985]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:12:23.065 --> 00:12:32.849]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[00:12:33.109 --> 00:12:39.352]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[00:12:39.593 --> 00:12:42.914]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[00:12:42.954 --> 00:12:44.775]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[00:12:44.995 --> 00:12:46.876]  It simply needs some help so it has
[00:12:48.117 --> 00:12:50.259]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:05.623]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:06.124 --> 00:13:13.149]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:19.895]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:22.117]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:22.257 --> 00:13:24.679]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:28.762]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists,
[00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:34.525]  Who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs.
[00:13:34.966 --> 00:13:35.686]  That's fascism.
[00:13:36.327 --> 00:13:37.627]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:38.008 --> 00:13:39.388]  It's about a one world government.
[00:13:39.869 --> 00:13:46.193]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:13:55.038 --> 00:13:56.179]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:56.599 --> 00:13:57.800]  The people strike back.
[00:13:59.707 --> 00:14:01.248]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:14:01.408 --> 00:14:01.728]  October 6, 2009.
[00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:02.609]  Gold opened this morning at $10.29.70.
[00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:05.850]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $10.58.45, $5.29.23 for the half-ounce, or $2.64.61 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:06.471]  That's $10.58.45, $5.29.23, or $2.64.61.
[00:14:18.516 --> 00:14:29.103]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:32.446]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:14:32.546 --> 00:14:35.948]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:38.870]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.812]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:14:41.892 --> 00:14:42.192]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:54.221]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:15:00.228 --> 00:15:07.269]  Attention landscapers, house painters, carpet cleaners, pet sitters, gutter cleaners, and anyone who has their own home service business.
[00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:10.730]  Would you love to build a huge and loyal customer base fast?

[00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:14.723]  We're going to be getting into the drumbeat to abolish the dollar and replace it with something even worse.
[00:16:16.578 --> 00:16:18.720]  What that's going to mean to this nation is not pretty.
[00:16:22.364 --> 00:16:25.266]  This is much worse than any foreign military power could do to us.
[00:16:25.286 --> 00:16:32.774]  We're going to get more into the flu, going to get into what's happening with these fusion centers, open announcing
[00:16:34.082 --> 00:16:36.543]  Open announcement by the President of the Federalization of Society.
[00:16:36.583 --> 00:16:42.084]  But going back to Mike Rivero, Mike, you got cut off by the break getting into Iran.
[00:16:42.184 --> 00:16:43.384]  I had Ray McGovern on last week.
[00:16:43.404 --> 00:16:45.925]  He agreed with your analysis, the comments I've had.
[00:16:46.525 --> 00:16:47.505]  It was a total hoax.
[00:16:48.065 --> 00:16:50.166]  Iran is always building these enrichment centers.
[00:16:50.186 --> 00:16:51.066]  They have a whole bunch of them.
[00:16:51.586 --> 00:16:52.586]  The site was known.
[00:16:52.646 --> 00:16:54.087]  They're getting ready to open it in a few months.
[00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:58.928]  They said, here is a site that gets enrichment up to about 85 percent, non-weapons grade.
[00:16:59.468 --> 00:17:01.550]  We'd like you to come inspect and set up stuff here.
[00:17:02.051 --> 00:17:04.854]  And the media hoaxed it here and said, we found a secret base!
[00:17:05.114 --> 00:17:08.218]  We found... And then the next day, oh well, they told us about it sneakily!
[00:17:08.238 --> 00:17:11.481]  I mean, that's the contempt the media has for us.
[00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:12.702]  It was all a big hoax.
[00:17:14.008 --> 00:17:20.832]  Well, first of all, the enrichment for fuel rods is only 5%, not 85%, and that's what Iran is basically working on.
[00:17:21.593 --> 00:17:29.498]  And the idea was, as I said, the reason for this incredible explosion of anti-Iran propaganda was to distract the rest of the world from the fact
[00:17:29.898 --> 00:17:46.293]  That Iran was playing by the rules of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which it is a signer, and it was playing by the rules set down by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and only the week before, the United Nations had asked Israel to sign the NNPT and submit to inspections, and Israel said, absolutely not.
[00:17:46.853 --> 00:17:53.816]  Last spring, the United States asked Israel to sign the NNPT and submit to inspections and Israel said no.
[00:17:53.836 --> 00:17:59.999]  Do you remember Barack Obama's first press conference as President and Helen Thomas asked him that direct question?
[00:18:00.699 --> 00:18:04.081]  What countries in the Middle East today have nuclear weapons?
[00:18:04.161 --> 00:18:06.762]  And Barack Obama put on his tap shoes and he tap danced away.
[00:18:07.362 --> 00:18:07.943]  We're good to go.
[00:18:25.031 --> 00:18:33.423]  That has nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technology that is not a signer of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or allows IAEA inspections.
[00:18:33.503 --> 00:18:38.330]  In other words, all these billions and billions of dollars our government keeps giving to Israel is illegal!
[00:18:39.269 --> 00:18:45.093]  if Israel has nuclear weapons and so there's this sort of a secret nudge nudge wink wink understanding between the U.S.
[00:18:45.133 --> 00:18:46.414]  and Israel where the U.S.
[00:18:46.434 --> 00:18:52.998]  will always pretend not to know that Israel is a nuclear power so they can go on looting money from the taxpayers and sending it to Israel.
[00:18:53.198 --> 00:19:00.783]  Now saying that Israel can't protect themselves, I want to continue your comment there but I want to go back to this enrichment issue.
[00:19:00.843 --> 00:19:06.386]  I'm not a nuclear engineer like Bob Bowman or somebody but I want to be clear from what I've read in the press or if you're saying this is false.
[00:19:07.227 --> 00:19:08.368]  Ninety-five percent
[00:19:09.389 --> 00:19:14.371]  Centrifugal enrichment is what they need for an A-bomb, for weapons grade.
[00:19:14.732 --> 00:19:20.974]  Now, the debate is, they've said you don't need a high percentage for regular fuel rods.
[00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:25.557]  Why can some of your centrifuges get up to 84, 85, 86 percent?
[00:19:25.897 --> 00:19:27.597]  The point is, it still won't make a bomb.
[00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:32.560]  My point is, they do have centrifuges, I believe Iran's admitted this, up to 80-something percent.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.142]  But the point is, it's nowhere near the 95.
[00:19:35.202 --> 00:19:42.127]  Getting that other 10% is very, very hard to do compared to what you're saying about them only needing 5% for fuel rods.
[00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:43.968]  Well, then the question is, why do they need that?
[00:19:44.228 --> 00:19:45.469]  Then the other debate comes in.
[00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.932]  They're many years away from a primitive A-bomb, no delivery system.
[00:19:48.952 --> 00:19:49.432]  The U.S.
[00:19:49.873 --> 00:19:53.695]  and England helped give Pakistan nukes and delivery systems.
[00:19:54.096 --> 00:19:55.917]  Israel has 400 or more nukes.
[00:19:56.297 --> 00:19:57.918]  They have high-tech delivery systems.
[00:19:58.019 --> 00:19:59.680]  Why is everybody picking on Iran?
[00:20:00.919 --> 00:20:07.321]  Well, everybody's picking on Iran because if you look through the newspapers over the last several years, Israel is the one saying, please go pick on Iran.
[00:20:07.341 --> 00:20:08.201]  We're afraid of Iran.
[00:20:08.241 --> 00:20:08.981]  Iran hates us.
[00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:11.402]  Ahmadinejad wants to wipe Israel off the map.
[00:20:11.662 --> 00:20:16.183]  It's the same kind of propaganda campaign we saw leading into the attack on Iraq.
[00:20:16.543 --> 00:20:17.764]  Israel says, go kill them.
[00:20:17.784 --> 00:20:18.124]  The U.S.
[00:20:18.144 --> 00:20:20.445]  government says, yes, master, I must go kill.
[00:20:20.745 --> 00:20:21.765]  And the American kids,
[00:20:22.185 --> 00:20:22.806]  We're good to go.
[00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:41.564]  Because the U.S.
[00:20:41.584 --> 00:20:47.852]  doesn't have anything to sell, we're using our threat of war to keep other countries to go along propping up U.S.
[00:20:47.932 --> 00:20:48.192]  debt.
[00:20:48.232 --> 00:20:55.841]  Now the other aspect, and the reason they're pushing for yet another war in this huge mess of wars we've already got going, if you go back and you look at history,
[00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:56.582]  The U.S.
[00:20:56.622 --> 00:21:02.388]  got out of the crash of 1904 by getting into World War I. They got out of the crash of 1929 by getting into World War II.
[00:21:02.788 --> 00:21:11.257]  Now we're in the crash of 2007, and it's not a coincidence our government is trying to create a major war to distract us all from the fact that the U.S.
[00:21:11.377 --> 00:21:14.160]  government is what screwed up the economy and this country.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.882]  And by the way, that's not your opinion.
[00:21:15.922 --> 00:21:25.152]  The Rand Corporation a year ago said, we need a giant, multi-theater war on the scale of World War II to bring in the New World Order.
[00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:31.839]  And they need that political diversion, or stage terror, or a swine flu pandemic, or all three of them combined.
[00:21:33.015 --> 00:21:35.517]  We're entering the danger zone right now.
[00:21:35.617 --> 00:21:38.799]  Mike Rivera, let's continue to talk about that on the other side.
[00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:48.927]  Then I want to get into the media saying it's the Arabs that are going to kill the dollar, when it's our own G20, our own Geithner, saying they're open to moving away from the dollar.
[00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:51.189]  We're on the march.
[00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:53.270]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.211 --> 00:21:56.873]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.097 --> 00:22:02.699]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:22:03.099 --> 00:22:08.063]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:22:08.443 --> 00:22:10.164]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:22:10.485 --> 00:22:15.308]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:22:15.488 --> 00:22:16.429]  How much do you want?
[00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:17.410]  When do you want it?
[00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.391]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:20.512]  When will you need it?
[00:22:20.752 --> 00:22:22.814]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:22:22.954 --> 00:22:24.075]  Will there be any food?
[00:22:24.295 --> 00:22:25.616]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:22:25.816 --> 00:22:30.878]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:22:31.078 --> 00:22:34.300]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.162]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:39.462]  How much will you need?
[00:22:39.702 --> 00:22:40.303]  We don't know.
[00:22:40.603 --> 00:22:41.523]  How much do you want?
[00:22:41.723 --> 00:22:42.444]  All you can get.
[00:22:42.644 --> 00:22:43.324]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:43.724 --> 00:22:43.944]  I think.
[00:22:59.099 --> 00:23:04.285]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:23:04.405 --> 00:23:08.770]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.792]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:11.213 --> 00:23:12.554]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:12.835 --> 00:23:13.876]  There is a solution.
[00:23:14.096 --> 00:23:22.121]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:23:22.521 --> 00:23:29.605]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:41.592]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:04.574]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[00:24:04.954 --> 00:24:05.354]  I'm not.
[00:24:05.474 --> 00:24:06.134]  Don't trust it.
[00:24:06.214 --> 00:24:08.075]  But then I don't want to get the disease either.
[00:24:08.435 --> 00:24:13.896]  So I use Pure Works, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[00:24:14.156 --> 00:24:16.616]  Pure Works is not your typical hand disinfectant.

[00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.332]  Look, we have a corrupt elite who aren't going to turn loose.
[00:25:45.392 --> 00:25:46.993]  They're not going to stop what they're doing.
[00:25:47.233 --> 00:25:48.113]  They're not going to quit.
[00:25:48.153 --> 00:26:00.960]  And as long as we debate Barack Obama and George Bush and the new Mitt Romney, who's probably going to be the next Republican nominee, and, oh, he's a Mormon, he isn't, oh, look at Brett Favre.
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.141]  You know, he beat his old team yesterday.
[00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:06.463]  Look at, look at all the people extorting David Letterman.
[00:26:08.925 --> 00:26:09.806]  All these other people.
[00:26:10.006 --> 00:26:11.107]  It doesn't matter.
[00:26:11.388 --> 00:26:12.409]  It's all theater.
[00:26:12.809 --> 00:26:17.354]  Obama is continuing the exact same policies on every point of Bush.
[00:26:17.634 --> 00:26:18.455]  Just different rhetoric.
[00:26:20.938 --> 00:26:24.021]  And things are only going to get worse and worse until we turn around and stop this.
[00:26:24.322 --> 00:26:30.909]  Coming up in about 10 minutes, I'm going to play for the world premiere of the new Fall of the Republic trailer.
[00:26:32.517 --> 00:26:36.981]  We're going to play it live here on air coming up in about 10 minutes and we're going to be taking your calls.
[00:26:37.361 --> 00:26:39.143]  Going back to Mike Rivera.
[00:26:41.645 --> 00:26:47.570]  Mike, looking at the end of the dollar, I saw the headlines in the London Telegraph today.
[00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:48.871]  The Independent also reported it.
[00:26:48.911 --> 00:26:51.253]  The demise of the dollar are the headlines.
[00:26:54.178 --> 00:27:00.263]  Says oil states are plotting, but we have the G20, we have Russia, we have China, we have the United States.
[00:27:00.323 --> 00:27:03.485]  Geithner's saying, yeah, we're going to SDRs, bank to bank.
[00:27:04.106 --> 00:27:09.030]  We'll still have our regional currencies, it's just going to be global digital transfers where the banks
[00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:17.735]  Don't just have countries back up new debts they create and that they then loan, but that now the banks will just issue debt themselves.
[00:27:18.116 --> 00:27:20.257]  They've always done that through fractional reserve banking.
[00:27:20.677 --> 00:27:25.320]  Now they're just removing the final links and then they're going to make us back up their Ponzi schemes.
[00:27:26.281 --> 00:27:28.282]  And so how do you see them killing the dollar?
[00:27:28.343 --> 00:27:34.347]  I mean, this continual drumbeat of kill the dollar, kill the dollar, kill the dollar, kill the dollar, kill the dollar.
[00:27:34.807 --> 00:27:41.632]  And then I'm seeing product placement in ads for soft drinks about keep the dollar, dump the euro.
[00:27:42.012 --> 00:27:43.773]  So there's definitely a big fight going on.
[00:27:44.013 --> 00:27:45.694]  From your research, who are the players?
[00:27:46.135 --> 00:27:47.095]  I want your perspective.
[00:27:47.155 --> 00:27:47.976]  What's going on?
[00:27:48.536 --> 00:27:50.378]  What's the larger picture in all of this?
[00:27:51.259 --> 00:27:58.798]  And do you see this being a slow death of the dollar, phasing us into this new global bank, where the banks openly become the world government?
[00:28:00.194 --> 00:28:11.663]  Well, it's a complex issue, and first of all, Saudi Arabia has already gone public saying that this story about this plot between the oil companies in Russia and the oil countries and Russia and China does not exist.
[00:28:11.723 --> 00:28:20.210]  Now, that doesn't necessarily mean it's so, but the dollar took a major beating, and obviously those countries still holding a lot of dollar reserves don't want that to happen.
[00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.132]  So there's a big deny-he-said-she-said going on.
[00:28:23.552 --> 00:28:25.554]  I tend to go with trusting Robert Fisk.
[00:28:25.574 --> 00:28:29.197]  He's got a good record for accuracy as to what's going on.
[00:28:29.637 --> 00:28:34.459]  As for the dollar, it's been dying a slow death ever since 1913, without question.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:51.128]  And the problem I have is this whole reserve interest-bearing banking system ultimately is doomed to crash after crash after crash because the instant that first debt-based note goes into circulation, more money is owed to the banking system than is actually in existence.
[00:28:51.468 --> 00:28:54.291]  When everybody talks about all this huge government debt the U.S.
[00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:59.255]  owes and all the debt the American people owes, it's not money that ever really existed.
[00:28:59.395 --> 00:29:06.402]  It is the accumulated compound interest over decade after decade of reckless spending by the U.S.
[00:29:06.462 --> 00:29:06.842]  government.
[00:29:06.883 --> 00:29:09.205]  And of course, the Federal Reserve is a private bank.
[00:29:09.505 --> 00:29:11.207]  It's no more federal than Federal Express.
[00:29:11.747 --> 00:29:12.928]  They encourage this.
[00:29:13.008 --> 00:29:15.870]  They encourage paying only the interest and never the principal.
[00:29:16.191 --> 00:29:22.596]  They support congressional campaigns for those candidates who will go on supporting this financial enslavement system.
[00:29:23.036 --> 00:29:30.002]  And so the problem is we've reached the point where nobody trusts the dollar anymore because it has to inflate just to cover its own indebtedness.
[00:29:30.362 --> 00:29:34.646]  And this is why we're seeing other countries start to very slowly and quietly get out of their dollar positions.
[00:29:35.066 --> 00:29:38.589]  Nobody wants to do something that will trigger a panic, because that will hurt everybody.
[00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:46.236]  But once all the other countries are out of their dollar positions, then the rug is going to get pulled out from under it, because there'll be nothing left to support it.
[00:29:46.556 --> 00:30:00.089]  In addition to this story that we had about the oil nations wanting to get out of the dollar, we're hearing all this talk about switching the reserve currency of the world away from the dollar, sort of undoing the last of the Bretton Woods Agreement, and without those two factors,
[00:30:00.469 --> 00:30:03.130]  Creating artificial international demand for the dollars.
[00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:04.370]  Who would want them?
[00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:04.930]  The U.S.
[00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.831]  doesn't make anything anybody else wants to buy anymore.
[00:30:08.051 --> 00:30:10.011]  We're no longer an agricultural giant.
[00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:11.431]  We've lost our industry.
[00:30:11.491 --> 00:30:12.691]  We've lost our high-tech.
[00:30:13.052 --> 00:30:14.332]  This nation has been looted.
[00:30:14.352 --> 00:30:19.453]  There's a TV show on the History Channel just today, The Crumbling of America, showing how the U.S.
[00:30:19.513 --> 00:30:26.774]  federal government has absolutely neglected the infrastructure of this country for decades, and it's literally falling apart.
[00:30:26.814 --> 00:30:29.575]  We're dissolving into a third world nation right before our eyes.
[00:30:31.687 --> 00:30:32.748]  And that's the plan.
[00:30:32.788 --> 00:30:54.805]  You go back to Maurice Strong, we cover this in my film Fall of the Republic, they openly wrote and stated at the United Nations Rio de Janeiro 92 meeting on population, they said we're going to destroy society, destroy industry to save the earth, we're going to create a debt system where the average person, even if they're hard-working, can't get credit or can't get enough of a job to be able to have more than one child.
[00:30:55.586 --> 00:31:03.129]  We're going to have a social welfare system that bans any type of family support, that bans neighborhoods keeping each other's kids.
[00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:04.490]  That's now happening worldwide.
[00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:08.072]  It's global implementation of the new global corporate state.
[00:31:08.472 --> 00:31:12.614]  They want us totally dependent on them so they can then social engineer us.
[00:31:12.654 --> 00:31:13.414]  They're psychopaths.
[00:31:13.694 --> 00:31:14.454]  They're control freaks.
[00:31:14.494 --> 00:31:20.137]  They want us chained down in the barn so they can get the blowtorch and pliers out.
[00:31:20.597 --> 00:31:23.579]  That's what this control freak religion is all about.
[00:31:24.699 --> 00:31:26.780]  You know, they keep explaining on the news today.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.641]  I was watching CNBC for 20 minutes.
[00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:31.062]  They were saying, look, it's a new economy.
[00:31:31.182 --> 00:31:35.064]  We have a 10% unemployment and this is a good economy.
[00:31:35.124 --> 00:31:36.705]  And there's going to be more unemployed.
[00:31:37.225 --> 00:31:40.027]  And as long as the banks are making money, our economy is doing good.
[00:31:40.327 --> 00:31:43.468]  So we now have a jobless recovery oxymoron.
[00:31:43.709 --> 00:31:45.570]  Talk about that, Mike, from your perspective.
[00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:56.654]  Yeah, basically the health of the economy is being defined solely in terms of the corporations, which so far are surviving on taxpayer bailouts.
[00:31:57.274 --> 00:32:03.397]  And we are literally in a fascist economy where the wealth is being moved from the working and middle classes to the ultra-rich
[00:32:03.737 --> 00:32:05.078]  Profits are kept private.
[00:32:05.318 --> 00:32:06.439]  Losses are socialized.
[00:32:06.479 --> 00:32:09.061]  That is the hallmark of a fascist economy.
[00:32:09.402 --> 00:32:23.073]  And the bottom line is if anybody wants to know what life is going to be like under this new corporate state, all you have to do is look back in history at the abuses of the company towns that we used to see out in the mining communities and the railroad camps and how horribly oppressive they were.
[00:32:23.353 --> 00:32:25.795]  That is exactly what is in store for all of us.
[00:32:26.095 --> 00:32:30.859]  Now, we keep hearing all this stuff about how global government is going to be good and it's going to be wonderful, means the end of war.
[00:32:31.239 --> 00:32:31.819]  I'm sorry.
[00:32:31.879 --> 00:32:34.101]  Global government is what Alexander the Great wanted.
[00:32:34.481 --> 00:32:36.102]  It was what the Roman Caesars wanted.
[00:32:36.303 --> 00:32:37.524]  It was what Napoleon wanted.
[00:32:37.724 --> 00:32:38.704]  It was what Hitler wanted.
[00:32:38.905 --> 00:32:41.987]  And it brought more war and more death and more deprivation.
[00:32:42.347 --> 00:32:47.612]  And even after they got something approaching global government, it was a disaster for everybody.
[00:32:47.652 --> 00:32:55.539]  When Alexander the Great died, he deliberately shattered his empire to create new civil wars so that nobody else would ever be his equal in history.
[00:32:55.799 --> 00:32:58.161]  That's the kind of insanity that we see in the leadership.
[00:32:58.581 --> 00:32:59.262]  Every century,
[00:32:59.642 --> 00:33:15.889]  Planet Earth is cursed with a person or a group of people who think they have a right to control it all and they want to stand up on top of a pyramid built to their own vanity and scream, I am king of the world and it doesn't matter how much poverty and disease and starvation and privation and death they bring to the rest of the world to do it.
[00:33:16.277 --> 00:33:18.638]  Yeah, it's Yertle the Turtle, in fact, going back to that.
[00:33:19.138 --> 00:33:29.982]  Big government is global tyranny, and global government is worldwide straitjacket, nowhere to run, and that's why they want global standardization, the OECD, the IMF and World Bank all brag.
[00:33:30.322 --> 00:33:38.845]  That's what world government is, is a private group of bankers running your carbon footprint, taxing, tracking everything you do, taxing energy,
[00:33:39.565 --> 00:33:53.932]  Taxing money transfers and bankrupting things and reengineering the economy where you can only get a scholarship to be a cop or only be a scholarship to be a secret agent or only get a scholarship to data mine and surveil people.
[00:33:54.432 --> 00:34:00.075]  And so you've got all these people with degrees who rationalize what they're doing because that's their degree.
[00:34:00.595 --> 00:34:01.476]  That's who they are.
[00:34:02.512 --> 00:34:03.393]  And what they are.
[00:34:04.313 --> 00:34:07.935]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[00:34:08.136 --> 00:34:15.600]  And now, as they engineer the crisis, they then pose as the saviors for the next leg of the solution.
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:22.464]  I want to go to a video clip now for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and an audio clip for the radio listeners.
[00:34:22.805 --> 00:34:25.226]  This is going to be going up at FallTheRepublic.com.
[00:34:26.812 --> 00:34:32.574]  You want to see it in the highest quality, in members quality, in PrisonPlanet.tv members quality.
[00:34:32.834 --> 00:34:35.776]  It's in the members medium quality, because it's not super high quality.
[00:34:35.796 --> 00:34:38.317]  A lot of folks don't have connections to download or stream.
[00:34:39.057 --> 00:34:43.579]  But this is going out in the next 20-30 minutes at FallTheRepublic.com.
[00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:46.760]  But here it is, premiered on the radio.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.761]  This is the second major trailer.
[00:34:49.301 --> 00:34:50.461]  Rob Jacobson did this one.
[00:34:50.881 --> 00:34:54.383]  Another one's coming out tomorrow on the mind control angle in the film.
[00:34:55.163 --> 00:35:10.614]  This is kind of a general trailer for Fall of the Republic that you can pre-order now and then that means it'll be shipped out in the order it's received on or before October 21st on DVD in the highest quality and of course premiering at PrisonPlanet.TV as well.
[00:35:10.974 --> 00:35:15.357]  Here is the latest trailer, trailer number two for Fall of the Republic.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.022]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:27.145]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:35:28.186 --> 00:35:32.968]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:35:32.988 --> 00:35:39.311]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:35:41.031 --> 00:35:46.034]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[00:35:46.254 --> 00:35:51.236]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:35:53.095 --> 00:35:57.376]  One of the greatest events in history is taking place before our very eyes.
[00:35:57.396 --> 00:36:06.258]  If I have a question for this young man, he has the right to be represented!
[00:36:06.458 --> 00:36:17.521]  It's up to every man, woman, and child in the United States to decide whether we're going to be fooled by the slick propaganda of the social engineers, or whether we're going to restore the republic.
[00:36:18.683 --> 00:36:23.025]  We have seen this erosion to the point where today it seems like nobody does care.
[00:36:23.705 --> 00:36:28.447]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:36:33.449 --> 00:36:35.409]  Who's gonna soak up the derivatives?
[00:36:35.469 --> 00:36:37.010]  Who's gonna soak up the debt?
[00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:38.310]  Who's gonna be penalized?
[00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:47.314]  Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[00:36:49.032 --> 00:36:49.472]  I don't know.
[00:36:49.492 --> 00:36:55.816]  Do you think it's consistent with the spirit of that revision of the Constitution to hand out a half a trillion dollars to foreigners?
[00:36:56.396 --> 00:36:59.197]  Will we choose liberty or will we choose tyranny?
[00:36:59.538 --> 00:37:01.699]  The Republic is hanging by a thread.
[00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:04.900]  You don't have a president, you have an actor.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.441]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:37:07.682 --> 00:37:09.002]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:37:09.603 --> 00:37:11.864]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:37:11.984 --> 00:37:13.204]  Who do we sell these matches to?
[00:37:13.885 --> 00:37:18.167]  The last vestiges of our free system of government are being swept away.
[00:37:19.778 --> 00:37:21.118]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:23.079]  Volume 1.
[00:37:23.939 --> 00:37:25.679]  The Presidency of Barack Obama.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:32.881]  Available on DVD at InfoWars.com and online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:33.701 --> 00:37:36.322]  The destiny of humanity is in our hands.
[00:37:37.742 --> 00:37:38.203]  October 21st, 2009.
[00:37:47.754 --> 00:38:03.873]  Okay, and that's going up at followtherepublic.com right now and at prisonplanet.tv and of course in the next few hours at the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube if you wish to watch it again or for radio listeners who aren't watching prisonplanet.tv right now.
[00:38:05.187 --> 00:38:07.748]  Is this the fall of our republic, Mike Rivero?
[00:38:08.148 --> 00:38:12.390]  I mean, I think we should be honest that for all intents and purposes, they're killing the dollar.
[00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.550]  That kills the empire.
[00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:18.051]  The country's already broke back over funding the empire, because it's not our empire.
[00:38:18.091 --> 00:38:19.272]  It's a private banking empire.
[00:38:19.492 --> 00:38:20.452]  They're done with us now.
[00:38:20.492 --> 00:38:21.973]  They've kind of maxed out our credit card.
[00:38:22.513 --> 00:38:28.735]  And then if we don't come to grips with the fact that if we don't have the Bill of Rights and Constitution, we're just more real estate, more conquered dirt.
[00:38:29.395 --> 00:38:34.420]  And that by admitting we've seen the fall of our republic, then we can set about getting our country back.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.202]  Or, do you disagree with that statement?
[00:38:37.228 --> 00:38:47.392]  I would say we're at the point right now where we need to start seriously thinking about what we're going to build in the wake of the United States of America, because I don't see this country being able to last much longer.
[00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:49.953]  I think, much like the USSR, the U.S.
[00:38:50.013 --> 00:38:51.253]  government is going to collapse.
[00:38:51.313 --> 00:39:04.298]  Now, into that vacuum, a lot of opportunists are going to come in, trying to sell us a one-world government or some other ready-made, plug-in, ready-to-rock-and-roll government, and I think we need to be aware of that with the buckets of tar and sacks of feathers.
[00:39:04.579 --> 00:39:05.699]  You're absolutely right, it's already happening.
[00:39:06.693 --> 00:39:24.584]  So, you know, I think we, the American people, have got to start sitting down and say, OK, if we're going to have a chance to create a whole new country, it is up to us to decide what it's going to be and to make sure that it's taking care of we, the people, and not just another group of rich opportunists coming in and treating the American people like we're just a bunch of herd animals.
[00:39:24.925 --> 00:39:34.811]  Now, I don't know if you're seeing these LRADs and these microwave pain guns they're starting to give out to the police forces, but frankly, that's just the modern equivalent of flogging the slaves back to the slave pens.
[00:39:35.071 --> 00:39:37.112]  Exactly, Mike, I wanted to ask you about that.
[00:39:37.252 --> 00:39:51.482]  These federal fusion centers going in, even in small counties, Obama now admits that's for the patriots, the gun owners, the libertarians, the leftists, anybody that doesn't go along with mainline, drink your fluoride, inject your kids, worship global government.
[00:39:52.242 --> 00:40:00.425]  Uh, for anybody that's got two brain cells rubbed together, they're now deploying LRADs through Homeland Security saying that's what NORTHCOM's for!
[00:40:00.665 --> 00:40:07.688]  They're admitting this is a giant black ski mask, no protest allowed in D.C., no protest allowed in G20.
[00:40:08.088 --> 00:40:10.329]  I mean, this is, this is Communist China.
[00:40:10.409 --> 00:40:12.570]  I mean, this is hellishly illegal.
[00:40:13.407 --> 00:40:15.788]  They're declaring war on the American people.
[00:40:16.488 --> 00:40:18.769]  We are now at war with our own government.
[00:40:18.889 --> 00:40:27.972]  The government has started the war, and I want to be very careful about this, because I don't support and encourage violence, because the first side that starts shooting will be seen as the bad guys.
[00:40:28.052 --> 00:40:29.072]  And that's why they're losing!
[00:40:29.372 --> 00:40:36.460]  Because they're beating old women, they're having police dogs attack them, they're being caught provocateuring to make it look like we're throwing stuff first.
[00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:37.942]  You're absolutely right.
[00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:39.764]  Mike, do you agree with me?
[00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:44.970]  They're losing the PR battle big time, but they're so arrogant, their humorous is carrying them through?
[00:40:45.811 --> 00:40:47.072]  That's exactly right.
[00:40:47.172 --> 00:40:50.453]  What we're dealing with here is Rivero's Law of Mid-Management.
[00:40:50.813 --> 00:40:57.697]  We have got all these super elites, most of whom are Cold War fossils who grew up in an age where the government could say and do anything and get away with it.
[00:40:58.017 --> 00:41:01.718]  And they're sitting on top of all these mid-level bureaucrats who want to keep their jobs.
[00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:05.000]  And so these mid-level bureaucrats are saying, oh yes, it's all working.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:05.920]  They believe you.
[00:41:06.121 --> 00:41:07.721]  They still love the political leadership.
[00:41:07.941 --> 00:41:09.442]  They're ready to go to war.
[00:41:09.482 --> 00:41:10.643]  They're ready to die for Israel.
[00:41:10.663 --> 00:41:12.724]  And they're ready to give you more of their money and their children.
[00:41:13.764 --> 00:41:21.107]  Our top leadership is very much out of touch with what's going on in Main Street America, and in that lies the eventual collapse of the U.S.
[00:41:21.167 --> 00:41:21.467]  government.
[00:41:21.647 --> 00:41:23.888]  They don't know what's really going on out here.
[00:41:24.088 --> 00:41:31.031]  They're being kept blind deliberately by their own staffers and aides who don't want to lose their jobs for having messed it up this bad.
[00:41:31.371 --> 00:41:32.372]  Well, that always happens.
[00:41:32.412 --> 00:41:42.196]  With Hitler, up until the day before he blew his head off in the bunker, if you believe that official story, the point is, they really thought they were going to win the war up until 24 hours before.
[00:41:42.236 --> 00:41:43.036]  They were delusional.
[00:41:43.926 --> 00:41:45.928]  And I see this more and more.
[00:41:46.009 --> 00:41:47.050]  I mean, the worm has turned.
[00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:48.111]  I know we're going to win.
[00:41:48.391 --> 00:41:53.217]  It's just going to be hellish and bloody and painful, and I would rather not go that route.
[00:41:54.037 --> 00:41:57.802]  But power corrupts, and the establishment just thinks they're invincible.
[00:41:57.842 --> 00:42:02.847]  And you're right that history shows that they're just repeating the same thing.
[00:42:03.067 --> 00:42:04.869]  So how do you see this shaking out, Mike?
[00:42:05.985 --> 00:42:07.846]  I am absolutely convinced that the U.S.
[00:42:07.866 --> 00:42:10.507]  government is going to collapse in the manner of the U.S.S.R.
[00:42:10.587 --> 00:42:15.469]  and we need to study what the Russians did that worked and what the Russians did that did not work.
[00:42:15.509 --> 00:42:16.830]  We need to avoid their mistakes.
[00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:22.873]  We need to go through our own equivalent of kicking out the oligarchs and putting our nation back on a solid financial track.
[00:42:22.893 --> 00:42:30.636]  I mean, look how quickly Putin managed to pay off Russia's debt once they had a working economy that wasn't burdened with centuries of reckless debt.
[00:42:30.656 --> 00:42:31.577]  And let's get this straight.
[00:42:31.597 --> 00:42:32.597]  He's not perfect.
[00:42:32.677 --> 00:42:33.497]  I mean, we're certainly not.
[00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:35.919]  Exactly.
[00:42:35.959 --> 00:42:40.463]  If we debate liberal-conservative, nothing's ever gonna... You must kick the bankers out.
[00:42:40.503 --> 00:42:41.484]  You must arrest them.
[00:42:41.765 --> 00:42:42.705]  They're the real government.
[00:42:42.725 --> 00:42:43.646]  You must end the Fed.
[00:42:44.447 --> 00:42:46.669]  Anything else is cosmetic, and that's... Stay there, Mike.
[00:42:46.689 --> 00:42:48.111]  I want to get your take on that when we get back.
[00:42:48.411 --> 00:42:51.434]  Two more seconds with Mike Rivero, jamming a few of your phone calls.
[00:42:51.474 --> 00:42:54.777]  We got the Camp FEMA folks coming up with big developments on that front.
[00:42:55.277 --> 00:42:55.738]  Stay with us.
[00:43:00.066 --> 00:43:06.591]  eCigarettesNational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.

[00:44:02.065 --> 00:44:04.466]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:44:04.486 --> 00:44:07.067]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:44:07.087 --> 00:44:08.288]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:44:08.308 --> 00:44:09.948]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:44:10.029 --> 00:44:12.830]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:16.551]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[00:44:26.204 --> 00:44:31.490]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:44:32.351 --> 00:44:33.452]  An inside job.
[00:44:34.858 --> 00:44:38.681]  How dare you?
[00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:42.364]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:44:42.384 --> 00:44:45.006]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:44:45.086 --> 00:44:51.691]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:44:56.855 --> 00:44:59.337]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:45:00.129 --> 00:45:03.871]  Berkey water systems are the most trusted name in water filtration available on the market.

[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:25.985]  But they also reduce nitrates, nitrites, sediment, and unhealthy minerals such as lead and mercury.

[00:45:52.206 --> 00:45:53.166]  Day after day, alone on a hill,
[00:46:10.249 --> 00:46:19.358]  Mike, I want to take some calls in the couple of segments we've got left with you.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.603]  But just briefly going back to the flu.
[00:46:28.331 --> 00:46:29.393]  I mean, we know it's a fraud.
[00:46:29.433 --> 00:46:30.434]  We know it's a moneymaker.
[00:46:30.474 --> 00:46:33.378]  We know the UN's using it as a way to test global government.
[00:46:33.398 --> 00:46:43.291]  They bragged and said that the whole world under UN command on the flu response to the level 6 that they issue when it's not even really a level 6 with the number of cases or deaths.
[00:46:44.565 --> 00:46:46.347]  What do you think the overall motive?
[00:46:46.667 --> 00:46:48.589]  Was it just profit and power grab?
[00:46:49.129 --> 00:46:55.515]  Or do you think, in your spidey sense, they're planning to really go wild with this and really release something more deadly?
[00:46:55.555 --> 00:46:59.219]  Or do they know the nasal spray live virus is going to mutate?
[00:46:59.239 --> 00:47:02.702]  They say they know it is, but do they know it's going to mutate into something really bad?
[00:47:02.742 --> 00:47:05.505]  I mean, there are a bunch of eugenicists that say they want to kill us.
[00:47:05.965 --> 00:47:07.507]  Could this be their global crisis?
[00:47:07.627 --> 00:47:08.688]  100 million people dead?
[00:47:09.861 --> 00:47:15.246]  Well, I think they're definitely trying to create a global crisis in order to justify the bringing on of global government.
[00:47:15.286 --> 00:47:18.489]  They wanted to do that with global warming, human-caused global warming.
[00:47:18.909 --> 00:47:23.393]  The idea being that if there was a global environmental crisis, it had to have a global controlling authority.
[00:47:23.873 --> 00:47:33.782]  That one fell flat on its face because the Earth is actually getting cooler and the scientific underpinnings of human-caused global warming have basically all been destroyed over the last couple of years.
[00:47:34.242 --> 00:47:36.363]  So, okay, global warming isn't going to work.
[00:47:36.403 --> 00:47:37.863]  Let's come up with a new crisis.
[00:47:38.203 --> 00:47:40.084]  It's the Hegelian dialectic all over again.
[00:47:40.104 --> 00:47:48.087]  They're looking to create a global crisis of some kind that will justify, or at least sell to the people of the world, the necessity for a global government.
[00:47:48.327 --> 00:47:57.050]  Whether it's a global economic crash, a global flu pandemic, global warming, aliens invading, whatever they think is going to work, that's what they're going to do.
[00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:00.252]  By the way, that's declassified, as you just said, Project Bluebeam.
[00:48:00.552 --> 00:48:07.838]  They don't declassify the details, but they admit they've got a fake alien landing project to unify humanity with big hologram machines if they have to.
[00:48:08.838 --> 00:48:12.801]  But absolutely, they need a global crisis to offer their global solution.
[00:48:13.021 --> 00:48:19.406]  Their latest fear-mongering, I'm sure you saw from the UN, is carbon dioxide is going to make the ocean turn into acid.
[00:48:20.146 --> 00:48:20.587]  Yes!
[00:48:22.264 --> 00:48:27.505]  Well, technically it's already acid because it's carbonic acid, which is the same thing you have in mineral water.
[00:48:28.265 --> 00:48:34.627]  And so, again, they're taking a minor scientific truth and they're blowing it up to be this big scary threat.
[00:48:34.987 --> 00:48:40.448]  But the bottom line is that the Earth is always changing, the climate is always changing, the chemistry is always changing.
[00:48:40.528 --> 00:48:42.549]  It never stays the same.
[00:48:42.609 --> 00:48:48.270]  This idea that if there's a global government that we will lock the Earth in this particular configuration
[00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:52.698]  That some arbitrary definition of what is ideal is absolutely nonsense.
[00:48:52.798 --> 00:48:53.500]  It is artificial.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:53.961]  Exactly.
[00:48:54.001 --> 00:48:55.163]  Let me throw this at you.
[00:48:55.664 --> 00:48:58.790]  I watch on HBO Bill Maher's show sometimes.
[00:48:58.890 --> 00:48:59.752]  They rare it all the time.
[00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:19.376]  Every show he shows the wildfires in LA and says this is global warming, when they've always had wildfires in LA, and now I've talked to the police out there and it's on their news, crazy arsonists go and set fires everywhere, and they have overbuilt out there, and you've got people setting fires.
[00:49:20.456 --> 00:49:24.260]  And then he showed a dust storm in Australia and said it was the end of the world.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.724]  They've always had dust storms out of the interior of Australia.
[00:49:28.784 --> 00:49:33.248]  I mean, these guys will take a tornado, a tsunami, an earthquake.
[00:49:33.588 --> 00:49:34.910]  They're worse than Pat Robertson.
[00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:36.752]  They really are.
[00:49:37.052 --> 00:49:42.738]  Anything that happens, blame it on the villain that we're trying to sell you the solution to, and it's absolutely correct.
[00:49:43.259 --> 00:49:48.945]  And the bottom line, though, is that the Earth is actually cooling, and it's being driven by the Sun.
[00:49:49.285 --> 00:49:55.512]  The actual forces involved in controlling the temperature of the Earth are so far beyond the capabilities of humans to deal with.
[00:49:55.812 --> 00:49:55.932]  Yeah.
[00:49:55.952 --> 00:49:56.032]  Yeah.
[00:50:17.466 --> 00:50:21.309]  Well, you know, the thing is, I know 300 Earths will fit in Jupiter.
[00:50:21.329 --> 00:50:22.489]  Google the term.
[00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:24.531]  How many Earths will fit in the Sun?
[00:50:24.931 --> 00:50:26.292]  You've got this giant fireball.
[00:50:26.312 --> 00:50:27.373]  I think it's several thousand.
[00:50:28.073 --> 00:50:32.736]  You've got this giant fireball that burns your skin if you're out in it too much.
[00:50:32.776 --> 00:50:37.299]  And they're saying, oh, that has nothing to do, the UN officially says, nothing to do with the climate.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:41.242 --> 00:50:43.143]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:50:44.964 --> 00:50:46.666]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:49.582 --> 00:50:53.563]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:50:53.823 --> 00:50:55.603]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:50:55.823 --> 00:51:04.105]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:51:04.345 --> 00:51:09.567]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:51:09.887 --> 00:51:11.527]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:51:11.767 --> 00:51:18.093]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:51:18.273 --> 00:51:29.043]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:51:29.323 --> 00:51:29.843]  That's right.
[00:51:30.104 --> 00:51:32.406]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:51:32.666 --> 00:51:34.247]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[00:51:36.189 --> 00:51:36.649]  Big Brother.
[00:52:05.524 --> 00:52:06.564]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:07.284 --> 00:52:08.385]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:09.045 --> 00:52:09.865]  You want answers?
[00:52:10.625 --> 00:52:11.545]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:12.185 --> 00:52:15.846]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:20.467]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:21.907 --> 00:52:25.267]  I know you can fit 3,000 Earths in Jupiter, so we looked up the number.
[00:52:25.327 --> 00:52:27.468]  It's 1,206,885 Earths will fit inside the Sun.
[00:52:27.488 --> 00:52:27.928]  Gigantic
[00:52:36.405 --> 00:52:39.147]  Hydrogen Thermal Nuclear Explosion Fireball.
[00:52:39.187 --> 00:52:44.650]  It shoots off sunspot eruptions thousands of times the size of the Earth every day.
[00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:51.535]  If you're out there and just the radiation of a solar fail hits you, it'll fry you in your space suit deader than a hammer.
[00:52:52.235 --> 00:52:59.700]  And they get on the news, and I've got it in the official UN documents, and they say the sun has nothing to do with the climate.
[00:53:01.462 --> 00:53:06.710]  And they also tell you polar bears can't swim and show them out on ice flows where they hunt for seals.
[00:53:07.231 --> 00:53:10.056]  Folks, they treat you like you're a complete moron, okay?
[00:53:11.633 --> 00:53:15.074]  There's nothing we can do to affect climate change like the sun.
[00:53:15.634 --> 00:53:20.975]  Carbon dioxide... Mike, have you been seeing the ads on TV saying, watch out, carbon dioxide's deadly poison?
[00:53:21.455 --> 00:53:23.476]  I mean, how dumb do they think the public is?
[00:53:23.936 --> 00:53:32.518]  Well, they apparently think the public are very, very dumb, and the bottom line is that right now the sun is showing hardly any sunspots at all, which means it's actually cooler than normal.
[00:53:32.978 --> 00:53:54.167]  And one thing that we have discovered from all these spacecraft that we've sent to other planets, like we sent Viking to Mars back in 1976, and we've had all these spacecraft out there, and we have documented many, many times that the other planets are heating up and cooling down exactly the same time as Earth is, in the same amounts, and it's obviously the only common factor is the solar radiation here.
[00:53:54.727 --> 00:54:03.474]  Now we already know that when Al Gore did his famous little graph showing Earth's temperature related to carbon dioxide, that he actually got them backward.
[00:54:03.534 --> 00:54:07.938]  That the Earth's temperature went up first, then there was more carbon dioxide.
[00:54:08.218 --> 00:54:12.781]  Because warmer water was giving up its carbon dioxide for the same reason that warm soda pop does.
[00:54:13.282 --> 00:54:15.544]  And as the Earth got warmer, there was more life.
[00:54:15.684 --> 00:54:17.405]  Life produced more carbon dioxide.
[00:54:17.805 --> 00:54:21.909]  So the linkage is actually the reverse of what Al Gore... Now let me stop you for people that don't know.
[00:54:22.677 --> 00:54:38.703]  He knowingly, because all the ice cores, all the climatologists, it's on record that carbon dioxide, because H2O is part CO2, when the earth heats up, then more carbon dioxide comes out, then that accelerates plant life, more oxygen, that's a blooming for the earth.
[00:54:39.184 --> 00:54:42.005]  It's very hard on the earth when it's cold for overall biomass.
[00:54:42.725 --> 00:54:46.310]  They knew all of that and just lied about it.
[00:54:47.331 --> 00:54:53.479]  And just like you leave a Coca-Cola in a can in your hot car, it's going to explode because the CO2 rises in the heat.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:54.941]  Al Gore knows that.
[00:54:55.001 --> 00:54:56.283]  He didn't invent the internet.
[00:54:56.543 --> 00:54:58.486]  He told you NAFTA and GATT were going to be great.
[00:54:58.726 --> 00:54:59.587]  They weren't, were they, Mike?
[00:55:00.308 --> 00:55:01.789]  No, they absolutely weren't.
[00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:13.018]  And just to show you how much, the reason why I think this global warming hype was linked to the push for a global government is look, they gave him the Nobel Peace Prize, they gave him all these film awards to say what a wonderful documentary it was.
[00:55:13.319 --> 00:55:26.690]  It's a hard sell, hard sell, hard sell to sell you the lie that you are to blame for the reason the planet is getting worse and therefore you must submit to global control and global taxation in order to atone for your sins.
[00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.731]  That's what the agenda was there.
[00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:35.354]  And since that's not working out and people aren't falling for the global warming anymore, they're switching over to the swine flu and global financial crisis.
[00:55:35.694 --> 00:55:40.376]  The goal is a global government and they're going to use any excuse they can come up with.
[00:55:41.314 --> 00:55:54.540]  But how can they say, if the sun is obviously the source of most heat on this planet, there's some that comes out of the tectonic plates, the thermal, from the volcanic activity in the core of the Earth, you know, up into the mammal and the crust.
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:59.502]  But I mean, it's just so asinine to say polar bears can't swim and the sun isn't heating us.
[00:55:59.582 --> 00:56:08.586]  I mean, and it's like when I had Rothschild on, I said, the big head environmental land grabber, and I said, but Jupiter and Saturn's moons are melting,
[00:56:10.538 --> 00:56:12.479]  The ice caps of Mars are melting.
[00:56:12.599 --> 00:56:13.640]  This was three years ago.
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:14.380]  Now they're getting bigger.
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:18.762]  And he just said, well, that's because Jupiter, Saturn and Mars are closer to the Sun than the Earth.
[00:56:19.143 --> 00:56:22.004]  And I said, no, it's Mercury and then Venus and then Earth.
[00:56:22.024 --> 00:56:23.945]  He said, no, no, they're closer.
[00:56:24.465 --> 00:56:29.988]  And he just laughed because he knows the he thinks the general audience is like my audience is like the general public.
[00:56:30.268 --> 00:56:34.931]  He thought if he just acted confident and said that Saturn was the closest to the Sun, people believe it.
[00:56:36.513 --> 00:56:45.101]  Well, like I said, these guys grew up in the height of the Cold War where they could lie to the public with impunity and there was no blogosphere or alternative radio to challenge them.
[00:56:46.912 --> 00:56:48.553]  Mike, let me talk to you here in the break.
[00:56:48.573 --> 00:56:50.555]  We've got the Camp FEMA folks coming up.
[00:56:50.575 --> 00:56:51.996]  Mike Rivera, WhatWillHeppen.com.
[00:56:52.036 --> 00:56:55.318]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:55.899 --> 00:56:57.940]  The new film is pre-sale right now.
[00:56:58.441 --> 00:56:59.501]  Ships out on or before the 21st.
[00:56:59.521 --> 00:57:02.303]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:57:02.764 --> 00:57:05.926]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:57:06.386 --> 00:57:10.750]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:12.371]  These emergency backup systems
[00:57:12.551 --> 00:57:15.093]  We'll provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:57:15.493 --> 00:57:21.338]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:57:21.598 --> 00:57:24.660]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:57:25.221 --> 00:57:29.644]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:57:30.044 --> 00:57:36.369]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:57:36.609 --> 00:57:38.551]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:57:39.031 --> 00:57:41.854]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:57:42.235 --> 00:57:46.299]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.522]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:57:48.542 --> 00:57:48.882]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:57:48.902 --> 00:57:48.942]  877-327-0365.
[00:57:48.962 --> 00:57:49.503]  Don't wait.
[00:57:49.523 --> 00:57:49.963]  Call today.
[00:57:59.594 --> 00:58:07.059]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:58:07.339 --> 00:58:13.122]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:58:13.422 --> 00:58:16.124]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:58:16.384 --> 00:58:22.288]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:58:22.648 --> 00:58:24.089]  This book will work for anyone.
[00:58:24.229 --> 00:58:26.511]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:58:26.711 --> 00:58:32.115]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:58:32.355 --> 00:58:34.156]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:58:34.437 --> 00:58:35.818]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:58:36.178 --> 00:58:38.440]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:43.083]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:58:43.443 --> 00:58:46.826]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[00:58:47.146 --> 00:58:49.287]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:50.269 --> 00:58:51.675]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:52.157 --> 00:58:52.840]  One last time.
[00:58:53.181 --> 00:58:54.286]  It's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:58:59.892 --> 00:59:02.494]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:59:02.894 --> 00:59:07.858]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:08.218 --> 00:59:09.960]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:15.084]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:15.284 --> 00:59:16.245]  How much do you want?
[00:59:16.465 --> 00:59:17.205]  When do you want it?
[00:59:17.586 --> 00:59:19.187]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:19.467 --> 00:59:20.288]  When will you need it?
[00:59:20.548 --> 00:59:22.609]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:22.749 --> 00:59:23.850]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:24.091 --> 00:59:25.432]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:25.612 --> 00:59:25.972]  If there's a
[00:59:26.032 --> 00:59:27.973]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:59:28.133 --> 00:59:30.675]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:30.855 --> 00:59:34.057]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:34.457 --> 00:59:37.940]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.260]  How much will you need?
[00:59:39.501 --> 00:59:40.101]  We don't know.
[00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:41.322]  How much do you want?
[00:59:41.502 --> 00:59:42.242]  All you can get.
[00:59:42.443 --> 00:59:42.823]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:43.183 --> 00:59:43.824]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.848 --> 01:00:06.888]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.629 --> 01:00:09.349]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.369 --> 01:00:10.189]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.969 --> 01:00:11.970]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:16.111]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.711 --> 01:00:20.812]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.274 --> 01:00:31.575]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:31.735 --> 01:00:34.736]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:00:36.502 --> 01:00:40.103]  Coming up, for the balance of the hour into the next hour, it's the next segment.
[01:00:40.123 --> 01:00:43.825]  We're going to have the makers of Camp FEMA on and talk about a host of issues.
[01:00:43.865 --> 01:00:49.807]  Get into the flu, get into big developments with the Hardin, Montana, American police force situation.
[01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:50.968]  I haven't gotten to that yet.
[01:00:51.048 --> 01:00:52.608]  Biggest developments yet in that case.
[01:00:53.429 --> 01:00:55.850]  But I wanted to hold Mike over to take some calls.
[01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.011]  Jasper in Mass, you're on the air.
[01:00:58.051 --> 01:00:59.011]  Go ahead, thanks for holding.
[01:01:00.191 --> 01:01:01.552]  Hey Alex, can you hear me okay?
[01:01:01.812 --> 01:01:02.112]  Yes sir.
[01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:08.209]  Listen, I think I've got breaking news that you'd be really interested in.
[01:01:08.229 --> 01:01:20.376]  We were looking on YouTube this morning and we found these clips that talk about NASA sending a bomb to the moon.
[01:01:20.436 --> 01:01:21.096]  Have you heard about that?
[01:01:21.116 --> 01:01:21.857]  Yeah, that's public.
[01:01:21.997 --> 01:01:23.378]  That's Reuters, AP.
[01:01:24.839 --> 01:01:49.075]  Since the Indian probe a few months ago found water all over the entire contiguous surface, even above the surface, in the dust, below the surface in large amounts, NASA's quickest thing they can do is to slam, they're calling it a bomb in the headlines, slam a satellite into it to then have spectrometers from a distance scan the water content because they want to find out the concentrations below ground.
[01:01:49.716 --> 01:01:50.976]  And so yes, it's very interesting.
[01:01:50.996 --> 01:01:51.717]  That's in my stack.
[01:01:53.151 --> 01:01:54.512]  Could this be the false flag?
[01:01:54.552 --> 01:02:13.099]  Because remember, well first of all, I wanted to point out that the date is essentially 199, which is pretty close to 9-1-1, and it's illegal to be doing any kind of weaponization stuff in space, I thought.
[01:02:13.119 --> 01:02:14.759]  I thought there was a ban on that.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:21.762]  And then, additionally, could this be the false flag event that they
[01:02:22.786 --> 01:02:24.269]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:25.871]  You know, I don't get into speculation here.
[01:02:38.683 --> 01:02:45.650]  We know it's a live virus they pump into the nasal cavity with the new flu vaccine and that it can mutate and spread the disease.
[01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:46.671]  We're covering it.
[01:02:47.371 --> 01:02:53.778]  We know a convicted felon fraud moved in and tried to take over a detention facility where they were talking about keeping terror suspects.
[01:02:55.599 --> 01:03:03.207]  We know that $23.7 trillion has been stolen from the people of this country in the last year.
[01:03:05.134 --> 01:03:06.615]  We know all this is happening.
[01:03:07.255 --> 01:03:10.437]  It's the wrong show, and I don't bash people that get off into different things.
[01:03:11.197 --> 01:03:20.742]  You know, I even knew about the water on the moon through Buzz Aldrin, through Charlie Sheen, before it was even in the news, and I didn't even mention that because it would just sound weird.
[01:03:21.122 --> 01:03:24.203]  Oh, Buzz Aldrin says they're going to announce the next month they found water on it.
[01:03:24.764 --> 01:03:26.825]  I told my wife about it, a few people around the office.
[01:03:27.445 --> 01:03:29.266]  I got some text messages from Charlie about it.
[01:03:29.886 --> 01:03:30.707]  But the point is,
[01:03:31.787 --> 01:03:35.134]  Is that I just don't get off into all that.
[01:03:35.494 --> 01:03:36.115]  Mike Rivera.
[01:03:37.526 --> 01:03:46.972]  Well, I mean, this is not weaponization, this is a repeat of what they did with the comet impactor mission, and it's becoming a standardized technique.
[01:03:47.052 --> 01:03:57.219]  You throw a large object into the celestial body you're investigating, and as you said correctly, you use a spectroscope on the debris to see what came out of the center.
[01:03:57.259 --> 01:04:01.922]  And this is a precursor to a possible permanent lunar base at the moon's south pole,
[01:04:02.282 --> 01:04:09.251]  Where if there is a source of water there underneath the regolith, it's going to make the logistics of supporting such a base that much easier.
[01:04:09.591 --> 01:04:15.639]  It's not a false flag, it's not weaponization, it's just the next step in establishing a permanent lunar colony.
[01:04:17.637 --> 01:04:18.318]  Absolutely.
[01:04:18.859 --> 01:04:19.580]  False flag.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:30.593]  I mean, having a satellite, little satellite, not that big of a satellite, slam in as a meteor gun into the surface of the moon so they can register how much water vapor comes up.
[01:04:30.653 --> 01:04:31.955]  I mean, that's not a false flag.
[01:04:32.675 --> 01:04:35.939]  But I'm not trying to make enemies of listeners disagreeing with you.
[01:04:36.019 --> 01:04:37.001]  I just, you know.
[01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:50.037]  I got so much stuff here I can prove that's off the charts insane, and nobody seems to care that the White House science czar has written more than 10 textbooks calling for the extermination of the majority of the public and forced drugging of the water supply to sterilizers.
[01:04:51.218 --> 01:04:57.562]  But I can get plenty of people to call in and tell me about reptoids, and I'm not bashing the people who think everybody's a reptoid.
[01:04:58.203 --> 01:04:59.604]  The point is, that isn't me.
[01:04:59.764 --> 01:05:00.524]  I'm not into that.
[01:05:01.085 --> 01:05:02.405]  I'm just into what I can prove.
[01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:04.987]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Maryland.
[01:05:05.007 --> 01:05:05.588]  You're on the air.
[01:05:05.628 --> 01:05:06.008]  Go ahead.
[01:05:07.796 --> 01:05:08.757]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:05:09.037 --> 01:05:09.477]  Good, buddy.
[01:05:10.518 --> 01:05:14.940]  Hey, I used to work for a wholesale store, and it's called Costco.
[01:05:16.181 --> 01:05:29.328]  Talking about the North American Union, and the meat boxes, and the meat labels, and the meat wrapper labels, they said a product of U.S., Canada, and Mexico.
[01:05:29.869 --> 01:05:33.571]  And sometimes they'll say Canada and Mexico, and
[01:05:35.879 --> 01:05:39.620]  And sometimes we'll say, a product of North America.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:06:00.603]  Well, I remember two years ago, I got the letter, because I have employees in Texas, from the Texas Workforce Commission, saying, you will no longer report your employee data, in workers comp, all that kind of stuff, to the Bureau of National Statistics, to the Labor Department, through us.
[01:06:01.004 --> 01:06:03.024]  You will report it to the North American Union.
[01:06:03.979 --> 01:06:06.280]  And it gave me my North American Union ID number.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:11.941]  And then, it's one of those things where it happens so close to home, I didn't even cover it for a few weeks.
[01:06:12.181 --> 01:06:13.882]  I didn't, it was so weird.
[01:06:14.582 --> 01:06:15.842]  My wife just pointed it out.
[01:06:15.942 --> 01:06:19.703]  And then, Jerome Corsi at Human Events and World Net Daily did report on it.
[01:06:20.203 --> 01:06:21.424]  Separately, people noticed.
[01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:23.784]  So, Mike Rivero comments on that.
[01:06:23.804 --> 01:06:25.365]  I mean, that's all this is, is being conquered.
[01:06:25.585 --> 01:06:33.247]  You have private banks come in, they announce new government agencies, they rewrite the laws in a tyrannical way, so they control everything, and that's it.
[01:06:34.502 --> 01:06:35.843]  Yeah, basically that's it.
[01:06:35.963 --> 01:06:44.209]  And that's the reason the first two United States central banks were shut down by courageous presidents who had more gonadal tissue than our current administration.
[01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:51.835]  And every time there has been a central bank privately owned, it has brought hardship and impoverishment to the American people.
[01:06:52.515 --> 01:06:56.597]  Uh, you know, when Ben Franklin was serving as ambassador to the court of St.
[01:06:56.657 --> 01:07:00.318]  James for the colonies and they said, what do you do with all your poor and unemployed?
[01:07:00.338 --> 01:07:01.699]  And he said, we don't have poor and unemployed.
[01:07:01.719 --> 01:07:05.941]  There's enough money around for everybody to have jobs and be carrying on their commerce.
[01:07:06.001 --> 01:07:11.123]  And immediately the bank of England went to King George the third and lobbied him to pass a currency act saying,
[01:07:11.383 --> 01:07:14.786]  That the colonies had to conform to the banking practices of the Bank of England.
[01:07:15.146 --> 01:07:21.412]  Two years later, there was massive poverty, massive unemployment, and that was where the anger for the American Revolution really came from.
[01:07:21.472 --> 01:07:24.514]  Forget about the Stamp Act and the T-Tax and all the rest of it.
[01:07:24.814 --> 01:07:29.558]  It was that deliberate impoverishment by a private bank that fueled the first American Revolution.
[01:07:29.619 --> 01:07:31.060]  And I think it might fuel the second.
[01:07:32.927 --> 01:07:34.648]  Well, you're absolutely right, Mike Rivera.
[01:07:35.388 --> 01:07:37.749]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:41.110]  I guess Kenny in Texas is up next, or is it Matthew?
[01:07:42.711 --> 01:07:43.411]  Kenny, welcome.
[01:07:44.191 --> 01:07:44.772]  How you doing?
[01:07:45.032 --> 01:07:46.692]  I'm a big fan, Alex.
[01:07:47.473 --> 01:07:52.374]  I just wanted to call because I kind of had an event the other day, and I just wanted to let you know about it.
[01:07:53.155 --> 01:08:01.358]  I stumbled into a volunteer firefighter, and he's FEMA certified to do a bunch of different things.
[01:08:02.487 --> 01:08:08.091]  And, uh, he has been practicing with the Galveston County Office of Emergency Management.
[01:08:09.332 --> 01:08:13.395]  And, uh, he showed me one of these bracelets that y'all were talking about.
[01:08:14.376 --> 01:08:18.298]  These bracelets with this RFID... Yeah, we weren't doing that.
[01:08:18.579 --> 01:08:25.784]  It was a medical person with the Army saying they're training with the CHIPS in California, the Highway Patrol, to do this.
[01:08:25.844 --> 01:08:28.666]  And then we confirmed in the UN documents they are preparing that.
[01:08:29.697 --> 01:08:32.780]  And they've since admitted they're preparing for mass quarantines and lockdowns.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:33.921]  That doesn't mean they're going to do it.
[01:08:33.961 --> 01:08:35.041]  They're just preparing for it.
[01:08:35.061 --> 01:08:40.526]  I want to make that clear, that clear distinction there.
[01:08:40.606 --> 01:08:41.307]  But go ahead.
[01:08:42.067 --> 01:08:43.008]  Yeah, I didn't really.
[01:08:43.108 --> 01:08:50.874]  I mean, whenever you go over talking about bracelets, it was kind of, you know, I didn't really believe it or not that I didn't believe it, but I just didn't know how it worked.
[01:08:51.074 --> 01:08:55.438]  And I went to the Galveston County Office of Emergency website.
[01:08:56.034 --> 01:08:59.635]  And they're showing little kids putting on these bracelets on the website.
[01:09:00.355 --> 01:09:00.995]  Excuse me?
[01:09:01.015 --> 01:09:03.276]  Now I want to put you on hold.
[01:09:03.336 --> 01:09:06.216]  I want you to send this to an email address we're going to give you.
[01:09:07.416 --> 01:09:09.817]  What's the best one to give him off there that's a direct line to us?
[01:09:11.817 --> 01:09:14.478]  John, John, John, give him Hartman's email.
[01:09:15.698 --> 01:09:19.299]  So this is the Galveston County Office of Emergency Management.
[01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:21.959]  It shows them getting the bracelets that they've had the shots.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.300]  No, not that they've had the shots, but that they're
[01:09:26.165 --> 01:09:31.430]  I guess, and it's got the Boy Scouts earned emergency merit badge.
[01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:33.051]  Okay, I'm not talking about merit badges.
[01:09:33.071 --> 01:09:33.852]  You said bracelets.
[01:09:33.872 --> 01:09:34.953]  What are they getting bracelets for?
[01:09:35.513 --> 01:09:42.079]  Well, I think they're just doing some kind of drill, putting the bracelets on.
[01:09:42.099 --> 01:09:44.361]  I don't, they're not getting a shot.
[01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:48.084]  They're just maybe practicing for an awareness.
[01:09:48.204 --> 01:09:49.085]  I'm not really sure.
[01:09:49.105 --> 01:09:51.427]  Well, what does it say?
[01:09:55.426 --> 01:09:58.687]  Okay, so that's the Galveston Office of Emergency Management.
[01:09:59.007 --> 01:10:00.648]  What does the header on the article say?
[01:10:01.288 --> 01:10:04.669]  New technology assists with evacuee tracking.
[01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:05.810]  That's what they're saying.
[01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:09.851]  Oh yeah, they did say in Texas when you're an evacuee they want to make you take a bracelet.
[01:10:10.151 --> 01:10:12.392]  Yeah, I saw that with Rick Perry six months ago.
[01:10:12.932 --> 01:10:15.814]  Okay, so new technology helps with evacuee preparedness.
[01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:16.614]  Is that it?
[01:10:17.253 --> 01:10:17.954]  Yep, that's it.
[01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:18.614]  Thank you.
[01:10:18.634 --> 01:10:19.134]  We'll pull it up.
[01:10:19.194 --> 01:10:20.175]  Yes, I am aware of that.
[01:10:20.735 --> 01:10:24.238]  Well, that's just like they're announcing they want you to wear shock bracelets.
[01:10:24.338 --> 01:10:25.579]  Everybody that gets on the airplane.
[01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:27.080]  Homeland Security did consider that.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.283]  Or they're announcing that the city police everywhere want neighbors to spy on neighbors.
[01:10:32.744 --> 01:10:38.368]  And there's another article where they're admitting they want to put passive MRIs scanning us on the highways.
[01:10:38.428 --> 01:10:40.149]  Mike Rivero, closing comments on that.
[01:10:40.854 --> 01:10:46.583]  Yeah, we're getting into this total scan surveillance now because of that botched assassination attempt in Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:46.603 --> 01:10:51.330]  They're talking about literally scanning the insides of our bodies before we're allowed on airplanes.
[01:10:52.131 --> 01:10:53.393]  You know, we're getting into this.
[01:10:53.413 --> 01:10:53.814]  X-rays!
[01:10:54.395 --> 01:10:55.336]  X-raying the people.
[01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:56.057]  Get a chest X-ray.
[01:10:56.077 --> 01:10:56.438]  Here we go.
[01:10:57.352 --> 01:11:11.501]  Yeah, and it's reached a ridiculous degree because, you know, from bracelets the next step will be the implantable chip and the idea is to get us all tagged with a number so that we can be tracked and taxed and there is no escape from the system.
[01:11:11.841 --> 01:11:18.946]  And that's really what it's all about, is making sure that nobody can decide to go off the grid and not be part of the farm animals.
[01:11:20.063 --> 01:11:20.663]  Absolutely.
[01:11:20.703 --> 01:11:26.004]  Homeland Security plans to scan air travelers bodily functions.
[01:11:26.885 --> 01:11:28.145]  And here's another one.
[01:11:28.165 --> 01:11:31.626]  New technology assist with evacuee tracking.
[01:11:31.986 --> 01:11:37.407]  And there they are getting the little bracelets that they also have been reporting they're going to make us take at the checkpoints.
[01:11:37.447 --> 01:11:42.028]  If you don't have that bracelet, you'll be taken off to a FEMA camp, according to the police and military that are speaking out.
[01:11:42.328 --> 01:11:44.889]  And Homeland Security says, yes, we are studying that right now.
[01:11:45.789 --> 01:11:47.090]  Thank you so much, Mike Rivera.
[01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:49.432]  We'll see you next month at WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.354]  Of course, as always, we'll be able to check you out there.
[01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:52.635]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[01:11:53.236 --> 01:11:54.016]  Thank you for having me.
[01:11:54.357 --> 01:11:54.697]  You bet.
[01:11:55.438 --> 01:11:57.439]  Camp FEMA directors and producers coming up.
[01:11:57.459 --> 01:11:57.880]  Stay with us.
[01:11:59.972 --> 01:12:03.134]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[01:12:50.781 --> 01:12:51.161]  That's 208-772-4514.
[01:12:56.983 --> 01:12:58.823]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[01:13:00.024 --> 01:13:01.424]  It is a big idea.
[01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:03.565]  A New World Order.
[01:13:04.265 --> 01:13:09.006]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:13:09.146 --> 01:13:11.947]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:14.207]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:13:14.767 --> 01:13:17.228]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:13:17.948 --> 01:13:25.250]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:13:28.308 --> 01:13:33.271]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:13:33.752 --> 01:13:37.134]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:13:58.969 --> 01:14:05.174]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:14:05.634 --> 01:14:13.401]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:14:13.741 --> 01:14:21.628]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:14:21.928 --> 01:14:26.672]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:14:26.992 --> 01:14:31.695]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:14:32.215 --> 01:14:36.057]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:14:36.557 --> 01:14:37.578]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:14:37.658 --> 01:14:41.740]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.581]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:14:47.043 --> 01:14:49.605]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:14:50.045 --> 01:14:52.167]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:52.307 --> 01:14:55.249]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:55.389 --> 01:15:00.052]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:15:00.712 --> 01:15:05.536]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[01:15:06.576 --> 01:15:14.662]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[01:15:15.563 --> 01:15:17.503]  Rely on OxySilver instead.
[01:15:18.424 --> 01:15:23.784]  OxySilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[01:15:24.265 --> 01:15:27.005]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[01:15:27.545 --> 01:15:29.265]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.
[01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:34.526]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[01:15:34.806 --> 01:15:38.067]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[01:15:38.547 --> 01:15:40.187]  So get it while you still can.
[01:15:40.787 --> 01:15:44.028]  Order OxySilver online at OxySilver.com.

[01:16:14.329 --> 01:16:19.914]  William Lewis, maker of Camp FEMA, joins us along with the producer Gary Franchi.
[01:16:22.416 --> 01:16:25.678]  When they approached me about being in the film, I was very excited and I consulted on it.
[01:16:26.539 --> 01:16:32.364]  I worked with them on making sure the information was accurate and they've done a great job.
[01:16:32.844 --> 01:16:39.669]  It shows how we've turned into a prison economy, how our entire economy is converting over to surveillance, prisons, police state.
[01:16:40.475 --> 01:16:42.497]  We have more prisons than any other country in the world.
[01:16:42.657 --> 01:16:48.401]  The federal government designates sports stadiums and other facilities as mass holding centers, mass inoculation centers.
[01:16:48.862 --> 01:16:49.983]  They go over all of that.
[01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:51.864]  They show the gun confiscations in New Orleans.
[01:16:51.884 --> 01:16:56.648]  They show the Rex 84, the admitted camp plans, the government documents.
[01:16:57.368 --> 01:16:58.790]  They actually go out to some of the camps.
[01:16:59.690 --> 01:17:07.537]  And I just got back from spending three days in Hardin, Montana,
[01:17:08.584 --> 01:17:14.528]  Just to show how corrupt society is, where a known convicted felon con artist could just come into town.
[01:17:15.389 --> 01:17:21.633]  The tiny town of three and a half thousand built a 464 bed prison.
[01:17:21.873 --> 01:17:24.075]  They wanted to put Abu Ghraib people in there.
[01:17:24.095 --> 01:17:25.916]  They wanted to put Camp X-Ray people in there.
[01:17:26.576 --> 01:17:30.119]  Now they just want to put the citizens, and they call it an economic development plan.
[01:17:30.599 --> 01:17:31.039]  Prisons!
[01:17:31.159 --> 01:17:33.161]  That's what we have is putting you in jail.
[01:17:34.454 --> 01:17:35.734]  And so this is all around us.
[01:17:35.794 --> 01:17:42.336]  And then you dovetail it with all the surveillance and the Big Brother and the Homeland Security plans to scan air travelers' bodily functions.
[01:17:44.136 --> 01:17:45.457]  All of this is unfolding.
[01:17:45.497 --> 01:17:48.658]  So I wanted to get the makers of Camp FEMA on today.
[01:17:49.038 --> 01:17:53.599]  And I wanted to remind listeners, we have it available at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:17:54.479 --> 01:17:56.079]  Again, InfoWars.com.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:02.641]  It is available for everybody out there.
[01:18:05.087 --> 01:18:12.273]  Uh, we hope that people will go and order it and show it to their friends and family because this film needs to be seen.
[01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:13.774]  Camp FEMA available right now.
[01:18:14.074 --> 01:18:16.055]  Let's go to Gary Franchi and William Lewis.
[01:18:16.376 --> 01:18:17.757]  Guys, good to have you on the show with us.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.361]  Uh, let's go to Franchi first.
[01:18:23.421 --> 01:18:32.428]  Franchi, uh, this is your first, I guess, big direct, uh, not directorial, but producer debut, and I'm glad that the film's a success because it needs to be seen.
[01:18:34.934 --> 01:18:38.116]  You mentioned it yourself just now about home screenings.
[01:18:38.556 --> 01:18:55.085]  We want people to invite their friends and family over to their house, sit down and analyze the film, take the facts in, and spread this message to their loved ones because what's happening in America needs to stop.
[01:18:55.885 --> 01:19:04.808]  You know, the demonizing of constitutional Americans in the BIAC report, Homeland Security documents, you know, the growth of this prison-industrial complex that you just went off the heart in.
[01:19:05.448 --> 01:19:11.150]  I mean, these are all facts that are covered in the film that, you know, obviously the mainstream media doesn't want to cover.
[01:19:11.190 --> 01:19:14.512]  Glenn Beck is just whitewashing the whole thing with popular mechanics.
[01:19:15.172 --> 01:19:21.214]  And, you know, these facts need to be exposed, and that's why we put the film together, just to do that.
[01:19:22.998 --> 01:19:24.119]  Well, I'm glad you did it.
[01:19:25.139 --> 01:19:26.500]  Let's go to William Lewis.
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:29.282]  William, in a nutshell, break down what Camp FEMA covers.
[01:19:30.442 --> 01:19:30.782]  Okay.
[01:19:30.842 --> 01:19:37.366]  Camp FEMA, we start back in the 1940s, show people how these internment camps are really nothing new.
[01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:38.427]  This has happened before.
[01:19:38.987 --> 01:19:52.635]  We show the similarities between those camps that were built back in the 1940s and the HR 645 legislation that we see introduced recently by Alcee Hastings of Florida, and we compare
[01:19:53.507 --> 01:19:54.607]  What did they do back then?
[01:19:54.687 --> 01:19:55.768]  What do they want in this bill?
[01:19:55.788 --> 01:19:56.768]  How similar are they?
[01:19:56.888 --> 01:19:59.329]  And, you know, come to find out, they're very similar in fact.
[01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:10.332]  We go through all of the legislation, the documentation, FBI, Senate COINTELPRO, everything, trying to explain to people that this is really nothing new.
[01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:11.913]  This is a pattern we've established.
[01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:19.752]  And, you know, we even see some of the same wording and the same phrases come up telling us what they want to do to us, how they want to do it.
[01:20:20.152 --> 01:20:25.214]  And now they've got internment camps being, you know, just built right out in the open.
[01:20:25.514 --> 01:20:27.115]  Contractors being hired to do it.
[01:20:27.735 --> 01:20:34.998]  And, you know, the National Guard is actually actively hiring for these positions of internment and resettlement specialists.
[01:20:35.639 --> 01:20:40.501]  So you put all this together, put some photos with it, and we kind of show
[01:20:41.741 --> 01:20:53.400]  Show people that FEMA camps are no longer this internet-based conspiracy theory, that it is very much based in reality and based in black and white, as we show in the documentary.
[01:20:54.494 --> 01:20:56.215]  And the denial is over with this film.
[01:20:56.235 --> 01:20:58.956]  I mean, the rumors and the documentation is total.
[01:20:59.317 --> 01:21:05.760]  We need to have a national debate about how they're setting up fusion centers, putting brigade homeland on the streets, taking over our society.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.781]  Can't FEMA does that?
[01:21:08.701 --> 01:21:10.082]  And so the denial can end.
[01:21:10.142 --> 01:21:12.083]  This country is turning into a giant prison grid.
[01:21:12.103 --> 01:21:19.287]  The military industrial complex is just coming back to America and taking us over and ruling us and making their police state profitable.
[01:21:19.547 --> 01:21:22.789]  You have all these private interests that make the profits off what they've set up.
[01:21:24.684 --> 01:21:25.664]  Well, I mean, that's what's happening.
[01:21:26.085 --> 01:21:27.705]  Look at the prison-inmate labor program.
[01:21:30.887 --> 01:21:31.527]  Absolutely.
[01:21:31.547 --> 01:21:33.628]  All right, men, stay there.
[01:21:33.648 --> 01:21:34.309]  I want to come back.
[01:21:34.329 --> 01:21:41.192]  I want people to be able to call in, too, and ask you guys questions about Camp FEMA and what you've learned about the New World Order's gulag or grapelago.
[01:21:41.492 --> 01:21:44.574]  We'll tie it into Hardin, Montana, with big developments there on the other side.
[01:21:44.594 --> 01:21:44.894]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:21:44.914 --> 01:21:46.895]  More financial news and flu news coming up, too.
[01:21:46.915 --> 01:21:47.895]  We're on the march.
[01:21:47.935 --> 01:21:49.116]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.253 --> 01:21:56.994]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:59.595 --> 01:22:03.557]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:22:03.817 --> 01:22:05.618]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:14.101]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:22:14.361 --> 01:22:19.563]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:22:19.903 --> 01:22:21.524]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:22:21.764 --> 01:22:28.085]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:22:28.265 --> 01:22:39.028]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:22:39.308 --> 01:22:39.828]  That's right.
[01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:42.408]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:22:42.648 --> 01:22:44.429]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-HELP.
[01:22:46.810 --> 01:23:04.802]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:23:04.922 --> 01:23:06.863]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:23:07.003 --> 01:23:09.284]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:23:09.445 --> 01:23:11.286]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:23:11.706 --> 01:23:13.067]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:23:13.347 --> 01:23:14.368]  There is a solution.
[01:23:14.608 --> 01:23:22.610]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:23:59.997 --> 01:24:08.681]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[01:24:08.921 --> 01:24:18.505]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.

[01:25:35.287 --> 01:25:36.268]  Central Standard Time.
[01:25:36.308 --> 01:25:47.036]  We are here live with enemies lined up around the block, but listeners and supporters and fellow patriots across the planet growing by leaps and bounds every single day.
[01:25:47.076 --> 01:25:48.357]  We are so honored to be here with you.
[01:25:48.757 --> 01:25:54.602]  Before we go back to our guest in Camp FEMA and start taking some of your phone calls getting to the new developments at the Hardin Jail.
[01:25:56.195 --> 01:26:03.402]  I want to encourage everybody to go to Infowars.com today and get your pre-order in today.

[01:26:41.446 --> 01:26:44.768]  You can also go to prisonplanet.tv and watch the latest trailer.
[01:26:44.788 --> 01:26:46.209]  It will premiere there October 21st.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:54.582]  At PrisonPlanet.tv for all the wonderful members there that are also watching us live as we simulcast right now.
[01:26:56.202 --> 01:26:59.963]  But I just want to ask everybody to make this the biggest film we've ever released.
[01:27:00.383 --> 01:27:01.563]  To make it the most viral.
[01:27:01.603 --> 01:27:02.683]  To spread it on the internet.
[01:27:02.924 --> 01:27:03.944]  To make copies of it.
[01:27:03.984 --> 01:27:06.184]  To give it to your friends, your families, and neighbors.
[01:27:06.384 --> 01:27:07.605]  They cannot stop the signal.
[01:27:07.645 --> 01:27:13.026]  This exposes who the bankers are, what they're doing, what they're setting up, and how we can stop them.
[01:27:13.066 --> 01:27:15.367]  It's Fall of the Republic, Volume 1.
[01:27:15.667 --> 01:27:16.847]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:23.166 --> 01:27:26.828]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:27:27.968 --> 01:27:30.929]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:36.752]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:27:36.772 --> 01:27:43.035]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:27:44.804 --> 01:27:49.810]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[01:27:50.011 --> 01:27:55.037]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:27:56.899 --> 01:28:01.085]  One of the greatest events in history is taking place before our very eyes.
[01:28:04.568 --> 01:28:10.011]  If I have a question for this young man, he has the right to be represented!
[01:28:10.231 --> 01:28:21.357]  It's up to every man, woman, and child in the United States to decide whether we're going to be fooled by the slick propaganda of the social engineers, or whether we're going to restore the republic.
[01:28:22.458 --> 01:28:26.800]  We have seen this erosion to the point where today it seems like nobody does care.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:32.163]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:28:37.213 --> 01:28:39.174]  Who's going to soak up the derivatives?
[01:28:39.234 --> 01:28:40.755]  Who's going to soak up the debt?
[01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:42.076]  Who's going to be penalized?
[01:28:42.596 --> 01:28:51.142]  Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[01:28:52.823 --> 01:28:53.223]  I don't know.
[01:28:53.243 --> 01:28:59.587]  Do you think it's consistent with the spirit of that provision of the Constitution to hand out half a trillion dollars to foreigners?
[01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:03.009]  Will we choose liberty or will we choose tyranny?
[01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:05.411]  The Republic is hanging by a thread.
[01:29:05.851 --> 01:29:07.172]  You don't have a president.
[01:29:07.712 --> 01:29:08.673]  You have an actor.
[01:29:08.773 --> 01:29:09.453]  Tim Geithner?
[01:29:09.953 --> 01:29:10.313]  Bernanke?
[01:29:10.333 --> 01:29:11.194]  They're arsonists!
[01:29:11.454 --> 01:29:12.775]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:29:13.355 --> 01:29:15.616]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:29:15.736 --> 01:29:16.977]  Who do we sell these matches to?
[01:29:17.657 --> 01:29:21.980]  The last vestiges of our free system of government are being swept away.
[01:29:23.561 --> 01:29:24.921]  Fall of the Republic.
[01:29:26.382 --> 01:29:26.842]  Volume 1.
[01:29:27.703 --> 01:29:29.384]  The Presidency of Barack Obama.
[01:29:30.592 --> 01:29:36.615]  Available on DVD at InfoWars.com and online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:37.475 --> 01:29:40.076]  The destiny of humanity is in our hands.
[01:29:41.517 --> 01:29:42.597]  October 21st, 2009.
[01:29:43.097 --> 01:29:47.079]  Alright, that is the new trailer.
[01:29:47.319 --> 01:29:50.180]  It's going up on the Alex Jones Channel at YouTube in the next few minutes.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:53.402]  Please help spread it virally, just like you've done with
[01:29:54.363 --> 01:29:55.064]  Camp FEMA.
[01:29:55.564 --> 01:29:59.006]  But this Fall of the Republic film gets into everything.
[01:29:59.046 --> 01:30:03.529]  The mind control, the bankers, who they are, their master plan, how to stop them, what they're doing.
[01:30:05.151 --> 01:30:09.253]  The establishment can only succeed if the people are not aware of what's going on.
[01:30:09.474 --> 01:30:16.298]  You are the ones that will make Fall of the Republic effective, just like you did with the Obama deception and are continuing to do.
[01:30:16.358 --> 01:30:23.944]  Going back to Gary Franchi and William Lewis, you guys aren't watching us, I guess, on PrisonPlanet.tv, but hearing that, does that sound pretty exciting?
[01:30:24.921 --> 01:30:26.202]  Oh, I can't wait to see it.
[01:30:27.283 --> 01:30:27.823]  I'm excited.
[01:30:29.284 --> 01:30:30.425]  We're going to get free copy, right?
[01:30:30.965 --> 01:30:31.946]  Absolutely, Lewis!
[01:30:32.006 --> 01:30:34.848]  Alright, alright.
[01:30:35.188 --> 01:30:36.329]  Enough of me talking about that.
[01:30:36.369 --> 01:30:37.650]  I just know people will pre-order.
[01:30:37.670 --> 01:30:39.291]  We want to have a big push right up front.
[01:30:39.311 --> 01:30:42.713]  Everybody getting copies, making copies, spreading it, getting it out to everybody.
[01:30:43.634 --> 01:30:45.995]  We've got all sorts of harassment going on over this film.
[01:30:46.155 --> 01:30:46.896]  Later it'll come out.
[01:30:46.916 --> 01:30:48.417]  We're getting harassment out of Chicago.
[01:30:49.991 --> 01:30:50.732]  Well, no death threats yet.
[01:30:50.792 --> 01:30:52.693]  Actually, the reception for Camp FEMA has been quite well.
[01:31:18.044 --> 01:31:26.750]  You know, we get tons of emails just on a daily basis that I never have the time to return every single one of them, but we try.
[01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:29.832]  Maybe we should go through a list.
[01:31:29.912 --> 01:31:31.593]  You know, we've got several things coming up.
[01:31:32.013 --> 01:31:36.796]  The Midwest Liberty Fest is coming up this weekend where people can go out and watch Camp FEMA there.
[01:31:37.717 --> 01:31:42.600]  There's a Canadian theatrical premiere coming up in Toronto on October the 17th.
[01:31:44.056 --> 01:31:44.156]  Sure.
[01:31:55.083 --> 01:31:59.845]  Then we've got, you know, right after that, the next day, there's another screening in Ohio.
[01:31:59.865 --> 01:32:01.445]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[01:32:01.465 --> 01:32:02.326]  Yeah, that's exciting.
[01:32:02.386 --> 01:32:04.306]  People are out there spreading and getting involved.
[01:32:04.346 --> 01:32:04.927]  That's important.
[01:32:05.267 --> 01:32:07.688]  More about the film, though, for people that haven't seen it.
[01:32:07.988 --> 01:32:10.809]  I mean, it could be... I mean, I, of course, am in the film.
[01:32:10.869 --> 01:32:11.669]  Other great people are.
[01:32:11.709 --> 01:32:15.891]  But the point is, it really lays out just the facts and exposes what's going on.
[01:32:17.191 --> 01:32:21.993]  We can't talk about FEMA camps without talking about the mindset of our leaders in Washington.
[01:32:22.694 --> 01:32:24.775]  And how this has been done in history's past.
[01:32:24.855 --> 01:32:31.138]  How have past dictatorial regimes come into power?
[01:32:31.218 --> 01:32:36.361]  How did they get the people in Germany to go along with rounding up the Jews?
[01:32:36.901 --> 01:32:38.802]  Those are the types of things that we're looking at.
[01:32:38.842 --> 01:32:45.685]  We've gone out to people like Chuck Baldwin, who was specifically named in the Mayak Report, to tell us how they've done this in the past.
[01:32:46.363 --> 01:32:59.610]  And, you know, we know that they want to demonize and marginalize everything that anyone says who might be opposed to gun control, or opposed to income tax, abortion, illegal immigration, whatever your single issue is.
[01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:02.632]  The private Federal Reserve, they demonize those groups.
[01:33:03.332 --> 01:33:04.153]  The United Nations.
[01:33:04.433 --> 01:33:06.174]  People who use the term the New World Order.
[01:33:06.194 --> 01:33:13.098]  That's why we have some representation in here from the Constitution Party, because, you know, that's even in, I believe, a part of their platform.
[01:33:13.118 --> 01:33:15.679]  And I was just researching last night on some of these
[01:33:16.582 --> 01:33:29.397]  Though I have more than 10 mainstream news articles saying the demise of the dollar, rise of the new world order.
[01:33:29.417 --> 01:33:31.079]  You know, that's what we say.
[01:33:31.119 --> 01:33:35.484]  Fall of the republic, birth of the new world order, rise of the resistance.
[01:33:37.045 --> 01:33:46.033]  They're announcing world government owned and run by private banks, what we always said it would be, we were reading their own documents, and they still say it doesn't exist.
[01:33:46.394 --> 01:33:48.436]  That's a military psych warfare term.
[01:33:49.337 --> 01:33:51.859]  That's done, that out of hand.
[01:33:52.119 --> 01:33:54.001]  Gary Franci, speak to that, because I know you've studied it.
[01:33:54.321 --> 01:33:58.605]  How they'll deny something even as it's happening to make it about the debate.
[01:33:59.528 --> 01:34:00.769]  Of whether it exists or not.
[01:34:01.089 --> 01:34:08.233]  It's like, I'm still debating with Hardin Montana, should, you know, is this guy a felon when it's admitted he's a felon con artist?
[01:34:09.914 --> 01:34:12.516]  And I'm telling him for a week it's a fake contract.
[01:34:12.836 --> 01:34:13.216]  Go ahead.
[01:34:13.937 --> 01:34:16.118]  I'm just saying, it's classical William Doublespeak.
[01:34:16.899 --> 01:34:18.640]  You know, they say it is when it isn't.
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:19.960]  And when it is, it's not.
[01:34:20.481 --> 01:34:24.123]  You know, it's just playing my games with the American people.
[01:34:24.523 --> 01:34:26.484]  I'm like, you just quoted all these headlines.
[01:34:26.564 --> 01:34:29.066]  I've seen the headlines out there in the mainstream news.
[01:34:29.741 --> 01:34:30.141]  Absolutely.
[01:34:30.161 --> 01:34:30.502]  Continuing
[01:34:59.266 --> 01:35:13.235]  Just with the news we're witnessing, before I get into some other facets of the police state, what did you guys think about the Hardin situation with the mercenaries and taking over the prison facility they wanted to hold prisoners in?
[01:35:13.716 --> 01:35:28.105]  I told local media that when I was inside, we even have footage of this, and Becky Shea saying don't tape that, they had on the wall enemy combatant area, enemy combatant holding, alien holding area,
[01:35:32.857 --> 01:35:44.812]  The local newspaper spun that and said Jones was on air saying packets of mustard in Becky Shea's desk were mustard gas.
[01:35:46.431 --> 01:35:51.694]  I never said anything about mustard, and that space aliens were being kept there.
[01:35:52.154 --> 01:35:54.116]  Now, that's how they spin this.
[01:35:54.596 --> 01:35:57.137]  Becky Shea made a joke in front of the, on the radio.
[01:35:57.177 --> 01:35:59.859]  She said, oh, there's, you know, there's nothing back there.
[01:35:59.879 --> 01:36:04.582]  I don't want you back in that area of the prison because there's nothing but a bunch of mustard packages in the desk.
[01:36:05.262 --> 01:36:16.465]  So her saying a joke about mustard packages on video, we have this on video, turns into, I say there's mustard gas, which I never said, and I'm saying space aliens area 51 are there.
[01:36:16.525 --> 01:36:16.725]  No!
[01:36:17.085 --> 01:36:23.266]  They had big ol' maps of blueprints saying alien detention area.
[01:36:24.927 --> 01:36:26.287]  Here's my take on it, Alex.
[01:36:26.707 --> 01:36:34.509]  From my research and from my talk with National Guardsmen, I've learned that there is a huge swath of good,
[01:36:35.271 --> 01:37:01.410]  Americans who are serving this country, and they have said that they will refuse the orders when it comes down to take the guns and to round up people, but the powers that be, the New World Order, needs the private mercenary army to fill the gap when the American military decides, you know, the grunts, the hard-working guys, decide they're not going to follow these orders.
[01:37:02.231 --> 01:37:03.472]  I mean, they're out there saying it.
[01:37:04.930 --> 01:37:11.076]  So, these mercenary forces like Blackwater, like American Police Force, are there to fill the void?
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:15.721]  Well, they certainly are.
[01:37:16.101 --> 01:37:24.830]  But, you know, I know Ron Paul got more contributions than anybody else from the military, and I know I run into a lot of even TSA people when I'm flying that are fans and want my signature.
[01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:25.731]  The majority of them.
[01:37:25.751 --> 01:37:26.532]  It's freaking me out.
[01:37:27.551 --> 01:37:29.974]  But then I go to places like Billings, Montana.
[01:37:29.994 --> 01:37:31.575]  They were the worst Nazis I've ever seen.
[01:37:31.636 --> 01:37:32.917]  Harassing old ladies, us.
[01:37:33.938 --> 01:37:34.719]  Really embarrassing.
[01:37:34.739 --> 01:37:35.660]  I was embarrassed for them.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:36.381]  Sickening.
[01:37:36.981 --> 01:37:37.662]  A power trip.
[01:37:38.443 --> 01:37:40.125]  But you look at yesterday.
[01:37:40.145 --> 01:37:41.987]  400 people show up at the park.
[01:37:42.087 --> 01:37:42.708]  They're peaceful.
[01:37:42.968 --> 01:37:44.490]  They're told you're not allowed to protest.
[01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:45.130]  They arrest them.
[01:37:46.151 --> 01:37:50.374]  G20, old women coming out of stores with bags going, what's going on officer?
[01:37:50.414 --> 01:37:51.215]  Shut up, bitch!
[01:37:51.615 --> 01:37:55.778]  Hitting her with clubs, police dogs attacking her, and then the cops defend it.
[01:37:56.218 --> 01:38:00.081]  Driving down neighborhoods, hitting nine-year-old kids in their front yard playing football.
[01:38:00.602 --> 01:38:02.003]  I mean, the cops were out of control.
[01:38:02.043 --> 01:38:05.905]  My guys got footage hiding in stores of them just driving around attacking anybody on the street.
[01:38:06.366 --> 01:38:10.188]  Then they go over and attack the university two nights in a row.
[01:38:10.469 --> 01:38:12.910]  My guys weren't there on the 24th, so I said go over there on the 25th.
[01:38:14.178 --> 01:38:23.560]  They surrounded the park, wouldn't let the media out, arrested Rob Dew, beat up Luke Radowski, and then charged Dew with stuff the night before, even though he wasn't even there.
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:24.940]  He's charged with the 24th.
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:27.960]  And we've called the prosecutors, and they're like, that's the way it is.
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:29.061]  We don't care if it's the wrong day.
[01:38:29.321 --> 01:38:30.201]  Go to hell!
[01:38:30.581 --> 01:38:36.322]  I mean, it's just a criminal government, and the National Guard was ready to fire sound cannons at people.
[01:38:36.662 --> 01:38:42.143]  The police enjoyed running up to women, I mean, little college girls, and going,
[01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:46.284]  God, hitting them with clubs, and then hitting them again when they try to get up.
[01:38:48.825 --> 01:38:49.506]  So I don't know.
[01:38:49.986 --> 01:38:56.888]  I mean, I know there's a lot of police and military say they're awake, but I think under peer pressure, if they told them take a two-year-old baby and shoot it in the back of the head, I think they'd do it.
[01:38:59.549 --> 01:39:03.611]  You know, we had our own cameraman out there for our show, The Reality Report, Lee.
[01:39:03.831 --> 01:39:05.652]  You know, he was rounded up right alongside Lee.
[01:39:05.932 --> 01:39:08.873]  And all he was doing, he was rounded up right alongside Luke.
[01:39:09.253 --> 01:39:11.814]  And all he was doing was pointing a camera in the direction of tyranny.
[01:39:12.711 --> 01:39:26.878]  You know, I mean, these police, like you say, when they're lined up, when they've got all their body armor on, they've got their gas, yes, there is a gang mentality that takes over, you know, and they want that paycheck.
[01:39:28.099 --> 01:39:30.540]  So, you know, we have to get to the police and military.
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:32.161]  We have to reach out to them.
[01:39:32.621 --> 01:39:34.883]  They are the front lines, and we have to wake them up, too.
[01:39:37.564 --> 01:39:38.545]  Well, absolutely.
[01:39:40.981 --> 01:39:42.722]  Well, let me get into the Hardin situation.
[01:39:44.043 --> 01:39:52.287]  We found out last Sunday, I heard about it Friday, didn't check into it, but last, not this Sunday, but the same before, like 10, 11 days ago.
[01:39:53.788 --> 01:39:56.230]  We found out that this guy was a felon.
[01:39:56.530 --> 01:39:57.790]  We found out he had aliases.
[01:39:57.831 --> 01:40:00.132]  We found out he was tied into these other defense contractors.
[01:40:01.482 --> 01:40:05.785]  We found out he didn't have a license to take over the giant detention center, $27 million.
[01:40:06.546 --> 01:40:07.887]  They were policing the town.
[01:40:07.947 --> 01:40:10.409]  They had gone to city council saying, we're going to be your new police.
[01:40:10.889 --> 01:40:12.891]  That's now admitted in the news, Billings Gazette.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:19.485]  And I went to Hardin and the locals were all, most of them were fans of the show, it blew me away.
[01:40:19.885 --> 01:40:25.170]  But the constabulary, the local sheriff's people and others, they were on power trips saying, why don't you get out of here?
[01:40:25.210 --> 01:40:26.071]  You don't belong around here.
[01:40:26.111 --> 01:40:27.352]  But this guy's from Serbia.
[01:40:27.392 --> 01:40:28.212]  Well, we like him.
[01:40:28.633 --> 01:40:30.655]  And I would say, but he's a convicted felon.
[01:40:30.715 --> 01:40:31.535]  He's a con artist.
[01:40:31.856 --> 01:40:33.737]  He doesn't have the money to lease this facility.
[01:40:34.058 --> 01:40:35.819]  He wants, he's in a police uniform.
[01:40:35.859 --> 01:40:37.281]  He's just going to suck off the town.
[01:40:37.741 --> 01:40:39.683]  He's a, he's a convicted 14 time
[01:40:41.184 --> 01:40:46.428]  Grand, you know, theft, criminal, he wants to be in a badge and gun, a true criminal regime.
[01:40:46.788 --> 01:40:48.349]  And they said, we don't care if he's a criminal.
[01:40:48.489 --> 01:40:53.493]  Some of the locals told me, because they thought they were part of the establishment, and they said, no, he's real.
[01:40:55.054 --> 01:40:56.875]  Now, he's the head of American Police Force.
[01:40:57.336 --> 01:41:00.578]  Then they called up a lawyer who was supposedly the head, and he said, no, I'm not even part of it.
[01:41:03.991 --> 01:41:11.934]  They described the Two Rivers Authority meeting last night in the Billings Gazette as if the one guy was bad, who said, I don't want to be part of this and this is a fraud.
[01:41:12.214 --> 01:41:15.036]  The other members were still saying, we want to do this deal.
[01:41:15.616 --> 01:41:24.800]  So even when they know it's a con artist, know it's a fraud, know it's a scam, the locals wanted to literally police the town themselves and literally be predators.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.642]  And here it is, red flags cause Montana officials to nix American police force deal.
[01:41:29.922 --> 01:41:31.022]  There was no deal.
[01:41:31.062 --> 01:41:31.663]  It was a scam.
[01:41:32.603 --> 01:41:37.707]  California judge orders head of Hardin Jail Project to court for millions of dollars of fraud.
[01:41:39.668 --> 01:41:42.711]  Two Rivers Board raises questions about Hardin prison contract.
[01:41:43.211 --> 01:41:44.933]  It's all a fraud.
[01:41:44.953 --> 01:41:47.154]  APF frontman loses credibility in Hardin.
[01:41:47.434 --> 01:41:58.663]  The reason I bring this up, guys, is that if mercenaries can just show up, and he did have German and other mercenaries with him, and think they're just going to, and they were going to get away with it until we got involved, the listeners especially.
[01:41:59.063 --> 01:42:00.845]  And we are blamed by the locals for stopping it.
[01:42:01.365 --> 01:42:02.025]  They're very angry.
[01:42:02.045 --> 01:42:04.046]  They're not mad that we warned them about a con artist.
[01:42:04.106 --> 01:42:05.366]  They wanted to be part of it.
[01:42:05.626 --> 01:42:06.727]  They wanted to do this.
[01:42:06.747 --> 01:42:07.447]  They loved him.
[01:42:07.827 --> 01:42:09.728]  It was, you know, thugs loving thugs.
[01:42:10.808 --> 01:42:16.110]  That in America, any type of criminal operation can just take over as long as it's wearing a badge.
[01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:16.750]  Gary Franchi?
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:20.962]  Well, you know, they are willing to take the money and run.
[01:42:21.022 --> 01:42:22.423]  That's what it comes down to, you know?
[01:42:22.683 --> 01:42:28.866]  They get these big promises from this guy, this fraud, this charlatan, to come into town like a snake oil salesman.
[01:42:29.186 --> 01:42:33.449]  I'm going to boost your economy, I'm going to bring all these jobs, and I'm going to employ all of your people.
[01:42:33.929 --> 01:42:35.010]  That's all they saw.
[01:42:35.250 --> 01:42:36.210]  That's all they saw.
[01:42:37.011 --> 01:42:38.071]  They didn't look at the repercussions.
[01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:39.292]  They just saw the dollars, son.
[01:42:41.693 --> 01:42:44.615]  I want to get William Lewis' take on this, but there's the big development.
[01:42:46.778 --> 01:42:48.982]  He did meet with a bunch of big defense contractors.
[01:42:49.022 --> 01:42:51.106]  He was talking about contracting with them there.
[01:42:51.386 --> 01:42:52.428]  But they aren't involved.
[01:42:52.468 --> 01:42:53.470]  There are no backers.
[01:42:53.851 --> 01:42:55.133]  It's all a complete fraud.
[01:42:55.434 --> 01:42:57.618]  And the local town boss hogs, they love him.
[01:42:59.554 --> 01:43:03.295]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[01:43:03.415 --> 01:43:13.279]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:19.281]  They have been a long-time sponsor of ours.
[01:43:19.461 --> 01:43:22.962]  Cal Bend Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[01:43:23.302 --> 01:43:25.443]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[01:43:25.863 --> 01:43:30.805]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.

[01:44:06.184 --> 01:44:08.105]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:44:08.485 --> 01:44:16.149]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:44:16.829 --> 01:44:23.873]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:44:24.273 --> 01:44:31.157]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:44:31.644 --> 01:44:35.747]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:44:36.007 --> 01:44:39.550]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:44:39.970 --> 01:44:41.891]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:44:42.231 --> 01:44:46.154]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:44:59.571 --> 01:45:00.052]  We're good to go.
[01:45:25.111 --> 01:45:25.571]  I think so.
[01:45:42.088 --> 01:45:43.049]  We're good to go.
[01:46:08.798 --> 01:46:14.262]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:46:14.282 --> 01:46:19.485]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:46:19.705 --> 01:46:22.227]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[01:46:22.427 --> 01:46:24.909]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:30.152]  We fired once more and they began to running on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:46:32.992 --> 01:46:37.114]  We're gonna open the phones up in the next hour on any issue you wish to discuss at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:46:37.154 --> 01:46:42.336]  William Lewis, the director of Camp FEMA, available right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:46:58.424 --> 01:47:02.866]  We also have it discounted when you get it, when you pre-order it with the film coming out in just about a week and a half.
[01:47:03.366 --> 01:47:04.847]  And that, of course, is Fall of the Republic.
[01:47:04.887 --> 01:47:06.448]  I'm so excited about this documentary.
[01:47:07.448 --> 01:47:17.253]  William, your comments on the mercenaries, your comments on this story, of how when they even knew he was a fraud and a scam and wanted to police the locals, they just said, big deal, so what?
[01:47:17.273 --> 01:47:23.336]  I mean, it's just, we have this criminal class in control of our local governments and our federal government.
[01:47:24.150 --> 01:47:26.431]  And it's just going to get worse and worse until we realize this.
[01:47:26.511 --> 01:47:31.094]  Government is not a license to steal for all the boss hog scum that runs it.
[01:47:32.354 --> 01:47:48.903]  Well, all those people are, you know, more than happy to participate in this policing program and be under the, you know, the control of Mr. Culver, but I doubt very many of those people would feel the same way if he were allowed to carry through with this plan.
[01:47:49.604 --> 01:47:51.044]  I was reading an article by D.B.
[01:47:51.125 --> 01:47:51.325]  Kidd
[01:47:52.478 --> 01:47:53.761]  I'm good to go.
[01:48:05.570 --> 01:48:07.091]  Well, what the locals do...
[01:48:34.568 --> 01:48:36.049]  And I want to be clear, we have footage of this.
[01:48:36.969 --> 01:48:41.491]  We're walking down Main Street, every other car stops, people are running up, they're fans of the show.
[01:48:42.731 --> 01:48:52.255]  We run into some great people in Hardin, but then the small minority of fat cats, they would run up and say, you say there's barricades and that flu's been released here.
[01:48:52.695 --> 01:48:53.636]  We would never say that.
[01:48:54.736 --> 01:48:56.157]  Our guest would bring up the point
[01:48:57.476 --> 01:48:58.617]  Of course.
[01:49:16.115 --> 01:49:16.595]  We're good to go.
[01:49:36.106 --> 01:49:37.086]  But see, that didn't work.
[01:49:37.626 --> 01:49:39.947]  The Attorney General, the FBI's after him now.
[01:49:40.307 --> 01:49:41.667]  Their crap didn't work.
[01:49:41.707 --> 01:49:47.148]  So what these hucksters do in every case is they just throw out, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:49:47.168 --> 01:49:55.310]  But if somebody's walking out of your house with your TV set and your family jewels, you know, you know they're robbing you.
[01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:57.530]  It doesn't matter if they call you a conspiracy theorist.
[01:49:57.771 --> 01:49:59.371]  That doesn't work at a certain point.
[01:49:59.411 --> 01:49:59.731]  Go ahead.
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:10.042]  I was just going to say, this is nothing new that the media is doing, and those are the same terms that they've used over and over again, you know, several years ago when we put out 9-1-1 in plain sight.
[01:50:11.101 --> 01:50:19.305]  The Beck, Beck called us up to go on his program and we had Dave go on with a photograph that he was supposed to be able to show on air.
[01:50:19.725 --> 01:50:31.151]  And before Dave could even get a chance to, you know, provide some information and some examination, Glenn Beck calls him some kind of a 3F51 freak in comparison to an Elvis sighting.
[01:50:31.171 --> 01:50:33.892]  You know, he's seen Elvis out in the desert at Area 51.
[01:50:34.012 --> 01:50:35.313]  No, but that's what they do.
[01:50:35.393 --> 01:50:38.995]  They just made up that I said space aliens were there in the newspaper.
[01:50:41.257 --> 01:50:43.298]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:50:56.043 --> 01:51:00.385]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:51:00.605 --> 01:51:06.208]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:51:06.508 --> 01:51:10.992]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:51:11.272 --> 01:51:14.314]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:51:14.895 --> 01:51:19.298]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:51:19.719 --> 01:51:26.004]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:51:26.284 --> 01:51:28.226]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:51:28.706 --> 01:51:31.527]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[01:51:39.810 --> 01:51:40.810]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:40.830 --> 01:51:42.111]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:19.043]  Gary Franchi, the producer and the director, and Lewis, join us, Camp FEMA.
[01:52:19.223 --> 01:52:21.724]  We're going to be going to your phone calls right now.
[01:52:21.744 --> 01:52:24.605]  In fact, who's up next here on my list?
[01:52:24.685 --> 01:52:25.545]  Matthew in Oregon?
[01:52:26.765 --> 01:52:30.147]  Matthew in Oregon, then Nelson, Anthony, Kurt, Scott, and others.
[01:52:30.167 --> 01:52:32.047]  You're on the air with the makers of Camp FEMA.
[01:52:32.407 --> 01:52:34.108]  If they can speak about any issue, go ahead.
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:50.486]  Yes, my name is Matthew McDaniel, and I'm a human rights activist for the Aka people in Thailand, and currently I'm riding a horse across the United States from Salem, Oregon, and I'm about 10 miles west of Weatherford near Dallas.
[01:52:51.547 --> 01:52:57.589]  And I'm just amazed when I go through these small towns in Texas, post-Texas,
[01:52:59.418 --> 01:53:05.446]  Snyder, Texas, and Hanson, Texas, and I asked the little old lady, I said, hey, what's that uniform you got on?
[01:53:05.506 --> 01:53:07.408]  And she said, oh, it's a prison uniform.
[01:53:07.428 --> 01:53:09.030]  I work at the prison.
[01:53:09.671 --> 01:53:11.013]  I said, what, you got a prison here?
[01:53:11.033 --> 01:53:12.555]  She said, yeah, it's just outside of town.
[01:53:12.615 --> 01:53:13.856]  I said, well, what do you think of that?
[01:53:14.317 --> 01:53:15.679]  She said, well, it's good for jobs.
[01:53:16.824 --> 01:53:24.768]  And, uh, I wonder if, like, you know, they're using these small, falling-apart communities for, uh, putting prisons in, and nobody can see them.
[01:53:25.408 --> 01:53:30.571]  And it's not gonna, it's not gonna get better, it's getting worse, and that's why they're passing laws.
[01:53:31.011 --> 01:53:36.433]  Go to jail for selling eggs, go to jail for garage sales, go to jail for babysitting neighbors' kids.
[01:53:36.674 --> 01:53:45.858]  They're making everything criminal, and then telling neighbors to spy on neighbors because they've admitted the new economy is gonna be in prison or managing the prison.
[01:53:46.718 --> 01:53:54.363]  Well, did you see the article that said they're going to start fining bloggers if they put misinformation on their blog site?
[01:53:54.903 --> 01:53:56.224]  Yes, I forgot to cover that.
[01:53:56.264 --> 01:53:58.785]  A government agency is going to fine you.
[01:53:58.845 --> 01:54:01.327]  It's going to decide what's true and what isn't.
[01:54:01.987 --> 01:54:08.211]  And absolutely, in the State Department, yes, they, and they're going to have a message that pops up saying your site's not accurate.
[01:54:08.852 --> 01:54:15.436]  I mean, if you say that Iraq didn't have WMDs, they're going to say you're evil and fine you, because everybody knows they had nukes.
[01:54:17.503 --> 01:54:24.332]  You have on your website one of my videos from with the Akha people in Northern Thailand.
[01:54:25.093 --> 01:54:26.615]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:54:26.635 --> 01:54:32.563]  When you mention those people, yeah they come and force them, tetanus shot after tetanus shot, till they have the miscarriage.
[01:54:32.963 --> 01:54:34.666]  So you're the guy that shot those videos?
[01:54:35.239 --> 01:54:35.959]  Right, that's me.
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:53.150]  I documented women who said I was forced to have three tetanus toxoid vaccinations during one pregnancy and when I was nine months pregnant I got the vaccination and the same day the baby stopped moving and the baby came out about eight hours later.
[01:54:54.261 --> 01:55:02.826]  Yeah, you have woman after woman, and the UN has been caught, the UN has been caught sterilizing people through the shots.
[01:55:02.886 --> 01:55:05.467]  Yeah, you're only supposed to get one tetanus shot every seven years.
[01:55:05.727 --> 01:55:11.931]  They give the women three special ones, but they found the tetanus is good to bind the female hormone to, to cause the miscarriage.
[01:55:12.191 --> 01:55:21.776]  That's what the UN's been, so they're murdering babies, which is what this calls for, forced abortion, White House science are, and you're the guy I'd like to have you on as a guest.
[01:55:22.932 --> 01:55:42.658]  Well, the thing is, they're focusing it on the minorities, like the Aka Hill Tribe, and we have all these videos on aka.org, but they're focusing on the Hill Tribe because, you know, I'd ask the nurses, you know, wait, you have a tetanus shot every seven years, why are you making the women come in for three shots during each pregnancy?
[01:55:43.438 --> 01:55:47.039]  And they're telling the women, if you don't, then there's no ID card for your baby.
[01:55:47.439 --> 01:55:49.179]  That's right, no welfare, no money.
[01:55:49.219 --> 01:55:51.020]  Yeah, they use the welfare to get to kill them, yeah.
[01:55:53.459 --> 01:56:02.461]  And so, what we're doing now is we're doing a national protest march about the human rights conditions of the Akhas by going across the U.S.
[01:56:02.501 --> 01:56:03.242]  by horseback.
[01:56:03.282 --> 01:56:07.083]  My wife, she's Akha, and we've got five little kids in a bus that says, Ride for Freedom.
[01:56:08.043 --> 01:56:22.567]  And, you know, the other thing we've got a big problem with is all these American missionaries going to Northern Thailand and taking away Akha kids and telling their churches that they're orphans if you want to see a big fraud in action.
[01:56:24.178 --> 01:56:26.380]  Well, child kidnapping is what America does.
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:29.182]  We kidnap our own kids, we kidnap everybody else's kids.
[01:56:29.622 --> 01:56:32.524]  Hell, they're lucky they just don't go to Iraq and just murder everybody.
[01:56:32.544 --> 01:56:33.405]  I mean, that's what we do.
[01:56:33.785 --> 01:56:39.750]  We poison our own people, we murder everybody, and we make TV ads celebrating ourselves, saying how good we are.
[01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:41.891]  Sir, I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:56:41.931 --> 01:56:42.972]  Give me your name and info.
[01:56:42.992 --> 01:56:44.654]  I recognize your voice from the videos.
[01:56:45.054 --> 01:56:45.835]  Great job you're doing.
[01:56:45.855 --> 01:56:49.318]  We should have you on sometime from the landline about what's going on there.
[01:56:49.338 --> 01:56:52.961]  We're going to come back with Gary Franchi and William Lewis of Camp FEMA.
[01:56:52.981 --> 01:56:56.284]  Continue talking about their film, Camp FEMA, American Lockdown.
[01:56:56.324 --> 01:56:57.925]  Available at Infowars.com.
[01:56:57.965 --> 01:56:58.366]  Stay with us.
[01:56:59.738 --> 01:57:02.341]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:57:02.761 --> 01:57:07.726]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:57:08.086 --> 01:57:09.828]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:57:10.128 --> 01:57:14.953]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:57:15.133 --> 01:57:16.054]  How much do you want?
[01:57:16.314 --> 01:57:17.055]  When do you want it?
[01:57:17.435 --> 01:57:19.036]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:57:19.316 --> 01:57:20.137]  When will you need it?
[01:57:20.397 --> 01:57:22.458]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:57:22.598 --> 01:57:23.699]  Will there be any food?
[01:57:23.939 --> 01:57:25.260]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:30.524]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:57:30.724 --> 01:57:33.906]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:57:34.306 --> 01:57:37.789]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:57:38.129 --> 01:57:39.109]  How much will you need?
[01:57:39.349 --> 01:57:39.970]  We don't know.
[01:57:40.250 --> 01:57:41.150]  How much do you want?
[01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:42.090]  All you can get.
[01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:43.131]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:43.371 --> 01:57:46.152]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:57:46.432 --> 01:57:48.613]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:57:48.633 --> 01:57:49.633]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:03.887]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:04.047 --> 01:58:05.970]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:58:06.110 --> 01:58:08.413]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:58:08.573 --> 01:58:10.416]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:58:10.836 --> 01:58:12.198]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:58:12.478 --> 01:58:13.500]  There is a solution.
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:21.742]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:58:35.646 --> 01:58:41.228]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:58:41.668 --> 01:58:45.469]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:04.674]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[01:59:05.214 --> 01:59:09.856]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[01:59:10.356 --> 01:59:10.936]  That was then.
[01:59:10.956 --> 01:59:12.217]  This is now.
[01:59:12.857 --> 01:59:15.038]  Introducing Diginet Spy Sunglasses.
[01:59:15.578 --> 01:59:21.223]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[01:59:21.643 --> 01:59:30.490]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[01:59:30.851 --> 01:59:33.613]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[01:59:34.313 --> 01:59:38.276]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[01:59:38.797 --> 01:59:39.818]  Video never lies.
[01:59:40.298 --> 01:59:41.459]  Watch Big Brother back.
[01:59:41.959 --> 01:59:43.420]  Visit diginet.net.

[01:59:49.345 --> 01:59:50.486]  Diginet dot net.
[01:59:51.006 --> 01:59:51.486]  Or call 1-888-344-6681.
[01:59:51.506 --> 01:59:51.707]  1-888-344-6681 today.
[02:00:00.965 --> 02:00:06.992]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:00:07.592 --> 02:00:10.576]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:29.932 --> 02:00:39.260]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and we're continuing taking your phone calls with Gary Franchi and, of course, the director of the film, William Lewis Camp, FEMA.
[02:00:40.641 --> 02:00:45.725]  Guys, shifting gears, they have all these different excuses to set up a police state.
[02:00:46.065 --> 02:00:48.007]  Shadowy men want to kill you overseas.
[02:00:48.027 --> 02:00:49.288]  We've got to set up homeland security.
[02:00:49.568 --> 02:00:52.410]  Then we get the documents, homeland security set up for the American people.
[02:00:53.511 --> 02:00:57.073]  Alex, you know, I just got an email here from one of your listeners.
[02:01:15.504 --> 02:01:24.987]  And he says that he was one of the early birds who pre-ordered Camp FIMA, considering that this kind of subject matter can be difficult to present in a way that can be digested by ordinary people.
[02:01:26.007 --> 02:01:30.668]  He thought that it would be another movie that could not only show, he could only show a small percentage of his friends.
[02:01:31.568 --> 02:01:38.430]  But he says, after watching Camp FIMA, he says, I'd like to give you both the very highest acknowledgement for making a truly great film.
[02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:41.071]  Your presentation is methodical, easy to follow.
[02:01:41.795 --> 02:01:42.355]  Thank you so much.
[02:01:42.375 --> 02:01:44.736]  I hope to be going and getting more copies soon to show to friends.
[02:02:07.383 --> 02:02:13.165]  Well, you know, that's what I made the Obama deception to do, is to shatter the left-right paradigm, to show people how both parties are controlled.
[02:02:13.466 --> 02:02:16.247]  And you do this in a matter-of-fact, like mainline television.
[02:02:16.547 --> 02:02:19.608]  Here's the history of FEMA, here's Congress, here's what they're doing.
[02:02:19.628 --> 02:02:26.591]  They admit the camps, because they admit it out of one side of their mouth, but in a good light, and then deny it when we say we don't want camps.
[02:02:27.071 --> 02:02:28.292]  And so you really expose that.
[02:02:28.332 --> 02:02:28.812]  Continue.
[02:02:32.150 --> 02:02:34.131]  I would say it's not an easy topic to cover.
[02:02:34.431 --> 02:02:34.911]  William, go ahead.
[02:02:35.472 --> 02:02:41.915]  Oh, I just wanted to point out that, you know, we break the film down into FEMA's three basic prime directives.
[02:02:42.695 --> 02:02:47.777]  Their directive number one is national emergency recovery, like tornadoes, floods, earthquakes.
[02:02:47.797 --> 02:02:51.939]  We go in and take a look at how they've done at those jobs in the past and give them a grade.
[02:02:52.519 --> 02:02:55.761]  And then we go in and look at their other directive, which is continuity of government.
[02:02:56.241 --> 02:02:56.762]  We're good to go.
[02:03:20.529 --> 02:03:37.634]  The existing social and political order and the threat that they perceive to it is listed throughout the documentation that we found in Senate Select Committee hearings, FBI documentation, and this mimics what we see in the Department of Homeland Security report and the MIAC reports.
[02:03:38.054 --> 02:03:39.454]  So this is nothing new.
[02:03:39.514 --> 02:03:45.036]  It's just laid out in a way where people can, for the first time, put those puzzle pieces together in a way that makes sense.
[02:03:50.251 --> 02:03:52.172]  So, what do we do about the FEMA camps?
[02:03:54.154 --> 02:03:58.416]  I mean, they're just building this whole infrastructure, turning our whole society into a prison.
[02:03:58.697 --> 02:04:00.518]  It's all admitted, but they're still in denial.
[02:04:02.799 --> 02:04:04.060]  We have to resist at every corner.
[02:04:05.361 --> 02:04:06.542]  We have to resist at every corner.
[02:04:06.762 --> 02:04:07.442]  Critical mass.
[02:04:07.942 --> 02:04:08.763]  Spreading information.
[02:04:08.843 --> 02:04:10.804]  Alex, it's about waking up the people.
[02:04:12.325 --> 02:04:13.506]  That's the bottom line.
[02:04:13.746 --> 02:04:18.909]  You know, without an informed populace, you know, and without winning the court of public opinion, we're going to lose this battle.
[02:04:20.507 --> 02:04:25.211]  I commend you, Alex, for the work you're doing, for the films you're putting out, for the message you're hitting home to people.
[02:04:26.472 --> 02:04:36.821]  It's a collective effort across a spectrum of the movement to wake up the American people, to get us organized, to get us activated and taking back this country.
[02:04:37.662 --> 02:04:38.382]  That's what we've got to do.
[02:04:47.392 --> 02:04:56.755]  All I know is, it's clear that we have a criminal establishment in control, setting up a scientific dictatorship, and things are only going to get worse until people say no.
[02:04:57.475 --> 02:05:05.458]  The biggest issue is the worship of police, the worship of surveillance in the media, as if these are the modern heroes, greater than Michael Jordan, greater than John Wayne.
[02:05:06.318 --> 02:05:07.258]  I mean, it's really sick.
[02:05:08.058 --> 02:05:08.899]  It's predatory.
[02:05:09.279 --> 02:05:12.140]  There's all these reports of police robbing people all over the country.
[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:13.020]  Don't even get in trouble.
[02:05:14.634 --> 02:05:20.236]  I know they're a good police, but they're mainly used as the cover by the corrupt system itself to continue operating.
[02:05:21.777 --> 02:05:29.440]  Well, you know, up in Canada, there was a friend of mine who uncovered a drug smuggling operation by the Ontario police named Scott Loper.
[02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:37.263]  You know, they threw him into a prison, they tortured him for 40 years, and never provided him access to the embassy or the State Department.
[02:05:37.603 --> 02:05:39.063]  Violated international treaty.
[02:05:39.704 --> 02:05:42.185]  So, I mean, the corruption is worldwide, Alex, and you know this.
[02:05:47.827 --> 02:05:49.068]  Continue along that line.
[02:05:49.988 --> 02:05:53.351]  Well, okay, you know, Scott was a police officer.
[02:05:53.491 --> 02:06:01.836]  He investigated criminal activities in New Jersey, moved up to Canada, discovered a drug smuggling operation.
[02:06:02.597 --> 02:06:05.438]  His family was taken away from him, trumped up charges.
[02:06:05.498 --> 02:06:06.659]  His child was abducted.
[02:06:06.999 --> 02:06:08.280]  They still don't know where the kid is.
[02:06:09.141 --> 02:06:12.243]  And now he's fighting the State Department to get justice.
[02:06:12.463 --> 02:06:13.864]  The State Department's denying him.
[02:06:14.781 --> 02:06:16.244]  I mean, all the documents are there.
[02:06:16.805 --> 02:06:18.728]  Check it out at ScottLoperStory.com.
[02:06:19.429 --> 02:06:21.032]  It's a horrible thing.
[02:06:21.052 --> 02:06:24.337]  And just one man trying to get justice.
[02:06:25.018 --> 02:06:26.441]  Trying to expose corruption.
[02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:41.214]  Well, when the history's written on all this, for better or worse, it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.
[02:06:41.574 --> 02:06:42.995]  People are gonna wish they'd done more.
[02:06:43.055 --> 02:06:56.463]  I mean, when they're openly announcing no free speech in America, and they won't issue permits, first they say you gotta have a permit that turns a right into a privilege, then they start not issuing the permits, just like they did with gun permits in New York City.
[02:06:57.064 --> 02:06:59.205]  I mean, this is hardcore tyranny.
[02:06:59.225 --> 02:07:00.286]  This is communist China.
[02:07:01.827 --> 02:07:03.268]  Well, it is, Alex.
[02:07:04.463 --> 02:07:08.145]  It's up to the people, you know, to stand up to this tyranny.
[02:07:08.305 --> 02:07:25.636]  You know, when I look at my children or my grandchildren in the future, I want to say that I fought for freedom, that I fought for America, that I fought so that they could be raised and live in a world, live in an America where freedom is not a slogan, it's not a catchphrase, but it's an actual reality that we can embrace.
[02:07:26.314 --> 02:07:28.015]  And that's what I fight for every day, Alex.
[02:07:28.375 --> 02:07:35.497]  That's why we put out these films, magazines, websites, webinars, whatever it may be, to push the message forward, to organize the people.
[02:07:35.977 --> 02:07:38.158]  Because I'm not going to sit back and say, I did nothing.
[02:07:39.098 --> 02:07:40.579]  I'm going to fight for this country, Alex.
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:46.461]  Let's take some calls here.
[02:07:46.541 --> 02:07:50.742]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Nelson in California.
[02:07:51.183 --> 02:07:52.183]  Nelson, you're on the air.
[02:07:53.248 --> 02:07:54.069]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[02:07:54.089 --> 02:07:57.151]  This is my third time calling and I'm from We Are Change LA.
[02:07:58.371 --> 02:08:04.875]  I was calling in regards to a previous caller who was talking about the new Michael Moore movie.
[02:08:04.895 --> 02:08:08.998]  I actually went and saw it and it was pretty bad.
[02:08:10.519 --> 02:08:18.584]  Really bad, but I made a spoof poster and I sent it to you through your advertising link.
[02:08:19.004 --> 02:08:21.446]  I don't know if you got it, but I made a spoof where I
[02:08:22.259 --> 02:08:26.262]  Changed Michael Moore into you heckling at him with your bullhorn.
[02:08:27.023 --> 02:08:35.789]  And the other thing I connected was that Michael Moore's talent agent is Rahm Emanuel's brother, Ari Emanuel.
[02:08:36.410 --> 02:08:37.931]  I don't know if you're aware of that, were you?
[02:08:39.625 --> 02:08:43.926]  Yes, but I mean, I'm not defending Michael Moore because he's anti-Second Amendment.
[02:08:44.606 --> 02:08:48.548]  He's saying corporate system, the capitalism did this.
[02:08:48.628 --> 02:08:51.208]  This is just corporate robbery that did this.
[02:08:51.468 --> 02:08:54.149]  His answer of communism is what the elites want.
[02:08:54.189 --> 02:08:56.030]  They take our wealth and give it to themselves.
[02:08:56.790 --> 02:09:00.271]  But he's one of the biggest agents in Hollywood.
[02:09:01.149 --> 02:09:03.670]  And so, yeah, you're going to have people like that involved.
[02:09:03.730 --> 02:09:06.011]  Yes, I have seen that in the news.
[02:09:06.612 --> 02:09:12.194]  And yes, he's got a whole agenda pushing government health care, seizing 20 percent of what's left of the market.
[02:09:12.735 --> 02:09:18.418]  Of course, the insurance companies are corrupt, too, because they've used government regulation to allow that corruption.
[02:09:18.658 --> 02:09:22.660]  Before government got involved 50 years ago, we were the apple of the world's eye.
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:26.461]  So we need less government, not more government.
[02:09:29.053 --> 02:09:39.142]  And you've got Rahm Emanuel's other brother is advising the White House on the death panels and openly gives speeches about the case for getting rid of Granny.
[02:09:40.003 --> 02:09:41.404]  And so yeah, it's pretty creepy.
[02:09:41.444 --> 02:09:42.225]  I appreciate your call.
[02:09:42.505 --> 02:09:48.531]  There's all these interconnections in this whole power structure, isn't there, Gary Franchi and Mr. Lewis?
[02:09:49.778 --> 02:09:50.518]  Oh, without question.
[02:09:50.778 --> 02:09:53.940]  And, you know, in the mainstream media, it's so frightening.
[02:09:55.060 --> 02:10:01.143]  I just got a report that Camp FEMA was hand-delivered to Glenn Beck at a recent book signing.
[02:10:02.223 --> 02:10:07.105]  You know, and there is a special segment on Glenn Beck, as you know, Alex, in the film.
[02:10:08.046 --> 02:10:12.868]  So, we anticipate something coming out of Glenn Beck if he even decides to watch the film.
[02:10:13.568 --> 02:10:15.289]  But when the film was handed to him,
[02:10:16.092 --> 02:10:20.053]  He was told that the film was made in response to his message.
[02:10:20.933 --> 02:10:24.074]  So, should be interesting to see what... You know what's sad about Glenn Beck?
[02:10:24.574 --> 02:10:26.334]  You know, Muse are fans of the show.
[02:10:27.574 --> 02:10:29.755]  The lead singer, main songwriter is Mr. Bellamy.
[02:10:29.775 --> 02:10:30.555]  He's been on the show.
[02:10:32.275 --> 02:10:35.736]  And, uh... We've inspired their work.
[02:10:36.296 --> 02:10:39.176]  We've inspired Megadeth and a lot of other groups.
[02:10:41.217 --> 02:10:42.197]  But the issue is...
[02:10:43.857 --> 02:10:52.703]  That Beck came out last week and endorsed it and said he loved the message and they said, remove your endorsement, you're an establishment lackey trying to co-opt our movement.
[02:10:53.124 --> 02:10:56.966]  So the good news is, anybody with half a brain knows that Beck's a phony.
[02:10:57.006 --> 02:11:04.131]  He does a lot of good work, but he only does that to get you under his control, so he can then deny key issues.
[02:11:04.191 --> 02:11:08.895]  Remember, when Ron Paul had a chance of winning, it was Glenn Beck sunking, more than anybody.
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:15.665]  And now that Ron Paul can't become president right now, he loves him.
[02:11:15.785 --> 02:11:18.268]  He is a Judas Iscariot, he is a Benedict Arnold.
[02:11:18.588 --> 02:11:24.193]  Well, gentlemen, I want to commend you on the film, Camp FEMA, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:24.213 --> 02:11:26.475]  I hope everybody gets it, shows it to their friends and family.
[02:11:26.495 --> 02:11:31.420]  You can also call toll-free to get it, 888-253-3139.
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:35.163]  While you're calling, you can also order Fall of the Republic, that ships in
[02:11:36.124 --> 02:11:39.106]  What are we talking about, 15 days here or earlier?
[02:11:39.427 --> 02:11:42.169]  Comes out October 21st, 888-253-3139.
[02:11:42.409 --> 02:11:49.294]  I want to thank both of you for the great job you've done and we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:11:49.354 --> 02:11:50.755]  Thank you, Gary Franchi and William Lewis.
[02:11:53.277 --> 02:11:56.700]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with financial news, more fluid news and your phone calls.
[02:11:59.813 --> 02:12:03.476]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:12:03.876 --> 02:12:09.300]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:12:09.781 --> 02:12:10.862]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:12:10.882 --> 02:12:14.925]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:12:15.585 --> 02:12:28.894]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:12:29.394 --> 02:12:34.698]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:12:34.998 --> 02:12:40.822]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:12:41.642 --> 02:12:42.984]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:12:43.004 --> 02:12:44.607]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:12:44.627 --> 02:12:44.967]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:12:45.047 --> 02:12:47.070]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:47.151]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:12:59.153 --> 02:13:01.174]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:13:01.314 --> 02:13:03.695]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:13:03.715 --> 02:13:05.836]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:13:05.976 --> 02:13:07.536]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:13:07.576 --> 02:13:09.157]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:13:09.257 --> 02:13:12.078]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[02:13:12.098 --> 02:13:17.340]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the UNICEF?
[02:13:25.429 --> 02:13:30.291]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:13:34.096 --> 02:13:35.157]  How dare you?
[02:13:35.357 --> 02:13:41.599]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:13:41.619 --> 02:13:44.420]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:13:44.501 --> 02:13:50.943]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[02:13:50.963 --> 02:13:53.524]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[02:13:53.804 --> 02:13:55.825]  Or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[02:13:56.085 --> 02:13:58.607]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:13:59.147 --> 02:14:02.068]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:14:04.264 --> 02:14:04.845]  We're good to go.
[02:14:20.469 --> 02:14:20.749]  We're good.
[02:14:48.883 --> 02:14:51.627]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:14:51.647 --> 02:14:52.268]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[02:15:00.609 --> 02:15:01.790]  Remain in your houses.
[02:15:02.611 --> 02:15:07.776]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[02:15:08.377 --> 02:15:09.358]  Will they do it?
[02:15:09.738 --> 02:15:11.720]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[02:15:12.361 --> 02:15:18.387]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[02:15:18.827 --> 02:15:20.089]  Think it can't happen here?
[02:15:21.009 --> 02:15:24.532]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[02:15:25.293 --> 02:15:29.577]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[02:15:30.177 --> 02:15:34.441]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[02:15:35.081 --> 02:15:39.906]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[02:15:40.826 --> 02:15:48.953]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[02:15:49.233 --> 02:15:51.515]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[02:15:51.735 --> 02:15:54.637]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[02:15:54.798 --> 02:15:57.740]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[02:16:06.907 --> 02:16:07.828]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:16:07.868 --> 02:16:09.810]  I want to continue with your phone calls.
[02:16:14.494 --> 02:16:21.716]  More and more, I'm sitting there listening to her last guest, and I'm thinking, why are we having to even fight FEMA camps?
[02:16:21.896 --> 02:16:24.436]  Why are we even having to fight mercenaries?
[02:16:25.016 --> 02:16:28.857]  Why are we even having to deal with face scanning cameras and AP headlines?
[02:16:29.397 --> 02:16:32.877]  National police chiefs call for neighbors to spy on neighbors.
[02:16:33.398 --> 02:16:41.679]  And then I'm in Billings, Montana, and the third floor elevator opens, and it's police and homeland security banners with hundreds of Girl Scouts.
[02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:46.272]  And I step out of the elevator dazed.
[02:16:46.352 --> 02:16:49.193]  I mean, you know, it's so insane.
[02:16:50.114 --> 02:16:51.274]  It's so evil.
[02:16:52.855 --> 02:17:00.839]  And these crazy cops and crazy spies and crazy un-American people will go, we're stopping drugs, we're stopping terrorists.
[02:17:01.359 --> 02:17:07.082]  When you stage the terror in almost every case, when you ship the drugs in, it's all on record.
[02:17:07.142 --> 02:17:08.443]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:17:09.003 --> 02:17:10.104]  Leave me alone.
[02:17:12.383 --> 02:17:19.233]  I already don't go downtown Austin hardly ever to eat even though they got good restaurants down there because I don't want to be around the thug downtown cops.
[02:17:20.214 --> 02:17:23.479]  What am I going to do when they say now they take blood randomly at checkpoints?
[02:17:23.499 --> 02:17:27.284]  They're announcing in Canada and England they're going to randomly take breathalyzers and blood.
[02:17:27.464 --> 02:17:28.125]  Randomly!
[02:17:29.028 --> 02:17:32.189]  What do I do when the cop goes, I'm going to stick a needle in your arm, boy?
[02:17:32.249 --> 02:17:39.151]  I mean, it's just they keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing.
[02:17:39.211 --> 02:17:52.914]  And they work for offshore banks that are openly killing the dollar, that have openly doubled the credit card rates to 30%, who are openly setting up world government and are going to tax carbon dioxide.
[02:17:54.417 --> 02:17:55.818]  We've been tracking gold today.
[02:17:55.938 --> 02:18:02.461]  It's broke the all-time record by over $10 of over $1,041 today.
[02:18:02.481 --> 02:18:02.881]  $1,041 today.
[02:18:02.901 --> 02:18:06.763]  I haven't looked at it in the last hour.
[02:18:06.783 --> 02:18:08.524]  I wanted to briefly have Ted Anderson come in.
[02:18:09.345 --> 02:18:11.906]  Midas Resources, 30 years in the gold and silver business.
[02:18:14.067 --> 02:18:14.827]  Ted's had Midas for 12.
[02:18:15.748 --> 02:18:17.249]  Ted, what is going on right now?
[02:18:17.989 --> 02:18:20.110]  Well, I'm watching the market just like you are, Alex.
[02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:22.211]  I mean, the market right now is sitting at $1,040 and change.
[02:18:24.605 --> 02:18:30.527]  The sellers have tried to bring the prices down into the $1,030 range, but it keeps bouncing right back up again.
[02:18:31.087 --> 02:18:34.148]  This all started in the middle of the night while we were sleeping.
[02:18:34.749 --> 02:18:43.992]  The Arab countries decided to join in with this UN thing to bring down the United States dollar and go to a basket of currencies.
[02:18:44.552 --> 02:18:48.293]  And since then, the dollar has just been plummeting and gold has been going up.
[02:18:48.971 --> 02:18:54.792]  And we've seen a high of 1,044 now today, and it's been very strong.
[02:18:54.872 --> 02:19:00.333]  I mean, I gotta tell you, I'm really happy to see that there's a lot of people taking advantage of the offers we have right now.
[02:19:00.713 --> 02:19:02.874]  I mean, people are finally coming to their senses.
[02:19:03.934 --> 02:19:09.035]  I hate to have to motivate people by fear, because they should be using their head.
[02:19:09.555 --> 02:19:11.255]  But, you know, here's the thing.
[02:19:11.575 --> 02:19:12.616]  Here's the news story.
[02:19:12.816 --> 02:19:14.436]  The United States dollar's in trouble.
[02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:23.028]  And there's nothing really that we can do about it because we've gone so far into debt that we rely on foreign nations in order to finance our economy.
[02:19:23.548 --> 02:19:31.196]  And now we're watching the dollar fall in value because of the foreigners that have been financing this for us are deciding they don't want to have any more of it.
[02:19:31.576 --> 02:19:37.302]  They want to sell the debt that they already have, the loans that they've already given us, which means the dollar falls.
[02:19:37.862 --> 02:19:39.905]  I mean, that's just simply it, man.
[02:19:40.285 --> 02:19:46.031]  If you're sitting in the bank, if you have money in the stock market, if you're looking at anything that has to do with U.S.
[02:19:46.071 --> 02:19:58.966]  currency, man, all I can say is you better take a real serious look at what you have, because before this is done, we could be like Argentina, where you're sitting at 40% of your value of what you had just a year ago.
[02:20:00.687 --> 02:20:11.011]  They were a nation's superpower back in the day, and then all of a sudden they went into this deficit spiral, and now their currency is almost worthless.
[02:20:11.891 --> 02:20:13.572]  And that's what the United States is doing.
[02:20:13.632 --> 02:20:14.612]  It's just identical.
[02:20:15.052 --> 02:20:16.714]  I mean, that's not the only country.
[02:20:16.754 --> 02:20:19.336]  I mean, look at Mexico, Argentina, Brazil.
[02:20:20.237 --> 02:20:21.278]  There's Venezuela.
[02:20:21.879 --> 02:20:24.301]  There's countries in Africa, obviously.
[02:20:24.341 --> 02:20:27.804]  I mean, the world doesn't want the United States dollar anymore.
[02:20:27.845 --> 02:20:30.327]  They don't want to be dominated by the United States anymore.
[02:20:30.347 --> 02:20:31.588]  They'd like to get away from that.
[02:20:32.049 --> 02:20:36.733]  And unfortunately, us here as citizens, who have our assets tied up in U.S.
[02:20:36.793 --> 02:20:38.475]  dollar, are going to take the hit.
[02:20:41.016 --> 02:20:41.736]  Absolutely.
[02:20:42.757 --> 02:20:43.817]  Absolutely, Ted.
[02:20:44.297 --> 02:20:45.338]  Where is gold right now?
[02:20:45.818 --> 02:20:48.399]  Well, right now gold is at $1,040 and change.
[02:20:48.419 --> 02:20:49.939]  I looked at it just before I walked in.
[02:20:49.959 --> 02:20:50.279]  It was like $1,040.40.
[02:20:53.100 --> 02:20:57.102]  I can tell you right now, Alex, the stuff that I've accumulated here at that $9.80 to $9.40 level is going to be gone.
[02:21:01.463 --> 02:21:01.963]  And you know what?
[02:21:02.283 --> 02:21:04.964]  My prices, I'm looking at the wholesale prices to me right now.
[02:21:05.024 --> 02:21:07.725]  I have to pay a tremendous amount more for the same stuff.
[02:21:08.205 --> 02:21:09.666]  You know, I can't say it enough.
[02:21:09.806 --> 02:21:12.047]  I really want people to get into gold and silver.
[02:21:12.467 --> 02:21:17.449]  It is a big enough train wreck for everybody in the entire nation to recognize that it's coming now.
[02:21:17.929 --> 02:21:20.430]  Don't mess around with your future.
[02:21:20.490 --> 02:21:21.050]  This is it.
[02:21:21.730 --> 02:21:23.971]  We have the handwriting on the wall.
[02:21:24.011 --> 02:21:26.772]  I don't know how to do it.
[02:21:26.792 --> 02:21:29.093]  Absolutely.
[02:21:29.353 --> 02:21:33.275]  Let me give him the number.
[02:21:33.295 --> 02:21:33.335]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:33.355 --> 02:21:34.355]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:34.416 --> 02:21:41.899]  Ted's running this deal up until 3 o'clock today, I guess when the show ends.
[02:21:41.919 --> 02:21:42.059]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:42.579 --> 02:21:45.460]  Do not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:47.921]  We'll talk to Ted on the other side, if he can hold it a little bit longer.
[02:21:48.301 --> 02:21:49.222]  We'll find out together.
[02:21:49.622 --> 02:21:52.624]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:21:53.545 --> 02:21:56.227]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:59.121 --> 02:22:03.105]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:22:03.365 --> 02:22:05.147]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:22:05.367 --> 02:22:13.655]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:22:13.896 --> 02:22:19.121]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:22:19.441 --> 02:22:21.063]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:22:21.303 --> 02:22:27.625]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:22:27.805 --> 02:22:38.567]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:22:38.847 --> 02:22:39.367]  That's right.
[02:22:39.628 --> 02:22:41.948]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:22:42.188 --> 02:22:43.789]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:22:46.129 --> 02:23:01.113]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[02:23:01.413 --> 02:23:04.854]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:23:05.034 --> 02:23:06.955]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:23:07.235 --> 02:23:10.256]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:23:10.576 --> 02:23:14.377]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[02:23:14.397 --> 02:23:14.657]  I think so.
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:44.560]  We're good.
[02:24:00.336 --> 02:24:05.138]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[02:24:05.498 --> 02:24:05.918]  I'm not.
[02:24:06.038 --> 02:24:06.698]  Don't trust it.
[02:24:06.758 --> 02:24:08.639]  But then I don't want to get the disease either.
[02:24:08.999 --> 02:24:14.461]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[02:24:14.721 --> 02:24:17.182]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[02:24:17.282 --> 02:24:21.343]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[02:24:21.823 --> 02:24:24.544]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[02:24:25.004 --> 02:24:30.431]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[02:24:30.731 --> 02:24:32.653]  That's NoGerms.info.
[02:24:32.994 --> 02:24:41.303]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[02:24:41.544 --> 02:24:42.545]  Don't pick your nose.
[02:24:42.905 --> 02:24:47.188]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[02:24:47.489 --> 02:24:52.392]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[02:24:52.593 --> 02:24:54.294]  Go to no germs dot info.
[02:24:54.354 --> 02:24:56.075]  That's no germs dot info.
[02:24:56.556 --> 02:24:58.077]  Be well and stay well.
[02:24:58.297 --> 02:24:58.857]  Best M.
[02:25:08.973 --> 02:25:10.595]  Pat Anderson is our guest.
[02:25:10.615 --> 02:25:12.418]  We're going to go to your phone calls.
[02:25:13.039 --> 02:25:16.584]  Anthony, Kurt, Scott, Shelly, Laura, and others here in just a moment.
[02:25:17.605 --> 02:25:21.991]  Also, this morning, I've always meant to bring in some of my pen and ink work.
[02:25:23.133 --> 02:25:25.796]  Some of the acrylics I've done, some of the oil paintings I've painted.
[02:25:26.738 --> 02:25:28.539]  Because really, that's what I'm into.
[02:25:29.199 --> 02:25:33.161]  I mean, I'm into deep-sea fishing, deep-sea diving.
[02:25:34.362 --> 02:25:35.623]  I'm into camping.
[02:25:35.903 --> 02:25:37.604]  People always ask what I do, what I like.
[02:25:38.244 --> 02:25:44.287]  And when I talk about it's a weight to have to come in here and fight the New World Order, I've got other things I want to do.
[02:25:45.448 --> 02:25:49.250]  I mean, I would just rather sit out at a farmhouse somewhere
[02:25:50.535 --> 02:26:04.023]  And oil paint, and hike, and grow gardens, and hang out with my children, and quite frankly, write poetry, things like that.
[02:26:04.063 --> 02:26:07.325]  I mean, I don't like having to fight the New World Order all day.
[02:26:07.365 --> 02:26:10.647]  I don't like having to come in here, and I don't relish this.
[02:26:10.687 --> 02:26:11.908]  This is about survival.
[02:26:12.549 --> 02:26:18.052]  This is about standing up for human liberty, so that we can all lead our lives the way we see fit.
[02:26:20.942 --> 02:26:36.098]  I painted a lot until I hit about 25, and I was so busy by then with the radio and TV shows that I've been doing for three, four years by then, that I quit painting, except for oil painting every once in a while, a little bit of watercolor.
[02:26:36.819 --> 02:26:37.960]  But here's one I did.
[02:26:37.980 --> 02:26:42.846]  I was looking online at Japanese
[02:26:44.192 --> 02:26:44.813]  Pen and inks.
[02:26:45.833 --> 02:26:47.455]  This is like a 400-year-old one.
[02:26:49.196 --> 02:26:49.957]  It's my own painting.
[02:26:49.997 --> 02:26:51.558]  I mean, it's a lot different than that one.
[02:26:51.578 --> 02:26:55.001]  It's not even really... It's kind of after that piece.
[02:26:55.262 --> 02:26:56.002]  I forget the name of the piece.
[02:26:56.042 --> 02:26:58.184]  This morning I thought, why not bring a few of my smaller paintings?
[02:26:59.005 --> 02:27:00.546]  This is my own style here.
[02:27:00.566 --> 02:27:10.735]  I can certainly paint with the palette with a thin oil and a veneer and do even more... Let me have a shot from over there.
[02:27:11.115 --> 02:27:11.876]  Do even more...
[02:27:13.342 --> 02:27:14.143]  Detailed work.
[02:27:15.644 --> 02:27:18.027]  But this is really the style that I developed.
[02:27:19.428 --> 02:27:20.910]  It's a thick paint.
[02:27:22.992 --> 02:27:24.013]  Almost three-dimensional.
[02:27:24.133 --> 02:27:25.174]  Well, not almost.
[02:27:25.214 --> 02:27:25.995]  It is three-dimensional.
[02:27:27.216 --> 02:27:31.981]  And so that's a rough seas with a squall, stormy skies.
[02:27:34.141 --> 02:27:35.822]  And I really like this little painting I did.
[02:27:36.382 --> 02:27:37.262]  And then here's another one.
[02:27:37.842 --> 02:27:44.104]  I took this photo when I quit painting, right around the time I quit painting, when I was about 24, 25, of some sunflowers.
[02:27:44.164 --> 02:27:46.025]  My parents live on three and a half acres in town.
[02:27:46.345 --> 02:27:55.568]  They had a big sunflower grove and I cut a bunch of sunflowers and some other wildflowers and stuck them in a green vase and took a photo on my parents' table and meant to paint it.
[02:27:56.008 --> 02:27:57.709]  And that's why I started painting again about a year ago.
[02:27:57.729 --> 02:27:59.609]  I was digging through stuff and found this old photo.
[02:27:59.629 --> 02:28:01.310]  So this was the first painting I did.
[02:28:06.039 --> 02:28:15.465]  After, uh, you can call it whatever style you want, but there are the oil paintings of Alex Jones.
[02:28:15.485 --> 02:28:18.426]  In fact, I'll give you a better shot over there so people can really look at it.
[02:28:19.747 --> 02:28:26.231]  But I wanted to show people that little glimpse into my mind, what I'm into, for people that are interested.
[02:28:27.692 --> 02:28:30.933]  Because, you know, I'd rather be admiring mountain vistas, I'd rather be
[02:28:32.515 --> 02:28:33.096]  Rock hunting.
[02:28:33.156 --> 02:28:34.036]  I'm a rock hound.
[02:28:34.257 --> 02:28:38.861]  My son and my older daughter are both rock pups, as they call them.
[02:28:39.602 --> 02:28:41.063]  You know, I mean, I want to go exploring.
[02:28:41.123 --> 02:28:42.264]  I want to do things.
[02:28:44.306 --> 02:28:50.892]  I mean, it's not some macho thing to go face down Storm Trooper police or mercenaries or sneak into Bohemian Grove.
[02:28:50.912 --> 02:28:52.453]  I mean, I'm really sick of it all, man.
[02:28:52.714 --> 02:28:54.195]  You know, I'm not complaining either.
[02:28:54.255 --> 02:28:54.836]  I'm just saying
[02:28:55.694 --> 02:28:59.335]  That there's a lot more to me than... I mean, I try to get up here and be calm on the air.
[02:28:59.375 --> 02:29:00.436]  I'm mad about this stuff.
[02:29:00.736 --> 02:29:02.576]  And I always paint a little painting on the back.
[02:29:03.096 --> 02:29:04.797]  Just some mindless doodle quickly.
[02:29:08.358 --> 02:29:09.098]  There's one there.
[02:29:10.519 --> 02:29:11.839]  There's a painting on the back of here.
[02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:15.320]  Signed the back all insanely.
[02:29:17.181 --> 02:29:19.422]  But I am going to try to do more of this.
[02:29:21.561 --> 02:29:22.942]  Just wanted to bring that up here.
[02:29:24.023 --> 02:29:25.324]  Two smaller paintings I did.
[02:29:26.384 --> 02:29:27.405]  Going back to Ted Anderson.
[02:29:27.445 --> 02:29:34.370]  Ted, again, you said that you're about to run out of the gold and silver you bought at the $9.90 level in the market.
[02:29:35.631 --> 02:29:36.912]  Explain to people those coins.
[02:29:38.072 --> 02:29:41.575]  You say you're going to hold it until midnight now, even if you lose money.
[02:29:41.895 --> 02:29:42.896]  That's your rodeo.
[02:29:44.275 --> 02:29:44.515]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:44.535 --> 02:29:44.855]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:45.676 --> 02:29:51.558]  Tell folks about the coins you've got at that price right now.
[02:29:51.818 --> 02:29:52.418]  Yeah, sure.
[02:29:52.498 --> 02:29:55.219]  I mean, the frank right now is at $233.
[02:29:55.299 --> 02:29:58.781]  For those of you who are listening, when gold was at $945, I was offering them at $236.
[02:29:58.841 --> 02:30:02.462]  So they're actually lower than they were back at that time.
[02:30:03.162 --> 02:30:05.023]  The British Sovereign currently at $288.
[02:30:05.063 --> 02:30:06.004]  They were $291.
[02:30:07.204 --> 02:30:10.465]  The Walking Liberty halves have been holding that price at $869 for a long time.
[02:30:12.659 --> 02:30:14.959]  Just because I was able to buy a real big position.
[02:30:15.940 --> 02:30:18.660]  All I can say is that people are finally waking up.
[02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:20.160]  We're getting a lot of phone calls.
[02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:21.601]  People are buying a lot of gold.
[02:30:21.821 --> 02:30:23.401]  And I don't want to stop that.
[02:30:24.081 --> 02:30:26.201]  I mean, people need to have gold right now.
[02:30:26.261 --> 02:30:35.463]  It's like one of the few things that they can put their hands on into their possession and actually expect the fact that it'll hold value for years to come.
[02:30:36.163 --> 02:30:38.644]  And the dollar isn't going to do that for you anymore.
[02:30:39.184 --> 02:30:40.284]  Unfortunately, it's sad.
[02:30:43.126 --> 02:30:47.231]  I don't get it.
[02:30:47.271 --> 02:30:50.915]  I told guys around the office I brought some paintings in and I got the sissy comment.
[02:30:51.436 --> 02:30:56.161]  There's nothing sissy about having images in your mind of beauty.
[02:30:56.181 --> 02:30:58.143]  It's like I admire a beautiful woman.
[02:30:58.503 --> 02:31:02.128]  I mean, I tried to catch that photo of a dark
[02:31:03.314 --> 02:31:06.917]  Dark house, in the middle of the day, my parents' living room table.
[02:31:07.598 --> 02:31:10.180]  It's kind of a dark room when the shades aren't up.
[02:31:11.101 --> 02:31:23.471]  And it was on a wooden table, and the camera had a flash on it, so it illuminated, and that's kind of my surreal, or impressionistic, it's more impressionistic, representation.
[02:31:25.012 --> 02:31:27.374]  It's impressionist more than anything.
[02:31:28.916 --> 02:31:30.717]  But it's a little bit of surreal at the same time.
[02:31:33.766 --> 02:31:35.167]  You know, 11, 12 years ago.
[02:31:36.608 --> 02:31:38.709]  And so, I think it's interesting.
[02:31:38.729 --> 02:31:41.111]  And of course, the studies show it's good for your brain, too.
[02:31:41.771 --> 02:31:44.393]  But, yeah, Ted, you've been in my house.
[02:31:44.613 --> 02:31:46.894]  Those oil paintings you see on the walls, I painted most of them.
[02:31:47.034 --> 02:31:47.995]  I didn't realize that.
[02:31:48.075 --> 02:31:49.176]  I didn't know they were your work.
[02:31:49.256 --> 02:31:50.357]  I mean, those are just awesome.
[02:31:50.537 --> 02:31:55.360]  I mean, every now and then you find something out about somebody and you just go, oh my God, I didn't realize that.
[02:31:55.860 --> 02:31:56.941]  And here I've been to your house.
[02:31:57.681 --> 02:31:58.862]  We had a really great time.
[02:31:59.375 --> 02:32:03.257]  At that Willie Nelson concert out in the, it was the concert in the, what do they call it?
[02:32:03.297 --> 02:32:07.999]  The park or whatever they, uh, and, uh, to meet your family and, you know, just to know more.
[02:32:08.139 --> 02:32:12.941]  I mean, it's, it's, you know, sometimes you have a picture in your mind and yeah, I think that's just great.
[02:32:13.601 --> 02:32:22.585]  Uh, anyways, getting back to the gold, Alex, all I can say is that I know unless of gold drops down in the $900 level again, and I don't think it's gonna.
[02:32:23.703 --> 02:32:25.987]  I'm not going to be able to come up with these prices anymore.
[02:32:26.007 --> 02:32:27.089]  The prices are going to go up.
[02:32:27.169 --> 02:32:28.271]  I can't hold.
[02:32:28.331 --> 02:32:30.615]  I'm not a miracle worker here.
[02:32:31.346 --> 02:32:41.069]  But I will take any deal up to midnight at these prices, and I would suggest that you get a move on it if you're thinking about it at all, because this is the time to be doing it.
[02:32:41.189 --> 02:32:47.410]  When you see the United Nations and these major countries, I mean, these are the countries that finance the United States.
[02:32:47.931 --> 02:32:53.552]  We quite literally had the prosperity we had here in the United States between the year 1980 and the year 2006 about.
[02:32:57.293 --> 02:33:05.500]  Because of the fact that they were able to lend us their prosperity, and we didn't have to suffer the consequences of inflating a currency.
[02:33:05.881 --> 02:33:16.010]  But now we're sitting here with even a much greater need for money to be lent to us, a much larger volume, a more ferocious appetite for debt.
[02:33:16.890 --> 02:33:24.157]  Because we're solving all of our problems, we're not going to go into a health care thing, the carbon taxes, I mean this whole thing is just
[02:33:24.878 --> 02:33:25.518]  We're good to go.
[02:33:41.647 --> 02:33:47.129]  And all it means is that they're turning on the printing press and they're solving all their financial troubles with that.
[02:33:47.610 --> 02:33:53.012]  And, you know, I'm not kidding you when I say Argentina, Brazil, Mexico.
[02:33:53.212 --> 02:33:55.693]  I mean, you think that all third world nations, they can't be the same.
[02:33:55.713 --> 02:33:56.253]  Well, guess what?
[02:33:56.293 --> 02:34:05.898]  The only difference between them and the United States is that the United States has some credibility for years that was carried on from a gold standard in 1971 and earlier.
[02:34:05.918 --> 02:34:08.199]  And now we're at the end of the rope.
[02:34:08.279 --> 02:34:08.739]  This is it.
[02:34:09.239 --> 02:34:10.120]  The game is over.
[02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:11.781]  People are realizing it.
[02:34:11.982 --> 02:34:13.543]  My phones are ringing, thank God.
[02:34:14.604 --> 02:34:15.725]  People are getting out of paper.
[02:34:15.785 --> 02:34:16.766]  They're going into gold.
[02:34:16.826 --> 02:34:19.688]  I just can't think of a better thing to do for people than that.
[02:34:20.509 --> 02:34:22.290]  And I just need to say it, Alex.
[02:34:22.330 --> 02:34:23.251]  People need to do it.
[02:34:23.932 --> 02:34:29.336]  It isn't a question of as to whether or not I think I should buy some gold and silver and how much and yadda yadda yadda.
[02:34:29.837 --> 02:34:32.559]  Hey, keep as much as you want in paper currency.
[02:34:32.599 --> 02:34:36.743]  Just expect the fact that you're going to buy an awful lot less with that in a very short period of time.
[02:34:37.628 --> 02:34:40.272]  I don't mean to predict the future, but that's just where we're going.
[02:34:41.013 --> 02:34:41.553]  Absolutely.
[02:34:41.573 --> 02:34:41.774]  800-686-2237.
[02:34:41.854 --> 02:34:47.622]  And again, your purchase also makes this radio show possible.
[02:34:47.882 --> 02:34:48.763]  Can't beat these deals.
[02:34:49.084 --> 02:34:51.147]  It goes until midnight tonight, Central Standard Time.
[02:34:51.187 --> 02:34:52.548]  Thank you so much, Dan Anderson.
[02:34:53.009 --> 02:34:54.091]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:34:54.858 --> 02:34:56.079]  You bet, good to have you here with us.
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:59.122]  Alright, I said I was going to take some calls.
[02:34:59.542 --> 02:35:01.604]  I'm really upset about what's happening with the dollar.
[02:35:01.644 --> 02:35:07.009]  I'm upset about the flu, that it's a live flu virus they're putting in the nasal spray and they admit it's spreading it.
[02:35:08.010 --> 02:35:09.211]  How dumb do they think we are?
[02:35:09.251 --> 02:35:13.134]  They'd spread it in front of everyone as the cure and then it'll be a big pandemic.
[02:35:13.194 --> 02:35:15.757]  I mean, these people are, they're bold.
[02:35:17.258 --> 02:35:18.199]  Con artists are bold.
[02:35:21.775 --> 02:35:26.139]  These aren't just con artists, these are eugenicists, control freaks that want to ruin our lives.
[02:35:26.519 --> 02:35:27.219]  They're predators.
[02:35:28.781 --> 02:35:32.043]  And at a very base level, I get threatened by people that attack me.
[02:35:32.484 --> 02:35:37.328]  People that attack me mentally, financially, liberty-wise, governmental.
[02:35:37.388 --> 02:35:38.649]  I mean, I can't help it.
[02:35:39.529 --> 02:35:43.573]  Somebody messes with me, I immediately start disliking them.
[02:35:44.275 --> 02:35:45.516]  I immediately start thinking about them.
[02:35:45.876 --> 02:35:48.398]  I immediately start thinking about ways to get my hands around their throat.
[02:35:49.358 --> 02:35:54.362]  And, you know, I try to not be like that, but I mean, you know, I'm sick of your crap, government!
[02:35:55.102 --> 02:35:58.544]  And all the corrupt scum that surrounds you.
[02:35:58.564 --> 02:36:00.025]  I've been trying to be calm all day.
[02:36:00.145 --> 02:36:00.946]  I am pissed!
[02:36:03.784 --> 02:36:05.345]  I just can't handle it anymore, man.
[02:36:05.405 --> 02:36:06.346]  I'm sick of it!
[02:36:06.786 --> 02:36:08.307]  I want government off my back!
[02:36:08.587 --> 02:36:14.550]  I want all the corrupt scum that's lazy and stupid, so you go join government to suck off of us, to get out of my life!
[02:36:14.610 --> 02:36:15.611]  I don't belong to you!
[02:36:15.631 --> 02:36:31.659]  And I'm sick of ill-informed morons trying to tell me how things work, or tell me what's going on, and how Obama's good, or Bush is good, or some jackass Democratic operative trying to mess with me right now.
[02:36:33.473 --> 02:36:35.961]  That I'm going to have to stomp Flattered to Pancake legally?
[02:36:35.981 --> 02:36:40.035]  I mean, I just get sick of all the crud that goes on around here behind the scenes.
[02:36:40.905 --> 02:36:51.111]  And all the stupid scum that don't understand that I'm on their team, that I want them to do well, that I know they're under eugenics, that they just buy into the fake paradigm and they run with it.
[02:36:51.611 --> 02:36:53.832]  And they have no connection to reality.
[02:36:54.212 --> 02:36:59.936]  All you stupid Obama supporters, all you stupid Bush supporters, they're all owned by the same people.
[02:37:00.236 --> 02:37:03.678]  And I know our audience knows that, but I'm talking to the new idiots tuning in.
[02:37:04.098 --> 02:37:05.599]  Listen, it's fundamental.
[02:37:05.919 --> 02:37:07.640]  What is so hard to explain to you?
[02:37:09.491 --> 02:37:11.652]  It's fundamental they're killing the dollar.
[02:37:12.472 --> 02:37:13.912]  Printing tens of trillions of it.
[02:37:14.573 --> 02:37:16.633]  It's fundamental it's going to plunge in value.
[02:37:16.973 --> 02:37:18.854]  It's fundamental gold's going to go up.
[02:37:19.554 --> 02:37:20.575]  It's fundamental!
[02:37:22.475 --> 02:37:24.076]  It isn't hard to figure out!
[02:37:27.157 --> 02:37:28.017]  Who's up next here?
[02:37:30.858 --> 02:37:32.379]  Anthony in New York, you're on the air.
[02:37:32.419 --> 02:37:33.159]  Go ahead, Anthony.
[02:37:33.839 --> 02:37:34.059]  Alex.
[02:37:34.979 --> 02:37:35.360]  Hey, buddy.
[02:37:35.940 --> 02:37:36.420]  How you doing?
[02:37:37.088 --> 02:37:38.128]  I'm not doing too good.
[02:37:38.468 --> 02:37:39.869]  God bless you for the job you do.
[02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:42.790]  Well, I mean, why?
[02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:44.090]  I've got to fight these people.
[02:37:44.130 --> 02:37:45.291]  I mean, I would be a moron.
[02:37:45.531 --> 02:37:48.952]  I would not have the instinct of self-preservation if I didn't fight these people.
[02:37:49.212 --> 02:37:49.832]  Well, of course.
[02:37:50.012 --> 02:37:51.073]  But God bless you anyway.
[02:37:51.133 --> 02:37:55.134]  And I'm a stockbroker from New York, and I couldn't agree with you and Ted more about gold.
[02:37:55.954 --> 02:37:59.896]  And if Peter Schiff inspired, I couldn't agree with him more about the foreign stocks.
[02:38:00.616 --> 02:38:06.438]  And if you look at the way the Swiss franc behaved during some of the bulk of the crisis with us last March,
[02:38:07.139 --> 02:38:09.461]  It shot up because they have commodity-based currency.
[02:38:10.422 --> 02:38:10.662]  Yeah.
[02:38:11.283 --> 02:38:14.345]  And I was at one of these town hall meetings last night with Steve Israel.
[02:38:14.585 --> 02:38:16.727]  And let me just tell you, this thing was totally rigged.
[02:38:17.428 --> 02:38:19.089]  And I was able to break through the rigging.
[02:38:19.129 --> 02:38:20.490]  I was standing right in front of them.
[02:38:21.191 --> 02:38:26.616]  And they had my question come through, but the League of Women Voters had to ask the questions for us.
[02:38:26.656 --> 02:38:27.536]  They wouldn't let us in.
[02:38:27.576 --> 02:38:28.797]  Total operatives, you know.
[02:38:29.358 --> 02:38:32.921]  But they call your name, and you stand up, and then they ask the question for you.
[02:38:32.961 --> 02:38:35.383]  So I stood up, and he has his cronies with him.
[02:38:35.902 --> 02:38:40.464]  He has his lawyer and a doctor and some other crony answering half the questions for him.
[02:38:41.184 --> 02:38:47.647]  So the lawyer goes to answer my question and I stood up and I shouted right in his face and I said, I want you to answer.
[02:38:48.728 --> 02:38:52.650]  And some people in the crowd told me to sit down and I said, no, I want him to answer.
[02:38:52.730 --> 02:38:55.531]  And the local paper, Newsday, took my picture.
[02:38:55.911 --> 02:38:56.652]  I'm in the paper.
[02:38:56.672 --> 02:39:00.193]  I'm on the Newsday.com website.
[02:39:01.734 --> 02:39:03.235]  And I want to run up against this guy.
[02:39:03.255 --> 02:39:03.975]  He's an independent.
[02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:08.782]  And of course, he's pushing the government takeover of healthcare?
[02:39:09.442 --> 02:39:10.223]  Yes, yes.
[02:39:11.223 --> 02:39:12.945]  And I want to run against him as an independent.
[02:39:12.965 --> 02:39:13.805]  I think I could do it.
[02:39:14.085 --> 02:39:26.093]  And I think we need guys like me and Peter Schiff in there that understand if we don't get our financial house in order, all the rest of the debate and all the rest of the issues, you know, there's nothing left if there's no currency.
[02:39:28.734 --> 02:39:34.598]  And we all know that saying, you know, control a nation's currency, and I care not who makes its laws.
[02:39:35.984 --> 02:39:37.145]  Good points, my friend.
[02:39:37.225 --> 02:39:39.647]  I appreciate you calling, Anthony from New York.
[02:39:39.667 --> 02:39:40.428]  Good to hear from you.
[02:39:40.888 --> 02:39:42.489]  Kurt in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:39:42.509 --> 02:39:44.191]  Hi, yes sir.
[02:39:45.011 --> 02:39:53.819]  I've heard you talk some time about the tracking cars to tax them for the miles that they drive.
[02:39:54.780 --> 02:39:55.060]  Yes.
[02:39:55.660 --> 02:40:01.305]  About two weeks ago, I tried to apply for insurance with the
[02:40:01.949 --> 02:40:09.331]  Certain company here, and after we talked about the policy on the car, the fellow said, we have a new program.
[02:40:10.971 --> 02:40:12.932]  Said, do you drive your car very much?
[02:40:12.972 --> 02:40:14.152]  And I said, no, I don't.
[02:40:14.652 --> 02:40:16.573]  Just back to the store and back.
[02:40:16.653 --> 02:40:17.353]  I'm retired.
[02:40:17.373 --> 02:40:21.434]  And he said, well, we have a new program.
[02:40:22.134 --> 02:40:31.237]  If we can put this little device in the car that will tell us where you're going and how many miles you traveled.
[02:40:31.775 --> 02:40:36.518]  During the day, we can offer you a 10% discount.
[02:40:36.979 --> 02:40:38.180]  Yeah, is it progressive?
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:39.741]  Yes, it is.
[02:40:40.361 --> 02:40:41.862]  Yeah, see they lied to you.
[02:40:42.543 --> 02:40:51.089]  They're getting money, thousands of dollars depending on the federal study, to put a satellite by the mile tracker in your car to test it.
[02:40:51.529 --> 02:40:53.511]  Texas is the main testing ground.
[02:40:53.911 --> 02:40:56.953]  Do you happen to be in Austin or surrounding areas?
[02:40:57.954 --> 02:40:58.214]  No.
[02:40:58.875 --> 02:41:00.436]  West Texas, Abilene.
[02:41:00.933 --> 02:41:03.715]  But you didn't mention Progressive to me, right?
[02:41:05.457 --> 02:41:05.837]  You did.
[02:41:06.377 --> 02:41:11.021]  Yeah, but I wanted to make sure, because I'm... Yeah, no, Progressive's the one doing that.
[02:41:11.522 --> 02:41:16.686]  Some others are doing it, and they admit, in the federal program, they're getting ready to tax this by the mile.
[02:41:16.706 --> 02:41:20.749]  You can Google, Austin test by the mile tax.
[02:41:21.790 --> 02:41:23.512]  And they're going to keep the oil tax, too.
[02:41:24.312 --> 02:41:28.616]  Oil tax revenues are at all-time highs, but they lie and say they're not, and they're going to...
[02:41:29.912 --> 02:41:37.297]  But Progressive already jacks in to what all new cars have had for at least a decade.
[02:41:37.317 --> 02:41:42.681]  They already have an onboard computer that tracks how fast you're driving, what happens, the cops use it to set you up.
[02:41:43.862 --> 02:41:49.526]  You know, if you roll your car now and aren't even drinking, they'll go ahead and take your kids and put you in prisons, you know, because they've got to fill these prisons.
[02:41:50.147 --> 02:41:52.629]  And so Progressive's a very, very wicked company.
[02:41:53.772 --> 02:41:56.915]  And very, very new world order, just like Microsoft and IBM.
[02:41:57.655 --> 02:41:59.497]  And so I would just get away from progressive.
[02:41:59.757 --> 02:42:08.184]  They're trying to make the whole industry shift where you've got to have government health care, $5,000, $3,000 to $5,000 a year fines.
[02:42:08.764 --> 02:42:11.126]  You're going to have to have expanded auto coverage.
[02:42:11.166 --> 02:42:12.907]  You're going to have to have other coverage.
[02:42:13.408 --> 02:42:18.172]  And then this is the nanny state where, oh, well, if you accept a chip or a tracker bracelet,
[02:42:18.792 --> 02:42:22.716]  I don't know if it was truly true or not, but a friend of mine said up at the Dallas Fair this year,
[02:42:40.794 --> 02:42:45.418]  They were putting a bracelet on the children when they came in.
[02:42:45.658 --> 02:42:47.419]  Yeah, they do that at Disney World.
[02:42:47.479 --> 02:42:48.700]  Face scan, hand scan.
[02:42:49.021 --> 02:42:52.283]  Same thing at SeaWorld.
[02:42:52.443 --> 02:42:53.945]  All slave grid training admitted.
[02:42:54.185 --> 02:42:55.986]  The Cashless Society control grid.
[02:42:56.307 --> 02:42:57.888]  Entire country, one giant prison.
[02:42:59.619 --> 02:43:01.279]  We all need to prepare ourselves.
[02:43:01.540 --> 02:43:06.281]  You might have the food, water, gold, and silver, but ask yourself, are you truly prepared?
[02:43:06.701 --> 02:43:09.162]  That's why you need to visit MaineMilitary.com.
[02:43:09.542 --> 02:43:11.902]  MaineMilitary.com carries everything you need.

[02:43:25.726 --> 02:43:27.709]  Are your local stores sold out of ammunition?
[02:43:28.109 --> 02:43:32.214]  Call or visit them today for prices on hard-to-find ammo and bulk ammo orders.

[02:43:49.072 --> 02:43:49.473]  That's 1-877-608-0179.
[02:43:49.573 --> 02:43:54.157]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:44:05.234 --> 02:44:10.578]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:44:11.118 --> 02:44:17.303]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:44:17.603 --> 02:44:19.424]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:44:19.584 --> 02:44:21.966]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:44:22.046 --> 02:44:32.934]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:44:35.234 --> 02:44:36.475]  It's not about left or right.
[02:44:36.895 --> 02:44:38.276]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:44:38.736 --> 02:44:45.101]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:44:45.661 --> 02:44:53.427]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:44:53.927 --> 02:44:55.068]  The Obama Deception.
[02:44:55.488 --> 02:44:56.749]  The people strike back.
[02:44:58.830 --> 02:44:59.971]  If you're tired of paying too
[02:45:03.473 --> 02:45:05.414]  Technology has the answer you're looking for.
[02:45:05.734 --> 02:45:07.475]  It's called FFT Fuel Saver.
[02:45:07.835 --> 02:45:18.639]  FFT Fuel Saver is made using a patented formula that helps fuel burn cleaner, resulting in a 10 to 20 percent increase in fuel efficiency and reduces emissions 30 percent or more.
[02:45:18.980 --> 02:45:27.543]  Each bottle of FFT Fuel Saver will save you money, increase your MPG, improve engine performance, and will treat up to 160 gallons of fuel.
[02:45:27.723 --> 02:45:31.665]  When used in your car, truck, motorcycle, or boat, you will feel the results in 20
[02:45:52.546 --> 02:45:52.786]  Stingray!
[02:45:52.826 --> 02:45:53.026]  Stingray!
[02:45:53.046 --> 02:45:53.266]  Stingray!
[02:45:53.547 --> 02:45:53.807]  Stingray!
[02:46:23.848 --> 02:46:25.069]  All right, I want to jam in.
[02:46:26.069 --> 02:46:28.451]  Scott, the UK, Shelly and Laura, if we have time.
[02:46:28.471 --> 02:46:32.013]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's show possible as well.
[02:46:33.374 --> 02:46:36.176]  They're great sponsors and they, again, fund everything we're doing here.
[02:46:36.216 --> 02:46:39.918]  AcolaBlue.com, the atmospheric water generator for your home or office.
[02:46:39.978 --> 02:46:42.680]  Grabs up to seven and a half gallons of water out of the air a day.
[02:46:43.020 --> 02:46:45.442]  Looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on the top.
[02:46:46.397 --> 02:46:46.698]  I don't
[02:47:06.354 --> 02:47:10.838]  Hidden sunglasses that have a great little digital chip that record video and audio.
[02:47:10.978 --> 02:47:11.519]  Pins.
[02:47:12.499 --> 02:47:13.560]  The lowest prices.
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:14.381]  Big seller.
[02:47:14.781 --> 02:47:15.282]  Diginet.net.
[02:47:15.342 --> 02:47:16.383]  Give them a call.
[02:47:16.403 --> 02:47:16.443]  888-344-6681.
[02:47:16.463 --> 02:47:16.503]  888-344-6681.
[02:47:16.523 --> 02:47:16.803]  Diginet.net.
[02:47:16.823 --> 02:47:17.484]  Great for court.
[02:47:17.604 --> 02:47:18.705]  Great to have with the police.
[02:47:18.725 --> 02:47:19.465]  Great to have at work.
[02:47:19.485 --> 02:47:19.646]  Anytime.
[02:47:29.974 --> 02:47:39.801]  You know, let's say you're a salesman or something going into dangerous neighborhoods, and a dog comes up and is about to bite you, you want to record it before you kick it in the head, or you know, if you work in dangerous areas, whatever.
[02:47:40.122 --> 02:47:44.565]  The point is it's good to have this, because people will say the dog did nothing to you, you know, that stuff works.
[02:47:44.885 --> 02:47:46.666]  Diginet.net, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:47.567 --> 02:47:48.968]  Let's jam in some calls quickly.
[02:47:49.368 --> 02:47:50.990]  Scott in the UK, then Shelly and Laura.
[02:47:51.050 --> 02:47:51.770]  Go ahead, Scott.
[02:47:52.891 --> 02:47:53.431]  Hello, Alex.
[02:47:54.272 --> 02:47:55.473]  Well done.
[02:47:55.493 --> 02:47:56.133]  You're doing good.
[02:47:59.053 --> 02:48:05.715]  Just calling up about the whole gold and dollar issue that just seemed to appear today.
[02:48:06.875 --> 02:48:18.818]  It's really made me wonder why is gold now such a thing to aim for and why has the American dollar just been made to plummet?
[02:48:19.138 --> 02:48:20.558]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[02:48:20.998 --> 02:48:23.779]  And one thing with the American dollar being the
[02:48:24.581 --> 02:48:30.604]  The world currency, does it actually matter what currency we're using as a world currency?
[02:48:31.064 --> 02:48:36.206]  Isn't the actual concept of using a currency corrupt in itself?
[02:48:37.206 --> 02:48:41.248]  Well, that's a huge question and huge issue and I don't claim to have all the answers.
[02:48:41.948 --> 02:48:47.210]  But gold is an intrinsic industrial metal used in thousands and thousands of different industries.
[02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:49.251]  Gold is the oldest form of money.
[02:48:49.671 --> 02:48:50.392]  It's finite.
[02:48:50.452 --> 02:48:52.032]  It's truly precious.
[02:48:52.973 --> 02:48:53.513]  It's scarce.
[02:48:54.707 --> 02:48:55.087]  I don't know.
[02:49:13.107 --> 02:49:17.008]  You can always get gold back, can't you, in its form as gold.
[02:49:17.588 --> 02:49:20.529]  I'm going to let you go because we're almost out of time.
[02:49:20.589 --> 02:49:21.369]  Thank you for the call.
[02:49:21.689 --> 02:49:23.910]  You can call me back tomorrow if you wish to discuss this more.
[02:49:25.330 --> 02:49:34.012]  The human population is six and a half billion and growing, and so the gold is in a lot of things, but people don't strip the gold out of a microchip generally when it goes to the landfill.
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:42.407]  So hell, I mean if people want stocks and bonds or people want paper money over gold, get into it.
[02:49:43.408 --> 02:49:51.295]  It's just oil and other commodities like gold and things and timber and real estate, things that have some intrinsic value.
[02:49:52.304 --> 02:49:58.208]  They are going to have more value during inflation and during currency devaluations.
[02:49:59.349 --> 02:50:04.493]  So gold is up because the bankers have issued tens of trillions of U.S.
[02:50:04.513 --> 02:50:05.413]  currency to the world.
[02:50:06.194 --> 02:50:07.875]  And it's just backed up by nothing.
[02:50:08.255 --> 02:50:11.097]  And so people rightfully are suspicious of it.
[02:50:11.117 --> 02:50:12.598]  I'm sorry to Shelly and Laura.
[02:50:12.618 --> 02:50:14.640]  Call me back tomorrow to go to the head of the line.
[02:50:17.884 --> 02:50:24.446]  Gold is up, not because gold is up, but because the dollar is being devalued by overprinting and over issuance.
[02:50:25.406 --> 02:50:31.108]  And what matters about a global currency is who controls the currency, because they can use it to destroy your nation.
[02:50:31.368 --> 02:50:35.329]  Read what Thomas Jefferson had to say, or Benjamin Franklin.
[02:50:35.470 --> 02:50:36.370]  Great job, crew.
[02:50:36.410 --> 02:50:37.650]  Retransmission starts now.
[02:50:38.130 --> 02:50:39.371]  InfoWars.com.
