[00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:05.413]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:11.599]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.941]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:22.167]  Big Brother.
[00:00:22.768 --> 00:00:23.849]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:25.690]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.132]  You want answers?
[00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.673]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:33.019]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:37.700]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:43.922]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:51.123]  We are now into our number two of the Syndicated Radio broadcast, 11 to 3 p.m.
[00:00:51.163 --> 00:00:52.864]  Central Standard Time daily.
[00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:56.625]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:03.951]  Don't forget the free podcast, now downloaded by over 120,000 people a day for free at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:07.394]  You can listen how you want, when you want, where you want, and save the shows.
[00:01:08.014 --> 00:01:15.421]  And we've also started simulcasting large portions of the radio show live, streaming at PrisonPlanet.tv for our members there.
[00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:22.608]  We also archive it for members, and then it's ripped to the four corners of the Google spheres, as Bush likes to call them, the internets.
[00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:51.743]  uh... and uh... reaching millions and millions a week that way just we can track so very very exciting we think all of you out there for your support for the next fifty nine minutes were joined by mike rovero and uh... mike of course uh... was famous for being one of the first expose events foster murder and one of the first real muck raking uh... websites uh... back in the mid nineteen nineties on the web what really happened dot com and he's also a fellow genesis uh... communications radio talk show
[00:01:53.403 --> 00:01:54.864]  here on the weekday evenings.
[00:01:55.244 --> 00:02:11.875]  And so he is with us for the rest of this hour to talk about Gaza, to talk about the New World Order that Kissinger is saying they're going to use the crises in Israel, the crisis with Russia, the crisis with India and Pakistan, which they're orchestrating to bring in their world government, and we'll talk about the economy and where he sees all this going.
[00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:20.061]  Mike, I have to say that Obama is certainly not disappointing those of us that knew that he was going to be a New World Order shill.
[00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:34.994]  Yeah, I'm afraid this has got to be one of the shortest political honeymoons in American history because we've already got, with Bill Richardson having to bow out, Rahm Emanuel's connections to the Blagojevich pay-for-play scandal.
[00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:41.158]  Yeah, I'm afraid that Obama is already going into office with some serious credibility issues.
[00:02:41.858 --> 00:02:49.423]  And again, I was a Ron Paul supporter and I only picked Obama because we really weren't given much of any other kind of a choice.
[00:02:50.623 --> 00:02:53.725]  Yeah, it's a pretty ugly situation out there.
[00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:57.067]  We're seeing his new economic stimulus plan come forward.
[00:02:57.147 --> 00:03:06.712]  It's a token amount of help to the ordinary working class American people, and as usual, more and more corporate handouts to the big boys, to the big corporations.
[00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:17.136]  Well there's also a bunch of money in there for United Nations eugenics operations and even the Huffington Post is writing about the fact that the UN is forcing abortions worldwide.
[00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:20.157]  But meanwhile Pat Robertson is defending China's forced abortions.
[00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:21.638]  The liberals are against it.
[00:03:21.658 --> 00:03:23.619]  I mean, is the world upside down, Mike?
[00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:25.855]  Yeah, it very much is.
[00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:31.178]  It seems like people who used to be in favor of policy A have flipped over.
[00:03:31.218 --> 00:03:33.920]  They're now in charge of policy Z, and it goes back and forth.
[00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:41.826]  The neocons are more liberal than the liberals, and the liberals are actually becoming quite conservative in the paleoconservative point of view.
[00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:49.771]  Everybody's scrambling to find whatever position they can use to sell, and it really is not politics of principle anymore.
[00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:54.114]  It is really the politics of whatever's going to work and get the money and votes flowing their way.
[00:03:55.515 --> 00:03:58.217]  Mike, we're going to break here in a moment and come back in a long segment.
[00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:02.179]  Obviously, I know you want to get into what's happening over in Israel right now.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:14.548]  It's in the Israeli papers that they broke the ceasefire with Hamas, blocking off the entrance into Israel, the checkpoints, and killing Hamas leaders and targeted airstrikes.
[00:04:14.848 --> 00:04:22.213]  We have this hoax, though, in our media saying that the Gazans, that the Palestinians broke the truce.
[00:04:22.253 --> 00:04:25.055]  So I want to get your take on that larger operation.
[00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:28.217]  But what are some of the other areas you want to get into today?
[00:04:29.077 --> 00:04:30.378]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:04:30.418 --> 00:04:39.843]  We need to be looking at the economy because the economy could be one of the motivating causes to bring on this so-called New World Order that Kissinger's talking about.
[00:04:40.503 --> 00:04:51.610]  We already know that the various laws already passed to bring about a transition of our country into a dictatorship include an economic crash as a possible reason.
[00:04:52.668 --> 00:05:00.075]  All right, Mike Rivera, by the way, is our first guest via web feed, so you can visually see him as well.
[00:05:00.836 --> 00:05:05.460]  From Hawaii, I'm in Austin, Texas, and we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.562]  We'll be back after these important messages.
[00:05:07.602 --> 00:05:08.203]  They are important.
[00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:09.504]  They make this transmission possible.
[00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:12.787]  We'll go right back to Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:05:13.127 --> 00:05:13.568]  Stay with us.
[00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:29.581]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.
[00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:32.725]  Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[00:05:33.326 --> 00:05:40.051]  Between now and January 20, 2009, all food units U1 through U7 are being offered at wholesale prices.
[00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:42.093]  That's a 33% savings.
[00:05:42.393 --> 00:05:45.675]  A year's supply of meals starts as low as 73 cents per meal.
[00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:52.861]  Ready Reserve Food offers only the highest quality dehydrated food, packed in double enameled cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere.
[00:05:57.978 --> 00:06:01.559]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.580]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:27.182]  Who is the enemy?
[00:06:27.702 --> 00:06:28.223]  Bin Laden.
[00:06:28.503 --> 00:06:29.424]  This is his M.O.
[00:06:29.464 --> 00:06:30.805]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:32.527]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:39.613]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:06:40.013 --> 00:06:40.454]  Some U.S.
[00:06:40.494 --> 00:06:46.139]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:50.362]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:06:50.662 --> 00:06:53.143]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:20.151]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:24.414]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:07:24.574 --> 00:07:36.022]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:07:36.242 --> 00:07:46.729]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:47.589]  I think so.
[00:08:21.573 --> 00:08:25.756]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:26.396 --> 00:08:27.217]  You want answers?
[00:08:27.978 --> 00:08:28.898]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:28.918 --> 00:08:33.201]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:37.784]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:56.158]  It is the sixth day of January 2009.
[00:08:57.179 --> 00:08:59.860]  Mike Rivera with us for another 52 minutes.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.281]  Mike Rivera, investigative journalist, and again, the man that runs the great website WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:13.904]  He's also a fellow who works in the media, but we won't brag on some of the great work he does on shows like Lost.
[00:09:15.386 --> 00:09:16.226]  Let's continue.
[00:09:16.586 --> 00:09:23.389]  Mike, let's get first into your take on what's really happening with Israel.
[00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:29.710]  Obviously, you've got Olmert who had a 32-33% approval rating, depending on the poll.
[00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.131]  Now it's upwards of 60% going into elections in six months.
[00:09:33.992 --> 00:09:35.252]  We've got that stunt going.
[00:09:35.692 --> 00:09:37.733]  We have this old Ariel Sharon plan.
[00:09:38.073 --> 00:09:41.374]  He calls it the 48 option of when they started driving the Arabs.
[00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:47.296]  Out of Palestine in 1948, the year after Israel had driven the British out in 1947.
[00:09:47.376 --> 00:09:53.438]  So, I mean, Israel's on record saying what they're doing, siege, to make life so untenable they can force them out.
[00:09:53.798 --> 00:09:55.558]  Do you think they're going to bring in U.S.
[00:09:55.618 --> 00:09:55.938]  troops?
[00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:03.461]  Will that be the unpopular move done January 21st, his first official day after swearing in on the 20th?
[00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:07.422]  Or is it all these things Obama's doing that are, quote, going to be unpopular?
[00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:13.304]  Well, there's a lot of things that are unpopular right now, as we can see in the corporate media.
[00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:18.328]  The operation in Gaza has literally, it's being dropped in importance.
[00:10:18.388 --> 00:10:19.568]  It's down to the bottom crawl.
[00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:20.489]  U.S.
[00:10:20.549 --> 00:10:22.690]  troops are already directly involved.
[00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:28.014]  They're standing guard at the Rafah crossing to make sure that Palestinians don't escape the slaughter.
[00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:28.915]  So U.S.
[00:10:28.955 --> 00:10:32.177]  forces are already engaged, at least in that capacity.
[00:10:32.617 --> 00:10:38.221]  Plus, of course, we've got all the advisors who are over there with Israel, teaching them how to use all this equipment that we're giving them.
[00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:41.744]  So we're already kind of neck deep in this situation.
[00:10:41.804 --> 00:10:43.425]  It's not being reported all that much.
[00:10:44.466 --> 00:10:47.768]  Yes, the upcoming Israeli elections are a big part of what's going on.
[00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:52.612]  This is a bloody campaign banner that they're waving all over the place.
[00:10:53.133 --> 00:10:57.737]  And the other issue is, you're absolutely correct, this is about getting the Palestinians out of Gaza.
[00:10:57.777 --> 00:11:00.559]  The Israelis have coveted Gaza all along.
[00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:04.282]  It's this nice beachfront property, would be worth a lot of money if it was redeveloped.
[00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:11.544]  There's all the natural gas reserves off the coast of Gaza, which Israel basically also covets.
[00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:14.425]  And you know, the funny thing is, you talk about Ariel Sharon.
[00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:31.790]  Back in 2005, before his stroke, Ariel Sharon made this kind of deal with the United States and the rest of the world, and that was that if we would turn a blind eye to the building of illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which is banned by the Geneva Conventions,
[00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.312]  and uh... u.s.
[00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:49.413]  that u n charter rather regarding the uh... the use of occupied territories if we would turn a blind eye and let him build all these illegal settlements in the west bank that they would pull out of gaza and let the palestinians just have their little piece of land down there and i predicted back then
[00:11:49.953 --> 00:12:04.860]  That as soon as the settlements were completed and built in the West Bank and there was no way of going back from that, that Israel would create a justification to go back in, reoccupy Gaza, and basically start work at building new settlements in there.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:22.847]  Well, Mike, by the way, you're right, but even the Israeli papers admit these battle plans written up by the former general, who's now the head of Mossad, were written up in 2000 to do exactly what you're saying in Lebanon to the north and then down the south on the Egyptian border with the Gaza Strip there on the Mediterranean.
[00:12:23.587 --> 00:12:30.509]  So this is so cynical to have our controlled corporate press telling us that, you know, the Gazans attacked for no reason.
[00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:31.950]  They had the border crossings blocked.
[00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.711]  They were getting bombed every week, having their leaders killed.
[00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:37.552]  The ceasefire was broken by Israel.
[00:12:37.572 --> 00:12:39.072]  That's all over the foreign press.
[00:12:39.452 --> 00:12:42.733]  The French, the British, the German, the Russian press.
[00:12:43.094 --> 00:12:50.556]  But here in the United States, now with the internet, I can watch foreign mainline feeds and it's all the truth submitted in the foreign press.
[00:12:51.016 --> 00:12:53.317]  Here, it's just...
[00:12:54.494 --> 00:13:01.398]  A complete fraud, and even if you're for Israel in all of this, are you for the media lying to us as a people?
[00:13:01.418 --> 00:13:06.761]  I mean, that's what I'm saying to folks out there that are upset that we're reporting the facts.
[00:13:06.841 --> 00:13:11.984]  All we're reporting is what Israel says they're really doing, not the rhetoric and propaganda we're being fed.
[00:13:12.967 --> 00:13:14.028]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:14.368 --> 00:13:20.435]  The PR war to support Israel is more intense here in the United States than it is even within Israel itself.
[00:13:20.855 --> 00:13:33.548]  I think one of the things that really pegged what we call the bovine excrement meter over here, what really happened, was last week when Bush is calling Hamas governorship of Palestine
[00:13:34.528 --> 00:13:37.911]  And Gaza the result of a coup and that is absolutely a lie.
[00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:39.812]  Hamas won the election.
[00:13:40.172 --> 00:13:46.096]  It was Fatah that staged a partially successful coup to regain control of the West Bank.
[00:13:46.636 --> 00:14:03.147]  And given that the Bush administration's own legitimacy is very much in question because of the 2004 and 2000 election frauds, it is the height of double dealing hypocrisy and deception for Bush to be saying that Hamas is in control of Gaza only because of some kind of a coup.
[00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:05.148]  And it's absolutely not true.
[00:14:06.709 --> 00:14:08.430]  Mike, continue on that point.
[00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:13.273]  Well, basically, they had an election.
[00:14:13.933 --> 00:14:17.176]  Everyone said, OK, Israel has pulled out of Gaza.
[00:14:17.216 --> 00:14:19.337]  It is time for the Palestinians to have an election.
[00:14:19.737 --> 00:14:21.118]  And they did a big show about it.
[00:14:21.458 --> 00:14:25.641]  And the Gazans voted for Hamas to be their government.
[00:14:26.401 --> 00:14:32.604]  And, of course, this upset Israel, which wanted Fatah to win, and it upset the United States, which wanted Fatah to win.
[00:14:32.904 --> 00:14:40.107]  And so, ever since then, they have been trying to basically oust the legitimately elected government of Gaza, and that's what's going on.
[00:14:40.147 --> 00:14:47.330]  Now, everyone's talking about the ceasefire that was in place, and the interesting thing is that six months ago, when the ceasefire was agreed to,
[00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.413]  Israel was already planning this current campaign inside Gaza.
[00:14:51.753 --> 00:14:59.819]  They built a model of Gaza City at an Israeli military base out in the Negev desert to train and practice for.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.143]  So we know all along that Israel was expecting this ceasefire to be destroyed.
[00:15:04.463 --> 00:15:08.726]  That it was just a fraud to give everybody some breathing room while they went out and they did their training.
[00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:20.013]  Propaganda statement that, oh, we tried to be peaceful, we pulled some of our settlers out, and Israeli papers are cynically admitting that this was their masterstroke.
[00:15:20.353 --> 00:15:21.013]  Propaganda.
[00:15:21.033 --> 00:15:27.037]  That's what's so insulting, is that they're admitting what you're saying, that they intended to break the truce all along.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.822]  Well, the important thing to remember is the ceasefire.
[00:15:30.962 --> 00:15:45.654]  It was not only just a ceasefire, but what Hamas said to Israel is, we will stop shooting rockets at you if you will allow supplies and material and the things that we need to run our lives to come in through the border crossings.
[00:15:46.014 --> 00:15:49.798]  And Israel reneged on that deal all over the last six months.
[00:15:50.118 --> 00:15:54.922]  They keep making it more and more difficult for people and supplies and medicine and food.
[00:15:55.342 --> 00:15:58.744]  and construction materials and school supplies to get over the border.
[00:15:59.044 --> 00:16:07.349]  Then November 4th, right on the same day as the US elections, when the American people aren't paying attention, they slam the blockade absolutely shut.
[00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.651]  They absolutely close off all the borders.
[00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:11.752]  They make it impossible for anything to get in and get out.
[00:16:12.092 --> 00:16:14.213]  They start creating this huge humanitarian disaster.
[00:16:14.513 --> 00:16:15.434]  No fuel can get in.
[00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:19.356]  So Hamas has to draw attention to the crisis.
[00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:23.519]  So they start shooting their tinker toy glorified Estes bottle rockets
[00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:37.169]  At them, it's killed 17 people in the last few years, and that's not a good thing, but nothing compared to the thousands of dead and tens of thousands of injured in all of these different history of bombing raids and attacks that have gone on there.
[00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:39.090]  So what bargaining chip do they have?
[00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.733]  The deal's broken, and Israel acts like
[00:16:43.493 --> 00:16:45.954]  You know, they gave the Gazans this land.
[00:16:46.154 --> 00:16:56.596]  This is where the Palestinians that were in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv and other cities in the 40s and 50s were driven out in those pogroms against them.
[00:16:56.636 --> 00:16:58.956]  I mean, markets were blown up.
[00:16:58.996 --> 00:16:59.776]  People were killed.
[00:17:00.076 --> 00:17:06.518]  Neighborhoods were bombed to drive them out to the edges of Israel, and now we have a mopping up going on.
[00:17:07.038 --> 00:17:12.479]  And then the media dare claim that these are invading Muslims, invading Arabs into Israel.
[00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:13.979]  Such a hoax!
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.200]  It is.
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.700]  It's black is white.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:21.362]  And you know, on November 5th, one day after the blockade, Israel attacked Gaza.
[00:17:21.382 --> 00:17:23.803]  They killed six Palestinians, six Hamas officials.
[00:17:24.203 --> 00:17:26.804]  So Israel really did break this ceasefire.
[00:17:27.124 --> 00:17:33.247]  As far as the rockets going back into Israel, they're not only ineffective, there's some reason to think that at least some of them
[00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:33.827]  I think?
[00:17:52.356 --> 00:18:03.742]  And it appears that this was an effort, again by Israel, to shoot a few rockets back into Israel, say, oh my goodness, Lebanon is attacking, and restart that war as well.
[00:18:03.942 --> 00:18:09.004]  Even today, Israeli warplanes are overflying Lebanon without permission.
[00:18:09.044 --> 00:18:09.844]  That's an act of war.
[00:18:10.085 --> 00:18:15.147]  They're trying to provoke Hezbollah into firing at their jets or doing anything.
[00:18:15.487 --> 00:18:25.270]  That Israel can point to as an excuse to start a new ground war in Lebanon up to the Latani River, which they have been coveting for quite some time as a water resource.
[00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.411]  So it's this incredible fakery and hoax going on.
[00:18:28.451 --> 00:18:32.192]  We know the motto of the Mossad, by way of deception, thou shalt conquer.
[00:18:32.772 --> 00:18:38.118]  We know that Israel has faked attacks against others under false flag again.
[00:18:38.438 --> 00:18:45.545]  And it's entirely possible that a lot of these bottle rockets that are being fired, because they're homemade, nobody really knows where they're coming from.
[00:18:45.905 --> 00:18:47.026]  It is entirely possible.
[00:18:47.347 --> 00:18:48.087]  Let's stop there.
[00:18:48.488 --> 00:18:51.511]  They're also trying to claim Iran is manufacturing these.
[00:18:51.551 --> 00:18:54.213]  Now clearly Iran was backing Hezbollah.
[00:18:55.374 --> 00:19:20.399]  uh... in the north but uh... there's not a big connection with iran and this rival group hamas but but on top of that we forget uh... lending credibility what you're saying in many palestinians are saying we know that the puppet government that israel had in gaza was kicked out of the elections and they wanted israel to go in and we know they have massive operatives tens of thousands that were formerly in the government and military
[00:19:21.459 --> 00:19:26.063]  in Gaza, and they are the exact type of people that could be firing those rockets back into Israel.
[00:19:26.083 --> 00:19:28.245]  So you have the motive, you have it all right there.
[00:19:28.885 --> 00:19:30.907]  So certainly, there's a lot of evidence to that point.
[00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:39.313]  And plus, Israel founded Hamas to begin with, so it could be coming from Israeli operatives within Hamas as well, not just from the Fatah.
[00:19:40.614 --> 00:19:48.320]  Yeah, it's kind of an interesting history because when Arafat and the PLO started to unite Palestine politically,
[00:19:50.213 --> 00:19:51.033]  Do we have to break here?
[00:19:51.253 --> 00:19:52.034]  Yes, we're going to break.
[00:19:52.654 --> 00:19:52.894]  Okay.
[00:19:53.154 --> 00:20:05.758]  When we come back, let's get into that, that in the mid-70s, when the PLO was really getting a lot of credibility over there, they founded Hamas as a counterweight to it, and our source of that is the Jerusalem Post, UPI, and others.
[00:20:06.118 --> 00:20:06.859]  That is admitted.
[00:20:06.899 --> 00:20:07.819]  Israel doesn't deny that.
[00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:10.800]  Alright, we'll come right back with Mike Rivera after this quick break.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:16.182]  We'll continue with what's happening in Israel, move into India and Pakistan, then look at the economy, and take some of your phone calls.
[00:20:23.382 --> 00:20:24.644]  The time clock is ticking.
[00:20:25.305 --> 00:20:26.247]  Laws could change.
[00:20:26.607 --> 00:20:28.811]  The New World Order is advancing rapidly.
[00:20:29.355 --> 00:20:31.436]  Health consciousness is fading away.
[00:20:31.836 --> 00:20:36.999]  Junk food, fast food, fat food is the New World Orders game.
[00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:38.860]  Don't play the game!
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:45.624]  Slim down, detox, and cleanse yourself from the chemical foods and processed food that we intake daily.
[00:20:45.824 --> 00:20:47.264]  And now for the holiday special.
[00:20:47.404 --> 00:20:50.646]  Buy one month of Super T and we'll throw in an extra two weeks.
[00:20:50.886 --> 00:20:51.427]  That's right.

[00:20:54.948 --> 00:20:55.809]  It won't last long.

[00:21:30.129 --> 00:21:40.776]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:44.398]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:21:44.578 --> 00:21:46.299]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:21:46.339 --> 00:21:52.083]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:22:08.092 --> 00:22:10.355]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[00:22:10.736 --> 00:22:16.063]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:22:16.986 --> 00:22:20.887]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:22:21.107 --> 00:22:33.369]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:34.189]  The U.S.
[00:22:34.229 --> 00:22:39.830]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.431]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:45.351]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:22:45.391 --> 00:22:48.232]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:22:48.352 --> 00:22:54.375]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:22:54.795 --> 00:22:58.156]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:22:58.236 --> 00:23:04.558]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:23:05.137 --> 00:23:09.144]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:23:09.264 --> 00:23:09.465]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:09.485 --> 00:23:09.685]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:16.841 --> 00:23:20.003]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:23:20.363 --> 00:23:22.105]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:23:22.265 --> 00:23:27.608]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:23:27.828 --> 00:23:35.554]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:23:35.854 --> 00:23:46.541]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[00:23:46.561 --> 00:23:46.941]  I think so.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.421]  Mike Rivero is our guest.
[00:24:33.761 --> 00:24:38.584]  Mike, let's continue as we speak to him from Hawaii.
[00:24:38.624 --> 00:24:45.688]  Got him up on the video feed right now at PrisonPlanet.tv as we simulcast the 4-hour radio show here today.
[00:24:46.308 --> 00:24:49.530]  Continuing with the point we're trying to make as we went into the break.
[00:24:50.933 --> 00:25:13.682]  Well, basically the point is that when Yasser Arafat started to get the PLO to unify the Palestinians into a political movement to argue for their independence or their liberation, Shin Bet, the Israeli security force, created and secretly funded Hamas as a counterpoint to prevent the formation of a united Palestine.
[00:25:14.002 --> 00:25:17.424]  They just wanted to keep playing the two groups back and forth off of each other.
[00:25:17.764 --> 00:25:28.850]  Then when Arafat was assassinated, Israel basically stopped funding Hamas because they figured they didn't need him anymore and Hamas basically didn't want to give up the political power they had collected.
[00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:34.273]  So they started working on their own and becoming, again, what Israel most feared.
[00:25:34.614 --> 00:25:40.377]  A political entity able to unite the Palestinians in their quest for independence from Israel.
[00:25:40.717 --> 00:25:43.319]  Well, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:25:43.339 --> 00:25:46.322]  I mean, with this type of oppression, these people don't have a choice.
[00:25:46.362 --> 00:25:48.304]  They're always going to have to fight back.
[00:25:48.644 --> 00:25:51.907]  And frankly, all this adversity is only going to make them more cohesive.
[00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:53.870]  Absolutely.
[00:25:53.930 --> 00:26:02.592]  So Israel comes up with Fatah to basically play against Hamas the way they had originally funded Hamas to play against the PLO.
[00:26:03.152 --> 00:26:09.494]  And Hamas realizes they've been double-crossed on this matter, and Israel's going to keep on playing the game.
[00:26:09.594 --> 00:26:18.356]  Anytime anybody's able to start pulling together the Palestinians, Israel will create a new fake front group with a lot more money and a lot more support.
[00:26:18.476 --> 00:26:19.596]  To stage terror attacks.
[00:26:20.456 --> 00:26:22.877]  Well, to keep the Palestinians divided against each other.
[00:26:22.897 --> 00:26:27.860]  And as long as they're squabbling against each other, they won't unite against their oppressors.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.281]  It's called divide and conquer.
[00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:30.562]  We see it here in the United States.
[00:26:30.842 --> 00:26:33.623]  The rich against the poor, the men against the women, the young against the old.
[00:26:33.703 --> 00:26:35.724]  Constantly the blacks against the white.
[00:26:35.785 --> 00:26:41.047]  Constantly finding these divisions and keeping the American people squabbling among themselves.
[00:26:41.067 --> 00:26:41.508]  Balkanization!
[00:26:42.348 --> 00:26:47.031]  Yeah, rather than uniting against those entities which are actually the root of all their problems.
[00:26:48.129 --> 00:26:49.110]  All right, other points.
[00:26:49.911 --> 00:26:51.152]  Where do you see this going?
[00:26:51.513 --> 00:26:52.834]  How do you see this unfolding?
[00:26:52.874 --> 00:26:56.498]  The siege of Gaza City and the other two cities in the Strip.
[00:26:57.299 --> 00:26:58.120]  Where do you see that going?
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.903]  Do you see an escalation in US or NATO or UN forces?
[00:27:01.243 --> 00:27:06.208]  We know those were openly discussed about going into southern Lebanon, but that didn't happen because of the unpopularity of
[00:27:07.237 --> 00:27:08.798]  Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:27:09.138 --> 00:27:21.284]  Do you see them now getting new legs or a new lease on life, like Kissinger saying, you know, the world loves Obama so much we're going to be able to get a lot of our New World Order agenda done, as he said at the Stock Exchange yesterday on CNBC.
[00:27:21.304 --> 00:27:22.424]  Where do you see this going?
[00:27:22.444 --> 00:27:23.685]  How do you see it unfolding?
[00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:30.200]  Well, obviously the people who want a greater regional war are continuing to push for that.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.542]  We saw it all over the talking heads earlier today.
[00:27:32.862 --> 00:27:36.705]  They're talking about how Iran is inevitably linked to what's going on in Gaza.
[00:27:36.965 --> 00:27:38.706]  They're trying to sell this as hard as they can.
[00:27:39.046 --> 00:27:43.209]  I think Israel's going to try and make any excuse they can to at least go back into Lebanon.
[00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:48.093]  This is going to not begin and end just with little tiny Gaza.
[00:27:48.593 --> 00:27:52.115]  This is definitely an opening to try and get a huge regional war going.
[00:27:52.395 --> 00:27:56.256]  There's a huge rush because of the upcoming Israeli elections.
[00:27:56.596 --> 00:28:13.083]  And of course, even though Kissinger's making that statement about New World Order and Barack Obama, the consensus opinion within Israel itself is that Obama, as supportive as he has been for Israel, is not going to be writing the blank checks that Bush did for these wars of conquest and genocide.
[00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:18.085]  And so they want to get this thing really cranked up before Obama can come into office.
[00:28:18.305 --> 00:28:22.226]  They want to create the problem to commit the United States regardless.
[00:28:22.246 --> 00:28:22.786]  I agree with you.
[00:28:22.806 --> 00:28:30.188]  Now, by the way, their Secretary of Defense, their former Prime Minister, has been on record saying this.
[00:28:30.348 --> 00:28:31.428]  He said it three days ago.
[00:28:31.448 --> 00:28:32.849]  He said it on Saturday.
[00:28:32.889 --> 00:28:38.770]  He said, we may widen this into other areas like southern Lebanon.
[00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:42.951]  So they're on record confirming what you're saying, that they want a wider conflict.
[00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:45.116]  Yeah, absolutely they do.
[00:28:45.156 --> 00:28:47.117]  They want to go up at least to the Latani River.
[00:28:47.657 --> 00:28:50.058]  There's always been talk about Eretz Israel.
[00:28:50.318 --> 00:28:51.639]  They'd love to go into Syria.
[00:28:51.879 --> 00:28:57.782]  And ultimately, of course, as we've seen over the last several years, Israel is pushing for war on Iran, just as Israel was the prime motivator.
[00:28:57.842 --> 00:28:58.542]  Oh yeah, they're claiming Iran.
[00:28:58.582 --> 00:29:04.545]  In fact, they have editorials in the LA Times with Israeli operatives openly saying, we want to have war with Iran.
[00:29:05.005 --> 00:29:07.446]  And also Israel's admitting they got their nose bloodied.
[00:29:07.707 --> 00:29:10.408]  Their aura of invincibility got shattered by Hezbollah.
[00:29:11.328 --> 00:29:16.954]  And those people sworn to fight to the death against one of the most modern militaries in the world two years ago.
[00:29:17.014 --> 00:29:34.611]  And so Israel is again wanting to, they've been building up, coordinating, planning to try to get this image of infallibility and invincibility back because they need that Borg image of resistance is futile.
[00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:36.670]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.394]  Israel's reputation, Israel's image is definitely on the wane here.
[00:29:41.854 --> 00:29:48.940]  And I think, regardless of what happens in Gaza, the reality is Israel has lost this war in the court of public opinion.
[00:29:49.861 --> 00:29:50.902]  And it's only getting worse.
[00:29:52.604 --> 00:29:53.124]  Absolutely.
[00:29:53.384 --> 00:29:54.185]  Mike Rivero, stay there.

[00:31:16.976 --> 00:31:23.320]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:31:23.661 --> 00:31:25.342]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:31:26.317 --> 00:31:27.338]  But who is the enemy?
[00:31:27.859 --> 00:31:28.359]  Bin Laden.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.641]  This is his M.O.
[00:31:29.661 --> 00:31:30.943]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:31:31.023 --> 00:31:32.665]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:31:33.025 --> 00:31:39.773]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:31:40.173 --> 00:31:40.614]  Some U.S.
[00:31:40.654 --> 00:31:46.321]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:31:46.981 --> 00:31:50.482]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:31:50.502 --> 00:31:52.643]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:32:16.903 --> 00:32:18.404]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:32:18.584 --> 00:32:20.026]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:32:20.326 --> 00:32:22.568]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:32:23.008 --> 00:32:27.752]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:32:28.152 --> 00:32:30.995]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:33:54.934 --> 00:33:57.355]  I want to go to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:57.375 --> 00:34:01.137]  Before we get into the economy, though, Mike, I know it doesn't sound like you.
[00:34:01.177 --> 00:34:02.157]  You've probably seen it.
[00:34:02.197 --> 00:34:04.158]  It's probably up on your website, whatreallyhappened.com.
[00:34:04.238 --> 00:34:07.419]  I know it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:07.819 --> 00:34:10.100]  Kissinger calls for a new world order on
[00:34:12.361 --> 00:34:15.623]  CNBC yesterday, and we played the clip back in the last hour.
[00:34:15.643 --> 00:34:20.707]  We're just going to roll some of the videos so people can see this demonic creature there on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:34:21.367 --> 00:34:29.112]  And he again says we can use this crisis, you mentioned earlier, so I guess you have seen it, for our New World Order.
[00:34:30.613 --> 00:34:34.156]  Again, why are they constantly admitting they're setting up a New World Order, a world government?
[00:34:34.556 --> 00:34:41.961]  Why have they had the Financial Times of London and all these papers come out and say, yes, there's a world government, yes, it's for your own good, it's going to save you,
[00:34:43.922 --> 00:34:48.424]  Meanwhile, the FBI training manuals and police training still tell the police it doesn't exist.
[00:34:48.724 --> 00:34:50.125]  Insane people say it exists.
[00:34:51.086 --> 00:34:56.589]  I've got police manuals where it says, go ahead and take somebody into jail if you find this stuff in their car, because they're probably a terrorist.
[00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.830]  Police chiefs, support your officers if they arrest somebody for no reason.
[00:35:00.591 --> 00:35:02.672]  That's in mainline police magazines, not even the
[00:35:05.814 --> 00:35:17.962]  Well, basically it's a public relation campaign.
[00:35:18.002 --> 00:35:29.550]  They're trying to put the most positive face on this idea of global government, but at the same time they're trying to silence those who are critical of the whole concept, and that's the reason for this double standard in behavior.
[00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.812]  The reason for all the positive articles, as you point out,
[00:35:33.252 --> 00:35:36.733]  Is to convince everybody that this would really be a very, very good thing.
[00:35:36.993 --> 00:35:43.294]  That's a hard sell right now, because globalism is seen by most people as what got us into this economic mess.
[00:35:43.995 --> 00:35:51.316]  Because, you know, under the old nation-state model, the United States economic problems would have been confined mostly to the United States.
[00:35:51.776 --> 00:35:55.297]  It was this whole international global trade that allowed the U.S.
[00:35:55.357 --> 00:35:58.338]  economic meltdown to start dragging down the rest of the world with it.
[00:35:58.778 --> 00:36:09.953]  So selling globalism as a cure for globalism is going to be a really hard sell and this is why they're going out and they're trying to silence anybody who's pointing out this very obvious discrepancy.
[00:36:10.563 --> 00:36:39.340]  Well, exactly, and then meanwhile Greece has been deep into the IMF World Bank plan, where they come in, they take over the economy, they hand over the roads, the power plants, the infrastructure, for pennies on the dollar to foreign corporations, they lay off the people, their economy implodes, so the public starts peacefully demonstrating, the police shoot some folks, then the people start attacking the banks, the central banks, the government buildings, so the police have now been caught, it's on mainstream Greece television, the police admit it,
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.220]  I think?
[00:36:59.397 --> 00:36:59.617]  All of this
[00:37:20.152 --> 00:37:33.010]  All of this going on and happening, and so they're having to stage these events as globalism begins to collapse, and now they want to bring in their iron fist of police state, not just in Greece, but in Europe, in the United States, in England.
[00:37:34.032 --> 00:37:34.813]  It isn't going to work.
[00:37:34.873 --> 00:37:36.575]  I mean, people know they're the bad guys.
[00:37:37.489 --> 00:37:38.550]  Yeah, it really is.
[00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.272]  It's a very different world because of the alternative media, because of the Internet especially.
[00:37:42.752 --> 00:37:46.394]  The tricks that worked 30, 40, 50 years ago don't work any longer.
[00:37:46.494 --> 00:37:59.942]  And unfortunately, the people in charge of these projects, they're a bunch of Cold War fossils who just don't get it that the fundamental nature of information flow in our society has changed.
[00:38:00.742 --> 00:38:01.003]  I think?
[00:38:15.853 --> 00:38:16.574]  It really is.
[00:38:16.674 --> 00:38:27.461]  It sets a lot of patterns for what we're seeing now, where the old established order wants to go back to the world where they had this incredible control over what you saw and what you thought, what you read.
[00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:34.046]  I mean, we're literally seeing they're trying to go back to the days of the Cold War with Russia, and they're not getting any traction with it.
[00:38:35.009 --> 00:38:35.709]  Absolutely.
[00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:47.934]  Let's get into the economy briefly and where you see that going and a little bit about Obama's plan for the economy, which again is a bunch of corporate payoffs, a trillion bucks to basically buy off.
[00:38:49.275 --> 00:38:51.916]  They've already given the banks their $8.5 trillion and counting.
[00:38:51.936 --> 00:38:54.597]  We haven't gotten new numbers in three months, in three weeks.
[00:38:55.277 --> 00:38:59.179]  But in the first couple of months of the bailout it was $8.5 trillion according to the AP Bloomberg.
[00:38:59.759 --> 00:39:01.019]  And other publications.
[00:39:01.319 --> 00:39:04.780]  And then we have the private Federal Reserve telling Congress, we're not going to tell you what's going on.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.701]  And then a board of governors, a member of the Federal Reserve, says we're not even allowed to know what's happening.
[00:39:10.101 --> 00:39:12.881]  Only the Fed in New York and the Treasury are doing this.
[00:39:13.181 --> 00:39:15.582]  And we've been told the War Powers Act has been implemented.
[00:39:15.782 --> 00:39:17.482]  And then that's in Bloomberg and AP.
[00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:20.743]  I mean, we're under financial receivership dictatorship.
[00:39:20.983 --> 00:39:26.584]  But if we're able to expose that, it can't stand because it's so criminal on the face of it.
[00:39:26.624 --> 00:39:28.064]  So how do we break the trance
[00:39:28.604 --> 00:39:34.959]  The public's partially awake right now, but how do we break the trance and let them realize the magnitude of what's really happening?
[00:39:36.124 --> 00:39:42.268]  Well, I think it's kind of automatic, because we're looking at probably 11% unemployment in the next couple of months.
[00:39:42.588 --> 00:39:48.711]  We're probably looking at 20 to 25% unemployment by the middle of 2009, and that's depression level.
[00:39:49.172 --> 00:40:02.860]  And the government is grudgingly admitting we're in a recession, but I think most Americans are aware we're in a serious, serious trouble, and we're seeing situations where Bernie Madoff has just underscored the fact that a lot of the game-playing we've been seeing in Wall Street
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.120]  And he's still out on the street every day!
[00:40:24.745 --> 00:40:26.586]  The judge would not put him in jail.
[00:40:26.687 --> 00:40:39.596]  I think they want him to leave the country because what we're hearing from other sources is that a full investigation into his little scam is going to reveal that most of these other Wall Street investment groups were also running ponds.
[00:40:39.696 --> 00:40:40.876]  Well, that's already admitted.
[00:40:40.896 --> 00:40:45.098]  I mean, every major bank in the world had investments with him.
[00:40:45.138 --> 00:40:46.558]  It's more like $100 billion.
[00:40:47.118 --> 00:40:55.601]  And they knew fully, and people were telling the Securities and Exchange Commission back in 1999-98 that this was a fraud, and of course they didn't investigate.
[00:40:55.881 --> 00:40:59.622]  The FBI will go set you up if you don't pay $10,000 in taxes to the IRS.
[00:40:59.842 --> 00:41:02.423]  You write your checks, by the way, to the Bernie Madoff Federal Reserve.
[00:41:03.223 --> 00:41:06.244]  But if this guy steals $100 billion, there's no problem.
[00:41:07.287 --> 00:41:11.110]  Yeah, because the people at the top were all neck deep in it.
[00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.272]  They don't want you to know where that $100 billion went.
[00:41:14.652 --> 00:41:21.617]  So what they're going to do is they're going to pay off the losses again with a taxpayer-funded bailout.
[00:41:21.937 --> 00:41:23.058]  But that's the real danger.
[00:41:23.338 --> 00:41:25.820]  That's the real danger, is that these guys are cornered.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.781]  They're going for broke.
[00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:29.042]  They control through fraud the world's central banks.
[00:41:29.303 --> 00:41:30.964]  They've bought up most of the economy through fraud.
[00:41:30.984 --> 00:41:32.645]  They've debased the currency.
[00:41:32.945 --> 00:41:36.247]  They've moved into the real assets.
[00:41:37.108 --> 00:41:41.171]  And they're leaving a rear-guard police state here, and it's accelerating globalism.
[00:41:41.551 --> 00:41:43.212]  I mean, I've talked to people that work at IBM.
[00:41:43.232 --> 00:41:44.573]  They've already had massive layoffs.
[00:41:44.853 --> 00:41:48.936]  They're now literally telling everybody, OK, you're only part-time trainers now.
[00:41:49.236 --> 00:41:55.380]  Here are all your end-in replacements who are making seven bucks an hour, and you're all going to be fired in a few months.
[00:41:55.981 --> 00:41:57.021]  So you can take it or leave it.
[00:41:57.602 --> 00:42:06.968]  I mean, I don't think the public realizes that through this crisis, the race to the bottom is now going to be accelerated, and that this collapse will actually centralize more power in the hands
[00:42:07.488 --> 00:42:17.373]  Well, you know, I think what the American people need to realize is that all of this debt that they are in was manufactured with counterfeit printed up money.
[00:42:17.813 --> 00:42:27.397]  I mean, the house that you're living in today is exactly the same house it was 20, 30 years ago, but somehow, because of all this extra money that was printed up out of thin air by the Federal Reserve,
[00:42:27.837 --> 00:42:32.561]  It's value and the debt that you owe on it is now much, much, much greater.
[00:42:32.861 --> 00:42:42.067]  And this is over and above the fact that over the course of a 30-year mortgage, you're going to pay the banks five times what the house actually costs by the time you add up all the interest payments.
[00:42:42.668 --> 00:42:45.890]  So we are, as a nation, we have lost our way.
[00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:51.995]  We have wandered away from the making of products to make money, and we made money the product itself.
[00:42:52.515 --> 00:43:02.578]  And the things that are used to create wealth, like houses, cars, TV sets, automobiles, all these things we used to make, it's trivialized, it's marginalized.
[00:43:02.958 --> 00:43:04.079]  Our whole economy is based on it.
[00:43:04.099 --> 00:43:11.001]  Yeah, we've got the fiat economy eating the real economy, and then they've taken the fiat money when it still had value and bought everything up.
[00:43:11.261 --> 00:43:18.363]  Now we're left to not just have an economy, but to owe this fiat money to the very bankers that stole it from us.
[00:43:18.463 --> 00:43:21.584]  I mean, folks, this is just indescribable.
[00:43:22.324 --> 00:43:23.486]  Mike, I've studied history.
[00:43:23.506 --> 00:43:24.847]  I've studied the history of financing.
[00:43:25.448 --> 00:43:30.694]  And there have been similar things done on a smaller scale in third world countries by the very same gaggle of money changers.
[00:43:31.235 --> 00:43:36.762]  But I've never seen anything even approaching in the arrogance, the openness, the wild-eyedness.
[00:43:37.323 --> 00:43:38.244]  Again, they're going for broke.
[00:43:39.486 --> 00:43:52.100]  They absolutely are, and I think what we're seeing here is the looting of the nation prior to its ultimate collapse, and everybody's out to make a fast buck and fill their own pockets and get the money offshore.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:58.386]  And again, that wild wildcatting at the end as it's imploding makes them even be more aggressive.
[00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:08.952]  Absolutely, because they're realizing that the normal mechanisms of law enforcement, it's like what they're doing with Bernie Madoff, $50 billion and he's still allowed to stay at home.
[00:44:09.332 --> 00:44:13.553]  The message has gone out, loot the nation at will, nothing will happen to you.
[00:44:14.273 --> 00:44:16.234]  It's open season on the American taxpayer.
[00:44:16.314 --> 00:44:21.535]  And again, they said three weeks ago at least $50 billion, now they're saying, oh, it's much higher, it could be more than $100 billion.
[00:44:23.052 --> 00:44:24.554]  They still don't know where it all leads.
[00:44:24.594 --> 00:44:34.747]  There are still people walking around who think their money was safe in federally regulated banks, not knowing those federally regulated banks were putting their money into Bernie Madoff's pyramid scheme.
[00:44:34.807 --> 00:44:35.989]  Well, you hinted at this.
[00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:37.631]  You hinted at this.
[00:44:37.931 --> 00:44:40.695]  Yeah, knowing it was a Ponzi scheme, but they were insiders, so they'd be protected.
[00:44:41.857 --> 00:45:02.035]  And that's that, look, his sons, this company, this guy wasn't running, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of investment over the years, 50 to whatever, you know, 100 billion, you know, at the end of the musical chairs, the folks that didn't get chairs, but hundreds of billions over the decades, founder of the NASDAQ, formerly its chairman,
[00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:12.998]  I mean, he's really taking the fall right now, claiming he created all the fake computer databases, he sent out all the fake forms, he filed all the fake forms with the government.
[00:45:13.178 --> 00:45:14.680]  I mean, that's absolute bull.
[00:45:15.703 --> 00:45:16.663]  It absolutely is.
[00:45:16.743 --> 00:45:25.546]  I think his sons turned him in so that they could stay out of jail, but they're as guilty as anybody else, and Madoff is going to get off free because they're already planning an insanity defense.
[00:45:26.146 --> 00:45:43.631]  He had so much money, he just went crazy, and that's why he did this Ponzi scheme, and he really didn't know that he was doing wrong, and they're going to do this little tearful thing, and they're going to get him out of jail, and it's just going to be this incredible miscarriage of justice, and the hundred billion dollars losses is going to be dumped on the working-class Americans,
[00:45:45.112 --> 00:46:05.547]  Like everything else, and what Americans need to realize right now is the sum total of all these bailouts and repays and coverage and compensations dumped on the American taxpayer already works out to an additional $100,000 per American in added tax burden that you're going to have to pay that you will get nothing back for.
[00:46:05.567 --> 00:46:06.228]  Let me stop you.
[00:46:06.728 --> 00:46:08.289]  That's currently what's owed.
[00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.592]  If we paid it today, the interest is racking up.
[00:46:13.719 --> 00:46:15.040]  Absolutely.
[00:46:15.421 --> 00:46:18.343]  I mean, that's obligations versus what's currently owed.
[00:46:18.563 --> 00:46:19.464]  Let's go to phone calls.
[00:46:19.564 --> 00:46:20.565]  Ronnie in Texas.
[00:46:20.965 --> 00:46:21.786]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:46:21.826 --> 00:46:22.146]  Welcome.
[00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:27.650]  Thank you, sir.
[00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:28.231]  With U.S.
[00:46:28.251 --> 00:46:34.836]  taxpayer dollars in Gaza now, Israeli thugs continually commit collective punishment, which is a war crime, people!
[00:46:36.577 --> 00:46:36.878]  Why?
[00:46:36.918 --> 00:46:42.522]  Because that bigoted, socialistic, totalitarian, criminal regime of Israel supposedly believes God has
[00:46:42.964 --> 00:46:46.405]  Quote, chosen their own form of bigotry over all others.
[00:46:46.885 --> 00:46:47.345]  And why?
[00:46:47.385 --> 00:46:48.685]  Because you and me as U.S.
[00:46:48.745 --> 00:46:52.026]  taxpayers continually pay them to kill people.
[00:46:52.726 --> 00:46:53.866]  So what's going to stop that?
[00:46:53.926 --> 00:46:57.807]  It's when you and me, taxpayers, stop the payments for killing.
[00:46:58.347 --> 00:46:59.607]  It may slow down.
[00:46:59.627 --> 00:47:01.967]  At least our collective guilt as U.S.
[00:47:02.007 --> 00:47:04.468]  taxpayers will finally begin to lessen.
[00:47:04.528 --> 00:47:06.108]  But who can stop the killing?
[00:47:06.148 --> 00:47:09.409]  Those evil stooges for Israel, you and me, U.S.
[00:47:10.009 --> 00:47:10.509]  taxpayers,
[00:47:11.024 --> 00:47:13.167]  Must just say no to the status quo.
[00:47:28.388 --> 00:47:30.368]  And most of them, teachers and children.
[00:47:30.989 --> 00:47:32.409]  Your comments on that, Mike Rivera?
[00:47:33.009 --> 00:47:38.330]  Yeah, this is the second UN school that Israel has destroyed in Gaza, I think in the last 24 hours.
[00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:43.651]  And it's absolutely evident that Israel is not targeting just Hamas.
[00:47:43.671 --> 00:47:44.971]  They're killing everything that moves.
[00:47:45.252 --> 00:47:46.772]  They're using incendiary bombs.
[00:47:46.932 --> 00:47:48.592]  They want to drive out observers.
[00:47:49.252 --> 00:47:51.333]  They've said they're targeting press and international observers.
[00:47:51.373 --> 00:47:51.613]  Go ahead.
[00:47:52.313 --> 00:47:54.333]  Yeah, they already got the press out.
[00:47:54.934 --> 00:48:00.575]  The remaining media in Gaza are confined to a media city of Israel's designation.
[00:48:00.915 --> 00:48:04.876]  They're trying now to block the Twitter and SMS messages that are coming out of Gaza.
[00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:08.457]  They're trying to completely isolate it so that the world does not see what they do.
[00:48:08.497 --> 00:48:16.359]  They kept out the International Red Cross, and the Red Cross were allowed into the German concentration camps during World War II, but Israel won't let them in.
[00:48:16.679 --> 00:48:18.079]  What are they hiding?
[00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:19.841]  Well, we know.
[00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:21.082]  They're running a siege.
[00:48:21.102 --> 00:48:22.923]  They're leveling those areas like Fallujah.
[00:48:23.483 --> 00:48:24.644]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:48:24.684 --> 00:48:27.125]  Peggy in PA, you're on the air with Mike Rivero.
[00:48:27.845 --> 00:48:28.205]  Hello.
[00:48:28.946 --> 00:48:35.849]  The reason I called is that I would like a comment from either of you as to how I should steer some research.
[00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:46.635]  I was of the age in the 1980s when I noticed the goddess movement come into popular culture in Europe and in America.
[00:48:48.047 --> 00:48:50.769]  Really didn't go anywhere, sort of fizzled out and disappeared.
[00:48:51.449 --> 00:49:01.635]  And I have noticed, based frankly, Alex, upon learning the techniques that you're guessing you use to investigate, you know, that you have to look in certain areas.
[00:49:02.175 --> 00:49:07.638]  And I've noticed that there was, it seems to me that there was a government effort
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.761]  Or an effort from some corner to completely eradicate it from the public consciousness.
[00:49:12.781 --> 00:49:14.642]  You just don't find any comments about it.
[00:49:14.682 --> 00:49:16.502]  Even on the internet, there's really nothing.
[00:49:17.383 --> 00:49:18.323]  Goddess movement?
[00:49:18.983 --> 00:49:21.664]  Yeah, the goddess spirituality idea.
[00:49:21.764 --> 00:49:22.964]  Well, I mean, that's everywhere.
[00:49:22.984 --> 00:49:24.565]  That's what the masons worship.
[00:49:24.865 --> 00:49:29.386]  That's what they worship at Skull and Bones is the goddess Eulogia, the goddess Columbia for the United States.
[00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.067]  Well, let me refine it, Alex.
[00:49:31.207 --> 00:49:32.607]  One thing that they always
[00:49:33.207 --> 00:49:56.207]  I know for a fact, because of my own examination of old textbooks and so on, and also writings from the 19th century, is that in Europe, before the Warlike Tribes came in, all over Europe, the goddesses went back to like 20-25,000 BC, and there really was no god.
[00:49:56.268 --> 00:49:58.730]  In other words, it was a very peaceful world.
[00:49:59.403 --> 00:50:00.683]  Yeah, listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:50:00.703 --> 00:50:01.484]  I know what you're talking about.
[00:50:01.784 --> 00:50:05.125]  This goes into the Merovingians and all that, and it's actually the Illuminati religion.
[00:50:05.965 --> 00:50:10.406]  You know, they worship the female side of the God, and so the male side of the God.
[00:50:10.446 --> 00:50:15.828]  I mean, we're not really getting into that today, but fine, you're welcome to bring that subject up.
[00:50:15.868 --> 00:50:18.489]  That's not really... Mike, would you like to comment on that?
[00:50:19.352 --> 00:50:21.433]  Well, I'm in agreement with you, Alex.
[00:50:21.573 --> 00:50:27.435]  I don't know where this lady is researching, but the whole goddess mythology is all over the internet.
[00:50:28.015 --> 00:50:34.397]  My wife actually refers to it a lot in her creative works, so I don't think there's anything about it being suppressed or repressed.
[00:50:34.457 --> 00:50:36.778]  It's just a case of fashions and trends.
[00:50:37.098 --> 00:50:39.339]  It was popular for a while, now people have moved on.
[00:50:40.481 --> 00:50:41.342]  Yeah.
[00:50:41.582 --> 00:50:43.283]  We're going to go to break here.
[00:50:43.363 --> 00:50:44.244]  Final segment with Mike Rivera.
[00:50:44.264 --> 00:50:46.165]  We'll come back to Joe, Sean, and Chad.
[00:50:46.205 --> 00:50:48.807]  This hour is really going by very quickly.

[00:51:20.518 --> 00:51:22.540]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.162]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[00:51:26.462 --> 00:51:27.143]  Be smart.
[00:51:27.403 --> 00:51:28.103]  Be safe.
[00:51:28.383 --> 00:51:30.345]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[00:52:12.341 --> 00:52:12.721]  Call today!
[00:52:17.051 --> 00:52:19.072]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:52:19.192 --> 00:52:21.614]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:52:21.634 --> 00:52:24.216]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:52:24.236 --> 00:52:25.437]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:52:25.457 --> 00:52:27.058]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:52:27.178 --> 00:52:29.960]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:35.003]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the UNICEF?
[00:52:43.334 --> 00:52:48.237]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:52:49.258 --> 00:52:50.639]  An inside job?
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.802]  How dare you?
[00:52:56.082 --> 00:52:59.505]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:52:59.525 --> 00:53:01.586]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:53:06.773 --> 00:53:08.816]  Truth Rising.
[00:53:08.856 --> 00:53:11.440]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:13.723]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:53:13.983 --> 00:53:16.447]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:20.762]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:53:20.822 --> 00:53:26.465]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:53:26.565 --> 00:53:30.607]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:33.188]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[00:53:33.348 --> 00:53:39.531]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and
[00:53:39.531 --> 00:53:40.171]  I think so.
[00:53:56.476 --> 00:53:56.916]  I don't know.
[00:54:53.797 --> 00:54:57.740]  Coming straight on for the Tyrants!
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:58.741]  Liberty!
[00:54:58.821 --> 00:54:59.881]  Movement is strong!
[00:55:05.225 --> 00:55:06.186]  Coming straight on!
[00:55:08.207 --> 00:55:10.189]  All right, let's go back to the calls here.
[00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:15.252]  Let's talk to Lori in Hawaii.
[00:55:15.933 --> 00:55:18.194]  Lori, you're on the air with Mike Rivero.
[00:55:19.735 --> 00:55:20.216]  Hey Alex.
[00:55:21.144 --> 00:55:22.444]  Hi, just a quick background.
[00:55:22.745 --> 00:55:24.025]  I'm from Kauai, Hawaii.
[00:55:24.145 --> 00:55:25.646]  I have an 18-year-old.
[00:55:25.886 --> 00:55:28.887]  It's the hip-hop generation that's going to wake up America, too.
[00:55:31.408 --> 00:55:33.228]  For eight years, I voted for Bush.
[00:55:33.288 --> 00:55:36.470]  I supported the war, and then I finally turned off my TV and found out the truth.
[00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:39.291]  I've got to get un-brainwashed.
[00:55:39.371 --> 00:55:42.632]  My question is, aren't we supposed to support Israel?
[00:55:42.732 --> 00:55:47.254]  I'm a Christian, and I think our American people are led to believe that.
[00:55:47.414 --> 00:55:49.074]  But is it the government that's corrupt?
[00:55:49.134 --> 00:55:50.455]  I watched Fabled Enemies.
[00:55:51.643 --> 00:55:52.644]  I've watched it all.
[00:55:53.785 --> 00:56:05.213]  It took my 18 year old 7 years to convince me to find out the truth and now I've been researching on the internet and everything like that so I wanted to see if you could direct me to some good information for research.
[00:56:05.253 --> 00:56:06.314]  Let me comment on this.
[00:56:07.855 --> 00:56:09.716]  I don't hate Israel.
[00:56:10.157 --> 00:56:10.937]  I don't hate England.
[00:56:10.957 --> 00:56:11.778]  I don't hate Germany.
[00:56:11.818 --> 00:56:12.638]  I don't hate China.
[00:56:13.199 --> 00:56:17.262]  Most governments throughout history are run by groups that want power and control.
[00:56:18.932 --> 00:56:22.315]  And then we'll get Mike's final comment on this, because we're almost out of time.
[00:56:24.336 --> 00:56:27.078]  What happens here is this is just more colonialism.
[00:56:27.478 --> 00:56:33.342]  The Ottoman Empire fell after World War I. They lost control of what was Palestine, what was on the map was Palestine.
[00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:46.892]  And then British Zionists funded, the Rothschilds funded, that's public, it's admitted in Israel, everything's dedicated to them, to go in and carry out terror attacks to kick the British out, and then to kick the Arabs out.
[00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:53.700]  And so then, around that same time, there was financing and funding in U.S.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:57:03.794]  churches by the Council of Churches, now the World Council of Churches, to create this new religion based around, you know, that this is Israel,
[00:57:04.475 --> 00:57:10.398]  And that the Antichrist is going to attack Israel and that we have to get behind Israel or we're going to hell.
[00:57:10.758 --> 00:57:17.782]  When my Bible in Revelations and Daniel and Ezekiel says that Israel didn't do what they were supposed to do so they were kicked out.
[00:57:18.182 --> 00:57:20.864]  And that the Antichrist will go to Israel and say he's God.
[00:57:21.744 --> 00:57:30.006]  Okay, and so, I mean, just from that perspective, you want to argue it on a religious basis, it's completely twisted compared to what the Bible actually says.
[00:57:30.586 --> 00:57:35.007]  Does that mean I'm even supporting the Muslims, or I want them to, you know, kill all the Jews and kick them out?
[00:57:35.027 --> 00:57:35.367]  No!
[00:57:35.807 --> 00:57:44.029]  The point is, Israel's mopping up and pushing everybody out, and is very secular, and doesn't allow Christians to preach in Israel, and that's not reported here either.
[00:57:44.289 --> 00:57:45.830]  Mike Rivero, and I appreciate your call.
[00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:47.990]  You can call back another time, we can talk more about it.
[00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:49.251]  I'm sorry, we're just out of time.
[00:57:49.271 --> 00:57:50.471]  The clock, another guest coming up.
[00:57:51.591 --> 00:57:53.312]  In closing, Mike Rivero, comment on that.
[00:57:54.033 --> 00:58:17.948]  Just real quick, I mean there's no question that Israel has successfully exploited the religious beliefs of American Christians for purely propagandistic purposes to build support for Israel's actions and a lot of people are, as this caller is very confused, because they think what is going on now in Gaza is somehow part of the biblical Israel of two thousand years ago and there really is no connection.
[00:58:18.048 --> 00:58:19.069]  It is a false link
[00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:26.852]  Fostered by the current government of Israel, purely to build political support for what otherwise would be seen as violations of the Ten Commandments.
[00:58:27.152 --> 00:58:43.940]  And then meanwhile, we see the Israeli lobby aggressively going after the Second Amendment here, trying to set up warrantless searches, police state, and really pushing for anti-democratic moves in the United States, kind of capturing us as their Hessian mercenary supply chain.
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:50.106]  Mike Rivero, I want to thank you for coming on with us, and we'll talk to you again the same time next month.
[00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:51.247]  Thank you so much.
[00:58:51.968 --> 00:58:53.049]  Thank you for having me again.
[00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:53.790]  You bet.
[00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:54.570]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:58.354 --> 00:58:59.756]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:59.796 --> 00:59:02.258]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:13.554]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:59:13.934 --> 00:59:15.896]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:59:16.576 --> 00:59:17.597]  But who is the enemy?
[00:59:18.117 --> 00:59:18.637]  Bin Laden.
[00:59:18.918 --> 00:59:19.838]  This is his ammo.
[00:59:19.858 --> 00:59:21.259]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:59:21.279 --> 00:59:22.980]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:30.025]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:59:30.425 --> 00:59:30.865]  Some U.S.
[00:59:30.905 --> 00:59:36.589]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:59:37.249 --> 00:59:40.752]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:59:41.132 --> 00:59:50.978]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:59:51.218 --> 00:59:51.979]  Fabled Enemies.

[01:00:00.224 --> 01:00:03.567]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:11.452]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:11.932 --> 01:00:14.774]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.338 --> 01:00:21.998]  Big Brother.
[01:00:22.638 --> 01:00:23.699]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:24.419 --> 01:00:25.520]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.001]  You want answers?
[01:00:27.741 --> 01:00:28.662]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:28.682 --> 01:00:33.024]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:33.044 --> 01:00:37.547]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.645 --> 01:00:42.226]  Well, I have read his writings for years.
[01:00:43.827 --> 01:00:47.989]  And Ron Paul says this is one of the people that's taught him much of what he knows.
[01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:53.652]  This is his first time on air with us, but I hope it's the first of many visits.
[01:00:54.753 --> 01:01:05.458]  Dr. Edwin Vieira Jr., Ph.D., J.D., holds four degrees from Harvard College, A.M., Ph.D., Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and J.D., Harvard Law School.
[01:01:05.478 --> 01:01:08.960]  For more than 30 years, he's practiced law with emphasis on constitutional issues,
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:16.562]  He is also one of our country's most eminent constitutional attorneys, having brought four cases that were accepted by the Supreme Court and having won three of them.
[01:01:17.042 --> 01:01:32.447]  In the Supreme Court of the United States, he successfully argued, or briefed, the case leading to the landmark decision, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson, Communications Workers of America v. Beck, which established constitutional and statutory limitations on the use
[01:01:33.127 --> 01:01:41.893]  of labor unions in which private and the public sectors may apply fees extracted from the non-union workers as a condition of their employment.
[01:01:42.653 --> 01:01:52.080]  He's one of the world's foremost authorities about the role of the Constitution as it relates to money and has written numerous monograms and articles in scholarly journals and lectured throughout the country.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:02:01.186]  His most recent work on money and banking is the two-volume pieces of eight that Ron Paul cites, The Monetary Powers and Disabilities of the United States Constitution.
[01:02:02.346 --> 01:02:09.751]  The most comprehensive study in the existence of American monetary law and history viewed from a constitutional perspective available at piecesofeight.us.
[01:02:10.191 --> 01:02:17.135]  He's also the co-author of Gnome de Plume, or the political novel Cashmaker, a Federal Affair 2000.
[01:02:17.636 --> 01:02:19.137]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:02:19.457 --> 01:02:22.899]  Sir, I didn't do a pre-interview with you, but I want to get into the real history of the Second Amendment.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:30.284]  You know, a brief history of what our real monetary system should be versus the private offshore Federal Reserve.
[01:02:30.644 --> 01:02:39.530]  And then, of course, your overall view of the police state, the classical police state that is unfolding in this nation.
[01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:43.292]  So, Mr. Vieira, it's great to have you on with us.
[01:02:43.933 --> 01:02:45.574]  It's my pleasure to be with you, Alex.
[01:02:46.034 --> 01:02:46.935]  Where would you like to begin?
[01:02:47.637 --> 01:02:50.319]  Well, we're going to break here in about three minutes and come back in a long segment.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.364]  Tell folks about your awakening, some of the work you've done, and some of the things you think are most important right now.
[01:02:56.425 --> 01:03:09.597]  Well, going in reverse order from what you listed, we are seeing the development, quite clearly intentional development, of a top-down police state apparatus out of Washington, D.C.
[01:03:10.576 --> 01:03:24.689]  I do not believe that this thing was set up originally because of the 9-11 event, the so-called international terrorism problem, because we know the Patriot Act, the first version of the Patriot Act, was drawn up long before 9-11.
[01:03:24.709 --> 01:03:30.534]  They were simply waiting for some episode to justify putting it into legislation.
[01:03:31.278 --> 01:03:42.482]  I think what they're really anticipating, and we're seeing it unfolding now in the markets, is the breakdown of this basically corrupt and unsustainable monetary and banking system centered around the Federal Reserve.
[01:03:43.182 --> 01:03:58.227]  And they know when this comes down in a world system entirely based upon central bank fiat currency and credit expansion as a method for creating money, that they're going to see social, economic, and political dislocations
[01:03:59.056 --> 01:03:59.316]  I don't
[01:04:16.392 --> 01:04:18.832]  With essentially police-type controls.
[01:04:19.333 --> 01:04:26.554]  And that's why this whole Homeland Security paranoia has been generated out of Washington, is to prepare the groundwork for that.
[01:04:27.274 --> 01:04:32.195]  On the one hand, in developing the agencies and forces that are necessary to put it into effect.
[01:04:32.595 --> 01:04:44.657]  Then on the other hand, creating the psychological acceptance, acquiescence, if you will, on the basis of which the population will simply be expected to roll over for this kind of control.
[01:04:45.365 --> 01:04:57.830]  And ultimately this is directed towards, whether intentionally or not, it's certainly going to result in the destruction of our basic constitutional form of government and all the freedoms and economic prosperity that go with it.
[01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:05.993]  Alright, Dr. Edwin Vieira is our guest and we'll be back with Dr. Edwin Vieira right after this quick break.
[01:05:06.953 --> 01:05:12.916]  And we're going to break down what this top-down police state is going to be like and how do we try to avert it or reverse it.
[01:05:13.256 --> 01:05:13.716]  Stay with us.
[01:05:17.202 --> 01:05:20.185]  So you finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[01:05:20.505 --> 01:05:22.627]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[01:05:23.087 --> 01:05:24.148]  Why settle for less?
[01:05:24.508 --> 01:05:25.769]  There is an alternative.
[01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:27.611]  InternetGrocer.net.

[01:05:35.257 --> 01:05:38.060]  Indulge in real canned meats and real canned butter.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:45.141]  Storable meals from InternetGrocer.net will bring such variety and flavor you won't be able to tell you're actually eating storable food.
[01:05:45.321 --> 01:05:47.382]  You can purchase by the can or by the case.
[01:05:47.662 --> 01:05:50.362]  Choose a variety pack or an entire year's worth of food.
[01:05:50.622 --> 01:05:55.763]  InternetGrocer.net has non-hybrid seeds that will produce delicious food for you and your family.
[01:05:56.023 --> 01:05:57.644]  Ensure your food supply for years.
[01:05:58.044 --> 01:06:00.744]  Find out just how delicious storable food can be.
[01:06:00.984 --> 01:06:01.184]  Call 903-356-6443.
[01:06:04.185 --> 01:06:07.267]  That's 903-356-6443.
[01:06:07.587 --> 01:06:08.447]  Open from 9 a.m.
[01:06:08.467 --> 01:06:09.147]  to 6 p.m.
[01:06:09.207 --> 01:06:10.188]  Central Standard Time.
[01:06:10.448 --> 01:06:13.469]  Or shop online at internet-grocer.net.
[01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:16.291]  Again, that's internet-grocer.net.
[01:06:16.791 --> 01:06:18.452]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:06:18.752 --> 01:06:22.214]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:06:22.374 --> 01:06:24.194]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:27.556]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:06:27.856 --> 01:06:31.698]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[01:06:31.698 --> 01:06:32.078]  We're good to go.
[01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.506]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[01:07:03.566 --> 01:07:11.534]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them a date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:36.545]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen inactive like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[01:07:37.026 --> 01:07:38.967]  Well snap out of it, we now have a deadline.
[01:07:39.467 --> 01:07:40.948]  Joe Biden said it's gonna happen.
[01:07:41.508 --> 01:07:44.950]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press
[01:07:45.515 --> 01:07:52.818]  And pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[01:07:53.378 --> 01:07:59.080]  Well, I take the general of this word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:04.422]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[01:08:04.962 --> 01:08:08.743]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[01:08:09.303 --> 01:08:10.524]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:08:18.286 --> 01:08:24.308]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:24.909 --> 01:08:27.950]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:32.351 --> 01:08:35.433]  Dr. Edwin Vieira is our guest for stations that just joined us.
[01:08:35.893 --> 01:08:41.375]  We were getting into where this top constitutional scholar has won three times at the Supreme Court.
[01:08:43.561 --> 01:08:55.010]  The top-down police state, the classical police state they've borrowed from the Nazis, the Communists, the Inquisitors of old, all of it integrated into this surveillance grid, this total federalization.
[01:08:55.470 --> 01:09:00.374]  They smoke screen the public saying, oh, this whole police state's to fight Al-Qaeda, Al-Cieda.
[01:09:00.935 --> 01:09:03.236]  And then now they're saying, oh, we're going to use 20,000 U.S.
[01:09:03.277 --> 01:09:03.577]  troops.
[01:09:03.777 --> 01:09:07.880]  Oh, Obama's going to have a million-person corps as big as the military, domestic spies.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.582]  You're going to have to be drafted 18 to 24 to serve the government.
[01:09:13.104 --> 01:09:17.686]  This is all happening and now they're admitting that they set it all up for the financial collapse.
[01:09:17.746 --> 01:09:19.307]  So we're going over this.
[01:09:19.327 --> 01:09:20.968]  There's no more denial here.
[01:09:21.588 --> 01:09:30.612]  They've now in their scholarly publications and in Pentagon directives and Army War College documents admit this is happening and that they'll even use Canadian, Mexican troops, foreign troops.
[01:09:31.752 --> 01:09:35.355]  And then the Congress earlier last year said, why aren't we being informed?
[01:09:35.395 --> 01:09:39.879]  And the President said, PDD 51, you're not involved in continuity of government.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.764]  So we've got one of the preeminent scholars on the line with us, Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[01:09:46.144 --> 01:09:47.085]  Sir, please continue.
[01:09:47.966 --> 01:09:55.352]  Let's start there with the entire police state, what makes a police state, and then hopefully how we stop it.
[01:09:56.533 --> 01:10:03.076]  Well, let's go back to the antithesis of the police state, so we'll have a baseline to work from, and of course that's the Constitution of the United States.
[01:10:03.815 --> 01:10:11.757]  Which is based on principles antithetical and really contradictory in every sense to the concept of a top-down police state.
[01:10:11.898 --> 01:10:20.080]  The top-down police state is talking about control from the top down and obedience from the bottom up and of course our constitutional system works in exactly the opposite manner.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:32.204]  It's liberty at the bottom and control coming from the people and then obedience in principle at least by the representatives whether elected or appointed at the upper levels of government, state or national.
[01:10:32.978 --> 01:10:46.315]  If you look at the Constitution, and I always like to say, listen, when something goes wrong with the machinery that you're using, the smart individual turns to the Book of Instructions, and the Book of Instructions for our system is the Constitution of the United States.
[01:10:46.715 --> 01:10:50.300]  The only place in the Constitution where it refers to security
[01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:52.171]  Is in the Second Amendment.
[01:10:52.271 --> 01:10:56.217]  A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[01:10:56.697 --> 01:10:58.600]  And it's a particular kind of security.
[01:10:59.141 --> 01:11:00.803]  It's not police state security.
[01:11:00.843 --> 01:11:03.147]  It's not all embracing welfare state security.
[01:11:03.467 --> 01:11:05.650]  It's the security of a free state.
[01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:06.512]  That's the goal.
[01:11:07.441 --> 01:11:14.407]  Instrumentally, Second Amendment tells us that something called the militia is necessary for that purpose.
[01:11:14.567 --> 01:11:15.527]  Again, very interesting.
[01:11:15.848 --> 01:11:21.992]  That's the only place in the Constitution at the present time where it says that anything is necessary for any purpose.
[01:11:22.053 --> 01:11:25.075]  It doesn't say Congress is necessary, the President is necessary, the Supreme Court is necessary.
[01:11:25.395 --> 01:11:32.501]  It says that a well-regulated militia is necessary for this ultimately important purpose of securing a free state.
[01:11:32.881 --> 01:11:35.383]  So if we were to take that term, Homeland Security,
[01:11:36.255 --> 01:11:43.226]  And pretend for the moment that it's not loaded from the point of view of the people who want to put a police state into operation.
[01:11:43.446 --> 01:11:44.809]  Just take that as a neutral term.
[01:11:44.849 --> 01:11:46.211]  We'd say, well, this constitution tells us.
[01:11:46.897 --> 01:11:48.658]  How to provide for homeland security.
[01:11:49.019 --> 01:11:51.721]  We want homeland security in the sense of a security-free state.
[01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:55.144]  We need this thing called a well-regulated militia.
[01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:59.827]  And the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[01:11:59.887 --> 01:12:00.988]  I mean, it's right there.
[01:12:01.048 --> 01:12:01.609]  It's us.
[01:12:01.969 --> 01:12:09.695]  They try to play with the definition of a well-regulated militia, claiming it's, as you know, the 1906 National Guard, when it has nothing to do with that.
[01:12:09.755 --> 01:12:13.738]  It is the armed population against street thugs and a tyrannical government.
[01:12:13.979 --> 01:12:15.400]  Not just our right, but our duty
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:34.293]  Well, that's precisely correct, because if you take yourself back to the time of ratification of the Constitution, now it's 1787 or the Bill of Rights, 1791, and you ask yourself, what did that term, militia, mean to those people?
[01:12:34.573 --> 01:12:37.636]  Clearly, there's no definition of it in the Constitution.
[01:12:38.056 --> 01:12:43.600]  Most of the terms in the Constitution of great consequence are not defined, because they didn't need to be defined.
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.261]  People understood precisely what they meant.
[01:12:45.936 --> 01:12:52.061]  At that point in time, every adult American in this country knew what a well-regulated militia was.
[01:12:52.281 --> 01:13:01.488]  Because we were a paramilitary armed camp of French terrorism and businessmen and the freest people in the world.
[01:13:01.969 --> 01:13:06.432]  Well, they were all members in every state in the Union, all the 13 states.
[01:13:07.981 --> 01:13:08.281]  I think?
[01:13:29.252 --> 01:13:48.788]  Freed slaves were allowed to participate in this, and their basic principle was precisely what you suggested, that every adult female had a responsibility, not simply a right, but a duty to be armed, to be trained, to be ready to be called out in any kind of emergency.
[01:13:48.868 --> 01:13:57.315]  They used to use the term alarm, was the specific statutory term that you see used for these emergencies that we would call Homeland Security problems.
[01:13:58.334 --> 01:14:02.018]  And it extended across the entire community.
[01:14:02.458 --> 01:14:17.113]  So you didn't have a separation in the provision of what we would call Homeland Security between the people themselves and some elite group of police or Homeland Security agencies or what have you that have been developed in more recent times.
[01:14:17.713 --> 01:14:21.097]  And this was fundamentally important, not simply for the provision of security,
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.802]  But for the maintenance of true democracy.
[01:14:25.842 --> 01:14:31.686]  That is, the people who were going to be in control of this situation were the people themselves.
[01:14:31.746 --> 01:14:34.728]  We the people, as the Constitution identifies us.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:53.801]  Right.
[01:14:54.221 --> 01:15:05.428]  And of course, the important thing I think that we've lost in this whole concept is if you talk to the average person about the militia, they do give you what I would call the stereotypical answer, oh, that's the National Guard.
[01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:09.430]  Well, the National Guard wasn't formed until it actually began in 1903.
[01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:12.732]  That was the first statute, the so-called Dick Act, that was passed.
[01:15:12.772 --> 01:15:17.235]  So it's about 150 years removed from the actual constitutional militia.
[01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:28.213]  But the main problem that I see is people have forgotten their important role in maintaining ultimate democratic control over this government.
[01:15:28.233 --> 01:15:43.157]  And as a result of that, one of the things, of course, that happened was the development over a long period of time, but finally culminating in 1913 with the Federal Reserve System, where once again an elite group gained control of one of the two basic powers of government.
[01:15:44.042 --> 01:15:50.243]  All political philosophy will tell you the two great powers of government are the power of the purse and the power of the sword.
[01:15:50.903 --> 01:16:02.946]  And they have gained control over the power of the purse through the Federal Reserve System, and the power of the sword in the hands of the people where it should be, according to the Second Amendment, has essentially atrophied.
[01:16:02.966 --> 01:16:12.988]  So now the people are looking to these homeland security agencies, whether they're local police or state police or federal agencies, and they are not seeing themselves
[01:16:14.079 --> 01:16:14.239]  That's
[01:16:38.948 --> 01:16:44.292]  Homeland Security problems of a very significant form and spread throughout the country.
[01:16:44.732 --> 01:16:53.998]  And at that point, the security responses or the responses to these problems should be coming from the people themselves.
[01:16:54.078 --> 01:17:05.065]  But what's happening is that the same group in control of the Federal Reserve System is dictating to us the method by which the problems which it has created
[01:17:06.155 --> 01:17:09.906]  Are going to be quote-unquote solved by it and its friends.
[01:17:10.207 --> 01:17:14.258]  And Doctor, Doctor, if I can just interject and get your take on this as you continue laying this out.
[01:17:16.314 --> 01:17:20.537]  They premeditatedly with problem, reaction, solution, and they state this, knew this.
[01:17:20.817 --> 01:17:24.339]  They know their system is going to cause this depression.
[01:17:24.699 --> 01:17:38.468]  They know it's going to cause civil unrest and rioting, and then the public will beg for troops and federalization on the streets, and then that will set the precedent they believe forever for the full final conversion to the tyranny.
[01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:44.152]  Well, I think there's no question that they understand the fragility of this system.
[01:17:45.581 --> 01:17:46.161]  I think it is.
[01:17:46.181 --> 01:17:46.541]  I think it is.
[01:18:09.796 --> 01:18:21.386]  If it politically and economically is getting out of their control in a real sense, now is the opportunity for the American people to step up and reassert their own control over this system.
[01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:24.509]  And speak to the microcosm of that.
[01:18:24.809 --> 01:18:29.293]  The police admit they have no right or duty to protect you.
[01:18:29.313 --> 01:18:30.855]  They have no liability to protect you.
[01:18:31.175 --> 01:18:32.897]  Then how dare Chicago and D.C.
[01:18:32.937 --> 01:18:35.238]  then say you have no right to protect yourself?
[01:18:35.258 --> 01:18:46.027]  This is a basic, God-given or organic logos, law of the universe, that any creature has a right to defend itself, even if some dictator says you don't have the right.
[01:18:46.287 --> 01:18:53.313]  And so we now have to say, look, we are going to defend ourselves whether you like it or not, because you can't and won't defend us.
[01:18:54.013 --> 01:18:55.334]  Well, I think that's exactly correct.
[01:18:55.394 --> 01:18:57.936]  And it's especially the can't aspect of this.
[01:18:58.617 --> 01:18:59.678]  Even if they wanted to,
[01:19:00.462 --> 01:19:08.214]  Even if you believe that those 20,000 troop deployments that they're thinking about, in their own minds, might be sufficient.
[01:19:08.555 --> 01:19:09.757]  We know that they can't be.
[01:19:10.586 --> 01:19:16.892]  Given the kind of social breakdown that may occur as a major economic crunch takes over.
[01:19:17.392 --> 01:19:20.214]  They simply don't have the manpower.
[01:19:20.595 --> 01:19:22.637]  They simply don't have the level of training.
[01:19:22.677 --> 01:19:30.403]  They simply don't have the ability to deploy people into all of the areas of this country where serious economic and social dislocations may take place.
[01:19:30.904 --> 01:19:34.527]  And then what are they going to do about essentially economic reconstruction?
[01:19:35.555 --> 01:19:35.995]  Troops!
[01:19:36.115 --> 01:19:37.416]  I don't care how many you have.
[01:19:37.436 --> 01:19:40.837]  Troops are not the appropriate method for dealing with that problem.
[01:19:40.857 --> 01:19:52.161]  That has to be dealt with by local people themselves reconstructing their own economies, using alternative currencies when Federal Reserve notes are no longer acceptable internationally and probably domestically as well.
[01:19:53.282 --> 01:19:56.123]  Dealing with their own questions of local police.
[01:19:56.483 --> 01:20:01.865]  And if we the people ourselves in our own localities don't take that system, that situation in hand,
[01:20:02.725 --> 01:20:04.646]  Things are going to get out of hand very quickly.
[01:20:04.686 --> 01:20:06.407]  They can't be controlled from the top down.
[01:20:06.727 --> 01:20:07.887]  Dr. Vieira, stay there.
[01:20:07.907 --> 01:20:14.990]  When we come back, we'll get out your websites and talk about some of your books and materials, but talk about solutions, what we're going into and where you see things going.

[01:20:17.491 --> 01:20:18.592]  The headlines are clear.
[01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:21.757]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:20:22.238 --> 01:20:24.760]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:20:25.441 --> 01:20:27.102]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:20:27.182 --> 01:20:30.365]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:20:30.505 --> 01:20:34.148]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope to stay free.

[01:22:16.758 --> 01:22:23.162]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.503]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:22:26.184 --> 01:22:27.204]  But who is the enemy?
[01:22:27.725 --> 01:22:28.225]  Bin Laden.
[01:22:28.525 --> 01:22:29.446]  This is his M.O.s.
[01:22:29.466 --> 01:22:30.887]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:22:30.907 --> 01:22:32.548]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:22:32.888 --> 01:22:39.632]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:22:40.032 --> 01:22:40.472]  Some U.S.
[01:22:40.512 --> 01:22:46.196]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:22:46.856 --> 01:22:50.379]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.162]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:23:17.267 --> 01:23:21.029]  Do you have aches and pains or suffer from indigestion or inflammation?
[01:23:21.349 --> 01:23:23.711]  Are you tired of feeling restless from insomnia?
[01:23:24.051 --> 01:23:31.095]  These symptoms are produced by negative toxins, but with the correct information, understanding, and care, you can cleanse them from your body.
[01:23:31.395 --> 01:23:36.438]  Allomaster.com would like to help you begin the road to recovery with aloe vera.

[01:24:25.111 --> 01:24:28.773]  All right, let's go right back to our guest, Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[01:24:29.614 --> 01:24:30.875]  Sir, what are the best websites?
[01:24:30.915 --> 01:24:32.336]  I know you write for NewsWithViews.com.
[01:24:32.356 --> 01:24:35.778]  I know you have some of your own sites, some of the publisher's sites.
[01:24:35.818 --> 01:24:39.840]  Where should people go to visit to find out more about your important work?
[01:24:40.981 --> 01:24:49.166]  Well, one that we're working on now is called CommitteesOfSafety.com, which is actually a group that's centered in Connecticut.
[01:24:49.955 --> 01:24:56.181]  And trying to develop a template for what I call the revitalization of the constitutional militia of the several states.
[01:24:56.241 --> 01:25:01.886]  Isn't that the ancient name of the groups that would manage the militias?
[01:25:02.486 --> 01:25:02.887]  You got it.
[01:25:02.907 --> 01:25:04.989]  I think that's why it was chosen.
[01:25:06.090 --> 01:25:09.533]  Because what we need to do is to go back and get citizens organized.
[01:25:10.502 --> 01:25:12.103]  Let's speak to that before you leave.
[01:25:12.123 --> 01:25:12.744]  This is a short segment.
[01:25:12.844 --> 01:25:13.764]  We've got the rest of the hour.
[01:25:25.692 --> 01:25:33.678]  The ancestral, almost, memories, if you want to call it that, or our instincts as Americans, were you heartened by seeing all-time record gun sales when Obama was elected?
[01:25:34.238 --> 01:25:36.420]  As you know, for the audience, he is for gun bans.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.942]  He says that's reasonable, and his lawyers speak.
[01:25:39.202 --> 01:25:47.428]  I mean, is that not a good sign that the people fundamentally, and even a lot of liberals I know are now buying guns, realize... Sure.
[01:25:47.488 --> 01:25:48.429]  In two ways, Alex.
[01:25:48.469 --> 01:25:50.911]  Number one, it shows a fundamental distrust
[01:25:52.134 --> 01:25:52.595]  I don't know.
[01:26:12.665 --> 01:26:13.705]  That's a very short answer.
[01:26:13.745 --> 01:26:29.970]  We have to provide our own homeland security, our own security of a free state, because if we don't, even our local police, and let's assume that we can, you know, trust those folks that they're acting in good faith, they are simply not capable, institutionally, of providing this level of security that we're going to need.
[01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:32.291]  If we don't do it, we're not going to have it.
[01:26:33.376 --> 01:26:41.227]  Well, also the modern police configuration is not the swashbuckling real tough guys that were locally controlled we had in the past that could deal with things.
[01:26:42.228 --> 01:26:47.915]  It is a classic, you know, cover their butt in their little armored citadels whenever a real crisis happens.
[01:26:48.376 --> 01:26:49.738]  Well, that's another one of the problems.
[01:26:49.918 --> 01:26:53.082]  I think institutionally they have other difficulties on top of this.
[01:26:53.102 --> 01:27:00.852]  But even if you assumed this earlier model, it still wouldn't function given the level of problems that we're going to be facing.
[01:27:01.272 --> 01:27:04.737]  So we have to come back once again to the realization that self-government
[01:27:05.197 --> 01:27:06.339]  We're good to go.
[01:27:19.668 --> 01:27:22.849]  Because he says the same thing as the Second Amendment, somewhat different language.
[01:27:22.869 --> 01:27:24.149]  Mao Zedong, what did he say?
[01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:26.669]  Political power goes out of the barrel of a gun!
[01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.570]  Yes.
[01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:27.950]  Right?
[01:27:27.970 --> 01:27:36.752]  The people who have that ultimate military power are the ones who are going to determine the political structure and operations of their society.
[01:27:37.132 --> 01:27:43.673]  And if it isn't the people themselves, we the people, who control that power, as the Second Amendment says we should and must,
[01:27:44.213 --> 01:27:49.114]  Then that governing power will fall into the hands of someone else and we will not like the result.
[01:27:49.395 --> 01:27:53.456]  It is immediately forfeited to the tyrant, always in history.
[01:27:53.756 --> 01:28:05.439]  The outcome is always the same and that's why I hope the listeners out there realize this and spread the word because if we're not involved politically and don't demand our sovereign rights, then that vacuum will be filled with the parasites.
[01:28:06.227 --> 01:28:07.129]  That's exactly right.
[01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:15.881]  If you don't demand your rights by actually exercising them, it's not simply a matter of going to legislators and saying, oh, please do this or please do that.
[01:28:16.341 --> 01:28:19.726]  A well-regulated militia requires your participation.
[01:28:20.385 --> 01:28:23.647]  And if you won't do that, then your rights are simply going to go away, one way or the other.
[01:28:23.667 --> 01:28:33.772]  And on the other side of the coin, we see the tyrants exercising unconstitutional classic despotism to set the precedent and acclimate the public.
[01:28:33.792 --> 01:28:35.433]  So they are practicing looting.
[01:28:35.453 --> 01:28:36.674]  They are practicing tyranny.
[01:28:36.874 --> 01:28:40.776]  They are practicing warrantless wiretaps against the American people and then flaunting it.
[01:28:40.796 --> 01:28:41.556]  That's right.
[01:28:41.576 --> 01:28:43.337]  We don't have to encourage them in that activity.
[01:28:43.357 --> 01:28:44.678]  They'll do that spontaneously.
[01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:59.198]  We have to get ourselves out of those chairs, out of those sofas, turn off those televisions, and get active in the political realm of self-government in order to have the kind of homeland security that we need, which the Constitution tells us is the only one worth having.
[01:28:59.418 --> 01:29:01.319]  The security of a free state!
[01:29:01.599 --> 01:29:04.881]  What's the point of having homeland security in a police state?
[01:29:06.482 --> 01:29:07.343]  Is that security?
[01:29:07.363 --> 01:29:09.464]  Of course it's the exact opposite of security!
[01:29:10.569 --> 01:29:12.932]  Sir, you've had a lot of foresight with your predictions.
[01:29:12.952 --> 01:29:18.157]  We're going to break here in a moment, but come back in a long 15-minute segment, or longer.
[01:29:18.277 --> 01:29:31.231]  I would like you to break down how you believe this will unfold versus how you wish it would unfold, or different avenues, different ideas of where you see this going, and solutions.
[01:29:31.872 --> 01:29:35.616]  Well, I'm going to be putting up some more material on my www.edwinviera.com, which is really just a holding place right now.
[01:29:53.135 --> 01:29:58.740]  Um, and so as these things come out, probably I'll be announcing them in columns on News Reviews, and we'll get the word out as I'm developing it.
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:29:59.841]  Alright, stay there.
[01:30:00.221 --> 01:30:05.486]  Ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake, this is the greatest threat our Republic and the world has ever faced.
[01:30:07.448 --> 01:30:08.349]  We're on the march.
[01:30:08.849 --> 01:30:10.451]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:11.371 --> 01:30:14.074]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:17.501 --> 01:30:25.127]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[01:30:25.568 --> 01:30:26.729]  You need the Paclite!
[01:30:27.169 --> 01:30:35.035]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[01:30:35.416 --> 01:30:38.558]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[01:30:38.958 --> 01:30:43.402]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[01:30:43.802 --> 01:30:45.964]  The Paclite is so durable, soldiers overseas
[01:30:45.984 --> 01:30:46.204]  I think so.
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:22.505]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:31:22.766 --> 01:31:24.067]  And we knew what to do.
[01:31:24.087 --> 01:31:25.909]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:31:26.089 --> 01:31:32.515]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:31:33.116 --> 01:31:41.644]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:31:42.028 --> 01:31:48.831]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:31:49.132 --> 01:31:52.173]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:31:52.273 --> 01:31:57.496]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:31:58.056 --> 01:32:00.697]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:32:01.138 --> 01:32:07.921]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:32:11.118 --> 01:32:12.578]  We are under the microscope.
[01:32:12.618 --> 01:32:17.739]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[01:32:17.839 --> 01:32:20.620]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.

[01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:36.324]  We are going into this system.
[01:33:37.565 --> 01:33:42.691]  Whether you like it or not, we have global conquerors.
[01:33:42.792 --> 01:33:44.033]  That's what world government is.
[01:33:44.474 --> 01:33:46.816]  Run by private financial institutions.
[01:33:46.856 --> 01:33:48.919]  The same ones our founding fathers fought.
[01:33:48.959 --> 01:33:51.562]  The same people President Andrew Jackson fought.
[01:33:51.582 --> 01:33:52.783]  The same people Lincoln fought.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:55.041]  The same deal.
[01:33:55.321 --> 01:33:57.904]  Dr. Edwin Vieira is our guest.
[01:33:57.944 --> 01:33:59.145]  I covered his bio at the first.
[01:33:59.805 --> 01:34:00.946]  Just an amazing individual.
[01:34:00.986 --> 01:34:02.407]  Has been at the Supreme Court four times.
[01:34:02.427 --> 01:34:03.909]  Won three of the four.
[01:34:04.429 --> 01:34:07.031]  A great constitutional scholar and author, lecturer.
[01:34:07.492 --> 01:34:11.035]  Okay, we've got about 27 minutes left with you, sir, and I've thrown out all my points.
[01:34:12.076 --> 01:34:19.202]  Just key areas of where you see this going, how we counter it, how we fight it, how you see it unfolding, and what the people need to do.
[01:34:19.802 --> 01:34:20.763]  And if you want to
[01:34:22.964 --> 01:34:30.406]  Well, let's start at the end.
[01:34:30.506 --> 01:34:44.570]  If we don't take some appropriate action, we are going to see first the imposition of a financial police state in this country, because that's the only way they're going to be able to bring control out of the chaos that the breakdown of the Federal Reserve System is causing, and maintain their own power.
[01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:45.430]  I mean, that's obvious.
[01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:46.151]  That's the key.
[01:34:46.191 --> 01:34:47.491]  They need to maintain their own power.
[01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:54.144]  And then that may morph, if you will, into some kind of regional governmental structure.
[01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:58.691]  Which will be the rationalization for creating a new regional currency.
[01:34:58.731 --> 01:35:04.312]  They floated names like the Amaro, or if you want to go to a higher level, the Phoenix was floated a few years ago.
[01:35:04.332 --> 01:35:15.734]  And obviously that will be, if you follow the historical trends in this, that will be the method that they'll attempt to use to expand and maintain their control over the monetary system.
[01:35:15.974 --> 01:35:17.495]  Alright, so that's their plan in a sense.
[01:35:17.535 --> 01:35:18.315]  I'll leave that aside.
[01:35:18.335 --> 01:35:21.236]  They're going to do what they're going to do.
[01:35:21.316 --> 01:35:23.056]  We have to respond to this.
[01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:24.931]  In our own way.
[01:35:25.512 --> 01:35:34.456]  Our immediate problem is, of course, the breakdown of the monetary system, because that's where the great wave, almost a tsunami of economic and social chaos is going to develop.
[01:35:35.156 --> 01:35:45.841]  Now, it certainly would be possible if we could, in Congress, in principle, pass some of the legislation that Ron Paul has proposed for ending the Federal Reserve System.
[01:35:46.241 --> 01:35:51.123]  Very, very unlikely, obviously, with the Obama administration and a Democratic Congress.
[01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:56.936]  It's certainly possible to be able to do something like that on a smaller scale at a state level.
[01:35:56.956 --> 01:36:01.241]  I have, in fact, drafted a bill originally from New Hampshire.
[01:36:01.261 --> 01:36:09.851]  It's on a website called goldmoneybill.org, and it can be applied with a little bit of appropriate tweaking to almost any other state.
[01:36:10.589 --> 01:36:11.090]  We're good to go.
[01:36:23.241 --> 01:36:28.403]  As far as I know now, there are three or four states where there are some legislators who are actively considering that.
[01:36:28.804 --> 01:36:33.546]  And there are some cities that have their own paper script now popping up in neighborhoods.
[01:36:33.606 --> 01:36:35.687]  We could see that happen as well.
[01:36:36.467 --> 01:36:40.889]  So there are a number of possibilities there as people begin to think about the use of alternative currencies.
[01:36:41.882 --> 01:36:52.610]  The thing that worries me a little bit is that we don't have a sufficient basis in public education so that the large percentage of the population simply doesn't have any idea about this alternative.
[01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:55.112]  They don't seem to understand even that it's really necessary.
[01:36:55.652 --> 01:37:00.055]  They'll kind of hold on to the Federal Reserve System until the whole house of cards crashes down on their heads.
[01:37:00.495 --> 01:37:02.957]  So we need public education, number one, in that area.
[01:37:02.977 --> 01:37:03.738]  And then number two,
[01:37:04.685 --> 01:37:12.539]  We really do have to be prepared for the possibility, if it's not the likelihood, that this monetary system will in fact come down in the short term.
[01:37:12.559 --> 01:37:16.106]  And if you're looking at the prognostications, I hate to make prognostications.
[01:37:17.012 --> 01:37:31.800]  But I would say, my gosh, 18 months to two years at the outside before we see some massive inflationary events and perhaps a large segment of the world bailing out of the Federal Reserve System, refusing to accept the Federal Reserve currency as it were.
[01:37:31.841 --> 01:37:36.043]  Well, even the economist is coming out and saying we're in a depression already.
[01:37:36.638 --> 01:37:41.000]  Well, there's the depression and then hyperinflation on top of that, so you have the worst of all possible worlds.
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:41.300]  Hyperinflation.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:47.222]  You have a breakdown of the currency simultaneously, and that leads to social dislocation on a mass scale.
[01:37:47.242 --> 01:38:01.147]  So assuming that that's coming, and assuming that we can't move in the direction of an alternative currency fast enough to mitigate that or prevent that kind of a collapse, well, what's the next step that we need to be prepared for?
[01:38:01.427 --> 01:38:02.948]  Well, that's providing the security
[01:38:03.837 --> 01:38:10.222]  Of a free state that is going to be necessary to overcome these dislocations, especially at the local and state level.
[01:38:10.863 --> 01:38:32.260]  And that's why for several years now, tied into this prediction, I think not much of a prediction, it's obvious, that the monetary system is coming down, is the necessity for people to organize themselves at the state level to cause the state legislatures to pass the appropriate statutes to revitalize their state militia, because under the Constitution,
[01:38:32.961 --> 01:38:36.802]  The militia are described as the militia of the several states.
[01:38:37.442 --> 01:38:40.243]  This is a state institution in each state.
[01:38:40.563 --> 01:38:43.124]  We're talking about a basic concept of federalism here.
[01:38:43.524 --> 01:38:46.025]  We're not top-down, but bottom-up organization.
[01:38:46.405 --> 01:38:52.366]  Doctor, I want you to go into that in detail, but let me just add a little caveat to get your take on it because it's so important.
[01:38:52.886 --> 01:38:54.527]  As you know, but the listeners may not,
[01:38:55.347 --> 01:39:04.612]  Homeland Security has announced, NORTHCOM has announced, Secretary of Defense Gates has announced what we saw them setting up quietly decades ago and coming to a head now in 2008-2009.
[01:39:05.033 --> 01:39:17.080]  They are absorbing the National Guard from the Governor's control as a full federal force and it says the Governors will quote, serve at federal pleasure as dual-headed commanders.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.600]  Under federal control.
[01:39:18.641 --> 01:39:33.087]  So you're saying go back to true localism, which can provide the real security, but instead they're trying to evolve in the opposite direction towards the crossing the Rubicon classic imperial national police force.
[01:39:33.527 --> 01:39:40.892]  Oh, exactly, and what this proves is that the National Guard, and of course I'm not against the National Guard in principle, but the National Guard is not the constitutional militia.
[01:39:41.372 --> 01:39:57.963]  If it were the constitutional militia, not only would all of the officers be appointed solely by the states, but there would be no way that this instrument could be federalized, as it were, except for three very specific federal purposes, executing the law, suppressing insurrections, and repelling
[01:39:58.450 --> 01:39:59.591]  We're good to go.
[01:40:15.486 --> 01:40:17.107]  A militia structure is still in existence.
[01:40:17.167 --> 01:40:18.068]  New York may be one.
[01:40:18.568 --> 01:40:20.069]  They call it the New York State Guard.
[01:40:20.089 --> 01:40:21.610]  I think Texas has something similar.
[01:40:22.231 --> 01:40:22.971]  Alabama?
[01:40:23.672 --> 01:40:24.092]  Alabama.
[01:40:24.112 --> 01:40:25.233]  But they're a very small number.
[01:40:25.453 --> 01:40:26.173]  A very small number.
[01:40:26.193 --> 01:40:28.815]  I think in New York it's 60,000 members.
[01:40:29.515 --> 01:40:36.900]  And it's supposed to be, constitutionally, every able-bodied man and now today, potentially every able-bodied woman would have some.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:42.564]  And as you know, now Homeland Security has been coming in and recruiting and using them and directing the State Guards.
[01:40:43.044 --> 01:40:43.485]  Oh, that's right.
[01:40:43.505 --> 01:40:51.252]  So we have another problem there because of this constant emphasis on top-down, centralized control coming out of Washington, D.C.
[01:40:51.292 --> 01:40:52.473]  So we have to reverse that.
[01:40:52.893 --> 01:40:54.395]  We have to reverse it for a number of reasons.
[01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:58.118]  First, because that's not the mechanism that's going to provide us with a free state.
[01:40:58.559 --> 01:41:03.423]  But secondly, it's not the mechanism that's workable if we have a major economic breakdown.
[01:41:03.564 --> 01:41:04.925]  Evidence by Katrina.
[01:41:06.066 --> 01:41:06.446]  That's right.
[01:41:06.506 --> 01:41:09.447]  Evidence by Katrina, which was a predicted breakdown.
[01:41:09.548 --> 01:41:12.269]  They knew what was coming, and they weren't capable of dealing with it.
[01:41:12.609 --> 01:41:27.558]  If we're talking about an economic breakdown as the result of a collapse of the whole monetary and banking system, nobody can predict how far that will go, how difficult it will be to set up alternative economic structures in the localities, what kind of resources will be available.
[01:41:27.818 --> 01:41:29.239]  That certainly cannot be done by
[01:41:29.939 --> 01:41:38.544]  Even if you assume that the Homeland Security operation was run by people of eminent goodwill, as Madison said, if your government were run by angels, right?
[01:41:38.864 --> 01:41:46.068]  It still could not perform the function necessary simply because it doesn't have the manpower, doesn't have the information, doesn't have access to the people.
[01:41:46.088 --> 01:41:49.089]  And even if they were logistical masters, they couldn't do it?
[01:41:49.290 --> 01:41:50.390]  No, they couldn't possibly do it.
[01:41:50.410 --> 01:41:56.253]  We're talking about what used to be called the problem of rational economic calculation in terms of socialistic central management.
[01:41:56.293 --> 01:41:57.514]  That's the problem they would be facing.
[01:41:58.207 --> 01:42:00.029]  So we have to go in this opposite direction.
[01:42:00.069 --> 01:42:05.154]  The Constitution has been telling us this since 1787 and 1791.
[01:42:05.534 --> 01:42:06.856]  Apparently we haven't learned the lesson.
[01:42:06.896 --> 01:42:07.897]  Now we're facing the problem.
[01:42:07.917 --> 01:42:11.220]  So what I've been proposing to people, and I have a book out, it's called Constitution.
[01:42:12.876 --> 01:42:14.178]  You can go and find it on Amazon.
[01:42:14.218 --> 01:42:19.063]  Oh, and by the way, Alex, if people go there, don't worry if it says there's only one or two copies.
[01:42:19.084 --> 01:42:21.206]  That's some kind of glitch in the way they run that system.
[01:42:21.286 --> 01:42:21.807]  Stop there!
[01:42:21.907 --> 01:42:22.307]  Stop there!
[01:42:22.327 --> 01:42:23.969]  Your phone cut out.
[01:42:23.989 --> 01:42:26.733]  Dr. Vieira, your phone cut out when you plugged the name of the book.
[01:42:27.473 --> 01:42:29.296]  Constitutional Homeland Security.
[01:42:30.031 --> 01:42:31.431]  Constitutional Homeland Security.
[01:42:31.451 --> 01:42:32.432]  That's the important word.
[01:42:32.492 --> 01:42:34.752]  CONSTITUTIONAL Homeland Security.
[01:42:34.792 --> 01:42:37.013]  Not the kind of Homeland Security they're giving us from Washington.
[01:42:37.213 --> 01:42:40.474]  By the way, I have read some of that.
[01:42:40.614 --> 01:42:42.015]  I haven't had a chance to read the whole book.
[01:42:42.195 --> 01:42:45.696]  I need to carry that on our online bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:45.916 --> 01:42:46.716]  I need to contact you.
[01:42:46.916 --> 01:42:52.538]  We're always looking for the best creme de la creme material to carry at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:52.558 --> 01:42:53.218]  But please continue.
[01:42:53.772 --> 01:43:01.797]  Okay, we can certainly do that, but in any event, the purpose of the book is to... I wouldn't call it a solution, necessarily, because it's experimental in a sense.
[01:43:02.257 --> 01:43:10.282]  It's to provide a direction, and the program is for people to begin organizing local advocacy groups.
[01:43:10.582 --> 01:43:17.226]  I call them Citizens Homeland Security Associations, the fellows in Connecticut call it the Committees of Safety, whatever word you want to use.
[01:43:17.746 --> 01:43:20.648]  These are not, quote, militia groups, unquote.
[01:43:21.238 --> 01:43:43.500]  They are First Amendment advocacy groups, the purpose of which is to educate the local community, come up with basically ideas of what needs to be done in your own locality, in your own state, the specific problems of Homeland Security that have to be addressed, develop a statutory plan, and I suppose at some stage, in fact right now I'm drafting a statute for Virginia,
[01:43:44.153 --> 01:43:47.015]  People such as myself would become involved in the drafting of statutes.
[01:43:47.795 --> 01:43:52.298]  Interact with those state legislators who have some insight and vision in this area.
[01:43:52.758 --> 01:43:56.160]  They get the legislation introduced and then enacted.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:59.442]  And the big selling point of this kind of organization is twofold.
[01:43:59.482 --> 01:44:04.405]  Number one, once you have people organized this way, you can put a great deal of pressure on the state legislature.
[01:44:05.065 --> 01:44:12.289]  Because you're talking about potentially several thousand people who are out there affirmatively asking for this kind of legislation.
[01:44:12.329 --> 01:44:13.050]  And then number two,
[01:44:14.392 --> 01:44:30.582]  To make the legislation work will require initially a fairly large contingent of volunteers to step into the breach, as it were, because most people out there will need a fair amount of education before they're ready to take on the duties of a proper constitutional militia.
[01:44:30.602 --> 01:44:32.863]  So we're going to have to depend upon volunteers.
[01:44:33.464 --> 01:44:37.206]  And once a large segment of the population has been organized this way,
[01:44:37.856 --> 01:44:39.897]  There's the ultimate selling point to the legislator.
[01:44:39.917 --> 01:44:41.398]  You put this in, you get this passed.
[01:44:41.738 --> 01:44:42.878]  It's not pie in the sky.
[01:44:43.159 --> 01:44:50.142]  We have 5,000 people in the state of Virginia ready to take on some of these responsibilities and show that this can be done.
[01:44:50.502 --> 01:44:54.444]  And once that experiment has been conducted successfully, and I believe it can be,
[01:44:55.237 --> 01:45:08.166]  Then thousands and thousands of others are going to want to come into this process, because as the crisis develops and they see that the serious consequences are impinging on their lives, what will their alternative be, Alex?
[01:45:09.207 --> 01:45:12.589]  They'll either do this, or they'll be at the mercy of God knows what!
[01:45:12.609 --> 01:45:14.310]  Alright, let me stop you there.
[01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:17.533]  I've got two points that are questions for you.
[01:45:17.573 --> 01:45:19.114]  Let me just make the statement.
[01:45:19.134 --> 01:45:20.575]  You can start at the front or the end or the middle.
[01:45:21.641 --> 01:45:44.017]  I'm not for concealed carry in Texas and Florida, but that's kind of the system, its way of training us to turn a right into a privilege, but it can also be seen in its working model as 25 on average percent crime reductions within two years in states, those are federal numbers as you know, but for the audience, where it's implemented.
[01:45:44.077 --> 01:45:49.822]  So there's a model where that is at least in the right direction towards a militia,
[01:45:50.402 --> 01:46:03.772]  Where even this gun-grabbing system that wants a monopoly of power has been forced through the will to at least try to remove some prohibition on people who are armed out in the public.
[01:46:04.053 --> 01:46:10.718]  So that's a basis already in the true militia and going back towards the roots.
[01:46:10.758 --> 01:46:11.558]  Now that's one point.
[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:19.524]  Then separately back to what you're saying about creating this idea, this alternative, having the legislation there.
[01:46:20.757 --> 01:46:27.525]  I had the idea right after the Patriot Act passed, and I wrote an analysis of it, and people picked up on it and wrote it up, and 800 plus cities passed it, seven states.
[01:46:28.085 --> 01:46:34.913]  The last time I checked was throwing out the Patriot Act in counties and cities, and then the feds said, well, we're the feds, you can't do that.
[01:46:34.953 --> 01:46:36.555]  That was decided after the Civil War.
[01:46:36.575 --> 01:46:37.476]  And we said, it doesn't matter.
[01:46:37.917 --> 01:46:41.160]  This is, again, moving back towards Tenth Amendment, regardless of what you say.
[01:46:41.921 --> 01:46:59.273]  And we are declaring that locally, the sense of the city councils, the county commissions, the local governments, the parishes, the states, that we rebuke what you're doing, and we're going to order our police and others not to follow unconstitutional orders, and look at how successful that was.
[01:46:59.553 --> 01:47:08.460]  So again, more evidence of what you're saying truly codified back into law, with its constitutional precedent, how powerful that could be.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.061]  So those two points.
[01:47:10.581 --> 01:47:11.664]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:47:11.684 --> 01:47:12.846]  Let's take those in reverse order.
[01:47:13.307 --> 01:47:14.109]  Remember that
[01:47:15.413 --> 01:47:19.295]  The militia of the several states are constitutional institutions.
[01:47:19.335 --> 01:47:21.696]  The Constitution recognizes these things.
[01:47:22.116 --> 01:47:27.479]  So there is no superiority of the federal government over the militia of the several states.
[01:47:27.559 --> 01:47:28.439]  Quite the opposite.
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.142]  The Tenth Amendment also and the Second Amendment quite obviously reinforce that.
[01:47:33.522 --> 01:47:41.406]  But right in the body of the Constitution itself, these institutions are recognized as pre-existing the Constitution and as being intended to
[01:47:42.606 --> 01:47:44.266]  Continue in existence thereafter.
[01:47:44.807 --> 01:48:06.232]  Secondly, your point about the concealed carry licenses, I would say as well, and I agree with you, that the concealed carry license, the only one you need is the Second Amendment, but we do have these provisions that have been put in, and as a result of them, a lot of people who would not in the past have been able to use a firearm to protect themselves have been enabled by this legislation.
[01:48:06.512 --> 01:48:10.013]  What I do in one of the draft bills that I'm working on is build on that and say, alright,
[01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:32.880]  Those people who come into the malicious structures with concealed carry permits, the ones who have already been gone through the vetting and the FBI check and all the rest of it, so we know that they're not criminals or whatever, those people will be given further authority as some kind of deputy sheriff or deputy police or what have you, depending on the jurisdiction, so that they will now participate directly
[01:48:33.812 --> 01:48:37.455]  In crime control, crime deterrence, crime prevention, crime apprehension.
[01:48:37.775 --> 01:48:46.943]  So all of a sudden now, instead of having, you know, 50 police in Warren County where I live, or 60 sheriff's deputies, it all of a sudden becomes 2,000 of them.
[01:48:48.064 --> 01:48:59.453]  And now we begin to expand not simply the concept that you have a right of self-protection, have a firearm for self-protection, but you can expand that right to participation in actual execution of the laws.
[01:48:59.693 --> 01:49:00.774]  And the posse is reborn.
[01:49:00.814 --> 01:49:02.595]  Let me bring up two sub-points there.
[01:49:03.476 --> 01:49:15.843]  We have the demonization, though, of this ancient basic right, you know, going back to the Dutch or the Swiss or, you know, back to other nations before that, of the local people in the village, you know, protecting their community.
[01:49:16.563 --> 01:49:21.166]  We have this federal demonization of the idea of malicious or armed citizens.
[01:49:21.206 --> 01:49:24.748]  The monopoly of power can only be to the overarching federal super-state.
[01:49:25.048 --> 01:49:27.830]  That's A. How do you deal with the fact that they've tried to create
[01:49:28.530 --> 01:49:45.417]  a taboo idea like it's pornography or something and then a subset they know this natural instinct uh... for self-defense and individual control so the feds are creating the false militia under homeland security in this million man domestic security force federally directed with an anti-american agenda
[01:49:46.385 --> 01:49:49.026]  Well, number one, I don't think that that is going to be successful.
[01:49:49.126 --> 01:49:56.148]  They're not going to be able to put that thing together, or to the extent they put something together, it's not going to be proved to be terribly functional.
[01:49:56.608 --> 01:50:05.011]  In terms of the demonization, I always ask somebody who looks sideways when I mention the word militia, I say, well, what other provisions of the Constitution do you disagree with?
[01:50:05.671 --> 01:50:05.892]  Yes.
[01:50:06.032 --> 01:50:08.612]  You know, I don't agree with the word militia as necessarily the free state.
[01:50:08.792 --> 01:50:10.133]  What kind of state do you want to live in?
[01:50:11.121 --> 01:50:12.642]  You know, you want to live in an unfree state?
[01:50:12.662 --> 01:50:15.585]  The Constitution has taught... This is a statement of constitutional law!
[01:50:15.845 --> 01:50:18.027]  This isn't some kind of hortatory pronouncement!
[01:50:18.047 --> 01:50:20.650]  This isn't some kind of an opinion of James Madison!
[01:50:21.511 --> 01:50:23.432]  I take most of his opinions to be more or less correct.
[01:50:23.652 --> 01:50:25.414]  This is the great canon!
[01:50:25.814 --> 01:50:26.775]  This is the great canon!
[01:50:26.815 --> 01:50:28.056]  This is the great law!
[01:50:28.097 --> 01:50:29.318]  This is part of the Great Red!
[01:50:29.878 --> 01:50:30.238]  That's right!
[01:50:30.738 --> 01:50:36.421]  It's part of the structure of our fundamental law, and it makes a declaration that I think is pretty emphatic.
[01:50:36.721 --> 01:50:40.203]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[01:50:40.223 --> 01:50:41.343]  Just stop right there!
[01:50:41.884 --> 01:50:48.567]  If you don't have this structure, the Constitution itself is telling you, you, in the long run, are not going to live in a free state.
[01:50:49.047 --> 01:50:50.428]  Well, what kind of state do you want to live in?
[01:50:50.848 --> 01:50:51.848]  And the right of the people!
[01:50:51.948 --> 01:50:52.509]  The people!
[01:50:52.829 --> 01:50:53.609]  The people!
[01:50:53.849 --> 01:50:54.650]  And who are they?
[01:50:56.338 --> 01:50:58.400]  We the people!
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:01.101]  The people are us.
[01:51:01.501 --> 01:51:02.822]  We are the people.
[01:51:03.082 --> 01:51:05.584]  And if we don't have a right to be armed, we are slaves.
[01:51:05.744 --> 01:51:06.924]  Only slaves are disarmed.
[01:51:07.204 --> 01:51:09.686]  First gun laws against blacks, Native Americans.
[01:51:10.066 --> 01:51:11.367]  Slaves are disarmed in Rome.
[01:51:11.847 --> 01:51:13.168]  Slaves are disarmed in China.
[01:51:13.448 --> 01:51:14.008]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:14.068 --> 01:51:16.149]  Final segment with Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[01:51:18.851 --> 01:51:21.032]  With rising unemployment and an economy
[01:51:26.049 --> 01:51:26.890]  I think so.
[01:51:47.324 --> 01:51:47.804]  We're good to go.
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:23.222]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:52:23.582 --> 01:52:25.563]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:52:26.243 --> 01:52:27.264]  But who is the enemy?
[01:52:27.784 --> 01:52:28.304]  Bin Laden.
[01:52:28.584 --> 01:52:29.504]  This is his ammo.
[01:52:29.524 --> 01:52:30.945]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:52:30.965 --> 01:52:32.645]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:52:32.945 --> 01:52:39.708]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:52:40.088 --> 01:52:40.548]  Some U.S.
[01:52:40.588 --> 01:52:46.210]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:50.411]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:52:50.431 --> 01:52:53.492]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:53:17.506 --> 01:53:29.207]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.
[01:53:31.903 --> 01:53:33.044]  We're good to go!
[01:54:03.370 --> 01:54:04.551]  Final segment with Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:36.563]  Google his name, find out more, read his stuff at newsreviews.com.
[01:54:36.623 --> 01:54:37.404]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:54:39.786 --> 01:54:43.991]  My website's InfoWars.com and of course PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:46.124 --> 01:54:47.625]  This is the great contest.
[01:54:48.305 --> 01:54:52.947]  We've had tyranny breeding through the central bank in this nation for more than 90 years.
[01:54:53.828 --> 01:55:04.873]  Now they're attempting to fully overthrow the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, our basic common law, the greatest ever developed by man in our history.
[01:55:06.215 --> 01:55:08.776]  You are defenders of the Republic.
[01:55:09.777 --> 01:55:10.557]  Stand with us.
[01:55:10.597 --> 01:55:11.438]  Become informed.
[01:55:12.318 --> 01:55:13.759]  Don't look for orders from headquarters.
[01:55:14.579 --> 01:55:16.040]  Get out there and take action.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:19.241]  Or be usurped and enslaved.
[01:55:20.462 --> 01:55:21.883]  The choice is yours.
[01:55:24.349 --> 01:55:27.612]  Dr. Vieira, we've got about four minutes left.
[01:55:28.093 --> 01:55:29.013]  You've got the floor.
[01:55:29.454 --> 01:55:33.898]  Any closing comments or points that you need to relay to the millions of viewers and listeners?
[01:55:34.318 --> 01:55:40.064]  Well, I'm glad you said don't take orders from headquarters, because the opposite of that is, of course, we are the headquarters.
[01:55:40.905 --> 01:55:43.667]  We the people, three most important words in the Constitution.
[01:55:44.488 --> 01:55:49.533]  If we don't exercise self-governmental authority, then essentially everything is lost.
[01:55:50.197 --> 01:56:01.307]  And the only thing I would suggest to people, because I'm trying to get out, as I say, this message on revitalizing what I consider to be one of, if not the most important pillars of our constitutional structure, the militia of the several states.
[01:56:02.007 --> 01:56:04.990]  Take a look at that book, Constitutional Homeland Security, as I say, it's on
[01:56:05.729 --> 01:56:10.010]  Amazon, and I hope Alex will end up being on one of your websites as well.
[01:56:10.290 --> 01:56:12.271]  And you're quarterbacking this.
[01:56:12.371 --> 01:56:13.331]  You're a great scholar.
[01:56:13.351 --> 01:56:14.812]  You've won three times the Supreme Court.
[01:56:16.492 --> 01:56:19.733]  This is a great salvo in the info war, in the fight for liberty.
[01:56:20.033 --> 01:56:21.534]  People need to carry the ball.
[01:56:22.254 --> 01:56:22.794]  Well, that's right.
[01:56:22.814 --> 01:56:23.835]  First, they need to get informed.
[01:56:24.015 --> 01:56:31.517]  Take a look at the book, take a look at my columns on news reviews, where I go into this in some detail, tying it into the banking and monetary system.
[01:56:32.357 --> 01:56:33.918]  Become informed about these issues.
[01:56:34.638 --> 01:56:38.179]  Decide for yourself whether this isn't something that's vitally important to be done.
[01:56:38.759 --> 01:56:50.923]  If you agree with me that it is, get a copy of the book, sit down with some of your neighbors over coffee, and begin discussing how you're going to implement a local plan to get those state legislators off the ball and moving in the right direction.
[01:56:51.423 --> 01:56:52.224]  Because that's the key.
[01:56:52.284 --> 01:56:55.605]  Get control over that local political structure.
[01:56:55.805 --> 01:56:58.747]  We can't control the federal government in Washington, D.C.
[01:56:58.767 --> 01:56:59.527]  at the present time.
[01:57:00.207 --> 01:57:01.028]  That's quite obvious.
[01:57:01.770 --> 01:57:12.038]  Our only alternative then is to work at the local level, the state level, and that kind of work will serve us in very good stead if we find a system coming down on our heads through economic breakdown.
[01:57:12.359 --> 01:57:22.287]  And sir, that's why, for the listeners, that's why they're moving to totally federalize the states, because they know that is the grassroots solution to remove this tyranny.
[01:57:22.307 --> 01:57:24.709]  And we have open foreign banks under war powers.
[01:57:25.249 --> 01:57:28.131]  Telling Congress that they're basically under martial law.
[01:57:28.191 --> 01:57:29.933]  That's in mainstream newspapers now.
[01:57:30.273 --> 01:57:34.956]  This thing is so illegitimate, all we have to do is point out the emperor has no clothes.
[01:57:35.457 --> 01:57:35.777]  That's right.
[01:57:35.837 --> 01:57:42.262]  And the other side of that coin, though, of course, is that the window of opportunity that's open also will be closing.
[01:57:42.302 --> 01:57:43.463]  We will run out of time.
[01:57:43.503 --> 01:57:48.867]  We cannot sit on our hands indefinitely because we are the ones that will make it happen or it will not happen.
[01:57:49.833 --> 01:57:50.554]  That's the key.
[01:57:51.014 --> 01:57:55.497]  And even if they bring in tyranny and try to block all of this, that's just more evidence for folks.
[01:57:55.738 --> 01:58:02.543]  The founders, for as you know, the Committees of Correspondence, the Sons of Liberty, tried for decades to fix things peaceably.
[01:58:03.764 --> 01:58:05.545]  Well that's right, and of course that's my goal.
[01:58:05.585 --> 01:58:15.713]  We don't want to see the situation develop into any kind of violence, rioting, really that type of breakdown in social and economic affairs.
[01:58:16.408 --> 01:58:26.112]  But the only way to deter that or prevent that from happening is by the American people themselves reasserting control over this system from the grassroots up.
[01:58:27.273 --> 01:58:30.574]  That's the way we're going to avoid real chaos in this society.
[01:58:31.542 --> 01:58:35.223]  And anyone who thinks that that's not the key to it, I think you're living in a dream world.
[01:58:35.263 --> 01:58:36.264]  All history proves that.
[01:58:36.604 --> 01:58:45.127]  If the people themselves don't take control of their own government, then they're going to be subject to whatever terrible things others want to foist on them.
[01:58:45.267 --> 01:58:45.948]  It is the law.
[01:58:46.068 --> 01:58:49.809]  It is the law of men, the law of nature, the law of nature's God.
[01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:53.410]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, we salute you and thank you for spending time with us.
[01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:54.311]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:54.791 --> 01:58:55.211]  Take care.
[01:58:55.291 --> 01:58:56.011]  Have a great New Year.
[01:58:58.212 --> 01:58:59.953]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:59:01.730 --> 01:59:04.071]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:07.333 --> 01:59:08.734]  It is a big idea.
[01:59:08.754 --> 01:59:10.856]  A new world order.
[01:59:11.576 --> 01:59:16.319]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:59:16.459 --> 01:59:19.281]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:59:19.301 --> 01:59:21.542]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:59:22.082 --> 01:59:24.484]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:59:25.243 --> 01:59:32.625]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:35.606 --> 01:59:40.548]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:41.053 --> 01:59:44.515]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:44.915 --> 01:59:47.397]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:47.477 --> 01:59:48.618]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:48.638 --> 01:59:49.418]  They're not after money.
[01:59:49.438 --> 01:59:50.499]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:50.719 --> 01:59:51.439]  They're after power.
[01:59:51.679 --> 01:59:52.540]  That's what they're after.
[01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:57.383]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:59:57.583 --> 02:00:01.105]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:01.545 --> 02:00:03.887]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:00:04.367 --> 02:00:05.528]  You have been warned.
[02:00:09.452 --> 02:00:11.333]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:11.833 --> 02:00:14.795]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.142 --> 02:00:34.927]  Alright, we are now already, hard to believe, into the final hour of this worldwide transmission.
[02:00:36.869 --> 02:00:41.332]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:42.813 --> 02:00:43.914]  This happens occasionally.
[02:00:43.954 --> 02:00:46.356]  We've had Professor Chossadowski on scores of times.
[02:00:47.417 --> 02:00:55.883]  His number is saying it's disconnected, so we're having some phone line issues getting him in Canada, but we'll get an alternate number.
[02:00:57.084 --> 02:00:59.866]  And from Global Research, we'll call their office.
[02:01:01.021 --> 02:01:03.403]  Or we can call the radio outfit he's on, where they get the numbers there.
[02:01:04.063 --> 02:01:13.130]  But if not, we will just open the phones up in this hour and cover all the news, much of which I haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:01:15.032 --> 02:01:18.874]  I really want to take some time out now to commend the crew.
[02:01:18.894 --> 02:01:20.874]  I want to commend David.
[02:01:20.914 --> 02:01:23.175]  I want to commend Paul Hartman.
[02:01:23.355 --> 02:01:25.996]  I want to commend Jaron, the latest addition to our crew.
[02:01:26.016 --> 02:01:32.439]  I want to commend everybody here at the InfoWars Command Center in South Austin.
[02:01:33.239 --> 02:01:36.841]  And I want to thank all the AMINFM affiliates, Global Shortwave affiliates,
[02:01:37.941 --> 02:01:41.663]  Everybody that makes this broadcast possible, and my team works very hard.
[02:01:43.524 --> 02:01:52.268]  It's very complex what we do here, and we're trying to learn, we're trying to make things better, we're trying to expand, and we put in a lot of long hours to bring you this information.
[02:01:52.288 --> 02:01:55.410]  And of course, I want to thank you, the listeners, the viewers of this radio show.
[02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:58.331]  When I say this, it's not to toot our horn.
[02:01:58.371 --> 02:02:01.353]  In fact, it's almost crushing.
[02:02:01.413 --> 02:02:05.215]  It's not daunting, it's booing that we're affecting so many people and reaching so many people.
[02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:19.216]  But it's also frightening in a way because to realize the responsibility we have that tens of millions of people, more than tens of millions, have seen my 21 films.
[02:02:19.776 --> 02:02:20.858]  This we can track on the web.
[02:02:22.611 --> 02:02:28.094]  And to know that tens of millions have tuned into my radio show, and hundreds of millions on the thousands of radio interviews I've done.
[02:02:28.695 --> 02:02:29.315]  Hundreds of millions.
[02:02:30.115 --> 02:02:36.059]  Coast-to-coast AM, 16 million per show, per evening, and I've been on that more than a hundred times.
[02:02:36.919 --> 02:02:43.824]  And all the other radio shows, and TV, and Russian TV, and British TV, and Japanese TV, and French television, Spanish television.
[02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:50.788]  Today, it's already aired on their main TV station in
[02:02:53.223 --> 02:02:57.128]  On their main TV station in South Africa.
[02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:59.431]  In their major city.
[02:03:00.372 --> 02:03:01.514]  Capital City aired today.
[02:03:01.534 --> 02:03:02.795]  Endgame aired there.
[02:03:04.538 --> 02:03:05.519]  I had them air it for free.
[02:03:05.579 --> 02:03:06.420]  I don't charge.
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:09.564]  I just want to get the information out, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:10.526 --> 02:03:12.347]  And so we do have Professor Michel Chossodosky.
[02:03:12.367 --> 02:03:14.889]  We'll come back to him after this quick break.
[02:03:14.909 --> 02:03:15.810]  We're almost out of time.
[02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:25.076]  I did want to just encourage, at least once in this four hours today, for folks to go to InfoWars.com and financially support us because we've got to have financing somehow.
[02:03:25.136 --> 02:03:31.140]  Plus, these are great books and videos we carry and books I've written and other books and videos we carry, like The Money Master.
[02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:32.200]  Three and a half hours long.
[02:03:32.601 --> 02:03:36.984]  You want a real master's degree in how the private Federal Reserve Crime Syndicate operates worldwide in the U.S.
[02:03:37.384 --> 02:03:40.046]  This is just unbelievably powerful and well done.
[02:03:40.786 --> 02:03:44.468]  And it's 1995, it's like 25 bucks everywhere else I've seen it.
[02:03:45.548 --> 02:03:48.670]  Fabled Enemies that I produced that Jason Burmisk made, our newest 9-11 film.
[02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:58.514]  It's into the Israeli connection and the phone companies and foreshadowing the terrorists and clearly involved in Barry Jennings who died, Joe Biden's in it, Mike Rivero, Bo Dietl.
[02:04:00.822 --> 02:04:08.004]  Former NYPD detective, head of detectives, Michael J. Springman, Visa Department, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, talking about the terrorists working for the CIA.
[02:04:08.544 --> 02:04:10.444]  Cynthia McKinney, former member of Congress.
[02:04:11.624 --> 02:04:15.725]  I mean, this is an important film right here, and people need to see Fabled Enemies.
[02:04:15.765 --> 02:04:16.385]  It needs to get out.
[02:04:16.445 --> 02:04:18.946]  I mean, this is the DVD.
[02:04:18.986 --> 02:04:20.066]  This is the high-quality digital.
[02:04:20.106 --> 02:04:21.006]  This is what folks need.
[02:04:21.266 --> 02:04:24.227]  So I hope you'll all go there, and if you've got the money, buy 10, 15 copies.
[02:04:24.247 --> 02:04:26.087]  We've got discounts on them if you do.

[02:04:27.168 --> 02:04:28.248]  Get Endgame.
[02:04:28.308 --> 02:04:29.088]  Get Terror Storm.

[02:04:31.685 --> 02:04:32.746]  Support him and our work.
[02:04:32.766 --> 02:04:34.166]  The Resistance Manifesto.
[02:04:34.246 --> 02:04:34.806]  Excellent book.
[02:04:35.406 --> 02:04:36.666]  Our newest film we're carrying.
[02:04:37.487 --> 02:04:40.487]  It has an extra bonus film on it and a free audio CD.
[02:04:40.767 --> 02:04:42.608]  So two films and an audio CD.
[02:04:42.628 --> 02:04:44.308]  1995, The World According to Monsanto.
[02:04:44.328 --> 02:04:47.689]  It's got a little booklet inside of it as well.
[02:04:47.709 --> 02:04:51.590]  I mean, that's just some of what we're doing here and we need your support.
[02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:53.750]  So, InfoWars.com.
[02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:55.931]  Secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.

[02:05:17.054 --> 02:05:19.996]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:05:20.156 --> 02:05:25.379]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:05:25.679 --> 02:05:31.022]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:05:31.403 --> 02:05:32.503]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:32.864 --> 02:05:41.769]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[02:05:42.189 --> 02:05:43.811]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[02:05:44.011 --> 02:05:48.196]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[02:05:48.236 --> 02:05:52.861]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[02:05:53.262 --> 02:05:55.605]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[02:05:57.086 --> 02:05:57.866]  Keep it natural.

[02:06:11.789 --> 02:06:15.729]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:23.271]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:06:23.631 --> 02:06:25.291]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:06:26.266 --> 02:06:27.307]  But who is the enemy?
[02:06:27.807 --> 02:06:28.328]  Bin Laden.
[02:06:28.628 --> 02:06:29.589]  This is his ammo.
[02:06:29.609 --> 02:06:30.909]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:06:30.970 --> 02:06:32.651]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:06:32.971 --> 02:06:39.736]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:06:40.116 --> 02:06:40.557]  Some U.S.
[02:06:40.617 --> 02:06:46.261]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:06:46.961 --> 02:06:50.443]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:06:50.463 --> 02:07:00.689]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:07:00.929 --> 02:07:01.670]  Fabled enemies.
[02:07:02.150 --> 02:07:09.454]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:09.915 --> 02:07:13.277]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:07:17.398 --> 02:07:22.940]  IonicZone.com has the best prices on commercial shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:30.782]  But did you know IonicZone.com also sells a water ozonator that's a must-have for anyone interested in good health?
[02:07:31.182 --> 02:07:31.622]  It's true.
[02:07:31.882 --> 02:07:40.665]  The IonicZone digital water ozonator features an air intake and can be fed dry air through the supplied air dryer or pure oxygen via an oxygen tank.
[02:07:41.045 --> 02:07:50.531]  Ozone-fortified water can be used to kill bacteria, sanitize food, produce, and eliminates bacteria in the mouth by gargling, which helps prevent bad breath and even heart disease.
[02:07:50.912 --> 02:07:57.516]  The optional ozone bidet attachment is used for personal hygiene, which can kill the bacteria down below that can lead to irritation.
[02:07:57.896 --> 02:08:00.758]  It's amazing what three atoms of oxygen can do!
[02:08:01.139 --> 02:08:02.559]  Call Ionic Zone today at 1-800-549-9535.
[02:08:02.579 --> 02:08:02.800]  That's 1-800-549-9535.
[02:08:10.845 --> 02:08:13.229]  Put them on the web at ioniczone.com.
[02:08:13.289 --> 02:08:15.533]  That's ioniczone.com today.
[02:08:15.553 --> 02:08:22.806]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:26.052 --> 02:08:38.423]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour after Professor Chasidowski leaves us, breaking down the current geopolitical stuff going on in the Middle East and Israel with Gaza bombardment and the India-Pakistan situation.
[02:08:38.443 --> 02:08:39.644]  I want to get his analysis on that.
[02:08:39.685 --> 02:08:40.325]  We respect it.
[02:08:42.287 --> 02:08:44.869]  Trans-Texas Corridor is dead, TxDOT says.
[02:08:45.310 --> 02:08:48.092]  KVUE Television, Austin, Texas.
[02:08:49.574 --> 02:08:50.534]  I don't believe this for a minute.
[02:08:50.755 --> 02:08:55.016]  This is more possum playing, but the fact that they're having to do this is a big victory, so we'll talk about that.
[02:08:55.416 --> 02:08:59.378]  Let's go directly to Professor Chossadowsky joining us from Canada.
[02:08:59.438 --> 02:09:02.379]  Works with, of course, GlobalResearch.ca.
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:11.543]  Sir, break down your take on what is really unfolding in the world right now, and is this Gaza situation the beginning of a wider conflict?
[02:09:11.663 --> 02:09:15.204]  Is this the unpopular move by Obama when he goes into office?
[02:09:15.224 --> 02:09:16.085]  Will he deploy U.S.
[02:09:16.125 --> 02:09:18.886]  troops in the Gaza Strip and other areas?
[02:09:21.075 --> 02:09:23.376]  Well, that's a very difficult question.
[02:09:23.816 --> 02:09:28.759]  I don't think that the United States is going to deploy troops.
[02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:49.129]  What is possible is that some of Israeli's Middle Eastern allies will participate in some kind of peacekeeping operation, which in effect is a form of interference
[02:09:49.853 --> 02:09:52.174]  I'm thinking specifically of Turkey.
[02:09:52.374 --> 02:09:58.118]  Turkey and Israel have a very close military cooperation agreement.
[02:09:58.658 --> 02:10:01.119]  They exchange intelligence.
[02:10:01.139 --> 02:10:02.740]  They have joint military production.
[02:10:03.321 --> 02:10:17.108]  So a country like Turkey would be more likely to intervene and would, of course, also have some acceptance by the local Palestinian population who are unaware of these
[02:10:18.911 --> 02:10:20.212]  Military intelligence ties.
[02:10:22.974 --> 02:10:28.937]  The question is, what kind of stance will the Obama administration take upon assuming office?
[02:10:29.057 --> 02:10:31.579]  I don't see a major shift in foreign policy.
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:36.502]  There may be a shift in rhetoric, but I don't see a major shift in foreign policy.
[02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:38.143]  What do you think the big surprise is?
[02:10:38.183 --> 02:10:41.125]  And then let's break down Gaza.
[02:10:42.146 --> 02:10:47.049]  Well, as you suggest, they now want to
[02:10:47.921 --> 02:10:51.022]  Cut Gaza into several strips, okay?
[02:10:51.162 --> 02:10:52.923]  It's a pretty small area to start with.
[02:10:53.343 --> 02:10:54.023]  It's siege.
[02:10:54.063 --> 02:10:55.244]  We see a siege going on.
[02:10:56.204 --> 02:10:57.804]  It's a siege.
[02:10:58.905 --> 02:11:08.488]  And as I pointed out in my earlier article, this siege has been on the drawing board for quite a number of years.
[02:11:09.969 --> 02:11:15.651]  And there are a number of events in recent history which have prepared for this siege.
[02:11:15.811 --> 02:11:16.271]  One was the
[02:11:16.747 --> 02:11:38.442]  Assassination of Arafat, which led to this this breakup of the Palestinian movement and Palestinian authority, but also the the removal of all Jewish settlements from Gaza, which at the time, as you recall, was interpreted as a so-called victory for the Palestinian people.
[02:11:38.922 --> 02:11:41.964]  And it was part of the so-called roadmap, the U.S.
[02:11:42.104 --> 02:11:44.506]  sponsored roadmap to peace, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:11:44.526 --> 02:11:45.827]  But in effect, what it was,
[02:11:46.345 --> 02:11:46.545]  What's
[02:12:16.630 --> 02:12:44.736]  Of course, what bothers us tremendously is the grip that the Anglo-American, but I would say mainly American, because now in Europe this seems to be a slightly different slant, but the grip that the US media has on public opinion, where they present this invasion, the killings of civilians, the children, the use of prohibited weapons, they present this as
[02:12:46.406 --> 02:13:03.536]  As legitimate retribution for the actions of Hamas, the rocket attack, without understanding the whole context and without understanding the asymmetry and the loss of life.
[02:13:03.556 --> 02:13:03.916]  Okay?
[02:13:04.036 --> 02:13:07.478]  We're talking about 17 deaths in Israel over the last seven years.
[02:13:09.119 --> 02:13:13.922]  And if you look on the Palestinian side over the same period, talking about more than a thousand deaths,
[02:13:14.908 --> 02:13:20.791]  And so, but people don't seem to be, they don't seem to understand that.
[02:13:21.691 --> 02:13:25.473]  There's been 40 plus at the UN school alone today.
[02:13:26.833 --> 02:13:27.914]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:13:28.174 --> 02:13:28.714]  Absolutely.
[02:13:28.754 --> 02:13:36.277]  And they're bombing schools, hospitals, universities.
[02:13:37.018 --> 02:13:40.139]  And if this were to happen anywhere else in the world,
[02:13:41.256 --> 02:13:47.360]  Uh, it would be, it would be, you know, you'd already have a war crimes tribunal set up and so on and so forth.
[02:13:48.001 --> 02:14:08.375]  Now, um, the people who have now, we're now suggesting Francis Boyle, professor of law, a good, good, uh, good friend and colleague of mine who, uh, who is now suggesting the formation of a, of a tribunal, a war crimes tribunal, um, to try the,
[02:14:09.439 --> 02:14:12.282]  The Israeli war criminals and their U.S.
[02:14:12.822 --> 02:14:13.443]  counterparts.
[02:14:13.563 --> 02:14:18.948]  Because this is not strictly an Israeli operation.
[02:14:19.248 --> 02:14:21.550]  This is an international colonial operation.
[02:14:21.850 --> 02:14:30.218]  And by the way, Mr. Boyle, who we've interviewed many times, he's written international treaties for the United States in the U.N., so he's very prestigious to be saying that.
[02:14:31.499 --> 02:14:32.279]  Absolutely, yes.
[02:14:32.359 --> 02:14:34.301]  No, he's a very distinguished lawyer.
[02:14:35.783 --> 02:14:39.926]  And he has taken a stance on Palestine for quite a number of years.
[02:14:41.287 --> 02:14:55.455]  But I think what people have to understand is that this operation is part of a plan which was established in the early 90s under the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
[02:14:55.796 --> 02:14:56.416]  In fact, in 2001.
[02:14:56.556 --> 02:14:57.016]  The 1948 option.
[02:15:00.410 --> 02:15:06.131]  Well, well, there was a 1948 option, which is to is to expel the Palestinians.
[02:15:06.191 --> 02:15:22.875]  But the actual process of attacking the territories, breaking them up, establishing proxy regimes was part of a plan which was called Justified Vengeance.
[02:15:23.795 --> 02:15:24.955]  The title is interesting.
[02:15:25.135 --> 02:15:27.696]  Justified Operation Justified Vengeance.
[02:15:28.294 --> 02:15:32.335]  Now Operation Justified Vengeance was launched in 2001.
[02:15:33.176 --> 02:15:41.919]  It was presented just after accession of Ariel Sharon to the position of Prime Minister.
[02:15:41.939 --> 02:15:56.244]  It was presented by the Chief of Staff of the so-called Israeli Defense Forces under the title, quote, the destruction of the Palestinian Authority and the disarmament of all armed forces.
[02:15:56.826 --> 02:16:04.388]  The term justified vengeance was was was there and it was commented at the time even by the by the US press.
[02:16:05.588 --> 02:16:24.973]  And then we we understood that this plan was in fact it was it was designed by Mayor Dagan and Mayor Dagan was the national security advisor to Ariel Sharon during his election campaign.
[02:16:25.976 --> 02:16:30.920]  He was then promoted to heading Mossad.
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:33.021]  So he is the current head of Mossad.
[02:16:33.441 --> 02:16:38.245]  They actually call him Dagan the Gun.
[02:16:38.725 --> 02:16:39.606]  Dagan the Gun.
[02:16:40.487 --> 02:16:41.227]  The Top Gun.
[02:16:41.908 --> 02:16:45.490]  He's the top spy of Israel.
[02:16:46.011 --> 02:16:51.495]  And so this Operation Justified Vengeance is also referred to as the Dagan Plan.
[02:16:53.917 --> 02:17:05.662]  And the whole idea of the Duggan Plan of Operation Justified Vengeance is to say, we need the suicide attacks so that we can then enter on acts of retribution.
[02:17:05.782 --> 02:17:10.985]  So that they would actually time, they would do scenarios.
[02:17:11.045 --> 02:17:13.786]  They say, okay, there's going to be a suicide attack.
[02:17:15.127 --> 02:17:20.469]  We want those suicide attacks to occur because then it gives us the pretext
[02:17:21.078 --> 02:17:28.445]  And the legitimacy to to bomb Gaza or the West Bank, you know, and we can use F-16s.
[02:17:28.825 --> 02:17:35.311]  And they started using F-16 jets at the outset of the Dagan plan.
[02:17:35.871 --> 02:17:41.336]  So what's happening today is very much part of a broader agenda.
[02:17:41.863 --> 02:17:50.268]  Now, I recall that I, I mean, we've been, we've published several pieces on this Dagan Plan or Operation Justified Action.
[02:17:50.288 --> 02:17:51.969]  Now, you've been reporting on it for years.
[02:17:52.029 --> 02:17:53.030]  You've been very concerned.
[02:17:53.690 --> 02:17:54.411]  Absolutely.
[02:17:54.531 --> 02:18:05.738]  And the thing is, I went back to some of the writings that we had published, including the writings of Tanya Reinhardt, who is a professor of linguistics at Tel Aviv University.
[02:18:05.758 --> 02:18:08.900]  She's actually a student of Noam Chomsky at MIT.
[02:18:09.878 --> 02:18:16.384]  And she died under very mysterious circumstances a few years ago at age 50 or so.
[02:18:16.465 --> 02:18:18.206]  And she predicted very well.
[02:18:18.226 --> 02:18:19.968]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:18:20.028 --> 02:18:25.293]  I mean, she looked into the whole issue of this Dagan operation.
[02:18:25.313 --> 02:18:34.342]  There were other analysts, but essentially what was envisaged was an invasion, I'm quoting, quote, an invasion of Palestinian controlled territory.
[02:18:34.653 --> 02:18:35.033]  I don't know.
[02:18:57.105 --> 02:19:05.690]  A humanitarian disaster, with a view to ultimately triggering the expulsion of the Palestinian population.
[02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:07.591]  And where will they allow them to flee to?
[02:19:07.611 --> 02:19:09.011]  Because Egypt isn't letting them in.
[02:19:10.212 --> 02:19:11.213]  Will they flee to the sea?
[02:19:12.013 --> 02:19:19.317]  They could flee to Jordan, they could flee to Egypt, they could come to some agreement with the Egyptians, because these are allies.
[02:19:20.517 --> 02:19:22.418]  Egypt and Jordan are allies of Israel.
[02:19:24.376 --> 02:19:46.779]  Again, I don't know, I don't want to make any predictions, but I'm just saying this 1948, as you said, the 1948 solution is expulsion, and it looks that they are creating conditions so horrendous that people can simply not survive.
[02:19:47.236 --> 02:19:48.217]  Within their homeland.
[02:19:48.317 --> 02:19:50.438]  I think that is the situation.
[02:19:50.478 --> 02:19:57.943]  Well, this is total seeds cutting off the three major cities and circling them with troops into the ocean, gunboats, and then blasting all their tunnels.
[02:19:57.983 --> 02:20:01.385]  They were bringing in emergency supplies.
[02:20:01.845 --> 02:20:09.810]  So they're completely cut off and under heavy bombardment with their infrastructure, telecommunications, limited water and electrical systems being destroyed.
[02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:13.032]  You have this giant high-tech military doing this.
[02:20:13.973 --> 02:20:15.974]  But in our media, it's good.
[02:20:17.495 --> 02:20:21.399]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:23.902]  Then keep listening for a very special offer!

[02:21:16.649 --> 02:21:22.875]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:21:23.316 --> 02:21:31.104]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:31.444 --> 02:21:37.030]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[02:21:37.350 --> 02:21:39.312]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[02:21:39.592 --> 02:21:44.357]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:44.698 --> 02:21:49.403]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:49.923 --> 02:21:53.787]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:21:54.267 --> 02:21:55.289]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:59.393]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:21:59.833 --> 02:22:04.218]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:04.739 --> 02:22:07.302]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:07.742 --> 02:22:09.404]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:09.524 --> 02:22:09.744]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:15.931 --> 02:22:17.932]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[02:22:18.052 --> 02:22:20.453]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:22:20.473 --> 02:22:23.074]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:22:23.094 --> 02:22:24.274]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:22:24.294 --> 02:22:25.915]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:22:26.015 --> 02:22:28.856]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:22:28.896 --> 02:22:32.538]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:22:42.188 --> 02:22:47.113]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:22:47.333 --> 02:22:49.495]  An inside job?
[02:22:50.857 --> 02:22:52.438]  How dare you?
[02:22:53.299 --> 02:22:58.364]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:22:58.384 --> 02:23:00.567]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:23:00.687 --> 02:23:02.048]  And if the government has not told the truth!
[02:23:04.451 --> 02:23:07.133]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:23:07.233 --> 02:23:11.637]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:23:11.657 --> 02:23:14.779]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:23:31.152 --> 02:23:41.495]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:23:41.855 --> 02:23:47.397]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:23:47.617 --> 02:23:53.679]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:23:53.879 --> 02:23:54.539]  What about you?

[02:24:38.237 --> 02:24:41.178]  Professor Chossudovsky will be with us until about 40 after.
[02:24:41.198 --> 02:24:44.419]  I'm going to break down some new developing news.
[02:24:45.279 --> 02:24:53.342]  We're going to talk a little bit more about geopolitically what's happening with the military in this short segment.
[02:24:53.922 --> 02:25:01.464]  Then for a few more minutes after I'm going to get into the economic situation, which is Professor Chossudovsky's real specialty in a conference they're having.
[02:25:01.484 --> 02:25:03.665]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[02:25:05.987 --> 02:25:09.348]  Okay, Professor, India, Pakistan, that clearly was staged.
[02:25:09.368 --> 02:25:10.529]  A lot of evidence to that effect.
[02:25:10.549 --> 02:25:15.231]  I had General Hamid Gul on and others to cover that a few weeks ago.
[02:25:15.251 --> 02:25:22.234]  I want to get into that briefly, but first, putting a bow on this monstrosity, how do you see it unfolding?
[02:25:22.274 --> 02:25:27.896]  How many months will the siege go before they break the back and try to start expelling the people there in Gaza?
[02:25:30.277 --> 02:25:34.019]  That's very difficult to see at the moment.
[02:25:35.586 --> 02:25:43.128]  If we recall back in 1999, the aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia went on for several months.
[02:25:44.148 --> 02:25:46.789]  It started in March and they finished in June.
[02:25:48.129 --> 02:25:54.430]  And I don't think that this operation will go on for a very long time.
[02:25:54.470 --> 02:25:56.651]  But I mean, there's going to be urban warfare.
[02:25:58.711 --> 02:26:02.252]  But it's very difficult to predict.
[02:26:03.339 --> 02:26:18.571]  It's very difficult to predict because the Israelis are completely off onto something which is diabolical and they want to carry it through and they believe that they're right.
[02:26:19.072 --> 02:26:21.954]  They have this self-righteousness.
[02:26:24.917 --> 02:26:26.078]  I'm not providing a very
[02:26:27.045 --> 02:26:29.487]  That's a very coherent answer to a question.
[02:26:29.787 --> 02:26:36.592]  Well, we've already seen more than a thousand injured, and what is it, up to like 500 dead now, and that's probably conservative numbers.
[02:26:37.053 --> 02:26:41.917]  I mean, how many... it's just going to go on and on, and Israel doesn't care.
[02:26:41.937 --> 02:26:47.721]  I saw a London Guardian article saying Obama doesn't know this is destroying his name, his silence.
[02:26:47.781 --> 02:26:49.142]  Of course Obama knows.
[02:26:49.643 --> 02:26:55.087]  Obama, I mean, his administration's headed up by a known Israeli operative, IDF person.
[02:26:56.272 --> 02:26:56.972]  Absolutely.
[02:26:57.472 --> 02:27:02.133]  Well, Obama is saying that he cannot act until he's President of the United States.
[02:27:03.093 --> 02:27:07.234]  And I don't think that he would act any differently.
[02:27:07.294 --> 02:27:09.674]  There might be a little bit of rhetoric thrown in.
[02:27:10.075 --> 02:27:12.015]  Well, you know, he weighs in on everything else.
[02:27:15.055 --> 02:27:15.736]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:27:16.416 --> 02:27:18.576]  He's commenting on every other issue.
[02:27:19.616 --> 02:27:23.177]  What do you expect Obama's stance to be once he's in there January 20th?
[02:27:24.929 --> 02:27:31.492]  Well, I think that Obama is very clearly aligned with a Zionist, Israeli-Zionist agenda.
[02:27:31.652 --> 02:27:37.895]  That's very clear in terms of the people he's appointed, in terms of his links to AIPAC.
[02:27:38.936 --> 02:27:50.562]  He is, but at the same time he has, you know, he has this ability to present himself as a humanitarian spokesperson.
[02:27:54.506 --> 02:28:06.417]  You know, some people have said that he is presenting a double image, you know, and in reality what he's doing is continuity.
[02:28:07.238 --> 02:28:10.141]  It's the continuity of the Bush administration.
[02:28:10.221 --> 02:28:12.503]  It's continuity in foreign policy.
[02:28:12.523 --> 02:28:18.128]  He's keeping on Gates as Secretary of Defense.
[02:28:19.589 --> 02:28:24.691]  Which means that, in effect, there's not going to be any major upheaval in the military.
[02:28:24.711 --> 02:28:30.894]  Yeah, they're passing the baton, but as Kissinger said on CNBC yesterday, oh, the great image of him in the world.
[02:28:30.914 --> 02:28:33.755]  We're going to be able to really get our agenda through with Obama.
[02:28:33.776 --> 02:28:35.416]  I mean, he's cynically admitting it.
[02:28:36.857 --> 02:28:37.597]  Absolutely.
[02:28:37.637 --> 02:28:45.481]  Well, that is the whole idea, is that you get Obama, who is an African-American, who has
[02:28:46.454 --> 02:29:06.071]  Has the rhetoric to appeal to grassroots opinion in America, who has the support of people in Africa, because, you know, he has historical links to Kenya, and provides an image, but that image is false.
[02:29:06.211 --> 02:29:09.795]  I'm trying to find a polite word, but it is phony.
[02:29:10.315 --> 02:29:11.256]  It's a phony image.
[02:29:12.509 --> 02:29:14.310]  It's the nice guy with the bad guy.
[02:29:14.430 --> 02:29:18.911]  It's a cloaking device.
[02:29:19.931 --> 02:29:26.772]  Bush, at least you could say he's more sincere because his image fits his job description.
[02:29:26.832 --> 02:29:29.313]  Very, very arrogant and just said, I don't care.
[02:29:29.333 --> 02:29:31.213]  Yeah, he says, I don't care.
[02:29:31.253 --> 02:29:35.134]  But Obama will say deep down, he said, I don't care.
[02:29:35.294 --> 02:29:38.255]  But up front, he'll say something else.
[02:29:39.099 --> 02:29:43.464]  So, yeah, it's a policy of deceit.
[02:29:44.745 --> 02:29:46.226]  And people didn't vote for that.
[02:29:46.326 --> 02:29:47.968]  They voted for the rhetoric.
[02:29:48.028 --> 02:29:51.232]  They voted because they thought that this was... Stay there.
[02:29:51.392 --> 02:29:51.672]  Stay there.
[02:29:51.692 --> 02:29:54.335]  Let's talk about India, Pakistan, and then the economy briefly when we get back.
[02:29:54.915 --> 02:29:55.196]  All right?
[02:29:55.276 --> 02:29:56.417]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:56.977 --> 02:29:59.180]  Professor Michelle Chossudovsky is our guest.
[02:30:06.966 --> 02:30:09.929]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:09.949 --> 02:30:13.734]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:16.917 --> 02:30:21.442]  Phase 1 of the Insiders Plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[02:30:23.499 --> 02:30:24.219]  We're good to go.
[02:30:52.459 --> 02:30:56.061]  www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.
[02:30:56.441 --> 02:31:00.003]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com.
[02:31:00.063 --> 02:31:03.464]  To learn how to prepare for the unthinkable, don't wait for empty shelves.
[02:31:03.764 --> 02:31:06.666]  Learn how to make your own survival foods for pennies on the dollar.
[02:31:06.806 --> 02:31:09.607]  Go to foodshortageusa.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:31:09.647 --> 02:31:09.907]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:16.934 --> 02:31:23.319]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:31:23.700 --> 02:31:25.681]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:31:26.342 --> 02:31:27.362]  But who is the enemy?
[02:31:27.903 --> 02:31:28.403]  Bin Laden.
[02:31:28.704 --> 02:31:29.604]  This is his ammo.
[02:31:29.624 --> 02:31:31.045]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:31:31.065 --> 02:31:32.767]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:31:33.047 --> 02:31:39.812]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:31:40.213 --> 02:31:40.653]  Some U.S.
[02:31:40.693 --> 02:31:46.358]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:31:47.018 --> 02:31:50.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:53.321]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:32:16.823 --> 02:32:20.944]  Are you one of the people who think, I have plenty of time, nothing's ever going to happen bad to me?
[02:32:21.044 --> 02:32:26.366]  Do you believe that when your cupboards are bare, our corporate controlled government will jump right in to feed you and yours?
[02:32:26.506 --> 02:32:29.247]  Do you have at least a year's supply of food for your family?
[02:32:29.387 --> 02:32:32.068]  This is Kurt, the armchair survivalist heard on this network.
[02:32:32.188 --> 02:32:35.009]  Survival Enterprises sells real food canned for long term survival.
[02:32:37.227 --> 02:32:45.093]  These eggs, freeze-dried fruits and vegetables, Mountain House freeze-dried meals, MREs, a full nutritional line, the British Birkfeld water filter, and more.
[02:32:45.233 --> 02:32:48.175]  If you want to prepare now, go to BeforeIt'sTooLate.us.
[02:32:48.215 --> 02:32:50.236]  That's BeforeIt'sTooLate.us.
[02:32:50.396 --> 02:32:51.377]  Or call 1-800-753-1981.
[02:32:52.438 --> 02:32:55.840]  That's 1-800-753-1981.
[02:32:55.960 --> 02:33:00.143]  Or you can put your head in the sand and be just another sheeple in the corporate-controlled flock.
[02:33:00.223 --> 02:33:03.606]  But remember, those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it.
[02:33:04.930 --> 02:33:05.512]  Yeah!
[02:33:05.673 --> 02:33:06.014]  Yeah!
[02:33:32.182 --> 02:33:35.844]  Moving quickly here in our final segment with Professor Chastodosky.
[02:33:37.125 --> 02:33:40.668]  The India-Pakistan situation four weeks ago.
[02:33:42.209 --> 02:33:50.514]  From your research, your group of researchers' analysis, do you see the same footprints of an orchestrated, staged, provocative event?
[02:33:54.216 --> 02:33:56.178]  You're talking about... I'm sorry?
[02:33:56.198 --> 02:33:57.258]  The Mumbai attacks.
[02:33:57.739 --> 02:33:59.119]  Yes, of course, the Mumbai attacks.
[02:34:00.225 --> 02:34:08.330]  Well, the Mumbai attacks was, I think, certainly a staged event.
[02:34:10.051 --> 02:34:18.777]  It was intended to push Pakistan and India against one another.
[02:34:18.797 --> 02:34:26.962]  It was perpetrated, I believe it was an intelligence operation.
[02:34:28.424 --> 02:34:41.948]  The alleged terror groups behind these attacks are supported by Pakistani intelligence, the ISI, which in turn is in liaison with the CIA.
[02:34:43.448 --> 02:34:52.851]  I think the purpose of these attacks was, in fact, to create a situation of conflict between two countries, which
[02:34:53.576 --> 02:34:56.598]  In recent months, we're actually moving together again.
[02:34:56.919 --> 02:35:14.431]  And we saw the fake phone call, but they confirmed with a caller ID, so it wasn't a fake call, they claimed that, from the Indian Foreign Ministry to the Pakistani government saying, we're going to attack you, and then it almost caused a conflict, and now the troops are massing right when they were coming to reconciliation.
[02:35:14.451 --> 02:35:19.976]  You have all the intelligence operatives involved, leading other terror attacks, absolutely.
[02:35:20.316 --> 02:35:21.657]  Where do you see that going in the future?
[02:35:23.069 --> 02:35:36.375]  Well, again, right from the outset of this event, Pakistan has started to amass troops along its border.
[02:35:39.196 --> 02:35:44.098]  Again, it's very difficult to predict what might happen.
[02:35:44.559 --> 02:35:46.039]  We're in very interesting times.
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:49.561]  Yes, we're in very uncertain times.
[02:35:51.416 --> 02:35:55.637]  But on the other hand, in both countries, there are people who understand these events.
[02:35:58.137 --> 02:36:09.579]  In Pakistan, there are people in the government who understand that their own intelligence agencies are in fact involved in sabotaging the political process.
[02:36:11.980 --> 02:36:18.941]  When I was reviewing the situation in Pakistan, one thing that came to my attention was that
[02:36:19.744 --> 02:36:29.503]  That the head of Pakistani intelligence was appointed with the approval of the United States, bypassing the civilian administration.
[02:36:31.557 --> 02:36:35.481]  The government, and they had a whole series of military appointments.
[02:36:35.521 --> 02:36:39.124]  Yeah, there's multiple governments within Pakistan itself.
[02:36:39.265 --> 02:36:51.457]  In closing, in the three or four minutes we've got left with you, Professor, give us your basic bowl down on the economy, where it's going, the banks openly announcing world government of and by the Madoff-type banks, saying we'll pay carbon taxes to them.
[02:36:52.318 --> 02:36:54.260]  Break that down and tell us about the conference coming up.
[02:36:55.373 --> 02:37:00.556]  Well, it's easier for me to tell you about the conference in a very short period of time.
[02:37:00.856 --> 02:37:02.557]  We're organizing an event.
[02:37:02.757 --> 02:37:07.879]  It's the Center for Research on Globalization, which is based in Montreal, downtown Montreal.
[02:37:08.359 --> 02:37:15.363]  We're organizing an event next Wednesday, Wednesday of next week, sorry, the 14th of January.
[02:37:16.112 --> 02:37:17.893]  Thank you.
[02:37:36.776 --> 02:37:39.338]  And you can always contact us by email.
[02:37:39.398 --> 02:37:41.639]  I know that a number of people are coming from out of town.
[02:37:41.919 --> 02:37:45.341]  Okay, but in closing, in the few minutes, I've got three minutes left here, and we're going to move on.
[02:37:45.361 --> 02:37:46.421]  We appreciate your time with us.
[02:37:47.042 --> 02:37:49.603]  Briefly, the world economic crisis in two minutes.
[02:37:50.563 --> 02:38:03.910]  Well, in two minutes, I'd focus on one issue which has not been addressed in any meaningful way, even by the critics, is that the handouts under the bailouts
[02:38:04.639 --> 02:38:08.881]  The various bailouts, not only the $700 billion, OK?
[02:38:08.921 --> 02:38:21.927]  We're talking about something of the order of $8.5 trillion of handouts and loans secured by the Treasury or the Federal Reserve.
[02:38:22.387 --> 02:38:25.909]  Now, what this implies is the following.
[02:38:26.709 --> 02:38:30.411]  We're going to have a massive increase in the public debt.
[02:38:30.711 --> 02:38:32.292]  In the United States, the public debt
[02:38:33.192 --> 02:38:33.592]  I think?
[02:39:01.567 --> 02:39:06.950]  You're in a situation where you need to finance these handouts to the banks.
[02:39:07.451 --> 02:39:09.632]  You need to increase the public debt.
[02:39:10.032 --> 02:39:16.636]  And to increase the public debt, you have to borrow from the banks, well, the recipients of the bailouts.
[02:39:16.896 --> 02:39:20.058]  They're borrowing their own money and we're paying for it.
[02:39:20.278 --> 02:39:21.019]  Exactly.
[02:39:21.099 --> 02:39:24.001]  They get the money and we pay to give them the money.
[02:39:24.761 --> 02:39:25.461]  Exactly.
[02:39:25.782 --> 02:39:28.543]  And the other aspect of this is that
[02:39:30.963 --> 02:39:47.194]  If you can't increase, if you can't finance the deficit through the emission of public debt, you have to start slashing expenditures, every single category of expenditures, and you have to start privatizing government state assets and so on.
[02:39:47.695 --> 02:39:49.856]  I suspect that is what's going to happen.
[02:39:50.176 --> 02:39:58.122]  The irony is that those who are receiving the handouts are those who are also imposing the conditions as creditors of the state.
[02:39:58.402 --> 02:39:59.763]  So the state, the US,
[02:40:00.459 --> 02:40:03.569]  Uh, government is financing its own indebtedness at expense.
[02:40:04.677 --> 02:40:06.318]  Of taxpayers.
[02:40:34.997 --> 02:40:35.537]  Exactly.
[02:40:36.037 --> 02:40:39.598]  Well, they are the brokers of the U.S.
[02:40:39.658 --> 02:40:40.419]  public debt.
[02:40:40.799 --> 02:40:42.419]  They don't hold all of the U.S.
[02:40:42.439 --> 02:40:45.580]  public debt, but they are brokers, but they're also creditors.
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:59.004]  So that, in effect, they are the recipients of the handouts and they are the creditors of the state to finance the money that they are going to receive.
[02:40:59.451 --> 02:41:12.221]  So we're in a circular situation where the government is financing its own indebtedness through the handouts to the banks, who are also the creditors and the brokers of public debt and treasury bills.
[02:41:12.441 --> 02:41:16.924]  This is a corporate hijacking, a corporate looting, a total takeover?
[02:41:17.485 --> 02:41:18.265]  Absolutely.
[02:41:18.606 --> 02:41:19.226]  Absolutely.
[02:41:19.246 --> 02:41:20.287]  It's very serious.
[02:41:20.747 --> 02:41:28.253]  So in any event, if people from the United States wish to join us in Montreal, it's only about an hour from the border, less than an hour from the
[02:41:29.296 --> 02:41:37.783]  From the New York State to New Hampshire, drive up to Montreal, and we will be very happy to receive anybody who comes from the United States.
[02:41:37.803 --> 02:41:38.864]  Well, I wish I could join you.
[02:41:38.884 --> 02:41:39.985]  We also have a lot of listeners on.
[02:41:40.005 --> 02:41:45.530]  Yeah, well, you're a bit far off, but we'll... Okay, well... All right, thank you.
[02:41:45.550 --> 02:41:46.291]  Take care, Professor.
[02:41:46.591 --> 02:41:47.892]  Take care, Alex.
[02:41:47.992 --> 02:41:49.574]  Greetings to everybody in Texas.
[02:41:50.310 --> 02:41:51.551]  All right, thank you for spending time with us.
[02:41:51.571 --> 02:41:51.951]  Take care.
[02:41:51.971 --> 02:41:53.352]  There goes the professor.
[02:41:54.253 --> 02:42:02.018]  Yeah, well, we have been making that point over and over and over again, and we made the point before the Banker Takeover Bill that it was a Banker Takeover Bill because the bill said it.
[02:42:02.558 --> 02:42:08.161]  Total martial law, private foreign banks openly owning and running the government, and the Congress is bitching and complaining.
[02:42:08.282 --> 02:42:14.325]  Even Federal Reserve Board governors in the United States have gone to the news and said, this is foreign banks.
[02:42:14.365 --> 02:42:19.449]  This isn't even, you know, local governors of the Federal Reserve who were just titular heads over the private banks.
[02:42:20.509 --> 02:42:22.270]  We're not even allowed to look at what's going on.
[02:42:22.330 --> 02:42:27.491]  We've been told we're under martial law and we've had congressmen on the show to tell you that as well.
[02:42:27.571 --> 02:42:29.652]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[02:42:29.672 --> 02:42:31.272]  I always say that because you can't.
[02:42:31.993 --> 02:42:33.353]  This is totally insane.
[02:42:33.953 --> 02:42:39.175]  This is absolutely, totally and completely off the charts by every yardstick.
[02:42:39.255 --> 02:42:41.756]  This is nothing like this has ever been seen.
[02:42:41.816 --> 02:42:48.818]  Normally the big private central banks go into Nigeria or Costa Rica or Brazil or
[02:42:49.975 --> 02:43:04.098]  Asian countries, and they've done it to hundreds and hundreds, sometimes over and over again in the same nation, and they'll go, here's a billion bucks paid for by American taxpayers mainly, about 60% of IMF World Bank money, but that's all just fiat as well, but it's backed up by the U.S.
[02:43:04.138 --> 02:43:04.558]  military.
[02:43:05.459 --> 02:43:07.019]  We'll give your corrupt dictator a billion bucks.
[02:43:07.859 --> 02:43:13.240]  He keeps it for himself, leaves, and ten years later the country's paid back $50 billion, but never even touched the interest.
[02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:14.280]  It's all interest.
[02:43:14.721 --> 02:43:16.001]  Never getting down the principle.
[02:43:18.393 --> 02:43:19.414]  This is even worse.
[02:43:19.474 --> 02:43:45.116]  This is where the banks bankrupt everything, cut off liquidity to the public, have all the cash and liquidity hoarded to themselves, they openly buy up other banks' insurance companies, and buy off other corporations and other key infrastructure assets mainly, and then we have to pay tax money to them for the private Federal Reserve giving itself all our money.
[02:43:48.137 --> 02:43:50.477]  I mean, that's just unbelievable.
[02:43:51.238 --> 02:43:56.419]  And that's the point I make every day, every day, every day here.
[02:43:56.859 --> 02:43:59.759]  And the public thinks it's bad that they're taking all this money.
[02:43:59.779 --> 02:44:09.221]  We've got to pay it back in taxes, but they don't understand that the groups getting the money are the ones that we've got to pay interest to to give them the money.
[02:44:11.142 --> 02:44:13.602]  That would be like if I had a car dealership and I sold you a $25,000 Mustang and
[02:44:18.166 --> 02:44:23.649]  I gave you the Mustang, and I paid you $25,000 to give you the Mustang.
[02:44:25.450 --> 02:44:36.937]  Here, here's a Mustang, $25,000, brand new, fully loaded, and I'm giving it to you for free, and I'm going to pay you $25,000 to take it for free.
[02:44:38.758 --> 02:44:41.799]  And then, I'm the guy getting the free Mustang and the $25,000.
[02:44:43.516 --> 02:44:47.097]  And I'm going, you're lucky I'm doing this, you're lucky I'm taking care of you, you're lucky I'm taking this.
[02:44:47.637 --> 02:44:50.478]  By the way, if you don't like me taking this, I got troops!
[02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:56.581]  Troops that literally have no idea what planet they're even on.
[02:44:57.221 --> 02:44:59.162]  Police that have no idea, a public that has no idea.
[02:45:00.962 --> 02:45:06.524]  And my concern is, if the scams are this crazy, this wild, this out in the open, what's coming next?
[02:45:07.144 --> 02:45:08.625]  What's the new outrages?
[02:45:09.605 --> 02:45:11.506]  I mean, what more could they come up with?
[02:45:14.542 --> 02:45:17.483]  I want to get into this Trans-Texas Corridor is Dead, TxDOT says.
[02:45:17.523 --> 02:45:19.984]  In fact, let's pull that up so we can just put it on screen for folks.
[02:45:20.924 --> 02:45:23.846]  Trans-Texas Corridor is Dead, TxDOT says.
[02:45:24.146 --> 02:45:25.946]  That just means they'll rename it, but I want to go over that.
[02:45:26.407 --> 02:45:32.589]  But before we do that, here is the newest film that I directed, Truth Rising.
[02:45:33.746 --> 02:45:36.087]  And it's indescribable, everything that it covers.
[02:45:36.127 --> 02:45:51.093]  I mean, it's police telling 9-11 truthers that they're going to plant bombs on them, and saying that video cameras are guns, and it's all these world leaders being confronted, and Joe Biden, and John McCain, and just Bill Clinton, David Rockefeller, the amazing work of Luke Radowsky, and everybody else.
[02:45:51.113 --> 02:45:53.034]  We are changing 9-11 truth groups around the nation.
[02:45:53.054 --> 02:45:55.134]  A lot of it's activist footage, a lot of it's our footage.
[02:45:55.294 --> 02:45:56.515]  This is my cinema verite.
[02:45:56.875 --> 02:45:57.815]  There's no voiceover.
[02:45:58.216 --> 02:46:01.137]  This is the most cinematically skillful film I've ever made.
[02:46:01.897 --> 02:46:03.838]  And it's a totally different angle on 9-11 Truth.
[02:46:04.278 --> 02:46:05.739]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is confronted in here.
[02:46:06.139 --> 02:46:19.846]  So I hope that folks will go to Infowars.com, not just to get a great film for as low as $6.95 when you get it with other videos, but it also supports us and then you get something you can show others to wake them up.
[02:46:20.246 --> 02:46:20.626]  Endgame.
[02:46:20.686 --> 02:46:25.848]  This is now recognized by many as the preeminent overall film about world government and the New World Order.
[02:46:25.868 --> 02:46:28.550]  The best produced, the most information, two and a half hours long.
[02:46:29.130 --> 02:46:30.271]  With 40 minutes of extras.
[02:46:30.812 --> 02:46:34.696]  PrisonPlanet.tv members get an hour and 40 minutes of extra extras called Endgame 1.5.
[02:46:35.137 --> 02:46:40.242]  But here it is, Alex Jones' Endgame and Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:46:41.223 --> 02:46:43.225]  And I certainly do hope that everybody
[02:46:44.637 --> 02:46:47.398]  Out there, we'll go to Infowars.com and order these.
[02:46:47.698 --> 02:46:51.619]  Not just to get a powerful film to give as a gift to wake folks up, but also to financially support us and what we're doing.
[02:46:51.639 --> 02:47:00.861]  You can see we're upgrading, we're trying to expand, we're trying to be more effective, a little bit more glossy, and we're going to even improve things more in the future.
[02:47:02.081 --> 02:47:04.582]  But we need your support, and it goes right back into fighting the New World Order.
[02:47:04.622 --> 02:47:05.922]  So again, Infowars.com.
[02:47:07.526 --> 02:47:11.387]  Or you can call toll-free and ask for all the different combos and specials we've got.
[02:47:11.407 --> 02:47:15.128]  9-11, Inside Job, baseball caps as low as $5.95, t-shirts as low as $5.95.
[02:47:15.188 --> 02:47:16.869]  I mean, that's a cost, folks, for us.
[02:47:18.410 --> 02:47:19.410]  That's a cost, most of them.
[02:47:19.690 --> 02:47:20.610]  Some of them make like a dollar.
[02:47:21.250 --> 02:47:23.231]  And every order gets a free Citizen's Rulebook.
[02:47:23.251 --> 02:47:24.652]  The big orders get multiple copies.
[02:47:25.092 --> 02:47:26.172]  Find out more at InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:47:26.192 --> 02:47:26.232]  888-253-3139.
[02:47:26.272 --> 02:47:26.732]  What's up, Paul?
[02:47:37.349 --> 02:47:37.729]  Oh, you got it.
[02:47:37.749 --> 02:47:47.339]  Go ahead and pop Trans-Texas Corridor up on the screen for folks and I'll... Yeah, that's another story out of... That's Ben Weir.
[02:47:47.499 --> 02:47:49.301]  That's out of the Austin American Statesman.
[02:47:49.321 --> 02:47:50.082]  That's what I thought it was.
[02:47:51.003 --> 02:47:53.405]  I've got KVUE.
[02:47:54.026 --> 02:47:58.070]  That's the local ABC News affiliate as well with a similar headline.
[02:47:58.110 --> 02:48:00.372]  Trans-Texas Corridor is dead, TxDOT says.
[02:48:01.613 --> 02:48:12.699]  They told us two years ago that the toll roads were dead and the legislature passed a law saying they couldn't seize the roads and basically for one penny on the dollar or less give them to a foreign Spanish company.
[02:48:14.180 --> 02:48:27.848]  The media responded by saying okay the toll roads are all dead as they put them in and opened them and Rick Perry said I'm just ignoring all that and they said they're no longer toll roads these are not toll roads these are pay-as-you-go lanes.
[02:48:29.505 --> 02:48:39.507]  It's like Obama's Chief of Staff saying, well, you're going to have to serve in a new domestic military, 18 to 24, for basic training and then we'll keep you longer if we want.
[02:48:40.007 --> 02:48:40.907]  You must do it under law.
[02:48:40.927 --> 02:48:42.388]  And they go, well, this is then mandatory.
[02:48:42.448 --> 02:48:44.408]  No, it's not mandatory, it's compulsory.
[02:48:45.208 --> 02:48:46.669]  Mandatory and compulsory mean the same thing.
[02:48:48.529 --> 02:48:48.909]  Look them up.
[02:48:49.589 --> 02:48:52.330]  It's like saying, we don't want global government, we want global governance.
[02:48:53.090 --> 02:48:55.350]  Governance means the system of government.
[02:48:55.730 --> 02:48:56.771]  I mean, this is a joke.
[02:48:56.811 --> 02:48:57.391]  It's like saying,
[02:49:02.045 --> 02:49:07.068]  You know, look, the sky is blue, and you say, no, that's not a sky, that's an atmosphere.
[02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.949]  Same thing.
[02:49:09.130 --> 02:49:10.070]  It's a game.
[02:49:10.851 --> 02:49:11.812]  It's a word play.
[02:49:13.533 --> 02:49:16.014]  That's like saying, that's a fire hydrant.
[02:49:16.034 --> 02:49:18.096]  Somebody goes, no, that's a fire plug.
[02:49:19.448 --> 02:49:19.748]  Whatever.
[02:49:20.469 --> 02:49:21.571]  Trans-Texas Corridor is dead.
[02:49:21.631 --> 02:49:22.993]  This is absolutely not true.
[02:49:23.574 --> 02:49:27.519]  The national news, I've seen in clips in Fox saying Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist.
[02:49:27.860 --> 02:49:28.901]  Ron Paul is insane.
[02:49:29.182 --> 02:49:31.245]  The official documents say it's part of the Napa Superhighway.
[02:49:31.505 --> 02:49:32.526]  They say, hey, it doesn't exist.
[02:49:34.161 --> 02:49:37.064]  But here it is, they're playing possum, and that at least means they're in a lot of trouble.
[02:49:37.084 --> 02:49:39.786]  And they're trying to get everybody to kind of go home and shut up.
[02:49:40.387 --> 02:49:54.040]  The Texas Department of Transportation announced, this is truly a federal office, this morning, that it has officially killed the transit corridor, saying that despite the project's visionary aspects, like stealing land 10 miles on every side of the roads, that's only one leg of it, it was 8,000 miles.
[02:49:54.721 --> 02:49:57.604]  It is clearly not the choice of Texans.
[02:49:58.919 --> 02:50:00.321]  What is that little lying statement?
[02:50:00.681 --> 02:50:02.383]  They've had Houston Chronicle polls and others, 99%.
[02:50:04.004 --> 02:50:04.765]  Lou Dobbs had one, 99%.
[02:50:05.846 --> 02:50:08.109]  They've had sign of it polls, 99% are against it.
[02:50:08.589 --> 02:50:09.290]  But what are these guys?
[02:50:09.310 --> 02:50:10.471]  They're all lies!
[02:50:12.053 --> 02:50:20.122]  The Texas Department of Transportation announced this morning, has officially killed the Trans-Texas Corridor, saying that despite the project's visionary aspects, it's clearly not the choice of Texans.
[02:50:23.191 --> 02:50:25.392]  I guess that is true, I was reading that wrong, that they're admitting.
[02:50:25.412 --> 02:50:27.032]  Oh wow, something actually truthful, I couldn't believe it.
[02:50:27.353 --> 02:50:28.653]  They're saying it's not the choice of Texans.
[02:50:29.173 --> 02:50:30.174]  DMN file.
[02:50:30.474 --> 02:50:46.300]  The announcement comes six years after Rick Perry shook up the state's transportation and political circles by unveiling an ambitious plan to stretch highway rail lines and utilities for hundreds of miles, that's 8,000, along Interstate 35 and Interstate 69 corridors, which is part of the Napa Superhighway corridors, 34 of them.
[02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:51.582]  The plan, which would cost tens of millions of dollars and relied heavily on private toll roads, was hugely controversial.
[02:50:52.458 --> 02:50:58.883]  Amando Saniz, Executive Director of TxDOT, made the announcement that the agency was giving up on the idea of the annual transportation forum in Austin.
[02:50:59.224 --> 02:51:02.827]  Make no mistake, the transit corridor, as we have known it, no longer exists.
[02:51:02.887 --> 02:51:03.307]  There it is.
[02:51:03.687 --> 02:51:04.308]  Lawyers speak.
[02:51:04.388 --> 02:51:05.989]  As we have known it.
[02:51:06.590 --> 02:51:07.030]  Right there.
[02:51:08.451 --> 02:51:10.213]  As we have known it.
[02:51:11.554 --> 02:51:12.115]  It's not.
[02:51:12.295 --> 02:51:12.795]  It's back.
[02:51:13.115 --> 02:51:14.677]  It's always going to be there, these bastards.
[02:51:16.698 --> 02:51:17.098]  I think so.
[02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:35.320]  I think so.
[02:52:05.160 --> 02:52:08.122]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[02:52:08.382 --> 02:52:10.723]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[02:52:10.903 --> 02:52:15.926]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[02:52:16.566 --> 02:52:19.087]  Terror Storm, a history of government sponsored terror.
[02:52:19.427 --> 02:52:20.708]  Loose change, final cut.
[02:52:20.988 --> 02:52:22.969]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:52:23.129 --> 02:52:24.770]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:52:25.011 --> 02:52:25.671]  We're good to go.
[02:52:50.800 --> 02:52:51.381]  I think so.
[02:53:15.874 --> 02:53:21.582]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-C.
[02:53:21.742 --> 02:53:31.596]  The original Can-C eyedrop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing and slowing the occurrence of senile cataracts.
[02:53:31.716 --> 02:53:36.079]  Kansi can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[02:53:36.199 --> 02:53:43.163]  Kansi is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders, combat eye strain, kidneys, computer vision syndrome, and more.
[02:53:43.303 --> 02:53:49.087]  People enjoying the benefits while using Kansi report no side effects and the drops are gentle and don't cause eye burning.
[02:53:49.167 --> 02:53:57.074]  With regular use, people using CAN-C drops report a difference in their vision in as little as 30 days, and some have their cataracts completely disappear within months.
[02:53:57.314 --> 02:54:15.170]  CAN-C, that's CAN dash letter C, is available now by calling 888-212-8871, that's 888-212-8871, or order online at Nutrimedical.com, that's N-U-T-R-I-Medical.com, your source for the most powerful nutraceuticals and wellness protocols from a doctor you can trust.
[02:54:22.051 --> 02:54:28.954]  I want to finish up with some final news and tell you about some of the big guests we've got coming up this week.
[02:54:34.957 --> 02:54:39.078]  But before I do that, I want to tell you about one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.
[02:54:39.639 --> 02:54:41.759]  Survivalofseeds.com.
[02:54:42.540 --> 02:54:46.842]  Grow your own healthy food for just four pennies a pound and break free of the new world order.
[02:54:47.442 --> 02:54:49.403]  This family business buys in massive books.
[02:54:50.143 --> 02:54:55.646]  in massive bulk and passes those huge discounts on to the listeners.
[02:54:56.246 --> 02:54:57.207]  They buy in massive bulk.
[02:54:57.247 --> 02:54:57.827]  It is a great deal.
[02:54:57.887 --> 02:54:58.628]  I've gotten some from them.
[02:54:59.628 --> 02:55:05.111]  15,000 heirloom seeds will provide your family with seven years of healthy food.
[02:55:05.131 --> 02:55:07.272]  Stop buying and eating the New World Order food.
[02:55:07.392 --> 02:55:10.114]  Grow your own healthy food in your own backyard.
[02:55:10.154 --> 02:55:13.616]  That's 15,000 heirloom seeds for $129.
[02:55:13.676 --> 02:55:17.598]  That's real food insurance for the difficult times we are about to experience.
[02:55:18.118 --> 02:55:21.121]  Heirloom seeds are the original varieties, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[02:55:21.481 --> 02:55:23.263]  All their seeds date back over a century.
[02:55:23.944 --> 02:55:26.146]  Their Mayflower bean came over on the Mayflower ship.
[02:55:26.306 --> 02:55:36.857]  Now survivalistseeds.com wants you to become one of their heirloom seed farmers and sell them back to your safe seeds years after year because demand is skyrocketing for the rare heirloom seeds.

[02:55:39.459 --> 02:55:40.601]  It's all about self-sufficiency.
[02:55:41.181 --> 02:55:46.567]  You also get a DVD teaching you how to sell your vegetable produce to restaurants, delis, and the farmers markets.
[02:55:46.988 --> 02:55:48.690]  Slaves Hesitate, Patriots Take Action.
[02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:51.373]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[02:55:51.413 --> 02:55:53.536]  SurvivalistSeeds, one word, dot com.
[02:55:54.906 --> 02:55:58.548]  We've got David Icke coming up for two hours on Thursday.
[02:55:58.568 --> 02:56:01.310]  We've got Alan Watt for two hours, one of those are popular guests.
[02:56:01.330 --> 02:56:04.753]  I always enjoy talking to him, riveting insightful information and analysis.
[02:56:05.433 --> 02:56:09.336]  We've got a lot of other very interesting and informative guests coming up this week as well.
[02:56:09.376 --> 02:56:10.777]  Jason Burmese is going to be here in town.
[02:56:11.077 --> 02:56:12.738]  He'll be sitting in some next week as well.
[02:56:14.259 --> 02:56:17.141]  And so I look forward to that.
[02:56:17.761 --> 02:56:19.863]  And I'm doing a new thing where I have a little pocket recorder.
[02:56:20.646 --> 02:56:21.287]  Got to get a new one, though.
[02:56:21.307 --> 02:56:24.790]  Turns out it's not compatible with our computers to dump it off.
[02:56:24.950 --> 02:56:28.153]  Late at night when I'm kind of in a calm, reflective mode, I'm going to start doing recordings.
[02:56:28.393 --> 02:56:28.994]  We're up in the game.
[02:56:29.014 --> 02:56:29.655]  We're doing even more.
[02:56:29.675 --> 02:56:33.758]  I'm putting that up on InfoWars.com and that's going to be up in the next few hours as well.
[02:56:33.818 --> 02:56:38.763]  So definitely go check out the first time that we're launching that.
[02:56:39.624 --> 02:56:42.587]  And all I can say is that I am very, very
[02:56:44.388 --> 02:56:51.110]  I'm proud of the crew, the Genesis Network, the InfoWars Network, everything that we are doing here.
[02:56:52.987 --> 02:57:00.971]  And we reach more people when you spread the word about the show, the free podcast, the free downloads, the streams, your local A.M.
[02:57:00.991 --> 02:57:01.231]  and F.M.
[02:57:01.271 --> 02:57:03.232]  affiliates that a lot of you are tuning into.
[02:57:03.332 --> 02:57:05.213]  That's how we move the ball on the field.
[02:57:05.653 --> 02:57:06.733]  That's how we inform people.
[02:57:06.773 --> 02:57:09.294]  The solution is an awakening to what's happening.
[02:57:09.615 --> 02:57:12.396]  Then the globalists can't misdirect us and control us.
[02:57:12.436 --> 02:57:15.637]  Now, after four hours my voice starts getting tired.
[02:57:16.958 --> 02:57:21.460]  Trans-Texas Corridor is dead, TxDOT says, but then the director of TxDOT,
[02:57:22.887 --> 02:57:29.894]  Amandio Cinez, Executive Director, says, make no mistake, the Transitions Corridor, as we have known it, no longer exists.
[02:57:29.954 --> 02:57:30.114]  See?
[02:57:30.775 --> 02:57:31.555]  As we have known it.
[02:57:31.976 --> 02:57:34.298]  Just like they said, we're not doing toll roads anymore, and then they did them.
[02:57:35.559 --> 02:57:39.403]  They want you to all just drop your baseball bats, your mitts, leave the game.
[02:57:39.743 --> 02:57:40.424]  Oh, the game's over?
[02:57:40.464 --> 02:57:41.024]  Oh, you didn't hear?
[02:57:41.044 --> 02:57:42.626]  You know, the meeting was canceled.
[02:57:42.666 --> 02:57:43.887]  Local governments always try this.
[02:57:44.107 --> 02:57:47.891]  They know a public's coming in to protest something, they say, oh, we changed the meeting, and they go ahead and have the meeting.
[02:57:49.491 --> 02:57:57.894]  Each of the dozens of projects that were linked together under the rubric of the TTC included the Loop 9 project in Dallas will remain as stand-alone projects, he said.
[02:57:59.015 --> 02:58:00.055]  So, did you hear that?
[02:58:00.075 --> 02:58:02.616]  Before I even read the article on air, I said, this is all bull.
[02:58:02.996 --> 02:58:03.777]  You just handed it to me.
[02:58:05.317 --> 02:58:06.938]  Just knocked my mic off to stand there.
[02:58:06.978 --> 02:58:09.119]  I'm kind of out of control here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:09.379 --> 02:58:17.342]  And it says, each of the dozens of projects that were linked together under the rubric of TTC, including the Loop 9 project in Dallas and I-69 project in the South, will remain as stand-alone projects, he said.
[02:58:18.649 --> 02:58:22.174]  And he goes on to say it's been diminished, but we recognize the inevitability.
[02:58:22.534 --> 02:58:24.817]  The TCC is not the choice of Texans.
[02:58:25.138 --> 02:58:27.121]  So they're saying, we're going to do them all standalone.
[02:58:27.661 --> 02:58:31.707]  They're going to do them all separately, so it's harder to coordinate against it.
[02:58:32.668 --> 02:58:33.770]  Compartmentalization.
[02:58:35.826 --> 02:58:36.587]  Oh my goodness.
[02:58:37.047 --> 02:58:38.248]  It's just so incredible.
[02:58:38.849 --> 02:58:39.489]  Get the word out.
[02:58:39.529 --> 02:58:41.431]  This is a fraud, a lie, a scam.
[02:58:41.451 --> 02:58:44.053]  Continue fighting all of these individual projects.
[02:58:44.794 --> 02:58:47.095]  We had a bunch of key guests up today.
[02:58:47.456 --> 02:58:53.401]  Rebroadcast with Mike Rivero, Edwin Vieira, Michael Chossudovsky.
[02:58:53.441 --> 02:58:54.902]  It's all coming up one place.

[02:58:56.683 --> 02:58:58.225]  We'll be back in one minute.
