[00:00:02.074 --> 00:00:02.695]  Big Brother.
[00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:04.436]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:05.156 --> 00:00:06.257]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:06.917 --> 00:00:07.738]  You want answers?
[00:00:08.498 --> 00:00:09.359]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.642]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:18.345]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:29.393]  I think I combed my hair before I went on TV.
[00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:32.403]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:34.564]  We're doing the last hour and 52 minutes.
[00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:38.227]  Simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:51.578]  Coming up in 50 minutes we have trends forecaster Gerald Cilente to break down the latest developments in society and the economy and where he sees Obama going now that his approval rating is the lowest in U.S.
[00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:55.661]  history in the last hundred years since they've been having scientific polling.
[00:00:56.182 --> 00:00:57.943]  He's now beating the previous
[00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.797]  Number one loser, Jimmy Carter, has the fastest drop.
[00:01:04.378 --> 00:01:07.443]  He's gone from the mid-80s down to the low 50s.
[00:01:07.643 --> 00:01:10.508]  And in some polls, he's below 50.
[00:01:11.832 --> 00:01:14.914]  Will Barack Obama stage terror attacks?
[00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:16.735]  That is the question.
[00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:18.616]  I want to play this one more time.
[00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:20.657]  Michael Savage getting it right.
[00:01:20.857 --> 00:01:39.068]  There's several of these clips where he's going on the radio and explaining that Barack Obama may stage terror attacks in the United States, or a bio-attack and say it's natural, or a bio-attack and say that it's man-made, or launch a new war, or further implode the economy.
[00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:42.636]  Then I have another clip coming up.
[00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:48.721]  Fox News Dr. Mark Siegel on rationing care saying it is a form of eugenics.
[00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.162]  Which it is!
[00:01:51.138 --> 00:01:54.941]  And that dovetails with the White House Science Czar.
[00:01:55.882 --> 00:02:10.495]  The White House Science Czar writing an 1100 page textbook for government adoption, calling for world government, CPS taking everyone's children at birth, forced inoculations with sterilization compounds, drugging of the food and water supply.
[00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:18.602]  So it's now in AP, New York Post, Fox News reporting on all of that.
[00:02:20.168 --> 00:02:26.571]  We also have, again, that USA Today article, Polls Can Affect Presidents' Hold on Party.
[00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:30.413]  And then if you look at the actual poll that they have a copy of.
[00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.094]  In fact, let's pull that up from USA Today.
[00:02:32.114 --> 00:02:38.877]  I want to put on screen, not just the article, but the poll that was on the page that came with this.
[00:02:39.037 --> 00:02:40.118]  Drudge was linked to it yesterday.
[00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:42.159]  I know I asked my webmasters to link to it.
[00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.360]  I don't know if they did, at infowarriors.com and prisonbonnet.com.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.901]  I didn't see it, but that doesn't mean it wasn't there.
[00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:57.371]  And you can see the Gallup poll for itself as he is now falling faster and has already fallen further than Jimmy Carter.
[00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:00.751]  So that is coming up as well today.
[00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.432]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[00:03:03.932 --> 00:03:06.072]  Let's talk to George in Texas.
[00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:07.072]  George, you're on the air.
[00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:07.513]  Go ahead.
[00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:09.013]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:09.773]  Good.
[00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:15.574]  You know, the thing is, I'm sitting there, you know, last weekend, you know, I was kind of like humble, but I was kind of like
[00:03:16.064 --> 00:03:26.692]  I felt joyful, not to say I'm celebrating anybody's death, but at the same time, Walter Cronkite had his passing, also Alan Stang, and you got two different people.
[00:03:27.493 --> 00:03:39.562]  Alan Stang gave up a lot to warn us of the New World Order, yet Walter Cronkite became the high priestess at Bohemian Grove and got all this notoriety and fame and sold his soul to the devil.
[00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:41.664]  Yeah, I forgot that part.
[00:03:41.724 --> 00:03:43.986]  He has, according to the annals, the Bohemian Grove.
[00:03:44.943 --> 00:03:47.545]  That I actually wasn't here in the office.
[00:03:47.605 --> 00:03:48.065]  Oh, here it is.
[00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:58.213]  According to this annal, this is the internal annals of the Bohemian Grove, sent to me by one of the widows of one of these guys.
[00:03:59.314 --> 00:04:00.595]  I didn't know what a rare book it was.
[00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:03.077]  This goes for over a thousand bucks on eBay, one of these.
[00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:06.940]  Volume 8, Volume 7, 1987 to 1996, 10-year volume.
[00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.843]  Weaving Spiders coming on here and it says Walter Cronkite is the high priest here.
[00:04:16.463 --> 00:04:23.609]  But I guess he's not the high priest this year, while the Christian conservative leaders meet and have homosexual sex and worship Satan.
[00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.832]  And hey, that's their business if they want to do that, it's just they're not very Christian.
[00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:32.117]  But anyways, pretty interesting.
[00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:32.637]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:04:33.538 --> 00:04:38.202]  Yes, and also like Alan Stang, I know he was on your show, he was a guest on your show, but
[00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:41.278]  I know he passed away, and I looked at a lot of his work.
[00:04:41.338 --> 00:04:49.002]  He could have been very easily sold out, went along, played along, became big as Dan Rather, but I'm glad he took the path he took.
[00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:49.942]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:04:50.042 --> 00:05:00.447]  I have him in the stack, and I was digging around at the first of the show, because I had like three stacks and couldn't find it, or I was going to eulogize him at the beginning of the show.
[00:05:02.748 --> 00:05:04.549]  Tell folks about Alan Stang that don't know.
[00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.710]  I mean, he worked with Edward R. Murrow, didn't he?
[00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:10.780]  Yeah, I heard Mike Wallace.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.941]  I think he worked with both of them.
[00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:14.581]  Both of them came from the same outfit.
[00:05:15.322 --> 00:05:24.325]  But the thing is, history is going to probably exalt Alan Stang for his work, but I think history is also going to vilify Walter Cronkite.
[00:05:25.223 --> 00:05:32.848]  Can you imagine all these big Republican billionaires and corporate CEOs dressing up like women and doing stuff in the woods together?
[00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:34.949]  I mean, it's just... Look at that one!
[00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:38.231]  That's who wants your guns right there, so they can have their way with it.
[00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:40.572]  And then look at these guys, they're really good at it.
[00:05:41.593 --> 00:05:43.354]  And I mean, I'm not even against gay people.
[00:05:43.754 --> 00:05:47.757]  But if these Republicans, you know, want to be gay, that's their business.
[00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:52.820]  The problem is, is that they want to set up their police state and their new order system, but just look at these guys.
[00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.381]  I mean, zoom back in on that for folks at presentplanet.tv.
[00:06:00.063 --> 00:06:02.764]  I mean, that is really, really, really upsetting.
[00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:05.346]  Can you imagine getting in bed with one of those people?
[00:06:06.226 --> 00:06:09.588]  I mean, God Almighty, that sounds like hell right there!
[00:06:09.608 --> 00:06:12.070]  But that was heaven to Walter Cronkite.
[00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.151]  I hear you, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.105]  If I have to, I'll reprint the, it was on News With Views.
[00:06:18.626 --> 00:06:20.588]  Again, I told my webmasters to link to it this morning.
[00:06:20.608 --> 00:06:21.348]  I don't know if they did.
[00:06:21.368 --> 00:06:23.690]  DBKid's article about him.
[00:06:27.634 --> 00:06:32.458]  Just, that, that looks like hell to me, but according to Walter Cronkite, that was a little piece of heaven.
[00:06:32.478 --> 00:06:35.220]  I mean, old men dressed up like women?
[00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:38.864]  My God, that sounds about as disgusting as it gets.
[00:06:40.854 --> 00:06:42.035]  I mean, I don't get these guys.
[00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:45.056]  Even if they like men, what is it about they like old men?
[00:06:46.957 --> 00:06:51.299]  Call it bigoted, I just don't find men attractive, and I don't find old men attractive especially.
[00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:57.561]  There's a bunch of them dressed up like women in here.
[00:06:58.022 --> 00:06:59.422]  And it's not just dressed up like women.
[00:06:59.462 --> 00:07:01.143]  I mean, they get real serious.
[00:07:01.523 --> 00:07:04.404]  Like, here's a photo of the cremation of care they took.
[00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:06.385]  You'd say, oh, that's just stylized.
[00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:09.847]  No, the whole thing's occultic, and they take it very, very serious.
[00:07:11.052 --> 00:07:12.233]  And I guess there's the high priest.
[00:07:12.273 --> 00:07:14.034]  I guess that's Walter Cronkite right there.
[00:07:15.655 --> 00:07:17.216]  They burned the effigy of the child.
[00:07:19.077 --> 00:07:26.402]  Here we got... Here we got Mr. CIA, William F. Buckley, the fake conservative.
[00:07:28.423 --> 00:07:31.585]  Here we've got... I'm gonna find a Walter Cronkite in here in a minute.
[00:07:36.128 --> 00:07:37.209]  I mean, here's another one of them.
[00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:38.770]  I mean, look at this guy.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.240]  It caught in the dark with him.
[00:07:43.321 --> 00:07:45.022]  That's the heir to the Reynolds fortune.
[00:07:47.922 --> 00:07:49.883]  I mean, they're all a bunch of fairies, folks.
[00:07:50.723 --> 00:07:51.684]  Just look at them all.
[00:07:52.464 --> 00:07:53.204]  I'm a fairy.
[00:07:53.984 --> 00:07:54.925]  I'm a eugenicist.
[00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.106]  He's like, yeah, I may be a fairy, but I'm putting fluoride in your water, pal.
[00:08:00.326 --> 00:08:02.147]  You're not laughing at the fairy now, are you?
[00:08:07.929 --> 00:08:09.149]  I'm going to find it here in a moment.
[00:08:14.156 --> 00:08:14.996]  Oh, I'll never find it.
[00:08:15.016 --> 00:08:19.318]  Guys, look in the bibliography in the back and help me find Walter Cronkite.
[00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:25.280]  Oh God, here's more of them dressed up like women.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.660]  Talk about nightmarish.
[00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:31.642]  I mean, that has got to be the most nightmarish thing ever.
[00:08:31.962 --> 00:08:35.523]  Here's somebody dressed up like death who brings the body of the baby over to burn it.
[00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:39.804]  Next to some other creature.
[00:08:41.005 --> 00:08:41.665]  So there you have it.
[00:08:42.864 --> 00:08:46.525]  Here's all the old men and their leather on their motorcycles.
[00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:49.146]  They like buzzing into San Francisco to enjoy themselves.
[00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:50.606]  According to Richard Nixon.
[00:08:51.587 --> 00:08:52.567]  That's what Nixon said.
[00:08:52.607 --> 00:08:57.408]  When am I going to... Somewhere in here I'm going to find... There's Bob Hope.
[00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.110]  We're going to find... Oh, there's Newt Gingrich and Bush Sr.
[00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.971]  Let's give folks some video of them.
[00:09:07.534 --> 00:09:10.295]  They always said don't call him Junior, but in this he's called Junior.
[00:09:10.995 --> 00:09:12.135]  We're next to Newt Gingrich.
[00:09:12.915 --> 00:09:15.656]  They're not in drag there, they haven't gotten dressed yet for the evening.
[00:09:17.196 --> 00:09:24.338]  Nothing creepier than old weirdo rich men dressed up like women, nailing around, chasing young prostitutes in the forest at night.
[00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:27.798]  It's so incredible.
[00:09:29.479 --> 00:09:33.360]  Yeah, find me Walter Cronkite.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.720]  I know he's in there.
[00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.469]  Okay, enough about Walter Cronkite.
[00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:39.550]  Enough about Walter Cronkite.
[00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.111]  Here's some more about Walter Cronkite.
[00:09:41.511 --> 00:09:43.212]  Here he is at the right hand of Satan.
[00:09:46.374 --> 00:09:47.375]  Walter Cronkite.
[00:09:48.795 --> 00:09:49.456]  Our good friend.
[00:09:49.536 --> 00:09:50.156]  Here he is.
[00:09:50.196 --> 00:09:53.658]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:04.945]  Let us hear the peal of a new international liberty bell that calls us over to the creation of a system of enforceable world law.
[00:10:05.846 --> 00:10:11.568]  Thank you.
[00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:25.872]  We would like to bring you a message from the First Lady of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:10:28.047 --> 00:10:31.270]  Attempt to achieve world order before that time must be the work of the devil.
[00:10:59.224 --> 00:10:59.985]  Well, join me.
[00:11:00.445 --> 00:11:03.106]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[00:11:05.348 --> 00:11:21.077]  Let us hear the peal of a new international liberty bell that calls us over to the creation of a system of enforceable world law in which the universal desire for peace can place its hopes and its prayers.
[00:11:23.118 --> 00:11:23.498]  Thank you.
[00:11:24.038 --> 00:11:26.540]  And now for Hillary Clinton for World Government.
[00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:35.413]  We would like to bring you a message from the First Lady of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:36.153]  Ah!
[00:11:37.314 --> 00:11:39.334]  Good evening and congratulations, Walter.
[00:11:39.794 --> 00:11:41.595]  I'm receiving the World Federalist Association's Global Partnership Award.
[00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:42.475]  Good evening, Walter.
[00:11:42.515 --> 00:11:43.576]  You're now in the world.
[00:11:44.196 --> 00:11:47.537]  For more than a generation in America, they welcome the news.
[00:11:47.617 --> 00:11:50.598]  Ladies and gentlemen, more of your calls and a ton of news.
[00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:51.759]  Stay with us.
[00:11:57.489 --> 00:11:59.250]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.232]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[00:12:02.492 --> 00:12:04.413]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[00:12:04.713 --> 00:12:05.494]  Here's the story.
[00:12:05.694 --> 00:12:10.297]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[00:12:10.497 --> 00:12:11.518]  Now here's the bad news.
[00:12:11.758 --> 00:12:16.601]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:18.682]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[00:12:18.942 --> 00:12:23.163]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:28.745]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[00:12:29.065 --> 00:12:30.905]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[00:12:31.245 --> 00:12:39.948]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[00:12:40.268 --> 00:12:45.151]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:49.353]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[00:12:49.553 --> 00:12:52.334]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:12:57.438 --> 00:13:01.083]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:13:01.503 --> 00:13:06.930]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:08.472]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:12.557]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:13:13.198 --> 00:13:26.523]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:13:27.003 --> 00:13:32.305]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:13:32.606 --> 00:13:38.488]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:42.209]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:13:42.229 --> 00:13:42.769]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:44.690]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.770]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:57.265 --> 00:14:02.570]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:10.096]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:14:10.677 --> 00:14:16.822]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:14:17.242 --> 00:14:19.083]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:14:19.223 --> 00:14:21.644]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:14:21.724 --> 00:14:32.669]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:34.590]  It's not about left or right.
[00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.371]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:14:36.831 --> 00:14:43.054]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:14:43.729 --> 00:14:51.492]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:51.993 --> 00:14:53.133]  The Obama Deception.
[00:14:53.573 --> 00:14:54.814]  The people strike back.
[00:14:56.615 --> 00:15:03.117]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes.com, the makers of the highest quality vault doors and safes available.
[00:15:03.618 --> 00:15:06.279]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[00:15:06.619 --> 00:15:11.421]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[00:15:11.761 --> 00:15:11.981]  I think so.
[00:15:34.711 --> 00:15:38.775]  Graph Undersafes are fire and burglar resistant, and they even come with a lifetime warranty.

[00:15:47.564 --> 00:15:49.125]  Or click on their banner at infowars.com today.
[00:16:14.735 --> 00:16:17.416]  But here's Richard Nixon, Art Linkletter.
[00:16:17.436 --> 00:16:18.916]  I wonder if Art Linkletter is still alive.
[00:16:19.737 --> 00:16:22.437]  And then, right next to him, Walter Cronkite.
[00:16:22.517 --> 00:16:26.098]  You know what's weird?
[00:16:26.439 --> 00:16:28.779]  I showed this book about a week and a half ago on TV.
[00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:31.960]  And showed the Richard Nixon and said, oh, there's Walter Cronkite.
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.900]  And then, boom, he's dead.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.801]  There's Gerald Ford beneath him.
[00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:38.540]  There's Richard Nixon.
[00:16:43.642 --> 00:16:46.543]  Here's the guys swimming around enjoying themselves.
[00:16:50.544 --> 00:16:52.505]  CPS gives them endless supply.
[00:16:52.525 --> 00:16:57.686]  Oh, I can't look at any more of this.
[00:16:57.867 --> 00:17:00.728]  It was Mayor Willie Brown who got the warning not to fly on 9-11.
[00:17:02.328 --> 00:17:04.629]  Because he's a good friend, I guess, who can be trusted.
[00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:07.648]  Alright, I'm done looking at this.
[00:17:07.688 --> 00:17:07.988]  We're done.
[00:17:08.648 --> 00:17:14.912]  Got a lot of other news I want to get to before Gerald Cilente joins us next hour on a host of key issues.
[00:17:15.392 --> 00:17:17.453]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[00:17:18.394 --> 00:17:20.955]  If I talk to George or Steve, who's up next, or is it Justin?
[00:17:23.396 --> 00:17:24.557]  Steve in Texas, go ahead.
[00:17:25.998 --> 00:17:26.778]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:29.100]  Hi.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.761]  Thank you for all your good work.
[00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:33.142]  Thank you for calling.
[00:17:34.446 --> 00:17:41.449]  I would just like to say what I was going to say, and if I may, may I comment on one of the previous callers about Rush Limbaugh?
[00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:44.130]  Brother, we didn't screen your call, did we?
[00:17:45.031 --> 00:17:45.171]  No.
[00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:47.091]  Did we ask your name?
[00:17:47.131 --> 00:17:47.892]  You can say your name.
[00:17:48.032 --> 00:17:49.593]  Pompernickel from Possumville.
[00:17:49.973 --> 00:17:51.533]  You are on the air, uncensored.
[00:17:51.573 --> 00:17:51.974]  Go ahead.
[00:17:52.874 --> 00:17:53.074]  Okay.
[00:17:53.494 --> 00:17:56.836]  It makes me really sick about the media, how they portray the 9-11 truthers.
[00:17:58.416 --> 00:18:11.560]  Because instead of showing your documentaries like Terror Storm or the 9-11 Chronicles, all they do is they just show when the 9-11 truthers are protesting and when they're just chanting 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:17.602]  And they never show you or Luke Rudofsky talk about, you know, all the facts and everything.
[00:18:17.902 --> 00:18:22.844]  Well, they do that, but also the History Channel lied and said it wasn't a hit piece.
[00:18:22.924 --> 00:18:26.445]  And then we have this UT conference room
[00:18:27.503 --> 00:18:29.844]  You know, that held about 400 people full of folks.
[00:18:30.304 --> 00:18:37.487]  They would wait till the hour recess and shoot video of the empty bleachers, or like one guy sitting there eating a sandwich.
[00:18:37.928 --> 00:18:42.750]  And they would cut from me giving a speech to empty bleachers to make it look like nobody was there to hear me.
[00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.351]  They would blow my face up, stretch the video, make it look yellow.
[00:18:46.832 --> 00:18:49.213]  And when they showed the real yellow journalist,
[00:18:50.013 --> 00:19:00.962]  For Popular Mechanics, Hearst Publishing was glistening stainless steel, perfect camera, you know, color, everything tuned perfectly, and they would say expert beneath them, but...
[00:19:02.165 --> 00:19:03.906]  The good news is that crap doesn't work.
[00:19:03.926 --> 00:19:09.009]  I mean, we have Gary Hart writing public letters saying Dick Cheney may stage terror attacks.
[00:19:09.989 --> 00:19:11.730]  We have generals quitting saying it.
[00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:17.934]  We have Michael Savage saying Obama may stage terror attacks or will stage terror attacks.
[00:19:17.974 --> 00:19:21.075]  I mean, we've won the war for hearts and minds.
[00:19:21.155 --> 00:19:23.197]  People know government stages terror.
[00:19:24.397 --> 00:19:27.259]  It's in the Army Field Manual, 2004, how to train, how to stage terror.
[00:19:29.657 --> 00:19:34.379]  And so people now, every time there's a terror attack, look at who stands to gain from it.
[00:19:34.939 --> 00:19:38.641]  And so, let the New York Times and Wall Street Journal play their games.
[00:19:38.841 --> 00:19:40.301]  We play ours with the truth.
[00:19:40.662 --> 00:19:42.963]  They've got flimsy lies they're fighting us with.
[00:19:43.403 --> 00:19:55.608]  And they may be able to have a big tsunami of mainstream media power to try to slap us down, but the establishment is so discredited now,
[00:19:56.678 --> 00:20:00.460]  That basically anything and everything they say, people don't believe.
[00:20:01.581 --> 00:20:04.803]  And so, they've completely blown their credibility.
[00:20:05.403 --> 00:20:07.704]  So let them make up whatever delusional crap they want.
[00:20:07.744 --> 00:20:08.925]  I mean, I'm not buying it.
[00:20:08.945 --> 00:20:09.265]  Are you?
[00:20:13.507 --> 00:20:14.468]  Good to hear from you.
[00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:15.428]  Appreciate the call.
[00:20:15.949 --> 00:20:16.989]  Appreciate the call, Steve.
[00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:18.250]  Justin in North Carolina.
[00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:19.551]  Justin, you're on the air.
[00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:22.271]  Hey Alex, two quick things.
[00:20:22.612 --> 00:20:32.774]  I have a little internet radio show and Jack McClam, I know you've interviewed him before, was on my show about two weeks ago and he was giving a dire warning of the 27th and 31st as well.
[00:20:32.794 --> 00:20:35.675]  I know you had a caller that brought it up not too long ago.
[00:20:36.195 --> 00:20:44.637]  So this is something that he said his sources inside the military and his ex-police contacts were telling him that this was something that they were worried about.
[00:20:44.717 --> 00:20:49.899]  So I think everybody that listens to your show that is involved in this movement should take this very serious.
[00:20:50.509 --> 00:21:08.294]  Well, by exposing that they do tend to launch terror attacks during their drills as a cover story in case any of their assets get caught by other sectors of the government that aren't involved in the attacks, if the compartmentalization membrane is broken, a lot of times by exposing these events it stops them from doing it.
[00:21:09.194 --> 00:21:11.055]  And I like Jack and I appreciate him, but
[00:21:13.143 --> 00:21:15.624]  I don't like putting dates on things unless I'm totally sure.
[00:21:15.645 --> 00:21:21.368]  You know, even when I got on air and said, call the White House, tell them don't blow up the World Trade Center, and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[00:21:22.248 --> 00:21:23.989]  Even when I did that, I didn't really give a date.
[00:21:24.009 --> 00:21:25.030]  I said, the next two months.
[00:21:27.852 --> 00:21:28.312]  I understand.
[00:21:28.732 --> 00:21:33.635]  Another thing I wanted to ask you, too, while I got you on air, I want to try to get you on record, Alex, and ask you a question.
[00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:41.302]  I've got a lot of friends inside this movement, and they seem to think that if something happens like a major false flag, they're going to take all their cues from you.
[00:21:41.322 --> 00:21:43.963]  I just wanted to ask you, are you prepared?
[00:21:43.983 --> 00:21:44.884]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:21:44.904 --> 00:21:46.184]  We've got to finish up after the break.
[00:21:47.505 --> 00:21:48.425]  We're on the march.
[00:21:48.886 --> 00:21:50.486]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:51.427 --> 00:21:54.108]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:56.735 --> 00:21:57.836]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:58.116 --> 00:21:59.898]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:22:00.098 --> 00:22:00.759]  Well, you should.
[00:22:01.079 --> 00:22:05.344]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:22:05.584 --> 00:22:06.064]  That's right.
[00:22:06.385 --> 00:22:14.833]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:22:15.053 --> 00:22:16.295]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:22:16.415 --> 00:22:17.556]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:22:17.756 --> 00:22:23.381]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:22:23.721 --> 00:22:30.246]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:22:30.627 --> 00:22:35.831]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:37.292]  This is real.
[00:22:37.612 --> 00:22:38.313]  Don't miss out.
[00:22:38.653 --> 00:22:47.022]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[00:22:47.222 --> 00:22:49.404]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:22:49.584 --> 00:22:53.108]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:56.191]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:22:56.972 --> 00:23:01.957]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:23:02.177 --> 00:23:05.981]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:23:06.201 --> 00:23:11.806]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:23:12.107 --> 00:23:16.971]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:23:17.171 --> 00:23:17.632]  Number three,
[00:23:18.072 --> 00:23:23.519]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.024]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:23:27.284 --> 00:23:31.490]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.415]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:23:35.635 --> 00:23:41.141]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:23:41.362 --> 00:23:45.927]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:23:46.067 --> 00:23:47.609]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:23:56.937 --> 00:23:58.498]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:23:58.618 --> 00:24:03.200]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.102]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:24:06.322 --> 00:24:09.344]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:24:09.364 --> 00:24:15.207]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:24:15.447 --> 00:24:18.389]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:25.575]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:24:25.675 --> 00:24:28.818]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:24:28.958 --> 00:24:30.499]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:24:34.102 --> 00:24:40.165]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:24:40.365 --> 00:24:43.666]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:24:43.686 --> 00:24:44.807]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:24:44.827 --> 00:24:45.367]  Take action today.
[00:24:45.387 --> 00:24:46.767]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.932]  I think so.
[00:25:06.594 --> 00:25:12.058]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[00:25:12.078 --> 00:25:17.242]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[00:25:17.522 --> 00:25:20.024]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[00:25:20.244 --> 00:25:22.686]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:25:22.926 --> 00:25:27.950]  We fired once more and they began to running on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:25:30.828 --> 00:25:31.709]  Steve in Texas?
[00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:33.150]  Or I was already talking to Ronnie.
[00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:34.090]  Ronnie in Texas.
[00:25:34.331 --> 00:25:35.531]  And now we're talking to Justin.
[00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:02.102]  I need to get a new call list.
[00:26:02.122 --> 00:26:03.062]  These all get mixed up.
[00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:06.144]  Justin, Steve, Ronnie, Travis, Chris, and others.
[00:26:06.765 --> 00:26:08.586]  We're talking to Justin in North Carolina.
[00:26:09.126 --> 00:26:11.668]  Okay, Justin, we got interrupted by the break there.
[00:26:11.708 --> 00:26:12.568]  Go ahead and make your point.
[00:26:13.729 --> 00:26:24.596]  Yeah, Alex, what I was saying was, like, you've got Gerald Cemente coming up here in a few minutes, and he's got a YouTube video that he just recently did where he said that there would be a revolution in America.
[00:26:24.616 --> 00:26:26.097]  Now, he's a trends forecaster.
[00:26:26.117 --> 00:26:27.238]  We take our cues from him.
[00:26:28.226 --> 00:26:40.655]  Pretty accurate in the past, so this is a man who knows what he's talking about, but to wrap it all up in the one word... Well, sure, and the establishment has said that they're setting up a police state, knowing what they were going to do would cause a revolution.
[00:26:40.736 --> 00:26:46.420]  So, yeah, I mean, Gerald Solente's a smart guy, but he's basically saying he's predicting the sun will come up in the morning.
[00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:55.747]  Well, yeah, but what I wanted to ask you was, I mean, I listen to your show, and I know your stance, and I know your position... Sure, go ahead and ask the question.
[00:26:57.148 --> 00:27:01.651]  Well, if push comes to shove, are you willing to lead this group of merry men and patriots?
[00:27:01.851 --> 00:27:03.472]  Or, you know, how's it going to go down?
[00:27:03.492 --> 00:27:05.954]  Because a lot of people are taking their cues from you.
[00:27:05.994 --> 00:27:12.218]  So, I think we've just dug into the trenches and gotten ready for the idea that sooner or later we're going to have to fight, and we're looking for a leader.
[00:27:12.419 --> 00:27:14.660]  So, will it be you or will it be someone else?
[00:27:16.562 --> 00:27:22.586]  Well, I think the leader is going to be every individual out there, and I appreciate your call.
[00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:27.234]  You know, there's different types of people in this world.
[00:27:29.796 --> 00:27:38.885]  And there's a type I see a lot who always plan for what's going to come instead of dealing with what's happening now.
[00:27:39.506 --> 00:27:42.629]  Now I deal with the past, I deal with the present, I deal with the future.
[00:27:45.311 --> 00:27:47.814]  And so I don't know what the globalists are going to do.
[00:27:49.184 --> 00:27:51.585]  I don't know what ace is up their sleeve.
[00:27:51.745 --> 00:27:53.786]  I know what group of aces are up their sleeve.
[00:27:53.806 --> 00:27:55.227]  I don't know which card they're going to play.
[00:27:55.927 --> 00:28:02.611]  So I try to prepare people for different eventualities, different scenarios that can unfold.
[00:28:02.831 --> 00:28:07.013]  And a lot of people I talk to say, I'm just buying guns and food and ammo for 10 years.
[00:28:07.553 --> 00:28:14.617]  I'm not going to go to city council or county commissioners or the state house or talk radio or access TV or the gun shows.
[00:28:14.777 --> 00:28:16.118]  I'm not going to warn anybody.
[00:28:17.771 --> 00:28:19.651]  I'm not going to go speak up at my church.
[00:28:21.172 --> 00:28:22.172]  I'm not going to get involved.
[00:28:22.212 --> 00:28:24.312]  I'm just going to wait for war to start.
[00:28:26.453 --> 00:28:29.674]  And then I'm going to go out and basically blast police and military.
[00:28:31.314 --> 00:28:33.834]  Or I'm going to shoot whoever comes to my house to get my guns.
[00:28:34.715 --> 00:28:38.335]  They're just going to turn the food and water off for six months and let your neighbors burn you out.
[00:28:39.216 --> 00:28:40.316]  If they go to that scenario.
[00:28:41.596 --> 00:28:44.677]  I mean, in a situation of warfare, 90% of it is propaganda.
[00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:47.507]  They call it info war.
[00:28:48.788 --> 00:28:50.428]  Black propaganda, which is lies.
[00:28:50.548 --> 00:28:51.748]  White propaganda that's truth.
[00:28:51.908 --> 00:28:53.169]  We use white propaganda.
[00:28:53.189 --> 00:28:57.010]  Their favorite is black propaganda or kind of a gray propaganda that's a twisting of it.
[00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:00.991]  That's what makes our information so much stronger.
[00:29:01.051 --> 00:29:01.731]  It's historical.
[00:29:01.791 --> 00:29:02.331]  It's factual.
[00:29:02.371 --> 00:29:03.191]  It's based on reality.
[00:29:03.591 --> 00:29:05.012]  They lie and get caught lying.
[00:29:05.052 --> 00:29:09.193]  We tell the truth and get verified over time so our credibility goes up and up and up.
[00:29:09.573 --> 00:29:13.554]  Even if our delivery sometimes is pretty haphazard and obnoxious, it's real.
[00:29:16.107 --> 00:29:17.148]  People resonate with that.
[00:29:17.708 --> 00:29:19.189]  We got guts and guts is enough.
[00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:31.656]  But if I tried to make myself a leader, and if I tried to say I'm your president or I'm your colonial leader, number one, it would look ridiculous to the general public, as it would be.
[00:29:32.817 --> 00:29:44.544]  And number two, it would make me a major target and then would weaken the whole movement because it would be a unified, vertically integrated, top-down power structure.
[00:29:46.636 --> 00:29:48.977]  That's why having too many eggs in the Ron Paul basket.
[00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:55.099]  I've said support him, he's a great focal point, but they can demonize him, they can marginalize him, and he'll get old.
[00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:57.020]  It's got to be about the information.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.201]  Ron Paul has said that over and over and over again.
[00:30:01.021 --> 00:30:03.742]  Anytime you try to compliment him, he explains, no, no, it's the idea.
[00:30:04.162 --> 00:30:06.183]  I'm just a focus of this, one of the focuses.
[00:30:08.463 --> 00:30:15.706]  So, because of the nature of our society,
[00:30:16.738 --> 00:30:17.978]  And what's going on in it?
[00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:21.159]  Now is the critical time to speak out.
[00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:23.200]  Now is the critical time to be involved.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:37.443]  Now is the time to be reaching out to people in any and every way we can, because as the police state cracks down, as the restrictions on free speech cracks down, it's going to be harder and harder.
[00:30:37.763 --> 00:30:41.084]  Why are they cracking down on freedom of assembly and freedom of the press and all this?
[00:30:41.444 --> 00:30:42.924]  Because it's hurting them!
[00:30:43.484 --> 00:30:45.885]  They don't like it because they're vulnerable!
[00:30:46.914 --> 00:30:59.150]  So instead of just wearing camo and wearing black bandanas and hiding out in the woods and having people salute you as the captain and militias struggling over the power structure and you know I watched the Republic of Texas
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:17.711]  And not all of them, there were four or five different factions, but mainly it was people in trailers being saluted by their nephews and nieces, and they had admirals with pontoon boats, and if you owned a firearm you were a general, and they would wear military outfits and looking like clowns.
[00:31:18.251 --> 00:31:21.933]  And I know a lot of them must have been feds, because I saw their interactions with police.
[00:31:21.973 --> 00:31:27.376]  They were meant, down the road the globalists saw Texas sovereignty or secession as a threat.
[00:31:27.737 --> 00:31:29.638]  It was meant to archetype it as a clown.
[00:31:33.111 --> 00:31:35.398]  And this is what they do.
[00:31:37.697 --> 00:31:54.065]  And so instead of talking about who the leader is, and talking about the organizations we're going to build, and having committees and meetings, and you know, there's so many groups that just have committee meetings and groups, and they make you honorary members, and they call you and say, do you want to make decisions?
[00:31:54.105 --> 00:31:54.645]  Do you want to be in?
[00:31:54.765 --> 00:32:05.170]  I'm too busy manning the guns in the Infowar, and trying to wake up as many people as I can, do as many radio interviews as I can do, as many news articles, as many films,
[00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:13.555]  And I'm just here trying to say, wake up the next person, discredit the system, expose false flag terror, expose the globalists.
[00:32:16.637 --> 00:32:19.179]  So somebody asked me, are you going to lead us?
[00:32:19.379 --> 00:32:20.519]  I am already leading.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.241]  There's a reason I'm leading people.
[00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:28.865]  There's a reason I'm the most hardcore, the most effective, the most focused.
[00:32:28.905 --> 00:32:30.306]  And that doesn't mean I'm doing a perfect job.
[00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.291]  It's because I will put the hours in.
[00:32:33.412 --> 00:32:34.272]  I will do the job.
[00:32:34.392 --> 00:32:35.453]  I will do the radio shows.
[00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:36.394]  I will make the films.
[00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:37.655]  I will write the books.
[00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:38.776]  I will interview the guests.
[00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:44.621]  I will take action and then my listeners are taking action and they're leaders.
[00:32:45.802 --> 00:32:52.148]  And so, I believe at a county and city and state and regional level, there are leaders out there.
[00:32:52.528 --> 00:32:55.411]  And they're going to be state representatives and they're going to be congressmen and women.
[00:32:57.412 --> 00:32:59.274]  And they are there.
[00:33:01.574 --> 00:33:10.558]  And many governors have risen, like Eliot Spitzer was going to expose the banks and he had one skeleton in his closet and they blew him away.
[00:33:12.279 --> 00:33:15.501]  And this other governor was starting to fight the New World Order.
[00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:21.503]  He'd been to Bilderberg, but he had rejected them according to what he said and thinks they were a bunch of old clowns.
[00:33:21.523 --> 00:33:22.564]  They didn't like that, by the way.
[00:33:22.584 --> 00:33:28.787]  I'm not saying he's perfect, but he had some skeletons cheating on his wife and they're destroying him.
[00:33:30.453 --> 00:33:36.080]  And Palin isn't perfect, she's got her own problems, but they're going to destroy her because she's calling for state sovereignty.
[00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:41.107]  And Democrats, like Spitzer, they destroyed him.
[00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:48.076]  And Blagojevich, as bad as he was, they destroyed him because
[00:33:50.103 --> 00:33:51.724]  He kicked Bank of America out!
[00:33:51.744 --> 00:33:56.867]  There was a great article written over the weekend at InfoWars.com by one of our op-ed writers, one of our volunteer writers.
[00:33:56.888 --> 00:33:59.149]  You can write your own stories and if they're good, we'll post them.
[00:33:59.509 --> 00:34:01.090]  Writers at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:04.152]  And it was a great article about how they're going after governors.
[00:34:06.794 --> 00:34:10.757]  Something like anti-New World Order governors beware or something.
[00:34:10.777 --> 00:34:12.338]  I forget the exact headline.
[00:34:13.959 --> 00:34:16.020]  Maybe we can put that up on screen for people.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.502]  But when somebody says, are you going to lead us?
[00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:48.364]  It's easy from your house to have 10 or 15 sycophants show up and call you the Master and Commander, or the Captain, or the Leader, or the Provincial Leader, or the Continental Congress Secretary, or... What do they call Oliver Cromwell?
[00:34:48.404 --> 00:34:49.445]  What was his name?
[00:34:53.115 --> 00:34:53.756]  I gotta know that.
[00:34:54.176 --> 00:34:55.878]  Wikipedia Oliver Cromwell.
[00:34:56.639 --> 00:35:00.523]  It's like a splinter in my mind not being able to remember.
[00:35:00.903 --> 00:35:01.564]  Here, I'll look it up.
[00:35:01.684 --> 00:35:02.565]  Oliver Cromwell.
[00:35:02.585 --> 00:35:03.506]  Then we'll go back to calls.
[00:35:05.768 --> 00:35:09.352]  Oliver Cromwell.
[00:35:12.875 --> 00:35:13.896]  What was his term?
[00:35:13.916 --> 00:35:14.877]  What was his name?
[00:35:17.094 --> 00:35:20.155]  You know, Wikipedia has been exposed as a CIA front for a reason.
[00:35:20.555 --> 00:35:23.276]  It's always the first thing that comes up, and it's riddled with disinfo.
[00:35:23.836 --> 00:35:28.218]  But see, I already have historical background knowledge, so I'll, this is just to refresh my memory.
[00:35:28.258 --> 00:35:29.558]  I'll know if this is accurate or not.
[00:35:31.419 --> 00:35:35.180]  What was his... No, his name was not Ironsides.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:42.103]  It was, uh... No, it was like Grand Protector, Defender of the Faith.
[00:35:44.543 --> 00:35:46.304]  Oh, this is driving me absolutely crazy.
[00:35:50.362 --> 00:35:56.105]  No, it's not Ironside, so... Exactly, that's why Wikipedia is an absolute joke if it says that.
[00:35:56.825 --> 00:35:58.886]  Okay, let's just go ahead and go back to calls.
[00:35:58.906 --> 00:36:00.647]  I'm not going to sit there and obsess over all that.
[00:36:02.828 --> 00:36:08.872]  Let's talk to... Let's talk to Steve in Texas.
[00:36:08.892 --> 00:36:09.712]  Steve, you're on the air.
[00:36:10.933 --> 00:36:12.453]  Yeah, hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:36:13.374 --> 00:36:17.396]  First of all, Cromwell's title was Lord Protector and Defender of the Faith.
[00:36:17.796 --> 00:36:18.216]  That's it.
[00:36:18.356 --> 00:36:19.157]  Lord Protector.
[00:36:20.034 --> 00:36:23.537]  Yeah, unlike a lot of Americans, but like you, I read.
[00:36:23.557 --> 00:36:26.139]  And I'm a student of history.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.582]  And before I get to what I called, I've got a direct quote.
[00:36:29.622 --> 00:36:32.105]  The other night, I just happened to pull up on Google.
[00:36:32.245 --> 00:36:34.186]  I hadn't seen this movie in a long time.
[00:36:34.687 --> 00:36:39.171]  And of course, you know, HG Wells was a big globalist and a eugenicist.
[00:36:40.472 --> 00:36:46.819]  And there's a movie I saw on TV several times when I was a kid and I happened to pull it up because I wanted to watch it on Google.
[00:36:46.839 --> 00:36:48.161]  It's called The Time Machine.
[00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:53.407]  And I want to give you a direct quote from that movie that just blew me away when I heard it.
[00:36:53.427 --> 00:36:55.549]  Well, it's based on H.G.
[00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:58.673]  Wells' The Time Machine, the top eugenicist.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.800]  Right.
[00:37:00.601 --> 00:37:04.663]  And this is the 1960 movie, not the two remakes after that.
[00:37:05.404 --> 00:37:13.949]  But before I give you this quote, I just want to say in response to a few callers earlier where he was basically, you know, trying to nicely criticize you for how you're being.
[00:37:13.969 --> 00:37:16.731]  And I want to say this not because I'm trying to defend you.
[00:37:16.751 --> 00:37:18.352]  You don't need anybody to defend you.
[00:37:19.244 --> 00:37:24.070]  Because you've made it real clear, this whole thing, what you're doing, it's not about Alex Jones.
[00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:29.757]  It's about standing up, just like the Founding Fathers, for what's good and right and true.
[00:37:30.237 --> 00:37:32.200]  I've been a Christian for over 30 years.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:38.668]  I'm convinced of the truth of the Word of God, and so I stand for it, and because of that, I've gotten a lot of opposition.
[00:37:39.248 --> 00:37:49.275]  And I've even had people accuse me, just like you've been, of being mean-spirited and cruel and, you know, not understanding, insensitive, unchristian, etc.
[00:37:49.635 --> 00:37:51.296]  And it's all a bunch of bull.
[00:37:51.316 --> 00:37:53.297]  And this is what I wanted to say to the guy that called in.
[00:37:53.658 --> 00:37:57.240]  For people that just simply can't deal with the truth,
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.621]  I don't know.
[00:38:15.234 --> 00:38:15.334]  Yes.
[00:38:30.725 --> 00:38:32.186]  It's all about world government.
[00:38:32.246 --> 00:38:35.068]  It's all about offshore elites that own both parties.
[00:38:35.348 --> 00:38:42.332]  And it's so illegitimate and criminal that foreign banks have stolen $23.7 trillion in less than 10 months.
[00:38:42.932 --> 00:38:44.533]  And my God, arrest them all!
[00:38:44.593 --> 00:38:46.695]  Instead, they're setting up a police state.
[00:38:46.715 --> 00:38:48.696]  I appreciate your call.
[00:38:49.096 --> 00:38:50.957]  It was good to hear from you, Steve.
[00:38:50.977 --> 00:38:53.439]  We're going to Ronnie, Travis, Chris, Matt, and others.
[00:38:53.719 --> 00:38:55.100]  But I promise to get to this.
[00:38:57.093 --> 00:39:01.415]  This is a video clip from Fox News, Dr. Mark Siegel on rationing care.
[00:39:02.376 --> 00:39:04.457]  In a way it's a form of eugenics, he says.
[00:39:05.057 --> 00:39:08.339]  Well, it's not in a way a form of eugenics, it is eugenics.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.121]  That's what this whole system is!
[00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:19.045]  We have an 1100 page textbook written by the President's Chief Science Advisor, the Science Czar, Holdren.
[00:39:19.746 --> 00:39:25.129]  And the guy he co-authored the textbook with was the Congressional Advisor and the Presidential Advisor to Bush!
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.660]  I mean, these people run things!
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.221]  That's what all this is for!
[00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:32.061]  That's what their own documents say!
[00:39:32.381 --> 00:39:33.961]  It's not my opinion!
[00:39:34.262 --> 00:39:36.962]  People can say, oh, well, that guy's a nut, or that guy yells and screams.
[00:39:37.262 --> 00:39:38.903]  How am I not supposed to yell and scream?
[00:39:40.183 --> 00:39:47.064]  I mean, again, how do you yell and scream about football and baseball and track, and you get so upset if your people don't win?
[00:39:47.424 --> 00:39:52.705]  And I don't say you're bad for getting upset about sports, but this is elites poisoning your water, man!
[00:39:54.386 --> 00:39:55.146]  On record!
[00:39:56.610 --> 00:40:01.834]  A world government with a CPS will take everyone's children at birth and they're setting it up?
[00:40:03.135 --> 00:40:16.846]  And now they want to socialize healthcare so government can control what healthcare you get and hundreds of new taxes and taxes on toilet paper, we gave you the bill number, and taxes on drinks, and taxes on food, and just total control!
[00:40:17.907 --> 00:40:18.988]  It's happening now!
[00:40:20.504 --> 00:40:24.746]  All these top pundits are admitting this is like the Soviet Union, but it's for the bankers.
[00:40:24.786 --> 00:40:25.966]  They're robbing us.
[00:40:26.526 --> 00:40:27.087]  Here's the clip.
[00:40:28.147 --> 00:40:32.349]  Meanwhile, joining us live in the studio, we got Dr. Mark Siegel, Fox News medical contributor.
[00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:43.473]  Doctor, yesterday the Mayo Clinic came out and said this plan of the President's is not good, it's not going to be good for healthcare, and I understand you are quitting the AMA.
[00:40:44.093 --> 00:40:45.453]  I wrote about it in the New York Post today.
[00:40:45.474 --> 00:40:52.096]  I'm quitting the AMA because the AMA does not represent us if they can come out in support of a plan that is going to put doctors under the bus.
[00:40:52.516 --> 00:41:00.779]  First of all, if there's going to end up being rationed care here, which there will be if the government takes over and they make the decisions for us, you know what that's going to do?
[00:41:00.839 --> 00:41:02.500]  That's going to increase my liability.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:08.662]  Not only will I be able to provide the services that I need to provide for my patients, I'm still going to be responsible for it.
[00:41:08.702 --> 00:41:10.602]  Let the government take on the liability.
[00:41:10.662 --> 00:41:11.063]  Stop!
[00:41:11.663 --> 00:41:12.003]  Stop!
[00:41:13.038 --> 00:41:14.539]  It'll be just like vaccine makers.
[00:41:14.999 --> 00:41:16.801]  You'll be given total immunity.
[00:41:17.161 --> 00:41:21.524]  Now you can cut the wrong leg off or let somebody die of staph.
[00:41:22.565 --> 00:41:24.026]  Canada, England, they all come here.
[00:41:24.646 --> 00:41:28.850]  You gotta wait 16, 18 months for a brain surgery that you'll die if you don't get it in three months.
[00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:30.531]  You're above 60, you die.
[00:41:31.131 --> 00:41:32.352]  These are eugenicists.
[00:41:33.173 --> 00:41:35.014]  This is about them having their way with us.
[00:41:35.414 --> 00:41:37.416]  These are the folks that want to force Medicaid our water.
[00:41:38.919 --> 00:41:39.740]  Go ahead and keep planning.
[00:42:00.455 --> 00:42:02.038]  We're going to come back and finish it, back it up.
[00:42:02.058 --> 00:42:02.919]  He's absolutely right.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.328]  They've already under Bush and now Obama federalized the data keeping, the upgrades, the computers.
[00:42:08.749 --> 00:42:11.172]  What procedures you can do if you take Medicare or Medicaid?
[00:42:12.295 --> 00:42:16.058]  That's why Ron Paul and his practice wouldn't take it, because you go under their control.
[00:42:16.418 --> 00:42:33.830]  This forces you to go under it, even if you don't want it, and puts in the system of control, and begins the rationing, where if you're on the government system, they ration you, and then if you make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, they give you a 5.4 surcharge to pay for everybody else's, which will then be eugenics.
[00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:35.831]  So I want you to hear him say eugenics.
[00:42:35.851 --> 00:42:36.771]  I want to get back.
[00:42:36.912 --> 00:42:38.132]  Everything is eugenics.
[00:42:38.592 --> 00:42:45.116]  Eugenics, eugenics, eugenics, eugenics, eugenics, eugenics, eugenics, eugenics, eugenics.
[00:42:45.136 --> 00:42:46.997]  Did I tell you it's all about eugenics?
[00:42:47.037 --> 00:42:49.878]  That world government's all about being able to force eugenics on you?
[00:42:50.419 --> 00:42:52.380]  Because if I don't say it once, I want to say it again.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.101]  It's about eugenics.
[00:42:54.761 --> 00:42:56.762]  World government to carry out eugenics.
[00:42:57.242 --> 00:43:00.204]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:43:00.604 --> 00:43:04.209]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:43:04.509 --> 00:43:07.954]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:43:08.234 --> 00:43:15.503]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[00:43:18.148 --> 00:43:18.408]  I think so.
[00:43:41.463 --> 00:43:44.125]  And ship all orders over $50 free of charge.
[00:43:44.426 --> 00:43:46.748]  Visit BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[00:43:46.968 --> 00:43:49.310]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.932]  Or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:43:52.132 --> 00:43:56.476]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[00:43:57.277 --> 00:43:58.678]  It is a big idea.
[00:43:58.698 --> 00:44:00.800]  A new world order.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:05.924]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:44:06.408 --> 00:44:09.250]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.431]  Put their objective being world domination.
[00:44:12.011 --> 00:44:14.453]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:44:15.193 --> 00:44:22.517]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:44:25.543 --> 00:44:30.486]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:44:30.967 --> 00:44:34.469]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:37.331]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:38.572]  Most people have no idea.
[00:44:38.592 --> 00:44:39.352]  They're not after money.
[00:44:39.372 --> 00:44:40.453]  They have all the money they need.
[00:44:40.653 --> 00:44:41.374]  They're after power.
[00:44:41.634 --> 00:44:42.474]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:44:42.775 --> 00:44:47.318]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:44:47.538 --> 00:44:51.020]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.062]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:44:54.322 --> 00:44:55.383]  You have been warned.
[00:44:56.404 --> 00:44:59.686]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:44:59.846 --> 00:45:03.930]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:15.539]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:45:15.779 --> 00:45:21.604]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:45:21.824 --> 00:45:22.465]  We're good to go.
[00:45:45.274 --> 00:45:45.794]  Ira Hayes
[00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:23.622]  Ira Hayes, call him drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore.
[00:46:24.283 --> 00:46:29.270]  Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian, nor the Marine that went to war.
[00:46:35.945 --> 00:46:41.632]  All right, we got Gerald Cilente right after in the second segment of the next hour, for the balance of that hour.
[00:46:41.872 --> 00:46:48.740]  I want to go to Ronnie, Travis, Chris, Matt, Linda, and a few others before he gets on with us.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.221]  We'll continue with calls as well.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:56.642]  In some of the other news, I already mentioned this, but folks really should go read the story at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:57.023 --> 00:46:59.404]  Cost of bailout hits a whopping $24 trillion, or $23.7 trillion.
[00:46:59.864 --> 00:47:01.124]  Over $80,000 for every American.
[00:47:01.144 --> 00:47:03.305]  Bloomberg, AP, Reuters are all reporting this now.
[00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:12.652]  Watson got this from C-SPAN.
[00:47:12.692 --> 00:47:17.956]  We even have the C-SPAN clips where they bring this up to Bernanke, and he says, yeah, I'm not going to tell you where the money is.
[00:47:18.637 --> 00:47:23.681]  I've got clip after clip after clip of this, but they're all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:24.882 --> 00:47:25.683]  They're all over the web.
[00:47:25.703 --> 00:47:27.124]  We're not going to play them in the interest of time.
[00:47:29.627 --> 00:47:32.009]  But let's finish up this eugenics clip.
[00:47:32.964 --> 00:47:39.671]  You know, they got us fighting over $20, $30, $40, $50 billion a year over some health care for 20% of the public that's not insured.
[00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:44.096]  And of course, the insurance companies are lobbying to make you do this, then they can jack up prices.
[00:47:44.497 --> 00:47:50.323]  This is the beginning of the totally controlled economy, where they control Ford, GM, Chrysler, all the businesses.
[00:47:51.084 --> 00:47:53.847]  Here it is, where they say it's eugenics, which is the truth.
[00:47:55.148 --> 00:47:56.168]  He's disingenuous.
[00:47:56.209 --> 00:47:56.889]  I'll tell you why.
[00:47:57.029 --> 00:47:59.270]  Because I know my own office is going to change.
[00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:00.931]  There's going to be more people trying to get in.
[00:48:01.391 --> 00:48:03.472]  I'm going to have less and less time to take care of them.
[00:48:03.812 --> 00:48:06.353]  Reimbursements to doctors and hospitals are being cut.
[00:48:06.653 --> 00:48:08.855]  If I'm being paid less, I've got to work faster.
[00:48:09.115 --> 00:48:11.676]  That means I send more and more people for expensive tests.
[00:48:12.176 --> 00:48:15.198]  He's going to try to cost cut, which means he's going to ration care.
[00:48:15.498 --> 00:48:18.139]  So he's going to tell me what I can order, what I can't.
[00:48:18.419 --> 00:48:27.284]  And when you talk about rationing, and we were just talking to Dick Morris about this, he's done some research, and when you start rationing healthcare, and it looks as if that couldn't happen.
[00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:34.567]  I mean, if you've got 50 million more people in the system, and a certain number of doctors, people are going to be in line, and you're going to have to determine who gets the next treatment.
[00:48:35.788 --> 00:48:39.010]  Unfairly, the elderly are the ones who are going to get short-changed.
[00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.910]  That's so true.
[00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:41.631]  I mean, in a way, it's a form of eugenics.
[00:48:41.751 --> 00:48:42.952]  Oh, you're not good enough to live.
[00:48:43.032 --> 00:48:48.335]  Now look, Allison made a great point off the air, which is some people we do over-treat at the last days of life.
[00:48:48.615 --> 00:48:50.156]  But who do you want to make that decision?
[00:48:50.176 --> 00:48:54.298]  The art of medicine is the doctor and the patient making it together, not some government bureaucrat.
[00:48:54.318 --> 00:48:54.778]  So that's it, folks.
[00:48:55.338 --> 00:48:55.759]  That's it.
[00:48:57.059 --> 00:49:00.501]  And the elite don't want you to have access to your own medical care.
[00:49:00.541 --> 00:49:03.343]  They love the power that is going to come from the state.
[00:49:04.512 --> 00:49:12.016]  And it is in trouble, but as they bankrupt things and then half the public doesn't have it, then they'll say, oh, we've got to give health care.
[00:49:14.617 --> 00:49:18.619]  And they'll compromise with just taking over part of the system so they can get all of it later.
[00:49:19.199 --> 00:49:20.900]  That's why they're destroying the economy.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:33.866]  I saw a video last night online of Robert Pasture, the big North American union head, who came up with a lot of the system's details, saying out of this crisis, we're going to bring this system in.
[00:49:35.365 --> 00:49:39.153]  So, it is certainly happening, certainly going on.
[00:49:39.593 --> 00:49:42.639]  I'm going to start the next hour, take a few of your calls, and get to Gerald Cilente.
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.326]  Before I end this hour, I do want to encourage listeners...
[00:49:47.267 --> 00:50:00.451]  To get some of the videos and books that we're carrying on eugenics, on vaccines, on forced drugging of in some states 75% of foster children, how it's causing kids to commit suicide.
[00:50:00.791 --> 00:50:06.893]  GenerationRx available at InfoWars.com or you can call toll free to get it 888-253-3139.
[00:50:06.913 --> 00:50:08.654]  Of course the eugenics masterpiece
[00:50:12.355 --> 00:50:15.757]  The overall New World Order plan, the one film everybody's got to see.
[00:50:16.197 --> 00:50:19.518]  This needs to be in everybody's library, shown to friends and family.
[00:50:19.558 --> 00:50:22.079]  Please get Endgame today at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:22.459 --> 00:50:25.961]  You can get this film free when you get it with the Obama Deceptioner Endgame.
[00:50:27.402 --> 00:50:30.403]  Reflections and Warnings with Aaron Russo, our newest work.
[00:50:30.803 --> 00:50:37.146]  And of course Global Warming, Emerging Science and Understanding, great new film by Dr. Michael Kaufman, also available at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:38.939 --> 00:50:40.921]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:44.824]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:46.745 --> 00:50:50.729]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:50:50.989 --> 00:50:52.770]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:50:52.990 --> 00:51:01.277]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:51:01.517 --> 00:51:06.741]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[00:51:07.062 --> 00:51:08.703]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:51:08.923 --> 00:51:15.248]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:51:15.428 --> 00:51:26.195]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:51:26.475 --> 00:51:26.996]  That's right.
[00:51:27.256 --> 00:51:29.537]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:51:29.818 --> 00:51:31.379]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:35.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:06.409 --> 00:52:10.071]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're dropping, dropping the info bomb.
[00:52:10.111 --> 00:52:12.271]  We are now into the fourth hour today.
[00:52:12.712 --> 00:52:15.073]  Top Trends Forecaster, Gerald Cilente, joins us.
[00:52:15.173 --> 00:52:17.333]  It is Wednesday, the 22nd day of July 2009.
[00:52:17.533 --> 00:52:24.256]  Don't forget the free podcast of the radio show available at infowars.com and the listen page.
[00:52:24.576 --> 00:52:31.119]  Listen how you want, where you want, when you want, and please keep spreading the word about how people can listen to the free internet streams.
[00:52:31.499 --> 00:52:32.820]  Let us now go to... Who's up next here, John?
[00:52:55.629 --> 00:52:57.050]  Ronny in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:58.211]  Go ahead, Ronny.
[00:52:59.032 --> 00:52:59.552]  Thank you, sir.
[00:52:59.612 --> 00:53:02.515]  I'd like to thank Gerald Salente for his ideas before you get there.
[00:53:03.316 --> 00:53:05.017]  And I want to thank you for everything.
[00:53:05.057 --> 00:53:10.342]  Of course, you're getting to speak with your guest, Wayne Paul, was a special treat for me, but I forgot.
[00:53:10.362 --> 00:53:18.589]  I forgot to mention that the most important person of that Paul family I spoke to was his granddaughter.
[00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:19.749]  We're good to go.
[00:53:40.174 --> 00:53:41.655]  Him to decide to run again.
[00:53:41.695 --> 00:53:43.716]  That's just maybe a delusion on my part.
[00:53:43.736 --> 00:53:46.098]  You also know Ron Paul's for real.
[00:53:46.178 --> 00:53:55.584]  That's why COINTELPRO attack him and ask where's the campaign money and this and that when it's all under the Federal Election Commission public.
[00:53:55.964 --> 00:53:57.945]  COINTELPRO is now attacking We Are Change.
[00:53:57.985 --> 00:53:59.947]  We Are Change isn't centralized.
[00:54:00.007 --> 00:54:01.348]  It's just a name, an idea.
[00:54:02.088 --> 00:54:06.670]  That I promoted up front and exploded worldwide, because the name was good.
[00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:20.554]  And they're trying to attack the New York chapter because openly on this show, you the listeners, raised money for German Tallis, who they ran the wheelchair into and set up and he was found not guilty.
[00:54:20.934 --> 00:54:22.295]  So they're trying to spend that.
[00:54:23.987 --> 00:54:25.788]  But again, it's not working.
[00:54:26.608 --> 00:54:32.152]  And we're continuing to move forward and expose the New World Order, and the globalists absolutely hate it.
[00:54:32.633 --> 00:54:33.734]  And we're going to bring them to justice.
[00:54:33.754 --> 00:54:36.876]  So they love to nitpick on us all day, but we're not the New World Order.
[00:54:37.336 --> 00:54:43.941]  We're not the New World Order that is forcing you to pay taxes so they can use it to poison your water.
[00:54:45.002 --> 00:54:48.224]  And so the people are wise to that, and we're going to bring down the globalists.
[00:54:49.701 --> 00:54:51.182]  I hear you and I appreciate your call, Ronnie.
[00:54:51.202 --> 00:54:51.662]  I gotta jump there.
[00:54:51.682 --> 00:54:52.523]  Travis in Illinois.
[00:54:52.543 --> 00:54:53.423]  Travis, go ahead.
[00:55:21.775 --> 00:55:22.815]  Yes, go ahead, Travis.
[00:55:24.076 --> 00:55:29.337]  I just wanted to let you know that your Obama Deception is an awesome film.
[00:55:29.477 --> 00:55:33.098]  It's the only reason I know anything about any of this.
[00:55:33.318 --> 00:55:35.279]  It's how I got awakened, as you might say.
[00:55:35.299 --> 00:55:35.639]  Good, good.
[00:55:35.659 --> 00:55:36.519]  So somebody woke you up.
[00:55:36.539 --> 00:55:38.520]  Did you see it on the internet or did somebody give you a DVD?
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:43.921]  Actually, I saw it on the internet while doing an English report on Obama.
[00:55:45.261 --> 00:55:47.462]  My teacher thought I was doing something, yo.
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:49.100]  Because I liked him.
[00:55:50.181 --> 00:55:51.361]  He found that out quickly.
[00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:53.141]  I've been sending links everywhere.
[00:55:53.161 --> 00:55:54.842]  I just have a couple things to say.
[00:56:11.675 --> 00:56:16.320]  You know what the Marisol is in the vaccinations, the mercury-based preservative?
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.022]  I found out it's also in contact solution.
[00:56:19.062 --> 00:56:20.243]  I didn't know if you know that.
[00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:21.264]  Some.
[00:56:21.324 --> 00:56:22.946]  It's been phased out of most, yes.
[00:56:23.746 --> 00:56:26.789]  Well, I know the one I was using did have it in for the longest time.
[00:56:26.829 --> 00:56:27.430]  Bausch & Lohm?
[00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:28.531]  What?
[00:56:29.131 --> 00:56:29.952]  Bausch & Lohm?
[00:56:32.374 --> 00:56:35.497]  I believe it was the Walmart brand at the time was using it, but
[00:56:36.255 --> 00:56:46.226]  I couldn't figure out why my contacts were so, or my eyes were so irritated and I switched to the Walgreens brand which advertised the Marisol Free.
[00:56:46.366 --> 00:56:50.271]  Look, look, I'm going to have to keep you on hold for when we go to calls with Gerald Celente or you can just drop off.
[00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:50.871]  We're out of time.
[00:56:51.192 --> 00:56:51.872]  That's your choice.
[00:56:52.193 --> 00:56:53.614]  We'll be right back with Gerald Celente.
[00:56:54.455 --> 00:56:54.876]  Stay with us.
[00:56:56.854 --> 00:57:02.396]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:57:02.697 --> 00:57:03.857]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:57:04.017 --> 00:57:07.959]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[00:57:08.279 --> 00:57:09.840]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:16.443]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.

[00:57:20.444 --> 00:57:21.925]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:57:22.185 --> 00:57:24.966]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:57:25.206 --> 00:57:26.627]  And their formula really works.
[00:57:26.907 --> 00:57:29.468]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:57:29.728 --> 00:57:30.989]  Try the NutriCafe.
[00:57:31.229 --> 00:57:35.651]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[00:57:35.991 --> 00:57:38.192]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:57:38.412 --> 00:57:40.673]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:57:40.873 --> 00:57:42.614]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:57:42.954 --> 00:57:45.255]  Go to www.innerfood.com
[00:57:45.976 --> 00:57:48.299]  We're good to go.
[00:57:56.892 --> 00:58:01.876]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:58:02.096 --> 00:58:05.898]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:06.119 --> 00:58:11.723]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:12.023 --> 00:58:12.483]  It's true.
[00:58:12.683 --> 00:58:16.886]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:17.086 --> 00:58:17.547]  Number three,
[00:58:18.007 --> 00:58:23.454]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:58:24.295 --> 00:58:26.958]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:58:27.199 --> 00:58:30.623]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:31.724 --> 00:58:35.349]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:58:35.569 --> 00:58:41.055]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:58:41.295 --> 00:58:45.860]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:00:18.021 --> 01:00:22.245]  And he's been making a lot of amazing predictions over the last 20-plus years as a trends forecaster.
[01:00:22.866 --> 01:00:24.828]  Before that, of course, he's also a best-selling author.
[01:00:25.389 --> 01:00:27.951]  Before that, he worked in some of the biggest political campaigns in the country.
[01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:32.175]  He's also one of the main contributors in the film, The Obama Deception.
[01:00:32.215 --> 01:00:34.458]  He's trends forecaster Gerald Solente.
[01:00:34.478 --> 01:00:37.400]  He's also in the new Obama film coming out in October.
[01:00:38.081 --> 01:00:43.487]  This film shows how both parties are controlled by the same interest, this gangster government, this takeover.
[01:00:43.867 --> 01:00:45.629]  We'll be talking to Gerald about that right now.
[01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:50.334]  Please get The Obama Deception at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:00:54.779 --> 01:00:59.962]  And if you can't afford the DVD with the extras and the high quality to show your friends and family and make copies from, that's fine.
[01:01:00.443 --> 01:01:02.004]  Just Google the Obama Deception.
[01:01:02.344 --> 01:01:03.785]  Look for the third or fourth link down.
[01:01:04.145 --> 01:01:06.146]  That's the best version I found on YouTube.
[01:01:06.606 --> 01:01:07.687]  It's a director's channel.
[01:01:07.947 --> 01:01:09.348]  It's got about 3 million views.
[01:01:10.009 --> 01:01:11.910]  All total, it's over 20 million views online.
[01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:14.351]  And pass that link out to everybody.
[01:01:14.611 --> 01:01:18.254]  But again, get this, have this on your shelf, show it to everybody.
[01:01:19.094 --> 01:01:22.156]  People see it and it's like it's pressing it because we show everything he was going to do.
[01:01:22.176 --> 01:01:24.438]  This came out one month into him in office.
[01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.979]  And it's all chronicled in the Obama deception.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.302]  Going now to Gerald Cilente for the next 51 minutes.
[01:01:31.643 --> 01:01:33.604]  We'll take your calls at the bottom of the hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:33.664 --> 01:01:46.653]  Gerald Cilente, you've got the floor, the mainstream media more than ever is taking notice of all the shocking predictions you've made the last three years that are unfortunately
[01:01:47.313 --> 01:01:48.294]  Coming true.
[01:01:48.754 --> 01:01:49.915]  Where is the economy?
[01:01:50.515 --> 01:01:52.036]  You say revolution's coming.
[01:01:52.396 --> 01:01:54.858]  The elite are stealing everything, even nailed down.
[01:01:55.418 --> 01:02:00.941]  Gerald Cilente, chief of the Trends Research Institute, tell us what's happening.
[01:02:02.722 --> 01:02:07.109]  Well, let's just, we only stick by the facts, as you well know, and we're political atheists.
[01:02:07.149 --> 01:02:11.676]  We don't believe in this two-headed, one-party system.
[01:02:12.056 --> 01:02:16.903]  We don't bow to politicians or genuflect at political altars.
[01:02:16.943 --> 01:02:18.185]  We only look at the facts.
[01:02:18.926 --> 01:02:30.558]  We just heard Vice President Biden last week, a week and a half ago, say that no one, the truth is, we and everyone else misread the economy.
[01:02:30.618 --> 01:02:31.459]  That's his quote.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:35.303]  Well, the truth is either he's ignorant and all of those
[01:02:35.883 --> 01:02:50.371]  PhDs and credentialed people in the White House are ignorant, or else they're so arrogant that they can only see outside the beltway, or can't see outside the beltway and think that they're the only people that know anything, or else they're lying to us.
[01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:52.472]  Those are the only three options.
[01:02:52.812 --> 01:02:57.155]  Because the truth is, as you well know, we saw it, and so did some others.
[01:02:58.035 --> 01:03:01.716]  And so all we're doing is we're looking at the facts, Alex.
[01:03:01.776 --> 01:03:14.499]  And the facts are that the Obama administration said that $787 billion bailout scheme was going to create 600,000 new jobs by this time.
[01:03:14.979 --> 01:03:20.401]  And they said that without the stimulus package, we would see unemployment hit 8%.
[01:03:23.455 --> 01:03:25.195]  In 2009, and peak at 9% in 2010.
[01:03:26.456 --> 01:03:29.897]  That's what they said.
[01:03:30.518 --> 01:03:35.040]  Now we have unemployment already, official unemployment, at 9.5%.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.141]  So they're way off on that.
[01:03:38.441 --> 01:03:40.062]  How could they have any credibility?
[01:03:40.362 --> 01:03:45.744]  We've lost 2.5 million jobs since Obama has become president.
[01:03:46.305 --> 01:03:48.886]  And at very best, if you're going to be generous,
[01:03:49.446 --> 01:03:57.073]  They spent 20% of the stimulus package and created, at best, 150,000 new jobs.
[01:03:57.593 --> 01:04:13.327]  So when you extrapolate this forward, the best they can do is come up with about 700-750,000 new jobs over two and a half years, whereby they said they were going to create between 3.5 and 4 million jobs, and to wit,
[01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:22.738]  We've already lost $7.2 million since this recession, quote, officially began.
[01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:30.988]  Gerald, I was looking at a USA Today Finance Gallup poll.
[01:04:32.463 --> 01:04:38.046]  And it showed how Obama got elected at an 83-84, depending on which one of the graphs.
[01:04:38.066 --> 01:04:40.067]  They've had several of these Gallup polls.
[01:04:40.587 --> 01:04:44.149]  And now he's dropped below 50s, but in some demographics below 50.
[01:04:44.449 --> 01:04:56.676]  That is a faster, steeper, further decline than the previous Grand Champion loser, the peanut farmer from Georgia.
[01:04:58.223 --> 01:04:58.383]  I don't
[01:05:13.874 --> 01:05:18.479]  Fastest to fall, but luckily a magic crises popped up.
[01:05:19.481 --> 01:05:33.216]  Nine months in to kind of boost Bush for a while, but minus a stage crises or provocation or war, Obama is a political dead duck and his entire agenda to seize America is failing.
[01:05:34.217 --> 01:05:36.318]  But does he have an ace up his sleeve?
[01:05:36.398 --> 01:05:46.400]  Is it the crisis is going to be so bad we all can only swim to the life raft of the federal government, even if it's a desert island covered with government zombies?
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.421]  Or is it a new war?
[01:05:48.941 --> 01:05:50.621]  Is it a staged terror attack?
[01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:57.803]  I mean, if he's in total freefall, the worst in the last hundred years of polling with presidents, what does this mean?
[01:05:58.585 --> 01:06:16.308]  I think you're one of the most astute people out there talking about this in the way that you're talking about it because we saw the exact same things as well in that when you look at the free fall that he's had in the polls and you compare it as to Carter and then Bush was one percentage point higher, summer came
[01:06:17.249 --> 01:06:18.811]  Uh, Bush was down in the dumps.
[01:06:18.871 --> 01:06:25.139]  People were making fun of him for taking a month-long vacation to Crawford, Texas, as the economy was sinking.
[01:06:25.199 --> 01:06:29.524]  Remember, we were just getting, we were just being hit by the dot-com bubble burst.
[01:06:30.325 --> 01:06:31.667]  And all of a sudden, there was 9-11.
[01:06:33.206 --> 01:06:38.148]  So, these people come up with schemes undreamed of, or things can just happen.
[01:06:38.689 --> 01:06:50.134]  One of the things that we're watching very closely is that the Obama administration is held back in releasing budget projections that were supposed to come out within a week.
[01:06:50.794 --> 01:06:57.097]  And now they're going to come out with them after, after Congress takes its recess in August.
[01:06:57.437 --> 01:06:58.898]  That's a big signal to us.
[01:06:59.798 --> 01:07:05.961]  So we're looking at that very, very closely because there may be the shock of our lifetime in those numbers.
[01:07:06.542 --> 01:07:09.363]  No one's talking anymore about the green shoots.
[01:07:09.764 --> 01:07:13.185]  Remember that load of malarkey that they were spreading around?
[01:07:13.486 --> 01:07:17.108]  That money manure that was supposed to be pushing up the economy?
[01:07:18.008 --> 01:07:20.250]  So that's the kind of thing that we're looking for.
[01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:21.531]  Anything could happen.
[01:07:21.851 --> 01:07:24.513]  They come up with schemes undreamed of.
[01:07:24.994 --> 01:07:34.021]  But the reality is, in the final sense, is that, as we've been saying, the world is going to call it the greatest depression.
[01:07:34.841 --> 01:07:38.364]  In America, it's going to be called Obamageddon.
[01:07:39.136 --> 01:07:49.780]  The schemes that they've come up with, these bailouts, buyouts, rescue packages, us owning corrupt companies like Citigroup and General Motors.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.240]  I love it.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:55.262]  General Motors, they bring back this guy, Lutz, who was the vice chair.
[01:07:56.343 --> 01:08:09.654]  This is a genius, Alex, that came out in 2005, 2006, that said that anyone that thinks that high gasoline prices are going to hurt the sales of SUVs doesn't know what they're talking about.
[01:08:09.914 --> 01:08:12.056]  This is a champion they brought back now.
[01:08:12.076 --> 01:08:15.018]  Look what's going on with the Goldman Sachs gang.
[01:08:15.538 --> 01:08:20.983]  I've said this, and I'll say it again, and I've said it before, and I'll repeat it over and over again.
[01:08:21.663 --> 01:08:23.044]  I'm of Italian descent.
[01:08:23.505 --> 01:08:26.687]  I've heard enough Mafia stories for the rest of my life.
[01:08:27.728 --> 01:08:40.539]  If the names on Wall Street were Solenti, Caruso, Mondavi, Rossini, Puccini, Abatelli, Puccio, they'd call it the Mafia.
[01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:47.944]  Oh, it would be major news every day how the mafia is ripping off the country.
[01:08:47.964 --> 01:08:51.308]  You know, we just gave these guys, what, how many billions of dollars?
[01:08:51.688 --> 01:08:54.191]  And now they're giving it back to themselves in bonuses.
[01:08:54.491 --> 01:08:55.813]  Oh, it would be big story.
[01:08:56.153 --> 01:08:59.617]  But you can't call the White Shoe Boys criminals.
[01:09:00.197 --> 01:09:09.506]  You could call them, you know, these Ponzi schemes they talk about, with credit swap, fault derivatives, and collateral CBOs and SIVs.
[01:09:09.966 --> 01:09:18.994]  How about calling them, rather than exotic financial instruments, how about calling them Pond Games and Ponzi schemes?
[01:09:19.295 --> 01:09:20.296]  And Grand Larceny!
[01:09:20.576 --> 01:09:21.437]  Grand Larceny!
[01:09:22.097 --> 01:09:23.598]  Well, I mean, Gerald Cilente, there you are.
[01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:24.759]  I'm sure you've seen all these clips.
[01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:30.443]  Paulson last week, the congressmen were asking him, where's the $200 million you got personally?
[01:09:30.503 --> 01:09:31.964]  Is that not a conflict of interest?
[01:09:32.745 --> 01:09:35.767]  And how all the regulators were former Goldman Sachs.
[01:09:35.827 --> 01:09:38.289]  And he just said, no, it's no conflict of interest.
[01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:52.237]  We were talking before you came on live about the shockingness of actually watching 23.7 trillion stolen in 10 months greater than the GDP times two.
[01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:55.399]  I mean, I feel like I'm in a dream here, Gerald.
[01:09:55.839 --> 01:10:01.725]  Well, you know, we're writing now, we're writing the Autumn Trends Journal, and this is the way we began it.
[01:10:02.406 --> 01:10:06.250]  And we're writing back from the year 2012, we're looking to 2009.
[01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:11.836]  The greatest crime wave ever to hit America was sweeping across the nation.
[01:10:12.496 --> 01:10:26.853]  More lawless than the Wild West, better organized than Gangland Chicago, a ruthless mob of financial bandits and political wise guys had taken control of the United States of America.
[01:10:27.433 --> 01:10:33.000]  Not a week went by without Wall Street and Washington committing world-class crimes.
[01:10:33.607 --> 01:10:36.728]  It was all carried out under the cover of law.
[01:10:37.268 --> 01:10:44.951]  If perpetrated by individuals, it would have been called robbery, extortion, embezzlement, and fraud.
[01:10:45.351 --> 01:10:49.852]  And the perpetrators would have been indicted, hauled into court, and brought to justice.
[01:10:50.433 --> 01:10:57.215]  But because politicians and financiers were committing the crimes, it was just called legislation.
[01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:02.891]  Unbelievable, and it seems to be a bottomless pit.
[01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:08.656]  I mean, they're seizing the entire economy, manufacturing, the carbon tax.
[01:11:10.037 --> 01:11:10.778]  Where does it end?
[01:11:11.772 --> 01:11:13.552]  Well, here's the way we're looking at it.
[01:11:13.752 --> 01:11:26.195]  As you know, we keep repeating, and it's worth repeating because it doesn't seem to hit a lot of people in the head the right way, is that you can't print phantom money out of thin air back by nothing, producing practically nothing.
[01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:30.856]  We're now looking at the dollar taking another hit against a basket of currencies.
[01:11:31.256 --> 01:11:33.197]  Gold prices are back on the rise.
[01:11:33.697 --> 01:11:36.157]  We heard from China, Russia, India, Brazil.
[01:11:36.698 --> 01:11:38.318]  They all want to bail out of the bucks.
[01:11:39.861 --> 01:11:40.802]  So where is it going?
[01:11:41.282 --> 01:11:43.143]  The decline of Empire America.
[01:11:44.264 --> 01:11:46.425]  Darryl Salente, Trends Research.
[01:11:46.445 --> 01:11:48.006]  We'll give you the website when we get back, listeners.
[01:11:50.148 --> 01:11:53.029]  Will they be able to pump it up one more time, or is this the big one?
[01:11:53.089 --> 01:11:54.290]  Is this the big implosion?
[01:11:54.971 --> 01:11:55.411]  Stay with us.
[01:11:58.137 --> 01:12:08.227]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[01:12:28.729 --> 01:12:29.730]  Garden in a Can.
[01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:31.011]  It's that simple.
[01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:33.213]  Fresh, healthy, easy.

[01:12:57.409 --> 01:12:58.830]  It is a big idea.
[01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:00.951]  A New World Order.
[01:13:01.652 --> 01:13:06.114]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:13:06.154 --> 01:13:09.336]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:13:09.376 --> 01:13:11.597]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:13:12.158 --> 01:13:14.599]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:22.664]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:30.663]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:13:31.124 --> 01:13:34.606]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:13:34.986 --> 01:13:37.488]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:13:37.568 --> 01:13:38.709]  Most people have no idea.
[01:13:38.729 --> 01:13:39.489]  They're not after money.
[01:13:39.509 --> 01:13:40.590]  They have all the money they need.
[01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:41.511]  They're after power.
[01:13:41.771 --> 01:13:42.631]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:13:52.418 --> 01:13:54.099]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:13:54.459 --> 01:13:55.540]  You have been warned.
[01:13:57.321 --> 01:14:01.062]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[01:14:01.802 --> 01:14:04.864]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:07.865]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[01:14:08.405 --> 01:14:14.387]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[01:14:14.988 --> 01:14:16.788]  The only real option is precious metals.
[01:14:17.329 --> 01:14:23.031]  For your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[01:14:24.008 --> 01:14:26.609]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package.
[01:14:27.109 --> 01:14:31.070]  And I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:35.812]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[01:14:36.052 --> 01:14:40.593]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[01:14:41.673 --> 01:14:44.954]  And together we can develop a Make Sense program before the clock runs out.
[01:14:45.575 --> 01:14:50.136]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[01:14:50.256 --> 01:14:52.957]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[01:14:56.309 --> 01:15:03.379]  As you already know, drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:15:03.719 --> 01:15:08.106]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:15:08.386 --> 01:15:13.253]  Alkavision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:15:13.593 --> 01:15:21.058]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:15:21.318 --> 01:15:25.581]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[01:15:25.881 --> 01:15:31.825]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:15:32.085 --> 01:15:37.849]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[01:15:38.069 --> 01:15:43.353]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[01:15:43.633 --> 01:15:47.396]  That's ALKAVISION.COM or by calling 269-216-9767.
[01:15:47.456 --> 01:15:48.276]  That's 269-216-9767 today!
[01:15:48.296 --> 01:15:48.997]  Woah, boom, bop-a-boom!
[01:15:49.017 --> 01:15:50.038]  Woah, boom, bop-a-boom!
[01:15:50.058 --> 01:15:50.298]  Woah, boom!
[01:16:17.097 --> 01:16:31.265]  When you say this is the greatest heist in history, I don't think people understand.
[01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:31.985]  You really mean that.
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:49.942]  23.7 trillion and they're grabbing every sector of the economy and the green tax, the carbon tax allows the bureaucracy.
[01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:52.582]  I have the bill that they passed in secret, now public.
[01:16:52.902 --> 01:16:54.663]  As you know, I want your take on that.
[01:16:55.063 --> 01:17:01.544]  Allows federal agencies to raise taxes on toilet paper, beef, everything.
[01:17:01.604 --> 01:17:04.165]  I mean, this is government becoming God.
[01:17:04.465 --> 01:17:05.845]  You call that fascism, don't you?
[01:17:05.885 --> 01:17:06.165]  Go ahead.
[01:17:06.585 --> 01:17:13.230]  Well, the merger of state and corporate powers, according to Mussolini, is called fascism.
[01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:19.114]  So if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, let's call it a spade a spade.
[01:17:19.174 --> 01:17:20.254]  It's fascism.
[01:17:20.935 --> 01:17:29.501]  And to pick up on the second part of what you were saying, and I was saying, was at first they went through this whole scheme of the money printing.
[01:17:29.521 --> 01:17:34.044]  Well, that's going to run out, as we're seeing now, with the diving of the dollar.
[01:17:34.424 --> 01:17:39.291]  And other countries looking for new reserve currency.
[01:17:39.671 --> 01:17:44.278]  So the next scheme is to tax the people to death.
[01:17:45.139 --> 01:17:49.505]  And whether it's hassle taxes, again, current events form future trends.
[01:17:49.845 --> 01:17:51.668]  Pick up today's USA Today.
[01:17:52.328 --> 01:17:56.711]  Look at the parking ticket numbers that they're putting out there.
[01:17:57.292 --> 01:17:59.733]  If you jaywalk, they'll give you a ticket.
[01:17:59.993 --> 01:18:08.699]  Spit on the street, but rob the country blind, you can get an award for it, or they'll make you a Treasury Secretary.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:16.425]  So the scheme, Alex, is after the printing game runs out, it's the tax-to-death game.
[01:18:17.405 --> 01:18:19.547]  And this whole thing, this whole notion,
[01:18:19.987 --> 01:18:21.829]  Of two big to fail.
[01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:23.471]  Who came up with that one?
[01:18:23.871 --> 01:18:27.775]  I can say with full authority that their mother's not better than mine.
[01:18:28.296 --> 01:18:30.558]  What would happen if they failed?
[01:18:30.938 --> 01:18:32.560]  No one's ever told us.
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:42.590]  But yet we hear from Henry the Don Paulson at the last House Oversight meeting saying, quote, our response
[01:18:43.459 --> 01:18:53.389]  Our responses were not perfect, but I am confident that they were substantially correct, and that they saved this country from great peril.
[01:18:53.589 --> 01:18:55.691]  Well, look at how this psychology works.
[01:18:56.072 --> 01:19:04.180]  They can rape, they can steal, they can steal trillions, they engineered the crisis on record, and then they're the savior, and if you don't give them what they want,
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:08.081]  They'll declare martial law as Paulson threatened last year.
[01:19:08.441 --> 01:19:18.265]  Now there's been articles in the news, as you know, Gerald, saying how good it was he threatened martial law, and how he's above the law, and how the private Federal Reserve is above the law.
[01:19:18.305 --> 01:19:25.588]  You know, the President isn't, the Congress isn't, the courts aren't, but they are, because they're the Eddie Haskell bankers.
[01:19:26.175 --> 01:19:29.896]  And more than that, as I said, they're the Wall Street Mafia.
[01:19:30.377 --> 01:19:32.818]  It's Henry the Don Paulson.
[01:19:33.158 --> 01:19:36.239]  You read the New York Times, he bullied Congress.
[01:19:36.559 --> 01:19:37.679]  Bullied Congress?
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.820]  What do you mean bully?
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.441]  Who is this guy to bully Congress?
[01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:46.623]  Oh, and there's Jamie Legs Diamond from JP Morgan.
[01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:54.466]  And there's, uh, who's that guy from Citigroup that would put this whole grand scheme together.
[01:19:55.186 --> 01:19:57.688]  Sandy, Greedy Pig, Wilde.
[01:19:58.008 --> 01:19:59.929]  Now let's call them who they are.
[01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:02.691]  They're robbing this nation blind.
[01:20:03.111 --> 01:20:15.159]  And the people are either drugged... We have gone from the home of the brave to what's happened to this country.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:23.265]  That we have become so subservient and so federally dictated.
[01:20:24.245 --> 01:20:27.048]  We're free and we're not brave as a nation.
[01:20:27.348 --> 01:20:32.452]  You know, people can make fun of the French all they want, but boy, the French got it down.
[01:20:32.472 --> 01:20:38.658]  Look what happened when that company was trying to shaft the employees out of their severance pay.
[01:20:38.678 --> 01:20:42.802]  You know, they tried to blow the place up and all the equipment did it.
[01:20:43.522 --> 01:20:47.303]  When they do boar snappings, these are the people that brought us off with their heads!
[01:20:47.883 --> 01:20:57.186]  They know what it's like to be living under the tyrannical government, where they say, let them eat bread, now it's give them some healthcare.
[01:20:57.846 --> 01:21:06.369]  Well, on top of this, when you look at the French, when they try to plant GMO crops there, the farmers just burn it down.
[01:21:07.268 --> 01:21:11.490]  And I don't know how Americans were always known as the quickest to stand up to tyranny.
[01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:14.831]  Now we're known worldwide as kind of the suckers.
[01:21:15.251 --> 01:21:16.231]  How did that happen?
[01:21:16.612 --> 01:21:21.994]  Well, I have to say, you know, you are what you eat.
[01:21:22.314 --> 01:21:25.815]  And look what this country leads, and look what they look like, and look what they've become.
[01:21:27.896 --> 01:21:29.296]  Yeah, we just became decadent.
[01:21:29.376 --> 01:21:31.917]  We're the great-grandchildren of really hard-working people.
[01:21:32.618 --> 01:21:34.738]  And we've become a bunch of slobs, myself included.
[01:21:34.758 --> 01:21:35.919]  We've got to get our dignity back.
[01:21:37.341 --> 01:21:38.242]  Not be so cowed.
[01:21:38.302 --> 01:21:43.688]  Gerald, I want to take calls and get into where you see all this going, how you see the revolution breaking out, and a lot more.
[01:21:43.708 --> 01:21:46.631]  The website is TrendsResearch.com.
[01:21:46.912 --> 01:21:47.552]  TrendsResearch.com.
[01:21:47.572 --> 01:21:48.293]  We're on the march.
[01:21:48.794 --> 01:21:50.376]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:50.396 --> 01:21:54.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:56.766 --> 01:21:57.867]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:21:58.147 --> 01:21:59.928]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:00.828]  Well, you should.
[01:22:01.128 --> 01:22:05.370]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:06.110]  That's right.

[01:22:17.796 --> 01:22:23.418]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:22:23.759 --> 01:22:30.301]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:22:30.662 --> 01:22:35.844]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[01:22:58.758 --> 01:23:03.385]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:23:03.505 --> 01:23:06.269]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:23:06.469 --> 01:23:09.333]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:23:09.533 --> 01:23:14.240]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.401]  If you simply prepare.
[01:23:15.581 --> 01:23:18.523]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:23:18.823 --> 01:23:25.729]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:23:52.985 --> 01:23:54.766]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:23:57.079 --> 01:23:59.801]  Do you know that you can be tracked and traced when you're online?

[01:24:20.077 --> 01:24:20.417]  We're good.
[01:24:43.131 --> 01:24:43.351]  We're good.
[01:25:10.663 --> 01:25:14.846]  Gerald Salente is our guest, and in just three short minutes, we're going right back to him.
[01:25:14.906 --> 01:25:33.277]  But, during the break, the last break, before last, about ten minutes ago, I called Ted up, the owner of Genesis and Miner's Resources, and I said, do you have any of that gold and silver left from when gold was 900 bucks an ounce?
[01:25:35.007 --> 01:25:41.852]  And when silver was a dollar less, and he said, yes, we're almost out of it, but we have the very tail end, so this is the last.
[01:25:42.352 --> 01:25:55.381]  Gold up over 40 plus dollars from that point, silver way up, and this is the very end of the Lakotas, the Franks, the Sovereigns, and some other coins Ted Anderson has right now until midnight tonight.
[01:25:56.282 --> 01:25:58.023]  Ted, that's as long as you can hold it, correct?
[01:25:58.283 --> 01:26:01.967]  Well, I mean, the price on the internet has already gone up.
[01:26:02.027 --> 01:26:08.655]  If you go to our web offers, you'll find that the Lakotas are in the $19 range, where these are still sitting at that $18.17.
[01:26:11.539 --> 01:26:13.260]  So yeah, that is a really good buy.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:22.704]  The reason why I was able to put them up there is I had about 900 of them left in my inventory, although some of those are spoken for already, but I haven't received the checks from people.
[01:26:23.124 --> 01:26:26.786]  But I will hold it at that price, but then come tomorrow, it's like $19.17.
[01:26:26.826 --> 01:26:28.347]  I can't remember exactly what the number was.
[01:26:31.548 --> 01:26:33.389]  Okay, so the Lakotas are going up.
[01:26:33.469 --> 01:26:37.132]  What about gold at the lower price when you bought it at $900, $905?
[01:26:38.152 --> 01:26:42.275]  Well, that is obviously just a steal if I ever heard of one.
[01:26:42.315 --> 01:26:47.539]  I mean, you have still right now the Franks sitting at $216 a coin.
[01:26:47.959 --> 01:26:49.200]  The British Sovereign is at $266.
[01:26:50.821 --> 01:26:52.642]  Both of those coins have gone up in price.
[01:26:53.062 --> 01:26:55.444]  I don't put them on our internet site, but they all are
[01:26:56.384 --> 01:27:02.489]  Up in price because of the fact that gold was trading at $9.13 when I locked him in at this level.
[01:27:02.569 --> 01:27:06.892]  Currently right now, today's spot price of gold, the last time I've looked, was $9.5160.
[01:27:06.932 --> 01:27:08.293]  It's been as high as $9.50 net $5.90 already today.
[01:27:12.196 --> 01:27:12.917]  So yeah, there's...
[01:27:27.551 --> 01:27:29.393]  You're selling out of these stores you have.
[01:27:29.413 --> 01:27:30.273]  You're almost out.
[01:27:30.594 --> 01:27:34.857]  Instead of raising your prices when gold and silver goes up, that's how you should make a profit.
[01:27:34.897 --> 01:27:36.018]  You know, we're capitalists.
[01:27:36.038 --> 01:27:37.159]  We're not communists.
[01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:41.603]  You're passing those savings on, but this is the end.
[01:27:41.663 --> 01:27:43.545]  This is the last time, Ted, correct?
[01:27:43.685 --> 01:27:44.545]  It is the end of this.
[01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:51.892]  I can tell you right now, Alex, I placed an order today for 5,000 more Lakotas, and the price is much higher than what I'm offering right now.
[01:27:51.972 --> 01:27:53.173]  So I can't do that.
[01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:54.796]  And is this the end for the gold?
[01:27:55.177 --> 01:27:56.259]  Is this the end for the gold?
[01:27:56.439 --> 01:27:59.365]  The gold is still... They're both the same thing.
[01:27:59.405 --> 01:28:00.147]  I mean, the gold is...
[01:28:01.019 --> 01:28:03.160]  I mean, I'm lucky to be able to carry it through midnight.
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:06.202]  I will, just because I'll lose some money on some of the deals.
[01:28:06.742 --> 01:28:08.563]  Okay, so you're almost completely out.
[01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:08.643]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:28:08.663 --> 01:28:08.723]  800-686-2237.
[01:28:08.743 --> 01:28:08.783]  800-686-2237.
[01:28:08.803 --> 01:28:10.644]  The brokers will be there until midnight tonight.
[01:28:10.704 --> 01:28:11.504]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:28:11.544 --> 01:28:11.744]  Call today.
[01:28:11.764 --> 01:28:11.824]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:28:25.171 --> 01:28:25.571]  Absolutely.
[01:28:25.591 --> 01:28:27.453]  Just leave a message on the voice recorder.
[01:28:27.553 --> 01:28:28.973]  We're going to honor everybody.
[01:28:42.322 --> 01:28:45.606]  All right, 800-686-2237.
[01:28:45.626 --> 01:28:47.488]  You can't get this deal at MyDailyRehearsals.com.
[01:28:47.728 --> 01:28:50.872]  You've got to call and say it's the Alex Jones, Ted Anderson, radio special, 800-686-2237.
[01:28:50.972 --> 01:28:51.953]  Ted, thank you so much.
[01:28:51.973 --> 01:28:53.795]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:28:57.659 --> 01:28:57.979]  You bet.
[01:28:58.299 --> 01:29:01.060]  Going back to Gerald Salinto, I appreciate holding the website again.
[01:29:02.401 --> 01:29:09.843]  We'll put up on screen for you right now for folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, TrendsResearch.com.
[01:29:10.163 --> 01:29:12.404]  Gerald, I'm just going to throw this at you in the cold.
[01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.645]  I don't even know what your view is on this particularly.
[01:29:14.965 --> 01:29:19.786]  What do you think of people getting out of paper and moving partially into silver or gold?
[01:29:19.946 --> 01:29:21.847]  Is that generally a smart idea?
[01:29:22.731 --> 01:29:29.177]  Well, we don't give investment advice, but I can tell you that I'm 80% invested in gold, and I keep buying it.
[01:29:30.117 --> 01:29:35.122]  And my strategy, by the way, is that I also hedge my currencies in the sense that
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:38.241]  I'll own dollars, but I'll also own euros.
[01:29:38.361 --> 01:29:39.962]  One goes up, the other goes down.
[01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:44.324]  I just want parity to keep what I have.
[01:29:44.604 --> 01:29:46.405]  This is about wealth preservation.
[01:29:46.945 --> 01:29:49.186]  And to us, gold is the wild card.
[01:29:49.606 --> 01:29:53.548]  But having said that, as you may or may not know, in our December 2001,
[01:29:57.199 --> 01:30:06.535]  We had said that gold prices had bottomed, and we've been bullish on gold since, and we're predicting in our forecast of gold 2000.
[01:30:08.519 --> 01:30:08.799]  Really?
[01:30:08.859 --> 01:30:10.741]  Do you have an idea when?
[01:30:10.962 --> 01:30:16.027]  No, it's hard to tell, because as you well know, these markets are being highly manipulated.
[01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:21.653]  And around the world, people are bailing out of bucks, as we spoke about earlier.
[01:30:22.214 --> 01:30:24.396]  And they're looking for a new reserve currency.
[01:30:24.456 --> 01:30:30.042]  I mentioned earlier that the Obama administration is holding out, coming out with their budget projections.
[01:30:30.542 --> 01:30:37.085]  Waiting until the dead heat of summer when everyone's in a vacation state of mind and Congress isn't there.
[01:30:37.505 --> 01:30:42.687]  So there can be some very earth-shaking developments that are going to rattle the dollar.
[01:30:43.247 --> 01:30:49.370]  So it could happen at any time but always remember that the game is going to be manipulated
[01:30:49.870 --> 01:31:01.272]  Because once the world wakes up to the idea that their fiat currencies aren't going to be worth the paper they're printed on, there's going to be a huge run to gold.
[01:31:01.672 --> 01:31:13.674]  Another very important aspect, there's only one member of the G20 out there that's really criticizing America for its stimulus recovery bailout and buyout.
[01:31:13.734 --> 01:31:14.334]  Germany.
[01:31:15.054 --> 01:31:15.634]  And why?
[01:31:16.875 --> 01:31:18.815]  Because of gold issues.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.301]  And they know what it's like.
[01:31:22.101 --> 01:31:24.462]  These are the people, the Weimar Republic.
[01:31:24.822 --> 01:31:31.965]  They still have the people alive that told the stories of going to a supermarket with a wheelbarrow of money.
[01:31:32.906 --> 01:31:41.270]  And they know how it happened because they printed phantom money out of thin air based on nothing and producing practically nothing.
[01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:44.251]  So that's why we're bullish on gold.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:32:14.826]  But the bankers to kill hyperinflation aren't just loaning the money, so instead you have everything imploding while they print fiat to buy up real infrastructure, and then from the experts we've talked to, I want to see if you agree with the general economist we've had on, that then later the hyperinflation comes as an added nightmare over a depression economy, the untold superstorm or perfect storm of hyper-stag inflation.
[01:32:15.174 --> 01:32:16.195]  Yeah, that's very true.
[01:32:16.255 --> 01:32:17.236]  And depression, actually.
[01:32:17.256 --> 01:32:19.238]  It's hyperinflation and depression.
[01:32:19.539 --> 01:32:20.440]  Look at the numbers.
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:25.965]  You well know, depending on who you talk to, the effective unemployment rate is 18.7%.
[01:32:26.846 --> 01:32:29.509]  Others say the unofficial rate is 20%.
[01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:32.492]  So that's what we're really looking at.
[01:32:32.512 --> 01:32:34.915]  These kids are going to college.
[01:32:35.255 --> 01:32:36.817]  Are they going to get jobs doing what?
[01:32:37.130 --> 01:32:38.031]  That's what I was about to say.
[01:32:38.051 --> 01:32:40.973]  You were saying the next big bubble is the college bubble.
[01:32:41.333 --> 01:32:44.496]  They're going into debt now for jobs that aren't even going to exist.
[01:32:44.796 --> 01:32:49.120]  And the commercial real estate, as you said on the show a year and a half ago, is starting to implode.
[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:50.761]  They're saying that's the next big one.
[01:32:51.041 --> 01:32:52.202]  Give us some of those trends.
[01:32:53.283 --> 01:32:58.907]  But going back to gold, because we've interviewed so many experts who are bullish or bearish on gold, but all of them acknowledge
[01:32:59.847 --> 01:33:13.098]  That everybody should be partially in gold and silver as a hedge against inflation, as an emergency parachute to just protect wealth, to make sure you've got something that can't be dissipated overnight like paper.
[01:33:13.218 --> 01:33:28.811]  But, that speculatively, it's also the biggest boon in speculative, because if the dollar does implode or other major currencies, they're all overprinting right now as you know, that's kind of their answer is global inflation, kind of at parity, that gold could go to three, four thousand.
[01:33:29.434 --> 01:33:30.074]  Well, it can.
[01:33:30.094 --> 01:33:31.595]  It really can.
[01:33:31.615 --> 01:33:37.579]  And then if there's war on top of this, because who knows?
[01:33:37.599 --> 01:33:43.964]  They keep talking about bombing Iran, Israel does, or invading them at some level.
[01:33:44.304 --> 01:33:53.450]  And we've said from the onset that if the United States or Israel attack Iran, it's the beginning of World War III.
[01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:56.492]  Because then you're going to start seeing oil prices.
[01:33:56.992 --> 01:33:57.472]  We're good to go.
[01:34:16.065 --> 01:34:27.073]  If the unemployment rate in the United States goes back to 4.5%, we wipe out our trade deficits, our budget deficits, and that's highly unlikely.
[01:34:27.154 --> 01:34:28.434]  And you're physically holding it.
[01:34:28.454 --> 01:34:33.078]  You can dump out of it if it starts going down, or you can wait until it goes back up the next time.
[01:34:33.098 --> 01:34:34.599]  I have to tell you something.
[01:34:34.619 --> 01:34:35.520]  This is very important.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:38.162]  I've been buying gold for a long time.
[01:34:38.562 --> 01:34:41.103]  And I, you know, in life you have ups and downs, you know.
[01:34:41.123 --> 01:34:43.583]  Let's not be, you know, fake about this.
[01:34:43.683 --> 01:34:45.983]  And I've had lean years in my life.
[01:34:46.544 --> 01:34:49.684]  What saved me was having gold.
[01:34:50.504 --> 01:34:58.006]  Because as you well know, you know, getting rid of gold, cashing in gold isn't as easy as writing a check.
[01:34:58.506 --> 01:35:03.867]  So you really have to think twice and three times and four times before you unload that gold.
[01:35:04.736 --> 01:35:15.461]  And so you hold on to that base of wealth without writing a check off to go spend it or to pay a debt.
[01:35:15.842 --> 01:35:25.426]  And what I also did with my gold is I used it as collateral to borrow, knowing that I wanted that gold back.
[01:35:25.727 --> 01:35:32.070]  And I never had any problem loaning money, borrowing money privately, having that as a backdrop.
[01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:34.211]  So I'm a firm believer in gold.
[01:35:35.447 --> 01:35:36.689]  It's good as gold is the saying.
[01:35:36.729 --> 01:35:41.214]  I just wanted to bring that up because everything else is performing like hell right now.
[01:35:41.694 --> 01:35:43.236]  Treasuries almost have no yield.
[01:35:43.316 --> 01:35:44.378]  Everybody's running to them.
[01:35:45.399 --> 01:35:47.601]  And it's just an amazing scam we're witnessing.
[01:35:47.621 --> 01:35:52.007]  I want to go to calls for Gerald Cilente here in just a moment in the time we have left.
[01:35:53.328 --> 01:35:56.470]  How do you see... Well, two questions before I forget.
[01:35:56.550 --> 01:36:00.834]  First, the flu hype killed maybe 200 people worldwide.
[01:36:00.854 --> 01:36:02.895]  They're talking about global force inoculations.
[01:36:03.395 --> 01:36:07.738]  Is this the global World Trade Organization, World Health Organization cover?
[01:36:08.439 --> 01:36:10.561]  What they're doing and why, we don't know.
[01:36:10.581 --> 01:36:13.463]  We're not on the inside, but I will tell you what we're forecasting.
[01:36:13.523 --> 01:36:16.626]  And we're forecasting that there's going to be something.
[01:36:38.678 --> 01:36:42.240]  And we're calling it the new Black Plague, and it's going to be real.
[01:36:42.901 --> 01:36:48.104]  You can't put poison in your food, in the air, in the water.
[01:36:48.525 --> 01:36:54.589]  You just can't keep poisoning the host without causing a host of problems.
[01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:58.051]  So there's going to be something that breaks down the immune systems.
[01:36:58.171 --> 01:36:59.112]  Is this really it?
[01:36:59.652 --> 01:37:00.653]  Probably not.
[01:37:00.773 --> 01:37:03.875]  Are the drug companies going to benefit from anything that happens?
[01:37:04.495 --> 01:37:05.356]  Absolutely.
[01:37:05.777 --> 01:37:19.012]  Will they use something like this as the false flag to declare martial law and to take the people that were once the home of the free and the brave
[01:37:23.818 --> 01:37:29.566]  Yes, they could very well use something like that as a scare tactic.
[01:37:29.887 --> 01:37:36.256]  I mean, Bush used the most effective one that I've seen in my lifetime with the War on Terror.
[01:37:38.527 --> 01:37:41.669]  Absolutely, and then they've got the continuing imploding economy.
[01:37:42.650 --> 01:37:56.299]  I mean, people have to go to the government for help through that, and then now they're announcing he's breaking all his promises, he's going to raise health care taxes on everybody, and surtaxes and green taxes on everybody's electricity.
[01:37:56.399 --> 01:38:03.603]  I mean, would you say Obama wins or is a contender for the crown of the biggest liar?
[01:38:03.663 --> 01:38:04.944]  Because I thought Clinton was a liar.
[01:38:04.984 --> 01:38:05.885]  I thought Bush was a liar.
[01:38:06.505 --> 01:38:24.694]  Well, the thing that we put Obama in is the mass destruction of what was once the entrepreneurial empire into what Mussolini said, the merger of state and corporate powers into fascism, where government and major corporations are running the whole show.
[01:38:24.794 --> 01:38:29.476]  Again, you know, look at the people, look at the banks, look at the control.
[01:38:30.036 --> 01:38:31.537]  And so that's what we see.
[01:38:31.837 --> 01:38:34.979]  And by the way, people ask us, what are some of the solutions?
[01:38:35.539 --> 01:38:36.981]  Well, here's one solution.
[01:38:37.622 --> 01:38:39.544]  We don't need Wall Street.
[01:38:40.304 --> 01:38:41.566]  We need Main Street.
[01:38:42.146 --> 01:38:44.109]  We don't need Walmarts.
[01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:46.051]  We need mom and pops.
[01:38:46.591 --> 01:38:48.814]  We don't need agribusiness.
[01:38:49.595 --> 01:38:51.677]  We need family farms.
[01:38:52.198 --> 01:38:54.200]  We don't need Monsanto.
[01:38:54.873 --> 01:38:56.054]  We need organic.
[01:38:56.475 --> 01:38:59.417]  And this is not hyperbole, it's a fact.
[01:38:59.858 --> 01:39:09.167]  A fact based on the knowledge that we were, the United States of America, the most egalitarian nation on earth.
[01:39:09.747 --> 01:39:13.971]  Respected and envied by everyone else on earth.
[01:39:14.652 --> 01:39:18.596]  From the most egalitarian, when that model existed.
[01:39:19.276 --> 01:39:43.572]  Main Street, Mom and Pop, Family Farm, and Organic, we have now become the nation where the gap between the rich and the poor is the widest of any of the industrialized nations, and where we used to be number one in healthcare, in education, in longevity, in quality of life, when we lived by Main Street, Mom and Pop,
[01:39:43.933 --> 01:39:50.900]  Because we're mentally and spiritually poisoned and the establishment knew that and all those big
[01:40:00.071 --> 01:40:05.455]  Vertically integrated corporate structures are waging war against mom and pop and Main Street.
[01:40:05.796 --> 01:40:10.299]  And now they've got the Animal ID, the Primus Society openly to shut down family farms and ranches.
[01:40:10.739 --> 01:40:13.462]  The Clean Water Restoration Act to federalize all the water.
[01:40:14.082 --> 01:40:20.307]  I mean, they're coming in as the economy implodes trying to pass the carbon tax, knowing it'll shut things down further.
[01:40:20.767 --> 01:40:23.470]  This is like the global mafia burning us out.
[01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.551]  What?
[01:40:24.871 --> 01:40:26.914]  So you're saying the revolution isn't just physical?
[01:40:27.275 --> 01:40:38.111]  It's gonna be people not going to Walmart anymore, people planning their own gardens, people not doing what the local thugs and feds say, and people just getting back to basics?
[01:40:38.472 --> 01:40:39.854]  Or what else is in the revolution?
[01:40:41.886 --> 01:40:44.127]  My thing is I boycott corporate food.
[01:40:44.467 --> 01:40:45.108]  I won't eat it.
[01:40:45.168 --> 01:40:45.408]  I won't.
[01:40:45.888 --> 01:40:46.969]  I go to the local guy.
[01:40:46.989 --> 01:40:48.790]  I won't go to the Dunkin Donuts guy.
[01:40:48.810 --> 01:40:51.171]  You know, I support.
[01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:52.772]  I go to the farmer's markets.
[01:40:53.232 --> 01:40:55.754]  I don't buy factory food.
[01:40:56.034 --> 01:40:58.956]  You know, Alex, we just saw Obama.
[01:40:58.976 --> 01:41:06.480]  They made a whole big deal about them planting their organic garden and buying local food and how healthy they eat.
[01:41:07.441 --> 01:41:10.824]  Let the rest of them eat frankenfoods is their motto.
[01:41:11.485 --> 01:41:17.031]  It's okay for them and the Clintons and the Bushes to everybody to only eat the best.
[01:41:17.432 --> 01:41:22.277]  But the rest of you people out there, fatten yourself up on the junk food.
[01:41:22.737 --> 01:41:24.539]  What goes in goes out.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.823]  Junk food, junk minds, junk thinking.
[01:41:28.363 --> 01:41:28.824]  I don't know.
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:44.461]  We're multi-millionaires!
[01:41:44.961 --> 01:41:46.001]  Where do they come off?
[01:41:46.281 --> 01:41:56.665]  Goldman Sachs saying that, well we earn these profits and we're distributing this money, these bonuses to our people because we're such brilliant traders.
[01:41:57.105 --> 01:41:57.566]  Oh yeah?
[01:41:57.586 --> 01:42:03.508]  How about the 13 billion dollars we gave you to cover your bad bets with AIG?
[01:42:03.968 --> 01:42:08.530]  And then they took the money and then loaned it to us in interest, and it's just total bastards.
[01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:12.152]  We're going to come back in the final segment and talk to Maria, Linda, and Randall.
[01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:19.516]  Quick comments, quick questions from those three callers, quick answers from Gerald Cilente, and I can't wait to have him back up again soon.
[01:42:20.417 --> 01:42:22.258]  But Wendy, we got 30 seconds before break.
[01:42:22.278 --> 01:42:26.040]  Gerald, when do you see physical confrontation, rioting beginning?
[01:42:27.076 --> 01:42:36.160]  You know, we may see riots this summer as the heat of the city's streets becomes uncontrollable, as people can't find jobs and have no future.
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:41.582]  And then they're talking about, by next year, 25% unemployment?
[01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:52.407]  And when you look upon the minority groups, the people that, you know, have no education, and they're drugged out, you have a recipe for violence and disaster.
[01:42:53.007 --> 01:42:54.447]  Stay there, Gerald Solente.
[01:42:54.588 --> 01:42:55.408]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:59.361 --> 01:43:03.406]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[01:43:03.866 --> 01:43:06.829]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.
[01:43:07.230 --> 01:43:11.735]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, and I've been solving tax debt problems for 30 years, and I can help you too.
[01:43:12.095 --> 01:43:16.720]  We can stabilize IRS collection action and get your tax debt reduced, sometimes completely eliminated.
[01:43:17.259 --> 01:43:28.792]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[01:43:29.113 --> 01:43:31.936]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.

[01:43:57.463 --> 01:44:02.769]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:03.489 --> 01:44:08.835]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:09.395 --> 01:44:15.542]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:15.802 --> 01:44:17.702]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:17.842 --> 01:44:20.223]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:20.303 --> 01:44:31.245]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:44:33.485 --> 01:44:34.765]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:35.146 --> 01:44:36.566]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:37.006 --> 01:44:43.227]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:02.963]  Gerald Cilente, I want to jam in a few final calls here for you, but quickly, I have this question.
[01:46:03.243 --> 01:46:13.049]  Can all the King's horses, all the King's men, all the police state grid they've set up, planning this bankruptcy all along, to bring in their new world order, is it going to be successful?
[01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:17.132]  Because even with all the Obama hype, it's not working.
[01:46:17.192 --> 01:46:20.474]  I mean, this looks like it's going to turn into a really bloody confrontation.
[01:46:21.226 --> 01:46:23.108]  Well, it's gonna be ugly.
[01:46:23.148 --> 01:46:24.409]  I mean, now they've changed it.
[01:46:24.429 --> 01:46:26.611]  They're changing their tune from Green Shoots.
[01:46:27.092 --> 01:46:29.254]  Now they're saying a double-dip recession.
[01:46:29.274 --> 01:46:31.016]  It's not a double-dip recession.
[01:46:31.056 --> 01:46:31.717]  It never ended.
[01:46:31.937 --> 01:46:33.278]  Jobless recovery.
[01:46:33.799 --> 01:46:34.720]  Jobless recovery.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.762]  It's like almost pregnant, isn't it?
[01:46:38.499 --> 01:46:41.462]  No, so no, they're not going to be able to stop it.
[01:46:41.502 --> 01:47:02.081]  The only way they will be able to stop it is to continue to do what they're doing and that is to keep the people under federal dictate and to make them more subservient and the pressure that is going to be bearing upon the people at every level from parking meters to property taxes, from federal taxes
[01:47:02.541 --> 01:47:06.645]  Maria in California, you're on the air with Gerald Solente.
[01:47:27.017 --> 01:47:29.784]  Hi Jones and Salente, it's an honor to speak with both of you.
[01:47:30.225 --> 01:47:36.080]  I actually wanted to call in because I'm calling from Pomona, California and in the past two months
[01:47:36.716 --> 01:47:44.122]  The police activity here has gone from hearing them once, maybe every other month, to hearing them three times a day.
[01:47:44.303 --> 01:47:47.005]  I'm hearing the ambulance go off and the police everywhere.
[01:47:47.666 --> 01:47:56.853]  And I just want to know, if I'm living in a suburban area like this, I mean, how bad is it going to get while our city council... Yeah, that's something they're covering up, Gerald, obviously.
[01:47:56.913 --> 01:47:58.054]  Crimes exploding.
[01:47:59.536 --> 01:48:00.976]  They're trying to squeeze the public.
[01:48:01.056 --> 01:48:01.837]  It's not working.
[01:48:01.897 --> 01:48:05.439]  You said a year ago on this show, California was going to collapse.
[01:48:05.799 --> 01:48:06.700]  That's now beginning.
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:07.120]  Gerald?
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:08.461]  Yes, it is beginning.
[01:48:08.481 --> 01:48:10.202]  There's going to be other states to follow.
[01:48:10.262 --> 01:48:12.784]  I mean, Michigan, around Detroit, it's a war zone.
[01:48:13.324 --> 01:48:20.268]  And you know, my saying as a Bronx boy is, when people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[01:48:20.588 --> 01:48:23.510]  We're going to see more of these home invasions, kidnappings.
[01:48:23.970 --> 01:48:26.532]  It's going to turn ugly over the years.
[01:48:27.132 --> 01:48:36.294]  So, I'm a believer in Second Amendment rights, as are you, Alex, and that people need to learn self-protection because nobody's going to protect you.
[01:48:36.314 --> 01:48:47.856]  And as you also know, I'm a close combat practitioner, and John Perkins from attackproof.com has been, you know, my teacher for, you know, many, many years.
[01:48:48.436 --> 01:48:53.657]  So, people have to understand there will be no savior other than yourself.
[01:48:54.258 --> 01:48:54.918]  Absolutely.
[01:48:55.118 --> 01:48:56.398]  Maria, does that answer your question?
[01:48:57.199 --> 01:48:57.700]  Yes it does.
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:48:58.482]  One more question.
[01:48:58.502 --> 01:49:03.191]  I've prepared, I've stockpiled, I have my gun and everything.
[01:49:03.592 --> 01:49:05.576]  What can I do with the rest of my fiat money?
[01:49:06.536 --> 01:49:08.857]  Well, again, we don't give financial advice.
[01:49:08.917 --> 01:49:10.698]  I can only tell you what I do with mine.
[01:49:11.139 --> 01:49:13.420]  And I'm very heavily invested in gold.
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.942]  And I also, what I do is because I run a business, I need cash.
[01:49:18.502 --> 01:49:24.106]  I put my money between different currencies so that if the dollar goes down, the other one goes up.
[01:49:24.346 --> 01:49:25.466]  Maria, you answered that earlier.
[01:49:25.646 --> 01:49:26.407]  We've got to jump.
[01:49:26.447 --> 01:49:28.348]  Final call, Linda in Rhode Island.
[01:49:28.408 --> 01:49:29.909]  Quickly, you're on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[01:49:30.569 --> 01:49:31.790]  Hi, Alex and Gerald.
[01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:33.631]  I have a question for Gerald.
[01:49:33.671 --> 01:49:36.012]  Last week, Bob Chapman was on.
[01:49:36.562 --> 01:49:42.806]  And he stated that they would close the banks for a week and that they were going to open them up again and everything was going to be alright.
[01:49:42.967 --> 01:49:44.868]  I think he was too light-hearted on that.
[01:49:44.888 --> 01:49:46.289]  Can you say something about that?
[01:49:46.809 --> 01:49:50.592]  Well, if they close the banks, we believe that they'll devalue the dollar.
[01:49:50.912 --> 01:49:54.655]  When they reopen them, you won't be able to get all your money back out.
[01:49:54.695 --> 01:49:56.536]  They'll use the Argentinian method.
[01:49:56.856 --> 01:50:03.241]  That's what they did over there when their dollar collapsed and that's what we believe they'll do over here.
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:07.040]  Does that answer your question, Linda?
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:10.441]  You'll be able to get your money, but you won't be able to get it out all at once.
[01:50:11.102 --> 01:50:11.402]  Right.
[01:50:11.702 --> 01:50:14.462]  And it won't be worth what it was if they close the banks.
[01:50:15.883 --> 01:50:19.784]  Yeah, because who's going to want to go to work thinking, oh, maybe they'll get paid in a month?
[01:50:20.324 --> 01:50:21.484]  Yeah, Linda, thank you.
[01:50:23.045 --> 01:50:25.806]  Gerald Salente, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:50:25.846 --> 01:50:27.706]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[01:50:27.766 --> 01:50:28.206]  Thank you.
[01:50:28.506 --> 01:50:29.327]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:50:29.427 --> 01:50:30.627]  Always great being on your show.
[01:50:31.038 --> 01:50:31.579]  God bless you.
[01:50:31.639 --> 01:50:32.520]  It's always great having you.
[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:33.881]  Retransmission starts now.

[01:50:46.786 --> 01:50:52.348]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[01:50:52.649 --> 01:50:53.809]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:50:53.949 --> 01:50:57.911]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[01:50:58.231 --> 01:50:59.792]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:51:00.072 --> 01:51:06.375]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.

[01:51:12.137 --> 01:51:14.917]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:51:15.137 --> 01:51:16.578]  And their formula really works.
[01:51:16.858 --> 01:51:19.419]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.

[01:51:25.921 --> 01:51:28.122]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:51:28.342 --> 01:51:30.622]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:51:30.803 --> 01:51:32.563]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
