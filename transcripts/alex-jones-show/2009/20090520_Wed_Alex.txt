[00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.894]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.762]  Gotten so hyped up today, forgot I was gonna go on TV with a shaving cut.
[00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:46.283]  Gotta go wipe that off during the break.
[00:00:47.603 --> 00:00:48.644]  I am Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.684 --> 00:00:50.725]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:55.388]  And I am going to go over
[00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:13.762]  What happened to Janet Sanchez, and we've got her fiance here with us, Joe Flores, and her eight-year-old daughter, Haley, is out there in the office with some of the other ladies that work here at the office.
[00:01:16.444 --> 00:01:17.844]  Now, this affects everybody.
[00:01:17.884 --> 00:01:21.306]  This affects everybody out there watching, everybody out there listening.
[00:01:23.607 --> 00:01:24.928]  And I'm sure most of you already know this.
[00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:26.289]  Most of you already understand this.
[00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:45.745]  Because just here in the office yesterday when I got off air and found out this was going on and Janet was crying, everybody around the office, including Mike, was going, yeah, when my boy was 8, you know, he's 11 now, he had a bruise on his shin and they saw it in PE and called me in and my son told him I didn't do it, that it was from soccer.
[00:01:46.544 --> 00:01:49.425]  I mean, you don't want to see my kids from playing soccer after soccer practice.
[00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:50.666]  There's bruises all over their legs.
[00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:51.326]  That's what happens.
[00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:56.889]  But they tried to take them and then they tried to say that they said, you know, does your dad smoke?
[00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.730]  And they called smoking cigarettes a drug.
[00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.771]  And they threatened him they'd take his kids if he didn't drug test.
[00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:01.971]  He didn't have any drugs in his system.
[00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:04.652]  This is how crazy the secret police stuff is.
[00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:06.253]  And you have due process.
[00:02:06.273 --> 00:02:07.093]  You're not a slave.
[00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:07.714]  They set up.
[00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:14.300]  The family courts under the eugenics courts to sterilize 400,000 plus Americans in the 20s through the 80s.
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.882]  That's where these special courts came from.
[00:02:17.443 --> 00:02:20.786]  Where they don't follow the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, they lie, they do all the rest of this.
[00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:30.715]  But I wanted to go back and have, before I tell the story briefly and then talk to Janet and Joe, hear about what's happening, I wanted to have
[00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:36.401]  The caller is a former CPS worker who couldn't stand it and got out of it.
[00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:37.702]  DJ in Tennessee on.
[00:02:37.722 --> 00:02:41.706]  We'll also take other calls coming up from others that are patiently holding to tell their stories.
[00:02:42.086 --> 00:02:46.470]  DJ, anything else as a CPS worker about the incredible crimes you witnessed?
[00:02:47.932 --> 00:02:52.296]  Well, I would have to say keep your kids out of the emergency room at all costs.
[00:02:52.496 --> 00:02:55.759]  I mean, that's one, like you said, if a school observes a bruise,
[00:02:56.497 --> 00:03:04.021]  If the ER, I mean, I've brought my children to the emergency room and they treat you like a criminal if it's any kind of injury, like a broken arm, you know?
[00:03:05.222 --> 00:03:10.925]  Listen, one time I was at the pool when I was about 12 at the neighborhood pool and my shoulder got hurt.
[00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:12.826]  Chicken fighting when you get on somebody's shoulders.
[00:03:13.206 --> 00:03:16.288]  And my dad's a neurosurgeon, a dentist, and so he knows the medical system.
[00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:17.429]  He's worked in the hospital.
[00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:18.770]  And I got home
[00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.791]  And, uh, he kind of got real concerned.
[00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:23.552]  He said, listen, they're going to ask you if I did this.
[00:03:23.592 --> 00:03:24.993]  You've got to tell them I didn't.
[00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:28.175]  And he was scared when we went into the, I mean, that's my dad.
[00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:31.677]  Again, this isn't freedom where you're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:03:31.737 --> 00:03:32.758]  Kids get bruises.
[00:03:33.158 --> 00:03:40.263]  I know a lot of kids that have been taken, even though there's witnesses, they fall off the park jungle gym, break their arm, they're gone, especially if they're blonde-haired, blue-eyed.
[00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.444]  That's the big bonuses, as you mentioned.
[00:03:42.484 --> 00:03:48.588]  Did you not, as a CPS worker, see that they really got hungry for those because the adoption agencies can get up to a half million bucks?
[00:03:49.397 --> 00:04:02.046]  You know, it wasn't until years later that that occurred to me, but I did notice that most of the time it seemed like parents with small, small children, I'm talking infants, had a more difficult time getting their parental rights back.
[00:04:02.987 --> 00:04:04.808]  Yeah, they don't want the older kids.
[00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:06.349]  They don't want the older kids.
[00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.210]  They want little kids.
[00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.053]  They want, well, the babies, you know, more people, they're more adoptable.
[00:04:11.213 --> 00:04:16.697]  And also minorities seem to get out of the system faster, oddly enough, because a lot of
[00:04:17.242 --> 00:04:21.965]  The minorities had, you know, less as far as resources to be able to follow through.
[00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:30.772]  Let's face it, there are rich white families that want white kids and they don't care where they come from and so they put the orders out and that's why it goes in order of the most desirable.
[00:04:31.432 --> 00:04:34.034]  It goes white, hispanic, asian, and then black.
[00:04:34.534 --> 00:04:36.436]  And that's who they're out mainly trying to kidnap.
[00:04:38.317 --> 00:04:39.678]  Sadly, that's what I've seen.
[00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:41.099]  I mean, that's my observation.
[00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:43.761]  And it's disgusting.
[00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:46.463]  These rich white yuppies should really check where these kids are coming from.
[00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:48.502]  It's despicable.
[00:04:49.803 --> 00:04:50.323]  It's absolutely despicable.
[00:04:50.343 --> 00:04:55.406]  They'll pay thousands of dollars for a baby, so I don't think they're going to check too hard where those children came from.
[00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:56.526]  A lot of these people.
[00:04:56.747 --> 00:04:57.967]  Well, what about quotas?
[00:04:57.987 --> 00:04:59.808]  Because it's now come out there's federal bounties.
[00:04:59.828 --> 00:05:02.189]  They get bonuses for the more kids they grab.
[00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.472]  I never observed, at least I was never told about having quotas.
[00:05:07.532 --> 00:05:15.736]  I mean, we had to make so many phone calls or take so many phone calls every week from reports.
[00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:17.817]  I mean if you want to call that a quota.
[00:05:18.683 --> 00:05:21.145]  But I was unaware at that point.
[00:05:21.205 --> 00:05:23.726]  I mean, this was back in 98 through 2000.
[00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:29.590]  Oh yeah, the really bad quota stuff started out in 97 under law, wasn't implemented until 98, 99.
[00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.953]  So see, you got out right when that true criminality accelerated.
[00:05:33.993 --> 00:05:39.236]  And that's the point of this is the bureaucracy is growing, growing, getting hungrier and hungrier and hungrier.
[00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:46.941]  And so at this case of Buda Elementary down in Taylor, people should know that just south of me, I have family that lives down there,
[00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:49.303]  I have a cousin who lives there in the military.
[00:05:49.563 --> 00:05:53.527]  You need to know when you send your children to these public schools, and it's not just Buda, it's all over the country.
[00:05:53.988 --> 00:05:54.388]  Everywhere.
[00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:01.716]  I can't tell you how many families I've talked to where a lot of times they'll say your child has ADHD and they might even be 12.
[00:06:02.336 --> 00:06:10.545]  And they take them and then institutionalize them because the state then gets federal money saying your child's mentally ill and they jack them up on all these drugs.
[00:06:11.611 --> 00:06:13.852]  I've seen more of that than you care to know.
[00:06:14.252 --> 00:06:24.995]  People only knew, I mean, children, small, small children on anti-psychotic drugs that you wouldn't even give to a persistently and chronically mentally ill person, adult.
[00:06:26.475 --> 00:06:31.877]  And they're sent to these places, I mean, these mental institutions to
[00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:38.045]  For children that are nothing more than bedlam, where they're continued to be raped and abused further.
[00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:39.486]  Well, you know, I looked into this.
[00:06:40.247 --> 00:06:47.451]  Remember in the 70s and 80s they would show hidden film footage of Russian orphanages where all these kids and piles of crap everywhere and the hell of it?
[00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:50.293]  Did you know Russia doesn't have those anymore?
[00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:52.234]  Because they pay people to have children now.
[00:06:52.534 --> 00:06:54.276]  They're going the opposite of eugenics.
[00:06:54.876 --> 00:06:56.817]  I disagree with a lot of things Russia does, but I agree with that.
[00:06:56.837 --> 00:06:58.319]  They're trying to get families to have children.
[00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.621]  They're being pro-family because Russia is literally their populations imploding.
[00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.843]  They have about 1.2 population replacement.
[00:07:04.523 --> 00:07:08.646]  And the government admits and apologizes that the Socialists, the Communists, wanted to break up the family.
[00:07:09.026 --> 00:07:28.478]  Now we have that here, and it's been in the news, especially in Florida and Michigan, where they warehouse the kids in basically like little cages at the CPS offices, and then how the kids die and they still give kids to these foster parents, and how they lock them up in cages and give them like one hot dog and one water a day, and they're like concentration camp victims.
[00:07:28.538 --> 00:07:30.380]  I mean, it's so hellish!
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:31.600]  Yeah.
[00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:32.741]  Bologna sandwich.
[00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:33.302]  Yeah.
[00:07:35.263 --> 00:07:41.867]  That's why I would say, I mean, if there's anything anybody can take away from the little bit of information I could give you, was educate your children.
[00:07:42.347 --> 00:07:45.629]  Sit down and talk to them about speaking with a guidance counselor.
[00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.973]  Teach them, don't answer those kind of questions and I want my mommy or my daddy there with me.
[00:07:52.333 --> 00:08:00.278]  Because they will come, I'm sorry that's my dog in the background, they will come to the school and interrogate your child without your knowledge or permission.
[00:08:00.298 --> 00:08:02.399]  Well what about them strip-searching their daughter?
[00:08:04.508 --> 00:08:05.489]  I find that incredible.
[00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:16.896]  I mean, I'm assuming a nurse or a medical professional was there too, but I mean, doing that without your parents' approval... And by the way, we've been trying to get this straight from Haley.
[00:08:17.436 --> 00:08:19.878]  It looks like there was a male officer there and a female.
[00:08:20.578 --> 00:08:21.258]  She said a man.
[00:08:21.338 --> 00:08:21.799]  Unbelievable.
[00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:25.960]  So, well the Supreme Court just ruled with those girls for drugs.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.281]  She gave her friend an aspirin and they strip-searched her with males.
[00:08:30.282 --> 00:08:31.302]  Right.
[00:08:31.362 --> 00:08:35.284]  They just said they can do that, but other Supreme Court rulings say no.
[00:08:35.444 --> 00:08:37.785]  So it's kind of a mixed bag, but I don't care what the Supreme Court says.
[00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:40.166]  You know, they said black people weren't human beings before.
[00:08:40.726 --> 00:08:41.887]  And, you know, that was overturned.
[00:08:41.927 --> 00:08:48.309]  Well, listen, I want to get your number, maybe have you on, because I've had other official CPS people on who have quit before, and other family.
[00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:50.230]  Rye Scripps, ma'am, you're very articulate.
[00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.811]  I'd like to have you on as a full guest.
[00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:55.672]  Can I get your, and we can use a fake name if you want, but can I get your number right now off air?
[00:08:56.572 --> 00:08:57.153]  Absolutely.
[00:08:57.533 --> 00:08:58.513]  Okay, we'll get that right now.
[00:08:58.553 --> 00:08:59.254]  Thank you so much.
[00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:01.715]  Okay, God bless you.
[00:09:01.735 --> 00:09:04.516]  John Harmon, please get that from her up there on the phone system.
[00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:10.128]  Okay, let me just try to briefly tell this story, then have the family talk about it.
[00:09:10.148 --> 00:09:21.318]  You know, Janet and Joe and Haley, the little portal girl, so sweet, and I've seen her around here and it's very nice, and everybody likes her around here at the office.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:31.147]  To hear this story, absolutely, it didn't blow me away, because just as that former CPS worker said, this is standard.
[00:09:32.383 --> 00:09:36.325]  Three times a year, it's more, some schools less, they bring them into the counselor.
[00:09:36.345 --> 00:09:39.908]  This happened when I was, this started when I was in high school 18 years ago, 19 years ago.
[00:09:40.388 --> 00:09:41.989]  They call you and they ask, how's family life?
[00:09:42.009 --> 00:09:42.709]  Do you have plenty of money?
[00:09:42.729 --> 00:09:43.630]  Are your parents nice to you?
[00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.111]  And if you don't say anything, they go, are they, did they get you a car?
[00:09:46.412 --> 00:09:47.812]  They're introducing you to talk crap.
[00:09:47.832 --> 00:09:48.253]  No, they didn't.
[00:09:48.493 --> 00:09:49.053]  Are they rude?
[00:09:49.093 --> 00:09:49.654]  Do they fight?
[00:09:50.254 --> 00:09:51.295]  And all these questions were asked.
[00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:52.455]  And they would call each kid in.
[00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:56.158]  You know, they put them in a little auditorium area and they would call them back.
[00:09:56.558 --> 00:09:57.699]  And they got her in there.
[00:09:58.704 --> 00:10:00.586]  And what kid doesn't have bruises on their legs?
[00:10:00.686 --> 00:10:07.251]  There she is with the shorts, because it was pajama day that all these schools have.
[00:10:07.431 --> 00:10:10.133]  It's the last week of school, they have a pajama day usually on the Monday or the Friday.
[00:10:10.614 --> 00:10:12.215]  And she sees a little bruise there on her thigh.
[00:10:12.235 --> 00:10:14.076]  I mean, it's a little bitty, I've seen it, it's a little bitty thing.
[00:10:14.797 --> 00:10:21.663]  After walking into a table, kids always say, she has a few little bruises, you know, on her legs, like my kids do, from gymnastics and running and jumping.
[00:10:21.863 --> 00:10:23.304]  Little tiny ones, you can barely see them.
[00:10:23.744 --> 00:10:24.545]  This is normal, though.
[00:10:24.585 --> 00:10:26.747]  I mean, with me, I was cuts everywhere and black eyes.
[00:10:27.287 --> 00:10:34.332]  You know, just, you know, broken fingers because I was wild and skateboarding by the time I was 10, you know, huge scrapes on me, missing half the skin on my back.
[00:10:34.952 --> 00:10:38.595]  I mean, I would have been gone in today's society.
[00:10:39.255 --> 00:10:44.799]  But just to finish this up here, and we're going to go to him, get the timeline clear.
[00:10:46.135 --> 00:10:53.380]  And we have the name of the counselor and everybody here, just absolutely disgusting.
[00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:55.602]  And to them this is normal.
[00:10:55.622 --> 00:11:02.847]  All we have is the secret police, because if it saves one child, you know, better that ten innocent kids be taken than one child abused doesn't.
[00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:07.410]  See, this is the opposite of ten guilty men go free than one innocent.
[00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.772]  And of course, again, the system is five times more likely to abuse you.
[00:11:09.812 --> 00:11:10.292]  That's key.
[00:11:10.532 --> 00:11:13.515]  These are people that are above the law and very bad on average in the system.
[00:11:14.295 --> 00:11:15.895]  And so then they interrogate her.
[00:11:15.935 --> 00:11:18.556]  They say, you know, did your mom do that?
[00:11:18.856 --> 00:11:20.496]  And Haley said, no, my mom didn't do that.
[00:11:20.516 --> 00:11:22.697]  I'll hurt myself if my grandma walks into the table.
[00:11:23.037 --> 00:11:23.537]  You can see it.
[00:11:23.577 --> 00:11:24.397]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:25.497]  You can see the corner.
[00:11:26.437 --> 00:11:28.998]  And then she said, well, does your mom spank you?
[00:11:29.018 --> 00:11:29.918]  Well, no, not really.
[00:11:29.998 --> 00:11:32.019]  I guess a few times, which, by the way, isn't illegal.
[00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:33.599]  And, you know, not lately.
[00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:36.399]  And then, OK, well, the next day, the police show up.
[00:11:36.439 --> 00:11:37.340]  They take her to the nurse.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.980]  They tell her, take your pants off.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.362]  Because this day she's wearing jeans, and she says she was wearing them yesterday when she came.
[00:11:42.642 --> 00:11:43.283]  She said, well, no.
[00:11:43.883 --> 00:11:45.604]  And they said, do it right now or you're in trouble.
[00:11:45.664 --> 00:11:46.785]  And the police told her to do it.
[00:11:47.305 --> 00:11:53.309]  So she pulls her pants off, and she's very embarrassed when she's talking about this, and looked for other bruises and didn't find them.
[00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.231]  But took photos of the one little bruise.
[00:11:57.912 --> 00:12:01.174]  And then they may have gotten a protective snatch order.
[00:12:01.214 --> 00:12:04.316]  They won't say when I talk to them, but we're about to have the lawyers talk to them.
[00:12:04.336 --> 00:12:08.099]  We've got to wait until Janet can get off air and go talk to them on the conference call.
[00:12:09.847 --> 00:12:13.589]  And so the police are there, they strip search her, and they say, your mother did this.
[00:12:13.609 --> 00:12:14.209]  And she said, no.
[00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:20.071]  And the policeman, they said, wearing yellow shirt tucked into jeans.
[00:12:20.091 --> 00:12:23.813]  That's what they wear in Pace County a lot of the time, plain clothes.
[00:12:24.673 --> 00:12:28.235]  And then one in a uniform said, and she said male and female.
[00:12:29.195 --> 00:12:30.616]  The CPS was a female.
[00:12:30.636 --> 00:12:31.456]  Yeah, the CPS was a female.
[00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:34.117]  Male cop in there with a little girl in her panties, 8 year old.
[00:12:34.997 --> 00:12:36.478]  This is what they do.
[00:12:37.198 --> 00:12:37.778]  And they said,
[00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:41.497]  They said, tell the truth or you're in trouble.
[00:12:41.517 --> 00:12:43.459]  And she said, no, they didn't do that.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.481]  And I told you.
[00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:48.744]  And they said, you're going to get in trouble, you tell me right now.
[00:12:48.764 --> 00:12:51.767]  By the way, she wouldn't take her pants off, they said, or you're going to get in trouble.
[00:12:51.787 --> 00:12:53.749]  And now their argument is, well, she took her pants off willingly.
[00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:56.952]  A minor doesn't work that way in the law, and you people know that.
[00:12:56.972 --> 00:12:58.573]  I'm going to call you scum, that's what you are.
[00:12:59.134 --> 00:13:00.835]  Violating her due process, not calling her parents.
[00:13:03.055 --> 00:13:03.976]  Take it off or you're in trouble.
[00:13:04.156 --> 00:13:04.876]  So you forced her.
[00:13:05.057 --> 00:13:09.720]  That'd be like if an adult grabbed a kid in the park and said, uh, have sex with me or you're in trouble.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.381]  You raped him.
[00:13:10.641 --> 00:13:12.842]  You can say, well, the little kid, you know, get it when I told him to.
[00:13:13.203 --> 00:13:15.264]  Put a gun to a woman's head and say, I'm gonna rape you.
[00:13:15.585 --> 00:13:16.665]  You know, you raped him.
[00:13:17.386 --> 00:13:19.608]  Well, you forced her to take her pants off.
[00:13:20.188 --> 00:13:20.909]  Little eight year old.
[00:13:21.589 --> 00:13:21.929]  Okay?
[00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:23.350]  And you didn't find what you wanted.
[00:13:24.051 --> 00:13:25.212]  So you wanted to get in their house.
[00:13:25.252 --> 00:13:27.754]  You start calling her at work at three o'clock.
[00:13:28.852 --> 00:13:37.176]  And she was going to gymnastics then, threatening Janet Sanchez that you had to come meet at her house.
[00:13:37.196 --> 00:13:42.878]  They wanted to go to Janet's house, her house, just south of Austin, here in Kyle, by Buda.
[00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:44.779]  Or is it Taylor?
[00:13:44.819 --> 00:13:45.520]  Taylor's north of here.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.360]  I get all the names mixed up.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.000]  Taylor's north.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:47.841]  We live in Kyle.
[00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:48.401]  It's Kyle.
[00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:48.841]  It's Kyle.
[00:13:49.722 --> 00:13:50.602]  Just so many facts.
[00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:53.618]  I know Taylor's north of us folks, 20 miles.
[00:13:53.638 --> 00:13:54.618]  This is south.
[00:13:54.998 --> 00:13:55.758]  This is Kyle.
[00:13:55.798 --> 00:13:57.119]  Kyle, I have family in Kyle, not Taylor.
[00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:00.340]  And so they're down there in Buda, down by Niederwald and all that.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.561]  South of Austin, in between here and San Marcos.
[00:14:03.602 --> 00:14:07.983]  And so, and correct me anytime I'm wrong, we're going to go to you in a moment.
[00:14:08.003 --> 00:14:09.284]  We've got a lawyer coming up next hour.
[00:14:09.804 --> 00:14:11.965]  And so all of this goes on.
[00:14:13.337 --> 00:14:28.531]  And I tell her, I say, in my experience, and I'm online checking the law sources and things, I'm going to Mike's things, most lawyers, like all lawyers we've talked to in family, say don't, get a lawyer first, don't go home, they're going to force their way in, one dirty dish, one piece of dog hair, they're going to say it's neglect.
[00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:33.555]  You heard about the two blonde haired kids from The Last Lady being taken for sleeping on mats when their house burned down.
[00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:36.158]  Even though they'd be sleeping on those at the Salvation Army.
[00:14:36.318 --> 00:14:38.440]  They'll be sleeping in a cage once they're in CPS hands.
[00:14:39.714 --> 00:14:41.617]  And, uh, I said, uh, no, call her.
[00:14:41.637 --> 00:14:46.205]  And I said, I'm not gonna tell you what to do, but what I would say, meet her at a gas station and see what she says.
[00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:48.649]  She calls back, she goes, okay, I'll meet you at the Dutch Roll Shell.
[00:14:48.669 --> 00:14:53.617]  And I said, okay, we'll drive to the parking lot and see if there's an unmarked or marked police car.
[00:14:54.406 --> 00:14:54.686]  With her.
[00:14:55.407 --> 00:15:06.134]  She gets there in five minutes, she goes, oh my god, I'm here in the parking lot, there's a guy, looks like he has a gun on his side, with a t-shirt partway over it, he's at her car, he's driving a black Mercury Unmarked, and he's at the window with the lady.
[00:15:06.395 --> 00:15:08.616]  I go, okay, drive out of the parking lot, call her, ask if she's there.
[00:15:08.696 --> 00:15:09.317]  Yes, she's there.
[00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:10.478]  Okay, that's pretty much her.
[00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:14.280]  But she didn't like it when I called this morning and said, we saw you in the parking lot with your little friend.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.602]  She starts going, starts shaking, oh sir, oh.
[00:15:16.622 --> 00:15:18.684]  You know, the point is, this is how these creeps operate.
[00:15:18.704 --> 00:15:20.285]  They wouldn't tell you, we want to talk to you.
[00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:25.549]  What the talking was going to be, you sign this paperwork, and don't worry, you'll get your daughter back, just sign it.
[00:15:25.809 --> 00:15:26.570]  Boom, they'd have taken her.
[00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.192]  They get you to waive your rights, or they have the court order.
[00:15:29.712 --> 00:15:31.694]  But they won't say, so we're not violating court order.
[00:15:32.374 --> 00:15:36.838]  These phony things, they always fill them out wrong too, so they can, that's official oppression, we'll catch them in that.
[00:15:36.858 --> 00:15:38.019]  There's lots of stuff, we're going to get them.
[00:15:38.439 --> 00:15:38.920]  Right.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:45.062]  To me, I don't want a Lamborghini Testarossa or a Lamborghini Kutosh.
[00:15:45.162 --> 00:15:46.422]  I don't want a supermodel.
[00:15:46.542 --> 00:15:47.882]  I don't want a castle.
[00:15:48.242 --> 00:15:49.643]  I want criminals to go to prison.
[00:15:50.103 --> 00:15:50.903]  Government criminals.
[00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:54.644]  To me, this is like piles of diamonds to defeat them, to crush them.
[00:15:55.324 --> 00:15:55.564]  Okay?
[00:15:55.604 --> 00:15:57.585]  I mean, literally, I want the treasure, the jewel of liberty.
[00:15:58.085 --> 00:15:59.545]  And so it's my... Anyways.
[00:15:59.565 --> 00:16:02.066]  I want everybody else to learn how to deal with them.
[00:16:02.366 --> 00:16:03.927]  So when we come back, we're going to go to you guys.
[00:16:04.007 --> 00:16:05.047]  I just wanted to lay this out.
[00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:28.189]  So then, they start calling your mother, trying to intimidate her, and they say, she's not allowed to have the child, but doesn't, you know, give her the authority, just tells her, hey slave, that's how they do, you've got to have, really they were just wanting to have her take over there so they could get her, make her mom feel important, you have to come get her, because she lives near you, you have to come get her, she's not allowed to stay with your daughter anymore.
[00:16:29.025 --> 00:16:30.166]  You know, of the mother anymore.
[00:16:30.946 --> 00:16:37.511]  So that right there means they're either threatening without the order, which is a big official oppression, going around ordering people around.
[00:16:37.531 --> 00:16:41.974]  A cop can't come to your house, a CPS can't come to your house and say, come polish my, you know, come wax my car.
[00:16:42.975 --> 00:16:44.136]  They can't say, do my nails.
[00:16:44.196 --> 00:16:46.778]  They can't say, unpack my garage.
[00:16:47.198 --> 00:16:49.459]  Or they can't come and say, you will now take your daughter here.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.803]  And again, even when they get these court orders, which they probably don't have, they may have now, they're fake.
[00:16:54.503 --> 00:16:58.506]  It's like they write blank warrants to take blood at checkpoints in Austin without warrants.
[00:16:59.445 --> 00:16:59.945]  It's not real.
[00:17:00.445 --> 00:17:01.266]  This is America.
[00:17:01.306 --> 00:17:02.146]  This is not Russia.
[00:17:02.186 --> 00:17:03.027]  This is not China.
[00:17:03.487 --> 00:17:06.848]  This is precious and liberty that we have here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:06.908 --> 00:17:11.310]  So, the government's not God, the police are not God, and the CPS workers sure aren't God.
[00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.511]  They have not one one-tenth the authority police or sheriff's deputies have.
[00:17:18.493 --> 00:17:20.414]  So, all of this is going on.
[00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:27.544]  All of this is happening, and so now we're getting our lawyers, we're going through this, we're fighting this.
[00:17:27.564 --> 00:17:29.185]  But remember, this is happening to everybody.
[00:17:29.225 --> 00:17:30.487]  This could happen to you next.
[00:17:31.445 --> 00:17:42.528]  When you put your children in public schools and now most private are, quote, complying for their insurance regulations, they bring your children in, guilty until proven innocent, with snooping operations like the Soviet Union to break up the family.
[00:17:42.548 --> 00:17:52.870]  And I have the textbooks they teach the social workers saying the families of disease belonging to the prehistoric times, it must be abolished and replaced with kids in cages getting one bologna sandwich a day.
[00:18:00.953 --> 00:18:01.514]  You worry.
[00:18:01.654 --> 00:18:03.714]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:04.275]  Hi.
[00:18:04.555 --> 00:18:07.016]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:11.558]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:18:11.858 --> 00:18:14.039]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:18:14.339 --> 00:18:17.401]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:19.401]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:22.143]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[00:18:22.403 --> 00:18:25.824]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[00:18:26.124 --> 00:18:30.226]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[00:18:30.546 --> 00:18:34.288]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[00:18:34.628 --> 00:18:40.634]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:43.116]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[00:18:43.316 --> 00:18:44.998]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[00:18:45.438 --> 00:18:49.642]  So go to upthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:18:50.103 --> 00:18:50.743]  Start now.
[00:18:51.003 --> 00:18:51.964]  Knowledge is power.
[00:18:52.725 --> 00:18:53.526]  Better take action.
[00:18:53.726 --> 00:18:54.687]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.709]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:14.202]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:19:14.807 --> 00:19:20.969]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:19:21.389 --> 00:19:23.210]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.770]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:19:25.851 --> 00:19:36.794]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:19:37.418 --> 00:19:38.719]  It's not about left or right.
[00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:40.479]  It's about a one world government.
[00:19:40.959 --> 00:19:47.302]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:19:47.862 --> 00:19:55.645]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:19:56.125 --> 00:19:57.285]  The Obama Deception.
[00:19:57.705 --> 00:19:58.886]  The people strike back.
[00:20:02.153 --> 00:20:12.476]  The New World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals, and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:18.839]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:21.960]  Starve or surrender.
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:27.621]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:20:27.641 --> 00:20:28.322]  What then?
[00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.351]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:20:33.591 --> 00:20:37.752]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:20:37.892 --> 00:20:40.793]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[00:20:40.873 --> 00:20:47.916]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[00:20:48.116 --> 00:20:49.896]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:20:50.016 --> 00:20:55.418]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.
[00:20:55.578 --> 00:20:57.219]  See his link at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:21:02.235 --> 00:21:02.944]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.953 --> 00:21:21.302]  Okay, um... We're not gonna get into too many more details about Haley, but we may, with the cameras off, as we're live at Prison1.tv, have her in here with a letter just to, on record here, from the eyewitness that they told her, you're gonna get in trouble if you don't tell us what your mommy did.
[00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.183]  And they said, your mommy did that bruise.
[00:21:23.523 --> 00:21:24.524]  Your mommy did that bruise.
[00:21:25.264 --> 00:21:27.846]  And they may be coming to arrest Janet Sanchez.
[00:21:28.886 --> 00:21:30.727]  We've got her fiancé here, Joe.
[00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:33.758]  You guys have got the floor.
[00:21:33.858 --> 00:21:35.959]  Tell folks what it's been like going through this.
[00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:40.239]  And we're going to try to get the numbers out to this county.
[00:21:40.639 --> 00:21:42.940]  Again, I can't help everybody, but this has happened in my own backyard.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.860]  I'm asking folks for help.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.101]  This is also an educational thing on air of how folks can counter this.
[00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:47.721]  Go ahead, Janet.
[00:21:48.261 --> 00:21:48.681]  Okay.
[00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:55.042]  It's just been really emotional because my daughter feels like it's her fault that all this has happened.
[00:21:56.002 --> 00:21:57.582]  And I think it's crazy.
[00:21:57.642 --> 00:21:58.443]  It's ridiculous.
[00:21:58.623 --> 00:22:00.243]  She had one bruise.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.081]  Um, I took pictures.
[00:22:03.821 --> 00:22:07.323]  They took pictures yesterday and I saw the bruise and there's one bruise.
[00:22:07.403 --> 00:22:09.565]  I don't... Now you took pictures last night.
[00:22:09.585 --> 00:22:11.386]  To be clear, they first interrogated her Monday.
[00:22:11.546 --> 00:22:11.706]  Monday.
[00:22:11.726 --> 00:22:12.907]  Had police there yesterday.
[00:22:12.927 --> 00:22:13.007]  Yeah.
[00:22:13.027 --> 00:22:14.147]  You took a photo.
[00:22:14.508 --> 00:22:17.509]  Yeah, and they took pictures yesterday and had her pull her pants down yesterday.
[00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:25.074]  And, um, so that was two days that they... Since when do men get to strip search little girls?
[00:22:25.134 --> 00:22:27.115]  I mean, this country is just really going to hell.
[00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:33.073]  I don't know if the, I think she told me both of the male cops were out of the office.
[00:22:33.854 --> 00:22:37.075]  But the CPS lady and the nurse and counselor were in there.
[00:22:37.095 --> 00:22:39.136]  Yeah, well it wasn't clear, but she said the cops ordered her.
[00:22:39.196 --> 00:22:39.976]  They said, they said.
[00:22:40.016 --> 00:22:41.777]  They told her that she needed to take her.
[00:22:42.057 --> 00:22:43.437]  Her pants off or she would be in trouble.
[00:22:43.457 --> 00:22:47.139]  And that they made her, she asked them to close the miniblinds because she felt that uncomfortable.
[00:22:47.459 --> 00:22:52.581]  My God, and then they have told her to, she said twice, they said, tell the truth, your mother did that.
[00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:53.241]  Unbelievable.
[00:22:53.282 --> 00:22:56.723]  She tried to tell them, you know, I do not want to remove my pants now.
[00:22:57.349 --> 00:23:00.672]  But they told her, if you don't take your pants off, you're going to be in trouble.
[00:23:00.692 --> 00:23:02.773]  So she had to do what they told her.
[00:23:02.813 --> 00:23:03.474]  It's terrorism.
[00:23:03.834 --> 00:23:11.460]  They forced her to do something, and that right there does not make me happy or her happy, and it's very stressful right now.
[00:23:11.921 --> 00:23:18.446]  Janet, what happened yesterday when I said, do what you want, but this is what I would do, and later I'll give you lawyer printouts where that's what they recommend.
[00:23:19.046 --> 00:23:23.950]  I said, why don't you meet her at a gas station, and then I said, but drive through, because there's probably going to be a cop there.
[00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.751]  Tell folks what you saw.
[00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:36.604]  Uh, there was a unmarked car, it looked like, and another, a lady sitting in the car, so I'm assuming those were the people I was meeting, because they weren't parked in front of the gas station, as if they were getting off or anything.
[00:23:36.645 --> 00:23:46.529]  And you said she was, the, the, the cop guy was out and had, like, something on his... Yeah, I saw something black on the side of his pocket, so I assume maybe it was just... But you weren't looking too close, I told you, don't look, don't look, get out of there!
[00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:49.911]  Yeah, you were like, don't look, they're gonna see you suspicious or something.
[00:23:50.819 --> 00:24:09.069]  So I just I just drove through and like not even a minute or two later she called she asked where I was I told her I was just pulling out of the I mean I didn't well I confirmed that was her I I called her this morning I mean I wouldn't be able to meet her but I mean that was her there because I called her this morning I said we saw you and your friend there at the gas station she said oh you did and I was like yeah so she said she was at the gas station where was I
[00:24:10.106 --> 00:24:12.207]  And I told her, I'm not going to meet you, I'm sorry.
[00:24:12.667 --> 00:24:13.527]  And then she threatened you.
[00:24:13.547 --> 00:24:15.688]  She said, I'm going to have to call the police if you don't come in.
[00:24:15.708 --> 00:24:18.069]  Yeah, she's like, I was just informing them that you were uncooperative.
[00:24:18.109 --> 00:24:19.470]  I was like, well, I can meet with you tomorrow.
[00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:20.610]  So I made arrangements.
[00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.091]  Yeah, you've got to meet when they want.
[00:24:22.111 --> 00:24:24.312]  I mean, it's like when they come to your door, you go, no, you don't have a warrant.
[00:24:24.492 --> 00:24:25.112]  This is my house.
[00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:26.593]  Get out of here, you little scumbag.
[00:24:26.813 --> 00:24:27.873]  You're just here to get money.
[00:24:28.873 --> 00:24:32.475]  I mean, folks, my children have bruises all over them year round.
[00:24:32.495 --> 00:24:33.875]  They're always playing.
[00:24:33.895 --> 00:24:34.736]  They have a treehouse.
[00:24:35.523 --> 00:24:45.086]  I mean, when they're in gymnastics, swimming, soccer, basketball, I mean, you know, my son's had his lip busted by the basketball hitting him.
[00:24:45.106 --> 00:24:46.987]  Will I lose him because of the YMCA basketball?
[00:24:47.227 --> 00:24:49.428]  When they play soccer, they get bruises?
[00:24:49.468 --> 00:24:50.968]  I mean, is soccer illegal?
[00:24:51.028 --> 00:24:53.629]  I mean... Correct.
[00:24:53.749 --> 00:24:56.150]  It's very, very frustrating over here on our end.
[00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.111]  I've had this happen before.
[00:24:58.973 --> 00:25:02.336]  Counselors gave me a call that my son has bruises on their legs.
[00:25:02.697 --> 00:25:07.541]  It's where they just take advantage of the children and that really is wrong.
[00:25:07.802 --> 00:25:10.945]  But Joe, that's bad enough for them to call you and be secret police.
[00:25:11.125 --> 00:25:15.709]  They called the cops and strip searched her and took photos and are now running around with cops after you.
[00:25:17.674 --> 00:25:22.638]  I mean, if they were that concerned, they would have made arrangements for me to be there Tuesday, because all this happened Monday.
[00:25:22.658 --> 00:25:24.299]  No, no, they don't want you to know.
[00:25:24.519 --> 00:25:25.840]  Yeah, so... They do this in secret.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.782]  I questioned her two days without my knowledge.
[00:25:27.802 --> 00:25:29.523]  I mean, I asked her why she didn't tell me.
[00:25:29.583 --> 00:25:31.925]  She said she was scared, so I don't know what they told her.
[00:25:31.945 --> 00:25:33.346]  Like, don't... Well, I talked to her.
[00:25:33.366 --> 00:25:34.347]  They told her not to talk to you.
[00:25:34.387 --> 00:25:35.528]  Remember, that was in the conversation.
[00:25:35.568 --> 00:25:36.508]  So... Stay right there.
[00:25:36.548 --> 00:25:40.091]  We'll be back in 70 seconds, fighting the child kidnappers.

[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.082]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:26:00.282 --> 00:26:03.144]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:26:03.324 --> 00:26:08.048]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:26:08.268 --> 00:26:09.189]  If you simply prepare.
[00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:12.351]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[00:26:53.664 --> 00:26:55.565]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:56.045 --> 00:26:58.905]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:05.267 --> 00:27:05.927]  Big Brother.
[00:27:06.567 --> 00:27:07.628]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:08.348 --> 00:27:09.468]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:10.108 --> 00:27:10.929]  You want answers?
[00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:12.609]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:12.629 --> 00:27:17.010]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.771]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:21.491]  Alex Jones.
[00:27:22.132 --> 00:27:26.138]  We got a lawyer coming on in 15 minutes, one of the ones recommended by some of the
[00:27:27.318 --> 00:27:31.101]  Parent rights and homeschool defense groups because they really harass homeschoolers.
[00:27:31.361 --> 00:27:32.863]  They've even had to pass a lot of state laws.
[00:27:33.303 --> 00:27:46.674]  Texas has had to pass state laws decrying CPS and the whole system because it came out that the entire Youth Commission operation was at every facility raping the children.
[00:27:46.774 --> 00:27:50.957]  That's the Texas Youth Commission and I have the new laws here written to counter that.
[00:27:51.806 --> 00:27:53.230]  I mean, this is getting serious, folks.
[00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:58.404]  I mean, this is, this, and you heard the CPS worker earlier, you know, admitting that there's all these criminals involved in it.
[00:27:59.213 --> 00:28:02.276]  Okay, so we're talking to Joe and Janet.
[00:28:02.296 --> 00:28:04.978]  We're talking about Haley, your daughter.
[00:28:04.998 --> 00:28:07.339]  I mean, I wanted the truth.
[00:28:07.379 --> 00:28:08.680]  Plus, spanking's not illegal.
[00:28:10.162 --> 00:28:13.264]  But I know when I look at a bruise and it's that big on her thigh, that wasn't even it.
[00:28:13.304 --> 00:28:15.346]  And I know she was telling the truth, because I've got a good B.S.
[00:28:15.366 --> 00:28:15.766]  detector.
[00:28:15.786 --> 00:28:16.106]  I'll do this.
[00:28:16.547 --> 00:28:18.028]  That you didn't do that to her.
[00:28:18.048 --> 00:28:18.708]  It doesn't matter.
[00:28:19.008 --> 00:28:20.409]  The point is, you don't strip search her.
[00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:21.811]  You don't not follow due process.
[00:28:22.111 --> 00:28:22.991]  You go get a warrant.
[00:28:23.011 --> 00:28:24.052]  You go get an indictment.
[00:28:24.072 --> 00:28:27.115]  You know, but the family courts don't think that they have to do that.
[00:28:27.135 --> 00:28:28.476]  We're going to give their phone numbers out.
[00:28:29.016 --> 00:28:34.523]  Coming up in the next segment, other points you guys want to add?
[00:28:35.364 --> 00:28:36.105]  I don't know.
[00:28:36.665 --> 00:28:45.816]  I feel really bad for me and Haley just because we're going to go into school and I'm going to be recognized as that lady who beat her child.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:29:04.364]  Whatever they think, and... Yeah, you called this morning to say you were taking her to the doctor, and they were, like, suddenly, you know, usually you call to say your kid's gonna be sick, she said she's been sick three times this year, and they're like, okay, fine, this was 20 questions, they were like, oh, oh, hi Janet, you're not, you're gonna take her to the doctor if she's sick, right?
[00:29:04.564 --> 00:29:10.565]  You're not abusing her, so they're just like, they're, again, they're all, they're all little secret police minions now.
[00:29:10.685 --> 00:29:14.746]  Yeah, I don't know if that's their protocol, but I'm... No, it's not, they're secret police.
[00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:19.033]  I just feel really bad.
[00:29:19.354 --> 00:29:22.677]  We drive her across town thinking she's going to a better school.
[00:29:23.078 --> 00:29:24.479]  She's on a student transfer.
[00:29:24.499 --> 00:29:24.719]  A&B student?
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:25.760]  Yeah.
[00:29:28.939 --> 00:29:31.620]  Well, Buda is only, what, about 8% Hispanic.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.021]  And I don't know if this is a race card issue, but that needs to be investigated.
[00:29:34.061 --> 00:29:41.084]  You're saying mostly... I mean, there's always that subconscious thing of... And we've seen this with the eugenics, how these family courts were set up.
[00:29:41.364 --> 00:29:43.945]  They first mainly grabbed Native Americans and blacks.
[00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:47.947]  And then they moved on to everybody else by the 60s and 70s and 80s.
[00:29:47.987 --> 00:29:51.048]  But the family courts were set up to carry out racial hygiene.
[00:29:51.668 --> 00:29:55.650]  So they were set up inherently to attack non-whites.
[00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:56.430]  Right.
[00:29:57.312 --> 00:29:57.552]  Correct.
[00:29:57.792 --> 00:30:00.514]  It's just like when I went down for her field trip.
[00:30:00.814 --> 00:30:01.835]  It was very uncomfortable.
[00:30:02.956 --> 00:30:06.338]  Like I was being a criminal just being there at that school district.
[00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:08.519]  It's very uncomfortable.
[00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:12.062]  So, I mean, I don't know.
[00:30:12.122 --> 00:30:13.202]  I just feel really bad.
[00:30:13.243 --> 00:30:14.083]  It's been emotional.
[00:30:14.123 --> 00:30:15.764]  Haley wrote me an apology letter.
[00:30:16.004 --> 00:30:16.945]  Now she feels like
[00:30:17.842 --> 00:30:19.745]  She did wrong.
[00:30:19.765 --> 00:30:20.907]  But it's not her fault.
[00:30:21.448 --> 00:30:24.513]  They told her at least twice, you're going to be in trouble.
[00:30:24.774 --> 00:30:26.276]  She kept saying, no, my grandma.
[00:30:26.597 --> 00:30:28.980]  They'd say, tell me the truth, your mother did that, didn't she?
[00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:31.745]  Your mother spanked you and she went.
[00:30:32.728 --> 00:30:34.249]  Yeah, I guess before I've been spying.
[00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:38.130]  And when I asked the CPS officer, I was like, so you saw bruises on my daughter?
[00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.051]  She said, yes.
[00:30:39.091 --> 00:30:42.392]  I go, that means you must have took her pants down, because I know what Haley wears to school.
[00:30:42.492 --> 00:30:46.054]  Yeah, you get a call first where you've been told by your daughter because they told your daughter not to tell you.
[00:30:46.414 --> 00:30:51.936]  And psychology studies show people rape kids and they won't tell their parents because they get scared.
[00:30:52.176 --> 00:30:52.997]  They're embarrassed.
[00:30:53.237 --> 00:30:55.958]  Yeah, so when I confronted her with that about
[00:30:56.418 --> 00:30:57.199]  We're good to go.
[00:31:21.244 --> 00:31:29.830]  No, I just think it was all wrong and I'm really upset that I wasn't notified Monday or Tuesday by the school, at least, you know.
[00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.311]  Oh, we're a little concerned.
[00:31:31.492 --> 00:31:35.274]  Something would have helped, not for me to get blindsided, slapped in the face.
[00:31:35.294 --> 00:31:37.816]  Well, they're not your friends and they operate outside the law.
[00:31:38.136 --> 00:31:42.079]  They are a eugenics organization and most of this trash doesn't even know what they're part of.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.642]  They're either control freaks or they're pedophiles or they're bounty hunters.
[00:31:46.743 --> 00:31:47.123]  That's it.
[00:31:48.518 --> 00:31:49.359]  50 plus percent leave.
[00:31:49.479 --> 00:31:51.964]  They get there, they're like the lady they called earlier, and they go, I'm not...
[00:31:53.547 --> 00:31:58.051]  We can handle the small percentage of real child endangerment and abuse with the police.
[00:31:58.512 --> 00:31:59.012]  Stay with us.
[00:31:59.052 --> 00:31:59.993]  The lawyer's coming up.
[00:32:00.273 --> 00:32:01.254]  We'll talk more antidepressants.
[00:32:01.274 --> 00:32:09.481]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:32:09.762 --> 00:32:14.166]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[00:32:14.606 --> 00:32:19.791]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[00:33:01.363 --> 00:33:06.688]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:33:07.188 --> 00:33:14.174]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:33:14.753 --> 00:33:20.936]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:33:21.296 --> 00:33:23.177]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:33:23.317 --> 00:33:25.738]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:33:25.818 --> 00:33:36.763]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:33:37.404 --> 00:33:38.685]  It's not about left or right.
[00:33:39.065 --> 00:33:40.445]  It's about a one world government.
[00:33:40.925 --> 00:33:47.228]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:33:47.828 --> 00:33:55.631]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:56.091 --> 00:33:57.251]  The Obama Deception.
[00:33:57.671 --> 00:33:58.852]  The people strike back.
[00:34:01.267 --> 00:34:06.752]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:34:06.772 --> 00:34:07.312]  and the world.
[00:34:07.573 --> 00:34:11.016]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:34:11.436 --> 00:34:17.661]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:34:17.941 --> 00:34:19.723]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:34:19.963 --> 00:34:27.910]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:34:27.910 --> 00:34:28.510]  I think so.
[00:34:43.476 --> 00:34:44.197]  We're good to go.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:09.923]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:35:10.584 --> 00:35:11.384]  You want answers?
[00:35:12.145 --> 00:35:13.085]  Well, so does he.
[00:35:13.105 --> 00:35:17.348]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:17.909 --> 00:35:22.012]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35:22.612 --> 00:35:26.315]  Look, I got the gun-grabbing news, the attacks on free speech news, everything.
[00:35:26.355 --> 00:35:34.461]  But this attack on the family, as the federal government has said over and over again, they're going to use the school to take over the family and take over society.
[00:35:37.389 --> 00:35:40.711]  Recommended by the National Child Abuse Defense Resource Center.
[00:35:40.731 --> 00:35:44.012]  Supposedly one of the best lawyers and family stuff in Texas.
[00:35:44.032 --> 00:35:46.393]  We've got about ten others now lined up too.
[00:35:47.734 --> 00:35:56.559]  We'll be joining us, Butch Brott from Houston, coming up a little bit later.
[00:35:56.599 --> 00:36:01.081]  And then I'm going to shift gears later in the hour and get into all the financial news.
[00:36:02.296 --> 00:36:05.941]  And police state news that is taking place out there.
[00:36:07.323 --> 00:36:19.538]  But I'm going to give the phone numbers out here in just a few minutes to the city council and the mayor in Buda, a little town just south of Austin.
[00:36:20.501 --> 00:36:23.242]  It's not so little anymore, it's exploding in size.
[00:36:23.262 --> 00:36:29.403]  And we're going to give you the number to the school, and we're going to give you the number to the county, and we're going to give you the number to the police department.
[00:36:29.423 --> 00:36:31.004]  In fact, give me the Buda Police Department number.
[00:36:31.024 --> 00:36:34.785]  I'm going to give these loathsome, loathsome people.
[00:36:35.625 --> 00:36:37.785]  It was Buda Police Department in there, or was it Hays County?
[00:36:38.926 --> 00:36:40.126]  Most likely Hays County.
[00:36:41.066 --> 00:36:44.047]  Again, they won't give you any info at the school or the CPS.
[00:36:44.147 --> 00:36:45.467]  They just say, we're coming to your house.
[00:36:45.527 --> 00:36:48.408]  I asked CPS and they're like, well, all that information is confidential.
[00:36:49.192 --> 00:36:50.232]  Yeah, that's all confidential.
[00:36:50.272 --> 00:36:56.014]  It's your kid, and we secretly strip-searched him, and we're doing all of this, but we're not going to tell you anything.
[00:36:56.494 --> 00:36:57.214]  Just trust us.
[00:36:57.714 --> 00:36:58.654]  Meet us at your house.
[00:36:58.694 --> 00:36:59.754]  No, I'll meet you at the gas station.
[00:36:59.794 --> 00:37:03.295]  You pull in, and there she is with the unmarked cop, waiting in the parking lot for you.
[00:37:04.035 --> 00:37:06.196]  I mean, just outrageous people.
[00:37:06.896 --> 00:37:08.377]  But you know, she was laughing at you and stuff.
[00:37:08.397 --> 00:37:09.337]  You're actually being real arrogant.
[00:37:09.357 --> 00:37:10.557]  She's not so arrogant now, is she?
[00:37:11.317 --> 00:37:11.737]  That's right.
[00:37:11.897 --> 00:37:13.038]  I asked her for her phone number.
[00:37:13.118 --> 00:37:17.179]  She kind of chuckled and gave me a number that's been going to voicemail.
[00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:18.859]  She's calling me private.
[00:37:20.689 --> 00:37:23.171]  So, we haven't really spoken to her.
[00:37:23.191 --> 00:37:30.218]  Her name is Nicole Pulver, P-U-L-V-E-R, and we've got those numbers there.
[00:37:30.258 --> 00:37:33.641]  We need the lawyers to be able to call them later so I know I should give out the CPS numbers.
[00:37:34.042 --> 00:37:34.983]  Literally, we'll shut them down.
[00:37:35.223 --> 00:37:36.224]  These are important calls.
[00:37:36.244 --> 00:37:37.525]  I need every listener.
[00:37:38.406 --> 00:37:41.389]  This affects everybody out there, not just us here in Austin, Texas.
[00:37:41.409 --> 00:37:42.570]  This is a case point example.
[00:37:43.407 --> 00:37:45.328]  I mean, think about what we've been trained to put up with.
[00:37:45.428 --> 00:37:49.571]  They take every kid in, guilty until proven innocent, do a big drag net.
[00:37:50.071 --> 00:37:53.493]  This is worse than, you know, tapping people's phones, you know, just fishing expedition.
[00:37:53.913 --> 00:37:54.694]  It's totally illegal.
[00:37:55.534 --> 00:37:57.055]  They drag them in, they question them.
[00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:58.556]  They do this all over the country.
[00:37:59.036 --> 00:38:00.477]  They got quotas of kids they want to get.
[00:38:00.497 --> 00:38:02.078]  There's a bruise on her leg, they can see.
[00:38:02.559 --> 00:38:04.600]  So they use that and say, your mom did that, didn't you?
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.400]  Well, no.
[00:38:06.241 --> 00:38:07.301]  Well, does your mom ever spank you?
[00:38:07.381 --> 00:38:09.803]  Well, I guess, sometimes or once in a while.
[00:38:09.883 --> 00:38:11.264]  You know, spanking isn't illegal.
[00:38:11.524 --> 00:38:12.645]  Back when I was in high school,
[00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:15.270]  On junior high, I was getting pops every month.
[00:38:15.956 --> 00:38:21.397]  I'd get in a fight, I'd smart out to the teacher, and the principal would, you know, put bruises on me.
[00:38:21.737 --> 00:38:22.137]  And you know what?
[00:38:22.237 --> 00:38:23.317]  That got my attention.
[00:38:23.578 --> 00:38:26.718]  But see, the police taser you when you don't do something, and sometimes people are out of control.
[00:38:27.278 --> 00:38:30.639]  Or society does all this, but no, parents can't, even though it's not a law.
[00:38:30.779 --> 00:38:32.339]  It's like they'll take your kids for not vaccinating.
[00:38:32.359 --> 00:38:32.759]  There's no law.
[00:38:32.779 --> 00:38:35.000]  I mean, in the other comments, what's it been like for you, Joe?
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:45.522]  Because, you know, with your former wife and your kids, and I've talked to Mike Nelson here and everybody in the office who has kids, I guess being in public school, this is just normal, even when you're 15-year-olds now.
[00:38:45.822 --> 00:38:47.623]  Have bruises from football, they try to take them.
[00:38:48.003 --> 00:38:53.386]  Oh yeah, it's very... even in Del Valle, they do the same thing down there.
[00:38:53.446 --> 00:38:56.727]  I get calls that my son Joe has a bruise on his arm.
[00:38:57.308 --> 00:38:58.228]  It's all horseplay.
[00:38:59.028 --> 00:39:00.909]  They want to know if we wrestle, we do this.
[00:39:00.949 --> 00:39:01.950]  Well, you know, we're guys.
[00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:03.571]  We're going to be playing around.
[00:39:03.631 --> 00:39:08.073]  It's very stressful to have to put up with people like this already.
[00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.514]  Control freak secret agents.
[00:39:10.874 --> 00:39:13.976]  Yes, and we need somebody or the governor.
[00:39:13.996 --> 00:39:15.737]  I mean, they're not doing nothing for us.
[00:39:16.417 --> 00:39:18.499]  Ourselves as citizens, we have to do something.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.941]  Slavery is a lucrative business.
[00:39:23.462 --> 00:39:24.402]  Slavery is still around today.
[00:39:24.422 --> 00:39:25.923]  They catch you smoking pot, you're a slave.
[00:39:26.243 --> 00:39:28.245]  They catch a bruise on your kid, they're a slave.
[00:39:28.685 --> 00:39:31.667]  It's all about money, but they are passing laws
[00:39:32.347 --> 00:39:37.448]  Federal appeals court with the authority over Texas handed down a decision and case that will refer to the Gates case.
[00:39:37.748 --> 00:39:46.890]  The decision is binding on Texas because it involves federal constitutional rights, supersedes anything contrary to Texas law, the DFPH policy practices.
[00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:51.210]  And this is when, with one complaint, they go and grab whole families and just never see them again.
[00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:56.931]  And then they've had to pass state laws explaining to CPS in Texas and nationwide, it's not illegal to homeschool.
[00:39:57.452 --> 00:39:59.552]  You know why most of the groups fighting CPS are homeschoolers?
[00:40:00.407 --> 00:40:02.311]  Because they take your kids.
[00:40:03.553 --> 00:40:04.254]  They don't care.
[00:40:04.274 --> 00:40:09.264]  Anything else you guys need to add?
[00:40:10.346 --> 00:40:10.486]  No.
[00:40:13.371 --> 00:40:13.852]  Stay here.
[00:40:13.912 --> 00:40:16.214]  I want to bring up one of the lawyers that came highly recommended.
[00:40:16.234 --> 00:40:17.775]  We've talked to 10 today so far.
[00:40:17.795 --> 00:40:18.736]  They're in there calling more.
[00:40:18.776 --> 00:40:20.218]  I know a lot of organizations out there.
[00:40:20.258 --> 00:40:23.801]  The National Child Abuse Defense Resource Center recommended in Texas.
[00:40:24.602 --> 00:40:26.383]  Butch Brott has the best.
[00:40:26.543 --> 00:40:27.725]  And I think we're going to go with him.
[00:40:27.845 --> 00:40:28.665]  Give him that $2,000 retainer.
[00:40:28.706 --> 00:40:29.867]  I'm going to pay for that.
[00:40:30.487 --> 00:40:32.829]  And then today we've got to figure out how you can do a phone bridge.
[00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:38.857]  Or if we should talk to the CPS, but they're saying they'll talk to you, because I've called today, or they'll talk to your lawyer.
[00:40:39.739 --> 00:40:49.933]  My dad, who's a physician, recommended, as the other lawyer filings do, to go to a physician to show she's not hurt, or they'll try to go get an order claiming she's hurt from a tiny bruise on her leg from a table.
[00:40:51.471 --> 00:40:55.073]  And, uh, you went to the doctor and they said, yeah, she's not hurt.
[00:40:55.273 --> 00:40:58.335]  I'll give you the receipt, but I'll only give CPS a report saying she's fine.
[00:40:58.575 --> 00:40:59.696]  That's your medical record.
[00:41:00.296 --> 00:41:03.298]  So we'll have to get the lawyer to call them and say, release it to me.
[00:41:03.558 --> 00:41:09.522]  But, but, but, uh, tell us about the doctor's visit and then in one minute we're going to go to, uh, Mr. Brott.
[00:41:09.982 --> 00:41:10.242]  Okay.
[00:41:10.423 --> 00:41:13.745]  I, um, went and got the health check, well checked.
[00:41:13.765 --> 00:41:14.945]  She said everything was fine.
[00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:19.968]  Um, Haley said where she got the bruise from, everything was consistent with the stories.
[00:41:20.949 --> 00:41:21.029]  Um,
[00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:27.092]  So as I was getting ready to leave, I asked if I could have a report of everything documented, and she said, no.
[00:41:27.493 --> 00:41:30.274]  If anybody needed it, they would have to request for it.
[00:41:30.934 --> 00:41:33.075]  So you as a parent, again, we have no rights.
[00:41:33.115 --> 00:41:34.316]  The whole system is like this.
[00:41:34.976 --> 00:41:38.258]  We're trash, we're scum, we're filth, we're nobody.
[00:41:38.318 --> 00:41:39.238]  We just pay the money.
[00:41:39.658 --> 00:41:41.419]  We just produce the kids for them to snatch them.
[00:41:41.759 --> 00:41:43.560]  We just pay the taxes for the war machine.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.361]  We're just here to be slaves.
[00:41:46.041 --> 00:41:49.404]  She's supposed to give you the well check slip, the thing she filled out.
[00:41:49.604 --> 00:41:53.107]  So we'll have the lawyer call them.
[00:41:53.567 --> 00:41:58.531]  Let's go ahead and let's go to the attorney, Butch Barat.
[00:41:58.991 --> 00:42:01.013]  Butch, thanks for coming on on such short notice, sir.
[00:42:01.033 --> 00:42:02.594]  It's my pleasure, Alex.
[00:42:03.275 --> 00:42:06.337]  I know you've seen this a million times.
[00:42:06.738 --> 00:42:11.942]  Did my producer recount the story to you or do you want us to recount that for you so you can give us your take on it?
[00:42:12.538 --> 00:42:16.039]  Rob and Janet gave me what happened.
[00:42:16.619 --> 00:42:18.059]  So I'm familiar with the facts.
[00:42:18.339 --> 00:42:24.020]  Okay, give us your take on this because you come highly recommended.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.100]  Where do you start?
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:40.343]  From the standpoint of everybody has to understand that the state of Texas and all of the other states have made a pact with the devil when they subscribed to the federal money back in the 70s under the Mondale Act.
[00:42:41.264 --> 00:42:48.866]  And that deal was, we'll give you federal money for CPS as long as you provide these people immunity.
[00:42:49.947 --> 00:42:51.927]  And it's gone downhill ever since.
[00:42:53.568 --> 00:43:00.010]  They have absolute immunity, virtually absolute immunity, if they say there's abuse.
[00:43:01.201 --> 00:43:04.624]  The doctors have immunity if they report abuse.
[00:43:04.824 --> 00:43:07.947]  They don't have immunity if they say they don't report abuse.
[00:43:08.107 --> 00:43:17.654]  So everything's geared for the tattletale society, and so now when I'm at the hospital having a baby, they ask my wife if I'm abusing her and put it in a database with the health department.
[00:43:17.674 --> 00:43:19.936]  I mean, this is the total Stasi society.
[00:43:21.798 --> 00:43:24.180]  That's a very apt way of describing it.
[00:43:26.101 --> 00:43:30.745]  Nothing proves that nothing happened, but nothing proves that something happened.
[00:43:31.733 --> 00:43:33.713]  It's that backwards.
[00:43:35.374 --> 00:43:36.674]  Now what if it's official oppression?
[00:43:36.694 --> 00:43:38.154]  What if they operate outside their office?
[00:43:38.354 --> 00:43:39.655]  I mean, they did strip search her.
[00:43:41.575 --> 00:43:47.756]  That has to do with the police and whether that is proper protocol or not.
[00:43:48.056 --> 00:43:55.678]  I have a real serious problem with a male police officer strip searching a female child.
[00:43:56.718 --> 00:43:57.538]  Or any female.
[00:43:58.257 --> 00:44:01.379]  Well, regardless, if they wanted to strip search an adult, they'd have to get a warrant.
[00:44:01.419 --> 00:44:05.440]  I mean, I know they set up these eugenics courts in the 20s and the Mondale Act and the Clinton in 97.
[00:44:06.121 --> 00:44:10.963]  I know we've gone down this road of these fake courts, but this is just amazing.
[00:44:11.003 --> 00:44:16.186]  And then telling her over and over again, tell the truth, no, your mother did this, that's despicable.
[00:44:16.786 --> 00:44:18.207]  Well, it's beyond despicable.
[00:44:19.147 --> 00:44:25.130]  The book Jeopardy in the Courtroom by Maggie Brooke and Stephen Ceci shows
[00:44:25.988 --> 00:44:28.708]  How easy it is to corrupt a child's recollection.
[00:44:29.329 --> 00:44:35.850]  A child is going to respond to an authority figure and give them what answer they expect.
[00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:40.291]  It takes a very strong child to stand up and say no.
[00:44:41.891 --> 00:44:44.051]  Especially when they come in wearing a uniform and a badge.
[00:44:44.731 --> 00:44:47.012]  You know, God bless her daughter for saying no.
[00:44:47.252 --> 00:44:47.972]  Nothing happened.
[00:44:48.932 --> 00:44:50.752]  But no, that is improper interrogation.
[00:44:50.792 --> 00:44:51.692]  It should not happen.
[00:44:52.453 --> 00:44:54.453]  I have already advised
[00:44:55.555 --> 00:45:15.582]  Janet to make a laminated card for her children to carry around saying I do not want to talk or say anything without my parent being here or my lawyer being here put her name and phone number on it and if necessary put it on a lanyard so the child can wear it around her neck.
[00:45:16.723 --> 00:45:17.823]  That to me is abhorrent.
[00:45:18.524 --> 00:45:30.766]  Well, just to finish up in case they didn't relay this to you, they told her twice, maybe three times, we're not sure, no, your mother did that bruise, did that bruise, until she said, okay, I guess she did, but it's on record that they told her to say it.
[00:45:31.646 --> 00:45:37.208]  Expanding on that, Monday, they see the bruise, because it's pajama day, wearing shorts at the school.
[00:45:37.748 --> 00:45:40.048]  Tuesday, they told her, don't tell your mother.
[00:45:40.468 --> 00:45:44.129]  Tuesday, they call her, tell her, we want to go to your house while our kid's at school.
[00:45:45.449 --> 00:45:46.950]  Uh, I tell her, you know, this may not be a good idea.
[00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:48.111]  They want to get in your house and look for stuff.
[00:45:48.131 --> 00:45:49.172]  We need to talk to a lawyer first.
[00:45:49.512 --> 00:45:51.173]  So she said, okay, let me meet her at a gas station.
[00:45:51.493 --> 00:45:52.914]  I told her, is she with a cop?
[00:45:52.954 --> 00:45:56.016]  They drive through, there's an unmarked cop car with a cop, with a woman.
[00:45:56.336 --> 00:45:57.777]  She leaves, says, are you there?
[00:45:57.797 --> 00:45:58.637]  They're like, yeah, we're here.
[00:45:58.977 --> 00:46:02.239]  So it looks like they may be to the point of grabbing her daughter or something.
[00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:03.620]  What does it sound like to you, Mr. Broad?
[00:46:04.401 --> 00:46:05.822]  Well, please, it's Butch.
[00:46:06.402 --> 00:46:10.144]  But secondly, force them to make the mistake.
[00:46:12.085 --> 00:46:13.066]  Make them commit
[00:46:13.686 --> 00:46:15.087]  to something that's illegal.
[00:46:16.327 --> 00:46:19.549]  They show up at your door and they want in, where's your search warrant?
[00:46:20.189 --> 00:46:24.571]  They show up at your door and they want your child, where's your search warrant?
[00:46:25.291 --> 00:46:26.952]  Force them to make the mistake.
[00:46:28.372 --> 00:46:33.355]  If you haven't done anything wrong, insist upon that search warrant.
[00:46:33.735 --> 00:46:35.596]  Yeah, because they'll trick their way in like a vampire.
[00:46:35.636 --> 00:46:36.116]  Let me in.
[00:46:36.436 --> 00:46:36.896]  It'll be all right.
[00:46:36.916 --> 00:46:37.516]  Just let me in.
[00:46:38.117 --> 00:46:38.677]  Absolutely.
[00:46:38.757 --> 00:46:41.378]  And a small consent becomes a global consent.
[00:46:41.438 --> 00:46:42.579]  And then it's a swearing match.
[00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:43.299]  Who said what?
[00:46:45.871 --> 00:46:48.173]  So I gave them the right advice not to go meet them?
[00:46:48.834 --> 00:46:49.354]  Absolutely.
[00:46:49.474 --> 00:46:51.696]  I never advise my clients to meet with them.
[00:46:51.716 --> 00:46:55.640]  Alright, stay there Mr. Borat Butch.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.922]  Butch Borat, attorney at law joining us from Houston.
[00:46:58.443 --> 00:46:59.083]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:11.054]  With food prices soaring to all time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:47:14.292 --> 00:47:14.592]  I think so.
[00:47:42.489 --> 00:47:46.132]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden In A Can.

[00:47:50.055 --> 00:47:50.795]  That's GardenInACan.com.
[00:47:50.815 --> 00:47:51.236]  Or call 866-598-7396.
[00:47:51.256 --> 00:47:51.296]  866-598-7396.
[00:47:51.316 --> 00:47:54.879]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:48:06.597 --> 00:48:11.940]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:18.683]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:48:18.983 --> 00:48:20.784]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:48:20.964 --> 00:48:23.325]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:48:23.406 --> 00:48:34.291]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:48:36.582 --> 00:48:37.842]  It's not about left or right.
[00:48:38.262 --> 00:48:39.663]  It's about a one world government.
[00:48:40.123 --> 00:48:46.464]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:48:55.286 --> 00:48:56.447]  The Obama Deception.
[00:48:56.847 --> 00:48:58.047]  The people strike back.
[00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:01.251]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:49:01.431 --> 00:49:01.771]  May 20th, 2009.
[00:49:01.811 --> 00:49:02.631]  Gold opened this morning at $9.3170.
[00:49:02.672 --> 00:49:05.753]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.5849, $4.7925 for a half-ounce, or $2.3962 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:49:05.773 --> 00:49:06.213]  That's $9.5849, $4.7925, or $2.3962.
[00:49:18.019 --> 00:49:30.070]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:33.292]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:49:33.393 --> 00:49:36.655]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:49:36.735 --> 00:49:39.558]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:49:39.798 --> 00:49:42.501]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:49:42.561 --> 00:49:45.284]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:49:45.484 --> 00:49:47.527]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:49:47.647 --> 00:49:49.909]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.254]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:49:54.294 --> 00:49:54.475]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:49:59.943 --> 00:50:02.327]  Are you concerned for the safety of your loved ones?
[00:50:02.627 --> 00:50:05.812]  Listen closely to this message from Pepperspray.com.
[00:50:06.253 --> 00:50:13.544]  Every 22 seconds a violent crime is committed, America has changed, and your personal safety is your first priority.
[00:50:13.845 --> 00:50:14.466]  Be smart.
[00:50:14.666 --> 00:50:15.247]  Be safe.
[00:50:15.607 --> 00:50:17.948]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.
[00:50:18.208 --> 00:50:24.490]  Pepperspray.com is the only website you'll ever need for all of your non-lethal self-defense supplies.
[00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:30.552]  Pepperspray.com carries one of the largest assortments of pepper spray and personal safety products on the web.
[00:50:30.772 --> 00:50:33.213]  From big to small, we have it all.
[00:50:33.453 --> 00:50:37.255]  Pepper spray, mace, animal repellents, stun guns, and tasers.
[00:50:37.495 --> 00:50:43.857]  Pepperspray.com also carries a large assortment of products for personal, home, child, and pet safety.
[00:50:44.697 --> 00:50:45.378]  We're good to go.
[00:51:06.903 --> 00:51:09.466]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[00:51:09.506 --> 00:51:11.828]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[00:51:11.908 --> 00:51:14.871]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[00:51:14.931 --> 00:51:17.974]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lip to Big John.
[00:51:18.014 --> 00:51:19.235]  Much broad.
[00:51:19.335 --> 00:51:23.639]  On top of this, her fiancé has several other children with his ex-wife.
[00:51:24.537 --> 00:51:25.759]  Who live nearby.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.204]  And when they were calling Janet yesterday, she was saying, and I want those other children.
[00:51:30.265 --> 00:51:31.366]  I want to know where they live.
[00:51:31.686 --> 00:51:38.395]  So I guess they were wanting to kind of, you know, meet their quota with children that don't even live in the same house.
[00:51:41.145 --> 00:51:43.666]  Your comments on that, sir, and where should this go?
[00:51:43.706 --> 00:51:47.467]  I mean, did she put her daughter back in the government training center so they grab her?
[00:51:49.428 --> 00:51:51.189]  You know, why were they taking photos?
[00:51:51.229 --> 00:51:52.869]  Are the police planning to arrest Janet?
[00:51:52.889 --> 00:51:56.390]  I mean, I guess later the CPS worker said she would talk to you.
[00:51:56.771 --> 00:51:58.971]  Certainly you've advised Janet not to meet with them.
[00:51:59.091 --> 00:52:00.692]  I mean, what's the course of action here?
[00:52:01.652 --> 00:52:04.753]  Well, I am shocked that you would say they have a quota.
[00:52:04.833 --> 00:52:05.254]  They don't.
[00:52:05.314 --> 00:52:08.995]  They can destroy as many families as they can get a hold of.
[00:52:10.678 --> 00:52:11.698]  So it's worse than that?
[00:52:12.299 --> 00:52:13.819]  Yeah.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:23.103]  And obviously part of their system, even though they deny it, is how many cases they open and close.
[00:52:27.044 --> 00:52:33.606]  It is hard to believe in the United States of America that as far as men, we are all perverts.
[00:52:33.806 --> 00:52:35.247]  We just haven't all been caught.
[00:52:36.848 --> 00:52:38.028]  As far as families,
[00:52:39.301 --> 00:52:40.582]  They're all abuse factories.
[00:52:40.642 --> 00:52:42.063]  They all haven't been exposed.
[00:52:42.464 --> 00:52:49.609]  I don't know how they expect us to have families or raise children or so forth, other than in state-run institutions.
[00:52:49.709 --> 00:52:50.350]  Well, no, sir.
[00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:55.574]  Have you seen the, I mean, we've posted these, the textbooks that they give all the CPS workers in college?
[00:52:55.614 --> 00:52:58.256]  It says, quote, the family is a disease.
[00:53:00.418 --> 00:53:01.939]  I have not seen the textbook.
[00:53:02.059 --> 00:53:04.081]  I am aware of this mindset.
[00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:18.973]  That they are of the firm opinion that the state of Texas, or whichever state you happen to be in, is better suited to raise your child, your children, and teach them morals and values than you are.
[00:53:20.434 --> 00:53:22.294]  And that, to me, is abhorrent.
[00:53:22.894 --> 00:53:28.336]  It is so twisted as to beggar, you know, comprehension.
[00:53:28.696 --> 00:53:30.577]  I don't know how you get there.
[00:53:32.108 --> 00:53:36.349]  As far as what is the next step, they're going to snoop around trying to find something.
[00:53:37.089 --> 00:53:44.931]  Again, their mindset is just because nothing happened, that there's no evidence, doesn't mean something didn't happen.
[00:53:45.071 --> 00:53:55.253]  There are doctors who testify in these cases who say because there's no physical evidence, a percentage of cases there can be rape without any physical evidence.
[00:53:56.753 --> 00:53:59.314]  Beyond me to understand, I have actually
[00:54:00.017 --> 00:54:03.462]  Heard a doctor give a presentation that the hymen grows back.
[00:54:04.703 --> 00:54:08.328]  And that supposedly this doctor had photographic proof of this.
[00:54:08.569 --> 00:54:11.673]  Has never been published, but that's their mindset.
[00:54:15.968 --> 00:54:19.889]  And how do they get the nurses and doctors, I guess if they're forced to do it, they get to where they like it.
[00:54:20.529 --> 00:54:25.371]  I mean, to go have a baby now is like entering a Nazi interrogation chamber.
[00:54:25.931 --> 00:54:32.993]  I mean, everything is interrogation, everything is tattletales, everything is... I have news articles where they're training seven-year-olds to spy on their parents.
[00:54:33.033 --> 00:54:34.714]  I mean, it's just... It's hellish!
[00:54:35.154 --> 00:54:36.014]  It's East Germany!
[00:54:37.655 --> 00:54:38.275]  Absolutely.
[00:54:39.935 --> 00:54:43.296]  How do you train the doctors this way?
[00:54:43.817 --> 00:54:44.817]  It's very easy.
[00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:50.271]  You give them absolute immunity if they report abuse.
[00:54:50.591 --> 00:54:54.893]  You give them no immunity and civil liability if they don't.
[00:54:55.373 --> 00:54:56.553]  That's a no-brainer.
[00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:59.194]  What about how now they ask everybody, do you own a gun?
[00:54:59.214 --> 00:55:00.075]  Do you have children?
[00:55:00.295 --> 00:55:05.037]  You'll go in to have your broken finger fixed and their little secret police asking you, do you have guns in your house?
[00:55:05.077 --> 00:55:08.858]  And then not telling you, by the way, we're filing this with a criminal agency.
[00:55:08.918 --> 00:55:09.959]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:12.820]  The answer to that one is, it's none of your business.
[00:55:13.735 --> 00:55:16.237]  There is no illegal activity going on in my house.
[00:55:16.357 --> 00:55:16.698]  Period.
[00:55:16.738 --> 00:55:17.278]  End of story.
[00:55:17.318 --> 00:55:19.440]  Why don't you ask the doctor, hey, do you own any guns?
[00:55:20.481 --> 00:55:22.042]  Do you visit Hooker's doctor?
[00:55:22.062 --> 00:55:25.705]  You know, I mean, you know, he'd be like, how dare you get out of here?
[00:55:25.945 --> 00:55:27.747]  But it's normal for him to do it.
[00:55:28.588 --> 00:55:31.250]  Well, because they're trained this way, unfortunately.
[00:55:32.131 --> 00:55:34.372]  And yes, do they see actual abuse?
[00:55:34.653 --> 00:55:35.173]  You bet.
[00:55:36.194 --> 00:55:41.959]  Several years ago at Thanksgiving, my wife happened to trip on a long skirt, fell down.
[00:55:42.757 --> 00:55:43.719]  And broker knows.
[00:55:44.059 --> 00:55:45.681]  I took her to the emergency room.
[00:55:46.262 --> 00:55:47.544]  I become the suspect.
[00:55:48.605 --> 00:55:51.009]  Excuse me, I've got 25 witnesses at home.
[00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:53.250]  Go talk to them.
[00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:54.851]  Take care of my wife.
[00:55:54.911 --> 00:56:11.474]  Well, I was about to say, sir, I've seen the cases where people I know, I mean, well-to-do families come to my door, neighbors, you know, middle class, and say, you know, I know your show's about this stuff, you know, my daughter in front of witnesses at the playground broke her finger and they're trying to take her and they don't even want to see my witnesses.
[00:56:12.014 --> 00:56:13.155]  No, they want your kid!
[00:56:13.175 --> 00:56:14.195]  That's right.
[00:56:14.475 --> 00:56:18.716]  They got a jet to fly her to Saudi Arabia, she's ten years old, she's got blonde hair, it's over.
[00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:23.932]  And surprisingly, the number of kids who get snatched that fit that description.
[00:56:25.373 --> 00:56:26.294]  Alright, so stay there.
[00:56:26.354 --> 00:56:37.059]  I want to hear in just five more minutes on the other side that we're going to have Kim Hard, Executive Director, National Child Abuse Defense and Resource Center, who recommended you, is going to come up in about five minutes after that.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:43.463]  And I'll give the phone numbers out to the Buda School District, the Buda Police Department, the Hays County Sheriff's Department, and the City Council.
[00:56:43.883 --> 00:56:48.926]  I want you to call these people and let them know we're fully aware of their sickening activities.
[00:56:51.232 --> 00:56:54.213]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:56:55.153 --> 00:56:57.893]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:00.814 --> 00:57:02.414]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:02.514 --> 00:57:07.135]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:57:07.255 --> 00:57:10.016]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:57:10.216 --> 00:57:13.076]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:57:13.276 --> 00:57:17.977]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:57:18.217 --> 00:57:19.138]  If you simply prepare.
[00:57:19.338 --> 00:57:22.300]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:29.484]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:57:29.585 --> 00:57:32.707]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:57:32.847 --> 00:57:34.728]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:41.011]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:07.336 --> 00:58:14.381]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:14.901 --> 00:58:21.105]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:21.426 --> 00:58:23.327]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:23.467 --> 00:58:25.889]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:36.936]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:37.538 --> 00:58:38.839]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:39.219 --> 00:58:40.599]  It's about a one world government.
[00:58:41.059 --> 00:58:47.402]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:58:47.982 --> 00:58:55.765]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:56.245 --> 00:58:57.385]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:57.805 --> 00:58:58.986]  The people strike back.
[00:59:01.528 --> 00:59:10.273]  Ioniczone.com sells virus, bacteria, and mold-killing products that will protect you and your loved ones from airborne pathogens, biological threats, chemtrails, you name it.

[00:59:36.849 --> 00:59:42.033]  Naturopath recommended Super Zeolite for heavy metal detox, even an ozone handheld bidet.

[01:00:04.997 --> 01:00:07.278]  Ladies and gentlemen, are you next?
[01:00:07.958 --> 01:00:10.078]  Mainstream news admits they're creating youth brigades.
[01:00:10.118 --> 01:00:13.419]  New York Times says kids are tattling on their parents for taking a bath.
[01:00:14.159 --> 01:00:16.380]  It's not illegal, but they say it's bad for the carbon footprint.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.140]  They're creating youth brigades.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.061]  They've got seven-year-olds spying on people.
[01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:21.481]  This is in the news.
[01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:23.722]  This is the government taking over society.
[01:00:24.322 --> 01:00:28.283]  They grab masses of kids, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands every year.
[01:00:29.668 --> 01:00:33.769]  When they end up killing him in their custody, five times more likely to abuse him than any other group, nothing happens.
[01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:36.610]  You better care about this, folks, and become informed.
[01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:44.853]  Now, two final questions for you, sir, and then I'll get off air and let you start advising Janet and Joe what they should do with Haley here.
[01:00:46.397 --> 01:00:48.199]  But it does seem the worm is turning.
[01:00:48.219 --> 01:01:07.055]  You know, the Texas Youth Commission and all the mass rapings they were doing, the government, and all over the country, it seems despite all the CPS industry and the Child Protective Services propaganda and the federal propaganda, people know these are ghouls now, and that for every one good thing they do, they do probably a hundred bad, and they violate due process.
[01:01:07.395 --> 01:01:09.377]  I mean, is the worm starting to turn?
[01:01:09.437 --> 01:01:10.178]  Some good news here?
[01:01:11.596 --> 01:01:16.460]  The worm is starting to turn because people like you, Alex, are focusing the spotlight on it.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:24.125]  Unfortunately, too many people have the assumption that, gee, it can't happen to me, so why should I be concerned?
[01:01:25.846 --> 01:01:29.509]  Well, it's going to happen to you, directly or indirectly.
[01:01:29.709 --> 01:01:36.794]  It's going to happen to you and your kids, or you and your grandkids, or your children and their kids.
[01:01:37.555 --> 01:01:38.636]  It's going to affect you.
[01:01:39.375 --> 01:01:40.956]  And you need to know your rights.
[01:01:41.016 --> 01:01:42.677]  You don't talk to these people.
[01:01:43.738 --> 01:01:51.343]  I have a videotape of a CPS interview of a three-year-old boy from 1987.
[01:01:53.805 --> 01:02:02.551]  Four times in a row, CPS caseworker asked this boy, did your daddy do these horrible things to you?
[01:02:02.611 --> 01:02:06.094]  And four times in a row, the child denies it.
[01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:14.515]  Caseworker, on the videotape, takes the child, sits her on her lap, rubs his crotch, he goes nuts, wets himself.
[01:02:15.756 --> 01:02:17.117]  She repeats the questions.
[01:02:17.457 --> 01:02:18.818]  He changes his answers.
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:25.844]  She asks him, then realizing he's wet himself, what you just told me, is it the truth or a lie?
[01:02:26.244 --> 01:02:31.808]  He spins around, looks right at the camera, and says it's a lie, and they went out and got an indictment.
[01:02:33.032 --> 01:02:34.493]  Which ultimately was dismissed.
[01:02:34.693 --> 01:02:42.861]  So excuse me, you're saying on record, and I've seen the famous cases where they tell them, this is what he did to you, now show me, and they do it real happy like with a clown.
[01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:44.442]  Show me, this is how you did it!
[01:02:44.462 --> 01:02:45.403]  And they do it over and over again.
[01:02:45.723 --> 01:02:49.827]  You're saying they now do sexual abuse on the children on camera, and that's okay?
[01:02:50.287 --> 01:02:56.072]  1987, on the videotape, they take this three-year-old boy after they ask him four times in a row.
[01:02:56.693 --> 01:02:57.654]  Well, they're pedophiles!
[01:02:57.674 --> 01:02:59.075]  How many of these guys are pedophiles?
[01:02:59.135 --> 01:02:59.896]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:03:01.172 --> 01:03:03.313]  Go ahead and finish your story and then I'm going to ask you the question.
[01:03:16.934 --> 01:03:17.635]  Horse hockey.
[01:03:17.775 --> 01:03:21.879]  But wait a minute, now the pedophiles on camera sexually abuse the children and that's good?
[01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:23.060]  I mean, that's how crazy they're getting?
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:24.201]  That was 1987.
[01:03:25.122 --> 01:03:26.783]  Lord knows what they're doing today.
[01:03:26.983 --> 01:03:28.164]  How many of them are pedophiles?
[01:03:28.184 --> 01:03:29.726]  Because they're always getting busted and caught.
[01:03:29.986 --> 01:03:32.528]  We know the pedophiles get into this so they can have access to kids.
[01:03:33.289 --> 01:03:35.031]  And of course, they let the foster parents abuse them.
[01:03:35.051 --> 01:03:37.293]  That's where the smart pedophiles become foster parents.
[01:03:37.933 --> 01:03:40.896]  What percentage... I have no idea, Alex.
[01:03:41.076 --> 01:03:42.858]  I have no idea, but I know that
[01:03:44.289 --> 01:03:50.716]  The vast, vast majority of the ones that I have dealt with come from dysfunctional families.
[01:03:51.477 --> 01:03:53.199]  They are dysfunctional themselves.
[01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:59.026]  They have no idea what a normal relationship is with a child or with a wife or husband.
[01:04:00.862 --> 01:04:02.063]  Well, I've been around them a lot.
[01:04:02.083 --> 01:04:02.583]  I've fought them.
[01:04:02.763 --> 01:04:05.384]  And it's always, the guys are like the Nelly effeminate.
[01:04:05.784 --> 01:04:08.465]  I call it, you know, the Android pedophile model.
[01:04:08.485 --> 01:04:09.366]  You know what I'm talking about.
[01:04:09.406 --> 01:04:09.906]  You've fought them.
[01:04:10.366 --> 01:04:12.627]  And then the women are the butch with the haircut all crazed.
[01:04:12.927 --> 01:04:14.448]  I mean, is that not what you've seen with these people?
[01:04:15.708 --> 01:04:19.610]  By and large, if I had to say there's a stereotype, you pretty well pegged it.
[01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:22.411]  Yeah, fat Nelly, homosexual, and a butch.
[01:04:22.772 --> 01:04:25.853]  And then they don't like heterosexual families with kids, and they're waging war.
[01:04:26.313 --> 01:04:30.315]  And I'm not bashing gay people, but stop trying to steal our kids in your demon guilds.
[01:04:31.448 --> 01:04:32.248]  I mean, there, I've said it.
[01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:34.370]  I've just laid it right out, Counselor.
[01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:40.513]  Well, you will not get any argument from me that they are dysfunctional on more levels than one.
[01:04:42.114 --> 01:04:44.856]  And go find the real criminals.
[01:04:45.776 --> 01:04:48.938]  Don't try to indoctrinate them by putting them into your custody.
[01:04:49.038 --> 01:04:51.500]  But see, that's what these Nelly scumbags like.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.181]  They love the drama of tearing families apart.
[01:04:54.221 --> 01:04:55.302]  They love the power.
[01:04:56.202 --> 01:04:57.323]  And I'm declaring war on them.
[01:04:58.254 --> 01:04:59.715]  There's no question they like the power.
[01:05:00.015 --> 01:05:05.920]  They get paid a relatively low salary, and they have the infinite ability to destroy people's lives.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:07.121]  Yeah, well we're coming after them.
[01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:08.882]  I mean, if you carry the power trip, that's it.
[01:05:11.084 --> 01:05:11.284]  Yeah.
[01:05:12.024 --> 01:05:13.045]  And again, I've just fought them.
[01:05:13.065 --> 01:05:13.526]  I've seen it.
[01:05:13.546 --> 01:05:16.167]  I've never seen it where it's not those.
[01:05:16.908 --> 01:05:18.009]  I mean, it's what it is.
[01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:24.053]  It'll be a weird, chubby, nelly guy with a demonic face, you know, smiling.
[01:05:24.113 --> 01:05:25.935]  I mean, let me try to make the face for the TV crowd.
[01:05:27.816 --> 01:05:30.337]  And then the woman is like some angry, you know, demon.
[01:05:30.357 --> 01:05:31.357]  I don't know how to explain it.
[01:05:32.078 --> 01:05:35.219]  I have been dealing with cases involving CPS since 1982.
[01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:46.663]  And in that period of time, I can recall one caseworker that impressed me as coming from a functional family having a normal psychological makeup.
[01:05:48.504 --> 01:05:48.584]  One.
[01:05:49.659 --> 01:05:51.660]  Yeah, so they're either perverts or they're pirates.
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.441]  They're people that just want the money, and they get the bonuses for more kids.
[01:05:54.481 --> 01:05:58.582]  I want to go to bring Kim Hart up, and stay there if you can, Mr. Brott.
[01:05:58.923 --> 01:06:05.905]  I want to bring Kim Hart up, Executive Director, National Child Abuse Defense and Resource Center that recommended you, falseallegation.org.
[01:06:06.165 --> 01:06:07.706]  What is your comments about this, ma'am?
[01:06:08.886 --> 01:06:11.567]  Well, the problem that we have is social services.
[01:06:11.647 --> 01:06:13.148]  Oh, by the way, hello, Mr. Brott.
[01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:18.250]  The problem with social services is it was a nice experiment that's gone bad.
[01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:29.332]  You cannot give a bureaucracy complete and total control over families and children without accountability or the child abuse mechanism that follows behind it.
[01:06:29.772 --> 01:06:42.335]  This is not going to change until we remove the immunity that's been given to all of the people involved in the investigation and prosecution and accusations of child abuse.
[01:06:42.847 --> 01:06:44.548]  By the state and federal legislatures.
[01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.009]  It's not going to change.
[01:06:46.189 --> 01:06:50.752]  The politicians know what's going on, but the lobby's just much stronger than we.
[01:06:52.162 --> 01:06:58.067]  That's gotta be one of the most evil things in the world, because this is a holocaust of families and lives and all the kids that get killed in their custody.
[01:06:58.708 --> 01:07:04.994]  And I guess they don't care, the politicians, just the lobbyists come in and they give them the money, and it's radically expanding, isn't it?
[01:07:05.014 --> 01:07:08.317]  That's one reason we see people fighting back now, is it's just, they're everywhere.
[01:07:08.377 --> 01:07:11.519]  I mean, pretty soon... Well, the numbers are astronomical.
[01:07:11.559 --> 01:07:16.484]  You know, social services numbers, even as ill-defined as they are,
[01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:44.886]  demonstrated for the last many years that there's approximately 3 million we're not sure if it's children or accusations because like I said it's all defined but of those the Social Services Department of Health and Human Services acknowledges that they cannot meet a 51% burden on two-thirds of those which is 2 million either children accusations we don't like again don't know what the number means
[01:07:45.598 --> 01:07:54.987]  But nobody really seems to care about the hell that those families are going through and the fear that it puts in the families.
[01:07:55.007 --> 01:08:05.236]  And the power it gives the children once they understand what the power of an accusation is, because they're kids.
[01:08:05.939 --> 01:08:12.544]  But, that's why you tell your kids, you want to go live in a prison with big fat pedophiles, you go ahead and talk bad about us.
[01:08:13.084 --> 01:08:25.773]  You can do that, but I mean kids are indoctrinated in school now, you know, to tell everybody anything about anything they don't like, except don't tell your parents.
[01:08:26.818 --> 01:08:28.880]  It's only coming for reporters.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.723]  Well, first off, you go back and you let them make the mistake.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.521]  That's my home.
[01:09:20.481 --> 01:09:21.882]  I'm not afraid to be in my home.
[01:09:22.623 --> 01:09:26.425]  I cannot stop the state of Texas from doing something illegal.
[01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:28.267]  Force them to make the mistake.
[01:09:28.667 --> 01:09:30.188]  Yes, I will call CPS.
[01:09:30.568 --> 01:09:34.251]  I'll probably get the same answering machine that Janet's gotten.
[01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:35.892]  But I will call.
[01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:38.231]  No, I talked to her this morning.
[01:09:38.271 --> 01:09:39.231]  She said she'd talk to you.
[01:09:39.551 --> 01:09:43.913]  It was, yes sir, now that I made some phone calls yesterday and they looked me up.
[01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.254]  So, I mean, I think they may want to move on.
[01:09:46.755 --> 01:09:48.175]  Like, they thought this was a gazelle.
[01:09:48.215 --> 01:09:49.236]  They found out it was a tiger.
[01:09:49.256 --> 01:09:51.897]  They're going to move on to some other little poor family and corner them.
[01:09:52.277 --> 01:09:55.099]  And which is the pain, to know this is just going to keep going on.
[01:09:55.679 --> 01:10:00.361]  But I think they're finding out this is kind of a porcupine they tried to eat instead of a nice little juicy gazelle.
[01:10:00.901 --> 01:10:02.962]  Butch, does CPS want to do an interview?
[01:10:03.022 --> 01:10:03.643]  Is that what's up?
[01:10:04.183 --> 01:10:04.303]  Yep.
[01:10:06.829 --> 01:10:21.992]  You are the lawyer and I'm sure that, I don't mean to step on any toes, but if they're going to go back, wouldn't you potentially also suggest third party witnesses upon arrival and tape recorders?
[01:10:22.672 --> 01:10:23.372]  In plain view?
[01:10:23.992 --> 01:10:28.433]  Obviously tape recorders, but the answer is there's not going to be an interview without me present.
[01:10:28.873 --> 01:10:30.453]  Clients aren't talking to them.
[01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:33.954]  Correct, I'm not talking, never mind, that's not what I was talking about.
[01:10:35.134 --> 01:10:41.047]  If in fact, when they first just show up at the door, tape recorder in hand, so that they are...
[01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:43.491]  A little bit more, uh, accountable.
[01:10:43.511 --> 01:10:46.193]  Oh, by the way, I even have a little digital camera that shoots video.
[01:10:46.213 --> 01:10:47.054]  I'll give you the big camera.
[01:10:47.354 --> 01:10:51.217]  I'm gonna give you, uh, I'll loan you one of the small cameras that'll shoot for like 30 minutes.
[01:10:51.658 --> 01:10:54.480]  So you can just flip it on and it'll be on camera and record that way.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.481]  You gotta have that ready.
[01:10:55.721 --> 01:10:58.944]  And let them know, you know, I've found in my experience, be calm but focused.
[01:10:58.964 --> 01:11:02.066]  Go, look, you guys are already in enough trouble violating our rights.
[01:11:02.126 --> 01:11:02.947]  We've got a lawyer.
[01:11:03.207 --> 01:11:04.248]  We've gone to the doctor to report.
[01:11:04.288 --> 01:11:05.249]  You know, this is all made up.
[01:11:05.289 --> 01:11:06.270]  You know you told her to lie.
[01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:09.273]  Well, first off, you go to the door and the answer is, where's your search warrant?
[01:11:21.075 --> 01:11:22.175]  I'm not talking to you.
[01:11:22.215 --> 01:11:23.155]  Where's your search warrant?
[01:11:23.496 --> 01:11:24.836]  And you say let them make the mistake.
[01:11:24.876 --> 01:11:30.417]  I've seen a lot of cases where they'll go ahead and, especially the Nellies, will go ahead and force their way in.
[01:11:30.437 --> 01:11:31.717]  Kind of fall on their stomach.
[01:11:31.757 --> 01:11:33.278]  They'll kind of just worm in.
[01:11:33.898 --> 01:11:36.898]  How do you deal with that when they do that?
[01:11:38.739 --> 01:11:43.580]  The neutral place where you can argue this is a courtroom if it comes to that.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.681]  You're not going to win with one of these people at the door.
[01:11:47.821 --> 01:11:49.061]  If they want to make the mistake,
[01:11:49.953 --> 01:11:53.334]  On camera, on tape, let them make the mistake.
[01:11:53.614 --> 01:11:56.175]  But the answer is, where's your search warrant?
[01:11:57.036 --> 01:11:59.576]  You don't have the right just because you're CPS.
[01:11:59.757 --> 01:12:02.898]  And they'll keep banging on the screen saying, there may be abuse.
[01:12:02.938 --> 01:12:05.419]  Let's not, you know, let's not, you know, let me in.
[01:12:05.439 --> 01:12:06.099]  It'll be fine.
[01:12:06.139 --> 01:12:07.319]  Just let me in and it'll be all right.
[01:12:07.339 --> 01:12:09.520]  You're going to go to jail if you don't, you're going to go to jail.
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.921]  And you just, and you just say, you know, that's a terroristic threat.
[01:12:12.381 --> 01:12:13.121]  You know, that's a lie.
[01:12:13.141 --> 01:12:13.962]  I mean, what do you say then?
[01:12:15.182 --> 01:12:17.983]  The answer is you're not coming in without a search warrant.
[01:12:19.449 --> 01:12:20.890]  I don't care how long you pound.
[01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:23.853]  Make them go and commit to something.
[01:12:23.913 --> 01:12:26.695]  Let them go to the police and say there's abuse going on in there.
[01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:31.018]  What's the probable cause to believe that there's abuse happening in my home?
[01:12:31.038 --> 01:12:32.059]  Yeah.
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.381]  I think... Make them make the mistake.
[01:12:38.424 --> 01:12:41.186]  It's like when you get pulled over on the side of the road by a cop.
[01:12:41.226 --> 01:12:42.547]  You're not going to win there.
[01:12:43.068 --> 01:12:46.791]  Let them write the ticket and go to the courtroom and argue it there.
[01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:50.082]  Or hopefully cooler heads will prevail.
[01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:55.883]  But no good has ever come, in my experience, from talking to these idiots.
[01:12:59.404 --> 01:13:02.985]  Okay, so what you're saying is you're going to put them on notice they've got counsel.
[01:13:03.165 --> 01:13:04.266]  I'm going to put their phone number out.
[01:13:04.286 --> 01:13:05.126]  I think that's important.
[01:13:05.962 --> 01:13:07.544]  Absolutely.
[01:13:07.564 --> 01:13:16.472]  And from a lot of the experts I've talked to over the years, and I like your aggressive stance, my thing is if you've got the time and money, and Joe's on vacation this week, just split.
[01:13:17.433 --> 01:13:25.440]  That way, go to the beach or something, or go to San Antonio, go to the zoo, and then they'll usually move on to some other child they want to kidnap so they can do their horrible stuff.
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:28.463]  Well, for the fact that school is not over, I assume school's not over.
[01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:30.872]  Up in Hayes County, it's not over down here.
[01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:33.975]  Yeah, so you think in the next week they'd try to trump up something?
[01:13:34.015 --> 01:13:35.336]  She's only missed three days of school.
[01:13:35.876 --> 01:13:46.163]  Well, what happens when they put her back in school and the cops come in and surround her and they show her the letter and they just snatch it out of her hand and say, you're going to jail unless you say your mommy hurt you, which is what they did.
[01:13:47.664 --> 01:13:49.806]  And, you know, people have trouble believing this.
[01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:52.348]  This is what we've seen on countless interrogation videos.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:54.300]  I have no doubt.
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:56.501]  I'm aware of similar instances.
[01:13:57.021 --> 01:14:01.602]  That's why I said, you make a laminated card the size of a business card and have your child carry it.
[01:14:01.942 --> 01:14:04.422]  I don't want to say anything without my parent or lawyer being present.
[01:14:04.883 --> 01:14:09.364]  What is this business about them telling her, you can't have your daughter at your house, take her to your mother's?
[01:14:09.464 --> 01:14:11.584]  Is that them just trying to take control of the situation?
[01:14:11.924 --> 01:14:12.464]  Absolutely.
[01:14:14.385 --> 01:14:15.025]  Absolutely.
[01:14:16.725 --> 01:14:18.226]  They don't have a right to do that.
[01:14:18.446 --> 01:14:20.346]  They have the right to go to court and file a pleading.
[01:14:20.942 --> 01:14:24.384]  And say there's an emergency and let somebody swear what the emergency is?
[01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:32.449]  Had one within the last couple of months in Galveston where the emergency was the parents refused to talk to CPS.
[01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:37.032]  Well, Judge promptly said, no, that's not an emergency.
[01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:40.294]  And no, that's not grounds to remove the child.
[01:14:42.416 --> 01:14:47.459]  The most destructive ones are when they tell one of the parents they have to divorce the other.
[01:14:49.011 --> 01:14:55.283]  That is one that's most distressing because most people are in no emotional state to deal with.
[01:14:55.694 --> 01:14:55.914]  Thank you.
[01:14:55.934 --> 01:14:56.094]  I am.
[01:15:21.385 --> 01:15:21.865]  Well, great.
[01:15:22.045 --> 01:15:23.886]  Give us your insight on that, because I don't think people understand.
[01:15:24.566 --> 01:15:26.927]  These are the groups that would come and sterilize you forcibly.
[01:15:27.247 --> 01:15:29.068]  That's how they're outside the Constitution.
[01:15:29.348 --> 01:15:34.350]  This is a criminal, vestigial thing left over from the Hitlerian era that has just grown.
[01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:36.310]  That's right.
[01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:38.911]  It's like the syphilis experiments.
[01:15:38.931 --> 01:15:44.113]  You know, gee, we're going to pick a class of people that we can use as guinea pigs.
[01:15:45.653 --> 01:15:50.275]  And it's been many, many years since I read the stuff on the
[01:15:50.751 --> 01:16:02.298]  The eugenics and so forth, but the classic abuse to me are the black men who had syphilis and gonorrhea and who were not treated.
[01:16:02.318 --> 01:16:04.079]  We're going to see how the diseases progress.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.461]  And they told them they were getting treatment and they let them spread it.
[01:16:07.021 --> 01:16:07.281]  Yeah.
[01:16:08.742 --> 01:16:13.265]  But, you know, now we do this in the context of specialized family courts.
[01:16:13.305 --> 01:16:19.149]  We have 40 courts because this is where, you know, we now have abuse courts being set up.
[01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:24.804]  Where the Constitution doesn't apply, because there was no such thing as family court when the Constitution was written.
[01:16:24.824 --> 01:16:31.627]  Meanwhile, everywhere, teachers now beat students, choke them, hit them, police taser five-year-olds, and that's all okay.
[01:16:31.647 --> 01:16:34.589]  They all have immunity, trying to keep control of society.
[01:16:34.869 --> 01:16:43.953]  But then, if a parent's kid is running out in the street and you spat him, boom, your kid's gone, so that big fat pedophiles can, you know, have their way with him.
[01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.055]  Well, it's even more than a parent
[01:16:49.349 --> 01:16:49.729]  Thank you.
[01:17:06.718 --> 01:17:12.781]  They never question whether or not the child is actually saying something that actually happened to them.
[01:17:12.801 --> 01:17:14.622]  Because they want to break up the family.
[01:17:15.042 --> 01:17:17.403]  Or something that they're putting into the kid themselves.
[01:17:17.804 --> 01:17:18.164]  Exactly.
[01:17:18.204 --> 01:17:18.864]  I forgot that.
[01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:20.585]  You're not allowed to yell at them now.
[01:17:21.045 --> 01:17:21.806]  That's not a law.
[01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:25.308]  They just say we're going to take them.
[01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:32.832]  All of the states have something the equivalent of the Child Endangerment Statute, which I call the Maybe, Might Have, Possibly, Could Have.
[01:17:33.464 --> 01:17:39.265]  You know, unwarranted disciplinary measures, if continued over an extended period of time, might cause damage.
[01:17:39.645 --> 01:17:40.705]  Something along that line.
[01:17:40.725 --> 01:17:41.786]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:17:42.086 --> 01:17:48.967]  Okay, um, Kim Hart, um, Butch Perot, I want to keep in contact with both of you.
[01:17:49.007 --> 01:17:51.588]  I'm going to have, I'm going to have you probably back up both tomorrow.
[01:17:51.608 --> 01:17:55.008]  We can't in part two of this, but I'm going to get Janet and Joe to call you right now.
[01:17:55.108 --> 01:17:56.088]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[01:17:56.108 --> 01:17:58.869]  When we come back, I'm going to give out the websites for falseallegation.org.
[01:18:01.064 --> 01:18:05.967]  Since 1991, The Seven Store has been helping you prepare in the event of an emergency.

[01:18:52.352 --> 01:18:52.552]  That's 888-654-3447.
[01:19:00.762 --> 01:19:02.103]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:02.283 --> 01:19:07.267]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.

[01:19:45.282 --> 01:19:47.383]  Let the bailout group bail you out of debt.
[01:19:47.643 --> 01:19:51.930]  Reduce your payments by up to 60% and save you thousands of dollars today.
[01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:53.111]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554.
[01:19:53.131 --> 01:19:53.172]  800-324-6554.
[01:19:53.192 --> 01:19:53.672]  The Bailout Group.
[01:20:02.074 --> 01:20:02.955]  Spring is here.
[01:20:03.215 --> 01:20:03.995]  Growing season.
[01:20:04.175 --> 01:20:06.156]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:20:06.356 --> 01:20:07.777]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:20:08.077 --> 01:20:08.738]  Think about it.
[01:20:09.058 --> 01:20:12.900]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:16.622]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:20:16.842 --> 01:20:19.403]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:20:19.664 --> 01:20:31.530]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:32.210]  I think so.
[01:21:11.756 --> 01:21:18.138]  Alright, folks, I've got a bunch of financial news and your phone calls and a ton of news I haven't gotten to coming up in the next hour.
[01:21:18.158 --> 01:21:20.738]  We're going to do a brief thing about CPS, trying to steal people's kids.
[01:21:21.559 --> 01:21:25.920]  When the kids already die and it doesn't want any more chemo and they say, no, we're taking it and giving them chemo until they kill them.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:27.900]  Just amazing.
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:30.641]  And this goes with them trying to force inoculations on everybody.
[01:21:30.921 --> 01:21:35.002]  But I wanted to bring up Rachel Wimbush with Stuckel & Ferguson Law Firm.
[01:21:35.542 --> 01:21:37.983]  Also doing research, came highly recommended.
[01:21:38.003 --> 01:21:43.304]  It's paulstuckel.com dealing with this type of activity.
[01:21:43.544 --> 01:21:46.645]  So I wanted to bring her up for a few minutes with what her advice is.
[01:21:46.665 --> 01:21:47.705]  We're getting different perspectives.
[01:21:48.406 --> 01:21:51.847]  Have you been filled in, Rachel, on this story?
[01:21:51.887 --> 01:21:53.107]  I'm sure you've heard it a million times.
[01:21:54.662 --> 01:22:13.614]  Yes, and we deal with CPS and false allegations, parents being falsely accused of sexual abuse or physical abuse or neglect of their children, and we hear these sad stories every day, and it's a war against our families.
[01:22:15.438 --> 01:22:17.380]  But you've got to feel good because you're doing good work.
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:20.203]  I don't know how these, well I guess they have the highest turnover of any industry.
[01:22:20.223 --> 01:22:21.805]  50 plus percent I've read.
[01:22:22.165 --> 01:22:23.426]  I mean, how do these people do this?
[01:22:23.506 --> 01:22:24.467]  Break people's rights?
[01:22:24.627 --> 01:22:25.068]  Lie?
[01:22:25.508 --> 01:22:29.512]  And then they're five times more likely to abuse children in CPS than anywhere else?
[01:22:29.532 --> 01:22:30.874]  According to the Justice Department?
[01:22:30.894 --> 01:22:32.435]  Well, what would you advise them to do?
[01:22:32.475 --> 01:22:38.402]  Because they're not saying what they're, you know, they strip searched their daughter, has a little bruise on her leg they saw with shorts.
[01:22:39.202 --> 01:22:41.063]  Uh, they strip-searched and tried to find more.
[01:22:41.103 --> 01:22:41.864]  There was nothing more.
[01:22:41.884 --> 01:22:47.027]  It was a little bruise, the size of a, maybe in between a quarter and a nickel, clearly from a table.
[01:22:47.047 --> 01:22:47.868]  You know, we've all had them.
[01:22:48.508 --> 01:22:51.030]  She told them that, and they said over and over again, no, your mommy did this.
[01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:52.791]  You're going to be in trouble if you don't say.
[01:22:53.071 --> 01:22:54.352]  She said, okay, my mommy did it.
[01:22:54.592 --> 01:23:02.718]  But she's on record saying, then they took photos, laptop, didn't tell her, and let her go to gymnastics at the end of school, called her and said, come to your house.
[01:23:02.758 --> 01:23:07.781]  In my experience, they wanted to come in the house and dig up some dirt or say it was neglect or there was dishes or something.
[01:23:08.222 --> 01:23:08.422]  I mean,
[01:23:08.902 --> 01:23:10.823]  So, what would you do about this?
[01:23:10.843 --> 01:23:12.304]  I mean, they won't say what they want.
[01:23:12.785 --> 01:23:14.866]  She drove by her place where she was going to meet him.
[01:23:15.086 --> 01:23:16.907]  There was the cop car with the CPS.
[01:23:17.168 --> 01:23:19.469]  What does this sound like?
[01:23:20.049 --> 01:23:26.914]  It sounds like they already have it in their head, which all of them do, the law enforcement and CPS.
[01:23:27.855 --> 01:23:36.881]  They always believe the child, and if the child doesn't tell them what they want to hear, then they will threaten and intimidate the child.
[01:23:37.521 --> 01:23:48.728]  They see it as the children are victims of abuse and they're set out to prove it regardless of any type of evidence or indicia to the contrary.
[01:23:48.748 --> 01:23:51.530]  Now let's be clear though, most police aren't involved.
[01:23:51.550 --> 01:24:00.215]  Don't they, from what I've seen, you're the expert, have little special pet police that are part of the psychosis, kind of like the Nazis, that will go out and violate people?
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:18.955]  They do, and actually a lot of the advocacy centers where the CPS workers and the forensic interviewers are housed, there are detectives specially assigned to these child abuse cases, and so they work hand-in-hand with each other.
[01:24:19.395 --> 01:24:22.778]  So they choose to be there because they like children so much.
[01:24:24.519 --> 01:24:27.302]  Okay, so where should they go from here in your opinion?
[01:24:28.226 --> 01:24:43.890]  Well, with the instance that you're talking about right now, it sounds to me like the family needs to have very strong and vigorous defense against CPS because the child needs to be protected against the foster system.
[01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:52.212]  There's horrendous things that happen to these children when they're removed from a family and placed into oftentimes dangerous environments.
[01:24:52.936 --> 01:24:53.337]  I think so.
[01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:13.858]  And of course the system has an incentive to defend these horrible warrants where they keep children, where they routinely die.
[01:25:14.179 --> 01:25:15.159]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[01:25:15.199 --> 01:25:15.499]  Stay there.
[01:25:15.519 --> 01:25:17.760]  I want to do five more minutes with you to get more advice.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.221]  I mean, CPS wants to meet.
[01:25:19.261 --> 01:25:20.181]  They want to come to the house.
[01:25:20.541 --> 01:25:24.202]  Should they go back and stay at their house, say no, bring a warrant or bring a protective order?
[01:25:24.583 --> 01:25:25.203]  Should they wait?
[01:25:26.043 --> 01:25:27.724]  I mean, what should they do?
[01:25:27.764 --> 01:25:32.086]  Your perspective on this as an expert who's been involved in hundreds of these cases.
[01:25:32.146 --> 01:25:37.848]  Attorney at law, Rachel Wimbush, with us as they try to kidnap young Haley out of our office.
[01:25:37.868 --> 01:25:38.588]  We'll be right back.

[01:25:50.976 --> 01:25:59.344]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:25:59.624 --> 01:26:04.028]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[01:26:04.469 --> 01:26:09.654]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[01:26:53.504 --> 01:26:55.425]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:55.885 --> 01:26:58.667]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:10.456 --> 01:27:13.820]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to give you the phone numbers of these wicked creatures.
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:15.902]  There are child kidnappers everywhere.
[01:27:16.383 --> 01:27:17.324]  Claim they have immunity.
[01:27:17.484 --> 01:27:17.924]  Operating.
[01:27:18.285 --> 01:27:18.645]  Hitler!
[01:27:18.665 --> 01:27:24.171]  And I always hate to go back to Hitler, but Hitler operated under the same eugenics program that set up the family courts.
[01:27:25.072 --> 01:27:25.953]  He got it from the U.S.
[01:27:25.993 --> 01:27:26.373]  and England.
[01:27:26.914 --> 01:27:34.200]  And the first people they killed, the first people they put in death camps, the first people that they shut down, were families.
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:36.642]  They'd say, oh, you're not fit to have your child.
[01:27:36.743 --> 01:27:38.104]  Oh, we're going to euthanize your child.
[01:27:38.124 --> 01:27:41.166]  You know, you'd get a letter back, oh, your child died in CPS custody.
[01:27:41.787 --> 01:27:42.628]  And then they put
[01:27:43.268 --> 01:27:44.991]  More than two-thirds of the kids on psychotropics.
[01:27:45.011 --> 01:27:46.653]  A lot of them die from the drugs they put them on.
[01:27:46.994 --> 01:27:49.657]  And then they go before the state in Texas and say they have bad gene pools.
[01:27:49.677 --> 01:27:51.420]  We have that on video in Endgame.
[01:27:51.981 --> 01:27:54.504]  Going back to Rachel Wimbush.
[01:27:54.925 --> 01:27:57.969]  Rachel, what do you think they should do then, you know, hearing this?
[01:27:58.490 --> 01:28:04.332]  I mean, do they go, and I know you're not taking the case, you're just, what you would do, you know, if you had this case, would you go back home?
[01:28:04.632 --> 01:28:05.173]  Would you wait?
[01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.053]  Would you stay away?
[01:28:06.073 --> 01:28:10.234]  You know, would you have a lawyer contact the CPS and say, what is this about?
[01:28:10.575 --> 01:28:11.695]  You know, how far have you gone?
[01:28:11.735 --> 01:28:12.395]  They wouldn't talk to me.
[01:28:12.415 --> 01:28:13.716]  They said, we'll talk to her or her lawyer.
[01:28:13.936 --> 01:28:15.676]  But when she then talks to them, they won't talk to her.
[01:28:15.696 --> 01:28:17.757]  They just say, come meet us, come meet us.
[01:28:19.118 --> 01:28:21.098]  They don't need to do anything right now.
[01:28:21.679 --> 01:28:27.581]  They've already experienced how CPS works and where CPS is going with this.
[01:28:28.582 --> 01:28:38.634]  And if they don't have a basis to remove the children, and there's not an emergency right now, CPS can't do anything.
[01:28:38.694 --> 01:28:40.676]  And so they do not need to cooperate.
[01:28:40.756 --> 01:28:47.483]  They need to have an independent defense attorney represent them and have
[01:28:48.284 --> 01:28:58.307]  Independent evaluations of everything that's going on and not cooperate with CPS because CPS already has it in their mind what they're doing and what they're going after.
[01:28:58.327 --> 01:29:06.830]  And if they show up at their house, if they don't have a warrant, they don't have to let them in, they don't have to talk with them.
[01:29:07.771 --> 01:29:20.477]  And it's advisable that they don't, because CPS and the Advocacy Center, everybody that works in this whole industry... Are they lying incessantly?
[01:29:21.318 --> 01:29:28.201]  Yes, and they're all on each other's food chain, and their careers are based on... What about school?
[01:29:28.621 --> 01:29:29.982]  What if they grab her at school?
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:43.249]  Unfortunately, they come in and speak with children all the time at school without notifying the parents as they're required to do within a certain period of time after speaking with the children.
[01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:51.075]  But the girl should just not say anything and say, I want you to call my parents.
[01:29:51.175 --> 01:29:53.637]  I want you to speak with my attorney.
[01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.265]  Absolutely.
[01:29:58.565 --> 01:30:13.069]  Because right now, the way that CPS is headed, and we see this all the time in all of our other cases as well, they've already got it in their head where they're going and just trying to cooperate with them is only going to make things worse.
[01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:17.750]  And until the family stands up and fights,
[01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:20.771]  Well, you're up in the Dallas-Fort Worth area?
[01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:55.252]  Yes, we at Stuckel and Ferguson, we represent families all across the state of Texas in CPS cases as well as criminal cases that arise out of false allegations of child abuse or false allegations of child sexual abuse.
[01:30:55.372 --> 01:30:58.896]  Have you heard of attorney Butch Brott out of Houston?
[01:30:59.878 --> 01:31:00.840]  No, I have not.
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:02.483]  Yeah, he got recommended.
[01:31:02.503 --> 01:31:04.767]  Go ahead.
[01:31:04.807 --> 01:31:07.593]  I'm sure Paul Stuckel has heard of him before.
[01:31:07.673 --> 01:31:09.576]  Paul is the founding partner here.
[01:31:10.353 --> 01:31:15.617]  No, I'm just trying to figure out who we should get in Austin, or what we should do for them, or who should talk to these creatures.
[01:31:15.677 --> 01:31:24.263]  I mean, would it be good to have a lawyer call the child grabber and try to ascertain where they're at?
[01:31:24.423 --> 01:31:32.469]  Or send a letter, an overnight delivery to the school saying, you will not talk to her without us being here.
[01:31:32.569 --> 01:31:34.111]  Here's the law firm.
[01:31:36.512 --> 01:31:38.354]  Or just sit there and wait for them to make a move.
[01:31:39.234 --> 01:31:44.057]  No, I mean, with these people, you can't sit around and wait for them to make a move.
[01:31:44.097 --> 01:31:48.859]  You have to stand up and say, this is who I am.
[01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.582]  We can meet to talk about it, but my client is not talking to you.
[01:31:53.822 --> 01:31:54.442]  They're done.
[01:31:54.662 --> 01:31:56.883]  And you're done harassing their children.
[01:31:57.003 --> 01:31:59.024]  OK, do five more minutes with us, because I've got a few more questions.

[01:33:01.545 --> 01:33:06.847]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:33:07.367 --> 01:33:14.330]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:33:14.927 --> 01:33:21.149]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:23.349]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:33:23.489 --> 01:33:25.910]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:36.853]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:33:37.575 --> 01:33:38.856]  It's not about left or right.
[01:33:39.236 --> 01:33:40.637]  It's about a one world government.
[01:33:41.077 --> 01:33:47.401]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:33:56.267 --> 01:33:57.408]  The Obama Deception.
[01:33:57.828 --> 01:33:59.029]  The people strike back.
[01:34:01.161 --> 01:34:04.424]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:34:04.584 --> 01:34:08.668]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:34:08.848 --> 01:34:20.278]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:34:20.518 --> 01:34:26.323]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:34:26.563 --> 01:34:27.203]  We're good to go.
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:50.061]  We're good to go.
[01:35:02.216 --> 01:35:08.237]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:35:08.837 --> 01:35:11.878]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:12.318 --> 01:35:14.318]  You know, there's all this world news going on around us.
[01:35:14.378 --> 01:35:15.998]  I'm going to cover that coming up in a few minutes.
[01:35:16.098 --> 01:35:21.319]  But fundamentally, the state all over the Western world is publicly waging war against the family.
[01:35:22.139 --> 01:35:29.061]  They'll pay poor black mothers money not just to not have men in the house and break the family down from 10% in legitimacy to over 90% now.
[01:35:29.501 --> 01:35:30.941]  They see the family as a disease.
[01:35:32.134 --> 01:35:33.115]  And they want to break it down.
[01:35:33.135 --> 01:35:34.055]  They've done a pretty good job.
[01:35:34.075 --> 01:35:35.236]  The families are all screwed up.
[01:35:35.276 --> 01:35:38.477]  Breaking down society, breaking down the state will be the only buoy.
[01:35:39.037 --> 01:35:41.178]  Then we can come to them and they can euthanize us.
[01:35:41.198 --> 01:35:42.499]  They can carry out their eugenics.
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:45.300]  Rachel Wimbish,
[01:35:47.878 --> 01:35:54.500]  You know, I finally talked to my personal lawyer, Eric Tabb, and one of his partners is a family court lawyer.
[01:35:55.061 --> 01:35:56.001]  And we're talking to him now.
[01:35:56.061 --> 01:35:57.822]  We've talked to Brott.
[01:35:58.162 --> 01:35:59.022]  We're talking to you.
[01:35:59.042 --> 01:36:00.943]  I know this stuff moves so quick.
[01:36:00.963 --> 01:36:01.983]  I guess that's the problem.
[01:36:02.443 --> 01:36:05.324]  Were they planning to meet her at the house with the police?
[01:36:05.404 --> 01:36:06.545]  And we confirmed that was going on.
[01:36:07.145 --> 01:36:07.245]  She's
[01:36:21.537 --> 01:36:27.982]  Yeah, because anything that she says to them, they're just going to turn around and twist it and use it against her.
[01:36:28.622 --> 01:36:32.825]  We've seen numerous times where CPS workers have lied on the stand.
[01:36:33.305 --> 01:36:44.993]  They have perjured themselves and the state, since they're a part of the state and a part of this whole child favor industry, does not prosecute their own people when they lie and fabricate facts.
[01:36:45.613 --> 01:36:54.298]  And if they go to her house, unless they have a warrant to enter into her home, she does not have to let them in.
[01:36:54.398 --> 01:37:03.904]  And in fact, cooperating and letting them in to take pictures, to take pictures of her children, to look at the house to see if there's a stain on the carpet.
[01:37:04.664 --> 01:37:11.410]  Um, all of that will be used against her to say that, um, the home was in substandard living conditions.
[01:37:11.831 --> 01:37:13.933]  Um, you know, the children are being neglected.
[01:37:14.013 --> 01:37:16.695]  They'll even look in the refrigerator, the pantry.
[01:37:17.416 --> 01:37:29.647]  Um, cooperating with these people and meeting with these people without a vigorous defense attorney with the client to represent her and to do the talking for her is, is just
[01:37:30.086 --> 01:37:30.186]  No.
[01:37:30.246 --> 01:37:30.326]  No.
[01:37:30.346 --> 01:37:30.386]  No.
[01:37:49.236 --> 01:37:51.557]  They are, and their theory is divide and conquer.
[01:37:51.637 --> 01:37:52.898]  We see it all the time.
[01:37:53.038 --> 01:38:00.522]  They believe the children, and in the cases of sexual abuse... They believe the children, they make the children do it.
[01:38:01.222 --> 01:38:01.683]  Of course!
[01:38:01.803 --> 01:38:03.744]  They say, you will say this or you're in trouble.
[01:38:04.164 --> 01:38:06.387]  I mean, these are evil people!
[01:38:07.128 --> 01:38:19.123]  Exactly, and they don't understand that children can actually be, especially in custody battles, we see it a lot, children are manipulated into making false allegations against
[01:38:19.543 --> 01:38:19.984]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:38:40.986 --> 01:38:44.728]  At school, they've been watching the good touch and bad touch videos.
[01:38:44.848 --> 01:38:46.869]  Then they go after the parent.
[01:38:46.969 --> 01:38:47.970]  We see it all the time.
[01:38:48.010 --> 01:38:51.892]  They actually will divide families and pit them against each other.
[01:38:51.932 --> 01:38:53.433]  Well, that's like sexual education.
[01:38:53.493 --> 01:38:57.015]  It turns out makes them have more sex or makes them tattle, make up stuff.
[01:38:57.575 --> 01:39:03.298]  It's proven they have death education about don't commit suicide by putting this around your neck and then the kids commit suicide.
[01:39:03.638 --> 01:39:04.899]  You know, they know what they're doing.
[01:39:05.479 --> 01:39:09.962]  They sit there and they teach them how to do all of this and the public schools are federalized.
[01:39:10.302 --> 01:39:13.244]  They are a complete re-education camps is what I call them.
[01:39:13.885 --> 01:39:15.606]  And well, we'll be in contact.
[01:39:15.646 --> 01:39:19.729]  Rachel Wimbish, I'm very impressed by your information and what you're saying.
[01:39:20.309 --> 01:39:30.796]  And I guess we've just got to, you know, try to figure all this out and and figure out, I mean, I mean, do they put their poor little daughter, what, is she out of school next Wednesday?
[01:39:32.597 --> 01:39:33.318]  Yeah, June 2nd.
[01:39:33.758 --> 01:39:34.879]  What is June 2nd, next Wednesday?
[01:39:35.922 --> 01:39:36.642]  Tuesday I believe.
[01:39:57.293 --> 01:40:10.542]  You know, and he said the same thing that they're saying, that they made a big deal for the strip search and a big boo-boo, a big no-no with not notifying you on Monday and then sending cops in Tuesday.
[01:40:11.322 --> 01:40:12.443]  I haven't had a chance to talk to him.
[01:40:12.643 --> 01:40:13.524]  Mike in the office was.
[01:40:14.224 --> 01:40:15.505]  Rachel, any comments on that?
[01:40:16.735 --> 01:40:28.982]  Well, anytime the CPS comes out and speaks with the children or takes pictures at the schools, they do have to notify the parents afterwards at the minimum.
[01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:46.533]  But the problem with the schools these days is that they're mandatory reporters, and so it's often a pass-the-buck type deal where if they see a bruise, instead of asking the child what happened or even calling the parents and talking to the parents and saying, hey, you know, I'm concerned, is everything
[01:40:46.633 --> 01:40:46.853]  Okay.
[01:41:08.055 --> 01:41:11.136]  Indicates that they're not satisfied with your answer.
[01:41:11.216 --> 01:41:15.098]  Children eventually will change the answer to get this person to go away.
[01:41:15.198 --> 01:41:20.880]  Well, no, that's exactly... I mean, let's say I'm talking to an eight-year-old girl and I say, did you see a green alligator back there in the swimming pool?
[01:41:21.101 --> 01:41:21.341]  No.
[01:41:23.141 --> 01:41:24.242]  Did you see a green alligator?
[01:41:24.302 --> 01:41:24.502]  No.
[01:41:24.742 --> 01:41:26.623]  You're in trouble if you don't tell me.
[01:41:26.643 --> 01:41:32.225]  They actually said to Haley, you're in trouble if you don't tell me the truth.
[01:41:32.405 --> 01:41:34.106]  She said, okay, I guess she did.
[01:41:34.126 --> 01:41:36.127]  I mean, these people are sick.
[01:41:38.009 --> 01:41:46.879]  And when they interview children, they are supposed to be recording the conversation if they're talking with children alone, without the parents there.
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:55.809]  And if they threatened her like this, then that worker needs to be held personally liable for intimidating this child.
[01:41:57.051 --> 01:42:02.014]  You know, she's saying that lady's name was Heather, and then we don't know this other one was actually there on site.
[01:42:02.054 --> 01:42:03.375]  Okay, well, we'll talk to you soon.
[01:42:03.875 --> 01:42:06.136]  The website is paulstuckel.com.
[01:42:06.156 --> 01:42:09.698]  It's a law firm, paulstuckel, S-T-U-C-K-L-E dot com.
[01:42:10.519 --> 01:42:15.342]  Rachel Wimbush, attorney at Stuckel & Ferguson, a law firm specializing in false allegations of child abuse.
[01:42:15.642 --> 01:42:17.243]  Thank you for your information.
[01:42:17.843 --> 01:42:22.626]  Thank you so much, and thank you for bringing awareness to this problem in our society.
[01:42:22.666 --> 01:42:24.527]  I mean, it really is a war on our families.
[01:42:24.915 --> 01:42:26.015]  You bet it is, God bless you.
[01:42:26.616 --> 01:42:34.198]  Folks, there's nothing more fundamental than the state running around with eugenics courts set up 90 years ago, just doing whatever they want.
[01:42:34.218 --> 01:42:36.319]  I mean, my film, Endgame, covers it, folks.
[01:42:36.359 --> 01:42:37.219]  Everybody's got to see it.
[01:42:37.819 --> 01:42:40.980]  Where the CPS would come and kill your baby.
[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:47.022]  The CPS was set up where they would come and if your baby was deformed or they said it was ill, they would smother it.
[01:42:48.162 --> 01:42:51.023]  And we have the newsreels of them killing children in the film.
[01:42:51.703 --> 01:42:53.944]  You will see them, or refuse care to a baby.
[01:42:55.461 --> 01:43:00.944]  See, folks, once you know history, those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it, are doomed to repeat it.
[01:43:01.304 --> 01:43:04.605]  Once you know it, you know what you're seeing, and you heard the lawyer earlier knew about this.
[01:43:05.106 --> 01:43:06.146]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:43:06.186 --> 01:43:07.427]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to give you
[01:43:08.902 --> 01:43:09.562]  The phone numbers.
[01:43:10.262 --> 01:43:11.123]  You guys want him to call.
[01:43:11.143 --> 01:43:15.684]  Do you want a request of the audience, Janet and Joe, that people call?
[01:43:16.424 --> 01:43:16.644]  Yes.
[01:43:17.124 --> 01:43:17.724]  Oh yes, we do.
[01:43:18.384 --> 01:43:19.685]  Okay, I'm going to ask the audience.
[01:43:19.705 --> 01:43:26.606]  You got our YouTube channel, that and the federal filing I did, got it turned back on, and that's millions of people will now see the truth because of you.
[01:43:26.666 --> 01:43:27.566]  I'm going to ask all of you.
[01:43:27.586 --> 01:43:28.707]  I know I've spent all day on this.
[01:43:28.727 --> 01:43:32.468]  There's a lot of other important things, but this is fundamental, and I couldn't eat yesterday.
[01:43:32.508 --> 01:43:33.068]  I couldn't sleep.
[01:43:33.408 --> 01:43:33.868]  Kind of good, though.
[01:43:33.888 --> 01:43:34.748]  I got on the scales this morning.
[01:43:34.768 --> 01:43:35.408]  I've been on a diet.
[01:43:35.708 --> 01:43:36.749]  I lost three pounds yesterday.
[01:43:36.789 --> 01:43:37.429]  I was so upset.
[01:43:41.242 --> 01:43:44.903]  Because it's so fundamental and we've been conditioned just to accept this like it's normal.
[01:43:44.943 --> 01:43:49.925]  And seeing you crying yesterday, seeing that horror in your face, it totally registered with me.
[01:43:50.925 --> 01:43:56.927]  And to know we've got all this hell coming up, whatever it's going to be with these monsters, we need to hit them and hit them hard with the truth.
[01:43:57.007 --> 01:44:06.651]  Politely, but say, with the case of little Haley, write this down folks, Haley at the Buda Elementary School.
[01:44:07.811 --> 01:44:08.572]  I want you to call the
[01:44:10.031 --> 01:44:15.033]  Buda AISD, the ISD, then fiscal district, not independent, federal brainwashing camp.
[01:44:15.574 --> 01:44:17.074]  I want you to call the city.
[01:44:17.194 --> 01:44:18.115]  I want you to call the county.
[01:44:18.135 --> 01:44:19.295]  I want you to call the police station.
[01:44:20.236 --> 01:44:23.117]  Now, here is the Hays County Sheriff's Office.
[01:44:23.797 --> 01:44:26.218]  Tell them that the CPS criminals are running wild.
[01:44:26.299 --> 01:44:33.522]  It's the Sheriff's job to stop them strip-searching, abusing, and like Soviet commanders, making her lie about her parents.
[01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:36.543]  Hays County Sheriff's Office.
[01:44:36.583 --> 01:44:44.087]  You need to call, file complaints about what's going on in that re-education center known as the Buda Bulldog Elementary Center.
[01:44:44.107 --> 01:44:44.147]  512-393-7800.
[01:44:44.167 --> 01:44:44.407]  512-393-7800.
[01:44:44.627 --> 01:44:44.887]  Call them.
[01:44:44.967 --> 01:44:47.428]  Did you guys get me the Buda Police Department?
[01:45:00.469 --> 01:45:00.849]  Where is it?
[01:45:01.009 --> 01:45:01.629]  It's on screen.
[01:45:02.250 --> 01:45:03.670]  Buda Elementary School.
[01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:05.311]  This is the most important one.
[01:45:05.331 --> 01:45:05.831]  Let them know.
[01:45:06.131 --> 01:45:07.491]  Don't harass Haley anymore.
[01:45:07.891 --> 01:45:08.712]  Don't strip search her.
[01:45:08.752 --> 01:45:09.972]  Don't tell her to lie anymore.
[01:45:09.992 --> 01:45:11.433]  Or a little bruise on her leg.
[01:45:11.453 --> 01:45:12.313]  You people are nuts.
[01:45:13.053 --> 01:45:17.275]  They go from the schools giving you paddlings just ten years ago to... Man, this country's gone.
[01:45:19.138 --> 01:45:19.278]  512-268-8449.
[01:45:19.298 --> 01:45:19.338]  512-268-8449.
[01:45:19.378 --> 01:45:20.539]  Fax them at 512-295-2946.
[01:45:20.579 --> 01:45:21.640]  Call them, folks.
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:21.700]  512-268-8449.
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:22.320]  Call them now.
[01:45:22.341 --> 01:45:22.941]  Or fax them.
[01:45:22.961 --> 01:45:22.981]  295-2946.
[01:45:23.041 --> 01:45:27.625]  And you tell them it's going to be on TV here locally in Austin as well.
[01:45:48.348 --> 01:45:49.933]  Again, Buda Elementary School.
[01:45:50.134 --> 01:45:54.487]  Grades... Now that's K-2.
[01:45:54.547 --> 01:45:54.988]  What's K-2?
[01:45:55.009 --> 01:45:55.229]  1 through 2?
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:58.060]  Kindergarten through second grade.
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:45:58.761]  What grade is she in?
[01:45:58.781 --> 01:45:59.001]  Third?
[01:45:59.361 --> 01:45:59.981]  She's in second.
[01:46:00.101 --> 01:46:00.761]  Okay, that's perfect.
[01:46:00.861 --> 01:46:03.782]  There's an uphill and downhill campus.
[01:46:04.182 --> 01:46:04.862]  Uphill and downhill.
[01:46:04.882 --> 01:46:05.703]  This is the right one.
[01:46:05.723 --> 01:46:06.703]  512-268-8449.
[01:46:08.664 --> 01:46:10.004]  Fax 512-295-2946.
[01:46:10.904 --> 01:46:15.566]  Hit them with news articles about the CPS abusing people.
[01:46:15.886 --> 01:46:17.226]  Hit them with our information.
[01:46:17.286 --> 01:46:17.706]  Let them know.
[01:46:17.726 --> 01:46:19.187]  Let them know we're fully aware of their activities.
[01:46:21.325 --> 01:46:23.667]  Look at this, Buda Elementary School, where children come first.
[01:46:23.707 --> 01:46:23.867]  Yeah.
[01:46:23.887 --> 01:46:26.048]  Putting them in FEMA camps comes first.
[01:46:26.509 --> 01:46:27.169]  Look at this article.
[01:46:27.409 --> 01:46:30.872]  Town Hall, hire citizens, snoopers as young as 7 to spy on neighbors.
[01:46:31.252 --> 01:46:32.353]  This is the type of news we've got.
[01:46:32.373 --> 01:46:37.216]  When I come back, final segment on this, I'm going to give you... I had the right number here.
[01:46:38.357 --> 01:46:43.460]  I want to give people the Buda phone number to their police station.
[01:46:44.301 --> 01:46:48.444]  And I've also got... I've got the city council here, 512.
[01:46:50.333 --> 01:46:59.735]  3-1-2-0-0-8-4, 5-1-2-3-1-2-0-0-8-4, and I'll give you the mayor, Bobby Lane, who runs this operation.
[01:47:01.115 --> 01:47:01.435]  Hello.
[01:47:01.795 --> 01:47:09.797]  eFoodsDirect wants everyone to have food that tastes better than home cooking, but we have found some more people that we don't want to have our food.
[01:47:10.177 --> 01:47:16.118]  If you think pornography is protected free speech, but speaking to God in public prayer should be prohibited.
[01:47:20.799 --> 01:47:27.322]  Millions of jobs should be put out of business, but modern day money changers who create nothing should be bailed out?
[01:47:27.602 --> 01:47:29.403]  Don't visit efoodsdirect.com.
[01:47:29.683 --> 01:47:37.767]  If you think that schools should give kids condoms and teach abortion, but should ban Bibles on campus, don't visit efoodsdirect.com.
[01:47:38.207 --> 01:47:44.610]  If you think that the White House garden should be front page news, while laws are passed making it illegal for you to have a
[01:47:48.183 --> 01:47:51.264]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:48:08.622 --> 01:48:13.964]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:48:14.504 --> 01:48:20.686]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:48:21.026 --> 01:48:22.807]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:48:22.967 --> 01:48:25.347]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:48:25.427 --> 01:48:36.311]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:48:38.596 --> 01:48:39.857]  It's not about left or right.
[01:48:40.277 --> 01:48:41.657]  It's about a one world government.
[01:48:42.137 --> 01:48:48.460]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:49:03.118 --> 01:49:05.080]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:11.445]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[01:50:01.371 --> 01:50:08.334]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:50:08.574 --> 01:50:12.876]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:50:13.136 --> 01:50:18.238]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:50:18.738 --> 01:50:25.801]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:50:26.281 --> 01:50:31.225]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[01:50:31.665 --> 01:50:37.129]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:42.974]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[01:50:53.778 --> 01:51:07.124]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:51:07.804 --> 01:51:10.085]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:51:16.394 --> 01:51:18.555]  You know, I do have a news blitz coming up.
[01:51:18.795 --> 01:51:21.756]  All the day's news condensed down here at the end, so stay with us for that.
[01:51:22.737 --> 01:51:23.717]  But this is a big deal.
[01:51:23.757 --> 01:51:26.118]  Even if you don't have children, this is a great evil going on.
[01:51:26.138 --> 01:51:30.860]  It's all part of the secret police society where somebody just says something and then the life's ruined.
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:41.785]  It's like Hannah Montana, the girl that plays that, is now out saying pass the Cyber Bullying Act, where if you say something hurt your feelings, it's five years in prison, huge fine, federal felony.
[01:51:43.226 --> 01:51:45.869]  No fly lists, where you can't own guns now, all introduced.
[01:51:46.230 --> 01:51:47.631]  I mean, these people mean business.
[01:51:47.671 --> 01:51:49.333]  We've seen this in the Soviet Union before.
[01:51:50.575 --> 01:51:53.738]  The way they implement things is like the Soviet Union, with a little bit of Nazi.
[01:51:54.119 --> 01:51:56.502]  But the way they run the financial system is kind of like the Nazis.
[01:51:57.263 --> 01:52:00.707]  But the political system is like a Soviet communist system.
[01:52:01.863 --> 01:52:04.164]  And they've hired those people to consult and set this up.
[01:52:04.204 --> 01:52:05.465]  I mean, these are evil people.
[01:52:06.106 --> 01:52:07.386]  And they love being hard-hearted.
[01:52:07.406 --> 01:52:10.468]  Again, they're either trying to make money off the kids or they're pedophiles.
[01:52:10.988 --> 01:52:12.149]  Or they can't handle it and leave.
[01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:17.512]  Because there are some parents that are abusing and they have TV shows about it and rationalize it and make parents look bad.
[01:52:18.093 --> 01:52:22.095]  I'm going to give you, the Hays County Sheriff's Office is the main one in the school with the kids.
[01:52:22.155 --> 01:52:23.096]  These are the people to call.
[01:52:24.133 --> 01:52:24.874]  512-393-7800.
[01:52:25.454 --> 01:52:32.379]  Tell them shame on them strip searching a little girl and ordering her to take her pants off or she'd be getting in trouble.
[01:52:32.919 --> 01:52:34.540]  That's terrorism against a little girl.
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:35.761]  Shame on Hayes County.
[01:52:35.961 --> 01:52:37.742]  You're going to get a name as bad as Williamson County.
[01:52:38.202 --> 01:52:40.364]  What a group of boss hog dirtbags down there.
[01:52:40.424 --> 01:52:42.085]  I hear a lot of bad stuff about you guys.
[01:52:42.645 --> 01:52:43.946]  You really are shameful people.
[01:52:43.966 --> 01:52:44.006]  512-393-7800.
[01:52:46.728 --> 01:52:52.372]  You know, a lot of folks are moving out of Williamson County and stuff because you've got a bad name.
[01:52:52.392 --> 01:52:54.834]  I mean, I guess you want one, too.
[01:52:54.854 --> 01:52:58.377]  512-393-7800, Hays County Sheriff's Office.
[01:52:58.517 --> 01:52:59.418]  Shame on you!
[01:52:59.718 --> 01:53:03.741]  The American people know what you're doing in the great history of the Soviet Union.
[01:53:04.582 --> 01:53:06.883]  Shame on you, Sheriff!
[01:53:06.903 --> 01:53:06.943]  512-393-7800.
[01:53:07.023 --> 01:53:07.844]  Call them!
[01:53:08.044 --> 01:53:15.670]  Let them know the American people are aware of what's going on there at that Butte Elementary School and the sickening evil they're carrying out.
[01:53:18.332 --> 01:53:18.893]  512-393-7800.
[01:53:18.913 --> 01:53:23.797]  And it looks like they may be targeting Hispanics.
[01:53:23.817 --> 01:53:25.038]  512-393-7800.
[01:53:25.078 --> 01:53:36.049]  You call them and you tell them the whole world's watching, the lawyers are watching, and that these sheriff's deputies will be held liable individually if they engage in crime.
[01:53:36.069 --> 01:53:40.433]  Because I know they like to go into houses even without warrants and tase your people and make up lies.
[01:53:40.493 --> 01:53:41.654]  You're being watched closely.
[01:53:43.001 --> 01:53:44.562]  Your criminal activities are being watched.
[01:53:44.582 --> 01:53:47.963]  Put the criminal's number up there again.
[01:53:47.983 --> 01:53:48.123]  512-393-7800.
[01:53:48.183 --> 01:53:51.285]  And let's call the county commissioners.
[01:53:51.325 --> 01:53:51.945]  This is important.
[01:53:51.965 --> 01:53:53.606]  I want you to call all these ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:54.946 --> 01:53:55.967]  Had it here in my stack.
[01:53:56.887 --> 01:53:58.828]  I can't keep track of everything anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:02.136 --> 01:54:02.556]  Oh, here it is.
[01:54:02.576 --> 01:54:03.357]  It's under this stuff.
[01:54:04.377 --> 01:54:07.339]  Uh, Dr. Jeremy Lyons, superintendent of schools.
[01:54:07.359 --> 01:54:11.622]  I know this guy gets big federal bucks and, you know, is put in there as superintendent.
[01:54:12.222 --> 01:54:12.903]  At least most of them are.
[01:54:12.923 --> 01:54:18.266]  I don't know about him, but this is going on in his school, where they bring all the kids in and interrogate them and ask them about mommy and daddy.
[01:54:18.786 --> 01:54:19.787]  Try to do a dragnet.
[01:54:19.827 --> 01:54:22.068]  I mean, think of how evil that is, how un-American.
[01:54:22.528 --> 01:54:24.829]  Call up Dr. Dr. Jeremy Lyon.
[01:54:24.849 --> 01:54:30.872]  Probably one of these little guys with the breath mint who pimps around in his little suit and gets off on his lazy ass government job.
[01:54:30.912 --> 01:54:32.792]  Excuse me, I'm just sick of all you parasites.
[01:54:33.133 --> 01:54:36.714]  I know who you are.
[01:54:36.734 --> 01:54:37.315]  512-268-2141.
[01:54:37.335 --> 01:54:39.195]  That's the superintendent of schools.
[01:54:39.215 --> 01:54:39.475]  512-268-2141.
[01:54:39.556 --> 01:54:44.838]  And you tell them this is going to become a national civil rights case.
[01:54:45.118 --> 01:54:46.319]  Them strip-searching little girls.
[01:54:47.639 --> 01:54:50.802]  512, and who think of the other kids they've been doing stuff to, who God only knows.
[01:54:50.822 --> 01:54:51.823]  512-268-2141.
[01:54:52.604 --> 01:54:57.709]  We've talked to lawyers, you're supposed to by law to tell the parents what you did, but you didn't.
[01:54:57.729 --> 01:54:57.769]  512-268-2141.
[01:54:57.789 --> 01:54:58.890]  Lori Schroeder, Buda Principal, 512-268-8449.
[01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.950]  512-268-8449.
[01:54:58.970 --> 01:55:01.292]  And here is Hays County Departments.
[01:55:16.121 --> 01:55:17.605]  I want to call the County Commissioners.
[01:55:17.645 --> 01:55:18.467]  Where is that on here?
[01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:21.053]  So many of these stupid numbers.
[01:55:21.655 --> 01:55:24.602]  Adult Probation, Auditor, Civic Center, Commissioners Court.
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:29.221]  Call them, ask for all their extensions, ask for the county judge.
[01:55:29.241 --> 01:55:29.521]  512-393-2205.
[01:55:29.541 --> 01:55:30.821]  512-393-2205.
[01:55:31.301 --> 01:55:36.742]  We want to get a buzz going.
[01:55:37.102 --> 01:55:38.882]  They think they're doing all this stuff in the dark.
[01:55:38.902 --> 01:55:42.583]  Kind of like they've got a concentration camp out back, you know, nobody notices it.
[01:55:42.623 --> 01:55:43.523]  No, we're going to expose it.
[01:55:43.543 --> 01:55:43.883]  512-393-2205.
[01:55:43.903 --> 01:55:44.083]  512-393-2205.
[01:55:44.203 --> 01:55:47.584]  Ask to speak to the county commissioners, and then you tell them what's going on.
[01:55:59.131 --> 01:56:03.514]  Talk to the County Court of Law.
[01:56:03.534 --> 01:56:03.875]  512-393-7625.
[01:56:05.596 --> 01:56:07.978]  And that's basically some of the good numbers to call there.
[01:56:07.998 --> 01:56:10.119]  Guys, we're going to stand behind you on this.
[01:56:10.279 --> 01:56:12.781]  I've got the lawyer, my lawyer, recommended.
[01:56:13.221 --> 01:56:14.482]  We've got the other two folks.
[01:56:15.023 --> 01:56:15.963]  We're going to check it out.
[01:56:16.223 --> 01:56:17.564]  Probably go ahead and get you two lawyers.
[01:56:17.584 --> 01:56:18.325]  You see you've got two.
[01:56:18.845 --> 01:56:19.706]  You've got cameras.
[01:56:20.226 --> 01:56:21.047]  You've got materials.
[01:56:21.087 --> 01:56:26.291]  At the end of the show, we've got to talk to my lawyer, because he was reading the Riot Act, you know, off during the break.
[01:56:27.251 --> 01:56:28.132]  And God bless you.
[01:56:28.693 --> 01:56:29.333]  Thank you very much.
[01:56:29.733 --> 01:56:31.115]  You bet.
[01:56:31.135 --> 01:56:35.158]  Hey, I can't help everybody under attack, but I am sure going to help people that work here for me.
[01:56:36.019 --> 01:56:37.961]  And I appreciate all you, the listeners.
[01:56:38.021 --> 01:56:40.123]  And I know we spent three and a half hours on this today.
[01:56:41.063 --> 01:56:42.985]  It's just this is this is tyranny.
[01:56:43.085 --> 01:56:43.746]  This is what it is.
[01:56:43.786 --> 01:56:46.128]  And we've got to recognize it for what it is so we can defeat it.
[01:56:46.548 --> 01:56:47.649]  Please call all those numbers.
[01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:49.771]  A lot more news coming up.
[01:56:49.791 --> 01:56:50.192]  Stay with us.
[01:56:50.952 --> 01:56:51.873]  We're on the march.
[01:56:52.353 --> 01:56:53.855]  The empire's on the run.
[01:56:54.867 --> 01:56:57.669]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:00.970 --> 01:57:09.355]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:57:09.615 --> 01:57:14.017]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[01:57:14.457 --> 01:57:19.640]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:06.592]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:58:07.162 --> 01:58:14.227]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:58:14.747 --> 01:58:20.952]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:58:21.272 --> 01:58:23.173]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:58:23.313 --> 01:58:25.715]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:58:25.815 --> 01:58:36.763]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:58:37.387 --> 01:58:38.668]  It's not about left or right.
[01:58:39.048 --> 01:58:40.428]  It's about a one world government.
[01:58:40.908 --> 01:58:47.231]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:58:56.074 --> 01:58:57.234]  The Obama Deception.
[01:58:57.654 --> 01:58:58.835]  The people strike back.
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:01.981]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:59:02.041 --> 01:59:07.387]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:59:07.627 --> 01:59:12.251]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:59:12.652 --> 01:59:13.052]  It's true.
[01:59:13.132 --> 01:59:17.717]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:59:18.237 --> 01:59:22.942]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:59:23.462 --> 01:59:25.324]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:59:25.754 --> 01:59:30.357]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:59:30.557 --> 01:59:31.458]  And here's the best part.
[01:59:31.678 --> 01:59:34.440]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:38.043]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:59:38.363 --> 01:59:41.205]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:41.545 --> 01:59:43.446]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:43.767 --> 01:59:44.687]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:59:44.727 --> 01:59:44.927]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:59:44.967 --> 01:59:46.028]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:59:54.864 --> 01:59:57.066]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:59:57.386 --> 01:59:59.848]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:00:06.052 --> 02:00:10.796]  You know, Jesse Ventura has been all over radio and TV lately, and I'm good friends with him.
[02:00:11.336 --> 02:00:16.860]  Just hadn't thought to call and bug him, and I called and talked to his wife yesterday.
[02:00:16.901 --> 02:00:18.562]  He gets back today to Minnesota.
[02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:23.381]  He may be on later this week or next week, but we're going to get Ventura on, talk about a lot of stuff.
[02:00:24.121 --> 02:00:25.402]  About the waterboarding and the rest of it.
[02:00:25.422 --> 02:00:26.962]  I should have got him on before everybody else did.
[02:00:26.982 --> 02:00:27.802]  I knew he was coming back.
[02:00:29.023 --> 02:00:32.283]  He said, I'll be back in March or so.
[02:00:32.343 --> 02:00:34.084]  Have me on then for Mexico.
[02:00:34.844 --> 02:00:37.245]  Then I just forgot, here we are in May.
[02:00:39.766 --> 02:00:41.706]  So I should have got him on a month and a half ago, but that doesn't matter.
[02:00:41.726 --> 02:00:44.247]  A bunch of other big guests coming up later in the week.
[02:00:45.507 --> 02:00:48.228]  I got a big news blitz coming up here.
[02:00:48.288 --> 02:00:50.549]  Big stacks of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:00:50.569 --> 02:00:51.390]  We will cover that.
[02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:57.292]  Got off track today for three and a half hours because of what's happening to somebody here in my office with CPS.
[02:00:57.312 --> 02:01:04.336]  We already had this guest set up separately with what CPS is doing.
[02:01:04.376 --> 02:01:06.236]  Diane Miller, NationalHealthFreedom.org.
[02:01:08.524 --> 02:01:14.466]  Because Minnesota attorneys successfully helped to defend a Minnesota farmer from charges of practice of medicine without a license and all this other stuff.
[02:01:15.166 --> 02:01:21.868]  And there's all these cases where they'll grab kids, do chemotherapy, and then kill the kids with the chemotherapy.
[02:01:22.669 --> 02:01:26.290]  There's a Texas case we covered last year, and they finally won in court.
[02:01:27.335 --> 02:01:33.317]  This isn't like Christian science, but if you don't have your rights to not do stuff, then you have no rights, and they can force vaccines on you.
[02:01:33.777 --> 02:01:37.598]  This is cases where they admit the chemo won't even help, and then they still do it.
[02:01:38.418 --> 02:01:41.079]  This, in this case, has gotten national attention.
[02:01:41.099 --> 02:01:44.880]  In fact, here it is on Fox News, just came out today.
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:49.302]  Father asked mom, 13-year-old boy, resisting chemo, to come home.
[02:01:50.062 --> 02:01:52.502]  So we're talking right now to Diane Miller.
[02:01:52.542 --> 02:01:54.023]  Diane, what's the latest on this case?
[02:01:55.563 --> 02:02:12.994]  The latest is that the dad does not know where the mom and youth are and they did not appear at the hearing yesterday where they were going to be discussing how he would comply with the recommendations of a pediatric oncologist that does conventional care.
[02:02:15.456 --> 02:02:17.377]  And what is your relationship to this case?
[02:02:18.448 --> 02:02:21.790]  I am the National Director for National Health Freedom Coalition.
[02:02:21.810 --> 02:02:26.113]  We've been informally advising on the health freedom issues involved in the case.
[02:02:26.553 --> 02:02:30.095]  For those that don't know the case, can you specifically just boil it down for people?
[02:02:31.917 --> 02:02:38.421]  A child was diagnosed from a family physician, sent to a pediatric oncologist at Children's Hospital.
[02:02:38.441 --> 02:02:39.962]  They recommended chemotherapy.
[02:02:40.582 --> 02:02:45.065]  The parents did not want to do it, but they agreed to do a first round.
[02:02:45.786 --> 02:02:48.967]  And the first round was severe complications.
[02:02:49.007 --> 02:03:09.971]  The child was ended up in the hospital for 11 days with a large blood clot under his arm and up to his heart and couldn't walk and came home and rehabilitated for a couple weeks doing alternative health care and didn't want to go back to the rest of the chemotherapy and got a second opinion.
[02:03:09.991 --> 02:03:11.851]  Second opinion said do conventional care.
[02:03:12.749 --> 02:03:18.170]  And they reported him to child protection when the parents did not bring him back for the second round.
[02:03:18.210 --> 02:03:23.311]  So even when you get a second opinion, which in other cases they get from medical doctors, they say, we don't care.
[02:03:23.951 --> 02:03:25.892]  And you know, I had a dog got cancer.
[02:03:25.932 --> 02:03:27.332]  They gave it one chemo shot.
[02:03:27.352 --> 02:03:29.112]  He quit breathing and died within 10 minutes.
[02:03:29.732 --> 02:03:35.934]  And I know everybody else I know, a lot of times they find cancers aren't really cancers and they wipe them out with this stuff.
[02:03:35.954 --> 02:03:37.014]  This is quite an industry.
[02:03:37.874 --> 02:03:42.958]  Uh, and so, uh, you know, they don't want it, but I guess they, uh, and so where is this going now?
[02:03:44.179 --> 02:04:00.810]  Well, um, they put a warrant out for the mother and the child, um, to find them, uh, so that they can, in the county without the mother or child present, transferred custody to Brown County so that, uh, once they find the child, the county would, uh, force the issue.
[02:04:02.011 --> 02:04:03.772]  So they're hell-bent on killing this little boy.
[02:04:03.812 --> 02:04:04.433]  Tell us about him.
[02:04:04.943 --> 02:04:09.130]  Yeah, and the media is not carrying the defense.
[02:04:09.250 --> 02:04:10.993]  We had Dr. Norm Shealy testifying.
[02:04:11.033 --> 02:04:19.026]  He said that personally, himself, you couldn't give him a trillion dollars to take chemotherapy and discuss the side effects, the efficacy, and the
[02:04:20.004 --> 02:04:44.496]  uh... political uh... holding of the chemotherapy and these aren't just family saying no medical doctors all over saying it's basically rat poison and kills you doesn't help you they don't they don't care how many medical doctors you've got the state says we're gonna practice medicine the kid dies right and the laws in most states say that if doctors say anything outside of the recommended
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:49.181]  Uh, prevailing and accepted standards of care, they can lose their license.
[02:04:49.201 --> 02:04:51.981]  So basically in the United States there's a gag order on cancer cures.
[02:04:52.001 --> 02:04:54.342]  Yeah, I knew about that.
[02:04:54.442 --> 02:04:55.582]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:04:56.042 --> 02:04:58.703]  Um, so where, so, so the families disappeared though.
[02:04:58.723 --> 02:05:01.423]  They're, they're not gonna, I mean, I guess they are extremists.
[02:05:01.443 --> 02:05:02.484]  They don't want to kill their son.
[02:05:02.504 --> 02:05:03.384]  Right.
[02:05:03.644 --> 02:05:04.804]  They don't want to kill their son.
[02:05:04.904 --> 02:05:06.805]  They don't, they don't want to kill their son.
[02:05:06.905 --> 02:05:08.145]  That's basically what's going on.
[02:05:08.185 --> 02:05:11.506]  They're very well educated in alternative health there.
[02:05:11.666 --> 02:05:12.946]  They had a high learning curve.
[02:05:14.250 --> 02:05:16.233]  Researching everything they can get their hands on.
[02:05:16.274 --> 02:05:18.076]  They're looking at other clinics.
[02:05:18.096 --> 02:05:26.530]  They're doing all kinds of stuff to figure out how best to bring their son back in a state of wellness without giving him a toxic lethal substance.
[02:05:26.806 --> 02:05:29.348]  You know, I printed it and I couldn't find it in my stack from last night.
[02:05:29.368 --> 02:05:35.774]  A girl from Corpus Christi, we had her on like a year ago, and they grabbed her, she was fine, gave her chemotherapy, almost killed her.
[02:05:36.235 --> 02:05:38.176]  They fought and finally won in court.
[02:05:38.797 --> 02:05:39.518]  What's her name?
[02:05:39.538 --> 02:05:42.580]  Corpus Christi.
[02:05:43.481 --> 02:05:45.663]  I forget, but the point is, I've got it here in the stack.
[02:05:46.264 --> 02:05:50.648]  But I mean, there are some... In the Oklahoma lily rot case.
[02:05:51.599 --> 02:05:59.769]  Lily went to Switzerland to a hospital that the United States tried to extradite her back to the United States for a second round of chemo because the first one almost killed her so they left.
[02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:06.737]  And the Swiss doctors would not let her go because they said the amount of chemo that they would have given that child would be child abuse in Switzerland.
[02:06:08.621 --> 02:06:09.682]  Yeah, it's totally sick.
[02:06:10.102 --> 02:06:12.843]  I know, they abuse children and then call it abuse, not abusing them.
[02:06:13.504 --> 02:06:19.307]  For those that don't know, ma'am, researching this and the doctors you've had testify, tell folks what chemo is.
[02:06:19.327 --> 02:06:20.507]  Because, I mean, they love it.
[02:06:20.587 --> 02:06:22.688]  They can charge $10,000 for a bottle of Raid.
[02:06:22.708 --> 02:06:27.311]  I mean, explain to people why this is a mafia.
[02:06:27.851 --> 02:06:28.091]  Right.
[02:06:28.131 --> 02:06:33.474]  The cost of the first round of diagnostics and the chemo in one round was $92,000.
[02:06:34.194 --> 02:06:37.036]  And if a thousand people die of cancer every day in this country,
[02:06:37.458 --> 02:06:39.239]  And you know that most of them take chemo.
[02:06:39.319 --> 02:06:42.701]  It's just a billion dollar industry that's pumping money in every day.
[02:06:42.721 --> 02:06:48.483]  The drugs that they give usually target cancer cells.
[02:06:48.523 --> 02:06:50.464]  They kill developing cells.
[02:06:50.564 --> 02:06:52.505]  Some drugs kill all cells.
[02:06:52.905 --> 02:06:58.648]  And then they hope that enough cancer cells get killed that the person eventually survives and builds their own immune system.
[02:06:59.268 --> 02:07:00.449]  But the problem is that
[02:07:01.169 --> 02:07:08.232]  Most chemotherapies don't target a particular cell, so it's killing your immune system off, in general.
[02:07:08.833 --> 02:07:15.656]  In fact, I know a lot of people now dying of blood diseases, and they're dying five years after they took chemo.
[02:07:16.076 --> 02:07:16.276]  Right.
[02:07:16.296 --> 02:07:17.597]  It just totally fries your blood.
[02:07:17.957 --> 02:07:28.302]  Yep, they get heart failure, they get thyroid problems, sterilization, and they have a very high risk of getting leukemias and other blood disgraces after they have chemotherapy rounds.
[02:07:30.111 --> 02:07:35.973]  So, in our opinion, the parents are being extremely responsible in this case.
[02:07:36.033 --> 02:07:38.754]  They are like the opposite of neglect.
[02:07:39.155 --> 02:07:49.139]  They are empowered, they are critical thinkers, they are doing the best they can to do the analysis of what they want for their child, and that's what we want in America, and it's being totally trashed by
[02:07:50.982 --> 02:07:52.984]  Imposing a conventional standard of care.
[02:07:53.425 --> 02:08:11.743]  Basically the research drug companies do their own research projects then they promote their drugs and they say this was promoted for a cure and they say you don't have the numbers for your other natural remedies so it doesn't work and they're basically arguing that because you don't have big
[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:17.123]  Double blind studies or clinical trials that you can't do it.
[02:08:17.143 --> 02:08:19.345]  Though, as you know, you're an expert in this.
[02:08:19.385 --> 02:08:20.265]  That's phase one.
[02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:32.794]  Now they've been kind of defeated, so they're now patenting fish oil and patenting vitamin C and trying to then make governments where we can't have it over the counter, where we've got to then go pay $92,000 from them for some vitamin B12.
[02:08:32.834 --> 02:08:34.155]  That's right.
[02:08:34.215 --> 02:08:38.839]  They're going after the dietary supplement, chipping away at that for sure.
[02:08:38.859 --> 02:08:42.221]  They're trying to do it slowly so that we don't have a huge outcry.
[02:08:42.642 --> 02:08:53.370]  So they just do one little thing at a time that doesn't create enough, you know, so we're taking a resolution forward in this fall on the codex issues and that to stop some of that.
[02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:56.462]  Well, Diane, we really appreciate you joining us and you're a great guest.
[02:08:56.482 --> 02:08:58.123]  I want to have you back up for a full hour in the future.
[02:08:58.143 --> 02:08:59.303]  We're sorry for moving you earlier.
[02:08:59.343 --> 02:09:02.946]  I have CPS trying to kidnap one of my employee's daughters for absolutely no reason.
[02:09:02.966 --> 02:09:04.547]  Script searching or everything.
[02:09:04.627 --> 02:09:05.667]  It's total insanity.
[02:09:06.328 --> 02:09:08.149]  But how do we help this little boy?
[02:09:08.169 --> 02:09:09.470]  I guess there's nothing we can do.
[02:09:10.130 --> 02:09:13.292]  Hopefully the parents can hide him before the kidnappers get him.
[02:09:13.737 --> 02:09:20.921]  Alright, well the biggest thing I think is that this case is so constitutional that there should be appeals going and amicus briefs and whatever.
[02:09:21.061 --> 02:09:26.863]  And the attorney's law firm taking this case that took the case is a very small law firm with two attorneys.
[02:09:27.544 --> 02:09:31.726]  The lead attorney on it is Calvin Johnson, the one that did the Farmer case with me 15 years ago.
[02:09:32.146 --> 02:09:37.889]  So if you can support that law firm so that they can get another person on this case full-time,
[02:09:38.325 --> 02:09:41.246]  Then we can really take it all the way where it's supposed to go.
[02:09:41.666 --> 02:09:44.347]  Sure, I mean, I ran into precedent just last night in Texas.
[02:09:44.367 --> 02:09:47.348]  There was a state court in the case of this little girl.
[02:09:47.669 --> 02:09:53.391]  In fact, I was Googling fight CPS and found that article.
[02:09:53.671 --> 02:09:57.732]  I've had so many guests on, I forget them all, last night and I can't find it, guys.
[02:09:57.772 --> 02:10:00.774]  Type, Corpus Christi girl doesn't want chemo.
[02:10:01.274 --> 02:10:03.635]  And that should pull her up because I want to show people on screen.
[02:10:04.415 --> 02:10:07.317]  Yeah, and well, the thing is, she won her case.
[02:10:07.337 --> 02:10:11.560]  When I had her on like a year and a half ago, she was battling and she was fine.
[02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:13.661]  And then they gave her the chemo and almost killed her.
[02:10:13.681 --> 02:10:15.162]  You know, they kidnapped her, gave her chemo.
[02:10:15.182 --> 02:10:16.603]  They got an injuncture, got her back.
[02:10:17.084 --> 02:10:19.025]  And now it's a year and a half later and she's doing better.
[02:10:19.065 --> 02:10:19.825]  Her hair grew back.
[02:10:20.306 --> 02:10:23.088]  But there's still hell bent on going back to court trying to get her.
[02:10:23.108 --> 02:10:26.970]  So folks, folks can go to nationalhealthfreedom.org.
[02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:29.152]  No, that's not it.
[02:10:29.172 --> 02:10:32.114]  12 year old with cancer taken from her parents.
[02:10:32.874 --> 02:10:34.015]  Yeah, Corpus Christi girl.
[02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:38.571]  I don't know if that's it.
[02:10:38.591 --> 02:10:39.771]  Well, I'll try to send my stack.
[02:10:39.851 --> 02:10:40.612]  I'll try to dig it out.
[02:10:40.752 --> 02:10:43.774]  We had Billy Best at the trial, but the judge wouldn't let him testify.
[02:10:43.814 --> 02:10:48.717]  He ran away from chemotherapy and did 714X, which is just on the front in Canada.
[02:10:49.097 --> 02:10:50.718]  And he's fine today, and it was 10 years ago.
[02:10:51.179 --> 02:10:52.680]  Oh, tell folks that story briefly, then.
[02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:56.462]  Yeah, Billy Best is a teenager that ran away from chemotherapy.
[02:10:56.482 --> 02:10:59.624]  He wrote a book, The Boy Who Ran Away From Chemotherapy.
[02:11:00.025 --> 02:11:01.505]  He was at the trial the other day.
[02:11:01.526 --> 02:11:06.169]  He's a Native American, and they tried to force chemotherapy.
[02:11:07.941 --> 02:11:22.785]  His father eventually found him and got him across the border into Canada and he went to the 714x Gaston Nassance Clinic and got well and now is promoting his book and speaking and the judge would not let him testify.
[02:11:22.805 --> 02:11:24.545]  Because it was irrelevant.
[02:11:25.285 --> 02:11:26.466]  Yeah, irrelevant.
[02:11:27.106 --> 02:11:29.226]  What was the treatments they gave him that were successful?
[02:11:30.607 --> 02:11:36.188]  714x is an immune treatment customized for cancer in Canada.
[02:11:38.416 --> 02:11:39.817]  Well, of course we can't have that.
[02:11:41.138 --> 02:11:41.438]  Right.
[02:11:42.218 --> 02:11:45.300]  All over the world they're using 714X and we can't have it, right?
[02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:53.225]  And then when Billy came back to the United States and he wanted to get his 714X, they stopped all the shipments at the border of Canada and the United States.
[02:11:53.765 --> 02:11:55.506]  So he had to always go up there and get them.
[02:11:56.887 --> 02:12:07.593]  So he lived meagerly forever and still just, you know, it's just hard to be in a courtroom for him.
[02:12:08.326 --> 02:12:10.468]  And to watch the same thing happening to other youth.
[02:12:10.488 --> 02:12:16.534]  Well, yeah, because the globalists want globalism, so if a nation develops secure, they can go in and shut that down.
[02:12:16.554 --> 02:12:17.054]  That's right.
[02:12:17.074 --> 02:12:19.116]  That's what the New World Order is all about, eugenics.
[02:12:19.376 --> 02:12:20.718]  Have you discovered that in your research?
[02:12:22.079 --> 02:12:30.747]  I have personally, not through the National Health Freedom Coalition, but my personal views on that resonate very much with your radio show.
[02:12:31.403 --> 02:12:31.723]  All right.
[02:12:32.084 --> 02:12:33.545]  Well, Diane, you're a wonderful person.
[02:12:33.605 --> 02:12:36.066]  Folks can find a link to that law firm at nationalhealthfreedom.org.
[02:12:36.086 --> 02:12:37.508]  Thank you.
[02:12:37.748 --> 02:12:39.029]  Thank you so much for all your work.
[02:12:39.329 --> 02:12:39.609]  No, no.
[02:12:39.649 --> 02:12:40.209]  God bless you.
[02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:41.130]  Good to have you on with us.
[02:12:43.652 --> 02:12:49.496]  Folks, you know, I'm not going to apologize for doing three and a half hours on CPS today because it's a huge scourge.
[02:12:49.836 --> 02:12:54.180]  And I've thought a lot of times about doing whole show specials where we just focus in on one issue.
[02:12:55.621 --> 02:12:58.062]  I've done some of those on 9-11 and other things in the past.
[02:13:00.506 --> 02:13:04.748]  When I talked to this little girl yesterday, Hayley, I'm going to do a news bulletin in a moment and take some calls.
[02:13:05.528 --> 02:13:08.330]  I may even go into overdrive today because I've got to talk to the law firms.
[02:13:09.991 --> 02:13:10.871]  That's another frustration.
[02:13:10.911 --> 02:13:12.072]  I can't cover all the evil.
[02:13:13.973 --> 02:13:16.774]  I can't even explain all the evil, much less fight it all.
[02:13:20.436 --> 02:13:21.616]  But I'm telling you, it's the system.
[02:13:21.656 --> 02:13:24.358]  It's the judges and it's the government people.
[02:13:25.223 --> 02:13:28.265]  And it's the lazy society going along with this.
[02:13:28.305 --> 02:13:30.547]  I mean, they put cancer viruses in your vaccines, folks.
[02:13:30.607 --> 02:13:31.167]  It's on record.
[02:13:31.728 --> 02:13:32.969]  They brag and write books about it.
[02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:34.269]  It's real funny to them.
[02:13:35.370 --> 02:13:39.693]  And they got these dumb judges who will die of cancer themselves getting flu shots every year.
[02:13:39.713 --> 02:13:41.034]  They're not part of the conspiracy.
[02:13:41.414 --> 02:13:49.040]  They just know they get re-elected and the foundations give them money and the lobbyists give them money and they do all this evil.
[02:13:50.307 --> 02:13:51.648]  And they kind of spread the risk.
[02:13:51.668 --> 02:13:53.129]  They all do a little piece of the evil.
[02:13:53.149 --> 02:14:02.415]  They all kind of, kind of like they sell derivatives and then triple certify them and have insurance companies certify them and then they sell those certifications as derivatives.
[02:14:02.435 --> 02:14:05.017]  You know, it's like just a whole, it's like Enron.
[02:14:05.057 --> 02:14:10.481]  A bunch of criminals kind of all plausibly denying what they're doing and then this goes on.
[02:14:11.542 --> 02:14:13.003]  And I mean, I couldn't sleep last night.
[02:14:13.023 --> 02:14:14.424]  I'm getting to the point where I can't eat.
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:22.570]  I'm at the point where I can't sleep, I keep waking up because, I mean, I care about these kids, I care about them, there's nothing more important than families.
[02:14:24.072 --> 02:14:28.239]  And they say families yelling at each other, they'll take your kids, that's not against the law, that's what everybody does.
[02:14:28.279 --> 02:14:31.023]  Look at how dysfunctional the government is, a million times worse.
[02:14:33.232 --> 02:14:34.413]  And look, the truth is the truth.
[02:14:34.453 --> 02:14:40.457]  When I tell you that when I've gone and confronted CPS and fought them, it's always a bunch of pot-bellied pedophile types.
[02:14:40.497 --> 02:14:41.818]  A bunch of Nelly pedophiles.
[02:14:41.858 --> 02:14:43.039]  And I'm sick of you bastards.
[02:14:43.739 --> 02:14:45.200]  I mean, I hope you go straight to hell.
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:49.363]  I'm sorry to talk like that for everybody, but I mean, that's what I think and I'm going to say it.
[02:14:52.865 --> 02:14:54.006]  I want to bring you down bad.
[02:14:56.267 --> 02:14:58.149]  I mean, I'd give my life to bring you people down.
[02:14:59.456 --> 02:15:01.158]  And I don't care what the media does to me.
[02:15:01.178 --> 02:15:02.439]  I don't care how I'm attacked.
[02:15:02.479 --> 02:15:03.699]  I don't care what goes on.
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:06.402]  I'm not afraid of any of you and I'm committed to the end.
[02:15:07.022 --> 02:15:09.504]  I'm committed to this and I'm asking God for providence.
[02:15:10.144 --> 02:15:11.565]  I know there's a lot of good people out there.
[02:15:11.625 --> 02:15:12.226]  I know there are.
[02:15:12.526 --> 02:15:15.048]  There's a lot more than there were in Sodom and Gomorrah.
[02:15:16.469 --> 02:15:20.192]  And I'm asking God to give me the help and give the listeners the help to fight these people.
[02:15:21.872 --> 02:15:28.114]  And even if you don't believe in God and you're some atheist, I mean, is it okay to let the government play in control, freak, and violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[02:15:28.354 --> 02:15:29.194]  Is it bad, too?
[02:15:29.414 --> 02:15:30.455]  I mean, is everything bad?
[02:15:31.255 --> 02:15:35.116]  Live free or die, folks, because there's no point in living as a slave.
[02:15:35.957 --> 02:15:39.678]  But if you have the attitude that you're ready to die for freedom, then you'll have freedom!
[02:15:39.898 --> 02:15:41.458]  But if you cower, you're going to lose it.
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:48.861]  You know, here I'm telling this family, I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I'm advising you
[02:15:51.138 --> 02:15:52.559]  To stand up and fight these people.
[02:15:53.119 --> 02:15:54.040]  And they did the right thing.
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:56.101]  But most people don't have the courage to do that.
[02:15:56.121 --> 02:15:58.323]  And you notice all the lawyers agree with what I told them yesterday.
[02:15:59.292 --> 02:16:01.232]  Does that mean it's a perfectly safe course?
[02:16:01.332 --> 02:16:02.033]  No, nothing is.
[02:16:02.353 --> 02:16:02.893]  Look at this news.
[02:16:03.173 --> 02:16:06.034]  Corporate Media Exploits Teen Idol to Push Cyberbullying Bill.
[02:16:06.314 --> 02:16:06.774]  Curt Nemo.
[02:16:06.834 --> 02:16:08.934]  I should have talked about this all day, but I had to cover the other.
[02:16:09.634 --> 02:16:16.996]  How they're setting up no-fly list, no-gun-buy list, no-travel list, no-tracker list, no-work list, no-credit list, no-fly list.
[02:16:17.016 --> 02:16:17.816]  You've got bad credit.
[02:16:17.876 --> 02:16:18.736]  It's all being announced.
[02:16:19.356 --> 02:16:25.778]  Reuters is reporting like it's a good thing, making you feel sorry for somebody called Teen Idol, Miley Cyrus, who's
[02:16:27.372 --> 02:16:29.713]  Some Hannah Montana stupid thing.
[02:16:29.733 --> 02:16:30.914]  I haven't really paid attention to it.
[02:16:31.514 --> 02:16:36.777]  Some icon that she goes, people call me fat.
[02:16:36.837 --> 02:16:37.638]  I want them arrested.
[02:16:37.678 --> 02:16:42.180]  And it says, oh, felony charges if you criticize anyone on the Internet or free speech.
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:43.221]  I mean, no more free speech.
[02:16:43.461 --> 02:16:44.661]  Forget hate crimes laws.
[02:16:44.862 --> 02:16:46.502]  This is just no free speech, period.
[02:16:46.542 --> 02:16:50.625]  Introduced with Reuters and MTV and Disney and everybody promoting it.
[02:16:51.305 --> 02:16:52.846]  I mean, it's happening.
[02:16:55.422 --> 02:16:58.505]  Oh, gotta get that out to people.
[02:17:00.246 --> 02:17:04.049]  Government critics to be sent to mental asylums.
[02:17:04.609 --> 02:17:05.650]  This is being reported on.
[02:17:05.670 --> 02:17:11.735]  And this is out of England.
[02:17:11.775 --> 02:17:18.560]  The government has established a secretive new police unit with the powers to detain anyone any length of time without any due process.
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:19.581]  A shadowy unit called
[02:17:21.445 --> 02:17:25.327]  Fixated Threat Assessment Center, FTAC, was covertly established in 2006.
[02:17:25.627 --> 02:17:28.568]  The unit includes the services of a police psychiatrist.
[02:17:29.329 --> 02:17:30.609]  Because see, then it's all this craziness.
[02:17:30.869 --> 02:17:32.090]  We say you're mentally ill.
[02:17:32.370 --> 02:17:34.551]  You're going away after we drug you for a few years.
[02:17:34.871 --> 02:17:37.032]  They did that to that doctor in Kansas City, remember?
[02:17:37.512 --> 02:17:39.133]  Who was criticized in the government, so they grabbed him.
[02:17:39.173 --> 02:17:42.214]  I think nine years later, they're still forcibly drugging him with antipsychotics.
[02:17:42.475 --> 02:17:43.535]  He's like a vegetable now.
[02:17:44.015 --> 02:17:45.436]  No judge, no jury, no arrest.
[02:17:46.516 --> 02:17:47.677]  Why, for one good reason.
[02:17:48.077 --> 02:17:49.138]  And one good reason only.
[02:17:49.158 --> 02:17:50.600]  Psychiatrists operate above the law.
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:52.101]  They can detain anyone at any time.
[02:17:53.002 --> 02:17:54.103]  See, they're the new priesthood.
[02:17:54.363 --> 02:17:57.085]  We'll do a news blitz, maybe jam in a few calls.
[02:17:57.506 --> 02:18:00.188]  Richard in Australia, Steven in Texas, others.
[02:18:00.869 --> 02:18:01.750]  This is all out of control.
[02:18:01.770 --> 02:18:06.994]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[02:18:07.475 --> 02:18:08.175]  Think about that.
[02:18:08.235 --> 02:18:10.838]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[02:18:11.338 --> 02:18:14.281]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[02:18:14.541 --> 02:18:24.349]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables and antioxidants.
[02:18:24.809 --> 02:18:30.374]  Unlike hard to digest pills, Chews for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[02:18:30.634 --> 02:18:31.655]  The choice is yours.
[02:18:31.795 --> 02:18:37.059]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[02:18:37.419 --> 02:18:38.120]  Chews for Health.
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:42.041]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:19:08.010 --> 02:19:13.355]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:19:13.875 --> 02:19:20.081]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:19:20.381 --> 02:19:22.202]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:19:22.362 --> 02:19:24.745]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:19:24.825 --> 02:19:35.694]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:19:38.001 --> 02:19:39.242]  It's not about left or right.
[02:19:39.662 --> 02:19:41.043]  It's about a one world government.
[02:19:41.523 --> 02:19:47.847]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:19:48.428 --> 02:19:56.213]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:19:56.693 --> 02:19:57.854]  The Obama Deception.
[02:19:58.274 --> 02:19:59.455]  The people strike back.
[02:20:01.408 --> 02:20:03.249]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:08.571]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:20:08.752 --> 02:20:10.072]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:20:10.352 --> 02:20:18.516]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:20:18.756 --> 02:20:24.459]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:20:24.659 --> 02:20:26.441]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:20:26.481 --> 02:20:28.663]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:20:28.683 --> 02:20:33.027]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:20:33.207 --> 02:20:35.329]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:20:35.429 --> 02:20:43.316]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:20:43.376 --> 02:20:44.096]  We're good to go.
[02:21:16.178 --> 02:21:17.960]  The government is giving us cancer.
[02:21:19.781 --> 02:21:21.182]  The government is enslaving us.
[02:21:21.262 --> 02:21:22.283]  The government is corrupt.
[02:21:22.303 --> 02:21:23.144]  The government is evil.
[02:21:23.164 --> 02:21:24.325]  The government is sickening.
[02:21:24.425 --> 02:21:25.566]  It's filthy.
[02:21:25.826 --> 02:21:26.967]  And I need you, the listeners.
[02:21:27.167 --> 02:21:30.390]  Because we're the best there is, and that ain't saying much.
[02:21:31.651 --> 02:21:32.792]  Spread the word about this show.
[02:21:32.812 --> 02:21:34.774]  If you're listening on AM and FM stations, spread the word.
[02:21:36.288 --> 02:21:38.109]  You're listening on satellite, shortwave internet.
[02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:40.491]  You may be listening on an AM and FM station.
[02:21:40.511 --> 02:21:44.374]  Your cousin in another state will have internet even if there's not an AM or FM in their area.
[02:21:45.195 --> 02:21:48.378]  Don't forget the free podcast at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:48.438 --> 02:21:52.040]  You can download every day.
[02:21:53.141 --> 02:21:54.202]  We need to reach more people.
[02:21:54.242 --> 02:21:55.944]  The stuff being discussed here is too important.
[02:21:56.064 --> 02:21:56.344]  And look,
[02:21:57.711 --> 02:21:59.853]  Tomorrow and the next day, I think I'm going to clear the decks.
[02:21:59.893 --> 02:22:01.193]  I know we've got some big guests coming up.
[02:22:01.254 --> 02:22:02.895]  Just to take calls and get to everybody.
[02:22:03.835 --> 02:22:06.197]  Because I say I'm opening the phones up and then we get stuck with them.
[02:22:06.217 --> 02:22:07.938]  We've had like five, six guests in here today.
[02:22:09.499 --> 02:22:10.540]  And gone over all this.
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:12.141]  And there's just so much news.
[02:22:12.982 --> 02:22:13.923]  So much going on.
[02:22:13.983 --> 02:22:14.763]  So much happening.
[02:22:14.783 --> 02:22:23.990]  And I get completely distracted just by them trying to kidnap this eight-year-old girl that works here in the office for a bruise that big down her thigh.
[02:22:25.691 --> 02:22:26.732]  You know, that clearly is from
[02:22:28.058 --> 02:22:29.858]  Some cornered object, a table.
[02:22:30.659 --> 02:22:32.559]  That's how crazy this society has gotten.
[02:22:32.579 --> 02:22:35.259]  They'll ruin lives and they do it with absolute pleasure.
[02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:48.962]  And then they're announcing they're going to make the automakers put out these cars and it shows them that they look like they weigh 50 pounds and they're not going to let you have cars anymore that are big or nice.
[02:22:48.982 --> 02:22:50.742]  I mean, you know, it's just total control.
[02:22:50.862 --> 02:22:53.423]  America is imploding and meanwhile
[02:22:54.707 --> 02:23:04.396]  You know, they give $20-30 billion to car makers so they control them and say what cars will look like, but then they say, we're giving $14.8 trillion to foreign banks and no one can know where the money went.
[02:23:06.098 --> 02:23:10.862]  Meanwhile, the WHO is running around saying the flu is going to kill everybody and they need forced inoculations in the fall.
[02:23:12.063 --> 02:23:13.365]  I mean, this is all happening.
[02:23:13.525 --> 02:23:16.828]  H1N1 flu, deaths and cases edge higher.
[02:23:16.908 --> 02:23:18.089]  WHO considers going to level 6.
[02:23:19.269 --> 02:23:23.472]  The end of the great American gas guzzler as Obama gets set to unveil the toughest U.S.
[02:23:23.492 --> 02:23:25.153]  policy ever on fuel efficiency.
[02:23:27.155 --> 02:23:29.236]  California voters kill budget measures.
[02:23:30.037 --> 02:23:30.937]  That's a tax revolt.
[02:23:30.957 --> 02:23:32.698]  They say, we don't care if you shut the government down.
[02:23:32.819 --> 02:23:33.679]  No more taxes!
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.182]  Schwarzenegger, that piece of trash, is failing.
[02:23:37.862 --> 02:23:39.864]  Obama's new rules will transform U.S.
[02:23:39.964 --> 02:23:40.544]  auto fleets.
[02:23:40.624 --> 02:23:41.224]  Shut it down.
[02:23:42.726 --> 02:23:44.587]  You know, this is the type of stuff I've got here.
[02:23:49.893 --> 02:23:54.696]  I just, I see these type of articles every day in the news and never get to them.
[02:23:55.496 --> 02:24:02.560]  This is an article about a city council telling citizens they can't have websites criticizing council members and telling them it's illegal.
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:09.684]  Like I see these reports where judges have people arrested for political signs criticizing them outside their jurisdiction as if they could do it inside.
[02:24:09.704 --> 02:24:11.625]  I mean, government thinks it's God.
[02:24:11.685 --> 02:24:13.386]  It's gotten way too big for its britches.
[02:24:14.548 --> 02:24:18.573]  It's not enough to ship the drugs in, the heroin, the cocaine, to put cancer viruses on our vaccines.
[02:24:18.854 --> 02:24:22.358]  Now you gotta have all our kids now, because you can't kill them with cancer viruses quick enough.
[02:24:23.499 --> 02:24:24.921]  And I know a lot of you can't deal with that.
[02:24:25.081 --> 02:24:25.923]  That's the reality.
[02:24:26.183 --> 02:24:27.485]  It's out, it's public, it's there.
[02:24:27.745 --> 02:24:28.426]  You want to look it up.
[02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:32.881]  City Council says no website.
[02:24:32.921 --> 02:24:38.063]  City administrators have sent a letter to a local website operator ordering her to remove information related to municipal offices.
[02:24:38.083 --> 02:24:40.464]  City Council members learned Monday's work session.
[02:24:40.904 --> 02:24:44.206]  And they got the mayor in here saying, you're not allowed to criticize the government.
[02:24:44.666 --> 02:24:46.987]  I will have you arrested if you don't follow this.
[02:24:47.487 --> 02:24:48.407]  Just cuckoo!
[02:24:49.088 --> 02:24:49.748]  Cuckoo!
[02:24:49.848 --> 02:24:50.749]  You're cuckoo!
[02:24:51.149 --> 02:24:52.769]  You're not God!
[02:24:52.789 --> 02:24:55.791]  Alright, I'm sorry to the callers.
[02:24:55.851 --> 02:24:56.971]  I didn't get to you then this hour.
[02:24:57.251 --> 02:24:58.432]  I'll be back tomorrow live.
[02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:02.301]  If there's new developments, I'll be on with Bernstein at midnight tonight.
[02:25:03.142 --> 02:25:04.363]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 3.

[02:25:17.891 --> 02:25:18.851]  Didn't even do it again today.
[02:25:19.572 --> 02:25:20.772]  And it's becoming a problem.
