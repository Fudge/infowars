[00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:02.489]  Engage!
[00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:05.951]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:07.652]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.392 --> 00:00:09.513]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:10.954]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:12.634]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:16.936]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.457 --> 00:00:21.579]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:27.942]  There are many rules.
[00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:34.631]  To living in a dictatorship of the bankers, to living in a tyranny, to living under despotism.
[00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:58.745]  But one of the most important rules, probably the cardinal rule of tyranny, is to criminalize the non-criminal, to make everything criminal, to pass so many laws that no one even knows what the laws and regulations and bureaucracies are, and all the new little fake courts and bureaucracies, to where everyone at any time can be investigated and imprisoned or fined and feed to the tyranny.
[00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:05.551]  And thousands of laws are being passed criminalizing all behavior, basically.
[00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:11.995]  Or, there's not even a law that you have to be vaccinated, but if you don't vaccinate your kids, they'll CPS them in many cases.
[00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:19.639]  Or there's no law that you can't yell at your children or even spank them, but they imprison you and take your children when there is no law.
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.040]  That's on record.
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.202]  See, this is what a tyranny is.
[00:01:23.222 --> 00:01:28.445]  And they have their administrative law courts, they have these family law courts that are really the eugenics law courts set up.
[00:01:29.343 --> 00:01:31.624]  In the last hundred years in the Western world.
[00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:33.326]  That's all historical fact.
[00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:55.279]  And so, I covered this article in the last hour, Government Demands Inventory of All VFW Weapons, and it says we don't care if it's a Spanish-American war, civil war, we don't care if it's over a hundred years old, we will send the BATF and the FBI with SWAT teams for stolen military equipment.
[00:01:57.848 --> 00:02:00.751]  Swords, knives, tanks, missiles.
[00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:02.893]  The Fed said, we want to give you decommissioned.
[00:02:03.293 --> 00:02:05.815]  And you see a lot of them gifted by the U.S.
[00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:07.517]  Army, the VFW chapter.
[00:02:07.537 --> 00:02:12.461]  And you drive through small towns and see the VFW and there'll be a helicopter and a tank.
[00:02:14.203 --> 00:02:20.569]  Or there'll be a missile, or there'll be an old howitzer, or there'll be a World War I gun, or there'll be a Spanish-American war gun, or there'll be a
[00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:24.988]  Gun of the Confederacy next to a gun of the... You see them everywhere.
[00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:25.988]  You see them at the capitals.
[00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:31.392]  They'll even have Revolutionary War cannons at some of the state capitals.
[00:02:32.532 --> 00:02:35.354]  Some of the mortars, you know, little cannons pointing straight up.
[00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:38.436]  Old-fashioned mortar was just a cannon at an angle.
[00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:43.819]  And so nobody has these records.
[00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:49.482]  These guys are in there grilling steaks and hamburgers and drinking beer and playing poker and 42 dominoes.
[00:02:52.486 --> 00:02:54.708]  I mean, that's what's going on at the VFW, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:54.728 --> 00:03:01.793]  They're talking about deer hunting, they're talking about, you know, whose house they're renovating, and, you know, their construction job, and now their kid just got into A&M.
[00:03:02.374 --> 00:03:05.657]  They're not... and they're there worshiping the government and whatever it says.
[00:03:05.997 --> 00:03:06.737]  They're good people.
[00:03:07.538 --> 00:03:09.560]  They're just completely ignorant, on average.
[00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:15.746]  Well, now the Homeland Security document comes out and says veterans the number one threat, gun owners the number one threat.
[00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:16.567]  It's public.
[00:03:16.627 --> 00:03:17.788]  I told you, you're the enemy.
[00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.791]  They know you're not going to go along with what's about to happen in this country.
[00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:22.192]  This is really happening.
[00:03:23.053 --> 00:03:27.096]  And so we went over this entire document earlier.
[00:03:27.136 --> 00:03:28.978]  Did you guys print me this document like I was asking?
[00:03:29.018 --> 00:03:33.882]  I forgot at home to print the actual document on the Government Demands Inventory of all VFW weapons.
[00:03:33.902 --> 00:03:35.544]  We have the document and the inventory form.
[00:03:36.377 --> 00:03:37.878]  Print that for me, because I want to show that.
[00:03:38.358 --> 00:03:40.019]  Or you can go to the website and just click on it, actually.
[00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:43.081]  We need to show people that way, because we just started simulcasting.
[00:03:43.762 --> 00:03:49.005]  We're going to simulcast for three hours today on the four-hour radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:03:49.025 --> 00:03:54.089]  So I need to add, we are simulcasting right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:00.293]  We normally do the third and fourth hour, but a lot of days we do the whole four hours, or more often than not we do three hours of the show.
[00:04:00.913 --> 00:04:01.514]  Ron Paul,
[00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.781]  Has never joined me from basically the floor of the house.
[00:04:07.582 --> 00:04:23.813]  But he's got, he was scheduled for a week, as he's scheduled every month, to be on with us at 12.30 Central Standard Time, 1.30 Eastern, and they're in floor debates right now, and he wants to get up and speak about the bill to audit the Fed that's got over 200 sponsors right now.
[00:04:24.153 --> 00:04:26.855]  Key story up on PrisonPlanet.com from Steve Watson.
[00:04:27.998 --> 00:04:36.429]  And we're going to have Ron Paul with his cell phone from somewhere in the gallery or the rotunda there, calling in sometime in the hour.
[00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.292]  So, heads up on that.
[00:04:39.073 --> 00:04:42.076]  And maybe an abbreviated interview as well, so we'll have to get back with him soon.
[00:04:43.464 --> 00:04:57.719]  Because duty calls, as they say, on the front lines of the legislative fight against our occupiers, the dictators, the private, criminal, central bank, Federal Reserve, now being subpoenaed by Congress.
[00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:00.022]  See, this idea of subpoenaing them is now out there.
[00:05:00.788 --> 00:05:09.452]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:14.595]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:17.616]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[00:05:18.056 --> 00:05:18.357]  I think so.
[00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:45.583]  Marine Photoplankton, Maca, Goji Berries, Raw Chocolate Cacao, Nibs, Noni, Immune Detox, and more.
[00:05:45.883 --> 00:05:47.443]  Folks, you gotta check these out.
[00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:54.125]  These foods promote nutritional excellence, health and well-being, beauty enhancement, and sustainable rainforest agriculture.
[00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:56.765]  Go to AmericanSuperfoods.com.
[00:05:57.025 --> 00:05:59.906]  Again, the website is AmericanSuperfoods.com.
[00:06:00.598 --> 00:06:06.164]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:06:06.464 --> 00:06:07.625]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:11.750]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.592]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:06:13.912 --> 00:06:18.777]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award.
[00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.610]  We're good to go.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.922]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:06:42.142 --> 00:06:43.162]  And take it from me, folks.
[00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:44.403]  It really does taste great.
[00:06:44.623 --> 00:06:46.384]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:06:46.705 --> 00:06:52.188]  Go to www.enerfood.com.
[00:06:52.408 --> 00:06:56.871]  That's www.enerfood.com.

[00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:03.235]  Phone rings and the questions are asked.
[00:07:03.515 --> 00:07:04.456]  I've been so sick.
[00:07:04.756 --> 00:07:06.157]  Will the Life Change Tea help me?
[00:07:06.437 --> 00:07:07.818]  Our answer is always the same.
[00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:13.956]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water, and air are attacking you this very moment.
[00:07:14.416 --> 00:07:19.897]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[00:07:20.298 --> 00:07:24.519]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:25.779]  We use results.
[00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:30.681]  Life Change Tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:35.222]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[00:07:35.595 --> 00:07:39.058]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:42.920]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:47.844]  Our number is 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[00:07:48.304 --> 00:07:49.345]  Again, that's 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[00:07:51.306 --> 00:07:54.949]  Or you can order online at GetTheTee.com.

[00:07:57.611 --> 00:08:00.213]  And remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:09.834]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.474 --> 00:08:11.295]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:12.955]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.616 --> 00:08:17.257]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.817 --> 00:08:21.919]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:27.922]  This is very exciting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:28.002 --> 00:08:30.323]  Think about the successes we've had.
[00:08:32.406 --> 00:08:35.869]  Nobody knew the Federal Reserve was private 15, 20 years ago.
[00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.290]  I mean, maybe 1% of the public.
[00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.933]  Now, it is beginning to become a majority.
[00:08:42.013 --> 00:08:43.655]  It's huge issues all over the news.
[00:08:43.995 --> 00:08:49.659]  They can't hide the fact it hasn't been audited in over 50 years.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.903]  They can't hide the fact that it's an offshore private bank now, and that it's been stealing all this money.
[00:08:55.384 --> 00:08:57.766]  They can't hide the fact that all the gold's gone from Fort Knox.
[00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.730]  They can't hide the fact that we've been shanghaied.
[00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:11.633]  There was a corporate takeover in 1913, and they've slowly been expanding to take over the states and our society, and now they're figuring out we're awake to them, so they're just trying to steal everything at one time.
[00:09:11.953 --> 00:09:16.954]  And they think, arrogantly, that the public's so stupid that we're not going to bring them to justice.
[00:09:16.994 --> 00:09:20.895]  Well, we are going to bring the New World Order to justice, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:24.596]  And I'm going to cover Bill to audit the Federal Reserve, now has 207 co-sponsors,
[00:09:26.756 --> 00:09:30.658]  Steve Watson, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net.
[00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:34.540]  Key story that everybody needs to read and see.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.440]  This is so exciting.
[00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:38.202]  And even if it doesn't pass this time, they only need like 11 more.
[00:09:40.323 --> 00:09:43.644]  Even if it doesn't pass, this has gone from when he used to introduce this 10 years ago.
[00:09:43.664 --> 00:09:48.367]  I remember interviewing Ron Paul in 1996 when he introduced these bills, when he first got back in Congress.
[00:09:48.627 --> 00:09:49.748]  He'd been there for one stint in the 70s.
[00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:53.596]  And he would have like three or four sponsors.
[00:09:54.296 --> 00:09:58.918]  He's now 207, and people are blowing their phones off the hook.
[00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:09.322]  And even if they say no, and don't pass it, people are saying, wait a minute, we can't audit them, we can't question them, we can't find out what this private group that says it's above the law is doing?
[00:10:11.322 --> 00:10:13.643]  Here's Forbes and AP today.
[00:10:14.484 --> 00:10:16.804]  Congress subpoenas fed over a Bank of America deal.
[00:10:17.265 --> 00:10:17.725]  Here's AP.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.580]  I mean, this is everywhere.
[00:10:21.261 --> 00:10:22.581]  Congress subpoenas the Fed.
[00:10:26.983 --> 00:10:31.005]  Before, it was this mind game trick of saying, the Federal Reserve doesn't handle money.
[00:10:31.045 --> 00:10:32.725]  The Federal Reserve doesn't tell the IRS what to do.
[00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:35.987]  You just write your check to the Federal Reserve when you pay the IRS.
[00:10:36.307 --> 00:10:37.647]  The Federal Reserve's not offshore.
[00:10:37.687 --> 00:10:39.788]  The Federal Reserve's audited.
[00:10:40.068 --> 00:10:40.788]  All lies.
[00:10:41.049 --> 00:10:41.489]  All lies.
[00:10:41.789 --> 00:10:44.050]  Now they've switched to, yeah, okay, we're above the law, big deal.
[00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:46.236]  And people are calling their bluff.
[00:10:46.496 --> 00:10:47.977]  And now Bernanke isn't arrogant.
[00:10:48.017 --> 00:10:50.118]  The bankers aren't arrogant now when you see them before Congress.
[00:10:50.438 --> 00:10:51.438]  They are freaked out.
[00:10:51.758 --> 00:10:52.899]  And they all need to go to prison.
[00:10:53.399 --> 00:11:02.604]  And it's because I've been calling for them to go to prison, and so has Ron Paul on this show, that I'm getting death threats, dirty tricks, extortion, harassment, and I'm not going to get into it on air.
[00:11:02.724 --> 00:11:05.505]  It's just, believe me folks, we are under attack.
[00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:07.126]  And it is intensifying.
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.145]  It is intensifying, so pray for us, support us, support the money bomb tomorrow.
[00:11:12.465 --> 00:11:14.067]  Think of how far we've come just on this!
[00:11:14.527 --> 00:11:17.311]  And they've tried to pass all these blanket amnesty plans.
[00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:18.151]  Those all fail.
[00:11:18.572 --> 00:11:21.335]  They've tried to pass all these gun confiscation bills.
[00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:22.056]  Those are failing.
[00:11:23.938 --> 00:11:26.101]  And they always come back and fight back, but we're fighting back.
[00:11:26.141 --> 00:11:27.742]  We're finding our fighting spirit here.
[00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:28.804]  This is historical.
[00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:43.804]  So I'm going to get back into Congress, subpoenas the Fed, the bill to audit the Fed, all that's coming up with Ron Paul, but the top story today was going to be what's happening right now with audit the private Federal Reserve.
[00:11:43.824 --> 00:11:45.145]  That is huge, that is historical.
[00:11:45.665 --> 00:11:47.106]  God knows what tricks they're going to play.
[00:11:47.827 --> 00:11:51.189]  Starting new wars, staging terror attacks, who knows, to get our minds off this.
[00:11:52.028 --> 00:11:53.149]  I mean, they're criminals.
[00:11:53.189 --> 00:11:54.090]  We're calling her bluff.
[00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.871]  They're con artists.
[00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:55.632]  It's a fraud.
[00:11:55.852 --> 00:11:57.173]  The government's illegitimate.
[00:11:57.393 --> 00:11:58.454]  It's not our republic.
[00:11:59.295 --> 00:12:01.377]  All we gotta do is point this out and get the word out.
[00:12:01.437 --> 00:12:02.298]  They will fail.
[00:12:02.738 --> 00:12:09.265]  Police and military are waiting for us to have the strength, politically, so they can somewhat more safely come out and tell the truth.
[00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:10.946]  I say, throw caution to the wind.
[00:12:11.607 --> 00:12:13.609]  Justice be done by the heavens falls, I love to say.
[00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:14.829]  I am committed to this.
[00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:30.621]  The enemy would be completely defeated if all the real men and women out there would stop having their teeth chattering, their knees knocking, and would commit to the cause of liberty 110% and sign your John Hancock on this new Declaration of Independence and Liberty against the technocratic eugenicist elite.
[00:12:32.463 --> 00:12:33.143]  But that's coming up.
[00:12:33.163 --> 00:12:35.385]  But I want to just tell you right now, you can read the documents,
[00:12:36.826 --> 00:12:39.748]  You can go to InfoWars.com.
[00:12:39.789 --> 00:12:42.171]  In fact, go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, guys.
[00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:44.252]  Punch us up on PrisonPlanet.tv for people.
[00:12:46.254 --> 00:12:47.175]  There are the documents.
[00:12:48.676 --> 00:12:49.877]  And I'm going to read this to people right now.
[00:12:49.957 --> 00:12:50.878]  Punch that up on screen.
[00:12:53.513 --> 00:12:59.835]  Government-issued Weapons and Equipment Inventory Form, and of course, registering is always to confiscate, PDF.
[00:13:00.435 --> 00:13:04.157]  VFW District and Post Government-issued Weapons and Equipment Inventory.
[00:13:04.457 --> 00:13:05.257]  Commanders.
[00:13:05.717 --> 00:13:06.698]  This has never been done before.
[00:13:06.738 --> 00:13:07.358]  Why is it happening now?
[00:13:08.018 --> 00:13:15.261]  I have been contacted by the USTACOM about government-issued weapons and equipment on loan to VFW Post statewide.
[00:13:16.081 --> 00:13:23.151]  The essence of our conversations centered on inventory of all government's weapons and equipment by each VFW post.
[00:13:23.592 --> 00:13:30.282]  While you may have had possession of this equipment for 20, 40, 60 or even 100 years, it still belongs to the U.S.
[00:13:30.302 --> 00:13:30.742]  military.
[00:13:31.693 --> 00:13:37.296]  In short, every VFW post will be needed to complete the attached form and send to the department.
[00:13:37.656 --> 00:13:47.861]  This form will then be bounced off the central database of all Texas VFW posts at US Army TACOM to verify serial numbers of each item that has been issued.
[00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:52.783]  This is a very extensive list and goes back to before the VFW was founded.
[00:13:53.043 --> 00:13:55.964]  So if you have a cannon from the Spanish-American War, it's on the list.
[00:13:56.525 --> 00:13:57.385]  Weapons and equipment.
[00:14:02.707 --> 00:14:14.813]  Consists of, but is not limited to, rifles, pistols, mortars, artilleries, tanks, vehicles, aircraft, missiles, aircraft carriers, etc.
[00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:16.714]  from any time period.
[00:14:17.234 --> 00:14:26.579]  I know there are posts that have weapons they inherited from another post when they combined or when some other post closed or donated to another post when the post could not
[00:14:27.645 --> 00:14:29.045]  And no longer maintain the items.
[00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:37.448]  Please do not try to hide this as all weapons and equipment not accounted for will be reported to the FBI and BATF as stolen military equipment.
[00:14:37.888 --> 00:14:41.770]  The items will just be properly transferred to your district post.
[00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:49.192]  One of their favorite things BATF does at gun shows, if somebody sells a body armor or a helmet, something that's even theirs, they just arrest you.
[00:14:49.672 --> 00:14:50.692]  They just hate America.
[00:14:51.413 --> 00:14:55.414]  You see, the United States previously reveled
[00:14:56.824 --> 00:15:12.333]  reveled in the fact that in Europe, read Thomas Jefferson, all the founders, in Europe the people didn't have, weren't even allowed to own swords, weren't allowed to own muskets, much less tanks and, and, and, and, and, and cannon.
[00:15:13.153 --> 00:15:15.435]  Tanks weren't invented until World War I, but you get my point.
[00:15:15.775 --> 00:15:16.795]  Now we have all this.
[00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:21.398]  It's pure Americana, pure liberty, liberta, that
[00:15:23.194 --> 00:15:29.839]  That these weapons were served out when they were, quote, obsolete to the local militias that then the VFW grew out of.
[00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:37.065]  Homeland Security lists you as the number one terrorist.
[00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:48.494]  In fact, when I finish reading this document, we show in the inventory form, a search engine for folks out there in case they just now tuned in and are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv or never heard the show before, listening on the radio.
[00:15:51.164 --> 00:15:56.928]  Google for folks, veterans listed as number one terror threat by Homeland Security.
[00:15:57.088 --> 00:16:00.410]  We'll show you the document, because I know a lot of you are new and you're going to say it isn't real.
[00:16:00.811 --> 00:16:02.832]  Doesn't matter if it was in hundreds of newspapers and we broke it.
[00:16:03.613 --> 00:16:03.973]  Okay.
[00:16:07.395 --> 00:16:12.319]  I am hopeful that I will not need to remind anyone of the severity of punishment that can be administered
[00:16:13.044 --> 00:16:21.770]  Or the legal bills resulting from individuals or elected officers, if on post property, of the post having possession of stolen military weapons, which the government gave them.
[00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:26.794]  We have until January 31st, 2009 to report to US Army TACOM.
[00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:30.316]  July.
[00:16:30.597 --> 00:16:34.659]  We have until July 31st, 2009 to report to US Army TACOM.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.704]  Please submit your inventory list as soon as possible so I can mark your post district off our list.
[00:16:41.843 --> 00:16:46.685]  And see, this is about the bureaucracy of a list of veterans and veterans reporting on themselves.
[00:16:47.045 --> 00:16:50.386]  Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.
[00:16:50.627 --> 00:16:52.087]  Thanks for your help on this matter.
[00:16:52.747 --> 00:16:59.030]  Dan West, Sergeant, USMC Retired, Assistant Adjunct, Department of Texas Veterans and Foreign Affairs.
[00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.171]  This is the New World Order.
[00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:02.691]  Show them the inventory list.
[00:17:03.092 --> 00:17:04.072]  Click on the other document.
[00:17:05.902 --> 00:17:07.903]  Here's the inventory list for everybody out there.
[00:17:07.923 --> 00:17:14.047]  So you can list that 100-year-old, 150-year-old cannon that's spiked out front.
[00:17:14.988 --> 00:17:19.711]  And don't worry, the state of Texas is listing its cannons out front from the Texas Independents.
[00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:25.514]  Those things are like crosses to vampires.
[00:17:25.554 --> 00:17:27.195]  They hate our liberty teeth so much.
[00:17:28.616 --> 00:17:29.697]  Here you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:31.644 --> 00:17:34.585]  So they give it to you, they push it, just like they tell the troops.
[00:17:35.165 --> 00:17:36.526]  Remember the $60-plus billion?
[00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:40.327]  It was $20 billion, then $40 billion, then $60-plus billion, in pallets of $100 bills?
[00:17:40.868 --> 00:17:43.609]  And they would give every private $10, $20, $30 grand a year.
[00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:47.270]  They'd give colonels millions, generals untold millions, stolen loot.
[00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.511]  But later they'd say, now you're part of the corruption.
[00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:54.393]  If you report on any of this, it was being done by the White House, you're going to be in trouble.
[00:17:56.073 --> 00:17:57.834]  Well, this is how they're going to corrupt the VFW.
[00:17:58.074 --> 00:17:59.755]  Oh, you don't know where that rifle came from.
[00:18:00.936 --> 00:18:04.979]  Just agreed to report on other members of the VFW that don't like the President.
[00:18:06.941 --> 00:18:09.864]  I mean, they admit in the Department of Homeland Security documents that go out nationwide.
[00:18:10.044 --> 00:18:11.545]  They're spying on veterans, gun owners.
[00:18:11.565 --> 00:18:13.487]  We're the number one threat to their criminal activity.
[00:18:14.968 --> 00:18:16.249]  Let's go ahead and go to calls.
[00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:24.176]  I said I want to hear from people at VFW who've gotten this or who are veterans or VFW members.
[00:18:24.496 --> 00:18:25.917]  Roger in Missouri are on the air.
[00:18:25.957 --> 00:18:26.278]  Go ahead.
[00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:34.426]  Yeah, thanks for reporting on this.
[00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:37.150]  I do have to correct you on one thing.
[00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:46.862]  I was instrumental in getting the Marine Corps League started about seven years ago, and we do military funerals, and we did apply and got
[00:18:47.763 --> 00:19:15.158]  uh... in one grand raffles from uh... u s government and they have they were very specific about it and you're not listening to me asserts hold on you didn't hear a word i said not a word i said i said this has been in the last fifteen twenty years they do this they the the the government gifted those civil war cannons to answer that you like i'm gonna tell you something this is new i know that so you're not correcting me go ahead
[00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:21.045]  Well, all I wanted to say was, when they sent us the weapons, they did say they were loaned.
[00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:22.566]  They didn't say that they were given.
[00:19:22.606 --> 00:19:23.146]  No, I know!
[00:19:23.206 --> 00:19:24.867]  I'm saying now they're telling you that.
[00:19:25.268 --> 00:19:25.768]  I understand.
[00:19:25.828 --> 00:19:26.148]  Okay.
[00:19:26.508 --> 00:19:26.769]  Alright.
[00:19:27.189 --> 00:19:37.356]  But, I'm also a lifetime member of VFW in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, home of Popper Rush Limbaugh.
[00:19:38.057 --> 00:19:41.219]  I have just made an urgent call to my commander.
[00:19:41.696 --> 00:19:42.516]  Stay there, stay there, sir.
[00:19:42.536 --> 00:19:43.637]  And I wasn't trying to be rude to you.
[00:19:43.677 --> 00:19:44.777]  I just want to be specific.
[00:19:45.257 --> 00:19:46.518]  I know they do this now.
[00:19:46.558 --> 00:19:48.498]  I'm saying that's the contract trick.
[00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:53.160]  And they have you sign contracts to then domesticate you and basically turn you into informants.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.921]  You're just being punked.
[00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:57.762]  You're being made into servants of the feds and InfraGard.
[00:19:58.002 --> 00:19:58.482]  Stay there, sir.
[00:19:58.502 --> 00:19:59.422]  I want to talk to you, Roger.
[00:19:59.462 --> 00:20:00.043]  Thanks for calling.
[00:20:00.063 --> 00:20:00.423]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.683 --> 00:20:06.905]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:20:07.697 --> 00:20:13.058]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:20:13.578 --> 00:20:19.780]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.900]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.441]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:20:24.521 --> 00:20:35.403]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:38.969]  It's not about left or right.
[00:20:39.369 --> 00:20:40.770]  It's about a one world government.
[00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:47.554]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:21:02.228 --> 00:21:04.209]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[00:22:00.455 --> 00:22:02.636]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[00:22:02.796 --> 00:22:11.920]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:20.143]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[00:22:20.323 --> 00:22:26.266]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[00:22:27.126 --> 00:22:27.686]  We're good to go.
[00:22:56.079 --> 00:22:56.919]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.740]  Call today.
[00:23:01.101 --> 00:23:04.582]  Going into battle, you would want all the ammunition for your gun you could get.
[00:23:04.782 --> 00:23:08.003]  But presently, ammunition and reloading supplies are in shortage.
[00:23:08.323 --> 00:23:09.203]  Now think about this.
[00:23:09.663 --> 00:23:15.525]  If you have no food, all the guns and ammunition will be useless against the population control breadlines.
[00:23:15.865 --> 00:23:18.746]  In the present battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[00:23:21.493 --> 00:23:22.073]  We're good to go.
[00:23:54.897 --> 00:24:04.661]  Ron Paul is coming up in the next segment now.
[00:24:04.681 --> 00:24:07.121]  He's not going to be able to go on the floor, so stay with us for that.
[00:24:08.762 --> 00:24:13.504]  And I'm going to continue with Roger and Matt and Mark and everybody else who's holding.
[00:24:14.084 --> 00:24:15.984]  Roger, I wouldn't jump in on you when you called in to correct me.
[00:24:16.004 --> 00:24:20.246]  The reason I jumped on you is I know I predicted last hour how this was going to go.
[00:24:21.348 --> 00:24:26.490]  And it's going to be, well you guys, hold on just a second, you guys signed all the documents, so now you're basically our slaves.
[00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:38.894]  But the point is, they're lying about all this previous stuff, and I've got to get the actual year, but I talked to a VFW head who won't come on air, and he said, yeah, they started having to sign forms the last 15, 20 years, he's got to pull some documents up.
[00:24:39.074 --> 00:24:41.175]  But the issue, and I'm going to let you talk, and I appreciate you calling,
[00:24:41.875 --> 00:24:51.302]  Is that they, out of the gates, are threatening the veterans who were, who had this stuff pushed on them and given to them to go out and do services for our dead veterans.
[00:24:52.243 --> 00:24:56.687]  And you don't, it's bad enough to be registering them and making them, you know, getting ready to turn the stuff in.
[00:24:57.087 --> 00:25:07.995]  But what's even worse is the fact that out of the gates they're bullying them and threatening them with the law when they do so many great services.
[00:25:08.035 --> 00:25:08.656]  But just go ahead.
[00:25:09.738 --> 00:25:11.099]  You're very correct.
[00:25:11.199 --> 00:25:17.142]  By the way, I'm the one who called in last week and advised you not to get waterboarded, so I know what's going on.
[00:25:17.902 --> 00:25:37.112]  I just made an urgent call to my commander of my VFW and requested to speak at the next VFW meeting, and I would like to challenge all VFW members to do some research, get all this stuff together, and inform their other members.
[00:25:37.672 --> 00:25:38.733]  That's the only way
[00:25:39.583 --> 00:25:41.465]  We're going to get this stopped.
[00:25:41.805 --> 00:25:44.687]  We all know what's going on, especially the people that listen to your program.
[00:25:44.968 --> 00:25:46.229]  Now, you're a former Marine.
[00:25:46.689 --> 00:25:49.531]  You called from Vietnam and then a retired police officer.
[00:25:50.112 --> 00:25:54.795]  You heard me break down how this is treating them like they're criminals out of the gates to get them all scared.
[00:25:55.076 --> 00:26:00.360]  I bet a million dollars next it's going to be, we want to get you to serve us now.
[00:26:01.061 --> 00:26:01.381]  Correct.
[00:26:01.621 --> 00:26:01.901]  Correct.
[00:26:02.021 --> 00:26:02.942]  They've already tried that.
[00:26:03.402 --> 00:26:08.787]  That's why I was an officer in the Marine Corps League and I was on the Honor Guard.
[00:26:09.704 --> 00:26:14.847]  When they sent the National Guard to Iraq, they're the ones that does military funerals in Missouri, and we filled in.
[00:26:14.887 --> 00:26:17.989]  I did 280 funerals in one year.
[00:26:18.609 --> 00:26:21.571]  And you get treated like a piece of filth and threatened by the BATF?
[00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:22.571]  Correct.
[00:26:22.631 --> 00:26:30.816]  And then I got ostracized from my Marine Corps League and the BFW for speaking out three and four years ago about the same things that you talk about every day.
[00:26:31.296 --> 00:26:32.957]  But I bet they're not laughing at you now.
[00:26:33.718 --> 00:26:34.258]  No, they're not.
[00:26:34.418 --> 00:26:39.101]  And I'm getting ready to jump in big, and I'm going to get some things done.
[00:26:39.614 --> 00:26:49.993]  Might not help, but at least I'm going to try to get the fellow veterans, the ones, especially the VFW members, the ones who risked their lives, to stand up one more time.
[00:26:51.684 --> 00:26:59.167]  Well, it's a shame that we would be suckered, the American people, into wars that were questionable, and then when tyranny is here, this is the time!
[00:26:59.627 --> 00:27:04.189]  I mean, if people ever wanted a chance to fight for America by speaking out, at least, this is it!
[00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:05.789]  I mean, this is the real deal!
[00:27:06.069 --> 00:27:07.350]  This is D-Day!
[00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.650]  This is Red Dawn!
[00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.371]  This is happening, my friend!
[00:27:10.391 --> 00:27:21.015]  A former Marine friend of mine, three years ago, had come home from Vietnam, never had a mental problem, worked at one place all his life, and he finally had a nervous breakdown.
[00:27:21.801 --> 00:27:22.681]  I think so.
[00:27:40.342 --> 00:27:43.683]  And by the way, there's no law to do that.
[00:27:43.743 --> 00:27:46.224]  It's felonies under the 1968 Gun Control Act.
[00:27:46.484 --> 00:27:49.365]  But they're now giving people a fake jurisdiction.
[00:27:49.405 --> 00:27:51.745]  It's like they force shots on you and there's no law.
[00:27:51.985 --> 00:28:00.548]  They take your kids without a proper court order and they come and take vets' guns every day, I see it in the news, when there's not a law for a psychological made-up issue.
[00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:03.318]  Oh, God.
[00:28:03.618 --> 00:28:05.039]  Well, I mean, look, it's coming to a head.
[00:28:05.139 --> 00:28:13.842]  They have decided to turn all the young cops and military and the gang members and the illegal aliens they're hiring for the military loose against the veterans.
[00:28:14.403 --> 00:28:20.085]  And they plan to have both sides kill each other and then bring in the I-4 after everything breaks down.
[00:28:20.585 --> 00:28:26.107]  And I'm telling you, folks, they're planning reconstruction-style occupation in the United States.
[00:28:27.028 --> 00:28:27.608]  Yes, they are.
[00:28:28.686 --> 00:28:35.027]  What they don't understand is it's going to be really bloody and there might not be anything left if they do that.
[00:28:35.767 --> 00:28:37.128]  Well, I mean, it's not talk though.
[00:28:37.208 --> 00:28:38.728]  Americans are always like this.
[00:28:39.208 --> 00:28:42.809]  We put up and put up, but when the sleeping giant gets up... That's right.
[00:28:43.189 --> 00:28:50.790]  I mean, it's... I'll tell you, I'm not looking forward... Some captured SS officers was questioned in World War II.
[00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:56.272]  By the way, my family goes all the way back to the Civil War serving this country.
[00:28:56.772 --> 00:28:58.452]  So, we are all patriots.
[00:28:58.837 --> 00:29:06.726]  But they asked us SS officers what they were afraid of most in the United States military and they said a mad American.
[00:29:08.788 --> 00:29:16.296]  They said if we had a big battle and we annihilated a unit, we didn't want to fight the next ones coming up because they was mad and they was ruthless.
[00:29:17.377 --> 00:29:20.981]  So the powers that be, and I'm sure they're listening to this show, they better take heed.
[00:29:22.523 --> 00:29:23.864]  We have to know who the enemy is.
[00:29:23.924 --> 00:29:24.604]  It's Bernanke.
[00:29:24.645 --> 00:29:25.445]  It's the Rothschilds.
[00:29:25.505 --> 00:29:26.446]  It's the Rockefellers.
[00:29:26.886 --> 00:29:27.527]  It's Geithner.
[00:29:27.787 --> 00:29:30.329]  When we get this country back, they're all going to get a fair trial.
[00:29:31.089 --> 00:29:32.490]  And folks, I'm risking my life doing this.
[00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.511]  They're watching me right now.
[00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:35.352]  We're going to take them on.
[00:29:35.392 --> 00:29:37.854]  And a lot of us are going to have to give our lives in this fight.
[00:29:38.374 --> 00:29:40.316]  But in the end, we are going to kick their butt.
[00:29:40.376 --> 00:29:41.136]  God bless you, sir.
[00:29:41.156 --> 00:29:41.777]  Good to hear from you.
[00:29:42.117 --> 00:29:43.098]  More vets coming up.
[00:29:43.118 --> 00:29:46.420]  Got to basically register their guns and turn them in to the feds.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.001]  That's the new freedom.
[00:29:48.661 --> 00:29:49.142]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.246 --> 00:29:52.128]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.213]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.233 --> 00:29:57.862]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.782 --> 00:30:05.767]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:30:05.987 --> 00:30:09.791]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:10.011 --> 00:30:15.617]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.917 --> 00:30:20.782]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:21.002 --> 00:30:25.026]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.246 --> 00:30:27.328]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:30:27.348 --> 00:30:30.551]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[00:30:43.624 --> 00:30:44.946]  A long time sponsor of ours.
[00:30:45.186 --> 00:30:49.753]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:49.893 --> 00:30:51.435]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:00.748 --> 00:31:02.330]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:07.015]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:31:07.195 --> 00:31:09.938]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:31:10.158 --> 00:31:13.021]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:31:13.201 --> 00:31:17.926]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:31:18.146 --> 00:31:19.067]  If you simply prepare.
[00:31:19.267 --> 00:31:22.210]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:29.396]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:31:29.496 --> 00:31:32.639]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:31:32.779 --> 00:31:34.661]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[00:31:37.924 --> 00:31:43.970]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:31:44.191 --> 00:31:47.935]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:47.955 --> 00:31:49.296]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:49.316 --> 00:31:49.897]  Take action today.
[00:31:49.937 --> 00:31:51.919]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:32:00.762 --> 00:32:06.365]  Surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:07.465]  Take a deep breath.
[00:32:08.386 --> 00:32:14.689]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:15.970]  Have a glass of water.
[00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:21.032]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other
[00:32:25.745 --> 00:32:26.245]  I think so.
[00:32:44.455 --> 00:32:45.136]  Ron Paul's coming up!
[00:33:14.383 --> 00:33:15.664]  Calling us from the floor of the house.
[00:33:19.006 --> 00:33:20.366]  Your calls as well.
[00:33:20.467 --> 00:33:22.848]  Government demands inventory of all VFW weapons.
[00:33:22.968 --> 00:33:35.575]  Threatens, that should be the headline, threatens veterans with arrest if they don't report hundred-year-old plus cannons that were given to them by the government.
[00:33:36.736 --> 00:33:43.280]  They're trying a lawyer trick now because the last 15-20 years they've been having them sign forms to get the stuff they give to them and push on them.
[00:33:44.394 --> 00:33:48.215]  You know, they ask the veterans, oh, come to all these funerals, you know, for dying vets.
[00:33:49.036 --> 00:33:49.976]  Do these ceremonies.
[00:33:50.996 --> 00:33:55.058]  And, uh, here, you know, we'll give you the M1s to shoot the blanks, and we'll give you the uniforms and things.
[00:33:55.098 --> 00:33:58.579]  And now they're saying, we're gonna send the BATF after you if you don't, um...
[00:34:00.131 --> 00:34:01.071]  Keep a record of all that.
[00:34:01.091 --> 00:34:09.194]  And they've also announced, until Congress got upset, Obama said, no more brass left over from the military for reloading to be sold to big companies.
[00:34:10.094 --> 00:34:13.875]  And they introduced all these bills to totally end the Second Amendment as we know it.
[00:34:14.656 --> 00:34:16.316]  This is all happening.
[00:34:16.756 --> 00:34:17.977]  This is all real.
[00:34:18.017 --> 00:34:20.177]  And it's just going to incrementally continue.
[00:34:20.798 --> 00:34:24.999]  But even though it's incremental, the incrementalism is accelerating now.
[00:34:26.491 --> 00:34:28.892]  It is intensifying now.
[00:34:29.932 --> 00:34:33.854]  It is expanding now.
[00:34:35.694 --> 00:34:40.296]  And the question is, as a society, what are we going to do about this?
[00:34:40.356 --> 00:34:44.978]  We have private outside banks that are having their way with the people.
[00:34:45.976 --> 00:34:52.387]  As soon as Ron Paul gets on with us, that's what we're going to discuss, is the bill that he's introduced.
[00:34:52.487 --> 00:34:54.471]  It's now got over 200 sponsors.
[00:34:54.972 --> 00:34:56.534]  Bill to Audit Federal Reserve now has 207 co-sponsors.
[00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:02.954]  New names being added every day, momentum building for Ron Paul and the American people.
[00:35:03.554 --> 00:35:09.839]  Identifying the outside criminal organization, the private bankers that have engineered the collapse, that have taken over our society.
[00:35:09.899 --> 00:35:10.940]  This is the new world order.
[00:35:11.361 --> 00:35:14.243]  We have their minutes, we have their documents, we have it all.
[00:35:14.283 --> 00:35:22.810]  We understand what they're doing, and what they're setting up, and what they are creating.
[00:35:26.348 --> 00:35:29.412]  Bill to Audit Federal Reserve now has 207 co-sponsors.
[00:35:29.873 --> 00:35:30.954]  New names being added every day.
[00:35:31.014 --> 00:35:32.837]  Momentum building for the American people.
[00:35:33.257 --> 00:35:36.722]  Thanks to Ron Paul and all of your phone calls to Congress, all the letters to Congress.
[00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:48.939]  At a time of writing, a bill that would see the Federal Reserve Bank audited for the first time in 59 years has 207 co-sponsors in the House and is gaining traction with every single day.
[00:35:48.979 --> 00:35:51.361]  Now we've seen numbers of 200 is what we confirm.
[00:35:51.802 --> 00:35:53.043]  Daily Pulse saying 207.
[00:35:53.783 --> 00:36:00.889]  We can talk to the man himself, Congressman Ron Paul, the hardest working man in Congress, Dr. Ron Paul, hailing from Texas.
[00:36:00.949 --> 00:36:02.350]  I'm so honored to be a Texan with him.
[00:36:03.011 --> 00:36:05.073]  Congressman, how many sponsors does it really have?
[00:36:05.816 --> 00:36:08.638]  Well, it's actually 209 right now.
[00:36:08.979 --> 00:36:10.380]  Yeah, you heard it here first!
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:10.380]  209!
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:15.785]  So we have to almost check minute by minute, and they're coming in faster and easier now.
[00:36:15.905 --> 00:36:23.131]  And the percentage of the new people are Democrats, because a lot of the Republicans are already on.
[00:36:23.191 --> 00:36:24.412]  So it is spreading.
[00:36:24.492 --> 00:36:27.495]  I think the people at the grassroots have done the job that they need to do.
[00:36:28.375 --> 00:36:38.988]  And when we feel really depressed about how slow Congress works, we do have a system that will respond if we wake up enough people, but that's the tough job.
[00:36:39.008 --> 00:36:41.370]  But they will respond when they hear from the people.
[00:36:42.051 --> 00:36:46.116]  Congressman, how long have you worked to get this many sponsors?
[00:36:46.136 --> 00:36:48.659]  I mean, you've been introducing this bill for a decade, haven't you?
[00:36:49.522 --> 00:36:52.363]  Yes, it's been probably ever since I've been in Congress.
[00:36:52.383 --> 00:36:58.285]  I don't know if I've ever skipped any, but there's never been any general support from the public.
[00:36:58.345 --> 00:37:04.547]  But because of the financial crisis, because of the presidential campaign, and the interest in the Federal Reserve, all of a sudden it's come together.
[00:37:05.423 --> 00:37:15.009]  So this is by far the most interest that we've had, and quite frankly I think it's the most interest anybody's ever had since the Federal Reserve has been established in 1913.
[00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:27.297]  But you know, even though the Fed contributed significantly if they didn't cause the whole depression of the 30s, nobody was calling for, you know, auditing the Fed and abolishing the Fed today.
[00:37:27.577 --> 00:37:29.739]  Those are routine chants that we hear.
[00:37:30.659 --> 00:37:37.161]  And therefore, I think we're making great progress only because they've created such a chaotic mess that we're dealing with.
[00:37:37.701 --> 00:37:44.063]  Well, we'll have to change the headline at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to 209 from Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:37:44.083 --> 00:37:45.824]  So you heard it here first, sir.
[00:37:46.304 --> 00:37:51.085]  I don't want listeners to blink or viewers to blink because they may miss history.
[00:37:52.025 --> 00:37:57.207]  I don't think even our own movement realizes the gravity of the fact that it looks like
[00:37:58.092 --> 00:38:02.378]  This bill has a good chance of passing if we get another ten or so sponsors.
[00:38:02.418 --> 00:38:04.942]  And the Federal Reserve has hired lobbyists to try to block this.
[00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:10.549]  Their arrogance, their veneer of invincibility, their cloak of invincibility is falling away.
[00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.352]  People see that they can be beat.
[00:38:12.632 --> 00:38:14.395]  They see that they are not above the law.
[00:38:14.895 --> 00:38:24.301]  It's viral videos with the former Fed Chairman and current Fed Chairman saying they're above the law and no one can look into them and no agency of government of the three branches can.
[00:38:24.561 --> 00:38:30.685]  That is asinine on its face for even an uneducated, uninformed public on our system of government.
[00:38:31.166 --> 00:38:32.967]  And so I just want to get your take on
[00:38:34.562 --> 00:38:39.247]  What is it like for you to know you're the leader of something that is so amazingly historical?
[00:38:39.287 --> 00:38:45.734]  Because even if they somehow beat this this time, then the question is, how were we not able to audit you?
[00:38:46.114 --> 00:38:51.820]  And so you can see that the momentum has changed and the pendulum is really shifting.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.743]  I sense destiny of the level of 1776 here, sir.
[00:38:56.952 --> 00:38:58.173]  I think there's no doubt about it.
[00:38:58.213 --> 00:39:06.979]  They can't put the genie back in the bottle because the odds are still, you know, iffy about where this is going to go.
[00:39:06.999 --> 00:39:12.643]  I mean, the powers that be have a lot of tools that they can use.
[00:39:12.763 --> 00:39:15.485]  Conference committees, they might block it in the Senate.
[00:39:16.626 --> 00:39:18.469]  They can do all sorts of things.
[00:39:19.631 --> 00:39:24.178]  So I remain cautiously optimistic because I know it has a long way to go.
[00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:27.283]  But the issue will not be quieted down.
[00:39:27.323 --> 00:39:28.825]  I mean, the issue is out there.
[00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:40.531]  You know, in some ways, let's say we have all this attention and this bill and we get the majority in the Congress to endorse it and it never gets out and never goes anywhere.
[00:39:40.971 --> 00:39:44.633]  It's proof positive that we really need to do it.
[00:39:44.773 --> 00:39:49.194]  That means the incentive will be that much greater to get a handle on all this.
[00:39:49.254 --> 00:39:54.316]  So, I think we win either way because we've gotten the attention of such a large number of people.
[00:39:54.916 --> 00:40:07.325]  It's not only the very, very hardcore Constitutionalists, because the grassroots are talking to the very average Republican, the very average Democrat, the moderate, the liberal, the progressive, and they're all joining it.
[00:40:07.645 --> 00:40:11.428]  But the issue really here is reigning in government and transparency.
[00:40:12.389 --> 00:40:19.794]  We should not be fooled into believing that they have a strong belief in the monetary policies that we might want.
[00:40:19.874 --> 00:40:22.716]  I mean, they're not old gold standard people or anything else.
[00:40:22.756 --> 00:40:23.537]  What's driving this
[00:40:24.137 --> 00:40:39.723]  Is that Congress has created a mess, the Federal Reserve has been doing a lot secretly, and the American people want to know what's happening because they've seen too many special interests bailed out, not only by Congress and the Treasury but by the Federal Reserve as well, and they're demanding answers.
[00:40:41.178 --> 00:40:46.064]  Congressman, in the 12 minutes or so we have left with you, I've got so many important questions concerning this.
[00:40:46.824 --> 00:40:52.971]  How do we explain to some of the public out there that this is all a process of liberty?
[00:40:53.372 --> 00:40:59.459]  Tyranny wasn't born overnight in this country, and liberty isn't going to take back over overnight.
[00:40:59.499 --> 00:41:01.080]  It's a constant battle between those two.
[00:41:02.389 --> 00:41:06.530]  Title forces, as you know, but people said, oh, Ron Paul didn't win, so boo-hoo.
[00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.811]  I said, no, it built this giant movement.
[00:41:08.851 --> 00:41:15.633]  Now the biggest thing on campus isn't liberal or fake conservative, it's libertarian, it's freedom, it's constitutionalist.
[00:41:16.293 --> 00:41:20.455]  And now people are finally seeing that a year later, that it's building in strength
[00:41:22.296 --> 00:41:30.460]  And that it's a process that even, as you just said, even if they defeat it this time, then people say, well, why can't we audit it?
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:40.404]  It's almost better if they do engage in chicanery and pull out the stops and beat it this time, because then everybody's going to want to know what they're hiding.
[00:41:40.624 --> 00:41:47.868]  Yep, that's exactly right, and that'll just energize our group of young people especially, even more so.
[00:41:48.502 --> 00:41:53.443]  But I think it's an issue whose time has come, and it's not going to go away.
[00:41:54.643 --> 00:42:10.407]  And I don't know if you saw Jim Grant's quote today on the business station, but he said that if we ever got that auditing bill passed, that it would be a declaration that the Federal Reserve is in a lot worse shape than any of the banks that went bankrupt.
[00:42:11.387 --> 00:42:16.172]  Technically, you know, in conventional terms, the Federal Reserve does not have the assets.
[00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:20.137]  All they have are credits, and obviously that's what we would expect.
[00:42:20.597 --> 00:42:26.744]  But that goes to prove why they can't be the salvation of this country.
[00:42:26.824 --> 00:42:33.671]  I mean, just counterfeiting money and doing mischief and serving the interests of their friends, that can't work.
[00:42:34.031 --> 00:42:40.017]  I think it's going to come to an end whether we win this legislative victory or not, because their system is deeply flawed.
[00:42:40.217 --> 00:42:49.125]  Ultimately, I think the solution comes if we're well prepared to offer it up when the system totally collapses.
[00:42:49.145 --> 00:42:51.908]  The financial structure has come unglued.
[00:42:53.021 --> 00:42:56.882]  But the dollar still works to a degree.
[00:42:57.103 --> 00:42:59.904]  People still are buying dollars and they don't know what to do with them.
[00:43:00.384 --> 00:43:07.426]  But when they get discouraged and they don't hold dollars anymore, and then they start buying up hard assets, they're starting to buy oil now more than they did a month or so ago.
[00:43:07.446 --> 00:43:09.367]  And they continue to buy gold.
[00:43:10.167 --> 00:43:12.129]  You know, China continues to buy gold.
[00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:13.811]  I mean, there's a lot of things.
[00:43:14.252 --> 00:43:19.897]  But the end stages of a situation like this goes very, very rapidly once the sentiment changes.
[00:43:20.378 --> 00:43:27.926]  Just like when the financial system collapsed, everybody rushed to dollars and interest rates went down to 1%, along with what the Fed was doing.
[00:43:28.426 --> 00:43:34.910]  But when a currency crisis hit, people went, holy man, let's get out of the dollar.
[00:43:35.291 --> 00:43:36.551]  And then you'll see the fireworks.
[00:43:36.751 --> 00:43:40.274]  Then we have to be prepared to say, don't just give us a U.N.
[00:43:40.354 --> 00:43:40.974]  central bank.
[00:43:40.994 --> 00:43:47.338]  I mean, the international planners are, they know what we know, and they're making their plans.
[00:43:47.378 --> 00:43:48.799]  They know their days are numbered.
[00:43:49.219 --> 00:43:53.202]  But the contest is between totalitarianism and liberty and
[00:43:53.895 --> 00:44:01.779]  And whoever wants the totalitarian approach has to have government-monopolized money, and that's what we have to stop.
[00:44:02.379 --> 00:44:08.482]  In your gut, and we all know what the gut is, it's thousands of pieces of data integrated in and the mind comes up with a prime projection.
[00:44:08.863 --> 00:44:23.070]  In your gut, Congressman, do you agree with me that in the last two months we were about to get the title shift or the flip to our side, but I can almost spiritually feel it at a DNA level that the shift has happened?
[00:44:23.712 --> 00:44:24.352]  Toward our way?
[00:44:24.752 --> 00:44:24.972]  Yes.
[00:44:25.393 --> 00:44:28.273]  Well, when I'm out of Washington, I have two perspectives.
[00:44:28.314 --> 00:44:38.137]  You know, when I go to a college campus, and you represent and talk to people outside of Washington, and there should be reason why you're seeing signs of optimism.
[00:44:38.657 --> 00:44:40.037]  I come up here every single day.
[00:44:40.137 --> 00:44:46.059]  Right now, we're dealing with the State Department authorization bill, and it's atrocious.
[00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:50.721]  You know, it's $18 billion and more mischief and more militarism.
[00:44:51.501 --> 00:44:56.104]  And the Republicans this time are going to oppose it, but it's just a partisan thing.
[00:44:56.144 --> 00:44:57.845]  But it'll go sailing right through.
[00:44:57.865 --> 00:45:03.569]  So you're saying there's two different worlds, and more and more it's getting separated and that gulf is widening.
[00:45:03.976 --> 00:45:12.301]  Right, and like this week, and I just got off the floor, I gave my all of two minutes, and I said, you know, our president has asked us to go with PAYGO.
[00:45:12.441 --> 00:45:13.822]  Pay the bills as you go along.
[00:45:13.842 --> 00:45:16.503]  Of course, for the liberal, that means raise taxes.
[00:45:16.563 --> 00:45:17.964]  Well, how can they raise taxes?
[00:45:18.304 --> 00:45:22.047]  There's no businesses out there that can pay.
[00:45:22.527 --> 00:45:25.969]  But they're not going to pay for this if they're incapable.
[00:45:27.208 --> 00:45:27.749]  We're good to go.
[00:45:46.732 --> 00:45:49.835]  In two years from now, we're in a, you know, cut way back.
[00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:52.116]  We'll deal with the problems later on.
[00:45:52.136 --> 00:45:57.880]  And, you know, I think though our crowd is probably like young people around the world.
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:06.767]  Think of those young people in China when Geithner goes over there and says, oh yeah, we're going to get things under control and we're going to rein back our spending.
[00:46:07.047 --> 00:46:08.608]  And those students just laughed at them.
[00:46:08.968 --> 00:46:24.085]  Well, I imagine there's a lot of students around the country and a lot of other people now who just laugh at us up here in Washington, but the people here in Washington are still in charge and we haven't converted them and we're just seeing
[00:46:24.545 --> 00:46:25.305]  Well, I don't know.
[00:46:46.511 --> 00:46:48.213]  Absolutely, things are certainly deepening.
[00:46:48.233 --> 00:46:54.258]  When do you see the next big plunge downward, deeper into this globally engineered depression?
[00:46:56.801 --> 00:47:04.148]  I think it's really going down now, but the government statistics are giving people a false sense of security, so I think we're still slipping.
[00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:14.598]  But there will be more announcements and more bankruptcies and probably more commercial property problems and more states going bankrupt and more unemployment.
[00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:23.725]  Then finally, the euphoria on Wall Street over the last four months, it'll dissipate and that'll feed into a lot of disappointments.
[00:47:23.745 --> 00:47:28.989]  But you know, even though Wall Street has done a little bit better by these prices going up a little bit,
[00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:34.253]  I don't think the average guy out there that's lost his job has started to feel any better yet.
[00:47:36.074 --> 00:47:43.299]  I was impressed the other day that some of the news media have reported that the real rate of unemployment isn't 9%.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:51.407]  It's like 18 percent, you know, when you add up all the people who don't look for jobs anymore or who work a couple hours a week.
[00:47:51.487 --> 00:47:53.950]  So it's a very serious problem.
[00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.910]  Exactly.
[00:47:54.951 --> 00:48:00.636]  The mainstream media is now having to admit more and more that the government is lying and spinning because they want to keep some credibility.
[00:48:01.037 --> 00:48:03.759]  Sir, I want to specifically ask you in the time we have left.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.002]  How do we help you get this bill passed?
[00:48:08.042 --> 00:48:17.729]  How do we help you get HR 1207 that has 209 sponsors now as of June 10, 2009 on this Wednesday edition?
[00:48:18.129 --> 00:48:19.910]  What can we do to get this passed?
[00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:20.691]  What can we do
[00:48:22.051 --> 00:48:35.453]  Because going back to you at McKinney-Ruff's when you gave a speech, after I did, five years ago, it's in my film Matrix of Evil, you talked about how the key was when the global crisis came in, the establishment would try to
[00:48:37.305 --> 00:48:40.607]  Use the crisis to bring in their bank of the world, their world currency.
[00:48:40.747 --> 00:48:42.668]  Because you were reading the same global documents I was.
[00:48:43.528 --> 00:48:49.431]  And then now it's all over the news and they're posing as the saviors and the public is going, wait a minute, you're the guys that did this.
[00:48:49.692 --> 00:48:51.132]  So they are looking to you and others.
[00:48:52.153 --> 00:48:54.214]  So there's this vacuum that's about to happen.
[00:48:54.654 --> 00:48:59.977]  And I mean, just speaking to the fact that, as you always said, when this happened, we had to put in the maximum effort.
[00:49:00.017 --> 00:49:01.838]  So we want to put in the maximum effort.
[00:49:02.078 --> 00:49:02.799]  You're the general.
[00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:04.179]  You're the George Washington, sir.
[00:49:04.539 --> 00:49:05.140]  What do we do?
[00:49:05.808 --> 00:49:09.230]  I think we just do more of what we're doing now and building our numbers.
[00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:13.551]  I mean, you have a large number of people that listen to you, and you continue to do the things that you're best at.
[00:49:14.132 --> 00:49:22.635]  Now, following up from our campaign, we started the Campaign for Liberty, and that website helps bring people together, and our numbers continue to grow.
[00:49:23.176 --> 00:49:32.880]  But right now, in a more specific way, they need to go to Campaign for Liberty, get the names of those who've signed on, and find out exactly the congressmen who have not.
[00:49:33.513 --> 00:49:45.661]  And then instead, if your congressman has already signed on, go to the neighboring congressman and organize and find out where the meetup group is and list these people on the internet.
[00:49:45.801 --> 00:49:46.742]  And go to their office!
[00:49:46.882 --> 00:49:48.583]  I mean, you could go shake their hand, couldn't you?
[00:49:48.783 --> 00:49:49.544]  Yeah, that's it!
[00:49:51.585 --> 00:49:58.088]  When the members come and talk to him and they say, they'll come up and they'll be very nice and they're just trying to do their job.
[00:49:58.128 --> 00:50:02.249]  They say, what is this bill that the grassroots are all riled up about 1200 and something?
[00:50:02.269 --> 00:50:06.371]  And I said, well it has to do with transparency of the feds so we know what they're doing.
[00:50:06.391 --> 00:50:07.531]  Oh, I'm for that!
[00:50:07.551 --> 00:50:08.672]  Then they signed on.
[00:50:08.992 --> 00:50:13.454]  But they came to me not because they wanted to be on a Ron Paul bill.
[00:50:13.994 --> 00:50:15.656]  But because the grassroots were telling him.
[00:50:15.996 --> 00:50:18.799]  Actually, politically, I have to take a little credit.
[00:50:18.879 --> 00:50:22.823]  It is a little more popular being on a Ron Paul bill now than it used to be.
[00:50:22.843 --> 00:50:27.908]  Oh yeah, you're out there setting bushfires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:50:27.948 --> 00:50:28.849]  You've been introducing this.
[00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:33.234]  What, I mean, I remember ten, twelve years ago you'd get like five, six sponsors for this.
[00:50:33.474 --> 00:50:34.275]  It's changing now.
[00:50:34.615 --> 00:50:36.057]  And it's politics, I mean.
[00:50:36.797 --> 00:50:43.119]  Especially marginal Democrats and marginal Republicans when they need this 10 or 15 percent of the vote.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:51.042]  If there's a Democrat in a Republican seat, boy, they really want to pay attention to what's going on.
[00:50:52.342 --> 00:50:56.985]  Congressman, in closing, I want to ask you two quick questions.
[00:50:57.025 --> 00:51:01.388]  Number one, there's a domino effect, isn't there, from what you've been doing?
[00:51:01.628 --> 00:51:16.638]  Because as you move to audit the Fed, other agencies and groups and governments start thinking, here's AP today, Congress subpoenas the Fed about where all the billions of dollars to Bank of America went, because they won't tell Senator Sanders and Congressman Paul and others, yourself.
[00:51:17.399 --> 00:51:20.841]  So again, here's this idea of holding these guys accountable.
[00:51:20.861 --> 00:51:21.902]  It's starting to happen, isn't it?
[00:51:22.222 --> 00:51:26.506]  Oh yeah, it'll be contagious, and that is very good.
[00:51:27.246 --> 00:51:37.735]  I think that fortunately we can get all political groups together on transparency, and then we can argue out what we want to do.
[00:51:37.895 --> 00:51:44.501]  And as a matter of fact, Barney Frank has been helpful to me on this, but he wanted to make sure I knew.
[00:51:45.362 --> 00:51:47.744]  He didn't agree with me on the ultimate monetary policy.
[00:51:48.344 --> 00:51:48.964]  That's okay.
[00:51:49.284 --> 00:51:52.065]  If they believe in transparency, then open debate.
[00:51:52.426 --> 00:51:59.508]  But I just strongly feel that if we get transparency of the Fed and the people know what they've done, I think their days are numbered.
[00:52:00.008 --> 00:52:07.551]  Well, it's been said that an audit of the Fed will abolish the Fed, because as soon as all the admitted criminality, we can see them doing openly.
[00:52:07.571 --> 00:52:12.553]  I mean, what do you expect to find if we do get the audit, or how will they fight that?
[00:52:13.038 --> 00:52:27.172]  I think there'll be some surprises, but I'd be most interested in what they've done with the international organization, which countries they've bailed out, and which central banks they've helped, what they've done with gold, and whether or not they've loaned out and sold gold, and how they manipulate markets.
[00:52:28.073 --> 00:52:31.196]  I would imagine they even manipulate stock markets, for that matter.
[00:52:32.096 --> 00:52:34.678]  Uh, and how they do it would be the thing.
[00:52:35.359 --> 00:52:37.040]  I think it would be a big audit.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:44.565]  You know, I think once they get in there to trace that thing through, it may be a big complex matter because it's international as well.
[00:52:44.966 --> 00:52:48.148]  I see my time is running out and I have to take
[00:52:48.772 --> 00:52:49.652]  Congressman, thank you.
[00:52:49.712 --> 00:52:53.253]  In closing, you'll hear about the news in the next few days.
[00:52:53.313 --> 00:52:57.894]  We broke it, just like the DHS documents, demonizing yourself and others.
[00:52:58.314 --> 00:53:11.097]  The government is demanding an inventory of even hundred-year-old cannons at all VFW posts, and threatening to have BATF raids if the Veterans of Foreign Wars doesn't basically become their little snitches.
[00:53:11.377 --> 00:53:14.657]  So I hope you'll look into this, Congressman, on top of everything else you're doing.
[00:53:14.697 --> 00:53:16.038]  Thank you so much for spending... Okay, very good.
[00:53:16.458 --> 00:53:17.558]  Thank you so much, Congressman.
[00:53:18.218 --> 00:53:18.598]  Take care.
[00:53:18.638 --> 00:53:19.899]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:20.119 --> 00:53:21.300]  On to the next matter.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.061]  A very busy man.
[00:53:22.541 --> 00:53:24.042]  Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:53:24.482 --> 00:53:30.126]  And we skipped that break because he got on with us a little bit late running off of the floor to join us.
[00:53:30.966 --> 00:53:32.067]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:32.307 --> 00:53:36.670]  I know some stations probably went to break then, even though it's not a local station break.
[00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:37.130]  It is a...
[00:53:38.351 --> 00:53:39.793]  It is a network break that we skip.
[00:53:39.813 --> 00:53:50.863]  We only skip network breaks occasionally when we have somebody like Charlie Sheen or Jesse Ventura or Ron Paul or somebody of that, Willie Nelson, on the show and I've got limited time with them.
[00:53:50.943 --> 00:53:59.731]  So there went Congressman Ron Paul and I got that info out to him just like I called their office.
[00:54:00.952 --> 00:54:02.113]  We're going to join some stations now.
[00:54:02.154 --> 00:54:02.374]  Here we go.
[00:54:04.485 --> 00:54:08.650]  Well, I just had Congressman Ron Paul on with us for some stations that may have gone to break.
[00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:10.151]  That was a network break.
[00:54:10.171 --> 00:54:13.074]  Some stations still take breaks they're not supposed to.
[00:54:14.195 --> 00:54:22.424]  But regardless, we just had him on during that last little segment with us as well, talking about a host of issues.
[00:54:22.484 --> 00:54:24.987]  Very, very exciting interview with him.
[00:54:25.968 --> 00:54:34.141]  And when we broke the MIAC report, we broke the DHS report, listeners would call Ron Paul's office saying, hey, you've been listed as a terrorist.
[00:54:35.263 --> 00:54:38.128]  And Ron Paul didn't say this, but his office said that can't be true.
[00:54:38.148 --> 00:54:39.490]  And then later they said, oh my God, it is.
[00:54:40.424 --> 00:54:46.687]  So I wanted to let Ron Paul know personally, I know he's going to hear about this, from me, that it's from us and it's true.
[00:54:47.227 --> 00:54:58.412]  VFW is, BATF is threatening to raid them and confiscate even World War I, Spanish-American War, and also they were given Civil War cannons.
[00:54:58.432 --> 00:55:02.554]  They're saying you have to register all those with us or we're going to SWAT team you with the BATF.
[00:55:03.414 --> 00:55:09.039]  And that is a fact, and we have broken it, and I have confirmed it, and it is absolutely massive news.
[00:55:09.619 --> 00:55:13.142]  Okay, I have just done an interview with Ron Paul.
[00:55:13.422 --> 00:55:17.666]  I want to get back to your calls on this VFW situation, get into the economy and a host of other
[00:55:18.934 --> 00:55:25.919]  Issues, but I also want listeners to know that the money bomb is coming up tomorrow and we're getting a huge response already.
[00:55:25.939 --> 00:55:27.000]  People are really excited.
[00:55:27.781 --> 00:55:30.263]  Thousands of people have signed up and pledged to give.
[00:55:30.543 --> 00:55:31.864]  This is your chance to be part of history.
[00:55:31.924 --> 00:55:32.905]  Think of everything we're doing.
[00:55:32.925 --> 00:55:34.065]  Think of everything we're going through.
[00:55:34.326 --> 00:55:35.727]  Think of everything we're trying to build here.
[00:55:36.906 --> 00:55:41.188]  You know, I make these high-quality, expensive films, and then I release them for free on Google and YouTube.
[00:55:41.388 --> 00:55:46.710]  Now, they're in higher quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, and PrisonPlanet.tv members and their memberships make that possible.
[00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:52.512]  And they also get the live TV show and all the other films and books and things, being PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:55:52.552 --> 00:56:04.477]  But we need to raise more capital to hire a couple more video editors, another webmaster or two, some more personnel, some people to moderate the comments so the death threats aren't on there, so the FBI doesn't come subpoena me.
[00:56:05.297 --> 00:56:08.059]  As Wired Magazine's reporting on yesterday, and AP as well.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.882]  So, we need funds here.
[00:56:10.922 --> 00:56:11.402]  I mean, think.
[00:56:11.582 --> 00:56:12.803]  This is a little operation.
[00:56:13.224 --> 00:56:21.090]  There are about 14 people in this office, and the Watson brothers, and Kurt Nemo in New Mexico, and a few other people.
[00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:23.492]  A few contract IT guys.
[00:56:23.892 --> 00:56:24.653]  I mean, that's it.
[00:56:26.855 --> 00:56:29.657]  And I need more personnel to go to the next level.
[00:56:31.889 --> 00:56:34.793]  There's nothing bang for the buck like this radio show.
[00:56:35.434 --> 00:56:38.318]  When you buy books, buy videos, support our sponsors, that funds us.
[00:56:38.558 --> 00:56:47.951]  When you donate on the 2nd Annual 2009 Money Bomb at Infowarsmoneybomb.com tomorrow, starting in the morning, it's going to start up and run until Friday when the show starts.
[00:56:50.114 --> 00:56:52.035]  You know, we've got on there the $20,000 have come in.
[00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:52.516]  It's more like $60,000.
[00:56:54.097 --> 00:56:58.120]  We have to manually enter the money, but about $60,000 has come in so far.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:59.140]  I want to go well above $250,000.
[00:56:59.601 --> 00:57:01.722]  Sounds like a lot.
[00:57:01.802 --> 00:57:05.385]  It's not when you're trying to do TV and finish our TV studio.
[00:57:05.945 --> 00:57:07.907]  Look at all we've done in a year.
[00:57:08.127 --> 00:57:10.989]  Found the office, moved in, built the studio.
[00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:12.390]  It was a gutted warehouse in here.
[00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:16.213]  Had to haggle companies to build it and try to get a good deal.
[00:57:16.613 --> 00:57:19.014]  Found the cheapest area in Austin.
[00:57:20.535 --> 00:57:22.076]  We're actually kind of out on the edge of Austin.
[00:57:23.517 --> 00:57:27.059]  I'm proud of my crew and what they did, and the people that built the studio, everybody.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:34.224]  So we found a place, moved into it, launched it, made the Obama deception in other films while we were doing it, on top of the radio show and everything.
[00:57:34.704 --> 00:57:43.409]  And it's so hard to go from 10 people in your office to a bigger office in 14 or 15, and then we want to go to the next level of 20, 25, 30 people.
[00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:46.271]  It gets easier once you have the foundation.
[00:57:47.131 --> 00:57:48.654]  And we're now at that launch pad.
[00:57:48.674 --> 00:57:49.596]  We built the rocket.
[00:57:49.636 --> 00:57:50.157]  It's loaded.
[00:57:50.217 --> 00:57:50.758]  It's fueled.
[00:57:51.099 --> 00:57:52.301]  It's got the gantry on it.
[00:57:53.644 --> 00:57:55.648]  As they say, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:57:56.963 --> 00:58:03.945]  And, you know, all the big interviews we have, all the activist groups we have on, all the legislation we battle that's bad, all the good legislation we push.
[00:58:04.385 --> 00:58:08.027]  This is really a fulcrum, or one of the main centers.
[00:58:08.347 --> 00:58:18.290]  I would say the anti-new order movement is a bipolar or double-polar, dose-polar system, with the Ron Paul and then the Alex Jones.
[00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:20.911]  And that's been recognized by many even mainstream writers.
[00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:23.752]  There's that, you know, those title systems.
[00:58:25.177 --> 00:58:35.282]  And Ron Paul is really the gateway into the deeper information we cover, and we are a gateway to people from the more extreme liberty into the Ron Paul revolution.
[00:58:35.722 --> 00:58:37.843]  It is a great symbiotic relationship.
[00:58:38.063 --> 00:58:38.723]  We'll be back.
[00:58:38.783 --> 00:58:39.344]  Stay with us.

[00:59:55.931 --> 00:59:58.832]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.195 --> 01:00:05.856]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.496 --> 01:00:07.556]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.277 --> 01:00:09.377]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.038 --> 01:00:10.838]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.598 --> 01:00:12.379]  Well so does he.
[01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:16.837]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.337 --> 01:00:21.499]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:40.988]  Okay, for the last two hours I've had Ron Paul on, I've covered the VFWs, being told, we're gonna register your knives, your rifles, 150, 160 year old cannons, that old tank out front, that's welded to the ground,
[01:00:42.711 --> 01:00:46.752]  And the DHS lists the veterans as the number one terror group that Homeland Security is set up for.
[01:00:46.792 --> 01:00:47.952]  I always told you it was for you.
[01:00:48.352 --> 01:00:49.433]  This is a criminal takeover.
[01:00:50.393 --> 01:00:51.073]  But it's now happening.
[01:00:51.093 --> 01:00:52.153]  We're taking your calls on that.
[01:00:52.173 --> 01:00:55.234]  Then I'm going to get into a bunch of other issues and financial news.
[01:00:55.274 --> 01:00:59.115]  We've got Walter Williams, the economist, joining us for the first time ever.
[01:00:59.135 --> 01:00:59.715]  That'll be interesting.
[01:01:00.535 --> 01:01:02.336]  We Are Change pops in for like ten minutes.
[01:01:02.596 --> 01:01:07.997]  They did a great job confronting General Myers, who was over the 9-11 attacks in Norad.
[01:01:09.037 --> 01:01:10.719]  And I want to just have them pop in about that.
[01:01:11.099 --> 01:01:20.269]  And we're going to get a quick, at the end of the show, from a press conference that just started on the south side of the Capitol against this bill that openly ends the Fourth Amendment in Texas.
[01:01:20.509 --> 01:01:21.790]  The government could kidnap your children.
[01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:23.772]  No judge, no jury, no order.
[01:01:24.033 --> 01:01:25.915]  CPS are God creatures.
[01:01:25.995 --> 01:01:29.478]  They have the power of Henry VIII, or they have the power of
[01:01:30.677 --> 01:01:31.618]  Yeah, good afternoon Alex.
[01:01:31.638 --> 01:01:32.639]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:01:32.699 --> 01:01:33.459]  I am a veteran.
[01:01:33.479 --> 01:01:40.706]  I was until this year a proud veteran, but I'm quickly losing my pride with things that are going on with the Obama administration.
[01:01:58.035 --> 01:02:03.596]  Tearing me up when you look at the Veterans Hospital and stuff, and the way they've abandoned veterans.
[01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:05.176]  You really got to wonder.
[01:02:05.797 --> 01:02:19.279]  You know, I saw the article last night about the VFW, and it alarmed me because of what happened back in the 80s with the militia groups and banning any military training with militias.
[01:02:20.299 --> 01:02:26.361]  And it did alarm me, so I went to work this morning, and I got a hold of the Washington, D.C.
[01:02:26.481 --> 01:02:27.781]  headquarters of VFW.
[01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:31.352]  And I talked to this fellow who was very perturbed.
[01:02:31.512 --> 01:02:33.754]  His name is Jerry Newberry.
[01:02:34.034 --> 01:02:34.755]  I have his phone number.
[01:02:34.775 --> 01:02:36.135]  I can give it to you offline if you'd like.
[01:02:36.176 --> 01:02:40.439]  Hold on, I had a pen in here and it's been run off with like everything else.
[01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:41.800]  Thank you, sir.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.140]  Just got thrown a pen.
[01:02:43.461 --> 01:02:46.483]  Let me write down these names.
[01:02:46.543 --> 01:02:47.704]  It was Jerry Newberry?
[01:02:48.184 --> 01:02:48.624]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:48.724 --> 01:02:49.465]  Jerry Newberry.
[01:02:49.505 --> 01:02:51.426]  He's Public Relations, Washington, D.C.
[01:02:51.907 --> 01:02:54.569]  He's supposed to be one of the head honchos, Public Relations. 816.
[01:02:57.688 --> 01:02:58.368]  7-5-6-3-3-9-0.
[01:02:59.649 --> 01:03:02.791]  That's a public number?
[01:03:03.511 --> 01:03:06.653]  Yes, so that's... yes.
[01:03:06.733 --> 01:03:09.234]  Okay, 8-1-6-7-5-6-3-3-9-0, okay.
[01:03:09.694 --> 01:03:09.934]  Right.
[01:03:10.935 --> 01:03:18.839]  Now, his... the official version that he gave to me, it seems that the VFW is going to take the side of the government.
[01:03:19.744 --> 01:03:20.564]  Of course they are.
[01:03:20.624 --> 01:03:21.364]  It's going to grovel.
[01:03:21.785 --> 01:03:30.167]  If they told veterans groups to turn their firearms in and throw their kids off cliffs, the leadership of the VFW and all these groups would say, howl Hitler.
[01:03:30.187 --> 01:03:30.527]  Go ahead.
[01:03:30.927 --> 01:03:32.148]  I understand what you're saying.
[01:03:32.188 --> 01:03:32.748]  I really do.
[01:03:33.328 --> 01:03:37.109]  But, you know, first thing, he was very perturbed and he said he was defending Dan West.
[01:03:37.149 --> 01:03:41.210]  He said Dan West, the sergeant, is internal male.
[01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:45.031]  And his words were threatening, not not the government's words.
[01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:47.352]  It was the sergeant's words that were threatening.
[01:03:47.816 --> 01:03:52.660]  And he was trying to motivate the post commanders to comply with the... Oh, motivate them!
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:57.285]  Oh, it's always all in Texas and Kentucky and California confirmed in the news.
[01:03:57.885 --> 01:04:03.610]  It's just base commanders by themselves tell all the troops who live off base to register their private firearms.
[01:04:03.931 --> 01:04:04.911]  It's never the Feds.
[01:04:04.952 --> 01:04:09.376]  It wasn't Obama banning the sale of brass from the military to reloader companies.
[01:04:09.896 --> 01:04:13.980]  You know, Obama hadn't introduced all these gun bills to basically ban the Second Amendment.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.883]  Oh, he didn't call for total gun bans as a state senator?
[01:04:16.903 --> 01:04:22.529]  Oh, his attorney general didn't argue for it last year in federal court, a total national gun ban?
[01:04:23.129 --> 01:04:23.770]  Oh, no!
[01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:26.092]  I mean, these people are sick!
[01:04:26.693 --> 01:04:33.060]  I know, and it gets worse, Alex, because what he says next is alarming because it's so incriminating.
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.021]  Uh, that it's hard to believe.
[01:04:35.181 --> 01:04:35.942]  Now what- Stay there!
[01:04:35.982 --> 01:04:39.585]  I want to hear when you're talking to who you say is a caller, but I believe you.
[01:04:39.605 --> 01:04:40.906]  We'll call and check it, though we haven't confirmed it.
[01:04:41.607 --> 01:04:44.089]  Jerry Newberry, Public Relations, D.C.
[01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:46.531]  And, uh, this is what's happened.
[01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:48.653]  We break the news, thanks to listeners giving us tips.
[01:04:49.413 --> 01:04:52.276]  Everybody will run around and find out it's 50 times worse than even I said.
[01:04:53.036 --> 01:04:55.298]  We'll find out how bad it is on the other side.
[01:04:55.639 --> 01:04:56.259]  Stay there, Mark.
[01:04:56.299 --> 01:04:57.920]  Then Rob, James, Bill, John, and others.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.301]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.618 --> 01:05:09.289]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:05:09.709 --> 01:05:14.435]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:05:14.896 --> 01:05:17.459]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[01:05:17.879 --> 01:05:18.179]  I think so.
[01:05:37.153 --> 01:05:45.421]  Marine Photoplankton, Maca, Goji Berries, Raw Chocolate Cacao, Nibs, Noni, Immune Detox, and more.

[01:06:00.444 --> 01:06:06.011]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[01:06:06.311 --> 01:06:07.473]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:06:07.613 --> 01:06:11.577]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[01:06:11.898 --> 01:06:13.440]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:18.606]  And now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award.
[01:06:18.916 --> 01:06:19.456]  We're good to go.
[01:06:39.586 --> 01:06:41.768]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:06:41.989 --> 01:06:44.251]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.
[01:06:44.471 --> 01:06:46.233]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:06:46.553 --> 01:06:52.018]  Go to www.enerfood.com.

[01:07:00.523 --> 01:07:05.507]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:07:05.728 --> 01:07:09.531]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.751 --> 01:07:15.356]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:15.656 --> 01:07:16.117]  It's true.
[01:07:16.297 --> 01:07:20.521]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.721 --> 01:07:27.106]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:07:27.267 --> 01:07:27.707]  Number four,
[01:07:27.927 --> 01:07:30.571]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:07:30.831 --> 01:07:34.116]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:34.136 --> 01:07:38.221]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[01:07:43.368 --> 01:07:44.689]  A long time sponsor of ours.
[01:07:44.929 --> 01:07:49.471]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.611 --> 01:07:51.152]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.392 --> 01:07:53.733]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[01:08:02.337 --> 01:08:08.360]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:11.942]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.885]  Hoos always gets it when I'm in there plugging in my wires and getting on air.
[01:08:18.905 --> 01:08:20.768]  What was that on purpose in there?
[01:08:21.028 --> 01:08:21.609]  I'm just joking.
[01:08:21.969 --> 01:08:23.431]  Paul Hartman's a great guy, nicknamed Hoos.
[01:08:23.451 --> 01:08:25.935]  Is that because you're a fan of the Hoosiers?
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.361]  Used to live in Indiana, that's right.
[01:08:31.411 --> 01:08:34.812]  Well hell, just living in Indiana will put you on an Al-Qaeda list now.
[01:08:35.893 --> 01:08:41.895]  We're all Al-Qaeda, we're all criminals, we're all bad, we're all in deep trouble, we all have to have Homeland Security run our lives.
[01:08:42.755 --> 01:08:47.597]  Now going back to Mark in Maryland, he says he calls the VFW
[01:08:48.482 --> 01:08:51.124]  Head, a Jerry Newberry.
[01:08:51.164 --> 01:08:54.746]  In fact, guys, look his name up online right now, because I want to call him myself.
[01:08:55.327 --> 01:08:58.869]  I mean, I believe you call her, but I want to check this out for myself, obviously.
[01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:16.201]  Talking about Dan West, and you said what he said next concerning, for those that just joined us, the VFW being told by the Feds and the VATF, turn your guns in and we're going to come SWAT team, basically, you know, register your guns, so we can take a full inventory of it.
[01:09:16.781 --> 01:09:18.002]  Break down what happened next.
[01:09:19.124 --> 01:09:32.972]  Okay, what he said next I found alarming because it was so incriminating, and he said the whole thing boils down to, get this, they are trying to track down weapons that have been lost and turned up at gun shows.
[01:09:33.992 --> 01:09:41.816]  And that's their official story from Mr. Newberry at Public Relations VFW headquarters.
[01:09:41.896 --> 01:09:48.480]  And I'll tell you something, Alex, these crazy nuts calling veterans terrorists
[01:09:49.008 --> 01:09:50.389]  They're about to draw back a stump.
[01:09:53.551 --> 01:09:56.613]  You don't think the vets will say, I guess I am Al-Qaeda.
[01:09:56.653 --> 01:09:58.934]  I guess I didn't know I had us on 9-11.
[01:09:59.435 --> 01:10:01.496]  I guess the red, white, and blue is Al-Qaeda.
[01:10:01.856 --> 01:10:03.097]  Here's my guns.
[01:10:03.577 --> 01:10:06.799]  I didn't know I did the attack, but our government couldn't be wrong.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.881]  Hell, abort the kids.
[01:10:09.261 --> 01:10:10.282]  CPS them all.
[01:10:10.342 --> 01:10:11.602]  Put fluoride in our water.
[01:10:12.663 --> 01:10:13.904]  I'm a terrorist!
[01:10:14.324 --> 01:10:24.289]  I mean, do the vets you talk to know that Homeland Security is listing them as the number one threat and training the police and paramilitary youth squads to take them on?
[01:10:24.589 --> 01:10:26.570]  Here is the New York Times saying it.
[01:10:27.711 --> 01:10:32.994]  Well, I know a few vets that know about it, but to tell you the truth, most are just totally unconscious.
[01:10:33.814 --> 01:10:34.595]  Drinking heavily?
[01:10:34.975 --> 01:10:37.436]  Just don't know anything about what's going on.
[01:10:38.056 --> 01:10:40.978]  And I doubt that this Mr. Newberry knew anything about what was going on.
[01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:43.546]  I asked him the other thing about the M1.
[01:10:43.946 --> 01:10:46.670]  Our local post has been told not to use the M1.
[01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:49.072]  It's been modified for blanks.
[01:10:49.513 --> 01:10:55.460]  They've been told never to use it anymore, or else it would be confiscated, and I asked him about that, and he refused to comment on it.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.923]  And you know, that's the honor guard.
[01:10:59.045 --> 01:11:00.647]  Without the M1, there's no honor guard.
[01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:06.696]  Well, you can't have veterans with guns on TV.
[01:11:06.756 --> 01:11:16.048]  I mean, have you seen all the news reports about where vets will try to carry their VFW rifles in the 4th of July parade and the cops hit them and hit them hard?
[01:11:16.609 --> 01:11:17.350]  Oh, that's crazy.
[01:11:18.231 --> 01:11:18.552]  Jesus.
[01:11:19.477 --> 01:11:21.358]  Well, it's not if you're a slave master.
[01:11:21.378 --> 01:11:27.442]  I mean, America is going to be a Nelly nanny state, but that's only the front.
[01:11:27.502 --> 01:11:36.047]  Right behind it's a black mask and an iron fist, and they are going to... I mean, look, the bankers have openly already bankrupt the nation and stolen more money than we could ever pay back.
[01:11:36.447 --> 01:11:37.988]  So they know that they're in trouble.
[01:11:38.208 --> 01:11:39.249]  You just heard Ron Paul.
[01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:42.831]  I mean, we're this close to getting these criminals in jail.
[01:11:42.891 --> 01:11:45.993]  Imagine if we just exposed them, had them arrested,
[01:11:46.929 --> 01:11:48.590]  We can start by getting our country back.
[01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:51.311]  I mean, we have criminals running the nation.
[01:11:51.691 --> 01:11:53.192]  Of course they're coming after the guns.
[01:11:53.872 --> 01:11:54.993]  But see, this isn't alone.
[01:11:55.033 --> 01:12:00.535]  You add this into Homeland Security saying veterans are the number one threat, training local police that vets are going to attack.
[01:12:00.996 --> 01:12:02.016]  Here's the New York Times.
[01:12:02.456 --> 01:12:09.519]  Ten minutes into the errant mayhem in the town near the Mexican border, and the gunman, a disgruntled Iraq war veteran, has already taken out two people.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.561]  One slumped at a desk, the other covered in blood on the floor.
[01:12:14.966 --> 01:12:19.473]  The responding officers, eight teenage boys and girls, the youngest 14, face tripwire.
[01:12:20.234 --> 01:12:22.677]  A thin cloud of poisonous gas and loud shouts.
[01:12:22.737 --> 01:12:22.898]  Bam!
[01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:23.218]  Bam!
[01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:24.760]  Fire from behind a flimsy wall.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:25.381]  They move quickly.
[01:12:25.822 --> 01:12:27.785]  Pellet guns drawn and masks affixed.
[01:12:28.285 --> 01:12:29.367]  United States Border Patrol.
[01:12:29.627 --> 01:12:30.088]  Hands up!
[01:12:30.168 --> 01:12:31.089]  Screams out one voice.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:41.662]  Now, again, they know Border Patrol's popular, so all these Homeland Security shows and all these shows brainwashing the kids, they call them Border Patrol, but then they practice taking on vets and confiscating guns.
[01:12:42.382 --> 01:12:45.023]  And this goes on all over the nation, not just with the Boy Scouts.
[01:12:45.443 --> 01:12:46.123]  There it is.
[01:12:46.603 --> 01:12:47.163]  Right there.
[01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:49.223]  This is what they're gearing up for.
[01:12:49.303 --> 01:12:50.264]  They admit it!
[01:12:51.204 --> 01:12:54.004]  And I don't think listeners understand, I'm not just saying that.
[01:12:54.364 --> 01:12:56.205]  People email me and say, oh, you're exaggerating.
[01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:56.985]  No, this
[01:12:57.865 --> 01:12:59.907]  You know, you heard the retired cop call in from Missouri.
[01:12:59.927 --> 01:13:07.133]  He said, no, they've already tried to recruit us in the VFW and the Marine Corps Veterans Group to spy on neighbors in Tattle.
[01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:19.383]  I've covered and been sent by listeners the videos of the FBI in every town and city has these meetings where they say, we want your community to come volunteer to help look for terrorists.
[01:13:20.302 --> 01:13:30.488]  And then when you show up to it, they teach you, alright, we're fighting Al-Qaeda, and gun owners, and pot dealers, and we're going to spy on people abusing their kids.
[01:13:30.929 --> 01:13:33.210]  Did you see your neighbor over the fence spat their kid?
[01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.971]  Call police.
[01:13:34.611 --> 01:13:35.531]  Call CPS.
[01:13:35.592 --> 01:13:35.852]  See?
[01:13:36.372 --> 01:13:37.333]  So it sounds good.
[01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:39.354]  Come here and fight Al-Qaeda that hit us.
[01:13:39.674 --> 01:13:41.635]  You get there and they go, okay, Al-Qaeda!
[01:13:41.715 --> 01:13:47.119]  We're going to spend five minutes on Al-Qaeda and the next three days on veterans.
[01:13:48.226 --> 01:13:50.487]  I know some of you are veterans, but you're the good veterans.
[01:13:50.507 --> 01:13:51.388]  There's some bad ones.
[01:13:52.048 --> 01:14:01.513]  Well, what it comes down to is they've turned the entire Patriot Act, something that was adopted, you know, to do a good thing, they've turned the entire thing around on the United States people.
[01:14:02.033 --> 01:14:04.775]  And it's a gun aimed at us, and we're about to get it.
[01:14:04.795 --> 01:14:07.656]  Well, that said, it was a fight.
[01:14:08.497 --> 01:14:08.777]  Go ahead.
[01:14:09.357 --> 01:14:12.379]  I wish we could somehow... I don't know how you could do it.
[01:14:13.052 --> 01:14:16.034]  But sponsor some sort of a million man march on D.C.
[01:14:16.094 --> 01:14:16.774]  Let them know we need them.
[01:14:16.794 --> 01:14:17.515]  Here's the problem.
[01:14:17.615 --> 01:14:20.917]  I couldn't sponsor a 50,000 person march.
[01:14:20.937 --> 01:14:22.437]  It would probably cost 20 grand to fund.
[01:14:23.238 --> 01:14:24.719]  That's why we're having the money bomb tomorrow.
[01:14:25.119 --> 01:14:27.920]  Because everybody keeps saying, and it's true, I need to do more.
[01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:29.702]  And we need the funds to do it.
[01:14:29.722 --> 01:14:31.903]  So buy the books, buy the videos, donate, whatever.
[01:14:32.283 --> 01:14:32.863]  Just support us.
[01:14:32.903 --> 01:14:33.604]  God bless you, sir.
[01:14:33.624 --> 01:14:35.305]  We're going to call those phone numbers.
[01:14:36.568 --> 01:14:40.810]  And folks, don't call too much until I've had a chance to call, but it won't matter.
[01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:49.353]  The media is going to get a hold of this, and you'll see all these quotes in the news about, we can't have veterans with guns, and yeah, these are BATF investigations.
[01:14:49.413 --> 01:14:57.416]  I said first hour about this probably has to do with BATF at gun shows, and this will be their excuse to intimidate the VFW and turn them all into stenches.
[01:14:58.516 --> 01:15:00.257]  And that's now what he was basically saying.
[01:15:00.936 --> 01:15:02.017]  Let's go to more callers.
[01:15:02.317 --> 01:15:05.919]  Let's talk to Rob in Texas and then James, Bill, John and others.
[01:15:05.959 --> 01:15:06.600]  Go ahead, Rob.
[01:15:07.581 --> 01:15:08.621]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:15:08.961 --> 01:15:09.102]  Good.
[01:15:09.122 --> 01:15:10.182]  What do you think is going on here?
[01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:12.204]  Well, I'm not quite sure.
[01:15:12.484 --> 01:15:17.507]  I'm a quartermaster at one of the VFWs here in Texas.
[01:15:17.687 --> 01:15:18.688]  I got this email.
[01:15:18.808 --> 01:15:21.750]  I posted it on one of our forums back on April 22nd.
[01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:28.495]  One of the things I'm kind of wondering about is, there's a requirement for the VFWs to
[01:15:29.747 --> 01:15:34.369]  To report all their ceremonial rifles every three years to TACOM.
[01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:43.993]  And what raises a question in my mind is why all of a sudden they need to inventory everything.
[01:15:44.013 --> 01:15:52.836]  You know, because all these cannons and artillery and everything that the VFW owns except for the ceremonial rifles are all demilled.
[01:15:53.297 --> 01:15:54.157]  They're non-functional.
[01:15:55.236 --> 01:15:55.636]  That's right.
[01:15:55.656 --> 01:16:01.160]  For those who don't know, when you drive in front of a VFW in a little town, you see an army tank and a helicopter.
[01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:13.269]  If it even has the Gatling gun on the Cobra, or if it even has the main gun, the howitzer on the tank, it's been filled.
[01:16:15.311 --> 01:16:17.092]  It's had hot metal poured down into it.
[01:16:17.132 --> 01:16:17.933]  It's been spiked.
[01:16:18.906 --> 01:16:22.448]  And, but the issue is, again, there, you are the terrorist.
[01:16:22.488 --> 01:16:32.773]  This is a way to introduce you to the BATF, introduce you to secret police, where you're intimidated, and you're going to feel good when the BATF and FBI and Homeland Security Office says, oh, it's all right.
[01:16:33.354 --> 01:16:34.114]  You're not in trouble.
[01:16:34.154 --> 01:16:35.475]  We want you to work for us.
[01:16:35.535 --> 01:16:40.457]  And you're thinking about a rival that came up missing ten years ago, and you're going, all right, what do you need to know?
[01:16:40.918 --> 01:16:45.120]  We just want you to fight Al Qaeda, by the way, and watch your neighbors.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:45.960]  No, I'm serious.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:46.901]  That's how this goes.
[01:16:48.247 --> 01:16:56.994]  I know, and I have some concerns with the VFW, especially with the DHS report calling all of us veterans terrorists.
[01:16:59.135 --> 01:17:06.541]  The VFW was, I saw the memo from the National Commander, and they were basically supporting the government's decision to do this.
[01:17:07.176 --> 01:17:08.016]  I remember that!
[01:17:08.036 --> 01:17:18.318]  I remember when the VFW came out on TV and said, I know it seems strange to say the veterans are the number one threat, not even Al-Qaeda, and gun owners are number two and then Al-Qaeda.
[01:17:19.038 --> 01:17:22.599]  Evil vets, evil gun owners, Al-Qaeda.
[01:17:22.619 --> 01:17:27.060]  And that was on national news going, but veterans are bad, they're dangerous.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.540]  And I don't appreciate that.
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:34.121]  The American Legion... Is that because you're with Al-Qaeda, sir?
[01:17:35.168 --> 01:17:36.448]  We may have to take you in.
[01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:42.931]  We may have to take you in for a little bit of waterboarding to make sure.
[01:17:43.131 --> 01:17:45.332]  By the way, they're now waterboarding marijuana suspects.
[01:17:45.392 --> 01:17:46.672]  I have the mainstream news article.
[01:17:47.893 --> 01:17:50.233]  And if you're against waterboarding, maybe you're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:17:50.734 --> 01:17:53.054]  I mean, do you see how this whole thing works now?
[01:17:53.815 --> 01:17:54.175]  Oh yeah.
[01:17:54.575 --> 01:17:59.777]  The whole problem is, is the American public in general is in denial of what's going on.
[01:18:00.495 --> 01:18:02.999]  They think that, oh, everything's going to be okay.
[01:18:03.019 --> 01:18:05.042]  We're going to turn around and vote Republican.
[01:18:06.036 --> 01:18:09.379]  Or do something to where our government isn't going to walk all over us.
[01:18:09.939 --> 01:18:11.120]  I don't see that happening.
[01:18:11.401 --> 01:18:12.041]  No, no, no.
[01:18:12.442 --> 01:18:15.404]  When the Republicans are in power, the right foot steps forward.
[01:18:15.744 --> 01:18:18.106]  And when the Democrats are in power, the left foot steps forward.
[01:18:18.367 --> 01:18:22.550]  Can't we look below the leg, I mean, past the legs and the body in the New World Order?
[01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:30.157]  You've got these international bankers, or the body, yeah, North Com's their arms, the IRS is their mouth to devour us.
[01:18:30.777 --> 01:18:44.664]  And they've just sprouted a new mouth, that's the green taxes, the carbon tax, and sprouting a new mouth, the new oil tax, and it's just a bunch of mouths cramming us into it, and we debate the legs all day instead of the body and the arms and the head.
[01:18:45.004 --> 01:18:45.624]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:18:46.244 --> 01:18:47.345]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:18:48.145 --> 01:18:50.847]  And they're just grabbing whole families, grabbing farms, ranches.
[01:18:51.067 --> 01:18:57.650]  They grabbed GM and just went... And paid to send it overseas.
[01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:08.143]  The whole thing, you know, is until this starts affecting the average everyday person, they're just not going to pay attention, no matter how many people are calling attention to this.
[01:19:08.363 --> 01:19:12.104]  As long as they do it incrementally, the cowards aren't going to wake up.
[01:19:12.144 --> 01:19:24.186]  Look, the cowards are saying Bilderberg doesn't exist, Global Bank doesn't exist, even when it's in hundreds of newspapers, because previously they were told it didn't exist, so they'll look at me and say, I don't care the news says it's real.
[01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:26.247]  It ain't real and you're a kook.
[01:19:27.547 --> 01:19:27.727]  Yeah.
[01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:36.193]  And that's what they, well even on my forums they treat the Infowarriors as a bunch of kooks, which, you know, kind of offends me.
[01:19:36.833 --> 01:19:38.094]  Well they love being slaves.
[01:19:39.455 --> 01:19:41.095]  It's a religion to submit.
[01:19:41.735 --> 01:19:43.636]  A religion to make excuses.
[01:19:43.836 --> 01:19:46.277]  Their 501c3 churches are under federal control publicly.
[01:19:46.517 --> 01:19:48.378]  We broke it two years before it was national news.
[01:19:49.299 --> 01:19:52.660]  Training them to turn their guns in and go to FEMA camps.
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:55.021]  I mean, they're training everybody to get ready for the FEMA camps.
[01:19:55.061 --> 01:19:56.882]  I mean, they're really planning to do this.
[01:19:57.799 --> 01:20:00.424]  And they're gonna take everything you got, all you stupid good ol' boys.
[01:20:00.945 --> 01:20:01.486]  You worry.
[01:20:01.646 --> 01:20:03.710]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.271]  Hi.
[01:20:04.531 --> 01:20:06.976]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:20:07.318 --> 01:20:11.561]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:20:11.862 --> 01:20:14.043]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:20:14.324 --> 01:20:17.386]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:20:17.686 --> 01:20:19.408]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:20:19.608 --> 01:20:22.130]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:25.813]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:20:26.133 --> 01:20:30.217]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:20:30.537 --> 01:20:34.280]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:40.626]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:20:40.946 --> 01:20:43.088]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:20:43.308 --> 01:20:44.989]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:49.634]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:20:50.074 --> 01:20:50.714]  Start now.
[01:20:50.995 --> 01:20:51.936]  Knowledge is power.
[01:20:52.716 --> 01:20:53.517]  Better take action.
[01:20:53.717 --> 01:20:54.658]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:21:01.837 --> 01:21:03.817]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources.
[01:21:03.837 --> 01:21:07.258]  800-686-2237, extension 128.
[01:21:07.978 --> 01:21:09.618]  And let's take in a brief mind movie.
[01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:15.579]  We're surrounded by jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[01:21:15.779 --> 01:21:21.380]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:23.241]  The stimulus package is working.
[01:21:23.581 --> 01:21:25.121]  A bailout is coming your way.
[01:21:25.461 --> 01:21:29.382]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[01:21:29.662 --> 01:21:29.982]  Pardon me?
[01:21:30.802 --> 01:21:31.782]  Back to the real world.
[01:21:32.042 --> 01:21:36.004]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[01:21:36.304 --> 01:21:38.325]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[01:21:38.885 --> 01:21:40.345]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[01:21:40.585 --> 01:21:51.349]  Please call me, John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, to discuss investing in precious metals, gold and silver, with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.
[01:21:52.049 --> 01:21:59.032]  I'm John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and together we'll create a package that really works for you.
[01:22:01.388 --> 01:22:06.712]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.212 --> 01:22:14.237]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:22:14.793 --> 01:22:20.955]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:21.295 --> 01:22:23.195]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:25.756]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:25.856 --> 01:22:36.799]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.421 --> 01:22:38.722]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.082 --> 01:22:40.482]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:40.943 --> 01:22:47.305]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.846 --> 01:22:55.649]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:56.109 --> 01:22:57.270]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.690 --> 01:22:58.951]  The people strike back.
[01:23:02.112 --> 01:23:03.973]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck, E-Food
[01:23:07.756 --> 01:23:07.976]  I'm good.
[01:23:30.998 --> 01:23:31.538]  I think so.
[01:24:08.318 --> 01:24:23.821]  Huge news blitzes coming up.
[01:24:23.861 --> 01:24:25.401]  Just tons of vital info.
[01:24:26.241 --> 01:24:28.182]  Waterboarding marijuana suspects.
[01:24:29.002 --> 01:24:30.422]  Government now saying they're going to do that.
[01:24:30.922 --> 01:24:32.682]  Notice they say, oh we're not spying on you.
[01:24:32.702 --> 01:24:35.003]  Then, oh we are spying, but it's only off-door Al-Qaeda.
[01:24:35.323 --> 01:24:35.843]  And the courts
[01:24:37.441 --> 01:24:39.762]  And Congress say they can have no more Fourth Amendment.
[01:24:39.802 --> 01:24:42.962]  They say, yeah, we're going to spy on everybody for everything.
[01:24:44.003 --> 01:24:45.123]  And, oh, we can waterboard?
[01:24:45.163 --> 01:24:45.883]  That's not torture.
[01:24:45.903 --> 01:24:48.884]  We're going to waterboard you for anything we want.
[01:24:48.904 --> 01:24:57.506]  They already have pressure compliance, pain compliance, where they court ruled last week in the U.S.
[01:24:57.986 --> 01:25:01.087]  They can taser you to make you talk, to make you give DNA.
[01:25:02.918 --> 01:25:03.860]  Oh, that's not torture!
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:08.788]  50,000 volts into somebody when they don't answer your questions.
[01:25:10.137 --> 01:25:12.399]  And they say, to make you talk, but it's not torture.
[01:25:12.799 --> 01:25:14.660]  Incredible pain, excruciating pain.
[01:25:14.941 --> 01:25:19.844]  You know, when he's electrocuting Winston Smith in 1984, O'Brien is?
[01:25:20.285 --> 01:25:21.005]  It's not torture?
[01:25:21.506 --> 01:25:22.006]  No!
[01:25:22.306 --> 01:25:23.807]  And that's exactly what O'Brien would say.
[01:25:23.827 --> 01:25:28.591]  This isn't torture, this is medical aid I'm giving you, Winston.
[01:25:28.731 --> 01:25:30.593]  Oh, let me pull that tooth out with pliers.
[01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:31.353]  Oh, yeah.
[01:25:31.773 --> 01:25:32.874]  Oh, that's not torture.
[01:25:33.435 --> 01:25:35.937]  And again, there's not a world government, we're just announcing it.
[01:25:38.018 --> 01:25:45.702]  You know, all the veterans, we're going to SWAT team you, if you don't report that old cannon you've got from the Civil War.
[01:25:46.403 --> 01:25:49.245]  This is about making the military.
[01:25:49.865 --> 01:25:52.086]  Veterans, you're going to be sub-citizens now.
[01:25:52.506 --> 01:25:55.788]  You're going to be spied on, hated, watched, not able to own firearms.
[01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:57.269]  It's all being announced.
[01:25:57.729 --> 01:26:00.731]  I told you years ago you were the number one terror threat to Homeland Security.
[01:26:01.732 --> 01:26:02.712]  I've been to the training drills.
[01:26:02.772 --> 01:26:05.594]  NORTHCOM is for you, and it's for me, a gun owner.
[01:26:07.364 --> 01:26:10.866]  You were going along with it, going, yeah, fight them brown Al-Qaeda's!
[01:26:11.146 --> 01:26:13.067]  Those brown Al-Qaeda's work for the bankers.
[01:26:14.287 --> 01:26:20.270]  Let's go ahead and go to James in the UK, then Bill, John, Mark, and others.
[01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.990]  Go ahead, James.
[01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:23.571]  Hello?
[01:26:24.111 --> 01:26:24.472]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:24.492 --> 01:26:25.812]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:25.832 --> 01:26:27.453]  Firstly, I'm going to have to apologize to you.
[01:26:27.533 --> 01:26:30.394]  I didn't know you only wanted to talk about it today, so I can't listen to you live.
[01:26:30.414 --> 01:26:31.094]  Well, that's okay.
[01:26:31.114 --> 01:26:31.995]  Since you're here, go ahead.
[01:26:33.224 --> 01:26:48.170]  First I wanted to bring to your attention a big news article we've got here today on Sky News, and the headline is London Police Accused of Water Torture, and I emphasize the word torture, where basically six London police officers have been suspended for waterboarding for drug suspicion.
[01:26:48.783 --> 01:26:49.723]  Yeah, same thing here.
[01:26:49.823 --> 01:26:50.143]  No, no.
[01:26:50.283 --> 01:26:51.704]  Everybody's going to be tortured.
[01:26:52.244 --> 01:26:57.626]  They're going to increase the tasers from 50,000 watts or volts to 70,000.
[01:26:58.326 --> 01:27:03.628]  And they are going to make you on airplanes wear a shock necklace and shock bracelet.
[01:27:03.648 --> 01:27:04.908]  Homeland Security announced it.
[01:27:05.288 --> 01:27:06.049]  People didn't believe it.
[01:27:06.129 --> 01:27:12.211]  In fact, guys, YouTube, taser bracelets for air travel.
[01:27:12.551 --> 01:27:16.072]  And then the company that did this, Homeland Security, is considering
[01:27:17.097 --> 01:27:19.359]  Making you wear... And it's like, it's freedom!
[01:27:19.419 --> 01:27:22.082]  Everybody gets a shock necklace in America!
[01:27:22.342 --> 01:27:23.644]  What are you, with Al-Qaeda?
[01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:30.891]  I mean, it's just total... How is that not insanity, that we'll all be wearing shock necklaces and bracelets?
[01:27:30.911 --> 01:27:31.932]  Does that sound like freedom?
[01:27:32.772 --> 01:27:34.834]  Nothing surprises me in this world anymore.
[01:27:35.075 --> 01:27:36.336]  No, no, I'm not kidding, sir!
[01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:37.257]  I'm not kidding!
[01:27:37.577 --> 01:27:38.978]  I'm not kidding about this!
[01:27:39.779 --> 01:27:41.261]  They'd just shoot us in the head if they could.
[01:27:42.264 --> 01:27:43.284]  Well, that's next.
[01:27:43.344 --> 01:27:44.825]  Will, they do that in Fallujah.
[01:27:44.845 --> 01:27:51.148]  If you don't have your ID in order, I have Tom Brokaw, right before he retired, saying they line the families up, they don't have the cards, they're all shot.
[01:27:52.968 --> 01:27:53.869]  God is my witness.
[01:27:54.029 --> 01:27:55.629]  I have Tom Brokaw saying that.
[01:27:55.649 --> 01:27:57.390]  I've played it four or five years.
[01:27:57.650 --> 01:27:57.970]  I'm sorry.
[01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:58.831]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:27:58.871 --> 01:27:59.751]  You go ahead and make your point.
[01:28:01.112 --> 01:28:03.533]  Yeah, basically I just wanted to bring my article to everyone's attention.
[01:28:03.593 --> 01:28:06.874]  If they want to Google it, the headline is London Police Accused of Water Torture.
[01:28:07.373 --> 01:28:23.032]  And also, I wanted to... I know you've got quite a few UK listeners, and I wanted them to point them into the direction of a new website we've released for UK people, against the New World Order, and the URL is www.freetourmindnow.tk.
[01:28:24.912 --> 01:28:41.321]  Because basically we realised there wasn't any real sites targeted for the UK people and British people have a huge tendency to go, oh the New World Order, yeah that's the sort of things we want to take over America and try and take the new world out of the sentence and just say, oh that's just America.
[01:28:41.381 --> 01:28:43.742]  So we wanted to bring awareness into this country as well.
[01:28:44.343 --> 01:28:46.264]  So just wanted to plug that website as well.
[01:28:47.441 --> 01:28:48.502]  All right, well thank you so much.
[01:28:48.522 --> 01:28:49.082]  Good to hear from you.
[01:28:49.122 --> 01:28:51.264]  Let's jam in one more and then continue after the break.
[01:28:52.105 --> 01:28:54.667]  Let's talk to Bill in Connecticut, probably another evil gun owner.
[01:28:55.027 --> 01:28:57.209]  Terrorist, do you own a firearm, sir?
[01:28:57.829 --> 01:28:58.790]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[01:28:58.890 --> 01:28:59.751]  Do you own a firearm?
[01:29:00.491 --> 01:29:01.052]  Absolutely.
[01:29:01.292 --> 01:29:02.153]  Okay, we got a terrorist.
[01:29:02.213 --> 01:29:02.693]  I'm serious.
[01:29:02.733 --> 01:29:04.534]  You are, according to the federal government, a terrorist.
[01:29:04.574 --> 01:29:05.275]  Number one threat.
[01:29:05.695 --> 01:29:06.656]  North Com is for you.
[01:29:06.956 --> 01:29:07.997]  Terrorist, what do you have to say?
[01:29:08.658 --> 01:29:09.558]  I'm a scary guy.
[01:29:10.919 --> 01:29:15.483]  In any case, hey Alex, I just wanted to point out a couple things to you here.
[01:29:16.212 --> 01:29:20.636]  That you've said on a few other shows, and I can't believe this.
[01:29:20.656 --> 01:29:23.139]  I was sitting there reading yesterday, doing my laundry.
[01:29:23.679 --> 01:29:24.520]  In The Economist.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:25.982]  Okay?
[01:29:26.582 --> 01:29:31.587]  In The Economist, they turn around on, I don't have the page here, but it's their new technology thing.
[01:29:32.208 --> 01:29:33.749]  The Spies in the Skies.
[01:29:33.809 --> 01:29:36.472]  Military technology with blimps equipped with remote sensing.
[01:29:36.512 --> 01:29:38.614]  This is in The Economist.
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:40.140]  Doesn't exist.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.821]  Economist doesn't exist either, sir.
[01:29:41.861 --> 01:29:45.083]  You're having a mass schizophrenic event with me right now.
[01:29:45.103 --> 01:29:48.645]  This video of troops confiscating guns, preparing for it, not real either.
[01:29:48.665 --> 01:29:48.966]  Stay there.
[01:29:48.986 --> 01:29:49.366]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.386 --> 01:29:50.286]  I want to hear the rest of it.
[01:29:51.227 --> 01:29:52.107]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.608 --> 01:29:54.209]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:57.831]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:07.278 --> 01:30:10.041]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:30:10.242 --> 01:30:13.105]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:30:13.285 --> 01:30:19.152]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:30:19.372 --> 01:30:22.295]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[01:32:00.638 --> 01:32:09.302]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:32:09.722 --> 01:32:14.444]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:32:14.904 --> 01:32:19.527]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals actually results in disease.

[01:33:13.223 --> 01:33:35.568]  They've confronted General Richard Myers, Vice President Joe Biden, ex-CFR President Lindsey Glebe, LA County Sheriff Lee Baca, LAPD Chief Bratton three times, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, CIA Case Officer Robert Baer, General Wesley Cart, Summer Redstone, CIA Director Michael V. Hayden, what an effeminate demon,
[01:33:37.148 --> 01:33:40.710]  Shannon, Representative Grace Napolitano, L.A.
[01:33:41.050 --> 01:33:48.833]  City Council, Scott McClellan, Mike Revell, Simon Wiesenthal Center, David Frum, Jane Harmon, Mitt Romney.
[01:33:49.133 --> 01:33:56.717]  They confronted the Simon Wiesenthal Center because they went before Congress and said, anybody who's a 9-11 truth is a Nazi Al-Qaeda.
[01:33:56.737 --> 01:33:58.357]  I mean, we've got the video in Congress.
[01:33:58.637 --> 01:34:01.859]  They said, architects and engineers from 9-11 Truth hate Jews.
[01:34:02.299 --> 01:34:03.720]  Nothing to do, we don't talk about...
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:07.001]  I mean, they're the ones pushing anti-Semitism.
[01:34:07.622 --> 01:34:09.462]  And it makes people go, ooh, why are you covering up 9-11?
[01:34:09.522 --> 01:34:12.104]  I mean, it interjects it into it.
[01:34:13.464 --> 01:34:14.765]  That's coming up in about five minutes.
[01:34:15.205 --> 01:34:17.706]  I wanted to finish up with a caller, if he's still there.
[01:34:19.107 --> 01:34:19.848]  Who was I talking to?
[01:34:19.908 --> 01:34:20.588]  Bill in Connecticut?
[01:34:22.196 --> 01:34:23.317]  Okay, Bill, you still there?
[01:34:23.697 --> 01:34:24.037]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:24.598 --> 01:34:27.640]  Okay, so, at any rate... Hold on, hold on, hold on just a second, though.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:33.125]  I'm not... Listen, it's not, ooh, Alex told me about secret surveillance blimps and now the news admits it.
[01:34:33.525 --> 01:34:34.546]  It's been admitted!
[01:34:35.026 --> 01:34:48.657]  It's just, I go on national shows and they laugh at me and say, he believes there's big blimps, everybody knows they're flying saucers, and I go, no, it's a government, homeland security blimp, here's the government purchase order, and the media laughs, but go ahead.
[01:34:49.077 --> 01:34:50.198]  Yeah, well, no, I just, you know,
[01:34:50.874 --> 01:34:51.794]  I just found it amazing.
[01:34:51.834 --> 01:34:56.517]  I mean, I'm sitting there doing my laundry and I said, Oh my God, it's the same thing it was on Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:56.537 --> 01:34:57.337]  You gotta be kidding.
[01:34:57.357 --> 01:35:02.700]  At any rate, there's one other thing I wanted to point out here today on today's MSNBC.com.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:04.881]  Okay.
[01:35:04.901 --> 01:35:11.504]  The other story that you were talking about pertaining to the grandmother who was zapped by the cop in Austin.
[01:35:12.504 --> 01:35:12.725]  Yes.
[01:35:13.525 --> 01:35:15.806]  This is on, I'm looking at it right now.
[01:35:15.886 --> 01:35:17.827]  Today's MSNBC.com.
[01:35:18.499 --> 01:35:23.484]  They say here, great-grandmother dared cop, dared the cop to tase her.
[01:35:24.084 --> 01:35:25.406]  So he did, and they have the film.
[01:35:26.146 --> 01:35:29.870]  It says, woman 72 refused to sign traffic ticket.
[01:35:30.751 --> 01:35:32.412]  An argument and then a zap.
[01:35:32.833 --> 01:35:36.796]  And then she finally submitted and said, I'll do it, and that's when he zapped her.
[01:35:37.237 --> 01:35:39.899]  And the mainstream media, they just released this two days ago.
[01:35:39.919 --> 01:35:42.262]  We were talking about weeks ago before they released it.
[01:35:43.359 --> 01:35:47.740]  And of course, his story is not exactly what he said, and her story isn't exactly what she said.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.780]  That's normally how it is.
[01:35:49.261 --> 01:35:54.302]  But the issue is the media loves it, legitimizing, look, tasering women for not signing tickets is good!
[01:35:54.322 --> 01:35:56.783]  And that message is... That's excessive force, man!
[01:35:58.803 --> 01:36:01.884]  Well, look, pretty soon they're going to line well women up and blow their heads off.
[01:36:02.484 --> 01:36:04.985]  And if the yuppies think that's going to get them some money, they'll do it.
[01:36:05.005 --> 01:36:08.486]  So, you've got to worry about the government and then the sheep.
[01:36:08.526 --> 01:36:09.706]  The sheep are very dangerous.
[01:36:10.362 --> 01:36:10.582]  Right.
[01:36:10.983 --> 01:36:19.870]  Well, the other thing I wanted to just mention real quick, when I called you the other week when you had Jesse Ventura on, did I hear him correctly?
[01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:27.156]  I mean, was he like selling out, sitting there saying, give me the post in Cuba so I can go down there and drink rum and smoke cigars and I'll do whatever you say?
[01:36:27.196 --> 01:36:27.976]  Was that what he was saying?
[01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:30.158]  I didn't hear him say that.
[01:36:30.318 --> 01:36:34.602]  I mean, it's a joke saying I would love to be the first ambassador to Cuba.
[01:36:37.734 --> 01:36:43.722]  Yeah, I mean in a way he's saying, he's obsessed with scuba diving and the beach and surfing.
[01:36:44.143 --> 01:36:44.744]  Sure.
[01:36:45.004 --> 01:36:48.249]  And so the joke was, I want a job.
[01:36:49.417 --> 01:36:58.585]  Yeah, he's saying, no, it was in the body of discussion, I mean it's all the connotation it's in, it's all how it's framed.
[01:36:58.625 --> 01:37:05.211]  He's saying we ought to open up Cuba, 50 years of sanctions is stupid, I'll be the first ambassador.
[01:37:05.592 --> 01:37:08.514]  So it was a joke, but I bet if he was offered it he'd take it, yeah.
[01:37:08.935 --> 01:37:10.656]  Because he agrees with that policy.
[01:37:11.617 --> 01:37:19.722]  And I would tell Jesse to take that post, because then we'd have a 9-11 truther as the ambassador to Cuba, and we could have him on the show and get even more influence.
[01:37:20.703 --> 01:37:21.383]  Right, right, right.
[01:37:21.703 --> 01:37:22.824]  I don't think it's a sellout.
[01:37:23.745 --> 01:37:24.885]  Alright, no, that's cool.
[01:37:24.985 --> 01:37:27.827]  I just, you know, when I was hearing that, I was like going, whoa, are you kidding?
[01:37:28.708 --> 01:37:30.509]  Well, I mean, I don't think he said, I'm going to sell out.
[01:37:30.549 --> 01:37:31.790]  He said, give me the post in Cuba.
[01:37:32.630 --> 01:37:32.870]  Right.
[01:37:33.851 --> 01:37:34.451]  Anyway, alright.
[01:37:34.551 --> 01:37:37.193]  Well, we all know it's not going to happen, so let's not hold our breath.
[01:37:37.533 --> 01:37:37.913]  There you go.
[01:37:38.174 --> 01:37:40.335]  Anyway, I'm going to send you some money for your money bomb.
[01:37:41.329 --> 01:37:42.951]  And keep up the good work.
[01:37:42.991 --> 01:37:44.151]  You're doing a hell of a job.
[01:37:44.532 --> 01:37:45.392]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:37:45.413 --> 01:37:45.993]  I appreciate it.
[01:37:46.073 --> 01:37:47.434]  Yeah.
[01:37:47.694 --> 01:37:48.315]  What is 30,000 times 12?
[01:37:48.355 --> 01:37:49.075]  What's 30 times 12?
[01:37:49.115 --> 01:37:50.857]  $360,000 a year in IT bills here at this office.
[01:37:50.877 --> 01:37:50.857]  $360,000.
[01:37:51.017 --> 01:37:54.460]  Over $20,000 of that is bandwidth and then the two IT guys.
[01:38:12.657 --> 01:38:21.585]  Folks, I mean, I have to sit here and hustle just to, it's like a locomotive going towards the New World Order on the tracks.
[01:38:22.145 --> 01:38:23.566]  And I'm shoveling coal in.
[01:38:24.347 --> 01:38:30.272]  And so I end up spending my time trying to make the money to pay for websites getting millions of views a week.
[01:38:30.552 --> 01:38:36.758]  To pay to serve out, what's 150,000 free podcasts six days a week?
[01:38:36.818 --> 01:38:37.398]  What's six times 150,000?
[01:38:40.441 --> 01:38:44.442]  That's almost a million four-hour podcasts.
[01:38:44.462 --> 01:38:45.443]  That costs a lot of money.
[01:38:45.903 --> 01:38:54.426]  I mean, literally, I've got a decent house and a decent car.
[01:38:54.726 --> 01:38:56.266]  It's a Chrysler car.
[01:38:56.867 --> 01:38:57.587]  Nothing fancy.
[01:38:58.507 --> 01:39:00.148]  And that is that much of my money.
[01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:05.871]  I mean, you know, eating decent food, taking care of my kids and my wife is that much.
[01:39:06.451 --> 01:39:08.071]  Here's the money this operation makes.
[01:39:08.851 --> 01:39:10.212]  Here's the money this operation makes.
[01:39:10.532 --> 01:39:11.612]  Here's the money I'm keeping.
[01:39:14.693 --> 01:39:16.374]  That's how I can get up here and ask for money.
[01:39:16.534 --> 01:39:23.236]  And then people say, you know, on YouTube, man, he doesn't look like a televangelist asking for money.
[01:39:25.313 --> 01:39:27.454]  He looks sincere, because I am sincere.
[01:39:28.034 --> 01:39:30.835]  I'm sincerely waging war on the New World Order.
[01:39:31.515 --> 01:39:33.475]  I'm sincerely risking my life.
[01:39:34.696 --> 01:39:36.716]  I'm sincerely taking on the globalists.
[01:39:37.356 --> 01:39:41.258]  I'm sincerely breaking massive news story after massive news story.
[01:39:41.578 --> 01:39:46.359]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are treasures.
[01:39:48.119 --> 01:39:49.340]  They are treasures.
[01:39:50.325 --> 01:39:52.587]  Because we can break major stories.
[01:39:52.947 --> 01:40:02.953]  You heard the caller earlier, I have no reason to doubt him, saying a month ago he posted on their forum the VFW order to register all their firearms and old equipment.
[01:40:04.014 --> 01:40:06.556]  For basically for confiscation down the road by the BATF.
[01:40:07.596 --> 01:40:08.657]  And I'm sure he did.
[01:40:08.717 --> 01:40:11.019]  The point is we got it, we put it out, now it's big.
[01:40:12.304 --> 01:40:18.795]  Whatever we put out ends up in the news because we do the research, we have the documents, we make the phone calls, we put it out, it breaks.
[01:40:19.215 --> 01:40:24.384]  Do you know the value of being able to warn people about federal and state legislation that's bad?
[01:40:25.742 --> 01:40:36.967]  There were people for weeks fighting this bill that had passed the House, going to the Governor's desk to be able to kidnap people's kids with no Fourth Amendment, with no judge, jury, order, nothing.
[01:40:37.568 --> 01:40:39.028]  Without parents even being told, ever.
[01:40:39.608 --> 01:40:40.329]  Just, where's my kid?
[01:40:40.369 --> 01:40:40.709]  I don't know.
[01:40:41.389 --> 01:40:43.971]  Snatch and grab, like CIA and Abu Ghraib.
[01:40:45.631 --> 01:40:48.213]  Literal snatch and grab type ops.
[01:40:49.633 --> 01:40:51.134]  They grab your kid, they're in a van, gone.
[01:40:53.288 --> 01:40:56.989]  We put that up Friday, and then it was all over the news and everywhere this week.
[01:40:57.289 --> 01:41:08.013]  I mean, literally, the Wall Street Journal's doing a big cover story on me, Psychology Today has a bunch of other big papers, and of course there are going to be hit pieces, but I can't turn them down, because then, you know, they'll just be their side.
[01:41:08.133 --> 01:41:09.513]  None of what I have to say will be in there.
[01:41:09.533 --> 01:41:12.414]  And they'll say, Alex refused to be, you know, talked to for this.
[01:41:13.574 --> 01:41:15.155]  But they're saying, why are you so big?
[01:41:15.215 --> 01:41:16.515]  Why is everybody talking about you?
[01:41:16.555 --> 01:41:17.976]  Why is there this buzz everywhere?
[01:41:18.976 --> 01:41:21.297]  And folks, it is everywhere.
[01:41:22.248 --> 01:41:31.117]  I can go to Alabama, I can go to New York, I can walk into the first restaurant I go into, I can walk out on the beach in South Texas and people walk up.
[01:41:31.717 --> 01:41:37.743]  My uncle was telling me in East Texas that, and he doesn't go to the store but maybe once a week, he's a farmer.
[01:41:38.752 --> 01:42:03.826]  and uh... keeps the ranch up and things and and and he said just everywhere he went to the station fifty miles out or something goes into that area east texas an affiliate and he said did you just buzz everywhere everyone's talking about i mean folks this radio show the the websites the films i'm going to we are changing moment i'm sorry i'm like it done this is all just absolutely amazing
[01:42:05.524 --> 01:42:12.226]  And I know I babble, I know I stutter, I know I'm goofy, I know I act stupid, I know... but I'm real, folks!
[01:42:12.666 --> 01:42:15.808]  And I've got a good brain, and I understand what the enemy's doing.
[01:42:16.308 --> 01:42:18.408]  I understand what they're doing a lot better.
[01:42:18.428 --> 01:42:23.130]  I'm a lot better at that than my communication skills, which people seem to think are pretty good.
[01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:24.711]  I think they're not that good.
[01:42:25.311 --> 01:42:26.431]  And I get your criticisms.
[01:42:26.671 --> 01:42:27.551]  A lot of it's legitimate.
[01:42:27.631 --> 01:42:28.032]  I know.
[01:42:28.372 --> 01:42:30.132]  I'm a sorry excuse for a human being.
[01:42:30.713 --> 01:42:32.153]  But I'm doing the best I can.
[01:42:34.394 --> 01:42:34.854]  And, uh...
[01:42:35.936 --> 01:42:45.420]  I'll take 100% of this money bomb, and depending on how much comes in, I'll hire a couple of video editors, a couple of webmasters, a moderator for the site, maybe more if we have some, or I'm going to have to shut down the comments.
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:48.941]  It's getting really dangerous with the setups and things that are going on there.
[01:42:49.962 --> 01:42:53.123]  We're going to maybe even get the space next to us, which is available.
[01:42:53.383 --> 01:42:58.946]  The economy is falling apart around here, so the warehouse space next to us that I couldn't afford a year ago, or when we signed the lease,
[01:43:00.126 --> 01:43:01.147]  At least about 10 months ago.
[01:43:01.687 --> 01:43:07.530]  It's now almost, it's a little over a third, about 40% of the price it was a year ago.
[01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:11.472]  So I said, oh, I can't get more space, but now they haven't leased it and it's sitting there.
[01:43:12.152 --> 01:43:14.433]  I need that room to do the official TV studio.
[01:43:14.453 --> 01:43:15.293]  Look at all we've done.
[01:43:15.774 --> 01:43:20.456]  So tomorrow, tonight at midnight, start giving and in the morning we'll put the numbers in.
[01:43:20.496 --> 01:43:22.557]  You can see throughout the day how much is coming in.
[01:43:22.577 --> 01:43:23.537]  There's going to be a phone number.
[01:43:23.857 --> 01:43:26.759]  You can give multiple places, credit card, PayPal.
[01:43:28.690 --> 01:43:37.219]  And it will all go to equipment and expanding what we're doing and you will see within months the measurable change and the expansion of what we're doing here.
[01:43:39.782 --> 01:43:45.408]  And look, I've pledged my name, my blood, my sacred honor, everything on fighting the New World Order.
[01:43:45.488 --> 01:43:46.369]  I don't have a choice now.
[01:43:46.909 --> 01:43:47.510]  I'm going in 110%.
[01:43:52.597 --> 01:43:54.178]  I don't like having to do all this extra work.
[01:43:54.298 --> 01:43:59.342]  I don't enjoy having to hire new people and worry of their feds trying to set me up, because that stuff goes on, folks.
[01:44:00.342 --> 01:44:03.604]  I don't enjoy, at this point, being on the spotlight, because now it's dangerous.
[01:44:04.225 --> 01:44:09.608]  It was fun ten years ago, and still a little bit dangerous, but now it's, you know, now it's white knuckle.
[01:44:09.668 --> 01:44:11.149]  It's, man, this is real.
[01:44:11.290 --> 01:44:20.095]  This is, I am now, with the enemy, fully aware of who I am, concerned about me, and they will, they'll kill a million, three hundred thousand Iraqis and think nothing of it.
[01:44:20.356 --> 01:44:21.636]  So we're going to, we are changing a moment.
[01:44:21.656 --> 01:44:21.997]  I've done
[01:44:22.837 --> 01:44:25.821]  Two hours and 44 minutes and haven't plugged on air any of the sponsors.
[01:44:25.841 --> 01:44:28.163]  And these are the folks that make the show possible.
[01:44:28.203 --> 01:44:31.227]  If we made enough off the money bomb, even though these are great sponsors, you wouldn't hear them here.
[01:44:31.567 --> 01:44:32.869]  Because I'd rather just cover news.
[01:44:33.509 --> 01:44:35.291]  But here are the sponsors making the show possible.
[01:44:35.712 --> 01:44:36.293]  One of them is...
[01:44:38.965 --> 01:44:40.326]  Atmospheric water generator for your home.
[01:44:40.386 --> 01:44:42.508]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[01:44:42.548 --> 01:44:43.889]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[01:44:44.169 --> 01:44:45.591]  Unlimited water for the humidity in the air.
[01:44:45.871 --> 01:44:47.092]  Knows exactly what you're drinking.
[01:44:47.272 --> 01:44:49.334]  Machine produces up to 7.5 gallons a day.
[01:44:49.734 --> 01:44:50.875]  They got bigger ones if you want them.
[01:44:51.195 --> 01:44:54.518]  Generated water has passed through seven filters, including reverse osmosis and carbon.
[01:44:54.838 --> 01:44:55.419]  Simple to use.
[01:44:55.459 --> 01:44:57.400]  No chemicals, pollutants, toxins, neutral pH.
[01:44:57.721 --> 01:44:59.022]  Your own source of clean drinking water.
[01:44:59.642 --> 01:45:00.903]  And it's just a really great system.
[01:45:00.923 --> 01:45:01.503]  Give them a call.
[01:45:01.703 --> 01:45:05.445]  Get your atmospheric water generator today.
[01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:05.725]  1-800-691-6043.
[01:45:06.025 --> 01:45:06.685]  Get off the grid.
[01:45:06.725 --> 01:45:07.566]  Get self-sufficient.
[01:45:07.986 --> 01:45:12.708]  You know there's no fluoride in this, boys and girls, because this doesn't come out of a water system, even if you try to filter it.
[01:45:13.528 --> 01:45:15.049]  You know, normal stuff's hard to get it out.
[01:45:15.069 --> 01:45:15.889]  800-691-6043 or acolablue.com.
[01:45:15.929 --> 01:45:16.589]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com today.
[01:45:23.365 --> 01:45:30.570]  One other sponsor I want to tell you about is eFoods Direct, the best storable foods company out there, where I have chosen to get my storable foods.
[01:45:30.610 --> 01:45:33.772]  I bought them at a few other places and didn't like what I got with MSG and fillers.
[01:45:34.072 --> 01:45:39.996]  This is high quality stuff, very inexpensive, great price, non-GMO, non-hybrid, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:45:47.114 --> 01:45:54.398]  And you can get a free brochure, watch their free videos online about all the great food products and lines and stoves and water filters and all the other great stuff they've got.
[01:45:54.878 --> 01:45:56.259]  Call and get a free brochure today.
[01:45:56.339 --> 01:45:57.099]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:45:57.139 --> 01:45:59.000]  Don't wait on your family's future and security.
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:00.441]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:46:00.461 --> 01:46:02.182]  That's efoodsdirect.com.
[01:46:02.202 --> 01:46:02.342]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:46:02.382 --> 01:46:08.065]  And as I said, check them out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:46:08.185 --> 01:46:08.445]  Okay.
[01:46:09.665 --> 01:46:11.288]  I've got these guys on here with us.
[01:46:11.308 --> 01:46:14.493]  I've got Walter Williams, the economist, coming on at the start of the next hour.
[01:46:14.793 --> 01:46:18.679]  He's only got ten minutes of air time with our guys, so I appreciate him joining us.
[01:46:18.759 --> 01:46:21.384]  Bruno Braweiler.
[01:46:25.069 --> 01:46:31.291]  uh... joins us as well and uh... Stuart Howe and uh... there's a whole bunch of folks one of the most active We Are Change.
[01:46:31.311 --> 01:46:32.651]  These are just grassroots groups.
[01:46:32.951 --> 01:46:34.411]  You believe 9-11 is an inside job?
[01:46:34.451 --> 01:46:35.452]  Government sponsored terror?
[01:46:35.692 --> 01:46:36.852]  You want to defeat the New World Order?
[01:46:36.872 --> 01:46:38.012]  You can create your own We Are Change.
[01:46:38.252 --> 01:46:39.433]  There's no central group.
[01:46:39.933 --> 01:46:42.293]  I get calls saying, are you the head of We Are Change?
[01:46:42.313 --> 01:46:43.214]  Are you secretly running?
[01:46:43.594 --> 01:46:43.734]  No!
[01:46:44.594 --> 01:46:46.415]  I don't even know 99% of these people.
[01:46:46.455 --> 01:46:50.098]  These are volunteers out asking real questions at media events.
[01:46:50.178 --> 01:46:52.320]  General Meyers is quite a snake.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:54.261]  Stuart Howe, Bruno, Jeremy.
[01:46:54.961 --> 01:46:55.842]  I've got this video.
[01:46:55.862 --> 01:46:56.943]  We posted it days ago.
[01:46:56.963 --> 01:47:02.347]  I know it's at WeAreChangeLA.org.
[01:47:03.207 --> 01:47:04.768]  But we're going to play some of it after the break.
[01:47:04.788 --> 01:47:07.510]  But in a nutshell, why was it so important?
[01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:09.392]  Whoever wants to speak up first, go ahead.
[01:47:10.332 --> 01:47:12.814]  Maybe Stuart wasn't there, but Bruno was.
[01:47:12.834 --> 01:47:13.495]  I know Jeremy was.
[01:47:14.315 --> 01:47:16.796]  But you guys have been at many other events as well, confronting people.
[01:47:17.536 --> 01:47:18.516]  Why was this important?
[01:47:18.556 --> 01:47:19.536]  Who is General Myers?
[01:47:19.576 --> 01:47:20.317]  For people that don't know.
[01:47:20.337 --> 01:47:22.357]  This is Jeremy.
[01:47:22.397 --> 01:47:23.037]  Go for it, Jeremy.
[01:47:23.658 --> 01:47:27.319]  Thank you very much, Alex, for having us on, and I appreciate all the good work that you're doing.
[01:47:28.099 --> 01:47:37.822]  Richard Myers was the acting head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 9-11 while the real head was out of town, like many other important people on that day.
[01:47:38.522 --> 01:47:43.043]  And since that day, he's changed his story numerous times.
[01:47:43.556 --> 01:47:51.741]  About where he was when the building that he operates out of the Pentagon was hit.
[01:47:54.043 --> 01:48:00.226]  And he doesn't appear to desire to really clear his whole role in all of this up.
[01:48:00.567 --> 01:48:09.172]  He doesn't want to come really clean about all of these memetic war games and terror drills that were occurring at the same time that the terror attacks actually were pulled off.
[01:48:09.995 --> 01:48:15.096]  So at this point, at the very least, he's considered a suspect in the 9-11 blackout.
[01:48:15.196 --> 01:48:15.776]  I'll say it.
[01:48:15.916 --> 01:48:17.256]  No way he wasn't involved.
[01:48:17.597 --> 01:48:20.077]  He was in there making sure NORAD stood down.
[01:48:20.397 --> 01:48:21.077]  That's on record.
[01:48:21.257 --> 01:48:21.737]  I'll say it.
[01:48:21.777 --> 01:48:23.038]  General Myers is complicit.
[01:48:23.778 --> 01:48:24.378]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:48:24.418 --> 01:48:24.898]  One at a time.
[01:48:24.918 --> 01:48:28.699]  We got two folks talking and I'm getting a little bit of static on these lines.
[01:48:28.799 --> 01:48:30.279]  Who was jumping in there?
[01:48:35.765 --> 01:48:36.666]  Bruno, this is Bruno.
[01:48:36.746 --> 01:48:40.109]  I just want to agree that we need to call the criminals out for who they are.
[01:48:40.289 --> 01:48:44.592]  He's a 9-11 criminal, and that's how we labeled the video.
[01:48:44.893 --> 01:48:47.234]  You know, General Myers is a 9-11 criminal.
[01:48:48.055 --> 01:48:48.215]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.435 --> 01:48:51.678]  Who's got the crackly line there, or is somebody on the same line together?
[01:48:51.698 --> 01:48:54.841]  I'm not sure.
[01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:56.462]  That's Bruno's line.
[01:48:56.522 --> 01:48:57.843]  Bruno, I'm going to let you go in a moment.
[01:48:57.863 --> 01:49:03.868]  I want to have you guys back up for a full hour soon, because your line's bad, but we'll come back to the other two guys after the break.
[01:49:03.908 --> 01:49:04.649]  Bruno, are you still there?
[01:49:06.502 --> 01:49:09.164]  I was going to let him go after he finishes his point.
[01:49:09.184 --> 01:49:09.544]  Go ahead.
[01:49:11.986 --> 01:49:15.429]  You know, I think we need to call out all the criminals for who they are.
[01:49:15.549 --> 01:49:16.430]  Call them criminals.
[01:49:17.590 --> 01:49:20.152]  We've reached a threshold in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:49:20.633 --> 01:49:21.994]  People, it's growing quickly.
[01:49:22.014 --> 01:49:23.975]  These people are getting scared.
[01:49:23.995 --> 01:49:26.337]  Let's just call them what they are.
[01:49:26.377 --> 01:49:28.879]  They're treasonous, traitors, 9-11 criminals.
[01:49:28.899 --> 01:49:31.421]  Let's not be nice about it anymore.
[01:49:33.336 --> 01:49:35.197]  Yeah, there's no doubt they stood down, Norad.
[01:49:35.217 --> 01:49:38.760]  There's no doubt they ran the exact drills, the exact targets, being hit at the exact time.
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:40.501]  Bruno, you had a lot of courage.
[01:49:40.961 --> 01:49:44.744]  So did Jeremy and Stuart Howe as well, counting countless others confronting them.
[01:49:45.244 --> 01:49:50.507]  I mean, to go into this crowd and then these neocons assault you as you agree to leave.
[01:49:50.748 --> 01:49:55.631]  They hit you, punch you, and cuss at you, and hit you hard with pleasure and enjoyment.
[01:49:58.061 --> 01:50:11.686]  Yeah, it's sick, but we kind of knew that was going to happen when we went in, and it's just part of, you know, the intensity of the moment, it's so rewarding just to stand up and tell the truth.
[01:50:12.326 --> 01:50:17.668]  And I handed out Oath Keeper cards to many people, veterans in the audience, before I stood up.
[01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:26.351]  If people aren't aware of what Oath Keepers are, you should look it up, because police officers and military are responding really positively to that.
[01:50:27.545 --> 01:50:32.730]  Well, if I've ever seen spook and bad intelligence people, those were old retired spooks that were attacking you.
[01:50:34.231 --> 01:50:35.352]  And just shameful people.
[01:50:38.995 --> 01:50:39.796]  Stay there, gentlemen.
[01:50:39.816 --> 01:50:48.324]  I want to come back to you and briefly get into what happened while you were there and tell folks to go to the website w-a-c-l-a-dot-o-r-g.
[01:50:48.704 --> 01:50:51.226]  My site's at PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:51.827 --> 01:50:52.708]  I am Alex Jones.
[01:50:54.042 --> 01:50:58.547]  And I was there at the beginning of the 9-11 Truth Movement, and I pray to be there at the end when these criminals are brought to justice.
[01:50:59.147 --> 01:51:03.232]  Stay with us.
[01:51:04.293 --> 01:51:05.114]  Newsflash!
[01:51:05.134 --> 01:51:07.957]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[01:51:08.317 --> 01:51:12.342]  The dollar is plummeting, and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[01:51:13.759 --> 01:51:17.681]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[01:51:17.721 --> 01:51:21.963]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[01:51:22.364 --> 01:51:29.167]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy food.
[01:51:29.367 --> 01:51:37.451]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced price.
[01:51:37.692 --> 01:51:41.513]  So you and your family have a long-term food solution.
[01:51:42.994 --> 01:51:47.879]  The choice between starvation and freedom is made by you right now.
[01:51:47.959 --> 01:51:50.282]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[01:51:50.462 --> 01:51:52.744]  That's survivalistseeds.com.
[01:51:52.764 --> 01:51:55.507]  Because you are almost out of time.
[01:52:00.677 --> 01:52:02.018]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:52:02.198 --> 01:52:07.181]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[01:52:07.581 --> 01:52:09.663]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[01:52:10.003 --> 01:52:17.327]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling
[01:52:18.268 --> 01:52:18.869]  We're good to go.

[01:53:04.369 --> 01:53:06.990]  We're way beyond a question of if and when it's upon us.
[01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:11.972]  When you can't safely touch anything and a cough or sneeze can shut down your school or business.
[01:53:12.332 --> 01:53:19.455]  How would you or could you disinfect a school bus, office, locker room, place of worship or your entire home and do it in just minutes?

[01:53:36.512 --> 01:53:38.833]  And they do it for less cost than what you're currently using.
[01:53:39.433 --> 01:53:42.474]  Don't risk facing shipping bottlenecks and possible shortages.
[01:53:43.014 --> 01:53:48.296]  Act now to assure prompt delivery and to receive our two-for-one double product special.
[01:53:48.456 --> 01:53:49.937]  You can't buy Hazurid in stores.
[01:53:50.417 --> 01:53:53.198]  Order online at Hazurid.com or call 800-675-0323.
[01:53:53.258 --> 01:53:53.438]  That's 800-675-0323.
[01:54:11.094 --> 01:54:14.806]  Yeah, next week I'm gonna have the folks from We Are Change LA on for a full hour.
[01:54:14.826 --> 01:54:16.532]  I gotta get Luke on too from New York.
[01:54:16.552 --> 01:54:17.796]  Just all of them are so great.
[01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:25.171]  In closing, we let Bruno go because of his bad line.
[01:54:25.211 --> 01:54:28.052]  Bruno really got roughed up by these guys, but they were so cowardly.
[01:54:28.592 --> 01:54:31.112]  They're saying, get out, but they're trying to hold him there for the police.
[01:54:31.172 --> 01:54:31.573]  Get out!
[01:54:31.593 --> 01:54:36.994]  Then they hold you so they can get you for trespassing at a public event, or he actually bought a ticket for it, and then shoving him.
[01:54:37.514 --> 01:54:44.916]  Finishing up, Bruno is gone, but Jeremy and Stuart Howe, both very articulate, great research.
[01:54:44.956 --> 01:54:46.197]  I'm familiar with both of your work.
[01:54:46.537 --> 01:54:47.477]  Met Stuart a few times.
[01:54:48.117 --> 01:54:50.278]  Finish up with what happened in this event.
[01:54:51.513 --> 01:55:03.477]  So this is Jeremy and so Bruno stood up and called out General Richard Myers and asked him how we could trust him when he clearly contradicted his own stories around 9-11.
[01:55:04.197 --> 01:55:17.362]  And then quickly he was booed and a man who, a private individual, was the primary one to try to push him out as he tried to warn people about their freedoms being taken away.
[01:55:18.022 --> 01:55:21.123]  And then he was taken out and then a few moments later
[01:55:21.644 --> 01:55:30.489]  I couldn't handle it because they were applauding and they were apologizing to the alleged general for him having to deal with this.
[01:55:30.549 --> 01:55:34.591]  And so I couldn't take it, so I stood up and I said, that man was telling the truth.
[01:55:35.191 --> 01:55:36.532]  He has changed his story.
[01:55:36.612 --> 01:55:50.179]  And at that point, the same private individual came over and dragged me out into the aisle and then gave me a chokehold and pulled me out while I asked whether this was America and whether he was a patriot.
[01:55:51.142 --> 01:56:00.686]  And then when we finally got out, he said, he told me, there were children in there, like I, he was disturbed that I had made him do violence in front of the children.
[01:56:01.446 --> 01:56:03.947]  So it was, it was very, it was a very interesting sort of moment.
[01:56:03.967 --> 01:56:08.949]  No, that's always the mental illness of a tyrant, is to then say, you hurt children.
[01:56:09.489 --> 01:56:11.090]  Oh, I just took you to a FEMA camp.
[01:56:11.130 --> 01:56:12.331]  You made me do this.
[01:56:12.791 --> 01:56:13.851]  You're so bad.
[01:56:13.871 --> 01:56:15.792]  What a little punk, you know?
[01:56:17.335 --> 01:56:30.782]  What was great was that once we got outside, one lone, proud citizen came out and verified to the police that I had been choked and that many of the people in the audience had been clapping.
[01:56:31.862 --> 01:56:37.385]  And not that he agreed with my action, but he stood up for my right to take that action.
[01:56:38.326 --> 01:56:44.652]  So it's always the lone individual who stands up who becomes the bastion of freedom in the future.
[01:56:44.672 --> 01:56:53.380]  Now, the cops are going to take you to jail for daring to buy a ticket and then go in and ask a question at an event, and you were going to go to jail for being choked.
[01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:59.225]  That's how the twisted justice works now in this country, but people are standing up and saying no.
[01:57:00.498 --> 01:57:00.738]  Right.
[01:57:01.218 --> 01:57:11.424]  And I, we realized later that I didn't, I failed to give the direct command to the police officers to go in and apprehend the man saying that I wanted to press charges.
[01:57:11.584 --> 01:57:15.326]  You've got to tell him, you must, you know, I'm filing a complaint, I've been assaulted.
[01:57:16.086 --> 01:57:17.227]  You've got to tell him to go after him.
[01:57:17.467 --> 01:57:20.508]  Real fast, anything from Stewart about what's happening?
[01:57:22.049 --> 01:57:23.009]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:57:23.069 --> 01:57:27.852]  Yeah, you know, I was in the periphery on this one, but I'm just so proud of everybody in change.
[01:57:28.895 --> 01:57:32.878]  It's just we all have our opportunities to stand up when we can, how we can.
[01:57:32.898 --> 01:57:35.420]  The way you put it before we came on, I thought was great.
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:36.922]  You know, this is real.
[01:57:37.722 --> 01:57:43.947]  And we're just, we're genuine people doing our best because of the weight and the gravity of the importance of what's going on.
[01:57:44.067 --> 01:57:50.913]  So, you know, I'm just, like, thrilled about what's going on, not only with us out here, but across the country.
[01:57:50.933 --> 01:57:57.198]  You know, at every opportunity, people are standing up and saying the emperor wears no clothes, and we're just doing our best, man.
[01:57:58.362 --> 01:58:03.386]  And what it comes down to in the final equation is, you know you're good out there.
[01:58:03.486 --> 01:58:05.848]  You know, those of you listening, that you are a patriot.
[01:58:05.888 --> 01:58:06.929]  You're not New World Order.
[01:58:06.949 --> 01:58:08.950]  That, you know, that you have great ideas.
[01:58:09.230 --> 01:58:10.111]  Become leaders.
[01:58:10.171 --> 01:58:11.212]  Go to press conferences.
[01:58:11.332 --> 01:58:12.313]  Ask real questions.
[01:58:12.653 --> 01:58:13.514]  Start a blog.
[01:58:13.874 --> 01:58:14.835]  Get involved.
[01:58:15.555 --> 01:58:19.978]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is for good men and women to do nothing.
[01:58:20.379 --> 01:58:23.121]  Well, the website's W-A-C-L-A dot org.
[01:58:23.301 --> 01:58:24.982]  WACLA dot org.
[01:58:25.242 --> 01:58:26.543]  WeAreChangeLA dot org.
[01:58:27.344 --> 01:58:28.765]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:28.785 --> 01:58:34.308]  I want to have you guys all on for a full hour next week to break down all the great work you're doing and talk more.
[01:58:34.388 --> 01:58:35.148]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:58:35.989 --> 01:58:36.609]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:37.090 --> 01:58:37.390]  You bet.
[01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:38.891]  We'll be right back with Walter Williams.
[01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:39.391]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.313 --> 01:58:45.694]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.715 --> 01:58:47.756]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:56.127]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[01:58:56.427 --> 01:58:57.589]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:58:57.729 --> 01:59:01.714]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[01:59:02.014 --> 01:59:03.576]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:59:03.877 --> 01:59:08.723]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award.
[01:59:09.059 --> 01:59:09.559]  We're good to go.
[01:59:29.705 --> 01:59:31.887]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:59:32.107 --> 01:59:33.107]  And take it from me, folks.
[01:59:33.347 --> 01:59:34.388]  It really does taste great.
[01:59:34.588 --> 01:59:36.329]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:59:36.670 --> 01:59:42.153]  Go to www.enerfood.com.
[01:59:42.353 --> 01:59:46.836]  That's www.enerfood.com.
[01:59:47.016 --> 01:59:49.958]  Or just click on their banner on infowars.com for special pricing.
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:55.462]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.902 --> 01:59:58.684]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:10.810 --> 02:00:14.774]  Liberty vs. the Tyranny of Socialism is his new book.
[02:00:14.814 --> 02:00:15.855]  He's a best-selling author.
[02:00:16.235 --> 02:00:24.943]  You've heard him fill in for some of the biggest talk shows in the country, the biggest, Rush Limbaugh, and do his own show from time to time, WalterEWilliams.com.
[02:00:25.383 --> 02:00:30.348]  And I was telling him during the break when we first got him online that I like him a lot more than I like Rush Limbaugh.
[02:00:30.948 --> 02:00:42.336]  Because I like the fact that he's a professor, that he covers economics, and that he really exposes, when I hear him on air, the hypocrisy of the Republican Party, which needs to be done more and more.
[02:00:42.356 --> 02:00:45.598]  So for the next 30 minutes, Walter E. Williams joins us.
[02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:55.445]  We then go live to a press conference from the Texas Capitol, where they're openly trying to have the governor sign a bill where no more Fourth Amendment, the CPS will be able to take your children without even a fake order.
[02:00:55.846 --> 02:00:57.367]  Those are already flimsy from a judge.
[02:00:58.107 --> 02:01:00.630]  But a host of issues to talk about with Walter E. Williams today.
[02:01:00.970 --> 02:01:02.372]  Sir, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:01:02.492 --> 02:01:03.513]  Well, thank you, thank you.
[02:01:04.394 --> 02:01:05.655]  It's great to have you here with us.
[02:01:05.755 --> 02:01:09.619]  For those that may not know who you are, most probably do, tell us a little bit about yourself.
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:12.362]  Well, I'm a professor of economics.
[02:01:12.523 --> 02:01:17.848]  I've been teaching at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia for going on 30 years.
[02:01:19.236 --> 02:01:30.040]  And my big job is trying to convince my fellow Americans on the moral superiority of individual liberty and its main ingredient, limited government.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:30.880]  It's a hard job.
[02:01:32.301 --> 02:01:33.621]  What do you think of Ron Paul?
[02:01:34.722 --> 02:01:37.103]  I think he's a great guy.
[02:01:37.263 --> 02:01:45.946]  I think he's one of the few, and perhaps you can only name five, four or five congressmen, that if the founders were to come back, they would speak to.
[02:01:45.986 --> 02:01:48.187]  He's one of the few that they would have respect for.
[02:01:49.724 --> 02:01:52.765]  So you think he's founding Father Caliber, or they would just talk to him?
[02:01:53.726 --> 02:01:57.868]  Well, I think they would talk to him.
[02:01:58.348 --> 02:02:09.193]  Most congressmen, they have utter contempt for the Constitution of the United States and the moral principles that were the bedrock at our founding.
[02:02:09.853 --> 02:02:13.635]  And when I say that, a lot of people say, well, what are you talking about?
[02:02:13.675 --> 02:02:16.236]  Well, if you read through the Constitution,
[02:02:17.999 --> 02:02:27.504]  The founders gave the Congress 21 things to do, and it's listed in Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, and if it's not there, they can't do it.
[02:02:27.964 --> 02:02:46.053]  And to give you an idea of how far we've strayed, James Madison, who is the acknowledged father of the Constitution, he said in 1794, when Congress appropriated $15,000 to help some French refugees, he said, and I'm virtually quoting him, and all these quotes are available on my website at waltdwilliams.com,
[02:02:47.622 --> 02:02:59.325]  He says, I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article in the Constitution that allows Congress to take the money of their constituents for the purposes of benevolence.
[02:03:00.085 --> 02:03:06.987]  Now, if you look at the federal budget today, two-thirds or three-quarters of it is for the purpose of benevolence.
[02:03:07.027 --> 02:03:15.409]  That is, the major function of the United States Congress today is that of taking the rightful property of one American
[02:03:16.138 --> 02:03:19.280]  And giving it to another American to whom it does not belong.
[02:03:20.001 --> 02:03:30.908]  Now I'm talking about farm subsidies, business bailouts, food stamps, welfare, prescription drugs, you just name it, on and on.
[02:03:31.608 --> 02:03:35.110]  Congress is engaged in what, if you and I did it, we'd go to jail.
[02:03:35.150 --> 02:03:38.232]  That is taking the property of one person and giving it to another.
[02:03:38.873 --> 02:03:40.434]  It's nothing more than legalized theft.
[02:03:41.138 --> 02:03:46.582]  And now it becomes more and more obvious with government just running wild at every level.
[02:03:46.642 --> 02:03:51.006]  Isn't the government just becoming a gang with a flag, with a bunch of enforcers?
[02:03:52.907 --> 02:03:57.371]  They're becoming Congress and the White House, and they've been this way for a long time.
[02:03:57.471 --> 02:03:59.012]  It's just escalated recently.
[02:03:59.032 --> 02:04:01.154]  They're just a group of thugs.
[02:04:04.428 --> 02:04:05.649]  Well, there's no doubt of that.
[02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:09.831]  I mean, we see all these reports where Congress is exempt from most of the laws they pass on us.
[02:04:10.212 --> 02:04:11.853]  Isn't that one of the hallmarks of tyranny?
[02:04:12.888 --> 02:04:15.049]  That is absolutely right.
[02:04:15.149 --> 02:04:28.997]  When people talk about rule of law and equality for the law, it means that the same rules, the same laws that you and I must obey also apply to people in government.
[02:04:29.017 --> 02:04:30.537]  They must also obey them.
[02:04:30.597 --> 02:04:35.260]  That is, if something is immoral for you and I to do, it's immoral for government to do.
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:37.381]  Amazing.
[02:04:37.401 --> 02:04:39.663]  We've got 25 minutes left with him after this break.
[02:04:39.703 --> 02:04:40.984]  He's Walter E. Williams.
[02:04:41.585 --> 02:04:43.306]  And the website is WalterEWilliams.com.
[02:04:43.327 --> 02:04:44.007]  Can't forget that.
[02:04:44.488 --> 02:04:46.089]  We have links to it up on our websites.
[02:04:46.730 --> 02:04:49.012]  Just absolutely great to have him on.
[02:04:49.032 --> 02:04:54.277]  I remember listening to him when I was in college, way back in the early 1990s.
[02:04:54.317 --> 02:04:56.019]  Just great to have him on with us.
[02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:58.221]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:04:58.241 --> 02:04:58.622]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.711 --> 02:05:05.692]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:05:05.912 --> 02:05:09.693]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.933 --> 02:05:15.535]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.835 --> 02:05:16.275]  It's true.
[02:05:16.475 --> 02:05:20.696]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.896 --> 02:05:27.258]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:05:27.438 --> 02:05:27.878]  Number four,
[02:05:28.098 --> 02:05:30.761]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:05:31.002 --> 02:05:34.265]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:34.285 --> 02:05:38.410]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.556 --> 02:05:44.857]  A long time sponsor of ours.

[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:02.242]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.362 --> 02:06:07.027]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:06:07.107 --> 02:06:09.870]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:06:10.070 --> 02:06:12.933]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:06:13.113 --> 02:06:17.838]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:06:18.058 --> 02:06:18.999]  If you simply prepare.
[02:06:19.179 --> 02:06:22.142]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:06:22.422 --> 02:06:29.328]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:06:29.408 --> 02:06:32.551]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[02:06:49.743 --> 02:06:51.104]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:02.142]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:07:02.322 --> 02:07:03.784]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:07:04.064 --> 02:07:06.307]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:07:06.747 --> 02:07:11.493]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:07:11.893 --> 02:07:14.737]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:07:15.097 --> 02:07:18.541]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[02:07:18.979 --> 02:07:30.966]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[02:07:31.526 --> 02:07:33.528]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[02:07:33.548 --> 02:07:34.848]  I use one every day.
[02:07:35.249 --> 02:07:37.710]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[02:07:38.010 --> 02:07:40.491]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:11.462 --> 02:08:21.745]  Well, he is a professor of economics, best-selling author, nationally syndicated radio talk show host in his part-time, and a syndicated columnist.
[02:08:21.785 --> 02:08:26.127]  Walterewilliams.com, his latest column out today is Americans Love Government.
[02:08:26.806 --> 02:08:39.729]  But I was making the point during the break to him, isn't that because we've been domesticated, brought up in it, not knowing how good it is without this giant government, and people don't know that in every case in history, government grows till it destroys the society.
[02:08:40.009 --> 02:08:41.230]  Can you speak to that, sir?
[02:08:41.250 --> 02:08:41.870]  Yes, I can.
[02:08:42.210 --> 02:08:46.451]  That is, if you look at the federal government now as a percentage of our GDP,
[02:08:47.931 --> 02:09:01.341]  The federal government spends something like 22% of our GDP, and state and local governments spend up to, I think the total amount goes to near 40% of the GDP is spent by government in our country.
[02:09:01.821 --> 02:09:10.428]  Now, from 1787, the inception of our nation, from 1787 until the 1920s, the federal government spent only 3% of the GDP, except during wartime,
[02:09:17.239 --> 02:09:30.856]  And the state and local government spent around 9% of the GDP, and so making for a total of 12% of the GDP, as opposed to close to 40%, was being spent by government.
[02:09:31.216 --> 02:09:33.940]  And keep in mind that in 1787, we were a third world nation.
[02:09:36.209 --> 02:09:42.798]  And by 1920, we were the most powerful nation on the face of Earth, and we were rich.
[02:09:43.038 --> 02:09:47.524]  That is, we went through this whole interval without a big government.
[02:09:48.783 --> 02:10:04.054]  And it turns out something else that's significant that Americans just plain don't know is that the idea that Congress and the White House should be involved with the economy, stimulating the economy, New Deal, this is a new idea.
[02:10:04.114 --> 02:10:12.660]  That is, we've had recessions and depressions that went from one year to seven years throughout our whole history.
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:18.104]  As a matter of fact, in 1920 there was a sharp, very, very sharp downturn in the economy.
[02:10:18.624 --> 02:10:22.486]  There was no government program, and we went off after that.
[02:10:22.526 --> 02:10:25.288]  In 1922, we went through the Roaring Twenties.
[02:10:25.668 --> 02:10:28.129]  In the 1790s, there was a Great Depression.
[02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:33.692]  As a matter of fact, it was, I think, like seven years, and there was no government program.
[02:10:34.013 --> 02:10:39.776]  Now, the government programs that deal with recessions came when there was a sharp turndown in the economy in 1929-1930.
[02:10:42.297 --> 02:10:50.201]  And the Hoover administration started the government programs, and Roosevelt just followed on with it with the New Deal.
[02:10:50.862 --> 02:11:03.648]  And what they did, they turned what would have been in 1930, what would have been at the maximum, a three-year sharp downturn in the economy, they turned it into a 16-year affair.
[02:11:03.708 --> 02:11:05.949]  That is, the Great Depression was not over until 1946.
[02:11:07.409 --> 02:11:16.513]  And Japan has now 12, 13 years doing the same thing, and I'm studying those panics, as they called them, and those depressions.
[02:11:17.114 --> 02:11:28.699]  They were much shorter, they were much more localized back before the Federal Reserve, back before government got involved, back before private interest got involved with government in this unholy alliance.
[02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:33.302]  And they promised, we'll never have another run on the bank, we'll never have another recession or depression.
[02:11:33.982 --> 02:11:42.869]  And then, 1913 to 1929, they then take that depression and just exacerbate it with all the price controls and the rest of it.
[02:11:42.909 --> 02:11:43.649]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:11:44.370 --> 02:11:45.511]  And you're right, Martin.
[02:11:45.831 --> 02:11:51.155]  The current set of problems that we face now is a direct result of Congress.
[02:11:51.415 --> 02:12:01.503]  I always suggest to people that the fundamentals of the American economy are, even now, still reasonably sound.
[02:12:01.983 --> 02:12:04.805]  We have this huge problem in the financial sector.
[02:12:04.845 --> 02:12:09.489]  The financial sector is a big problem, and it's affecting some other parts of the economy.
[02:12:09.890 --> 02:12:21.259]  But Congress is the cause of the problems in the financial sector, particularly those that stem from the subprime loans and the housing market.
[02:12:21.579 --> 02:12:28.445]  It's been enabling it and demanding it and prodding it all along, and then now is enabling it further.
[02:12:28.465 --> 02:12:32.588]  $14.8 trillion in seven months, Bloomberg reported.
[02:12:32.608 --> 02:12:35.951]  I mean, my God, that's more than the GDP in seven months.
[02:12:36.212 --> 02:12:36.652]  That's right.
[02:12:36.892 --> 02:12:42.357]  And the American people, I don't know what to say about my fellow Americans.
[02:12:42.797 --> 02:12:48.521]  But they're asking Congress to come and help us out, to change things.
[02:12:48.801 --> 02:12:59.469]  That is, to ask Congress to help us, that's very much like seeing a building on fire and you calling the arsons who set it on fire to help you put it out.
[02:13:00.089 --> 02:13:00.970]  That's the same thing.
[02:13:02.130 --> 02:13:04.612]  And Congress is the cause of the problem.
[02:13:04.992 --> 02:13:11.677]  And you know what gets me about the, I call it, stupidity of Americans, or either the ignorance of Americans, is that
[02:13:12.432 --> 02:13:14.633]  Well, it's unbelievable.
[02:13:15.353 --> 02:13:16.673]  Bloomberg reported that nine
[02:13:32.694 --> 02:13:35.557]  Point three trillion would pay off all the mortgages in the country.
[02:13:36.038 --> 02:13:40.983]  So if it's 14.8 so far, where is all the money going?
[02:13:42.385 --> 02:13:43.346]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:13:43.406 --> 02:13:48.091]  And they're admitting now that it's driven up mortgage prices because the banks have got all this money.
[02:13:48.351 --> 02:13:50.594]  They're just wanting to hoard it or to buy up other banks.
[02:13:50.894 --> 02:14:05.571]  Oh, that's right, and see what Congress should do, what should happen is that people who got in over their heads in the housing market, they bought houses they cannot afford, they should just lose their house and they should be foreclosed on.
[02:14:05.891 --> 02:14:08.935]  That is, if you, you know, I think it was Herbert Spencer said,
[02:14:09.956 --> 02:14:10.696]  I believe it was him.
[02:14:10.756 --> 02:14:11.917]  It could have been somebody else.
[02:14:12.518 --> 02:14:17.823]  If you protect people from the folly of their ways, you create a nation of fools.
[02:14:18.163 --> 02:14:18.964]  And that's what we're doing.
[02:14:18.984 --> 02:14:23.588]  We're protecting people from their folly and therefore creating a nation of fools.
[02:14:24.248 --> 02:14:32.696]  And see, the problem is that too many of us want to blame politicians for our problems.
[02:14:32.936 --> 02:14:36.359]  And yes, we can blame politicians just a little bit.
[02:14:37.153 --> 02:14:40.695]  But the bulk of the blame lies with the American people.
[02:14:41.035 --> 02:14:46.797]  That is because politicians are doing precisely what American people elect them to office to do.
[02:14:47.337 --> 02:14:49.558]  And what do we elect them to office to do?
[02:14:49.979 --> 02:14:52.800]  We elect them to office to use the power of their office
[02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:57.263]  To take the property of one American and give it to us.
[02:14:57.723 --> 02:14:58.644]  Now, let's shift gears.
[02:14:58.684 --> 02:15:01.726]  Let's shift gears, sir, into Barack Obama.
[02:15:01.826 --> 02:15:04.308]  Clearly, George Bush's size of government triples.
[02:15:04.789 --> 02:15:05.889]  I thought that was bad.
[02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:10.593]  Now, under Obama, he's doubling the government in one year.
[02:15:11.133 --> 02:15:18.499]  If you project that out ten times by the time he leaves office, or even more so specifically, sir,
[02:15:20.243 --> 02:15:23.424]  I don't know whether that's sustainable, but surely that's what he's doing.
[02:15:23.524 --> 02:15:25.024]  And that's what the American people want.
[02:15:25.924 --> 02:15:26.845]  That's what they want.
[02:15:26.885 --> 02:15:31.645]  Look, if you doubt what I'm saying, what the American people want, let me ask you a question.
[02:15:32.026 --> 02:15:37.687]  Now, suppose I, Walter Williams, was running for the United States Senate from Texas.
[02:15:38.687 --> 02:15:46.368]  And I go back and forth across the state of Texas, telling my fellow Texans, look, I've read the United States Constitution.
[02:15:46.869 --> 02:15:49.089]  I know what Congress is authorized to do.
[02:15:49.901 --> 02:16:00.910]  And if you elect me to the Senate, don't expect for me to bring back aid to higher education funds, highway construction funds, prescription drugs, Meals on Wheels.
[02:16:01.291 --> 02:16:05.554]  Do you think I would get elected to the Senate from Texas?
[02:16:06.015 --> 02:16:14.542]  No, because, maybe in Texas, but in other states, no, because they don't understand the feds take a dollar of our money, send 30 cents back with strings attached.
[02:16:15.242 --> 02:16:17.084]  But you know, see, here's the problem, Alex.
[02:16:18.138 --> 02:16:28.341]  Is that the people of Texas would be absolutely right not electing anybody who respects the United States Constitution to the United States Senate.
[02:16:28.662 --> 02:16:38.645]  The reason why is that, for example, if I am the Senator, and if I don't bring back billions of dollars to Texans, that doesn't mean that Texans will pay a lower federal income tax.
[02:16:38.705 --> 02:16:39.205]  Exactly.
[02:16:39.285 --> 02:16:42.166]  All that it means is that Oklahoma will get it instead.
[02:16:42.186 --> 02:16:47.468]  That is, once legalized theft begins, it's safe for everybody to participate.
[02:16:48.121 --> 02:16:49.062]  Oh, that's a great point.
[02:16:49.102 --> 02:16:49.842]  I hadn't thought of that.
[02:16:50.302 --> 02:16:51.723]  That's what Ron Paul's always saying.
[02:16:51.983 --> 02:17:02.530]  They say he's a hypocrite because he votes against the bills, the spending bills, but once the money comes in, he says, look, I'm going to earmark this because the money was spent.
[02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:04.551]  I mean, now you're paying these taxes.
[02:17:04.611 --> 02:17:09.314]  You don't want it to come back for the shrimp fisheries of the Gulf Coast.
[02:17:09.614 --> 02:17:11.135]  I mean, I represent the Gulf Coast.
[02:17:11.595 --> 02:17:15.958]  And so if I don't take this earmark, it's going to go to foreign aid or something.
[02:17:16.619 --> 02:17:19.322]  That is absolutely right.
[02:17:19.442 --> 02:17:24.609]  It makes people who would otherwise be moral, they become immoral.
[02:17:24.829 --> 02:17:33.440]  Because if you don't participate in the legalized theft, you're going to wind up holding the brown end of the stick, if you get what I mean.
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:33.680]  Wow.
[02:17:36.201 --> 02:17:36.662]  Amazing.
[02:17:37.102 --> 02:17:38.764]  Sir, you've been around a while.
[02:17:38.865 --> 02:17:40.787]  You've made a lot of predictions I've seen come true.
[02:17:41.748 --> 02:17:44.592]  What do you see happening with Obama with this false hope?
[02:17:45.153 --> 02:17:46.955]  He knows government health care isn't going to work.
[02:17:47.015 --> 02:17:51.461]  He knows trillions spent is just going to, down the road, make things even worse.
[02:17:53.183 --> 02:18:03.986]  I mean, I guess the special interests want all this money, and they're the ones that put him in office, but how do you see this ending with Barack Obama and all these people that followed him and believe he's really gonna give him a free house, give him a free car?
[02:18:04.046 --> 02:18:08.148]  You know, the people you see on TV saying, all my problems are solved because of Obama.
[02:18:09.949 --> 02:18:19.154]  You know, I don't know what to predict, but however, the current state of affairs is unsustainable.
[02:18:19.554 --> 02:18:24.677]  I mean, just one aspect, forget about the healthcare and all this other spending.
[02:18:25.342 --> 02:18:34.569]  It turns out that the unfunded liability of Social Security and Medicare is a hundred and one trillion dollars.
[02:18:35.049 --> 02:18:45.737]  Now, what that means, when I say unfunded liability, and even the Social Security Administration's report, they say it's the unfunded liability that's huge, 101 trillion dollars.
[02:18:46.498 --> 02:18:49.200]  What that means is that in order for Congress
[02:18:50.009 --> 02:19:01.964]  To make good on the promises it's already made to people who are living today, in terms of Medicare and Social Security, they would have to put trillions of dollars in the bank today.
[02:19:02.967 --> 02:19:07.269]  Earning at least a 6% rate of interest in order to make good for it.
[02:19:07.529 --> 02:19:09.570]  And they're not going to do that.
[02:19:10.371 --> 02:19:32.021]  And according to some estimates, such as the National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas, Texas, they point out that by 2040, I believe something like, you know, given the current state of affairs, if it continues the way it's going now, that 80% of the federal budget will be spent on Social Security and Medicare.
[02:19:35.501 --> 02:19:36.041]  Amazing.
[02:19:36.662 --> 02:19:37.402]  Eighty percent.
[02:19:37.422 --> 02:19:40.204]  Let's talk more about that in our final segment with Walter E. Williams.
[02:19:40.224 --> 02:19:41.445]  Walterewilliams.com.
[02:19:42.065 --> 02:19:43.186]  He is our guest.
[02:19:43.266 --> 02:19:44.987]  I hope he'll come back again with us soon.
[02:19:45.668 --> 02:19:47.369]  I want to talk to him about GM.
[02:19:47.769 --> 02:19:58.736]  Not only is there a bailout of GM, but the bailout money under World Trade Organization rules, part of it has to go overseas, so we're paying to ship it to China and Brazil and Europe.
[02:19:59.176 --> 02:19:59.617]  Stay with us.

[02:21:00.546 --> 02:21:00.986]  Gold.
[02:21:01.327 --> 02:21:02.628]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:21:02.888 --> 02:21:08.972]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:21:09.152 --> 02:21:12.975]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:21:13.335 --> 02:21:15.217]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:21:15.277 --> 02:21:17.578]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:21:17.698 --> 02:21:18.439]  The stage is being
[02:21:18.439 --> 02:21:19.300]  We're good to go.
[02:21:40.572 --> 02:21:46.193]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.

[02:22:00.657 --> 02:22:05.878]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:06.676 --> 02:22:12.041]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:22:12.561 --> 02:22:18.767]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:19.047 --> 02:22:20.888]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:21.048 --> 02:22:23.431]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:23.511 --> 02:22:34.380]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:22:36.684 --> 02:22:37.925]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:38.346 --> 02:22:39.727]  It's about a one world government.
[02:22:40.208 --> 02:22:46.514]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:22:55.384 --> 02:22:56.545]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:56.966 --> 02:22:58.127]  The people strike back.
[02:22:59.798 --> 02:23:03.621]  Are you concerned about the current strain of influenza spreading across the U.S.?
[02:23:03.921 --> 02:23:09.125]  At the rate this new virus is spreading, it's not a matter of if, but when it will affect each and every American.
[02:23:09.365 --> 02:23:17.611]  This virus is comprised of extracted DNA from the Spanish flu and has combined itself with the bird and swine flu, making it very contagious and deadly.
[02:23:17.812 --> 02:23:23.076]  The Center for Disease Control has made it clear that there are no vaccinations available to treat this new threat.
[02:23:23.316 --> 02:23:25.377]  What can you do to help protect your family?

[02:24:06.539 --> 02:24:08.880]  Walter E. Williams is our guest.
[02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:11.462]  We had a bizarre power outage here in the studio.
[02:24:11.482 --> 02:24:12.582]  We're on backup.
[02:24:12.822 --> 02:24:14.783]  We'll see if we can stay on the air here together.
[02:24:15.104 --> 02:24:16.184]  Mr. Williams continuing.
[02:24:16.284 --> 02:24:22.908]  GM, the trillions of the banks, and the government's now saying they're just going to expand and intensify all of this.
[02:24:23.408 --> 02:24:29.091]  Are they going to just continue to dump money on this until they completely destroy us, or how do you see this unfolding?
[02:24:29.932 --> 02:24:31.353]  Well, I don't know.
[02:24:31.373 --> 02:24:45.501]  I think a lot of things that they're doing is unsustainable, but I think that their whole idea about Detroit and GM and other companies going bankrupt, I think that people don't quite understand what bankruptcy means.
[02:24:45.561 --> 02:24:49.403]  If they did, I don't think they would let government get away with what they're doing.
[02:24:49.443 --> 02:24:54.146]  That is, it's almost when you hear people talk, you know, when the airline goes bankrupt,
