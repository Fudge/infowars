[00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.270]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.731]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.411]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:16.792]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:21.313]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.230]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, Monday, December 21st, 2009.
[00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:44.293]  Another transmission as we wage war on corruption and crash through the lies and disinformation.
[00:00:45.593 --> 00:00:47.754]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:49.073 --> 00:01:07.963]  Coming up later in the broadcast, Michael Braverman, the producer of Jesse Ventura's number one television show on TruTV, Conspiracy Theory, will be joining us to talk about this week's episode, Big Brother, with Kathryn Albrecht and others.
[00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:15.486]  I of course am a consultant on the television show and a frequent guest as well.
[00:01:15.707 --> 00:01:29.316]  We're going to talk about the incredible global warming special last week and the special that I am particularly consulted on and appear in more than any other episode coming up next week, Secret Societies.
[00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:37.681]  Now we can't get Ventura on obviously because he doesn't have a telephone in the rural area of Mexico where he lives during the winter.
[00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:38.242]  He's now
[00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:43.444]  At least gotten on his way down to Mexico in his RV.
[00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:48.005]  So Michael Braverman with his maiden voyage with us coming up.
[00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:58.869]  And we've got James Dillingpole coming on the radio show, a London Telegraph writer who has really been exposing the global warming fraud.
[00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.911]  We'll look at Copenhagen now in its aftermath.
[00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:05.952]  We'll also have wide open phones.
[00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:14.097]  Coming up later in the broadcast today, but we are live Monday the 21st day of December 2009.
[00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:15.778]  Now, Paul Watson wrote a story.
[00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:31.236]  So did Aaron Dykes via my analysis on Friday.
[00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:38.082]  Headline, Alex Jones, Copenhagen births world government framework despite fallout over science fraud.
[00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:43.747]  And a lot of people said, but the media says it completely failed.
[00:02:43.987 --> 00:02:45.308]  And it did largely fail.
[00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.734]  But the dictators that run the EU and the UN and our country and England
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.706]  Gordon Brown namely, being the kingpin, said, we don't care, we're implementing this regardless.
[00:02:59.327 --> 00:03:02.050]  And now Gordon Brown has given speeches saying just that.
[00:03:03.171 --> 00:03:10.420]  And we have the news headlines here, London Telegraph, there'll be nowhere to run from the New World Government.
[00:03:14.707 --> 00:03:18.732]  That is just some of the news that I have on this front.
[00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:20.193]  Here's another headline.
[00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:24.838]  Spy drones to enforce CO2 regulations.
[00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.380]  Oh, you thought there wasn't an agreement?
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.065]  Obama has now announced under the structure of global governance the Pentagon will monitor
[00:03:31.886 --> 00:03:33.227]  Your carbon emissions.
[00:03:33.247 --> 00:03:34.288]  That already goes on.
[00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:40.973]  They have Cessnas all over the United States that fly around registering and reading the carbon emissions from power plants, namely.
[00:03:41.894 --> 00:03:44.956]  Also, President Obama and a New World Order.
[00:03:45.437 --> 00:03:47.038]  The Wall Street Journal.
[00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:49.019]  Here's another one.
[00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:52.382]  Copenhagen Climate Summit.
[00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:55.985]  Plan for EU to police countries' emissions globally.
[00:03:57.844 --> 00:03:59.465]  Here's another one, Washington Post.
[00:03:59.845 --> 00:04:06.248]  Copenhagen climate deal shows new world order may be led by US-China.
[00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.870]  Here's another Wall Street Journal headline.
[00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.631]  In the new world order, sterling should suffer.
[00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:17.754]  Talking about the pound, the British currency.
[00:04:18.434 --> 00:04:22.556]  So that is just some of what is coming up today.
[00:04:24.758 --> 00:04:27.219]  Also, you know the bad news.
[00:04:29.963 --> 00:04:32.565]  You know the bad news.
[00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:45.596]  Early this morning, the Senate passed the unconstitutional, draconian, authoritarian health care grab.
[00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:47.818]  The eugenics health care grab.
[00:04:47.838 --> 00:04:52.522]  And now it moves on to conference and it's pretty much assured of passage.
[00:04:53.462 --> 00:04:57.586]  Barring a miracle in that House committee that already passed their version.
[00:04:58.086 --> 00:04:58.787]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:03.469]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:08.831]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.192 --> 00:05:10.932]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.232 --> 00:05:16.055]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.235 --> 00:05:17.195]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:18.175]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:20.136]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:21.257]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.497 --> 00:05:23.558]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.718 --> 00:05:24.818]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.359]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:31.645]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:35.029]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.934]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.254 --> 00:05:40.235]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.475 --> 00:05:41.076]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.377 --> 00:05:42.298]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.478 --> 00:05:43.239]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.220]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.264]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:05:49.787 --> 00:05:50.749]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:59.821 --> 00:06:03.804]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:06:03.924 --> 00:06:06.667]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:06:06.787 --> 00:06:08.048]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:08.748]  It's very real.
[00:06:08.888 --> 00:06:11.030]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.651]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:06:59.617 --> 00:07:04.783]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:07:04.923 --> 00:07:06.845]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:09.288]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:07:09.448 --> 00:07:11.290]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:13.072]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:07:13.353 --> 00:07:14.394]  There is a solution.
[00:07:14.614 --> 00:07:22.617]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:07:59.328 --> 00:08:00.168]  Holiday season.
[00:08:01.808 --> 00:08:04.009]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:07.290]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:18.701]  In the last month we've spent a lot of time on health care.
[00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:50.319]  But once the House passed it and the Senate said they had the 60 votes, there really isn't much we can do other than have the states block it and have lawsuits filed in the state and federal courts because this system is unconstitutional.
[00:08:50.459 --> 00:08:56.322]  It is government crony capitalism.
[00:08:58.723 --> 00:09:03.106]  And we're going to be breaking that down quite a bit later in the broadcast today.
[00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:23.342]  I still want to mainly focus on Copenhagen in the first hour and a little bit into the second hour, because as big as the power grab of healthcare is, it is nothing compared to global governance being openly established.
[00:09:23.382 --> 00:09:24.902]  Now, here's the good news.
[00:09:24.942 --> 00:09:26.863]  We're making the tyrants act like tyrants.
[00:09:28.063 --> 00:09:33.005]  In the two-week meeting, they were unable to get the majority of nations to sign on.
[00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.391]  Third world, second world, and developing nations.
[00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:55.718]  The problem is the private IMF and World Bank front companies for the private central banks fully and illegitimately and illegally have seized control in the last 100 years of Europe, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in the last 50.
[00:09:58.119 --> 00:10:01.761]  And they have announced, and Gordon Brown is honchoing the deal,
[00:10:03.208 --> 00:10:06.351]  That they don't care if the agreement wasn't signed on to.
[00:10:07.132 --> 00:10:17.123]  They are going to implement the taxes in the United States, in Canada, in England, in Western Europe, in Japan, in Australia, and New Zealand.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:18.941]  They don't care.
[00:10:19.781 --> 00:10:20.682]  It will be implemented.
[00:10:21.043 --> 00:10:34.895]  That's why we call it the Anglo-American Establishment, because one of their top strategists, Professor Carol Quigley, the head of the Georgetown Political Science Department, Bill Clinton's main mentor, wrote two books.
[00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:41.522]  One, the Anglo-American Establishment, that was widely publicized, and the other, written specifically for the State Department,
[00:10:42.281 --> 00:10:46.132]  But it got out to the public, 900 pages titled, Tragedy and Hope.
[00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:50.464]  And he explained that it isn't the British Empire that rules the planet.
[00:10:51.579 --> 00:11:12.396]  It is the skeletal structure left over by the British Empire and their governing system, their shadow government imperial system that they use in India and in many other nations, that that structure, that system is what is being used to carry out the global governance.
[00:11:14.656 --> 00:11:17.438]  So it is that system that is being used.
[00:11:17.478 --> 00:11:29.306]  That system that Cecil Rhodes, when he died, gave over four billion dollars and that was in the numbers of close to a hundred years ago.
[00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:31.307]  So the equivalent of trillions.
[00:11:32.088 --> 00:11:41.494]  He gave all of his money to the establishment of global governance and he wrote books how they were going to establish global governance through the British Empire model.
[00:11:42.648 --> 00:12:00.979]  And so the British Empire and the Royals of England are some of the biggest owners of the system and it's a global consortium of corporations that now own the planet through fraud, through chicanery, through larceny, through their
[00:12:02.133 --> 00:12:27.709]  criminal activity through private corporate intelligence agencies governmental intelligence agencies that take their orders from private networks the private networks through global privatization are not really privatizing government the private corporations are becoming government with their mercenaries with their corporate spies and so we have had a global government
[00:12:28.797 --> 00:12:31.198]  At least since the 1950s.
[00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:33.719]  But it wasn't complete, it wasn't total.
[00:12:34.499 --> 00:12:57.749]  And so the globalists have been lobbying the states and other units of federal systems worldwide to standardize zoning, to standardize police, to standardize and raise the taxing system through the model of the OECD, the Organization of Economic and Cooperative Development, that was set up to reorganize Europe after the Marshall Plan, via the Marshall Plan.
[00:12:59.491 --> 00:13:07.435]  And it's an emergency receivership system that comes into nations, they destroy, they bankrupt, by design, and then the globalists take over.
[00:13:08.896 --> 00:13:17.281]  And so what's happened is, the global government is already in place, they just tried to, through the hype of man-made global warming,
[00:13:18.223 --> 00:13:21.746]  And now climate change, because the Earth is cooling, so they've shifted terms again.
[00:13:21.807 --> 00:13:23.468]  First global freezing, then global warming.
[00:13:23.849 --> 00:13:28.373]  Global freezing in the 70s, global warming in the 80s and 90s, early 2000s.
[00:13:29.054 --> 00:13:36.040]  Now, in the late 2000s, they are shifting into climate change itself.
[00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:39.304]  That way they can never get pinned down again if it gets hotter or colder.
[00:13:40.154 --> 00:13:43.175]  So all of that is now happening.
[00:13:43.195 --> 00:13:45.115]  So that's in place, but it's fraudulent.
[00:13:45.535 --> 00:13:59.659]  They need to get the legislatures and the governments of the world, who are already predominantly dominated by these banking interests, to openly, on paper, through treaties, sign over what's left of their sovereignty.
[00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:01.079]  That failed.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.741]  So they are simply announcing publicly the structure that was already there.
[00:14:07.731 --> 00:14:16.335]  The agreement that was signed on to was signed on to by the US, Europe, England, and just a few other countries on Friday evening into Saturday morning.
[00:14:17.956 --> 00:14:19.376]  That agreement is now public.
[00:14:20.677 --> 00:14:23.138]  I did a video announcement on Friday about it.
[00:14:23.158 --> 00:14:25.359]  We wrote stories Friday, Saturday, and Sunday on it.
[00:14:25.859 --> 00:14:34.723]  On Sunday, scores of mainstream newspapers, The Wall Street Journal, The London Telegraph, and others reported exactly what we told you on Friday.
[00:14:38.641 --> 00:15:03.731]  that Gordon Brown is writing the agreement because a blank check was signed on to by Europe and the United States and England Canada and a few other nations that they would give unlimited taxing power to a private banking board established through the World Bank and IMF and now Gordon Brown
[00:15:04.631 --> 00:15:08.333]  He is openly on television announcing that he is the leader of it.
[00:15:08.653 --> 00:15:13.855]  He set up the G20 as well, back when he was the underling of Tony Blair.
[00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:17.116]  He is one of the most powerful people in the world, Gordon Brown.
[00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:25.180]  And he is openly announcing that the West will levy taxes against its people.
[00:15:26.334 --> 00:15:54.659]  As if the banker bailout takeover wasn't bad enough, and the planned implosion of the economy for vertical consolidation integration, as if that wasn't bad enough that they will now levy unilaterally taxes to be paid to the IMF and World Bank, and that the EU will now go into all the third world nations and will chronicle their industrial development, and that if they don't unilaterally themselves as well,
[00:15:56.707 --> 00:16:04.810]  Their carbon emissions, which is a death sentence for tens of millions a year, conservatively... I had said hundreds of millions were at starvation level.
[00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:05.110]  The U.N.
[00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.812]  actually says 900 million are on starvation level every year.
[00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:10.173]  Over 15 million starve to death a year.
[00:16:10.193 --> 00:16:13.174]  This will conservatively increase it by more than 10 million a year.
[00:16:13.454 --> 00:16:14.855]  We're talking about mega-death.
[00:16:15.895 --> 00:16:16.475]  Mega-death.
[00:16:16.695 --> 00:16:18.196]  Deaths in the millions.
[00:16:21.866 --> 00:16:32.375]  And they are announcing that if those nations don't make cuts, the IMF and World Bank that have already bought them off, paid them off, they give Nigeria, again, a good example, a billion dollar loan.
[00:16:32.395 --> 00:16:37.539]  In the 70s, Nigeria has paid back with interest over $60 billion in just one loan.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.962]  The $3 billion loan, they've paid back over $40 billion.
[00:16:41.903 --> 00:16:43.124]  Still, they're in more debt.
[00:16:44.195 --> 00:16:45.498]  They can never get out of debt.
[00:16:45.719 --> 00:16:48.325]  So they take our tax money, give it to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:16:48.586 --> 00:16:53.638]  But in the past, Congress every year would be arm-twisted into this under the name of...
[00:16:56.585 --> 00:16:58.526]  Aid to other countries, but it's not aid.
[00:16:58.646 --> 00:17:19.252]  It's funding for the private IMF and World Bank in foreign aid to come in and take over those countries, and that's in State Department Memorandum 200, of course, from 1973 with Dr. Henry Kissinger stating it is to reduce population, and if the countries don't reduce population and don't cut food supplies, their governments won't be given the billions of dollars.
[00:17:19.592 --> 00:17:20.332]  So it's a payoff.
[00:17:21.857 --> 00:17:27.461]  So what's been announced is that world government is here whether you like it or not.
[00:17:28.722 --> 00:17:30.444]  And here is the London Telegraph on that.
[00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:34.327]  They'll be nowhere to run from the New World Order.
[00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:50.545]  And it goes on to say, the Committee to Save the World, Barack Obama, Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel, Gordon Brown, other leaders at the Copenhagen talks, signed an agreement for their nations unilaterally to fund the creation of the global governance system.
[00:17:51.285 --> 00:17:52.665]  Again, they're just coming out of the closet.
[00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:55.266]  It was built behind the giant steel curtains.
[00:17:55.306 --> 00:18:05.249]  Now they've rolled this juggernaut, this warmock, this colossus of tyranny and death and genocide out into the open, dressing it up as the savior of the world.
[00:18:06.414 --> 00:18:08.395]  Here's another key article, London Telegraph.
[00:18:08.815 --> 00:18:10.275]  Copenhagen Climate Summit.
[00:18:10.595 --> 00:18:12.996]  Plans for EU to police countries' emissions.
[00:18:13.496 --> 00:18:26.321]  Gordon Brown is drawing up plans for the European Union to become a global warming policeman, monitoring individual countries' compliance with cutting carbon emissions.
[00:18:26.921 --> 00:18:28.782]  Compliance with carbon cutting targets.
[00:18:29.659 --> 00:18:34.505]  So these nations didn't sign on, but through the IMF and World Bank they're controlled.
[00:18:34.565 --> 00:18:43.236]  But the West, in England, Gordon Brown is saying that even if the Parliament doesn't pass all these new taxes, he will implement it.
[00:18:44.218 --> 00:18:58.731]  In the United States, in the last week and a half, Obama has said, quote, even if Congress and the Senate won't ratify this, I will unilaterally order, quote, a command and control system to cut, and quote, it won't be pretty.
[00:18:59.092 --> 00:19:02.795]  So it's like a mobster saying, give me what I want or it won't be pretty, Bob.
[00:19:02.815 --> 00:19:04.316]  I'm going to smash your face in.
[00:19:05.117 --> 00:19:09.322]  So just open tyranny in your face.
[00:19:09.342 --> 00:19:11.825]  And then there are other headlines out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:19:11.865 --> 00:19:13.947]  President Obama and the New World Order.
[00:19:15.949 --> 00:19:17.451]  Here's another one out of the Washington Post.
[00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:21.916]  Copenhagen climate deal shows New World Order may be led by the US and China.
[00:19:24.684 --> 00:19:25.324]  Here's another one.
[00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:27.726]  In the New World Order, Sterling should suffer.
[00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:32.870]  Yes, England and their dollar, their pound, will suffer.
[00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:40.416]  When we come back, I'm going to play a clip of Gordon Brown pushing all of this and explaining
[00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:44.152]  That, oh, we're going to implement this regardless.
[00:19:44.992 --> 00:19:46.374]  This is your global government.
[00:19:46.454 --> 00:19:50.238]  Then, spy drones to enforce CO2 regulations.
[00:19:50.639 --> 00:19:52.781]  This has been announced by Barack Obama.
[00:19:53.242 --> 00:19:54.363]  Let me give you a news tip.
[00:19:55.264 --> 00:19:57.727]  It's already been going on for at least a decade.
[00:19:58.427 --> 00:19:59.509]  We're going to talk about this.
[00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:03.890]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.852]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:20:08.152 --> 00:20:11.613]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.611]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:03.551]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:03.891]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:08.852]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.992 --> 00:21:10.453]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.613 --> 00:21:11.233]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:11.693]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.773 --> 00:21:12.773]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.873 --> 00:21:15.674]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.834 --> 00:21:19.555]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.

[00:21:22.836 --> 00:21:25.177]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.478 --> 00:21:26.939]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:27.279]  Right!

[00:21:30.661 --> 00:21:31.201]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:31.241 --> 00:21:32.202]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.582 --> 00:21:36.104]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.444 --> 00:21:40.067]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:22:02.236 --> 00:22:03.277]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:03.678 --> 00:22:09.163]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:09.743 --> 00:22:10.244]  That's right.
[00:22:10.564 --> 00:22:12.846]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:13.407 --> 00:22:20.334]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:20.874 --> 00:22:28.556]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:33.877]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:34.497 --> 00:22:39.498]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:40.298 --> 00:22:44.419]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:44.819 --> 00:22:45.079]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:45.099 --> 00:22:47.001]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:47.382]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.402 --> 00:22:47.942]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.325 --> 00:23:03.508]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:03.868 --> 00:23:05.710]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:06.171 --> 00:23:06.591]  Don't!
[00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:10.054]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:10.475 --> 00:23:17.601]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:23:17.581 --> 00:23:19.263]  's number one debt secret.
[00:23:19.563 --> 00:23:23.227]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:23:23.627 --> 00:23:26.369]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:23:26.769 --> 00:23:33.794]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:23:34.135 --> 00:23:35.135]  Herb K was right.
[00:23:35.335 --> 00:23:38.398]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:23:38.518 --> 00:23:39.518]  What have you got to lose?
[00:23:39.879 --> 00:23:43.061]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:23:43.581 --> 00:23:47.244]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:23:47.524 --> 00:23:47.804]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:23:51.947 --> 00:23:52.288]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:23:52.308 --> 00:23:52.348]  888-352-7726.
[00:24:07.967 --> 00:24:16.797]  We believe that in the United Kingdom we can create something in the order of 400,000 jobs over the next few years from our low carbon industries and services alone.
[00:24:17.557 --> 00:24:23.824]  But I also want to emphasise that France and Britain and I believe all the other European countries recognise
[00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:41.996]  That to make possible a climate change deal which secures the future of our environment we have to work together to provide sufficient finance so that our developing country partners can make the changes that are necessary in their climate change policies to benefit the whole world.
[00:24:42.317 --> 00:24:47.180]  So there's never been any doubt that we would have to put up some money from the richest countries
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:54.124]  We have already agreed that there is money in the order of 10 billion dollars to be found over the next three years.
[00:24:54.644 --> 00:25:02.288]  We are able to finance that from the money that we are announcing today and I believe the rest of the European Union will come on board.
[00:25:02.788 --> 00:25:12.013]  This is the joint enterprise of France, Britain and many other European countries to make possible what I believe is absolutely essential for the world and that's a climate change agreement.
[00:25:19.637 --> 00:25:21.678]  So, that's how the spin works.
[00:25:21.738 --> 00:25:24.620]  They say there's no doubt this is happening.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.481]  There's no doubt we need these taxes.
[00:25:27.422 --> 00:25:31.304]  Oh, the agreement went really well, when it actually all blew up in their face, but they don't care.
[00:25:31.344 --> 00:25:32.205]  They're dictatorial.
[00:25:32.585 --> 00:25:36.748]  They're going to take more money from the West, shut down more of our industries.
[00:25:36.988 --> 00:25:38.749]  He lied and said it'll give you more jobs.
[00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:41.811]  And then, quote, give it to the third world.
[00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:46.494]  No, that means give it to the IMF and World Bank, and that's actually in scores of newspapers.
[00:25:47.734 --> 00:25:50.336]  Breaking down the actual plan.
[00:25:51.237 --> 00:25:54.800]  Breaking down the program of control.
[00:25:56.682 --> 00:26:13.357]  And so they're going to take your tax money and the nations they control, the West, and start giving it to the IMF and World Bank, and the IMF and World Bank with its private board, funded by your tax money, will start monitoring the system worldwide and developing the global governance structure further.
[00:26:14.332 --> 00:26:23.143]  Now here is a short one minute clip from the European Union Parliament with a British member breaking down the basic fraud in Brussels.
[00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:27.209]  Mr. Godfrey Bloom, one minute.
[00:26:28.471 --> 00:26:47.328]  Well, Mr President, I take the opportunity of wishing the East European cities well in the coming of the very early skiing season and snow and ice that's come there, which of course is indicative of the fact that, as independent science has now confirmed, that the globe is actually cooling and has been cooling since 2002, broadly flat since 1998.
[00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:54.575]  We're all talking about something here which isn't happening.
[00:26:55.076 --> 00:26:58.820]  I've heard time and time again members here talk of CO2 as a pollutant.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.663]  A pollutant is a life-giving natural gas.
[00:27:01.723 --> 00:27:05.968]  It gives me the impression that some of our members haven't had the benefit of a formal education.
[00:27:07.089 --> 00:27:15.971]  Isn't this really just about the state being able to get its hand in ordinary people's trouser pocket to steal yet more tax from them?
[00:27:16.711 --> 00:27:19.172]  Isn't this all about political control?
[00:27:19.652 --> 00:27:22.813]  Isn't all this about politics and big business?
[00:27:23.453 --> 00:27:31.855]  The whole thing's a sham, this bogus hypothesis, this ridiculous nonsense that man-made CO2 is causing global warming.
[00:27:32.255 --> 00:27:36.316]  Enough, please, before we damage irrevocably the global economy.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.721]  Absolutely.
[00:27:40.281 --> 00:27:51.230]  But there's this idea that the UN and the IMF and World Bank are stupid and really believe that the Earth is dying because of CO2, that the sea levels are rising when they're not rising.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.321]  They know it's a fraud.
[00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:58.926]  They need something to scare people into relinquishing their rights and freedoms.
[00:27:58.986 --> 00:28:14.142]  Now, coming up later, I'm going to play several clips from CNN where they have the former Microsoft head, the head of Microsoft Development and Science, this guy's got a security clearance above ultra,
[00:28:15.083 --> 00:28:22.747]  Calling for geoengineering or terraforming the planet with giant blimps that spray out sulfur dioxide.
[00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:38.896]  Now remember, the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, has already announced in his first speech 11 months ago, as the new science czar, the first thing he said was, we've been testing spraying from aircraft nuclei to, quote, cool the planet.
[00:28:39.356 --> 00:28:41.978]  Now we're looking at going fully operational.
[00:28:43.752 --> 00:28:47.755]  And they're suddenly admitting that they're already geoengineering the planet.
[00:28:48.235 --> 00:28:57.902]  So they're just throwing it out there like it's no big deal, hiding it in plain view, just like they're announcing global government out there like it's no big deal in plain view, in plain sight.
[00:28:58.843 --> 00:29:03.947]  Meanwhile, I have national reporters here every week to interview me for magazines and newspapers.
[00:29:04.347 --> 00:29:08.110]  I show them these clips, I give them documents, and they won't even look at them.
[00:29:09.011 --> 00:29:11.313]  And I say, see, they're setting up a private global government.
[00:29:11.613 --> 00:29:15.396]  And they say, but don't they mean something different of global government than what you mean?
[00:29:15.876 --> 00:29:26.804]  And I show them specific white papers where they state it's a global government to bring in a police state, that's a quote, a planetary regime to dominate and control all human activities.
[00:29:28.345 --> 00:29:29.126]  But they don't care.
[00:29:31.087 --> 00:29:37.591]  Because the public for 20-plus years was taught there's no such thing, and so people don't like to admit they've been conned.
[00:29:37.991 --> 00:29:43.455]  So even as global government's being openly set up, people can't resist it because they're so weak-minded.
[00:29:44.395 --> 00:29:45.056]  It's incredible.
[00:29:45.476 --> 00:29:48.678]  I'm called a crazy person because I read government documents.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.820]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.902]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.802 --> 00:29:57.504]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.267 --> 00:30:04.510]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.430]  Number one.
[00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.892]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.153 --> 00:30:09.733]  Number two.
[00:30:10.013 --> 00:30:14.576]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.916 --> 00:30:15.356]  It's true.
[00:30:15.657 --> 00:30:20.219]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:20.980]  Number three.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.622]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:28.665]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.846 --> 00:30:29.106]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.646 --> 00:30:32.008]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.408 --> 00:30:35.791]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.091 --> 00:30:36.291]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.871 --> 00:30:40.794]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.014 --> 00:30:45.778]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.058 --> 00:30:50.099]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.800]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.101]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:54.281 --> 00:30:56.622]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:00.796 --> 00:31:03.399]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.799 --> 00:31:08.764]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:09.144 --> 00:31:10.866]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:11.186 --> 00:31:16.011]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:16.191 --> 00:31:17.112]  How much do you want?
[00:31:17.352 --> 00:31:18.113]  When do you want it?
[00:31:18.473 --> 00:31:20.094]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:20.374 --> 00:31:21.195]  When will you need it?
[00:31:21.435 --> 00:31:23.516]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:23.636 --> 00:31:24.757]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:24.977 --> 00:31:26.318]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:26.518 --> 00:31:31.582]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.782 --> 00:31:34.964]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:35.364 --> 00:31:38.827]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:39.167 --> 00:31:40.168]  How much will you need?
[00:31:40.408 --> 00:31:41.009]  We don't know.
[00:31:41.309 --> 00:31:42.209]  How much do you want?
[00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.150]  All you can get.
[00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.191]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:44.431 --> 00:31:47.193]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:47.494 --> 00:31:49.235]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:50.176]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:05.037]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:32:05.157 --> 00:32:09.563]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:32:09.703 --> 00:32:11.546]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:32:11.966 --> 00:32:13.328]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:32:13.588 --> 00:32:14.630]  There is a solution.
[00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:22.873]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:32:23.273 --> 00:32:30.356]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:32:30.736 --> 00:32:36.398]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health major.
[00:32:36.758 --> 00:32:42.359]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:46.580]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:53.601]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[00:32:54.401 --> 00:32:57.702]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[00:33:06.736 --> 00:33:13.605]  Okay, coming up in the next hour, I'm going to get to CNN now admitting Kim trailing and that they want to launch through Microsoft patents.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:31.967]  Giant blimps that spray sulfur dioxide in the upper atmosphere to artificially cool the earth.
[00:33:32.388 --> 00:33:34.690]  This is terraforming or geoengineering.
[00:33:35.351 --> 00:33:38.475]  Again, 14 years ago I would talk about chemtrails and be laughed at.
[00:33:38.795 --> 00:33:45.383]  It's now declassified that there's a giant weather modification program going on, bare minimum.
[00:33:46.548 --> 00:33:47.750]  And the evidence is clear.
[00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:59.507]  The global government is manipulating the weather and I believe preparing to cause major weather disasters as a pretext for everyone to submit to global government.
[00:34:01.377 --> 00:34:02.898]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:34:02.958 --> 00:34:06.940]  Just as Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag to set up a police state in Germany.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.222]  Or just as the Tsars would bomb their political enemies and then blame them for it.
[00:34:13.022 --> 00:34:15.323]  This is a massive setup developing.
[00:34:15.583 --> 00:34:18.465]  We'll be covering that coming up in the next hour.
[00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:33.493]  Ladies and gentlemen, for the balance of the hour, in Jesse Ventura's stead, because the governor's now escaped to Mexico for a few months, we have Michael Braverman, the executive producer of Conspiracy Theory.
[00:34:34.474 --> 00:34:47.637]  And again, when I say this is a trailblazing, groundbreaking series that's gotten the highest ratings in the history of true TV, which has had some incredibly highly rated television shows,
[00:34:50.351 --> 00:34:52.193]  It is not hype.
[00:34:53.033 --> 00:34:57.076]  This show blew away my expectations.
[00:34:58.297 --> 00:35:05.862]  When I saw the episodes, I'd seen sections of them, heard about the shows, consulted some on the first seven episodes, appear in quite a few of the episodes.
[00:35:08.364 --> 00:35:14.748]  I trusted Jesse Ventura because I talked to him over a year ago when he visited with me for three days in Austin and he said,
[00:35:16.138 --> 00:35:19.741]  I have final cut on this, and I'm not going to do it unless they do what I want.
[00:35:19.761 --> 00:35:23.264]  He goes, I don't know if all this stuff's real, but I'm setting out with an open mind.
[00:35:23.988 --> 00:35:27.331]  And we would have big arguments and stuff about, you know, just how bad the New World Order was.
[00:35:27.732 --> 00:35:39.363]  And the shows really set out with an open mind and discover that, yes, global warming's a hoax, and discover, yes, there is Big Brother, and discover, yes, the government's hiding what really happened with 9-11.
[00:35:39.383 --> 00:35:43.907]  We're not completely sure what happened, but we know the official story's got holes in it that are giant.
[00:35:43.927 --> 00:35:45.428]  I mean, this is groundbreaking!
[00:35:45.869 --> 00:35:46.850]  Nothing like this
[00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:51.833]  Truly, from an objective perspective, has ever aired on national television.
[00:35:52.133 --> 00:35:56.096]  And I cannot tell you how honored I am to be involved with this.
[00:35:56.216 --> 00:35:58.117]  This is groundbreaking.
[00:35:58.157 --> 00:36:11.986]  And their global warming special made major news in a lot of papers because they got Ben Santer of the UN to admit he cut out sections of his own report where their own scientist at the UN told them that man was not causing global warming.
[00:36:12.566 --> 00:36:15.068]  Joining us is Michael Braverman.
[00:36:15.108 --> 00:36:19.792]  Michael, incredible job and thank you for including me in this program.
[00:36:20.533 --> 00:36:23.275]  Oh Alex, thank you so much and we're thrilled to have you.
[00:36:24.276 --> 00:36:36.506]  Well, I mean, tell people about the brainchild of this and the hell you went through to get it on TV and your doubts you could even get it on and now the amazing success and then what's coming up in the next few episodes.
[00:36:37.546 --> 00:36:39.288]  Well, I actually had a gentleman's bet.
[00:36:39.656 --> 00:36:43.438]  With Jesse Ventura, with the governor, that the show would never see the light of day.
[00:36:43.598 --> 00:36:50.801]  Even after they picked the show up and said, okay, y'all can do seven episodes, he still did not believe.
[00:36:51.581 --> 00:36:54.803]  I guess part of me didn't believe either that they would actually ever air these shows.
[00:36:55.143 --> 00:36:56.723]  They are so explosive.
[00:36:57.604 --> 00:37:02.166]  And we do have, we call it two revelations per show.
[00:37:02.746 --> 00:37:06.808]  We do have two facts per show that we worked really hard on finding out.
[00:37:07.628 --> 00:37:11.089]  Some of your listeners may know it, but I guarantee you the general public doesn't.
[00:37:11.749 --> 00:37:14.110]  And the reaction has been pretty amazing.
[00:37:15.591 --> 00:37:26.054]  Well, I mean, I can't watch a lot of television, and especially these reality shows, but the shows are really riveting.
[00:37:26.514 --> 00:37:32.276]  I mean, they're riveting, and it's a real whodunit Perry Mason investigation.
[00:37:32.796 --> 00:37:33.436]  It's amazing!
[00:37:34.316 --> 00:37:36.257]  Well, thank you, and we try to make them
[00:37:36.696 --> 00:37:37.957]  Obviously really entertaining.
[00:37:38.017 --> 00:37:40.138]  We don't want to do a dry documentary.
[00:37:41.019 --> 00:37:43.880]  So we try to keep it entertaining, and we try to keep it moving fast.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.782]  And thank you for the compliment about seeing who's done it.
[00:37:47.162 --> 00:37:48.923]  That's what we were really trying to get at.
[00:37:49.043 --> 00:37:55.487]  To get some information out there that people don't know, you've got to do it in an entertaining way.
[00:37:55.687 --> 00:37:58.408]  Otherwise, you know, no one's going to watch.
[00:37:58.849 --> 00:38:04.812]  So you have to really, really keep it entertaining to the general public, who may not be up to speed on some of these topics.
[00:38:07.796 --> 00:38:23.704]  Well, you've certainly done that, Michael, and let's spend some time on some of the previous episodes and then give people a little bird's eye view, an inside scoop on what's coming up Wednesday night and the next Wednesday night.
[00:38:24.184 --> 00:38:26.025]  Of course, Big Brother airs Wednesday night, 10 p.m.
[00:38:27.757 --> 00:38:28.777]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[00:38:28.817 --> 00:38:36.680]  Central, and then of course, next Wednesday, it's going to be the Secret Society episode that gets into population reduction, control, everything.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.841]  I'm a huge part of that program and very, very excited about it.
[00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:48.183]  But specifically, the Global Warming Special, I mean, you went right to the heart of it, to Maurice Strong, sent cameras to China.
[00:38:48.523 --> 00:38:50.004]  You went and interviewed the U.N.
[00:38:50.084 --> 00:38:50.704]  scientist.
[00:38:50.744 --> 00:38:52.945]  You went and interviewed myself.
[00:38:53.325 --> 00:38:53.685]  You got
[00:38:54.925 --> 00:38:58.127]  George Hunt, who's refused to do interviews in the last decade.
[00:38:58.608 --> 00:39:01.970]  We got him to talk, and he worked with Strong for over five years.
[00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:04.232]  I mean, this was an amazing television show.
[00:39:05.232 --> 00:39:05.753]  Well, thank you.
[00:39:05.873 --> 00:39:19.983]  And, you know, the thing about getting those people is we work really hard, as I said before, about coming up with stuff that even people that are up to speed on this may not know or may not have had the chance to know.
[00:39:20.343 --> 00:39:21.504]  I mean, this guy, Ben Santer,
[00:39:22.287 --> 00:39:31.033]  No, a lot of people had said, oh, Ben Sander put the data, and for him to admit on camera, as he said, that, well, yeah, I did, but of course he has an explanation for it.
[00:39:32.735 --> 00:39:37.238]  You know, and when we were doing the show, the network was really scared.
[00:39:37.258 --> 00:39:39.499]  Oh, you know, how can you attack global warming?
[00:39:39.539 --> 00:39:41.341]  You know, everyone knows global warming is a bad thing.
[00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:45.204]  And even Governor Ventura was like, oh, I believe in global warming.
[00:39:45.684 --> 00:39:51.288]  At the end of the show, all of us involved in it, behind the scenes, all looked at each other and went,
[00:39:51.846 --> 00:39:54.367]  Wow, we really came up with some information.
[00:39:54.647 --> 00:39:59.388]  Then, got to Climategate, which validated everything we said.
[00:39:59.728 --> 00:40:01.828]  Absolutely validated everything we said.
[00:40:02.488 --> 00:40:07.669]  So, we all sat around the production office and sort of were patting ourselves on the back going, wow, we were ahead of that curve.
[00:40:08.569 --> 00:40:09.830]  And, you know, we really were.
[00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.230]  And that was a really good feeling.
[00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.011]  Let's talk about that.
[00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:15.671]  In the last three months,
[00:40:16.856 --> 00:40:31.055]  Because I mean these shows are very fresh they were being shot right up to the last minute I was in Los Angeles just a month and a half ago Organizing with you guys the George Hunt interview and then you guys had the show in the can and
[00:40:31.856 --> 00:40:32.116]  I don't
[00:40:51.711 --> 00:40:55.433]  What you guys had separately discovered, that shows what a good investigation you were doing.
[00:40:55.453 --> 00:41:02.517]  You interviewed Lord Monckton and so many others right before Monckton already burst on the scene here in the U.S.
[00:41:02.557 --> 00:41:09.240]  and became a phenomenon with tens of millions of views on YouTube of his speeches and the interviews we've done here live on the radio.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:17.525]  I mean, perfect timing as the entire global warming, man-made global warming fraud burst into flames, the television show airs.
[00:41:17.565 --> 00:41:19.546]  I mean, talk about providence.
[00:41:20.126 --> 00:41:22.687]  That's almost Revolutionary War-level providence.
[00:41:24.187 --> 00:41:27.168]  Yeah, I mean, I'd like to think it's that important.
[00:41:27.188 --> 00:41:28.188]  I mean, we did get lucky.
[00:41:28.668 --> 00:41:32.429]  You know, the thing that convinced me was Richard Lyndon.
[00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.310]  You know, I know you saw him.
[00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:37.251]  He's a classic MIT professor.
[00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:40.892]  You know, I doubt he knows how to, you know, turn his car on or change a light bulb.
[00:41:40.912 --> 00:41:43.753]  He spent his whole life studying climate.
[00:41:43.813 --> 00:41:45.653]  And this guy is an MIT professor.
[00:41:45.873 --> 00:41:48.654]  He's got no X. He doesn't work for the oil company.
[00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.791]  You're my guy.
[00:42:11.883 --> 00:42:14.484]  And also, you guys, this is really reality TV.
[00:42:14.564 --> 00:42:19.467]  You shot in your war room with Jesse and yourself and other members of the production.
[00:42:19.767 --> 00:42:23.508]  You're all arguing about whether it's real or not.
[00:42:23.568 --> 00:42:27.170]  And Jesse says, well, I think they're making money off this, but it still might be real.
[00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:31.312]  And you are the guy who says, no, guys, I've seen the documentation.
[00:42:31.692 --> 00:42:33.093]  It looks like this is a scam.
[00:42:33.113 --> 00:42:34.553]  I mean, I got to hand it to you.
[00:42:34.914 --> 00:42:35.514]  That was shot what?
[00:42:35.794 --> 00:42:38.275]  Well, I read the research really carefully, and I'll tell you something funny.
[00:42:38.295 --> 00:42:41.777]  This coming week's episode, this Wednesday night, exactly the opposite happened.
[00:42:41.797 --> 00:42:46.059]  You'll see me in the War Room, and I really get into it with Jesse about the Big Brother issue.
[00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:46.739]  I'll do a little segue here.
[00:43:00.815 --> 00:43:04.298]  Him and he and I really got into it, and it wasn't fake.
[00:43:04.418 --> 00:43:05.759]  We got hot at each other.
[00:43:05.779 --> 00:43:08.200]  I was kind of saying, well, wait a minute.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:22.070]  You know, I'm not saying the Patriot Act is a good thing, but, you know, a couple of terrorists are sitting on cell phones, and they're, you know, they're at a rally, having a burger, and they're talking about blowing up the mall that I'm about to go into with my family.
[00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.711]  I damn well want to know about it.
[00:43:24.092 --> 00:43:25.893]  He got really hot at me.
[00:43:26.894 --> 00:43:29.035]  That's the way I felt at the beginning of the episode.
[00:43:29.235 --> 00:43:30.096]  What you don't see,
[00:43:31.248 --> 00:43:32.329]  It's because we didn't have time.
[00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:37.633]  At the end of the episode, when I look at him and I go... I don't know if I can curse on your show, but... No, don't!
[00:43:37.653 --> 00:43:38.154]  No, don't!
[00:43:39.034 --> 00:43:39.995]  I'm not joking.
[00:43:40.516 --> 00:43:43.858]  I go, holy... You were right, and I was wrong.
[00:43:44.198 --> 00:43:47.041]  So the drama of the episode is real.
[00:43:47.621 --> 00:43:49.022]  Again, you'll see me in the war room.
[00:43:49.042 --> 00:43:52.485]  It's just really getting hot in here, but he gets hot at me.
[00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:56.228]  So it's really interesting what happens, how we change during these shows.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.761]  Yeah, for folks that don't know, Jesse's for real.
[00:44:00.241 --> 00:44:04.763]  Getting to hang out with him over the last three, four years, I guess four years ago is when I first met him.
[00:44:06.184 --> 00:44:08.665]  And being off camera, he's really a smart guy.
[00:44:08.685 --> 00:44:12.186]  He's multifaceted, but he really does get angry.
[00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:15.147]  Yeah, and he's passionate.
[00:44:15.167 --> 00:44:15.907]  He's absolutely a believer.
[00:44:15.927 --> 00:44:18.928]  We are not going to do a show unless he believes in it.
[00:44:18.968 --> 00:44:20.788]  And here's a guy who sits and reads
[00:44:42.244 --> 00:44:43.525]  He reads all day long.
[00:44:44.206 --> 00:44:47.288]  Spends his time really doing the research, really doing the reading.
[00:44:47.588 --> 00:44:49.470]  We don't do a topic unless he believes in it.
[00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:51.671]  Global warming was a bit of a push.
[00:44:52.112 --> 00:44:53.873]  As I say at the beginning, he didn't believe in it.
[00:44:53.933 --> 00:44:58.697]  But at the end of the episode, and now with climate big, he was totally a convert.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.321]  And it's not just a whodunit.
[00:45:01.481 --> 00:45:04.784]  Everyone watching is literally brought along with the process.
[00:45:04.944 --> 00:45:08.267]  And I have to say it, this is something new in reality TV.
[00:45:08.347 --> 00:45:16.273]  Usually it's some rich teenager with her boyfriends getting drunk and fighting with her parents on the telephone and car wrecks.
[00:45:17.094 --> 00:45:23.619]  This is a bunch of researchers and Governor Jesse Ventura literally trying to get to the bottom of something.
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:28.704]  You are transported there to the debates, to the interviews,
[00:45:29.704 --> 00:45:32.046]  Uh, to the different places in the world that you guys travel.
[00:45:33.267 --> 00:45:38.490]  Yeah, and that backstage stuff, or that war room stuff, that stuff is real.
[00:45:38.771 --> 00:45:43.954]  We, you know, and you'll see there are other guys, Alex Piper is his name, and he's our skeptic.
[00:45:44.795 --> 00:45:46.936]  He and the governor really get into it.
[00:45:46.956 --> 00:45:48.557]  I mean, you should see what happens off camera.
[00:45:48.877 --> 00:45:52.220]  These guys will just go toe-to-toe, and they'll battle it out.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.921]  They will absolutely battle it out.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.200]  It's amazing.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:10.087]  I know you don't want to give people too much of a spoiler on this, but for our listeners, Michael Braverman, executive producer of the number one new television show on TruTV, Conspiracy Theory, that airs 10 p.m.
[00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:10.928]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[00:46:11.228 --> 00:46:12.489]  Central, every Wednesday night.
[00:46:13.369 --> 00:46:18.292]  Give us a little bit of a window into this week's episode that airs in 48 hours.
[00:46:19.452 --> 00:46:24.775]  Well, I want to say one thing to your listeners, Alex, that there's one show in this series
[00:46:25.424 --> 00:46:26.285]  That you're going to watch.
[00:46:26.505 --> 00:46:27.325]  Make it 15.
[00:46:28.426 --> 00:46:36.331]  This week's show, and obviously I have a little stake in it, but this week's show blew me away when I started doing the research.
[00:46:36.371 --> 00:46:38.112]  The staff and I started doing the research.
[00:46:38.753 --> 00:46:42.135]  I can tell you without hyping it, there are two facts.
[00:46:42.955 --> 00:46:49.359]  This show, which is the Big Brother Conspiracy, this Wednesday night, there are two facts that will absolutely blow you away.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.683]  There's stuff that we uncovered that I didn't know about,
[00:46:55.456 --> 00:47:10.883]  I'm a pretty good researcher, and we put it on the screen, and again, I don't think it's hyping or being immodest to say that there's a couple of revelations, I'll call them, that will absolutely shock you and hit you over the head, and you're going to be sitting at home going, what?
[00:47:11.383 --> 00:47:12.163]  I didn't know that!
[00:47:12.583 --> 00:47:13.964]  And you know what?
[00:47:14.044 --> 00:47:23.808]  It's a call to action, because if we don't do something, you know, in five, ten, three, six years, whatever it is, we are going to be living on the prison planet.
[00:47:25.504 --> 00:47:26.244]  Absolutely.
[00:47:26.785 --> 00:47:40.071]  Now, talking to Ventura a year ago when the pilot was shot, which is the 9-11 episode, the rest of it was shot this year, and talking to you behind the scenes and others, whatever you want to say about the mainstream media, they have never allowed anything like this to air before.
[00:47:41.526 --> 00:47:42.667]  I don't think so.
[00:47:59.775 --> 00:48:01.236]  I don't know how the 9-11 aired.
[00:48:01.657 --> 00:48:02.037]  Why?
[00:48:02.498 --> 00:48:05.020]  Because I know there's a lot of control over the media.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.064]  You know, every person in a production company or at a network isn't a globalist agent.
[00:48:09.784 --> 00:48:13.187]  But they, you know, don't like to go with things that are too controversial against the government.
[00:48:13.588 --> 00:48:15.069]  How is this getting on the air?
[00:48:15.089 --> 00:48:16.871]  I mean, how did you guys do this?
[00:48:16.891 --> 00:48:19.433]  I mean, you've done something no one's ever done!
[00:48:19.453 --> 00:48:22.696]  Well, I give all the credit to the governor.
[00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:25.679]  The governor was so passionate, as I said before,
[00:48:26.198 --> 00:48:27.039]  He went to the network.
[00:48:27.099 --> 00:48:27.639]  I went with him.
[00:48:28.479 --> 00:48:32.162]  And he sat there and looked at the boss of the network in the eye.
[00:48:32.682 --> 00:48:35.203]  I give everybody credit here, including the boss of the network.
[00:48:35.784 --> 00:48:38.145]  He looked him in the eye and said, let me do this show.
[00:48:38.545 --> 00:48:42.808]  You let me cover the topics, the information I want to cover.
[00:48:43.308 --> 00:48:44.969]  I will guarantee you people will watch.
[00:48:45.149 --> 00:48:46.710]  And that's exactly how it turned out.
[00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:55.075]  And, you know, I'm the first guy, because I work in the TV business, I'm the first guy to knock, you know, finalist TV executive.
[00:48:55.822 --> 00:48:59.946]  I've met my share of them, but I will give TruTV an amazing amount of credit.
[00:49:00.607 --> 00:49:04.991]  They actually followed through, and they had the courage of their convictions, and they put the show on.
[00:49:05.151 --> 00:49:12.197]  And as I say, you know, the governor lost his gentleman's bet with me and everybody else that those would ever see the light of day, but here we are.
[00:49:12.778 --> 00:49:13.759]  So it's kind of a miracle.
[00:49:15.444 --> 00:49:18.426]  Well, Wednesday night, 10 p.m.
[00:49:18.906 --> 00:49:20.086]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:20.607]  Central.
[00:49:21.107 --> 00:49:36.315]  Folks, we need this show to continue to be an even bigger success, because this will force mainstream media to understand that the American people are waking up and want the truth, and that if the mainstream media doesn't start covering these issues, they're going to lose all their viewers.
[00:49:36.355 --> 00:49:37.976]  And I think, at the heart of it,
[00:49:38.826 --> 00:49:53.504]  I remember three years ago I was talking to a Hollywood film director and I don't know if she's still there, I don't know the details, but he was talking about a new head of Court TV and that it was going to shift to a new format and he said they were looking then at these issues and then I talked to
[00:49:54.145 --> 00:50:09.271]  A BBC producer who also makes shows for the US, and I know that TruTV even three years ago was looking at this, so I think Ventura with his gravitas and his history and yourself, Michael Braverman, the right place, the right time, the right people, the right brains.
[00:50:10.731 --> 00:50:18.254]  Cable television has to start doing something avant-garde to get viewers, and I think that's the real reason that this is airing.
[00:50:18.554 --> 00:50:21.255]  And also, you know, you guys did this on a shoestring
[00:50:21.795 --> 00:50:22.195]  Well, thank you.
[00:50:22.215 --> 00:50:23.596]  And our production partners do too.
[00:50:23.616 --> 00:50:26.959]  And again, I give all the credit to the Governor because he is the spearhead.
[00:50:27.019 --> 00:50:29.881]  He was the point of the spear on this whole show.
[00:50:40.305 --> 00:50:42.667]  And you guys put amazing amounts of energy into this.
[00:50:42.767 --> 00:50:47.170]  Final segment with Michael Braverman, the executive producer of Conspiracy Theory.
[00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:48.431]  You can see it this Wednesday night.
[00:50:48.711 --> 00:50:55.677]  When we come back, we're going to do five minutes on next week's episode, Secret Societies.
[00:50:56.157 --> 00:50:58.078]  This one is a barn burner.
[00:50:58.098 --> 00:50:58.619]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.697 --> 00:51:01.037]  Hello.
[00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:05.763]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.

[00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:15.716]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:51:16.076 --> 00:51:19.998]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[00:51:20.158 --> 00:51:24.080]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.741]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[00:51:27.001 --> 00:51:27.922]  It was empowering.
[00:51:28.042 --> 00:51:31.944]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[00:51:32.024 --> 00:51:34.825]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[00:51:34.845 --> 00:51:37.566]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[00:51:37.586 --> 00:51:38.467]  Thank you so much.
[00:51:38.687 --> 00:51:41.448]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[00:51:41.528 --> 00:51:42.108]  Thanks again.
[00:51:42.289 --> 00:51:44.890]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[00:51:45.658 --> 00:51:48.660]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.462]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.

[00:52:01.868 --> 00:52:05.511]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.871 --> 00:52:08.893]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.133 --> 00:52:10.534]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.238 --> 00:52:13.899]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.919 --> 00:52:20.140]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:25.321]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.841 --> 00:52:35.463]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.603 --> 00:52:37.704]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:37.944 --> 00:52:39.264]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.524 --> 00:52:41.825]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.985 --> 00:52:43.845]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.105 --> 00:52:48.927]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.267 --> 00:52:58.610]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:53:29.949 --> 00:53:30.429]  I think so.
[00:54:08.541 --> 00:54:14.506]  The Prison Planet will be exposed Wednesday night, 10 p.m.
[00:54:14.566 --> 00:54:15.867]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[00:54:15.927 --> 00:54:17.088]  Central, 8 p.m.
[00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.649]  Mountain, 7 p.m.
[00:54:17.669 --> 00:54:19.130]  Pacific on TruTV.
[00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:20.471]  Check your listings.
[00:54:36.169 --> 00:54:39.150]  And believe me, ladies and gentlemen, the prison planet will be exposed.
[00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:44.772]  It's one thing when I'm up here ranting about documents, about everything you're doing being tracked and traced and surveilled and controlled.
[00:54:45.072 --> 00:54:46.613]  Wait till you see it the way they present it.
[00:54:47.033 --> 00:54:50.274]  Big, breaking information coming up Wednesday night.
[00:54:50.374 --> 00:54:58.076]  Please tell everybody you know, your email list, your Facebook, your MySpace, because we need this show to continue and be picked up again.
[00:54:58.116 --> 00:54:59.077]  But it's got top ratings.
[00:54:59.117 --> 00:54:59.737]  It should be.
[00:55:00.177 --> 00:55:02.058]  Something's rotten in the state of Denmark if it isn't.
[00:55:02.598 --> 00:55:05.399]  In the three or four minutes we've got left with Michael Braverman,
[00:55:07.542 --> 00:55:13.165]  Looking forward to the Secret Society episode next week, in case we don't get you back on to talk about it.
[00:55:13.746 --> 00:55:17.148]  Next Wednesday, give us a little window into that.
[00:55:17.168 --> 00:55:21.691]  Well, that is another mind-blower.
[00:55:22.131 --> 00:55:27.534]  You know, this is something that I think the Governor also was a little bit skeptical about when we started.
[00:55:28.875 --> 00:55:33.578]  You know, I mean, you can sit around and talk, and I know you do, Alex, and you do a fantastic job.
[00:55:33.738 --> 00:55:35.940]  You know, you can say that there are these groups, like Bilderberg,
[00:55:36.664 --> 00:55:40.707]  You know, society, and they're out there, and they're running the world, and everyone's going to roll their eyes and go, yeah, sure.
[00:55:41.648 --> 00:55:55.678]  But when you started, you know, when we started to dig into it, we found some stuff, as they say, you know, anybody who watches these shows, whether you like the shows or not, you're going to turn that TV off, and you're going to walk away, or you're going to sit on your couch, and you're going to go, wow, I didn't know that.
[00:55:56.298 --> 00:56:04.945]  You're going to see some facts about the Bilderberg that I guarantee you even people who are regular listeners to your show and really into this stuff didn't know.
[00:56:05.478 --> 00:56:12.441]  So that's our promise to the viewers is that there's going to be new facts, new things that hopefully will be mind-blowing every week.
[00:56:12.881 --> 00:56:18.344]  And there are things about the Gilderbergs and other secret societies that I gotta be honest with you, they scared me.
[00:56:22.096 --> 00:56:31.063]  Well, I did Consulting for a Scanner Darkly, produced in 2005 with Keanu Reeves, Leona Ryder, Woody Harrelson, a bunch of others.
[00:56:31.083 --> 00:56:31.924]  Of course, I'm in the film.
[00:56:31.944 --> 00:56:37.028]  And I did Consulting with Tommy Pallotta, one of the producers, and Richard Linklater, the director.
[00:56:37.848 --> 00:56:39.229]  And I thought I knew everything.
[00:56:39.289 --> 00:56:40.671]  They discovered a bunch of stuff that
[00:56:41.391 --> 00:56:48.897]  Well, it's amazing what's going on that, as you say Alex, never gets reported in the mainstream media, but I think that's changing, and hopefully it's changing.
[00:56:48.977 --> 00:56:51.199]  I'll tell you what, you mentioned Hollywood.
[00:56:51.239 --> 00:56:55.022]  I get calls from people that are not allowed to make movies.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.621]  Michael, your phone's breaking up a little bit.
[00:57:15.641 --> 00:57:16.542]  Can you get closer to it?
[00:57:18.243 --> 00:57:26.750]  Sounds good, go ahead.
[00:57:31.034 --> 00:57:36.238]  Michael, you know, I think it's your... because I know you're on a cell phone doing a screening at an event, and I apologize.
[00:57:36.258 --> 00:57:39.121]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, just in closing, finish up.
[00:57:39.141 --> 00:57:40.582]  Yeah, get in close to the microphone.
[00:57:41.351 --> 00:57:42.171]  Yeah, I'm pretty close.
[00:57:42.952 --> 00:57:54.756]  So anyway, just to reiterate, there's people I get calls on a weekly basis from big stars, TV stars, movie stars, people that everybody would know, who want to talk about this stuff, who are starting to believe in this stuff.
[00:57:55.556 --> 00:58:06.600]  I can't put them on TV yet, but if we get picked up, people support us, and we go on, I think there's going to be some real shockers, hopefully in the second season, about people stepping out of the shadows.
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:07.620]  Famous people.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.881]  You see on TV, and you see in the movies, stepping out of the shadows.
[00:58:11.842 --> 00:58:36.854]  Yeah, that's what I've found, and obviously I'm not in Hollywood and I'm not a big TV producer like yourself, but I can't believe, I mean the top name Hollywood stars, obviously Charlie Sheen, people like Jesse Ventura that have come on my show, that we've woken up to a certain extent, well Charlie's completely awake and Ventura's waking up, it's just, it's a huge iceberg that we only see the tip of.
[00:58:37.294 --> 00:58:39.335]  Michael Braverman, stay there, let me say bye to you during the break.
[00:58:42.307 --> 00:58:44.309]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:58.581]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.380]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.101]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio.
[01:00:03.023 --> 01:00:03.623]  Big Brother.
[01:00:04.315 --> 01:00:05.376]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:06.097 --> 01:00:07.198]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:07.858 --> 01:00:08.659]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.341]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:14.664]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.184 --> 01:00:19.228]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.224 --> 01:00:25.426]  Alright, I'm going to play a short clip.
[01:00:25.526 --> 01:00:32.756]  I'm going to play more of it coming up in the next hour with CNN, the head scientist for Microsoft, admitting terraforming the planet.
[01:00:33.076 --> 01:00:38.123]  But finishing up with Michael Braverman, one of the guys behind the hit TV show...
[01:00:39.304 --> 01:00:44.348]  Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura premiering with the next episode this Wednesday night on Big Brother.
[01:00:44.788 --> 01:00:51.272]  Yeah, you know, I never asked you or Jesse that question, but I should have asked you that when we've been hanging out and working together.
[01:00:51.913 --> 01:00:57.176]  If I've had all these Hollywood stars call me, but they never want to go on air, most of them, I mean, you name it, folks.
[01:00:57.676 --> 01:01:03.000]  When I worked with Keanu Reeves and, of course, with Bruce Willis, he's now no longer a neocon.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.441]  He's totally into this now.
[01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:05.922]  That's a few people I can talk about.
[01:01:07.723 --> 01:01:08.143]  Obviously.
[01:01:08.163 --> 01:01:10.024]  I'm not going to say any more names.
[01:01:10.244 --> 01:01:11.124]  Folks, you wouldn't believe it.
[01:01:11.944 --> 01:01:12.565]  Okay, I'll say it.
[01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:13.125]  Brad Pitt.
[01:01:13.385 --> 01:01:14.445]  I mean, stuff like that.
[01:01:14.885 --> 01:01:15.706]  It's insane.
[01:01:16.446 --> 01:01:19.447]  Give us a hint, Michael, about some of the huge stars that are calling you.
[01:01:20.667 --> 01:01:22.748]  Well, you hit on a couple names there.
[01:01:22.768 --> 01:01:25.729]  Of course, I'm sworn to secrecy by them and their agents.
[01:01:26.269 --> 01:01:32.351]  Oh, see, I didn't even know that and I already... If you're not sworn to secrecy, that's cool.
[01:01:33.992 --> 01:01:38.296]  I can tell you that, I can tell you that, um, it's people that, you know, I was shocked.
[01:01:38.517 --> 01:01:42.621]  I mean, you know, Tector Colony, I got a cable show and, you know, who am I in there?
[01:01:42.641 --> 01:01:44.122]  You know, these big names are calling me.
[01:01:44.502 --> 01:01:45.563]  And I've met with some of them.
[01:01:45.804 --> 01:01:49.547]  In secret, you know, uh, kind of out of the way restaurants.
[01:01:50.108 --> 01:01:52.930]  And, you know, again, it sounds like I'm hyping it, I'm really not.
[01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.473]  These are names that would blow your mind, they blew my mind.
[01:01:56.353 --> 01:01:58.836]  And I said to all of them, I said, look,
[01:01:59.753 --> 01:02:02.514]  At some point, you have to be bigger than yourself.
[01:02:02.654 --> 01:02:03.615]  You've got to step out.
[01:02:04.075 --> 01:02:07.656]  You've got to do what you need to do for your country and what you believe in.
[01:02:08.116 --> 01:02:10.757]  I keep beating that drum.
[01:02:11.558 --> 01:02:18.540]  Again, hopefully if everyone supports us and we get a good rating this week for the Big Brother Conspiracy Show, hopefully we'll go on.
[01:02:19.121 --> 01:02:24.943]  I do believe that in our second season, there will be people coming on this show that will shock everybody.
[01:02:26.414 --> 01:02:27.094]  Unbelievable.
[01:02:27.215 --> 01:02:35.179]  I'm just so honored to be involved with you, Michael Braverman, and notice you just broke that about all these big stars contacting you last segment.
[01:02:35.199 --> 01:02:35.959]  I didn't even know that.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:54.630]  And you notice I just threw out some names because I can't believe over the last five, six, seven years, I mean, obviously Charlie Sheen has come on air a bunch, and this is basically all he thinks about and works on, but he tells me separately, not just people I've been contacted by or I've met with,
[01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:57.932]  But then I talked to other directors, other movie stars.
[01:02:58.412 --> 01:03:03.715]  Basically, 80% of all the top stars are completely obsessed with this.
[01:03:03.975 --> 01:03:05.056]  It's not snowboarding.
[01:03:05.356 --> 01:03:07.097]  It's not hookers they're obsessed with.
[01:03:07.698 --> 01:03:08.598]  It's not partying.
[01:03:08.638 --> 01:03:09.479]  It's not surfing.
[01:03:09.899 --> 01:03:11.300]  They are obsessed with this.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.782]  Hollywood is on fire and awake to the new world order.
[01:03:15.142 --> 01:03:16.563]  How do we get them to come out?
[01:03:16.923 --> 01:03:21.346]  And then you get a cultural shift away from the fake left that Hollywood's been known as.
[01:03:22.087 --> 01:03:24.248]  Michael, we are sitting on top
[01:03:24.528 --> 01:03:25.509]  Of something really big.
[01:03:25.529 --> 01:03:26.689]  I mean, do you get that feeling?
[01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:29.971]  Yeah, I think we could be, and, you know, but you've got to understand one thing.
[01:03:30.091 --> 01:03:36.474]  Charlie Sheen, when he came out of the shadows, he has taken unbelievable abuse.
[01:03:37.154 --> 01:03:38.255]  Unbelievable abuse.
[01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:43.697]  And I will go so far as to say he's probably hurt his career, even though he's got a nice career, obviously, he's on a TV show.
[01:03:44.157 --> 01:03:49.820]  But it takes courage, because the left, you know, the old left that really still runs Hollywood,
[01:03:51.386 --> 01:03:54.608]  They are militantly opposed to anybody talking about these issues.
[01:03:54.868 --> 01:03:55.769]  Militantly opposed.
[01:03:56.369 --> 01:03:58.150]  So, now that's something that we all deal with.
[01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:02.332]  And for Kennedy Stars to come out, I applaud him because it takes a huge amount of courage.
[01:04:02.984 --> 01:04:05.366]  You know, again, I'm aware of this.
[01:04:05.466 --> 01:04:06.326]  Most people aren't.
[01:04:06.366 --> 01:04:12.250]  You're more aware of it than I. Michael Breiberman, again, big TV producer with a lot of hit shows and things under his belt.
[01:04:12.851 --> 01:04:13.671]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:04:13.811 --> 01:04:17.654]  I don't think listeners realize the sea change this signifies.
[01:04:18.214 --> 01:04:21.036]  And I don't see how they're not going to pick it back up with these record ratings.
[01:04:21.076 --> 01:04:24.258]  But as you said, there's a lot of powerful people out there.
[01:04:24.298 --> 01:04:27.781]  That's why it's so important this show even be a bigger hit.
[01:04:27.861 --> 01:04:32.704]  Because ladies and gentlemen, you will see top movie stars on television.
[01:04:33.984 --> 01:04:56.912]  on this program and you guys are trailblazers and so to the victor goes the spoils Michael you certainly have hit the barbed wire you are like Lewis and Clark you and Jesse Ventura and I am just ecstatic to be involved we're gonna let you go I'm gonna say bye to you during this break but we will let you go now to get back to your meeting it airs this Wednesday night the Big Brother special folks tell everybody you know
[01:04:58.137 --> 01:05:02.359]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:02.679 --> 01:05:03.299]  Number one.
[01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:06.740]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:07.021 --> 01:05:07.581]  Number two.
[01:05:07.881 --> 01:05:12.423]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:12.763 --> 01:05:13.223]  It's true.
[01:05:13.503 --> 01:05:18.065]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:18.365 --> 01:05:18.926]  Number 3.
[01:05:19.206 --> 01:05:22.490]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:22.791 --> 01:05:26.535]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:26.715 --> 01:05:27.256]  Number 4.
[01:05:27.496 --> 01:05:29.879]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.664]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:33.944 --> 01:05:34.144]  Number 5.
[01:05:34.725 --> 01:05:38.647]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:43.630]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:47.953]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:48.093 --> 01:05:49.674]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.894 --> 01:05:54.477]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:05:59.773 --> 01:06:03.394]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:03.734 --> 01:06:11.876]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:12.597 --> 01:06:16.638]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:17.218 --> 01:06:28.041]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:28.681 --> 01:06:37.683]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:38.183 --> 01:06:43.244]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:50.806]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:51.106 --> 01:06:53.847]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:58.962 --> 01:07:02.586]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:02.966 --> 01:07:05.969]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:06.209 --> 01:07:10.994]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:07:11.014 --> 01:07:17.260]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:17.421 --> 01:07:19.663]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:20.143 --> 01:07:20.463]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:20.483 --> 01:07:20.904]  Bernanke?
[01:07:20.984 --> 01:07:21.765]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:21.785 --> 01:07:22.926]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:22.946 --> 01:07:25.187]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:39.079 --> 01:07:40.920]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:46.084]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:46.345 --> 01:07:56.312]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:03.337 --> 01:08:03.938]  Big Brother.
[01:08:04.628 --> 01:08:09.929]  Man, that Michael Braverman conversation just blew me away.
[01:08:09.989 --> 01:08:13.230]  See, I don't bug all these Hollywood people.
[01:08:27.845 --> 01:08:30.487]  And if Braverman calls me every few weeks, I call him, we talk.
[01:08:31.068 --> 01:08:35.692]  I'm going to be a bigger part as a consultant, bigger part of the TV show, already the biggest part outside of Ventura.
[01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:41.096]  With Conspiracy Theory, number one show on TruTV right now, highest ratings ever for a new show.
[01:08:41.396 --> 01:08:47.702]  Exposing Al Gore as a fraud, Maurice Strong, the New World Order, Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis all freaking out.
[01:08:48.282 --> 01:08:50.584]  I mean, you just can't, it doesn't get any better than this.
[01:08:50.864 --> 01:08:52.506]  You've got the old Hollywood Order.
[01:08:53.126 --> 01:08:53.967]  The old left.
[01:08:53.987 --> 01:08:58.671]  You got Michael Braverman, who's pretty high-powered, talking about the old left freaking out.
[01:08:58.851 --> 01:08:59.992]  This is not a left-right issue.
[01:09:00.252 --> 01:09:01.994]  They just want to keep that paradigm in place.
[01:09:02.194 --> 01:09:03.876]  There is a rebellion in Hollywood.
[01:09:04.176 --> 01:09:06.738]  I have known about this for at least a decade.
[01:09:06.978 --> 01:09:08.280]  Big time for six years.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.642]  And Charlie Sheen broke the ice on this.
[01:09:11.703 --> 01:09:13.744]  I just, we are so close, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:13.764 --> 01:09:16.347]  We are so close to shifting the entire paradigm.
[01:09:17.895 --> 01:09:20.477]  That was some breaking news you just heard.
[01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:31.524]  Just like Conspiracy Theory last week with Ventura got Bill Santer on video to admit he cut out five scientists in his own internal report for the IPCC saying man does not contribute to global warming.
[01:09:31.865 --> 01:09:33.326]  That the earth may not even be warming.
[01:09:33.846 --> 01:09:34.687]  This is incredible.
[01:09:35.027 --> 01:09:47.542]  Okay, for the rest of the hour, then I'm getting into the terraforming being announced, the geoengineering on CNN, now the global warming control freaks want to, quote, control our weather, probably so they can create calamities and get their pretext for global taxes.
[01:09:47.882 --> 01:09:53.909]  James Dillingpole is a best-selling author, journalist,
[01:09:54.964 --> 01:09:58.065]  Author, TV critic, Daily Telegraph.
[01:09:59.006 --> 01:10:01.847]  He also writes for so many other great publications.
[01:10:02.707 --> 01:10:05.909]  He's a British journalist and novelist, was educated at Christ Church, Oxford.
[01:10:05.929 --> 01:10:15.053]  He's a member of several, author of several novels and two non-fiction books, How to Be Right, The Essential Guide to Making Lefty Liberals History.
[01:10:16.133 --> 01:10:17.654]  And welcome to Obama-land.
[01:10:17.774 --> 01:10:19.415]  I have seen the future and it doesn't work.
[01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:22.877]  He writes for The Daily Telegraph and is a TV critic for The Spectator.
[01:10:23.297 --> 01:10:27.960]  He has a blog, The Daily Telegraph, which he uses to disprove man-made climate change.
[01:10:28.701 --> 01:10:34.224]  And this is so exciting to have him on because he's one of the most prolific and detailed writers in The Telegraph.
[01:10:35.084 --> 01:10:38.806]  We got big headlines out about global government being established.
[01:10:39.447 --> 01:10:40.568]  We've got Gordon Brown
[01:10:41.528 --> 01:10:44.270]  There will be nowhere to run from the New World Order.
[01:10:44.311 --> 01:10:45.672]  That's another great writer at The Telegraph.
[01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:47.413]  Janet Daly.
[01:10:47.433 --> 01:10:48.334]  We have another one.
[01:10:48.374 --> 01:10:49.555]  Copenhagen Climate Summit.
[01:10:49.595 --> 01:10:52.718]  Plan for EU to police countries' emissions.
[01:10:53.519 --> 01:10:57.082]  And that's James Kirkup, if I think I'm pronouncing it right.
[01:10:57.342 --> 01:10:59.163]  So just great job over there at The Telegraph.
[01:10:59.524 --> 01:11:01.846]  And it's good to have James Dillingpole along with us, sir.
[01:11:01.886 --> 01:11:02.626]  Wonderful to have you.
[01:11:03.067 --> 01:11:04.068]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:12.812]  I tell ya, is it safe to say that the man-made global warming fraud has crashed and burned like the Hennenberg?
[01:11:13.693 --> 01:11:15.534]  I think we shouldn't count our chickens.
[01:11:15.654 --> 01:11:27.640]  Obviously, Christmas came early for you and me, first of all with Climategate, and second with the spectacular failure of the Copenhagen Carbon Fest.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:28.501]  Love it, love it.
[01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:30.862]  But I think we've got a long way to go.
[01:11:30.882 --> 01:11:34.024]  Because don't forget, we've got, what, 20 years
[01:11:35.242 --> 01:11:39.204]  Since the Warmists started putting about this story.
[01:11:39.224 --> 01:11:40.885]  You remember that the Rio conference?
[01:11:41.505 --> 01:11:41.886]  Yes.
[01:11:41.906 --> 01:11:44.487]  Was organized by your friend and mine, Maurice Strong.
[01:11:46.288 --> 01:11:58.935]  Now, we skeptics have got a long, a lot of catching up to do before we can undo all the damage which has already been done, all the lies and propaganda which is being put about by the mainstream media.
[01:12:00.439 --> 01:12:05.780]  All the mechanisms that have been put in place by Kyoto, for example, for carbon trading.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:10.441]  You've got the carbon trading floor set up in Chicago.
[01:12:10.921 --> 01:12:15.642]  You've got 10% owned by Goldman Sachs, for example.
[01:12:16.022 --> 01:12:27.584]  So you've got a lot of people out there who stand to make a lot of money out of this whole AGW thing, and they aren't going to surrender that money easily.
[01:12:29.585 --> 01:12:30.225]  Absolutely.
[01:12:30.265 --> 01:12:32.146]  We have different numbers.
[01:12:32.246 --> 01:12:35.627]  Some say over a hundred billion in the U.S.
[01:12:35.687 --> 01:12:42.289]  spent on this fraud and in buying off the scientists literally because you can't get funding unless you believe in the chicken little scenario.
[01:12:42.789 --> 01:12:48.591]  Any idea how much globally has been spent by governments and corporations pushing this takeover?
[01:12:49.369 --> 01:12:57.798]  All I know at the moment is that the global carbon trading market is currently worth about $120 billion.
[01:12:57.958 --> 01:13:01.762]  Now this, don't forget, is trading something that doesn't actually
[01:13:02.654 --> 01:13:04.555]  Exist really, but it's just thin air, isn't it?
[01:13:04.595 --> 01:13:06.856]  Carbon, CO2, we breathe it out.
[01:13:07.176 --> 01:13:16.479]  The idea that traders have created a mechanism whereby they can trade the stuff that we all exhale is Enron economics writ large.
[01:13:16.519 --> 01:13:24.122]  And funnily enough, the guy who invented CO2 trading was none other than Ken Lay, the guy who founded Enron.
[01:13:24.743 --> 01:13:27.704]  And this market, this false market, is
[01:13:28.942 --> 01:13:29.822]  Yes, I think so.
[01:13:50.202 --> 01:13:57.684]  So, you know, I mean, if America says no to cap and trade, that means that the bottom will fall out of the carbon trading market.
[01:13:58.064 --> 01:14:16.490]  And a lot of bad people, including Al Gore and I think Morris Strong, will end up losing a lot of money, which is why I think it's very much in everybody's interest that we urge, for example, the US Senate, when it votes next year, to vote out cap and trade, because that will be, I suspect,
[01:14:21.859 --> 01:14:22.520]  Absolutely.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:36.293]  Now, Gordo Brown, the unelected Prime Minister of England that no one can seem to get rid of, he is saying, oh, I'm writing the agreement that the industrialized nations have signed on, even if the third world got wise and bolted.
[01:14:37.314 --> 01:14:52.678]  That the West will give money to the IMF and World Bank I guess to dangle in front of the third world to sign on which of course conservative estimates have it at 10 million a year extra that'll starve to death who are living on that you know that that razor's edge between starvation and life.
[01:14:53.538 --> 01:14:56.318]  He's saying that they're just going to go ahead and implement it.
[01:14:56.718 --> 01:14:58.599]  Obama last week said look
[01:14:59.119 --> 01:15:00.080]  Command and control.
[01:15:00.681 --> 01:15:04.265]  I don't care if the Senate doesn't ratify or go along.
[01:15:04.365 --> 01:15:10.373]  I'm going to use the EPA to declare CO2 as some type of deadly nerve gas.
[01:15:12.135 --> 01:15:17.661]  So they're just openly coming out as dictatorial creatures and now they say the EU
[01:15:19.383 --> 01:15:26.486]  And break this down for us, the EU is going to now keep track of everyone, even if you don't sign on?
[01:15:26.766 --> 01:15:32.669]  They're going to be your minder and hold back your IMF World Bank dole if you don't go along with it?
[01:15:33.049 --> 01:15:44.654]  Well, the European Union, certainly the European Socialist Superstate, has been a very early adopter of the whole climate, the whole carbon trading mechanism.
[01:15:46.716 --> 01:16:00.321]  They are forcing all the member states to reduce their CO2 levels by X amount by 2020, and the various Libertad governments have mostly embraced this wholeheartedly.
[01:16:01.742 --> 01:16:05.603]  It's interesting that the European Union has form on this.
[01:16:06.443 --> 01:16:13.466]  Almost all the member states of the European Union, when on those rare occasions where their people
[01:16:13.993 --> 01:16:22.038]  I've had the chance to vote on the issue about whether or not they want to be part of this ever-increasing socialist super state.
[01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:24.080]  They always say no.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:26.381]  What does the European Union do?
[01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:37.288]  It always says, OK, we're just going to ignore the voters' requests, democratic requests, and we're going to carry on as usual and ride roughshod over their desires.
[01:16:37.768 --> 01:16:38.589]  This practice
[01:16:39.441 --> 01:16:40.222]  I don't know.
[01:16:51.901 --> 01:17:00.083]  That global warming is not man-made, and even if there is global warming going on, it is not catastrophic, never mind all scientific evidence.
[01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:18.707]  We are going to carry on with our programme as before, completely disregarding... I mean, I don't know how... presumably all your listeners are on-side, Alex, but the thing I noticed, blogging on this subject on the internet, is just how many people out there on the internet
[01:17:27.719 --> 01:17:28.780]  And that was my next point.
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:30.402]  I read ABC News.
[01:17:30.882 --> 01:17:33.345]  I read literally hundreds of the comments.
[01:17:33.385 --> 01:17:34.366]  I don't even really read the story.
[01:17:34.386 --> 01:17:39.692]  I go to the comments, and the mainstream media keeps shoveling the lie that everyone agrees that the Earth is warming.
[01:17:39.992 --> 01:17:42.675]  Everyone agrees that polar bears are all dying, which is a total lie.
[01:17:42.995 --> 01:17:52.861]  Everyone agrees we've got to have a global government and then literally 95% of the comments are saying we're sick of you liars and they're well thought out.
[01:17:53.061 --> 01:17:55.922]  They're writing their own little mini articles with links to facts.
[01:17:56.263 --> 01:17:57.924]  There is a rebellion.
[01:17:57.944 --> 01:18:00.825]  I think the mainstream media, is this what you're getting at?
[01:18:01.305 --> 01:18:07.169]  The mainstream media is committing seppuku by continuing the party line.
[01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:10.211]  Alex, your analysis is absolutely spot on.
[01:18:10.291 --> 01:18:18.033]  There is no question that this will be seen in the future when people analyse the death of the MSM.
[01:18:18.514 --> 01:18:21.315]  This will be the point where the MSM killed itself.
[01:18:21.735 --> 01:18:28.697]  Because it has refused to move with the times, it's refused to address the issues that are of concern to its readers.
[01:18:28.977 --> 01:18:37.300]  I mean, unless you buy the idea that every single person, or 95% as you say, of the people who use the internet are completely mad.
[01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:55.665]  Unless you buy that series, what you have to accept is that the interests of the people are not being served by, for example, the BBC, by pretty much every newspaper, like the New York Times, to the Times of London and so on.
[01:18:56.046 --> 01:18:57.687]  They are being completely ignored.
[01:18:58.107 --> 01:19:05.554]  All these newspapers, and of course the BBC as well, and of course most of the mainstream TV networks in the US, apart from possibly Fox,
[01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:10.422]  Uh, all these organizations employ environment correspondents.
[01:19:11.062 --> 01:19:19.565]  And all these so-called environment correspondents, they might as well, you know, be writing press releases for Greenpeace or Al Gore.
[01:19:19.905 --> 01:19:20.805]  They're lab dogs!
[01:19:21.705 --> 01:19:23.486]  They never question the scientific issues.
[01:19:23.506 --> 01:19:26.167]  They're not interested in finding out the truth.
[01:19:26.767 --> 01:19:34.489]  All they care about is towing a particular line, which is, the world is getting hotter, it's all our fault, we must spend more money now.
[01:19:35.951 --> 01:19:36.571]  Unbelievable.
[01:19:36.611 --> 01:19:40.333]  Let's continue then talking about the seppuku.
[01:19:40.353 --> 01:19:44.635]  That's when, I guess the Japanese term for when they commit suicide with a short sword.
[01:19:45.075 --> 01:19:49.077]  That is pretty much what the mainstream media has already got the knife in.
[01:19:49.097 --> 01:19:54.440]  They're now pulling it up into their ribcage, completing the act of seppuku.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.121]  And all I can say is more power to them.
[01:19:57.239 --> 01:19:59.421]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:00.662]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:20:01.202 --> 01:20:03.264]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[01:20:03.604 --> 01:20:06.626]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[01:20:07.166 --> 01:20:11.390]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:17.094]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[01:20:17.674 --> 01:20:21.918]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[01:20:22.198 --> 01:20:28.203]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[01:20:28.623 --> 01:20:29.885]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[01:20:30.285 --> 01:20:36.390]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:38.392]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:43.816]  Use Zeolife and OxySilver Hydrosol instead to detox and de-germ your body.
[01:20:44.136 --> 01:20:46.738]  Stop the shock of toxicity and preventable deaths.
[01:20:47.018 --> 01:20:49.160]  Call 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.501]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:20:51.842 --> 01:20:57.826]  Or visit zeolife.net and oxysilver.net and order your free report and package special.
[01:20:59.827 --> 01:21:03.472]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:03.873 --> 01:21:06.877]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:07.118 --> 01:21:08.520]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:11.882]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:11.902 --> 01:21:18.125]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:18.286 --> 01:21:23.308]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:23.328 --> 01:21:33.453]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:33.593 --> 01:21:35.695]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:35.935 --> 01:21:37.256]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:37.516 --> 01:21:39.798]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:41.819]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:42.099 --> 01:21:46.923]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:47.263 --> 01:21:52.027]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:21:58.996 --> 01:21:59.837]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:00.037 --> 01:22:05.382]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:05.562 --> 01:22:05.982]  I get it.
[01:22:06.102 --> 01:22:15.431]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:16.912]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:21.516]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[01:22:21.716 --> 01:22:23.397]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value?
[01:22:23.557 --> 01:22:25.378]  Or that your retirement would be secure?
[01:22:25.598 --> 01:22:28.859]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:28.979 --> 01:22:33.081]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:33.261 --> 01:22:34.821]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:34.861 --> 01:22:38.103]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:38.263 --> 01:22:42.445]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:42.645 --> 01:22:43.345]  You should, too.
[01:22:43.545 --> 01:22:44.505]  Find out what they know.

[01:22:47.747 --> 01:22:48.047]  Free.

[01:22:50.828 --> 01:22:51.088]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.128 --> 01:22:51.308]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:58.985 --> 01:23:00.886]  Is your computer running slowly?
[01:23:01.146 --> 01:23:02.567]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[01:23:02.887 --> 01:23:03.947]  Don't waste your money!
[01:23:04.107 --> 01:23:10.250]  Your computer could be infected with spyware, malware, viruses, registry errors, spam, and pop-ups.
[01:23:10.410 --> 01:23:11.850]  You don't need to buy a new computer.

[01:23:24.356 --> 01:23:25.976]  My computer was on its last leg.

[01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:09.893]  Daily Telegraph writer James Dillingpole is our guest.
[01:24:09.933 --> 01:24:11.114]  He's a best-selling author.
[01:24:12.273 --> 01:24:18.136]  Non-fiction books like How to Be Right, The Essential Guide to Making Left Liberals History, and Welcome to Obamaland.
[01:24:18.536 --> 01:24:20.237]  I've seen your future and it doesn't work.
[01:24:21.158 --> 01:24:23.919]  He writes for the Daily Telegraph and is a TV critic for The Spectator.
[01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:30.542]  He has a blog at the Daily Telegraph which he uses to disprove man-made climate change, jamesdillingpole.com.
[01:24:31.983 --> 01:24:43.448]  Well, I'm going to say how fantastic it's been for people like you and me, because we are the guys who are pushing out the truth, when the people who are the guardians of the truth are no longer doing their job.
[01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:12.325]  We used to rely on newspapers like the Times and so on to be telling us what's going on in the world, and instead their response seems to be to accuse us all of false consciousness, you know?
[01:25:12.346 --> 01:25:21.411]  If only the government spend a bit more educating us about global warming, then we'd see the truth, seems to be their line.
[01:25:21.751 --> 01:25:22.612]  And this ain't so!
[01:25:22.712 --> 01:25:27.195]  I've never come across a greater disjunct between what real people
[01:25:28.038 --> 01:25:33.242]  Think about something and watch what the government and the media and so on are telling them to think.
[01:25:33.303 --> 01:25:34.163]  It's extraordinary.
[01:25:34.243 --> 01:25:36.745]  I think we've got, you know, a divided world.
[01:25:37.346 --> 01:25:48.916]  It's like we're living in parallel universes, where on the one hand you've got big government, big oil, big business, the Green Movement, and on the other hand you've got ordinary people.
[01:25:49.196 --> 01:25:50.377]  We're living in different universes.
[01:25:52.608 --> 01:26:00.778]  That's a key point that you just raised, is that the controlled left always says, oh, you're working for the oil companies if you don't believe in man-made global warming.
[01:26:01.078 --> 01:26:07.405]  But then I go look at the main funders, it's big corporations, big oil, the stock markets, who want a new derivative.
[01:26:07.726 --> 01:26:10.068]  They don't care if taxes get passed on the average.
[01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:11.610]  We're good to go.
[01:26:41.290 --> 01:26:48.657]  Yeah, but that's because the people who are pushing AGW haven't got any arguments or facts on their side.
[01:26:48.957 --> 01:26:58.566]  So all they can do is resort to throwing out these accusations, for example, that deniers, so-called deniers, you know, that's to make us look like Holocaust deniers,
[01:26:59.526 --> 01:27:02.468]  We are sponsored by Big Oil.
[01:27:02.508 --> 01:27:11.974]  You know, any scientist who speaks out against man-made global warming, they instantly say, oh, well, he's in the pay of the carbon industry.
[01:27:12.274 --> 01:27:19.898]  Well, the fact is that the carbon industry and Big Oil moved out of denialism a very long time ago.
[01:27:19.918 --> 01:27:22.560]  They sponsor eco-conferences.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.182]  They're heavily exposed to the carbon trading market.
[01:27:27.162 --> 01:27:27.703]  They see
[01:27:28.363 --> 01:27:31.946]  They see ATW as a big opportunity to make money.
[01:27:31.986 --> 01:27:33.727]  That's how big companies operate.
[01:27:34.167 --> 01:27:38.731]  Of course they're not going to back the side that they think is not being championed.
[01:27:38.871 --> 01:27:47.977]  Wasn't it Ken Lay in the mid-1990s with Al Gore that had a bunch of meetings with oil company execs that explained to them that this was a giant scam, they should jump on board?
[01:27:47.997 --> 01:27:50.579]  That was exactly what Ken Lay said.
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:28:02.129]  People in the financial industries, they don't go in there because they care about Mother Nature or because they want to look after polar bears.
[01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:05.232]  They do it because, funnily enough, they want to make money.
[01:28:05.252 --> 01:28:09.837]  And whatever they see as the best way of making money is the means that they will choose.
[01:28:11.158 --> 01:28:13.540]  That's the nature of finance.
[01:28:14.093 --> 01:28:19.739]  But it doesn't mean to say that they've got rightness or truth on their side.
[01:28:19.759 --> 01:28:23.082]  They're just vultures picking over whatever they can.
[01:28:25.044 --> 01:28:26.245]  Well, they certainly are.
[01:28:26.625 --> 01:28:31.870]  How do you see the collapse of the mainstream media unrolling?
[01:28:32.291 --> 01:28:35.414]  I mean, if they are committing suicide, what is that process going to look like?
[01:28:36.178 --> 01:28:42.085]  I think it's going to be messy, because I think what they're going to do when they realise the mistake they've made, they are going to start fighting back.
[01:28:42.105 --> 01:28:43.267]  And we're already seeing this.
[01:28:43.747 --> 01:28:54.120]  Have you noticed, for example, how certain media organisations are now trying to ban people from linking to articles on news sites?
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:57.863]  That's where I was going next, and we're going to come back and talk about that.
[01:28:58.303 --> 01:29:04.970]  You've got Australia saying we're going to employ Chinese-style net censorship of political stuff we don't like.
[01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:08.092]  The government will decide off of a complaint system.
[01:29:08.633 --> 01:29:11.776]  We've got England talking about maybe we should restrict.
[01:29:11.816 --> 01:29:13.257]  We've got Canada, the U.S.
[01:29:13.297 --> 01:29:14.118]  now talking about it.
[01:29:14.498 --> 01:29:14.939]  I agree.
[01:29:14.979 --> 01:29:16.060]  They're going to try to shut us up.
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:16.981]  Oh, definitely.
[01:29:17.841 --> 01:29:38.202]  In the same way that they're trying to shut down the talk radio stations in America, under the Fairness Doctrine, this idea that because talk radio tends to favour the right rather than the left, because the right has got all the ideas and the left's got none whatsoever, and no one wants to listen to a libtard droning on about his stuff over here about the world.
[01:29:38.482 --> 01:29:39.243]  James, stay there!
[01:29:39.523 --> 01:29:40.324]  Gotta break again!
[01:29:40.344 --> 01:29:41.325]  We'll come right back!
[01:29:41.345 --> 01:29:41.806]  We're on the march.
[01:29:41.866 --> 01:29:42.907]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:42.967 --> 01:29:44.749]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.905 --> 01:30:01.507]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:01.907 --> 01:30:06.871]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:07.252 --> 01:30:08.993]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:09.293 --> 01:30:14.117]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:14.297 --> 01:30:15.198]  How much do you want?
[01:30:15.458 --> 01:30:16.219]  When do you want it?
[01:30:16.599 --> 01:30:18.200]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.301]  When will you need it?
[01:30:19.541 --> 01:30:21.622]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:21.742 --> 01:30:22.863]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:23.083 --> 01:30:24.424]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:24.624 --> 01:30:29.688]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:29.888 --> 01:30:33.090]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:36.933]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:37.293 --> 01:30:38.273]  How much will you need?
[01:30:38.513 --> 01:30:39.114]  We don't know.
[01:30:39.414 --> 01:30:40.314]  How much do you want?
[01:30:40.514 --> 01:30:41.254]  All you can get.
[01:30:41.454 --> 01:30:42.294]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:42.535 --> 01:30:45.295]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:45.595 --> 01:30:47.756]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:48.796]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:30:57.839 --> 01:31:01.841]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:31:01.961 --> 01:31:04.703]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:31:04.843 --> 01:31:06.084]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:31:06.104 --> 01:31:06.784]  It's very real.
[01:31:06.924 --> 01:31:09.046]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:31:09.166 --> 01:31:10.666]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:31:10.807 --> 01:31:15.149]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:31:34.198 --> 01:31:41.361]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:31:45.645 --> 01:31:47.566]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:31:57.702 --> 01:32:02.888]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:03.008 --> 01:32:07.373]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:07.533 --> 01:32:09.375]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:32:09.816 --> 01:32:11.157]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:32:11.438 --> 01:32:12.479]  There is a solution.
[01:32:12.699 --> 01:32:20.723]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:33:00.082 --> 01:33:05.224]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:05.905 --> 01:33:08.206]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:10.057 --> 01:33:21.925]  At PrisonPlanet.com, Steve Watson wrote a story last Thursday titled, Death of the Internet, Censorship Bills in UK, Australia, US Aim to Block Undesirable Websites.
[01:33:21.965 --> 01:33:22.686]  That's a quote.
[01:33:23.286 --> 01:33:29.530]  And we have direct links to the secret treaty that's been leaked that the White House confirms that they're secretly negotiating with the EU.
[01:33:30.131 --> 01:33:34.013]  We have links to the UK Digital Economy Bill, Clause 11.
[01:33:35.054 --> 01:33:38.677]  We have links to the public Chinese-style net censorship.
[01:33:38.697 --> 01:33:40.258]  That's what the government calls it in Australia.
[01:33:40.998 --> 01:33:46.502]  It's a ten-page article, or no, nine-page article, with links to all the documents.
[01:33:46.522 --> 01:33:47.343]  See, that's what we do.
[01:33:47.423 --> 01:33:53.527]  We link to all the facts, and the mainstream media engages in lies.
[01:33:53.847 --> 01:33:57.109]  We're going to go back to our amazing guest, author, researcher,
[01:33:58.070 --> 01:34:05.556]  Newspaper writer James Dillingpole, in just a moment, I want to encourage listeners to not procrastinate for Christmas.
[01:34:05.676 --> 01:34:11.981]  You can still give a gift of truth, a PrisonPlanet.tv membership as we fight the prison planet.
[01:34:12.682 --> 01:34:26.333]  All 20 plus of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book in e-book format, the last two hours of the radio show every day, we simulcast a full television show here with the radio for PrisonPlanet.tv members, the higher quality podcast with the commercials cut out,
[01:34:26.673 --> 01:34:27.134]  We're good to go.
[01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:47.498]  And six computers can simultaneously log on with the same username and passcode.
[01:34:47.518 --> 01:35:00.282]  So give yourself a Prison Planet membership and then give your friends and family, one or two people, I wouldn't give it to more because then it will lock you out if you all log on at the same time, the username and passcode for PrisonPlanet.tv and an e-card.
[01:35:00.622 --> 01:35:08.605]  So it's last minute shopping, give them a $5.95 trial membership or give them a year and save close to half off at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:08.645 --> 01:35:12.106]  And until the end of the year, we're offering my new film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:35:12.526 --> 01:35:20.432]  That exposes how the big banks and others are behind the phony green movement to take over, the entire climate scam fraud, this two-hour, 24-minute film.
[01:35:20.732 --> 01:35:26.736]  You can get it and get an Obama Joker t-shirt that the mainstream media here called to be banned.
[01:35:26.776 --> 01:35:30.499]  They said it should be illegal to criticize the president, literally on record.
[01:35:31.159 --> 01:35:37.744]  You get one of those shirts free when you get the DVD at InfoWars.com in the secure online video bookstore.
[01:35:38.064 --> 01:35:40.205]  Shopping cart and all the other books and videos that are there.
[01:35:40.465 --> 01:35:44.207]  You can also call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:35:44.507 --> 01:35:47.608]  And you also fund our operation against these people.
[01:35:47.849 --> 01:35:55.632]  We're not funded by the oil companies or by Al Gore and Occidental Petroleum or by Arm and Hammer's empire or by George Soros.
[01:35:55.692 --> 01:35:59.274]  We are funded by you, the listener, and our advertisers.
[01:35:59.714 --> 01:36:08.683]  And also support authors like James Dillingpole and go to his website jamesdillingpole.com or check out his articles at the Daily Telegraph.
[01:36:08.923 --> 01:36:23.838]  Okay, going back to our guest, long segment, I want to sit back and let you talk about whatever you think is most important, how they're implementing global governance by stealth through this carbon system, how they're saying we don't care if countries didn't sign on, we're going to start regulating and controlling you, but when we got cut off,
[01:36:24.398 --> 01:36:41.270]  You were talking about censorship, and how they're openly announcing how great it is to keep everyone safe, and there's been calls for Lord Monckton in major papers in England, that he's a climate tyrant, and that he should be charged with treason, literally.
[01:36:41.290 --> 01:36:46.133]  I mean, you cannot make this level of brazen tyranny up.
[01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.655]  So sir, please continue along those lines.
[01:36:49.116 --> 01:36:50.857]  Yeah, well I think that
[01:36:51.576 --> 01:36:56.380]  The AGW scam, the anthropogenic global warming scam, is the big one.
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:07.929]  You know, I mean, there are other problems in the world, you know, Obamacare and things like that, and Islamophascism obviously is a big, big problem, but I would say that the issue whose
[01:37:08.724 --> 01:37:12.927]  Evil creeping tentacles delve into ever deeper recesses of our lives.
[01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:21.373]  The really big one, the dangerous beast, is undoubtedly man-made global warming and the industry pushing this idea.
[01:37:21.833 --> 01:37:29.478]  Because it is an excuse to tax humanity on a scale never before envisaged.
[01:37:29.958 --> 01:37:38.364]  They are talking, the International Energy Agency reckons that to reduce man-made global warming to a suitable level
[01:37:38.832 --> 01:37:42.733]  It is going to cost $45 trillion.
[01:37:43.093 --> 01:37:46.174]  Now, the human mind cannot conceive even what a billion looks like.
[01:37:46.214 --> 01:37:50.115]  A trillion is considerably more than that.
[01:37:51.335 --> 01:37:53.476]  Where's this money going to come from and where's it going to go?
[01:37:53.536 --> 01:37:59.077]  Well, the place it's going to go is into the pockets of third world kleptocrat dictators.
[01:37:59.637 --> 01:38:10.480]  It's going to go into the pockets of people like Morris Strong, Al Gore, into the pockets of all the people who... Who we know has been caught with Saddam and others laundering aid money back to themselves.
[01:38:12.881 --> 01:38:17.322]  This scam is just unbelievable.
[01:38:17.442 --> 01:38:20.423]  It's done in the name of environmental righteousness.
[01:38:20.954 --> 01:38:35.391]  I think what half of these yoghurt-weaving crusty loons supporting the Green Movement don't realise is that the people they're in bed with are their most vicious ideological opposites.
[01:38:36.172 --> 01:38:38.474]  Who would have thought that people like
[01:38:39.523 --> 01:38:43.387]  Oh God, I mean, I don't know if you're familiar with this guy, George Monbiot, have you ever come across him?
[01:38:43.487 --> 01:38:48.453]  Oh, he openly calls for world government, carbon credit, uh, uh, ration cards.
[01:38:49.154 --> 01:38:50.055]  Yeah, that's the one.
[01:38:50.295 --> 01:38:54.860]  Well, but this guy, you know, I mean, for whatever his sad reasons, he wants, he wants this.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.981]  To bomb us all back to the agrarian... He's a control freak!
[01:38:58.342 --> 01:39:08.847]  Yeah, well, he wants us all to live in yurts and to travel around, you know, in coracles, you know, and so we don't have the wheel anymore, and maybe we'll probably even be banned from fire, we'll just have to sit around shivering in caves.
[01:39:09.367 --> 01:39:15.130]  Well, actually, you know, Europe has been banning in some countries and putting taxes on fireplaces and space heaters.
[01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:21.933]  Oh, yeah, I mean, I must say, one of my great pleasures in life is going to a pub, an English pub,
[01:39:22.193 --> 01:39:22.253]  Yes.
[01:39:22.353 --> 01:39:23.494]  And that puts out carbon too!
[01:39:40.199 --> 01:39:56.643]  Yeah, but I mean it is an odd scenario where you've got all these crazies going to the Copenhagen to protest in their polar bear costumes and stuff, and the people they're actually marching in support of are the most vicious form of capitalist you could possibly imagine.
[01:39:56.943 --> 01:40:05.185]  Now I believe in the capitalist system, but I believe in the capitalist system that favours the little man, that favours the kind of hard-working entrepreneur, small businessman.
[01:40:05.525 --> 01:40:07.946]  What I don't like is corporatism.
[01:40:08.306 --> 01:40:10.149]  It's a piratical system of looters!
[01:40:24.272 --> 01:40:26.534]  And this is exactly what's happening in the world now.
[01:40:26.715 --> 01:40:36.044]  Certain favoured big businesses which can afford to absorb the massive costs which are going to be imposed on us all by carbon trading and so on.
[01:40:36.425 --> 01:40:44.513]  These businesses are going to thrive, but people like you and me and your listeners are going to be screwed something rotten.
[01:40:44.881 --> 01:40:51.824]  And those big businesses will pay their cut to the Herman Goerings and Joseph Goebbels and Adolf Hitler's of today.
[01:40:51.844 --> 01:40:55.485]  Yeah, I don't think these analogies are inappropriate either.
[01:40:55.805 --> 01:41:02.388]  I mean, you know William Kristol who died recently, one of the founders of neoconservatism?
[01:41:02.808 --> 01:41:03.068]  Yes.
[01:41:03.108 --> 01:41:10.531]  He wasn't so interested in the great clash between, you know, the Free West and the Soviet Union.
[01:41:10.891 --> 01:41:17.613]  What interested him far more was the war between liberalism and, I suppose, what you'd call libertarianism.
[01:41:18.013 --> 01:41:26.155]  Because I think he sensed that this was a much more subtle and dangerous war that was going on, because a lot of people don't realize it's happening.
[01:41:26.275 --> 01:41:32.057]  Because, you know, there's no evil Soviet Empire trying to, you know, point its SS-20 at us anymore.
[01:41:32.337 --> 01:41:35.278]  People imagine that the great clash of civilizations is over.
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:51.445]  Actually, what's happened now is that we are fighting a guerrilla war of ideas against, it's for the right of the individual to enjoy his liberty versus big government which wants to take our liberty away from us.
[01:41:51.885 --> 01:41:58.247]  Which is allied with select global corporations that don't want a free market, they want a government that can deliver them monopolies.
[01:41:58.635 --> 01:41:59.436]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:59.756 --> 01:42:10.227]  And I suppose when one starts talking about using words like conspiracy, people on the liberal left say, aha, you're just another conspiracy freak, you're making all this stuff up.
[01:42:10.648 --> 01:42:12.610]  I would say it's only 50% a conspiracy in that
[01:42:14.424 --> 01:42:15.286]  I don't
[01:42:28.968 --> 01:42:34.652]  Just happen to have found a common theme whose ideals they share but for completely different reasons.
[01:42:34.692 --> 01:42:49.342]  So you've got the Greens who want us all to live in mud huts and stuff and restore the barter system and abandoned fun and we'll just eat raw leaves and give up meat and stuff.
[01:42:49.702 --> 01:42:55.646]  And then on the other hand, you've got the sinister business interests who just want to line their pockets.
[01:42:57.266 --> 01:43:02.769]  Couldn't be more different, but they have found a common cause, and that cause is ATW.
[01:43:03.069 --> 01:43:06.511]  Well, here's the Greek Prime Minister, Bilderberg, at Copenhagen.
[01:43:06.872 --> 01:43:09.153]  We are observing the birth of global governance.
[01:43:09.613 --> 01:43:11.494]  And you link through, he made these quotes.
[01:43:11.514 --> 01:43:15.096]  It's in the official Copenhagen record.
[01:43:15.156 --> 01:43:17.357]  We have Herman Van Rompuy.
[01:43:17.658 --> 01:43:18.398]  I could play the clip.
[01:43:18.698 --> 01:43:22.819]  Again, but I've played it literally 30, 40 times, saying this is the first year of global governance.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:29.642]  We have Ban Ki-moon in the New York Times, in an editorial he wrote, saying the Green Movement is the funding mechanism for global government.
[01:43:30.322 --> 01:43:31.542]  We have Al Gore saying it.
[01:43:31.582 --> 01:43:32.923]  We have Gordon Brown saying it.
[01:43:33.223 --> 01:43:47.828]  They're all admittedly setting it up, but then when we say, OK, we don't want your global government, and again, here's the London Telegraph or Daily Telegraph headline saying there'll be nowhere to run from the new world government.
[01:43:49.309 --> 01:43:59.562]  But again, they're trying to tell us that they're announcing this, but then we're not allowed to oppose it, as if we're so stupid they can announce global government, but then tell us it doesn't exist.
[01:43:59.642 --> 01:44:02.906]  What is the psychological tactic there of, say, Monbiot?
[01:44:03.206 --> 01:44:05.887]  I mean, just real fast, because you brought him up.
[01:44:06.328 --> 01:44:11.110]  Monbiot writes books, writes articles every few weeks, a new story.
[01:44:11.371 --> 01:44:16.493]  He signs petitions calling for a dictatorial world government to carry out environmental austerity.
[01:44:16.834 --> 01:44:22.196]  But then he writes articles attacking myself and others saying we're lunatics and none of this exists.
[01:44:22.437 --> 01:44:24.298]  I mean, does he think we're so stupid?
[01:44:24.518 --> 01:44:25.838]  He has such disrespect for us.
[01:44:25.878 --> 01:44:28.400]  I mean, what is the psychological tactic there?
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:31.541]  You know, in some ways, Alex, we are stupid.
[01:44:31.561 --> 01:44:42.083]  You know, just as in the 1930s, Hitler wrote this book called Mein Kampf, in which he stated explicitly exactly what his plan was.
[01:44:42.563 --> 01:44:43.524]  He hated the Jews.
[01:44:43.884 --> 01:44:44.984]  He hated the Slavs.
[01:44:45.304 --> 01:44:48.145]  He wanted to destroy the Slavic Intervention.
[01:44:48.465 --> 01:44:52.906]  He wanted a form of New World Order with him, Adolf Hitler, in charge.
[01:44:53.608 --> 01:44:54.928]  How do people respond to this?
[01:44:55.208 --> 01:45:00.790]  Oh, he's just a sad little German or Austrian in need of a bit more love, you know.
[01:45:02.130 --> 01:45:03.931]  We don't need to re-arm against this guy.
[01:45:03.971 --> 01:45:05.051]  It's all going to be okay.
[01:45:05.351 --> 01:45:07.071]  This is the power of wishful thinking.
[01:45:07.151 --> 01:45:11.232]  People do not want to deal with a reality that doesn't suit them.
[01:45:11.772 --> 01:45:16.194]  And I think it's the same with this AGW conspiracy now.
[01:45:16.874 --> 01:45:22.255]  As you say, people, you know, the Club of Rome, various people have been very explicit about this.
[01:45:22.788 --> 01:45:28.332]  And this is, of course, the classic way fascist movements operate.
[01:45:28.372 --> 01:45:33.655]  I don't know whether you've read Jonah Goldberg's rather excellent book, Liberal Fascism.
[01:45:34.355 --> 01:45:41.680]  He describes how, in order for fascist regimes to take over, they need a crisis.
[01:45:42.307 --> 01:45:46.009]  And if that crisis doesn't actually exist, they need to invent the crisis.
[01:45:46.029 --> 01:45:48.851]  I mean, this is what you've got Rahm Emanuel saying as well, haven't you?
[01:45:49.211 --> 01:45:49.351]  Yes.
[01:45:49.371 --> 01:45:51.672]  Let's make it an opportunity of this crisis.
[01:45:52.213 --> 01:46:10.443]  And of course, the idea that the world is going to end due to catastrophic man-made global warming is the best crisis you could ever imagine, which is why so many people have been gathering round this wonderful theme and working it up for all their worth.
[01:46:10.905 --> 01:46:12.666]  Because this is their excuse they need.
[01:46:12.686 --> 01:46:23.490]  You know, this crisis is so important that it is far too important to be left to the people of the world's constituent countries to vote on the issue.
[01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:27.832]  It's so important this must be taken away from the people and it must be
[01:46:28.391 --> 01:46:30.152]  It must be decided by experts.
[01:46:30.652 --> 01:46:32.352]  Experts from the United Nations.
[01:46:32.392 --> 01:46:36.153]  In future, they will take power, even over elected government.
[01:46:36.674 --> 01:46:49.697]  And notice how they always say, in all their talking points, whether it's David de Rothschild, or whether it's Ban Ki-moon, whether it's Al Gore or Gordon Brown, they always say, the time for talk and debate is over.
[01:46:50.078 --> 01:46:51.158]  This is the way it is.
[01:46:51.678 --> 01:46:52.659]  That's absolutely right.
[01:46:52.679 --> 01:46:56.081]  And again, that is a classic product of Nazism and Fascism.
[01:46:56.441 --> 01:46:57.662]  It's all about action.
[01:46:58.102 --> 01:46:58.822]  Action now.
[01:46:58.923 --> 01:47:04.226]  Because action means that you don't have to think about anything anymore.
[01:47:04.546 --> 01:47:19.995]  And of course, this is why Al Gore says in his Lenny Riefenstahl-type propaganda movie, An Inconvenient Truth, why he says that consensus has been reached, the science is settled.
[01:47:21.403 --> 01:47:33.491]  Once you do that, you instantly pull the rug from those who say, hang on, the debate isn't over, hang on, let's talk about this, hang on, there's a few more facts that are slowly beginning to emerge, hang on, it isn't settled at all.
[01:47:34.812 --> 01:47:41.336]  If you say, act now, we must act now, we must stop thinking, you are overriding these people, you are overriding the arguments.
[01:47:41.376 --> 01:47:42.377]  And of course, as we've agreed,
[01:47:42.887 --> 01:47:45.569]  The arguments are not in these people's favour.
[01:47:45.629 --> 01:47:51.114]  The facts are not in their favour, which is why they try and ride roughshod over those facts as quickly as they can.
[01:47:52.796 --> 01:47:54.036]  You're absolutely right.
[01:47:54.236 --> 01:47:57.437]  But again, I see the momentum beginning to shift against them.
[01:47:58.037 --> 01:48:02.558]  And before the last break, when we got cut off, you brought up Internet censorship.
[01:48:02.958 --> 01:48:05.239]  This is openly being announced globally.
[01:48:05.279 --> 01:48:10.960]  They're now even, Senator Jay Rockefeller has said, quote, we'd be better off never inventing the Internet.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:18.282]  They're now openly saying in Australia, oh, we're going to censor political views we don't like or people that leak things on WikiLeaks.
[01:48:18.962 --> 01:48:19.402]  We're now
[01:48:20.382 --> 01:48:28.723]  Well, there's two things that stay here.
[01:48:29.163 --> 01:48:41.426]  Alex, are you familiar with the work of the Italian Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci?
[01:48:41.926 --> 01:48:50.047]  Gramsci, of course, was the guy who said that in order for the left to win the political war, it must first win the cultural war.
[01:48:50.775 --> 01:48:51.936]  They had the long view of history.
[01:49:07.925 --> 01:49:18.227]  They took over the schools, they took over every aspect, I mean the music industry, pretty much every aspect of our culture is controlled by the liberal left.
[01:49:18.447 --> 01:49:26.029]  But I wouldn't even call them liberal left, they're just criminals that call themselves liberal so they can be the bleeding heart and you're the bad conservative.
[01:49:26.089 --> 01:49:31.810]  Well, call them what you will, the point is that up until very recently, until Al Gore invented the internet,
[01:49:33.592 --> 01:49:34.713]  Which I'm sure he's regretting now.
[01:49:35.033 --> 01:49:41.580]  Until Al Gore invented the internet, we didn't really have a way of expressing our dissent to all this.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:53.332]  And now this thing comes along, the internet, and it's fantastic because it means that people like you and me can express ourselves and tell our version of the truth, which is actually the real truth as it happens.
[01:49:55.270 --> 01:50:03.973]  Of course, how does the liberal left, how do the crazies respond to all this by trying to shut down this medium of free expression?
[01:50:04.294 --> 01:50:05.154]  They're going to try and do it.
[01:50:05.674 --> 01:50:11.957]  I don't think, and this is the one bit of hope I can offer to your listeners today, I don't think they can get away with it.
[01:50:12.077 --> 01:50:17.579]  If China can't do it, if China can't close down the internet, then I think nobody can.
[01:50:18.610 --> 01:50:21.412]  I agree, we've got to resist attempts to do so.
[01:50:21.452 --> 01:50:29.977]  Well they partially blockaded it, and it's a process, but then they just make the alternative information that much more in demand.
[01:50:30.017 --> 01:50:35.841]  But regardless, they're openly announcing their intention to, which shows everyone who these people really are.
[01:50:36.221 --> 01:50:36.401]  Yeah.
[01:50:36.681 --> 01:50:41.062]  Well, of course, already you've got some of the places on the internet which have been captured by the liberal left.
[01:50:41.142 --> 01:50:44.143]  I mean, are you familiar with the case about Wikipedia?
[01:50:44.743 --> 01:50:45.844]  Oh, it's a complete fraud!
[01:50:46.124 --> 01:50:47.644]  Half of what they've got about me.
[01:50:48.124 --> 01:50:48.625]  Well, stay there.
[01:50:48.665 --> 01:50:49.605]  Tell us about it when we get back.
[01:50:49.665 --> 01:50:50.625]  Final segment with our guest.
[01:50:50.965 --> 01:50:52.026]  Certainly we'll have to have him back.
[01:50:52.126 --> 01:50:54.166]  Very impressive information.
[01:50:54.386 --> 01:50:56.987]  But yeah, Wikipedia, it's a fraud.
[01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:02.470]  I think so.
[01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:22.788]  We're good to go.
[01:51:44.158 --> 01:51:44.398]  We're good.
[01:51:58.843 --> 01:52:00.103]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:00.143 --> 01:52:05.505]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:05.745 --> 01:52:10.346]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:10.747 --> 01:52:11.147]  It's true.
[01:52:11.227 --> 01:52:15.788]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:16.337 --> 01:52:21.021]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:21.561 --> 01:52:23.483]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:23.863 --> 01:52:28.466]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:28.667 --> 01:52:29.567]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:29.787 --> 01:52:32.570]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:36.172]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:36.493 --> 01:52:39.315]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:39.675 --> 01:52:41.556]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:41.897 --> 01:52:42.817]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.223]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:49.424 --> 01:52:55.191]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:55.532 --> 01:52:57.915]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:58.635 --> 01:53:00.296]  How would you feel with normal blood pressure?
[01:53:00.497 --> 01:53:03.499]  How would you feel with a normal cholesterol reading without the drugs?
[01:53:03.739 --> 01:53:05.501]  What if you could avoid bypass surgery?
[01:53:05.621 --> 01:53:07.983]  Would it not be nice to have your heart beat regularly again?
[01:53:08.163 --> 01:53:09.384]  To have a sex life again?
[01:53:09.684 --> 01:53:14.889]  All these benefits and more can be yours when your body heals itself with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:15.069 --> 01:53:16.810]  But please, don't take our word for it.

[01:53:40.465 --> 01:53:41.426]  The Controlled Leftoids.
[01:54:05.755 --> 01:54:13.647]  Using Bush's unpopularity and all the bad things he did boomeranged into power and are intensifying everything Bush did and adding a lot of new tyrannies in.
[01:54:14.847 --> 01:54:23.889]  And whenever you listen to the controlled left, all they talk about is how smart they are, and what geniuses they are, and how stupid everybody else is, and it's all just a bunch of prattle.
[01:54:23.989 --> 01:54:25.430]  I mean, they're a religious cult.
[01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:28.331]  And a great example of this is Wikipedia.
[01:54:28.731 --> 01:54:33.552]  They've got my name spelled wrong, almost all the info is wrong, and they won't let us change it.
[01:54:34.752 --> 01:54:36.533]  They use the worst photo of me they can.
[01:54:36.573 --> 01:54:38.373]  They're caught constantly in disinfo.
[01:54:38.713 --> 01:54:40.534]  You were getting into that, James Dillingpole.
[01:54:41.311 --> 01:54:51.416]  Yes, and disappointing, one of my favourite Wikipedia entries ever was the one that said I was voted the sexiest man alive by this girl school in Wiltshire in England.
[01:54:51.897 --> 01:54:54.098]  And somebody went and cancelled it out.
[01:54:54.298 --> 01:55:00.161]  But on a more sinister point, this guy William Connolly, have you heard of this guy?
[01:55:00.281 --> 01:55:00.561]  Yes.
[01:55:00.942 --> 01:55:07.185]  William Connolly was an officially appointed Wikipedia moderator.
[01:55:07.725 --> 01:55:10.707]  And this guy doctored or rewrote
[01:55:13.632 --> 01:55:17.114]  5,428 articles about global warming.
[01:55:17.454 --> 01:55:21.376]  So any article that didn't suit his version of events, i.e.
[01:55:21.496 --> 01:55:27.799]  the warmest version of events, he simply either destroyed or altered, to his point of view.
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:36.484]  This guy actually eliminated the medieval warm period, for example, on Wikipedia, which is the site, of course, everyone goes to these days for their information.
[01:55:37.076 --> 01:55:40.879]  So even the Internet isn't safe, and it's the same with Google.
[01:55:41.219 --> 01:55:48.384]  I mean, you're presumably familiar with how Google has been squashing references to Climategate.
[01:55:49.185 --> 01:55:49.465]  Yes.
[01:55:50.105 --> 01:55:59.512]  You know, when I first wrote about that story, I think within the first fortnight, Climategate had got something like 30 million Google hits.
[01:56:00.132 --> 01:56:03.055]  If you look now, it's gone down to something like 16 million.
[01:56:03.095 --> 01:56:03.575]  How can it have
[01:56:04.111 --> 01:56:07.274]  Fewer hits than it had two weeks ago.
[01:56:07.454 --> 01:56:08.795]  It's crazy.
[01:56:08.955 --> 01:56:13.639]  Well, we know Schmidt, the CEO of Google, openly says he wants a world government and world taxes.
[01:56:14.039 --> 01:56:14.519]  Is that right?
[01:56:14.719 --> 01:56:18.122]  He's not the same as Gavin Schmidt, is he?
[01:56:18.162 --> 01:56:19.063]  The climate guy.
[01:56:20.004 --> 01:56:25.708]  No, no, the head of Google is a huge supporter of Al Gore.
[01:56:26.469 --> 01:56:27.129]  Oh, no.
[01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:31.853]  Do you think we should all kill ourselves now before it gets any worse?
[01:56:32.398 --> 01:56:34.339]  Well then there's the hypocrisy of these guys.
[01:56:34.719 --> 01:56:44.162]  All the big climate change heads, like Bloomberg and Gore and Soros and of course Ted Turner, they have some of the biggest carbon footprints in the world.
[01:56:44.422 --> 01:56:45.803]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:56:45.843 --> 01:56:55.766]  I mean, look at... I mean, the guy in charge of the IPCC, Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, I don't know how long he's going to last with all the stuff that's been coming up about him.
[01:56:55.786 --> 01:56:56.647]  Have you been reading about that?
[01:56:58.153 --> 01:57:02.155]  Yeah, tell folks about how he gets steel mills shut down in England to move them to India.
[01:57:02.696 --> 01:57:05.117]  Oh, it's extraordinary.
[01:57:06.638 --> 01:57:22.286]  Rajendra Pachauri, the guy who's in charge of the IPCC, the supposedly neutral panel, which is in charge of giving us the accurate figures on how much the climate is changing and how much we need to spend to stop this disaster happening.
[01:57:22.666 --> 01:57:27.309]  This guy is in it up to the armpits in businesses,
[01:57:27.679 --> 01:57:30.520]  Which stand to make money out of carbon trading.
[01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:34.983]  So this guy is saying, oh, we need stiffer regulation on carbon.
[01:57:35.383 --> 01:57:39.885]  And on the other hand, he's making millions out of carbon trading.
[01:57:40.905 --> 01:57:48.669]  One of the things he managed to do was to, well, he's allied with this Indian conglomerate called Tata.
[01:57:49.169 --> 01:57:56.413]  And Tata owns this steel company in Britain, and it recently closed down this steel company.
[01:57:56.593 --> 01:57:56.873]  Why?
[01:57:57.621 --> 01:58:09.055]  Uh, because by shifting around, uh, its carbon credit, it could make over, I think, a billion pounds just, just for having closed down this business.
[01:58:09.522 --> 01:58:12.844]  James Dillingpole, I know you've got a lot of stuff to do.
[01:58:12.864 --> 01:58:13.725]  We've got a one-minute break.
[01:58:13.745 --> 01:58:24.093]  I'm going to ask you during the break if you can come back for five minutes and finish up on a few other issues dealing with this global takeover through the fake environmental movement.
[01:58:40.129 --> 01:58:41.991]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.652 --> 01:58:45.974]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.316 --> 01:58:52.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:53.500]  Number one.
[01:58:53.781 --> 01:58:56.943]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:57.224 --> 01:58:57.764]  Number two.
[01:58:58.064 --> 01:59:02.628]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:02.968 --> 01:59:03.409]  It's true.
[01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:08.253]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:08.573 --> 01:59:09.094]  Number 3.
[01:59:09.394 --> 01:59:12.677]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:12.977 --> 01:59:16.720]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:16.901 --> 01:59:17.441]  Number 4.
[01:59:17.681 --> 01:59:20.063]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:20.444 --> 01:59:23.847]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:24.127 --> 01:59:24.347]  Number 5.
[01:59:24.928 --> 01:59:28.851]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:29.072 --> 01:59:33.836]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:34.116 --> 01:59:38.139]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:59:44.943 --> 01:59:53.408]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:53.869 --> 01:59:56.190]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio.
[02:00:01.133 --> 02:00:01.774]  Big Brother.
[02:00:02.434 --> 02:00:03.415]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:04.191 --> 02:00:05.292]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:05.952 --> 02:00:06.773]  You want answers?
[02:00:07.533 --> 02:00:08.454]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:09.094 --> 02:00:12.717]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.277 --> 02:00:17.379]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:21.522]  We have now reached the second half of our radio broadcast.
[02:00:21.542 --> 02:00:28.507]  We're simulcasting the next two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv so you can watch us in living color and see all the documents and video clips.
[02:00:28.927 --> 02:00:29.747]  Coming up, CNN
[02:00:30.988 --> 02:00:37.531]  As the former head science advisor to Microsoft saying they need to terraform the planet to save us from global warming.
[02:00:37.551 --> 02:00:40.632]  Turns out Bill Gates has got the big patents on that.
[02:00:41.433 --> 02:00:42.773]  And we'll open the phones up as well.
[02:00:43.133 --> 02:00:45.134]  James Dillingpole is a best-selling author.
[02:00:45.514 --> 02:00:48.896]  He writes for the Daily Telegraph and the TV critic for The Spectator.
[02:00:49.156 --> 02:00:51.517]  JamesDillingpole.com is his website.
[02:00:52.017 --> 02:00:55.879]  And he's one of the leading people out there exposing the fraud of man-made global warming.
[02:00:56.599 --> 02:01:02.463]  Absolutely spot on, as they say over in England, and I say cheers to him with Christmas coming up.
[02:01:03.103 --> 02:01:10.667]  In the last four minutes we've got left in this segment, chronicling Climategate, that was only one blip that got a bunch of attention.
[02:01:11.068 --> 02:01:19.533]  We've had Ben Santer with the fraud at the UN, we've had Al Gore lying about carbon dioxide going up simultaneously with temperature.
[02:01:19.853 --> 02:01:21.694]  Chronicle some of the fraud of these people.
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:40.574]  Yeah, well one of the great defences offered by the warmists is that Climategate was an unimportant affair involving a few insignificant scientists at just one obscure establishment in the boggy fenlands of eastern England and it doesn't matter.
[02:01:41.015 --> 02:01:51.543]  The fact is that Climategate, what it did was confirm what a select band of brave scientists and bloggers and people have been saying all along, which is that the
[02:01:52.481 --> 02:01:55.422]  The whole system is rotten to the core.
[02:01:55.923 --> 02:02:09.609]  Now, these scientists exposed in the ClimateGate emails just also happen to be the small cabal of scientists who write the IPCC's papers on global warming.
[02:02:09.649 --> 02:02:11.250]  These guys are the lead authors.
[02:02:11.650 --> 02:02:16.352]  You know, one of the big names that keeps cropping up in those emails is Michael Mann.
[02:02:16.833 --> 02:02:19.774]  And Michael Mann is the American scientist
[02:02:20.461 --> 02:02:24.002]  Who invented the infamous hockey stick curve.
[02:02:24.382 --> 02:02:45.648]  That was the one, the great big curve that Al Gore, in an inconvenient truth, he shows this grasp of how global temperatures are rising and he has to mount on this kind of crane lifting device because the curve is so steep upwards that only with this crane can he rise to point it out and everyone in the audience laughs.
[02:02:46.112 --> 02:02:53.321]  The fact is that this graph, which was invented by Michael Mann to show how dramatically the world is heating up, has been...
[02:02:54.053 --> 02:03:01.237]  It's been proved wrong, not once but twice, by these two heroic scientists called McIntyre and McKittrick.
[02:03:01.677 --> 02:03:20.107]  And McIntyre and McKittrick have been on the case of the warmists for a very long time, and they've been using their – one of them's an economist, the other is a statistician – and what they've been doing is using their skills to analyse all the data that has been used by these warmist scientists, and they've proved
[02:03:20.532 --> 02:03:23.454]  Beyond doubt that these guys aren't cooking the books.
[02:03:23.594 --> 02:03:35.541]  They are fiddling with... And they called it a fraud and then the emails came out confirming exactly what they were saying with the fraudsters talking about them and how they had to suppress this information.
[02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:37.022]  That's exactly right.
[02:03:37.062 --> 02:03:46.307]  And it is fraud because what these scientists have been doing is skimming off millions and millions of dollars worth of funding
[02:03:46.784 --> 02:03:53.286]  And denying that funding to any scientist who disagreed with this meme about ATW.
[02:03:53.746 --> 02:03:55.347]  This is part of the problem.
[02:03:56.367 --> 02:04:03.069]  Those emails not only show them cooking the books, but they also show them bullying the opposition into silence.
[02:04:03.449 --> 02:04:10.392]  Trying to ensure that any journals that want to give work to dissenting scientists, that they don't do so.
[02:04:10.672 --> 02:04:12.872]  And if they try to do so, they want to get them shut down.
[02:04:12.892 --> 02:04:14.553]  Now this is completely wrong.
[02:04:14.953 --> 02:04:16.594]  This is not how science advances.
[02:04:17.155 --> 02:04:20.237]  Well, unfortunately, James Dillingpole, we are out of time.
[02:04:20.437 --> 02:04:22.038]  Thank you for spending so much time with us.
[02:04:22.298 --> 02:04:28.222]  Then there's the other frauds, like polar bears are all dying when their numbers are way up, saying they can't swim to school children.
[02:04:28.242 --> 02:04:33.365]  I mean, the frauds go on and on, and the key here is, they know it's a fraud.
[02:04:33.665 --> 02:04:34.666]  It's part of their agenda.
[02:04:34.906 --> 02:04:37.628]  Have a great Christmas, and thank you for spending so much time with us.
[02:04:37.768 --> 02:04:38.569]  Happy Christmas, Alex.
[02:04:38.609 --> 02:04:39.009]  Thanks a lot.
[02:04:39.409 --> 02:04:40.169]  You better take care.
[02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:41.970]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:42.250 --> 02:04:45.011]  We're going to come back and get into the rest of the story.
[02:04:45.732 --> 02:04:49.933]  Their power grab, where they openly say they want to terraform the planet.
[02:04:50.294 --> 02:04:53.735]  Then your phone calls and what's happening with the healthcare power grab.
[02:04:53.935 --> 02:04:54.395]  Stay with us.
[02:04:57.076 --> 02:04:59.678]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:00.098 --> 02:05:05.062]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:05.423 --> 02:05:07.184]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:07.484 --> 02:05:12.308]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:12.468 --> 02:05:13.389]  How much do you want?
[02:05:13.649 --> 02:05:14.390]  When do you want it?
[02:05:14.770 --> 02:05:16.371]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:16.652 --> 02:05:17.492]  When will you need it?
[02:05:17.732 --> 02:05:19.794]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:19.934 --> 02:05:21.035]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:21.275 --> 02:05:22.616]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:22.797 --> 02:05:27.881]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:28.061 --> 02:05:31.264]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:31.664 --> 02:05:35.127]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:35.467 --> 02:05:36.448]  How much will you need?
[02:05:36.688 --> 02:05:37.289]  We don't know.
[02:05:37.589 --> 02:05:38.509]  How much do you want?
[02:05:38.710 --> 02:05:39.430]  All you can get.
[02:05:39.630 --> 02:05:40.471]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:40.731 --> 02:05:43.493]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:43.774 --> 02:05:45.535]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:45.555 --> 02:05:46.476]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:05:56.075 --> 02:06:01.262]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:06:01.402 --> 02:06:05.768]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:06:05.928 --> 02:06:07.791]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:06:08.211 --> 02:06:09.573]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:06:09.833 --> 02:06:10.875]  There is a solution.
[02:06:11.095 --> 02:06:19.099]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:07:58.119 --> 02:08:04.144]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:04.744 --> 02:08:07.727]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.839 --> 02:08:19.024]  Obama Nation Care cleared its biggest hurdle in the Senate.
[02:08:19.625 --> 02:08:25.248]  It has one more hurdle, the full vote, coming up, they're saying, in the next three to four days.
[02:08:25.789 --> 02:08:27.910]  Then it goes to conference between the House and Senate.
[02:08:28.210 --> 02:08:32.853]  If it can get to conference, it has a 90% chance, and that's a dead reckoning.
[02:08:33.293 --> 02:08:33.954]  No one's sure.
[02:08:35.407 --> 02:08:42.333]  of passing and being on Obama's desk in the first couple weeks of 2010.
[02:08:44.054 --> 02:08:45.695]  So that is coming up.
[02:08:45.715 --> 02:08:49.278]  We're going to be, we're going to be breaking that down again.
[02:08:49.298 --> 02:08:52.741]  Headlines, Senate health bill passes major test.
[02:08:53.562 --> 02:08:56.224]  Health plans on collision course with the House.
[02:08:57.725 --> 02:08:58.846]  Also coming up,
[02:09:00.077 --> 02:09:07.340]  Senator says White House foes of health care bill are birthers, right-wingers, militias, Aryan groups.
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:10.341]  And that's what the MIAC and Homeland Security report says.
[02:09:10.381 --> 02:09:21.706]  It says if you don't like the Federal Reserve ripping you off, if you don't like Obama spending more money in the last year or less than all presidents before him combined, you are a danger to the country.
[02:09:23.746 --> 02:09:24.847]  And so that is coming up.
[02:09:25.802 --> 02:09:38.654]  Look, I want to just play, there's two parts, we're just going to play the first part from YouTube, of CNN and former Microsoft head talk of geoengineering the planet, part one of two, and Farid
[02:09:41.673 --> 02:09:59.006]  Zachariah talks with the former Chief Technology Officer of Microsoft, and they talk about how easy it is to put up these giant blimps up into the upper atmosphere, putting out sulfur dioxide to negate the effects of carbon dioxide.
[02:09:59.726 --> 02:10:03.549]  Now, out in the open, they're talking about geoengineering terraforming.
[02:10:05.070 --> 02:10:09.994]  The issue is, they're already using this.
[02:10:11.172 --> 02:10:13.793]  They've already got weather modification blimps up.
[02:10:13.873 --> 02:10:18.634]  In fact, I printed it last night and meant to give it to you this morning when I was here at like 10.
[02:10:19.135 --> 02:10:23.636]  The headline was, to find one of the articles, was UFO over Salt Lake.
[02:10:24.696 --> 02:10:25.977]  And it's a giant blimp.
[02:10:27.711 --> 02:10:32.534]  These blimps are on record flying around spraying the atmosphere and surveilling people.
[02:10:33.475 --> 02:10:40.179]  I have the Washington Post, New York Times, six, seven years ago when they announced they were putting these blimps up for multiple reasons.
[02:10:40.539 --> 02:10:43.621]  But then the local news, they call the Air Force and say, what is this?
[02:10:43.901 --> 02:10:44.822]  They go, we don't know.
[02:10:44.842 --> 02:10:47.343]  So the locals go, it's a flying saucer.
[02:10:48.064 --> 02:10:49.164]  Same thing over Russia.
[02:10:49.745 --> 02:10:52.747]  You can see the propellers on the thing.
[02:10:53.467 --> 02:10:55.529]  They use propellers even on the most high-tech blimps.
[02:10:56.070 --> 02:11:01.695]  You can see the blisters of solar panels on the sides to power it.
[02:11:01.955 --> 02:11:04.197]  These are unmanned giant blimps that stay up for years.
[02:11:04.898 --> 02:11:09.822]  So they announce they deploy them, then make it classified, and the public's like, Martians!
[02:11:10.283 --> 02:11:10.883]  Martians!
[02:11:11.284 --> 02:11:15.187]  No, it's surveillance and weather modification blimps.
[02:11:15.968 --> 02:11:21.993]  And I go on shows like Man Cow, nationally syndicated, and he makes fun of me, saying it doesn't exist, even though I give him the articles.
[02:11:22.714 --> 02:11:23.694]  I'm the crazy man.
[02:11:24.415 --> 02:11:28.819]  I'm the crazy man in psychology today, believing in this.
[02:11:29.179 --> 02:11:32.962]  Because I... In fact, just Google for everybody on TV right now.
[02:11:35.964 --> 02:11:38.566]  After you do UFO over Salt Lake, I printed it last night.
[02:11:38.586 --> 02:11:41.309]  It should be in the printer.
[02:11:41.329 --> 02:11:41.869]  Jaren's got the video.
[02:11:42.249 --> 02:11:42.850]  Google this.
[02:11:42.930 --> 02:11:44.852]  Homeland Security launches blimps.
[02:11:45.728 --> 02:11:46.948]  You'll get MSNBC.
[02:11:47.069 --> 02:11:47.389]  Watch.
[02:11:48.289 --> 02:11:51.390]  Homeland Security launches blimps.
[02:11:52.191 --> 02:11:58.293]  And you'll see a giant blimp being launched over DC, rising up in the photo from MSNBC.
[02:11:59.093 --> 02:12:00.474]  And literally hundreds of others.
[02:12:00.634 --> 02:12:03.415]  So, six, seven, eight years ago, they announced all this.
[02:12:03.495 --> 02:12:10.098]  Now the blimps are everywhere, and people are in Dallas, and people are in Salt Lake, and people are in Moscow going, Aliens!
[02:12:10.158 --> 02:12:10.678]  Aliens!
[02:12:13.052 --> 02:12:13.492]  There it is.
[02:12:13.652 --> 02:12:15.973]  UAVs, Satellites, Blimps, Homeland Security.
[02:12:16.553 --> 02:12:18.214]  That's from Homeland Security Newswire.
[02:12:18.654 --> 02:12:23.476]  Raytheon, Blimp, Ideal for Surveillance, Cruise Missions, Detection.
[02:12:26.758 --> 02:12:28.198]  So you guys found a bunch of them.
[02:12:29.539 --> 02:12:32.520]  But the point is, all of this is going on.
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:35.722]  Add Source MSNBC after it or Newsweek.
[02:12:37.342 --> 02:12:38.463]  Oh, you found MSNBC.
[02:12:38.623 --> 02:12:38.783]  Oh!
[02:12:39.723 --> 02:12:39.863]  Oh!
[02:12:40.724 --> 02:12:40.984]  Again.
[02:12:42.210 --> 02:12:42.990]  Super Blimps!
[02:12:43.411 --> 02:12:44.651]  That's not the same article.
[02:12:44.831 --> 02:12:46.192]  Eyes in the Sky for Homeland Security.
[02:12:46.512 --> 02:12:47.032]  Scroll down.
[02:12:48.452 --> 02:12:49.773]  They may have just taken the photo off.
[02:12:50.053 --> 02:12:51.334]  There's a bunch of them, is my point.
[02:12:52.294 --> 02:12:54.915]  So... And they do this.
[02:12:54.955 --> 02:12:57.236]  They announce a world government, then they say it doesn't exist.
[02:12:57.256 --> 02:12:58.216]  You're a kook if you talk about it.
[02:12:58.516 --> 02:13:03.018]  They announce... In 1992, a scientist won a Nobel Prize.
[02:13:03.038 --> 02:13:03.818]  Or was it 93?
[02:13:04.299 --> 02:13:07.880]  We've covered this, and I'm doing research the last few years on chemtrails for a film I'm making.
[02:13:10.353 --> 02:13:21.907]  And they admit that they have adding the jet fuel so that the air traffic controllers don't know, the pilots don't know, there's only three or four big manufacturers of the jet fuel for your mainline airports.
[02:13:22.668 --> 02:13:28.716]  It's added, it's designed to disperse nuclei for cloud formation, ammonium,
[02:13:31.403 --> 02:13:38.452]  Sulfur Dioxide, Barium Salts, Aluminum Dioxide, and it disperses it into the atmosphere.
[02:13:38.972 --> 02:13:44.939]  And so by 95 they launched tests, and suddenly people went, I never saw a condensation trail last more than a minute or two.
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:46.842]  That thing's been up there for five hours.
[02:13:47.583 --> 02:13:48.924]  It's turning into a cloud bank.
[02:13:48.944 --> 02:13:49.965]  Well, what's going on?
[02:13:51.121 --> 02:13:57.403]  And then the White House Science Czar comes out in his first speech to an AP meeting.
[02:13:57.844 --> 02:13:58.344]  There it is!
[02:13:58.844 --> 02:14:00.225]  Eyes in the sky for Homeland Security.
[02:14:00.265 --> 02:14:01.705]  The exact photo I told you about.
[02:14:01.725 --> 02:14:03.126]  That's from 2005.
[02:14:03.186 --> 02:14:07.187]  Homeland Security blimps and look at it over the Washington Monument.
[02:14:07.827 --> 02:14:09.728]  Blow that up for folks, please.
[02:14:10.008 --> 02:14:12.869]  But then I go on national radio shows and get made fun of!
[02:14:14.010 --> 02:14:16.531]  The public wants to believe it's flying saucers!
[02:14:18.191 --> 02:14:28.136]  In fact, since I'm already covering this, let's go ahead and I sent you several clips from ABC News and others where they're going, is it flying saucers?
[02:14:28.576 --> 02:14:29.797]  You know, is it aliens?
[02:14:30.277 --> 02:14:32.038]  And they got these things over Moscow.
[02:14:32.498 --> 02:14:36.821]  Now, when you watch the CNN piece, they show giant V-shaped blimps.
[02:14:37.301 --> 02:14:43.044]  And those are the really big ones that go up to 100,000 feet or higher and just hover around in circles.
[02:14:44.341 --> 02:14:48.103]  And it's so high up, you've got to have a telescope to look at them.
[02:14:49.423 --> 02:14:54.245]  I mean, literally, if I had the time, I could, they've got one over Dallas, it looks at all of Texas.
[02:14:54.565 --> 02:15:01.708]  I could drive up there on a clear day, scan around with it with a filter, because it's white, you've got to see it behind the background, with like a brown filter.
[02:15:02.409 --> 02:15:05.030]  I took astronomy in school and I own a couple telescopes.
[02:15:05.050 --> 02:15:07.331]  The point is, and I could look around and find them.
[02:15:08.379 --> 02:15:11.561]  And I could put it on the news and people would think it was a giant alien craft.
[02:15:11.641 --> 02:15:11.821]  No.
[02:15:12.301 --> 02:15:17.304]  But notice, it's the same thing they just saw over Moscow was one of the blimps taking off.
[02:15:18.144 --> 02:15:19.325]  And of course the Russians have them.
[02:15:19.505 --> 02:15:22.807]  But the really high-tech ones are V-shaped.
[02:15:23.407 --> 02:15:23.828]  Giant.
[02:15:23.888 --> 02:15:27.249]  And CNN shows these in the piece coming up.
[02:15:27.429 --> 02:15:27.970]  But first...
[02:15:29.175 --> 02:15:32.237]  That's one of the more primitive design ones of Homeland Security right there on screen.
[02:15:33.518 --> 02:15:34.539]  I sent you a bunch of clips.
[02:15:34.579 --> 02:15:46.587]  Just show one of the local news clips of Salt Lake City where they think, you know, the government won't say what it is, but is it aliens or is it a secret craft?
[02:15:46.707 --> 02:15:47.668]  It's a blimp!
[02:15:48.488 --> 02:15:49.469]  It's a blimp!
[02:15:50.290 --> 02:15:51.210]  It's a blimp!
[02:15:51.831 --> 02:15:53.312]  I'm not the conspiracy theorist.
[02:15:53.572 --> 02:15:54.413]  I have the facts.
[02:15:55.153 --> 02:15:57.595]  Why does the public believe it's aliens instead of a blimp?
[02:16:00.933 --> 02:16:01.253]  Here it is.
[02:16:01.333 --> 02:16:03.113]  Giant UFO over Salt Lake.
[02:16:03.133 --> 02:16:04.134]  This is one of the shorter clips.
[02:16:04.154 --> 02:16:05.254]  You can go watch longer ones.
[02:16:05.274 --> 02:16:05.974]  Go ahead and turn it up.
[02:16:09.235 --> 02:16:11.095]  What's hovering over Salt Lake City?
[02:16:11.175 --> 02:16:11.855]  Is it a rocket?
[02:16:11.895 --> 02:16:12.355]  A blimp?
[02:16:12.495 --> 02:16:13.355]  A UFO?
[02:16:14.095 --> 02:16:22.197]  A strange object seen in the skies has residents scratching their heads to craft floated overhead for several minutes before disappearing.
[02:16:22.777 --> 02:16:28.378]  Salt Lake air traffic controllers said their radar didn't pick up anything and they have no knowledge of the craft.
[02:16:29.434 --> 02:16:30.555]  Yeah, see, that's the issue.
[02:16:30.815 --> 02:16:34.477]  I mean, you look, it's a blimp with tail fins, looks like the Hennenberg.
[02:16:35.237 --> 02:16:37.999]  It's got propellers on it.
[02:16:38.519 --> 02:16:44.002]  I mean, this would be like if the Red Baron landed a biplane, a red biplane in front of your house.
[02:16:45.290 --> 02:16:48.531]  And the news came and showed it and said, we don't know what this craft is.
[02:16:49.292 --> 02:16:52.913]  It'd be like if a 777 landed at George W. Bush or H.W.
[02:16:52.933 --> 02:16:57.895]  Bush Airport in Houston and everyone ran on the tarmac saying, we don't know what this is.
[02:16:58.455 --> 02:17:00.436]  See, they treat you like you're morons.
[02:17:01.956 --> 02:17:11.800]  And there's longer, there's like a nine minute ABC newscast where they marvel and the government won't say what it is and maybe it's a UFO and the government said they didn't see anything.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:13.841]  They treat you like children.
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:20.243]  And just tell you it doesn't exist and you're seeing things when giant blimps are flying around.
[02:17:21.204 --> 02:17:31.190]  Now, I've looked into this story from a few years ago, and I looked into the Dallas stories, and clearly they have military bases there, they are launching blimps.
[02:17:32.291 --> 02:17:38.495]  And they're only seen when they launch, because when they go up to a hundred to a hundred and twenty thousand feet, they are tiny.
[02:17:40.953 --> 02:17:49.878]  People with telescopes, there's literally hundreds of videos online, where people with telescopes run around freaking out thinking they've found UFOs.
[02:17:50.418 --> 02:17:56.282]  And people with powerful telescopes, privately owned, keep seeing giant craft orbiting the Earth.
[02:17:56.582 --> 02:17:59.944]  And you look at the photos of them, it's giant space stations!
[02:17:59.964 --> 02:18:03.126]  90 plus percent of the space program in the U.S.
[02:18:03.186 --> 02:18:05.067]  and Russia has always been military.
[02:18:06.325 --> 02:18:07.606]  They've got space planes.
[02:18:07.906 --> 02:18:14.151]  I mean, you really think Virgin Galactic of Virgin Atlantic is the only group that has space planes?
[02:18:14.912 --> 02:18:26.582]  A private airline company has a couple spaceships and they launch missions into space for tourists, but the government doesn't have a space plane and NASA can't get one off the ground.
[02:18:26.622 --> 02:18:27.082]  Give me a break.
[02:18:27.422 --> 02:18:35.049]  Werner Von Braun in the 20s and 30s drew up the space shuttle in Germany when he was the head of the German and the Hitlerian program in the 30s.
[02:18:37.011 --> 02:18:38.613]  He was the head of NASA's program.
[02:18:38.873 --> 02:18:42.097]  That is an ancient tinker toy that you are shown.
[02:18:42.677 --> 02:18:45.640]  The reason they go with blimps is because they're so inexpensive.
[02:18:45.921 --> 02:18:56.633]  It's much cheaper to have surveillance blisters, infrared scanners, and face scanners, and license plate readers, and weather modification packages.
[02:18:57.862 --> 02:18:58.502]  On record!
[02:18:59.343 --> 02:18:59.803]  On record!
[02:18:59.843 --> 02:19:00.463]  Now when we come back
[02:19:29.943 --> 02:19:32.064]  They talk about chemtrail blimps.
[02:19:33.024 --> 02:19:40.606]  Chemtrail blimps with the former Chief Technology Officer of Microsoft about geoengineering from CNN.
[02:19:42.027 --> 02:19:46.008]  We're just going to come back, go right into this clip, then we'll go out to break.
[02:19:46.188 --> 02:19:50.350]  I'll come back on the other side of the bottom of the hour and comment on this.
[02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:54.151]  The full video is linked at InfoWars.com.
[02:19:56.511 --> 02:19:58.812]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[02:19:58.932 --> 02:20:00.652]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[02:20:00.812 --> 02:20:02.612]  NoMoreMortgage can change your life.
[02:20:02.672 --> 02:20:04.013]  We paid off all of our bills.
[02:20:04.093 --> 02:20:06.853]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[02:20:06.893 --> 02:20:12.475]  With NoMoreMortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[02:20:12.535 --> 02:20:14.135]  Even have more money left over each month?
[02:20:14.215 --> 02:20:16.776]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[02:20:16.816 --> 02:20:17.276]  NoMoreMortgage.
[02:20:19.336 --> 02:20:20.557]  Where have they been all of our life?
[02:20:20.617 --> 02:20:23.039]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[02:20:23.099 --> 02:20:26.762]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[02:20:27.002 --> 02:20:29.104]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.

[02:20:44.996 --> 02:20:45.496]  Call the number.
[02:20:49.039 --> 02:20:55.583]  Call now for your free CD, 800-578-6279.
[02:20:55.603 --> 02:20:55.923]  800-578-6279.
[02:20:56.544 --> 02:21:04.008]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:21:04.289 --> 02:21:10.072]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks, or the book for ten bucks.
[02:21:10.372 --> 02:21:13.034]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:21:13.314 --> 02:21:19.261]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:21:19.601 --> 02:21:23.466]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:21:23.686 --> 02:21:29.032]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:21:29.292 --> 02:21:31.132]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:21:31.372 --> 02:21:32.793]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:21:33.113 --> 02:21:35.373]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:21:35.653 --> 02:21:40.014]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:21:40.374 --> 02:21:43.755]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:21:44.075 --> 02:21:46.716]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:21:47.196 --> 02:21:48.616]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:21:49.096 --> 02:21:51.217]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:21:56.306 --> 02:22:06.053]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:22:06.333 --> 02:22:12.377]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:22:12.777 --> 02:22:21.623]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:22:22.003 --> 02:22:30.909]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:35.773]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:22:35.793 --> 02:22:37.334]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:37.594 --> 02:22:40.096]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:22:40.376 --> 02:22:41.878]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:43.701 --> 02:22:47.547]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.

[02:22:48.769 --> 02:22:49.130]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.678 --> 02:23:00.942]  We all know that the Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[02:23:44.035 --> 02:23:44.856]  That's GoBerkey.com today!
[02:23:54.024 --> 02:23:54.176]  Yeah.
[02:23:56.124 --> 02:24:02.829]  But I just can't see the world coming together to reduce CO2 emissions to the levels that will actually stop it.
[02:24:03.489 --> 02:24:14.797]  I can't see China or India doing it, which in and of itself would doom the project, and I really can't see Western countries making the kinds of drastic changes that would be required to cut CO2 emissions.
[02:24:15.337 --> 02:24:21.901]  And if we did, there is still lots of CO2 up in the atmosphere right now, and it will cause global warming anyway.
[02:24:22.722 --> 02:24:25.704]  All of which made me want to know, are there other approaches?
[02:24:26.144 --> 02:24:28.266]  Are there other strategies we might pursue?
[02:24:29.066 --> 02:24:47.339]  In that spirit, and in the wake of the Copenhagen Summit, here is a fascinating conversation, a fascinating set of ideas, concrete ideas, to solve the problem of global warming and energy without going down the Copenhagen-Kyoto route, or in addition to going down the Copenhagen-Kyoto route.
[02:24:47.959 --> 02:24:49.720]  Nathan Myhrvold.
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:52.122]  You've been looking into the issue of global warming.
[02:24:53.223 --> 02:24:56.105]  And you've brought all your expertise.
[02:24:56.125 --> 02:24:57.506]  I mean, you're a trained physicist.
[02:24:57.526 --> 02:25:00.788]  You spent years as the Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft.
[02:25:01.268 --> 02:25:03.910]  So you understand the science, the economics.
[02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:09.974]  What is it that you think when you look at what is going on, what was going on in Copenhagen?
[02:25:10.134 --> 02:25:14.217]  Here's the real problem, or one of the many aspects of the problem.
[02:25:14.277 --> 02:25:17.379]  When you emit CO2, a good fraction of it
[02:25:17.939 --> 02:25:22.163]  At least 20%, maybe even a little more, will stay for thousands of years.
[02:25:23.704 --> 02:25:27.447]  So, it's not like it goes up and then it can go away after a little bit.
[02:25:28.668 --> 02:25:36.275]  As we continue to emit CO2, it continues to make the problem worse, and then even if we stopped cold turkey, it'll be there for a long period of time.
[02:25:37.435 --> 02:25:43.700]  If you wanted a problem that was almost perfectly designed to be difficult for us to grapple with, this would be it.
[02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:47.302]  Because the cost is very high.
[02:25:48.783 --> 02:25:51.485]  The solution is going to require a lot of sacrifice.
[02:25:52.285 --> 02:25:56.928]  But the benefit is diffuse, and global, and way out in the future.
[02:25:57.609 --> 02:26:00.090]  And that's the kind of problem humans are bad at.
[02:26:00.691 --> 02:26:09.957]  And that's why you have a fundamental problem with the idea, the whole approach of limiting carbon emissions as the solution to global warming.
[02:26:09.977 --> 02:26:21.385]  Well, I think that you have to be an incredible optimist, or you have to believe that it's not a severe problem, to think that that's the only solution we should investigate right now.
[02:26:22.465 --> 02:26:42.029]  Okay, this building has fire extinguishers and a fire system, but it's probably unlikely there'll be a fire today It's a low probability event, but it's important enough that we really have to have all of this infrastructure and alarms and and firemen that will race up here and so forth because although
[02:26:44.016 --> 02:26:47.941]  Okay, we're going to come back and play the rest of it, but I want to just counter what you just heard.
[02:26:47.961 --> 02:26:57.752]  And for people watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, on the screen when they introduce him, they say, a new plan to save the world.
[02:26:59.013 --> 02:27:04.680]  So, they're now going from saying, the oceans may rise by a few inches,
[02:27:07.037 --> 02:27:18.601]  And a few polar bears might die, which is an extreme fraud, to putting out the visual idea, the asinine statement, that the planet may be destroyed.
[02:27:20.261 --> 02:27:22.322]  Ambitious plan to save the planet.
[02:27:23.983 --> 02:27:27.164]  On screen, they're saying, we are saving the planet.
[02:27:28.704 --> 02:27:33.506]  And then the Microsoft, former head of technology, says, but we have a plan.
[02:27:36.857 --> 02:27:45.219]  And when we come back, we're going to play that where they show these giant blimps to spray sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere.
[02:27:45.279 --> 02:28:00.784]  Now, how can the globalists, the UN, the United States, Britain, go and put up these blimps at the North and South Pole, as he says they're going to do, without asking the rest of the world?
[02:28:01.972 --> 02:28:08.959]  Also, what are these chemtrail devices, these aerosol devices, really going to do?
[02:28:09.199 --> 02:28:10.540]  He talks about tipping points.
[02:28:11.101 --> 02:28:23.093]  That's what the father of weather weapons, meteorologist Ben Livingston, who flooded Vietnam during the war, who created hurricanes, weakened hurricanes, now declassified, came on this show and explained to you.
[02:28:24.844 --> 02:28:26.866]  That it's tipping points they can manipulate.
[02:28:27.386 --> 02:28:36.733]  We already know there's a giant covert weather modification program that John P. Holder and the White House Science Czar now admits was just a test that they're now going operational.
[02:28:38.094 --> 02:28:39.935]  So see, they now have to introduce it to you.
[02:28:40.756 --> 02:28:51.804]  Now what they don't tell you up front is that Bill Gates, and let's search this during the break and show people when we come back, owns patents on hurricane-killing
[02:28:53.248 --> 02:28:56.371]  Systems or hurricane strengthening systems.
[02:28:56.411 --> 02:29:01.516]  The search would be Bill Gates patents hurricane weather control.
[02:29:02.857 --> 02:29:04.038]  I forget the exact headlines.
[02:29:04.719 --> 02:29:06.421]  He also has the patents on this.
[02:29:06.481 --> 02:29:07.962]  So this is his corporate minion.
[02:29:08.503 --> 02:29:11.626]  And of course, Microsoft itself is an NSA slash CIA front.
[02:29:11.926 --> 02:29:12.667]  So is IBM.
[02:29:12.707 --> 02:29:13.608]  That's come out on record.
[02:29:14.864 --> 02:29:16.566]  And so the globalists are going to play God.
[02:29:16.927 --> 02:29:18.409]  They're going to control your weather.
[02:29:18.749 --> 02:29:23.795]  HAARP, I've had the director of HAARP on, admitting that they can ignite the atmosphere with HAARP.
[02:29:25.558 --> 02:29:29.703]  Then during the break, the Air Force came on the line, griped at him and said, don't talk about that.
[02:29:29.983 --> 02:29:31.085]  John Harmon heard that.
[02:29:32.301 --> 02:29:33.822]  The guy running the show up in Minnesota.
[02:29:33.862 --> 02:29:34.683]  I'm down here in Austin.
[02:29:35.564 --> 02:29:37.285]  I ought to get John on to talk about that.
[02:29:37.746 --> 02:29:40.148]  I always talk about having him talk about it, but we should have him on.
[02:29:40.648 --> 02:29:44.471]  But the issue is, there is weather modification going on.
[02:29:44.491 --> 02:29:46.113]  We're going to come back and finish up with this.
[02:29:46.933 --> 02:29:47.854]  We're on the march.
[02:29:48.334 --> 02:29:49.936]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:50.856 --> 02:29:53.539]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:56.308 --> 02:30:00.550]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:01.470]  Number one.
[02:30:01.770 --> 02:30:04.931]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:05.212 --> 02:30:05.772]  Number two.
[02:30:06.052 --> 02:30:10.614]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:10.954 --> 02:30:11.394]  It's true.
[02:30:11.694 --> 02:30:16.256]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:16.556 --> 02:30:17.117]  Number 3.
[02:30:17.397 --> 02:30:20.680]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:20.981 --> 02:30:24.725]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:24.885 --> 02:30:25.445]  Number 4.
[02:30:25.686 --> 02:30:28.068]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:28.448 --> 02:30:31.852]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:32.132 --> 02:30:32.353]  Number 5.
[02:30:32.913 --> 02:30:36.834]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:37.054 --> 02:30:41.815]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:42.115 --> 02:30:46.136]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:46.277 --> 02:30:47.837]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:48.077 --> 02:30:52.678]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:30:57.967 --> 02:31:01.588]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:01.928 --> 02:31:10.049]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:10.789 --> 02:31:14.830]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:26.232]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:26.872 --> 02:31:35.880]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:36.381 --> 02:31:41.425]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:41.806 --> 02:31:49.012]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:49.312 --> 02:31:52.055]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:31:57.136 --> 02:32:00.799]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:01.159 --> 02:32:04.162]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:04.402 --> 02:32:09.186]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:32:09.206 --> 02:32:15.432]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:15.592 --> 02:32:17.834]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:18.374 --> 02:32:18.654]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:18.674 --> 02:32:19.095]  Bernanke?
[02:32:19.175 --> 02:32:19.956]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:19.976 --> 02:32:21.117]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:21.137 --> 02:32:23.379]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:37.273 --> 02:32:44.239]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:32:44.540 --> 02:32:53.668]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:33:03.900 --> 02:33:11.891]  Up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, you can read the headline, USA Today, Hurricane Calming Technology.
[02:33:12.612 --> 02:33:14.234]  Bill Gates has a plan.
[02:33:15.235 --> 02:33:21.404]  And then you find out he has all these weather control patents, because he's a government consortium front.
[02:33:23.416 --> 02:33:27.160]  A shadow government front, they give him all the patents they had decades ago.
[02:33:27.801 --> 02:33:32.005]  Everything he talks about, everything they have in these patents, is at least 30 years old.
[02:33:32.525 --> 02:33:36.850]  The Stanford Research Institute for the Navy Weapons Laboratory
[02:33:38.561 --> 02:33:42.705]  Had patents for doing exactly what they talk about here in 1967.
[02:33:43.026 --> 02:33:46.589]  That's now been declassified as four years ago.
[02:33:47.070 --> 02:34:01.364]  And I saw a story where the name Ben Livingston was in there as the father of weather weapons, how they flooded Vietnam when there were no clouds that were going to create them, how in the 40s he was the first guy to fly into typhoons that
[02:34:02.242 --> 02:34:07.637]  are over fifty miles an hour in some cases even faster two hundred miles an hour total
[02:34:10.239 --> 02:34:12.260]  Again, in the Pacific, the hurricanes get even more powerful.
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:13.341]  They call them typhoons.
[02:34:13.361 --> 02:34:14.182]  He flew into those.
[02:34:14.202 --> 02:34:15.583]  I mean, this guy's amazing.
[02:34:16.203 --> 02:34:17.884]  And we have that video interview, by the way, with him.
[02:34:17.904 --> 02:34:20.506]  He came to Austin at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:34:20.826 --> 02:34:22.007]  They had all of this.
[02:34:22.807 --> 02:34:24.789]  And so now they're introducing it to you.
[02:34:25.009 --> 02:34:26.250]  Oh, we can put blimps up!
[02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:28.631]  Oh, we've been testing with aircraft spraying!
[02:34:29.031 --> 02:34:29.151]  Oh!
[02:34:29.852 --> 02:34:32.153]  This is a giant program in full swing.
[02:34:32.794 --> 02:34:34.775]  And we know they're already manipulating the weather.
[02:34:35.275 --> 02:34:38.378]  And the issue is, they could create horrible
[02:34:39.332 --> 02:34:49.419]  catastrophic weather events with this, that's on record, and then tell you it's natural and scare everyone into submitting to global government.
[02:34:49.999 --> 02:34:52.981]  This is literally the elite playing God.
[02:34:54.162 --> 02:34:55.162]  That's what they're doing.
[02:34:55.202 --> 02:34:55.963]  That's what they want.
[02:34:55.983 --> 02:34:58.224]  That's why the Pentagon calls it owning the weather.
[02:34:58.725 --> 02:35:00.406]  And that's one of their declassified reports.
[02:35:00.506 --> 02:35:03.408]  Just Google, Pentagon report, owning the weather in 2025.
[02:35:04.308 --> 02:35:05.529]  They already own it, folks.
[02:35:05.849 --> 02:35:06.290]  Here it is.
[02:35:07.572 --> 02:35:08.113]  I don't know.
[02:35:23.379 --> 02:35:26.000]  We also don't know when we're going to get around to getting serious.
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:35.743]  So it seems to me that we need to have a plan B. We need to have a way to buy ourselves some time if it starts getting serious quickly.
[02:35:36.264 --> 02:35:38.484]  Now, what else could you do?
[02:35:38.965 --> 02:35:44.827]  And the answer is a topic called geoengineering, which is can we directly try to intervene?
[02:35:45.627 --> 02:35:50.909]  So to use an analogy, we all know we're supposed to eat right and exercise a lot.
[02:35:51.289 --> 02:35:57.192]  And if we did that, we would, a lot of heart disease, diabetes, tons of other diseases, we'd be better off.
[02:35:58.452 --> 02:35:59.633]  Turns out that's hard for people to do!
[02:36:00.953 --> 02:36:14.460]  And as a result, you also have interventions that you would do, like heart surgery, that you might do to get a stent put in, or to have a bypass operation, because if you neglect the problem long enough, that's what you have to do.
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:16.881]  Well, the equivalent of that surgery, in this case,
[02:36:18.351 --> 02:36:19.832]  Our means to directly intervene.
[02:36:20.092 --> 02:36:23.694]  Now one approach is to take the CO2 and suck it out of the atmosphere.
[02:36:23.934 --> 02:36:24.715]  Now how do you do that?
[02:36:24.955 --> 02:36:27.676]  We return actually to Benjamin Franklin.
[02:36:29.738 --> 02:36:34.460]  In 1783, there's a volcano called Laki in Iceland.
[02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:35.781]  I've been there to visit it.
[02:36:35.801 --> 02:36:37.462]  That erupted.
[02:36:38.483 --> 02:36:43.085]  Causing a tremendous winter in 1784 in the Northern Hemisphere.
[02:36:44.266 --> 02:36:46.087]  So Benjamin Franklin gives a paper.
[02:36:46.367 --> 02:36:47.408]  He says it was a volcano.
[02:36:48.992 --> 02:36:54.414]  Well, we know today through lots of... How did he figure that out?
[02:36:54.434 --> 02:37:06.497]  He has a great, it's a wonderful thing, I wish I had the text to read here because it's in this sort of quaint English of that era, where he says that it blocked the many rays of the sun.
[02:37:07.924 --> 02:37:11.165]  And so far as we know today, Ben was right!
[02:37:12.105 --> 02:37:16.966]  And we know this because in 1991, a Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines exploded.
[02:37:17.406 --> 02:37:28.048]  There's been lots of volcanoes since then, but a very large volcano that's got a tremendous amount of power will put a lot of gases and particles into the very upper atmosphere, the stratosphere.
[02:37:28.748 --> 02:37:29.769]  Mount Pinatubo did.
[02:37:30.549 --> 02:37:36.130]  It caused global temperatures to drop by about one degree Fahrenheit for about a year, year and a half afterwards.
[02:37:37.091 --> 02:37:42.197]  Now, that's interesting because that's about the amount of global warming that we have today.
[02:37:42.537 --> 02:37:45.560]  So if you could just have a Mount Pinatubo every year?
[02:37:45.580 --> 02:37:48.564]  A Mount Pinatubo on demand would do it.
[02:37:49.284 --> 02:37:50.065]  And what is it doing?
[02:37:50.105 --> 02:37:51.427]  What is the chemical process?
[02:37:51.567 --> 02:37:55.191]  It's spewing sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere.
[02:37:55.451 --> 02:37:55.932]  Why is that?
[02:37:58.634 --> 02:38:03.697]  When you have small aerosol particles, light will scatter off of them.
[02:38:04.698 --> 02:38:09.240]  That scattering is why, one range of that scattering is why the sky is blue.
[02:38:10.141 --> 02:38:13.182]  Another range of that scattering is why milk is white, actually.
[02:38:13.362 --> 02:38:15.884]  So it turns out sulfur dioxide is very good at scattering light.
[02:38:16.984 --> 02:38:26.590]  And if you have sulfur dioxide, it's what gives the rotten egg smell in part, or that in hydrogen sulfides, at Yellowstone or other places you have geysers.
[02:38:29.099 --> 02:38:31.161]  Enough of those particles will scatter light.
[02:38:31.542 --> 02:38:43.615]  If you had a system for delivering sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere, you could easily dim the sun by 1% and even do it in a way that wouldn't be visible.
[02:38:44.396 --> 02:38:49.041]  So how do you pump sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere on demand?
[02:38:49.321 --> 02:38:55.664]  The first things that you think of, like, oh, let's load it into 747s and carry it up, are way too expensive.
[02:38:56.324 --> 02:38:58.505]  So you need a cheap way to get a lot of stuff up there.
[02:38:59.266 --> 02:39:02.207]  So we set out to invent something like that.
[02:39:02.287 --> 02:39:04.508]  We've come up with, actually, a couple ways to do it.
[02:39:04.668 --> 02:39:07.690]  But I'll tell you the simplest one, which is you run a hose to the sky.
[02:39:09.310 --> 02:39:24.900]  It sounds nuts, but you take a hose, you suspend it on a series of balloons, helium balloons, you want to run it 25 kilometers up, because that takes you up into the stratosphere.
[02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:26.481]  25 kilometer garden hose?
[02:39:27.141 --> 02:39:28.562]  Now that's the interesting part.
[02:39:28.742 --> 02:39:31.144]  If you go through a calculation of how much you need,
[02:39:32.684 --> 02:39:37.226]  In our best scheme, it's like a fat garden hose.
[02:39:37.867 --> 02:39:41.748]  The total amount of rate that you're pumping is about 30 gallons a minute.
[02:39:42.728 --> 02:39:44.789]  That's less than a swimming pool pump.
[02:39:46.170 --> 02:39:53.633]  So it's actually a very manageable sized problem once you come up with this idea that you put the stuff up there.
[02:39:54.453 --> 02:40:01.056]  The best place to put it is in very high latitudes, that's very far north, or in the southern hemisphere, very far south.
[02:40:01.736 --> 02:40:07.418]  So, northern Canada, Russia, some place like that, that's up 60-70 degrees north.
[02:40:07.718 --> 02:40:18.762]  So run one of these garden hoses at the North Pole, basically, one at the South Pole, turn them on every year, and you've solved the problem of global warming?
[02:40:19.950 --> 02:40:24.012]  Well, we've done a series of computer simulations that tell us exactly that.
[02:40:24.792 --> 02:40:37.598]  That one of these units at 60 to 70 North, with a set of assumptions about how you put the aerosol up there, would negate global warming as we have it today.
[02:40:38.639 --> 02:40:41.420]  And by putting it up there, would particularly protect the Arctic.
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:46.823]  And once you protect the Arctic, you shut off a bunch of these potential tipping point mechanisms.
[02:40:48.147 --> 02:40:59.611]  Once you cool the Arctic, our simulations show that in fact you draw enough heat from the rest of the hemisphere that you bring the rest of the hemisphere into line, and you don't have any severe dislocations of the weather.
[02:41:00.391 --> 02:41:15.977]  And it's worth pointing out, your stuff is all computer simulations, but of course so are the predictions that the IPCC model uses to predict very bad stuff happening, so if we believe those computer simulations, there's no reason to assume yours are wrong.
[02:41:16.454 --> 02:41:17.895]  Well, I think, yes.
[02:41:18.355 --> 02:41:23.618]  We use the same kind of computer simulations, the same sort of software, with the same sort of assumptions.
[02:41:24.178 --> 02:41:30.982]  Now, neither one of them is perfect, but it gives us confidence, and at least as much confidence as we would have in the other directions.
[02:41:31.082 --> 02:41:36.866]  Now, of course, before you really deploy it, you'd want to run some more simulations, and you'd want to do some small-scale experiments.
[02:41:36.886 --> 02:41:44.490]  There's a lot of things to do to sort of responsibly build the full case, but from what we can tell, this is an idea that has incredible promise.
[02:41:44.850 --> 02:41:47.691]  Now, are people, are governments knocking on your doors?
[02:41:49.031 --> 02:41:50.891]  So, uh, not so far!
[02:41:51.792 --> 02:41:58.673]  And we will be back with Nathan Myhrvold, more on global warming, the future of energy, and a way to power the whole world.
[02:41:59.013 --> 02:41:59.434]  Okay.
[02:42:00.634 --> 02:42:01.234]  That's enough.
[02:42:01.874 --> 02:42:11.617]  You can watch part two at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, or you can go directly to YouTube and pull the cliff up.
[02:42:11.837 --> 02:42:12.297]  It's CNN, a
[02:42:13.868 --> 02:42:17.409]  Former Microsoft head, talk of geoengineering the planet.
[02:42:19.309 --> 02:42:26.891]  Okay, I wrote some notes during that, and I want to go over those notes, then we're going to give the number out, open the phones up, and get into the government grab of health care.
[02:42:28.311 --> 02:42:30.272]  And I'm not taking these in any particular order.
[02:42:32.012 --> 02:42:39.874]  This is their way, through the fear of global warming, to not just tax you, but set up a global agreement for weather modification.
[02:42:40.434 --> 02:42:41.835]  And there's actually a 1970s UN treaty
[02:42:44.639 --> 02:42:45.300]  That the U.S.
[02:42:45.340 --> 02:42:48.423]  and others signed on to on weather weapons.
[02:42:49.163 --> 02:42:56.450]  So see, while they've been telling you none of this existed, now being declassified incrementally, because they're getting ready to go public with it.
[02:42:57.771 --> 02:43:03.837]  While they've been busy manipulating and testing all of this, they now tell you that they're just now getting around to testing it.
[02:43:04.858 --> 02:43:09.102]  So they want to set up a global weather bureau, and Bill Gates has been given
[02:43:10.309 --> 02:43:19.675]  All of the secret technologies, because it's now declassified, five years ago, four and a half years ago, for sulfur dioxide from aircraft, sulfur dioxide from blimps.
[02:43:20.175 --> 02:43:21.116]  We have the documents.
[02:43:21.536 --> 02:43:23.357]  Associated Press, you name it, reported on it.
[02:43:23.938 --> 02:43:26.219]  I just said, oh look, there's Ben Livingston.
[02:43:26.239 --> 02:43:27.460]  They say he's the main inventor.
[02:43:27.960 --> 02:43:28.540]  Call him up.
[02:43:29.121 --> 02:43:30.682]  Yeah, we control hurricanes.
[02:43:30.722 --> 02:43:31.622]  It was all certified.
[02:43:31.903 --> 02:43:33.884]  I don't know why they let these hurricanes do what they did.
[02:43:35.270 --> 02:43:37.011]  I talked to other meteorologists and experts.
[02:43:37.031 --> 02:43:40.712]  They go, yeah, these hurricanes like Katrina don't act like hurricanes normally do.
[02:43:41.352 --> 02:43:49.034]  You got double eyes in some of them, strange behavior, aircraft seen spraying while this is going on.
[02:43:49.074 --> 02:43:50.514]  They can strengthen them or weaken them.
[02:43:51.995 --> 02:43:54.976]  So you have a global weather bureau they openly want to set up.
[02:43:55.016 --> 02:43:56.116]  Bill Gates has now said this.
[02:43:57.116 --> 02:44:00.177]  We predicted they would do this years ago because we know how they operate.
[02:44:00.497 --> 02:44:01.517]  We have enough info.
[02:44:01.797 --> 02:44:02.797]  We understand their program.
[02:44:03.117 --> 02:44:05.398]  They create the crisis, whether real or manufactured.
[02:44:05.718 --> 02:44:06.698]  They offer the solution.
[02:44:09.238 --> 02:44:09.959]  It goes on.
[02:44:10.259 --> 02:44:13.479]  Again, they sell it all with climate fear.
[02:44:14.199 --> 02:44:22.361]  The public thinks, well, if they're going to put blimps up in the upper atmosphere and aircraft and spray us, why, it must be real if the government's doing this.
[02:44:24.522 --> 02:44:30.451]  It's a giant corporate boondoggle, a new global weather bureau that we'll spend hundreds of billions a year on.
[02:44:31.152 --> 02:44:33.196]  Already going on secretly, now being declassified.
[02:44:34.478 --> 02:44:38.123]  It takes global agreements to get this set up, which is what they want, globalization.
[02:44:39.522 --> 02:44:44.626]  It can also cover what they're doing and cover all their weather weapon programs that are happening.
[02:44:45.047 --> 02:44:54.714]  NASA reported three years ago that the Earth in the last decade has become 20% darker than in the 100 years it was accurately measured before that.
[02:44:55.195 --> 02:44:58.678]  Because there's all this new hazy cloud cover formed by the chemtrails.
[02:44:59.038 --> 02:45:01.940]  That's just the low-altitude aerosol spraying.
[02:45:02.220 --> 02:45:06.344]  When I use chemtrail, that's the colloquial common term for it.
[02:45:07.230 --> 02:45:17.233]  They have literally thousands of documents that he classified this year, where Department of Energy, Department of the Army, Department of the Air Force, they're just all out spraying globally.
[02:45:17.573 --> 02:45:20.134]  And it's all black budget and secret how much they're spending.
[02:45:20.534 --> 02:45:23.275]  It's a giant program, manipulating the weather.
[02:45:23.855 --> 02:45:25.775]  The Earth is now 20% darker at least.
[02:45:27.236 --> 02:45:30.937]  I mean, we're living in the middle of Buck Rogers, folks, but the general public doesn't understand it.
[02:45:36.164 --> 02:45:42.092]  He says, yes, we'll use the same software that we've used for the global warming models.
[02:45:42.512 --> 02:45:47.859]  All centralized, fraud-driven, by United Nations groups.
[02:45:48.340 --> 02:45:49.782]  So, more scams.
[02:45:49.822 --> 02:45:51.284]  You'll never know what they're really doing.
[02:45:51.704 --> 02:45:54.168]  It's a cover for their weather weapons and weather manipulation.
[02:45:55.899 --> 02:45:58.402]  And then they say, oh, well, we'll test this on a small scale.
[02:45:58.422 --> 02:46:02.587]  They've already been testing on a giant scale with HAARP, and that's just one location.
[02:46:02.607 --> 02:46:14.900]  They've got them in Europe on record, smaller stations all over the country, where the Pentagon admits they're testing it and ionizing the atmosphere along with the barium salts, aluminum dioxide, sulfur dioxide they're projecting.
[02:46:15.441 --> 02:46:19.223]  When he said these things reflect back into space, that's only a small part of it.
[02:46:19.544 --> 02:46:22.245]  They also form nuclei for clouds.
[02:46:22.325 --> 02:46:26.468]  That's the main driver, according to the climatologist we've interviewed here.
[02:46:27.749 --> 02:46:28.729]  It's the nuclei.
[02:46:29.270 --> 02:46:33.973]  The potash, other things that we put into the atmosphere form nuclei.
[02:46:34.293 --> 02:46:36.014]  Smokestacks, forest fires.
[02:46:36.594 --> 02:46:39.116]  But even more importantly, space dust.
[02:46:39.616 --> 02:46:42.378]  Micrometeors coming in by the millions every day.
[02:46:42.678 --> 02:46:43.819]  That's a conservative estimate.
[02:46:44.239 --> 02:46:52.220]  Those are breaking up in the atmosphere, forming nuclei that water particles freeze onto in the upper atmosphere, becoming larger, micro-hail.
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:59.062]  Then, as it comes into the lower atmosphere, it heats back up, creating water vapor that you know as clouds.
[02:47:00.202 --> 02:47:00.942]  You understanding this?
[02:47:02.482 --> 02:47:13.044]  So, when they say, test on a small scale, there's no way to test these technologies on a small scale and know what it's going to do in the giant, tera-scale, or planetary, geo-scale.
[02:47:13.979 --> 02:47:14.300]  Okay?
[02:47:15.482 --> 02:47:17.245]  So, test on the small scale.
[02:47:18.247 --> 02:47:18.868]  What a fraud!
[02:47:19.068 --> 02:47:20.891]  They're already testing on a giant scale.
[02:47:21.232 --> 02:47:22.594]  You just weren't supposed to know about it.
[02:47:22.895 --> 02:47:24.157]  Now they're going public with it!
[02:47:24.998 --> 02:47:34.587]  Namely because they want to publicly use it and since 1995, researchers, meteorologists, scientists, people have gone up in aircraft behind the chemtrails.
[02:47:34.847 --> 02:47:38.131]  They said it's barium salts, aluminum dioxide, sulfur dioxide.
[02:47:39.051 --> 02:47:40.773]  It's being dispersed in jet fuel.
[02:47:40.993 --> 02:47:41.894]  We've done studies.
[02:47:42.134 --> 02:47:44.597]  You could clearly do this and have it disperse the nuclei.
[02:47:45.595 --> 02:48:03.961]  Then John P. Holdren, White House Science Czar, who also wrote the book Ecoscience, calling for putting stuff in the water to sterilize you and your family, and he wants a planetary government, read his own book, he comes out and says, yeah, we got jets that are going to spray the clouds and create clouds to protect you from global warming.
[02:48:05.236 --> 02:48:20.471]  Three years ago, government-approved textbooks nationwide in public schools, two of them came out for 7th and 8th graders, used all over the country, where they teach the kids the government is spraying trails to create sunscreen to protect you.
[02:48:20.891 --> 02:48:26.497]  So see, they're teaching the kids, it's like Time Magazine for kids, in two different issues.
[02:48:28.792 --> 02:48:31.473]  One five years ago, one three years ago, that I know of.
[02:48:32.113 --> 02:48:32.713]  I was sent this.
[02:48:32.733 --> 02:48:34.933]  They have Time Magazine free for kids in school.
[02:48:35.133 --> 02:48:36.193]  Federal government pays for it.
[02:48:37.754 --> 02:48:39.914]  And it says, your parents don't understand the future.
[02:48:39.954 --> 02:48:41.554]  They're old-fashioned, but you're cool.
[02:48:41.614 --> 02:48:44.395]  You're gonna take a microchip that you're gonna buy and sell with.
[02:48:44.755 --> 02:48:46.675]  And then no one will be able to take your identity.
[02:48:47.035 --> 02:48:48.996]  See, they're teaching your kids they're chemtrailing.
[02:48:49.276 --> 02:48:51.236]  They're teaching your kids that microchips are good.
[02:48:51.456 --> 02:48:53.236]  They're teaching your kids global warming's real.
[02:48:53.436 --> 02:48:54.717]  And to come home and rebuke you.
[02:48:54.777 --> 02:48:55.837]  That's on the news now.
[02:48:56.837 --> 02:48:58.358]  We told you about it before it was on the news.
[02:48:59.278 --> 02:49:01.999]  It's a total scientific dictatorship.
[02:49:02.179 --> 02:49:03.440]  They're manipulating the weather.
[02:49:03.660 --> 02:49:05.001]  They're manipulating our genetics.
[02:49:05.381 --> 02:49:06.721]  I haven't even gotten to this yet.
[02:49:08.242 --> 02:49:10.043]  Last night, we're up here working late on a film.
[02:49:10.823 --> 02:49:13.304]  I order for the office a couple Papa John's pizzas.
[02:49:16.086 --> 02:49:19.227]  And I don't consider it total junk food, but it certainly is fattening.
[02:49:20.808 --> 02:49:22.969]  And the pizzas come in and I'm putting pepper.
[02:49:23.309 --> 02:49:23.929]  I love pepper.
[02:49:24.229 --> 02:49:25.690]  I'm dumping a whole pack of the pepper.
[02:49:26.886 --> 02:49:27.586]  On my pizza.
[02:49:28.407 --> 02:49:30.027]  And I read the label.
[02:49:30.528 --> 02:49:33.149]  And it says, crushed red peppers treated with radiation.
[02:49:34.129 --> 02:49:35.070]  Zoom in on this for me.
[02:49:38.451 --> 02:49:40.912]  Crushed red peppers treated with radiation.
[02:49:40.932 --> 02:49:43.574]  And you're going, what does that have to do with chemtrailing?
[02:49:43.594 --> 02:49:45.274]  What does that have to do with genetic engineering?
[02:49:45.835 --> 02:49:55.399]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't describe to you the information I know that is publicly available and mainstream news.
[02:49:57.159 --> 02:50:14.224]  I can't begin to even... I mean, look, I mentioned last night how five years ago, in 2004, the EPA approved spraying live viruses on most meat.
[02:50:16.805 --> 02:50:17.845]  And people don't believe me.
[02:50:17.885 --> 02:50:20.526]  Here's New York Times.
[02:50:20.766 --> 02:50:24.067]  Agency approves first use of viruses as food additive.
[02:50:24.147 --> 02:50:24.907]  Live viruses.
[02:50:25.834 --> 02:50:30.496]  Here is ABC News, viral meat spray, advancing food safety.
[02:50:31.216 --> 02:50:37.938]  I have newscasts where they say mercury is good for your children's brains and that melamine is good for babies when it kills people.
[02:50:39.539 --> 02:50:44.040]  The government says that they want to put lithium in your water.
[02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:50.242]  The government admittedly puts over 150 chemicals in your water already that cause cancer and sterilize you.
[02:50:50.603 --> 02:50:54.384]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, do you understand what's going on?
[02:50:57.691 --> 02:50:59.071]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[02:50:59.431 --> 02:51:02.692]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[02:51:03.232 --> 02:51:07.453]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[02:51:08.073 --> 02:51:13.114]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[02:51:13.774 --> 02:51:16.215]  Patriotfood.com.
[02:51:16.235 --> 02:51:20.656]  135 pounds of long-lasting, dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[02:51:21.336 --> 02:51:26.057]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[02:51:27.083 --> 02:51:33.446]  And SurvivalistSeeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[02:51:33.466 --> 02:51:37.068]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[02:51:37.488 --> 02:51:43.331]  That's over 4 pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[02:51:43.871 --> 02:51:47.693]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[02:51:48.193 --> 02:51:51.975]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[02:51:52.515 --> 02:51:55.056]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[02:51:57.626 --> 02:52:01.254]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:01.674 --> 02:52:04.660]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:04.901 --> 02:52:06.324]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:07.020 --> 02:52:09.701]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:09.721 --> 02:52:15.904]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:16.084 --> 02:52:21.126]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:21.627 --> 02:52:31.251]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:31.371 --> 02:52:33.493]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:33.733 --> 02:52:35.074]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:35.314 --> 02:52:37.596]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:37.776 --> 02:52:39.617]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:39.898 --> 02:52:44.681]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:45.062 --> 02:52:55.029]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:56.450 --> 02:52:58.472]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[02:52:59.099 --> 02:53:00.520]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[02:53:00.960 --> 02:53:02.361]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[02:53:02.741 --> 02:53:06.303]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[02:53:06.704 --> 02:53:10.906]  Beta Prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.
[02:53:11.246 --> 02:53:15.849]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and intimacy.
[02:53:16.249 --> 02:53:21.331]  Beta Prostate has plant sterols shown to support healthy urine flow and healthy sleeping habits.
[02:53:21.692 --> 02:53:30.416]  And Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 sawpaw metal capsules to get the same plant sterols found in one Beta Prostate.
[02:53:30.776 --> 02:53:33.537]  New customers can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate.
[02:53:33.797 --> 02:53:35.218]  You only pay shipping and handling.
[02:53:35.498 --> 02:53:38.319]  To get your free bottle of Beta Prostate, call 1-800-360-8306.
[02:53:38.339 --> 02:53:38.560]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[02:53:44.062 --> 02:53:46.743]  This offer is for one free bottle per household.
[02:53:47.063 --> 02:53:49.644]  Call now and try Beta Prostate for free.
[02:53:49.924 --> 02:53:51.625]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[02:53:52.906 --> 02:53:53.466]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[02:53:53.486 --> 02:54:09.132]  Look, I covered geoengineering manipulations of the weather by a private global government in a concise fashion in the last 40 minutes or so.
[02:54:10.572 --> 02:54:11.293]  What I want to do
[02:54:12.256 --> 02:54:14.277]  Dealing with the poisoning of the food, the water.
[02:54:14.297 --> 02:54:19.039]  I want to do that in a concise ten minute fashion towards the end of the show.
[02:54:19.640 --> 02:54:27.164]  I want to go ahead and give the number out now and get into government takeover of health care that's looking more and more like a nightmare reality and take your phone calls.
[02:54:27.204 --> 02:54:29.525]  The toll free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:29.545 --> 02:54:29.605]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:38.169 --> 02:54:41.331]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[02:54:41.951 --> 02:54:49.195]  And then I'm going to get into the irradiation of your meat, your food, your vegetables, even the pepper you put on your pizza.
[02:54:50.076 --> 02:54:54.298]  I want to get on to viruses being spread on all the major meat products.
[02:54:54.798 --> 02:54:56.079]  Exactly what this means.
[02:54:56.499 --> 02:54:57.740]  What's being put in your water.
[02:54:58.060 --> 02:55:01.402]  The discussions of putting Prozac, lithium, and statins in your water.
[02:55:01.842 --> 02:55:04.744]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they're just coming out in the open with everything right now.
[02:55:05.484 --> 02:55:08.387]  This is real, and people need to be aware of this.
[02:55:09.168 --> 02:55:11.190]  So that is coming up in the next hour.
[02:55:11.210 --> 02:55:11.791]  But again, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:55:11.991 --> 02:55:16.676]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[02:55:17.016 --> 02:55:23.403]  I've done an hour and 55 minutes, 30 seconds of radio today and haven't plugged any of our sponsors.
[02:55:23.423 --> 02:55:26.827]  I want to let you know about some of the folks that made today's show possible.
[02:55:28.343 --> 02:55:31.665]  Did you know you can be drinking fresh, clean water right from the air you breathe?
[02:55:31.965 --> 02:55:33.706]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[02:55:33.746 --> 02:55:37.427]  Our sponsor, Ecolablue, with the Ecolablue 28 machine will allow you to do just that.
[02:55:37.768 --> 02:55:41.009]  It's easy to use and will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day.
[02:55:41.409 --> 02:55:42.490]  This is their base unit.
[02:55:42.550 --> 02:55:43.970]  They have other ones like the Ecolablue 30.
[02:55:44.171 --> 02:55:47.652]  It grabs water right out of the air, puts it through seven filters.
[02:55:48.032 --> 02:55:53.255]  The Ecolablue 30 puts it through a 12-stage filtering process, including reverse osmosis and carbon.
[02:55:54.380 --> 02:55:59.224]  That's acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, or give them a call, 800-691-6043.
[02:55:59.244 --> 02:56:03.248]  It is the best you can get.
[02:56:03.608 --> 02:56:06.331]  acolablue.com, or 800-691-6043.
[02:56:06.391 --> 02:56:11.376]  Also, I want to tell you about Front Sight Firearms Training.
[02:56:11.396 --> 02:56:14.038]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza?
[02:56:14.378 --> 02:56:18.082]  The founder of the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute is offering a free handgun.
[02:56:18.422 --> 02:56:19.062]  You heard me right.
[02:56:36.827 --> 02:56:40.571]  Ackfaz will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:56:40.731 --> 02:56:42.512]  No drill instructor or tough guy attitude.
[02:56:42.833 --> 02:56:43.734]  Family atmosphere.
[02:56:43.814 --> 02:56:46.656]  Premier training above law enforcement and military training.
[02:56:46.936 --> 02:56:48.938]  Frontsight.com, like the front of your rifle.
[02:56:49.279 --> 02:56:51.621]  Frontsight.com.
[02:56:52.101 --> 02:56:52.902]  Check them out today.
[02:56:52.922 --> 02:56:59.428]  And there's also banners on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for Frontsight.com.
[02:56:59.468 --> 02:57:01.049]  And one more sponsor I want to tell you about.
[02:57:02.071 --> 02:57:09.620]  eFoodsDirect.com, the non-hybrid, non-GMO leader, and the lowest prices in high-quality, storable foods, who I've bought from.
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:10.922]  I've bought from others who didn't like it.
[02:57:10.942 --> 02:57:13.465]  A lot of people sell you old, 5, 10-year-old crud.
[02:57:13.945 --> 02:57:16.729]  This is high-quality food, eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:57:17.109 --> 02:57:19.792]  Big banners up on InfoWars.com if you forgot the link.
[02:57:20.313 --> 02:57:22.195]  That's the letter E. FoodsDirect.com.
[02:57:22.215 --> 02:57:25.058]  You'll never stand on a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:57:25.398 --> 02:57:31.064]  They have three-day packs, seven-day packs for camping, month-long, three-month packs, year packs.
[02:57:31.324 --> 02:57:33.006]  Incredibly inexpensive.
[02:57:33.026 --> 02:57:36.610]  85% or more off supermarket prices because there's no middleman.
[02:57:36.630 --> 02:57:37.811]  The Factory Direct.
[02:57:38.829 --> 02:57:41.190]  The food's all from right here in America, except for the bananas.
[02:57:41.730 --> 02:57:44.111]  efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:57:44.251 --> 02:57:47.912]  A lot of free videos and info on their website.
[02:57:47.932 --> 02:57:48.592]  Go check it out.
[02:57:49.052 --> 02:57:51.353]  efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:57:51.973 --> 02:57:58.195]  Again, we're going to start the fourth and final hour.
[02:57:58.235 --> 02:57:58.915]  Man, these shows!
[02:58:00.492 --> 02:58:01.152]  Go by quick.
[02:58:01.172 --> 02:58:02.313]  We're going to start that hour.
[02:58:03.054 --> 02:58:04.315]  I'm going to take phone calls.
[02:58:04.455 --> 02:58:07.617]  I'm going to get some into the health care takeover and the latest on that front.
[02:58:08.577 --> 02:58:12.440]  And then I'm going to get into what's being done to your food and water.
[02:58:13.260 --> 02:58:16.643]  Just how far along this is and how it's being done by design.
[02:58:17.243 --> 02:58:19.725]  Now the average business or company owner, they're not part of it.
[02:58:20.045 --> 02:58:21.586]  It's all done compartmentalized.
[02:58:22.552 --> 02:58:25.115]  Okay, it's all done by a centralized system.
[02:58:25.135 --> 02:58:28.839]  So we're going to break that down coming up towards the end of the show in the last 15 minutes.
[02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:33.844]  But first, your phone calls and a news blitz straight ahead in the fourth and final hour.
[02:58:33.864 --> 02:58:34.305]  Stay with me.
[02:58:38.589 --> 02:58:40.792]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:41.192 --> 02:58:44.156]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:47.025 --> 02:58:49.646]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:50.046 --> 02:58:55.008]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:55.368 --> 02:58:57.109]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:58:57.429 --> 02:59:02.231]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:02.431 --> 02:59:03.372]  How much do you want?
[02:59:03.612 --> 02:59:04.352]  When do you want it?
[02:59:04.732 --> 02:59:06.333]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:06.613 --> 02:59:07.433]  When will you need it?
[02:59:07.693 --> 02:59:09.754]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:09.894 --> 02:59:10.995]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:11.235 --> 02:59:12.555]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:12.756 --> 02:59:13.796]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:59:13.956 --> 02:59:15.138]  And you can't feed yourself?
[02:59:15.298 --> 02:59:17.821]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:18.021 --> 02:59:21.226]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:21.606 --> 02:59:25.111]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:25.431 --> 02:59:26.413]  How much will you need?
[02:59:26.653 --> 02:59:27.274]  We don't know.
[02:59:27.554 --> 02:59:28.475]  How much do you want?
[02:59:28.656 --> 02:59:29.376]  All you can get.
[02:59:29.396 --> 02:59:30.418]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:30.678 --> 02:59:33.440]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:33.720 --> 02:59:35.922]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:35.962 --> 02:59:36.922]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:36.942 --> 02:59:38.083]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:38.103 --> 02:59:39.524]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio.
[03:00:04.884 --> 03:00:06.405]  Okay, I'm on a phone blitz!
[03:00:07.686 --> 03:00:10.748]  I always try to do this, but the calls always bring up some interesting info.
[03:00:10.768 --> 03:00:12.289]  We get stuck on one caller for 20 minutes.
[03:00:12.349 --> 03:00:14.150]  Each caller, you got one minute.
[03:00:14.810 --> 03:00:16.391]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air.
[03:00:16.431 --> 03:00:16.871]  Go ahead.
[03:00:18.012 --> 03:00:19.093]  Season's greetings, Alex.
[03:00:19.653 --> 03:00:19.993]  Hey, buddy.
[03:00:21.114 --> 03:00:27.258]  Alex, I'd like to truly wish you and yours and all of us the very best New Year for our families and for our fight against this evil.
[03:00:28.238 --> 03:00:33.862]  Alex, I'd like to hearken back, uh, just with two quick comments here, uh, that you could comment on for me, please.
[03:00:35.671 --> 03:00:45.313]  To your conversation with Mr. Braverman in the beginning of the program, Alex, when I think of Hollywood, I think of tremendous publicity value on a great scale of magnitude.
[03:00:46.073 --> 03:01:01.336]  If the numerous world-famous Hollywood stars who are opposed to the New World Order agenda will come out publicly, not counting your worthy self, it would be the most devastating blow to New World Order implementation that has yet occurred.
[03:01:02.122 --> 03:01:10.806]  I'd like to ask all of you good people in Hollywood to please come forward and assist the cause of truth in all of humanity's very survival.
[03:01:11.406 --> 03:01:12.986]  Mark, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[03:01:13.026 --> 03:01:20.629]  For those that don't know, Michael Braverman, one of the executive producers on Conspiracy Theory, was on with us today.
[03:01:20.750 --> 03:01:21.910]  I'm a consultant on the show.
[03:01:22.230 --> 03:01:23.991]  It's groundbreaking this got on the air.
[03:01:24.791 --> 03:01:31.374]  And he talked about the old fake left establishment doesn't want any New World Order info on TV
[03:01:33.143 --> 03:01:34.044]  Or on television.
[03:01:34.984 --> 03:01:35.605]  Or on movies.
[03:01:37.146 --> 03:01:39.067]  Cable, broadcast TV, whatever the case is.
[03:01:39.707 --> 03:01:44.611]  And how this show, from our perspective, the true perspective, is groundbreaking.
[03:01:46.052 --> 03:01:55.938]  And I've talked about him a lot, but he never brought up the fact that Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, Woody Harrelson, and I threw those names out and he went, yeah, that's the names.
[03:01:56.118 --> 03:01:56.739]  How did you know that?
[03:01:58.926 --> 03:02:00.867]  I told you folks, you can't believe.
[03:02:03.268 --> 03:02:03.948]  Bruce Willis?
[03:02:05.549 --> 03:02:10.030]  I mean you heard, because I was never going to bring it up on air.
[03:02:11.411 --> 03:02:18.894]  Because it was private info, but Rick Linklater felt like doing it so he did because nobody told him to keep it on the lowdown.
[03:02:19.694 --> 03:02:27.857]  That Bruce Willis has been in Austin making a movie with, that was three years ago, with my good friend Rick Linklater.
[03:02:29.666 --> 03:02:33.509]  And this is like Hollywood, Texas, next to Canada.
[03:02:33.969 --> 03:02:36.551]  This is one of the biggest areas in the world for making films.
[03:02:37.131 --> 03:02:39.072]  New Zealand's another place, Australia.
[03:02:40.513 --> 03:02:46.177]  But it's inexpensive to make films here, so a lot of Hollywood stars come through, and they hear my radio show, they see my Axis TV show years ago.
[03:02:46.777 --> 03:02:54.362]  But in this case, Rick Linklater gave a bunch of my films to Bruce Willis, and Bruce had a complete awakening to the left-right paradigm.
[03:02:56.547 --> 03:02:59.108]  There's some other behind-the-scenes stuff I'm not going to get into as it was private.
[03:02:59.709 --> 03:03:17.279]  But then, whenever, this is just one case example, then whenever Rick Linklater talked about Bruce Willis' awakening from my films, because Rick's a big fan of the show and gave him a bunch of my films, at the time Terror Storm and Martial Law,
[03:03:18.988 --> 03:03:21.509]  That Bruce said, now I understand how both parties are controlled.
[03:03:21.609 --> 03:03:22.429]  We talked about that.
[03:03:22.489 --> 03:03:24.890]  Michelle Malkin came out and said, it's impossible, it can't be true.
[03:03:24.910 --> 03:03:26.991]  But she didn't call Bruce Willis, she just said it can't be true.
[03:03:29.151 --> 03:03:34.273]  Then Bruce, a few months later, gave an interview to Vanity Fair and he said, the same people that killed Kennedy run America.
[03:03:34.573 --> 03:03:35.673]  They control both parties.
[03:03:35.813 --> 03:03:37.334]  I've had an awakening to the New World Order.
[03:03:38.394 --> 03:03:39.995]  Now, I didn't even bug Rick.
[03:03:41.175 --> 03:03:45.436]  Or Bruce to try to stay in contact with Bruce Willis and try to push it.
[03:03:45.876 --> 03:03:48.577]  If Bruce Willis wants to find out how to get a hold of me and wants to come on, he can.
[03:03:49.397 --> 03:03:51.178]  Because I'm going to wake up the general public.
[03:03:51.678 --> 03:03:53.658]  And I can't count on things that may or may not happen.
[03:03:53.918 --> 03:03:55.459]  Charlie Sheen called me up out of the blue.
[03:03:55.479 --> 03:03:56.319]  I've never talked to him.
[03:03:56.939 --> 03:03:58.019]  And said, I want to go public.
[03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:04.341]  And, you know, I sit there and talk to Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, a lot of other people over the years.
[03:04:05.241 --> 03:04:07.162]  And, you know, they're all into this info.
[03:04:07.202 --> 03:04:08.662]  They order my videos when they come out.
[03:04:09.619 --> 03:04:14.922]  You know, I talk to them every once in a while, and they go, yeah, I'll come on sometime, but uh, I'm not sure.
[03:04:15.462 --> 03:04:20.425]  Because they know that the establishment will try to hurt their careers.
[03:04:21.705 --> 03:04:26.468]  As long as you want to be a fake leftist, it's fine, or be a right-winger like Tom Selleck, it's fine.
[03:04:27.148 --> 03:04:36.233]  But the point is, all the old socialists are dying off in Hollywood, and I'm telling you, 80% or more of Hollywood is anti-New World Order.
[03:04:36.253 --> 03:04:38.294]  This is all they talk about, all they're into.
[03:04:39.537 --> 03:04:42.881]  The awakening's accelerating, and the globalists are in trouble there!
[03:04:45.623 --> 03:04:48.967]  Because the big studios are losing control of their people.
[03:04:50.248 --> 03:04:51.129]  And that's what's happening.
[03:04:51.169 --> 03:04:53.191]  And it's very exciting.
[03:04:54.363 --> 03:05:01.208]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:05:01.348 --> 03:05:03.290]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[03:05:54.133 --> 03:05:59.301]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:05:59.441 --> 03:06:03.848]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:03.968 --> 03:06:05.811]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:06.252 --> 03:06:07.594]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:07.874 --> 03:06:08.896]  There is a solution.

[03:06:54.039 --> 03:06:58.281]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:06:58.581 --> 03:06:59.202]  Number one.
[03:06:59.502 --> 03:07:02.643]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:07:02.923 --> 03:07:03.504]  Number two.
[03:07:03.784 --> 03:07:08.346]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:07:08.666 --> 03:07:09.126]  It's true.
[03:07:09.427 --> 03:07:13.969]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:07:14.289 --> 03:07:14.830]  Number 3.
[03:07:15.110 --> 03:07:18.392]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:07:18.693 --> 03:07:22.436]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:07:22.616 --> 03:07:23.156]  Number 4.
[03:07:23.417 --> 03:07:25.779]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:07:26.179 --> 03:07:29.562]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:07:29.862 --> 03:07:30.062]  Number 5.
[03:07:30.643 --> 03:07:34.566]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:07:34.786 --> 03:07:39.550]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:07:39.830 --> 03:07:43.851]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:43.991 --> 03:07:45.552]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:45.792 --> 03:07:47.873]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:07:48.033 --> 03:07:50.634]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:07:50.654 --> 03:08:00.617]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:03.958 --> 03:08:06.459]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[03:08:06.519 --> 03:08:08.900]  Julio in Illinois, you're on the air.
[03:08:10.074 --> 03:08:12.155]  Alex Jones, good afternoon, Freedom Fighter.
[03:08:12.175 --> 03:08:14.956]  I was watching Bloomberg News about 20 minutes ago.
[03:08:14.996 --> 03:08:20.297]  They said the Copenhagen deal kind of fell short, which is great news.
[03:08:20.337 --> 03:08:32.721]  And then last night at 12.17 Central Time, I saw the scum known as the United States Senators, over 60 of them on the Democratic side, with the audacity to pass this bill at midnight.
[03:08:32.761 --> 03:08:33.381]  That's my comment.
[03:08:33.401 --> 03:08:34.802]  My question to you, sir, is
[03:08:36.610 --> 03:08:51.301]  I mentioned this on Jason Berman's show last night, but I think for you, I think you guys need to bring on the air constitutional lawyers to see if we can, as freedom fighters, get set to press charges on the puppet master known as Barack Hussein Obama.
[03:08:51.541 --> 03:09:05.832]  We clearly know that he violated the Logan Act by bringing President of the World at the UN, and every bill he signs from then on, including receiving the Nobel Peace Prize without the consent of Congress, everything he's done after... Yeah, that's a cash payment by a foreign group!
[03:09:06.630 --> 03:09:09.992]  So after he's done all that, everything he's done after the U.N.
[03:09:10.192 --> 03:09:14.554]  meeting in New York City has been impeachable offenses against the Constitution, against the law.
[03:09:14.574 --> 03:09:22.718]  And what they're doing is, what Nixon did right on up to Obama now, is they set the precedent to violate the Constitution and get away with it.
[03:09:23.476 --> 03:09:25.478]  There's a guy, Mark Levin.
[03:09:25.518 --> 03:09:26.178]  He's from New York.
[03:09:26.399 --> 03:09:27.640]  He's a great constitutional lawyer.
[03:09:27.660 --> 03:09:28.560]  He's a freedom fighter.
[03:09:28.821 --> 03:09:29.801]  He goes after his people.
[03:09:30.042 --> 03:09:33.585]  You need to get on some constitutional lawyers so we can get rid of these puppet masters.
[03:09:33.765 --> 03:09:36.667]  Yeah, but Mark Levin is also a neocon.
[03:09:36.687 --> 03:09:37.288]  He's pro-war.
[03:09:38.109 --> 03:09:39.330]  Oh, that's not good then.
[03:09:39.370 --> 03:09:40.291]  Never mind about him.
[03:09:40.331 --> 03:09:41.973]  No, I mean, that's okay.
[03:09:42.033 --> 03:09:48.659]  I'm just saying, you know, you've got the right wing all right now, kind of as the patriots, but remember what happens once they get in power.
[03:09:48.979 --> 03:09:52.802]  We need to remove both leaderships, because they're all rotten to the core.
[03:09:52.842 --> 03:09:55.304]  But I tell you, this Obama has taken it to new levels.
[03:09:55.345 --> 03:09:57.547]  I appreciate your points, Julio, though.
[03:09:57.607 --> 03:09:58.047]  Well said.
[03:09:59.188 --> 03:10:00.910]  Let's talk to Randy in Florida.
[03:10:01.430 --> 03:10:02.291]  Randy, you're on the air.
[03:10:03.243 --> 03:10:04.403]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:10:04.423 --> 03:10:06.564]  First time caller, long time listener.
[03:10:06.624 --> 03:10:06.844]  Thanks.
[03:10:06.904 --> 03:10:10.785]  You guys are the president of the planet and for everything you guys are doing.
[03:10:15.146 --> 03:10:15.466]  You there?
[03:10:16.006 --> 03:10:16.406]  Yes, sir.
[03:10:17.567 --> 03:10:30.330]  I haven't heard anything about it, but over here in Central Florida, I'm in Poinciana, and man, I'll tell you what, it's less than every ten minutes you've seen a plane flying over, and they're laying out vast amounts of chemtrails here.
[03:10:31.365 --> 03:10:34.411]  It's easy to fit it out to the, you know, the storms that are heading up north.
[03:10:36.054 --> 03:10:39.722]  We're getting in the skies after several hours.
[03:10:39.922 --> 03:10:40.824]  You start seeing a little...
[03:10:42.082 --> 03:10:44.964]  It kind of looks like a rainbow in the sky, but they're laying flat.
[03:10:45.204 --> 03:10:46.424]  Yeah, it's chemicals.
[03:10:46.484 --> 03:10:50.227]  You have planes at 3, 4, 5,000 feet in hot weather.
[03:10:50.567 --> 03:10:51.727]  It's not ice crystals.
[03:10:52.328 --> 03:10:53.829]  And they're spraying chemicals.
[03:10:53.869 --> 03:10:57.330]  And now the White House admits it's been a long-term secret program.
[03:10:57.731 --> 03:10:59.151]  They mixed it in with the jet fuel.
[03:10:59.191 --> 03:11:00.412]  The pilots don't even know.
[03:11:00.792 --> 03:11:04.214]  They're coming in on their regular runs, and it's darkening the atmosphere.
[03:11:04.534 --> 03:11:09.677]  And I just played CNN last hour with the former head of Microsoft admitting that they own the patents.
[03:11:09.697 --> 03:11:10.698]  They're going to do it globally.
[03:11:12.635 --> 03:11:15.256]  Well, I've been taking patience over the last several days.
[03:11:15.336 --> 03:11:16.077]  I'm going to send them in.
[03:11:16.097 --> 03:11:17.637]  I'm also going to put them up on a website.
[03:11:17.737 --> 03:11:20.559]  I'd also like to, you know, say something to the people.
[03:11:20.579 --> 03:11:35.366]  You know, this morning I'm watching Senator Barrasso and I was speaking on, you know, the issues, how they're so unbalanced, and the differences between the right and the left, and billions of new, you know, new taxations, and the government openly admitting it's got no control.
[03:11:35.506 --> 03:11:40.688]  You know, the President's basically willing to sign any bill into order, you know, to play.
[03:11:41.522 --> 03:11:46.185]  And that, you know, we've completely lost any sign of control or any reasoning.
[03:11:46.225 --> 03:11:46.885]  No, I hear you.
[03:11:47.045 --> 03:11:47.806]  I hear you, Randy.
[03:11:48.326 --> 03:11:49.527]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[03:11:49.547 --> 03:11:52.568]  Look, Bush tripled the size of government.
[03:11:52.828 --> 03:12:07.637]  Obama promised to cut government and spent more than Bush, Clinton, Bush's daddy, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Nixon,
[03:12:09.136 --> 03:12:10.679]  All the way back to George Washington.
[03:12:10.739 --> 03:12:11.480]  That's a fact.
[03:12:11.560 --> 03:12:14.665]  A $4 trillion deficit and counting in 2009.
[03:12:18.015 --> 03:12:20.677]  That's just the deficit now, not all the obligations.
[03:12:21.398 --> 03:12:26.582]  And government health care, and more wars, and more taxes, and carbon taxes.
[03:12:26.682 --> 03:12:29.204]  It is a mass looting, Randy.
[03:12:29.885 --> 03:12:34.788]  It is criminal government snatching and stealing everything that's even nailed down.
[03:12:35.069 --> 03:12:36.470]  They're taking the kitchen sink.
[03:12:36.730 --> 03:12:37.771]  They're pulling up the tile.
[03:12:37.991 --> 03:12:39.392]  They're ripping out the wood paneling.
[03:12:39.592 --> 03:12:41.114]  They are robbing us blind.
[03:12:41.354 --> 03:12:42.435]  They are taking everything.
[03:12:43.382 --> 03:12:46.685]  And leaving a police state behind as a rearguard action to protect themselves.
[03:12:47.425 --> 03:12:50.168]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Illinois.
[03:12:50.188 --> 03:12:50.868]  Tony, go ahead.
[03:12:50.888 --> 03:12:52.850]  Alex, it's great to talk to you.
[03:12:53.530 --> 03:12:56.353]  You know, it's funny you were mentioning about you're on ManCow.
[03:12:56.373 --> 03:12:59.375]  You know, I'm from the Chicagoland area, so I have a list of them.
[03:12:59.395 --> 03:13:00.376]  We obviously know who he is.
[03:13:01.197 --> 03:13:04.720]  And when I heard you on there, I knew right away you were, you know, a fair shot in there.
[03:13:04.760 --> 03:13:06.161]  But I thought, you know, you held your own.
[03:13:06.201 --> 03:13:06.721]  You did great.
[03:13:06.861 --> 03:13:09.583]  Well, no, I mean, I've been on... Let me just make this point before you go on.
[03:13:09.844 --> 03:13:11.005]  I've been on ManCow's show.
[03:13:12.421 --> 03:13:14.983]  Probably 50, 60, 70, maybe 100 times.
[03:13:15.003 --> 03:13:17.065]  I mean, I'm on there almost every week.
[03:13:17.245 --> 03:13:19.147]  They ask me to come on for 10, 15 minutes, I do it.
[03:13:19.707 --> 03:13:22.670]  And he's invited me up there, and he's invited me to events, and he's nice.
[03:13:23.170 --> 03:13:30.756]  It's just that he still, when I talk about the White House science czar, he gives a press conference and says, we're terraforming the planet, we're manipulating the weather.
[03:13:31.537 --> 03:13:49.582]  And they have their guys on CNN, he still laughs at me, because, I mean, it's like mainstream media tells me there's no new world order being set up, when I have a giant stack of mainstream news articles here in front of me today, where they're calling for global government!
[03:13:49.702 --> 03:13:51.123]  I mean, that was the point I was making.
[03:13:51.963 --> 03:13:53.363]  Yeah, and you know what, Stuart?
[03:13:53.984 --> 03:13:58.545]  If you look at it, you know, you listen to the radio, and even, you know, talk shows, there's a left and a right,
[03:13:59.443 --> 03:14:07.666]  And they both argue against each other, and they've gotten the American people so against each other, because they argue the left or the right side, that they're not seeing what's in the middle.
[03:14:07.686 --> 03:14:11.448]  Like, you know, you're in the middle, I'm in the middle, and we're seeing what's going on here.
[03:14:11.848 --> 03:14:13.208]  And they even give you a fake middle.
[03:14:13.308 --> 03:14:15.669]  Fake middle means you're a socialist instead of a communist.
[03:14:16.229 --> 03:14:18.970]  You know, the Republicans are the socialists, the Democrats are the communists.
[03:14:19.731 --> 03:14:20.891]  It's all command and control.
[03:14:21.391 --> 03:14:22.692]  I'm not in the left, right, or middle.
[03:14:22.792 --> 03:14:24.412]  I'm outside their fake paradigm.
[03:14:24.673 --> 03:14:25.693]  I'm anti-corruption.
[03:14:26.755 --> 03:14:27.375]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:14:27.455 --> 03:14:39.801]  Anti-corruption, pro-constitution, let's get this country back on track, which sometimes seems like it's an impossible feat, but if we keep up the good fight, I believe we should overcome this and hopefully, you know, we keep spreading the word.
[03:14:39.841 --> 03:14:40.701]  Your word, my word.
[03:14:41.402 --> 03:14:43.643]  And try to keep everyone in this forum as possible.
[03:14:43.663 --> 03:14:49.265]  When you come on and you give all your data and you say, here's the data right here, right in front of me, you can look it up yourself.
[03:14:49.706 --> 03:14:52.487]  Sometimes people are too lazy to do that, but that's what you want people to do.
[03:14:52.987 --> 03:14:54.349]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[03:14:54.369 --> 03:14:55.430]  Let's go ahead and talk to Trent in Canada.
[03:14:55.450 --> 03:14:56.271]  Trent, you're on the air.
[03:15:09.718 --> 03:15:23.349]  Alright, you know, with the establishment coming forward and stating that they're doing the spraying, how is it that we don't know for sure that they're the ones that are responsible for this alleged climate change or whatever is happening that they figure is wrong?
[03:15:23.369 --> 03:15:27.593]  And I just want to point out, a lot of the stuff that's happening in the States right now,
[03:15:28.206 --> 03:15:35.112]  There's a lot of stuff that happened in Canada back in the 80s, you know, with the GST being put in and gun registration happening.
[03:15:35.152 --> 03:15:38.315]  You know, I think it's a matter of having the U.S.
[03:15:38.415 --> 03:15:41.737]  equalize with Canada for this North American Union, I think.
[03:15:41.798 --> 03:15:43.379]  Yeah, that's what globalization is.
[03:15:43.399 --> 03:15:50.505]  That's what they say, is taking Americans and Canadians and British rights so we can be like all the other countries that live under tyranny.
[03:15:51.499 --> 03:15:58.262]  Yeah, are they planning to have this also be equalized, like with the European Union?
[03:15:59.522 --> 03:16:04.744]  Yes, in fact, it's in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, now out for three years.
[03:16:05.344 --> 03:16:09.166]  We show a press conference with Merkel and Barroso of the EU.
[03:16:09.886 --> 03:16:15.128]  Angela Merkel, the head of Germany and the head of the EU at the time, Barroso,
[03:16:16.363 --> 03:16:20.186]  Well, that's all I wanted to point out, so thanks a lot, and the best to you.
[03:16:42.847 --> 03:16:44.067]  Trent, thank you so much.
[03:16:44.127 --> 03:16:44.748]  Great points.
[03:16:45.148 --> 03:16:46.668]  Mike in Vermont disagrees.
[03:16:46.868 --> 03:16:47.569]  Mike, go ahead.
[03:16:47.589 --> 03:16:49.069]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[03:16:49.989 --> 03:16:53.250]  This is Mike from Vermont.
[03:16:53.490 --> 03:17:05.834]  I disagree with you on the chemtrail comment you made regarding the being the fuel being contaminated with whatever and that the pilots don't know what they're doing, you know, don't realize it.
[03:17:06.074 --> 03:17:10.516]  I disagree with that because up here, I mean, I watch him turn it on and off at will.
[03:17:11.651 --> 03:17:11.912]  Are you
[03:17:31.513 --> 03:17:33.814]  Okay, uh, yeah, in that case, yeah, I agree.
[03:17:33.834 --> 03:17:37.016]  But, uh, yeah, but these guys, you know, I say they know exactly what they're doing.
[03:17:50.768 --> 03:17:52.189]  They mess the sky up every day.
[03:17:52.209 --> 03:17:53.489]  I mean, it's a daily thing.
[03:17:53.509 --> 03:17:59.952]  Folks, think back pre-1995 to those big blue skies that you had almost all the time when there weren't clouds.
[03:18:00.232 --> 03:18:02.073]  Now it's always a ratty haze.
[03:18:02.593 --> 03:18:09.257]  Every day I walk out in Austin at like 4,000 feet, it's a haze drifting down made up of the chemtrails.
[03:18:09.937 --> 03:18:10.997]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:18:11.057 --> 03:18:13.939]  Well, that's about it, Alex.
[03:18:13.979 --> 03:18:14.999]  That's the only thing I thought.
[03:18:15.019 --> 03:18:16.560]  I didn't realize what you were.
[03:18:17.344 --> 03:18:19.405]  Yeah, I might have misunderstood it.
[03:18:20.106 --> 03:18:22.488]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[03:18:22.688 --> 03:18:29.853]  That's my problem, is that if I'm going to take calls and go over subjects, I've always got 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 times the evidence and facets and info.
[03:18:29.873 --> 03:18:31.574]  It's like when you hear the term fluoride,
[03:18:40.663 --> 03:18:46.724]  That is a catch-all term under federal law for over a hundred and fifty chemicals put in water on average.
[03:18:47.005 --> 03:18:49.005]  They have authorization to put over three hundred in.
[03:18:49.685 --> 03:18:56.947]  And all of them are associated with infertility in men and women, with cancer, with bone fractures, with bone cancer.
[03:18:58.187 --> 03:19:04.889]  There are thousands of government studies admitting that just sodium fluoride in water doubles
[03:19:05.934 --> 03:19:07.436]  Men's chances of bone cancer.
[03:19:07.456 --> 03:19:08.137]  People don't believe me.
[03:19:08.157 --> 03:19:10.719]  I'll do it live on TV right now, simulcasting on radio.
[03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:13.282]  Google, fluoride bone cancer.
[03:19:13.823 --> 03:19:16.425]  When we come back from break, I'll show you mainstream studies.
[03:19:16.946 --> 03:19:18.067]  That's just one thing.
[03:19:18.508 --> 03:19:20.570]  They know it's sterilizing you.
[03:19:20.970 --> 03:19:22.492]  They know it makes you passive.
[03:19:23.293 --> 03:19:24.714]  That's why your sperm counts down.
[03:19:25.666 --> 03:19:28.248]  They know irradiating food destroys its food value.
[03:19:28.508 --> 03:19:31.510]  They know spraying live viruses on most of the meat you eat is deadly.
[03:19:31.911 --> 03:19:32.811]  That's all coming up.
[03:19:32.871 --> 03:19:34.673]  I'm going to cover it from Mainstream News.
[03:19:35.313 --> 03:19:37.334]  Folks, we're so far gone.
[03:19:37.375 --> 03:19:38.675]  We're so deep into it.
[03:19:38.936 --> 03:19:43.719]  We've been incrementally taught to accept this, and now they've been covertly doing it for decades.
[03:19:43.739 --> 03:19:47.842]  Now they're saying, oh, we're going to put lithium and Prozac in your water to make you happy.
[03:19:48.382 --> 03:19:50.504]  Oh, we are sterilizing you in the water.
[03:19:50.904 --> 03:19:52.585]  Oh, we are irradiating your food.
[03:19:52.766 --> 03:19:54.367]  Oh, we are spraying viruses on your beef.
[03:19:55.799 --> 03:19:57.081]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:19:57.421 --> 03:20:00.945]  Alex and I have talked about food security for your family for years.
[03:20:01.426 --> 03:20:09.195]  Now we're into the holiday season, the happy time of year when friends and family come together, and food is always the expression of our shared love and caring.
[03:20:13.831 --> 03:20:14.972]  But you've asked for most.
[03:20:15.593 --> 03:20:21.039]  Easy to make prepared meals that taste great, and a smaller than one year supply for greater affordability.
[03:20:21.239 --> 03:20:30.129]  I don't have to tell you, that the troubled times and loss of freedoms that we only anticipated in 2008, have arrived in our lives with a vengeance.
[03:20:30.609 --> 03:20:39.552]  This holiday special is designed to bring peace and security to you and yours and comes with a free 7-day responder for you to give to someone less fortunate.
[03:20:39.772 --> 03:20:41.473]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[03:20:41.493 --> 03:20:41.913]  That's 800-409-5633.
[03:20:41.973 --> 03:20:45.934]  We here at efoodsdirect wish you peace, security, and plenty this holiday season.
[03:20:56.042 --> 03:20:59.685]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:00.065 --> 03:21:03.088]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:03.308 --> 03:21:04.729]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:21:05.436 --> 03:21:08.117]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:08.517 --> 03:21:14.338]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:14.498 --> 03:21:19.539]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:19.859 --> 03:21:22.840]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:21:22.960 --> 03:21:29.661]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:29.781 --> 03:21:31.902]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:32.142 --> 03:21:33.462]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:33.722 --> 03:21:36.003]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:36.183 --> 03:21:38.023]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:38.303 --> 03:21:43.125]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:43.445 --> 03:21:52.568]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:54.702 --> 03:22:00.905]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:01.366 --> 03:22:09.150]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:09.490 --> 03:22:15.053]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[03:22:15.393 --> 03:22:17.354]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[03:22:17.635 --> 03:22:22.398]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:22.738 --> 03:22:27.481]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:27.961 --> 03:22:31.824]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:22:32.304 --> 03:22:33.325]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[03:23:04.484 --> 03:23:06.825]  Okay, actually, we're more than just one guy.
[03:23:06.925 --> 03:23:09.747]  We're a California-based company that's been serving our U.S.
[03:23:09.787 --> 03:23:15.510]  military and other government agencies with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[03:23:16.130 --> 03:23:18.712]  See all about us at freeze-dryguy.com.

[03:23:45.524 --> 03:23:46.484]  That's 866-404-3663.
[03:23:46.644 --> 03:23:50.685]  Or go to freezedryguy.com.
[03:23:50.825 --> 03:23:51.906]  Freeze Dry Guy.
[03:23:52.006 --> 03:23:53.346]  The best you can buy.
[03:23:53.366 --> 03:24:00.168]  The butcher man says it's the end of time.
[03:24:00.268 --> 03:24:03.549]  In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[03:24:08.479 --> 03:24:19.652]  The interest is up and the stock market's down, and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[03:24:20.133 --> 03:24:25.459]  I live back in the woods, you see, my woman and the kids and the dogs and me.
[03:24:30.595 --> 03:24:33.142]  I wish everybody a great Christmas Eve and Christmas coming up!
[03:24:40.674 --> 03:24:42.455]  I want to thank you for joining us today.
[03:24:42.475 --> 03:24:46.677]  I'm going to go to more of your phone calls and I'm going to get into the latest on health care.
[03:24:47.478 --> 03:24:53.901]  The White House is saying you're a Nazi, that's the Washington Times, that you're really a racist against health care.
[03:24:54.242 --> 03:24:56.283]  If you call Obama a socialist, you're a racist.
[03:24:56.603 --> 03:24:58.964]  They're invoking race to divide people.
[03:24:59.665 --> 03:25:01.886]  But right now, let's go to Randall in Mississippi.
[03:25:02.326 --> 03:25:03.547]  Randall, thanks for holding.
[03:25:04.367 --> 03:25:08.870]  Hello Alex, this is my first time calling and I want to say I appreciate your work and your passion.
[03:25:10.323 --> 03:25:20.600]  I'm going to let the New World Order know that I hate their guts and I haven't been drinking their fluoridated water for the last two decades I've been living in the country.
[03:25:21.141 --> 03:25:22.163]  So I'm not passive.
[03:25:22.955 --> 03:25:24.456]  And I'm not dumbed down.
[03:25:25.277 --> 03:25:27.238]  I'm spreading the word, man.
[03:25:52.955 --> 03:25:53.655]  No.
[03:25:55.236 --> 03:26:01.939]  And I'm going to let you know, it comes at a price to spread the word because there's this thing called gang stalking.
[03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:06.342]  If your listeners don't know what it is, Google it.
[03:26:06.862 --> 03:26:09.503]  And that's what's been happening to me for the last two and a half years.
[03:26:09.563 --> 03:26:11.364]  I've been harassed 24-7.
[03:26:12.265 --> 03:26:12.985]  And I don't care.
[03:26:13.965 --> 03:26:15.166]  That's the price you've got to pay.
[03:26:15.946 --> 03:26:17.247]  Well, Randall, good to hear from you.
[03:26:17.267 --> 03:26:18.348]  I appreciate your call.
[03:26:18.388 --> 03:26:19.588]  Joe in Pennsylvania.
[03:26:19.948 --> 03:26:20.849]  Joe, you're on the air.
[03:26:23.955 --> 03:26:25.015]  Turn the radio off, buddy.
[03:26:25.035 --> 03:26:28.477]  Okay, we'll come back to Joe in a minute.
[03:26:28.637 --> 03:26:30.438]  Eric in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[03:26:30.458 --> 03:26:33.380]  Hey Alex, nice to talk to you.
[03:26:35.941 --> 03:26:42.545]  I think that with all the chemtrails and everything, I think they're trying to like accelerate an ice age.
[03:26:42.605 --> 03:26:43.426]  What do you think of that?
[03:26:45.707 --> 03:26:50.409]  John P. Holdren, the White House science czar, believed we were going to have an ice age in the 70s.
[03:26:51.847 --> 03:26:58.513]  And we are, the evidence shows, tipping towards, we're at the end of a 12,000 year warming cycle.
[03:26:58.533 --> 03:27:05.199]  And they know the main ice age, the glacial periods, come every 12,000 years, we've been in an interglacial period.
[03:27:05.940 --> 03:27:09.523]  And all of the chemtrail spraying does cool the earth.
[03:27:09.684 --> 03:27:11.585]  And the earth has been cooling for nine years.
[03:27:12.766 --> 03:27:13.547]  And they know that.
[03:27:13.687 --> 03:27:14.168]  So yes.
[03:27:15.512 --> 03:27:17.152]  I mean, there's no telling what they're doing.
[03:27:17.192 --> 03:27:22.894]  They just admit they've had a long-term, global, secret weather modification program going on.
[03:27:23.314 --> 03:27:26.735]  That's what's wrong with shadow national security government.
[03:27:27.055 --> 03:27:28.535]  We don't know what the truth is.
[03:27:28.995 --> 03:27:30.736]  These people have unlimited funding.
[03:27:31.016 --> 03:27:32.096]  They do whatever they want.
[03:27:32.276 --> 03:27:33.417]  They're playing God.
[03:27:34.637 --> 03:27:35.237]  Absolutely.
[03:27:35.637 --> 03:27:39.138]  Another thing, you talked about what they do with the food.
[03:27:40.016 --> 03:27:41.537]  I work in the restaurant industry.
[03:27:41.997 --> 03:27:44.678]  In the fryer oil, they put silicone in it.
[03:27:44.698 --> 03:27:47.139]  It's called dimethylpolysilazine.
[03:27:47.179 --> 03:27:49.460]  It's silicone, like what they use in breast implants.
[03:27:49.901 --> 03:27:55.763]  And when you heat it up to about 300 degrees, it turns into formaldehyde, which is cancer-causing.
[03:27:56.003 --> 03:27:56.984]  Let me stop you for a minute.
[03:27:57.004 --> 03:28:02.086]  I've read about the special ingredients in a lot of French fry oil, being carcinogens.
[03:28:02.446 --> 03:28:03.307]  You're telling me
[03:28:04.454 --> 03:28:06.895]  Because the stuff they put in breast implants is poisonous.
[03:28:06.915 --> 03:28:09.376]  You're telling me that's in the fryer grease?
[03:28:09.796 --> 03:28:14.377]  Absolutely, and they actually put it in the cheese.
[03:28:14.658 --> 03:28:21.760]  If you just type in pizza hut and silicone, there's an article on wrench.com about how pizza hut puts it in their cheese.
[03:28:22.200 --> 03:28:29.865]  Well, I've got to read that, because that's a questionable source, but I will check into that for myself.
[03:28:29.945 --> 03:28:30.946]  I appreciate it.
[03:28:31.746 --> 03:28:35.048]  That is just amazing, amazing information.
[03:28:35.068 --> 03:28:41.112]  I mean, I don't doubt it, but I have to look at that for myself.
[03:28:43.434 --> 03:28:44.254]  I mean, who knows?
[03:28:44.634 --> 03:28:45.515]  In fact, where did it go?
[03:28:45.615 --> 03:28:50.178]  I had my Papa John's pepper.
[03:28:51.380 --> 03:28:56.043]  I was putting on my cheese pizza and it says crushed red peppers treated with radiation.
[03:28:56.363 --> 03:29:01.686]  I'm going to cover that after I come back and talk to John in PA, John in Florida, Michael in California and a few others.
[03:29:02.126 --> 03:29:08.250]  Then I'm going to briefly get into the latest on health care and then I'm going to spend a few minutes on how they're poisoning us.
[03:29:08.910 --> 03:29:13.193]  Just hit a few of the key points on that front today.
[03:29:13.573 --> 03:29:14.713]  We're going to break right now.
[03:29:15.854 --> 03:29:18.516]  I want to remind listeners I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[03:29:18.876 --> 03:29:26.461]  You can see all my films in super high quality and watch the live TV simulcast of the radio show at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:29:26.481 --> 03:29:31.965]  And it's not too late as a Christmas gift to give friends and family PrisonPlanet.TV memberships.
[03:29:31.985 --> 03:29:34.607]  They're 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[03:29:34.967 --> 03:29:37.809]  Or get a year membership and get five and a half months free.
[03:29:38.269 --> 03:29:43.713]  Give yourself a gift and then give them the passcode as an e-card and give them a gift of truth.
[03:29:45.049 --> 03:29:48.039]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:49.003 --> 03:29:51.672]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:55.049 --> 03:29:57.650]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:29:58.051 --> 03:30:03.013]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:30:03.373 --> 03:30:05.114]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:30:05.435 --> 03:30:10.237]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:10.437 --> 03:30:11.398]  How much do you want?
[03:30:11.618 --> 03:30:12.358]  When do you want it?
[03:30:12.738 --> 03:30:14.339]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:14.619 --> 03:30:15.440]  When will you need it?
[03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:17.761]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:17.901 --> 03:30:19.002]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:19.242 --> 03:30:20.543]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:21.223 --> 03:30:23.125]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[03:30:23.305 --> 03:30:25.827]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:30:26.007 --> 03:30:29.230]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:29.610 --> 03:30:33.113]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:33.434 --> 03:30:34.414]  How much will you need?
[03:30:34.655 --> 03:30:35.275]  We don't know.
[03:30:35.555 --> 03:30:36.476]  How much do you want?
[03:30:36.676 --> 03:30:37.397]  All you can get.
[03:30:37.417 --> 03:30:38.398]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:38.678 --> 03:30:41.441]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:30:41.722 --> 03:30:43.484]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:43.504 --> 03:30:44.425]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:30:54.062 --> 03:30:59.249]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:59.369 --> 03:31:03.735]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:31:03.915 --> 03:31:05.758]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:31:06.178 --> 03:31:07.540]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:31:07.800 --> 03:31:08.842]  There is a solution.
[03:31:09.062 --> 03:31:17.085]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:31:17.485 --> 03:31:24.548]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[03:31:54.039 --> 03:32:00.883]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:32:01.003 --> 03:32:02.944]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:32:03.104 --> 03:32:05.225]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:32:05.345 --> 03:32:06.866]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:32:07.006 --> 03:32:11.328]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[03:32:41.823 --> 03:32:43.744]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[03:33:08.061 --> 03:33:10.622]  I'm here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:33:10.642 --> 03:33:11.242]  to 3 p.m.
[03:33:11.282 --> 03:33:11.602]  Central.
[03:33:11.622 --> 03:33:13.223]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[03:33:13.283 --> 03:33:13.583]  Eastern.
[03:33:14.003 --> 03:33:17.545]  I return with an abbreviated transmission every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:33:18.005 --> 03:33:19.485]  Central Standard Time.
[03:33:19.946 --> 03:33:21.166]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:33:21.706 --> 03:33:25.748]  What I'm going to do first is go ahead and just get into a small snapshot.
[03:33:26.548 --> 03:33:31.311]  It's many times worse than I can even describe of what's in your water, what's in your food, what's happening.
[03:33:31.771 --> 03:33:38.354]  Then I'm going to briefly hit the latest on health care and then talk to John, Michael, Dan, Michael, George, and others that are patiently holding.
[03:33:40.356 --> 03:33:53.383]  For over a hundred years, the eugenicists out of England, the U.S., and Germany, Hitler was only one brand of it, have been setting up health departments, secretly taking DNA samples from babies for the last 37 years.
[03:33:53.723 --> 03:33:55.584]  That's now been declassified and been in the news.
[03:33:56.980 --> 03:34:10.845]  They wrote literally hundreds of government white papers we've covered here in the 50s where they said we want to put chemicals in the water to reduce fertility, to sterilize people, and to dumb people down, and to reduce their life expectancy.
[03:34:12.646 --> 03:34:15.947]  And all over the country, drugs have been found in reservoirs
[03:34:17.071 --> 03:34:22.335]  At levels, in some cases, hundreds of times what they could be from sewage runoff.
[03:34:22.875 --> 03:34:34.023]  They've been found in mountain reservoirs, this has been in the Associated Press, where it's original water, original rainwater, original glacier water, original mountain snow runoff.
[03:34:34.563 --> 03:34:41.608]  There is no sewage involved, it's original source water, and there's Prozac and birth control and other things in it.
[03:34:41.748 --> 03:34:45.131]  Now, the US government's proposed putting Prozac in the water.
[03:34:45.811 --> 03:34:47.532]  Serotonin reuptake inhibitor type drugs.
[03:34:47.792 --> 03:34:48.773]  We've played those news clips.
[03:34:49.113 --> 03:34:51.034]  The Japanese government's been considering it.
[03:34:51.314 --> 03:34:55.237]  They've now been pushing putting lithium in the water, which is an anti-psychotic.
[03:34:56.537 --> 03:35:00.620]  And talking about how natural it is and how it's no big deal and how it helps end suicide.
[03:35:00.640 --> 03:35:03.902]  They're talking about putting anti-cholesterol statins in the water.
[03:35:04.342 --> 03:35:11.226]  It's now coming out, statins don't really mess with your cholesterol too much, that most cholesterol's good, and that it's causing liver problems.
[03:35:11.306 --> 03:35:12.527]  And that's mainstream news.
[03:35:14.105 --> 03:35:32.094]  So, because myself and others have been exposing what they're putting in the water, what GMO foods doing, from the real science, because all of this has been coming out, they're going from denying they're putting things in our water, to coming out and saying, lead in toys is good.
[03:35:33.535 --> 03:35:38.738]  Melamine isn't bad for kids, even though it kills them, and causes kidney failure.
[03:35:39.925 --> 03:35:43.747]  Mercury in shots actually helps your brain, doesn't harm it.
[03:35:44.727 --> 03:35:46.768]  Yeah, we are looking at putting stuff in your water.
[03:35:48.149 --> 03:35:52.131]  And they're radiating more and more food, they're spraying live viruses on food.
[03:35:52.151 --> 03:35:56.893]  I want to go over all these mainstream media sources where they throw it in your face.
[03:35:59.454 --> 03:36:04.637]  But first off, to give you an idea about how prolific this is, last night, we're up here late,
[03:36:06.044 --> 03:36:09.927]  I order a couple of Papa John's pizzas for the office after my Sunday show.
[03:36:09.947 --> 03:36:11.108]  We're up here working on a film.
[03:36:11.469 --> 03:36:12.209]  Actually, two films.
[03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:14.471]  I'm working on my film.
[03:36:14.511 --> 03:36:15.772]  Jason Burmese is working on his.
[03:36:18.074 --> 03:36:19.355]  And I say, I'll order some pizzas.
[03:36:19.916 --> 03:36:22.618]  I'm putting red pepper on my pizza.
[03:36:24.399 --> 03:36:31.725]  And after I've already eaten a couple of pieces of cheese pizza, I look down and it says, crushed red peppers by Papa John's.
[03:36:32.910 --> 03:36:36.932]  Crushed red peppers treated with radiation.
[03:36:38.433 --> 03:36:40.014]  And then it's got a symbol of a flower.
[03:36:40.214 --> 03:36:41.534]  Oh, radiation's a flower!
[03:36:41.554 --> 03:36:52.380]  I'm gonna lay this here on the table, on the broadcast desk, so the document cam can zoom right in on that for everyone watching.
[03:36:52.920 --> 03:36:57.983]  Crushed red peppers treated with radiation.
[03:37:00.299 --> 03:37:05.504]  I wish I had an unused package so I could show it where I don't have the corner ripped off like I do there.
[03:37:06.025 --> 03:37:08.347]  But is there no way to focus a little bit better?
[03:37:08.367 --> 03:37:13.733]  I guess crushed red peppers treated with radiation.
[03:37:15.815 --> 03:37:20.720]  Now, they tried to get a radiation of food passed in the 50s.
[03:37:20.820 --> 03:37:21.381]  They had all this
[03:37:23.274 --> 03:37:26.095]  Nuclear weapons waste, high-power radioactive material.
[03:37:26.556 --> 03:37:31.278]  They don't mix actual radiation granules or radioactive substances in.
[03:37:31.618 --> 03:37:38.501]  They run food for just a few seconds through high-powered radiation beams that would kill you deader than a hammer if you were in the radiation.
[03:37:39.121 --> 03:37:41.162]  And it kills bacteria, it kills other things.
[03:37:42.063 --> 03:37:48.726]  And this is so the food companies, scientists and the government wouldn't let them do it until they approved radiation eight years ago.
[03:37:50.103 --> 03:37:55.167]  Because the studies all over the world showed it destroyed the value of the food.
[03:37:55.608 --> 03:37:59.651]  It killed the living enzymes in there, the ring structures, the cofactors.
[03:38:00.071 --> 03:38:01.392]  They did rat studies with it.
[03:38:01.753 --> 03:38:02.413]  Big problems.
[03:38:02.453 --> 03:38:04.295]  But this is crushed red pepper.
[03:38:06.637 --> 03:38:08.198]  Why irradiate it?
[03:38:08.278 --> 03:38:10.280]  And most of the meat you're eating has been irradiated.
[03:38:10.300 --> 03:38:12.622]  A lot of the vegetables you're eating have been irradiated.
[03:38:12.642 --> 03:38:14.944]  This is only the tip of the iceberg.
[03:38:15.956 --> 03:38:22.558]  The GMO tomatoes and corn that they've mixed animal and insect in with, cross-species genetic engineering.
[03:38:22.898 --> 03:38:24.759]  They've crossed pigs and humans.
[03:38:25.739 --> 03:38:29.061]  They've crossed spiders and goats to create body armor.
[03:38:29.261 --> 03:38:29.961]  They won't believe me.
[03:38:30.821 --> 03:38:32.982]  Search engine, spider goats.
[03:38:33.122 --> 03:38:34.623]  CBS News Associated Press.
[03:38:34.663 --> 03:38:38.044]  Let's show them a photo of a part spider, part goat for body armor production.
[03:38:39.246 --> 03:38:41.127]  Just anything you can imagine is going on.
[03:38:41.147 --> 03:38:44.648]  They've released fish in the open sea that are part insect, part plant.
[03:38:45.728 --> 03:38:47.329]  It gives rise to super viruses.
[03:38:47.369 --> 03:38:50.050]  It gives rise to super mutations in bacteria.
[03:38:50.430 --> 03:38:52.130]  This is the true environmental threat.
[03:38:52.791 --> 03:38:56.992]  Now, here's an article from the Associated Press.
[03:38:57.732 --> 03:38:58.012]  August 19, 2006.
[03:38:58.493 --> 03:39:00.533]  This was approved in 2005.
[03:39:01.594 --> 03:39:04.635]  Agency approves first use of viruses as food additive.
[03:39:05.035 --> 03:39:07.936]  A mix of bacteria-killing viruses may be sprayed on cold cuts.
[03:39:09.108 --> 03:39:12.753]  Now, they grow these in giant viral tanks off of meat.
[03:39:28.271 --> 03:39:35.476]  And in that, those products, is the regular viruses and bacteria that were associated with it, and the mutations occur.
[03:39:36.057 --> 03:39:37.538]  So they're not just spraying these viruses.
[03:39:37.578 --> 03:39:40.500]  Now, they said, well you naturally have these viruses in your guts.
[03:39:40.860 --> 03:39:50.127]  But this is, depending on which mixture, over a thousand, in some cases over ten thousand times, more of these viruses than naturally occur in your gut.
[03:39:51.608 --> 03:39:57.352]  It's kind of like, uh, uh, Monsanto has a form of corn.
[03:39:58.365 --> 03:40:05.116]  That bugs won't eat because it has a naturally occurring fungus that grows that will kill bugs.
[03:40:05.176 --> 03:40:12.749]  But it's over a thousand times again stronger than the regular fungus and it grows inside the corn and then you eat it.
[03:40:13.953 --> 03:40:15.774]  That's one big reason a lot of honeybees are dying.
[03:40:16.335 --> 03:40:25.981]  German universities have done the studies and found they have the genetically modified corn that has this natural pesticide in it in their tiny digestive tracts.
[03:40:26.301 --> 03:40:29.803]  Because unlike other animals, bees will still get the pollen, then they go die.
[03:40:30.784 --> 03:40:33.406]  That's why they have the growth maps of where this is being grown in the U.S.
[03:40:33.446 --> 03:40:35.167]  and Europe, where the bees are dying.
[03:40:35.207 --> 03:40:36.488]  In some cases, more than 80%.
[03:40:36.808 --> 03:40:39.630]  On average, we've lost half our bees in the U.S., half in Europe.
[03:40:40.501 --> 03:40:42.203]  So, that's going on.
[03:40:42.463 --> 03:40:46.128]  So agency approves first use of viruses as food additive.
[03:40:46.628 --> 03:40:50.032]  In case you don't believe that, because I tell people this is going on and they don't believe it.
[03:40:51.254 --> 03:40:53.556]  Viral meat spray advancing food safety.
[03:40:53.617 --> 03:40:54.438]  ABC News.
[03:40:56.394 --> 03:40:58.375]  Says the food aisles don't seem very safe these days.
[03:40:58.415 --> 03:41:02.598]  There's still no firm answers as to what caused the E. Coli breakout.
[03:41:03.058 --> 03:41:14.865]  Well, see, this allows them now, when chicken and beef and poultry and pork has feces on it from the cows and pigs they slaughter and bacteria growing, they spray it down with bleach and try to clean it.
[03:41:15.265 --> 03:41:17.967]  Instead, they just leave it dirty and spray the viruses on it.
[03:41:18.467 --> 03:41:20.408]  So it allows them to feed you dirty, contaminated meat.
[03:41:20.708 --> 03:41:27.630]  The problem is most food poisoning is caused by the excrement, the secretions of the bacteria.
[03:41:28.030 --> 03:41:31.071]  Their defecation is toxic.
[03:41:31.471 --> 03:41:33.432]  And that's the main toxin that gets you sick.
[03:41:35.168 --> 03:41:59.498]  So see they just try to clean off the feces, the bacteria feces and the animals own feces and blood from when they get hit in the head with a gas powered hammer and blood spraying out everywhere and they come in with giant razor blade cutters and slit it's throat and start hacking big old pieces off and it's rolling around in feces everywhere and they're just slobbing that through and they take it in with big basters and just spray viruses all over it, breading big old giant tanks.
[03:42:03.243 --> 03:42:07.227]  And they're feeding cows worldwide rotten, ground up, dead animals from the vet.
[03:42:07.307 --> 03:42:08.648]  That's come out in mainstream news.
[03:42:08.689 --> 03:42:15.716]  They take your dead animals, grind them up in awful with dead cows and sheep and everything else and feed rotten meat to cows when they're not even meant to eat meat.
[03:42:16.256 --> 03:42:20.580]  Pry on, crystals then grow and get into the meat.
[03:42:20.861 --> 03:42:21.501]  You then eat it.
[03:42:21.521 --> 03:42:24.705]  They go to your brain, start growing because they're meant to grow in dead flesh.
[03:42:26.277 --> 03:42:28.858]  Now they've got 25-year-olds getting Alzheimer's from it.
[03:42:29.118 --> 03:42:30.679]  That's really mad cow in America.
[03:42:31.219 --> 03:42:33.820]  This is what you're feeding your family, and this is eugenics.
[03:42:34.180 --> 03:42:47.926]  The Global has stated they were going to develop soft-kill weapons, so they can give you something that makes you sick, debilitates you, and kills you in 10, 15, 20 years, and then the doctors aren't told how to diagnose it, and they don't know what's happening.
[03:42:49.073 --> 03:42:51.515]  Folks, there's thousands of these issues I could go over.
[03:42:52.135 --> 03:42:57.599]  And I've interviewed top scientists, many of them making two, three, four million dollars a year, holding patents.
[03:42:57.939 --> 03:43:04.044]  They would feed, in one case in England, in the early 90s, GMO potatoes to rats.
[03:43:04.865 --> 03:43:06.065]  They would become sterilized.
[03:43:06.486 --> 03:43:08.747]  They would have their life expectancy cut in half.
[03:43:09.548 --> 03:43:13.371]  They would have mutations after birth, which is very rare.
[03:43:14.351 --> 03:43:16.173]  I mean, literally, like,
[03:43:17.222 --> 03:43:17.923]  A horror movie.
[03:43:18.784 --> 03:43:21.266]  And then the scientists would go and say, we can't put this on the market.
[03:43:21.286 --> 03:43:22.006]  It's sterilizing.
[03:43:22.026 --> 03:43:23.748]  And they were told, shut up.
[03:43:24.669 --> 03:43:25.089]  Shut up.
[03:43:25.129 --> 03:43:25.930]  We're putting it on the market.
[03:43:26.270 --> 03:43:28.032]  They know it's sterilizing you.
[03:43:28.312 --> 03:43:33.157]  And all these CEOs and all these bankers, most of them aren't in on the larger program.
[03:43:33.437 --> 03:43:34.558]  They're eating it too.
[03:43:35.038 --> 03:43:36.440]  This is hurting all of us.
[03:43:37.816 --> 03:43:42.958]  If you're a bureaucrat, if you're an FBI agent, if you're a cop, if you're a CPS worker, you're an enforcer for this system.
[03:43:43.498 --> 03:43:59.923]  Did you get the memo not to drink the 150 plus chemicals on average, in some cases over 300, they put from fertilizer manufacturing and aluminum manufacturing, aluminum production, purification, they take that toxic waste
[03:44:00.794 --> 03:44:11.402]  Mercury, lead, arsenic, hundreds of other chemicals, sodium fluoride, all these different acid complexes of fluoride, and they dump it in your water.
[03:44:11.783 --> 03:44:16.146]  It attacks your brain, your glands, calcifies in your bones, attacks fertility.
[03:44:16.646 --> 03:44:18.908]  Oh look, spider goats start work on Wonder Web.
[03:44:19.849 --> 03:44:20.689]  What is that out of?
[03:44:20.750 --> 03:44:21.790]  Is that out of the
[03:44:22.731 --> 03:44:23.732]  Looks like the London Telegraph.
[03:44:23.752 --> 03:44:24.132]  Yeah, it is.
[03:44:24.292 --> 03:44:24.692]  Telegraph.
[03:44:24.712 --> 03:44:25.673]  I recognize all the papers.
[03:44:26.113 --> 03:44:27.054]  That's the London Telegraph.
[03:44:27.074 --> 03:44:27.734]  See, spider goats.
[03:44:27.755 --> 03:44:30.897]  Folks, we're in Buck Rogers, but it's a nightmare system.
[03:44:31.637 --> 03:44:43.225]  We're being slowly killed, slowly exterminated, and the people in pizza chains are told by their distributor, hey, we've got some low-price irradiated stuff here for you, and they just put it on the shelves.
[03:44:43.245 --> 03:44:44.746]  They ship it to your house.
[03:44:44.766 --> 03:44:48.209]  They deliver it to you to where you can't even get a packet of pepper.
[03:44:48.894 --> 03:44:51.596]  Now that hasn't been irradiated, losing its food value.
[03:44:51.836 --> 03:44:52.696]  And that's bare minimum.
[03:44:52.996 --> 03:44:57.319]  What does irradiation do, according to Marcola.com, a very trusted medical doctor source.
[03:44:58.939 --> 03:45:04.723]  Because it increases the shelf life of the food, it is used in large, centralized facilities.
[03:45:04.763 --> 03:45:12.028]  Irradiation encourages globalization and consolidation of food production, distribution, and retailing industries, and allows you to be fed food that isn't as fresh.
[03:45:12.408 --> 03:45:22.936]  Research dating the 1950s has revealed a wide range of problems with animals that ate irradiated food, including premature death and a rare form of cancer, reproductive dysfunction, chromosomal abnormal
[03:45:23.596 --> 03:45:27.320]  Abnormalities, liver damage, low weight gain, and vitamin deficiencies.
[03:45:27.540 --> 03:45:33.485]  And then they have all this sourced, a full medical source from the government's own document.
[03:45:33.505 --> 03:45:34.646]  Show them the sourcing on that.
[03:45:36.008 --> 03:45:40.832]  Irradiation destroys vitamins, essential fatty acids, and other nutrients in foods, sometimes significantly.
[03:45:40.852 --> 03:45:41.873]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[03:45:42.754 --> 03:45:47.558]  The process destroys 80% of vitamin A in eggs, but the FDA nonetheless legalized irradiation of these products.
[03:45:47.578 --> 03:45:47.939]  It goes on.
[03:45:48.803 --> 03:45:49.763]  There's all the sources.
[03:45:50.203 --> 03:45:51.044]  Absolute fact.
[03:45:51.664 --> 03:45:55.225]  So, again, I'm only giving you a very tiny fraction of this.
[03:45:55.685 --> 03:46:07.209]  Let's now play a clip from MSNBC Hardball with their CNBC co-host coming on, the Info Girl, the Info Babe, telling you, hey, what's wrong with lead in toys?
[03:46:07.249 --> 03:46:07.629]  Here it is.
[03:46:08.544 --> 03:46:11.426]  I think people should be careful what they wish for on China.
[03:46:11.446 --> 03:46:19.532]  You know, if China were to revalue its currency, or China is to start making, say, toys that don't have lead in them, or food that isn't poisonous... Can you get a little closer to the camera?
[03:46:20.813 --> 03:46:21.373]  Mike, what is it?
[03:46:21.433 --> 03:46:22.874]  Is it doing it strangely?
[03:46:23.135 --> 03:46:28.679]  Their costs of production are going to go up, and that means prices at Walmart here in the United States are going to go up, too.
[03:46:28.699 --> 03:46:30.100]  Can you get a little closer to the camera?
[03:46:30.680 --> 03:46:33.102]  Yeah, the particular clip they found, I appreciate it.
[03:46:33.142 --> 03:46:34.123]  That's not the right clip.
[03:46:34.143 --> 03:46:35.664]  That's some joke clip.
[03:46:36.785 --> 03:46:46.952]  I know we wrote an article at PrisonPlanet.com, that is Matthews, and he did say come in closer, and then she goes on to say we've got to go ahead and have the poison toys, but then as a joke put that clip back in.
[03:46:47.233 --> 03:46:49.494]  Let's do another search on that, or ask Watson.
[03:46:49.514 --> 03:46:51.376]  I want the original unedited clip for people.
[03:46:51.756 --> 03:46:53.478]  Okay, here's another clip.
[03:46:54.318 --> 03:46:57.921]  This is CBS News in Austin, but this went out nationwide.
[03:46:57.941 --> 03:46:59.522]  It's what they call a news package.
[03:46:59.823 --> 03:47:02.685]  The news is satellited to them with a script.
[03:47:02.905 --> 03:47:04.246]  The local news readers read it.
[03:47:04.466 --> 03:47:16.556]  But this went out nationwide on all CBS TV channels, telling you that a government study tells you that mercury is good for your brain when it's the most deadly heavy metal attacking brain cells.
[03:47:16.596 --> 03:47:16.976]  Here it is.
[03:47:17.597 --> 03:47:21.100]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Seema Mathur.
[03:47:23.729 --> 03:47:29.693]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[03:47:30.173 --> 03:47:36.597]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[03:47:36.617 --> 03:47:43.962]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[03:47:44.782 --> 03:47:52.967]  Okay, now here is Fox News telling you how great it is that Japan is looking at lithium in the water.
[03:47:52.987 --> 03:47:54.869]  And again, this is already all going on.
[03:47:55.409 --> 03:47:59.432]  You're now being told how great it is because the alternative media is exposing it.
[03:47:59.712 --> 03:48:01.773]  So they're saying, yeah, we're doing weather modification.
[03:48:01.813 --> 03:48:03.054]  Yeah, we're setting up a world government.
[03:48:03.354 --> 03:48:04.715]  Yeah, we're putting stuff in your water.
[03:48:05.015 --> 03:48:11.319]  You're now being, yeah, we're listening to your cell phones, by law, with a system that can track you and listen to you even when the phone's turned off.
[03:48:11.639 --> 03:48:13.280]  Yeah, it's all happening.
[03:48:13.481 --> 03:48:13.841]  Here it is.
[03:48:15.410 --> 03:48:22.754]  With only two weeks left of 2009, we're taking a look back at some of the most interesting health care discoveries of the past year.
[03:48:22.874 --> 03:48:26.815]  Joining us is FOX 9 medical expert Dr. Arkell Giorgio to talk about it.
[03:48:26.855 --> 03:48:27.316]  Good morning.
[03:48:27.396 --> 03:48:27.916]  Good morning.
[03:48:28.476 --> 03:48:28.956]  First, the U.S.
[03:48:28.976 --> 03:48:35.239]  has been adding fluoride to its public water supply for decades, of course, to prevent tooth decay.
[03:48:35.580 --> 03:48:39.481]  Well, now researchers from Japan are suggesting that we add lithium.
[03:48:40.962 --> 03:48:41.903]  Back it up a few seconds.
[03:48:42.364 --> 03:48:47.590]  Notice that she says, eh, we put fluoride in, eh, we put stuff in table salt, eh, lithium.
[03:48:48.011 --> 03:48:49.512]  You're being sold on this.
[03:48:50.233 --> 03:48:56.100]  I mean, this is, imagine 50 years ago, a science fiction movie, where they're putting stuff in your water and food.
[03:48:56.781 --> 03:49:01.284]  Well, they did write a science fiction book in 1932, Brave New World, where they do drug you.
[03:49:01.584 --> 03:49:10.931]  And Aldous Huxley, who wrote it, his brother was a head eugenicist, he gave a 1962 speech at Berkeley saying, this is actually our plan, we are doing this, my book is non-fiction.
[03:49:11.731 --> 03:49:12.331]  Finish the clip.
[03:49:14.013 --> 03:49:19.336]  Well, now researchers from Japan are suggesting that we add lithium.
[03:49:19.416 --> 03:49:20.417]  So, why is that?
[03:49:21.092 --> 03:49:24.535]  Well, they're actually not suggesting it, but they're certainly looking into it.
[03:49:24.635 --> 03:49:31.741]  Lithium is a medication that, in prescription doses, treats mood disorders in people with bipolar disorder or manic-depressive illness.
[03:49:32.121 --> 03:49:40.628]  And what these researchers found in Japan is that lithium is present in trace amounts in the normal water supply in some communities.
[03:49:40.728 --> 03:49:43.891]  And in those communities, they have a lower suicide rate.
[03:49:44.369 --> 03:49:50.891]  And so they're really investigating whether trace amounts of lithium... And they have lower sex drive, and are obese, and have brain damage.
[03:49:50.971 --> 03:49:55.173]  ...enough to really, in a positive way, without having the bad effects... Oh, a positive way!
[03:49:55.193 --> 03:49:56.933]  ...to really affect the mood and decrease the suicide rate.
[03:49:57.033 --> 03:49:58.594]  Very interesting concept.
[03:49:58.814 --> 03:50:02.735]  You know, it's the same reason why we put iodine in salt, fluoride in water.
[03:50:03.596 --> 03:50:06.877]  There's many different examples of... Alright, so there you are.
[03:50:06.897 --> 03:50:10.678]  It goes on and on, how great it is, and how wonderful it is, and how we need it.
[03:50:11.750 --> 03:50:16.172]  And we did find the unedited clip on YouTube of the MSNBC host.
[03:50:16.532 --> 03:50:19.654]  It's a CNBC host on MSNBC with Chris Matthews.
[03:50:20.574 --> 03:50:22.935]  And he's sitting there and she's talking about how great it is to do this.
[03:50:23.876 --> 03:50:26.037]  You're being sold that poison is good.
[03:50:26.077 --> 03:50:27.757]  You're being told mercury is good for you.
[03:50:28.038 --> 03:50:30.299]  You're being told irradiation is good for you.
[03:50:30.579 --> 03:50:33.540]  You're being told GMO crops is good for you.
[03:50:34.060 --> 03:50:37.122]  As all these new diseases pop up, as all this illness takes place,
[03:50:37.662 --> 03:50:40.206]  They get to kill you off early before you get Social Security.
[03:50:40.547 --> 03:50:43.050]  Suck your savings out in medical care.
[03:50:43.591 --> 03:50:45.634]  The average doctor has no idea this is happening.
[03:50:45.875 --> 03:50:49.160]  We are all living in a nightmare science fiction control grid.
[03:50:49.480 --> 03:50:50.502]  Wake up people!
[03:50:50.562 --> 03:50:52.766]  Have the mental strength to admit what's happening.
[03:50:55.015 --> 03:50:56.677]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:50:56.777 --> 03:50:58.239]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:50:58.299 --> 03:50:59.400]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:50:59.621 --> 03:51:01.443]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:51:01.563 --> 03:51:10.293]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:51:10.353 --> 03:51:15.616]  Chemical-free Liquid Zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:51:15.776 --> 03:51:17.397]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:51:17.577 --> 03:51:24.982]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.

[03:52:00.015 --> 03:52:03.022]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:03.262 --> 03:52:04.665]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:05.367 --> 03:52:08.028]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:08.048 --> 03:52:14.270]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:14.430 --> 03:52:19.472]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:19.972 --> 03:52:29.596]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:29.716 --> 03:52:31.838]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:32.078 --> 03:52:33.420]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:33.660 --> 03:52:35.942]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:36.122 --> 03:52:37.964]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:38.245 --> 03:52:43.009]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:43.410 --> 03:52:48.175]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:52:55.154 --> 03:52:56.394]  This is an emergency alert.
[03:52:56.915 --> 03:52:58.975]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[03:52:59.335 --> 03:53:02.336]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[03:53:02.877 --> 03:53:07.118]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[03:53:07.658 --> 03:53:12.820]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[03:53:13.400 --> 03:53:17.641]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[03:53:17.921 --> 03:53:23.943]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[03:53:24.363 --> 03:53:25.604]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[03:53:26.004 --> 03:53:32.105]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[03:53:32.486 --> 03:53:34.106]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[03:53:34.506 --> 03:53:37.068]  I want listeners to really let this sink in.
[03:53:37.128 --> 03:53:37.808]  Think about it.
[03:54:05.205 --> 03:54:07.066]  Think about it long and hard.
[03:54:11.568 --> 03:54:20.773]  If the founding fathers discovered that the government was putting toxins in the water to brain damage them and make them more docile and pliable, would they get angry?
[03:54:21.693 --> 03:54:30.358]  Would your grandfather or your great-grandfather get violently angry if they were radiating food that destroys the food value and feeding it to his kids?
[03:54:31.147 --> 03:54:31.807]  Or grandkids?
[03:54:32.528 --> 03:54:35.529]  Would they get angry if hundreds of chemicals were being put in their water?
[03:54:36.609 --> 03:54:39.351]  Would they be angry if viruses were being sprayed on their meat?
[03:54:39.711 --> 03:54:39.971]  Yes.
[03:54:40.691 --> 03:54:51.716]  The reason you're not angry, and the reason you're not like your grandparents or their parents, is because for at least 60 years, toxic chemicals have been put in your food and water.
[03:54:53.197 --> 03:55:03.606]  I have Times of London articles where the British and Australian government would ship rice with toxic sedatives on them and sterilants to Asia.
[03:55:04.427 --> 03:55:05.708]  This has been going on forever.
[03:55:06.069 --> 03:55:12.174]  You have a scientific dictatorship that does whatever it wants, whenever it wants to you.
[03:55:13.155 --> 03:55:14.216]  The denial is over.
[03:55:14.316 --> 03:55:18.380]  And because we've been exposing them, they know you're docile, they know you're partially drugged.
[03:55:19.628 --> 03:55:24.470]  You can still fight through it, get yourself cleaned up, then you'll feel your normal anger, come back.
[03:55:25.131 --> 03:55:27.892]  That anger is to motivate you to get yourself out of a bad situation.
[03:55:28.372 --> 03:55:44.300]  And so now they're going, that's right, lithium, that's right, Prozac in the water, statins in the water, that's right, we're irradiating your food, that's right, we're spraying viruses on it, that's right, we're feeding you GMO crops that sterilize everything that's fed it, that's right, that's right, mercury's good for your baby.
[03:55:47.125 --> 03:55:53.626]  And I'm running out of time, but if you search engine the term, FDA says melamine not harmful, then you read the article.
[03:55:53.666 --> 03:55:54.686]  In fact, do that real fast.
[03:55:55.086 --> 03:55:56.587]  FDA says melamine not harmful.
[03:55:57.127 --> 03:56:01.008]  Remember a couple years ago, all the Chinese plastic and food was killing people and making them sick?
[03:56:02.088 --> 03:56:05.188]  So the FDA just came out and said, we're just going to say it's not bad for you.
[03:56:07.289 --> 03:56:08.249]  What will they say next?
[03:56:08.309 --> 03:56:10.869]  Jumping off a 500 foot cliff and it isn't bad for you?
[03:56:12.470 --> 03:56:13.730]  They think you're stupid.
[03:56:13.950 --> 03:56:14.230]  Are you?
[03:56:16.417 --> 03:56:17.678]  I meant to get into health care.
[03:56:20.700 --> 03:56:22.861]  Senate health bill passes major test.
[03:56:22.921 --> 03:56:24.923]  Health plans on collision course in the House.
[03:56:25.964 --> 03:56:32.028]  Washington Times reports Senate, White House foes of health care are birthers, right-wingers, and Aryan groups.
[03:56:32.548 --> 03:56:34.169]  So this is a way to demonize anybody.
[03:56:34.429 --> 03:56:36.010]  You don't want government-run health care.
[03:56:36.030 --> 03:56:38.512]  A big insurance company scam.
[03:56:39.613 --> 03:56:40.974]  Oh yeah, the big banks are behind this.
[03:56:40.994 --> 03:56:41.634]  That's on record.
[03:56:41.654 --> 03:56:42.555]  Their stocks are way up.
[03:56:43.676 --> 03:56:45.117]  Even the socialists don't want it now.
[03:56:46.240 --> 03:56:47.642]  They're finding out it's a scam on them.
[03:56:47.682 --> 03:56:48.302]  It's a rip-off.
[03:56:49.063 --> 03:56:50.605]  You have a banker bailout, it's a rip-off.
[03:56:50.645 --> 03:56:52.327]  You have global warming taxes, it's a rip-off.
[03:56:52.567 --> 03:56:53.748]  You have government health care, it's a rip-off.
[03:56:53.988 --> 03:56:54.969]  Everything's a rip-off!
[03:56:55.310 --> 03:56:57.152]  Everything's to consolidate wealth and power.
[03:57:01.158 --> 03:57:02.860]  Please warn everybody you know about this.
[03:57:03.180 --> 03:57:04.702]  Please reach out to your friends and family.
[03:57:04.962 --> 03:57:07.545]  Tell them about the free podcast at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:07.845 --> 03:57:09.307]  They can get it off the listen page.
[03:57:09.487 --> 03:57:13.832]  Listen to how they want, when they want, or the local AM and FM, or XM, or however you're listening to us.
[03:57:14.313 --> 03:57:19.899]  Tell people how to listen, because we're the show that covers the facts and is really waking people up.
[03:57:21.806 --> 03:57:24.147]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect, but we're doing the best job we can.
[03:57:24.167 --> 03:57:25.748]  I want to thank the crew and tell them great job.
[03:57:25.768 --> 03:57:30.069]  Before I have one final point, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's show possible.
[03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:31.870]  One of them is Supernatural Silver.
[03:57:32.210 --> 03:57:35.311]  People everywhere are discovering the power of silver salt technology.
[03:57:35.812 --> 03:57:39.373]  This information should be on all major news outlets, but I don't see anybody covering it.
[03:57:39.813 --> 03:57:43.917]  You can find out for yourself why the powers that be are suppressing this groundbreaking technology.
[03:57:43.937 --> 03:57:45.419]  You ought to see all the peer-reviewed stuff they've got.
[03:57:45.779 --> 03:57:47.361]  By SupernaturalSilver.com.

[03:58:03.360 --> 03:58:06.162]  And finally I want to tell you about my solar backup.
[03:58:06.222 --> 03:58:08.764]  Great little solar power generator system.
[03:58:09.565 --> 03:58:14.208]  And you can find out more about that by calling toll-free 877-327-0365.
[03:58:18.882 --> 03:58:20.964]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:21.044 --> 03:58:22.625]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:44.417 --> 03:58:48.659]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:48.959 --> 03:58:49.579]  Number one.
[03:58:49.879 --> 03:58:53.040]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:58:53.301 --> 03:58:53.881]  Number two.
[03:58:54.161 --> 03:58:58.703]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:58:59.043 --> 03:58:59.503]  It's true.
[03:58:59.803 --> 03:59:04.345]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:04.665 --> 03:59:05.206]  Number 3.
[03:59:05.486 --> 03:59:08.769]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:09.070 --> 03:59:12.814]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
