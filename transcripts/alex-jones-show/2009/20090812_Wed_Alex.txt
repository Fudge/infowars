[00:00:01.078 --> 00:00:04.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:14.426]  We've got two hours and 52 minutes left of this live transmission.
[00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:22.952]  In about five minutes, Steve Quayle is joining us to cover the latest flu pandemic information and how that's being used as the pretext for takeover of the country.
[00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:25.295]  We'll be going over that.
[00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:28.557]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, the Associated Press, TV stations, they're all attacking me today.
[00:00:28.577 --> 00:00:33.418]  I told you the feds were gonna come out and say that militias work with white supremacists and they're gonna attack the government.
[00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:55.625]  And then, the feds are gonna attack themselves.
[00:00:56.145 --> 00:01:01.268]  Just like Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag to crack down on the public and arrest people instead of a police state.
[00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:03.789]  The feds did the same scripting before.
[00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.951]  They bombed themselves in 95, and that's been confirmed in FBI documents.
[00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:11.813]  Now there's sworn affidavits from Larry Nichols.
[00:01:13.547 --> 00:01:15.869]  They are definitely coming after us, okay?
[00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:21.052]  And every time the Southern Poverty Law Center opens their mouth now, it's me.
[00:01:21.492 --> 00:01:22.873]  I'm their number one target now.
[00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:27.977]  They are coming after me, Ron Paul, and Oath Keepers, but first Alex Jones.
[00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:28.557]  And you know why?
[00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:32.240]  Because I know what they're doing, I know their ball game, and it freaks them out.
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:42.182]  And when I keep pointing out to you that we know they're ballgame here at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, that's so people will pay attention to what we're saying and what we're doing.
[00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:45.123]  You see the big guns of the enemy going up against us.
[00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:47.584]  We are the challenge of the New World Order.
[00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:48.524]  I'm in God's hands.
[00:01:49.024 --> 00:01:54.706]  They don't want to kill me because that would underline everything I've said, everything I've done.
[00:01:56.104 --> 00:02:00.707]  Just like the Southern Poverty Law Center, page after page demonizing me, we've got it highlighted.
[00:02:00.747 --> 00:02:01.608]  Let's zoom in on this.
[00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:08.372]  For PrisonPlanet.TV viewers watching that aren't just listening on the radio, if they kill me, it'll underline my name.
[00:02:08.752 --> 00:02:12.454]  Just like we've highlighted it here in this Southern Poverty Law Center report.
[00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:19.739]  Because we know about the cancer viruses and the vaccine, and now we're pushing it out in the mainstream news.
[00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.080]  With top scientists.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.921]  We know how to defeat them.
[00:02:26.962 --> 00:02:28.604]  We understand their ballgame.
[00:02:29.244 --> 00:02:31.066]  We understand what they're doing.
[00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:35.330]  But that doesn't mean they still might not set me up or crush me.
[00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.111]  They're very bold.
[00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:38.213]  Like, I'm not challenging the elite to kill me.
[00:02:38.593 --> 00:02:39.454]  I know you don't care.
[00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:43.958]  I'm just laying out the facts here.
[00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:49.407]  And for most people in the government, most people in life, this is not good for us.
[00:02:49.427 --> 00:02:51.708]  99% of us, this is not good for us.
[00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.411]  It's less than 1% that this corruption is beneficial for.
[00:02:56.891 --> 00:03:00.153]  There's 6,000 super gophers, super managers, the elite.
[00:03:00.473 --> 00:03:05.756]  Rothkopf, head of the Kissinger Group, wrote a best-selling book last year, wrote articles for the Washington Post.
[00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:12.040]  World government, global carbon taxes, neo-feudalism, 6,000 elitists working for less than 20 families.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.681]  This is not my opinion.
[00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:14.762]  This is a fact.
[00:03:15.482 --> 00:03:19.746]  And all these years we warned people, and they laughed at us and said we were kooks.
[00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.027]  Now it's all come true.
[00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.469]  Our credibility's shooting up at all-time highs.
[00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.712]  And I knew this Joker poster situation.
[00:03:27.893 --> 00:03:37.962]  Well, when they said you're not allowed to, it's bad, it's racist to show Obama in a bad light, punch up my article that Paul Watson did where it shows Bush as the Joker, Bush as a vampire.
[00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:41.466]  The article's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:47.949]  It's exercising First Amendment, now vandalism as corporate media attacks Obama joker contest.
[00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:57.096]  Florida news station attempts to chill free speech and intimidate political activists by claiming that putting up flyers is a criminal offense.
[00:03:58.197 --> 00:04:01.120]  And then we have the flyers and news, there it is, with Bush.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.441]  Bush is a vampire, Bush is a joker.
[00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:08.846]  The Village Voice itself said it's okay to show Bush as a vampire, but not Obama!
[00:04:10.643 --> 00:04:12.885]  By the way, we had a big copy of that Village Voice poster.
[00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:14.206]  We bought one from the Village Voice.
[00:04:14.707 --> 00:04:16.969]  Hanging up in our office, the old office.
[00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:23.374]  Got lost in the move or somewhere in a box, but... You know, we're against these puppets, these New World Order people.
[00:04:23.975 --> 00:04:25.957]  So we criticize Bush, we criticize Obama.
[00:04:26.177 --> 00:04:29.360]  I make a film, The Obama Deception, and expose him as a puppet.
[00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:32.422]  But he enjoys lying to people.
[00:04:32.462 --> 00:04:34.204]  He enjoys reading off those teleprompters.
[00:04:34.224 --> 00:04:35.085]  He does make me sick.
[00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:37.487]  But he's still just a puppet and I wish him no harm.
[00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:40.353]  The establishment knows this.
[00:04:40.593 --> 00:04:41.894]  Now, watch the newscast.
[00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:44.294]  Look at these women, the looks of concern.
[00:04:44.554 --> 00:04:46.375]  You know, they're talking about some gun owner getting arrested.
[00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:51.656]  They smile and say it's good, but if they're talking about the First Amendment, oh, it's so scary.
[00:04:51.676 --> 00:04:55.357]  And they finally got somebody somewhere to put one on a post office box.
[00:04:55.377 --> 00:04:57.218]  So they got to, oh, federal offense.
[00:04:57.258 --> 00:05:00.278]  And then color of law, blur the lines.
[00:05:00.338 --> 00:05:02.039]  They're experts at that and mix it in with
[00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.661]  Oh, and on PowerPolls, you'll get arrested.
[00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:08.884]  Don't do it anywhere, but in the same article we've got right here, look at that.
[00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:10.786]  Lost Cat.
[00:05:11.887 --> 00:05:13.328]  Let's punch up the actual article if we can.
[00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:14.329]  Lost Cat.
[00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.412]  Professional football franchises hiring.
[00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:19.914]  A yard sale.
[00:05:20.014 --> 00:05:21.075]  Are they going to arrest?
[00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:23.617]  Are they going to go to a yard sale and arrest them?
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.422]  See, this is ridiculous.
[00:05:29.594 --> 00:05:37.962]  So, hundreds of people all over the world, from Ireland to California, from Texas to Moscow are putting these up.
[00:05:38.222 --> 00:05:41.386]  And they're putting up Gordon Brown's and putting Infowars.com on it.
[00:05:41.646 --> 00:05:44.489]  And they're putting up Putin's and putting Infowars.com on it.
[00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.312]  They're putting up... I saw some Japanese version with Infowars.
[00:05:48.392 --> 00:05:50.474]  I can't... I don't even know who the guy is in the diet.
[00:05:51.297 --> 00:05:52.618]  The establishment is scared.
[00:05:52.638 --> 00:05:53.079]  So look at them.
[00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:54.280]  Oh, it's so scary!
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.667]  It doesn't matter that the Florida CPS has kidnapped tens of thousands of kids and admits three plus thousand are missing.
[00:06:00.687 --> 00:06:06.172]  It doesn't matter that Florida is totally corrupt and the government is collapsing and $23.7 trillion has been stolen.
[00:06:06.453 --> 00:06:08.695]  What matters is, is this Alex Jones!
[00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:09.196]  Here it is!
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.262]  Barack Obama, they're being hung all over the city of Claremont.
[00:06:13.282 --> 00:06:14.863]  Have many residents outraged?
[00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:21.168]  Yeah, that's because the posters look like this and whoever is posting them is using anything from staples to glue to do it.
[00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:23.930]  I would assume this morning's Darlene Jones is live in Claremont.
[00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.673]  And Darlene, this is more than a political statement.
[00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:27.493]  It's vandalism.
[00:06:28.694 --> 00:06:29.435]  It is vandalism.
[00:06:29.475 --> 00:06:33.518]  You can see that someone had stapled the signs to this utility pole here.
[00:06:33.558 --> 00:06:34.198]  Stop right there!
[00:06:34.218 --> 00:06:35.640]  Residents obviously upset about this.
[00:06:36.528 --> 00:06:42.714]  See what they did yesterday is they went and found one on a post office box.
[00:06:44.115 --> 00:06:46.718]  And then the next day it's now power poles.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.882]  And that pole is covered with nails.
[00:06:50.942 --> 00:06:53.084]  If you look on it, everybody puts them up.
[00:06:54.755 --> 00:06:59.198]  Well, I bet everybody here has put a sign up for a garage sale or a lost dog or cat.
[00:06:59.978 --> 00:07:01.059]  Or you find a dog.
[00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:06.883]  I mean, my wife always sees some dog wandering around or some cat that's got a thing around its neck but no tag.
[00:07:07.163 --> 00:07:09.504]  She'll go around and put... Arrest her!
[00:07:09.664 --> 00:07:10.024]  It's over!
[00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:10.585]  Go to prison!
[00:07:11.977 --> 00:07:20.104]  So again, this is the chilling effect, but people are all on this local news site saying, we saw stuff of Bush as the devil all over Florida, and who didn't see him?
[00:07:20.364 --> 00:07:21.345]  You know, you didn't care then.
[00:07:21.365 --> 00:07:25.068]  Again, the left is always worst about free speech.
[00:07:25.128 --> 00:07:26.589]  They love going after free speech.
[00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:27.189]  Here it is.
[00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:39.742]  The posters are on street signs, telephone poles, and someone was bold enough to put them up on mailboxes at the Claremont's post office, which is a federal crime.
[00:07:40.082 --> 00:07:47.607]  He looks so mean and gruesome and evil, and this is not something that you want to, as an American, to portray your president, no matter what you think.
[00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:49.888]  You know, that's very disrespectful.
[00:07:49.948 --> 00:07:53.650]  The signs depict President Barack Obama as the Joker or Clown.
[00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.393]  Residents have filed reports with the local police and called the city demanding they come down.
[00:07:58.473 --> 00:08:04.557]  I'd like to know who the person is making all these payments to tell you the truth so they can get at least part of the punishment.
[00:08:04.677 --> 00:08:10.561]  Known radio talk show host and internet personality Alex Jones is encouraging people to videotape themselves.
[00:08:11.101 --> 00:08:11.902]  Did you hear that?
[00:08:12.662 --> 00:08:15.704]  Notice they slowed it down where I was blinking my eyes, making me look like I'm retarded.
[00:08:17.085 --> 00:08:21.748]  They got every trick in the book going here where they slow it down right where I'm blinking.
[00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.390]  So it's like, Alex Jones,
[00:08:26.118 --> 00:08:29.500]  I mean, you guys are just... And then this guy says, I need to be arrested.
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.401]  The guy saying do this, he needs to be punished.
[00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:32.982]  This guy isn't even American.
[00:08:33.022 --> 00:08:33.562]  Listen to him.
[00:08:34.202 --> 00:08:35.603]  I mean, why did you come to this country?
[00:08:35.643 --> 00:08:37.684]  Probably because you live in a police state somewhere, right?
[00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:39.706]  Where there's sewage running down the street?
[00:08:39.906 --> 00:08:40.706]  Hit pause on it.
[00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:45.088]  I mean, you know, I'm glad you're here, buddy, but, you know, don't try to destroy the Bill of Rights.
[00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:46.749]  It's the only thing protecting you.
[00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.751]  And this woman right here, she doesn't... I'm not going to play it all.
[00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:51.292]  It's up on InfoWars.
[00:08:51.432 --> 00:08:52.312]  We got three of them.
[00:08:52.713 --> 00:08:54.754]  And now there's national reports pouring in.
[00:08:56.772 --> 00:08:58.333]  Ladies and gentlemen, we do a contest.
[00:08:58.373 --> 00:08:59.433]  We say, follow the laws.
[00:09:00.513 --> 00:09:02.194]  Put them up where other posters are put up.
[00:09:02.574 --> 00:09:07.076]  Power poles, light poles, downtown areas where people put up other posters.
[00:09:07.936 --> 00:09:17.559]  But see, they don't care if you put up your rock band or your church or your lost cat or your yard sale or your hiring ad or, you know, that there's a hamburger place down the street.
[00:09:18.219 --> 00:09:22.261]  They only care about political messages.
[00:09:23.081 --> 00:09:25.644]  And it's so mean, you're not allowed to show him bad.
[00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:28.627]  Now that's just our total American history and our spirit.
[00:09:29.128 --> 00:09:37.097]  So now somebody's faxing the men with swastikas on them, and I guarantee you that's somebody connected to the Southern Poverty Law Center or some group like that.
[00:09:37.117 --> 00:09:38.719]  I mean, they've been caught over and over again.
[00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:40.160]  Let's go to Steve Quayle.
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.025]  Steve, I got you on about the flu last week, but the whole police state and what's happening.
[00:09:45.137 --> 00:09:50.202]  I've got all these news reports demonizing myself, you, Ron Paul, countless other people.
[00:09:51.843 --> 00:09:53.885]  They are really getting scared right now.
[00:09:54.185 --> 00:10:06.336]  Meanwhile, major German publications, German TV, German radio, and Bild.de, one of their biggest, most prestigious magazines, about cancer viruses in the vaccine, top researchers.
[00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:08.418]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[00:10:08.498 --> 00:10:10.760]  They are really concerned about us, Steve.
[00:10:11.308 --> 00:10:27.437]  Well they are, Alex, and I've got to share something with you because I want to open my sharing with your listeners with a letter I got that's only a paragraph from a career police officer of 35 years who sent out your Obama deception videos to everybody he knows, including senators and congressmen.
[00:10:27.797 --> 00:10:30.279]  Now, let me read this to you, Alex, because this is critical.
[00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:33.541]  He said, thank you, Steve, so much for the program on Coast to Coast.
[00:10:33.581 --> 00:10:34.442]  You were so enlightening.
[00:10:34.562 --> 00:10:37.824]  I'm a police officer and have been so for 35 years.
[00:10:38.024 --> 00:10:40.225]  Everything you say is absolute truth.
[00:10:40.646 --> 00:10:47.771]  It's a shame the news media is bought off, and the only way you can get this info is through people like you and George that aren't afraid of the government.
[00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:50.552]  We have lost so many rights as citizens of this country, it's frightening.
[00:10:50.592 --> 00:10:55.616]  It's like the Hollywood movie, Wild in the Streets, made in the 60s, about when people get our age, they are euthanized.
[00:10:55.896 --> 00:10:56.776]  Here's what he says, Alex.
[00:10:56.856 --> 00:11:01.718]  I'm stockpiling ammo, food, because I truly believe when they finally take the guns away from the U.S.
[00:11:01.738 --> 00:11:06.941]  citizens, the next thing they will do is kill all law enforcement officers.
[00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:15.044]  There is no doubt in my mind that we'll go through the government computer bank and we'll get their names and addresses of all of us and destroy us and our families.
[00:11:15.524 --> 00:11:18.509]  He says, do not surrender your weapons ever.
[00:11:18.789 --> 00:11:21.233]  That's the only thing that's keeping us around as a country.
[00:11:21.554 --> 00:11:27.403]  I sent an email, the Obama deception, to everyone I know including two senators and a congressman that I personally know.
[00:11:27.503 --> 00:11:30.247]  Every citizen should email that clip to their congressman.
[00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:32.110]  Stay there, Steve.
[00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:41.337]  And for those that know about Stalin and Mao and Hitler and the East Germans and Castro, the first group they go after is the cops.
[00:11:41.397 --> 00:11:48.263]  They kill about 30% on average, they put another 30-40% in prison, and then 20% they keep on the payroll.
[00:11:48.523 --> 00:11:50.064]  But normally only a few years.
[00:11:50.645 --> 00:11:54.868]  So the first people they're going to go after, after you've followed orders, is you.
[00:11:55.409 --> 00:11:55.989]  Good point.
[00:11:56.129 --> 00:11:56.910]  We'll be right back.

[00:12:57.975 --> 00:13:03.296]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:04.017 --> 00:13:09.358]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:13:09.898 --> 00:13:16.040]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.221]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:18.341 --> 00:13:20.743]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:13:20.823 --> 00:13:31.751]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:13:34.002 --> 00:13:35.263]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:35.663 --> 00:13:37.064]  It's about a one world government.
[00:13:37.524 --> 00:13:43.907]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:13:52.711 --> 00:13:53.852]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:54.272 --> 00:13:55.473]  The people strike back.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.981]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:14:00.402 --> 00:14:05.869]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:14:06.449 --> 00:14:06.950]  That's right.
[00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.553]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:14:09.874 --> 00:14:17.042]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:14:17.583 --> 00:14:25.287]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:14:25.727 --> 00:14:30.589]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:14:31.209 --> 00:14:36.231]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:37.012 --> 00:14:41.134]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:14:41.534 --> 00:14:41.774]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:46.558]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:14:46.878 --> 00:14:47.159]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:47.539]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:53.767]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[00:15:06.001 --> 00:15:06.361]  I don't know.
[00:15:28.206 --> 00:15:28.746]  I think so.
[00:16:02.544 --> 00:16:11.151]  We're going to get into the police state, the cancer viruses and the vaccines, mainstream German news.
[00:16:12.251 --> 00:16:16.355]  We're going to cover it all, coming up today with Steve Quayle.
[00:16:17.536 --> 00:16:20.818]  And in the next hour, we're going to open the phones up for Steve Quayle at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:16:25.802 --> 00:16:32.129]  We're not opening them up until about 40 or 50 after.
[00:16:32.149 --> 00:16:32.410]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:16:33.151 --> 00:16:34.893]  You can respond to anything you want to discuss.
[00:16:34.913 --> 00:16:36.635]  The demonization campaign against us.
[00:16:37.416 --> 00:16:39.979]  Them coming out and saying, get ready for the militias to attack.
[00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:44.264]  That's your cue for the feds to bomb their own facilities.
[00:16:45.538 --> 00:16:47.281]  I mean, we're entering an incredible time.
[00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:49.786]  Steve, you're finishing up that police officer's letter.
[00:16:50.066 --> 00:16:51.148]  You said you have one more.
[00:16:51.268 --> 00:16:52.270]  I get a lot of these letters, too.
[00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.715]  In fact, the guys brought me in a great one yesterday.
[00:16:54.755 --> 00:16:58.481]  I never got to, but yeah, people are really waking up.
[00:16:59.568 --> 00:17:03.629]  And that's good, because the police are really starting to see what's happening.
[00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:03.949]  Go ahead.
[00:17:04.129 --> 00:17:05.889]  Right, and Alex, I want to make it clear.
[00:17:06.269 --> 00:17:14.991]  The time frame, we can't validate the fact that on the 22nd through 26th of August, there's going to be specifically a bank holiday.
[00:17:15.031 --> 00:17:21.892]  But when it's being talked about on multiple continents, by multiple sources, through multiple information sources, whether it's somebody who knows somebody.
[00:17:22.272 --> 00:17:24.192]  The friend of a friend stuff isn't what I'm interested in.
[00:17:24.212 --> 00:17:27.733]  It's the guys who are in banking and captains of banking and industry.
[00:17:28.513 --> 00:17:32.056]  Well, talking about a bank holiday may stop it though, too.
[00:17:32.096 --> 00:17:33.197]  Yes, now listen to this.
[00:17:34.598 --> 00:17:37.761]  Steve, and this is coming from someone very well connected, okay?
[00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:44.366]  Camp San Luis Obispo is training thousands of snipers for civilian unrest and to aid the police.
[00:17:45.026 --> 00:17:54.034]  I know this from people that are in that, uh, I'm kind of paraphrasing this so I don't give anybody's, uh, you know, uh, give them away, in that sector.
[00:17:54.614 --> 00:18:02.837]  He said that, listen to this too, he confirmed that they're training troops and that it was indeed to aid the police with the problems that the police cannot handle.
[00:18:03.277 --> 00:18:07.458]  He told me that he is planning on getting out of California as soon as possible.
[00:18:07.518 --> 00:18:17.181]  Also, a friend of mine went target shooting in the National Forest last week and told me, this is in California, that the fishing game was searching vehicles and taking all weapons if ammo was present.
[00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:18.341]  They are out of control.
[00:18:18.441 --> 00:18:19.942]  A line needs to be drawn in the sand.
[00:18:20.382 --> 00:18:23.424]  And say no more and don't cross her out.
[00:18:23.444 --> 00:18:25.505]  Now let's get to the poster campaign.
[00:18:25.545 --> 00:18:27.786]  Look, you did not start that campaign.
[00:18:28.186 --> 00:18:29.607]  You reported on a campaign.
[00:18:29.647 --> 00:18:38.552]  Now whoever started the Joker poster understands the value of an image and the statement that an image can make over all the arguments in the world.
[00:18:38.752 --> 00:18:41.273]  We saw the movie B for Vendetta.
[00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:46.896]  The thing that I think is riling the powers that be is now is that the whole
[00:18:47.296 --> 00:18:58.124]  This country is being brought into this and I was listening to the news broadcast and the man saying that whoever is responsible for this, listen, you did not start this campaign.
[00:18:58.584 --> 00:19:08.592]  And the police asking whoever started it to please turn themselves in is like basically the most inane statement in the world because Alex, let me share this with your listeners.
[00:19:09.012 --> 00:19:13.114]  I am so concerned, so worried about the next two to three weeks.
[00:19:13.594 --> 00:19:19.756]  Listen, ladies and gentlemen, this is not a hyperbole when military is training all across the country.
[00:19:20.177 --> 00:19:22.017]  And by the way, I'm going to stop you, Steve.
[00:19:22.478 --> 00:19:23.538]  This is not your opinion.
[00:19:23.558 --> 00:19:26.479]  I keep getting emails saying you and Steve are making this up.
[00:19:26.739 --> 00:19:38.264]  The Pentagon has announced that they've got Homeland Brigades for domestic ops and the governors were in the Associated Press, in fact, print that again for me, on Sunday saying
[00:19:38.664 --> 00:19:41.286]  We don't like the Department of Defense power grab.
[00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.907]  What is this martial law?
[00:19:43.167 --> 00:19:45.528]  And they've already threatened Congress with martial law.
[00:19:45.908 --> 00:19:47.409]  And they're having military drills.
[00:19:47.749 --> 00:19:49.710]  And the governor of Tennessee said, stop it.
[00:19:49.931 --> 00:19:52.032]  And the Pentagon said, sit down and shut up.
[00:19:52.372 --> 00:19:53.733]  This is really going on.
[00:19:53.753 --> 00:19:55.534]  The time for denial is over.
[00:19:55.914 --> 00:19:57.816]  Yeah, and I've got to tell you something, Alex.
[00:19:57.856 --> 00:20:00.017]  The difference is now we're no longer warning.
[00:20:00.057 --> 00:20:04.321]  We're giving up-to-the-minute reports until the time they shut you off.
[00:20:04.401 --> 00:20:06.082]  Until the time they shut me off.
[00:20:06.382 --> 00:20:10.305]  Ladies and gentlemen, neither Alex Jones or I or anybody else is suicidal.
[00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:12.427]  So that's just total BS.
[00:20:12.507 --> 00:20:13.568]  And I want that clear.
[00:20:13.928 --> 00:20:17.130]  That the identification, vilification, now you're being vilified.
[00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:21.273]  Next step, Alex, is nullification and then destruction.
[00:20:21.313 --> 00:20:24.316]  But I'm saying this to all the devils that are out there.
[00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:32.960]  You have absolutely everything to fear from the living God, and nothing to fear from the truth, except the fact that you'll be exposed.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:46.606]  And Alex, I'm telling you point blank, you don't know this, but there is a cadre of intercessors, I'm talking about people who really do know how to pray, who really do pray, praying for your safety, my safety, and our safety, that people will get it.
[00:20:46.666 --> 00:20:51.728]  Now the shills from hell, okay, who send you those statements saying that it's our opinions,
[00:20:52.268 --> 00:20:59.833]  I don't spend hundreds of thousands of dollars like you do a year to basically go out and post my opinion.
[00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:01.334]  We post news stories.
[00:21:01.374 --> 00:21:02.535]  We post editorials.
[00:21:02.815 --> 00:21:03.736]  We post blogs.
[00:21:03.956 --> 00:21:05.417]  We detail, detail, detail.
[00:21:05.457 --> 00:21:14.263]  The thing that's different about us and the Shills is the Shills only watch the vomit brokers on mainstream TV or those inane lady reporters.
[00:21:14.323 --> 00:21:16.124]  They think somehow they've got it together.
[00:21:16.704 --> 00:21:26.236]  You know, when I get the emails, you and Alex, or you and me, individually, together, whatever, the bottom line is that those are either disinformation agents or just denialists.
[00:21:26.336 --> 00:21:29.880]  And Alex, we are now at a full-scale red alert.
[00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:32.103]  There are too many things happening.
[00:21:32.123 --> 00:21:32.744]  There are too many
[00:21:33.624 --> 00:21:34.424]  Steve, stay there.
[00:21:34.585 --> 00:21:35.485]  I agree with you.
[00:21:35.505 --> 00:21:38.826]  I mean, I've been saying get ready for him to demonize the militias.
[00:21:39.186 --> 00:21:41.607]  That's in preparation for staged terror attacks.
[00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.748]  Ladies and gentlemen, what are you now seeing?
[00:21:44.188 --> 00:21:46.748]  We are entering the vortex right now.
[00:21:47.569 --> 00:21:48.469]  We're on the march.
[00:21:48.969 --> 00:21:50.570]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.191]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:57.093 --> 00:22:02.079]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:06.103]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:06.323 --> 00:22:11.910]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:12.671]  It's true.
[00:22:12.871 --> 00:22:17.815]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:18.215 --> 00:22:23.660]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:22:24.501 --> 00:22:27.163]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:22:27.404 --> 00:22:30.827]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:22:31.928 --> 00:22:35.531]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:41.256]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[00:22:57.401 --> 00:22:59.984]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:23:00.405 --> 00:23:05.372]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:23:05.732 --> 00:23:07.474]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:23:07.795 --> 00:23:12.381]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:23:12.761 --> 00:23:13.742]  How much do you want?
[00:23:13.942 --> 00:23:14.702]  When do you want it?
[00:23:15.083 --> 00:23:16.683]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:23:16.964 --> 00:23:17.784]  When will you need it?
[00:23:18.044 --> 00:23:20.105]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:23:20.245 --> 00:23:21.346]  Will there be any food?
[00:23:21.586 --> 00:23:22.907]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:23:23.107 --> 00:23:28.170]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.552]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:35.434]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:23:35.774 --> 00:23:36.755]  How much will you need?
[00:23:36.995 --> 00:23:37.616]  We don't know.
[00:23:37.896 --> 00:23:38.797]  How much do you want?
[00:23:38.998 --> 00:23:39.738]  All you can get.

[00:25:29.877 --> 00:25:31.740]  Take care, my friends.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.861]  When you go, you go.
[00:25:32.881 --> 00:25:34.203]  Death's 100%.
[00:25:35.284 --> 00:25:37.467]  But what lives forever is your deeds.
[00:25:37.547 --> 00:25:43.234]  And I'm just so thankful that I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:47.931]  Steve Carell's our guest.
[00:25:47.951 --> 00:25:48.852]  We'll go back to him in a moment.
[00:25:48.872 --> 00:25:53.958]  Even though all this craziness is going on, we continue spreading the word like we never have before.
[00:25:54.059 --> 00:25:57.062]  And we've got the white ones, the black ones, they're all in.
[00:25:57.343 --> 00:25:58.123]  Sold out last week.
[00:25:58.143 --> 00:25:58.964]  We've got more in.
[00:26:00.837 --> 00:26:02.979]  The black ones are actually the best seller right now.
[00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:06.281]  The second best seller are the white ones with socialism on them.
[00:26:06.781 --> 00:26:10.143]  The black ones with fascism are the number one seller, but here it is.
[00:26:10.183 --> 00:26:11.384]  Look, I meant to wear one of these today.
[00:26:11.424 --> 00:26:12.125]  I will tomorrow.
[00:26:12.845 --> 00:26:14.606]  I like to wash shirts first before I wear them.
[00:26:15.127 --> 00:26:15.967]  Socialism!
[00:26:16.027 --> 00:26:16.608]  There it is!
[00:26:17.188 --> 00:26:24.456]  You see, when they came out and said it should be illegal to put these up and the person should be arrested a week and a half ago, I said, well, I'm going to stand up for the First Amendment.
[00:26:24.776 --> 00:26:27.539]  We'll put up some free flyers, ask folks to print them up, put them out.
[00:26:27.979 --> 00:26:29.280]  People said you ought to do a contest.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.685]  We said, okay, whoever puts up the most in public legal places, you'll win $1,000.
[00:26:33.745 --> 00:26:34.205]  Second place, $500.
[00:26:35.066 --> 00:26:35.507]  Third place, $200.
[00:26:35.707 --> 00:26:39.111]  And that contest and the rules are up on Infowars.com.
[00:26:39.151 --> 00:26:39.951]  Big banner right there.
[00:26:40.819 --> 00:26:46.983]  And then, I started getting demonized by publications and news for it, and now they're saying I need to get arrested.
[00:26:47.323 --> 00:26:50.085]  Not just whoever put them up in Florida, but I need to be arrested.
[00:26:51.265 --> 00:26:54.948]  And it's always some foreigner, can't even speak English, saying, arrest him now!
[00:26:54.968 --> 00:26:56.809]  I mean, these people make me sick!
[00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:59.951]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, next they'll want to arrest you for this shirt.
[00:27:00.311 --> 00:27:02.192]  We've got to not give in to the chilling effect.
[00:27:02.612 --> 00:27:07.095]  We've got to take action and say no to them and their system.
[00:27:08.137 --> 00:27:11.098]  Because if you don't stand up for something, you will lose it.
[00:27:11.398 --> 00:27:13.239]  On the back, it's got InfoWars.com.
[00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:14.819]  There's a bunch of different variants.
[00:27:14.939 --> 00:27:22.262]  One just says InfoWars.com, some say In The Fed, some of the t-shirts say Wake Up Before It's Too Late, or Stop The Criminal, InfoWars.com.
[00:27:22.742 --> 00:27:24.843]  So a bunch of different variants in black and white.
[00:27:25.163 --> 00:27:29.884]  They say fascist, they say InfoWars.com, they say New World Order, they say socialism.
[00:27:30.285 --> 00:27:32.705]  You know, whatever your view is, all these are bad isms.
[00:27:33.406 --> 00:27:37.007]  We've got the shirts, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:43.381]  We do tell folks, like we've been saying from the start, be sure you put this in areas that are legal and lawful to post them.
[00:27:45.141 --> 00:27:47.622]  According to this Florida town, you can't put it on a power pole.
[00:27:47.642 --> 00:27:48.823]  You can put a lost cat up.
[00:27:49.383 --> 00:27:50.804]  You can put a yard sale up.
[00:27:50.884 --> 00:27:53.344]  You don't put something unflattering.
[00:27:53.725 --> 00:27:54.725]  That is illegal.
[00:27:55.185 --> 00:27:57.126]  Worshipping the President is the only way.
[00:27:57.606 --> 00:28:00.107]  Our veterans have fought and died so that you don't have free speech.
[00:28:02.031 --> 00:28:07.014]  But again, and then there's all the films you can also get at Infowars.com, not just the t-shirts.
[00:28:07.034 --> 00:28:27.528]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, Generation Rx about the drugging of the kids, Endgame, the whole eugenics plan, Anthrax, War, about the race-specific bioweapons, the Obama deception that you heard Steve Quayle talking about, get them all at Infowars.com, or watch them in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, and we even have the evil Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[00:28:28.368 --> 00:28:30.049]  With Infowars.com on the back.
[00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:37.996]  The establishment really hates this, and this is how we fund our operation to continue standing up against the New World Order.
[00:28:38.676 --> 00:28:41.038]  Speaking of supporting people, folks, you need to support Steve Quayle.
[00:28:41.378 --> 00:28:43.180]  His website is stevequayle.com.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.802]  Just Google Steve Quayle, best-selling author and researcher.
[00:28:45.822 --> 00:28:47.103]  We'll tell you about those before he leaves us.
[00:28:47.523 --> 00:28:49.165]  Okay, enough of my interruptions, Steve.
[00:28:49.725 --> 00:28:51.927]  I want to take calls in the next hour when you're on with us.
[00:28:52.667 --> 00:28:55.550]  Continuing what you're saying, the next few weeks, next few months,
[00:28:56.972 --> 00:29:00.575]  Red Alert, he's losing a couple of percentage points a week.
[00:29:00.735 --> 00:29:02.836]  I heard a rebroadcast, I said a day.
[00:29:02.936 --> 00:29:05.518]  I say things wrong sometimes, but I always correct it.
[00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:11.022]  He's gone from 80 plus points, slowly dropping, the last two weeks losing two or three points a week.
[00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:13.303]  Most polls show him in the mid to low 40s.
[00:29:14.664 --> 00:29:17.026]  The ones they throw around say 50, 49.
[00:29:17.446 --> 00:29:19.307]  Gallup, Rasmussen shows below 50.
[00:29:21.161 --> 00:29:22.042]  What are they going to do?
[00:29:22.082 --> 00:29:23.923]  I mean, he's a puppet, but he's the puppet.
[00:29:24.203 --> 00:29:26.205]  They've got their whole agenda behind.
[00:29:26.925 --> 00:29:36.272]  So, uh, I see them having to stage a terror attack or a shooting or something to demonize these grassroots people that are coming.
[00:29:36.372 --> 00:29:37.953]  And, you know, they open up the doors and
[00:29:38.874 --> 00:29:46.463]  95% of people are booing and screaming and saying, I'm not partisan, I wasn't paid to come here, I don't want cap and trade, I don't want socialist healthcare.
[00:29:46.483 --> 00:29:47.464]  Obama's lying.
[00:29:47.744 --> 00:29:49.807]  He's been caught lying about what's in the bill.
[00:29:50.167 --> 00:29:51.388]  People have gone over that now.
[00:29:51.829 --> 00:29:57.336]  I mean, I see a total loss, like I've never seen, of confidence in this criminal and his controllers.
[00:29:58.464 --> 00:29:59.947]  And that's why I see them now.
[00:29:59.967 --> 00:30:04.434]  I knew they were going to have to come out and say militias and gun owners are going to kill you.
[00:30:04.935 --> 00:30:06.478]  The DHS report is real.
[00:30:06.778 --> 00:30:07.780]  The veterans are evil.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.224]  Now they're saying that...
[00:30:11.078 --> 00:30:13.940]  The veterans are white supremacists and are going to bomb federal buildings.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.081]  They did that last time before they bombed themselves.
[00:30:17.521 --> 00:30:19.923]  So that's why I see us going into total red alert.
[00:30:20.183 --> 00:30:20.723]  Steve Coyle?
[00:30:21.063 --> 00:30:37.312]  Well, we are at red alert, Alex, and the thing that led me to believe that, or lead me to believe that, is the fact of paratrooper, paratroop drops in the rain north of Cincinnati, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, WAFB Channel 9, talking about the parachute drops.
[00:30:37.372 --> 00:30:39.133]  I mean, not only that, but I'm getting
[00:30:39.873 --> 00:30:40.593]  I don't know.
[00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:12.318]  I am so absolutely in a period of turmoil, because when I say this, you can no longer just go by the information, waiting for more information.
[00:31:12.718 --> 00:31:14.259]  You've got to get prepared.
[00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:20.784]  And I'm telling everybody I know, Alex, I dealt most of yesterday with people telling me they've got to get out of where they're at.
[00:31:20.864 --> 00:31:23.566]  I'm telling people that they'd better start moving now.
[00:31:24.146 --> 00:31:26.208]  If you live east of the Mississippi,
[00:31:26.548 --> 00:31:33.490]  You should be looking at mountain places where maybe some old tourist hotels, when I say old, tourist hotels that are unoccupied during the fall.
[00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:39.071]  Go in the winter, go up and rent a place, but get out of where you're at, especially if you've got high visibility.
[00:31:39.371 --> 00:31:49.453]  I can tell you this, the veterans have heeded my warning, and there are certain things I don't say publicly that they know that can be validated through their own channels.
[00:31:49.553 --> 00:31:51.074]  A lot of them have already left the country.
[00:31:51.454 --> 00:31:52.994]  I will tell your listeners this,
[00:31:53.394 --> 00:32:08.807]  Now look, it's not what I pretend to know, it's that people who do know let me know when I'm on, because contrary to popular belief, there are still some great people out there that are fighting behind the scenes and dying behind the scenes to basically bring the information to the public.
[00:32:09.067 --> 00:32:18.955]  There has been a war declared on the intelligence community of years ago, especially those that still believe in the Constitution, still believe in their oath, and the Constitution now is vilified.
[00:32:18.975 --> 00:32:21.777]  In these town hall meetings, you cannot bring up the Constitution.
[00:32:21.797 --> 00:32:22.798]  You bring up the Constitution,
[00:32:23.078 --> 00:32:26.302]  That's a one-way ticket out of a meeting usually by pretty burly thugs.
[00:32:26.742 --> 00:32:27.823]  You can count on me.
[00:32:27.843 --> 00:32:34.590]  And by the way, we're seeing them beat up women, beat up men, beat up blacks that are against Obama because they really don't like that image.
[00:32:34.631 --> 00:32:37.313]  They want to make it that it's all racist to divide us.
[00:32:38.355 --> 00:32:44.922]  Grabbing old men on TV with Spectre and then saying that we're the ones doing it when on video it's them.
[00:32:45.506 --> 00:32:47.927]  Well, I think that people have got to understand something.
[00:32:48.307 --> 00:32:49.708]  They control the images.
[00:32:50.128 --> 00:32:51.508]  They control the speech.
[00:32:51.988 --> 00:33:00.392]  That's why they hate free speech, because see Alex, what's happening now, people have finally been able to say, look it, I no longer have a job.
[00:33:00.832 --> 00:33:06.634]  I no longer have my 401k IRA, where I used to have enough money to retire on, and now I'm being told,
[00:33:07.034 --> 00:33:10.257]  I may get to die at 65 because of a health panel.
[00:33:10.297 --> 00:33:14.600]  And by the way, it's interesting, isn't it, that even they... Those death panels are in there!
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:20.725]  I've got videos, we've played them, of Rahm Emanuel's brothers saying that he's a bioethicist board.
[00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:24.168]  They say in the documents that they're going to ration care.
[00:33:24.622 --> 00:33:28.064]  Well, and again, ration care, that's eugenics, my brother.
[00:33:28.085 --> 00:33:30.066]  That is absolutely what's going on.
[00:33:30.086 --> 00:33:31.507]  And by the way, they hate that word.
[00:33:31.527 --> 00:33:35.850]  See, they accuse anybody who says, look what they're doing is being Nazis.
[00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:43.295]  And I can say, by the way, your wording is out of a direct speech given by Dr. Mengele.
[00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:44.296]  In one case, it was.
[00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:48.039]  So when I see these people saying that anybody who is contesting their
[00:33:48.499 --> 00:33:50.201]  Do what we say, not as we do.
[00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:55.707]  Oh, okay, well you take the health care provisions offered, even the President himself wouldn't answer that question.
[00:33:56.068 --> 00:34:03.156]  So you see, the elitists and the socialists, ah, let's just get rid of that socialist word, the communists, the luciferians,
[00:34:03.616 --> 00:34:03.777]  Are you?
[00:34:19.577 --> 00:34:23.620]  At San Luis Obispo for the eventual uprising.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:29.425]  That's why the local police are being told that Vietnam veterans and all veterans are potential terrorists.
[00:34:29.485 --> 00:34:33.008]  That, you know, people that quote the Constitution Bill of Rights.
[00:34:33.048 --> 00:34:33.808]  How dare we?
[00:34:34.269 --> 00:34:35.470]  Well, listen, we dare.
[00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.293]  And what we're trying to do is save your rear ends in the whole battle.
[00:34:39.313 --> 00:34:40.694]  Because let me share this, Alex.
[00:34:40.794 --> 00:34:43.716]  It is a given that once the
[00:34:44.717 --> 00:34:46.739]  Powers of B have been utilized.
[00:34:47.099 --> 00:34:51.242]  Local law enforcement, National Guard, and willing military, they all die too.
[00:34:51.342 --> 00:34:52.343]  And that's what we're fighting for.
[00:34:52.363 --> 00:35:01.189]  You see, we're trying to not only fight evil against those who are coming against everything that freedom is based on, but we're also trying to protect their families.
[00:35:01.209 --> 00:35:12.717]  And like the law enforcement officer who sent me that letter stated, he knows, 35 year veteran in law enforcement, that they're going to use his family, first of all, as a hostage, and then basically they're on the targets too.
[00:35:15.921 --> 00:35:16.902]  It's problematic.
[00:35:16.982 --> 00:35:23.747]  It's absolutely astonishing to me that most people do not get the fact of the lateness of the hour.
[00:35:24.148 --> 00:35:26.450]  I'm getting emails right now while I'm on the air with you.
[00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.371]  Are you going to put up your red screen?
[00:35:28.391 --> 00:35:32.174]  My red screen will simply say, it is time to head to the hills.
[00:35:32.234 --> 00:35:33.015]  This thing is on.
[00:35:33.355 --> 00:35:33.856]  Go for it.
[00:35:33.876 --> 00:35:35.617]  Do I know that they'll keep the internet up?
[00:35:35.878 --> 00:35:36.118]  No.
[00:35:36.518 --> 00:35:41.402]  And again, what I'm trying to do, Alex, is just... I see the difference is that there is no
[00:35:42.583 --> 00:35:45.706]  When I say this, there is no hope of turning it around in my eyes.
[00:35:46.026 --> 00:35:50.029]  There is a hope of getting people to recognize that they need to turn and repent.
[00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:56.554]  See, across the land, there is not one voice, maybe one or a couple, saying that people need to repent in this land.
[00:35:56.634 --> 00:36:00.437]  If people would repent, turn back to God, then things could be different.
[00:36:00.497 --> 00:36:01.578]  But I don't see that.
[00:36:01.718 --> 00:36:09.224]  And see, the deal is that just withstanding the New World Order, you cannot stand against a supernatural force in human force.
[00:36:09.284 --> 00:36:10.045]  It cannot be done.
[00:36:10.484 --> 00:36:17.847]  Well, Steve, you're right, but in every other nation, tyrants take over and they do this, and they really are building FEMA camps.
[00:36:17.887 --> 00:36:21.268]  They really are admitting NORTHCOMS to take over the governors.
[00:36:21.909 --> 00:36:27.631]  I really do have The Hill and the Associated Press, governors oppose DOD emergency powers.
[00:36:28.672 --> 00:36:40.077]  A bipartisan pair of governors is opposing a new Defense Department proposal to handle natural and terrorism-related disasters, contending that a murky chain of command can lead to more problems than solutions.
[00:36:41.337 --> 00:36:43.198]  But they're really whitewashing this.
[00:36:43.678 --> 00:36:44.659]  Well, they're whitewashing it.
[00:36:44.699 --> 00:36:50.741]  Look, the deal is that we're all hearing, and when I say we're all hearing, your sources are different from mine.
[00:36:51.121 --> 00:36:55.223]  People feed you, feed me, but there are people that I know that you've never met and vice versa.
[00:36:56.906 --> 00:36:57.708]  Well, it's not even that!
[00:36:57.768 --> 00:37:03.882]  They're openly announcing that the main target is the governors in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act!
[00:37:04.278 --> 00:37:28.162]  I agree, but you see Alex, when you and I say that, even though you put it up on your InfoWars.com site, I put it up on SteveQuayle.com, it doesn't matter if George Norrie has you or I or anybody on, it's that the people that absolutely go to work from 9 to 5 or basically looking for a job from 9 to 5 are not getting the true news because that's why they're putting the full court
[00:37:28.502 --> 00:37:32.284]  Well, what I'm saying is there's no doubt the feds are trying to take over.
[00:37:32.544 --> 00:37:40.729]  But this is not Russia, Tsarist Russia, or, you know, the poor peasant, you know, Chinese culture, good people, but they'd always been slaves.
[00:37:41.269 --> 00:37:46.532]  This isn't, this Soviet takeover, and that's what it's more akin to, isn't going to work with all these guns.
[00:37:47.012 --> 00:37:48.893]  And I see their whole agenda stalling.
[00:37:49.254 --> 00:37:53.616]  I see them staging terror attacks just to maintain and hold on, Steve.
[00:37:53.656 --> 00:37:56.958]  You're saying you really think they're going to still go for a hot war?
[00:37:57.655 --> 00:37:58.339]  Absolutely.
[00:37:58.862 --> 00:38:00.170]  Absolutely they're going for it.
[00:38:00.412 --> 00:38:01.016]  Absolutely.
[00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:11.189]  Because look, Alex, you don't start killing generals in the National Security Agency for the people that are not aware that they have a military hierarchy in the NSA.
[00:38:11.489 --> 00:38:19.335]  You don't start killing them when some of them break ranks and say, look, we're not going to partake in the death of 25 to 50 million Americans.
[00:38:19.375 --> 00:38:20.316]  You know, it's interesting, isn't it?
[00:38:20.336 --> 00:38:23.939]  Henry Kissinger's an old guy, but he said basically old people have got to go.
[00:38:24.059 --> 00:38:26.141]  In other words, they've got to be put away.
[00:38:26.161 --> 00:38:27.502]  Listen, these are Kissinger quotes.
[00:38:27.802 --> 00:38:31.265]  You could do a whole show on nothing but quotes of the elitist.
[00:38:31.565 --> 00:38:34.547]  And still people would say, well, gee, I don't know if they're really serious.
[00:38:34.587 --> 00:38:43.534]  Yeah, Obama this morning got up with Sotomayor and lied and said, you know, there's nothing in there to restrict your health care when it's in there!
[00:38:43.895 --> 00:38:44.095]  Right.
[00:38:44.215 --> 00:38:45.996]  Well, forgive me, but I doubt he's read it.
[00:38:46.537 --> 00:38:56.585]  And I pretend, and based on, you know, some of the statements coming out of the Senators and Congressmen who have voted for it, they have passed it in whatever level of the House.
[00:38:56.645 --> 00:39:00.608]  The bottom line is it just, it still behooves them to read it.
[00:39:01.088 --> 00:39:10.055]  And I think that Arlen Specker making the statement that people who are showing up at these meetings don't represent mainstream America, that's the biggest mistake they made.
[00:39:10.095 --> 00:39:19.141]  The military knows good and well they represent mainstream America, but it's the illusion of the politicians that have been bought and have been basically compromised.
[00:39:19.161 --> 00:39:19.782]  Look, it's simple.
[00:39:19.842 --> 00:39:22.264]  A bunch of offshore banks came in, took over.
[00:39:22.324 --> 00:39:23.685]  Their philosophy is eugenics.
[00:39:23.725 --> 00:39:25.046]  That's their excuse to do what they do.
[00:39:26.366 --> 00:39:29.190]  The very banks funded Hitler, Stalin, Mao on record.
[00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:30.812]  I've had top historians on.
[00:39:30.852 --> 00:39:31.973]  It's a historical fact.
[00:39:32.534 --> 00:39:41.285]  Carol Quigley, Georgetown's political science head, Bill Clinton's mentor, wrote for the State Department, CIA, a true history from the 1920s.
[00:39:43.508 --> 00:39:58.547]  to 1968 called Tragedy and Hope, Rothkopf writes books, Rockefeller writes books, they all brag and I want the military and police that aren't awake yet and the public to know you can differ about when they're going to launch it or what's going to happen or what's going to go on.
[00:39:58.587 --> 00:39:59.689]  The globalists have said
[00:40:01.112 --> 00:40:03.375]  They want a hot revolution.
[00:40:03.415 --> 00:40:04.676]  They want to kill people.
[00:40:04.977 --> 00:40:06.759]  They want to line people up and shoot them.
[00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:12.506]  They want to have all their stupid fluoride head guys in uniforms, you know, their youth brigades running around.
[00:40:12.866 --> 00:40:15.129]  You cannot make the magnitude of this up.
[00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.651]  It's happened everywhere else.
[00:40:16.992 --> 00:40:17.873]  They want to do it here.
[00:40:17.953 --> 00:40:19.254]  And listen, this is real.
[00:40:19.975 --> 00:40:21.196]  They really want to do this.
[00:40:21.236 --> 00:40:24.237]  They really have passed a hate bill to restrict free speech.
[00:40:24.557 --> 00:40:29.220]  They really are trying to pass the Cyberbullying Act that says if you hurt their feelings, you're arrested.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:39.505]  They really are building FEMA camps and Steve Quayle... I want to shift gear to the Fluid because the only thing I think they can launch in October, November that will give them the cover they need...
[00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:48.924]  On top of blowing up federal buildings and blaming on us, the only thing they can do to be able to get this through is going to be the flu.
[00:40:49.684 --> 00:40:55.948]  And they're saying we're at level 6, they're saying forced inoculations, they're saying the army is going to forcibly inject us.
[00:40:56.388 --> 00:40:58.830]  I then get emails saying I'm making it up saying this.
[00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:02.993]  I'm reporting, CNN, Fox, ABC, we've played the clips.
[00:41:04.411 --> 00:41:07.892]  No, because I don't say it's all wonderful that I'm the one reporting all this.
[00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:08.712]  No, I don't know.
[00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:09.972]  I want to share something, Alex.
[00:41:10.032 --> 00:41:28.136]  I've spent a good, pretty much the better part of the last decade, okay, ten years, basically cataloging, investigating, researching the death of the leading bioweaponers and the molecular biologists, immunologists, and the virologists, and a hundred reasons why you should believe that what we're saying is true.
[00:41:28.556 --> 00:41:31.657]  The dead who's who in the world of bioengineering.
[00:41:31.737 --> 00:41:33.377]  David Kelly's death in itself.
[00:41:33.917 --> 00:41:41.502]  Head of Port and Down, Ministry of Defense, British Ministry of Defense, and by the way, the thing is is that this is a virus-shedding vaccine.
[00:41:41.602 --> 00:41:47.046]  How is it that it just seems to come along at the same time as an international financial disaster?
[00:41:47.106 --> 00:41:47.766]  There's no doubt.
[00:41:48.067 --> 00:41:55.472]  We've been telling people that these cloned viruses are connected in with these companies that are killing people in secret trials.
[00:41:55.752 --> 00:42:01.215]  Then we put the London Telegraph up, how they're giving it to homeless people, and they'll give it to 100, and 23 will die.
[00:42:03.897 --> 00:42:09.641]  I mean, you can't make up a death toll like that, and then you read, in fact, let's get to this now when we come back.
[00:42:10.161 --> 00:42:12.403]  Well, finish your point, I'm going to get to this.
[00:42:12.723 --> 00:42:15.365]  The German press is reporting this!
[00:42:16.466 --> 00:42:19.708]  I mean, my God, they're going to inject us with weaponized cancer virus?
[00:42:20.837 --> 00:42:27.481]  Yeah, the thing that people have got to understand is this, is that, look, everything I'm saying, I back it up.
[00:42:27.521 --> 00:42:28.781]  Everything you're saying, you back it up.
[00:42:28.801 --> 00:42:38.386]  But even when we use their sources and they criticize the messenger, the ad hominem attack is absolute prima facie evidence they cannot attack the information they have to attack the messenger.
[00:42:39.066 --> 00:42:40.207]  Well, I just want everybody listening.
[00:42:40.907 --> 00:42:43.869]  Do you have some golden ticket from the elite to get out of all this?
[00:42:43.949 --> 00:42:45.490]  I mean, we're all together.
[00:42:46.684 --> 00:42:50.806]  I mean, there's 6,000 elitists, according to the head of the Kissinger Group.
[00:42:50.826 --> 00:42:51.307]  That's all!
[00:42:51.787 --> 00:42:55.009]  If you're not part of that 6,000, folks, you should stand with humanity.
[00:42:55.029 --> 00:42:56.950]  Don't say you haven't been warned.
[00:42:57.916 --> 00:43:03.377]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:43:03.417 --> 00:43:03.937]  and the world.
[00:43:04.217 --> 00:43:07.678]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:43:08.058 --> 00:43:14.299]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:16.359]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:43:16.599 --> 00:43:24.541]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:43:24.821 --> 00:43:29.246]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:43:29.526 --> 00:43:35.072]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:43:35.332 --> 00:43:37.354]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:40.858]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.

[00:43:57.302 --> 00:44:02.606]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:03.086 --> 00:44:10.151]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:44:10.692 --> 00:44:16.856]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:17.276 --> 00:44:19.117]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:19.237 --> 00:44:21.659]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:21.739 --> 00:44:32.685]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:33.325 --> 00:44:34.606]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:36.367]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:36.847 --> 00:44:41.250]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told.
[00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:43.252]  And his real agenda.

[00:44:52.019 --> 00:44:53.180]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:53.601 --> 00:44:54.782]  The people strike back.
[00:44:56.584 --> 00:45:00.186]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:45:00.346 --> 00:45:10.353]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:45:10.493 --> 00:45:12.654]  There is a solution that doesn't involve excessive
[00:45:12.654 --> 00:45:17.716]  If you notice that most times here at these drug ads on TV, they have a list of possible side effects.
[00:45:17.736 --> 00:45:24.058]  I find that if you're going to take something that is, you're trading one problem for five or six other problems, that to me doesn't make sense.
[00:45:24.098 --> 00:45:25.298]  Using something that is natural
[00:45:41.404 --> 00:45:44.727]  That is absorbed into the body, particularly because it's in a liquid form.
[00:45:44.847 --> 00:45:45.988]  I think it's the best way to go.
[00:45:46.068 --> 00:45:49.710]  Call to order your two-month supply of Heart and Body Extract today.
[00:45:49.831 --> 00:45:52.252]  Call 1-866-295-5305 or go to HBextract.com.
[00:45:52.312 --> 00:45:54.554]  We will not be forgotten.
[00:45:54.874 --> 00:45:58.257]  We won't be left behind.
[00:45:58.317 --> 00:46:00.579]  Our memories will hold a mortal mind.
[00:46:14.396 --> 00:46:23.921]  We're going to get the articles updated that are on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with the artist who did the famous street art.
[00:46:25.022 --> 00:46:26.543]  Andre the Giant has a posse.
[00:46:27.763 --> 00:46:31.165]  And then everybody copied that around the country and the world tens of millions of times.
[00:46:31.766 --> 00:46:33.667]  Then he came out with Obey clothing line.
[00:46:34.267 --> 00:46:37.189]  People called him a sellout, but get your political message out.
[00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:38.930]  Unfortunately, it's like communist.
[00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:39.390]  You gotta love it.
[00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:42.452]  It's a communist that makes tens of millions of dollars and has clothing shops, but
[00:46:43.564 --> 00:46:47.325]  That's actually David Rockefeller, you know, his granddaddy said, competitions are sin.
[00:46:48.085 --> 00:46:49.446]  But that's a side issue.
[00:46:51.627 --> 00:46:52.847]  We're happy he's making money.
[00:46:53.327 --> 00:46:55.628]  The issue is he just shouldn't then want to put us in FEMA camps.
[00:46:56.328 --> 00:47:01.930]  But the guy that made the obey signs is the one that made the famous archetypal image of change.
[00:47:04.065 --> 00:47:06.846]  And then Barack Obama sent him a thank you letter.
[00:47:07.267 --> 00:47:11.489]  Dear Shepard, I would like to thank you for using your talent and support of my campaign.
[00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:17.011]  The political message involved in your work have encouraged Americans to believe they can help change the status quo.
[00:47:17.532 --> 00:47:22.654]  Your image has a profound effect on people whether seen in a gallery or on a stop sign.
[00:47:24.375 --> 00:47:28.017]  Oh, Obama wants them to put his image on stop signs, which they were.
[00:47:28.817 --> 00:47:29.858]  In fact, that's what we do.
[00:47:30.118 --> 00:47:37.923]  We write articles showing Obama stuff, and Obama stickers on stop signs, and I've even seen them on mailboxes, and we show that.
[00:47:38.403 --> 00:47:40.385]  So, oh, these criminals are just incredible.
[00:47:40.665 --> 00:47:43.286]  See, they want their speech, but they don't want you having yours.
[00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:45.128]  Or on a stop sign.
[00:47:45.528 --> 00:47:48.170]  I am privileged to be part of your artwork and proud to have your support.
[00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:49.911]  I wish you continued success.
[00:47:50.031 --> 00:47:50.971]  Barack Obama.
[00:47:51.372 --> 00:47:52.973]  Signed by Barack Obama.
[00:47:53.919 --> 00:47:56.280]  They are just such hypocrites with all these newscasts.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:10.324]  And Drudge Post, the posters we put out with Infowars.com, the Joker, our variant of it that's gone viral with our audience taking action, we commend you, and they put it next to a swastika that wasn't part of our image.
[00:48:10.344 --> 00:48:11.845]  They're trying to set us up, folks.
[00:48:12.125 --> 00:48:15.266]  The Southern Law Center hit us this morning and hit us hard.
[00:48:15.566 --> 00:48:16.446]  The AP hit us.
[00:48:17.727 --> 00:48:18.607]  They're coming after us.
[00:48:18.627 --> 00:48:19.087]  You know why?
[00:48:19.407 --> 00:48:21.488]  Mainly because we're talking about this.
[00:48:22.714 --> 00:48:25.056]  Now, this is on German TV, German radio.
[00:48:25.116 --> 00:48:27.358]  We have the reports up on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:27.759 --> 00:48:29.961]  Does virus vaccine increase the risk of cancer?
[00:48:30.321 --> 00:48:33.124]  Then they go on to admit cancer viruses.
[00:48:33.144 --> 00:48:34.865]  We're going to talk to Steve Quayle right now about this.
[00:48:35.306 --> 00:48:38.448]  The swine flu vaccine has been hit by a new cancer fear.
[00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:41.731]  For a German health expert, they have a shock warning about the safety.
[00:48:42.492 --> 00:48:50.658]  Lung specialist Wolfgang Woderig, I want him on, has said that there are many risks associated with the vaccine for the H1N1 virus.
[00:48:51.018 --> 00:48:55.301]  See, these new advanced genetically engineered viruses are really nanotech, folks.
[00:48:55.341 --> 00:49:00.424]  They're very... The new generations like the Gardasil, all those girls it's killing.
[00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:04.967]  Just Google Gardasil deaths and you'll watch them, blood pouring out, everything.
[00:49:05.007 --> 00:49:06.969]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up!
[00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:10.611]  He has grave reservations about the firm.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:17.864]  Novartis, they're the really scary folks, scarier than Baxter, who are developing the vaccine and testing it in Germany.
[00:49:18.304 --> 00:49:20.626]  The vaccination is injected with a very hot needle.
[00:49:23.068 --> 00:49:30.653]  Woodarg said, the nutrient solution for the vaccine consists of cancerous cells from animals, and we do not know if there could be an allergic reaction.
[00:49:31.553 --> 00:49:36.797]  Yeah, we know from the 1920s research the Rockefellers funded, we know what's in it.
[00:49:37.517 --> 00:49:40.920]  Just like Bayer knew what that HIV and hepatitis would do in Factor VIII.
[00:49:42.932 --> 00:49:44.072]  That came out in their own documents.
[00:49:44.112 --> 00:49:45.213]  They did it on purpose.
[00:49:45.853 --> 00:49:46.673]  Why would you do that?
[00:49:46.733 --> 00:49:48.374]  Because they're psychos, folks.
[00:49:49.354 --> 00:49:53.475]  But more importantly, some people fear that the risk of cancer could be increased by injecting the cells.
[00:49:53.495 --> 00:50:03.898]  The vaccine, as Johannes Lohr, president of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, has pointed out, can also cause worse side effects than the actual swine flu virus.
[00:50:03.958 --> 00:50:04.919]  That's the plan.
[00:50:06.039 --> 00:50:08.040]  We've got one minute before we go to break, but Steve,
[00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.833]  Steve Quayle, I mean, this is exactly what you and others have been saying.
[00:50:14.774 --> 00:50:24.402]  Well, again, no one's been saying it longer than I have, and the Spanish flu being re-cultured and brought into the equation, it's not H1N1 that's the issue.
[00:50:24.482 --> 00:50:26.164]  It's not even swine flu.
[00:50:26.524 --> 00:50:33.911]  It's the biological cocktail that these guys have concocted to destroy 5.5 billion people.
[00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:34.892]  By the way, they had a close call.
[00:50:34.912 --> 00:50:35.612]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:50:35.652 --> 00:50:36.253]  Back in one minute.
[00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:39.977]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:46.817 --> 00:50:50.801]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:50:51.061 --> 00:50:52.843]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:50:53.063 --> 00:51:01.351]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:51:01.592 --> 00:51:06.817]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:51:07.137 --> 00:51:08.759]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:15.323]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:51:15.503 --> 00:51:26.250]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.931]  That's right, clean water.
[00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:29.631]  Right from the air you breathe.

[00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:55.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:02.250]  Big Brother.
[00:52:02.931 --> 00:52:03.971]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:04.692 --> 00:52:05.793]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:06.453 --> 00:52:07.253]  You want answers?
[00:52:08.034 --> 00:52:08.954]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:08.975 --> 00:52:13.257]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:13.777 --> 00:52:17.820]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:23.485]  The internet was not really going in 95-96.
[00:52:23.505 --> 00:52:27.726]  There was a few audio screens that they were intermittent.
[00:52:28.586 --> 00:52:31.887]  I didn't hear a steep whale until 96 when I was sent an audio cassette of him.
[00:52:32.887 --> 00:52:37.389]  Then I got him on, and I remember the first interview, I kind of disagreed with him on a lot of points.
[00:52:37.869 --> 00:52:42.150]  He said, they're gonna carry out eugenics, they're gonna put it in a flu vaccine, they're gonna kill you.
[00:52:43.137 --> 00:52:46.320]  And then years later, I've done deep, deep research, made films.
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:47.841]  I realize that's everything.
[00:52:47.861 --> 00:52:48.982]  That's why I respect Steve.
[00:52:49.622 --> 00:52:50.663]  That's what kind of scares me, though.
[00:52:50.683 --> 00:52:59.430]  He gets into other areas that I haven't really researched enough, but I know he's a credible guy, so it kind of freaks me out, some of the other stuff he covers, because I hope that isn't accurate, but...
[00:53:00.587 --> 00:53:05.811]  We know that Steve is very gifted, very intelligent, has a lot of sources, and it's always great to have Steve Quill on with us.
[00:53:05.831 --> 00:53:07.212]  Okay, Steve, you got cut off by the break.
[00:53:08.213 --> 00:53:12.416]  Top German scientist, major institutes, live cancer virus.
[00:53:12.816 --> 00:53:20.522]  We know the cancer, the weaponized cancer program was the name of the AIDS program by the Navy in the seventies.
[00:53:20.602 --> 00:53:23.804]  We know they put it in the vaccines of gay men in New York.
[00:53:23.844 --> 00:53:24.825]  That's declassified.
[00:53:26.567 --> 00:53:28.810]  But then we get demonized saying don't take the shots.
[00:53:29.471 --> 00:53:34.679]  And now here it is in mainstream news that these people are going to be getting cancer viruses.
[00:53:34.719 --> 00:53:35.120]  Go ahead.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.605]  Okay, first of all, I want to give two quotes because I didn't say this.
[00:53:39.386 --> 00:53:44.809]  Dr. Henry Kissinger, world population needs to be decreased by 50%, okay?
[00:53:45.209 --> 00:53:47.030]  War and famine would not do instead.
[00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:53.753]  Disease offered the most efficient and fastest way to kill the billions that must soon die if the population crisis is to be solved.
[00:53:54.233 --> 00:53:56.694]  AIDS is not an efficient killer because it's too slow.
[00:53:57.015 --> 00:54:03.478]  My favorite candidate for eliminating 90% of the world's population is airborne Ebola.
[00:54:03.578 --> 00:54:08.000]  Ebola rest because it's both highly lethal and it kills in days instead of years.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:14.052]  We've got airborne diseases with 90% mortality in humans killing humans.
[00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:15.642]  Think about that.
[00:54:15.702 --> 00:54:17.163]  You know, the bird's poo is good, too.
[00:54:17.183 --> 00:54:19.265]  For everyone who survives, he will have to bury nine.
[00:54:19.285 --> 00:54:26.390]  That's Dr. Eric Pianka, University of Texas, evolutionary ecologist, and lizard expert.
[00:54:26.751 --> 00:54:27.091]  Okay?
[00:54:27.411 --> 00:54:37.159]  Now, Alex, what I've been trying to get across for the decade and a half I've been on talk radio is the fact that, look, they're not happy with a 28% mortality rate.
[00:54:37.479 --> 00:54:40.161]  They want a 90% mortality rate.
[00:54:40.482 --> 00:54:43.164]  The idea is still, in strange, uh,
[00:54:43.684 --> 00:54:46.827]  Language, or language that seems so hard for people to grasp.
[00:54:46.847 --> 00:55:01.261]  The world leaders who everybody looks up to at the CFR and all that, I don't even want to go into that, but if these guys are eugenicists at heart, which they are, if they're making statements that everyone's got to die, which they do, then where are you and I off?
[00:55:01.301 --> 00:55:04.965]  And I challenge the mainstream media to have a roundtable.
[00:55:05.325 --> 00:55:05.885]  Exactly.
[00:55:05.965 --> 00:55:06.805]  I mean, here's the deal.
[00:55:06.845 --> 00:55:12.547]  Don't these stupid reporters in New York on CNN and Fox, don't these FBI guys, don't you all understand?
[00:55:12.967 --> 00:55:15.628]  We're telling you the truth.
[00:55:15.728 --> 00:55:17.108]  We wish this wasn't true.
[00:55:17.489 --> 00:55:19.489]  Believe me, I don't like working 18 hours a day.
[00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:22.810]  I'm sick of this, but I can't get out of this because it's real.
[00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:26.651]  Don't you understand that we're not kooks?
[00:55:26.991 --> 00:55:28.312]  It's all coming true.
[00:55:28.632 --> 00:55:29.292]  It's real.
[00:55:29.632 --> 00:55:31.172]  Mainstream German news.
[00:55:31.272 --> 00:55:32.993]  Cancer viruses in the shots.
[00:55:35.572 --> 00:55:52.365]  No, the thing that people have got to understand, those who are in the FBI, the DHS, the CIA, DIA, DEA, every four letter and whatever letters are out there, this isn't just about your assigned target for the day, Alex Jones, Steve Quayle or whatever, this is about your families.
[00:55:52.765 --> 00:56:05.842]  Because the mutagenic nature of these very biologically, and by the way, this is all done in special compartmentalized intelligence, and A doesn't necessarily know how he's connected to B until he sees all the killing.
[00:56:05.902 --> 00:56:08.565]  That's why the hundred scientists had to die.
[00:56:08.945 --> 00:56:09.987]  Alex, listen to me.
[00:56:10.527 --> 00:56:12.589]  Right now, they're going to go hot.
[00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.930]  Meaning going hot.
[00:56:14.251 --> 00:56:19.075]  I know you and I probably, if there's any place we disagree on, it's the lateness of the hour, okay?
[00:56:19.696 --> 00:56:24.320]  And when I say disagree... No, Steve, I mean, I just believe we can stop it.
[00:56:24.662 --> 00:56:24.942]  I know.
[00:56:25.202 --> 00:56:34.368]  And I would say this, that the powers that be are anticipating the intentional release of the most deadly biological pathogen.
[00:56:34.628 --> 00:56:37.930]  I don't know if the first series of injections... Stay there, stay there.
[00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:40.791]  You're saying the intel you've got is they're going hot.
[00:56:40.911 --> 00:56:41.712]  We'll see when.
[00:56:41.732 --> 00:56:43.893]  I want to get back.
[00:56:43.913 --> 00:56:45.134]  The word we've got is October.
[00:56:45.594 --> 00:56:48.816]  But if we get the word out, I believe they will take the green light off.
[00:56:49.817 --> 00:56:50.677]  We better hope so.
[00:56:50.717 --> 00:56:52.118]  And a lot of you are laughing out there.
[00:56:52.758 --> 00:56:53.839]  Later you may not be laughing.
[00:56:56.707 --> 00:57:01.874]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:57:02.014 --> 00:57:06.380]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:08.403]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:57:08.823 --> 00:57:10.185]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:57:10.445 --> 00:57:11.467]  There is a solution.
[00:57:11.707 --> 00:57:19.731]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:57:56.957 --> 00:58:01.943]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:58:02.163 --> 00:58:05.967]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:06.187 --> 00:58:11.774]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:12.074 --> 00:58:12.535]  It's true.
[00:58:12.735 --> 00:58:17.680]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:23.526]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:58:24.367 --> 00:58:27.029]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:31.474]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:31.794 --> 00:58:35.398]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:58:35.618 --> 00:58:41.121]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:58:41.361 --> 00:58:45.923]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:00.510]  Well, you should.
[00:59:00.851 --> 00:59:05.113]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:59:05.333 --> 00:59:05.833]  That's right.

[00:59:23.503 --> 00:59:30.027]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:59:30.387 --> 00:59:35.590]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[01:00:10.112 --> 01:00:13.754]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.315 --> 01:00:18.397]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.298 --> 01:00:22.280]  We are going to your phone calls in just one moment.
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.342]  Steve Quayle is our guest.
[01:00:26.505 --> 01:00:30.646]  The key to all of this is to understand that only a bioweapon release
[01:00:47.694 --> 01:01:01.360]  Serves the purpose of making everyone suspect in the pretext of lockdown cities bring in federal troops so they can then pose as the savior, set the precedent, make the troops feel like it's okay what they're doing, make the cities feel like it's okay what they're doing.
[01:01:02.221 --> 01:01:07.163]  A total economic collapse can do that, but still the feds get blamed even though they play the part of the savior.
[01:01:08.483 --> 01:01:11.705]  So the globalists are all about scripting and how to pose as the savior.
[01:01:13.154 --> 01:01:20.878]  And we see them, I said back in January and February, I said I'm looking for them to release a controlled flu, but not that the flu would be real.
[01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:24.981]  We said back in April, we don't know if this is real or not, or just hype.
[01:01:25.001 --> 01:01:27.922]  And a lot of scientists are saying this is no big deal.
[01:01:28.302 --> 01:01:30.544]  Some, like Nyman we've had on, do say it's a big deal.
[01:01:31.324 --> 01:01:33.845]  Steve's been saying it's going to be the vaccine that's going to have it.
[01:01:35.006 --> 01:01:41.590]  And a lot of scientists are saying, and they're admitting it has live cancer viruses in it, and cancer cells.
[01:01:42.637 --> 01:01:45.099]  So, we were just reporting on that.
[01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:48.401]  Steve, finish up what you were trying to say.
[01:01:48.541 --> 01:01:54.906]  I'm simply trying to say is that everything you were talking about, you believe that they won't give it the green light.
[01:01:54.986 --> 01:01:56.527]  I'm telling you, they've given it the green light.
[01:01:56.587 --> 01:01:59.429]  Now, let me just have a minute to tell people why, okay?
[01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:03.212]  The thing is, they would not be deploying the military to the extent they have.
[01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:06.114]  They would not have GPS gun owners to the extent they have.
[01:02:06.534 --> 01:02:07.815]  The reports that I'm coming in.
[01:02:07.895 --> 01:02:10.998]  And when I say this, I'm talking eyewitness listeners of yours and mine.
[01:02:11.378 --> 01:02:15.601]  Cobra helicopter gunships over State College last week.
[01:02:15.702 --> 01:02:19.064]  A-10 Warthogs flying low over Cincinnati, metro suburban neighborhood.
[01:02:19.144 --> 01:02:24.068]  No, no, they admit under NLE09, 14 other countries to take over America.
[01:02:24.088 --> 01:02:25.910]  I mean, that's all admitted.
[01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:28.312]  I'm not saying it hasn't been green-lighted.
[01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:30.534]  But we know there's an operation going.
[01:02:30.574 --> 01:02:32.637]  The question is, what is the operation?
[01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:34.319]  And will they fully carry it out?
[01:02:34.439 --> 01:02:36.903]  I agree they're moving the assets into place.
[01:02:37.203 --> 01:02:39.506]  I'm seeing the pre-preparation propaganda.
[01:02:39.946 --> 01:02:40.687]  I agree with you.
[01:02:40.727 --> 01:02:44.352]  I'm just saying, if we stand up and expose it, won't they have to back down?
[01:02:44.412 --> 01:02:45.594]  Or you're saying they can't pull out?
[01:02:46.397 --> 01:02:47.137]  We're good to go.
[01:03:06.944 --> 01:03:07.704]  All the listeners.
[01:03:07.844 --> 01:03:09.505]  I mean, you know, additional listeners.
[01:03:09.645 --> 01:03:10.145]  A lot of them.
[01:03:10.205 --> 01:03:34.510]  But I'm saying this, is look, the thing that's left out of the equation, in my opinion, and because it is a spiritual battle, because these people openly worship Lucifer, having Luciferian human sacrifices, I would say this, do you really think that there is a position in all this argument between all of us and all of them, that the God of Heaven, which America used to worship, acknowledge, and be grateful for, has a
[01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:35.590]  I don't
[01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:55.057]  Nailed with emails, quails talking about God again.
[01:03:55.278 --> 01:03:56.959]  Well, I'm sharing this with people.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:08.190]  If everyone's dying of a vaccine and by simply recognizing the fact that, number one, they don't have to take it, number two, that with sorting all this stuff out, there's so many voices out there.
[01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:10.332]  What repentance is?
[01:04:10.412 --> 01:04:13.654]  In a simple word, thank God, I'm sorry, I've tried to live my life without you.
[01:04:14.034 --> 01:04:18.818]  You know, Alex, you're saying, you just quoted a minute ago, that you're going to live in the house of the Lord forever.
[01:04:18.838 --> 01:04:26.284]  Yeah, but others need to know this too, that God's abiding presence will never... Jesus said he'll never leave us or forsake us, okay?
[01:04:26.624 --> 01:04:30.447]  But the point is that these people that worship Lucifer want us dead.
[01:04:30.808 --> 01:04:34.771]  I do not believe short of repentance on the level of Nineveh.
[01:04:35.251 --> 01:04:44.095]  That this thing can be stopped because the assets, and you know this, you said it on the air, you know, we're, our families are threatened incessantly.
[01:04:44.135 --> 01:04:45.336]  We're threatened incessantly.
[01:04:45.556 --> 01:04:47.337]  We've got spooks on us night and day.
[01:04:47.657 --> 01:04:59.482]  And the deal is, is that they would not be doing that, assigning 1,000 cyber warriors to try and come after you, come after me, if they weren't worried about the one thing that they cannot control.
[01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.703]  And that's God, and God is sympathetic.
[01:05:01.963 --> 01:05:05.165]  Well, I agree with you and I have a personal relationship with the Creator.
[01:05:05.265 --> 01:05:11.889]  My issue is they've created this counterfeit church so when you get into it, people then get pushed into the New World Order system, but you explained that.
[01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:23.477]  But even if somebody's an atheist, we have to admit we're screwed up and admit we're bad and admit this is a sick society and admit that we've got to change our ways or it's only going to get worse.
[01:05:23.557 --> 01:05:24.898]  Things are deteriorating.
[01:05:25.238 --> 01:05:26.739]  Things are getting evil.
[01:05:27.139 --> 01:05:41.025]  Things are falling apart, and it is because we've turned into wicked devils, and the elite know there is a God, and they worship the wicked creation of the Creator, and they really believe in all this.
[01:05:41.065 --> 01:05:46.868]  That's what makes me a believer, is I look at the New World Order, and they are believers, but they're believers on the other side.
[01:05:47.248 --> 01:05:47.908]  Absolutely.
[01:05:47.948 --> 01:05:51.951]  So the issue is not are Alex and Steve just making up stuff.
[01:05:51.991 --> 01:06:05.758]  Why don't people do their homework and recognize that, hey, if they acknowledge that there's a devil and even use the name of Jesus as an anathema, meaning it's forbidden to them, then the bottom line is that maybe someone should consider that there really is more to the spiritual plight.
[01:06:05.778 --> 01:06:09.580]  By the way, Alex, eyewitness reports coming out of Nampa, Idaho.
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:10.801]  Nampa, Idaho, okay.
[01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:19.511]  Confirm hearing foreign commanders ordering local law enforcement officers, EMTs, fire and airport officials in drills in the middle of the night.
[01:06:19.972 --> 01:06:21.714]  Now that's in Nampa, Idaho.
[01:06:21.894 --> 01:06:25.058]  Foreign commanders ordering local law enforcement officers.
[01:06:25.298 --> 01:06:27.962]  Everybody better realize that when who declared a level six
[01:06:28.602 --> 01:06:35.229]  Alert, okay, pandemic, global pandemic alert, that that put us effectively under control of the United Nations.
[01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:36.930]  And guess who the security council is?
[01:06:37.211 --> 01:06:40.133]  Russia, China, U.S., and all the other nations.
[01:06:40.193 --> 01:06:43.437]  So it should come as no surprise that something is afoot.
[01:06:43.757 --> 01:06:45.979]  I do not believe it can be pulled back.
[01:06:46.079 --> 01:06:53.086]  I believe it's gone hot, and I believe the days ahead are going to be the most perilous that this country has ever experienced in its entire life.
[01:06:53.286 --> 01:07:00.654]  You don't think the people going to all the town halls and saying no and the poll numbers plunging will make the establishment back off?
[01:07:00.714 --> 01:07:01.776]  I think if people thought
[01:07:03.757 --> 01:07:08.178]  I think if the establishment thought Obama was still going to be messianic, they were building him up for this.
[01:07:09.239 --> 01:07:14.000]  I just see them, they always try over and over again, and this is their biggest try so far.
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:17.201]  I just don't see it going well for them if they do engage.
[01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:20.702]  Well, and let me say this, I'm not telling anybody not to do those things.
[01:07:20.802 --> 01:07:30.205]  I'm also of the opinion that immediately, those of men, the men and women of means and who have the ability, we should be having recall petitions going out.
[01:07:30.245 --> 01:07:33.346]  But here's the deal, the question then becomes on the other side of it.
[01:07:33.886 --> 01:07:37.330]  Does that even threaten them more to move up their time frame?
[01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:53.207]  I think, Alex, that the bottom line is the advantage of informing people is if we get that extra law enforcement officer, if we get that extra DEA agent, if we get the extra border patrol guy, if we save their families' lives and they finally come to grips with the fact that
[01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:59.031]  Hey, if we're ordered to any part of the United States to be away from our family, who's going to take care of them?
[01:07:59.331 --> 01:08:02.132]  And then they're being told, don't expect any resupply?
[01:08:02.152 --> 01:08:11.058]  I said, listen, ladies and gentlemen, you who take part in the deployment throughout the country in law enforcement to other states have just signed your death warrant.
[01:08:12.186 --> 01:08:19.296]  And by the way, in 1988 they tried to make a federal law where all cable systems and phones, where the feds would dial in and give you messages.
[01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:26.445]  We just put up an Idaho news article, KPAK.com, Idaho officials working on statewide alert system.
[01:08:26.946 --> 01:08:30.267]  Where Homeland Security takes over the radio, the phone, everything.
[01:08:30.727 --> 01:08:39.130]  I told people this in Police State 2000 in 1999, because I work in radio, and FEMA came in and took over and put in their control box where everything goes through them.
[01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:41.911]  It is all really coming together right now, Steve.
[01:08:42.592 --> 01:08:43.192]  And I just...
[01:08:44.389 --> 01:08:50.093]  It's like we're going to have our own Mao Tse Tung here in America and I just wish to God this wasn't the case and I hope we can stop it.
[01:08:50.373 --> 01:08:51.454]  Let's take some phone calls.
[01:08:51.574 --> 01:08:54.616]  Common Side Effects calling from Hawaii.
[01:08:55.357 --> 01:08:56.798]  Never had a caller with a name like that.
[01:08:56.818 --> 01:08:57.518]  Go ahead caller.
[01:08:57.538 --> 01:08:59.780]  Hey, good morning Alex.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:01.321]  Hey, good morning Steve.
[01:09:01.661 --> 01:09:02.041]  Good morning.
[01:09:02.261 --> 01:09:08.065]  Remind people to remind the listeners of May 13th, 1985.
[01:09:10.717 --> 01:09:17.798]  The city of Philadelphia dropped a bomb on the MOVE organization and burned down a whole city block.
[01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:23.800]  Now, a lot of people have been knowing that the government and the system is capable of these things.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:38.323]  Some people have been targeted in the past and, you know, it's been, you know, people haven't come out and really supported these other humans like they really should have in this time of genocide.
[01:09:38.843 --> 01:09:40.283]  Now, as far as Alex,
[01:09:41.092 --> 01:09:43.174]  My personal opinion, I don't think you're racist.
[01:09:43.514 --> 01:09:50.159]  I'm a person of color, and I don't think it really matters if you're racist or not, in all honesty.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:57.245]  I mean, your information is crucial, and certain information that you share with the audience
[01:09:58.058 --> 01:10:01.060]  It doesn't have anything to do with racism.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:11.626]  But a real racist wouldn't make a film like Endgame about how they're targeting black and hispanic babies for abortion and infanticide and injecting black people with syphilis.
[01:10:12.587 --> 01:10:15.008]  It's the people that talk about race all day.
[01:10:15.369 --> 01:10:17.150]  They want to get everybody fighting with each other.
[01:10:18.811 --> 01:10:25.615]  Margaret Sanger and Rockefellers brag how they come up and pose to the community groups to kill you.
[01:10:27.321 --> 01:10:29.823]  Right, and you have been coming out with the crucial information.
[01:10:29.883 --> 01:10:46.717]  Now, not to say that people of color can still, you know, be critical and, you know, because, for instance, the King-Alfred plan and the update of that REC-84 plan, that needs to be read on the air to your million of listeners.
[01:10:47.077 --> 01:10:53.563]  This is an eight-hour plan of how they're going to localize all the enforcement and then come in
[01:10:54.256 --> 01:11:03.643]  And divide up the families, put people in concentration camps, and then their endgame is the mass burn trash incinerators that get up to 5,000 degrees.
[01:11:04.484 --> 01:11:16.713]  That is what they're trying to... This is their final solution, because in Nazi Germany, they were killing 10,000 people a day, and the ash from burning up folks caused a bottleneck.
[01:11:17.054 --> 01:11:20.056]  So it slowed down the production, per se.
[01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:22.491]  Well, God bless you.
[01:11:22.631 --> 01:11:23.911]  Comment side effects.
[01:11:23.971 --> 01:11:26.532]  We've got to go to break, but God bless you and your points.
[01:11:26.632 --> 01:11:27.993]  We're going to come back and take more calls.
[01:11:28.073 --> 01:11:29.734]  Quick comment, Steve Quayle, on what he was saying.
[01:11:29.954 --> 01:11:41.659]  Well, first of all, I agree with what he was saying about the endgame, and that is to basically kill the people and incinerate them and get them out of every form of eyesight possible.
[01:11:41.679 --> 01:11:46.021]  But I think that more importantly, Alex, is that they have an endgame.
[01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:47.821]  And remember, this is the globalists.
[01:11:47.862 --> 01:11:48.782]  This isn't just the
[01:11:53.906 --> 01:11:54.306]  Stay there.
[01:11:54.366 --> 01:11:54.706]  Stay there.
[01:11:54.726 --> 01:11:55.567]  Explain when we get back.
[01:11:56.007 --> 01:11:56.568]  Steve Quayle.

[01:12:57.233 --> 01:12:58.714]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:12:58.914 --> 01:12:59.154]  August 12, 2009.
[01:12:59.214 --> 01:13:00.014]  Gold opened this morning at $9.4560.
[01:13:00.054 --> 01:13:03.176]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7267, $4.8634 for a half-ounce, or $2.4317 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:13:03.216 --> 01:13:03.756]  That's $9.7267, $4.8634, or $2.4317.
[01:13:15.242 --> 01:13:19.003]  Bailout equals market distortions, increased money supply while productivity is going down.
[01:13:19.163 --> 01:13:23.184]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[01:13:23.344 --> 01:13:27.806]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share, paying fat dividends.
[01:13:27.966 --> 01:13:33.308]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leading the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[01:13:33.468 --> 01:13:36.609]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:41.450]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust, or is it time to ensure your hard-earned wealth?
[01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:46.774]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[01:13:46.874 --> 01:13:49.416]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems?
[01:13:49.476 --> 01:13:51.278]  Or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[01:13:51.318 --> 01:13:52.178]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:57.859 --> 01:14:03.164]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:14:03.685 --> 01:14:10.672]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:14:11.273 --> 01:14:17.419]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:14:17.859 --> 01:14:19.660]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.221]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:33.244]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:14:33.885 --> 01:14:35.185]  It's not about left or right.
[01:14:35.565 --> 01:14:36.946]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:14:37.426 --> 01:14:43.648]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:14:44.329 --> 01:14:52.080]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:52.601 --> 01:14:53.742]  The Obama Deception.
[01:14:54.183 --> 01:14:55.365]  The people strike back!
[01:14:57.418 --> 01:14:59.380]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[01:14:59.921 --> 01:15:01.983]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:06.228]  The price of food continues to rise, and the economy continues to falter.
[01:15:06.488 --> 01:15:08.431]  You know that you need to prepare.
[01:15:08.791 --> 01:15:12.275]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[01:15:12.595 --> 01:15:15.659]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:28.247]  At OrganicaSeed.com you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:15:28.567 --> 01:15:30.989]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables!
[01:15:31.289 --> 01:15:31.569]  I think so.
[01:16:00.933 --> 01:16:04.795]  We got a guest coming on in the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[01:16:29.269 --> 01:16:30.470]  Hey Jones, how are you doing?
[01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:32.851]  Hey, I haven't seen you mention this on the website, but
[01:16:56.675 --> 01:17:04.157]  The bill to audit the Fed and the Senate has 23 sponsors and even some big globalists like McCain and both of your senators are co-sponsoring it.
[01:17:04.337 --> 01:17:16.861]  Yeah, we constantly link to the 287 or whatever it is sponsors in the House, the 20 plus in the Senate, and the film I'm making.
[01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:22.102]  I mean, I gotta admit, when I'm spending 8, 9, 10 hours a day just on this film, it's hard to make one of these films.
[01:17:22.562 --> 01:17:25.303]  And we got like four guys in here, five guys total making it.
[01:17:27.682 --> 01:17:38.204]  And it's really me, Rob and Aaron, doing the lion's share of actually the editing of the video, the research, that I don't have a lot of... I mean, I do miss a lot of things, so that's why we are taking your calls, but very, very exciting.
[01:17:39.224 --> 01:17:41.704]  Yeah, and one more thing for Steve.
[01:17:42.105 --> 01:17:46.745]  He really needs to check out that book, The Family, by that Jeff Charlotte that you had on.
[01:17:46.805 --> 01:17:49.586]  That is an amazing expose on the phony Christians.
[01:17:50.686 --> 01:17:51.206]  Absolutely.
[01:17:51.246 --> 01:17:51.926]  Thank you so much.
[01:17:51.966 --> 01:17:53.266]  I appreciate your call, George.
[01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:55.967]  Yeah, all of this is putting heat on the elite, though.
[01:17:56.961 --> 01:18:08.215]  And the fact that everybody is waking up to the New World Order, I want to warn the Feds that they bombed the Oklahoma City building in 95 and demonized the Liberty Movement when Oklahoma passed the law against U.N.
[01:18:08.255 --> 01:18:08.756]  takeover.
[01:18:09.256 --> 01:18:10.778]  That isn't going to work this time.
[01:18:11.099 --> 01:18:12.961]  People now know the New World Order is real.
[01:18:13.301 --> 01:18:16.105]  Steve, how do you see this unfolding?
[01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:21.654]  First of all, I think that they have to go hot because they know that the people are awaking.
[01:18:21.694 --> 01:18:27.896]  The audit, the Fed, listen, you've got control of the nation's money, you've got control of the nation.
[01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:32.297]  That's what lobbyists are, that's what payoffs are, bribery, and when payoffs and bribery don't work,
[01:18:32.697 --> 01:18:33.738]  Then use blackmail.
[01:18:34.018 --> 01:18:37.060]  So that's why I believe things are going to have to go really hot.
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:44.184]  Also, I think people are losing track of the fact that there are extraneous events to us that are taking place right now, i.e.
[01:18:44.544 --> 01:18:45.345]  Israel and Iran.
[01:18:45.465 --> 01:18:46.766]  Now, why is that important to us?
[01:18:47.166 --> 01:18:59.193]  It is my contention that the devils that are that know how to go for what's going on in this country will most likely try and link and sync with a major world event so they can cover up their nefarious deeds.
[01:18:59.253 --> 01:19:02.055]  In other words, a worldwide traumatic event
[01:19:02.555 --> 01:19:09.000]  And you know what Tommy Frank said, the minute a nuclear weapon goes off in the United States, the bottom line is it's all over the Constitution.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:17.826]  It's my, what would you say, learned and calculated thought process that we are going to see multiple events taking place.
[01:19:18.246 --> 01:19:23.328]  And that they will use an international event, whether it's London going up, or D.C.
[01:19:23.348 --> 01:19:45.138]  or New York going up, meaning going up by a nuclear weapon, that it's going to be the ball spike scenario, it's going to be integrated, and listen, Alex, they don't ever intend to give up power, so anytime there's a threat to their power, they have to take the eyes of the awakened off of the events that led up to their awakening and substitute something else.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:55.875]  So what I'm saying is, is they will come up with a false flag, or multiple false flags, tying it into an international event, and then, you know, their killing spree begins in this country.
[01:19:57.386 --> 01:20:05.613]  See, I see them testing the flu to see if they can get people to take the shots, and then beta testing each time for a bigger event.
[01:20:06.034 --> 01:20:11.499]  I see the incremental system where they contract, we push back, they release some of the contraction.
[01:20:11.799 --> 01:20:15.562]  Then they contract again, we push back, they release some of the contraction.
[01:20:15.602 --> 01:20:18.985]  As soon as we give up again, think we've won, they contract again.
[01:20:19.526 --> 01:20:21.608]  That's the technique I see them using
[01:20:23.217 --> 01:20:24.779]  As they try to get control of us.
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.142]  But, I mean, I just hope you're wrong, Steve.
[01:20:27.162 --> 01:20:28.083]  You've been right about a lot of things.
[01:20:28.103 --> 01:20:28.683]  Can I tell you something?
[01:20:28.743 --> 01:20:30.566]  I hope I'm wrong, but you've got to say this.
[01:20:30.586 --> 01:20:31.607]  You said it at the opening case.
[01:20:32.087 --> 01:20:37.794]  I called this one 12 to 13 years ago on how the flu would be utilized as a bioweapon.
[01:20:38.234 --> 01:20:39.876]  You actually did it longer ago than that.
[01:20:39.916 --> 01:20:41.558]  You did it in, well, yeah, 96.
[01:20:41.718 --> 01:20:42.279]  I guess that's 13.
[01:20:44.465 --> 01:21:00.991]  Well, the deal is that all I'm trying to say is that, look, I hope I'm wrong too, but we're seeing too many things taking place that suggest that, look, I go back to that little formula, identification, vilification, nullification,
[01:21:01.551 --> 01:21:04.173]  Excuse me, is that not a hateful thing to say?
[01:21:04.233 --> 01:21:06.095]  But see Alex, it's double standards.
[01:21:06.235 --> 01:21:07.836]  What works for them is acceptable.
[01:21:07.876 --> 01:21:10.418]  What works against them must be put down at all costs.
[01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:29.792]  Well yeah, like Obama says, put his poster up on stop signs.
[01:21:30.492 --> 01:21:34.275]  We're saying don't do that, put it up on legal places and they're saying arrest me.
[01:21:34.995 --> 01:21:38.858]  So you can have the Obama thing as him as hope and change, you can't with me.
[01:21:39.618 --> 01:21:40.439]  Steve, stay there.
[01:21:40.639 --> 01:21:43.361]  More phone calls with Steve Quayle, straight ahead.
[01:21:47.604 --> 01:21:50.585]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:51.526 --> 01:21:54.208]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:57.401 --> 01:22:00.004]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:22:00.405 --> 01:22:05.392]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:22:05.752 --> 01:22:07.474]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:22:07.795 --> 01:22:12.381]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:22:12.401 --> 01:22:12.882]  We're good.
[01:22:31.963 --> 01:22:35.465]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:36.765]  How much will you need?
[01:22:37.005 --> 01:22:37.625]  We don't know.
[01:22:37.906 --> 01:22:38.826]  How much do you want?
[01:22:39.026 --> 01:22:39.746]  All you can get.
[01:22:39.946 --> 01:22:40.787]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:22:41.047 --> 01:22:43.808]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:22:44.088 --> 01:22:47.189]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.990]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:01.567]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:23:01.707 --> 01:23:06.073]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:23:06.233 --> 01:23:08.096]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:09.878]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:23:10.138 --> 01:23:11.180]  There is a solution.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:19.424]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:23:19.824 --> 01:23:26.888]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:23:27.288 --> 01:23:32.931]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:23:33.311 --> 01:23:38.895]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:23:39.335 --> 01:23:43.138]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:23:43.478 --> 01:23:49.702]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:54.245]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:23:56.357 --> 01:24:00.338]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:24:00.598 --> 01:24:02.358]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:24:02.598 --> 01:24:10.860]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:16.342]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:24:16.662 --> 01:24:18.282]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:24:18.522 --> 01:24:24.846]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:24:25.046 --> 01:24:35.791]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:24:36.092 --> 01:24:36.552]  That's right.
[01:24:36.852 --> 01:24:39.174]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:24:39.414 --> 01:24:41.155]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:24:41.235 --> 01:24:41.435]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:24:41.495 --> 01:24:43.857]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:24:44.057 --> 01:24:44.657]  That's acolablue.com.
[01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:16.935]  When Steve Quayle tells you a lot of elitists and a lot of patriots and people are leaving the country, it really is happening.
[01:25:17.015 --> 01:25:18.896]  And I hope we can back the globalist off.
[01:25:18.916 --> 01:25:20.998]  That's why the maximum effort is needed right now.
[01:25:22.178 --> 01:25:25.200]  We are going to continue with your phone calls.
[01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:32.764]  Dan, Alex, Randy, Nanette, and others that are patiently holding, told for a number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:25:38.783 --> 01:25:41.027]  There have been some other big new developments.
[01:25:41.047 --> 01:25:42.730]  A man arrested outside an Obama event.
[01:25:43.531 --> 01:25:46.557]  Loaded guns hours before Obama even showed up.
[01:25:46.978 --> 01:25:48.600]  And actually just nearby in the area.
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:51.345]  So now they're just grabbing gun owners, searching cars.
[01:25:53.291 --> 01:25:56.192]  Does virus vaccine increase the risk of cancer?
[01:25:56.252 --> 01:26:00.013]  Major German news reports live cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[01:26:00.033 --> 01:26:14.756]  But for the next five, six minutes, I want to bring our sponsor up because even though the world is crazy, we'd all continue to go on living and preparing ourselves and trying to save money and also thanking all of our sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[01:26:15.586 --> 01:26:25.391]  And Marty Schachter, World War II vet in the Chemical Corps, came back from World War II with his papa, and now with his son and their family, 60-plus years later.
[01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:28.153]  What's 47 to 2009?
[01:26:28.213 --> 01:26:31.135]  That's almost 70 years.
[01:26:31.155 --> 01:26:31.855]  That's incredible.
[01:26:32.475 --> 01:26:33.716]  Just absolutely amazing.
[01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:55.391]  Marty Schachter joins us, a family-owned business out in Dublin, California, high quality, organic, before organic was cool soap, and he only did factory direct to major hospitals and hotels and wealthy organizations and groups.
[01:26:56.593 --> 01:27:04.901]  Genesis got him as a sponsor, because Michael Trudeau, who used to be a sales manager here, was a fan of organic stuff, and actually an environmentalist, but a conservative one.
[01:27:05.442 --> 01:27:08.245]  Somebody who was still into organic stuff, but not a communist, basically.
[01:27:09.106 --> 01:27:10.567]  And got him as a sponsor.
[01:27:10.627 --> 01:27:11.848]  And I got sent some of the soap.
[01:27:11.928 --> 01:27:13.089]  My wife wanted more and loved it.
[01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:16.453]  And I washed my hair with it, the bar soap, the dishwashing soap.
[01:27:16.493 --> 01:27:17.013]  We use it.
[01:27:17.955 --> 01:27:23.538]  And normally you pay more for organic, you pay less for this than organic, and less than the chemical stuff.
[01:27:23.778 --> 01:27:27.060]  See, the chemical plants with all the oil, they have all this byproduct.
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:31.102]  So they just put it into what you know as detergents and soap, and it really hurts you.
[01:27:32.103 --> 01:27:34.124]  So this is really great stuff, but it's triple concentrated.
[01:27:34.144 --> 01:27:34.864]  Be sure and dilute it.
[01:27:34.884 --> 01:27:38.966]  A lot of people just take it pure and use it.
[01:27:39.046 --> 01:27:41.108]  It's all triple concentrated, that's why it lasts so long.
[01:27:41.408 --> 01:27:45.530]  That's why it's 85% off supermarket prices, and you're not paying for all the additives and fillers.
[01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:47.191]  Marty, good to have you on with us.
[01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:48.871]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:27:48.991 --> 01:27:49.852]  Good to hear from you.
[01:27:50.532 --> 01:27:51.373]  Good to have you with us.
[01:27:52.213 --> 01:27:58.338]  Throw out to folks the tote bag, some of the products, how they get a free brochure, how they order a sampler tote bag.
[01:27:59.419 --> 01:28:04.823]  5starsoap.com is the website, just the number 5 and starsoap or spell it out, 5starsoap.com.
[01:28:05.143 --> 01:28:07.445]  Tell folks just in a nutshell about your fine product.
[01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:11.331]  Well, first I want to say we have a new, improved website.
[01:28:11.932 --> 01:28:15.934]  It's freshly redone, and it makes it much more easier to look at.
[01:28:16.014 --> 01:28:20.817]  Same 5starsoap.com, but you'll really enjoy it.
[01:28:21.178 --> 01:28:31.424]  Now, I hadn't looked at it in the last week, and they just popped it up on screen as we simulcast on prisonplanet.tv, and it looked great before, but it really looks Web 2.0 and awesome now.
[01:28:31.684 --> 01:28:32.285]  That's good news.
[01:28:32.972 --> 01:28:34.273]  Oh yes, we've worked on it.
[01:28:34.313 --> 01:28:38.936]  We want to do it for everybody and we thank for everybody looking at it and enjoying it.
[01:28:39.377 --> 01:28:41.458]  It's something to go forward with.
[01:28:41.959 --> 01:28:43.360]  Like I said, we make soap.
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:52.706]  We've been making soap for 62 years, still doing it successfully, enjoying all the radio listeners calling us up with questions.
[01:28:53.067 --> 01:28:55.228]  We've got all the answers, all the help.
[01:28:55.729 --> 01:29:00.192]  We make bar soap, laundry soap, dish soap,
[01:29:00.845 --> 01:29:01.626]  I don't know.
[01:29:21.918 --> 01:29:27.060]  We've got bulk packages for large families or people that want to take care of their future.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:30.161]  We go from a 1 to 2 year supply to a 3 to 4 year supply.
[01:29:30.181 --> 01:29:34.063]  And our monster package of 4 to 5 year supply for a family of 4.
[01:29:34.123 --> 01:29:35.524]  That's over 200 pounds of goods.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.441]  Keep it on the shelf.
[01:29:44.021 --> 01:29:44.362]  Use it.
[01:29:44.842 --> 01:29:46.723]  It has an unlimited shelf life.
[01:29:47.064 --> 01:29:48.265]  You don't have to worry about that.
[01:29:48.645 --> 01:29:54.950]  But if you want to try the product and really enjoy the future, we have a sample of package.
[01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:57.032]  We call it a one-month supply.
[01:29:57.452 --> 01:29:59.013]  It weighs out about six pounds.
[01:29:59.474 --> 01:30:02.897]  It'll last a family of four, anywhere from four to eight weeks.
[01:30:03.477 --> 01:30:05.599]  It's got four bars of our pure soap.
[01:30:06.133 --> 01:30:07.735]  Nothing like it anywhere.
[01:30:07.755 --> 01:30:13.743]  18 ounces, a little jar of our triple concentrated laundry soap.
[01:30:13.863 --> 01:30:17.908]  Not detergent, soap, but a little tiny measuring scoop.
[01:30:18.667 --> 01:30:24.572]  Sixteen ounces in a dispenser bottle of our triple concentrated cocoa butter shampoo.
[01:30:25.092 --> 01:30:36.021]  Sixteen ounces in a dispenser bottle of our liquid dishcloth soap for washing pots, pans, utensils, all-purpose cleaner, floor cleaner, window cleaner, hands, everything.
[01:30:36.622 --> 01:30:38.643]  All put together with a book of instructions.
[01:30:39.264 --> 01:30:40.385]  Weighs out six pounds.
[01:30:40.745 --> 01:30:41.626]  It's twenty dollars.
[01:30:42.068 --> 01:30:43.109]  It'll get you started.
[01:30:43.469 --> 01:30:44.631]  It'll turn you around.
[01:30:44.971 --> 01:30:46.072]  It'll change your life.
[01:30:46.552 --> 01:30:47.994]  It's a pure fun limit.
[01:30:48.014 --> 01:30:48.634]  Well, exactly.
[01:30:48.654 --> 01:30:50.576]  I mean, everything with a globalist is a rip-off.
[01:30:50.636 --> 01:30:53.719]  And so you pay for a bunch of chemicals, a bunch of salt, a bunch of crud.
[01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:57.183]  Instead, you save money getting the high-quality organic soap.
[01:30:57.223 --> 01:30:58.144]  It's a great thing to do.
[01:30:58.504 --> 01:30:59.705]  We'll put it back up on screen.
[01:31:00.086 --> 01:31:03.729]  5starsoap.com or calbinpuresoap.com.
[01:31:03.769 --> 01:31:05.231]  Either way will get you there.
[01:31:05.871 --> 01:31:06.171]  And it's 800-340-7091.
[01:31:06.191 --> 01:31:06.231]  800-340-7091.
[01:31:06.251 --> 01:31:07.172]  Grab your pen and paper, folks.
[01:31:07.232 --> 01:31:08.893]  You can also get a free brochure by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:31:08.913 --> 01:31:09.293]  Again, that's 800-340-7091.
[01:31:09.313 --> 01:31:12.935]  And, Marty, it's always great having you pop in here on the show.
[01:31:12.955 --> 01:31:13.956]  Give us today's limerick.
[01:31:13.976 --> 01:31:15.176]  A wonderful bird is a bird killer.
[01:31:35.242 --> 01:31:37.822]  His bill can hold more than his belly can.
[01:31:38.783 --> 01:31:44.664]  He can hold in his beak enough food for a week, and I wonder how in the hell he can.
[01:31:52.665 --> 01:31:54.605]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:31:54.665 --> 01:31:56.286]  Hey, Marty, great having you.
[01:31:56.306 --> 01:31:58.426]  800-340-7091 or fivestarsub.com.
[01:31:58.706 --> 01:32:01.427]  Banners up on jonesreport.com and infowars.com.
[01:32:01.727 --> 01:32:02.487]  God bless you, Marty.
[01:32:02.527 --> 01:32:03.267]  Talk to you again soon.
[01:32:03.749 --> 01:32:04.389]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:32:04.449 --> 01:32:05.069]  Talk to you soon.
[01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.549]  Bye now.
[01:32:05.609 --> 01:32:06.190]  There he goes.
[01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:07.270]  What a character.
[01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:12.451]  Sixty-two years and counting running Calvin Purcell on a lighter note.
[01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:30.236]  I want to blitz through calls here with Dan, Alex, Randy, Manette, William, and a few others, but something, you know, I see this stuff everywhere, Steve, and I hope you're wrong, but I understand why you're seeing all this and now you're being followed and all this stuff's going on.
[01:32:30.276 --> 01:32:30.956]  It's happening to me.
[01:32:32.017 --> 01:32:37.607]  And they admit we have army documents that become mainstream news, how Ron Paul and myself are followed by the army.
[01:32:37.947 --> 01:32:38.969]  You say it's happening to you.
[01:32:38.989 --> 01:32:39.630]  I believe you.
[01:32:42.202 --> 01:32:46.565]  Then I see how they go, oh, the Winter Olympics are coming to Canada, there will be martial law in the city.
[01:32:46.585 --> 01:32:54.469]  You know, that's the headline I saw two days ago, one of their big papers, like it's good, and oh, there will be martial law in England for the Olympics.
[01:32:54.509 --> 01:32:58.351]  You know, they're just, they just say now, no rights, no free to speech.
[01:32:58.391 --> 01:33:03.194]  They say, just like China, you'll be arrested if you even have a sign in your window of your house.
[01:33:03.674 --> 01:33:05.115]  And they're now announcing this for the G20
[01:33:07.076 --> 01:33:09.137]  In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that's coming up.
[01:33:10.997 --> 01:33:17.399]  We've got somebody inside National City Bank, National City, saying they're closing the branches there.
[01:33:18.059 --> 01:33:20.500]  I mean, this is just getting crazier and crazier, Steve.
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:23.241]  So, there's no doubt they're trying to bring in tyranny.
[01:33:25.721 --> 01:33:27.582]  I guess we can just argue about the time frame.
[01:33:28.609 --> 01:33:29.429]  Not only the time frame.
[01:33:29.469 --> 01:33:30.970]  I'd say this.
[01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:36.552]  I think everybody should forget the time frame in one sense, Alex, from the standpoint of look what's happening now.
[01:33:36.972 --> 01:33:37.793]  You've been accurate.
[01:33:37.893 --> 01:33:38.513]  I've been accurate.
[01:33:38.573 --> 01:33:39.593]  You've warned about the camps.
[01:33:39.673 --> 01:33:41.194]  I've warned about camps, okay?
[01:33:41.394 --> 01:33:42.254]  They're now being built.
[01:33:42.274 --> 01:33:43.735]  You can go on Google and see them.
[01:33:43.775 --> 01:33:44.955]  You've warned about foreign troops.
[01:33:45.196 --> 01:33:45.496]  You!
[01:33:45.616 --> 01:33:46.516]  It was back in 2000.
[01:33:47.256 --> 01:33:48.177]  Now they're here in mass.
[01:33:48.437 --> 01:33:51.998]  They're not returning home after the national level exercise.
[01:33:52.138 --> 01:33:53.499]  That's the key, okay?
[01:33:53.799 --> 01:33:56.120]  Before, prior years, they did return home.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.382]  You've warned in your endgame video that the Illuminati's plan is for a mass blood sacrifice.
[01:33:59.402 --> 01:34:03.005]  Look, nothing would delight the devil more than 25 to 50 million people butchered in this country.
[01:34:16.690 --> 01:34:21.393]  You know, and again, look at, they're planned, they're out in the media, they control the media.
[01:34:21.793 --> 01:34:25.656]  There is no such thing as truth and fairness, come on.
[01:34:26.316 --> 01:34:34.602]  In the mainstream media, even Glenn Beck and so many of the people that people say, well they're telling the truth, it's not what they say, it's what they're not allowed to say.
[01:34:34.982 --> 01:34:40.426]  And we're actually in a medically declared state of emergency under level 6 of the World Health Organization.
[01:34:40.908 --> 01:34:46.774]  The only logical conclusion, Alex, is now they're going to do what you and I have warned about, and it's hard.
[01:34:46.834 --> 01:34:54.703]  Listen, I understand it's as hard for you and me, having warned about it all these years, to grasp the fact that it's no longer future, it's here.
[01:34:54.923 --> 01:34:57.366]  That's why people need to get their food now.
[01:34:57.466 --> 01:34:59.408]  They need to get whatever they're going to get.
[01:34:59.688 --> 01:35:07.695]  And I tell everybody, and I told some people that came in my store yesterday, if today is the last day that you could go to the store to prepare, how long could you last?
[01:35:07.815 --> 01:35:10.217]  One person said two weeks, one person said two months.
[01:35:10.417 --> 01:35:12.739]  And then they said, but what do we do after that?
[01:35:12.919 --> 01:35:15.641]  I said, after that, the plans are for you to die.
[01:35:15.981 --> 01:35:18.163]  And again, see, this is not warm and fuzzy.
[01:35:18.183 --> 01:35:19.724]  This is not cuddly and cute.
[01:35:20.065 --> 01:35:21.025]  This is reality.
[01:35:21.105 --> 01:35:28.952]  And you quote Stalin, the purges of Stalin, Mao, all of the great destruction that has taken place,
[01:35:29.352 --> 01:35:32.695]  And it didn't happen here because we've had guns and we've been willing to defend ourselves.
[01:35:52.452 --> 01:35:54.814]  Absolutely, and that's why they're going for the guns.
[01:35:54.854 --> 01:35:56.495]  Look, they wouldn't be GPSing.
[01:35:56.856 --> 01:36:01.299]  When I meet someone from Northcom and they tell me that... Hold on!
[01:36:01.359 --> 01:36:07.164]  We were telling them they were GPSing for the census and to mark homes for law enforcement before they even admitted it.
[01:36:07.525 --> 01:36:08.305]  Now they admit it.
[01:36:08.385 --> 01:36:08.786]  Go ahead.
[01:36:08.866 --> 01:36:09.026]  Right.
[01:36:09.446 --> 01:36:12.991]  And when I have someone who, with tears in his eyes, who works for the U.S.
[01:36:13.051 --> 01:36:18.558]  military in a command level, basically saying, Steve, they're going to use the air assets of the entire U.S.
[01:36:18.638 --> 01:36:19.900]  Air Force against a citizen.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:24.766]  That, and I'm telling you this, Alex, you don't just sit there and go, oh, that's nice.
[01:36:24.786 --> 01:36:25.367]  Gee, I hope they do.
[01:36:25.427 --> 01:36:29.649]  No, no, no, Daily Kos said, bragged, we're in control now.
[01:36:29.969 --> 01:36:32.430]  We'll use the Air Force against the American people.
[01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:33.411]  We'll get their guns.
[01:36:33.831 --> 01:36:37.853]  Right, but I said that before that even came out of the Daily Kos, okay?
[01:36:38.273 --> 01:36:39.734]  See, it's not enough.
[01:36:39.814 --> 01:36:40.794]  I don't make this stuff up.
[01:36:40.814 --> 01:36:46.537]  Number one, I don't even know, you know, seriously, if I saw ranks, if I saw enough stars, I'd know it's a general.
[01:36:46.837 --> 01:36:53.460]  But what I'm telling you is when I know people that come in and basically can answer questions that no one can answer except them,
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:37:00.944]  And when they've got tears rolling down their eyes and say, the reason I'm telling you this is because I know that you're trying to save lives.
[01:37:01.264 --> 01:37:07.607]  And when I'm being told that they're leaving the military, and I said, do you mean like leaving, like, you know, going AWOL?
[01:37:07.647 --> 01:37:10.248]  They said, I'll do whatever I have to do to get back to my family.
[01:37:10.489 --> 01:37:17.432]  But I'm not going to take part in the selective, quote his words, carpet bombing of Americans in American cities.
[01:37:17.732 --> 01:37:21.374]  So when I hear of F-16s circling over specific
[01:37:22.175 --> 01:37:32.347]  No, no, we've had Blackhawks, Cobras, Sea Cobras, Chinooks, B-2 Bombers flying over Austin in the last two weeks during NLE09.
[01:37:35.289 --> 01:37:35.950]  Absolutely!
[01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:37.591]  Now they're A-10s and everything?
[01:37:37.671 --> 01:37:45.455]  Look, I was told by a, let's just say someone who hates my guts, he said, we won't even waste a bullet on you, you get a Hellfire Missile.
[01:37:45.936 --> 01:37:49.578]  I said, well you may get your Hellfire Missile off, pal, but you end up in Hell.
[01:37:49.678 --> 01:37:53.360]  And I meant that, not as a sarcastic, you know, gee, what's a good comeback?
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:58.143]  So, the thing that I'm trying to tell you is that, what do they do with the Taliban?
[01:37:58.644 --> 01:37:59.024]  Crap!
[01:37:59.364 --> 01:38:03.908]  They'll send a UAV with hellfires against them, so why is it any different?
[01:38:03.989 --> 01:38:05.210]  Why is it any different, Alex?
[01:38:05.490 --> 01:38:05.930]  It isn't!
[01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:21.145]  It's just that we cannot believe, as Americans who have enjoyed the freedom of our God-given rights, and maybe we shouldn't forget Him, that we had something, and because of apathy, indifference, I'm not talking about you, I'm not talking about me and the others who have carried this fight on for so long,
[01:38:21.485 --> 01:38:32.549]  But because of apathy, indifference, and entertainment, the greatest mind melt, and I could use another word but I won't, medium that's ever been invented, we have been lulled to sleep.
[01:38:32.569 --> 01:38:34.569]  We are in a state of insanity.
[01:38:34.609 --> 01:38:36.870]  Well, bottom line, we've got to wake up or it's going to get worse.
[01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:38.270]  Let's talk to Dan in Texas.
[01:38:38.290 --> 01:38:39.491]  Dan, you're on the air with Steve Quill.
[01:38:39.511 --> 01:38:40.371]  SteveQuill.com.
[01:38:40.631 --> 01:38:40.991]  Go ahead.
[01:38:41.011 --> 01:38:42.872]  Steve's right.
[01:38:43.922 --> 01:38:46.402]  Yeah, right outside a bio-weapons lab, yeah.
[01:39:12.071 --> 01:39:14.515]  And then most of the women in his family died soon after.
[01:39:14.535 --> 01:39:16.197]  Notice they have new outbreaks in the U.S.
[01:39:16.237 --> 01:39:20.563]  and Iraq of troops after they get vaccinated, just like the 76 vaccine.
[01:39:20.583 --> 01:39:20.924]  Go ahead.
[01:39:20.944 --> 01:39:24.449]  So, my suggestion is that Steve's right.
[01:39:24.509 --> 01:39:26.131]  They've already tested it with Gardasil.
[01:39:26.272 --> 01:39:28.475]  They know people will line up and just take this stuff.
[01:39:29.076 --> 01:39:30.917]  So it's going to be easy for them to scare it.
[01:39:30.937 --> 01:39:32.938]  They'll just repackage it into the H1N1.
[01:39:32.958 --> 01:39:41.102]  The labs that can actually see the viruses have very expensive microscopes and they're all under heavy control by the military or the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:39:41.122 --> 01:39:45.964]  Well those that aren't are coming out mainstream news freaking out going this is some kind of bioweapon.
[01:39:46.624 --> 01:39:51.910]  I mean, I've got major German news saying it's got cancer viruses in it and asking, why is this in here?
[01:39:52.291 --> 01:39:55.735]  And they're just going, we're the eugenicists, shut up!
[01:39:56.135 --> 01:39:57.637]  We love you!
[01:39:57.657 --> 01:40:02.863]  I mean, it's just so sick, the stuff they write and talk about.
[01:40:04.142 --> 01:40:21.255]  Well, again, they're going to try and do that, and I'm saying that there's going to be infighting and double-crossing and triple-crossing, betrayal, counter-force war, war within the intelligence community, specific agencies against each other.
[01:40:21.295 --> 01:40:26.879]  By the way, they're killing each other up right and left right now, and for those of you that doubt that, just remember Roland Carnaby and the
[01:40:27.379 --> 01:40:29.761]  Well, why do you think it's coming out on Blackwater now?
[01:40:29.801 --> 01:40:40.407]  We knew about the slaverings with little kids and the sex parties and the wife swapping and how, you know, how the mercs were shipping in weapon systems to sell to the resistance to even have a fake war.
[01:40:40.808 --> 01:40:42.529]  Now it's in federal filings.
[01:40:42.869 --> 01:40:44.770]  This isn't just coming out for no reason.
[01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:47.532]  There is war going on within the New World Order.
[01:40:48.336 --> 01:41:08.951]  Absolutely, and the head of Blackwater, which is now called ZXE, he stepped down and obviously they're coming after him for being involved in murder, but the thing is that obviously when the Illuminati or Elite turn on their own, it's usually based on a change of heart, and I hope that's
[01:41:10.106 --> 01:41:13.729]  Well that's what happened when Lenin went to Stalin, they had a big blood feast.
[01:41:14.209 --> 01:41:31.322]  When Hitler got rid of the SA right when he really got power on February 27, 1933 after he Reichstaged, seven months into office, whenever they run these ops, or a few months into office, excuse me, whenever they run these ops, well you're saying it shows a change of heart.
[01:41:31.683 --> 01:41:37.847]  I've seen that a lot of times be a jump point when they're really getting ready to really start slaughtering, they first kill their own people.
[01:41:38.048 --> 01:41:39.549]  Wait, you're saying it could be good news?
[01:41:40.265 --> 01:41:49.590]  That could be it, too, because, look, if they're hanging him out to dry and they're throwing him to the wolves, it's either for something he knows, something he's done, or something he won't do.
[01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:51.570]  Think about that.
[01:41:51.651 --> 01:41:54.572]  Something he knows, something he's done, or something he won't do.
[01:41:55.252 --> 01:41:59.114]  And I don't know the man, so I can't go beyond, you know, just the stories I've read.
[01:41:59.134 --> 01:42:00.175]  But I will tell you this.
[01:42:00.555 --> 01:42:04.797]  That's a huge red flag right there.
[01:42:06.957 --> 01:42:07.459]  Amazing.
[01:42:07.719 --> 01:42:08.120]  Okay.
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:08.802]  Thank you, Dan.
[01:42:09.243 --> 01:42:11.388]  Alex in Maryland, we'll start your call and hold you over.
[01:42:11.428 --> 01:42:12.030]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:42:13.012 --> 01:42:13.313]  Hello.
[01:42:13.533 --> 01:42:14.074]  Hey, Alex.
[01:42:14.115 --> 01:42:14.415]  How you doing?
[01:42:14.455 --> 01:42:15.057]  How you doing, Steve?
[01:42:15.338 --> 01:42:15.498]  Good.
[01:42:16.414 --> 01:42:19.576]  Good, yeah, I just wanted to say, Alex, keep doing what you're doing, man.
[01:42:19.616 --> 01:42:20.777]  You woke me up this year, man.
[01:42:20.797 --> 01:42:23.638]  I always knew something was fishy and going on, but you woke me up this year.
[01:42:24.339 --> 01:42:26.460]  I just got a quick question and a comment as well.
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.342]  One, I wanted to let you know, I live real close.
[01:42:29.382 --> 01:42:33.244]  I live about six miles away from the Capitol, right here in Maryland.
[01:42:33.264 --> 01:42:43.270]  And about every two weeks or so, you've got officers patrolling the area in my neighborhood, it's a housing neighborhood, around 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock, roaming around.
[01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:56.164]  And, uh, I wanted to say also, uh, do you think, in case we do go to war, if things really hit the fan, that the military start using, uh, uh, people who are in prison just like they did in Vietnam?
[01:42:56.224 --> 01:42:56.665]  Stay there!
[01:42:56.725 --> 01:42:57.145]  Stay there!
[01:42:57.245 --> 01:43:00.206]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:43:00.586 --> 01:43:04.209]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:43:04.509 --> 01:43:07.951]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[01:43:57.475 --> 01:43:58.895]  It is a big idea.
[01:43:58.915 --> 01:44:01.016]  A New World Order.
[01:44:01.716 --> 01:44:06.197]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:44:06.597 --> 01:44:09.378]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:44:09.438 --> 01:44:11.678]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:44:12.218 --> 01:44:14.679]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:44:15.399 --> 01:44:22.721]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:44:25.748 --> 01:44:30.711]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:44:31.192 --> 01:44:34.654]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:44:35.054 --> 01:44:37.556]  The Old Barrier is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:44:37.636 --> 01:44:38.777]  Most people have no idea.
[01:44:38.797 --> 01:44:39.557]  They're not after money.
[01:44:39.577 --> 01:44:40.658]  They have all the money they need.
[01:44:40.878 --> 01:44:41.579]  They're after power.
[01:44:41.859 --> 01:44:42.699]  That's what they're after these days.

[01:44:54.527 --> 01:44:55.588]  You have been warned.
[01:44:55.708 --> 01:44:56.529]  Yeah.
[01:44:56.629 --> 01:45:05.456]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[01:45:05.696 --> 01:45:15.305]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.

[01:46:17.987 --> 01:46:26.350]  In the next segment, before Darrell Rundis joins us, and we've got the gentleman on who had the gun a few blocks away from where Obama was at, the media made a big deal out of that.
[01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:27.710]  He's joining us at the end of the show today.
[01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:41.514]  WESHTV is reporting that people were saying it was a hate crime, a Nazi crime, to put up Obama posters in public places that said New World Order.
[01:46:42.375 --> 01:46:46.136]  Back there, and the police are saying it is not considered a hate crime.
[01:46:47.059 --> 01:46:52.685]  But see, they say under federal rules now they're trying to pass in the House that hurting feelings is a hate crime.
[01:46:53.506 --> 01:46:54.327]  This is nuts!
[01:46:55.448 --> 01:46:59.933]  And we've said from day one, post these in public commons where other posters are posted.
[01:47:00.994 --> 01:47:05.218]  Do not post it on, you know, post offices or government things.
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:10.062]  I mean, there's a pole out front of a government building.
[01:47:10.082 --> 01:47:10.583]  Yeah, that's good.
[01:47:10.603 --> 01:47:12.084]  People put stuff on those all the time.
[01:47:12.645 --> 01:47:16.008]  You know, they're telling us everywhere we can't go out and speech and have demonstrations.
[01:47:16.068 --> 01:47:18.190]  We have to stand up for our free speech.
[01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:20.352]  But, you know, now I'm some evil hate criminal.
[01:47:20.372 --> 01:47:20.892]  That's coming up.
[01:47:21.693 --> 01:47:26.938]  Yes, to answer the caller's question, they are hiring criminals for the military.
[01:47:28.188 --> 01:47:29.450]  They are hiring felons.
[01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:30.712]  They are hiring illegal aliens.
[01:47:30.752 --> 01:47:32.594]  And even police agencies are now.
[01:47:33.035 --> 01:47:34.136]  And that's mainstream news.
[01:47:34.156 --> 01:47:35.158]  You can just search engine.
[01:47:35.438 --> 01:47:37.141]  Startpage.com is a good search engine.
[01:47:37.481 --> 01:47:39.945]  You can just search that out and see that for yourself.
[01:47:39.985 --> 01:47:41.407]  Steve Quayle comments on that front.
[01:47:43.374 --> 01:47:54.683]  We're going to see the enlisting of all sorts of, quote-unquote, what society would call undesirables, not my term, theirs, to enlist in this war against us.
[01:47:54.723 --> 01:48:04.111]  Listen, Alex, when the Chinese were bringing in weapons almost ten years ago to the different gangs, the different groups, and the entire West Coast, we were reporting on that.
[01:48:04.431 --> 01:48:06.873]  There were stories in the, excuse me,
[01:48:07.293 --> 01:48:11.734]  Mainstream press about it, and people say, well I hope that doesn't mean what I think it means.
[01:48:12.034 --> 01:48:13.374]  It means exactly what it is.
[01:48:13.434 --> 01:48:33.259]  Listen, I've interviewed gang members, I've interviewed revolutionaries over the years, being on talk radio, and they all say, we know what's coming, and they don't plan on giving up their guns, so the point is that it's going to be total chaos, and this is absolutely necessity under the Communist Manifesto, but more so under the New World Orders doctrine.
[01:48:33.559 --> 01:48:33.839]  Absolutely.
[01:48:33.919 --> 01:48:41.385]  You know, I just can't believe that the public thinks it's illegal to put a poster up on a light pole where everybody else puts posters up.
[01:48:41.405 --> 01:48:44.367]  I mean, they don't freak out when it's a lost dog or a pro-Obama poster.
[01:48:44.407 --> 01:48:45.208]  Look, I have the President
[01:49:02.688 --> 01:49:24.374]  saying put these on put his on stop signs now I told people don't put them on stop signs but see it's okay for Obama on his letterhead show people this is this made national news it's okay he says put it on put it on state and property I'm saying don't do that but he's okay but then you put it on
[01:49:26.891 --> 01:49:30.913]  You know, some type of thing downtown where other posters are, you're supposedly evil.
[01:49:30.933 --> 01:49:31.893]  These people are sick.
[01:49:32.314 --> 01:49:34.435]  But just like you said, Steve, it's two different rules.
[01:49:34.455 --> 01:49:35.595]  They have two different systems.
[01:49:36.736 --> 01:49:39.517]  It's them versus us, and that's what's obvious.
[01:49:39.918 --> 01:49:41.559]  And now, let me tell you something.
[01:49:41.979 --> 01:49:43.940]  More protests are going to feel more threatened.
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:49.863]  More threats are going to feel more laws, or they're going to feel more laws against America being able to express
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:51.840]  Well, that's why I did this.
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:55.321]  A week and a half ago, I saw them demonizing whoever put a few of these up in L.A.
[01:49:55.361 --> 01:49:57.542]  and the media was saying, should they be allowed?
[01:49:57.622 --> 01:49:58.402]  Is it okay?
[01:49:58.442 --> 01:49:59.122]  Is it racist?
[01:49:59.602 --> 01:50:02.943]  And I went, they made Bush the Joker, and I supported that.
[01:50:02.983 --> 01:50:05.023]  We even posted it on our website.
[01:50:05.063 --> 01:50:09.144]  I said, so I said, everybody, I'm gonna make t-shirts, which we now have available for sale.
[01:50:09.545 --> 01:50:10.905]  Next, they'll say you can't wear this.
[01:50:10.925 --> 01:50:14.846]  And we got them in black and white and different messages on them at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:15.626 --> 01:50:17.747]  Steve Quayle, do one more minute with us on the other side.
[01:50:17.767 --> 01:50:20.988]  I want to plug your website, your books, your materials, all very informative.
[01:50:21.008 --> 01:50:26.590]  I know you're so concerned about what's happening, you're not even plugging them these days, but people still need to get them and read them.
[01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:32.032]  SteveQuayle.com, my website's InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:32.332 --> 01:50:35.514]  The Joker contest has gone ultra-mega-viral.
[01:50:38.375 --> 01:50:42.076]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:50:42.116 --> 01:50:43.917]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:50:46.613 --> 01:50:47.714]  This is Alex Jones.

[01:50:49.997 --> 01:50:50.638]  Well, you should.
[01:50:50.978 --> 01:50:55.223]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.

[01:51:13.621 --> 01:51:20.145]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:51:20.525 --> 01:51:25.729]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[01:51:49.847 --> 01:51:51.789]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:55.032]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:25.081 --> 01:52:28.682]  All right, we are into the fourth and final hour today.
[01:52:28.702 --> 01:52:32.723]  Steve Quayle joined us to break down the whole flu situation.
[01:52:32.823 --> 01:52:37.965]  I see that as the only card they've got to really be able to say the general public's the enemy.
[01:52:38.325 --> 01:52:40.165]  Their pretext of fear and hysteria.
[01:52:40.565 --> 01:52:41.826]  That's the best card they've got.
[01:52:41.846 --> 01:52:43.206]  They've got some other cards they can play.
[01:52:47.267 --> 01:52:54.990]  We now see the Southern Poverty Law Center and others coming out pre-hyping that, so that really increases the danger of that.
[01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:58.090]  But does virus increase the risk of cancer?
[01:52:58.151 --> 01:52:59.191]  Live cancer viruses.
[01:52:59.211 --> 01:53:00.131]  We'll go over more of this.
[01:53:00.531 --> 01:53:01.652]  We've got Darryl Rundis coming up.
[01:53:01.732 --> 01:53:02.412]  A ton of other
[01:53:03.252 --> 01:53:05.974]  News, as things accelerate and just get crazier and crazier.
[01:53:06.435 --> 01:53:13.740]  I want to commend all the video entries of folks out at public places where other posters are being posted, other handbills are being posted.
[01:53:14.221 --> 01:53:18.144]  Be sure you follow the rules to do that, but I can only say great job to everybody.
[01:53:18.504 --> 01:53:20.466]  This is a great exercise in the First Amendment.
[01:53:20.826 --> 01:53:25.810]  Steve, in closing, why do you think this Joker image scares them so much?
[01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:30.013]  A. B. Tell us about some of the great books and things you've written.
[01:53:31.889 --> 01:53:32.410]  We're good.
[01:53:50.991 --> 01:53:51.872]  We're good to go.
[01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:14.524]  And I think, Alex, the thing that people need to understand is that we are running out of time.
[01:54:14.544 --> 01:54:24.771]  In my perspective, they had better recognize that there comes a day when the powers that be shut the internet off, shut down the communications, shut down the power, shut down everything.
[01:54:25.191 --> 01:54:32.593]  And then they're only going to be left to what they know and what they've been trained by before, or the knowledge that you and I and others have given them.
[01:54:32.633 --> 01:54:40.056]  Those people needing survival skills, you need to go to survivalblog.com, the best website of its kind in the world.
[01:54:40.436 --> 01:54:45.398]  Those who need a preparedness manual to get caught up to speed, Holly Dale, dare to prepare.
[01:54:45.438 --> 01:54:46.338]  By the way, she's sending
[01:54:46.758 --> 01:54:47.259]  We're good to go.
[01:55:06.776 --> 01:55:09.217]  Our days of speaking are very limited.
[01:55:09.577 --> 01:55:12.178]  It's not because of what we would or not do.
[01:55:12.198 --> 01:55:14.439]  It's what they intend to do and shut us down.
[01:55:14.779 --> 01:55:18.621]  And the full court presses on, and people had better get close to the Living God.
[01:55:18.641 --> 01:55:19.501]  They'd better repent.
[01:55:19.821 --> 01:55:23.583]  They'd better understand that the one who laid all these events out for us
[01:55:24.023 --> 01:55:25.844]  In the beginning was Jesus.
[01:55:25.884 --> 01:55:27.964]  He said it's going to happen, and it's going to happen.
[01:55:28.004 --> 01:55:30.025]  The question is, can we stop it?
[01:55:30.225 --> 01:55:39.608]  Every day we have another day of giving more information, of preparing another individual, or another group, or another country around the world.
[01:55:39.648 --> 01:55:40.908]  We go worldwide, as you know.
[01:55:41.709 --> 01:55:43.049]  That's what I thank God for.
[01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:48.551]  Moments of mercy, because very soon, the moments of mercy will give way to the moments of madness.
[01:55:48.971 --> 01:55:50.332]  Well, I hope that's not the case.
[01:55:50.352 --> 01:55:51.373]  We're working to stop that.
[01:55:51.413 --> 01:55:55.956]  But why do you think this Joker poster in the last minute has concerned the elitists so much?
[01:55:56.356 --> 01:56:00.019]  Because the Joker poster is emblematic of evil.
[01:56:00.179 --> 01:56:12.888]  In the Heath Ledger portrayal of the Joker in the last Batman, Harold is probably one of the most brilliant portrayals by an actor of sinister evil coupled with sort of a funny face.
[01:56:13.388 --> 01:56:15.169]  That's what's getting to the elite.
[01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:16.030]  The elite know.
[01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:18.451]  They've used every form of symbol.
[01:56:18.812 --> 01:56:27.077]  They've used every form of subconscious portrayal in all their media, what I call, vomit presentations.
[01:56:27.177 --> 01:56:30.219]  And now, it's because it's being turned back on them, Alex.
[01:56:31.059 --> 01:56:33.361]  They don't like it when they get a taste of their own medicine.
[01:56:33.381 --> 01:56:33.981]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:56:34.001 --> 01:56:34.362]  Bye-bye.
[01:56:49.873 --> 01:56:50.353]  God bless.

[01:56:52.974 --> 01:56:54.214]  PrisonPlanet dot TV.
[01:56:54.494 --> 01:56:55.795]  They'll run straight ahead.
[01:56:55.815 --> 01:56:56.315]  Stay with us.
[01:56:56.955 --> 01:57:01.957]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:57:02.177 --> 01:57:05.878]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:06.198 --> 01:57:06.438]  Number 2.
[01:57:06.878 --> 01:57:11.801]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:57:12.101 --> 01:57:12.541]  It's true.
[01:57:12.741 --> 01:57:16.963]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:57:17.163 --> 01:57:17.683]  Number 3.
[01:57:18.084 --> 01:57:23.526]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:57:23.706 --> 01:57:23.926]  Number 4.
[01:57:24.367 --> 01:57:27.028]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:57:27.268 --> 01:57:30.690]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:57:30.930 --> 01:57:31.150]  Number 5.
[01:57:31.790 --> 01:57:35.412]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:57:35.632 --> 01:57:41.137]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:57:41.378 --> 01:57:45.922]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:57:46.062 --> 01:57:47.624]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:57:57.247 --> 01:57:59.850]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:00.251 --> 01:58:05.218]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:07.320]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:58:07.641 --> 01:58:12.227]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:58:12.247 --> 01:58:12.867]  We're good to go.
[01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:36.601]  How much will you need?
[01:58:36.842 --> 01:58:37.462]  We don't know.
[01:58:37.743 --> 01:58:38.664]  How much do you want?
[01:58:38.864 --> 01:58:39.605]  All you can get.
[01:58:39.785 --> 01:58:40.626]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:40.886 --> 01:58:43.649]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:58:43.930 --> 01:58:45.692]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:58:45.712 --> 01:58:46.633]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:58:56.715 --> 01:59:05.704]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:59:05.864 --> 01:59:13.913]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[01:59:14.033 --> 01:59:15.895]  In fact, clinically detected parasites
[01:59:16.015 --> 01:59:16.375]  I think so.
[01:59:43.306 --> 01:59:47.127]  Excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[01:59:47.267 --> 01:59:50.067]  Order some today at FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[01:59:50.187 --> 01:59:52.388]  Again, that's FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[01:59:52.548 --> 01:59:53.648]  Or call 888-949-3570.
[01:59:54.088 --> 02:00:04.450]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:00:05.050 --> 02:00:08.011]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.396 --> 02:00:16.277]  We have found it!
[02:00:16.917 --> 02:00:17.778]  We have found it!
[02:00:18.258 --> 02:00:22.522]  And it's going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com by the end of the show.
[02:00:22.802 --> 02:00:31.429]  The Washington Post with Obama telling his people to take the images of him with hope and change and put it on stop signs in government buildings.
[02:00:32.670 --> 02:00:34.311]  Now, we're not saying that.
[02:00:34.371 --> 02:00:36.853]  We're saying put it where it's legal and lawful in your area.
[02:00:38.174 --> 02:00:39.776]  You know, where people put posters up.
[02:00:39.856 --> 02:00:41.017]  Which is all over downtown.
[02:00:41.057 --> 02:00:42.438]  You see posters, put it up there.
[02:00:42.998 --> 02:00:44.419]  So they can't say you've done something wrong.
[02:00:45.427 --> 02:00:53.593]  They're on the news saying you can't put it on a power pole and that we're criminals, hate criminals, that it's racial.
[02:00:54.414 --> 02:00:55.975]  But the Cato Institute's defending us.
[02:00:56.055 --> 02:00:58.497]  Sorry, not every criticism of Obama is racist.
[02:00:59.618 --> 02:01:00.358]  And they go over it.
[02:01:00.899 --> 02:01:05.382]  But, man, they are really coming after us and they are scared of this.
[02:01:05.422 --> 02:01:08.645]  So put more of the posters up, but don't put them up on private property.
[02:01:10.230 --> 02:01:17.412]  Put them up where you, you know, like in downtown areas or bulletin boards or like, you know, you always see the abandoned buildings that have just all over them.
[02:01:17.712 --> 02:01:20.353]  People are doing that there, but I guess they may selectively enforce.
[02:01:20.613 --> 02:01:26.734]  There could be ads for furniture and ads for lost dogs and ads for the local hamburger place.
[02:01:27.255 --> 02:01:33.276]  I guess we just give in and say, okay, we're going to let you selectively tell us we can't put the posters up.
[02:01:33.316 --> 02:01:37.357]  But Obama can be in the Washington Post and tell everybody to put his up.
[02:01:37.477 --> 02:01:39.198]  Now, YouTube's censoring us.
[02:01:40.413 --> 02:01:53.301]  YouTube took down two of my videos, not me joking around like the Joker to promote this contest, that's why I did that, but serious ones where I said, it isn't about Obama, it isn't about Bush, they're puppets, let's come together against the New World Order.
[02:01:53.321 --> 02:01:56.824]  Obama's really a fascist, but he's just a front.
[02:01:57.644 --> 02:02:02.567]  The posters aren't racist, they're removing those, because they don't want us to come together.
[02:02:03.308 --> 02:02:07.691]  And I remember a few months ago talking to Daryl Rundas, who's done a lot of big successful things in the past,
[02:02:08.678 --> 02:02:13.439]  I said, well he said, I'm going to start something for the people's own YouTube.
[02:02:14.359 --> 02:02:21.401]  And, you know, there's a lot of other video sites out there, but this is going to be one where YouDoNews.com couldn't beat the URL.
[02:02:21.441 --> 02:02:22.401]  He said it was just available.
[02:02:22.441 --> 02:02:23.641]  Wow, that's Providence.
[02:02:24.262 --> 02:02:28.943]  Just you, the letter U, DoNews.com, and there it is.
[02:02:28.963 --> 02:02:30.423]  It says, coming soon, Daryl.
[02:02:30.483 --> 02:02:34.304]  I would imagine we need to have you up for a main interview when it's ready to go.
[02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:41.030]  Well, we should be ready to release it, or should I say unleash it, on the public Monday.
[02:02:41.050 --> 02:02:44.415]  So hopefully we can get down to Austin.
[02:02:44.455 --> 02:02:46.779]  Forgive me for not getting in the studio today.
[02:02:47.619 --> 02:02:49.640]  Well, that's fine, but we want to have you when you officially launch it.
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:52.461]  So, in the next few weeks, once it's up and going, we'll get it up.
[02:02:53.001 --> 02:02:54.301]  But tell us about UDO News.
[02:02:54.341 --> 02:03:00.904]  Well, first off, what do you think about Obama's in the Washington Post saying, put my image up on stop signs.
[02:03:00.924 --> 02:03:02.984]  That's a quote, and I have his official White House letter.
[02:03:03.284 --> 02:03:06.726]  But then, my listeners aren't allowed to put them on power poles.
[02:03:07.366 --> 02:03:13.348]  Well, that, among many, many other selective prosecution or selective
[02:03:14.457 --> 02:03:16.058]  Constitutional enforcement.
[02:03:16.118 --> 02:03:17.920]  You know, it's good for them, but it's not good for us.
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:26.868]  In fact, the one question I'd be asking all these politicians at these town halls is, if this health care is so good, why aren't you doing it?
[02:03:27.248 --> 02:03:29.490]  You know, if it's good for you, then I'll do it too.
[02:03:29.530 --> 02:03:30.651]  So I'll do it if you do it.
[02:03:31.011 --> 02:03:33.253]  Everybody believes in the golden rule, right?
[02:03:33.353 --> 02:03:35.015]  Do unto others as you have them do to you.
[02:03:35.095 --> 02:03:37.677]  Even people who don't believe in God believe in the golden rule.
[02:03:37.697 --> 02:03:39.498]  So if it's good for us, it should be good for them.
[02:03:39.899 --> 02:03:40.760]  Let them go first.
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:41.300]  What do you think?
[02:03:43.066 --> 02:03:43.807]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:03:43.847 --> 02:03:48.911]  I want to get into some more of those issues, but, Darryl, tell us about what YouDoNews.com is going to look like.
[02:03:49.892 --> 02:03:50.933]  What's going to be happening?
[02:03:50.973 --> 02:03:52.114]  What it's going to look like.
[02:03:52.174 --> 02:03:53.295]  Let me tell you what it's going to be.
[02:03:54.062 --> 02:03:57.185]  See, I don't want this to just be some new, cool website.
[02:03:57.265 --> 02:03:58.606]  Sure, it's going to be like YouTube.
[02:03:58.626 --> 02:03:59.567]  You can upload videos.
[02:03:59.867 --> 02:04:01.228]  You can also upload audio.
[02:04:01.469 --> 02:04:06.353]  So you can record conversations with your politicians or your tax collector when they're railroading you.
[02:04:06.373 --> 02:04:12.758]  And you can post them into your own blog on our website, import the audio, and do a story that wraps around that audio.
[02:04:12.798 --> 02:04:18.143]  So we're going to have a lot of different media available to people, you know, for the news they do.
[02:04:18.203 --> 02:04:18.884]  But let me tell you,
[02:04:19.304 --> 02:04:22.347]  What's really my hope and my prayer for this thing, okay?
[02:04:22.367 --> 02:04:24.069]  Because I'm not in this for the money, you know that.
[02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:30.275]  What makes this different than YouTube is the fact that we're going to pay you for the news you do.
[02:04:30.736 --> 02:04:41.146]  So you can continue to just let your news get tossed down the tube, or you can go to YouDoNews, post your information, post your story, and we're going to pay you for the news you do.
[02:04:42.912 --> 02:04:44.092]  Well, that's a great idea.
[02:04:44.112 --> 02:04:46.413]  And we do need more alternatives.
[02:04:46.433 --> 02:04:47.474]  I think it's a great name.
[02:04:47.494 --> 02:04:48.834]  It's going to have a lot of different functions.
[02:04:48.854 --> 02:04:50.275]  I know you've got some great IT people.
[02:04:50.595 --> 02:04:52.736]  So we should see this launch next Monday.
[02:04:52.756 --> 02:04:56.177]  I can go to YouDoNews.com and start uploading videos?
[02:04:56.357 --> 02:04:56.818]  Absolutely.
[02:04:56.858 --> 02:04:58.898]  In fact, let me just give you an example, Alex.
[02:04:59.159 --> 02:05:01.480]  I googled your name on YouTube, okay?
[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:06.622]  You've got a video here that you, I guess, produced 2.7 million views.
[02:05:06.882 --> 02:05:07.682]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:05:08.142 --> 02:05:09.963]  How much money did YouTube pay you?
[02:05:11.585 --> 02:05:12.826]  Uh, they paid me zero.
[02:05:12.866 --> 02:05:14.768]  They selectively will do it with some people.
[02:05:14.808 --> 02:05:16.090]  We asked and they said no.
[02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:18.272]  We don't want to be an affiliate with you.
[02:05:19.113 --> 02:05:28.423]  And I've been told that, I've got videos with over 3 million, 4 million, 5 million views actually on there, that a regular person who they do do a deal with would probably be paid about $50,000 for that.
[02:05:28.463 --> 02:05:28.903]  That's right.
[02:05:31.085 --> 02:05:38.668]  You know, we want this to be more than what... No, no, YouTube makes money off me, but then still erases what they don't like.
[02:05:38.808 --> 02:05:42.330]  I mean, they're doing me a favor, but they actually want us there.
[02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:46.171]  No, they're making money off the masses, so you listen close, America.
[02:05:46.391 --> 02:05:46.731]  Okay?
[02:05:46.751 --> 02:05:47.772]  Look, I've already made my money.
[02:05:48.332 --> 02:05:55.073]  I'm doing this to create a community, an internet community that's certainly of, by, and for the people, okay?
[02:05:55.093 --> 02:05:56.674]  This is your website.
[02:05:56.714 --> 02:06:05.116]  This is going to be a community of independent news journalists who get up, get out, they grab their camera, they grab their cell phone, their recorders, and they start doing news.
[02:06:05.236 --> 02:06:16.558]  Because as Judge Napolitano said at the Tea Party in Ohio, there is nothing, nothing the government hates more than for us to expose the deeds they do in darkness.
[02:06:17.242 --> 02:06:17.842]  With light.
[02:06:17.902 --> 02:06:18.903]  The light of the camera.
[02:06:18.943 --> 02:06:21.763]  He said the camera is the new gun.
[02:06:22.144 --> 02:06:23.044]  And I agree with him.
[02:06:23.144 --> 02:06:26.485]  I think that's what my passion now is why I'm doing this whole thing.
[02:06:26.825 --> 02:06:28.045]  And once again, it's not about me.
[02:06:28.085 --> 02:06:29.766]  This is all about the news you do.
[02:06:30.626 --> 02:06:31.566]  So here's how it's going to work.
[02:06:31.646 --> 02:06:34.667]  Let me just spell it out for America so they really get this, Alex.
[02:06:35.568 --> 02:06:43.350]  We, every single quarter, when we get out of beta testing, which should be about January, every quarter we're going to pay out 20% of our ad revenue.
[02:06:43.900 --> 02:06:48.303]  And we're going to distribute that ad revenue, that 20%, to everybody.
[02:06:48.523 --> 02:06:50.665]  I don't care how long you've been a reporter with U2 News.
[02:06:51.025 --> 02:06:53.047]  I don't care what content you produce.
[02:06:53.127 --> 02:06:57.150]  As long as it's your content, it's original content, you produce that news.
[02:06:57.210 --> 02:07:01.513]  You can take news clips from Fox, do commentary on it, news review is what we call that.
[02:07:01.953 --> 02:07:07.317]  Whatever it is, it's got to be creative, it's got to be original, it's got to be factual, it's got to be good, hard-hitting news.
[02:07:08.934 --> 02:07:16.757]  At the end of that quarter, if you got, let's say Alex, 10% of the total views on our website, you'd get 10% of that ad revenue.
[02:07:19.438 --> 02:07:22.039]  Now that's exciting, and it'll take a lot of bandwidth.
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:25.601]  We thought about doing it just like ourselves, I just don't have the funds.
[02:07:27.136 --> 02:07:30.358]  Or the energy to try to raise the money to do something like that.
[02:07:30.378 --> 02:07:40.005]  So I'm glad you've got it, Daryl, because for those that don't know, for us, when we have a video that gets like 30-40,000 views, we've had Google erase our flu emergency report.
[02:07:40.405 --> 02:07:47.450]  We posted it, and I forget, it was like 40-50,000 views in a couple days, and that was a couple thousand dollars for me to have to pay.
[02:07:47.470 --> 02:07:52.673]  And we've got pretty good pricing on bulk bandwidth.
[02:07:52.693 --> 02:07:55.916]  We're using, what is it, 100 terabytes a month now or something?
[02:07:56.872 --> 02:07:58.073]  In between everything or more?
[02:07:59.294 --> 02:07:59.534]  Yeah.
[02:07:59.554 --> 02:08:00.475]  75 terabytes.
[02:08:00.515 --> 02:08:01.056]  We've got 100.
[02:08:01.116 --> 02:08:03.478]  So as we go up to 100, then that was the number I was told.
[02:08:03.498 --> 02:08:05.560]  Well, believe me, Alex, I have counted the cost.
[02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:18.992]  And I'm willing to roll at minimum a million of my own dollars into this, OK, before I ever even think about breaking even, in order to create the platform for the people to share the news that everyone in the world needs to know.
[02:08:19.232 --> 02:08:19.893]  Well that's good Daryl.
[02:08:19.973 --> 02:08:21.414]  I should talk to you behind the scenes.
[02:08:21.434 --> 02:08:23.496]  I want to make sure you're getting the best price on bandwidth.
[02:08:23.596 --> 02:08:25.678]  I mean, are you using big CDNs?
[02:08:26.058 --> 02:08:27.720]  Yeah, that's the only delay.
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:29.181]  We'd be rolling hot right now.
[02:08:29.221 --> 02:08:30.282]  We'd be going live right now.
[02:08:30.322 --> 02:08:40.711]  But I want to make sure all the CDNs are in place so that if they hack us or if we get an abundance of views all at one time, that there's what's called load balancing among those CDNs as well.
[02:08:40.771 --> 02:08:45.676]  So that way it's fast and good or bigger and better than YouTube.
[02:08:46.356 --> 02:08:53.000]  Once again, look, you can keep uploading all your videos to YouTube and let the big corporate Googles of the world make money off of it.
[02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:53.240]  No, no, no.
[02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:53.580]  Exactly.
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:09:00.084]  You go on YouTube and you promote things like YouDoNews.com and other things, and so what we do is we never quit YouTube.
[02:09:00.724 --> 02:09:03.846]  We battle there, but we battle on other fronts as well.
[02:09:04.226 --> 02:09:08.548]  Well, what I'm saying is don't buy the lie the corporate media has told us that, oh, we've got to go viral.
[02:09:08.588 --> 02:09:09.169]  Think about this.
[02:09:09.629 --> 02:09:14.291]  You've produced one of the greatest documentaries, in my opinion, in the Obama deception.
[02:09:14.652 --> 02:09:14.852]  All right?
[02:09:16.181 --> 02:09:20.446]  Hundreds of thousands, millions of people have watched that and they got to watch it for free.
[02:09:20.927 --> 02:09:30.618]  That's wonderful and that's great and we all love your heart and we love your commitment and we love the thought that you just want to get the information out into the hands of the people because you know the truth sets people free.
[02:09:31.218 --> 02:09:39.061]  But at the same time, I believe every laborer is worth their hire, and that you should be paid and compensated for the work that you do.
[02:09:39.201 --> 02:09:51.965]  So, once again, you can continue to put them on YouTube all you want, that's good, but once our ad revenue starts to go up, people may want to think twice about putting them anywhere but You Do News, because at least you're getting paid for every time someone
[02:09:52.385 --> 02:09:54.586]  No, no, I think it's great and then that funds your operation.
[02:09:54.626 --> 02:09:56.307]  I'm just able to fund it with DVD sales.
[02:09:56.847 --> 02:10:03.790]  Unfortunately, as the free quality gets better and better on the web, we see the DVD sales go down, but we've got other ways of raising money.
[02:10:04.230 --> 02:10:13.094]  And I do see it in the future, a couple years from now, where we may not be able to operate because one DVD gets sold and it's free everywhere in that same quality.
[02:10:13.514 --> 02:10:14.855]  I'm kind of destroying myself.
[02:10:15.515 --> 02:10:17.176]  But we don't have any future anyways if I don't.
[02:10:17.196 --> 02:10:20.619]  But no, that's what's great about You Do News and the rest of them.
[02:10:20.639 --> 02:10:27.463]  That's why we sell t-shirts and sell the DVDs and hope people will buy them so they have them in the higher quality at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:28.404 --> 02:10:30.085]  You're going to get the best of all worlds.
[02:10:30.105 --> 02:10:34.488]  You can continue to do what you've been doing, but you can also be getting that residual check.
[02:10:34.508 --> 02:10:42.594]  Just think, years from now when the Obama deception is still getting used, those are counted towards your clicks, towards the total percentage that you get paid for the news you do.
[02:10:43.594 --> 02:10:45.074]  You'll get the best of all worlds.
[02:10:45.214 --> 02:10:46.595]  Once again, my heart is in this.
[02:10:47.095 --> 02:10:47.935]  Not for the money.
[02:10:48.375 --> 02:10:49.855]  The love of money is the root of all evil.
[02:10:49.875 --> 02:10:52.396]  No, I love people and I care about my country.
[02:10:52.456 --> 02:10:55.036]  Yeah, but Darrell, I know because you've been a big contributor actually to this office.
[02:10:55.056 --> 02:10:56.097]  People don't even know about that.
[02:10:56.177 --> 02:10:58.237]  And you've owned quite a few big successful companies.
[02:10:58.517 --> 02:10:59.397]  And I'm glad you're doing this.
[02:10:59.417 --> 02:11:00.798]  You don't have to explain that.
[02:11:00.818 --> 02:11:03.838]  But it is true to get people paid will actually generate more.
[02:11:03.858 --> 02:11:05.359]  And we need to fund ourselves.
[02:11:05.599 --> 02:11:07.419]  The globalists take our money and taxes.
[02:11:08.039 --> 02:11:08.239]  Yes.
[02:11:26.651 --> 02:11:28.713]  50, 60, 100 million dollar companies a year.
[02:11:29.273 --> 02:11:31.094]  I forget, some of your companies are bigger than that.
[02:11:31.114 --> 02:11:34.217]  I know you've been arrested for preaching the gospel in Dallas.
[02:11:34.257 --> 02:11:35.157]  I've seen that in the news.
[02:11:35.798 --> 02:11:36.919]  I'm so aware of your great work.
[02:11:36.939 --> 02:11:39.300]  We're going to come back and talk more about this.
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:41.582]  YouDoNews.com.
[02:11:42.062 --> 02:11:44.324]  We're just here supporting alternative media and other venues.
[02:11:44.664 --> 02:11:47.046]  Coming up, we've got the gentleman who wore the gun on his side.
[02:11:47.606 --> 02:11:48.727]  Chris Matthews flipped out.
[02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:51.028]  That's coming up in the last 30 minutes of the show as well.
[02:11:51.549 --> 02:11:52.730]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:55.712]  PrisonPlanet.tv is our subscription video site.
[02:11:56.971 --> 02:12:01.294]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[02:12:01.494 --> 02:12:03.915]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[02:12:04.055 --> 02:12:13.541]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[02:12:13.541 --> 02:12:13.961]  We're good to go.
[02:12:32.692 --> 02:12:33.232]  I think so.

[02:13:58.673 --> 02:14:00.774]  A New World Order.
[02:14:01.494 --> 02:14:05.915]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:14:05.975 --> 02:14:09.176]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:14:09.216 --> 02:14:11.377]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:14:11.997 --> 02:14:14.437]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:14:15.178 --> 02:14:22.500]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:14:25.526 --> 02:14:30.509]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:14:34.832 --> 02:14:37.314]  Bill Burr is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:14:37.414 --> 02:14:38.555]  Most people have no idea.
[02:14:38.575 --> 02:14:39.335]  They're not after money.
[02:14:39.355 --> 02:14:40.436]  They have all the money they need.
[02:14:40.636 --> 02:14:41.357]  They're after power.
[02:14:41.617 --> 02:14:42.637]  That's what they're after these days.
[02:14:42.778 --> 02:14:47.301]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:14:51.263 --> 02:14:51.864]  In Game.
[02:14:52.264 --> 02:14:53.765]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[02:14:54.285 --> 02:14:55.346]  You have been warned.
[02:14:56.928 --> 02:14:59.531]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:14:59.952 --> 02:15:04.919]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:15:05.279 --> 02:15:07.041]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:15:07.342 --> 02:15:11.988]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:15:11.988 --> 02:15:12.408]  I don't know.
[02:15:30.094 --> 02:15:30.574]  We're good to go!
[02:16:06.796 --> 02:16:24.142]  We've got a news report that Michael Jordan on 9-11 will be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame and that's going to be part of Obama's 9-11 memorial.
[02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:37.630]  Notice why America's dumbed down and falling apart.
[02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:42.132]  Our heroes are not inventors, they're not scientists, they're not firemen that save kids in burning buildings.
[02:16:42.692 --> 02:16:44.413]  It's people that play basketball and football.
[02:16:44.433 --> 02:16:46.814]  And I'm not saying you can't like those guys, and that's great.
[02:16:47.175 --> 02:16:53.638]  But the establishment has written in documents that they make your heroes sports icons so you don't have heroes that really matter.
[02:16:54.218 --> 02:16:57.319]  And then kids stop wanting to be an inventor or a scientist or a doctor.
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:01.201]  They want to be a basketball player, and there's only a few slots for that.
[02:17:02.082 --> 02:17:03.943]  And it's this lottery economy.
[02:17:03.983 --> 02:17:04.423]  You see them
[02:17:05.538 --> 02:17:17.129]  On CNN they have this thing where for 30 seconds you beg for a job, and then only certain people can get the slot, and it's all about, you know, you got hope and change, and you're rolling the dice.
[02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:19.791]  George Orwell talks about that in 1984.
[02:17:20.251 --> 02:17:21.573]  Very, very sick society.
[02:17:22.597 --> 02:17:24.458]  No, we need to take action ourselves.
[02:17:25.278 --> 02:17:28.180]  So many people talk about the government and the corruption, but they don't get involved.
[02:17:28.580 --> 02:17:30.041]  Start with videos.
[02:17:30.461 --> 02:17:31.542]  Start with websites.
[02:17:31.622 --> 02:17:33.123]  Start with audio blogs.
[02:17:33.743 --> 02:17:37.125]  So, Daryl Rundis, I can't wait until YouDoNews.com gets launched.
[02:17:37.385 --> 02:17:39.426]  What are some of your other websites you can plug today?
[02:17:39.546 --> 02:17:46.670]  Hey, don't forget, I am still giving $20,000 away for anybody who can name the tank mammoth in 20 seconds or less.
[02:17:46.730 --> 02:17:48.751]  So, we give that away in October.
[02:17:49.338 --> 02:17:52.321]  I'm giving everyone an incentive to get back to the basics.
[02:18:11.892 --> 02:18:13.193]  So how does somebody win then?
[02:18:13.233 --> 02:18:17.035]  I mean, if it's easy, then how do you pick the one person?
[02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:22.678]  Well, we put a video up there to train you in two minutes how to learn how to list the law and order in 20 seconds or less.
[02:18:22.738 --> 02:18:25.719]  And then in October, I forget the day, you'll have to go to the website and check.
[02:18:26.060 --> 02:18:29.641]  I'm going to get on the phone, start drawing names of those who registered one by one.
[02:18:30.082 --> 02:18:33.343]  First one I get on the phone, second do it, get 20 grand.
[02:18:33.403 --> 02:18:33.864]  That simple.
[02:18:34.424 --> 02:18:35.064]  Oh, that's great.
[02:18:35.464 --> 02:18:37.145]  That is certainly a good thing you're doing.
[02:18:37.185 --> 02:18:38.126]  I know you're good for it.
[02:18:38.146 --> 02:18:39.867]  You've certainly helped what we're doing here.
[02:18:40.652 --> 02:18:48.496]  Hey, I just wondered, before we part ways, Alex, I just once again want to let everybody know, I thank God for you, and I know I speak for many others out there.
[02:18:48.516 --> 02:18:49.737]  It's not easy doing what you're doing.
[02:18:49.757 --> 02:18:51.278]  You're constantly being attacked.
[02:18:51.718 --> 02:18:54.739]  But remember, man, you catch most of the flack when you're over the target.
[02:18:54.799 --> 02:18:56.480]  So you just keep pushing that plow.
[02:18:56.780 --> 02:18:57.961]  You don't even think of looking back.
[02:18:59.281 --> 02:19:02.964]  Well, that is certainly the fact, Darrell, and as soon as you launch the site we'll have you back up.
[02:19:02.984 --> 02:19:08.408]  You don't have to come down to Austin from Dallas to be in studio, but if you want to, that'd be great, and I can't wait.
[02:19:08.908 --> 02:19:09.889]  I'm glad you're doing this.
[02:19:10.349 --> 02:19:12.471]  To get the word out, YouDoNews.com.
[02:19:12.551 --> 02:19:19.176]  You, with just a you, YouDoNews.com, up on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:19:19.416 --> 02:19:21.037]  Hey, and one last thought.
[02:19:21.077 --> 02:19:25.721]  Remind people, you guys listening, that as an independent news journalist with YouDoNews,
[02:19:26.161 --> 02:19:33.669]  That gives you access as the press to press passes to get you into these events like Obama is going to be speaking at with Michael Jordan.
[02:19:33.789 --> 02:19:36.331]  So, we'll be able to hook people up with those press passes.
[02:19:36.411 --> 02:19:45.220]  Sometimes you'll, depending on the event, have to pass a background check and get on the police report list, but if you're willing and you're qualified, then we can get you into those events.
[02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:45.841]  We can get you into
[02:19:47.443 --> 02:19:48.504]  Well, that's the exciting thing.
[02:19:48.524 --> 02:19:53.146]  People can do that with You Do News, or I tell them to start their own news site, have it sound official, and do it.
[02:19:53.606 --> 02:19:55.207]  People ask how we get big guests on.
[02:19:55.667 --> 02:19:56.748]  We call their publicist.
[02:19:58.629 --> 02:20:00.870]  And say, hey, we see they got a new book out.
[02:20:01.490 --> 02:20:03.972]  You know, can we have this astronaut or this person on?
[02:20:04.012 --> 02:20:04.792]  That's how we do it.
[02:20:05.272 --> 02:20:10.996]  People think I like to do some secret handshake to get a big guest on, but it's called the telephone.
[02:20:11.036 --> 02:20:13.077]  I mean, you pick it up.
[02:20:13.877 --> 02:20:16.219]  I think you're right, but remember desperate people do desperate things.
[02:20:16.239 --> 02:20:18.440]  So that just reveals, I think to you and everybody else,
[02:20:38.772 --> 02:20:40.253]  Who's in the know that they're desperate.
[02:20:40.453 --> 02:20:41.133]  They're desperate.
[02:20:41.193 --> 02:20:48.695]  Now, we definitely need to be on guard because, uh, you know, desperate people do do desperate things and we don't know how desperate are they really.
[02:20:48.735 --> 02:20:57.519]  But the fact that they're trying to discredit you and ruin you or me or anybody that's ever associated with you, then, uh, that's actually a good thing.
[02:20:57.759 --> 02:20:59.799]  So look, they did the same thing to Christ.
[02:21:00.860 --> 02:21:01.720]  So you're in good company.
[02:21:04.381 --> 02:21:04.942]  Absolutely.
[02:21:04.982 --> 02:21:08.464]  Darryl Rundis, we'll talk to you as soon as YouDoNews.com gets fully launched.
[02:21:08.504 --> 02:21:10.265]  Hey man, I'm going to leave you with one last scripture.
[02:21:10.285 --> 02:21:11.987]  Remember, James 417.
[02:21:12.507 --> 02:21:16.730]  Anyone who knows the good they ought to do and they don't do it, it's a sin.
[02:21:17.711 --> 02:21:21.594]  So get up, get out, get busy doing something to take our country back.
[02:21:22.334 --> 02:21:23.495]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:21:24.116 --> 02:21:25.196]  Darryl, good to hear from you.
[02:21:25.217 --> 02:21:25.937]  Take care, Alex.
[02:21:26.017 --> 02:21:26.457]  God bless.
[02:21:26.778 --> 02:21:27.098]  You bet.
[02:21:27.118 --> 02:21:27.638]  God bless you.
[02:21:27.678 --> 02:21:29.560]  When we come back, we're going to talk to the gentleman
[02:21:30.322 --> 02:21:40.532]  I got attacked by Chris Matthews, a thought criminal, wearing that gun yesterday down the street from an event that Lord Obama was going to be attending for death care.
[02:21:41.113 --> 02:21:43.836]  The death committees, which really do exist.
[02:21:44.416 --> 02:21:44.957]  We'll be right back.
[02:21:47.299 --> 02:21:48.200]  We're on the march.
[02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:50.282]  The empire's on the run.
[02:21:51.203 --> 02:21:53.906]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.684 --> 02:22:00.648]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:22:00.908 --> 02:22:02.690]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:22:02.930 --> 02:22:11.198]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:22:11.439 --> 02:22:16.684]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:22:17.004 --> 02:22:18.626]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:22:18.846 --> 02:22:25.167]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:22:25.367 --> 02:22:36.110]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:22:36.410 --> 02:22:36.910]  That's right.
[02:22:37.170 --> 02:22:39.490]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:22:39.730 --> 02:22:41.331]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:22:43.891 --> 02:23:01.714]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:23:01.854 --> 02:23:03.795]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:23:03.915 --> 02:23:06.195]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:23:06.375 --> 02:23:08.215]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:23:08.656 --> 02:23:09.976]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:23:10.256 --> 02:23:11.296]  There is a solution.
[02:23:11.536 --> 02:23:19.562]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:23:19.963 --> 02:23:27.028]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[02:23:33.473 --> 02:23:39.058]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[02:23:57.176 --> 02:24:01.440]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:06.605]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:24:06.805 --> 02:24:08.126]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:24:08.306 --> 02:24:11.790]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:17.094]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:25.882]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:24:25.943 --> 02:24:28.265]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[02:24:32.088 --> 02:24:33.029]  No animal testing.
[02:24:33.289 --> 02:24:34.410]  I use them and love them.
[02:24:34.611 --> 02:24:36.212]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[02:24:49.404 --> 02:24:55.990]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:24:59.453 --> 02:25:02.516]  Let's ask about the presidency and what he's trying to do with health care.
[02:25:02.776 --> 02:25:03.837]  You brought a loaded gun.
[02:25:03.857 --> 02:25:04.938]  Was your gun loaded today?
[02:25:04.958 --> 02:25:06.460]  Uh, wow.
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:08.702]  Who would be silly enough to carry an unloaded firearm?
[02:25:08.902 --> 02:25:09.682]  I'm only asking.
[02:25:09.702 --> 02:25:10.823]  You're answering the questions.
[02:25:11.464 --> 02:25:12.105]  Who's yelling now?
[02:25:12.125 --> 02:25:12.845]  Okay, that's for the tape.
[02:25:13.126 --> 02:25:15.348]  Why did you bring a loaded gun to a public meeting?
[02:25:15.928 --> 02:25:18.491]  Well, here in New Hampshire... I know the law.
[02:25:18.531 --> 02:25:19.833]  You can chew gum at church.
[02:25:19.853 --> 02:25:22.115]  You can ride in on a pogo stick.
[02:25:22.136 --> 02:25:23.898]  There's a lot of things you're legally allowed to do.
[02:25:24.218 --> 02:25:31.427]  Why did you bring a gun to a meeting with the President of the United States, given the violent history of this country with regard to presidents and assassinations?
[02:25:31.747 --> 02:25:34.711]  Why did you bring a gun to a public event with the President?
[02:25:35.996 --> 02:25:37.197]  You know the history of this country.
[02:25:37.217 --> 02:25:38.958]  If you love this country, you know it's history.
[02:25:38.978 --> 02:25:42.921]  You know we've had a problem with people with guns at presidential events.
[02:25:42.981 --> 02:25:45.402]  Why'd you bring a gun to an event with the president?
[02:25:45.943 --> 02:25:46.863]  I do know history.
[02:25:47.264 --> 02:25:55.869]  And the history is that our forefathers fought for the right to keep and bear armed and they believe that every person should be armed.
[02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:57.691]  Everybody knows that.
[02:25:57.711 --> 02:26:00.873]  Well, why did you bring a gun to a presidential event today?
[02:26:01.133 --> 02:26:02.494]  That's not even a relevant question.
[02:26:02.514 --> 02:26:05.256]  The question is, why don't people bear arms these days?
[02:26:05.896 --> 02:26:15.505]  Okay, you brought a sign that said the Tree of Liberty has to be watered with the blood of tyrants and you're carrying a goddamn gun at a presidential event.
[02:26:15.766 --> 02:26:18.368]  I think those things make people wonder what you're about.
[02:26:18.608 --> 02:26:20.670]  Right, the sign didn't say anything about blood.
[02:26:21.291 --> 02:26:21.952]  What did it say?
[02:26:21.972 --> 02:26:24.474]  It's time to water the Tree of Liberty.
[02:26:24.514 --> 02:26:26.316]  And where did that come from, that line?
[02:26:26.416 --> 02:26:27.517]  It's a quote from Thomas Jefferson.
[02:26:27.697 --> 02:26:29.398]  And what's the rest of the line?
[02:26:29.598 --> 02:26:31.819]  The rest of the line is for people to look up.
[02:26:31.859 --> 02:26:32.760]  It's not a soundbite.
[02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:34.161]  They need to understand the context.
[02:26:34.221 --> 02:26:36.182]  What's the rest of the line from Jefferson?
[02:26:36.702 --> 02:26:40.925]  The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of tyrants and patriots.
[02:26:41.045 --> 02:26:43.626]  Okay, well, you're carrying a gun and you're carrying that sign.
[02:26:43.906 --> 02:26:45.767]  And you don't think people should worry about you?
[02:26:46.408 --> 02:26:48.029]  No, I don't think people should worry about me.
[02:26:48.049 --> 02:26:51.851]  Well, let me ask you about the history of people that carried guns to presto events.
[02:26:52.091 --> 02:26:53.132]  Tell me that history, sir.
[02:26:55.393 --> 02:26:57.154]  Are you speaking of a particular event?
[02:26:57.374 --> 02:27:00.535]  I'm talking about people who bring guns to presidential events.
[02:27:00.775 --> 02:27:02.215]  Tell me their history.
[02:27:02.855 --> 02:27:03.756]  I'll tell you this, Chris.
[02:27:04.016 --> 02:27:05.196]  We just started New History.
[02:27:05.356 --> 02:27:06.416]  I was there today.
[02:27:06.476 --> 02:27:09.898]  There was a peaceful rally.
[02:27:10.318 --> 02:27:11.458]  No one was injured.
[02:27:11.498 --> 02:27:13.259]  No one on our side was alarmed.
[02:27:13.619 --> 02:27:15.159]  People in New Hampshire are used to violence.
[02:27:15.199 --> 02:27:17.700]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:20.621]  Run on for a long time.
[02:27:22.843 --> 02:27:28.568]  I want to thank Jared for staying up here late last night to get a hold of William Kostrick.
[02:27:28.869 --> 02:27:34.814]  When I first heard the news reporting this, it was like, a guy with an earpiece out there with a gun right in front of Obama.
[02:27:35.115 --> 02:27:36.976]  No, he was down the street at a private rally.
[02:27:37.757 --> 02:27:43.679]  In New Hampshire, where they're trying to reclaim their liberty by openly demonstrating the Second Amendment, that's how you get it back.
[02:27:44.099 --> 02:27:55.564]  They've got us to hide in our houses with it, to where now, every day or two, I see an article of some old man working on his rifle in his garage, and the neighbors in Texas call the police and they come arrest him, or in Illinois, or anywhere.
[02:27:56.641 --> 02:27:59.182]  So, William Kossrick does have a lot of courage to do that.
[02:27:59.262 --> 02:28:06.684]  Some other fellow today, hours before Obama even arrived in New Hampshire, they arrested him saying, was it illegal to have a gun without a permit?
[02:28:06.704 --> 02:28:10.465]  You don't have to have a permit to have a gun in New Hampshire, or most states.
[02:28:10.565 --> 02:28:13.206]  So, that just illustrates what he's talking about.
[02:28:13.226 --> 02:28:16.867]  He's with the Free States Project, he had a big Restore the Republic sign.
[02:28:17.388 --> 02:28:21.469]  We talked to Gary Franchi yesterday, Curt Nemo did, and said, no, no, we know that guy, he really is a patriot.
[02:28:22.029 --> 02:28:22.930]  Ah, it's good to be with you.
[02:28:42.301 --> 02:28:43.262]  Tell us about yourself.
[02:28:43.302 --> 02:28:45.483]  Tell us where you really were, what you were doing.
[02:28:46.163 --> 02:28:52.946]  I've seen very few people do as well with Chris Matthews, because he won't let you talk and sits there attacking you.
[02:28:54.067 --> 02:29:00.690]  I think you cleaned Chris Matthews' clock almost as good as when we went and shut him down with a bullhorn, but that's one in a million.
[02:29:01.071 --> 02:29:02.151]  Thanks to the great demonstrators.
[02:29:02.191 --> 02:29:04.592]  But no, no, seriously, one-on-one, you did a great job.
[02:29:04.893 --> 02:29:09.455]  I don't think I could have done a job as good as you did being calm while that weasel was talking to you.
[02:29:10.697 --> 02:29:13.338]  Well, I gotta tell you, I was sweating.
[02:29:13.438 --> 02:29:14.818]  It was rough.
[02:29:14.878 --> 02:29:15.859]  He's good at what he does.
[02:29:15.879 --> 02:29:18.360]  I don't hold him any ill will.
[02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:21.761]  I see a lot of people wrote some nasty things about him.
[02:29:21.801 --> 02:29:24.082]  You know, fact is, the name of the show is Hardball.
[02:29:24.422 --> 02:29:25.102]  That's what he does.
[02:29:26.263 --> 02:29:27.946]  That's what I expected walking in.
[02:29:28.927 --> 02:29:30.970]  I've been in sales for a while.
[02:29:30.990 --> 02:29:34.716]  I have a little bit of experience public speaking, so that helped out.
[02:29:34.856 --> 02:29:36.979]  But even so, it was pretty brutal.
[02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:42.027]  And I was glad watching it afterwards that everything went as well as it did.
[02:29:43.735 --> 02:29:48.399]  Absolutely, and people can watch the whole clip up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:29:48.740 --> 02:30:00.350]  Tell us about what you actually saw out at the event, and then what made you think, I'm going to go wear a sidearm on my side, and I'm going to have a sign saying, Water the Tree of Liberty.
[02:30:05.655 --> 02:30:08.818]  A fortuitous confluence of events.
[02:30:09.078 --> 02:30:14.743]  I was at some other activism in the state and was having a conversation with some folks.
[02:30:15.824 --> 02:30:24.452]  I wasn't even actually aware of the visit of the rally and it was just the day before.
[02:30:26.932 --> 02:30:27.713]  He's coming in.
[02:30:27.773 --> 02:30:29.355]  It's going to be a big deal.
[02:30:29.535 --> 02:30:33.540]  And I'm like, well, you know, someone should be there open carrying.
[02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:36.583]  And everybody kind of looked at me like I was a little off.
[02:30:36.643 --> 02:30:39.407]  And I said, well, you know, then I'll go do it.
[02:30:40.909 --> 02:30:46.451]  But what you're doing is so revolutionary that people wimp out on this.
[02:30:47.192 --> 02:30:54.034]  And even in Texas now, if you're trying to walk with a shotgun by your own ranch down the side of a highway, a cop will pull up and ask what you're doing.
[02:30:54.054 --> 02:30:58.316]  In America, no one dare carry a rifle in the back of their pickup truck anymore.
[02:30:58.376 --> 02:31:00.117]  Just 15 years ago, you saw it everywhere.
[02:31:00.357 --> 02:31:02.758]  They're killing our culture, you and others.
[02:31:02.818 --> 02:31:07.600]  I know Vermont, New Hampshire, Arizona, a few other states, people are open carrying everywhere.
[02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:08.340]  Colorado,
[02:31:08.940 --> 02:31:12.442]  And the slaves are having to learn that this is their right.
[02:31:12.502 --> 02:31:19.707]  I saw a violence policy center, Brady gun grab group on MSNBC this morning.
[02:31:20.067 --> 02:31:23.409]  They were talking about you and others viciously, how dangerous it is.
[02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:26.371]  But see, they've got all their armed police and all their weapons.
[02:31:26.651 --> 02:31:28.993]  They're threatened by their slaves.
[02:31:29.473 --> 02:31:37.598]  They're like Bengal tigers in the jungles of India, not liking to see a little deer suddenly grow big claws and fangs.
[02:31:38.078 --> 02:31:45.924]  So, we are their food, and of course they're going to want us to be declawed and defanged before they drop out of a tree like a boa constrictor and have their way with us.
[02:31:47.505 --> 02:32:01.995]  Yeah, it's interesting because the truth is, I don't know the exact number, but I think over 40 states it's legal to open carry-in, but the vast majority of those you don't dare unless you want to get your face slammed into the ground.
[02:32:02.575 --> 02:32:03.616]  And New Hampshire,
[02:32:04.336 --> 02:32:07.158]  Is a place where you still generally can.
[02:32:07.658 --> 02:32:11.521]  As activists, we have had a few incidents.
[02:32:11.921 --> 02:32:14.423]  Nothing brutal, but you know, minor harassment.
[02:32:14.723 --> 02:32:25.850]  And we've gone, spoke to the police chief, spoke to the media, spoke to the mayor, and educated them on that everyone who's carrying a firearm is not a criminal.
[02:32:26.130 --> 02:32:29.973]  And that's why it's important for people to do it regularly.
[02:32:30.683 --> 02:32:36.244]  To be seen doing it so that people don't make the assumption when they see a firearm that it's a criminal.
[02:32:36.605 --> 02:32:44.406]  They need to see it so often that when they see it, the assumption is, that's a law-abiding citizen, that's my neighbor, that's a guy that I can trust.
[02:32:45.467 --> 02:32:49.308]  Well, what you're doing is as revolutionary as it gets to restore the republic.
[02:32:50.168 --> 02:32:53.069]  And, uh, Mr. Kostrich, I can only commend what you're doing.
[02:32:56.896 --> 02:33:05.710]  I'm glad that you guys were able to talk to Gary and clear up, at least on your side, this whole agent provocateur thing.
[02:33:05.730 --> 02:33:09.677]  It still seems pretty widespread in other areas of the world.
[02:33:10.874 --> 02:33:20.264]  Well, I mean, we see the Fed's provocative stuff constantly, and so nine times out of ten it is.
[02:33:20.284 --> 02:33:28.372]  And then to see somebody with incredible courage like yourself, because it's one thing to do open carry in New Hampshire or Colorado or Vermont or Arizona.
[02:33:29.551 --> 02:33:48.962]  At some event or when you're out doing business but I mean when the president's coming around again just amazing courage on your part and I don't think it's really an apology but more of a correction that well we didn't say you were fed for sure we said we'll find out and we did man and then corrected it again your bold courage and Thomas Jefferson spirit
[02:33:49.822 --> 02:34:17.791]  uh... just uh... you know really puts us to shame so we commend you uh... but absolutely what was it like when you were out there what was it like you were talking to the fellow who was out there I guess a few blocks away from where Obama was at on private property with a handgun strapped to his hip uh... to his thigh uh... and the water the tree of liberty uh... quote uh... from Thomas Jefferson I was in the thick of the protesting area for a good half hour
[02:34:18.891 --> 02:34:19.752]  Forty minutes?
[02:34:19.932 --> 02:34:21.332]  I don't know, at least a half an hour.
[02:34:21.352 --> 02:34:31.018]  And many of the state police, the local police, they'd walked past me numerous times, countless times already.
[02:34:33.997 --> 02:34:47.350]  You know, I'm there holding my sign, and then we see them moving through the crowd looking down, and someone said to me, oh, they're checking people's hands, and of course I knew at that moment that no, they're looking for me.
[02:34:47.370 --> 02:34:56.199]  So, you know, I just waited there with my sign, and the gentleman who came up to me, Lieutenant McDonald,
[02:34:56.779 --> 02:34:58.921]  I was very cordial, extremely polite.
[02:34:58.941 --> 02:35:06.125]  I saw someone say on one of the comments that, oh, if a cop sees someone with a gun at something like this, they don't just walk up and say hi.
[02:35:06.165 --> 02:35:07.886]  Well, that's exactly what happened.
[02:35:08.527 --> 02:35:12.950]  He walked up, he introduced himself, he said, would you mind stepping off to the side and speaking with me?
[02:35:13.730 --> 02:35:13.990]  I did.
[02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:20.034]  We have video of the entire encounter from the time he walked up to the end of it.
[02:35:21.075 --> 02:35:22.336]  Very cordial, very polite.
[02:35:23.057 --> 02:35:24.497]  Is that posted yet?
[02:35:24.558 --> 02:35:27.279]  I'd like to play that here because we're also doing a TV show right now.
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:31.582]  It is nowhere online as of right now.
[02:35:31.742 --> 02:35:33.003]  We need to get that up on YouTube.
[02:35:34.934 --> 02:35:36.816]  We've been working on that.
[02:35:37.337 --> 02:35:38.057]  We've been working on it.
[02:35:38.758 --> 02:35:39.138]  Well, good.
[02:35:39.218 --> 02:35:40.439]  Can't wait to see that.
[02:35:40.539 --> 02:35:43.162]  Actually, there were several cameras on the scene.
[02:35:43.222 --> 02:35:43.382]  Good.
[02:35:43.422 --> 02:35:46.324]  Is there a website that we should look for it to service on?
[02:35:47.425 --> 02:35:47.826]  Not yet.
[02:35:49.087 --> 02:35:51.869]  Okay, well, I mean, on YouTube, what are you going to call the video?
[02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:57.054]  Patriot... Wow.
[02:35:57.654 --> 02:35:58.175]  What do you suggest?
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:03.444]  No, no, I'm just thinking because I want to post it on InfoWars and Prison Planet as soon as it comes up, William.
[02:36:03.824 --> 02:36:07.568]  As soon as we get it taken care of, you'll be the first to know.
[02:36:08.028 --> 02:36:08.829]  I'll send you an update.
[02:36:10.990 --> 02:36:11.250]  You bet.
[02:36:11.270 --> 02:36:15.011]  Well, I always talk about how we've got to save the gun culture by exercising it openly.
[02:36:15.031 --> 02:36:20.272]  Because, I mean, it's gotten to the point in Texas where a carpet cleaner comes to your house and sees a gun case and calls the cops.
[02:36:20.612 --> 02:36:27.694]  Because they live on TV land and they think because everything's based in New York and Chicago on these dramas that those cop shows are real.
[02:36:27.994 --> 02:36:30.815]  The general public thinks those actors are real people.
[02:36:31.315 --> 02:36:33.936]  I mean, the public's, like, literally under mind control.
[02:36:34.356 --> 02:36:36.716]  And so they come to your house and think your guns are illegal.
[02:36:37.037 --> 02:36:38.437]  So what you're doing is invaluable.
[02:36:39.277 --> 02:36:42.901]  But what was it like once the national media contacted you?
[02:36:42.921 --> 02:36:44.663]  Were you like, how did you do that?
[02:36:44.683 --> 02:36:46.585]  I mean, Chris Matthews didn't know what to do.
[02:36:46.825 --> 02:36:58.096]  The fact that we're not cowed, that you're not cowed, that people are breaking their spell, and that you weren't apologetic to him, that was just devastating.
[02:36:58.766 --> 02:37:03.529]  Well, the way it went down, yeah, unremorseful.
[02:37:03.869 --> 02:37:09.532]  I think that's the way I'm labeled on the Arianna Huffington site, amazingly enough.
[02:37:09.632 --> 02:37:27.623]  So, yeah, what happened is he went ahead and asked me to, if I was aware of the federal law 1,000 feet from a school, I said that I was, that there were exceptions to that, that I was an exception to that, and he called it in, he said basically that
[02:37:29.594 --> 02:37:39.921]  Uh, that doesn't matter, that because it's a school, that they can ask me to leave, and if I refuse to leave, then I would be arrested, in fact, for trespassing.
[02:37:40.682 --> 02:37:42.463]  So the cop said this to you?
[02:37:42.483 --> 02:37:43.924]  Um, he did.
[02:37:44.445 --> 02:37:52.010]  Once again, he was very polite, he was calling in, checking back with whoever was in charge there.
[02:37:53.091 --> 02:37:56.213]  But you can't have a slave with a gun near the emperor, okay.
[02:37:56.980 --> 02:38:07.576]  Well, you did say we're going to have to move you 1,000 feet, and then this is where things just got really amazing, because I said, well, okay, I mean, where is the 1,000 foot line?
[02:38:10.214 --> 02:38:11.234]  And he didn't know.
[02:38:11.474 --> 02:38:15.195]  So he got on the phone and started trying to find out.
[02:38:15.876 --> 02:38:21.957]  Meanwhile, there's been such a ruckus that these news agencies are starting to come up and talk to me.
[02:38:22.417 --> 02:38:26.779]  So actually, it took him about 10 to 12 minutes to get an answer back.
[02:38:26.859 --> 02:38:30.680]  Meanwhile, I'm conducting interviews with the Boston Globe, the New York Post.
[02:38:31.140 --> 02:38:32.780]  I mean, they're coming up right there.
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:34.961]  And so he comes back.
[02:38:35.871 --> 02:38:42.573]  And he says, well, we're going to ask you to move down to the end of the block, past the barricade.
[02:38:43.393 --> 02:38:46.554]  And I said, well, that's more than 1,000 feet.
[02:38:47.314 --> 02:38:51.755]  And he's like, well, I don't really know where the 1,000 feet is, but that's what we're going to ask you to do.
[02:38:52.535 --> 02:38:58.417]  And he said, I can't even tell you if I would arrest you if you refuse to do that, because, you know, he was...
[02:38:59.315 --> 02:39:10.305]  He was clearly not wanting to arrest me and he wasn't going to do so unless ordered by higher-ups is the impression that I was getting.
[02:39:11.927 --> 02:39:19.594]  So at this point I had to make a judgment call and I was undecided as to what the right thing to do here was.
[02:39:21.508 --> 02:39:33.579]  At that time, he got a call on his cell phone and who exactly it was, I'm not 100%, I believe that it was the police chief who
[02:39:34.778 --> 02:39:48.106]  Came through and said that apparently right maybe 30 feet from where I was currently standing when this whole incident started that there was a church and that church was private property and therefore I would be alright there.
[02:39:48.467 --> 02:39:57.192]  So instead of pushing the thousand foot permit issue I just moved over and that's where I stood through the rest of the event.
[02:39:58.049 --> 02:40:02.631]  Well, the issue here is we've been trained by the police that we can't have our rifles in our cars.
[02:40:03.112 --> 02:40:03.892]  There's no law.
[02:40:04.532 --> 02:40:07.694]  They'll just beat you in the head with a club and find something to take you to prison for.
[02:40:08.074 --> 02:40:10.455]  We have to teach them that's illegal and criminal.
[02:40:11.035 --> 02:40:13.337]  Even in Texas, we've been castrated.
[02:40:13.757 --> 02:40:19.400]  You obviously haven't been in Vermont, Arizona, and New Hampshire, and a few areas of Colorado.
[02:40:20.220 --> 02:40:21.061]  I commend you.
[02:40:22.221 --> 02:40:23.102]  It's just amazing.
[02:40:23.122 --> 02:40:27.524]  We should start a national organization, somebody should, for having these events in numbers.
[02:40:28.365 --> 02:40:32.247]  I know the Black Panthers, and I support what they did in Houston, marched armed.
[02:40:33.428 --> 02:40:34.989]  Because this is our right of free humans.
[02:40:35.109 --> 02:40:44.595]  And if we allow them through the common law to restrict us, practice is a large part of the law.
[02:40:45.415 --> 02:40:46.656]  And it becomes the common law.
[02:40:47.551 --> 02:40:48.211]  Go ahead.
[02:40:48.672 --> 02:40:49.092]  Exactly.
[02:40:49.152 --> 02:40:52.113]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:40:52.253 --> 02:40:53.594]  And I lived in Arizona.
[02:40:53.634 --> 02:40:54.434]  I came from Arizona.
[02:40:54.455 --> 02:40:59.777]  And I moved to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project to work to achieve liberty in our lifetime.
[02:41:00.217 --> 02:41:03.279]  And Arizona's not a half bad state.
[02:41:03.499 --> 02:41:05.339]  State when it comes to gun laws, right?
[02:41:05.359 --> 02:41:09.760]  But they started doing the, uh, they were one of the first states to go with the real ID.
[02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:18.522]  We had Governor Napolitano and, uh, I saw what was happening in New Hampshire and I said, you know, that's the last bastion of freedom.
[02:41:18.542 --> 02:41:22.143]  This is where the nanny staters, uh, don't want to be, right?
[02:41:22.323 --> 02:41:24.584]  Yeah, we have to... This is the state that has
[02:41:26.824 --> 02:41:28.307]  No state income tax.
[02:41:28.427 --> 02:41:31.431]  It's the last state that has no seatbelt laws.
[02:41:31.511 --> 02:41:33.414]  It has no mandatory insurance.
[02:41:33.995 --> 02:41:40.484]  I mean, there's so many things that the live free or die state, the spirit of the locals, they live that way.
[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:43.902]  Yeah, we have to make it the custom again.
[02:41:44.323 --> 02:41:48.707]  We have to practice and exercise these freedoms or they atrophy and die.
[02:41:49.088 --> 02:41:54.793]  To the point of now, you gotta hide your guns with repair people in Texas because they think they're illegal and they want a bounty.
[02:41:55.073 --> 02:42:00.399]  The billboards everywhere say report illegal guns, show a picture of a revolver, the moron public.
[02:42:01.139 --> 02:42:01.580]  I just don't.
[02:42:15.976 --> 02:42:24.766]  I just saw the headline coming out of England where apparently I am labeled a gunman and interestingly in some of the articles that I've read I'm labeled a loner.
[02:42:24.786 --> 02:42:30.332]  So I've been labeled a loner and a gunman but so far not a lone gunman.
[02:42:31.133 --> 02:42:36.757]  Maybe you fire magic bullets that can shoot through two or three people through a bunch of bones and metal and not be damaged.
[02:42:37.317 --> 02:42:45.943]  Maybe you're like the Lucky Charms leprechaun that you hop around like the Fighting Irish with gold coins shooting out of your mouth.
[02:42:46.343 --> 02:42:47.324]  Stay there, Mr. Kostrik.
[02:42:47.344 --> 02:42:48.825]  I want to get a few final comments from you.
[02:42:49.265 --> 02:42:51.026]  Maybe have you up for a full hour in the near future.
[02:42:51.046 --> 02:42:54.689]  You're a very interesting person, and New Hampshire sounds like a better and better place to live.
[02:42:57.242 --> 02:43:04.849]  Robert Beatle's new book, Here's What You Do, was written for anyone who wants to survive the upcoming and ongoing financial storm.
[02:43:05.029 --> 02:43:09.914]  Get prepared and go to here'swhatyoudo.net and buy the $6 book.
[02:43:10.094 --> 02:43:15.619]  He is also trying to help us by running for Congress to stop the thievery and loss of liberties.
[02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:16.779]  We're good to go.
[02:43:36.104 --> 02:43:36.464]  We're good.
[02:43:58.149 --> 02:44:03.476]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:44:04.176 --> 02:44:09.523]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:44:10.063 --> 02:44:16.231]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:44:16.551 --> 02:44:18.372]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:44:18.512 --> 02:44:20.914]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:44:20.994 --> 02:44:31.921]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:44:34.163 --> 02:44:35.463]  It's not about left or right.
[02:44:35.844 --> 02:44:37.224]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:44:37.705 --> 02:44:43.949]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:44:44.605 --> 02:44:52.368]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:44:52.869 --> 02:44:54.009]  The Obama Deception.
[02:44:54.449 --> 02:44:55.630]  The people strike back!
[02:44:57.438 --> 02:45:04.442]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[02:45:04.662 --> 02:45:08.324]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[02:45:08.624 --> 02:45:16.689]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[02:45:16.949 --> 02:45:19.651]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[02:45:19.831 --> 02:45:22.372]  You push a button, and within a certain distance, your door opens.
[02:45:22.632 --> 02:45:26.815]  Thieves get near you, push a button, and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[02:45:27.355 --> 02:45:27.875]  Let's do it!
[02:45:57.791 --> 02:46:00.134]  William Costner, we gotta have him back up soon.
[02:46:00.154 --> 02:46:00.855]  I noticed a line.
[02:46:00.875 --> 02:46:04.159]  They arrested a guy in New Hampshire hours before Obama even got there.
[02:46:15.573 --> 02:46:17.514]  Somewhere near where he was going to speak.
[02:46:17.854 --> 02:46:19.355]  They're looking in cars for guns.
[02:46:19.876 --> 02:46:22.237]  And they said he was arrested for not having a registered gun.
[02:46:22.597 --> 02:46:24.919]  There's no registry law in New Hampshire.
[02:46:25.299 --> 02:46:26.960]  So I wanted to ask Mr. Kossrick about that.
[02:46:26.980 --> 02:46:29.982]  I kept saying, hearing in the news, your gun was registered.
[02:46:30.242 --> 02:46:34.204]  Let me guess, there's no reason to register a gun when there's no law to register it.
[02:46:34.224 --> 02:46:39.567]  That's more of that mass lie as if the whole country is New York City and lower Manhattan.
[02:46:39.847 --> 02:46:42.189]  Let me guess, your gun wasn't registered and it was all a lie.
[02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:43.841]  That is correct.
[02:46:44.162 --> 02:46:45.423]  That is correct.
[02:46:45.524 --> 02:46:48.187]  My gun was neither registered nor was it required to be.
[02:46:48.207 --> 02:46:56.460]  And interestingly, to the horror of many out there, they didn't, they at no point even asked me for ID.
[02:46:57.994 --> 02:47:05.878]  At no point during the event, during the footage, all the time that I talked to the cops, all the time that they asked me, you know, to please relocate.
[02:47:06.518 --> 02:47:07.439]  The whole thing.
[02:47:07.459 --> 02:47:09.319]  I was never even asked.
[02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:13.221]  Well, the truth is, if you were a criminal that wanted to go after the President, it wouldn't be open.
[02:47:13.501 --> 02:47:19.324]  That's why they have a permit for a concealed, because it's illegal under common law to conceal a weapon.
[02:47:19.404 --> 02:47:21.085]  Only criminals and murderers do that.
[02:47:21.465 --> 02:47:23.146]  Free men wear weapons openly.
[02:47:23.706 --> 02:47:26.347]  And we need to get back to being free men, not slaves.
[02:47:26.407 --> 02:47:33.209]  In England and others, those poor people, now they're putting cameras in the parents' rooms, watching them 24 hours a day.
[02:47:33.569 --> 02:47:37.070]  That's what happens when they get your guns in Australia, in England.
[02:47:37.410 --> 02:47:39.711]  Mr. Kostrick, are there any websites you want to plug?
[02:47:41.972 --> 02:47:47.773]  Freestateproject.org, New Hampshire Liberty Alliance, and start there.
[02:47:47.793 --> 02:47:51.975]  There are a dozen great, off the top of my head,
[02:47:54.290 --> 02:47:55.912]  Liberty Activist Group.
[02:47:56.452 --> 02:47:58.454]  I've got more looking forward to being back.
[02:48:12.816 --> 02:48:13.056]  You bet.
[02:48:13.076 --> 02:48:13.977]  We look forward to having you all.
[02:48:13.997 --> 02:48:15.537]  I'll have Jaren set you up next week.
[02:48:15.558 --> 02:48:15.878]  Thank you.
[02:48:16.398 --> 02:48:21.161]  I just wanted to add before the show ended that I was just watching a scene in there in the break, that same congressman.
[02:48:21.601 --> 02:48:27.204]  They are loving the swastika on the congressman's sign.
[02:48:27.224 --> 02:48:30.345]  Because he screamed at his constituents and told them they were basically scum.
[02:48:30.706 --> 02:48:32.827]  It backfired and somebody went and sprayed that.
[02:48:33.147 --> 02:48:34.848]  That swastika is saving his butt.
[02:48:36.104 --> 02:48:42.535]  And I bet if it does come out in the wash, somebody affiliated with the congressman sprayed that because people have been caught.
[02:48:42.575 --> 02:48:48.044]  We did an article about people being caught putting swastikas on their own property at the dorms and churches and everywhere else.
[02:48:48.264 --> 02:48:49.005]  We're sick of it.
[02:48:50.103 --> 02:48:51.064]  And this is what they're going to do.
[02:48:51.084 --> 02:48:54.025]  They're going to victimize themselves to demonize us.
[02:48:54.766 --> 02:48:55.266]  Guaranteed.
[02:48:55.286 --> 02:48:56.687]  We've got a minute and a half left.
[02:48:57.087 --> 02:49:00.409]  I've twisted Ted's arm because gold is up again right now.
[02:49:00.709 --> 02:49:08.854]  He still has gold left from three weeks ago, gold and silver, when gold was almost $60 lower than it is now, and silver was a couple bucks lower than it is now.
[02:49:09.154 --> 02:49:14.337]  But he is almost running out of this, and if it keeps going up, there's not... I've never seen him extend the offer this long.
[02:49:14.617 --> 02:49:17.859]  Quickly, Ted, tell folks about the coins and the number here at the end of the show.
[02:49:18.553 --> 02:49:21.215]  Yeah, walking Liberty Halves right now at $8.69.
[02:49:22.095 --> 02:49:26.739]  The Frank coin is still currently at $216, and the British Sovereign is at $266.
[02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:34.003]  All those coins are relative to gold sitting around $9.11, silver closer to $11 an ounce.
[02:49:34.364 --> 02:49:45.931]  Of course, we all know that silver's been poking into $15 and gold into the $9.60 level, so there's been a great movement forward, and I'm just grateful that there's a couple of little dips in the time here.
[02:49:45.951 --> 02:49:48.113]  Just yesterday I was able to accumulate something else.
[02:49:48.593 --> 02:49:53.360]  And keep my average cost down, so want to pass the savings on to the listeners, that's for sure.
[02:49:53.763 --> 02:49:54.443]  800-686-2237.
[02:49:54.463 --> 02:49:54.503]  800-686-2237.
[02:49:55.544 --> 02:50:03.986]  The lying media says don't get gold, but all the wealthy people have been piling in on it.
[02:50:04.306 --> 02:50:06.167]  You cannot beat this deal.
[02:50:06.187 --> 02:50:07.127]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:08.348 --> 02:50:13.989]  Brokers will be there till midnight tonight, and I'm sure Ted can hold that deal into tomorrow, so don't wait.
[02:50:14.009 --> 02:50:14.049]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:15.370 --> 02:50:19.251]  Even if it's a silver half dollar, a silver dollar, a quarter ounce gold coin,
[02:50:19.671 --> 02:50:20.732]  Or 100 ounces of gold.
[02:50:20.752 --> 02:50:22.153]  They got your needs.
[02:50:22.174 --> 02:50:22.914]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:23.134 --> 02:50:25.136]  Great job, crew.
[02:50:25.236 --> 02:50:25.937]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:50:26.578 --> 02:50:27.098]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:50:27.579 --> 02:50:27.819]  You bet.
[02:50:27.839 --> 02:50:31.002]  And great job to John Harmon up in Minnesota, up in Mission Control.
[02:50:31.042 --> 02:50:32.884]  Great job to Cape Canaveral down here.
[02:50:32.904 --> 02:50:33.905]  Free transmission.
[02:50:34.005 --> 02:50:35.066]  Powerful transmission.
[02:50:35.286 --> 02:50:37.228]  Coming up now, InfoWars.com.
[02:50:38.809 --> 02:50:40.851]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:50:46.889 --> 02:50:51.874]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:50:52.095 --> 02:50:55.899]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:50:56.119 --> 02:51:01.745]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:51:02.046 --> 02:51:06.891]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:51:07.111 --> 02:51:07.612]  Number three,
[02:51:08.012 --> 02:51:13.456]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:51:14.297 --> 02:51:16.959]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:51:17.199 --> 02:51:20.602]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:51:21.723 --> 02:51:25.326]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:51:25.566 --> 02:51:31.067]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
