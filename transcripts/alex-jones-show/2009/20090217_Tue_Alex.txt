[00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:16.605]  We have a guest coming up, D.H.
[00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:26.812]  Williams, who writes for the Daily Newscaster about Inside Source Reveals FEMA and Department of Homeland Security preparing for mass graves and martial law.
[00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.415]  So that is coming up in the next segment.
[00:01:30.975 --> 00:01:33.177]  An amazing interview I did with him Sunday.
[00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:35.059]  We ran out of time, so I wanted to have him back up today.
[00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.020]  Right now, let's continue with your phone calls.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.643]  We'll have calls, by the way, throughout this final hour as well.
[00:01:40.703 --> 00:01:42.764]  Well, the next two hours as well.
[00:01:42.804 --> 00:01:43.525]  We have two hours left.
[00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:46.722]  Or an hour and 58 minutes, to be precise.
[00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:52.243]  Up next is Susan in Minnesota.
[00:01:52.303 --> 00:01:53.323]  You're on the air, Susan.
[00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:54.964]  Hi, Alex.
[00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:59.245]  I just wanted to tell you, you did a great job with Coast to Coast yesterday.
[00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:13.729]  I found it to be so inspiring to find out that maybe there might be more than 20 states already drawing that line in the sand, telling the federal government, no, we will not allow the FEMA camp for the gun confiscations or
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.902]  As you pointed out, the forced vaccinations, this is so critical and so important.
[00:02:20.883 --> 00:02:24.744]  I think it should encourage a lot of people to revisit the 9th and 10th Amendment.
[00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.786]  The information that you gave was just so amazing.
[00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:32.187]  I was so impressed with how articulate you were on the show.
[00:02:33.147 --> 00:02:41.791]  And I think it should hopefully be encouraging for a lot of people to call their representatives and remind them and encourage them to also do the same thing.
[00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:47.232]  I just wanted to briefly also say something about Larry Pratt, who you've had on there many times.
[00:02:47.752 --> 00:02:55.517]  I think that should also be a reminder of people that if they're in the NRA, they should get out and get into Gun Owners of America with Larry Pratt.
[00:02:56.257 --> 00:02:59.919]  I don't know if you're familiar, I think you are, I've talked about David Olufsen.
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:11.086]  He's the individual who was recently charged with having a semi-automatic weapon that misfired that they decided to define as an automatic weapon.
[00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:20.197]  Which of course, a lot of people should be alarmed by the fact that if they have a gun that misfires, it suddenly may be defined as an automatic weapon.
[00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:28.050]  And the BATF admitted that, you know, he sold somebody a gun that had a gun range, misfired and fired two rounds.
[00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:30.692]  And they admitted it was a legal AR-15 he bought.
[00:03:30.732 --> 00:03:32.294]  He was currently in the Army.
[00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:35.316]  He'd just been honorably discharged in the National Guard.
[00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:41.060]  And he's now serving, what is it, a 10-year prison sentence.
[00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:44.883]  And in fact, I meant to play a Lou Dobbs clip on that Monday.
[00:03:44.943 --> 00:03:46.745]  John, you have that clip I sent you, don't you?
[00:03:47.285 --> 00:03:48.366]  That we never got to yesterday?
[00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.394]  Yeah, it was the Lou Dobbs on the Mr. Olson case.
[00:03:52.614 --> 00:03:59.644]  Folks can go to GunOwners.org and they've got the video on their main page, at least they did Sunday, and you can see that clip right there.
[00:03:59.704 --> 00:04:00.145]  But no, no, no.
[00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:02.568]  They want to go after American gun owners.
[00:04:02.728 --> 00:04:04.951]  They've got bills introduced all over different states.
[00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:15.514]  Those scores of states where the ammo is stamped and registered to you every time you buy it, and then you have to turn it in every two years to four years, depending on the state.
[00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:18.255]  You know, you can't keep your ammo.
[00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:19.695]  I mean, you know, this is insane.
[00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:21.776]  They're coming after our Second Amendment.
[00:04:22.476 --> 00:04:23.096]  Right, that's right.
[00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:27.457]  And the poor people that don't know this, when you do join Gun Owners of America,
[00:04:27.964 --> 00:04:34.313]  They also, not only do they provide you with a lot of the information, but they do have a legal staff and support for you.
[00:04:35.294 --> 00:04:39.279]  They're actually defending Mr. Olsen and they've got the Supreme Court case and all that.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.561]  I mean, they're it.
[00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:41.602]  They're the real gun group.
[00:04:41.943 --> 00:04:44.666]  The real Second Amendment group, the NRA, is an enemy.
[00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:49.570]  Cloaked operation, a double agent, there's no doubt, and Larry Pratt's laid all that out on air.
[00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:52.873]  And I'm the one that pushed Pratt to go public with all the history of the NRA.
[00:04:52.913 --> 00:04:53.514]  He finally did it.
[00:04:53.874 --> 00:04:55.696]  That's been defeating our enemy, the NRA.
[00:04:56.096 --> 00:04:57.037]  All right, good to hear from you.
[00:04:57.057 --> 00:05:06.184]  We'll come back and take more phone calls, ladies and gentlemen, right here on the one and the only GCN Radio Network, simulcasting with InfoWarsPrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:07.285 --> 00:05:12.951]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:05:13.131 --> 00:05:18.276]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:23.641]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:27.505]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:29.506]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[00:05:29.826 --> 00:05:32.568]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[00:05:32.768 --> 00:05:35.829]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:39.591]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:05:39.831 --> 00:05:44.394]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:05:44.654 --> 00:05:45.454]  Do your part.
[00:05:45.714 --> 00:05:47.976]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[00:07:06.383 --> 00:07:08.986]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.561]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:16.342]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:22.883]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[00:07:23.283 --> 00:07:28.324]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[00:07:28.504 --> 00:07:35.206]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.

[00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:14.757]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:15.357 --> 00:08:18.338]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.830]  We are back live simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.832]  Let me blitz through some of the headlines we haven't covered and recap some of the other top stories.
[00:08:27.872 --> 00:08:30.533]  We're going to our guest for the balance of the hour and taking your phone calls.
[00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:33.614]  Clinton says don't blame him for the economic crisis.
[00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:35.956]  This is from Yahoo News.
[00:08:36.896 --> 00:08:43.299]  Of course, in Time Magazine, the bigger issue here is that it was actually, if you want to mete out blame,
[00:08:44.648 --> 00:08:55.991]  Bush is involved, they're all working together, Obama's involved, but it was the Clinton administration that did get rid of the Glass-Steagall Act and did change the laws, and is most to blame for what the bankers have done.
[00:08:56.371 --> 00:09:05.093]  And then Time Magazine has another story, 25 people to blame for the financial crisis, and they don't blame any of the real people.
[00:09:06.374 --> 00:09:10.395]  They go after the top 25 people, they don't blame any of the real ones.
[00:09:11.471 --> 00:09:14.652]  They got Madoff and George Bush and people like that.
[00:09:14.692 --> 00:09:16.093]  These are not the real architects.
[00:09:16.113 --> 00:09:18.494]  These are high-level criminals involved in it.
[00:09:19.494 --> 00:09:21.475]  So we'll get into that.
[00:09:21.535 --> 00:09:26.217]  Also, Leahy is under a lot of pressure to at least probe Bush wrongdoings.
[00:09:26.558 --> 00:09:32.980]  The problem is he won't be lined up with his party's own president, who has now endorsed the torture, the secret arrest, everything else.
[00:09:33.861 --> 00:09:36.742]  Leahy's plan to probe Bush-era wrongdoings, the right
[00:09:37.282 --> 00:09:41.908]  Screams that it's a witch hunt, the left complains it's a cop-out, and President Obama wishes it would just go away.
[00:09:42.168 --> 00:09:42.308]  Aww.
[00:09:42.629 --> 00:09:46.974]  But Senator Patrick Leahy isn't about to drop his proposal for a truth commission, that's like a U.N.
[00:09:46.994 --> 00:09:49.197]  thing, to investigate wrongdoing in the Bush administration.
[00:09:49.557 --> 00:09:53.823]  We would be making a mistake for history's purpose if we walk away from this, the Vermont Democrats said.
[00:09:56.226 --> 00:09:58.867]  that dovetails with this report here today.
[00:09:58.887 --> 00:10:06.151]  Now the Associated Press, Obama's Justice Department, standing by George Bush's secrecy and the things that he's doing.
[00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:08.992]  I said I would get to this a little bit earlier.
[00:10:09.573 --> 00:10:14.815]  If you just Google, call or ask about Tony Blair and Francois Mitterrand, all these world leaders involved in the occult.
[00:10:16.336 --> 00:10:20.838]  You just Google Tony Blair occult and witchcraft and nail clippings, the weird world of Sherry Blair.
[00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:24.360]  Even by the standards of the alternative therapist,
[00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:34.018]  Uh, said to be used by Sherry Blair, submitting her husband's toenail clippings to a health guru's pendulums, uh, is taking her alleged new age obsession to a higher level.
[00:10:34.038 --> 00:10:34.178]  Ms.
[00:10:34.218 --> 00:10:43.844]  Blair's human rights lawyer has long been the subject of claims about a fondness for weird and wonderful treatments, ranging from Mayan rebirthing ceremony to eating strawberry leaves to cure swollen ankles.
[00:10:44.424 --> 00:10:49.868]  So they kind of whitewash it and then they get into bizarre, uh, occult practices here in the article.
[00:10:50.928 --> 00:10:56.614]  And you can find articles about him channeling the spirit of the light and all the rest of this craziness.
[00:10:58.036 --> 00:11:02.240]  We've got it up on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv for folks.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.061]  That's just one of the articles.
[00:11:04.643 --> 00:11:06.785]  Type in Francois Mitterand.
[00:11:11.531 --> 00:11:21.281]  Louvre Pyramid 666 with 666 pieces of glass and him doing rituals when it was completed right before he left the presidency before Jacques Chirac.
[00:11:22.302 --> 00:11:26.666]  And then now we have the Nicolas Sarkozy.
[00:11:27.682 --> 00:11:28.783]  Not even French, as usual.
[00:11:29.624 --> 00:11:31.486]  But right now, let's go to D.H.
[00:11:31.586 --> 00:11:32.007]  Williams.
[00:11:32.027 --> 00:11:34.790]  He wrote the story for the Daily Newscaster.
[00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:36.992]  Inside Source Reels, FEMA and D.H.
[00:11:37.032 --> 00:11:39.315]  are preparing for mass graves in Marshall Law.
[00:11:39.635 --> 00:11:43.740]  He confirmed they have the tape, but we're not saying.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.503]  I've learned the county and who it is.
[00:11:47.003 --> 00:11:55.546]  But for his, he doesn't want to be public at this time, you know, telling him about mass graves, hardening of government facilities in a rural area of cornfields.
[00:11:56.006 --> 00:11:57.066]  They want to know where everything is.
[00:11:57.106 --> 00:12:01.508]  And the city official, the county official of emergency management thought that this was a preparation for martial law.
[00:12:01.988 --> 00:12:02.748]  But I had D.H.
[00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:15.092]  Williams on with us and he was very, very informative about what Doug Williams, and he'd also been in special forces, so he talked about how they were, you know, they trained
[00:12:16.365 --> 00:12:18.466]  I'm happy to be here, and thanks for having me back on, Alex.
[00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:18.806]  You bet.
[00:12:18.826 --> 00:12:22.448]  I was cutting in a lot in those short segments on the weekend Sunday show.
[00:12:22.488 --> 00:12:25.409]  Recap the total picture here, what's happening, and why this is such a concern.
[00:12:46.038 --> 00:12:52.447]  Well, what's happened recently is there's been a municipal official in a county in Indiana, not far from Chicago.
[00:12:52.487 --> 00:12:54.610]  You'll pull out a map, you can kind of locate the area.
[00:12:55.604 --> 00:13:19.022]  And they're required, each county is required to have at least six meetings with FEMA officials and or Department of Homeland Security officials to set up various programs, plans, gather data, identify infrastructure in towns, and just basically gather a lot of information without telling people what they're doing with it.
[00:13:20.043 --> 00:13:24.447]  This individual was part of those meetings and after
[00:13:25.268 --> 00:13:30.551]  Attending all the mandatory meetings, having the phone conversations, filling out extensive questionnaires.
[00:13:31.672 --> 00:13:40.456]  He became suspicious of the goals and motives, particularly when they were not fully forthcoming to him with information.
[00:13:40.496 --> 00:13:45.039]  They would sidestep answers or give vague general answers to questions.
[00:13:46.616 --> 00:13:58.145]  They were all so deceptive in the questions, claiming, we want you to harden city buildings for jumbo jets flying into them, and the next, oh, it's for high winds.
[00:14:00.267 --> 00:14:00.887]  Exactly.
[00:14:00.947 --> 00:14:04.771]  I mean, there's deception in their questions, and what kind of answer is that?
[00:14:04.831 --> 00:14:08.253]  I mean, how do you harden all of your buildings in a county against a 747?
[00:14:08.313 --> 00:14:11.436]  That's such an unlikely scenario, it just doesn't make sense.
[00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.751]  Being with Special Forces in the U.S.
[00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:18.572]  Army, what does make sense to harden government buildings?
[00:14:19.152 --> 00:14:29.757]  Well, I tell you what, I'm not, first thing, I don't believe in a static defense, so I would say that that's a bad, my training says that's not a good idea.
[00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:36.401]  My concern would be the planning and the preparation, that's what's the real concern.
[00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:42.904]  You know, the information about hardening and possible plane crashes, that's, you know, I think that's just
[00:14:43.911 --> 00:14:46.553]  The agent trying to cover up what they're really interested in.
[00:14:46.993 --> 00:14:50.056]  Also, they may not know fully what the information's for.
[00:14:50.796 --> 00:14:52.537]  You know, people are compartmentalized.
[00:14:52.597 --> 00:14:56.260]  They are only given what they need in generalities to complete their objectives.
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:01.204]  And they probably don't know the extent of the plan, even if they can imagine what it might be.
[00:15:03.065 --> 00:15:03.786]  Absolutely.
[00:15:04.166 --> 00:15:10.471]  Continue with the overall, you know, what's happening there in Illinois and Indiana and surrounding areas.
[00:15:10.651 --> 00:15:12.052]  Recaps from what we discussed Sunday.
[00:15:13.086 --> 00:15:19.991]  Well, basically this official had some meetings with DHS and FEMA, other counties.
[00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:39.325]  They brought everybody to Indianapolis for a meeting in late December of 2008, where they were basically told that, hey, GM could collapse, the economy's in horrible shape, we could see mass unemployment, we could see counties lose up to 40% of their funds, and what's going to follow is unrest and depression.
[00:15:40.066 --> 00:15:42.107]  And we need to have a contingency plan for that.
[00:15:42.147 --> 00:15:43.568]  We need to be prepared for that.
[00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:52.014]  Which, what that scenario describes is being prepared to control popular dissent is what they need to be prepared for.
[00:15:52.114 --> 00:15:57.357]  Because the government's fully hijacked by foreign banks and doing everything opposite of the Constitution or the will of the people.
[00:15:58.238 --> 00:16:01.400]  And expanding on that, they also said get ready for mass graves.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.723]  Well, you know, the Daily Newscaster has done a lot of stories about how Congress
[00:16:07.538 --> 00:16:14.182]  And appointed officials and elected officials are doing exactly the opposite of what the people want.
[00:16:14.302 --> 00:16:19.686]  In polls, people will say 80-90% they're against particular financial bailouts.
[00:16:20.106 --> 00:16:23.408]  They'll say in polls, there was a recent CNN poll, 96% out of over 1,200,000 respondents
[00:16:28.743 --> 00:16:33.524]  said we believe the Second Amendment gives us the right to carry a firearm.
[00:16:33.564 --> 00:16:34.945]  It's a personal individual right.
[00:16:34.985 --> 00:16:37.045]  That's 96% of the population.
[00:16:37.565 --> 00:16:43.907]  But when you get into the controlled press, you get into the corporate media, that's not the message that you hear.
[00:16:43.967 --> 00:16:47.628]  You hear a message that's funded by outside sources.
[00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:53.570]  I agree with you and we see that in poll after poll.
[00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:01.614]  We know the military covertly has been preparing for martial law for decades, preparing for gun confiscation.
[00:17:01.694 --> 00:17:11.762]  Now it's all on record with the Army Times coming out and Northcom announcing that they'll remove the governors under new orders and a new million-person civilian army that Obama called for.
[00:17:12.162 --> 00:17:17.747]  The Army has now signed the directive, Defense Department Directive 1404,
[00:17:20.714 --> 00:17:20.914]  1-0.
[00:17:21.454 --> 00:17:21.654]  That's 14,004.
[00:17:21.955 --> 00:17:23.975]  That's 14,004.10.
[00:17:24.655 --> 00:17:27.936]  I mean, it's all happening.
[00:17:29.657 --> 00:17:33.118]  This is a more organized takeover than even what we saw with Hitler or Lenin.
[00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:37.179]  Can you speak to that?
[00:17:37.219 --> 00:17:41.100]  The entire battle formation we see forming against us.
[00:17:41.687 --> 00:17:45.971]  Well, you know, I am just very concerned about the existence of NORTHCOM.
[00:17:46.811 --> 00:17:49.294]  NORTHCOM should not exist.
[00:17:49.374 --> 00:17:56.200]  The fact that it exists, that if people want a smoking gun, that there is martial law already, that it has been implemented.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.962]  NORTHCOM, just go to their website.
[00:17:59.082 --> 00:17:59.803]  That's the proof.
[00:18:00.423 --> 00:18:01.924]  Because what is martial law?
[00:18:02.065 --> 00:18:05.327]  It is not necessarily a hot shootout on the streets.
[00:18:05.948 --> 00:18:08.150]  Martial law is a system of government.
[00:18:08.704 --> 00:18:11.987]  It's an administrative command and control process.
[00:18:13.228 --> 00:18:21.335]  Well, if that's the case, then we're experiencing martial law right now, and you don't need to go any further than NORTHCOM to find out where it's being administered from.
[00:18:21.395 --> 00:18:26.038]  Martial law is extrajudicial outside the regular government elected by the people.
[00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:30.762]  It is ruled by a military form of government for an elite, and that's exactly what NORTHCOM is.
[00:18:32.083 --> 00:18:33.765]  To a T, it should not exist.
[00:18:35.556 --> 00:18:43.242]  In the 80s, when I was in the military, we had serious discussions about issues like this.
[00:18:43.966 --> 00:18:49.807]  And we would have been abhorred, just totally opposed to such an organization even existing.
[00:18:50.027 --> 00:18:50.647]  Well, that's right.
[00:18:51.508 --> 00:19:07.871]  In the World War I, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and it started changing in the late 80s, everybody was sat down and explained, you don't follow an order to take guns, you don't follow an order to put people in camps, you don't follow orders for this, and now it's the opposite.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:17.764]  It was explained because the chain of command is so critical and so important and people are trained to follow that chain of command without a lot of thought.
[00:19:18.144 --> 00:19:26.568]  However, they also drill into you that if you follow an illegal order, you will be punished by the UCMJ.
[00:19:27.628 --> 00:19:33.771]  They taught us that the Nuremberg Trials proved that I did it because I was ordered to was not a defense.
[00:19:37.571 --> 00:19:50.701]  When we come back, I want to talk about your friends and family and people that are still in the military, who have gotten out, where they stand, what percentage you think of the Republic, the people under arms, will defend the Republic, and how you see this playing out.
[00:19:50.802 --> 00:19:56.426]  More on the mass graves that they're preparing and the rest of it, the incinerators, according to the Rocky Mountain News.
[00:19:56.906 --> 00:19:58.708]  And then your phone calls throughout the hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:58.728 --> 00:20:00.389]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:20:08.979 --> 00:20:10.962]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:20:11.563 --> 00:20:14.046]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:20:14.627 --> 00:20:18.793]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:20:19.562 --> 00:20:21.302]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:20:21.662 --> 00:20:24.683]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:20:25.063 --> 00:20:28.064]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[00:20:28.364 --> 00:20:39.746]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds and survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[00:20:40.147 --> 00:20:46.568]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee, and tobacco.
[00:20:47.008 --> 00:20:51.471]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:52.652]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:16.685 --> 00:21:17.546]  Who is the enemy?
[00:21:18.046 --> 00:21:18.567]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:18.847 --> 00:21:19.828]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:19.848 --> 00:21:21.209]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:21.229 --> 00:21:22.851]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:23.211 --> 00:21:29.977]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:30.357 --> 00:21:30.798]  Some U.S.
[00:21:30.858 --> 00:21:36.503]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:37.183 --> 00:21:40.704]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:41.065 --> 00:21:50.928]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:51.168 --> 00:21:51.909]  Fabled enemies.

[00:22:00.132 --> 00:22:03.513]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:08.772 --> 00:22:09.812]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:10.212 --> 00:22:15.694]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:16.254 --> 00:22:16.754]  That's right.
[00:22:17.074 --> 00:22:19.355]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:19.915 --> 00:22:26.877]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:27.417 --> 00:22:35.039]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:35.535 --> 00:22:40.398]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:41.018 --> 00:22:44.180]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:50.964]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:51.344 --> 00:22:51.605]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.625 --> 00:22:53.546]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:22:53.606 --> 00:22:53.906]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:54.486]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:06.917 --> 00:23:10.159]  What are you going to do if your family has no food in the event of an emergency?
[00:23:10.379 --> 00:23:13.381]  Do you really want to find out and gamble with your family's lives?
[00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:16.183]  Order a one-year supply that will feed four to five people for only $39.95.
[00:23:16.243 --> 00:23:19.745]  That's right, a one-year supply for under $4,000 from YourFoodStorage.com.
[00:23:25.966 --> 00:23:39.758]  Are taxes, food, energy, housing, medical, forcing Americans into poverty?
[00:23:39.898 --> 00:23:45.803]  Is free enterprise flawed or is our monetary system forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:23:45.943 --> 00:23:48.385]  The answers are in Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:23:48.465 --> 00:23:51.908]  Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about the Fed and central banking.
[00:23:52.068 --> 00:23:52.889]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:52.929 --> 00:23:53.610]  I will give a U.S.
[00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.613]  silver dollar to everyone who purchases this book.
[00:23:55.714 --> 00:23:57.757]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:58.257 --> 00:24:00.080]  It's critical to be made aware of the system.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.041]  Get your copy today.
[00:24:01.061 --> 00:24:01.101]  800-686-2237.
[00:24:01.122 --> 00:24:01.302]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:25.489 --> 00:24:26.249]  Deadlines!
[00:24:26.309 --> 00:24:28.170]  We are back live!
[00:24:51.428 --> 00:24:53.650]  You know, we're not running against the wind, though, against this tyranny.
[00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:54.490]  We don't have a choice.
[00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.052]  And tyranny always outrages the people.
[00:24:57.092 --> 00:24:58.594]  It always starts collapsing.
[00:24:59.674 --> 00:25:00.815]  And so it's gonna collapse.
[00:25:01.676 --> 00:25:04.458]  The criminals can't help themselves but to steal everything they didn't nail down.
[00:25:04.478 --> 00:25:05.699]  And then some.
[00:25:07.721 --> 00:25:10.282]  And so this is the job we've got to do.
[00:25:11.363 --> 00:25:20.811]  Continuing, talking to military people you know, talking to folks, you know, as a reporter, talking to people that are still in the military or have gotten out.
[00:25:21.892 --> 00:25:25.894]  What percentage of people would you say are awake, and what's their view on what's going on?
[00:25:25.914 --> 00:25:34.298]  Because now, it is becoming mainstream knowledge that martial law pretty much is already in place, and that it's just being ratcheted down and nailed down right now.
[00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:42.542]  I'll answer your question, Alex, but first, before I came on, I heard you talking about keeping a taser or something in your car.
[00:25:43.223 --> 00:25:43.443]  Yes.
[00:25:43.643 --> 00:25:46.804]  You know, the best thing to keep in your car are road flares.
[00:25:48.445 --> 00:25:49.766]  Great multi-purpose tool.
[00:25:53.266 --> 00:26:03.589]  Anyways, basically what I think's happening with most people that are in the military, whether they're retired or current active duty, you know, they're aware of what's going on.
[00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:10.872]  It's a difficult situation because they're not necessarily involved in all the things that we discuss or write about.
[00:26:10.892 --> 00:26:16.613]  You know, they'll be involved in things that are completely normal and acceptable to them.
[00:26:17.214 --> 00:26:21.555]  So from their point of view, it's not like they're doing something bad or evil against the country.
[00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.532]  That's the first thing people really have to understand.
[00:26:24.552 --> 00:26:33.080]  Because I think a lot of people want to criticize our armed services personnel a little too quickly without really knowing their situation.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.943]  Well, I mean, most of the propaganda isn't even focused on the public.
[00:26:35.983 --> 00:26:41.688]  It's about slowly twisting the police, slowly twisting the military, slowly conditioning them.
[00:26:41.708 --> 00:26:44.511]  You know, we talked Sunday about the example of
[00:26:45.856 --> 00:26:55.702]  Now they would have EOD, Ordnance Disposal, Explosives Disposal people as the first liaisons with local police, because that sounded reasonable.
[00:26:56.083 --> 00:26:58.204]  Next it's, hey, we'll help you in warrant service.
[00:26:58.244 --> 00:27:00.045]  And I have the documents, they do that covertly.
[00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:02.026]  The Army and also the Marines.
[00:27:02.106 --> 00:27:03.888]  It's highly illegal, but it's going on.
[00:27:04.868 --> 00:27:09.711]  So they get them into this slowly and they test and see what'll work on the troops.
[00:27:10.372 --> 00:27:15.275]  Well, what you're talking about are all symptoms of the administration of martial law.
[00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:17.862]  That's how martial law is administered.
[00:27:18.283 --> 00:27:19.644]  What do people think they're seeing?
[00:27:21.485 --> 00:27:24.147]  You're just literally pointing out how martial law works.
[00:27:24.227 --> 00:27:33.734]  It's not people, you know, a lot of people want to envision something that comes out of a Hollywood movie or, you know, the worst part of World War II and pre-World War II.
[00:27:34.435 --> 00:27:36.076]  It doesn't even have to get to that point.
[00:27:36.116 --> 00:27:38.038]  You can live under a velvet glove.
[00:27:38.698 --> 00:27:41.020]  And I think we're under the velvet glove right now.
[00:27:43.129 --> 00:27:49.052]  But as people riot and things break down by design, the velvet starts to rip around the iron fist.
[00:27:49.672 --> 00:27:54.354]  Well, you know, that's my great concern because that's the crux of it, isn't it?
[00:27:56.195 --> 00:27:59.416]  How and if and when do things go to the next level?
[00:27:59.936 --> 00:28:01.177]  And who controls that?
[00:28:01.237 --> 00:28:04.999]  Whether they control the act or they control the propaganda, you know?
[00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:09.003]  You talk about founding fathers.
[00:28:09.043 --> 00:28:10.985]  You look at someone like Samuel Adams.
[00:28:11.406 --> 00:28:15.610]  He's someone that knew when a nexus in history happened.
[00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.472]  For example, like the Boston Massacre.
[00:28:18.193 --> 00:28:24.359]  It was Samuel Adams that took that information and turned it into a propaganda victory for the patriots.
[00:28:26.109 --> 00:28:30.890]  Those points happen, it's real critical to be able to control the outcome of that event.
[00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.830]  And that is what I'm concerned about, because I'm not sure what that event could be.
[00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:36.991]  There are some possibilities out there.
[00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:44.152]  I'm actually doing some research on, some historical research on the Detroit riots from, I can't remember if it was 67 or 68.
[00:28:45.552 --> 00:28:54.974]  And the reason I'm looking into that, I'm going to write more about that on the Daily Newscaster later this week, is because an event, here's what happened in I believe the summer of 67.
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:02.644]  There were some people, some US citizens, enjoying unlicensed beverages on private property.
[00:29:03.805 --> 00:29:10.229]  The state enforcement agents came to that location and a melee ensued after that point.
[00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:15.173]  Well, it grew into what was referred to by the press as a riot.
[00:29:15.813 --> 00:29:24.519]  But basically what we had is we had private individuals that weren't harming anyone, minding their own business, and they were harassed by the state.
[00:29:25.313 --> 00:29:29.137]  And then that was turned into an incident to take down, to declare martial law.
[00:29:29.777 --> 00:29:31.619]  Because that's precisely what happened that day.
[00:29:34.722 --> 00:29:37.164]  Let's talk more about that when we get back with our guest D.H.
[00:29:37.184 --> 00:29:39.086]  Williams, writer for the Daily Newscaster.
[00:29:39.527 --> 00:29:40.127]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:40.167 --> 00:29:43.030]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:50.337]  We'll come back and get more into how this could unfold and how we win the Info War against the globalists who are our mortal enemies.
[00:29:57.463 --> 00:30:00.446]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:30:00.466 --> 00:30:04.149]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.612 --> 00:30:16.360]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.304]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:30:21.684 --> 00:30:22.585]  The KDF dual
[00:30:22.585 --> 00:30:32.847]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:30:33.187 --> 00:30:38.729]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:30:38.969 --> 00:30:45.030]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.870]  What about you?
[00:30:46.271 --> 00:30:50.992]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.

[00:31:07.243 --> 00:31:12.687]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:31:12.967 --> 00:31:14.268]  And we knew what to do.
[00:31:14.288 --> 00:31:16.049]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:31:16.289 --> 00:31:21.313]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[00:31:21.772 --> 00:31:22.673]  to tell their story.
[00:31:23.293 --> 00:31:31.878]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:31:32.218 --> 00:31:39.022]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:31:39.322 --> 00:31:42.383]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:31:42.483 --> 00:31:47.686]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:31:48.247 --> 00:31:50.788]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:31:51.326 --> 00:31:57.172]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:31:57.373 --> 00:31:59.915]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:32:00.296 --> 00:32:05.201]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:32:06.855 --> 00:32:11.118]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:32:11.378 --> 00:32:16.281]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:17.801]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:32:17.981 --> 00:32:21.443]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.551]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[00:32:41.774 --> 00:32:42.715]  No animal testing.
[00:32:42.955 --> 00:32:44.275]  I use them and love them.
[00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:45.896]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.
[00:32:46.176 --> 00:32:47.237]  And I say big time.
[00:32:47.597 --> 00:32:48.817]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:32:48.837 --> 00:32:49.037]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[00:33:21.898 --> 00:33:25.299]  Some folks are born made to wait to fly.
[00:33:25.859 --> 00:33:29.340]  Ooh, the red, white, and blue.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.500]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:33:32.401 --> 00:33:39.422]  And when the band plays, hell to the chief, Lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[00:33:39.462 --> 00:33:43.383]  Tell them that it ain't me.
[00:33:43.984 --> 00:33:44.824]  It ain't me.
[00:33:46.596 --> 00:33:53.622]  D. H. Williams, we're going to go back to him in a moment and start opening the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:53.662 --> 00:33:58.365]  Before we go back to our guest, I do want to encourage listeners to not wait.
[00:33:58.966 --> 00:34:00.427]  The info war is key.
[00:34:00.447 --> 00:34:01.388]  We're about to get into that.
[00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:07.733]  The Congress has an 11% approval rating.
[00:34:07.753 --> 00:34:12.076]  The only person that has a high approval rating is Barack Obama because he's seen as an outsider because of the color of his skin.
[00:34:12.457 --> 00:34:13.878]  It's a branding bait and switch.
[00:34:15.538 --> 00:34:18.500]  It's a very cruel hoax that the establishment has played.
[00:34:20.181 --> 00:34:24.663]  We absolutely have to expose that he's controlled by the same people that George Bush was controlled by.
[00:34:25.664 --> 00:34:27.845]  And that's what the Obama Deception gets into.
[00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:30.807]  The website is theobamadeception.net.
[00:34:31.347 --> 00:34:32.528]  You can pre-order the DVD.
[00:34:32.588 --> 00:34:33.768]  It's going to ship out March 15th.
[00:34:33.828 --> 00:34:35.809]  It will also be available at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.432]  And the orders go out in the order they're received.
[00:34:39.472 --> 00:34:41.573]  So the first ones that will be shipped out will be those that pre-ordered
[00:34:42.293 --> 00:34:46.755]  Coming up on March 15th, so get your order in at Infowars.com for the Obama Deception.
[00:34:46.775 --> 00:34:53.898]  The other films we're carrying currently, like all the films I've made, Endgame, Terror Storm, Truth Rising, Fabled Enemies that Burma's produced under our label.
[00:34:55.819 --> 00:34:58.420]  Of course, Eye of the Phoenix, great new film out.
[00:35:00.521 --> 00:35:01.682]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:02.382 --> 00:35:08.085]  We've, by the way, redesigned and expanded the Obama Deception, and it is the Obama Deception
[00:35:10.497 --> 00:35:15.306]  We already had a great site up there, but it's even been expanded and redesigned, so be sure and go check out the obamadeception.net.
[00:35:15.707 --> 00:35:22.298]  Speaking of sponsors, I want to tell you about Survival Seed Bank.
[00:35:23.953 --> 00:35:31.576]  The great folks at Survival Seed Bank, in a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[00:35:32.016 --> 00:35:38.438]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims for example, when seeds had the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[00:35:38.478 --> 00:35:44.060]  There's a huge war on against non-hybrid seeds, waged by the global elite, who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:50.142]  Governments are storing seeds, the UN is storing seeds, globalists of every stripe are storing seeds near the Arctic Circle in these seed banks.
[00:35:50.962 --> 00:35:51.822]  Why do you think this is?
[00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:52.763]  You know why?
[00:35:52.843 --> 00:35:53.643]  Control and power.
[00:35:54.284 --> 00:35:59.866]  Solutions from science is trying to get seeds out of the globalist hands of the hands of the people, one seed bank at a time, one family at a time.
[00:36:00.707 --> 00:36:02.147]  So check out survivalseedbank.com.
[00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:06.769]  Alright, going back to D. H. Williams, we were talking about propaganda.
[00:36:06.789 --> 00:36:08.509]  People think of propaganda in a bad connotation.
[00:36:28.202 --> 00:36:35.660]  Propaganda just means putting out information that is positive to your political view or your military view or your economic view.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.242]  Black propaganda, you know, is lying or setting your enemy up or telling lies.
[00:36:42.642 --> 00:36:45.603]  So that is what we think of as normal propaganda, black propaganda.
[00:36:46.543 --> 00:36:47.344]  But it was wrong.
[00:36:47.364 --> 00:36:52.225]  The British were going around confiscating guns and raping people and stealing and pillaging and ignoring the legislatures.
[00:36:53.166 --> 00:37:03.209]  And the founders, for more than a decade, with pamphlets printed off little printing presses, being arrested, being beat up, going through hell on earth, they exposed what was going on and
[00:37:05.717 --> 00:37:12.299]  Remember, folks, you know, lost at, what was it, Lexington, but won at Concord.
[00:37:12.659 --> 00:37:14.439]  The whole point was, is the war was on.
[00:37:14.859 --> 00:37:30.083]  We want to avert that, but I have to tell you, the globalists are so unpopular that if it does become physical, I don't see them being successful unless they can stage riots through economic calamity, where the public, if I got people rioting in my neighborhood, I'd almost want the military there, but see, then that sets the precedent.
[00:37:30.343 --> 00:37:33.264]  So this is how they craft and stage all of this,
[00:37:33.784 --> 00:37:37.688]  Where it can be rolled out, and that's how I see it being done, or a biological release.
[00:37:38.068 --> 00:37:41.931]  More terror attacks, I see that coming off the back burner to the forward burner.
[00:37:42.812 --> 00:37:43.753]  Speak about that, D.H.
[00:37:43.793 --> 00:37:44.113]  Williams.
[00:37:44.734 --> 00:37:50.579]  You know, Samuel Adams once said that you put your enemy in the wrong and you keep them there.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.701]  He understood how to turn a phrase.
[00:37:53.761 --> 00:37:56.604]  He understood how to get a message out.
[00:37:56.624 --> 00:37:58.946]  Propaganda, a lot of people they want to say it's good or bad.
[00:37:59.086 --> 00:38:01.268]  It's neither, it doesn't really, it depends on how it's used.
[00:38:02.678 --> 00:38:22.278]  But the reason I brought that up is it's so important that open media, what I call the new mainstream media, radio shows like yourself, various websites, there's video simulcast on the web, the internet's becoming television now, there's a lot of different sources because it's going to be critical if you study history.
[00:38:22.807 --> 00:38:26.368]  It's going to be critical to control the information as events happen.
[00:38:26.708 --> 00:38:32.710]  And that's why they're moving, the New York Times admitting, to shut down the web as we know it, force all our sites off.
[00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:39.553]  That's why people shouldn't just use the web, they should do that, but also use on the ground copies of DVDs, pamphlets, meetings.
[00:38:39.593 --> 00:38:42.734]  We need to have on the ground and build that infrastructure now.
[00:38:43.376 --> 00:38:48.600]  Yeah, they need to use the meet-ups that were used so great, so well during the last presidential campaign.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.962]  You know, people need to get out and meet their neighbors.
[00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:53.884]  You know, we're the ten people on their street, do they know them by name?
[00:38:54.364 --> 00:38:58.367]  You know, you don't have to get in their business, you can just introduce yourself and say hello.
[00:38:59.408 --> 00:39:01.749]  You know, we need to break free from our television.
[00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:07.914]  You know, I know that's something that I've done almost completely, because frankly, it's hard to watch
[00:39:08.638 --> 00:39:19.082]  The media that is funded and controlled by large foundations with very specific interests, and they literally, they're openly infotainment.
[00:39:19.122 --> 00:39:24.063]  The news stations openly claim now to be in the infotainment business.
[00:39:24.684 --> 00:39:31.006]  They don't even claim to be journalists, or to have integrity, or to be objective, or to even bring you the comprehensive news.
[00:39:31.046 --> 00:39:33.807]  They don't even claim to do that, so why do we expect them to?
[00:39:34.278 --> 00:39:36.960]  Well, the Pentagon's funding tens of billions in fake news.
[00:39:37.381 --> 00:39:38.782]  Every federal agency is.
[00:39:38.842 --> 00:39:41.864]  I mean, that's why the mainstream media is in free fall right now.
[00:39:42.425 --> 00:39:49.591]  Wow, I read that 46 million, excuse me, 46 billion the Pentagon's going to spend on improving their image.
[00:39:50.952 --> 00:39:56.657]  You know, I'm still trying to find that website to apply to because, you know, I want some of that 46 billion.
[00:39:57.497 --> 00:40:01.561]  But joking aside, I mean, that should tell people right there that
[00:40:01.963 --> 00:40:06.084]  The information they're getting is created.
[00:40:06.184 --> 00:40:11.246]  That's a giant war chest of brainwashing and payoffs.
[00:40:11.966 --> 00:40:12.806]  It really is.
[00:40:13.206 --> 00:40:16.927]  And you have to understand that this is what they do.
[00:40:16.987 --> 00:40:18.248]  This is not mystical.
[00:40:18.308 --> 00:40:19.308]  It's not magical.
[00:40:19.388 --> 00:40:22.049]  It's not something that, oh, our government wouldn't do it.
[00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:24.510]  Again, go to Fort Bragg right there.
[00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.070]  What do you have?
[00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:28.831]  You have the 4th Special Psychological Operations Battalion.
[00:40:29.855 --> 00:40:31.155]  Okay, it's right in your face.
[00:40:31.436 --> 00:40:39.298]  On their crest, their motto is Verbum Vincet, which is Latin for the word conquers.
[00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:45.100]  Absolutely, and they say the main battlefield is the human mind.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:52.502]  It really is, and again, I know you talk about, I've heard your show in the past, and you've brought up
[00:40:53.032 --> 00:41:01.699]  What the founders did, what Samuel Adams and his crew did in Boston in, you know, late 1750s all the way up into the 1770s.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.602]  And what they did was they wrote in newspapers.
[00:41:06.522 --> 00:41:07.723]  They put out pamphlets.
[00:41:07.783 --> 00:41:12.027]  Newspapers then were basically just one piece, you know, a one-piece document.
[00:41:12.047 --> 00:41:13.668]  Some raw sheet.
[00:41:13.808 --> 00:41:18.352]  Yeah, but they wrote constantly, usually under different pen names, although everyone knew who they were.
[00:41:19.072 --> 00:41:21.734]  They had meetings with different groups constantly.
[00:41:24.237 --> 00:41:28.720]  When things happened, they controlled the press around those events.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.463]  Well, let's be clear, there were more Tory pro-Empire papers, but people learned that was a bunch of bull.
[00:41:34.723 --> 00:41:36.524]  Oh, there were more Tories.
[00:41:36.544 --> 00:41:45.368]  Another thing people misunderstand about the colonial days, the pre-revolutionary days, is there were no Americans in the colonies.
[00:41:45.808 --> 00:41:47.229]  There were only British subjects.
[00:41:47.749 --> 00:41:52.912]  Most of them, their greatest desire was to become wealthy and return to England.
[00:41:54.388 --> 00:41:56.270]  Not to stay and build a new country.
[00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.372]  That really wasn't, for most people, it was not their objective.
[00:41:59.793 --> 00:42:02.415]  So the Patriots were fighting an uphill battle.
[00:42:02.835 --> 00:42:06.558]  The Tories were, you know, the majority of the population.
[00:42:06.598 --> 00:42:11.241]  Particularly when the wind would blow that way, you know, more of the population would go that way.
[00:42:11.722 --> 00:42:18.267]  You know, later as the Patriots looked like they had an opportunity to win, you know, they had more converts, of course.
[00:42:20.902 --> 00:42:31.248]  Beautifully said, and they were committed, and they weren't going to back down, and the arrogance of the establishment is what in the end brought them down.
[00:42:31.268 --> 00:42:34.169]  The British had never been defeated up until that time.
[00:42:34.629 --> 00:42:40.953]  The globalists, I see them in a weaker position than the British were here in the colonies, because the people were British.
[00:42:41.393 --> 00:42:42.694]  Over 80% were Tory.
[00:42:43.814 --> 00:42:44.775]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:42:44.815 --> 00:42:48.717]  I mean, that's the real unknown story of that time period.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:53.164]  This was a revolt of British citizens against the British King.
[00:42:54.145 --> 00:42:55.687]  This was not Americans fighting.
[00:42:55.707 --> 00:42:57.910]  This was not a foreign war.
[00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.512]  This was an internal battle.
[00:42:59.572 --> 00:43:03.477]  This was an internal revolution.
[00:43:04.578 --> 00:43:07.983]  We're in a much better position now than those folks were.
[00:43:08.322 --> 00:43:11.503]  Well, I've studied Greek revolutions, Roman revolutions, countless others.
[00:43:11.523 --> 00:43:12.843]  There's very few that are legitimate.
[00:43:13.463 --> 00:43:18.705]  Our revolution was, not perfect, but was the greatest example ever, because they wanted to make George Washington king.
[00:43:18.745 --> 00:43:23.906]  He said no, and after two terms, he said, I'm going back to my farm to grow hemp and tobacco, and he left.
[00:43:25.786 --> 00:43:27.267]  I mean, these really were amazing people.
[00:43:27.327 --> 00:43:31.208]  He set the stage for that.
[00:43:31.268 --> 00:43:35.589]  I mean, you know, there was a time, and I can't recall the story perfectly.
[00:43:37.623 --> 00:43:45.389]  If someone wants to read a great book, I would recommend... It slipped my mind.
[00:43:45.429 --> 00:43:46.831]  I'll think of it in a moment.
[00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:54.497]  But, you know, there was a time when General Washington's soldiers, when his officers, wanted to revolt.
[00:43:54.537 --> 00:43:55.978]  They wanted to take over the government.
[00:43:56.698 --> 00:44:01.122]  And he had a speech, a talk with them in a small... I can't remember if it was a school room or a church.
[00:44:01.222 --> 00:44:03.344]  Usually they were both used for the same purposes.
[00:44:04.102 --> 00:44:16.478]  and uh... a very sensitive personal speech and uh... after the speech they had changed their mind you know if it wasn't for george washington we would probably have ended up with you know another king immediately after the revolution
[00:44:18.664 --> 00:44:19.345]  Absolutely.
[00:44:20.606 --> 00:44:22.628]  That's why they love to demonize the Founding Fathers.
[00:44:23.209 --> 00:44:37.945]  I mean, to have this group of historians come out and say, Abraham Lincoln was a much greater person than George Washington, as they've been announcing on the news the last two days, that is, just for anyone who knows history, so insulting to your intelligence.
[00:44:39.534 --> 00:44:41.215]  Well, most people aren't going to study history.
[00:44:41.235 --> 00:44:42.275]  It takes a lot of work.
[00:44:42.975 --> 00:44:47.457]  The Men Who Started the American Revolution, that's the name of the book, by A.J.
[00:44:47.938 --> 00:44:48.438]  Langeth.
[00:44:49.178 --> 00:44:51.079]  The Men Who Started the American Revolution.
[00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:51.699]  Great book.
[00:44:52.219 --> 00:45:00.963]  It's a history from, it starts around 1757 and takes you into the formation of the winning of the revolution.
[00:45:01.003 --> 00:45:01.703]  It's a great book.
[00:45:02.584 --> 00:45:05.725]  Everything the Founding Fathers did was heavily documented.
[00:45:06.611 --> 00:45:07.972]  They wrote in papers.
[00:45:08.112 --> 00:45:09.892]  They wrote letters to each other.
[00:45:10.392 --> 00:45:11.973]  People wrote about them.
[00:45:12.293 --> 00:45:19.035]  We know virtually everything about them, but yet very little of that information bubbles up into pop culture.
[00:45:19.575 --> 00:45:29.259]  You know, one of the things that always strikes me as odd is if you mention Samuel Adams to some people, the first thing they'll associate it with is beer.
[00:45:30.519 --> 00:45:33.560]  When in reality, he never brewed any beer.
[00:45:34.272 --> 00:45:36.334]  You know, his father was a maltster.
[00:45:36.394 --> 00:45:37.154]  He made malt.
[00:45:37.194 --> 00:45:38.976]  He sold it to people who brewed beer.
[00:45:39.496 --> 00:45:42.418]  Samuel inherited that money upon his father's death.
[00:45:43.239 --> 00:45:45.781]  Not caring about money, he was a bad money manager.
[00:45:46.101 --> 00:45:52.666]  He loaned half the money to a friend, never to be seen again, and then he mismanaged and spent the other half.
[00:45:52.867 --> 00:45:55.969]  His time was spent fermenting revolution.
[00:45:56.409 --> 00:45:58.311]  That's what he was passionate about.
[00:45:58.611 --> 00:46:01.573]  His job, matter of fact, he was the British tax collector for Boston.
[00:46:02.774 --> 00:46:03.455]  He didn't make beer.
[00:46:05.848 --> 00:46:06.469]  Absolutely.
[00:46:06.649 --> 00:46:07.810]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:21.160]  They'll be all over the map, but going back to people you talked to and engaging what's going on in the military, I mean, they can see outside the compartmentalization.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:27.124]  Now it's announced, meaning when they start announcing they're getting ready for physical martial law, that means they're considering engaging it.
[00:46:27.905 --> 00:46:29.906]  They wouldn't uncloak their operation if they weren't.
[00:46:30.166 --> 00:46:30.827]  Can you speak to that?
[00:46:31.636 --> 00:46:33.457]  Well, not really the specifics.
[00:46:33.677 --> 00:46:35.018]  I don't know what's in their mind.
[00:46:35.078 --> 00:46:37.459]  I'm not privy to the inside plans.
[00:46:37.539 --> 00:46:42.782]  I'm just seeing it form from the outside, doing the analysis, putting the pieces together.
[00:46:42.802 --> 00:46:46.345]  I can tell you that all levels, from young
[00:46:47.686 --> 00:46:56.734]  Enlisted personnel, to senior NCOs, to officers, know something is wrong, even if they're not familiar with all the information.
[00:46:56.754 --> 00:47:03.200]  They know when they're in Iraq, you know, guarding a cement factory that doesn't make cement, that something's wrong.
[00:47:06.342 --> 00:47:08.384]  So, they all know something's wrong.
[00:47:08.584 --> 00:47:11.447]  Where that's going to lead to, I know that's the answer you're looking for.
[00:47:11.467 --> 00:47:12.388]  I don't know.
[00:47:14.658 --> 00:47:21.020]  I think what's important is that we're aware of what's happening and that we try to influence where things are going to go to.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:27.462]  And I think people need to really get out there and while we have the opportunities, push the information out there.
[00:47:27.542 --> 00:47:36.205]  If you're a municipal official and you're involved in these meetings, start sharing the information, make YouTube videos, get in touch with different websites.
[00:47:36.245 --> 00:47:36.665]  That's right!
[00:47:37.498 --> 00:47:41.501]  We need to be in the fight, and people want some tailored, exact blueprint.
[00:47:41.541 --> 00:47:42.802]  Folks, use your own mind.
[00:47:43.203 --> 00:47:44.864]  Targets of opportunity in the info war.
[00:47:45.865 --> 00:47:47.546]  Don't sit on the fence, folks.
[00:47:47.566 --> 00:47:48.767]  That's where you're going to get run over.
[00:47:49.128 --> 00:47:50.649]  You need to be in the fight.
[00:47:50.789 --> 00:47:51.490]  Get in the fight.
[00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:52.751]  Continue with how we get in the fight.
[00:47:53.711 --> 00:47:57.895]  Well, I think the way we do that is first is you get out and you support people who are already doing it.
[00:47:58.725 --> 00:48:01.826]  If you can, buy the movies.
[00:48:01.886 --> 00:48:06.346]  I've actually just recently found some of your movies on Google.
[00:48:06.366 --> 00:48:09.067]  I wasn't aware that you've done so many documentaries.
[00:48:10.767 --> 00:48:11.907]  Some really interesting stuff.
[00:48:11.967 --> 00:48:18.269]  It's a side subject, but something really interesting happened while I was watching one of your movies the other night.
[00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:21.169]  Get active.
[00:48:21.209 --> 00:48:23.410]  Get out and get involved on the street level.
[00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:24.430]  I mean, just do something.
[00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:25.730]  You don't have to have a degree.
[00:48:26.314 --> 00:48:33.638]  You don't have to have any special knowledge or experience if you have desire, because you'll learn everything that you need to do.
[00:48:34.119 --> 00:48:35.219]  So please get out there.
[00:48:35.259 --> 00:48:37.461]  You can support us at the Daily Newscaster.
[00:48:37.501 --> 00:48:40.262]  This is a money-losing venture.
[00:48:40.322 --> 00:48:42.764]  We do this because we want to get the information out.
[00:48:43.604 --> 00:48:52.190]  You know, I've been reading and studying open source information, doing some analysis, trying to come up with an idea of the direction it's going.
[00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:54.651]  You know, I don't have the inside answer.
[00:48:54.691 --> 00:48:55.972]  I don't know if anyone does.
[00:48:56.485 --> 00:49:01.928]  But you can get an idea of how events are materializing.
[00:49:02.048 --> 00:49:04.649]  No, I agree, and forecasting that.
[00:49:04.669 --> 00:49:05.629]  But you picked my interest.
[00:49:05.649 --> 00:49:07.170]  What happened when you were watching one of the films?
[00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:14.553]  Well, I found a film, and I apologize if I can't remember everything because I didn't get to watch the whole film.
[00:49:15.154 --> 00:49:18.895]  I believe it was called Exposing Bohemian Grove.
[00:49:18.915 --> 00:49:21.076]  Yeah, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:49:21.116 --> 00:49:22.337]  Dark Secrets, yes.
[00:49:23.117 --> 00:49:24.738]  Well, I was at the segment
[00:49:26.471 --> 00:49:29.193]  Where they're having the ceremony called the Cremation of Care.
[00:49:29.754 --> 00:49:35.518]  Very elaborate ceremony in the Redwood Forest, the beautiful Redwood Forest.
[00:49:36.479 --> 00:49:45.725]  And my relative was here who has a five-year theological degree, has a Master's in Divinity, where he's basically a religious historian.
[00:49:45.745 --> 00:49:50.929]  He studied religions and really knows them from a historical perspective.
[00:49:51.707 --> 00:49:53.869]  Well, he just came by for a brief moment.
[00:49:53.909 --> 00:49:55.270]  He didn't have a lot of time.
[00:49:55.310 --> 00:50:03.076]  I was watching your video on my monitor, and I showed him about 40 seconds of that elaborate ceremony.
[00:50:03.796 --> 00:50:05.338]  He did not know where the video came from.
[00:50:05.378 --> 00:50:06.879]  He didn't know the context of it.
[00:50:07.339 --> 00:50:08.680]  He had never seen it before.
[00:50:09.621 --> 00:50:17.407]  I turned it off because he had to go, and he looked at me and he said, immediately, he said, you know, that is a druidic absolution ritual.
[00:50:18.568 --> 00:50:19.869]  It's very satanic.
[00:50:20.866 --> 00:50:22.087]  Where does that come from?
[00:50:24.908 --> 00:50:31.170]  And, you know, I told him a little bit about the background of where it was, and he was just floored by that information.
[00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:36.512]  Well, that's what Helmut Schmidt, the German Chancellor, in his book wrote.
[00:50:36.872 --> 00:50:41.514]  It is a druidic ritual by absolution, like we go to Christ to be washed in blood.
[00:50:41.954 --> 00:50:46.736]  It takes all the evil things they've done, they believe in karma, and it puts it off onto the child they kill.
[00:50:48.382 --> 00:50:58.312]  It's absolutely frightening and apparently it's a historical ritual that's, you know, like I said, my uncle has a five-year degree and is basically a religious historian and they picked it right up.
[00:50:58.732 --> 00:50:58.972]  Yeah.
[00:50:59.433 --> 00:51:03.497]  Well, we infiltrated July 15, 2000, the only people to do it.
[00:51:04.478 --> 00:51:06.359]  One other guy got some footage out, he's in prison right now.
[00:51:07.176 --> 00:51:16.924]  SouthSummit.com is the place for top name brand knives such as Kershaw, Spyderco, Cold Steel, Gerber, K-Bar, Boker, Leatherman, and more.
[00:51:17.084 --> 00:51:21.047]  South Summit has one of the largest selections of self-defense products on the web.
[00:51:21.188 --> 00:51:31.016]  Knives, stun guns, police batons, pepper spray, LED flashlights, emergency kits, binoculars, and tactical gear are just some of the great products found on SouthSummit.com.

[00:52:00.292 --> 00:52:02.554]  1-800-234-8654.
[00:52:02.634 --> 00:52:03.995]  That's 1-800-234-8654.
[00:52:04.075 --> 00:52:13.662]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:14.022 --> 00:52:15.764]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:16.658 --> 00:52:17.679]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:18.199 --> 00:52:18.700]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:19.961]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:19.981 --> 00:52:21.302]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:21.342 --> 00:52:23.023]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:23.363 --> 00:52:30.109]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:30.509 --> 00:52:30.949]  Some U.S.
[00:52:30.989 --> 00:52:36.674]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:37.334 --> 00:52:40.855]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:41.216 --> 00:52:43.636]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:07.156 --> 00:53:11.739]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:53:12.079 --> 00:53:19.264]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:53:19.504 --> 00:53:20.905]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:53:21.125 --> 00:53:25.028]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:53:25.288 --> 00:53:28.871]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:53:29.111 --> 00:53:33.153]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:53:37.076 --> 00:53:37.436]  I think so.
[00:54:18.649 --> 00:54:45.525]  I wish a buck was still silver It was back when the country was strong Back before Elvis And before the Vietnam War came along Before the Beatles and yesterday
[00:54:48.604 --> 00:54:51.165]  That's up to you, everybody out there!
[00:55:13.157 --> 00:55:20.020]  You know, I think about all the things, thanks to my family, people that work with me, my wife's support, that we've been able to do.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:24.522]  Sneaking into Bohemian Grove, getting death threats over it.
[00:55:25.262 --> 00:55:27.843]  Then Chris Jones got a job there and shot video.
[00:55:27.863 --> 00:55:30.945]  They came and arrested him, set him up, and said they were sending him to prison for it.
[00:55:31.685 --> 00:55:33.866]  He's in prison right now in California.
[00:55:35.587 --> 00:55:37.808]  I mean, people that do this get killed and go to prison.
[00:55:39.468 --> 00:55:44.950]  And thank God I'm prominent so the enemy doesn't want to move against me, but I have no illusions that they might do it.
[00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:49.892]  And I just hope that they imprison me or set me up or kill me that folks won't feel sorry for me.
[00:55:49.932 --> 00:55:51.853]  They'll realize that I did it willingly.
[00:55:52.513 --> 00:55:55.494]  I don't want it taken away that I lose if I'm killed or imprisoned.
[00:55:56.534 --> 00:55:57.775]  No, I did this willingly.
[00:55:57.875 --> 00:55:59.075]  I knew what I was getting into.
[00:55:59.936 --> 00:56:04.937]  And it's the tree of liberty is nourished by the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[00:56:05.378 --> 00:56:06.258]  I don't want that to happen.
[00:56:06.278 --> 00:56:07.118]  I have a lot of work to do.
[00:56:07.418 --> 00:56:08.359]  That's in God's hands.
[00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:13.428]  But you have to get past the fear if you're going to affect any real change.
[00:56:13.448 --> 00:56:16.949]  Before we go to some calls, I'm going to keep you a little bit in the next hour if you can do it, Doug Williams.
[00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:19.550]  Any comments on commitment?
[00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:23.251]  People think that it's courage to fight evil.
[00:56:23.771 --> 00:56:27.193]  It would take blind, mindless courage to know what's going on and to not fight it.
[00:56:28.053 --> 00:56:32.355]  In my experience, bullies have to be stood up against, and especially people this sick.
[00:56:33.075 --> 00:56:34.596]  I mean, my instincts are to fight them.
[00:56:34.676 --> 00:56:35.636]  I can't help myself.
[00:56:36.056 --> 00:56:39.758]  It doesn't matter how much they threaten me or what they do, I can't help it.
[00:56:39.838 --> 00:56:40.958]  I have to do what I do.
[00:56:41.518 --> 00:56:43.699]  Your take on that, or your view?
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.040]  It's an absolute impulse.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.281]  I'm doing it impulsively as well.
[00:56:50.102 --> 00:56:52.183]  It's not something I even take pleasure in.
[00:56:53.103 --> 00:56:55.744]  There are many times that I wish I wasn't doing it.
[00:56:56.508 --> 00:56:59.649]  I get tired of uncovering the information.
[00:57:00.969 --> 00:57:09.091]  Give an example, the latest gun control efforts, the gun grabbing that's going on, the way they're doing it.
[00:57:09.291 --> 00:57:14.513]  It is so difficult for me to digest that I have not actually been able to write much about it.
[00:57:15.953 --> 00:57:18.114]  So I would rather be doing something else.
[00:57:18.254 --> 00:57:23.415]  I would rather be disproving all this and being right about it, but that's...
[00:57:23.911 --> 00:57:25.712]  Just, you know, that's just not the truth.
[00:57:25.792 --> 00:57:31.814]  You know, I have to be true to myself, and the information's real.
[00:57:31.854 --> 00:57:33.095]  So now what do we do about it?
[00:57:33.475 --> 00:57:35.136]  Well, here's what I want to do about it.
[00:57:35.216 --> 00:57:52.183]  I want to find a peaceful resolution, a peaceful way to turn the tide, because, you know, a lot of people like to call themselves revolutionaries, and we're part of the revolution, and identify with the patriots in the early revolution, but we're actually the counter-revolutionaries here.
[00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:57.305]  We want things to go back the way they're supposed to be.
[00:57:57.705 --> 00:58:00.928]  Not even back, we just want them to be the way they're supposed to be now.
[00:58:01.828 --> 00:58:18.279]  Go back to the rule of law where everyone follows the same system of justice, where justice can be applied equally, where individual liberty is the highest calling, not state government and federal control.
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:20.381]  Yeah, for a lot of people,
[00:58:21.621 --> 00:58:22.261]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:54.321]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.141 --> 00:58:58.722]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:58.842 --> 00:59:03.463]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:03.583 --> 00:59:06.343]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[00:59:06.543 --> 00:59:09.404]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:09.584 --> 00:59:14.305]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:14.525 --> 00:59:15.465]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:15.665 --> 00:59:18.587]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:18.907 --> 00:59:25.790]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:29.031]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:29.171 --> 00:59:29.431]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:31.852 --> 00:59:34.093]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:59:44.336 --> 00:59:45.576]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:45.616 --> 00:59:46.276]  Take action today.
[00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:48.137]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:59.838 --> 01:00:01.739]  Waging War on Corruption.
[01:00:02.219 --> 01:00:05.181]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:15.366 --> 01:00:24.771]  The globalists create the crisis and then they say to the public, set up a world government and we can end this destructive conflict and have an age of peace.
[01:00:25.151 --> 01:00:27.492]  We will have peace?
[01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:29.253]  Oh, yes.
[01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:31.402]  Alright, D.H.
[01:00:31.482 --> 01:00:32.322]  Williams is our guest.
[01:00:32.342 --> 01:00:33.783]  We're going to your phone calls all over the map.
[01:00:34.104 --> 01:00:36.085]  Patriot, Walter, Mike, Osborne, Greg.
[01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:38.126]  Patriot in Wisconsin.
[01:00:38.407 --> 01:00:40.228]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:00:40.248 --> 01:00:42.169]  Uh, hi Alex.
[01:00:42.189 --> 01:00:45.972]  I guess I don't need to change topics, but um... We're all over the map.
[01:00:46.032 --> 01:00:46.932]  Any topic's fine.
[01:00:47.673 --> 01:00:49.314]  You were talking about religion yesterday?
[01:00:49.334 --> 01:00:49.394]  Yes.
[01:00:50.455 --> 01:00:59.101]  I want to know if you know anything about the, like the secular humanists or any of these other atheist groups, because last summer
[01:00:59.542 --> 01:01:05.586]  I was at a humanist conference in Washington, D.C., and I basically went there to learn about them.
[01:01:06.567 --> 01:01:20.497]  And it turns out they're very much... well, actually, the Humanist Manifesto is explicitly socialist, and everybody at the conference, they were talking about the United Nations and the U.N.'
[01:01:20.477 --> 01:01:24.540]  's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and they were very much globalist.
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.261]  Are you on a speakerphone?
[01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:32.201]  Uh, I'm in a kind of a hallway that's echoing, so... Okay, I just, uh, look.
[01:01:32.742 --> 01:01:33.362]  That's the thing.
[01:01:34.102 --> 01:01:43.268]  In all cases, I've found that the leaders of secular humanists, the leaders of the eugenics movement, they're all the same, the transhumanists.
[01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:53.075]  They're always for world government, they're always for the scientific man engineered by them, they're always control freaks, and they're always involved in the occult.
[01:01:53.855 --> 01:02:04.126]  And to their lower minions, they say the occult doesn't exist, or God doesn't exist, but they are trying to keep them in the dark, so that's what the occult is.
[01:02:04.186 --> 01:02:04.987]  It means secrecy.
[01:02:05.308 --> 01:02:06.309]  It's compartmentalized.
[01:02:06.449 --> 01:02:08.711]  The symbol is a pyramid.
[01:02:09.412 --> 01:02:20.401]  And so, yeah, it's all UN, global government, and then those very humanist websites write articles about me saying Jones is insane, world government doesn't exist.
[01:02:21.021 --> 01:02:23.183]  Meanwhile, you go to their meetings, that's what they're pushing.
[01:02:23.643 --> 01:02:33.792]  It's, they revel, see I revel in waking people up, unlocking minds, you know, letting people expand their horizons, you know, freeing them and then, you know, once the process is done, they're on their own.
[01:02:35.148 --> 01:02:39.135]  But there are other people who learn about the New World Order who are power-hungry.
[01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:44.524]  You know, the term satanic, we think of a guy in a red suit, you know, with human sacrifice, but really...
[01:02:46.034 --> 01:02:47.876]  It's about dominating innocence.
[01:02:48.276 --> 01:02:49.517]  That's why they sacrifice a baby.
[01:02:49.577 --> 01:02:51.739]  It's about going past their human instincts.
[01:02:51.799 --> 01:02:53.901]  It's about getting into evil.
[01:02:54.541 --> 01:03:01.007]  It's about controlling others, lying to others, screwing others, tying others down, dominating others.
[01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:11.455]  It is just really, really control freak, wicked, weak, weak, weak people who only seek after power.
[01:03:12.096 --> 01:03:14.238]  You want to comment on that, Mr. Williams?
[01:03:15.236 --> 01:03:25.522]  Well, you know, it's scary how many people that lack empathy and have compulsions that seem to rise to the top.
[01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:33.026]  You see that a lot in law enforcement and clergy as well.
[01:03:33.066 --> 01:03:44.613]  It seems people who have, you know, that have moral chaos, internal moral chaos, tend to seek positions of power where they can hold morality over others.
[01:03:45.471 --> 01:03:47.892]  It's just, it's a scary situation.
[01:03:48.433 --> 01:03:53.795]  And I will say this, growing up, you know, all of us swerve into the dark side and experience it in life.
[01:03:53.835 --> 01:03:58.077]  At least most of us, I think, ever, who are conscious, we know they have, everybody does.
[01:03:59.158 --> 01:04:04.960]  The engine of evil, the engine of darkness is incredibly weak.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:09.362]  It's just willing to cheat and lie and steal so it has an ace in the hole.
[01:04:10.743 --> 01:04:19.426]  In my experience, I would be much more concerned about someone who has passion and love and empathy because those are people who have unlimited internal power.
[01:04:19.826 --> 01:04:22.187]  And so the Satanists are looking for power.
[01:04:22.467 --> 01:04:24.848]  They never knew the real power is in love and honor.
[01:04:24.868 --> 01:04:26.169]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:28.349]  Oh, I absolutely do.
[01:04:28.449 --> 01:04:32.451]  All foundations, all relationships are based on the foundation of trust.
[01:04:32.971 --> 01:04:35.872]  Once you destroy that trust, you've destroyed that relationship.
[01:04:35.932 --> 01:04:38.173]  It doesn't matter if it's between you and your grocer.
[01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:43.685]  You and your employees, you and your wife, you and your children, it's all based on trust.
[01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:49.147]  And how can you have trust if you've got, you know, if you're harming somebody, if you're being deceptive?
[01:04:49.767 --> 01:04:55.429]  And that's why they love to corner the weak, the meek, the small, the innocent, and they just love tearing them to pieces.
[01:04:56.609 --> 01:05:00.431]  Well, I don't love fighting the enemy, but I will put them down.
[01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:02.011]  And that is my goal.
[01:05:02.451 --> 01:05:03.272]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:03.372 --> 01:05:04.892]  Thank you, Patriot Wisconsin.
[01:05:05.152 --> 01:05:06.873]  Walter and others, your call, straight ahead.
[01:05:09.412 --> 01:05:13.457]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[01:05:13.917 --> 01:05:16.881]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.
[01:05:17.281 --> 01:05:21.786]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, and I've been solving tax debt problems for 30 years, and I can help you too.
[01:05:22.147 --> 01:05:26.772]  We can stabilize IRS collection action and get your tax debt reduced, sometimes completely eliminated.
[01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:38.846]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[01:05:39.146 --> 01:05:41.990]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.

[01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:48.692]  That's 800-34-N-O-T-A-X.
[01:05:49.012 --> 01:05:51.793]  Or go to my website at TaxHelpOnline.com.
[01:05:52.133 --> 01:05:56.975]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades, and he can help you.
[01:05:57.435 --> 01:05:58.175]  Call us today, 800-346-6829.
[01:05:58.415 --> 01:05:58.795]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:06:06.946 --> 01:06:13.310]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:13.691 --> 01:06:15.672]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:16.332 --> 01:06:17.353]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:17.893 --> 01:06:18.414]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:19.494]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:19.514 --> 01:06:21.035]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:21.055 --> 01:06:22.717]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:23.057 --> 01:06:29.801]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:30.202 --> 01:06:30.642]  Some U.S.
[01:06:30.682 --> 01:06:36.326]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:37.006 --> 01:06:40.529]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:43.311]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:07.062 --> 01:07:14.270]  Yourfoodstorage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest-priced, highest-quality, storable food for over a decade.
[01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:18.615]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds 4 to 5 people is only $39.95.
[01:07:18.715 --> 01:07:23.661]  That's right, a one-year supply that feeds 4 to 5 people for under $4,000.
[01:07:27.534 --> 01:07:28.054]  We're good to go.
[01:07:45.489 --> 01:07:48.611]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.243 --> 01:08:24.144]  We have 52 minutes left in this transmission.
[01:08:24.164 --> 01:08:26.505]  We've got a reporter for the DailyNewscaster.com.
[01:08:27.205 --> 01:08:29.165]  Doug Williams with us, taking your phone calls.
[01:08:29.646 --> 01:08:32.146]  Walter in Connecticut, skull and bones country.
[01:08:32.546 --> 01:08:33.707]  You're on the air, Walter.
[01:08:33.747 --> 01:08:34.547]  Thanks for calling.
[01:08:36.548 --> 01:08:37.288]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:08:37.648 --> 01:08:38.268]  Can you hear me?
[01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:39.068]  Yes, I can.
[01:08:39.108 --> 01:08:39.829]  Loud and clear.
[01:08:39.909 --> 01:08:40.949]  Great show.
[01:08:42.209 --> 01:08:49.371]  I'd like to talk about putting some teeth in this Tenth Amendment resolutions that are going around now.
[01:08:51.682 --> 01:09:06.167]  I'm the founder of the Committees of Safety, and we're working closely with Dr. Edwin Vieira on reclaiming these two ancient powers, the power of the purse and the power of the sword.
[01:09:06.407 --> 01:09:06.927]  That's a no!
[01:09:06.947 --> 01:09:13.589]  Before I forget, tell Joey, Dr. Edwin Vieira, we've had him on before, he's in the computer, Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[01:09:13.989 --> 01:09:16.190]  Before I forget, I want Dr. Edwin Vieira back on.
[01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:23.276]  Yes, we just had a Committee of Safety meeting in Connecticut last month with Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[01:09:23.837 --> 01:09:25.859]  We had a few state legislators there.
[01:09:25.879 --> 01:09:30.003]  That's right, we had him on a few months ago about this state's rates issue.
[01:09:30.043 --> 01:09:33.747]  Yeah, it was a great show, Alex.
[01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:36.690]  We have it up on our website, that interview with you.
[01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.971]  Oh, give out the website.
[01:09:38.732 --> 01:09:40.073]  It's committeesofsafety.org.
[01:09:41.391 --> 01:10:08.819]  And what we're doing, we're writing, with Edwin's help, statutes to reclaim these two ancient powers, the power of the purse, which Edwin wrote the template for up in New Hampshire, the sound money bills, and there's at least four states now that have implemented those sound money bills, like Indiana, I think Colorado, there's a number of them that are doing that, and we're also
[01:10:09.332 --> 01:10:22.924]  We're going to be writing the statutes to revitalize the constitutional state militia, and the structure will be from the bottom up, and the officers and everything.
[01:10:23.505 --> 01:10:31.812]  But that's what the Committees of Safety are focusing on, those two ancient powers that need to be reclaimed by we the people.
[01:10:32.293 --> 01:10:32.813]  Absolutely.
[01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:34.435]  Let's get Mr. Williams' comment on that.
[01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:38.077]  Wow, that's some really great work that you're doing there.
[01:10:38.118 --> 01:10:41.066]  I mean, that is what we're supposed to be doing.
[01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:54.921]  You know, that's really why I put the uniform on in the very beginning was because I believed in, not in symbols, not in authorities, but in a document called the United States Constitution and the Civil Rights, the first 10 amendments.
[01:10:54.981 --> 01:11:01.006]  And if we don't exercise these powers, if we don't make them real in our daily lives, they die.
[01:11:01.347 --> 01:11:01.827]  They stay.
[01:11:01.867 --> 01:11:03.408]  Well, then that's what's been happening.
[01:11:03.448 --> 01:11:07.091]  And so what you're doing, sir, is fantastic.
[01:11:07.151 --> 01:11:08.793]  I mean, that is what's going to turn the tide.
[01:11:10.526 --> 01:11:12.006]  Yeah, it's like muscles.
[01:11:12.786 --> 01:11:28.070]  The first time you go speak at city council about an issue, the first time you call into a talk show, the first time you set up a website, the first time you decide to make a film, just believe in yourself and know that it's so exciting that if the people just move, that it's an unstoppable force.
[01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:29.210]  Anything else, Collar?
[01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:34.891]  What we're going to be doing is doing a massive petition drive to
[01:11:36.603 --> 01:11:46.627]  To put the state legislators to sponsor these bills and get that power behind it.
[01:11:46.967 --> 01:11:50.489]  Well, this is the animating contest of liberty, folks.
[01:11:50.529 --> 01:11:54.650]  And the reason so many of you feel like you're dead is because you're not in the animated contest for liberty.
[01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:56.451]  There's always a contest for liberty.
[01:11:56.711 --> 01:12:02.873]  There's always thugs and crooks and slimeballs and groups that want to use you and control you and suck off of you and make you a slave.
[01:12:03.153 --> 01:12:04.774]  So I want folks in Connecticut and in the
[01:12:04.974 --> 01:12:05.654]  Thank you.
[01:12:05.674 --> 01:12:08.855]  It's committeesofsafety.org and now we have members in all 50 states.
[01:12:08.895 --> 01:12:09.615]  I'm excited about it.
[01:12:09.675 --> 01:12:11.035]  I think we can really win this battle.
[01:12:11.075 --> 01:12:11.376]  Well done.
[01:12:11.396 --> 01:12:13.216]  I appreciate everything you're doing, Alex.
[01:12:35.805 --> 01:12:36.726]  Hello and good day Mr. Jones.
[01:12:36.746 --> 01:12:41.708]  I wanted to ask you if it's possible to print some t-shirts with sheep on them.
[01:13:06.073 --> 01:13:13.736]  And write a comment like, we don't need no sheeple, and link to Infowars.com.
[01:13:14.736 --> 01:13:20.939]  Sure, we're actually coming out with a t-shirt that shows a whole bunch of sheep on it, and they're all saying Obama, Obama.
[01:13:21.639 --> 01:13:29.842]  But yeah, I mean, whatever, just folks, I mean, a lot of people put Infowars.com on shirts, and there's hundreds of sites, not just ours, selling shirts that say it, and I'm all for it.
[01:13:29.882 --> 01:13:30.903]  It's all about the Infowar.
[01:13:31.703 --> 01:13:34.584]  Okay, so it's a good idea to spread this word.
[01:13:35.925 --> 01:13:36.385]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:36.586 --> 01:13:41.069]  Are you a European immigrant, a recent European immigrant to Australia?
[01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:44.412]  No, I'm not from Australia.
[01:13:44.432 --> 01:13:45.493]  I'm from Austria.
[01:13:45.633 --> 01:13:46.333]  Oh, you know what?
[01:13:46.393 --> 01:13:46.814]  You know what?
[01:13:47.454 --> 01:13:48.335]  You know, that's what I thought.
[01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:53.259]  Yeah, they put on my screen Australia, and it's Austria.
[01:13:53.339 --> 01:13:54.560]  So I apologize.
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:55.401]  They got that wrong.
[01:13:56.542 --> 01:13:57.022]  I thought so.
[01:13:57.082 --> 01:13:58.503]  So how are things going over?
[01:13:58.543 --> 01:13:59.804]  Can I ask a second question?
[01:14:00.385 --> 01:14:00.845]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:14:03.227 --> 01:14:04.168]  I wanted to ask you,
[01:14:04.778 --> 01:14:13.024]  Because of the new world order, it really is a new world order, a world wide shield if you can say so.
[01:14:14.364 --> 01:14:19.588]  What I'm interested in is, is it really one family or one force?
[01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:25.892]  Or are there more people and trying to fight with each other?
[01:14:27.856 --> 01:14:31.321]  Is it a game that's already over?
[01:14:31.582 --> 01:14:32.663]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[01:14:33.785 --> 01:14:35.307]  Have you ever seen the movie The Godfather?
[01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:39.653]  Yes, I think so.
[01:14:39.673 --> 01:14:41.336]  Godfather 1 with Marlon Brando.
[01:14:43.966 --> 01:14:47.047]  I think I've seen it, but I can't remember.
[01:14:47.107 --> 01:14:49.387]  I mean, that's a composite of real things that happen.
[01:14:49.807 --> 01:14:50.987]  They just changed the names.
[01:14:51.127 --> 01:14:52.528]  Mario Puzo's on record with that.
[01:14:53.308 --> 01:14:55.388]  You know, the singer's really Frank Sinatra and things like that.
[01:14:56.108 --> 01:15:03.770]  Notice how you've got these 12 families meeting at a commission meeting in the big boardroom, and they kill each other.
[01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:05.190]  They have wars occasionally.
[01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:08.971]  They're jockeying for power, but they're all intermarried in the same group.
[01:15:11.909 --> 01:15:23.652]  They have commission meetings once a year to decide things, you know, to fix disputes, but they keep the rackets going, the prostitution, the drug dealing, you know, the gambling on the sheeple.
[01:15:25.012 --> 01:15:33.314]  So they have their fights, but overall they have their rackets and their systems and their scams, and that's what Bilderberg Trilateral Commission, CFR, is.
[01:15:33.874 --> 01:15:35.015]  That's what they're doing.
[01:15:35.835 --> 01:15:39.596]  And I've studied the makeup of the New World Order.
[01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:46.312]  You have a bunch of British and German royal family elites that are, you know, control the Dutch royal family as well.
[01:15:46.733 --> 01:15:50.295]  They're intermarried with the Rothschilds, so it's indistinguishable.
[01:15:51.235 --> 01:15:56.058]  And there's some new money like Bill Gates and others out there, but they're low-level compared to these people.
[01:15:56.098 --> 01:15:59.340]  And yes, they control and dominate much of the world.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:02.222]  They're mopping up a few, quote, rogue nations right now.
[01:16:03.162 --> 01:16:07.605]  And they... Let's get Mr. Williams' comment on that from our caller from Austria.
[01:16:08.666 --> 01:16:08.986]  Go ahead.
[01:16:09.645 --> 01:16:10.706]  Well, what do you want me to answer?
[01:16:10.746 --> 01:16:12.367]  What the New World Order looks like?
[01:16:12.587 --> 01:16:14.289]  I mean, it's make-up from your research.
[01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:21.995]  Well, you know, gosh, it seems to be precisely what you say it is.
[01:16:22.595 --> 01:16:25.377]  I mean, it's something that's been going on for hundreds of years.
[01:16:25.497 --> 01:16:27.699]  It's an administration.
[01:16:27.739 --> 01:16:36.205]  If people have a hard time visualizing what it is, it's a system of administration controlled by special interests.
[01:16:36.646 --> 01:16:39.428]  Those special interests happen to be the moneyed elite.
[01:16:40.266 --> 01:16:49.593]  Um, that have political control and military control and economic controls and kind of put, you know, force their will upon us.
[01:16:51.926 --> 01:16:53.606]  Yeah, that's the nature of power in history.
[01:16:53.626 --> 01:16:55.187]  This is a very sinister elite.
[01:16:56.427 --> 01:17:06.128]  And as David Rockefeller said, you know, they want a world government for the administrative convenience of international bankers, which is better than the auto-determination of nation-states in the past.
[01:17:06.148 --> 01:17:08.889]  I mean, that's a butchering of his quote, but it's very close.
[01:17:08.909 --> 01:17:19.111]  I mean, they're on record saying this, and now they've imploded the world market, and they're saying the answer is a new global bank that rules every nation and controls everything we do.
[01:17:19.131 --> 01:17:20.191]  I mean, we're here.
[01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:22.592]  These are plans.
[01:17:22.632 --> 01:17:26.834]  These people make plans for long periods of time to control things.
[01:17:26.854 --> 01:17:31.356]  They have nothing but time and money to make plans.
[01:17:31.437 --> 01:17:33.818]  People should not be surprised that they're doing this.
[01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:43.383]  It always cracks me up when someone says, well, that intricate plan, that information you're talking about, that sounds like a conspiracy because I don't understand it.
[01:17:44.083 --> 01:17:45.524]  Well, what is a conspiracy?
[01:17:45.604 --> 01:17:46.965]  It's two or more people.
[01:17:47.857 --> 01:17:51.618]  privately and secretly hatching an illegal act.
[01:17:52.498 --> 01:17:54.919]  So should we be surprised that this is going on?
[01:17:54.959 --> 01:17:55.619]  I don't think so.
[01:17:57.219 --> 01:17:57.779]  Absolutely.
[01:17:57.819 --> 01:18:01.140]  Does that answer your question, Mike, from Austria?
[01:18:02.961 --> 01:18:03.801]  Yes, of course.
[01:18:04.061 --> 01:18:15.864]  I think it's really a shame that so many people in Europe and in America are not aware of this behind-the-scenes government and people should
[01:18:17.491 --> 01:18:18.897]  uh... noticed that uh...
[01:18:20.919 --> 01:18:23.260]  Well, that's the key weakness for the New World Order.
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:24.281]  It's also their strength.
[01:18:24.641 --> 01:18:44.853]  As long as we're looking at Tony Blair or Gordon Brown, or as long as we're looking at Merkel or Sarkozy, as long as we're focused on Benjamin Netanyahu, we never get past them to the bureaucracy controlled by the big money power, these interlocking corporations and banks.
[01:18:45.273 --> 01:18:47.474]  And so, politicians can come and go.
[01:18:47.514 --> 01:18:49.476]  We can expose a politician as a liar and bad.
[01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:51.898]  Well, I think that's exactly right.
[01:18:51.938 --> 01:18:53.059]  That trick is breaking down.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:15.040]  It's working on some.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:32.903]  The people that it works on are people who don't really read a lot, people that don't go to the internet for their news, look at, you know, alternative sources, or not even alternative, but just world sources, like The Guardian, or Haratz, or even Al Jazeera English can be a good source.
[01:19:33.163 --> 01:19:33.924]  Russia Today.
[01:19:33.944 --> 01:19:41.805]  You've got to go out and you've got to look at some different sources, pull the information together, compare them, and say, you know, what's really happening here?
[01:19:43.059 --> 01:19:44.781]  Yeah.
[01:19:44.861 --> 01:19:53.207]  And then as you study news over the years, you get a larger global model and have more data, and then you can understand what they're doing, understand their agenda.
[01:19:54.448 --> 01:19:59.171]  If you want to figure that out, just go rent the movie Three Days of the Condor with Robert Redford.
[01:19:59.191 --> 01:20:01.553]  He's an analyst for the CIA.
[01:20:01.593 --> 01:20:02.794]  That's what he does for a living.
[01:20:03.294 --> 01:20:04.075]  You know what, Mr. Williams?
[01:20:04.095 --> 01:20:04.735]  Let's do some more.
[01:20:04.775 --> 01:20:05.656]  Let's take some more calls.
[01:20:05.916 --> 01:20:06.337]  Stay with us.
[01:20:07.119 --> 01:20:09.381]  Right now the world is a scary place.
[01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:14.806]  It's only a matter of time until we are struck again, but this time with biological and chemical attacks.
[01:20:15.046 --> 01:20:19.429]  The thought is scary, but it's important to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[01:20:19.630 --> 01:20:22.332]  The First Line Defense Kit allows you to do just that.
[01:20:22.512 --> 01:20:32.303]  The first line of defense kit includes Nutri-Immune and Nutri-Defense, providing top biological host defenses against pathogen entry, and provides immune NK killer cell boosting.
[01:20:32.503 --> 01:20:41.013]  Also included, the Nano-Mask Nano-Particular antiviral masks with replacement filters, providing supreme viral protection from airborne pathogens.
[01:20:41.313 --> 01:20:42.935]  And, the first line of defense wipes,
[01:20:43.095 --> 01:20:43.395]  I think so.
[01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:15.313]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:21:15.333 --> 01:21:16.935]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:21:17.055 --> 01:21:19.859]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:21:19.919 --> 01:21:23.584]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:21:33.219 --> 01:21:38.092]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:21:41.872 --> 01:21:42.973]  How dare you?
[01:21:44.315 --> 01:21:49.359]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:21:49.379 --> 01:21:52.022]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:21:52.102 --> 01:21:58.488]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:24:13.556 --> 01:24:40.710]  I read the news today, oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad Well, I just had to laugh I saw the photograph
[01:24:44.611 --> 01:24:47.673]  He blew his mind out in a car.
[01:24:50.775 --> 01:24:54.958]  He didn't notice that the lights had changed.
[01:24:55.738 --> 01:24:57.820]  All right, we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.481]  Gonna have our guests with us about 40 after them.
[01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:03.783]  But they're a big news blitz of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:25:04.104 --> 01:25:06.045]  Still taking your phone calls till the end of the transmission.
[01:25:07.266 --> 01:25:08.847]  Mike in Austria was still holding.
[01:25:08.867 --> 01:25:09.827]  He had something else he wanted to say.
[01:25:09.867 --> 01:25:10.748]  Are you done, Mike?
[01:25:10.768 --> 01:25:11.829]  Any other questions or comments?
[01:25:12.847 --> 01:25:18.890]  Yes, I have another comment because the world government is telling you what they are doing.
[01:25:19.050 --> 01:25:22.572]  You just have to read between the lines.
[01:25:22.792 --> 01:25:31.417]  If you look in Western media, they are all under one line.
[01:25:32.018 --> 01:25:35.239]  And if you read between the lines, they tell you what they will do.
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:41.643]  So and also like to advise you Americans to be
[01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:42.570]  A little
[01:26:01.135 --> 01:26:03.736]  And they can kill you if they like.
[01:26:04.276 --> 01:26:05.616]  Well, that's the cost of liberty.
[01:26:05.636 --> 01:26:07.857]  No guts, no glory, but you're right.
[01:26:08.417 --> 01:26:11.278]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:26:11.918 --> 01:26:13.139]  Osborne in Missouri.
[01:26:13.159 --> 01:26:13.719]  You're on the air.
[01:26:14.259 --> 01:26:15.740]  Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:16.320]  Hi.
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:17.120]  Good afternoon.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.541]  Yeah, I just had a quick, I guess, question.
[01:26:22.201 --> 01:26:30.224]  It seems like, Alex, I know you don't like to talk about this movement being culminated in any kind of armed conflict, and I know I would hate to see it go to that level.
[01:26:30.737 --> 01:26:32.719]  I actually watched the movie, The Patriot, the other day.
[01:26:32.739 --> 01:26:33.760]  I know you've spoken about it.
[01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:39.306]  And, uh, I hear a lot of people talking and identifying with the sentiments of the Founding Fathers and such.
[01:26:39.706 --> 01:26:42.990]  It seemed like the Colonel Army, they did have good luck with the British.
[01:26:43.450 --> 01:26:45.312]  It seemed like they had comparable weapons.
[01:26:45.432 --> 01:26:47.895]  The mortars, the musket, if you will.
[01:26:48.635 --> 01:26:54.081]  Nowadays, we might have a pretty well-armed civilian squad, if you will, but, you know, we don't have
[01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:56.090]  Let's just stop right there.
[01:26:56.110 --> 01:27:02.873]  Number one, the colonial army and the militias had a better long rifle that could shoot further with better accuracy.
[01:27:02.933 --> 01:27:04.353]  The British were just...
[01:27:14.156 --> 01:27:40.180]  trained to aim with their muskets and shoot you know in large formations blasting each other but they three four five in some battles ten eleven twelve times the numbers of the uh... rebels you know of our ancestors and it was the willingness to keep fighting keep resisting and guerrilla warfare and remember the military many people are on our side it's a info war it's a propaganda war
[01:27:41.525 --> 01:27:47.307]  If they're able to roll out their police state through riots that are staged to make it look good in phase one, then they're going to have success.
[01:27:47.347 --> 01:27:51.269]  It's the info war, the info war, the info war.
[01:27:51.309 --> 01:27:52.049]  I mean, let's get real.
[01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:59.452]  If things got to the physical level, other people just have to have a battle plan in mind that, you know, well, six months into something,
[01:27:59.972 --> 01:28:04.035]  You know, those helicopters have to land, or these people have to go to bars at night.
[01:28:04.295 --> 01:28:05.136]  I mean, come on!
[01:28:05.696 --> 01:28:14.982]  If millions of gun owners actually decide, it'll be like moose hunting season, as Mark Kornke always says, where there's a lottery and only one out of ten people gets a moose license.
[01:28:15.302 --> 01:28:20.366]  I mean, if we had the will to actually go up against the military, we would trash them from one end to the other.
[01:28:20.666 --> 01:28:25.370]  We're not Iraqis who historically aren't the best shots in the field.
[01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:26.471]  I don't want that.
[01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:30.614]  I don't have some cojones need to, I can't wait to get a shooting war going.
[01:28:30.654 --> 01:28:37.060]  But just like the Patriot, which is based on a composite of true stories and real things that happened, burning folks up in churches, all of it.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:39.761]  People, the government's going to kill people's children.
[01:28:40.021 --> 01:28:41.762]  They're going to kill the wrong people's children.
[01:28:42.222 --> 01:28:42.542]  Okay?
[01:28:42.603 --> 01:28:44.283]  And then people are just going to go off.
[01:28:44.584 --> 01:28:49.386]  And then the feds are going to go into bunker mentality, and the local police, you're not going to see them on the road.
[01:28:49.406 --> 01:28:50.446]  This is cowardice.
[01:28:50.947 --> 01:28:52.688]  The New World Order's people are cowards.
[01:28:52.708 --> 01:28:54.989]  You want to comment on that, Mr. Williams?
[01:28:55.669 --> 01:29:00.631]  Yeah, I mean, I definitely agree with the back end of that about certain people being cowards.
[01:29:00.691 --> 01:29:01.552]  There's a lot of those.
[01:29:03.105 --> 01:29:04.306]  Here's what I see happening.
[01:29:04.346 --> 01:29:06.547]  Number one, I wouldn't advocate any kind of violence.
[01:29:06.567 --> 01:29:07.888]  This is an information war.
[01:29:08.388 --> 01:29:14.891]  Number two, if something happens, it's going to happen, it's going to be a small regional or localized incident.
[01:29:15.591 --> 01:29:16.992]  It's not going to be pretty.
[01:29:17.632 --> 01:29:18.733]  There could be casualties.
[01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:20.053]  There'll probably be casualties.
[01:29:20.754 --> 01:29:22.594]  And then the news of that event will travel.
[01:29:23.795 --> 01:29:30.158]  And then depending on how that news travels and the response to that news is going to determine what happens next.
[01:29:30.828 --> 01:29:37.651]  And that's the critical point where people of good conscience have to act and the right decisions have to be made.
[01:29:37.671 --> 01:29:42.573]  Because open conflict with the military or the police is not something I don't think anybody's advocating.
[01:29:43.833 --> 01:29:46.354]  Yeah, we want to have the police on our side.
[01:29:46.374 --> 01:29:47.835]  We want to have the military on our side.
[01:29:48.135 --> 01:29:53.037]  So when the globalists sample the mindset of their forces, they realize it's not their forces.
[01:29:53.297 --> 01:29:54.398]  There are forces.
[01:29:54.478 --> 01:29:55.118]  We the people.
[01:29:57.319 --> 01:29:58.239]  We're on the march.
[01:29:58.719 --> 01:30:00.220]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.249 --> 01:30:04.092]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:08.335 --> 01:30:09.537]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:30:09.857 --> 01:30:11.018]  eFoods does it again.
[01:30:11.238 --> 01:30:16.022]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with 3 days worth of healthy, delicious, easy fix food.
[01:30:16.343 --> 01:30:20.646]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[01:30:33.051 --> 01:30:33.371]  I don't know.
[01:30:47.995 --> 01:30:52.738]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:52.778 --> 01:30:55.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:17.730]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:18.251 --> 01:31:18.751]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:19.051 --> 01:31:20.032]  This is his M.O.
[01:31:20.052 --> 01:31:21.332]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:21.412 --> 01:31:23.033]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:23.413 --> 01:31:30.156]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:30.556 --> 01:31:30.996]  Some U.S.
[01:31:31.036 --> 01:31:36.679]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:37.379 --> 01:31:40.920]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:41.261 --> 01:31:51.124]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:31:51.364 --> 01:31:52.105]  Fabled enemies.

[01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:03.709]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:07.273 --> 01:32:10.896]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:32:10.976 --> 01:32:16.579]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:32:16.699 --> 01:32:20.762]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.

[01:33:19.826 --> 01:33:21.008]  Get up, stand up.
[01:33:26.610 --> 01:33:29.271]  Reality is reality.
[01:33:29.791 --> 01:33:30.572]  And we've studied it.
[01:33:30.592 --> 01:33:32.693]  I know what's going on.
[01:33:32.733 --> 01:33:34.273]  I have their own documents, their plans.
[01:33:34.954 --> 01:33:36.294]  All our predictions have come true.
[01:33:36.314 --> 01:33:38.275]  We've been accurate about where the world was going.
[01:33:38.295 --> 01:33:39.976]  It wasn't very hard.
[01:33:39.996 --> 01:33:44.018]  We were reading globalist on white papers on what they were setting up, what they were doing.
[01:33:44.438 --> 01:33:49.100]  These cameras, the cameras in the schools, the street corners, the whole grid is to control the population.
[01:33:51.516 --> 01:33:52.477]  This is illegitimate.
[01:33:52.497 --> 01:34:02.468]  This is a foreign offshore banking group openly bankrupting the country and enslaving us and wanting to use the military and police to oppress a legitimate political movement to rectify those problems.
[01:34:03.615 --> 01:34:07.816]  We are under martial law, as our guest, formerly with Special Forces and a reporter, is explaining to you.
[01:34:08.156 --> 01:34:08.737]  This is real.
[01:34:08.777 --> 01:34:09.757]  We're in martial law.
[01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:11.077]  It's what Richter scale.
[01:34:11.197 --> 01:34:18.259]  From 1 to 10, I wrote in 1998, that it was a 3.6 on the Richter scale.
[01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:19.320]  I wrote an article on that at home.
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:22.321]  It's martial law and it's a 3.6 on the Richter scale.
[01:34:22.681 --> 01:34:24.021]  We're now at about a 5 to a 6.
[01:34:25.161 --> 01:34:26.302]  And it doubles each time.
[01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:31.689]  I would say an eight and a half is troops on the streets, people being secretly arrested, the rest of it.
[01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:36.737]  A ten is what you had in Berlin with the fall of 1945.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:43.222]  You know, the choice is for you to make out there.
[01:34:43.542 --> 01:34:46.324]  Police, military, your whole future is being destroyed by these people.
[01:34:46.684 --> 01:34:48.085]  They're enslaving you and your family.
[01:34:48.145 --> 01:34:50.807]  You're in the boat with us, whether you know it or not.
[01:34:50.847 --> 01:34:55.570]  Whether you bought the mind game that you're with the establishment or you're compartmentalized and don't know.
[01:34:55.590 --> 01:35:00.453]  You know, but I have police and military call me and go, none of it made sense till now I heard you and I checked it out, it's true.
[01:35:01.034 --> 01:35:04.076]  You know, look, what we're telling you is the truth.
[01:35:04.636 --> 01:35:05.617]  As close as you're going to get to it.
[01:35:05.657 --> 01:35:06.417]  Am I infallible?
[01:35:06.437 --> 01:35:07.138]  Do I make mistakes?
[01:35:07.178 --> 01:35:10.220]  Yes, but frankly, it's much worse than we even say here on air.
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:12.640]  People accuse me of exaggerating.
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.681]  It's actually the opposite.
[01:35:19.522 --> 01:35:22.402]  So, I mean, that said, I want to take a few final calls with our guest.
[01:35:22.622 --> 01:35:25.623]  Any comments to what I was just saying there, Mr. Williams?
[01:35:25.643 --> 01:35:29.583]  Yes, listeners should not wait for an invitation to an internment camp.
[01:35:30.544 --> 01:35:35.144]  They're under the administrative control of a centralized government right now.
[01:35:36.385 --> 01:35:37.425]  So it's already happened.
[01:35:37.445 --> 01:35:38.705]  The whole country's a camp.
[01:35:39.931 --> 01:35:40.471]  Exactly.
[01:35:40.511 --> 01:35:42.012]  I mean, you're under surveillance.
[01:35:42.372 --> 01:35:45.333]  Look at the financials with the banking and the Patriot Act compliance.
[01:35:45.673 --> 01:35:46.834]  It's a total tracking grid.
[01:35:47.314 --> 01:35:48.214]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:48.274 --> 01:35:49.515]  I mean, it's here and it's now.
[01:35:49.955 --> 01:35:53.677]  So, I mean, we have to act now while we can before it is too late.
[01:35:53.857 --> 01:35:54.997]  I mean, it can be pushed back.
[01:35:55.097 --> 01:35:55.757]  It really can.
[01:35:55.777 --> 01:35:56.998]  I honestly believe that.
[01:35:57.498 --> 01:36:01.260]  But a lot of people are going to have to take action and really get involved.
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:03.981]  I mean, that's the whole reason I'm doing this.
[01:36:04.041 --> 01:36:05.701]  I would rather be doing something else.
[01:36:06.161 --> 01:36:07.402]  You know, I could be, you know,
[01:36:08.317 --> 01:36:11.322]  Believe me, it's not profitable running a website.
[01:36:12.665 --> 01:36:15.710]  So I could be doing something else, but right now this is what we need to be doing.
[01:36:16.274 --> 01:36:18.175]  Well, you need to make what you do profitable.
[01:36:18.215 --> 01:36:24.419]  That's one of the most important parts of this, is the enemy's somehow done a mind trick on us.
[01:36:24.439 --> 01:36:26.621]  We're not supposed to sell books or videos.
[01:36:26.641 --> 01:36:29.022]  I'm not saying you're saying this, but we're not supposed to be profitable.
[01:36:29.042 --> 01:36:30.243]  We're not supposed to be able to expand.
[01:36:30.263 --> 01:36:33.565]  We're supposed to be under a bridge yelling at passing cars.
[01:36:33.645 --> 01:36:33.865]  No.
[01:36:34.265 --> 01:36:35.766]  We need to take over the system.
[01:36:35.826 --> 01:36:37.848]  We need to expand what we're doing.
[01:36:37.868 --> 01:36:39.048]  We need to shoot high.
[01:36:39.088 --> 01:36:41.270]  We need to aim for huge goals.
[01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:46.333]  And by aiming high, we will have greater and greater successes and get to that goal.
[01:36:46.633 --> 01:36:50.036]  I mean, all I've seen is our success when we engage.
[01:36:51.537 --> 01:36:53.638]  That's absolutely, that's it.
[01:36:53.658 --> 01:36:54.199]  That's the key.
[01:36:54.219 --> 01:36:55.680]  That's what we need to do and you're right.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.301]  We, you know, get involved.
[01:36:57.361 --> 01:36:58.762]  Engage, engage, engage.
[01:37:00.883 --> 01:37:02.444]  Take a few final calls here for our guests.
[01:37:02.504 --> 01:37:03.845]  I'm doing a news blitz and more calls.
[01:37:03.865 --> 01:37:06.547]  Let's talk to Greg in Michigan.
[01:37:06.587 --> 01:37:07.428]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:37:09.249 --> 01:37:09.669]  Hi, Alex.
[01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:10.029]  How are you?
[01:37:11.738 --> 01:37:11.958]  Good.
[01:37:12.038 --> 01:37:24.453]  I want to first thank both of you for what you're doing and also want to let you know that I'm a new Planet TV subscriber.
[01:37:24.693 --> 01:37:27.296]  Thank you for the support.
[01:37:27.456 --> 01:37:29.599]  My question is about action.
[01:37:29.619 --> 01:37:31.481]  You guys were just talking about taking action.
[01:37:32.279 --> 01:37:43.103]  What happened to me, and what I find that most people are doing out there, is they're so caught up in their jobs and their everyday lives, trying to just get by, that they don't know what's going on.
[01:37:43.123 --> 01:37:43.884]  That's right.
[01:37:43.944 --> 01:37:45.885]  Poverty is a tool of control.
[01:37:45.925 --> 01:37:46.245]  Go ahead.
[01:37:47.265 --> 01:37:47.845]  Absolutely.
[01:37:48.526 --> 01:37:58.870]  So, and I went through a process of, first I was on the road in sales, and I was listening to NPR News, and that got me interested in independent media.
[01:37:59.528 --> 01:38:08.757]  And then from there was Dish Television Network, and it was Link TV on that, and Free Speech TV, and then eventually to your show.
[01:38:10.098 --> 01:38:22.729]  I think it's very, very important that we massively get the information out there as quickly as we possibly can to people that don't know anything that's going on, as I did at one time.
[01:38:22.810 --> 01:38:25.192]  Because now they're ready to hear the truth more than ever.
[01:38:26.201 --> 01:38:26.721]  I think so.
[01:38:27.361 --> 01:38:33.683]  With everything that's going on with the economy and stuff like that, people have doubts, and I think they're more open to listening to what is going on.
[01:38:34.343 --> 01:38:44.505]  But it's important to me to massively and quickly, mostly with people that I know, get the information to my friends, my family.
[01:38:44.525 --> 01:38:50.346]  I've got two granddaughters, and it's important to me that they get this information.
[01:38:50.486 --> 01:38:54.427]  My question for you is, what video
[01:38:55.265 --> 01:39:05.133]  In your opinion, and maybe your listener's opinion, is the one that will make the most impact on a one-shot chance with somebody to get them to look further into this?
[01:39:05.593 --> 01:39:07.675]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:39:09.556 --> 01:39:09.877]  Okay.
[01:39:11.398 --> 01:39:12.399]  That's what I needed to know.
[01:39:12.819 --> 01:39:16.282]  That's my film, but I'm saying it is the best over all of you.
[01:39:16.302 --> 01:39:20.105]  One of the films that impacted me the most was Loose Change.
[01:39:22.868 --> 01:39:24.795]  It's excellent, but it's on the 9-11 issue.
[01:39:26.929 --> 01:39:35.494]  And of course I produced the final cut, and it's a very important film, and that's a great one to kind of shatter people's paradigms and their illusions, so I agree with that as well.
[01:39:36.374 --> 01:39:52.144]  I believe, though, using the hype wave, we should use the fact that they've put everything on Obama to sell the public on the final takeover, that when the Obama deception comes out, people can pre-order it now at InfoWars.com, it comes out March 15th, that people go crazy with that.
[01:39:52.624 --> 01:39:53.624]  Think of the power
[01:39:54.905 --> 01:40:05.848]  of tens of thousands of people getting the DVD and buying a DVD burner and buying a hundred blanks and making a hundred copies and saying, man, this is a very interesting film.
[01:40:06.468 --> 01:40:07.548]  Tell me what you think about it.
[01:40:07.608 --> 01:40:08.588]  It's non-partisan.
[01:40:08.628 --> 01:40:09.569]  It's about Obama.
[01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:13.469]  And then they will, the film's really about how he's just a puppet.
[01:40:13.489 --> 01:40:16.450]  It's really about the banking system and the New World Order and the FEMA camps.
[01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:19.951]  I mean, really, and all showing how he's just a front man.
[01:40:21.051 --> 01:40:23.552]  But I think the Obama deception is going to
[01:40:24.542 --> 01:40:27.424]  Really be a powerful tool.
[01:40:27.485 --> 01:40:32.329]  I tell you what, your prison planet TV, Alex, just amazing.
[01:40:32.369 --> 01:40:44.299]  The studio, the professionalism, the quality of the production, having a guest live on that program and the video streaming on the Internet, having that video available for later viewing.
[01:40:44.679 --> 01:40:47.581]  That's an incredible, powerful media source.
[01:40:47.962 --> 01:40:53.046]  You know, and I think people like yourself are actually becoming the new mainstream media because of people are wanting
[01:40:54.105 --> 01:40:55.127]  Real information.
[01:40:55.147 --> 01:40:58.572]  You know, they're not going, they're not turning on their TV set anymore.
[01:40:59.358 --> 01:41:06.002]  But that's why they're moving to shut down the old web with net neutrality ending that, the taxation, the control.
[01:41:06.663 --> 01:41:08.784]  And then notice how they introduced net taxation.
[01:41:08.804 --> 01:41:09.865]  Oh, we're going to tax porn.
[01:41:10.125 --> 01:41:13.087]  Then you read the next sentence and everything else basically on the web.
[01:41:13.387 --> 01:41:16.810]  And that sets up the monitoring, the control, the bureaucracy.
[01:41:17.250 --> 01:41:20.052]  We had a tax bureaucrat show up just an hour ago here at the office.
[01:41:20.072 --> 01:41:21.433]  They're erecting all these new taxes.
[01:41:22.173 --> 01:41:24.195]  And they show up and say, we don't even know what the real rules are.
[01:41:24.255 --> 01:41:26.456]  Just pay us what we think or we'll come after you.
[01:41:27.437 --> 01:41:28.858]  I mean, it's just, you know,
[01:41:29.898 --> 01:41:30.698]  It's out of control.
[01:41:31.179 --> 01:41:33.319]  Anything else, Greg?
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:42.782]  I just want to urge all of your listeners to get the video, make the copies as you say you are, and massively and quickly get them out there for our own safety.
[01:41:43.282 --> 01:41:45.223]  And then I just wanted to ask one question.
[01:41:45.363 --> 01:41:50.025]  Is this digital TV conversion situation that's going on have anything to do with conspiracy?
[01:41:50.605 --> 01:41:50.845]  Okay.
[01:41:52.216 --> 01:41:55.718]  That's meant to bankrupt smaller community TV stations and systems.
[01:41:56.718 --> 01:42:01.121]  Also, it's admitted mind control, the flicker rate, the way they do television.
[01:42:02.261 --> 01:42:08.364]  And yes, the subliminal programming is that much stronger with the digital signal.
[01:42:08.384 --> 01:42:10.906]  I've even been to the University of Texas Psychology Department years ago.
[01:42:10.926 --> 01:42:13.427]  I mean, just there they were studying it for the Pentagon.
[01:42:14.727 --> 01:42:16.929]  Ninety percent of their research plus was DARPA.
[01:42:17.509 --> 01:42:19.010]  And yes, folks,
[01:42:19.770 --> 01:42:25.075]  You have got to turn off mainstream television, and I would even spend too much time, you know, overly on the internet.
[01:42:25.436 --> 01:42:28.839]  You use the visual medium to wake up those that are in the matrix.
[01:42:29.259 --> 01:42:32.582]  But, you know, watching limited clips for analysis, whatever, that's fine.
[01:42:33.503 --> 01:42:37.788]  But, you know, even spending too much time on the web itself, unless you're doing it as an activist tool consciously.
[01:42:38.869 --> 01:42:40.710]  I've told the story a couple of...
[01:42:42.105 --> 01:42:48.291]  Falls ago, about a year and a half ago, I was out at my family farm and ranch when I was with my uncle.
[01:42:49.032 --> 01:42:52.395]  And he's aware of the New World Order and Army Veteran, helicopter pilot, all that stuff, Vietnam.
[01:42:52.876 --> 01:42:56.319]  And he's watching sports, college football.
[01:42:56.419 --> 01:42:57.601]  That's all he watches, TV.
[01:42:59.302 --> 01:43:01.565]  And I said, do you see that subliminal, Uncle?
[01:43:02.728 --> 01:43:04.691]  And Uncle Bev, and he said no.
[01:43:05.191 --> 01:43:08.495]  And because he was unconscious, he was sitting there watching TV, and I said, okay, you've got to be conscious.
[01:43:08.535 --> 01:43:09.557]  It comes up about every minute.
[01:43:10.037 --> 01:43:17.646]  They flash for about half a second or less than half a second, different Miller Lite Home Depot ads, and that is subliminal.
[01:43:17.686 --> 01:43:18.367]  It's not a mistake.
[01:43:19.068 --> 01:43:20.168]  And I said, uh, watch.
[01:43:20.888 --> 01:43:23.069]  And about five times he couldn't get himself conscious.
[01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.969]  And I said, okay, here it is!
[01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.489]  Here it is!
[01:43:24.549 --> 01:43:25.009]  Open your eyes!
[01:43:25.069 --> 01:43:25.409]  Focus!
[01:43:25.449 --> 01:43:25.789]  Focus!
[01:43:25.829 --> 01:43:26.189]  Focus!
[01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:28.410]  And he went, oh, oh man, I saw it!
[01:43:29.110 --> 01:43:33.231]  And that's because it takes about 45 minutes on average, depending on the studies.
[01:43:33.471 --> 01:43:34.731]  With old TV, now it's faster.
[01:43:35.971 --> 01:43:39.112]  The first time you watch it, to go into a lower dream state.
[01:43:39.132 --> 01:43:40.372]  I mean, they hook electrodes on.
[01:43:40.412 --> 01:43:40.953]  It's a fact.
[01:43:40.993 --> 01:43:46.174]  You go into a dream state, a subconscious level where everything's going through, just the flicker rate alone.
[01:43:46.194 --> 01:43:47.874]  You know, it's like the flashing light for hypnotism.
[01:43:49.201 --> 01:43:51.858]  Now, when they added all the other stuff, it just compounds it.
[01:43:52.646 --> 01:44:18.117]  So, what happens is, after you watch TV a lot, within a few seconds, you go into that couch potato mode, and it doesn't matter if in the conscious mind you're aware of the New World Order, now you're being bombarded, you're being acclimated, you can't help but smile back at the info babe who's making all these sexual overtures, like she wants to mate with you, but it's really just a television set and a woman in New York or Chicago or D.C.
[01:44:18.917 --> 01:44:20.198]  or L.A., and she's,
[01:44:21.378 --> 01:44:25.239]  And they're all laughing and it's fun and they've got the cute guy for the women to like him.
[01:44:25.259 --> 01:44:31.401]  And it's all crafted and there's messages in the sitcoms and the dramas to condition you.
[01:44:32.581 --> 01:44:38.843]  And now they've got all these mainstream shows admitting world government, secret groups, they're bad, the government's going to nuke you and false flag.
[01:44:39.223 --> 01:44:48.326]  That's only done to acclimate the subconscious so that when they hear us talking about the real world, people won't be shocked because they've already had that template run through their mind
[01:44:48.746 --> 01:44:56.071]  Through all these dramas and through all these programs to where, oh, I've heard of government nuking to get total control before or releasing a bioweapon.
[01:44:56.352 --> 01:44:57.272]  That's on TV shows.
[01:44:57.312 --> 01:45:04.478]  So you're in a comfortable setting in your home, in your couch, watching TV with a beer or popcorn or with dinner with your wife and children.
[01:45:04.958 --> 01:45:05.718]  And so you're watching.
[01:45:06.579 --> 01:45:12.987]  Horrible things, martial law, the MTV ads where trucks pull up and grab everybody and take them out and throw them in a truck and take them to a camp.
[01:45:13.287 --> 01:45:22.698]  That's done to condition you so that when you really see it, you've been subconsciously acclimated because the body has a physical memory of your hormonal level.
[01:45:23.739 --> 01:45:25.860]  At a good level, a restful level.
[01:45:26.521 --> 01:45:29.002]  You were in a comfortable position with comfortable temperature.
[01:45:29.482 --> 01:45:37.827]  So when your mind sees these hard... I mean, you're meant, the way humans are designed through our development, that if you see people being grabbed and bashed and killed, that was real.
[01:45:37.847 --> 01:45:39.788]  Lots of people 50 years ago would get upset by that.
[01:45:40.048 --> 01:45:41.228]  It wasn't that they were wimps.
[01:45:41.328 --> 01:45:44.790]  It was that they were geared that when you're seeing blood and guts, you're supposed to smell it.
[01:45:44.970 --> 01:45:46.571]  You're supposed to have high adrenaline levels.
[01:45:46.631 --> 01:45:47.312]  It's combat.
[01:45:47.352 --> 01:45:47.772]  It's war.
[01:45:48.172 --> 01:46:02.738]  But now you're just going through a video game shooting people and zombies all day and raping prostitutes for extra cash in the games and you're doing it in a comfortable position so it's mass programming to where when the real thing happens you're unable to respond because you've been programmed.
[01:46:02.758 --> 01:46:03.278]  You understand?
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:07.600]  Much Alex.
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:08.761]  Thank you.
[01:46:08.801 --> 01:46:11.362]  Do you have any final comments on what I just said Mr. Williams?
[01:46:11.962 --> 01:46:15.363]  Well it's just frightening that they think it through so thoroughly.
[01:46:16.584 --> 01:46:17.024]  But they do.
[01:46:18.030 --> 01:46:20.291]  It's frightening that they give it that much thought.
[01:46:22.611 --> 01:46:24.392]  Well, there is a war on for your mind.
[01:46:24.452 --> 01:46:28.233]  That's our motto at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:46:29.873 --> 01:46:36.675]  And if that doesn't insult you and upset you, that they've taken over most of your minds, even if you believe you're conscious.
[01:46:38.235 --> 01:46:40.836]  People need to stop watching so much television.
[01:46:40.876 --> 01:46:42.476]  I've just about cut it off completely.
[01:46:42.577 --> 01:46:43.997]  Thirty minutes a day, that's about it.
[01:46:44.975 --> 01:46:49.018]  Absolutely, and then I train myself to consciously make myself stay conscious during it.
[01:46:49.038 --> 01:46:50.900]  I mean, it's a battle, folks.
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:53.121]  You've got to look away and you've got to stay focused.
[01:46:53.162 --> 01:46:54.443]  I mean, you know, it's serious.
[01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:57.309]  Yeah, it's time to re-engage reality.
[01:46:57.349 --> 01:47:02.491]  It's time to go out and be involved with your community and be involved in activities.
[01:47:02.531 --> 01:47:08.332]  It doesn't all have to be scary and telling people about what's happening.
[01:47:08.672 --> 01:47:14.654]  Just engaging your community is going to help things, just naturally, because that's the right order of things.
[01:47:15.575 --> 01:47:16.116]  Absolutely.
[01:47:16.156 --> 01:47:26.226]  If you knock on most of the doors in your town or your neighborhood or you go to city council and talk about issues, they're going to know that when the real thing comes down their street, they're going to remember.
[01:47:26.266 --> 01:47:28.809]  And a lot of the seeds that don't sprout right away, sprout later.
[01:47:28.829 --> 01:47:30.450]  And so that's the key here.
[01:47:35.595 --> 01:47:37.456]  We really appreciate you joining us.
[01:47:37.496 --> 01:47:41.439]  We appreciate the fine work that TheDailyNewscaster.com is doing.
[01:47:42.119 --> 01:47:47.543]  And we appreciate you coming on the show with us today, Doug Williams.
[01:47:47.903 --> 01:47:49.684]  And I look forward to speaking to you again in the future.
[01:47:49.724 --> 01:47:50.505]  Keep up the great work.
[01:47:51.025 --> 01:47:52.066]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:47:52.686 --> 01:47:53.387]  You better take care.
[01:47:53.407 --> 01:47:54.067]  Good to hear from you.
[01:47:54.087 --> 01:47:56.269]  We're going to come back in the final segment with a few calls.
[01:47:56.289 --> 01:47:58.070]  I want to hit a few news stories right now.
[01:48:00.974 --> 01:48:06.179]  This issue of arresting you if you photograph the police in England now an act of terrorism isn't a crime to take pictures.
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:19.193]  But before we dig that out of the stack and do that, and talk to Tony and Scott if we have time, we should, two more sponsors that made this radio show possible
[01:48:20.549 --> 01:48:22.373]  One of them is my solar backup.
[01:48:22.714 --> 01:48:24.558]  The great folks from Solutions from Science.
[01:48:24.999 --> 01:48:26.903]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:48:26.943 --> 01:48:29.148]  Hurricanes, snow ice and storms.
[01:48:29.208 --> 01:48:30.150]  Listeners should move towards.
[01:48:31.257 --> 01:48:33.739]  Getting off the grid, and here is a good way to do just that.
[01:48:33.779 --> 01:48:37.722]  A solar power generator is now available from our long-time sponsor, Solutions for Science.
[01:48:37.762 --> 01:48:43.006]  It's designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[01:48:43.446 --> 01:48:51.753]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of a power source, 1,800 power plant, and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:48:51.833 --> 01:48:53.254]  That's right, it generates free electricity.
[01:48:53.534 --> 01:48:57.197]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps
[01:48:59.943 --> 01:49:02.164]  Pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:49:02.624 --> 01:49:05.686]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[01:49:06.086 --> 01:49:07.967]  It's perfect for emergency backup for troubled times.
[01:49:08.387 --> 01:49:11.209]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move now.
[01:49:11.489 --> 01:49:14.571]  Their website is www.mysolarbackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:49:20.434 --> 01:49:21.554]  877-327-0365.
[01:49:23.615 --> 01:49:30.599]  And I also want to tell you about another great seed company that we have that is a sponsor.
[01:49:31.399 --> 01:49:33.380]  That's SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:36.902]  The word SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:49:36.942 --> 01:49:40.444]  Grow your own healthy food for just four pennies a pound and break free from the new world order.
[01:49:40.484 --> 01:49:45.346]  The family business buys in massive bulk and passes those huge discounts on to our listeners.
[01:49:45.366 --> 01:49:48.088]  15,000 heirloom seeds will provide you and your family with seven years
[01:49:49.204 --> 01:49:49.944]  of healthy food.
[01:49:50.044 --> 01:49:52.585]  Stop buying and eating New World Order garbage.
[01:49:52.665 --> 01:49:54.325]  Grow your own healthy food in your own backyard.
[01:49:54.365 --> 01:49:56.705]  That's 15,000 heirloom seeds for a great price.
[01:49:56.805 --> 01:49:58.706]  That's real food insurance for difficult times.
[01:49:58.946 --> 01:49:59.666]  We're already entering.
[01:49:59.966 --> 01:50:03.087]  Heirloom seeds are the original varieties, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[01:50:03.447 --> 01:50:05.307]  All the seeds date back to over a century.
[01:50:05.647 --> 01:50:07.428]  The Mayflower bean came over on the Mayflower ship.
[01:50:07.728 --> 01:50:14.749]  Now survivalofseeds.com wants you to become one of their heirloom seed farmers and sell back to them your safe seeds year after year because
[01:50:15.129 --> 01:50:17.590]  Demand is skyrocketing for these rare heirloom seeds.
[01:50:17.890 --> 01:50:22.913]  You'll also get a DVD teaching you how to sell your vegetable produce to restaurants, delis, and farmers markets.
[01:50:23.293 --> 01:50:24.093]  Slaves hesitate.
[01:50:24.153 --> 01:50:25.054]  Patriots take action.
[01:50:25.354 --> 01:50:29.776]  Survivalofseeds.com, a family business that is helping the truth movement prepare.
[01:50:30.376 --> 01:50:33.178]  If you can't feed your family, the FEMA camps will, folks.
[01:50:33.218 --> 01:50:37.500]  And they won't move with this if they know we're self-sufficient and can live on our own.
[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:38.640]  Survivalofseeds.com.
[01:50:41.172 --> 01:50:44.556]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are entering the final segment.
[01:50:44.576 --> 01:50:51.863]  We'll jam in two of your phone calls and then get into one final news story right here on the one and the only GCN Radio Network.
[01:50:52.604 --> 01:50:58.690]  I'm Alex Jones, and you want to check out the new, redesigned, and expanded TheObamaDeception.net.
[01:50:59.070 --> 01:51:00.832]  TheObamaDeception.net.
[01:51:01.253 --> 01:51:02.234]  The final segment.
[01:51:02.554 --> 01:51:03.275]  Stay the course.
[01:51:03.715 --> 01:51:04.296]  Straight ahead.
[01:51:07.817 --> 01:51:13.302]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:51:13.342 --> 01:51:13.862]  and the world.
[01:51:14.122 --> 01:51:17.585]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:51:17.986 --> 01:51:24.231]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:51:24.491 --> 01:51:26.272]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:31.737]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[01:51:31.937 --> 01:51:32.237]  I think so.

[01:52:05.578 --> 01:52:08.279]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:52:08.559 --> 01:52:12.000]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:52:12.181 --> 01:52:14.021]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:52:14.301 --> 01:52:17.363]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:52:17.663 --> 01:52:18.643]  It is essential that patriots
[01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:20.549]  Let's do it!
[01:52:44.943 --> 01:52:48.925]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[01:52:49.085 --> 01:52:53.607]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.

[01:53:30.191 --> 01:53:32.552]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[01:53:32.912 --> 01:53:35.013]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:53:35.053 --> 01:53:35.513]  this fall?

[01:54:20.981 --> 01:54:36.655]  Tony in Arizona.
[01:54:36.675 --> 01:54:37.035]  Go ahead.
[01:54:37.055 --> 01:54:37.576]  You're on the air.
[01:54:37.596 --> 01:54:38.297]  Thanks for holding.
[01:54:38.317 --> 01:54:41.179]  Hello?
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:42.060]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:42.781]  Yes.
[01:54:43.201 --> 01:54:44.862]  Pleasure to speak with you, Alex.
[01:54:45.743 --> 01:54:47.585]  I heard you on Coast to Coast last night.
[01:54:48.303 --> 01:54:57.705]  And one thing that I noticed about the representatives, of course I understand there's only so much time on the air in that format.
[01:54:58.145 --> 01:55:07.528]  The thing is, I noticed that the representatives seem to be concerned a lot with, you know, mandates, mandates by the federal government.
[01:55:08.108 --> 01:55:11.629]  And there are some other concerns.
[01:55:12.169 --> 01:55:16.210]  And for one thing, you know, I have a very dear friend of mine who
[01:55:17.328 --> 01:55:22.774]  Uh, because of IRS problems, put a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.
[01:55:24.676 --> 01:55:30.542]  And there is this tyranny by the IRS and this crazy quilt of a
[01:55:31.055 --> 01:55:35.837]  Three-quarter of a million word income tax code that's been going on for decades.
[01:55:35.917 --> 01:55:38.317]  This has been going on, you know, before North Carolina.
[01:55:38.357 --> 01:55:42.659]  Yeah, they've written it where you can't comply with even their unconstitutional fraudulent law.
[01:55:42.679 --> 01:55:43.899]  We didn't have an income tax until 1913.
[01:55:43.999 --> 01:55:46.140]  It wasn't widely adopted until the 50s.
[01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:50.181]  And we do expose that and fight that, and the states seem to speak out against that as well.
[01:55:50.701 --> 01:55:51.642]  Yes, yes, they do.
[01:55:52.082 --> 01:55:58.244]  Because, you know, because individually, as many have complained about the IRS,
[01:55:59.776 --> 01:56:02.618]  There hasn't been really any move.
[01:56:02.998 --> 01:56:07.682]  The way to bring them down is to show you write your check to the private Federal Reserve, not into the IRS.
[01:56:07.742 --> 01:56:08.843]  It's a collection agency.
[01:56:09.223 --> 01:56:09.884]  I've got to jump.
[01:56:09.984 --> 01:56:10.504]  Great points.
[01:56:10.544 --> 01:56:12.146]  Call me back in the next few days and we'll talk more about it.
[01:56:12.606 --> 01:56:14.247]  Tony, Scott in California.
[01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:14.648]  Go ahead.
[01:56:16.289 --> 01:56:17.370]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:18.591]  Scott from California.
[01:56:19.131 --> 01:56:27.578]  I read an article on InfoWars yesterday from gun owners of America about the provisions that are in the stimulus package.
[01:56:28.151 --> 01:56:34.874]  You have a psychological database of everybody, federalization, 19 million dollars to federalize all medical records.
[01:56:35.574 --> 01:56:56.404]  Yes, and I just wanted to bring a point that I think might be interesting, is if you look at Nazis in Germany and leftists all over the planet, some of the first things that they do is round up groups like homosexuals, the mentally ill,
[01:56:58.696 --> 01:57:01.139]  That's called eugenics.
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:07.525]  And they want to control health care so they can control populations and they say they're going to ration it.
[01:57:09.107 --> 01:57:10.829]  It's just hellish what these people are doing.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:18.682]  Well, you know, it just looks to me, because getting into your mental health records is one of the hardest things to do in this country.
[01:57:19.102 --> 01:57:19.882]  Well, exactly.
[01:57:19.942 --> 01:57:24.564]  But I mean, more than that, you think Nixon's bad with Enemies List or Clinton or Bush.
[01:57:24.964 --> 01:57:31.505]  Imagine when the Feds, and they can already do it with most systems, pull up everything about you, your bank account, you know, all your medical stuff.
[01:57:31.645 --> 01:57:32.806]  Look what they did to Joe the Plumber.
[01:57:34.266 --> 01:57:40.188]  I mean, and it turned out they'd accessed, the Feds had accessed the campaign, giving hundreds of times all his data.
[01:57:41.802 --> 01:57:43.545]  And nobody got in trouble for that?
[01:57:46.328 --> 01:57:48.010]  The only thing that happened was one lady quit.
[01:57:48.751 --> 01:57:48.912]  Yeah.
[01:57:49.372 --> 01:57:49.753]  I hear you.
[01:57:49.773 --> 01:57:50.313]  I'm going to jump.
[01:57:50.373 --> 01:57:51.375]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:53.097 --> 01:57:54.599]  Magnus, I don't have time to get to you.
[01:57:54.619 --> 01:57:55.200]  I'm sorry.
[01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:56.662]  I'll be back live tomorrow.
[01:57:59.517 --> 01:58:01.559]  I'll be back live tomorrow, 11 to 3 p.m.
[01:58:01.579 --> 01:58:02.219]  Central Center Time.
[01:58:02.239 --> 01:58:05.121]  Rebroadcast starts now, One Place, InfoWars.com on the web.
[01:58:05.141 --> 01:58:07.443]  Don't forget the free podcast you can subscribe to.
[01:58:07.783 --> 01:58:12.847]  You know, I'm not perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, and I know none of you are perfect, and I appreciate all your support.
[01:58:13.968 --> 01:58:16.289]  I appreciate George Norrie having that historical show last night.
[01:58:16.309 --> 01:58:19.432]  We got the YouTube audio of that posted up on InfoWars.com as well.
[01:58:20.996 --> 01:58:29.180]  I want to just thank God for the gifts I've been given to be able to make films, do radio shows, be able to analyze this stuff, be able to work this hard.
[01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:35.523]  These gifts I was given that I squandered for so long, I'm trying to put them to full use and really be more professional and go to the next level.
[01:58:35.823 --> 01:58:36.764]  God bless you all!
[01:58:36.784 --> 01:58:41.246]  We'll see you back in 70 seconds online at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:41.566 --> 01:58:42.006]  Take care!
[01:58:42.026 --> 01:58:43.127]  Get out there and fight tyranny!

[01:58:57.056 --> 01:58:57.636]  Hello, friends.
[01:58:57.696 --> 01:58:58.636]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:58.756 --> 01:59:03.358]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:59:03.478 --> 01:59:06.240]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:09.321]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:09.501 --> 01:59:14.203]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:14.443 --> 01:59:15.344]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:15.564 --> 01:59:18.506]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:18.806 --> 01:59:25.712]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:25.792 --> 01:59:28.934]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
