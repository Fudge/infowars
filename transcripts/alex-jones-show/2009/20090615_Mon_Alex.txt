[00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:02.986]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.368]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:13.374]  Big Brother.
[00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:15.095]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:16.876]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:18.378]  You want answers?
[00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:20.079]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.362]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:29.006]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:31.676]  We are live, my friends.
[00:00:31.816 --> 00:00:33.877]  It is the 15th day on this Monday.
[00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:36.878]  It is Monday, June 15th, 2009.
[00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:48.042]  We've got two hours left spanning out like a vista before us as we go in through and beyond as we talk to one of the most prolific researchers
[00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:55.580]  One of the most prolific minds out there in challenging the established false reality.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.862]  He is a great dispenser of hundreds of millions of red pills to humanity.
[00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:10.583]  And he has taken a lot of people very, very deep down the rabbit hole, indeed, to where we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:01:10.623 --> 00:01:15.484]  And you can question and debate the perceptions through the rose-colored darkly that
[00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:24.147]  David Icke looks through, but be careful that when you're getting the speck out of his eye, you don't get the giant beam out of yours.
[00:01:24.187 --> 00:01:25.388]  It's important to get that beam out.
[00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:34.593]  We all see through different perceptions, but certainly the perception of David Icke has proven to be much more clear than the average man or woman out there.
[00:01:34.613 --> 00:01:35.913]  So it's always great to have David with us.
[00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.054]  I have a host of issues.
[00:01:37.774 --> 00:01:53.485]  Talk to him about where the new world order is going, what they're doing currently, trying to start World War III with Iran, trying to start things up over there, trying to start things up with North Korea, knowing they're in the middle of a power sharing and a power transfer, saying they're going to board their ships, a new Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:01:54.286 --> 00:01:56.127]  Again, we're not defending North Korea or Iran.
[00:01:56.147 --> 00:02:00.868]  The point is, it's the bigger globalist evil using a smaller evil to bring in a global distraction.
[00:02:01.508 --> 00:02:13.891]  And the South Ossetia conflict, NATO encircling Russia, Pakistan, all of this today as the world launches into economic collapse, launches into worldwide warfare, as the Rand Corporation has called for.
[00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:16.652]  So joining us, David Icke.com is the website.
[00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:21.994]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com is the great David Icke.
[00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:23.574]  David Icke, thank you for joining us.
[00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:24.635]  It's a pleasure, Alex.
[00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:25.175]  How are you?
[00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:26.456]  Good.
[00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:31.039]  You heard me run down some of the ideas of things that I think are important right now.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.443]  Let's start with suddenly somebody flips a switch and there's world crises.
[00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:37.985]  We're on the edge of nuclear war.
[00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:40.827]  They're saying North Korea is going to nuke.
[00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:42.408]  They're saying they're going to nuke people.
[00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:47.432]  Months ago, you were on the show, three or four months ago, and you said you thought they were gearing up for a world war.
[00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:54.850]  Yeah, well that's where they want to go because the world wars have served them very well.
[00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:04.358]  Nothing changes society quicker and more fundamentally and completely and irreversibly than a war.
[00:03:04.978 --> 00:03:14.847]  And so when you look at the world after World War I, it was a world that was controlled by far fewer people and much more centralization of power than before.
[00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:42.666]  World War II came along, that process took a giant leap forward, and we had all these global institutions, and the United Nations, the Bretton Woods Agreement, the European Union was justified to a large extent to stopping war in Europe, and so to complete the job, to move into this final global society that they want, a third world war is on the agenda, and I don't know if I've mentioned this before, but
[00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:57.877]  I had a letter from a traffic warden, a guy here in Britain, that's supposed to just dispense tickets for people who have broken the parking laws, and he contacted me, must be a year or so ago now.
[00:03:58.872 --> 00:03:59.152]  I don't know.
[00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.872]  And the third one was a card giving him, a traffic warden, the right to enter property without permission.
[00:04:26.372 --> 00:04:29.873]  And of course he's questioning, what the heck do I need these for?
[00:04:29.913 --> 00:04:31.834]  Well, just go leave them until further notice.
[00:04:32.434 --> 00:04:35.815]  He then meets a friend of his a few days later, who's a police officer.
[00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:44.798]  And he said that, this police officer said that he was a man designated in his county, and there was someone like him in every county.
[00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:48.039]  And they were there to prepare for a coming war.
[00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:49.270]  Stay there.
[00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.991]  Stay there, David.
[00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:50.471]  Got a break.
[00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:51.553]  Long segment coming up.
[00:04:51.913 --> 00:04:53.175]  Recap that when we come back.
[00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:55.018]  Same thing is happening here.
[00:04:55.498 --> 00:05:01.446]  I can independently verify with government documents what you just said in the United States, Canada, Australia.
[00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:03.730]  You're a proper... We'll be right back with David Icke.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.224]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:05:13.444 --> 00:05:17.226]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:23.071]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:28.214]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:28.935]  Number three,
[00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:34.778]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:05:35.638 --> 00:05:38.279]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.941]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:46.643]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:05:46.903 --> 00:05:52.389]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[00:06:09.881 --> 00:06:14.483]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:06:14.623 --> 00:06:17.385]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:06:17.605 --> 00:06:20.446]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:25.349]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:26.490]  If you simply prepare.
[00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.652]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:36.836]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:16.041]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.898]  Well, he needs no introduction.
[00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:24.159]  I know some stations weren't caring in that last segment.
[00:08:24.179 --> 00:08:35.741]  He was telling a story about a traffic warden who he knows in England, who said he was given a card to put away for secret emergencies to be able to enter homes without warrants.
[00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:38.741]  And then his friend didn't really know what that would be used for.
[00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:43.822]  Then he talked to another police officer who explained to him the key piece of the puzzle.
[00:08:43.842 --> 00:08:49.563]  And then I was saying to David, I can independently verify this is even in our news, with InfraGard,
[00:08:51.109 --> 00:08:52.812]  We told people about a year before it was in the news.
[00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.314]  Now they admit it.
[00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:55.636]  56,000 and growing.
[00:08:55.716 --> 00:08:56.758]  That's a year old numbers.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.182]  Infrastructure protection.
[00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:02.246]  Key people in power plants, refineries, businesses.
[00:09:03.689 --> 00:09:06.032]  I have a guy here who worked in LCRA security.
[00:09:07.148 --> 00:09:14.275]  And five years, six years ago, about a year before he worked here, they gave him a card for infrastructure security, basically a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[00:09:15.056 --> 00:09:18.340]  And all the police have these badges, they're supposed to keep them away.
[00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:26.848]  And they're saying, oh yes, the American people are the terrorists, the British people are the terrorists, homeland security's for them, martial law's coming, a war is coming.
[00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:29.231]  David, continue with what the police officer told you.
[00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:41.006]  Well, the police officer, who is a friend of this traffic warden, he called him aside one day and said, look, because I'm a good friend of you, I'm going to tell you this, but he said five times in the conversation, you must not tell anyone else.
[00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:49.051]  And what the police officer said was that he had a job in that county, and there was someone like him in every other county of the United Kingdom.
[00:09:49.772 --> 00:09:56.896]  And their job in the police force was to prepare for a coming war, which they knew was coming, and they were preparing for it well in advance.
[00:09:59.313 --> 00:10:16.567]  The military and the regular police were going to be used to meet what they knew was coming in terms of civil unrest in the streets when that war started and then the build-up to that war.
[00:10:17.107 --> 00:10:25.774]  And he said, you people, traffic wardens and private security guards and other such people, are going to be given powers
[00:10:27.154 --> 00:10:33.318]  That the police normally do, so that you can do those things while we're dealing with the civil unrest as a result of this war.
[00:10:33.978 --> 00:10:51.347]  And very, very shortly after the traffic warden contacted me, the government changed the name of traffic wardens from traffic wardens to civil enforcement officers, and gave them more powers, not all the powers, but more powers that the police normally do.
[00:10:51.367 --> 00:10:53.768]  And then about six months later,
[00:10:54.597 --> 00:11:17.415]  The government announced a new type of person called accredited persons and these were, wait for it, private security guards and all the kind of people that the policeman had listed who were going to be given the right to stop and question people, to hand out certain fines, to hold them until the police arrived and it's all part of this
[00:11:18.535 --> 00:11:23.558]  Layer by layer building of self-policing, the people self-policing each other.
[00:11:23.598 --> 00:11:31.481]  Because, of course, when there's a few of you and you want to control the many, there's not enough of you physically to do it.
[00:11:31.842 --> 00:11:38.625]  So you have to get your target population, or many of the people within it, to police the target population.
[00:11:38.645 --> 00:11:45.308]  You have to get the sheep herd to police each other so they don't need so many sheepdogs externally and
[00:11:46.048 --> 00:12:13.057]  Shepherds externally that the sheep are doing it for themselves and this is what's being built all over the world and this this third world war is definitely in the agenda because it's a massive problem which will be in need of a global because of the global nature of the conflict a global solution which will be the the final move to this structure we've been talking about all these years of world government world army and all the rest of it of course the world army is
[00:12:13.797 --> 00:12:15.519]  Okay, David, I just want to back you up.
[00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:37.019]  Because people are hearing this, or months from now, watching this on YouTube or PrisonPlanet.TV, and they're saying, okay, what's the proof?
[00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:44.468]  Everything David just said, every term he used, I have hundreds of mainstream articles, government documents.
[00:12:44.488 --> 00:12:45.630]  Let me just go over a few of them.
[00:12:46.752 --> 00:12:51.935]  Here in the United States, they are preparing paramilitary police.
[00:12:52.195 --> 00:12:54.236]  It's announced by the Air Force, the Army.
[00:12:54.516 --> 00:12:59.699]  They have regular Army in Tennessee, without warrants, running warrantless checkpoints in the newspaper.
[00:13:00.099 --> 00:13:06.363]  NorthCom has announced that they are to take on the American people, the Homeland Security documents.
[00:13:07.204 --> 00:13:18.038]  uh... dhs documents we broke the main national news state the number one threat is returning vets gun owners that the whole homeland security system is for us the british ministry of defense ten-year report
[00:13:19.178 --> 00:13:42.456]  London Guardian reported on it, but it was declassified, 120 pages, was put out in September of 2007, and said in the coming next few years, the public would rebel against the corrupt government, but that their job was to suppress the public, to bring us into this new world order, and it said they will, even if the British people, they say, try to march on London,
[00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.878]  They will use neutron bombs on them.
[00:13:59.827 --> 00:14:05.151]  The spooks, the paramilitary, the police, the traffic wardens, auxiliary tattletales.
[00:14:05.431 --> 00:14:09.354]  There's now the Trusted Traveler North American Hemispheric Card.
[00:14:09.634 --> 00:14:15.298]  And if you have that flying internally, say from Austin to New York, you show that and go through the head of the line.
[00:14:15.598 --> 00:14:20.942]  So they're already making it that if you waive all your rights and take the special card, you get to the head of the line.
[00:14:20.962 --> 00:14:23.444]  Then they're just going to make it mandatory for everybody.
[00:14:23.464 --> 00:14:23.864]  David Iye.
[00:14:24.434 --> 00:14:25.174]  Well, that's what they do.
[00:14:25.334 --> 00:14:33.677]  I mean, they say, oh, this will be voluntarily for the people to decide if they want to have it, like identity cards and stuff like that.
[00:14:34.017 --> 00:14:38.538]  But what they then do is make it so difficult to operate in society without one of them.
[00:14:39.018 --> 00:14:45.580]  And eventually they say, well, look, there's so few people that don't have them now, everyone might as well have them by law and all the rest of it.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.740]  These are the techniques they use.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.281]  And of course, as we've talked about before on the show,
[00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:51.109]  I think so.
[00:15:06.676 --> 00:15:07.116]  I think?
[00:15:26.858 --> 00:15:41.113]  How long are we going to talk about this before we draw a line in the sand and say, hey, instead of sitting here and watching our prison being built and discussing it and debating it, what the heck are we going to do about it?
[00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:45.157]  Because there's going to come a point where we're going to cross a line where this
[00:15:46.699 --> 00:15:50.322]  Well, David Icke, I heartily agree with you and we're going to talk about a host of issues today.
[00:16:09.258 --> 00:16:14.999]  And later in the next hour, let's get into some of your ideas for solutions and breaking free of this matrix.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.680]  In fact, let's go ahead and start talking about some of that now.
[00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:29.663]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play a video clip from a satire movie about sitcoms, but when you watch it,
[00:16:30.931 --> 00:16:47.856]  It actually has the same messages that really are in the children's programming and the sitcoms, and they're dumbing the language down, and they're reducing the language, and how many words people use, and people are talking slower, and people don't even understand common words now.
[00:16:49.156 --> 00:16:51.857]  People are being inserted into the matrix.
[00:16:52.857 --> 00:17:02.782]  As the eyes tie into the television and the computers and people are texting to their friends who are five feet away, instead of talking to them, we are beginning to merge into the machines.
[00:17:02.862 --> 00:17:04.122]  We're not programming them.
[00:17:04.142 --> 00:17:07.984]  We're being programmed through the machines that have been programmed to program us.
[00:17:08.384 --> 00:17:14.107]  And the consciousness is closing down with large swaths of the public, while at the same time,
[00:17:14.927 --> 00:17:25.413]  Another large group is exploding their awakening and how you see this battle unfolding as we rush towards what the establishment calls the singularity.
[00:17:29.656 --> 00:17:31.017]  So David, what's your take on that?
[00:17:32.125 --> 00:17:33.665]  I thought we were going to a break.
[00:17:33.705 --> 00:17:37.086]  No, I'm saying when we come back from break, I'm going to play a clip, but I mean now... Oh, gotcha, gotcha.
[00:17:37.106 --> 00:17:38.407]  I thought we were going to a break now.
[00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:51.410]  No, I mean, you know, this is my area, really, in so many ways, because particularly since about 2002, 2003, I've really gone very, very deeply into the nature of reality, which not many people tend to do.
[00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:59.172]  And when you start to realize what reality is, my goodness, does society as it's structured, and the way it's structured, start to make perfect sense.
[00:17:59.992 --> 00:18:00.532]  First of all,
[00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:05.423]  It's so important to realize the difference between the body and consciousness.
[00:18:05.983 --> 00:18:07.423]  It's not the same thing.
[00:18:07.804 --> 00:18:25.571]  Now, you know, we may have differing religions, different people listen to this show, but one thing is kind of common to them is that some kind of consciousness, soul, whatever you want to call it, is apart from the body and leaves the body at what we call death.
[00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:27.672]  Therefore, the body and the
[00:18:28.743 --> 00:18:32.034]  The soul, the consciousness, whatever you want to call it, are not the same thing.
[00:18:33.384 --> 00:18:42.946]  The idea of the conspiracy, the very bottom line of the conspiracy, is to disconnect those higher levels of awareness from what is a computer, the body.
[00:18:43.006 --> 00:18:47.947]  The body is a biological computer and it ticks every single box of that.
[00:18:47.967 --> 00:18:58.289]  And what I mean by biological is it's not like a desktop computer where you put data in and you press a button and you know exactly what it's going to do because it's programmed to do that, although we're getting more and more like that.
[00:18:58.949 --> 00:18:59.549]  We're good to go.
[00:19:13.946 --> 00:19:14.486]  I think so.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:57.511]  Sense of reality and what that does it pulls you into all the programs that are running through the body like software programs And these are all reaction programs which get you to react to data ie Situations they create in the world in precisely the way they want us to react so we become little more than biological robots, which is where most people in this world are and
[00:19:58.809 --> 00:20:07.771]  More and more, I mean, I've always known this concept to be true, you know, the scientists and mind warper experts say it themselves, but now I'm consciously really realizing it.
[00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:08.231]  Stay with us.
[00:20:12.232 --> 00:20:13.072]  Newsflash!
[00:20:13.432 --> 00:20:15.073]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[00:20:15.833 --> 00:20:20.134]  The dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[00:20:21.697 --> 00:20:25.639]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:29.901]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[00:20:30.301 --> 00:20:36.124]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy food.
[00:20:37.305 --> 00:20:45.388]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced price.
[00:20:45.629 --> 00:20:49.470]  So you and your family have a long-term food solution.
[00:20:50.931 --> 00:20:54.593]  The choice between starvation and freedom is made by you.
[00:20:54.733 --> 00:20:55.834]  Right now.

[00:21:09.344 --> 00:21:14.671]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:15.372 --> 00:21:20.719]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:27.428]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:27.748 --> 00:21:29.569]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:29.709 --> 00:21:32.111]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:43.138]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:45.379 --> 00:21:46.640]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.441]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:55.125]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:21:55.791 --> 00:22:03.579]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.221]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:05.641 --> 00:22:06.902]  The people strike back.
[00:22:09.505 --> 00:22:11.507]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources.
[00:22:11.527 --> 00:22:11.968]  800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:22:12.028 --> 00:22:13.289]  And let's take in a brief mind mover.
[00:22:17.776 --> 00:22:23.239]  We're surrounded by jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[00:22:23.459 --> 00:22:29.062]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[00:22:29.262 --> 00:22:30.963]  The stimulus package is working.
[00:22:31.264 --> 00:22:32.804]  A bailout is coming your way.
[00:22:33.145 --> 00:22:37.067]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[00:22:37.347 --> 00:22:37.727]  Pardon me?
[00:22:38.488 --> 00:22:39.468]  Back to the real world.
[00:22:39.728 --> 00:22:43.691]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[00:22:44.011 --> 00:22:45.972]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:48.020]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:59.005]  Please call me, John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, to discuss investing in precious metals, gold and silver, with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.
[00:22:59.705 --> 00:23:06.708]  I'm John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and together we'll create a package that really works for you.
[00:23:08.809 --> 00:23:09.349]  You worry.
[00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.571]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:12.131]  Hi.
[00:23:12.411 --> 00:23:14.893]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:19.436]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:23:19.736 --> 00:23:21.918]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:23:22.198 --> 00:23:25.260]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.281]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[00:23:27.481 --> 00:23:30.003]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[00:23:30.283 --> 00:23:33.685]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[00:23:34.005 --> 00:23:38.048]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[00:23:38.388 --> 00:23:42.189]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[00:23:42.489 --> 00:23:48.491]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[00:23:48.811 --> 00:23:50.951]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[00:23:51.171 --> 00:23:52.852]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[00:23:53.292 --> 00:23:57.493]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:23:57.933 --> 00:23:58.593]  Start now.
[00:23:58.853 --> 00:23:59.813]  Knowledge is power.
[00:24:00.573 --> 00:24:01.374]  Better take action.
[00:24:01.574 --> 00:24:02.534]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:21.366]  Got David Eich with us for another hour and 35 minutes.
[00:24:22.508 --> 00:24:24.851]  And what David here is talking about is so important.
[00:24:27.042 --> 00:24:43.219]  When you're in a view kind of above yourself, outside the world, realizing that this is a biological earth suit, and that the system knows how to program it with hormones and drugs and war and feedback and sex.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.282]  When they use sex to sell Calvin Klein jeans,
[00:24:48.911 --> 00:24:53.234]  They are going at your primitive sexual centers in your lower brain.
[00:24:53.534 --> 00:24:54.515]  This is all a fact.
[00:24:55.095 --> 00:24:58.998]  And just to get the public to realize they're being bombarded, they're being programmed.
[00:24:59.818 --> 00:25:02.460]  If you can get them to do that, they kind of wake up out of the trance.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.301]  Realize you're being bombarded.
[00:25:04.601 --> 00:25:05.822]  Realize there's a game.
[00:25:05.842 --> 00:25:13.107]  I mean, I don't know how to quantify this, David, but, you know, to me, you talk about being outside, you know, of the body consciousness or whatever.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:20.364]  I mean, to me, the term I would use is just realize that you are being bombarded with data.
[00:25:20.404 --> 00:25:25.007]  Realize that there is a manipulation going on, knowing it's half the battle.
[00:25:25.658 --> 00:25:26.859]  Well, see, this is so important.
[00:25:26.899 --> 00:25:27.779]  I'll give you an example.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:34.684]  In my talks, I put some pictures on the screen, which are subliminal advertisements.
[00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:42.049]  And most people, the vast majority of people, can't see them because that's what subliminal is, below threshold.
[00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:48.653]  The conscious mind doesn't see them, which the conscious mind actually sees very little compared with what actually is in front of it.
[00:25:49.173 --> 00:25:54.617]  The subconscious mind, however, picks it all up and affects the person's reality without them realizing it by
[00:25:55.137 --> 00:25:55.558]  That's good.
[00:26:16.917 --> 00:26:18.738]  This is why this area is so important.
[00:26:19.498 --> 00:26:33.584]  When people start to realize how it's being done to them, then they bring it from below threshold, subliminal, to the conscious awareness, and the defenses go up, which they don't have to think about.
[00:26:33.844 --> 00:26:38.446]  Naturally, the defense is up once the conscious mind is aware of the game it's involved in.
[00:26:39.126 --> 00:26:48.512]  And we need to understand the fundamental significance to the whole conspiracy of something called the reptilian brain.
[00:26:49.252 --> 00:26:55.596]  The reptilian brain is where we get, along with other parts of the brain, but massively the reptilian brain, our survival instincts.
[00:26:56.196 --> 00:26:58.057]  The reptilian brain is basically stupid.
[00:26:58.759 --> 00:26:59.780]  David, let me stop you.
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.342]  This is not debatable about the reptilian brain.
[00:27:02.362 --> 00:27:03.903]  This is a scientific name.
[00:27:03.923 --> 00:27:05.204]  In fact, put it up on the screen.
[00:27:05.244 --> 00:27:08.826]  Google reptilian brain and show them like a textbook area.
[00:27:08.847 --> 00:27:14.050]  That's the lower brain that's breathing, sex, eating, wanting to kill people.
[00:27:15.111 --> 00:27:21.455]  I'm just interrupting you because some may think, oh, this is David Icke and his other issues with that.
[00:27:22.736 --> 00:27:32.499]  No, no, scientists call it the R-complex or the reptilian brain because the way it functions and the way it reacts is almost exactly like the brain of a reptile or a lizard.
[00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:33.459]  But it is!
[00:27:33.479 --> 00:27:43.442]  I mean, in fact, students, gives my dad went to medical school, students shown a salt crocodile brain can't tell the difference with a human lower brain.
[00:27:44.222 --> 00:27:46.883]  We basically do have a salt crocodile brain.
[00:27:46.903 --> 00:27:47.123]  Go ahead.
[00:27:47.483 --> 00:28:09.163]  Yeah, and what happens is that those behind the dark suits, those in the shadows, who understand all this stuff and have worked constantly for centuries to take it out of circulation among the people, so they're in ignorance of the very means through which they're being manipulated, they understand this and they target
[00:28:09.824 --> 00:28:10.624]  The reptilian brain.
[00:28:10.865 --> 00:28:12.825]  The reptilian brain is basically stupid.
[00:28:12.905 --> 00:28:14.106]  It's a reaction system.
[00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:17.347]  It is so computer-like, it's incredible.
[00:28:17.687 --> 00:28:20.969]  At that level, the brain does just react.
[00:28:21.745 --> 00:28:23.366]  Uh, like a computer on the desktop.
[00:28:23.666 --> 00:28:25.826]  And it doesn't learn from experience.
[00:28:26.486 --> 00:28:29.047]  Other parts of the brain learn from experience.
[00:28:29.807 --> 00:28:30.968]  The reptilian brain doesn't.
[00:28:31.168 --> 00:28:33.328]  Its survival instincts are total.
[00:28:33.368 --> 00:28:39.870]  It's constantly scanning the environment, looking for possible dangers as it perceives them.
[00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:47.012]  The idea of the manipulation is to give the reptilian brain more and more and more reasons
[00:28:47.842 --> 00:28:48.723]  We're good to go.
[00:29:12.074 --> 00:29:12.975]  Thank you very much.
[00:29:28.477 --> 00:29:29.438]  It's all about survival.
[00:29:29.458 --> 00:29:36.584]  So it perceives the need for sexual reproduction as part of its survival.
[00:29:36.624 --> 00:29:37.525]  That's understandable.
[00:29:37.745 --> 00:29:43.430]  But also, it sees in the world that we live in, money as fundamental to its survival.
[00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:50.076]  So the whole money issues that people have, the fear of not having money, the wanting more... Stay there, this is key.
[00:29:50.196 --> 00:29:50.976]  Sex and money.
[00:29:50.996 --> 00:29:52.157]  All of it.
[00:29:52.498 --> 00:29:53.158]  Key information.
[00:29:53.198 --> 00:29:54.920]  Long segment coming up.

[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:55.940]  We'll come back.
[00:29:56.681 --> 00:29:58.302]  With the master plan.
[00:29:58.342 --> 00:29:58.682]  Stay with us.
[00:29:58.702 --> 00:29:59.543]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.043 --> 00:30:01.664]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.584 --> 00:30:05.266]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:09.615 --> 00:31:11.716]  A New World Order.
[00:31:12.436 --> 00:31:17.078]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:17.298 --> 00:31:20.119]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:22.380]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:31:22.941 --> 00:31:25.382]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:26.122 --> 00:31:33.445]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:36.468 --> 00:31:41.431]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:41.912 --> 00:31:45.394]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:45.774 --> 00:31:48.256]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:48.356 --> 00:31:49.497]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:49.517 --> 00:31:50.257]  They're not after money.
[00:31:50.277 --> 00:31:51.378]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:51.578 --> 00:31:52.279]  They're after power.
[00:31:52.339 --> 00:31:53.399]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:32:07.142 --> 00:32:14.127]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:32:14.347 --> 00:32:18.650]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:24.013]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:32:24.514 --> 00:32:31.618]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:32:32.059 --> 00:32:36.942]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:42.865]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:32:43.245 --> 00:32:48.768]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[00:33:19.122 --> 00:33:22.365]  There's a man going around taking names.
[00:33:23.866 --> 00:33:27.149]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[00:33:29.491 --> 00:33:32.294]  Everybody will be treated all the same.
[00:33:34.135 --> 00:33:37.058]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[00:33:37.078 --> 00:33:39.540]  You know what Revelation talks about?
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.904]  How the kings of the earth traffic in the souls of men.
[00:33:45.817 --> 00:33:53.544]  And, you know, you read the old fables, and it describes kingdoms that were under spells, where they couldn't see corruption, couldn't see lies.
[00:33:53.564 --> 00:33:58.288]  And once you've committed to lies, little lies, then you start buying into the bigger ones.
[00:33:58.368 --> 00:33:59.309]  Torture's okay.
[00:33:59.389 --> 00:34:00.710]  Secret arrest is okay.
[00:34:01.431 --> 00:34:04.373]  You know, we're the good guys, but we're a country that loves death and destruction.
[00:34:05.154 --> 00:34:09.878]  And when you read the psychologists, the psychologists, the
[00:34:12.227 --> 00:34:21.761]  The sociologist, the anthropologist, the psychiatrist, the Edward Bernays 80-90 years ago, they all brag how we're dumb slaves.
[00:34:21.781 --> 00:34:27.470]  They all brag how they're programming us, how they're manipulating us, how they control everything we do.
[00:34:28.231 --> 00:34:40.056]  They're on incredible power trips, and they put on this fake liberal facade, but they're a bunch of cold-blooded trash breaking up the family, all their major textbooks that we've shown you here say the family's their enemy.
[00:34:40.336 --> 00:34:44.078]  You know, and people say, oh, they want to break the family up, or oh, they want to dumb us down.
[00:34:44.498 --> 00:34:46.959]  That isn't just a figment of imagination.
[00:34:46.999 --> 00:34:52.462]  That's not just a statement or a verbal fancy.
[00:34:54.557 --> 00:34:55.438]  It's the reality.
[00:34:56.219 --> 00:35:03.768]  And it's a group of humans setting up a predatory system where they engage in their predator hunting mode against their own people.
[00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:07.613]  And they're breeding us and dumbing us down to be more easily controlled.
[00:35:07.633 --> 00:35:08.755]  That's what David Icke is talking about.
[00:35:08.795 --> 00:35:11.157]  I just took two years of RTF.
[00:35:11.678 --> 00:35:12.559]  Radio, television, film.
[00:35:12.579 --> 00:35:25.393]  The first textbook was all about subliminal messages on radio 80 years ago, and TV 60 years ago, and in movie theaters, and how the billboards have it, and how they use sex to sell, and how they're hitting the reptilian brain.
[00:35:26.013 --> 00:35:30.698]  This is a fact, and so they're feeding through this virtual matrix
[00:35:31.539 --> 00:35:32.239]  And that's what it is.
[00:35:32.579 --> 00:35:34.760]  It's not a physical matrix with us in tanks.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:48.523]  It's our brain in a tank, inside this body suit, being programmed by the false world, by the image makers of television in Madison Avenue, to keep us off the real world and the whole universe around us.
[00:35:48.843 --> 00:35:53.024]  Through fear, through the desire for money, sex, survival, all of this.
[00:35:53.344 --> 00:35:57.705]  But when you do what Christ said and turn loose, he that gives up his life gains his life.
[00:35:57.745 --> 00:35:59.105]  He that tries to save it loses it.
[00:36:00.421 --> 00:36:08.024]  That means when you're ready to give it all up and just don't care anymore and stop letting that program totally control you, then you go to the next level.
[00:36:08.224 --> 00:36:21.009]  And that doesn't mean we don't bounce back and forth between the higher mind, the cerebral cortex, where they say the cognitive and the soul's dwelling, and if you don't believe that, fine, that's your issue, and the animal brain.
[00:36:21.269 --> 00:36:22.430]  Regardless, through this
[00:36:23.874 --> 00:36:51.546]  Electrochemical computer, we are being programmed and manipulated, and the establishment brags about it, and they put compulsions and mental blocks in you, through culture, through television, through the jokes they make on TV, that then are repeated by people on the ground, giving it reality, in this plane of existence, not in the cyber world, the make-believe TV world, that's now becoming reality, that it's not kosher to talk about these things, and so people are in a prison for their mind.
[00:36:51.586 --> 00:36:52.667]  David Icke, please continue.
[00:36:53.988 --> 00:37:05.935]  I've been talking now, I've got a piece of paper in front of me and I've just been ticking off little things, issues that you brought up and they come under one heading, reptilian brain.
[00:37:06.896 --> 00:37:10.238]  From the reptilian brain we get all the survival mechanisms, yes, for which
[00:37:11.158 --> 00:37:12.159]  I think we're good to go.
[00:37:35.831 --> 00:37:38.512]  Of course, a big time into their satanic rituals.
[00:37:38.572 --> 00:37:47.414]  But if you look at human society, Alex, it's just a daily repeating of ritual repeating behavior.
[00:37:47.834 --> 00:37:52.656]  The reptilian brain, we get the desire for top down hierarchical structures of power.
[00:37:52.696 --> 00:37:53.536]  Look at the world.
[00:37:54.396 --> 00:37:57.097]  It's an expression of the reptilian brain.
[00:37:57.337 --> 00:38:00.178]  You were talking there about addictions.
[00:38:00.218 --> 00:38:02.939]  Well, addictions come from the reptilian brain.
[00:38:03.019 --> 00:38:06.440]  Addiction to money, addiction to sex, addiction to drugs.
[00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:07.741]  And then you look at the
[00:38:08.932 --> 00:38:13.495]  Uh, the survival mechanisms and how they play out through problem reaction solution.
[00:38:13.955 --> 00:38:20.159]  When they say, oh, swine flu, pandemic, what are they saying that to?
[00:38:20.519 --> 00:38:28.824]  They're saying it to the survival responses in the reptilian brain of, oh my god, survival, do something, yes, compulsory vaccination, yes, anything.
[00:38:29.304 --> 00:38:29.965]  Terrorism.
[00:38:30.065 --> 00:38:31.205]  Oh yes, war on terror.
[00:38:32.066 --> 00:38:33.207]  Weapons of mass destruction.
[00:38:33.227 --> 00:38:34.067]  Yes, invade Iraq.
[00:38:34.167 --> 00:38:34.888]  Oh yes, anything.
[00:38:34.948 --> 00:38:35.468]  Oh my God.
[00:38:35.728 --> 00:38:47.776]  It's all through the reptilian brain because they understand how it works and we need to understand how it works because once we do that, the defense mechanisms start to go up and also we can start to observe our own behavior.
[00:38:48.156 --> 00:38:56.141]  When we're reacting to things in an emotional way without calm thinking, then
[00:38:57.014 --> 00:38:57.854]  We can stop.
[00:38:57.894 --> 00:39:01.115]  I mean, I've been working on this for years now in myself.
[00:39:01.455 --> 00:39:06.616]  You get halfway through a sentence and you stop and you think, no, that's the reptilian brain being activated.
[00:39:06.916 --> 00:39:21.139]  And what you're doing as you do that, as you recognize it, is you're stopping it having that reactive power over you that it had before, and you move into other parts of the brain in terms of the way that you filter reality and information and
[00:39:22.457 --> 00:39:24.178]  And those get more developed.
[00:39:24.198 --> 00:39:32.460]  You start seeing the universe more and more through the higher levels of the brain, and then knowledge just explosively opens where you can't even describe it.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:41.562]  Well, how can you accumulate real knowledge and awareness when you're spending the day reacting emotionally all the time?
[00:39:41.982 --> 00:39:47.363]  And I would say to people, because I'm not sitting cross-legged on a mountain here saying, hey, I'm the Buddha.
[00:39:47.463 --> 00:39:49.524]  I'm telling you all how it is, and I'm perfect.
[00:39:49.964 --> 00:39:54.146]  We all are in these biological computers.
[00:39:54.346 --> 00:39:58.388]  The question is, are we going to let them live us, or are we going to live them?
[00:39:58.448 --> 00:40:01.069]  Are we going to live life, or are we going to allow life to live us?
[00:40:01.089 --> 00:40:04.910]  Because most people allow life to live them because of these reactive processes.
[00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:07.391]  Well, that's what John Carpenter is saying.
[00:40:08.732 --> 00:40:11.114]  They live, the controllers, we sleep.
[00:40:11.595 --> 00:40:15.659]  We're sleeping when we're in the reptilian brain, also tied into sleep.
[00:40:16.099 --> 00:40:17.360]  We are unconscious.
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.421]  We're really dead.
[00:40:18.982 --> 00:40:19.822]  And they live.
[00:40:19.882 --> 00:40:21.264]  It's all a big joke to them.
[00:40:22.165 --> 00:40:50.965]  Yeah, and if we can start to take control of our reactions, and when you kind of come from this point of view, and you just observe yourself for a few days, just observe yourself and the way you react, and you'll see how many conflicts between individuals, arguments, emotional responses that are right over the top, and the way that we immediately react to something instead of saying, hold on a second,
[00:40:51.972 --> 00:40:52.873]  Take a deep breath.
[00:40:52.913 --> 00:40:55.655]  Let's just calmly look at this before we start making instant decisions.
[00:40:56.515 --> 00:41:03.740]  When you do that, you realize how many times a day the reptilian brain decides your decisions for you.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.482]  It's unbelievable the number of times it happens.
[00:41:06.542 --> 00:41:19.090]  And collectively, of course, there's a collective version of this where you have the mob rule and all the rest of it, where the reptilian brain is manipulated collectively to have a collective response and emotional reaction.
[00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.692]  And we've got to get control of the computer system.
[00:41:22.072 --> 00:41:23.033]  Alright, let me expand on that.
[00:41:41.462 --> 00:41:55.761]  Because it's been scientifically proven, as you know, but for listeners who may not, by thousands of universities for over a hundred years, that mice and other animals know when a hurricane or an earthquake is coming days or sometimes weeks beforehand
[00:41:56.502 --> 00:42:24.863]  They can also do double-blind studies where there's a 20-foot wall, you can't hear what's going on in the next room, but if people are agitated in the next room or being hurt, brainwaves, you know, go into a pattern of disarray or being upset yourself, kind of that hundredth monkey, and the system is trying to suppress this awakening, or, you know, I mean, just in scientific terms, from people being, you know, on a higher level,
[00:42:26.621 --> 00:42:28.022]  When it comes to the use of their brain.
[00:42:28.442 --> 00:42:34.165]  So, that's why they're putting the fluoride in the water, that's why they're injecting us with mercury, that's why they're feeding us the GMO food.
[00:42:34.946 --> 00:42:39.708]  All of this, that's why the television's dumbing everything down, lowering everything down.
[00:42:41.289 --> 00:42:44.911]  How do you see this battle shaking out, David Icke?
[00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:57.398]  Well, if we don't become conscious and get out of control by computer programs, then it's going to go on, because the computer programs are going to keep following the program.
[00:42:57.818 --> 00:43:09.981]  This is why it's so important that no matter what our religious or non-religious or belief or anything, that we put that aside and look at the things that unite us instead of those that divide us.
[00:43:10.001 --> 00:43:12.381]  And like I said a few minutes ago, Alex, you know, we have a
[00:43:12.421 --> 00:43:21.869]  All these religions who argue and cuss and fight, but when you get to the core of them, the real core of them, they're not a million miles from what I'm talking about here.
[00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.312]  If you get it down to the, you know, people can argue about the detail.
[00:43:25.373 --> 00:43:27.174]  I don't see why we should argue about the detail.
[00:43:27.194 --> 00:43:29.696]  I mean, you know, believe what you like so long as you don't enforce it on anyone else.
[00:43:29.776 --> 00:43:37.563]  But, you know, the basics of we are something beyond the body, and when the body dies, that something leaves, which I call awareness.
[00:43:37.603 --> 00:43:38.524]  Other people call the soul.
[00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:52.824]  If we can start to get down to these levels where we all basically agree, then we can start working together without letting the fault lines of detail and religious dogma divide us.
[00:43:53.084 --> 00:43:57.767]  And we need to move our point of observation from the body, instead of looking in the mirror.
[00:43:58.732 --> 00:43:59.213]  I don't know.
[00:44:14.114 --> 00:44:20.719]  You can have a name without actually being completely controlled by the fact that that's who you are.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.682]  See, I don't consider myself to be David Icke.
[00:44:23.702 --> 00:44:27.004]  That's the name of an experience I'm having now at this time.
[00:44:27.505 --> 00:44:29.846]  I am consciousness having that experience.
[00:44:30.307 --> 00:44:35.851]  And when you come from that point of view, you don't get pulled into little me.
[00:44:36.351 --> 00:44:39.974]  In other words, you don't get pulled into computer level of perception.
[00:44:39.994 --> 00:44:40.234]  That's it!
[00:44:40.275 --> 00:44:41.035]  I've got to stop you!
[00:44:41.155 --> 00:44:41.796]  Exactly!
[00:44:43.393 --> 00:44:48.977]  Whenever I'm calm, focused, I can think a thousand times faster, everything makes complete sense.
[00:44:49.297 --> 00:45:08.649]  By the very nature of getting on the air, having the lights on, having the stress of having to perform, I shift in to the, you know, fight or flight, into the reptilian brain, and then lose so much of my consciousness just even when I get on air, instead of like at 10 or 11, 12 at night, when everything is so clear.
[00:45:10.751 --> 00:45:19.099]  It's just amazing, but you know, what you just talked about, whenever I get above it all, then I don't hate my enemies that are attacking me and lying about me.
[00:45:19.119 --> 00:45:21.981]  I actually feel sorry for them and wish that they weren't.
[00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:25.712]  You know, it's such a primitive level.
[00:45:26.132 --> 00:45:38.079]  But then I also realize we can't do like some people in the East that get so into higher awareness that they stop caring even if their body's dying or they're sitting there homeless under a tree.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.262]  We have to have balance between the two levels because
[00:45:44.495 --> 00:45:53.406]  If people lose the will to even survive at this plane of existence, then that I see also as a great danger.
[00:45:53.446 --> 00:45:54.067]  Here's an example.
[00:45:54.367 --> 00:45:56.550]  You spray cockroaches with poison.
[00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.652]  Any exterminator will tell you this.
[00:45:59.393 --> 00:46:01.516]  As soon as they get hit by poison, they start having sex.
[00:46:04.485 --> 00:46:05.586]  To fertilize their eggs.
[00:46:06.246 --> 00:46:09.149]  And it's just like after 9-11, there was a huge baby boom.
[00:46:09.469 --> 00:46:13.873]  That was, the establishment did a threat to the species grand event.
[00:46:13.973 --> 00:46:15.634]  Oh, our tribe just got devastated.
[00:46:15.915 --> 00:46:20.538]  People immediately, myself included, went and got married, started having children, not even knowing why.
[00:46:20.558 --> 00:46:25.903]  It was a compulsion of the species, which are all interconnected and tied together, you know.
[00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:30.647]  We're all individuals, but we're also part of a hive species, almost like a jellyfish colony.
[00:46:31.227 --> 00:46:31.688]  And so,
[00:46:33.154 --> 00:46:35.375]  I mean, David, I'm throwing out a lot of ideas here.
[00:46:35.415 --> 00:46:53.722]  The point I'm trying to make is that we can also, and I haven't done this consciously, but now that I'm more conscious I can realize I did, I've been successful with people waking them up to the first level because I did at a reptilian primitive level explain you have been enslaved.
[00:46:53.922 --> 00:46:56.783]  There is more outside this system than you know.
[00:46:57.443 --> 00:47:17.060]  But then now more and more I realize that when you do open up the entire universe and the majesty of the clouds and the stars and life and that your soul is looking out these windows and when I look at another person I'm looking at another soul and their entire genetic line and all those levels almost like a symbiotic organism is what I'm beginning to realize we are.
[00:47:20.063 --> 00:47:23.065]  It's so incredible to open up to the entire universe, and I agree with you.
[00:47:23.085 --> 00:47:27.108]  When you open up to that, then you realize how ridiculous the New World Order is.
[00:47:27.168 --> 00:47:39.636]  But still, they are physically at this level hurting people, and it's a test for the higher level to come down into the lower level and deal with this, because almost when you get tied into the higher level, you don't even want to be part of the world anymore.
[00:47:39.816 --> 00:47:45.200]  But it's almost like God sending Christ down to the earth to experience this in the flesh.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:46.961]  So, do you understand what I'm saying, David?
[00:47:47.799 --> 00:47:51.340]  Well, you know, I don't think we come into this world to then ignore the fact we've done so.
[00:47:51.481 --> 00:47:53.241]  This is why we need the balance.
[00:47:53.821 --> 00:48:06.467]  You've got people like what's called the New Age Movement, and much of that was brilliantly described in a book I read a long time ago as people who were in a holding pattern above the airport refusing to land.
[00:48:07.047 --> 00:48:14.310]  And there's a lot of people that are in denial of what
[00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.531]  Thank you very much.
[00:48:25.075 --> 00:48:29.738]  What we need to do is bring that higher awareness into the body computer.
[00:48:30.399 --> 00:48:39.926]  You know, they can manipulate and program the body computer through the media, through education, through electrochemical means, and they do all the time.
[00:48:39.966 --> 00:48:40.987]  That's the bottom line.
[00:48:41.007 --> 00:48:47.592]  So we have to occupy the reptilian brain with the higher consciousness, or they're always going to use it as a breach.
[00:48:47.952 --> 00:48:56.061]  The point I'm making here, Alex, is we can program the computer from consciousness, if consciousness is allowed in.
[00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:57.062]  And what does that mean?
[00:48:57.322 --> 00:48:58.543]  It means opening the mind.
[00:48:58.563 --> 00:49:07.693]  A key thing I would say is that, from the words that I, the terms I'm using anyway, the mind and consciousness are not the same thing.
[00:49:08.134 --> 00:49:09.175]  The mind is like a
[00:49:10.985 --> 00:49:12.367]  It's like an interface.
[00:49:12.787 --> 00:49:18.493]  You see, I'm sitting here now in an office, and if I want to go on the internet, I can't just go on the internet.
[00:49:18.593 --> 00:49:21.056]  I've got to go on the internet through a computer.
[00:49:21.616 --> 00:49:22.677]  That's my interface.
[00:49:22.717 --> 00:49:26.722]  That allows me to experience the collective reality we call the World Wide Web.
[00:49:27.302 --> 00:49:37.090]  However, when I'm a consciousness, soul, whatever you want to talk about it, and I want to experience and make a contribution to this reality, I need an interface.
[00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:38.691]  And that interface is mind.
[00:49:39.091 --> 00:49:43.675]  And the mind is fundamentally part of the body-computer system, body-mind.
[00:49:43.715 --> 00:49:45.616]  They are different facets of each other.
[00:49:46.177 --> 00:49:50.800]  And what the Illuminati are about is programming the mind.
[00:49:51.101 --> 00:49:53.262]  And you talked earlier about
[00:49:55.171 --> 00:50:11.961]  The way that people are using fewer and fewer words and are speaking slower and all the rest of it, this is all part of programming people's not just ability to express themselves in words, but their ability to express even their thoughts.
[00:50:12.521 --> 00:50:18.202]  See, on the level of consciousness, we become aware through something called knowing.
[00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:19.603]  Don't think it, know it.
[00:50:19.663 --> 00:50:24.904]  Consciousness knows because it is the one consciousness, the all that is.
[00:50:25.424 --> 00:50:29.925]  The mind, the body-mind-computer system, that thinks.
[00:50:30.025 --> 00:50:37.367]  That's the blooming chatter that goes on in your head 24-7 and never shuts up and says stupid things.
[00:50:37.387 --> 00:50:38.607]  And you think, why am I thinking that?
[00:50:38.627 --> 00:50:39.787]  Well, you're not actually thinking it.
[00:50:39.807 --> 00:50:40.728]  The body-computer is.
[00:50:42.128 --> 00:50:44.809]  That is, it thinks in words.
[00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:46.249]  It, you know, think now.
[00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:48.650]  Anybody listen to this show and you're thinking in words.
[00:50:49.070 --> 00:51:00.594]  The more you remove words, generation after generation, detailed words that can express a real detailed thought, you're, you're removing the ability even to think in detail.
[00:51:01.134 --> 00:51:05.515]  Because these are symbols used in the brain to construct that mental image.
[00:51:05.535 --> 00:51:06.756]  We'll be right back with David Icke.
[00:51:06.776 --> 00:51:07.936]  Pretty powerful stuff.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.102]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:51:12.242 --> 00:51:17.444]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:51:17.644 --> 00:51:22.406]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:51:22.606 --> 00:51:33.571]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:51:33.851 --> 00:51:39.433]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[00:51:39.613 --> 00:51:45.676]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:46.476]  What about you?
[00:51:46.696 --> 00:51:48.597]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[00:51:48.617 --> 00:51:52.739]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[00:51:52.919 --> 00:51:54.920]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:55.320]  That's right.
[00:52:08.584 --> 00:52:09.926]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:10.106 --> 00:52:15.092]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[00:52:15.472 --> 00:52:17.554]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[00:52:17.895 --> 00:52:24.843]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by
[00:52:25.984 --> 00:52:26.364]  We're good to go.
[00:52:47.503 --> 00:52:52.849]  The call is free and in 10 minutes they will show you how much you can save right over the phone with one simple call.
[00:52:53.089 --> 00:52:55.272]  Let the bailout group bail you out of debt.
[00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:59.757]  Reduce your payments by up to 60% and save you thousands of dollars today.
[00:52:59.977 --> 00:53:00.918]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554.
[00:53:00.938 --> 00:53:00.998]  800-324-6554.
[00:53:01.018 --> 00:53:01.479]  The bailout group.
[00:53:08.553 --> 00:53:10.755]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[00:53:10.915 --> 00:53:20.021]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[00:53:20.421 --> 00:53:28.246]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[00:53:28.427 --> 00:53:34.371]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[00:53:35.231 --> 00:53:35.632]  We're good.
[00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:56.430]  Keeping the IRS off your back and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[00:53:56.811 --> 00:54:00.952]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[00:54:00.972 --> 00:54:01.232]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[00:54:01.252 --> 00:54:01.672]  Call today.
[00:54:02.012 --> 00:54:03.593]  It's always amazing having David Aikman.
[00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:22.072]  During the break, we're having an amazing behind-the-scenes discussion.
[00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:23.432]  Perhaps we can relay that.
[00:54:24.113 --> 00:54:26.975]  Coming up in the next hour, we'll open the phones up specifically for David Icke.
[00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:36.135]  I want to respect our guests, so if you're calling about something else, please call another day.
[00:54:36.155 --> 00:54:36.835]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:36.855 --> 00:54:37.055]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:37.075 --> 00:54:48.102]  I hope folks will go to InfoWars.com and support the broadcast by purchasing books and videos from the online store so that we can continue the fight to unlock minds and get people to think for themselves.
[00:54:48.563 --> 00:54:50.324]  All I want to do is take blinders off people.
[00:54:50.444 --> 00:54:51.965]  I don't claim they're going to see what I see.
[00:54:52.585 --> 00:54:53.926]  I don't claim I have all the answers.
[00:54:53.986 --> 00:54:54.687]  I just know this.
[00:54:55.527 --> 00:54:58.675]  Consciousness, this universe, is unbelievable!
[00:54:59.336 --> 00:55:01.200]  I mean, I just literally commune with it.
[00:55:01.241 --> 00:55:04.568]  It is so... Every moment is exhilarating and it's torture!
[00:55:05.782 --> 00:55:11.966]  To be here and to have to focus on the New World Order and deal with it, but at the same time, we are never going to defeat these people.
[00:55:12.026 --> 00:55:19.711]  As David said during the break to me, he said, Alex, we've got to go into this world, we've got to be of this world, in the world but not of it.
[00:55:20.371 --> 00:55:24.394]  And we've got to be able to be in this world, be able to get people by the hand and pull them out of it.
[00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:25.854]  And does that mean we're perfect?
[00:55:25.915 --> 00:55:26.095]  No!
[00:55:26.835 --> 00:55:28.777]  We're just aware there's something else.
[00:55:29.317 --> 00:55:31.078]  And as I said, knowing is half the battle.
[00:55:31.359 --> 00:55:33.520]  But don't forget the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:40.466]  If you want to get The Obama Deception, if you want to get Truth Rising or any of the books and films we carry, InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:55:40.866 --> 00:55:45.150]  Be sure and peruse that while you're at it.
[00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.452]  Also folks, you can peruse DavidIke.com.
[00:55:47.612 --> 00:55:54.958]  A lot of really interesting, mind-blowing stuff from one of the great philosophers and minds of our day, David Ike.
[00:55:55.478 --> 00:55:56.459]  Yeah, well, my journey is...
[00:56:10.718 --> 00:56:34.495]  Over the last 20 years has, you know, gone through so many levels with all the five cents manipulation of engineered wars and banking scams and all the rest of it and then into deeper areas and there's come a point, you know, every day at the moment is a joy as I'm writing this because the insights are just coming so fast because you reach a point where
[00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:54.993]  So many dots start to connect on all these different levels and you start to see how deep the rabbit hole really goes and what's good about it is it's not just that it shows you how they manipulate us, it shows you how we can stop them manipulating us and how we can take power over our reality back.
[00:56:55.713 --> 00:56:55.773]  I'm
[00:57:14.344 --> 00:57:17.045]  The Illuminati is not like a fly on the elephant's back.
[00:57:17.386 --> 00:57:23.369]  So we let consciousness in by opening our minds, and bingo, things start to change massively.
[00:57:23.409 --> 00:57:24.449]  The world starts to change.
[00:57:24.669 --> 00:57:26.650]  Because the world is a reflection of us.
[00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:37.996]  And at the moment, because we constantly give our power away, we constantly think in terms of little me, we live in a world in which the mass of the population constantly has no power and sees itself as little me.
[00:57:38.376 --> 00:57:40.417]  When we change that self-perception,
[00:57:41.169 --> 00:57:41.369]  Absolutely.
[00:58:03.032 --> 00:58:10.557]  I don't believe that we are in a physical matrix, living in little tanks with, you know, reptoid robots running around all over us.
[00:58:11.017 --> 00:58:21.044]  But that came from 1968 government documents declassified in 2000, and clearly those movies came out before that, and so they were having the information fed to them.
[00:58:21.424 --> 00:58:23.805]  That is what the Pentagon says they want to build.
[00:58:24.146 --> 00:58:30.370]  Because for a control freak, somebody from the reptilian level, if everybody is encased in styrofoam for their own safety,
[00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:37.334]  Having perception fed to them through a wire, then that's not tyranny, that's just another reality.
[00:58:38.654 --> 00:58:41.116]  So I want to elaborate on this idea when we come back.
[00:58:41.396 --> 00:58:41.616]  Okay.
[00:58:42.416 --> 00:58:46.319]  Whereas we are in a matrix in that our brain is receiving all this.
[00:58:46.339 --> 00:58:46.819]  Stay with us.
[00:58:50.041 --> 00:58:52.122]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:06.827]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:59:07.247 --> 00:59:11.971]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[00:59:12.431 --> 00:59:14.993]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[00:59:15.413 --> 00:59:17.034]  Actually results in disease.

[01:00:01.079 --> 01:00:03.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:03.481 --> 01:00:06.263]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.144 --> 01:00:18.705]  What are you?
[01:00:19.705 --> 01:00:25.930]  You are a species that lives on a planet two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of what we call the Milky Way Galaxy.
[01:00:26.911 --> 01:00:34.637]  We're on a now eight planet, they don't count Pluto, but a nine planet solar system orbiting a very average sun.
[01:00:37.419 --> 01:00:40.942]  And what we know of our history probably has no reflection to the truth.
[01:00:44.551 --> 01:00:49.433]  We have a sense of ourselves as very important and of having an ancient history.
[01:00:50.674 --> 01:00:59.518]  We have a, you know, they call it delusions of grandeur, but really it's a sense of wonderment as being part of an infinite universe.
[01:01:00.118 --> 01:01:01.859]  And they want to narrow our perception.
[01:01:01.879 --> 01:01:05.120]  They want to keep us small and focused and fearful and petty.
[01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:12.024]  Because then when we're focused in on that, we don't see the wider universe and we're basically in change.
[01:01:13.564 --> 01:01:14.424]  I'm sure David's seen these.
[01:01:14.444 --> 01:01:18.806]  It's in my book, Descent into Tyranny, but I know he's seen thousands of documents and articles.
[01:01:18.846 --> 01:01:21.187]  I mentioned a few stories to him during a break and he was aware of all of them.
[01:01:21.207 --> 01:01:22.127]  We're going to talk about later.
[01:01:24.108 --> 01:01:35.653]  Dealing with why he can't really go to Canada and why I can't, but side issue, trying to bring in this physical tyranny so they can bring in the drug tyranny, the brainwashing tyranny to affect the mind that's really in the prison.
[01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:39.252]  So they're bringing in a physical prism but also a mental prism.
[01:01:39.272 --> 01:01:55.865]  But David, we really are in a matrix of perception when we realize it is a brain with all these multifaceted layers and that our eyes are just brain stems looking out at this small spectrum of reality as you say and others say.
[01:01:56.966 --> 01:01:58.627]  And so it's competing matrices.
[01:01:58.707 --> 01:02:04.550]  Either we take control of the matrix, or the establishment takes control of the matrix.
[01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:08.012]  And because we've not been aware of the matrix, they are in control of it.
[01:02:08.072 --> 01:02:08.812]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:02:09.432 --> 01:02:11.754]  Well, what I would say is this.
[01:02:11.814 --> 01:02:20.398]  You know, there's been many scientists over the years who've speculated that this reality needs an observer to be as we perceive it.
[01:02:21.327 --> 01:02:25.431]  And I would say they were absolutely right and the evidence is overwhelming that that's true.
[01:02:27.313 --> 01:02:39.264]  If you think of radio stations and television stations and you tune the radio to a certain station, that's the station you get.
[01:02:40.365 --> 01:02:41.446]  So if you want to control
[01:02:42.233 --> 01:02:54.185]  The sense of perception and the experience and daily life of a symbolic radio, then you need to control what it's tuned to.
[01:02:55.243 --> 01:03:02.907]  And we are constantly receiving and transmitting information through the body computer.
[01:03:02.927 --> 01:03:11.032]  This is why, you know, it's massively a crystalline entity, organism, because it's a receiver-transmitter of information.
[01:03:11.072 --> 01:03:12.833]  The DNA is a receiver-transmitter.
[01:03:13.533 --> 01:03:17.355]  Every cell, and we have trillions of them, have receiver-transmitters.
[01:03:17.615 --> 01:03:18.836]  We're a receiver-transmitter
[01:03:20.502 --> 01:03:21.202]  Extraordinaire.
[01:03:22.223 --> 01:03:30.125]  But, as with the radio, if you can control what it receives, you're controlling what it perceives.
[01:03:30.865 --> 01:03:48.549]  And all the time, we are being bombarded with programs that dictate the way the body computer reads and decodes reality, because this universe that we see as solid and physical only exists in our head when it's decoded.
[01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:57.281]  It's exactly the same principle as playing software on a computer, and it reads the software.
[01:03:57.381 --> 01:04:02.023]  Now, the software has no pictures on it, it has no websites on it, it has no text on it.
[01:04:02.403 --> 01:04:03.423]  It's just information.
[01:04:03.883 --> 01:04:14.927]  But the computer reads that information and projects it on the screen as words, pictures, websites, a collective reality we call the internet or whatever else is on the disc.
[01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:18.857]  And that's what we're doing.
[01:04:19.219 --> 01:04:22.571]  The prime level of this matrix is
[01:04:23.363 --> 01:04:23.963]  We're good to go.
[01:04:51.161 --> 01:04:52.943]  All right, David, stay there.
[01:04:52.983 --> 01:04:53.664]  Got a break.
[01:04:53.684 --> 01:04:54.525]  Long segment coming up.
[01:04:54.545 --> 01:04:55.767]  This is very important information.
[01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:13.606]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[01:05:13.906 --> 01:05:15.068]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:05:15.208 --> 01:05:19.151]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[01:05:19.472 --> 01:05:21.033]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:05:21.333 --> 01:05:27.639]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.321]  Inner food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:05:31.641 --> 01:05:33.121]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:05:33.382 --> 01:05:37.823]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[01:05:38.103 --> 01:05:40.644]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:05:40.924 --> 01:05:46.806]  Try the NutriCafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:05:47.186 --> 01:05:49.387]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:05:49.587 --> 01:05:51.868]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:53.808]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:05:54.148 --> 01:05:55.929]  Go to www.nutricafe.com.
[01:05:56.169 --> 01:05:56.449]  We're good.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:13.124]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:06:13.324 --> 01:06:17.126]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:17.346 --> 01:06:22.970]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:23.251 --> 01:06:28.114]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:28.314 --> 01:06:28.814]  Number 3.
[01:06:29.234 --> 01:06:34.676]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:06:34.857 --> 01:06:35.077]  Number 4.
[01:06:35.537 --> 01:06:38.178]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:06:38.438 --> 01:06:41.839]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:42.299]  Number 5.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.541]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:06:46.801 --> 01:06:52.287]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:06:52.527 --> 01:06:57.092]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:57.232 --> 01:06:58.773]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:01.336]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[01:07:08.644 --> 01:07:09.124]  Attention!
[01:07:09.304 --> 01:07:24.368]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[01:07:24.668 --> 01:07:25.849]  Micro plant powder is 89%
[01:07:26.769 --> 01:07:27.410]  I think so.
[01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:54.670]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:25.621 --> 01:08:27.182]  Your calls are coming up with David Icke.
[01:08:27.202 --> 01:08:29.243]  He's been very, very nice to give us two hours today.
[01:08:29.263 --> 01:08:29.963]  We're very, very thankful.
[01:08:29.983 --> 01:08:34.605]  We'll tell you about some of the sneaky engagements that are coming up here in just a moment, so get your pen and paper ready.
[01:08:35.065 --> 01:08:37.326]  We're talking to the folks involved with the 2012 film.
[01:08:37.366 --> 01:08:38.207]  That's all I can say.
[01:08:38.227 --> 01:08:43.949]  I'm not even allowed to show the revision numbers of this, but I have the 2012 script with Woody Harrelson.
[01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:45.770]  I will just tell you that.
[01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:46.671]  That just came in the mail.
[01:08:46.691 --> 01:08:47.871]  I want to thank folks for that.
[01:08:48.611 --> 01:08:49.512]  Also want to thank
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:09:02.181]  People for this, Bob in Spokane, Washington said, God bless you Alex Jones, I thought of you and what you do.
[01:09:03.277 --> 01:09:04.237]  The Infowarrior.
[01:09:05.017 --> 01:09:06.258]  I'm an Infowarrior myself.
[01:09:06.838 --> 01:09:08.418]  I hear you talk about the tip of the spear.
[01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:10.379]  This is a real Indian spear.
[01:09:10.919 --> 01:09:12.079]  And I had to give it to you.
[01:09:12.599 --> 01:09:14.879]  May God bless you and your family.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:21.401]  And you can always tell the real ones because of the craftsmanship and the slower way they did it versus the factory made ones.
[01:09:22.001 --> 01:09:25.382]  I don't know how prehistoric this is, but it's got the look of a prehistoric.
[01:09:25.842 --> 01:09:29.703]  My grandfather gave my dad some spearheads much like this.
[01:09:29.763 --> 01:09:30.883]  Very, very valuable gift.
[01:09:30.923 --> 01:09:31.483]  I will put this
[01:09:33.143 --> 01:09:33.544]  in a little
[01:09:51.383 --> 01:09:57.008]  You got cut off there talking about the frequency, talking about how the globalists, the controllers, keep us dialed into one point.
[01:09:57.728 --> 01:10:06.315]  How do you see their New World Order plan, their goals, to build this extermination grid, this planetary government, then carry out the population reduction?
[01:10:06.855 --> 01:10:13.180]  To me, it looks like things aren't going well for them, and we're having victory after victory, and that there's an awakening accelerating.
[01:10:13.641 --> 01:10:18.344]  Now I know that they're going to counter-strike, and things are going to be rough, and we're all going to be tested.
[01:10:19.786 --> 01:10:30.893]  But am I somewhat, in your expert opinion, do you think I'm too close to the fact that we are going to win in the end and that I have a lot of faith because I'm deeper into this?
[01:10:31.413 --> 01:10:38.918]  And is that distorting my vision, in your opinion, that so many others aren't awake yet or are going deeper into the control?
[01:10:39.899 --> 01:10:47.524]  And so I'm skewing my view because I know the New World Order is already lost because they don't control the entire universe.
[01:10:47.564 --> 01:10:48.925]  I mean, do you get the point I'm making?
[01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:58.472]  Yeah, I've never doubted that it would turn out fine in the end, but the nature of the manipulation and the programming
[01:10:59.241 --> 01:11:04.663]  Means that a lot of people have got to go a long way down the road before they actually see it.
[01:11:05.343 --> 01:11:13.085]  And it's a case of how deeply programmed you are before you actually see it and start to realize what's happening.
[01:11:13.605 --> 01:11:21.548]  And what I've seen over the last 20 years is an exponential curve without any question of people who are starting to get it.
[01:11:21.608 --> 01:11:23.969]  They're starting to get it in bigger and bigger and bigger numbers.
[01:11:24.049 --> 01:11:28.050]  And what I find interesting is they're starting to get it at higher levels immediately.
[01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:29.491]  I think?
[01:11:47.509 --> 01:11:57.716]  Name truth vibrations, because it was based on the fact that I was understanding at the time that there was a vibrational change coming that was going to act like an alarm clock.
[01:11:57.796 --> 01:11:58.836]  It was going to wake them up.
[01:11:58.916 --> 01:12:02.018]  It was going to tease open their minds so consciousness could enter.
[01:12:02.479 --> 01:12:06.121]  And at the time, of course, I'm thinking, well, there's no evidence of this whatsoever.
[01:12:06.161 --> 01:12:07.422]  And there wasn't for a few years.
[01:12:08.323 --> 01:12:13.365]  With the turn into the 21st century, I'm seeing it happening more and more and more.
[01:12:13.846 --> 01:12:14.806]  And it needs to happen.
[01:12:14.846 --> 01:12:17.867]  This is the way we're going to turn this around.
[01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:25.451]  But they're going to push it, obviously, as much as they can to get their structure in place.
[01:12:25.491 --> 01:12:29.953]  But I do sense a feeling of increasing panic, because
[01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:34.395]  Every day they take to do it, more and more people are waking up.
[01:12:34.455 --> 01:12:44.079]  And I'm very optimistic, not that there's not going to be some enormous, real big challenges to come, but I'm getting more and more optimistic.
[01:12:44.099 --> 01:12:48.821]  And you know, it's a phrase I use from time to time.
[01:12:49.821 --> 01:12:54.723]  Life tends to give us our greatest gifts brilliantly disguised as our worst nightmares.
[01:12:55.399 --> 01:13:04.862]  You know, sometimes what appears to be our worst nightmare turns out to be our greatest gift, like massive ridicule for me in the early 1990s right up to, you know, almost the year 2000.
[01:13:04.982 --> 01:13:15.045]  I went through incredible ridicule in Britain, but it set me free because it set me free of concern about what people thought of me, which allowed me to open my mind and allow consciousness in.
[01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:17.266]  And some of these challenges, you know,
[01:13:18.237 --> 01:13:19.178]  Which we don't like.
[01:13:19.258 --> 01:13:20.018]  I mean, who does?
[01:13:20.518 --> 01:13:25.121]  Are actually going to wake a lot of people up and set them free.
[01:13:25.361 --> 01:13:31.805]  There's a line in a song which goes, freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.
[01:13:32.305 --> 01:13:38.828]  And you know, when we think we've got something to lose, that reptilian brain survival mechanism is controlling us.
[01:13:38.929 --> 01:13:40.169]  Oh my goodness, yes, anything.
[01:13:40.209 --> 01:13:41.350]  I don't want to lose anything.
[01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:44.793]  But when you lose it, then you go, well, hold on a second.
[01:13:44.813 --> 01:13:46.014]  What have I actually lost?
[01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:46.935]  This is OK.
[01:13:46.995 --> 01:13:47.796]  I can deal with this.
[01:13:48.116 --> 01:13:49.398]  And actually, life's nicer.
[01:13:49.438 --> 01:13:59.768]  And it's funny that people... I talk to so many people who lived through the Second World War in Britain who say life was much nicer during the war, because people were nicer to each other and all the rest of it.
[01:14:00.028 --> 01:14:00.829]  They never had much.
[01:14:01.429 --> 01:14:03.351]  And they were helping each other because they never had much.
[01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:09.298]  In ways that as soon as the war was over, every man for himself, all that stopped, and my goodness me, as it stopped now.
[01:14:09.418 --> 01:14:12.662]  And it also made them enjoy things more because they had less...
[01:14:14.363 --> 01:14:14.663]  I don't know.
[01:14:34.364 --> 01:14:35.725]  Well, there's that.
[01:14:35.745 --> 01:14:52.678]  If we see that, if we experience these challenges from that perspective rather than, oh my god, reptilian brain, then not only are we going to get through them with less pain and all the rest of it, we're actually going to think straight in a way that's going to allow us to get through them in a much more effective way.
[01:14:53.499 --> 01:15:00.444]  Absolutely, and the point I was going to add is that so many people in these pyramidal power structures, and I'd like you to speak to this,
[01:15:01.656 --> 01:15:13.700]  They are just as imprisoned as lowly little minions of the system and more and more I'm talking to people who think of themselves as the elite and they're beginning to realize this is a prison.
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:17.621]  They're beginning to realize they're drinking sodium fluoride, their kids are drinking it.
[01:15:17.901 --> 01:15:28.405]  They're beginning to realize that this system affects everybody and they're beginning to realize that the television and the culture and the dumbing down is taking their children from them and
[01:15:29.765 --> 01:15:31.546]  Destroying their own destiny.
[01:15:32.206 --> 01:15:45.613]  So I'd like you to speak to that and then I want to bring up Rolling Stone Magazine that I just happened to see laying there on the Commons table at the Emmes building where I was doing the Sunday radio show, syndicated show.
[01:15:45.933 --> 01:15:58.700]  I want to break this down what Ray Kurzweil is saying and we've got our vision of the future, liberty, freedom, you know, dynamic human spirit, and a new renaissance, you know, to the power of a trillion versus
[01:15:59.733 --> 01:16:03.677]  Versus their renaissance, a very dark renaissance in their own words.
[01:16:04.338 --> 01:16:08.381]  They just say that it's beautiful, but clearly it's quite ugly.
[01:16:08.702 --> 01:16:10.343]  But I mean, can you speak to the point I just made?
[01:16:11.765 --> 01:16:21.875]  Yeah, this is a point I make as often as I can, because we go back to the sheep policing the herd, the sheep policing themselves.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:36.583]  Because when you're talking about people in full awareness of this agenda and in full support of advancing it, you're talking about a dramatically few people compared with the global population.
[01:16:36.923 --> 01:16:44.965]  You're certainly not looking at enough to administer the institutions of control that we see across global society.
[01:16:45.385 --> 01:16:47.105]  So you need people
[01:16:47.205 --> 01:16:47.865]  We're good to go.
[01:17:17.425 --> 01:17:32.014]  And they're like, who are administering this system, and are welded to it in terms of their subordination to it, or don't rock the boat, or don't step out of line, don't say anything.
[01:17:32.034 --> 01:17:36.056]  They get to dominate those under them, and they get dominated from those above them.
[01:17:36.296 --> 01:17:37.377]  It's a psychosystem.
[01:17:37.577 --> 01:17:38.238]  Yes, it is.
[01:17:38.258 --> 01:17:50.066]  And what we need to do, this is a very important area, is to get those people to actually, again, look around them, take a deep breath, and just look at it again.
[01:17:50.086 --> 01:17:57.172]  And by connecting dots, you can let people who are in those systems realize
[01:17:57.772 --> 01:17:59.112]  We're good to go.
[01:18:25.998 --> 01:18:26.238]  I think?
[01:18:40.999 --> 01:18:41.339]  I don't
[01:19:00.211 --> 01:19:01.491]  Let me throw a point in here, David.
[01:19:02.272 --> 01:19:02.532]  Exactly.
[01:19:02.552 --> 01:19:03.312]  Let me throw a point in.
[01:19:03.352 --> 01:19:19.036]  I mean, to talk about how it's all a facade and all a matrix illusion, look at the world banking system out of fiat currency with a handful of less than 15 families who rule the planet because they bought off governments to say that they issued the backing of the money.
[01:19:19.436 --> 01:19:22.317]  I mean, it's all just a fraud and then out of that,
[01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:32.060]  What they're doing right now economically, trying to bankrupt things, so we have to depend on the state, and have to be under their control, looks like a desperate gamble.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:38.941]  Yeah, we have to say, we have to say, no, we're not building our own prison anymore, and then something fantastic happens.
[01:19:39.182 --> 01:19:44.223]  We stop building our own prison, and the next thing is, the prison isn't being built, and there is no prison.
[01:19:44.283 --> 01:19:50.885]  Look how many people work for the banking system, and administer it, and make it happen, compared with the number of people that own it.
[01:19:50.985 --> 01:19:51.785]  It's fantastic.
[01:19:53.462 --> 01:19:55.365]  David Icke, let's come back and talk about solutions.
[01:19:55.405 --> 01:19:57.527]  Then at the bottom of the hour, start taking phone calls.
[01:19:57.547 --> 01:19:58.749]  I'm also going to get into this.
[01:20:00.591 --> 01:20:03.375]  They say the elite are going to live forever in Rolling Stone.
[01:20:03.515 --> 01:20:05.157]  Oh, I thought I heard that in Endgame.
[01:20:05.538 --> 01:20:07.481]  We'll break it down on FallWaters.com.
[01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:12.432]  Are you concerned about the current strain of influenza spreading across the U.S.?
[01:20:12.712 --> 01:20:17.915]  At the rate this new virus is spreading, it's not a matter of if, but when it will affect each and every American.
[01:20:18.155 --> 01:20:26.399]  This virus is comprised of extracted DNA from the Spanish flu and has combined itself with the bird and swine flu, making it very contagious and deadly.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.500]  The Center for Disease
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:27.860]  I think so.
[01:20:56.861 --> 01:21:02.483]  That's 1-866-644-1933 or visit WholeCure.com.
[01:21:02.623 --> 01:21:05.823]  That's W-H-O-L-E-Cure.com.
[01:21:06.044 --> 01:21:07.864]  WholeCure.com today.
[01:21:07.884 --> 01:21:10.245]  It is a big idea.
[01:21:10.265 --> 01:21:12.365]  A new world order.
[01:21:13.065 --> 01:21:17.327]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:21:17.967 --> 01:21:20.748]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:20.788 --> 01:21:23.008]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:21:23.568 --> 01:21:25.989]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:21:26.744 --> 01:21:34.070]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:21:37.102 --> 01:21:42.065]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:21:42.526 --> 01:21:46.048]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:21:46.408 --> 01:21:48.890]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:50.131]  Most people have no idea.
[01:21:50.151 --> 01:21:50.891]  They're not after money.
[01:21:50.911 --> 01:21:52.012]  They have all the money they need.
[01:21:52.212 --> 01:21:52.933]  They're after power.
[01:21:53.193 --> 01:21:54.033]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:21:54.334 --> 01:21:58.877]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:21:59.097 --> 01:22:02.599]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:03.019 --> 01:22:03.500]  Endgame.
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:05.641]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:22:05.861 --> 01:22:06.922]  You have been warned.
[01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:14.149]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:14.609 --> 01:22:22.376]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:22.717 --> 01:22:28.302]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[01:22:28.622 --> 01:22:30.583]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:22:30.883 --> 01:22:35.644]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:35.964 --> 01:22:40.706]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:41.186 --> 01:22:45.047]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:45.528 --> 01:22:46.548]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:50.709]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:51.129 --> 01:22:52.530]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:56.011 --> 01:22:58.577]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:22:59.018 --> 01:23:00.681]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.801 --> 01:23:01.022]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:07.512 --> 01:23:10.454]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:23:10.614 --> 01:23:15.837]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:23:16.137 --> 01:23:21.500]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:22.961]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:23:23.321 --> 01:23:32.226]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:23:32.506 --> 01:23:32.626]  Yes.
[01:23:32.646 --> 01:23:34.268]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:23:34.488 --> 01:23:38.653]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:23:38.693 --> 01:23:43.318]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:45.801]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:23:47.543 --> 01:23:48.304]  Keep it natural.
[01:23:48.644 --> 01:23:56.789]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:23:57.030 --> 01:24:01.192]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:24:01.212 --> 01:24:02.253]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:24:16.621 --> 01:24:18.443]  What would the reptilian brain do?
[01:24:19.124 --> 01:24:29.137]  It knows that if it wipes out and kills all its competition, commits genocide, which we see ancient cultures doing to their neighbors over and over again, if you kill everybody, would you come in?
[01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:49.954]  to the promised land, or you're the Aztecs, you're coming to a Mayan area, and you kill everybody, or you're the Nazis, you're gonna go around the world and take over, have an administrative system, have carbon taxes, the Nazis proposed similar taxes, and then have one-child policies, forced inoculations, soft kill.
[01:24:50.915 --> 01:24:54.898]  Then you kill everybody, except your people, then you win.
[01:24:56.311 --> 01:24:57.452]  That's the reptilian brain.
[01:24:57.472 --> 01:25:04.118]  Of course, then that idea continues, and the Nazis would have gone on forever, basically killing each other, just like the priest class were doing in Israel.
[01:25:04.859 --> 01:25:08.942]  Whenever they didn't have some new enemy to fight, they started pressing the tribes under them.
[01:25:09.443 --> 01:25:12.325]  This is just what human beings do over and over again.
[01:25:13.006 --> 01:25:15.068]  And here is Rolling Stone.
[01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:17.570]  And you open this up.
[01:25:17.610 --> 01:25:19.872]  I should have put a bookmark in here.
[01:25:19.892 --> 01:25:21.654]  And it's Ray Kurzweil.
[01:25:23.066 --> 01:25:36.289]  This is exactly what I said in Endgame, from his writings, and the UN's writings, and the Club of Rome's writings, and the World Transhumanist Society, and all the big billionaire tech owners.
[01:25:36.309 --> 01:25:37.910]  They go to big meetings.
[01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:39.950]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:46.592]  When man and machine merge, and it says, meet Ray Kurzweil, prophet of the techno-rapture.
[01:25:46.612 --> 01:25:48.812]  He's made billions of dollars, invented a bunch of computer systems.
[01:25:49.352 --> 01:25:49.972]  By 2045, he releases 2020.
[01:25:54.551 --> 01:25:56.892]  Computers will surpass us in intelligence.
[01:25:56.912 --> 01:26:00.255]  The universe itself will become conscious and humans will live forever.
[01:26:02.036 --> 01:26:07.099]  But when you actually read what Kurzweil says and what all the rest say, they say the elite are going to kill off the majority of us.
[01:26:07.459 --> 01:26:11.121]  They're going to merge with the silicon system that they call rational.
[01:26:11.522 --> 01:26:12.582]  It's the reptilian brain.
[01:26:12.882 --> 01:26:13.283]  Logic.
[01:26:13.323 --> 01:26:16.024]  They say it's logic that I kill all of you and then I win.
[01:26:16.625 --> 01:26:19.506]  They revel in mathematic equations.
[01:26:19.827 --> 01:26:21.648]  But really it's just cold-blooded wickedness.
[01:26:22.895 --> 01:26:24.596]  They would say there is no such thing as wicked.
[01:26:24.676 --> 01:26:25.717]  I am beyond good and evil.
[01:26:25.737 --> 01:26:26.677]  I'm going to kill you.
[01:26:26.957 --> 01:26:29.759]  Now this article doesn't get into all of that.
[01:26:29.799 --> 01:26:30.779]  It gets into some of it.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.821]  Bill Joyce, while the future doesn't need us, does.
[01:26:33.732 --> 01:26:36.413]  But it gets in all the things Kurzweil invented and all the things he did.
[01:26:36.533 --> 01:26:40.155]  Molecular robots will spread through the tiniest recesses of all matter.
[01:26:40.635 --> 01:26:44.757]  Kurzweil predicts turning rocks into trees and living computers.
[01:26:45.037 --> 01:26:46.618]  We won't experience 100 years of progress.
[01:26:46.638 --> 01:26:49.740]  The 21st century will be more like 20,000 years of progress.
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.381]  And he just says, oh, you won't take brain chips?
[01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:53.321]  It won't matter.
[01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:55.202]  The nanotech will instantly take you over.
[01:26:55.782 --> 01:26:58.364]  So they're saying resistance is futile.
[01:26:58.724 --> 01:27:01.045]  You don't have a choice.
[01:27:01.465 --> 01:27:02.966]  We are the final revolution.
[01:27:03.706 --> 01:27:06.668]  And then they put in a liberal, sicky-feely packaging.
[01:27:07.089 --> 01:27:08.850]  What say you to this?
[01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:28.506]  Because when I read the real globalist documents, they say they're going to kill the majority of us because we don't deserve the life extension technology, and that if they can just be made to live to be 140 or so, people that are like 70 now, that then they'll have eternal lives as nanotech beings that will send their consciousness out as spores on the solar wind.
[01:27:28.746 --> 01:27:29.927]  I'm not saying this
[01:27:30.447 --> 01:27:33.314]  They're saying it, and they call us nuts, David Icke.
[01:27:33.635 --> 01:27:35.480]  This is what the world elite believe.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.843]  This is their religion.
[01:27:37.424 --> 01:27:38.026]  What is this?
[01:27:39.335 --> 01:27:47.960]  Well, it's just a tantamount to the insanity that lies behind all that's happening.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.624]  See, cleverness and wisdom are not the same thing, and in fact, cleverness without wisdom is the most destructive force on Earth.
[01:27:55.164 --> 01:28:08.872]  And they are, on a mind level, clever, but they are not wise, and that's why they're so destructive and devastatingly destructive in their potential to wreak havoc in even greater
[01:28:09.552 --> 01:28:10.173]  I don't think so.
[01:28:32.288 --> 01:28:32.649]  I think so.
[01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:51.293]  Thank you.
[01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:16.740]  You see, because the body is a biological computer, you can access it through technological means.
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:25.073]  This is what this whole thing about the computer brain interface is, where they're talking about putting a chip in the brain and then you can work your computer without using your hands.
[01:29:26.074 --> 01:29:28.976]  That's all because they're actually connecting two computers.
[01:29:29.076 --> 01:29:30.397]  One more fantastic than the other.
[01:29:30.417 --> 01:29:31.418]  Yes, but two computers.
[01:29:31.938 --> 01:29:35.781]  And so this nanotechnology takes on a completely new light when you realize that.
[01:29:36.101 --> 01:29:39.324]  Because its ability to influence the body computer is fantastic.
[01:29:39.464 --> 01:29:41.946]  And that's the real level that they're operating on.
[01:29:42.186 --> 01:29:43.007]  The nano level.
[01:29:43.027 --> 01:29:44.768]  Alright, long segment coming up.
[01:29:44.808 --> 01:29:45.609]  Take phone calls.
[01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:47.210]  30 minutes left with David Icke.
[01:29:47.230 --> 01:29:48.031]  DavidIcke.com.
[01:29:48.111 --> 01:29:51.753]  And David, tell me about your speaking engagements when we get back.
[01:29:51.834 --> 01:29:52.874]  Okay folks, stay with us.
[01:29:52.894 --> 01:29:53.455]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:58.593 --> 01:30:01.575]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.516 --> 01:30:05.198]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:08.183 --> 01:30:09.743]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:09.883 --> 01:30:12.784]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[01:30:12.844 --> 01:30:14.524]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[01:30:14.624 --> 01:30:17.365]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:30:17.585 --> 01:30:20.426]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line where you have your own bread.
[01:30:20.626 --> 01:30:24.286]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[01:30:24.426 --> 01:30:29.667]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:30:29.948 --> 01:30:36.829]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:32:40.322 --> 01:32:40.802]  I think so.
[01:33:24.171 --> 01:33:31.816]  We're going to do 5-10 minutes of overdrive today, because I want to just sit back and let David Icke make his statement about where he sees the world's going.
[01:33:32.277 --> 01:33:35.779]  I have a bunch of other stuff I want to get to, but I want to take your calls and time is running out.
[01:33:35.799 --> 01:33:38.281]  And I got some sponsors I need to thank right now.
[01:33:38.641 --> 01:33:40.843]  So we'll go back to David Icke here in just one moment.
[01:33:41.303 --> 01:33:44.585]  First off, acolablue.com.
[01:33:44.886 --> 01:33:49.249]  Ladies and gentlemen, your body is a biological computer, an electrochemical computer.
[01:33:50.532 --> 01:33:57.799]  And the establishment, on record, is forcibly medicating us with Prozac, statins, on record, in the water supply.
[01:33:59.481 --> 01:34:01.063]  And sodium fluoride and the rest of it.
[01:34:02.332 --> 01:34:10.640]  McCullough Blue is a high-quality atmospheric water generator that grabs the water out of the air and puts it through reverse osmosis, carbon, UV filters, you name it.
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:11.501]  Seven different filters.

[01:35:13.613 --> 01:35:16.914]  And again, if you forget the address, Max the Little Orange Gorilla.
[01:35:16.974 --> 01:35:19.555]  And last sponsor of the day, my solar backup.
[01:35:19.575 --> 01:35:21.195]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:35:21.235 --> 01:35:22.496]  Hurricanes, snow and ice storms.
[01:35:23.016 --> 01:35:25.677]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[01:35:26.057 --> 01:35:29.538]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:33.839]  It's designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[01:35:34.239 --> 01:35:42.122]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of a power source, 1,800 power plant, a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity,
[01:35:43.157 --> 01:35:48.461]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:35:49.702 --> 01:35:52.604]  The solar generators, like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[01:35:52.944 --> 01:35:55.206]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[01:35:55.606 --> 01:35:58.428]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move now.
[01:35:59.329 --> 01:36:03.912]  MySolarBackup.com, that's MySolarBackup.com, or you can always call them toll-free at 877-327-0365.
[01:36:03.932 --> 01:36:03.992]  877-327-0365.
[01:36:04.033 --> 01:36:04.413]  David Ike!
[01:36:11.246 --> 01:36:23.978]  Briefly getting back into this Ray Kurzweil stuff, I know you've read what the futurists, the transhumanists, and the eugenicists say, and you're right, they just say, well we're scientific, and we say that you have no right to the future and we're going to get rid of you.
[01:36:24.839 --> 01:36:29.343]  But then if you talk about going after them physically, they freak out and yell and scream and call SWAT teams on you.
[01:36:29.904 --> 01:36:35.909]  So really it's just a cold-blooded, as we say, and again, reptiles are cold-blooded, the reptilian brain,
[01:36:37.321 --> 01:36:44.863]  This is a cold-blooded idea and system and they sit there like our opinions don't even matter, but that's a mind game.
[01:36:45.503 --> 01:36:46.964]  We do have force of will.
[01:36:47.044 --> 01:36:53.806]  We can stand up to them and they're scared of us having that purpose and deciding we're not listening to their propaganda.
[01:36:54.046 --> 01:36:54.986]  We are warm-blooded.
[01:36:55.566 --> 01:37:12.157]  We do have red blood, and we're marching against their tyranny, whatever the cost, because humanity's future depends on it not being captured by a group of predatory homo sapiens sapiens who are acting like vampires.
[01:37:13.462 --> 01:37:23.793]  Yeah, the thing is, Alex, that what they're terrified of more than anything else is people becoming conscious beyond mind and beyond the computer level of perception.
[01:37:24.234 --> 01:37:30.681]  You can see in their own writings how they use phrases like, you know, in my words, they
[01:37:31.201 --> 01:37:32.582]  They're terrified of mavericks.
[01:37:32.682 --> 01:37:35.284]  Mavericks are people that could bring the whole thing down.
[01:37:35.804 --> 01:37:36.665]  And what are mavericks?
[01:37:36.765 --> 01:37:49.113]  Mavericks are people who are not programmed, who are not following secular ritual behavior and responses and reactions, but are actually conscious enough to act in ways that are different to the norm, ways that you can't call.
[01:37:49.653 --> 01:37:56.278]  And you know, it's so important that if you take the body to be in the center of this,
[01:37:56.898 --> 01:38:13.685]  On one side you've got the Illuminati families and I would say what is behind them trying to program the computer and trying to destabilize the computer because all this stuff with fluoride and aspartame and all these other electrochemical sources of disruption
[01:38:14.205 --> 01:38:17.529]  They're there to literally put viruses in the computer.
[01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:20.873]  And when you put viruses in your laptop computer, what happens?
[01:38:20.933 --> 01:38:22.495]  It stops working properly.
[01:38:22.535 --> 01:38:23.736]  It stops thinking straight.
[01:38:23.796 --> 01:38:25.859]  It stops operating to full potential.
[01:38:25.879 --> 01:38:26.640]  That's the idea.
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.103]  But when consciousness enters the body,
[01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:35.474]  It can overpower those programs and it can overpower those effects on the body.
[01:38:35.934 --> 01:38:46.623]  I remember a story, it illustrates what I'm talking about, when there was one of these Eastern Mystic guys who was being used as part of an LSD experiment.
[01:38:46.763 --> 01:38:54.109]  They experimented in the 60s with LSD and some professor was over trying to see the effects on people.
[01:38:54.649 --> 01:38:58.753]  And he gave this guy a dose of LSD, which should have blown his mind.
[01:38:59.393 --> 01:39:00.014]  Nothing happened.
[01:39:00.034 --> 01:39:01.014]  The guy smiled at him.
[01:39:01.474 --> 01:39:10.599]  He then doubled the dose eventually, and the guy still smiled at him, and there was no effects of the LSD on this guy whatsoever.
[01:39:10.699 --> 01:39:10.919]  Why?
[01:39:10.939 --> 01:39:15.642]  Because the guy was conscious, and through consciousness it overpowered the effect of the drug.
[01:39:16.222 --> 01:39:17.923]  And that's just an illustration of how
[01:39:18.934 --> 01:39:29.561]  When we're conscious, we can overpower all these attacks on the body, and we can see, from a consciousness point of view, blatant means of manipulation.
[01:39:30.161 --> 01:39:32.763]  And that's what these guys are terrified of.
[01:39:32.863 --> 01:39:38.987]  And I mean terrified, because when humanity becomes conscious, their game is over.
[01:39:39.047 --> 01:39:40.328]  It's like we talked about last time.
[01:39:41.431 --> 01:39:54.215]  The movie with the grasshoppers, where he said about the ants, if they work out that there's loads of them and a few of us, there goes our way of life.
[01:39:54.515 --> 01:39:56.916]  When we become conscious, there goes our way of life.
[01:39:56.956 --> 01:40:07.760]  And that's why they work so constantly and incessantly through electrochemical means, through programming, through words and other means, through religious belief.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.763]  And David, I mean just to simplify it, by poisoning the higher brain, the higher levels, which is a physiological fact,
[01:40:30.186 --> 01:40:39.559]  As people get poisoned and toxified more and more, they revert to the lower animal, reptile, saltwater crocodile brain.
[01:40:40.239 --> 01:40:45.286]  And just like a person once they've had Alzheimer's, now people at 25 getting it from all the aluminum and mercury.
[01:40:46.287 --> 01:40:51.693]  Everything reverts back to the level of a baby and the old man's throwing his feces against the wall.
[01:40:51.973 --> 01:40:56.298]  I mean, that's a horrible parallel, but they want to keep us in that.
[01:40:56.798 --> 01:41:01.523]  And now you talk to the public, you watch sitcoms, and they talk slow.
[01:41:03.125 --> 01:41:05.488]  You see the public, you'll see somebody who's upright.
[01:41:06.028 --> 01:41:06.609]  Yeah.
[01:41:20.565 --> 01:41:23.368]  And it seems like it's accelerating right now, David.
[01:41:23.588 --> 01:41:31.814]  It was kind of freaking me out, because I wasn't on ACID, but it was almost like an ACID trip watching, and I was seeing other people that were noticing.
[01:41:33.175 --> 01:41:34.216]  Do you see the point I'm making?
[01:41:34.336 --> 01:41:36.838]  Well, the thing is, there's a parting of the ways here.
[01:41:36.938 --> 01:41:38.359]  I mean, I'm seeing it more and more.
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:47.647]  There are those that are becoming more and more programmed as the programming increases, and there's those that are becoming less and less programmed as their consciousness increases.
[01:41:48.047 --> 01:41:49.828]  It's very much a parting of the ways.
[01:41:49.888 --> 01:42:03.613]  There's two very different types of human being emerging which is becoming clearer and clearer by the week as the people become conscious and people, others, get caught more and more in the programming and become less and less.
[01:42:04.233 --> 01:42:05.635]  We're good to go.
[01:42:25.457 --> 01:42:45.322]  And you can get into it through words and basically it's a war on the human body computer receiver transmission system and it's much like a stage hypnotist who is planting beliefs into the stooges on the stage and a belief is like a computer program, it's like a piece of software because it
[01:42:47.105 --> 01:42:48.066]  It's a perception.
[01:42:48.146 --> 01:42:59.673]  We believe that the Federal Reserve isn't private, even though it is, so people think it's the government, and people will kill each other for a thousand dollars, and they're just making it zeroes and ones on a computer.
[01:42:59.733 --> 01:43:00.494]  It's an illusion.
[01:43:00.534 --> 01:43:01.254]  It's a spell.
[01:43:01.634 --> 01:43:02.615]  Yeah, it's a spell, yeah.
[01:43:02.655 --> 01:43:11.401]  I mean, one of the errors of my talks is breaking the spell, and the key point I want to make here is it's not so much the reality
[01:43:12.328 --> 01:43:14.509]  It's how we perceive reality.
[01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:17.391]  That's the interface that they want to manipulate.
[01:43:17.951 --> 01:43:33.520]  I mean, we live in an infinite reality, but what they want to do is so program the receiver transmitter that reads reality in this five sense world, so that it reads reality to fit their agenda.
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:37.362]  It's not reality, it's the way we read it they want to manipulate.
[01:43:37.942 --> 01:43:45.288]  And basically, you know, you can have a hypnotist on a stage and he'll get someone to eat an apple, eat a potato, but taste an apple.
[01:43:45.689 --> 01:43:53.335]  And all he's doing is putting a belief, a program, a software into the brain so that when the electrical signal from the tongue...
[01:43:53.988 --> 01:43:55.289]  We're good to go.
[01:44:12.438 --> 01:44:28.941]  And that's what the New World Order is, is a mass hypnotist, as you're saying, and more and more I realize the cops, the government people, the New World Order people, you talk to a lot of them, and they are some of the blindest folks out there, and they're obsessive compulsive, they're obsessed with...
[01:44:29.982 --> 01:44:48.215]  Like you said, hierarchical systems, and they are completely reduced down to almost nothing, only getting that tiny bit of, not even small spectrum of reality, false reality fed into them, and then they arrange themselves in guilds.
[01:44:48.695 --> 01:44:58.863]  They're the delusional crazy people, because to me, crazy is denying what the full spectrum of reality is, telling us we're crazy, and they arrange themselves together above us.
[01:44:59.773 --> 01:45:19.256]  That is a very, very important point, because what happens is that these training programs for people in uniform, for government administrators, and all the people that administer or law-enforce the system, these training programs are designed to program these people
[01:45:19.796 --> 01:45:27.281]  It's the local, non-governmental, and the government gives them all the power, and it really is the government to run every county, every city.
[01:45:27.301 --> 01:45:27.401]  Yeah.
[01:45:46.175 --> 01:46:02.541]  Yeah, what they're doing, what Common Purpose are doing, and Common Purpose means common reality, Common Purpose are going around and local government, police, health services, all these institutions of the state,
[01:46:03.041 --> 01:46:03.522]  I don't
[01:46:19.541 --> 01:46:20.822]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:46:40.558 --> 01:46:42.180]  Well, let me expand on that.
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:04.161]  Let me explain.
[01:47:04.221 --> 01:47:05.261]  And we're going to go to calls.
[01:47:05.822 --> 01:47:21.711]  They have made it now where the police follow ridiculous orders and enforce it on the people to set the precedent where then the craziness of cops, because an ambulance doesn't run... I mean, there's video of a cop car at 100 miles an hour flies up behind an ambulance.
[01:47:21.731 --> 01:47:23.672]  The ambulance doesn't even know it's there.
[01:47:23.752 --> 01:47:27.995]  It goes around the ambulance, then pulls the ambulance over and beats the guy up.
[01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:32.618]  And the cops then go to charge the guy they beat up on video who didn't touch him.
[01:47:33.118 --> 01:47:37.484]  And then the cops think that's normal now, that when they beat you up, they charge you.
[01:47:37.804 --> 01:47:38.645]  It's a cult!
[01:47:39.306 --> 01:47:44.633]  Like O'Brien's torturing Winston in 1984, and he says we're the priest of power.
[01:47:45.574 --> 01:47:48.639]  It's just raw reptilian exercise.
[01:47:49.179 --> 01:47:54.103]  And then now the CPS is grabbing everybody's kids for no reason and saying you can't raise your voice.
[01:47:54.624 --> 01:48:07.795]  They are the cult and they're giving new download programs every week now to their minions in the sensitivity training to get crazier and crazier ramping up towards some horrible future.
[01:48:08.055 --> 01:48:11.899]  Some horrid mass culling telling us torturing people's good.
[01:48:13.466 --> 01:48:38.985]  The point is here that we can talk about robots being made in the future and all the rest of it, but you take consciousness out of the human body and all you're left with is a biological computer, in effect a robot, and what they're doing is taking consciousness out through their manipulation techniques and leaving what is left, which is just a computer system, and what can
[01:48:38.985 --> 01:48:39.245]  And he is.
[01:49:03.274 --> 01:49:06.035]  And the establishment tests its biological androids.
[01:49:06.055 --> 01:49:09.975]  They're testing the police to say, okay, beat up ambulance drivers for no reason.
[01:49:10.395 --> 01:49:13.396]  Okay, taser somebody because they don't sign the ticket.
[01:49:13.936 --> 01:49:16.017]  And then next they'll do something even more outrageous.
[01:49:16.117 --> 01:49:32.920]  Can someone fully lose consciousness, you know, from the Christian perspective that I see it, that lose the soul, the ultimate sin, harden the heart, go so far that they become pure biological android vessels of the Hive program system?
[01:49:33.729 --> 01:49:41.533]  Well yes, because everything's one consciousness and you can't lose a connection to a higher consciousness.
[01:49:41.973 --> 01:49:44.114]  What you can lose is an awareness of it.
[01:49:44.574 --> 01:50:03.043]  And then without that awareness, you act in the sense of the awareness that you're left with, which is a limited awareness that has a completely different perception of reality to what it would have if it was in its full level of awareness, which is what I call consciousness.
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:04.321]  And so they're damned.
[01:50:04.441 --> 01:50:11.565]  I mean, that'd be like if there was a dome city, hypothetically, two miles under my feet.
[01:50:11.725 --> 01:50:14.007]  I don't know it's there, therefore it doesn't exist.
[01:50:14.387 --> 01:50:20.551]  Yeah, the thing is that in an ideal world, you've got consciousness, having experience through the physical body.
[01:50:20.611 --> 01:50:25.934]  So you're in this world and you're of it, or not of it.
[01:50:26.074 --> 01:50:30.417]  And the computer system and the mind, the interface, is fine.
[01:50:31.778 --> 01:50:38.804]  It's the means through which, like this computer in front of me, allows me to experience the collective reality we call the Internet.
[01:50:39.305 --> 01:50:45.150]  The key is when consciousness is kept out and what's left is the computer.
[01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:52.777]  Because then the computer is deciding where you go on the Internet and what you think of it and how you act on it, not the person on the keyboard.
[01:50:53.818 --> 01:50:54.899]  And that's what these people are.
[01:50:56.713 --> 01:50:57.233]  Incredible.
[01:50:57.273 --> 01:50:59.755]  David's agreed to go 5-10 minutes into overdrive.
[01:50:59.775 --> 01:51:04.117]  We're going to come back in the final segment, and then in the overdrive we'll take the rest of the calls as well.
[01:51:04.157 --> 01:51:07.859]  Just mind-blowing, because as I research this, I'm finding out he's right.
[01:51:08.319 --> 01:51:14.302]  We are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[01:51:14.562 --> 01:51:15.403]  Take a deep breath.
[01:51:16.343 --> 01:51:22.626]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[01:51:22.867 --> 01:51:23.907]  Have a glass of water.
[01:51:24.407 --> 01:51:25.568]  Can you taste the harmful
[01:51:25.708 --> 01:51:29.729]  Chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other chemicals?
[01:51:30.049 --> 01:51:30.849]  Of course you can't.
[01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:35.950]  The air that you breathe and the water you drink should help maintain good health, not take away from it.
[01:51:36.250 --> 01:51:44.492]  AirAndAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these toxins.
[01:51:44.812 --> 01:51:52.153]  AirAndAqua.com carries whole house air and water purification systems, air conditioners, showerhead filters, water testing kits,
[01:51:52.193 --> 01:51:52.253]  Yes!
[01:52:08.852 --> 01:52:14.158]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:14.879 --> 01:52:20.225]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:20.766 --> 01:52:26.933]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:27.253 --> 01:52:29.094]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:29.214 --> 01:52:31.616]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:31.676 --> 01:52:42.623]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:44.884 --> 01:52:46.165]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:46.545 --> 01:52:47.946]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:48.406 --> 01:52:54.630]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:55.299 --> 01:53:03.082]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:03.563 --> 01:53:04.703]  The Obama Deception.
[01:53:05.143 --> 01:53:06.344]  The people strike back!
[01:53:08.439 --> 01:53:10.221]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[01:53:10.502 --> 01:53:13.205]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[01:53:13.445 --> 01:53:15.388]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[01:53:15.688 --> 01:53:16.449]  Here's the story.
[01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:21.255]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[01:53:21.455 --> 01:53:22.477]  Now here's the bad news.
[01:53:22.717 --> 01:53:25.901]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands.
[01:53:26.141 --> 01:53:26.682]  We're good to go.
[01:53:51.224 --> 01:53:56.109]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[01:53:56.390 --> 01:54:00.314]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[01:54:00.514 --> 01:54:03.297]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[01:54:19.298 --> 01:54:27.223]  What an amazing interview with David Icke, and we're going to take some of your phone calls right now from Chris Kim, Aria, Ryan, Tim Leo.
[01:54:27.263 --> 01:54:34.288]  In fact, Aria, Ryan, Tim Leo, and others have been given the number 888-201-2244 to take a few calls in overdrive with David Icke.
[01:54:34.648 --> 01:54:45.956]  But David's going to be speaking in Phoenix October 17th at DavidIcke.com, Phoenix, Arizona, and then Bellingham in between Seattle and Vancouver.
[01:54:47.742 --> 01:54:50.102]  And what date is that in Bellingham, David Icke?
[01:54:50.703 --> 01:54:51.843]  The 4th.
[01:54:51.903 --> 01:54:52.343]  October 4th.
[01:54:52.363 --> 01:54:53.623]  Speaking all day on the Sunday, yeah.
[01:54:54.463 --> 01:54:57.744]  And folks better get tickets, because, I mean, don't you sell out every event you have?
[01:54:58.624 --> 01:55:03.465]  Well, that's been the case for a little while, yeah, because the interest is so fantastic.
[01:55:03.525 --> 01:55:11.426]  I mean, you know, after Phoenix and Bellingham, I'm going to, well, I'm doing Amsterdam just before them, and then I'm going to Gothenburg in Sweden, Athens, Greece, Zurich, Switzerland.
[01:55:11.786 --> 01:55:13.367]  I mean, the world is waking up, Alex.
[01:55:13.587 --> 01:55:14.387]  Hallelujah to that.
[01:55:14.926 --> 01:55:19.150]  Yeah, and I don't think the globalists can set off nukes and stage new wars and get away with it.
[01:55:19.230 --> 01:55:25.375]  I mean, I'll tell you, this is the great crossroads that we're certainly at right now.
[01:55:25.455 --> 01:55:28.157]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead, welcome.
[01:55:29.258 --> 01:55:30.319]  Hey Alex, hey David.
[01:55:30.979 --> 01:55:37.445]  Chris had a question about what we see a lot lately, the elite are real obsessed and into the occult.
[01:55:38.286 --> 01:55:43.950]  And they've kind of been commercializing it, like with movies and with celebrities wearing Kabbalah bracelets.
[01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:44.950]  You saw that for a while.
[01:55:44.970 --> 01:55:45.691]  It was a trend.
[01:55:47.292 --> 01:55:54.056]  There are big rituals, like aspects to 9-11 and Columbine and these types of things.
[01:55:54.136 --> 01:56:01.940]  Yes, they mainline it, and then it's revelation of the method, because again, they're engaging in mass programming of the archetypal reptilian brain.
[01:56:03.081 --> 01:56:15.525]  That's exactly what they're doing, yeah, and other things too, because, again, it's important to stress that these people understand reality to a far greater extent than they allow the people to.
[01:56:15.545 --> 01:56:25.768]  You know, this is why they've destroyed ancient knowledge and destroyed ancient history and stuff like that, as much as they can, so they can replace it with their fake history.
[01:56:26.208 --> 01:56:31.310]  So we don't know, you know, where all this has come from, and it's very much more difficult to get a fix on where we are.
[01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:42.055]  And they understand reality and their rituals are designed to manipulate and program reality.
[01:56:42.095 --> 01:56:42.956]  That's why they do them.
[01:56:42.976 --> 01:56:51.760]  And people think of satanic rituals, you know, with people around a slab at an altar and my goodness do they go on and some of the most famous people in the world take part in them.
[01:56:52.281 --> 01:56:54.462]  But there are mass rituals too.
[01:56:55.443 --> 01:56:55.824]  We're good to go.
[01:57:04.666 --> 01:57:09.448]  This reality, and even mainstream science is understanding this now, is digital.
[01:57:09.928 --> 01:57:14.370]  Another reason why I think it's highly significant to move over to digital television, personally.
[01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:30.436]  And it's numbers, it's mathematics, and so all this numerology and all these occult ritual codes that they use, where they do things on a certain day, and you see 33s and 9-11s, these are all coming from a level of knowledge of how you can manipulate numbers.
[01:57:30.536 --> 01:57:31.537]  And let me throw this out.
[01:57:32.037 --> 01:57:36.878]  We got a break here and start the next hour, so let's get Tim to call in on the new line there, Tim in Ohio.
[01:57:36.898 --> 01:57:37.738]  But let me throw this out.
[01:57:37.998 --> 01:57:38.918]  The Aztecs did it.
[01:57:38.998 --> 01:57:42.699]  Why do separate human cultures that don't even know each other do the same things?
[01:57:42.719 --> 01:57:43.959]  This is a system of control.
[01:57:44.179 --> 01:57:57.562]  The Romans wrote that they used the gladiatorial events where you would go like it was entertainment and watch your neighbor have his guts torn out, so a month later when you were getting your guts torn out, your neighbor wouldn't stand up for you against the state.
[01:57:57.822 --> 01:58:00.002]  It's making a sport like these cop shows
[01:58:00.402 --> 01:58:07.105]  Out of seeing the cops hunt us down, we're dehumanizing ourselves, so the ritual has a reason.
[01:58:07.125 --> 01:58:08.365]  There's a method to the madness.
[01:58:08.405 --> 01:58:09.406]  Is that what you're saying, David?
[01:58:09.606 --> 01:58:10.506]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:58:10.546 --> 01:58:16.509]  I mean, they are crazy, but they're very clever in the way that they use the knowledge they have.
[01:58:17.045 --> 01:58:20.207]  Crazy Like a Fox, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:58:32.955 --> 01:58:35.376]  He's coming to the United States to speak in October.
[01:58:35.396 --> 01:58:42.020]  We're going to break for one minute, say bye-bye to stations, come back in overdrive at PrisonPlanet.tv and the InfoWars.com streams.
[01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:44.582]  Great job to the crews, great job to everybody else.
[01:58:45.162 --> 01:58:46.762]  8-10 minutes overdrive right now.
[01:58:46.822 --> 01:58:47.243]  Here we go.
[01:58:50.364 --> 01:58:51.904]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:58.046 --> 01:59:06.708]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:59:07.149 --> 01:59:11.850]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:14.871]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[01:59:15.291 --> 01:59:16.912]  Actually results in disease.
[01:59:17.352 --> 01:59:26.137]  Go to AmericanSuperfoods.com today and see the wide range of foods available that were designed to help your mind and body work the way they were intended to.

[01:59:43.146 --> 01:59:44.667]  Folks, you gotta check these out.

[01:59:54.294 --> 01:59:56.595]  Again, the website is AmericanSuperfoods.com.
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:29.024]  All right, we don't have a lot of time left with David Icke, so I want to go to your phone calls.
[02:00:29.044 --> 02:00:31.045]  That's the whole point of us going into overdrive.
[02:00:31.065 --> 02:00:33.766]  Next time I have him, I've got to just share him with the caller.
[02:00:33.806 --> 02:00:37.728]  He's talking about so much and the nature of reality.
[02:00:39.089 --> 02:00:41.870]  Who's up first here, guys, on the phone system?
[02:00:45.436 --> 02:00:46.797]  I'm sorry, I can't hear that, Comer.
[02:00:48.297 --> 02:00:49.258]  Can't hear you guys either.
[02:00:52.299 --> 02:00:53.480]  Austin, can you hear me?
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:54.700]  Yes, I can, Gary.
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:55.640]  You're on the air with David Icke.
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:56.081]  Go ahead.
[02:00:56.361 --> 02:00:57.661]  Yeah, thank you both, Alex.
[02:00:57.681 --> 02:00:58.902]  You're doing an amazing job.
[02:00:58.942 --> 02:01:00.302]  I really appreciate what you're doing.
[02:01:00.362 --> 02:01:02.403]  David, it's great to hear you on the show.
[02:01:02.924 --> 02:01:04.624]  Really quick thing about chemtrails.
[02:01:05.004 --> 02:01:09.746]  We're seeing tons of them across America right now, and I went and did my research.
[02:01:10.247 --> 02:01:10.927]  Two questions.
[02:01:11.685 --> 02:01:14.728]  One, how can we make it more public?
[02:01:15.108 --> 02:01:18.110]  Because the media has ignored all my requests to take a look at it.
[02:01:18.791 --> 02:01:28.959]  And two, when I researched it, and I dug into the patent, the Hughes patent, they were going to use thorium oxide and aluminum oxide, and right now they're actually using barium oxide.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:35.485]  Now if they really wanted to wipe us out quickly, thorium oxide will cause men to go sterile.
[02:01:35.985 --> 02:01:37.427]  But they chose barium oxide.
[02:01:37.527 --> 02:01:38.207]  Let me stop you.
[02:01:38.247 --> 02:01:39.168]  You say they chose.
[02:01:39.188 --> 02:01:41.671]  That's only one program and I've looked at that as well.
[02:01:41.691 --> 02:01:44.273]  There's thousands of different programs going on.
[02:01:44.313 --> 02:01:48.737]  They're spraying a whole bunch of different types of metals and oxides in the atmosphere.
[02:01:48.778 --> 02:01:51.961]  David Icke, the chemtrails, an attempt to poison us.
[02:01:52.699 --> 02:02:11.176]  Well, I was earlier this year in Arizona and I was sitting in a house every morning watching the sky, I think it was coming up from an Arizona airbase, the sky being crisscrossed every day until the blue sky disappeared and it was just
[02:02:13.016 --> 02:02:15.497]  All the chemtrails joined together to make a cloudy day.
[02:02:15.517 --> 02:02:16.317]  It was extraordinary.
[02:02:16.337 --> 02:02:18.138]  It happened day after day after day after day.
[02:02:18.578 --> 02:02:29.781]  I'll tell you what my information is, and that's that among all the other stuff that is identifiable in these chemtrails, what is also in there is nanotechnology.
[02:02:30.441 --> 02:02:31.022]  It's interesting.
[02:02:31.042 --> 02:02:35.523]  We mentioned earlier in the show, Alex, and I think this is one way they're putting
[02:02:36.603 --> 02:02:36.903]  I think?
[02:02:54.202 --> 02:02:57.044]  is create a sub-reality around the Earth.
[02:02:57.064 --> 02:02:58.605]  It's a simple thing.
[02:02:58.665 --> 02:02:59.846]  How do you affect all the fish?
[02:03:00.387 --> 02:03:01.167]  You affect the sea.
[02:03:01.928 --> 02:03:10.955]  And the radio waves bouncing off the ionosphere from HAARP, and the way they're changing the lower atmosphere, I think, are fundamentally connected.
[02:03:10.995 --> 02:03:15.118]  I've not connected everything there, but I'm sure that that's where the truth lies.
[02:03:15.658 --> 02:03:23.104]  And it's to do with creating a sub-reality in which they can feed in these thought forms, and thought
[02:03:23.944 --> 02:03:32.572]  Uh, messages through the radio waves on the frequency of the human body computer receiver transmission frequencies.
[02:03:32.873 --> 02:03:35.175]  So they're feeding realities into us that way as well.
[02:03:36.325 --> 02:03:46.808]  Well, we know that, I mean, I remember you talking about this over a decade ago, seeing government documents and patents, but I saw the Baltimore Sun like seven years ago saying, oh, DARPA's going to put in U.S.
[02:03:46.848 --> 02:03:53.651]  cities towers with different wavelengths they found to calm people if there's ever an emergency.
[02:03:54.051 --> 02:03:56.492]  I mean, they are admitting they're doing this.
[02:03:56.532 --> 02:03:57.652]  This is not our opinion.
[02:03:58.123 --> 02:04:11.399]  Yeah, and you know in They Live where at the end of the movie they find that there's a transmission from the top of the TV tower which is making it impossible for the public to see the real controllers.
[02:04:11.439 --> 02:04:14.803]  I think that that is also massively based on truth.
[02:04:16.004 --> 02:04:28.011]  Because the body computer has a receiver transmitter frequency, if they can find technology, and of course they have, which can broadcast on that frequency, they're actually feeding information into the human mind.
[02:04:28.251 --> 02:04:29.472]  And of course, what do people think?
[02:04:29.792 --> 02:04:31.193]  They think it's their thoughts.
[02:04:31.593 --> 02:04:42.059]  And also, it can shut the human mind down, so it's not seeing certain frequencies on which certain things are happening, so that they're going on and we can't even see them, just as they live kind of symbolized.
[02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:44.583]  Well, David, I want to make a few final calls and let you go.
[02:04:44.603 --> 02:04:48.069]  We've taken enough of your time, but why did you wake up?
[02:04:48.190 --> 02:04:49.352]  Why did I wake up?
[02:04:49.993 --> 02:04:53.219]  Why do some people wake up and other people don't?
[02:04:54.468 --> 02:04:58.170]  Well, I think that it's literally the depth of programming.
[02:04:58.691 --> 02:05:06.375]  You know, if you are surrounded by six foot of concrete, it's much more difficult to perceive what's outside.
[02:05:06.395 --> 02:05:10.018]  You know, if you've got an inch of concrete, then you might hear something.
[02:05:10.618 --> 02:05:15.181]  And what's happening is that people are waking up.
[02:05:16.762 --> 02:05:19.443]  And in accordance to how asleep they were.
[02:05:20.044 --> 02:05:26.888]  And what's happening now is people are waking up who further back down the line were very asleep and that's very, very encouraging.
[02:05:27.308 --> 02:05:28.248]  What about genetics?
[02:05:28.308 --> 02:05:36.993]  You're always saying that the elites are obsessed with genetics and we know they are because they want to focus the genetics for the type of predatory system they're into.
[02:05:37.013 --> 02:05:39.475]  Is it also genetics to be awake to this?
[02:05:40.349 --> 02:05:43.873]  Well, consciousness can overpower the computer.
[02:05:43.893 --> 02:05:45.994]  What will overpower the reality of the computer?
[02:05:46.014 --> 02:05:51.439]  What they're trying to do is put people so powerfully into computer reality through genetic manipulation.
[02:05:51.459 --> 02:05:55.583]  And, of course, genetically modified food is only there for one reason.
[02:05:55.643 --> 02:05:56.824]  It's to genetically modify us.
[02:05:56.844 --> 02:05:59.247]  Well, they admit it kills the animals they feed it to.
[02:06:00.547 --> 02:06:06.551]  So that the body computer becomes a less and less effective receiver transmitter of higher levels of information.
[02:06:07.011 --> 02:06:15.295]  I don't know how long we've got left, but let me say this... You've got as much time as you want, but I don't want to keep you past... I just want to say this one thing, because you brought up this thing about genetics.
[02:06:15.315 --> 02:06:16.296]  This is what I feel.
[02:06:17.037 --> 02:06:24.262]  You know, I've talked about this reptilian stuff, and people kind of immediately kind of dismiss it because it's so different to their reality.
[02:06:24.763 --> 02:06:33.509]  You look at some of the things in the Bible, you look at endless accounts in other ancient writings, and you'll see this theme coming up.
[02:06:33.889 --> 02:06:36.051]  For me, I mean, do people think that the
[02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:38.271]  I don't know.
[02:06:56.451 --> 02:06:56.971]  Exactly!
[02:06:57.231 --> 02:07:03.772]  The Jewish name for that snake actually refers to a humanoid being.
[02:07:04.252 --> 02:07:25.896]  Now for me, that whole Adam and Eve kind of symbolism which you find around the world where it talks about these reptilian gods manipulating human genetics, for me what they've done, and there's increasing hard genetic evidence for this, is they spliced the genes around, or the DNA around, so that we stopped perceiving
[02:07:25.896 --> 02:07:26.797]  We're good to go.
[02:07:46.631 --> 02:08:00.984]  I would say very strongly, my research is moving so fast in this direction that the human form has been genetically manipulated, and we used to have far more strands of DNA than we do now, and this all relates to this junk DNA that they say they don't know what it does.
[02:08:01.004 --> 02:08:02.005]  Well, I'll tell you what it does.
[02:08:02.345 --> 02:08:07.870]  It connects us to all those frequency areas we could decode at one point that we can't decode now.
[02:08:08.151 --> 02:08:11.594]  What we call dark energy, dark mass, is just a continuation
[02:08:12.535 --> 02:08:15.616]  Well, by the way, David, this is not just your opinion.
[02:08:15.696 --> 02:08:17.477]  As you know, major scientific institutions, governments
[02:08:30.342 --> 02:08:54.785]  Had always said it was junk DNA, but now they're noticing that even if you believe in evolution, on a different evolutionary curve, humans have in their DNA copies of all these other life forms that aren't in our supposed evolutionary development with the way that, you know, they've put out evolution and all the disinformation packaged on that, and top scientists who were atheists
[02:08:55.405 --> 02:09:00.767]  Are now saying, I don't know what made it, but this stuff is engineered.
[02:09:01.228 --> 02:09:02.348]  Yeah, well, exactly.
[02:09:02.648 --> 02:09:10.011]  And you know, the human condition can be brilliantly symbolized by what's happening in China.
[02:09:10.812 --> 02:09:20.516]  We have a collective reality called the Internet, which is very, very, in a much lesser way, of course, very symbolic of the reality we're actually experiencing, the matrix.
[02:09:21.292 --> 02:09:37.426]  What they do in China, the authorities, because they don't want the people to have access to information that could wake them up and get them to see the situation, is they're firewalling off computers, of course, so that people in China can only access a much smaller part of the internet than the rest of the population of the world can.
[02:09:37.446 --> 02:09:37.926]  But that didn't work!
[02:09:38.027 --> 02:09:43.451]  Hold on, that didn't work, so now they're going to, by law, make all new computers have a self-regulator built into it.
[02:09:43.751 --> 02:09:48.896]  That's the drugs, that's the chemicals, that's the programming in the computer itself, not just the network.
[02:09:49.156 --> 02:10:07.171]  Yeah, and what initially happened, I would suggest, is that those body computers were programmed to not receive and therefore decode and experience the range of frequencies we could before, which scientists are calling dark mass, dark energy in this universe.
[02:10:07.971 --> 02:10:09.913]  And so we're actually, and look at it,
[02:10:10.453 --> 02:10:16.995]  Visible light, the only frequency range that we can perceive, is ludicrously tiny.
[02:10:17.835 --> 02:10:18.195]  Why?
[02:10:18.495 --> 02:10:23.316]  Because the body computer has been made to only access that frequency.
[02:10:24.177 --> 02:10:36.580]  And that's what's happened, and that's why we can't see the gods now that operate just outside of visible light, as the ancient accounts talked about in eons ago.
[02:10:37.705 --> 02:10:38.105]  Amazing.
[02:10:38.145 --> 02:10:39.346]  We promised to go to a few of these calls.
[02:10:39.386 --> 02:10:40.846]  We're going to end the show in just a few minutes here.
[02:10:40.986 --> 02:10:43.647]  Quickly, I've just got a new list here.
[02:10:43.667 --> 02:10:44.928]  Let's talk to Leo.
[02:10:45.388 --> 02:10:46.689]  Leo, you're on the air with David Icker.
[02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:47.069]  Go ahead.
[02:10:48.029 --> 02:10:49.770]  Hi, this is Leo from Arcturus.
[02:10:50.070 --> 02:10:51.210]  Okay, let's not screw around.
[02:10:51.250 --> 02:10:53.091]  Go ahead and ask your question to David Icker.
[02:10:53.111 --> 02:10:53.831]  I'm going to move on.
[02:10:54.372 --> 02:10:55.012]  Okay.
[02:10:55.372 --> 02:11:02.835]  I think we should start letting everybody know about Hitler's branches being done in on the
[02:11:03.610 --> 02:11:08.332]  Night of the Long Knives, because that's how we get the police to understand that they're disposable.
[02:11:08.892 --> 02:11:16.516]  And as far as calling people sheeple, it's an insult to sheep, because sheep are way too smart to watch television.
[02:11:17.116 --> 02:11:20.738]  And we should call them asleeple, because they're sleepwalking through life.
[02:11:21.398 --> 02:11:23.259]  I hear you Leo, I appreciate your call.
[02:11:23.719 --> 02:11:29.202]  Yes, the elites, why do elites always terminate the group that helped them bring in the tyranny?
[02:11:30.632 --> 02:11:32.574]  Because they don't want them either.
[02:11:32.654 --> 02:11:35.256]  I mean, you know, this is the thing about elites.
[02:11:35.476 --> 02:11:48.206]  They are as contemptuous, in fact even more so, of those that blindly help them bring in their tyrannies as they are the general population that they tyrannize.
[02:11:48.226 --> 02:11:49.948]  They've got total contempt.
[02:11:49.988 --> 02:11:54.872]  You see, these guys see humans in terms of the way so many humans see cattle.
[02:11:55.773 --> 02:11:58.515]  And, you know, they use the cattle.
[02:11:59.386 --> 02:11:59.586]  I think
[02:12:14.161 --> 02:12:18.785]  Folks, do you respect a cow more or a sheep or do you respect a grizzly bear or a wolf?
[02:12:19.145 --> 02:12:22.528]  Do you respect a killer whale more than you respect a jellyfish?
[02:12:22.929 --> 02:12:27.392]  You see, the elite respect people that fight them and resist them and know what they are.
[02:12:27.432 --> 02:12:30.435]  They think of... and I've had, you know, globalists tell me that.
[02:12:30.495 --> 02:12:31.316]  A few final calls.
[02:12:31.336 --> 02:12:32.797]  Got to let David go in here just a minute.
[02:12:33.197 --> 02:12:34.879]  This is just amazing information.
[02:12:35.599 --> 02:12:39.283]  Let's talk to, up next, Robert in Kentucky.
[02:12:39.303 --> 02:12:39.883]  You're on the air.
[02:12:39.923 --> 02:12:40.283]  Go ahead.
[02:12:41.364 --> 02:12:42.084]  Oh, great.
[02:12:42.564 --> 02:12:44.865]  Alex, David, I'm a big fan of both of yours.
[02:12:45.005 --> 02:12:46.085]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[02:12:46.826 --> 02:12:52.027]  I just wanted to know, David, from your perspective, I'm glad you brought up the reptilian.
[02:12:53.267 --> 02:12:54.208]  Last week, the U.S.
[02:12:54.248 --> 02:12:59.009]  military cut off all information on incoming foreign bodies.
[02:12:59.349 --> 02:13:01.591]  Yes, that was in the Associated Press and NASA.
[02:13:02.171 --> 02:13:05.234]  All meteor storms, you know, they have them every year.
[02:13:05.774 --> 02:13:12.259]  Everything's classified coming into the atmosphere now and all the rocks that come into the planet that they put on the news.
[02:13:12.660 --> 02:13:14.781]  Now national security, David.
[02:13:14.801 --> 02:13:15.582]  I know you saw that.
[02:13:15.862 --> 02:13:17.263]  What do you... Sorry, caller.
[02:13:17.283 --> 02:13:17.524]  Go ahead.
[02:13:19.185 --> 02:13:26.287]  Do you think that, what is your perspective on that playing into the return of the Anadarki, the gods?
[02:13:28.008 --> 02:13:29.929]  Like I said, I'll take the answer on that.
[02:13:38.783 --> 02:13:54.494]  We are not the only life species in this universe, but you know, people see visible light as the universe, and like I say, the universe is visible light plus all the dark matter, which is the vast majority of this universe,
[02:13:56.936 --> 02:13:58.218]  We're good to go.
[02:14:18.078 --> 02:14:18.699]  We're good to go.
[02:14:41.425 --> 02:14:47.108]  Well, now that we've gotten off into this realm, we are on a planet in the middle of the universe with billions of galaxies around us.
[02:14:47.188 --> 02:14:48.409]  And, Collar, I appreciate your call.
[02:14:48.769 --> 02:14:53.171]  In closing, David, is there anybody going to come help us from the evil reptoid rulers?
[02:14:53.191 --> 02:14:54.311]  I mean, anybody going to save us?
[02:14:54.372 --> 02:14:55.912]  I guess that's up to us to do.
[02:14:56.593 --> 02:14:58.534]  I don't think we need saving.
[02:14:58.874 --> 02:15:00.895]  I think the means is already there.
[02:15:00.955 --> 02:15:02.195]  It's called becoming conscious.
[02:15:02.776 --> 02:15:07.198]  And, you see, there's a reason why these guys are terrified of us becoming conscious, and they work
[02:15:07.798 --> 02:15:13.782]  So desperately hard, more so than ever before, because they have to, to keep us asleep.
[02:15:14.243 --> 02:15:16.984]  Because when we wake up, it's over for them.
[02:15:17.024 --> 02:15:17.605]  They know that.
[02:15:17.925 --> 02:15:21.287]  I don't fully know the reason, but there's a reason they're terrified of us.
[02:15:21.688 --> 02:15:24.850]  Because of powers that humans have that they do not have.
[02:15:25.490 --> 02:15:28.973]  And certainly when you are in the depths
[02:15:30.545 --> 02:15:40.993]  I don't like using the word evil, but the depth of imbalance that they're in and sickness, they cannot even begin to access consciousness.
[02:15:41.033 --> 02:15:47.377]  They're so far away from it vibrationally because of the density their state of mind puts them in.
[02:15:47.417 --> 02:15:51.059]  Well, David, since you brought up the Garden of Eden and
[02:15:52.932 --> 02:15:57.495]  You know, the issue here is we're made in the image of God.
[02:15:57.515 --> 02:16:06.500]  I mean, if you really interpret the Bible that way, are we a copy or some manifestation of something else that's on other planets?
[02:16:07.315 --> 02:16:24.067]  Well, you see, I think this whole universe, this whole reality, this whole infinite awareness is just so extraordinary compared with what we've been led to believe through our lives.
[02:16:24.107 --> 02:16:34.194]  You see, you know, even religions and all these different ways of seeing God and life, we've got to remember that these have all developed
[02:16:34.654 --> 02:16:34.954]  We're good.
[02:16:49.964 --> 02:16:59.007]  Then, and you've hinted at it a few times, the things you've said in the show, you start to see the full, incredible magnitude of what we're part of.
[02:16:59.047 --> 02:17:02.068]  Not just what we're part of, but what we are.
[02:17:02.448 --> 02:17:12.072]  And it's preventing us from that realization, that self-realization that we are infinite consciousness, that they work so hard to do.
[02:17:12.132 --> 02:17:16.493]  Because if they didn't, and they weren't successful at doing it, then what they do would be impossible.
[02:17:16.903 --> 02:17:22.285]  Well, it's like Bill Hicks said, then you figure out that it's just a ride, and people are like, shut up, kill him, shut him up.
[02:17:22.305 --> 02:17:22.766]  Exactly.
[02:17:22.806 --> 02:17:24.306]  I got a lot invested in this ride.
[02:17:24.607 --> 02:17:25.167]  Exactly.
[02:17:25.227 --> 02:17:28.388]  You know, I mean, how many Christians would kill Jesus if he came back, you know?
[02:17:29.149 --> 02:17:29.729]  I mean, please.
[02:17:30.646 --> 02:17:32.447]  Well, David Icke, I'm not going to go to any more calls.
[02:17:32.507 --> 02:17:34.447]  I apologize to Bridget, Maria, and Ryan and Tim.
[02:17:34.487 --> 02:17:35.588]  We've kept David too long.
[02:17:36.048 --> 02:17:40.930]  And just always an amazing having you on, coming to the United States in October.
[02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:42.550]  Details at DavidIcke.com.
[02:17:43.010 --> 02:17:47.692]  God bless you, David, and we appreciate your time coming on with us.
[02:17:47.952 --> 02:17:49.633]  Do we know the name of the new book coming out?
[02:17:50.073 --> 02:17:53.034]  I've got a working title, but I might change it, so I'll keep it to myself.
[02:17:53.494 --> 02:17:56.375]  But I'll be finished by September for sure.
[02:17:57.279 --> 02:18:01.702]  Okay, well, we look forward to having you back on in the next few months as soon as it's done.
[02:18:02.403 --> 02:18:04.605]  And, uh, be careful, my friend.
[02:18:04.965 --> 02:18:05.425]  Okay, mate.
[02:18:05.465 --> 02:18:05.906]  Cheers, Alex.
[02:18:06.026 --> 02:18:06.206]  Bye.
[02:18:06.546 --> 02:18:06.886]  Take care.
[02:18:06.906 --> 02:18:07.467]  There he goes.
[02:18:08.928 --> 02:18:20.016]  Ladies and gentlemen, going where this show has not gone before, but I think it's important for people to just expand their paradigms, question everything, and that's what we've done with David Icke today.
[02:18:21.377 --> 02:18:22.678]  Jason Burma's back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:18:22.738 --> 02:18:24.059]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:18:24.079 --> 02:18:24.700]  to 3 p.m.
[02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:25.840]  Central Standard Time.
[02:18:26.701 --> 02:18:40.555]  The biggest issue is all this petty governmental crap doesn't matter when you realize we're on a planet hurtling at twenty-something thousand miles an hour through space in the cosmos experiencing
[02:18:41.815 --> 02:18:44.598]  Even the limited spectrum is unbelievable!
[02:18:45.038 --> 02:18:51.905]  So stop feeling inadequate, and thank the Creator, thank the Maker, every day that you were given the gift of consciousness.
[02:18:52.405 --> 02:18:53.266]  Great job, crew!
[02:18:53.706 --> 02:18:55.128]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off.
[02:18:55.528 --> 02:18:57.510]  Until next time, happy trails!
[02:19:09.742 --> 02:19:10.223]  Yeah.
