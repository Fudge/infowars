[00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:00.588]  I'm scumming.
[00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:30.645]  We are simulcasting now for the next two hours and 27 minutes at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting this live syndicated radio show and
[00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:39.477]  This radio program is exploding in popularity just as Liberty and the love affair with it is exploding across the planet as well.
[00:00:39.877 --> 00:00:46.421]  In a moment we'll talk to Lew Rockwell, former congressional chief of staff to Ron Paul and founder and chairman of the Lubing von Mies Institute.
[00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:53.444]  It goes on and on, so we'll be talking to him right now about the Federal Reserve, auditing the Fed, Ron Paul, and so much more.
[00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:55.165]  And your phone call is coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:56.626]  He'll be with us for 45 minutes.
[00:00:56.926 --> 00:00:58.787]  But I want to be clear here.
[00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:01.733]  I want to thank everybody.
[00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:05.337]  I've already done an hour and a half of the show and really haven't gotten into the Money Bomb.
[00:01:05.877 --> 00:01:06.978]  This is our second annual.
[00:01:07.018 --> 00:01:09.201]  The first one was started by listeners.
[00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:11.903]  We embraced it and it raised $250,000.
[00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:20.192]  To be technical, it was like $249,000 and change last year at the same time.
[00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:24.196]  So we're having another Money Bomb today to expand the studio.
[00:01:25.373 --> 00:01:27.593]  To get more webmasters, more video editors.
[00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:30.474]  Instead of making two or three films a year, we want to make six films a year.
[00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:32.535]  And I put my films out for free.
[00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:34.535]  And they're all the number one videos.
[00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:39.776]  Every one of my films is always number one for a time and are among the number one viral videos in history.
[00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:42.257]  Conservatively, we've done the numbers.
[00:01:42.297 --> 00:01:47.138]  Over 200 million views of my films that we can document on YouTube and Google and the other big sites.
[00:01:47.158 --> 00:01:47.398]  200 million.
[00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:52.286]  The Obama Deception has been out for three months.
[00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:58.527]  I checked a month ago, two months in, 15 million views on YouTube, Google, and a few other video sites alone.
[00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:02.828]  There's some with over 3 million, 2 million, 1 million, you know, per video.
[00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:05.289]  But it gets duplicated everywhere, so you've got to go through and count them up.
[00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.349]  Go do it for yourself!
[00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.069]  In fact, one of my writers ought to do that.
[00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:10.190]  It took me 45 minutes to count up 15 million.
[00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.811]  I make a $100,000 film, release it for free,
[00:02:14.963 --> 00:02:16.524]  Because I want liberty, I want freedom.
[00:02:17.144 --> 00:02:20.446]  These are like self-replicating printing presses.
[00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:21.766]  People buy the DVDs.
[00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:28.769]  They gave out $15,000 a loan at Arizona State University in a two-week period ahead of Obama's visit.
[00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.231]  It made the newspapers, it made the radio, it made TV.
[00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:32.171]  They were giving them out.
[00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:33.972]  People were like, why are these DVDs everywhere?
[00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:36.073]  That's happening at colleges everywhere.
[00:02:36.113 --> 00:02:37.534]  See, we can't even count that.
[00:02:38.214 --> 00:02:39.875]  But it's definitely in the tens of millions.
[00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:40.995]  I don't know.
[00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:02.784]  He, that's how he came to power, was copies of cassette tapes passed on.
[00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:04.865]  Well, we're not trying to come to power.
[00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:07.206]  We want the Bill of Rights and Constitution to come back in.
[00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:08.406]  We're restorationists.
[00:03:08.446 --> 00:03:12.288]  We're fighting the revolutionary private offshore crime banking syndicates.
[00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.209]  And we'll get Lou Rockwell's take on that in a moment.
[00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.191]  Let me explain something here.
[00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:18.352]  People want us to make more films.
[00:03:18.372 --> 00:03:19.492]  They want us to write more stories.
[00:03:19.512 --> 00:03:20.413]  They want us to do more.
[00:03:21.073 --> 00:03:33.460]  I got 20 people here, and I spend most of my time trying to raise money, sell advertising, and sell DVDs for people that want to support us and Prison Planet dot TV memberships, instead of fighting the New World Order.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.883]  So it does help us to guarantee we can expand for the year, and it's just essential.
[00:03:39.223 --> 00:03:40.984]  The last money bomb helped us so much.
[00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:42.185]  I hope this one's bigger.
[00:03:42.485 --> 00:03:42.846]  The goal is $250,000.
[00:03:45.487 --> 00:03:46.587]  They update it every hour.
[00:03:46.707 --> 00:03:49.168]  It's about $90,000 right now and growing.
[00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:51.129]  We'll update that in the next hour again.
[00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.291]  And by midnight tonight, I would like to have reached $250,000.
[00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:58.272]  And we'll go to expanding our studios.
[00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:04.394]  We'll go to buying more equipment, hiring two video editors, another webmaster or two, and just doing a lot more around here.
[00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:10.639]  I hate paying the tax man anyway, so we will spend all the money on the infrastructure right here that comes in from the Money Bomb.
[00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:17.985]  So please go to InfoWars.com or InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, link through on the banners, and donate there by PayPal, by credit card.
[00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:23.831]  If you don't like those systems we've got, we've got Yahoo Pay on our Yahoo video and bookstore shopping card.
[00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:29.736]  You can also call toll-free until 1 o'clock tonight central, and we're going to go ahead and run the Money Bomb until 11 a.m.
[00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:30.116]  tomorrow.
[00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.497]  It really has started at 11 a.m.
[00:04:31.517 --> 00:04:31.758]  today.
[00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:33.338]  And it's up to $90,000.
[00:04:33.378 --> 00:04:35.119]  888-201-2244, 888-201-2244 is the toll-free number to call and donate.
[00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.659]  $5, $10, $1,000, whatever you want.
[00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.400]  100% of the Money Bomb money will go towards directly fighting the New World Order.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.001]  So instead of having two or three films that get 30, 40 million views in a year,
[00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:55.505]  How about five or six?
[00:04:56.245 --> 00:05:00.146]  So, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.747]  People say, oh, you shouldn't ask for money.
[00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:06.828]  That's the media trying to bully us into not having free association.
[00:05:07.188 --> 00:05:22.711]  You know, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin and many others went to France and went to countries and would sell little American flags and trinkets and signatures to raise money and ship it back over to buy the most basic armaments in the Revolutionary War.
[00:05:23.744 --> 00:05:28.751]  Ron Paul, others have to go around and campaign and raise money for their campaigns.
[00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:29.893]  And it takes up all your time.
[00:05:30.153 --> 00:05:31.035]  It takes treasure.
[00:05:31.615 --> 00:05:37.624]  And it's an enemy psyop to say that we shouldn't ask for money and we shouldn't raise money.
[00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:53.004]  We're not the IRS for the private Federal Reserve coming and taking your money and then using it for fake news and buying reporters and propaganda and ad council ads to join Barack Obama's private youth brigade armies in red and black uniforms now knocking on doors nationwide.
[00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:55.226]  People marching on TV in red and black uniforms.
[00:05:55.286 --> 00:05:56.247]  It's happening.
[00:05:56.868 --> 00:05:58.730]  The unthinkable is manifesting.
[00:05:59.616 --> 00:06:00.416]  They're using our money.
[00:06:00.597 --> 00:06:08.001]  George Soros spends millions putting out carbon credit, carbon tax movies about how humans have got to be gotten rid of and we're evil, and they're setting up climate cops.
[00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:11.723]  His millions, though, can be countered by your hundreds of thousands.
[00:06:12.797 --> 00:06:18.239]  And, uh, I will continue to put my films out for free, and if you want to buy the DVD to support us, that's great, and it's the higher quality.
[00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:23.001]  But regardless, I know it's the biggest effect, so I'll continue to do it, but we'll put out more if you support us.
[00:06:23.041 --> 00:06:29.764]  So, InfoWars.com, to link through to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, or 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, or 512-646-1776, 512-646-1776, if the numbers are busy, just please call back a few minutes later.
[00:06:29.784 --> 00:06:31.405]  We've got five people on the phones in there.
[00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:43.730]  $5, $100, whatever you can.
[00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.351]  This is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:47.111]  We supported Ron Paul's money bombs.
[00:06:47.131 --> 00:06:48.512]  People say, oh well he didn't win, we failed.
[00:06:48.552 --> 00:06:48.752]  No, no.
[00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:52.734]  You see the delayed, we're about to go to Lou Rockwell, the delayed response.
[00:06:53.743 --> 00:06:54.104]  I don't
[00:07:14.713 --> 00:07:14.953]  I think?
[00:07:30.464 --> 00:07:34.046]  This is how we change society, and we're in a revolution, folks, against tyranny.
[00:07:34.467 --> 00:07:45.274]  Lew Rockwell, thanks for holding while I put that call out for the money bomb, but can you comment about the fact that we get to be hesitant and have been buffaloed into not asking for support, but we need to learn how to do that?
[00:07:46.214 --> 00:07:50.697]  Well, the bad guys, of course, are all supported by the tax system, by stolen money, in other words.
[00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:52.138]  That's what taxes are.
[00:07:52.178 --> 00:07:56.541]  It's a coercive mechanism whereby people in the government get to put a gun to your head and say,
[00:07:58.525 --> 00:07:58.966]  I think so.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.451]  This, of course, is the voluntary and the humane and the prosperous and the free way to get money.
[00:08:24.511 --> 00:08:29.118]  So, of course, that's the way it ought to be done, not through the government mechanism.
[00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:32.345]  Absolutely, and the establishment knows that.
[00:08:32.365 --> 00:08:40.490]  They're scared to death that real organizations are going to get funded, that we make films and sell books, that Ron Paul does it or has newsletters.
[00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:47.454]  I mean, that is such a psyop to say no one who's against big government is allowed to fund their operations.
[00:08:47.754 --> 00:08:49.075]  What a mind game, Lou!
[00:08:49.656 --> 00:08:53.378]  You know, Alex, I was so glad to hear you mention Ron's forthcoming book and the Fed.
[00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:56.592]  Which is really an extraordinary work.
[00:08:56.652 --> 00:08:59.873]  I mean, I got a chance to see a proof.
[00:09:00.454 --> 00:09:02.855]  It's just an extraordinary piece of work.
[00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:13.599]  What Ron does is he weaves history and economics and the Constitution together with his own life experiences from the time he was a little boy to today on Capitol Hill.
[00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:17.863]  Well, I had Congressman Paul on yesterday, graciously in his busy schedule, and I made the point that
[00:09:36.713 --> 00:09:46.678]  Even if they shoot this down and play dirty tricks, and CNBC is saying Fed would be shut down if it were audited, experts say society would collapse, they're saying, on other news programs.
[00:09:47.358 --> 00:10:04.367]  I mean, obviously they may pull a chicanery and beat it this time, but the idea of this alien, offshore, above the law, arrogant group that's engineered the crisis we're under, now posing as our saviors, no matter what they do, it's inexorable that their days are numbered.
[00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:19.376]  Well, you know, it's important to remember that, and of course there are many evil institutions in Washington, D.C., whether it's the IRS or the EPA or the HUD or the rest of the alphabet from hell, or the Pentagon, all the rest of them.
[00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:24.777]  But the worst thing in Washington, the worst operation that goes on there is the Federal Reserve.
[00:10:24.797 --> 00:10:29.939]  It is the Federal Reserve that makes possible this biggest government in the history of the world, the U.S.
[00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:30.179]  government.
[00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:33.278]  It's the Federal Reserve that makes possible world wars.
[00:10:33.678 --> 00:10:38.421]  It's the Federal Reserve that makes possible all the crazy environmental stuff that they're engineering now.
[00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:41.962]  Without a Federal Reserve, they wouldn't be talking about socializing medical care.
[00:10:42.363 --> 00:10:46.325]  It's the brain, the heart, the stomach, everything.
[00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:48.586]  And the IRS is the mouth feeding it.
[00:10:48.646 --> 00:10:48.926]  Go ahead.
[00:10:49.466 --> 00:10:51.007]  Well, it's the Fed that makes profit.
[00:10:51.027 --> 00:10:52.108]  It's the printing press.
[00:10:52.409 --> 00:10:55.731]  But we can think of the Fed as being nothing other than a counterfeiting press.
[00:10:56.132 --> 00:11:01.416]  It's like a counterfeiter in the basement in a local town hurting the local economy with its phony money.
[00:11:02.056 --> 00:11:03.157]  Only global.
[00:11:03.197 --> 00:11:09.182]  I mean, on a global scale, they put out trillions of dollars of money just created out of thin air.
[00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:11.704]  And, of course, it benefits the government itself.
[00:11:11.784 --> 00:11:18.210]  It benefits the big banks, the military-industrial complex, all the rest of the people associated with the central state in Washington.
[00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:23.295]  At the expense of the American people, and really the people of the whole world end up paying for this.
[00:11:23.656 --> 00:11:36.229]  And it's a rip-off, it's a transfer of funds from poor people, elderly people, rural people, other groups that aren't blessed in our society, to the most powerful and the richest people connected to the government.
[00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:41.613]  His predecessor was called by Andrew Jackson, the monster.
[00:11:41.953 --> 00:11:44.415]  And I always think that's a good phrase for the Federal Reserve, too.
[00:11:44.835 --> 00:11:47.417]  I mean, it causes the business cycle.
[00:11:47.917 --> 00:11:52.380]  It's because of the Federal Reserve that we now have this horrific financial crisis we're in.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.261]  They caused the artificial boom.
[00:11:54.301 --> 00:11:55.581]  They caused the housing boom.
[00:11:55.982 --> 00:11:57.543]  They caused the dot-com boom.
[00:11:57.823 --> 00:11:59.464]  They caused the Great Depression.
[00:12:00.244 --> 00:12:02.025]  Ever since the Federal Reserve was established in 1913,
[00:12:03.743 --> 00:12:19.906]  We, it's caused a huge series of booms and busts, and of course you can't really tell how much poorer we are because of the Federal Reserve and its ability to pump up the government and cause these booms and busts, but we're probably two or three times poorer than a very, very conservative estimate.
[00:12:19.946 --> 00:12:28.008]  Every American, we would all be a much richer society if it weren't for the group of criminals called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:31.008]  Absolutely.
[00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:46.217]  Expanding on that, you of course run the Ludwig von Mies Institute, full of top, world-renowned economists, people that research this, but just studying basic history, it's not even a hidden fact that we didn't really have a business cycle.
[00:12:46.257 --> 00:12:50.059]  It was explosive, 10% growth on average, completely stable money.
[00:12:51.139 --> 00:13:08.435]  Absolute milk and honey, 4% of the world's population got half the wealth of the world, 80 plus percent of the patents, just huge levels of high education from homeschooling, the apple of the world's eye, then colonized by the Federal Reserve
[00:13:08.775 --> 00:13:13.099]  Takeover in 1913, they engineered the 33 Collapse War Powers Act.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:23.930]  They brag in IMF and World Bank documents and hundred-year-old American Banking Association documents that we have, that they love booms and busts to get you inflated and blow it out and consolidate.
[00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:33.079]  This is a predatory group of shysters, of magicians engaging in scams and chicanery who bamboozle and scam the public.
[00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:33.839]  I think?
[00:13:51.953 --> 00:14:01.424]  You know, Patriot System, the whole Homeland Security apparatus we discover from the documents we broke is for veterans, gun owners, conservatives, Ron Paul, libertarians, yourself, myself.
[00:14:01.904 --> 00:14:11.875]  I mean, we now know this offshore alien corporation is setting up and preparing to make war upon the American people if we try to ever kick the bankers out or bring them to justice.
[00:14:11.915 --> 00:14:12.456]  Lou Rockwell.
[00:14:12.876 --> 00:14:19.498]  Well, Alex, you know, I think that Ron Paul ignited a prairie fire against the Federal Reserve in his presidential campaign.
[00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:27.219]  And I think back to his speech after the Dearborn, in October 2007, the Dearborn Republican primary debate.
[00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:32.481]  He went to the University of Michigan afterwards, and there were about 4,000 kids in the quad there to hear him.
[00:14:32.821 --> 00:14:34.941]  A lot of kids think you're a politician, we were told.
[00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:40.563]  And so Ron starts talking about foreign policy, about the free market, everybody's cheering him.
[00:14:41.243 --> 00:14:42.223]  And then all of a sudden,
[00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:43.501]  We're good to go.
[00:15:06.016 --> 00:15:15.061]  And I fed movement in its size, its excitement, and its possibilities, to that moment in the quad at the University of Michigan, when these kids responded to Ron Paul.
[00:15:15.502 --> 00:15:17.163]  And I'll tell you, it bothers the Fed.
[00:15:17.223 --> 00:15:28.589]  There was a great article, great from, I mean, sort of the opposite, bad article, but great from our standpoint, in Forbes, where they said, look, it's time for the Fed to be boring again.
[00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.051]  People should not be interested in the Fed.
[00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:35.674]  They can't do their wonderful work for humanity if they're being scrutinized.
[00:15:36.054 --> 00:15:38.636]  So Ron Paul's bill to audit the Fed is terrible.
[00:15:39.076 --> 00:15:44.259]  All interest in the Fed, picked up by professional economists, should be discouraged.
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:51.224]  Of course, the Fed is not boring, although they'd like us to think it's boring, because they're ripping us off.
[00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.686]  And Ron Paul is the engine of this movement.
[00:15:55.106 --> 00:16:06.071]  That has just swept the country and all over the world, as a matter of fact, where people want to know about the Fed, want transparency, and the ones who really understand the Fed.
[00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:11.853]  And I want to mention a great book by Thomas Woods at the Mises Institute called Meltdown about this recent crisis.
[00:16:12.433 --> 00:16:15.135]  We're going to be having him on.
[00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:16.556]  Yeah, I know that.
[00:16:16.576 --> 00:16:21.920]  This is another great book to read, but there is a strong anti-Fed movement.
[00:16:22.301 --> 00:16:23.241]  It's getting stronger.
[00:16:23.581 --> 00:16:26.964]  Whatever these birds do in Congress is not the heart of it.
[00:16:27.304 --> 00:16:29.066]  The heart of it is among the American people.
[00:16:29.366 --> 00:16:30.687]  They're scared at the Fed.
[00:16:31.327 --> 00:16:33.848]  They've hired a lobbyist to try to block Ron Paul.
[00:16:34.108 --> 00:16:36.489]  You have Bernanke going on 60 minutes twice.
[00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:40.510]  Never in the history of the Fed has a Fed chairman appeared on a regular media show like that.
[00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.411]  And Lou, I want to ask you this, and I agree with you.
[00:16:42.911 --> 00:16:48.293]  This is going to backfire, and they've gone from their arrogance above the Congress to scared.
[00:16:48.693 --> 00:16:55.015]  That air of invincibility, that air of arrogance, that veneer of royalty has now left them.
[00:16:55.295 --> 00:16:57.196]  People are realizing they're not invincible.
[00:16:57.916 --> 00:16:59.517]  So, let's talk Turkey.
[00:17:00.038 --> 00:17:01.439]  How are they going to counter us?
[00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:08.584]  And their answer is, same way they got the banker takeover October 3rd, we're going to have a depression if you audit us, and you're white supremacist if you do.
[00:17:08.924 --> 00:17:12.187]  That's why they've seized on this Von Brun deranged person.
[00:17:12.207 --> 00:17:17.951]  I mean, you've got, in polls, the Fed is 60-70% unpopular.
[00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:20.413]  I guess 70% of Americans are white supremacists?
[00:17:20.753 --> 00:17:22.515]  I think that's going to backfire on them as well.
[00:17:23.427 --> 00:17:36.519]  Well, I think that just the fact that Americans are learning what this institution does, that it's not just a name on the bill in your pocket, but it's actually the greatest rip-off engine in the history of the world, working against us every day.
[00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:41.184]  As people get interested in it, they begin to understand it, they want to abolish it.
[00:17:41.204 --> 00:17:47.590]  It's unconstitutional, it's immoral, it's bad politically, it's hurtful in every way.
[00:17:48.951 --> 00:17:57.733]  Alright, he's the head of the Lubitvang Mies Institute, and he is a best-selling author in his own right, and also the former congressional chief of staff for Ron Paul.
[00:17:58.234 --> 00:17:59.134]  Lou Rockwell.
[00:17:59.674 --> 00:18:00.514]  Always love having him.
[00:18:00.534 --> 00:18:03.195]  Stay there, Lou will be right back and talk about the game plan.
[00:18:03.475 --> 00:18:04.595]  How we beat the bankers.
[00:18:04.895 --> 00:18:05.816]  How we bring them down.
[00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:06.696]  How we end the Fed.
[00:18:07.056 --> 00:18:07.536]  Hoorah!
[00:18:07.656 --> 00:18:10.037]  Are you concerned for the safety of your loved ones?

[00:19:03.051 --> 00:19:13.335]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:19:13.835 --> 00:19:20.818]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:19:21.394 --> 00:19:27.597]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:19:27.998 --> 00:19:29.819]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:19:29.959 --> 00:19:32.380]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:43.426]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:19:44.042 --> 00:19:45.323]  It's not about left or right.
[00:19:45.704 --> 00:19:47.105]  It's about a one world government.
[00:19:47.565 --> 00:19:53.931]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:57.085]  Coming up the next hour, we'll take about 15-20 minutes of calls with Lou Rockwell for those that are patiently holding at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:21:57.445 --> 00:22:02.588]  Lou, I know you're trying to focus on the positive here, but I don't know what the media is doing.
[00:22:03.068 --> 00:22:04.569]  You have the DHS report.
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:29.999]  uh... that we broke in the my report we broken all the others and i've been seeing these for years as nobody would pay attention to him until now where they're saying ron paul conservatives libertarians in the fed groups i got secret documents in the army confirm that the bar me was spying on ron paul last year at the end the fed meeting uh... in houston and spying on us in dallas and are in the fed meeting as potential terrorist
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.842]  So they put this script out.
[00:22:32.962 --> 00:22:34.323]  I know that blew up in their face.
[00:22:35.224 --> 00:22:41.489]  But still, this does show that they consider us to be a real threat and are trying to sick the Defense Department on us.
[00:22:42.349 --> 00:22:44.671]  But at the same time saying vets are the number one threat.
[00:22:45.932 --> 00:22:49.595]  And all these anti-gun bills introduced and all this draconian stuff going on.
[00:22:49.615 --> 00:22:51.577]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:22:52.731 --> 00:23:01.920]  Well, America's been, unfortunately, at least a soft fascist state since Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal, and it's been getting worse since then.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:06.625]  There have been stops and starts, and back, step forward, step backward, and so forth.
[00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:08.107]  So yeah, we have, we have...
[00:23:10.114 --> 00:23:12.516]  Again, the biggest government in the history of the world, the U.S.
[00:23:12.556 --> 00:23:13.797]  government, it hates dissent.
[00:23:14.197 --> 00:23:21.744]  It wants all of us to be good little boys and girls, turn over our wallets, turn over our children for their wars, obey them, listen to them, and salute them.
[00:23:21.764 --> 00:23:23.345]  I mean, that's the way they want things.
[00:23:23.705 --> 00:23:24.906]  So anybody who is a dissident...
[00:23:26.267 --> 00:23:28.649]  Whether from the left or the right is hated.
[00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.892]  And of course they want to, you know, they don't like us.
[00:23:32.432 --> 00:23:34.734]  And we can't trust, obviously, the mainstream media.
[00:23:34.754 --> 00:23:41.099]  In effect, a state media operation, no different from the ones in some other countries.
[00:23:41.699 --> 00:23:42.760]  They're giving out lies.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.803]  They smear anybody who's opposed to the federal government.
[00:23:46.863 --> 00:23:47.724]  It's Federal Reserve.
[00:23:47.764 --> 00:23:48.325]  It's wars.
[00:23:48.805 --> 00:23:50.646]  It's all the... It's spying.
[00:23:51.527 --> 00:23:52.268]  It's welfare.
[00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:54.083]  Economic transfers.
[00:23:54.744 --> 00:23:55.565]  Destructionism.
[00:23:56.046 --> 00:23:57.789]  They're a terrible bunch in the government.
[00:23:58.149 --> 00:24:01.795]  And yeah, they don't like us saying them nay, but here's the good news.
[00:24:02.757 --> 00:24:04.820]  Government depends on the consent of the government.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.022]  They actually depend on at least the tacit consent of the people.
[00:24:09.443 --> 00:24:16.508]  And if the people ever start to withdraw that consent, they get terrified, and they can be brought down.
[00:24:17.248 --> 00:24:20.010]  You know, you mentioned the Ayatollah Khomeini a little bit ago.
[00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:27.455]  Obviously not exactly our cup of tea, the Ayatollah Khomeini, but the way he brought down the Shah, the dictatorship the U.S.
[00:24:27.495 --> 00:24:33.079]  government had set up, by the way, in Iran, a monstrous government with horrible torture and secret police and
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:39.957]  And punishing businessmen for raising prices against their horrendous paper money inflation.
[00:24:41.327 --> 00:24:47.511]  The way that the Ayatollah Khomeini brought it was changing people's minds, as you say, through these cassette tapes, which were an important part of it.
[00:24:47.951 --> 00:24:55.517]  They changed people's minds, and when the people of Iran withdrew their consent from the Shah, the whole government disappeared like a bunch of leaves in the wind.
[00:24:55.537 --> 00:24:57.318]  It didn't matter, he had secret police.
[00:24:57.338 --> 00:24:59.580]  It didn't matter, he had vast armies.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:04.664]  Because the number of people who were... You know, the government is a parasite, it's an economic parasite.
[00:25:05.264 --> 00:25:08.927]  And just so they can live in the style to which they are accustomed,
[00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:12.015]  They had to be far fewer parasites than the hosts.
[00:25:12.635 --> 00:25:16.777]  We hosts vastly outnumber the parasites of the government.
[00:25:16.797 --> 00:25:24.680]  And they know it, and they fear us, and if we start to withdraw our consent, as is happening with the Federal Reserve, they are in big trouble.
[00:25:26.021 --> 00:25:30.723]  Absolutely, and the more they try to hide it, the more they try to scum with the truth, the more it blows up in their face.
[00:25:32.813 --> 00:25:34.094]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:25:57.418 --> 00:26:02.421]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:26:02.641 --> 00:26:06.423]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:26:06.663 --> 00:26:12.267]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:26:12.567 --> 00:26:13.007]  It's true.
[00:26:13.207 --> 00:26:17.409]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:18.130]  Number three,
[00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:23.973]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:26:24.834 --> 00:26:27.476]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:26:27.736 --> 00:26:31.138]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:35.841]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:26:36.101 --> 00:26:41.583]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[00:27:30.213 --> 00:27:35.976]  Lou Rockwell of lourockwell.com and the Varmese Institute on Ron Paul's right hand.
[00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:43.500]  Men is joining us today for another 20 minutes or so to take a few calls in the next segment.
[00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:47.623]  Mr. Rockwell, you know you say people are waking up to the tyranny and I agree with you.
[00:27:47.643 --> 00:27:49.744]  I see an awakening that's exponential.
[00:27:50.405 --> 00:27:51.205]  It's parabolic.
[00:27:52.126 --> 00:27:53.306]  But the system doesn't care.
[00:27:53.907 --> 00:27:57.629]  And it's got a lot of brainwashed paramilitary police on power trips who'll do what they're told.
[00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:02.773]  I remember watching Governor Ridge six years ago, Homeland Security had just been set up publicly,
[00:28:03.755 --> 00:28:09.578]  As we know, Clinton gave speeches about it in 93 and 94, how Northcom, how they wanted to set it up and have an army on the streets of America.
[00:28:09.598 --> 00:28:10.939]  This has all been planned bipartisan.
[00:28:11.519 --> 00:28:27.407]  But the key here is, he said to have a job, you'll have to have an ID card, buy and sell, total control, we're going to track and categorize everything you do, and what you see in the airports, that type of security, it's going to be in the malls, in the bus terminals, in the subways.
[00:28:27.507 --> 00:28:31.589]  And now in Boston, New York, Houston, Dallas, they have these Viper teams,
[00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:33.589]  Federal Marshals, others.
[00:28:33.929 --> 00:28:35.790]  TSA, as you know, is taking over.
[00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.811]  And they're saying everyone in New York, everyone in Boston will now be searched.
[00:28:40.411 --> 00:28:44.692]  I have, um, PATH stations to run security screening tests.
[00:28:45.132 --> 00:28:47.612]  Cutting edge, passive millimeter wave technology.
[00:28:47.632 --> 00:28:50.653]  This is the one that scans your naked body, puts it on a hard drive.
[00:28:50.673 --> 00:28:51.833]  I mean, it's more human than human.
[00:28:52.093 --> 00:28:56.434]  I say more human, it even shows the pores on a woman's breast and your genitalia.
[00:28:56.914 --> 00:28:57.976]  Total humiliation.
[00:28:58.016 --> 00:29:05.709]  People are going to march their sons and daughters through even, I guess, so the feds will now have a biometric 360 scan of our body.
[00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.032]  Your comments on that, Lew Rockwell.
[00:29:08.871 --> 00:29:13.776]  Well, you know, we have to remember that the central government is, in effect, a criminal gang.
[00:29:14.297 --> 00:29:22.745]  It lives off theft by taxation, and it lives off lying by propaganda, and there's no end to what they would like to do to us.
[00:29:22.785 --> 00:29:30.193]  So, yes, there's the nude pictures at the airport and so forth, where they're all, I'm sure, yucking it up and passing things around.
[00:29:31.494 --> 00:29:42.176]  It's just that, I mean, it's a peek at what the government is like, but if you sort of think of it like the mafia, only the mafia, I don't want to condemn the mafia too much because they actually provide services people want to buy.
[00:29:42.457 --> 00:29:46.978]  The government doesn't provide services people want to buy, that's why it wants to use force to get your money.
[00:29:47.818 --> 00:29:52.919]  So, again, this is a bunch that thinks nothing, for example, of killing a million people in Iraq.
[00:29:54.352 --> 00:29:56.793]  Unfortunately, not too many Americans care about that either.
[00:29:56.813 --> 00:29:58.833]  They're killing people in Afghanistan.
[00:29:59.213 --> 00:30:02.614]  They have these 700 military bases all over the world.
[00:30:03.154 --> 00:30:08.995]  And, you know, it's a killing operation as well as a theft operation, the government.
[00:30:09.275 --> 00:30:11.796]  So I think we all have to realize that nothing is beyond them.
[00:30:12.136 --> 00:30:20.118]  And the only way that we have any chance of holding them back is by teaching ourselves, by learning what's going on, by reading, by watching.
[00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:25.282]  And by being observant and just becoming aware of everything.
[00:30:25.522 --> 00:30:27.064]  And not buying any other tricks.
[00:30:27.264 --> 00:30:29.266]  I mean, let's talk about some of the tricks.
[00:30:29.566 --> 00:30:38.633]  Because they have constant tricks, but for those that don't know, the news only shows you a still image on the screen of your genitalia and says, yeah, you're naked to set that precedent of humiliation.
[00:30:38.673 --> 00:30:41.156]  Taking the shoes off is a submission ritual.
[00:30:41.216 --> 00:30:43.998]  I've read the psychological warfare documents on that that have been leaked.
[00:30:44.298 --> 00:30:45.960]  It's all about training you to be a slave.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:55.119]  To answer questions, to be lined up, but what they really have is a 360 naked image of you for their biometric cameras to identify you on the street.
[00:30:55.179 --> 00:30:55.660]  Go ahead, Lou.
[00:30:56.539 --> 00:30:59.642]  Well, it's true, and I, you know, that whole shoe business is of course ridiculous.
[00:31:00.062 --> 00:31:05.867]  I have a friend who said, thank goodness that guy didn't, uh, didn't try a pants bomb, you know, versus a shoe bomb.
[00:31:05.887 --> 00:31:12.874]  So, it's, uh, yeah, but, you know, if you go to the airport, you understand exactly how the federal government would like all of society.
[00:31:12.914 --> 00:31:18.038]  That is, you're in a line, you're subservient, if you even look them in the eye, you're in danger.
[00:31:18.058 --> 00:31:19.279]  You have to do everything they say.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.721]  There's no freedom of speech.
[00:31:21.381 --> 00:31:23.703]  And it's all socialized, of course, with the socialists.
[00:31:24.103 --> 00:31:25.344]  It's the way communism is run.
[00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:29.407]  The PSA is a socialist operation, like everything else from the federal government.
[00:31:29.848 --> 00:31:32.670]  The Pentagon, these are all socialist operations.
[00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:42.998]  And just like socialism all over the world, national socialism, international socialism, this is a very crude, a very brutal bunch.
[00:31:43.018 --> 00:31:45.400]  And, you know, they would like us all to be their victims.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.261]  However, we don't have to be their victims.
[00:31:47.381 --> 00:31:53.408]  Well, what about 10th Amendment challenges to the TSA waddling around with their illegal alien screeners?
[00:31:54.028 --> 00:31:55.770]  And that's come out in the news, a lot of them are illegal aliens.
[00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.612]  Yeah, well, magnificent 10th Amendment challenges.
[00:31:58.093 --> 00:31:58.873]  Yeah, yeah, stay there.
[00:31:58.913 --> 00:32:01.016]  Lou Rockwell, always amazing to talk to Lou Rockwell.
[00:32:01.056 --> 00:32:02.417]  Your call's coming up and a lot more.
[00:32:02.858 --> 00:32:03.618]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:16.662]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:32:16.862 --> 00:32:19.726]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:32:19.906 --> 00:32:24.633]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:32:24.853 --> 00:32:25.794]  If you simply prepare.
[00:32:25.974 --> 00:32:28.936]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:32:29.216 --> 00:32:36.122]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:34:07.154 --> 00:34:15.839]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.962]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[00:34:21.422 --> 00:34:23.984]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[00:34:24.404 --> 00:34:26.025]  Actually results in disease.

[00:35:15.462 --> 00:35:16.563]  Government cover-ups.
[00:35:17.223 --> 00:35:18.044]  You want answers?
[00:35:18.784 --> 00:35:19.765]  Well, so does he.
[00:35:19.785 --> 00:35:24.008]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:24.548 --> 00:35:28.591]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35:32.526 --> 00:35:37.975]  I want to thank all the listeners that are supporting us with the InfoWarsMoneyBomb, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:35:38.035 --> 00:35:39.498]  This is the day once a year.
[00:35:39.518 --> 00:35:45.087]  Do you want to see us put out three or four more films the caliber of the Obama deception?
[00:35:46.004 --> 00:35:47.064]  To wake people up?
[00:35:47.484 --> 00:35:51.105]  You want to see us continue to expand the radio show and make the websites even better?
[00:35:51.446 --> 00:35:53.786]  Then buy the books and videos and materials there on the site.
[00:35:54.286 --> 00:35:55.607]  But listeners keep saying they want to donate.
[00:35:55.627 --> 00:35:56.727]  They keep saying have a money bomb.
[00:35:57.047 --> 00:35:57.967]  We're having one.
[00:35:57.987 --> 00:35:58.788]  Today's the day.
[00:35:58.848 --> 00:35:59.028]  June 11, 2009.
[00:36:00.588 --> 00:36:03.629]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com or infowars.com.
[00:36:03.649 --> 00:36:04.309]  You can link through it.
[00:36:04.649 --> 00:36:06.610]  Prisonplanet.com as well.
[00:36:08.032 --> 00:36:09.713]  We're going to run this money bomb from 11 a.m.
[00:36:09.733 --> 00:36:10.753]  today to 11 a.m.
[00:36:10.773 --> 00:36:13.214]  tomorrow, but now is the time to give.
[00:36:13.775 --> 00:36:15.876]  It is getting up there at right close to $100,000.
[00:36:15.936 --> 00:36:25.200]  And 100% of the money bomb money will go to equipment and upgrades here in the office and hiring more people.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.301]  Going back to Lou Rockwell and some of your calls.
[00:36:28.321 --> 00:36:32.823]  Lou Rockwell, what do you see happening, because you're a great political strategist obviously,
[00:36:34.642 --> 00:36:37.025]  In our camp, where do you see Obama going?
[00:36:37.085 --> 00:36:53.045]  Because as the left finds out he lied about secret arrests and rights for detainees, lied about getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan, lied about not hiring lobbyists, lied and said we'll make all the TARP and money and we'll make all the stimulus money public and then he signs orders to make it secret.
[00:36:54.347 --> 00:37:03.659]  I mean, he is, I never thought I would see it, but worse than Bill Clinton, worse than other, you know, slick-lying presidents.
[00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:07.084]  I mean, he has got to be the most bold, deceptive liar.
[00:37:07.124 --> 00:37:08.265]  I know I can't really blame him.
[00:37:08.325 --> 00:37:10.748]  He literally is the teleprompter president.
[00:37:11.249 --> 00:37:15.071]  But the people running him are the most bold liars ever.
[00:37:15.551 --> 00:37:17.112]  What do you see happening down the road?
[00:37:17.132 --> 00:37:28.798]  Because I see a lot of his support beginning to fall, and they try to have the fake right attack him to get the left to support him, just because the fake right's attacking him, kind of in that controlled left-right paradigm where the two prop each other up.
[00:37:29.018 --> 00:37:30.059]  Where do you see that going?
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.581]  Alex, I think he's going to be a one-term president.
[00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:46.170]  I think that as the economy gets worse, as we face hyperinflation, as we face a significantly lower standard of living, really the average American standard of living has been falling since probably the 1970s because of the Federal Reserve.
[00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:47.911]  So we're about to face another huge
[00:37:48.804 --> 00:37:49.905]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:38:07.876 --> 00:38:09.857]  I mean, I'm even starting to miss Bush a little bit.
[00:38:10.197 --> 00:38:10.997]  Exactly!
[00:38:11.237 --> 00:38:18.540]  On the other hand, we all have to remember that this vast apparatus of the regime, the President's like a sticky face on the lapel of a suit.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:28.184]  I mean, they change that smiley face on there when we get to hate the previous one, but this vast apparatus at work, the President is not actually running all of this.
[00:38:28.724 --> 00:38:34.108]  There are many other people involved, both in special interest and in the state itself.
[00:38:34.889 --> 00:38:49.060]  But I think because of what the Federal Reserve has unleashed, with what they've done since last fall, especially, really since 2001 and since 1998 and since 1913 in another sense, that Obama is going to be deeply undermined.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.181]  I think they're going to have to have another candidate.
[00:38:51.542 --> 00:38:55.905]  But, you know, whether it's Obama or it's Bush II or it's Obama II or Hillary or whatever,
[00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:58.971]  It's always going to be a criminal.
[00:38:59.011 --> 00:39:03.053]  Anybody who's allowed to become president is probably going to be a criminal.
[00:39:03.893 --> 00:39:05.714]  But again, they can be resisted.
[00:39:06.014 --> 00:39:11.237]  I would say don't put our faith in what politicians are elected, with the one single exception of Ron Paul.
[00:39:13.727 --> 00:39:19.489]  In a very long time, the only decent politician there is, the only decent public official.
[00:39:19.509 --> 00:39:22.771]  So if we could elect Ron Paul, it's quite a different matter.
[00:39:23.391 --> 00:39:25.512]  Oh boy, I only wish we could have done that in 2008.
[00:39:25.572 --> 00:39:28.993]  So do you think we should focus more on the counties and cities and states?
[00:39:29.013 --> 00:39:31.334]  The media tries to focus on localities, on ourselves.
[00:39:31.374 --> 00:39:32.054]  Those individuals.
[00:39:32.094 --> 00:39:33.695]  Do we know what we need to know?
[00:39:33.715 --> 00:39:35.856]  Have we read books about the Federal Reserve?
[00:39:36.116 --> 00:39:37.857]  Do we know about our liberties?
[00:39:37.917 --> 00:39:41.899]  Have we read about the case for liberty and the dangers of big government?
[00:39:42.199 --> 00:39:44.740]  We have to educate ourselves first and foremost.
[00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:47.141]  Then we can have effects on other people.
[00:39:47.381 --> 00:39:49.222]  But absolutely we need to work locally.
[00:39:50.403 --> 00:39:51.663]  Forget national elections.
[00:39:51.844 --> 00:39:54.165]  I'm sorry to say they have virtually nothing to do with us.
[00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:56.026]  And we can't have any influence.
[00:39:56.326 --> 00:40:01.168]  We can't have influence with the people who like and trust and know us in our own towns and neighborhoods.
[00:40:01.308 --> 00:40:14.932]  Well, I'll tell you, an ace in the hole, and that's why the media is trying to spin it as sedition and rebellion, the states created the federal government, 9th and 10th Amendment, having 30 plus states move and specifically list gun confiscation, big federal government, signing U.N.
[00:40:14.972 --> 00:40:16.153]  treaties, this is all criminal.
[00:40:18.038 --> 00:40:25.328]  To have the states begin to declare their rightful sovereignty, that is another big solution, and that scares them to death.
[00:40:25.668 --> 00:40:35.701]  I've read, not just inside Bilderberg Group connections, but later their think tanks putting out exactly what we hear six months earlier from our sources.
[00:40:36.602 --> 00:40:39.824]  Being put out by their mouthpieces, that they are scared of Ron Paul.
[00:40:40.044 --> 00:40:41.505]  They are scared of the student movements.
[00:40:41.845 --> 00:40:46.608]  Students finding out it's not about liberal or conservative, it's about freedom and shattering the paradigm.
[00:40:46.868 --> 00:40:49.170]  They are scared of states' rights in counties and cities.
[00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:53.813]  They are scared to death of the fact that Americans are buying guns at record rates.
[00:40:53.853 --> 00:40:58.256]  Not that we're going to have a shooting war, but that the people are... Well, look at the polls!
[00:40:58.296 --> 00:41:02.858]  We're becoming a pro-Second Amendment culture again, and even liberals are getting into it.
[00:41:02.878 --> 00:41:03.119]  I mean, I...
[00:41:03.999 --> 00:41:17.027]  There's a lot to be positive about, Lou, as you're saying, but I see that as the reason the establishment is kind of taking the velvet glove off and bringing the iron fist in, in a desperate gamble to try to keep us on the reservation.
[00:41:17.487 --> 00:41:22.870]  I know of a gun shop that has a picture of Obama on the wall and the label underneath says, World's Greatest Gun Salesman.
[00:41:23.811 --> 00:41:24.952]  So just like Clinton,
[00:41:25.689 --> 00:41:31.276]  Was Obama responsible for people arming themselves?
[00:41:31.736 --> 00:41:34.940]  This is, of course, all for the good, but they do fear states' rights.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.228]  It was the evil first Republican President Abe Lincoln who said that the federal government created the states.
[00:41:41.588 --> 00:41:43.769]  Just one of the many lies he told, of course, you say.
[00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:45.509]  The states created the federal government.
[00:41:45.649 --> 00:41:46.950]  What a mistake, by the way!
[00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:50.411]  But, anyway, it's wonderful to see states' rights being discussed again.
[00:41:50.671 --> 00:41:52.812]  It's wonderful to see secession being discussed again.
[00:41:53.092 --> 00:41:59.334]  They thought they had abolished all this by force of arms, with a bullet in their artillery and so forth in 1865.
[00:41:59.414 --> 00:42:00.094]  They didn't.
[00:42:00.134 --> 00:42:08.397]  They didn't end the cause of freedom, the cause of secession, of decentralization, of local freedoms, as versus a highly centralized state.
[00:42:09.091 --> 00:42:14.236]  What should the Pentagon, and we're going to take a few calls and let you go, what should the Pentagon brass be thinking?
[00:42:14.256 --> 00:42:17.499]  I mean, they know there's trillions they've stolen, totally corrupt.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:23.245]  The mid-level officers and the non-commissioned officers, I've talked to them, and they know that treason is going on.
[00:42:23.385 --> 00:42:29.451]  They read the MIAC reports and Homeland Security documents saying veterans are what Homeland Security and NORTHCOM is for.
[00:42:29.911 --> 00:42:32.413]  The veterans are beginning to discover that Homeland Security
[00:42:33.334 --> 00:42:36.157]  is themselves with a gun in their hand with it to their heads.
[00:42:36.698 --> 00:42:40.702]  Just like with Hitler, most of his apparatus was about controlling his own state.
[00:42:41.023 --> 00:42:42.645]  Same thing with Mao or the Soviets.
[00:42:44.086 --> 00:42:46.889]  Ron Paul getting more money than any other candidate from the military.
[00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:53.497]  I think the globalists are really a paper tiger unless they can stage things and trick us into going along with them.
[00:42:53.897 --> 00:42:58.518]  Well, it's actually one of the happy events, I guess, of just human nature.
[00:42:58.979 --> 00:43:02.340]  Within the state, within special interests, they all hate each other's guts.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.020]  So the FBI hates the CIA.
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.822]  The CIA is far more worried about the FBI than any alleged terrorist coming over here.
[00:43:09.262 --> 00:43:11.883]  And that's, you know, they focus on the whole Pentagon.
[00:43:12.223 --> 00:43:13.543]  The Army hates the Navy.
[00:43:13.623 --> 00:43:17.004]  The Air Force hates the, you know, the Coast Guard or whatever.
[00:43:17.304 --> 00:43:18.645]  They all hate each other's guts.
[00:43:18.665 --> 00:43:22.806]  They're all focused on each other, various interest groups, the banks.
[00:43:23.246 --> 00:43:24.989]  Again, the genius of the founding fathers.
[00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:41.591]  The gridlock is good.
[00:43:41.631 --> 00:43:46.554]  You're always saying, we want to end the gridlock of centralized power, but no, that's the opposite of what we want.
[00:43:46.614 --> 00:43:47.975]  Absolutely, Leroy Rockwell.
[00:43:48.575 --> 00:43:56.840]  And that's what the Founding Fathers talked about, was the separation of powers, to have all these powerful interests coming against each other, so they could never combine against the people.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:09.527]  Well, Abraham Lincoln, of course, ended that, when he destroyed the original republic, and set up what we should really think of as the second republic, the second American republic, an entirely new form of government, and a bad one.
[00:44:11.564 --> 00:44:17.625]  Yeah, really, it's a centralized kind of imperium of whoever controls D.C.
[00:44:18.005 --> 00:44:28.908]  Well, Robert E. Lee had a very interesting correspondence with Lord Acton after the war, and Acton wrote him, and he said, I'm just heart sick over the fact that you lost, because I know you were fighting the battle of liberty for all of us.
[00:44:29.588 --> 00:44:38.550]  And Robert E. Lee wrote back, and he said, because we lost, we will now see the federal government become a despotism at home and an empire overseas.
[00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:40.030]  And, of course, that's exactly right.
[00:44:41.383 --> 00:44:44.226]  But those that liked Empire in England then cozied up.
[00:44:44.266 --> 00:44:46.127]  They said, oh, now we can work with you.
[00:44:46.147 --> 00:44:48.129]  Oh, disgusting.
[00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:50.431]  Well, you know, the U.S.
[00:44:50.591 --> 00:44:53.013]  is in fact the greatest empire in the history of the world.
[00:44:53.574 --> 00:44:56.637]  It's got far more colonies, far more dependencies.
[00:44:57.077 --> 00:45:01.341]  We make the Romans, the British, the rest of them just look like dirt under our feet.
[00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:03.010]  We are weak.
[00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.830]  The U.S.
[00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:09.073]  government is the biggest empire ever to exist, but there are problems in that.
[00:45:09.113 --> 00:45:10.514]  There are calculation problems.
[00:45:10.834 --> 00:45:14.356]  There's a reason that, for example, they can't build themselves a good-looking memorial anymore.
[00:45:14.376 --> 00:45:19.919]  If you take a look at the memorials they built themselves for the various wars and other murderous expeditions there in Washington.
[00:45:20.339 --> 00:45:21.801]  The recent ones are all ugly.
[00:45:21.841 --> 00:45:23.463]  The FDR memorial is ugly.
[00:45:23.503 --> 00:45:25.125]  The World War II memorial is ugly.
[00:45:25.525 --> 00:45:27.427]  The Korean War memorial is ugly.
[00:45:28.308 --> 00:45:35.156]  The Vietnam War memorial is quite a striking thing, but that was built outside the government and the whole national media hated it and so forth.
[00:45:35.556 --> 00:45:44.179]  But if you look at the things the federal government is doing, whether it's, you know, whether it's the stuff in New Orleans after the hurricane, everything they do is a disaster.
[00:45:44.559 --> 00:45:49.981]  So the bigger the thing becomes, the less efficient it becomes, the more bureaucratic it becomes.
[00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:54.922]  It's like a great beast stumbling around half-blinded.
[00:45:55.143 --> 00:45:57.163]  If you end up under one of its feet, you're dead.
[00:45:57.443 --> 00:45:59.344]  But it is possible to avoid the feet.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.067]  So it's like Frankenstein.
[00:46:02.107 --> 00:46:03.411]  Well, it is like Frankenstein.
[00:46:03.431 --> 00:46:05.177]  Yeah, only Frankenstein didn't take our money.
[00:46:06.715 --> 00:46:07.175]  Alex, thank you, sir.
[00:46:37.375 --> 00:46:38.676]  There he goes, Lew Rockwell.
[00:46:39.676 --> 00:46:43.338]  I will remind the listeners, we are in the middle, and it is going great.
[00:46:43.358 --> 00:46:56.404]  Looks like we may hit that goal, but it's up to you of $250,000 to expand the studios, buy new equipment, get more webmasters, get more video editors, and double our game here in the face of the globalists.
[00:46:56.424 --> 00:46:58.345]  Hey, if we don't do it, who else will?
[00:46:58.685 --> 00:47:00.005]  So, people said they want to support us.
[00:47:00.286 --> 00:47:01.326]  Step up to the plate, folks.
[00:47:01.906 --> 00:47:03.887]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:47:04.407 --> 00:47:05.108]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:05.128 --> 00:47:05.528]  Stay with us.
[00:47:07.515 --> 00:47:13.720]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:47:14.181 --> 00:47:21.967]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:47:22.307 --> 00:47:27.892]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:47:28.212 --> 00:47:30.173]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:47:30.473 --> 00:47:35.214]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:47:35.554 --> 00:47:40.316]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:47:40.776 --> 00:47:44.637]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:47:45.117 --> 00:47:46.138]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:47:46.218 --> 00:47:50.299]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:47:50.719 --> 00:47:51.039]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.182]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:47:57.282 --> 00:48:02.765]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:48:20.715 --> 00:48:26.938]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:48:27.298 --> 00:48:29.138]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:48:29.279 --> 00:48:31.699]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:42.724]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.620]  It's not about left or right.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.401]  It's about a one world government.
[00:48:46.881 --> 00:48:53.202]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:48:53.782 --> 00:49:01.544]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:49:02.044 --> 00:49:03.185]  The Obama Deception.
[00:49:03.605 --> 00:49:04.805]  The people strike back.
[00:49:06.912 --> 00:49:11.915]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful, and natural antioxidants found in red wine.
[00:49:12.235 --> 00:49:16.257]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[00:49:16.713 --> 00:49:20.835]  Now you don't have to drink even a single drop thanks to NuRev.
[00:49:21.135 --> 00:49:27.098]  NuRev is America's number one anti-aging supplement thanks to its active ingredient resveratrol.
[00:49:27.339 --> 00:49:37.944]  Resveratrol is the main nutrient found in red wine and has been proven to help slow down the aging process, help you lose weight, override an unhealthy lifestyle, boost your energy level, and
[00:49:39.813 --> 00:49:40.133]  I think so.
[00:50:06.454 --> 00:50:08.675]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[00:50:08.815 --> 00:50:17.940]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[00:50:18.321 --> 00:50:24.584]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line.
[00:50:24.804 --> 00:50:26.145]  With American Tax Settlement.

[00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:40.392]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[00:50:40.773 --> 00:50:45.415]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.

[00:50:58.666 --> 00:50:58.986]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[00:50:59.006 --> 00:50:59.227]  Call today!
[00:51:32.421 --> 00:51:34.702]  All right, I know we've had loaded phone lines for a while.
[00:51:35.062 --> 00:51:37.444]  Had to break down all that Glenn Beck treason and the rest of it.
[00:51:37.984 --> 00:51:39.144]  Taking some of your calls right now.
[00:51:39.164 --> 00:51:42.466]  Cindy Sheehan's going to be in studio with us in about 30-40 minutes, then we're going to take more calls.
[00:51:42.906 --> 00:51:45.488]  It is the second annual InfoWars.com Money Bomb.
[00:51:45.948 --> 00:51:48.409]  We're getting right up there at $100,000, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:48.429 --> 00:51:49.510]  This is very, very exciting.
[00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:51.411]  Thank you so much for all the support.
[00:51:51.431 --> 00:51:52.691]  We're going to do a lot of great things with it.
[00:51:53.652 --> 00:51:58.254]  Let's go ahead and talk to Saeed, I believe, in New Jersey.
[00:51:58.334 --> 00:51:59.455]  Thanks for holding, Saeed.
[00:51:59.755 --> 00:52:00.315]  You're on the air.
[00:52:00.335 --> 00:52:01.976]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:52:02.472 --> 00:52:02.732]  Good.
[00:52:04.053 --> 00:52:10.636]  Basically, I was calling, I'm a little behind on your podcast, but I was calling to commend you on your show last Thursday.
[00:52:11.377 --> 00:52:16.459]  Because I'm used to listening to guys that don't really have a good understanding of history.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.600]  So you pretty much broke it down.
[00:52:19.501 --> 00:52:20.942]  And I just wanted to add my two cents.
[00:52:22.202 --> 00:52:27.245]  And basically, I just wanted to cover about the Wahhabis.
[00:52:28.566 --> 00:52:30.807]  Yes, go ahead, that's the... Go ahead.
[00:52:31.601 --> 00:52:33.421]  Basically, I just was going to cover that.
[00:52:33.842 --> 00:52:38.003]  The Wahhabis are actually a splinter cell from the traditional Sunni element.
[00:52:38.983 --> 00:52:39.323]  Oh, sure.
[00:52:39.363 --> 00:52:41.163]  I mean, I'm sorry I didn't make it clear.
[00:52:41.183 --> 00:52:43.304]  I was just giving Americans kind of the basic.
[00:52:43.544 --> 00:52:45.525]  Yeah, that's a subgroup out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:52:46.085 --> 00:52:46.325]  Right.
[00:52:46.505 --> 00:52:54.487]  And basically, this group, there's one document that a lot of people don't realize was published, and it was published by a guy.
[00:52:55.147 --> 00:52:56.487]  I believe his last name was Hempfer.
[00:52:56.707 --> 00:52:57.508]  You can Google that.
[00:52:57.848 --> 00:52:59.328]  And it was actually his document.
[00:52:59.835 --> 00:53:13.666]  And he was a spy around the late 1600s, early 1700s, who had gone into Saudi Arabia, learned Farsi, Turkish, Arabic, and he was looking for someone to basically uprise.
[00:53:13.826 --> 00:53:17.709]  And he had found this guy by the name of Abdul Wahab.
[00:53:18.482 --> 00:53:20.383]  We'll stop there, because I am aware of this.
[00:53:20.423 --> 00:53:22.204]  This is mainline British history.
[00:53:22.804 --> 00:53:33.889]  And for those that don't know, this is how empires would come in and colonize, is they would set up a group to uprise if they wanted to overthrow a government, or work with a government to suppress if they would.
[00:53:34.429 --> 00:53:43.673]  And yes, going back to this tribe, I simplified it with Lawrence of Arabia, the real alliance being made, Saudi Arabia having its lines drawn with Lawrence of Arabia.
[00:53:44.674 --> 00:53:47.795]  But yes, the House of Saud works for the New World Order, but go ahead.
[00:53:48.635 --> 00:54:15.591]  Right, and, um, so this guy basically, you know, he uprose, they found, you know, an element that was against the Turks, and, you know, so this started basically what I'm trying to explain to people around the 1700s, and, you know, in there, before this, there really wasn't, you know, a lot of the media I'm watching claim, you know, oh, Sunnis kill Shias, or Shias kill Sunnis, and even with what's going on right now in Iraq, the Shias realize that this isn't the Sunni element that's doing this, this is the Wahhabi element that's doing this.
[00:54:16.272 --> 00:54:18.113]  And, uh, basically,
[00:54:18.945 --> 00:54:27.208]  What McCain was saying during the election, when he was talking about this troop surge and, you know, the great success that's happened, basically had nothing to do with the troop surge.
[00:54:27.529 --> 00:54:30.390]  It had to do with the Sunni groups trying to oust the Wahhabis.
[00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:32.591]  So... No, absolutely!
[00:54:32.631 --> 00:54:35.072]  I mean, that's really on record, even in mainline news.
[00:54:35.152 --> 00:54:36.092]  It's just buried, yes.
[00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:45.156]  Right, and now, basically what I'm trying to explain is the same thing is going on right now in Pakistan, where now you hear about these tribal militias are coming together and, you know,
[00:54:46.013 --> 00:54:49.254]  Uprising against, you know, this Wahhabi element of the Taliban.
[00:54:49.674 --> 00:54:52.615]  And if you wanted to look this up, there's actually two really good books.
[00:54:52.735 --> 00:54:53.955]  One is by Stephen Schwartz.
[00:54:54.395 --> 00:54:59.297]  It's called The Two Faces of Islam, and it discusses the traditional Sunnis and the Wahhabi split.
[00:54:59.797 --> 00:55:07.599]  And the document I'm talking about, the actual diary of, I believe his first name is Brian, Brian Hempher, it's called Confessions of a British Spy.
[00:55:07.899 --> 00:55:11.100]  And I think you can probably find that on a PDF file if you look that up.
[00:55:12.672 --> 00:55:14.514]  I believe it's later than the 1600s.
[00:55:15.135 --> 00:55:17.037]  It's the 1700s, I believe.
[00:55:17.077 --> 00:55:17.978]  But yeah, no, I've read it.
[00:55:18.879 --> 00:55:23.543]  This is taught in mainline, mainline history of the Middle East courses.
[00:55:26.505 --> 00:55:39.250]  I've separately, years ago, bought a bunch of, on DVD, and before that on audio cassette, history of the Middle East, and I bought some on history of Islam, history of Greece, just basic stuff, and that's all really pretty much admitted.
[00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:48.454]  And see, anytime you try to get a government that tries to build up, I'm not defending Saddam Hussein, but the point is, they used him to get in power, then he actually tried to build Iraq up,
[00:55:48.914 --> 00:55:50.115]  So they took him down.
[00:55:50.135 --> 00:55:51.256]  I'm not saying he was a good guy.
[00:55:51.656 --> 00:55:53.578]  The issue is the Serbs aren't good guys either.
[00:55:53.598 --> 00:55:54.599]  You know, the Serb leadership.
[00:55:54.879 --> 00:55:57.641]  But they're not under New World Order control, so they're taken down.
[00:55:58.662 --> 00:55:59.383]  And so that's what they do.
[00:55:59.423 --> 00:56:04.948]  They play one country off against the next, and as soon as they were done with Iraq, attacking Iran, they took down Iraq.
[00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:06.529]  And it just goes on.
[00:56:06.609 --> 00:56:08.030]  It's so dastardly.
[00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:16.778]  And now they've got these 5,000 Iraqis here that they're going to blame on probably Shiites, because they never blame it on the precious Saudi Arabian Wahhabist.
[00:56:17.458 --> 00:56:19.299]  And then they may try to blame it on the Sunnis.
[00:56:19.319 --> 00:56:20.119]  You're absolutely right.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.761]  It's all about set-ups.
[00:56:22.901 --> 00:56:24.722]  How many Arabs or Muslims understand this?
[00:56:25.542 --> 00:56:30.945]  Well, it's kind of crazy because the mainstream media feeds off the ignorant.
[00:56:30.965 --> 00:56:35.607]  So they try to find these disgruntled Wahhabis and they throw them on the news or whatever.
[00:56:36.067 --> 00:56:42.090]  And basically, the majority of the people that worship at the mosque, they believe in the same liberties that Christians and Jews believe in.
[00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:43.611]  They don't want their rights taken away.
[00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:45.292]  They don't want other people's rights taken away.
[00:56:45.532 --> 00:56:47.033]  The Koran makes it very clear that
[00:56:47.506 --> 00:56:51.811]  You know, you can't spill the blood of innocent people, men, women, children, elderly... No, absolutely.
[00:56:51.831 --> 00:56:56.857]  The globalists promote the radical Islam, just like they promote everything else that'll destabilize.
[00:56:57.839 --> 00:56:58.760]  We're on the march.
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:00.842]  The empire's on the run.
[00:57:01.763 --> 00:57:04.447]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:07.148 --> 00:57:12.709]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:57:13.009 --> 00:57:14.170]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:18.271]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[00:57:18.571 --> 00:57:20.151]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:57:20.431 --> 00:57:26.733]  And now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[00:57:27.893 --> 00:57:30.434]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[00:57:30.755 --> 00:57:32.235]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:57:32.496 --> 00:57:35.277]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:57:35.497 --> 00:57:36.938]  And their formula really works.
[00:57:37.218 --> 00:57:39.759]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.300]  Try the NutriCafe.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:45.903]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[00:57:46.283 --> 00:57:48.464]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:57:48.704 --> 00:57:50.985]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:57:51.166 --> 00:57:52.927]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:57:53.267 --> 00:57:54.848]  Go to www.
[00:57:56.289 --> 00:57:58.592]  We're good to go.
[00:58:07.267 --> 00:58:12.271]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:58:12.471 --> 00:58:16.273]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:16.513 --> 00:58:22.117]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:22.418 --> 00:58:27.261]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:27.481 --> 00:58:27.981]  Number 3.
[00:58:28.381 --> 00:58:33.823]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:58:34.004 --> 00:58:34.224]  Number 4.
[00:58:34.684 --> 00:58:37.325]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:58:37.585 --> 00:58:40.986]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:41.246 --> 00:58:41.766]  Number 5.
[00:58:42.087 --> 00:58:45.688]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:58:45.948 --> 00:58:51.433]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:58:51.674 --> 00:58:56.238]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:56.378 --> 00:58:57.920]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.482]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[00:59:00.723 --> 00:59:03.365]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:59:07.196 --> 00:59:08.738]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:13.525]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:13.605 --> 00:59:16.369]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:16.569 --> 00:59:19.453]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:19.633 --> 00:59:24.360]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:24.941]  We're good.
[00:59:40.182 --> 00:59:40.682]  I think so.
[01:00:26.461 --> 01:00:31.645]  Okay, we got Cindy Sheehan in studio with us right now for the next 45 minutes or so.
[01:00:31.665 --> 01:00:33.206]  I'm going to open the phones up again.
[01:00:33.226 --> 01:00:36.669]  We'll open the phones up while she's here with us, but not in this segment.
[01:00:37.049 --> 01:00:39.851]  Her body is patiently holding on the line.
[01:00:39.871 --> 01:00:40.872]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:40.892 --> 01:00:41.232]  Look, 12 months ago...
[01:00:46.266 --> 01:00:49.367]  We had listeners have the idea for a money bomb.
[01:00:49.387 --> 01:00:50.548]  They saw Ron Paul do it.
[01:00:50.588 --> 01:00:51.688]  They saw Democrats do it.
[01:00:51.728 --> 01:00:52.909]  They saw Republicans do it.
[01:00:53.389 --> 01:00:54.629]  Tens of millions of dollars raised.
[01:00:54.649 --> 01:00:58.371]  They said, Alex, you need to get a bigger studio, get bigger offices, make more films.
[01:00:58.951 --> 01:01:00.151]  You need to do a TV show.
[01:01:00.191 --> 01:01:01.812]  You need to get on direct TV dish.
[01:01:01.872 --> 01:01:03.312]  Well, this is what we did in a year.
[01:01:03.513 --> 01:01:03.953]  It took me
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:09.246]  Three months to find a studio after the money bomb.
[01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:09.926]  That's pretty quick.
[01:01:10.327 --> 01:01:12.390]  You know, find a building.
[01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:13.171]  7,800 square feet.
[01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:16.375]  A couple months to get moved in, to get it renovated.
[01:01:16.395 --> 01:01:17.597]  A couple months to build the studios.
[01:01:17.837 --> 01:01:19.239]  We've been in here about five, six months.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:25.904]  And we built the radio slash TV studios, and I thought I'd build a little studio out there for TV, but it's not really big enough, I've been told.
[01:01:25.924 --> 01:01:26.865]  It's very small out there.
[01:01:26.885 --> 01:01:29.967]  We did a tour in the videos on InfoWars of me explaining that.
[01:01:30.388 --> 01:01:39.374]  And the space right next to us is available, and unfortunately, but also fortunately, because the economy's imploding, it's the same amount of square feet as this, but for about 35-40% of the cost.
[01:01:42.342 --> 01:01:44.806]  7,000 plus square feet for $3,000 a month.
[01:01:45.267 --> 01:01:53.921]  So, we've already got enough from the money bomb to do that, but we're in negotiations with them, and then when they figure out you want it, then they, you know, but we're probably getting the space right next to us.
[01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:56.750]  We may get something else in this complex.
[01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:59.571]  The point is, is already $100,000 has come in.
[01:01:59.611 --> 01:02:00.292]  It's up on the board.
[01:02:00.312 --> 01:02:04.534]  You can watch it changing every few minutes as it goes up at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:02:05.335 --> 01:02:07.035]  But our bandwidth a year costs over $300,000.
[01:02:07.276 --> 01:02:10.837]  And that's very inexpensive bandwidth we're buying from big CDNs.
[01:02:11.278 --> 01:02:12.719]  Same folks Google gets theirs from.
[01:02:13.099 --> 01:02:14.259]  That's how big we've gotten.
[01:02:14.279 --> 01:02:14.900]  $30,000 a month in bandwidth.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.001]  That's about $22,000 in bandwidth and then IT total.
[01:02:17.021 --> 01:02:17.501]  It's about $30,000 a month.
[01:02:23.044 --> 01:02:29.747]  That is a very hard nut to crack, and I don't like getting up here on the air every day and this product, that product, get this, get that, but that's what funds us.
[01:02:29.767 --> 01:02:35.509]  You know, I put my films out for free, and that's why they go so viral, is because I put them out for free and I promote they're free.
[01:02:36.089 --> 01:02:38.790]  Endgame, The Obama Deception, Truth Rising, Terrorist Storm.
[01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:43.752]  These are the number one films online, week in, week out, month in, month out, year in, year out.
[01:02:44.807 --> 01:02:55.213]  Well, we're going to start putting out more and more films, and we're going to get more aggressive and hire a couple more video editors, a couple more webmasters, get a bigger space, do the full TV deal, and, you know, fund that with other funds I have coming in.
[01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:56.894]  $250,000 is very small.
[01:02:57.215 --> 01:02:59.056]  Most real studios, each camera is $50,000.
[01:02:59.096 --> 01:03:01.517]  You only have four cameras, so that's $200,000 right there.
[01:03:01.537 --> 01:03:03.198]  We've got little $4,000, $5,000 cameras, but we're doing it on the cheaps.
[01:03:07.042 --> 01:03:13.685]  The issue is we need $250,000 minimum to be able to really go to the next level, and hopefully folks are going to do that.
[01:03:13.705 --> 01:03:15.285]  It looks like you are stepping up to the plate.
[01:03:16.146 --> 01:03:16.666]  But the P.O.
[01:03:16.706 --> 01:03:17.606]  Box is up there.
[01:03:17.946 --> 01:03:19.267]  You can still mail stuff to us.
[01:03:19.287 --> 01:03:22.368]  You can call the toll-free number to donate today.
[01:03:22.748 --> 01:03:24.249]  This is running through from 11 a.m.
[01:03:24.289 --> 01:03:25.309]  today to 11 a.m.
[01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:30.611]  tomorrow, and almost $100,000 has come in in just the last few hours.
[01:03:31.032 --> 01:03:32.092]  Very, very exciting.
[01:03:32.112 --> 01:03:32.972]  So God bless you.
[01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:33.933]  I thank you.
[01:03:34.833 --> 01:03:47.026]  We're not the government that takes your money and then gives it to bomb makers and pays three times what a cruise missile's worth to GE that owns NBC and then NBC puts out pro-war propaganda.
[01:03:47.526 --> 01:03:48.587]  That's government paid for.
[01:03:48.988 --> 01:03:52.511]  Or the open government money that is paid
[01:03:54.313 --> 01:03:54.774]  We're good to go.
[01:04:10.317 --> 01:04:15.804]  Nobody like Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and the films and books and all the things we do and all the things we've expanded here.
[01:04:15.844 --> 01:04:25.597]  So I want to thank all of you that have supported us, the PrisonPlanet.tv members, folks that have bought the books and videos, people that support the sponsors, and people that give on the once a year money bomb.
[01:04:25.617 --> 01:04:26.659]  This is our second annual.
[01:04:27.199 --> 01:04:36.584]  I want to thank listeners like Eric Nordstrom who had the idea to do this a year ago because in the past I would shrink from asking for money and I kind of liked staying small and didn't like the responsibility.
[01:04:37.004 --> 01:04:48.730]  Now I've decided just to go all the way, grow as fast as I can, do as much as I can, reach as many people as I can and pump all the profits right back into expanding our fight against the globalists and the New World Order because my children have no future.
[01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:50.251]  And your children have no future.
[01:04:50.311 --> 01:04:51.953]  None of us have any future if we don't turn this around.
[01:04:51.993 --> 01:04:56.697]  So, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:04:56.757 --> 01:05:00.441]  Link through and give in the June 11, 2009 Money Bomb.
[01:05:00.721 --> 01:05:01.582]  It is going right now.
[01:05:01.822 --> 01:05:05.866]  I'm going to do an hour of overdrive today to take calls just on the Money Bomb from listeners.
[01:05:05.886 --> 01:05:08.248]  So, we'll be going live until 4 o'clock Central Standard Time today.
[01:05:08.268 --> 01:05:14.234]  And I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, sitting in the command chair with Jason Bermas, 9 to midnight tonight.
[01:05:14.474 --> 01:05:14.894]  We're good to go.
[01:05:37.874 --> 01:05:43.478]  And you were really that focal point that really made the war unpopular.
[01:05:44.239 --> 01:05:48.042]  If people can touch one zeitgeist or one pillar, one point,
[01:05:50.626 --> 01:05:58.628]  You know, one Rosetta Stone that really exposed this war, it's Cindy Sheehan and her great supporters in your story.
[01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:13.112]  The other problem and sad problem is, if anybody can touch a zeitgeist or a keystone and say, what has allowed it to continue and actually expand and really destroyed a lot of your work, is Barack Obama.
[01:06:13.712 --> 01:06:16.413]  And I want to get your take on that statement I just made, but it's great to have you here with us.
[01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:20.341]  Oh Alex, it's nice to be finally in studio with you.
[01:06:20.762 --> 01:06:21.502]  It is good.
[01:06:21.523 --> 01:06:28.310]  I feel like I've met you many times on the road and at Crawford and Denver and California and places, but to be here now in studio with you is so great.
[01:06:28.571 --> 01:06:34.558]  You've got the floor, but I'd like you to speak about the statement I just made about the parties, the betrayal, the false hope, where this country's going.
[01:06:34.895 --> 01:06:40.998]  Well, of course, you know, I think you're perfectly correct when you say that.
[01:06:41.458 --> 01:06:49.222]  I think in the summer of 2005, many people recognized that that was going to be, you know, the point that
[01:06:52.761 --> 01:06:54.262]  You know, what am I trying to say?
[01:06:54.322 --> 01:06:59.285]  The popularity of the war, of George Bush, was going to turn.
[01:06:59.605 --> 01:07:00.445]  It was going to turn there.
[01:07:00.465 --> 01:07:01.386]  The tipping point.
[01:07:01.466 --> 01:07:02.727]  Right, the tipping point, right.
[01:07:02.927 --> 01:07:07.469]  And so, many organizations came out to try and co-opt that movement.
[01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:08.890]  And they did co-opt the movement.
[01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:18.215]  MoveOn.org is one of the biggest organizations, is the biggest organization that came out and co-opted it and used it to just elect Democrats.
[01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:20.796]  And now we see we have a...
[01:07:48.855 --> 01:07:49.516]  Well, they did.
[01:07:49.576 --> 01:07:55.859]  Move On did give me a chance to sell out my position on Troops Home immediately and completely.
[01:07:55.879 --> 01:08:01.503]  And it was in my trailer in Crawford, Texas, one of the last days of Camp Casey.
[01:08:01.923 --> 01:08:05.045]  And of course, I refused them, and so they cut all ties with me.
[01:08:05.065 --> 01:08:06.566]  Describe that story for those that don't know.
[01:08:06.586 --> 01:08:06.966]  This is key.
[01:08:07.486 --> 01:08:07.766]  Right.
[01:08:07.786 --> 01:08:08.467]  This is history.
[01:08:08.687 --> 01:08:10.649]  Yeah, well... I mean, the war is collapsing.
[01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:12.371]  80% are against it.
[01:08:12.431 --> 01:08:13.252]  It's totally a fraud.
[01:08:13.292 --> 01:08:13.973]  Millions dead.
[01:08:13.993 --> 01:08:17.776]  And, you know, Bush has tried to demonize you.
[01:08:17.796 --> 01:08:18.657]  The neocons had it.
[01:08:18.737 --> 01:08:19.378]  It failed.
[01:08:20.259 --> 01:08:21.460]  And then here come the Judas Goats.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.241]  Tell people that story.
[01:08:22.421 --> 01:08:27.226]  Well then, you know, they sent out their big guns from Washington, D.C.
[01:08:27.667 --> 01:08:34.655]  to try and convince me to support, you know, a troops home eventually bill that the Democrats were trying to push through.
[01:08:34.775 --> 01:08:42.263]  And me and the very dedicated people, we refused to support that and we wanted to keep our
[01:08:44.485 --> 01:08:47.626]  You know, our position of troops out completely.
[01:08:47.966 --> 01:08:53.107]  And now we know that the Democrats were only co-opting Camp Casey to get back in power.
[01:08:53.147 --> 01:08:55.607]  They had no intention of ending the war.
[01:08:55.627 --> 01:08:57.288]  Just look what's happening right now.
[01:08:57.688 --> 01:09:09.050]  Nancy Pelosi is literally browbeating her caucus to vote for the war funding, because every Republican is going to vote against it, and so she needs every Democratic vote.
[01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:09.490]  I don't know.
[01:09:31.116 --> 01:09:34.097]  Ran against Nancy Pelosi in her district as an independent.
[01:09:34.897 --> 01:09:39.818]  And the system is definitely stacked against us and our voices for sure.
[01:09:40.459 --> 01:09:42.039]  Now that was a rig deal.
[01:09:42.079 --> 01:09:42.539]  No kidding.
[01:09:42.939 --> 01:09:51.362]  So I'm more into, you know, like you were talking about before, you just mentioned something that there's really no left or right.
[01:09:51.382 --> 01:09:53.482]  There's no liberal or conservative.
[01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:57.383]  Those things, those labels don't make sense anymore at all.
[01:09:57.863 --> 01:09:59.004]  If Obama's left,
[01:09:59.784 --> 01:10:00.405]  Then what am I?
[01:10:00.425 --> 01:10:02.926]  If Hillary's left, then what am I?
[01:10:02.946 --> 01:10:08.631]  You know, if you're far right, then what is Bill O'Reilly?
[01:10:09.011 --> 01:10:11.973]  You know, these labels just don't make sense to us anymore.
[01:10:12.433 --> 01:10:19.579]  So, Alex, I want to ask you a question, because I do have my own radio show now, also, so a lot of times I get to ask questions.
[01:10:19.599 --> 01:10:20.319]  Oh, good, yeah.
[01:10:20.519 --> 01:10:21.240]  I like being interviewed.
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.701]  I actually do better when I get interviewed, yeah.
[01:10:22.921 --> 01:10:27.807]  Well, I'm going to be on the air in Dallas on Sundays at 3 now, so I'm very excited about that.
[01:10:27.908 --> 01:10:28.288]  Oh, good.
[01:10:28.428 --> 01:10:29.329]  On Rational Radio.
[01:10:29.349 --> 01:10:30.631]  Yeah, they need to hear this voice.
[01:10:31.012 --> 01:10:31.632]  What do you call yourself?
[01:10:31.873 --> 01:10:33.054]  Politically, economically, socially?
[01:10:33.074 --> 01:10:33.335]  Anti-slavery.
[01:10:39.122 --> 01:10:41.405]  I don't want to be under corporate slavery, government slavery.
[01:10:41.525 --> 01:10:47.492]  I understand anything big that's undemocratic and un-libertarian is going to be hijacked by special interests.
[01:10:48.032 --> 01:10:49.354]  And so I'm pro-education.
[01:10:49.374 --> 01:10:51.236]  I want people to know how the world really works.
[01:10:51.897 --> 01:10:54.039]  And I want the ten amendments.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:54.700]  I want them all.
[01:10:55.461 --> 01:10:58.224]  And I know that there may have been differences in the parties before.
[01:10:59.806 --> 01:11:02.369]  And there were sometimes in history, but now there certainly isn't.
[01:11:02.909 --> 01:11:19.443]  And special interests, I mean, we've had Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate come out and say that foreign banks, offshore banks, they're not even foreign, they're offshore, they have no country, pirates, pirates are on the sea, they're not in any nation, that they own and run Congress completely.
[01:11:19.523 --> 01:11:22.585]  Well, one of our senators just said that a couple weeks ago, right?
[01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:24.967]  It was Carl Levin, was it Carl Levin?
[01:11:25.167 --> 01:11:25.588]  He said it.
[01:11:25.608 --> 01:11:27.669]  He said bankers still own Congress.
[01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:31.460]  That's what he said, and he told the truth.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.261]  But now I have another question for you.
[01:11:33.721 --> 01:11:36.322]  You don't ever advocate any violence, do you?
[01:11:36.602 --> 01:11:36.742]  No.
[01:11:36.762 --> 01:11:39.024]  I've never heard you advocate any violence.
[01:11:39.124 --> 01:11:41.365]  I wouldn't be on your show.
[01:11:41.385 --> 01:11:42.666]  What, people say I do?
[01:11:42.826 --> 01:11:44.907]  Yeah, you know, I've heard that.
[01:11:47.248 --> 01:11:53.853]  I think, because you said you support all the amendments from one to ten, and this is the problem in our country.
[01:11:53.873 --> 01:12:00.697]  We think that we can pick and choose what amendments that we like, and then we don't have to like the other ones.
[01:12:00.717 --> 01:12:01.898]  I don't like guns.
[01:12:02.538 --> 01:12:03.159]  I hate guns.
[01:12:03.219 --> 01:12:10.944]  I don't own guns, but the second amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms, doesn't it?
[01:12:11.184 --> 01:12:11.524]  Yes.
[01:12:11.925 --> 01:12:16.448]  And, you know, all the amendments have laws that have passed to restrict
[01:12:17.068 --> 01:12:20.069]  The amendments, and as long as they're not too draconian.
[01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:30.630]  But the thing is, is that we are trying to support this Constitution that our leaders and the banks and the corporations have destroyed.
[01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:40.352]  Well that's what they do, they sell one person, one group, I'm getting rid of this one, and then let's get rid of that one, or let's restrict this one, let's restrict that one, and pretty soon they're all gone.
[01:12:40.952 --> 01:12:44.133]  But no, that's what they do, and that's the new media tactic.
[01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:46.070]  is that
[01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.630]  I think?
[01:13:33.635 --> 01:13:38.238]  Let's talk about this media, left and right, that supported the murder of over a million Iraqis.
[01:13:38.298 --> 01:13:45.563]  See, they always want to get it off of them and onto us, when clearly there's torture going on.
[01:13:45.704 --> 01:13:48.566]  Clearly Obama said he wouldn't hire any lobbyists, and that's all he did.
[01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:54.630]  Clearly he said he was going to make all the bailout money and the stimulus money public, and he's made it a secret.
[01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:59.834]  So clearly this guy is on the telephone, they admit, every week with Bush still.
[01:14:00.274 --> 01:14:05.156]  I mean, you saw him hugging and kissing, literally, when he got on the helicopter, and I'll call you next week.
[01:14:05.176 --> 01:14:06.016]  I was reading their lips.
[01:14:06.036 --> 01:14:07.236]  I mean, you could see it.
[01:14:07.637 --> 01:14:11.418]  And this is a big, sick joke in keeping all of Bush's people and Clinton's people coming in.
[01:14:11.738 --> 01:14:13.259]  I mean, talk about false hope.
[01:14:13.279 --> 01:14:18.240]  You know, that's like kidnapping a little kid with the hope he's going to get some candy when he gets in the van.
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:20.081]  And then now the little kid's kidnapped.
[01:14:20.161 --> 01:14:21.401]  It hasn't dawned on him yet.
[01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:22.882]  He's in the car with a monster.
[01:14:23.502 --> 01:14:26.243]  And so you've got a lot of Democrats now saying, what's wrong with torture?
[01:14:26.263 --> 01:14:27.444]  What's wrong with secret arrest?
[01:14:27.704 --> 01:14:29.544]  What's wrong with keeping the war going?
[01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.565]  And so of course they've got to say we're immoral or we're violent.
[01:14:32.685 --> 01:14:35.386]  And that's what's wrong with the so-called anti-war movement.
[01:14:35.727 --> 01:14:38.368]  They're only an anti-Republican war movement.
[01:14:38.748 --> 01:14:43.790]  And Obama has put half of the country to sleep thinking that if he's doing it, it's okay.
[01:14:45.851 --> 01:14:47.212]  Sonny, let's talk about Obama.
[01:14:47.252 --> 01:14:48.273]  I mean, I'd like to hear in your own words.
[01:14:48.293 --> 01:14:51.756]  I've heard you talk about the two parties being twins and challenging Democrats.
[01:14:51.816 --> 01:14:54.018]  A lot of them are getting this illusion as approval ratings drop.
[01:14:54.579 --> 01:14:55.880]  But the Democrats said, well, what are we going to do?
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:56.741]  Put a Republican in?
[01:14:57.321 --> 01:15:01.405]  No, what we do is make it about issues and say we're not voting for anybody that supports the war.
[01:15:02.266 --> 01:15:06.650]  And we're going to try to impeach anybody that doesn't sign a pledge that when you get elected, you're going to vote against it.
[01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:14.753]  Uh, and it's like that on all these issues where the people are all over here, and whatever the people want happens to be also in the Bill of Rights Constitution on most issues.
[01:15:15.033 --> 01:15:17.014]  And then over here, the government's always doing the opposite.
[01:15:17.074 --> 01:15:19.115]  So, I mean, call him out here on air.
[01:15:19.135 --> 01:15:23.317]  I mean, looking at the camera out there, what does Cindy Sheehan say to these Democrats?
[01:15:23.617 --> 01:15:27.858]  Because I've been on the streets talking to them, and they say, first it was, oh, he's God, he's gonna fix it all.
[01:15:28.159 --> 01:15:31.460]  Now it's, yeah, I know he had to lie to get in, but at least he's not Bush.
[01:15:32.869 --> 01:15:33.710]  Well, you know what?
[01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:34.391]  But that's true.
[01:15:34.431 --> 01:15:35.132]  He's not Bush.
[01:15:35.833 --> 01:15:36.294]  Who is?
[01:15:36.434 --> 01:15:37.135]  Bush is Bush.
[01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:40.119]  But he's continuing the policies of Bush.
[01:15:40.639 --> 01:15:48.189]  I have people on the so-called right email me and say, you're a hypocrite because you oppose Bush's wars but you don't oppose Obama's wars.
[01:15:48.209 --> 01:15:49.171]  They're doing the same thing.
[01:15:49.611 --> 01:15:56.678]  And I say, first of all, I do oppose Obama's wars, but you're the hypocrite if you don't support Obama's wars, because you supported Bush wars.
[01:15:57.018 --> 01:16:00.642]  But now on the Democratic left, it's the same thing.
[01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:06.247]  If you oppose Bush's policies and you support Obama's, that's hypocritical.
[01:16:06.568 --> 01:16:10.111]  And that's what allows our leaders to literally get away with murder.
[01:16:10.231 --> 01:16:11.552]  Murder and torture.
[01:16:12.253 --> 01:16:14.575]  They play us off in this left-right paradigm.
[01:16:14.715 --> 01:16:17.697]  It's like tag team wrestling, but they're both owned by the same company.
[01:16:17.818 --> 01:16:18.498]  It's a game.
[01:16:18.818 --> 01:16:27.485]  You know, and then the Democrats were really upset with Obama when he voted for the FISA legislation, but they won't go so far to say, I'm going to withhold my vote from you.
[01:16:27.786 --> 01:16:29.127]  You didn't earn my vote.
[01:16:29.547 --> 01:16:33.030]  I'm going to vote for somebody who stands up for the Constitution.
[01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:39.333]  Somebody who stands up for our rights, like Cynthia McKinney or Ralph Nader, that would be the Democrats' choice, right?
[01:16:39.373 --> 01:16:43.135]  The Republicans would have had the choice of Ron Paul.
[01:16:43.155 --> 01:16:49.558]  And so they don't, but they don't do that because they believe in this Democrat-Republican paradigm.
[01:16:49.898 --> 01:16:53.800]  So the Democrats just very arrogantly say, who are you going to vote for?
[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:55.261]  Are you going to vote for McCain?
[01:16:56.081 --> 01:16:57.862]  You know, like that's the only two choices.
[01:16:58.262 --> 01:17:01.083]  That our only two choices were McCain or Obama.
[01:17:01.943 --> 01:17:05.184]  And in reality, those are the only two choices.
[01:17:05.224 --> 01:17:07.425]  Those are the only two people that are going to win.
[01:17:07.985 --> 01:17:10.766]  And they're really on the same team working against the people.
[01:17:10.786 --> 01:17:12.446]  In fact, I see this constantly.
[01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:13.326]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:13.386 --> 01:17:14.867]  In hundreds of emails and calls.
[01:17:14.927 --> 01:17:17.107]  I look at, say, the Obama deception on YouTube.
[01:17:17.428 --> 01:17:19.648]  There's a version with two and a half million views.
[01:17:19.928 --> 01:17:21.749]  And I'll check it once they just see what the comments are.
[01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:25.190]  And usually it's, you're just a racist that doesn't like black people.
[01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:25.810]  Oh yeah.
[01:17:25.871 --> 01:17:28.073]  And then you click on their channel, it's always a white guy saying it.
[01:17:28.393 --> 01:17:29.634]  And it gets worse.
[01:17:29.794 --> 01:17:31.116]  It's kind of a high and mighty thing.
[01:17:32.177 --> 01:17:33.178]  But then it's worse.
[01:17:33.218 --> 01:17:37.162]  They say, oh you didn't bash Bush when he was doing all this.
[01:17:37.302 --> 01:17:40.625]  And they don't even know that all I did was go after Bush.
[01:17:40.725 --> 01:17:46.108]  That's not true, because we're going after the policies and the principles, not the person, right?
[01:17:46.588 --> 01:17:59.174]  So now, when we went to George Bush's home in Preston Hollow in Dallas on Monday to protest him, I got as much crap from the left, the so-called left, as I did from the right, because... They want to... Stay there.
[01:17:59.194 --> 01:18:00.174]  They want... Let me guess.
[01:18:00.194 --> 01:18:01.275]  They want it all to end.
[01:18:01.315 --> 01:18:01.535]  They do.
[01:18:01.555 --> 01:18:06.137]  They want to shut up about the war, move on, feel good about themselves, while the Iraqis die.
[01:18:06.177 --> 01:18:06.958]  Stay with us.
[01:18:07.685 --> 01:18:12.637]  The word catastrophe is defined as a sudden and widespread disaster.
[01:18:12.918 --> 01:18:16.126]  The only way to be truly ready is to prepare yourself now.
[01:18:19.312 --> 01:18:19.912]  We're good to go.
[01:18:46.049 --> 01:18:46.770]  We're good to go.
[01:19:07.648 --> 01:19:08.989]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:14.135]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[01:19:14.535 --> 01:19:16.617]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[01:19:16.958 --> 01:19:26.067]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[01:19:26.067 --> 01:19:26.987]  We're good to go.
[01:19:56.032 --> 01:19:56.252]  We're good.
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:09.840]  Spring is here.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:10.860]  Growing season.
[01:20:11.041 --> 01:20:13.021]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:14.641]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:20:14.941 --> 01:20:15.602]  Think about it.
[01:20:15.922 --> 01:20:19.763]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:20:20.003 --> 01:20:23.483]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:20:23.704 --> 01:20:26.264]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:20:26.524 --> 01:20:38.387]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:20:38.627 --> 01:20:38.987]  I think so.
[01:21:17.076 --> 01:21:17.436]  Yeah.
[01:21:24.793 --> 01:21:25.774]  You're on a book tour.
[01:21:25.894 --> 01:21:27.615]  You started a new radio show.
[01:21:27.635 --> 01:21:28.436]  Tell us about that.
[01:21:28.496 --> 01:21:29.917]  Calls are coming up in the next half hour.
[01:21:29.937 --> 01:21:36.361]  But first off, you went to our beloved president, George W. Bush, because that's what the Obama people say now.
[01:21:36.401 --> 01:21:37.102]  You love Bush.
[01:21:37.442 --> 01:21:38.503]  Sidney Sheehan loves Bush.
[01:21:38.583 --> 01:21:39.644]  Alex Jones loves Bush.
[01:21:39.864 --> 01:21:41.565]  When you criticize Obama, you're a right-winger.
[01:21:41.825 --> 01:21:53.273]  So as a right-wing extremist, even though you say you're against the left and right paradigm, but for Move On and George Soros, you went to protest your dear leader, George W. Bush.
[01:21:53.293 --> 01:21:54.274]  Tell us about that in Dallas.
[01:21:54.614 --> 01:21:57.315]  Well, of course, we just want accountability.
[01:21:57.395 --> 01:22:01.476]  We want the Obama administration to appoint a special prosecutor.
[01:22:02.076 --> 01:22:04.577]  But the people on the left are screaming because they do.
[01:22:04.617 --> 01:22:06.598]  They just say, let's move forward.
[01:22:06.658 --> 01:22:08.599]  Let's forget about the last eight years.
[01:22:09.239 --> 01:22:10.499]  But we can't move forward.
[01:22:10.539 --> 01:22:11.299]  We can't heal.
[01:22:11.379 --> 01:22:15.541]  We can't be anywhere near healthy if we don't hold these people accountable.
[01:22:16.261 --> 01:22:25.968]  But the thing the left, the so-called left, wants to stop my voice about is that Obama is doing the exact same thing.
[01:22:26.389 --> 01:22:36.896]  So if it was wrong under Bush and if there were war crimes and crimes against the Constitution under George Bush, then there are war crimes and crimes against the Constitution under Barack Obama.
[01:22:38.077 --> 01:22:39.779]  And then the right has always been against me.
[01:22:40.559 --> 01:22:44.422]  So, you know, they have the same criticisms of being anti-American.
[01:22:44.742 --> 01:22:53.027]  They claim to be so patriotic, hold their flags and wear their little lapel pins, but they want to deny me my First Amendment right.
[01:22:53.936 --> 01:22:55.217]  Well, look at the Democrats.
[01:22:55.297 --> 01:22:59.961]  They are just as warmongering because they're bought and paid for by the same military-industrial-banking complex.
[01:23:00.481 --> 01:23:01.962]  I mean, look at Clinton in Serbia.
[01:23:02.422 --> 01:23:05.265]  Look at LBJ in Vietnam.
[01:23:05.825 --> 01:23:06.746]  I mean, go back.
[01:23:08.027 --> 01:23:08.907]  It's really a fraud.
[01:23:08.927 --> 01:23:13.130]  They want to feel like they're good, feel like they're liberal, feel like they're anti-war.
[01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:17.833]  But in a way, that's even worse, because then people don't mount a resistance.
[01:23:18.073 --> 01:23:26.498]  When it's Bush arrogantly walking around with a chainsaw and a cowboy hat, acting tough, scared of cows and horses, it's obviously outrageous and disgusting.
[01:23:26.778 --> 01:23:30.700]  But when it's Obama reading off a teleprompter in slick, and he's got a...
[01:23:32.734 --> 01:23:34.175]  He's bounding around.
[01:23:34.235 --> 01:23:45.458]  He can read a pretty speech, but he's obviously going this way and this way and reading and he knows how to deliver a speech that somebody wrote for him, but all they are is pretty words.
[01:23:46.079 --> 01:23:49.820]  You know, his actions are speaking way louder than his words.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.901]  We're killing more people in Pakistan, displacing people in Pakistan.
[01:23:55.262 --> 01:23:56.742]  Afghanistan is increasing.
[01:23:56.802 --> 01:23:58.363]  May was the deadliest month for Iraq.
[01:23:59.683 --> 01:24:22.073]  For our soldiers and for the Iraqi people in in months and You know his other policies of continuing military commissions and You know the FISA Modernization Act everything is pointing towards just a complete, you know fascistic takeover of our by our government Yeah, how about that already happened?
[01:24:23.283 --> 01:24:37.827]  Startover is uninterrupted, but absolutely, you know, they go from, we're not spying on you without warrants, to, oh, it's only for Al Qaeda, to, yeah, we're listening and reading everything, and federal courts and Congress say they can do it, and now they're going to put body scanners on the streets of America.
[01:24:38.347 --> 01:24:42.328]  Literally, living in America is going to be like living in an airport, they admit.
[01:24:42.348 --> 01:24:42.908]  Right.
[01:24:42.948 --> 01:24:44.629]  I mean, this is a hellish system.
[01:24:45.009 --> 01:24:45.289]  It is.
[01:24:45.309 --> 01:24:48.771]  I can't even stand to go to the airport and I fly a lot.
[01:24:48.851 --> 01:24:53.214]  It's so oppressive.
[01:24:53.274 --> 01:25:02.019]  It's police state oppression and people just blindly follow it like sheeple going, it's keeping us safe, it's keeping us safe, it's keeping us safe.
[01:25:02.339 --> 01:25:04.940]  But it's keeping us safe at what expense?
[01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:07.642]  At expense to our liberties.
[01:25:07.662 --> 01:25:10.784]  Plus we know there's a history of some of this terror being staged.
[01:25:11.491 --> 01:25:11.751]  Right.
[01:25:11.851 --> 01:25:14.094]  Well, you know, and it's a long history.
[01:25:14.454 --> 01:25:15.976]  It didn't just start on 9-11.
[01:25:16.436 --> 01:25:24.404]  You know, it's a long history in our government of exploiting or causing tragedies or lying about tragedies, like the Gulf of Tonkin, you know.
[01:25:24.425 --> 01:25:26.367]  The government doesn't lie, Cindy.
[01:25:27.448 --> 01:25:28.549]  That, you know what?
[01:25:28.569 --> 01:25:28.929]  What?
[01:25:28.969 --> 01:25:30.491]  That's about all the government does.
[01:25:30.691 --> 01:25:32.432]  I've never heard something that preposterous.
[01:25:32.492 --> 01:25:33.372]  They live.
[01:25:33.492 --> 01:25:35.553]  We're going to come back in 70 seconds, Cindy.

[01:27:19.199 --> 01:27:21.322]  Cindy Duchesne is in studio with us.
[01:27:21.342 --> 01:27:29.052]  Before we forget, and time runs out in the next 30 minutes and we're taking calls, Cindy, tell folks about your book tour, your website, what you're doing.
[01:27:30.153 --> 01:27:33.458]  I wrote an internet booklet called Myth America, 10 Greatest Myths.
[01:27:33.978 --> 01:27:46.670]  It's about removing ourselves from the systems, the robber class systems of the military, the banking and the government to create our own healthy systems.
[01:27:47.071 --> 01:27:50.194]  And I exploit ten myths in my book.
[01:27:50.614 --> 01:27:53.196]  I expose ten myths in my book and I try to
[01:27:54.998 --> 01:27:59.561]  You know, try to convince people that they are dismissed.
[01:27:59.581 --> 01:28:03.984]  For example, that America is the greatest nation in the universe.
[01:28:04.544 --> 01:28:06.726]  For example, elections matter.
[01:28:06.806 --> 01:28:09.568]  The Federal Reserve System cares about us.
[01:28:10.088 --> 01:28:12.530]  That it's noble to die in robber class wars.
[01:28:14.591 --> 01:28:18.113]  That 9-11 was caused by 19 Muslims with box cutters.
[01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:29.680]  So you expose these myths and then you try to overcome them so people can stop trusting and believing everything that the system tells us.
[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.962]  The system is inherently wrong.
[01:28:33.382 --> 01:28:36.464]  And I don't know if we can reform this system.
[01:28:36.484 --> 01:28:38.945]  I don't think the system can be reformed.
[01:28:39.025 --> 01:28:43.448]  I think we need an entire new system that is independent from the robber class.
[01:28:44.268 --> 01:28:48.491]  And I say that we are operating on a class divide in this country.
[01:28:48.891 --> 01:28:50.632]  It's robber class and robbed class.
[01:28:51.032 --> 01:28:54.454]  And there is no distinction between Democrat and Republican.
[01:28:54.474 --> 01:28:56.975]  There is no distinctions in the robber class.
[01:28:57.315 --> 01:29:03.479]  They only work together to steal our wealth, steal our children, and oppress us.
[01:29:04.139 --> 01:29:12.266]  And here in the robbed class, we're all fighting about Democrat, Republican, Black, White, Jew, Christian, Muslim.
[01:29:12.566 --> 01:29:17.070]  We're all divided and we're fighting each other while they're stealing everything we own.
[01:29:17.410 --> 01:29:26.258]  You know, I've read a lot of old declassified French and British intelligence communiques and higher level battle plans that's just now been declassified the last 50 years from 200, 300 years ago.
[01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:27.879]  Right.
[01:29:27.899 --> 01:29:28.039]  Right.
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:28.600]  Right.
[01:29:48.895 --> 01:29:53.318]  And can only get jobs backing up this parasitic corrupt system.
[01:29:53.358 --> 01:30:05.465]  And now they're fully converting what was left of what was our free society into where all the major college grads and the grants and the tuition, the scholarships are for homeland security and spying.
[01:30:05.766 --> 01:30:06.866]  And so you won't have a choice.
[01:30:06.886 --> 01:30:12.610]  They're making a whole world where the whole country in the world is a giant prison and they call it that.
[01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:14.471]  Hence, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:30:15.151 --> 01:30:19.654]  And then the technocrats, those families, they own the very grids that control everybody.
[01:30:20.074 --> 01:30:23.355]  And they're shutting down the farms and ranches with animal ID, premises ID.
[01:30:23.796 --> 01:30:26.037]  I mean, it is hellish how fast they're racing.
[01:30:26.277 --> 01:30:28.058]  They call it the scientific dictatorship.
[01:30:28.078 --> 01:30:29.979]  They say, other dictatorships got overthrown.
[01:30:30.019 --> 01:30:41.805]  This is going to be scientifically done to head the portable humans off at every pass, cornering our own species, institutionalizing predator activity in a scientific mode against the people.
[01:30:42.085 --> 01:30:48.610]  Well, and that's the whole premise of my book, is that not to challenge the system in a full frontal attack.
[01:30:48.991 --> 01:31:08.286]  It's to very subversively undermine the system by removing ourselves from it, to create voluntary cooperatives where we share and grow food together, share resources together, remove ourselves from the banking system, remove ourselves from the credit system, remove ourselves from the military-industrial complex.
[01:31:08.326 --> 01:31:09.107]  And we've got to do it quick!
[01:31:09.707 --> 01:31:11.468]  That's why I published it online.
[01:31:11.748 --> 01:31:13.248]  That's why I didn't go through a publisher.
[01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:16.489]  So it can get into as many people's hands as possible.
[01:31:16.949 --> 01:31:22.311]  And to create communities in cooperation with each other to remove ourselves from their systems.
[01:31:22.371 --> 01:31:23.191]  And it won't matter.
[01:31:23.351 --> 01:31:24.412]  And they will be assaulted.
[01:31:24.432 --> 01:31:26.933]  The outside enemy will find excuses to get in.
[01:31:26.953 --> 01:31:34.855]  That's why they assault anything that tries to, you know, humans get their backs together and try to defend themselves like cows do when wolves come.
[01:31:34.915 --> 01:31:35.915]  Cows will get in a circle.
[01:31:35.935 --> 01:31:36.256]  Right.
[01:31:36.456 --> 01:31:37.736]  And try to protect the calves.
[01:31:37.756 --> 01:31:42.998]  That's why they're trying to keep us divided, so we can't get together and figure out what they're doing to us.
[01:31:43.678 --> 01:31:45.559]  And like you said, it's divide and conquer.
[01:31:45.899 --> 01:31:48.961]  It's what we've been doing throughout history and occupations.
[01:31:49.061 --> 01:31:52.682]  It's what we're currently doing in Iraq and Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[01:31:53.002 --> 01:31:57.684]  Do you think Pakistan is an existential threat to the United States?
[01:31:57.804 --> 01:31:57.964]  No.
[01:31:58.024 --> 01:32:01.446]  What they're doing is further destabilizing that government.
[01:32:01.466 --> 01:32:01.906]  I agree.
[01:32:01.946 --> 01:32:02.306]  Stay there.
[01:32:02.326 --> 01:32:06.428]  Globalist controlled forces on record are there trying to destabilize Pakistan.
[01:32:07.288 --> 01:32:15.937]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:32:16.358 --> 01:32:21.063]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:32:21.523 --> 01:32:24.086]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals.
[01:32:24.506 --> 01:32:26.127]  Actually results in disease.

[01:33:12.953 --> 01:33:14.114]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:33:14.254 --> 01:33:18.217]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[01:33:18.537 --> 01:33:20.099]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:33:20.399 --> 01:33:26.684]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:33:27.825 --> 01:33:30.386]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:33:30.706 --> 01:33:32.187]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:33:32.427 --> 01:33:35.208]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:33:35.448 --> 01:33:36.889]  And their formula really works.
[01:33:37.149 --> 01:33:39.710]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:41.231]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:33:41.471 --> 01:33:45.813]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:33:46.233 --> 01:33:48.434]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:33:48.654 --> 01:33:50.915]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:33:51.115 --> 01:33:52.856]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:33:53.196 --> 01:33:54.316]  Go to www.
[01:34:07.343 --> 01:34:16.447]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:34:16.607 --> 01:34:24.631]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[01:34:25.111 --> 01:34:29.273]  First, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[01:34:29.353 --> 01:34:31.974]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[01:34:32.114 --> 01:34:43.418]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:49.880]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[01:34:50.121 --> 01:34:53.842]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and isn't

[01:35:04.828 --> 01:35:14.913]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:35:15.513 --> 01:35:18.495]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:27.182 --> 01:35:29.984]  Sidney Sheehan with us for another 22 minutes or so.
[01:35:30.004 --> 01:35:34.407]  I want to go to Saeed, Ian, Aaron, Jonathan, Morgan, and many others here in just a moment.
[01:35:35.008 --> 01:35:39.711]  Sidney, you got cut off a couple breaks ago, and you were about to get to a story.
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:50.249]  Dealing with the whole left-right paradigm and how they were trying to buy you off and how the Democrats, you know, wanted you to just go quietly into the night and we hit that break.
[01:35:50.710 --> 01:36:01.802]  I mean, that is such an important point here that we've gone from these self-righteous Democrats who are going to end this war and now Rahm Emanuel and his brother, he's now calling the big Hollywood mogul in the news today,
[01:36:03.695 --> 01:36:08.896]  Arrogantly brags, oh look at how I suckered the Democrats and how they really kept anti-war Democrats from winning.
[01:36:09.356 --> 01:36:11.037]  Oh absolutely, Rahm Emanuel.
[01:36:11.057 --> 01:36:14.297]  One case in point is Christine Segalis in Illinois.
[01:36:14.338 --> 01:36:19.899]  She ran against Henry Hyde as a Democrat in 2004 and almost won.
[01:36:20.319 --> 01:36:24.040]  She wanted to run again but she was absolutely anti-war.
[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:24.700]  So Rahm
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:26.121]  We're good to go.
[01:36:47.475 --> 01:36:52.057]  The Democrats used and betrayed the anti-war movement to get in power.
[01:36:52.437 --> 01:37:02.380]  And Democrats told me to my face, Alex, many of them on Capitol Hill, if you get us in power, if you help get us in power, Cindy, because they knew the energy of my movement was powerful.
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:05.041]  They knew that their base was anti-war.
[01:37:05.641 --> 01:37:08.642]  Their base wasn't just anti-Bush, their base was anti-war.
[01:37:09.162 --> 01:37:15.284]  So they abused the energy of the anti-war movement, betrayed it, got into power, and did nothing.
[01:37:15.404 --> 01:37:19.865]  And then after they were in power in 2007, you know what those same people told me?
[01:37:20.585 --> 01:37:22.586]  Help us elect more Democrats, Cindy!
[01:37:22.906 --> 01:37:27.127]  And that's when I said, oh, this is just bullcrap.
[01:37:27.327 --> 01:37:33.649]  They're never going to be happy unless it's 100% democratically controlled, which I think is tyranny.
[01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:42.074]  Even if the two parties are almost completely controlled, only having a one party, then you really are in trouble.
[01:37:42.154 --> 01:37:47.938]  I think that the more parties, the more healthy our democracy would be.
[01:37:47.998 --> 01:37:49.459]  Our democracy is sick.
[01:37:49.519 --> 01:37:55.622]  Our democracy is on life support right now because of the corporate control of both of the parties.
[01:37:56.063 --> 01:38:02.627]  Barack Obama and Rahm Emanuel and John McCain, you know, they got money from the same people.
[01:38:02.967 --> 01:38:04.368]  So whoever won the election
[01:38:04.428 --> 01:38:05.008]  No matter who won, we lost.
[01:38:05.088 --> 01:38:09.051]  Even if you voted for the candidate that won, I hate to tell you this but you lost.
[01:38:20.089 --> 01:38:23.992]  You know, we're going to go through some very tough economic times, unfortunately.
[01:38:24.012 --> 01:38:29.697]  I don't think it's going to get any better until it gets a lot worse.
[01:38:30.058 --> 01:38:32.700]  And if it does get better, then what is our country going to look like?
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:34.842]  Is it going to be looking like 1984 or Brave New World?
[01:38:37.464 --> 01:38:46.228]  Or is it going to look like a country that is broken up into smaller pieces, which I think would be better, would be more manageable?
[01:38:46.869 --> 01:38:49.050]  Is that going to happen with violence?
[01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:52.491]  Is it going to happen peacefully?
[01:38:52.571 --> 01:38:53.872]  You know, I really don't know.
[01:38:53.992 --> 01:38:57.294]  But that's why I'm out on tour, Alex.
[01:38:57.474 --> 01:39:00.555]  I have three surviving children and one grandchild.
[01:39:00.615 --> 01:39:02.696]  He's one year old and one on the way.
[01:39:02.756 --> 01:39:03.917]  And I could take my kids.
[01:39:04.557 --> 01:39:06.078]  And I could practice what I know.
[01:39:06.098 --> 01:39:12.401]  We could start our own little community that's self-sustaining, off the grid and things like that.
[01:39:12.821 --> 01:39:18.624]  But I want to go around the country and I want to encourage people to work together to thrive.
[01:39:20.865 --> 01:39:25.167]  Through the coming collapse of the empire.
[01:39:25.267 --> 01:39:27.368]  I'm glad the empire is collapsing.
[01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:30.909]  It's collapsing because the people running it are so greedy.
[01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:32.830]  They're eating themselves.
[01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:38.973]  They're destroying the goose that laid all these eggs because their nature is just hyper corrupt.
[01:39:39.093 --> 01:39:46.359]  We could voluntarily give it up as the robber class could voluntarily give up the empire, but that's not going to happen.
[01:39:46.399 --> 01:39:47.960]  Like you said, they're so greedy.
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:52.203]  They're so greedy they don't care what's going to happen with their children and grandchildren.
[01:39:52.723 --> 01:39:57.027]  I care about their children and grandchildren as well as I care about my children and grandchildren.
[01:39:57.527 --> 01:40:01.130]  So we have to create these communities to be able to survive.
[01:40:02.179 --> 01:40:31.112]  I want to go to Coles, but briefly, tell me more about your idea, because I think true diversity, I'm not against the Free State Project, but everybody going to one state, you know, that's a decent idea, because I guess they can try to take the state back over and, you know, have kind of a libertarian idea, that's wonderful, but I think it's better just to have lots of true diverse ideas, lots of communities everywhere, to be examples to others, and all sorts of true diversity, true liberty, you know, out there.
[01:40:31.972 --> 01:40:36.674]  You know, to defeat the globalists, they can always go after one state or one group or one idea or one leader.
[01:40:36.994 --> 01:40:49.840]  But if we have the opposite of the cookie cutter, all of this, the words diversity again, going in different angles and directions, there's no way for them to compute, no way for them to counter, no way for them to demonize, no way for them to set up.
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:54.502]  And if good people will just stop looking for leaders, even Cindy Sheen or Alex Jones or Ron Paul,
[01:40:55.262 --> 01:40:57.864]  But look to themselves to start something now.
[01:40:57.944 --> 01:40:59.005]  Just do it as they say.
[01:40:59.345 --> 01:41:00.946]  Start taking action in some way.
[01:41:01.226 --> 01:41:02.347]  Doesn't mean you have all the answers.
[01:41:02.387 --> 01:41:03.268]  Doesn't mean you're perfect.
[01:41:03.308 --> 01:41:04.689]  Doesn't mean you're going to do it all right.
[01:41:04.949 --> 01:41:06.430]  But at least you're standing up.
[01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:07.330]  And doing something.
[01:41:07.691 --> 01:41:15.776]  And that's my whole premise is that it's not as effective for one person or a couple people to do a lot.
[01:41:15.836 --> 01:41:17.918]  It's more effective for everybody to do something.
[01:41:18.698 --> 01:41:18.978]  I think?
[01:41:37.274 --> 01:41:50.395]  I am retaining my integrity and speaking out against the policies and the principles, instead of just George Bush, that they had to... You know what the favorite slur from the so-called left is to me?
[01:41:50.455 --> 01:41:51.216]  I'm too radical.
[01:41:52.057 --> 01:41:55.100]  So they don't have to listen to me because I'm an extremist.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.041]  So they tried to make me look crazy.
[01:41:57.101 --> 01:42:02.606]  They tried to make me look mentally unstable because of my son's death.
[01:42:02.686 --> 01:42:03.567]  Irrational.
[01:42:03.907 --> 01:42:07.450]  And that was as much the left as it was the right.
[01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:10.672]  Because the media is just part of the robber class.
[01:42:10.873 --> 01:42:15.777]  And like I said, there's no left-right or Democratic-Republican paradigm.
[01:42:15.817 --> 01:42:20.100]  Look at the media is giving Obama practically a free pass.
[01:42:21.241 --> 01:42:30.990]  They haven't covered me and my opposition to Obama, but when I went down to Dallas the other day, we were everywhere in the news about our protest against George Bush.
[01:42:31.050 --> 01:42:31.811]  Why is that?
[01:42:31.991 --> 01:42:33.753]  Because they want to make it a left-right issue.
[01:42:33.793 --> 01:42:38.157]  They want to have it the liberal she-hen is against Bush to remind folks it's the bad Bush.
[01:42:38.577 --> 01:42:42.981]  They don't want to show you going up against Obama and shattering that left-right paradigm.
[01:42:43.281 --> 01:42:44.683]  Tell folks briefly what happened with Bush.
[01:42:45.979 --> 01:42:46.899]  When we were down there?
[01:42:46.919 --> 01:42:47.740]  Yeah, in Dallas.
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:56.003]  Well, we had about a hundred people just marched for accountability, and we had about twelve pro-Bush people on the other side of the street.
[01:42:56.023 --> 01:43:00.665]  I thought that was very interesting, because it was in his neighborhood, and only twelve of his neighbors came out.
[01:43:01.166 --> 01:43:07.868]  But we got a lot of press coverage from that, and it was good press coverage, because they said accountability.
[01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:11.070]  They said Cindy Sheehan and the people with her went
[01:43:13.251 --> 01:43:29.239]  Well, I mean, that is a positive thing, and I think that's because a lot of the media internally are upset.
[01:43:29.759 --> 01:43:30.679]  A lot of them are moral.
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:32.680]  They're just told what to say and what to do.
[01:43:33.681 --> 01:43:39.484]  And more and more as they say no, and more and more as they do little things to get the truth out, I think that's what's going to bring them down.
[01:43:40.205 --> 01:43:46.549]  Well, and I do want to, did I say it on the air, did I tell you when we were off the air, that my radio show is going to be on in Dallas?
[01:43:46.569 --> 01:44:06.782]  Yeah, you were telling me it's Sundays, and give us the website for your... The radio show is in Dallas, Sunday at 3 on Rational Radio, that's AM 1360, and then my show can also be heard on the internet at CindySheehanSoapbox.com, and people can order a copy of my book, Myth America,
[01:44:07.302 --> 01:44:09.023]  From CindySheehanSoapbox.com.
[01:44:09.063 --> 01:44:10.864]  It's just for a minimum $10 donation.
[01:44:10.884 --> 01:44:16.526]  I got several orders last night after I was on Jason's show, so I appreciate it.
[01:44:16.586 --> 01:44:16.946]  Oh good!
[01:44:17.006 --> 01:44:19.167]  People need to support you, folks, and that's what this is about.
[01:44:19.207 --> 01:44:32.754]  If you want to see Cindy be able to keep going around the country pointing out the hypocrisy of Obama and the Republicans, then go to the website and get this great e-book and show it to your friends and family, and also tell folks about our radio show.
[01:44:32.794 --> 01:44:33.954]  Again, plug the website again?
[01:44:34.274 --> 01:44:35.795]  CindySheehanSoapbox.com.
[01:44:36.135 --> 01:44:38.857]  Cindy Sheehan, Soapbox.com, and how many pages is the book?
[01:44:39.517 --> 01:44:41.039]  The book is about 100 pages.
[01:44:41.219 --> 01:44:43.080]  It's just a pamphlet, really.
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.221]  It's a manifesto.
[01:44:44.241 --> 01:44:44.841]  But that's great!
[01:44:45.682 --> 01:44:50.065]  People should print that off and give it to their establishment liberal friends and go... Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:44:50.165 --> 01:44:51.766]  Once I send you the PDF, I don't care
[01:44:51.766 --> 01:44:52.367]  No, it's disgusting.
[01:44:52.387 --> 01:44:54.689]  But you know, this is the process of that paradigm collapsing.
[01:45:08.224 --> 01:45:09.285]  And more and more the left front paradigm.
[01:45:09.305 --> 01:45:10.685]  Everybody I talk to is sick of it.
[01:45:10.725 --> 01:45:13.187]  So I think people are starting to get it.
[01:45:13.207 --> 01:45:14.587]  Let's take some phone calls here.
[01:45:15.368 --> 01:45:19.630]  Let's talk to Saeed in Illinois.
[01:45:19.670 --> 01:45:21.231]  Thanks for holding the last hour, sir.
[01:45:21.271 --> 01:45:21.931]  Had a lot of guests on.
[01:45:21.971 --> 01:45:22.311]  Go ahead.
[01:45:22.331 --> 01:45:24.332]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:45:24.633 --> 01:45:25.053]  Good.
[01:45:25.293 --> 01:45:27.574]  We are Change Chicago.
[01:45:28.194 --> 01:45:29.715]  I'm sorry, your audio is low.
[01:45:29.735 --> 01:45:30.155]  What's your name?
[01:45:30.936 --> 01:45:31.416]  Oh, Saad.
[01:45:31.836 --> 01:45:32.337]  Okay, Saad.
[01:45:32.357 --> 01:45:32.797]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:45:33.567 --> 01:45:38.154]  Yeah, I just wanted to give you, first I want to thank you for having me on and thank you for all the great work you do.
[01:45:38.674 --> 01:45:40.898]  Second, I wanted to give you some news, some great news.
[01:45:41.278 --> 01:45:46.526]  We confronted the thief, the criminal, the new world order filth, Ben Bernanke, yesterday.
[01:45:46.546 --> 01:45:47.667]  Oh, good for you!
[01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:49.629]  Yeah, he came in.
[01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:52.530]  I'm going to hold this guy over, but we are changed.
[01:45:52.591 --> 01:45:53.191]  It's just organic.
[01:45:53.211 --> 01:45:54.311]  People keep saying, who runs it?
[01:45:54.331 --> 01:45:55.852]  Because I first had Luke on and built it up.
[01:45:55.932 --> 01:45:56.452]  I don't run it.
[01:45:56.812 --> 01:45:57.392]  It's organic.
[01:45:57.452 --> 01:45:58.213]  It's just a name.
[01:45:58.473 --> 01:46:01.334]  It means you kind of support what Gandhi said about, be the change you want to see in the world.
[01:46:01.594 --> 01:46:03.795]  And they're going and asking real questions at events.
[01:46:03.835 --> 01:46:04.515]  Tell us what happened.
[01:46:05.415 --> 01:46:07.156]  Yeah, so we got there.
[01:46:07.696 --> 01:46:11.918]  He pulls up to the hotel with his whole, like, they got all the police everywhere.
[01:46:12.118 --> 01:46:17.080]  And I walked right up to him and I asked him about his attendance in Bilderberg in 08.
[01:46:18.334 --> 01:46:26.682]  Um, and he, he actually looked at me and was about to answer, but as soon as I said Bilderberg, he like, like freaked out and just turned around.
[01:46:27.283 --> 01:46:30.326]  And then, uh... Well, you know, we photographed him at Bilderberg.
[01:46:30.366 --> 01:46:31.587]  That's in the Obama Deception.
[01:46:32.188 --> 01:46:36.272]  Oh yeah, I saw that too, and that was great that you guys were able to get that.
[01:46:36.932 --> 01:46:41.597]  Um, so we, we just, he started like running away and all the guards like are holding him down.
[01:46:42.569 --> 01:46:45.772]  Uh, you know, we just told them that, you know, you're never going to have your New World Order.
[01:46:45.792 --> 01:46:48.255]  The Federal Reserve should be abolished.
[01:46:48.655 --> 01:46:49.396]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:54.441]  Come back and we'll get Cindy Sheen's take on that and we'll talk to Ian, Aaron, Jonathan, Morgan and many others.
[01:46:54.501 --> 01:46:55.161]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:46:55.462 --> 01:46:57.924]  It is the 2009 InfoWars Money Bomb.

[01:47:02.268 --> 01:47:03.069]  Thank you so much.
[01:47:03.089 --> 01:47:04.831]  We'll be able to really fight the New World Order with that money.
[01:47:07.352 --> 01:47:17.442]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:12.193]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:48:12.982 --> 01:48:18.324]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:48:18.864 --> 01:48:25.066]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:48:25.386 --> 01:48:27.187]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:48:27.327 --> 01:48:29.727]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:48:29.787 --> 01:48:40.691]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:48:42.984 --> 01:48:44.225]  It's not about left or right.
[01:48:44.646 --> 01:48:46.047]  It's about a one world government.
[01:48:46.507 --> 01:48:52.853]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:12.957]  If we could all see the germs that we encounter each day, we might have a different outlook on how we view our surroundings.
[01:50:13.377 --> 01:50:15.759]  In the past, you may not have put too much thought into it.
[01:50:16.139 --> 01:50:19.741]  But with the current health risks in the world today, it's impossible to ignore it.
[01:50:20.141 --> 01:50:22.182]  There is a solution, and it's called Hazrid.
[01:50:22.723 --> 01:50:31.868]  Hazrid utilizes a fogging device that disinfects, sanitizes, and protects against influenza, viruses, bacteria, allergen, mold, and more.
[01:50:32.689 --> 01:50:35.010]  It's tough on germs, but not on children and pets.
[01:50:35.723 --> 01:50:45.185]  You'll receive the fogger, liquid concentrate, enough to make up to 32 gallons of germ-killing power, three respirators, goggles, protective suit, and heavy-duty gloves.
[01:50:45.465 --> 01:50:49.805]  Order right now at hazard.com, and you'll receive double the order of liquid concentrate.

[01:50:51.806 --> 01:50:52.666]  That's H-A-Z-A-R-I-D.

[01:50:52.966 --> 01:50:53.286]  Prepare.
[01:50:53.306 --> 01:50:54.126]  Get your hazard today.
[01:51:09.919 --> 01:51:19.485]  It was an inside job By the well-connected
[01:51:38.204 --> 01:51:39.205]  Alright, real quick.
[01:51:39.285 --> 01:51:45.149]  Sod in, uh... And wherever he's calling from, my list has changed here.
[01:51:47.563 --> 01:51:49.324]  Illinois, go ahead and finish up your point.
[01:51:49.344 --> 01:51:50.745]  So you're there, Bernanke's there.
[01:51:51.565 --> 01:51:57.828]  We are changed all over the country, wherever world leaders go, globalists, General Myers, Bush, Obama, they're always there.
[01:51:58.328 --> 01:52:01.430]  And the media just can't stand it, peacefully asking questions.
[01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:08.693]  And that's why Glenn Beck and others have called for their arrest, saying they're working with Al-Qaeda and are white supremacists.
[01:52:09.073 --> 01:52:14.456]  And I gotta say, on average, we are changed, non-partisan, but it's more left in the old paradigm.
[01:52:15.076 --> 01:52:16.637]  It's really an anti-racism thing.
[01:52:17.077 --> 01:52:33.260]  Right, and they helped me in my campaign in San Francisco, We Are Change, and I would say that they were very progressive people, at least in San Francisco, We Are Change, and they confronted Pelosi in every chance that they could get because she refused to debate me.
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:41.842]  She refused to debate, we had a Republican and a Libertarian running, she refused to debate any of us or answer any questions.
[01:52:43.082 --> 01:52:44.043]  So we are changed.
[01:52:44.063 --> 01:52:45.564]  I think they do fabulous work.
[01:52:45.584 --> 01:52:47.306]  Okay, caller there in Illinois, we are changed.
[01:52:47.326 --> 01:52:48.707]  Finish up with what happened with Bernanke.
[01:52:48.727 --> 01:52:49.708]  So he just scurried off?
[01:52:50.588 --> 01:52:53.070]  Right, basically, uh, I asked him a question.
[01:52:53.331 --> 01:52:56.813]  I mean, he gave me like a really evil smirk and turned his head around.
[01:52:57.214 --> 01:53:01.157]  And you can see this all in the video if you type in YouTube, we are changed, destroyed, Bren Bernanke.
[01:53:01.697 --> 01:53:07.382]  But he gives an evil smirk and then, and then I keep asking about Billy Berg and then the security just starts taking away and then
[01:53:07.813 --> 01:53:10.976]  We all just say like, you know, you're never going to have a new world order Bernanke.
[01:53:11.016 --> 01:53:16.980]  And it's kind of weird how he won't answer the question because obviously, you know, he's holding something back.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:19.302]  If he's not going to really, I mean, it's just a question.
[01:53:19.342 --> 01:53:20.063]  Why can't he answer?
[01:53:20.103 --> 01:53:22.925]  And he's just running away like he's scared of a question.
[01:53:24.366 --> 01:53:27.068]  And, you know, we try to expose these globals.
[01:53:27.088 --> 01:53:30.311]  We got Richard Haas the night before and the same thing happened.
[01:53:30.791 --> 01:53:32.592]  He just ran away and it was like scary.
[01:53:32.613 --> 01:53:36.355]  We just asked him a peaceful question about his attendance in Bilderberg.
[01:53:37.523 --> 01:53:42.167]  And again, he just ran off and then, you know, they can't answer the questions that we ask.
[01:53:42.267 --> 01:53:47.732]  But you notice we've gone from Bilderberg being denied to now being all over the news that Obama had that secret meeting.
[01:53:47.772 --> 01:53:48.452]  Thank you for the call.
[01:53:48.492 --> 01:53:49.033]  We are changed.
[01:53:49.073 --> 01:53:49.573]  Great job.
[01:53:50.054 --> 01:53:52.075]  I don't know if you've seen the Obama deception.
[01:53:52.095 --> 01:53:53.156]  You probably haven't been busy.
[01:53:53.437 --> 01:53:53.817]  I haven't.
[01:53:53.857 --> 01:53:54.658]  I've been too busy.
[01:53:55.238 --> 01:53:58.341]  Well, in it we go and cover Bilderberg, and we knew Obama was in there.
[01:53:58.361 --> 01:54:00.643]  We confirmed it with Tucker, Estillan, and people inside.
[01:54:00.703 --> 01:54:01.143]  Confirmed.
[01:54:01.183 --> 01:54:01.403]  Yeah.
[01:54:03.385 --> 01:54:05.246]  We saw Secret Service twice drive in and out.
[01:54:05.266 --> 01:54:06.306]  We know Hillary and he were there.
[01:54:06.326 --> 01:54:11.748]  And remember they wanted to have that secret meeting and they kept saying they're here, they're there, they're at Feinstein's house, they're at that house.
[01:54:11.768 --> 01:54:12.108]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:12.248 --> 01:54:13.148]  They were at none of them.
[01:54:14.008 --> 01:54:14.708]  We knew they were there.
[01:54:15.349 --> 01:54:16.769]  The airport's two miles away.
[01:54:16.929 --> 01:54:17.549]  They're at Dulles.
[01:54:18.150 --> 01:54:18.890]  And they admittedly
[01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:20.271]  Right, exactly.
[01:54:43.650 --> 01:54:47.731]  It's just a big robber class conspiracy against us.
[01:54:47.911 --> 01:54:49.772]  How do you think Obama's going to end?
[01:54:49.912 --> 01:54:53.413]  I think people are going to get wise to him, but then they'll just give us some new right-wing phony.
[01:54:54.273 --> 01:54:58.094]  Well, you know, you see the pattern since World War II.
[01:54:58.194 --> 01:55:01.535]  It's been Democrat-Republican, Democrat-Republican, Democrat-Republican.
[01:55:01.955 --> 01:55:02.575]  Why is that?
[01:55:02.675 --> 01:55:05.816]  It's so to keep half of us supporting the state.
[01:55:07.023 --> 01:55:07.403]  Always.
[01:55:07.764 --> 01:55:10.666]  You know, so for eight years, half of us opposed Bush.
[01:55:11.246 --> 01:55:13.968]  Now that same half are supporting Obama.
[01:55:14.408 --> 01:55:18.110]  So it's just keeping half of us buying into the myths.
[01:55:37.143 --> 01:55:37.463]  That's right.
[01:55:37.483 --> 01:55:38.905]  Let's look past the puppets.
[01:55:38.985 --> 01:55:39.365]  That's right.
[01:55:39.385 --> 01:55:44.088]  They're just tools of the robber class, and they wouldn't be there if they weren't.
[01:55:44.429 --> 01:55:54.937]  You know, we have no chance for people like me, or people like Ron Paul, or people like even Dennis Kucinich, who I wish he would leave the Democratic Party like Cynthia McKinney did.
[01:55:55.417 --> 01:56:01.722]  We don't have any chance to get our voices heard in the mainstream, because they're alternative to the robber class.
[01:56:03.132 --> 01:56:03.652]  Absolutely.
[01:56:03.692 --> 01:56:07.334]  Well, Cindy Sheehan, next time you come through Austin, I want to definitely have you back in the studio.
[01:56:07.354 --> 01:56:11.555]  I want to have you on the phone the next few months as things develop and unfold.
[01:56:11.895 --> 01:56:14.136]  Fire out that website for listeners again one more time.
[01:56:14.376 --> 01:56:16.017]  CindySheehanSoapbox.com.
[01:56:16.257 --> 01:56:18.017]  CindySheehanSoapbox.com.
[01:56:18.378 --> 01:56:21.779]  Folks, we've got a big news blitz coming up in the next segment.
[01:56:22.239 --> 01:56:23.501]  And I will be taking your phone calls first.
[01:56:23.521 --> 01:56:25.403]  I'm going to get through all these callers I've been holding for a while.
[01:56:25.423 --> 01:56:25.483]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:56:25.503 --> 01:56:25.563]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:56:25.583 --> 01:56:29.949]  And don't forget the toll-free number to call if you want to donate via phone to TheInfoWars.com.
[01:56:30.029 --> 01:56:30.690]  Money Bomb, that's 888...
[01:56:38.921 --> 01:56:39.941]  201-2244-888-201-2244.
[01:56:42.823 --> 01:56:47.847]  It's raised over $110,000 since people started really giving yesterday.
[01:56:48.147 --> 01:56:50.929]  But it's really a big one-day money bomb, officially, from 11 a.m.
[01:56:50.949 --> 01:56:51.790]  today to 11 a.m.
[01:56:51.810 --> 01:56:52.290]  tomorrow.
[01:56:52.770 --> 01:56:54.912]  And so, we'll come back and tell you a little bit about that.
[01:56:55.392 --> 01:56:57.234]  And then, of course, continue with your phone call.
[01:56:57.254 --> 01:56:57.574]  Stay with us.
[01:56:57.634 --> 01:56:58.675]  We're on the march.
[01:56:59.035 --> 01:57:00.636]  The empire's on the run.
[01:57:00.656 --> 01:57:04.259]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:07.386 --> 01:57:12.370]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:57:12.570 --> 01:57:16.374]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:16.594 --> 01:57:22.219]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:57:22.519 --> 01:57:27.363]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:57:27.583 --> 01:57:28.083]  Number 3.
[01:57:28.483 --> 01:57:33.925]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:57:34.106 --> 01:57:34.326]  Number 4.
[01:57:34.786 --> 01:57:37.427]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:57:37.687 --> 01:57:41.088]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:57:41.348 --> 01:57:41.868]  Number 5.
[01:57:42.209 --> 01:57:45.810]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:57:46.050 --> 01:57:51.537]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[01:57:58.264 --> 01:58:00.587]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[01:58:07.363 --> 01:58:08.925]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.065 --> 01:58:13.669]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:16.552]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:58:16.773 --> 01:58:19.615]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:58:19.816 --> 01:58:25.702]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:58:25.882 --> 01:58:28.765]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:58:29.105 --> 01:58:36.014]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:58:36.114 --> 01:58:39.018]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:58:39.038 --> 01:58:39.358]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:58:39.378 --> 01:58:40.340]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:58:44.525 --> 01:58:50.608]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:58:50.788 --> 01:58:57.932]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:58:57.952 --> 01:59:01.974]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:02.134 --> 01:59:03.135]  Take action today.
[01:59:03.275 --> 01:59:05.056]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:07.566 --> 01:59:10.589]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:59:10.729 --> 01:59:15.953]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:59:16.133 --> 01:59:20.897]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:59:21.098 --> 01:59:32.087]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:59:32.347 --> 01:59:37.913]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:59:38.093 --> 01:59:44.180]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:44.961]  What about you?
[01:59:45.201 --> 01:59:49.947]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.
[01:59:51.408 --> 01:59:53.649]  Call the Berkey Guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[01:59:53.729 --> 01:59:54.029]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[01:59:54.049 --> 01:59:55.610]  Or order online by visiting us at Directive21.com.
[01:59:55.650 --> 01:59:56.991]  That's Directive, the number 21 dot com now.
[01:59:57.011 --> 01:59:57.511]  I was a highway man.
[02:00:15.507 --> 02:00:29.285]  The establishment uses your money they forcibly take from you and give to the private Federal Reserve to buy off the media, to buy off the culture, to create paramilitary police they fund to oppress us.
[02:00:32.472 --> 02:00:42.274]  We can fight back, ladies and gentlemen, and is there anywhere where money could be better spent in the fight against the globalists than right here at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com?
[02:00:42.394 --> 02:00:52.137]  The websites, the radio shows, the films, the mini-videos we do, the video releases, all of it is hyper-effective in getting out there.
[02:00:53.677 --> 02:01:01.699]  And it's been your support over the years, and the fact that I've been a decent steward, that I have reinvested almost all the capital that comes in here,
[02:01:03.410 --> 02:01:04.671]  That we've had a great effect.
[02:01:04.691 --> 02:01:07.813]  We've had a huge effect fighting the New World Order.
[02:01:09.013 --> 02:01:15.557]  Now, this is the 2009 second annual money bomb.
[02:01:16.698 --> 02:01:18.719]  And we did so much with the money.
[02:01:19.619 --> 02:01:30.526]  Last year, because listeners had the idea, we moved into from less than 3,000 foot office, and another even little tinier one, into one big 7,800 square foot office.
[02:01:30.546 --> 02:01:32.767]  And I'm going to your calls in a moment.
[02:01:34.861 --> 02:01:44.450]  So in three months we found the office, a couple months to renovate it, it was a warehouse, a couple months to build a studio, and then five, six months here building this radio slash TV studio.
[02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:52.277]  But I want to build a film production studio, just a little set, a little area and some more computers, because we get bottlenecked.
[02:01:52.577 --> 02:01:56.701]  There's one Pro Tools system with microphone and stuff, we just bought another one.
[02:01:57.851 --> 02:01:58.252]  I don't think so.
[02:02:19.690 --> 02:02:22.213]  The total free number, if you'd like to call and get that way, is 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, or 512-646-1776, 512-646-1776.
[02:02:35.046 --> 02:02:39.509]  And you can go to Infowars.com and link through to the Money Bomb and give by PayPal, give by credit card.
[02:02:39.529 --> 02:02:43.112]  You can give on the Yahoo shopping cart through that credit card system.
[02:02:44.072 --> 02:02:46.374]  A lot of different secure server ways to give.
[02:02:46.734 --> 02:02:49.296]  And I don't care if it's $1, I don't care if it's $100 or $1,000.
[02:02:49.376 --> 02:02:57.462]  The Money Bomb money, that money that comes in, 100% of that is going to go into this operation.
[02:03:02.279 --> 02:03:04.304]  I have decided to up what we're doing.
[02:03:04.344 --> 02:03:07.412]  I've decided to expand what we're doing even more.
[02:03:08.154 --> 02:03:10.660]  And quite frankly, my flesh, you know,
[02:03:11.351 --> 02:03:12.191]  Doesn't want to do it.
[02:03:12.731 --> 02:03:24.594]  I don't like, subconsciously, the risk of upping the game against the New World Order, the attacks, the demonization, the dirty tricks, the extra work, having to oversee instead of one or two films being made, three or four, you know, at a time.
[02:03:25.254 --> 02:03:28.855]  But we're already pretty much upping our game regardless of how the money bomb turns out.
[02:03:28.955 --> 02:03:31.356]  I've already got guys flying everywhere to interview people.
[02:03:31.756 --> 02:03:34.377]  We're already doing it in a month more than we do in six months previously.
[02:03:34.397 --> 02:03:36.797]  We're already getting more computers and doing all this.
[02:03:36.877 --> 02:03:38.798]  It's just that we're getting into danger money-wise.
[02:03:39.398 --> 02:03:39.919]  Down the road.
[02:03:39.959 --> 02:03:53.238]  I got enough money to run the place four or five months and that's not a very big cushion and then I can't expand because that would take our cushion and then that would be immoral to put our whole operation in danger because of tenuous funding.
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:57.581]  So we desperately need to go to the next level, and you can do that.
[02:03:57.601 --> 02:04:00.862]  If you want to buy books and videos as a donation today at InfoWars.com, do it.
[02:04:00.902 --> 02:04:08.184]  If you want to spread the word with an email to your friends and family and neighbors about the free podcast and the radio show to help grow the message, that's a donation.
[02:04:08.744 --> 02:04:12.525]  If you tell your friends and family to tune in, that's support for the message.
[02:04:12.545 --> 02:04:14.866]  Support for all of us together, symbiotically.
[02:04:15.646 --> 02:04:16.767]  Another good reason to give is...
[02:04:18.507 --> 02:04:21.829]  Daryl Rundis heard the story about how we got $50,000 for the Bullhorn.
[02:04:22.289 --> 02:04:26.231]  We were just going to throw it away and Mike Nelson, office manager, said, you know, you ought to eBay this.
[02:04:26.251 --> 02:04:27.812]  You might get a thousand bucks for it or something.
[02:04:28.592 --> 02:04:29.853]  And, you know, buy some more equipment.
[02:04:29.873 --> 02:04:32.454]  And I said, you know, I don't really do eBay.
[02:04:33.234 --> 02:04:33.735]  And he said,
[02:04:36.144 --> 02:04:37.445]  I've done these hundreds of pen and inks.
[02:04:37.626 --> 02:04:38.947]  My wife said, you ought to sell those on eBay.
[02:04:38.967 --> 02:04:39.888]  You could fund the whole operation.
[02:04:39.908 --> 02:04:40.448]  I said, they're pretty good.
[02:04:40.468 --> 02:04:41.950]  I'm a pretty good artist, I think most people say.
[02:04:42.791 --> 02:04:44.232]  And I'm not going to do that.
[02:04:44.933 --> 02:04:50.238]  But we did the eBay, and the real bids went up to $30,100 or something.
[02:04:50.818 --> 02:04:56.904]  And then the neocons posted on official sites their fake signups, how they engaged in fraud,
[02:04:57.685 --> 02:05:14.604]  Which is a felony, and their control number, and it turned out they had fake credit cards, had to be spooks or something, and fake accounts, and then they bragged on major websites and posted their internal account info, how they bid, you know, five million dollars for it.
[02:05:15.732 --> 02:05:18.994]  So it just showed as the highest bid is $50,000, because it wouldn't show that.
[02:05:19.494 --> 02:05:20.774]  That was like as a next benchmark.
[02:05:20.794 --> 02:05:24.676]  Then the people that bid above $50,000, it would start going up in increments, which it did.
[02:05:25.116 --> 02:05:28.438]  So they ruined that and celebrated and said, you'll never get money for that bull horn.
[02:05:28.698 --> 02:05:35.501]  We got threats at the office, death threats, going, listen you son of a bitch, you're never going to get that money, and we're going to do this and that to you.
[02:05:36.061 --> 02:05:36.541]  Well, guess what?
[02:05:36.561 --> 02:05:38.442]  Darrell Rundis gave us $50,000 for it.
[02:05:38.482 --> 02:05:39.622]  You saw it on TV.
[02:05:40.322 --> 02:05:48.685]  That's separate from the money bomb, and that bought two new computers, Pro Tools, microphones, a bunch of equipment, and will probably pay for one employee on top of it.
[02:05:49.185 --> 02:05:50.585]  So, Darrell Rundis, God bless you.
[02:05:51.265 --> 02:05:52.806]  You fail, and I know
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:54.981]  That's not a bring it on comment.
[02:05:55.001 --> 02:05:57.083]  I know you're criminal already working around the clock against us.
[02:05:57.123 --> 02:06:01.406]  The point is, is that God came through on that, through Darrell Rundas.
[02:06:02.087 --> 02:06:07.471]  And people are coming through right now at InfoWars.com, at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[02:06:07.491 --> 02:06:08.712]  They are giving, giving, giving.
[02:06:08.752 --> 02:06:10.914]  Just hundreds and hundreds of donations an hour coming in of $1, $10, $20, $100, $1,000.
[02:06:11.435 --> 02:06:12.556]  They are just pouring in right now.
[02:06:12.576 --> 02:06:15.018]  It's going to be exciting to see how much money is raised by tomorrow.
[02:06:23.314 --> 02:06:23.915]  At 11 a.m.
[02:06:23.955 --> 02:06:24.735]  we come on the show.
[02:06:25.456 --> 02:06:26.016]  What will it be?
[02:06:26.577 --> 02:06:26.957]  I guess $300,000.
[02:06:27.157 --> 02:06:30.080]  Jaron, what do you say?
[02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:30.080]  $301,000.
[02:06:32.702 --> 02:06:37.106]  Were you on air just now?
[02:06:37.406 --> 02:06:37.566]  Yeah.
[02:06:37.767 --> 02:06:38.107]  Okay, good.
[02:06:39.088 --> 02:06:40.109]  Paul Hartman, what do you say?
[02:06:40.129 --> 02:06:40.109]  $1,000,000.
[02:06:40.149 --> 02:06:45.593]  Sounds ridiculous.
[02:06:46.914 --> 02:06:48.175]  No, I don't think anything like that.
[02:06:48.636 --> 02:06:49.957]  If we raised $1,000,000, what would I do?
[02:06:52.912 --> 02:07:00.443]  Uh, the problem is is that I would want to judiciously spend it and make sure not just buying more equipment.
[02:07:01.244 --> 02:07:02.847]  Then you gotta hire the right people, train them.
[02:07:04.970 --> 02:07:05.531]  I would
[02:07:07.242 --> 02:07:09.983]  Immediately just get an already refurbished space.
[02:07:10.263 --> 02:07:15.725]  Because this is going to take two or three months, and the lease keeps crawling on with negotiations for months next door.
[02:07:16.205 --> 02:07:16.985]  It's just like that.
[02:07:17.485 --> 02:07:22.327]  They promised a super good deal, and now it's not so good, and the haggling goes on, and it's gutted.
[02:07:22.347 --> 02:07:25.388]  I mean, it's a gutted thing with a big warehouse next door with rafters.
[02:07:25.468 --> 02:07:27.889]  I mean, there's nothing in there.
[02:07:28.569 --> 02:07:30.670]  And that'll take months for them to do.
[02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:36.156]  So I would probably just immediately go out and get another space near here that already had offices.
[02:07:36.537 --> 02:07:42.184]  And I would stick edit bays in there and I'd hire like six or seven, maybe ten video editors.
[02:07:43.297 --> 02:07:48.638]  And then I'd probably get on the phone and hire some filmmakers I know and get them here to oversee that.
[02:07:48.658 --> 02:07:51.299]  And we'd probably make like 10 new viral films.
[02:07:51.659 --> 02:07:54.020]  No, really good ones, you know, with research and interviews and everything.
[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:57.861]  Because 10 would be hundreds of millions of views, guaranteed.
[02:07:57.901 --> 02:08:00.601]  You know, just hundreds of millions of people seeing the truth.
[02:08:00.921 --> 02:08:02.782]  That's why they're trying to shut the free web down right now.
[02:08:03.422 --> 02:08:11.164]  If we got a million dollars, I would... I'd probably get a security guard up here 24 hours a day, because it's already out of control.
[02:08:12.346 --> 02:08:14.147]  You know, most folks don't know where our office is.
[02:08:14.187 --> 02:08:21.513]  The dirty tricks are really... Every day I get a new news story where people are saying I'm a murderer and I murdered this person and murdered that person.
[02:08:21.933 --> 02:08:22.834]  What's funny, Burmese?
[02:08:24.035 --> 02:08:25.056]  Burmese is out there laughing.
[02:08:28.799 --> 02:08:32.562]  You know, we're all a jovial, fun crew, but I have noticed we've got to get more serious, myself included.
[02:08:32.582 --> 02:08:33.743]  There's way too much...
[02:08:34.628 --> 02:08:35.549]  Screwing around going on.
[02:08:35.609 --> 02:08:37.970]  I'm going to tell the whole crew up here, we're doing some dangerous stuff here.
[02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.971]  I hope all of you realize that.
[02:08:39.371 --> 02:08:44.594]  I tell new employees here, and I can never really hire fans because it's too crazy in my experience.
[02:08:45.034 --> 02:08:48.697]  The first wave of fans that come are kind of like stalkers and you hire them and you find out it's hell.
[02:08:49.877 --> 02:08:52.519]  So we just kind of tell folks it's a regular media job and they show up.
[02:08:52.559 --> 02:08:56.942]  The problem is almost everybody that shows up doesn't know what it is and then sees me and is already a fan.
[02:08:57.622 --> 02:09:00.504]  So that's kind of a problem in Austin with that pool of people.
[02:09:00.524 --> 02:09:01.524]  We've been that successful.
[02:09:02.165 --> 02:09:03.746]  We really have been successful, folks.
[02:09:04.622 --> 02:09:18.071]  With a tiny amount of money, I mean, our budget, about a million and a half dollars a year comes in here, and about a million three hundred and fifty thousand gets spent.
[02:09:19.832 --> 02:09:26.156]  And then the rest of that, most of it I just sock away to run the, you know, to have four or five months to run this place.
[02:09:27.937 --> 02:09:30.939]  It's sitting there as kind of a reserve tank to run this place.
[02:09:31.613 --> 02:09:34.755]  You know, if anybody does fake litigation against me, I can crush them with the truth.
[02:09:34.795 --> 02:09:38.899]  Or anybody, if they try to set me up or arrest me with fake stuff, I got some money for it.
[02:09:39.199 --> 02:09:40.380]  And I got the lawyers lined up.
[02:09:42.621 --> 02:09:45.544]  Got a lot of other little things there, because I've thought ahead.
[02:09:45.564 --> 02:09:47.345]  Doesn't mean I've got all the angles covered.
[02:09:47.765 --> 02:09:48.866]  But it is exciting.
[02:09:49.246 --> 02:09:53.189]  And no, I don't think we're going to raise a million dollars.
[02:09:53.269 --> 02:09:58.934]  But we could if people got excited and got viral and our millions of fans gave one dollar, we'd raise tens of millions.
[02:09:59.910 --> 02:10:01.951]  But the thing is, I didn't really do a good job in the last month.
[02:10:01.971 --> 02:10:03.952]  I don't like asking for money, but once I do it, I do it.
[02:10:05.313 --> 02:10:08.755]  Last month, building up to this, I probably mentioned it five times in the last few days.
[02:10:08.795 --> 02:10:11.316]  I kind of, oh gosh, I better plug the money bomb or it's not going to be a success.
[02:10:12.056 --> 02:10:18.960]  But I've decided, since so many people don't like the money bomb, just for them, I may do another one next month or something.
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:24.143]  Because I've got a rule, you know, that if people try to stop me from doing something, I'm going to do it.
[02:10:25.143 --> 02:10:27.124]  We may do one in two or three months or something.
[02:10:27.424 --> 02:10:29.085]  Plus, the economy is going into shambles.
[02:10:29.125 --> 02:10:29.805]  We all know that.
[02:10:30.185 --> 02:10:35.868]  And there may become a time when we're not getting the video sales and the advertising to pay for... that pays for most of the stuff.
[02:10:37.548 --> 02:10:45.432]  Again, a money bomb just lets us be sure we can buy this equipment and expand, and so I can chart out that I have enough money to do this in the next year, guaranteed.
[02:10:46.331 --> 02:10:48.031]  And then all the money goes to that.
[02:10:48.071 --> 02:10:49.212]  But I'm done talking about it.
[02:10:49.632 --> 02:11:01.094]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, or 512-646-1776, 512-646-1776.
[02:11:01.555 --> 02:11:10.477]  And if you're in Mexico, or you're in Germany, or you're in Japan, or you're in Russia, or you're in Argentina, wherever you are, you donate at Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:11:10.517 --> 02:11:14.218]  You know it's going to churn out films, and material, and audio, and more.
[02:11:14.258 --> 02:11:15.778]  We're going to add a lot of new features here.
[02:11:17.031 --> 02:11:18.412]  I just thank all of you for your support.
[02:11:18.432 --> 02:11:21.253]  We couldn't have done any of this without all the great listeners and the donations over the years.
[02:11:21.694 --> 02:11:26.436]  So many times I'd be in a bind 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago when some $5,000 donation would come in.
[02:11:26.856 --> 02:11:27.437]  God bless you.
[02:11:28.377 --> 02:11:29.558]  And that was before I would ask for money.
[02:11:30.503 --> 02:11:47.338]  And people kept telling me, you gotta ask, you gotta ask, because that's what the Founding Fathers did, that's what Ron Paul's done, and look at how people bitched and griped and said, look, hey, he got $20 million and then nothing happened, and then, you know, he only did 20 interviews a day and marched all over the country and, you know, aged 10 years doing it, and now everything's in the Fed.
[02:11:47.598 --> 02:11:48.719]  See, everything's delayed.
[02:11:48.759 --> 02:11:54.664]  You don't, I always use the analogy of Force 10 from Navarone, great movie, kind of a composite of some true stories.
[02:11:55.645 --> 02:11:56.546]  Guns of Navarone.
[02:11:57.756 --> 02:12:04.342]  It's a true story, but Force 10 from Navarone is kind of a composite of in the Balkans, and they send in some special forces, U.S.
[02:12:04.402 --> 02:12:10.748]  and British special forces, to blow up a dam to flood a road that the Axis is going to use to come across and attack.
[02:12:11.108 --> 02:12:17.654]  And they put the explosive in, it blows up, and Harrison Ford, the other actor, I forget his name, great actor, they're marching out, and it didn't blow up.
[02:12:17.854 --> 02:12:18.955]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[02:12:18.995 --> 02:12:22.638]  And then all of a sudden, it starts cracking and breaking, and the dam falls.
[02:12:22.999 --> 02:12:23.819]  It takes a few minutes.
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:25.782]  It's the same thing, folks.
[02:12:25.822 --> 02:12:26.524]  It's like in a fight.
[02:12:26.544 --> 02:12:28.567]  If you punch somebody, somebody's attacking you.
[02:12:29.368 --> 02:12:34.457]  And I've seen a lot of people, a lot of bullies when I was growing up would punch you a couple times and see what they did.
[02:12:37.213 --> 02:12:39.915]  And I've always noticed winners in a physical fight don't stop.
[02:12:39.956 --> 02:12:41.417]  They don't even think about it.
[02:12:41.897 --> 02:12:43.919]  You go all out till the enemy's defeated.
[02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:51.386]  And people that, especially bullies who think they're tough, they always punch you and then try to, ooh, ooh, have a celebration.
[02:12:51.446 --> 02:12:52.867]  No, the people that win attack.
[02:12:53.208 --> 02:12:53.948]  Killer instinct.
[02:12:54.269 --> 02:12:57.712]  They go all the way, they don't stop till the person's on the ground and not getting back up.
[02:12:58.733 --> 02:12:59.834]  Not giving you any more problems.
[02:13:01.827 --> 02:13:03.869]  And, you know, it's the same thing here.
[02:13:03.929 --> 02:13:15.097]  We need to just go after the New World Order, resist the New World Order, not back off, not wait, not see what the response is, just attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack.
[02:13:15.337 --> 02:13:16.338]  And ignore their attacks.
[02:13:17.719 --> 02:13:21.421]  And ignore their bull, their lies, their spin, their slander, their COINTELPRO.
[02:13:21.481 --> 02:13:22.202]  Ignore it all.
[02:13:23.817 --> 02:13:27.058]  Just accelerate and go after the New World Order.
[02:13:27.098 --> 02:13:37.742]  So 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, 512-646-1776, or as I said earlier, you can donate at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[02:13:37.762 --> 02:13:41.943]  And if you're seeing this on the web in a few days, forgot about it, didn't know about it, you can still donate as well.
[02:13:41.983 --> 02:13:45.925]  It'll go on for a few days after, like last year's, but the big one is this
[02:13:48.424 --> 02:13:52.406]  Hey Alex, if you get a million bucks, you gotta eat twice as many saltine crackers this time.
[02:14:14.878 --> 02:14:18.899]  You know, if I get a million bucks, I will make myself eat six saltine crackers.
[02:14:19.019 --> 02:14:19.979]  People said it's easy to do.
[02:14:20.039 --> 02:14:20.419]  It's not.
[02:14:20.799 --> 02:14:21.900]  I tried it in 60 seconds.
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:27.081]  It would have been painful, but for a million bucks, I can force it down my throat, even though it feels like razor blades.
[02:14:27.581 --> 02:14:28.341]  It was hilarious.
[02:14:28.401 --> 02:14:30.982]  Hey, if I get a million bucks, should I give my guys raises out here?
[02:14:31.622 --> 02:14:32.042]  Probably.
[02:14:32.062 --> 02:14:42.104]  So, I just wanted to call and say, you know, I met you back in 2006 at the 9-11 Scholars Symposium, and I've been following you for a long time.
[02:14:42.748 --> 02:14:48.072]  I woke up with 9-11 Road to Tyranny and this stuff is just real simple.
[02:14:48.152 --> 02:14:51.074]  This is what happens over and over in history and I just don't know why people
[02:14:51.556 --> 02:14:59.279]  Well, it's not even programming it is, it's that they're cowards.
[02:14:59.699 --> 02:15:03.560]  They have no respect for themselves, and so why should they care if there's a tyranny?
[02:15:03.921 --> 02:15:10.383]  Because they're living minute to minute about, oh, I'm going to go to the bar, and then I want to buy a fancy shirt so I'll look good with that girl on Friday.
[02:15:10.403 --> 02:15:15.105]  You know, they're just real low-level, bestial, lower-level animal instincts.
[02:15:16.877 --> 02:15:22.899]  If you get a love of life and a love of science and a love of the creation around us, your mind will open up and you'll fight the New World Order.
[02:15:22.959 --> 02:15:25.560]  It's almost changing things is an inside job.
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:27.680]  We've all got to get our heads screwed on straight, but go ahead.
[02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:33.302]  Well, and the truth is closely guarded by a bodyguard of lies, and that's what you learn as you get in this.
[02:15:33.402 --> 02:15:37.423]  I mean, they take you down the rabbit hole of chupacabras and this and that.
[02:15:38.483 --> 02:15:43.765]  Before you know it, it takes you years just to get on the truth, but once you get there, you just got to push through.
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:45.200]  Absolutely.
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:45.821]  God bless you.
[02:15:45.841 --> 02:15:46.701]  Good to hear from you.
[02:15:47.161 --> 02:15:49.022]  Let's talk to Jonathan in California.
[02:15:49.082 --> 02:15:50.042]  Jonathan, you're on the air.
[02:15:50.082 --> 02:15:50.503]  Go ahead.
[02:15:50.523 --> 02:15:52.724]  Hello, Alex.
[02:15:52.984 --> 02:15:53.984]  Great opportunity to talk to you.
[02:15:54.004 --> 02:15:54.304]  Thank you.
[02:15:54.725 --> 02:15:55.565]  Good to talk to you, sir.
[02:15:57.023 --> 02:16:04.729]  I wanted to ask you your opinion on the Firearm Freedom Act that has been written through Tennessee, Montana, Texas, supposedly doing it, Alaska.
[02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:17.119]  Yeah, they're just saying open carry, basically what Vermont has, and we're not going to let the feds come in here and confiscate our guns, and some states are saying we're going to manufacture our own states under states' rights here domestically inside the state.
[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:19.141]  Because these are their own countries.
[02:16:19.481 --> 02:16:22.584]  It's a federation together to defend themselves against outside invasion.
[02:16:24.042 --> 02:16:25.003]  I think this will be successful.
[02:16:25.023 --> 02:16:30.267]  You think that possibly these states will be more... It's already been successful in four states I know of.
[02:16:30.287 --> 02:16:33.529]  You just listed some of them that have passed it, or are about to pass it.
[02:16:34.310 --> 02:16:36.091]  And it's successful.
[02:16:36.572 --> 02:16:38.013]  If we're defeated this time, we come back.
[02:16:38.233 --> 02:16:38.994]  What does the enemy do?
[02:16:39.014 --> 02:16:39.734]  They never stop.
[02:16:40.214 --> 02:16:42.056]  And people are like, oh, we beat them, but they're coming back.
[02:16:42.116 --> 02:16:42.336]  Good!
[02:16:42.376 --> 02:16:43.557]  It's fun to kick their ass.
[02:16:44.398 --> 02:16:45.979]  It's fun to get in there and go at them.
[02:16:46.419 --> 02:16:51.823]  They're putting naked body scanners now, not just in the airports, but in subways all over the country.
[02:16:52.044 --> 02:16:53.745]  The feds are taking everything over.
[02:16:56.066 --> 02:17:04.248]  With golden states like mine, California, do you think states like Montana and Tennessee will be in flux with people that would be, say, freedom fighters?
[02:17:04.308 --> 02:17:04.689]  Yes, yes.
[02:17:05.389 --> 02:17:10.110]  Everybody's already leaving California that wants to work and has half a brain, so it will collapse.
[02:17:10.651 --> 02:17:17.333]  But see, that's why they want a world government, because the OECD that plans all this, the Organization of Economic Cooperative Development,
[02:17:17.833 --> 02:17:20.054]  The private corporation for the banks that did the Marshall Plan.
[02:17:20.555 --> 02:17:22.716]  It talks about how, oh we have brain drain.
[02:17:23.036 --> 02:17:25.878]  We want an 80% global tax, one-child policies.
[02:17:25.918 --> 02:17:26.598]  It's all stated.
[02:17:27.419 --> 02:17:30.240]  But they say people always run from us.
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:34.243]  So we gotta have a world government, then they claim communism's gonna work.
[02:17:34.523 --> 02:17:36.104]  But not the communism you were told.
[02:17:36.444 --> 02:17:39.146]  Communism to funnel all your money and power to them.
[02:17:40.373 --> 02:17:43.196]  So, uh, yeah, California's gonna completely collapse.
[02:17:43.796 --> 02:17:44.997]  And the globalists love that.
[02:17:45.057 --> 02:17:49.241]  They love things collapsing, because then they get to get even more power and dehumanize.
[02:17:49.321 --> 02:17:54.606]  But, it isn't good if it collapses, because then everybody can run, and that's what's happening now.
[02:17:54.666 --> 02:17:55.466]  Everyone's running.
[02:17:55.506 --> 02:18:04.574]  California is just sinking into the ocean with a peacock megalomaniac going, I am Lord Yahweh!
[02:18:04.614 --> 02:18:05.435]  Terminator!
[02:18:07.557 --> 02:18:11.819]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:18:12.060 --> 02:18:16.963]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:18:17.183 --> 02:18:18.504]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:18:18.664 --> 02:18:22.166]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:18:22.286 --> 02:18:27.449]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:18:27.689 --> 02:18:33.393]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:18:33.473 --> 02:18:33.753]  Yes.
[02:18:33.793 --> 02:18:36.214]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:18:36.314 --> 02:18:38.614]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[02:18:38.834 --> 02:18:40.975]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[02:18:41.255 --> 02:18:42.215]  No harsh chemicals.
[02:18:42.455 --> 02:18:43.395]  No animal testing.
[02:18:43.635 --> 02:18:44.956]  I use them and love them.
[02:18:44.976 --> 02:18:46.596]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.
[02:18:46.876 --> 02:18:47.936]  And I say big time.
[02:18:48.296 --> 02:18:49.497]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:18:49.517 --> 02:18:49.757]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:18:59.779 --> 02:19:06.281]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:19:07.681 --> 02:19:13.003]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:19:13.483 --> 02:19:20.485]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:27.275]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:19:27.655 --> 02:19:29.497]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:19:29.617 --> 02:19:32.039]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:19:32.119 --> 02:19:43.108]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:19:43.701 --> 02:19:44.982]  It's not about left or right.
[02:19:45.363 --> 02:19:46.764]  It's about a one world government.
[02:19:47.224 --> 02:19:53.590]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:19:54.150 --> 02:20:01.917]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:20:02.417 --> 02:20:03.558]  The Obama Deception.
[02:20:03.979 --> 02:20:05.180]  The people strike back.
[02:20:07.759 --> 02:20:11.263]  Going into battle, you would want all the ammunition for your gun you could get.
[02:20:11.463 --> 02:20:14.687]  But presently, ammunition and reloading supplies are in shortage.
[02:20:14.987 --> 02:20:15.888]  Now think about this.
[02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:22.215]  If you have no food, all the guns and ammunition will be useless against the population control breadlines.
[02:20:22.555 --> 02:20:25.659]  In the present battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[02:20:28.575 --> 02:20:28.775]  I think?
[02:20:48.168 --> 02:20:48.488]  We're good.
[02:21:20.286 --> 02:21:28.054]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.
[02:21:28.074 --> 02:21:29.515]  $133,000 has been raised.
[02:21:29.555 --> 02:21:30.796]  Counting Darrell Rundas' donation.
[02:21:30.816 --> 02:21:32.138]  If you don't count it, it's like $85,000.
[02:21:32.218 --> 02:21:34.940]  We need $250,000 to do the changes and the upgrades and the expansions.
[02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:35.781]  You've already seen the results.
[02:21:44.801 --> 02:21:51.826]  So, uh, I'd like to set the goal to have 200,000 by tonight at midnight Central Standard Time, and I'll be here for the full three hours tonight.
[02:21:51.846 --> 02:22:03.073]  I'm going to do an hour of overdrive, and some of these callers, like Morgan, Jake, Ian, Ellen, and Nick, I should give them the call-in number here.
[02:22:03.633 --> 02:22:05.715]  Guys, what's the call-in number on my studio line?
[02:22:06.095 --> 02:22:07.416]  I know I had it punched up on my computer.
[02:22:08.737 --> 02:22:10.018]  It's on the screen right in front of me.
[02:22:10.078 --> 02:22:12.079]  No, I've done stuff with caller lists.
[02:22:12.139 --> 02:22:13.140]  It's not on the screen in front of me.
[02:22:13.899 --> 02:22:15.020]  That's why I tell you I don't have it.
[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:20.082]  The direct call-in line is the same number as the Money Bomb number?
[02:22:22.103 --> 02:22:23.603]  But won't they pick it up out there then?
[02:22:25.124 --> 02:22:25.944]  Then they'll send it to us.
[02:22:26.044 --> 02:22:26.345]  Okay.
[02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:30.867]  Alright, all the callers that are on hold need to call, and they'll go first, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, or 512-646-1776.
[02:22:30.907 --> 02:22:31.347]  Again, 888-201-2244, 512-646-1776.
[02:22:44.178 --> 02:22:46.960]  And again, have you ever been deep-sea fishing?
[02:22:47.681 --> 02:22:49.682]  Well, not even deep-sea fishing, crab fishing off a pier.
[02:22:49.783 --> 02:22:53.746]  You put the crabs, they're greedy, they won't let go of the piece of bacon.
[02:22:54.006 --> 02:22:55.467]  You put them in a bucket and there's a bunch of them.
[02:22:55.727 --> 02:22:57.329]  If they work together, they can climb out.
[02:22:57.369 --> 02:23:02.453]  But as soon as one tries to climb out, the others come over and grab him and keep him from climbing out.
[02:23:02.853 --> 02:23:04.895]  The New World Order works together against us.
[02:23:05.635 --> 02:23:10.299]  And for all their trillions, they're barely in control right now and they're in very, very deep trouble.
[02:23:10.879 --> 02:23:12.381]  What if we all got together?
[02:23:13.260 --> 02:23:15.402]  And started supporting alternative media even more.
[02:23:15.822 --> 02:23:18.184]  And that means you're spreading the word about it if you can't even donate.
[02:23:19.885 --> 02:23:25.489]  Again, I haven't even really promoted this Money Bomb and it's already very successful, but I definitely want to reach the goal we hit last year at least.
[02:23:25.869 --> 02:23:32.274]  So please help us get to the 250 number by going to Infowarsmoneybomb.com or 888-201-2244.
[02:23:32.734 --> 02:23:40.940]  And when you call the front desk with the four people answering, five people answering, let them know if you want to go to the radio or if you want to donate.
[02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:44.330]  888-201-2244.
[02:23:44.350 --> 02:23:50.015]  I do want to take this time out to thank all of the listeners that have given and donated and supported.
[02:23:50.816 --> 02:23:51.897]  You've just made it all possible.
[02:23:51.917 --> 02:23:57.602]  We're going to have an hour of commercial free radio just on PrisonPlanet.tv for viewers and the internet streams.
[02:23:57.622 --> 02:24:01.746]  You'll need to go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to listen to those streams exclusively.
[02:24:02.126 --> 02:24:04.709]  I will take 15 calls or so right when we start the show.
[02:24:06.650 --> 02:24:08.531]  And bring me in with Flight of the Valkyries here, folks.
[02:24:09.451 --> 02:24:11.232]  And then I will cover all the news.
[02:24:11.292 --> 02:24:13.293]  Some of it I got to a little bit, but not that much.
[02:24:13.333 --> 02:24:15.874]  I want to talk more about the Holocaust madman.
[02:24:16.734 --> 02:24:25.357]  We have a lot of inside connections, and I'm getting things that sound pretty credible from people about this being staged and other stuff planned.
[02:24:25.417 --> 02:24:27.718]  So I've got a lot of crazy things I've got to work on later.
[02:24:28.979 --> 02:24:32.260]  There should be some breaking news here in the next few days as well, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:32.580 --> 02:24:34.101]  Thanks to all our tipsters out there.
[02:24:36.545 --> 02:24:38.550]  Another reason we need support is we are under attack.
[02:24:38.590 --> 02:24:41.137]  We've got a lot of stuff to deal with that we don't talk about on air.
[02:24:41.317 --> 02:24:42.059]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:47.513]  We just trust in God and trust in the activists out there to continue to support what we're doing.
[02:24:48.353 --> 02:24:51.035]  But again, the number to call in live is 888-201-2244.
[02:24:51.075 --> 02:24:54.117]  That's also the number to call for the Money Bomb, 888-201-2244.
[02:24:54.177 --> 02:24:57.198]  I know there's a bunch of mail came in.
[02:24:57.539 --> 02:25:01.881]  We've got to add all that as well into the Money Bomb today and tomorrow.
[02:25:02.201 --> 02:25:07.485]  So we'll have the official numbers by next week, but tonight we'll see if we can hit 250,000 by midnight tonight.
[02:25:07.505 --> 02:25:10.827]  A big thing you can do is email everybody you know about the Money Bomb.
[02:25:11.627 --> 02:25:13.309]  We haven't even sent a mass email out yet.
[02:25:13.369 --> 02:25:14.230]  What am I thinking?
[02:25:14.771 --> 02:25:15.672]  We've got to do that.
[02:25:18.255 --> 02:25:29.247]  Matt, in fact we ought to just take one of Kirk Watson's, Kirk Watson thinking of the mayor, Kirk Nemo's stories, thinking of that wicked state senator, Kirk Nemo's
[02:25:30.865 --> 02:25:33.686]  We're going to be right back in one minute, folks.
[02:25:33.706 --> 02:25:34.046]  Stay with us.
[02:25:34.066 --> 02:25:34.626]  Good job, Genesis.
[02:25:34.666 --> 02:25:35.106]  Good job, Oatman.

[02:27:23.154 --> 02:27:24.415]  We are in overdrive.
[02:27:24.495 --> 02:27:30.201]  A fifth hour today on this June 11, 2009 InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com event.
[02:27:30.901 --> 02:27:32.042]  We'll be live here for another hour.
[02:27:32.062 --> 02:27:34.164]  Then tonight, nine to midnight, I'll be in the command chair.
[02:27:34.685 --> 02:27:37.127]  Irmis will move over to the co-pilot seat there.
[02:27:37.447 --> 02:27:39.709]  I'll do three hours tonight on the news and the money bomb.
[02:27:39.949 --> 02:27:41.431]  They've declared a level six pandemic.
[02:27:41.771 --> 02:27:46.516]  Glenn Beck saying 9-11 truthers basically worshipped this Von Brun moron.
[02:27:49.514 --> 02:27:53.218]  Forensic expert Harrity did not commit suicide, Associated Press, we told you.
[02:27:53.638 --> 02:27:55.280]  Our inside scoop was he was murdered.
[02:27:56.221 --> 02:27:57.962]  It is all coming up in this hour.
[02:27:57.982 --> 02:28:02.467]  I want everybody to know we are only at PrisonPlanet.tv right now and Infowars.com.
[02:28:02.487 --> 02:28:03.748]  We're not on the AM and FM dial.
[02:28:04.949 --> 02:28:06.511]  This is a overdrive right now.
[02:28:07.592 --> 02:28:11.116]  And let us go ahead and go to some of your phone calls.
[02:28:12.057 --> 02:28:12.957]  The number to join us
[02:28:14.079 --> 02:28:14.219]  Is 888-201-2244
[02:28:31.718 --> 02:28:34.620]  You know, they'd have specialized creatures that did it all for them.
[02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:36.421]  That's basically what I'm turning into.
[02:28:36.461 --> 02:28:41.624]  Soon I'll have, you know, vestigial hands like a Tyrannosaurus rex, and I won't even be able to hit buttons.
[02:28:41.664 --> 02:28:45.866]  I'll be like, ah, ah, and I'll have like a special person that punches the buttons.
[02:28:46.507 --> 02:28:47.867]  I want to be able to control it.
[02:28:48.648 --> 02:28:50.009]  I want the phone lines in here.
[02:28:51.950 --> 02:28:58.914]  You know, doing this show for, since 1997, with a previous network and then Genesis,
[02:29:00.009 --> 02:29:04.050]  They're always in Minnesota, and then I've always said, okay caller, it's like I'm on a remote.
[02:29:04.930 --> 02:29:11.712]  Like years ago when I'd be at a county fair or barbecue doing my live radio show, and they'd be back at the station here in Austin.
[02:29:11.932 --> 02:29:12.552]  It's the same thing.
[02:29:12.572 --> 02:29:14.272]  So I've done that a lot, so I'm okay with it.
[02:29:14.292 --> 02:29:16.853]  But it's really nice to have your own phone system.
[02:29:18.233 --> 02:29:21.974]  They've explained to me that I know how to do all the clicking and things on this computer, I can go to calls.
[02:29:22.014 --> 02:29:28.816]  But I want, because it's what I was trained with and what I love, a nice phone box with red lights all lit up.
[02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:34.951]  And it'll all be there right there for me.
[02:29:35.771 --> 02:29:37.752]  I'm out there torturing the IT guys out there.
[02:29:38.792 --> 02:29:39.692]  They're very rebellious.
[02:29:39.712 --> 02:29:40.532]  They just do whatever they want.
[02:29:41.833 --> 02:29:43.253]  Especially Matt.
[02:29:43.853 --> 02:29:47.434]  He had some of the guys shut out on the website so they couldn't upload for security reasons yesterday.
[02:29:48.634 --> 02:29:48.974]  We are.
[02:29:48.994 --> 02:29:50.175]  I'm just joking around, folks.
[02:29:50.295 --> 02:29:51.955]  Okay, I got a bunch of news to go over.
[02:29:52.655 --> 02:29:54.896]  The money bombs now reach the halfway point.
[02:29:56.573 --> 02:30:00.176]  $135,000 since we really got going this morning.
[02:30:00.216 --> 02:30:03.200]  It's going to run from today to tomorrow when we start the show.
[02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:06.123]  Please donate at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[02:30:06.643 --> 02:30:11.368]  More importantly, spread the word about the Money Bomb to all our supporters out there that it's going on today.
[02:30:11.408 --> 02:30:12.389]  This could really get big.
[02:30:13.424 --> 02:30:19.528]  Then I found out some people are obsessed and jealous and upset with us doing this, so now I really want it to be big.
[02:30:19.548 --> 02:30:21.209]  My goodness, I didn't really promote it the last month.
[02:30:21.269 --> 02:30:23.790]  I may have to have more of these if that upsets my enemies.
[02:30:23.850 --> 02:30:25.371]  I mean, goodness gracious.
[02:30:27.072 --> 02:30:27.913]  Can't let them win.
[02:30:28.253 --> 02:30:31.995]  Let's go to Kevin in Texas.
[02:30:32.035 --> 02:30:32.956]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[02:30:32.996 --> 02:30:33.416]  Go ahead.
[02:30:33.436 --> 02:30:39.320]  Hi, this is a first-time caller, I guess, and I'm kind of like new to the whole movement.
[02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:40.601]  Thank you, sir.
[02:30:42.156 --> 02:30:57.213]  I'm a school teacher and I actually met you outside of a bookstore and I told you how I saw Endgame and I was really impressed and you asked me what have you done with it and I've kind of taken that mantle up and that as a part of my curriculum in my government class I've made like a
[02:30:58.809 --> 02:31:14.982]  Watching shows like America's Freedom from Fascism and clips of Endgame as a part of the government, I have to guise it in the terms of conspiracy theory for the lesson plan, but I just wanted to let you know there's people out there trying to teach stuff other than just the tax debt.
[02:31:15.731 --> 02:31:16.291]  Good job!
[02:31:16.331 --> 02:31:28.596]  Well, with Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, there's a bibliography at whatistheendgame.com, so you can have the students, I'm sure you've already done this, go there and go, oh, look at the New York Times with David Rockefeller saying he loves what Mao did.
[02:31:28.616 --> 02:31:30.316]  Oh, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:31:30.376 --> 02:31:31.477]  He said he did it, you know.
[02:31:31.877 --> 02:31:33.277]  You can really sit there and show people.
[02:31:34.298 --> 02:31:39.840]  The one thing they really loved was America's freedom from fascism, and they were like, wait a second, you mean we
[02:31:40.669 --> 02:31:41.030]  Don't.
[02:31:41.430 --> 02:31:43.052]  We shouldn't have to pay an income tax.
[02:31:43.292 --> 02:31:43.913]  We don't.
[02:31:44.053 --> 02:31:44.914]  It's not ratified.
[02:31:44.934 --> 02:31:45.815]  It wasn't ratified.
[02:31:45.835 --> 02:31:53.764]  And I was like... Well, you're doing something really radical with... What grade are your students?
[02:31:54.545 --> 02:31:55.486]  They're all high school students.
[02:31:56.414 --> 02:31:57.414]  Yeah, well this is beautiful.
[02:31:57.474 --> 02:31:59.455]  I mean, this is what's going to change our society.
[02:31:59.475 --> 02:32:03.417]  I used to try to go to Austin High and to St.
[02:32:03.477 --> 02:32:15.803]  Edwards and ACC when people asked me to speak, but the teachers are nice, the professors are nice, but school security always freaks out and runs up because they know it's Alex Jones and panic and think I'm attacking, even though I'm a guest.
[02:32:16.323 --> 02:32:25.227]  So I've kind of quit going the last few years to speak at events, but I thought about that and I said, I shouldn't let them stop me just because they flip out so much when they see me.
[02:32:25.247 --> 02:32:28.949]  And then I have to explain that I'm supposed to be there and then they don't apologize.
[02:32:28.969 --> 02:32:31.430]  They stand at the door shaking going, it's him.
[02:32:31.810 --> 02:32:33.811]  He talks about freedom.
[02:32:34.331 --> 02:32:36.112]  But I mean, that literally has happened.
[02:32:37.092 --> 02:32:38.653]  But very interesting.
[02:32:38.713 --> 02:32:39.573]  I salute you, sir.
[02:32:39.634 --> 02:32:40.134]  Good job.
[02:32:40.574 --> 02:32:44.936]  What do your colleagues think of you showing the youth what's really going on?
[02:32:45.728 --> 02:32:53.850]  Well, some of the teachers are kind of, and it's funny, the more liberal the teacher, the more afraid they are.
[02:32:53.870 --> 02:33:01.992]  Because I was showing clips from the Obama deception, and one of my students, who just happens to be African American, was like, wait a second, I don't like this Obama guy now.
[02:33:02.012 --> 02:33:07.674]  And I was like, well, I don't want you not to like him, just because you hear me say something, and you see this video.
[02:33:07.974 --> 02:33:11.015]  I want you to take it, run with it, do the research on it.
[02:33:11.115 --> 02:33:11.695]  Absolutely.
[02:33:13.069 --> 02:33:13.510]  Beautiful.
[02:33:13.550 --> 02:33:29.106]  Well, I mean, just to add to that, a listener made the, and I think one of them's even made a Terror Storm bibliography, and I don't think we've gotten it up when he asked us to, but we had a listener do a Marshall Law 911.info, I think's the website.
[02:33:29.867 --> 02:33:30.768]  I think let's pull that up.
[02:33:30.808 --> 02:33:31.928]  MarshallLaw911.info.
[02:33:31.968 --> 02:33:33.129]  I think we still have that site.
[02:33:33.169 --> 02:33:34.070]  I've looked at it about a year.
[02:33:34.590 --> 02:33:36.371]  MarshallLaw911.info.
[02:33:36.751 --> 02:33:41.674]  A listener made a bibliography for that film with every document, every news clip, everything documented in the time code order.
[02:33:42.114 --> 02:33:49.078]  Then another listener, I think it's in Houston or it's in California, great guy, made the WhatIsTheEndGame.com.
[02:33:49.098 --> 02:33:51.440]  Well, we made the site, but he did the bibliography.
[02:33:52.602 --> 02:33:54.703]  Because it's enough for us to just make the film and get it out.
[02:33:54.723 --> 02:33:57.865]  We have all the proof, but we don't even have it categorized properly.
[02:33:57.885 --> 02:33:58.745]  Just stacks of it.
[02:33:58.885 --> 02:34:00.906]  Oh, there's billions of admitted pieces of evil.
[02:34:00.926 --> 02:34:01.527]  What do we cover?
[02:34:02.087 --> 02:34:09.191]  And then, you know, the listener just totally re-engineered or reverse-engineered the films and went through and got all of our evidence.
[02:34:09.731 --> 02:34:10.352]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:34:10.752 --> 02:34:12.593]  Marshalllaw911.info.
[02:34:12.733 --> 02:34:13.993]  Great job to that fella.
[02:34:14.294 --> 02:34:16.855]  Now show them what is... Put that on screen for folks real fast.
[02:34:17.215 --> 02:34:18.956]  And then there is whatistheendgame.com.
[02:34:18.976 --> 02:34:19.877]  We'll show that to you next.
[02:34:24.099 --> 02:34:32.023]  It's just all documented there, and so that's what makes these so powerful, is that our listeners can go re-engineer what we did and show that it's all documented.
[02:34:32.283 --> 02:34:35.084]  We didn't even make these bibliographies, our listeners did, so we salute them.
[02:34:35.364 --> 02:34:36.925]  Thank you so much, Steve, good to hear from you.
[02:34:37.145 --> 02:34:38.946]  Let me show you whatistheendgame.com.
[02:34:40.366 --> 02:34:42.007]  What is the endgame?
[02:34:42.447 --> 02:34:44.188]  Also, endgamethemovie.com.
[02:34:46.349 --> 02:34:48.610]  You can click on Endgame the Movie, that's fine right there.
[02:34:49.850 --> 02:34:50.951]  Either one of those will take you there.
[02:34:51.923 --> 02:34:52.663]  There you go.
[02:34:53.304 --> 02:34:54.905]  Now scroll down on screen for folks.
[02:34:54.925 --> 02:34:56.466]  I want to show them.
[02:34:56.766 --> 02:34:57.366]  Bibliography.
[02:34:57.406 --> 02:34:58.327]  Click on that bad boy.
[02:35:00.188 --> 02:35:02.289]  And it's a great crime just how busy we are.
[02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:03.029]  We forget all this.
[02:35:08.945 --> 02:35:21.967]  I believe from memory, I've even seen an email, other bibliographies have been done for other films, and I'm so overworked, I'm not complaining, and I have so few staff, and Aaron, everybody's so overworked, and Kurt Nemo, and the Watsons, that most of it falls to the cracks.
[02:35:21.987 --> 02:35:23.448]  That's why we need a couple more webmasters.
[02:35:23.768 --> 02:35:24.888]  Hence, the Money Bomb!
[02:35:25.008 --> 02:35:26.628]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:35:26.888 --> 02:35:36.270]  I get up here with all these sponsors, and try to sell DVDs, and then end up spending half my time trying to fund things, and I'm not complaining, it's been successful, but I'd rather spend it all on topics, all on info.
[02:35:37.634 --> 02:35:39.836]  And so, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or 888-201-2244.
[02:35:42.778 --> 02:35:45.840]  So yeah, click on Introduction, and it'll give you the Introduction Bibliography.
[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:48.121]  Then Roots of the New World Order.
[02:35:48.301 --> 02:35:49.362]  See, it's all documented.
[02:35:49.402 --> 02:35:49.722]  Go back.
[02:35:50.723 --> 02:35:53.625]  That's just Part 1, all bibliography, with a time code.
[02:35:54.545 --> 02:35:56.146]  I mean, go back to Bibliography.
[02:35:56.847 --> 02:36:02.050]  Now click on the second part, Roots of the New World Order, and then it gives you a full bibliography of that.
[02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:05.513]  And then it just goes right down through every section of the film.
[02:36:06.650 --> 02:36:08.234]  Because it's not enough that the listener did this.
[02:36:08.274 --> 02:36:11.943]  We then have to build it and stick it on the site and also do some double checking of ourselves.
[02:36:13.891 --> 02:36:15.511]  Just that's how you can volunteer.
[02:36:15.531 --> 02:36:21.813]  In fact, more important than even donating at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com is to do stuff like this.
[02:36:21.853 --> 02:36:22.713]  This is priceless.
[02:36:23.373 --> 02:36:24.953]  Oh yeah, a listener did.
[02:36:25.213 --> 02:36:29.014]  Go to, we've just been so busy we haven't put it on the site ourselves.
[02:36:29.074 --> 02:36:33.355]  It's saved on Scribe, one of those research sites that has books and documents.
[02:36:34.055 --> 02:36:36.176]  We should get it on our own server because it's taken down.
[02:36:40.137 --> 02:36:41.558]  ObamaDeception.net, guys.
[02:36:41.578 --> 02:36:45.100]  I want to show PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, and everybody listening, this.
[02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:46.821]  TheObamaDeception.net.
[02:36:46.841 --> 02:36:49.042]  I want to show you the type of thing you can donate if you want.
[02:36:49.642 --> 02:36:54.365]  Somebody did a bibliography for this, but called it a Viewer's Guide.
[02:36:54.845 --> 02:36:55.886]  It's really a bibliography.
[02:36:56.306 --> 02:36:58.868]  I guess Viewer's Guide slash Bibliography would be the proper term.
[02:36:59.168 --> 02:36:59.948]  Click on About.
[02:37:00.949 --> 02:37:01.829]  Right there, please, Suj.
[02:37:03.210 --> 02:37:05.812]  And there you have the Obama Deception Guide at the top.
[02:37:06.892 --> 02:37:08.093]  See the link at the top right there, guys?
[02:37:10.233 --> 02:37:12.779]  Click it and get ready.
[02:37:14.062 --> 02:37:14.242]  Yep.
[02:37:14.583 --> 02:37:17.048]  Alright, close down the black box and show people the white box.
[02:37:18.288 --> 02:37:19.829]  Here's a bibliography made by a listener.
[02:37:19.969 --> 02:37:20.890]  Very detailed.
[02:37:21.491 --> 02:37:25.814]  Everything right there for you with mainstream media articles, government documents, and video clip statements.
[02:37:26.515 --> 02:37:31.379]  All documented in another fabulous bibliography that I can find no fault with.
[02:37:31.399 --> 02:37:34.041]  That's the only thing, I research these before we link to them and they're accurate.
[02:37:34.341 --> 02:37:38.825]  These are PhD level research papers people do for free for us.
[02:37:39.466 --> 02:37:40.386]  And I salute you again!
[02:37:41.223 --> 02:37:41.903]  You want to donate?
[02:37:41.984 --> 02:37:42.984]  Donate like that!
[02:37:43.264 --> 02:37:45.606]  Because my mission is to get the word out to people.
[02:37:45.886 --> 02:37:48.628]  These donations are more important than a $5,000 donation.
[02:37:48.948 --> 02:37:50.429]  You don't even need to give monetarily.
[02:37:50.890 --> 02:37:52.211]  Tell your email list about us.
[02:37:52.891 --> 02:37:54.332]  Put up a billboard in your backyard.
[02:37:54.652 --> 02:37:55.533]  Get the word out.
[02:37:55.593 --> 02:37:56.493]  That's what it's all about.
[02:37:56.734 --> 02:37:57.714]  Let's go to more calls here.
[02:37:58.295 --> 02:37:59.696]  Who's up next in order?
[02:38:01.117 --> 02:38:03.198]  EJ in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:38:03.218 --> 02:38:06.580]  Hi Alex, a privilege to talk to you.
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:07.741]  Privilege to talk to you.
[02:38:07.781 --> 02:38:08.782]  What's on your mind?
[02:38:09.645 --> 02:38:12.410]  It was a privilege also to donate to the Money Fund.
[02:38:12.530 --> 02:38:14.393]  I couldn't do much.
[02:38:14.413 --> 02:38:15.174]  I did $100.
[02:38:15.515 --> 02:38:16.115]  That's a lot.
[02:38:16.156 --> 02:38:16.756]  Thank you.
[02:38:17.638 --> 02:38:18.680]  You're very welcome.
[02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:23.828]  I looked at it like you and Bob Chapman saved me an awful lot of money.
[02:38:24.531 --> 02:38:25.832]  In my little tiny netflix.
[02:38:44.403 --> 02:38:46.124]  You deserve that, because you really have helped us.
[02:38:46.564 --> 02:38:49.927]  I turned into you about two years ago, and people wouldn't advise it, but I put all my money into gold.
[02:39:12.542 --> 02:39:14.323]  And I've been sleeping well for two years.
[02:39:15.083 --> 02:39:21.446]  So, you know, I didn't lose money, and I wish I could give you more, but... Oh, no, no, but let me stop you.
[02:39:21.686 --> 02:39:22.526]  Let me be specific.
[02:39:23.807 --> 02:39:25.727]  I never give advice on finances.
[02:39:25.807 --> 02:39:30.809]  I say what I would do, and I would have 30% of liquid assets in gold and silver and other metals.
[02:39:31.950 --> 02:39:34.911]  I bought gold when it was 300, and it's now, you know, close to 1,000.
[02:39:35.571 --> 02:39:39.253]  But I would tell you, if you bought gold when it was, what, 600 an ounce?
[02:39:41.318 --> 02:39:49.264]  Yeah, I would hedge your bet and just to be safe, next time it's up right now, I would dump some 100%.
[02:39:49.684 --> 02:39:51.826]  I'm not going to give you advice.
[02:39:52.006 --> 02:39:52.806]  You do what you want.
[02:39:53.347 --> 02:39:54.307]  That's a little risky.
[02:39:55.308 --> 02:39:59.171]  But hey, it's better than losing half your 401k like everybody else, huh?
[02:40:00.151 --> 02:40:05.195]  Right, and Chapman did tell us people to go all in a couple weeks back.
[02:40:06.095 --> 02:40:08.997]  Like I said, I sleep at night and I have faith in it.
[02:40:10.256 --> 02:40:17.362]  You know, I may lose a little bit, not like other people did, by hanging in the, you know, wrong way in the stock market and everything.
[02:40:17.702 --> 02:40:20.625]  I'm gonna miss some up news and different things, but it's okay!
[02:40:20.885 --> 02:40:24.068]  I say it like I have it in my hand, and I sleep at night.
[02:40:24.468 --> 02:40:25.329]  Thanks to you guys.
[02:40:26.009 --> 02:40:26.670]  Well, God bless you.
[02:40:26.690 --> 02:40:27.250]  Anything else?
[02:40:28.411 --> 02:40:33.015]  Well, probably a whole lot, but, um, oh yeah, I could give you one funny thing.
[02:40:33.035 --> 02:40:34.817]  You need a little laugh once in a while.
[02:40:35.459 --> 02:40:53.672]  I saw in a post the other night about the bank robbery that's going on, and I don't know the guy that wrote this, but he said, the plan was made by Summers and Geithner, Obama's holding the gun, the media's in the hallway providing cover, and Goldman Sachs is driving the runaway car.
[02:40:54.373 --> 02:40:55.413]  Very well said.
[02:40:55.433 --> 02:40:56.915]  Somebody should do a cartoon of that.
[02:40:56.955 --> 02:40:59.016]  Thank you so much, E.J., for the support.
[02:40:59.076 --> 02:41:02.519]  Jake in Minnesota, the great land of a million lakes.
[02:41:02.559 --> 02:41:03.940]  Go ahead, Jake, you're on the air.
[02:41:04.921 --> 02:41:05.401]  Hey, Alex.
[02:41:05.481 --> 02:41:06.721]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[02:41:06.881 --> 02:41:07.882]  First time calling your show.
[02:41:07.902 --> 02:41:08.922]  I'm Don Bermas.
[02:41:09.122 --> 02:41:09.982]  Thanks for both your shows.
[02:41:10.902 --> 02:41:17.344]  I wanted to, one, plug for you, like, just for your products, just real quickly, because I really like them, so you don't have to.
[02:41:17.484 --> 02:41:18.824]  I like the Aran Aqua Filter.
[02:41:18.844 --> 02:41:19.384]  It was great.
[02:41:19.764 --> 02:41:23.265]  And the Calvin Soap was a really good price, really good selling.
[02:41:23.345 --> 02:41:28.787]  Hey, I washed my hair with Calvin Soap and under the arms this morning with the Calvin Bar Soap.
[02:41:29.107 --> 02:41:30.607]  Anything I push, I believe in.
[02:41:31.528 --> 02:41:31.948]  Exactly.
[02:41:31.968 --> 02:41:33.109]  I mean, that's great.
[02:41:33.209 --> 02:41:33.650]  Good product.
[02:41:33.770 --> 02:41:34.690]  I love it.
[02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:41.195]  Another idea that I'm going to go forward with, I wanted to just throw out there for everybody, is county fairs this year.
[02:41:41.215 --> 02:41:44.797]  You know, there's so many small counties, and I'm going to be setting up a booth.
[02:41:44.857 --> 02:41:50.681]  I don't know how much those dealers work, but I'm at least going to have some information on the table, you know, so people can grab it as they're going.
[02:41:51.081 --> 02:41:53.063]  I think that could be really good, and it's really cheap.
[02:41:53.103 --> 02:42:00.608]  You know, I told my place that, you know, I'm going to be doing non-profit, you know, work, and I got the booth for about $100, so it's really cheap.
[02:42:02.110 --> 02:42:03.051]  No, absolutely.
[02:42:03.391 --> 02:42:05.032]  Look, start a website.
[02:42:05.072 --> 02:42:06.434]  Start a neighborhood newsletter.
[02:42:06.694 --> 02:42:08.315]  Don't even make it that radical at first.
[02:42:08.936 --> 02:42:10.937]  Just say, things are getting bad in our society.
[02:42:10.957 --> 02:42:15.921]  I think we need to have community meetings about, you know, as things get worse and worse, having community watch together.
[02:42:15.941 --> 02:42:17.122]  That's a good way to get them all on the door.
[02:42:17.603 --> 02:42:19.805]  And then, oh, by the way, the Federal Reserve's doing this.
[02:42:19.865 --> 02:42:22.046]  What are you going to do if they do, you know, go for gun confiscation?
[02:42:22.307 --> 02:42:23.648]  We ought to have a community garden.
[02:42:24.068 --> 02:42:26.390]  Just stopping watching television as much.
[02:42:26.730 --> 02:42:27.930]  Going out and meeting your neighbors.
[02:42:27.970 --> 02:42:29.871]  Sitting on the front porch defeats the New World Order.
[02:42:30.111 --> 02:42:30.891]  Kissing your wife.
[02:42:30.931 --> 02:42:31.772]  Hugging your husband.
[02:42:32.052 --> 02:42:33.212]  Loving your grandchildren.
[02:42:33.472 --> 02:42:34.632]  Not feeling inadequate.
[02:42:35.213 --> 02:42:37.113]  Not letting them have us fight with each other.
[02:42:38.254 --> 02:42:42.155]  Starting a newsletter, website, local radio show, booths at events.
[02:42:43.255 --> 02:42:46.236]  And pay for the $100 booth, or $50 booth.
[02:42:46.376 --> 02:43:00.462]  Say, buy some Obama deceptions, or other films, and get them at bulk price, and then have them there, and have a booth about Obama being a traitor, or about the false left-right paradigm, or a booth about, if that's too radical, about GMO foods being bad.
[02:43:01.703 --> 02:43:05.084]  Fund yourself, that way you can afford to do it every time.
[02:43:05.384 --> 02:43:07.905]  Don't be Buffaloed that it's bad to be successful.
[02:43:07.925 --> 02:43:11.247]  We have to use the free market to build our system and replicate
[02:43:11.747 --> 02:43:17.374]  Just like cells need nutrients to expand and grow when an embryo is growing, we need that
[02:43:18.206 --> 02:43:26.868]  That placenta, we need that umbilical cord, and the establishment takes our blood, takes our money to create their little monster creatures.
[02:43:27.228 --> 02:43:32.329]  We have to take our money and our choices, our purchases, what we do, and put it into growing the movement.
[02:43:32.649 --> 02:43:33.529]  But God bless you.
[02:43:33.589 --> 02:43:35.349]  Good to hear from you, Jake, in Minnesota.
[02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:38.230]  Scott in Alabama, very exciting what Jake was saying.
[02:43:38.810 --> 02:43:41.231]  Our Jack, I can't see this so small on the screen.
[02:43:41.351 --> 02:43:42.131]  Is it Jack or Jake?
[02:43:42.151 --> 02:43:42.411]  I'm Jack.
[02:43:44.692 --> 02:43:51.697]  Alex, you're a real blessing to us.
[02:43:51.757 --> 02:43:54.078]  We're very thankful for your dedication.
[02:43:55.019 --> 02:43:58.041]  I wanted to give you a few nuggets on Glenn Beck.
[02:43:58.361 --> 02:44:01.243]  I just recently started listening to you within the past six months.
[02:44:01.824 --> 02:44:06.347]  I've heard a lot of Glenn Beck, and there's a few things that I think would be helpful.
[02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:13.141]  One time he needed to have something looked up on his show, and the man, he said, don't look it up on Wikipedia.
[02:44:13.762 --> 02:44:16.182]  So I figured, well, what's going on with Wikipedia?
[02:44:16.502 --> 02:44:18.783]  So I looked up Glenn Beck in Wikipedia.
[02:44:19.223 --> 02:44:24.104]  Now the thing you need to know about this is the idea he's always telling you he didn't go to college.
[02:44:24.884 --> 02:44:29.965]  Well, he went to Yale for a while, had to drop out, had some kind of family crisis and had to pull out.
[02:44:30.966 --> 02:44:36.447]  The thing you have to understand about when you go to college, once you got in, just for just a few weeks,
[02:44:37.313 --> 02:44:38.314]  Everything's changed.
[02:44:38.554 --> 02:44:39.594]  You are programmed.
[02:44:39.654 --> 02:44:41.455]  You understand the university system.
[02:44:41.835 --> 02:44:42.656]  No, no, no.
[02:44:42.676 --> 02:44:45.137]  Dick Cheney went to Yale for a year.
[02:44:46.378 --> 02:44:47.798]  Interesting side issue, but go ahead.
[02:44:49.479 --> 02:44:53.221]  So, I think that we need to understand that.
[02:44:53.321 --> 02:44:57.083]  We know that Yale is the recruiting ground for the CIA.
[02:44:57.263 --> 02:44:57.503]  No, no.
[02:44:57.543 --> 02:44:58.464]  That's where it was founded.
[02:44:58.624 --> 02:44:59.724]  Absolutely on record.
[02:44:59.765 --> 02:45:00.405]  Mainstream news.
[02:45:03.581 --> 02:45:06.003]  Look, look, he's on TV reading.
[02:45:06.283 --> 02:45:19.352]  They had the Violence and Radicalization Act hearings two and a half years ago with the Simon Weasel Fall Center and the ADL saying, ban free speech, Richard Gage is a terrorist, showed his video next to Al Qaeda trading videos.
[02:45:19.672 --> 02:45:21.694]  You cannot make this up.
[02:45:22.134 --> 02:45:28.799]  And then I suddenly saw everybody, including Lynn Beck, reading an exact script that you read now in the MIAC and DHS reports.
[02:45:29.159 --> 02:45:40.084]  And then on his show every time he attacks us, he has known CIA, black op, disinformation specialist on saying 9-11 truthers or terrorists need to be arrested.
[02:45:40.324 --> 02:45:41.444]  He did it last night!
[02:45:42.285 --> 02:45:46.166]  He's saying we're this nut case that went and shot somebody.
[02:45:46.386 --> 02:45:48.767]  And that's got ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center written all over it.
[02:45:48.787 --> 02:45:49.628]  I covered it first hour.
[02:45:52.662 --> 02:45:56.725]  Just absolutely amazing that this is going on.
[02:45:56.745 --> 02:45:59.327]  I mean, look, Glen Beck's been paid $50 million.
[02:45:59.647 --> 02:46:02.910]  Glen Beck gets our confidence by saying he's anti-New World Order.
[02:46:03.390 --> 02:46:05.952]  And then he says, arrest Ron Paul supporters, they're terrorists.
[02:46:06.252 --> 02:46:10.195]  Last week it was white Al-Qaeda is going to kill 300,000 Americans with anthrax.
[02:46:10.235 --> 02:46:12.657]  The militias work for Al-Qaeda.
[02:46:13.237 --> 02:46:14.778]  What a load of bull!
[02:46:15.158 --> 02:46:23.561]  And then right on time, as the Fed's about to be audited, right on time this magically happens with this individual who in 81 attacked the Federal Reserve with fake dynamite.
[02:46:23.801 --> 02:46:24.741]  I think it's all a setup.
[02:46:24.821 --> 02:46:25.681]  I think it's a psyop.
[02:46:25.941 --> 02:46:26.922]  Bottom dollar on that.
[02:46:27.202 --> 02:46:30.883]  I mean, the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL have been caught running fake terror groups before.
[02:46:30.923 --> 02:46:31.423]  Did you know that?
[02:46:33.504 --> 02:46:35.425]  No, but I appreciate you informing us.
[02:46:35.725 --> 02:46:39.366]  Another little nugget is the fact that he broadcasts out of Radio City.
[02:46:39.726 --> 02:46:42.567]  Now, there's a hookup with the Rockefellers at Radio City.
[02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:46.761]  Sir, there's a hookup with the Rockefellers everywhere.
[02:46:47.081 --> 02:46:48.721]  They started all the major hospitals.
[02:46:49.821 --> 02:46:53.462]  I mean, they started all the... Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:46:55.042 --> 02:46:58.003]  Just so you know what's going on with the Rockefellers.
[02:46:59.664 --> 02:47:01.544]  They started all the NPR.
[02:47:01.604 --> 02:47:04.905]  They started all of the PBS.
[02:47:05.025 --> 02:47:09.746]  And so they then put the seed money in, they then get government money, and then they ask for money.
[02:47:11.072 --> 02:47:14.155]  To pay for their own operation to put out their propaganda.
[02:47:15.255 --> 02:47:17.497]  And I'm not saying all of these PBS stations are bad.
[02:47:17.517 --> 02:47:19.339]  A lot of them have been taken over by locals and are good.
[02:47:19.639 --> 02:47:21.501]  But on record, this is their model.
[02:47:21.741 --> 02:47:22.862]  This is how NGOs work.
[02:47:24.166 --> 02:47:44.142]  That's why Warren Buffett and Ted Turner and the Gateses and Oprah Winfrey are all putting their money, their tens of billions, it's over a hundred billion altogether, into tax-free Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, where only the profit on all their money, only the profit on their money in the foundation goes for the eugenics, for the population control.
[02:47:44.162 --> 02:47:46.344]  Remember that secret meeting a few weeks ago that was in the news?
[02:47:48.393 --> 02:47:48.994]  So that's going on.
[02:47:49.014 --> 02:47:52.877]  We have Daryl Rundis, who I really want to thank today here on the show.
[02:47:53.257 --> 02:47:54.238]  Daryl, is it you?
[02:47:54.778 --> 02:47:55.579]  Hey, it is me.
[02:47:55.679 --> 02:47:56.160]  How about that?
[02:47:56.880 --> 02:47:59.162]  Hey, I want to thank you for helping us out with the Money Bomb.
[02:47:59.182 --> 02:48:01.064]  You're really going to do a great thing.
[02:48:01.684 --> 02:48:02.545]  Well, that's why I was calling.
[02:48:02.565 --> 02:48:03.986]  I just want to encourage people.
[02:48:04.587 --> 02:48:08.730]  You know, it's easy for people to think, oh, Daryl's got plenty of money, and that's why he gave the money to Alex.
[02:48:08.830 --> 02:48:12.233]  But what they don't know is I'm really picky about who I support.
[02:48:13.570 --> 02:48:23.896]  You know, there's probably no better way, other than their own family, that someone could invest their money, whether it be a dollar or a thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars, than to support what you're doing.
[02:48:24.116 --> 02:48:32.020]  So, I want to encourage all the people that are out there to follow my lead, follow the lead of all those other people who have already contributed, and dig deep.
[02:48:32.060 --> 02:48:41.686]  Man, I know times are tough, but look, things can get better, but we're going to have to stand up, speak up, never shut up or give up, and you are, once again, the point on the tip of the spear.
[02:48:42.746 --> 02:48:45.007]  Darrell, I want to hold you for a few minutes.
[02:48:45.307 --> 02:48:58.929]  I want to hold you for a few minutes, but I want to interrupt here and just add, I want to thank you for what you did, because it's wealthy people generally that can't give money because they're so obsessed with it, and the globalists only give money into their own tax-free foundations.
[02:48:59.229 --> 02:49:03.610]  You gave money to a non-tax-exempt thing, and even have to pay taxes on that.
[02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:07.831]  So I want to commend you for what you've done, and thank you.
[02:49:08.331 --> 02:49:08.411]  Yes.
[02:49:22.990 --> 02:49:24.611]  Media marketing companies.
[02:49:24.691 --> 02:49:29.192]  Yeah, absolutely, for a lot of money and have done a lot.
[02:49:29.392 --> 02:49:38.635]  And you've dedicated your time to go out and preach the word of Jesus Christ, to get arrested, to get detained, to get kicked off a property, on public property in Dallas and around the world.
[02:49:38.675 --> 02:49:47.357]  You've started TV shows and done so much, but you're another example of the doers and the people that are trying to hold back the darkness and trying to bring light into the world.
[02:49:47.397 --> 02:49:51.719]  But I've got the Wall Street Journal wanting to come here to do this big piece about how we are the
[02:49:52.799 --> 02:49:56.082]  Biggest alternative media outfit in the world, that's now pretty much recognized.
[02:49:56.562 --> 02:49:57.343]  And we're tiny!
[02:49:57.703 --> 02:50:10.313]  George Soros has started hundreds of major websites, made dozens of major films, he'll spend 10 million bucks on some, you know, anti-human, pro-globalist, eugenics film, and it gets less views than my film that cost 100,000.
[02:50:11.334 --> 02:50:12.715]  I'm not bragging, we're blessed.
[02:50:12.735 --> 02:50:13.676]  I don't know how this happened.
[02:50:14.176 --> 02:50:25.101]  But for what we do with 20 people here in this little office, there is no one anywhere out there that reaches this many people with this small an operation.
[02:50:25.781 --> 02:50:29.382]  And mainstream media just marvels, and that is a blessing from God.
[02:50:29.402 --> 02:50:33.904]  But more importantly, God blesses us through the listeners who are great activists.
[02:50:33.924 --> 02:50:36.966]  So all the credit goes to them, Daryl, people like you.
[02:50:36.986 --> 02:50:37.906]  But go ahead and I'll shut up.
[02:50:38.306 --> 02:50:39.527]  Well, and that's the point.
[02:50:39.547 --> 02:50:43.731]  The reason why you're having the success is, first and foremost, of course, God's blessing.
[02:50:43.791 --> 02:50:46.654]  He blesses those people who speak the truth and love.
[02:50:46.734 --> 02:50:56.202]  And the bottom line is, you do what you do because you not only love your family and you love your kids and you want to protect and provide for them, but you love other people, even strangers, people you haven't even met.
[02:50:57.074 --> 02:51:00.617]  You don't want them to poison their kids with shots unwittingly.
[02:51:00.657 --> 02:51:10.086]  You know, you don't want Child Protective Services to show up at their house because, you know, they spank their kids and steal their kids and haul them off to someplace to be raped or mistreated.
[02:51:10.146 --> 02:51:12.268]  So, you know, it's that kind of passion.
[02:51:12.328 --> 02:51:14.650]  In fact, Alex, here's a neat thing for you and your listeners.
[02:51:15.070 --> 02:51:19.234]  The biggest difference between men's great ideas is action.
[02:51:20.077 --> 02:51:20.977]  And that's the bottom line.
[02:51:21.037 --> 02:51:23.378]  You take action, and that's what we all have to do.
[02:51:23.438 --> 02:51:28.760]  Whatever God has called you to do, whatever that idea may be, just get up, get out, and get busy doing it.
[02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:35.742]  Do something, and that's the key to our success, is just to do something, whatever that is.
[02:51:35.862 --> 02:51:40.103]  In fact, the YouDo News website, it is coming along great.
[02:51:40.223 --> 02:51:41.444]  I can't wait to get you.
[02:51:41.904 --> 02:51:45.685]  You're going to be the very first channel on the YouDo News website.
[02:51:45.745 --> 02:51:48.046]  In fact, I have to come on the show, and we'll have to do it live.
[02:51:48.286 --> 02:51:48.947]  Absolutely.
[02:51:48.987 --> 02:51:49.767]  No, no, I love it.
[02:51:49.827 --> 02:51:54.790]  I love that you're launching a true alternative YouTube as they shut that down.
[02:51:54.810 --> 02:51:59.273]  We need to make it big and quickly and you're volunteering to pay for the bandwidth for everybody out there.
[02:51:59.293 --> 02:52:02.355]  And it is going to be extremely exciting, Darrell.
[02:52:02.375 --> 02:52:03.516]  I'm going to get firmly behind it.
[02:52:03.836 --> 02:52:06.057]  When are you planning to launch the website?
[02:52:06.538 --> 02:52:10.880]  Well, that's what I wanted to call in and tell you, too, because, man, I really do thank God for you, Alex.
[02:52:10.981 --> 02:52:13.242]  When I was on your show, I got hundreds of emails.
[02:52:13.302 --> 02:52:14.743]  People are so excited about it.
[02:52:15.930 --> 02:52:28.576]  In fact, a guy who is a 9-11 survivor within the building, he's a programmer and an IT guy, and he called me up, and this is just another great example of people with a passion to do something.
[02:52:28.596 --> 02:52:33.619]  Look, you may not have money to donate, but you can make a sign, you can make a banner, you can build a website.
[02:52:33.939 --> 02:52:41.763]  This guy's way of helping is he's donating all his time to help me with all the IT work and programming that we need, and the guy's phenomenal.
[02:52:42.803 --> 02:52:43.444]  I don't know.
[02:52:59.091 --> 02:52:59.691]  Absolutely.
[02:52:59.731 --> 02:53:05.014]  I mean, getting an IT guy like that is worth a lot of money, but again, that's because he cares about the truth.
[02:53:05.054 --> 02:53:06.474]  He's helping, and that's what we can do.
[02:53:06.514 --> 02:53:07.475]  Not even just donations.
[02:53:07.735 --> 02:53:13.858]  That's what I was saying to listeners earlier, is build a bibliography for a film, or build a website promoting what we're doing or what you're doing.
[02:53:14.618 --> 02:53:24.722]  All I want is to see people get active, and what this show has done is shown people historically, if you take action and get involved for good and just start fighting the evil,
[02:53:27.398 --> 02:53:28.439]  It will start turning back.
[02:53:28.499 --> 02:53:31.260]  It will start failing, and that doesn't mean... And then people always wait.
[02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:37.103]  They want to do it perfectly, or they want to say it all just right, or they want to, you know, take their time.
[02:53:37.203 --> 02:53:38.503]  No, just get involved.
[02:53:38.583 --> 02:53:39.524]  None of us are perfect.
[02:53:39.944 --> 02:53:45.266]  So many people... Anybody that's successful will tell you this, Alex, and I'm sure you'd agree yourself.
[02:53:45.687 --> 02:53:50.949]  You learn far more from your failures than you ever do your successes, and you're going to fail far more than you succeed.
[02:53:51.129 --> 02:53:52.710]  So, don't be afraid of failure.
[02:53:53.010 --> 02:53:58.372]  Okay, just go out, do something, learn and grow from your experiences, and continue to try to improve.
[02:53:58.672 --> 02:54:02.333]  That's all any of us can do, and you're a great and shining example.
[02:54:02.353 --> 02:54:06.294]  So I just wanted to call in and encourage people to dig deep, donate.
[02:54:06.414 --> 02:54:09.034]  If all you can do is write a check or donate money, then do that.
[02:54:09.155 --> 02:54:11.695]  But if you can do that and more, then do that too.
[02:54:11.795 --> 02:54:15.656]  But we've all got to rise up in unity and fight the New World Order.
[02:54:15.696 --> 02:54:18.237]  And before I go, I just had an interesting observation.
[02:54:18.277 --> 02:54:21.398]  I wanted to hear your take on it, and then I'll go ahead and get off the phone.
[02:54:22.598 --> 02:54:24.099]  Yesterday we had Ron Paul on.
[02:54:24.759 --> 02:54:25.399]  It was interesting.
[02:54:25.439 --> 02:54:32.602]  It kind of occurred to me that CNBC reported a story that if the Fed is audited, it'll be the end of it.
[02:54:33.142 --> 02:54:46.747]  And I thought to myself, why would email allow that article in the mainstream media, since he's one of Barack's puppets and he's in alliance with Barack and Geithner and all those guys, why would he allow that story to be reported by one of his news outlets?
[02:54:46.867 --> 02:54:48.828]  And then it dawned on me, and Ron Paul kind of
[02:54:49.463 --> 02:54:54.088]  Touched on this, but he didn't really go deep into it, but I'm sure there's a lot of people would love to hear your take on it.
[02:54:54.428 --> 02:54:55.029]  And that is this.
[02:54:55.610 --> 02:55:01.616]  If they do get this thing through, and it looks like they will, and they audit the Fed, perhaps, could that be the catalyst?
[02:55:01.656 --> 02:55:02.197]  Could that be...
[02:55:03.278 --> 02:55:23.563]  Uh, you know, the vehicle that the New World Order or the power elite people use to say, oh yeah, see the Fed, they're crooked, they've been ripping us off, now we need to go to the IMF, or we need to go to the World Banking System, and so therefore they'll falsely expose the Fed for what they are, only then to try to turn us to a world currency through the World Bank or IMF.
[02:55:24.833 --> 02:55:30.056]  Darrell, it is a super important point you just made, and Ron Paul was alluding to that.
[02:55:30.096 --> 02:55:40.701]  He said we can't let them use this crisis with the Federal Reserve that we're going to abolish as a way to say, oh, we need a new Bank of the World and a carbon tax, which they've announced.
[02:55:41.914 --> 02:55:58.329]  And so, yes, the establishment isn't as worried at this juncture about the Fed being discredited and getting in trouble, because the power is leaving the Federal Reserve as the monopolar center of power to the new monocenter of power, the IMF.
[02:55:58.369 --> 02:55:59.850]  The World Bank's been US-controlled.
[02:55:59.950 --> 02:56:03.393]  IMF is Rothschild, Queen of England, New World Order-controlled.
[02:56:04.474 --> 02:56:04.554]  Yes.
[02:56:26.119 --> 02:56:40.332]  But it's not just that they're letting this come out about the Fed being destroyed, and I saw the CNBC or MSNBC report, there's some others that are saying, oh no, we can't let it be audited, it'll destroy our society, the banks will all collapse, it'll destroy confidence.
[02:56:40.772 --> 02:56:45.877]  But then they're also hedging their bets as businessmen, saying, oh yes, it's bad, we might need to get rid of it.
[02:56:46.718 --> 02:56:51.521]  Because then they want to ride the wave of saying, yes, we're going to have a new bank of the world.
[02:56:52.162 --> 02:56:55.424]  And so they understand that time is against them.
[02:56:55.444 --> 02:56:58.146]  They understand that the great avenger is coming against them.
[02:56:58.166 --> 02:57:01.628]  They understand that the tide is turning, that people are waking up to them.
[02:57:02.069 --> 02:57:13.356]  And so, yes, they're already hedging their bets, getting ready to jump ship and try to control, posing as the resistance, a new global system with even more power.
[02:57:13.396 --> 02:57:15.538]  But that same global system out of Europe
[02:57:16.138 --> 02:57:28.263]  Is a Siamese twin is embryonically connected from its inception and owned by the very same interest, though there are rivalries even within that structure, kind of in the Roman Imperial Court.
[02:57:29.143 --> 02:57:30.824]  So, or the Byzantine Imperial Court.
[02:57:31.164 --> 02:57:33.265]  That's a long babbling answer.
[02:57:34.298 --> 02:57:45.408]  But we have to audit the Fed, show it's corrupt, arrest these bankers, and then that, if it's a true investigation, connects into the European arm of it, and then go on and discredit them.
[02:57:46.108 --> 02:57:50.772]  But yes, the establishment is hedging their bets using limited exposure of the Fed.
[02:57:51.809 --> 02:57:52.970]  Globally too.
[02:57:53.630 --> 02:57:54.371]  They've always done this.
[02:57:54.711 --> 02:57:56.612]  They've always said, Oh, George Bush, the evil right winger.
[02:57:56.792 --> 02:58:01.275]  We need a loving liberal world government to counter the American fascist world government.
[02:58:01.595 --> 02:58:07.718]  And that was a UN paper 12 years ago saying we have to give them a false bipolar world, fake choices of left, right.
[02:58:08.078 --> 02:58:08.819]  So we'll give them
[02:58:09.159 --> 02:58:17.746]  These two different choices of a right-wing, American-dominated world, or a loving, liberal, Soviet-style UN world, when really it's all two wings on the same creature.
[02:58:17.986 --> 02:58:26.573]  So the microcosm we see here locally of left-right in the United States, or Tory versus Labour in England, is the same system globally repeated.
[02:58:26.593 --> 02:58:29.435]  Well, you know what the globalists say, as above, so below.
[02:58:30.512 --> 02:58:31.253]  Well, absolutely.
[02:58:31.433 --> 02:58:37.219]  In fact, hey, I got a nice prediction for you, so this way you don't have to tell your listeners, but I feel very strongly about this.
[02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:46.970]  It's been confirmed through some guys that I know who are not just great economists, but they're great Christians who have spoken words of prophecy in the past that have been 100% accurate.
[02:58:47.110 --> 02:58:51.836]  And I'm being told, and it concurs with what I was feeling in my own spirit, was
[02:58:52.416 --> 02:58:56.257]  There's going to be a massive, massive collapse of the Dow in October.
[02:58:56.737 --> 02:59:01.038]  So, we should see the Dow down to about 4,000 come October.
[02:59:01.058 --> 02:59:03.859]  So, if you're in the market right now and you're behind the screen, shoot business.
[02:59:04.299 --> 02:59:16.063]  If I were you, I'd get out when I can and be prepared and positioned properly in gold and silver and some other hard assets before this thing comes, before the new... Darrell, you're a successful businessman.
[02:59:16.103 --> 02:59:18.863]  What do you think about the lady saying she's 100% in gold and silver?
[02:59:19.203 --> 02:59:20.824]  I don't think I'd advise anybody to do that.
[02:59:21.320 --> 02:59:29.243]  No, I mean, frankly, you know, on my own personal finances, I don't really go into depth and detail too much on it, but I will tell you this, I agree with you.
[02:59:29.623 --> 02:59:42.348]  I'm sitting on about 30-40% of our liquid assets in gold and silver, and then some other of our money is sitting in real estate and looking for some good buys and things like that, things that ultimately people, you know,
[02:59:42.928 --> 02:59:51.497]  My wife knows some wealthy Italians that are family friends, and they say, put it in mortar, put it in mortar, and that's all the old world people are doing because they know when inflation comes, put it in mortar.
[03:00:06.451 --> 03:00:10.897]  Even if it's being devalued later when they go into hyperinflation, it's just going to go right back up.
[03:00:11.178 --> 03:00:12.960]  And so you won't really get any profit out of it.
[03:00:13.201 --> 03:00:17.627]  You'll just get your original value whenever you jump out of real estate at whatever the currency's at.
[03:00:18.370 --> 03:00:27.617]  Well, then a lot of these people who were caught unaware, who have now been foreclosed on or about to be because they're currently laid off and they can't get a job, they're going to be looking for a place to rent.
[03:00:27.977 --> 03:00:37.464]  So even if you're buying small, single-family homes, you know, $100,000 or $200,000 houses, you'll have plenty of people standing in line to rent them, you know, so that they won't go vacant.
[03:00:37.604 --> 03:00:38.785]  People still need a place to live.
[03:00:39.025 --> 03:00:39.665]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:00:39.725 --> 03:00:46.170]  In fact, it's the big million, $2 million, $5 million houses they can't sell, but little houses are actually going up in Austin.
[03:00:46.874 --> 03:00:47.655]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:00:47.675 --> 03:00:55.420]  And they're a good value, and once again, they're slowing down on the building of new homes and existing home sales are where it's at right now.
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:00:59.924]  So, you can even get into some of these deals with builders who are desperate to sell.
[03:00:59.944 --> 03:01:01.545]  I mean, it's an old adage.
[03:01:01.585 --> 03:01:03.386]  Some I've lived by, and it's served me well.
[03:01:03.787 --> 03:01:08.170]  You only buy from people who are desperate to sell, and you only sell to people who are desperate to buy.
[03:01:08.889 --> 03:01:11.290]  And right now, there's a lot of people who are desperate to sell out there.
[03:01:11.370 --> 03:01:16.792]  So, if you do your due diligence and you take your time, you can get in on some pretty good deals.
[03:01:16.832 --> 03:01:19.633]  But yes, gold and silver, there's nothing better.
[03:01:19.653 --> 03:01:25.975]  There's nothing that makes me sleep better at night than knowing that I've got a third of my assets, my liquid assets, in gold and silver, because they're only going to go up.
[03:01:26.315 --> 03:01:27.955]  Gold and silver have never been worth nothing.
[03:01:27.975 --> 03:01:30.416]  So, it's definitely a good place to... That's right.
[03:01:30.456 --> 03:01:34.197]  It may go down at some point, but it always, over time, just goes up as they inflate the currency.
[03:01:34.497 --> 03:01:36.338]  Daryl Rondas, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:01:36.687 --> 03:01:38.948]  Hey, God bless you, and hey guys, write that check.
[03:01:39.028 --> 03:01:40.829]  Call up and donate to the Money Bomb.
[03:01:40.989 --> 03:01:46.792]  Alex could use all your help and all your support, and believe me, every penny you donate will be put to good use.
[03:01:46.852 --> 03:01:47.913]  No two ways about it, folks.
[03:01:48.273 --> 03:01:49.254]  Absolutely.
[03:01:49.354 --> 03:01:49.694]  Take care.
[03:01:50.134 --> 03:01:50.734]  Thank you, Daryl.
[03:01:51.275 --> 03:01:52.235]  Absolutely, folks.
[03:01:52.495 --> 03:01:59.179]  Yeah, to be clear, I take some of the money from video sales and advertising, and that's what I support myself with.
[03:02:00.014 --> 03:02:02.016]  And frankly, all my possessions are big hassles.
[03:02:02.076 --> 03:02:04.478]  A car, a house, water heaters breaking.
[03:02:04.538 --> 03:02:06.579]  I wish I lived in a giant tent in the woods.
[03:02:06.619 --> 03:02:07.780]  Believe me, I'm an outdoorsman.
[03:02:08.261 --> 03:02:09.522]  People say, well, what's this money go to?
[03:02:09.962 --> 03:02:15.106]  I take the money that comes out of the money bomb and I look at equipment and buildings and people and I go, okay, hire them!
[03:02:16.087 --> 03:02:17.268]  And that's what's going to happen.
[03:02:18.309 --> 03:02:21.892]  And it means a lot of hours here with me with new people telling them what I want and trying to train them.
[03:02:24.874 --> 03:02:28.055]  If it's a new employee and they start saying they want to carry out terror attacks, we know it's the Fed.
[03:02:28.075 --> 03:02:29.095]  We've got to kick them out of here.
[03:02:29.135 --> 03:02:29.876]  That's how it works.
[03:02:30.996 --> 03:02:32.136]  I don't enjoy hiring new people.
[03:02:32.176 --> 03:02:32.816]  It's never fun.
[03:02:32.856 --> 03:02:34.937]  But yeah, we're going to do it.
[03:02:35.937 --> 03:02:36.817]  It's a labor of love.
[03:02:37.798 --> 03:02:39.198]  InfoWars Money Bomb, going right now.
[03:02:39.238 --> 03:02:40.479]  In fact, can you call Mike in here?
[03:02:41.179 --> 03:02:45.240]  Or somebody, can you tell me it was $135,000 about 45 minutes ago.
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:48.421]  I want to see if it's still coming in or how it's going.
[03:02:48.441 --> 03:02:50.001]  888-201-2244 to call and make a donation.
[03:02:54.915 --> 03:02:56.416]  So another 9,000 came in.
[03:02:57.216 --> 03:02:58.257]  So 9,000 just came in.
[03:02:58.817 --> 03:02:59.817]  Put it on the board, baby!
[03:02:59.977 --> 03:03:00.418]  Ha ha!
[03:03:00.858 --> 03:03:01.618]  That is exciting.
[03:03:01.958 --> 03:03:05.620]  At that rate, let's say we keep raising, what is it, about $10,000 an hour?
[03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:11.923]  Let's say $8,000 until tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[03:03:11.943 --> 03:03:13.564]  You know, it'll slow down overnight and all that.
[03:03:14.644 --> 03:03:15.025]  Will we make $250,000?
[03:03:15.105 --> 03:03:15.545]  I don't think so.
[03:03:18.789 --> 03:03:19.910]  Also, as I'm saying, we're doing great.
[03:03:19.930 --> 03:03:20.250]  We're not.
[03:03:20.270 --> 03:03:20.950]  We're not doing great.
[03:03:21.231 --> 03:03:22.652]  Folks, be sure and donate.
[03:03:22.672 --> 03:03:23.132]  888-201-2244.
[03:03:23.252 --> 03:03:28.355]  And people will be here until 1 o'clock tonight or Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[03:03:28.776 --> 03:03:30.717]  And we can keep giving over the next few days as well.
[03:03:30.737 --> 03:03:31.798]  The biggest thing is spread the word.
[03:03:32.018 --> 03:03:38.062]  Guys, we've got to get that email out to people as soon as the show ends.
[03:03:39.923 --> 03:03:41.244]  Be just short of $250 at that rate.
[03:03:44.707 --> 03:03:45.528]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[03:03:45.548 --> 03:03:46.329]  How are you doing?
[03:04:03.064 --> 03:04:06.787]  I just want to say it's great that you're putting out this message.
[03:04:06.947 --> 03:04:11.811]  I'm friendly behind you and it's unfortunate because I try to spread it.
[03:04:11.911 --> 03:04:16.215]  I go to high school over here and it seems like a lot of people seem to resist the info.
[03:04:16.255 --> 03:04:17.496]  They just don't want to hear it.
[03:04:19.477 --> 03:04:23.059]  Yeah, but if you tried to tell them about the Magna Carta of 1215, they'd resist it.
[03:04:23.579 --> 03:04:29.422]  I mean, if you were talking about the coolest skateboards, or the coolest tattoos, or the coolest iPhone app, they would.
[03:04:29.722 --> 03:04:34.585]  They've just been trained to not... They go about their life like they flip a light switch, power comes on.
[03:04:34.605 --> 03:04:37.286]  They go to the store, there's red stuff called meat that tastes good.
[03:04:37.566 --> 03:04:48.292]  They don't think about how it was produced, the cow, you know, the breeding, the whole... They don't think about power plants, and systems, and the planet, and where everything comes from, and how things interconnect.
[03:04:48.792 --> 03:04:49.912]  Those people don't count.
[03:04:49.932 --> 03:04:53.413]  I mean, you can plant a seed, later they may wake up years down the road.
[03:04:53.694 --> 03:04:54.954]  And that tends to happen.
[03:04:55.214 --> 03:04:56.654]  You want to find those that do care.
[03:04:57.835 --> 03:05:02.156]  Yeah, it's just, yeah, like, it's great because, you know, I do try to talk about it quite a bit.
[03:05:02.536 --> 03:05:08.098]  And, you know, it's great to see, like, some of my friends actually waking up and doing some of their own research and, you know, actually find out what the truth is.
[03:05:09.438 --> 03:05:10.179]  God bless you, sir.
[03:05:10.239 --> 03:05:11.479]  I really appreciate your call.
[03:05:11.499 --> 03:05:13.059]  Let's talk to Tom in New York.
[03:05:13.520 --> 03:05:14.320]  Tom, you're on the air.
[03:05:14.420 --> 03:05:14.740]  Welcome.
[03:05:19.793 --> 03:05:20.473]  Hey, Tom, you there?
[03:05:20.493 --> 03:05:24.415]  I can hear... Okay, Tom's there now.
[03:05:24.475 --> 03:05:25.175]  Tom, go ahead, sir.
[03:05:27.656 --> 03:05:28.696]  Um, I'm not Tom.
[03:05:29.856 --> 03:05:31.197]  Okay, Nick in Ontario.
[03:05:31.277 --> 03:05:33.978]  It says Tom on my screen, but okay.
[03:05:34.058 --> 03:05:34.818]  Nick in Ontario.
[03:05:34.838 --> 03:05:35.318]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:05:35.338 --> 03:05:40.060]  Okay, he... Hello?
[03:05:41.901 --> 03:05:42.261]  Hello?
[03:05:43.521 --> 03:05:44.762]  Tom in... Tom in... I'm gonna try it again.
[03:05:44.822 --> 03:05:45.422]  Tom in New York.
[03:05:46.593 --> 03:05:47.534]  Anybody there?
[03:05:47.554 --> 03:05:47.994]  Let him go.
[03:05:48.014 --> 03:05:49.075]  Go ahead and let him go.
[03:05:49.275 --> 03:05:50.617]  I don't like this phone system, guys.
[03:05:50.657 --> 03:05:51.617]  It's just endless trouble.
[03:05:51.958 --> 03:05:56.361]  I know it's all fun to be on the internet using phones and stuff, but we're going to get phone lines in here.
[03:05:56.381 --> 03:05:57.362]  It's going to happen.
[03:05:58.703 --> 03:06:03.027]  It's like I'm ignored about this, though, because I really want to go with regular phone lines.
[03:06:03.568 --> 03:06:05.289]  That absolutely is what I want.
[03:06:05.950 --> 03:06:07.251]  I'll just call the phone company myself.
[03:06:07.931 --> 03:06:11.514]  I'm going to try this again because I really can't hear you when you're talking to me in there.
[03:06:11.534 --> 03:06:12.075]  Who's up next?
[03:06:14.281 --> 03:06:15.282]  Morgan in Montana.
[03:06:15.322 --> 03:06:16.162]  Morgan, you're on the air.
[03:06:16.182 --> 03:06:16.602]  Go ahead.
[03:06:17.603 --> 03:06:20.764]  Alright, I finally got on after like an hour and thirty minutes.
[03:06:21.065 --> 03:06:21.725]  I'm not kidding.
[03:06:21.745 --> 03:06:24.706]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:06:25.007 --> 03:06:25.347]  Thank you.
[03:06:26.207 --> 03:06:27.208]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:06:27.248 --> 03:06:32.210]  I'm a first-time caller, although I feel like I know you a little bit.
[03:06:32.250 --> 03:06:34.972]  I've been listening to you for about a year now.
[03:06:35.092 --> 03:06:39.334]  My wife reminds me when you're on TV on Sundays on the public channel.
[03:06:40.534 --> 03:06:40.935]  Oh, really?
[03:06:41.015 --> 03:06:43.056]  I'm on in your local town on AXS TV?
[03:06:44.661 --> 03:06:50.522]  You know, I forget the amazing power of AXS TV, which they're trying to shut down.
[03:06:50.542 --> 03:06:53.363]  They've shut down about half of them, but they're still everywhere, folks.
[03:06:53.623 --> 03:06:53.923]  Use them!
[03:06:54.383 --> 03:06:54.703]  Awesome!
[03:06:54.743 --> 03:06:55.183]  Keep going.
[03:06:56.043 --> 03:06:57.703]  You can only imagine.
[03:06:58.203 --> 03:06:59.344]  Well, I don't know where to start.
[03:06:59.404 --> 03:07:01.144]  I have a few questions.
[03:07:01.224 --> 03:07:03.144]  If you can answer them, that would be fantastic.
[03:07:03.204 --> 03:07:05.165]  Go ahead.
[03:07:05.185 --> 03:07:08.145]  First of all, I commend you for your work.
[03:07:08.205 --> 03:07:11.286]  I think if you continue to follow... if you continue to...
[03:07:13.041 --> 03:07:15.483]  You know, uh, follow your convictions for the truth.
[03:07:16.224 --> 03:07:22.850]  Um, the Lord will definitely, uh, you know, uh, will make you succeed.
[03:07:22.870 --> 03:07:24.011]  Well, not just succeeding.
[03:07:24.112 --> 03:07:26.534]  I wouldn't be alive right now if I wasn't being protected by God.
[03:07:26.554 --> 03:07:28.015]  There's no doubt that's what's going on.
[03:07:28.976 --> 03:07:29.537]  Absolutely.
[03:07:29.817 --> 03:07:32.139]  And the fool has said in his heart there is no God.
[03:07:32.479 --> 03:07:34.341]  There are no atheists in foxholes, but go ahead.
[03:07:35.222 --> 03:07:36.683]  In the fruit of your words, you know.
[03:07:37.164 --> 03:07:38.165]  And so, anyhow, uh,
[03:07:39.198 --> 03:07:46.180]  I'd like to give you, first of all, just a little bit of words of encouragement, because I know that we all can use that.
[03:07:46.740 --> 03:08:00.383]  I was talking with a doctor friend of mine out of Great Falls, Montana, and I was visiting him and just doing a sales call, and he asked me if I had ever seen the Obama deception, which was the wrong thing to ask me, because
[03:08:01.039 --> 03:08:10.568]  I'm not kidding!
[03:08:11.449 --> 03:08:18.415]  I've been going to Port Aransas every summer ever since I was a little kid and my daddy did it and his daddy did it and I go down there fishing and stuff.
[03:08:19.056 --> 03:08:23.120]  I mean now every restaurant I went to, fans, there could be 10 people in the restaurant.
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:34.522]  Not from Austin, from, you know, Minnesota coming down there, and Houston, and I'd be driving down the beach on a rented golf cart with my kids, and pass cars, and, Alex, Alex, Alex!
[03:08:34.842 --> 03:08:42.864]  And I'm like, and everywhere I go, it's just all over the... Sir, we have really reached a lot of people, and that's what I'm saying.
[03:08:43.424 --> 03:08:44.904]  Imagine how many people we've already reached.
[03:08:44.964 --> 03:08:50.385]  If I double what we're reaching in the next year, if we get enough money in the money bomb to fund it, can you imagine the effect?
[03:08:52.023 --> 03:08:57.327]  Oh yeah, but he didn't know who you were, he didn't know who actually produced it.
[03:08:57.707 --> 03:08:59.648]  No, no, no, I know, exactly, exactly.
[03:09:00.209 --> 03:09:04.092]  I've heard people talking about my films in other cities when they don't know I made them.
[03:09:04.192 --> 03:09:06.453]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:09:06.673 --> 03:09:13.798]  Anyhow, I mean, in Great Falls, Montana, people are, you know, the word's getting out, so I commend you on that.
[03:09:15.407 --> 03:09:16.728]  No, I commend you.
[03:09:16.748 --> 03:09:17.688]  I commend you.
[03:09:17.708 --> 03:09:20.829]  It is you that is fighting the new order.
[03:09:20.869 --> 03:09:22.430]  It is you that is changing the world.
[03:09:22.610 --> 03:09:24.411]  It is not the globalists that will determine it.
[03:09:24.531 --> 03:09:26.111]  It is we the people.
[03:09:26.491 --> 03:09:27.212]  You!
[03:09:35.842 --> 03:09:45.028]  I did a little, you know, of course, research on my own, you know, the World Health Organization, CFR, the Bilderberg Group, you know, and they're trying to link them together.
[03:09:46.329 --> 03:09:57.236]  One of your past scholarly interviews mentioned that he did a recog and called Hannity, and I freaking said, I was on the phone, are you there still?
[03:09:57.676 --> 03:09:58.576]  Yes, I am.
[03:09:59.257 --> 03:10:02.419]  I was on the phone, I finally got into Hannity, who
[03:10:03.365 --> 03:10:07.027]  Probably, you're probably, but almost, it's probably harder to get a hold of.
[03:10:07.047 --> 03:10:08.988]  Um, and I finally got on there.
[03:10:09.008 --> 03:10:10.189]  I had to pretend I was a liberal.
[03:10:10.830 --> 03:10:12.330]  You have to basically be a liberal.
[03:10:12.350 --> 03:10:13.391]  They ask you, are you a liberal?
[03:10:13.411 --> 03:10:16.073]  And I'm like, oh yeah, hey, what's going on, you know?
[03:10:16.113 --> 03:10:22.316]  And so I finally, I asked, you know, what do you know, what can you tell me about the Bill de Burgh group?
[03:10:22.617 --> 03:10:23.697]  Why do you keep denying it?
[03:10:24.778 --> 03:10:29.721]  And he freaking, in his background, you know, uh, voice, kook, kook.
[03:10:30.281 --> 03:10:31.222]  I'm like, look,
[03:10:32.116 --> 03:10:33.637]  Why are you lying?
[03:10:34.297 --> 03:10:37.458]  I mean, you can go online and look.
[03:10:37.878 --> 03:10:45.300]  He looks stupid now because it's in Politico and CBS News and everywhere that they are running the planet, but they go, well, they're smart, they need to run it.
[03:10:45.660 --> 03:10:49.582]  They've gone from none of it exists to, well, of course it exists, we need to run things.
[03:10:50.202 --> 03:10:51.162]  So very, very exciting.
[03:10:51.202 --> 03:10:53.363]  Anything else there, Morgan in Montana?
[03:10:54.144 --> 03:10:55.265]  Tell me with regards to 911.
[03:11:09.679 --> 03:11:16.163]  What was the single most important fact that opened your eyes and said, there's no doubt?
[03:11:16.183 --> 03:11:16.983]  For me it was Building 7.
[03:11:19.044 --> 03:11:25.108]  Okay, I'll tell you how six months before 9-11 I went on air and said they're going to stage terror attacks in the U.S.
[03:11:25.628 --> 03:11:26.949]  and set up Homeland Security.
[03:11:27.409 --> 03:11:28.169]  You know how I knew that?
[03:11:28.750 --> 03:11:36.314]  I was reading Army documents on air where they said we're going to have terror attacks and a NORTHCOM that Clinton has proposed years ago will be set up
[03:11:37.390 --> 03:11:40.973]  And then I saw them going, here's Bin Laden on the news, he's going to get you.
[03:11:41.053 --> 03:11:43.455]  When he attacks, give up all your rights.
[03:11:43.475 --> 03:11:46.878]  It was like a Jim Jones Kool-Aid drinking drill.
[03:11:47.779 --> 03:11:49.140]  Okay, because they drill you first.
[03:11:49.240 --> 03:11:57.227]  And I saw all the preparations on TV, and I was running on the treadmill, like July 23rd, I think, and I was watching hours of Fox News.
[03:11:57.247 --> 03:11:59.669]  I was trying to get in shape back then, like I am doing once again.
[03:11:59.689 --> 03:12:00.730]  I've done pretty good too.
[03:12:00.810 --> 03:12:01.791]  I lost 30 pounds now.
[03:12:02.332 --> 03:12:03.653]  30 pounds this morning, yes!
[03:12:03.733 --> 03:12:04.614]  But anyway, side issue.
[03:12:06.509 --> 03:12:10.613]  I never cared what I looked like much, but then my enemies got off on the fact that I was a little overweight, so I'm sorry.
[03:12:10.653 --> 03:12:13.976]  I'm afraid I'm going to go down to bodybuilder size again.
[03:12:14.597 --> 03:12:17.039]  But anyways, side issue, because that makes the enemies mad.
[03:12:17.059 --> 03:12:19.281]  We're going to have another money bomb now that they're upset about it.
[03:12:19.601 --> 03:12:21.843]  But anyways, side issue.
[03:12:22.183 --> 03:12:24.065]  You were asking me an important question about 9-11.
[03:12:25.606 --> 03:12:27.368]  After I do four hours, I start getting dingy, folks.
[03:12:29.773 --> 03:12:37.795]  The most important thing about 9-11 was the preparation and how I saw it coming and saw them building and doing the pre-preparation programming for it.
[03:12:38.475 --> 03:12:39.316]  That was the most important.
[03:12:39.336 --> 03:12:39.936]  I knew it was coming.
[03:12:40.036 --> 03:12:41.516]  Have you ever seen me predict 9-11?
[03:12:41.536 --> 03:12:42.697]  Have you ever seen that video?
[03:12:44.677 --> 03:12:45.237]  Morgan's gone?
[03:12:45.738 --> 03:12:46.378]  I didn't hang up on him.
[03:12:46.438 --> 03:12:47.038]  His phone cut out?
[03:12:48.318 --> 03:12:48.738]  Okay, fine.
[03:12:50.419 --> 03:12:57.381]  Regardless, see, if I have my own phone system in here, I will see the lights, but I know that is a $3,000 system for the one we need.
[03:12:58.257 --> 03:12:59.798]  That's one of the moderate price ones.
[03:12:59.978 --> 03:13:04.542]  See, I'll see them and I'd know and that won't keep happening where it's on a computer and they're gone and I'm going back to them.
[03:13:04.883 --> 03:13:05.683]  I will have it!
[03:13:07.425 --> 03:13:09.867]  I'm just... They're not the IT guys or something else.
[03:13:10.888 --> 03:13:14.271]  You guys want your bonuses, you're not gonna... I'm gonna have that phone system in here.
[03:13:16.072 --> 03:13:20.576]  I gotta bring a live camera in there and throw a fit on them to get my phone system.
[03:13:20.596 --> 03:13:23.198]  Because it's hard here when you can't control the calls yourself.
[03:13:23.498 --> 03:13:25.220]  You don't know when they're there, you get the calls wrong.
[03:13:27.006 --> 03:13:28.788]  Alright, side issue, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:13:29.668 --> 03:13:32.110]  Let me get back to being serious here and cover some news, take a few final calls.
[03:13:32.130 --> 03:13:33.892]  I'm going to go to Ian in England here in a moment.
[03:13:39.316 --> 03:13:42.479]  There is not one piece of information that's most important.
[03:13:42.819 --> 03:13:45.282]  Because I've really thought about this a lot.
[03:13:45.302 --> 03:13:49.265]  There's five or six pieces that all go together that are all monumental in size.
[03:13:50.086 --> 03:13:55.070]  But the fact that the government was running a drill, drills, CIA and Defense Department
[03:13:56.510 --> 03:13:56.930]  We're good to go.
[03:14:12.267 --> 03:14:13.107]  I mean, done deal.
[03:14:13.247 --> 03:14:14.127]  That's what they always do.
[03:14:14.167 --> 03:14:17.688]  There's always a drill in case somebody else in government who's compartmentalized catches them.
[03:14:18.028 --> 03:14:20.048]  And when you see them doing that, folks, it's over.
[03:14:20.068 --> 03:14:35.611]  I mean, the globalists are so arrogant to get their kicks that they, six months before with the X-Files Lone Gunman episode, the government hijacks a jet by remote control, a small group inside the Defense Department, to fly it into the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan to set up martial law.
[03:14:36.671 --> 03:14:39.472]  And they use a war game drill to make NORAD stand down.
[03:14:39.972 --> 03:14:41.632]  The exact scenario.
[03:14:44.110 --> 03:14:45.531]  The exact scenario.
[03:14:45.591 --> 03:14:47.873]  This is in your face, predictive programming.
[03:14:48.653 --> 03:14:49.554]  These people are sick.
[03:14:50.514 --> 03:14:56.658]  And then you get into the bombs in the buildings and the firefighters and police on record saying, get back, they're going to blow up Building 7 and on and on.
[03:14:56.678 --> 03:15:02.943]  And the buildings turn into pyroclastic flows of dust over miles and just, it goes on and on.
[03:15:02.963 --> 03:15:05.264]  And NORAD standing down, on and on.
[03:15:05.745 --> 03:15:11.829]  And 44,000 US troops, 18,000 British troops, BBC, Associated Press, Times of London, Reuters, AFP,
[03:15:12.649 --> 03:15:13.010]  We're good to go.
[03:15:32.447 --> 03:15:58.213]  uh... that the people in boot camp and called and uh... everybody else within minutes and so we've been hit by terrorist everything is different it's mass programming to get people to be freaked out in the event war of the world's and then when their defenses are down program now that the other these the the the the shy off people coming in don't even know what's going on they subconsciously know that's when you watch when back play that clip yes pull back up when he goes to the cia agent is in psychological warfare
[03:15:59.147 --> 03:15:59.767]  I looked him up.
[03:16:00.688 --> 03:16:06.132]  Beck is a psychopath, sociopath, sadistic little goblin creature who enjoys the evil.
[03:16:06.452 --> 03:16:11.536]  The CIA guy probably didn't know what he was getting into when he got recruited out of college and he's kind of freaked out as he's betraying America.
[03:16:11.896 --> 03:16:14.899]  Yeah, the 9-11 truthers are with Al-Qaeda.
[03:16:14.919 --> 03:16:16.280]  And you can see him kind of going...
[03:16:17.380 --> 03:16:19.081]  And you can see him gutting himself up to do it.
[03:16:19.122 --> 03:16:19.982]  You can look in his eyes.
[03:16:20.242 --> 03:16:21.823]  The body language is, I don't like doing this.
[03:16:21.883 --> 03:16:23.184]  God, I'm really a Nazi.
[03:16:23.525 --> 03:16:24.405]  I'm really a thug.
[03:16:24.465 --> 03:16:25.686]  I'm really anti-American.
[03:16:26.166 --> 03:16:28.148]  You know, I'm really destroying America.
[03:16:28.208 --> 03:16:28.948]  I'm really bad.
[03:16:29.589 --> 03:16:31.550]  I'm really joining the evil New World Order.
[03:16:31.590 --> 03:16:32.411]  Nazi isn't the right term.
[03:16:33.371 --> 03:16:33.972]  The globalist.
[03:16:34.692 --> 03:16:37.334]  He's really kind of getting it.
[03:16:37.374 --> 03:16:38.355]  You can see in the eyes.
[03:16:39.555 --> 03:16:40.016]  Beck is
[03:16:42.520 --> 03:16:44.142]  Just the petty power.
[03:16:44.802 --> 03:16:55.872]  They've done psychological tests with rats and chickens and pigeons where they have an implant that gives them an opiate rush normally electronically with a brain implant and they'll just sit there hitting the button for pleasure.
[03:16:56.806 --> 03:16:58.286]  The endorphin until they die.
[03:16:59.006 --> 03:17:01.447]  They'll be five days later, no water, no food.
[03:17:02.227 --> 03:17:08.248]  The pigeon will have its legs sticking out laying there like, uh, uh, uh, pleasure, uh, pleasure, pleasure.
[03:17:08.488 --> 03:17:09.608]  And that's Beck.
[03:17:09.648 --> 03:17:16.389]  He has no control, no higher emotions, no higher development for the planet, for his children, for his family, for humanity.
[03:17:16.549 --> 03:17:18.750]  He has no embarrassment about the exercise of power.
[03:17:18.990 --> 03:17:25.291]  I mean, when I'm doing good things and exercise power, when I defeat enemies who I have to crush because they've tried to destroy me and they're wicked,
[03:17:25.931 --> 03:17:31.154]  I feel sorry for them as they flop around broken, defeated, and crushed as I move past their smoking hulks.
[03:17:31.734 --> 03:17:36.676]  I don't like having to spend my time and energy even crushing enemies.
[03:17:37.337 --> 03:17:39.678]  Now, five, six years ago, I still liked them a little bit.
[03:17:39.718 --> 03:17:42.279]  Now, I'm hurt they've lost their humanity.
[03:17:42.359 --> 03:17:46.001]  I'm hurt they're not growing into what they could.
[03:17:46.021 --> 03:17:48.502]  I can't imagine what I'll grow into.
[03:17:49.262 --> 03:17:50.583]  Humanity, it's like growth.
[03:17:50.643 --> 03:17:52.964]  It's like loving the woods or loving the ocean.
[03:17:53.004 --> 03:17:53.865]  I love humanity.
[03:17:54.924 --> 03:17:58.887]  I understand we're just spoiled and childlike and the New World Order manipulates those instincts.
[03:17:59.828 --> 03:18:02.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, join us in this historic fight.

[03:18:03.131 --> 03:18:05.533]  The InfoWars.com Money Bomb going on.

[03:18:08.295 --> 03:18:09.757]  And I've been given an idea here.
[03:18:21.448 --> 03:18:24.010]  Yeah, the problem is I have major stories I've got to work on.
[03:18:24.030 --> 03:18:30.335]  I've got major breaking stuff here and sources I've got to track down for all these stories we break.
[03:18:31.863 --> 03:18:32.624]  That's another thing.
[03:18:32.644 --> 03:18:37.929]  I need money so I can have one or two people that just read the email and the tips, so it's not me.
[03:18:38.289 --> 03:18:43.895]  You know who half the time, when I get some document, they're making the VFW register all their guns to later hand them in.
[03:18:43.935 --> 03:18:49.360]  We called and confirmed what the caller said about, after we broke it, that they're saying, oh, this is for the BATF to come get them later.
[03:18:49.601 --> 03:18:50.962]  I called the VFW in Washington.
[03:18:50.982 --> 03:18:52.303]  They admitted that like it was no big deal.
[03:18:52.784 --> 03:18:54.686]  I've got to call these or I've got a homeland security.
[03:18:54.746 --> 03:18:55.667]  It's me calling.
[03:18:56.067 --> 03:19:00.009]  I need a few more reporters who can vet stuff and do stuff around here.
[03:19:00.369 --> 03:19:01.670]  I need a few more video editors.
[03:19:01.730 --> 03:19:02.950]  I need a few more webmasters.
[03:19:03.151 --> 03:19:04.191]  I need the capital!
[03:19:06.452 --> 03:19:13.556]  Right now, we've raised enough money for me to hire three good people.
[03:19:13.596 --> 03:19:16.797]  A video editor, a webmaster, a writer.
[03:19:20.519 --> 03:19:23.661]  See, to hire a couple video editors, a couple webmasters, a couple writers,
[03:19:24.631 --> 03:19:28.752]  I need $250,000 just for that.
[03:19:28.812 --> 03:19:29.312]  I don't have it.
[03:19:31.033 --> 03:19:32.413]  You know, you look right here on the screen.
[03:19:34.694 --> 03:19:35.074]  Let me see.
[03:19:35.514 --> 03:19:35.794]  Let's see.
[03:19:36.014 --> 03:19:37.135]  Let's say six people for $150,000.
[03:19:37.755 --> 03:19:39.375]  That's not getting paid much.
[03:19:40.175 --> 03:19:40.916]  Six, seven people.
[03:19:42.256 --> 03:19:42.856]  How much is that?
[03:19:43.896 --> 03:19:44.377]  Say 40, 40, 40, 40.
[03:19:44.777 --> 03:19:47.177]  Yeah, I know.
[03:19:47.217 --> 03:19:47.777]  I got like four.
[03:19:47.817 --> 03:19:49.498]  I got like four people, four or five people.
[03:19:51.260 --> 03:19:55.162]  And then I can't buy the equipment, I can't get the space, I can't do anything.
[03:19:55.542 --> 03:19:56.842]  I mean, I need the money to do this.
[03:19:57.323 --> 03:19:57.923]  That's up to you.
[03:19:59.704 --> 03:20:08.887]  For us to have a cushion so that we can defend ourselves from things and continue to operate, if everything shuts down in the economy, if everything's shut down, the dollar completely collapsed, people couldn't buy the books and videos anymore.
[03:20:10.568 --> 03:20:11.668]  Ah, three, four, five months.
[03:20:11.989 --> 03:20:12.829]  Maybe four months.
[03:20:13.409 --> 03:20:14.810]  Four months of operating capital.
[03:20:15.635 --> 03:20:21.096]  Is what I've got, and I keep that so we're not running on fumes, but that's, we're running on like a tenth of a tank.
[03:20:21.116 --> 03:20:24.497]  You know, it's kind of like, oh, it's time to go to the gas station, honey.
[03:20:24.897 --> 03:20:30.518]  And I go, well, I can hustle more and try to get more sponsors and bust my butt doing that, but I want to hustle making films.
[03:20:30.538 --> 03:20:31.918]  You know, hustle, hustle, get that out.
[03:20:31.938 --> 03:20:32.959]  You know, I can football.
[03:20:32.999 --> 03:20:34.219]  Hustle, hustle, guys, we've got to hustle.
[03:20:34.519 --> 03:20:35.319]  I can't do it all.
[03:20:36.579 --> 03:20:39.440]  I'm not bitching, I'm saying if you want to aid us, aid us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:40.325 --> 03:20:41.807]  Again, until 11am tomorrow, I want to raise $250,000.
[03:20:41.847 --> 03:20:41.887]  888-201-2244.
[03:20:47.244 --> 03:20:47.324]  888-201-2244.
[03:20:47.444 --> 03:20:52.428]  Their idea was for me to go answer phones and take donations.
[03:20:54.249 --> 03:20:56.171]  But I can't do that.
[03:20:56.811 --> 03:20:59.073]  Me trying to enter credit card numbers and stuff?
[03:20:59.093 --> 03:21:02.295]  I would totally screw that up.
[03:21:02.315 --> 03:21:04.777]  888-201-2244 or infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[03:21:05.038 --> 03:21:07.700]  And it sure makes the enemies and stalkers mad, too.
[03:21:07.780 --> 03:21:12.163]  So everybody who wasn't going to donate, go donate in there just to make the stalkers mad and the trolls.
[03:21:13.884 --> 03:21:26.586]  I need some stalker donations, and some troll donations, and some attack donations, and some false claim donations, and some fake legal stuff donations, because, you know, it's something else.
[03:21:28.067 --> 03:21:32.907]  It is sick, and I've almost completely gotten rid of the emotional thing of where I get attacked, I work even harder.
[03:21:33.227 --> 03:21:35.288]  I need to work for my family and the future of humanity.
[03:21:35.608 --> 03:21:41.489]  I don't want anything in me tainting why I do this for competitiveness, or for aggression, or any of that.
[03:21:42.714 --> 03:21:49.258]  Since I've turned loose of the remaining hate I had for people that attacked me, I feel better, I've been a lot nicer, and I've lost 30 pounds.
[03:21:49.799 --> 03:21:52.260]  Because before, I just couldn't even pull away to go exercise.
[03:21:52.300 --> 03:21:56.363]  I was too busy fighting a new allure and fighting my attackers and fighting this and fighting that.
[03:21:56.963 --> 03:21:59.025]  And I just realized, hey, it's all in God's hands.
[03:21:59.065 --> 03:22:00.326]  I'm doing the best job I can.
[03:22:00.346 --> 03:22:02.207]  I'm standing up and doing the right thing here.
[03:22:05.249 --> 03:22:06.430]  Let me run through a bunch of news.
[03:22:06.510 --> 03:22:08.211]  No, no, Ian in England's been holding too long.
[03:22:08.531 --> 03:22:10.152]  Ian in England, you're on the air.
[03:22:10.252 --> 03:22:10.612]  Welcome.
[03:22:10.652 --> 03:22:11.193]  Thank you, Ian.
[03:22:13.038 --> 03:22:16.300]  Hey, nice to speak to you, Alex.
[03:22:16.340 --> 03:22:17.481]  Nice of you to try to get on.
[03:22:17.521 --> 03:22:20.262]  Go ahead, I apologize if you haven't got a hold.
[03:22:20.282 --> 03:22:21.603]  That's okay, it's only been three hours.
[03:22:25.165 --> 03:22:28.207]  Now, I started off originally when Lew was on.
[03:22:29.228 --> 03:22:34.271]  That was when there was an awful lot of important things that the guy was saying.
[03:22:35.812 --> 03:22:41.495]  Just as a kickoff, you know, it would be good if Americans really paid attention to what
[03:22:42.435 --> 03:22:46.737]  What happened in Europe and how it came about, and what is happening now currently in Europe.
[03:22:47.718 --> 03:22:55.022]  Because, as you know, what happens here is definitely coming over to you guys in the near future.
[03:22:55.442 --> 03:22:56.282]  And vice versa.
[03:22:56.382 --> 03:22:56.883]  Sorry.
[03:22:58.643 --> 03:22:59.784]  And vice versa.
[03:22:59.804 --> 03:23:01.305]  You've got the floor for five minutes.
[03:23:01.665 --> 03:23:03.826]  Like you said, you held for three hours, so you go ahead.
[03:23:05.067 --> 03:23:05.627]  No, that's fine.
[03:23:06.007 --> 03:23:06.888]  I was saying that, you know, the
[03:23:08.625 --> 03:23:10.706]  As you say, it is a backwash.
[03:23:10.786 --> 03:23:16.527]  One thing goes one way, they're testing things in America, they come over here, we do things over here, and they go over there.
[03:23:16.687 --> 03:23:19.428]  So it's a reverse process.
[03:23:21.708 --> 03:23:34.191]  The only thing that worries me with what's happening in the US, and I'd like to get your feedback on this one, is with regards to... I mean, I know Ron Paul, and he's obviously a very credible character,
[03:23:34.895 --> 03:23:37.836]  But I wonder if it's the case of all the eggs in one basket.
[03:23:38.216 --> 03:23:44.598]  Because I've looked at, you know, Kucinich, and he is just as equally credible as Ron Paul.
[03:23:45.978 --> 03:23:56.241]  And it just seems that all the attention goes into just purely the, you know, obviously 1207, a fantastic thing that is being done by Ron Paul, and the auditing of the Fed.
[03:23:56.281 --> 03:23:57.862]  And I wish we had an equivalent here.
[03:23:59.037 --> 03:24:05.059]  That's right, your Bank of England, your private Bank of England is partners with our private Federal Reserve.
[03:24:05.079 --> 03:24:07.480]  That's kind of the evil dynamic duo.
[03:24:07.560 --> 03:24:08.781]  It's a central bank, isn't it?
[03:24:09.001 --> 03:24:09.601]  It's central.
[03:24:09.641 --> 03:24:17.244]  So when we have the Central Bank of Europe, so really the Bank of England is just a branch office of the European Bank now, to all effects.
[03:24:18.644 --> 03:24:20.345]  Now they're all interconnected.
[03:24:20.565 --> 03:24:23.286]  Of the overall IMF and the World Bank.
[03:24:23.386 --> 03:24:25.807]  I mean, they're all just branch offices, pretty much.
[03:24:28.311 --> 03:24:29.132]  That's the way I see it.
[03:24:29.152 --> 03:24:32.093]  I don't know, like I said, I'd like you to... I can tell you the architecture if you don't know it.
[03:24:32.373 --> 03:24:35.775]  It's the International Bank of Settlements is the grand board arbiter.
[03:24:36.135 --> 03:24:40.558]  And less than 20 families own the private central banks of the West.
[03:24:41.338 --> 03:24:41.499]  Yeah.
[03:24:42.099 --> 03:24:43.760]  So it all comes out of Switzerland pretty much.
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:47.322]  And I don't know if you've ever looked into, have you ever read Isaac Asimov?
[03:24:48.214 --> 03:24:49.555]  And the Foundation Series.
[03:24:49.795 --> 03:25:11.494]  Yes, I've read the entire Foundation Series, and you know, that was them throwing their real system in our face, where they have mathematical equations to predict the future, and that's what they're doing with the Google NSA biometric system is now marking reality, not just cyberspace, for a full net, full spectrum dominance grid.
[03:25:13.015 --> 03:25:15.557]  I mean, see, this is the thing that people don't get with the ID card.
[03:25:16.135 --> 03:25:20.523]  Because the ID cards, people say, oh well the ID cards, they're going to be introduced voluntarily.
[03:25:21.067 --> 03:25:25.268]  But the voluntary, there will be voluntary for the individuals who are working.
[03:25:25.628 --> 03:25:30.250]  But they will be compulsory for anybody taking any social benefits.
[03:25:30.610 --> 03:25:33.731]  Or buying gasoline, or buying gasoline, cigarettes, food.
[03:25:33.791 --> 03:25:38.792]  They're going to have a world sales tax that's going to be regional still, but will be world in implementation.
[03:25:38.832 --> 03:25:39.332]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:25:39.612 --> 03:25:39.872]  No, no, no.
[03:25:40.032 --> 03:25:41.273]  They need all that data.
[03:25:41.293 --> 03:25:45.814]  But I mean, you were going to say something about the Foundation Series, true visionary Isaac Asimov.
[03:25:46.294 --> 03:25:48.735]  Give me your take on it instead of me showing off that I knew about it.
[03:25:48.775 --> 03:25:49.015]  Go ahead.
[03:25:50.367 --> 03:25:58.915]  Well, the Isaac Asimov aspect of it is just, it's always this, you know, obviously these people are always shady.
[03:25:58.955 --> 03:26:00.677]  It's always the people you least expect.
[03:26:00.777 --> 03:26:05.562]  Now, when you talk to anybody about power, they never talk about Switzerland.
[03:26:06.102 --> 03:26:10.547]  They'll talk about Belgium, they'll talk about Britain, America.
[03:26:10.587 --> 03:26:14.871]  Switzerland always seems to be a blind spot.
[03:26:16.484 --> 03:26:17.865]  You're right, it needs to get more attention.
[03:26:17.945 --> 03:26:21.148]  It's the Vatican's bankers and the European Union.
[03:26:21.168 --> 03:26:22.670]  And then there's the second foundation.
[03:26:22.910 --> 03:26:23.591]  You see what I mean?
[03:26:23.631 --> 03:26:25.332]  That's the Isaac Asimov aspect of it.
[03:26:25.913 --> 03:26:31.078]  Because the foundation series is all about the people who never actually get recognized.
[03:26:32.419 --> 03:26:35.422]  And Switzerland is the foundation process.
[03:26:36.533 --> 03:26:38.573]  Because they've never been attacked.
[03:26:38.973 --> 03:26:40.154]  They've always been independent.
[03:26:40.194 --> 03:26:41.814]  They've always maintained their autonomy.
[03:26:42.954 --> 03:26:45.175]  Hold on, I just figured it out.
[03:26:45.215 --> 03:26:46.615]  My board ops want to go home.
[03:26:46.635 --> 03:26:48.415]  Are you guys shutting me down here?
[03:26:48.435 --> 03:26:49.655]  I hear the music coming in.
[03:26:49.675 --> 03:26:51.636]  No, no, no.
[03:26:52.336 --> 03:26:54.156]  I'm going to give us five more minutes on the clock.
[03:26:54.656 --> 03:26:56.196]  Sudden death overtime.
[03:26:56.236 --> 03:26:58.197]  We'll go out with that in a moment.
[03:26:58.217 --> 03:26:58.797]  Go ahead, caller.
[03:27:00.537 --> 03:27:00.937]  Okay.
[03:27:01.337 --> 03:27:01.978]  Well, the...
[03:27:05.336 --> 03:27:11.001]  There is always a blind spot that goes on with all of these things, and this is precisely where Switzerland seems to step into the mark.
[03:27:12.422 --> 03:27:19.789]  And that's the kind of frightening aspect, because it is the one entity, and as you said, the banking system, everything comes out of Switzerland.
[03:27:20.149 --> 03:27:21.470]  Listen, listen, I'm going to let you go.
[03:27:21.550 --> 03:27:23.392]  Call me back another day and you won't have to hold that long.
[03:27:23.412 --> 03:27:25.714]  I know you hung up and called back, that's why you were that long.
[03:27:25.734 --> 03:27:26.955]  But God bless you, Ian, good to hear from you.
[03:27:26.975 --> 03:27:30.758]  I'm going to take a few more, because Aaron and Nick and JT have been holding forever.
[03:27:30.778 --> 03:27:32.200]  I want to give them just like a minute and a half apiece.
[03:27:34.225 --> 03:27:38.509]  And we'll go out at like seven after that when we come back in the rebroadcast with a key part of the show from today.
[03:27:38.949 --> 03:27:44.394]  But not just Switzerland though, it's more than that.
[03:27:44.914 --> 03:27:48.117]  See, let me draw it like this.
[03:27:48.137 --> 03:27:49.658]  Can somebody zoom in on the camera right here?
[03:27:49.678 --> 03:27:50.619]  I'm going to draw this for people.
[03:27:51.300 --> 03:27:52.180]  Somebody zoom in on this.
[03:27:53.121 --> 03:27:54.122]  It kind of works like this.
[03:27:55.103 --> 03:27:58.446]  You look at the Swiss, you look at the British, you look at the Japanese, you look at Israel.
[03:27:59.850 --> 03:28:20.741]  You look at the Vatican, you look at the Russians, you look at the Chinese, you look at the Israeli Mafia, Wass Mafia, Italian Mafia, Chinese Mafia, Japanese Mafia, Global Corporations, Walmart, you know all these people, and it's all this group's bigger, that group's bigger, you know, the CFR's bigger, the Trilateral Commission's bigger.
[03:28:21.782 --> 03:28:28.986]  What they don't tell you is all of these, I just can't do it, there's too much light in here, that's why I've been asking, I really want to get a document cam,
[03:28:30.566 --> 03:28:31.287]  Up on the ceiling.
[03:28:31.307 --> 03:28:32.708]  And then we can do it that way.
[03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:37.632]  Maybe I can get like a board I can stand up to and then show people.
[03:28:38.272 --> 03:28:39.893]  I wanted that thing where I could draw on the screen.
[03:28:40.474 --> 03:28:41.354]  And then I could do this.
[03:28:41.455 --> 03:28:42.375]  I guess I haven't tried this.
[03:28:42.455 --> 03:28:50.522]  Anyways, you've got all these different groups when they're all interconnected and run by the same leadership.
[03:28:50.842 --> 03:28:55.465]  That's a very simple picture, but in reality they're all
[03:28:56.443 --> 03:29:03.207]  Interconnected, all intermarried, generational wealth, power, like for like, all connected to each other.
[03:29:03.507 --> 03:29:07.530]  And so the organism, the political makeup is right in front of you.
[03:29:07.550 --> 03:29:18.576]  People are saying, no, it's this group, or no, it's that group, and don't forget the Arabs, and other groups, or different think tanks, conservative, liberal groups.
[03:29:18.916 --> 03:29:22.919]  They'll say, oh, it's moveon.org runs it all, or no, it's CMP runs it all, or no, it's this or that.
[03:29:23.579 --> 03:29:24.760]  It's all these different groups.
[03:29:26.212 --> 03:29:27.413]  Or, oh, it's the Bohemian Grove.
[03:29:27.433 --> 03:29:34.459]  Well, all these groups come together at something like Bohemian Grove for 15 days, getting drunk and having sex and doing weird stuff.
[03:29:35.280 --> 03:29:37.742]  But all these things interconnect.
[03:29:39.384 --> 03:29:41.946]  And they even have occasional fights with each other.
[03:29:42.306 --> 03:29:45.009]  But then there's an equilibrium that comes back.
[03:29:46.252 --> 03:29:46.892]  Into it all.
[03:29:47.833 --> 03:29:52.956]  And there's a lot more connections to this, but it's like fractal logic or something.
[03:29:53.356 --> 03:29:58.259]  And so, everybody's looking in at one little piece instead of pulling back and going, oh, there's the group organism.
[03:29:59.640 --> 03:30:11.828]  And then you find out that it's always waging war against humanity that it sits on top of, and each of these little pyramid structures has nodes and sub-minions
[03:30:12.853 --> 03:30:18.555]  Run along the lines of an intelligence agency, growing roots down into the local community to control it.
[03:30:18.775 --> 03:30:37.101]  So this organism of corruption, this parasite, sits above humanity, and it's all interconnected above us in the administrative system, but then they have little spokes, again, growing down from them into the flesh of the body politic in humanity right there.
[03:30:39.141 --> 03:30:39.761]  Very simple.
[03:30:40.982 --> 03:30:43.845]  So again, everybody's focusing on this or that or this or that.
[03:30:43.985 --> 03:30:49.089]  They never want you to pull back and see the full organism of corruption and then realize how you've got to beat it.
[03:30:49.289 --> 03:30:51.771]  They want to transfer any power left in the nation states.
[03:30:52.691 --> 03:30:54.353]  Nation states are kind of like squares.
[03:30:56.383 --> 03:31:12.815]  See, and they have their own corruption, their own problems, but they're being fully removed, because when these groups fully remove the old power structures, they get to set the new rules for a totally centralized power structure, where they're not only steering the planet, but dominating and micromanaging through a high-tech control grid.
[03:31:15.837 --> 03:31:17.678]  Aaron in Kentucky, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:31:18.979 --> 03:31:23.863]  Yeah, hey, I guess I've been listening for a while, and probably one thing that I've had difficulty running my
[03:31:24.713 --> 03:31:26.034]  God, how do I do this call in one minute?
[03:31:26.054 --> 03:31:28.255]  Looks like we're going longer, man.
[03:31:29.255 --> 03:31:33.878]  Look, what do I say to you, briefly?
[03:31:51.923 --> 03:31:59.905]  You know, if I had time, I would pull up medical graphs in Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, England, and the graphs all look almost identical.
[03:32:00.305 --> 03:32:04.427]  You'll have a graph, and it'll say 1900, and it'll say 1930, 1950,
[03:32:13.391 --> 03:32:21.213]  And with sanitation in the Western world, with sanitation coming in around 1900, infectious diseases go like this.
[03:32:21.673 --> 03:32:21.873]  Look.
[03:32:25.794 --> 03:32:25.994]  Here's 1900.
[03:32:26.074 --> 03:32:29.174]  Infectious diseases plunge because of sanitation.
[03:32:29.574 --> 03:32:29.795]  There to 1930.
[03:32:29.915 --> 03:32:40.797]  And then, vaccination starts right around the same time, and you actually see the diseases go back up somewhat, but not as bad as it was before there was sewage running through the streets, and
[03:32:45.570 --> 03:32:45.650]  Yeah.
[03:32:45.730 --> 03:32:47.511]  Oh, it's got Lou Rockwell's phone number on it.
[03:32:47.551 --> 03:32:49.533]  I can't show that piece of paper.
[03:32:50.353 --> 03:32:53.255]  I bet we can get our heads around it and get me that drawing pad for the screen.
[03:32:53.295 --> 03:32:54.576]  I bet we can get a document cam.
[03:32:54.616 --> 03:32:55.316]  I bet we could do that.
[03:32:55.336 --> 03:32:57.017]  Because I don't want the little easel over here.
[03:32:57.037 --> 03:32:57.778]  I don't like that.
[03:32:57.838 --> 03:32:59.079]  You don't understand, folks.
[03:32:59.099 --> 03:32:59.859]  I've been asking for this.
[03:33:00.600 --> 03:33:02.161]  Anyway, here it is.
[03:33:02.781 --> 03:33:03.922]  Now, can we zoom in, please?
[03:33:05.063 --> 03:33:07.204]  I want to show people at PrisonPlanet.tv what I'm talking about.
[03:33:10.996 --> 03:33:12.396]  I'm sure you probably do like a whole episode.
[03:33:12.416 --> 03:33:14.157]  They insist on doing it this way, you know.
[03:33:14.497 --> 03:33:31.180]  Anyways, 1900, right there, infectious diseases plunge before vaccines even become widespread because of sanitation, washing hands, better surgical procedures, sewage not running down the street, people not dumping their feces out of their top window in the middle of the street with all the horse crap and pig crap.
[03:33:31.900 --> 03:33:40.622]  Okay, now vaccines get popular in the 30s and 40s and 50s and the disease rate actually goes up and the graph is almost identical in every western nation.
[03:33:44.659 --> 03:33:45.500]  Okay, do you see that?
[03:33:46.020 --> 03:34:01.890]  Now, I'm not saying vaccines couldn't be good in and of themselves, and in some cases it's been proven you can get by stunning something, damaging it, attenuating it, you can get some increases.
[03:34:01.930 --> 03:34:07.793]  But here's an example, they want to give people, I've seen these studies, all these shots, you don't get the thousands of different variants of warts.
[03:34:08.113 --> 03:34:13.457]  But then all these major university medical center studies have come out, where if you have those warts,
[03:34:14.755 --> 03:34:21.240]  Which most people have the virus for, that you're something like 90% less likely to die of a whole range of cancers.
[03:34:21.880 --> 03:34:24.182]  You said you're meant to get the chickenpox.
[03:34:24.542 --> 03:34:26.044]  You're meant to get the smallpox.
[03:34:26.284 --> 03:34:27.865]  You're meant to get the whooping cough.
[03:34:29.066 --> 03:34:35.110]  People used to die because of bad nutrition and bad heating and bad sanitation.
[03:34:36.013 --> 03:34:39.116]  Okay, and then naturally, the stronger went on and lived.
[03:34:39.216 --> 03:34:43.660]  But you go to an old cemetery, half the people dead in there are kids under 10, most of them babies.
[03:34:44.060 --> 03:34:47.704]  And I'm not saying that's a good thing, but it was sanitation that did that, not vaccines.
[03:34:47.744 --> 03:34:49.946]  Now, that aside, vaccines could have some good.
[03:34:50.286 --> 03:34:53.869]  You can't trust the eugenicists that put the vaccines out.
[03:34:55.090 --> 03:35:00.074]  They'll give an African kid a tetanus shot so they don't die of tetanus, but in that is a female hormone bound to it.
[03:35:00.114 --> 03:35:02.696]  This is mainstream news, to then sterilize them.
[03:35:03.196 --> 03:35:07.780]  So, they never have kids, and it's a painful sterilization, because they're not actually sterilized.
[03:35:08.260 --> 03:35:17.206]  At the second trimester, a hormone clicks in, the body's already attacked the gland that issues that, and secretes it, and so they have violent miscarriage after miscarriage, and then they brag.
[03:35:17.507 --> 03:35:21.890]  That then, generally after three or four pregnancies, results in a soft kill with the mother dying.
[03:35:23.473 --> 03:35:29.755]  But it's also a killer shot that kills them via the second term reproductive problems it causes.
[03:35:30.575 --> 03:35:30.995]  You understand?
[03:35:31.035 --> 03:35:33.496]  I mean, this is a government that's caught giving black men and letting them die of syphilis.
[03:35:33.516 --> 03:35:35.577]  A government caught radiating foster children.
[03:35:35.777 --> 03:35:42.318]  A government caught giving Indians in army manuals that they got from the British how to give smallpox blankets to Indians.
[03:35:42.378 --> 03:35:49.481]  You're going to trust them to take shots when every movie and science fiction movie and, you know, the day the world stopped or whatever it's called with Keanu Reeves.
[03:35:51.852 --> 03:35:54.474]  You know, all that stuff about how humans are bad, we all gotta die.
[03:35:54.794 --> 03:35:56.015]  I mean, you're going to trust Eugenicist?
[03:35:56.055 --> 03:36:01.398]  Have you seen all the headlines where world leaders call, you know, in secret meeting of the rich to curb population?
[03:36:02.619 --> 03:36:04.260]  I mean, you're going to trust them and take the shots?
[03:36:08.843 --> 03:36:09.783]  Aaron, did that answer your question?
[03:36:10.224 --> 03:36:11.885]  Oh, yeah, I didn't think I was on the air anymore.
[03:36:12.225 --> 03:36:12.685]  Yes, you are.
[03:36:12.705 --> 03:36:13.165]  Oh, yeah, I guess.
[03:36:13.846 --> 03:36:20.230]  Oh, okay, um... Yeah, I guess I kind of... I mean, I'm sure that's a lot of information to process, and I probably have to look up a lot of that, you know, on my own.
[03:36:21.015 --> 03:36:21.416]  God bless you, sir.
[03:36:21.436 --> 03:36:27.083]  You know, I should do a whole two-hour show just on vaccines alone, but we always show the numbers and the statistics.
[03:36:27.103 --> 03:36:28.185]  Okay, search engine this for him right now.
[03:36:39.949 --> 03:36:41.490]  Gardasil dead girls.
[03:36:41.550 --> 03:36:42.751]  Gardasil kills girls.
[03:36:43.131 --> 03:36:47.574]  I mean, and the first thing that comes up is the articles when they were dying during the trials.
[03:36:47.954 --> 03:36:50.176]  Just a few thousand took it and a bunch died.
[03:36:50.936 --> 03:36:52.798]  And I got on there and I said, it's killing people.
[03:36:53.078 --> 03:37:01.864]  And I said, Merck is having state governors say this is mandatory so federal funds kick in when it's recommended.
[03:37:01.884 --> 03:37:03.665]  They call it mandatory through health departments.
[03:37:03.945 --> 03:37:06.167]  So when there's damage, the feds pay for the lawsuits.
[03:37:06.527 --> 03:37:08.268]  They knew they had a bad drug that was killing people.
[03:37:08.448 --> 03:37:09.529]  They dumped it on the market.
[03:37:10.289 --> 03:37:15.015]  To carry out eugenics and get paid, just like factor VIII blood.
[03:37:16.677 --> 03:37:20.501]  HPV vaccine Gardasil kills three, disrupts 18 pregnancies and trials.
[03:37:20.942 --> 03:37:21.643]  Wired Magazine.
[03:37:23.336 --> 03:37:23.956]  Yeah Alex, how's it going?
[03:37:53.507 --> 03:37:57.988]  Yeah, I just wanted to call and let you know I had a little solution on how to get your information out.
[03:37:58.309 --> 03:38:03.110]  Thinking about getting some business cards and putting websites of yours out.
[03:38:03.910 --> 03:38:05.931]  I do go out of line and try to inform people.
[03:38:06.291 --> 03:38:07.232]  Very effective.
[03:38:07.252 --> 03:38:08.832]  A lot of folks have been doing that for decades.
[03:38:09.032 --> 03:38:10.032]  Very tried and true.
[03:38:10.413 --> 03:38:13.814]  Good, low tech, effective, way to get it done.
[03:38:14.654 --> 03:38:16.375]  So that's in my process right now.
[03:38:16.395 --> 03:38:20.156]  Today I did donate to the Money Bomb and I got six of your DVDs.
[03:38:21.075 --> 03:38:26.086]  So once I get those in, I'm going to make copies and get them out to everybody.
[03:38:26.147 --> 03:38:29.635]  I just want to say good luck to the Money Bomb and God bless you.
[03:38:30.123 --> 03:38:31.604]  God bless you and thanks for holding, Nick.
[03:38:32.405 --> 03:38:33.445]  And we're not going to let you down.
[03:38:33.886 --> 03:38:43.512]  I'm trying to be the most moral person, work the hardest I can, watch what I do, watch what I say, because I realize the leadership position I'm in, and quite frankly, I look at how I act and what I do, and I'm embarrassed.
[03:38:44.173 --> 03:38:45.113]  Because I'm not perfect.
[03:38:45.233 --> 03:38:46.534]  I never wanted to be in this position.
[03:38:46.895 --> 03:38:51.538]  Last night I told my wife at dinner, I said, I can't believe I'm the tip of the spear in this thing.
[03:38:52.298 --> 03:38:53.419]  And I go, I don't know if I'm up to this.
[03:38:53.439 --> 03:38:54.600]  She said, yeah, you're up to it.
[03:38:54.640 --> 03:38:55.420]  You have to be up to it.
[03:38:55.941 --> 03:38:56.481]  And she's right.
[03:38:58.103 --> 03:38:59.545]  This isn't a power trip here, folks.
[03:38:59.565 --> 03:39:01.328]  This isn't some, you know, mind trip.
[03:39:01.348 --> 03:39:08.440]  This has really helped me grow as a spiritual being, and I just want to not let anybody down.
[03:39:09.041 --> 03:39:10.182]  And God knows I do it every day.
[03:39:11.650 --> 03:39:14.572]  But I'm doing the best I can, and that's all I can ask any of you.
[03:39:14.892 --> 03:39:17.634]  So thank you for the support, Nick of The Money Bomb.
[03:39:17.674 --> 03:39:19.535]  And last time, I'll plug this, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[03:39:19.575 --> 03:39:25.159]  People will be here until 1 o'clock tonight.
[03:39:25.179 --> 03:39:30.522]  I'll be live tonight, 9 to midnight, with Jason Burma steering the second annual 2009 Money Bomb.
[03:39:31.183 --> 03:39:33.784]  The website is InfowarsMoneyBomb.com or Infowars.com.
[03:39:33.804 --> 03:39:36.486]  The biggest thing you can do is tell people about The Money Bomb who are listening.
[03:39:36.546 --> 03:39:37.607]  Remind them what's going on.
[03:39:37.867 --> 03:39:38.968]  Tell them to give today or tomorrow.
[03:39:40.329 --> 03:39:43.952]  Let's go ahead and talk to JT in Colorado, and that'll be it.
[03:39:44.092 --> 03:39:44.533]  JT.
[03:39:45.233 --> 03:39:45.814]  Hey Alex.
[03:39:46.114 --> 03:39:47.435]  Hey, it's JT Coyote!
[03:39:48.836 --> 03:39:49.577]  That would be me.
[03:39:50.057 --> 03:39:58.724]  Hey, I tell ya, I haven't turned the coffee pot off in 48 hours, but it has been fun on the blogs and on the forum.
[03:39:59.144 --> 03:40:00.765]  So they are after me.
[03:40:01.866 --> 03:40:05.029]  Have you gotten the other volunteer moderators to help?
[03:40:05.734 --> 03:40:18.099]  Well, what I did was I went over and I rounded up a posse from the Prison Planet Forum, and I want to say thank you to all you guys.
[03:40:18.499 --> 03:40:27.523]  They took their well-reasoned arguments over to InfoWars, and they have been just, well, you know, how can you argue with the truth?
[03:40:28.343 --> 03:40:29.824]  And we swept out the first
[03:40:35.563 --> 03:40:47.551]  Yeah, it started 24 hours before everything happened, and that thing had probably close to 600 posts on it.
[03:40:48.411 --> 03:40:55.456]  And now the latest Money Bomb thread, it's pushing 300, and the posse's still working.
[03:40:55.476 --> 03:40:57.837]  The Prison Planet Forum posse.
[03:40:58.618 --> 03:40:59.198]  It's amazing.
[03:40:59.502 --> 03:41:04.206]  Well God bless you guys and maybe if I get some money for the money bomb I can pay the moderators a little bit or something.
[03:41:04.226 --> 03:41:05.287]  The problem is we just don't have the funds.
[03:41:05.307 --> 03:41:06.188]  That would be a nice gesture.
[03:41:10.928 --> 03:41:14.269]  Or at least a little bonus or something for the overtime, because it's either that or get rid of it.
[03:41:14.569 --> 03:41:28.394]  Because, you know, it's in the news, the Secret Service is here, I'm being subpoenaed, because these idiots go threaten on purpose, and when they go to their houses, in one case the Secret Service admitted, the guy did it to try to get me in trouble, and didn't realize he was the one that was going to get in trouble.
[03:41:29.434 --> 03:41:32.115]  See, and this needs to get out.
[03:41:32.755 --> 03:41:37.937]  The thing is, you know, right there on InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.com,
[03:41:39.163 --> 03:41:42.026]  That isn't the tip of the spear for the info, or you're that.
[03:41:42.666 --> 03:41:48.330]  But what that is, is the dozer blade on the front of the bulldozer that's heading toward the New World Order.
[03:41:48.871 --> 03:42:00.860]  And it gives us a battlefield where all the training that the guys are getting, and all of the information we have up on the Prison Planet Forum, I mean, that is an enormous truth library.
[03:42:01.727 --> 03:42:07.412]  No it is, and you know I should support the Prison Planet Forum more and promote it.
[03:42:07.992 --> 03:42:10.695]  There's links to it, incredible articles, incredible research.
[03:42:10.715 --> 03:42:16.560]  Kurt, I don't have the time, Kurt tries to read through and post the best articles from that on InfoWars, on Prison Planet.
[03:42:16.880 --> 03:42:18.681]  Maybe we should create a moderator.
[03:42:19.887 --> 03:42:21.248]  Well, they absolutely don't want that.
[03:42:21.268 --> 03:42:24.110]  They know if this thing goes over the top, that we will defeat them.
[03:42:48.783 --> 03:42:51.546]  And it's going over the top.
[03:42:51.646 --> 03:42:54.968]  I'm with John Harmon.
[03:42:54.988 --> 03:42:58.772]  I think you may raise a million dollars, Alex.
[03:42:59.572 --> 03:43:00.113]  I don't know.
[03:43:00.914 --> 03:43:12.864]  And the people who have trepidation about giving to a money bomb, they can always get one of these fine, in-the-fed t-shirts that I'm wearing.
[03:43:13.838 --> 03:43:20.946]  Uh, or, and I love that 1770s, or uh, the answer to 1984 is 1776 t-shirt.
[03:43:21.687 --> 03:43:23.589]  Absolutely, that's a point I haven't made enough of.
[03:43:23.609 --> 03:43:31.957]  People can support us by buying the books and videos and t-shirts and know they're getting something, and make copies of the films, get them out to people, put it on AXS TV, that's what I'm all about.
[03:43:32.238 --> 03:43:32.578]  J.T.
[03:43:32.618 --> 03:43:35.281]  Coyote, God bless you, we'll talk to you probably tonight or something.
[03:43:35.580 --> 03:43:36.060]  All right, buddy.
[03:43:36.721 --> 03:43:37.221]  Take care.
[03:43:37.481 --> 03:43:45.285]  I have got to go work on some news stories and see what's going on with the money bomb, and I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, here at Genesis and at PrisonPlanet.tv with Burmese.
[03:43:46.476 --> 03:43:47.857]  I want to thank everybody that is supporting us.
[03:43:48.097 --> 03:43:52.759]  Lou Rockwell is coming up in about 10 minutes and on the show and the retransmission.
[03:43:52.779 --> 03:43:53.579]  That was a great interview.
[03:43:53.780 --> 03:43:55.540]  And then Cindy Sheehan and others.
[03:43:56.681 --> 03:44:04.145]  Please call now 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244 or Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[03:44:04.205 --> 03:44:05.325]  Don't wait, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:44:05.685 --> 03:44:08.067]  I want to get up to $250,000 by midnight tonight.
[03:44:08.487 --> 03:44:11.168]  So tell your email list, tell everybody about it, spread the videos.
[03:44:11.188 --> 03:44:12.889]  I'm going to put my plea out to everybody.
[03:44:13.289 --> 03:44:14.109]  God bless you all.
[03:44:14.189 --> 03:44:14.870]  You are the best.
[03:44:15.290 --> 03:44:17.016]  We'll see you back live tonight, 9 to midnight.
[03:44:17.076 --> 03:44:19.063]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:44:20.247 --> 03:44:20.930]  Great job, crew.
