[00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:10.242]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:11.703]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:13.385]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:17.709]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.274]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:27.029]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.569]  Welcome.
[00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.572]  We are now into hour number three already today.
[00:00:31.592 --> 00:00:35.794]  We'll be live, simulcasting the radio show for the next two hours.
[00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:38.376]  The radio show is live, 11 a.m.
[00:00:38.396 --> 00:00:38.896]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:39.636]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:40.057 --> 00:00:43.399]  And then in the second and third hour every day, we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:44.699]  Some days we do three or four hours.
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.943]  Sometimes the whole show is live and we have a lot of guests that are on that want to take part in the TV show.
[00:00:50.703 --> 00:01:02.288]  We just talked earlier to Attorney Eric Plumlee about your cable boxes, your cell phones, all tracking, tracing everything you go, everywhere you go, what you do, tuning in, listening to you, tracking your every move.
[00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:08.491]  Ray McGovern, Chief CIA Briefer to Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:13.253]  will be joining us to talk about a host of geopolitical issues, including what's happening right now in Gaza.
[00:01:13.593 --> 00:01:19.816]  The Israelis have now been invading some of the three major cities, including areas, suburbs of Gaza City,
[00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:26.438]  We're a million five hundred thousand people are under siege and dead and dying.
[00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:30.359]  So we will continue to cover that humanitarian disaster.
[00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.701]  And then in studio coming up in one hour, we will have former
[00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:41.925]  Police narcotics investigator Barry Cooper in here exposing the police state and how the police violate the law.
[00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:47.048]  He's been running stings against police around the country and making international headlines with that.
[00:01:47.068 --> 00:01:48.629]  His website is NeverGetBusted.com.
[00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.052]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:56.815]  But first, when we get back in the next segment,
[00:01:57.694 --> 00:02:10.664]  I'm going to get into what happened with the shooting in California last Friday on New Year's Day of the African-American man who was killed execution-style by the police.
[00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:13.506]  Now, I waited a few days to comment on this.
[00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:14.406]  People were wanting me to comment.
[00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.307]  I had to study the case.
[00:02:15.888 --> 00:02:17.449]  Now we know what happened, pretty much.
[00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:23.293]  And it is a police cover-up and police deception, and we're going to be going over that coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:25.254]  But before I get to that, look at this!
[00:02:26.232 --> 00:02:26.572]  Right here.
[00:02:27.992 --> 00:02:46.016]  Last night, I noticed that the Horizon Milk that we had at our house, who previously had a message about how they don't have bovine growth hormone or other hormones or antibiotics used on their cattle, which are then transferred to human beings, I noticed that it changed.
[00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:53.558]  It said, our farms produce this milk without antibiotics, added hormones, pesticides, or cloning.
[00:02:54.378 --> 00:02:55.178]  Cloning, right there!
[00:02:56.198 --> 00:03:06.801]  And for those that aren't watching at PrisonPlanet.TV, it's a classic red and white paper half-gallon of milk.
[00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:13.143]  And it's the popular brand of organic milk that I first saw appear about eight years ago.
[00:03:13.163 --> 00:03:17.104]  I've been using it that long and one of the most popular brands nationwide.
[00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:27.498]  And there is the USDA organic seal that they have, and it says, our farms produce this milk without antibiotics, added hormones, pesticides or cloning.
[00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:34.086]  And I raise this point here because every time I talk about how there are giant dairy
[00:03:35.106 --> 00:04:02.308]  Herds especially, that are from cloned animals, or the offspring of cloned animals, these genetic freaks with hormones to produce triple the amount of milk, and then they're genetic freaks that produce even more, that in the cloning process, a lot of other changes happen to the animal, and these are cross-species animals, they've added insect, plant, genes, other things into their DNA, that that has a lot of spin-off effects and alters the viral
[00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:11.116]  Blooms, bacterial activity in the animals, and also has some connections to cancer.
[00:04:11.597 --> 00:04:25.690]  Many GMO foods, of course, in studies show cause cancer because it creates new, well it's a whole host of things, ring structures, new types of amino acids that never existed before.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.924]  In cases they'll feed GMO potatoes to rats and most of the rats die or they're sterile.
[00:04:32.944 --> 00:04:34.185]  I mean the same thing over and over again.
[00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:41.130]  Well now it's not just soybeans or potatoes or corn, it's the very animals we're eating or the milk from those animals that we're drinking.
[00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:49.935]  But the public can't even address this or deal with it because they send me emails saying I'm crazy, we're not eating cloned cows, we're not drinking milk from cloned cows.
[00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:50.916]  Yes we are.
[00:04:51.436 --> 00:04:56.180]  To the point of the milk companies that are organic have to tell you that there's no cloning.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.660]  Comprende?
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.060]  So there you have it.
[00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:01.381]  We are living in a Buck Rogers age.
[00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:04.742]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:05:05.182 --> 00:05:08.483]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:05:08.963 --> 00:05:14.904]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:05:15.284 --> 00:05:19.425]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:05:19.905 --> 00:05:24.306]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces
[00:05:24.326 --> 00:05:25.626]  This is electricity for free.
[00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:28.987]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:05:29.327 --> 00:05:33.748]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:05:33.988 --> 00:05:39.929]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:44.830]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with the solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.091]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:05:52.492 --> 00:05:53.473]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:53.493 --> 00:05:55.033]  A new world order.
[00:05:55.053 --> 00:06:00.076]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:00.236 --> 00:06:04.938]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:05.018 --> 00:06:09.200]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.082]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:20.021 --> 00:06:27.355]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:35.339]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.221]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:00.315]  Be warned.
[00:07:01.636 --> 00:07:07.181]  IonicZone.com has the best prices on commercial shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:15.026]  But did you know IonicZone.com also sells a water ozonator that's a must-have for anyone interested in good health?
[00:07:15.427 --> 00:07:15.867]  It's true.
[00:07:16.127 --> 00:07:24.914]  The IonicZone digital water ozonator features an air intake and can be fed dry air through the supplied air dryer or pure oxygen via an oxygen tank.
[00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:34.780]  Ozone fortified water can be used to kill bacteria, sanitize food, produce, and eliminates bacteria in the mouth by gargling, which helps prevent bad breath and even heart disease.
[00:07:35.141 --> 00:07:41.745]  The optional ozone bidet attachment is used for personal hygiene, which can kill the bacteria down below that can lead to irritation.
[00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:44.987]  It's amazing what three atoms of oxygen can do!

[00:08:06.424 --> 00:08:07.084]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:08.786]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.506 --> 00:08:10.627]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:11.268 --> 00:08:12.089]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:14.331]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:18.034]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.594 --> 00:08:22.638]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:28.489]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:31.995]  Ray McGovern coming up in about 22 minutes from now.
[00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:39.848]  Living here in Austin, Texas, we have had
[00:08:41.089 --> 00:09:01.083]  Four cases I can remember in the last few years of police shooting someone who's handcuffed or someone who is unarmed on the ground or, well there are actually more than four cases, several cases of mentally retarded homeless people or one guy was out of a mental institution and ran from the police so they gunned him down.
[00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:07.928]  And there's other cases that are questionable where you'll have a mentally ill person waving a stick at police so they just shoot him 20 feet away.
[00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:09.570]  Very cowardly behavior.
[00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.831]  And I'm not here to bash the police in whole.
[00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:23.974]  But when you have police going from being peace officers, culturally, to being paramilitary forces that are militarily trained, and even trained with the military, it's an us against them.
[00:09:24.174 --> 00:09:37.097]  It's no longer a guardian position, and they still have that remnants of that, vestigial elements of that, to a certain point, but they're transferring more and more over to this continuum of force
[00:09:38.792 --> 00:10:03.066]  uh... system where they've got to be in control of the situation and if somebody gets out of control in any way uh... they they use maximum force uh... against these individuals with a zero tolerance policy in the name of their safety and i've seen the statistics and numbers it hasn't made police safer in fact police if you're so scared of everything you should know the number one cause of death for you is automobile accidents and uh...
[00:10:03.826 --> 00:10:08.049]  That's car wrecks, but then within that group it's also hanging your butts out on the highway writing tickets.
[00:10:08.089 --> 00:10:10.972]  And you guys and gals have got some courage.
[00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:12.813]  I mean, I know what's dangerous.
[00:10:13.794 --> 00:10:19.839]  That's why when I get pulled over, I pull over in the grass hoping he won't or she won't be sticking their butt out in the middle of the highway here.
[00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:23.221]  Cops get killed every day in this country getting run over.
[00:10:23.642 --> 00:10:27.625]  So you're all freaking out and scared and pulling guns out on us for almost no reason.
[00:10:27.985 --> 00:10:30.087]  Like you're in a war zone.
[00:10:30.107 --> 00:10:32.348]  I mean, I see police coming up.
[00:10:33.217 --> 00:10:38.104]  When they pull somebody over with their hand on their gun to an old lady driving a convertible.
[00:10:38.184 --> 00:10:49.361]  I mean, I've had a cop pull me over before and I had a weight belt in the front seat and he pulled his gun out and stuck it to my head and then freaked out and luckily didn't blow up even more when he was wrong.
[00:10:52.304 --> 00:10:54.484]  He said, okay, sorry, just don't speed, get out of here.
[00:10:54.524 --> 00:11:00.345]  But needless to say, I had sweat running down my brow from five seconds of him with that gun.
[00:11:00.365 --> 00:11:03.866]  And he said, I thought it was a big knife scabbard or gun belt.
[00:11:03.946 --> 00:11:05.786]  I'm just like, no, it's a weight belt.
[00:11:07.707 --> 00:11:08.247]  It's right there.
[00:11:09.747 --> 00:11:20.329]  But if he would have put a hole in my head, they tell police in the academy, wink, wink, when they're in the locker room, and I've talked to a lot of police who have told me this, and it's come out in court cases, to carry a throwaway gun.
[00:11:21.374 --> 00:11:21.994]  You know, a stinger.
[00:11:22.754 --> 00:11:32.536]  To carry a little derringer or something they can throw at the scene that they got at a gun show or something, so there's no record of it, you know, through a private sale so they can set you up.
[00:11:32.836 --> 00:11:40.038]  And they say, well, we've got to do that because it's tough out there and we're going to make mistakes and, you know, we've got to do this to protect our officers and it's just something we do.
[00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:50.220]  See, that's how the culture of corruption begins, where they incrementally, you know, do these things in the name of the greater good, but it's not.
[00:11:53.188 --> 00:11:54.929]  And I'm not here to even bash the police.
[00:11:54.989 --> 00:12:00.892]  I understand they're being federalized, they're being brainwashed, they're being slowly twisted into accepting tyranny and corruption.
[00:12:02.033 --> 00:12:05.154]  But I am here to point out that we have the Justice Department's own numbers.
[00:12:05.214 --> 00:12:09.296]  Police shootings are going way up nationwide of citizens.
[00:12:09.356 --> 00:12:12.178]  And more and more of those are questionable or outright executions.
[00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:16.480]  Remember a few years ago the famous case of the off-duty cop.
[00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:27.383]  and the cop pulls him over says get out of the car and pulls his gun out on the guys begging saying please please please don't shoot me I'm not a threat and they shoot him.
[00:12:28.297 --> 00:12:28.918]  Several times.
[00:12:29.518 --> 00:12:30.239]  Was it three times?
[00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:32.721]  And then there's the famous case of the NFL football player.
[00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:33.922]  Cops are yelling at him.
[00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.043]  He's going, what's wrong?
[00:12:35.643 --> 00:12:36.484]  He's totally calm.
[00:12:36.504 --> 00:12:38.986]  He's going, officer, officer, everything's okay.
[00:12:39.046 --> 00:12:40.547]  And he goes, don't you make a fist at me.
[00:12:40.868 --> 00:12:42.729]  He goes, I'm not making a fist, sir.
[00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:44.471]  And he pulls his hands back and goes like this.
[00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:45.551]  He goes, you're making a fist again.
[00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:46.993]  So the cops start shoving him.
[00:12:47.173 --> 00:12:48.514]  And he goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, man.
[00:12:48.754 --> 00:12:49.575]  So they taser him.
[00:12:50.731 --> 00:12:53.094]  And clearly, he's supplicating.
[00:12:53.395 --> 00:12:54.957]  He's okay.
[00:12:54.977 --> 00:13:01.425]  This is international sign with their hands out, open palms facing that, hey, no problem.
[00:13:01.445 --> 00:13:03.087]  That's the natural hands up.
[00:13:03.147 --> 00:13:05.591]  This is not the natural hands up.
[00:13:05.611 --> 00:13:07.854]  The natural hands up is, whoa, whoa, whoa, let's, you know, okay.
[00:13:09.654 --> 00:13:13.856]  So, last Friday, everybody's like, another police shooting in California.
[00:13:14.096 --> 00:13:16.977]  And we have video of the BART cop execution.
[00:13:17.017 --> 00:13:19.218]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:19.258 --> 00:13:24.440]  Now, another video has come out, shot further down the platform.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:36.525]  The first video that came out, Monday night, was another train pulling in, as you see the young males sitting on
[00:13:37.557 --> 00:13:50.906]  Their hind ends up against a wall and they've got their hands in their lap and the police are yelling and screaming and freaking out and you can see that the young men are calm and they're submitting.
[00:13:50.966 --> 00:13:53.187]  They don't have their hands out extended.
[00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:55.028]  They're going, okay, okay, okay.
[00:13:55.048 --> 00:13:58.170]  And the police are clearly saying, get up, turn around, I'll put you in cuffs.
[00:13:58.631 --> 00:13:59.992]  So one of the guys starts getting up.
[00:14:00.032 --> 00:14:01.853]  He puts his hands behind his back.
[00:14:03.527 --> 00:14:07.210]  And the police decide to go ahead and slam his head down on the ground and jump on his neck.
[00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:11.252]  A lot of people's necks get broken by this, and the cops just make excuses.
[00:14:11.452 --> 00:14:21.359]  So they jump on his neck, they're all piling on him, and they start going for the other guy, and witnesses reported that he said, hey don't hurt me, I've got a young daughter, I'm submitting, I'm cool.
[00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:25.542]  And you can see his face, he's going, come on, come on, everything's alright, he's got his hands out.
[00:14:25.842 --> 00:14:28.364]  Like, in the international symbol of, okay, okay.
[00:14:29.224 --> 00:14:34.070]  And they grab him, and they slam him down like the other guy, and he's not resisting.
[00:14:34.391 --> 00:14:40.018]  He's just laying there, and the cop pulls his gun out, aims it right at the back of him, and shoots him in the back.
[00:14:40.078 --> 00:14:40.659]  It goes through.
[00:14:42.747 --> 00:14:54.070]  They shot him right below the neck, right in the middle of the upper back, went down into his lungs, and then there's footage of the paramedics showing up, getting him out of there, saying, fight, fight, come on, hold on, hold on.
[00:14:54.090 --> 00:15:03.013]  And I've been there when one of my friends was dying in the hospital, and we were all, you know, the doctors were saying, tell him, hold on, tell him, hold on, and I had to get in there and say, hold on, he still died.
[00:15:04.233 --> 00:15:06.073]  That memory is just, you know, there.
[00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:08.254]  I'm there with my parents.
[00:15:09.214 --> 00:15:10.914]  I'm there with my childhood friend.
[00:15:10.934 --> 00:15:12.095]  You know, his mom's there.
[00:15:12.175 --> 00:15:14.255]  His dad was driving down from Dallas, 80 miles an hour.
[00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:16.115]  And I watched him.
[00:15:16.135 --> 00:15:19.196]  You know, his eyes were alert and were like, you know, you gotta fight, you gotta fight.
[00:15:19.216 --> 00:15:22.116]  And he was sort of trying to get his leg out of the bed and you could see him fighting.
[00:15:22.136 --> 00:15:24.757]  And then he, his eyes rolled back in his head after about 20 minutes.
[00:15:24.797 --> 00:15:27.998]  And then they were pumping him full of all these drugs just to keep him alive.
[00:15:28.418 --> 00:15:29.998]  He was literally like a zombie then.
[00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:40.151]  All of his core functions were shutting down, and then his dad got there and he died.
[00:15:41.772 --> 00:15:46.534]  They took him off the respirator, but he was conscious and alive on the respirator, sitting there while I was talking to him.
[00:15:46.714 --> 00:15:47.714]  But I'm flashing back to that.
[00:15:47.754 --> 00:15:48.555]  That's a side issue.
[00:15:50.054 --> 00:15:52.999]  It brought me back to that, to have the paramedics and the firemen going, come on!
[00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:53.420]  Fight!
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:53.860]  Fight!
[00:15:54.001 --> 00:15:54.301]  Fight!
[00:15:54.922 --> 00:15:55.223]  Fight!
[00:15:55.824 --> 00:15:59.169]  And the guy was, and you could see him on the gurney, you could see him just fighting, fighting.
[00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:00.732]  Can you imagine laboring not to die?
[00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:03.476]  I mean it just, it's just so horrible.
[00:16:04.522 --> 00:16:05.783]  And so it's that humanity there.
[00:16:05.823 --> 00:16:12.986]  And then I saw people on my comment page on InfoWars going, eh, that guy shouldn't have been out late, you know, after New Year's to see the fireworks.
[00:16:13.026 --> 00:16:13.947]  He should have been with his daughter.
[00:16:13.987 --> 00:16:17.008]  They were dehumanizing him and saying, so the officer made a mistake, so what?
[00:16:17.048 --> 00:16:17.949]  Some eggs get broken.
[00:16:18.609 --> 00:16:19.550]  And just that attitude.
[00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.952]  And then seeing that guy fighting for his life, and then he died by the time he got to the hospital.
[00:16:25.029 --> 00:16:33.893]  But that, the issue is, is that these BART police with the subway system in San Francisco and surrounding areas have done this repeatedly.
[00:16:34.233 --> 00:16:37.994]  And I did a lot of research on this last night and printed off all these articles.
[00:16:38.294 --> 00:16:45.958]  This big stack, there's no way to go over all of them today, but there's so many facets to this.
[00:16:47.258 --> 00:16:53.561]  Number one, the police are saying that they believe that the officer
[00:16:54.952 --> 00:16:56.033]  Had taser confusion.
[00:16:56.973 --> 00:16:58.934]  That he thought he was pulling his taser.
[00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:00.735]  Well, that's what the studies show.
[00:17:01.175 --> 00:17:18.443]  That now that police are so acclimated to shooting someone with the firearm-like device that fires electric hooks, that it is habituating them to the idea of pulling a weapon and firing it.
[00:17:20.243 --> 00:17:29.748]  And so in the heat of the moment, which was all the police officers in a delusional mindset, I mean, they're freaking out, they're yelling, they're commanding, the guys are okay, okay.
[00:17:30.228 --> 00:17:34.650]  They're abusing one guy, jumping on him and slamming his head in the ground and putting their knees on his head.
[00:17:34.671 --> 00:17:35.531]  He's submitting.
[00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:38.332]  He turns around and goes like this, and they just, bam!
[00:17:38.693 --> 00:17:40.173]  You know, bring his head down and jump on him.
[00:17:40.453 --> 00:17:42.054]  And the other guy's like, don't hurt me, don't hurt me!
[00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:47.797]  And they put him down and they pull the gun and they shoot him.
[00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:48.778]  And while I'm talking,
[00:17:49.793 --> 00:17:56.917]  Without audio, fast forward it and let's show people the shooting video they're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:17:58.118 --> 00:18:08.323]  So, A, there's the issue of the overreactions, the police all amped up in this paramilitary idea that they're in Fallujah fighting a enemy instead of being peace officers.
[00:18:08.343 --> 00:18:10.685]  They don't have a true warrior's restraint.
[00:18:12.766 --> 00:18:13.006]  Okay?
[00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:19.113]  Then there is the issue of the police lied.
[00:18:19.514 --> 00:18:42.314]  For three days after this happened, through Monday, from last Friday, they were saying, well, there was an altercation, there was a tussle, there was a disturbance going on between the officers and these guys, and he was not restrained, they were not restrained, and that's lie number two, because he was restrained, they were on top of him when they shot him.
[00:18:45.286 --> 00:18:47.988]  And they went on to say there's not any video of it.
[00:18:48.008 --> 00:18:54.634]  The videos that were there at the DART station, those cameras weren't recording that day.
[00:18:55.194 --> 00:18:55.835]  Probably a lie.
[00:18:57.156 --> 00:18:58.377]  But then they didn't tell the public.
[00:18:58.397 --> 00:19:04.342]  They confiscated two videos shot by people on the platform there at the subway, there at the train station.
[00:19:05.162 --> 00:19:08.745]  So they're lying to the public saying we don't have any videos while they have videos.
[00:19:08.865 --> 00:19:10.487]  Well, thank God
[00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:17.110]  Folks pulling up in the next train saw the altercation start, that's the video on your screen, and caught it on tape.
[00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:22.356]  And now another video from on the platform, not the train, also caught it from another angle.
[00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:34.946]  So the issue here is, the big overriding issue is, the lying and deception of the police in this case, which is par for the course.
[00:19:35.846 --> 00:19:42.788]  It has become acceptable for them to cover their own butts, even when they've committed murder or possibly manslaughter.
[00:19:43.188 --> 00:19:44.369]  Maybe the lesser manslaughter.
[00:19:45.149 --> 00:19:48.933]  But they indict themselves by lying about it and trying to cover up.
[00:19:49.553 --> 00:19:50.834]  So cameras go two ways.
[00:19:50.854 --> 00:19:54.918]  You can surveil us, but we can surveil you, and we are.
[00:19:54.938 --> 00:19:58.642]  So you're playing an old game, decades old, and you can get away with lying.
[00:19:58.882 --> 00:19:59.603]  You can't do it now.
[00:20:02.981 --> 00:20:04.943]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:20:05.343 --> 00:20:11.307]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[00:20:39.565 --> 00:20:39.825]  I think so.
[00:21:01.297 --> 00:21:07.702]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:08.062 --> 00:21:10.043]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:11.744]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:12.265 --> 00:21:12.765]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:13.045 --> 00:21:13.886]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:13.966 --> 00:21:15.367]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:17.088]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:17.428 --> 00:21:24.173]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:24.573 --> 00:21:25.014]  Some U.S.
[00:21:25.054 --> 00:21:30.738]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:31.398 --> 00:21:34.881]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:34.901 --> 00:21:45.149]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.110]  Fabled enemies.

[00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:03.879]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.982]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[00:22:09.422 --> 00:22:11.283]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:12.524]  We are under the microscope.
[00:22:12.704 --> 00:22:16.546]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[00:22:16.726 --> 00:22:20.108]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.

[00:22:39.366 --> 00:22:39.887]  I think so.
[00:23:01.252 --> 00:23:03.113]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:03.233 --> 00:23:08.414]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:09.935]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:23:10.215 --> 00:23:18.378]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:18.598 --> 00:23:24.320]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.302]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:26.342 --> 00:23:28.525]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:28.545 --> 00:23:32.890]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:33.051 --> 00:23:35.173]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:24:08.163 --> 00:24:10.744]  Okay, let's just get right back into the transmission here.
[00:24:14.825 --> 00:24:18.447]  The videos, again, are all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:18.847 --> 00:24:20.628]  There's two separate videos of the shooting.
[00:24:22.649 --> 00:24:32.553]  So they're not resisting, they slam them down on the ground, two of them, and the police officer just pulls his handgun out, shoots the man in the back, and gives him a lethal blow.
[00:24:34.653 --> 00:24:35.774]  He later died at the hospital.
[00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.832]  Then the police say there's no videotapes of this.
[00:24:39.193 --> 00:24:42.276]  The video cameras were not recording at the DART station.
[00:24:43.458 --> 00:24:47.963]  Then we learn they confiscate videos from people that were shooting them on cell phones, but not all of them.
[00:24:48.383 --> 00:24:50.986]  Then they lie and say there are no other videos.
[00:24:51.026 --> 00:24:55.632]  And then Monday, it breaks on the news that people did get the videos to the news.
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.002]  And so then the videos are released, and it shows they're lying there.
[00:25:00.062 --> 00:25:03.365]  But now the media isn't finishing their job.
[00:25:03.425 --> 00:25:11.792]  They're not pointing out that there was a lie about the fact that there were no videotapes of this, or that the police had confiscated them and were lying about that.
[00:25:12.512 --> 00:25:18.177]  Or that the police lied and claimed there was some type of altercation going on between the officers and these young men.
[00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.291]  Then the story changed.
[00:25:20.331 --> 00:25:27.897]  They were there because of a previous altercation, but the police had lied and made it semantically sound like the altercation was with police and the young men, when the video shows they're doing nothing.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:39.006]  So, there are just so many examples of this over and over again, and we have the different press conferences that the DART officials and police
[00:25:40.051 --> 00:26:08.786]  have put on is not the san francisco or oakland police uh... this is uh... the dart uh... transit police are all over that area and again they don't have really any oversight and a lot of uh... police agencies are pointing that out in california has a bad history of this and so is the attorney general of california and i want to investigation on monday when these videos came out so the issue here is deception and lying about this in the public needs to realize that
[00:26:09.546 --> 00:26:14.528]  Lying by police agencies is the rule, not the exception.
[00:26:16.888 --> 00:26:20.790]  And then we have to discuss the fact that this guy is on paid administrative leave.
[00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.811]  We don't even know the name of this officer.
[00:26:24.071 --> 00:26:25.991]  He, bare minimum, needs to get manslaughter.
[00:26:26.812 --> 00:26:29.332]  Even if it wasn't intentional and he really thought it was his taser.
[00:26:29.352 --> 00:26:30.493]  And he hasn't said that yet.
[00:26:30.973 --> 00:26:33.494]  Police groups are saying it looks like he thought it was his taser.
[00:26:33.974 --> 00:26:36.815]  And I tend to agree that it could be that because
[00:26:37.952 --> 00:26:48.661]  He pulls it out, aims, fires right into the man's back, and then goes like that, and according to witnesses, we don't have the audio, starts cussing, and the police are like, what in the world just happened?
[00:26:50.603 --> 00:27:00.952]  So you have this trigger-happy, unstable person, you've got them militarized like they're fighting some enemy force, they're no longer peace officers, you've got this guy begging.
[00:27:03.106 --> 00:27:05.007]  Begging for them not to hurt him.
[00:27:05.247 --> 00:27:05.827]  And so what do they do?
[00:27:05.867 --> 00:27:06.287]  They kill him.
[00:27:06.307 --> 00:27:07.407]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:27:07.447 --> 00:27:09.448]  This is the police with just a few of their lives.
[00:27:09.468 --> 00:27:11.288]  There's a whole bunch of these clips.
[00:27:11.328 --> 00:27:11.688]  Here it is.
[00:27:12.689 --> 00:27:19.551]  We'll roll that with the BART spokesman up there speaking to everybody.
[00:27:19.811 --> 00:27:23.452]  A lot of verbal jockeying, a lot of arguing between the two groups of men.
[00:27:24.514 --> 00:27:29.196]  At some point, an officer's firearm discharged, striking Mr. Grant.
[00:27:29.716 --> 00:27:35.298]  Witnesses claim that BART police confronted 22-year-old Oscar Grant on the Fruitvale platform.
[00:27:36.358 --> 00:27:45.101]  Okay, so notice how he semantically said there was verbal jockeying going on between the men at some time, and he's leaving it open.
[00:27:47.962 --> 00:27:49.883]  The officer discharged his firearm.
[00:27:50.714 --> 00:28:00.586]  And then they go on, in other clips from that press conference, you can watch the whole lengthy thing on YouTube and Google, to go on and say that he was not restrained.
[00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:03.369]  Well, the police were on top of him.
[00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:05.732]  They'd slammed him down, holding him down when they shot him.
[00:28:07.315 --> 00:28:12.476]  And you can watch all that on the video, but the bigger issue is they lied about not having videos.
[00:28:12.496 --> 00:28:13.757]  They said there are no videos.
[00:28:14.237 --> 00:28:16.838]  And we have all these clips, but if you want to go watch them on the web, you can.
[00:28:17.238 --> 00:28:22.879]  In the interest of time, we're not going to be able to play all of those because this is quite a bloody soap opera.
[00:28:22.899 --> 00:28:25.480]  Go ahead and play a little bit more of this clip.
[00:28:33.288 --> 00:28:40.235]  Our preliminary investigation indicates that Mr. Grant was not restrained when the officer's firearm discharged.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:45.122]  Bart says several other men were cuffed and the officer's gun was out of the holster.
[00:28:45.242 --> 00:28:47.262]  They don't know yet if the shooting was an accident.
[00:28:47.623 --> 00:28:49.563]  Police found no weapons among the men.
[00:28:50.003 --> 00:28:52.424]  Oscar Grant was rushed to Oakland's Highland Hospital.
[00:28:52.704 --> 00:28:56.946]  Our trauma team immediately took over and began working on him.
[00:28:57.286 --> 00:29:00.887]  Now again, basically everything this Bart spokesman says turns out to not be true.
[00:29:02.968 --> 00:29:05.049]  But notice he says, well it was out of the holster.
[00:29:05.289 --> 00:29:06.109]  They knew the whole time.
[00:29:06.129 --> 00:29:07.370]  They confiscated the videos.
[00:29:08.254 --> 00:29:12.996]  They were telling the public that they didn't have the BART videos, which I don't believe for a minute.
[00:29:13.756 --> 00:29:16.677]  So you can just go right down the line, there's more and more of these clips.
[00:29:18.118 --> 00:29:22.799]  So he's out saying there was an altercation, officers were there, the guy was not restrained.
[00:29:23.259 --> 00:29:28.301]  All that sells the image that this guy was up and about in an altercation and somehow somebody gets shot.
[00:29:28.781 --> 00:29:35.524]  Then the videos come out and it's exactly what the witnesses said, which was 180 degrees from what the police were saying.
[00:29:36.448 --> 00:29:37.229]  And this guy's dead.
[00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:43.936]  So thank God that more and more citizens know to keep their cameras trained on the police.
[00:29:43.996 --> 00:29:48.120]  And we have cell phone cameras and iPhone cameras and others proliferating everywhere.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.081]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.944 --> 00:29:52.845]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.325 --> 00:29:54.947]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.868 --> 00:29:58.551]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.658 --> 00:30:10.082]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:30:10.383 --> 00:30:16.045]  At HempUSA.org we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[00:30:16.366 --> 00:30:22.889]  At HempUSA.org we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.734]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:30:26.854 --> 00:30:29.116]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:31:01.314 --> 00:31:03.055]  I have everybody's attention please.
[00:31:03.175 --> 00:31:05.576]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:31:05.596 --> 00:31:08.157]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:31:08.177 --> 00:31:09.398]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:31:09.418 --> 00:31:11.058]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:31:11.138 --> 00:31:13.960]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:18.942]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, that for a lateral commission, the CFR, to release
[00:31:27.313 --> 00:31:32.162]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:31:35.974 --> 00:31:37.054]  How dare you!
[00:31:38.595 --> 00:31:43.476]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:31:43.636 --> 00:31:46.277]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:31:46.377 --> 00:31:52.798]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:33:02.169 --> 00:33:03.497]  Yeah.
[00:33:06.274 --> 00:33:12.296]  We've only got Ray McGovern for 10 minutes with us, but he's agreed to come back for 30 minutes or longer next week.
[00:33:13.156 --> 00:33:20.238]  He was on Laird News Hour last night giving his take on Barack Obama's intelligence agency appointments, or near appointments.
[00:33:20.258 --> 00:33:24.999]  Then I want to spend a few minutes with him on the Gaza situation.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:33.302]  Of course, Ray McGovern, CIA analyst, morning briefer for Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr., and others, and he's the guy who exposed the fact in his face
[00:33:34.022 --> 00:33:35.863]  Well, I'm not a big favorite of Gates.
[00:33:36.503 --> 00:33:39.584]  He worked for me at one point back in the 60s, early 70s.
[00:33:59.196 --> 00:34:00.597]  I don't have a good opinion of him.
[00:34:01.017 --> 00:34:06.358]  Besides that, he espouses policies that Obama is, at least theoretically, against.
[00:34:07.019 --> 00:34:19.583]  National Missile Defense, putting missiles in the Czech Republic and Poland, doing other things that appeal to the military-industrial complex.
[00:34:20.043 --> 00:34:26.745]  Gates is a threat, and I'm afraid that Obama's made things more difficult for him by keeping Gates on.
[00:34:27.574 --> 00:34:30.815]  What about the new folks that he's moving into the appointments?
[00:34:31.975 --> 00:34:37.236]  Well, Leon Panetta is an old Washington hand who knows the ropes.
[00:34:39.476 --> 00:34:43.097]  He was chief of staff for Clinton for a while.
[00:34:43.177 --> 00:34:46.237]  He was head of the Bureau of Management and Budget.
[00:34:46.857 --> 00:34:49.038]  He was a big budget guy in the Congress.
[00:34:49.058 --> 00:34:54.519]  As a matter of fact, people don't realize this, but Panetta was one of those responsible for budget surplus.
[00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:55.179]  Can you imagine that?
[00:34:55.606 --> 00:34:56.627]  You know what surplus means?
[00:34:57.808 --> 00:34:58.508]  You know?
[00:34:58.608 --> 00:34:59.950]  In the 90s under Clinton.
[00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.130]  So he's a bright guy.
[00:35:01.151 --> 00:35:02.231]  He's as bright as they come.
[00:35:02.291 --> 00:35:05.374]  More important, he's got unimpeachable integrity.
[00:35:06.595 --> 00:35:09.918]  And he's made a name for himself outside intelligence work.
[00:35:10.598 --> 00:35:11.859]  And he's a good manager.
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.943]  And those are the prerequisites for a good director of intelligence.
[00:35:15.963 --> 00:35:20.246]  And I speak from some experience on this, Alex, since I served under nine of them.
[00:35:20.566 --> 00:35:20.907]  Nine.
[00:35:21.787 --> 00:35:22.468]  What about Blair?
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.181]  Blair is a... the returns are not all in on Blair.
[00:35:27.601 --> 00:35:29.642]  My colleagues, some of them, worked with him.
[00:35:30.322 --> 00:35:49.189]  He is said to be a pretty good strategic thinker, but when you look at how he acted, for example, when he was chief of forces in the Pacific, and the Indonesian generals decided to give a real bloody nose to the indigenous people in East Timor, before Timor got its independence,
[00:35:49.912 --> 00:35:58.597]  Well, Blair was supposed to restrain them, and he was supposed to go to the generals and say, look, stop massacring people in churches and doing all manner of other things like that.
[00:35:59.218 --> 00:36:15.668]  And instead, despite the instructions from the State Department and from the National Security Council, Blair coddled these generals because he saw as his mission the coddling of military opposite numbers in Indonesia, a very important country.
[00:36:16.314 --> 00:36:33.839]  And so that gives me pause, you know, that really gives me great pause because this story is corroborated by cables that were leaked to certain reporters, cables from the State Department and from the NSC saying, look, get them to stop the atrocities.
[00:36:34.319 --> 00:36:40.461]  And instead of that, by all accounts, Blair went ahead and told them, well, you know, it's going to be all right.
[00:36:40.521 --> 00:36:41.881]  We'll support you no matter what.
[00:36:42.141 --> 00:36:44.042]  That's an old syndrome in the military.
[00:36:44.462 --> 00:36:45.622]  I hope he's outgrown that.
[00:36:47.983 --> 00:37:12.408]  Mr. McGovern, in the time that we have left with you, bottom line, what is your analysis of what happened in Mumbai, formerly Bombay, three weeks ago, four weeks ago, just briefly, and then currently what's happening in Gaza with the Israeli siege and encirclement of the three major cities there?
[00:37:13.837 --> 00:37:20.619]  Well, I don't know much about Mumbai that hasn't been in the newspapers, but I do know something about the problem in Gaza.
[00:37:21.419 --> 00:37:24.780]  It is unconscionable what the Israeli forces are doing there.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.820]  They couldn't do it without the blessing of our government.
[00:37:28.761 --> 00:37:29.721]  So we're all to blame.
[00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:32.882]  We're all responsible for these atrocities.
[00:37:33.482 --> 00:37:35.042]  It is ethnic cleansing.
[00:37:35.722 --> 00:37:42.104]  It is the removal, to the degree they can, of all the Palestinians that inhabit that part of the world.
[00:37:42.754 --> 00:37:59.591]  It is just beyond belief that we as a nation would sit still for the bombing of civilians, the killing of some 550 people now, 550 Palestinians as opposed to I think the last number I saw, 7 Israelis.
[00:37:59.631 --> 00:38:02.634]  Now does that sound disproportionate to you?
[00:38:02.654 --> 00:38:04.115]  It certainly sounds disproportionate.
[00:38:05.184 --> 00:38:14.408]  We have a high-tech military that broke the ceasefire in multiple ways, in bombings and shutting down the entrance points to the Gaza Strip.
[00:38:14.728 --> 00:38:22.451]  And then we have this hoax in our media that Hamas singularly is to blame for breaking the truce.
[00:38:23.711 --> 00:38:28.573]  Yeah, you know, what I call the fawning corporate media, the FCM.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:30.900]  We're good.
[00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:56.802]  Or the Native Americans.
[00:38:56.822 --> 00:39:13.755]  You know, Hitler wrote, as you know, sir, that he took his concentration camp strategy from what happened in the West, in the United States, in the 1860s and 70s and 80s and 90s, and then the Israelis, it's come out, have actually adopted some of those same systems.
[00:39:14.776 --> 00:39:19.760]  Yeah, and I've heard, well, I was in Israel summer before last,
[00:39:20.646 --> 00:39:28.111]  A very prominent settler on the top of one of these gleaming hills told me, look, don't criticize us for what we're doing.
[00:39:28.131 --> 00:39:29.512]  Look what you did to the Indians.
[00:39:30.353 --> 00:39:32.074]  And I said to him, look, that was then.
[00:39:32.655 --> 00:39:33.595]  We're sorry for that.
[00:39:33.716 --> 00:39:35.197]  We still have to atone for that.
[00:39:35.237 --> 00:39:36.257]  But now is now.
[00:39:37.178 --> 00:39:45.204]  And when I watch, when I look at these, every hillside topped by gleaming alabaster settlements,
[00:39:45.894 --> 00:39:53.735]  Where down in the villages below, people are deprived of wells, of running water, of access to their fields.
[00:39:53.755 --> 00:39:56.176]  You know, this is really, really bad, Alex.
[00:39:56.296 --> 00:40:06.438]  And we have to wake up the American people, because if they knew, I still have enough faith in the American people, if they knew what was really going on there, we would do something about it.
[00:40:06.878 --> 00:40:13.439]  We would pursue our Congress people, our Senators, and make sure that they did not give $3 billion
[00:40:14.344 --> 00:40:17.746]  Every year to Israel to perpetrate these atrocities.
[00:40:18.987 --> 00:40:25.290]  In closing, I want to talk about how you, from past operations that we've seen with the Israelis, how this will play out.
[00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:31.793]  And will they turn north into Lebanon, as they're saying they may do now, and try to widen this, trying to blame it on Iran.
[00:40:32.154 --> 00:40:34.695]  Right now claiming they're behind Hamas.
[00:40:34.715 --> 00:40:36.456]  We know they're behind Hezbollah, but not Hamas.
[00:40:37.416 --> 00:40:38.157]  You know, that point,
[00:40:39.313 --> 00:40:50.261]  But first, did the Israelis not launch this during the interim when Bush is a lame duck with the three weeks left at that time when they launched it, and when Obama isn't in yet so that there's that smoke screen?
[00:40:50.301 --> 00:40:52.703]  I mean, they did launch the attacks on Christmas Eve.
[00:40:53.964 --> 00:40:55.545]  Yeah, that was part of the plan, of course.
[00:40:55.565 --> 00:41:00.089]  There's no better friend, so to speak, of Israel than George Bush.
[00:41:00.149 --> 00:41:02.110]  He's not going to do anything about it, of course.
[00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.753]  He's not even permitted his folks to call for a ceasefire.
[00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:07.098]  So that was part of it.
[00:41:07.118 --> 00:41:11.241]  The other part has to do with who's the most belligerent in Israel.
[00:41:11.882 --> 00:41:14.464]  There's an election coming up in about six weeks.
[00:41:15.004 --> 00:41:20.369]  It looks like Netanyahu, who's Mr. Belligerent, has the edge.
[00:41:20.469 --> 00:41:30.277]  So Tzipi Livni and Barack, the defense minister, are trying to appear just as aggressive.
[00:41:30.838 --> 00:41:34.681]  So you have the political dynamic in both countries at work here.
[00:41:35.106 --> 00:41:44.775]  And of course, on the receiving end of all this stuff, are the people in Gaza crammed into a very short area, 1.5 million of them.
[00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:54.204]  So, this has got to stop, and if we don't act as a restraining force, then the Israelis just might.
[00:41:54.484 --> 00:42:00.670]  There's an outside chance that the Israelis might feel so hubrisful
[00:42:01.314 --> 00:42:14.108]  That they would say, hmm, you know, Bush has almost two weeks left, you know, why don't we blame the Iranians for something really big that happens to our forces and go take out some of those sites in Iran?
[00:42:14.148 --> 00:42:19.174]  Then the Americans would have to be full square behind us because Bush has promised to do that.
[00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:21.271]  That's still a concern of mine.
[00:42:21.431 --> 00:42:33.561]  Well, sir, that's what you said here six months ago was, I remember seeing this even in the press, that some of the neocons in Israel were saying the time to attack would be after Obama was elected, in between that interim time.
[00:42:33.881 --> 00:42:37.504]  Yeah, I think the real sticking point here is two things.
[00:42:38.025 --> 00:42:45.851]  One is that Admiral Mullen, the head of the Joint Chiefs, probably would delay for two weeks before he carried out orders like that.
[00:42:46.471 --> 00:42:48.333]  It just would be seen so crassly
[00:42:48.954 --> 00:42:59.683]  As Jeanne Bush's last gasp, that I doubt, I doubt whether a moment in order to do that would set its forces on Iran.
[00:42:59.923 --> 00:43:10.172]  The other thing is that the Russians, after that fracas in Georgia, the Russians came to the Israelis and to us and said, look, you know, we've had it.
[00:43:10.332 --> 00:43:10.832]  That's enough.
[00:43:11.212 --> 00:43:11.693]  That's enough.
[00:43:12.093 --> 00:43:14.175]  We don't want any more of this stuff in our backyard.
[00:43:14.655 --> 00:43:17.357]  Don't even think, don't even think of attacking Iran.
[00:43:17.398 --> 00:43:17.858]  And I think
[00:43:18.385 --> 00:43:24.489]  If you look at the timing, early August, that's when all the propaganda fell off, and that's when the Israelis and the U.S.
[00:43:24.509 --> 00:43:27.331]  started getting more sensible in their approach to Iran.
[00:43:28.211 --> 00:43:32.594]  Do you think, in closing, that Obama will put the missiles in Poland and Ukraine?
[00:43:34.035 --> 00:43:34.535]  I hope not.
[00:43:35.596 --> 00:43:38.878]  He's got Gates there, and Gates is strongly for it.
[00:43:40.299 --> 00:43:45.682]  It all depends, really, on how much beholden Barack Obama is to the
[00:43:46.314 --> 00:43:49.637]  Military-industrial complex, because that's what this is all about.
[00:43:49.737 --> 00:43:51.378]  Missile systems that won't work.
[00:43:51.538 --> 00:43:53.700]  Missile systems that can always be overcome.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.801]  Well, look at Rahm Emanuel!
[00:43:54.841 --> 00:43:55.761]  Look at Rahm Emanuel!
[00:43:55.801 --> 00:43:57.883]  I mean, is that not a sign of where Obama's going?
[00:43:58.323 --> 00:43:59.424]  Well, we'll see.
[00:44:00.265 --> 00:44:06.870]  I like to think that with these last appointments in the Justice Department and at the CIA, that he's getting back in balance.
[00:44:07.256 --> 00:44:21.082]  Maybe when you're on next week, we can talk about the possibility, now that you're in remission from lymphoma cancer, we all prayed for you, that we can talk about you writing a book or something, because you're so respected and have called so many things accurately.
[00:44:21.462 --> 00:44:23.863]  Are you looking at writing a book?
[00:44:23.883 --> 00:44:32.927]  Because every time I have you on, I wish there was something I could plug so people could... I mean, you're in my film, Terror Storm, but other than that, so folks can really get an idea about your perspective.
[00:44:33.347 --> 00:44:36.168]  Well, they can look on ConsortiumNews.com.
[00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:41.031]  That's c-o-n-s-o-r-t-i-u-m-news-dot-com.
[00:44:41.491 --> 00:44:44.932]  That's my blog of choice, where I publish first.
[00:44:45.532 --> 00:44:47.072]  I will write to write a book, Alex.
[00:44:47.172 --> 00:44:48.412]  I'm afraid I'd lose my wife.
[00:44:51.373 --> 00:44:53.634]  I've got to run off now, but it's been fun being with you.
[00:44:53.934 --> 00:44:54.754]  Thank you, Ray McGovern.
[00:44:54.774 --> 00:44:55.654]  We'll talk to you next week.
[00:44:55.814 --> 00:44:56.474]  Okay, bye.
[00:44:56.834 --> 00:44:57.494]  There he goes.
[00:44:58.334 --> 00:44:59.635]  You'd think I'd learn how to read.
[00:44:59.955 --> 00:45:01.175]  Here's my producer folder.
[00:45:03.536 --> 00:45:04.236]  Ray McGovern, 1 to 130.
[00:45:06.533 --> 00:45:09.655]  And I somehow looked at that and had it from 1.30 to 2.
[00:45:10.656 --> 00:45:12.337]  That's how my brain works.
[00:45:12.758 --> 00:45:14.399]  And he wasn't going to be with us longer.
[00:45:14.859 --> 00:45:15.219]  You know what?
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:20.864]  Aaron, set him up for a full hour next week because I know he'll agree to do it.
[00:45:21.384 --> 00:45:22.385]  I've never talked about that.
[00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:25.547]  He was the boss of Gates for years.
[00:45:27.208 --> 00:45:30.391]  And we could really get a perspective into the Defense Secretary from Ray McGovern.
[00:45:30.891 --> 00:45:32.232]  I mean, that guy has been everywhere.
[00:45:32.332 --> 00:45:35.114]  He was also an Army captain, of course, in Vietnam.
[00:45:35.354 --> 00:45:35.795]  What's going on?
[00:45:36.738 --> 00:45:43.741]  Now, yes, yes, I'm saying set Raymond Governor up for an hour next week.
[00:45:45.362 --> 00:45:54.145]  Oh, before I forget, while my producer's in there, let's get this former chief strategist policymaker from the Bank of England.
[00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:58.827]  He's saying we're going to have a depression and a devaluation of the dollar in two to five years.
[00:46:00.508 --> 00:46:02.629]  Steve Watson did an article on that today at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:02.649 --> 00:46:03.189]  Before I forget,
[00:46:04.175 --> 00:46:05.116]  I've got to multitask, folks.
[00:46:05.136 --> 00:46:06.197]  I've got to do all this on air.
[00:46:06.237 --> 00:46:10.682]  I'm like, during the breaks, I'm directing the TV show and trying to figure out what clips to get ready.
[00:46:10.742 --> 00:46:14.065]  I want to just say, we've been doing these TV shows in here now for, what, about two weeks?
[00:46:14.585 --> 00:46:16.267]  You guys are just getting better and better and better.
[00:46:16.968 --> 00:46:18.690]  We're having to expand the control room, though.
[00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:22.113]  Having three guys crammed in there, that's a bit of a problem.
[00:46:23.337 --> 00:46:25.119]  I need to do what I said I'd do two weeks ago.
[00:46:25.139 --> 00:46:33.145]  I need to get a camera out and kind of give folks a tour of this studio, of the control room out there, maybe interview you guys so people know who's behind the scenes.
[00:46:33.786 --> 00:46:35.007]  Well, wait, I could do that right now.
[00:46:35.067 --> 00:46:43.533]  We could rig one of these cameras up with a wireless unit into the feed and I could just walk around the office that way instead of videotaping it and editing it.
[00:46:43.553 --> 00:46:45.195]  It's a lot easier to do everything on the fly.
[00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:45.455]  No, no.
[00:46:46.055 --> 00:46:50.459]  Perhaps Friday, we should gear up Friday for a segment during PrisonPlanet.tv to
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.421]  Oh, there we go.
[00:46:54.461 --> 00:46:56.402]  He just rotated one of the robot cameras around.
[00:46:56.742 --> 00:46:58.364]  Yeah, go ahead and punch it up with you guys in there.
[00:47:00.545 --> 00:47:03.208]  Unfortunately, that camera is right up against the glass.
[00:47:03.728 --> 00:47:05.289]  There's Jaron right there.
[00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.992]  He's pointing his thumb over there at Paul Hartman, a.k.a.
[00:47:09.072 --> 00:47:09.593]  Hoosh.
[00:47:10.614 --> 00:47:12.835]  Fan of the Hoosiers over there.
[00:47:13.856 --> 00:47:15.718]  And there he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:27.645]  You know, soon we're going to have a document cam mounted on the ceiling up behind me, and so it'll be able to shoot down through the glass into those guys that are in there right on the show.
[00:47:29.045 --> 00:47:33.688]  Okay, I am really rambling here, ladies and gentlemen, but that's what I do best.
[00:47:36.969 --> 00:47:37.229]  You know what?
[00:47:37.249 --> 00:47:38.630]  I want to go back to the BART video.
[00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:42.432]  Go back to the shooting video, because I ran out of time before McGovern was on with us.
[00:47:43.581 --> 00:47:44.281]  To cover that.
[00:47:45.101 --> 00:48:06.726]  Now remember, the police are saying here that they didn't have any videos and that the surveillance cameras in the BART facility there at the train station, there at the train stop, first weren't hooked into the recorders and then, oh, they didn't get a recording.
[00:48:07.186 --> 00:48:13.147]  Meanwhile, we find out within minutes, this is days later they're saying this, knowing they confiscated cell phones that video on them.
[00:48:15.199 --> 00:48:24.303]  But again, thank God, a train pulled in, a subway car pulled in, and people were videotaping out of that, and people down the platform got video of the shooting.
[00:48:25.244 --> 00:48:31.106]  And, you know, I said it earlier, the system is playing a game from 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago.
[00:48:32.878 --> 00:48:34.239]  Depending on which system they're involved in.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:42.685]  And so they're used to lying, killing, covering up, engaging in corruption, without our cameras pointed back at them.
[00:48:43.486 --> 00:48:53.353]  So nine times out of ten, it's their own cameras that they have to lie and claim malfunctioned or they don't have the footage, in every case, that's actually acting against them.
[00:48:53.854 --> 00:48:57.356]  And then it's our cameras that are built into the cell phones and everything that are having a problem.
[00:48:58.377 --> 00:48:59.998]  That's why they want to shut down the Internet.
[00:49:00.339 --> 00:49:02.440]  And the inventor of the Internet came out this week.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.442]  Paul Watson did an article on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:49:04.482 --> 00:49:06.303]  It's there in the News in Focus section.
[00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:07.464]  I didn't cover it and should have.
[00:49:08.843 --> 00:49:14.805]  about the fact saying that the internet is dying and that's what Internet2 said they would do five years ago.
[00:49:14.845 --> 00:49:36.991]  They said we're gonna not upgrade the old web, we're not going to build new hubs, we're going to let it fail and shut it down through getting rid of net neutrality and taxes and regulations and filters and controls and we're going to force you over an Internet2 where no one has an individual website but select corporations, they say 50 universities, 50 select corporations and government agencies.
[00:49:37.671 --> 00:49:41.494]  And so, they'll say, sorry, you don't get a sub-page on the new MySpace Internet 2.
[00:49:41.814 --> 00:49:44.476]  You don't get a sub-page on the new YouTube Internet 2.
[00:49:45.157 --> 00:49:52.662]  Or, you sign an agreement, you know, when your Terms of Service, when you click, and you register, saying they can erase you, they can delete you, they can restrict you.
[00:49:53.303 --> 00:49:56.165]  So, this is the larger program.
[00:49:56.185 --> 00:50:01.829]  But go ahead and punch that video back up, and just go ahead and roll out to break the audio of the shooting.
[00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:02.490]  Go ahead, here it is.
[00:50:03.288 --> 00:50:08.950]  Go take in from the BART train recorded on a cell phone by a passenger who doesn't want to be identified.
[00:50:09.491 --> 00:50:13.212]  You can see 22 year old Oscar Grant on his knees talking to police.
[00:50:13.812 --> 00:50:16.053]  He is pulled onto the ground face down.
[00:50:16.514 --> 00:50:22.136]  Then after what appears to be a struggle, a BART officer puts his knee to Grant's neck and head and another officer's
[00:50:22.576 --> 00:50:23.296]  Stop right there!
[00:50:23.317 --> 00:50:23.917]  Stop right there!
[00:50:23.937 --> 00:50:24.557]  Stop right there!
[00:50:24.717 --> 00:50:30.600]  Every time I see police jump on somebody and beat them up for no reason, they call it a tussle or a struggle.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.360]  The guy has his hands like this.
[00:50:32.981 --> 00:50:33.581]  They grab him.
[00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:34.241]  They put him down.
[00:50:34.301 --> 00:50:35.102]  He's doing nothing.
[00:50:35.142 --> 00:50:36.042]  They jump on him.
[00:50:36.242 --> 00:50:37.423]  You see his body flinch.
[00:50:38.263 --> 00:50:38.683]  And they do that.
[00:50:38.703 --> 00:50:41.885]  They go, oh, I just jumped on your neck with my 250-pound body.
[00:50:42.645 --> 00:50:44.146]  How dare you flinch in pain?
[00:50:44.226 --> 00:50:44.646]  That's it.
[00:50:44.746 --> 00:50:45.686]  I'm going to taser you.
[00:50:46.087 --> 00:50:51.369]  But he pulls a gun and shoots him in the back.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.102]  So notice the media even, what appears to be a tussle.
[00:50:55.402 --> 00:50:57.084]  They'll probably say he deserved to die next.
[00:50:57.484 --> 00:50:59.285]  Ah well, he attacked the officers, he's dead.
[00:50:59.305 --> 00:51:00.226]  Heil Hitler!
[00:51:02.208 --> 00:51:06.031]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:08.606]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[00:51:09.086 --> 00:51:14.410]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about the newest hydrogen technology available.
[00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.933]  GasFreedom is an affordable, practical, free energy device.
[00:51:18.493 --> 00:51:23.397]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[00:51:23.978 --> 00:51:28.581]  HHO, also called browns gas, burns efficiently and provides the energy your car needs.
[00:51:29.022 --> 00:51:31.964]  In just 10 minutes, you'll discover exactly how this is possible.
[00:51:32.364 --> 00:51:33.265]  This is the secret the oil
[00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:40.730]  I think so.
[00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:07.975]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:08.355 --> 00:52:10.316]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.997 --> 00:52:12.017]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:12.538 --> 00:52:13.058]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:13.338 --> 00:52:14.259]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:14.279 --> 00:52:15.680]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.361]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:24.446]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.846 --> 00:52:25.287]  Some U.S.
[00:52:25.327 --> 00:52:30.971]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:31.671 --> 00:52:35.154]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:35.174 --> 00:52:37.976]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:01.721 --> 00:53:04.983]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:53:05.163 --> 00:53:09.226]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:53:09.426 --> 00:53:20.853]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:53:21.073 --> 00:53:26.897]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:53:26.977 --> 00:53:27.317]  I think so.
[00:53:50.094 --> 00:53:51.115]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913
[00:54:18.627 --> 00:54:27.694]  We're gonna do something new around here to raise funds for the new TV studio we're building out here.
[00:54:27.754 --> 00:54:31.577]  I'm gonna shell off something I've never done.
[00:54:31.597 --> 00:54:33.098]  InfoWars memorabilia.
[00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:50.185]  This is a first of a kind.
[00:54:50.746 --> 00:54:57.048]  Buy this evening for $1,500 opening auction on eBay.
[00:54:57.068 --> 00:54:59.209]  We'll have an InfoWars account.
[00:54:59.249 --> 00:55:03.290]  It'll be linked up on InfoWars.com by 6 o'clock central.
[00:55:04.691 --> 00:55:07.552]  This is the bullhorn that I've had for about six years.
[00:55:08.872 --> 00:55:11.613]  This is in the film, A Scanner Darkly.
[00:55:12.113 --> 00:55:13.914]  I use my own bullhorn in the film.
[00:55:15.265 --> 00:55:27.165]  It was broken in Scanner Darkly when I was doing stunts with the SWAT team cops tackling me in scene after scene with Keanu Reeves and we had it fixed.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:35.923]  And then in Denver this year, you see the MSNBC staff assault it with a knife.
[00:55:35.983 --> 00:55:38.464]  They grab it out of my hands and cut it.
[00:55:38.524 --> 00:55:40.825]  We're going to link that video up on YouTube.
[00:55:41.345 --> 00:55:45.347]  And you can even see the cut where they sliced it 90% through right there.
[00:55:45.907 --> 00:55:46.947]  You're welcome to buy it.
[00:55:47.027 --> 00:55:47.848]  I'm going to sign it.
[00:55:48.874 --> 00:55:53.156]  You're welcome to fix it if you want or leave it broken, but this has been through the wars.
[00:55:53.196 --> 00:55:55.398]  I had one other megaphone before this over the years.
[00:55:55.438 --> 00:55:57.279]  I found this to be the best model from Radio Shack.
[00:55:57.759 --> 00:56:03.302]  We now have two replacements, but this is the most heavily action megaphone I've had.
[00:56:04.102 --> 00:56:08.345]  This sucker has been through the wars and is in the film A Scanner Darkly.
[00:56:08.925 --> 00:56:11.186]  Fifteen hundred dollars and it will be used.
[00:56:11.526 --> 00:56:12.087]  That's nothing.
[00:56:12.387 --> 00:56:12.907]  That's nothing.
[00:56:13.547 --> 00:56:17.990]  It's going to cost another hundred grand to finish the other studio we're going to have out there, and that's doing it on the cheaps.
[00:56:19.039 --> 00:56:25.645]  So instead of just getting up here and saying send me donations or buy my books and videos to fund it, which is also another way to do it, here it is ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:27.406 --> 00:56:37.315]  And so we'll also get this video up on YouTube so we can link to that so that everybody can see what they're bidding on.
[00:56:38.035 --> 00:56:39.677]  And let's have, I don't really know much about eBay.
[00:56:39.697 --> 00:56:41.058]  We can do a couple days right on the bidding.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:44.441]  It's one week?
[00:56:45.652 --> 00:56:46.012]  Standard.
[00:56:46.032 --> 00:56:49.633]  So we'll do a week-long bidding process on this.
[00:56:49.673 --> 00:56:59.395]  It'll be up by tonight and then soon after we'll add to the page some YouTube videos of this and maybe even a link to Scanner Darkly where you can see this bad boy in action.
[00:56:59.835 --> 00:57:01.416]  So, I never gave it a name.
[00:57:02.616 --> 00:57:03.816]  Call it Taranty Crusher 1.
[00:57:04.236 --> 00:57:05.396]  Here we go.
[00:57:07.437 --> 00:57:11.058]  And again, it doesn't work because it was sliced by MSNBC.
[00:57:11.438 --> 00:57:11.978]  All on video.
[00:57:14.332 --> 00:57:18.654]  And we'll also link to that video that Rob edited together of the footage of them assaulting us.
[00:57:19.334 --> 00:57:23.596]  And then of course, we got, we are changed there within 20 minutes with two bullhorns.
[00:57:23.636 --> 00:57:32.059]  We put Luke Rudowsky up on this huge guy's shoulders, like 6'7", big NFL type build, linebacker build, or I'd say lineman build.
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:35.981]  And then they were trying to grab at that huge bullhorn and trying to rip it down.
[00:57:36.001 --> 00:57:39.863]  And then I had this mega bullhorn people had to carry with a headset bullhorning.
[00:57:40.143 --> 00:57:42.244]  Totally took over MSNBC.
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:51.975]  If you're listening on the radio at InfoWars.com, I'm talking about visual things here because we're also now simulcasting the last two hours of the show every single day.
[00:57:53.404 --> 00:57:59.908]  Now, coming up after the break, let's go ahead and give folks a shot of our guests that are here in studio.
[00:58:00.909 --> 00:58:04.431]  We have Barry Cooper and his wife, Candy.
[00:58:04.451 --> 00:58:12.435]  I don't think I have time to set up another mic because I thought it was just you, but hopefully we'll be able to hear from her as well here on air.
[00:58:13.996 --> 00:58:17.459]  He goes out there and runs these stings on police with you, and has a lot of courage.
[00:58:17.479 --> 00:58:29.149]  Of course, you're a former narcotics officer yourself, and of the thousands out there fighting police corruption and trying to end some of the drug prohibition that's going on that's destroying our nation, you're the best known.
[00:58:29.169 --> 00:58:32.212]  You're also a filmmaker, so we have a lot in common.
[00:58:32.552 --> 00:58:35.094]  It is good to have him here with us in studio.
[00:58:35.494 --> 00:58:39.578]  We'll start the fourth hour when we come back in 70 seconds at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:43.001 --> 00:58:44.142]  Thank you for listening
[00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:03.239]  The late great USA, America, freedom to fascism.
[00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:10.446]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:59:48.174 --> 00:59:49.976]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.663 --> 01:00:23.664]  You know, I saw this video a few months ago.
[01:00:23.684 --> 01:00:24.785]  Somebody mailed me a copy.
[01:00:26.025 --> 01:00:29.166]  And I should have gotten it in the InfoWars.com shopping cart.
[01:00:29.186 --> 01:00:39.170]  I want to talk before you leave today about getting these in bulk from you and selling them on our online video bookstore because this is right along the lines of everything we do here fighting tyranny and corruption.
[01:00:40.651 --> 01:00:42.052]  It's Never Get Busted.
[01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:43.972]  Barry Cooper's Never Get Busted again.
[01:00:44.412 --> 01:00:45.413]  NeverGetBusted.com.
[01:00:45.673 --> 01:00:47.934]  And we're going to put that up on site.
[01:00:49.335 --> 01:00:50.275]  I'm on the screen for you.
[01:00:51.516 --> 01:00:52.656]  You have done so much.
[01:00:52.676 --> 01:01:08.939]  I think the best way to start is tell our listeners a little bit about yourself, your career in law enforcement, why you got disillusioned, and then some of the amazing exploits for freedom and liberty that you and many other officers, by the way, are out there now exposing corruption.
[01:01:08.959 --> 01:01:10.320]  So it's great to have you here with us.
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.140]  Hey, thanks.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.280]  It's great to be here.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.540]  Beautiful studio.
[01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:15.461]  To answer the questions,
[01:01:16.908 --> 01:01:22.391]  I was eight years a narcotics officer in West Texas and East Texas.
[01:01:22.951 --> 01:01:27.833]  My bosses in recent interviews called me one of the top narcotics officers in the nation.
[01:01:28.854 --> 01:01:32.736]  I don't believe that, but I'll take that if that's what I need to get people to listen.
[01:01:33.696 --> 01:01:37.498]  I was involved in over 100 search warrants.
[01:01:38.599 --> 01:01:42.160]  I personally arrested over 800 people for drugs.
[01:01:43.061 --> 01:01:45.222]  I seized numerous autos and
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.200]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.
[01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:53.021]  I worked joint operations with the FBI, the DEA, U.S.
[01:01:53.081 --> 01:01:54.422]  Border Patrol, and U.S.
[01:01:54.482 --> 01:01:55.082]  military.
[01:01:55.642 --> 01:01:59.603]  There's not any part of the drug scene in America that I didn't see.
[01:02:00.343 --> 01:02:09.305]  I got disillusioned with the drug war, and years later, I realized that the harms the drug war was causing
[01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:19.258]  was more harm than the drugs themselves and I was involved in some of the corruption and I did what every man supposed to do and that's to fix your errors.
[01:02:19.498 --> 01:02:35.352]  So I released these two videos two years ago I released one last year we released the other one and I teach all the secrets that our government taught me how to put good citizens in a cage and I teach how to counter
[01:02:36.092 --> 01:02:39.773]  Those those measures that they use against citizens.
[01:02:41.153 --> 01:02:49.916]  Coming off the success of that, Candy and I were in one of our CEO board meetings, which consists of us in our bedroom pillow talking.
[01:02:50.956 --> 01:02:54.377]  And Candy said, you know, actually I was I was crying.
[01:02:54.949 --> 01:02:56.610]  Because of all the lives I had ruined.
[01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:57.730]  And I've got a nice family.
[01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:58.590]  I've got four kids.
[01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:01.811]  16-year-old daughter starts Austin Community College.
[01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:04.732]  So we're big on family and education.
[01:03:04.772 --> 01:03:05.012]  That's right.
[01:03:05.032 --> 01:03:05.793]  You're an Austinite.
[01:03:05.893 --> 01:03:06.433]  Yes, yes.
[01:03:06.473 --> 01:03:11.814]  We just moved to Austin five months ago to launch Copbusters.
[01:03:12.395 --> 01:03:14.355]  And you worked in Texas before in your career.
[01:03:14.615 --> 01:03:15.036]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:15.136 --> 01:03:15.936]  Out in Odessa.
[01:03:17.076 --> 01:03:21.698]  Well, let's first get into how you got disillusioned, how you woke up to what's happening.
[01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:35.424]  I mean, there's the basic facts out there for folks to be aware of that the drug war just gets bigger and bigger and more drugs are on the streets and we've gone from less than a million in prison to over four million in prison and millions on parole.
[01:03:35.484 --> 01:03:37.024]  It just gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:03:37.825 --> 01:03:38.225]  That's right.
[01:03:38.285 --> 01:03:45.588]  Even the DEA will admit that we have more people in jail than ever before for drugs, yet we have more drugs on the street
[01:03:45.987 --> 01:03:49.130]  that are more potent than ever before at a cheaper price.
[01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:56.437]  So the drug war has failed to the tune of placing good human beings, millions, in a cage.
[01:03:56.857 --> 01:04:02.883]  You know every 38 seconds somebody in America gets placed in a cage for pot crimes.
[01:04:03.897 --> 01:04:15.121]  So we're fighting that, and we wanted to expose the corruption in the drug war because our email box stayed slammed with people saying, please help me, there are corrupt cops in my town.
[01:04:16.062 --> 01:04:21.884]  So Candy said, honey, why don't you, you know, you were good at busting citizens, why don't you start stinging the cops?
[01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:22.804]  So it was her idea.
[01:04:22.864 --> 01:04:23.785]  Yes, her idea.
[01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:27.606]  Six months later, we had our first cop stung in Odessa.
[01:04:27.646 --> 01:04:29.187]  We set a trap for them and it worked.
[01:04:29.767 --> 01:04:37.392]  I want to come back in a long segment and talk more about those stings and one recently that made international news that you ran and how you did those.
[01:04:37.432 --> 01:04:59.027]  I mean I should have had you in here for two or three hours but the good news is you live in Austin and so I'd like to have you in every month or so to give us reports on the latest stuff you're doing because this is just so exciting and we can spend 10 hours just all the riveting stories of these stings that you've run and of course the films that you've made about it and how the public can protect themselves under the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:04:59.327 --> 01:04:59.667]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.728 --> 01:05:04.670]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:10.092]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:05:10.353 --> 01:05:15.755]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:05:16.056 --> 01:05:17.196]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:17.556 --> 01:05:26.461]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:05:26.861 --> 01:05:28.483]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:05:28.703 --> 01:05:32.887]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:05:32.927 --> 01:05:37.532]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:05:37.932 --> 01:05:39.594]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:05:41.776 --> 01:05:42.556]  Keep it natural.
[01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:51.000]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.

[01:05:57.302 --> 01:06:00.423]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:06:01.544 --> 01:06:07.946]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:08.306 --> 01:06:09.987]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:10.942 --> 01:06:11.962]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:12.482 --> 01:06:12.983]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:13.283 --> 01:06:14.263]  This is his M.O.
[01:06:14.283 --> 01:06:15.643]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:15.663 --> 01:06:17.304]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:17.644 --> 01:06:24.386]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:24.786 --> 01:06:25.226]  Some U.S.
[01:06:25.266 --> 01:06:30.948]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:31.608 --> 01:06:35.109]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:35.129 --> 01:06:38.150]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:02.591 --> 01:07:03.732]  Hello, I'm Steve Schenck.
[01:07:04.372 --> 01:07:07.674]  Many have been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election.
[01:07:08.194 --> 01:07:14.718]  The inauguration, not the election, is the deadline given by the Obama insiders for completing your food supplies.
[01:07:15.418 --> 01:07:27.224]  Joe Biden and Colin Powell both stated that shortly after the inauguration, possibly the 21st or 22nd of January, the new president would be forced by an international incident to make some unpopular decisions.
[01:07:28.205 --> 01:07:32.087]  This functions as an important deadline for getting any food you intend to have.
[01:07:32.714 --> 01:07:39.799]  The unpopular presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of transportation and availability of food distribution.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:45.764]  Order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before the inauguration to allow for shipping.
[01:07:46.384 --> 01:07:50.407]  Late orders cannot be guaranteed delivery by this deadline for disaster.
[01:07:50.928 --> 01:07:52.289]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[01:08:02.941 --> 01:08:08.970]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.571 --> 01:08:12.556]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.007 --> 01:08:32.411]  Barry Cooper, NeverGetBusted.com, Copbusters, and his wife, who is part of the dynamic duo, Candy.
[01:08:33.372 --> 01:08:43.758]  Again, in the time we have, go back to why you were crying, why you were upset, why you were feeling bad about what you were involved with, what that basic corruption was, and then boil down some of those stings.
[01:08:44.499 --> 01:08:53.685]  I was upset and crying because I've got four kids that I see every day and we're big on family, and then I remember the look
[01:08:54.816 --> 01:09:22.315]  of kids on these raids that I was involved in kicking in doors at three o'clock in the morning after throwing in a flash grenade and mom and dad screaming and we're screwing pistols into their ears and the kids are screaming and then we haul the kids off to Department of Human Services and I remember those kids crying and then you know that didn't go away just because I left that house that person's marked forever with that terror and I I was on the
[01:09:22.757 --> 01:09:23.137]  I have some
[01:09:42.913 --> 01:09:48.602]  Bring me pot and say here smoke this and I would smoke that and not want the alcohol any longer.
[01:09:48.642 --> 01:09:56.854]  And that's why a lot of officers just interrupt end up being alcoholics the highest statistic in that profession because it is a stressful crazy job.
[01:09:57.574 --> 01:09:58.375]  Yeah, it's horrible.
[01:09:58.535 --> 01:10:00.736]  But that's not an excuse either, you know.
[01:10:01.156 --> 01:10:05.219]  But my point is, candy helped me get off the alcohol and I started smoking pot.
[01:10:05.299 --> 01:10:06.420]  So marijuana helped you?
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.040]  Helped me.
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:09.262]  It does something for me.
[01:10:10.002 --> 01:10:18.068]  It made me a more compassionate person and I stopped and slowed down long enough to realize the harms that I was creating on this earth instead of helping.
[01:10:18.493 --> 01:10:20.334]  Plus he was much nicer when he smoked.
[01:10:22.895 --> 01:10:24.315]  So I married my pot dealer.
[01:10:27.537 --> 01:10:33.519]  And then I got on the internet and I started reading the statistics and what was really happening with this drug war.
[01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:41.004]  And I started remembering back to the corruption I was involved in, planning drugs on people, lying on search warrants, stealing money.
[01:10:41.024 --> 01:10:41.865]  And that's standard now.
[01:10:41.885 --> 01:10:42.545]  That's standard now.
[01:10:42.565 --> 01:10:54.214]  I mean, not just Tulia, Texas, planning cocaine on 50 plus black people, not just Houston framing more than 4,000 people, Houston Chronicle, not just the FBI crime lab saying it was standard just to frame everybody.
[01:10:54.694 --> 01:10:57.456]  I mean, this is the norm, not the exception.
[01:10:57.657 --> 01:10:58.757]  That's exactly right.
[01:10:59.198 --> 01:11:00.379]  How did they induct you into that?
[01:11:01.369 --> 01:11:07.212]  I believed what I was doing was right when I was planning the drugs and lying on search warrants.
[01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:11.855]  Because my parents raised me, anybody that does drugs is evil.
[01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:15.256]  And the school reinforced that when I went to school.
[01:11:15.636 --> 01:11:18.398]  But it's okay to drink vodka or take Prozac.
[01:11:18.718 --> 01:11:19.119]  It's not.
[01:11:19.299 --> 01:11:20.520]  It's better to smoke pot.
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.101]  But exactly.
[01:11:21.141 --> 01:11:28.029]  I'm saying they push all these really dangerous drugs but then go after marijuana because that's 86% of people that use drugs only use that.
[01:11:28.089 --> 01:11:29.251]  Without that, their drug war is over.
[01:11:29.271 --> 01:11:29.711]  But go ahead.
[01:11:29.731 --> 01:11:30.092]  That's right.
[01:11:30.112 --> 01:11:31.053]  You're exactly right.
[01:11:31.413 --> 01:11:32.855]  And the church reinforced it.
[01:11:32.895 --> 01:11:33.936]  You know, went to church and
[01:11:34.677 --> 01:11:43.061]  And so by the time I was a young man and the government got a hold of me in the police academy, they even reinforced those beliefs more.
[01:11:43.601 --> 01:11:46.542]  So I believed that I was serving the greater good.
[01:11:46.622 --> 01:11:52.484]  I didn't realize that breaking constitutional law and taking freedoms away from people was causing more harm.
[01:11:52.925 --> 01:11:58.147]  I really believed at the time that all the corruption I was involved in was helping
[01:11:59.067 --> 01:12:26.810]  uh... helping the the movement and that was to get drugs out of america ronald reagan was one of my heroes you know kevin booth i sell his film the drug war film that proves ronald reagan was involved in the in smuggling the cocaine you know i was arresting people of ronald reagan crack in their pockets and it's just kind of the the oz the oz screen fell and what i thought was this big powerful american voice turned out to be a little bald-headed
[01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:36.756]  Well, you know, the British 160 years ago used opium importation to take control of China instead of a police state and then overthrow it.
[01:12:36.776 --> 01:12:43.580]  So this is really a formula to bring down a nation as a pretext to bring in the military, which they now use in drug interdiction inside the country.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:44.621]  Well, it's worked.
[01:12:44.921 --> 01:12:46.522]  Look where our country is right now.
[01:12:46.602 --> 01:12:49.984]  They're successful at scaring the American people.
[01:12:51.665 --> 01:12:57.288]  And hopefully our efforts will help fix some of that by exposing these cops on camera.
[01:12:58.388 --> 01:12:59.049]  Absolutely.
[01:12:59.369 --> 01:13:10.319]  You know what, if you guys don't have somewhere to go in 45 minutes, we're live on the radio, the shortwave, everywhere, but we'll be just PrisonPlanet.tv and internet, but then that gets ripped to the web and millions see it in the aggregate.
[01:13:10.579 --> 01:13:16.164]  Maybe we can do 15-20 minutes into overdrive so we have plenty of time to cover all this and play some video clips from your film.
[01:13:16.345 --> 01:13:17.205]  We'd love to stay.
[01:13:17.225 --> 01:13:17.686]  We're honored.
[01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:20.108]  I mean, I thought you lived in North Texas.
[01:13:20.128 --> 01:13:23.151]  I'm glad to hear you're in Austin now, because I'm a big fan of what you're doing.
[01:13:23.311 --> 01:13:23.711]  Okay, great.
[01:13:23.731 --> 01:13:24.872]  We're big fans of yours.
[01:13:25.293 --> 01:13:31.217]  Our email box is full of people saying you've got to get on the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[01:13:31.257 --> 01:13:33.159]  And we don't solicit our own interviews.
[01:13:33.619 --> 01:13:34.420]  We have done two.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.342]  But it's good that we ended up contacting you, so that was synchronicity.
[01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:38.403]  Oh, it was great.
[01:13:38.543 --> 01:13:39.944]  That was great, Alex.
[01:13:39.984 --> 01:13:40.505]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:13:40.525 --> 01:13:40.705]  Okay.
[01:13:40.945 --> 01:13:43.707]  Now, I mean, there's so much to talk about here.
[01:13:45.589 --> 01:13:49.350]  On the screen we were showing video of you up in a helicopter over pot fields.
[01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:49.910]  What was that?
[01:13:50.470 --> 01:14:00.573]  Well, Candy is our public relations manager and she got a call actually two days before she got the call from Channel 33 News.
[01:14:00.613 --> 01:14:10.275]  We were pillow talking having another one of our meetings and I said our second film, Never Get Rated, we got to teach people how to grow pot and sell pot and not get busted.
[01:14:11.275 --> 01:14:14.557]  Liquor dealers are allowed to sell theirs, and they don't get raided at 3 in the morning.
[01:14:14.857 --> 01:14:22.742]  I said, well, the most expensive part of this project will be to raise the money to rent a helicopter, because I have a certificate from the DEA.
[01:14:22.762 --> 01:14:24.983]  They taught me how to fly around and spot marijuana fields.
[01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:33.789]  And I was going to fly around, find a real clandestine marijuana field, sneak the film crew in, and explain what the growers did wrong from the ground.
[01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:35.790]  For me to spot it from the air.
[01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:44.837]  Two days later, Channel 33 from Dallas called Candy and said, you know the DEA just busted seven huge marijuana fields on Dallas City property.
[01:14:45.197 --> 01:14:46.738]  And they're two miles through the woods.
[01:14:47.198 --> 01:14:48.980]  No reporters will go into the fields.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.361]  Do you think Barry would go up in a helicopter with us?
[01:14:51.762 --> 01:14:54.444]  We find the fields and sneak them in.
[01:14:54.504 --> 01:14:56.145]  You know, sneak us in for an interview.
[01:14:56.865 --> 01:14:57.766]  Candy said, well of course.
[01:14:57.866 --> 01:14:59.607]  I'll call you right back.
[01:15:01.008 --> 01:15:04.890]  And so within a week, we were in the helicopter.
[01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:07.732]  I snuck, Candy and I snuck the film crew in.
[01:15:07.772 --> 01:15:10.113]  They got their interview for Channel 33.
[01:15:10.793 --> 01:15:13.394]  And then I remembered where the patch was from the air.
[01:15:14.155 --> 01:15:17.697]  So when we were finished with that, we snuck our film crew back in.
[01:15:17.777 --> 01:15:23.099]  And that's where I give the instructions that you see right now on how not to get busted for growing pot.
[01:15:23.459 --> 01:15:26.261]  And that was a field the DEA had busted a week before.
[01:15:27.415 --> 01:15:29.617]  Amazing, and the film's just full of stuff like that.
[01:15:31.458 --> 01:15:35.881]  How do police officers, that are still narcotics officers, how do they, on average, respond to you?
[01:15:35.901 --> 01:15:43.546]  I know there's thousands and thousands of police that have joined an organization that is, you know, former narcotics officers against prohibition.
[01:15:43.846 --> 01:15:54.133]  Yes, LEAP.cc, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, 6,500 politicians, judges, and police are saying the same thing to end the drug war.
[01:15:54.693 --> 01:16:08.560]  To answer your question, we get death threats from police, usually through emails, and I've kept those filed away safely, but they've emailed us horrible things such as, I hope, candy,
[01:16:10.121 --> 01:16:18.507]  gets raped while you're in prison for releasing those films and I'll see you on the shoulder if you ever come through my jurisdiction.
[01:16:19.347 --> 01:16:22.409]  So they're not happy about it and which is unfortunate.
[01:16:22.429 --> 01:16:33.317]  Because subconsciously they have a lot of guilt and so they need to keep the facade going of what they've done when it's a CIA aircraft last year crashed with three and a half tons of pure cocaine meaning coming from source folks
[01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:35.378]  They're caught all the time.
[01:16:36.098 --> 01:16:37.678]  They ship the majority of the drugs in.
[01:16:37.738 --> 01:16:41.540]  The drug war internationally is only against cowboys that don't launder their money with them.
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:52.643]  The head of the New York Stock Exchange back in 1999 flew to Colombia and met on TV with the head of the FARC and said, invest your drug money with us or we're going to invade your country.
[01:16:52.963 --> 01:16:57.625]  There's an international loophole where drug money internationally is allowed to be invested in U.S.
[01:16:57.685 --> 01:16:57.965]  banks.
[01:16:58.605 --> 01:17:00.587]  That's how open their drug dealing is.
[01:17:00.667 --> 01:17:04.651]  They ship it in, but that isn't enough to keep it illegal so they get big profits.
[01:17:05.392 --> 01:17:09.476]  Then, they get all the incredible profits on the ground in the name of fighting the drugs.
[01:17:09.536 --> 01:17:11.197]  And police, you can't deny that anymore.
[01:17:11.557 --> 01:17:14.340]  I mean, it's been in Esquire Magazine, it's been on ABC News.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:18.504]  I mean, it's on record that the majority of narcotics are shipped in here by the federal government.
[01:17:18.564 --> 01:17:33.327]  That's right and we spend 90 billion dollars a year now in this war on drugs and they still are using the propaganda to make us believe that this country will go crazy if we legalize the drugs when the truth is we give millions
[01:17:33.928 --> 01:17:34.388]  I don't know.
[01:17:51.838 --> 01:17:53.499]  That just came out in 2008.
[01:17:53.719 --> 01:17:58.202]  100 million people are now on serotonin reuptake inhibitors or Prozac class alone.
[01:17:58.683 --> 01:18:00.824]  100 million on the insert of that drug.
[01:18:01.104 --> 01:18:10.410]  It says it's in the hallucinogen psychotropic class and puts you into a dream state and is highly toxic to the brain and body and creates psychotic breaks, suicidal tendencies.
[01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:13.352]  It's all in the literature that comes with the drug.
[01:18:13.632 --> 01:18:15.574]  Meanwhile, no one dies of marijuana.
[01:18:15.594 --> 01:18:16.294]  That's right.
[01:18:16.494 --> 01:18:17.695]  And by the way, folks, I'm not some
[01:18:17.995 --> 01:18:18.255]  Marijuana.
[01:18:35.612 --> 01:18:56.246]  By opiates, by speed, by cocaine, Coca-Cola had cocaine in it, and we had about one-tenth, and you can go look at the statistics of Americans using those drugs that are now, by making it illegal, it makes it taboo, makes it profitable, just like alcoholism tripled under the ten years of prohibition back in the twenties, and energized the mafia, corrupted the police,
[01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:58.627]  The very same drug dealers.
[01:18:58.847 --> 01:19:05.271]  Skull and Bones is run by the British Yersinia Company, that's Mainline News, founded by that company that had the world opium monopoly.
[01:19:05.651 --> 01:19:09.913]  By the 20s they'd lost their world monopoly and the papers are now declassified.
[01:19:09.973 --> 01:19:18.918]  They lobbied to make drugs illegal so they could jack up the price several thousand percentage points and then use it to corrupt police on top of their profits.
[01:19:19.198 --> 01:19:20.999]  Because they'd done that, again,
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.662]  Then 80 years before in China.
[01:19:24.682 --> 01:19:25.882]  And I know I keep going back to that.
[01:19:26.163 --> 01:19:27.143]  This is a program.
[01:19:27.403 --> 01:19:31.466]  It is and it's sad because we forget about our prisoners.
[01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:36.089]  Listen, to go into a cage, pretend like you're snatched right now into a cage.
[01:19:36.529 --> 01:19:39.671]  The concrete floors in those prisons and jails
[01:19:40.191 --> 01:19:42.072]  They've been urinated on so much.
[01:19:42.473 --> 01:19:44.013]  The urine smells there.
[01:19:44.094 --> 01:19:45.094]  The food is horrible.
[01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:46.095]  You get a bologna sandwich.
[01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.276]  And it's a college of crime.
[01:19:47.336 --> 01:19:47.656]  Stay there.
[01:19:47.676 --> 01:19:49.297]  We're going to come back and get more into this.
[01:19:49.657 --> 01:19:52.099]  We're going to go into overdrive today, folks, for a half hour.
[01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:56.921]  So for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and internet listeners at InfoWars.com, the show will continue.
[01:19:57.142 --> 01:19:58.903]  For our huge AM and FM audience, everybody yells.

[01:20:00.063 --> 01:20:00.524]  Stay with us.
[01:20:02.372 --> 01:20:06.196]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.

[01:20:38.408 --> 01:20:41.211]  Preparing the whole family has never been so affordable.
[01:20:41.411 --> 01:20:45.134]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:20:45.154 --> 01:20:45.715]  And we knew what to do.
[01:21:09.377 --> 01:21:10.398]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:21:10.639 --> 01:21:17.068]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.

[01:21:33.668 --> 01:21:36.729]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.

[01:23:51.687 --> 01:23:52.247]  And boys, we know.
[01:24:17.441 --> 01:24:24.492]  I am a Midwest farmer.
[01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:26.675]  I make a living off the land.
[01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:45.904]  Barry Cooper's Never Get Busted Again, Volume 2, Never Get Raided, former top narcotics officer, over 800 felony misdemeanor narcotics arrest, former K-9 instructor, trained by the DEA.
[01:24:47.606 --> 01:24:48.407]  Here's volume one.
[01:24:48.447 --> 01:24:49.269]  Traffic stops.
[01:24:49.349 --> 01:24:54.936]  Barry Cooper is a hero because he is standing up and declaring the war on drugs is not working.
[01:24:54.996 --> 01:24:56.178]  This is Tucker Carlson, MSNBC.
[01:24:59.753 --> 01:25:01.034]  We're going to go into overdrive today.
[01:25:01.054 --> 01:25:07.978]  I have an additional bonus 30 minutes for everybody viewing and listening when the main radio show ends in about 35 minutes.
[01:25:08.018 --> 01:25:10.800]  But I wanted to go ahead now and play the trailer.
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:11.640]  I forget which one.
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.801]  Which trailer are we about to play?
[01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:15.723]  It should be the trailer to Copbusters Episode 1.
[01:25:16.523 --> 01:25:16.763]  Okay.
[01:25:16.983 --> 01:25:18.624]  It's on copbusters.com.
[01:25:18.845 --> 01:25:19.145]  Okay.
[01:25:19.465 --> 01:25:28.150]  So we're going to go ahead and punch that trailer up right now and play that trailer from Copbusters for everybody that is out there watching.
[01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:29.071]  Are we ready with that trailer?
[01:25:29.871 --> 01:25:33.796]  Uh, here we go.
[01:25:58.101 --> 01:26:02.684]  On June 3rd, 2005, his wife found out she'd been charged with possession of methamphetamines.
[01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:12.410]  Found out that she had been set up, that drugs had been planted on her by an informant at the behest of Officer Gregory Traven of the Odessa Police Department.
[01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:16.772]  Officer Traven took him from the Odessa Police Department over to the apartment.
[01:26:17.093 --> 01:26:20.975]  He met with Yolanda, planted drugs on Yolanda, and then Officer Traven
[01:26:21.653 --> 01:26:27.996]  Followed her to her next stop, Albertsons, and then had the police officer pull her over in Albertsons' parking lot, and that's where she was arrested.
[01:26:28.176 --> 01:26:32.418]  He testified that they told him to make sure she takes this back.
[01:26:32.878 --> 01:26:42.363]  When we call him, trying to find out what we can do about all this injustice, he's told us, me and my mother, he said, the police got the wrong person.
[01:26:42.383 --> 01:26:43.904]  They thought she was somebody else.
[01:26:44.824 --> 01:26:45.905]  But once they made the
[01:26:47.399 --> 01:26:49.440]  The bus, they had to go through with it.
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:53.161]  I mean, once you plant drugs, you can't say, oh, excuse me, we planted drugs.
[01:26:53.181 --> 01:27:01.203]  I reached out to Barry and said, look, I told him all the predicaments that we was in, Mr. Madden and I, the case, Shalonda Madden, and things that were going on.
[01:27:01.523 --> 01:27:09.946]  And I told him, there has to be some type of program, some type of entity out there that can come in and investigate these officers.
[01:27:09.966 --> 01:27:12.547]  Basically, I've, you know, I've gone through the system.
[01:27:12.767 --> 01:27:16.108]  So what, so what I had to do is I reached out to Copbusters.
[01:27:17.796 --> 01:27:40.471]  Candy and I, my wife, brought a team of detectives into Odessa to set a trap to bust crooked cops in Odessa that planted drugs on his daughter, Yolanda Madden, and she is now serving an eight-year prison sentence.
[01:27:43.933 --> 01:27:45.374]  Our attorney was inside.
[01:27:45.394 --> 01:27:47.195]  They handcuffed our attorney.
[01:27:48.041 --> 01:27:53.047]  And then when they realized nothing was illegal and they had messed up, they released our attorney.
[01:28:01.597 --> 01:28:08.885]  I'm doing this for the attention of that girl that's in prison and the million non-violent drug prisoners we have in prison right now.
[01:28:17.114 --> 01:28:25.402]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, and the police with big smirks on their faces, caught red-handed trying to engage in these activities.
[01:28:25.782 --> 01:28:32.248]  It is the norm to plant drugs, and more and more with hidden cameras people are catching police at roadside checkpoints, you name it.
[01:28:32.628 --> 01:28:37.732]  How do they morally get to the point where they think it's good to send somebody away for 5, 10, 20 years?
[01:28:38.373 --> 01:28:39.834]  Unlike the case in Tulea, Texas.
[01:28:43.577 --> 01:28:50.002]  I don't have an answer for it, except it is evil.
[01:28:50.723 --> 01:29:02.712]  And I was part of that corruption, and like I said earlier, I believed what I was doing was right, but I was a young kid, and it doesn't take much maturity and much research to learn that all that's wrong.
[01:29:03.874 --> 01:29:06.735]  All the cops doing the drug war should switch, like I did.
[01:29:06.775 --> 01:29:12.117]  We're about to break, but what was the first time that you were a narcotics officer and suddenly said, this is how we do it?
[01:29:12.137 --> 01:29:16.078]  I mean, do they teach planning drugs in the academy courses?
[01:29:16.439 --> 01:29:27.122]  They don't teach that in the academy, but when you get on the street with the training partner, if he senses that he can trust you and you're one of them, then they start showing those inside ropes.
[01:29:28.723 --> 01:29:30.224]  Of course, they don't announce posts.
[01:29:30.244 --> 01:29:32.244]  And it's a sick gang mentality culture.
[01:29:32.264 --> 01:29:34.345]  It's sick what they're doing, but it's, oh, it's a brotherhood.
[01:29:34.705 --> 01:29:38.027]  Just like the Eastside Vatos have the sick code, so do the police.
[01:29:38.067 --> 01:29:44.489]  I want to ask when we come back, what percentage of units that you worked in and around are planting drugs on people?
[01:29:45.210 --> 01:29:46.470]  I would guess it's the majority.
[01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:48.031]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:48.071 --> 01:29:50.772]  Long segment coming up, right here on GCN.
[01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:52.553]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.053 --> 01:29:54.653]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.594 --> 01:29:58.255]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.724 --> 01:30:05.366]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:30:05.426 --> 01:30:11.068]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:30:11.168 --> 01:30:15.209]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.791]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:30:17.951 --> 01:30:23.853]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:30:23.933 --> 01:30:24.433]  I don't know.
[01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:46.113]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:46.173 --> 01:30:48.114]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:11.147 --> 01:31:12.168]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:12.689 --> 01:31:13.189]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:13.490 --> 01:31:14.471]  This is his M.O.
[01:31:14.491 --> 01:31:15.812]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:15.852 --> 01:31:17.514]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:17.855 --> 01:31:24.622]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:25.003 --> 01:31:25.443]  Some U.S.
[01:31:25.483 --> 01:31:31.150]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:35.311]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:35.331 --> 01:31:38.132]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:07.237]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:32:07.437 --> 01:32:12.603]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:32:12.863 --> 01:32:17.949]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:21.814]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:32:22.094 --> 01:32:23.815]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[01:32:24.136 --> 01:32:30.140]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:33.902]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:32:34.163 --> 01:32:38.686]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:32:38.966 --> 01:32:39.747]  Do your part.
[01:32:40.027 --> 01:32:42.288]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[01:32:42.649 --> 01:32:48.773]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[01:32:49.073 --> 01:32:51.474]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.
[01:32:51.834 --> 01:32:58.036]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now, by going directly to alkavision.com.
[01:32:58.296 --> 01:33:00.396]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[01:33:05.738 --> 01:33:10.239]  Monday through Friday, from 11am to 3pm Central Standard Time.
[01:33:11.414 --> 01:33:15.398]  The Infowar has launched a new weapon in the assault against tyranny.
[01:33:15.959 --> 01:33:22.526]  The PrisonPlanet.tv live simulcast where this radio show turns into a television show.
[01:33:22.987 --> 01:33:26.691]  We've been doing this for two weeks now in the new studio, about eight months total.
[01:33:27.251 --> 01:33:30.135]  And again, the good news for all the viewers out there is it's having an effect.
[01:33:30.615 --> 01:33:38.220]  These TV programs on YouTube, every week alone from a few channels we're looking at the numbers on, over a million people tuning in and watching it.
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:44.104]  So that is something added to the two million radio listeners per show.
[01:33:45.504 --> 01:33:46.584]  And then just everything else.
[01:33:46.624 --> 01:33:53.546]  And the reason I keep plugging that is, this is exciting because we're exponentially growing and reaching new people with this information.
[01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:58.327]  And then meeting and finding new folks that have just done so many other incredible things.
[01:33:58.747 --> 01:34:02.988]  You know, I guess I'm a guy for your heart, you're a guy for my heart because these stings, these exposing things.
[01:34:03.008 --> 01:34:04.089]  I've done these on the military.
[01:34:04.409 --> 01:34:10.810]  I've done these on world leaders with satanic activities with the Bohemian Grove, which is an offshoot of Skull and Bones.
[01:34:11.250 --> 01:34:12.851]  And then I've seen one of your films.
[01:34:13.931 --> 01:34:16.292]  Just today seeing all this other footage, it's amazing.
[01:34:16.612 --> 01:34:32.199]  Now let's finish up with how this planting drugs works, answering the question of what percentage of police departments and units you believe are planting drugs, and then let's get into this latest stingy ran that made international headlines.
[01:34:32.219 --> 01:34:36.401]  85% are planting drugs would be my guess, and I'm probably under-guessing.
[01:34:38.035 --> 01:34:41.077]  And the public has no idea of this just unbelievable systemic corruption?
[01:34:41.737 --> 01:34:54.565]  The public knows, but for some reason, like my parents and grandparents trusted politicians to protect our freedoms, it seems like the younger generation have realized it's up to the citizenry to get our freedoms back.
[01:34:56.826 --> 01:34:59.988]  Now going back to the department, where were you, where were you working?
[01:35:00.208 --> 01:35:02.629]  I mean, did you immediately as an officer become a narcotics officer?
[01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:03.310]  How did that happen?
[01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:05.391]  And then what was the first time they said, let's plant drugs?
[01:35:07.423 --> 01:35:11.466]  I basically overwhelmed law enforcement pretty fast.
[01:35:11.666 --> 01:35:18.070]  I climbed, in the first year I already had my own drug dog that I was training for narcotics.
[01:35:18.591 --> 01:35:19.151]  And where was that?
[01:35:19.511 --> 01:35:21.813]  That was Big Sandy Police Department.
[01:35:21.913 --> 01:35:29.559]  I made over 100 drug arrests in a year and a half on only 5 miles of highway with my new drug dog.
[01:35:29.899 --> 01:35:34.943]  And that's what got the attention of the Permian Basin Drug Task Force out in West Texas.
[01:35:35.844 --> 01:35:46.141]  They were under the TNCP program, Texas Narcotics Control Program, and it was there at the Permian Basin Drug Task Force where I learned to do all of these corrupt things.
[01:35:46.782 --> 01:35:48.065]  And give us a case point example.
[01:35:49.794 --> 01:36:04.885]  Probably one of the things that we repeated over and over is we claimed an informant saw drugs in somebody's house and that was enough probable cause for a search warrant when the truth is an informant had never been in the house to see the drugs.
[01:36:04.925 --> 01:36:15.553]  We called it a ghost informant and we knew being on a local state level our informants did not have to show up in court and testify like they do a lot in federal court so we were protected.
[01:36:15.713 --> 01:36:17.094]  So no right to face the accuser?
[01:36:17.674 --> 01:36:22.867]  Right, we lied on the search warrants claiming a confidential informant saw the drugs when they didn't.
[01:36:23.889 --> 01:36:26.416]  And what would you do then with the drug planting?
[01:36:28.114 --> 01:36:31.535]  Most of the drug planning took place through an informant.
[01:36:32.575 --> 01:36:41.978]  We would pull over somebody on the highway and arrest them for drugs and explain to them if they did three deals for us that we wouldn't file this case.
[01:36:42.238 --> 01:36:44.979]  And the three deals means to set somebody up for drugs.
[01:36:45.719 --> 01:36:57.023]  And the informants would actually go into the house, hide the drugs in the cushion of a couch, come back out and tell us, hey, I just saw drugs in their house and we would raid it.
[01:36:57.443 --> 01:37:00.284]  The entire time the informant was the one who put the drugs in there.
[01:37:00.544 --> 01:37:01.284]  It's very common.
[01:37:01.364 --> 01:37:09.286]  And you wouldn't feel bad, I mean later you did, it was great to just go ruin somebody's life, to just go in and because we're good guys fighting drugs, planting drugs.
[01:37:09.306 --> 01:37:11.987]  I guess the excuse was we think this person is a drug dealer?
[01:37:12.407 --> 01:37:13.908]  Well they were, we couldn't catch them.
[01:37:13.968 --> 01:37:18.949]  We really believed they were a drug dealer and we couldn't catch them using the legal ways.
[01:37:19.609 --> 01:37:21.930]  So we crossed those lines and lied.
[01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:23.150]  And it's sad.
[01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:25.631]  I didn't feel bad for what I was doing then.
[01:37:26.371 --> 01:37:30.335]  Like I said, I believed I was doing the greater good, but I feel horrible about it now.
[01:37:31.357 --> 01:37:33.599]  But during that period, though, you did wake up.
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:39.025]  Yes, it was about three months before I quit law enforcement.
[01:37:39.085 --> 01:37:45.372]  I started noticing some things, and I quit law enforcement after I arrested the mayor's son with methamphetamine.
[01:37:45.828 --> 01:37:45.908]  Yeah.
[01:38:15.928 --> 01:38:17.609]  He was truly a mess about it.
[01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:30.875]  So she just kept taking the alcohol away and when I'd get home in the evening I'd go back to the bedroom and smoke a joint and it took a year or so of healing and realizing and what to do next.
[01:38:30.955 --> 01:38:31.916]  Figuring things out.
[01:38:31.956 --> 01:38:35.017]  Well that's what's so incredible though about the demonization of marijuana itself.
[01:38:35.318 --> 01:38:37.659]  The apothecaries, or who the pharmacists were,
[01:38:38.479 --> 01:38:54.015]  Going back to when people were first here in the colonies over 350 years ago, it was one of the number one prescribed things by doctors, by barbers, who were kind of like a sub-doctor or like a nurse, and by the apothecaries, and it was sold out of the Americas all over the world.
[01:38:54.816 --> 01:38:56.378]  Ships filled with hemp.
[01:38:56.618 --> 01:38:58.620]  They used the Mexican name marijuana.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:38:59.221]  Like it is now.
[01:39:00.001 --> 01:39:00.721]  Absolutely.
[01:39:01.062 --> 01:39:07.424]  And George Washington, you can read the old prescriptions from his doctor for gout and for headaches and stomach aches.
[01:39:08.425 --> 01:39:10.586]  George Washington didn't just smoke marijuana.
[01:39:11.066 --> 01:39:14.127]  On his plantation, he grew marijuana.
[01:39:14.147 --> 01:39:17.569]  Not just hemp rope, that type without THC.
[01:39:17.609 --> 01:39:19.630]  He was a big pot smoker.
[01:39:19.730 --> 01:39:21.591]  Well, I ran for Congress.
[01:39:22.091 --> 01:39:23.771]  I've done live debates.
[01:39:24.152 --> 01:39:29.174]  And if anybody thinks for a second that marijuana keeps you from being a producing individual,
[01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:31.507]  Look at me and the millions of others.
[01:39:31.928 --> 01:39:37.733]  My whole point is that in the thirties they had reefer madness saying you murder and kill people on pot.
[01:39:38.293 --> 01:39:40.936]  They made all these movies to demonize it.
[01:39:41.236 --> 01:39:44.579]  They changed the name to marijuana using the Spanish name so it sounded alien.
[01:39:45.159 --> 01:39:51.705]  And then they made something that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson smoked for toothaches in a pipe into something they put you in prison for.
[01:39:52.146 --> 01:39:52.646]  Exactly.
[01:39:53.206 --> 01:39:55.408]  And that's why copbusters and you and
[01:39:56.189 --> 01:39:57.390]  Never get busted or hear.
[01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:59.452]  It's a freedom issue.
[01:39:59.492 --> 01:40:01.033]  It's not just a pot issue.
[01:40:01.074 --> 01:40:03.676]  It's not if you think it's wrong or if I think it's wrong.
[01:40:03.696 --> 01:40:04.577]  It has nothing to do with that.
[01:40:04.597 --> 01:40:05.397]  It's a freedom issue.
[01:40:05.437 --> 01:40:06.959]  If I want to do it, I should be able to do it.
[01:40:07.039 --> 01:40:08.500]  If I'm not hurting someone else.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:09.481]  Well, exactly.
[01:40:09.541 --> 01:40:12.444]  I'm just speaking to those out there going, listen to him saying he smokes marijuana.
[01:40:12.504 --> 01:40:12.904]  It's evil.
[01:40:12.944 --> 01:40:13.605]  It's horrible.
[01:40:14.045 --> 01:40:14.465]  It's bad.
[01:40:15.106 --> 01:40:18.028]  The only reason it could be bad is because they've made it illegal.
[01:40:18.128 --> 01:40:20.690]  It's now under that culture of other illegal drugs.
[01:40:20.831 --> 01:40:23.032]  And so when you're out buying it, you don't know if it's good.
[01:40:23.072 --> 01:40:24.153]  You don't know if it's been sprayed.
[01:40:24.173 --> 01:40:25.254]  You don't know if it's tainted.
[01:40:25.674 --> 01:40:27.456]  You don't know if Paraquad's been sprayed on it.
[01:40:27.596 --> 01:40:31.079]  And then the dealer may say, I got something else for you that is really bad.
[01:40:31.559 --> 01:40:35.042]  And see, that's why we've got to decriminalize it so that it isn't in that whole culture.
[01:40:36.237 --> 01:40:46.500]  Well it certainly needs to be switched out of the culture it's in right now, because Americans are not going to stop growing it, they're not going to stop smoking it, no matter how many of us you put in jail.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.641]  And if there's one pot smoker in jail, we're all in jail.
[01:40:49.741 --> 01:40:54.002]  And then the states pass laws decriminalizing and the feds say no and swoop in and try
[01:40:54.062 --> 01:40:55.123]  Well, that's what bothers me.
[01:40:55.163 --> 01:40:56.004]  That's what bothers me.
[01:40:56.064 --> 01:41:00.268]  People say, well, you're supposed to change the laws through... Well, I ran for Congress.
[01:41:00.348 --> 01:41:01.168]  I tried that.
[01:41:01.569 --> 01:41:02.550]  And here's the problem.
[01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:04.652]  They say, change the laws the right way.
[01:41:04.712 --> 01:41:05.612]  Don't release films.
[01:41:05.673 --> 01:41:06.553]  Don't sting cops.
[01:41:06.573 --> 01:41:10.417]  Well, every time the American people bring it up on the ballot,
[01:41:10.937 --> 01:41:14.959]  For instance, they just did this in Michigan for medical marijuana.
[01:41:14.999 --> 01:41:21.881]  The cops, the chief of police are the ones that come out and say, no, we can't do this and start the marijuana madness thing again.
[01:41:22.301 --> 01:41:29.944]  So the government and the police tell us, go through the proper channels to change the law, and then when we try, they come against it.
[01:41:29.984 --> 01:41:31.745]  So it makes absolutely no sense.
[01:41:32.065 --> 01:41:32.625]  It's not fair.
[01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:35.867]  Well, we've got to start with the ending prohibition on marijuana.
[01:41:36.787 --> 01:41:39.068]  And then taxing it and controlling it like anything else.
[01:41:39.088 --> 01:41:42.009]  I don't even like them taxing it for this reason, Alex.
[01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:44.190]  But if I can get them to at least do that... No, I would take that.
[01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:51.573]  But that's still saying, we'll pay you money, American government, if you quit putting us in jail for something we shouldn't be in jail for anyway.
[01:41:51.953 --> 01:41:58.916]  They should leave that plant alone, and if they do, it will do more good for America than all the tax money it could ever bring.
[01:41:58.976 --> 01:42:01.237]  But if they want to legalize it and tax it, we'll take that.
[01:42:01.317 --> 01:42:02.778]  Well, it's an automatic tax.
[01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:05.960]  I mean, you said $90 billion a year.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:07.040]  Billion.
[01:42:07.801 --> 01:42:08.181]  Billion.
[01:42:08.521 --> 01:42:13.044]  It's already a tax cut if we stop spending that $90 billion a year.
[01:42:13.624 --> 01:42:14.425]  Yeah, good point.
[01:42:15.045 --> 01:42:18.707]  So, I mean, right there, that's $90 billion that we won't be spending.
[01:42:18.927 --> 01:42:23.650]  Now, before we run out of time here, I know we've got 30 minutes of overdrive, but for the full audience with about 18 minutes left,
[01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:31.816]  Let's get into, just in rapid fire, some of the worst cases of corruption and shut-ups you've seen, and then get into your latest sting.
[01:42:33.976 --> 01:42:59.122]  The worst cases of corruption would be those where we put people in jail when the informant planted the drugs and or we lied on the search warrant and or we caused our dog to false alert when they refused consent so we could search their car or taking an eight ball of cocaine out of my pocket as an officer and sticking it in another man's pocket that's handcuffed
[01:42:59.795 --> 01:43:19.823]  And telling him if he doesn't call me within 24 hours to set somebody else up on a drug bust, that 8 ball of cocaine was going to be his, then I would take the 8 ball of cocaine out of his pocket and put it back in mine, and within 24 hours he would call me because he was so scared that I would plant that 8 ball on him.
[01:43:21.203 --> 01:43:22.804]  Terrorizing Americans.
[01:43:23.004 --> 01:43:25.885]  Well before we get into that sting, just briefly, my story growing up.
[01:43:27.012 --> 01:43:39.538]  Growing up, by the time I was 12, I had older friends, I was playing baseball with things in the neighborhood in Dallas, middle class area, Rockwall actually, there on the lake, and I'd go over and their older brothers would be smoking pot, and I'd smoke it and wouldn't like the way it made me feel.
[01:43:41.138 --> 01:43:46.021]  So I was never really into drugs, but I saw it going on, and this was in a fluent area,
[01:43:46.821 --> 01:43:53.708]  And so at the time I was about 14, I had friends who were now 18 who I knew were suddenly driving Corvettes and having a great time.
[01:43:53.728 --> 01:43:55.170]  They were being left alone by the police.
[01:43:55.690 --> 01:44:01.436]  I'd get pulled over with them in the passenger seat and they'd go, you can go, because they knew them.
[01:44:01.997 --> 01:44:03.559]  And I would be at a party
[01:44:03.979 --> 01:44:08.783]  And I'd see a plain-clothes guy show up, and I knew these guys for so many years, they trusted me.
[01:44:09.064 --> 01:44:24.857]  Suddenly I was in the middle of this, seeing ecstasy, cocaine, LSD, marijuana, with police delivering this to teenage and then 20-year-old dealers who were running around selling this to all the yuppies and housewives in town.
[01:44:25.618 --> 01:44:27.519]  And again, by the time I was 14, I had a moped.
[01:44:27.939 --> 01:44:33.861]  I even had this one friend's older brother say, hey, just make marijuana deliveries for us right around the neighborhood.
[01:44:33.881 --> 01:44:34.762]  And I said, no, no, no.
[01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:43.525]  Then, by the time I'm 16, I'm in Rockwall High School, and the very cops I know are connected to drug dealing are in and around the school, being called into the school when there's drug busts and things.
[01:44:43.885 --> 01:44:46.326]  And I started to shoot my mouth off, going, you guys are dealing the drugs.
[01:44:46.346 --> 01:44:47.847]  You shouldn't be putting people in jail.
[01:44:48.367 --> 01:44:51.368]  And then my dad starts getting calls that we're going to hang your son in a jail cell.
[01:44:51.708 --> 01:44:52.769]  They did, and pulled me over.
[01:44:53.229 --> 01:44:55.790]  Threatened me in the car, said we're going to kill you if you don't shut up.
[01:44:56.110 --> 01:44:58.551]  And we had to move from Dallas to Austin.
[01:44:59.251 --> 01:45:01.312]  My dad said, that's it, we're out of here.
[01:45:01.332 --> 01:45:05.093]  Because suddenly cops were by my house, driving around, they were pulling me over.
[01:45:05.474 --> 01:45:08.775]  They called me into the principal's office and said, we know you've stolen all the stereo equipment.
[01:45:09.335 --> 01:45:10.296]  And I was honest with the cop.
[01:45:10.336 --> 01:45:11.437]  I said, you're really evil.
[01:45:11.477 --> 01:45:13.858]  I said, I've stolen beer out of the backs of golf carts when I was like 13.
[01:45:13.898 --> 01:45:19.303]  You know, a few times there'd be these golf carts sitting out parked at the pool by the golf course.
[01:45:19.343 --> 01:45:20.724]  And we'd go, ah, six pack!
[01:45:20.964 --> 01:45:22.105]  I go, that's all I've ever stolen.
[01:45:22.125 --> 01:45:25.807]  And once when I was three, I walked out with a candy bar and my mom made me take it back.
[01:45:26.208 --> 01:45:27.769]  I said, I haven't stolen any stereo equipment.
[01:45:27.789 --> 01:45:28.369]  I'm not a criminal.
[01:45:28.610 --> 01:45:29.570]  And he said, I know that.
[01:45:29.610 --> 01:45:34.274]  But we're going to put you in jail and big black men are going to rape you if you don't go set people up for us.
[01:45:34.714 --> 01:45:43.917]  So their way of trying to make me shut up, as all this was happening, was to try to call me in and say, big black men were going to rape me if I didn't go set people up for stealing things.
[01:45:43.997 --> 01:45:48.759]  Then they called me in right before we moved and said, you know, we know you're involved in all these other criminal activities.
[01:45:48.999 --> 01:45:50.400]  We know you're involved in arson.
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:52.000]  And I was going, whoa.
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:54.141]  And then they found out we were moving.
[01:45:54.861 --> 01:46:03.598]  And it was the last day of school, and the cop walks out to my truck, you know, the head cop, and he says, Alex, I hear you're moving to Austin.
[01:46:03.618 --> 01:46:04.058]  Doesn't matter.
[01:46:04.139 --> 01:46:04.720]  You're a criminal.
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:07.204]  We're still going to get you, and black men are still going to rape you and give you AIDS.
[01:46:08.753 --> 01:46:13.175]  And you know I've got some advice for any listeners and this is the advice we give daily.
[01:46:13.315 --> 01:46:19.618]  If you're in a jurisdiction and the cops are picking on you like they were Alex and many others, you need to leave that jurisdiction.
[01:46:19.638 --> 01:46:22.340]  You need to physically move away from that address.
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:31.424]  Candy and I fled East Texas to come to Austin because just eight months ago one of them in a park you were talking about how cops shoot people.
[01:46:31.884 --> 01:46:36.268]  Now they've got this neat thing they do and they did it to Candy and I and we're suing the department for it.
[01:46:36.648 --> 01:46:52.002]  We were walking in a park and the guy, we got into a confrontation and the cop, a very calm confrontation I might add, and the cop grabbed his pistol and started screaming, you're not going to shoot me, you're not going to shoot me.
[01:46:52.022 --> 01:46:53.183]  I thought he was going to shoot him.
[01:46:53.263 --> 01:46:58.027]  Yeah, I instantly registered that as this guy's setting things up where when he shoots me,
[01:46:59.207 --> 01:47:04.129]  It's on video and camera that he was in fear of his life, which is what the cops need before they pull the gun.
[01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:05.489]  They have to explain they're in fear of their life.
[01:47:05.529 --> 01:47:06.489]  In the threat continuum.
[01:47:06.509 --> 01:47:07.109]  Yes, yes.
[01:47:07.149 --> 01:47:11.351]  So he's already screaming, you're not going to shoot me, you're not going to shoot me.
[01:47:11.411 --> 01:47:15.152]  That way, if he had to shoot me on the video, it's like, man, I was scared.
[01:47:15.172 --> 01:47:16.172]  I thought he was going to shoot me.
[01:47:16.192 --> 01:47:18.793]  Because it was night and I had a cell phone, you know.
[01:47:18.833 --> 01:47:20.093]  That's what they're saying now.
[01:47:20.193 --> 01:47:20.613]  Oh, it's crazy.
[01:47:23.234 --> 01:47:24.175]  We thought he was going to do something.
[01:47:24.195 --> 01:47:25.415]  They put out a false story.
[01:47:25.495 --> 01:47:26.956]  So we moved to Austin.
[01:47:26.996 --> 01:47:29.417]  It's safer here than other areas of Texas.
[01:47:29.477 --> 01:47:30.237]  I know the police chief.
[01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:32.058]  He's actually going to be in here in two weeks in the studio.
[01:47:32.178 --> 01:47:36.059]  Well, he's got a problem with taking blood from people on these DWIs.
[01:47:36.099 --> 01:47:36.940]  I brought that up to him.
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:38.220]  He's got to quit that.
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:42.302]  But he at least is kicking cops off, which other departments won't, who are shooting people in the back.
[01:47:42.802 --> 01:47:43.623]  That's his reasonable service.
[01:47:43.663 --> 01:47:45.404]  He's supposed to kick cops off that shoot people.
[01:47:45.424 --> 01:47:49.947]  But holding people down like they've been doing through the holidays here in Austin
[01:47:59.133 --> 01:48:04.016]  With a search warrant to pull their blood from them is craziness.
[01:48:04.116 --> 01:48:05.657]  Oh, no, I agree.
[01:48:05.677 --> 01:48:07.358]  And I saw the chief on... Oh, I know.
[01:48:07.458 --> 01:48:08.299]  I didn't think that.
[01:48:08.639 --> 01:48:10.140]  But I do take issue with that.
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:14.522]  I saw him on the news the other day proudly exclaiming and proclaiming, you know what?
[01:48:14.743 --> 01:48:15.143]  I hate...
[01:48:21.345 --> 01:48:27.327]  Absolutely, and those that claim, you know, give us your liberty for security, they always want to set up tyranny.
[01:48:27.387 --> 01:48:38.690]  And just finishing the story about Rockwall briefly, right before we moved, the sheriff, and I wouldn't have any trouble with them, it was the APD, or it was the Rockwall PD, it was the city,
[01:48:39.847 --> 01:48:43.773]  Got caught by the Feds flying cocaine and marijuana into the Rockwall Municipal Airport.
[01:48:44.033 --> 01:48:48.881]  So it turned out it was a huge drug dealing operation to all those wealthy people in that bedroom community.
[01:48:49.542 --> 01:48:53.007]  And just because I shot my mouth off a few times, that concerned them.
[01:48:54.008 --> 01:48:55.070]  And they were getting ready to kill me.
[01:48:55.902 --> 01:49:04.025]  Because then my dad had one of the city lawyers who he'd known back from college days call him up and say, get your family out of here now.
[01:49:04.385 --> 01:49:05.145]  That's all I'm going to tell you.
[01:49:05.225 --> 01:49:09.247]  Get out of here now or your son's going to be hung in a cell when we'd already had that phone call.
[01:49:09.787 --> 01:49:18.670]  And then I had him pull me over, say you're drinking while driving, wasn't drinking, put me in the car, took me to the Rockwall jail cell when I was 16 and said,
[01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:21.152]  That they would kill me if I didn't shut up.
[01:49:21.632 --> 01:49:22.593]  Now that's American.
[01:49:22.613 --> 01:49:22.854]  That's scary.
[01:49:22.874 --> 01:49:25.116]  Well fortunately, yeah, fortunately you got away.
[01:49:25.156 --> 01:49:30.262]  Yolanda Madden and hundreds of thousands of others in this country didn't get away.
[01:49:30.703 --> 01:49:35.368]  And we're not going to stop until we see some prison doors come loose.
[01:49:35.489 --> 01:49:35.749]  Right.
[01:49:36.630 --> 01:49:38.292]  Well this is just an unbelievable interview.
[01:49:38.712 --> 01:49:39.774]  Tell us about the latest thing.
[01:49:41.229 --> 01:49:53.303]  Um, we were planning to go to Washington State where we, I have proof and evidence that the cops there are raiding marijuana grow rooms using illegal FLIR cameras, the heat imaging cameras.
[01:49:54.044 --> 01:49:57.388]  So we set a, uh, we were going to do that in Washington State.
[01:49:57.850 --> 01:50:06.518]  We had a group targeted and I got a phone call from a citizen in Odessa that told me my ex-partners had planted drugs on his daughter and wanted to know if I could help.
[01:50:06.678 --> 01:50:12.123]  So Candy and I switched operations and we rented a house in Odessa.
[01:50:12.404 --> 01:50:18.770]  We hired investigators to do surveillance and various other things that we needed before we set the trap.
[01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:28.242]  We rented a house in Odessa and we placed one grow light in the room with two Christmas trees and we started pumping the heat out of the wall.
[01:50:28.883 --> 01:50:35.272]  Now never get rated my second video I have an entire chapter dedicated how to beat the flare cameras.
[01:50:35.892 --> 01:50:39.213]  And one of the tips there is do not pump the heat out of your wall.
[01:50:39.653 --> 01:50:42.914]  Because the cops drive by with these illegal FLIR cameras.
[01:50:42.974 --> 01:50:44.475]  They see the port, they see the heat.
[01:50:44.635 --> 01:50:45.455]  Yeah, they see the heat.
[01:50:45.475 --> 01:50:49.536]  And the Supreme Court has ruled those FLIR cameras are illegal to use unless you have a search warrant.
[01:50:50.077 --> 01:50:52.457]  They weren't illegal to use when I was a cop.
[01:50:52.577 --> 01:50:53.418]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:50:53.498 --> 01:50:54.218]  Final segment.
[01:50:54.478 --> 01:50:57.359]  The full audience in 30 minutes in overdrive.
[01:50:57.519 --> 01:50:59.219]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:00.940]  Powerful information.
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:14.344]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:14.765 --> 01:51:21.527]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:51:21.887 --> 01:51:24.890]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought
[01:51:45.811 --> 01:51:49.472]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[01:51:49.492 --> 01:51:51.213]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[01:51:51.233 --> 01:51:52.874]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[01:51:52.894 --> 01:51:53.994]  Everyone needs something to
[01:52:23.439 --> 01:52:23.739]  I don't know.
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:53:03.308]  Right now the world is a scary place.
[01:53:03.548 --> 01:53:08.733]  It's only a matter of time until we are struck again, but this time with biological and chemical attacks.
[01:53:08.973 --> 01:53:13.377]  The thought is scary, but it's important to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[01:53:13.577 --> 01:53:16.260]  The First Line Defense Kit allows you to do just that.
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:26.228]  The first line of defense kit includes Nutri-Immune and Nutri-Defense, providing top biological host defenses against pathogen entry, and provides immune NK killer cell boosting.
[01:53:26.428 --> 01:53:34.935]  Also included, the Nano-Mask Nano-Particular Antiviral Masks with replacement filters, providing supreme viral protection from airborne pathogens.
[01:53:35.236 --> 01:53:36.857]  And, the first line of defense wipes,
[01:53:37.017 --> 01:53:37.517]  I think so.
[01:54:20.754 --> 01:54:22.315]  Alright, final segment for everybody.
[01:54:22.335 --> 01:54:27.537]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors and we'll wrap up the live show, but continue in Overdrive Live.
[01:54:27.557 --> 01:54:33.400]  We're going to play this little six-minute clip from one of his films where he's challenging the corrupt police to not be corrupted.
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:38.243]  And we'll talk more to Candy about some of the things she's witnessed and her whole view on this.
[01:54:38.263 --> 01:54:44.026]  I've got to have you guys back up for two, three hours in studio because with me adding all my stuff, it just runs over here.
[01:54:45.126 --> 01:54:53.457]  Before we go back to them, two of the sponsors that made today's show possible are Acola Blue and MySolar Backup.
[01:54:53.477 --> 01:54:55.200]  Let me tell you about MySolar Backup first.
[01:54:56.081 --> 01:54:58.204]  This is the best unit for the price.
[01:54:59.949 --> 01:55:08.652]  That we have found anywhere and it's from our great sponsor Solutions from Science that have a lot of products up on InfoWars.com that we link to.
[01:55:09.152 --> 01:55:16.694]  And this is a great emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:55:17.375 --> 01:55:20.696]  It's just a great little unit, the solar panel, the power system that stores it.
[01:55:21.016 --> 01:55:22.416]  You can run a lot of things on this.
[01:55:22.496 --> 01:55:24.337]  You can order multiple units if you want even more power.
[01:55:24.837 --> 01:55:27.258]  One word, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:55:27.338 --> 01:55:31.600]  MySolarBackup.com or give them a call to get a brochure or to order at 877-327-0365.
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:31.680]  877-327-0365.
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:32.320]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:32.640]  A great unit!
[01:55:41.503 --> 01:55:52.827]  And in closing, with our sponsors, is Ecolablue that we have right here in the office, back there in the break room, in the office, grabbing more than seven gallons a day out of the atmosphere.
[01:55:52.847 --> 01:55:53.888]  There's water in the atmosphere.
[01:55:53.908 --> 01:55:55.428]  You can't see it, except when it's clouds.
[01:55:55.948 --> 01:55:59.090]  And then it goes through five filters once it does that.
[01:55:59.150 --> 01:56:00.310]  So an amazing system.
[01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:01.511]  Ecolablue.com or 866-585-4044.
[01:56:01.531 --> 01:56:01.571]  866-585-4044.
[01:56:01.611 --> 01:56:02.391]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[01:56:10.794 --> 01:56:12.235]  It's an atmospheric water generator.
[01:56:12.575 --> 01:56:17.959]  You see Willie Nelson pitching his own similar system, but this is really a fantastic system.
[01:56:17.999 --> 01:56:22.482]  Again, at ColaBlue.com or Big Banners, up on Infowars.com.
[01:56:22.622 --> 01:56:25.164]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[01:56:25.604 --> 01:56:28.026]  And speaking of plugs, I want everybody to see these films.
[01:56:28.066 --> 01:56:40.374]  You know, I get so busy that I never get to ordering new products, getting them in the shopping cart at Infowars.com with all the other books and films that I've written or films I've made or other books and films we carry, like Kevin Booth's American Drug War that I consulted on.
[01:56:41.975 --> 01:56:43.475]  These videos, I've seen one of them.
[01:56:44.296 --> 01:56:45.837]  Everybody needs to get these.
[01:56:45.877 --> 01:56:53.780]  We're going to be carrying these the next few weeks at Infowars.com, but I want you to go to the website NeverGetBusted.com and get them today.
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:54.961]  Get both volumes.
[01:56:54.981 --> 01:56:56.822]  He gets death threats over these.
[01:56:57.202 --> 01:57:00.184]  This is key information that everybody needs to have.
[01:57:00.204 --> 01:57:02.706]  So again, we'll put it up on screen for the viewers as well.
[01:57:02.786 --> 01:57:05.308]  NeverGetBusted.com.
[01:57:05.548 --> 01:57:08.530]  And we'll play a clip from one of the films coming up in overdrive.
[01:57:08.850 --> 01:57:12.453]  In closing, for the full radio audience that's out there in two minutes, other comments.
[01:57:14.966 --> 01:57:16.046]  Other points you'd like to make?
[01:57:16.166 --> 01:57:35.534]  I'd like to make the point that in this second video there's an entire chapter dedicated to Fleur and secretly one of the narcotics officers connected to the narcotics officers that we just busted in Odessa, he sold that footage to me out of his evidence room for a thousand dollars.
[01:57:35.634 --> 01:57:39.556]  I just released that information on the internet the day before yesterday.
[01:57:40.336 --> 01:57:49.101]  In the first film, Traffic Stops 1, the same narcotics officer filmed his dog false alerting and sold that to me for $1,000.
[01:57:50.522 --> 01:57:55.425]  He's the same officer, Richard Dixon, that you see in the newspaper articles
[01:57:55.965 --> 01:57:59.748]  That claim Barry Cooper made those films for money only.
[01:58:00.268 --> 01:58:08.014]  The whole time he was spending the $2,300 that I paid him for footage for these very films.
[01:58:08.114 --> 01:58:13.438]  I want to talk more when we go into overdrive about how he didn't know he was selling this to you or he didn't know that you were setting him up.
[01:58:13.759 --> 01:58:17.462]  When we come back and a lot more for the AM and FM audience.
[01:58:17.562 --> 01:58:20.244]  We'll be back tomorrow 11 to 3 Central Standard Time.
[01:58:20.264 --> 01:58:21.885]  Very thankful for all of you out there.
[01:58:21.905 --> 01:58:24.207]  Be sure to support those local affiliates and their local sponsors.
[01:58:24.867 --> 01:58:26.529]  For everybody else, you'll want to go one place.
[01:58:27.029 --> 01:58:31.834]  My website to listen to the free audio streams or watch us at PrisonPlanet.tv if you're a member.
[01:58:32.495 --> 01:58:40.883]  Rebroadcast doesn't start now because we will continue to be live after this quick 70-second break right here on the GCN Radio Network and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:42.925 --> 01:58:44.807]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.638 --> 01:58:58.033]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:58.413 --> 01:59:00.077]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:59:22.858 --> 01:59:24.319]  Gentlemen, we just cut our feed.
[01:59:24.719 --> 01:59:27.280]  We just cut our feed connection with the GCN Network.
[01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:29.760]  We're only live now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:30.061 --> 01:59:31.221]  I want to flesh this out more.
[01:59:31.261 --> 01:59:32.562]  Now there won't be breaks for the next 30 minutes.
[01:59:32.582 --> 01:59:33.542]  We'll have plenty of time to talk.
[01:59:33.562 --> 01:59:38.544]  For the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and folks listening on the streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:59:38.744 --> 01:59:40.124]  Don't forget the free podcast, folks.

[01:59:43.746 --> 01:59:44.246]  We hope you will.
[01:59:45.146 --> 01:59:58.038]  Let's continue specifically with this latest thing you've been talking about in relation to how are you getting him to sell you videos, I guess this is before you exposed it, and then later he's claiming that it was just done for money.
[01:59:58.772 --> 01:59:59.232]  No, no, no.
[01:59:59.692 --> 02:00:01.373]  I might not have explained it well enough.
[02:00:01.813 --> 02:00:10.457]  Before Copbusters was ever invented and we were just doing never get busted films, I needed FLIR footage and I needed footage of a dog false alerting.
[02:00:11.038 --> 02:00:15.520]  So I called one of my ex-partners from the Permian Basin Drug Task Force.
[02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:20.162]  He's a Yoakum County's DA's narcotics investigator now.
[02:00:20.982 --> 02:00:25.984]  And I asked him if he had any of that for my films and he sold me that footage.
[02:00:26.664 --> 02:00:28.984]  I've kept it a secret this entire time.
[02:00:29.885 --> 02:00:37.687]  Now fast forward to four weeks ago when we set this dummy grow room and put Christmas trees under it instead of marijuana plants.
[02:00:38.327 --> 02:00:39.288]  We're good to go.
[02:00:53.038 --> 02:01:03.604]  Because on the search warrant affidavit, the only reasons they had listed for raid the cop buster's home, of course they didn't know it was a cop buster's home, was an anonymous letter and they made two drive-bys on the house.
[02:01:03.944 --> 02:01:06.846]  Well, that's not enough probable cause for a judge to sign the warrant.
[02:01:07.206 --> 02:01:08.587]  So he got busted as well.
[02:01:08.987 --> 02:01:11.769]  So I keep telling them, look, they're using these illegal FLIR cameras.
[02:01:11.789 --> 02:01:12.569]  They didn't believe it.
[02:01:12.889 --> 02:01:17.392]  So I said in three days I'll announce the proof, which was Monday.
[02:01:17.412 --> 02:01:22.635]  I announced the proof and I explained that I know they have a FLIR camera.
[02:01:23.075 --> 02:01:27.618]  Because one of your officers sold me the footage for my anti-drug war film.
[02:01:29.779 --> 02:01:35.583]  So they drove by our house and flirted illegally and didn't put that in the warrant.
[02:01:36.043 --> 02:01:38.585]  The judge signed the warrant and they kicked our door in.
[02:01:38.605 --> 02:01:43.748]  And we had hidden cameras in there that said you're part of a reality show called Copbusters.
[02:01:44.509 --> 02:01:46.490]  And all of us are unarmed.
[02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:48.612]  There's nothing illegal taking place.
[02:01:49.372 --> 02:01:53.273]  We'll be approaching within 10 minutes, all wearing red t-shirts.
[02:01:53.293 --> 02:01:54.493]  So you had a recording going?
[02:01:54.633 --> 02:01:55.653]  Oh yeah, hitting the cameras.
[02:01:55.913 --> 02:01:57.054]  We played that video earlier.
[02:01:57.074 --> 02:01:58.174]  They were just totally freaked out.
[02:01:58.254 --> 02:02:00.995]  In fact, there's a video on YouTube of the entire raid.
[02:02:01.035 --> 02:02:06.016]  It's four minutes, and you can see the cops walking around the room trying to figure out what's going on.
[02:02:06.036 --> 02:02:07.296]  Tell you what, what's the name of that YouTube?
[02:02:07.316 --> 02:02:08.356]  We'll pull that up and play it to you later.
[02:02:08.376 --> 02:02:10.157]  Oh, just go to copbusters.com.
[02:02:10.517 --> 02:02:11.717]  Go to the second page.
[02:02:11.757 --> 02:02:12.677]  There it is right there.
[02:02:12.977 --> 02:02:13.597]  The second one.
[02:02:13.957 --> 02:02:14.337]  Second one.
[02:02:14.357 --> 02:02:14.838]  We'll play that later.
[02:02:14.858 --> 02:02:15.478]  No, no, the third one.
[02:02:15.718 --> 02:02:16.278]  Third one, down here.
[02:02:16.778 --> 02:02:40.191]  Yeah, that's the entire raid and we proved their willingness to lie on an affidavit and we proved their willingness to do an illegal raid to expose these guys are crooked and we drew the bridge look this is the same group of guys that just planted the drugs on Yolanda and put her in prison for for eight years.
[02:02:40.691 --> 02:02:46.074]  So that was the big payoff of this thing was to bring national attention to the Yolanda Madden case.
[02:02:47.202 --> 02:02:52.488]  By the way, in 60 days we're going to sting another cop, so be ready for that.
[02:02:52.628 --> 02:02:53.709]  We're not going to stop.
[02:02:54.430 --> 02:03:02.379]  In fact, we could sting him today, but as well as you know, Alex, you know these things take time and timings.
[02:03:03.402 --> 02:03:05.583]  Important so we're going to wait a little bit and get him.
[02:03:05.783 --> 02:03:07.064]  Oh a lot of work goes into this.
[02:03:07.204 --> 02:03:10.886]  I mean I want to go into courage and talk a little bit to Candy about this.
[02:03:11.366 --> 02:03:20.050]  I mean men are designed, so are women, to be able to go out and confront bullies and just kind of shut off the fear and ignore it because you know it's for the greater good.
[02:03:21.410 --> 02:03:26.413]  But for a woman, and again women have great courage, but just still myself
[02:03:27.193 --> 02:03:27.974]  Being death-threatened.
[02:03:28.194 --> 02:03:37.520]  Myself going and covering Bilderberg, an elite meeting, and people calling up and having fake women, you know, call up and say, I got them pregnant, or calling up and threatening our family and our children.
[02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:39.481]  My wife's a special person.
[02:03:39.521 --> 02:03:40.141]  She deals with it.
[02:03:40.181 --> 02:03:41.582]  She just says, I know we're fighting this evil.
[02:03:41.923 --> 02:03:43.524]  You know, she just laughs at them when they call.
[02:03:44.985 --> 02:03:52.334]  But they're always trying new tricks, or they'll call up and say there's some woman and say, Alex gave me a disease, or you know, just all sorts of nasty dirty tricks.
[02:03:52.554 --> 02:03:54.156]  So I've lived some of what you've lived.
[02:03:55.297 --> 02:04:03.327]  More from both of you about the types of threats you get, any type of reprisals, and how you so cheerfully have this courage and go through this candy.
[02:04:04.332 --> 02:04:07.915]  Well, courage is contagious and Barry started the courage.
[02:04:08.035 --> 02:04:11.477]  So it's it's I don't know.
[02:04:11.557 --> 02:04:12.838]  It doesn't bother me.
[02:04:12.878 --> 02:04:13.979]  We're doing the right thing.
[02:04:13.999 --> 02:04:20.043]  I know we're doing the right thing and freedom, you know, it's that's a big deal and there's 1.5 million
[02:04:21.864 --> 02:04:22.545]  We have four kids.
[02:04:40.768 --> 02:04:41.749]  I'm just fighting for them.
[02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:49.735]  Candy, we work with the same energy that it was one of our kids sitting in prison.
[02:04:49.755 --> 02:04:50.375]  Exactly.
[02:04:50.395 --> 02:04:54.819]  Because we're not really free if one of our kids... That's the total spirit of liberty.
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:05:01.264]  When somebody does something to somebody else, I feel as if it's happening to me when I see those dead children in Gaza.
[02:05:01.764 --> 02:05:04.447]  That's exactly right, and that's what's happened in America.
[02:05:04.467 --> 02:05:05.288]  My father and grandfather
[02:05:20.879 --> 02:05:21.299]  We're good to go.
[02:05:45.456 --> 02:05:45.976]  And courage.
[02:05:46.416 --> 02:05:47.996]  Those are our weapons of warfare.
[02:05:48.036 --> 02:05:48.837]  We don't have guns.
[02:05:48.877 --> 02:05:49.937]  We can't shoot the police.
[02:05:50.277 --> 02:05:51.397]  We can't put them in jail.
[02:05:51.417 --> 02:05:52.597]  They have jails and guns.
[02:05:53.197 --> 02:05:54.077]  Well, there's another weapon.
[02:05:54.117 --> 02:05:54.958]  We have lawsuits.
[02:05:55.018 --> 02:05:56.198]  Get out and sue the police.
[02:05:56.618 --> 02:05:57.298]  Jam the courts.
[02:05:57.338 --> 02:05:57.878]  It only costs $350.
[02:05:57.918 --> 02:06:00.939]  There's YouTube clips of me explaining this.
[02:06:01.339 --> 02:06:01.759]  Costs $350.
[02:06:02.899 --> 02:06:05.619]  Walk down the federal courthouse and get a pro se packet.
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:07.800]  Takes an hour to fill it out and voila!
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:09.320]  The cops are sued in federal court.
[02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:10.260]  Candy and I have done it.
[02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:12.421]  We sued a judge in a police department.
[02:06:12.701 --> 02:06:13.041]  Cost us $350.
[02:06:14.721 --> 02:06:15.141]  It's wonderful.
[02:06:15.221 --> 02:06:17.222]  And even if they beat the ref, they don't beat the ride.
[02:06:17.262 --> 02:06:17.722]  That's right.
[02:06:17.742 --> 02:06:20.923]  Listen, the Attorney General has to spend money getting them expunged.
[02:06:21.003 --> 02:06:22.143]  And list everybody.
[02:06:22.203 --> 02:06:23.064]  List the judges.
[02:06:23.144 --> 02:06:24.744]  List everybody on the lawsuit.
[02:06:25.344 --> 02:06:29.346]  And, you know, they'll get the judge recused from the lawsuit because they have immunity.
[02:06:29.726 --> 02:06:36.288]  But what it does do for you is it puts you in a position that judge can never sit in judgment against you again because you sued them.
[02:06:36.308 --> 02:06:36.408]  Sure.
[02:06:36.428 --> 02:06:38.028]  So they have to get an outside visiting judge.
[02:06:38.288 --> 02:06:39.449]  There's strategy involved.
[02:06:40.129 --> 02:06:41.470]  It messes their whole system up.
[02:06:41.490 --> 02:06:42.011]  We like that.
[02:06:42.351 --> 02:06:47.196]  Or sometimes they don't recuse themselves and get more in trouble for violating the rules.
[02:06:48.217 --> 02:06:53.081]  You know, instead of myself just throwing out questions, other points, other important things you want to relay to people out there?
[02:06:55.524 --> 02:06:57.726]  Just have courage.
[02:06:58.346 --> 02:06:59.307]  Just have courage.
[02:06:59.367 --> 02:06:59.928]  Stand up.
[02:07:01.192 --> 02:07:01.452]  You know.
[02:07:02.093 --> 02:07:02.593]  Keep fighting?
[02:07:02.613 --> 02:07:03.354]  Yeah, keep fighting.
[02:07:03.554 --> 02:07:04.695]  Don't give up.
[02:07:04.735 --> 02:07:05.576]  Don't be afraid.
[02:07:05.616 --> 02:07:06.316]  Don't be scared.
[02:07:06.357 --> 02:07:07.878]  Just, you know, we'll help.
[02:07:08.518 --> 02:07:11.281]  Go on and do the cop busters.
[02:07:12.102 --> 02:07:13.303]  Report a cop, you know.
[02:07:13.643 --> 02:07:14.684]  Start suing cops.
[02:07:14.724 --> 02:07:15.344]  Do what you can.
[02:07:15.364 --> 02:07:17.887]  I'll tell you, I get afraid when I'm not fighting.
[02:07:18.007 --> 02:07:19.488]  I get upset when I'm not doing something.
[02:07:19.508 --> 02:07:23.692]  That's what I'm... But when you're standing up, there's... I don't have any fear.
[02:07:24.592 --> 02:07:25.393]  Is that what you're experiencing?
[02:07:25.413 --> 02:07:25.553]  Yes.
[02:07:25.893 --> 02:07:27.253]  Yeah, we're not afraid.
[02:07:27.434 --> 02:07:27.634]  No.
[02:07:27.754 --> 02:07:28.154]  We're not.
[02:07:28.214 --> 02:07:28.514]  Not at all.
[02:07:28.594 --> 02:07:30.835]  And that's the neat thing about courage.
[02:07:31.616 --> 02:07:34.597]  Courage will take the fear away if you start exercising it.
[02:07:34.657 --> 02:07:35.878]  It's like a muscle.
[02:07:35.918 --> 02:07:46.723]  Now, I'm not recommending for everybody to come out of the closet today and say, I smoke pot because you might lose your job, you might go to jail, but there are all kinds of cool ways you can help stand up and fight this war.
[02:07:46.743 --> 02:07:48.724]  I didn't have the courage I have now.
[02:07:48.744 --> 02:07:51.825]  I mean, it took a while from being with him especially.
[02:07:51.945 --> 02:07:52.906]  It took a while for me to
[02:07:53.526 --> 02:07:54.887]  Well, it's the arrogance.
[02:08:08.817 --> 02:08:15.880]  You know, police officers against prohibition and growing these judges and some high-powered, high-level coming out and agreeing, more and more people standing up.
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:28.365]  I don't want to just indict all the police carte blanche, but when it is a corrupt, sickening system across the board, and they're so arrogant about it, and the one town I grew up in, they were dealing drugs and threatening teenagers to shut up.
[02:08:29.345 --> 02:08:33.470]  I mean, this is a great evil that's grown, and now it's being federalized with Homeland Security.
[02:08:33.831 --> 02:08:44.623]  Now, I mean, we have to say no now, because anytime you let national security run everything, anytime the people aren't involved, anytime you just say, oh, do whatever you want, you're going to get a tyranny.
[02:08:44.864 --> 02:08:47.266]  Well, you know, America, it is okay to talk
[02:08:49.608 --> 02:08:53.710]  Now, most of them are good.
[02:08:53.770 --> 02:08:55.491]  It's only a few that make them all look bad.
[02:08:55.511 --> 02:08:56.331]  That's not true.
[02:08:56.451 --> 02:08:57.111]  It's the system.
[02:08:57.191 --> 02:08:58.112]  It is the system.
[02:08:58.172 --> 02:09:00.533]  For one, they're dealing with a corrupt handbook.
[02:09:00.593 --> 02:09:02.774]  The penal code itself is corrupt.
[02:09:03.114 --> 02:09:15.140]  So if you have men that rally around a corrupt book, even though they might not plant drugs and they might not break policies, they are breaking constitutional law.
[02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:22.405]  and they are the enemy and they are corrupt because they picked up a book that they go by that's anti-american.
[02:09:46.661 --> 02:09:53.447]  It's certainly a process of corruption and as you mentioned earlier it's an us-against-them attitude.
[02:09:53.827 --> 02:10:02.275]  They're supposed to be a citizen's police force yet they show up to the scenes looking who they can arrest or shoot.
[02:10:02.755 --> 02:10:04.477]  There needs to be an entire paradigm shift.
[02:10:04.497 --> 02:10:05.517]  So it's predatory?
[02:10:05.537 --> 02:10:10.800]  Yeah, they need to show up to the scene wondering in their own minds, who can I help?
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:12.080]  Who can I protect?
[02:10:12.161 --> 02:10:12.581]  Justice!
[02:10:12.601 --> 02:10:13.601]  Who can I assist?
[02:10:13.621 --> 02:10:14.642]  Well, I mean, take firefighters.
[02:10:14.682 --> 02:10:19.184]  The firefighters on the DART platform, when the unarmed guy, they slam him down, shoot him in the back.
[02:10:20.184 --> 02:10:21.284]  They confiscate the videos.
[02:10:21.505 --> 02:10:31.748]  Before it's known that people shot videos that they didn't see out of another train, that it was stopped, they said, oh, the videos malfunctioned, that were in the DART platform, and there were no other videos.
[02:10:31.808 --> 02:10:35.969]  Well, they had grabbed and taken two cell phones from people that did videotape it, but they didn't get all the cameras.
[02:10:36.429 --> 02:10:46.653]  So again, there's that total culture of we're all enemies, they're militarized, and they're all just freaking out when there's no enemy, and then they kill this guy, and then they go and try to cover it up.
[02:10:46.753 --> 02:10:49.074]  Just look at how they dress and how they look.
[02:10:49.114 --> 02:10:53.115]  They've kind of got that skinhead type look.
[02:10:53.135 --> 02:10:54.116]  They all look the same.
[02:10:54.456 --> 02:11:03.639]  And that's because it's only that genre or group of people that are willing to do what cops have to do now.
[02:11:03.859 --> 02:11:05.400]  But what happened to good cops that you saw?
[02:11:05.741 --> 02:11:08.279]  I mean, when people start saying no, what happens?
[02:11:10.666 --> 02:11:17.587]  Well, like what happened to me when I was doing my job and I arrested the mayor's son and I arrested the city councilman for marijuana.
[02:11:17.607 --> 02:11:20.228]  They start pushing you out when you get too close.
[02:11:23.668 --> 02:11:36.411]  It's hard for me to say there are good cops because if the citizens know about all the corruption, we know for sure the good cops, quote unquote good cops in the department, know about the corruption and they're turning a blind eye to it.
[02:11:37.051 --> 02:11:44.078]  When they're sworn to uphold the Constitution and protect the American people, those good cops should be turning on all the bad cops.
[02:11:44.118 --> 02:11:44.999]  Where are the good cops?
[02:11:45.279 --> 02:11:50.143]  How come they're not emailing me saying, Barry, I'm glad you caught cops in an illegal raid.
[02:11:50.484 --> 02:11:51.685]  We need to do more of this.
[02:11:52.025 --> 02:11:56.389]  In fact, I've got a cop in my unit that does the same thing and I'll help you bust him.
[02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:59.833]  So see, it's hard for me to say there are good cops.
[02:12:00.453 --> 02:12:05.096]  If there are good cops, how come they're not taking a stance and helping us?
[02:12:05.656 --> 02:12:06.317]  Helping you?
[02:12:06.797 --> 02:12:09.259]  Helping the Americans get their freedoms back?
[02:12:09.659 --> 02:12:11.840]  They're not doing it because there are no good cops.
[02:12:12.101 --> 02:12:15.243]  They can say I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, but talk is cheap.
[02:12:15.903 --> 02:12:16.964]  Let's see it.
[02:12:17.184 --> 02:12:17.604]  I agree with you.
[02:12:17.944 --> 02:12:20.086]  When the system's corrupt and officers that don't
[02:12:21.869 --> 02:12:23.670]  Officially get involved in the corruption.
[02:12:23.710 --> 02:12:27.013]  They don't have their hands in it, but they stand by and turn a blind eye.
[02:12:27.333 --> 02:12:28.454]  They are now accessories.
[02:12:28.514 --> 02:12:29.255]  They're part of it.
[02:12:29.315 --> 02:12:34.819]  Just like if I see somebody being murdered and I turn a blind eye and I don't help, I'm in trouble.
[02:12:35.159 --> 02:12:37.601]  It's the same with the police officers in this land.
[02:12:37.941 --> 02:12:40.463]  I have zero respect for law enforcement.
[02:12:40.603 --> 02:12:43.105]  I want to have respect for law enforcement.
[02:12:43.145 --> 02:12:44.206]  We need law enforcement.
[02:12:44.666 --> 02:12:49.530]  There are crazy people, there are animals in this land that want to hurt me and Candy and our children.
[02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:52.911]  So I have a lot of respect for cages to lock those kind of people up.
[02:12:54.032 --> 02:12:55.112]  A lot of those are the cops.
[02:12:55.172 --> 02:12:56.353]  Yeah, a lot of those are the cops.
[02:12:56.373 --> 02:12:57.313]  They don't want to hurt me.
[02:12:57.373 --> 02:13:10.939]  I don't have any respect for our criminal justice system in America, and we're going to continue dismantling it, doing whatever we can until the next tears that come to my eyes are going to be the tears of joys watching those prison doors shake open.
[02:13:11.079 --> 02:13:11.899]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[02:13:11.919 --> 02:13:17.561]  Because they have to have a phony pretext to put people in prison for substances when it really is an illness.
[02:13:17.941 --> 02:13:19.162]  I mean, here I am drinking coffee.
[02:13:19.722 --> 02:13:21.404]  I quit smoking for a month, start back in.
[02:13:21.444 --> 02:13:23.085]  I'm out there smoking cigarettes during the breaks.
[02:13:24.306 --> 02:13:30.832]  The neuron receptors that coffee and cigarettes hit are the same ones that narcotics hit.
[02:13:31.333 --> 02:13:34.175]  So I'm literally using something that hits narcotic receptors.
[02:13:34.235 --> 02:13:35.977]  This is a narcotic amphetamine.
[02:13:36.437 --> 02:13:37.518]  I am drinking it right now.
[02:13:37.538 --> 02:13:43.764]  I can do two cups of coffee and it speeds me up more than one line of cocaine.
[02:13:45.181 --> 02:13:59.240]  And that's my point is that it needs to be smoking isn't good, cocaine isn't good, cigarettes aren't good, and out of all these drugs that we know are bad, we know that it is marijuana that actually has all these health effects.
[02:13:59.841 --> 02:14:05.963]  You can get rid of 90% of the pills in your life and in America's life with that pot.
[02:14:06.043 --> 02:14:11.866]  You can stop the alcoholism, the people that are on the Prozac, the uptake inhibitors like you were talking about.
[02:14:11.906 --> 02:14:13.666]  They need a tripod!
[02:14:13.766 --> 02:14:21.569]  That's why Big Pharma has thousands of prescriptions now with THC, but they've noticed it isn't as good because it's not mixed with all the other little cofactors that are in there.
[02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:25.271]  I mean, marijuana really is a magic plant.
[02:14:26.218 --> 02:14:27.318]  It's a medicine.
[02:14:27.358 --> 02:14:31.200]  People all the time talk about it helps patients with glaucoma and cancer.
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:40.743]  My stomach was so bad I thought I was going to die because I had pancreatitis and Crohn's and if I hadn't had the pot, I don't...
[02:14:41.603 --> 02:14:43.884]  I don't think I would have made it, because I was down to 90 pounds.
[02:14:43.904 --> 02:14:46.445]  Well, you know Crohn's is caused mainly by the vaccines.
[02:14:46.485 --> 02:14:50.266]  It didn't exist until the vaccines, and almost everybody, they've tested their intestines.
[02:14:51.066 --> 02:14:57.208]  It is a virus that was in a particular vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella that did that.
[02:14:57.468 --> 02:14:58.369]  I don't have it now.
[02:14:58.429 --> 02:15:00.789]  We have one of the autistic kids from that, too.
[02:15:00.909 --> 02:15:01.990]  Our five, six-year-olds.
[02:15:02.130 --> 02:15:02.810]  Oh my God.
[02:15:03.090 --> 02:15:04.851]  But people talk about like it helped her humming.
[02:15:04.871 --> 02:15:06.131]  See, you've been abused by it right there.
[02:15:06.191 --> 02:15:06.751]  It's everywhere.
[02:15:06.811 --> 02:15:07.051]  Right.
[02:15:07.111 --> 02:15:08.332]  She's been hit by the vaccines.
[02:15:09.372 --> 02:15:09.632]  Right.
[02:15:10.893 --> 02:15:18.557]  And what everybody's talking about how marijuana is such a good medicine for cancer patients and glaucoma.
[02:15:18.577 --> 02:15:22.240]  What about people like me that really works on themselves?
[02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:27.383]  I have all my life to be a better person and I can't calm myself down sometimes.
[02:15:28.303 --> 02:15:28.964]  And I smoke.
[02:15:29.184 --> 02:15:29.904]  It's great for ADD.
[02:15:29.944 --> 02:15:34.347]  Yeah, if I took Xanax and stuff like that, it has a bad side effect and I couldn't do that.
[02:15:34.828 --> 02:15:38.270]  But I smoke a little pot and it calms me down and I'm a nicer person.
[02:15:39.251 --> 02:15:45.656]  It should be prescribed to our criminals, the true criminals, that burglarize and rape and murder and harm.
[02:15:45.816 --> 02:15:48.358]  They're putting them in jail for peeing dirty for pot.
[02:15:48.378 --> 02:15:50.639]  They should prescribe it to them and give it to them in jail.
[02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:52.281]  I had cars stolen twice.
[02:15:53.388 --> 02:15:53.728]  Okay.
[02:15:54.749 --> 02:15:58.453]  Back in college, I had a girlfriend in Dallas, so I kept driving up there every weekend.
[02:15:59.174 --> 02:16:01.996]  Decent neighborhood, had the Mustang stolen twice.
[02:16:02.637 --> 02:16:07.381]  And I'd call the Dallas PD, and I'd say, okay, green Mustang stolen.
[02:16:07.421 --> 02:16:09.944]  And they'd say, oh, we don't even investigate car thefts anymore.
[02:16:10.988 --> 02:16:13.428]  And I said, okay, well you can't help me, and I hung up the phone.
[02:16:13.989 --> 02:16:25.431]  Bang, bang, bang, open the door, the cops bust in, guns drawn, but they weren't rude, but they violated my Fourth Amendment, came into her apartment, went through the whole place looking for something illegal, and then said, you're not supposed to hang up on 9-1-1.
[02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:27.691]  I said, well, okay, you can't help me, bang.
[02:16:29.771 --> 02:16:31.612]  So, well, they actually gave me a number.
[02:16:31.632 --> 02:16:36.733]  They said later it may show up at this tow shop if it's been, you know, left on the road somewhere, which it did a few days later.
[02:16:37.333 --> 02:16:38.593]  And I said, okay, thanks for the number, boom.
[02:16:39.775 --> 02:16:40.775]  The cops show up.
[02:16:41.255 --> 02:16:43.796]  My point is, is that there's real criminals everywhere.
[02:16:43.816 --> 02:16:44.876]  There's real crime going on.
[02:16:44.896 --> 02:16:45.836]  The economy going down.
[02:16:46.137 --> 02:16:48.137]  There's rapes and burglaries and home invasions.
[02:16:48.177 --> 02:16:48.997]  I mean, speak about it.
[02:16:49.017 --> 02:16:49.657]  Child molesters.
[02:16:50.178 --> 02:16:50.698]  Absolutely.
[02:16:51.378 --> 02:16:53.918]  Well, it's exactly like you said.
[02:16:53.938 --> 02:17:08.302]  They're concentrating in arresting people that are non-violent and overlooking the violent offenders to the tune of, you know, people that molest children are being released out of prison to make room
[02:17:08.942 --> 02:17:09.122]  Yeah.
[02:17:24.435 --> 02:17:25.917]  Never answer the door for the cops.
[02:17:26.117 --> 02:17:28.539]  Ever, ever, ever, ever don't answer the door.
[02:17:28.899 --> 02:17:32.522]  You go next to a window, open the curtain and say, I don't open the door for cops.
[02:17:32.922 --> 02:17:34.624]  If you have a search warrant, kick the door.
[02:17:35.044 --> 02:17:40.409]  Because if they're knocking on your door, that's telling you they don't have the probable cause to kick the door.
[02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:42.451]  And they want to talk to you to claim they smelled marijuana.
[02:17:42.471 --> 02:17:47.075]  They want the door open so they can claim they smelled marijuana and search your house.
[02:17:47.115 --> 02:17:48.095]  Don't open the door.
[02:17:48.115 --> 02:17:50.017]  Or claim that they believe that there may be a threat to them.
[02:17:50.357 --> 02:17:50.838]  Exactly.
[02:17:51.647 --> 02:17:52.307]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:17:52.347 --> 02:17:53.408]  They use that all the time.
[02:17:53.448 --> 02:18:03.693]  You know, I felt officers say, listen, in the academy, when I graduated the police academy, after 10 weeks, only 10 weeks, I was 21 years old, I was afraid of civilians.
[02:18:04.354 --> 02:18:09.977]  They made me believe every traffic stop I was going to be involved with, I could die on that traffic stop.
[02:18:10.017 --> 02:18:14.199]  So I was the guy who walked up real careful and scared, ready to shoot citizens.
[02:18:14.599 --> 02:18:15.660]  Because that's how
[02:18:16.553 --> 02:18:17.053]  We were trained.
[02:18:17.073 --> 02:18:20.074]  Only 28 cops have died in drug related offenses in a 10 year period from
[02:18:39.041 --> 02:18:40.542]  96 to 2006.
[02:18:41.223 --> 02:18:44.125]  They make us believe cops are getting shot every day in this war on drugs.
[02:18:44.506 --> 02:18:53.234]  Only 2.8 cops per year are dying in this war on drugs, compared to the millions of Americans getting put in jail and getting shot.
[02:18:53.434 --> 02:18:57.938]  And whoever said the life of a cop was more valuable than the life of a citizen?
[02:18:58.018 --> 02:18:59.299]  It's supposed to be the other way around!
[02:18:59.439 --> 02:19:03.022]  And we now, well now they have huge official parades for a dead drug dog.
[02:19:03.783 --> 02:19:05.745]  And then it's like, remember down in Houston?
[02:19:05.765 --> 02:19:06.425]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:19:06.525 --> 02:19:06.886]  What about this?
[02:19:06.906 --> 02:19:09.128]  8,000 deaths on the contiguous 2,300 mile border with the United States and northern Mexico.
[02:19:09.148 --> 02:19:12.571]  8,000 deaths in 2008 and that was with a month running, so back in November.
[02:19:26.024 --> 02:19:27.146]  Who knows, it may be above 8,000.
[02:19:27.987 --> 02:19:33.555]  2,000 on the Texas-Mexico border alone, and then over 500 people killed just across the border with Texas.
[02:19:33.595 --> 02:19:36.939]  So we're talking, you know, just masses of dead people.
[02:19:37.831 --> 02:19:41.774]  Rocket attacks, car bombs, whole cities basically shut down on the Texas border.
[02:19:42.034 --> 02:19:43.054]  I've been down there, it's scary.
[02:19:44.115 --> 02:19:52.300]  And the drug gangs are completely taking over because they've made drugs illegal, it makes these huge profits in it, and so the criminals have a whole new theater to operate in.
[02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:56.423]  And let me tell you, the police are scared to death of those people, and they're just leaving all that alone down there.
[02:19:56.723 --> 02:19:57.864]  And they're keeping that quiet.
[02:19:58.924 --> 02:20:03.267]  They're even killing federal officers every few weeks and shooting at people, but that's all kept quiet.
[02:20:03.287 --> 02:20:05.888]  Then they hype up some cop getting shot in Chicago.
[02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:32.674]  Arizona after they got that like three big three-ton marijuana bust last couple weeks and he was involved in the investigation when he announced the large bust he also announced that he's for legalization of marijuana because those drug cartels you're talking about fund their operations 80% of it through marijuana sales.
[02:20:34.096 --> 02:20:36.818]  Again, alcoholism tripled during Prohibition.
[02:20:36.938 --> 02:20:40.061]  It energized the mob, which grew over a thousand percent.
[02:20:40.081 --> 02:20:41.021]  That's the Fed Zone numbers.
[02:20:41.522 --> 02:20:42.562]  It corrupted police.
[02:20:43.343 --> 02:20:44.404]  It destroyed our society.
[02:20:44.844 --> 02:20:49.348]  And when they lost that, they brought in drug prohibition to keep that scam and business going.
[02:20:49.828 --> 02:20:55.812]  You know, I want to continue here and come back with some final comments from both of you, but instead of playing the video,
[02:20:57.273 --> 02:21:03.498]  Let's go to the six minute clip that you were talking about where you're challenging police.
[02:21:03.538 --> 02:21:06.341]  Which clip is that so they know which one to play?
[02:21:06.901 --> 02:21:09.283]  Plea to the police on Never Get Raided.
[02:21:09.424 --> 02:21:14.208]  It's the volume two and you'll see in a minute I explain to the cops
[02:21:14.668 --> 02:21:17.809]  An alternative way of running a search warrant.
[02:21:17.869 --> 02:21:21.471]  Until we get the drug war repealed, I've got a foolproof plan in there.
[02:21:21.831 --> 02:21:25.113]  How to raid houses and never cause any harm.
[02:21:25.153 --> 02:21:32.416]  In fact, there was a sheriff in West Texas that when we went into his jurisdiction, that's how he insisted we raided the house.
[02:21:33.116 --> 02:21:34.176]  And it's in this clip.
[02:21:34.436 --> 02:21:37.438]  Cops do not have to throw flash grenades through windows.
[02:21:38.298 --> 02:21:44.060]  And surround the house with SWAT gear and terrorize families to search for the drug.
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:46.961]  Well now they're also converting the giant drug war apparatus.
[02:21:47.081 --> 02:21:48.801]  They're keeping its funding the same or increasing it.
[02:21:49.081 --> 02:21:52.962]  But they're now dual training for political prisoners against the American people.
[02:21:53.122 --> 02:21:53.762]  Anti-terror.
[02:21:54.003 --> 02:21:58.984]  They're using the whole informant system now in Homeland Security to spy on people for their political views.
[02:21:59.284 --> 02:22:01.305]  The state police all over the country have been caught.
[02:22:01.325 --> 02:22:02.365]  I'm sure you've seen it in the press.
[02:22:03.045 --> 02:22:05.006]  Spying on groups that are against toll roads.
[02:22:05.447 --> 02:22:07.548]  Spying on groups that are against the war.
[02:22:07.968 --> 02:22:10.290]  Spying on groups that lobby for bike lanes.
[02:22:10.690 --> 02:22:16.333]  I mean, and they're putting in the files that they are terrorists for those views and using anti-terror laws.
[02:22:16.593 --> 02:22:18.154]  So now they've created the Defaunty Drug War.
[02:22:18.415 --> 02:22:21.917]  They're now expanding it into the Terror War against the American people.
[02:22:21.957 --> 02:22:23.478]  And now they've announced 20,000 U.S.
[02:22:23.858 --> 02:22:27.760]  mainline army troops to be used at checkpoints for drunk drivers.
[02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:30.442]  And they've got Marines in California running checkpoints
[02:22:31.102 --> 02:22:31.642]  I don't know.
[02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:49.991]  And we can't get anything changed.
[02:22:50.031 --> 02:22:54.113]  We're going to continue our fight in America, but we're going to do it from some other country.
[02:22:54.954 --> 02:22:57.515]  It's not safe here in America.
[02:22:57.535 --> 02:22:59.956]  But the media, the mainstream media glosses it over.
[02:23:00.156 --> 02:23:03.578]  The mainstream media is the old AM channel, which is what I like.
[02:23:03.758 --> 02:23:08.080]  You know, Fox and CNN and newspapers.
[02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:10.081]  You know, newspapers are a thing of the past.
[02:23:11.142 --> 02:23:13.063]  If the internet is the new FM,
[02:23:13.986 --> 02:23:15.066]  I agree with him.
[02:23:15.086 --> 02:23:18.108]  My point is that they gloss it all over.
[02:23:18.148 --> 02:23:19.708]  They even gloss over them killing this guy.
[02:23:20.928 --> 02:23:22.389]  In California, they just gloss.
[02:23:22.489 --> 02:23:24.030]  They go, well, you can see he was scuffling.
[02:23:24.350 --> 02:23:24.910]  Slam him down.
[02:23:24.930 --> 02:23:25.550]  He's not moving.
[02:23:25.710 --> 02:23:27.591]  They kill him and the media goes, well, he was scuffling.
[02:23:28.288 --> 02:23:29.228]  I guess they needed to kill him.
[02:23:30.649 --> 02:23:35.790]  Again, the system does all this PR, selling us that it's okay, but they don't see the statistics.
[02:23:35.810 --> 02:23:40.391]  They grab over a million children with CPS a year in this country, and there's no due process.
[02:23:40.731 --> 02:23:55.516]  Briefly, before we go to this, when we come back from this clip, talk about what it was like when you would see the CPS coming and grabbing the children after you'd done a drug raid, and the horror in the children that you mentioned a little bit earlier, and then we'll probably end it with that and let you guys eat some of the pizza we just got out there.
[02:23:55.536 --> 02:23:56.436]  Let's go ahead and go to this
[02:23:57.858 --> 02:23:59.619]  When I was a police officer, SWAT teams were very rare.
[02:23:59.639 --> 02:24:01.821]  Now it seems every town has a little SWAT team.
[02:24:34.628 --> 02:24:47.052]  During the shooting of this film, we learned that three days ago in a small town in Ohio, a SWAT team raided a 25-year-old mother with six children.
[02:24:47.852 --> 02:24:53.854]  They used flash grenades and machine guns, shooting and killing the 25-year-old mother,
[02:24:55.871 --> 02:24:58.593]  Shooting the one-year-old baby in her arms.
[02:24:59.154 --> 02:25:05.299]  The one-year-old baby had to have a finger amputated and they're not sure what's going to happen to the arm.
[02:25:05.659 --> 02:25:16.188]  Does America need another drug case that bad that they have to shoot and kill a 25-year-old mother and a one-year-old baby?
[02:25:17.065 --> 02:25:22.973]  And what's even crazier is there is a non-violent way to conduct search warrants.
[02:25:23.433 --> 02:25:29.821]  Many cops have heard about the West Texas Sheriff that used to conduct raids in a non-violent manner.
[02:25:30.714 --> 02:25:39.198]  You remember how if he had a search warrant for a person's home, he simply did surveillance on the house until the residents drove away?
[02:25:39.738 --> 02:25:53.945]  And he pulled them over on a traffic stop, arrested them, got the keys to the house, interviewed the suspect, ultimately resulting in placing a key in a door and opening the house and calling the other people forward to arrest them?
[02:25:55.091 --> 02:25:57.212]  Without any shots being fired?
[02:25:57.472 --> 02:25:58.932]  Without any flash grenades?
[02:25:58.972 --> 02:26:00.193]  Without any of that stuff?
[02:26:00.533 --> 02:26:03.614]  Listen, I know what the police are doing.
[02:26:04.514 --> 02:26:13.337]  You're breaking into these homes in this manner, not because you have to, but because you have this huge adrenaline rush and you think it's cool.
[02:26:13.797 --> 02:26:17.338]  It's not cool terrorizing our American families.
[02:26:17.658 --> 02:26:20.559]  So please, until we get this drug war repealed,
[02:26:21.676 --> 02:26:32.769]  Change your way of breaking into our homes so we don't have to go to the funerals of 25-year-old mothers and we don't handicap a one-year-old baby the rest of his life.
[02:26:38.536 --> 02:26:40.819]  Barry and I have four wonderful kids.
[02:26:41.428 --> 02:26:44.249]  Who are straight-A students and popular wherever they go.
[02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:49.532]  The reason for this is because we teach our kids the truth about everything, including drugs.
[02:26:49.792 --> 02:26:51.413]  Candy's exactly right.
[02:26:52.194 --> 02:26:57.536]  Parents, stop trusting government programs such as D.A.R.E.
[02:26:58.017 --> 02:27:00.638]  to teach your kids the truth about drugs.
[02:27:01.198 --> 02:27:02.839]  They're not teaching the truth.
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:04.660]  They're teaching lies.
[02:27:05.641 --> 02:27:07.782]  Did you know in 5,000 years of recorded use,
[02:27:10.439 --> 02:27:13.840]  Not one person has ever overdosed on marijuana.
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:22.583]  You know it's sad our kids have to share books in our public school systems and struggle to get money to go to college.
[02:27:23.304 --> 02:27:30.146]  Yet we spend 17 million dollars a day housing our non-violent drug offenders.
[02:27:31.406 --> 02:27:39.089]  We built 21 prisons in the state of California last year and only one university.
[02:27:39.997 --> 02:27:42.178]  Parents, something is backwards.
[02:27:42.778 --> 02:27:44.159]  I want you to think about something.
[02:27:44.499 --> 02:27:50.181]  When was the last time you heard of a kid dying from an illegal drug in your neighborhood?
[02:27:51.242 --> 02:27:53.222]  It's very, very rare.
[02:27:54.243 --> 02:27:57.144]  It's not the drugs that are killing our kids.
[02:27:57.584 --> 02:27:59.065]  It's prohibition.
[02:27:59.605 --> 02:28:06.908]  Do you realize we have 1.5 million children without one or both parents
[02:28:07.566 --> 02:28:08.767]  Because of the drug war?
[02:28:09.188 --> 02:28:12.912]  That's right, their parents are setting out a non-violent drug crime.
[02:28:13.673 --> 02:28:15.175]  Now what causes more harm?
[02:28:15.235 --> 02:28:15.835]  The drug?
[02:28:16.476 --> 02:28:18.298]  Or the kids not being with their parents?
[02:28:18.638 --> 02:28:22.523]  And finally, we must be honest about our parenting skills.
[02:28:22.943 --> 02:28:24.445]  We've all made mistakes.
[02:28:25.086 --> 02:28:34.392]  There is absolutely no evidence that says when a kid uses drugs it causes them to go burglarize or commit another crime.
[02:28:34.813 --> 02:28:40.857]  The truth is selfishness and dishonor and disrespect are causing those things.
[02:28:41.537 --> 02:28:49.102]  It's easy for parents and teachers and doctors to blame our children's bad behavior on the drugs.
[02:28:49.462 --> 02:28:50.283]  The truth is
[02:28:51.192 --> 02:28:52.612]  It's bad parenting.
[02:28:52.992 --> 02:28:59.034]  We already have laws in place in this country to protect me and you and our kids.
[02:28:59.754 --> 02:29:04.895]  If a person commits a crime of violence, there's a law in place to put them in jail for that.
[02:29:05.815 --> 02:29:07.555]  We live in America, parents.
[02:29:08.496 --> 02:29:19.678]  And if people want to use drugs till their teeth fall out of their head, and develop this horrible quality of life because they wouldn't stop, they have the right to be miserable.
[02:29:20.453 --> 02:29:30.604]  Now, if they get up out of that drug-induced state and go and commit a crime, put them in jail for that crime, but not the drug.
[02:29:31.345 --> 02:29:32.286]  He's right, parents.
[02:29:33.047 --> 02:29:35.369]  Teach your kids the truth about drugs.
[02:29:36.451 --> 02:29:38.953]  Love, peace, and never get busted.
[02:29:48.035 --> 02:29:54.579]  There's a former cop put up a website that tells drug dealers and drug smugglers how to get away with their crimes, correct?
[02:29:55.460 --> 02:29:55.640]  Right.
[02:29:55.680 --> 02:29:58.822]  He's a former cop who is against the war on drugs, thinks it's a bad idea.
[02:29:58.902 --> 02:30:00.203]  But I mean, it's just vile.
[02:30:00.223 --> 02:30:02.545]  I mean, these people are just vile.
[02:30:02.605 --> 02:30:03.585]  It gets worse and worse.
[02:30:07.788 --> 02:30:11.451]  And sometimes body wires come in the form of a book.
[02:30:13.472 --> 02:30:14.352]  This one's 30% off, by the way.
[02:30:17.023 --> 02:30:17.783]  Alright, folks.
[02:30:18.584 --> 02:30:21.965]  This is our final segment in Overdrive with our guest.
[02:30:22.606 --> 02:30:23.606]  And, you know what?
[02:30:24.487 --> 02:30:32.371]  Barry, I've got to say, I've run into a lot of folks, I think you're one of the few people who I can actually get, since you live here in Austin now, to sit in on the show sometimes, guest host it when I'm out.
[02:30:32.971 --> 02:30:41.115]  And, you know, I haven't intended to do a TV network other than my own show that we're developing this for Dish Network and Cable in the next few months.
[02:30:42.515 --> 02:30:43.736]  This is kind of the prototype in here.
[02:30:45.757 --> 02:30:56.766]  I just right now want to extend the opportunity in the next few weeks to get you to come in once a week or something and do a two or three hour once a week show just so you learn the ropes because I want to get you involved with the team.
[02:30:56.946 --> 02:30:57.787]  Hey, I'd be honored.
[02:30:57.807 --> 02:30:59.068]  You're a fascinating man.
[02:30:59.088 --> 02:31:02.030]  You've got a crew that's magnificent here.
[02:31:02.050 --> 02:31:02.891]  Candy and I are impressed.
[02:31:02.911 --> 02:31:05.953]  We've been in a lot of studios and we'd love to be a part of it.
[02:31:05.974 --> 02:31:06.534]  It's great.
[02:31:06.794 --> 02:31:09.496]  Well, we're just getting started and so this is very exciting.
[02:31:09.516 --> 02:31:11.718]  We'll definitely get something done on this.
[02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:15.801]  There are so many things I haven't gone over.
[02:31:15.841 --> 02:31:17.202]  So many things I know that you haven't gone over.
[02:31:17.222 --> 02:31:18.323]  We've covered a lot.
[02:31:19.064 --> 02:31:21.425]  But in closing, any other points you want to make?
[02:31:21.465 --> 02:31:22.626]  Things you think are important?
[02:31:23.267 --> 02:31:25.028]  And then the CPS issue.
[02:31:26.029 --> 02:31:27.910]  The tearing up families in the drug war.
[02:31:28.851 --> 02:31:30.031]  I can talk about that.
[02:31:30.832 --> 02:31:32.333]  It still makes me teary-eyed.
[02:31:32.473 --> 02:31:33.334]  I'm okay.
[02:31:33.354 --> 02:31:36.256]  I understand post-traumatic stress syndrome somewhat.
[02:31:36.316 --> 02:31:38.458]  You know, it affects some people worse than others.
[02:31:39.352 --> 02:31:43.716]  I think I have a touch of that, because it's been 13, 14 years and I still have nightmares from it.
[02:31:43.756 --> 02:31:44.697]  I'm okay.
[02:31:44.717 --> 02:31:45.958]  It hasn't harmed me.
[02:31:45.998 --> 02:31:50.082]  Well, they call it post-traumatic, but it's doing things that are immoral that affect you.
[02:31:50.102 --> 02:31:53.084]  But now the cure is doing things that are moral.
[02:31:53.164 --> 02:31:56.007]  It's the eyes of those kids looking at me.
[02:31:57.348 --> 02:31:58.229]  What's going on?
[02:31:58.349 --> 02:31:59.210]  Scared to death.
[02:31:59.410 --> 02:32:04.375]  They've been trained cops are good, yet they see me taking the parents away.
[02:32:05.533 --> 02:32:08.435]  And we always had a lady there, you know, to deal with the kids.
[02:32:08.455 --> 02:32:09.916]  Would you plant drugs in those cages?
[02:32:10.296 --> 02:32:10.516]  Yes.
[02:32:10.816 --> 02:32:11.397]  Good God.
[02:32:12.037 --> 02:32:13.278]  How do they morally do that?
[02:32:13.298 --> 02:32:15.279]  I don't know.
[02:32:15.759 --> 02:32:19.242]  So these CPS workers would then take the children, and a lot of times they never went back to their parents.
[02:32:19.962 --> 02:32:20.222]  Right.
[02:32:20.382 --> 02:32:23.624]  To the tune of, now Candy was, you know, got the new statistic.
[02:32:23.644 --> 02:32:30.809]  There's two million kids now without one or both parents because they're sitting out a drug crime in a cage.
[02:32:31.457 --> 02:32:33.459]  But he really thought he was doing the right thing.
[02:32:33.499 --> 02:32:34.379]  No, no, I understand.
[02:32:34.900 --> 02:32:38.922]  Listen, I don't ever judge people for bad things they've done.
[02:32:39.323 --> 02:32:44.226]  If they wake up to it and then not just say, I was wrong, but then go and fight against it.
[02:32:44.266 --> 02:32:44.766]  That's right.
[02:32:45.067 --> 02:32:49.890]  I mean, Saul of Tarsus went and hunted down Christians and killed them and tortured them and crucified them.
[02:32:50.290 --> 02:32:55.394]  And then he had this epiphany on the road to Damascus and became, you know, just an amazing person against evil.
[02:32:55.754 --> 02:32:57.235]  So, a lot of times,
[02:32:57.635 --> 02:33:01.576]  A lot of times the greatest soldiers against tyranny are those that have been in the belly of the beast.
[02:33:01.637 --> 02:33:02.757]  That's actually who we need.
[02:33:03.237 --> 02:33:09.439]  In fact, I want to put the call out to others out there watching who've been serving evil, who've been in denial, but have this horrible feeling in their heart and soul.
[02:33:09.739 --> 02:33:10.720]  You can get rid of that.
[02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:13.921]  It can stop when you stop the denial and really become a good person.
[02:33:15.009 --> 02:33:15.569]  Absolutely.
[02:33:15.849 --> 02:33:17.510]  It's never too late to change.
[02:33:17.570 --> 02:33:19.951]  They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks.
[02:33:19.971 --> 02:33:20.731]  That's a lie.
[02:33:21.051 --> 02:33:25.773]  You have a will and you can switch your mind and switch your actions overnight.
[02:33:26.233 --> 02:33:26.674]  I did.
[02:33:27.054 --> 02:33:34.877]  Once I realized and Candy started pointing these things out to me, you know, I switched and then I was lucky enough to have this opportunity to
[02:33:35.785 --> 02:33:38.948]  To be able to produce these films and then now do copbusters.
[02:33:38.988 --> 02:33:43.151]  Not everybody has that opportunity, but everybody can change.
[02:33:43.832 --> 02:33:46.434]  Everybody can do a YouTube channel.
[02:33:46.634 --> 02:33:48.075]  Good people have to become vocal.
[02:33:48.456 --> 02:33:52.219]  We have great tools, as you said, the internet and other things to do that, or starting a local radio show.
[02:33:52.259 --> 02:33:57.303]  I tell folks, if you have to go buy time, you know, 60, 70, 100 bucks an hour on some local station on the weekend,
[02:33:57.663 --> 02:33:59.604]  After a few months you'll have an audience that tunes in.
[02:33:59.624 --> 02:34:00.745]  You can get a few sponsors.
[02:34:01.085 --> 02:34:02.005]  Fund yourself that way.
[02:34:02.145 --> 02:34:04.006]  AXS TV was born here in Austin.
[02:34:04.026 --> 02:34:05.467]  That's how I started 13 years ago.
[02:34:06.207 --> 02:34:09.489]  But flesh that out just for a few more minutes and then we're going to plug the film and end this.
[02:34:10.609 --> 02:34:11.750]  Again, about the CPS.
[02:34:13.091 --> 02:34:14.091]  What was it like seeing this?
[02:34:14.451 --> 02:34:18.853]  Well, I know what it's like for my kids to be separated from me through a divorce.
[02:34:19.073 --> 02:34:20.894]  Now we eventually won all of our kids.
[02:34:20.974 --> 02:34:22.255]  Candy and I have all four of them.
[02:34:22.898 --> 02:34:28.920]  But, I remember I would see the look in my daughter's eyes, like, Daddy, how come I can't come see you?
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:36.502]  And then I would, you know, remember the kids that I saw that with.
[02:34:37.342 --> 02:34:38.203]  That I did that to.
[02:34:38.803 --> 02:34:40.583]  And, you know, I left their house.
[02:34:41.284 --> 02:34:45.605]  But, you know, they're in their teenage years right now, but that didn't go away.
[02:34:45.865 --> 02:34:46.705]  It's terrorizing.
[02:34:46.845 --> 02:34:48.926]  I mean, I'm a big old guy, and I was scary then.
[02:34:49.784 --> 02:34:54.565]  And so were the people I worked with, and it was scary to watch us come crashing through your door.
[02:34:54.906 --> 02:35:02.728]  I remember watching men pee on themselves, grown men, the fathers, in sheer terror, just... And we thought it was funny!
[02:35:03.248 --> 02:35:07.489]  You know, the videographer that was with us, filming the raids, for legal purposes.
[02:35:08.089 --> 02:35:12.871]  We would go back to the office and laugh about how scared they were.
[02:35:14.295 --> 02:35:22.624]  You've seen the footage of them strip searching some woman who called the police and she's screaming, crying as they're pulling her panties off and the cops are laughing.
[02:35:23.445 --> 02:35:24.046]  They're sick.
[02:35:25.447 --> 02:35:27.469]  We have sick men in law enforcement.
[02:35:27.609 --> 02:35:35.098]  Well that's the thing about evil is that it starts slow but once you commit and make a joke about it, it just gets worse and worse and you go right off a cliff.
[02:35:35.838 --> 02:35:36.259]  That's right.
[02:35:38.757 --> 02:35:43.178]  Well, this has been one of the most amazing interviews, and I don't say this with most guests.
[02:35:43.198 --> 02:35:45.358]  This has been an amazing interview with Candy.
[02:35:45.798 --> 02:35:46.899]  I am so impressed.
[02:35:47.019 --> 02:35:49.699]  I am so impressed with everything you guys are doing.
[02:35:50.119 --> 02:35:56.740]  I am so impressed with Never Get Busted Again, NeverGetBusted.com, and everything you're doing, Barry Cooper.
[02:35:57.220 --> 02:35:58.321]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:35:58.501 --> 02:36:03.602]  And get ready with some outro music, guys, because we're going to end this here in just a few minutes.
[02:36:04.042 --> 02:36:05.242]  I do want to encourage everybody.
[02:36:05.982 --> 02:36:26.681]  To go to www.nevergetbusted.com and again we'll put that back up on screen and to get both these films and to spread the word about this website because I've seen his work over the years and I've just been so busy I kind of ignored it didn't get involved and and and then people kept emailing us saying have Barry Cooper on have him on have him on have him on have him on have him on and then I just said to my producer I said
[02:36:28.209 --> 02:36:35.316]  Get them on, and it was the perfect time when you were already in Austin, so maybe fate had it that I didn't do it from a distance so I could really be here with you in person.
[02:36:35.877 --> 02:36:41.662]  And as George Bush said about Putin, look into your eyes and see your soul, but you've got a good soul, not one like Mr. Putin.
[02:36:42.203 --> 02:36:43.204]  And you too, Candy.
[02:36:43.244 --> 02:36:45.366]  So this has just been just amazing.
[02:36:45.926 --> 02:36:47.027]  Us too, for us too.
[02:36:47.248 --> 02:36:48.849]  We love being here with you.
[02:36:49.250 --> 02:36:50.791]  Alright, well we're going to end this transmission.
[02:36:50.831 --> 02:36:51.532]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:36:52.577 --> 02:36:56.460]  Just peace, love, and never get busted.
[02:36:57.321 --> 02:37:05.748]  If you're going to travel with pot, never carry more than you can eat and go in the rain to avoid a cage.
[02:37:06.328 --> 02:37:06.929]  Absolutely.
[02:37:07.009 --> 02:37:07.349]  All right.
[02:37:07.369 --> 02:37:08.690]  Well, that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:09.070 --> 02:37:20.740]  In closing, I hope you'll visit InfoWars.com, the secure online shopping cart, to get films like Fabled Enemies, The Money Masters, about what the bankers are doing, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement,
