[00:00:02.148 --> 00:00:07.777]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:16.230]  Well, the Associated Press and Politico
[00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:20.669]  Have both reported in the last month that Obama has an enemies list.
[00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:22.649]  We know Bill Clinton had one.
[00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:32.251]  Now the Globe, which is about as good as the Enquirer, though they don't do Batboy and Aliens landing in Central Park, they claim that they have a White House source with the enemies list.
[00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:34.592]  I think this is a public threat to people.
[00:00:36.232 --> 00:00:39.193]  And we're going to be going over that after Ray McGovern leaves us.
[00:00:40.816 --> 00:00:46.118]  Ray McGovern is one of President Ronald Reagan's intelligence briefers from 81 to 85.
[00:00:46.738 --> 00:00:55.902]  He was in charge of preparing the daily security briefings for Reagan and Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush and the National Security Advisor, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Cabinet.
[00:00:56.902 --> 00:01:03.705]  Later, McGovern was one of several senior CIA analysts who prepared the President's daily briefing during the first Bush administration.
[00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:05.766]  He also famously challenged
[00:01:07.754 --> 00:01:13.177]  Then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at a press conference, where are the WMDs?
[00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:17.940]  And of course, the Defense Secretary said, I never said they had WMDs.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.063]  And he quoted Rumsfeld back and really devastated Rumsfeld.
[00:01:23.343 --> 00:01:30.267]  And that was really a turning point because Rumsfeld had been saying they had the WMDs and where they were in and around Tikrit.
[00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:31.468]  Then he had to back off.
[00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:34.236]  So I really respect Ray McGovern's analysis.
[00:01:34.736 --> 00:01:40.919]  He was also an infantry commander during the Vietnam era as well in the Army, if memory serves correctly.
[00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.802]  And he's been two years in remission from lymphatic cancer, so we're excited to have him here with us and doing better than ever.
[00:01:49.303 --> 00:01:51.023]  Joining us is Ray McGovern.
[00:01:51.323 --> 00:01:52.384]  Ray, good to have you here with us.
[00:01:52.644 --> 00:01:53.224]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:57.346]  Ray, from memory, don't you have a new book out too?
[00:01:58.427 --> 00:02:00.908]  Well, I don't write books because then I'd lose my wife.
[00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:05.198]  I heard somebody saying they heard you on Dallas radio about a book or something.
[00:02:05.398 --> 00:02:06.899]  Maybe you were talking about somebody else's book.
[00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:07.459]  Oh, I was.
[00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:14.763]  Yeah, I was talking about JFK and the Unspeakable, which is a book that people really should read.
[00:02:14.783 --> 00:02:28.731]  It's by James Douglas, and it goes over the most recently released data on the situation there in Dallas and elsewhere when John Kennedy was assassinated.
[00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:38.878]  You know, I had dinner with Martin Sheen about a month ago, and he said it was the best JFK book he had read and was raving about it.
[00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:40.800]  I forgot to get a copy of it.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.682]  He was going to give me a copy of it, but I forgot to get it.
[00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:45.784]  Why is everybody saying this book is so powerful?
[00:02:45.804 --> 00:02:48.046]  I mean, you're a former top CIA analyst.
[00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:50.168]  You're reading it yourself.
[00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:53.270]  I want to get into Iran, but that's a subject I've never raised with you.
[00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:56.393]  Is JFK, why are you so impressed with this book?
[00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:17.993]  Well, Alex, I have to confess that someone sent me that book about a year and a half ago, and as soon as I heard that it had this theory that it was the CIA, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and people who had been subordinated to the Secret Service that planned and executed the assassination of John Kennedy.
[00:03:18.013 --> 00:03:20.615]  As soon as I heard that, I said, well, this is pretty far out.
[00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:22.296]  I've got lots of articles to write.
[00:03:22.777 --> 00:03:25.259]  So I put it on my back shelf, but recently I'm
[00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:26.789]  I've been reading it.
[00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.330]  I've almost finished.
[00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:44.016]  And I share the view of those who have read it before and told me that it's the most painstakingly researched piece of work and that it includes the very latest data that's been released from FOIAs or from other things.
[00:03:44.496 --> 00:03:48.378]  He conducted incredible interviews with people on the spot.
[00:03:49.247 --> 00:03:58.671]  And the evidence that he adduces, and you know, I'm an intelligence analyst, so I know a little bit about this kind of thing, is very, very persuasive.
[00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:17.039]  And the reason that it has such current attention and applicability is because the very forces that Jim Douglas claims did JFK in are still very much around, are still very much
[00:04:18.414 --> 00:04:36.330]  Intimidating a new president, whose name happens to be Barack Obama, and if you just run down the line of things, it was Cuba, mostly, because JFK would not save the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.
[00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.515]  The CIA and the Joint Chiefs got very mad about that.
[00:04:42.358 --> 00:04:55.521]  When JFK wouldn't launch a nuclear war on the Soviet Union during the missile crisis in 1962, that got the Joint Chiefs really mad because they knew they had the advantage.
[00:04:55.581 --> 00:05:01.502]  And they told, look, Mr. President, it would only mean about 20 million of us killed, but we'd kill all the Russians.
[00:05:01.522 --> 00:05:03.043]  That kind of logic.
[00:05:03.323 --> 00:05:04.083]  That was L.L.
[00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:05.923]  Lemonsir and Curtis LeMay, wasn't it?
[00:05:06.023 --> 00:05:06.323]  Yeah.
[00:05:06.703 --> 00:05:09.304]  Yeah, it was that crowd.
[00:05:10.197 --> 00:05:15.880]  That crowd was described by George Ball, the Deputy Secretary of State, as a cesspool.
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.942]  They're the ones that planned things like Northwoods and other things.
[00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:29.766]  It's hard to put yourself back into those years, but there was such an incredible, visceral, knee-jerk anti-communism.
[00:05:30.487 --> 00:05:39.216]  That again, the Joint Chiefs thought it would be just fine if we did in all the Soviet Union in return to just, you know, maybe 20 million casualties here.
[00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:54.711]  John Kennedy faced into that, and not only that, but he started talking with Castro independently and secretly, he thought, because the CIA knew about it, and he had a private correspondence with Nikita Khrushchev.
[00:05:56.164 --> 00:06:00.646]  He made a big speech at American University saying, we ought to get along with the Soviet Union.
[00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:05.888]  And what do you know, but three months later, the Limited Test Pair Treaty is signed.
[00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:11.711]  The JCS, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was cut out of those negotiations.
[00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:15.612]  So you can understand how they felt about that.
[00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:22.235]  And last but not least was Vietnam, where John Kennedy was convinced it was a fool's errand.
[00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:24.512]  And he started issuing U.S.
[00:06:24.532 --> 00:06:30.536]  Greenbacks and was beginning to phase out the Federal Reserve and giving anti-Federal Reserve speeches.
[00:06:51.397 --> 00:06:53.598]  Yeah, he was running into lots of problems.
[00:06:53.658 --> 00:07:08.787]  And you know, when Dwight Eisenhower warned about the military-industrial complex, well, already what he was seeing was a military-industrial-congressional-media complex, which we have in full swing right now.
[00:07:09.347 --> 00:07:10.708]  And so he's really up against it.
[00:07:10.808 --> 00:07:14.430]  And so I admire him even more than I used to in facing right into that.
[00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.392]  And it's not at all difficult for me to believe anymore.
[00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:40.645]  That the people who both felt personally threatened and also felt that this fellow was selling out to the communists, took it upon themselves to plan this thing, carry it off, and then appoint people to investigate it, in quotes, who would come out with the best, the right conclusion, the politically correct conclusion that this
[00:07:42.325 --> 00:07:44.306]  Lee Harvey Oswald did it all alone.
[00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:46.307]  No one believes that anymore.
[00:07:46.867 --> 00:08:04.775]  So, you know, the applicability of this thing with, here's Barack Obama, his big de-ribboned and de-meddled general officers are telling him, ah, we're going to suffer defeat in Afghanistan if you don't give us 40,000, 45,000 more troops.
[00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:07.756]  That's exactly the same situation that Jay
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.821]  What about the secret Pentagon document that came out two weeks ago?
[00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:15.362]  Is there any validity to that from your research, Ray McGovern?
[00:08:15.782 --> 00:08:19.463]  Where they're saying they need 500,000 troops over the next five years?
[00:08:20.003 --> 00:08:33.027]  Well, you know, Andrea Mitchell ran with that and I was really surprised because all the information that subsequently emerged does not indicate that that document talked about 500,000.
[00:08:33.348 --> 00:08:37.889]  What I think people did, perhaps, was interpolate.
[00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:53.458]  They look at the ratio that the current army manual says, the ratio of troops to citizens that is necessary for a successful insurgency, and you multiply the numbers by the 38 million Afghans
[00:08:53.911 --> 00:09:03.639]  And you get, you know, 500,000 or more troops that would be... Yeah, that was the original... Secretary White told Bush, you need 500,000 or 450,000 to be technical.
[00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:05.400]  And Bush said, no, I can do it with 150.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.805]  And I guess there are 23 million in Iraq, so the ratio would be above 500,000, wouldn't it?
[00:09:12.246 --> 00:09:12.986]  Exactly right.
[00:09:13.527 --> 00:09:19.992]  And when you say 23 million in Iraq, I have to tell your listeners that there used to be 27 million in Iraq.
[00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:22.168]  That's
[00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:39.835]  I don't think so.
[00:09:54.835 --> 00:09:57.397]  Russia did not sneak attack Georgia, it was the other way around.
[00:09:58.437 --> 00:10:05.822]  Obama is doing the right thing, saying he's going to pull missile systems out, but then he's hedging his bets from what I've seen, saying maybe some new system down the road.
[00:10:06.602 --> 00:10:18.050]  So what you see happening in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the U.S.-Russian relationship, and where all this is going, and then of course the $64 million question I want to cover first.
[00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:23.324]  From what I've read, the Iranians said, okay, in a few months we're going to open this new facility.
[00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:24.304]  They announced it.
[00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:32.310]  Our media spun it and said, we found a secret location, and it looks to me like another big lie, or am I incorrect?
[00:10:33.471 --> 00:10:36.272]  Well, unfortunately, you're correct, Alex.
[00:10:37.393 --> 00:10:42.116]  What we have here is Iraq, part two.
[00:10:42.837 --> 00:10:47.200]  You remember how the, what I call the fawning corporate media,
[00:10:47.873 --> 00:10:55.678]  How they spun Iraq, so we were all led to believe that there were weapons of mass destruction there and ties between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda.
[00:10:56.019 --> 00:10:56.959]  None of that was right.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:05.465]  And none of the hype that's going on now with respect to the, quote, Iranian nuclear threat, end quote, is right.
[00:11:06.206 --> 00:11:13.811]  It's hyperbole to the nth degree, and people in Congress in particular are feeding, having a feeding frenzy.
[00:11:14.366 --> 00:11:19.287]  On things that they have so warped that the American citizen can't really understand what's going on.
[00:11:19.307 --> 00:11:19.387]  Okay.
[00:11:19.827 --> 00:11:21.808]  I'll try to put it in some context.
[00:11:22.368 --> 00:11:23.508]  Okay, do that after we go to break.
[00:11:23.528 --> 00:11:24.168]  We're going to come back.
[00:11:24.188 --> 00:11:25.208]  I'm going to give you the floor.
[00:11:25.748 --> 00:11:31.230]  I want you to break this down because I remember two and a half weeks ago the Iranians have got all these different sites.
[00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:36.711]  The UN admits it can't get uranium above 95% to make weapons.
[00:11:37.111 --> 00:11:39.271]  The Iranians announce, here's a new site we've got.
[00:11:39.972 --> 00:11:41.712]  And then the media hoaxes it.
[00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:43.754]  Saying they've got it.
[00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:44.695]  It was secret.
[00:11:44.755 --> 00:11:45.456]  We found it.
[00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:46.698]  Boy, we better attack them.
[00:11:47.078 --> 00:11:50.102]  Netanyahu's making secret trips to Russia to get green light.
[00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:52.385]  Russia starts saying we support sanctions.
[00:11:52.806 --> 00:11:53.787]  What's your intel?
[00:11:54.068 --> 00:11:55.990]  Does that mean Russia's gonna back an attack?
[00:11:56.331 --> 00:11:58.353]  We'll talk about it all with Ray McGovern.
[00:11:58.634 --> 00:11:59.275]  Straight ahead.
[00:11:59.335 --> 00:11:59.815]  Stay with us.
[00:12:01.531 --> 00:12:04.753]  Attention all US homeowners stuck in high interest rate mortgages.
[00:12:05.113 --> 00:12:08.535]  Are you finding it harder and harder to keep up with your monthly mortgage payments?
[00:12:08.835 --> 00:12:17.540]  Homeowners with all types of credit can now apply for FHA government-insured 30-year fixed rates as low as 4.875% from TopDot Mortgage.

[00:12:51.565 --> 00:12:52.587]  Topdot is a licensed mortgage banker.
[00:12:52.607 --> 00:12:53.589]  Rates based on an APR of 5.20%.
[00:13:00.808 --> 00:13:07.013]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:13:07.474 --> 00:13:15.240]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:23.468]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:13:23.768 --> 00:13:28.512]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:13:28.832 --> 00:13:33.534]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:13:34.054 --> 00:13:37.916]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:13:38.416 --> 00:13:39.417]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:13:39.497 --> 00:13:43.578]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:13:43.999 --> 00:13:48.380]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:13:48.901 --> 00:13:51.462]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:13:51.902 --> 00:13:53.543]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:56.724 --> 00:13:57.564]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:58.264 --> 00:14:01.825]  It is a big idea.
[00:14:01.845 --> 00:14:03.966]  A New World Order.
[00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:09.307]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:14:09.327 --> 00:14:11.728]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:14:12.388 --> 00:14:14.628]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.629]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:14:18.349 --> 00:14:25.671]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:14:28.717 --> 00:14:33.660]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:37.623]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:14:38.023 --> 00:14:40.505]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:14:40.585 --> 00:14:41.726]  Most people have no idea.
[00:14:41.746 --> 00:14:42.526]  They're not after money.
[00:14:42.546 --> 00:14:43.627]  They have all the money they need.
[00:14:43.807 --> 00:14:44.548]  They're after power.

[00:15:56.495 --> 00:15:58.263]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[00:16:07.372 --> 00:16:17.875]  Well, we have a former senior CIA analyst, Ray McGovern, whose information has proven over the years to be very, very accurate in hindsight, joining us.
[00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:32.600]  Okay, Ray, you were getting into what's really happening with Iran and these sites, and what you agreed is a big hoax, saying that it was a secret site and they're going to nuke us in 45 minutes, changing the last letter in Iraq to Iran.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.001]  Well, you got it, Alex.
[00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:36.022]  That's what's going on.
[00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:38.424]  It's hype that's really unconscionable.
[00:16:39.425 --> 00:17:01.443]  Let me go back a little ways here, because after the debacle on Iraq, when my former colleagues were visited several times by the Vice President, whose name is Cheney, and told to write a national intelligence estimate that said Saddam Hussein has all manner of weapons of mass destruction, that was October 1.
[00:17:04.868 --> 00:17:11.494]  After that happened, my former colleagues rose to the occasion and said, no more of that stuff.
[00:17:11.734 --> 00:17:12.995]  We're not going to do that anymore.
[00:17:13.096 --> 00:17:17.780]  We're going to tell the truth, which reverts back to the kind of atmosphere in which I worked.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:25.887]  The only place in town without a political agenda, the only place in town that can tell the president without fear or favor what we really think.
[00:17:26.556 --> 00:17:34.041]  Now, to make that clear, when people say, well, how come you torture people, they're basically two CIAs, alright?
[00:17:34.501 --> 00:17:47.929]  The one that obeys the President's wishes and is able to do that under the National Security Act of 1947, the one that goes off and kidnaps people and tortures people, that's not the CIA I worked in.
[00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:51.632]  I worked in the analysis part and the part of the covert
[00:17:52.933 --> 00:17:55.494]  agency that collected information, okay?
[00:17:55.814 --> 00:17:58.134]  And what I'm talking about now is that CIA.
[00:17:58.294 --> 00:17:58.974]  Now, what did we do?
[00:17:59.374 --> 00:18:02.555]  Well, we, okay, what did my former colleagues do?
[00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:18.198]  Well, what we did, to coin a phrase, is in 19, I'm sorry, 2006, we gave Bush and Cheney the finger, Tom finger, F-I-N-G-A-R,
[00:18:20.393 --> 00:18:34.123]  Who was an honest estimator, incredibly bright, came from the State Department and ran an estimate on Iran and its nuclear program, which is a bottom-up estimate.
[00:18:34.343 --> 00:18:38.827]  They spent months and months and months relooking at all the previous work.
[00:18:39.264 --> 00:18:44.646]  Taking into account the most recent information, they came up with some startling conclusions.
[00:18:45.106 --> 00:18:50.588]  Conclusions that were at direct variance with what President and Cheney have been telling the world, okay?
[00:18:50.728 --> 00:18:52.709]  Number one, the N.I.E.
[00:18:52.829 --> 00:18:59.091]  judged with, quote, high confidence, end quote, that Iran had halted, had stopped,
[00:18:59.858 --> 00:19:11.062]  A covert nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003, and had not resumed work on this nuclear weapons aspect of its program.
[00:19:11.462 --> 00:19:14.303]  This is an essential part of a nuclear program.
[00:19:14.603 --> 00:19:24.026]  They stopped work on it, and the latest briefing of Congress indicates that the CIA believes, and the intelligence community as well, that they did not restart this.
[00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:29.048]  So this is a very curious way to be, as Defense Secretary Gates says,
[00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:36.416]  Hellbent on developing a nuclear weapon if you stopped, let's see what's the math here, six years ago, okay?
[00:19:36.917 --> 00:19:44.525]  And sir, didn't they say at the time, in the highly publicized report, that if Iran restarted it, it would take nine years?
[00:19:45.365 --> 00:20:01.560]  Well, they said 2015 or so, it was kind of a bracketed thing, and it all depended on how quickly they could enrich uranium to the weapons grade, and also what kind of delivery system they could get.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.681]  Now, no one
[00:20:03.075 --> 00:20:13.058]  No one, from a technical point of view, said that Iran could be a threat to the United States in any time frame soon.
[00:20:13.138 --> 00:20:21.601]  They have no ICBMs, they have no method of delivering a weapon, even if they restarted their work on weapons.
[00:20:22.342 --> 00:20:23.862]  To whom are they a threat?
[00:20:24.602 --> 00:20:31.325]  Well, there's one other country in that region who actually has about 200
[00:20:32.543 --> 00:20:42.845]  Some people say 300 nuclear weapons deliverable by aircraft, by submarines, by surface ships, by missile.
[00:20:43.445 --> 00:20:45.326]  And the name of that country is Israel.
[00:20:46.086 --> 00:20:50.487]  And no one should shy away from mentioning that because that is the fly in the ointment.
[00:20:51.267 --> 00:20:59.889]  If there's a country in that region that has not signed a non-proliferation agreement,
[00:21:00.595 --> 00:21:10.302]  And has this kind of capability and the United States shows itself willing to invade a country like Iraq without that capability.
[00:21:10.763 --> 00:21:17.088]  Well, if I were an Iranian, you know, I would think long and hard about being able to have the option to have that capability.
[00:21:17.648 --> 00:21:22.852]  And so this estimate, this estimate said, we don't know whether the Iranians
[00:21:23.644 --> 00:21:24.625]  Right, got him right.
[00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:40.987]  Long segment coming up.
[00:21:41.027 --> 00:21:41.968]  We'll continue there.
[00:21:42.329 --> 00:21:43.710]  Look at the latest hype.
[00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:46.193]  Iran announces they've got a facility.
[00:21:46.213 --> 00:21:48.836]  The media spins it and says we found a secret facility.
[00:21:49.177 --> 00:21:50.158]  We've got to attack.
[00:21:50.258 --> 00:21:50.898]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:52.320]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.801 --> 00:21:54.402]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:55.344 --> 00:21:58.027]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.606 --> 00:22:04.588]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:22:04.848 --> 00:22:06.629]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:22:06.849 --> 00:22:15.133]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:22:15.373 --> 00:22:20.596]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:22:20.916 --> 00:22:22.537]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:22:22.777 --> 00:22:29.121]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:22:29.301 --> 00:22:40.048]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:22:40.349 --> 00:22:40.849]  That's right.
[00:22:41.129 --> 00:22:43.431]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[00:22:47.833 --> 00:23:05.860]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.940]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.341]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:10.501 --> 00:23:12.362]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:12.782 --> 00:23:14.122]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:14.403 --> 00:23:15.443]  There is a solution.
[00:23:15.663 --> 00:23:23.687]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:24:04.832 --> 00:24:06.234]  Will the life change tea help me?
[00:24:06.515 --> 00:24:07.918]  Our answer is always the same.
[00:24:08.362 --> 00:24:14.044]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water, and air are attacking you this very moment.
[00:24:14.484 --> 00:24:19.986]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[00:24:20.386 --> 00:24:24.608]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[00:24:24.868 --> 00:24:25.868]  We use results.
[00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:30.750]  Life Change Tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:35.332]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[00:24:35.652 --> 00:24:39.133]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[00:24:39.533 --> 00:24:42.994]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[00:24:43.414 --> 00:24:47.915]  Our number is 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.

[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:32.701]  Going back to Ray McGovern in just one moment as we continue to get a briefing from him, honored to have him, on what's really going on.
[00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:37.002]  And he's one of the main people that came out and said the WMD thing is all a lie in Iraq.
[00:25:37.742 --> 00:25:42.083]  The yellow tubes, or the aluminum tubes, the yellow cake from Niger, all of it.
[00:25:42.918 --> 00:25:44.983]  And then now we know in hindsight it was all lies.
[00:25:45.123 --> 00:25:47.207]  And they literally are running the same playbook again.
[00:25:47.528 --> 00:25:52.479]  We'll talk to Ray McGovern in a moment, also talk about Russia, talk about Afghanistan, Pakistan.
[00:25:53.593 --> 00:26:00.195]  And to get his view on where all that is going, before we do that, I want to remind listeners you can pre-order now my new film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:26:00.255 --> 00:26:04.616]  It ships on DVD on or before October 21st, just three weeks from now.
[00:26:04.636 --> 00:26:12.398]  This covers the banks, how they control both parties, how they've mesmerized the population, how they're recruiting Stasi forces within the United States.
[00:26:12.458 --> 00:26:13.418]  It's all documented.
[00:26:14.258 --> 00:26:18.241]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss, Fall of the Republic.
[00:26:18.561 --> 00:26:20.302]  Available at InfoWars.com.

[00:26:25.506 --> 00:26:27.487]  The technology's really gotten small and inexpensive.
[00:26:27.727 --> 00:26:30.409]  They have a small chip recording in them with a tiny camera.
[00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:35.893]  No wires, where you can surveil, defend yourself when the police pull you over.
[00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:38.414]  It's got timecode stamps, so it's good in court.
[00:26:38.454 --> 00:26:41.917]  They have pins that have high quality video and audio now.

[00:26:58.033 --> 00:26:58.994]  Okay, going back to Ray McGovern.
[00:26:59.014 --> 00:27:00.334]  Ray, you'd left off with the CIA assessment
[00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:22.231]  2006, and then now we fast forward to they've taken some troops out of Iraq, replaced them with contractors, put 20,000 to 30,000 more troops and contractors in Afghanistan.
[00:27:22.251 --> 00:27:26.194]  They're saying on the news, we caught a secret nuke factory.
[00:27:26.415 --> 00:27:27.195]  We caught them.
[00:27:27.235 --> 00:27:27.976]  We caught them.
[00:27:28.216 --> 00:27:28.937]  It's incredible.
[00:27:28.957 --> 00:27:31.859]  And then a few days later, oh, did we catch them?
[00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:34.281]  Well, they made the announcement after they knew we knew.
[00:27:35.242 --> 00:27:37.624]  So, so, so break down what's really happening today.
[00:27:38.069 --> 00:27:38.289]  Yeah.
[00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:52.858]  Well, we caught them several, several months ago, Alex, and they announced the existence of this new enrichment plant on their own initiative.
[00:27:52.978 --> 00:27:57.501]  And they did that just a week before the negotiations start.
[00:27:58.061 --> 00:28:07.487]  Your listeners perhaps need to be reminded that tomorrow is a very big day because the five Security Council members plus Germany and Iran are getting together
[00:28:08.098 --> 00:28:11.220]  Talk about the Iranian nuclear program.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.703]  Now, that's why the hype is the pitch that it is.
[00:28:15.723 --> 00:28:24.268]  They're trying to, the media here, are trying to hype this thing up and say, well, look, now we've discovered a new enrichment facility.
[00:28:24.288 --> 00:28:27.490]  Well, we know about that enrichment facility for months.
[00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:34.734]  And now the Iranians are claiming that they're well within their rights under the treaties governing this kind of activity.
[00:28:35.134 --> 00:28:35.454]  I think so.
[00:28:52.242 --> 00:28:56.706]  Iran is years and years away from a nuclear weapon.
[00:28:57.006 --> 00:28:58.307]  Okay, I'll repeat that one more time.
[00:28:58.487 --> 00:29:00.329]  Years away from a nuclear weapon.
[00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:01.650]  Don't believe the hype.
[00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.611]  Don't believe what the Israelis are saying.
[00:29:03.911 --> 00:29:05.633]  These are technical questions, okay?
[00:29:06.243 --> 00:29:10.867]  Now, when I did the President's Daily Brief, I didn't write all the briefs, obviously.
[00:29:10.887 --> 00:29:22.275]  I know who the good analysts were, the honest, technical people, and it was a privilege to put their stuff in readable form and give it to the President.
[00:29:22.575 --> 00:29:26.578]  Well, now I still know those folks, and I'm not getting this from a government head.
[00:29:26.618 --> 00:29:33.403]  I'm getting it from people like Greg Kielman, who ran the State Department, the INR, the research there.
[00:29:34.488 --> 00:29:37.090]  The intelligence outfit of the State Department was right.
[00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:42.974]  His people were right before the Iraq estimate there in 2002.
[00:29:43.534 --> 00:29:46.056]  And he now writes for the Arms Control Association.
[00:29:46.656 --> 00:29:48.418]  And it's the best stuff out there.
[00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:53.421]  Just Google Arms Control Association, you'll see what Greg Tielman is putting together.
[00:29:54.033 --> 00:29:55.553]  Alright, boil it down for us then.
[00:29:55.653 --> 00:29:58.014]  What does Iran really have?
[00:29:58.214 --> 00:29:59.114]  What are they really doing?
[00:29:59.274 --> 00:30:01.515]  And A, why can Israel have weapons?
[00:30:01.575 --> 00:30:02.935]  Why can Pakistan have weapons?
[00:30:02.975 --> 00:30:03.996]  Why is that okay?
[00:30:04.396 --> 00:30:08.297]  But Iran's nowhere near it, and we're hearing, we gotta put sanctions on them!
[00:30:08.497 --> 00:30:11.358]  We gotta attack them!
[00:30:11.418 --> 00:30:12.698]  They could kill us any minute!
[00:30:13.838 --> 00:30:20.400]  Well, Alex, it will be no news to you that there is something in this country that I call the Likud Lobby.
[00:30:21.132 --> 00:30:30.337]  Well, the Kud being the hard right faction of the Israeli government, Israeli parties, and they have an ordinate influence in this country.
[00:30:30.357 --> 00:30:37.041]  And if you were to ask why it is that Congress is preparing, actually preparing as we speak,
[00:30:37.873 --> 00:30:46.458]  To pass a law that would actually be an act of war to interdict the supply of gasoline and such products to Iran.
[00:30:46.558 --> 00:30:47.499]  Why are they doing that?
[00:30:47.659 --> 00:30:55.163]  Well, it's because a lot of their money and a lot of their votes come from what I call the Likud lobby.
[00:30:56.104 --> 00:30:58.766]  But why does Israel want to attack Iran?
[00:30:59.226 --> 00:31:02.788]  Well, you know, if you look at the Israelis and their frame of mind,
[00:31:04.778 --> 00:31:07.860]  And I think it's a terribly myopic frame of mind.
[00:31:08.341 --> 00:31:12.684]  I care about what happens to Israel, and I think it's exactly the wrong policy.
[00:31:12.844 --> 00:31:29.996]  They think that if they can zap the Iranian nuclear facility, as they did to the facility in Osirak in Iraq in 1983, then they could set the Iranians back, oh, five, ten years, perhaps, if they're allowed to do that.
[00:31:30.618 --> 00:31:37.159]  Now, that's very myopic, because the Iranians, unlike the Iraqis in those days, the Iranians can retaliate.
[00:31:37.379 --> 00:31:38.800]  They can close the straits.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.300]  They can decimate our troops in Iraq.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.341]  And they can hit Israeli cities even now.
[00:31:46.421 --> 00:31:49.641]  Not with a nuclear weapon, but with lots of missiles, okay?
[00:31:49.681 --> 00:31:52.142]  So, it would be bedlam if this happened.
[00:31:52.262 --> 00:31:56.163]  And yet, the Israelis are trying to get ROK to let them do it.
[00:31:56.503 --> 00:31:57.863]  This is lunacy.
[00:31:58.413 --> 00:32:01.156]  But they have this kind of frame of mind.
[00:32:01.436 --> 00:32:08.943]  Netanyahu, their Prime Minister in particular, that this must not be let happen and that they're going to delay it as long as they can.
[00:32:09.023 --> 00:32:11.885]  If it takes an armed strike, they'll do it.
[00:32:12.145 --> 00:32:18.591]  Now, the only thing that is preventing them from doing it at this point, in my estimation, is this.
[00:32:19.632 --> 00:32:24.817]  Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is responsible for our troops and our security,
[00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:31.453]  has gone over to Israel, this time last year, and said, look, don't even think about it, okay?
[00:32:31.733 --> 00:32:37.637]  You fly your planes over our airspace in Iraq, we're going to shoot them down, okay?
[00:32:37.837 --> 00:32:48.163]  So don't even think about this, and don't think you can perpetrate the kind of incident like the Liberty incident back in June of 68, because we remember that.
[00:32:48.383 --> 00:32:51.225]  I'm a naval officer, and that's just not going to happen again.
[00:32:51.785 --> 00:32:52.906]  Now, that was pretty gutsy.
[00:32:53.556 --> 00:32:57.599]  And that put the kibosh on what the Israelis were planning the following August.
[00:32:57.899 --> 00:33:00.340]  Not last August, but August of 2008.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.521]  Let me go back.
[00:33:02.441 --> 00:33:05.523]  We had the Admiral you just talked about.
[00:33:05.543 --> 00:33:07.985]  And then it leaked.
[00:33:10.226 --> 00:33:12.708]  It also leaked that
[00:33:13.786 --> 00:33:17.909]  And a New Yorker covered it, MSNBC covered it, Cy Hirsch talked about it.
[00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:21.972]  We'd all heard about how these radio calls were coming in.
[00:33:22.532 --> 00:33:26.355]  Iranian patrol boats attack, blow up the destroyers near the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:33:26.976 --> 00:33:27.756]  They're in the Gulf.
[00:33:28.377 --> 00:33:32.760]  And then it came out later that Cheney was discussing plans to paint up U.S.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.123]  ships like Iranian patrol boats and have them attack our ships.
[00:33:37.163 --> 00:33:38.624]  Now, this came out a
[00:33:41.545 --> 00:33:51.070]  Year after you on this show and other shows said, what I'm hearing from intelligence sources is, they may attack our ships and blame it on Iran.
[00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.191]  Were you being given specifics?
[00:33:53.711 --> 00:33:59.494]  Because it's one thing to get this from Sy Hersh a year after it happened, now two years ago.
[00:33:59.974 --> 00:34:05.497]  It's another thing for you, and I remember the interviews a year before, to say that's what you were concerned about.
[00:34:06.206 --> 00:34:10.109]  Well, Alex, I wish I could brag about an inside source on this particular thing.
[00:34:10.229 --> 00:34:10.789]  I cannot.
[00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:15.132]  I was using what we in Army Intelligence used to call a swag factor.
[00:34:15.152 --> 00:34:16.573]  You know what that is?
[00:34:16.873 --> 00:34:17.073]  No.
[00:34:17.633 --> 00:34:19.474]  That's a scientific wild ass guess.
[00:34:21.696 --> 00:34:25.298]  So it's thin slicing or it's dead reckoning?
[00:34:25.698 --> 00:34:29.421]  Yeah, it's, you know, trying to put yourself in the position of the Israelis.
[00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:38.640]  And what success they had with the incident there where they killed the 34 of our seamen there and wounded 171 in June 8, 1967.
[00:34:43.101 --> 00:34:55.353]  And, you know, talk about Moxie or Chutzpah, they were quite capable of doing that again, particularly if they had an ally in the Vice President of the United States, which clearly they did.
[00:34:55.913 --> 00:35:00.317]  And when Cy Hirsch came out with that a year later, you can imagine my reaction.
[00:35:00.377 --> 00:35:02.760]  I said, wow, that was a good guess, McGovern.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.082]  But it was just, at that point, a guess.
[00:35:05.962 --> 00:35:10.123]  Okay, we had Bayer on, the former CIA fellow for folks that don't know.
[00:35:10.143 --> 00:35:10.823]  Bayer?
[00:35:11.363 --> 00:35:26.346]  Yeah, and he said two years ago, and I don't trust him as much as I trust you, for obvious reasons, but he said, I'm worried about the Saudis staging a false flag to blame it on Iran.
[00:35:27.027 --> 00:35:32.748]  And then now, we see more and more similar things coming out along those lines.
[00:35:32.788 --> 00:35:33.648]  What's your take on that?
[00:35:34.312 --> 00:35:39.977]  Well, Bob knows the area a lot better than I do, and I have great confidence in his judgment.
[00:35:39.997 --> 00:35:50.226]  You know, the Saudis or Sunni, the Iranians or Shia, it may seem like lunacy to us, but it matters a great deal in that area.
[00:35:50.706 --> 00:35:56.411]  And for the Iranians to become the preponderant power in that area, well, the Saudis don't like that at all.
[00:35:56.451 --> 00:35:59.374]  Whether they would resort to this kind of provocation or not,
[00:36:00.014 --> 00:36:05.536]  You know, I don't know, but Bob would be in a much better position to speculate on that.
[00:36:06.736 --> 00:36:17.400]  Well, I mean, what is it like for you, knowing the region, studying it, when they get up on the news and say Iran is backing Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, when it's the opposite group?
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:24.042]  See, Shunni are archenemies, you know, they fight more than they do with Christians or Jews, really, if you look at the statistics that I've looked at.
[00:36:24.662 --> 00:36:30.127]  I mean, that's like saying the Dallas Cowboys are the New York Giants.
[00:36:30.167 --> 00:36:32.529]  I mean, it's clearly two different groups.
[00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:41.517]  And then the famous case two and a half years ago with the president of Afghanistan and Bush says, yes, Iran is funding Taliban and Al Qaeda.
[00:36:42.017 --> 00:36:42.257]  Yeah.
[00:37:03.021 --> 00:37:09.625]  Well, in answer to your question, Alex, I take this blood pressure medicine now, so this kind of stuff.
[00:37:10.186 --> 00:37:25.556]  But all kidding aside, you know, when Bush was allowed to mischaracterize, maybe a nice way of saying things, all these very important developments, and the mainstream press, people like Charlie Gibson, would just kind of say,
[00:37:27.666 --> 00:37:37.788]  I refer specifically to Bush's famous exit interview where Charlie Gibson finally said, well, Mr. President, why did you really think you had to attack Iraq?
[00:37:38.068 --> 00:37:38.989]  And he said, oh, it's simple.
[00:37:39.849 --> 00:37:41.909]  Saddam Hussein wouldn't let the UN inspectors in.
[00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:44.950]  And Charlie Gibson said, oh, okay.
[00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.150]  And he goes on to the next question, you know?
[00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:49.291]  But he was letting the inspectors in.
[00:37:50.538 --> 00:37:54.843]  They were combing through his palaces, they were interviewing his scientists one-on-one.
[00:37:54.863 --> 00:37:57.726]  It was George Bush that threw the U.N.
[00:37:57.786 --> 00:38:00.449]  inspectors out two days before shock and awe.
[00:38:00.869 --> 00:38:02.751]  And Charlie Gibson let's get away with that.
[00:38:03.212 --> 00:38:04.393]  Let's get back to Iran.
[00:38:05.474 --> 00:38:06.976]  I told you about the estimate here.
[00:38:07.016 --> 00:38:08.938]  It actually appeared in November of 2007.
[00:38:09.659 --> 00:38:10.880]  They started working on it in 2006.
[00:38:12.001 --> 00:38:16.525]  And so November 07, this big shock, namely, that the N.I.E.
[00:38:16.585 --> 00:38:27.153]  judges, and I used to chair these things, so I know what kind of work goes into this, high confidence that Tehran has halted a covert nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003.
[00:38:27.293 --> 00:38:29.975]  What does the President say the following March?
[00:38:30.706 --> 00:38:40.292]  He says, quote, Iran has declared that it wants to be a nuclear power with a weapon to destroy people, including others in the Middle East, end quote.
[00:38:42.154 --> 00:38:43.354]  You know, that's made up.
[00:38:43.995 --> 00:38:47.377]  You know, you make that kind of stuff up, but you shouldn't be allowed to get away with it.
[00:38:47.737 --> 00:38:49.559]  Iran never declared any such thing.
[00:38:50.019 --> 00:38:56.203]  As a matter of fact, the intelligence people were telling the president that Iran had ceased work on the nuclear weapon.
[00:38:56.443 --> 00:38:57.704]  And now they're hyping that again.
[00:38:57.764 --> 00:39:05.910]  I was watching CNN this morning and they cut to some female, blonde-haired comedian, I missed her name, as if it was news.
[00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.432]  They go, let's cut to see what she says about Iran.
[00:39:08.772 --> 00:39:13.195]  She's like, Ahmed Dinejad, how dare you say you want to nuke us and blow everything up?
[00:39:13.435 --> 00:39:14.136]  How dare you?
[00:39:14.176 --> 00:39:16.397]  We see through you, little man, little devil.
[00:39:16.737 --> 00:39:17.698]  And then she laughs.
[00:39:17.838 --> 00:39:19.900]  And I'm like, this is news now?
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.882]  When they always distort what he says,
[00:39:23.522 --> 00:39:26.363]  And I'm certainly not defending him or the Mulas or any of them over there.
[00:39:26.643 --> 00:39:30.584]  The point is, is that it's all being manufactured again.
[00:39:30.624 --> 00:39:31.804]  They're beating the war drums.
[00:39:33.084 --> 00:39:33.885]  Here's the big issue.
[00:39:34.145 --> 00:39:39.746]  Do you think they're going to hit them, or will it be sanctions first, or will they false flag, or where is this going?
[00:39:41.246 --> 00:39:49.188]  Well, it depends on how staunchly the only reputable institution in our government stands up to this.
[00:39:50.068 --> 00:39:52.329]  I have a lot of admiration for Admiral Mullen.
[00:39:54.202 --> 00:40:12.649]  I think that he's inclined and knee-jerk to obey orders, but he and his predecessor, Admiral Fallon, you remember Fallon quit when he was CENTCOM commander because he had said, we're not going to do Iran on my watch, and it took several months.
[00:40:13.539 --> 00:40:14.799]  Because he knows what'll happen.
[00:40:14.839 --> 00:40:18.620]  We should talk about what'll happen, the three different scenarios if Iran gets hit.
[00:40:18.841 --> 00:40:19.841]  That's exactly right.
[00:40:19.981 --> 00:40:26.903]  And one of them, you know, one of them says, well, Iran has the capability of closing the Straits of Hormuz.
[00:40:27.063 --> 00:40:33.405]  Now, okay, that's where, like, two-thirds of the oil that comes out of the oil-rich Middle East has to come through, okay?
[00:40:33.445 --> 00:40:36.586]  Now, what's Mullen say to that question?
[00:40:36.626 --> 00:40:37.646]  He says, yes,
[00:40:38.365 --> 00:40:43.448]  The Iranians have the capability of closing the straits, but, but we can reopen them.
[00:40:44.169 --> 00:40:44.609]  Well, yeah.
[00:40:45.129 --> 00:40:46.150]  How are they going to reopen them?
[00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:51.613]  Send a Marine Division into the cliffs overlooking the Straits of Hormuz?
[00:40:51.973 --> 00:40:53.735]  Give me a break, where are you going to get them?
[00:40:53.755 --> 00:40:55.776]  When they've got 12,000 sunburned missiles aiming down.
[00:40:55.916 --> 00:40:58.457]  Yeah, and where is he going to get the Marine Division?
[00:40:58.538 --> 00:41:05.542]  They're all, they're all already exhausted in Afghanistan and some of them left in Iraq, so.
[00:41:06.144 --> 00:41:30.496]  You know, this all has a degree of unreality, and when I see Senator Kit Bond of Missouri and John Kyle talking about, we need regime change, we need regime change in Iran because there's such a threat to Israel, well, you know, that just reminds me of the old saw about, you know, when they offered to make Israel the 51st state of the United States, Israel refused.
[00:41:30.917 --> 00:41:31.577]  You know why, Alex?
[00:41:31.837 --> 00:41:33.018]  Well, now why?
[00:41:33.498 --> 00:41:35.479]  Because then they'd only have two senators.
[00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:41.954]  Oh man, you know, this is just insane.
[00:41:43.236 --> 00:41:44.918]  So what's the intel you're getting?
[00:41:44.978 --> 00:41:48.384]  Are they planning to hit Iran or are they just going to have sanctions?
[00:41:48.824 --> 00:41:49.605]  Where is this going?
[00:41:50.286 --> 00:41:52.931]  I think Netanyahu is chafing at the bit.
[00:41:54.562 --> 00:42:12.024]  And I think Obama is under great pressure from the Likud lobby and from those still in the White House who have great difficulty distinguishing between what they perceive to be the strategic interests of Israel on the one hand and those of the United States on the other.
[00:42:13.058 --> 00:42:15.720]  I hope, and that's what it is, a hope.
[00:42:16.101 --> 00:42:21.545]  It's just a little bit more than, a little less than an expectation that Obama will stand up to this.
[00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:23.867]  This would be a ruinous war.
[00:42:23.947 --> 00:42:28.090]  This would be worse than the way he contemplates doing in Afghanistan.
[00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.111]  This would be bedlam.
[00:42:29.191 --> 00:42:33.975]  And I think that as long as he listens to people like Paul, that he'll be restrained.
[00:42:35.997 --> 00:42:38.038]  Final segment with Ryan McGovern straight ahead.
[00:42:38.058 --> 00:42:42.402]  I want to get his take on the Russia situation, where he thinks Afghanistan's going.
[00:42:44.113 --> 00:42:46.056]  I just wish we could stop having all these wars.
[00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:48.819]  I mean, our government has overthrown Iran repeatedly.
[00:42:48.839 --> 00:42:51.663]  They're constantly meddling inside their nation.
[00:42:52.184 --> 00:42:54.126]  We've really done this country wrong, folks.
[00:42:54.827 --> 00:42:56.389]  And now they're saying they're gonna nuke us.
[00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:58.292]  I mean, it's just pure bull.
[00:43:04.102 --> 00:43:07.264]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:43:07.605 --> 00:43:09.526]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:43:09.926 --> 00:43:17.592]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:43:18.252 --> 00:43:25.297]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:43:25.717 --> 00:43:32.542]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:43:33.078 --> 00:43:34.038]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:44:03.328 --> 00:44:08.150]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:17.334]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[00:44:18.194 --> 00:44:20.075]  Rely on OxySilver instead.
[00:44:21.047 --> 00:44:26.408]  OxySilver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:44:26.908 --> 00:44:29.629]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[00:44:30.169 --> 00:44:31.890]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:37.151]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[00:44:37.431 --> 00:44:40.712]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:44:41.192 --> 00:44:42.812]  So get it while you still can.
[00:44:43.412 --> 00:44:46.213]  Order OxySilver online at OxySilver.com.

[00:45:00.636 --> 00:45:02.136]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:45:02.336 --> 00:45:03.776]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:45:04.076 --> 00:45:06.297]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:45:06.757 --> 00:45:11.458]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:45:11.883 --> 00:45:14.746]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:46:15.869 --> 00:46:24.216]  Ray McGovern is our guest.
[00:46:24.256 --> 00:46:24.997]  Final segment.
[00:46:25.857 --> 00:46:27.979]  Ray, what about the rest of the world, geopolitically?
[00:46:28.019 --> 00:46:28.580]  What's going on?
[00:46:30.001 --> 00:46:35.445]  Well, what's going on is the rest of the world is looking at us and kind of shaking its head.
[00:46:36.746 --> 00:46:40.309]  The Russians and the Chinese and the Indians are the big players, of course.
[00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:43.372]  As they watch what we're trying to do in Afghanistan,
[00:46:44.202 --> 00:46:49.563]  You know, they're sort of shrugging their shoulders and saying, well, be our guest.
[00:46:49.843 --> 00:46:52.364]  You know, we all tried that in Afghanistan.
[00:46:52.804 --> 00:47:03.126]  We all failed going back to, you know, going back to the great, not to mention Chinggis Khan and the Persians and the Indians and the British and the Russians.
[00:47:03.786 --> 00:47:07.007]  Go ahead, you know, waste your military.
[00:47:07.762 --> 00:47:17.084]  And with respect to Iran, you know, the Russians used to care a great deal about what happened on their soft southern underbelly.
[00:47:17.764 --> 00:47:21.805]  But they seem almost cavalier with respect to Iranian plans.
[00:47:22.365 --> 00:47:30.147]  And I think part of that has to do with the fact that they don't have Israel as their, quote, ally, end quote.
[00:47:30.836 --> 00:47:32.037]  Now, what are these quotes?
[00:47:32.437 --> 00:47:38.582]  Well, because 99% of the American people believe that Israel is an ally of the United States.
[00:47:38.722 --> 00:47:39.322]  That's wrong.
[00:47:40.083 --> 00:47:41.844]  An alliance requires a treaty.
[00:47:42.245 --> 00:47:45.867]  There is no mutual defense treaty between the United States and Israel.
[00:47:46.268 --> 00:47:53.193]  And the reason there is none is because treaties require internationally recognized boundaries.
[00:47:53.832 --> 00:48:07.921]  And Israel is in possession for over 60 years now, no, 60 years from 1967 on till now, whatever the math is, of the occupied territories, West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.
[00:48:08.541 --> 00:48:16.146]  And Israel, the last thing it wants is to have any international body draw the borders back to where they used to be.
[00:48:16.206 --> 00:48:19.668]  So there is no alliance, and yet we proceed.
[00:48:20.728 --> 00:48:24.513]  The media characterizes our relationship with Israel as an alliance.
[00:48:24.853 --> 00:48:26.756]  Our policymakers treat it that way.
[00:48:27.016 --> 00:48:27.577]  But Russia?
[00:48:28.118 --> 00:48:36.609]  Russia sits back and laughs and says, well, if they do something really idiotic, if they close the Straits of Hormuz, guess who benefits?
[00:48:37.813 --> 00:48:38.393]  Who benefits?
[00:48:38.693 --> 00:48:39.074]  Russia.
[00:48:39.514 --> 00:48:41.375]  Russia's got all the oil, you know?
[00:48:41.635 --> 00:48:49.398]  Man, at the price of oil, you know, we'll be able to have a villa, we'll have a dacha for each little worker in Russia.
[00:48:49.418 --> 00:48:55.361]  Is that why Russia met with Netanyahu secretly a month ago and has now said they support sanctions against Iran?
[00:48:55.701 --> 00:48:58.222]  Well, you know, Russia plays a very clever game.
[00:48:58.322 --> 00:49:02.264]  You know, they express concern about this and then they go ahead.
[00:49:02.364 --> 00:49:03.625]  Now, with Netanyahu,
[00:49:05.095 --> 00:49:09.698]  They are restraining influence, although they don't care as much as we do.
[00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:29.848]  So when Netanyahu goes up there, what you expect him to get is not approval for a strike on Iran, but some sort of reassurance that, for example, the Russians won't sell sophisticated missiles to defend the Iranian sites there, the enrichment sites.
[00:49:31.363 --> 00:49:39.375]  You know, last year Ehud Olmert went to Moscow and he was summoned there.
[00:49:39.675 --> 00:49:47.767]  And the Russians warned him in similarly definitive terms, like Admiral Mullen, don't even think of attacking Iran.
[00:49:48.365 --> 00:49:58.917]  So the Russians have no real incentive for that kind of attack, but if it happens, you know, they're going to be the big beneficiary by doubling the price of their oil.
[00:49:58.937 --> 00:49:59.537]  Got to cut you off.
[00:49:59.557 --> 00:50:00.939]  We're almost out of time in the last minute.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.261]  Do you think it's sanctions or an attack?
[00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:08.026]  I mean, if you had to make a dead reckoning again, do you think they're going to hit Iran the next year or two?
[00:50:08.969 --> 00:50:11.551]  Uh, gosh, uh, I don't know, Alex.
[00:50:11.731 --> 00:50:13.632]  It will depend on how this thing plays out.
[00:50:13.652 --> 00:50:28.020]  There will be sanctions first, uh, but, uh, there's great pressure for an attack, and I would not rule out the likelihood that Israel would be given a nod by somebody in the White House and go ahead and do it and force our hand.
[00:50:29.121 --> 00:50:31.102]  And then Iran will go absolutely wild.
[00:50:31.462 --> 00:50:35.965]  Oh, yeah, it'll be bedlam, and we'll suffer great attrition for our own troops in the area.
[00:50:36.738 --> 00:50:38.099]  Ray McGovern, thank you for your time.
[00:50:38.119 --> 00:50:39.060]  You're most welcome.
[00:50:42.663 --> 00:50:44.745]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:45.286 --> 00:50:48.449]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.602]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:50:54.062 --> 00:50:57.223]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:50:57.684 --> 00:51:02.046]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:51:02.266 --> 00:51:07.869]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[00:51:08.149 --> 00:51:12.632]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:51:12.913 --> 00:51:15.955]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:51:16.535 --> 00:51:20.958]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:51:21.359 --> 00:51:27.663]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:51:27.923 --> 00:51:29.845]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:51:30.345 --> 00:51:33.167]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:51:33.548 --> 00:51:37.611]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:51:38.051 --> 00:51:39.733]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:51:39.773 --> 00:51:40.213]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:40.233 --> 00:51:40.273]  877-327-0365.
[00:51:40.293 --> 00:51:40.814]  Don't wait.
[00:51:40.834 --> 00:51:41.394]  Call today.
[00:51:41.454 --> 00:51:42.495]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:42.555 --> 00:51:43.776]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:04.701 --> 00:52:04.861]  Yeah.
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:34.707]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, already in the fourth and final hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:52:35.328 --> 00:52:36.970]  Wednesday, the 30th day of September 2009.
[00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:44.099]  Wanted to give you Ray McGovern's perspective on the Iran situation.
[00:52:45.521 --> 00:52:47.163]  We just got that from him.
[00:52:48.376 --> 00:52:50.618]  Gonna be getting into how we are on the enemies list.
[00:52:50.658 --> 00:52:55.303]  Some new developments from Hardin, Montana as well.
[00:52:56.324 --> 00:53:02.610]  With a fellow that's been doing some in-depth research there that is coming up in the next segment.
[00:53:06.333 --> 00:53:07.975]  We've got several Hardin clips.
[00:53:07.995 --> 00:53:08.936]  Which one do we have first?
[00:53:08.956 --> 00:53:09.817]  I want to play a few of these.
[00:53:11.476 --> 00:53:15.760]  We're going to play a few of these news reports of what's happening in Hardin, and then we'll be right back.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.882]  Stay with us after this quick break.
[00:53:17.902 --> 00:53:27.030]  Some of the history of it, the would-be FEMA camp with weird paramilitary forces patrolling around at it, and then we will continue.
[00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:27.911]  Here we go.
[00:53:32.318 --> 00:53:34.039]  This could be Gitmo West.
[00:53:34.459 --> 00:53:38.281]  Right now, it's a prison with no prisoners in tiny Hardin, Montana.
[00:53:38.821 --> 00:53:42.283]  City officials want to fill it with detainees from Guantanamo Bay.
[00:53:42.643 --> 00:53:46.785]  Terrorists, like self-proclaimed 9-11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[00:53:46.885 --> 00:53:47.805]  It would bring jobs.
[00:53:48.786 --> 00:53:51.407]  Believe it or not, it would even bring hope and opportunity.
[00:53:52.486 --> 00:53:57.972]  This is the poorest county in Montana, and the $27 million prison has turned into a white elephant.
[00:53:58.392 --> 00:54:00.754]  But not everyone wants detainees here.
[00:54:01.115 --> 00:54:02.356]  I would move out of Hardin.
[00:54:02.636 --> 00:54:04.218]  My son is in the military.
[00:54:04.298 --> 00:54:06.120]  He came back from Afghanistan.
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:10.845]  He says that people have no respect for any human life, even their own.
[00:54:11.425 --> 00:54:13.927]  They are some of the most dangerous people in the world.
[00:54:14.267 --> 00:54:22.874]  And some in the community worry that if they were here in this medium security prison, they would attract other radicals to the area, or even worse, escape.
[00:54:23.054 --> 00:54:27.817]  The person that wants to make it an issue, we'd be happy to lock them up and see how long it takes them to come out.
[00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:31.340]  And then, if they can, I'll buy them coffee at the coffee shop.
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:32.741]  Not a problem.
[00:54:32.981 --> 00:54:38.105]  There are plenty of cameras, and wiring for more, and row upon row of razor wire.
[00:54:38.424 --> 00:54:39.985]  They're even ready for trouble here.
[00:54:40.045 --> 00:54:43.686]  They've got gas masks and riot helmets, shields, batons.
[00:54:44.027 --> 00:54:46.007]  They even have guns.
[00:54:46.868 --> 00:54:50.810]  There's also open land around the prison that would make a getaway difficult.
[00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:57.052]  Because there are no prisoners, Glenn and Ray Perkins got laid off after moving to Hardin to take guard jobs.
[00:54:57.512 --> 00:55:00.154]  They've worked at maximum security prisons in Texas.
[00:55:00.454 --> 00:55:02.155]  Everything in this one is state-of-the-art.
[00:55:04.115 --> 00:55:07.357]  It's the most secure place I've ever worked in.
[00:55:07.873 --> 00:55:10.193]  Even more secure than those maximum security facilities?
[00:55:10.213 --> 00:55:10.593]  Absolutely, yeah.
[00:55:11.454 --> 00:55:16.334]  But they oppose moving detainees here, even though it might mean getting their jobs back.
[00:55:16.835 --> 00:55:21.555]  Bottom line, I just want the facility to open, but no, I don't really want Kimbo in my backyard.
[00:55:22.115 --> 00:55:23.796]  Montana's senators agree.
[00:55:24.876 --> 00:55:29.357]  I don't think they know what they're asking for when they're asking to take these prisoners on.
[00:55:29.697 --> 00:55:37.058]  But President Obama wants to close Guantanamo in January, and if that happens, the detainees will have to go somewhere.
[00:55:37.682 --> 00:55:44.008]  Coming into a community that really wants them is going to be a lot easier than going into one that doesn't.
[00:55:44.788 --> 00:55:49.713]  And this may be the only city in the country that's ready, willing, and able to take them.
[00:55:51.074 --> 00:55:53.196]  Jean Meserve, CNN, Hardin, Montana.
[00:55:57.319 --> 00:56:04.906]  From Nazareth he came with a full ragtag band
[00:56:08.715 --> 00:56:09.596]  We're good to go.
[00:56:45.121 --> 00:56:48.465]  We're good to go.
[00:57:01.445 --> 00:57:04.047]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:57:04.467 --> 00:57:09.431]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:57:09.792 --> 00:57:11.533]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:57:11.833 --> 00:57:16.657]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:57:16.837 --> 00:57:17.798]  How much do you want?
[00:57:18.018 --> 00:57:18.779]  When do you want it?
[00:57:19.159 --> 00:57:20.740]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:21.861]  When will you need it?
[00:57:22.121 --> 00:57:24.183]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:57:24.323 --> 00:57:25.424]  Will there be any food?
[00:57:25.664 --> 00:57:26.965]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:57:27.165 --> 00:57:32.228]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:57:32.429 --> 00:57:35.611]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:57:36.011 --> 00:57:39.513]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:57:39.834 --> 00:57:40.834]  How much will you need?
[00:57:41.074 --> 00:57:41.675]  We don't know.
[00:57:41.975 --> 00:57:42.876]  How much do you want?
[00:57:43.076 --> 00:57:43.796]  All you can get.
[00:57:44.016 --> 00:57:44.817]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:45.097 --> 00:57:47.861]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:58:00.646 --> 00:58:05.813]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:05.953 --> 00:58:10.319]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:58:10.479 --> 00:58:12.342]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:58:12.762 --> 00:58:14.124]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:58:14.384 --> 00:58:15.446]  There is a solution.

[00:59:01.536 --> 00:59:06.318]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[00:59:06.698 --> 00:59:09.839]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[00:59:10.199 --> 00:59:15.641]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[00:59:15.901 --> 00:59:18.362]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[00:59:18.462 --> 00:59:22.523]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[00:59:23.023 --> 00:59:25.744]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[00:59:26.184 --> 00:59:31.629]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[00:59:31.909 --> 00:59:33.831]  That's NoGerms.info.
[00:59:34.171 --> 00:59:42.478]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[00:59:42.738 --> 00:59:43.739]  Don't pick your nose.
[00:59:44.099 --> 00:59:48.383]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[00:59:48.683 --> 00:59:53.588]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.

[00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:57.251]  That's no germs dot info.
[00:59:57.751 --> 00:59:59.253]  Be well and stay well.
[00:59:59.493 --> 01:00:00.214]  Best MZ.
[01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:06.571]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.252 --> 01:00:08.292]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.013 --> 01:00:10.113]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:11.594]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.355 --> 01:00:13.235]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.936 --> 01:00:17.538]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.098 --> 01:00:22.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.341 --> 01:00:28.784]  Alright, Michael Hollingsworth has done a really good journalistic job.
[01:00:28.804 --> 01:00:31.546]  We have a story posted up at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:34.607]  Hardin, Montana under siege is the headline.
[01:00:35.987 --> 01:00:41.771]  What we know is this American police force is a foreign mercenary company.
[01:00:41.851 --> 01:00:43.552]  I've got local newscast with...
[01:00:44.551 --> 01:00:49.914]  Legislators at the State House saying, yeah, they won't say who they are, where the money came from.
[01:00:50.515 --> 01:00:55.818]  They've done weird court battles to overturn Montana law to get the $27 million facility.
[01:00:55.838 --> 01:00:58.880]  They announced they're going to bring in foreign troops to train there.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.801]  I mean, we've got scores.
[01:01:00.981 --> 01:01:04.063]  I know it's more than 15 different newscasts we've posted.
[01:01:04.444 --> 01:01:10.588]  CNN, Billings News, local news, saying everything that's basically in Michael Hollingsworth's article.
[01:01:11.488 --> 01:01:21.996]  I did read in the Billings Gazette and other newspapers in California, not just Montana, that this Billings Gazette writer has gone to work for them all of a sudden.
[01:01:23.577 --> 01:01:25.479]  Lots of bizarre stuff going on there.
[01:01:26.019 --> 01:01:30.022]  You've got this weird foreigner who runs it all going around.
[01:01:30.763 --> 01:01:38.649]  They've got foreign commanders who are on the news, and they say it's all secret, we're not telling you, but then we have earlier news till the people said no from
[01:01:39.804 --> 01:01:42.826]  April, where they said it was going to be Guantanamo West.
[01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.626]  We have CNN and local news.
[01:01:45.047 --> 01:01:48.608]  But as soon as the public said, first they made the public pay for this with a bomb proposal.
[01:01:50.169 --> 01:01:52.470]  And then it sat there empty for the last year and a half.
[01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:53.671]  It's a giant facility.
[01:01:54.171 --> 01:02:00.674]  This American police force put their decals on SUVs, saying they were the local hardened police force.
[01:02:00.714 --> 01:02:01.915]  This is all confirmed.
[01:02:03.123 --> 01:02:07.704]  But Michael Hollingsworth has been interviewing the locals, talking to them.
[01:02:07.765 --> 01:02:08.985]  He knows who all of them are.
[01:02:09.005 --> 01:02:12.286]  We're going to be reporting with him in the next few days here on air.
[01:02:12.306 --> 01:02:17.888]  I will let you know that by Friday, at least, we're going to have reporters on the ground there.
[01:02:18.728 --> 01:02:19.848]  Imagine who may be there.
[01:02:19.868 --> 01:02:22.489]  I'm just going to leave that open for imagination.
[01:02:26.348 --> 01:02:27.669]  Oh, I'm sure I've already hinted enough.
[01:02:28.449 --> 01:02:29.610]  I'm going to be there tomorrow, folks.
[01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:31.191]  I always tell the enemy when I'm coming.
[01:02:31.652 --> 01:02:40.037]  So the point is, is that I like to give my heads up going there to do this, because then they'll overreact and show who they really are, too.
[01:02:40.077 --> 01:02:42.399]  So the point is, I want them to know I'm coming.
[01:02:44.921 --> 01:02:47.743]  Anyways, I'm not going to let people know exactly what, but tune in tomorrow.
[01:02:48.603 --> 01:02:51.065]  Let's go to Michael Hollingsworth.
[01:02:51.105 --> 01:02:55.428]  Michael, tell us briefly about yourself and then in a snapshot what's really going on there.
[01:02:56.325 --> 01:02:57.546]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:02:57.566 --> 01:03:00.408]  I wanted to open by saying it's both an honor and a privilege to be with you today.
[01:03:00.429 --> 01:03:01.690]  Well, it's nice to talk to you.
[01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:17.143]  I represent a patriotically-based website called Freedom Video USA that represents a vast number of American patriots who are all military veterans, law enforcement veterans, concerned citizens, people that have not been blinded by the current presidential administration's smoke and mirrors.
[01:03:18.103 --> 01:03:25.929]  We were able to see right through it, and we absolutely have a 100% policy for dispelling all of the bovine fertilizer that's being spread from corner to corner in this country.
[01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:34.656]  I got some emails from some very good friends of mine who are just as dedicated to truth as I am, and said, hey man, this is up in your neck of the woods, what's going on up there?
[01:03:35.317 --> 01:03:37.138]  And I looked into it, and I was like, APF?
[01:03:37.238 --> 01:03:38.879]  I'm like, what does that even mean?
[01:03:38.919 --> 01:03:43.983]  I said, police forces are hired by the local jurisdictions that they work for.
[01:03:44.103 --> 01:03:46.105]  There's no such thing as a national police force.
[01:03:46.775 --> 01:03:48.116]  But a little bit of background on me.
[01:03:48.176 --> 01:03:50.317]  I'm eight years in the service in two branches of the U.S.
[01:03:50.357 --> 01:03:50.777]  military.
[01:03:50.797 --> 01:03:55.499]  I've worked in the private sector a little bit, worked for a small-time government contractor, done a lot of civil service work.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:05.604]  All of the men in my family are veterans, have been American patriots, and that's what we classify as our number one line of employment as an American patriot, preserver of the representative republic in which we live.
[01:04:05.624 --> 01:04:08.125]  Good, so you're up there, you live nearby, you went and checked it out.
[01:04:08.225 --> 01:04:09.666]  Give us your take on it.
[01:04:10.339 --> 01:04:18.847]  Well, the bottom line started off with an hour-and-a-half long conversation with a lady by the name of Becky Shea, who is a almost 20-year reporter with the Billings Gazette.
[01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:23.392]  And she was the one who broke the story initially, so I contacted her.
[01:04:23.452 --> 01:04:29.578]  She is now currently the public affairs liaison for American Police Force, and I spoke with her.
[01:04:30.396 --> 01:04:35.320]  I had a very interesting conversation where it felt like she was trying to sell me something and I said, you know, well, how did this happen?
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.664]  How did you go from being the reporter that broke this story to being, you know, the mouthpiece of the beast here kind of thing?
[01:04:41.304 --> 01:04:47.649]  And I said, all of the people, all the things that I'm reading, all the feedback I'm getting from the people of heart and say that they're not interested in having hell, they weren't even notified.
[01:04:47.669 --> 01:04:48.970]  These people just came out of nowhere.
[01:04:49.633 --> 01:04:49.853]  I think so.
[01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:09.726]  Well, I mean, she's quoted in other newspapers making similar statements.
[01:05:10.246 --> 01:05:14.991]  It seems like she's so starstruck by the money, she's even wanting to talk to us.
[01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:19.675]  And then meanwhile, you've got guys with foreign accents going, we will tell you nothing.
[01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:21.557]  We are bringing in foreign forces.
[01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:26.742]  I mean, this is, I mean, in these newscasts, it's like they're trying to freak everybody out.
[01:05:27.402 --> 01:05:30.445]  And it's just classic intelligence operation.
[01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:33.448]  They admit they're looking at it for the Guantanamo Bay.
[01:05:33.849 --> 01:05:42.598]  They have another former Supermax, and I need to print that off before we leave, because I saw it in the news and I haven't Googled it yet, but there's another Supermax in Montana.
[01:05:42.738 --> 01:05:43.639]  This is a Supermax.
[01:05:44.059 --> 01:05:52.843]  Where they quote have animal rights activists and US terrorists and I saw civil rights suits filed because they don't let them see their families even once a month for visitation.
[01:05:53.123 --> 01:05:54.784]  So clearly Montana is the place.
[01:05:55.144 --> 01:05:59.766]  Clearly this is being looked at as where they want to move these assets in and then
[01:06:00.626 --> 01:06:18.945]  It's just red flags are shooting up, then they show up in black SUVs saying they're the hardened police, then they have the head of this Twin River Authority that's kind of taking over, that's leased it to them, saying, oh yes, well it is our wish list for them to be the police.
[01:06:19.286 --> 01:06:21.028]  I mean, am I entering the twilight zone?
[01:06:21.869 --> 01:06:23.110]  No sir, you're 100% correct.
[01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:28.053]  I spoke with Al Peterson, the Executive Director of Twin Rivers Authority yesterday, very briefly.
[01:06:28.173 --> 01:06:30.835]  I got him on the phone and I asked him to confirm or deny these rumors.
[01:06:31.495 --> 01:06:38.460]  And I said, you know, this is a facility that was denied operational status because it was not built in specification to Montana Code.
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:46.785]  In order to house prisoners legally in the state of Montana, you have to have X amount of square feet per prisoner in order for it to be considered humane incarceration.
[01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:47.425]  I think so.
[01:07:01.952 --> 01:07:07.473]  You know, so this is all really, you're saying red flags that started popping up to us going, okay, was this facility built specifically with the intention?
[01:07:07.513 --> 01:07:09.274]  Is this how far back this plan goes?
[01:07:09.774 --> 01:07:14.155]  Is that they already were building these facilities because they knew there was no way their estate was ever going to allow to house them.
[01:07:14.575 --> 01:07:21.176]  So yesterday I spoke with the Governor Brian Schweitzer's office who assures me that absolutely nothing illegal or unconstitutional is being allowed to happen.
[01:07:21.236 --> 01:07:28.198]  I rebutted with, then why are these people showing up and committing the felony of impersonating a peace officer by having hardened police department written on their vehicles?
[01:07:28.758 --> 01:07:39.001]  Well, sir, that's a private agency dealing with a private town, and that's not under the governor's authority, and it's really not something that we're at liberty to discuss, and we're not at liberty to discuss hypothetical situations.
[01:07:39.081 --> 01:07:41.041]  I said, sir, hypothetical situations.
[01:07:41.081 --> 01:07:41.901]  We have video of it.
[01:07:42.461 --> 01:07:43.142]  We have pictures.
[01:07:43.262 --> 01:07:44.602]  Well, that was the thing.
[01:07:44.682 --> 01:07:48.503]  The California paper said
[01:07:51.363 --> 01:07:57.669]  The San Jose Mercury News said Alex Jones says they've got police on the side of their cars.
[01:07:57.849 --> 01:08:00.051]  No, that's what the local news is saying.
[01:08:01.012 --> 01:08:01.753]  That's a fact.
[01:08:01.793 --> 01:08:02.554]  We've got pictures.
[01:08:02.594 --> 01:08:03.354]  We've got video.
[01:08:03.975 --> 01:08:08.459]  There's interviews with citizens of the city of Hardin that are looking at these vehicles going, who the heck are these people?
[01:08:08.499 --> 01:08:09.580]  We did not hire these people.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.681]  We have no idea who they are.
[01:08:11.122 --> 01:08:16.247]  Let me ask you this since you live nearby, because I've been trying to study this the last three days, last two days.
[01:08:18.325 --> 01:08:29.511]  Am I correct in saying that they had a bond issuance to build a prison to give people jobs, then they did a bait-and-switch and said it's a FEMA camp and an international Merck training center?
[01:08:30.131 --> 01:08:30.491]  Correct.
[01:08:30.511 --> 01:08:38.716]  The bond issue, basically what happened, the bond issue has been in court tied up for several years now because they can't seem to get the paperwork straightened out for it, so they changed their business plan.
[01:08:38.736 --> 01:08:40.597]  And this is something that I approached Becky Shea with.
[01:08:41.318 --> 01:08:45.440]  And I said, exactly who are you planning on training and what are you planning on training them to do?
[01:08:46.147 --> 01:08:53.452]  And she says, well, you know, that's really not something I have the liberty to discuss, but it's going to be something to the nature of police slash detention officer type training.
[01:08:53.512 --> 01:09:00.377]  And I said, man, what's wrong with the Montana Law Enforcement Academy's Peace Officer Standards and Training in our state accredited academy?
[01:09:01.097 --> 01:09:02.458]  You can't function in the state of Montana.
[01:09:02.478 --> 01:09:09.623]  I don't know how it runs in other places, but in the state of Montana, you cannot be a sworn peace officer unless you have graduated the post academy.
[01:09:09.803 --> 01:09:12.585]  You have to take the Montana state approved post academy
[01:09:13.334 --> 01:09:15.775]  And the counties and cities are chartered under the state.
[01:09:15.815 --> 01:09:17.755]  That's their only authorities to the legislature.
[01:09:18.375 --> 01:09:18.696]  Correct.
[01:09:18.736 --> 01:09:19.856]  That is precisely correct.
[01:09:20.336 --> 01:09:26.258]  So basically, I said, you know, I called the sheriff's office and the gentleman that answered the phone was very abrupt with me and said that I'm not going to speak to you.
[01:09:26.618 --> 01:09:28.318]  If you want to know anything, call the city of Hardin.
[01:09:28.338 --> 01:09:29.338]  So I called the city of Hardin.
[01:09:29.859 --> 01:09:34.860]  They played the, you know, Jimmy Code, Go Tell Bobby, Go Tell Mary game with me and pushed me off to 30 different people.
[01:09:35.629 --> 01:09:42.497]  And anytime that happens, that's basically, in the seven tenets of special operations, you have one of them called UW or unconventional warfare.
[01:09:42.977 --> 01:09:52.688]  And essentially what happens with unconventional warfare is the disinformation campaign, the psychological operations, where you will go in and set, you know, light the fuse, if you will, creating the need
[01:09:52.708 --> 01:09:54.709]  So you set the groundswork of problem, reaction, solution?
[01:09:54.729 --> 01:09:55.129]  Oh, that's key.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:30.245]  I asked her, I said, now, so basically what you guys did is you targeted Hardin, Montana because you realized that its financial infrastructure was collapsing and the city was about to implode and they had no money and they've been taking handouts from the state for X number of years.
[01:10:30.305 --> 01:10:32.286]  And she goes, well, I don't know that targeted was a good word.
[01:10:32.846 --> 01:10:38.609]  But she says, I think it was more that we did a complex financial evaluations of all of the locations.
[01:10:39.747 --> 01:10:51.357]  And it's the poorest county, they're sold this jail will save you, then they bait and switch it and turn it into a command center for American police force to spill out as society implodes.
[01:10:51.617 --> 01:10:52.618]  The Mercs are here!
[01:10:53.239 --> 01:10:53.739]  Precisely.
[01:10:53.779 --> 01:11:00.805]  Now you'll notice very carefully if you go to their website you will see an emblazoned logo on their berets and the side of their vehicle that has a two-headed eagle.
[01:11:00.845 --> 01:11:02.767]  That is the Serbian royal family crest.
[01:11:05.065 --> 01:11:08.587]  So basically, this Michael Hilton guy refers to himself as Captain Michael Hilton.
[01:11:08.607 --> 01:11:13.050]  He stands about 5'1", maybe 150 pounds soaking wet.
[01:11:14.331 --> 01:11:18.013]  This gentleman has got a very not-so-personal attitude about it.
[01:11:18.033 --> 01:11:18.573]  And I asked Ms.
[01:11:18.613 --> 01:11:25.858]  Shea in our conversation, I said, you know, don't you think it's rather deceptive to play all these, I'm not going to tell you where our funding comes from, I'm not going to tell you who our parent company is.
[01:11:25.918 --> 01:11:28.179]  I said, you know, all this cloak and dagger and smoke and mirrors.
[01:11:28.239 --> 01:11:30.140]  I said, how do you expect the people of Hardin to trust you?
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:31.401]  And she says, well, they really don't have to.
[01:11:32.113 --> 01:11:34.574]  Because it's basically already cut and dried with their city council.
[01:11:35.094 --> 01:11:36.354]  Incredibly arrogant.
[01:11:36.374 --> 01:11:37.855]  Yeah, they went and bought the council.
[01:11:38.415 --> 01:11:38.835]  Stay there.
[01:11:38.915 --> 01:11:39.555]  Final segment.
[01:11:39.575 --> 01:11:42.516]  We've got another interview coming up, but I'm very impressed with your analysis.
[01:11:43.536 --> 01:11:47.797]  Come back with us on the other side, and I definitely want to hook up with you in Montana.
[01:11:47.817 --> 01:11:50.438]  And we're going to be getting into Montana tomorrow.
[01:11:50.918 --> 01:11:52.418]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[01:11:52.818 --> 01:11:53.579]  We'll be right back.
[01:11:53.619 --> 01:11:54.359]  This is important.
[01:11:54.539 --> 01:11:57.500]  A real-life FEMA camp run by foreign spooks.
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:58.440]  And we're on it.
[01:12:01.007 --> 01:12:07.850]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:10.531]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:12:10.811 --> 01:12:15.273]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[01:12:15.453 --> 01:12:19.855]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[01:12:19.955 --> 01:12:21.876]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[01:12:22.036 --> 01:12:24.417]  At Graf Undersafes, security is their sole purpose.
[01:12:24.597 --> 01:12:28.878]  Go to graphundersafes.com today to see their entire line of amazing products available.
[01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:31.139]  Or call 866-457-1801.
[01:12:31.279 --> 01:12:35.460]  Graph Undersafes are fire and burglary resistant and have a lifetime warranty.
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:41.402]  They have established an unequal reputation of quality for supplying their safes and vault doors to residential customers.
[01:12:41.622 --> 01:12:41.822]  You bet!
[01:13:02.731 --> 01:13:03.772]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:13:04.173 --> 01:13:09.659]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:10.720]  That's right.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.323]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:13:13.663 --> 01:13:20.831]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:13:21.371 --> 01:13:29.058]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:13:29.498 --> 01:13:34.382]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:13:35.003 --> 01:13:39.987]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:40.807 --> 01:13:44.911]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:13:45.311 --> 01:13:45.572]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:47.494]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:13:47.554 --> 01:13:47.874]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:47.894 --> 01:13:48.435]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:01.597 --> 01:14:09.147]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:14:09.167 --> 01:14:10.769]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:14:10.849 --> 01:14:13.692]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:14:13.752 --> 01:14:17.858]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:14:27.015 --> 01:14:31.950]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:14:33.173 --> 01:14:34.297]  An inside job.
[01:14:35.678 --> 01:14:36.799]  How dare you?
[01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:43.183]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:14:43.203 --> 01:14:45.504]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:14:45.544 --> 01:14:51.508]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of Donald Trump.
[01:14:51.568 --> 01:14:52.288]  Truth Rising.
[01:14:52.568 --> 01:14:55.130]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:57.411]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:14:57.671 --> 01:15:00.153]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:15:02.228 --> 01:15:03.429]  Remain in your houses.
[01:15:03.469 --> 01:15:09.392]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[01:15:10.012 --> 01:15:10.993]  Will they do it?
[01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:13.334]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[01:15:13.975 --> 01:15:20.018]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[01:15:20.458 --> 01:15:21.699]  Think it can't happen here?
[01:15:22.639 --> 01:15:26.161]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:31.203]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[01:15:31.803 --> 01:15:36.065]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[01:15:36.705 --> 01:15:41.527]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[01:15:42.447 --> 01:15:50.573]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:15:50.873 --> 01:15:53.155]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:15:53.375 --> 01:15:56.257]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[01:15:56.437 --> 01:15:59.339]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[01:16:03.715 --> 01:16:05.616]  There's so many red flags in this.
[01:16:05.636 --> 01:16:09.397]  We're going to be covering it over the next two days, along with all the latest flu developments here on air.
[01:16:09.457 --> 01:16:10.557]  Burmess will be sitting in live.
[01:16:10.597 --> 01:16:12.718]  I'll be doing live reports from Montana.
[01:16:14.978 --> 01:16:22.421]  But, then you have the lady running for mayor, whose husband was the head of the facility, who's now been removed.
[01:16:23.001 --> 01:16:25.382]  I mean, this just gets crazier and crazier, sir.
[01:16:28.362 --> 01:16:29.002]  Yeah, sure does.
[01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:34.345]  This Smith gentleman was the Executive Director of Twin Rivers, Two Rivers Authority.
[01:16:35.986 --> 01:16:44.610]  They say that he was put on administrative leave without so much as an explanation, and I've tried on all of the three numbers I've been able to obtain, I get nothing but voicemail.
[01:16:45.431 --> 01:16:49.593]  Kerry Smith, who is his wife, who is the current mayoral candidate,
[01:16:49.993 --> 01:16:51.875]  Yeah, that's her on the TV news.
[01:16:51.955 --> 01:16:53.837]  And the State House is saying, we're not getting answers.
[01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:19.900]  Yeah, well, that's the thing is, you know, this last two days that I've spent literally, uh, several, you know, most of this last two days on the phone with the Montana government, I'm getting all these canned answers, uh, from Governor Schweitzer, from Senator Baucus, and it's all the same thing.
[01:17:19.921 --> 01:17:22.323]  Well, sir, we're very honored that you took the time to contact us today.
[01:17:22.343 --> 01:17:25.426]  We'll be glad to send you a rubber-stamped form letter and blah, blah, blah.
[01:17:25.446 --> 01:17:27.628]  No, we're actually not really at liberty to talk about that.
[01:17:27.648 --> 01:17:30.871]  The biggest, scariest, and most disgusting thing about this, Mr. Jones,
[01:17:31.471 --> 01:17:32.271]  We're good to go.
[01:17:47.392 --> 01:17:52.433]  Has absolutely no interest in the fact that there are foreign mercenaries who have set up a forward operating base, essentially.
[01:17:52.453 --> 01:17:56.994]  It's a hardened structure that is surrounded by... There's an abdication of authority.
[01:17:57.274 --> 01:17:58.854]  They're just saying, do whatever you want.
[01:17:59.735 --> 01:18:03.455]  And then you said this commander, he calls himself some type of commander.
[01:18:03.655 --> 01:18:07.816]  He's like... Captain Michael Heston or something like that.
[01:18:07.876 --> 01:18:11.137]  And you're saying he gets really mad when you try to talk to him?
[01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:20.255]  Well, you know, I haven't had the ability to personally talk to him, but what I have seen in the interviews is that he's very short, he's very brief and very matter-of-factly with the media representatives that have spoken with him.
[01:18:20.976 --> 01:18:25.500]  I've reached out... Who is the old guy with the foreign accent, always smoking cigarettes with everyone?
[01:18:25.521 --> 01:18:27.242]  The town officials are always groveling.
[01:18:27.442 --> 01:18:28.383]  Their body language is...
[01:18:29.364 --> 01:18:30.204]  Okay, that's him.
[01:18:30.545 --> 01:18:39.809]  And then the tall, heavy set gentleman with gray hair is Al Peterson, who is the Executive Director of Two Rivers Authority.
[01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:44.210]  He physically cursed me out over the phone, told me I was way out in left field, was full of...
[01:18:45.831 --> 01:18:48.613]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[01:18:48.633 --> 01:18:49.113]  Where is this going?
[01:18:49.133 --> 01:18:50.634]  Because they may think that they own the town.
[01:18:50.654 --> 01:18:53.055]  I mean, this is like something out of an old western.
[01:18:53.175 --> 01:18:53.976]  I mean, how is this going to end?
[01:18:53.996 --> 01:18:55.156]  Just black SUVs riding around, ruling us?
[01:19:15.609 --> 01:19:22.433]  Well, you know, that's our summarization at this point is that, you know, we've been observing these conditions as they magnify magnetomically on a daily basis.
[01:19:22.894 --> 01:19:25.676]  You know, everything that Obama has told us has been a bald-faced lie.
[01:19:25.716 --> 01:19:38.304]  He said, and now this is imperative, he very clearly said in one of his addresses to the nation, quote, we need a private military force, a private police force that is just as well equipped and trained as our modern military.
[01:19:38.344 --> 01:19:40.025]  Just as big, just as strong.
[01:19:40.445 --> 01:19:42.166]  Just as big, just as strong.
[01:19:42.507 --> 01:19:43.447]  Well, by God, here they are.
[01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:44.048]  They're called APF.
[01:19:45.336 --> 01:19:46.057]  Here they are, Merck.
[01:19:46.177 --> 01:19:52.162]  And she told you, their spokeswoman, the former Billings Gazette reporter, now admittedly works, she said, oh this is nationwide.
[01:19:53.123 --> 01:20:01.890]  She, in no uncertain terms, she was very evasive about it, but she slipped on a couple of occasions and said that they had, this is how they had done the evaluations for centers from coast to coast.
[01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:04.653]  That they had several other states that were looking at doing the same thing.
[01:20:05.816 --> 01:20:10.581]  And then they won't say where their money comes from, but predominantly they're corporate.
[01:20:10.621 --> 01:20:13.123]  Oh, and on the news they say hundreds.
[01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:14.985]  One newscast said 500.
[01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:15.926]  One said more.
[01:20:16.307 --> 01:20:19.530]  Personnel are about to arrive, but no one can be told anything about them.
[01:20:20.267 --> 01:20:20.507]  I'm good.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.300]  A battalion?
[01:20:43.401 --> 01:20:45.402]  That's an awful lot of Special Forces Qualified Troops.
[01:20:45.862 --> 01:21:03.533]  But, you know, the other thing that we're kind of leery about this whole thing is that, you know, when I directly approached her and I said, so what about these potential ties that we've discovered through our research on the internet that say that you were tied to corporations like Dynacor, like, you know, Three Canopies, or Dynacor Blackwater Security, now known as XE.
[01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:09.077]  And she says, well, I'm not really at liberty to discuss any of this.
[01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:12.700]  So this group may just be a cutout for a consortium of mercs.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:16.202]  You know, basically what it is, is this is the smoke screen.
[01:21:16.622 --> 01:21:22.307]  When you go to penetrate your enemy's defensive lines, what you're going to do is probe their defenses first to find out where their strong points are.
[01:21:22.687 --> 01:21:29.852]  And you do that by creating extremely sensitive and extremely visible pockets of, you know, little things that you can see.
[01:21:30.173 --> 01:21:31.954]  From that point, you exploit the weaknesses
[01:21:32.114 --> 01:21:38.036]  Well yeah, we're getting calls about black SUVs, Humvees, troop movements all over that area.
[01:21:38.376 --> 01:21:42.998]  We're going to get more updates from you in the days to come when I'm on the ground in Montana.
[01:21:43.058 --> 01:21:45.559]  Mr. Hollingsworth, your reports at InfoWars.com.
[01:21:45.879 --> 01:21:46.980]  Thanks for your great info.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:48.160]  Oh yeah, Alex.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.161]  Thank you for everything you do.
[01:21:51.021 --> 01:21:51.902]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.402 --> 01:21:54.002]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:57.604]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.572 --> 01:22:04.534]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:22:04.794 --> 01:22:06.575]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:22:06.815 --> 01:22:15.079]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:22:15.319 --> 01:22:20.541]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:22:20.881 --> 01:22:22.502]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:22:22.742 --> 01:22:29.067]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:22:29.247 --> 01:22:40.016]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:22:40.317 --> 01:22:40.817]  That's right.
[01:22:41.077 --> 01:22:43.399]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:22:43.639 --> 01:22:45.241]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:22:47.562 --> 01:23:02.655]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:23:02.975 --> 01:23:06.398]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:23:06.578 --> 01:23:08.459]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:23:08.479 --> 01:23:11.822]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:23:12.122 --> 01:23:14.044]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[01:23:15.353 --> 01:23:15.653]  We're good.
[01:23:34.673 --> 01:23:37.335]  Directly to your computer or iPhone and share it with others.
[01:23:37.715 --> 01:23:43.579]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:48.282]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
