[00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:16.997]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:26.061]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:28.402]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:00:37.807 --> 00:00:39.568]  Perhaps you had better stop from the beginning.
[00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:45.814]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[00:00:46.074 --> 00:00:48.256]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:50.878]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[00:00:53.047 --> 00:00:59.011]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:06.175]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:11.258]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:14.160]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.402]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:21.464]  We have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:26.673]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:27.573]  Well, join me.
[00:01:28.114 --> 00:01:30.215]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:32.316]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:01:33.857 --> 00:01:40.340]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.859]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:52.860]  We are live.
[00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:54.883]  Friday, the ninth day.
[00:01:56.565 --> 00:02:07.748]  Of January 2009, we are the good ship humanity, steaming straight in to the New World Order super typhoon that intends to sink us.
[00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:12.809]  I see the gullible, poisoned, hypnotized public.
[00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:20.791]  They're like little children, so trusting, having no idea the grid that is being built and tightened around their little throats.
[00:02:21.932 --> 00:02:26.076]  But, as history has shown, the public is generally outplaying foolishly.
[00:02:26.876 --> 00:02:37.405]  And it is up to the good men and women of honor, of decency, who love humanity, and who understand the danger of corruption and wickedness, to stand up and fight.
[00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:40.408]  And if we take the field, they will fail.
[00:02:40.468 --> 00:02:42.229]  The New World Order will fall.
[00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.490]  We don't have a choice.
[00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:44.932]  They're giving us no quarter.
[00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.542]  CuttingToTheMatrix.com is our guest website.
[00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:49.683]  CuttingToTheMatrix.com.
[00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:53.266]  My websites of course are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.528]  And he joins us every few weeks.
[00:02:54.548 --> 00:02:57.190]  We're always honored to have him join us from Canada.
[00:02:57.671 --> 00:02:58.892]  He is Alan Watt.
[00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:01.434]  He's with us for the next hour and 50 minutes.
[00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:03.837]  Alan Watt, we didn't do any pre-interview.
[00:03:04.257 --> 00:03:08.341]  Whatever you want to get into today, I'd love to break it down, any of the latest news developments.
[00:03:09.282 --> 00:03:11.723]  The establishment is accelerating their announcement.
[00:03:11.803 --> 00:03:15.064]  They are setting up a world bank to be the world government.
[00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:20.806]  They are admitting just so much of their agenda right now out of the gates.
[00:03:20.986 --> 00:03:32.951]  Why is the establishment, after denying all this for all these decades, now emerging and admitting that they indeed are setting up a tyrannical world government, but for our own good, in quotes?
[00:03:34.324 --> 00:03:39.227]  I think, to be honest with you, that they're so sure of themselves now they have the whole thing in the bag.
[00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:43.189]  They do control all of society.
[00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:51.913]  The cultures of every country in the world now are interdependent, the same as the economy, as the cultures are as well.
[00:03:52.234 --> 00:03:57.596]  It all comes from Hollywood and television, the same newscasters, etc., worldwide.
[00:03:58.157 --> 00:04:00.198]  And so they're pretty sure of themselves, plus
[00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:10.884]  They have all of academia worldwide sewn up on board with this agenda and they do know and have written about this in the past that it was essential
[00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:18.261]  To get academia on their side because they become the future leaders, bureaucrats, CEOs of corporations and so on.
[00:04:18.662 --> 00:04:30.408]  So when they're all trained in the same tunnel vision of this world order, they think that the people, they call them the pros, as Orwell called them too, the pros are not even relevant.
[00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:32.389]  The masses don't even know what's happening.
[00:04:33.049 --> 00:04:34.830]  And most of them, to be honest with you, don't really care.
[00:04:36.137 --> 00:04:38.100]  So this has always been their standard philosophy.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:48.938]  We saw them when they set up the communist system as a dialectic to help bring all this about, that communism was spread from the universities, from professors downwards.
[00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.041]  And that became the prevalent culture within society in the Western Hemisphere.
[00:04:54.061 --> 00:05:09.029]  Now they're bringing the both together, but they truly do have all the basic academic sciences on board with all of this agenda, including eugenics, including the necessity to depopulate drastically, rapidly.
[00:05:09.694 --> 00:05:15.899]  And also to get rid of what they see now as the useless eaters that would be left over from a previous society.
[00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:23.345]  They're going into the new world order with the new man and a much reduced society of what they think are the better gene types.
[00:05:24.206 --> 00:05:32.593]  The old man now, according to the Darwinian principle, which they're all grounded on, is now obsolete and cannot be brought through into the new system.
[00:05:34.727 --> 00:05:41.730]  Now, to be specific, we're not even debating whether there's evolution or whether that theory had some basis in reality.
[00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.710]  We're not debating that either or.
[00:05:44.170 --> 00:06:02.277]  The fact is, that's their governing system through social Darwinism and eugenics, and so that's their rationale for all the horrors that they carry out, when in reality, from studying the elites, inner bread, we know, causes a lot of psychotic behavior, delusions of grandeur, a lot of other behaviors.
[00:06:02.717 --> 00:06:19.248]  So really we have a aberrant strain of malfunctioning humanity who are very intelligent and well organized, but also psychopathic sociopaths and a gaggle of fellow travelers who only have certain pieces of the puzzle.
[00:06:19.668 --> 00:06:27.654]  And then you have all these subgroups that believe they're at the highest echelons of power when they're really in lower echelons of the pyramidal power structure who revel
[00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:29.635]  Excuse me.
[00:06:30.476 --> 00:06:46.450]  In the raw exercise of mindless power, and that's why when you talk to these mid-level elitist and technicians and university professors that say they want to kill the majority of the public, they're that very infantile and aren't very intelligent.
[00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.432]  But if you talk to one of the higher-level globalists, they are intelligent.
[00:06:49.452 --> 00:07:01.858]  Can you go through that and the way this is broken down from your research in different subgroup directives and the type of mindset of these petty power people who believe that they're members of the elite?
[00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.581]  Yes, there's a book out there people should try and get a hold of.
[00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:12.604]  It's called Political Ponerology and it's about the study of evil in mankind.
[00:07:13.294 --> 00:07:19.839]  Something that was studied in ancient times, but not so much today, because they don't believe in evil or the outcomes of evil.
[00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:22.081]  There's always someone that benefits, therefore it's okay.
[00:07:22.502 --> 00:07:26.865]  That's basically the Kabbalistic form of it, which they're all on board with too.
[00:07:27.706 --> 00:07:38.155]  But Ponderology, this book, goes into psychopathy and how the elite and all nations, all peoples, are basically psychopathic.
[00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:42.198]  They rise to the top in every society because they're ruthless.
[00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:44.934]  They have no conscience whatsoever.
[00:07:45.455 --> 00:07:46.276]  They're very cunning.
[00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:47.517]  They have certain traits.
[00:07:47.557 --> 00:07:56.167]  A psychopath will feel no emotion for other people outside his own little circle or what he owns or he sees as that which he owns.
[00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:58.770]  But he's very good at it.
[00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:03.876]  He's like a camera who studies other people as he grows up, watching how they behave and interact.
[00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:13.501]  And they become tremendous salesmen, they become politicians, they do gravitate towards positions of power, but they're also sadomasochistic in their makeup.
[00:08:14.142 --> 00:08:29.806]  This came out at the Nuremberg trial, where studies were done on the followers, the higher followers of Hitler, and they glorified Hitler to the very end, and yet they despised the weaker officers beneath them.
[00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.850]  So that is sadomasochism.
[00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:44.193]  You will worship the person with more power than you have yourself, and you'll do his bidding immediately with no questions concerned, and you will despise the lessors beneath you.
[00:08:44.253 --> 00:08:49.514]  That is sadomasochistic, and that's a standard part of this whole system in which we live.
[00:08:49.934 --> 00:08:55.035]  In other words, since the creation of commerce and money
[00:08:55.811 --> 00:09:04.714]  And the debt system and banking and so on, and the armies that can finance, take over other countries, seize their assets, resources, and so on.
[00:09:05.174 --> 00:09:10.036]  We've always had the same types gravitating to the top in all societies.
[00:09:10.356 --> 00:09:24.541]  In fact, history is just the stories, his stories basically, that's what history is, of the ruling elites who gain power by being ruthless and merciless towards other people or rivals.
[00:09:25.154 --> 00:09:28.597]  And we have them today in an organized system.
[00:09:28.617 --> 00:09:29.397]  This is the problem.
[00:09:30.298 --> 00:09:35.642]  Now, all many subcultures, you might see nations in fact, have their top gang at the top.
[00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:40.225]  Whoever is at the top of the tree in Japan, China, wherever, is a gang.
[00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:45.549]  It's basically a gang with the most power and they're all psychopathic in their origins.
[00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:47.931]  Today we have an international
[00:09:48.593 --> 00:09:49.253]  I don't think so.
[00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:23.921]  And therefore they have concluded that they are the fittest and they've proven their worth by gaining power, holding on to it intergenerationally, marrying the right types.
[00:10:25.132 --> 00:10:29.315]  Because the wives are selected for them in these groups and have been for hundreds of years.
[00:10:29.555 --> 00:10:47.932]  And Alan, we have, just to add a point going back, I was backing you up, you see it in the press, you see it in sociology reports, that in Washington DC, in New York, in London, that the most popular places for sadomasochism and what all of the elitists, whenever they get caught in a sting or
[00:10:48.332 --> 00:10:48.412]  Yes.
[00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:26.295]  Innocent, would you say in these interlocking, when we come back, I want to go through, from your study, the different gangs we have, that at the next to the highest level of the pyramid is the scientific gang, where whoever's the most cold-blooded is who is admired, and then above that is the elite families?
[00:11:27.136 --> 00:11:27.756]  There's no doubt.
[00:11:27.816 --> 00:11:38.679]  In fact, Huxley himself went through the whole strata of the dominant minority, and the scientific elite, who were especially bred, including his own group, to help this dominant minority.
[00:11:40.694 --> 00:11:42.256]  And then I want to get into the cloning.
[00:11:42.997 --> 00:11:44.539]  The designer baby's already happening.
[00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:46.141]  The cloned cows, the cloned milk.
[00:11:47.042 --> 00:11:49.705]  They're now having to put on milk that it's cloned or it isn't cloned.
[00:11:49.765 --> 00:11:56.994]  I mean, where this Brave New World is going with the amazing guest, Alan Watt, on this Live Friday edition.
[00:11:57.975 --> 00:11:59.297]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:02.611 --> 00:12:08.994]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.335]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:12:12.015 --> 00:12:13.035]  But who is the enemy?
[00:12:13.555 --> 00:12:14.076]  Bin Laden.
[00:12:14.356 --> 00:12:15.276]  This is his M.O.
[00:12:15.316 --> 00:12:16.697]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:18.357]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:12:18.718 --> 00:12:25.460]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.301]  Some U.S.
[00:12:26.341 --> 00:12:31.983]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:12:32.683 --> 00:12:36.225]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:12:36.565 --> 00:12:46.450]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.410]  Fabled enemies.

[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.862]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:13:06.262 --> 00:13:12.227]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:40.746]  I think so.
[00:14:02.472 --> 00:14:03.012]  You worry.
[00:14:03.372 --> 00:14:05.093]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:14:05.433 --> 00:14:07.674]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:14:08.074 --> 00:14:09.874]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:14:10.214 --> 00:14:11.415]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:14:11.815 --> 00:14:15.016]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:14:15.416 --> 00:14:20.277]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:14:20.637 --> 00:14:23.979]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:14:24.619 --> 00:14:25.959]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:28.920]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.141]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:14:32.662 --> 00:14:40.844]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:14:41.304 --> 00:14:45.686]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:14:54.048 --> 00:14:55.508]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:14:55.528 --> 00:14:57.269]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:15:02.432 --> 00:15:04.273]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:15:04.413 --> 00:15:11.095]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:15:11.375 --> 00:15:19.538]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:15:19.758 --> 00:15:25.500]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.462]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:15:27.522 --> 00:15:29.704]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:15:29.824 --> 00:15:34.068]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:15:34.228 --> 00:15:36.350]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:44.337]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:45.117]  We're good to go.
[00:16:14.719 --> 00:16:16.781]  Okay, let's go right back to Alan Wad.
[00:16:20.144 --> 00:16:20.925]  Breaking down.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.561]  Exactly who these elite are.
[00:16:24.601 --> 00:16:27.503]  And again, they've written thousands of books on it, thousands of papers.
[00:16:27.943 --> 00:16:30.104]  And they laugh and say, look at the slave scum.
[00:16:30.945 --> 00:16:34.287]  They can't even read what we're saying we're going to do to them.
[00:16:34.487 --> 00:16:36.989]  And they say that's prima facie evidence.
[00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:42.732]  I've had, as you've, I know, had Alan, elitist, say, Alex, look, you tell them and they don't even listen to you.
[00:16:43.093 --> 00:16:44.414]  See, you need to join us.
[00:16:45.481 --> 00:16:47.283]  And I say, listen, I'm a nurturative person.
[00:16:47.303 --> 00:16:49.504]  I know what I do to others comes back on me.
[00:16:49.524 --> 00:16:50.945]  You know, you people are evil.
[00:16:51.606 --> 00:16:53.007]  And you've helped dumb people down.
[00:16:53.087 --> 00:16:58.131]  You've accelerated the domestication and the institutionalization of the public.
[00:16:58.411 --> 00:17:02.174]  And this is a great crime against life, against our species, against humanity.
[00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:04.857]  And they just snicker.
[00:17:05.977 --> 00:17:09.400]  Or they act sad and go, well, you just don't know the law of nature, do you?
[00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:11.302]  We're just doing something inevitable.
[00:17:11.602 --> 00:17:13.664]  If we didn't act like this, somebody else would.
[00:17:14.938 --> 00:17:15.418]  Alan Watt.
[00:17:16.419 --> 00:17:18.280]  Yeah, that's exactly how they rationalize it.
[00:17:19.081 --> 00:17:28.787]  As I say, through the Darwinian studies of different species and so on, they go down through the sea urchins and all these things, and different groups that came down through the ages.
[00:17:28.807 --> 00:17:31.409]  They've never found missing links, but that's not the point.
[00:17:31.429 --> 00:17:33.550]  The point is, things go extinct.
[00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:37.433]  And we do have evidence of that, different animals go extinct.
[00:17:38.513 --> 00:17:40.935]  So they put man in the same category
[00:17:41.553 --> 00:17:41.833]  Thank you.
[00:17:54.488 --> 00:17:54.648]  I'm
[00:18:12.114 --> 00:18:26.344]  According to the laws of this Darwinian theory, that if the old type come into the new system, they'll overwhelm the elite who have evolved even higher and bring down that high group.
[00:18:26.724 --> 00:18:27.905]  That's what they truly believe.
[00:18:28.245 --> 00:18:31.307]  This is identical to Hinduism.
[00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:39.032]  Hinduism goes through this, and I think that's the connecting link between much of higher Freemasonry
[00:18:39.693 --> 00:18:40.013]  Thank you.
[00:18:58.818 --> 00:19:06.703]  And eventually they get to this advanced type, and they go on into the next wave, how the old type dies off.
[00:19:07.304 --> 00:19:15.129]  It's identical to Darwinism, and you have to ask yourself, did Darwinism come first, or did they simply copy the Hinduistic philosophies?
[00:19:16.443 --> 00:19:19.486]  Or the Babylonian Mysterial Religions is the same thing.
[00:19:20.527 --> 00:19:21.388]  Transhumanist.
[00:19:21.468 --> 00:19:28.294]  Now the low-level, kind of porch transhumanist, like porch masons, don't know or haven't read the real dogma, but...
[00:19:30.293 --> 00:19:37.059]  Aldous Huxley's brother, the head UN eugenicist, the head eugenicist worldwide at the time, he said, we've got to change to transhumanism.
[00:19:37.539 --> 00:19:58.076]  So transhumanism, the founder of it says, it is the new name for eugenics, and he says, and now they say at these big eugenics conferences, transhumanist conferences they have, or post-humanists, they say, you will take brain chips, you will evolve into cybernetic, if we even let you, if you prove your worth, and all the rest of you will die because you're not evolving.
[00:19:58.636 --> 00:20:01.119]  And so, you know, we face it on that front.
[00:20:02.361 --> 00:20:04.484]  Yes, as I say, it's all out in the open today.
[00:20:05.165 --> 00:20:10.271]  And what's interesting, too, is their use of words or linguistics.
[00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:12.434]  Some call it psycho linguistics.
[00:20:13.237 --> 00:20:23.843]  And some of the neuroscientists call it neurolinguistics by the use of different words to cover up the same agenda that used to be called eugenics.
[00:20:24.303 --> 00:20:28.106]  The general population are using those new words thinking it's all okay.
[00:20:28.126 --> 00:20:29.967]  They can't relate it to what it used to mean.
[00:20:31.227 --> 00:20:38.272]  It's the same thing as having a communist society and as long as no one at the top mentions communism, no one will see for what it really is.
[00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:42.334]  So we tend to get stuck on words we can't see beyond that.
[00:20:43.398 --> 00:20:48.522]  Today they call it globalization, but it is a sovietized world system they're bringing in.
[00:20:48.562 --> 00:20:51.705]  It's a communistic system they're bringing in for the masses.
[00:20:52.345 --> 00:20:56.128]  Now communism or the Soviet system was created by the West.
[00:20:56.168 --> 00:20:58.910]  It did not originate in the Soviet Union or Russia.
[00:20:59.851 --> 00:21:11.740]  Its whole theory was that man was an animal that can be trained to go in any direction whatsoever through scientific means and indoctrination and using conditioned responses
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.101]  Uh, they could take them to wherever they wanted them to be.
[00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:21.502]  Lenin himself said, he said, we shall decide, uh, what kind of culture to give the public, which is good for the party.
[00:21:21.922 --> 00:21:26.684]  And if that culture becomes obsolete or doesn't serve the party, we'll then change the entire culture again.
[00:21:26.704 --> 00:21:34.666]  In other words, all of reality will keep changing and be updated and the public will accept it like a computer program being upgraded.
[00:21:34.686 --> 00:21:37.326]  That's exactly how they're treating the public today.
[00:21:37.586 --> 00:21:39.467]  And unfortunately it's working very well.
[00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:42.009]  Alan Watt, long segment coming up.
[00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.932]  When we start the next hour, we'll go directly to your phone calls.
[00:21:44.952 --> 00:21:46.574]  If you want to get lined up, 800-259-9231.
[00:21:46.954 --> 00:21:49.337]  Stay with us.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.781]  We're on the march.
[00:21:54.281 --> 00:21:55.883]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:56.804 --> 00:21:59.487]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:02.637 --> 00:22:05.919]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:10.161]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:22:10.341 --> 00:22:21.767]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:27.830]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:32.495]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[00:22:32.795 --> 00:22:40.804]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[00:22:40.984 --> 00:22:47.651]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare.
[00:22:51.847 --> 00:22:57.248]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:22:57.268 --> 00:23:00.729]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:23:00.749 --> 00:23:04.369]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:23:04.409 --> 00:23:09.030]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.371]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:12.451 --> 00:23:15.291]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:19.272]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:23:19.312 --> 00:23:20.212]  Do you listen?
[00:23:28.644 --> 00:23:33.533]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:37.293 --> 00:23:39.554]  How dare you?
[00:23:39.734 --> 00:23:44.775]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:44.955 --> 00:23:47.596]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:47.696 --> 00:23:53.898]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:24:55.133 --> 00:24:56.554]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:56.594 --> 00:24:58.955]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:25:17.671 --> 00:25:18.452]  Alan Watts.
[00:25:19.312 --> 00:25:24.696]  Let's get into what the establishment is doing with genetic engineering.
[00:25:26.237 --> 00:25:31.261]  I have interviewed and, of course, read hundreds and hundreds of news stories and reports.
[00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:44.631]  As I know, you have top scientists in genetic engineering who were for it until they found out that, well, I change one gene in a tomato or potato and it gets the change I want, but it randomly, each life cycle,
[00:25:46.647 --> 00:26:00.895]  It changes hundreds if not thousands of things randomly and creates new amino acids, new chemicals, new components, new ring structures, new enzymes that are very, very toxic to other life forms that consume it or come in contact with it.
[00:26:02.215 --> 00:26:03.416]  The establishment knows that.
[00:26:04.416 --> 00:26:06.998]  They are testing in the open ocean.
[00:26:08.098 --> 00:26:21.107]  New forms of chemical-eating bacteria, oil-slick-eating bacteria, which in studies they admit could start replicating and, you know, could create global red tides that could possibly kill a lot of the life in the ocean.
[00:26:21.127 --> 00:26:22.348]  That's, you know, one little example.
[00:26:22.828 --> 00:26:33.896]  Or these cross-species, where they put human genes in a pig so they can get heart valves out of it, or grow, which they know, which they admit they're doing, but they keep a lot of the details quiet for at least a decade, BBC reports.
[00:26:34.716 --> 00:27:02.288]  Humanoids, part human, part bovine, part cow, so they can grow the embryos up to full baby size, so they can harvest organs, we know that's going on, part chimpanzee, part human, part human, part goat, part goat, part spider, or they have some transgenetic organisms that have over 200 different species, plant, animal, jellyfish, they're selling on the open market, cats that glow in the dark, monkeys that glow in the dark,
[00:27:03.008 --> 00:27:07.991]  That have jellyfish skin, and you tell the public, they laugh and giggle and say that doesn't exist.
[00:27:09.172 --> 00:27:22.379]  But even though it's on the market, you know, just thousands of things randomly going on, huge facilities randomly with gene guns, firing different genetics into plants, animals, sea life openly releasing them.
[00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:27.402]  You know, now there's many areas of the world more GMO salmon than there are the other salmon.
[00:27:27.422 --> 00:27:30.924]  They're now out competing them, removing them, and then they have a
[00:27:31.184 --> 00:27:31.524]  We're good to go.
[00:27:50.951 --> 00:27:57.735]  In fact, if we get bored, we may just nuke the planet because of the power of killing ourselves and destroying the species forever.
[00:27:57.775 --> 00:27:58.475]  It's so beautiful.
[00:27:58.835 --> 00:28:05.019]  And Lennon said, you know, I would love to just write poems about destroying the earth and killing everyone and how beautiful it would be.
[00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:07.520]  So really, they're not survival of the fittest.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:17.325]  A true fittest would understand the species, have love for it, would have compassion, would be endowed, you know, that strain of our species with
[00:28:20.367 --> 00:28:35.812]  Understanding how dangerous this all is, moving carefully with it, trying to empower everyone, trying to lift the species to a higher level, peacefully trying to colonize space instead of dumbing down, hoarding, controlling, poisoning, and endangering the entire biosphere.
[00:28:35.832 --> 00:28:37.232]  And that's a long two-minute question.
[00:28:37.733 --> 00:28:41.054]  Specifically, you know, with that whole field of information,
[00:28:42.214 --> 00:28:47.217]  I see them as actually very aberrant and self-destructive, and in their own words, they admit that.
[00:28:47.277 --> 00:28:49.038]  So they need to be removed from power right now.
[00:28:49.318 --> 00:28:53.480]  They're mid-level servants who are just in the power trip of killing 90% and running things.
[00:28:54.041 --> 00:28:58.503]  I don't think they've studied their own master's blueprint that really, at the end of the day, they just want to kill everybody, including themselves.
[00:28:59.944 --> 00:29:11.270]  It's possible, but what I've also noticed too, for many years, is that whatever is released to the public to do with science is generally obsolete.
[00:29:12.068 --> 00:29:12.148]  The
[00:29:28.685 --> 00:29:30.867]  They really discovered the genes we are told.
[00:29:31.428 --> 00:29:40.055]  They were still teaching in the 70s, the 60s and 70s, in medicine that they suspected that genes lived on chromosomes, but they couldn't prove it.
[00:29:40.575 --> 00:29:49.583]  And yet here's Huxley writing in 1933 about a science that had not even come in at that time in the general universities.
[00:29:49.623 --> 00:29:53.686]  And mass drugging of the public and forced abortions and total control.
[00:29:53.886 --> 00:29:55.227]  What they're now setting up.
[00:29:55.268 --> 00:29:55.548]  Go ahead.
[00:29:56.397 --> 00:30:10.601]  And at the same point, when you break it down to genes to do with the Human Genome Project, basically that thing was on the go once again before they were so advanced in understanding the genes.
[00:30:10.621 --> 00:30:12.282]  So who's telling the truth?
[00:30:12.322 --> 00:30:20.184]  The ones who are doing the research at the bottom and learning it all over again, or a much higher group above them that already knows all of this stuff.
[00:30:20.664 --> 00:30:24.185]  And what we find with the Elite Two, they have incredible faith
[00:30:24.685 --> 00:30:31.048]  Absolute faith in their own ingenuity and with the use of science they believe they can go on forever indefinitely.
[00:30:31.388 --> 00:30:35.370]  And I think that a very high level of ironed all of these problems out.
[00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.511]  They talk about re-seeding the planet if need be.
[00:30:38.951 --> 00:30:46.514]  They have warehouses, storehouses, where they have all the genes of the entire planet of plant, insects, animal and so on.
[00:30:46.734 --> 00:30:50.016]  So they have the giant underground labyrinths that they admit they have.
[00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:50.556]  Lord knows what
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.621]  What they have that we're not aware of and so they're prepared for that.
[00:30:54.661 --> 00:30:58.583]  That may be even in their plan is to wreck everything to then rebuild it.
[00:30:58.923 --> 00:30:59.924]  It could very well be.
[00:31:00.084 --> 00:31:07.107]  I remember watching one of the Star Trek movies and remember Gene Roddenberry was a member of NASA.
[00:31:07.367 --> 00:31:08.827]  The Genesis Project.
[00:31:09.168 --> 00:31:10.288]  The Genesis Project, yeah.
[00:31:10.668 --> 00:31:17.211]  And he was also a member of the First Earth Army to start the greening process for conservation and really to conserve humans.
[00:31:20.477 --> 00:31:30.382]  So he wrote it into that and they had one episode in one of the movie versions where they called it the Genesis Project where they reseeded a whole planet and started it off from scratch.
[00:31:31.163 --> 00:31:34.064]  And these characters didn't dream up this stuff.
[00:31:34.084 --> 00:31:38.066]  They already had plans to do this kind of thing if they needed to do it on planet Earth itself.
[00:31:38.666 --> 00:31:39.407]  And I am certain
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:54.887]  That if by some fluke they don't get their way, because they do hold all the powers or the reins of power across the planet today, if they don't get their way, they will have something up their sleeves where they would go ahead and pull us off.
[00:31:55.347 --> 00:32:02.790]  Because they truly have utter faith in their own ability and acquired knowledge of sciences that's hidden from the public.
[00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.972]  We, as I say, we get obsolete stuff at the bottom level.
[00:32:07.033 --> 00:32:08.273]  That's why they call it research.
[00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:10.094]  It's been done before at a higher level.
[00:32:11.694 --> 00:32:12.814]  We'll take Ian Fleming.
[00:32:12.854 --> 00:32:14.014]  I mentioned this yesterday.
[00:32:14.115 --> 00:32:27.337]  In the early fifties, he writes his second book, James Bond, Moonraker, where the elite are going to kill everybody, go to a space station, and then come back after the biological weapons killed everyone, and reseat with the eugenic superculture.
[00:32:27.717 --> 00:32:31.098]  This is a high-level MI6 agent, OSS agent,
[00:32:31.698 --> 00:32:41.084]  And then now their newest James Bond is where there's a fake global environmental group using fake carbon taxes to bring in a world tyranny.
[00:32:41.484 --> 00:32:43.525]  They're just flaunting it in our face.
[00:32:43.665 --> 00:32:45.126]  Yes, they are flaunting it in our face.
[00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:51.730]  And it's interesting, the World Wildlife Fund has what they call three arcs on the planet.
[00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.091]  One of them is in Louisiana.
[00:32:54.261 --> 00:33:02.066]  And in there they have cryogenics with, again, every possible gene from every possible animal, insect, etc.
[00:33:02.206 --> 00:33:04.147]  in those particular arcs.
[00:33:04.788 --> 00:33:12.232]  And they said, and this program is a public broadcasting program with a professor who's in charge of that particular one arc.
[00:33:12.432 --> 00:33:13.113]  She said there's three.
[00:33:14.006 --> 00:33:16.768]  That this will be used if anything happened to planet Earth.
[00:33:16.788 --> 00:33:19.169]  They can reseed the planet with everything they have there.
[00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.890]  And they've tested this stuff out.
[00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:30.836]  They have brought ovum and sperm together from different creatures and they've inserted them into other types of creatures and successfully brought them to term.
[00:33:31.236 --> 00:33:42.403]  So they can literally breed any kind of animal or even a human inside another animal if need be and bring it to term after being stored in cryogenics for who knows how long.
[00:33:45.439 --> 00:33:49.263]  So we're talking about dolphins with human brains.
[00:33:49.843 --> 00:33:50.424]  It's endless.
[00:33:50.644 --> 00:33:52.586]  Well, I agree with what you just said.
[00:33:52.646 --> 00:33:57.610]  I believe that, well we know, that they're at least 30, 40 years ahead and that's exponential.
[00:33:58.091 --> 00:33:59.732]  And so that's why they're so arrogant now.
[00:34:01.033 --> 00:34:04.635]  In the time frame, how do you see them with the soft kill weapons?
[00:34:04.655 --> 00:34:17.500]  They've already turned up the ambient background with the soft kill weapons, with the cancer viruses, with the barium and aluminum spraying on the public, with their operations worldwide.
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:24.982]  Go through the next ten years and then out, and I understand this is a projection from your deep research,
[00:34:26.403 --> 00:34:32.105]  But I've done my separate research, and that's what I'm always so impressed with, is that you're always on the same line, and even bring it further in many cases.
[00:34:32.465 --> 00:34:33.706]  That's why we're so honored to have you, Alan.
[00:34:33.746 --> 00:34:42.408]  I just really respect your intellect and research on this, because I've come to the same organic analysis as you are here, with my discernment.
[00:34:42.749 --> 00:34:50.371]  And discernment's really just your full mind capacity, the electrochemical computer you have, listeners, integrating all the information.
[00:34:51.432 --> 00:34:52.592]  And of course, their own statements.
[00:34:54.207 --> 00:35:07.794]  Break down specifically when you believe they'll start mass plagues or smaller plagues to get us herded into cities, to train us to live under total control, into more of a THX 1138 type system, rats in the cage.
[00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:10.996]  When do the mass culls come?
[00:35:11.536 --> 00:35:14.458]  And will they use neutron bombs, as the Ministry of Defense says they may?
[00:35:15.039 --> 00:35:20.382]  Or will they use special, race-specific weapons, blaming it on imaginary terror groups and caves?
[00:35:21.103 --> 00:35:27.247]  And how will these phases unfold, and in what time frame, for the, I always said 80% extermination.
[00:35:27.267 --> 00:35:28.368]  That's in the public documents.
[00:35:28.428 --> 00:35:31.990]  Now they're, in the newest documents, saying, well really, it's 99%.
[00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:33.951]  We just told our underlings 80%.
[00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:37.233]  It's really, we're going to kill 99% of people.
[00:35:37.293 --> 00:35:37.874]  So, go ahead.
[00:35:38.928 --> 00:35:54.532]  Yes, when you go into the records of the think tanks that advise NATO, for instance, and the US military as well, they're identical, they're all identical, all the projections for the future.
[00:35:54.932 --> 00:36:01.054]  And this starts really with a statement right after 9-11, 2001, where they said this will be a hundred years war.
[00:36:02.262 --> 00:36:06.123]  And everyone was shaking their head, saying, well, why would it take a hundred years to finish off the Middle East?
[00:36:06.443 --> 00:36:07.743]  They weren't talking about the Middle East.
[00:36:07.763 --> 00:36:11.064]  They were talking about a long-term strategy plan for the entire planet.
[00:36:12.204 --> 00:36:16.985]  And these think tanks, in their own records, will always use history.
[00:36:17.025 --> 00:36:19.165]  They'll tell you where they get their ideas from.
[00:36:19.745 --> 00:36:25.546]  They go back into the Middle Ages, where they had plagues rampaging across the whole of Europe.
[00:36:26.206 --> 00:36:30.107]  But during those plague times, too, when many people were dying, millions of people died.
[00:36:30.748 --> 00:36:45.739]  They also had incredible wars going on at the same time, and the effects on the general populations were studied even then, often by monks who did the documentation, to see the effects on the public, who were truly mind-bombed.
[00:36:45.759 --> 00:36:54.425]  They were so afraid that the plague was going to get them, so much so, they'd allow armies to march through and pillage their food from them and their livestock, etc.
[00:36:55.386 --> 00:36:57.067]  And so when you see what they've dreamed up,
[00:36:57.859 --> 00:37:03.582]  In their documentation as a projection for the next 30 to 100 years for the military.
[00:37:04.623 --> 00:37:05.704]  It ties right in with that.
[00:37:05.744 --> 00:37:16.110]  They say that they expect starting around 2010, 2012, we will be a global society de facto.
[00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:17.711]  It will be signed into law.
[00:37:18.351 --> 00:37:21.053]  But then the plagues are coming.
[00:37:21.113 --> 00:37:22.314]  They expect them to come.
[00:37:22.894 --> 00:37:24.575]  So we'll have plagues just like the Middle Ages.
[00:37:25.379 --> 00:37:25.979]  Pandemics.
[00:37:26.299 --> 00:37:36.442]  Now, pandemics are ideal for bringing down a population of even the whole world, but not too suddenly, because a pandemic can be contained within an area.
[00:37:36.462 --> 00:37:41.763]  It can die off and reappear two or three years later and kill off more in the same area.
[00:37:42.123 --> 00:37:43.744]  So it's a long-term takedown.
[00:37:43.784 --> 00:37:47.125]  That way, the people who are alive can bury the dead.
[00:37:47.185 --> 00:37:48.005]  It's not untidy.
[00:37:48.265 --> 00:37:50.225]  They're all out of sight, etc.
[00:37:50.365 --> 00:37:52.306]  So we clean up our own mess as we die off.
[00:37:53.414 --> 00:37:58.776]  And at the same time, they expect there's going to be massive food shortages, which they had again in the Middle Ages.
[00:38:00.217 --> 00:38:18.965]  And in the Middle Ages, where you had various armies competing with each other and kings for power in different countries, you're going to have a global society here where the people will be revolting for lack of food because of the food supply of the world is now tied up into about five corporations hands.
[00:38:19.905 --> 00:38:22.206]  And we know the United Nations, under their own mandate,
[00:38:22.765 --> 00:38:22.965]  I think?
[00:38:38.638 --> 00:38:42.880]  For maximum population, the next year they're going to down that quota again.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:48.223]  We know we told you this, but there's not enough food to go around, so you have to bring down your population.
[00:38:48.583 --> 00:38:52.785]  So each country, it'll be up to them to bring down their numbers one way or another.
[00:38:53.506 --> 00:39:03.811]  And at the same time this is happening, you're going to have a world military managing the riots to do with food primarily, and lack of necessities and medicines and so on.
[00:39:04.837 --> 00:39:05.138]  I think so.
[00:39:29.546 --> 00:39:43.469]  And they believe then that China will start to decline massively because even now I think their population is two to three or three males to every one female because they're encouraging infanticide there is mainly on the female.
[00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:52.276]  And therefore they themselves will start to decline and because once they're on the westernized food and inoculations they will also start to become sterile.
[00:39:52.696 --> 00:40:01.802]  So within another say 2030 to 2050, 2060 the population of China will be drastically reduced as well.
[00:40:02.323 --> 00:40:10.749]  So this is how they see the whole plan working out and then they tie in the transhumanism agenda where they'll bring out a new type
[00:40:11.249 --> 00:40:12.010]  We're good to go.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.501]  Uh, and they'll be very, very efficient.
[00:40:35.601 --> 00:40:40.164]  And they can also be programmed to do different jobs because they'll also be part cyborg.
[00:40:40.624 --> 00:40:43.306]  That's really what they believe at the top.
[00:40:43.626 --> 00:40:46.088]  And this is through all the records of academia.
[00:40:46.795 --> 00:40:48.016]  To do with transhumanism.
[00:41:17.355 --> 00:41:20.656]  To rebel, the teenagers, to take the augmentation.
[00:41:20.696 --> 00:41:30.319]  And then now, one of the most famous video game company owners and inventors came out and said, yes, soon you'll need to be augmented with chips in your body to even play our game.
[00:41:30.819 --> 00:41:33.279]  And the young people are already in their Sims reality.
[00:41:33.319 --> 00:41:35.900]  They're, you know, 20 million people in World of Warcraft.
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.540]  This is their reality.
[00:41:37.981 --> 00:41:39.481]  And so they're already being inserted into it.
[00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:42.782]  And the Army said, we're going to use Xboxes now.
[00:41:45.442 --> 00:42:01.398]  The very platform to have the teenagers fly our Predator drones, and so they'll just sit there having fun dehumanizing, killing people, playing real games on an Xbox platform, hooked into the Predator drones, and then now they're at the malls with these huge video game displays.
[00:42:01.438 --> 00:42:03.721]  The Army, that's in the news today, all over the country.
[00:42:04.681 --> 00:42:19.454]  Showing them simulated battle attacks, or recordings of it, of real attacks, to teach them how much fun it is to be involved there piloting the robotic craft, and the entire military, by 2012, with the aircraft, the attack craft, is converting
[00:42:20.835 --> 00:42:36.424]  Uh... into drones and then of course the humans are phased out because a tiny elite can then program the entire military apparatus that is serviced in these giant aircraft carrier sized land-based, ground-based, air-based
[00:42:36.864 --> 00:42:48.229]  Repair centers that are robotic with basic human technicians that upkeep it to where the elite can just punch a button and launch giant attacks against countries and it won't matter if the troops even said no.
[00:42:48.509 --> 00:42:53.271]  So literal god-like powers now being seeded into the hands of the elite.
[00:42:53.991 --> 00:42:55.012]  Alan Watts, stay there.
[00:42:55.032 --> 00:42:57.193]  We're going to come back and get into the carbon footprint.
[00:42:58.073 --> 00:43:00.875]  Uh, the social youth brigades that are going to be in all your homes.
[00:43:01.315 --> 00:43:02.716]  Just the absolute enslavement.
[00:43:02.736 --> 00:43:04.057]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:43:04.238 --> 00:43:05.679]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:43:05.979 --> 00:43:08.220]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:13.404]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:43:13.804 --> 00:43:16.626]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:44:01.633 --> 00:44:08.800]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:09.161 --> 00:44:10.843]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:12.796]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:13.837]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:14.137 --> 00:44:15.118]  This is his MO.
[00:44:15.139 --> 00:44:16.420]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.202]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:18.482 --> 00:44:25.249]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:25.649 --> 00:44:26.090]  Some U.S.
[00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:31.796]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:32.456 --> 00:44:35.917]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:35.937 --> 00:44:38.118]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:02.426 --> 00:45:12.514]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[00:46:15.754 --> 00:46:23.041]  I'm sorry to some out there who are laughing at us right now.
[00:46:23.061 --> 00:46:27.645]  Who've been neutralized psychologically by the controllers.
[00:46:31.008 --> 00:46:34.651]  Because your own false identity that you've constructed for you
[00:46:37.097 --> 00:46:42.401]  Is what you believe is your intellect or your being is a false construct.
[00:46:42.441 --> 00:46:44.803]  So you can't go against who you believe you are.
[00:46:44.843 --> 00:46:46.685]  You have to deny what we're saying.
[00:46:47.025 --> 00:46:47.905]  It's all documented.
[00:46:49.226 --> 00:46:53.890]  Because you feel like your own enslavement is your soul.
[00:46:56.492 --> 00:46:59.674]  That's very sad because we need to try to avert this.
[00:46:59.734 --> 00:47:00.835]  We need to try to reverse this.
[00:47:00.855 --> 00:47:02.797]  We have a limited window in time in my opinion.
[00:47:04.534 --> 00:47:13.077]  To reverse what's happening, Alan, digressing for a moment, do you think we are in that limited window?
[00:47:13.157 --> 00:47:20.819]  I want to get into solutions later, and then B, continuing with the phasing out of humanity.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.300]  I think we're well underway.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:29.162]  We didn't know that we were being sterilized until the reports came out.
[00:47:29.562 --> 00:47:32.263]  The reports I've had for 50 years started to leak out.
[00:47:32.961 --> 00:47:37.124]  So we get the news 50 years later, and this is how things are done.
[00:47:37.164 --> 00:47:40.967]  We're the last to be told any truth, or at least even effects of the truth.
[00:47:41.807 --> 00:47:44.729]  And they're well on their way to their objective.
[00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:47.331]  We're watching them go through this financial nonsense.
[00:47:47.771 --> 00:47:51.174]  This is the power of the purse, the last thing to be used to unite the whole planet.
[00:47:52.382 --> 00:47:56.903]  And because we're all on the one economic system, we know no other way.
[00:47:56.923 --> 00:47:57.963]  This is all we've been given.
[00:47:58.003 --> 00:48:01.244]  This is all we can remember for thousands, a couple of thousand years.
[00:48:02.144 --> 00:48:04.485]  Then there seems to be no way out of it.
[00:48:06.165 --> 00:48:12.687]  So the power of the purse is going to force everyone along into the next phase of control.
[00:48:13.087 --> 00:48:16.088]  Money is used, remember, mainly as a tool by the elite.
[00:48:16.128 --> 00:48:17.148]  They don't need money.
[00:48:18.068 --> 00:48:20.429]  They already own everything, technically.
[00:48:21.092 --> 00:48:23.793]  They don't have to carry cash with them or even credit cards.
[00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:25.994]  Doors open wherever they go.
[00:48:26.615 --> 00:48:32.378]  But money is the trick to control the people and to get us to work along with their system for their system.
[00:48:33.478 --> 00:48:35.079]  Eventually, they won't even need that.
[00:48:36.159 --> 00:48:45.524]  But part of the phase on the way to the elimination of money for their brave new worlds will be a credit system that will come in for every citizen.
[00:48:45.944 --> 00:48:48.285]  And Bertrand Russell talked about this back in the 1950s.
[00:48:49.679 --> 00:48:58.908]  Where the government, in collusion with the banks, will directly give you, into your account every week, a deposit which you cannot save up.
[00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:01.211]  So it starts at the same figure every Monday.
[00:49:02.236 --> 00:49:08.479]  And if you go against the system, you don't behave in a certain way or whatever, they will hold back your credits.
[00:49:08.719 --> 00:49:10.239]  You can't pay your rent and so on.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.241]  And this is going to be used as a form of social control.
[00:49:13.661 --> 00:49:19.703]  So we see with this present government bank merger system that's coming in, that's right on with the agenda.
[00:49:20.344 --> 00:49:26.566]  And the government will eventually be right into your account and they will use it as a tool to control you.
[00:49:26.586 --> 00:49:31.128]  If you've been a bad boy, no more money for a few weeks until you bend a knee.
[00:49:31.889 --> 00:49:37.493]  And this is coming in, and I'm certain this is what's going to come out of this whole globalized monetary system they're bringing in right now.
[00:49:37.853 --> 00:49:39.434]  And again, they create all the crises.
[00:49:39.454 --> 00:49:42.316]  They release the biological agents, then they offer the solution.
[00:49:42.356 --> 00:49:45.158]  They engineer the economic crisis, they offer the solution.
[00:49:45.198 --> 00:49:55.845]  They slip in the Chinese slave goods out of China, and then they say, okay, we passed a law that nobody in America can weave clothes for their children, and we're banning any production in textiles in the U.S.
[00:49:55.925 --> 00:49:58.667]  or anywhere else, unless it's certified by the government.
[00:49:59.267 --> 00:50:05.850]  Which then knocks out all the good clothes made properly to where we can only have the GMO cotton and the bad stuff from India and China.
[00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:07.591]  I mean, it's all happening.
[00:50:07.611 --> 00:50:13.694]  We see them raiding watermelon farms that are selling watermelons, or raiding people selling milk, or raiding people selling eggs.
[00:50:14.014 --> 00:50:22.258]  They're obsessed with shutting down any grassroots, agrarian, self-sufficient societies, which shows that's one of their weak points, isn't it?
[00:50:23.178 --> 00:50:24.699]  It is one of their weak points, indeed, yes.
[00:50:26.363 --> 00:50:30.825]  Back in 70 seconds, Alan, let's talk about that and talk about solutions and things we can do to fight this.
[00:50:30.845 --> 00:50:36.048]  And I want to get into chemtrails with you and our carbon footprint, how that's going to be controlled.
[00:50:36.468 --> 00:50:38.709]  And then we'll go to your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:38.849 --> 00:50:40.490]  Final hour, straight ahead.
[00:50:44.432 --> 00:50:45.992]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:52.395 --> 00:50:54.057]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:50:54.357 --> 00:50:57.781]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:50:57.981 --> 00:50:59.803]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:03.167]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:51:03.468 --> 00:51:07.312]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[00:51:07.312 --> 00:51:07.552]  We're good.
[00:51:37.312 --> 00:51:39.394]  Exclusive audio interviews and so much more.
[00:51:39.714 --> 00:51:42.216]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.

[00:51:50.523 --> 00:51:51.844]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:54.967 --> 00:51:56.889]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:57.369 --> 00:52:00.132]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:10.871 --> 00:52:14.755]  All right, final hour on this final broadcast of this week.
[00:52:14.915 --> 00:52:15.836]  First week of the new year.
[00:52:16.317 --> 00:52:18.680]  We're back live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.384]  And of course next week for a few of the days, Jason Marmus is here in town.
[00:52:23.125 --> 00:52:27.049]  He'll be sitting in with a lot of important and informative guests coming up.
[00:52:27.269 --> 00:52:27.450]  Now,
[00:52:29.085 --> 00:52:31.768]  I want to go back to Alan Watt.
[00:52:31.808 --> 00:52:35.391]  Alan, we've been having riveting, informative discussion here.
[00:52:35.511 --> 00:52:36.572]  People say we're being negative.
[00:52:36.592 --> 00:52:36.932]  We're not.
[00:52:36.952 --> 00:52:39.535]  It's like looking out your window and seeing a storm coming in.
[00:52:39.555 --> 00:52:40.896]  Somebody says, what's the weather?
[00:52:40.916 --> 00:52:41.777]  Oh, a storm's coming in.
[00:52:41.817 --> 00:52:42.558]  Oh, don't be negative.
[00:52:45.905 --> 00:52:48.006]  All we're doing is covering the facts here, the reality.
[00:52:48.447 --> 00:52:55.211]  You alluded about 15 minutes ago to the carbon footprint, the allotted amount of cred you'll have on your card.
[00:52:56.112 --> 00:52:57.072]  All of this is admitted.
[00:52:57.412 --> 00:53:02.616]  You know, even if you, quote, have wealth, you won't be able to spend it because it'll be past your carbon footprint.
[00:53:02.636 --> 00:53:05.017]  And then, of course, that will all be selectively
[00:53:06.357 --> 00:53:07.458]  Selectively enforced.
[00:53:07.498 --> 00:53:11.842]  I mean, this is the total controlled society with the technology to try to carry it out.
[00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:16.487]  So can you speak more about life under the carbon footprint which they're now bringing in?
[00:53:16.547 --> 00:53:20.090]  Obama says you'll have weekly, monthly visits to your farm, your home.
[00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:22.732]  You'll get special permits to do any changes to your house.
[00:53:24.013 --> 00:53:32.780]  Cows, $170 tax, soda, but then all foods, satellite boxes in all your cars, taxing you as you drive.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:37.684]  They're now saying it all, everything we warn people about that was in the planning documents we saw decades ago.
[00:53:39.245 --> 00:53:39.965]  We're now here.
[00:53:40.326 --> 00:53:51.014]  In this continuum, from the early elites forming and the scientific dictatorship several thousand years ago to now, how far along on that continuum towards what they believe is their endgame are we?
[00:53:51.034 --> 00:53:51.574]  Are we 80% there, 90% there?
[00:53:53.317 --> 00:53:54.879]  I think we're probably 90% there.
[00:53:55.679 --> 00:53:57.381]  That's why it is in the open now.
[00:53:58.042 --> 00:53:59.583]  And they're not really concerned.
[00:53:59.863 --> 00:54:03.947]  They have all of the classes they need.
[00:54:04.227 --> 00:54:06.890]  It's mainly academia on their side.
[00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:14.357]  They fund so many of the big corporations, even with the bailouts, the corporations must do as they're told as well.
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:15.240]  Thank you.
[00:54:37.048 --> 00:54:39.510]  But you're quite right with this whole carbon thing.
[00:54:40.291 --> 00:54:42.473]  See, man is the problem according to them.
[00:54:42.493 --> 00:54:43.754]  There's too many of us.
[00:54:44.494 --> 00:54:49.178]  And everything that we need or use gives off carbon in the manufacturing.
[00:54:49.898 --> 00:54:53.301]  Even down to creating a house for you to live in is a problem.
[00:54:53.881 --> 00:54:56.543]  And that's another way they're getting people off the land.
[00:54:56.844 --> 00:55:01.227]  They started voluntary programs to come in and test your house from the government.
[00:55:01.627 --> 00:55:04.870]  The government puts so much money towards you re-insulating it, etc.
[00:55:05.925 --> 00:55:14.490]  And that that scheme was to get us all used to the idea of government coming in and testing our houses to see if they were worthy enough to stand up or be knocked down.
[00:55:15.131 --> 00:55:16.872]  And eventually that will become mandatory.
[00:55:17.112 --> 00:55:24.296]  They want the people off the land, according to Agenda 21, the United Nations program, into these big overcrowded cities.
[00:55:25.017 --> 00:55:26.678]  And that's where they plan to contain us.
[00:55:27.038 --> 00:55:33.902]  That ties right in with why they have not been upgrading the main cities for many, many years.
[00:55:33.942 --> 00:55:34.542]  They're in a mess.
[00:55:34.662 --> 00:55:35.423]  The roads are a mess.
[00:55:35.888 --> 00:55:49.592]  They admitted in Toronto, for instance, that it would be almost cheaper to build a brand new city than to fix the sewage systems, the roads and so on, than to be easier to start from scratch.
[00:55:50.012 --> 00:55:52.212]  In other words, they don't intend to maintain those cities.
[00:55:52.472 --> 00:56:01.215]  These have to be simply to contain the public for a period of 30 to 40 years until the public are pretty well all dead and gone.
[00:56:03.041 --> 00:56:11.748]  The whole carbon idea came up from a big think tank that works with all the other big think tanks, well-funded, interconnected with them, and that's the Club of Rome.
[00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:26.340]  And the founders of the Club of Rome wrote a book in the 1990s, but they said in the 1970s they were the ones who came up with the idea to unite the planet and claim that mankind was having a war on the Earth itself.
[00:56:27.583 --> 00:56:35.611]  And it's a sick joke because we're a carbon-based life form.
[00:56:36.011 --> 00:56:42.457]  Everything on this planet is carbon-based and they're saying it's going to be a toxic waste but all their genetic engineering, all their toxic waste dumping,
[00:56:42.797 --> 00:56:43.558]  That's okay.
[00:56:43.838 --> 00:56:49.563]  It's only carbon dioxide and other gases that come off of life forms, which is all part of the life cycle.
[00:56:49.883 --> 00:56:55.047]  They're waging war on the life cycle itself and saying they're going to micromanage and tax every facet.
[00:56:55.307 --> 00:56:57.529]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[00:56:57.929 --> 00:57:01.332]  It is a tax on the life-giving gas itself.
[00:57:02.533 --> 00:57:08.918]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:57:09.298 --> 00:57:10.960]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:57:11.932 --> 00:57:12.953]  But who is the enemy?
[00:57:13.473 --> 00:57:13.953]  Bin Laden.
[00:57:14.253 --> 00:57:15.274]  This is his M.O.
[00:57:15.294 --> 00:57:16.575]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:57:16.615 --> 00:57:18.256]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:57:18.616 --> 00:57:25.380]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:26.220]  Some U.S.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:31.944]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:57:32.604 --> 00:57:36.087]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:57:36.107 --> 00:57:38.910]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:58:03.138 --> 00:58:14.885]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.
[00:58:15.465 --> 00:58:18.007]  Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[00:58:18.627 --> 00:58:25.370]  Between now and January 20th, 2009, all food units U1 through U7 are being offered at wholesale prices.
[00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:27.390]  That's a 33% savings.
[00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:30.992]  A year's supply of meals starts as low as 73 cents per meal.
[00:58:31.412 --> 00:58:40.655]  Ready Reserve Food offers only the highest quality dehydrated food, packed in double enameled cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere, allowing a 15 plus year shelf life.
[00:58:41.135 --> 00:58:44.116]  Ready Reserve has been manufacturing since 1972, giving them the freedom to offer
[00:58:48.976 --> 00:58:49.216]  I think so.
[00:59:02.321 --> 00:59:05.244]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:59:05.404 --> 00:59:10.688]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:59:10.928 --> 00:59:16.313]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:17.774]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.134 --> 00:59:27.022]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:59:27.442 --> 00:59:29.063]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:59:29.283 --> 00:59:33.444]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[00:59:33.484 --> 00:59:38.126]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[00:59:38.506 --> 00:59:40.166]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[00:59:42.347 --> 00:59:43.108]  Keep it natural.
[00:59:43.428 --> 00:59:51.573]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[00:59:51.833 --> 00:59:56.056]  Try Calbin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[00:59:56.076 --> 01:00:00.979]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.681]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:06.142 --> 01:00:08.943]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.215 --> 01:00:13.436]  Going to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:24.062]  Before I do that, I wanted to give Alan a little time to talk about any issues he thinks are most important, instead of just my questions and our analysis back and forth.
[01:00:24.082 --> 01:00:27.024]  Before we do that, I want to tell you who's made this show possible today.
[01:00:27.084 --> 01:00:30.526]  These are great products that I fully endorse, use, and believe in.
[01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:32.787]  Number one is Acola Blue.
[01:00:33.647 --> 01:00:36.229]  Acola Blue is just an amazing, high-quality
[01:00:37.978 --> 01:00:40.340]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.782]  Pays for itself with one year if you buy your water from the store.
[01:00:43.123 --> 01:00:44.644]  Pure clean water without the fluoride.
[01:00:44.664 --> 01:00:46.085]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[01:00:46.525 --> 01:00:48.988]  Machine produces up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours.
[01:00:49.008 --> 01:00:50.028]  7.5 gallons.
[01:00:50.048 --> 01:00:50.909]  That's their smaller unit.
[01:00:51.229 --> 01:00:52.430]  Great tasting pure H2O.
[01:00:52.511 --> 01:00:53.792]  Exactly the way nature makes it.
[01:00:53.832 --> 01:00:55.273]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[01:00:55.713 --> 01:00:56.574]  Neutral pH.
[01:00:56.934 --> 01:01:03.820]  Then it goes through an activated carbon filter, then a silver impregnated carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system, and a taste and food
[01:01:04.921 --> 01:01:06.081]  Another great sponsor,

[01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:45.130]  We have a lot of videos, free videos you can watch or audios you can listen to at the website, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:01:47.854 --> 01:01:50.618]  And you need to give them a call, because self-sufficiency is the key.
[01:01:51.038 --> 01:02:02.914]  And if you're buying seeds, moving to the country, gearing up to be self-sufficient, moving out of the cities, which I think is advisable for those that can, to face what's coming, you may not even have time.
[01:02:04.195 --> 01:02:12.361]  This is something you can have now that you know is a backup, lasts more than 10 years in climate control, 10 years in non-climate control.

[01:02:18.045 --> 01:02:21.827]  Again, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:02:21.847 --> 01:02:24.609]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:28.952]  Okay, Alan Watt, you want to continue with Carbon Footprint.
[01:02:30.353 --> 01:02:33.596]  Finishing what you were trying to say before we got cut off by break.
[01:02:34.017 --> 01:02:35.438]  And then the chemtrails overall.
[01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:39.382]  I'm looking at satellite photos on the major weather sites.
[01:02:39.442 --> 01:02:40.943]  I'm looking at the whole world now.
[01:02:41.504 --> 01:02:44.347]  And I've gone back, because they have archives, as you know, but the listeners may not.
[01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:48.796]  of the skies five, ten, fifteen years ago, it wasn't there.
[01:02:49.277 --> 01:02:58.603]  Now, not just the major cities, like five years ago, but all over the U.S., all over Europe, all over Australia, but even some in third world countries, but it's mainly in the West.
[01:03:00.024 --> 01:03:01.725]  It's just covered with the trails.
[01:03:02.225 --> 01:03:04.246]  They're now at a couple thousand feet in Austin.
[01:03:04.326 --> 01:03:05.907]  They stay there for hour after hour.
[01:03:06.428 --> 01:03:07.468]  Everybody's getting sick.
[01:03:07.568 --> 01:03:13.912]  Major news media has been testing it and finding barium salts, weird fibers,
[01:03:15.394 --> 01:03:17.296]  Aluminum oxide, all of this.
[01:03:17.597 --> 01:03:19.399]  So I'd like you to speak to the chemtrails as well.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:20.760]  Yes.
[01:03:21.642 --> 01:03:26.668]  Back to the footprints, the carbon ones, they're adding taxes on to air flights now too.
[01:03:27.729 --> 01:03:31.153]  Because the future you see, they're going to ban basically tourism.
[01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:33.196]  That will be no longer necessary.
[01:03:34.248 --> 01:03:40.155]  You won't be able to travel to any country without being required for business or work related.
[01:03:40.295 --> 01:03:42.017]  That's the system they're bringing in.
[01:03:42.157 --> 01:03:45.681]  And that'll all be selectively enforced when you go travel places you see.
[01:03:46.001 --> 01:03:46.642]  I'll never forget that.
[01:03:46.662 --> 01:03:47.383]  I'm gonna let you continue.
[01:03:47.403 --> 01:03:48.184]  We just bring up points.
[01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:51.347]  About 15 years ago before I was even on air.
[01:03:52.449 --> 01:04:08.819]  I was out at Hamilton Pool, the cenote, this caved in underground cave, you know, beautiful, looks like something out of Tarzan, deep water, big snapping turtles and fish, and I was playing hooky from college and I was there with a girlfriend laying out on the pebbles, you know, on a summer day and
[01:04:09.659 --> 01:04:16.063]  These Nature Conservancy people showed up and they were making eugenics comments and going, I can't believe they allow people even here.
[01:04:16.404 --> 01:04:18.365]  I can't believe they even allow humans here.
[01:04:18.385 --> 01:04:20.846]  And they were just looking at us with anger.
[01:04:21.227 --> 01:04:27.171]  And then suddenly you saw the park rangers acting like that and this whole culture that we've got to be controlled and herded into cities.
[01:04:28.111 --> 01:04:35.816]  So I just wanted to add that point that we're not even under the official UN plans going to be allowed in more than half of the United States on their maps alone.
[01:04:36.077 --> 01:04:37.418]  You will be shot if you enter it.
[01:04:37.638 --> 01:04:38.618]  And people didn't believe me.
[01:04:38.718 --> 01:04:39.079]  And then
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:46.049]  In 1999, I'll never forget, I don't remember the exact issue, I showed it on my local TV show many times and covered it on air for like a month.
[01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:49.194]  It was talking about an area in Asia.
[01:04:49.841 --> 01:05:09.369]  I want to say Burma and it said huge national international biosphere UN World Heritage sites hundreds of thousands of acres were off-limits and it showed soldiers with M-16s and it said if the locals try to enter to even get water or even get fire water and they are shot and so that models already going go ahead.
[01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:17.252]  That's true and getting back to the housing they will be coming around the houses and testing it for leakage
[01:05:18.072 --> 01:05:26.762]  Because if you can't heat your house efficiently and contain the heat and use barely no fuel, etc., they're basically only going to kick you out of that home.
[01:05:26.902 --> 01:05:32.208]  Banning fireplaces, banning space heaters already in Europe, moving to do that in Canada, it just goes on and on.
[01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:34.110]  Yeah, so that's the whole agenda.
[01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:38.475]  So through the force of law and using the power of the purse, as I call it,
[01:05:39.293 --> 01:05:41.074]  They would force this whole agenda through.
[01:05:41.094 --> 01:05:49.317]  Cars, airplanes, farms, ranches, space heaters, homes, food, every facet micromanaged in text.
[01:05:49.797 --> 01:05:50.857]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:05:51.237 --> 01:05:52.078]  That's the big stick.
[01:05:52.258 --> 01:05:58.960]  And people who have been trained from birth, they always go along with laws, always go along with laws, and don't question it.
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.721]  Everyone else goes along with the laws, so why can't you?
[01:06:01.761 --> 01:06:03.662]  That's what they say to you if you object.
[01:06:03.988 --> 01:06:05.228]  Well, take the Animal ID.
[01:06:05.648 --> 01:06:06.709]  Take the Animal ID.
[01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.889]  I mean, it's just so incredible.
[01:06:09.169 --> 01:06:10.709]  They just mail them around to people.
[01:06:10.769 --> 01:06:12.890]  It wasn't even a law, except in two states, federal.
[01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:15.370]  And they just say, fill out this contract and sign it.
[01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:20.631]  And they sign away their farm and ranch, and now they're finding out they just gave the government an easement and control.
[01:06:21.152 --> 01:06:21.692]  That's correct.
[01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:26.373]  So, what we're up against here is such incredible organization.
[01:06:26.453 --> 01:06:30.513]  That's what really hits anyone who goes into this field of study and research.
[01:06:31.194 --> 01:06:32.974]  The incredible organization
[01:06:33.898 --> 01:06:39.703]  That's micromanaged right down to the lowest level on every particular area or facet of living.
[01:06:40.704 --> 01:06:50.192]  That's what strikes you as overwhelming and it isn't until you realize this has been on the go for such a long time that explains why they're all interconnected.
[01:06:50.652 --> 01:06:58.419]  When Margaret Thatcher left as the Prime Minister of Britain, she said that she now belonged to the parallel government.
[01:06:58.479 --> 01:06:59.960]  She called it the parallel government of
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:04.910]  It's made up of ex-prime ministers, presidents and high officials of all countries.
[01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:06.754]  She says we really run the show.
[01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:15.927]  And I just noticed today that Tony Blair and Merkel is over there with Sarkozy talking about this new economic system they're bringing in.
[01:07:16.147 --> 01:07:25.135]  So Tony Blair, even though he's an ex-Prime Minister, is doing more behind the scenes than he could possibly do when he was the front man as the Prime Minister.
[01:07:25.516 --> 01:07:27.077]  He belongs to the parallel government.
[01:07:27.097 --> 01:07:30.300]  He's now graduated to the real government.
[01:07:30.601 --> 01:07:30.781]  Yes.
[01:07:31.101 --> 01:07:36.363]  Which itself takes orders, while the public's focused on the front dummy puppets.
[01:07:36.683 --> 01:07:40.044]  And I meant to get to that story, it's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:07:40.404 --> 01:07:48.726]  They're saying a new capitalism, with what you said 30 minutes ago, where the government pays all the corporations, who in turn pay the people, total control.
[01:07:49.187 --> 01:07:49.687]  That's correct.
[01:07:49.707 --> 01:07:53.648]  So therefore government will achieve the objective it was set up to do a long time ago.
[01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:55.232]  Finland's been doing that!
[01:08:10.009 --> 01:08:17.555]  And Finland's been doing that for 16, 17 years, where your parking ticket is according to how much money you have, and if you're wealthier they take more.
[01:08:17.595 --> 01:08:19.717]  It's a class thing they did to sell the public.
[01:08:20.117 --> 01:08:30.565]  But now it's for carbon footprint, and everything you buy and sell is tracked, and they compare that, and they say it's the world model according to how much money you make, so they can tell if you're not paying taxes or have a black market job.
[01:08:31.025 --> 01:08:31.486]  That's correct.
[01:08:32.416 --> 01:08:45.645]  They're making refrigerators now that will read every item that's put in that fridge and literally it can get in touch with the supermarket to reorder but it can also obviously get in touch with the government and let them know everything you have.
[01:08:45.925 --> 01:08:46.065]  Oh!
[01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:46.826]  Oh, a Masada?
[01:08:47.786 --> 01:08:54.989]  They will know if all that you have, good-wise, comes from your ration, your quota.
[01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:57.489]  And if you're above that, they'll want to know where you got it from.
[01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:03.432]  Yes, it reads the RFID, and by law they're trying to make it where all refrigerators will have this within five years.
[01:09:03.832 --> 01:09:07.213]  And then now this big Masonic Hospital organization, I saw the story two weeks ago,
[01:09:07.813 --> 01:09:16.058]  Where the old people, if they aren't eating enough food or it's scanning their food, they go ahead and come and, you know, take them away to be put in a home or hospice.
[01:09:16.499 --> 01:09:24.764]  And then they're also going to track, with the school lunch program where you swipe your card, they're already CPS-ing children, because even if they bring their own lunch, it has to be entered in.
[01:09:24.784 --> 01:09:27.886]  And then they say, you weren't feeding your child healthy food, we're taking them.
[01:09:28.874 --> 01:09:29.315]  That's right.
[01:09:30.055 --> 01:09:38.544]  And getting back to this parallel government, I mean, Professor Carl Quigley talked about this in his book Tragedy and Hope and the Anglo-American Establishment, two books.
[01:09:39.445 --> 01:09:42.928]  He said that the parallel government runs with technocrats.
[01:09:43.068 --> 01:09:46.532]  Blair now is a technocrat like Brzezinski or Maurice Strong.
[01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:47.850]  Or Kissinger.
[01:09:48.471 --> 01:10:00.995]  And he said that the prime ministers and presidents can take the heat for the policies of government, he says, but the real work is done behind the scenes with technocrats who are not responsible to the public, they're not elected by the public.
[01:10:01.175 --> 01:10:06.818]  His whole life, Blair's whole life, Clinton's whole life, they finally graduate into real government.
[01:10:07.538 --> 01:10:07.698]  Yes.
[01:10:09.053 --> 01:10:15.678]  And we're seeing it now, and why is the media even so concentrated on ex-prime ministers and ex-presidents?
[01:10:17.199 --> 01:10:33.332]  It's out in the open now that they are a part of this important parallel government, this interlinked, interwoven completely with all of the big foundations that all work in concert, they're all on the same agenda, and they even have foundations which go out to make sure there's consensus.
[01:10:33.932 --> 01:10:41.495]  Building within every organization, so they're all on board on track with the same politically correct agendas.
[01:10:42.816 --> 01:10:44.477]  Simply stunning, Alan Watt.
[01:10:44.517 --> 01:10:46.617]  Briefly, chemtrails, they seem to be intensifying.
[01:10:47.418 --> 01:10:48.498]  They are intensifying.
[01:10:50.419 --> 01:10:57.422]  I noticed it in Ontario when they really started hitting us ten years ago exactly, in fact it was.
[01:10:58.328 --> 01:10:58.588]  I don't know.
[01:11:20.259 --> 01:11:27.385]  It's only now they're saying we're thinking of seeding the air with chemicals to curb global warming.
[01:11:27.746 --> 01:11:32.030]  Well, they've been doing something for 10 years, and I don't think it's got anything to do with global warming.
[01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:40.337]  In fact, those who watch this notice that when they heavily spray an area, it heats up underneath because the tiny refractors in the metals act like mirrors.
[01:11:40.657 --> 01:11:41.598]  No, they're trying to heat.
[01:11:41.618 --> 01:11:42.399]  They're trying to heat.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:48.283]  Because I think they knew the sun was about to cool off, and I'm not saying they're good, but they actually need to heat the earth.
[01:11:48.643 --> 01:11:49.884]  Then they're trying to restrict carbon.
[01:11:50.864 --> 01:11:53.306]  Alan Watt, let's finish up with Kim Trails, then go right to calls.
[01:11:53.406 --> 01:11:57.909]  Michael, Joe, Bill, Mark, Michelle, Michael, Danny, and others, stay with us.
[01:11:58.049 --> 01:11:58.730]  We'll be right back.
[01:12:02.892 --> 01:12:09.857]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero, and we knew what to do.
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:11.661]  At least we thought we did.
[01:12:11.902 --> 01:12:18.331]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:12:18.931 --> 01:12:27.463]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:12:27.847 --> 01:12:34.650]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:38.011]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:12:38.111 --> 01:12:43.333]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:12:43.874 --> 01:12:46.515]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:12:46.955 --> 01:12:53.938]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:06.331]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:13:06.731 --> 01:13:12.174]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:13:12.634 --> 01:13:13.695]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:13:13.735 --> 01:13:17.777]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:13:18.437 --> 01:13:31.748]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:13:32.248 --> 01:13:37.553]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:13:37.853 --> 01:13:43.738]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:13:44.488 --> 01:13:45.709]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:45.749 --> 01:13:47.450]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:47.810]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.851]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:13:49.871 --> 01:13:49.931]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:01.991 --> 01:14:07.694]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-C.
[01:14:07.854 --> 01:14:17.719]  The original Can-C eyedrop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing and slowing the occurrence of senile cataracts.
[01:14:17.839 --> 01:14:22.205]  CanSee can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[01:14:22.325 --> 01:14:29.294]  CanSee is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders, combat eye strain, can ease computer vision syndrome, and more.
[01:14:29.414 --> 01:14:35.162]  People enjoying the benefits while using CanSee report no side effects and the drops are gentle and don't cause eye burning.
[01:14:35.282 --> 01:14:35.983]  We're good to go!
[01:15:03.871 --> 01:15:09.177]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[01:15:09.637 --> 01:15:11.379]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[01:15:11.919 --> 01:15:13.401]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:17.625]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:21.550]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:26.675]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of
[01:15:32.062 --> 01:15:32.302]  That's a
[01:16:06.155 --> 01:16:13.620]  I don't know how anybody out there watching couldn't visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com five, six times a day and spread the word.
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.041]  I mean, the story's here.
[01:16:15.141 --> 01:16:18.263]  Obama's energy czar, socialist agent for a new world order.
[01:16:18.583 --> 01:16:21.686]  Air Force creates counter-blog response to plan...
[01:16:22.586 --> 01:16:28.293]  ...and quell dissent inside the United States, openly targeting propaganda against the American people.
[01:16:28.574 --> 01:16:32.899]  The Marines announced publicly yesterday, yes, we're going to fight the American people.
[01:16:32.979 --> 01:16:40.829]  I didn't even cover that article, where they're announcing they're going to engage in combat in America, not even against Al-Qaeda, which they claim the American people.
[01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:45.251]  It is just unbelievable, the type of things.
[01:16:45.631 --> 01:16:51.092]  And things are going so fast now, Alan, you and I can hardly even respond to all of it.
[01:16:51.172 --> 01:16:57.854]  And everything we said is happening because we were just reading the Globalist's own documents before they were widely disseminated.
[01:16:57.874 --> 01:17:01.095]  Yes, that's the whole trick of it.
[01:17:01.315 --> 01:17:06.816]  The public have been, unfortunately, well-trained with scientific indoctrination.
[01:17:07.324 --> 01:17:10.265]  The television is not something to be entertained with.
[01:17:10.525 --> 01:17:12.305]  It's the greatest tool the elite have ever had.
[01:17:13.086 --> 01:17:25.309]  You can't listen to truth and think about the truth and dissect it for yourself and switch on the TV and get lost for an hour on some other topic because whatever you're learning is going to be eradicated from your mind.
[01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:27.796]  It is a scientific tool.
[01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:30.578]  It's been put to an incredible effect.
[01:17:31.059 --> 01:17:39.826]  But they're also going into the ELF warfare techniques now that Brzezinski talked about in his book Between Two Ages.
[01:17:40.646 --> 01:17:50.654]  He mentioned the technotronic era in that book, and the technotronic era was a technique that would be used on the general population.
[01:17:50.934 --> 01:17:51.815]  He meant worldwide.
[01:17:53.792 --> 01:17:57.957]  They get their opinions and ideas coming to them, but they have no idea where it was coming from.
[01:17:57.977 --> 01:18:01.040]  And he was talking about really ELF technology.
[01:18:01.701 --> 01:18:05.184]  And they are putting up antennas in some of the big cities.
[01:18:05.225 --> 01:18:09.709]  I've got photographs here, some of them in the process of being built, in fact.
[01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:14.735]  And they have their own transponders down below.
[01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:24.399]  And these things are unlike the ones they use for cell phones, and I think this is all part of the network to control the minds of the public.
[01:18:24.739 --> 01:18:26.640]  Now, this stuff is well proven.
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:27.641]  It works very well.
[01:18:28.081 --> 01:18:33.184]  It can put you into a state of apathy or aggression or depression.
[01:18:35.768 --> 01:18:48.220]  By the way, a mainstream publication two weeks ago came out, and it's been in the Baltimore Sun as well, and said DARPA has these ultrasound alone can calm you or make you angry, and they said we're going to start doing this for the public.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.001]  That's right.
[01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:52.764]  We're just going to put towers up, but it's to fight Al-Qaeda, Alan.
[01:18:53.725 --> 01:18:57.289]  Yes, they're actually going ahead and building them and putting them up.
[01:18:58.032 --> 01:19:01.833]  In preparedness for the times ahead.
[01:19:01.893 --> 01:19:06.515]  Well, Alan, what are we going to do when a cop shoots an unarmed man in the back on the ground?
[01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:09.236]  We've got to turn these on and calm everybody down, Alan.
[01:19:09.716 --> 01:19:11.577]  Yes, that's the whole thing.
[01:19:11.837 --> 01:19:17.199]  You see, again, it goes back to this whole idea that we're just animals and there's nothing spiritual about you.
[01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:18.839]  You have no soul, no nothing.
[01:19:18.859 --> 01:19:20.940]  You're just a contained brain.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.021]  And they call it endless loops inside your own brain.
[01:19:24.061 --> 01:19:25.662]  That's what they teach in university.
[01:19:25.942 --> 01:19:27.363]  And they also give us double-think.
[01:19:27.383 --> 01:19:30.944]  They go, well, all these people die when they get tasered, but that's just a syndrome.
[01:19:31.425 --> 01:19:33.505]  People just happen to die at the same time they're tasered.
[01:19:33.525 --> 01:19:34.226]  It's not the taser.
[01:19:34.586 --> 01:19:39.548]  Now they might say... Some people are allergic to it, you see.
[01:19:39.768 --> 01:19:42.109]  Well, now when we shoot you, maybe it's a syndrome.
[01:19:42.129 --> 01:19:43.210]  Maybe the bullet didn't do it.
[01:19:43.991 --> 01:19:44.391]  That's it.
[01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:44.872]  That's right.
[01:19:45.452 --> 01:19:47.415]  And so they can rationalize, and they are.
[01:19:47.435 --> 01:19:55.385]  They're using every kind of rationalization, almost mockingly today, to justify what they can do because they're given all power.
[01:19:55.445 --> 01:19:57.548]  They know they have all power to do as they wish.
[01:19:58.157 --> 01:20:04.419]  They've raised a generation that's willing to use all of this technology and weaponry on the public.
[01:20:04.819 --> 01:20:06.779]  They've been brought up playing the video games.
[01:20:07.179 --> 01:20:08.680]  There's no morality in a video game.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.040]  It's get to the other side and kill the other.
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:14.361]  And they condition us with all the violence they constantly show on TV to accept it.
[01:20:14.381 --> 01:20:15.602]  This segment's almost over.
[01:20:15.622 --> 01:20:16.962]  I want to come back and go directly to calls.
[01:20:17.282 --> 01:20:20.163]  You got cut off on the last segment with the Chemtrail comments.
[01:20:20.203 --> 01:20:20.583]  Go ahead.
[01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:27.525]  Yes, the Chemtrails, I'll tell you, it probably has many, many different functions, I'm sure.
[01:20:28.554 --> 01:20:31.115]  It definitely makes people apathetic and tired.
[01:20:31.496 --> 01:20:32.496]  That's been well noted.
[01:20:33.016 --> 01:20:38.879]  And I get, I've been watching this for years and talking to hundreds of people over the years on it, but they're heavily sprayed.
[01:20:39.728 --> 01:20:48.034]  And as you say, the fallout, the physical fallouts, even in the bronchial tubes and the long-lasting infections, etc., are well noted.
[01:20:48.135 --> 01:20:51.917]  Every pharmacist in the country knows what his best-selling products are.
[01:20:52.198 --> 01:21:03.346]  Go in and ask the pharmacist and he'll tell you it's the bronchodilators and expectorants and so on, and antibiotics that are really being pushed for the last 10 years to do with this spraying.
[01:21:03.506 --> 01:21:05.568]  He might not mention the spraying, he might not know himself,
[01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:07.756]  But he knows what he sells off the shelves.
[01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:13.780]  And so the ones at the top who advocated this, they treat us like children.
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:14.720]  They call us children.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.961]  You cannot tell the children what we're doing to them.
[01:21:17.021 --> 01:21:18.102]  It's for their own benefit.
[01:21:18.142 --> 01:21:18.782]  Poor souls.
[01:21:19.123 --> 01:21:20.243]  But we don't want to scare them.
[01:21:20.523 --> 01:21:28.068]  They know, probably right down to the smallest iota, how many people will die off with this, with respiratory problems.
[01:21:30.202 --> 01:21:31.763]  And then we call it allergies.
[01:21:31.783 --> 01:21:33.524]  People who never had them suddenly can't breathe.
[01:21:33.544 --> 01:21:34.585]  They're sick all the time.
[01:21:34.985 --> 01:21:41.169]  Suddenly, I saw a report last year that women's lung cancer is up seven times what it was a decade ago.
[01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:42.770]  And they go, that's all right.
[01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:46.772]  We'll have a little cancer group for you and make you feel like you're a little movie star.
[01:21:47.072 --> 01:21:48.914]  Now you're going to die and go in a coffin.
[01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:49.874]  Bye bye.
[01:21:50.174 --> 01:21:51.035]  We love you.
[01:21:51.055 --> 01:21:51.995]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:52.536 --> 01:21:53.436]  We're on the march.
[01:21:53.937 --> 01:21:55.518]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:55.538 --> 01:21:59.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:02.802 --> 01:22:03.982]  The headlines are clear.
[01:22:04.623 --> 01:22:07.063]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:22:07.524 --> 01:22:10.085]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:22:10.745 --> 01:22:12.405]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:22:12.485 --> 01:22:15.646]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:22:15.787 --> 01:22:18.367]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[01:22:18.547 --> 01:22:19.428]  To stay free.
[01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:24.111]  Now, Survivalist Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[01:22:24.131 --> 01:22:27.453]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[01:22:27.493 --> 01:22:30.215]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[01:22:30.355 --> 01:22:34.978]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[01:22:34.998 --> 01:22:38.080]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:44.064]  Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money.
[01:22:44.184 --> 01:22:47.146]  Selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[01:22:47.306 --> 01:22:48.767]  Restaurants and small delis.
[01:22:48.787 --> 01:22:50.028]  Don't buy from copycats.
[01:22:50.188 --> 01:22:52.050]  Their fancy packaging is not free.
[01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:54.192]  Order today before it's too late.
[01:22:54.272 --> 01:22:56.093]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:22:56.133 --> 01:22:58.295]  That's SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:22:58.496 --> 01:23:00.497]  A long-term food solution.
[01:23:02.259 --> 01:23:08.645]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:23:09.005 --> 01:23:10.707]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:11.641 --> 01:23:12.662]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:13.182 --> 01:23:13.703]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:13.983 --> 01:23:14.964]  This is his M.O.
[01:23:14.984 --> 01:23:16.285]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:18.007]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:18.347 --> 01:23:25.113]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:25.493 --> 01:23:25.934]  Some U.S.
[01:23:25.974 --> 01:23:31.619]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:32.319 --> 01:23:35.841]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:36.201 --> 01:23:46.067]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:23:46.307 --> 01:23:47.048]  Fabled enemies.
[01:23:47.528 --> 01:23:54.792]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:55.293 --> 01:23:58.635]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:02.074 --> 01:24:06.917]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system new from HempUSA.org.
[01:24:07.117 --> 01:24:15.523]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[01:24:15.743 --> 01:24:20.426]  Imagine a softer smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[01:24:20.666 --> 01:24:27.471]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[01:24:27.711 --> 01:24:33.936]  This water system will descale all piping, hot water heaters, and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[01:24:34.096 --> 01:24:44.965]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins, with extreme positive effects on plants, vegetables, and fruits.
[01:24:45.025 --> 01:24:49.909]  Improved taste, color, size, and yield with approximately 30% less water usage.
[01:24:50.049 --> 01:24:53.572]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[01:24:53.812 --> 01:24:57.294]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:24:57.394 --> 01:25:00.136]  That's 908-691-2608.
[01:25:00.236 --> 01:25:08.581]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:25:09.281 --> 01:25:11.583]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:25:25.532 --> 01:25:26.312]  All right, Alan.
[01:25:26.792 --> 01:25:28.773]  CutIntoTheMatrix.com is his website.
[01:25:28.813 --> 01:25:33.435]  Be sure and check out the audios, the materials, the videos, things that are available there.
[01:25:33.475 --> 01:25:35.956]  Be sure and support Alan Watt and the work he's doing.
[01:25:35.976 --> 01:25:40.837]  Be sure and support our work as well and all the documentary films that I have made.
[01:25:40.877 --> 01:25:42.658]  I've made 20 of them and produced another.
[01:25:43.058 --> 01:25:45.079]  Actually produced two, Fabled Enemies and Loose Change.
[01:25:45.499 --> 01:25:46.019]  Final Cut.
[01:25:46.039 --> 01:25:50.300]  Fabled Enemies is the latest 9-11 film and we learn more as time goes on.
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:54.562]  This is an open and shut case about how the establishment carried out the attacks.
[01:25:55.222 --> 01:25:59.667]  The Money Masters, How the Bankers Got Total Control, three and a half hour film, 1995.
[01:26:01.869 --> 01:26:05.233]  Really the Rosetta Stone of understanding the overall in-game agenda.
[01:26:05.253 --> 01:26:10.819]  If I had to say see one film to understand their total agenda and their program, it's it.
[01:26:11.419 --> 01:26:13.482]  This film, In-Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:26:14.582 --> 01:26:16.403]  The 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising.
[01:26:16.883 --> 01:26:18.903]  I mean, this is the latest film I made.
[01:26:19.624 --> 01:26:21.544]  And I just can't even describe the film.
[01:26:21.564 --> 01:26:22.324]  You've got to see it.
[01:26:23.765 --> 01:26:24.625]  It's cinema verite.
[01:26:24.665 --> 01:26:25.625]  It's fast-paced.
[01:26:25.645 --> 01:26:29.827]  30, 40 world leaders confronted.
[01:26:30.387 --> 01:26:31.807]  Willie Nelson interviewed.
[01:26:34.368 --> 01:26:35.708]  Martin Sheen interviewed.
[01:26:35.728 --> 01:26:36.769]  George
[01:26:38.857 --> 01:26:39.818]  Carlin interviewed.
[01:26:40.659 --> 01:26:44.982]  I mean the list just goes on and on to try to describe everything that is in this film.
[01:26:45.002 --> 01:26:49.326]  Bill Clinton confronted, David Rockefeller confronted, John McCain, Barack Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:26:50.046 --> 01:26:51.147]  Just an incredible film.
[01:26:51.247 --> 01:26:54.970]  The 9-11 Chronicles folks need to have this documentary.
[01:26:55.871 --> 01:27:02.817]  Again, available at InfoWars.com and Alan's stuff is all available at CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[01:27:03.277 --> 01:27:06.340]  I want to go to your calls now for those that have been patiently holding to the balance
[01:27:07.612 --> 01:27:11.054]  of this Friday edition and try to move quickly through them.
[01:27:11.074 --> 01:27:12.955]  I appreciate everybody being patient.
[01:27:13.536 --> 01:27:15.657]  Let's talk to Michael in Chicago.
[01:27:15.677 --> 01:27:16.858]  You're on the air with Alan Watt.
[01:27:19.619 --> 01:27:21.120]  Michelle, excuse me, I read that wrong.
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.121]  Michelle in Chicago, go ahead.
[01:27:23.802 --> 01:27:25.083]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:27:25.403 --> 01:27:25.663]  Good.
[01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:27.464]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:27:27.484 --> 01:27:33.828]  I probably woke up maybe about two years ago, started watching the 9-11 films and
[01:27:35.042 --> 01:28:02.545]  I was a big watcher of TV before and now that I'm seeing it after waking up to everything that's going on, it's so obvious, the brainwashing that these people are broadcasting to everybody and it's just so disheartening to watch it happen and listen to them mock truthers as conspiracy theorists and just dismiss everything that they're saying and
[01:28:04.184 --> 01:28:13.202]  Make it into a big joke and it's such a ridiculous thing that people, the media is so ridiculous that people just don't pay attention to it.
[01:28:13.963 --> 01:28:16.385]  And they're apathetic, and they just don't care.
[01:28:16.425 --> 01:28:18.187]  But that's what they mean.
[01:28:18.267 --> 01:28:24.051]  At a certain level of programming, that's why they came out and said that the number two in Al-Qaeda had been killed 14 separate times.
[01:28:24.191 --> 01:28:25.252]  Oh my God!
[01:28:25.272 --> 01:28:26.793]  They don't pay attention!
[01:28:26.974 --> 01:28:28.435]  And then never retracted.
[01:28:28.455 --> 01:28:28.495]  No!
[01:28:28.975 --> 01:28:31.877]  Okay, last time we didn't really kill him, but this time we did.
[01:28:32.338 --> 01:28:33.579]  People don't even care.
[01:28:33.599 --> 01:28:35.781]  They don't even remember what happened two years ago.
[01:28:35.801 --> 01:28:39.003]  All they care about is the current stats that are going on right now.
[01:28:39.043 --> 01:28:41.265]  All these election things, they don't talk about the issues.
[01:28:41.645 --> 01:28:42.846]  They talk about the numbers.
[01:28:43.146 --> 01:28:45.288]  But the point I was... Yes, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:28:45.468 --> 01:28:45.928]  No, no, no.
[01:28:45.968 --> 01:28:47.389]  I'm just... I want to get Alan's take on this.
[01:28:48.670 --> 01:28:49.751]  I've just noticed they do this.
[01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:58.857]  They're making the propaganda ridiculous to make people almost tune out and then just disregard all information where it's all just kind of a background noise.
[01:28:59.337 --> 01:29:00.958]  Alan, what do you call that tactic?
[01:29:02.259 --> 01:29:04.621]  It's... it works with dystopia, they call it.
[01:29:05.396 --> 01:29:05.596]  Thank you.
[01:29:22.987 --> 01:29:35.054]  Yeah, they did that with rats and then hired primates and I had a marine call in, I was familiar with a study where they take a puppy and shock it on a plate and it's got its food, every time it goes to the food it shocks it and finally it just rolls over and waits to die.
[01:29:35.514 --> 01:29:43.319]  Yeah, so whenever it mentions the same topic again, you'll just automatically say, well you're paranoid, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:29:43.979 --> 01:29:48.182]  And abelia is a main one too, it's just no memory, people have no memory.
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:50.401]  And they think in bits and bytes.
[01:29:50.421 --> 01:29:52.683]  Little clips on the media come in short bursts now.
[01:29:53.003 --> 01:29:54.805]  And that's the attention span of most people.
[01:29:54.825 --> 01:29:55.766]  They can't concentrate.
[01:29:55.846 --> 01:29:57.167]  They produced it by design.
[01:29:57.207 --> 01:29:58.248]  Anything else, Michelle?
[01:29:59.389 --> 01:30:02.131]  Um, well, I just wanted to say thank you, Alex.
[01:30:02.791 --> 01:30:06.054]  You've got... You're very brave, to say the least.
[01:30:07.634 --> 01:30:09.775]  Listen, this is not a figure of speech, Michelle.
[01:30:09.815 --> 01:30:11.797]  I'm not, oh, I'm not brave now, ma'am.
[01:30:11.837 --> 01:30:12.697]  I'm just doing my job.
[01:30:13.258 --> 01:30:14.439]  Literally, I'm not brave.
[01:30:14.519 --> 01:30:22.885]  How would I not discover a scientific technocracy that is completely psychopathic and enjoys destroying my species and my children's future?
[01:30:23.245 --> 01:30:30.070]  How would I not aggressively fight it with everything I've got and try to build some media system to at least counter it?
[01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:30.870]  I mean, how would I?
[01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:36.074]  I would be mindlessly brave if I knew this and just said, forget it.
[01:30:36.474 --> 01:30:37.514]  Alan, can you speak to that?
[01:30:38.675 --> 01:30:39.155]  It's true.
[01:30:39.175 --> 01:30:44.157]  I mean, every animal on the planet, even insects, will try and defend themselves.
[01:30:44.797 --> 01:30:50.178]  A mouse will actually scratch the nose of a cat, rather than just get eaten, or to save his young.
[01:30:50.759 --> 01:30:56.020]  And we have the same abilities here, only we've been so dumbed down and made to be apathetic.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:01.222]  This is, again, a scientific technique of indoctrination, of abeyance to authority.
[01:31:01.849 --> 01:31:07.012]  That we allow them to take the next step and the next step to our own extinction.
[01:31:07.372 --> 01:31:09.073]  And we can't allow that to happen.
[01:31:09.393 --> 01:31:10.574]  We can't allow it to happen.
[01:31:10.614 --> 01:31:15.616]  We have the right to exist on this planet as much as anyone who believes he's an elitist does.
[01:31:16.277 --> 01:31:19.278]  And they're no more valued than we are.
[01:31:19.799 --> 01:31:20.399]  That's a fact.
[01:31:20.879 --> 01:31:22.820]  And I appreciate your call, Michel.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:23.861]  I'd love to keep you on longer.
[01:31:23.881 --> 01:31:24.741]  I love all these callers.
[01:31:24.761 --> 01:31:26.402]  We've got to get to everybody who at least is holding.
[01:31:28.323 --> 01:31:33.067]  I mean, that is the basic facts of this, what Alan just said.
[01:31:34.007 --> 01:31:38.131]  And they have taught us to not have our survival instinct or to turn it on and off.
[01:31:38.171 --> 01:31:41.153]  When they say turn it off, it's not okay to stand up and fight back.
[01:31:41.553 --> 01:31:42.814]  Like in England where they arrest you.
[01:31:42.834 --> 01:31:46.237]  If somebody's raping your wife and you punch them, you go to jail, the rapist doesn't.
[01:31:46.437 --> 01:31:47.097]  That's on record.
[01:31:47.117 --> 01:31:52.121]  Or if somebody's robbed you three times, they come in to kill you, you stab them, you go to jail.
[01:31:52.141 --> 01:31:55.144]  Or if you push somebody out a window and they're attacking you, you go to jail.
[01:31:55.184 --> 01:31:56.485]  They're saying you are not
[01:31:57.591 --> 01:32:01.577]  To protect yourself because it's a criminal class running things they want.
[01:32:01.597 --> 01:32:12.313]  I mean, it's kind of like when some really expensive snakes, they amputate the guinea pig's legs and defang it and take its teeth out so it can't bite the snake.
[01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:20.700]  When the snake eats it because they don't want the snake to be hurt, or they'll drug the guinea pig with a drug that doesn't affect the snake, so the guinea pig doesn't hurt it.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:23.382]  We've been neutralized to be like a guinea pig.
[01:32:23.422 --> 01:32:30.928]  It's had its eyes gouged out, its teeth pulled out, its legs cut off, dropped into the snake, and that's what this social Darwinism is.
[01:32:31.748 --> 01:32:34.509]  And that's what carbon taxing is, teaching us we're bad.
[01:32:34.769 --> 01:32:39.692]  They take our own survival instinct and say, if the Earth's going to survive, we've got to kill ourselves.
[01:32:39.932 --> 01:32:42.093]  They're teaching us our own survival system.
[01:32:42.593 --> 01:32:45.654]  Our own survival propulsion system is a thought crime.
[01:32:46.955 --> 01:32:54.118]  They are, and I was reading an article recently from the United Nations about the idea of power and total power.
[01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:57.212]  And they call that the power monopoly of force.
[01:33:22.691 --> 01:33:22.831]  Yeah.
[01:33:23.191 --> 01:33:29.694]  That's in a UNIDIR document, July 7, 2001, where they say that's why the American people must be armed.
[01:33:30.034 --> 01:33:32.255]  And the bill has been introduced by the Democrats.
[01:33:32.535 --> 01:33:40.239]  Barack Obama, if they pass it, is set to sign it, where the Attorney General can ban any and all guns simply by uttering the word, ex cathedra.
[01:33:41.199 --> 01:33:42.761]  Uh, literally as God-Emperor.
[01:33:42.841 --> 01:33:43.902]  I mean, this, you can't make it up.
[01:33:43.942 --> 01:33:49.466]  It's up on InfoWars.com, now in the News & Focus Archive, uh, or Featured Story Archive.
[01:33:49.867 --> 01:33:51.268]  Let's go to another caller here.
[01:33:51.688 --> 01:33:52.609]  This isn't a drill, folks.
[01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:53.269]  This is for real.
[01:33:53.309 --> 01:33:53.910]  This is happening.
[01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:56.672]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk Joe Hung Up.
[01:33:56.752 --> 01:33:58.434]  Bill in Illinois, and then others.
[01:33:58.514 --> 01:34:00.375]  Bill, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[01:34:01.756 --> 01:34:02.437]  Hi, gentlemen.
[01:34:02.657 --> 01:34:06.140]  Uh, I was hoping that we could just roll into the weekend and give people some hope.
[01:34:07.791 --> 01:34:20.621]  I know that all the information that comes out is really paralyzing and scary to most people, but the more you dive into it and see what's going on and try to wake people up and knock them out of their comas.
[01:34:21.002 --> 01:34:29.989]  I'm seeing a groundswell of people waking up in the Chicagoland area, and everybody is being laid off.
[01:34:30.049 --> 01:34:33.452]  They're trying to figure out how they're going to make rent or put food on the table.
[01:34:33.894 --> 01:34:40.210]  And now's the time when people are paying attention, and now's the time where we can all start to organize and provide solutions and...
[01:34:41.238 --> 01:34:47.281]  Start a blog, or make videos, or pass out your DVDs, and get people to be aware.
[01:34:47.321 --> 01:34:51.123]  Well, I agree, but here's an analogy, and we'll get Alan's comment, and then let you counter-comment.
[01:34:51.663 --> 01:34:54.865]  If someone is taking this information we're giving and is paralyzing, they shouldn't.
[01:34:55.205 --> 01:35:10.072]  The establishment, through chemicals, through the media, through the television, through the culture, because then we pick up the propaganda and regurgitate, then that gives it with the pheromone activation, you know, in the true third dimension, the reality trigger in the mind, but that gets into some more sophisticated issues that I've
[01:35:11.874 --> 01:35:16.542]  We have to understand that it's like they've given us a big shot of a sedative.
[01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.770]  Okay?
[01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:27.951]  And then this show is literally a shot of adrenaline where you're laying on a railroad track, you've been shot up full of Thorazine, you can't get up.
[01:35:28.632 --> 01:35:30.772]  Alan Watt and I are coming in with adrenaline going ERGH!
[01:35:30.792 --> 01:35:34.052]  You know, to where you can actually get up and get off the track.
[01:35:34.453 --> 01:35:38.433]  And so we're just telling you the full truth, folks, so you know what you're facing.
[01:35:39.053 --> 01:35:39.413]  Okay?
[01:35:39.694 --> 01:35:47.555]  Because if people are being paralyzed by this, I mean, I don't know about you in my life, but I mean, Alan, when somebody starts swinging at you, I don't feel paralyzed, I go into gear.
[01:35:48.235 --> 01:35:48.395]  Mm-hmm.
[01:35:48.816 --> 01:35:49.616]  Yeah, you must do.
[01:35:49.696 --> 01:35:59.624]  Again, this is a war, and when you realize it is a war strategy and you're in it, whether you like it or not, then you have to fight back with all that you can do, no matter what it is.
[01:36:00.405 --> 01:36:02.206]  And don't be overwhelmed by it.
[01:36:02.226 --> 01:36:04.208]  This has been on the go before we were born.
[01:36:04.952 --> 01:36:10.553]  And when you realize it's always a long-term system, long-term goals, then you're still in the battle.
[01:36:10.593 --> 01:36:12.433]  It's not over until the fat lady sings.
[01:36:12.453 --> 01:36:14.914]  Yeah, you can't opt out of this.
[01:36:14.954 --> 01:36:15.934]  You can't opt out of this.
[01:36:16.154 --> 01:36:17.134]  You were born into this.
[01:36:17.494 --> 01:36:25.756]  Yes, and what you have to do, too, is realize those things which are paralyzing you, those things which are numbing your brain, like the television, and stop watching it.
[01:36:25.816 --> 01:36:31.797]  Start reading, getting into the factual information that is put out by the authorities themselves.
[01:36:31.837 --> 01:36:32.777]  You can find the stuff.
[01:36:32.797 --> 01:36:33.617]  It's all over the place.
[01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:36.582]  And realize this is all very, very real.
[01:36:36.642 --> 01:36:37.322]  What can I do?
[01:36:37.943 --> 01:36:39.403]  And start doing something.
[01:36:39.483 --> 01:36:46.986]  I started off handwriting stuff and photocopying stuff and sending out to hundreds of people who had a voice when I had none.
[01:36:47.967 --> 01:36:50.728]  And that's the sort of thing that you have to do.
[01:36:50.768 --> 01:36:52.609]  You have no option but to do something.
[01:36:53.309 --> 01:37:00.272]  And you are an active combatant in this system, whether you like it or not, because the elite have declared war upon you.
[01:37:01.308 --> 01:37:02.048]  Well, that's what I do.
[01:37:02.088 --> 01:37:07.770]  I try to bring people that I respect and I think have information that's needed to this large platform, the biggest in alternative media.
[01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:11.630]  And that's why this platform is so precious, folks, and why we need your financial support.
[01:37:11.971 --> 01:37:15.391]  Because we're trying to do, you know, this isn't a very big operation compared to the establishment.
[01:37:15.411 --> 01:37:15.831]  It's tiny.
[01:37:16.152 --> 01:37:19.332]  But compared to the Liberty Movement, this is about as big and as strong as it gets.
[01:37:19.812 --> 01:37:20.973]  And it's very expensive.
[01:37:21.013 --> 01:37:23.113]  And so please buy the books and videos, donate.
[01:37:23.553 --> 01:37:28.014]  I'm glad to see that the auction there is over $45,000 for the bullhorn.
[01:37:28.034 --> 01:37:30.035]  I had no idea it would go that high.
[01:37:30.715 --> 01:37:32.857]  But that is very, very exciting.
[01:37:34.138 --> 01:37:38.361]  And it doesn't close out until next Wednesday night, so we'll see what happens with that.
[01:37:38.681 --> 01:37:41.923]  But sir, go ahead, anything else you wanted to add there briefly, Bill?
[01:37:42.183 --> 01:37:53.571]  I agree with you, now is the time that people are finally, while the new rule is finally emerging, and by the way, Governor Blagojevich has been impeached by the Illinois House, and he faces trial now in the Senate.
[01:37:53.612 --> 01:37:53.952]  Go ahead.
[01:37:55.832 --> 01:38:01.656]  Alex, I was just going to add that, and I've said this before, the old saying of we are the ones we've been waiting for.
[01:38:01.676 --> 01:38:02.617]  I thank you.
[01:38:02.697 --> 01:38:10.342]  You guys actually have posted some of my videos on your site this week, and I encourage people to check out How to Stop the New World Order.
[01:38:10.462 --> 01:38:11.663]  It's Alex and David Icke.
[01:38:12.345 --> 01:38:15.506]  Alex, I want to just mention quickly as a quick aside here to my main body on my call.
[01:38:40.316 --> 01:38:45.338]  Really, if you can, I would urge you to have another money bomb as soon as possible.
[01:38:45.398 --> 01:38:51.600]  I figure you probably got a very limited amount of artifacts there, which would probably all auction very well.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:55.681]  But if that be the case, perhaps that will take the place of a money bomb for a time.
[01:38:55.761 --> 01:39:07.805]  But whatever it takes, Alex, in order for you to be able to do your job unhindered by lack of funds at this point, because they're really up in the ante faster than, well, like you say, sometimes it takes your breath away these days.
[01:39:08.086 --> 01:39:09.166]  They're moving so fast.
[01:39:09.730 --> 01:39:15.734]  And they are pulling everything off the shelf at one time, using it all at one time, in order to overwhelm us at this point.
[01:39:15.874 --> 01:39:18.395]  This is their strategy, I firmly believe that.
[01:39:19.156 --> 01:39:38.788]  But Alan, you know, the ultra elite, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the English royalty and the royalty of the Netherlands, the Vatican, black Jesuit sect, they've been promised by their god, whom they call Lucifer, that they're going to inherit the Earth.
[01:39:40.101 --> 01:39:44.083]  And he has the name of Satan now, and he is the devil.
[01:39:44.924 --> 01:39:51.187]  But they do his bidding in order to get this deal of inheriting the whole Earth eternally.
[01:39:51.807 --> 01:39:59.851]  And of course, the destruction and or aberration of all of God's creation on this planet is the devil's bidding, so we see that.
[01:40:00.591 --> 01:40:05.534]  But they're so under the illusion of Satan, the master of illusion, that they don't realize
[01:40:06.092 --> 01:40:17.357]  That, as the Bible prophesizes, they will fall completely in their efforts, and completely fail to accomplish their efforts, and actually are going to burn eternally in hell.
[01:40:17.757 --> 01:40:19.598]  They're not going to destroy it all.
[01:40:19.998 --> 01:40:33.084]  Well, actually, the question part of it, Alex, is, Alan, you know, to your knowledge, who is the elite Maximus these humans are, above the usual, most well-known villains that I've mentioned?
[01:40:34.488 --> 01:40:37.489]  Well, you might be closer to a truth than you realize.
[01:40:37.509 --> 01:40:42.891]  There's definitely a power in this world that's making itself manifest through these people.
[01:40:43.972 --> 01:40:58.237]  And one of the symptoms of it is the fact that you can't get so many thousands of workers working towards this new world order, this planned horror society, where they're all like clones of each other on every single topic.
[01:40:58.277 --> 01:40:59.998]  That in itself is not normal.
[01:41:00.018 --> 01:41:00.938]  It's unnatural.
[01:41:01.673 --> 01:41:04.415]  So there's definitely something working through them.
[01:41:04.675 --> 01:41:08.138]  It's up to the individuals who do the study to figure out what it is.
[01:41:08.198 --> 01:41:12.301]  Well, people call it spirituality, but they've proven the sixth sense.
[01:41:12.321 --> 01:41:19.426]  They've proven that we're only seeing a thin band of the full spectrum and the sixth sense.
[01:41:20.427 --> 01:41:29.376]  Aborigines always know when their mother dies, they can be 3,000 miles away in a mine, and they come out and every time, you know, say an Australian said, my mother just died flying me out there, and they're always right.
[01:41:29.737 --> 01:41:31.398]  I mean, and I've experienced things like that.
[01:41:32.099 --> 01:41:37.124]  And it's true, the elite are tied together by almost like a spiritual broadcasting system.
[01:41:37.344 --> 01:41:40.267]  It's like they're downloading the same evil directory.
[01:41:41.408 --> 01:41:42.690]  What is that, Alan, in your opinion?
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:49.346]  Well, he went into ancient writings even before what we know as the Bible was written.
[01:41:49.406 --> 01:41:50.587]  He did talk about a war.
[01:41:50.607 --> 01:41:53.890]  A war in the heavens and in the earth.
[01:41:54.331 --> 01:41:57.394]  This is pre-Hebrew.
[01:41:58.615 --> 01:41:59.416]  And it wasn't over.
[01:41:59.436 --> 01:42:05.102]  It would last for thousands and thousands, maybe millions of years before the next clash would come along.
[01:42:05.999 --> 01:42:14.745]  And it was, again, written about in the Zoroastrian mysteries later on, to do with good and evil itself, always in battle with each other.
[01:42:15.626 --> 01:42:24.913]  And it's up to the individuals to say how they interpret this, but all you can really do, ultimately, is to interpret it according to your own personal life experience.
[01:42:24.993 --> 01:42:29.496]  Yeah, I can tell you how the elite, I can tell you how the elite interpret it.
[01:42:29.736 --> 01:42:32.018]  They're kind of along the fifth element line.
[01:42:33.722 --> 01:42:37.203]  But if you understand both sides and how to manipulate both sides of it too.
[01:43:02.592 --> 01:43:05.855]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:43:06.015 --> 01:43:10.098]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:43:10.278 --> 01:43:18.244]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:43:18.524 --> 01:43:21.706]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:43:21.927 --> 01:43:27.811]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:43:28.071 --> 01:43:32.434]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:43:32.734 --> 01:43:40.740]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:47.585]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare.
[01:43:51.776 --> 01:43:56.817]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A Silver.com or call 888-213-4338.
[01:43:56.837 --> 01:44:01.839]  888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[01:44:02.679 --> 01:44:04.059]  It is a big idea.
[01:44:04.079 --> 01:44:06.200]  A new world order.
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:11.101]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:44:11.781 --> 01:44:13.941]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:44:14.642 --> 01:44:16.782]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:44:17.402 --> 01:44:19.823]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:44:20.584 --> 01:44:27.915]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:44:30.956 --> 01:44:35.919]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:39.842]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:44:40.262 --> 01:44:42.744]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:44:42.824 --> 01:44:43.965]  Most people have no idea.
[01:44:43.985 --> 01:44:44.745]  They're not after money.
[01:44:44.765 --> 01:44:45.846]  They have all the money they need.
[01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:46.767]  They're after power.
[01:44:46.827 --> 01:44:47.867]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:47:07.249 --> 01:47:09.892]  Then we had Bob Chapman on, and of course Alan Watt.
[01:47:10.333 --> 01:47:13.858]  Restreaming until Sunday when we're live at InfoWars.com and the free podcast.

[01:47:29.122 --> 01:47:29.942]  Hey, how's it going gentlemen?
[01:47:29.962 --> 01:47:30.282]  Pretty good.
[01:47:59.113 --> 01:48:03.754]  I wanted to bring up a topic for kind of deep, I don't know, deep conversations.
[01:48:03.774 --> 01:48:05.575]  You can get deep sophisticated on this one.
[01:48:06.435 --> 01:48:10.396]  The document called Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.
[01:48:10.516 --> 01:48:11.417]  Colonel Alexander.
[01:48:12.177 --> 01:48:12.717]  Absolutely.
[01:48:12.757 --> 01:48:17.818]  To me, that document, I mean, that's basically the Rosetta Stone for the New World Order plan.
[01:48:17.838 --> 01:48:18.659]  I mean... No, no.
[01:48:18.879 --> 01:48:20.759]  They're cell towers, they're chemtrails.
[01:48:21.079 --> 01:48:23.420]  We're being hit with silent, soft kill weapons.
[01:48:24.068 --> 01:48:25.308]  Absolutely, it's all in there.
[01:48:25.348 --> 01:48:32.690]  You know, I'm sure, you know, you guys probably weren't prepared for like a real deep convo on this, but I was hoping that maybe in the future, you know, you guys could get together.
[01:48:32.710 --> 01:48:35.591]  Sir, we're totally prepared, but we got two minutes left.
[01:48:36.952 --> 01:48:38.912]  All right, well, Alan, what do you think?
[01:48:39.892 --> 01:48:42.413]  Yeah, as Brzezinski said, it's in the temperatronic era.
[01:48:42.753 --> 01:48:46.594]  He mentioned this technology briefly, but it's been set up for a while.
[01:48:46.614 --> 01:48:53.036]  It's old technology, but now we're setting up the equipment publicly in high concentration areas.
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:56.021]  And it will be used during the coming riots.
[01:48:58.102 --> 01:49:02.744]  I've been trying to... Go ahead.
[01:49:02.925 --> 01:49:15.071]  I've been trying to kind of talk to a lot of... I live in Massachusetts, and there's, you know, a huge Masonic community in this particular state, and I'm trying to explain to a lot of these people that, you know, they don't always tell you the truth, even if you are an initiate.
[01:49:15.651 --> 01:49:19.593]  And I try to explain... I want to know if I'm accurate when I say this.
[01:49:20.345 --> 01:49:26.709]  Most of the symbology has two meanings and they use the dual meanings for psychological profiling.
[01:49:39.665 --> 01:49:46.087]  It's triple, quadruple, meaning the porch masons, the masons, you can argue they were taken over, they're always bad.
[01:49:46.647 --> 01:49:48.208]  It's meant to control good men.
[01:49:48.388 --> 01:49:50.789]  And so later as higher level masons, they make them ride out.
[01:49:50.829 --> 01:49:52.009]  What would you do in this situation?
[01:49:52.029 --> 01:49:52.910]  What would you do in that situation?
[01:49:53.210 --> 01:49:56.091]  If you're a good person, they say, oh good, you're one of us, but they shelve you.
[01:49:56.411 --> 01:49:59.312]  If you're evil, they raise you up and elevate you.
[01:49:59.612 --> 01:50:01.073]  Alan Watt, closing comments on that.
[01:50:01.653 --> 01:50:05.154]  Well, they ask them at the top, do you want to have the crown or do you want to be a servant?
[01:50:05.274 --> 01:50:07.895]  So when it takes the crown, it's put off to the sidelines.
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:10.021]  Everything's a test, yeah.
[01:50:12.264 --> 01:50:12.805]  Absolutely.
[01:50:12.825 --> 01:50:13.666]  Anything else, Alan?
[01:50:14.608 --> 01:50:18.413]  Yes, the Lower Masons, as Pike said, are just the outer portico.
[01:50:18.433 --> 01:50:19.435]  They're no different.
[01:50:19.475 --> 01:50:21.418]  They know more than the general public.
[01:50:21.898 --> 01:50:22.860]  But they're useful idiots.
[01:50:24.102 --> 01:50:25.403]  Alan Watt, great talking to you.
[01:50:25.423 --> 01:50:26.823]  We'll talk to you again in the near future.
[01:50:26.863 --> 01:50:27.344]  God bless.
[01:50:28.004 --> 01:50:28.404]  And you too.
[01:50:29.125 --> 01:50:30.525]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:30.565 --> 01:50:32.226]  Rebroadcast starts one place.
[01:50:33.066 --> 01:50:35.248]  Infowars.com right now.
[01:50:35.268 --> 01:50:36.308]  We'll be back in one minute.
[01:50:36.748 --> 01:50:37.289]  Stay with us.
[01:50:37.529 --> 01:50:38.249]  Have a great weekend.
[01:50:39.029 --> 01:50:39.470]  Great job.
[01:50:43.111 --> 01:50:47.954]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:47.974 --> 01:50:50.055]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:52.506 --> 01:50:58.889]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:50:59.269 --> 01:51:01.230]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:02.991]  But who is the enemy?
[01:51:03.451 --> 01:51:03.991]  Bin Laden.
[01:51:04.251 --> 01:51:05.072]  This is his ammo.
[01:51:05.172 --> 01:51:06.552]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:51:06.612 --> 01:51:08.253]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
