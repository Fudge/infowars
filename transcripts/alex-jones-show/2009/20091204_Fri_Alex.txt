[00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:04.683]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:04.803 --> 00:00:06.184]  Live, live, live.
[00:00:06.204 --> 00:00:08.986]  We've been live for the last hour and 33 minutes.
[00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:11.048]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:11.628]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:12.049]  Central.
[00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:13.430]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.830]  Eastern.
[00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.053]  I come back with an abbreviated live broadcast Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:18.614 --> 00:00:20.976]  Because you can't stop the signal, you can't stop freedom.
[00:00:21.823 --> 00:00:24.906]  The people are standing up, getting involved, shattering the left-right paradigm.
[00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:38.838]  By the way, Jesse Ventura's television show that I was a major consultant on, and I also appear in quite a few of the episodes, the first episode aired Wednesday, the highest ratings ever for True TV, formerly Court TV.
[00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:45.655]  This is bigger opening ratings than Glenn Beck got with his first shows on Fox News.
[00:00:46.395 --> 00:00:55.723]  And the rating services, I'm going to go over this article later, are trending that by the end of the series, it's only a seven-parter for January, it'll probably have over four million viewers.
[00:00:56.064 --> 00:00:57.425]  We're dwarfing Glenn Beck.
[00:00:58.837 --> 00:01:10.527]  Man, I'm really excited because they've already told me if it gets picked back up, which I'm sure it will now, I'm going to be an even bigger part of the production, as you heard Jesse Ventura say last week with us, coming up.
[00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:14.270]  And people are shocked that it's anti-New World Order.
[00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.091]  It's our view.
[00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:16.011]  It's our angle.
[00:01:16.852 --> 00:01:18.774]  And people can't believe this is on television.
[00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:23.137]  They can't believe Ventura is going on Larry King Live, saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:01:23.598 --> 00:01:25.700]  Yes, Ventura is for real.
[00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.391]  I really started waking him up with others about four years ago.
[00:01:30.432 --> 00:01:36.154]  And as he's talked about here on air, and he's got a book coming out about the New World Order, we're really educating him quickly.
[00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:41.416]  And so, very, very exciting to see this happening.
[00:01:42.797 --> 00:01:45.358]  Ventura's not perfect, none of us are, but he's for real.
[00:01:45.978 --> 00:01:46.539]  He's real.
[00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:49.580]  What you see is what you get, and we are really educating him.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.961]  As you heard in that hour-plus interview last week.
[00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:53.776]  So we're going to get into that.
[00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:55.357]  Let me tell you who's not real.
[00:01:55.797 --> 00:01:57.278]  This guy Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:01:58.579 --> 00:01:59.940]  This guy is a complete fraud.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.542]  Now you can prove everything he's saying is a fraud in about five minutes.
[00:02:05.363 --> 00:02:20.073]  Two segments ago, two breaks ago, I was here reading this Global Warming news article about Schwarzenegger where he says that
[00:02:21.823 --> 00:02:30.785]  Treasure Island, Alcatraz, and much of San Francisco will be under as much as 35 to 40 feet of water.
[00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:45.049]  Now, the United Nations IPCC, who has been caught cooking the books at three major universities, we have the emails between the universities, the head universities, their head climate centers engage in fraud.
[00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.550]  Even with their cooked data, it's less than a foot that they're saying it's going to race.
[00:02:52.932 --> 00:02:57.813]  The White House science czar is running around telling people 13 feet.
[00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:02.754]  Literally pulling it out of... Well, we have children listening.
[00:03:02.794 --> 00:03:04.355]  I'm not going to say where he's pulling it out from.
[00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:06.055]  You know what monkeys do at the zoo, though.
[00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:09.016]  The point is, where do monkeys get what they throw?
[00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:10.076]  I'm sorry.
[00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:12.016]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:03:12.516 --> 00:03:18.498]  Schwarzenegger looks like such a monkey with his hair implants up on top and his little steroided-out eyes.
[00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:21.486]  I mean, that guy is just a piece of trash.
[00:03:21.526 --> 00:03:23.926]  Get out of my country, you un-American piece of garbage.
[00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:24.867]  Just get out!
[00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:25.947]  Get out!
[00:03:26.987 --> 00:03:29.248]  Al Gore, get out of here, you piece of trash!
[00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:31.328]  Alright, alright, I'm not going to get mad.
[00:03:31.348 --> 00:03:33.969]  It's been a long time since there's been an Alex Jones rant.
[00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.050]  And you know when I rant?
[00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.930]  It's when I get a headache.
[00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.651]  Because it's like overload, like Robbie the Robot.
[00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:42.132]  Cannot compute, cannot compute.
[00:03:42.172 --> 00:03:44.514]  Too much corruption, too much proof, too much fraud.
[00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:46.636]  Hundreds of world leaders calling for global government.
[00:03:46.937 --> 00:03:48.758]  The public's still dumbed down, not waking up.
[00:03:48.998 --> 00:03:50.640]  Cannot compute, cannot compute.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.561]  And then I start screaming.
[00:03:57.365 --> 00:04:01.289]  But in one break, we Google the term
[00:04:02.728 --> 00:04:05.350]  Highest point in San Francisco.
[00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.631]  Did you guys run me the mountain in the print-off yet?
[00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:11.313]  This just happened 10 minutes ago.
[00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:12.174]  938 feet.
[00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:13.775]  Put it up on screen.
[00:04:14.255 --> 00:04:18.438]  Mount Davidson is the highest point in San Francisco.
[00:04:19.858 --> 00:04:21.079]  I'm gonna read off that in a moment.
[00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:23.921]  900 feet.
[00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:26.002]  Now, yeah, it's gonna be underwater, Schwarzenegger.
[00:04:27.923 --> 00:04:29.024]  A city on hills.
[00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:30.004]  But then,
[00:04:31.198 --> 00:04:38.903]  In our first Google search, we put in sea level in San Francisco, and instead got their tidal data of the last hundred years.
[00:04:39.803 --> 00:04:40.824]  And guess what it shows?
[00:04:40.904 --> 00:04:46.407]  Except for when there's earthquakes, the overall sea level of San Francisco is dropping.
[00:04:46.447 --> 00:04:49.489]  And in the last eight years, it's dropped a massive amount.
[00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.510]  The sea level is dropping.
[00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.571]  And of course, the Earth was heating.
[00:04:54.012 --> 00:04:54.992]  Then it started cooling.
[00:04:55.472 --> 00:04:57.394]  Nine years ago, as the internal climate data shows.
[00:04:57.454 --> 00:04:59.095]  And so, oh, eight years ago,
[00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:03.097]  Blow that up on screen for people watching us at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.768]  You average them together, you can see a few points where it raised when they had earthquakes, and you go to the data page, it reports that.
[00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.521]  But you see an overall dropping since the last big earthquake in 2005.
[00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:19.782]  That was the only time it went up for a while.
[00:05:20.522 --> 00:05:25.104]  And then you see a drop this year from last year, and the year before, and the year before that.
[00:05:25.564 --> 00:05:28.866]  And then a dropping before that, going back to before 2000.
[00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:39.131]  And then we have a 140-year graph, because it's been a big seaport, and the sailors are meticulous about recording those.
[00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:41.492]  So we have that recorded back to 1850.
[00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:47.339]  We have sea levels recorded in San Francisco to 1850.
[00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.121]  And from 1850 until 1940, there was a trend up several feet.
[00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:59.545]  And then in 1940, a massive drop until 1960, a little bit of a rise, little bit of a rise, rising up into 1980 and now dropping.
[00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:15.984]  So, there you have it.
[00:06:16.404 --> 00:06:21.249]  And of course, if these numbers showed it was spiking up, we'd have to go get our own numbers, because the scientists all get caught lying.
[00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:32.739]  But again, these are numbers just collected by the, well, now the government of San Francisco and the federal government, but again, sailors have always had a penchant for recording sea levels.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.501]  This is something they want to know and understand.
[00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:40.427]  But the issue is, here is Schwarzenegger saying that
[00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:42.535]  Let me read the quote.
[00:06:42.755 --> 00:06:43.495]  Global warming.
[00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:51.339]  California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger puts his hand on top of a map over San Francisco's Treasure Island to show how it could be submerged in just a century.
[00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:59.164]  And then they're putting out these tourist reports and saying, oh, there won't be any wineries if it keeps heating.
[00:07:00.605 --> 00:07:05.587]  Though if you go back to the Middle Ages, the last time it really heated up, more wine was produced, more grapes.
[00:07:06.048 --> 00:07:07.728]  Northern England was growing good grapes.
[00:07:07.768 --> 00:07:08.309]  They can't now.
[00:07:09.994 --> 00:07:12.436]  So he lies about that and says you're not going to be able to have any wine.
[00:07:12.656 --> 00:07:13.977]  Oh, there won't be any snowboarding.
[00:07:14.217 --> 00:07:19.021]  You know, none of this is going to happen because... Oh, and then he lies in the video and says, oh, there's no water.
[00:07:19.301 --> 00:07:28.607]  Yeah, because at eight different major reservoirs, mountain reservoirs, the government, for environmental reasons, in the last two years, as you've seen all over television, has cut the water off to the people.
[00:07:29.868 --> 00:07:34.732]  Just like Schwarzenegger and Enron cut the power off to everybody before he was even governor.
[00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:37.894]  He was involved in those meetings to jack up prices and make huge profits.
[00:07:37.914 --> 00:07:38.935]  He made money off that.
[00:07:42.884 --> 00:07:53.288]  So I need Paul Watson or Kurt Nemo or Aaron Dykes or Steve Watson, one of our riders, to just go get the data and show that, A, the U.N.
[00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:55.629]  itself says the water level is going to go up by one foot.
[00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.570]  And they might be right, because it fluctuates.
[00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.551]  It might go down two feet.
[00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:00.411]  It might go up five feet.
[00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:02.352]  The point is, they're saying that.
[00:08:04.473 --> 00:08:08.294]  Schwarzenegger is lying and saying much of San Francisco will be underwater.
[00:08:08.594 --> 00:08:09.295]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:08:10.106 --> 00:08:11.627]  I've been to San Francisco many times.
[00:08:11.687 --> 00:08:15.090]  You go back a quarter mile from the side of the ocean and you're in the hills.
[00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.410]  I mean, this is asinine.
[00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:21.394]  The UN says one foot, one foot, and that's a fraud.
[00:08:21.674 --> 00:08:25.217]  The truth is they don't know what's going to happen because the Earth is always changing.
[00:08:25.437 --> 00:08:27.538]  First it's global freezing, then it's global warming.
[00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:29.240]  Now they say climate change.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.123]  Every time it's hot in the summer, they tell kids on Nickelodeon, oh my god, we're all roasting.
[00:08:34.443 --> 00:08:36.265]  You know, it's hot outside because of global warming.
[00:08:36.305 --> 00:08:40.748]  No, it's hot because the earth, the part of the earth we're on is tilted towards the sun!
[00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.451]  I'm gonna stop ranting.
[00:08:45.472 --> 00:08:48.654]  Just play the Schwarzenegger brainwashing video they put out.
[00:08:49.535 --> 00:08:57.681]  And then I'm gonna play, two days ago, John P. Holdren, the White House science czar, who wrote Ecoscience,
[00:09:00.128 --> 00:09:02.090]  You know why I've been showing this book every day for the last year?
[00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:09.755]  Where the White House Science Czar writes a textbook saying he wants to put poison in the water to sterilize you and wants to reduce world population under a global government?
[00:09:09.996 --> 00:09:10.696]  These are quotes!
[00:09:13.018 --> 00:09:13.478]  Don't believe me?
[00:09:13.498 --> 00:09:15.440]  Just Google Ecoscience John P. Holdren.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.802]  You'll get Reuters AP with the stinking quotes in it.
[00:09:21.605 --> 00:09:22.746]  This guy getting grilled.
[00:09:23.306 --> 00:09:24.527]  So, that's coming up.
[00:09:25.448 --> 00:09:27.629]  But first, let's play Schwarzenegger, the liar.
[00:09:27.669 --> 00:09:28.030]  Here it is.
[00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:34.293]  The tour that we're about to take is designed to promote awareness of the challenges that we face from climate change.
[00:09:34.313 --> 00:09:34.894]  Give me your money.
[00:09:34.934 --> 00:09:38.858]  And the kind of things that we can do together to overcome those challenges.
[00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:42.161]  In California, we're already seeing this.
[00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:49.429]  When I was a bodybuilder and it came out, I would rip people off on shows I put on and the movie I made and never pay them.
[00:09:50.319 --> 00:09:57.146]  And I was always scamming everyone and laughing about how stupid everybody is and how I get it over on them and how pathetic.
[00:09:57.507 --> 00:10:06.156]  And I would hand out records of Hitler speeches to people and dress up like a Nazi at parties and run into the gym screaming, down with the blacks!
[00:10:06.556 --> 00:10:07.257]  Down with them!
[00:10:07.297 --> 00:10:08.838]  They're not humans!
[00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:13.003]  It's so funny what I've done to everybody and how stupid you are!
[00:10:13.423 --> 00:10:14.504]  I want your guns.
[00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.866]  I want open borders.
[00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:20.690]  There's 30% unemployment in many areas of California.
[00:10:21.191 --> 00:10:21.811]  Give me that article.
[00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:22.852]  I saw you guys printing it earlier.
[00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:25.552]  All of this is so funny!
[00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:26.992]  Now let me scare you!
[00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:29.713]  Like you're a bunch of little stupid children!
[00:10:30.034 --> 00:10:32.495]  And tell you, you're all going to drown!
[00:10:32.955 --> 00:10:34.436]  You're all going to drown!
[00:10:34.456 --> 00:10:36.676]  If you don't let me tax everything!
[00:10:36.957 --> 00:10:43.539]  And if the legislature won't pass a law for me to ban TVs and tax them, then I'll just do it myself!
[00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:45.000]  Because I'm a dictator!
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.301]  I always dreamed of being a dictator!
[00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:48.442]  Like Hitler!
[00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:50.062]  That's a quote, Rolling Stone.
[00:10:51.563 --> 00:10:51.623]  Oh!
[00:10:53.354 --> 00:10:56.539]  El Centro holds position for highest jobless rate in the country.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.142]  CNN Money, 32.2%. 32%.
[00:11:03.632 --> 00:11:04.293]  You like it?
[00:11:04.693 --> 00:11:05.714]  I know you do.
[00:11:06.034 --> 00:11:07.575]  I know you love it now.
[00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:09.777]  You're going to enjoy it a lot more.
[00:11:09.797 --> 00:11:12.219]  In fact, pull up Schwarzenegger race quotes.
[00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:14.741]  I want everybody to see this live on TV and radio.
[00:11:14.981 --> 00:11:21.406]  Just go to Google or startpage.com or any other great search engine and type in Schwarzenegger Hitler quotes.
[00:11:22.006 --> 00:11:29.252]  And I didn't, when I made Marshall Law that has a section on Schwarzenegger in 2005, I didn't just believe the newspapers about this.
[00:11:29.812 --> 00:11:31.314]  I actually ordered the
[00:11:32.256 --> 00:11:39.999]  Rolling Stone, where he gave the interview, saying, I've always dreamed about powerful people like Hitler and being worshipped like Nuremberg, like a dictator.
[00:11:40.359 --> 00:11:43.580]  I want to be king of the world, and I'm going to be king of the world.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.861]  And you're not going to be able to top me.
[00:11:47.621 --> 00:11:49.402]  You're not going to be able to top me.
[00:11:50.882 --> 00:11:52.863]  Because you're all so stupid and wanting.
[00:11:54.121 --> 00:11:57.062]  I never get over how pathetic people are, how dumb they are.
[00:11:57.343 --> 00:11:59.364]  I love to dominate stupid people.
[00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:00.824]  Well, I'm not stupid!
[00:12:01.405 --> 00:12:03.426]  Get out of here, you usurper crook!
[00:12:05.567 --> 00:12:07.808]  All these stupid Republican groups don't talk about Arnie.
[00:12:07.848 --> 00:12:08.568]  We like it.
[00:12:08.788 --> 00:12:09.829]  Just wantin' our guns.
[00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:16.972]  Now, just bring up Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hitler quote.
[00:12:18.693 --> 00:12:20.694]  Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes Rolling Stones.
[00:12:20.734 --> 00:12:21.535]  That'll get it for ya.
[00:12:22.735 --> 00:12:23.736]  I wouldn't use Yahoo.
[00:12:25.154 --> 00:12:27.455]  Sorry, they don't have the best search engine in town.
[00:12:30.436 --> 00:12:31.497]  No offense to Yahoo.
[00:12:33.197 --> 00:12:33.798]  Okay, whatever.
[00:12:34.538 --> 00:12:35.418]  We'll pull those quotes up.
[00:12:35.438 --> 00:12:36.919]  They're in my film, Martial Law, too.
[00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:39.200]  With copies of The Rolling Stone and others.
[00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:49.204]  They were gonna release, a few years ago, the outtakes of him saying it on video for Pumping Iron, but he bought the film for like five times what it was worth, just so that it wouldn't be released.
[00:12:49.604 --> 00:12:51.185]  Schwarzenegger now owns Pumping Iron.
[00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:55.901]  I'm going to go ahead now.
[00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:59.546]  Like I said, you'll want to search it in another search engine.
[00:13:00.407 --> 00:13:05.374]  I want to go ahead and just play, finish up with Schwarzenegger, then I'm going to play Holdren being grilled.
[00:13:05.394 --> 00:13:05.795]  Stay with us.
[00:13:08.783 --> 00:13:21.654]  Average temperatures in our state rose nearly 2 degrees, and if greenhouse gas emissions are not substantially reduced, scientists tell us that temperatures in California could rise an additional 7 degrees during this century.
[00:13:22.175 --> 00:13:22.295]  Lie!
[00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:22.855]  Back it up!
[00:13:23.056 --> 00:13:23.976]  Back it up!
[00:13:23.996 --> 00:13:24.497]  Back it up!
[00:13:24.877 --> 00:13:25.958]  I mean, this is just all lies.
[00:13:26.258 --> 00:13:29.661]  He uses the same IPCC hockey stick graph right there.
[00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:32.564]  That's a whole other scandal.
[00:13:32.664 --> 00:13:35.587]  I'll guarantee you that that's a fraud right there.
[00:13:36.738 --> 00:13:37.739]  When they have fires.
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:39.540]  Everybody in L.A.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.143]  knows, the police know, you have nuts that go around setting fires everywhere when the winds get up every year.
[00:13:44.624 --> 00:13:46.845]  And they go, look, there are fires!
[00:13:47.206 --> 00:13:48.307]  The global warming!
[00:13:48.567 --> 00:13:50.348]  The global warming!
[00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:52.029]  Give me your money!
[00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.192]  No, it's that you've got 10 million people in L.A.
[00:13:55.532 --> 00:13:59.655]  with a couple thousand lunatics that go into the rich areas and try to burn everything down because they hate wealth.
[00:14:01.363 --> 00:14:05.324]  If not the global warming doing it, let's go back to the global warming man.
[00:14:05.604 --> 00:14:06.884]  I am Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:14:07.464 --> 00:14:08.005]  Here he is.
[00:14:08.865 --> 00:14:17.927]  And if greenhouse gas emissions are not substantially reduced, scientists tell us that temperatures in California could rise an additional seven degrees during this century.
[00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:18.627]  Oh yeah.
[00:14:19.367 --> 00:14:23.668]  Perhaps one of the greatest risks from climate change is a less reliable water supply.
[00:14:23.688 --> 00:14:26.469]  The Californians have long struggled.
[00:14:27.349 --> 00:14:29.131]  California, long struggle with it.
[00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:32.233]  See, he knows that people are aware of the water supply.
[00:14:32.453 --> 00:14:34.515]  And the fact the government's cutting it off at every front.
[00:14:35.816 --> 00:14:36.637]  But they don't care.
[00:14:36.657 --> 00:14:40.481]  He's gonna tell you, you know, humans have never had problems with water supply.
[00:14:40.501 --> 00:14:45.005]  You know, we shouldn't dig more wells or build desalinization or not let the government keep the water back.
[00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:47.026]  No, it's climate change that's doing it.
[00:14:47.967 --> 00:14:48.648]  Back to the liar.
[00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:51.099]  Yes!
[00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:18.404]  This would pose extreme challenges to water managers, hamper hydropower generation and nearly eliminate skiing, snowboarding and other recreational activities.
[00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:25.151]  Now another area of concern for California is our 1,100 miles of scenic coastline.
[00:15:26.152 --> 00:15:29.295]  Our coast, home to over 25 million people,
[00:15:29.835 --> 00:15:36.918]  He's vulnerable to a range of natural hazards, including storms, high tides, and rising sea levels.
[00:15:37.318 --> 00:15:48.223]  By investing in green technology, we can create a new economic foundation for the 21st century that is built on clean fuel, clean energy, and clean cars.
[00:15:48.783 --> 00:15:52.804]  One terrific example is, for instance, the car company called Tesla Motors.
[00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:54.185]  Tesla manufactures cars.
[00:15:54.505 --> 00:15:58.807]  That's enough from him, and you can go watch his press conference online saying San Francisco will be underwater.
[00:16:00.114 --> 00:16:03.357]  And they candy-coat things like clean cars, new technology.
[00:16:03.397 --> 00:16:03.897]  Sounds good.
[00:16:03.937 --> 00:16:04.618]  It's taxes.
[00:16:05.158 --> 00:16:10.783]  They just put a bunch of things that sound reasonable up front so people hear it and it sounds reasonable and they can get on board with it.
[00:16:11.504 --> 00:16:15.787]  Now remember, Schwarzenegger got in trouble with Kurt Voltheim, the top Nazi.
[00:16:15.807 --> 00:16:17.128]  He was also the head of the UN.
[00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:21.152]  Turned out the UN knew he was an SS officer, just like Schwarzenegger's dad.
[00:16:22.353 --> 00:16:25.636]  And Voltheim, of course, was a eugenicist for world population reduction.
[00:16:26.056 --> 00:16:28.178]  So of course Schwarzenegger is going to be for eugenics.
[00:16:29.073 --> 00:16:34.237]  Global warming is the eugenics front, their excuse to shut off your resources.
[00:16:35.097 --> 00:16:46.046]  Now when we come back from break, I am going to, you can go to ArnoldExposed.com, you notice you found one of my websites, and that actually has the quotes.
[00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:49.128]  Go to the quotes, see on the side, it says the quote links.
[00:16:51.397 --> 00:16:53.499]  And it has his quotes.
[00:16:54.239 --> 00:16:57.001]  I thought about the fame, about just being the greatest.
[00:16:57.061 --> 00:17:01.524]  I was dreaming about being some dictator of a country or some savior like Jesus.
[00:17:04.526 --> 00:17:07.308]  My relationship to power and authority is I'm all for it.
[00:17:07.368 --> 00:17:08.269]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.669]  U.S.
[00:17:09.709 --> 00:17:10.590]  News and World Report 1990.
[00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.811]  People need somebody to watch over them.
[00:17:13.831 --> 00:17:18.693]  95% of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[00:17:19.073 --> 00:17:20.213]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, U.S.
[00:17:20.253 --> 00:17:21.154]  News and World Report.
[00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:26.716]  My friends don't want me to mention Kurt's name because of all the recent Nazi stuff and the U.N.
[00:17:26.736 --> 00:17:27.356]  controversy.
[00:17:27.616 --> 00:17:29.737]  But I love him, and Maria does too.
[00:17:29.977 --> 00:17:30.998]  And so thank you, Kurt.
[00:17:31.952 --> 00:17:36.236]  Arnold Schwarzenegger on his friend and fellow Austrian Kurt Voltheim, the Nazi war criminal.
[00:17:36.836 --> 00:17:38.098]  I was born to be a leader.
[00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:40.780]  I love the fact that millions of people look up to me.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.202]  I'll find you some Hitler quotes here in a minute.
[00:17:43.843 --> 00:17:46.205]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:47.346]  Stay with us.
[00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:49.848]  We'll show you a holdren being grilled straight ahead.
[00:17:51.449 --> 00:17:56.434]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:00.030]  I think so.
[00:18:22.432 --> 00:18:23.033]  We're good to go!
[00:18:51.246 --> 00:18:52.507]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:18:52.547 --> 00:18:57.912]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:18:58.152 --> 00:19:02.776]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:19:03.177 --> 00:19:08.241]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:19:08.742 --> 00:19:13.426]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:19:13.959 --> 00:19:20.881]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:47.593]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:19:47.913 --> 00:19:50.354]  This is Alex Jones for Survival Seed Bank dot com.
[00:19:51.195 --> 00:19:55.417]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[00:19:55.697 --> 00:19:59.739]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called ciaga.
[00:19:59.979 --> 00:20:10.424]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is handpicked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called defense.

[00:20:52.411 --> 00:20:57.573]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:58.234 --> 00:21:00.575]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:04.196]  Standing up to scammers, crooks, criminals, usurpers everywhere.
[00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:05.077]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:07.418]  This is a five and a half minute clip.
[00:21:07.458 --> 00:21:08.378]  This segment's five minutes.
[00:21:08.398 --> 00:21:10.680]  We're going to play part of it, come back with the rest then, Bob Chapman.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:19.144]  And your phone calls will shift into the economy and a bunch of other climate gate news that's coming out as their whole fraud crashes and burns beautifully.
[00:21:20.031 --> 00:21:27.337]  But here's Senator Sensenbrenner grilling the chief eugenicist, the White House science czar, John P. Holdren.
[00:21:27.577 --> 00:21:28.998]  Here is that video and audio.
[00:21:30.268 --> 00:21:34.169]  Back to the emails that ended up being placed in the public record.
[00:21:34.989 --> 00:21:40.350]  And I don't want to get to whether or not they were legally placed in the public record.
[00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.651]  The question is whether or not they were accurate.
[00:21:43.191 --> 00:21:46.331]  Because if they were accurate, it's profoundly disturbing.
[00:21:46.492 --> 00:21:49.452]  And it does end up... They're admitted to be accurate.
[00:21:49.472 --> 00:21:50.592]  They're admitted to be real.
[00:21:50.672 --> 00:21:51.273]  Climate change.
[00:21:51.293 --> 00:21:53.313]  I want to add that.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:22:02.884]  The data from the Climate Research Unit at the UEA in England is one of only three major data sets, but they considerably overlap.
[00:22:03.704 --> 00:22:09.287]  And they've been used as a basis for the IPCC report, as well as the U.S.
[00:22:09.307 --> 00:22:11.267]  Global Change Research Program.
[00:22:11.688 --> 00:22:22.272]  And that means that these two booklets that were passed out this morning, you know, at best need to have a thorough review in the light of this information that has been disclosed.
[00:22:22.853 --> 00:22:29.146]  And at worst, it's junk science and it is a part of a massive international scientific fraud.
[00:22:29.997 --> 00:22:39.360]  Now, Dr. Holden, you've been in the middle of a lot of this, and I've got a couple of questions based upon your statements before you joined the Obama administration.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:54.444]  You gave an interview in August of 2006 with BBC News in the UK, and you said that a sea level rise of up to 13 feet was in the realm of possibility.
[00:22:55.373 --> 00:23:05.467]  However, that's 11 feet higher than what the IPPC has estimated over this period of time, which is somewhere between 7 and 23 inches.
[00:23:06.348 --> 00:23:10.935]  Now, with respect to the hockey stick theory, which the chairman has referred to,
[00:23:12.495 --> 00:23:17.498]  That's been pretty much discredited in the scientific community.
[00:23:18.078 --> 00:23:35.046]  And yet, in your October 13th email, which is now in the public record, you aggressively attacked the two scientists that put this together, a Dr. Willie Soon and a Dr. Sally Balyunas for that.
[00:23:40.322 --> 00:23:43.164]  I think it's pretty clear that in both cases you were wrong.
[00:23:44.064 --> 00:23:56.872]  And I guess I'd like to know if you're concerned now that you're in the White House and representing all of the public, whether you're concerned about the misrepresentation of the state of science with respect to global warming.
[00:23:57.392 --> 00:24:06.457]  And I'd also like to know if you still support the principal critic of those who trashed the hockey stick theory.
[00:24:08.298 --> 00:24:21.227]  And that is a Dr. Michael Mann, knowing of his efforts now to hide his data and to encourage his colleagues to shut out journals like Climate Research to publish works contrary to his own bias.
[00:24:23.956 --> 00:24:28.799]  Congressman, let me try to take those in the order you asked them.
[00:24:28.979 --> 00:24:37.404]  And the very first part of your statement, with respect, I would disagree with you that this current uproar calls into question all of climate science.
[00:24:37.665 --> 00:24:43.968]  We're going to come back and finish the last few minutes of Pinhead up there lying.
[00:24:45.249 --> 00:24:46.650]  But you notice he said uproar.
[00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:47.851]  They know it's an uproar.
[00:24:49.093 --> 00:24:53.837]  That's why Gore is now cancelling a lot of his speaking engagements and in Copenhagen cancelling his big engagement.
[00:24:54.378 --> 00:24:57.440]  Because everywhere they go, people are shouting them down, bringing up Climategate.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:01.564]  They just can't sit up there and push their fraud now without being challenged.
[00:25:02.464 --> 00:25:04.987]  People are challenging them everywhere.
[00:25:05.507 --> 00:25:11.052]  And so they're kind of retreating for now, hoping we forget about this so they can come back and continue setting up their global government.
[00:25:11.312 --> 00:25:14.054]  And that's Ban Ki-moon, head of the UN, Secretary General, saying,
[00:25:14.855 --> 00:25:17.677]  The carbon tax is the funding mechanism for the world government.
[00:25:18.277 --> 00:25:21.460]  That's what I report in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.022]  It exposes the whole climate gate fraud.
[00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:30.606]  That's why everybody needs to get it on DVD at InfoWars.com and get a free Obama t-shirt, anti-Obama t-shirt when they do.

[00:26:55.518 --> 00:26:56.138]  Big Brother.
[00:26:56.818 --> 00:26:57.858]  Mainstream media.
[00:26:58.579 --> 00:26:59.679]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:00.319 --> 00:27:01.139]  You want answers?
[00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:02.820]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:11.761]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:14.182 --> 00:27:19.503]  Halfway into this transmission, Bob Chapman joining us after the break to break down the economy.
[00:27:21.004 --> 00:27:28.790]  Your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 as well on this Friday, December 4, 2009 edition.
[00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:33.274]  We're continuing exposing the ClimateGate fraud, now into week number two.
[00:27:33.774 --> 00:27:49.287]  And here's Holdren, after he was just exposed as a fraud, saying, well, I don't think this uproar brings into question that sea levels are going to rise 13 feet, when no one's saying that but him and Schwarzenegger, literally just making this up, and sea levels have actually dropped in San Francisco.
[00:27:50.213 --> 00:27:50.793]  Here we go.
[00:27:50.894 --> 00:27:51.494]  Here's the rest of it.
[00:27:51.514 --> 00:27:54.797]  I'm going to take those in the order you asked them.
[00:27:55.877 --> 00:28:04.304]  And the very first part of your statement, with respect, I would disagree with you that this current uproar calls into question all of climate science.
[00:28:04.484 --> 00:28:07.367]  I do not believe that it remotely... Well, sir, I didn't say that.
[00:28:07.407 --> 00:28:09.248]  I said it ought to be looked at again.
[00:28:09.268 --> 00:28:13.992]  And you know, there's increasing evidence of scientific fascism that's going on.
[00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:27.726]  And I think as policy makers who are making decisions about the state of the American economy for the next several generations that we ought to have accurate science and it appears there's enough question on whether the science we have is accurate.
[00:28:28.026 --> 00:28:28.687]  That's got to be.
[00:28:29.198 --> 00:28:29.699]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:30.099 --> 00:28:30.920]  Back it up a few seconds.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.400]  That's key.
[00:28:32.081 --> 00:28:43.011]  See, this is a private group of banks that are openly Goldman Sachs and others financing the carbon taxes, Al Gore and others, where you will pay taxes directly to them, then they give some of it to the UN.
[00:28:43.771 --> 00:28:45.293]  And they share it with your local communities.
[00:28:45.613 --> 00:28:49.176]  Hence, federalizing, internationalizing, and privatizing.
[00:28:49.216 --> 00:28:50.137]  This is piracy.
[00:28:50.738 --> 00:28:53.580]  This is a takeover of our entire economy.
[00:28:54.341 --> 00:28:56.524]  They said they want to abolish coal-powered fuel.
[00:28:57.024 --> 00:28:58.646]  51% of our power comes from coal.
[00:28:59.187 --> 00:29:02.952]  This is a total hijacking by these criminals that want a monopoly.
[00:29:03.773 --> 00:29:04.834]  This is a takeover!
[00:29:05.595 --> 00:29:06.296]  Go back to it!
[00:29:08.695 --> 00:29:15.919]  Several generations that we ought to have accurate science, and it appears there's enough question on whether the science we have is accurate.
[00:29:16.219 --> 00:29:21.042]  That's got to be resolved, and I wish we could have done it in this hearing, but the chairman wouldn't let us, but go ahead.
[00:29:22.082 --> 00:29:26.044]  I very much agree that we need to resolve the current issue.
[00:29:26.084 --> 00:29:30.147]  It's important to understand what has really gone on here to get to the bottom of it.
[00:29:30.907 --> 00:29:37.791]  As I indicated before, that's been one of the strengths of science over the years, the capacity to get to the bottom of controversies that emerge.
[00:29:38.749 --> 00:29:47.772]  In this book, Ecoscience, where he says he wants to drug the water supply to sterilize you and set up a planetary regime to carry out forced one-child policies.
[00:29:48.012 --> 00:29:50.272]  They're now teaching that in public schools worldwide.
[00:29:50.572 --> 00:29:51.293]  Right here in the U.S.
[00:29:51.353 --> 00:29:51.953]  it's being taught.
[00:29:52.433 --> 00:29:52.993]  We have the U.N.
[00:29:53.013 --> 00:29:56.654]  documents where they talk about how they're brainwashing your kids through the Department of Education.
[00:29:57.554 --> 00:29:59.855]  In here, he said we were going to have an ice age by 2000.
[00:29:59.895 --> 00:30:01.135]  He wrote this in, what, 1976?
[00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:01.536]  Or was it 1974?
[00:30:01.656 --> 00:30:02.376]  I've got Ecoscience.
[00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:13.114]  1977.
[00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:13.114]  Where's the Ice Age?
[00:30:13.434 --> 00:30:15.557]  You are a scientific fraud by design!
[00:30:15.757 --> 00:30:19.441]  And you're not going to investigate your own scientist engaged in fraud for you!
[00:30:19.701 --> 00:30:21.263]  You're in the emails, Holdren!
[00:30:21.483 --> 00:30:23.325]  You're involved in the fraud, you criminal!
[00:30:23.746 --> 00:30:24.367]  Back to him!
[00:30:25.154 --> 00:30:26.615]  We will get to the bottom of this one.
[00:30:27.235 --> 00:30:38.082]  But the key point is, however this particular controversy comes out, the result will not call into question the bulk of our understanding of how the climate works or how humans are affecting it.
[00:30:39.063 --> 00:30:43.486]  You mentioned an interview of mine a few years ago.
[00:30:43.866 --> 00:30:44.526]  I can't help it.
[00:30:45.227 --> 00:30:49.830]  The UN's own IPCC fairytale says that
[00:30:51.072 --> 00:30:57.115]  The ocean's gonna have between 7 inches and 23 inches, but you really read, they said the mean's about 1 foot, 12 inches.
[00:30:59.636 --> 00:31:03.017]  Then he says it's settled that men, that man is changing the climate.
[00:31:03.257 --> 00:31:08.900]  The UN's own report says man is 3 to 4 percent of the gases that they claim are heating things up.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.400]  It's a fraud!
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.182]  One volcano puts out more than man's put out in the last 100 years!
[00:31:15.102 --> 00:31:16.483]  He's a complete liar!
[00:31:18.032 --> 00:31:20.855]  Let's come back from break, play the last minute of this, and then go to Bob Chapman.
[00:31:20.895 --> 00:31:23.017]  But I'm really getting a headache here, just looking at this.
[00:31:23.277 --> 00:31:25.159]  This is a sinister little eugenicist.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.881]  Little population reducer.
[00:31:28.283 --> 00:31:29.424]  This guy makes me sick!
[00:31:35.137 --> 00:31:35.597]  Stay with us.
[00:31:35.617 --> 00:31:38.440]  Bob Chapman coming up with the latest with the Federal Reserve being routed.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:39.981]  So much other good news.
[00:31:40.041 --> 00:31:40.922]  More on Climategate.
[00:31:40.962 --> 00:31:41.763]  Your phone calls.
[00:31:42.443 --> 00:31:43.865]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[00:31:43.905 --> 00:31:45.686]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:31:45.706 --> 00:31:49.009]  We're also simulcasting via television at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:52.051 --> 00:31:55.693]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:56.073 --> 00:31:59.075]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:59.315 --> 00:32:04.098]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:32:04.118 --> 00:32:10.361]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:10.501 --> 00:32:12.743]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:13.283 --> 00:32:13.563]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:13.583 --> 00:32:14.004]  Bernanke?
[00:32:14.084 --> 00:32:14.865]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:14.885 --> 00:32:16.026]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:18.289]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:32.185 --> 00:32:34.007]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:32:34.027 --> 00:32:39.134]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:39.454 --> 00:32:48.565]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:53.893]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:54.293 --> 00:32:59.256]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:59.637 --> 00:33:01.358]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:33:01.678 --> 00:33:06.501]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:07.642]  How much do you want?
[00:33:07.862 --> 00:33:08.602]  When do you want it?
[00:33:08.983 --> 00:33:10.584]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:33:10.864 --> 00:33:11.705]  When will you need it?
[00:33:11.945 --> 00:33:14.006]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:33:14.146 --> 00:33:15.247]  Will there be any food?
[00:33:15.487 --> 00:33:16.808]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:33:17.008 --> 00:33:22.071]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:33:22.271 --> 00:33:25.473]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:33:25.854 --> 00:33:29.356]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:33:29.676 --> 00:33:30.657]  How much will you need?
[00:33:30.897 --> 00:33:31.517]  We don't know.
[00:33:31.797 --> 00:33:32.718]  How much do you want?
[00:33:32.918 --> 00:33:33.638]  All you can get.
[00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:34.519]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.919 --> 00:33:35.140]  I think.
[00:33:50.282 --> 00:33:57.125]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:33:57.245 --> 00:33:59.225]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:33:59.345 --> 00:34:01.466]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:34:01.586 --> 00:34:03.107]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:34:03.247 --> 00:34:07.568]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:34:07.708 --> 00:34:10.089]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:34:10.289 --> 00:34:14.911]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:16.092]  For your home or business.
[00:34:16.292 --> 00:34:21.016]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:34:21.076 --> 00:34:23.819]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:34:23.919 --> 00:34:26.541]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:34:26.641 --> 00:34:33.788]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:34:34.088 --> 00:34:40.010]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a COLABLUE at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.791]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:34:42.891 --> 00:34:49.434]  Or visit a COLABLUE on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:34:51.635 --> 00:34:57.237]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:34:59.798 --> 00:35:01.539]  Going to Bob Chapman here in just a moment.
[00:35:01.579 --> 00:35:02.259]  You know, when I call
[00:35:03.356 --> 00:35:10.583]  Holdren, a criminal, he's involved with the criminal emails, helping cover it up, helping persecute scientists that were telling the truth.
[00:35:11.884 --> 00:35:16.308]  And he's involved wanting to bring in an economic system that will at least double our energy prices.
[00:35:16.748 --> 00:35:18.050]  That's only one facet of it.
[00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:23.354]  And will devastate American families for his own profit and Al Gore's profit.
[00:35:23.675 --> 00:35:26.778]  Now that is a criminal, as Lord Mocton has said, they should all be arrested.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.141]  And Lord Mocta wouldn't come out with that unless we had clear evidence.
[00:35:30.181 --> 00:35:31.181]  These people are despicable.
[00:35:31.562 --> 00:35:32.622]  Let's finish up with Holdren.
[00:35:32.642 --> 00:35:33.042]  Here it is.
[00:35:33.962 --> 00:35:39.144]  ...in which I talked about the possibility of a sea level rise in this century as much as 13 feet.
[00:35:39.184 --> 00:35:44.947]  That was based on scientific peer-reviewed publications that appeared in the early 2000s... Head pause!
[00:35:44.967 --> 00:35:53.190]  ...that indicated that over... And all of that data came from these three climate research units that are all together in the emails cooking the books.
[00:35:54.977 --> 00:35:59.845]  See, they keep saying, okay, forget ClimateGate, we have peer-reviewed journals that are based on the fraud.
[00:36:00.226 --> 00:36:04.453]  See, everything he says is a debunkable lie instantly when you know the facts.
[00:36:04.874 --> 00:36:05.616]  Back to Holdren.
[00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:09.297]  ... time in periods of natural climate change.
[00:36:09.737 --> 00:36:22.521]  There had been episodes in which the rate of sea level rise increased by as much as two to five meters per century and that this could not be ruled out at the temperatures for which we were heading in the 21st century as a result of our activity.
[00:36:22.561 --> 00:36:28.042]  You're still 11 feet above what the IPCC was recommending.
[00:36:28.062 --> 00:36:30.363]  My time is almost up and I'd just like to
[00:36:30.848 --> 00:36:36.455]  You know, say that there's an awful lot of scientific McCarthyism, meaning name-calling, going on.
[00:36:36.835 --> 00:36:50.471]  Because I quote from your email of October 13, 2003, saying, doing this will reveal that Soon and Baliunas are essentially amateurs in the interpretation of historical and paleoclimatology.
[00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:51.532]  Thank you very much.
[00:37:14.406 --> 00:37:17.728]  I would be happy to answer all of the congressman's questions if I'm allowed.
[00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:25.254]  You will be given enough time, but let me turn right now and recognize the gentleman from Washington State.
[00:37:25.914 --> 00:37:27.976]  Yeah, let's not let that information come out.
[00:37:29.605 --> 00:37:30.345]  Bob Chapman.
[00:37:30.445 --> 00:37:31.746]  I was in Army Intelligence.
[00:37:31.786 --> 00:37:34.387]  Bob Chapman had the biggest private newsletter until he retired.
[00:37:34.427 --> 00:37:34.987]  He came back.
[00:37:35.427 --> 00:37:36.247]  One of the biggest again.
[00:37:36.267 --> 00:37:37.788]  The InternationalForecaster.com.
[00:37:38.168 --> 00:37:41.689]  Bob has been at one time the biggest private silver and gold broker.
[00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.411]  And we always enjoy having him visit with us at least once a week.
[00:37:45.851 --> 00:37:48.532]  I never thought you'd ask, because I've just done about 30 radio programs on it.
[00:38:16.241 --> 00:38:28.984]  And one of the things that I uncovered was that, and I don't know if you mentioned it or not, because I just cut in toward the end, the CRU received $23 million in taxpayers' funds.
[00:38:29.584 --> 00:38:30.544]  Did you highlight that?
[00:38:31.224 --> 00:38:33.485]  Yes, we wrote stories about that last week.
[00:38:33.905 --> 00:38:37.866]  That's just one funding group going to Professor Phil Jones at East Anglia.
[00:38:39.366 --> 00:38:41.987]  Yeah, Phil is no longer there, as you well know.
[00:38:44.404 --> 00:38:47.546]  I guess his comment was, it was so gracious of them to let me go.
[00:38:47.566 --> 00:38:56.054]  And I think he's extremely worried about getting criminal charges brought against him.
[00:38:56.755 --> 00:39:01.579]  And of course, the university didn't want to have anything to do with him anymore.
[00:39:02.059 --> 00:39:07.765]  The phrase was, I am so grateful to the university for agreeing to this.
[00:39:08.424 --> 00:39:09.184]  But anyway, it is.
[00:39:09.264 --> 00:39:16.468]  And that's, for those that don't know, Phil Jones is the head kingpin for the UN over all the universities getting this data together.
[00:39:16.488 --> 00:39:21.490]  This is the head guy caught with Holdren and everybody else engaged in fraud.
[00:39:22.791 --> 00:39:29.234]  Well, hopefully this will stop cap-and-trade and knock the Copenhagen meeting on its ear.
[00:39:30.135 --> 00:39:33.756]  And I don't know whether that'll happen because these people are so arrogant.
[00:39:33.776 --> 00:39:35.757]  They don't care what happens.
[00:39:36.117 --> 00:39:37.078]  They do what they want to do.
[00:39:38.098 --> 00:39:45.762]  And but I think we got him on the run here and especially with Congress getting into it quickly the way that they have.
[00:39:46.603 --> 00:39:49.124]  It just shows you how criminal these people are.
[00:39:49.704 --> 00:39:56.228]  And you know, so we we we switch away from academic fraud to financial fraud.
[00:39:57.197 --> 00:40:00.839]  And the financial fraud, of course, is going on in Wall Street.
[00:40:01.299 --> 00:40:08.843]  And the same fraudsters from Wall Street are the ones, Kinlay and others, and Madoff that engineered this and are working with Al Gore and others.
[00:40:08.903 --> 00:40:10.944]  Break that down as a segue into the economy.
[00:40:12.424 --> 00:40:15.966]  Well, the whole thing is about taxation.
[00:40:17.126 --> 00:40:19.187]  And so is in Copenhagen.
[00:40:19.968 --> 00:40:24.490]  And they want to hit them on both of them, they, taxpayers.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.061]  I don't think so.
[00:40:48.467 --> 00:40:49.147]  It is, Bob.
[00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:50.728]  So much is going on with this.
[00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:54.769]  We'll get back into it later and take some phone calls, but where do you want to start?
[00:40:54.809 --> 00:41:05.691]  The good news with open talk by Senator Sanders and others of blocking the confirmation, the re-confirmation of the private Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke.
[00:41:06.271 --> 00:41:10.372]  The fact that, as you know, a week and a half ago, it passed out a committee to audit the Fed.
[00:41:11.372 --> 00:41:14.793]  It looks like the Senate may try to block it, but still, this is a huge success.
[00:41:15.313 --> 00:41:17.154]  Or the lies about unemployment numbers.
[00:41:17.194 --> 00:41:17.794]  Where do we begin?
[00:41:19.212 --> 00:41:21.352]  Well, the unemployment numbers are to be expected.
[00:41:21.893 --> 00:41:32.935]  And the scenario today, and I don't know if Ted is coming on later, but he would have something strong to say about this, but the unemployment numbers are totally bogus.
[00:41:33.815 --> 00:41:40.296]  I'll show you the coincidence of events that happened last Thursday when Dubai was announced.
[00:41:41.276 --> 00:41:44.897]  And, of course, they picked that day because the American market was closed.
[00:41:45.806 --> 00:41:48.551]  And they did that so that the market wouldn't fall 500 points.
[00:41:48.571 --> 00:41:49.392]  It only fell 150.
[00:41:49.432 --> 00:41:57.445]  And it was managing the Dow Jones Industrial and S&P and NASDAQ indexes, if you may.
[00:41:58.311 --> 00:42:00.812]  At the same time, they hit gold for $50.
[00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:02.452]  It came back to a minus 12.
[00:42:03.433 --> 00:42:06.273]  The following day, it went up, and then Monday, the same.
[00:42:06.754 --> 00:42:10.635]  And then, of course, they come in today and attack voraciously.
[00:42:11.055 --> 00:42:14.716]  They hit gold for $50 again, like they did before.
[00:42:15.316 --> 00:42:16.997]  And they're not hitting the physical market.
[00:42:17.037 --> 00:42:18.317]  They're hitting it with derivatives.
[00:42:19.117 --> 00:42:22.058]  And they did the same thing with silver, but not in this bigger way.
[00:42:22.538 --> 00:42:27.380]  And they have the dollar up almost a point today on the USDX index.
[00:42:29.392 --> 00:42:31.213]  This is all coordinated.
[00:42:32.875 --> 00:42:34.796]  The numbers come out.
[00:42:35.157 --> 00:42:38.059]  The numbers are phony.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.342]  The Dubai thing, they knew about that for months.
[00:42:42.782 --> 00:42:46.025]  They just picked a date and coordinated all this together.
[00:42:46.766 --> 00:42:47.826]  And so what's going to happen?
[00:42:48.627 --> 00:42:52.550]  The dollar is going to go back down again because there's too many sellers out there.
[00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.852]  Gold and silver are going to go back up again.
[00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:57.374]  So it gives you a great opportunity to be a buyer.
[00:42:58.453 --> 00:43:11.261]  When you wouldn't normally have this opportunity, and the stock market's going to start getting weaker again, and they'll pay for Dubai over, probably over the next several years.
[00:43:11.862 --> 00:43:24.450]  It looks to me that they're probably offside over there, somewhere between $80 and $120 billion, which in the circumference of everything is really not a great amount.
[00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.752]  It might seem that it is, but nowadays when you have the
[00:43:28.331 --> 00:43:34.598]  The Fed lending out $12.7 trillion, another $100 billion is easy to cover up.
[00:43:34.938 --> 00:43:37.961]  Let me stop you for a moment because you're an expert on this and I'm not.
[00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:46.571]  We had Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts on two weeks ago, who for those who don't know is a former editor of the Wall Street Journal, former head of policy, Department of Treasury under Reagan.
[00:43:47.714 --> 00:43:55.599]  And he predicted on air that the dollar in the next few weeks would go back up because of this reverse carry trade that they have to cover themselves.
[00:43:56.439 --> 00:43:57.760]  And can you explain that to people?
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:06.186]  And that gold would go down for a while, but then go back up even higher because they can drive stuff down now as part of their manipulation, but they can't hold it down.
[00:44:07.126 --> 00:44:07.726]  That's true.
[00:44:08.147 --> 00:44:12.249]  And we brought this out, you and I, on this program a number of times.
[00:44:12.269 --> 00:44:14.791]  They affect the market for a day or two or three and that's it.
[00:44:15.307 --> 00:44:17.088]  And it's the same thing with the currency market.
[00:44:17.629 --> 00:44:25.195]  Goodness, they trade over $4 trillion a day in the forex, of which probably $2 to $2.5 trillion is in dollars.
[00:44:25.915 --> 00:44:29.338]  And so you try to manipulate that market more than one day, forget it.
[00:44:29.998 --> 00:44:39.285]  And it's got to be a coordinated effort where all of the bids on the other currencies in the USDX are hit.
[00:44:39.946 --> 00:44:41.007]  And then that's what they're doing.
[00:44:41.027 --> 00:44:43.989]  They're not making the dollar go up, they're making the other ones go down.
[00:44:44.625 --> 00:44:55.393]  The other ones being the pound, the yen, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, and the British pound, and the Swedish krona.
[00:44:56.014 --> 00:44:57.615]  And so they just hit the bids on them.
[00:44:57.695 --> 00:45:05.581]  And that was what that $500 billion currency swap was all about, about six or seven months ago.
[00:45:06.362 --> 00:45:10.725]  Because the other five nations that were involved
[00:45:11.388 --> 00:45:12.172]  Receive dollars.
[00:45:12.212 --> 00:45:15.024]  And they take those dollars and they go in and buy treasuries with them.
[00:45:15.847 --> 00:45:15.968]  U.S.
[00:45:15.988 --> 00:45:16.349]  treasuries.
[00:45:17.139 --> 00:45:29.567]  At the same time, the foreign currencies that were received by the Federal Reserve, they take those foreign currencies and they go in and sell them, making the foreign currencies go down and making the dollar go up.
[00:45:30.107 --> 00:45:31.268]  That's the game they're playing.
[00:45:31.308 --> 00:45:36.591]  And that's what Chapman, you've said in the past, in the last few weeks, that's exactly what Roberts said.
[00:45:36.911 --> 00:45:39.633]  What's the time frame then for gold that's down $45 today?
[00:45:39.773 --> 00:45:39.933]  It's at $1,162.
[00:45:43.675 --> 00:45:47.739]  What's the best guess time frame on when it'll go back up and when the dollar is going to drop?
[00:45:47.799 --> 00:45:48.559]  Middle of next week?
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:50.521]  Probably.
[00:45:50.601 --> 00:45:56.246]  And another thing, too, is for those of you who and I'm going to try to make this as simple as possible.
[00:45:57.166 --> 00:46:05.173]  In the the pits of the comics, there are the what they call the commercial traders in both silver and gold.
[00:46:05.854 --> 00:46:08.956]  And in this case, they're the same players to some extent.
[00:46:09.477 --> 00:46:11.879]  JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup.
[00:46:12.583 --> 00:46:14.425]  Hong Kong, Shanghai Bank, etc.
[00:46:15.426 --> 00:46:24.013]  And in gold, they have a short position net, because they have longs and shorts at the same time.
[00:46:24.073 --> 00:46:26.796]  Net of 306,000 contracts.
[00:46:28.217 --> 00:46:29.838]  That's the highest it's ever been.
[00:46:30.899 --> 00:46:36.504]  A normal contract for the short position for the commercials, as they're called, is 95,000.
[00:46:36.544 --> 00:46:39.627]  So it's just about triple.
[00:46:43.095 --> 00:46:49.743]  Explain what that means in layman's terms on the other side as we break down the rigged market with Bob Chapman.
[00:46:51.295 --> 00:46:58.797]  Air and Aqua dot com is your one stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[00:46:58.817 --> 00:47:03.118]  Aaron Aqua dot com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water.
[00:47:03.318 --> 00:47:07.299]  And they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[00:47:07.619 --> 00:47:12.161]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[00:47:12.381 --> 00:47:16.062]  Aaron Aqua dot com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[00:47:16.302 --> 00:47:20.443]  Aaron Aqua dot com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:47:20.723 --> 00:47:21.543]  We're good to go.
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:58.907]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:47:59.167 --> 00:48:04.972]  You can buy it at hereiswhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:48:05.272 --> 00:48:07.954]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:48:08.235 --> 00:48:14.140]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.921]  This book will work for anyone.
[00:48:16.081 --> 00:48:18.343]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:48:18.563 --> 00:48:23.947]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy, and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:48:24.187 --> 00:48:26.008]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:48:26.249 --> 00:48:27.670]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:30.272]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:48:30.552 --> 00:48:34.915]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:48:35.275 --> 00:48:38.658]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:48:38.978 --> 00:48:41.140]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.541]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:48:43.981 --> 00:48:46.663]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:48:51.226 --> 00:48:57.449]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:05.674]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:49:06.015 --> 00:49:11.598]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:49:11.918 --> 00:49:13.859]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:49:14.179 --> 00:49:18.941]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:49:19.261 --> 00:49:24.002]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:49:24.483 --> 00:49:28.204]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:49:28.824 --> 00:49:29.845]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:49:29.905 --> 00:49:34.008]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:49:34.429 --> 00:49:38.812]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:49:39.332 --> 00:49:41.894]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:49:42.315 --> 00:49:44.156]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:44.176 --> 00:49:44.537]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:44.577 --> 00:49:45.798]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:49:45.858 --> 00:49:49.781]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:49:58.832 --> 00:50:06.976]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[00:50:07.836 --> 00:50:09.717]  Rely on OxySilver instead.
[00:50:10.692 --> 00:50:16.056]  OxySilver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[00:50:16.557 --> 00:50:19.279]  OxySilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol.
[00:50:19.819 --> 00:50:21.541]  Far safer than colloidal silvers.
[00:50:22.201 --> 00:50:26.805]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[00:50:27.085 --> 00:50:30.368]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[00:50:30.848 --> 00:50:32.470]  So get it while you still can.
[00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:36.313]  Order OxySilver online at OxySilver.com.
[00:50:36.974 --> 00:50:40.037]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[00:50:40.557 --> 00:50:43.440]  Call toll-free 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.862]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:50:46.342 --> 00:50:47.764]  Order OxySilver today.
[00:50:48.024 --> 00:50:49.525]  This call could save your life.
[00:50:51.687 --> 00:51:00.355]  All right, Bob, you were getting into market manipulation, and
[00:51:01.553 --> 00:51:07.994]  Going over how they're triple short what they normally would be for people that aren't involved in the stock market or things they don't understand.
[00:51:08.334 --> 00:51:10.235]  Then coming back, I want to get into the good news.
[00:51:10.315 --> 00:51:11.955]  The Federal Reserve is in a lot of trouble.
[00:51:12.555 --> 00:51:18.837]  National polls show that just 21% favor Ben Bernanke being reappointed as the Fed chairman.
[00:51:18.857 --> 00:51:23.518]  So we're going to be talking about that and playing some clips of his grilling yesterday.
[00:51:23.578 --> 00:51:25.118]  But Bob Chapman, continue.
[00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:34.282]  Well, when you short something like gold bullion or silver bullion or gold stocks and silver stocks, you bet they're going to go down.
[00:51:35.123 --> 00:51:42.514]  And what you have to do eventually is you have to buy back the security that you sold, even though you didn't own it.
[00:51:43.656 --> 00:51:50.460]  And in this case, it's gold bullion that we're talking about, and there's a silver bullion market, and I cover that all the time in the International Forecaster.
[00:51:51.161 --> 00:51:53.222]  But this is a record short.
[00:51:53.722 --> 00:51:54.763]  Now, who's short?
[00:51:55.183 --> 00:51:56.704]  The United States government's short.
[00:51:57.245 --> 00:52:03.249]  They're the ones who are in there shorting the gold and silver market, and they're shorting the shares as well.
[00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:10.113]  And at least with the shares, we get a good idea of the breakdown of who's doing what.
[00:52:11.231 --> 00:52:16.175]  On the Bullion Exchange and the ComEx, you can't tell because they won't tell you.
[00:52:16.976 --> 00:52:21.119]  They just give you a total, whole figure of what they call commercials.
[00:52:21.479 --> 00:52:24.762]  But in the shares, you can tell because they have to state their positions.
[00:52:25.502 --> 00:52:35.450]  So we know that JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of New York, Citigroup, Barclays, and on and on.
[00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:36.671]  These are the shorts in there.
[00:52:36.931 --> 00:52:39.273]  And we know how much they're short, just like we do.
[00:52:40.018 --> 00:53:05.167]  In the bullion market and so there's a concentrated effort for the last couple of months to drive down all of those prices and also even in the commodity market as well trying to hold those prices down but that's a little bit more difficult to do because they're wider markets and so that's what our government is doing in the market right now and at the same time they're trying to make the dollar go up as I explained and how they do that
[00:53:06.195 --> 00:53:09.837]  And they also are trying to keep the stock market from falling.
[00:53:10.117 --> 00:53:21.361]  So they're coming in with mountains of fiat derivatives made up money, debt, and they're manipulating the market, trying to drive gold down.
[00:53:21.901 --> 00:53:22.582]  Please continue.
[00:53:23.862 --> 00:53:32.926]  And they're not, as Alex said, and as Mr. Roberts said, at best they can keep it going for a day or two and that's it.
[00:53:34.246 --> 00:53:40.428]  The dollar's going to go back down, the market's going to go back down, commodities are going to go back up, and gold and silver's going to go back up.
[00:53:40.468 --> 00:53:41.108]  So what do you do?
[00:53:41.528 --> 00:53:52.631]  You take advantage of the fact that the gold shares are down 10%, the coins are probably off 3 or 4 or 5%, and you go in and you buy, if you can.
[00:53:53.751 --> 00:53:55.712]  You add to your collection, if you can.
[00:53:56.572 --> 00:53:59.453]  You take advantage of an abnormal dip.
[00:54:00.073 --> 00:54:02.494]  It's my projection that
[00:54:02.901 --> 00:54:07.102]  The goal will test $1,550 to $1,650 by the 1st of April.
[00:54:07.122 --> 00:54:08.202]  And I think that we'll get that high.
[00:54:08.222 --> 00:54:09.602]  I think that's where this run is going.
[00:54:09.622 --> 00:54:12.663]  And I think that we would have had a normal mini correction anyway.
[00:54:28.703 --> 00:54:30.284]  I mean, no markets go up.
[00:54:30.465 --> 00:54:33.587]  We've had 21 out of 23 up days in gold.
[00:54:34.068 --> 00:54:35.369]  Well, you've got to have a correction.
[00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:36.950]  People take profits.
[00:54:37.411 --> 00:54:38.732]  Not everybody is investors.
[00:54:38.752 --> 00:54:40.514]  Some of them are traders.
[00:54:40.574 --> 00:54:46.559]  So, I've expected somewhere between 25 and 150 points.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:51.303]  And that would take gold back to somewhere in the vicinity of $1,100.
[00:54:51.343 --> 00:54:54.006]  Well, they've already done that for us.
[00:54:55.433 --> 00:55:01.500]  So what we have done is corrected the technical situation of being overbought.
[00:55:03.142 --> 00:55:06.385]  We'll get a little ground floor somewhere in here, and it'll go right back up again.
[00:55:06.726 --> 00:55:08.127]  Let me ask you this, Bob Chapman.
[00:55:08.347 --> 00:55:12.972]  Again, your predictions have always been devastatingly accurate here on air, so people are really taking notes.
[00:55:14.232 --> 00:55:20.533]  Two weeks ago, they tried to dump, as you know, billions and billions, tens of billions of dollars of gold in the market, thinking that would drive it down.
[00:55:21.013 --> 00:55:24.394]  But instead, the Indians, the Chinese and others grabbed it all up.
[00:55:25.034 --> 00:55:29.235]  Why was that manipulation to drive it down not successful, but this one has been?
[00:55:31.536 --> 00:55:37.857]  I think that what they've done is they've gone and talked to these entities.
[00:55:38.924 --> 00:55:42.005]  Such as India, why did you go out and take 200 tons of gold down?
[00:55:42.565 --> 00:55:49.226]  And Sri Lanka and Mauritania, whose orders were relatively inconsequential.
[00:55:49.806 --> 00:55:56.887]  But I think they really leaned on the Chinese, because the Chinese came out and said, well, we hope that this isn't a gold bubble here.
[00:55:57.747 --> 00:56:00.348]  Well, you've got to be kidding me, the Chinese aren't that stupid.
[00:56:01.008 --> 00:56:07.589]  So, that means that they were asked to say that, to keep the price of gold from running further.
[00:56:08.527 --> 00:56:17.271]  And I'm sure the story that was given by Geithner to the Chinese was, look, if it backs off, you can buy it cheaper.
[00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:20.633]  We just don't, we want it down for right now.
[00:56:21.513 --> 00:56:23.734]  And believe me, this sort of thing goes on.
[00:56:24.515 --> 00:56:28.417]  And so the Chinese come out and said something, and that didn't help the market, it backed off.
[00:56:28.697 --> 00:56:29.978]  What are the Chinese doing today?
[00:56:30.018 --> 00:56:30.738]  They're in there buying.
[00:56:32.697 --> 00:56:38.023]  Alright, I want to shift gears out of this area and get into what's happening with the Federal Reserve and unemployment numbers.
[00:56:38.343 --> 00:56:39.044]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:41.226 --> 00:56:42.127]  We're on the march.
[00:56:42.608 --> 00:56:44.230]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:47.834]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:57:50.327 --> 00:57:55.494]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:57:55.614 --> 00:57:57.557]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:57:57.697 --> 00:57:59.980]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.003]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:58:02.443 --> 00:58:03.805]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:58:04.045 --> 00:58:05.087]  There is a solution.

[00:58:57.154 --> 00:59:01.516]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.

[00:59:06.277 --> 00:59:10.179]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes,
[00:59:10.179 --> 00:59:10.860]  We're good to go!

[00:59:57.955 --> 00:59:59.036]  We're good to go.
[01:00:39.565 --> 01:00:45.171]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have identified the private film reserve as the enemy of the Republic.
[01:00:45.992 --> 01:00:47.513]  The beginning of the end is here.
[01:00:47.593 --> 01:00:49.315]  Keep rolling it for everybody out there.
[01:00:50.536 --> 01:00:52.438]  You take my life, but I take yours too.
[01:00:52.518 --> 01:00:54.740]  You fire musket, but I run you through.
[01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:08.175]  All right ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:01:08.755 --> 01:01:10.178]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:01:10.218 --> 01:01:11.700]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:15.326]  I want to play a few clips here of the grilling.
[01:01:17.444 --> 01:01:23.008]  of Ben Bernanke and others yesterday as the truth of what these guys have done.
[01:01:23.328 --> 01:01:34.536]  These are the same bankers who changed the policies and when the government wouldn't give them unlimited trillions last October, they went out on the news and said we're going to have martial law, depression if you don't do this.
[01:01:34.856 --> 01:01:36.737]  The market dropped several thousand points.
[01:01:37.218 --> 01:01:38.959]  The government panicked, passed it.
[01:01:39.319 --> 01:01:41.701]  They stole the money and said we won't say where it went.
[01:01:42.734 --> 01:01:43.975]  Now they want even more money.
[01:01:44.395 --> 01:01:47.037]  These are the made-off Kinley type criminals.
[01:01:47.438 --> 01:01:48.779]  This is the criminal group.
[01:01:48.859 --> 01:01:55.044]  These are the illegitimate people that run our country and run our government and are running it into the ground.
[01:01:56.161 --> 01:02:01.504]  And so I want to go ahead and play a short clip with Judge Napolitano yesterday.
[01:02:01.524 --> 01:02:09.528]  And there's hours of this where Republicans and Democrats said, we want you gone, Bernanke.
[01:02:09.568 --> 01:02:13.351]  But, you know, they're throwing Phil Jones under the bus for climate fraud.
[01:02:13.391 --> 01:02:17.493]  He's only the kingpin of the scientists, low level compared to Al Gore and George Soros.
[01:02:17.853 --> 01:02:18.974]  They're throwing him under the bus.
[01:02:19.554 --> 01:02:21.695]  They're trying to throw Bernanke under the bus.
[01:02:21.795 --> 01:02:23.116]  No, it's not going to end there.
[01:02:23.476 --> 01:02:26.078]  You can't just give the public a sacrificial hog.
[01:02:26.738 --> 01:02:27.119]  Okay?
[01:02:27.859 --> 01:02:28.700]  We want them all.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:32.722]  We're going to talk about that with Bob Chapman here in just a moment.
[01:02:32.762 --> 01:02:35.544]  But first, here is Judge Napolitano.
[01:02:42.128 --> 01:02:43.729]  Go ahead and play it whenever you guys are
[01:02:45.905 --> 01:02:47.746]  Okay, I thought we had that saved to computer.
[01:02:47.826 --> 01:02:48.406]  Well, okay.
[01:02:48.846 --> 01:02:51.108]  Man, these computers are just having a meltdown in there lately.
[01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:52.028]  Nothing's working.
[01:02:52.448 --> 01:02:54.769]  It used to like always work and now it doesn't.
[01:02:55.770 --> 01:03:00.632]  Do you, you know, I think we have too many videos loaded in on that system.
[01:03:01.433 --> 01:03:05.455]  And so we're going to have to go to something else here because this is just not working live on radio.
[01:03:06.495 --> 01:03:07.856]  Not, not, not working at all.
[01:03:09.517 --> 01:03:11.478]  What about the other clip we've got from the hearings?
[01:03:11.498 --> 01:03:11.998]  Do you have that?
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.780]  From that Asian news channel?
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.221]  Okay, we'll play whatever we can.
[01:03:16.261 --> 01:03:16.561]  Here we go.
[01:03:16.581 --> 01:03:29.024]  A term at the helm of the Central Bank expires next month faced unusually blunt talk from lawmakers critical of the Fed's actions during the crisis.
[01:03:29.444 --> 01:03:32.325]  Senator Jim Bunning is a Republican from Kentucky.
[01:03:32.525 --> 01:03:40.627]  You put the printing presses into overdrive to fund the government spending and hand out cheap money to your masters on Wall Street.
[01:03:41.553 --> 01:03:51.185]  Which they use to rake in record profits while ordinary Americans and small businesses can't even get loans for their everyday needs.
[01:03:51.845 --> 01:04:00.436]  But in a forceful defense of the Fed's efforts during the crisis, many of them unprecedented, Bernanke said authorities prevented a calamity.
[01:04:01.147 --> 01:04:14.917]  As severe as the effects of the financial crisis have been, however, the outcome could have been markedly worse without the strong actions taken by the Congress, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and other authorities both here and abroad.
[01:04:15.758 --> 01:04:19.341]  He also said the economy appears to be on demand.
[01:04:20.161 --> 01:04:25.706]  Today, most indicators suggest that financial markets are stabilizing and that the economy is emerging from the recession.
[01:04:26.786 --> 01:04:28.688]  Yet our task is far from complete.
[01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:38.755]  Far too many Americans are without jobs and unemployment could remain high for some time, even if, as we anticipate, moderate economic growth continues.
[01:04:39.196 --> 01:04:43.859]  Despite the tough questioning, a second term for Bernanke does not appear in doubt.
[01:04:46.521 --> 01:04:54.146]  Okay, and then we're going to try this other clip one more time here, where there's some other grilling that goes on.
[01:04:54.887 --> 01:04:55.407]  Here it is.
[01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.830]  Done right.
[01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:01.898]  Some members of the Senate Banking Committee.
[01:05:02.178 --> 01:05:11.981]  Bernanke wants that second term as head of the Federal Reserve, but Republican Senator Jim Bunning called him, quote, a moral hazard, and then added this.
[01:05:13.802 --> 01:05:17.263]  Where I come from, we punish failure, not reward it.
[01:05:18.163 --> 01:05:25.266]  That is certainly the way it was when I played baseball, and it is the way across all America presently.
[01:05:26.445 --> 01:05:34.971]  Judging by the current Treasurer's Secretary, some may think Washington does reward failure, but that should not be the case.
[01:05:36.112 --> 01:05:43.397]  I will do everything I can to stop your nomination and drag out this process as long as I can.
[01:05:44.096 --> 01:05:51.324]  Now Independent and Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has threatened to put a hold on Ben Bernanke's nomination.
[01:05:51.405 --> 01:05:51.905]  Let's see.
[01:05:51.925 --> 01:05:56.891]  A conservative and a socialist agree on at least one thing.
[01:05:57.532 --> 01:05:59.674]  No more Bernanke.
[01:06:00.595 --> 01:06:05.219]  With me now, no fan of the Fed, Congressman Ron Paul of Texas.
[01:06:05.759 --> 01:06:14.145]  Okay, so there's a few minutes of that, and you can just go to YouTube and type in Bernanke Grilled, and there's just hundreds of these in the last few months.
[01:06:14.546 --> 01:06:28.116]  They've gone from treating him with reverence and shaking when he comes in, oh Federal Reserve, oh you are the god of our country, thank you for all you do, now to hey, you're a bunch of crooks, we know you engineered this, we know you gave the money to yourself, you need to get in trouble.
[01:06:28.536 --> 01:06:28.977]  And now,
[01:06:31.072 --> 01:06:31.993]  311 sponsors.
[01:06:32.053 --> 01:06:33.953]  It's passed out a committee to audit the Fed.
[01:06:33.993 --> 01:06:35.414]  A strong bill to audit the Fed.
[01:06:35.554 --> 01:06:38.855]  Auditing the Fed, as Bernanke has said, will destroy the Fed.
[01:06:39.176 --> 01:06:41.296]  It's a private holding company for the big central banks.
[01:06:41.737 --> 01:06:52.401]  Bob Chapman, for those that may have just joined us, explain to people what the Federal Reserve is, how big this is, that we have 80 plus percent of Americans in some polls wanting to abolish or audit the Fed.
[01:06:52.921 --> 01:07:00.268]  We have a new poll out, just 21% from Rasmussen, favor Bernanke's reappointment as Fed Chairman.
[01:07:00.508 --> 01:07:01.909]  But it's not just Bernanke.
[01:07:01.929 --> 01:07:03.130]  It's like shark teeth.
[01:07:03.551 --> 01:07:05.893]  You pull out one tooth, another tooth rolls forward.
[01:07:06.133 --> 01:07:10.877]  We have to get rid of the shark itself, the private Federal Reserve banking dictatorship, don't we?
[01:07:12.058 --> 01:07:14.701]  We certainly do, and I think we're well on our way to doing that.
[01:07:15.689 --> 01:07:27.035]  And you know there's about 310 to 311 co-sponsors of the House bill and it certainly looks like it's going to pass and after the grilling that went on
[01:07:27.697 --> 01:07:38.743]  And the exposure that got right down to the nitty-gritty of what was going on is going to throw this thing forward to be passed, and I think it'll be passed in the Senate.
[01:07:39.364 --> 01:07:46.868]  And I think we'll have a hard look at what goes on in the Fed, and the people aren't going to like it because it's been going on for 96 years.
[01:07:47.488 --> 01:07:52.391]  And when they look back and see all of these cycles, they were deliberately created.
[01:07:53.435 --> 01:08:02.519]  You know, maybe their predecessors at the Treasury Department during the 1870s and 80s and 90s and up until 1905 did a terrible job.
[01:08:03.399 --> 01:08:04.160]  Maybe they did.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.301]  But these guys have done a hell of a lot worse, let me tell you.
[01:08:08.121 --> 01:08:14.344]  And so, the Federal Reserve is privately owned, as Alex said, and there's 12 banks that own it.
[01:08:14.804 --> 01:08:18.546]  And then they have the top shareholders who have held the stock in the Fed
[01:08:19.604 --> 01:08:36.198]  Since 1913 and they are American and European bankers and the core, the very heart, the nexus of what goes on within the power behind government emanates from the Fed.
[01:08:37.018 --> 01:08:44.084]  This is the handmaiden of control of our entire country, our economy, our foreign policy.
[01:08:44.896 --> 01:08:51.779]  They control Congress through campaign contributions from both, you know, both parties are involved.
[01:08:51.799 --> 01:08:54.300]  It isn't a Democrat or Republican thing.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.381]  It's both of them.
[01:08:56.341 --> 01:09:00.823]  And I'm glad to see that Bernie was involved.
[01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:08.506]  And I like seeing socialists and conservatives together because, like you say, Alex, it throws out the left-right paradigm.
[01:09:08.886 --> 01:09:12.908]  Let's do what's good for America and we'll sort all the other stuff out later.
[01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:15.611]  And so that's where we're headed with this thing.
[01:09:15.971 --> 01:09:17.152]  Well, Bob, here's the problem.
[01:09:17.872 --> 01:09:29.662]  Like they did last October and like they've done in the last month, the private Fed chairman, the Treasury head, they come out and threaten and say if you try to audit the Fed, that will cause the economy to implode.
[01:09:30.363 --> 01:09:32.745]  If you don't give us more money, the economy will implode.
[01:09:33.812 --> 01:09:43.616]  And it's just like one of the professors says in Follow the Republic, this is like the end of Blazing Saddles where they have the sheriff surrounded, the corrupt sheriff, and he puts a gun to his head and says, stop or I'll shoot.
[01:09:44.476 --> 01:09:46.317]  This is like suicide by cop.
[01:09:46.957 --> 01:09:51.159]  They're saying, you do what we say or we will destroy the economy.
[01:09:51.459 --> 01:09:55.641]  But we do what they say and they destroy the economy because they want to consolidate it.
[01:09:55.961 --> 01:09:57.862]  I mean, this is not going to be clean.
[01:09:58.182 --> 01:09:59.362]  This is going to be messy.
[01:09:59.402 --> 01:10:00.743]  But the beginning of the end,
[01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:18.759]  For these people has begun because now we've gone from 10 years ago maybe 1 out of 20 people knowing the Fed was the real government, the shadow government, to now over 80% knowing it's the real government and so they're not addressing puppet Obama, puppet Bush, puppet McCain, puppet Pelosi.
[01:10:19.019 --> 01:10:20.781]  They're addressing the real government.
[01:10:21.121 --> 01:10:22.923]  We're having a real dialogue now.
[01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:28.062]  You know, we're attacking the real core of what's going on.
[01:10:28.662 --> 01:10:34.183]  And all of the peripheral things that you've just mentioned are secondary in importance.
[01:10:34.983 --> 01:10:48.846]  And so, I am amazed, amazed that this 80% of the people, and you know it shows up on the other side with the 21% who back Bernanke.
[01:10:49.406 --> 01:10:52.067]  I mean, that's 80% going the other way that don't.
[01:10:52.762 --> 01:11:01.571]  And so the public on this issue, from listening to your program and programs like it, and on the internet, they've gotten themselves educated.
[01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:10.279]  And very, very quickly, I think over the last two years, we've had this buildup of knowledge, which is fantastic.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.222]  And if we can shut down the Fed,
[01:11:14.463 --> 01:11:18.244]  And get the job back to the Treasury Department in whatever form they want.
[01:11:18.605 --> 01:11:23.146]  And get rid of private bankers, private Fed representatives in the Treasury.
[01:11:24.227 --> 01:11:30.809]  I was just going to say, we've got to stop the revolving door between Wall Street and the Treasury Department.
[01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:36.051]  We do those two things and we resurrect Andrew Jackson and we get it made.
[01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:43.935]  But, this crew is going to stage terror attacks, wars, martial law before they let us do it.
[01:11:44.115 --> 01:11:50.219]  But, since the people are now awake to all of that, it's only a matter of time before these people fall.
[01:11:50.259 --> 01:11:53.361]  I mean, that's why they would never say the Federal Reserve was private.
[01:11:53.701 --> 01:11:57.324]  That's why we would read official UN documents calling for world government.
[01:11:57.544 --> 01:11:59.505]  The media would say we were nuts it didn't exist.
[01:11:59.925 --> 01:12:04.428]  Because they could never admit that there was an illegitimate shadow global corporate government.
[01:12:04.869 --> 01:12:07.871]  Because then people would stop being distracted by the puppets
[01:12:08.371 --> 01:12:19.759]  And actually start having a debate about the real power structure, and now people know there's a global government, now that it's admitted we're going into world government, now more and more whistleblowers are coming out, exposing them.
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:27.084]  I mean, we've got a long, hard road to follow here, but at the end of it, we're going to beat these people.
[01:12:28.025 --> 01:12:29.946]  We are, and we're going to get our country back.
[01:12:30.687 --> 01:12:36.151]  And it is going to be nasty, and they do have the ability to take the economy down any time they feel like it.
[01:12:36.969 --> 01:12:40.230]  And so if we challenge them and they lose, they are going to take it down.
[01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:41.571]  But it's going to go down anyway.
[01:12:41.911 --> 01:12:43.632]  And it should have went down in the first place.
[01:12:44.192 --> 01:12:45.692]  That's classical economics.
[01:12:45.732 --> 01:12:51.615]  We don't stand around and allow the Fed Reserve or the likes of it to do what they've done.
[01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:54.076]  We take the economy down.
[01:12:54.256 --> 01:12:56.737]  In 1920-21, we had the same situation.
[01:12:57.677 --> 01:13:01.319]  And the president just walked away and said, look, let it take its course.
[01:13:01.459 --> 01:13:01.979]  And it did.
[01:13:02.499 --> 01:13:04.860]  And we were out of the recession in a year.
[01:13:05.413 --> 01:13:07.854]  And it boomed during the 20s, of course, too much.
[01:13:08.354 --> 01:13:10.454]  And then, of course, the Fed pulled the plug again.
[01:13:11.255 --> 01:13:12.475]  And this is all rigged.
[01:13:12.495 --> 01:13:20.317]  It's all contrived to make gazillions of dollars for these people and ensconce them greater, greater, greater power.
[01:13:22.178 --> 01:13:26.899]  But they've clearly overplayed their hand this time because resistance to them is just mounting.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.940]  Well, that's why we've got to keep on hammering on.
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.021]  And that's like with you, yourself and myself.
[01:13:34.922 --> 01:13:40.526]  We went, you know, hammer and tong after that climate gate and it was a tremendous issue.
[01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:47.551]  I mean, I'm getting on stations I would have never got on before Foxcom emailed me and asked me to go on.
[01:13:48.412 --> 01:13:56.358]  We had Rush and O'Reilly use tapes of mine from the shows that I've been on on the air.
[01:13:56.798 --> 01:14:00.821]  I mean, they're trying to capture the flavor of the thing so they can
[01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:04.319]  Continue to get their ratings, and the ratings aren't there for them.
[01:14:04.619 --> 01:14:06.140]  They're falling off in their ratings.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.601]  And that's why they're doing that.
[01:14:07.941 --> 01:14:09.802]  And Alex, you pointed that out before.
[01:14:11.263 --> 01:14:12.424]  Well, absolutely.
[01:14:12.464 --> 01:14:30.855]  The founder of the Tea Party, the guy that actually started it to be non-partisan, anti-Federal Reserve, he went on Fox, of all places, and said, Glenn Beck and the fake Republicans have hijacked our movement, and so... And then Jesse Ventura's new TV show gets the highest ratings true TV's ever had.
[01:14:32.782 --> 01:14:33.282]  And it should.
[01:14:34.682 --> 01:14:36.703]  All Jesse's doing is saying, hey, look at this.
[01:14:36.743 --> 01:14:37.483]  This is the truth.
[01:14:37.503 --> 01:14:38.463]  This is the way it is.
[01:14:38.883 --> 01:14:40.704]  And this is all the people want.
[01:14:41.264 --> 01:14:43.944]  Tell us the truth and which direction we should go.
[01:14:46.225 --> 01:14:50.626]  Well, folks, there are some positive things happening, but we're not out of the woods yet, as they say.
[01:14:50.646 --> 01:14:55.067]  The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but we've got miles to go before we sleep.
[01:14:56.707 --> 01:14:58.427]  In fact, somebody pull up that poem for me.
[01:14:58.647 --> 01:15:01.548]  The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have miles to go before I sleep.
[01:15:01.568 --> 01:15:02.628]  I want to read that poem later.
[01:15:03.849 --> 01:15:05.009]  Bob, I want to take some calls.
[01:15:05.029 --> 01:15:07.970]  They're all over the map from earlier, but you can comment on any issue.
[01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:09.970]  Let's talk to Jake in California.
[01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:10.810]  Jake, you're on the air.
[01:15:11.911 --> 01:15:12.291]  Hey, man.
[01:15:13.231 --> 01:15:14.991]  I'm enjoying the program this morning.
[01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:17.392]  I just wanted to say hi.
[01:15:17.432 --> 01:15:21.793]  I've got a friend in northern Mississippi that listens to you regularly, Susie Q. Anyhow,
[01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:30.295]  Um, let me just say, uh, first of all, I wanted to make a comment on what you guys just said regarding the economy, but Alex, I'd like to make a request.
[01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:35.179]  Would you please have Dr. Deagle on sometime in the near future to discuss?
[01:15:35.739 --> 01:15:36.960]  You got to make your point, sir.
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.621]  I go ahead and make your point.
[01:15:39.022 --> 01:15:39.302]  Okay.
[01:15:39.322 --> 01:15:44.666]  Well, the point I wanted to make is I completely disagree with what you guys just said that we're going to get this country back.
[01:15:45.427 --> 01:15:47.268]  Literally, that would take a miracle.
[01:15:47.448 --> 01:15:48.469]  That's not going to be us.
[01:15:48.529 --> 01:15:49.490]  It's going to be a miracle.
[01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.171]  There is a course that's been set.
[01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:54.243]  You actually have been a proponent of that.
[01:15:54.823 --> 01:15:56.145]  You've been speaking about it.
[01:15:56.665 --> 01:15:59.347]  And so we don't just have some miraculous turnaround.
[01:15:59.367 --> 01:15:59.988]  Wow.
[01:16:00.008 --> 01:16:02.970]  I mean, this is a really defeatist phone call here, Jack.
[01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:06.793]  No, it's not a defeatist phone call.
[01:16:06.913 --> 01:16:08.855]  What it is, is it's a realistic phone call.
[01:16:08.895 --> 01:16:12.277]  And a lot of it is based on the data that you've passed in the past.
[01:16:13.779 --> 01:16:19.143]  So, I mean, when you pass data to us and tell us that, you know, basically,
[01:16:19.813 --> 01:16:21.978]  We're in an enormous amount of trouble, which is true.
[01:16:22.118 --> 01:16:22.880]  We can see that.
[01:16:23.381 --> 01:16:26.709]  And then in the next breath to say, we're going to win this thing, we're not.
[01:16:28.123 --> 01:16:28.784]  Listen, listen.
[01:16:29.004 --> 01:16:30.344]  You got the wrong show then, bro.
[01:16:30.565 --> 01:16:30.805]  Okay?
[01:16:31.645 --> 01:16:33.266]  You've got the wrong radio show.
[01:16:33.326 --> 01:16:37.028]  Since we're not going to beat anything, go out and party and have a great time.
[01:16:37.108 --> 01:16:37.348]  Okay?
[01:16:37.368 --> 01:16:38.308]  You got the wrong show.
[01:16:38.889 --> 01:16:41.730]  The climate gate is devastating and Copenhagen is going to fail.
[01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:44.451]  They're still going to try to implement all this at the grassroots level.
[01:16:44.791 --> 01:16:52.215]  We've got to go out with a winning attitude and engage these people at the local level and take our communities back by standing up against them.
[01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:53.696]  The Federal Reserve.
[01:16:54.963 --> 01:16:57.266]  We just pointed out all the stuff they're going to try to pull on us.
[01:16:57.886 --> 01:17:01.711]  But the beginning of the end is happening for them.
[01:17:02.532 --> 01:17:08.879]  And, I mean, I just don't even know what to say or I'm bad for saying we can win this thing.
[01:17:09.813 --> 01:17:10.693]  This is a process.
[01:17:10.753 --> 01:17:12.074]  It's not going to happen overnight.
[01:17:12.134 --> 01:17:13.694]  But we have to reach out to people.
[01:17:14.054 --> 01:17:15.375]  We've got to get involved.
[01:17:16.235 --> 01:17:17.195]  And I know history.
[01:17:17.575 --> 01:17:19.296]  And I know the situation we're facing.
[01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:21.576]  And I know we've got a chance to reverse this.
[01:17:22.376 --> 01:17:25.177]  Bob, I want to get your take on that call when we come back.
[01:17:26.218 --> 01:17:27.278]  I mean, I just...
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:37.543]  People don't understand what attitude is about, and initiative, and knowing we're in the right, and standing up and saying we're gonna win.
[01:17:37.563 --> 01:17:39.464]  They don't understand warfare.
[01:17:39.484 --> 01:17:41.004]  They don't understand info war.
[01:17:41.024 --> 01:17:42.605]  They don't understand we've got the truth.
[01:17:42.925 --> 01:17:44.686]  We've got the ultimate weapon on our side.
[01:17:44.946 --> 01:17:47.667]  They don't understand that the enemy is imploding at every level.
[01:17:48.147 --> 01:17:49.168]  Man, that makes me sick.
[01:17:51.058 --> 01:17:55.319]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:03.222]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.
[01:18:03.462 --> 01:18:18.267]  The revolutionary Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.
[01:18:18.567 --> 01:18:23.190]  Order the Berkey light system today, complete with two black Berkey elements for only two hundred and nine dollars.
[01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:27.873]  And the Berkey guy will include three sport Berkey water bottles and ship everything to you free of charge.
[01:18:28.093 --> 01:18:28.573]  That's right.
[01:18:28.753 --> 01:18:34.757]  Three sport Berkey water bottles and free shipping and eighty seven dollar value yours free, but only for a limited time.
[01:18:35.017 --> 01:18:37.078]  Just call the Berkey guy at 1 8 7 7 8 8 6 36 53 now to order.
[01:18:37.098 --> 01:18:38.880]  That's 1 8 7 7 8 8 6 36 53 or order online now at go Berkey
[01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:55.339]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:58.707]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:18:58.948 --> 01:19:00.351]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:19:01.064 --> 01:19:03.747]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:19:04.487 --> 01:19:09.952]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:19:10.113 --> 01:19:15.157]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:19:15.318 --> 01:19:25.307]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:19:25.407 --> 01:19:27.509]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:19:27.769 --> 01:19:29.090]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:31.632]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:19:31.812 --> 01:19:33.653]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:19:33.933 --> 01:19:38.737]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:19:39.077 --> 01:19:48.204]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:56.681 --> 01:20:07.708]  Aerial spraying, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[01:20:08.428 --> 01:20:10.949]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:19.194]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:20:21.215 --> 01:20:25.378]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[01:20:25.925 --> 01:20:29.127]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[01:20:29.807 --> 01:20:33.149]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[01:20:33.710 --> 01:20:38.353]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long-term storage.
[01:20:38.853 --> 01:20:42.015]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today.
[01:20:56.294 --> 01:20:58.556]  Look, I'm going to get Bob's take on what we just heard.
[01:20:58.576 --> 01:21:01.218]  But first I just want to say this.
[01:21:02.759 --> 01:21:19.632]  We have gotten into this position where we've been taken over and usurped by foreign offshore banks and corporations because we got an attitude that we're the biggest, we're the best, there's no corruption in government, I can just go play golf all day and never care about who's getting elected or never care about what's happening with special interests.
[01:21:20.012 --> 01:21:20.912]  I can just go to sleep.
[01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:24.554]  And I know that if we have that attitude, things are only going to get worse.
[01:21:24.914 --> 01:21:27.235]  We are having successes that are so giant.
[01:21:27.575 --> 01:21:31.597]  The spirit in this country and the world is shifting and awakening.
[01:21:32.417 --> 01:21:33.237]  I'm seeing it.
[01:21:34.238 --> 01:21:41.921]  Everywhere I go, in foreign countries and other cities, masses of people come up to Alex Jones on the street and say, we're awake, we're fighting.
[01:21:42.321 --> 01:21:43.241]  And I'm just one guy.
[01:21:43.281 --> 01:21:50.504]  So you may not have a face they recognize, the caller from California, Dave, and so you may think,
[01:21:51.204 --> 01:21:58.486]  That I'm blowing smoke, and you may see decadent, soulless people around you who aren't awake and think we're doomed.
[01:21:59.166 --> 01:22:04.048]  I know we're in a lot better position than we were a year ago, two years ago, ten years ago.
[01:22:04.348 --> 01:22:06.169]  Bob Chapman's been doing this for almost 50 years.
[01:22:07.569 --> 01:22:11.350]  Okay, he's an icon in fighting the New World Order and he doesn't have a loser attitude.
[01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:19.672]  And I'm not calling you a loser, sir, but I don't need to be rebuked for getting up here and saying, things are really bad, these people are really bad.
[01:22:19.712 --> 01:22:22.672]  That's like if your house is on fire and I go, call the fire department, it's on fire.
[01:22:22.912 --> 01:22:24.673]  I'm not being negative, I'm telling you the truth.
[01:22:25.293 --> 01:22:30.654]  But the fire department pulled up, they put out fires in a couple rooms, looks like we're going to be able to save the house.
[01:22:31.454 --> 01:22:34.635]  If you'll stop telling the firemen to stand down.
[01:22:37.145 --> 01:22:38.846]  They told the Founding Fathers they couldn't win.
[01:22:38.886 --> 01:22:40.687]  They've told everybody they couldn't win.
[01:22:40.707 --> 01:22:42.568]  They've told inventors they couldn't invent things.
[01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:50.092]  It is an attitude, a loser attitude, that we have going on here that we've got to route out.
[01:22:50.392 --> 01:22:52.974]  We have to go look at these criminals in government,
[01:22:53.314 --> 01:23:02.087]  Beat the drum that they're criminals, expose their system, and they will fall because they've triggered criminal operations that are going to hurt people financially.
[01:23:02.327 --> 01:23:09.036]  And so even lazy, decadent people are now looking for the truth and rubbing the sleep out of their eyes and getting awake and getting involved.
[01:23:09.717 --> 01:23:15.183]  And it is a lie to say that there's no way to stand up against this or to stop this.
[01:23:15.583 --> 01:23:17.305]  Look at what's happening.
[01:23:17.565 --> 01:23:19.327]  Every time we stand up, we win.
[01:23:19.647 --> 01:23:26.574]  The problem is most of the time people don't stand up because they don't have any respect for themselves in this fight.
[01:23:26.974 --> 01:23:27.615]  Bob Chapman.
[01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:32.340]  I agree, but I think it's good to have the dialogue and have the other
[01:23:33.331 --> 01:23:37.512]  side, like the gentleman said, I don't believe it.
[01:23:37.672 --> 01:23:38.813]  I don't think it's going to work.
[01:23:39.313 --> 01:23:40.593]  He understands the problem.
[01:23:40.613 --> 01:23:41.354]  He said he did.
[01:23:42.194 --> 01:23:45.235]  And his take, you said, is incorrect.
[01:23:45.295 --> 01:23:46.575]  I agree with you.
[01:23:46.595 --> 01:23:48.796]  And it is incorrect.
[01:23:49.236 --> 01:24:01.020]  And the key word, and you mentioned it just a minute or two ago, is we know what the problem is, and we have to have the spirit of American citizens in our country
[01:24:01.778 --> 01:24:04.160]  And we have to go forward and stop these people.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:19.812]  And better we should go forward and be defeated than not go forward at all and just give up and give these people world government and world tyranny and we become vassals of some vast state.
[01:24:20.592 --> 01:24:23.975]  We've got to stop them here and we've got to make sure they don't do it again.
[01:24:24.853 --> 01:24:42.843]  And that spirit, it's just like a sports team goes out, they're going to have interaction with another team, no matter what the sport, and you all talk together and say, look, we know these other guys or these other gals are really good, but we get the spirit and we really want to win this game and we're going to do it.
[01:24:44.361 --> 01:24:48.844]  And then you look at the fact that the globalists are a bunch of pot-bellied, wicked, corrupt people.
[01:24:49.304 --> 01:24:51.745]  Sure, they've got the money and the power, but it's all fraudulent.
[01:24:52.205 --> 01:25:10.495]  If you really look at the strength of the people, we're like a million feet tall, weigh six trillion pounds, and they're a 125-pound pot-bellied goblin that's gotten up there full of arrogance and chutzpah or whatever and beat its chest and told us we're beaten, told us that we can't win.
[01:25:11.676 --> 01:25:19.981]  I mean, when they were dropping A-bombs on Tokyo, or on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Imperial Japanese were broadcasting, we'd lost the war.
[01:25:20.322 --> 01:25:23.984]  It's like Baghdad Bob getting up there and saying that the U.S.
[01:25:24.024 --> 01:25:26.826]  had lost as explosions were going off behind him.
[01:25:27.026 --> 01:25:28.327]  It's a crock of baloney!
[01:25:28.507 --> 01:25:29.387]  We'll be right back.
[01:25:32.329 --> 01:25:35.711]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:25:35.731 --> 01:25:37.132]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:25:40.868 --> 01:25:43.470]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:48.833]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:25:49.193 --> 01:25:50.934]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:25:51.254 --> 01:25:56.057]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:25:56.238 --> 01:25:57.218]  How much do you want?
[01:25:57.438 --> 01:25:58.179]  When do you want it?
[01:25:58.559 --> 01:26:00.160]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.261]  When will you need it?
[01:26:01.521 --> 01:26:03.582]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:26:03.722 --> 01:26:04.823]  Will there be any food?
[01:26:05.063 --> 01:26:06.364]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:26:06.584 --> 01:26:11.645]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:26:11.825 --> 01:26:15.046]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:26:15.427 --> 01:26:18.928]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:26:19.228 --> 01:26:20.228]  How much will you need?
[01:26:20.468 --> 01:26:21.088]  We don't know.
[01:26:21.368 --> 01:26:22.288]  How much do you want?
[01:26:22.469 --> 01:26:23.189]  All you can get.
[01:26:23.209 --> 01:26:24.089]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:26:24.489 --> 01:26:27.252]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:26:27.552 --> 01:26:29.734]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:26:29.754 --> 01:26:30.735]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:26:30.755 --> 01:26:31.896]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:31.916 --> 01:26:33.778]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:57.436 --> 01:27:00.676]  Stopping by the woods on a snowy evening, Robert Frost.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.201]  Whose woods these are, I think I know.
[01:27:04.221 --> 01:27:06.483]  His house is in the village, though.
[01:27:07.143 --> 01:27:12.006]  He will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow.
[01:27:12.546 --> 01:27:22.793]  My little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near, between the woods and frozen lake, the darkest evening of the year.
[01:27:23.573 --> 01:27:29.257]  He gives his little harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake.
[01:27:30.097 --> 01:27:36.323]  The only other sounds the sweep of easy wind and downy flake.
[01:27:37.184 --> 01:27:46.872]  The woods are lovely dark and deep but I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep and miles to go before I sleep.
[01:27:49.715 --> 01:27:51.516]  Nice little wintertime poem.
[01:27:52.217 --> 01:27:56.241]  I wish I was in the woods riding a horse but I gotta be right here fighting the new world order.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:19.876]  You know, if people would just go to their city councils, their county commissioners, their state houses, confront them, speak out, go to public events, call into talk radio, call Congress, go and confront the land grabbers, go and confront the CPS, stand up for your rights, demonstrate, rally so they can't ban it, go to public events, confront globalists.
[01:28:19.896 --> 01:28:28.323]  I mean, Al Gore is canceling much of his speaking tours because everywhere he goes he's being protested and that's making it in the newspaper and he looks bad.
[01:28:28.743 --> 01:28:30.423]  These people don't have total control.
[01:28:30.824 --> 01:28:46.728]  So many people that serve the system, serve it because they think we're kooks, because they were told we were kooks by the media, but now because of people 20, 30, 40 years ago telling the truth, everybody heard the truth, so now that it's been proven to be the truth, people are ready to wake up.
[01:28:47.108 --> 01:28:51.292]  What is it that that caller can't understand about that, Bob?
[01:28:51.512 --> 01:28:55.175]  He isn't rejoicing at all the successes we're having.
[01:28:55.376 --> 01:28:58.839]  He isn't rejoicing at the enemy in retreat on multi fronts.
[01:28:59.419 --> 01:29:00.981]  Every time we fight, we win.
[01:29:01.201 --> 01:29:04.324]  But how do we get the people to stand up, Bob?
[01:29:05.625 --> 01:29:12.411]  By telling them the truth and continuing to cite all of the instances that you brought up today about
[01:29:13.365 --> 01:29:27.330]  Cap and Trade and the scandal in Climategate and the power of what's going on in Congress with the Fed Reserve and the eminent passage of Ron Paul's 1207 and the 604 in the Senate.
[01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:29.890]  All these are very positive things.
[01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:35.372]  We're showing people that all the things that they suspected are really going on.
[01:29:36.133 --> 01:29:40.514]  And the reason we couldn't find out is everything is behind closed doors.
[01:29:41.107 --> 01:29:45.450]  You know, Alex, you and I, we back into a lot of things.
[01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:48.331]  Because we can't get the information sometimes.
[01:29:48.992 --> 01:29:54.515]  And you put the puzzle together, and all of a sudden you've discovered, well, that's what they're doing.
[01:29:55.275 --> 01:29:57.437]  And most people don't want to bother to do that.
[01:29:57.457 --> 01:30:01.819]  They'd rather throw their hands in the air than live in an internment camp.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:04.341]  And evidently that's what that fellow would like to do.
[01:30:04.884 --> 01:30:09.245]  And on top of that, we're going to come back and take calls, I promise, for John, Alan, Mike, Scott, and others.
[01:30:09.946 --> 01:30:11.706]  We get internal congressional reports.
[01:30:11.726 --> 01:30:13.347]  We get internal ADL reports.
[01:30:13.887 --> 01:30:16.848]  We get internal reports from the big think tanks.
[01:30:17.528 --> 01:30:20.489]  And look at all these emails from the top UN climate fraudsters.
[01:30:20.509 --> 01:30:23.070]  They're pulling their hair out, going, they're exposing us!
[01:30:23.290 --> 01:30:24.191]  How do we stop them?
[01:30:24.371 --> 01:30:25.231]  They may beat us!
[01:30:25.451 --> 01:30:26.751]  They're behind the scenes!
[01:30:26.791 --> 01:30:28.372]  They're just, haha, they're everywhere!
[01:30:28.592 --> 01:30:36.039]  They're waking up to us out in the public, they're like, we're winning, everything's fine, because they understand they've got to put that good face on their fraud.
[01:30:36.359 --> 01:30:39.402]  But when we come out and say we're starting to win, that's real!
[01:30:39.942 --> 01:30:41.824]  Folks, they're scared to death of us!
[01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.349]  Bob?
[01:30:48.369 --> 01:30:49.110]  And that's a fact.
[01:30:49.771 --> 01:30:50.611]  And that's a fact.
[01:30:51.272 --> 01:30:52.593]  I am just... It is, it is.
[01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:53.694]  I know these people.
[01:30:53.814 --> 01:30:55.636]  I've debated them just like you have.
[01:30:56.411 --> 01:31:00.655]  And they don't want to talk about anything on the plane that we want to talk about.
[01:31:01.175 --> 01:31:02.636]  There's no open discussion.
[01:31:02.677 --> 01:31:09.502]  I mean, Ron Paul, for the first time in the last couple of weeks, got on major television, CNBC and things like that.
[01:31:10.403 --> 01:31:23.955]  They're now recognizing that the feeling of disenchantment by the public is so great that they have to use more propaganda and face up to the fact that there is opposition, just like the gentleman that called in.
[01:31:25.095 --> 01:31:28.756]  He's in opposition to trying to win, evidently.
[01:31:29.376 --> 01:31:33.097]  And these people, they want to hold on to what they've got.
[01:31:33.197 --> 01:31:37.699]  This power, this enormous amount of money that controls the people.
[01:31:38.399 --> 01:31:46.161]  Well, Bob, there's also a lot of people that expect we're going to lose and can't believe anything ever positive is going to happen.
[01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:49.142]  But the globalists are just criminals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.167]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:55.307 --> 01:31:59.673]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:59.833 --> 01:32:01.696]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?

[01:33:49.656 --> 01:33:53.878]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:33:54.198 --> 01:33:54.818]  Number one.
[01:33:55.118 --> 01:33:58.279]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:33:58.540 --> 01:33:59.120]  Number two.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:03.962]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:34:04.282 --> 01:34:04.742]  It's true.
[01:34:05.042 --> 01:34:09.584]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:34:09.904 --> 01:34:10.445]  Number 3.
[01:34:10.725 --> 01:34:13.987]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:34:14.308 --> 01:34:18.030]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:34:18.231 --> 01:34:18.771]  Number 4.
[01:34:19.031 --> 01:34:21.393]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:34:21.793 --> 01:34:25.176]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:34:25.456 --> 01:34:25.676]  Number 5.
[01:34:26.257 --> 01:34:30.180]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:35.164]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:34:35.444 --> 01:34:39.467]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:34:46.253 --> 01:34:55.541]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:55.861 --> 01:34:58.183]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:34:58.203 --> 01:35:03.508]  Alright, going back to your calls, my final point on the
[01:35:04.884 --> 01:35:07.366]  Loser spirit that some people still have out there.
[01:35:07.386 --> 01:35:09.748]  The sense of defeatism.
[01:35:10.468 --> 01:35:12.049]  The globalists are slick criminals.
[01:35:12.490 --> 01:35:22.777]  And they're good at feeding on people that don't have a lot of information, people that are lazy, people that are weak, people that go along to get along, people that buy into slick corporate hype.
[01:35:25.559 --> 01:35:32.624]  But the globalists are threatened by strong, focused men and women that know the truth and will warn the people.
[01:35:32.744 --> 01:35:33.244]  And now,
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.960]  Every time we stand up, we win.
[01:35:36.301 --> 01:35:38.401]  The problem is we can't get people to stand up.
[01:35:38.761 --> 01:35:40.322]  People don't see themselves as leaders.
[01:35:40.362 --> 01:35:44.183]  I get thousands of emails every month saying, oh, we're glad you're there doing the job.
[01:35:44.283 --> 01:35:47.404]  No, folks, I'm just one person in this fight.
[01:35:47.824 --> 01:35:54.006]  That's what's so beautiful about We Are Change and the Tea Parties and other groups that are out confronting Gore and all these other globalists everywhere they go.
[01:35:54.346 --> 01:35:56.646]  People should be confronting Schwarzenegger everywhere he goes.
[01:35:56.666 --> 01:36:01.628]  They should be confronting all these other climate change fraudsters like Newt Gingrich.
[01:36:02.788 --> 01:36:03.789]  It's on both parties.
[01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:14.563]  And the left-right paradigm, where they divide us into two parties and make us fight with each other, and make us think the power structure ends with the president, that mirage is coming crashing down right now.
[01:36:14.804 --> 01:36:17.807]  So the media plays up these gate crashers for a week and a half.
[01:36:18.348 --> 01:36:18.588]  Hi Alex.
[01:36:18.628 --> 01:36:18.728]  Bob?
[01:36:18.748 --> 01:36:19.028]  Yes sir.
[01:36:48.698 --> 01:36:50.779]  One time I think he said that you knew Leon Degrell?
[01:36:52.259 --> 01:36:52.779]  Very well.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.120]  Could you explain a little bit about him?
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:58.861]  I read his book, Campaign in Russia, and the guy was really a brave soldier, really.
[01:36:59.121 --> 01:37:01.482]  It's really an excellent book on the war on the Eastern Front.
[01:37:01.942 --> 01:37:05.463]  I guess he said he told you a few things about World War II history and post-war Europe.
[01:37:05.503 --> 01:37:06.944]  I wonder if you could elaborate a bit on that?
[01:37:08.344 --> 01:37:15.526]  Well, I don't think this is the right time to do it, but Leon was a very well-read gentleman.
[01:37:16.507 --> 01:37:17.627]  He was an attorney.
[01:37:18.311 --> 01:37:20.673]  He was the head of the Rexis party in Belgium.
[01:37:21.673 --> 01:37:22.614]  He was a reporter.
[01:37:23.435 --> 01:37:27.838]  He was an eloquent speaker, although he never learned English.
[01:37:28.678 --> 01:37:32.261]  And we always had to converse in French or in German.
[01:37:33.142 --> 01:37:41.608]  And his exploits during the Second World War as a soldier were second to none in any army.
[01:37:42.428 --> 01:37:47.732]  And he was a survivor and he was a very nice man.
[01:37:49.545 --> 01:37:50.346]  All right, thanks a lot, Bob.
[01:37:52.507 --> 01:37:55.809]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Allen in Kentucky.
[01:37:55.949 --> 01:37:56.769]  Allen, you're on the air.
[01:37:56.829 --> 01:37:57.230]  Go ahead.
[01:37:58.470 --> 01:38:03.413]  Gentlemen, thank you very much for opening my eyes to so much.
[01:38:03.693 --> 01:38:09.617]  And I have so much anger at these people because I've had a very good life.
[01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:14.700]  I'm in my 60s, and I appreciate everything that this country has done and given to me.
[01:38:15.393 --> 01:38:21.855]  But I'm afraid that my children and my grandchildren are not going to have it as well as I did.
[01:38:21.915 --> 01:38:26.176]  So I'm one of these old fighters in this info war, Alex.
[01:38:26.736 --> 01:38:28.416]  I've bought many of your movies.
[01:38:28.496 --> 01:38:29.837]  I've made copies of them.
[01:38:30.457 --> 01:38:36.918]  And I want to tell those people out there who have this defeatist attitude, it's not going to happen.
[01:38:36.958 --> 01:38:39.399]  Things are going to probably get tougher than they are.
[01:38:40.099 --> 01:38:43.580]  I'm a little bit afraid now that as we push
[01:38:44.147 --> 01:38:51.610]  The New World Order into a corner, and I think we have pushed them into a corner, that they are going to become more desperate.
[01:38:52.090 --> 01:38:53.670]  But at least it's on our terms.
[01:38:53.710 --> 01:39:05.974]  How many years have I explained that when they announce their plan, there'd be a huge awakening, and it's not going to be all roses for these people, but at least we don't just lay here and let them carry it out the way they want.
[01:39:06.214 --> 01:39:07.575]  We make them escalate.
[01:39:07.815 --> 01:39:08.895]  We make them fight.
[01:39:09.135 --> 01:39:10.676]  We make them come out in the open.
[01:39:12.808 --> 01:39:22.516]  And because of you, Alex, we know their game plan, we know what they have in their repertoire, we know what the possibilities are, and we can prepare for that.
[01:39:22.997 --> 01:39:27.440]  And I do have one question that I'd like to get Bob's take on, if I may.
[01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:29.762]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:39:29.942 --> 01:39:41.652]  And all my life I've paid my taxes, and I've never cheated on my taxes, and yet I'm feeling very conflicted about that right now, since I know exactly where that money is going.
[01:39:42.225 --> 01:39:46.248]  And I think a lot of Americans are coming to that same conclusion.
[01:39:46.308 --> 01:39:49.610]  And I'm not advocating this to anybody.
[01:39:50.051 --> 01:39:59.858]  No, but record numbers are not paying now because they know, as Ronald Reagan's commission showed in 1981, not one red cent of your income tax money goes to run the country.
[01:39:59.878 --> 01:40:01.459]  It all goes to the private banks.
[01:40:01.499 --> 01:40:01.839]  Go ahead.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:07.643]  What would happen if a large number of us came to that same conclusion?
[01:40:08.664 --> 01:40:09.625]  That's what I'd like to know.
[01:40:10.866 --> 01:40:11.086]  Bob?
[01:40:12.145 --> 01:40:20.108]  I think historically, about 32% of people who own their own small businesses do not file at all.
[01:40:20.648 --> 01:40:23.369]  And that figure, I understand, has now risen to 38%.
[01:40:24.850 --> 01:40:29.912]  And if this thing keeps on going the way it's going, it's probably going to go up to 60 or 70%.
[01:40:31.752 --> 01:40:35.994]  And these people aren't captive because they own their own businesses.
[01:40:36.573 --> 01:40:42.257]  But there is a groundswell of people who are saying, no, I'm not going to do that anymore.
[01:40:42.698 --> 01:40:43.779]  And I'm not going to pay them.
[01:40:44.159 --> 01:40:45.200]  And there's millions of us.
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:51.765]  And so if I get caught and I have to go up against the government, well, I'm willing to do that.
[01:40:52.465 --> 01:40:53.466]  And that's what's happening.
[01:40:53.586 --> 01:40:57.449]  And I can understand why you're questioning what's going on.
[01:40:57.489 --> 01:40:58.870]  And it's a good time to do it.
[01:40:59.571 --> 01:41:03.634]  I mean, the people who work in companies, they don't have that luxury.
[01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:07.985]  They receive a paycheck, and they take everything out, and then they give you what's left.
[01:41:08.966 --> 01:41:13.307]  But private individuals who have their own companies, they're in a different situation.
[01:41:13.447 --> 01:41:14.488]  Yeah, I appreciate your call.
[01:41:14.528 --> 01:41:15.528]  Let me make this point.
[01:41:15.568 --> 01:41:17.128]  That's your decision to make.
[01:41:17.469 --> 01:41:20.990]  People are going, well, how do they fund the government if it isn't the income tax?
[01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:22.470]  It's all the hundreds of other taxes.
[01:41:22.530 --> 01:41:32.754]  And when you read what the UN says, and you read what the federal government has stated, they want a global carbon tax system that's going to be on an ID card with your carbon credits.
[01:41:33.274 --> 01:41:59.974]  And when those run out, more taxes will kick in, not just taxes on each item that's passed on to the manufacturing process or through transportation and at all the other points of all these taxes that are added, but they want it so they can track what you're buying, what you're doing, and the system under Homeland Security, and they've stated this, will be, you won't have a job, you won't get on a plane, you won't buy a gun, you won't be able to buy anything unless you're in good terms with the federal government.
[01:42:00.295 --> 01:42:01.556]  That's what the
[01:42:02.176 --> 01:42:02.656]  Absolutely.
[01:42:02.716 --> 01:42:06.218]  And this is part of world government, and that's what they're headed for.
[01:42:06.238 --> 01:42:09.499]  And all the defeatists out there are willing to accept that.
[01:42:25.732 --> 01:42:32.100]  Alex and I are not, and you aren't, and most of the audience isn't, and that's what we're going to continue to do.
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.121]  We're going to go after them.
[01:42:33.582 --> 01:42:35.284]  We won't wait for them to come to us.
[01:42:35.784 --> 01:42:38.508]  We're going to engage them, and we're going to attack them.
[01:42:39.208 --> 01:42:40.150]  And you know something?
[01:42:40.410 --> 01:42:41.291]  We're going to conquer them.
[01:42:43.632 --> 01:42:48.193]  Let's go, because see, once the system is fully discredited, they stage terror attacks, it won't work.
[01:42:48.293 --> 01:42:49.773]  They start new wars, it won't work.
[01:42:50.333 --> 01:42:57.055]  I mean, they're getting so discredited that when they attack myself and others now, people go, oh, Alex must be good, they're attacking him.
[01:42:57.395 --> 01:43:01.816]  I mean, there's a certain point where people don't buy anything they say or do.
[01:43:02.156 --> 01:43:03.636]  Let's talk to Allen in Kentucky.
[01:43:03.736 --> 01:43:04.996]  Allen, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:43:05.016 --> 01:43:05.337]  Go ahead.
[01:43:09.457 --> 01:43:10.498]  I'm sorry, I doubled that.
[01:43:10.578 --> 01:43:11.338]  Mike in New York.
[01:43:11.378 --> 01:43:11.898]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:43:12.825 --> 01:43:15.627]  Oh, how you doing, Alex and Bob?
[01:43:16.668 --> 01:43:17.068]  Excuse me.
[01:43:17.088 --> 01:43:23.113]  Yeah, I've been listening and I heard that caller and, you know, I'm not going to give up.
[01:43:23.273 --> 01:43:24.054]  I'm going to go out.
[01:43:24.134 --> 01:43:25.655]  I'm going to do what I can, too.
[01:43:26.076 --> 01:43:34.663]  And, you know, if it means handing out DVDs to people, which what I've been what I've been doing, then I'm going to do it.
[01:43:34.703 --> 01:43:36.404]  I'm going to do whatever I can to help
[01:43:37.409 --> 01:43:42.132]  Wake some people up, and it has been, you know, I have been having, you know, an effect.
[01:43:42.212 --> 01:43:58.023]  People have been seeing the DVDs, and they see what's going on now, clearly, and a lot of people, they've been making copies, and handing it out to friends and people that they know, and that's the way you do it.
[01:43:58.083 --> 01:44:06.929]  I mean, you have to do something, and, you know, if that's one effective way to do it, then let's do it, right?
[01:44:08.047 --> 01:44:14.416]  In the Homeland Security literature, they are so angry about my films and other films being duplicated and handed out.
[01:44:14.896 --> 01:44:17.360]  Because the lie has to be reapplied every day.
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:23.668]  Once somebody sees the truth, they already knew most of it, it suddenly makes sense, the mind is unlocked.
[01:44:24.489 --> 01:44:33.157]  It only takes one dose of a fall the republic or Obama deception or America freedom to fascism for somebody to really wake up.
[01:44:33.697 --> 01:44:38.722]  It only takes one dose and that's why they're punishing people.
[01:44:38.762 --> 01:44:41.764]  There's an article up at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:44:42.345 --> 01:44:49.091]  America freedom to fascism star Sherry Jackson, IRS agent, is being murdered in prison right now and we've got her letter.
[01:44:49.771 --> 01:44:53.114]  About how they're killing her and not giving her medication.
[01:44:53.414 --> 01:45:02.801]  They want to let other federal agents know that if they come out and admit that internally the IRS knows they work for the private Federal Reserve, they know of their own people.
[01:45:02.821 --> 01:45:06.044]  You know there's a famous photo that my parents brought back to me from East Germany.
[01:45:07.228 --> 01:45:14.451]  After it fell, but it's a famous photo of right after they closed the wall, back in the 50s, of a little toddler.
[01:45:14.511 --> 01:45:23.414]  His parents had gone through, he got caught in the wire, and an East German soldier comes over, untangles him, the parents are begging, and he gives the child to them.
[01:45:23.755 --> 01:45:27.476]  They took that guy and tortured him to death, but he saved a child.
[01:45:27.536 --> 01:45:28.416]  He's a real man.
[01:45:28.777 --> 01:45:31.878]  And that photo is very famous in Germany today.
[01:45:32.638 --> 01:45:36.401]  And so, just like they're torturing her to death, they tortured him to death.
[01:45:36.901 --> 01:45:40.603]  And because they want to punish their Nazi forces.
[01:45:41.084 --> 01:45:46.667]  When one of their forces does the right thing, they want to throw him in the deepest dungeon or kill him.
[01:45:48.068 --> 01:45:48.909]  Everybody needs to call.
[01:45:48.949 --> 01:45:50.170]  We have the phone numbers up there.
[01:45:50.430 --> 01:45:52.951]  And let these criminals know that we know they're murdering her.
[01:45:53.312 --> 01:45:53.932]  Bob Chapman.
[01:45:55.193 --> 01:45:58.275]  I'm running that letter tomorrow in the International Forecaster.
[01:45:59.035 --> 01:46:01.157]  And I received it like you did.
[01:46:01.961 --> 01:46:03.982]  And I think it's tragic.
[01:46:04.282 --> 01:46:13.348]  And there's so many people you never hear about that get thrown into prison for victimless crimes, we'll call them.
[01:46:14.088 --> 01:46:20.852]  Alan Stang, you know, who just died recently, he was thrown in prison because he fought the tax system.
[01:46:21.662 --> 01:46:23.522]  And of course, you know what the outcome was.
[01:46:23.542 --> 01:46:30.444]  The court doesn't listen, and the judges do what they're told to do, and off Alan went for a couple of years in prison.
[01:46:30.944 --> 01:46:33.944]  And so this is what they do when they get you there.
[01:46:34.425 --> 01:46:38.625]  Alan told me that when he was in there, they did everything possible to... Stay there, Bob.
[01:46:38.645 --> 01:46:39.626]  Let's do one more segment.
[01:46:39.646 --> 01:46:40.886]  I want you to finish that story.
[01:46:41.346 --> 01:46:43.286]  These are real heroes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:43.866 --> 01:46:46.207]  This is what we're up against, but we're winning.
[01:46:46.367 --> 01:46:46.927]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:50.839 --> 01:46:57.681]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:46:57.821 --> 01:46:59.062]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:46:59.082 --> 01:46:59.762]  It's very real.
[01:46:59.902 --> 01:47:03.664]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:47:03.804 --> 01:47:08.145]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:47:08.285 --> 01:47:10.546]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:47:10.846 --> 01:47:16.649]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[01:47:16.849 --> 01:47:21.591]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[01:47:21.651 --> 01:47:24.372]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:47:24.472 --> 01:47:27.093]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:47:27.193 --> 01:47:34.357]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:47:38.379 --> 01:47:38.619]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:47:38.639 --> 01:47:40.560]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:47:50.623 --> 01:47:54.506]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible, federal deficit spending?
[01:47:54.746 --> 01:47:58.868]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[01:47:58.988 --> 01:48:00.369]  You get less for your money.
[01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:06.433]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at MIDAS Resources.
[01:48:06.453 --> 01:48:06.493]  800-688-7000.
[01:48:07.674 --> 01:48:08.114]  I think?
[01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:35.381]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:48:35.421 --> 01:48:37.082]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:48:37.102 --> 01:48:38.422]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:49:01.494 --> 01:49:04.157]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:49:04.177 --> 01:49:10.402]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:49:10.562 --> 01:49:15.607]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:49:15.747 --> 01:49:18.910]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:49:18.930 --> 01:49:25.736]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:49:25.856 --> 01:49:27.958]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:49:28.198 --> 01:49:29.519]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:32.062]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:49:32.242 --> 01:49:34.084]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:49:34.364 --> 01:49:39.168]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:49:39.529 --> 01:49:48.877]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:52.856 --> 01:49:53.976]  This is not a drill.
[01:49:54.076 --> 01:49:56.057]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[01:49:56.577 --> 01:49:58.198]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[01:49:58.478 --> 01:50:05.620]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:10.042]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[01:50:10.102 --> 01:50:12.623]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques.
[01:50:12.723 --> 01:50:15.484]  Where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[01:50:15.524 --> 01:50:16.664]  How to create the perfect
[01:50:16.664 --> 01:50:17.104]  I think so.
[01:50:38.353 --> 01:50:40.293]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[01:50:40.414 --> 01:50:41.434]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:50:41.654 --> 01:50:48.155]  Before they come for your guns, hideyourguns.com right now.
[01:51:04.627 --> 01:51:08.332]  Sherry Jackson, IRS agent, went public, exposed the fraud.
[01:51:08.372 --> 01:51:09.974]  They arrested her, threw her in prison.
[01:51:09.994 --> 01:51:15.841]  They have special tax courts that are outside of the regular law, but these judges just do whatever they want.
[01:51:17.062 --> 01:51:21.185]  This is the private taxing system of the offshore banks that are raping and robbing us.
[01:51:21.485 --> 01:51:25.969]  And I have a special message to the police and military and others coming up in the next segment.
[01:51:25.989 --> 01:51:29.631]  But finishing up the story, you were telling about Alan Stang who died this year.
[01:51:30.052 --> 01:51:33.474]  Alan Stang being some of the things they did to him in jail.
[01:51:34.795 --> 01:51:42.721]  Well, they did everything possible, he said, to try him to get the rules so that they could mistreat him.
[01:51:43.559 --> 01:51:48.222]  And fortunately for him, he was very, very careful, and it didn't happen.
[01:51:49.163 --> 01:51:56.147]  But these kinds of, quote, criminals are treated that way because they influence society in a big way.
[01:51:56.848 --> 01:52:05.534]  And anybody who is a tax processor, which Alan was at one time, has a field of influence.
[01:52:06.254 --> 01:52:08.956]  And so that's why they did what they did to him.
[01:52:09.616 --> 01:52:12.158]  And of course, as you know, he wrote a number of books.
[01:52:12.931 --> 01:52:22.799]  And there's one we've been advertising, Pastroika Sunset, which is a very good book about what happened to our men in Southeast Asia.
[01:52:23.559 --> 01:52:26.582]  And we do have a few copies of it left.
[01:52:27.022 --> 01:52:30.304]  But anyway, that's what you can expect from government.
[01:52:30.965 --> 01:52:31.966]  They are in control.
[01:52:32.866 --> 01:52:41.353]  If you do lose and have to go to jail, you keep your mouth shut and just hope that you don't have to go through with
[01:52:42.496 --> 01:52:47.336]  That which this former IRS agent has gone through.
[01:52:49.275 --> 01:52:50.175]  Absolutely, Bob.
[01:52:50.195 --> 01:52:53.176]  Well, in closing, I'm going to come back and take calls and cover some news.
[01:52:53.196 --> 01:52:53.936]  We're going to let you go.
[01:52:53.956 --> 01:52:55.496]  We appreciate your weekly visit with us.
[01:52:55.956 --> 01:52:58.977]  People can go to TheInternationalForecaster.com and get a free issue there.
[01:52:58.997 --> 01:53:03.258]  It comes out twice a week in the e-format, a few times a month in the hard copy.
[01:53:03.378 --> 01:53:07.699]  In closing, I didn't want to get into this whole discussion about loser attitude.
[01:53:07.719 --> 01:53:12.099]  That's happened one time before when a caller called in and said something similar.
[01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:14.900]  But I'm not putting a good face on it.
[01:53:15.819 --> 01:53:19.261]  To say that we're having the biggest victories we've ever had week after week now.
[01:53:19.721 --> 01:53:23.564]  More victories than we would have in 10 years previously we're having in a week now.
[01:53:24.324 --> 01:53:34.391]  And that's only the beginning of this if people get up and stand up because the population is ready to hear the truth worldwide right now and the people are discovering this global government grid.
[01:53:35.211 --> 01:53:45.674]  And I just hope that everyone redoubles their efforts going into the new year to wake up as many people as they can and to take over their towns and cities peacefully through the political process.
[01:53:45.734 --> 01:53:48.815]  It's been the crooks and the liars and the parasites.
[01:53:48.935 --> 01:53:52.276]  They know the power of taking action, so they've gone in and taken over.
[01:53:56.097 --> 01:53:57.278]  Your comments on that statement?
[01:53:57.318 --> 01:54:00.278]  You know, they've taken over because we've allowed them to.
[01:54:00.298 --> 01:54:01.899]  We were too busy doing something else.
[01:54:02.964 --> 01:54:11.052]  And now with high unemployment, an economy that's spiraling downward, there is no recovery going on.
[01:54:11.072 --> 01:54:12.633]  That's just more propaganda.
[01:54:13.394 --> 01:54:19.039]  And unless they increase and have another stimulus plan, we're going to go into depression.
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:22.823]  And before we get there, there's going to be a lot of inflation.
[01:54:25.717 --> 01:54:26.837]  The public's got to wake up.
[01:54:26.877 --> 01:54:30.439]  They've got to say to themselves, well, gee, why did this all happen?
[01:54:30.839 --> 01:54:35.522]  And get outside the box and listen to Alex and people like him who are talking about this.
[01:54:36.002 --> 01:54:44.327]  Well, Bob, I read earlier an El Centro holds position for the highest jobless rate in the country, CNN Money, of 32.2%.
[01:54:44.687 --> 01:54:46.888]  All the real indexes nationally are over 20.
[01:54:47.228 --> 01:54:48.829]  CNBC says 17.5.
[01:54:49.509 --> 01:54:52.371]  But Obama says unemployment is dropping, Bob.
[01:54:53.769 --> 01:54:58.550]  Well yeah, the U3 is what they call that, and it just dropped from 10.2 to 10%.
[01:54:59.651 --> 01:55:07.353]  And you know, I have the breakdown on the jobs here, and payroll at builders declined $27,000 after falling $56,000 the month before.
[01:55:10.451 --> 01:55:17.677]  And the factory payrolls fell $41,000 after decreasing $51,000 the month before.
[01:55:18.017 --> 01:55:19.559]  These are the high paying jobs.
[01:55:20.079 --> 01:55:23.082]  Now let's go over to where the jobs were recreated.
[01:55:23.602 --> 01:55:27.865]  And I'll preface this by saying these are the lowest paying jobs in the economy.
[01:55:28.386 --> 01:55:32.409]  Banks, insurance companies, restaurants, and retailers.
[01:55:34.291 --> 01:55:36.953]  And that's only a microscopic Christmas bump.
[01:55:39.528 --> 01:55:56.834]  Well, it is not a truthful annual take on this thing because, you know, retailers add people because it's Christmas time, as you point out, and then restaurants do more business because people are rushing from here to there because it's a holiday season.
[01:55:57.674 --> 01:56:02.516]  And banks and insurance companies, I don't know how many they put on, but I don't think it was very many.
[01:56:04.102 --> 01:56:04.582]  Amazing.
[01:56:05.062 --> 01:56:10.725]  Bob Chapman, we'll talk to you again coming up live next Friday in the one o'clock hour.
[01:56:10.785 --> 01:56:11.785]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[01:56:11.805 --> 01:56:13.086]  Have a great weekend.
[01:56:13.906 --> 01:56:16.447]  Thank you, Alex, and audience, thank you very much.
[01:56:17.768 --> 01:56:21.390]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:56:23.290 --> 01:56:24.071]  I want to go over
[01:56:25.373 --> 01:56:29.956]  This Sherry Jackson IRS agent being slowly murdered in prison.
[01:56:30.376 --> 01:56:36.620]  I've got a message to the people out there in government that think of us as animals and think all their sins are cute and funny.
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:39.261]  It's not cute and you're going to be judged.
[01:56:40.502 --> 01:56:41.402]  We're on the march.
[01:56:41.903 --> 01:56:43.504]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:56:44.424 --> 01:56:47.126]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:50.882 --> 01:56:56.064]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[01:57:51.149 --> 01:57:54.812]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:57:54.832 --> 01:57:58.174]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:57:58.414 --> 01:58:03.178]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:58:03.198 --> 01:58:09.442]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:58:09.602 --> 01:58:11.844]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:58:12.344 --> 01:58:12.664]  Tim Geithner?
[01:58:12.684 --> 01:58:13.105]  Bernanke?
[01:58:13.185 --> 01:58:13.545]  They're arsonists!
[01:58:13.565 --> 01:58:14.506]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:58:14.526 --> 01:58:16.648]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:58:31.283 --> 01:58:33.125]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:58:33.406 --> 01:58:38.252]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:58:38.572 --> 01:58:47.684]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:50.370 --> 01:58:52.973]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:53.394 --> 01:58:58.361]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:58.721 --> 01:59:00.443]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:00.764 --> 01:59:05.350]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.850]  We're good.
[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:29.741]  How much will you need?
[01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:30.601]  We don't know.
[01:59:30.882 --> 01:59:31.782]  How much do you want?
[01:59:31.982 --> 01:59:32.723]  All you can get.
[01:59:32.923 --> 01:59:33.764]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:34.004 --> 01:59:36.786]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:37.066 --> 01:59:38.828]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:38.848 --> 01:59:39.748]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:53.101 --> 01:59:56.764]  I just realized I've done 2 hours, 3 hours, and 33 minutes.
[01:59:56.784 --> 01:59:59.226]  3 hours and 33 minutes of radio.
[02:00:18.677 --> 02:00:20.198]  I haven't even plugged any of our sponsors.
[02:00:20.218 --> 02:00:20.858]  I'm going to do that.
[02:00:21.618 --> 02:00:24.959]  Then I've got a little message to the police, military, government, bureaucrats.
[02:00:25.599 --> 02:00:27.380]  I understand your mindset, your psychology.
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:30.121]  I'm going to talk directly to you here in just a moment.
[02:00:30.181 --> 02:00:32.102]  First, I want to tell you about some of our sponsors.
[02:00:32.122 --> 02:00:38.424]  You've heard all the medical doctors here on the show talk about colloidal silver, nano silver, how good it is against bacteria and viruses.
[02:00:39.524 --> 02:00:46.614]  And one of the greatest delivery systems is the lungs and they have details about that at silverlungs.com.
[02:00:46.734 --> 02:00:48.997]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:00:49.338 --> 02:00:55.566]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a highly cost-effective colloidal silver generator and lung delivery system that produces pure and endless colloidal silver.
[02:00:56.107 --> 02:00:58.007]  and delivers the solution directly in the bloodstream.
[02:00:58.348 --> 02:01:01.888]  The mucous membranes of the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens.
[02:01:02.189 --> 02:01:06.069]  The Silver Lungs Generator instantly arms these mucous membranes with nano-sized silver.
[02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:14.992]  Go to SilverLungs.com and be sure to check out their complete line of colloidal silver generators and very affordable ready-made ionic silver solutions or check out their banner on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:15.012 --> 02:01:16.652]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[02:01:16.732 --> 02:01:19.793]  Also, the Atmospheric Water Generator, it grabs
[02:01:21.283 --> 02:01:23.564]  Seven and a half gallons a day and average humidity out of the air.
[02:01:23.604 --> 02:01:24.565]  That's their smaller unit.
[02:01:24.585 --> 02:01:27.246]  Looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top.
[02:01:27.626 --> 02:01:28.427]  It's a Ecola Blue.
[02:01:28.467 --> 02:01:30.568]  EcolaBlue.com.
[02:01:31.348 --> 02:01:33.029]  Fabulous line of products.
[02:01:33.069 --> 02:01:35.971]  The atmospheric water generator I use in my home.
[02:01:36.331 --> 02:01:38.232]  EcolaBlue.com or give them a call at 800-691-6043.
[02:01:38.252 --> 02:01:38.432]  That's 800-691-6043.
[02:01:44.096 --> 02:01:51.747]  Yes, there is water in the atmosphere and you can grab it out then it goes through seven stage filter process and is stored in a tank.
[02:01:52.087 --> 02:01:52.968]  Stainless steel on the bottom.
[02:01:53.008 --> 02:01:54.591]  It has hot water and cold water.
[02:01:54.651 --> 02:01:55.612]  It's just a really great unit.
[02:01:55.893 --> 02:01:56.473]  acolablue.com 800-691-6043.
[02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:03.621]  And finally, I want to tell you about Front Sight Firearms Training.
[02:02:03.721 --> 02:02:05.882]  FrontSight.com, like the front of your rifle.
[02:02:05.942 --> 02:02:09.583]  FrontSight.com is the premier private firearms training in the country.
[02:02:09.603 --> 02:02:14.525]  A lot of military and police go there to tune up their training to above law enforcement and military training.
[02:02:14.805 --> 02:02:15.586]  It's the biggest private...
[02:02:16.616 --> 02:02:18.057]  Firearms Training Center in the country.
[02:02:18.077 --> 02:02:20.879]  They have a lot of free information on their site, FrontSight.com.
[02:02:20.899 --> 02:02:22.400]  They're based outside Pahrump, Nevada.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:24.982]  There's no drill instructor or tough guy attitude.
[02:02:25.042 --> 02:02:26.383]  It's family friendly.
[02:02:27.424 --> 02:02:29.445]  And it's just really great to find out about it.
[02:02:29.485 --> 02:02:30.666]  It's FrontSight.com.
[02:02:30.686 --> 02:02:39.572]  You can also get a 30-stake concealed weapons permit, five days of world-class gun training, and receive a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:02:39.893 --> 02:02:42.234]  FrontSight.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:42.254 --> 02:02:43.175]  That's FrontSight.com.
[02:02:45.356 --> 02:02:51.799]  And last but not least, I have an online video bookstore with t-shirts, ball caps.
[02:02:51.839 --> 02:02:53.300]  You want to meet like-minded people?
[02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:55.401]  Wear an InfoWars.com shirt.
[02:02:55.801 --> 02:02:58.362]  Wear a Don't Tread on Me with InfoWars.com shirt.
[02:02:58.402 --> 02:03:03.245]  Wear an Obama Joker shirt out to the pool hall or the church or wherever.
[02:03:03.565 --> 02:03:05.646]  You're going to meet like-minded people, I will assure you.
[02:03:06.106 --> 02:03:08.287]  I can go to a country music concert and people are wearing them.
[02:03:08.307 --> 02:03:13.710]  I went to a Megadeth concert I was invited to by Dave Mustaine this week in Dallas, and I mean, I saw my shirts everywhere.
[02:03:14.130 --> 02:03:15.130]  Most of them were homemade.
[02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:16.391]  Make a homemade one if you want.
[02:03:16.411 --> 02:03:19.151]  The point is that's all available at InfoWars.com.
[02:03:19.171 --> 02:03:25.293]  We have deals right now with free videos and free t-shirts for a limited time until Christmas or until they run out.
[02:03:25.333 --> 02:03:26.373]  Looks like they'll probably run out.

[02:03:45.563 --> 02:03:46.845]  You can also write to us at P.L.
[02:03:46.865 --> 02:03:47.627]  Box 19549, Austin, TX 78760.
[02:03:52.939 --> 02:03:59.963]  You buy a 1995 Fall of the Republic 2-hour, 20-something minute film, 30 minutes of extras, exposing the whole agenda, get a free t-shirt.

[02:04:43.945 --> 02:04:48.871]  Okay, I want to take about a three-minute breather here before I really give this message to the police and military.
[02:04:49.131 --> 02:04:54.597]  Will you guys get that Switzerland newscast about why Switzerland has the lowest crime rate?
[02:04:54.617 --> 02:04:55.958]  Remember that video I gave you this morning?
[02:04:56.983 --> 02:05:05.565]  As soon as you get that queued up, I want to play that because it's a message I want to put out there about why their crime rate is so low and how our founding fathers went off the Swiss model.
[02:05:05.825 --> 02:05:16.307]  That's really where our model came from, where everyone must own a gun by law and you have to do drills where you practice hiding them from the government in case the government is taken over by tyranny.
[02:05:16.567 --> 02:05:24.589]  The government teaches the people if the government ever says give your guns in, that's a tyranny and under federal law they are to resist it with lethal force.
[02:05:24.969 --> 02:05:26.289]  That's what our founders fought too.
[02:05:26.829 --> 02:05:33.431]  I mean, as soon as they say, give us your guns, they are criminal, they are corrupt, they are bad, they are illegitimate, they are evil.
[02:05:34.851 --> 02:05:39.552]  And we have just put up with this for far too long in this society.
[02:05:39.652 --> 02:05:48.174]  So I want to play this clip and then come back with a special message to those in the establishment that are violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution and are not guardians of the Republic.
[02:05:52.409 --> 02:05:56.633]  It's designed to destroy anything standing within its 400 meter trajectory.
[02:05:56.653 --> 02:06:02.397]  And there are over 500,000 of them kept in Swiss homes.
[02:06:03.738 --> 02:06:06.000]  Guns and shooting are a strong Swiss tradition.
[02:06:06.741 --> 02:06:09.323]  Basic military training is mandatory for young men.
[02:06:09.924 --> 02:06:12.906]  And afterwards, they're required to keep their weapon at home.
[02:06:14.627 --> 02:06:18.070]  Mark Heim is the Ticino representative for the lobby group Protel.
[02:06:21.642 --> 02:06:29.966]  Basically, this was my father's military rifle, and of course he got to keep it when he was finished.
[02:06:31.206 --> 02:06:34.268]  I have my grandfather's rifle in the office, hanging on the wall.
[02:06:36.329 --> 02:06:40.730]  This was mine when I did service, which is quite an old one.
[02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:41.711]  It was introduced in 1957.
[02:06:41.751 --> 02:06:42.291]  It was used until 1990.
[02:06:48.072 --> 02:06:49.653]  And this is my son's.
[02:06:50.653 --> 02:06:52.814]  That's the current model.
[02:06:54.095 --> 02:06:55.135]  That's what's being used today.
[02:06:56.536 --> 02:06:59.197]  That's what we'll be using to shoot the Feldschießen today.
[02:07:00.118 --> 02:07:05.920]  The Feldschießen, or Tiro-Federale in Campania as it's known in these parts, is an annual Swiss event.
[02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:08.862]  And it's also the largest shooting festival in the world.
[02:07:09.902 --> 02:07:13.564]  Roughly 200,000 people come out to target practice all across the country.
[02:07:14.611 --> 02:07:16.572]  Ammunition is provided by the government.
[02:07:17.553 --> 02:07:21.555]  Heim goes regularly to this range, and it's often a family affair.
[02:07:22.696 --> 02:07:30.821]  It was organized by the government to have a very high state of readiness for the Swiss military and population.
[02:07:31.241 --> 02:07:38.566]  The target has always been that within 24 to 48 hours, Switzerland could mobilize a pretty large army.
[02:07:38.626 --> 02:07:40.167]  I mean, even by European standards,
[02:07:46.823 --> 02:07:50.589]  But it wasn't the militia that sparked Haim's interest in guns as a young man.
[02:07:50.609 --> 02:07:54.114]  It was an unassuming trip to a Holocaust museum.
[02:07:54.134 --> 02:08:00.084]  I was going through all the exhibits and the soap and the lampshades made of people's skin.
[02:08:01.346 --> 02:08:14.272]  And while I was looking, I heard a funny noise, and there was an old woman, maybe two meters from me, and she was trying not to cry.
[02:08:15.292 --> 02:08:17.453]  She was sort of sobbing very quietly.
[02:08:17.473 --> 02:08:18.234]  She was holding it back.
[02:08:18.294 --> 02:08:20.355]  If she had been a few meters further away, I wouldn't have heard her.
[02:08:21.255 --> 02:08:23.376]  And she obviously had gone through that.
[02:08:24.076 --> 02:08:26.898]  That's when the whole impact of it hit me.
[02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:31.389]  And I promised myself I would never be in her situation.
[02:08:32.908 --> 02:08:43.674]  I would want to be free, never in a situation where somebody could, you know, march us off to ovens or prisons or just take away our freedom.
[02:08:44.474 --> 02:08:48.436]  The key to freedom is the ability to be able to defend yourself.
[02:08:49.216 --> 02:08:54.719]  And if you don't have the tools to do that, then you are at the mercy of whoever wants to put you away.
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:58.361]  And the tools for that are guns.
[02:09:01.636 --> 02:09:02.416]  Absolutely.
[02:09:02.717 --> 02:09:06.798]  Well, well said there in that short video.
[02:09:06.918 --> 02:09:13.221]  You see, we got the secret Homeland Security and MIAC documents earlier in the year.
[02:09:13.421 --> 02:09:14.001]  We broke it.
[02:09:14.702 --> 02:09:20.604]  People couldn't believe it when it said Ron Paul supporters were terrorists, gun owners were terrorists, returning veterans were the main threat.
[02:09:20.965 --> 02:09:24.506]  That Homeland Security was really built to rob the American people.
[02:09:24.866 --> 02:09:28.248]  It's an internal police force like the Soviets or the Nazis had.
[02:09:29.048 --> 02:09:33.111]  To make you thumb scan, face scan, national ID card to buy and sell.
[02:09:33.131 --> 02:09:37.875]  They're now saying if you're on the no-fly list that they just put you on with no evidence, you won't be able to buy a gun.
[02:09:38.495 --> 02:09:40.056]  This is the hardcore tyranny.
[02:09:41.477 --> 02:09:51.805]  And I know the police and military are brainwashed how the public doesn't like them and they're the only line of defense against anarchy and oh they're out there stopping lawlessness.
[02:09:52.466 --> 02:09:57.990]  And to a great extent that's true because they're doing some things that are good and then a lot of things that are bad as well.
[02:09:59.224 --> 02:10:03.648]  And you have a federal government that has been taken over by private offshore banks.
[02:10:04.148 --> 02:10:09.092]  And it's illegitimate and criminal and violates the Bill of Rights and Constitution from one end to the other.
[02:10:10.433 --> 02:10:16.198]  And that's a very simple equation that I know you can understand.
[02:10:17.344 --> 02:10:18.365]  Servants of the system.
[02:10:19.285 --> 02:10:20.246]  I have seen police.
[02:10:20.446 --> 02:10:21.346]  I have seen judges.
[02:10:21.447 --> 02:10:22.527]  I have seen bureaucrats.
[02:10:23.088 --> 02:10:24.648]  Relish setting people up.
[02:10:25.249 --> 02:10:26.650]  Relish framing people.
[02:10:27.110 --> 02:10:30.112]  Relish beating somebody up and then saying that they assaulted you.
[02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:38.831]  I have seen how we've been trained that evil and corruption and deception is manly and cool.
[02:10:39.371 --> 02:10:43.893]  And Jack Bauer on 24 tortures innocent people, but he's a good guy.
[02:10:44.653 --> 02:10:49.955]  And all these other programs brainwashing us, turning the American people into evil, corrupt creatures.
[02:10:52.116 --> 02:10:54.257]  Our country has been illegitimately hijacked.
[02:10:55.373 --> 02:11:02.396]  It's bigger than the political parties, it's a financial dictatorship, and the government is a crooked, corrupt fraud.
[02:11:02.676 --> 02:11:03.136]  Period.
[02:11:03.877 --> 02:11:12.741]  Now, the American people don't want physical war with the criminal system, but it's going to want physical war, and it's engaged in physical war against us every day.
[02:11:15.222 --> 02:11:24.026]  And people everywhere are waking up to this injustice, and I just want the police and military and bureaucrats and everyone else to realize
[02:11:25.285 --> 02:11:29.702]  The American people and the people of the world who are being tyrannized are human beings.
[02:11:30.183 --> 02:11:31.107]  We have value.
[02:11:32.401 --> 02:11:43.549]  When you falsely charge us, or falsely arrest us, or falsely persecute us, or when these grand juries become kept creatures of the prosecutor, and engage in corruption against good people.
[02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:47.592]  Throw the book at innocent patriots, but release violent offenders.
[02:11:48.172 --> 02:11:56.879]  You are committing massive frauds and massive crimes, and it doesn't matter if your corrupt system gives you a green light to do it and tells you it's okay.
[02:11:57.419 --> 02:12:01.242]  You know in your gut it's wrong, and it's not cute, and it's not funny.
[02:12:03.553 --> 02:12:08.077]  Now, as a society, we are at a crossroads.
[02:12:10.179 --> 02:12:21.370]  And I just ask servants of the establishment, even if you've engaged in corruption and lied to yourself about it and rationalized why you're doing it, it's not too late for you to turn back.
[02:12:22.836 --> 02:12:31.185]  And just at least start being a better person and start treating people like human beings and stop engaging in corruption and violations of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:12:31.845 --> 02:12:34.148]  Because the bankers have decided to bring us into depression.
[02:12:34.588 --> 02:12:36.150]  They've decided to set up a police state.
[02:12:36.430 --> 02:12:38.572]  They've decided to try to forcibly inoculate people.
[02:12:39.053 --> 02:12:43.037]  They've decided to corner people and force the population to fight back.
[02:12:43.357 --> 02:12:45.059]  And more and more of that is going to happen.
[02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:59.501]  And in the end, the police and military that try to engage the American people in tyranny are going to be known as enemies of the Republic and are going to be known in history as scum and are going to be brought to justice.
[02:12:59.541 --> 02:13:02.283]  So you need to listen to me very careful right now.
[02:13:02.784 --> 02:13:11.472]  It is time for you to unharden your hearts and to really reflect this weekend on who you are and what you are and who you want to be in this short life.
[02:13:13.584 --> 02:13:16.148]  It is now time for you to do the right thing.
[02:13:18.651 --> 02:13:27.163]  I hope you'll do the right thing, but at least reflect on what our country and what our world has turned into and ask yourself,
[02:13:29.244 --> 02:13:30.805]  Do you want to change course in your life?
[02:13:30.845 --> 02:13:42.612]  Because if you don't know this government's corrupt, if you don't know our society's imploding, if you don't know that the government's illegitimate, and if you don't understand it's growing like a cancer, you are blind.
[02:13:42.852 --> 02:13:43.973]  Something is wrong with you.
[02:13:44.073 --> 02:13:46.234]  Something is fundamentally screwed up with you.
[02:13:48.295 --> 02:13:48.976]  There, I've said it.
[02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:57.641]  We have an article up on Infowars.com, American Freedom to Fascism star Sherry Jackson is being murdered.
[02:13:58.001 --> 02:14:05.023]  I would have the headline, Valiant Inside IRS Whistleblower Being Politically Persecuted and Tortured.
[02:14:05.043 --> 02:14:06.823]  I don't know about being a star.
[02:14:07.283 --> 02:14:10.744]  I don't ever think of this work we do as being stars, but my heart breaks.
[02:14:11.144 --> 02:14:16.965]  How do those continue to sit by as our fellow human beings are put behind bars and treated as subhuman?
[02:14:17.525 --> 02:14:19.185]  Have we lost touch with our humanity?
[02:14:19.245 --> 02:14:19.506]  Yes.
[02:14:19.946 --> 02:14:21.566]  And when we lose touch with our humanity,
[02:14:23.786 --> 02:14:26.647]  Then everybody starts getting abused, because people then accept it.
[02:14:27.667 --> 02:14:31.708]  I see hundreds of movies now, every movie where they show tasering and being tortured is fine.
[02:14:31.928 --> 02:14:33.808]  They're selling us that torture's cute and funny.
[02:14:35.409 --> 02:14:40.050]  I pray for those behind bars, as our country holds more prisoners than any other country on the planet.
[02:14:40.410 --> 02:14:42.250]  Even Obama's favorite, Red China.
[02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:45.431]  We see how they treat brown people in cages overseas.
[02:14:46.111 --> 02:14:47.632]  They are profiled as potential terrorists.
[02:14:48.452 --> 02:14:50.392]  You think they're going to treat us any better?
[02:14:50.752 --> 02:14:53.073]  Torture is torture, and it's wrong, no matter
[02:14:54.158 --> 02:14:54.698]  When used.
[02:14:55.259 --> 02:14:57.299]  In this regard, I choose to walk with Christ.
[02:14:57.339 --> 02:14:58.220]  And it goes on from there.
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:14:59.680]  That's the person that wrote this article.
[02:14:59.741 --> 02:15:00.481]  Don't tread on me.
[02:15:01.661 --> 02:15:09.345]  Now, they then give out the call and fax numbers demanding immediate medication for Sherry Jackson.
[02:15:09.685 --> 02:15:11.526]  And here is Sherry Jackson's letter.
[02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:16.683]  That we posted up at Infowars.com.
[02:15:17.423 --> 02:15:18.484]  Hi friends and family.
[02:15:19.025 --> 02:15:20.286]  Please pray for my wife.
[02:15:20.306 --> 02:15:22.447]  This is from her husband, Sherry Peele Jackson.
[02:15:22.487 --> 02:15:25.790]  She's still having challenges while she's incarcerated.
[02:15:25.870 --> 02:15:28.032]  Thank you in advance for your prayers and encouragement.
[02:15:28.312 --> 02:15:32.075]  Here's a letter from Sherry to our congressman concerning her current situation.
[02:15:32.616 --> 02:15:35.078]  I am Sherry Peele Jackson, your former CPA.
[02:15:35.759 --> 02:15:38.861]  I am writing you because I am concerned that my health and my life.
[02:15:39.282 --> 02:15:41.984]  Prior to becoming a political prisoner, I was the pitcher of health.
[02:15:43.058 --> 02:15:47.522]  In late June 2009, I started experiencing a rapid heartbeat on a regular basis.
[02:15:47.582 --> 02:15:55.268]  That's because it's all GMO, all soy, which is filled with estrogen, all MSG.
[02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:57.851]  It's chemical weapons, what they feed people in prison.
[02:15:58.931 --> 02:16:01.892]  Since this has happened infrequently in the past, I did not think much of it.
[02:16:01.932 --> 02:16:05.594]  However, in mid-July, it started happening on a regular basis, and I became concerned.
[02:16:06.074 --> 02:16:13.477]  I went to the medical staff twice in mid-July, only to be given one-minute EKG tests and powerful meds without proper diagnosis.
[02:16:13.977 --> 02:16:16.618]  I did not take the meds because I had not seen a specialist.
[02:16:17.098 --> 02:16:19.039]  One week later, on July 21st, I felt the
[02:16:22.608 --> 02:16:25.892]  I left the dorm in flip-flops to go tell the officers I was having a heart attack.
[02:16:26.392 --> 02:16:32.219]  The officers on duty called the ambulance, and the ambulance checked my heart for their Profile EKG system machine.
[02:16:32.679 --> 02:16:34.421]  It was beating at 150 beats per minute.
[02:16:34.741 --> 02:16:38.165]  They took me to a hospital where I remained until Friday.
[02:16:38.586 --> 02:16:43.651]  During my hospital stay, it was determined that my heart was healthy, but my thyroid was producing too much hormones.
[02:16:43.691 --> 02:16:43.811]  See?
[02:16:44.412 --> 02:16:49.115]  Everybody's having their thyroids removed right now from all the chemicals in the food, thus speeding up my heart.
[02:16:49.616 --> 02:16:52.698]  This is called hyperthyroidism or Graves' disease.
[02:16:52.758 --> 02:16:56.380]  I was given two medications by the hospital and then it goes on.
[02:16:57.161 --> 02:17:03.906]  The hospital doctor told me four weeks later the prison medical unit was to do blood tests to determine how the thyroid medication was affecting my body.
[02:17:04.286 --> 02:17:09.970]  The blood test was taken in late August and I was told I would be placed on the appropriate schedule and it goes on from there.
[02:17:12.967 --> 02:17:17.070]  And then it just goes into how they're now denying her care, even though they admit she has this problem.
[02:17:21.092 --> 02:17:22.032]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:17:22.112 --> 02:17:22.833]  It's a long letter.
[02:17:22.873 --> 02:17:23.753]  It's up on the site.
[02:17:24.594 --> 02:17:26.055]  But it's the food they feed them.
[02:17:26.075 --> 02:17:27.716]  We've done a whole show on this in the past.
[02:17:28.016 --> 02:17:31.098]  And they do all sorts of medical experiments on people in the prisons as well.
[02:17:31.118 --> 02:17:33.119]  I'm going to come back and hit the key parts of this.
[02:17:36.363 --> 02:17:39.786]  Let's finish up with what's happening to this political prisoner right now.
[02:17:40.227 --> 02:17:43.910]  They tried to set up Joe Bannister, the former Treasury agent, but he beat him in court.
[02:17:44.451 --> 02:17:47.434]  She didn't because the judge ordered the jury to convict her, which is criminal.
[02:17:50.379 --> 02:17:53.401]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:17:53.741 --> 02:17:57.363]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:17:57.643 --> 02:18:01.105]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:18:01.385 --> 02:18:08.669]  At less than two cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride and
[02:18:08.729 --> 02:18:10.369]  Well, you know, we've got a lot of contaminants from municipal water.
[02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:18.271]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems from the smallest to the largest systems.
[02:18:18.671 --> 02:18:22.472]  Big Berkey water filters .com has what you need with your system purchase.
[02:18:22.692 --> 02:18:26.553]  You'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter or to sport Berkey bottles.
[02:18:26.733 --> 02:18:27.573]  Absolutely free.
[02:18:27.833 --> 02:18:29.954]  Big Berkey water filters .com would like to
[02:18:34.515 --> 02:18:36.436]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:18:36.456 --> 02:18:38.637]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:18:38.777 --> 02:18:39.918]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:19:00.945 --> 02:19:03.606]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:19:03.626 --> 02:19:09.807]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:19:10.007 --> 02:19:15.048]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:19:15.548 --> 02:19:18.349]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:19:18.369 --> 02:19:25.170]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:19:25.310 --> 02:19:27.411]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:19:27.651 --> 02:19:28.972]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:19:29.232 --> 02:19:31.514]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:19:31.694 --> 02:19:33.535]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:19:33.555 --> 02:19:38.658]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:19:50.046 --> 02:19:50.727]  Hello, friends.
[02:19:50.787 --> 02:19:53.789]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[02:19:53.909 --> 02:20:03.757]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.

[02:20:13.805 --> 02:20:15.947]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[02:20:16.347 --> 02:20:21.508]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin pure soap products.

[02:20:45.592 --> 02:20:46.413]  You're gonna love him.
[02:20:46.533 --> 02:20:52.878]  You will never use anything else again.
[02:20:54.319 --> 02:20:59.684]  So the letter goes on, admitting that she has this thyroid problem.
[02:20:59.704 --> 02:21:01.425]  They just take her off the medication.
[02:21:01.465 --> 02:21:03.047]  Her lips have swollen up and are black.
[02:21:03.187 --> 02:21:04.108]  Blood's coming out.
[02:21:05.885 --> 02:21:07.126]  She's writing to her congressman.
[02:21:07.166 --> 02:21:08.707]  She says, I'm 46 years old.
[02:21:08.767 --> 02:21:09.528]  I know my body.
[02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:17.254]  I finally convinced them that I was not playing and was not stupid, so they treated me with a packet for stool sample test.
[02:21:18.151 --> 02:21:25.218]  When it came back, they admitted that even months before I'd had the thyroid problem, the blood test showed the problem with the thyroid was happening back then.
[02:21:25.818 --> 02:21:30.523]  He said I would be put on a schedule for new blood work later that week because the results were too old.
[02:21:31.023 --> 02:21:36.248]  He had a short conversation with Dr. D. Lyon in Spanish and then said the thyroid count was off.
[02:21:36.969 --> 02:21:38.130]  That was November 3rd.
[02:21:38.190 --> 02:21:44.252]  I was administered the stool test and then returned to Nurse Charlie on Friday, November 26th.
[02:21:44.872 --> 02:21:46.653]  Today is November 26th, Thanksgiving.
[02:21:47.113 --> 02:21:49.174]  I have not received the results of my stool test.
[02:21:49.474 --> 02:21:50.875]  I have not been given any new blood tests.
[02:21:50.915 --> 02:21:52.555]  My neck is swelling up like a fishbowl.
[02:21:52.895 --> 02:21:53.976]  I'm having trouble talking.
[02:21:54.396 --> 02:21:56.337]  I've been feeling very ill for the last weeks.
[02:21:56.757 --> 02:21:58.658]  Congressman, I don't want them to kill me in here.
[02:21:59.438 --> 02:22:02.600]  As you know well, I am being punished for exposing government fraud.
[02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:05.201]  However, millions of people don't file tax returns.
[02:22:05.281 --> 02:22:11.844]  I was just used as an example by the DOJ for the new program called the Tax Defiers Initiative.
[02:22:12.664 --> 02:22:14.505]  I have a wonderful husband and two beautiful children.
[02:22:14.745 --> 02:22:20.328]  I've already spent 21 months in prison for non-crime, and I refuse to come out dead or marred for life.
[02:22:20.808 --> 02:22:22.509]  I have not caused these people any problems.
[02:22:23.109 --> 02:22:27.071]  This is no threat, but just for your information, I have
[02:22:27.881 --> 02:22:29.922]  Written the warden today.
[02:22:31.043 --> 02:22:35.325]  Things can't go on this way as I language in here for someone's political gain.
[02:22:35.645 --> 02:22:39.527]  God doesn't like ugly and he is the ultimate judge and vindicator.
[02:22:40.967 --> 02:22:41.427]  That's right.
[02:22:42.068 --> 02:22:48.452]  These wardens, these police, these jail guards that are involved in evil, they all have the most hellish lives statistically.
[02:22:49.233 --> 02:22:53.195]  Cancer, alcohol, drug, their families, their kids dying in car wrecks.
[02:22:53.556 --> 02:22:54.196]  Don't worry.
[02:22:54.896 --> 02:22:59.560]  Anyone that abuses good people doesn't have to wait until they die to be judged.
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:00.680]  You get judged now.
[02:23:01.561 --> 02:23:04.463]  Anything bad you do in life comes back on you sevenfold.
[02:23:04.883 --> 02:23:06.564]  The good book says that and it's true.
[02:23:08.065 --> 02:23:09.626]  That's why I want to tell wicked people.
[02:23:10.569 --> 02:23:18.556]  I've been in jail several times, arrested at protest, and every time I've had police slam my head in walls and laugh at me and push me around.
[02:23:18.696 --> 02:23:19.636]  I've seen scum.
[02:23:20.137 --> 02:23:21.017]  I've seen criminals.
[02:23:21.418 --> 02:23:22.939]  I know evil people when I see them.
[02:23:23.439 --> 02:23:28.764]  And the police and the jail guards, their ranks are filled with sadists and sickos and filth.
[02:23:29.687 --> 02:23:35.932]  Who would slam my head in a wall or punch me in the back trying to get me to fight back so they could beat the living daylights out of me.
[02:23:36.292 --> 02:23:40.435]  These are un-American, Nazi blood-sucking, murdering trash.
[02:23:40.896 --> 02:23:44.719]  And they release the hardcore criminals to come out and menace the public.
[02:23:45.499 --> 02:23:49.623]  And the media and the culture is all about worshipping them and worshipping their corruption.
[02:23:50.003 --> 02:23:51.224]  But the people know the truth.
[02:23:51.284 --> 02:23:52.545]  Now, there are a lot of good police.
[02:23:53.446 --> 02:23:55.467]  And I'm sure there must be some good jail guards.
[02:23:55.547 --> 02:23:56.188]  I haven't met them.
[02:23:57.649 --> 02:24:00.010]  And what you're doing is evil.
[02:24:00.250 --> 02:24:01.610]  And what you're doing is wrong.
[02:24:01.751 --> 02:24:04.832]  And just like Hitler's goons, you're going to be brought to justice.
[02:24:04.872 --> 02:24:09.013]  So, if you're on the wrong side of history, you better get back on the right side of history.
[02:24:11.514 --> 02:24:12.834]  She's in the F.C.I.
[02:24:13.135 --> 02:24:16.296]  Coleman Medium Federal Correctional Institution.
[02:24:16.756 --> 02:24:17.056]  P.O.
[02:24:17.076 --> 02:24:17.336]  Box 1032.
[02:24:17.496 --> 02:24:21.317]  Now these crooks don't care that you know that they're killing her.
[02:24:23.198 --> 02:24:25.299]  But they are afraid of the political repercussions.
[02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:32.354]  Okay, so they're enjoying what they're doing, but they are concerned about people learning about what's happening.
[02:24:33.375 --> 02:24:37.737]  See, for a psychopath, it's the pain they induce on people is their daily pleasure.
[02:24:37.757 --> 02:24:38.738]  You like a cup of coffee?
[02:24:39.438 --> 02:24:40.198]  Or going fishing?
[02:24:40.218 --> 02:24:41.199]  They like torturing people.
[02:24:41.479 --> 02:24:42.600]  It's a petty power thing.
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:43.260]  They get off on it.
[02:24:44.681 --> 02:24:45.521]  Coleman, Florida, 33521.
[02:24:48.117 --> 02:24:51.339]  And the website information is up on InfoWars.com.

[02:24:54.681 --> 02:24:55.942]  Everybody call these criminals.
[02:24:57.403 --> 02:24:59.424]  Let them know we're fully aware of their criminal activity.
[02:25:00.305 --> 02:25:08.550]  And let them know if they're wondering why their lives are so cursed, why they're so unhappy, it's because most of your prisoners are innocent people and you're torturing them to death.
[02:25:08.651 --> 02:25:09.171]  And you know why.
[02:25:10.216 --> 02:25:11.457]  You wonder why your life's so bad?
[02:25:11.477 --> 02:25:12.178]  It's because you're evil!
[02:25:12.198 --> 02:25:12.918]  Okay?
[02:25:13.018 --> 02:25:13.799]  That's why you're not happy.
[02:25:14.319 --> 02:25:15.440]  More evil isn't going to make it better.
[02:25:15.781 --> 02:25:17.402]  Back Sunday, live, 4 to 6 p.m.
