[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.121]  I mean, America's going to hell in a handbasket here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:15.324]  You're not even supposed to be able to put up a sign or wear a t-shirt and they're saying that I need to be arrested for racism and a hate crime.
[00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:19.245]  And now they're saying if you use the word socialist, it's a hate crime.
[00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:24.549]  That's what the hate crime bill that passed the House and is now in the Senate says.
[00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.132]  That if you hurt someone's feelings, you're arrested and put in prison.
[00:00:27.813 --> 00:00:29.035]  Not even if a crime's committed.
[00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.276]  Hurting feelings.
[00:00:30.737 --> 00:00:31.377]  Well, you know what?
[00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:32.439]  We're selling the t-shirt.
[00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:35.504]  That says socialism on it.
[00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:37.285]  We sell one that says fascism on it.
[00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.668]  We sell one that says Infowars.com on it.
[00:00:40.048 --> 00:00:41.049]  One that says New World Order.
[00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:49.198]  The mainstream media is giving us credit saying that we started the entire Obama Joker thing.
[00:00:49.598 --> 00:00:53.002]  Well, number one, I'd be proud if I'd started this a month ago in LA.
[00:00:53.382 --> 00:00:53.682]  I didn't.
[00:00:54.503 --> 00:00:57.086]  Two weeks ago when they said, censor whoever's doing this.
[00:00:57.546 --> 00:00:59.087]  They need to be arrested.
[00:00:59.168 --> 00:00:59.948]  They're criminals.
[00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:00.769]  They're racist.
[00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.432]  I said, no, it's saying he's a criminal.
[00:01:03.752 --> 00:01:04.933]  And people did this to Bush.
[00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:11.980]  And so, people need to post more of these in legal and lawful places.
[00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:24.796]  In the Commons area, under common law, you see the posters all over downtown, or you see 20 posters on a pole, you can put a poster up, and if they come selectively in force against you, that's a big civil rights violation.
[00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:26.617]  It's just flat wrong, man!
[00:01:27.077 --> 00:01:28.158]  It's hypocrisy!
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.721]  And people are seeing through this.
[00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:35.705]  90 plus percent of the posts in all these newspaper articles, all these TV stories, go read them for yourself.
[00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:37.526]  We have them linked on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:45.572]  I mean, there's probably 10, 15, 20 posts saying how ridiculous the hypocrisy is and way to go putting the posters up.
[00:01:45.912 --> 00:01:57.581]  Now, I am seeing people post videos on YouTube where since the cops started threatening people and saying this is wrong, they're actually going to post offices and going to police stations and putting them on them.
[00:01:57.901 --> 00:01:58.482]  Don't do that.
[00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:00.373]  Have your First Amendment.
[00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:01.954]  Put it where other people put posters.
[00:02:03.354 --> 00:02:04.655]  Put it in the downtown areas.
[00:02:04.695 --> 00:02:05.916]  Put it on bulletin boards.
[00:02:05.976 --> 00:02:06.776]  Give them to people.
[00:02:10.058 --> 00:02:14.221]  But I... I mean, that's what our founding fathers actually did go and put stuff on.
[00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:15.341]  Redcoat police stations.
[00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:16.742]  They actually did do stuff like that.
[00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:22.045]  They do stuff like burn images of the redcoats, you know, out front the police station.
[00:02:22.785 --> 00:02:23.506]  And then, um...
[00:02:26.664 --> 00:02:30.329]  If the Redcoats beat somebody up, they'd stop the Redcoats on the road and beat them up.
[00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.011]  I'm not calling for any of that.
[00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:32.632]  That's evil.
[00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:34.354]  That's Founding Father type stuff.
[00:02:34.374 --> 00:02:40.743]  And I think it's somewhat sarcastic, but seriously, I don't want that to happen because the establishment wants violence to break out.
[00:02:41.985 --> 00:02:44.167]  Now, enough said about that.
[00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:46.752]  We've now put up a t-shirt.
[00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:47.592]  These are in.
[00:02:48.212 --> 00:02:48.872]  These are selling.
[00:02:48.912 --> 00:02:49.793]  We have these in stock.
[00:02:50.113 --> 00:02:52.213]  We're now manufacturing today.
[00:02:52.694 --> 00:02:53.794]  We have a three-day turnaround.
[00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.175]  So today, Saturday, and then Monday.
[00:02:56.455 --> 00:02:58.196]  By Tuesday, we'll have these t-shirts.
[00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:04.738]  We've made a Bush fascist to show that it is nonpartisan and that
[00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:08.077]  That we're equal opportunity offenders.
[00:03:08.117 --> 00:03:12.721]  But, under the First Amendment, if we just want to criticize Obama, that's our right as well.
[00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:19.426]  And so, here is the poster, and everybody can get this t-shirt, it says InfoWars.com on the back.
[00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:23.449]  But all the Obama ones are available at InfoWars.com, and get them while you can.
[00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.192]  Lord knows they may just go ahead and make all this illegal, and I'm not joking about that.
[00:03:27.212 --> 00:03:30.995]  So I want to get Stewart Rhodes' take on that coming up, but not yet.
[00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:33.116]  We're going to open the phones up, too, at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:37.563 --> 00:03:41.607]  I know some stations just joined us in the second hour, that's why I'm recapping some top stories.
[00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:49.694]  The Progressive newspaper is reporting, magazine is reporting, the Pentagon wants the authority to boost 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[00:03:50.194 --> 00:03:55.499]  This is directly from the Congressional record, in violation of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:04.146]  They've already announced 20,000 troops under Brigade Homeland, suddenly from California to Tennessee to upstate New York, from Schenectady, New York,
[00:04:05.187 --> 00:04:33.915]  uh... to uh... arcadia iowa army regular army national guard marines state guards are running checkpoints searching people actually arresting people running d w i checkpoints things that are seen as popular to acclimate the public and they admit this is for domestic operations in the homeland security documents we broke that we got from people inside on my security in the department defense documents we broke they were later confirmed mainstream news
[00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:40.180]  In the secret clergy response teams and InfraGard documents we broke that were years later confirmed to be real.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.401]  I know they're real, they come directly from sources.
[00:04:45.804 --> 00:04:53.149]  Massachusetts deputizes Dennis Paramedics Pharmacist to administer flu vaccine, Boston Globe, for forced inoculations.
[00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:02.837]  We have another one here where the congressman is in the news saying that they are preparing for
[00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:10.387]  Total martial law and using this as the cover to do that.
[00:05:10.427 --> 00:05:13.548]  I'm looking for it here in my stack.
[00:05:13.588 --> 00:05:14.408]  I'll find it in a moment.
[00:05:14.908 --> 00:05:16.529]  There's just too many of these to keep track of.
[00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:25.632]  German News is reporting there is live cancer viruses in the main vaccine that's being distributed.
[00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:32.974]  So that's why we've got Oath Keepers on and Stuart Rhodes, the founder of it, with us today.
[00:05:32.994 --> 00:05:34.535]  We're going to go to him.
[00:05:36.195 --> 00:05:39.677]  Because Mr. Rhodes started Oath Keepers.
[00:05:39.717 --> 00:05:44.519]  He was a high-level aide in Ron Paul's Congressional office in his presidential campaign.
[00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:46.240]  He's an ex-Army.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.522]  Stuart Rhodes is the founder and director of Oath Keepers.
[00:05:50.603 --> 00:05:59.526]  Military veterans and peace officers who will honor their oaths to defend the Constitution, will not just follow orders, will stand up for liberty and will save the Republic, so help us God.
[00:05:59.606 --> 00:06:10.010]  Our motto is, not on our watch, it's a non-partisan association of currently serving military reserves, National Guard, peace officers, veterans who swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:18.613]  And he is a Yale Law School graduate and was an Army officer in... Well, I mean, give us your exact bio, Stuart.
[00:06:19.437 --> 00:06:20.338]  Oh, I was a paratrooper.
[00:06:20.378 --> 00:06:21.218]  I was an elected man.
[00:06:21.338 --> 00:06:21.999]  I worked for a living.
[00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:25.360]  But I was a paratrooper until I was disabled in a parachuting accident.
[00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:40.779]  Mixing us in with white supremacists, UFO cults, you name it.
[00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:45.763]  And specifically, they attack us together here in this piece.
[00:06:46.283 --> 00:06:47.504]  Go ahead.
[00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:49.246]  They do, you bet.
[00:06:49.406 --> 00:07:00.955]  They quote our interview, in fact, where they say that Roach told Conspiracy Miner's radio host Alex Jones, imagine if we focused on the police and military who came over for the New World Order.
[00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:02.817]  And I want to thank them for pulling that quote out.
[00:07:02.857 --> 00:07:03.717]  I'd forgotten about that.
[00:07:03.737 --> 00:07:04.718]  I think it's a pretty good quote.
[00:07:06.383 --> 00:07:09.586]  But no, they're doing the same thing they've done throughout the last few decades.
[00:07:09.766 --> 00:07:18.293]  Anybody who gets to be a threat to the orthodox, their orthodox plan, they will attack and try to smear and lump in with racists.
[00:07:18.814 --> 00:07:22.296]  Or they tell you that you're racist because a black president's in office, you must be racist.
[00:07:22.337 --> 00:07:34.387]  You oppose anything he does, or you're completely insane, and therefore the government should monitor you, should investigate you, should have a secret file on you, and then should go arrest you if it can.
[00:07:36.488 --> 00:07:40.389]  Did you see the comments in the article where they say that we need to be killed?
[00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:41.489]  Have you seen that yet?
[00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.150]  No, I haven't seen that yet.
[00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.110]  No, I have not.
[00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:48.872]  I saw it on the Alan Combs Show, which was a really horrible interview.
[00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:55.294]  All he wanted to do was accuse me of being sensationalistic and paranoid.
[00:07:55.894 --> 00:07:59.095]  But he had comments on his own side that were pretty atrocious too.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:10.077]  Well, I mean, the Louisville newspapers, the AP and others are reporting, I'm going to dig them out and cover them coming up, as soon as I find them, they are
[00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:18.273]  Congressman Brown is saying this is being used for martial law, that Congress has been threatened with martial law.
[00:08:18.674 --> 00:08:27.222]  We have now the Pentagon publicly saying they want to deploy 400,000 regular army on the streets of America.
[00:08:27.242 --> 00:08:30.225]  I mean, this is an occupation rivaling Baghdad.
[00:08:31.346 --> 00:08:32.868]  This is really happening.
[00:08:34.127 --> 00:08:40.530]  Yeah, well, tipping over to the blue idea, that has always been the one thing that people throw back at us about our current order.
[00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:41.670]  They say, what about a pandemic?
[00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:48.693]  And so I can't think of a stronger pretext short of a news going off in American City for trying to declare martial law.
[00:08:48.873 --> 00:08:51.494]  But as you know, martial law has no constitutional basis whatsoever.
[00:08:51.974 --> 00:08:55.495]  So I get killed sick and tired of hearing all these politicians throwing around the word martial law.
[00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.115]  They have no idea what they're talking about.
[00:08:57.275 --> 00:08:59.136]  Martial law is the absolute absence of the law.
[00:08:59.616 --> 00:09:01.397]  It's the will of the commander on the battlefield.
[00:09:01.797 --> 00:09:09.039]  And nowhere in our Constitution is there a kind of escape clause that says, when the weather's bad, you can suspend the Second Amendment like they did in Katrina.
[00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:12.900]  Or if there's a flu outbreak, you can suspend the Constitution, and so does martial law.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.700]  It doesn't exist.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.781]  And so when you look at Article 4, Section 4, that's your answer right there.
[00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.331]  What's it say right there?
[00:09:19.631 --> 00:09:38.066]  It says that the national government shall secure to the state a Republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion and on application of the legislature or of the executive when the legislature cannot be convened against domestic violence.
[00:09:38.646 --> 00:09:45.552]  So what it's saying there is that you have to have the permission of the legislature of the state or only if the legislature cannot be convened, the governor of the state.
[00:09:46.232 --> 00:09:46.713]  And only then
[00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:49.462]  Can the federal government come into a state?
[00:09:50.082 --> 00:09:57.485]  And so that's my first stop when it comes to the constitutionality of any of these plans that NORTHCOM, FEMA, DHS have.
[00:09:57.545 --> 00:10:00.346]  They're acting as though the states don't exist anymore.
[00:10:00.807 --> 00:10:11.231]  Well, the issue, too, is everything should be set up around the state responding because the locals can always spend the money the best and they can also respond the best.
[00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:12.731]  That's been the way we've always operated.
[00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:15.973]  I mean, Congress can't even read its own bills.
[00:10:16.733 --> 00:10:17.613]  And look at Katrina.
[00:10:17.974 --> 00:10:19.094]  How are they going to respond?
[00:10:19.194 --> 00:10:27.177]  No, they're going to use disasters as a pretext to come in and confiscate guns and loot the wealthy houses, as happened in Katrina.
[00:10:27.577 --> 00:10:29.318]  Stay there, Stuart Rhodes, with Oath Keepers.
[00:10:30.038 --> 00:10:36.040]  Thousands and thousands of military and police taking the oath to not violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution and to upkeep their oath.
[00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:37.081]  We'll be right back.
[00:10:40.083 --> 00:10:46.572]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes.com, the makers of the highest quality vault doors and safes available.
[00:10:47.052 --> 00:10:49.736]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[00:10:50.096 --> 00:10:54.903]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[00:10:55.323 --> 00:10:55.563]  I think so.
[00:11:12.489 --> 00:11:17.710]  Graf Undersafes use only the highest quality heavy metals and cold steel locking bolts.
[00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.251]  Graf Undersafes are fire and burglar resistant and they even come with a lifetime warranty.

[00:11:40.194 --> 00:11:41.534]  It is a big idea
[00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:43.729]  A New World Order.
[00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.854]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:52.117]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:11:52.157 --> 00:11:54.399]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:11:54.939 --> 00:11:57.381]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:11:58.142 --> 00:12:05.468]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:12:08.482 --> 00:12:13.443]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:12:13.903 --> 00:12:17.404]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:12:17.764 --> 00:12:20.285]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:12:20.345 --> 00:12:21.485]  Most people have no idea.
[00:12:21.505 --> 00:12:22.266]  They're not after money.
[00:12:22.286 --> 00:12:23.386]  They have all the money they need.
[00:12:23.586 --> 00:12:24.306]  They're after power.
[00:12:24.546 --> 00:12:25.407]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:13:39.697 --> 00:13:48.525]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[00:14:34.366 --> 00:14:52.878]  Stuart Rhodes, he started Oath Keepers in the last year or so, and it's really exploded in size.
[00:14:52.898 --> 00:14:56.281]  We'll give you the website before he leaves us and some of the testimonials.
[00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:01.063]  The government is clearly out of line.
[00:15:01.563 --> 00:15:03.545]  It's violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:15:03.585 --> 00:15:05.226]  It's run by foreign offshore banks.
[00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:08.488]  They've stolen almost $24 trillion the last 10 months.
[00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.832]  Obama has proven he's a liar on every front.
[00:15:14.293 --> 00:15:25.942]  And then magically, they put out DHS reports saying that all these evil American gun owners are about to attack the President.
[00:15:27.236 --> 00:15:35.858]  And right on cue, the Southern Poverty Law Center comes out with a report demonizing all these good people, mixing us in with clearly bad folks.
[00:15:36.778 --> 00:15:40.779]  And then now ABC News is doing it, and I saw this before Oklahoma City.
[00:15:41.819 --> 00:15:48.520]  So before the feds stage terror attacks so that they can be the victims and clamp down on freedom, they do this.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.880]  This is the preparatory phase.
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.141]  Stewart, do you smell a false flag in the wind?
[00:15:55.436 --> 00:16:06.558]  I think we're heading to the territory where they could use a pretext such as the flu itself to, this appears to be what they're doing, is setting up all the infrastructure and all the planning and all the rhetoric.
[00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:14.773]  So that all you have to do is click the button, click the switch, and the blue pops up and the next thing you know that they've imposed martial law.
[00:16:14.893 --> 00:16:23.317]  I want to go back to a second where we were talking about a minute ago, you're right, about the first line, as I said, should be that the states should have deputy permission.
[00:16:23.677 --> 00:16:32.121]  But then you look at Article 1, Section 8 also says that Congress has the power to call forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrection, rebel invasion.
[00:16:32.785 --> 00:16:33.607]  We're good to go.
[00:16:45.556 --> 00:17:03.406]  And then your legislature that you've elected is in charge, so when you see troops coming down the street, they are from your town, your city, you know their daddy, you know their mama, or you might even be their granddaddy, and the legislature commanding them, the governor commanding them, you voted for them.
[00:17:03.846 --> 00:17:05.747]  That is the people ruling.
[00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:14.728]  And only, you can only have outside militia from somewhere else if that legislature in your state, your governor, invites them in.
[00:17:15.529 --> 00:17:16.230]  Okay?
[00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.014]  And nothing there is contemplating the standing army doing anything inside the United States.
[00:17:20.535 --> 00:17:21.396]  Supposed to be the militia.
[00:17:23.413 --> 00:17:29.440]  The standing army defends the nation's borders and has a navy to defend, but it doesn't have any action inside.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.863]  Have you seen the editorial cartoon of the United States?
[00:17:31.923 --> 00:17:36.389]  It says Homeland Security with all the cannons swung in, pointed inside the country?
[00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:37.731]  And that's what's happening.
[00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:40.614]  Everything that Bush created is now being turned inward.
[00:17:41.235 --> 00:17:42.016]  All that infrastructure.
[00:17:42.975 --> 00:17:46.597]  And so we are so far from our, you know, the original intention of the Founders.
[00:17:46.837 --> 00:17:48.558]  Forget about the Prostitution and Commodities Act.
[00:17:48.598 --> 00:17:49.458]  That's only a statute.
[00:17:49.838 --> 00:17:51.739]  Look at the design of the Constitution itself.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.601]  We're wildly beyond what they intended.
[00:17:54.621 --> 00:17:58.823]  They wanted the militia of the state to be the internal security force.
[00:17:58.843 --> 00:17:59.343]  That'd be us.
[00:17:59.863 --> 00:18:01.184]  How are we going to interiorize ourselves?
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.141]  You can't.
[00:18:03.161 --> 00:18:04.121]  That was their insight.
[00:18:18.888 --> 00:18:22.390]  They want a clone, but a evil doppelganger.
[00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:27.492]  They want a twisted militia that's a federal militia, and they go, well that's in the Constitution.
[00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:28.873]  So they try to have it both ways.
[00:18:28.893 --> 00:18:33.075]  They demonize a real militia, but then they have their counterfeit federal militia.
[00:18:33.335 --> 00:18:35.516]  Can you explain to people from the Constitution the difference?
[00:18:36.596 --> 00:18:43.019]  Well sure, as it says in the statement itself, a well-regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state.
[00:18:43.419 --> 00:18:44.880]  The militias are from the states
[00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:47.056]  Not from the national government.
[00:18:47.316 --> 00:18:48.177]  That's not a militia.
[00:18:48.557 --> 00:18:52.798]  When the national government hires someone to do anything, they are now part of a national government.
[00:18:52.818 --> 00:18:54.678]  They're not part of the state structure.
[00:18:55.138 --> 00:18:56.999]  And so it's entirely opposite, as you said.
[00:18:57.059 --> 00:18:59.519]  It's like the evil twin of a militia.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.160]  It's more like the Brown Shirts or the Stasi.
[00:19:10.123 --> 00:19:12.065]  I hope that the Southern Poverty Law Center gets this quote.
[00:19:12.125 --> 00:19:15.768]  We are the opposite of the brown shirts, or the male brigades, the youth brigades.
[00:19:16.108 --> 00:19:20.712]  This is the real people's army, not their wicked counterfeit.
[00:19:20.752 --> 00:19:21.092]  Go ahead.
[00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:22.193]  That's right.
[00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:26.557]  They're trying to create a new version.
[00:19:27.217 --> 00:19:28.619]  They're adopting the old forms.
[00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:29.339]  This is what happens.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.282]  They'll adopt the old forms and they'll twist them.
[00:19:32.662 --> 00:19:34.864]  And it's something that's been done throughout history.
[00:19:35.384 --> 00:19:38.307]  Every oppressive regime always takes the law and turns it into a weapon.
[00:19:38.849 --> 00:19:41.611]  And they'll adopt the forms and bastardize them.
[00:19:41.911 --> 00:19:43.573]  Orwell warned us about this many years ago.
[00:19:44.173 --> 00:19:45.534]  So it should be a surprise.
[00:19:45.975 --> 00:19:47.116]  But we have to be on guard.
[00:19:47.336 --> 00:19:49.517]  And the first line is your state's sovereignty.
[00:19:50.018 --> 00:19:51.799]  You have to have, in fact, this is what needs to happen.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:20:06.671]  State legislatures need to convene special sessions to discuss and to come to conclusions and pass resolutions about the claimed authority of NORTHCOM and FEMA and DHS to come into their state during a pandemic.
[00:20:07.825 --> 00:20:09.466]  Stuart, Stuart, we got a break.
[00:20:09.506 --> 00:20:12.967]  Let's come back and talk about that and then get into the First Amendment overall.
[00:20:13.347 --> 00:20:21.450]  But yes, we now have the Governor's Association sending a letter to the White House and the Pentagon saying, you're going to put troops on the streets?
[00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.751]  And the Army's answer is, yeah.
[00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:26.132]  It was 20,000 last year.
[00:20:26.472 --> 00:20:26.792]  Now it's 400,000.
[00:20:28.153 --> 00:20:29.573]  Will it be a million next year?
[00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:31.154]  We're on the march.
[00:20:31.634 --> 00:20:33.235]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:20:34.155 --> 00:20:36.836]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:44.722]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:20:44.942 --> 00:20:48.725]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:20:48.965 --> 00:20:54.530]  Number two, our new Energy Czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:55.310]  It's true.
[00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:00.451]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:21:00.852 --> 00:21:06.293]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:09.794]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:21:10.034 --> 00:21:14.255]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:21:14.555 --> 00:21:18.156]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:21:18.396 --> 00:21:23.902]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:21:24.142 --> 00:21:28.687]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:21:40.011 --> 00:21:42.614]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:21:43.014 --> 00:21:47.979]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:21:48.339 --> 00:21:50.081]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:21:50.401 --> 00:21:55.206]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:21:55.386 --> 00:21:56.327]  How much do you want?
[00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:57.308]  When do you want it?
[00:21:57.688 --> 00:21:59.290]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:21:59.571 --> 00:22:00.412]  When will you need it?
[00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:02.714]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:03.956]  Will there be any food?
[00:22:04.196 --> 00:22:05.538]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:22:05.718 --> 00:22:10.804]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:22:11.004 --> 00:22:14.128]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:22:14.568 --> 00:22:18.069]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:22:18.369 --> 00:22:19.369]  How much will you need?
[00:22:19.609 --> 00:22:20.229]  We don't know.
[00:22:20.509 --> 00:22:21.409]  How much do you want?
[00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.350]  All you can get.
[00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.390]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.411]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:22:26.691 --> 00:22:28.871]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:22:28.891 --> 00:22:29.891]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:22:40.475 --> 00:22:44.460]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.603]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:22:48.024 --> 00:22:55.833]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[00:22:56.073 --> 00:22:57.994]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[00:22:58.314 --> 00:23:00.276]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[00:23:00.696 --> 00:23:07.140]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:13.244]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[00:23:13.684 --> 00:23:15.925]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[00:23:16.285 --> 00:23:23.669]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.272]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A, utopiasilver.com.
[00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:31.772]  Or call us today at 1-888-213-4338.
[00:23:31.792 --> 00:23:31.852]  1-888-213-4338.
[00:23:42.777 --> 00:23:44.078]  We're good to go.
[00:24:04.694 --> 00:24:07.075]  The globalists have a couple of things going for them.
[00:24:07.276 --> 00:24:26.987]  They've got the central government, they've got the unlimited power of the central banks to issue fiat, made-up currency, and their plan is so diabolical, so wicked, so corrupt, it's like wilder than a James Bond evil villain plot.
[00:24:28.428 --> 00:24:32.250]  I mean, the movie Moonraker about a plan to set up a world government and kill everybody,
[00:24:33.274 --> 00:24:37.318]  You know, they got the plots for that from real government documents, like Ecoscience.
[00:24:38.639 --> 00:24:42.143]  Fleming, the work for the MI6 that wrote the books, admitted that.
[00:24:44.245 --> 00:24:52.033]  And he did write Moonraker, under another name, but I forget the exact name of it, it wasn't Moonraker, but the point is that
[00:24:56.482 --> 00:25:00.444]  They've got that going for them, but once people find out, this is really true.
[00:25:00.464 --> 00:25:13.511]  I mean, when I get up on air and go, here's the Army purchase orders for FEMA camps, here's the Army hiring people for domestic internment and resettlement programs, you know, here's the actual code on it.
[00:25:13.531 --> 00:25:25.218]  When I show you mainstream news articles, this is out of The Hill, you know, big major newspaper in D.C., and it says, Governors oppose DOD emergency powers.
[00:25:26.564 --> 00:25:29.626]  And they sent a letter, the heads of the Governor's Association, saying, what is this?
[00:25:30.107 --> 00:25:32.548]  You can't federalize the states and put troops on the streets.
[00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:36.291]  They were responding to what now has come out in the news.
[00:25:39.553 --> 00:25:42.315]  And that is these reports out of the AP and the Progressive.
[00:25:42.395 --> 00:25:45.137]  Governors oppose DOD emergency powers.
[00:25:47.619 --> 00:25:49.861]  And then that other headline I was mentioning.
[00:25:50.894 --> 00:25:57.375]  Earlier, the Pentagon wants authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[00:25:57.976 --> 00:26:04.537]  And then I've got articles here where they're training to take over the cities and admitting that they're going to do it.
[00:26:04.577 --> 00:26:06.878]  In fact, I had that here in my stack.
[00:26:07.738 --> 00:26:12.259]  National Guard takes over school and swine flu vaccine riot drill.
[00:26:12.979 --> 00:26:17.480]  And then I can go back a few years and pull up stuff like the Pensacola News Journal.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:28.263]  Where the Marines, unannounced, take over the middle school, point guns at the kids' heads, the kids think it's real, and then the Marines say, oh, the President wants you to know what martial law is like.
[00:26:28.583 --> 00:26:29.804]  That was in the newspaper.
[00:26:30.184 --> 00:26:33.245]  Folks, this is a real program going on.
[00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:43.788]  Stuart Rhodes, with all of this backdrop happening, and then we've got the Southern Poverty Law Center coming out and viciously attacking you and I and others, nationally.
[00:26:44.148 --> 00:26:45.649]  I mean, this report is being
[00:26:46.658 --> 00:26:50.080]  One of the top news stories the last three days on every major newscast.
[00:26:51.861 --> 00:26:56.984]  Does that creep you out, but at the same time make you proud that you're actually having an effect?
[00:26:57.364 --> 00:27:01.887]  To know that over and over again, myself especially, get singled out as this enemy?
[00:27:02.587 --> 00:27:09.051]  I mean, the full government focus is on us and trying to demonize these town halls.
[00:27:10.162 --> 00:27:10.542]  That's right.
[00:27:10.802 --> 00:27:11.923]  I mean, here's the bottom line.
[00:27:11.943 --> 00:27:13.524]  This is why I founded Oath Keepers in the first place.
[00:27:13.904 --> 00:27:14.865]  The head is rotten.
[00:27:15.325 --> 00:27:19.588]  We have to focus from the bottom up, from the can level on up in our state legislatures.
[00:27:19.968 --> 00:27:25.892]  But then we might run out of time, and that's why I founded Oath Keepers, to be sure that, or at least do the best we can.
[00:27:26.292 --> 00:27:27.293]  Well, you just made a great point.
[00:27:50.205 --> 00:28:09.447]  When we've got the government documents attacking us and attacking Ron Paul and attacking libertarians and attacking returning veterans and gun owners, that is absolute proof that they are bad and that our analysis of their system was correct and that my only apology is, Mr. Rhodes, is that I...
[00:28:09.967 --> 00:28:17.490]  As bad as I said it was, I haven't told the audience and fully grasped myself just how real this is.
[00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.272]  I mean, intellectually knowing something is happening.
[00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:23.233]  Intellectually knowing it hurts to be in a car wreck.
[00:28:25.157 --> 00:28:33.981]  And you know, flip your car is one thing, but actually being in the car, breaking your ribs, knocking your head out the window, getting 20 stitches is another thing.
[00:28:34.701 --> 00:28:41.164]  I mean, intellectually, I know getting the flu doesn't feel good, but when you're actually vomiting your guts out, it's a different thing.
[00:28:42.325 --> 00:28:43.225]  Can you comment on that?
[00:28:43.305 --> 00:28:44.726]  I mean, to actually see this happening.
[00:28:45.404 --> 00:28:46.145]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:28:46.165 --> 00:29:00.600]  Look back at HR 1955, Jane Harman's proposal, the Radical Racialization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act, where they wanted to set up a center of excellence to study people and give secret reports to Congress.
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.040]  Remember that?
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:08.708]  And she introduced that on April 19, 2007, because even back then, her real target was domestic enemies.
[00:29:09.693 --> 00:29:11.819]  Yeah, for those that don't know, that's like a police code.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.590]  When they say April 19th, that's when the war started.
[00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:16.432]  Explain that to people.
[00:29:17.119 --> 00:29:17.459]  Oh, you bet!
[00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:40.027]  I mean, we stood in the green in Lexington April 19th, this last April, to commemorate, you know, as all kinds of citizens do, to celebrate our heritage and also to reaffirm our oaths, but according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, that's a kind of sinister indication that we are extremists, because supposedly April 19th is equivalent to celebrating Oklahoma City's, the blowing up of the Oklahoma City building.
[00:29:40.367 --> 00:29:44.448]  So, you know, in their minds, if you do anything April 19th, it makes you an extremist.
[00:29:44.868 --> 00:29:45.469]  Not an American.
[00:29:47.209 --> 00:29:52.633]  The globalists hate America, that's why they burned Waco on April 19th and used special forces against those children.
[00:29:52.953 --> 00:29:55.395]  We have the congressional documents with Delta Force there.
[00:29:56.015 --> 00:30:01.139]  And that's why they bombed Oklahoma City on April 19th, was to take that day away from us.
[00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:08.864]  They want to take our sacred days and expropriate them and turn it into a day of victimization for their red coat system.
[00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:12.918]  Well, they want to demonize it, they want to erase our own history.
[00:30:13.558 --> 00:30:14.558]  So here's what's happening.
[00:30:14.598 --> 00:30:18.420]  What she wanted to do is being done anyway, even though the bill didn't pass.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.281]  And Southern Poverty Law Center is just another facet of that.
[00:30:22.501 --> 00:30:31.304]  They are acting as the Gestapo secret police wing to go ahead and label people, instead of having the FBI do it directly.
[00:30:31.864 --> 00:30:32.665]  They do it for them.
[00:30:32.886 --> 00:30:37.452]  And then DHS feeds off of their fake little reports and comes up with their own report.
[00:30:37.772 --> 00:30:42.358]  And then you've got Southern Primary Law Center then citing the DHS report they held right.
[00:30:42.378 --> 00:30:46.063]  I mean, it's this vicious circle like a puppeteer with two puppets in his hand.
[00:30:46.323 --> 00:30:47.445]  It's all the same puppet master.
[00:30:48.194 --> 00:30:56.863]  So, and the whole point is to demonize, marginalize, make someone a target, make them outside of the society's protection, and then they stick the dogs on you.
[00:30:56.943 --> 00:31:00.747]  Then they stick the military on you, if they can, or they stick the police on you, at least.
[00:31:01.207 --> 00:31:04.150]  Well, that's what Hitler did, that's what Lenin did, that's what Mao did.
[00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:10.156]  First, for four or five years, in every case, they demonize the group, then they go after you.
[00:31:10.877 --> 00:31:25.185]  and uh... you know we got the secret army document that regular army is watching us and ron paul and that became national news the good news is though it's backfiring because the military's going why am i spying on wayne paul
[00:31:25.785 --> 00:31:27.386]  Why am I spying on Alex Jones?
[00:31:27.446 --> 00:31:29.028]  Why am I spying on Ron Paul?
[00:31:29.548 --> 00:31:31.370]  Why am I spying on Stuart Rhodes?
[00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:37.374]  Why are we following around some little old lady that's handing out yard signs to end the Fed?
[00:31:38.415 --> 00:31:46.782]  I mean, I really think the establishment is trying to do the same thing the bankers funded in Russia and China and Germany, and I don't see it working.
[00:31:48.351 --> 00:31:49.172]  It's ridiculous.
[00:31:49.192 --> 00:31:57.177]  The extremist lexicon defined an extremist as being the same as a terrorist, and then it went down the list of all these so-called extremist groups.
[00:31:57.318 --> 00:31:59.819]  So we're all automatically terrorists, or just different stripes of terrorists.
[00:32:12.128 --> 00:32:15.570]  This person's an anti-abortion terrorist.
[00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:20.372]  This person here is an anti-abortion or anti-free border terrorist.
[00:32:20.692 --> 00:32:22.432]  So they label you different kinds of terrorists.
[00:32:22.813 --> 00:32:27.294]  But they pool us all together in one big giant pool of extremists.
[00:32:27.735 --> 00:32:28.615]  Which means terrorists.
[00:32:28.755 --> 00:32:34.277]  And so it's so broad and so sweeping that anyone can see through it and see how ridiculous it really is.
[00:32:34.678 --> 00:32:35.878]  Unless they're a partisan hack.
[00:32:36.438 --> 00:32:40.220]  Well, Stuart, you also noticed that everybody they list in that DHS report
[00:32:41.761 --> 00:33:02.663]  are people that are following something that's constitutional and it happens to be popular eighty one percent gallup poll control the borders demonized almost eighty percent savers i get rid of a trick to gun laws we're winning that fight we're terrorists uh... upwards of seventy percent now are against abortion so the majority of us are terrorists uh... this is an unpopular
[00:33:03.615 --> 00:33:07.979]  Well, it's like national polls show 92% believe the government killed Kennedy now.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.524]  I mean, so 8% is saying 92% of us are nuts or terrorists.
[00:33:12.884 --> 00:33:14.346]  It isn't going to work anymore.
[00:33:14.886 --> 00:33:19.551]  I mean, look, the feds might have been able to get away with blowing up their own federal building in 95.
[00:33:20.051 --> 00:33:21.533]  They might have been able to get away with that now.
[00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:25.957]  I want to caution the black op operators and the mercenaries and others.
[00:33:26.758 --> 00:33:30.260]  Cheney's been caught for staging terror in the Middle East to blame it on enemies.
[00:33:31.181 --> 00:33:32.582]  It's coming out about Blackwater.
[00:33:32.902 --> 00:33:38.165]  You guys aren't going to get away with this because there's people on the inside that are going to blow the whistle from so many angles.
[00:33:38.625 --> 00:33:39.466]  You're going to get caught.
[00:33:39.846 --> 00:33:44.609]  And I really, Stuart, feel, but also intellectually see, the momentum has shifted.
[00:33:44.969 --> 00:33:48.271]  Now for leaders like you and myself, they may imprison us or kill us, but
[00:33:48.991 --> 00:33:52.152]  We're actually fighting for America in the final battle.
[00:33:52.272 --> 00:33:54.332]  I mean, in the main crossroads.
[00:33:54.512 --> 00:33:55.432]  So I'm not even worried about it.
[00:33:55.472 --> 00:33:56.053]  It's a great honor.
[00:33:56.233 --> 00:33:57.373]  I wish I had more lives to give.
[00:33:57.833 --> 00:34:05.055]  But for the people out there, if you simply take action, get the word out, expose the globalists, I don't see us being able to be defeated.
[00:34:05.355 --> 00:34:09.976]  Even if they blow up federal buildings, even if the feds set off a nuke, even if they release some deadly flu.
[00:34:10.456 --> 00:34:12.236]  Stewart, I've looked at this from every angle.
[00:34:12.756 --> 00:34:15.497]  If the people believe they can win, it's over.
[00:34:15.697 --> 00:34:16.017]  We win.
[00:34:17.865 --> 00:34:24.451]  Absolutely, and here's the thing, if we wake up enough of the police and military, as I said in that prior interview, then it's game over for them.
[00:34:24.471 --> 00:34:31.477]  You know, you can't do these things without the willing compliance of the troops, you know, of the police.
[00:34:32.558 --> 00:34:38.944]  If they have them on their side, then it's still not over for us, we can still fight, but certainly it's better for us to have our brothers and sisters
[00:34:41.661 --> 00:34:42.482]  I think so.
[00:34:50.242 --> 00:34:53.305]  Including an Oath Keepers guidebook and a tab you can put on their uniform.
[00:34:53.605 --> 00:34:55.927]  We want to get those out to every single service member.
[00:34:56.247 --> 00:35:00.511]  So we're going to be doing a big money wave between now and November 11th, which is the Veterans Day.
[00:35:01.031 --> 00:35:07.456]  And it's going to go into a distinct fund where people can just donate $30 and it will go right to, in the hands of a service member, current serving.
[00:35:07.677 --> 00:35:10.299]  They'll know that every time they do that, it's going to end that result.
[00:35:10.759 --> 00:35:12.440]  And it's Oath-Keepers.blogspot.com
[00:35:18.473 --> 00:35:21.557]  Oathkeepers.org will also get that up.
[00:35:21.637 --> 00:35:27.625]  I want to go to some phone calls, Stuart, in the time we have left for you, but I did want to mention the Joker posters.
[00:35:28.827 --> 00:35:34.375]  These were put up in California that Mark Dice had his own contest, so I copied him, did a contest.
[00:35:35.689 --> 00:35:41.431]  But, a few people put these on post office boxes, big deal, but they're saying, oh, big federal felony terrorism.
[00:35:41.711 --> 00:35:46.652]  Now they're saying it's an act of terror, and abusive, and there's victims.
[00:35:47.032 --> 00:35:54.254]  If you even put it up where other posters are, they're saying the poster itself is racist, that it's a hate crime to say socialism.
[00:35:54.574 --> 00:35:56.034]  I'm not kidding, that's in the news.
[00:35:56.614 --> 00:35:59.375]  And they have people on the news saying, I need to be arrested.
[00:35:59.955 --> 00:36:02.456]  That's content-based discrimination.
[00:36:03.496 --> 00:36:06.558]  It's content-based targeting, because like you just said, they're targeting the content.
[00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:09.139]  It's not content-neutral.
[00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:10.539]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:11.840]  Yeah, because you're a constitutional lawyer.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.741]  I was going to ask your opinion.
[00:36:13.301 --> 00:36:16.082]  So clearly this is discrimination then.
[00:36:16.582 --> 00:36:16.943]  Oh sure.
[00:36:17.283 --> 00:36:21.925]  At the ACLU, they'll tell you the same thing, I hope, is that it's clearly content-based.
[00:36:21.985 --> 00:36:25.167]  Are they doing the same thing to everybody else but the supplier?
[00:36:25.387 --> 00:36:25.907]  No, they're not.
[00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:27.820]  So it's based on your content.
[00:36:28.261 --> 00:36:29.242]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:36:29.262 --> 00:36:31.003]  I don't care what you're saying.
[00:36:31.023 --> 00:36:38.750]  You can have the Klan putting up a swastika, and if they are singled out because of the content, that's also content-based discrimination.
[00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:43.294]  That's why the ACLU defended the Klan's right to march through Skokie, Illinois.
[00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:49.360]  As painful and horrible as that was, it was to protect the principle that you don't discriminate on content.
[00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:59.094]  Because the minute that the Klan, every one of them federal officers, I've been to these events to protest them, I mean, it's just feds, period.
[00:36:59.575 --> 00:37:13.805]  And it's come out over and over again, it's feds to demonize the Patriot Movement, because they'll get up there and give pro-Second Amendment speeches, they'll get up there and give anti-New World Order speeches, all to demonize us, and later it comes out they're feds or informants or, you know, the leaders are being paid to do it.
[00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:18.148]  But yeah, you take those big fat federal agents right away,
[00:37:19.068 --> 00:37:20.009]  You lose your right.
[00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:24.275]  And that's why these people sending me emails saying I deserve to go to prison.
[00:37:24.895 --> 00:37:28.340]  That just shows they haven't been teaching civics in the schools.
[00:37:29.107 --> 00:37:30.648]  No, they don't understand their own history.
[00:37:31.088 --> 00:37:36.232]  I mean, the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s would have gone nowhere if you could have content-based discrimination.
[00:37:36.332 --> 00:37:40.274]  That's why they resorted to peaceful marches, because they have a constitutional right.
[00:37:40.754 --> 00:37:48.219]  The First Amendment, sadly, the other parts of the Bill of Rights aren't as strongly protected, but the First Amendment has been pretty strongly protected.
[00:37:48.639 --> 00:37:50.801]  It's the most potent weapon we have legally.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.542]  As far as the level of protection for it.
[00:37:53.642 --> 00:37:54.924]  And you can thank the ACLU for that.
[00:37:54.944 --> 00:37:55.845]  They did some things right.
[00:38:05.299 --> 00:38:13.781]  What is their view on seeing all this classic, really malice, is the closest thing I would call it, tyranny manifesting?
[00:38:14.982 --> 00:38:17.803]  Are they redoubling their efforts to warn other military and police?
[00:38:17.823 --> 00:38:25.265]  I mean, clearly, if the government organs and government surrogates like Southern Poverty Law are coming after you, they are.
[00:38:26.325 --> 00:38:29.826]  But, I mean, what's the sense of the membership?
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.662]  Yeah, it's making them all the more resolved.
[00:38:33.922 --> 00:38:41.205]  And, like you said earlier, it makes it clear that we are in the game now, that we all had read it would be coming.
[00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:42.706]  It's happening to us right now.
[00:38:43.086 --> 00:38:52.471]  And so we are hearing back, with Active Duty, back at that Active Duty guy right now on our blog, our site, who are saying, I am making sure I spread this as far and as fast as possible.
[00:38:52.711 --> 00:38:53.432]  We want to help them.
[00:38:53.452 --> 00:38:56.134]  We want to put billboards up outside of bases.
[00:38:56.214 --> 00:38:57.655]  We want to make sure we get a care package.
[00:38:57.695 --> 00:39:01.677]  My goal is to have a care package in the hands of 40,000 active duty troops by Christmas.
[00:39:01.697 --> 00:39:02.878]  So that's my goal.
[00:39:02.978 --> 00:39:04.840]  And we're starting state networks, too.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:18.609]  We now have state chapters with state directors, and our goal is to have an active Oath Keeper chapter in every county of the state to make sure the Sheriff is squared away, make sure the police there know who the veterans are, they all become friends, they all know they have each other's back.
[00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:22.232]  That's our goal, is to make sure that we've got our counties squared away from the bottom up.
[00:39:23.178 --> 00:39:30.423]  Oh, and Sheriff Mack, in fact, speaking of sheriffs, has a response to Southern Poverty Law Center that he just sent me.
[00:39:30.443 --> 00:39:31.584]  We just posted it on our site.
[00:39:31.904 --> 00:39:35.526]  So if folks want to go to Oaktreepers.org, they can read his well-reasoned response.
[00:39:36.027 --> 00:39:41.951]  And also, Lieutenant Commander Gilley, who's an active commander, who was with us last weekend, is writing his response.
[00:39:42.271 --> 00:39:43.692]  We'll post that as soon as he sends it in.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:53.888]  Well, good, because if we give in to this chilling effect, in fact, next Wednesday I'll announce the winners to the great Obama poster contest.
[00:39:54.368 --> 00:39:58.952]  But I'm going to go ahead and next week announce another contest to keep this going.
[00:39:59.793 --> 00:40:04.036]  Regardless, all of you that put posters up, one, be sure and follow your local laws.
[00:40:04.076 --> 00:40:06.719]  Don't give these thugs excuses to selectively enforce on you.
[00:40:08.055 --> 00:40:17.603]  But because they're trying to threaten me, because they're telling me I don't have a First Amendment, but Obama could be in the Washington Post saying, put my posters up on stop signs.
[00:40:17.644 --> 00:40:19.385]  He's saying do something illegal, we're not.
[00:40:19.765 --> 00:40:23.108]  But they're saying we're not even allowed to legally say this.
[00:40:23.669 --> 00:40:25.170]  I'm not giving in to this intimidation.
[00:40:29.775 --> 00:40:30.295]  Well, thank you, Stuart.
[00:40:30.315 --> 00:40:31.376]  I want your take on this in a moment.
[00:40:31.596 --> 00:40:34.957]  I just wanted to tell the people, if we give in to the intimidation, they win.
[00:40:35.257 --> 00:40:38.799]  They wouldn't be going absolutely crazy over this, though, if it wasn't scaring them.
[00:40:39.079 --> 00:40:48.582]  And just the exercise of people out putting things up, just the exercise of getting off your butts, is a literal psychological and spiritual shift.
[00:40:48.923 --> 00:40:49.603]  Stuart comments.
[00:40:52.577 --> 00:40:54.998]  After a while, everyone was running around spray-painting bees.
[00:40:55.999 --> 00:41:00.221]  And whether the state decrees it okay or not, you should exercise your First Amendment right.
[00:41:00.761 --> 00:41:01.702]  I've got an idea for you.
[00:41:01.762 --> 00:41:03.022]  How about one that says Oathbreaker?
[00:41:05.464 --> 00:41:06.584]  Below the picture.
[00:41:07.745 --> 00:41:08.485]  That's a good idea.
[00:41:08.505 --> 00:41:09.186]  Oathbreaker.
[00:41:09.266 --> 00:41:09.826]  Or liar.
[00:41:10.666 --> 00:41:13.228]  I mean, he's been caught lying about everything he said he'd do.
[00:41:14.528 --> 00:41:15.069]  Liar.
[00:41:15.629 --> 00:41:17.970]  But the response should be to go out there and do it more.
[00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:19.431]  That should be the response.
[00:41:21.141 --> 00:41:22.782]  Well, that's what the listeners are doing.
[00:41:22.862 --> 00:41:24.362]  I said, listeners, I said, be careful.
[00:41:24.402 --> 00:41:25.442]  And the listeners are going, no.
[00:41:25.462 --> 00:41:27.743]  And they're doing it to police stations.
[00:41:28.363 --> 00:41:31.664]  So the spirit of 1776 is alive and well.
[00:41:32.344 --> 00:41:37.206]  And I would caution the police and military to think twice about what side of history they want to be on.
[00:41:37.446 --> 00:41:39.046]  Your gut tells you to join us.
[00:41:39.907 --> 00:41:41.407]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:41:41.607 --> 00:41:43.048]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:41:43.348 --> 00:41:45.568]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:41:46.029 --> 00:41:50.750]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:41:51.152 --> 00:41:54.015]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:42:14.554 --> 00:42:16.996]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:42:17.236 --> 00:42:17.797]  We're good.
[00:42:40.595 --> 00:42:42.457]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.

[00:43:40.285 --> 00:43:45.612]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:43:46.312 --> 00:43:51.659]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:43:52.199 --> 00:43:58.367]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:43:58.687 --> 00:44:00.508]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:00.648 --> 00:44:03.049]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:03.129 --> 00:44:14.053]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:44:16.293 --> 00:44:17.594]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:17.974 --> 00:44:19.375]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:19.835 --> 00:44:26.057]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:44:35.003 --> 00:44:36.145]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:36.585 --> 00:44:37.787]  The people strike back!
[00:44:56.411 --> 00:45:05.673]  Alright, we're going to keep Stewart five minutes in the next hour so we can get to your calls.
[00:45:06.293 --> 00:45:08.234]  Let's talk to Brian in New York.
[00:45:08.294 --> 00:45:10.454]  You're on the air with fellow thought criminal.
[00:45:10.814 --> 00:45:13.935]  He dare ask the military and police to keep their oath.
[00:45:16.756 --> 00:45:17.916]  Go ahead Brian, you're on the air.
[00:45:17.936 --> 00:45:20.157]  Okay.
[00:45:21.516 --> 00:45:22.577]  Brian in New York's not there.
[00:45:22.597 --> 00:45:24.337]  Let's go to Brian in Jersey.
[00:45:24.697 --> 00:45:25.898]  Go ahead, Brian, you're on the air.
[00:45:25.918 --> 00:45:26.738]  Hey, Alex.
[00:45:27.579 --> 00:45:27.779]  Hey.
[00:45:28.419 --> 00:45:28.979]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:45:28.999 --> 00:45:34.462]  The comment I wanted to make, actually, was regarding Obama saying to put his signs on stop signs and whatnot.
[00:45:34.482 --> 00:45:36.163]  I actually think that might be a good idea.
[00:45:36.183 --> 00:45:40.685]  Imagine if half the street corners in this country had signs that said, Stop Obama.
[00:45:42.085 --> 00:45:49.289]  Yeah, but see, you can put a sign up that shows him as God or looks like Stalin with him looking like this going...
[00:45:50.057 --> 00:45:56.943]  But the minute you put one up defiling his godliness, the locals just flip out.
[00:45:57.183 --> 00:46:02.247]  The government comes out and lies and says, everyone in the town hates it, it's racist, remove it.
[00:46:02.507 --> 00:46:08.772]  And that's why the elite wanted him in office, was so they could play the race card anytime you disagree with him.
[00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:11.234]  It's just, I think it's blowing up in their face though.
[00:46:11.614 --> 00:46:13.816]  I mean, now you can't say the word socialist?
[00:46:15.558 --> 00:46:19.281]  Let's get a comment on what Brian said from Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeeper.
[00:46:20.503 --> 00:46:22.325]  Yeah, I mean, there's a tough line to walk there.
[00:46:22.525 --> 00:46:32.915]  You want to respect the property and the public safety of your city, but then you also want to have an active defiance.
[00:46:32.955 --> 00:46:39.061]  So I can't recommend that they go out and break the law, but let me just say you should exercise your personal rights.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.061]  Rigorously and fully.
[00:46:41.521 --> 00:46:49.526]  Well Stuart, why do you think I'm getting sent the videos of people saying, we're just going to put them on police stations now.
[00:46:49.686 --> 00:46:51.027]  And I'm telling people, don't do it.
[00:46:51.307 --> 00:47:02.595]  But the spirit of 1776 is so strong, I wonder if the police know down the road, if the new order comes in, that it's not going to be street signs.
[00:47:03.422 --> 00:47:05.083]  Well, you shouldn't look at the cops as your enemy.
[00:47:05.223 --> 00:47:07.344]  I mean, this is what they want you to do.
[00:47:07.464 --> 00:47:08.504]  Yes, they want this.
[00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:11.065]  They want that, so I would recommend not doing that.
[00:47:11.325 --> 00:47:13.306]  You put that on town hall, city hall.
[00:47:13.726 --> 00:47:17.388]  You put that on another oath-breaker's house or something like that.
[00:47:17.408 --> 00:47:20.949]  You don't put it on the police officer's property.
[00:47:21.169 --> 00:47:28.292]  For now, give them the benefit of the doubt that they are going to do what's right, and let them see you as their ally, not their opponent.
[00:47:28.332 --> 00:47:29.033]  No, no, I agree.
[00:47:29.073 --> 00:47:31.834]  That's why I'm saying that this needs to be done.
[00:47:32.754 --> 00:47:32.974]  Right.
[00:47:33.014 --> 00:47:34.514]  But, uh, anything else, Brian?
[00:47:34.534 --> 00:47:38.756]  I don't know, I'm just saying, just, you know, do what the, uh, President said, suggested you do.
[00:47:38.816 --> 00:47:43.137]  If he wants his name on stop signs, you know, just imagine what that message would actually say.
[00:47:43.217 --> 00:47:43.937]  Stop Obama.
[00:47:44.437 --> 00:47:59.400]  Well, what would happen if they arrest somebody putting it on a stop sign, or maybe below the sign so it doesn't endanger public safety, and then you get a ticket or arrested, you can go in with the official letterhead of the President telling his constituents to do it, is the court then gonna go after Obama?
[00:48:00.401 --> 00:48:01.001]  Uh, no.
[00:48:04.485 --> 00:48:05.606]  Go ahead.
[00:48:05.646 --> 00:48:12.692]  No, it's not going to stop the course, but it's going to stop, you know, it'll probably say, hey, listen, Obama said to do this, so I'm just following the President's orders.
[00:48:13.172 --> 00:48:14.834]  Alright, let's talk to John in Missouri.
[00:48:14.934 --> 00:48:16.335]  John in Missouri, make it quick, please, sir.
[00:48:16.375 --> 00:48:16.735]  Go ahead.
[00:48:17.836 --> 00:48:20.979]  Stuart, Alex, it's great to talk to two great American patriots.
[00:48:21.699 --> 00:48:23.060]  Keep up the good work, keep personal.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.143]  I got one point to make to all patriots out there.
[00:48:26.743 --> 00:48:33.309]  If they do press this issue and push the button, that all patriots need to know who the enemy is.
[00:48:34.048 --> 00:48:37.191]  So they can be singled out in the future so they can do their job.
[00:48:39.032 --> 00:48:40.874]  Know who the people in the CFR are.
[00:48:41.594 --> 00:48:57.927]  Know who are the people in the high command that have been acting treasonously against our country so that when you get the opportunity for making a citizen's arrest or a somewhat different approach they can know what their true enemy is.
[00:49:00.643 --> 00:49:04.106]  They wanted to attack Iran, but Fox Fallon said no.
[00:49:04.447 --> 00:49:07.389]  So, there are even some good people at the higher levels.
[00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:10.232]  We'll get Stuart Rhodes' takes on that when we get back.
[00:49:10.552 --> 00:49:11.032]  Thank you, John.
[00:49:11.052 --> 00:49:14.035]  We'll talk to Ryan, Dee, and Jeff, and others.
[00:49:14.375 --> 00:49:16.678]  Bob Chapman's coming up on the economy as well.
[00:49:21.162 --> 00:49:23.023]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:49:24.705 --> 00:49:26.687]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:49:29.462 --> 00:49:33.445]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:49:33.706 --> 00:49:35.487]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:49:35.707 --> 00:49:43.974]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:49:44.235 --> 00:49:49.459]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:51.401]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:49:51.641 --> 00:49:57.963]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:49:58.163 --> 00:50:08.907]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:50:09.208 --> 00:50:09.708]  That's right.
[00:50:09.968 --> 00:50:12.289]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:14.109]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:16.650]  Big Brother.
[00:50:45.564 --> 00:50:46.625]  Mainstream media.
[00:50:47.326 --> 00:50:48.428]  Government cover-ups.
[00:50:49.088 --> 00:50:49.909]  You want answers?
[00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:51.591]  Well, so does he.
[00:50:51.611 --> 00:50:55.916]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:56.437 --> 00:51:00.462]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.343 --> 00:51:09.126]  Stuart Rhodes isn't that the big issue, what the last caller was bringing up, that the establishment's playing a very dangerous game.
[00:51:09.546 --> 00:51:18.069]  They want to stir up resistance, but only enough to label it kooky and then demonize peaceful demonstrating, peaceful voting.
[00:51:19.226 --> 00:51:20.787]  Peaceful litigation.
[00:51:21.648 --> 00:51:28.174]  They want enough of a revolt to crack down, but not a big enough revolt where it's seen as widespread and then they lose.
[00:51:28.674 --> 00:51:34.620]  So I don't want to give them the revolt, the violent revolt, but I don't know if the establishment knows.
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.901]  I think they do to a certain extent.
[00:51:36.241 --> 00:51:43.387]  There really are probably about a million people that really don't want to live anymore and just want to go after globalists.
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:52:00.289]  You see the White House now apologizing, all these senators apologizing, saying, okay, we know you're mainstream, we know a lot of you are Democrats that don't want the health care and don't want the cap-and-trade, okay, we're sorry, yes, and so there's a total capitulation happening.
[00:52:01.009 --> 00:52:06.112]  I think this may have been them breaking and deciding to not go with a very hot summer and fall.
[00:52:06.533 --> 00:52:13.517]  I'm not saying that's happened, but I think they're starting to realize this is not going to be as easy as what they did to the Russian people.
[00:52:14.738 --> 00:52:17.700]  Well, no, because we're not Russian peasants, we're not Chinese peasants, we're Cambodian.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.441]  This is America.
[00:52:18.941 --> 00:52:22.404]  We have a long history of fighting back against any kind of tyrant.
[00:52:23.004 --> 00:52:25.006]  And so, you know, they got their work cut out for them.
[00:52:25.266 --> 00:52:29.889]  But they're still trying the same playbook, which is demonize, marginalize, and chill speech.
[00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:33.652]  They're threatening you with arrest because they want you to stop speaking out.
[00:52:33.972 --> 00:52:35.314]  And that's the modus operandi.
[00:52:35.334 --> 00:52:39.056]  I get emails all the time saying, I'm afraid to join Oath Keepers and I want to be on a list.
[00:52:40.177 --> 00:52:45.961]  So all this DHS stuff and the Heslopavi Law Center, it does work on some people because it shows their speech.
[00:53:10.578 --> 00:53:11.058]  That's right.
[00:53:11.158 --> 00:53:12.340]  That's why I said I'm listening to Green.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.404]  The answer is, they have 300 names on that list.
[00:53:15.444 --> 00:53:16.525]  But it's all on the list.
[00:53:16.965 --> 00:53:18.267]  And that is the proper response.
[00:53:18.327 --> 00:53:19.709]  And that's what I think is going to happen.
[00:53:20.208 --> 00:53:32.233]  So, folks, don't let them chill your speech, because if you think you're going to be able to just be quietly the gray man in the mole and sit back and not make waves and you're going to be okay, you're kidding yourself.
[00:53:32.613 --> 00:53:33.614]  Go look back at history.
[00:53:33.974 --> 00:53:35.234]  Look at the gulags in Russia.
[00:53:35.655 --> 00:53:39.236]  Half the guys in the gulags were riding Stalin, saying, I can understand why I'm here.
[00:53:39.476 --> 00:53:40.357]  There was some mistake.
[00:53:40.397 --> 00:53:41.197]  There was no mistake.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.261]  You're there for a damn good reason.
[00:53:43.381 --> 00:53:45.243]  Don't think being quiet is going to keep you safe.
[00:53:45.623 --> 00:53:47.785]  You need to step out in the street right now and speak up.
[00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:50.387]  Use your First Amendment before you have to use a second.
[00:53:51.147 --> 00:53:51.688]  Exactly.
[00:53:51.748 --> 00:53:55.170]  The only way to beat these people is to stand up to the bullies.
[00:53:55.551 --> 00:54:00.194]  And that's what Alexander Solzhenitsyn said, to paraphrase, oh how we burned in the camps.
[00:54:00.715 --> 00:54:06.860]  That when Stalin would send out his secret police arresting people every night, that we didn't wait for him with our daggers and our hatchets.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:14.528]  And literally, folks, you cross over to a point, spiritually, mentally, historically, that you're part of a species.
[00:54:14.888 --> 00:54:18.712]  And liberty and freedom for the human condition is what matters.
[00:54:18.952 --> 00:54:23.637]  And not letting control freaks and criminals and backstabbers and parasites run things.
[00:54:24.358 --> 00:54:26.540]  And I look at it this way, politically.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.101]  Not physically, but if need be.
[00:54:28.561 --> 00:54:29.162]  The Alamo.
[00:54:29.582 --> 00:54:31.083]  You know, Travis knew he was going to die.
[00:54:31.103 --> 00:54:32.084]  He said victory in death.
[00:54:32.304 --> 00:54:33.225]  He felt good about it.
[00:54:33.565 --> 00:54:35.226]  And it wasn't that he was some madman.
[00:54:35.586 --> 00:54:38.309]  This was the chance of a lifetime to stand up to a bunch of thugs.
[00:54:38.729 --> 00:54:42.592]  And he knew that his blood was going to water the tree of liberty.
[00:54:43.132 --> 00:54:45.174]  And so I don't know what people are afraid of out there.
[00:54:45.374 --> 00:54:52.041]  This is the real chance to actually fight for the Republic when it's really under attack, when they're coming for your family.
[00:54:52.101 --> 00:54:53.843]  Stewart, closing comment in the last 45 seconds.
[00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:56.852]  Hey, we're all going to die anyway, you know.
[00:54:57.112 --> 00:54:58.633]  And like I said, use your voice first.
[00:54:59.054 --> 00:55:00.135]  But hey, I'm not afraid to die.
[00:55:00.155 --> 00:55:00.876]  I'm going to die anyway.
[00:55:00.896 --> 00:55:02.257]  None of us gets out of here alive.
[00:55:02.557 --> 00:55:04.299]  And what counts is that our children are free.
[00:55:04.479 --> 00:55:05.060]  That's all that counts.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.942]  So it's time to voice.
[00:55:07.182 --> 00:55:07.722]  Use your voice.
[00:55:08.944 --> 00:55:10.185]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[00:55:10.345 --> 00:55:12.107]  Use your pen and speak out.
[00:55:12.387 --> 00:55:13.949]  And join Oath Keepers at OathKeepers.org.
[00:55:15.225 --> 00:55:19.092]  All right, Stuart, as that fundraiser comes up, we're going to get behind you and our great listeners.
[00:55:19.132 --> 00:55:20.254]  That's what is important.
[00:55:21.035 --> 00:55:22.578]  I'm just the gateway to these great people.
[00:55:23.079 --> 00:55:23.960]  He's going to support you.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:24.521]  God bless you.
[00:55:24.541 --> 00:55:25.763]  We'll talk to you as that approaches.
[00:55:27.247 --> 00:55:27.627]  Thank you.
[00:55:28.007 --> 00:55:29.048]  More of your calls straight ahead.
[00:55:29.128 --> 00:55:30.388]  Bob Chapman as well.
[00:55:30.788 --> 00:55:31.688]  A ton of news.
[00:55:32.228 --> 00:55:34.729]  We are now entering the second American revolution.
[00:55:35.309 --> 00:55:39.050]  Gerald Salente has now written an editorial concurring with my analysis.
[00:55:39.391 --> 00:55:44.552]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:55:44.692 --> 00:55:46.633]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:55:46.773 --> 00:55:49.053]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:55:49.214 --> 00:55:51.074]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:55:51.494 --> 00:55:52.855]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:55:53.115 --> 00:55:54.155]  There is a solution.
[00:55:54.375 --> 00:56:02.401]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:56:16.292 --> 00:56:21.895]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:56:22.315 --> 00:56:26.117]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[00:56:39.585 --> 00:56:44.569]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:48.573]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:56:48.813 --> 00:56:54.418]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:56:54.718 --> 00:56:59.582]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:56:59.782 --> 00:57:00.283]  Number three,
[00:57:00.683 --> 00:57:06.130]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:57:06.991 --> 00:57:09.635]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:57:09.895 --> 00:57:13.300]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:57:14.421 --> 00:57:18.026]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:57:18.246 --> 00:57:23.728]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:57:23.988 --> 00:57:28.529]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:30.230]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:32.791]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[00:57:33.011 --> 00:57:35.652]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:57:39.153 --> 00:57:40.234]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:57:40.534 --> 00:57:42.314]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:57:42.514 --> 00:57:43.175]  Well, you should.
[00:57:43.495 --> 00:57:47.757]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:57:47.997 --> 00:57:48.477]  That's right.
[00:57:48.797 --> 00:57:57.241]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:57:57.461 --> 00:57:58.701]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:57:58.801 --> 00:57:59.962]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:58:00.162 --> 00:58:05.786]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:58:06.146 --> 00:58:12.670]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:18.254]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:58:18.554 --> 00:58:19.715]  This is real.
[00:58:20.035 --> 00:58:20.755]  Don't miss out.
[00:58:21.075 --> 00:58:27.940]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.440]  And get your free handgun.

[00:58:39.643 --> 00:58:44.724]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:45.044 --> 00:58:47.384]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:58:47.404 --> 00:58:52.825]  Dean, Arizona.
[00:58:52.865 --> 00:58:53.666]  Jevin, Ohio.
[00:58:53.806 --> 00:58:55.086]  Inger, Florida.
[00:58:56.668 --> 00:58:59.711]  John in Ohio, Dave in Florida, and many others.
[00:58:59.751 --> 00:59:00.671]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:59:01.032 --> 00:59:04.254]  Wide open phones for the next hour with Bob Chapman.
[00:59:04.835 --> 00:59:08.638]  I'm going to recap some of the top stories, get into some of the other news I haven't covered yet.
[00:59:09.439 --> 00:59:10.760]  Bob, there's so much to talk about.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:15.504]  For those that don't know, Bob Chapman, of course, was in military intelligence during the Cold War in Berlin.
[00:59:16.284 --> 00:59:21.205]  Then he became one of the most successful silver and gold traders out there.
[00:59:21.225 --> 00:59:28.187]  He also helped publish some of the original Patriot publications, like Gary Allen's Don't Dare Call a Conspiracy, that woke me up.
[00:59:28.927 --> 00:59:31.448]  Really, there's one founding thing that really put it all together.
[00:59:31.508 --> 00:59:32.388]  I had the info.
[00:59:33.248 --> 00:59:34.468]  Kind of the term born awake.
[00:59:34.488 --> 00:59:37.829]  I mean, I just grew up knowing history, knowing the truth, learning it as I went.
[00:59:38.109 --> 00:59:41.170]  But that film really crystallized things when I was about 14 or 15 and read it.
[00:59:43.018 --> 00:59:48.863]  He was involved in publishing that, worked with so many other people, and of course has one of the biggest newsletters out there, The International Forecaster.
[00:59:48.883 --> 00:59:52.285]  www.TheInternationalForecaster.com, our website is www.InfoWars.com.
[00:59:52.605 --> 00:59:54.747]  But I want to move through just quick topics with you.
[00:59:55.007 --> 00:59:56.769]  Let's cover the economy first.
[00:59:58.182 --> 01:00:02.026]  They keep saying it's the end of the recession, everything's fine.
[01:00:02.046 --> 01:00:05.148]  558,000 people lost their job in the last month.
[01:00:05.288 --> 01:00:11.173]  The job losses are accelerating, the restaurants are closing, the factories, the industries.
[01:00:11.794 --> 01:00:19.240]  I wish things were getting better, but all the real indicators of Main Street, unless I'm wrong, Bob, show an implosion, but then they are taking their 27, their 23.7.
[01:00:22.637 --> 01:00:23.858]  And that's a month-old number.
[01:00:23.898 --> 01:00:26.120]  We'll get new numbers in the next month.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.101]  $23.7 trillion.
[01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:29.743]  Almost double the GDP stolen in 10 months.
[01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:35.287]  They are pumping it in, but they admit that's mainly institutional buyers of those stocks and bonds.
[01:00:35.567 --> 01:00:36.808]  They're buying up infrastructure.
[01:00:36.848 --> 01:00:37.969]  The banks aren't lending.
[01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:40.391]  The Federal Reserve's paying to not lend.
[01:00:40.891 --> 01:00:42.032]  The dollar's going down.
[01:00:42.132 --> 01:00:43.013]  Gold's going up.
[01:00:43.313 --> 01:00:46.516]  Are we going to see another run-up in commodities like we saw a year and a half ago?
[01:00:46.996 --> 01:00:51.720]  Bob Chapman, are these green shoots, or what's really happening?
[01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:53.879]  You get Poison Ivy.
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.601]  How's that for an opener?
[01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:59.802]  He went right into it.
[01:00:59.842 --> 01:01:00.802]  Thank you very much.
[01:01:02.123 --> 01:01:18.252]  But listen, if everything was so hunky-dory, why have three top officials and top people, we'll say, in economics come out and said, I think we might need another stimulus here, like I projected last January.
[01:01:18.672 --> 01:01:20.213]  I talked in terms of two trillion.
[01:01:20.868 --> 01:01:26.473]  I know even Joe Stiglitz has come out, and he's at Harvard, and he's an eminent World Bank economist.
[01:01:27.454 --> 01:01:29.355]  And he says, yeah, we need one of these.
[01:01:29.395 --> 01:01:31.317]  We've got to give Keynesianism a chance.
[01:01:31.838 --> 01:01:39.344]  What he's saying is, I don't think the first go-around was allocated properly in the right places at the right time.
[01:01:39.364 --> 01:01:44.709]  The people who got the checks, they went out and paid all their bills with them instead of spending them.
[01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:50.113]  They got a lot of, what's involved in the stimulus package is a lot of tax breaks.
[01:01:50.554 --> 01:01:52.615]  It takes too long for them to come down the pike.
[01:01:53.356 --> 01:01:57.038]  And so, he's talking in terms like others are in the administration.
[01:01:57.358 --> 01:01:58.699]  They're getting the ball rolling.
[01:01:58.739 --> 01:02:03.423]  By the end of the year, they'll be looking for that $2 trillion so that this thing doesn't go under.
[01:02:03.783 --> 01:02:09.587]  But I think the big story here that nobody has talked about, and that's usually the case
[01:02:10.014 --> 01:02:16.218]  When I start spouting off about what's going on, there's something hidden here that people don't understand.
[01:02:16.238 --> 01:02:18.680]  I'm going to make it as simple as possible.
[01:02:20.401 --> 01:02:26.705]  It was recently that the Federal Reserve, again, created $500 billion out of nothing.
[01:02:27.805 --> 01:02:37.071]  They lent that, or exchanged that, with five other major central banks and received currencies for that.
[01:02:38.232 --> 01:02:39.413]  And they received dollars.
[01:02:41.234 --> 01:02:51.422]  They use those currencies to go into the foreign exchange market to push while they sell those foreign currencies to push those currencies down so that the dollar will go up.
[01:02:52.523 --> 01:02:53.544]  That's what that's for.
[01:02:54.524 --> 01:02:55.905]  But they're doing something else.
[01:02:57.827 --> 01:03:07.395]  They are having those central banks take those dollars that they have and go into the Treasury auction market and buy U.S.
[01:03:07.895 --> 01:03:08.696]  Treasury bills
[01:03:09.545 --> 01:03:10.926]  Notes and bonds.
[01:03:11.286 --> 01:03:15.830]  So that's monetizing the debt, but they're doing it by laundering it through foreign banks.
[01:03:16.711 --> 01:03:17.251]  Exactly.
[01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:20.734]  Now, let me give you some specifics.
[01:03:20.834 --> 01:03:22.055]  I'm writing a piece on China.
[01:03:22.735 --> 01:03:25.717]  I don't know whether it'll get published this weekend, probably on Wednesday.
[01:03:26.498 --> 01:03:38.247]  And the Chinese, it looks like they've sold off about $600 billion with the dollar-denominated assets, taking their dollar-denominated assets down to $1.1
[01:03:40.010 --> 01:04:05.275]  uh... trillion dollars now they have not been buying treasuries and so there's an absence of buying of five hundred billion to a trillion dollars so we'll say seven hundred billion so if you take it both ways you've got a sale of six hundred and a non-buy of seven hundred that's one point uh...
[01:04:08.584 --> 01:04:10.965]  I lost my train of thought there.
[01:04:12.925 --> 01:04:15.126]  It's $500 and $700.
[01:04:17.106 --> 01:04:23.108]  That's $1.3 trillion that was either sold or didn't participate.
[01:04:23.688 --> 01:04:25.529]  And somebody's got to come up with that money.
[01:04:27.265 --> 01:04:30.488]  Foreign Central Banks of some kind, and they're not coming up with it.
[01:04:30.528 --> 01:04:32.309]  They're buying, but they're not buying enough.
[01:04:32.609 --> 01:04:41.496]  So the difference that they're not buying, the Fed's buying, and they're creating the money to do so through the Foreign Central Banks, and they're trying to be puddle everybody.
[01:04:41.836 --> 01:04:48.040]  And when foreigners find out what they're doing, secretly, they're gonna freak out.
[01:04:48.761 --> 01:04:49.762]  Because they're holding 64.5% of
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:59.562]  The forex exchange that they have, foreign exchange that they have, in dollars.
[01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:06.845]  So if the dollar goes down because of what the Fed's doing behind the scenes, they're going to be very unhappy about that.
[01:05:06.905 --> 01:05:23.832]  But the Fed is also, let me just interrupt here, the Fed is also, as you said, and this has been confirmed, it's also devaluing their currency so everybody's sinking so that it's not as noticeable and then all of the assets are going to the elites.
[01:05:25.698 --> 01:05:26.338]  That's correct.
[01:05:26.978 --> 01:05:35.841]  And, you know, the Chinese could be out of the dollar in a year, maybe a year and a half, dependent.
[01:05:36.581 --> 01:05:42.443]  And that's why, that's a big reason why the dollar is going to get out and test 71.18.
[01:05:42.903 --> 01:05:45.123]  It's now around 78 and a half or so.
[01:05:46.064 --> 01:05:52.566]  And I think when it tests, it may well break through to the downside.
[01:05:53.046 --> 01:05:54.186]  And the reason I say that
[01:05:54.887 --> 01:05:59.649]  Is all these other nations who have been holding on, they're going to say, hey, we've been taken.
[01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:01.930]  Now, how long that's going to take?
[01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:02.471]  I don't know.
[01:06:02.531 --> 01:06:03.531]  It could take six months.
[01:06:03.951 --> 01:06:05.372]  It could take two and a half years.
[01:06:05.852 --> 01:06:06.453]  I don't know.
[01:06:07.673 --> 01:06:18.878]  We don't know what the reaction to these governments is going to be, because don't forget that when they don't do what Washington tells them, and they're very strong about, we don't want to do that.
[01:06:19.779 --> 01:06:22.340]  Washington tells them, do you want your country invaded?
[01:06:23.194 --> 01:06:27.498]  I mean, do you want your internet and banking services cut off?
[01:06:28.078 --> 01:06:31.060]  Do you want your postal from the United States cut off?
[01:06:31.781 --> 01:06:33.783]  Your planes can't land in our country?
[01:06:33.803 --> 01:06:36.345]  And this is true, they do this.
[01:06:36.365 --> 01:06:41.789]  Because I've been told by ex-heads of state that they actually do this.
[01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:45.472]  So, this is where this is all leading.
[01:06:46.092 --> 01:06:48.955]  And the dollar going down is a lead pipe search.
[01:06:49.635 --> 01:06:51.597]  You know, the question is how bad it'll be.
[01:06:51.937 --> 01:06:53.359]  Well, Bob, that's what the world government is.
[01:06:53.399 --> 01:06:54.020]  They brag.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:07:04.053]  This new bank of the world won't just buy fiat or intimidation or arm-twisting or claiming you're a terrorist state and putting embargoes on you or sanctions.
[01:07:04.473 --> 01:07:09.100]  They are going to openly have the power to manipulate all the currencies and manipulate
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:10.201]  How is it going for them?
[01:07:10.281 --> 01:07:12.643]  Are things going well in your expert opinion?
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:45.462]  I think they're not going well for them, and that was pointed out in Greece at the Bilderberg Conference.
[01:07:46.143 --> 01:07:51.004]  And what they're trying to do, I think, is pull this thing back and stop it.
[01:07:51.465 --> 01:08:00.628]  And I think it's way beyond their ability to stop this destruction, economically and financially, of not only the United States, but the world.
[01:08:01.068 --> 01:08:04.729]  And I really think that that's what they're trying to do in here, and that's what I think they agreed on.
[01:08:05.229 --> 01:08:06.470]  And I don't think it's possible.
[01:08:07.905 --> 01:08:10.007]  It would be good actually if it was possible.
[01:08:10.467 --> 01:08:19.194]  But you know, June of 2002 was the date when you had flown too far and you couldn't go back.
[01:08:20.075 --> 01:08:21.496]  The point of no return.
[01:08:22.377 --> 01:08:23.678]  And they're going to have to live with it.
[01:08:24.198 --> 01:08:26.620]  And if it doesn't work out for them,
[01:08:28.663 --> 01:08:32.244]  What's going to happen is the public is going to say, all right, who did this to us?
[01:08:32.264 --> 01:08:39.186]  They're going to line them up in court, and they're going to put them in jail, and they're going to take their wealth away from them, if they're lucky.
[01:08:40.186 --> 01:08:45.568]  If we have a repeat of the French Revolution, I don't think it's going to be very nice.
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:59.487]  But Bob, the problem is the establishment, and I'm sure that now with the Southern Poverty Law Center's declaration demonizing any gun owners or anybody that doesn't want world government, the feds are going to stage terror attacks against themselves.
[01:09:00.247 --> 01:09:02.949]  We even have congressmen coming out saying they're going to stage something.
[01:09:02.969 --> 01:09:05.310]  They may use flu for martial law.
[01:09:05.610 --> 01:09:08.312]  Congressman Brown is in the Louisville Journal.
[01:09:08.872 --> 01:09:10.833]  This is all very clear.
[01:09:11.213 --> 01:09:12.154]  Their only move
[01:09:12.794 --> 01:09:21.569]  is to play the victim and they always do that with a Reichstag event and I agree that people are so angry and so awake that that's probably gonna blow up
[01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:28.173]  And, but I don't see the hubris-filled establishment backing off.
[01:09:28.914 --> 01:09:32.497]  So, I see this playing out with a lot of fireworks.
[01:09:32.537 --> 01:09:43.885]  And I agree with you, the evidence of Geithner chewing the carpet, blowing up, screaming at Bernanke, other evidence coming out, shows that all is not well in Camelot, and that
[01:09:45.299 --> 01:09:48.561]  The pit they dug for us is going to enfold them.
[01:09:48.601 --> 01:10:04.009]  And lastly, it's clear, and now they're even starting to admit this, that they're creating a depression on Main Street as they pump out all these fiat dollars to pay off their derivatives debts, and that they're paying banks not to loan, because if the banks did loan, we'd have inflation.
[01:10:04.469 --> 01:10:13.111]  So instead, you literally have the elite being able to buy everything up, we pay the interest on giving them the money, and then we get to live in a depression.
[01:10:13.471 --> 01:10:14.852]  So I want your take on that when we get back.
[01:10:14.872 --> 01:10:16.012]  We're going to phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:10:16.052 --> 01:10:18.513]  Pentagon wants authority to post 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[01:10:19.053 --> 01:10:20.253]  This is official, congressional report.
[01:10:27.878 --> 01:10:28.958]  That's just off the chart.
[01:10:29.138 --> 01:10:32.919]  And that the troops are training for martial law drills, mainstream news.
[01:10:33.239 --> 01:10:34.339]  We're going to go over that too.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.080]  Big hour and 40 minutes left.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.080]  Stay with us.

[01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:45.617]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:11:46.318 --> 01:11:51.659]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:11:52.199 --> 01:11:58.361]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:11:58.701 --> 01:12:00.522]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:12:00.662 --> 01:12:03.044]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:12:03.144 --> 01:12:14.070]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:12:16.311 --> 01:12:17.592]  It's not about left or right.
[01:12:17.992 --> 01:12:19.393]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:12:19.853 --> 01:12:26.077]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:12:39.559 --> 01:12:43.222]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.

[01:13:48.595 --> 01:13:48.975]  I don't know.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.341]  We're good to go.
[01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:43.371]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:50.233]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:15:00.036 --> 01:15:06.158]  Bob, I catch myself pinching myself like I'm in a dream.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:14.505]  To have mainstream news reporting, they're doing martial law drills, how to lock down cities, how to forcibly inoculate people.
[01:15:14.965 --> 01:15:19.949]  The Pentagon now wants 400,000 to deal with emergencies, terrorism, and insurrection.
[01:15:19.969 --> 01:15:25.574]  I mean, there's no doubt they're going to completely turn into a total Red Dawn armed camp with checkpoints.
[01:15:25.634 --> 01:15:27.335]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[01:15:27.355 --> 01:15:29.097]  The government is totally rogue and criminal.
[01:15:29.117 --> 01:15:30.638]  It doesn't matter what administration.
[01:15:32.051 --> 01:15:43.994]  But Governor's Association, according to the Hill newspaper, have sent a letter to them saying this is a takeover, we're concerned, your federal power grab, you know, the Pentagon doing this.
[01:15:45.495 --> 01:16:00.379]  We've got Congressman Brown telling the Louisville newspaper that they may want to use, and that quote, the elite want to use, the flu pandemic, they may stage it as a pretext for martial law.
[01:16:00.799 --> 01:16:01.039]  I mean,
[01:16:02.463 --> 01:16:07.785]  Bob Chapman, it's... The stuff we were talking about years ago is now becoming mainstream.
[01:16:08.525 --> 01:16:16.928]  I'd say our movement is 50 times bigger, conservatively, than it was in the mid-1990s when the feds bombed themselves to play the part of victims.
[01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:23.871]  I don't see an Oklahoma City or something, or even a staged mass shooting they staged to blame us.
[01:16:24.411 --> 01:16:25.492]  I don't see that working.
[01:16:25.772 --> 01:16:27.772]  We've done our job exposing the globalists.
[01:16:29.033 --> 01:16:31.254]  I mean, we've still got a long way to go here, but I think
[01:16:32.154 --> 01:16:34.736]  We have irrevocably damaged the New World Order.
[01:16:38.178 --> 01:16:38.919]  And I agree.
[01:16:39.239 --> 01:16:41.921]  And we've talked about this in the past several weeks.
[01:16:42.862 --> 01:16:50.107]  And the internet and the broadcasting that we've been able to get out has forced their hand.
[01:16:51.088 --> 01:16:57.713]  And they're going to have to try to go for it here because what they're doing financially and economically is blowing up on them.
[01:16:58.673 --> 01:17:00.855]  I figure that by the Chinese
[01:17:02.049 --> 01:17:03.729]  Selling U.S.
[01:17:03.769 --> 01:17:07.610]  dollar-denominated assets and not buying U.S.
[01:17:07.670 --> 01:17:28.935]  denominated assets has had to have made the Fed, secretly, this year, purchase somewhere between $500 billion and $800 billion worth of Treasury and GSE paper, which is Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie, and that's what they're up to.
[01:17:29.346 --> 01:17:32.867]  Well, no, they admitted to Congress they bought it, but they wouldn't say how much.
[01:17:33.987 --> 01:17:37.548]  No, that was another program that was announced.
[01:17:37.668 --> 01:17:40.209]  That program there, this is beside that program.
[01:17:40.829 --> 01:17:47.491]  That program there was $300 billion in Treasuries, $600 billion in GSEs, and $1.2 trillion in CDOs.
[01:17:51.662 --> 01:17:57.346]  Yeah, and then I saw Bernanke at a town hall meeting say he's not monetizing.
[01:17:57.406 --> 01:18:01.649]  I mean, that's like him coming on TV and saying dollars aren't green.
[01:18:04.131 --> 01:18:04.791]  They all lie.
[01:18:05.312 --> 01:18:12.457]  It's part of the sociopathic and psychopathic mind trail of what we're dealing with here.
[01:18:12.977 --> 01:18:16.400]  I mean, we're dealing with a bunch of Caligulas, hundreds of them.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.402]  I mean, these people are really insane.
[01:18:21.994 --> 01:18:27.418]  What do you think about the fact that they first demonized three weeks ago, and I told you it was going to be big news, folks.
[01:18:27.918 --> 01:18:28.799]  I can see these trends.
[01:18:31.241 --> 01:18:33.983]  And I make that point so people pay attention to what we're saying here.
[01:18:34.023 --> 01:18:35.003]  We know what we're talking about.
[01:18:35.924 --> 01:18:37.165]  First they said it was all fake.
[01:18:37.285 --> 01:18:40.147]  Now they've had to apologize and say, OK, it wasn't fake.
[01:18:40.427 --> 01:18:42.989]  So see how they arrogantly tried to say it was fake?
[01:18:43.009 --> 01:18:46.672]  And I said two weeks ago, Bob said two weeks ago, that was going to blow up only bigger.
[01:18:47.032 --> 01:18:49.014]  Now they've done the smart thing and apologized.
[01:18:49.334 --> 01:18:50.655]  But too little too late, Bob.
[01:18:52.642 --> 01:18:55.083]  Yeah, we just got to continue the steamroller.
[01:18:55.604 --> 01:19:08.491]  People have got to continue to be outspoken, like you saw at the town hall meetings, like at the tea parties, the promulgation of a movement by Ron Paul.
[01:19:09.192 --> 01:19:10.713]  It's got to get bigger and better.
[01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:12.734]  We have to drive them crazy.
[01:19:12.774 --> 01:19:14.315]  We have to get in their face.
[01:19:15.115 --> 01:19:19.418]  And if we don't do that, we may end up fighting in the streets.
[01:19:20.138 --> 01:19:21.359]  And so we've got to do it.
[01:19:21.874 --> 01:19:24.456]  We've got to show them that we're not going to back down.
[01:19:25.256 --> 01:19:27.457]  We've got to show them how powerful we can be.
[01:19:28.318 --> 01:19:31.920]  And we have to tell the military, you're our guys.
[01:19:32.921 --> 01:19:34.322]  We want to be with you.
[01:19:35.262 --> 01:19:37.904]  We don't want to be against you.
[01:19:38.604 --> 01:19:40.245]  And so get it together.
[01:19:40.265 --> 01:19:43.207]  The government is giving you unlawful orders.
[01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:45.869]  And that's exactly what that is.
[01:19:45.969 --> 01:19:48.350]  It's in violation of posse capitatis.
[01:19:48.811 --> 01:19:49.411]  And they know it.
[01:19:50.714 --> 01:19:52.175]  The military people know it.
[01:19:55.476 --> 01:19:56.616]  Well, they certainly do.
[01:19:56.636 --> 01:20:02.959]  I mean, a year and a half ago, 70 plus percent of the campaign donations were to Ron Paul from the military.
[01:20:03.939 --> 01:20:07.521]  But I guess that's why they're trying to get rid of all the citizens and hire felons and illegal aliens.
[01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:10.023]  Alright, we're going to go right to your phone calls.
[01:20:10.083 --> 01:20:13.344]  D-Jeff, Inger, John, Dave, and others.
[01:20:13.364 --> 01:20:13.625]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:20:13.665 --> 01:20:17.327]  Add your question and comment.
[01:20:17.367 --> 01:20:17.607]  Ready?
[01:20:17.947 --> 01:20:18.828]  We'll go right to you.
[01:20:19.448 --> 01:20:20.489]  On the other side of this break.
[01:20:20.589 --> 01:20:24.471]  And then, we're scheduled to have Ambassador Alan Keyes on.
[01:20:24.991 --> 01:20:26.112]  On a host of issues.
[01:20:26.552 --> 01:20:27.613]  In the final hour.
[01:20:27.873 --> 01:20:28.353]  Today.
[01:20:30.254 --> 01:20:31.155]  We're on the march.
[01:20:31.655 --> 01:20:33.156]  The empire's on the run.
[01:20:34.151 --> 01:20:37.012]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:40.072 --> 01:20:42.673]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:20:43.093 --> 01:20:48.054]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:20:48.414 --> 01:20:50.155]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:20:50.455 --> 01:20:55.276]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:20:55.456 --> 01:20:56.396]  How much do you want?
[01:20:56.636 --> 01:20:57.377]  When do you want it?
[01:20:57.757 --> 01:20:59.358]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:20:59.638 --> 01:21:00.478]  When will you need it?
[01:21:00.719 --> 01:21:02.780]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.021]  Will there be any food?
[01:21:04.261 --> 01:21:05.602]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:21:05.782 --> 01:21:10.865]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:21:11.065 --> 01:21:14.247]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:21:14.648 --> 01:21:18.110]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:19.431]  How much will you need?
[01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:20.292]  We don't know.
[01:21:20.572 --> 01:21:21.492]  How much do you want?
[01:21:21.693 --> 01:21:22.433]  All you can get.
[01:21:22.613 --> 01:21:23.474]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:21:23.714 --> 01:21:26.476]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:21:26.757 --> 01:21:28.518]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:21:28.538 --> 01:21:29.459]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:21:39.011 --> 01:21:44.198]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:21:44.338 --> 01:21:48.684]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:21:48.864 --> 01:21:50.707]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:21:51.127 --> 01:21:52.489]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:21:52.749 --> 01:21:53.791]  There is a solution.
[01:21:54.011 --> 01:22:02.033]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:22:02.433 --> 01:22:09.494]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:22:15.936 --> 01:22:21.517]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:25.761]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:22:26.101 --> 01:22:32.268]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.

[01:22:38.968 --> 01:22:42.929]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:44.970]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:53.473]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:22:53.733 --> 01:22:58.934]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:00.895]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:23:01.135 --> 01:23:07.438]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:23:07.638 --> 01:23:18.383]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:23:18.703 --> 01:23:19.163]  That's right.
[01:23:19.463 --> 01:23:21.764]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:23:22.024 --> 01:23:23.764]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:23:23.804 --> 01:23:24.044]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:23:24.104 --> 01:23:26.465]  Or visit A Cola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:23:26.665 --> 01:23:27.245]  That's acolablue.com.
[01:23:47.402 --> 01:23:47.662]  I think.
[01:24:11.525 --> 01:24:18.208]  We are going to your phone calls and a host of other news items here in just a minute or two.
[01:24:18.948 --> 01:24:31.674]  I wanted to first tell all the radio listeners and PrisonPlanet.TV viewers watching us right now, as we simulcast the radio show as a television show, that we have all the Obama shirts in.
[01:24:31.694 --> 01:24:35.036]  Eight different varieties of Obama with the iconic
[01:24:36.992 --> 01:24:42.936]  Joker Paint as the psychopathic criminal that he is for the New World Order, lying about everything.
[01:24:43.417 --> 01:24:44.998]  Everything he says is a complete lie.
[01:24:45.638 --> 01:24:47.379]  Even worse than Bush when it comes to lying.
[01:24:47.719 --> 01:24:49.761]  Bush actually did a few of the things he said he would do.
[01:24:51.462 --> 01:24:53.544]  It was just what he was doing was unconstitutional.
[01:24:55.405 --> 01:24:57.326]  These are all available at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:57.426 --> 01:25:00.028]  You can also print off the free flyers.
[01:25:00.608 --> 01:25:03.711]  And I would suggest you put them in legal, lawful places.
[01:25:04.585 --> 01:25:09.627]  That's wherever you see a bunch of other posters an inch thick in your city center or wherever.
[01:25:10.328 --> 01:25:13.129]  If they come after you for that, that's selective enforcement.
[01:25:13.169 --> 01:25:13.789]  They're thugs.
[01:25:14.529 --> 01:25:17.211]  And they're trying to intimidate everybody and say you better not do it.
[01:25:17.251 --> 01:25:18.271]  That's because they're scared of it.
[01:25:20.972 --> 01:25:28.956]  Meanwhile, the President tells his supporters, the Washington Post, we have that linked up on InfoWars.com, to go out and put his image everywhere.
[01:25:29.156 --> 01:25:33.898]  The iconic Hope image, where he's like mousy tongue or linen.
[01:25:35.276 --> 01:25:48.126]  looking off into the distance thinking about the property he's gonna steal from people uh... so that is available again at info wars dot com you can get the t-shirts or call toll free 888-253-3139 we also have films like the obama
[01:25:54.676 --> 01:26:01.066]  Deception, available in-game, Terror Storm, all the other great books and videos we carry at InfoWars.com.
[01:26:01.106 --> 01:26:03.209]  You can also call toll-free to get them, 888-253-3139.
[01:26:08.104 --> 01:26:11.405]  And I think a few of the sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[01:26:11.645 --> 01:26:15.606]  The best storable foods company in the nation also has the best prices I've found.
[01:26:16.146 --> 01:26:18.607]  The food is packed every day, every week.
[01:26:18.847 --> 01:26:19.747]  None of it is old.
[01:26:20.167 --> 01:26:24.228]  Most of the other companies, because I bought from two or three others, I guess more than two, it's embarrassing.
[01:26:24.668 --> 01:26:30.010]  It was ancient 5, 10, 15-year-old crap or C-rations from Vietnam.
[01:26:30.730 --> 01:26:35.551]  This is brand new, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[01:26:38.277 --> 01:26:40.099]  And it's high quality right here in America.
[01:26:40.179 --> 01:26:42.982]  Only thing not grown here is the tropical bananas.
[01:26:43.302 --> 01:26:45.365]  But those are non-GMO.
[01:26:45.665 --> 01:26:49.649]  So, efoodsdirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[01:26:50.029 --> 01:26:52.152]  In this crazy world, folks, you need storable foods.
[01:26:52.192 --> 01:26:54.334]  This is 55% off grocery store prices.
[01:26:54.674 --> 01:26:58.659]  Check out the free videos online at efoodsdirect.com or big...
[01:26:59.139 --> 01:27:01.362]  Banners up on InfoWars.com if you forget.
[01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:03.925]  The web address and the toll free number is 800-409-5633.
[01:27:03.945 --> 01:27:05.987]  You can call and get a free brochure.
[01:27:06.007 --> 01:27:06.047]  800-409-5633.
[01:27:10.197 --> 01:27:10.638]  I don't know.
[01:27:31.553 --> 01:27:34.416]  DigiNet Personal Audio Video Recorders.
[01:27:34.476 --> 01:27:37.800]  The website is D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:44.346]  Now, I, just last year, bought the very same digital video audio recorder pen they have for like $150.
[01:27:44.767 --> 01:27:48.351]  To sneak into the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[01:27:49.652 --> 01:27:53.096]  And, it's a great pen, but I paid three times as much.
[01:27:54.272 --> 01:27:55.793]  They are a huge bulk seller.
[01:27:56.173 --> 01:27:57.154]  One of the leaders out there.
[01:27:57.194 --> 01:27:57.714]  That's how they do it.
[01:27:57.734 --> 01:27:58.755]  They got a bunch of other systems.
[01:27:59.035 --> 01:28:10.423]  Little hidden cameras that go in your car that are very reliable and wire into just a memory card hidden in the car where you hit one button and you can record the police when they pull you over or anybody else for that matter.
[01:28:10.523 --> 01:28:13.945]  Very, very useful to protect yourself and admissible in court.
[01:28:14.525 --> 01:28:15.626]  Diginet.net.
[01:28:15.686 --> 01:28:16.847]  Fight fire with fire.
[01:28:17.247 --> 01:28:18.768]  Use Big Brother against Big Brother.
[01:28:18.868 --> 01:28:19.369]  Diginet.net.
[01:28:21.670 --> 01:28:23.511]  G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:28:23.771 --> 01:28:24.531]  Diginet dot net.
[01:28:24.551 --> 01:28:26.872]  I want to thank those sponsors for making the show possible.
[01:28:27.152 --> 01:28:29.532]  Be sure and support our local sponsors.
[01:28:29.973 --> 01:28:33.654]  AM and FM stations and others that carry the show, support them as well.
[01:28:33.714 --> 01:28:34.894]  They make it all possible.
[01:28:35.174 --> 01:28:36.375]  Without them we wouldn't be here.
[01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:40.416]  Okay, coming up when I start the next hour, we've got Ambassador
[01:28:42.972 --> 01:28:43.332]  I sure am.
[01:29:03.283 --> 01:29:04.384]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:29:04.424 --> 01:29:06.145]  This is Deetra and Tempe.
[01:29:06.725 --> 01:29:08.367]  I have a question for you two gentlemen.
[01:29:08.527 --> 01:29:10.208]  But first I wanted to thank you.
[01:29:10.228 --> 01:29:13.090]  You guys are doing a great job getting all the information out.
[01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:15.852]  I wish more people would wake up.
[01:29:15.932 --> 01:29:20.215]  It's frustrating to see people around you just walking around in a daze, you know.
[01:29:21.275 --> 01:29:22.016]  My question is,
[01:29:22.777 --> 01:29:32.901]  I understand that we're supposed to be the people and they're supposed to take our votes and get our opinions and things like that and obviously that's not happening.
[01:29:32.921 --> 01:29:34.742]  You don't have to be a genius to see that.
[01:29:35.652 --> 01:29:46.820]  What happened to, like, making citizens arrest, and impeaching people from Congress, and actually, you know, getting them out of office and getting people in there who can do something?
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:51.583]  Alright, let me comment on that, Dee, and then we'll get your comeback after Bob comments.
[01:29:52.203 --> 01:29:53.624]  Briefly, this is a whole issue.
[01:29:54.705 --> 01:30:00.949]  The states are constituted by the people, so under state law, they can create incorporated cities and counties.
[01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.870]  The people.
[01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:04.392]  You can go out in the middle of nowhere and start your own city.
[01:30:05.236 --> 01:30:06.377]  And then you can hire cops.
[01:30:07.098 --> 01:30:08.619]  And then they can go out and give people tickets.
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.983]  But if you do something outside of the law, you get the book thrown at you.
[01:30:13.644 --> 01:30:18.588]  Instead, the government breaks the law and doesn't get in trouble because they're engaging in corruption.
[01:30:19.249 --> 01:30:24.134]  Citizens arrest was a lot of towns, even towns that might have had a couple thousand people in them.
[01:30:24.949 --> 01:30:28.992]  Would have one sheriff, maybe two deputies for a thousand or more people.
[01:30:29.553 --> 01:30:43.724]  But then, the sheriff had auxiliary deputies, upstanding members of the community, who weren't corrupt, who, if they saw a problem, they would do something, or even if you weren't, if you saw somebody robbing, you'd go over and conk them on the head if they resisted, and citizens arrest!
[01:30:44.324 --> 01:30:50.009]  But the government demonizes that, because they want a monopoly of power and force.
[01:30:50.874 --> 01:30:58.410]  And so that's why in England, where the citizen's arrest started, under the common law of Magna Carta, they try to demonize people defending...
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:29.752]  you know their rights and if you even punch somebody robbing your house they arrest you uh... so they have slowly taught us that we don't have rights that's why it's important people wear guns in open because and have demonstrations doing that showing people we still have a second amendment because people think guns are illegal in your house now because the TV told them it's all lies people think it's the law you gotta take vaccines we're showing the world it's not the law we're exposing the hoax
[01:31:30.552 --> 01:31:31.453]  The mind trick.
[01:31:31.513 --> 01:31:32.173]  Bob Chapman.
[01:31:34.495 --> 01:31:37.897]  Alex, I can't add much to that because you've covered it all.
[01:31:37.937 --> 01:31:48.505]  I think the bottom line is it's very difficult to try to use citizen's arrest today and you could get yourself in trouble by doing so because of the distortion of law.
[01:31:51.414 --> 01:31:52.896]  Well, who can do something?
[01:31:52.916 --> 01:31:57.842]  I mean, just like, I don't know, maybe you guys remember back, uh, I think it was in 2007.
[01:31:58.403 --> 01:32:03.869]  Cynthia McKinney was going through the records and, you know, mentioned that there was, what, $3 trillion missing?
[01:32:04.410 --> 01:32:07.073]  And then it just stopped, you know, and that's what happens.
[01:32:07.113 --> 01:32:07.314]  I mean,
[01:32:07.814 --> 01:32:12.017]  People say something, and then they object, and then that's the end of it.
[01:32:12.097 --> 01:32:13.858]  And then we move on to the next thing to object.
[01:32:14.019 --> 01:32:14.659]  Exactly.
[01:32:14.759 --> 01:32:17.301]  That's what tyrants and thugs do.
[01:32:17.401 --> 01:32:20.543]  Once they've trained you to accept corruption, the sky's the limit.
[01:32:20.583 --> 01:32:21.164]  Thank you, Dee.
[01:32:21.704 --> 01:32:25.166]  It was $2 trillion when Bush got into office.
[01:32:25.246 --> 01:32:27.368]  It was over $5 trillion by the time he left.
[01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:31.971]  The Pentagon gets up before Congress and says, we're not telling you where the money is.
[01:32:32.291 --> 01:32:34.433]  And they literally laugh at Congress.
[01:32:34.473 --> 01:32:36.154]  Folks, that's why they've stolen $23.7 trillion.
[01:32:37.967 --> 01:32:38.728]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:32:38.788 --> 01:32:41.630]  And they're going to keep right on doing it as long as they can do it.
[01:33:03.356 --> 01:33:03.956]  Absolutely.
[01:33:04.016 --> 01:33:04.436]  Thank you, Dee.
[01:33:04.496 --> 01:33:08.758]  Jeff in Ohio, you're on the air with a fellow that heads up the internationalforecaster.com.
[01:33:08.778 --> 01:33:09.078]  Go ahead.
[01:33:31.886 --> 01:33:33.566]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[01:33:34.046 --> 01:33:56.490]  Yeah, I heard you mention earlier in the program, uh, Gary Allen, and I'm curious, though, about, uh, you know, with, uh, you know, and I appreciate what you're doing, you know, trying to expose, you know, the global elites and all that, but have you ever read, uh, Conspiracy, a Biblical View by Dr. Gary North?
[01:33:58.631 --> 01:34:01.011]  I don't believe so, but I've, I've, I've heard of it.
[01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:30.082]  Have you ever, well, yeah, Gary North, he is based in Texas, I believe, but it basically, his premise, and I tend to agree, is that, and this is where I'm concerned and frustrated, is that we try, we've been trying for years to try to expose the elites, yet the thing is,
[01:34:31.112 --> 01:34:39.958]  I'm kind of wondering if Gary North hit it on the head, because he contends that exposure is not enough.
[01:34:40.759 --> 01:34:48.684]  We tend to think that if everybody just knew about these global elites, they'd do the right thing.
[01:34:49.765 --> 01:34:53.608]  He contends, though, that no, that's not necessarily the case.
[01:34:54.434 --> 01:35:00.420]  The thing is, I also remember Edmund Burke says, people get the leadership they deserve.
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:05.244]  Alright, listen, Jeff, you make a good point.
[01:35:05.604 --> 01:35:08.107]  Let's get a comment from Bob Chapman and then you can follow up.
[01:35:08.147 --> 01:35:08.607]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:35:09.668 --> 01:35:13.351]  Well, what is the solution that Mr. North gives us?
[01:35:14.633 --> 01:35:17.175]  Well, he says basically to start
[01:35:18.259 --> 01:35:25.207]  Uh, working from the ground up, from the bottom up, and basically follow biblical ethics.
[01:35:25.548 --> 01:35:28.632]  Well, that's exactly what we do, and we have guest after guest after guest.
[01:35:28.652 --> 01:35:29.012]  That's right.
[01:35:29.032 --> 01:35:30.374]  That's what I've been doing for 50 years.
[01:35:30.835 --> 01:35:31.816]  And, gee, Edward Griffin.
[01:35:31.836 --> 01:35:34.600]  And, incidentally, I've known Gary Nutz for 30 years.
[01:35:35.401 --> 01:35:36.182]  I know him quite well.
[01:35:36.650 --> 01:35:44.297]  Well, I mean, let's just be clear, and I don't think you're criticizing and implying we're doing this, but we kind of ruffle our feathers and take umbrage.
[01:35:45.118 --> 01:35:51.404]  I have Jeh Eber-Griffin on over and over again about the long view of history, his Freedom Force International.
[01:35:51.944 --> 01:35:53.786]  I believe going for a long view
[01:35:54.907 --> 01:35:57.970]  Shock, short view, and the middle view.
[01:35:58.051 --> 01:35:59.512]  I say attack on all fronts.
[01:36:00.093 --> 01:36:05.418]  I believe action and motivation and throwing yourself against the gears of the globalists.
[01:36:05.859 --> 01:36:07.520]  You have to first expose it.
[01:36:07.961 --> 01:36:10.303]  So we're simultaneously doing that and now having...
[01:36:11.064 --> 01:36:16.327]  They've gone from saying ten years ago the CFR didn't exist and Rothschilds didn't exist.
[01:36:16.768 --> 01:36:21.071]  There are hundreds of news articles, Bob you remember all this, saying it doesn't exist.
[01:36:21.171 --> 01:36:23.952]  Now they say, oh it exists, but we need a world government.
[01:36:24.313 --> 01:36:26.354]  And so people are saying, no we don't want that.
[01:36:26.414 --> 01:36:31.257]  See if we just try to have solutions at the grassroots, no one knows what we're talking about.
[01:36:31.497 --> 01:36:32.978]  We have to teach them the language.
[01:36:32.998 --> 01:36:34.259]  It's like we have a different language.
[01:36:34.539 --> 01:36:36.881]  They've forgotten our language of liberty and freedom and history.
[01:36:37.381 --> 01:36:50.093]  So we're like trying to teach Helen Keller how to first understand this so we can then teach her how to how to write and read and you know with braille and all this other stuff so it's a multi what I see is way too many people though
[01:36:51.252 --> 01:36:57.334]  Spending their time critiquing everyone else about the good job they need to do, when how about we just whoop some butt here?
[01:36:57.374 --> 01:36:59.255]  How about we just get in a fight?
[01:36:59.275 --> 01:37:05.337]  Because I don't have time to sit here and quarterback everybody else, and I'm not saying you're bad or Gary's bad or any of this is bad.
[01:37:05.817 --> 01:37:08.638]  My whole issue is, all I talk about is solutions.
[01:37:08.958 --> 01:37:11.459]  Reach out to the military and police to follow their oath.
[01:37:11.719 --> 01:37:12.479]  Huge solution.
[01:37:12.819 --> 01:37:19.104]  Put up posters everywhere exposing Obama as a fraud and the New World Order and giving them a website to go to.
[01:37:19.464 --> 01:37:22.206]  It gets people out, gets them active, gives them a sense of hope.
[01:37:22.846 --> 01:37:23.827]  Go to the town halls.
[01:37:23.887 --> 01:37:25.068]  How many years have I said that?
[01:37:25.328 --> 01:37:26.549]  Take over all their events.
[01:37:26.849 --> 01:37:28.270]  Don't let them have the illusion.
[01:37:28.511 --> 01:37:32.414]  I mean, I'm the guy 14 years ago going and getting arrested at town halls.
[01:37:32.854 --> 01:37:35.356]  This is, this is, it's happening, it's happening, it's happening.
[01:37:35.976 --> 01:37:38.558]  And taking over the counties, taking over the cities.
[01:37:38.598 --> 01:37:41.820]  I was just telling the last caller that we created the towns and cities.
[01:37:42.101 --> 01:37:43.141]  We've got to take them over.
[01:37:43.401 --> 01:37:47.925]  I always say don't focus on the national election, focus on the local election.
[01:37:48.585 --> 01:37:50.847]  That the national election overall is a diversion.
[01:37:51.167 --> 01:37:52.128]  Except for issues.
[01:37:52.369 --> 01:37:58.396]  That's why Ron Paul must run in 2012, because even if he has no chance of winning, he's there to inject real issues.
[01:37:58.797 --> 01:38:00.238]  Resistance is victory!
[01:38:00.479 --> 01:38:01.860]  Resistance is victory!
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:07.567]  The will to stand up and go, you may kick my butt, but I'm gonna fight you as hard as I can!
[01:38:08.308 --> 01:38:10.709]  It's that spirit that cannot be defeated!
[01:38:11.089 --> 01:38:19.714]  And so, I just get mad when I hear it in any way implied that, oh well, you know, this person says this, or, you know, the government we deserve.
[01:38:19.794 --> 01:38:21.334]  Yes, we're getting the government we deserve.
[01:38:21.555 --> 01:38:23.956]  That's why we're saying we're sorry we've been corrupt, God.
[01:38:24.196 --> 01:38:26.677]  We're going to get up off our big fat butts and do something.
[01:38:27.177 --> 01:38:28.138]  Anything else, Jeff?
[01:38:29.238 --> 01:38:32.340]  Yeah, you also mentioned about the language of freedom.
[01:38:32.833 --> 01:38:40.034]  You know, that reminds me of in George Orwell's 1984, you know, they basically destroy words.
[01:38:41.543 --> 01:38:48.707]  And, uh, you know, bend and twist and distort the language so people can't even conceive of the notion of liberty.
[01:38:49.007 --> 01:38:49.747]  Excellent point.
[01:38:50.067 --> 01:38:56.690]  Now they're telling the public to say socialism or say a bad word about government means you want to kill black people.
[01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:57.611]  It's racist.
[01:38:57.951 --> 01:39:04.414]  And some of the public actually believes it now and is calling for my death and saying, you're not allowed to talk bad.
[01:39:04.534 --> 01:39:05.355]  And so I agree.
[01:39:05.615 --> 01:39:08.556]  So we go out and educate them to the hoax.
[01:39:08.576 --> 01:39:09.317]  Appreciate the call.
[01:39:09.357 --> 01:39:09.837]  Bob Chapman.
[01:39:11.974 --> 01:39:18.917]  I agree, but I think we have to look at, everybody has a different or somewhat different approach to this.
[01:39:19.737 --> 01:39:22.798]  And you're fighting on all fronts, and I am too.
[01:39:23.818 --> 01:39:24.639]  Other people aren't.
[01:39:25.179 --> 01:39:31.701]  And they can do what they can, and we applaud them for what they're doing, but we're going to do it our way.
[01:39:33.142 --> 01:39:33.682]  Exactly.
[01:39:33.702 --> 01:39:35.903]  I mean, I never tell people how they should do something.
[01:39:36.630 --> 01:39:36.972]  Okay?
[01:39:37.594 --> 01:39:42.913]  And because, I mean, I found in my life, if I start trying, we got too many people trying to be managers here.
[01:39:43.877 --> 01:39:49.899]  Okay, all I'm saying is, folks, you're smart, you know what to do, you know you're good, you know you're not a New World Order shell.
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:56.402]  The last thing the New World Order would tell you to do would be to take action peacefully and believe in yourself and get involved.
[01:39:56.602 --> 01:39:57.622]  People always say, I'm a Fed.
[01:39:57.863 --> 01:39:59.343]  No, no, the Feds would never say that.
[01:39:59.623 --> 01:40:00.784]  That's 180 degrees.
[01:40:00.864 --> 01:40:01.704]  You know you're good.
[01:40:02.084 --> 01:40:03.445]  Let's just decide I'm bad.
[01:40:03.945 --> 01:40:04.985]  Just so the debate's over.
[01:40:05.045 --> 01:40:05.726]  Don't defend me.
[01:40:06.146 --> 01:40:07.126]  Leave Alex in the dust.
[01:40:07.266 --> 01:40:08.547]  I wanted to defeat the New World Order.
[01:40:09.167 --> 01:40:11.249]  Go out then and wake people up.
[01:40:11.409 --> 01:40:11.929]  Warn them.
[01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:13.210]  Get involved.
[01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:14.391]  You know that's real.
[01:40:14.451 --> 01:40:17.254]  You know you're good, so there's no excuse.
[01:40:17.514 --> 01:40:19.496]  People say, well, they've got better ideas for posters.
[01:40:19.836 --> 01:40:21.297]  Start a poster contest!
[01:40:21.978 --> 01:40:23.559]  I mean, that's what this is all about, folks.
[01:40:23.939 --> 01:40:24.920]  Let's take another call here.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.661]  Inger, in Florida.
[01:40:26.822 --> 01:40:27.342]  You're on the air.
[01:40:28.463 --> 01:40:28.983]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:29.584]  Hi, Bob.
[01:40:29.944 --> 01:40:30.845]  First-time caller.
[01:40:30.865 --> 01:40:35.869]  Thank you so much for taking my call and for the awesome job you guys are doing waking up everybody.
[01:40:35.889 --> 01:40:36.730]  Thank you for calling.
[01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:37.671]  Thank you for calling.
[01:40:37.691 --> 01:40:37.931]  Go ahead.
[01:40:39.356 --> 01:40:47.998]  There's been a lot going on in Southwest Florida, and I know this isn't probably relative to what you've been talking about just now, but... It's all relative, go ahead.
[01:40:48.478 --> 01:41:01.161]  For the last few weeks, there's been hundreds of trucks coming out of the limestone quarry, carrying limestone, and when I say hundreds, hundreds of trucks.
[01:41:01.201 --> 01:41:05.662]  There are Glover trucks, there are Yellow trucks, they have the black tarp on the top to hold the stuff in.
[01:41:06.368 --> 01:41:13.175]  I was just online on the Who website and that basically, they use Lime for the mass graves.
[01:41:13.275 --> 01:41:14.576]  It's in the Who document.
[01:41:14.996 --> 01:41:16.958]  Oh no, they admit they're preparing mass graves.
[01:41:17.139 --> 01:41:18.180]  I don't know about anecdotal.
[01:41:19.289 --> 01:41:22.332]  evidence of limestone trucks.
[01:41:22.652 --> 01:41:23.073]  Stay there!
[01:41:23.673 --> 01:41:24.334]  Stay there, ma'am.
[01:41:24.494 --> 01:41:26.476]  Destruction is kicking back in a little bit.
[01:41:26.856 --> 01:41:27.657]  So that might be what that is.
[01:41:27.697 --> 01:41:31.821]  But we'll come back, talk about the mass graves, talk about all the Pentagon martial law drills.
[01:41:32.161 --> 01:41:35.704]  That's all real and up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:41:35.744 --> 01:41:36.145]  Stay with us.
[01:41:39.755 --> 01:41:43.357]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[01:41:43.518 --> 01:41:53.524]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[01:41:53.664 --> 01:42:00.929]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[01:42:00.969 --> 01:42:06.433]  Doctors who have tried heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results as well.
[01:42:06.613 --> 01:42:09.735]  Here's what Dr. Goodman has to say about his experience with the product.
[01:42:09.755 --> 01:42:11.156]  Call 1-866-295-5305 or go to HBExtract.com
[01:42:40.265 --> 01:42:45.472]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:42:46.075 --> 01:42:53.140]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:59.844]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:43:00.164 --> 01:43:02.046]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:43:02.206 --> 01:43:04.627]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:43:04.707 --> 01:43:15.595]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:43:16.275 --> 01:43:17.556]  It's not about left or right.
[01:43:17.956 --> 01:43:19.336]  It's about a one world government.
[01:43:19.796 --> 01:43:26.199]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:43:26.719 --> 01:43:34.522]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:43:34.982 --> 01:43:36.122]  The Obama Deception.
[01:43:36.542 --> 01:43:37.743]  The people strike back.
[01:43:39.707 --> 01:43:49.790]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:51.330]  Garden in a Can!
[01:43:51.690 --> 01:43:55.272]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[01:43:55.832 --> 01:43:57.612]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[01:43:57.852 --> 01:44:00.133]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[01:44:00.613 --> 01:44:09.678]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[01:44:10.298 --> 01:44:11.299]  Garden in a can.
[01:44:11.719 --> 01:44:12.580]  It's that simple.
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:13.220]  Fresh.
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:14.000]  Healthy.
[01:44:14.481 --> 01:44:14.781]  Easy.
[01:44:15.321 --> 01:44:19.263]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[01:44:19.663 --> 01:44:20.544]  Ready when you are.
[01:44:21.224 --> 01:44:24.867]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden In A Can.
[01:44:25.307 --> 01:44:28.410]  For more details visit GardenInACan.com today.
[01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:31.312]  That's GardenInACan.com or call 866-598-7396.
[01:44:31.332 --> 01:44:31.372]  866-598-7396.
[01:45:02.201 --> 01:45:04.563]  Okay, Inger in Florida, finish up.
[01:45:04.663 --> 01:45:10.388]  So, they also got a limestone, the chemicals that they put in the water.
[01:45:10.408 --> 01:45:15.753]  When you hear the word fluoridation, it means over 300, generally it's about 130 or so.
[01:45:15.773 --> 01:45:18.496]  We got a tour of the Austin Water Treatment.
[01:45:19.443 --> 01:45:27.706]  But it is chemical waste, and they also mine the limestone for fertilizer, for the chemicals they put in fertilizer.
[01:45:28.426 --> 01:45:34.608]  So I think just seeing some trucks drive around doesn't mean mass graves.
[01:45:35.068 --> 01:45:40.370]  All the official admissions by the federal government and the states of crematoriums and mass graves, though, does.
[01:45:41.351 --> 01:45:42.812]  And Inger, I'm not criticizing you.
[01:45:43.152 --> 01:45:44.392]  We should all keep our eyes open.
[01:45:45.012 --> 01:45:50.054]  But we can keep our eyes open for congressmen and governors saying they're getting ready for martial law and that it's bad.
[01:45:50.495 --> 01:45:53.916]  I mean, this isn't like we're looking for this or anything.
[01:45:54.976 --> 01:46:06.061]  Because the way a strawman operator works is Glenn Beck would take your call from this show and say, look, she thinks it's mass graves from limestone and he'd go to the limestone quarry and they'd say, no, we're doing this for fertilizer.
[01:46:06.661 --> 01:46:09.923]  And then, never look at the hundreds of admissions of the FEMA camp.
[01:46:09.983 --> 01:46:11.964]  See, that's how their twisted system works.
[01:46:12.004 --> 01:46:13.465]  But, tell me more about this.
[01:46:14.845 --> 01:46:17.027]  Okay, I understand exactly what you're talking about.
[01:46:17.447 --> 01:46:24.791]  And, yes, they could totally say that that wasn't what it was for, but these are hundreds and hundreds of trucks, and we've never seen them before.
[01:46:24.871 --> 01:46:26.371]  And it's just been in the last few weeks.
[01:46:26.732 --> 01:46:32.815]  And on the WHO website, it clearly says, under there, how to dispose of bodies in an emergency situation.
[01:46:33.186 --> 01:46:33.366]  I'm good.
[01:46:47.197 --> 01:46:50.478]  Um, you know, the pandemic or the flu that they're trying to hide.
[01:46:50.498 --> 01:46:53.960]  Yeah, but they may have just opened up a new aggregate mining facility.
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:59.402]  They have those all around where I live, mining marble and granite and limestone.
[01:46:59.422 --> 01:47:03.283]  I mean, all I'm saying is, ma'am, it's all admitted they're building mass graves.
[01:47:03.303 --> 01:47:04.544]  I'm not debating you on that.
[01:47:04.564 --> 01:47:07.005]  I mean, what are the trucks?
[01:47:07.045 --> 01:47:09.746]  I mean, is it blocks of, is it blocks of limestone?
[01:47:10.461 --> 01:47:17.967]  No, it's covered over in, you know, like a black tarp that you see over a truck so the stuff doesn't fly out of it.
[01:47:18.648 --> 01:47:23.252]  And what's weird is this has been going on just now for the last few weeks, and it's hundreds of trucks.
[01:47:23.592 --> 01:47:34.641]  But also, just last week in Cape Coral, on August the 7th, my husband took pictures of military helicopters, green ones, flying, and they have spray bars on them.
[01:47:35.206 --> 01:47:43.488]  And when my husband asked someone who lived in the neighborhood why, because he was just in that area for the day, why they were there, and he said, oh yeah, we saw it on the news.
[01:47:43.848 --> 01:47:50.810]  The military, the army sold the city a whole bunch of used helicopters to spray for mosquitoes.
[01:47:51.230 --> 01:47:53.130]  Well, we don't have that many mosquitoes.
[01:47:53.230 --> 01:47:54.071]  I mean, we have mosquitoes.
[01:47:54.091 --> 01:47:54.571]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:47:54.591 --> 01:47:55.851]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:47:55.871 --> 01:47:59.632]  I want to get Bob's comment here in closing on this.
[01:47:59.672 --> 01:48:02.613]  We'll take more calls with Alan Keyes coming up.
[01:48:07.034 --> 01:48:09.696]  Again, I just don't want to miss the forest for the trees here.
[01:48:11.738 --> 01:48:13.719]  They admittedly have built mass graves.
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:17.102]  They admittedly are gearing up for this, 400,000 troops.
[01:48:17.943 --> 01:48:21.986]  Whether they really release a deadly flu or not, this was clearly all staged.
[01:48:22.006 --> 01:48:26.249]  They built up for this beforehand, and they're using it to train us for federalization.
[01:48:26.730 --> 01:48:27.731]  Bob, your take on this?
[01:48:29.713 --> 01:48:40.240]  I don't see the government giving used helicopters to Charlotte County or any of that area down there.
[01:48:41.001 --> 01:48:43.002]  They've asked for them for years and got nothing.
[01:48:43.022 --> 01:48:44.983]  It happens I used to live there.
[01:48:46.924 --> 01:48:50.547]  And so I think they were military helicopters.
[01:48:51.307 --> 01:48:53.909]  And they were probably manned by military people.
[01:48:54.602 --> 01:49:02.487]  Well, I was going to say, the Army admits they do all these chemical, biological, and radiological tests on people, so they'll lie to the public with any cover story.

[01:49:15.957 --> 01:49:16.497]  I'll be there.
[01:49:16.597 --> 01:49:16.958]  Bye-bye.
[01:49:17.218 --> 01:49:17.718]  Take care.
[01:49:18.198 --> 01:49:18.619]  Stay with us.

[01:49:29.235 --> 01:49:30.316]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:49:30.616 --> 01:49:32.398]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:49:32.598 --> 01:49:33.298]  Well, you should.
[01:49:33.578 --> 01:49:37.841]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.

[01:49:56.234 --> 01:50:02.758]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:50:03.118 --> 01:50:08.301]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[01:50:32.456 --> 01:50:34.378]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:50:34.838 --> 01:50:37.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:50:55.014 --> 01:50:57.798]  Well, he is a very, very busy man.
[01:50:57.838 --> 01:51:01.063]  We're very honored to have him for the next 50 minutes or so.
[01:51:01.644 --> 01:51:06.772]  Dr. Alan Keyes, he's also an ambassador for the United States Department of State.
[01:51:08.133 --> 01:51:22.347]  Uh, Ronald Reagan appoints keys to the United Nations, uh, full ambassador, and he served on the staff of the National Security Council, sought the Republican nomination for President in 96 and 2000, ran against Barack Obama for Illinois State Senate, 2004.
[01:51:22.808 --> 01:51:25.770]  Would have been a lot better than Mr. Obama.
[01:51:26.551 --> 01:51:28.992]  And he warned people that Obama was going to be a radical.
[01:51:29.592 --> 01:51:34.273]  And I really respect Mr. Keyes, but I remember hearing this a year and a half ago, going, oh, come on.
[01:51:34.293 --> 01:51:36.494]  You know, maybe he'll be bad like Clinton.
[01:51:36.774 --> 01:51:38.094]  Who knew he could be even worse?
[01:51:38.934 --> 01:51:39.955]  And so he's with us for the next hour.
[01:51:39.975 --> 01:51:51.098]  We're going to get into that government health care, the cap and trade, the abortion, expanding funding for abortion in Asia and Africa, just his
[01:51:52.228 --> 01:51:59.452]  Ecoscience, written by the mad scientist Holdren, his science czar, which if anybody's a Nazi, it's him.
[01:52:00.053 --> 01:52:03.995]  And then these attacks on free speech, saying you can't say socialist now, it's racist.
[01:52:04.295 --> 01:52:06.496]  That's invoking the race card, in my humble opinion.
[01:52:07.197 --> 01:52:08.658]  So many issues today.
[01:52:09.418 --> 01:52:11.860]  Ambassador Keyes, it's really great to have you here, sir.
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:13.781]  I'm glad to be with you, thank you.
[01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:19.344]  We're going to break in a few minutes and come back to the full audience, but what is most important on your mind right now?
[01:52:19.564 --> 01:52:21.045]  We'll come back and cover that first.
[01:52:21.857 --> 01:52:37.408]  Well, I think there are a couple of things, but the most important thing is the assault on the Constitution, which I think right now is epitomized in the healthcare proposal, which are really seeking to transform our whole way of life, to move us from pre-government to totalitarian government.
[01:52:39.465 --> 01:52:40.867]  Well, I hardly agree with you.
[01:52:41.688 --> 01:52:57.387]  We're starting to see the establishment go from saying all the anger was staged, which obviously it isn't, over 90% of the people there are angry, and most of them Democrats in many cases, to now they're apologizing, saying, okay, you're not thugs, you're not Nazis, you're not AstroTurf.
[01:52:57.707 --> 01:52:59.089]  Is that too little, too late, though?
[01:53:00.399 --> 01:53:01.019]  Of course it is.
[01:53:01.039 --> 01:53:03.420]  I think we've seen who these people really are.
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:12.302]  Their initial reaction was the reaction of offended rulers who are looking at you saying, how dare you question us?
[01:53:12.322 --> 01:53:18.884]  And they have begun to realize that the American people aren't yet at a stage where they're going to act like the peasants and serfs of old.
[01:53:19.424 --> 01:53:25.346]  We are used to being a free people, and we're going to stand up and act like it, whether they like it or not.
[01:53:27.207 --> 01:53:27.907]  Absolutely.
[01:53:29.474 --> 01:53:31.576]  The anger is just going across the board.
[01:53:31.656 --> 01:53:36.221]  He lost two more approval points this week, or three, excuse me.
[01:53:36.601 --> 01:53:42.507]  He has the lowest approval of any president up to this date, seven months into their administration.
[01:53:44.589 --> 01:53:47.072]  What is he going to do to try to save his presidency, do you think?
[01:53:48.012 --> 01:53:49.133]  Well, I think that depends.
[01:53:49.753 --> 01:53:56.796]  I think he came forward because of a deep ideological commitment, and this is what I tried to explain to people for the longest time.
[01:53:56.876 --> 01:54:04.620]  This man is deeply committed to Marxist-Leninism, to the Communist-Marxist-Socialist understanding of the world.
[01:54:05.621 --> 01:54:14.105]  In school, in associations, in background, in both in the Illinois State Senate, in his own activities, this has been the focus of his life.
[01:54:14.885 --> 01:54:20.049]  Uh, and so he is pursuing that agenda and surrounding himself with people committed to it.
[01:54:20.069 --> 01:54:23.932]  Uh, and whatever else is going on, they're not really going to drop it.
[01:54:24.492 --> 01:54:28.475]  Uh, they may have to stop for a while, but they'll probe with a bayonet.
[01:54:28.896 --> 01:54:33.239]  They've met resistance, they'll back off, but they'll keep probing, just as Lennon told them.
[01:54:35.044 --> 01:54:36.185]  That does seem to be the tactic.
[01:54:36.205 --> 01:54:42.328]  They'll constrict, we'll fight back, and push them back a little bit, but it's the two steps forward, one step back.
[01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:44.410]  They are still going to continue to squeeze.
[01:54:44.770 --> 01:54:52.214]  In your educated opinion, working internationally at the highest levels of the White House, when we come back after this break, how do we stop them then?
[01:54:52.514 --> 01:54:54.015]  How do we stop this incremental?
[01:54:54.035 --> 01:54:56.217]  Because we can get all fired up and say no,
[01:54:57.017 --> 01:54:59.439]  But then they always just come pushing back.
[01:54:59.519 --> 01:55:03.242]  I guess we've got to get on the offensive, and then we never back off.
[01:55:03.282 --> 01:55:06.024]  I mean, I guess if we're not on the offensive, we're on the defensive.
[01:55:06.625 --> 01:55:09.347]  That's right, and I think it's important to do a simple thing.
[01:55:09.888 --> 01:55:12.550]  We're not opposed to their proposals, we're opposed to them.
[01:55:15.552 --> 01:55:16.873]  Well, they've proven they're liars.
[01:55:16.913 --> 01:55:18.775]  I mean, you can't believe a word they say, so.
[01:55:19.315 --> 01:55:21.817]  It's kind of like you have a neighbor you've caught lying to you over and over again.
[01:55:21.837 --> 01:55:23.479]  You just stop associating with them.
[01:55:26.032 --> 01:55:31.414]  You certainly start trusting them, and I think we can trust them to continue the march to socialism.
[01:55:31.474 --> 01:55:35.015]  If we don't want it, then we have to look at another direction for leadership.
[01:55:36.356 --> 01:55:38.596]  Ambassador Keyes is our guest.
[01:55:38.716 --> 01:55:39.697]  Alan Keyes, stay with us.
[01:55:39.717 --> 01:55:44.538]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:55:44.759 --> 01:55:48.560]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:54.362]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:55:54.682 --> 01:55:55.122]  It's true.
[01:55:55.322 --> 01:55:59.543]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:55:59.763 --> 01:55:59.983]  Number 3.
[01:56:00.664 --> 01:56:06.105]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:56:06.285 --> 01:56:06.765]  Number 4.
[01:56:06.965 --> 01:56:09.626]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:56:09.866 --> 01:56:13.287]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:56:13.527 --> 01:56:13.727]  Number 5.
[01:56:14.367 --> 01:56:17.988]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:56:18.228 --> 01:56:23.713]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:42.373]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:56:42.793 --> 01:56:47.759]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:56:48.119 --> 01:56:49.861]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:56:50.181 --> 01:56:54.987]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:56:55.187 --> 01:56:56.088]  How much do you want?
[01:56:56.348 --> 01:56:57.089]  When do you want it?
[01:56:57.469 --> 01:56:59.070]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:56:59.350 --> 01:57:00.171]  When will you need it?
[01:57:00.431 --> 01:57:02.492]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:57:02.632 --> 01:57:03.733]  Will there be any food?
[01:57:03.973 --> 01:57:05.314]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:57:05.494 --> 01:57:10.558]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:57:10.758 --> 01:57:13.960]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:17.823]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:57:18.163 --> 01:57:19.143]  How much will you need?
[01:57:19.383 --> 01:57:20.003]  We don't know.
[01:57:20.284 --> 01:57:21.184]  How much do you want?
[01:57:21.404 --> 01:57:22.104]  All you can get.
[01:57:22.124 --> 01:57:23.164]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:23.424 --> 01:57:26.185]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:57:26.465 --> 01:57:28.666]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:57:28.706 --> 01:57:29.666]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:57:39.175 --> 01:57:48.299]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:57:48.459 --> 01:57:56.482]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[01:57:56.622 --> 01:57:56.922]  In fact,
[01:57:57.122 --> 01:58:01.124]  Clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[01:58:01.204 --> 01:58:03.826]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[01:58:03.966 --> 01:58:15.273]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[01:58:15.533 --> 01:58:21.717]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[01:58:21.977 --> 01:58:25.699]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an
[01:58:25.899 --> 01:58:29.722]  Excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.

[01:58:32.784 --> 01:58:34.986]  Again, that's FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[01:58:35.126 --> 01:58:35.706]  Or call 888-949-3570.
[01:58:35.786 --> 01:58:37.227]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:58:37.288 --> 01:58:41.010]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:50.695 --> 01:58:57.619]  Well, he's a best-selling author, researcher, former ambassador to the United Nations under Ronald Reagan.
[01:58:57.939 --> 01:59:00.541]  He needs no introduction.
[01:59:00.641 --> 01:59:03.943]  One of his websites is loyaltoliberty.blogspot.com.
[01:59:04.363 --> 01:59:10.267]  Got that up on screen as we simulcast the radio show on the web slash as a TV show.
[01:59:10.287 --> 01:59:12.988]  He also writes for World Daily and other big publications.
[01:59:13.569 --> 01:59:15.450]  Unhealthy for Liberty is one of his latest
[01:59:16.110 --> 01:59:16.390]  I think?
[01:59:32.642 --> 01:59:40.645]  We see the town halls, the people, Republican, Democrat, old, young, black, white, coming out and saying, we don't want this.
[01:59:40.685 --> 01:59:43.426]  And they have copies of the bill, they have the subsections.
[01:59:43.786 --> 01:59:49.868]  The Democrats for three weeks tried to lie, and even some Republicans did, and say, that's not in there, this isn't in there.
[01:59:49.928 --> 01:59:54.770]  Now they're having to admit all the things we said were in there that were in there, and apologizing
[01:59:57.856 --> 02:00:00.398]  How do we ensure that this resistance continues?
[02:00:00.418 --> 02:00:04.420]  Because as you just said, they're going to continue to come back, probing.
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:07.261]  You know, they put the pressure on, we resist, they back off.
[02:00:08.682 --> 02:00:15.326]  I mean, give us your battle plan of how to not just hold them off, but actually regain some ground.
[02:00:15.586 --> 02:00:17.647]  Because you know, Ambassador, we've lost so much liberty.
[02:00:18.688 --> 02:00:22.090]  Well, I think that we have to be clear about what it is we're opposing.
[02:00:23.102 --> 02:00:33.530]  Because I think that the present overwhelming response to this health care program reminds me a little of what happened on the immigration bill when they were trying to destroy our sovereignty.
[02:00:34.571 --> 02:00:39.195]  You're not just looking at an opposition to specific proposals and elements.
[02:00:39.947 --> 02:01:02.240]  I think what happened is, some of these things, particularly for instance, the provisions that seem targeted at rationing care for the elderly, at setting up a system that would pressure people into accepting death and giving up therapy, side by side with provisions that might expand funding for illegal immigrants, which would therefore be being paid at the expense of
[02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:05.103]  Our loved one being encouraged to die.
[02:01:05.644 --> 02:01:09.888]  These things were rejected because they fundamentally offend conscience.
[02:01:10.309 --> 02:01:16.336]  They seem contrary to the American way of life and the understanding we have of the intrinsic worth of human beings.
[02:01:17.076 --> 02:01:20.941]  With that in mind, you look at the whole picture, there are the invasive elements.
[02:01:21.381 --> 02:01:28.184]  Uh, that would take control, first of all, of the health sector, of the terms of remuneration of doctors and things of this kind.
[02:01:28.584 --> 02:01:32.506]  So they claim that it's not aimed at phasing out the private sector.
[02:01:32.526 --> 02:01:33.326]  Two things are true.
[02:01:34.266 --> 02:01:40.969]  Barack Obama himself, in his early career, explicitly said he was for universal single payer, right?
[02:01:42.013 --> 02:01:50.217]  And then it comes out a proposal that has elements in it that, yes, over the course of a little time are going to push the system in that direction.
[02:01:50.538 --> 02:01:58.361]  And these elements are backed by the big corporate guys who are trying to get out from under the health care cost so they can have bigger profits.
[02:01:58.642 --> 02:02:01.843]  Are we all supposed to be stupid that we don't realize what's happening?
[02:02:01.883 --> 02:02:02.343]  Of course not.
[02:02:02.363 --> 02:02:03.244]  People do realize it.
[02:02:04.509 --> 02:02:27.248]  Then you look at what's going on overseas, with Canada and Great Britain as other examples, and it turns out that there is rationing, there is pressure for the old people, there are long lines, there is poor access, there is lower quality in terms of medical personnel and so forth, and so the notion that everybody's going to have access is countervailed by the fact that they'll have access to a worse system
[02:02:27.808 --> 02:02:39.171]  In which they'll get worse service, in which they will no longer have the sense that a whole bunch of people have in America, that when something goes wrong with you, it's dealt with expeditiously, right?
[02:02:39.551 --> 02:02:40.472]  That won't even be there.
[02:02:40.832 --> 02:02:44.133]  And so I think people are looking at this saying, wait a minute, this is not America.
[02:02:44.473 --> 02:02:45.653]  This is not how we live.
[02:02:46.582 --> 02:02:51.146]  And we have been relying on a system that, yes, has its shortcomings.
[02:02:51.326 --> 02:03:03.537]  You know, they say that we're supposed to let government take over 100% of our lives because we want to care for the 10% of people who they say don't have access to some kind of health insurance right now.
[02:03:03.557 --> 02:03:04.598]  That doesn't make sense!
[02:03:05.222 --> 02:03:07.923]  So, I think a lot of people have begun to suspect the truth.
[02:03:08.363 --> 02:03:10.344]  The aim of this isn't to improve healthcare.
[02:03:10.684 --> 02:03:31.472]  The aim of it is to give that power to government over life and death and finances and privacy and personal decisions, so that we'll be in a position where we must hang on the decisions and words and power of the people in power, which gives them great control, so that they can remain in power at our expense.
[02:03:31.952 --> 02:03:34.874]  That is what totalitarian government is all about.
[02:03:34.934 --> 02:03:36.795]  That's what socialist takeovers are about.
[02:03:37.095 --> 02:03:40.497]  They use issues in order to achieve power.
[02:03:40.677 --> 02:03:42.799]  They're not really interested in the result.
[02:03:44.039 --> 02:03:47.041]  Wow, Ambassador Allen Keyes is our guest.
[02:03:47.201 --> 02:03:51.024]  Absolutely amazing how you just laid it all out and everything you were saying there
[02:03:52.071 --> 02:04:08.973]  is true because right in front of me today ABC News and MSNBC and the New York Times in my stack they spin it like it's good and they go look the big insurance companies look the big doctors unions look all these special interests are getting together
[02:04:09.734 --> 02:04:24.702]  Uh, with this 12 million dollar, uh, ad package that the healthcare plan's good, and really that is all it is, is big corporations really want it so they can then have liability protection to not give people the care they've already paid for, and then the...
[02:04:25.362 --> 02:04:31.210]  Congressman Conyers says they can't read a 1300 page bill, but the government can then implement all our health care.
[02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:38.179]  I mean, they can't get anything right, and really they're just grabbing the whole industry for themselves.
[02:04:38.199 --> 02:04:40.963]  So I'd like you to comment on that, and then secondarily,
[02:04:41.804 --> 02:04:53.910]  It's come out that White House-funded groups, ACORN and others, I mean here's the actual ad, defend President Obama's health care plan over August recess, $500 a week, now is your chance to make health care work.
[02:04:54.330 --> 02:05:00.973]  Here they are, JobsThatMatter.org, a Democratic-funded group, paying people and then they got caught
[02:05:01.853 --> 02:05:17.192]  Obama can't plant fake document and Shay Guevara fan at Jackson Lee Forum and they got caught with this woman who works for this lady right here in the shot who works with Obama famously in the photo with her and Shay Guevara.
[02:05:17.913 --> 02:05:29.917]  And then here she is, faking, going to staged questioners, posing as doctors, saying, so even the few people that they go to at their own town halls, it's staged, Ambassador!
[02:05:30.157 --> 02:05:33.778]  They've been accusing us of it being staged, they are caught staging it!
[02:05:34.379 --> 02:05:40.901]  Well, see, but this corresponds, and I hope a lot of people, well, maybe a lot of people don't, but one of the standard practices
[02:05:41.605 --> 02:05:44.189]  Of the old communists, right, in the 20th century.
[02:05:44.530 --> 02:05:49.157]  Was to accuse their opponents of doing the things that they themselves do, routinely.
[02:05:49.978 --> 02:05:52.080]  And that's exactly what has been happening here.
[02:05:52.401 --> 02:06:02.090]  That particularly is with respect to these staged meetings in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries under communism, under these dictators in the third world.
[02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:14.442]  This idea of the staged event where you pretend you've got all kinds of public support when you've actually ham-picked people to come out and do show trials, as it were, and show press conferences and all of that, that's standard practice.
[02:06:14.802 --> 02:06:18.003]  These people are simply showing themselves to be exactly what they are.
[02:06:18.403 --> 02:06:37.727]  A bunch of leftists following the handbook of the communists, trying to impose this system on the people of the United States against our will, with lies and staged manipulations of perception and so forth, exactly as Olinsky and others have recommended to the left-wingers that they do.
[02:06:38.087 --> 02:06:38.967]  It also, of course,
[02:06:39.907 --> 02:06:47.394]  Max of the tactics that were used during the era of the first National Socialist Bush, the right-wing National Socialists, we call them Nazis, right?
[02:06:48.755 --> 02:06:57.143]  And they had the same kind of approaches for manipulating politics and practiced the same effort to vilify their opponents.
[02:06:57.983 --> 02:07:14.769]  And to dehumanize them in various ways with name-calling and junk like this, just as these people are now trying to pretend that anybody who looks at this on the basis of the facts, analyzes it in light of the ideology and what it's all about, calls what they're doing socialism.
[02:07:14.989 --> 02:07:18.691]  And you've had these people standing up and saying, well that's racist, that's just a code word for rape.
[02:07:19.171 --> 02:07:20.491]  What nonsense is this?
[02:07:20.871 --> 02:07:22.432]  Do they really think we're that stupid?
[02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:27.990]  Well, I mean, they clearly, Ambassador, and I want your opinion on this, it's cold-blooded!
[02:07:28.170 --> 02:07:29.010]  They know!
[02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:46.454]  They took all these well-meaning people that voted for Obama, I know a lot of rednecks around here in Texas did, to prove they weren't racist, wanting to have everybody live together in peace, and then now cold-bloodedly these poverty pimps, these Annenberg Foundation people, these Ford Foundation people,
[02:07:47.234 --> 02:08:13.600]  knowingly come in and say if you disagree with cap-and-trade if you disagree with his policies on government health care you are a racist and I get hundreds of emails a week saying that I'm secretly a white supremacist because we posted the Obama Joker photos saying socialism I mean isn't that really the racism or invoking the racism as divide-and-conquer cold-bloodedly is it
[02:08:14.670 --> 02:08:20.073]  And then, think about it, the whole Obama effort was a cold-blooded invocation of race.
[02:08:21.174 --> 02:08:26.337]  Everything about what these people did was a cold-blooded effort to play the race card.
[02:08:27.177 --> 02:08:28.718]  And that's what it was all about.
[02:08:29.619 --> 02:08:41.486]  And the whole idea that you should vote for somebody not because of the color of their skin, but because of their qualities and characteristics and your agreement with what they were trying to do that was right for the country, that they threw out.
[02:08:42.626 --> 02:08:50.871]  And of course, now they want it thrown out because most people look at what he's up to, realize that people like myself were not exaggerating.
[02:08:51.411 --> 02:08:55.013]  You had a lot of people that said, oh, that's just extremism, you're exaggerating.
[02:08:55.033 --> 02:08:55.993]  No, he's not like that.
[02:08:56.054 --> 02:08:57.534]  His speeches are so moderate.
[02:08:57.874 --> 02:09:01.897]  But that's because as we're discovering, the man's a pathological liar.
[02:09:01.977 --> 02:09:02.457]  I'm sorry.
[02:09:03.106 --> 02:09:05.609]  He lies, and he is studied at it.
[02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:07.010]  He is skillful at it.
[02:09:07.070 --> 02:09:12.816]  He is a shrewd actor, as it were, that turns his whole person and delivery into the lie.
[02:09:13.156 --> 02:09:15.759]  But nonetheless, it does not correspond with the truth.
[02:09:17.018 --> 02:09:19.859]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[02:09:19.919 --> 02:09:22.601]  You live in Illinois, you knew him, and I respect you.
[02:09:22.641 --> 02:09:27.683]  I interviewed you for D Magazine back in the mid-90s, interviewed you again on radio many years ago.
[02:09:28.183 --> 02:09:30.584]  I respected you and thought that you were right.
[02:09:31.284 --> 02:09:35.526]  I just thought, well, Keyes doesn't usually have any rhetoric, but man, is Obama this bad?
[02:09:35.546 --> 02:09:44.130]  I mean, I wasn't for Obama, but I remember the speeches you gave and the warnings, and now it's all true, and that's what's concerning me.
[02:09:45.150 --> 02:09:47.472]  This is one of the problems I guess I have in life.
[02:09:47.912 --> 02:09:54.397]  I'm dealing with issues right now, whether it's the healthcare issue, the eligibility issue, people always try to pretend that there's some motive involved.
[02:09:54.778 --> 02:09:58.000]  I just try to look at things and call them as I see them.
[02:09:58.530 --> 02:10:04.972]  Based on the knowledge and experience that I've had, I try to clearly share with people conclusions that I think make sense.
[02:10:05.672 --> 02:10:09.053]  And that's what I tried to do in that case, and the facts were clear.
[02:10:09.473 --> 02:10:18.695]  And therefore, I feel that if you're a public person, you have an obligation to share that true understanding as best you can with the people that you're talking to.
[02:10:19.847 --> 02:10:25.775]  Well, since you gave those speeches and talked about him wanting to force abort babies, it's now been confirmed.
[02:10:26.135 --> 02:10:26.876]  Let's go over.
[02:10:26.996 --> 02:10:29.460]  You know this gentleman.
[02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:32.784]  You know who the president really is and who his controllers are.
[02:10:33.124 --> 02:10:36.389]  So let us in to your expertise on the other side.
[02:10:36.769 --> 02:10:37.971]  Ambassador Keyes is our guest.
[02:10:39.946 --> 02:10:41.187]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:10:41.247 --> 02:10:46.593]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:10:46.833 --> 02:10:51.458]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:10:51.858 --> 02:10:52.238]  It's true.
[02:10:52.318 --> 02:10:54.901]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:10:55.141 --> 02:10:56.883]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:10:57.409 --> 02:11:02.110]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:11:02.631 --> 02:11:04.551]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:11:04.951 --> 02:11:09.553]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:11:09.753 --> 02:11:10.653]  And here's the best part.
[02:11:10.873 --> 02:11:13.614]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:11:13.634 --> 02:11:17.235]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:11:17.555 --> 02:11:20.396]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:11:20.736 --> 02:11:22.637]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:11:22.977 --> 02:11:23.897]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:11:27.538 --> 02:11:29.301]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:11:30.503 --> 02:11:36.291]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:11:36.611 --> 02:11:38.995]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:11:40.288 --> 02:11:45.590]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:11:46.091 --> 02:11:53.074]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:11:53.674 --> 02:11:59.837]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[02:12:00.257 --> 02:12:02.078]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:12:02.238 --> 02:12:04.639]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:12:04.739 --> 02:12:15.685]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:12:16.306 --> 02:12:17.586]  It's not about left or right.
[02:12:17.987 --> 02:12:19.347]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:12:19.848 --> 02:12:26.091]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:12:35.011 --> 02:12:36.153]  The Obama Deception.
[02:12:36.594 --> 02:12:37.776]  The people strike back!
[02:12:39.508 --> 02:12:39.848]  Good day.
[02:12:40.068 --> 02:12:41.489]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:12:41.749 --> 02:12:42.029]  August 14th, 2009.
[02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.910]  Gold open this morning at $9.5910.
[02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:45.891]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.8644, $4.9322 for the half ounce, or $2.4661 for a quarter ounce.
[02:12:45.931 --> 02:12:46.511]  That's $9.8644, $4.9322, and $2.4661.
[02:12:57.612 --> 02:13:08.401]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:13:08.521 --> 02:13:11.764]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:13:11.884 --> 02:13:15.347]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[02:13:15.407 --> 02:13:18.290]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:21.332]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[02:13:21.412 --> 02:13:23.834]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:13:24.495 --> 02:13:26.756]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[02:13:26.896 --> 02:13:27.617]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:13:27.797 --> 02:13:33.762]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[02:13:33.782 --> 02:13:33.962]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:13:40.146 --> 02:13:40.626]  Attention!
[02:13:40.827 --> 02:13:55.878]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[02:13:56.178 --> 02:14:04.622]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica and packed with a negative charge that attracts positive toxins from the blood, organs, spine and brain.
[02:14:04.802 --> 02:14:10.504]  This product has the ability to rebuild cartilage and bone which allows synovial fluid to return to the joints.
[02:14:10.744 --> 02:14:16.487]  Silica is a precursor to calcium meaning the body turns silica into calcium and is great for the heart.
[02:14:16.607 --> 02:14:24.070]  There is no better time than now to have micro plant powder on your shelf or in your storage shelter and with an unlimited shelf life you can
[02:14:24.070 --> 02:14:25.231]  You can store it anywhere.
[02:14:25.471 --> 02:14:30.535]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org.
[02:14:30.795 --> 02:14:32.556]  It's a great way to change your life.
[02:14:32.796 --> 02:14:39.001]  So call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[02:14:39.021 --> 02:14:45.646]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:46.306 --> 02:14:48.608]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:14:50.251 --> 02:14:58.815]  Loyalty2Liberty.blogspot.com Ambassador Keyes, are there any other sites or books or materials?
[02:14:59.475 --> 02:15:00.716]  What's some of your latest work?
[02:15:00.736 --> 02:15:01.956]  The World Net Daily articles?
[02:15:03.237 --> 02:15:08.619]  The major outlets for what I write these days, the most important one is Loyal to Liberty.
[02:15:08.639 --> 02:15:12.801]  That's Loyal to Liberty, L-O-Y-A-L-T-O-L-I-B-E-R-T-Y.
[02:15:12.841 --> 02:15:14.262]  You can also reach it, by the way,
[02:15:14.942 --> 02:15:16.843]  Just by typing in alankeys.com.
[02:15:16.963 --> 02:15:19.043]  A-L-A-N-K-E-Y-E-S dot com.
[02:15:19.463 --> 02:15:20.424]  It goes to the same place.
[02:15:21.024 --> 02:15:28.546]  Because that's now become my major vehicle for sharing on a regular basis thoughts and writings of various lengths with people.
[02:15:28.586 --> 02:15:36.688]  I'm also serializing what I hope will become a couple of books that periodically I'm putting chapters up on the blog there for people to look at.
[02:15:37.308 --> 02:15:38.489]  Uh, and so forth.
[02:15:38.569 --> 02:15:48.276]  I also am writing for Walnut Valley, and I'm heavily involved in the work of America's Independent Party, which has a website, AIPnews.com.
[02:15:52.479 --> 02:16:10.576]  Which is essentially an effort both to sign up people for a political effort where we're standing on common principles from the get-go and everybody commits to those things so that we're not going to be throwing them aside in order to just achieve office at any price.
[02:16:10.836 --> 02:16:14.620]  But it also corresponds to my view that in today's world,
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:16.521]  We want to take America back.
[02:16:16.561 --> 02:16:18.282]  The people must become the media.
[02:16:18.703 --> 02:16:35.295]  We must use the tools that are available so we're no longer relying on the corporate bought-and-paid-for media outlets that now are working for some of these big business enterprises that are essentially the fellow travelers of the Obama Socialists.
[02:16:35.868 --> 02:16:45.751]  And that more and more is happening, so they're openly saying, with the hate crimes law and the cyberbullying, that if something hurts someone's feelings, you're going to be federally charged.
[02:16:45.771 --> 02:16:47.892]  That's actually in the bills, I couldn't believe it.
[02:16:48.732 --> 02:16:53.054]  And especially the cyberbullying, so they're certainly coming after our free speech.
[02:16:53.074 --> 02:16:59.016]  They're not only saying that, saying it's socialism, is racist,
[02:16:59.946 --> 02:17:05.349]  Which is incredible race-baiting in my opinion, and as you said, cold-bloodedly using it to drive a wedge.
[02:17:06.669 --> 02:17:20.776]  But they're now calling for the arrest of people that put up Obama posters on light poles, but Obama was in the Washington Post telling his supporters to put up his hope sign on stop signs, which is illegal.
[02:17:21.136 --> 02:17:23.437]  So, just the level of hypocrisy.
[02:17:24.158 --> 02:17:34.868]  Well, I think, though, it goes beyond hypocrisy, because hypocrisy would imply that it's almost just a function of the circumstances of a particular case.
[02:17:35.148 --> 02:17:35.589]  It's not.
[02:17:36.369 --> 02:17:43.276]  This is the strategy whereby you dehumanize, demoralize, and destroy any opposition.
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:50.746]  Uh, you build up your own camp so that they become the exclusive, have the exclusive access, really, uh, to public opinion.
[02:17:51.246 --> 02:17:57.371]  Uh, and then you try to mobilize the force of law and law enforcement and the state.
[02:17:57.991 --> 02:18:02.675]  Uh, eventually, including, of course, arresting and trying people and throwing them into jail or camp.
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:07.021]  Because they are dissenting from your policy.
[02:18:07.581 --> 02:18:16.423]  That's something that was systematically characteristic of these socialist regimes of the right and left, whether it's the Nazi regime or the old Soviet regime.
[02:18:16.823 --> 02:18:21.064]  These socialist regimes, all of them took this approach to politics.
[02:18:21.704 --> 02:18:32.587]  And of course they also adopted the famous Rahm Emanuel repeated dictum that you want to take advantage of a good crisis, right?
[02:18:33.545 --> 02:18:38.190]  And that of course includes manufacturing it if you don't have one.
[02:18:38.931 --> 02:18:42.034]  So that if you don't have a good crisis, you make one up, you cause one.
[02:18:42.435 --> 02:18:45.638]  I think that's one of the reasons why he's so irresponsible about spending.
[02:18:45.658 --> 02:18:55.389]  He actually wants to push us deeper and deeper into a critical and desperate economic situation that will justify consolidating more and more power.
[02:18:55.849 --> 02:18:58.932]  In the hands of the government that he controls.
[02:18:58.952 --> 02:19:00.353]  That's a standard practice.
[02:19:00.893 --> 02:19:07.619]  It just breaks my heart that because of the end of the Cold War, you know, when we were actively confronted by the Soviets.
[02:19:08.246 --> 02:19:15.189]  People were more aware on a daily basis of who these people were, what they did, what practices they carried forward.
[02:19:15.430 --> 02:19:18.891]  It was something that you grew up with and knew and understood.
[02:19:19.191 --> 02:19:32.738]  I think we have now had, what is it, 20, 30 years in which that's become less and less the case, and you have a lot of folks now who don't realize that what we're watching is simply part of a pattern that was common from the mid-20th century forward.
[02:19:33.294 --> 02:19:36.597]  Yeah, in case you don't know, sir, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:19:37.117 --> 02:19:45.064]  We have at least six different, in English, two in Spanish, Florida news reports, and several of them call for my arrest.
[02:19:45.905 --> 02:19:47.927]  I didn't come up with the Obama Joker poster.
[02:19:47.967 --> 02:19:49.047]  I saw it in LA.
[02:19:49.468 --> 02:19:51.870]  Nationally, they said it was racist, you should be arrested.
[02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:56.574]  So I put it up on my site, and I said, folks, we've got to stand up to this attack on free speech.
[02:19:56.674 --> 02:19:58.616]  Post these in legal places everywhere.
[02:19:59.276 --> 02:20:02.277]  Now, they're on the news calling for my arrest.
[02:20:02.877 --> 02:20:05.558]  So, I can think of nothing more un-American, Ambassador.
[02:20:05.578 --> 02:20:10.439]  I want to get your take on that and get back to the question of, you know what makes them tick.
[02:20:10.779 --> 02:20:12.399]  You've been proven to be right about them.
[02:20:12.479 --> 02:20:13.659]  What are they going to try next?
[02:20:14.660 --> 02:20:20.401]  And then I want to get into some other issues like governors oppose DOD emergency powers.
[02:20:21.321 --> 02:20:26.903]  Obama wants to put 400,000 troops on the streets of America.
[02:20:27.343 --> 02:20:28.283]  You can't make this up.
[02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:32.834]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:20:33.756 --> 02:20:36.439]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:20:39.329 --> 02:20:43.293]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:20:43.573 --> 02:20:45.335]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:20:45.575 --> 02:20:53.843]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:20:54.084 --> 02:20:59.329]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:20:59.649 --> 02:21:01.271]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:21:01.491 --> 02:21:07.814]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:21:08.014 --> 02:21:18.759]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:21:19.059 --> 02:21:20.440]  That's right, clean water.
[02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:21.100]  We're good to go.
[02:21:39.212 --> 02:21:44.399]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:21:44.539 --> 02:21:46.482]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:21:46.622 --> 02:21:48.905]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:21:49.065 --> 02:21:50.908]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:21:51.348 --> 02:21:52.690]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:21:52.970 --> 02:21:53.992]  There is a solution.
[02:21:54.212 --> 02:22:02.236]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:22:02.657 --> 02:22:09.721]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:22:10.101 --> 02:22:15.764]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:22:16.124 --> 02:22:21.709]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:22:22.149 --> 02:22:25.952]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:22:26.312 --> 02:22:33.458]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[02:22:33.778 --> 02:22:37.081]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:22:39.938 --> 02:22:44.220]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:49.361]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:22:49.561 --> 02:22:50.882]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:22:51.062 --> 02:22:54.543]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:22:54.683 --> 02:22:59.845]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:23:00.085 --> 02:23:05.847]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:23:06.187 --> 02:23:08.629]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:23:08.709 --> 02:23:11.031]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[02:23:11.231 --> 02:23:13.352]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[02:23:13.652 --> 02:23:14.653]  No harsh chemicals.
[02:23:14.873 --> 02:23:15.794]  No animal testing.
[02:23:16.054 --> 02:23:17.195]  I use them and love them.
[02:23:17.395 --> 02:23:18.976]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:23:19.276 --> 02:23:20.137]  And I save big time.
[02:23:20.697 --> 02:23:22.278]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:23:22.398 --> 02:23:22.739]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[02:23:22.759 --> 02:23:25.260]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[02:23:32.165 --> 02:23:34.650]  Again that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:23:43.865 --> 02:23:46.967]  We're going back to Ambassador Alan Keyes here in just a moment.
[02:23:47.007 --> 02:23:50.989]  His website is LoyalToLiberty.blogspot.com.
[02:23:51.029 --> 02:23:53.370]  We've got that up on the screen right now.
[02:23:53.390 --> 02:23:54.991]  Everybody, we'll give it to you again before he leaves us.
[02:23:55.231 --> 02:23:56.592]  He's with us right to the end of the show.
[02:23:56.612 --> 02:23:58.914]  Another 25 minutes or so, very honored to have him.
[02:23:58.974 --> 02:24:02.876]  I want to thank the sponsor of this hour of the show, Acola Blue.
[02:24:03.721 --> 02:24:05.702]  And it is an atmospheric water generator.
[02:24:05.742 --> 02:24:12.286]  It grabs seven and a half gallons out of the air a day and then sends it through reverse osmosis, a carbon filter, a bunch of other stuff.
[02:24:12.346 --> 02:24:13.547]  It's just a great unit.
[02:24:14.027 --> 02:24:15.188]  Ecoloblue.com.
[02:24:15.328 --> 02:24:17.069]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.
[02:24:17.369 --> 02:24:20.091]  Again, that's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[02:24:20.471 --> 02:24:21.231]  Or give them a call at 800-691-6043.
[02:24:24.679 --> 02:24:25.540]  I have this in the office.
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:26.520]  I have this in my home.
[02:24:27.181 --> 02:24:28.822]  Just an amazing system.
[02:24:29.662 --> 02:24:31.103]  And it doesn't come out of the tap.
[02:24:31.384 --> 02:24:32.384]  There's no fluoride.
[02:24:32.444 --> 02:24:32.925]  Nothing in it.
[02:24:33.305 --> 02:24:34.526]  And then it goes through seven filters.
[02:24:34.566 --> 02:24:37.948]  A coloblue.com or 800-691-6043.
[02:24:37.968 --> 02:24:38.148]  800-691-6043.
[02:24:38.208 --> 02:24:44.592]  And I remember years ago listening to Mr. Key's radio show.
[02:24:44.652 --> 02:24:45.193]  So informative.
[02:24:45.213 --> 02:24:46.093]  He doesn't do that anymore.
[02:24:46.394 --> 02:24:50.216]  But he's all over talk radio and TV and we always enjoy having him.
[02:24:50.496 --> 02:24:51.717]  And he got arrested!
[02:24:52.117 --> 02:24:53.999]  You could be there pro-abortion.
[02:24:54.879 --> 02:24:55.820]  You just couldn't be against it.
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:58.343]  We're going to talk about that coming up in a few minutes.
[02:24:58.383 --> 02:25:02.427]  But sir, I continue with the free speech issue.
[02:25:03.007 --> 02:25:10.695]  How can you put up signs with Bush as the joker, Bush as a vampire, and I wasn't a fan of Bush tripling the size of government.
[02:25:10.735 --> 02:25:14.939]  Now, Obama's tripled it in seven, eight months though, so he obviously even worse.
[02:25:14.959 --> 02:25:15.940]  I didn't know that was possible.
[02:25:16.321 --> 02:25:18.343]  How do you, how do these people
[02:25:19.724 --> 02:25:21.344]  In fact, take the Village Voice.
[02:25:21.664 --> 02:25:25.585]  They put out, Bush is the vampire, killing the Statue of Liberty, drinking its blood.
[02:25:25.986 --> 02:25:36.428]  The very artist came out and said, no, it's okay to show Bush bad, but because Obama is partially African, you are not allowed to.
[02:25:36.508 --> 02:25:39.729]  I mean, it's just, they've got so much bravado.
[02:25:40.049 --> 02:25:43.230]  They're just so incredibly arrogant.
[02:25:43.690 --> 02:25:46.791]  And just so over the top, they have no shame.
[02:25:47.131 --> 02:25:51.052]  Can you comment on what makes them tick and the attacks on your free speech?
[02:25:51.632 --> 02:25:54.112]  Well, first of all, I think it's purely ideological.
[02:25:54.152 --> 02:25:59.173]  These people come from a point of view which basically says, whatever we say goes.
[02:25:59.433 --> 02:26:01.314]  If we do it, then it's acceptable.
[02:26:01.374 --> 02:26:03.394]  If our opponents do it, then it's unacceptable.
[02:26:04.014 --> 02:26:11.516]  And you make them suffer for what they do in whatever way you can because there is no such thing as a standard of truth.
[02:26:12.168 --> 02:26:15.450]  That's the most important thing to keep in mind when listening to their words and everything.
[02:26:15.490 --> 02:26:37.744]  The ordinary notion that you are trying to speak the truth and make sense and that you have respect for some standard of reasonableness and common sense and logic and factuality, none of it applies to them, as it did not apply to the people who edited Pravda in the old Soviet Union, as it never applies, did not apply to the Goebbels propaganda under the Nazis.
[02:26:37.844 --> 02:26:40.506]  These people aren't about speaking the truth.
[02:26:41.246 --> 02:26:53.404]  They are simply about imposing their will by manipulating people's minds, by cutting off others so that they won't have access, won't be able to make arguments, and only allow it.
[02:26:54.241 --> 02:26:57.263]  Their voice and their understanding and their interpretation to be heard.
[02:26:57.904 --> 02:27:00.766]  And they are moving forward to implement that understanding.
[02:27:01.327 --> 02:27:09.033]  Which of course is contrary to everything that Americans have professed to believe over the course of pretty much our entire history.
[02:27:09.053 --> 02:27:19.941]  Since that notion of free and open and sometimes even raucous discussion and debate has been a hallmark of what our society is all about.
[02:27:19.981 --> 02:27:21.623]  But now that's being thrown away.
[02:27:22.754 --> 02:27:29.158]  Ambassador, specifically, you've grown up, lived in Illinois, you know him as a state senator, as a U.S.
[02:27:29.178 --> 02:27:34.481]  senator, you're aware of his activities, so can you give us a snapshot of him?
[02:27:34.521 --> 02:27:36.903]  Because, I mean, specifically, here's the question, though.
[02:27:37.859 --> 02:27:43.123]  Even if you agree with his policies or disagree, I've never seen one this flagrantly or slickly lie.
[02:27:43.424 --> 02:27:45.505]  He makes Clinton look like a poor liar.
[02:27:45.906 --> 02:27:46.826]  He's a great actor.
[02:27:46.846 --> 02:27:51.510]  He should be in Hollywood because he gets up and says, I will have no lobbyists anywhere.
[02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:52.691]  They will not write the laws.
[02:27:52.971 --> 02:27:54.553]  He hires more than anybody ever has.
[02:27:54.853 --> 02:27:56.654]  He says, I'll have total transparency.
[02:27:56.955 --> 02:28:00.638]  He keeps all of Cheney's secrecy and more, and then even makes it secret
[02:28:01.098 --> 02:28:04.659]  Who comes to the White House, where you even worked, taking it to a new level?
[02:28:04.679 --> 02:28:16.642]  So can you comment on knowing who he really is, and how he seems to enjoy lying, and one of the few people I've seen who can lie, and it looks like he's telling the truth.
[02:28:17.643 --> 02:28:20.043]  Well, first of all, I don't want to pretend.
[02:28:20.463 --> 02:28:22.384]  One, I did not grow up in Illinois.
[02:28:23.064 --> 02:28:26.025]  You know I ran there, but I ran there on invitation.
[02:28:27.498 --> 02:28:40.681]  I learned about Barack Obama as I was engaging in the preparations and carrying out of that campaign effort.
[02:28:40.981 --> 02:28:47.023]  It is not a personal thing, and I never pretend that I have some special personal slant on Barack Obama.
[02:28:47.083 --> 02:28:47.843]  I don't know about that.
[02:28:48.363 --> 02:29:12.289]  What I do know, I know from facts, from the positions he's taken, and from the facts that one can garner and that are now being shared on the internet and elsewhere, but that were hidden from the American people because the media clack of the Obama faction, the people who are kind of stupefied by their zealous support of Obama, did not share these facts with the American people.
[02:29:12.809 --> 02:29:15.112]  Uh, and so they were promoting a false understanding.
[02:29:15.552 --> 02:29:19.697]  Uh, so in a sense, I came at Barack Obama from an objective point of view.
[02:29:20.077 --> 02:29:23.721]  Not from a point of view of any kind of special knowledge or animus of any kind.
[02:29:23.741 --> 02:29:25.203]  Uh, like a lot of Americans.
[02:29:25.283 --> 02:29:26.925]  I didn't even know him from Adam.
[02:29:27.580 --> 02:29:29.021]  Let me just stop you, let me just stop you.
[02:29:29.141 --> 02:29:35.224]  I just figured since you were a little state senator that nobody had ever heard of until he started being pushed.
[02:29:35.664 --> 02:29:43.408]  And what's interesting is when you get to know more about his background, there were forces that were obviously helping to move him along.
[02:29:43.648 --> 02:29:47.129]  There are questions about who funded his education and all of these kinds of things.
[02:29:47.469 --> 02:29:52.732]  It looked like somebody had it in mind to prepare him for us, even though they weren't preparing us for him.
[02:29:53.769 --> 02:29:55.670]  Okay, well I apologize for my ignorance.
[02:29:55.810 --> 02:30:17.395]  I figured since you were running in Illinois, and since you knew, I mean I remember seeing you a year and a half, two years ago, speeches on YouTube, hearing you on the radio, you were so accurate about him, I was just guessing that you must have been in and around him in politics, but I guess you just had a crash course in research when you saw him being pushed and propelled by all these special interests?
[02:30:17.415 --> 02:30:22.997]  Sometimes, sometimes you can be accurate simply because you bring an objective state of mind to the past.
[02:30:23.977 --> 02:30:26.058]  And are willing to let them instruct you.
[02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:30.559]  That, I guess, is all I can claim in terms of any understanding.
[02:30:30.659 --> 02:30:31.179]  Okay, good.
[02:30:31.219 --> 02:30:37.081]  Break down then who he really is and what he would like to do if we weren't blocking him right now.
[02:30:37.421 --> 02:30:38.821]  What would Barack Obama be doing?
[02:30:38.861 --> 02:30:39.321]  Who is he?
[02:30:40.001 --> 02:30:45.503]  Well, I think Barack Obama wants to, and at the very least, to impose a Chavez-style socialism.
[02:30:46.112 --> 02:30:46.933]  We're good to go.
[02:31:03.310 --> 02:31:05.331]  And therefore, he wants to throw it out the window.
[02:31:06.392 --> 02:31:11.835]  They also seem to believe in what you might call a majority tyranny.
[02:31:12.256 --> 02:31:23.922]  So that if you win an election, you then have license to do whatever you want and no longer have to pay any attention to individual rights, to the rights of the minority group of voters that don't support the things you're doing.
[02:31:24.263 --> 02:31:25.744]  All of that overthrown.
[02:31:26.264 --> 02:31:31.307]  The patterns are patterns that we see in contemporary life with somebody like Chavez.
[02:31:31.807 --> 02:31:32.067]  I don't
[02:32:01.747 --> 02:32:23.105]  Which devalues the individual and which lifts up the notion that individuals are no different than stones or rocks or any other material things and should be arranged and ordered by the will of the ruler so that their ideas and understanding of what is right for the society can be carried out.
[02:32:23.425 --> 02:32:31.317]  The whole moral understanding that puts an intrinsic value on individuals that started with our Declaration of Independence, he also rejects.
[02:32:31.897 --> 02:32:37.025]  And once you realize that you're dealing with somebody whose moral universe
[02:32:37.988 --> 02:32:46.751]  It has rejected the fundamental premise of liberty that most Americans kind of take for granted, even when they can't fully articulate them.
[02:32:47.271 --> 02:32:50.492]  Then you are a long way toward understanding what he's about.
[02:32:50.532 --> 02:32:51.452]  And what does he want to do?
[02:32:52.073 --> 02:32:53.053]  He wants to impose.
[02:32:53.533 --> 02:32:57.756]  That kind of controlling socialist government on the United States.
[02:32:57.956 --> 02:32:59.837]  Does he think it's going to do us good?
[02:32:59.857 --> 02:33:11.964]  I imagine so, but I've got to tell you, when you see somebody so unwilling to look at the factual truth, and a lot of these leftists have been for the whole of my lifetime,
[02:33:12.664 --> 02:33:13.225]  Amazing points!
[02:33:31.886 --> 02:33:41.591]  Dealing with lying, though, you worked in the White House with Ronald Reagan, and even if you disagreed with him or loved him or hated him, Reagan didn't do a lot of lying.
[02:33:41.631 --> 02:33:43.532]  I mean, he really was honest.
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:48.902]  I mean, his policies were very transparent.
[02:33:49.503 --> 02:33:54.767]  In fact, there wasn't any lying, as much as I can tell, which is universes away from Clinton.
[02:33:55.208 --> 02:34:02.454]  Bush certainly did some deceptive things, but Obama, I mean, you've been around presidents, you've been an ambassador, you've been in these campaigns.
[02:34:02.955 --> 02:34:06.838]  Is it safe to say, or would you disagree with my perspective, that he is the
[02:34:08.211 --> 02:34:09.872]  Greatest liar I've ever seen.
[02:34:09.952 --> 02:34:11.212]  A new level of lying.
[02:34:11.252 --> 02:34:12.853]  I mean, I've read books about Hitler.
[02:34:12.933 --> 02:34:14.213]  I've read books about other people.
[02:34:14.273 --> 02:34:19.495]  It seems that Obama is really the slickest liar I've ever seen.
[02:34:20.675 --> 02:34:21.255]  I'm not sure.
[02:34:21.275 --> 02:34:35.960]  You know, I think part of the reason he appears so right now is because the mass of the American people kind of aren't used to having to assume that the person they're dealing with is, how can I put it, not just lying.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.661]  They are constructing a fiction.
[02:34:38.672 --> 02:34:39.012]  I don't
[02:34:58.382 --> 02:35:00.824]  Those people aren't really who they're pretending to be.
[02:35:00.884 --> 02:35:05.988]  Their inflections and tones do not reflect feelings they really have, and so forth and so on.
[02:35:06.528 --> 02:35:11.872]  And yet, because they're good at what they do, we accept it and are drawn into that world.
[02:35:11.913 --> 02:35:20.179]  Well, imagine that you're dealing with people for whom every aspect of public life is that kind of acted-out fiction.
[02:35:21.313 --> 02:35:34.407]  They're pursuing their objective, and they just want to get you to come in and believe the world is what it needs to be so that they can achieve their power, achieve their objective, achieve what they want to achieve.
[02:35:34.447 --> 02:35:35.347]  That's Barack Obama.
[02:35:36.048 --> 02:35:41.734]  And to say he's great is fine, but it's just that we're not used to having such thoroughgoing actors.
[02:35:42.594 --> 02:35:45.515]  With no respect for truth in American politics.
[02:35:45.815 --> 02:35:46.976]  Yeah, we're used to liars.
[02:35:47.076 --> 02:35:47.856]  People lie.
[02:35:48.356 --> 02:35:54.259]  But underlying it all, there's been this assumption that the aim, somehow, is still to respect the truth.
[02:35:54.499 --> 02:35:57.160]  That's not the case with these folks, because they don't believe it anymore.
[02:35:57.580 --> 02:36:08.865]  You know, the notion of the self-evident truths that establish our rights, that show clearly that justice somehow has a basis that isn't just based on the power of those who rule over you.
[02:36:09.145 --> 02:36:10.166]  They reject all of that.
[02:36:10.806 --> 02:36:24.990]  I think right now very striking to us because Americans kind of have had the luxury of taking it for granted that overall this is not what American life and politics was about.
[02:36:25.770 --> 02:36:28.511]  But now we're having to deal with a very real
[02:36:30.060 --> 02:36:42.727]  That this way of doing politics which overtook Europe, which overtook countries in the third world, and which radically transformed those countries into gulags and hellish places of oppression, it has now come to America.
[02:36:43.629 --> 02:36:48.071]  Wow, you know what, I rarely have epiphanies these days from guests.
[02:36:48.111 --> 02:36:52.653]  I mean, I get a lot of good points, a lot of good ideas, but you just actually shifted my perspective.
[02:36:53.454 --> 02:36:59.797]  I mean, I know it's a matrix, I know it's a facade, a Wizard of Oz lie, but the way you just explained it, you're right.
[02:37:00.217 --> 02:37:01.678]  It's that the mainstream media
[02:37:02.578 --> 02:37:13.764]  And the system is playing to his tune with such choreographed precision that it creates a whole Disneyland of lies.
[02:37:14.204 --> 02:37:20.267]  So it's not just Bill Clinton saying, I didn't have sex with that woman or lying about, you know, corruption.
[02:37:20.627 --> 02:37:22.668]  It's that the whole thing is a lie.
[02:37:23.788 --> 02:37:24.369]  Well, exactly.
[02:37:24.409 --> 02:37:30.832]  They are creating, as it were, a perceived reality that serves their purposes.
[02:37:31.477 --> 02:37:38.583]  And, of course, the ground started to be laid for this years ago when these people started that phony mantra, Perception is Reality.
[02:37:38.904 --> 02:37:40.105]  Perception is Reality.
[02:37:40.125 --> 02:37:41.105]  This is not true!
[02:37:41.366 --> 02:37:43.487]  Not if God exists, at least.
[02:37:43.507 --> 02:37:56.899]  Because there is a principle of reality that transcends human perception and understanding and is the basis for making real judgments in a rational way about what is right, what is wrong, what should or should not be done.
[02:37:57.359 --> 02:38:12.988]  They rejected that notion of having such a basis for morality, and the only standard they claim is a scientific one, but of course, remember, science cannot tell us anything about what is right and what is wrong, what is just, what is unjust.
[02:38:13.008 --> 02:38:14.249]  Science can't address that.
[02:38:15.388 --> 02:38:16.770]  Sir, we've got limited time.
[02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:24.741]  We've got about 12 minutes left and I'm even going to skip this network break so we have this time with you because I've got several other questions I want to get to and certainly have you back up in the near future.
[02:38:24.761 --> 02:38:27.404]  Very honored to have Ambassador Alan Keyes on with us today.
[02:38:27.965 --> 02:38:29.087]  Very thought-provoking.
[02:38:31.727 --> 02:38:38.472]  Especially, perception isn't reality if the person giving you the perception is putting false data in, or lying, or distorting.
[02:38:38.792 --> 02:38:50.200]  I mean, if you're wearing a headset of virtual reality goggles, and you see a flat, green field you're walking in, but really you're about to walk off a hundred-story building, you're going to fall and die.
[02:38:50.460 --> 02:38:51.982]  The goggles are lying to you.
[02:38:52.282 --> 02:38:55.224]  Perception isn't reality, but that was just me backing you up there.
[02:38:55.244 --> 02:38:56.425]  Well, think of it, think of it.
[02:38:56.485 --> 02:38:59.567]  This is exactly what they were trying to do with this healthcare business.
[02:39:00.433 --> 02:39:05.917]  Tell it on the basis that we're going to give everybody access, it's going to be better, and it's going to be less costly, and all of this.
[02:39:05.978 --> 02:39:23.592]  And then when you started to get into the detail, it wasn't actually less costly, they were just going to shift the distribution of the cost, so that the elderly citizens and so forth were going to be targeted in particular for rationing, so that those costs could be distributed differently.
[02:39:23.892 --> 02:39:28.636]  They said, well everybody's going to have access and so forth, but the burden of paying for that
[02:39:29.156 --> 02:39:32.358]  And the government's got a whole new tax to pull out of your paycheck.
[02:39:32.378 --> 02:39:32.758]  Exactly.
[02:39:53.936 --> 02:39:54.256]  Exactly.
[02:39:54.276 --> 02:39:55.337]  We've got 10 minutes left here.
[02:39:55.357 --> 02:39:56.679]  I want to ask you quick questions now.
[02:39:57.580 --> 02:40:02.905]  Eugenics, from my research ambassador, is the foundation of these control freaks.
[02:40:02.945 --> 02:40:07.930]  They believe we're all just blobs of protoplasm, so why not get rid of 80% of us?
[02:40:08.010 --> 02:40:12.295]  United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 96, State Department memorandum 200, Eric Holder,
[02:40:17.102 --> 02:40:36.167]  All these other people, John P. Holdren, John P. Holdren, Ecoscience, Population, Resources, Environment, calls for forced drugging the water to sterilize us, forced abortion, CPS taking basically all children, raising them in government hives, and I have all these other government textbooks, and you're a learned person, you're aware of this,
[02:40:36.827 --> 02:41:06.174]  uh... exposing the whole abortion agenda which is only one level and then he he unfreezes the money for forced abortion and uh... you know they say oh you'll get the welfare in africa but we've got a sterilize you can you speak to john p holdren and the whole eugenics situation and and what margaret sanger and the whole abortion industry really is but that is one of those things that uh... what what they have been one of the reasons i i i have been so uh... clear
[02:41:06.824 --> 02:41:10.986]  About his absolute, adamant commitment to this whole abortion thing.
[02:41:11.006 --> 02:41:17.249]  So that he carried it as far as saying that babies born alive should be allowed to die because their mothers wanted them aborted.
[02:41:18.170 --> 02:41:20.632]  That is a reflection of what you're talking about.
[02:41:21.272 --> 02:41:28.256]  Sometimes people think this is just about the specific, particular murder of that baby that abortion itself involves.
[02:41:28.316 --> 02:41:28.616]  No!
[02:41:29.117 --> 02:41:30.137]  You look at Margaret Sanger.
[02:41:30.157 --> 02:41:36.501]  That woman was about a strategy based on eugenics for basically cleansing the world of the inferior people.
[02:41:37.221 --> 02:41:49.584]  It is an inherently elitist understanding that sees no value or intrinsic worth except in those lives that stand up to the measuring rod of these elitists as somehow valuable to humankind.
[02:41:50.184 --> 02:41:57.906]  In one respect, it turns out that as the left-wingers move down this road, they are implementing a dehumanizing understanding.
[02:41:58.246 --> 02:42:13.673]  But instead of dehumanizing people based on the racist notions of somebody like Hitler and the things that were being portrayed in Germany, they dehumanize people based on the scientific understanding that there's nothing essentially human about us.
[02:42:13.813 --> 02:42:20.676]  That we are, in that sense, just blobs of flesh and chemicals and junk that can be manipulated like any other physical thing.
[02:42:21.196 --> 02:42:25.338]  And that, of course, means that there's no boundaries whatsoever that you have to respect
[02:42:25.658 --> 02:42:32.887]  Except the whimsical boundaries of personal attachment, so that if you're part of the favored clique, you might be treated differently.
[02:42:33.107 --> 02:42:34.930]  That's the world they're pushing us for!
[02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:43.961]  And abortion was essentially the cutting edge to get people implicated in a moral understanding that's destroyed our sense.
[02:42:44.201 --> 02:42:59.495]  That humanity and every single human being have a moral worth that must be respected by the power of government, that can't be disregarded on the basis of some elitist measuring rods of who's worth having around and who can be killed with impunity.
[02:43:01.936 --> 02:43:16.424]  Ambassador, isn't this really the religion of control freaks on power trips where Peter Singer says let parents kill their babies for a year after they're born, get rid of the old people, they've got the same value as mackerel?
[02:43:16.924 --> 02:43:28.370]  I mean, these are quotes saying an old person has the same value as a fish, that a retarded child needs to be killed, and I found they really are the ultimate racist as
[02:43:29.290 --> 02:43:32.893]  As Margaret Sanger wrote in her own letters to D.B.
[02:43:32.913 --> 02:43:39.539]  Du Bois, she said, I've got to hire black men to be my fronts to get rid of these black weeds.
[02:43:39.959 --> 02:43:48.686]  In my research, I found that the real racists, the real Nazis, always cloak themselves as liberals, and that it's even more than that.
[02:43:48.746 --> 02:43:51.929]  It's not just some pseudoscience and their excuse to play God.
[02:43:52.429 --> 02:44:06.229]  That they ravenously enjoy going after Asians, Africans, Latin Americans, poor people, it doesn't matter, and that they even have people of color in their ranks who enjoy this!
[02:44:07.435 --> 02:44:25.614]  Well, you know, the sad thing is, underlying it all, there is an element of what I call self-worship involved in this, that is involved in the fascination these elites have for themselves and their own power, and the confirmation they see when they enjoy a little success that comes out better than everybody else.
[02:44:26.274 --> 02:44:41.458]  That even, by the way, accounts for their so-called compassion, because it affirms their superiority to see themselves from a height helping the downtrodden who, because of their inferiority, couldn't do as well, and so forth and so on.
[02:44:41.558 --> 02:44:45.559]  But remember, that kind of self-worship has an implication.
[02:44:46.439 --> 02:45:00.810]  That goes to the very heart of religion and faith and spirituality, because it denies that there is anything other than themselves that is worthy of that kind of real reverence.
[02:45:00.890 --> 02:45:06.754]  And so, it is premised at the end of the day on the banishing of God from the consciousness of human beings.
[02:45:07.374 --> 02:45:15.460]  And that's why people like myself who put a great stress on the American Declaration, on the fact that our unalienable rights come from the hand of Almighty God,
[02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:18.742]  We are their deep enemy.
[02:45:18.862 --> 02:45:27.448]  Because we will not let people forget the existence of God and the fact that most of us accept that and believe it.
[02:45:27.947 --> 02:45:44.633]  Well, Ambassador, when you read, as I know you have, all these futurists and transhumanists and neo-eugenicists that just fill the government ranks, Dr. Piankas and the Holdrens and Ehrlichs, they actually believe they're God.
[02:45:44.733 --> 02:45:53.997]  In the BBC, there was a report last year where they said, we're going to split off and be an elite species of the government planner, and then all the rest of you are these sub-humans.
[02:45:54.037 --> 02:45:54.677]  I mean, you're right.
[02:45:55.177 --> 02:45:59.479]  But it's not just that they don't want to say God doesn't exist, they're saying, I am God.
[02:46:00.159 --> 02:46:06.403]  Well, you see, but I think that's a return to something quite old in terms of human injustice.
[02:46:06.563 --> 02:46:21.470]  Remember that when the people of the world were subjected to these old oligarchic aristocratic regimes, you know, the nobles and the peasantry and all of this, the myths of the time were centered on apotheosis.
[02:46:22.054 --> 02:46:26.988]  That is, we're the elite because of their success and achievements and greatness.
[02:46:27.566 --> 02:46:29.668]  They are elevated to the status of God.
[02:46:29.828 --> 02:46:31.129]  That happened to the Caesars.
[02:46:31.530 --> 02:46:32.510]  That happened to others.
[02:46:32.811 --> 02:46:39.937]  The aim, therefore, in that pagan understanding was for these people to transform themselves to God-like status.
[02:46:40.017 --> 02:46:55.030]  And all we're seeing is a return of that age-old shibboleth now being used once again to impose the idea of some kind of inherent superiority of these elites upon people whom they intend en masse to oppress.
[02:46:55.521 --> 02:46:55.981]  Amazing.
[02:46:56.061 --> 02:46:58.082]  Ambassador, we've got to have you back up on this subject.
[02:46:58.483 --> 02:46:59.263]  Last question.
[02:47:00.243 --> 02:47:02.665]  Governors oppose DOD emergency powers.
[02:47:03.065 --> 02:47:05.026]  That's from The Hill, newspaper in D.C.
[02:47:05.066 --> 02:47:05.506]  as you know.
[02:47:06.447 --> 02:47:09.368]  Congressman could use pandemic to declare martial law.
[02:47:09.448 --> 02:47:11.169]  Congressman told the Louisville Journal.
[02:47:11.509 --> 02:47:18.093]  Congressman Paul Brown said they may use it to declare martial law as a cover for Obama because his agenda.
[02:47:19.053 --> 02:47:22.935]  Pentagon wants authority to post 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[02:47:23.535 --> 02:47:23.876]  I mean,
[02:47:24.776 --> 02:47:41.141]  This is unbelievable, and we now hear Obama saying terrorists, right-wing terrorists, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the DOD documents, and the Justice Department, Homeland Security, veterans and gun owners, and Ron Paul supporters are terrorists.
[02:47:41.761 --> 02:47:48.503]  In the last two minutes, can you comment on that, and are you concerned that Obama may stage crises, as Michael Savage and others have said?
[02:47:49.343 --> 02:47:57.951]  Well, I think we're seeing, again, a reliable pattern that was there in the 20th century versions of this imposition of communism.
[02:47:57.991 --> 02:48:01.834]  The blurring of the distinction between the military and law enforcement.
[02:48:01.934 --> 02:48:06.799]  The destruction of the idea that human beings have individual rights.
[02:48:06.899 --> 02:48:14.706]  Instead, there's some national security threat that overrides those rights and justifies making use of any kind of
[02:48:15.066 --> 02:48:15.867]  We're good to go.
[02:48:38.621 --> 02:48:44.104]  Which they blamed on the communists and leftists and those who were opposing what Hitler was trying to do.
[02:48:44.405 --> 02:48:47.526]  And what we now know from the historical record, they did it themselves.
[02:48:48.027 --> 02:48:58.513]  They burned down the Reichstag in order to provoke the excuse that allowed them to impose that totalitarian control and consolidate it completely over Germany.
[02:48:59.173 --> 02:49:03.016]  I think that we're watching a repetition of this pattern and we need to wake up!
[02:49:03.624 --> 02:49:09.329]  And we need to use those tools we still have available as Americans to stop this from happening.
[02:49:10.269 --> 02:49:10.750]  Amazing.
[02:49:10.850 --> 02:49:13.792]  Ambassador Alan Keyes, I look forward to having you back up.
[02:49:13.812 --> 02:49:17.916]  The website is loyaltoliberty.blogspot.com.
[02:49:17.956 --> 02:49:18.977]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:49:19.777 --> 02:49:20.518]  Glad to be with you.
[02:49:20.538 --> 02:49:21.198]  Thanks for having me.
[02:49:21.238 --> 02:49:21.639]  Thank you, sir.
[02:49:21.679 --> 02:49:23.360]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:49:29.517 --> 02:49:34.503]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:49:34.723 --> 02:49:38.527]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:49:38.747 --> 02:49:44.334]  Number two, our new Energy Czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:49:44.654 --> 02:49:45.095]  It's true.
[02:49:45.295 --> 02:49:50.240]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:56.085]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:49:56.946 --> 02:49:59.589]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:49:59.829 --> 02:50:04.053]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:50:04.353 --> 02:50:07.957]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:50:08.197 --> 02:50:13.679]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
