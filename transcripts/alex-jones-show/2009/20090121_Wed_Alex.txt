[00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.092]  We are live, one hour and eight and a half minutes into this live transmission.
[00:00:08.132 --> 00:00:13.934]  We have begun simulcasting
[00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:30.841]  At PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:38.623]  So you can go there right now if you're a PrisonPlanet.TV member and watch the show live with all the documents, news clip and material.
[00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:48.505]  We're going to be analyzing Barack Obama's speech that he gave where he laid out his agenda and decode what it really means and then go through the evidence of all of that.
[00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:49.525]  It's about an 18 minute speech.
[00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:51.225]  It will probably take most of the hour for me to go through this.
[00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:56.086]  Then we're going to have open phones coming up at the end of the hour into the hour after that.
[00:00:57.046 --> 00:01:05.894]  So that is coming up as we break this down, this incredible betrayal of all these well-meaning people that rejected the wicked Bush administration agenda.
[00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:14.862]  And now I've been driven right into the arms of the New World Order 2.0, president of the world, savior of the world, the newly coronated king.
[00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:16.809]  Barack Obama.
[00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:25.631]  Talk about an archetypal image of the little man behind the curtain, literally collapsing on the final day that his evil life's work is nearing its completion.
[00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:28.271]  Vice President Dick Cheney in that wheelchair.
[00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:35.973]  That's why you don't see him for months at a time, because the guy's had, what, six heart attacks when he's not out and hunting accidents, shooting people in the face.
[00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:40.714]  Then they're, I apologize, you shot me in the face, Mr. Vice President.
[00:01:40.774 --> 00:01:42.694]  So, Bush being booed,
[00:01:44.013 --> 00:01:56.397]  Cheney being booed, the people in just incredible euphoria worshipping Obama, that's exactly what the establishment wants.
[00:01:56.737 --> 00:02:03.139]  They bring Bush in, they stage the terror attacks, they build him up as a god, he gets a 92% approval rating, highest in U.S.
[00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.580]  history since they've been doing polls in the last century.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.341]  For over a hundred years.
[00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:13.646]  And then his approval rating goes down, all the torture, the secret arrest, the police state being geared up for the American people.
[00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:18.790]  He gets the blame for all that when it was just the New Order agenda continuing with him as a front man.
[00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.592]  And then in comes Obama.
[00:02:21.636 --> 00:02:30.725]  And if you notice during his speech, some of the key things he does is that he'll talk about, we're going to fix the economy, we're going to help you, we're going to bring change, we're going to bring brotherhood, you know, we're going to feed the homeless.
[00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:31.466]  All sounds great.
[00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:35.109]  And then he says, we're going to track down the terrorists everywhere and keep you safe.
[00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.971]  We're going to smoke them out of their holes.
[00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:38.372]  Everybody's like, yeah!
[00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:40.454]  And then Obama leans back and smiles.
[00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:41.655]  He's like, I've got these people.
[00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:46.225]  All the stuff Bush did, suddenly the Democrats are like, well, maybe we need a draft.
[00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:47.909]  Well, maybe we need to stay in Iraq.
[00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:51.598]  Well, maybe we need to keep, you know, the spying on the American people without warrants.
[00:02:53.237 --> 00:02:56.239]  All of that in place, all of that being expanded.
[00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.600]  You guys earlier were showing me some of those pictures.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.104]  Yeah, put those up on screen, that particular one of Dick Cheney in the wheelchair.
[00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:06.985]  I want folks to get a look at that.
[00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:11.548]  I mean, talk about a life of evil, a life of murder, a life of corruption, a life of power.
[00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:14.629]  And then look at him, nearing the end of his life.
[00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:18.452]  I would guess he doesn't live more than five, six more years, statistically.
[00:03:19.472 --> 00:03:21.032]  And he just is an empty husk.
[00:03:21.612 --> 00:03:32.895]  I was watching him on television yesterday, just like... You know, he looked like Rehnquist, who administered Bush's last oath and died a few months later of cancer.
[00:03:33.415 --> 00:03:35.155]  And I said, Rehnquist doesn't have long to go.
[00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:37.796]  And let me tell you, Cheney looks like he's on death's doorstep.
[00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:40.796]  But then sometimes he's all animated and jacked up again.
[00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:45.077]  Oh, by the way, we've always covered on air, just a segue,
[00:03:46.707 --> 00:03:54.291]  The fact that presidents going back to at least Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the thirties had doubles.
[00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:56.692]  We know Woodrow Wilson had doubles.
[00:03:57.793 --> 00:04:01.955]  And every time I talk about that, people email me, they call me, they laugh at me.
[00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:16.022]  Well, it was in the London Telegraph yesterday that Barack Obama does have body doubles and that there were body doubles all over the event, basically, yesterday.
[00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.222]  And I've seen this before with Clinton when he would come to Austin.
[00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:25.805]  They would have a body double because I've been there on the side of the highway and I'm like, that doesn't look exactly like Clinton.
[00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:31.569]  And then you learn later that a delivery truck pulled up at the event and that's what Bill Clinton got out of.
[00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:33.310]  But it would never be on the news it was a double.
[00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.392]  I'd come on air and say, I'm pretty sure I saw a Clinton double today.
[00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:43.738]  But I had that story here in my stack, but I've got so many
[00:04:45.478 --> 00:05:13.320]  hundreds of articles just google uh... guys in there because I can't find it in my stack barack obama body double it's a london telegraph and just put that up on screen for folks instead of me just oh here it is I found it here it is london telegraph barack obama inauguration security team could use presidential doubles and they go on to admit that presidents have used doubles that he does have doubles the doubles were there but
[00:05:14.286 --> 00:05:15.786]  It kind of leaves it open and nebulous.
[00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:17.527]  So there you have it.
[00:05:18.247 --> 00:05:20.727]  There is the London Telegraph headline.
[00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:23.488]  So many things we talk about, people laugh about.
[00:05:23.868 --> 00:05:24.888]  This is not a joke.
[00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:27.889]  This is all part of how staged things are.
[00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.409]  Okay.
[00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:39.051]  I'm going to go ahead in a minute or two, start getting into Barack Obama.
[00:05:40.564 --> 00:05:52.770]  and the things he's up to and what his agenda is going to be from his speech and then decoding how he makes it all sound like the best things in sliced bread or apple pie and it's not.
[00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:02.675]  Before I do that, I put the call out to listeners yesterday to support us
[00:06:03.973 --> 00:06:06.914]  By buying the books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:18.779]  The books and videos I've made, written, and the books and videos that we carry by other great researchers like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, the Barry Cooper's Never Get Busted Again, by the way he's in studio in the last hour today.
[00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.000]  He's put out two films.

[00:07:52.482 --> 00:07:53.883]  So I want to thank all of you out there.
[00:07:54.664 --> 00:07:59.226]  Okay, I've been kind of procrastinating getting into this because it's a monumental job.
[00:07:59.306 --> 00:08:12.174]  I re-watched his speech last night and again this morning and wrote several pages of notes, but let's just get started here with Barack Obama with two million people in attendance, the biggest presidential inaugural ever,
[00:08:13.646 --> 00:08:17.329]  Booing Bush as the old New World Order puppet is removed.
[00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:20.212]  The old birdcage liner is removed.
[00:08:20.252 --> 00:08:25.196]  It's covered with seeds and stuff the bird dropped and bird crap and all of that.
[00:08:26.057 --> 00:08:32.682]  And instead of focusing on the bird, the New World Order that's doing all of this to us, we focus on the birdcage liner.
[00:08:33.123 --> 00:08:36.546]  The media tells you the President is the boss and actually runs something.
[00:08:37.378 --> 00:08:42.080]  Okay, when the military-industrial complex has overthrown everything, through Northcom, and that's owned by the private banks.
[00:08:43.261 --> 00:08:46.502]  And the Army War College admits this, and the head of the Naval War College admits it.
[00:08:47.843 --> 00:08:57.148]  So, they are now putting in the fresh birdcage liner, and then building up the birdcage liner as he's going to fix it, he's going to save you, just go along with his agenda.
[00:08:58.008 --> 00:09:01.610]  That is the bird basically tripling the amount of poop it drops on us.
[00:09:02.802 --> 00:09:03.863]  Okay, so there's your analogy.
[00:09:04.183 --> 00:09:12.567]  They're removing Bush, he's being booed at the ceremony, ha ha ha, and then the new birdcage liner, it's beautiful, there's not a single spot on it, they slide it in.
[00:09:12.627 --> 00:09:18.990]  But Obama has told us what the bird, Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller, the Rothschilds, sitting above the birdcage is going to do.
[00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:22.972]  And it isn't pretty.
[00:09:23.052 --> 00:09:25.533]  So let's look at what's in this bird's belly.
[00:09:27.188 --> 00:09:38.355]  Right now, ladies and gentlemen, let's look at the innards, let's look at the guts of this situation right now from a Barack Obama, and I will be playing this and stopping it throughout for the rest of the hour and commenting.
[00:09:38.395 --> 00:09:38.775]  Here we go.
[00:09:39.856 --> 00:09:51.803]  My fellow citizens, I stand here today humbled by the task before us.
[00:09:54.044 --> 00:09:56.466]  Grateful for the trust you've bestowed
[00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:01.884]  Mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors.
[00:10:02.284 --> 00:10:02.904]  Alright, stop there.
[00:10:05.944 --> 00:10:06.304]  Okay.
[00:10:09.505 --> 00:10:11.045]  Mindful of your sacrifices.
[00:10:11.065 --> 00:10:12.625]  You know, we're sacrificing.
[00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:13.606]  We're together.
[00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:15.006]  We're one group.
[00:10:15.146 --> 00:10:16.126]  I care about you.
[00:10:16.506 --> 00:10:25.288]  And it's a double meaning, specifically to black folks, the suffering of our ancestors, but to the general public it looks like it's an inclusive comment.
[00:10:26.128 --> 00:10:27.088]  So he's dividing
[00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:39.250]  And saying this is a black thing, meanwhile he increases the abortions for black babies, while giving a public announcement that he is bringing unification.
[00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:40.811]  Just everything is deception.
[00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:42.411]  All carefully crafted, every word.
[00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:45.672]  Of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors.
[00:10:48.112 --> 00:10:50.673]  I thank President Bush for his service to our nation.
[00:10:52.808 --> 00:10:55.349]  I thank President Bush for his service.
[00:10:55.389 --> 00:11:12.978]  So after seeing how horrible Bush is, how criminal, how bad, suddenly, oh, he's so great, he's given us a great transition, he's worked so hard, and you've got all these Republican leaders, and Pat Robertson loving him and saying, I'm surprised, I like him, he's going to attack all these countries, you've got to get behind him, socialism will save America, it's inevitable.
[00:11:13.698 --> 00:11:15.840]  So, again, unifying everybody.
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:22.846]  They're kind of going past the left-right paradigm right now, into just, we're going into a depression, which his boss has engineered, but they're not saying that.
[00:11:23.406 --> 00:11:25.228]  I will save you if you just do what I say.
[00:11:26.589 --> 00:11:34.936]  As well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
[00:11:38.599 --> 00:11:41.902]  44 Americans have now taken the presidential oath.
[00:11:43.885 --> 00:11:49.269]  The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace.
[00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:56.455]  All right, now he's calling upon history, ancestry, you know, the American tradition.
[00:11:56.575 --> 00:12:01.099]  When in reality, he's going to destroy fully what's left of the American tradition.
[00:12:02.034 --> 00:12:05.195]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:12:05.555 --> 00:12:07.296]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:12.817]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.

[00:12:52.874 --> 00:12:57.676]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:16.346]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:13:16.706 --> 00:13:24.572]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:13:24.873 --> 00:13:29.637]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:34.601]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:13:35.177 --> 00:13:39.019]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.

[00:16:06.903 --> 00:16:11.566]  Over a hundred years of New World Order preparation by the banking elite based out of England.
[00:16:11.967 --> 00:16:17.571]  The takeover through the Council on Foreign Relations and the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 and 1922.
[00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:24.075]  The War Powers Act in 1933, setting up the state police under covert federal charters.
[00:16:25.196 --> 00:16:35.304]  The staged terror attacks, the phony war on drugs, all to build a giant apparatus of tyranny and to train American school children to be frisked and searched and drug tested, to be prisoners.
[00:16:36.485 --> 00:16:41.309]  This is the New World Order and we are now deep, deep into it.
[00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:42.370]  We are analyzing...
[00:16:44.815 --> 00:16:55.358]  The key speech that Barack Obama gave yesterday, seconds after being sworn in as the 44th President.
[00:16:56.178 --> 00:17:07.702]  After the insults of Bush stealing two elections, after all the corruption the Savior has presented, right as the economic collapse begins, right as the public are told about a collapse begun decades ago,
[00:17:08.502 --> 00:17:14.545]  He will save you, as his entire administration of the very people that engineered the very collapse.
[00:17:16.506 --> 00:17:18.007]  There are none of you that can deny it.
[00:17:19.088 --> 00:17:23.150]  Let's go ahead and go back to Barack Obama as I analyze his speech.
[00:17:26.191 --> 00:17:33.195]  Yet, every so often, the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.
[00:17:35.546 --> 00:17:49.153]  At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we, the people, have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears.
[00:17:50.193 --> 00:17:51.374]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:17:51.854 --> 00:17:53.274]  This is classic.
[00:17:53.915 --> 00:17:54.775]  This is classic.
[00:17:55.516 --> 00:17:56.156]  He's saying
[00:17:58.237 --> 00:18:02.660]  Forty-four presidents, the honor, the history, everything we've been through, the good times, the bad.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.702]  But we have gathering clouds.
[00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:06.683]  I need you to help me.
[00:18:07.904 --> 00:18:09.345]  Again, that classic call to the people.
[00:18:09.385 --> 00:18:13.848]  This is a wholesome good thing, if you didn't know the evil agenda and the incredible betrayal.
[00:18:14.288 --> 00:18:15.049]  I need your help.
[00:18:15.249 --> 00:18:22.834]  I need you to join my core, separate from government, with usaservice.org, private, under their control, with governmental
[00:18:24.022 --> 00:18:29.868]  The packaging, with a separate governmental army under government control, a one million man force they're building.
[00:18:31.462 --> 00:18:32.422]  So see, it sounds reasonable.
[00:18:32.622 --> 00:18:33.663]  We have gathering clouds.
[00:18:33.783 --> 00:18:34.743]  I need you to help me.
[00:18:35.183 --> 00:18:41.305]  Psychologically, people then feel like they're part of the process, fully invested, that they're working with the government to fix it.
[00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:48.947]  And that creates the false mental image that the government is good and is trying to fix things and the government is the people.
[00:18:49.147 --> 00:18:58.250]  When the government has been the people in the past to a certain extent, but they are actually removing the government from the people's control under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, under PDD 51,
[00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:06.636]  Under this incredible centralization that we're seeing, which Obama says he's going to continue and expand.
[00:19:07.076 --> 00:19:07.937]  So see, that's a deception.
[00:19:07.957 --> 00:19:10.280]  And then he comes in with the big one.
[00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:19.269]  He says, our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, our form of government, our liberty.
[00:19:19.329 --> 00:19:20.430]  So that's what America is.
[00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.732]  People are like, yes, yes, yes!
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.900]  But he's coming to destroy all those forms.
[00:19:26.681 --> 00:19:34.502]  His agenda is to remove those into centralized power and expand the federal government with regulations and control and carbon taxes.
[00:19:34.942 --> 00:19:35.582]  Here, back it up.
[00:19:35.622 --> 00:19:36.142]  Listen to this.
[00:19:38.363 --> 00:19:39.063]  This transition.
[00:19:42.744 --> 00:19:46.144]  44 Americans have now taken the presidential oath.
[00:19:48.045 --> 00:19:53.406]  The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace.
[00:19:55.612 --> 00:20:02.636]  Yet, every so often, the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.
[00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:21.308]  At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we, the people, have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers and true to our founding documents.
[00:20:23.129 --> 00:20:23.369]  Okay.
[00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:25.460]  We're in a crisis.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.300]  We're in trouble.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.542]  I need you to help me save our founding documents.
[00:20:29.742 --> 00:20:31.063]  I need you to save America.
[00:20:31.103 --> 00:20:33.044]  It's been you that saved America in the past.
[00:20:33.864 --> 00:20:34.825]  I'm Barack Obama.
[00:20:34.985 --> 00:20:36.006]  I want to save America.
[00:20:36.066 --> 00:20:36.566]  Work with me.
[00:20:36.606 --> 00:20:37.827]  That means do what I say.
[00:20:37.887 --> 00:20:38.827]  Go along with our agenda.
[00:20:39.788 --> 00:20:42.269]  Which from A to Z is to hand over our sovereignty.
[00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:43.730]  Attack other nations.
[00:20:44.131 --> 00:20:45.491]  Have a domestic police state.
[00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:52.816]  I mean, do you see what he's saying while they are butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[00:20:53.717 --> 00:20:54.877]  But paying lip service to it?
[00:20:56.538 --> 00:20:57.278]  So it has been.
[00:20:58.618 --> 00:21:01.459]  So it must be with this generation of Americans.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.540]  That we are in the midst of crisis.
[00:21:06.441 --> 00:21:09.181]  Again, he's saying we're going to always be like we were before, the freedom.
[00:21:09.741 --> 00:21:11.302]  So it was, so it must be.
[00:21:11.462 --> 00:21:13.743]  When in reality, see it was all about change.
[00:21:13.783 --> 00:21:22.265]  Now he's saying America, dedication, honor, our history, our sacred conventions and canons.
[00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:25.429]  And then he's... I mean, just wait.
[00:21:25.469 --> 00:21:26.770]  It just gets more and more incredible.
[00:21:27.771 --> 00:21:30.134]  But again, one of the best written speeches ever.
[00:21:30.194 --> 00:21:30.734]  He didn't write it.
[00:21:31.595 --> 00:21:34.498]  He's there reading off a teleprompter, but delivering it with great aplomb.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:36.600]  Very well done.
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.323]  We're going to come back in a long segment and get to most of this.
[00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:43.668]  Just devastating to freedom.
[00:21:44.468 --> 00:21:46.751]  Posing that he's trying to save America while he's destroying it.
[00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:53.501]  We're on the march.
[00:21:53.761 --> 00:21:55.362]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:56.282 --> 00:21:59.083]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:03.165 --> 00:22:04.405]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[00:22:04.685 --> 00:22:05.865]  eFoods does it again.
[00:22:06.066 --> 00:22:10.847]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[00:22:11.167 --> 00:22:15.469]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:23.300]  I think?
[00:22:44.258 --> 00:22:48.301]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:22:48.382 --> 00:22:49.863]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:23:11.539 --> 00:23:12.580]  But who is the enemy?
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:13.600]  Bin Laden.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.881]  This is his M.O.
[00:23:14.901 --> 00:23:16.241]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:23:16.261 --> 00:23:17.902]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:23:18.242 --> 00:23:25.006]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:23:25.386 --> 00:23:25.826]  Some U.S.
[00:23:25.866 --> 00:23:31.509]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:23:32.229 --> 00:23:35.710]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.711]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:24:02.327 --> 00:24:02.867]  You worry.
[00:24:03.228 --> 00:24:04.949]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:07.530]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.732]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:24:10.072 --> 00:24:11.272]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:24:11.673 --> 00:24:14.875]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:24:15.275 --> 00:24:20.138]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:24:20.498 --> 00:24:23.840]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.821]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:24:26.161 --> 00:24:28.763]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:24:29.083 --> 00:24:32.005]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:24:32.509 --> 00:24:40.691]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:24:41.151 --> 00:24:45.553]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:24:54.015 --> 00:24:55.375]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:24:55.395 --> 00:24:57.116]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:25:05.313 --> 00:25:24.966]  Okay, let's go right back into the live transmission here, ladies and gentlemen, with our analysis of what Barack Obama was really saying in his speech, trying to sucker the people in, do whatever I say, we're together, I want to save America, you want to save America, while he hands everything over to the private bankers that have engineered the major crises.
[00:25:26.827 --> 00:25:27.868]  It is now well understood.
[00:25:27.888 --> 00:25:34.032]  Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
[00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:37.060]  Our economy is badly weakened.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:44.064]  Okay, so he ties the economy being trouble to being at war with this far-reaching enemy.
[00:25:44.204 --> 00:25:46.206]  Then later he goes into how they're going to smoke them out of their holes.
[00:25:47.273 --> 00:25:57.201]  So, right back to the Cold War, right back to the anti-terror, we're fighting the secret brotherhood of Emanuel Goldstein, 1984, the guy with the turban and the big beard.
[00:25:57.521 --> 00:26:00.043]  And he ties that all in then, next to the economy.
[00:26:00.363 --> 00:26:02.405]  Like, we're fighting terrorists and we gotta fix our economy.
[00:26:02.445 --> 00:26:03.425]  See, that's psychology.
[00:26:03.746 --> 00:26:05.147]  They're nexusing the two together.
[00:26:08.449 --> 00:26:10.531]  ...network of violence and hatred.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:21.046]  Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices.
[00:26:21.907 --> 00:26:22.487]  Oh, oh!
[00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:25.309]  Because of the greed of some.
[00:26:25.349 --> 00:26:38.359]  We have an article up there on InfoWars.com right now, detailing that Geithner, his pick for Treasury Secretary, who doesn't pay his taxes to the private banks that he works for,
[00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:42.801]  Was involved in all the major brokerage scams.
[00:26:43.341 --> 00:26:53.148]  They ran the scams and then now they're quote, bailed out with your money but won't say where the money's going and say, we need another big bailout now to free up credit to you the American people.
[00:26:53.668 --> 00:26:58.351]  Which all that will do is then accelerate inflation.
[00:26:58.371 --> 00:27:00.793]  But if we're going to have inflation, why just have it to give it to the bankers?
[00:27:01.053 --> 00:27:02.194]  We should might as well, you know,
[00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:04.955]  ...have some benefit from it.
[00:27:04.995 --> 00:27:05.876]  It's still going to be bad.
[00:27:06.176 --> 00:27:07.296]  But it's much worse this way.
[00:27:07.356 --> 00:27:08.217]  So listen.
[00:27:08.777 --> 00:27:20.101]  Oh, the irresponsibility of some, namely everybody coming into my administration, and the fact that he got four times the overall contributions from Wall Street and from some of the big firms five times, like Goldman Sachs, than McCain got.
[00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:21.841]  And I'm not saying vote for McCain.
[00:27:22.101 --> 00:27:26.483]  The enemy owned both horses in the race, both fighters, like a Don King boxing match.
[00:27:27.619 --> 00:27:43.065]  But the one they wanted was Obama, because as Kissinger said, he has got this messianic persona, very charismatic, so he can sell the New World Order worldwide.
[00:27:43.345 --> 00:27:50.227]  Which is, I mean, he's saying it on TV, and the FBI training manual will say you're a terrorist if you say that the New World Order exists.
[00:27:50.567 --> 00:27:52.408]  But he's on CNBC saying it, and they're all saying it.
[00:27:54.346 --> 00:28:01.011]  So see, he's saying one thing, but all his pundits, the people running him, they're arrogantly saying, this is a great opportunity for us, we're going to bring in the New World Order.
[00:28:01.271 --> 00:28:02.592]  So back that up, listen to that.
[00:28:03.493 --> 00:28:09.117]  Oh, irresponsibility of the bankers, of some in high places, but all of us collectively.
[00:28:10.768 --> 00:28:12.729]  And again, any good lie has truth in it.
[00:28:12.749 --> 00:28:29.676]  It's true, we've been lazy, we've been stupid, we've been disconnected, we were dumb and let people give us credit cards and we didn't have a capacity to pay it back, but they did that because it was all fiat currency they began with, and they took those debt instruments and they sold the car debt and the credit card debt and the house debt to other investors as if it was a value as good as gold.
[00:28:31.516 --> 00:28:34.898]  So see, they made the credit card debt up out of nothing that we the taxpayer back up.
[00:28:35.358 --> 00:28:35.938]  Did you know that?
[00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:39.219]  And then they buy up everything with it.
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.180]  It's just so sick.
[00:28:42.432 --> 00:28:43.193]  We're good to go.
[00:28:55.182 --> 00:28:55.642]  Wait a minute!
[00:28:56.123 --> 00:29:15.158]  The globalists promised us that globalism, NAFTA, GATT, letting countries have huge tariffs on us, but we couldn't have tariffs on them, that's the so-called free trade, where they have no environmental standards, nothing in China and India and Mexico, and in slave wages, so it's not an equal playing field, so there's no way all the industry wouldn't leave.
[00:29:15.498 --> 00:29:20.282]  The globalists state in their own documents that was to get full control of our economy, so when they did implode it,
[00:29:21.812 --> 00:29:26.374]  That no one would have a way to protect themselves and everybody would fall under the control of the super state.
[00:29:28.314 --> 00:29:32.156]  So see, because of the greed of a few in our collective, you know, badness.
[00:29:32.276 --> 00:29:34.417]  No, the people in every major poll were against NAFTA and GATT.
[00:29:34.617 --> 00:29:35.737]  And they're against the SPP.
[00:29:36.237 --> 00:29:41.399]  That he's now saying he's going to expand the North American Union when he said eight months ago he was going to stop it.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.981]  And then remember his handler in Canada's speech said, don't worry, that's all rhetoric.
[00:29:46.261 --> 00:29:50.923]  And now Obama, last week, went on Stephanopoulos' show and said, yeah, it's just rhetoric.
[00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.791]  I mean, there's so many lies here.
[00:29:54.831 --> 00:29:55.932]  How am I ever going to play all this?
[00:29:56.593 --> 00:29:57.994]  It's just everything is deception.
[00:29:58.074 --> 00:30:00.256]  Everything is fraud coming out of this guy.
[00:30:02.899 --> 00:30:05.261]  So, oh, some bad people did this and you did this.
[00:30:05.321 --> 00:30:06.522]  We're all collectively bad.
[00:30:06.542 --> 00:30:07.843]  See, we're all together.
[00:30:07.903 --> 00:30:08.964]  You've got to do what we say.
[00:30:09.545 --> 00:30:10.505]  We're all guilty.
[00:30:10.586 --> 00:30:11.727]  No, we're not all guilty.
[00:30:16.771 --> 00:30:19.574]  So he says, our economy's in trouble because of a few bad decisions.
[00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:21.766]  No, it wasn't decisions.
[00:30:21.826 --> 00:30:22.747]  It was done on purpose.
[00:30:22.767 --> 00:30:23.747]  This is globalization.
[00:30:23.948 --> 00:30:27.971]  This is blowout economies with shock therapy, as the IMF says, to consolidate them.
[00:30:29.292 --> 00:30:33.295]  And prepare the nation for a new age.
[00:30:33.616 --> 00:30:35.077]  You want some New World Order talk?
[00:30:36.198 --> 00:30:37.319]  We've had this big crisis.
[00:30:37.359 --> 00:30:38.780]  We're having this economic problem.
[00:30:39.801 --> 00:30:41.642]  It isn't caused because of globalization by design.
[00:30:41.662 --> 00:30:43.264]  It's because we're all bad as Americans.
[00:30:43.904 --> 00:30:44.445]  But don't worry.
[00:30:44.525 --> 00:30:46.786]  I'm going to prepare you for a new age.
[00:30:47.727 --> 00:30:48.208]  Listen to that.
[00:30:49.048 --> 00:30:49.669]  Listen to that again.
[00:30:51.817 --> 00:30:53.977]  Network of violence and hatred.
[00:30:55.258 --> 00:31:07.240]  Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.240]  Did you hear that?
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:19.802]  So again, the very banks that represent him, the very banks that he pushed for the banker bailout to fully take over and give them governmental power, and they won't say where the trillions are, he's now saying give me more power,
[00:31:20.967 --> 00:31:23.308]  These are the very people that were irresponsible.
[00:31:23.368 --> 00:31:27.331]  No, they carried out a military operation, a financial warfare op against us.
[00:31:29.052 --> 00:31:36.196]  So now, we're all responsible and we've got to accept the new age which is giving them total world government power as announced by Newsweek.
[00:31:37.881 --> 00:31:38.881]  Homes have been lost.
[00:31:39.341 --> 00:31:40.102]  Jobs shed.
[00:31:40.182 --> 00:31:41.022]  Businesses shuttered.
[00:31:41.762 --> 00:31:43.463]  Our health care is too costly.
[00:31:43.583 --> 00:31:44.923]  Our schools fail too many.
[00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:49.744]  So, government got involved in health care 50 years ago and now it's bankrupt.
[00:31:50.264 --> 00:31:54.105]  And the states are all going bankrupt so the feds can come in and take over.
[00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:55.066]  Again, that blows them out.
[00:31:55.406 --> 00:31:59.407]  With federal mandates to give illegal aliens total health care at exorbitant prices.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.541]  Tens of billions of dollars in California and Texas alone.
[00:32:04.222 --> 00:32:20.012]  His answer is more government welfare, more government control, which is then eugenics because through socialized controlled health care, the government can force you to take the treatments they want and they can control medicine even more and cover up all their soft kill operations they're doing to the vaccines and drugs and the food.
[00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:28.497]  And each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
[00:32:29.961 --> 00:32:34.344]  Okay, the federal government for decades has only allowed one pipeline out of Alaska.
[00:32:34.484 --> 00:32:38.247]  In one area alone, there's more oil than in all of Saudi Arabia.
[00:32:38.267 --> 00:32:39.648]  It could have been here decades ago.
[00:32:39.948 --> 00:32:44.111]  They get up on TV and lie and say, if we got all the oil from Alaska, it would give us 1% more.
[00:32:45.212 --> 00:32:48.214]  And so, you've got to let us change our energy policy.
[00:32:48.314 --> 00:32:50.536]  But all that means is taxing and regulating and controlling.
[00:32:51.647 --> 00:32:54.808]  So that strengthens our enemies, so we've got to fix our energy.
[00:32:54.848 --> 00:33:05.011]  But instead of really fixing our energy and really going to a new energy system, which the Feds actually try to block, they are going to bring in all these taxes and regulations.
[00:33:07.291 --> 00:33:11.833]  These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics.
[00:33:14.253 --> 00:33:20.155]  Less measurable, but no less profound, is a sapping of confidence across our land.
[00:33:21.696 --> 00:33:33.319]  Okay, they told us the economy was great for decades as they shifted us from a manufacturing to a debtor-based service economy so we would be totally under their control and not be independent.
[00:33:33.819 --> 00:33:35.319]  The government documents state they want that.
[00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:38.880]  Destroy the family, break down communities, bankrupt the states with unfunded mandates.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:47.922]  And then he comes in and talks about how we're losing our houses and losing our jobs all done by design.
[00:33:49.326 --> 00:33:51.167]  Let's back that up again because I want to comment on it.
[00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:07.027]  Across our land.
[00:34:07.687 --> 00:34:09.349]  Okay, now what happened?
[00:34:09.809 --> 00:34:22.241]  The bankers told us everything was great while they were setting this up, while we were all going into debt, while the society was falling apart, and then they come out five months ago and say, pass our banker bailout bills, do whatever we say or we're going to have a depression, when they engineered it.
[00:34:22.441 --> 00:34:31.270]  They're given dictatorial power, they destroy the confidence, the markets start plunging, they admit we're going into a depression, and then now, oh, you've had bad confidence, it's your fault.
[00:34:33.479 --> 00:34:37.684]  A nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable.
[00:34:37.744 --> 00:34:40.627]  That the next generation must lower its sights.
[00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:47.014]  Today, I say to you that the challenges we face are real.
[00:34:48.175 --> 00:34:48.535]  Okay.
[00:34:50.597 --> 00:34:51.759]  So he's saying, yeah, we're in trouble.
[00:34:53.737 --> 00:34:57.519]  And he's saying, you know, there's this fear that America's done for, and our standard of living is going to go down.
[00:34:57.779 --> 00:35:02.662]  You hear NPR bragging, you know, decades ago, America's got too much money, got too much energy.
[00:35:02.902 --> 00:35:04.943]  Globalism will teach us to tighten up our belt.
[00:35:04.963 --> 00:35:10.006]  I remember arguing with globalists, you know, at corporate events and things I've gone to around the country.
[00:35:10.026 --> 00:35:12.748]  And they'll go, Alex, of course globalism wants to lower America.
[00:35:12.788 --> 00:35:14.068]  We have to raise the third world.
[00:35:14.429 --> 00:35:16.850]  And I go, it's not to raise the third world, it's to get control of them.
[00:35:18.956 --> 00:35:29.943]  So see, they're the ones, the Club of Rome, CFR, all of them, in their own policy reports say they wanted to de-industrialize us so they could socialize us, get control of us, destroy the middle class, disarm us, domesticate us.
[00:35:30.943 --> 00:35:33.225]  Use Americans as an engine for global domination.
[00:35:33.765 --> 00:35:36.647]  As a military district where they get their Hessian mercenaries.
[00:35:40.229 --> 00:35:42.951]  So again, here is Obama
[00:35:44.989 --> 00:35:46.731]  Laying out this plan that will save us.
[00:35:47.351 --> 00:35:49.293]  When they are the very people that have engineered all this.
[00:35:49.313 --> 00:35:52.836]  I'm going slow through this because it's important.
[00:35:53.357 --> 00:35:55.819]  I say to you that the challenges we face are real.
[00:35:56.439 --> 00:35:58.341]  They are serious and they are many.
[00:35:58.682 --> 00:36:02.345]  They will not be met easily or in a short span of time.
[00:36:02.705 --> 00:36:05.568]  But know this America, they will be met.
[00:36:09.056 --> 00:36:18.562]  So then he puts out this thing, uh, you know, we're in trouble, we've got bad confidence, things are bad, but don't worry, they will be met, I've got a solution, I'm gonna make it okay for you.
[00:36:19.563 --> 00:36:26.087]  And then everything he's saying he's gonna do is the exact same policies by design, not by accident, that brought us here.
[00:36:33.772 --> 00:36:38.195]  On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear.
[00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:42.465]  Unity of purpose over conflict and discord.
[00:36:44.166 --> 00:36:55.429]  On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics.
[00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:57.090]  Okay.
[00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:00.731]  So, hope coming together.
[00:37:01.632 --> 00:37:02.412]  Sounds great.
[00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:06.771]  We're not going to let the parties fight with each other anymore.
[00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:09.452]  The petty recriminations, we're all going to come together.
[00:37:09.473 --> 00:37:13.254]  And what do you see the PR firms that are CNN, Fox, and the rest of them?
[00:37:13.494 --> 00:37:15.175]  They're saying unity, unity, unity.
[00:37:15.235 --> 00:37:17.756]  America will only get fixed if you do everything Obama says.
[00:37:18.096 --> 00:37:18.797]  It's up to you.
[00:37:18.917 --> 00:37:22.959]  You've got to submit to whatever he says and whatever he pushes or it's over.
[00:37:23.039 --> 00:37:27.501]  And Congress, you've got to vote however he says and do whatever he says or it's over.
[00:37:28.956 --> 00:37:35.321]  And Republicans are suddenly all over TV and Pat Robertson and all these conservative leaders, who aren't real conservative, saying, yes, we've got to do whatever he says.
[00:37:35.381 --> 00:37:36.001]  It's inevitable.
[00:37:36.041 --> 00:37:36.942]  He's a good guy.
[00:37:37.082 --> 00:37:37.662]  Do what he says.
[00:37:38.003 --> 00:37:41.485]  And that's bringing the New World Order agenda, which they know is wildly unpopular.
[00:37:41.645 --> 00:37:47.549]  And they admit on the news, well, his actual policies are all very unpopular, but we've just got to get behind them because those will fix things.
[00:37:50.151 --> 00:37:51.913]  The founding fathers said gridlock was good.
[00:37:52.313 --> 00:37:54.014]  Why do we have states and a federal government?
[00:37:54.034 --> 00:37:56.316]  Why is the federal government split up in three groups that are co-equal?
[00:37:57.543 --> 00:37:58.686]  Why is the legislature?
[00:37:59.427 --> 00:38:01.191]  It's meant so that you can't get a dictator.
[00:38:01.232 --> 00:38:05.421]  It's meant so government can't amass the power and be organized to do that.
[00:38:06.397 --> 00:38:07.677]  It's a separation of powers.
[00:38:08.157 --> 00:38:09.218]  It's to bind them down.
[00:38:09.758 --> 00:38:11.078]  But see, he's saying, oh, that's bad.
[00:38:11.098 --> 00:38:17.299]  Now, he said five minutes ago, we need to continue with the Bill of Rights Constitution and our system of government that's made us so free.
[00:38:17.779 --> 00:38:35.303]  Now, though, he's coming in and saying things that are diametrically opposed to that, and any time in history, when you see media and culture in unison, and the comic books, and music, and TV, and the Hollywood stars saying, we've got to do whatever this guy says, he is the Messiah, he is the world king, this is a coronation of a king,
[00:38:35.623 --> 00:38:37.103]  He can do it, he can fix it!
[00:38:39.404 --> 00:38:41.164]  Anytime that happens, it's Hitler, Stalin, Mao.
[00:38:41.204 --> 00:38:44.685]  And even the Washington Post admits this is all very fascistic.
[00:38:45.765 --> 00:38:47.465]  But they say that's okay, because it'll save us.
[00:38:50.406 --> 00:38:58.208]  We remain a young nation, but in the words of scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.
[00:38:58.868 --> 00:39:00.908]  Okay, everything there he just said is a lie.
[00:39:01.288 --> 00:39:04.669]  The United States is now older than the Roman Republic when it confelled.
[00:39:05.694 --> 00:39:11.239]  The United States is the oldest continually government system in the world.
[00:39:11.319 --> 00:39:12.320]  235 years old.
[00:39:14.962 --> 00:39:19.526]  It's the oldest, 1776, 230 plus years old.
[00:39:21.448 --> 00:39:25.331]  It is the oldest government, continually operating government in history.
[00:39:25.851 --> 00:39:26.392]  Another lie.
[00:39:27.152 --> 00:39:30.215]  Then he quotes scripture to manipulate people religiously.
[00:39:31.236 --> 00:39:33.298]  There was another point I wanted to make, I gotta back it up even more.
[00:39:35.046 --> 00:39:40.029]  Petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas.
[00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:44.791]  The false promises?
[00:39:44.811 --> 00:39:46.512]  This guy's flip-flopping everything he said.
[00:39:47.532 --> 00:39:49.854]  That for far too long have strangled our politics.
[00:39:52.075 --> 00:39:59.859]  We remain a young nation, but in the words of scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.
[00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:08.114]  See, oh, I'm for the old, but we can't have gridlock anymore, separation of powers, and it's time to stop being children.
[00:40:08.154 --> 00:40:09.695]  America, that was old stuff.
[00:40:09.715 --> 00:40:10.716]  That was childlike.
[00:40:11.217 --> 00:40:13.458]  Now we're going forward with the new thing.
[00:40:13.478 --> 00:40:14.399]  We're adults now.
[00:40:14.659 --> 00:40:15.319]  I'm your daddy.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.140]  I'm government 2.0.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.761]  I'm president of the world.
[00:40:18.081 --> 00:40:25.507]  The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit, to choose our better history, to carry forward that precious gift.
[00:40:26.087 --> 00:40:29.489]  That noble idea passed on from generation to generation.
[00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:35.532]  The God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and... Yeah, that's right.
[00:40:35.612 --> 00:40:42.155]  All are equal, all are free, while people are being arrested for spanking their children when there's not even a law in charge under the Patriot Act for terrorism.
[00:40:42.555 --> 00:40:43.856]  That's in the Los Angeles Times.
[00:40:44.716 --> 00:40:48.639]  When people are being arrested for arguing and charged as terrorists for arguing with the stewardess.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.301]  When the drug war is getting bigger every day.
[00:40:51.501 --> 00:40:52.702]  When they're building more prisons.
[00:40:53.302 --> 00:40:56.124]  When Obama says he's going along with the Patriot Act and all the rest of it.
[00:40:57.705 --> 00:41:00.187]  When he's letting foreign banks totally loot us that he works for.
[00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:01.929]  I mean, just such deception.
[00:41:02.529 --> 00:41:05.431]  All deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.
[00:41:05.971 --> 00:41:06.192]  See?
[00:41:06.472 --> 00:41:07.593]  Oh, we all deserve a chance.
[00:41:07.613 --> 00:41:08.894]  Just everything is one-liners.
[00:41:09.354 --> 00:41:10.174]  Yeah, it's fair.
[00:41:10.395 --> 00:41:11.355]  We all deserve a chance.
[00:41:11.395 --> 00:41:12.716]  And the government's going to give you that chance.
[00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:13.377]  Just do what they say.
[00:41:19.246 --> 00:41:20.067]  And look at those people.
[00:41:20.567 --> 00:41:21.327]  Two million of them.
[00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:30.333]  In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.
[00:41:31.673 --> 00:41:32.394]  It must be earned.
[00:41:33.911 --> 00:41:37.393]  Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less.
[00:41:37.413 --> 00:41:47.639]  Okay, so he's telling you, you know, we gotta earn this Valhalla and it's gonna be tough, it's gonna be rough, I'm gonna need you to sacrifice so that the bankers can take over everything, okay?
[00:41:47.679 --> 00:41:53.002]  I need you to do what I say, it's gonna get rough, it's gonna get tough, but in the end, that's what's gonna make America great.
[00:41:53.742 --> 00:41:56.664]  As the globalists, bring us into the North American Union and commit high treason.
[00:41:58.185 --> 00:42:00.086]  It has not been the path for the fainthearted.
[00:42:02.195 --> 00:42:07.637]  See, if you're not for him, you're the fainthearted, you're a coward.
[00:42:08.117 --> 00:42:08.858]  And you're lazy.
[00:42:08.998 --> 00:42:10.678]  So, it's just everything psych warfare.
[00:42:10.738 --> 00:42:11.559]  Every line written.
[00:42:12.819 --> 00:42:13.199]  Riches and fame.
[00:42:13.219 --> 00:42:16.500]  This guy had a $170 million party.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.961]  I'm sorry, I kept saying it was $150.
[00:42:18.001 --> 00:42:18.801]  $170 million party.
[00:42:25.356 --> 00:42:28.238]  The bankers are having huge parties everywhere, looting everything.
[00:42:28.658 --> 00:42:29.939]  People are going homeless everywhere.
[00:42:29.959 --> 00:42:31.540]  It's just, it's all lies!
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.022]  The risk takers, the doers, the makers of things.
[00:42:36.883 --> 00:42:40.545]  Oh, the makers of things, under your carbon tax, shutting down all the businesses.
[00:42:41.606 --> 00:42:44.748]  See, he's just, it's like John Wayne or something's giving a speech, but it's not.
[00:42:45.428 --> 00:42:50.831]  It's a guy bringing in socialism so the bankers can domesticate and institutionalize the people of the world.
[00:42:50.872 --> 00:42:51.312]  Stay with us.
[00:42:51.532 --> 00:42:53.893]  I'm going to keep going through this whole thing no matter how long it takes.
[00:42:54.234 --> 00:42:54.654]  Stay with us.
[00:43:01.966 --> 00:43:07.708]  The School of Phenomenal Memory gives you the tools you need to memorize content quickly and efficiently.
[00:43:07.948 --> 00:43:12.909]  Just as you need to exercise your body to get into shape, you need to work out mentally to improve your memory.
[00:43:13.129 --> 00:43:19.171]  The School of Phenomenal Memory will act as your personal trainer, guiding you through a series of 60 lessons.

[00:43:31.334 --> 00:43:32.035]  We're good to go!
[00:44:02.296 --> 00:44:07.781]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:44:08.021 --> 00:44:09.322]  And we knew what to do.
[00:44:09.342 --> 00:44:11.124]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:44:11.344 --> 00:44:17.769]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:26.897]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:44:27.267 --> 00:44:34.070]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:37.411]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:44:37.551 --> 00:44:42.754]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:44:43.314 --> 00:44:45.935]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:44:57.779 --> 00:45:03.921]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:45:04.041 --> 00:45:10.742]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:45:10.982 --> 00:45:19.164]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:45:19.384 --> 00:45:25.105]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:45:25.285 --> 00:45:27.066]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:45:27.126 --> 00:45:29.287]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:45:29.307 --> 00:45:33.669]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.

[00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:06.513]  Alright, let's go straight back to it.
[00:46:06.573 --> 00:46:07.774]  Here's Barack Obama.
[00:46:12.483 --> 00:46:14.083]  You guys cut Mario off to it in there.
[00:46:14.103 --> 00:46:19.625]  They've carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.
[00:46:21.706 --> 00:46:22.306]  For us!
[00:46:23.646 --> 00:46:28.267]  The long rugged path of prosperity and freedom when all you see is tyranny growing around you.
[00:46:29.148 --> 00:46:30.068]  It's just all lies.
[00:46:30.708 --> 00:46:35.590]  They packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.
[00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:37.310]  For us!
[00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.291]  They toiled in sweatshops and settled the West.
[00:46:41.038 --> 00:46:41.919]  We're good to go.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:47:02.646]  Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life.
[00:47:03.607 --> 00:47:06.930]  So see now it's love of the ancestors, America, the wars.
[00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:11.153]  It's just, oh God, he loves America when he's a globalist destroying America.
[00:47:12.695 --> 00:47:16.237]  They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions.
[00:47:17.138 --> 00:47:19.100]  Greater than all the differences.
[00:47:20.081 --> 00:47:22.503]  Oh, they saw America as greater as our individual
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.761]  Desires and wishes.
[00:47:24.801 --> 00:47:29.084]  We've got to fork that over and go into the hive mind and do whatever it says.
[00:47:29.124 --> 00:47:30.205]  They just keep repeating that.
[00:47:30.866 --> 00:47:32.107]  Hive mind, hive mind.
[00:47:32.147 --> 00:47:33.648]  Gotta do what we say, gotta do what we say.
[00:47:33.848 --> 00:47:36.010]  When they're the ones that engineered it all, publicly.
[00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:38.072]  Birth or wealth or faction.
[00:47:39.653 --> 00:47:43.756]  This is... See, we can't have a second amendment faction that's the constitution faction.
[00:47:44.157 --> 00:47:46.799]  We can't have, no no, we just gotta do what he says.
[00:47:47.719 --> 00:47:49.040]  The journey we continue today.
[00:47:50.342 --> 00:47:53.024]  We will remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on earth.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.263]  Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began.
[00:47:58.184 --> 00:47:59.646]  Our minds are no less inventive.
[00:48:00.026 --> 00:48:04.631]  Our goods and services... They have de-industrialized us by design.
[00:48:04.671 --> 00:48:05.933]  They have wrecked this nation.
[00:48:06.213 --> 00:48:14.102]  They have completely dumbed down our children from number one in the world 50 years ago to the stupidest people in the world in all major international studies.
[00:48:15.322 --> 00:48:16.223]  Total lies!
[00:48:16.823 --> 00:48:21.505]  They have engineered us under eugenics to be a bunch of manageable cow cattle.
[00:48:21.946 --> 00:48:25.628]  ...less needed than they were last week or last month or last year.
[00:48:27.068 --> 00:48:29.390]  Our capacity remains undiminished.
[00:48:31.111 --> 00:48:39.055]  But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions, that time has surely passed.
[00:48:40.362 --> 00:48:45.057]  Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust our... You heard that.
[00:48:45.298 --> 00:48:47.324]  Unpleasant decisions, because they know.
[00:48:48.837 --> 00:48:50.678]  The carbon tax, people aren't going to like that.
[00:48:50.718 --> 00:48:52.520]  It's going to wreck even more industry that's left.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.943]  They know people aren't going to like all the new taxes and regulations.
[00:48:56.003 --> 00:48:57.404]  They know they're not going to like new wars.
[00:48:57.744 --> 00:49:00.866]  They keep saying, you're not going to like this, but you've got to do it if you're American.
[00:49:00.886 --> 00:49:03.248]  You've got to prove you'll do whatever we say.
[00:49:03.488 --> 00:49:09.873]  Because doing what the government says, and the bureaucrats say, and the foreign bankers say, and the foundations say, that's what America is.
[00:49:10.974 --> 00:49:14.197]  Off and begin again the work of remaking America.
[00:49:16.531 --> 00:49:18.613]  Remaking America.
[00:49:19.013 --> 00:49:23.136]  He says we're going to go back to the good times, but we're going to remake it.
[00:49:23.256 --> 00:49:25.758]  Everywhere we look, there's work to be done.
[00:49:26.779 --> 00:49:29.801]  The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift.
[00:49:30.142 --> 00:49:30.842]  And we will act.
[00:49:31.763 --> 00:49:34.945]  Not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth.
[00:49:35.926 --> 00:49:36.587]  Oh, they're acting.
[00:49:36.607 --> 00:49:38.808]  They've already had the banks take over with him spearheading it.
[00:49:38.848 --> 00:49:41.310]  Now he's talking about even more power in tens of trillions more for him.
[00:49:41.791 --> 00:49:42.972]  So yeah, they're going to act swiftly.
[00:49:43.252 --> 00:49:44.153]  He's already acting today.
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:59.872]  We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital... Okay, when you hear that, that means under Bush's executive order, and Obama supports it, forcing the states to hand over their infrastructure, their roads, to foreign offshore toll companies like CentraZachary of Spain.
[00:50:00.753 --> 00:50:01.394]  That's on record.
[00:50:02.835 --> 00:50:06.738]  So handing over the power plants, everything, to these people.
[00:50:06.858 --> 00:50:07.999]  Looting the infrastructure.
[00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:11.082]  ...lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
[00:50:12.318 --> 00:50:19.642]  We will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology's wonders to raise healthcare's quality and lower its cost.
[00:50:21.103 --> 00:50:23.384]  Total and complete bull.
[00:50:26.326 --> 00:50:28.827]  You look at Bill Clinton so angry in that video we were just showing.
[00:50:29.187 --> 00:50:32.229]  He wants that wicked power and these people all hate each other at the top.
[00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:39.893]  Back in 70 seconds, I will continue breaking this down straight ahead and then your phone calls and some in-studio guests as well.
[00:50:39.914 --> 00:50:40.314]  Stay with me.
[00:50:42.825 --> 00:50:46.046]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:51.767 --> 00:50:52.367]  Hello, friends.
[00:50:52.407 --> 00:50:53.367]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:50:53.467 --> 00:50:58.068]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:58.208 --> 00:51:00.948]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:51:01.169 --> 00:51:04.029]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:04.209 --> 00:51:08.930]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.091]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:10.291 --> 00:51:13.233]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:13.533 --> 00:51:20.439]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:20.519 --> 00:51:23.661]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:51:40.516 --> 00:51:40.936]  Take action today.
[00:51:40.956 --> 00:51:42.938]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:54.565 --> 00:51:56.486]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:56.966 --> 00:51:59.828]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:06.352 --> 00:52:06.992]  Big Brother.
[00:52:07.652 --> 00:52:08.713]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:09.433 --> 00:52:10.534]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:12.015]  You want answers?
[00:52:12.755 --> 00:52:13.716]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:14.316 --> 00:52:18.278]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:18.498 --> 00:52:22.581]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:25.276 --> 00:52:32.339]  We are back live analyzing Barack Obama's key inauguration speech.
[00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:34.460]  Coronation speech.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.201]  Let's go back to it right now.
[00:52:38.721 --> 00:52:44.023]  We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.
[00:52:44.424 --> 00:52:49.906]  And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.
[00:52:50.931 --> 00:52:52.092]  A new age again.
[00:52:52.152 --> 00:52:52.892]  A new age.
[00:52:52.952 --> 00:52:53.613]  A new world order.
[00:52:53.673 --> 00:52:54.353]  The capstone.
[00:52:54.393 --> 00:52:56.614]  So, you know, wind, solar, it's a good idea.
[00:52:57.495 --> 00:52:58.035]  All for it.
[00:52:58.455 --> 00:53:00.256]  But again, as if the government's doing it.
[00:53:00.316 --> 00:53:01.717]  As if the government's going to finance it.
[00:53:01.737 --> 00:53:04.459]  They're going to control what technologies get developed, what don't.
[00:53:05.079 --> 00:53:05.880]  Things they control.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.963]  So again, he throws in some reasonable sounding things and then says, in our new age.
[00:53:13.364 --> 00:53:14.505]  All this we can do.
[00:53:15.585 --> 00:53:16.506]  All this we will do.
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:20.702]  Yes we can, Bob the Builder, la la la.
[00:53:21.042 --> 00:53:22.222]  Can we fix it?
[00:53:22.322 --> 00:53:23.283]  Yes we can!
[00:53:23.303 --> 00:53:28.705]  Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions.
[00:53:30.026 --> 00:53:33.528]  Who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.
[00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:39.814]  Well, there are some that stand in the way of big government and corporate welfare and the bankers running everything.
[00:53:39.834 --> 00:53:42.316]  Well, they're the ones that are going to stop what we're doing.
[00:53:42.336 --> 00:53:43.437]  They're the ones that caused it all.
[00:53:43.637 --> 00:53:44.878]  Not the bankers I work for.
[00:53:44.939 --> 00:53:45.659]  Not the globalists.
[00:53:45.979 --> 00:53:46.540]  No, no.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:51.624]  Even though they fill my administration, the very ones that did all this, admittedly, it's you.
[00:53:51.724 --> 00:53:52.445]  You caused it.
[00:53:53.106 --> 00:53:55.027]  You're standing in the way of Valhalla.
[00:53:56.168 --> 00:53:57.129]  Their memories are short.
[00:53:58.811 --> 00:54:01.053]  For they have forgotten what this country has already done.
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:08.403]  Oh, those of us that don't want big government and secret police and youth brigades and gun control and gun confiscation.
[00:54:08.764 --> 00:54:10.364]  We've forgotten what America did.
[00:54:10.424 --> 00:54:11.785]  We don't like America.
[00:54:12.145 --> 00:54:14.026]  We're not can-do go-getters.
[00:54:14.126 --> 00:54:15.627]  Man, boy, shut up.
[00:54:16.148 --> 00:54:17.248]  I like Barack.
[00:54:17.288 --> 00:54:18.529]  He's getting it done.
[00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:26.173]  And women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage.
[00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:32.051]  What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them.
[00:54:33.925 --> 00:54:34.445]  Oh, we know.
[00:54:34.485 --> 00:54:36.026]  You've engineered a massive crisis.
[00:54:36.046 --> 00:54:37.767]  You're stampeding the people through terror.
[00:54:37.967 --> 00:54:39.968]  They stage terror, stampede them for police state.
[00:54:40.249 --> 00:54:44.111]  Now they shift the police state publicly for what it was built for against the American people.
[00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:47.673]  And now they're terrorizing us with what they've done financially.
[00:54:48.394 --> 00:54:50.435]  And they're saying, hey, the cynics don't understand.
[00:54:50.695 --> 00:54:51.876]  The ground shifted beneath you.
[00:54:52.116 --> 00:54:53.617]  We scared the hell out of these people.
[00:54:53.797 --> 00:54:55.518]  We're using psych warfare and they're coming.
[00:54:55.698 --> 00:54:56.779]  You will be absorbed.
[00:54:56.999 --> 00:54:58.120]  Resistance is futile.
[00:54:59.161 --> 00:54:59.861]  That's their message.
[00:54:59.881 --> 00:55:06.464]  Well, it isn't futile, and that's why in your internal documents you say you've got 200 days to try to gut this country and the world.
[00:55:06.904 --> 00:55:08.025]  And you're going to fail!
[00:55:11.106 --> 00:55:15.128]  Political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.
[00:55:15.788 --> 00:55:16.208]  Oh, really?
[00:55:16.268 --> 00:55:22.331]  All of our political arguments were right about globalism being bad, NAFTA and GATT being bad, people going into debt, having big government.
[00:55:24.318 --> 00:55:25.578]  We were right about all of that.
[00:55:25.638 --> 00:55:30.180]  We were on target about all of those major issues the entire time.
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:32.060]  We were here telling the truth.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.440]  We've been right.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.221]  We've predicted what happened accurately.
[00:55:37.061 --> 00:55:39.562]  And then he's implying we caused all of this.
[00:55:39.942 --> 00:55:45.023]  That because we didn't accept bigger government and more control, that it's our fault.
[00:55:45.104 --> 00:55:46.524]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[00:55:46.584 --> 00:55:47.384]  Listen to that again.
[00:55:52.585 --> 00:55:56.287]  What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them.
[00:55:57.268 --> 00:55:58.088]  That's what they always say.
[00:55:58.128 --> 00:56:01.370]  Oh, you're just a Bush basher because you don't like secret arrest and FEMA camps.
[00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.311]  No, that's not for you, it's for Al Qaeda.
[00:56:03.491 --> 00:56:04.512]  Now it's in the news, it's for us.
[00:56:06.173 --> 00:56:08.034]  Oh, you're just an Obama basher racist.
[00:56:08.314 --> 00:56:09.655]  We're just cynics, you know.
[00:56:10.075 --> 00:56:14.418]  We don't want to have his new Attorney General ban all semi-automatic handguns and rifles as he's announced.
[00:56:15.691 --> 00:56:17.372]  You know, we're just cynics, you know.
[00:56:17.812 --> 00:56:18.832]  We're just negative.
[00:56:18.852 --> 00:56:19.552]  Turn them in!
[00:56:19.612 --> 00:56:20.213]  It's friendly!
[00:56:21.253 --> 00:56:26.415]  Stale political arguments!
[00:56:26.635 --> 00:56:30.576]  They ignored the will of the people, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, set up this New World Order.
[00:56:30.736 --> 00:56:32.097]  They're bringing us into the final phase.
[00:56:32.157 --> 00:56:37.278]  Newsweek and the Financial Times of London are saying world government run by world bankers, where we pay carbon taxes.
[00:56:37.699 --> 00:56:41.560]  Something people wrote 30 years ago telling you they were going to do, because they could read the government documents.
[00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:48.193]  And then the very people responsible sit up there like the saviors saying it's our fault!
[00:56:48.453 --> 00:56:50.715]  They did all of this by design!
[00:56:50.735 --> 00:56:55.858]  We're gonna come back to this piece of filth liar and finish up with this.
[00:56:56.238 --> 00:56:57.519]  Oh, it's unbelievable!
[00:56:57.739 --> 00:56:58.980]  Resist these monsters!
[00:57:02.296 --> 00:57:03.818]  These are strange new days.
[00:57:04.178 --> 00:57:05.960]  Foreclosures are at record highs.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.501]  People are losing their jobs.
[00:57:07.782 --> 00:57:09.744]  The threat of a terrorist attack looms.
[00:57:10.004 --> 00:57:12.166]  Food supplies are at an all-time low.
[00:57:12.366 --> 00:57:14.469]  And now we have a new untested president.
[00:57:14.689 --> 00:57:16.391]  The time of change is upon us.
[00:57:16.471 --> 00:57:21.176]  And to those of you who are in the know, you realize that the most difficult times have yet to be seen.
[00:57:21.776 --> 00:57:22.257]  I think so.
[00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:43.586]  I don't think so.
[00:58:02.014 --> 00:58:14.719]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:58:15.159 --> 00:58:21.902]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:58:22.262 --> 00:58:25.823]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:58:26.203 --> 00:58:29.403]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:58:29.624 --> 00:58:31.344]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:58:31.384 --> 00:58:37.125]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:12.428]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.189 --> 01:00:14.170]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.751 --> 01:00:18.416]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.957 --> 01:00:23.002]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.491 --> 01:00:25.752]  Alright, we're back live here.
[01:00:25.852 --> 01:00:29.516]  Ladies and gentlemen, remember, we've written scores of articles linked to hundreds.
[01:00:29.716 --> 01:00:31.618]  I'm making a film about Barack Obama.
[01:00:32.079 --> 01:00:36.823]  Everything we're saying about their agenda, who he works for, who he is, is in their own words.
[01:00:37.744 --> 01:00:42.329]  They are butchering the U.S., bringing us into world government, destroying our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:00:42.609 --> 01:00:44.050]  Bush has passed the baton off.
[01:00:44.271 --> 01:00:46.713]  We're 26 hours into the baton being passed off.
[01:00:46.733 --> 01:00:48.215]  They're making him a messianic leader.
[01:00:48.755 --> 01:00:51.136]  Telling the public everything will be okay if you just do what we say.
[01:00:51.176 --> 01:01:01.543]  Just like they said, pass the banker bailout, we'll fix the subprime mortgages, let the credit flow, and the next day they said, well that actually wasn't the problem, we're keeping the money, it's secret, and by the way, $4 trillion is missing from the Pentagon Trust Funds.
[01:01:01.703 --> 01:01:02.183]  It's all gone.
[01:01:02.503 --> 01:01:03.744]  They're just stealing everything.
[01:01:03.764 --> 01:01:11.789]  This is a group of crooks, with PR, trying to suppress the public from resisting or saying no, and if we try to resist, they've got NORTHCOM and the military to crack down on us.
[01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:14.751]  All those years they said it wasn't for us, now they admit it's for us.
[01:01:15.031 --> 01:01:15.651]  That's on record.
[01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:16.632]  Let's go back to it.
[01:01:21.486 --> 01:01:22.278]  I'm gonna apply.
[01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:29.211]  The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works.
[01:01:30.072 --> 01:01:34.554]  Whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, or retire.
[01:01:35.034 --> 01:01:38.496]  See, it isn't about whether the government's big or small, but by the way, we're going to make it huge.
[01:01:39.036 --> 01:01:40.357]  Bush only tripled the size of it.
[01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:41.657]  It's about, does it work?
[01:01:41.677 --> 01:01:42.878]  Does it find you jobs?
[01:01:42.998 --> 01:01:45.579]  The government gave incentives to move offshore to companies.
[01:01:45.959 --> 01:01:47.620]  The government does all this criminal stuff.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.381]  The government's totally bankrupt and illegitimate.
[01:01:49.521 --> 01:01:50.541]  It's been secret since 1947 completely.
[01:01:52.674 --> 01:01:53.634]  But that isn't the question.
[01:01:54.135 --> 01:01:55.455]  It doesn't get you a job.
[01:01:55.655 --> 01:01:56.976]  I'm going to give you something.
[01:01:58.297 --> 01:02:05.400]  They take the productive people's money, they keep on average 70% of it the feds, and then they give you the 30% of the money with strings attached.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.282]  ...that is dignified.
[01:02:10.623 --> 01:02:13.324]  When the answer is yes, we intend to move forward.
[01:02:14.105 --> 01:02:16.446]  When the answer is no, programs will end.
[01:02:17.796 --> 01:02:21.178]  And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account.
[01:02:21.679 --> 01:02:22.019]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:22.059 --> 01:02:22.819]  To spend wisely.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:23.700]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.460]  Reform bad habits.
[01:02:24.981 --> 01:02:26.902]  And do our business.
[01:02:26.922 --> 01:02:28.723]  Spend wisely, $170 million for the parties they had.
[01:02:29.504 --> 01:02:31.325]  Not to mention the security separate from that.
[01:02:32.506 --> 01:02:33.546]  Oh, spend wisely.
[01:02:33.787 --> 01:02:34.387]  Oh, yes.
[01:02:34.447 --> 01:02:35.608]  That's exactly what's happening.
[01:02:35.908 --> 01:02:38.810]  With your entire cabinet full of people that did the actual robbing.
[01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:50.588]  I mean, it's just... ...in the light of day, because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and... We're gonna do this during the light of day.
[01:02:50.608 --> 01:02:53.190]  He's gonna make a few comments about the police state, but accelerate it.
[01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:55.151]  Oh, we're gonna do this in the light of the day.
[01:02:55.392 --> 01:02:56.513]  Government's gonna be transparent.
[01:02:56.953 --> 01:02:57.674]  ...and their government.
[01:03:00.876 --> 01:03:05.740]  Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill.
[01:03:07.161 --> 01:03:10.224]  Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched.
[01:03:11.701 --> 01:03:13.242]  This hasn't been a free market.
[01:03:13.282 --> 01:03:24.166]  It's private central banks that issue and control all the currency and credit, massing all the wealth under themselves, running stock markets like cash machines to cheat the public, and now they're just stealing all your pension funds.
[01:03:24.647 --> 01:03:27.228]  So they go, oh, is the free market at fault for all this?
[01:03:27.268 --> 01:03:28.368]  This isn't a free market.
[01:03:30.989 --> 01:03:33.991]  This crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye,
[01:03:35.991 --> 01:03:58.907]  Without a watchful eye, that means more regulations on you, but the very regulators that are revolving door with the big banks and brokerage houses, running things and expanding the theft, and then the bankers just stole 8.5 trillion with him heading it up, and setting it up at the Bilderberg Group meetings, and then he's talking about transparency and how we're going to watch the government, we're going to do all this, and today he's announcing more power to the banks, secretly.
[01:03:59.408 --> 01:04:00.609]  It's just all lies!
[01:04:01.841 --> 01:04:02.482]  ...out of control.
[01:04:03.083 --> 01:04:07.868]  The nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.
[01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:16.819]  The success of our economy has always depended not just... This guy is claiming he's going to fight Wall Street when he is the greatest Wall Street candidate ever.
[01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:24.357]  He's saying, oh we're gonna, this nation can only prosper when the rich are prospering.
[01:04:24.597 --> 01:04:33.899]  When this guy, they set up government taxes to take your money and give it to the ultra elite, but he knows this crowd thinks somebody in a $100,000 house is rich.
[01:04:33.919 --> 01:04:39.580]  Not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.221]  On the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart.
[01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:45.459]  Not out of charity.
[01:04:45.879 --> 01:04:47.860]  Oh, the government's going to extend help.
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:56.583]  Just like he just passed a big eugenics package for forced abortion in China and abortions in Africa.
[01:04:56.603 --> 01:04:57.604]  That's a helping hand.
[01:04:58.384 --> 01:04:59.404]  Well, he's really going to help you.
[01:05:00.265 --> 01:05:03.046]  But because it is the surest route to our common good.
[01:05:05.367 --> 01:05:06.227]  Our common good.
[01:05:06.247 --> 01:05:07.187]  Everything's common.
[01:05:10.148 --> 01:05:11.489]  As for our common defense,
[01:05:13.424 --> 01:05:19.467]  We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.
[01:05:19.648 --> 01:05:30.794]  Our founding fathers faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man.
[01:05:31.714 --> 01:05:34.376]  A charter expanded by the blood of generations.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:41.104]  Then the camera cuts to Bush like, ooh, he took your Bill of Rights, he took your Constitution.
[01:05:41.505 --> 01:05:52.155]  Meanwhile, they're bringing in General Jim Jones, they're keeping Gates, they're expanding NORTHCOM, Obama's announcing more troops on the streets of America.
[01:05:52.395 --> 01:05:55.258]  He had 47,000 of them, including regular army there.
[01:05:55.959 --> 01:05:57.100]  It's just all bait and switch!
[01:05:58.021 --> 01:05:59.982]  Because it's unpopular, the police state.
[01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:01.163]  It's unpopular, NORTHCOM.
[01:06:01.183 --> 01:06:02.003]  The people know about it now.
[01:06:02.343 --> 01:06:04.044]  He's saying, our founding fathers, our Bill of Rights.
[01:06:04.064 --> 01:06:05.065]  He didn't want to mention it by name.
[01:06:05.105 --> 01:06:06.166]  He said, a charter.
[01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:11.689]  And you watch what he does.
[01:06:11.889 --> 01:06:13.530]  You watch what he does.
[01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:15.371]  Oh, we're shutting down Guantanamo.
[01:06:15.411 --> 01:06:16.091]  Read the fine print.
[01:06:16.311 --> 01:06:17.632]  Secret camps in the U.S.
[01:06:17.892 --> 01:06:18.452]  ABC News.
[01:06:20.874 --> 01:06:21.794]  These people are incredible.
[01:06:24.055 --> 01:06:24.896]  Still like the world.
[01:06:25.919 --> 01:06:28.240]  And we will not give them up for expedience sake.
[01:06:31.481 --> 01:06:47.706]  And so, to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born, know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity.
[01:06:48.086 --> 01:06:50.507]  And we are ready to lead once more.
[01:06:51.459 --> 01:06:58.681]  You know, what Bush did is what the military industrial complex and the banks wanted, and the Rand Corporation, the PNAC documents, the CFR, what the Democrats wanted.
[01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:00.202]  This is the same agenda.
[01:07:00.902 --> 01:07:06.964]  But see, now it's, I love you while we carpet bomb you, I love you while we put embargoes on you, I love you people.
[01:07:08.065 --> 01:07:09.045]  I care about you.
[01:07:27.463 --> 01:07:36.569]  Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism, not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
[01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:43.014]  They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.
[01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:47.477]  Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use.
[01:07:48.778 --> 01:07:50.679]  Our power grows through its prudent use.
[01:07:50.739 --> 01:07:54.501]  The Milner Group out of England funded Hitler to destroy Europe, then they brought him down.
[01:07:54.541 --> 01:07:56.243]  They funded the Soviets the whole time.
[01:07:57.512 --> 01:07:58.253]  They funded, the U.S.
[01:07:58.273 --> 01:08:00.334]  government funded Pol Pot to kill three million people.
[01:08:00.354 --> 01:08:01.135]  That's all on record.
[01:08:01.175 --> 01:08:04.977]  His chief advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, writes books about it, bragging how he did it.
[01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:09.591]  Again, just total deception.
[01:08:10.351 --> 01:08:19.676]  So they build their infrastructure, blame Bush for it, and then say, oh, that infrastructure isn't there anymore, as they arrest people on airplanes for spilling Bloody Marys, and charge them under the Patriot Act, L.A.
[01:08:19.716 --> 01:08:20.016]  Times.
[01:08:20.797 --> 01:08:26.660]  Our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the temper and quality.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.202]  Our security emanates from the justness of our cause globally.
[01:08:32.123 --> 01:08:33.283]  Fighting El Cieda.
[01:08:33.744 --> 01:08:36.025]  Qualities of humility and restraint.
[01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:40.961]  We are the keepers of this legacy.
[01:08:42.563 --> 01:08:51.017]  Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, even greater cooperation and understanding between nations.
[01:08:52.435 --> 01:08:57.117]  We'll begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard-earned peace.
[01:08:57.738 --> 01:09:07.262]  Okay, they've built hundreds of bases, 34 giant ones that hold thousands apiece, the biggest in Baghdad, the embassy that holds 4,000, 5,000 people.
[01:09:08.983 --> 01:09:11.164]  They've openly said it was the original plan they had.
[01:09:11.484 --> 01:09:20.789]  I told you they'd be there for decades, that within six to seven years of the invasion, they would build the permanent bases, leave 50,000 troops there, and then bring in I-4 United Nations troops.
[01:09:22.335 --> 01:09:26.856]  And that's what they've now announced, because I was reading the official army documents that were public.
[01:09:27.276 --> 01:09:28.716]  It just wasn't put out on the news.
[01:09:29.797 --> 01:09:31.617]  So, again, total lies.
[01:09:31.637 --> 01:09:37.478]  They're just going to move 50,000 of the troops out of Iraq over into Afghanistan.
[01:09:37.918 --> 01:09:40.179]  And then also move some of the troops to encircle Russia.
[01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:42.279]  That's just unbelievable, man.
[01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:44.780]  And he's talking about Iran, too, going in there.
[01:09:46.863 --> 01:09:52.469]  With old friends and former foes, we'll work tirelessly to lessen an understanding between nations.
[01:09:53.891 --> 01:09:59.337]  We'll begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.
[01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:08.167]  With old friends and former foes, we'll work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet.
[01:10:09.864 --> 01:10:10.764]  We will not apologize.
[01:10:10.965 --> 01:10:11.605]  Did you hear that?
[01:10:11.645 --> 01:10:16.207]  We're going to fight Al Qaeda, the terrorist, and the other terrorist, the warming planet.
[01:10:16.227 --> 01:10:38.098]  Now remember what, in 1992, the Club of Rome put out a document, it was republished last year by Richard N. Haas, he wrote it, head of the Council on Foreign Relations, that he wrote back at Club of Rome, the big globalist think tank that sets a lot of policies, where they said we're going to use fake terror to attack the people and enslave them, they say this, and we're going to use fake environmental crises, climate change, to attack them in that pincer attack.
[01:10:38.658 --> 01:10:40.219]  And see, he just said the exact line.
[01:10:40.879 --> 01:10:48.583]  But, oh, we're going to fight Al Qaeda, keep you safe, but we're going to do it real loving and sweet, under the Bill of Rights, and we're going to fight the warming planet.
[01:10:49.684 --> 01:10:51.445]  As if the planet doesn't warm and cool down.
[01:10:51.465 --> 01:10:54.006]  I mean, it's just, and we're going to tax the carbon cycle.
[01:10:55.086 --> 01:10:58.869]  ...apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense.
[01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:12.562]  And for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that... So you just said, we'll defend the earth, we're gonna fight the earth and save it by taxing you to the central banks, giving all your money to foreign banks that have bankrupted everything.
[01:11:12.742 --> 01:11:14.263]  Has nothing to do with the environment, but we'll do it.
[01:11:14.463 --> 01:11:16.265]  And then we're also those that are slaughtering innocents.
[01:11:16.485 --> 01:11:20.008]  He goes from global warming, saving the earth, to, and those that are killing children.
[01:11:20.649 --> 01:11:22.570]  See, the same line.
[01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:25.290]  Saving the Earth is stopping terrorists killing children.
[01:11:26.091 --> 01:11:28.711]  Global taxes, environmental taxes, terrorism.
[01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:31.332]  He just keeps mixing them together.
[01:11:32.632 --> 01:11:35.253]  Our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken.
[01:11:35.533 --> 01:11:38.434]  You cannot outlast us and we will defeat you.
[01:11:39.773 --> 01:11:40.454]  Did you hear that?
[01:11:40.634 --> 01:11:42.656]  Our spirit is stronger, like the people are with him.
[01:11:43.096 --> 01:11:44.177]  Our spirit is stronger.
[01:11:44.698 --> 01:11:45.859]  We will outlast you.
[01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:48.021]  We will get our global warming taxes.
[01:11:48.061 --> 01:11:51.985]  We will go out and slaughter third world nations in the name of stopping terrorists that are hurting children.
[01:11:52.246 --> 01:11:53.367]  You will not stop us.
[01:11:53.407 --> 01:11:54.548]  We will absorb you.
[01:11:54.788 --> 01:11:55.549]  We are coming.
[01:11:55.569 --> 01:11:57.891]  I am Baracus of the Borg.
[01:11:57.911 --> 01:11:59.132]  Stay with us.
[01:12:02.476 --> 01:12:03.577]  The headlines are clear.
[01:12:04.264 --> 01:12:06.706]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:12:07.186 --> 01:12:09.728]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:12:10.388 --> 01:12:12.030]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:15.332]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:12:15.452 --> 01:12:19.094]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope to stay free.
[01:12:20.115 --> 01:12:23.557]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[01:12:23.778 --> 01:12:27.120]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.862]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[01:12:30.002 --> 01:12:34.625]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[01:12:34.645 --> 01:12:37.727]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[01:12:37.767 --> 01:12:43.711]  Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money.
[01:12:43.851 --> 01:12:46.793]  Selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[01:12:46.973 --> 01:12:48.414]  Restaurants and small delis.
[01:12:48.454 --> 01:12:49.675]  Don't buy from copycats.
[01:12:49.855 --> 01:12:51.716]  Their fancy packaging is not free.
[01:12:51.977 --> 01:12:53.838]  Order today before it's too late.
[01:12:53.918 --> 01:12:55.739]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:12:55.799 --> 01:12:57.961]  That's SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:12:58.141 --> 01:13:00.043]  A long-term food solution.
[01:13:01.786 --> 01:13:02.746]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:13:02.826 --> 01:13:07.628]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:13:07.788 --> 01:13:15.591]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:13:15.851 --> 01:13:21.213]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:13:21.433 --> 01:13:28.396]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:13:28.696 --> 01:13:34.018]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:13:34.299 --> 01:13:39.021]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:13:39.361 --> 01:13:46.984]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:13:47.304 --> 01:13:53.547]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:13:53.867 --> 01:13:54.988]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:57.731 --> 01:13:57.991]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.621]  But who is the enemy?
[01:14:12.141 --> 01:14:12.662]  Bin Laden.
[01:14:12.922 --> 01:14:13.922]  This is his M.O.
[01:14:13.943 --> 01:14:15.243]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:14:15.283 --> 01:14:16.945]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:14:17.305 --> 01:14:24.050]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:24.891]  Some U.S.
[01:14:24.931 --> 01:14:30.615]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:14:31.275 --> 01:14:34.758]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:14:34.778 --> 01:14:36.940]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:15:00.956 --> 01:15:06.699]  The School of Phenomenal Memory gives you the tools you need to memorize content quickly and efficiently.
[01:15:06.939 --> 01:15:11.881]  Just as you need to exercise your body to get into shape, you need to work out mentally to improve your memory.
[01:15:12.121 --> 01:15:18.164]  The School of Phenomenal Memory will act as your personal trainer, guiding you through a series of 60 lessons.
[01:15:18.484 --> 01:15:24.887]  Once completed, you'll gain a dramatic improvement in your ability to memorize, in turn, improving your ability to learn.
[01:15:25.268 --> 01:15:30.350]  Our course is not based on mnemonics, memorization techniques, or other tricks that you simply can't apply
[01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:31.090]  We're good to go!
[01:15:57.568 --> 01:15:58.929]  You can run on for a long time
[01:16:11.391 --> 01:16:13.092]  Run on for a long time.
[01:16:13.133 --> 01:16:15.955]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:16:16.575 --> 01:16:18.897]  Run on for a long time.
[01:16:19.498 --> 01:16:21.640]  Run on for a long time.
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:24.802]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:16:25.323 --> 01:16:27.765]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:36.052]  So you see Pat Robertson, all the people saying Obama is invincible, he's good, nothing can stop him.
[01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:51.274]  That's a mind game.
[01:16:51.314 --> 01:16:53.195]  They want to make you give up and think you can't beat them.
[01:16:53.235 --> 01:16:54.235]  These guys are in trouble.
[01:16:54.475 --> 01:16:55.276]  They know they're crooks.
[01:16:55.316 --> 01:16:56.816]  They know they're trying to set up a world government.
[01:16:57.216 --> 01:16:59.457]  They know the people are waking up and they're robbing us.
[01:16:59.938 --> 01:17:02.799]  So he's coming out saying, hey, we're not going to let you hurt the economy.
[01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:04.460]  We're invincible.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.242]  And then he suddenly gets into terrorism.
[01:17:08.422 --> 01:17:13.064]  As if you're not for taking over the global carbon tax, you're with terrorists.
[01:17:13.764 --> 01:17:15.505]  The specter of a warming planet.
[01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:19.317]  We will not apologize for our way of life.
[01:17:20.058 --> 01:17:21.899]  Nor will we waver in its defense.
[01:17:22.479 --> 01:17:28.243]  And for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents... Did you hear that?
[01:17:28.283 --> 01:17:30.084]  He says we're going to have global warming tax.
[01:17:30.785 --> 01:17:34.347]  And then he says we won't let you stop our way of life when this will kill our way of life.
[01:17:35.418 --> 01:17:36.618]  And then he goes into terrorism.
[01:17:36.938 --> 01:17:39.179]  This is hardcore mind control, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:39.779 --> 01:17:43.541]  We say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken.
[01:17:43.821 --> 01:17:46.782]  You cannot outlast us and we will defeat you.
[01:17:49.382 --> 01:17:51.183]  We will defeat your New World Order.
[01:17:51.923 --> 01:17:53.844]  We will expose the globalists.
[01:17:55.124 --> 01:17:56.004]  We're gonna defeat you.
[01:17:56.044 --> 01:17:58.445]  We're gonna expose your lies and show everybody what a liar you are.
[01:17:58.465 --> 01:18:00.886]  For we know
[01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:05.965]  That our patchwork heritage... Did you hear that, Mind Control?
[01:18:06.246 --> 01:18:08.447]  We know our patchwork heritage.
[01:18:08.487 --> 01:18:10.227]  Making everybody think of every group as me.
[01:18:10.908 --> 01:18:11.428]  We know.
[01:18:11.468 --> 01:18:12.408]  See, it's you're with me.
[01:18:12.869 --> 01:18:13.949]  It's just all programming.
[01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:17.050]  See how they're doing that, guys, in there in the control room?
[01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:20.352]  I mean, this is psychological warfare.
[01:18:20.372 --> 01:18:23.573]  It's a strength, not a weakness.
[01:18:23.813 --> 01:18:24.914]  See, we know we have strength.
[01:18:25.074 --> 01:18:26.855]  We're a nation of Christians and Muslims.
[01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:28.780]  Jews and Hindus.
[01:18:29.541 --> 01:18:33.704]  And non... And see now, if you don't agree with him, you're against Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus.
[01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:37.468]  See, it's just all, this whole thing, it's unbelievable.
[01:18:37.788 --> 01:18:40.090]  Never seen such lies and deception and twisting.
[01:18:40.571 --> 01:18:40.991]  ...believers.
[01:18:42.312 --> 01:18:44.654]  We are shaped by every language and culture.
[01:18:44.994 --> 01:18:48.578]  Drawn from every... We're a nation of believers.
[01:18:48.678 --> 01:18:51.000]  So see, now you're an atheist if you don't agree with Obama.
[01:18:54.403 --> 01:18:55.325]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:18:55.365 --> 01:18:57.589]  He's saying, the people that are against us are terrorists.
[01:18:57.609 --> 01:18:58.491]  They want to hurt the earth.
[01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:00.655]  They're against Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus.
[01:19:01.296 --> 01:19:02.157]  They're holding us back.
[01:19:02.197 --> 01:19:03.820]  They caused all these bad things to happen.
[01:19:04.101 --> 01:19:06.626]  When these guys openly did it all and brag about it!
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:29.318]  ...end of this earth, and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass, that the lines of tribes shall soon dissolve, that as the world grows... But see, when he says the lines of tribes, they actually play groups off against each other.
[01:19:29.719 --> 01:19:32.882]  They mean world government stopping anybody having sovereignty.
[01:19:34.024 --> 01:19:40.147]  Our common humanity shall reveal itself and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.
[01:19:40.968 --> 01:19:41.908]  That means world government.
[01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:48.452]  To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward.
[01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:50.712]  Based on mutual interest.
[01:19:50.912 --> 01:19:52.333]  Did he say anything about Gaza?
[01:19:52.793 --> 01:19:59.537]  Is he saying anything about the thousands of people, tens of thousands, targeted under the Patriot Act and non-terror-related cases in prison right now?
[01:20:00.137 --> 01:20:02.278]  Is he saying anything about the... No, he's doing nothing.
[01:20:02.919 --> 01:20:03.539]  More lies.
[01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:05.160]  More false promises.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:05.800]  More betrayal.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:07.421]  Interest and mutual respect.
[01:20:08.782 --> 01:20:17.347]  To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build.
[01:20:18.328 --> 01:20:19.249]  Not what you destroy.
[01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:31.404]  Oh, as you put sanctions on them and as the US, the people that control the US, I don't want to be in that paradigm, stage terror attacks in Iran and do all of that?
[01:20:31.444 --> 01:20:32.545]  You mean that?
[01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:34.507]  And overthrow their country over and over again?
[01:20:34.527 --> 01:20:34.988]  You mean that?
[01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:37.251]  To those
[01:20:40.632 --> 01:20:45.379]  To those who claim to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent.
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:47.501]  Corruption and deceit?
[01:20:47.582 --> 01:20:48.302]  Blagojevich?
[01:20:51.303 --> 01:20:56.128]  The guy was going to have head up the Department of Commerce, Governor Bill Richardson having to step down.
[01:20:57.449 --> 01:21:02.154]  All these corrupt people in his administration, his new treasury head that he wants, doesn't pay taxes.
[01:21:02.534 --> 01:21:07.118]  It's big mafia Chicago, machine merged with the big foundations of the New World Order.
[01:21:07.639 --> 01:21:09.221]  Corruption, you're telling everybody...
[01:21:10.862 --> 01:21:11.703]  This is double speak.
[01:21:11.743 --> 01:21:16.127]  If his speech was about world unity, he would just say, I want to work with all of you in the world.
[01:21:16.167 --> 01:21:17.168]  We're all going to be friends.
[01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:18.550]  We're not going to attack you anymore.
[01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:20.812]  Instead it's, how dare you want division?
[01:21:20.872 --> 01:21:22.514]  How dare you cause all the problems?
[01:21:22.834 --> 01:21:24.115]  How dare you be corrupt?
[01:21:24.996 --> 01:21:28.820]  He's hyping everybody up to hate the rest of the world and go out and attack whoever he aims at.
[01:21:29.921 --> 01:21:34.222]  I mean, do you see the... I've never seen a speech with this much deception and evil.
[01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:38.803]  And when folks post this at PrisonPlanet.tv, it's live streaming right now, our analysis.
[01:21:38.903 --> 01:21:41.043]  I hope all of you make sure this video goes viral.
[01:21:41.483 --> 01:21:42.803]  It'll probably be 10, 15 parts.
[01:21:43.263 --> 01:21:45.004]  We're gonna come back, continue with this.
[01:21:45.704 --> 01:21:47.884]  We're about 80% through.
[01:21:48.164 --> 01:21:48.704]  Stay with us.
[01:21:48.724 --> 01:21:49.344]  This is key.
[01:21:52.245 --> 01:21:53.165]  We're on the march.
[01:21:53.645 --> 01:21:55.245]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:56.165 --> 01:21:58.866]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:02.071 --> 01:22:03.573]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:22:03.753 --> 01:22:05.214]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:22:05.515 --> 01:22:07.737]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:22:08.197 --> 01:22:12.942]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:22:13.322 --> 01:22:16.165]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[01:22:16.506 --> 01:22:19.989]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[01:22:20.416 --> 01:22:32.402]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:22:32.963 --> 01:22:34.964]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:22:34.984 --> 01:22:36.264]  I use one every day.
[01:22:36.705 --> 01:22:39.126]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:22:39.386 --> 01:22:39.947]  We're good.
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.941]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:23:03.961 --> 01:23:06.462]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:09.104]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:23:09.124 --> 01:23:10.304]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:23:10.324 --> 01:23:11.925]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:23:12.045 --> 01:23:14.866]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:23:14.926 --> 01:23:18.568]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:23:28.221 --> 01:23:33.010]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:34.192]  An inside job.
[01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:38.219]  How dare you?
[01:23:39.321 --> 01:23:44.365]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:23:44.385 --> 01:23:47.188]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:53.494]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:23:53.514 --> 01:23:56.337]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:23:56.617 --> 01:23:58.599]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:23:58.859 --> 01:24:01.342]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:24:01.883 --> 01:24:07.525]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:24:07.725 --> 01:24:12.867]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:24:13.147 --> 01:24:18.229]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:24:18.529 --> 01:24:22.090]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:24.091]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[01:24:24.432 --> 01:24:27.153]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[01:24:27.374 --> 01:24:30.416]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:24:30.656 --> 01:24:34.178]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:24:34.439 --> 01:24:38.982]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:24:39.262 --> 01:24:40.043]  Do your part.
[01:24:40.303 --> 01:24:42.564]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[01:24:58.601 --> 01:25:00.603]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:23.176]  For the last hour and thirty minutes, I've been going piece by piece through the lies, deception, twisting, semantical deception, mind control of Barack Obama's speech yesterday, seconds after he became the 44th President-elect.
[01:25:23.716 --> 01:25:25.677]  No longer elect, but in office.
[01:25:27.898 --> 01:25:30.199]  And just as we exposed Bill Clinton and George Bush and
[01:25:31.397 --> 01:25:34.078]  Barack Obama folks, they work for the same people, same agenda.
[01:25:34.458 --> 01:25:36.779]  We're going to continue that coming up in about ten minutes.
[01:25:37.319 --> 01:25:40.820]  We've got guests in studio coming up, and I've got a lot of other key news.
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:47.502]  But don't forget, it is the sponsors of this show that make this radio show slash simulcast TV transmission possible.
[01:25:47.962 --> 01:25:51.804]  It is the members of PrisonPlanet.tv that make it possible, and I want to thank you for that.
[01:25:52.244 --> 01:25:55.905]  Because the elitists need the people to join them and help them, because they know it is all about people power.
[01:25:56.405 --> 01:26:03.529]  Well, we are the David versus Goliath here, the leading light in the fight against the New World Order of thousands of great people out there taking action.
[01:26:03.949 --> 01:26:06.170]  Tens of millions taking action, but thousands prominently.
[01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:12.634]  So I want to thank you all for your support, and don't forget InfoWars.com and the online video bookstore, the great deals we've got on films.

[01:26:23.638 --> 01:26:26.859]  It also is effective tools to wake people up.
[01:26:26.879 --> 01:26:28.620]  Instead of talking to yourself blue in the face, give them a film.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:31.761]  So InfoWars.com, please go check it out today.
[01:26:32.002 --> 01:26:39.385]  Check out the online secure shopping cards and the books and videos available there at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:26:40.968 --> 01:26:46.714]  Speaking of sponsors, we have him on every month or so, and it's been about two months since we've had him on.
[01:26:46.955 --> 01:26:53.462]  And the reason I like this sponsor, and by my sponsors I mean people you hear me endorse, that's my sponsors, separate from the network sponsors.
[01:26:53.522 --> 01:26:57.686]  I'm not saying those are bad sponsors, it's just I haven't looked into them, I'm not endorsing them.
[01:26:58.968 --> 01:26:59.528]  This is a 48-year
[01:27:02.554 --> 01:27:06.097]  Well, they set it up in 1947, so I guess it's 57 years.
[01:27:07.258 --> 01:27:11.641]  When he got back from World War II, they set up a real soap company because they converted everything over to chemicals.
[01:27:12.822 --> 01:27:17.566]  The big chemical companies did, and they put soap businesses out of business.
[01:27:18.087 --> 01:27:27.034]  And since then, they've been selling to institutions, to government, to wealthy and others, even though it's very inexpensive, that are aware that what they call soap isn't soap.
[01:27:27.074 --> 01:27:31.258]  It's toxic detergent and chemicals and perfumes, which can mean thousands of additives.
[01:27:32.529 --> 01:27:40.732]  And so, by buying one of the original organic soap companies since 1947, that's 58 years.
[01:27:41.872 --> 01:27:43.153]  Man, that's a long time.
[01:27:43.173 --> 01:27:47.054]  He started with his dad, he runs it with his son, Marty Schachter.
[01:27:48.134 --> 01:27:50.795]  And it's 85% off supermarket prices.
[01:27:50.835 --> 01:27:58.698]  You get organic soap, which other places is normally twice the price of the big Procter & Gamble toxic waste stuff.
[01:27:59.798 --> 01:28:00.579]  Oh, it's been a year, Alex.
[01:28:00.659 --> 01:28:04.061]  It's a pleasure talking to you again and your listeners with so much to share.
[01:28:04.122 --> 01:28:04.742]  I just found out
[01:28:29.847 --> 01:28:34.210]  That Procter & Gamble is outsourcing their manufacturing in China.
[01:28:35.291 --> 01:28:38.253]  And we know how good the melamine is from China.
[01:28:38.993 --> 01:28:39.313]  Right.
[01:28:39.493 --> 01:28:42.335]  It's just 15 cents an hour in China.
[01:28:42.355 --> 01:28:56.965]  They're making your detergents that you're buying here and paying a fortune for it and being ripped off and getting your clothes deteriorating, getting your skin and your hair all burning and rashes and redness and itching.
[01:28:57.325 --> 01:28:58.406]  Don't need it anymore.
[01:28:58.908 --> 01:29:08.558]  I mean the world doesn't need another new all-purpose cleaner or another dish cleaner or laundry cleaner or bath cleaner.
[01:29:08.578 --> 01:29:15.625]  There's too many of them right now and we want to get back to good old-fashioned soap and not rip off the consumer.
[01:29:15.965 --> 01:29:21.906]  Marty, you've been a sponsor for 3 or 4 years now, and I want to get my math right.
[01:29:22.086 --> 01:29:27.808]  Actually, you guys have been around, I was just doing the math in my head, since 1947, that's 60 plus years.
[01:29:27.828 --> 01:29:28.648]  62 years.
[01:29:31.049 --> 01:29:40.971]  So I guess you've been a sponsor so long that I got 59 years in my head, 62 years going on 63 years that you guys have been in business.
[01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:43.190]  I've got old in the business, yes.
[01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:46.931]  Our slogan here is, our business is going down the drain.
[01:29:47.211 --> 01:29:52.432]  Well, Marty, the other big issue here is, you guys are 85% off supermarket prices.
[01:29:53.212 --> 01:29:54.552]  It's all made right here in the U.S.
[01:29:54.612 --> 01:29:57.673]  of A. Tell folks about what goes into your real soap.
[01:29:58.313 --> 01:30:03.214]  Well, we use vegetable oils and coconut oils into our products.
[01:30:03.234 --> 01:30:05.114]  We don't use waste petroleum.
[01:30:05.394 --> 01:30:08.435]  We don't use sodium chloride and all the other
[01:30:09.013 --> 01:30:14.398]  Chemicals that are doing more harm than good, deteriorating the clothing and burning the skin.
[01:30:14.718 --> 01:30:15.759]  Don't need it anymore.
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.662]  You've got to have this American choice.
[01:30:20.002 --> 01:30:22.925]  We're an American company making American products.
[01:30:24.086 --> 01:30:28.470]  All our people are Americans and we're very, very happy about that.
[01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:33.374]  And when we got the biggest sign in our warehouse here, Alex Jones.
[01:30:33.774 --> 01:30:35.175]  That's our God over here.
[01:30:37.188 --> 01:30:38.149]  Please don't say that.
[01:30:38.449 --> 01:30:39.871]  I'm not Barack Obama, please.
[01:30:43.154 --> 01:30:46.357]  You've done more for us than anybody in the last 62 years.
[01:30:47.668 --> 01:30:50.949]  We're talking about your endorsement has been gold.
[01:30:51.389 --> 01:31:04.993]  Well, until you came over to Genesis, you were only factory direct to big institutions, until one of the sales guys who used your products said, hey, you know, you guys need to advertise with Genesis, so we're glad you're going directly to the consumer now.
[01:31:05.333 --> 01:31:11.835]  Tell folks about your soap line, your real organic soap line, California Organic Certification, the highest standard.
[01:31:12.355 --> 01:31:15.896]  Four basic products that will do 200 jobs.
[01:31:16.396 --> 01:31:16.996]  Bath soap,
[01:31:17.489 --> 01:31:20.511]  Hair soap, dish soap, and laundry soap.
[01:31:20.931 --> 01:31:31.397]  And each one of those products are interchangeable, and they could do your all-purpose cleaning, doing your sweater wash, doing your floor cleaner, doing your window cleaner, all the cleaning things you need.
[01:31:31.698 --> 01:31:40.423]  We send you a book of instructions, data bulletins we call them, that not only tell you what the products are, but all the different uses of the product.
[01:31:40.934 --> 01:31:42.275]  Nothing like it in the country.
[01:31:42.555 --> 01:32:00.246]  There's nowhere, no how, that you could buy a year's supply for under $3 a week, or a three year supply for under $2.50 a week, or a four to five year supply, looking back, going forward to the future, for under $2 a week for everything.
[01:32:00.346 --> 01:32:02.287]  Bath soap, hair soap, dish soap, laundry soap.
[01:32:02.307 --> 01:32:07.831]  Now compare that to what the toxic chemical stuff they call soap at the store cost.
[01:32:08.812 --> 01:32:32.152]  Unfortunately, the store soap costs are costing you right now, and I've got variable statistical evidence to prove that an average family of four is spending, if they're spending, and this is a low number, $100 a week for all their steaks and fruits and vegetables and cleaners, well out of that $120 of that is going for cleaning chemicals.
[01:32:33.146 --> 01:32:37.287]  And that we're talking about knocking that $20 down to $2 to $3.
[01:32:37.568 --> 01:32:42.309]  That's over 85% savings and getting something twice as good.
[01:32:42.969 --> 01:32:45.991]  Twice as good as what you're using now and getting now.
[01:32:46.011 --> 01:32:49.052]  Well, I mean, it's all triple concentrate, but it's not even twice as good.
[01:32:49.312 --> 01:32:56.094]  When you walk through the chemical aisle, you know, the cleaning aisle, your eyes water, you feel sick, you get a headache.
[01:32:56.374 --> 01:32:58.675]  No, no, you need a respirator when you go through there.
[01:32:58.695 --> 01:33:05.159]  Well, I remember ever since I was a child, following along behind my mother, begging her to go to the toy aisle to buy me a bouncing ball or a cap gun.
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.701]  You know, just like, Mom, let's get out of this aisle.
[01:33:07.761 --> 01:33:08.802]  It's making my eyes water.
[01:33:09.082 --> 01:33:10.003]  Who doesn't remember that?
[01:33:10.283 --> 01:33:15.646]  Instead, you get stuffed with, you know, cherry essence, almond essence, all of this, your bar soap.
[01:33:15.726 --> 01:33:17.908]  We have them around the office and just smell them.
[01:33:17.948 --> 01:33:18.949]  It's just that smell.
[01:33:19.409 --> 01:33:21.470]  It just smells like food.
[01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:22.291]  You just want to eat it.
[01:33:22.971 --> 01:33:28.535]  Marty, give folks the toll-free number and tell them how to call to get a free brochure or to get the sampler tote bag.
[01:33:29.796 --> 01:33:29.976]  1-800-340-7091.
[01:33:30.216 --> 01:33:35.020]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[01:33:35.881 --> 01:33:42.467]  Or see us on the web, 5starsoap.com.
[01:33:43.047 --> 01:33:45.489]  5 the number or 5 the letter, makes no difference.
[01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:48.992]  We'll send you a free catalog, give you all this information.
[01:33:49.293 --> 01:33:55.398]  We have a special, on a one month supply, that'll last a family of four, anywhere from four to eight weeks.
[01:33:55.794 --> 01:34:10.666]  Of the four basic soaps, bath soap, air soap, dish soap, laundry soap, for you to use, and it's not for a day or a week, but for a month or two, and you'll get used to buying something and getting something that's two to three times better than what you're getting now.
[01:34:10.706 --> 01:34:12.427]  Yeah, folks, you know I wouldn't steer you wrong.
[01:34:12.467 --> 01:34:13.168]  Take the challenge.
[01:34:13.208 --> 01:34:15.469]  Call and purchase the Sampler Tote Bag.
[01:34:15.489 --> 01:34:16.831]  Tell them how much it is and how they get it.
[01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:19.032]  $20, a phone call.
[01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:21.034]  We ship it by United Parcel.
[01:34:21.642 --> 01:34:26.725]  Uh, depending, the cost depends on your zip code, because we don't know where you are.
[01:34:27.225 --> 01:34:30.246]  Sure, we understand.
[01:34:30.266 --> 01:34:33.288]  So tell folks the number.
[01:34:33.308 --> 01:34:33.588]  800-1-800-340-7091.
[01:34:33.988 --> 01:34:36.329]  We've got a whole family waiting here for your call.
[01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.910]  Where are you?
[01:34:39.611 --> 01:34:43.793]  We're talking about satisfaction guaranteed, or double your dirt back.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:47.122]  And the website is 5Starshope.com.
[01:34:47.142 --> 01:34:49.804]  The number one more time, Marty.
[01:34:49.824 --> 01:34:49.864]  800-340-7091.
[01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:54.247]  We're here for you.
[01:34:54.327 --> 01:34:55.008]  We'll help you.
[01:34:55.328 --> 01:34:56.209]  We'll encourage you.
[01:34:56.409 --> 01:34:57.310]  We'll clean you.
[01:34:57.650 --> 01:35:01.073]  And this is called bailout to you.
[01:35:01.113 --> 01:35:04.075]  We're going to bail you out from the junk signs you're getting now.
[01:35:04.355 --> 01:35:06.637]  We're going to give you an asset relief program.
[01:35:07.598 --> 01:35:10.260]  A financial rescue plan.
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.501]  Give us packages.
[01:35:11.881 --> 01:35:13.102]  Give us a limerick.
[01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:17.511]  Marty, give me a limerick.
[01:35:38.283 --> 01:35:39.244]  Amazing, my friend.
[01:35:39.264 --> 01:35:52.053]  Well, I want to get you back up, instead of every two months, I want to get you back up next week, because it's been a while, to specifically compare the ingredients in your products, you know, specifically as you've done years ago on the show, to what is in detergent and other chemicals.
[01:35:52.093 --> 01:35:53.214]  So let's do that next week.
[01:35:53.234 --> 01:35:54.194]  Marty, we'll talk to you soon.
[01:35:54.214 --> 01:35:59.098]  I look forward to it, and I'm very excited, and I very, very much appreciate your endorsing.
[01:35:59.349 --> 01:36:00.129]  We appreciate you.
[01:36:00.389 --> 01:36:01.330]  Why wouldn't I endorse it?
[01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:06.412]  Literally, the sales manager at Genesis, like five years ago, sends me a year's supply free from Marty.
[01:36:06.932 --> 01:36:07.913]  And I just forget about it.
[01:36:08.033 --> 01:36:08.933]  I'm not dealing with soap.
[01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:10.994]  My wife's already buying organic stuff, mainly at the store.
[01:36:11.014 --> 01:36:13.195]  It's like, what is this a year later when it ran out?
[01:36:13.495 --> 01:36:14.275]  I want more of this.
[01:36:14.956 --> 01:36:16.676]  And I went, yeah, it does smell good.
[01:36:16.716 --> 01:36:19.858]  And then I found out about it and went and got Marty as a sponsor myself.
[01:36:19.878 --> 01:36:20.738]  So that's how that happened.
[01:36:21.558 --> 01:36:24.660]  I want to get back into
[01:36:26.129 --> 01:36:38.719]  Barack Obama here before we have guests in studio next hour, but before I do that, I was noticing here in front of me, I hadn't seen this article yet.
[01:36:40.228 --> 01:36:42.530]  CFR boss Richard Haass on Colbert.
[01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:58.800]  Now earlier in the hour I was talking about how he said in the article that they wrote, that Paul Watson wrote a story about last year and linked to, where he said we're going to use the war to save the earth as a way to make humans the enemy so the state can organize and control people, and terror, fake terror.
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:03.403]  And I saw him at Bilderberg, he came out mad when I was bullhorning him earlier last year.
[01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:06.610]  And here he is on the Colbert.
[01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:12.553]  Understand, ten years ago, twelve years ago, I would say the CFR, Globalist, here's their documents, they want to set up world government.
[01:37:12.573 --> 01:37:24.480]  They're using Globalism to bankrupt the US, they're going to implode the economy through a banking crisis and bring in a world regulatory banking system, which is now being announced and in the news, not because I'm smart, because I read what they said they'd do.
[01:37:24.901 --> 01:37:25.861]  But that wasn't on the news.
[01:37:26.141 --> 01:37:30.604]  And Limbaugh would get on air and say it doesn't exist, and the CFR doesn't even exist.
[01:37:30.664 --> 01:37:33.546]  Now, they're suddenly all over TV, pushing their agenda,
[01:37:34.566 --> 01:37:37.571]  Because by acting secret, we were able to expose them.
[01:37:37.591 --> 01:37:38.432]  Now they're trying to counter.
[01:37:38.452 --> 01:37:41.035]  They know by remaining silent, we really exposed them.
[01:37:46.291 --> 01:37:48.112]  Listen to the Co-Bear Nation.
[01:37:48.172 --> 01:37:54.654]  Richard Haass believes this century has the potential for America to cooperate with other countries to make the world safer, says Co-Bear Nation.
[01:37:54.874 --> 01:37:59.356]  Richard N. Haass is president of the Council of Foreign Relations, a position he has held since July 2003.
[01:37:59.416 --> 01:38:04.138]  That's in the News and Focus section of InfoWars.com.
[01:38:06.337 --> 01:38:09.078]  Guys, the headline is CFR Boss Richard N. Haas on Colbert.
[01:38:09.959 --> 01:38:10.919]  It's a video of it.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:13.561]  I don't have it on my computer over here where I can play it.
[01:38:14.721 --> 01:38:17.002]  Because people are still out there saying CFR doesn't exist.
[01:38:17.083 --> 01:38:21.685]  Right now I listen because they hear Limbaugh say it all those years and they can't believe he'd lie to them.
[01:38:22.768 --> 01:38:23.689]  Just, it's incredible.
[01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:26.130]  And they go in and basically push world government.
[01:38:26.190 --> 01:38:30.011]  Just like when they had Vicente Fox on that show, and he said, yeah, we're in North American Union.
[01:38:30.052 --> 01:38:31.132]  People said, oh, that's just a joke.
[01:38:31.332 --> 01:38:32.693]  Then he said it on Larry King Live.
[01:38:32.893 --> 01:38:36.054]  Then he said it to We Are Change Cameras, and it's in our film, Truth Rising.
[01:38:40.036 --> 01:38:40.456]  You know what?
[01:38:40.737 --> 01:38:41.757]  Just go back to Obama.
[01:38:42.137 --> 01:38:43.658]  It's up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:38:43.678 --> 01:38:44.818]  If people want to watch it, they can.
[01:38:44.918 --> 01:38:46.159]  I'll play it tomorrow if I have time.
[01:38:46.179 --> 01:38:47.860]  Are our guests here yet?
[01:38:50.029 --> 01:38:55.395]  Because I know they're going to be in studio the last hour, and they even put out a press release about it, so I want to... They're probably banging on the door or something.
[01:38:56.216 --> 01:39:03.223]  Okay, let's go back to the... We're now going to go back to analyzing Barack Obama that we did in the first hour and a half.
[01:39:03.704 --> 01:39:04.244]  So here we go.
[01:39:04.845 --> 01:39:11.893]  Know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.
[01:39:14.181 --> 01:39:20.346]  That means to Iran and everybody else, to exactly what the UN says, let the world government run all your countries, rogue nations, i.e.
[01:39:20.386 --> 01:39:22.928]  nations that aren't under their control, whether they're good, bad, or indifferent.
[01:39:23.128 --> 01:39:24.670]  We're not saying what these countries are.
[01:39:24.690 --> 01:39:27.372]  We're not judging them as the good guys and the globalists the bad guys.
[01:39:27.552 --> 01:39:28.633]  They're all pretty much bad guys.
[01:39:29.093 --> 01:39:35.098]  The point here is, is that, you know, you do what we say and then we'll, we'll rule you.
[01:39:35.578 --> 01:39:36.619]  Or, you're gonna get it.
[01:39:39.502 --> 01:39:40.923]  To the people of poor nations,
[01:39:41.994 --> 01:39:46.155]  We pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow.
[01:39:46.536 --> 01:39:52.678]  Yeah, that means force in genetically modified foods at the IMF and World Bank and United Nations World Health Organization.
[01:39:52.698 --> 01:39:59.380]  The forced sterilizations, the inoculations, the villagers all over Asia, Africa, Latin America run when the UN trucks come with shots.
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.361]  They pay the local governments to hold them at machine gun point and inject them.
[01:40:02.981 --> 01:40:05.082]  The women that have babies spontaneously abort.
[01:40:05.322 --> 01:40:06.783]  It's all on record, mainstream news.
[01:40:07.483 --> 01:40:10.526]  That's the help that's coming with the food of the third world.
[01:40:10.786 --> 01:40:12.307]  We have State Department of Random 200.
[01:40:13.088 --> 01:40:14.569]  We have the Club of Rome documents.
[01:40:14.909 --> 01:40:20.614]  We have the Royal Commission on Population, where the governments of the world admit they're really exterminating these third world populations.
[01:40:21.274 --> 01:40:23.997]  To nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.
[01:40:25.358 --> 01:40:33.585]  And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders.
[01:40:34.178 --> 01:40:42.700]  Now what that means is doubling and tripling, UNICEF and the UN, IMF and World Bank funding some more of our tax money going to carry out the eugenics operations in the name of saving the children.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:47.881]  Nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect.
[01:40:49.221 --> 01:40:50.421]  For the world has changed.
[01:40:51.402 --> 01:40:52.462]  And we must change with it.
[01:40:54.522 --> 01:40:56.283]  Yeah, the bankers are bringing in the world government.
[01:40:56.303 --> 01:40:56.963]  It has changed.
[01:40:56.983 --> 01:40:58.383]  And we must change with it.
[01:40:58.443 --> 01:40:59.623]  We've got to be futuristic.
[01:40:59.663 --> 01:41:01.904]  We've got to do what they say.
[01:41:05.632 --> 01:41:11.395]  As we consider the world that unfolds before us, we will remember with humble gratitude.
[01:41:11.875 --> 01:41:13.156]  The world that unfolds.
[01:41:13.176 --> 01:41:15.457]  These guys have engineered the hellhole we're going into.
[01:41:15.477 --> 01:41:17.258]  But it's like, oh, it's unfolding.
[01:41:17.298 --> 01:41:18.219]  We got to go into the future.
[01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:24.822]  Those brave Americans who at this very hour patrol far off deserts and distant mountains.
[01:41:24.842 --> 01:41:29.745]  See, so he ties looking to the future, being optimistic with the troops in all these evil wars.
[01:41:31.331 --> 01:41:32.953]  Again, we're not even attacking those individual troops.
[01:41:32.993 --> 01:41:34.134]  It's that these wars are evil.
[01:41:34.174 --> 01:41:41.481]  Three million dead Iraqis, a million and a half just since the five and a half year occupation, a million and a half before that, in the siege known as the sanctions.
[01:41:44.904 --> 01:41:45.885]  That's something to tell us.
[01:41:47.130 --> 01:41:50.592]  Just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages.
[01:41:51.852 --> 01:42:01.397]  See, now if you're not for Obama, you're against those that lie in Arlington, all those little white crosses, all those tombstones, all those stars of David, all those crescents, all those dead Americans.
[01:42:01.717 --> 01:42:04.959]  They're out there in Arlington and you get with my agenda or you're against them.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:14.584]  You know, you get with the troops fighting overseas or you're against the dead who supposedly fought for liberty and freedom, but they've set up a tyranny in Iraq.
[01:42:16.311 --> 01:42:22.017]  We honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because the guardians of our liberty.
[01:42:22.038 --> 01:42:23.259]  They're announcing they're going to use the U.S.
[01:42:23.299 --> 01:42:32.029]  military against the American people to suppress the population while the government does everything that's diametrically opposed to the people's will, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence.
[01:42:32.649 --> 01:42:34.592]  They embody the spirit of service.
[01:42:36.487 --> 01:42:40.049]  Now we're getting into the spirit of service.
[01:42:40.069 --> 01:42:41.410]  Get everybody hyped up.
[01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:46.513]  Talk about soup kitchens that bait and switch with forced domestic military force.
[01:42:47.133 --> 01:42:48.974]  Little yuppies don't want to go out and fight overseas.
[01:42:48.994 --> 01:42:50.015]  They'll be suppressing you.
[01:42:50.355 --> 01:42:56.139]  All the Eddie Haskells, all the control freaks, all the know-it-alls running your life on every corner.
[01:42:56.259 --> 01:42:58.540]  Little secret police commissar pimps.
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:00.061]  They're openly setting it up.
[01:43:01.843 --> 01:43:04.885]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:43:05.326 --> 01:43:08.628]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:43:09.108 --> 01:43:15.052]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:43:15.413 --> 01:43:19.556]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:43:20.056 --> 01:43:25.780]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:29.082]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:31.780]  We're good.
[01:43:52.836 --> 01:43:57.040]  Call 877-327-0365.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:58.522]  877-327-0365.
[01:43:59.963 --> 01:44:00.564]  Don't wait.
[01:44:00.644 --> 01:44:01.305]  Call today.
[01:44:01.325 --> 01:44:05.048]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:44:05.128 --> 01:44:08.232]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:44:08.612 --> 01:44:10.274]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:44:11.229 --> 01:44:12.270]  But who is the enemy?
[01:44:12.791 --> 01:44:13.271]  Bin Laden.
[01:44:13.592 --> 01:44:14.573]  This is his M.O.
[01:44:14.593 --> 01:44:15.895]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:44:15.955 --> 01:44:17.617]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:44:17.957 --> 01:44:24.705]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:44:25.105 --> 01:44:25.546]  Some U.S.
[01:44:25.586 --> 01:44:31.233]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:44:31.913 --> 01:44:35.415]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:44:35.435 --> 01:44:38.416]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:45:02.349 --> 01:45:06.090]  Do you have aches and pains or suffer from indigestion or inflammation?
[01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:08.771]  Are you tired of feeling restless from insomnia?
[01:45:09.111 --> 01:45:16.133]  These symptoms are produced by negative toxins, but with the correct information, understanding, and care, you can cleanse them from your body.
[01:45:16.454 --> 01:45:21.495]  Allomaster.com would like to help you begin the road to recovery with aloe vera.
[01:45:21.615 --> 01:45:30.298]  For over 4,000 years, aloe vera has been known for its therapeutic and healing properties and is widely recognized as the plant that helps alleviate minor burns.
[01:45:30.738 --> 01:45:38.942]  Allomaster.com picks the best aloe leaves and produces the most potent aloe vera concentrated juices and freeze-dried capsules you can find.

[01:45:47.225 --> 01:45:50.651]  Turn over a new leaf and visit us today at alomaster.com.
[01:45:50.771 --> 01:45:52.975]  That's A-L-O-E, master.com.
[01:45:53.175 --> 01:45:54.157]  Or call us at 1-800-934-ALLO.
[01:45:54.177 --> 01:45:54.698]  That's 1-800-934-2563 today!
[01:46:04.031 --> 01:46:07.613]  Alright, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to play the rest of his speech and then come back.
[01:46:07.633 --> 01:46:12.255]  I'm going to write some notes and I'll comment on the points he made here in the last few minutes.
[01:46:12.876 --> 01:46:14.236]  Back to Barack Obama.
[01:46:14.917 --> 01:46:17.278]  To find meaning in something greater than themselves.
[01:46:19.879 --> 01:46:20.900]  I'm sorry I can't help it.
[01:46:21.781 --> 01:46:23.822]  Again, he said it 50 times if he didn't say it 100.
[01:46:26.997 --> 01:46:31.659]  And yet, at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.
[01:46:55.345 --> 01:46:57.766]  A spirit must inhabit us all.
[01:46:58.886 --> 01:47:04.508]  So he's invoking a new religion of worshipping government, bringing in the new world order, the new age, that he already said three times.
[01:47:05.948 --> 01:47:12.991]  For as much as government can do, and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people.
[01:47:13.411 --> 01:47:14.971]  See, this is a twisting.
[01:47:15.371 --> 01:47:17.632]  He says we're individualistic, but we gotta have a big government.
[01:47:18.112 --> 01:47:19.993]  He then says we're all in this together collectively.
[01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:23.733]  He then says, but government can't do it all, you've got to do it.
[01:47:23.793 --> 01:47:29.378]  Which is a true message, but that means the people getting behind the evil and being suckered into accepting it.
[01:47:29.478 --> 01:47:31.019]  I mean, this is so twisted.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:32.421]  Which this nation relies.
[01:47:33.922 --> 01:47:36.765]  It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break.
[01:47:37.465 --> 01:47:38.366]  The selflessness.
[01:47:38.686 --> 01:47:46.293]  See, just like they start all this with soup kitchens and helping build levees, all sounds reasonable, but really it's secret police, tattletale squads, environmental squads.
[01:47:47.173 --> 01:47:52.716]  ...of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job, which sees us through our darkest hours.
[01:47:54.197 --> 01:47:58.319]  It is the firefighter's courage... See, cut your hours.
[01:47:58.599 --> 01:47:59.780]  Don't make as much money.
[01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:03.002]  Now, that has nothing to do with doing it for a co-worker.
[01:48:03.062 --> 01:48:04.002]  People are going to lose their jobs.
[01:48:04.022 --> 01:48:06.263]  It's going to get worse because of what his banker masters have done.
[01:48:06.623 --> 01:48:08.204]  The New World Order engineers, the architects.
[01:48:08.645 --> 01:48:10.045]  But he's making that a beautiful thing.
[01:48:10.546 --> 01:48:11.506]  You did it for America.
[01:48:11.546 --> 01:48:12.427]  You lost your job.
[01:48:12.847 --> 01:48:14.728]  You trained that foreigner that's replacing you.
[01:48:16.331 --> 01:48:17.031]  For America.
[01:48:17.452 --> 01:48:17.892]  You did it.
[01:48:18.872 --> 01:48:25.415]  ...to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's will... See, then he mixed giving up your job with being a firefighter.
[01:48:26.035 --> 01:48:27.176]  Everybody's for saving children.
[01:48:27.536 --> 01:48:29.076]  Firefighters are incredibly brave, we love them.
[01:48:29.457 --> 01:48:35.079]  But he's, with their reflected glory, just like Bush on top of the pile with a bullhorn, it made him the hero.
[01:48:36.159 --> 01:48:36.500]  You see?
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:38.020]  Same sick thing.
[01:48:38.561 --> 01:48:41.802]  ...to nurture a child that finally decides our fate.
[01:48:46.129 --> 01:48:50.011]  See now, a fireman, you know, helping children, doing all of that.
[01:48:50.031 --> 01:48:53.914]  See he's saying American values, what we are, but we're doing something new.
[01:49:08.819 --> 01:49:13.561]  All the criminals you've got running your administration?
[01:49:13.841 --> 01:49:21.284]  So he's saying, government's there to take all your tax money and give it to offshore banks, and then you're gonna get nothing, and then volunteer forcibly, like slaves in the Soviet Union.
[01:49:22.144 --> 01:49:23.044]  These things are old.
[01:49:23.064 --> 01:49:23.785]  These things are true.
[01:49:37.179 --> 01:49:39.960]  They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history.
[01:49:41.981 --> 01:49:44.982]  What is demanded then is a return to these troops.
[01:49:46.563 --> 01:49:49.244]  So he's saying we're going to do something new, but it's really the old.
[01:49:49.924 --> 01:49:52.605]  It's patriotism, it's dead soldiers, it's firefighters.
[01:49:53.005 --> 01:49:56.006]  Now, let the bankers take over, we're going to use NORTHCOM against you.
[01:49:57.106 --> 01:50:00.828]  What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility.
[01:50:02.068 --> 01:50:07.732]  A recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world.
[01:50:08.333 --> 01:50:21.422]  They're getting you ready for a regular army draft, a one-million-person domestic security force, and then separate Obama's own private army running in government PSAs everywhere, usaservice.org.
[01:50:22.483 --> 01:50:26.746]  Private Army, under his control, government armies, and what?
[01:50:26.766 --> 01:50:27.806]  You're not for service?
[01:50:27.847 --> 01:50:30.268]  You're the ones holding back us fixing this country!
[01:50:30.728 --> 01:50:31.409]  You're the one!
[01:50:31.449 --> 01:50:32.710]  You've caused all this!
[01:50:32.730 --> 01:50:37.633]  We're going to come back and finish up with this, and then at the 8 after, we're going to have guests in studio.
[01:50:37.993 --> 01:50:40.675]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[01:50:43.276 --> 01:50:45.098]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:46.539 --> 01:50:48.500]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:51.715 --> 01:50:53.276]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:53.396 --> 01:50:58.059]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:58.139 --> 01:51:00.900]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:03.982]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:04.142 --> 01:51:08.865]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:09.085 --> 01:51:10.026]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:10.226 --> 01:51:13.148]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:13.468 --> 01:51:20.354]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:51:20.454 --> 01:51:23.576]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:51:23.736 --> 01:51:25.277]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:34.946]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:51:35.146 --> 01:51:38.890]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:40.252]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:51:40.272 --> 01:51:40.852]  Take action today.
[01:51:40.892 --> 01:51:42.714]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:51:54.497 --> 01:51:56.399]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:59.603]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:15.916 --> 01:52:22.741]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have Barry Cooper, never get busted filmmaker, in studio coming up with us at the 8 after.
[01:52:23.682 --> 01:52:28.826]  We may even do some overdrive today, so we have time to take some of your phone calls.
[01:52:30.626 --> 01:52:44.853]  But I need to finish up here with Barack Obama and his most deceptive, manipulative, scientifically crafted speech I have ever seen that was written by the technocrats, the psych warfare experts, for him.
[01:52:44.873 --> 01:52:45.433]  So here it is.
[01:52:45.813 --> 01:52:49.155]  Duties that we do not grudgingly accept, but rather seize gladly.
[01:52:49.895 --> 01:52:55.038]  Remember what Aldous Huxley said about how people can be made to love their servitude?
[01:52:55.618 --> 01:52:57.059]  In fact, come in with that audio.
[01:52:58.456 --> 01:53:01.119]  And with Walter Cronkite talking about world government and how great it is.
[01:53:01.159 --> 01:53:01.699]  Come in with that.
[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:04.322]  When we come back in the next segment, we're going to play that little piece.
[01:53:05.283 --> 01:53:08.887]  With Aldous Huxley saying people can be made to love their servitude and slavery.
[01:53:09.188 --> 01:53:17.056]  Oh, you don't grudgingly become a slave of the government and not just pay taxes to save America from the bankers that have engineered this, but you love it.
[01:53:17.833 --> 01:53:18.974]  You love your slavery.
[01:53:19.294 --> 01:53:23.217]  And then the people that are all drinking the Kool-Aid, they're going to say, it's our fault.
[01:53:23.257 --> 01:53:24.098]  He already said that in the speech.
[01:53:24.518 --> 01:53:28.061]  If we don't do everything he says, it's our fault things are going to get bad.
[01:53:28.441 --> 01:53:31.223]  He's our dear leader, Mao Tse-Tung Barack Obama.
[01:53:31.403 --> 01:53:36.968]  In the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character,
[01:53:37.708 --> 01:53:39.589]  Been giving our all to a difficult task.
[01:53:40.109 --> 01:53:40.589]  That's right.
[01:53:40.729 --> 01:53:42.290]  Truly fighting the New World Order.
[01:53:42.590 --> 01:53:44.111]  Truly fighting the police state.
[01:53:44.451 --> 01:53:49.433]  Truly fighting the corrupt police who've been caught all over the nation thousands of times per state.
[01:53:50.093 --> 01:53:51.433]  In Houston, 4,000 times.
[01:53:51.533 --> 01:53:55.475]  Plus, Houston Chronicle, setting people up who were innocent, planting drugs on them.
[01:53:56.055 --> 01:53:58.136]  You know, things like that we're going to be talking about coming up.
[01:53:59.093 --> 01:54:11.319]  You know, not being told you're patriotic and a great hero because the media and the culture tell you because you serve their New World Order, but actually being real heroes and fighting you and the people that control you and George Bush and the rest of them.
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:17.361]  This is the price and the promise of citizenship.
[01:54:18.742 --> 01:54:21.523]  This, this is the promise and the price.
[01:54:22.364 --> 01:54:24.945]  I thought I was born an American free of the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[01:54:24.985 --> 01:54:26.826]  No, I got to work as a slave.
[01:54:28.396 --> 01:54:32.259]  To earn my citizenship so I can be slapped around by his corrupt thugs.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:35.361]  Is the source of our confidence.
[01:54:36.101 --> 01:54:39.344]  The knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.
[01:54:40.424 --> 01:54:40.965]  See what he said?
[01:54:41.105 --> 01:54:45.908]  You become a slave, you do what they say, and then you'll have confidence that the economy will get better.
[01:54:46.549 --> 01:54:50.892]  You do what we say, and any of you that don't go along with it, you cause the problem.
[01:54:52.495 --> 01:54:58.299]  This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed why men and women and children... The meaning of our liberty?
[01:54:58.359 --> 01:55:02.581]  I guess work is freedom and war is peace and freedom is slavery.
[01:55:02.801 --> 01:55:05.983]  I mean, this is our creed to be forced to work for the government?
[01:55:06.684 --> 01:55:07.504]  This is our creed?
[01:55:08.185 --> 01:55:10.106]  Youth Brigades, this is what America is?
[01:55:11.487 --> 01:55:16.370]  ...of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall.
[01:55:18.359 --> 01:55:28.687]  And why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.
[01:55:40.976 --> 01:55:47.782]  So let us mark today a remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled.
[01:55:48.553 --> 01:55:55.938]  See, it's all about we, we, we, we together, which would be great if this was a true leader, a good government, but it's a bankrupt, hijacked government by foreign bankers.
[01:55:55.998 --> 01:55:57.399]  It's all Borg thought.
[01:55:57.519 --> 01:55:59.200]  We, we, collectivism.
[01:56:01.121 --> 01:56:10.207]  In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river.
[01:56:11.468 --> 01:56:12.589]  The capital was abandoned.
[01:56:13.389 --> 01:56:14.970]  The enemy was advancing.
[01:56:15.491 --> 01:56:17.032]  The snow was stained with blood.
[01:56:18.294 --> 01:56:19.175]  And who is the enemy?
[01:56:19.355 --> 01:56:22.379]  It's the American people, it's liberty, it's freedom, it's anti-globalist.
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:32.850]  And he's comparing what the New World Order is doing to Washington crossing the Delaware in the dead of night and going to Trenton, New Jersey and defeating the German Hessian mercenaries.
[01:56:34.232 --> 01:56:34.873]  The globalist.
[01:56:36.212 --> 01:56:36.392]  No.
[01:56:36.892 --> 01:56:39.013]  You, Barack Obama, are the German mercenaries.
[01:56:39.174 --> 01:56:40.254]  You are the Hessians.
[01:56:40.554 --> 01:56:41.595]  You are the Redcoats.
[01:56:41.875 --> 01:56:43.015]  You are the New World Order.
[01:56:43.276 --> 01:56:49.419]  You are the Imperium and the American people desperately fighting you and freedom lovers worldwide fighting collectivism and globalism.
[01:56:49.779 --> 01:56:52.720]  We're the people, a ragtag band, crossing the Delaware.
[01:56:52.941 --> 01:56:59.444]  You're the well-formed big army, all in the swarms, snug cabins in Trenton, New Jersey.
[01:57:02.173 --> 01:57:06.454]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:57:06.694 --> 01:57:11.596]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:57:11.796 --> 01:57:13.116]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:57:13.296 --> 01:57:16.777]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:58:01.956 --> 01:58:08.285]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:08.665 --> 01:58:10.348]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:11.283 --> 01:58:12.304]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:12.824 --> 01:58:13.324]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:13.624 --> 01:58:14.605]  This is his M.O.
[01:58:14.625 --> 01:58:15.965]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:58:15.985 --> 01:58:17.646]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:58:17.986 --> 01:58:24.750]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:58:25.130 --> 01:58:25.570]  Some U.S.
[01:58:25.610 --> 01:58:31.253]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:58:31.953 --> 01:58:35.475]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:58:35.855 --> 01:58:45.700]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:46.680]  Fabled enemies.
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:54.424]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:54.924 --> 01:58:58.286]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.

[01:59:29.810 --> 01:59:30.730]  We're good to go.
[01:59:56.561 --> 01:59:57.181]  1-800-234-8654.
[01:59:57.241 --> 01:59:59.483]  That's 1-800-234-8654.
[02:00:02.544 --> 02:00:17.232]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[02:00:17.292 --> 02:00:21.734]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which
[02:00:22.648 --> 02:00:26.349]  By any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[02:00:26.849 --> 02:00:28.669]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:00:32.410 --> 02:00:34.230]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:00:37.991 --> 02:00:39.772]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:00:43.132 --> 02:00:46.033]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[02:00:46.313 --> 02:00:48.513]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[02:00:48.633 --> 02:00:51.114]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:00:53.283 --> 02:00:59.267]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[02:00:59.627 --> 02:01:06.412]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:01:06.532 --> 02:01:11.496]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[02:01:11.516 --> 02:01:14.398]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[02:01:14.458 --> 02:01:18.661]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[02:01:18.741 --> 02:01:21.703]  We have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:26.933]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[02:01:27.053 --> 02:01:27.814]  Well, join me.
[02:01:28.354 --> 02:01:30.496]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[02:01:30.736 --> 02:01:32.558]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:01:34.099 --> 02:01:40.584]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:01:50.313 --> 02:01:56.278]  Alright, there you heard one of the top mind control technicians saying they can teach you to love your enslavement.
[02:01:56.418 --> 02:01:57.599]  Love the evil you do.
[02:01:58.119 --> 02:01:59.740]  Love the tyranny you put up with.
[02:02:02.483 --> 02:02:05.525]  You just heard national news saying mercury's good for children's brains.
[02:02:06.326 --> 02:02:07.306]  Poison's good for them.
[02:02:08.387 --> 02:02:11.430]  The government secretly tests lethal agents on the American people.
[02:02:11.950 --> 02:02:13.111]  Telling you it's all good.
[02:02:14.012 --> 02:02:15.633]  Telling you they want world government.
[02:02:17.196 --> 02:02:23.517]  And the way they originally set up their police state was by engineering prohibition of alcohol so that they could come in...
[02:02:24.929 --> 02:02:28.352]  Corrupt the police, expand federal police, take control of local police.
[02:02:28.672 --> 02:02:32.215]  When that ended, they created prohibition on narcotics.
[02:02:33.056 --> 02:02:36.338]  But that wasn't enough, because a lot of people didn't use those, and they were sold in the stores.
[02:02:36.358 --> 02:02:37.099]  People didn't even use them.
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:41.463]  You can buy heroin, cocaine, anything at your local pharmacy.
[02:02:41.543 --> 02:02:42.644]  Coca-Cola had cocaine in it.
[02:02:42.884 --> 02:02:49.009]  They made that illegal, but people weren't using that yet, even though the police and everybody were selling them and getting them going in the black communities was the first beta test.
[02:02:49.409 --> 02:02:52.212]  So they made marijuana illegal because there were some people using that.
[02:02:52.232 --> 02:02:56.697]  They'd give you 20, 30 years in prison back in the 40s, 50s, 60s for marijuana.
[02:02:58.099 --> 02:03:03.465]  And just like they built this big police state in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, now they're shifting the phony drug war.
[02:03:04.506 --> 02:03:07.308]  And the war on terror on the American people and saying that.
[02:03:07.528 --> 02:03:08.948]  So finishing up with Barack Obama.
[02:03:08.968 --> 02:03:14.091]  We will go into overdrive today with the maker of two great films that we're actually carrying at Infowars.com.
[02:03:14.111 --> 02:03:15.452]  Barry Cooper's Never Get Busted Again.
[02:03:16.092 --> 02:03:19.554]  So we'll be talking about that with him as well today.
[02:03:19.594 --> 02:03:23.576]  But I wanted to finish up with Barack Obama and the incredible mind control.
[02:03:23.596 --> 02:03:29.439]  They're trying to create this massive hype where nobody will say they don't like him because he's so great and he's so good.
[02:03:29.479 --> 02:03:32.661]  And my God, he'll fix everything if we just go along with him.
[02:03:32.681 --> 02:03:33.201]  So here it is.
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:42.942]  At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people.
[02:03:45.203 --> 02:03:57.567]  Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it.
[02:04:01.553 --> 02:04:09.323]  In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words.
[02:04:10.665 --> 02:04:16.632]  With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come.
[02:04:17.725 --> 02:04:23.370]  Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested, we refused to let this journey end.
[02:04:23.991 --> 02:04:26.353]  That we did not turn back, nor did we falter.
[02:04:26.933 --> 02:04:36.482]  And with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.
[02:04:37.203 --> 02:04:37.603]  Thank you.
[02:04:38.244 --> 02:04:38.965]  God bless you.
[02:04:39.665 --> 02:04:41.507]  And God bless the United States of America.
[02:04:44.212 --> 02:04:46.853]  Which he is a globalist attempting to take down.
[02:04:46.893 --> 02:04:47.893]  I'll say this to you, Obama.
[02:04:48.174 --> 02:04:56.857]  Quoting George Washington, they're about to cross the dangerous Delaware and then march all night with a bunch of men freezing to death through the forest hills and paths.
[02:04:57.917 --> 02:05:04.780]  And then to engage a much larger force of German mercenary troops, Hessians, at Trenton.
[02:05:07.113 --> 02:05:08.574]  And that is back at you, buddy.
[02:05:09.134 --> 02:05:09.715]  Back at you.
[02:05:09.755 --> 02:05:11.196]  We're going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:05:11.216 --> 02:05:13.818]  You're just a front man and we know that and we see right through you.
[02:05:14.038 --> 02:05:16.280]  Just like we saw through Bill Clinton and George Bush.
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:19.842]  You're all carrying the same evil ball for the New World Order.
[02:05:20.703 --> 02:05:22.104]  We know you're carrying out eugenics.
[02:05:22.144 --> 02:05:28.348]  We know you just doubled the eugenics funding to exterminate and force abortion in China and India and Africa.
[02:05:29.029 --> 02:05:30.570]  We know you're involved in all these evils.
[02:05:30.590 --> 02:05:32.191]  We know you're a betrayer of nations.
[02:05:32.231 --> 02:05:33.052]  We know you're wicked.
[02:05:33.812 --> 02:05:38.634]  They gave us this boob, this idiot Bush to carry out all this crime, the agenda, knowing people would hate him.
[02:05:38.954 --> 02:05:45.296]  Now they bring you the Savior, who in the fine print is intensifying all the things that George Bush did.
[02:05:45.737 --> 02:05:46.917]  And notice it hasn't been kosher.
[02:05:47.557 --> 02:05:48.658]  It hasn't been acceptable.
[02:05:49.098 --> 02:05:50.939]  It hasn't been something that you're allowed to talk about.
[02:05:50.959 --> 02:05:58.942]  Remember ten years ago when having an American flag out front of your house was weird, and they had TV shows where people that had American flags were terrorists, and they taught police that was a sign of being bad?
[02:05:59.682 --> 02:06:02.966]  Then after they staged 9-11, it was okay to come out and talk about the flag again.
[02:06:02.986 --> 02:06:05.809]  And now, they haven't been quoting George Washington in decades.
[02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:07.511]  Suddenly, George Washington's back!
[02:06:08.171 --> 02:06:17.382]  This is a revolution, but it is a revolution by the elite against the people, posing as a grassroots revolution, because they've got to fool the people long enough to get this agenda done.
[02:06:18.911 --> 02:06:28.997]  So it took about two hours of air time for me to play that 21 minute 18 second clip and to go through each lie and each deception and give you the facts and the documents.
[02:06:29.557 --> 02:06:33.640]  Henry Kissinger is on TV saying Barack Obama is basically the world president.
[02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:36.161]  He's going to carry the ball to set up the New World Order.
[02:06:36.542 --> 02:06:43.026]  And when you go look at what Henry Kissinger and the Trilateral Commission and CFR say the New World Order is, it is the destruction of private property and local liberty.
[02:06:43.406 --> 02:06:46.768]  It is world tyranny run by the bankers and paying carbon taxes directly to them.
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:49.140]  It is troops on the streets.
[02:06:49.861 --> 02:06:51.081]  It is war against humanity.
[02:06:51.641 --> 02:06:58.864]  It is the parasite class scientifically feeding on the population and getting the population to love their servitude.
[02:06:59.944 --> 02:07:02.825]  So I will tell you again, ladies and gentlemen, we need your support more than ever.
[02:07:02.845 --> 02:07:03.825]  We're trying to expand.
[02:07:03.845 --> 02:07:08.627]  I'm going to be adding some more shows into the studio I've built here very soon.
[02:07:08.647 --> 02:07:14.109]  I will let you know that, that we're going to have another weeknight show Monday through Friday here in the next month.
[02:07:14.889 --> 02:07:17.211]  Also going to have some weekend shows we're going to be bringing in.
[02:07:17.231 --> 02:07:21.095]  I haven't even told Bob Dacey yet, but I'm going to offer him a weekend show.
[02:07:21.636 --> 02:07:22.817]  I'm hiring the board operators.
[02:07:22.877 --> 02:07:28.122]  I'm hiring all the people right now to expand what you could call the InfoWars network.
[02:07:28.142 --> 02:07:30.104]  You know, I haven't intended to do a full-born network.
[02:07:32.566 --> 02:07:36.228]  People gave me the idea, saying I was setting up a network, that I ought to do that.
[02:07:36.929 --> 02:07:39.590]  But I have no intention to do a 24-hour a day network.
[02:07:39.610 --> 02:07:53.478]  I'm going to do it in association with Ted Anderson, because his space and his studios in Minnesota are filled, to just bring in maybe two or three, four really good shows, truly diverse shows, different angles for Liberty onto the airwaves here.
[02:07:53.918 --> 02:08:00.982]  And then Ted Anderson is leasing an ABC News Star Guide feed to get our feeds, an extra feed just for
[02:08:02.663 --> 02:08:07.646]  What I'm setting up, it'll be 24 hours a day, Alex Jones, for the radio stations out there.
[02:08:07.686 --> 02:08:10.067]  We're only on there 9 hours a day right now on the Genesis feed.
[02:08:11.088 --> 02:08:12.269]  Stations want that.
[02:08:12.889 --> 02:08:15.551]  But there'll be spots in there where there'll be other shows.
[02:08:18.112 --> 02:08:18.712]  We're innovating.
[02:08:18.732 --> 02:08:20.033]  We're doing a lot of new things here.
[02:08:20.954 --> 02:08:22.474]  And we need your financial support.
[02:08:22.614 --> 02:08:25.896]  And the way I ask you to support us is to buy the books and videos we offer.
[02:08:25.976 --> 02:08:26.596]  I watch films.
[02:08:26.656 --> 02:08:27.357]  I see documentaries.
[02:08:27.417 --> 02:08:27.857]  I read books.
[02:08:27.877 --> 02:08:29.038]  I think they're the best stuff out there.
[02:08:29.738 --> 02:08:32.199]  I add it to the catalog at InfoWars.com online.
[02:08:32.659 --> 02:08:35.341]  And we got this up last week, but I haven't even plugged it yet until today.
[02:08:35.401 --> 02:08:36.682]  Volume 1, Traffic Stops.
[02:08:37.796 --> 02:08:42.082]  Barry Cooper is a hero because he is standing up and declaring the war on drugs is not working.
[02:08:42.142 --> 02:08:43.384]  Tucker Carlson, MSNBC.
[02:08:43.705 --> 02:08:44.466]  Actually, it is working.
[02:08:44.506 --> 02:08:48.011]  It's meant to enslave us, but that's from the position of, you know, the government wants to help us.
[02:08:48.732 --> 02:08:51.156]  And this is a great film we're offering at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:52.958 --> 02:08:59.101]  You can go to Infowars.com and they're on the site, link through to secure online shopping cart.
[02:09:00.002 --> 02:09:01.823]  And we'll put up the Infowars shopping cart up there.
[02:09:01.843 --> 02:09:08.166]  And then you can also get his second film, Volume 2, Never Get Raided, Barry Cooper's Never Get Busted Again.
[02:09:08.406 --> 02:09:15.450]  And this is important information for anybody, even if somebody's not involved with marijuana or whatever, to understand how these systems work.
[02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:19.813]  He's been stinging police, catching them without warrants, catching them busting in houses with hidden cameras.
[02:09:20.433 --> 02:09:23.076]  Really exposing as a former narcotics officer himself.
[02:09:23.437 --> 02:09:29.303]  So again, please go to Infowars.com and that way you don't just support us, you also support Barry Cooper by getting his films.
[02:09:29.323 --> 02:09:34.429]  We have them comboed up with the film that I consulted on, Five Years in the Making.
[02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:38.191]  That is American Drug War by Kevin Booth.
[02:09:38.211 --> 02:09:39.511]  It's got three hours of extras.
[02:09:39.551 --> 02:09:40.351]  It's a two-hour film.
[02:09:40.371 --> 02:09:43.632]  One of the most popular shows ever aired on Showtime.
[02:09:44.112 --> 02:09:50.533]  And we have that in a three-pack combo with a huge discount, or you can buy the films individually at Infowars.com.
[02:09:50.854 --> 02:09:57.535]  Now, we got you in here about 20 minutes late today, Barry, because you guys actually got turned around.
[02:09:58.935 --> 02:10:00.776]  We're going to go into 20 minutes of overdrive today.
[02:10:02.276 --> 02:10:06.258]  So that we have plenty of time to talk, and later we'll get Candy in here as well.
[02:10:07.078 --> 02:10:18.242]  But I think before we go to break, I just want to welcome you back and say that I haven't seen you in a couple weeks, but that we tentatively have talked about you getting a Saturday or Sunday night show here on the InfoWars Radio TV Network.
[02:10:18.682 --> 02:10:24.384]  Looking forward to that, Alex, and I've paid close attention to your work lately.
[02:10:24.424 --> 02:10:30.026]  We were watching a clip last night on that American Drug War video that Kevin Booth put together.
[02:10:30.686 --> 02:10:34.251]  When you faced Barry Caffey, the drug czar.
[02:10:34.271 --> 02:10:36.174]  Yeah, Barry McCaffrey, the drug czar.
[02:10:36.234 --> 02:10:39.138]  And I brought up Reuters with his head... I mispronounced his name on purpose.
[02:10:39.199 --> 02:10:39.940]  No, no, I understand.
[02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:40.581]  Disrespect.
[02:10:41.342 --> 02:10:42.583]  Bob, I mean, tell folks what happened there.
[02:10:44.023 --> 02:11:06.518]  What I saw was him giving a speech and Alex Jones got a chance to ask him a question and he boldly faced the US drug czar with the question of how is it we've got all the evidence that top government officials are involved in drug trafficking and he was surprised at the question and bobbled around it really didn't answer it and later laughed at you.
[02:11:06.638 --> 02:11:09.621]  Well then his psych warfare answer was, I love the babies.
[02:11:10.301 --> 02:11:11.843]  Aren't you for the little babies?
[02:11:13.364 --> 02:11:20.010]  They sent him to schools called Delphi Technique of how to hit primitive code words to get people from conscious brain to subconscious.
[02:11:20.391 --> 02:11:26.977]  And I read to him on a Reuters, the head of all South American, Central American narcotics operations of South Com.
[02:11:27.677 --> 02:11:29.798]  Was caught shipping in masses of heroin and cocaine.
[02:11:29.858 --> 02:11:30.658]  Caught, pled guilty!
[02:11:30.998 --> 02:11:33.779]  They said, oh, it was just an accident, just a, just a, just a so and such.
[02:11:34.339 --> 02:11:35.740]  Uh, so that's what shook him up, yeah.
[02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:38.181]  Yeah, well, I thought it was good work.
[02:11:38.401 --> 02:11:39.281]  Well, thank you for bringing that up.
[02:11:39.301 --> 02:11:40.022]  We're gonna go to break.
[02:11:40.042 --> 02:11:44.143]  We're gonna come right back and just let you have the floor and get into whatever subject you want.
[02:11:44.423 --> 02:11:46.224]  I'm also hearing rumors of you running for office.
[02:11:47.763 --> 02:11:48.865]  Uh, here in Texas.
[02:11:48.905 --> 02:11:50.467]  So, that is coming up, folks.
[02:11:50.567 --> 02:11:50.988]  It is.
[02:11:51.028 --> 02:11:52.690]  Barry Cooper's never get busted again.
[02:11:53.211 --> 02:11:55.054]  Alternative Media, get these videos.
[02:11:55.074 --> 02:11:56.436]  This is something special.

[02:12:01.897 --> 02:12:10.283]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[02:12:27.076 --> 02:12:29.338]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:14:01.922 --> 02:14:07.344]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[02:14:07.604 --> 02:14:08.865]  And we knew what to do.
[02:14:09.667 --> 02:14:10.688]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:14:10.909 --> 02:14:17.337]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:14:17.958 --> 02:14:26.490]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:14:26.857 --> 02:14:33.661]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:14:33.962 --> 02:14:37.003]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:14:37.123 --> 02:14:42.327]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[02:14:42.907 --> 02:14:45.529]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:14:45.969 --> 02:14:51.793]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:14:55.779 --> 02:14:59.831]  The government sponsored terror they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law
[02:15:01.215 --> 02:15:05.819]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[02:15:06.139 --> 02:15:13.324]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[02:15:13.585 --> 02:15:14.966]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[02:15:15.186 --> 02:15:19.089]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[02:15:19.349 --> 02:15:22.932]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[02:15:23.192 --> 02:15:27.275]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[02:15:27.655 --> 02:15:31.118]  Phase One is a One World Currency, which we are currently being prepared to
[02:15:31.158 --> 02:15:31.498]  I think so.
[02:16:08.513 --> 02:16:12.695]  When they play Hail to the Chief, they point the cannon at you.
[02:16:15.316 --> 02:16:17.677]  Think about that.
[02:16:17.878 --> 02:16:20.799]  They aim the cannons at the crowd.
[02:16:21.719 --> 02:16:25.001]  In the 1950s, they brought in the symbol of fascism into the U.S.
[02:16:25.061 --> 02:16:25.581]  Senate.
[02:16:25.821 --> 02:16:27.602]  The bundle of sticks with the hat that's on the top.
[02:16:28.543 --> 02:16:32.565]  The symbol of Benito Mussolini, of Adolf Hitler, of Julius Caesar.
[02:16:36.075 --> 02:16:39.319]  They arrogantly are setting up a world government, a tyranny in front of you.
[02:16:41.863 --> 02:16:43.645]  And they have the nerve to say it doesn't exist.
[02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:48.391]  When you say you don't want to be part of it.
[02:16:48.992 --> 02:16:51.375]  Okay, this is a short segment Barry, but we're coming back in a long one.
[02:16:52.458 --> 02:16:54.359]  Before you got here today, I was thinking, man, what are we going to talk about?
[02:16:54.379 --> 02:16:57.040]  There is so much that you've done, so much that's gone on.
[02:16:57.380 --> 02:17:04.502]  Recap a little bit about yourself, the things you've witnessed, and some of the things you're doing, some of the new stings you're working on, and your overall mission.
[02:17:05.703 --> 02:17:10.805]  Well, to repeat, our overall mission is to get prisoners, the non-violent drug prisoners out.
[02:17:10.845 --> 02:17:12.085]  We really have a heart for them.
[02:17:12.665 --> 02:17:15.526]  And we've learned activism can get us there.
[02:17:16.206 --> 02:17:20.188]  I was one of our nation's top drug enforcement officers for eight years.
[02:17:20.808 --> 02:17:30.112]  And I quit being a drug cop and over the last two years I've produced two films, Traffic Stops Volume 1 and Never Get Rated Volume 2.
[02:17:30.852 --> 02:17:42.577]  And they are instructional films that teach how to counter DEA's or task force's measures against citizens to place them in jail for marijuana.
[02:17:43.217 --> 02:17:46.079]  Coming off of that success, my wife and I recently
[02:17:47.399 --> 02:18:06.668]  uh... set a trap for crooked cops out in Odessa and they fell into that trap and we've got them on camera in an illegal raid uh... we just learned the Texas Rangers are coming in to investigate the police corruption which is what we called for so we're making some progress there we just got back from Hollywood we can talk about that and uh...
[02:18:07.828 --> 02:18:08.929]  I'm running for office.
[02:18:09.569 --> 02:18:12.070]  We want to announce that as well.
[02:18:12.530 --> 02:18:15.392]  So there's a lot going on.
[02:18:15.872 --> 02:18:17.373]  Let's get into those subjects next.
[02:18:17.453 --> 02:18:19.634]  First off, Texas Rangers.
[02:18:19.674 --> 02:18:22.595]  I'm not saying they're perfect, but we've had some former Texas Rangers.
[02:18:22.675 --> 02:18:30.019]  The guy was an Austin police officer when he went up the tower and shot the bad guy back in the sixties, Whitman, who was shooting everybody.
[02:18:30.679 --> 02:18:33.661]  And I did find it was the Texas Rangers, remember two years ago it turned out,
[02:18:34.321 --> 02:18:38.605]  The state police and the Texas Rangers had found out about the Texas Youth Commission raping all these kids.
[02:18:38.665 --> 02:18:40.607]  We were talking about that on the way up here.
[02:18:41.147 --> 02:18:43.689]  And it was the Texas Rangers trying to stop it, and we're told, stop.
[02:18:44.250 --> 02:18:51.056]  And the head of the DPS just got removed, and I have it from back channels directly, he was removed because he was going after the state officials involved with these kids.
[02:18:51.900 --> 02:18:54.363]  And so, I guess the Texas Rangers seem to be pretty good.
[02:18:54.684 --> 02:19:04.817]  Well, we talked about, well there's corruption in all of law enforcement, but from what I've seen so far, the Texas Rangers do turn in an objective report.
[02:19:06.172 --> 02:19:09.696]  They're good at investigating and they try to keep emotions out of it.
[02:19:10.076 --> 02:19:11.618]  And hopefully that's what we get in this case.
[02:19:11.658 --> 02:19:14.641]  But they're now going after the police that you stung.
[02:19:14.862 --> 02:19:15.462]  Right, right.
[02:19:15.682 --> 02:19:21.629]  But what's interesting is you mentioned those kids getting raped in the prison down there in Texas.
[02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:22.911]  Most of them are marijuana.
[02:19:23.211 --> 02:19:23.992]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:19:24.372 --> 02:19:28.575]  And the Texas Rangers, I think, reported 40-some-odd cases of sexual abuse.
[02:19:28.595 --> 02:19:29.315]  Do you remember the numbers?
[02:19:29.375 --> 02:19:31.276]  And then it turned out it was all over thousands.
[02:19:31.316 --> 02:19:33.298]  Yeah, and not one person was arrested.
[02:19:33.358 --> 02:19:38.041]  Well, I want to make it... I'm running for Attorney General of the state of Texas.
[02:19:38.781 --> 02:19:41.663]  You do not have to be an attorney to run for Attorney General.
[02:19:42.044 --> 02:19:47.847]  And I really am good in court and being an attorney anyway, but that's going to be one of my first cases.
[02:19:47.908 --> 02:19:51.350]  I want to reopen that can of worms on our youth in Texas.
[02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:55.012]  Well, I know, and that's wrong.
[02:19:55.232 --> 02:19:59.914]  If we had a strong Attorney General in there, he would go in and prosecute those people.
[02:19:59.955 --> 02:20:06.558]  If you can't take care of the youth of our country, even the ones that are in jail, then you have nothing to live for.
[02:20:07.478 --> 02:20:15.322]  Our prisoners are forgotten, the kids that are in prison right now are forgotten, and we need to wake up and go back and get our children.
[02:20:15.603 --> 02:20:18.164]  It's craziness what they're doing to our people in prison.
[02:20:18.524 --> 02:20:18.724]  Yeah.
[02:20:19.384 --> 02:20:30.089]  Well, the one time I was in jail as a juvenile, I got in a fight, beat the guy up real bad, even though once I went to court, it was no other's witnesses, Alex was attacked first, but since the guy went to the hospital, I went to jail when the cops got there.
[02:20:30.849 --> 02:20:46.436]  And they took me to Terrell, because I was in Rockwall, but they took me to the juvenile jail in Terrell, I'm up on top of the courthouse, and it was a Friday, so they put me, I didn't go to court in Rockwall until, I don't want to get into these stories, but the point is, I told it before, until Monday.
[02:20:47.236 --> 02:20:54.382]  And by Sunday morning, I mean, I was just sitting in there, you know, doing nothing, getting out one hour a day, watching TV, and I said, hey, I notice other people are taking showers.
[02:20:54.703 --> 02:20:55.463]  Can I take a shower?
[02:20:55.723 --> 02:21:02.429]  This big, fat pedophile, who was one of the jail guards there in Terrell, and I was, you know, pretty handsome, I guess, when I was like, you know, 14 years old or whatever.
[02:21:02.449 --> 02:21:03.550]  Well, I think you're still handsome.
[02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:05.191]  No, I'm big fat ass now.
[02:21:05.452 --> 02:21:11.757]  But anyways, the point is, he takes me into the shower, it's like a one-room shower, and he says, oh, you look pretty good, let's have something.
[02:21:11.777 --> 02:21:12.257]  And I said, listen,
[02:21:12.918 --> 02:21:13.078]  I think?
[02:21:28.063 --> 02:21:28.583]  We're on the march.
[02:21:28.603 --> 02:21:29.484]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:21:55.995 --> 02:21:58.661]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:02.188 --> 02:22:05.571]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:22:05.711 --> 02:22:10.935]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:22:11.115 --> 02:22:15.899]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.

[02:23:01.609 --> 02:23:07.995]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:23:08.356 --> 02:23:10.018]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:23:10.993 --> 02:23:12.014]  But who is the enemy?
[02:23:12.534 --> 02:23:13.034]  Bin Laden.
[02:23:13.334 --> 02:23:14.335]  This is his M.O.
[02:23:14.355 --> 02:23:15.635]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:23:15.695 --> 02:23:17.356]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:23:17.696 --> 02:23:24.440]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:25.280]  Some U.S.
[02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:31.003]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:23:31.683 --> 02:23:35.184]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:23:35.204 --> 02:23:37.965]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:24:01.599 --> 02:24:04.861]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:24:05.042 --> 02:24:09.124]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:24:09.305 --> 02:24:20.733]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:24:20.953 --> 02:24:26.797]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:24:27.077 --> 02:24:27.357]  I'm good.
[02:24:50.191 --> 02:24:53.914]  I wish a buck was still silver, it was black
[02:25:18.114 --> 02:25:40.410]  The country was strong Back before Elvis And before the Vietnam War came along Before the Beatles and yesterday
[02:25:41.653 --> 02:25:46.736]  Before the Beatles and yesterday, there was marijuana everywhere.
[02:25:46.756 --> 02:25:54.842]  There was cocaine, heroin, and you had about a little less than a third of people using it than use it today, statistically.
[02:25:54.862 --> 02:25:59.385]  Because people looked down on the old lady down the street that was a lodnum addict.
[02:25:59.665 --> 02:26:02.487]  They looked down on the guy that was stoned out of his gourd every day.
[02:26:04.366 --> 02:26:07.831]  But then they demonize it with reefer madness saying it makes you commit murders.
[02:26:07.871 --> 02:26:11.536]  Now they're running PSAs that say that, when all the science shows us the opposite.
[02:26:12.117 --> 02:26:13.839]  Makes you go get the munchies and eat nachos.
[02:26:17.524 --> 02:26:21.129]  And so that's how they destroyed America, is with this drug war.
[02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:28.622]  The outside banking cartels that launder the money made the drugs illegal so they could jack up the price and then corrupt the police.
[02:26:29.443 --> 02:26:33.244]  Getting back to the Texas Youth Commission, then all the different TV shows.
[02:26:33.264 --> 02:26:36.366]  There's a feeding frenzy right now with all these big TV shows you're about to start.
[02:26:37.662 --> 02:26:42.606]  In my experience, just watching this, that's when you do get one of the big shows, is when there's three or four deals going.
[02:26:43.466 --> 02:26:44.487]  So that's really exciting.
[02:26:44.507 --> 02:26:48.610]  We'll talk about your run for Attorney General and a lot more, so please continue.
[02:26:49.410 --> 02:26:58.517]  I'm just excited at all the opportunities that we have, and we're putting together a great team to, you know, really help America.
[02:26:58.577 --> 02:27:00.999]  And it doesn't take a politician to always help America.
[02:27:01.639 --> 02:27:08.884]  In fact, right now is the best time for citizens to run because it's kind of the person who doesn't look like a politician that's getting popular and getting elected.
[02:27:08.944 --> 02:27:09.665]  Exactly!
[02:27:09.825 --> 02:27:11.186]  Everybody hates both parties.
[02:27:11.206 --> 02:27:14.828]  That's why they want Obama to suck everybody back into trusting politicians.
[02:27:14.868 --> 02:27:15.909]  But go ahead.
[02:27:15.949 --> 02:27:17.650]  I want to clarify something.
[02:27:17.690 --> 02:27:18.451]  Continue, go ahead.
[02:27:19.292 --> 02:27:21.273]  I wanted to change topic real quick.
[02:27:21.473 --> 02:27:30.619]  When you talk about the pot giving you the munchies, there's actually strains of marijuana like there are different kinds of wines and whiskeys and alcohol
[02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:33.061]  They have it tailor-made now.
[02:27:33.121 --> 02:27:38.484]  For instance, when I was in LA a couple days ago, my manager took me to a pharmacy.
[02:27:38.884 --> 02:27:46.209]  Beautiful place, run very professionally, and he showed his medical marijuana card, and they have different brands in there.
[02:27:46.669 --> 02:27:50.271]  Some pot does not make you hungry and sleepy.
[02:27:50.311 --> 02:27:58.336]  There's some pot that actually gives the person kind of an up buzz that's better for activities such as art and that type of thing.
[02:27:58.356 --> 02:28:05.258]  No, I understand that it's incredibly complex and the government, decades ago, developed all these specific, I mean, just amazing varieties.
[02:28:06.139 --> 02:28:06.919]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:28:06.979 --> 02:28:11.501]  So, it's not just a plant to smoke and catch a buzz and escape from reality.
[02:28:11.521 --> 02:28:19.603]  But for somebody that's had chemotherapy, I mean, I've got friends who are dying of cancer and they give them THC pills of the variety that make them hungry just so they can eat.
[02:28:19.983 --> 02:28:20.784]  Yeah, oh, of course.
[02:28:20.864 --> 02:28:21.924]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:28:21.944 --> 02:28:26.586]  And then I heard you talking last night on that drug war film that
[02:28:27.586 --> 02:28:38.993]  You know, a lot of America is droned out, walking through life without emotion because of Xanax and the uptake inhibitors and those type of things.
[02:28:39.033 --> 02:28:51.000]  And I would just encourage those Americans that are on the Prozac and the antidepressants, try to switch over to the pot because you can maintain emotions and still be... And again, I said this last time, that's what George Washington did.
[02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:52.223]  Well sure, sure.
[02:28:52.584 --> 02:28:57.557]  It helps a lot of people that are very intense in life calm things down a bit too.
[02:28:58.878 --> 02:28:59.478]  To think better.
[02:28:59.498 --> 02:29:00.659]  So I wanted to throw that in.
[02:29:00.679 --> 02:29:09.441]  Well, have you seen these public service announcements where they, and then little blurbs in TV shows, where a murderer who kills his family then goes, oh, the weed made me do it.
[02:29:09.482 --> 02:29:12.502]  They're actually coming back with reefer madness type stuff.
[02:29:12.663 --> 02:29:15.463]  And see, even cocaine doesn't make people commit a crime.
[02:29:15.904 --> 02:29:18.564]  Methamphetamine doesn't make people commit a crime.
[02:29:18.965 --> 02:29:22.666]  You know, we were taught that drugs are good or evil, you know.
[02:29:22.766 --> 02:29:25.006]  Well, drugs can't be good or evil.
[02:29:25.247 --> 02:29:26.147]  They don't have a soul.
[02:29:26.827 --> 02:29:28.167]  They're just a substance.
[02:29:28.247 --> 02:29:29.608]  It's what people do with those.
[02:29:29.988 --> 02:29:40.531]  There's no scientific evidence at all that says if I snort or any person snorts a line of methamphetamine, they're going to become possessed all of a sudden and run over and rob a store.
[02:29:41.371 --> 02:29:42.951]  Drugs do not cause the crimes.
[02:29:43.031 --> 02:29:44.772]  Prohibition causes the crime.
[02:29:45.092 --> 02:29:48.313]  And when you have a selfish person
[02:29:49.628 --> 02:29:52.652]  Taking drugs, then you have a selfish person on drugs.
[02:29:53.013 --> 02:29:58.400]  If you have a barfighter, and then you put that barfighter on drugs, you have a barfighter on drugs.
[02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:00.502]  But it's not the drugs that made him barfight.
[02:30:00.823 --> 02:30:02.805]  It's not the drugs that made the person steal.
[02:30:03.326 --> 02:30:06.370]  It's character issues within the person's selfishness.
[02:30:08.032 --> 02:30:22.288]  Particularly with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors though that aren't natural and that are a byproduct of petrochemical production, they actually eat holes in your brain, they're actually very toxic, and as you said, then making drugs illegal, the basic precursor agents they use are toxic, and then so it's...
[02:30:23.029 --> 02:30:23.609]  Yeah, yeah, and again...
[02:30:42.992 --> 02:30:46.534]  Back to my argument, it's not the drugs causing these crimes.
[02:30:46.635 --> 02:30:53.059]  No different than when I was a cop and I would go in and arrest a guy for beating his wife because he was drunk.
[02:30:53.599 --> 02:30:57.902]  I took him to jail for that assault, but not the liquor bottle next to him.
[02:30:58.503 --> 02:31:01.345]  Where if a person's doing cocaine and they get into a fight,
[02:31:02.085 --> 02:31:07.310]  They go to jail for the fight and the cocaine, because they say the cocaine causes the fight.
[02:31:07.350 --> 02:31:14.476]  Part of the lies that we've been told as kids, and it's the same lies my parents and my grandparents still believe.
[02:31:14.496 --> 02:31:15.196]  Well, I have to say this.
[02:31:15.316 --> 02:31:16.477]  I've done cocaine twice.
[02:31:17.538 --> 02:31:29.268]  When I was like 15, 16, I'd be at a party or something and somebody would say, you know, there's some cocaine in this joint or in this cigarette, and you smoke some of it, and it would just make me feel like
[02:31:30.416 --> 02:31:31.799]  A dirty coffee high.
[02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:36.246]  And then, frankly, many times where I've forgotten and drunk five, six cups of strong coffee.
[02:31:36.767 --> 02:31:42.096]  I mean, I'm ten times more buzzed and jacked up than the two times I did cocaine.
[02:31:42.628 --> 02:31:43.568]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:31:43.968 --> 02:31:45.149]  And again... So what's the deal?
[02:31:45.289 --> 02:31:50.411]  Why do people want to use cocaine when, in my experience, coffee... The sex and the partying.
[02:31:50.511 --> 02:31:57.073]  Cocaine triggers something, and I don't know the science behind it, but it triggers this sexual thing.
[02:31:57.133 --> 02:32:00.674]  And sex is better, the partying, you can party longer.
[02:32:00.694 --> 02:32:01.354]  You know, back in the
[02:32:01.554 --> 02:32:05.998]  In the 80s, it was an extremely popular drug among the elite and the wealthy.
[02:32:06.038 --> 02:32:10.101]  We all know those stories, but that's why cocaine is so attractive.
[02:32:10.441 --> 02:32:18.587]  You really have to have a lot of issues to become a cocaine addict, a true cocaine addict.
[02:32:18.968 --> 02:32:24.272]  Having the craving to snort a line of coke at a party is not the same as addiction.
[02:32:24.292 --> 02:32:27.134]  It's hard to get addicted to cocaine, folks.
[02:32:29.175 --> 02:32:30.657]  The neurons in the brain
[02:32:31.437 --> 02:32:31.597]  Yeah.
[02:32:41.443 --> 02:32:47.307]  Again, we talk about drugs and this isn't just a drug, this is really a drug issue, this is a freedom issue.
[02:32:47.567 --> 02:33:04.039]  Well it is, I mean, what I'm saying is 70 years ago you could walk into any five and dime and they would have a, I mean even small stores would have a small pharmacy area at the back and there was cocaine, heroin, you know just everything there on the shelf and there were addicts
[02:33:04.739 --> 02:33:12.485]  And, you know, I've been out in the countryside at some old burned-down farm, you know, from the 30s or something, and there's those laudanum bottles just in piles out in the woods everywhere.
[02:33:12.645 --> 02:33:13.266]  Opium bottles.
[02:33:14.045 --> 02:33:16.506]  But, I mean, that person was addicted and had a problem.
[02:33:16.746 --> 02:33:18.827]  They didn't, you know, need to go to prison.
[02:33:18.847 --> 02:33:20.687]  I mean, they bought that at Eckerd's.
[02:33:20.747 --> 02:33:22.088]  Well, Americans are smart.
[02:33:22.108 --> 02:33:24.649]  Through education, we cut cigarette smoking by 50%.
[02:33:25.449 --> 02:33:36.753]  The government, those men that sit in Washington, D.C., believe they have to outlaw something to protect Americans, when the truth is, we should be able to decide our own health.
[02:33:37.802 --> 02:33:46.928]  And as long as those drugs or whatever we use aren't causing harm to somebody else, we should have that freedom to use that particular substance.
[02:33:47.348 --> 02:33:56.394]  And I know we're repeating the same arguments, but here's what we have to really concentrate on, and that's the life of a prisoner.
[02:33:56.774 --> 02:34:02.278]  Listen, there are people sitting through this, at the time it took to finish this interview,
[02:34:03.098 --> 02:34:09.139]  Every 38 seconds through this interview, somebody got handcuffed and put in the back of a patrol car.
[02:34:09.599 --> 02:34:11.580]  And they're headed to a cage right now.
[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:13.640]  And those places stink.
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:15.040]  They're scary.
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:16.220]  They're horrible.
[02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:17.981]  They're full of pedophiles.
[02:34:18.981 --> 02:34:21.901]  You wouldn't believe what some of the guards look like.
[02:34:22.362 --> 02:34:25.002]  You know, we're living in a country... I call them maggot demons.
[02:34:25.042 --> 02:34:29.123]  Yeah, they believe that they're there to punish people instead of incarcerate people.
[02:34:29.143 --> 02:34:30.463]  Well, they get off on the sadist.
[02:34:30.723 --> 02:34:31.504]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:34:31.644 --> 02:34:32.184]  They're sadists.
[02:34:32.284 --> 02:34:32.504]  Right.
[02:34:32.584 --> 02:34:38.408]  I mean, I've been in juvenile one time for two days and somebody tried to rape me and it was a guard.
[02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:41.970]  One visit, folks, one visit.
[02:34:42.010 --> 02:34:43.931]  Somebody's getting raped right now in jail.
[02:34:43.951 --> 02:34:45.032]  Oh, they're getting raped everywhere.
[02:34:45.072 --> 02:34:50.055]  Yeah, that got put in there over a drug, a non-violent drug crime.
[02:34:50.155 --> 02:34:58.601]  And then the jail guards and the cops, they all defend their corruption just like CPS when they kill kids or, you know, get them drowned or, you know, whatever or use them for sex.
[02:34:59.221 --> 02:35:03.984]  Because the system wants to protect itself all its crime, so the smart criminals are filling the government.
[02:35:04.244 --> 02:35:13.689]  That's right, and the judges and the prosecutors that are supposed to be a checks and balance on these police officers are actually enablers.
[02:35:14.269 --> 02:35:18.492]  They're enabling the police to continue their power structure.
[02:35:19.292 --> 02:35:26.816]  Because a judge can wheel, he's got, he can't be, I mean I sue judges, but the Attorney General always wiggles them out of it.
[02:35:26.996 --> 02:35:39.423]  And if a probation officer doesn't nail young people, or non-violent folks, and doesn't find reasons to keep them under the thumb, or send them back to jail, they get kicked out themselves.
[02:35:39.463 --> 02:35:40.424]  That's right, that's right.
[02:35:40.564 --> 02:35:41.805]  And I want to make this point.
[02:35:43.021 --> 02:35:49.166]  We, uh, the adults that you hear in our country talk about, our kids are going to pot.
[02:35:49.206 --> 02:35:50.427]  What's wrong with our kids?
[02:35:50.467 --> 02:35:52.408]  They don't show respect anymore.
[02:35:53.169 --> 02:36:00.575]  There is a principle that says when there's a problem in a company, a government, a family, a school, anywhere, it's always leadership.
[02:36:02.016 --> 02:36:03.297]  Instead of leadership,
[02:36:04.275 --> 02:36:04.655]  We're good
[02:36:26.927 --> 02:36:27.467]  Exactly.
[02:36:27.547 --> 02:36:29.148]  It is the adults and the grandparents.
[02:36:29.268 --> 02:36:31.188]  It is their fault America's gone to hell.
[02:36:31.208 --> 02:36:32.049]  And let me expand on that.
[02:36:32.509 --> 02:36:49.034]  When you take, on average, several million children a year and incarcerate them in the CPS or in the juvenile justice system, every study, every statistic going back to, you know, to the panoptagon in France 300 years ago and the modern prison system off of that,
[02:36:49.694 --> 02:37:13.917]  They know, the establishment knows, that it actually is a university of crime, a university of gangs, and that's why our children act like gang members, because in all the groups of our children are people that have been institutionalized, and so it's literally polluting all of society, and you're right, it rolls from the warden to the corrupt jail guards, who are selling drugs on the side to the inmates, right down.
[02:37:14.838 --> 02:37:29.034]  They had a study, they've been doing it for decades, for 2008 and it just came out on the 1st of January, the LA Times reported on it, that they watch over the decades the number of children in surveys, teenagers, that say they lie, they cheat on tests, they steal.
[02:37:29.935 --> 02:37:32.497]  And decades ago it was like 15-20 percent, and it went up 30, 40, 50.
[02:37:33.217 --> 02:37:39.281]  It's now over 50-plus percent admit they steal, they lie, they cheat, and they were asked, why do you do that?
[02:37:39.301 --> 02:37:46.886]  And they said, everybody knows Crooks run the government, Crooks run society, this is a criminal society, our teachers want us to cheat so that they get the bonuses.
[02:37:47.206 --> 02:37:56.312]  They basically hand out, and I was too dumb in school to know why some of the teachers, they didn't know all of this, would kind of hand out and leave around the answers the week before the test that was coming up.
[02:37:56.812 --> 02:37:57.793]  I mean, I remember that.
[02:37:58.293 --> 02:38:00.996]  And what I'm saying is we are a corrupt... Look at Mexico.
[02:38:01.236 --> 02:38:08.703]  It's totally collapsing right now where basic services can't even operate now because they've become a completely corrupt society.
[02:38:08.723 --> 02:38:09.484]  So you're absolutely right.
[02:38:09.544 --> 02:38:10.465]  It is the leadership.
[02:38:10.685 --> 02:38:11.086]  That's right.
[02:38:11.106 --> 02:38:12.287]  A fish rots from the head.
[02:38:12.647 --> 02:38:20.755]  And our parents and our grandparents were too busy in the church teaching the kids, don't drink, don't cuss, don't smoke, don't have sex.
[02:38:21.175 --> 02:38:24.199]  You know, Willie Nelson, Willie Nelson says that's what made him become a party animal.
[02:38:24.219 --> 02:38:24.780]  Yeah, they need him.
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:28.064]  Because they told him, don't do all this, as soon as he got out of the house, he said, party time!
[02:38:28.124 --> 02:38:28.625]  Party!
[02:38:28.805 --> 02:38:29.246]  Party!
[02:38:29.426 --> 02:38:30.808]  It's legalism, it's laws.
[02:38:31.649 --> 02:38:34.112]  Candy and I... See, my parents didn't do that, so I never got into drugs.
[02:38:34.152 --> 02:38:37.277]  Yeah, Candy and I teach our kids, and it's worked.
[02:38:37.617 --> 02:38:42.063]  We've got a 16-year-old daughter we just dropped off at Austin Community College.
[02:38:42.564 --> 02:38:53.319]  We spend our time teaching our kids character qualities like loyalty, kindness, love, consideration, honor, respect.
[02:38:54.821 --> 02:39:15.742]  When they do go out, and if they do start drinking, doing drugs, having sex, because you know they're going to experiment with those, we have a good quality human being out there that's loving and kind and caring and loyal and honest, so when they do do that line of coke at a party, that selfishness that's been taught them all their life doesn't turn into them going and trying to steal something.
[02:39:17.839 --> 02:39:28.603]  It works to bring back teaching, instead of calling it morals, call it, because morals can be anything, call it character qualities and stop teaching your kids.
[02:39:28.903 --> 02:39:47.171]  You know, if you have your kid in a church right now, going through a six week program of celibacy, and for six weeks they're telling your kid, don't have sex, don't have sex, don't have sex, and if you sign on this contract, we're going to give you a ring, and you're going to walk across the stage and all the parents are going to clap, I call bull
[02:39:47.631 --> 02:39:48.591]  Well, let me stop you there.
[02:39:48.611 --> 02:39:50.232]  They actually have done a bunch of studies on that.
[02:39:50.492 --> 02:39:55.574]  And whereas it's not bad for parents to teach their daughters and sons, look, this is a serious thing.
[02:39:55.614 --> 02:39:56.555]  It produces babies.
[02:39:56.635 --> 02:39:58.556]  You don't want to get into abortions and kill your baby.
[02:40:00.316 --> 02:40:01.497]  You don't want to be destructive.
[02:40:01.517 --> 02:40:02.517]  You can get diseases.
[02:40:02.877 --> 02:40:05.058]  This is a loving thing and a special thing.
[02:40:05.358 --> 02:40:07.839]  Statistically, they don't go running around and have a bunch of sex.
[02:40:07.919 --> 02:40:08.540]  But you're right.
[02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:13.842]  They've done studies at these high schools and churches where they have them wear the rings, make a big deal out of it.
[02:40:14.282 --> 02:40:27.774]  All they're now thinking about is sex, and they found that the children that have done the celibacy classes are many times more likely to have sex, and the most destructive types of sex, because you're right, and that goes back to the Middle Ages with the chastity belts.
[02:40:28.374 --> 02:40:40.305]  Those people couldn't wait to have sex with whoever they could, because they were literally wearing a locked belt around their waist, and it made it all, and that's really about the perverts at the church wanting to look at girls going across the stage talking about how they're celibate.
[02:40:41.445 --> 02:40:42.306]  You're absolutely right.
[02:40:42.846 --> 02:40:45.987]  They've done studies where they put up billboards saying don't smoke, people smoke more.
[02:40:46.047 --> 02:40:49.889]  They say, oh this is taboo, marijuana is taboo, people want to go out and smoke it.
[02:40:50.469 --> 02:40:51.029]  Anyways, you're right.
[02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:55.411]  Yeah, so I think we just need to get back to the ground roots of parenting.
[02:40:56.112 --> 02:41:01.794]  And while my parents worked like slaves to pay taxes, they weren't good parents.
[02:41:01.934 --> 02:41:05.956]  And most of the people I've met had dysfunctional homes.
[02:41:06.636 --> 02:41:10.980]  And we keep talking about bringing the family back, bringing the family back.
[02:41:11.340 --> 02:41:17.726]  Well we're in error and we're off track when we concentrate on teaching our kids laws and legalisms.
[02:41:17.766 --> 02:41:20.669]  Don't drink, don't cuss, don't smoke, don't have sex, don't have drugs.
[02:41:21.169 --> 02:41:22.430]  None of that stuff is working.
[02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:23.732]  That celibacy class?
[02:41:24.232 --> 02:41:26.654]  That, Alex, that you were talking about getting the ring?
[02:41:27.074 --> 02:41:31.078]  Had they spent six weeks teaching what jealousy looks like?
[02:41:31.198 --> 02:41:36.642]  Okay, you girls over here, you're acting jealous when you do this, because jealousy is crueler than the grave.
[02:41:37.022 --> 02:41:38.924]  And man, it is rampant in our nation.
[02:41:39.264 --> 02:41:40.385]  I run into that everywhere.
[02:41:40.405 --> 02:41:43.348]  That's why you don't put the children in the public schools if you can't, because it's so mean.
[02:41:43.448 --> 02:41:44.408]  It's horrible, I know.
[02:41:44.468 --> 02:41:47.030]  So we could teach our kids, have a class on jealousy.
[02:41:48.231 --> 02:41:57.753]  And teach them, look, if you have a mate or somebody you're attracted to, and they're showing this red flag of jealousy, and they won't quit, that's a red flag.
[02:41:57.793 --> 02:42:07.255]  Don't be involved with that partner, because I was married to a lady that was very jealous for 10 years, but nobody had taught me these things, because I was too busy being taught, don't drink, don't cuss, don't phone.
[02:42:07.275 --> 02:42:11.296]  I'm teaching my children, when kids are mean to you or put you down, just don't be their friends.
[02:42:11.516 --> 02:42:12.656]  Of course, yeah, move on.
[02:42:12.897 --> 02:42:14.317]  Because that's somebody that wants to be mean.
[02:42:14.357 --> 02:42:18.039]  You want to find that one... I mean, you're blessed if you can find one or two really real friends.
[02:42:18.059 --> 02:42:18.499]  That's right.
[02:42:19.239 --> 02:42:19.639]  That's right.
[02:42:19.659 --> 02:42:23.761]  Well, you know, society is getting more and more jealous, backstabbing, crazy.
[02:42:24.201 --> 02:42:25.842]  I mean, it's getting... Have you noticed how bad it's getting?
[02:42:26.062 --> 02:42:40.628]  Oh, listen, my brother-in-law, who I went to the police academy with, we married sisters and we were best friends, and through the divorce, he flipped and wasn't my friend anymore, and him and I got into a fist fight over it, and the police had to break it up.
[02:42:41.448 --> 02:42:42.329]  It's so mean.
[02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:49.217]  My ex-wife, and I've got two daughters by her, Candy and I, the stepmother, want to get along.
[02:42:49.637 --> 02:42:53.381]  In fact, Candy's ex-husband, we barbecue with, help raise the kid together.
[02:42:53.661 --> 02:42:55.183]  We know how to get along in mixed families.
[02:42:55.544 --> 02:42:56.184]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:42:56.204 --> 02:42:57.145]  We're about to come right back.
[02:42:57.386 --> 02:42:58.487]  We're going to overdrive as well.
[02:42:58.507 --> 02:43:00.729]  We'll talk about running for office when we get back.
[02:43:01.997 --> 02:43:12.087]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[02:44:13.227 --> 02:44:15.389]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:44:16.009 --> 02:44:18.471]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:44:19.192 --> 02:44:26.518]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:44:29.548 --> 02:44:34.492]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:46:14.468 --> 02:46:19.213]  Wasn't there an astronaut named Barry Cooper?
[02:46:19.253 --> 02:46:19.733]  I don't think so.
[02:46:25.549 --> 02:46:26.390]  I think there was.
[02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:27.771]  I'm going to Google it right here.
[02:46:28.291 --> 02:46:29.212]  Google Barry Cooper.
[02:46:29.232 --> 02:46:30.713]  Let's see other famous Barry Coopers.
[02:46:31.213 --> 02:46:43.362]  Hey folks, we're going to go into 20 minutes of overdrive, which won't be on the AM and FM dial, or the shortwave, but it will be at Infowars.com on the audio streams, and it will be at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:46:44.083 --> 02:46:50.527]  Get Traffic Stops, Never Get Busted Again, Volume 1, Volume 2, Never Get Raided,
[02:46:51.621 --> 02:46:56.744]  And this has got knowledge and information, you know, dealing with the CPS trying to steal your kids, anything.
[02:46:57.344 --> 02:47:01.266]  Because you might just put a washer and dryer shooting heat out of your house, you're going to get SWAT teamed.
[02:47:01.987 --> 02:47:14.613]  I know one old lady who had a bunch of fish tanks because she was a retired professor who studied fish, and they looked at her power bill to see, well, one person lives here and the power bill's way up here, and in Austin they use that as a way to raid her.
[02:47:15.174 --> 02:47:15.914]  Had you ever heard of that?
[02:47:16.254 --> 02:47:16.934]  Yes, of course.
[02:47:17.995 --> 02:47:19.536]  I had until a few years ago when I talked to her.
[02:47:20.096 --> 02:47:22.618]  But anyways, these are available at Infowars.com right now.
[02:47:22.638 --> 02:47:26.221]  We also have them comboed up with a Kevin Booth's American Drug War.
[02:47:26.261 --> 02:47:30.003]  Okay, in the main radio show time we have left a little three or four minutes here.
[02:47:30.864 --> 02:47:32.625]  Tell us about the Attorney General run.
[02:47:33.305 --> 02:47:36.507]  Tell us about where that's going and the TV shows that you're developing.
[02:47:36.688 --> 02:47:47.335]  Okay, Joey Dobbin is a reporter and Megan is his partner and she is on the board of the Libertarian State, whatever that board is.
[02:47:47.995 --> 02:47:49.536]  They're going to help me campaign.
[02:47:49.576 --> 02:47:52.838]  They came to me thinking it would be a good idea to run for Congress again.
[02:47:52.898 --> 02:48:00.483]  And I talked to them about Attorney General and they learned you do not have to be an attorney to be Attorney General.
[02:48:01.063 --> 02:48:07.928]  And we think that position, because we want to use any fame in Hollywood, any money we get, any political positions we get,
[02:48:09.409 --> 02:48:14.813]  And you've got a chance.
[02:48:14.874 --> 02:48:16.455]  I mean, things would be much worse.
[02:48:16.515 --> 02:48:20.959]  Just 30 years ago, prisoners were slaves in chain gangs and that was reformed.
[02:48:21.899 --> 02:48:25.702]  So, I mean, everything the government's doing is unpopular and unconstitutional.
[02:48:26.023 --> 02:48:28.224]  People can't say, oh, it's too hard, we can't fix it.
[02:48:29.465 --> 02:48:31.626]  I mean, even if you don't win, you're going to educate people.
[02:48:31.646 --> 02:48:32.486]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:48:32.646 --> 02:48:39.588]  And if I don't get assassinated, which I don't think I will, and I win Attorney General's spot, get ready, because I am going to make changes.
[02:48:39.728 --> 02:48:41.269]  I don't have political issues.
[02:48:41.709 --> 02:48:43.489]  I make my own money with these films.
[02:48:43.949 --> 02:48:45.150]  I don't need their paychecks.
[02:48:45.270 --> 02:48:51.972]  I don't need to leverage the office of Attorney General, because Attorney General is the lawyer for the state of Texas.
[02:48:52.032 --> 02:48:56.093]  And right now, it seems the Attorney Generals in most of the states
[02:48:56.593 --> 02:49:08.476]  are busy using their team of lawyers and their law practice to handle corporate law problems to funnel money to other politicians.
[02:49:08.637 --> 02:49:09.297]  I don't need that.
[02:49:09.457 --> 02:49:10.177]  I don't want that.
[02:49:10.257 --> 02:49:12.498]  As Attorney General, I'm going to walk into those prisons.
[02:49:12.858 --> 02:49:15.458]  I'll have the power to walk into those prisons.
[02:49:15.519 --> 02:49:18.499]  I will have the power to examine lawsuits.
[02:49:18.579 --> 02:49:19.220]  When a citizen sues a cop,
[02:49:25.100 --> 02:49:27.002]  The Attorney General takes a look at it.
[02:49:28.003 --> 02:49:30.605]  I will be able to go, no, this is a valid lawsuit.
[02:49:30.685 --> 02:49:33.788]  In fact, my team's going to go apologize to that citizen.
[02:49:34.629 --> 02:49:35.810]  Settle out of court with a check.
[02:49:35.830 --> 02:49:36.811]  Sounds like Bobby Kennedy.
[02:49:37.531 --> 02:49:38.452]  Whatever it takes.
[02:49:38.552 --> 02:49:40.054]  I'm not sure what he did.
[02:49:40.314 --> 02:49:41.135]  That's what I want to do.
[02:49:41.175 --> 02:49:45.358]  I want to get back to those citizens because they are the engine of this country.
[02:49:45.699 --> 02:49:47.721]  We're the ones that are supposed to be running it.
[02:49:48.101 --> 02:49:51.544]  And frankly, I have no respect for the people that are in office.
[02:49:51.544 --> 02:49:52.284]  We're going to have you back.
[02:49:52.304 --> 02:49:53.905]  Plus, she'll be doing a show here in the next few weeks.
[02:49:53.925 --> 02:49:54.926]  You can talk about it there.
[02:49:55.166 --> 02:49:57.467]  People can find out more at NeverGetBusted.com.
[02:49:57.867 --> 02:50:03.310]  In the 45 seconds we've got left before we go to overdrive, we'll have a one-minute break and come back, folks, live.
[02:50:03.790 --> 02:50:04.751]  Tell folks about the TV shows.
[02:50:05.327 --> 02:50:07.388]  Okay, we just got back from Hollywood.
[02:50:07.428 --> 02:50:16.312]  Candy and I were going back in three weeks to meet with four major broadcasters.
[02:50:16.372 --> 02:50:17.353]  I can't tell who it is.
[02:50:17.373 --> 02:50:18.333]  They asked me not to.
[02:50:18.373 --> 02:50:20.114]  But I'll be able to announce that in three weeks.
[02:50:20.474 --> 02:50:22.915]  Looks like we have a pop comedy going.
[02:50:23.176 --> 02:50:25.637]  And then I had talks with Kevin Booth.
[02:50:26.077 --> 02:50:29.559]  He's the filmmaker of the American Drug War film.
[02:50:29.639 --> 02:50:32.660]  I think it's the best anti-drug war film out there right now.
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:34.481]  Him and I are in talks.
[02:50:34.841 --> 02:50:36.182]  Alright, we gotta end this out.
[02:50:36.323 --> 02:50:38.525]  Let's come back and go through it slowly, because it's exciting.
[02:50:38.545 --> 02:50:40.587]  And it just shows what one guy taking action can do.
[02:50:40.607 --> 02:50:41.127]  Stay with us.
[02:50:43.229 --> 02:50:45.071]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:50:53.430 --> 02:50:58.053]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:50:58.173 --> 02:51:00.934]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:51:01.134 --> 02:51:03.996]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:51:04.176 --> 02:51:08.899]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:51:09.119 --> 02:51:10.060]  If you simply prepare.
[02:51:10.261 --> 02:51:13.185]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:51:13.505 --> 02:51:20.395]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[02:51:40.909 --> 02:51:42.730]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:52:19.525 --> 02:52:20.290]  We're good to go.
[02:52:32.296 --> 02:52:37.620]  All right there, they're in there testing out the new studio, having a little fun with us live here on air.
[02:52:38.701 --> 02:52:49.649]  And we are live in maximum overdrive for another 20 minutes with the maker of Never Get Busted, NeverGetBusted.com, Volume 1, Traffic Stops, Volume 2, Never Get Rated.
[02:52:51.314 --> 02:52:52.796]  And this is something everybody needs to have.
[02:52:53.216 --> 02:52:56.440]  Again, available at InfoWars.com or NeverGetBusted.com as well.
[02:52:56.700 --> 02:53:04.509]  We have it combo'd up on InfoWars.com with Kevin Booth's American Drug War that's a full-length film, but it also has something Showtime doesn't have when it airs on there.
[02:53:04.850 --> 02:53:09.135]  Three hours of extras, there's really a whole film or two in and of itself.
[02:53:09.455 --> 02:53:10.817]  Okay, let's continue with...
[02:53:12.173 --> 02:53:21.661]  A case point example of you're a narcotics officer, very successful, you're doing the standard thing, you said what 85% of them do, and this comes out all the time, framing people.
[02:53:22.321 --> 02:53:34.912]  And then you kind of have this epiphany, this is wicked, this is bad, you wake up, you say no, and then now, run through briefly, recapping from a few weeks ago when you were here, the saga and some of the highlights and lowlights of what happened, but then
[02:53:35.772 --> 02:53:45.735]  The moral of the story is, here you are with films being seen by tens of thousands of people, going on shows being heard by millions of people, and you've got four TV deals guaranteed.
[02:53:45.755 --> 02:53:50.697]  In the past I've seen that many deals going, one should at least hit, or one will come in the future.
[02:53:51.457 --> 02:53:53.318]  And the tide is turning.
[02:53:53.358 --> 02:53:58.879]  I mean, polls are over 90% I've seen for drug decriminalization, but the government doesn't care.
[02:53:59.399 --> 02:54:08.842]  Supposedly of, for, by the people, but this tiny group of police and judges and prison owners and the CIA shipping the main narcotics in, they don't want their business to be screwed up.
[02:54:08.902 --> 02:54:13.243]  So you got 10% brainwashed who serve the 1% that are involved in it.
[02:54:14.183 --> 02:54:19.445]  And I've talked to drug dealers before and famous, you know, retired or in prison, Ricky Ross, people like that.
[02:54:19.465 --> 02:54:26.528]  And they'll say, oh yeah, we all knew it was the government and, you know, government operation and that they didn't want drugs legalized because that would kill their business.
[02:54:26.568 --> 02:54:35.232]  So let's talk about, you know, recapping the things you've done, some of the stings you've been on, some of the things you've witnessed, and then, you know, the moral of the story again, that you're having this great effect.
[02:54:35.292 --> 02:54:39.794]  Another example for people out there that work on the dark side who've been rationalizing that,
[02:54:40.154 --> 02:54:46.278]  But who know in their heart and soul and intellect that what they're doing is wrong, you could be doing what Barry Cooper's doing, or what so many others are doing.
[02:54:46.318 --> 02:54:50.180]  You just have to start that journey of a thousand miles with that first step.
[02:54:50.380 --> 02:54:56.984]  Yeah, and I want to mention, here's the big excuse most the cops use when they email or call or whatever.
[02:54:57.024 --> 02:54:58.425]  They say, well, Barry, it's the law.
[02:54:58.885 --> 02:55:04.688]  So right now to keep my job, I have to keep putting these people in jail for these non-violent drug crimes.
[02:55:04.728 --> 02:55:08.911]  And I say, no, you're wrong, because the law says you may arrest
[02:55:09.451 --> 02:55:12.594]  For the marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, not shall arrest.
[02:55:13.074 --> 02:55:13.915]  Not like a warrant.
[02:55:13.955 --> 02:55:18.159]  If I have a warrant for a person's arrest, it says I shall arrest.
[02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:20.001]  Well, the law is very clear.
[02:55:20.061 --> 02:55:23.364]  They may arrest, so they can pour it out and let you go.
[02:55:23.724 --> 02:55:25.005]  And then I bring up this point.
[02:55:25.886 --> 02:55:32.973]  If you're using that argument to take a life and put them in a cage because it's the law, then you're the same person
[02:55:34.989 --> 02:55:45.311]  Just years ago, back in my grandparents' day, that would have beaten and hung a slave that escaped because it was the law that you could do that.
[02:55:46.505 --> 02:55:52.190]  Rosa Parks had to stand up on a bus one day and say enough is enough.
[02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:56.333]  The police officers can do that as well, but let me tell you their motive.
[02:55:56.633 --> 02:55:59.075]  Here's why the police won't turn loose of that grip.
[02:55:59.195 --> 02:56:06.982]  It's because the adrenaline rush of arresting people for drugs and the recognition that they get among their department
[02:56:07.902 --> 02:56:08.683]  is huge.
[02:56:08.763 --> 02:56:09.703]  Being patted on the head.
[02:56:09.723 --> 02:56:12.464]  The narcotics guys are looked to as, woo, the G4.
[02:56:12.725 --> 02:56:16.607]  I mean, even the chiefs and the sheriffs cater to them as the golden boys.
[02:56:17.467 --> 02:56:20.289]  Well, because they bring money into the state that's given back to the department.
[02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.569]  Yes.
[02:56:20.589 --> 02:56:21.529]  With the seizures.
[02:56:21.689 --> 02:56:27.713]  Yes, they don't want to give that position of power and celebrity-ship up.
[02:56:27.773 --> 02:56:32.095]  How do they psychologically screen you to make sure you're the type that'll do the frame-ups and all of this?
[02:56:33.944 --> 02:56:42.491]  Actually, what happens is you work yourself into a narcotics position by whatever means you do, and then when you get in there, the guys start feeling you out.
[02:56:43.352 --> 02:56:44.673]  You know, can he be trusted?
[02:56:44.713 --> 02:56:46.294]  Will he talk to the brass?
[02:56:46.895 --> 02:56:50.958]  And you know, it'll usually start out as civilians that night.
[02:56:50.998 --> 02:56:57.363]  You're in a club, and there's a fight, and you knock one of them out as a cop.
[02:56:58.444 --> 02:57:00.146]  Are all the other cops going to tell on you?
[02:57:00.996 --> 02:57:14.445]  And if the three that you're with don't tell on each other, and you're the rookie, those two cops realize, hey, we can groom this guy to run illegal raids, and then you're kind of in that.
[02:57:14.545 --> 02:57:17.047]  Well, the Nazis called that the cement of blood.
[02:57:17.707 --> 02:57:21.830]  They learned very early on they had to get you to commit a little crime, a bad thing.
[02:57:21.890 --> 02:57:22.850]  Or you'll tell on each other.
[02:57:22.890 --> 02:57:25.352]  And then soon you were lining children up, blowing their heads off.
[02:57:26.812 --> 02:57:27.733]  It's gang mentality.
[02:57:28.053 --> 02:57:34.475]  Why do they have a Eastside vato here in Austin go knock over an innocent old lady to become an inter-maid member?
[02:57:35.975 --> 02:57:36.876]  Now they have dirt on them.
[02:57:36.916 --> 02:57:38.156]  Now they've proven they're ruthless.
[02:57:38.496 --> 02:57:41.557]  Now they've proven they're part of the gang, and that's their weird little subculture.
[02:57:41.797 --> 02:57:43.538]  When you look at police, it's gang psychology.
[02:57:44.338 --> 02:57:45.318]  You're exactly right.
[02:57:45.778 --> 02:57:54.441]  And that's what happened to me, and that's what's still happening to law enforcement, because there's not a checks and balances that there should be.
[02:57:56.042 --> 02:58:02.405]  Continuing through some of the things you've done, some of the things you've witnessed, the most important points.
[02:58:04.125 --> 02:58:07.026]  As far as being a police officer or an activist?
[02:58:07.066 --> 02:58:08.347]  I mean, kind of your story.
[02:58:11.308 --> 02:58:16.150]  I don't want to feel like I'm repeating anything, but I started out as one of the nation's top drug cops.
[02:58:17.251 --> 02:58:24.795]  Uh, raiding houses and seeing kids harmed by my police efforts and then I realized it was my ego.
[02:58:25.155 --> 02:58:27.777]  I loved the same being on news.
[02:58:27.897 --> 02:58:31.298]  I enjoy being on the news now, but the motive's different.
[02:58:31.558 --> 02:58:31.799]  Yeah.
[02:58:32.239 --> 02:58:35.941]  See, and, uh, my motive now is to get the prisoners out.
[02:58:36.972 --> 02:58:41.615]  And whatever it takes, and we have some plans up our sleeves, and I know the psychology of the cops.
[02:58:41.675 --> 02:58:48.439]  For instance, what you were talking about, how they have you do something bad so each other won't get told on?
[02:58:49.320 --> 02:58:58.146]  Well, I used knowing that against the police recently, I had a bomb that I was going to drop on the Odessa case on the internet.
[02:58:58.922 --> 02:59:00.727]  But I didn't drop it right away.
[02:59:00.867 --> 02:59:08.085]  I held it and I announced Monday I will be revealing some information that will get at least one of the cops involved fired.
[02:59:09.022 --> 02:59:15.546]  Well, the reason I didn't release that till later is because all the cops read that on that blog, and now they're worried.
[02:59:15.747 --> 02:59:16.587]  Who's telling on me?
[02:59:16.867 --> 02:59:23.732]  So I got them fighting against each other for that short amount of time, and that's when cops start telling on cops.
[02:59:24.272 --> 02:59:28.675]  They will tell on each other if you put enough pressure on one or two of them.
[02:59:28.715 --> 02:59:36.881]  And part of our Copbusters saga is to get some of these police to be our informants to turn over other cops.
[02:59:37.702 --> 02:59:43.926]  I only had three men out of the 800 I arrested that I can remember that I couldn't flip into an informant.
[02:59:44.766 --> 02:59:48.909]  I flipped everybody into an informant, and I'm going to do the same with the police.
[02:59:49.629 --> 03:00:03.858]  I'm going to catch a cop with a little bit of cocaine with our cameras and then explain to him, look, if I air this, you'll lose your job, your wife, you'll probably go to jail, or you can help me set up a cop over here doing 10 kilos of cocaine.
[03:00:04.744 --> 03:00:14.515]  So I'm going to use the same tactics the government taught me that I use to put citizens in a cage, and I'm going to flip that around on them.
[03:00:16.007 --> 03:00:18.449]  Because they're causing the true harm on Americans.
[03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:19.269]  Well, they're the ones doing it.
[03:00:19.289 --> 03:00:26.713]  Hell, I can't drive from here to my own house without worrying about going into a cage, because I have a joint in my ashtray.
[03:00:26.874 --> 03:00:30.516]  But you can have cases of beer, and it's no problem.
[03:00:30.536 --> 03:00:31.516]  And I'm a good parent.
[03:00:31.576 --> 03:00:32.697]  I don't belong in a cage.
[03:00:32.717 --> 03:00:33.398]  Well, let's go back.
[03:00:33.438 --> 03:00:40.222]  Let's go back to what you said about, it's the law, so I'm going to put this kid with some marijuana in a jail cell and let him get raped.
[03:00:41.082 --> 03:00:44.984]  But wait a minute, but then they don't bust the jail guards that are raping the children.
[03:00:45.024 --> 03:00:47.125]  They selectively don't, even though it's the law.
[03:00:48.186 --> 03:00:51.527]  The Texas Rangers went, caught them, and they were told by the higher-ups, you're not doing anything.
[03:00:52.028 --> 03:00:53.108]  It makes no sense.
[03:00:53.148 --> 03:00:55.489]  I mean, look, your boss is shipping in.
[03:00:56.090 --> 03:00:58.371]  There's this local police officer who has a radio show.
[03:00:59.679 --> 03:01:00.299]  I've heard him on air.
[03:01:00.319 --> 03:01:02.981]  There's certain talk show hosts around here who say the government ships drugs.
[03:01:03.382 --> 03:01:04.482]  I just can't believe it.
[03:01:04.822 --> 03:01:05.523]  That's made up.
[03:01:06.003 --> 03:01:08.505]  There's been thousands of cases where they've been caught.
[03:01:09.786 --> 03:01:16.831]  Huge cases where they catch 18 wheelers full of drugs and the FBI just comes and takes it and keeps it, or police steal it out of the lockups, or that plane
[03:01:19.112 --> 03:01:36.549]  I wonder if he would believe that the narcotics investigator, the DA's narcotics investigator for Yoakum County, here in Texas, current narcotics investigator, secretly sold me
[03:01:38.050 --> 03:01:40.051]  The drug dog false alerting.
[03:01:40.291 --> 03:01:45.874]  I paid him $1,300 for that and I used that footage in traffic stops and he knew what it was for.
[03:01:46.414 --> 03:01:57.059]  And then a year later, he took his illegal FLIR camera and went and FLIR'd a grow room for me and I paid him $1,000 for that and that footage is in my Never Get Busted.
[03:01:57.499 --> 03:01:59.460]  And I burnt him for this reason.
[03:02:00.201 --> 03:02:04.243]  As he was paying me for the footage to teach people how to get by police
[03:02:05.263 --> 03:02:22.217]  Uh, without going into a cage, he was announcing to the media, you can look it up on the internet, the AP articles, his name's Richard Dixon, he was telling the press, well Barry was one of the top narcotics officers, but he's just making these films now for the money.
[03:02:23.291 --> 03:02:26.774]  The whole time he had $2,300 in his pocket helping me make that film.
[03:02:26.794 --> 03:02:27.955]  Well, they always say that.
[03:02:27.975 --> 03:02:31.658]  That's the hypocrisy of our men in blue right now.
[03:02:31.718 --> 03:02:36.061]  And listen, it's not, oh, well, there's a few bad apples and the rest are good.
[03:02:36.521 --> 03:02:38.663]  That might have been back in the 50s or 40s.
[03:02:38.723 --> 03:02:39.023]  I don't know.
[03:02:39.043 --> 03:02:40.004]  I didn't live back then.
[03:02:40.044 --> 03:02:41.185]  But that's not today.
[03:02:41.665 --> 03:02:43.206]  The majority of them are corrupt.
[03:02:43.247 --> 03:02:51.273]  And I'll go as far to say all of them are corrupt because they're working with a corrupt penal code that's against the Constitution.
[03:02:53.231 --> 03:03:01.574]  A test of a society's freedoms is how many are in jail and how many are not.
[03:03:01.654 --> 03:03:02.875]  And we failed that test!
[03:03:03.015 --> 03:03:04.675]  We have more than any other nation in the world.
[03:03:04.795 --> 03:03:05.296]  In the whole world!
[03:03:05.316 --> 03:03:05.816]  I want to explain.
[03:03:05.876 --> 03:03:08.617]  China has a billion, 400 million people and they have less than us.
[03:03:08.637 --> 03:03:10.838]  Now, I want to go back to something you were saying because it's so important.
[03:03:13.139 --> 03:03:15.940]  Just as, you know, I mean just expanding on that.
[03:03:16.220 --> 03:03:18.581]  Rosa Parks, you know, arresting her saying it's the law.
[03:03:21.860 --> 03:03:26.742]  The police know, and I've talked to a lot of them, they know that most of the narcotics are brought in by the federal government.
[03:03:28.063 --> 03:03:36.067]  Again, I mean, this is a joke, and I don't like pulling up to a checkpoint and having cops ask me if I've got drugs, because I don't use them.
[03:03:36.427 --> 03:03:38.648]  Other than this coffee right here, it's probably just about as bad.
[03:03:40.929 --> 03:03:41.969]  So by that I mean illegal things.
[03:03:41.989 --> 03:03:45.151]  I don't use prescription, illegal, though I did take a
[03:03:47.449 --> 03:03:52.291]  One of those anti-allergy over-the-counter things, what Claritin this morning, because of the Cedar fever around here.
[03:03:52.611 --> 03:03:56.593]  But anyways, I mean it's just, I can't believe they sit around making excuses.
[03:03:56.853 --> 03:04:00.154]  So because you were a top narcotics officer and you were in this culture, let me understand this.
[03:04:01.995 --> 03:04:09.378]  So when they get up on the news and they were trying to help the children, were trying to fight drugs, they consciously know it's just a big business and they're just mercenary pirates?
[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:13.682]  I'm not sure, it depends on what level they're at.
[03:04:13.922 --> 03:04:16.284]  The guys in top government know that.
[03:04:16.985 --> 03:04:25.852]  The lower guys in the task force, like I was, somehow I really believed I was saving a kid from getting this marijuana on a playground somewhere.
[03:04:26.033 --> 03:04:27.714]  Because I had been told that.
[03:04:28.014 --> 03:04:35.621]  But through several years of investigation, I'm like, you know, I've never caught one person on a playground trying to sell our kids drugs.
[03:04:36.221 --> 03:04:41.784]  And to come to think about it, I don't know of any kids that have died of an overdose in my community.
[03:04:42.185 --> 03:04:43.626]  It's just not true.
[03:04:43.646 --> 03:04:44.606]  Well, I'll tell you another story.
[03:04:45.146 --> 03:04:56.073]  When I was in sixth grade, and again, I knew people dealing drugs, but to housewives and people, you know, older kids, big brothers, and I told you the story about once I was in high school, they called me in and said, we know you're stealing stereos.
[03:04:56.133 --> 03:04:57.074]  I said, I don't steal anything.
[03:04:57.094 --> 03:04:57.974]  I'm not known for that.
[03:04:57.994 --> 03:04:58.515]  What are you talking about?
[03:04:58.535 --> 03:05:00.296]  They said, look, you're going to inform for us.
[03:05:00.336 --> 03:05:01.957]  And I said, I'm not involved with anything.
[03:05:01.997 --> 03:05:03.498]  And they got real mad.
[03:05:03.938 --> 03:05:04.999]  When I was in sixth grade,
[03:05:06.018 --> 03:05:06.998]  They were doing this to a lot of kids.
[03:05:07.018 --> 03:05:08.659]  It wasn't just me that this was being singled out.
[03:05:09.439 --> 03:05:13.600]  They would have another kid come over and say, I want you to sell me marijuana.
[03:05:13.661 --> 03:05:14.641]  I know you've got marijuana.
[03:05:14.681 --> 03:05:24.004]  And for week after week after week after week asked me, and I was just now learning that there were 6th and 7th graders who had big brothers or whatever, you know, who could get marijuana.
[03:05:24.864 --> 03:05:31.266]  And I'll never forget, finally after months of this kid asking me, I said, well, Bobby over here, I don't remember the kid's name,
[03:05:34.209 --> 03:05:49.858]  You know I think he can do it just talk to him and then a month later I heard there's a big drug bust and you know the news and the parents are all concerned and the little kid brought a roach to sell the other kid who was their little informant because they kept begging there was no drugs in there.
[03:05:50.318 --> 03:05:55.341]  There was no but they wanted to say our intermediate sixth seventh grade or middle school
[03:05:56.081 --> 03:05:58.043]  Yeah, it was 6th, 7th, 8th grade in the same complex.
[03:05:58.283 --> 03:05:59.445]  There's drugs everywhere.
[03:05:59.685 --> 03:06:00.206]  There weren't.
[03:06:00.906 --> 03:06:04.170]  I mean, but it turned out this kid was going around to everybody.
[03:06:04.190 --> 03:06:05.531]  I mean, I'm in the football field house.
[03:06:05.571 --> 03:06:06.973]  He's going, I hear you got marijuana.
[03:06:06.993 --> 03:06:07.513]  I hear you're dealing.
[03:06:07.533 --> 03:06:09.115]  I'm like, no, I don't.
[03:06:09.796 --> 03:06:10.757]  You know, I don't.
[03:06:10.777 --> 03:06:12.138]  I mean, I wasn't even smoking pot at that time.
[03:06:13.787 --> 03:06:15.788]  That's our parents' fault and our grandparents' fault.
[03:06:15.828 --> 03:06:19.530]  They should have been up at the school saying, whoa, you're adults.
[03:06:19.550 --> 03:06:21.371]  You're not going to act like this over a roach.
[03:06:21.411 --> 03:06:22.611]  He shouldn't have brought it to school.
[03:06:22.872 --> 03:06:25.313]  And what cops got him to do this anyway?
[03:06:25.333 --> 03:06:29.074]  And then all the parents go to the police station and say, you're not going to treat our kids like that?
[03:06:29.155 --> 03:06:31.616]  They bust the one little kid for the roach or whatever.
[03:06:32.716 --> 03:06:36.158]  They call me into the office and they say, admit you were involved in the drug deal.
[03:06:36.798 --> 03:06:42.083]  And I said, I said, you guys know that you had that other kid, you know, come over and do this.
[03:06:42.143 --> 03:06:43.344]  And I guess there were so many people.
[03:06:43.364 --> 03:06:46.548]  I mean, I didn't know I was smart when I was in sixth grade, but I'll never forget.
[03:06:47.543 --> 03:06:48.584]  Anyways, I'm taking up all the time.
[03:06:49.925 --> 03:06:54.328]  They then sent me back to class and then the next day called my dad and said, we need you to come here.
[03:06:54.788 --> 03:06:59.851]  And they were like asking my dad in the meeting, how does he know to say no to all this?
[03:06:59.991 --> 03:07:00.972]  What's he involved in?
[03:07:01.272 --> 03:07:02.453]  What are you involved in?
[03:07:03.694 --> 03:07:05.575]  But anyways, but it wasn't just me.
[03:07:05.975 --> 03:07:13.340]  The whole school was about harassing and trying to get, and now kids get in a fist fight, they get arrested instead of just being broken up.
[03:07:14.281 --> 03:07:17.382]  Bring a coach in and let the boys box it out a little bit.
[03:07:17.422 --> 03:07:20.003]  But I mean, exactly, the schools are the zero tolerance.
[03:07:20.264 --> 03:07:27.507]  Did you see the LA Times where the woman, her two children were fighting with each other in the aisle before takeoff?
[03:07:27.807 --> 03:07:38.971]  They knocked over her Bloody Mary and she slapped one on the leg and then they came over and said for spilling that and that slap, terrorism, and she's now been convicted under the USA Patriot Act and is going to serve ten years in prison.
[03:07:38.991 --> 03:07:39.512]  Did you see that?
[03:07:39.592 --> 03:07:40.832]  God, that's sad.
[03:07:40.912 --> 03:07:42.173]  Right there, charges a terrorist.
[03:07:42.993 --> 03:07:43.133]  L.A.
[03:07:43.153 --> 03:07:43.433]  Times.
[03:07:43.494 --> 03:07:44.674]  Okay, that's crazy.
[03:07:44.975 --> 03:07:48.898]  And that brings up a point that there's a principle that I have debates with.
[03:07:48.938 --> 03:07:50.078]  There's a lot of these teachers.
[03:07:50.099 --> 03:07:52.640]  When I mentioned it's not the kids' fault, it's the parents.
[03:07:53.081 --> 03:07:55.923]  They're teachers for some reason, not all of the teachers.
[03:07:55.983 --> 03:07:57.264]  Both of my parents are teachers.
[03:07:57.584 --> 03:08:00.086]  My dad, a math teacher, has been teaching for 20 years.
[03:08:00.446 --> 03:08:03.088]  My mother's a computer teacher, has been teaching for 15 years.
[03:08:03.389 --> 03:08:06.631]  They're both in public schools teaching, so I know what y'all are up against.
[03:08:06.671 --> 03:08:07.592]  But unfortunately,
[03:08:08.232 --> 03:08:10.075]  A lot of the teachers have developed this attitude.
[03:08:10.095 --> 03:08:10.896]  These kids are crazy.
[03:08:10.937 --> 03:08:11.858]  What's wrong with these kids?
[03:08:12.339 --> 03:08:16.926]  It's not the teachers against the kids.
[03:08:17.507 --> 03:08:23.456]  The teachers are there to provide a learning and safe environment for those kids.
[03:08:23.516 --> 03:08:32.907]  Well, I mean, I remember having teachers that I didn't respect because they were mean and then there was always the cool teacher everybody loved and nobody misbehaved because they were a real teacher and they commanded that audience.
[03:08:33.188 --> 03:08:33.508]  Right.
[03:08:33.648 --> 03:08:38.674]  So, so, you know, this kicking kids out of out of school because they can't
[03:08:39.455 --> 03:08:40.316]  Make a C?
[03:08:59.238 --> 03:09:02.159]  Tell you the difference between a gerund and a participle.
[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:06.121]  And he can't factor in polynomials on each side.
[03:09:06.522 --> 03:09:09.383]  But he is a hell of a mechanic and can play football.
[03:09:09.843 --> 03:09:13.225]  So let's get him in a class and teach him those mechanic skills.
[03:09:13.725 --> 03:09:20.048]  And don't kick him out of football where there are coaches that can love and help this man and keep him off drugs.
[03:09:20.529 --> 03:09:22.029]  There's a reason we're losing 50%.
[03:09:23.730 --> 03:09:25.631]  Of our kids in high school across America!
[03:09:25.691 --> 03:09:26.251]  And the social engineers!
[03:09:26.291 --> 03:09:32.513]  Here's the sick thing, and I know you're very well informed, but we have a book this thick, the size of an Austin phone book, not as big as the Dallas.
[03:09:33.134 --> 03:09:35.094]  She was the head of policy, Department of Education.
[03:09:35.735 --> 03:09:38.936]  Dad's skull and bones, you know, elite blue blood.
[03:09:39.756 --> 03:09:49.682]  And they called her in and they said, we're here to destroy the family, we're here to dumb them down, we're here to make school horrible, we're here to get them in the criminal justice system, because we're institutionalizing America to control them.
[03:09:49.722 --> 03:09:50.502]  I'm serious.
[03:09:50.582 --> 03:09:51.403]  It worked.
[03:09:52.163 --> 03:09:53.724]  Can you think how cold-blooded that is?
[03:09:54.305 --> 03:09:59.428]  That for 60 years they've been doing that to make kids want to drop out, to make them not be able to learn.
[03:09:59.448 --> 03:10:00.488]  Of course the teachers don't know.
[03:10:00.728 --> 03:10:03.110]  They're compartmentalized having to deal with what they've been given.
[03:10:05.171 --> 03:10:10.015]  Well, not only that, that system attracts the type of teacher that can work in that.
[03:10:10.495 --> 03:10:17.060]  Just like the police system attracts the type of human being that can work under those circumstances.
[03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:20.522]  We have teachers in this land that are not in our public schools.
[03:10:20.662 --> 03:10:24.725]  I mean, good, qualified, heartfelt teachers.
[03:10:24.745 --> 03:10:25.205]  Well, they get run out.
[03:10:25.225 --> 03:10:26.446]  Yeah, they get run out!
[03:10:26.506 --> 03:10:29.528]  They get ran out of our education system in America.
[03:10:29.548 --> 03:10:31.710]  My grandmother was like an award-winning top teacher.
[03:10:33.211 --> 03:10:39.076]  You know, master's degree in teaching, and she got out of teaching early because she just said the school system won't let me teach.
[03:10:40.637 --> 03:10:41.598]  You're exactly right.
[03:10:41.878 --> 03:10:43.460]  You know, we have those problems.
[03:10:43.500 --> 03:10:51.466]  So, again, it's neat how Americans, this is not just, Candy and I are not just about legalizing pot.
[03:10:51.506 --> 03:10:52.487]  It's a freedom issue.
[03:10:52.527 --> 03:10:53.568]  We're big on families.
[03:10:53.928 --> 03:11:00.013]  We're big on, we have the same problems every normal American family has, and we have the same joys.
[03:11:00.942 --> 03:11:07.965]  And the same fears and the same emotions that the listeners feel right now in their own homes.
[03:11:08.525 --> 03:11:10.446]  And this is a new America coming through.
[03:11:10.466 --> 03:11:19.570]  Alex, we have activists such as yourself, Kevin Booth, Mark Emery in Canada, what we're doing, and I really believe
[03:11:20.390 --> 03:11:26.115]  The network is being connected and we are going to see some changes in America shortly.
[03:11:26.155 --> 03:11:28.717]  It's going to go one way or the other and I'm believing it's going to go our way.
[03:11:28.737 --> 03:11:32.380]  Have you ever met Mark Stavnoski, the former Dallas Cowboys center?
[03:11:32.761 --> 03:11:33.201]  I have not.
[03:11:34.182 --> 03:11:36.043]  He's a 9-11 truther and an anti...
[03:11:37.603 --> 03:11:40.044]  You know, drug war advocate for decriminalization.
[03:11:40.084 --> 03:11:40.564]  He's a good guy.
[03:11:40.584 --> 03:11:41.404]  You should get him on the show.
[03:11:42.124 --> 03:11:50.867]  In closing, let's talk about just what it's been like for you to go from being a bad guy who didn't know it to that conversion and waking up.
[03:11:51.828 --> 03:11:56.649]  And a challenge to others that are on the dark side to know that they're on the dark side and come over to the light.
[03:11:57.229 --> 03:12:00.230]  And then a little bit more about the radio show.
[03:12:00.250 --> 03:12:01.951]  We've got to work that out and decide when to start it.
[03:12:03.051 --> 03:12:05.332]  I'm ready to start the radio show as soon as you
[03:12:06.587 --> 03:12:07.667]  Give me the green light.
[03:12:07.887 --> 03:12:14.609]  Well, Ted Anderson's releasing this extra satellite right now, because it's going to be for my system 24 hours a day in association with the network in Minnesota.
[03:12:15.770 --> 03:12:21.131]  And then I'm interviewing board ops all this week so that we have more people in there and we have to familiarize them.
[03:12:21.171 --> 03:12:21.951]  This is a different system.
[03:12:21.971 --> 03:12:26.653]  This is internet, AMFM satellite, and it's all integrated in there.
[03:12:26.693 --> 03:12:29.494]  So it's not, you can't just get a regular radio board op.
[03:12:29.514 --> 03:12:30.554]  We've got guys in there
[03:12:31.354 --> 03:12:39.656]  You know, like, one fellow runs the CBS News Show in the morning, so it's a TV director slash radio, so, and that's kind of for behind the scenes for the listeners.
[03:12:39.696 --> 03:12:42.677]  I'm not trying to get into all the technical stuff, just for folks that are interested in that.
[03:12:43.077 --> 03:12:46.298]  And soon we're going to have a tour via video camera of the office to show people.
[03:12:46.318 --> 03:12:48.199]  Beautiful office, by the way.
[03:12:48.459 --> 03:12:48.859]  Very nice.
[03:12:49.159 --> 03:12:49.679]  Well, thank you.
[03:12:49.939 --> 03:12:56.801]  And no, it's just people keep wanting to see our new office, and they're like, you know, let's see what you're building, let's see what you're doing, and I'm so busy I haven't gotten around to it.
[03:12:57.601 --> 03:13:02.687]  But you guys want to shoot for not this Saturday, but are you going to be in town next Saturday?
[03:13:03.228 --> 03:13:05.130]  Candy, we'd have to find out.
[03:13:05.190 --> 03:13:06.952]  Yeah, Saturday sounds great.
[03:13:06.992 --> 03:13:09.395]  I mean, we've been talking about programming.
[03:13:09.816 --> 03:13:14.862]  Wouldn't a nine to midnight show be really good for what he's doing on Saturday night?
[03:13:16.640 --> 03:13:20.324]  I mean, I think that's the best time for that.
[03:13:20.584 --> 03:13:22.466]  But, you know, you could probably even do it earlier in the day.
[03:13:23.647 --> 03:13:26.630]  But that's the best time, I think, a Saturday or Sunday night.
[03:13:27.411 --> 03:13:29.313]  And we've got a new show starting in about a month.
[03:13:29.393 --> 03:13:32.676]  It's going to be on weeknights, Monday through Friday, out of this studio.
[03:13:34.498 --> 03:13:37.020]  But I believe within two weeks.
[03:13:38.063 --> 03:13:40.805]  They're going to have the satellite all hooked up and then we have to integrate in those systems.
[03:13:40.825 --> 03:13:45.148]  We have to develop a video intro for your show and things like that.
[03:13:45.188 --> 03:13:47.931]  So there's a few little odds and ends.
[03:13:48.171 --> 03:13:51.513]  Or we can start pretty much immediately with a beta test.
[03:13:52.494 --> 03:13:55.857]  It's just I want to have your graphics and a whole package of things.
[03:13:55.877 --> 03:13:58.439]  There's going to be some behind the scenes work we've got to do for that.
[03:13:59.199 --> 03:13:59.540]  Excellent.
[03:14:00.721 --> 03:14:05.587]  I think you asked me a question earlier.
[03:14:05.607 --> 03:14:06.067]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:14:06.107 --> 03:14:09.912]  How do I feel now, moving over to the side of light?
[03:14:10.412 --> 03:14:12.214]  I feel better than I've ever felt.
[03:14:13.112 --> 03:14:15.073]  I'm more balanced than I ever felt.
[03:14:15.093 --> 03:14:22.337]  I'm more at peace with myself than I've ever felt because I know for sure this time I'm doing the right thing.
[03:14:23.217 --> 03:14:31.281]  And we've caught some breaks and we've worked hard and we used wisdom to make sure we'd be on the map two years later.
[03:14:33.863 --> 03:14:37.046]  Some really good people are getting in position to be around us.
[03:14:37.867 --> 03:14:40.189]  The people that started with us are still here.
[03:14:40.509 --> 03:14:41.470]  They're full of wisdom.
[03:14:41.990 --> 03:14:46.494]  So we don't just climb and leave people behind.
[03:14:46.554 --> 03:14:48.215]  We're a team that's going forward.
[03:14:49.236 --> 03:14:55.159]  I still carry some hurt, I don't know if you call it guilt or what, for hurting the people that I harmed.
[03:14:55.399 --> 03:14:57.540]  You know, I'll carry that my whole life.
[03:14:57.560 --> 03:14:58.920]  The more good you do, the more good you do.
[03:14:58.940 --> 03:15:02.942]  Yeah, you can cancel out a lot of that stuff by putting good stuff out.
[03:15:02.982 --> 03:15:07.744]  So, you know, doing what we set out to do, and that's to do good.
[03:15:08.325 --> 03:15:08.885]  And it's working.
[03:15:09.824 --> 03:15:10.424]  Absolutely.
[03:15:10.464 --> 03:15:12.485]  I tell you, I feel so sorry for folks that are evil.
[03:15:13.005 --> 03:15:17.087]  Because I was never really evil, but I was kind of being a tough guy and kind of an a-hole, as they say.
[03:15:17.107 --> 03:15:18.227]  And I wasn't happy.
[03:15:18.247 --> 03:15:23.409]  And as soon as I became, you know, a more loving person and more wisdom, it takes time.
[03:15:23.429 --> 03:15:29.551]  That's why the system targets children, or targets young cops, or targets young teachers, to indoctrinate them.
[03:15:29.571 --> 03:15:31.292]  That's why they want soldiers that are 18, not 30.
[03:15:31.572 --> 03:15:34.493]  You know, because they want them when they don't know, when they're not wise.
[03:15:34.533 --> 03:15:36.614]  A 30-year-old will tell them, hey, don't talk to me like that.
[03:15:38.794 --> 03:15:40.675]  Or they'll say, I'm not going to take that vaccine.
[03:15:40.735 --> 03:15:42.976]  Army regs say I don't have to take experimental vaccines.
[03:15:43.716 --> 03:15:46.458]  But an 18-20 year old doesn't know and they can warp their minds early.
[03:15:46.718 --> 03:15:47.798]  That's what concerns me most.
[03:15:48.719 --> 03:15:52.840]  They found in World War I that a soldier could only fight for maximum a year.
[03:15:52.960 --> 03:16:05.486]  And then the majority of the time they were going to be messed up for life, post-traumatic stress, shell-shocked, either really aggressive and wild or just kind of, you know, screwed up and have all sorts of health problems and be mentally ill.
[03:16:06.286 --> 03:16:06.686]  We're good to go.
[03:16:24.787 --> 03:16:29.528]  You know, they have to understand that now they're serving on average three combat tours.
[03:16:29.548 --> 03:16:31.709]  They only did one in Vietnam, one in Korea.
[03:16:32.129 --> 03:16:35.210]  When my grandfather served a tour, you know, he was a volunteer, but it was only one tour.
[03:16:35.570 --> 03:16:40.932]  You know, flying B-17s and then getting a Purple Heart and then being on the ground, being a cook in Italy once they invaded.
[03:16:41.752 --> 03:16:44.793]  You know, and I mean, I look back to how my dad's dad was.
[03:16:44.833 --> 03:16:49.574]  He was a business guy and, you know, in the county government, a good guy, a rancher and a farmer, a nice fellow.
[03:16:49.914 --> 03:16:51.555]  But, you know, he died really young and he was
[03:16:52.671 --> 03:16:54.092]  I mean you can tell probably had a little bit of that.
[03:16:54.452 --> 03:16:55.653]  That was only from one tour.
[03:16:56.253 --> 03:17:05.479]  Imagine three, four, five, six tours and these guys are shot out of their minds and now they're coming in as cops and they're the guys that are shooting people in the back.
[03:17:05.720 --> 03:17:13.385]  They're the guys that are, I mean there's this one military veteran who's well known to also be a steroid head here in town who became a supervisor out of there, proud of him.
[03:17:13.985 --> 03:17:18.927]  You know, I mean, I know somebody who he threw out of, he pulled up, pulled the guy over.
[03:17:19.007 --> 03:17:20.167]  The guy's quadriplegic.
[03:17:20.488 --> 03:17:22.528]  He says, what are these things on your car?
[03:17:23.008 --> 03:17:24.269]  And he said, those are my hand controls.
[03:17:24.289 --> 03:17:24.869]  He said, get out.
[03:17:25.609 --> 03:17:29.511]  And they beat him up on the squad car camera and they said, hey, good job.
[03:17:29.591 --> 03:17:30.231]  Here's a medal.
[03:17:31.192 --> 03:17:33.252]  Again, it's like they're devil dogs or something.
[03:17:33.492 --> 03:17:37.414]  When I graduated the police academy, I was afraid of citizens.
[03:17:38.851 --> 03:17:45.994]  And I'll tell more on another show, but some of the training exercises... Well, if you've got the time, we can go another... We can go another five minutes.
[03:17:46.014 --> 03:17:47.255]  Go ahead and tell the story.
[03:17:47.375 --> 03:17:59.080]  One of the training exercises that we went through was with a paint pistol, and our instructor sat in a car as the driver, and we did a mock traffic stop.
[03:18:00.141 --> 03:18:06.004]  And he had the gun hidden, and the goal was to not get shot by him.
[03:18:07.122 --> 03:18:18.087]  And through this exercise we're trained that every encounter with a citizen is an armed encounter, whether they have a gun or not, because the officer has a gun that can be taken.
[03:18:18.907 --> 03:18:23.749]  So they teach us all these different paranoid ways how to approach a car.
[03:18:25.563 --> 03:18:48.075]  And we've gotten shot by the paintball so many times from our instructors that by the time we get out of the police academy and make our first traffic stop, I think I've got courage and I'm kind of a brave guy, but my hand would be shaking so bad before I got to that driver's door pulling anybody home over.
[03:18:48.115 --> 03:18:49.216]  Little old lady, didn't matter.
[03:18:49.756 --> 03:18:53.100]  My hands would be shaking so bad thinking, where's the gun going to come from?
[03:18:53.140 --> 03:18:54.181]  Where's the gun going to come from?
[03:18:54.201 --> 03:19:09.897]  Well, see, I always wondered why, starting in the late 90s, no, no, mid 90s, cops pull you over now and they walk over all scared and all, and you're just going, you know, and I mean, and now I see them, because I'll observe them, I see them pulling over literally like 65 year old women and they're scared.
[03:19:10.598 --> 03:19:12.859]  And then I know the statistics, because I'm all into statistics.
[03:19:13.499 --> 03:19:19.401]  I know that a handful of police die compared to dying in car wrecks when they're writing tickets, hanging their butts out, like I said last time.
[03:19:20.161 --> 03:19:23.322]  And, you know, you tell a cop that, you go, you know, your main thing is your squad car.
[03:19:23.682 --> 03:19:24.402]  The main thing is getting hit.
[03:19:24.422 --> 03:19:26.163]  And they're like, no, it's the citizens.
[03:19:26.183 --> 03:19:26.683]  They're deadly.
[03:19:26.783 --> 03:19:27.763]  You know, they're deadly.
[03:19:28.163 --> 03:19:30.404]  And, you know, cops do get killed, but that's part of the line of work.
[03:19:30.464 --> 03:19:31.324]  Firemen get killed.
[03:19:31.904 --> 03:19:34.445]  I just can't imagine constantly being that afraid.
[03:19:34.545 --> 03:19:36.766]  That is abuse of their body right there.
[03:19:37.566 --> 03:19:38.846]  Well, it's the air.
[03:19:40.147 --> 03:19:48.169]  I could walk into a scene, and it doesn't take an intelligent person to do this, it takes a manipulative person, and everybody's got some manipulation in them.
[03:19:48.809 --> 03:19:54.070]  I could walk into a scene, calm it down, help the citizens, and leave.
[03:19:54.630 --> 03:20:02.572]  Or I could walk into that same scene as an officer and do little things to antagonize and pick fights to escalate that into an arrest.
[03:20:03.962 --> 03:20:06.723]  That's what the cops are doing!
[03:20:06.743 --> 03:20:09.285]  I've had them do that as activists.
[03:20:09.765 --> 03:20:13.647]  In Denver, and they weren't as bad as some cities, I'd be there videoing during the DNC.
[03:20:14.207 --> 03:20:17.729]  Cops would come over 30 feet away and say, hey, we're just working here, stop taping us.
[03:20:18.250 --> 03:20:19.530]  I'd go, hey man, it's the First Amendment.
[03:20:19.790 --> 03:20:21.111]  Hey, what's your problem?
[03:20:21.411 --> 03:20:22.752]  Where did that attitude come from?
[03:20:23.695 --> 03:20:25.998]  Well, they're not secret police, and they think they are.
[03:20:26.038 --> 03:20:27.099]  They're public servants.
[03:20:27.179 --> 03:20:29.142]  It's just an entire paradigm shift.
[03:20:29.322 --> 03:20:36.331]  As I said last week, police now show up to the scene looking who they can arrest.
[03:20:36.792 --> 03:20:42.279]  And we need to switch the whole thing to police showing up to the scene looking who they can help.
[03:20:42.759 --> 03:20:53.287]  Did you hear about this Fourth Amendment change, where they said, well, even if officers don't really have a proper warrant, or even if it wasn't properly filed, or even if they lie about it, they can now just, basically no Fourth Amendment.
[03:20:53.868 --> 03:21:09.140]  Yeah, but when that came out, that confused me a little bit, because I've been involved in lawsuits, and even if there's immunity given to police officers and judges, if their intentions weren't to cause harm.
[03:21:09.360 --> 03:21:12.363]  No, no, now it's, you know, they spun it for the public that was protectable.
[03:21:12.443 --> 03:21:13.964]  No, it's saying they can do bad things now.
[03:21:14.805 --> 03:21:16.026]  I mean, that's what the ruling's saying.
[03:21:16.726 --> 03:21:17.467]  That's insane.
[03:21:17.707 --> 03:21:18.568]  No, no, it's evil.
[03:21:18.648 --> 03:21:19.348]  Look, they're evil.
[03:21:19.389 --> 03:21:28.817]  I mean, that's what, every time you see in criminology where there's some nice family man who likes to dress up like a clown, they find out there's 23 dead boys in his basement.
[03:21:29.457 --> 03:21:30.897]  And they're like, but he was such a nice man.
[03:21:31.637 --> 03:21:33.838]  And it's because they wear suits and ties or uniforms.
[03:21:33.898 --> 03:21:34.998]  People can't believe this.
[03:21:35.418 --> 03:21:40.099]  And if you as a mid-level narcotics officer, it was already this evil, but you thought you were okay.
[03:21:40.759 --> 03:21:43.500]  What I found is it's actually sadistic psychopaths above them.
[03:21:43.860 --> 03:21:47.101]  And there's a whole system of manipulating police and bureaucrats and others.
[03:21:47.481 --> 03:21:53.762]  And the higher you go up the chain, it goes from just being well-meaning dupes who become corrupt, but rationalize it.
[03:21:54.782 --> 03:21:56.204]  To controlled psychopaths.
[03:21:56.244 --> 03:21:56.905]  You know that term?
[03:21:57.265 --> 03:22:03.233]  You know, the stupid psychopath goes out and just grabs a kid off a schoolyard and goes and rapes them in the woods and gets caught an hour later.
[03:22:03.573 --> 03:22:06.217]  A controlled psychopath, like the Zodiac, never gets caught.
[03:22:06.557 --> 03:22:09.020]  Well, the government's full of Zodiacs.
[03:22:09.421 --> 03:22:12.184]  They're full of genius-level, intelligent, focused...
[03:22:13.265 --> 03:22:19.648]  And notice when they do bust some of these high-level psychopaths, it'll be some high-level government bureaucrat, or some Homeland Security Deputy Director.
[03:22:20.188 --> 03:22:22.469]  And they're writing letters to the newspaper.
[03:22:22.489 --> 03:22:23.309]  You'll never catch me.
[03:22:23.329 --> 03:22:23.929]  Remember that guy?
[03:22:24.870 --> 03:22:27.371]  But anyways, it's... Well, so here's what Americans do.
[03:22:27.591 --> 03:22:31.012]  We talk the problem a lot, and we need to, but there is an answer.
[03:22:31.072 --> 03:22:32.153]  If you live in America now,
[03:22:33.112 --> 03:22:36.354]  You're not free, but you can survive in America.
[03:22:36.374 --> 03:22:39.455]  And the way you do that is arm yourself with information.
[03:22:39.995 --> 03:22:42.976]  And I'm not plugging these videos right now, but they help.
[03:22:43.016 --> 03:22:44.777]  Hey, we need the funds to grow and be big.
[03:22:44.817 --> 03:22:46.258]  Go to InfoWars.com and get them.
[03:22:46.338 --> 03:22:47.458]  InfoWars.com.
[03:22:47.518 --> 03:22:49.719]  These have a lot of good information.
[03:22:49.819 --> 03:22:50.520]  And then remember,
[03:22:51.580 --> 03:23:01.249]  I have some forums that are free on NeverGetBusted.com that give a lot of information how to survive these police encounters.
[03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:07.115]  You've got all these questions, all these important points and there's all these big... That citizens have asked and I got on there and answered.
[03:23:07.155 --> 03:23:08.936]  There's thousands of questions.
[03:23:08.976 --> 03:23:13.520]  The questions you always wanted to ask a cop and get an honest answer, they're there.
[03:23:14.381 --> 03:23:21.948]  And your weapons of warfare are cameras, the internet, supporting other activists... Yes, growing our numbers!
[03:23:21.988 --> 03:23:26.392]  Yeah, you can do something, because... I want to end with this, if I've got a little bit of time.
[03:23:26.412 --> 03:23:28.574]  No, you've got time, go ahead.
[03:23:29.655 --> 03:23:32.117]  The New America, what Kanye and I call the New America,
[03:23:33.191 --> 03:23:38.993]  We should concentrate on rallying the people who already get it.
[03:23:40.033 --> 03:23:50.737]  Sometimes I think we spend too much of our time as activists arguing with a 50, 60 year old grandpa that is not going to get it and you're beating your head on the wall.
[03:23:51.637 --> 03:23:53.978]  Don't waste your energy with those people anymore.
[03:23:55.461 --> 03:23:58.963]  The grave will take care of them, and that's sad, but the grave needs to take care of them.
[03:23:58.983 --> 03:23:59.183]  No, I agree.
[03:23:59.203 --> 03:24:00.744]  You've got to move on to those that want to hear it.
[03:24:00.764 --> 03:24:01.285]  That's right.
[03:24:01.325 --> 03:24:03.786]  Let's rally the people who already get it.
[03:24:04.287 --> 03:24:09.950]  There's millions of us out here that already understand this, so let's use our energy.
[03:24:09.970 --> 03:24:17.875]  You know, instead of going to your grandpa and arguing with them or your father, go to your neighbor that understands it and say, hey, we can do something.
[03:24:17.875 --> 03:24:23.580]  And instead of just agreeing with the neighbor in his garage while you're sitting there drinking a beer, saying, okay, what are we going to do about this?
[03:24:23.720 --> 03:24:26.643]  Let's go down to city council and speak out against the police state checkpoints.
[03:24:27.184 --> 03:24:30.647]  Let's go out and support Barry Cooper, who's going to be running for attorney general.
[03:24:30.987 --> 03:24:37.413]  Let's go out and let's get his film and have a party and say, hey folks, come over, you know, we're cooking chicken on the grill and stuff.
[03:24:37.513 --> 03:24:40.977]  And we're going to, you know, let you see some wild stuff, some underground videos.
[03:24:41.317 --> 03:24:42.198]  Yeah, to stay safe.
[03:24:42.598 --> 03:24:47.601]  But then make it fun, not like, ooh, I got something really dirty and bad and, you know, it's dangerous and criminal.
[03:24:47.862 --> 03:24:50.543]  No, I got something really fun and wild about getting our country back.
[03:24:50.844 --> 03:24:53.726]  Come over and watch Endgame or Terror Storm and never get busted.
[03:24:53.746 --> 03:24:56.307]  You know, this is how we're going to change things.
[03:24:56.568 --> 03:25:03.512]  And that's why the federal government wants to use this fake Messiah Obama to suck in false mass movements so they can control it.
[03:25:03.552 --> 03:25:04.133]  Go ahead and close.
[03:25:04.973 --> 03:25:15.561]  Um, it's just, I really think if there's ever a time to at least get pot legalized, that'll keep a lot of people from being in a cage.
[03:25:15.961 --> 03:25:17.162]  Just that itself.
[03:25:17.462 --> 03:25:19.003]  What, 87% of drug users only use marijuana?
[03:25:19.023 --> 03:25:19.424]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:25:22.696 --> 03:25:31.540]  We're sitting on the best time to, if we join together, like we're doing, you're helping, you're giving me a show, that's huge.
[03:25:32.020 --> 03:25:43.726]  Kevin Booth, he has his own thing going, but we can use his talents, and I can help him with his plight, and I can help you with your plight, and we can all do our own thing, but join and help each other.
[03:25:43.746 --> 03:25:46.847]  Synergy, energizing each other.
[03:25:46.867 --> 03:25:49.048]  It's working too, I mean it is working.
[03:25:49.748 --> 03:25:50.689]  You do not hear
[03:25:51.449 --> 03:25:56.071]  Or, we didn't hear drug war talk at this level three years ago, like we do now.
[03:25:56.691 --> 03:25:59.192]  Attorney Generals are coming out saying now, end the drug war.
[03:25:59.212 --> 03:26:00.833]  I mean, people are catching on.
[03:26:00.893 --> 03:26:01.773]  This thing is working.
[03:26:02.374 --> 03:26:04.154]  So, just leave it at that.
[03:26:04.215 --> 03:26:05.475]  I'm excited about the new show.
[03:26:06.616 --> 03:26:07.556]  Well, I just want to be clear.
[03:26:07.576 --> 03:26:09.617]  Let's talk about that in the final close here.
[03:26:10.788 --> 03:26:13.190]  That a lot of people say to me, Alex, don't be so negative.
[03:26:13.511 --> 03:26:17.815]  I think we've gotten to this point because it's not negative if I have gangrene and I go in and get it treated.
[03:26:18.456 --> 03:26:23.741]  And I want people to know, I'm not up here telling you all these horrible things because I just want to urinate on the government.
[03:26:23.801 --> 03:26:29.227]  The government's just a collection of corporate crooks and weirdos and dumbed down people and decent folks.
[03:26:30.649 --> 03:26:40.976]  I tell people how bad it is because I researched this and I can't believe that it's as insane as it is when I read a globalist document by Richard N. Haas.
[03:26:41.016 --> 03:26:53.084]  In fact, let's end the show with Richard N. Haas on the Corberra Report where they're making jokes about world government and poo-pooing it when ten years ago the news said the CFR does not exist and it's a code that you're a terrorist.
[03:26:53.524 --> 03:27:00.329]  I have law enforcement manuals that say Council on Foreign Relations is a code for being a white supremacist.
[03:27:00.989 --> 03:27:01.330]  Okay?
[03:27:01.690 --> 03:27:05.473]  They said posse commentatus is a code for being a white supremacist.
[03:27:05.533 --> 03:27:06.294]  I have the manuals.
[03:27:06.554 --> 03:27:07.135]  I put them on the web.
[03:27:07.155 --> 03:27:07.915]  This has been on the news.
[03:27:07.936 --> 03:27:09.417]  We put it out and it's got national news.
[03:27:10.117 --> 03:27:17.264]  That's because they're treating the cops, this is FBI manuals for cops, like they're moron idiots, feeding them this fear.
[03:27:17.824 --> 03:27:23.229]  So now when a citizen sees troops out, they go, that's violation of posse commentatus, 1878 federal law.
[03:27:23.249 --> 03:27:25.411]  They go, my God, I got one of the white supremacists.
[03:27:27.722 --> 03:27:31.243]  See, I mean, look at how base that manipulation is.
[03:27:31.263 --> 03:27:36.445]  So what I'm saying to all of you out there is we have to face just how evil it is.
[03:27:36.485 --> 03:27:39.185]  You know, it's like whenever I told Barry, did you hear of this woman?
[03:27:39.205 --> 03:27:42.186]  Her kids knocked a bloody Mary over and she slapped them on the leg.
[03:27:42.747 --> 03:27:44.307]  And that's in the LA Times.
[03:27:44.347 --> 03:27:52.349]  The police say that she was charged under Patriot Act as a terrorist and not given a lawyer for three months until she pled guilty because they can do that under the anti-terror clause.
[03:27:52.910 --> 03:27:57.271]  She's not allowed to have private discussions with her lawyer and she's going to prison for over a decade.
[03:27:57.951 --> 03:28:05.258]  And they go on to say, oh, hundreds and hundreds of people for just arguing, just raising your voice, not even cussing, you go to prison as a terrorist.
[03:28:05.598 --> 03:28:10.222]  Now remember, they told you that Patriot Act was only for Al-CIA to Al-Qaeda.
[03:28:10.663 --> 03:28:11.423]  But I read the bill.
[03:28:12.532 --> 03:28:20.153]  Section 802 says any misdemeanor is an act of terrorism now, and now every state, thousands of cases a year, they're implementing this.
[03:28:20.173 --> 03:28:28.635]  But see, I feel like a liar when I just said that, because it's so crazy, I can't even believe it, but it's the LA Times!
[03:28:28.915 --> 03:28:29.355]  Look at this!
[03:28:29.675 --> 03:28:30.035]  Look at this!
[03:28:30.075 --> 03:28:32.416]  I mean, I can't believe... I mean, it's right there!
[03:28:32.716 --> 03:28:36.476]  I mean, I can't even believe... I mean, it says it right there!
[03:28:36.496 --> 03:28:37.897]  I can't even... And the police!
[03:28:38.197 --> 03:28:39.897]  The feds are in here defending it!
[03:28:40.646 --> 03:28:42.247]  Yeah, you're not making these things up.
[03:28:42.307 --> 03:28:42.927]  They're true.
[03:28:43.827 --> 03:28:51.110]  And I'm thankful you and I have the time to be a voice for some of these Americans that do have to work two jobs just to get by.
[03:28:51.590 --> 03:28:54.251]  And we are your voice, and we're fighting for you.
[03:28:55.112 --> 03:28:56.552]  And we're not going to stop.
[03:28:56.612 --> 03:29:02.455]  There are men in this country with testosterone levels, and we're using it in the right direction.
[03:29:02.475 --> 03:29:05.536]  Hey, what should we name your radio show?
[03:29:06.132 --> 03:29:06.592]  I don't know.
[03:29:06.612 --> 03:29:09.775]  I thought about the Berry and Candy Hour.
[03:29:09.795 --> 03:29:23.104]  I did, because truly my favorite thing in the world to do, anybody that knows me will tell you, I wanted to make a line of videos on how to raise a family and parenting.
[03:29:23.854 --> 03:29:27.817]  Well, what you can do is, but I think it's really hot to have the Never Get Busted radio show.
[03:29:27.897 --> 03:29:30.178]  The most hardcore phenomenon in the world.
[03:29:30.558 --> 03:29:31.719]  You want, I'll cut you some liners.
[03:29:31.739 --> 03:29:32.880]  Yeah, of course.
[03:29:34.021 --> 03:29:35.902]  I was joking with kind of a fake radio voice there.
[03:29:35.922 --> 03:29:40.985]  I can go, no, it's like Never Get Busted Again with Barry Cooper and Kendi Cooper.
[03:29:41.045 --> 03:29:46.148]  The most hard-hitting in the drug war prohibition news show out there.
[03:29:46.268 --> 03:29:46.769]  I love it.
[03:29:46.889 --> 03:29:47.229]  I love it.
[03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:49.490]  We'll write something up.
[03:29:49.510 --> 03:29:50.791]  But anyways,
[03:29:51.972 --> 03:29:53.093]  Go ahead, you were into the family thing.
[03:29:53.674 --> 03:30:03.565]  Anyway, those things are important to us because the drug war and the things Alex are talking about do affect our families.
[03:30:04.186 --> 03:30:06.909]  And I see very few happy families in America.
[03:30:07.069 --> 03:30:09.392]  I travel abroad to other countries.
[03:30:09.412 --> 03:30:12.855]  It's because we're... There are happy families in other countries and they, listen,
[03:30:13.456 --> 03:30:19.021]  They tell Candy and I, when we get them to open up, they're like, well, you know, you Americans are kind of crazy.
[03:30:19.061 --> 03:30:19.922]  All y'all do is fight.
[03:30:20.142 --> 03:30:21.123]  You just, you fight each other.
[03:30:21.143 --> 03:30:22.684]  Y'all fought each other in the Civil War.
[03:30:23.045 --> 03:30:23.925]  You fight everything.
[03:30:23.985 --> 03:30:25.787]  Anything that you want, you take.
[03:30:26.187 --> 03:30:28.289]  You know, Canadians are afraid we're going to take their water.
[03:30:28.329 --> 03:30:29.750]  And they know we want it.
[03:30:29.810 --> 03:30:31.132]  They believe we're going to come take it.
[03:30:31.192 --> 03:30:36.356]  But it's sad that the American families are not as happy as they should be.
[03:30:36.456 --> 03:30:39.119]  Well, let's admit it, from its founding or before, this has been a war zone.
[03:30:39.739 --> 03:30:40.419]  I mean, that's what it is.
[03:30:40.480 --> 03:30:42.000]  And we're supposed to be a Christian nation.
[03:30:42.020 --> 03:30:44.362]  And when the war against the Indians ended, they needed something new.
[03:30:45.182 --> 03:30:48.504]  And then they started going out west and killing the people that had gotten property, the railroads.
[03:30:48.805 --> 03:30:49.705]  The media never talks about it.
[03:30:49.725 --> 03:30:51.226]  The railroads didn't just wipe out Indians.
[03:30:51.666 --> 03:30:54.108]  They would go in and wipe out settlers if they wanted their land.
[03:30:54.348 --> 03:30:55.689]  Yeah, we take everything.
[03:30:55.749 --> 03:30:57.010]  That's the American way.
[03:30:57.090 --> 03:30:59.571]  You know, they taught me as a kid, fighting was an honor.
[03:31:00.191 --> 03:31:02.793]  You know, it was marijuana and candy that taught me peace.
[03:31:03.493 --> 03:31:05.415]  That said, you know, that's good to fight like that.
[03:31:06.155 --> 03:31:07.357]  But there's another side.
[03:31:08.318 --> 03:31:11.561]  You know, had I been taught that when I was younger, it would have saved a lot.
[03:31:11.581 --> 03:31:26.739]  So that's another one of our plights and another one of our missions with this radio show is to give parents the peace that they need and the confidence to raise their families aside from the playbook, don't drink, don't cuss, don't smoke, don't have sex.
[03:31:29.013 --> 03:31:30.013]  Yep, absolutely.
[03:31:30.053 --> 03:31:32.834]  I tell you, I am tired after four hours and forty minutes.
[03:31:32.894 --> 03:31:34.294]  I'm kind of running out of gas here.
[03:31:34.554 --> 03:31:36.995]  I will recharge in about five minutes once the show ends.
[03:31:37.535 --> 03:31:38.935]  Folks, this film needs to be seen.
[03:31:38.995 --> 03:31:40.615]  We need the funds to operate as well.
[03:31:40.895 --> 03:31:42.096]  And this supports Barry Cooper.
[03:31:42.136 --> 03:31:46.296]  Never Get Busted, Volume 1 and 2, available at InfoWars.com.
[03:31:46.636 --> 03:31:51.457]  And then we're going to take you out with the... We're not going to take you out with the Colbert Report?
[03:31:52.958 --> 03:31:54.458]  I mean, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:31:55.578 --> 03:31:56.380]  Oh, we've got it, yeah.
[03:31:56.961 --> 03:31:57.402]  It's right here.
[03:31:57.643 --> 03:31:58.785]  In fact, cut to that right now.
[03:32:00.750 --> 03:32:11.695]  We're going to be showing folks this right over here and we're going to end the show with the guy who openly talks about eugenics and world enslavement, destroying America.
[03:32:11.755 --> 03:32:15.677]  He writes papers about this and cynically admits global warming is not real.
[03:32:15.697 --> 03:32:19.479]  They're going to use it to tax and regulate everybody and fool the liberals into serving them.
[03:32:19.799 --> 03:32:25.882]  Then they're using the phony war on terror to get the right wing to support a police state and he supports the drug war and everything else.
[03:32:26.282 --> 03:32:27.863]  And they said this group didn't exist.
[03:32:28.323 --> 03:32:29.865]  And called me a kook over and over again.
[03:32:30.265 --> 03:32:34.329]  Now they're making it a joke again, having the director of it on the Colbert Report.
[03:32:34.630 --> 03:32:35.891]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[03:32:35.911 --> 03:32:36.632]  So we're going to end with that.
[03:32:36.832 --> 03:32:37.713]  Hey, Barry, great having you in.
[03:32:37.733 --> 03:32:38.694]  Hey, you, of course.
[03:32:38.854 --> 03:32:41.036]  Hope I didn't keep you late from something keeping you over 40 minutes.
[03:32:41.056 --> 03:32:41.396]  No, no, that's okay.
[03:32:41.416 --> 03:32:41.897]  That's alright.
[03:32:41.937 --> 03:32:43.739]  We just have a campaign meeting and then we're done.
[03:32:43.919 --> 03:32:51.708]  All right, and by the way, folks, we are coming up in about ten minutes in the rebroadcast at Infowars.com, the restream's there.
[03:32:52.950 --> 03:32:59.618]  I go through a two-hour analysis of Barack Obama's speech and go through each comment he made and show how it's deceptive.
[03:32:59.938 --> 03:33:00.639]  God bless you all.
[03:33:01.380 --> 03:33:02.141]  Never get busted again.
[03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:11.577]  My guest tonight thinks the next administration faces great challenges abroad.
[03:33:11.957 --> 03:33:14.100]  Nothing compared to the challenges it'll face from me.
[03:33:14.600 --> 03:33:16.262]  Please welcome Richard Haass!
[03:33:16.302 --> 03:33:19.566]  Mr. Haass, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:33:24.338 --> 03:33:27.582]  Now, you are the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, alright?
[03:33:28.263 --> 03:33:33.010]  You guys toy with countries of the world like, well, like toys.
[03:33:33.430 --> 03:33:33.811]  Don't you?
[03:33:34.251 --> 03:33:35.373]  You're like the Illuminati.
[03:33:35.393 --> 03:33:36.074]  You're the Masons.
[03:33:36.114 --> 03:33:37.355]  You control everything, don't you?
[03:33:37.776 --> 03:33:38.958]  That's the rap on you guys.
[03:33:39.636 --> 03:33:41.837]  What's so interesting now, though, is who's on the chessboard.
[03:33:41.857 --> 03:33:43.979]  It's the toys, if you will, a lot more than states.
[03:33:44.219 --> 03:33:45.780]  It's all sorts of non-state actors.
[03:33:45.880 --> 03:33:46.601]  It's good guys.
[03:33:46.961 --> 03:33:47.781]  It's also bad guys.
[03:33:47.841 --> 03:33:48.202]  What do you mean?
[03:33:48.222 --> 03:33:53.705]  The Council on Foreign Relations, like the people, the big countries in the world, are not necessarily the only people you deal with?
[03:33:53.785 --> 03:33:55.066]  Who do you deal with that aren't countries?
[03:33:55.627 --> 03:33:56.287]  Well, think about it.
[03:33:56.307 --> 03:33:56.947]  You've got everything.
[03:33:57.188 --> 03:33:58.909]  Who makes a difference in foreign policy right now?
[03:33:58.949 --> 03:34:00.250]  You've got everything from big banks.
[03:34:00.270 --> 03:34:01.510]  You've got everything from foundations.
[03:34:01.530 --> 03:34:02.511]  You've got universities.
[03:34:02.531 --> 03:34:03.732]  You've got terrorist groups.
[03:34:04.613 --> 03:34:05.193]  CNN.
[03:34:05.893 --> 03:34:06.454]  Increasingly...
[03:34:08.064 --> 03:34:08.824]  My apologies.
[03:34:12.185 --> 03:34:16.426]  You're telling me Wolf Blitzer's on that board and I'm not, I'm going to be pretty upset.
[03:34:17.826 --> 03:34:18.346]  Duly noted.
[03:34:18.386 --> 03:34:24.368]  Here's my question, as the President of the Council on Foreign Relations, the United States does not have foreign relations anymore.
[03:34:24.428 --> 03:34:25.628]  Why do you still have a job?
[03:34:27.049 --> 03:34:28.469]  We cut those countries free.
[03:34:29.649 --> 03:34:31.610]  What's so interesting now is you really don't have a choice.
[03:34:32.110 --> 03:34:33.810]  Things that happen there come here.
[03:34:33.890 --> 03:34:36.211]  We can't turn this country into a gated community.
[03:34:36.231 --> 03:34:37.311]  We're going to build a wall, sir.
[03:34:38.729 --> 03:34:44.432]  We're going to build a wall, the southern border, the northern border, out the ocean, and we're going to put a dome over the entire thing.
[03:34:44.872 --> 03:34:46.833]  Poke a few holes so we can breathe, like a caterpillar.
[03:34:47.493 --> 03:34:53.976]  What's so interesting is that even if you were to build a wall, people find their way through, greenhouse gases find their way through, drugs find their way through.
[03:34:54.557 --> 03:34:57.298]  To use the metaphor, the world is not Las Vegas.
[03:34:57.418 --> 03:34:59.739]  What happens there won't stay there, it will come here.
[03:34:59.779 --> 03:35:03.721]  And one of the reasons... The world is not as fun as Las Vegas.
[03:35:03.781 --> 03:35:06.742]  I've been to the world, it doesn't really... You're exactly right.
[03:35:06.762 --> 03:35:08.003]  It doesn't really hold up under scrutiny.
[03:35:09.523 --> 03:35:13.646]  Exactly right, and a lot of the things that come our way, a lot of globalization isn't fun.
[03:35:14.066 --> 03:35:17.089]  And you've got everything from terrorists, and so we've got to be real about it.
[03:35:17.129 --> 03:35:19.070]  What is wrong with the world?
[03:35:22.012 --> 03:35:24.294]  Because we've got a lot of problems with the world right now.
[03:35:24.394 --> 03:35:26.896]  Where did the whole rest of the world go wrong?
[03:35:27.257 --> 03:35:28.698]  Because America is right.
[03:35:30.039 --> 03:35:30.719]  What's your view of that?
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:33.341]  Are you one of the duly noted?
[03:35:35.083 --> 03:35:36.604]  Do we know it or do you agree with me?
[03:35:36.624 --> 03:35:38.844]  Because you're not one of those blame America firsters, are you?
[03:35:39.124 --> 03:35:40.945]  You blame America for America's problems?
[03:35:41.545 --> 03:35:44.826]  What's so interesting about... Do you blame America for America's problems?
[03:35:45.687 --> 03:35:51.789]  Some of them we should... Some of them... One of the biggest threats to ourselves... One of the biggest threats to ourselves is ourselves.
[03:35:52.069 --> 03:35:52.549]  Like POGO.
[03:35:52.569 --> 03:35:53.289]  We've got to be careful.
[03:35:53.689 --> 03:36:01.412]  Unless we deal with our, say, entitlement problem, Medicare, Social Security, unless we deal with our economic problem, we are not going to have the foundations to be a strong international government.
[03:36:01.432 --> 03:36:03.873]  So if we're a danger to ourselves, should we be isolated and medicated?
[03:36:05.472 --> 03:36:09.153]  Should America's shoelaces be taken away from it so it doesn't hang itself in its cell?
[03:36:09.773 --> 03:36:12.094]  What do you mean we're one of our own worst problems?
[03:36:12.434 --> 03:36:14.035]  We're also an amazing force for good in the world.
[03:36:14.095 --> 03:36:14.855]  That's what I like.
[03:36:15.015 --> 03:36:30.761]  If you look at this 21st century, compared to the previous century when you had two world wars and a cold war, this century is starting out in ways where the potential for us to be cooperating with others to actually make the world a safer, freer, more prosperous place, that possibility's there.
[03:36:30.941 --> 03:36:31.801]  What about China, though?
[03:36:31.961 --> 03:36:33.001]  How scared should I be?
[03:36:33.042 --> 03:36:34.122]  Have you heard about this kiss they got?
[03:36:35.652 --> 03:36:36.860]  Should I be scared of China?
[03:36:36.880 --> 03:36:37.866]  Are they a threat to us?
[03:36:38.882 --> 03:36:40.303]  There's 1.4 billion people.
[03:36:40.923 --> 03:36:45.445]  They're holding 2 trillion dollars in reserves.
[03:36:45.485 --> 03:36:47.106]  Why can't we do something about that Chinese debt?
[03:36:47.126 --> 03:36:49.787]  Why don't we just borrow that money and pay China off?
[03:36:50.027 --> 03:36:54.370]  Well, they were more willing to give some of it to us when they were confident their investments were going to work.
[03:36:54.850 --> 03:36:58.552]  But at the end of the day, both they and we have a stake in an international economy working.
[03:36:58.572 --> 03:37:00.492]  They need to keep their people employed.
[03:37:00.793 --> 03:37:05.715]  Their political system can't weather millions of people being unemployed.
[03:37:05.755 --> 03:37:06.816]  So they need to sell to us.
[03:37:06.856 --> 03:37:07.696]  So interestingly enough,
[03:37:08.200 --> 03:37:11.203]  The United States and China actually have a stake in cooperating.
[03:37:11.223 --> 03:37:19.731]  So they lend us money, like they give me five bucks and then I give it back to them for some useless piece of plastic that I give to my child for Christmas.
[03:37:20.231 --> 03:37:22.733]  And then that's a mutually beneficial relationship.
[03:37:23.834 --> 03:37:24.555]  It's called trade.
[03:37:25.176 --> 03:37:28.639]  And what's so interesting about it...
[03:37:31.145 --> 03:37:33.667]  It gives us each a stake in international order.
[03:37:34.248 --> 03:37:42.855]  The goal for the 21st century ought to be that countries like the United States and China, which in the past might have gone to war, were the great power of the day, they're the rising power.
[03:37:43.255 --> 03:37:47.859]  The goal ought to be to find ways where we each give one another a stake in getting along.
[03:37:47.879 --> 03:37:51.182]  We don't want the 21st century to go the way of the 20th century.
[03:37:51.282 --> 03:37:52.023]  It's too dangerous.
[03:37:52.043 --> 03:37:53.224]  We've got to do things... I agree.
[03:37:53.244 --> 03:37:54.345]  We can't repeat that.
[03:37:54.365 --> 03:37:58.208]  We can't repeat that other than the part where we kick ass and stay on time.
[03:37:59.912 --> 03:38:04.513]  Richard Haass, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:38:04.533 --> 03:38:15.917]  Richard Haass from the Council on Foreign Relations.
