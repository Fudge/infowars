[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:02.130]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.492]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:12.695]  Big Brother.
[00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:14.396]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:16.217]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:17.678]  You want answers?
[00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:20.359]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:23.661]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:28.263]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:35.496]  It is Wednesday, the fourth day.
[00:00:36.818 --> 00:00:39.779]  of March 2009 for the next 30 minutes.
[00:00:39.799 --> 00:01:02.567]  I'm going to break down the reality of the military-industrial complex takeover, the FEMA camps, the open announcement of world government being set up by the banks that you'll pay carbon taxes to, and how people like Glenn Beck are countering this, after denying it all these years, and how they're attempting to co-opt the Patriot Liberty Movement, and how every time he talks about FEMA camps, he then talks about the threat of Russia and Iran.
[00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:05.668]  He creates the fear of FEMA camps, then psychologically flips it
[00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:06.828]  I think so.
[00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.562]  And the reason I'm getting into this is because this is a psy-op by Fox News.
[00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:32.003]  This is Fox News, the big purveyors of propaganda.
[00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:34.104]  They're there to neutralize conservatives.
[00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:37.887]  You know, Limbaugh's been discredited for decades saying no New World Order existed.
[00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:39.908]  Now it's all over the news as the savior.
[00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:42.090]  It's exactly as we said the New World Order would be.
[00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.714]  A World Bank, Bank of the World, Time Magazine, Newsweek, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times of London, all saying it's good.
[00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:52.477]  North American Union's good and the Wall Street Journal now owned by News Corp and Fox News.
[00:01:54.217 --> 00:01:56.518]  Okay, we're in a depression, the answer is world government.
[00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:03.582]  And then they have him over there playing the part of, well, I don't know if this is a good idea, but I'm worried about the bubble factor in their guns.
[00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:04.142]  What do we do?
[00:02:05.353 --> 00:02:21.501]  That's the same way that Tommy Franks, four years ago, would go on Fox and say, and other channels, and say, you know, I'm real sad about this, but it's what the people are going to demand for security, that the next time we're hit by terrorists, we're going to have to have martial law and a military form of government in America.
[00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:24.843]  Gee, I'm sorry that's going to happen, but that's all that'll keep us safe.
[00:02:25.483 --> 00:02:28.084]  You don't expect to come out and say martial law's good, military occupation's good.
[00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:32.567]  He says, gee, I'm sorry, it's not really our form of government, but it's all that'll keep you safe.
[00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:35.092]  You know, martial law is what will keep you safe.
[00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:35.955]  It's what the people want.
[00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:38.684]  When it's not what the people want, martial law won't keep you safe.
[00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:54.005]  That's how they proposed it, and I said on air, we knew the Pentagon was spending tens of billions to buy reporters, to have fake news, not just Armstrong Williams to push No Child Left Behind, $240,000 a year to go out secretly, and secretly being funded to push that.
[00:02:54.285 --> 00:03:08.835]  It was thousands of reporters, and I said, I guarantee you, Frank's is all over TV, he's getting money from the Pentagon slush fund to go say this, and then it came out in mainstream news that he was paid over $500,000 that year alone to go out and read that talking point
[00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:14.580]  On the news, introducing that martial law keeps you safe, we've got to get rid of our form of government.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:25.809]  Now the White House memos, I'm going through the evidence now, the John Yoo memos have been released and it says we're going to ban free speech, we're going to basically make Bush a dictator, this is mainstream headlines.
[00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.893]  He went on to say, here's the headline, terror memos reveal total destruction of U.S.
[00:03:30.913 --> 00:03:31.814]  constitutional freedoms.
[00:03:32.675 --> 00:03:36.138]  He goes on to say that under PDD 51, just the cover sheet,
[00:03:37.058 --> 00:03:42.262]  It states that the President is a dictator under any emergency, including economic, that the Congress can't review it.
[00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:49.727]  When Congress and the highest level committee on security, Homeland Security, asked to see the full document, they were told no national security.
[00:03:50.467 --> 00:04:03.736]  Now we have the John U. memos, where they say the President is above all branches of government, when supposedly legislative, executive, judicial, or co-equal founders said that really the legislative was above the courts and the executive, the President.
[00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:07.124]  So all of that is going on, all of that is admitted.
[00:04:07.224 --> 00:04:09.406]  I've got scores of video clips here.
[00:04:10.587 --> 00:04:16.533]  One of them is titled, 26,000 Pastors for Martial Law, Continuity of Government.
[00:04:16.973 --> 00:04:23.158]  And then it goes in Representative Peter Defazio on the Homeland Security Committee talking about how they were told they're not allowed to read it.
[00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:26.882]  They're co-equal with the President, but they can't see it.
[00:04:28.772 --> 00:04:31.314]  And then we have other newscasts.
[00:04:31.514 --> 00:04:36.018]  Years after we told you about the Clergy Response Team, how they had secretly hired 26,000 preachers.
[00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:44.425]  We got the secret FEMA documents to tell their flock to take implantable injections, go to FEMA camps, have their families broken up.
[00:04:45.045 --> 00:04:45.966]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:04:46.126 --> 00:04:47.307]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:04:47.768 --> 00:04:53.973]  InfraGard, now 50,000 executives who shoot to kill orders, who have been secretly FBI deputized.
[00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:55.053]  We're going to go over all of that.
[00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:57.196]  And a lot more coming up.
[00:04:57.216 --> 00:04:59.537]  You know, Glenn Beck says he doesn't know if the camps are real.
[00:05:00.037 --> 00:05:03.820]  We'd have to be hiding, you know, under his bed not to know that.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.662]  So we'll come back and go over all this.
[00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:08.843]  Attention.
[00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:11.865]  This is an extremely urgent, self-reliant news bulletin.
[00:05:12.225 --> 00:05:18.669]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.930]  Here is why.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:30.745]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:33.606]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:05:33.946 --> 00:05:36.027]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:05:36.067 --> 00:05:36.587]  this fall?
[00:05:37.047 --> 00:05:37.568]  Don't wait.

[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.900]  Act now!
[00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:14.162]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:16.503]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:06:17.183 --> 00:06:18.203]  But who is the enemy?
[00:06:18.723 --> 00:06:19.244]  Bin Laden.
[00:06:19.524 --> 00:06:20.384]  This is his M.O.
[00:06:20.424 --> 00:06:21.845]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:06:21.885 --> 00:06:23.565]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:30.648]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:06:31.028 --> 00:06:31.469]  Some U.S.
[00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:37.151]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:41.374]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:06:41.394 --> 00:06:43.516]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:07:07.717 --> 00:07:10.659]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:16.043]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:16.343 --> 00:07:21.687]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:22.047 --> 00:07:23.168]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:23.528 --> 00:07:32.434]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:07:32.834 --> 00:07:34.476]  Now compare a Kalben Pure Soap.
[00:07:34.676 --> 00:07:38.861]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:08:08.568 --> 00:08:14.112]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.478 --> 00:08:19.399]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:24.220]  I'm going to go over the evidence of FEMA camps and tell you exactly how they operate here right now.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.442]  Then I'm going to get into how the media, the corporate media, now that this can't be denied anymore, is trying to spin it.
[00:08:31.183 --> 00:08:38.525]  First off, Exhibit A. Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:08:39.932 --> 00:08:42.853]  This is directly from the Army's own website.
[00:08:43.353 --> 00:08:44.133]  It's the top link.
[00:08:44.153 --> 00:08:51.376]  If you Google, Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, you will be on the Army's own website.
[00:08:51.536 --> 00:08:53.837]  In 2002, I published my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:08:53.857 --> 00:08:59.599]  I've been covering it since 97, when it was declassified, but I put it in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:09:00.579 --> 00:09:08.722]  The only other media outlet that I have seen that ever covered this was Dr. Jerome Corsi,
[00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.711]  Civilian prisons coming soon to the U.S.
[00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:12.732]  Army base near you.
[00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:17.175]  Little notice regulation allows construction of military installations to hold civilian U.S.
[00:09:17.215 --> 00:09:17.955]  citizens on them.
[00:09:18.336 --> 00:09:21.358]  Well, they've been in the camps since 86.
[00:09:21.878 --> 00:09:23.479]  It was not declassified until 1997.
[00:09:27.346 --> 00:09:33.167]  The regulation revises an earlier civilian inmate labor camp signed December 9, 1997 under the Clinton administration.
[00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:34.248]  That's when they declassified it.
[00:09:34.888 --> 00:09:38.949]  So, here is WorldNet Daily on that front.
[00:09:39.469 --> 00:09:42.950]  So, it is Army Regulation 210-35.
[00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:43.850]  Army Regulation 210-35.
[00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:44.110]  Now, in
[00:09:53.717 --> 00:10:01.523]  1986, under Rex 84, they opened 12 secret army camps to test if they could keep them secret while they held federal.
[00:10:01.563 --> 00:10:02.964]  Now they hold state prisoners as well.
[00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:10.369]  Federal prisoners would then be given a few years off their sentence if they agreed to not tell family about it and to go to the labor camps.
[00:10:10.469 --> 00:10:15.273]  It is a labor camp and under the revised military rules it allows any U.S.
[00:10:15.293 --> 00:10:17.614]  citizens to be put in it under forced labor.
[00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:20.937]  Now, this is only about
[00:10:24.258 --> 00:10:25.719]  It's exactly thirty pages long.
[00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:32.541]  I suggest you Google, even if you're listening on AM and FM shortwave satellite right now, just write notes.
[00:10:33.081 --> 00:10:36.103]  Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, even if you don't have a computer, go to the library.
[00:10:36.383 --> 00:10:36.983]  This is important.
[00:10:37.463 --> 00:10:38.003]  Write notes.
[00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:41.805]  Go check all of this out for yourself, okay?
[00:10:44.146 --> 00:10:52.049]  Now, that dovetails with the Houston Chronicle and other publications that reported first in
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:11:01.583]  January 7th in the Houston Chronicle, 2006, that emergency FEMA camps were being built by a division of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown, and Root.
[00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:03.343]  Write that note, Google it.
[00:11:03.603 --> 00:11:08.225]  Because, you know, Beck says he's been doing months of research and they've been having trouble finding him.
[00:11:08.245 --> 00:11:16.107]  He's doing research, but he can't ever bring any facts, and he makes little jokes about, ooh, the government's going to get me, or, oh, I'm being censored on Fox and calls us conspiracy theorists.
[00:11:16.347 --> 00:11:20.729]  Okay, well here it is, Beck, and I know listeners for years have been sending you all this, so don't act like you don't know.
[00:11:22.392 --> 00:11:24.253]  Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:28.074]  Now that dovetails with the new legislation introduced.
[00:11:28.695 --> 00:11:33.177]  The camps are already built, kind of like they already had the warrantless wiretapping for years.
[00:11:33.457 --> 00:11:35.978]  And when they got caught, they retroactively went and legalized it.
[00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:48.980]  The bill at these threat fusion centers, FEMA emergency centers in every county and city in the country, they're moving the National Guard in, paying for free space for the police, fire department, emergency management, under federal control.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.144]  It says they're going to have the clergy response teams and community there to help the public as they go into the camp.
[00:11:54.224 --> 00:11:56.245]  Obama's going to build medical centers on these.
[00:11:56.505 --> 00:11:58.446]  They're going to advertise, it's fun to go to the camp.
[00:11:58.466 --> 00:12:02.249]  Like Germany, they didn't say we're taking you to a slave camp, a forced labor camp, and then a death camp.
[00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:06.652]  It was, oh, it's a place because you lost your homes, and you know, it's a refugee
[00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:08.655]  We're good.
[00:12:21.846 --> 00:12:23.687]  National Emergency Centers Act, H.R.
[00:12:24.427 --> 00:12:23.687]  645.
[00:12:24.727 --> 00:12:26.968]  New legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the U.S.
[00:12:27.048 --> 00:12:27.328]  Okay?
[00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:28.589]  There's the bill number.
[00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:29.489]  Gave it to you.
[00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:30.250]  In fact, we have this.
[00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.231]  Can we throw that up on screen for folks?
[00:12:32.811 --> 00:12:33.971]  And I'll give you over a hundred articles.
[00:12:34.092 --> 00:12:36.833]  But, uh, new legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the U.S.
[00:12:36.853 --> 00:12:37.133]  There you go.
[00:12:37.433 --> 00:12:38.393]  That integrates with this.
[00:12:38.433 --> 00:12:40.975]  Now, they doubled these from twelve camps that are listed.
[00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:42.715]  You can go to them with people on them.
[00:12:43.936 --> 00:12:45.677]  People on YouTube have gone and shot to the wire.
[00:12:45.697 --> 00:12:46.617]  It shows prisoners at them.
[00:12:46.637 --> 00:12:48.938]  And we've shot video of children being held in them.
[00:12:49.138 --> 00:12:50.179]  It's in, uh, in-game.
[00:12:51.024 --> 00:13:00.650]  You can go, uh, these are the 24 big ones, first 12, kept secret for 11 years, from 86 to 97, was declassified in 97, and now it's been radically expanded in 2005.
[00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:01.490]  Okay?
[00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:03.171]  There you have it right there.
[00:13:03.752 --> 00:13:05.853]  Absolute, total, complete proof.
[00:13:06.193 --> 00:13:07.714]  People working in them right now.
[00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:13.778]  Then we had the governor four years ago in Rhode Island, it was in the local news,
[00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:24.327]  In the Providence Journal and the local NBC affiliate, they said if you criticize the government, download music, this was in the bill, hundreds of other things, life in prison as under treason.
[00:13:24.347 --> 00:13:36.097]  There was another bill almost passed in Oregon under Senator Menace, you can Google that, Senator Menace, FEMA camp bill, and they said downloading music, protesting, life in prison in a forest labor camp.
[00:13:41.038 --> 00:13:43.680]  I mean, this is just off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.644]  And when the Governor and others got confronted with this in Rhode Island, they said, well, the Feds told us to pass this.
[00:13:49.724 --> 00:13:54.527]  So, I just gave you the sources on that for everybody else that's out there.
[00:13:54.987 --> 00:13:59.730]  We told you Obama was going to set up a million-person domestic spy force, because he announced they would.
[00:13:59.991 --> 00:14:01.772]  The Pentagon had written this up decades ago.
[00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:06.235]  Clinton had pushed it, Bush had pushed it, under divisions of AmeriCorps called Secure Corps.
[00:14:07.115 --> 00:14:16.520]  There were Philadelphia Daily News articles about how they were training 15-year-olds with M-16s in the public schools for warrant apprehension during martial law.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.261]  That's one source on that.
[00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:21.963]  Defense Department announces civilian expeditionary workforce.
[00:14:22.783 --> 00:14:28.286]  This is a Steve Watson, Infowars.net story, but it's all linked to the bills and mainstream news.
[00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:30.947]  Defense Department Directive 1404.10.
[00:14:31.688 --> 00:14:32.548]  Again, write this down.
[00:14:32.588 --> 00:14:33.649]  Defense Department Directive 1404.10.
[00:14:37.825 --> 00:14:55.156]  And this is to establish a giant civilian military, as big as the military, a million person, and it says that you will be deployed under draft, it says that it's compulsory, domestically and internationally overseas, so dual use.
[00:14:55.176 --> 00:15:01.880]  Defense Department announces civilian expeditionary workforce, and then we have links throughout the article to the Department of Defense announcements.
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.861]  Outside of Congress, they've just done this.
[00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.511]  Here's the Washington Post.
[00:15:06.971 --> 00:15:09.573]  Pentagon to detail troops to bolster domestic security.
[00:15:10.053 --> 00:15:13.276]  Military expects to have 20,000 uniformed troops on the streets of the United States.
[00:15:13.676 --> 00:15:22.042]  Also in the Army Times, they announced that for PR purposes, they would have military, Army, and Marines running checkpoints for DUIs.
[00:15:22.062 --> 00:15:23.102]  You're not for drunks, are you?
[00:15:23.303 --> 00:15:24.784]  This is how they condition you to accept it.
[00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:31.909]  That they would also have them with the jaws of life, and it showed it on the Army own website, them helping cut people out of cars.
[00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:38.594]  Well, you're not against the military fighting forest fires, cutting people out of cars, doing drug interdiction, doing anti-terror.
[00:15:38.934 --> 00:15:40.737]  See, that's just the cover story.
[00:15:41.017 --> 00:15:45.664]  Now the Army War College admits, it's been all over the news, they're preparing to quote, engage the American people.
[00:15:46.857 --> 00:15:49.699]  And that their new mission under NORTHCOM is suppressing the American people.
[00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:52.161]  They're teaching police that there's new white Al Qaeda.
[00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:54.342]  And that Americans are about to rebel nationwide.
[00:15:54.362 --> 00:15:55.303]  That's mainstream news.
[00:15:55.683 --> 00:15:57.385]  That they're preparing to crush the American people.
[00:15:57.785 --> 00:15:59.186]  Pentagon to detail troops.
[00:15:59.726 --> 00:16:00.587]  Zoom in on this camera.
[00:16:00.607 --> 00:16:01.868]  I'll use this as a close shot.
[00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:04.009]  Some of these articles you don't have on the computer in there.
[00:16:06.371 --> 00:16:10.694]  Pentagon to detail troops to bolster domestic security.
[00:16:12.735 --> 00:16:14.597]  I'll remind you the Gonzales memos and
[00:16:17.358 --> 00:16:24.582]  New memos just got released where they said they were going to ban free speech in the United States, use troops on the streets of America, and set up a dictatorship.
[00:16:24.622 --> 00:16:27.063]  And that's being continued by Obama.
[00:16:28.724 --> 00:16:29.784]  There's the Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:16:29.824 --> 00:16:31.985]  Foundations are in place for martial law in the United States.
[00:16:37.828 --> 00:16:45.172]  British News is announcing that their government is preparing for martial law with the police and military against the British people.
[00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:49.343]  Sarkozy warns of social unrest because they've engineered it.
[00:16:49.643 --> 00:17:00.711]  In the IMF World Bank documents, released in December 2001, made widely public by the BBC in 2002, as Google IMF World Bank documents leaked, it said they institute riots.
[00:17:00.871 --> 00:17:04.833]  First they collapse society, then there's rioting, then that's their excuse to bring in martial law.
[00:17:05.174 --> 00:17:06.695]  Then they basically repossess everything.
[00:17:10.437 --> 00:17:11.398]  And I could just go on
[00:17:12.734 --> 00:17:14.995]  And on, and on, there's another story.
[00:17:15.055 --> 00:17:15.235]  U.S.
[00:17:15.255 --> 00:17:17.095]  troops asked if they would shoot at American citizens.
[00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:19.216]  Those are all public surveys they're being given.
[00:17:19.236 --> 00:17:27.738]  They're doing urban warfare drills for gun confiscation all over the country, and admitting they're going door-to-door, asking if they can search people's homes as part of a drill, and blocking off the streets.
[00:17:28.218 --> 00:17:38.941]  Towns in Arkansas, Oklahoma, all over the country, this has been on CNN, and they say it like it's a good thing when they report it, are locking down the cities, even during the daylight hours, searching everybody's cars, making you go through checkpoints.
[00:17:38.961 --> 00:17:40.081]  You can Google that.
[00:17:40.322 --> 00:17:41.442]  Towns declare martial law.
[00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.668]  And they've been advising that by the Feds.
[00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.251]  All of that is happening.
[00:17:50.474 --> 00:17:52.596]  But let's go back to the root of this.
[00:17:53.177 --> 00:17:59.583]  Let's go back to when they first set up this plan, and they said they would use riots and the collapse of society as the cover for that, and that came out.
[00:17:59.803 --> 00:18:00.484]  That's just the cover.
[00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:09.210]  With Oliver North in testimony before a joint session, a joint committee of Congress, with Congressman Jack Brooks bringing it up and being told to shut up.
[00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:10.771]  Are you ready with that clip, guys?
[00:18:11.671 --> 00:18:13.872]  Okay, here is that clip for folks.
[00:18:15.732 --> 00:18:26.116]  Colonel North, in your work at the NSC, were you not assigned at one time to work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster?
[00:18:26.597 --> 00:18:27.337]  Mr. Chairman,
[00:18:30.865 --> 00:18:41.211]  I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area, so may I request that you not touch upon that, sir?
[00:18:42.712 --> 00:18:59.542]  I was particularly concerned, Mr. Chairman, because I read in Miami Papers and several others that there had been a plan developed by that same agency, a contingency plan,
[00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:16.779]  May I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage.
[00:19:17.539 --> 00:19:21.982]  If we wish to get into this on certain arrangements can be made for an executive session.
[00:19:23.323 --> 00:19:27.045]  And tragically, the only member who got close was Jack Brooks.
[00:19:27.645 --> 00:19:28.986]  And he was stopped by the chairman.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:36.921]  And you can go watch Henry B. Gonzalez saying the government was going to use staged attacks, staged crises to bring in martial law.
[00:19:36.941 --> 00:19:37.742]  It got exposed.
[00:19:38.142 --> 00:19:38.742]  It was stopped.
[00:19:39.602 --> 00:19:43.863]  Every time we stop them from doing this, and they go, oh look, it didn't exist, because we stopped it.
[00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:44.763]  You stopped it.
[00:19:45.203 --> 00:19:49.464]  Now I'm going to come back, and I'm going to get into Glenn Beck saying none of this exists.
[00:19:49.544 --> 00:19:56.126]  And I have clip after clip after clip of Congress now, Congress threatened with martial law if they didn't pass the Banker Takeover Bill.
[00:19:57.268 --> 00:20:00.050]  Now 9.7 trillion stolen according to AP and Bloomberg.
[00:20:00.431 --> 00:20:02.172]  This is a banking hijacking.
[00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:03.913]  We have their own blueprints for it.
[00:20:04.354 --> 00:20:05.655]  Okay, this is the facts.
[00:20:07.316 --> 00:20:15.382]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:20:15.563 --> 00:20:19.946]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:20:20.126 --> 00:20:24.630]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.211]  It's a documented fact.
[00:20:27.052 --> 00:20:33.678]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:20:33.818 --> 00:20:45.670]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.

[00:21:05.158 --> 00:21:08.919]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:21:09.179 --> 00:21:12.619]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:21:12.779 --> 00:21:14.580]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.961]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:19.241]  It is essential that patriots
[00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:19.621]  We're good to go.
[00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:49.536]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.

[00:22:24.577 --> 00:22:36.983]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:22:37.103 --> 00:22:40.184]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:22:40.284 --> 00:22:43.546]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:22:43.626 --> 00:22:46.467]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:22:46.707 --> 00:22:49.448]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.

[00:23:13.796 --> 00:23:16.297]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[00:23:16.657 --> 00:23:21.399]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[00:23:21.719 --> 00:23:23.460]  Signs include itching, pulling,
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.521]  We're good to go!

[00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:18.389]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:19.871]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:24:22.273 --> 00:24:24.094]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:24.194 --> 00:24:24.875]  to 3 p.m.
[00:24:25.495 --> 00:24:30.079]  on the AM and FM dial, simulcast on shortwave satellite and always the web at InfoWars.com.
[00:24:30.099 --> 00:24:37.205]  We have a free podcast downloaded by more than 125,000 people a day for free at InfoWars.com and growing by about a few thousand a week.
[00:24:38.058 --> 00:24:38.400]  Okay.
[00:24:39.585 --> 00:24:39.766]  So...
[00:24:42.669 --> 00:25:10.474]  If Glenn Beck wants to know if the FEMA camps are real or not, all he has to do is go to the Army War College, the army.mil website, the Army Times, and they say, and it's been all over the Phoenix newspapers, the police say they're ready to work with the military against the people, that their new mission is fighting the American people physically, that they're acclimating us by having troops on the streets through PR, at the checkpoints for DUIs, against citizens, violating positive commentators, helping people get out of car wrecks, it's all PR.
[00:25:10.894 --> 00:25:13.155]  And to condition the troops and police that it's okay.
[00:25:13.635 --> 00:25:20.878]  And more evidence, other exhibits, are Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, all free on the web.
[00:25:21.618 --> 00:25:23.339]  Films I made in the late 90s.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:30.482]  And I went to urban warfare drills where the Marines and Army would hire role players who would scream, I'm an American, please no, not the camp.
[00:25:30.802 --> 00:25:32.843]  They would do mock executions of American citizens.
[00:25:33.623 --> 00:25:38.445]  The Marines let us videotape mock interrogations of supposed US citizens.
[00:25:40.322 --> 00:25:41.683]  They would set them down and say, where are you from?
[00:25:41.703 --> 00:25:42.503]  I'm from San Francisco.
[00:25:42.523 --> 00:25:43.224]  Where'd you get the helmet?
[00:25:43.244 --> 00:25:44.024]  Where'd you get the weapons?
[00:25:44.745 --> 00:25:51.829]  So, this is why I've been raising the alarm, because they have been gearing up for this and telling the locals it was for training overseas.
[00:25:52.209 --> 00:25:54.651]  And they do this over and over and over and over again.
[00:25:56.167 --> 00:26:01.412]  And for folks watching the simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv, we're showing video of the Marines.
[00:26:01.432 --> 00:26:03.573]  We're going to show you a mock FEMA camp.
[00:26:03.593 --> 00:26:05.815]  They also had foreign troops there assisting.
[00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:11.740]  We have video of a cooperative nugget in the mid-1990s where foreign troops admittedly were training in the U.S.
[00:26:12.041 --> 00:26:14.022]  to put Americans in camps.
[00:26:14.923 --> 00:26:16.845]  That is the camp right there you see on your screen.
[00:26:19.764 --> 00:26:22.126]  So it's all there for anybody that wants to know the truth.
[00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:34.017]  Now remember, under PDD 51, signed a few years ago by Bush that Obama's expanded and continued, they state that Congress has no authority during emergencies and the President's basically an absolute dictator.
[00:26:34.037 --> 00:26:36.420]  When Congress wanted to see the detailed documents,
[00:26:38.226 --> 00:26:41.829]  They were told you're not allowed to enter national security when Congress is co-equal to the President.
[00:26:41.969 --> 00:26:43.069]  That is dictatorship.
[00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.610]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:47.232]  26,000 pastors for martial law, continuity of government.
[00:26:47.332 --> 00:26:49.234]  Because the first half of the clip is a newscast on that.
[00:26:49.534 --> 00:26:50.415]  We're not going to play that later.
[00:26:50.435 --> 00:26:54.097]  We're going to play right now Representative Peter DeFazio, Democrat, Oregon.
[00:26:54.337 --> 00:26:57.159]  And then later the Chairman himself asked for the documents and was told no.
[00:26:57.499 --> 00:27:00.862]  So the Congress can't be trusted to be part of this with the foreign troops.
[00:27:01.222 --> 00:27:02.543]  They can know all about PDD 51.
[00:27:02.823 --> 00:27:03.143]  Here it is.
[00:27:03.784 --> 00:27:06.626]  Back about this time for what purpose is the gentleman from Oregon, right?
[00:27:13.027 --> 00:27:15.889]  Most Americans would agree that it would be prudent
[00:27:17.054 --> 00:27:25.022]  To have a plan to provide for the continuity of government and the rule of law in case of a devastating terrorist attack or natural disaster.
[00:27:25.042 --> 00:27:31.829]  A plan to provide for the cooperation, the coordination and continued functioning of all three branches of the government.
[00:27:31.869 --> 00:27:35.312]  The Bush administration tells us they have such a plan.
[00:27:35.733 --> 00:27:39.837]  They introduced a little sketchy public version that's clearly inadequate.
[00:27:40.418 --> 00:27:43.748]  Uh, and, and doesn't really tell us what they have in mind.
[00:27:44.069 --> 00:27:47.138]  But they said, don't worry, there's a detailed classified version.
[00:27:47.702 --> 00:28:00.947]  But now they've denied the entire Homeland Security Committee of the United States House of Representatives access to their so-called detailed plan to provide for continuity of government.
[00:28:00.987 --> 00:28:01.988]  They say trust us.
[00:28:02.368 --> 00:28:02.948]  Trust us?
[00:28:03.489 --> 00:28:07.850]  The people who brought us Katrina to be confident in face of a disaster?
[00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:08.891]  Trust us?
[00:28:09.311 --> 00:28:15.193]  The people who brought us warrantless wiretapping and other excesses eroding our civil liberties?
[00:28:15.894 --> 00:28:16.594]  Trust us?
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.484]  Maybe the plan just really doesn't exist and that's why they won't show it to us.
[00:28:22.224 --> 00:28:22.785]  I don't know.
[00:28:23.145 --> 00:28:25.527]  Or maybe there's something there that's outrageous.
[00:28:25.968 --> 00:28:33.575]  The American people need their elected representatives to review this plan for the continuity of government.
[00:28:33.595 --> 00:28:34.796]  Gentlemen, it's time to expire.
[00:28:36.137 --> 00:28:38.840]  Alright, now when we come back, I'm going to play a clip.
[00:28:39.724 --> 00:28:52.388]  And we have Senator Inhofe, we have Congressman Brad Sherman and others that we interviewed here on air or we played clips of on air, both from Congress and here, where they were told martial law will be declared if you don't pass the banker bailout unread on October 3rd, 2008.
[00:28:55.629 --> 00:29:06.202]  And then they bait-and-switched and said it was going to be for the subprime mortgages, and then they said, we're not going to tell you, and it wasn't $700 billion, they just picked a really big number, that's a quote, and it's now $9.7 trillion, five and a half months into this.
[00:29:06.842 --> 00:29:07.343]  Do the math.
[00:29:07.663 --> 00:29:10.367]  October, November, December, January, February.
[00:29:10.427 --> 00:29:10.947]  Five months.
[00:29:11.488 --> 00:29:13.490]  Five months and change into this.
[00:29:16.342 --> 00:29:17.722]  9.7 trillion to offshore banks.
[00:29:18.083 --> 00:29:31.286]  These are a bunch of Bernard Madoff scam artists that created all this fiat currency to buy the world, and now they're saying a New World Bank, Bank of the World, all over the news, will save us and we'll pay carbon taxes to them on every facet of our lives.
[00:29:31.486 --> 00:29:38.888]  So see, now the media's forced, after all these years of saying there's no New World Order, to admit there is, but Glenn Beck says, well, they might be building camps.
[00:29:39.148 --> 00:29:43.269]  And he makes a joke about conspiracy theories and then says, but you know, maybe they're needed.
[00:29:44.144 --> 00:29:44.824]  Maybe they're needed.
[00:29:45.504 --> 00:29:46.505]  So, that's coming up.
[00:29:46.525 --> 00:29:49.905]  This is the supposed champion exposing all of this.
[00:29:51.906 --> 00:29:52.986]  It's just incredible.
[00:29:53.386 --> 00:29:54.166]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:29:54.186 --> 00:29:54.587]  Stay with us.
[00:29:57.967 --> 00:29:58.868]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.368 --> 00:30:00.968]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.908 --> 00:30:04.589]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.964 --> 00:30:09.145]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[00:30:09.326 --> 00:30:11.608]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[00:30:11.748 --> 00:30:17.955]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food if you're a politician who voted for the bailout.
[00:30:22.652 --> 00:30:31.839]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:38.204]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:30:38.445 --> 00:30:41.847]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[00:30:42.047 --> 00:30:46.251]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:47.872]  For the rest of you, go to eFoods.com.
[00:30:53.203 --> 00:30:57.584]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:30:57.604 --> 00:30:58.985]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:31:17.282 --> 00:31:18.123]  Who is the enemy?
[00:31:18.644 --> 00:31:19.144]  Bin Laden.
[00:31:19.464 --> 00:31:20.445]  This is his M.O.
[00:31:20.465 --> 00:31:21.747]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:31:21.807 --> 00:31:23.508]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:30.555]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:31:30.956 --> 00:31:31.396]  Some U.S.
[00:31:31.436 --> 00:31:37.102]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:31:37.782 --> 00:31:41.284]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:31:41.304 --> 00:31:43.426]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:12.095]  Rough roads might be ahead for the economy, but your vehicle doesn't have to experience them.
[00:32:12.376 --> 00:32:14.958]  Can't afford a new vehicle or even an expensive repair?

[00:32:56.996 --> 00:33:00.058]  Alright, let's cut right back into the news, continuing with all the FEMA camp evidence.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:22.601]  We really got concerned in the mid-late 90s when the FBI training manuals went public.
[00:33:22.961 --> 00:33:26.042]  Flyers distributed to every major city department, small city departments.
[00:33:26.282 --> 00:33:35.885]  They put federally paid for anti-terror, anti-extremist police, and even small departments as few as 10 officers to become spying on the American people.
[00:33:36.525 --> 00:33:40.966]  We got video from firefighters and police from FEMA training seminars where they badmouth the Second Amendment.
[00:33:41.226 --> 00:33:44.427]  The Founding Fathers, that's in my film The Road to Tyranny, free on Google and YouTube.
[00:33:45.694 --> 00:33:46.835]  Here's just one of the flyers.
[00:33:46.955 --> 00:33:55.744]  Call a member of the Phoenix FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, Investigator Al Shearer, Maricopa County's office, Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[00:33:56.805 --> 00:34:02.791]  And when you read the back of the flyer, just Google FBI flyer constitutional terrorist.
[00:34:03.391 --> 00:34:06.654]  You can then go read it and call the phone numbers on it and talk to the FBI if you'd like.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.921]  And give me a close shot, I want to show folks the cover of the flyer.
[00:34:10.362 --> 00:34:13.043]  When you read in there it says, Constitutional Terrorist.
[00:34:13.323 --> 00:34:14.644]  People that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:34:14.684 --> 00:34:15.424]  Constitution.
[00:34:15.645 --> 00:34:17.326]  People that say they believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:20.487]  Are terrorists and need to be put in terrorism databases.
[00:34:21.188 --> 00:34:22.769]  Now, people thought this ended with Clinton.
[00:34:22.789 --> 00:34:25.010]  It expanded covertly under Bush.
[00:34:27.884 --> 00:34:31.607]  So there is just one of the many flyers and pieces of material.
[00:34:32.287 --> 00:34:37.991]  On that, continuing, let's go ahead and play Congressman Brad Sherman, who we also interviewed here on the show.
[00:34:38.311 --> 00:34:39.712]  They were threatened with martial law.
[00:34:40.072 --> 00:34:43.755]  He wouldn't stay on the show because of House rules and closed committee.
[00:34:44.055 --> 00:34:44.695]  Who threatened him?
[00:34:44.735 --> 00:34:52.661]  Later, Senator Inhofe went public from Oklahoma and said it was Ben Bernanke, head of the private Federal Reserve and the head of the Treasury, Paulson at the time.
[00:34:52.901 --> 00:34:55.663]  This has all just expanded under Obama, hasn't gone away.
[00:34:55.923 --> 00:34:57.604]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:34:58.144 --> 00:35:05.230]  From Ohio, the only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:08.152]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[00:35:09.128 --> 00:35:28.935]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[00:35:30.171 --> 00:35:31.832]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[00:35:32.613 --> 00:35:33.473]  Unjustified.
[00:35:33.954 --> 00:35:34.674]  Proven wrong.
[00:35:35.335 --> 00:35:38.497]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks to write a good bill.
[00:35:39.077 --> 00:35:43.220]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.061]  Alright, now what has the Senate done?
[00:35:45.822 --> 00:35:48.444]  Alright, now, I've gone through about 20 exhibits.
[00:35:48.484 --> 00:35:52.927]  There are over 100 exhibits, and this week or next week, I'm gonna do
[00:35:54.605 --> 00:35:57.728]  Two hours, with no calls, going through the exhibits.
[00:35:57.828 --> 00:36:14.524]  I am going to pull all my research, all the bills, all the legislation, the whole history of the camps, mainstream media clips admitting it, but trying to sell it to the public, and we're going to do a full, you know, half of the show, at least two hours on this subject, uninterrupted, with guests or calls.
[00:36:17.321 --> 00:36:27.425]  I want to challenge folks that after they watch this at PrisonPlanet.tv and it gets ripped to the web everywhere, which we appreciate, if you're watching this in a later part, be sure and watch the first few parts of the video.
[00:36:28.165 --> 00:36:29.466]  I imagine this will be four or five parts.
[00:36:30.206 --> 00:36:45.792]  Because you need to see the background, the proof I went over of the camps all admitted publicly for the American people, gun confiscation, forced inoculation, buying off city leaders, corporate leaders under InfraGard, the clergy response teams, all these terms I'm using Google, you'll have mainstream news, but always telling you how good it is.
[00:36:47.952 --> 00:36:50.433]  So that when I get into Glenn Beck here briefly, you understand.
[00:36:51.853 --> 00:36:56.954]  Because Glenn Beck over and over again on his radio show says basically, arrest 9-11 truthers, send us to secret camps.
[00:36:57.194 --> 00:37:01.055]  It was a talking point on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC.
[00:37:02.136 --> 00:37:05.537]  Use the Army against Ron Paul supporters because they're domestic threats.
[00:37:06.817 --> 00:37:09.699]  John Hannity saying arrest all militia members, every child needs a chip.
[00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:11.560]  I mean, these guys push a lot of sick stuff.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:17.344]  And then suddenly, when it's all announced as a world government, comes out and acts like he's fighting it, but then we'll mix into it.
[00:37:17.364 --> 00:37:19.626]  We've got, you know, Russia's a threat, Iran's a threat.
[00:37:19.966 --> 00:37:21.007]  You know, we've got to do this.
[00:37:21.107 --> 00:37:22.968]  Oh, I'm worried about the Bubba's and their guns.
[00:37:23.428 --> 00:37:24.709]  Maybe we need FEMA camps.
[00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:25.950]  I don't know if FEMA camps exist.
[00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.590]  Maybe they do.
[00:37:27.831 --> 00:37:30.812]  You know, I was going to cover it, but now I'm not, because I'm still researching.
[00:37:31.012 --> 00:37:39.195]  Oh, I guess Fox is censoring me, you know, conspiracy theories, making a joke out of that, when it's on record that all the major media is on government payroll and talking points.
[00:37:40.016 --> 00:37:41.396]  In fact, pull up some of the articles.
[00:37:41.436 --> 00:37:42.837]  I had you guys pull up some of the headlines.
[00:37:42.857 --> 00:37:48.038]  You just Google, Pentagon paying for fake news in the U.S., White House paying for fake news in the U.S.
[00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:50.019]  It's now in the tens of billions every year.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:56.982]  But when it came out, they just used one Armstrong-Williams case and one at the New York Times, where somebody was being paid off to lie about aluminum tubes.
[00:37:58.044 --> 00:37:59.125]  This is what's going on.
[00:38:00.407 --> 00:38:15.483]  So, there's an Infowars.net story, but if you notice, I point you to our articles because when you go to Pentagon Expands Propaganda Reach with foreign news websites, which they then admit are being pushed domestically, and then you can go to USA Today, see a link there, and go to the
[00:38:16.744 --> 00:38:23.511]  Other mainstream news articles, all those, see all those blue hyperlinks, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can go to that story, link to all of those.
[00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:30.878]  I've had Congress people on talking about how it's illegal, the fake news, the fake news reports they produced and put on radio and TV that were made by the government.
[00:38:32.017 --> 00:38:33.298]  All of this is being done.
[00:38:33.418 --> 00:38:34.658]  Fake polls, everything.
[00:38:34.998 --> 00:38:36.639]  So his joke about that is asinine.
[00:38:37.179 --> 00:38:38.059]  Let's go ahead.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.761]  We've done an audio boil-down.
[00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:42.021]  We're going to play a few video clips.
[00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:45.522]  Again, when I do a full report on this, we're going to go into more detail as we analyze this propaganda.
[00:38:45.943 --> 00:38:53.726]  Here's Glenn Beck on several shows, his own, Fox & Friends, and others, and we cut back to him demonizing Ron Paul supporters and equating us with Timothy McVeigh.
[00:38:53.946 --> 00:38:54.986]  This is our champion.
[00:38:55.026 --> 00:38:56.907]  This is our friend that's waking up.
[00:38:58.709 --> 00:39:02.650]  On Fox News, injecting all this Iran's got nuke propaganda in the middle of it.
[00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.970]  Same propaganda we heard under Bush.
[00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:05.310]  Here it is.
[00:39:25.327 --> 00:39:29.872]  If they don't exist, it's irresponsible to not debunk this story.
[00:39:30.153 --> 00:39:34.198]  We have an independent group on this program looking into it, turning over every stone.
[00:39:34.718 --> 00:39:36.560]  I am going to bring you this story.
[00:39:37.101 --> 00:39:39.123]  This program is not beholden.
[00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:43.248]  This is going to drive the conspiracy theorists crazy.
[00:39:43.268 --> 00:39:44.950]  They're making me say this.
[00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:45.451]  Help!
[00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:48.422]  This program is not beholden to anybody.
[00:39:48.542 --> 00:39:49.362]  I'll stop right there.
[00:39:49.862 --> 00:39:55.824]  He says he's going to cover FEMA camps and then he makes a joke about they're making me, you know, not say this help.
[00:39:56.604 --> 00:39:58.484]  So he's discrediting it right there.
[00:39:59.165 --> 00:40:00.105]  Let's continue with the clip.
[00:40:00.605 --> 00:40:02.746]  Ourselves, I answer to me.
[00:40:03.406 --> 00:40:08.647]  I lost sleep last night worrying about this story, thinking about this story and wanted to make sure that I got it right.
[00:40:09.227 --> 00:40:12.048]  The only thing that I answer to is myself.
[00:40:12.408 --> 00:40:14.729]  And I just want to be able to look at myself in the mirror
[00:40:15.464 --> 00:40:16.544]  And also sleep at night.
[00:40:16.564 --> 00:40:38.111]  Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep,
[00:40:38.751 --> 00:40:39.812]  It is our government.
[00:40:40.212 --> 00:40:42.374]  If you trust our government, it's fine.
[00:40:42.814 --> 00:40:48.278]  If you have any kind of fear that we might be headed towards a totalitarian state, look out.
[00:40:48.558 --> 00:40:49.078]  Buckle up.
[00:40:49.178 --> 00:40:52.841]  There's something going on in our country that is, uh, ain't good.
[00:40:53.241 --> 00:40:55.783]  Joining me now is Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:40:58.095 --> 00:41:01.539]  I know we've been in contact with your office and we would appreciate any help that you have.
[00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:03.521]  I want to make sure we're turning over every stone.
[00:41:03.841 --> 00:41:13.932]  There's a lot of crazy stuff that is being said about these things and I appreciate you talking to us and we'll be in touch with you again because I want to make sure that we have everything that you might be concerned with as well.
[00:41:18.104 --> 00:41:21.808]  Ron Paul's supporters are tapping into something that's very real.
[00:41:21.969 --> 00:41:25.432]  The rising tide of disenfranchisement in this country.
[00:41:25.693 --> 00:41:33.882]  If fringe elements take that disenfranchisement and turn it into violence, we endanger the freedoms we're supposedly all fighting for.
[00:41:34.102 --> 00:41:47.826]  They're going after everybody, and here's the thing, at one point with security so high and tensions on edge, don't you think they're gonna get at the very least tased or beaten to a pulp by somebody who goes, these people look threatening, they don't look threatening?
[00:41:47.946 --> 00:41:49.467]  The Ron Paul revolution.
[00:41:49.927 --> 00:41:55.850]  I think it's meant to be a catchy slogan, but I fear some of his fringe supporters are taking the word revolution too literally.
[00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:03.494]  These truthers are exactly the kind of people who want to rock this nation's foundation, tear us apart, and plant seeds of dissatisfaction in all of us.
[00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:04.775]  These guys are dangerous.
[00:42:05.295 --> 00:42:10.057]  I believe these guys are anarchists that are looking to tear us apart.
[00:42:10.178 --> 00:42:14.840]  I mean, this is the kind of group that a Timothy McVeigh would come from.
[00:42:18.263 --> 00:42:20.084]  And folks, it goes on and on.
[00:42:20.124 --> 00:42:30.772]  This is our little friend, that he hates the 9-11 family, that says it's an inside job, that he hates 9-11 truthers, and it was a talking point, you know, where, oh, the 9-11 truthers are going to bomb us.
[00:42:30.812 --> 00:42:32.153]  They work for Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:32.654 --> 00:42:34.515]  On all these news channels, a talking point.
[00:42:34.975 --> 00:42:39.679]  Now, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, every major publication, you name it, they've done it.
[00:42:40.279 --> 00:42:45.223]  Just type New World Order and pick the name of your newspaper, add it at the end, you'll see articles on Google.
[00:42:45.263 --> 00:42:46.364]  I mean, I've done this test.
[00:42:46.544 --> 00:42:46.945]  Everyone.
[00:42:47.505 --> 00:42:47.865]  Everywhere.
[00:42:48.085 --> 00:42:49.547]  But they're saying it's good.
[00:42:50.187 --> 00:43:00.376]  All these years saying it didn't exist, all these years saying that we were liars and crazies, we had all the documents and the video clips, now they admit it's happening but say it's going to save us.
[00:43:03.898 --> 00:43:05.560]  You see, they have to get you to trust them.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.982]  So, if you watch Glenn Beck,
[00:43:09.005 --> 00:43:09.806]  Well, not even closely.
[00:43:09.846 --> 00:43:10.686]  It's completely obvious.
[00:43:10.786 --> 00:43:13.708]  Every night, he'll go, yeah, New World Order, global bankers, oh, it's horrible.
[00:43:14.149 --> 00:43:22.335]  And then he'll build the fear up and then say, flip it, by the way, Putin's wanting to attack us, and so is Iran, and we've got to go after these guys right now.
[00:43:22.395 --> 00:43:25.057]  The terrorists are about to hit us, and I'm worried about the Boba Factor.
[00:43:25.077 --> 00:43:26.178]  I'm worried about these gun owners.
[00:43:27.247 --> 00:43:28.288]  But I'm worried about the government, too.
[00:43:28.328 --> 00:43:28.768]  What do I do?
[00:43:28.788 --> 00:43:30.930]  I mean, if you trust the government, the camps aren't a problem.
[00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:35.413]  But if you don't trust them, and it's meant to create fear, it's a chilling effect to everybody out there that knows what's going on.
[00:43:35.453 --> 00:43:37.515]  Oh my God, they're admitting camps, so we shut up.
[00:43:37.875 --> 00:43:41.818]  And then so the couch potatoes make the psychological decision to go, oh, well, I'm scared of Putin.
[00:43:42.719 --> 00:43:45.982]  There's nothing to do with it, but I'm scared of Putin, so I guess I'm for these camps.
[00:43:46.062 --> 00:43:47.803]  And see, now they're rolling them out in the news.
[00:43:47.843 --> 00:43:55.269]  The camps will be for you when you're starving, during the collapse of society, which is what the IMF and World Bank have done to countless third world countries in their own documents say they want to do it here.
[00:43:56.786 --> 00:44:02.608]  That to fully bankrupt you so they can consolidate everything with the tens of trillions of fiat currency they're holding, and hoarding, of taxpayer money.
[00:44:04.688 --> 00:44:12.951]  And then once the riots start, which they're trying to push, you know, they have Zygmunt Brzezinski on MSNBC, we played that the other day, saying, I'm really worried about these bankers, they're going to cause riots nationwide.
[00:44:13.511 --> 00:44:14.972]  As if he isn't one of the engineers of it.
[00:44:15.572 --> 00:44:18.193]  See, they know they've got revolution on their hands.
[00:44:18.273 --> 00:44:25.675]  They know that we did our job warning the people, and exposing what was happening, and putting all this information out, and people found out it was true.
[00:44:27.222 --> 00:44:28.062]  So, recapping.
[00:44:30.083 --> 00:44:35.865]  The Department of Defense in the Washington Post has announced they are putting regular troops on the streets to engage the American people.
[00:44:35.885 --> 00:44:37.306]  The Army War College admits this.
[00:44:37.606 --> 00:44:40.627]  They secretly have had Americans in camps since 1986.
[00:44:40.707 --> 00:44:41.987]  It was declassified in 1997.
[00:44:42.287 --> 00:44:43.988]  Sounds incredible.
[00:44:44.008 --> 00:44:47.029]  You can read it all right here in the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp program.
[00:44:48.254 --> 00:44:50.495]  Just Google that, you'll be at army.mil.
[00:44:50.715 --> 00:44:55.276]  They've introduced legislation for a million-person domestic security force.
[00:44:55.296 --> 00:45:02.858]  We went over that area of the Army Code that they have now announced and issued.
[00:45:02.938 --> 00:45:06.940]  They have also introduced the National Emergency Centers Act, H.R.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.021]  645, to build these FEMA camps and integrate them with the local police and military.
[00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:14.222]  They are federalizing the National Guard under NORTHCOM completely.
[00:45:16.843 --> 00:45:19.547]  That is the type of news and information we have.
[00:45:19.587 --> 00:45:23.992]  We've played you congressmen telling you that they are not allowed to see the martial law plans, but that they're there.
[00:45:24.173 --> 00:45:25.234]  We have the cover sheet, PDD 51.
[00:45:26.235 --> 00:45:31.162]  We've played you the congressmen saying they've been threatened with martial law if they don't do whatever they're told by the White House.
[00:45:31.222 --> 00:45:34.887]  We've played you the clips and have these congressmen and people here on the show.
[00:45:36.974 --> 00:45:42.896]  We've shown you House hearings about the secret camps and Congressmen being told to shut up, you can't talk about the camps.
[00:45:43.076 --> 00:45:45.057]  We've shown you the FBI terror flyer.
[00:45:46.017 --> 00:45:53.340]  Now, I told you guys just on the fly to Google Kansas City, FEMA in Kansas City, says Founding Fathers terrorist.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.101]  Were you able to find that?
[00:45:56.501 --> 00:45:56.921]  Here it is.
[00:45:56.961 --> 00:45:59.442]  This is from my film, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:46:00.552 --> 00:46:12.601]  I don't know how this from web video, I have the high quality DVDs here, people can get it in a combo pack, a three pack, the three films are in one, but in higher quality, but here it is from YouTube, I want to show you this, you can find it now for free and get it.
[00:46:12.621 --> 00:46:24.631]  9-1-1 the road to tyranny, founding fathers were terrorists, and it goes, I mean I have 18 hours of this, I have them training all over the country, I have them teaching police to arrest anybody with a get us out of the UN sticker, this is what's been going on, here it is.
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.001]  It can't work, because think about the Christians, okay?
[00:46:30.021 --> 00:46:32.182]  Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?
[00:46:32.222 --> 00:46:32.402]  No.
[00:46:32.442 --> 00:46:33.002]  What did they do?
[00:46:33.042 --> 00:46:34.123]  They took your head off!
[00:46:34.823 --> 00:46:37.765]  They beheaded you if you didn't accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.
[00:46:38.185 --> 00:46:39.245]  See, this is reality.
[00:46:40.306 --> 00:46:44.468]  Yeah, they're terrorists, but the bottom line is, to them, they are not.
[00:46:45.208 --> 00:46:46.989]  Now, why is that important to understand?
[00:46:47.029 --> 00:46:51.631]  Because they aren't as committed to their cause and to their way of life as you are yours.
[00:46:53.252 --> 00:46:55.933]  And they see you as being wrong.
[00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:05.613]  When people are passionate about what they believe in, they become a very difficult enemy to beat.
[00:47:05.873 --> 00:47:11.597]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[00:47:11.657 --> 00:47:11.957]  Who?
[00:47:12.117 --> 00:47:13.718]  The Founding Fathers.
[00:47:14.098 --> 00:47:15.579]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[00:47:15.619 --> 00:47:16.439]  Back it up!
[00:47:16.479 --> 00:47:17.740]  Stop it right there!
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.521]  Stop it right there!
[00:47:20.049 --> 00:47:25.011]  And notice what Glenn Beck kept saying, oh these crazies, crazy stuff about FEMA camps, ooh they're going to get me, making jokes.
[00:47:25.311 --> 00:47:25.891]  Look at this guy.
[00:47:26.511 --> 00:47:29.772]  He's talking about the Founding Fathers and people that are committed.
[00:47:29.812 --> 00:47:30.993]  He's talking about constitutional terrorists.
[00:47:31.013 --> 00:47:36.095]  Before that, we have the FBI training manuals and flyers they give police, we just showed you.
[00:47:36.275 --> 00:47:38.795]  The cops are so conditioned, they say, who are the terrorists?
[00:47:39.076 --> 00:47:39.876]  Who are the first terrorists?
[00:47:39.896 --> 00:47:40.636]  The Founding Fathers.
[00:47:40.656 --> 00:47:42.097]  They all know, they all say Founding Fathers.
[00:47:42.317 --> 00:47:43.717]  They've already been taught this many times.
[00:47:47.543 --> 00:47:49.344]  He says that's a very difficult enemy to beat.
[00:47:49.984 --> 00:47:54.906]  No, you are the enemy when you become an enemy of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and let foreign bankers take us over.
[00:47:55.386 --> 00:47:55.907]  Play it again.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.941]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[00:48:10.741 --> 00:48:13.423]  You mean George Washington?
[00:48:13.583 --> 00:48:14.143]  Paul Revere?
[00:48:15.264 --> 00:48:18.786]  These guys right here... Let me ask you something.
[00:48:18.966 --> 00:48:21.827]  Did they try to scare people?
[00:48:22.428 --> 00:48:24.449]  They tried to intimidate the British.
[00:48:24.529 --> 00:48:26.310]  Did they use acts of violence?
[00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:36.075]  Your founding fathers, my founding fathers, were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials because they systematically had British officials assassinated.
[00:48:36.675 --> 00:48:37.396]  Assassinated.
[00:48:39.076 --> 00:49:01.357]  The guys who we call our founding fathers, George Washington, Mr. Honest, who cut down the cherry tree and admitted it, is the same guy who signed death orders, if you will, on members of the British government, the British crown, who they wanted to eliminate because politically they had influence in certain pockets of the United States, at that time the 13 colonies, and they wanted to divide and conquer.
[00:49:01.397 --> 00:49:03.079]  They may get a whole lot of civilians,
[00:49:03.619 --> 00:49:05.401]  And hey, I'm gonna be honest with you, okay?
[00:49:05.702 --> 00:49:11.849]  If they killed 10,000 civilians tomorrow with a biological agent, that's too bad for them.
[00:49:14.412 --> 00:49:17.055]  Yeah, so what if they killed 10,000 civilians?
[00:49:17.075 --> 00:49:18.577]  You know how these patriots are.
[00:49:18.597 --> 00:49:19.879]  They're always killing civilians.
[00:49:19.899 --> 00:49:20.560]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:21.701]  That's from my film.
[00:49:22.101 --> 00:49:22.262]  Now...
[00:49:26.474 --> 00:49:33.744]  See how he talks about how they assassinated, they were bad, they wanted to divide and conquer, the founders wanted to divide and conquer, they were terrorists.
[00:49:33.764 --> 00:49:37.770]  And then you read the manuals, it says those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:40.313]  Constitution are terrorists.
[00:49:41.553 --> 00:49:43.235]  Gun owners are terrorists.
[00:49:43.615 --> 00:49:45.237]  This is why the police are so brainwashed.
[00:49:45.438 --> 00:49:52.606]  And in this film, I then have the police from their own squad cars pulling over a woman at a warrantless checkpoint searching papers in Virginia.
[00:49:53.166 --> 00:49:56.811]  She's a naval veteran, no criminal record, Abbey Newman, married, buying canning supplies in town.
[00:49:57.311 --> 00:49:58.873]  And they want to search her car and she says no.
[00:49:59.374 --> 00:50:00.915]  They pull her out, slam her against the car.
[00:50:01.576 --> 00:50:09.101]  Charge her with assaulting him, she doesn't touch him, and then they dig out a pocket constitution in one of my videos, and they start getting scared going, she's one of them!
[00:50:09.322 --> 00:50:10.382]  She's one of the extremists!
[00:50:10.662 --> 00:50:11.783]  She's one of the terrorists!
[00:50:12.003 --> 00:50:15.046]  I can't believe we actually found one of them!
[00:50:15.686 --> 00:50:19.589]  It's squad car video of them with their microphones outside the car, freaking out!
[00:50:22.771 --> 00:50:26.393]  Freaking, I mean, police now pull you over with a Patriot sticker, they just go ahead and taser you in many cases.
[00:50:26.674 --> 00:50:28.175]  Because they're so scared to death.
[00:50:28.435 --> 00:50:32.377]  No, the real terrorists are the people teaching the police that our founding fathers were bad.
[00:50:32.437 --> 00:50:34.659]  Now, folks, I could go on for hour after hour, and I am.
[00:50:34.699 --> 00:50:37.381]  Sometime this week or next week, I'm gonna do two hours.
[00:50:38.936 --> 00:50:40.297]  Well, we're just going to go through it all.
[00:50:40.977 --> 00:50:43.398]  This is not 10% of the evidence I've got.
[00:50:44.038 --> 00:50:49.401]  Bob Chapman is going to join us for about 10-15 minutes with a quick economic update with the plunging stock market and what's happening then.
[00:50:49.921 --> 00:51:01.886]  For about an hour and a half, we've got Lindsey Williams coming back on with his powerful inside knowledge from former Atlantic Richfield executive about what's happening with this global operation plunging the oil prices to accentuate and accelerate the global depression.
[00:51:02.586 --> 00:51:04.387]  All this documentation is at InfoWars.com.
[00:51:04.427 --> 00:51:05.167]  You've been seeing.
[00:51:05.448 --> 00:51:05.968]  Stay with us.
[00:51:09.153 --> 00:51:12.604]  In these uncertain times, safety and precaution are key.
[00:51:13.125 --> 00:51:14.710]  Don't rely on others for protection.
[00:51:15.154 --> 00:51:18.477]  Protect yourself and your family with products from Pepperspray.com.
[00:51:18.737 --> 00:51:23.841]  Pepperspray.com carries the largest assortment of pepper spray and personal safety devices on the web.
[00:51:24.101 --> 00:51:27.523]  From home safety to nighttime safety we have the products you need.
[00:51:27.844 --> 00:51:38.011]  Order the Discreet Pepper Mace Baton, which relies on a powerful pepper formula that upon direct contact with an attacker's eyes, forces them to slam shut, causing an intense burning sensation.
[00:51:38.412 --> 00:51:41.214]  This refillable unit is designed to be carried as a key ring.
[00:51:41.534 --> 00:51:42.875]  Easily accessible pepper spray
[00:51:42.895 --> 00:51:43.956]  On September 11, 2001, along with
[00:52:10.802 --> 00:52:13.064]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:52:13.325 --> 00:52:14.626]  And we knew what to do.
[00:52:14.646 --> 00:52:16.448]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:52:16.648 --> 00:52:23.075]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:52:23.675 --> 00:52:32.224]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:52:32.577 --> 00:52:39.382]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:52:39.682 --> 00:52:42.724]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:52:42.844 --> 00:52:48.068]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:52:48.629 --> 00:52:51.250]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:52:51.691 --> 00:52:58.916]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[00:53:01.186 --> 00:53:01.648]  We're good to go.
[00:53:07.822 --> 00:53:13.905]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:53:14.005 --> 00:53:20.027]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:53:20.427 --> 00:53:25.709]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:28.230]  Starve or surrender.
[00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:32.432]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:53:32.932 --> 00:53:33.813]  What then?
[00:53:36.534 --> 00:53:39.356]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:43.798]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:53:43.938 --> 00:53:46.779]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[00:53:46.819 --> 00:53:53.863]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[00:53:54.043 --> 00:53:55.824]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:53:55.924 --> 00:54:01.327]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.
[00:54:01.347 --> 00:54:03.988]  See his link at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:54:04.068 --> 00:54:04.868]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:11.413]  Okay, it's only about 15 after next hour.
[00:54:11.433 --> 00:54:14.296]  We're going to have Bob Chapman with us, InternationalForecaster.com.
[00:54:14.316 --> 00:54:16.979]  My websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:17.259 --> 00:54:22.084]  In summation, the establishment knows everybody's waking up at the camps.
[00:54:22.845 --> 00:54:23.826]  Everything is exploding.
[00:54:23.986 --> 00:54:25.388]  Our web numbers alone are doubling.
[00:54:27.711 --> 00:54:28.911]  This is the buzz worldwide.
[00:54:28.951 --> 00:54:33.053]  I'm on British radio and they say I saw a huge yellow truck with Infowars.com driving around today.
[00:54:33.193 --> 00:54:34.113]  Is that you paying for that?
[00:54:34.193 --> 00:54:34.433]  No.
[00:54:35.213 --> 00:54:38.314]  The people worldwide are waking up because we warned them beforehand.
[00:54:38.334 --> 00:54:39.415]  Everything we said came true.
[00:54:39.935 --> 00:54:45.377]  So the establishment comes out and mixes some truth about FEMA camps and things, but then makes jokes about it.
[00:54:45.757 --> 00:54:47.858]  Mixing it in with patriots and gun owners are dangerous.
[00:54:47.898 --> 00:54:48.858]  He's currently doing that.
[00:54:50.117 --> 00:54:51.780]  Some of them get fooled by that.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.122]  I challenge Glenn Beck.
[00:54:53.162 --> 00:54:55.966]  You claim you've been doing research for weeks on this and you can't sleep.
[00:54:56.026 --> 00:54:56.467]  Okay, buddy.
[00:54:56.827 --> 00:54:58.029]  Everybody's going to email you.
[00:54:59.411 --> 00:55:19.745]  Your radio show and Fox News, the last 45 minute piece we've done, your little staffers can watch that and everything there can be googled, pulled up from government documents at army.mil and FBI and everywhere else and then you'll have a clear picture of what's being set up and how they now have to orchestrate an economic collapse to get us to accept this as society breaks down.
[00:55:21.366 --> 00:55:23.368]  And my film, The Obama Deception, covers all of this.
[00:55:24.414 --> 00:55:26.095]  It's now available at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:26.755 --> 00:55:28.076]  And it shatters the left-right paradigm.
[00:55:28.336 --> 00:55:30.057]  President to president, it just continues.
[00:55:30.518 --> 00:55:31.498]  But that's the bottom line.
[00:55:31.838 --> 00:55:32.879]  I want to see all this.
[00:55:33.039 --> 00:55:35.201]  I want to see the civilian inmate labor camp program.
[00:55:35.261 --> 00:55:43.005]  I want to see the fact that the Army's announced they're going to engage the American people, that NORTHCOM already has the country under effective martial law, and that Congress has been threatened with martial law.
[00:55:43.045 --> 00:55:43.886]  That is martial law.
[00:55:44.798 --> 00:55:49.784]  I want to hear that, Bubba, all together, instead of you making jokes and saying, oh, you know, conspiracy theory.
[00:55:50.505 --> 00:55:51.246]  That's what we want to hear.
[00:55:51.446 --> 00:55:53.869]  This is happening because we're winning, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:54.089 --> 00:55:55.470]  They're being forced to cover all this.
[00:55:55.891 --> 00:56:04.341]  Bob Chapman, formerly with Army Intelligence, in the largest financial newsletter on record until he retired, he's come back, and also the largest gold and private silver broker.
[00:56:05.041 --> 00:56:11.183]  Bob Chapman, also of course, a great patriot, helped fund and finance the publishing of None Dare Call a Conspiracy with Gary Allen back in the 70s.
[00:56:11.243 --> 00:56:14.084]  He's been working with Jebba Griffin and others for more than 40 years.
[00:56:14.384 --> 00:56:15.544]  Good to have you here with us.
[00:56:16.165 --> 00:56:31.930]  I want to come back in 15 minutes and cover the latest financial developments, but in a few minutes, sir, I know you've been on hold listening, your take on the fact that they're now admitting world government, push it, but saying it's going to save us, and then vexing, yeah, there's some camps, maybe they're good, maybe they're bad, but then giving no more information.
[00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:32.530]  Bob Chapman.
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.401]  Well, first of all, I think they've been exposed.
[00:56:37.622 --> 00:56:39.843]  You know, these broadcasts are going all over the world.
[00:56:40.823 --> 00:56:44.665]  There are only a handful of people, but they're making a tremendous difference.
[00:56:45.645 --> 00:56:54.529]  We're getting emails from all over the world from people saying, you know, thank you for being on the programs and enlightening us to what's going on.
[00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:57.410]  And we're getting a lot of foreign subscribers as well.
[00:56:58.491 --> 00:57:00.972]  Just recently, we've got about 10 from Russia.
[00:57:01.921 --> 00:57:03.562]  Plus other places throughout the world.
[00:57:03.682 --> 00:57:07.644]  I'm having troops come up to me on the street and say they're awake and call in and letters.
[00:57:07.984 --> 00:57:08.704]  I mean, police?
[00:57:09.044 --> 00:57:09.384]  Go ahead.
[00:57:10.785 --> 00:57:11.865]  Well, that's great.
[00:57:11.985 --> 00:57:19.449]  And that's the reason I mention that, is that's why the conspiracy is exposing itself, because it has to.
[00:57:19.949 --> 00:57:21.950]  It doesn't have any choice at this point.
[00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:24.071]  Too many people know what they're doing now.
[00:57:24.451 --> 00:57:27.192]  And it's going to get greater and greater and greater in the ignorant
[00:57:27.717 --> 00:57:30.358]  And the uneducated are finally going to catch on as well.
[00:57:31.538 --> 00:57:36.439]  So now they're just hiding in plain view going, oh yeah, there's a world government in FEMA camps, but let's have a discussion.
[00:57:36.479 --> 00:57:37.279]  Maybe we need them.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.760]  You're right about that.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:53.023]  And I think that the propaganda that's being spewed out, this mixture of 95% truth and 5% propaganda, isn't going to work.
[00:57:54.844 --> 00:57:56.524]  And you've gone through it fairly well.
[00:57:57.282 --> 00:58:01.486]  In a very short period of time, very thoroughly, especially in regard to Glenn Beck.
[00:58:01.546 --> 00:58:04.188]  And we discussed this a couple of weeks ago.
[00:58:04.988 --> 00:58:12.314]  And they just want you to think that the major media is covering this, when in fact they're really not.
[00:58:12.735 --> 00:58:14.076]  It's really misdirection.
[00:58:16.298 --> 00:58:20.681]  But this, I mean, every historical indication shows this means they're desperate and that they're in trouble.
[00:58:21.702 --> 00:58:22.583]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:58:22.623 --> 00:58:25.145]  And I don't think many people realize this.
[00:58:25.723 --> 00:58:30.947]  I mean, you know, you and some others who are on the air are really drilling this thing.
[00:58:31.488 --> 00:58:39.754]  But I am very, very chagrined, very unhappy that very few newsletter writers have pursued this.
[00:58:41.075 --> 00:58:41.996]  Stay there, Bob.
[00:58:42.036 --> 00:58:42.537]  Gotta break.
[00:58:42.557 --> 00:58:43.457]  70-second break.
[00:58:43.738 --> 00:58:45.659]  Third hour, only seconds away.
[00:58:48.421 --> 00:58:50.203]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:53.195 --> 00:58:55.477]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.439 --> 00:58:58.040]  Hello, friends.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.021]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:59.161 --> 00:59:03.745]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:59:03.885 --> 00:59:06.648]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:06.848 --> 00:59:09.710]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[00:59:09.891 --> 00:59:14.615]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:14.835 --> 00:59:15.755]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:15.955 --> 00:59:18.916]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:19.196 --> 00:59:26.098]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:26.218 --> 00:59:29.319]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:46.623 --> 00:59:48.404]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:00:00.231 --> 01:00:02.152]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:05.513]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.896 --> 01:00:12.557]  Big Brother.
[01:00:13.217 --> 01:00:14.257]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:16.078]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:17.539]  You want answers?
[01:00:18.319 --> 01:00:19.240]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:23.582]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:28.104]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:32.231]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[01:00:32.251 --> 01:00:36.656]  The mainstream media everywhere is admitting world government is here, but saying it will save us.
[01:00:37.256 --> 01:00:40.419]  A few people like Lou Dobbs are saying it's a bad idea.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:44.343]  He's been credibly doing it for a long time, but conservatively, I believe he's good.
[01:00:44.763 --> 01:00:47.006]  But CNN lets him on to have some credibility.
[01:00:47.626 --> 01:00:49.586]  Because people now know this is going on.
[01:00:49.626 --> 01:00:52.187]  The establishment can't ignore it any longer.
[01:00:52.227 --> 01:00:53.567]  So we're into a conditioning period.
[01:00:53.847 --> 01:00:55.188]  And the establishment's getting scared.
[01:00:55.208 --> 01:00:57.768]  That's why Brzezinski and all of them are on TV going, oh, the evil bankers.
[01:00:57.808 --> 01:00:58.528]  Oh, we've got to do something.
[01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:03.969]  They're going to bait and switch that and shut down smaller tax havens for the general public at the retail level.
[01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:06.850]  So they use our anger and put it into their own operations.
[01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:08.770]  It's very, very sophisticated.
[01:01:09.071 --> 01:01:10.791]  Bob Chapman, let's get into what's happening.
[01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:15.031]  Right, and I think if we were to hold at $4,000 we would be very, very fortunate.
[01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:15.771]  We touched $6,700 yesterday.
[01:01:40.279 --> 01:01:50.409]  In that area, and the news that came out today was so dreadful on employment and other things, and the market's up 127 points.
[01:01:50.909 --> 01:01:56.354]  And that means the United States government's in there trying to hold the market up to keep it from going lower.
[01:01:56.855 --> 01:02:04.342]  I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't get a small rally here back to 7200, which would be normal, and to test that 7268
[01:02:06.175 --> 01:02:10.138]  Bottom that was set in 1994 and then again in 2002.
[01:02:10.878 --> 01:02:21.025]  And so over the period of time here, we'll go down into the $6,000 to $6,600 area probably in the next month or so.
[01:02:21.826 --> 01:02:27.329]  And it'll find some sort of a bottom there and then it'll rally again and then go lower.
[01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:35.295]  But perhaps this year, in all probability next year, and the timing on this is so hard,
[01:02:36.036 --> 01:02:36.897]  Uh, we're going to see 4,000.
[01:02:37.557 --> 01:02:45.882]  And, uh, if you want to project, uh, what happened during the last depression, and we are in a depression already.
[01:02:46.302 --> 01:02:47.723]  We started at the beginning of February.
[01:02:47.743 --> 01:02:57.308]  Um, if you want to go back and compare it, uh, to the 1930s, and I believe we're about five times worse off today than we were then.
[01:02:57.328 --> 01:03:02.931]  Uh, I think that we're looking at a duplication of the 89% correction.
[01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:06.171]  That took place in 1933.
[01:03:06.291 --> 01:03:14.458]  And if that's the case, we're going down to somewhere between 1260 and 1450.
[01:03:14.498 --> 01:03:18.041]  And that's a long, long way down.
[01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:20.884]  And we'll eventually get there.
[01:03:21.324 --> 01:03:31.513]  And now the establishment just has to manage the collapse, pose as our saviors, blame a few little made-offs, the other minions, while they carry out the Ponzi scheme that's meant to implode the whole world into their hands.
[01:03:31.533 --> 01:03:32.934]  I don't think they're going to get away with it, Bob.
[01:03:33.869 --> 01:03:34.790]  I don't think so either.
[01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:42.297]  And I think, you know, one of their major problems is going to be right on Wall Street for people who are not directly involved.
[01:03:42.798 --> 01:03:45.901]  People who work there, they have a good idea what's going on.
[01:03:46.361 --> 01:03:56.310]  And I talked to some of them, and they usually live out in Long Island or a little bit upstate or over in New Jersey, and they were all armed and doing the same thing that we're doing.
[01:03:56.771 --> 01:03:57.832]  Because they know what's coming.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.300]  Yeah, that's the issue.
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.061]  We told the truth for decades.
[01:04:01.101 --> 01:04:02.821]  You told it for 40 plus years.
[01:04:03.381 --> 01:04:05.762]  As we read the globalist plans, now it's all coming true.
[01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.763]  We did our work planting the seeds of truth.
[01:04:09.403 --> 01:04:11.483]  Man, this is going to be one hell of a fight though, Bob.
[01:04:12.744 --> 01:04:17.385]  I know it is, and they know if they lose, they're going to totally lose power.
[01:04:17.545 --> 01:04:22.786]  And in some instances, via treason, they're probably going to forfeit their lives and fortunes.
[01:04:24.158 --> 01:04:30.323]  But you know they'll stage nuke attacks, they'll stage fake terror attacks, Rand Corporation says they're getting ready to stage World War III to cover this up.
[01:04:30.744 --> 01:04:32.925]  I mean, we gotta realize we're dealing with vicious killers here.
[01:04:33.846 --> 01:04:34.347]  That's right.
[01:04:34.547 --> 01:04:41.753]  They are evil, evil people, and they are going to have another war, and I've been talking about that on this program for some time.
[01:04:42.799 --> 01:04:43.379]  Bob, stay there.
[01:04:43.419 --> 01:04:51.043]  Let's talk more about the economy and how fast the deepening depression is accelerating and how bad it's going to get with Bob Chapman.
[01:04:51.063 --> 01:04:57.906]  Then, scheduled later, we got Lindsey Williams popping in to take your calls and get more into how they're imploding the oil markets by design.
[01:04:57.926 --> 01:05:01.568]  In fact, John, get that clip ready from the Davos thing with George Soros.
[01:05:01.588 --> 01:05:02.369]  We haven't even played that yet.
[01:05:02.389 --> 01:05:03.029]  We've had it for weeks.
[01:05:03.669 --> 01:05:04.710]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:06.250]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:05:09.392 --> 01:05:11.333]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[01:05:11.946 --> 01:05:14.453]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[01:05:15.014 --> 01:05:19.206]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[01:05:19.955 --> 01:05:21.696]  You know that you need to prepare.
[01:05:22.056 --> 01:05:25.077]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[01:05:25.457 --> 01:05:28.418]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.

[01:06:07.879 --> 01:06:09.299]  It is a big idea.
[01:06:09.319 --> 01:06:11.421]  A new world order.
[01:06:12.121 --> 01:06:16.464]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:06:17.023 --> 01:06:18.784]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:06:19.825 --> 01:06:22.067]  Put their objective being world domination.
[01:06:22.627 --> 01:06:25.069]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:06:25.809 --> 01:06:33.134]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:06:36.144 --> 01:06:41.127]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:06:41.588 --> 01:06:45.050]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:47.972]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:06:48.032 --> 01:06:49.173]  Most people have no idea.
[01:06:49.193 --> 01:06:49.953]  They're not after money.
[01:06:49.993 --> 01:06:51.054]  They have all the money they need.
[01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:51.975]  They're after power.
[01:06:52.015 --> 01:06:53.095]  That's what they're after these days.
[01:06:53.396 --> 01:06:57.919]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:06:58.139 --> 01:07:01.621]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:04.503]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:07:04.903 --> 01:07:05.984]  You have been warned.
[01:07:07.084 --> 01:07:07.625]  You worry.
[01:07:07.985 --> 01:07:09.706]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:07:10.066 --> 01:07:12.287]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:07:12.707 --> 01:07:14.508]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:07:14.828 --> 01:07:16.029]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:19.631]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:07:20.031 --> 01:07:24.893]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:07:25.273 --> 01:07:28.575]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:07:29.244 --> 01:07:30.565]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:07:30.925 --> 01:07:33.526]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[01:07:33.826 --> 01:07:36.787]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:07:37.267 --> 01:07:45.450]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:50.312]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:03.477]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:08:03.998 --> 01:08:06.039]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:08.881]  Big Brother!
[01:08:13.564 --> 01:08:14.605]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:15.346 --> 01:08:16.448]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:17.108 --> 01:08:17.909]  You want answers?
[01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:19.571]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:19.591 --> 01:08:23.836]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.437 --> 01:08:28.482]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:31.906 --> 01:08:34.669]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:34.689 --> 01:08:42.617]  Don't forget, March 15th, the Obama Deception Props at PrisonPlanet.tv and SuperhighQuality, an information warfare weapon.
[01:08:43.078 --> 01:08:45.861]  Who the bankers are, how they control things, how Obama's their puppet.
[01:08:46.141 --> 01:09:01.173]  How Bush was their puppet, how it's seamless integration for administration to administration, setting up their world government, their carbon taxes, total control, all of his lies, what his real agenda is, the FEMA camps, the forced conscription, the state's revolting, the film is done, the film's been sent off to be mass-produced.
[01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:04.957]  We'll probably have it the next seven days and start packaging them up to ship out on the 15th.
[01:09:05.237 --> 01:09:10.382]  Get your orders in at Infowars.com right now or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:09:10.442 --> 01:09:20.292]  They're betting that he can neutralize the left and the general public to stand down while they launch their new world order so they can stage their terror attacks and start huge wars.
[01:09:20.352 --> 01:09:21.133]  They're doing it all.
[01:09:21.173 --> 01:09:21.974]  They're moving ahead.
[01:09:22.294 --> 01:09:24.837]  If we expose their agenda now, and believe me, these films have power.
[01:09:25.297 --> 01:09:31.119]  If you spread it out to everybody, make copies of the DVD, download it from PrisonPlanet.tv, spread it out to everybody.
[01:09:31.139 --> 01:09:33.240]  If you go crazy with this, it will have a big effect.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.361]  Believe me, we have more power than a lot of you actually realize and know.
[01:09:38.061 --> 01:09:45.324]  Bob Chapman, the International Forecaster, if people just realize they can take action and defeat this thing, we can do it.
[01:09:45.964 --> 01:09:47.925]  But really, folks need to understand that, don't they?
[01:09:49.105 --> 01:09:49.926]  They certainly do.
[01:09:50.626 --> 01:09:53.987]  And your program goes a long way toward accomplishing that.
[01:09:54.779 --> 01:09:57.382]  And please, when you get these tapes, make copies.
[01:09:57.482 --> 01:09:59.564]  Send them all over the place, all over the world.
[01:10:00.184 --> 01:10:01.645]  Let people know what's going on.
[01:10:02.326 --> 01:10:03.807]  It's just like with my publication.
[01:10:03.888 --> 01:10:07.951]  You know, I tell people who are subscribers, if you want to send it to other people, do it.
[01:10:08.011 --> 01:10:12.936]  Some of them will subscribe because they want to get their own copy, but that's not what the mission is.
[01:10:13.016 --> 01:10:18.301]  The mission is to get the story out, to make people understand who the real enemy is.
[01:10:19.105 --> 01:10:20.025]  Absolutely, Bob.
[01:10:20.045 --> 01:10:23.447]  When I say this, I'm not putting a good face on it.
[01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:24.027]  It's the truth.
[01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:25.967]  The military's waking up.
[01:10:26.007 --> 01:10:28.889]  More contributions than Ron Paul, than to any other candidate, including the Democrat.
[01:10:29.129 --> 01:10:29.949]  I'm not saying this Republican.
[01:10:29.969 --> 01:10:30.929]  No, it's all candidates.
[01:10:31.489 --> 01:10:31.890]  They know.
[01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:33.030]  The police are waking up.
[01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:39.612]  If people become aware of stage terror, stage financial collapse, and learn this is a bunch of made-off criminals running things.
[01:10:39.632 --> 01:10:41.033]  I mean, he was the founder of the Nasdaq.
[01:10:41.613 --> 01:10:50.040]  And that all these banks are involved in this by design, and they learned how the IMF and World Bank bankrupt countries like Argentina, Iceland, and others, and now doing it here in England and Europe by design.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.021]  We can defeat these people.
[01:10:52.041 --> 01:10:55.324]  I mean, bottom line, folks, we've got to tell the truth.
[01:10:55.344 --> 01:10:59.347]  We've got to get the story out there, because the enemy is so obviously criminal.
[01:10:59.407 --> 01:11:01.669]  If we just tell the truth, they're going to be defeated.
[01:11:03.431 --> 01:11:11.117]  And I think what, to go along with this, Alex, is the fact that we have projected on your program that the
[01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:18.073]  Economy is going to do what exactly what it has done over the past five years, you know, gone into the sewer.
[01:11:18.693 --> 01:11:25.916]  And your program and my publication and a handful of others, very few, unfortunately, have projected this.
[01:11:26.276 --> 01:11:27.977]  And we've been right all along.
[01:11:28.097 --> 01:11:33.320]  So, ladies and gentlemen, the audience, please listen, because we get the handle on this.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.740]  We know what we're talking about.
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.761]  We know where this is going.
[01:11:38.422 --> 01:11:41.063]  You've got to listen and you've got to act, because
[01:11:41.844 --> 01:11:49.107]  When unemployment continues to expand, the U6 is really about 15.5% right now.
[01:11:49.567 --> 01:11:54.249]  That's a government figure, that's intermediate unemployment, and not to go into detail on it.
[01:11:54.809 --> 01:11:56.950]  And that'll be over 22% this year.
[01:11:57.890 --> 01:12:00.051]  And next year, it'll go higher.
[01:12:00.651 --> 01:12:10.915]  And as more and more people become discontented, all this information, particularly the tapes that you have, they will be put into fertile hands because people will start listening
[01:12:11.388 --> 01:12:14.409]  And saying to themselves, who did this to me?
[01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:18.611]  And we're going to tell them who and how to change things.
[01:12:18.931 --> 01:12:19.351]  That's right.
[01:12:19.391 --> 01:12:28.315]  But if we're not there, and remember, we're the people that told you 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago, as this was unfolding, America was a big country to take down, to bring in a tyranny.
[01:12:28.335 --> 01:12:34.197]  But they slowly took over all the institutions, they set it up, and we always knew they'd have a financial implosion to do it.
[01:12:34.657 --> 01:12:36.679]  This is the final coup de grace, as they say.
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.883]  The globalists admit they're using this as an opportunity for their New World Order.
[01:12:41.283 --> 01:12:46.408]  We have to use this as an opportunity, like Judo, as they attack us, to use their force against them.
[01:12:46.448 --> 01:12:48.630]  I want to play a video clip of George Soros a few weeks ago.
[01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:54.215]  This dovetails with what Lindsey Williams said about not just imploding other commodities in oil.
[01:12:54.475 --> 01:12:58.559]  He said this back when it was $147 a barrel, because he knows a big oil company he executively worked with.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.541]  He said it was going to drop down below 50.
[01:13:00.681 --> 01:13:01.882]  It's gone as low as 33.
[01:13:02.582 --> 01:13:03.803]  It's right up at 40 right now.
[01:13:03.823 --> 01:13:17.191]  And he said a year and a half down the road it would go back into hyperinflation to bankrupt Russia, bankrupt Venezuela, bankrupt Canada, bankrupt the oil fields of Texas and Oklahoma.
[01:13:18.763 --> 01:13:23.126]  So they're doing this to create a depression while they hyperinflate and buy everything up.
[01:13:23.526 --> 01:13:25.868]  So let's go ahead and play that clip and get Bob Chapman's take on this.
[01:13:25.908 --> 01:13:28.870]  Here is George Soros admitting that, oh, it's okay that oil is plunging.
[01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:32.712]  This is being used basically as a weapon to bring down the Arab states and other nations.
[01:13:32.733 --> 01:13:33.073]  Here it is.
[01:13:33.706 --> 01:13:39.367]  At bank efforts going on in the United States, but there's so much else to be discussed here because this is after all the World Economic Forum.
[01:13:39.387 --> 01:13:41.508]  Let's talk for a moment about the price of oil.
[01:13:41.928 --> 01:13:45.148]  What are the implications of $40 oil in your mind?
[01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:50.710]  Well, it's a sudden reversal of fortunes for the oil-producing countries.
[01:13:51.490 --> 01:13:59.471]  And in the Gulf states, you have quite a few bubbles popping.
[01:14:00.312 --> 01:14:01.972]  Dubai was one of the
[01:14:02.492 --> 01:14:08.038]  Probably the biggest real estate bubble in the world and it's now bursting.
[01:14:08.538 --> 01:14:19.149]  However, it's not all bad news because the major oil producing countries have been the enemies of the prevailing world order, Venezuela, Iran.
[01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.691]  Russia.
[01:14:21.611 --> 01:14:28.336]  And it's not so easy to finance a Bolivarian revolution with $40 oil.
[01:14:28.777 --> 01:14:33.880]  So I think Venezuela, Chavez, probably his days are numbered.
[01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:38.684]  And in Iran, I think that he's not going to last a year.
[01:14:40.686 --> 01:14:46.151]  Maybe wrong, but I mean he's under considerable duress and his influence is going to decline.
[01:14:46.652 --> 01:14:55.300]  In Iran, Ahmadinejad is up for elections in 2009 and unless he can provoke some
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:05.164]  I think that he's liable to also be defeated and you may have a more reasonable regime.
[01:15:06.725 --> 01:15:15.769]  Now, Russia is more troubling because there, you see, Putin
[01:15:16.449 --> 01:15:35.341]  has been using oil for a number of reasons to re-establish Russia's geopolitical influence, to enrich the rulers, to maintain themselves in power, and to bribe the rulers of the neighboring countries to gain control over their gas.
[01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:41.365]  But through the success, he was very popular.
[01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:58.760]  And now, suddenly, you have financial collapse, inflation, ruble falling, living standards falling, and there's a danger
[01:15:59.714 --> 01:16:12.120]  That he will be more adventurous trying to have some foreign adventure, Ukraine, whatever, to divert attention.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.360]  I'm afraid we have to end it there.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.981]  George Soros, I'd like to thank you very much.
[01:16:15.021 --> 01:16:16.862]  We didn't get to China, but we heard lots about Russia.
[01:16:16.882 --> 01:16:19.663]  That is George Soros, live from Davos, the World Economic Forum.
[01:16:21.226 --> 01:16:22.907]  Now understand, this is the perfect plan.
[01:16:22.947 --> 01:16:25.628]  Destroy the economy, destroy oil, consolidate everything.
[01:16:25.648 --> 01:16:34.873]  The banks hoard the bailout money given to them by every European and Western nation, including the US and Canada, in over 20 trillion total, just 9.7 trillion here in the United States alone of our tax money.
[01:16:35.354 --> 01:16:40.697]  This is their big, massive move, and they're Soros admitting
[01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:48.421]  All of this, but then claiming that Putin is starting things, and Venezuela is starting things, and Iran is starting things.
[01:16:48.441 --> 01:16:53.603]  When Iran has terrorists from the United States and Israel, they admit, the White House admits, staging terror attacks.
[01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:57.125]  Wahhabis, actually Al-Qaeda, working with the globalists, as they always do, attacking them.
[01:16:57.425 --> 01:16:58.265]  They're taking it.
[01:16:58.886 --> 01:16:59.726]  All of this is happening.
[01:16:59.746 --> 01:17:04.328]  They staged the sneak attack on Russian-held areas in South Ossetia and Abkhazia back on 888.
[01:17:05.589 --> 01:17:08.811]  The media claimed that Russia had a snug attack and had to admit that was a hoax.
[01:17:10.472 --> 01:17:11.973]  We can really see their move.
[01:17:11.993 --> 01:17:17.877]  And here's Soros, who implodes economies on a smaller scale to make his tens of billions in the past through currency manipulation.
[01:17:17.917 --> 01:17:19.918]  Now he's posing like the good guy here.
[01:17:19.938 --> 01:17:21.119]  This is amazing, Bob Chapman.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.160]  Yeah, it is.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:29.984]  And it bears out what you said earlier in the program, that they're coming out into the open because they're being forced to.
[01:17:30.925 --> 01:17:33.927]  Not only by the knowledge that we're spreading throughout the world, but also
[01:17:35.275 --> 01:17:41.439]  The BRIC nations, as they're called, have pushed the Illuminists into a corner as well.
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:47.464]  What he says about Venezuela and Iran is true.
[01:17:47.504 --> 01:17:55.610]  In the case of Venezuela, the popularity of Mr. Chavez is down to 54% from over 60%.
[01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:57.311]  And that's understandable.
[01:17:57.431 --> 01:18:00.753]  There's not as much money to go around under his regime.
[01:18:03.768 --> 01:18:16.054]  As well as in Venezuela, you have the CIA and others who are trying to undermine the governments in those countries.
[01:18:16.934 --> 01:18:31.741]  And this Stanford affair that just happened, which they're trying to keep it undercover, was a government operation which is very similar to the Australian Nugent hand episode that went on in the, I think it was the late 80s.
[01:18:33.027 --> 01:18:38.392]  And which I won't get into here, but it was another government operation.
[01:18:39.092 --> 01:18:58.668]  And what George doesn't tell you is that he was the one who financed and organized all of these incursions into the Baltic countries, as well as Ukraine and others, with these orange and red and violet revolutions, which has caused Russia so much trouble.
[01:18:59.429 --> 01:19:00.710]  And this is
[01:19:01.563 --> 01:19:05.246]  Intelligence warfare, and he's behind a good part of it.
[01:19:06.167 --> 01:19:16.476]  So, for him to come out and say what he said, which could have been said by you, Alex, or I, because that is what's happening.
[01:19:17.777 --> 01:19:22.441]  For him to have to admit that, you know that they're on their backsides.
[01:19:22.461 --> 01:19:23.782]  They're wondering, what do we do next?
[01:19:26.897 --> 01:19:32.620]  It's amazing though that, again, we told people this six months ago, and now it's at Davos two weeks ago.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:37.162]  I mean, everything we tell you is what's happening, because we really know how the geopolitical system works.
[01:19:37.222 --> 01:19:38.763]  We know who the globalist are.
[01:19:38.803 --> 01:19:39.843]  We're right about this.
[01:19:39.903 --> 01:19:47.567]  Bob, I want to do five more minutes with you on the other side, because I want you to talk about these latest Ponzi schemes that are imploding, and how their intelligence operations, the National
[01:19:49.113 --> 01:19:58.041]  The Securities and Exchange Commission coming out and saying national security on Madoff and other issues, admitting the White House is involved in all of this, stealing your pension funds, folks.
[01:19:58.381 --> 01:20:06.668]  These are nothing but banker criminals using the intelligence agencies in the West they founded and Homeland Security to oppress the people while they thieve.
[01:20:07.728 --> 01:20:14.935]  Yourfoodstorage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest-priced, highest-quality, storable food for over a decade.
[01:20:15.095 --> 01:20:19.299]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds four to five people is only $39.95.
[01:20:19.379 --> 01:20:21.100]  That's right.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:24.343]  A one-year supply that feeds four to five people for under $4,000.
[01:20:28.166 --> 01:20:28.746]  I don't know.
[01:20:46.246 --> 01:20:50.848]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:13.975 --> 01:21:21.742]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:22.082 --> 01:21:29.969]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:35.014]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:35.354 --> 01:21:40.056]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:40.577 --> 01:21:44.418]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:44.919 --> 01:21:45.939]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:45.999 --> 01:21:50.081]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:50.501 --> 01:21:54.903]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:55.404 --> 01:21:57.925]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:58.385 --> 01:22:00.507]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.647 --> 01:22:04.070]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:05.211 --> 01:22:13.078]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:22:13.438 --> 01:22:15.140]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:22:16.078 --> 01:22:17.099]  But who is the enemy?
[01:22:17.619 --> 01:22:18.160]  Bin Laden.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:19.341]  This is his M.O.
[01:22:19.361 --> 01:22:20.722]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:22.464]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:22:22.784 --> 01:22:29.550]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:30.391]  Some U.S.
[01:22:30.431 --> 01:22:36.096]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:22:36.756 --> 01:22:40.277]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:22:40.297 --> 01:22:43.058]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:09.652]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:23:10.092 --> 01:23:13.375]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:19.799]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:23:20.179 --> 01:23:24.322]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:23:24.802 --> 01:23:30.526]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:23:30.826 --> 01:23:33.828]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.930]  I think so.
[01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:13.297]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:13.978 --> 01:24:16.283]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:17.714 --> 01:24:20.075]  Lindsay Williams is always very punctual about interviews.
[01:24:20.095 --> 01:24:22.757]  We may have gotten a time zone wrong with him, or he may have gotten one wrong.
[01:24:22.897 --> 01:24:25.078]  He'll probably be on in the next hour, if not tomorrow.
[01:24:25.098 --> 01:24:28.199]  But we've got Bob Chapman on with us right now.
[01:24:28.219 --> 01:24:31.601]  And I wanted to get Williams on and play this Soros clip, so take your calls.
[01:24:31.681 --> 01:24:33.442]  Calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:33.462 --> 01:24:40.866]  A bunch of other news I haven't gotten to, and we have another state rep from another state moving to declare sovereignty, popping in the last 15 minutes of the show today.
[01:24:41.506 --> 01:24:46.949]  Bob Chapman, it's clear that Obama is another color revolution, just like the CIA and Soros on record funded
[01:24:47.329 --> 01:24:48.170]  Well, that capsulizes it.
[01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:49.391]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:24:49.471 --> 01:24:51.713]  And they're going to continue to use these artifices and devices
[01:25:17.031 --> 01:25:46.517]  to mislead the public and you know the public isn't educated in these matters uh... you know most of them once they get a job and they're going through life they don't educate themselves further they would rather uh... watch the news and watch programs on television or sporting events and so it's up to us to tell them what what is being done to them and how people are pulling the wool over their eyes and this color thing is is one of those artifices which they use
[01:25:48.024 --> 01:25:51.046]  Describe for those that don't know why they call it a color revolution.
[01:25:54.309 --> 01:25:56.671]  It's just a piece of misdirection.
[01:25:57.652 --> 01:26:06.538]  It's to make people think that there's actually a popular uprising within a country.
[01:26:06.779 --> 01:26:08.420]  We'll take Ukraine as an example.
[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:12.723]  And by putting a color on it, it changes everything.
[01:26:13.344 --> 01:26:17.667]  It allows people to follow something rather than an individual.
[01:26:18.334 --> 01:26:21.178]  Uh, following a colored movement like Purple.
[01:26:22.099 --> 01:26:28.247]  And, uh, and that's how they get away with what they're doing, and then they convince the people that they should change the government.
[01:26:28.877 --> 01:26:30.618]  Which they did in a number of these countries.
[01:26:30.638 --> 01:26:35.600]  So it's staged false revolutions, because they know worldwide the people are in revolt.
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:54.870]  That's in the Pentagon, the public documents, that's in the British Ministry of Defense plans, and they admit the public is revolting against globalism, so every time the public revolts, the establishment goes in with a fake revolution, and that's what we've got to watch, with Glenn Beck and others now posing as our saviors, but mixing all the lies and pro-war rhetoric into the middle of it.
[01:26:55.930 --> 01:26:57.371]  You have nailed it down.
[01:26:58.784 --> 01:26:59.585]  Absolutely.
[01:26:59.645 --> 01:27:01.265]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[01:27:01.285 --> 01:27:14.892]  Go back to the 1950s and read the first books on brainwashing, which had, you know, come into publishing at that time as a result of what went on during the Korean War.
[01:27:15.432 --> 01:27:17.213]  And the fundamentals are all there.
[01:27:17.373 --> 01:27:19.234]  I mean, I studied them because I had to.
[01:27:19.975 --> 01:27:22.396]  And fortunately, I must say.
[01:27:22.416 --> 01:27:26.538]  And every place that they've started these
[01:27:28.217 --> 01:27:28.717]  We're good.
[01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:48.251]  Yeah, that's what the Balkans were about.
[01:27:48.311 --> 01:27:52.114]  I mean, when we take the Big Color Revolution of 1917, 1918, we're on record.
[01:27:52.134 --> 01:28:03.782]  New York and London banks publicly funded the Bolsheviks, tens of thousands of terrorists with weapons and trainloads of gold, to go in and blow out the Tsars, who were, you know, not saying they're perfect.
[01:28:03.802 --> 01:28:08.525]  The point is, that was the British cousins knocking off their other cousins, the Tsars, on record.
[01:28:09.206 --> 01:28:11.287]  And, you know, they killed 40 million people.
[01:28:11.327 --> 01:28:12.208]  This is what they do.
[01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:14.081]  That's right.
[01:28:14.762 --> 01:28:16.202]  That's exactly what they do.
[01:28:16.242 --> 01:28:22.325]  You know, when the Russian established government at that time, the monarchy, was getting hit from both sides.
[01:28:23.266 --> 01:28:30.750]  They had the Germans on one side attacking them, and then they had the Red Forces against the White Army, getting it from the other side.
[01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:32.511]  It was a brutal situation.
[01:28:33.771 --> 01:28:34.411]  Absolutely.
[01:28:36.331 --> 01:28:40.552]  They know what they're doing, but if the public is aware of these operations, they fall apart.
[01:28:40.572 --> 01:28:41.112]  And you're right.
[01:28:41.232 --> 01:28:51.415]  More and more, their false flag ops, their NATO options, the different systems that they've been using, are blowing up in their face.
[01:28:51.935 --> 01:28:52.735]  They are not working.
[01:28:53.975 --> 01:29:00.577]  Well, we can't let government get away with what they got away with some years ago in BCCI.
[01:29:01.117 --> 01:29:03.978]  And this is what the Stanford thing is, I believe.
[01:29:04.491 --> 01:29:13.498]  I'm only guessing at this point, but I do know that the employees that Stanford had in Venezuela were paid by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:29:15.239 --> 01:29:16.120]  I've got to stop you again.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:19.202]  I know I said I was going to let you go, and I want to go to calls, but quick break.
[01:29:19.242 --> 01:29:20.543]  We'll do four more minutes on the side.
[01:29:20.563 --> 01:29:22.004]  Plug the newsletter, too.
[01:29:22.024 --> 01:29:24.706]  Because I forgot last segment, I said I wanted you to talk about that.
[01:29:24.987 --> 01:29:30.471]  The Madoff things, the Stanford deals, more and more of these Ponzi schemes, always with national security being declared around them.
[01:29:30.911 --> 01:29:40.135]  What is the point of all the money, you know, these business fronts where they put Wall Street money in to go infiltrate countries, including our own, and they do it by stealing police, firemen, and teachers' pension funds.
[01:29:40.495 --> 01:29:41.335]  And we'll break that down.
[01:29:41.416 --> 01:29:42.396]  Bob, you can do five more minutes?
[01:29:43.937 --> 01:29:44.777]  Anytime you want.
[01:29:45.077 --> 01:29:45.777]  Alright, you're the best.
[01:29:46.478 --> 01:29:47.438]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[01:29:47.458 --> 01:29:48.398]  Your phone call straight ahead.
[01:29:48.439 --> 01:29:50.139]  A ton of news and a lot more.
[01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:50.619]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.659 --> 01:29:51.600]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:29:57.893 --> 01:30:00.877]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.818 --> 01:30:04.501]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:07.682 --> 01:30:17.770]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:30:18.251 --> 01:30:19.312]  Garden in a Can.
[01:30:19.672 --> 01:30:23.255]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[01:30:23.815 --> 01:30:25.577]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:28.119]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[01:30:28.579 --> 01:30:37.646]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[01:30:38.267 --> 01:30:39.268]  Garden in a can.
[01:30:39.688 --> 01:30:40.549]  It's that simple.

[01:31:06.607 --> 01:31:08.629]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:31:08.749 --> 01:31:11.171]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:31:11.191 --> 01:31:13.733]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:31:13.753 --> 01:31:14.974]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:31:15.034 --> 01:31:16.595]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:31:16.715 --> 01:31:19.517]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[01:31:19.537 --> 01:31:24.581]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the UNICEF.
[01:31:32.903 --> 01:31:37.796]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:31:41.554 --> 01:31:42.615]  How dare you?
[01:31:42.795 --> 01:31:49.041]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:31:49.222 --> 01:31:51.884]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:31:51.964 --> 01:31:58.391]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:32:03.535 --> 01:32:06.018]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:32:06.972 --> 01:32:10.354]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:32:10.494 --> 01:32:15.698]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:32:15.898 --> 01:32:20.661]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:32.169]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:32:32.549 --> 01:32:38.111]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:32:38.331 --> 01:32:44.392]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:32:44.592 --> 01:32:45.253]  What about you?
[01:32:45.633 --> 01:32:51.674]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:33:11.983 --> 01:33:22.027]  You know, if you study history, the Roman Empire, the Byzantines, the Chinese Empires, the Qin, the Japanese, humans act the same.
[01:33:22.047 --> 01:33:22.667]  People are people.
[01:33:24.159 --> 01:33:26.141]  Africa, people are people.
[01:33:26.822 --> 01:33:34.631]  I mean, in basic villages, between villages, there's subterfuge, backstabbing, cliques, secret societies, intelligence operations.
[01:33:37.254 --> 01:33:44.282]  And they somehow told everybody, go out and play the Worlds of Wonderland, it's safe, have fun, leave your government alone, let them operate in secret under national security.
[01:33:46.599 --> 01:33:48.300]  We got used as military slaves.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:49.640]  We lost our freedoms.
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:51.401]  We got taxed to fund the New World Order.
[01:33:51.841 --> 01:33:53.682]  And now they're really getting ready to make us serfs.
[01:33:55.082 --> 01:33:56.183]  They're fully dropping the hammer.
[01:33:56.623 --> 01:33:57.723]  They're done just using us.
[01:33:57.763 --> 01:34:01.125]  They want to make us basically bankrupt slaves.
[01:34:01.545 --> 01:34:06.107]  So we have no economic power to have jobs, to go to college.
[01:34:07.067 --> 01:34:11.829]  The globalists constantly say they want poor, stupid serfs living in basically squalor.
[01:34:13.029 --> 01:34:14.350]  Compact city control grids.
[01:34:16.796 --> 01:34:17.616]  And it's here.
[01:34:18.557 --> 01:34:22.158]  History is nothing but empires and slaughter and death and evil people taking control.
[01:34:22.518 --> 01:34:27.859]  There's a few precious times when people of vision who love humanity have gotten in control.
[01:34:27.899 --> 01:34:30.980]  They've set up systems to tie down tyranny, to tie down government.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:35.001]  And it's never been perfect, but under those systems, milk and honey flows.
[01:34:35.621 --> 01:34:37.842]  Creativity, inventiveness explodes.
[01:34:37.982 --> 01:34:38.622]  Renaissance.
[01:34:39.963 --> 01:34:44.404]  The globalists want to put us back into a post-industrial world, in their words.
[01:34:46.107 --> 01:34:47.147]  They want to control.
[01:34:47.187 --> 01:34:48.407]  That's what the carbon taxes are.
[01:34:48.447 --> 01:34:49.928]  This is hellish we're facing.
[01:34:50.028 --> 01:34:50.468]  Wake up!
[01:34:50.848 --> 01:34:51.808]  Stop being children.
[01:34:52.148 --> 01:34:53.248]  Join the fight of your life.
[01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:55.509]  We have a good chance of winning if you'll get up.
[01:34:56.249 --> 01:34:59.410]  The fake Christian churches are government-paid for.
[01:34:59.450 --> 01:35:00.350]  They tell folks, lay down.
[01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:01.170]  It's the end of the world.
[01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:02.330]  Rejoice that things are getting bad.
[01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:03.291]  Jesus will be here soon.
[01:35:03.711 --> 01:35:04.691]  It's made up, folks.
[01:35:04.951 --> 01:35:09.372]  But even if it was the end of the world next week, you have a moral duty to fight evil and corruption.
[01:35:09.592 --> 01:35:13.813]  Bob Chapman, a comment on that, and then let's get your quick take on these Ponzi schemes.
[01:35:13.873 --> 01:35:14.553]  You had said
[01:35:15.293 --> 01:35:21.216]  When the Mayo thing first broke, you had intelligence sources on air, you wrote about the newsletter, that it was a scam with the U.S.
[01:35:21.256 --> 01:35:23.157]  government and Israel fencing the money.
[01:35:23.677 --> 01:35:29.300]  Then it did start coming out in mainstream news that he had government connections, he was allowed to stay in his house, ship gold and diamonds out.
[01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:34.503]  I mean, obviously one guy didn't steal 50 to 100 million dollars by himself, they claim he ran it all himself.
[01:35:34.863 --> 01:35:36.304]  His sons have moved to Latin America.
[01:35:38.106 --> 01:35:40.128]  And then you said other Ponzi schemes would come out.
[01:35:40.168 --> 01:35:42.730]  Every time they do, there's all these intelligence agencies connections.
[01:35:43.050 --> 01:35:50.356]  And then a few weeks ago in congressional testimony, the Securities and Exchange Commission said, we will not testify on this.
[01:35:50.376 --> 01:35:53.358]  We're declaring national security, presidential directives.
[01:35:53.658 --> 01:35:55.139]  This is a national security issue.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:58.362]  And they were saying for nine years, you were told this was a scam.
[01:35:59.463 --> 01:36:00.043]  And you did nothing.
[01:36:00.063 --> 01:36:01.745]  And they said, we declare national security.
[01:36:01.785 --> 01:36:02.585]  We played that clip here.
[01:36:03.406 --> 01:36:05.688]  That is an admission right there, Bob, that you were right.
[01:36:08.172 --> 01:36:11.753]  The SEC have been on my case since 1967.
[01:36:14.194 --> 01:36:15.614]  And they have never let up.
[01:36:16.535 --> 01:36:19.396]  And they are nothing but a criminal organization.
[01:36:20.116 --> 01:36:25.838]  And they are working with the major brokerage firms, the banks, to perpetuate profit.
[01:36:26.318 --> 01:36:29.099]  They won't even put the uptick rule back in for shorting.
[01:36:29.439 --> 01:36:31.159]  They won't even stop making shorting.
[01:36:31.439 --> 01:36:36.421]  But they've got plenty of time to go and put small brokerage houses, small brokers,
[01:36:36.852 --> 01:36:38.593]  And newsletter writers out of business.
[01:36:39.713 --> 01:36:41.353]  And so the proof is all there.
[01:36:41.954 --> 01:36:44.875]  Madoff, it took hundreds of people to pull that scam.
[01:36:45.275 --> 01:36:46.275]  Where did the money go?
[01:36:46.315 --> 01:36:47.155]  They don't want to tell you.
[01:36:47.215 --> 01:36:48.176]  It's a state secret.
[01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:57.298]  The latest is the apartment worth $7 million or $70 million or whatever it is that he is allowed to live in, if you can believe this.
[01:36:57.738 --> 01:37:00.919]  This man is a criminal, an admitted criminal.
[01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:04.481]  And it all belongs to his wife, so she should keep it.
[01:37:04.901 --> 01:37:05.761]  Give me a break.
[01:37:06.547 --> 01:37:16.894]  There's no way they're going to be able to prove that, because the only way she can keep that is to prove that those things were given to her by somebody else, and that is not the case.
[01:37:17.495 --> 01:37:26.461]  And do you think somebody, or a number of people, are going to go up and lie about having given her that apartment, or having given her other things?
[01:37:26.621 --> 01:37:33.967]  Well, look at how they're protecting him, and I don't know if you watched those hearings in Congress, I watched quite a bit of it, working on the Obama deception.
[01:37:34.963 --> 01:37:41.228]  The SEC kept defending Madoff, saying it's not proven, he's not guilty, and they're like, he's confessed!
[01:37:42.228 --> 01:37:44.630]  And they said, national security, national security.
[01:37:45.611 --> 01:37:48.533]  Well, that's the level that I operate at.
[01:37:49.053 --> 01:37:51.896]  And I'll tell you, I've nailed them time after time.
[01:37:52.276 --> 01:37:57.900]  And the CFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation, is every bit as bad.
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:03.224]  And they're the ones who are in the com-ex and the commodity market.
[01:38:03.809 --> 01:38:04.349]  I don't
[01:38:26.161 --> 01:38:28.902]  And all of the big business leaders are for this.
[01:38:29.122 --> 01:38:30.043]  A parking tax?
[01:38:31.443 --> 01:38:36.205]  They want to put a gasoline tax of 26 cents a gallon on.
[01:38:36.605 --> 01:38:40.087]  That's one of the reasons they brought gasoline down, so they could do that.
[01:38:40.487 --> 01:38:42.648]  And next they'll have a U.N.
[01:38:42.728 --> 01:38:50.771]  gasoline tax, which will fund those international... No, no, they've announced there's going to be a tax on children, a carbon tax.
[01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:51.771]  You can just Google that.
[01:38:51.791 --> 01:38:53.092]  It's all over the news how great it is.
[01:38:54.355 --> 01:38:59.337]  The very criminal bankers that have run all these scams, now setting up world government where we pay our taxes to them.
[01:38:59.397 --> 01:38:59.877]  It's incredible.
[01:39:00.177 --> 01:39:02.398]  Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:39:02.418 --> 01:39:04.199]  Folks, get a free copy of it there or subscribe.
[01:39:04.219 --> 01:39:05.440]  Get it twice a week electronically.
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.821]  Or how often does the hard copy that gets mailed out go out?
[01:39:09.472 --> 01:39:12.193]  That goes out twice a month for those who are not on the internet.
[01:39:12.393 --> 01:39:14.973]  Alright, so TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:39:15.493 --> 01:39:17.934]  Bob Chavin, we'll talk to you again on Friday.
[01:39:18.094 --> 01:39:20.855]  So much is happening that we'll need you back on again.
[01:39:20.915 --> 01:39:21.575]  Thank you so much.
[01:39:21.615 --> 01:39:26.996]  Your knowledge and foresight and understanding of this is invaluable and you continue to be proven absolutely dead on.
[01:39:27.016 --> 01:39:27.556]  God bless you.
[01:39:28.397 --> 01:39:29.237]  Thank you very much.
[01:39:29.457 --> 01:39:29.757]  Bye-bye.
[01:39:30.222 --> 01:39:30.442]  You bet.
[01:39:30.462 --> 01:39:31.343]  There goes Bob Chapman.
[01:39:31.943 --> 01:39:34.965]  As I said, Lindsey Williams is always on target, always on time.
[01:39:35.626 --> 01:39:37.627]  Time zone issue is something he may be coming in the next hour.
[01:39:37.667 --> 01:39:38.808]  If not, he'll be on the next few days.
[01:39:38.828 --> 01:39:40.749]  There's a lot of new developments there.
[01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:44.012]  I wanted to have Lindsey on, but right now, let's go to Mark in Wisconsin.
[01:39:44.052 --> 01:39:44.832]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:39:47.614 --> 01:39:47.895]  Hello?
[01:39:48.715 --> 01:39:49.155]  Yes, Mark.
[01:39:50.216 --> 01:39:51.137]  Hi, what's going on?
[01:39:51.297 --> 01:39:53.058]  A long time listener, big fan.
[01:39:53.098 --> 01:39:54.059]  You're one of my heroes.
[01:39:54.079 --> 01:39:55.000]  Just wanted to get that out.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:58.222]  I know you're probably pressed for time, so I'll just get right into the issue.
[01:39:59.051 --> 01:40:00.012]  I'm from Wisconsin.
[01:40:00.052 --> 01:40:03.954]  As far as I can tell, my state is not part of the state sovereignty movement.
[01:40:05.255 --> 01:40:06.336]  We've really got to push for that.
[01:40:06.356 --> 01:40:12.580]  Right in front of me I have the number, if I can give it out, for Senator Russ Feingold's office.
[01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:14.281]  Area code 202.
[01:40:14.361 --> 01:40:18.004]  Hold on, wouldn't you want to call the state legislature instead of the federal senator?
[01:40:20.133 --> 01:40:21.294]  Uh, you may be right.
[01:40:21.354 --> 01:40:24.417]  That's the only number I was able to get with his Washington office.
[01:40:24.517 --> 01:40:26.098]  I do have the local offices.
[01:40:26.218 --> 01:40:27.780]  Let's see, he's a federal senator.
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:29.001]  They want federal control.
[01:40:29.381 --> 01:40:30.782]  You want to call the legislature?
[01:40:31.843 --> 01:40:32.704]  The state government?
[01:40:34.585 --> 01:40:35.106]  Uh, I gotcha.
[01:40:36.227 --> 01:40:38.349]  I mean, go ahead and give Feingold's number out if you want.
[01:40:38.409 --> 01:40:38.929]  I mean, go ahead.
[01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:41.591]  Alright, that number is area code 202-224-5323.
[01:40:47.734 --> 01:40:53.839]  What would your suggestion be then as far as webpages to pull up for local representatives?
[01:40:53.859 --> 01:40:54.559]  Good day Alex, how are you?
[01:40:54.579 --> 01:40:54.700]  Good.
[01:41:16.543 --> 01:41:22.589]  Just to let you know, you're talking about this Glenn Beck TV fiasco, I guess.
[01:41:23.670 --> 01:41:32.298]  Just to let the listeners know, I just sent the gentleman an email, and I just suggest that the listeners do the same.
[01:41:38.618 --> 01:41:40.560]  What you think, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:56.278]  Well, you need to send him documents, concentration camp documents, all the documents I covered in that 55-minute analysis I did with just all the proof of the FEMA camps from the government, from the Army, direct sources, video of it, news articles, everything, so he doesn't sit up there and go, I'll tell you about the camps.
[01:41:56.418 --> 01:41:57.840]  He knows this is the biggest thing out there.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:06.444]  Well, I'm just saying that the listeners, to give him a good email barrage, I have his email address if you want it, and people, if they want to send something to him, let me know what you think.
[01:42:06.464 --> 01:42:06.925]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:42:26.819 --> 01:42:32.864]  His email address is me, just me, at glenbeck.com.
[01:42:34.205 --> 01:42:35.346]  Alright, anything else, sir?
[01:42:36.026 --> 01:42:53.259]  I'm just saying to the listeners, I didn't put anything crude or derogatory or whatever, I just stated what I thought, and that he needs to do a little more of his own accurate investigation before he goes out there and, you know, starts talking like he has been.
[01:42:53.909 --> 01:42:58.853]  And I'm just saying to the listeners to give him an email barrage and let him know that, you know, people are watching.
[01:42:58.893 --> 01:42:59.334]  That's all.
[01:42:59.814 --> 01:43:00.395]  Absolutely.
[01:43:00.415 --> 01:43:02.236]  Well, that's what he wants is the hype from this.
[01:43:02.276 --> 01:43:08.962]  The reason we're covering it, like when Lou Dobbs conservatively in a focused manner covers and tells the truth, we support him.
[01:43:09.002 --> 01:43:09.643]  It's amazing.
[01:43:11.364 --> 01:43:11.945]  You know, we're there.
[01:43:12.765 --> 01:43:16.509]  But when Glenn Beck, if you listen to him, he says maybe FEMA camps are good.
[01:43:17.009 --> 01:43:17.849]  I don't know if they're real.
[01:43:17.909 --> 01:43:18.830]  Ooh, conspiracy theories.
[01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:21.590]  He's making jokes about it while acting like he's against it.
[01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:24.851]  This is the guy that said put 9-11 traffickers in jail.
[01:43:25.131 --> 01:43:26.832]  This is the guy that said use the army against us.
[01:43:26.852 --> 01:43:27.772]  We're a bunch of McVeys.
[01:43:27.992 --> 01:43:30.133]  This is the guy that says he's worried about Bubba's and their guns.
[01:43:30.153 --> 01:43:31.773]  I mean, you can just watch it.
[01:43:31.833 --> 01:43:32.774]  It's doublespeak.
[01:43:32.814 --> 01:43:34.194]  My gosh, it's so obvious.
[01:43:35.145 --> 01:43:42.689]  Alex, before I send him off, a comment that I had, and like I said, it was nothing crude or anything, but just telling the gentleman to get his facts straight.
[01:43:42.929 --> 01:43:44.230]  No, no, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:54.114]  It's just for anybody with his resources, with a radio-producing crew, and a Fox News crew, saying he's looking into it, he doesn't know if it's true or not, or maybe it is, or maybe it's a good thing.
[01:43:54.455 --> 01:43:57.436]  I mean, come on, we know this is a long-term plan, we've laid out all the evidence.
[01:43:58.076 --> 01:44:01.858]  Let's talk to Evie, or Eve, in Illinois.
[01:44:01.878 --> 01:44:02.759]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:44:03.923 --> 01:44:04.764]  Hi, Glenn.
[01:44:04.884 --> 01:44:06.665]  I've only been listening to you for about a week.
[01:44:06.725 --> 01:44:07.425]  This is going bad.
[01:44:07.445 --> 01:44:07.986]  Sorry, Glenn.
[01:44:08.146 --> 01:44:09.347]  We were just talking about Glenn.
[01:44:09.367 --> 01:44:09.947]  Sorry, Alex.
[01:44:10.127 --> 01:44:10.547]  No, it's okay.
[01:44:10.567 --> 01:44:10.928]  Go ahead.
[01:44:10.988 --> 01:44:11.728]  I'm a little nervous.
[01:44:12.068 --> 01:44:14.730]  I'm a police officer, and my husband's a police officer.
[01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:20.574]  I've only been listening to you for about a week, but my mom and dad have listened to your show, and they've been talking to us about it.
[01:44:21.294 --> 01:44:29.780]  And my husband just recently was offered an opportunity to join a group called the Mobile Field Force.
[01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:30.800]  What it is is a
[01:44:32.344 --> 01:44:41.609]  Every department in Illinois is sectioned off into like North, South, East, and West, and they pick so many officers from that department to go and train two and three times a month.
[01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:46.212]  Now, I find it a little odd because they really don't know exactly what they're training for.
[01:44:46.232 --> 01:44:53.997]  They try to play it off like it's after what happened in Louisiana when a, you know, crisis comes up or a natural disaster.
[01:44:54.017 --> 01:44:55.517]  They want to be able to have these officers.
[01:44:55.758 --> 01:44:58.099]  Yeah, we've had a ma'am, officer, officer stay there.
[01:44:58.119 --> 01:44:59.580]  I mean, I hear your radios beeping.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:01.361]  Do you need to take that real fast and we'll come back to you?
[01:45:01.966 --> 01:45:04.248]  No, I'm good.
[01:45:04.748 --> 01:45:07.751]  We share with another department, so that was just another department talking.
[01:45:08.251 --> 01:45:15.777]  But they train, and from what my husband tells me, the training that they do is very militaristic, you know, in scope.
[01:45:15.917 --> 01:45:26.385]  And I just, he's a little, you know, I don't know if I believe all that, but I know you're talking, too, that you think that there's going to be another terror attack, and it's probably going to be, you know, in the schools or in a mall.
[01:45:26.565 --> 01:45:28.947]  And I also work part-time at a high school as a security guard.
[01:45:29.708 --> 01:45:38.796]  And after Columbine, I thought for sure we would do a lot of drills and things like that just to make sure we're kind of up to snuff in our security and we've done nothing until the last year and a half.
[01:45:39.318 --> 01:45:46.363]  And we've started intensifying and doing all these drills, and doing all these scenarios, and I just find it a little odd.
[01:45:46.884 --> 01:45:47.684]  Officer, let me tell you.
[01:45:48.485 --> 01:45:53.949]  Go to YouTube, go to Google, watch Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:45:54.289 --> 01:45:56.251]  You will witness troops trying to take our guns.
[01:45:56.731 --> 01:46:00.294]  Earlier in the show, in the second hour, I spent
[01:46:01.741 --> 01:46:04.882]  Almost all the segments, 50 minutes, going over all the documentation.
[01:46:04.922 --> 01:46:06.022]  There are real camps.
[01:46:06.462 --> 01:46:07.623]  People are already in them.
[01:46:08.203 --> 01:46:09.143]  They take police.
[01:46:09.703 --> 01:46:11.604]  You're really under federal control.
[01:46:11.984 --> 01:46:13.745]  The training's reasonable at first.
[01:46:14.105 --> 01:46:15.405]  You know, chemical or bio attack.
[01:46:15.485 --> 01:46:20.566]  And then the next training is door-to-door gun confiscation, cordoning neighborhoods.
[01:46:20.987 --> 01:46:22.247]  Then you'll be training with the military.
[01:46:22.267 --> 01:46:23.607]  They're watching your husband.
[01:46:23.907 --> 01:46:25.428]  They're studying if he goes along with it.
[01:46:25.448 --> 01:46:26.748]  They're studying if he understands.
[01:46:27.088 --> 01:46:28.669]  They're sifting through the police.
[01:46:29.249 --> 01:46:32.330]  To find these devilish jackboot cadres.
[01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:40.894]  The Illinois governor announced four months ago, Blagojevich, former governor, on the news they were going to use the National Guard in neighborhood gun sweeps.
[01:46:41.134 --> 01:46:44.616]  They're doing drills everywhere where the military comes and says, let us search your neighborhood for guns.
[01:46:44.956 --> 01:46:45.796]  It's just a drill.
[01:46:46.296 --> 01:46:48.737]  Northcom has announced they're going to use the military against the people.
[01:46:49.117 --> 01:46:49.818]  So, yes.
[01:46:50.698 --> 01:46:54.941]  Yes, and I'm aware of those teams, the Mobile Field Forces, everywhere.
[01:46:55.581 --> 01:46:58.483]  They have these federally funded positions in the departments.
[01:46:59.004 --> 01:47:00.084]  That's what this is.
[01:47:00.464 --> 01:47:07.489]  We've had emergency managers from Indiana and other places on, where they are gearing up for mass graves, for martial law.
[01:47:07.549 --> 01:47:14.794]  So, specifically, any other points you've got, or what is the training like that he's a little concerned about?
[01:47:16.769 --> 01:47:37.020]  The exercises we had to do, and I actually got to go do it with them, was we had to, like there was a biological attack, and we had to escort a truck to the area in Joliet, and we had to get these antidotes only enough for our department and our departmental family members.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:45.205]  We had to provide guard duty for the truck as it came to town in case it was ambushed by people, you know, obviously that wanted the antidote for their families, and I just
[01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:49.181]  I really am to the point to where I don't want to be an officer anymore.
[01:47:49.221 --> 01:47:52.883]  I've been an officer for 12 years, my husband 15, my dad's a retired officer.
[01:47:52.903 --> 01:47:58.826]  I just, you know, part of me wants to stay in and try to, you know, kind of keep my head in the door.
[01:47:58.866 --> 01:48:00.067]  No, no, I think it's good.
[01:48:00.167 --> 01:48:03.428]  I think it's good, but in the time we have, listen to me very carefully officer.
[01:48:04.849 --> 01:48:08.011]  You notice I told you your first training would be biological weapons release, correct?
[01:48:08.672 --> 01:48:09.573]  Yes, and that's what it was.
[01:48:09.853 --> 01:48:11.054]  Okay, now let me explain something.
[01:48:11.594 --> 01:48:17.639]  Did you hear five years ago when they said all the police and first responders had to take the smallpox shot and they refused?
[01:48:17.699 --> 01:48:19.180]  I'm sure you remember that or heard about that.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:19.841]  Yes.
[01:48:20.281 --> 01:48:22.182]  How do they make you want it now?
[01:48:22.823 --> 01:48:30.929]  If you're doing dog training, and humans are very similar to dogs, the New World Order brags in manuals that they train us like dogs, you act like you don't want the dog to have the chew toy.
[01:48:33.551 --> 01:48:35.032]  You want it to come after the chew toy.
[01:48:36.053 --> 01:48:37.154]  The chew toy is really poison.
[01:48:38.286 --> 01:48:45.651]  So, all over they have them practice guarding these shots, and you watch this will happen with your husband, like it's some gold.
[01:48:45.871 --> 01:48:58.519]  That's to condition him to want to take the shots, and to think of it as precious and wonderful, because they have to make the first responders take the forced inoculations first, so they will then force it on the public.
[01:48:58.539 --> 01:49:00.701]  And this has come out, we beat this five years ago.
[01:49:01.321 --> 01:49:19.524]  So, then the next training down the road, or maybe three layers in, will be going and putting people on trucks and buses to take them to a sports stadium, and they will have the role players, generally played by their officers in the first phase, saying, I want that shot, and practicing attacking police because they want the shot.
[01:49:19.744 --> 01:49:27.846]  Now, in reality, the public's not going to want the shot, and then that way the officers feel like it's a shot they want, it's a shot the public's going to want, this is something precious.
[01:49:28.726 --> 01:49:29.326]  You understand?
[01:49:29.566 --> 01:49:31.687]  So this is psych warfare conditioning.
[01:49:31.707 --> 01:49:33.248]  Do you like being manipulated like that?
[01:49:33.288 --> 01:49:36.249]  Because they think you're stupid, and I don't think you're stupid.
[01:49:36.849 --> 01:49:37.469]  No, no.
[01:49:37.809 --> 01:49:41.351]  My dad, he's been telling me the same things that you've been saying.
[01:49:41.791 --> 01:49:49.754]  Because he's a Vietnam veteran, and he goes to the VA clinic and suffers insurance, and he's like, I won't take any shots that they try to give me.
[01:49:50.365 --> 01:49:54.291]  I refuse them, I don't want them, because he thinks, you know, that there's something in which there isn't.
[01:49:54.311 --> 01:49:54.711]  Officer!
[01:49:54.851 --> 01:49:55.492]  Officer!
[01:49:55.833 --> 01:49:58.196]  Google cancer viruses and vaccines.
[01:49:58.236 --> 01:49:59.438]  You'll be mainstream news.
[01:50:00.299 --> 01:50:03.784]  Over 200 million Americans were injected with SV40 and they still put it in there.
[01:50:04.404 --> 01:50:04.525]  SV40!
[01:50:06.371 --> 01:50:07.032]  It's deadly!
[01:50:07.192 --> 01:50:08.673]  Most cancer is viral.
[01:50:08.693 --> 01:50:10.214]  They discovered this over a hundred years ago.
[01:50:10.234 --> 01:50:13.037]  I've had top scientists on, mainline doctors.
[01:50:13.597 --> 01:50:14.918]  They found out it's viral.
[01:50:14.958 --> 01:50:22.845]  They implant all of us with time-delayed DNA recombinant cancer viruses that activate around retirement.
[01:50:24.346 --> 01:50:25.987]  Because they don't want to pay you socials.
[01:50:26.027 --> 01:50:26.988]  Ma'am, it's eugenics.
[01:50:27.388 --> 01:50:27.949]  Please look.
[01:50:28.209 --> 01:50:28.770]  Have you heard about it?
[01:50:28.810 --> 01:50:29.330]  Oh, I believe you.
[01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:30.791]  I totally believe you.
[01:50:31.432 --> 01:50:35.335]  I'm trying to wake other officers up to this, you know, and let them know that
[01:50:35.737 --> 01:50:36.778]  That's what's going on.
[01:50:36.818 --> 01:50:40.143]  You know, they are, like you said, are just lulled into this dream state.
[01:50:40.911 --> 01:50:42.112]  Oh, we're the good guys.
[01:50:42.132 --> 01:50:48.116]  We're fighting the bad guys, but I try to let them know I think they're going to try to make us be the bad guys, and I'm not going to go along with that.
[01:50:48.536 --> 01:50:51.358]  I'll die before I go in and I try to take another citizen from going.
[01:50:51.598 --> 01:50:52.299]  I'm not going to do it.
[01:50:52.359 --> 01:50:53.419]  You know, this is incredible.
[01:50:53.439 --> 01:50:56.481]  We got Lindsey Williams, but I'm just going to have to come back to you.
[01:50:56.922 --> 01:50:58.103]  Can we come back to you for a second?
[01:50:58.263 --> 01:50:58.923]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:50:59.343 --> 01:50:59.944]  Alright, good.
[01:51:00.124 --> 01:51:01.705]  Folks, police, don't laugh at me.
[01:51:01.905 --> 01:51:03.306]  They're injecting us all with cancer.
[01:51:03.726 --> 01:51:06.068]  Please, check it out for your own family and your own sake.
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.622]  Is your credit card debt out of control?
[01:51:09.802 --> 01:51:12.284]  Are you in over your head dealing with monthly payments?
[01:51:12.584 --> 01:51:16.126]  There's a powerful secret the credit card companies don't want you to know.
[01:51:16.407 --> 01:51:23.332]  If you have credit card debt, you have the power to settle that debt for a fraction of what you owe, cutting your payments by up to half or more.
[01:51:23.532 --> 01:51:34.260]  That's bad news for credit card companies, but it's great news for you, and we'd like to offer you free information that will show you how to settle your credit card debt and lower your payments by up to half or more.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:36.101]  It's yours free when you call
[01:51:36.101 --> 01:51:36.602]  Call today.
[01:51:36.902 --> 01:51:38.164]  Don't declare bankruptcy.
[01:51:38.444 --> 01:51:40.908]  Give us 10 minutes and we could save you thousands.
[01:51:41.288 --> 01:51:41.869]  Live better.

[01:51:51.863 --> 01:51:55.884]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:51:55.904 --> 01:51:57.525]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:52:16.966 --> 01:52:17.986]  But who is the enemy?
[01:52:18.507 --> 01:52:19.007]  Bin Laden.
[01:52:19.307 --> 01:52:20.288]  This is his M.O.
[01:52:20.308 --> 01:52:21.588]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:23.369]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:52:23.649 --> 01:52:30.412]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:52:30.812 --> 01:52:31.252]  Some U.S.
[01:52:31.292 --> 01:52:36.975]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:52:37.635 --> 01:52:41.096]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:52:41.116 --> 01:52:43.296]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:53:08.027 --> 01:53:15.671]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[01:53:16.112 --> 01:53:17.272]  You need the Paclite!
[01:53:17.713 --> 01:53:25.557]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[01:53:25.937 --> 01:53:29.099]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[01:53:29.499 --> 01:53:33.942]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[01:53:34.322 --> 01:53:36.203]  The Paclite is so durable, soldiers
[01:53:36.263 --> 01:53:36.543]  I think so.
[01:53:55.909 --> 01:53:57.430]  Or call us today at 877-715-4448.
[01:53:57.450 --> 01:53:57.650]  That's 877-715-4448.
[01:53:57.670 --> 01:54:00.992]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:17.662 --> 01:54:18.723]  Listen to me, folks.
[01:54:19.304 --> 01:54:23.248]  I know it's hard to believe they put cancer viruses in the vaccines and mercury.
[01:54:23.608 --> 01:54:24.749]  It's on record they do.
[01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:26.651]  All you've got to do is Google it.
[01:54:26.711 --> 01:54:28.513]  Mainstream news, government documents.
[01:54:28.553 --> 01:54:30.295]  They've caught the UN sterilizing women.
[01:54:31.036 --> 01:54:32.077]  That's mainstream news.
[01:54:32.257 --> 01:54:35.260]  Adding a key pathogen that combines with the tetanus shot.
[01:54:36.201 --> 01:54:41.586]  For an autoimmune response that destroys the key sexual organs and their fertility.
[01:54:42.407 --> 01:54:43.147]  It's eugenics.
[01:54:43.327 --> 01:54:44.428]  Everything is eugenics.
[01:54:44.508 --> 01:54:46.150]  Hitler got his ideas from the U.S.
[01:54:46.210 --> 01:54:46.630]  and England.
[01:54:46.650 --> 01:54:49.233]  The scientific community basically all believe this.
[01:54:49.653 --> 01:54:50.834]  My film Endgame covers it.
[01:54:51.815 --> 01:54:54.077]  I had to get past my fear when I read these documents.
[01:54:54.157 --> 01:54:55.338]  I mean, it is bracing.
[01:54:55.418 --> 01:54:56.199]  It is shaking.
[01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:08.434]  There have been times years ago, I don't really do it anymore, where I would just sit down in the night and couldn't even cry, but tears would just, you know, like I wasn't retching, but tears would just start pouring out.
[01:55:08.534 --> 01:55:10.657]  I mean, it is, and I have to face them.
[01:55:10.838 --> 01:55:12.200]  I have to go up against these people.
[01:55:13.337 --> 01:55:18.701]  I know they've killed so many, set so many up, because we can't let them keep doing this.
[01:55:19.461 --> 01:55:19.942]  It's real.
[01:55:19.982 --> 01:55:23.504]  Lindsey Williams is coming up in five minutes, he'll be with us for 45 minutes, and I have a state rep popping in for 10.
[01:55:23.624 --> 01:55:26.967]  And I'm going to get Lindsey back on again very, very soon.
[01:55:27.347 --> 01:55:28.608]  We appreciate Lindsey Williams being there.
[01:55:28.648 --> 01:55:31.450]  Everything he's been saying has been proven to be documented in triplicate.
[01:55:31.850 --> 01:55:34.452]  But, officer, is it an Evie or an Eve?
[01:55:35.911 --> 01:55:48.521]  Evie, anything else as an officer in Illinois that, I mean, you're concerned, you're trying to reach out to other officers, are you scared to?
[01:55:49.002 --> 01:55:49.522]  What's happening?
[01:55:50.283 --> 01:56:01.912]  Well, I mean, obviously I'm a little scared because, you know, they don't want you to, you know, be informed of what's going on, but yeah, I really just want officers to do like what you said, go on YouTube, you know, Google these things and look into it.
[01:56:01.952 --> 01:56:04.394]  I mean, like I've been telling my husband,
[01:56:04.741 --> 01:56:06.221]  You don't have to take anyone's word for it.
[01:56:06.261 --> 01:56:11.963]  You can see it on paper, you know, in print from the news that you rely on for all your other information, you know.
[01:56:12.123 --> 01:56:15.364]  And, you know, he's been looking into it.
[01:56:15.464 --> 01:56:17.265]  And, you know, I think he's coming around.
[01:56:17.305 --> 01:56:21.446]  I just think his problem is that he's wanted to be a police officer his whole life.
[01:56:21.546 --> 01:56:25.547]  And, you know, he's kind of, you know, disappointed and shocked and sad that it's going to come to this.
[01:56:25.987 --> 01:56:27.808]  And he's probably going to have to, you know, give it up.
[01:56:28.874 --> 01:56:32.496]  You know, on the other hand, we had two children, so that really comes before anything.
[01:56:32.976 --> 01:56:35.297]  And, you know, I want my freedom.
[01:56:35.317 --> 01:56:36.258]  What do you mean?
[01:56:36.378 --> 01:56:40.240]  I'm from the South, and you know, I think that everyone should be able to carry a gun.
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:43.261]  I believe in concealed carry, and I support it.
[01:56:43.341 --> 01:56:44.542]  I'm an officer, and I support it.
[01:56:45.142 --> 01:56:46.223]  I totally agree.
[01:56:46.243 --> 01:56:48.784]  If you talk about Chicago, look at what goes on there.
[01:56:48.864 --> 01:56:54.467]  I mean, I have a lot of officers that are friends that are in Chicago that are officers, and they think, you know,
[01:56:55.026 --> 01:56:59.389]  These people knew that the citizen that they were coming on to try to do something to might be armed.
[01:56:59.529 --> 01:57:00.950]  Maybe they might stop and not do it.
[01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:03.752]  Or, you know, maybe they think twice about it or get blown away.
[01:57:03.852 --> 01:57:09.797]  Well, Evie, they've done polls of officers nationwide and upwards of 97% are pro-Second Amendment.
[01:57:09.817 --> 01:57:10.477]  They're good people.
[01:57:11.198 --> 01:57:13.920]  But it's the police chiefs that are bought and paid for by the globalists now.
[01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:18.412]  This is another example of what I'm talking about, a microcosm of it.
[01:57:18.992 --> 01:57:20.493]  That's why they train the troops.
[01:57:20.593 --> 01:57:22.914]  Oh, the Army's here to help at checkpoints to stop drunks.
[01:57:22.934 --> 01:57:24.475]  Well, that's reasonable to stop drunks.
[01:57:24.795 --> 01:57:27.056]  Then the precedent's set that it's for gun confiscation.
[01:57:27.597 --> 01:57:30.738]  All of this, officers need to recognize how they're being manipulated.
[01:57:30.758 --> 01:57:31.679]  They need to recognize
[01:57:32.279 --> 01:57:36.525]  And understand, we made films, you know, a decade ago, twelve years ago, documenting what would now happen.
[01:57:36.785 --> 01:57:43.815]  That we're not making this up, we're taking incredible risk to tell you this, but it's a greater risk not to fight it, and not to go up against it.
[01:57:44.415 --> 01:57:45.557]  Had you ever tried to call in before?
[01:57:45.577 --> 01:57:45.617]  No.
[01:57:46.438 --> 01:57:48.401]  No, this is the first time I've tried to call.
[01:57:50.271 --> 01:57:54.917]  Yeah, well usually I have all these police and military that email me saying they can never get through.
[01:57:55.237 --> 01:57:56.179]  I'm glad you got through.
[01:57:56.199 --> 01:58:03.147]  We're going to start having some days where only police and military can call in so they can get in and give us the intel and tell us what they're seeing and what's happening.
[01:58:03.348 --> 01:58:07.212]  I don't think, it's his decision, that your husband needs to leave the force.
[01:58:07.933 --> 01:58:13.837]  He needs to, within the law, within the Constitution, read that, follow that, and start speaking out against it.
[01:58:14.117 --> 01:58:18.100]  You know, start talking about it, or covertly, you know, expose what's happening.
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:28.647]  He can choose the way... I mean, see, as good people find out about the evil, they all leave the military and police, and they hire the illegal aliens, the felons, you know, the foreigners, to fill up the ranks, so...
[01:58:29.227 --> 01:58:32.428]  It's a catch-22, but you don't need to leave.
[01:58:32.448 --> 01:58:34.209]  I mean, you're on the ground.
[01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:36.730]  You know better than I. You just need to gauge what's happening.
[01:58:36.770 --> 01:58:37.450]  God bless you.
[01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:38.891]  Good to have you on with us, Evie, okay?
[01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:39.851]  Thank you for my call.
[01:58:39.871 --> 01:58:40.492]  I appreciate it.
[01:58:40.912 --> 01:58:41.432]  God bless you.
[01:58:41.452 --> 01:58:41.752]  Take care.
[01:58:41.792 --> 01:58:44.873]  That's a good peace officer, a guardian of the people.
[01:58:48.935 --> 01:58:52.296]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:52.336 --> 01:58:54.117]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:57.329 --> 01:58:58.890]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:59.010 --> 01:59:03.632]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:59:03.752 --> 01:59:06.513]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:06.733 --> 01:59:09.574]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:09.754 --> 01:59:15.657]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:15.857 --> 01:59:18.798]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:19.098 --> 01:59:25.961]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:26.161 --> 01:59:26.601]  We're good to go!
[02:00:00.129 --> 02:00:02.031]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:00:02.512 --> 02:00:05.295]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:22.418 --> 02:00:26.583]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are here back live in the next 45 minutes.
[02:00:26.603 --> 02:00:27.384]  Lindsey Williams joins us.
[02:00:27.404 --> 02:00:30.928]  We have a state rep popping in, an understate declaring sovereignty, that's going to be joining us.
[02:00:31.228 --> 02:00:34.772]  George Soros at the World Economic Forum a few weeks ago.
[02:00:34.792 --> 02:00:35.794]  The video just surfaced.
[02:00:35.854 --> 02:00:37.075]  It was on international television.
[02:00:37.095 --> 02:00:38.397]  We just found it last week.
[02:00:39.858 --> 02:00:47.083]  He says, yes, we're staging the, you know, oil implosion price to bring down Venezuela, bring down Russia, bring down the Arabs.
[02:00:47.463 --> 02:00:50.085]  They're also imploding the markets so they can consolidate it.
[02:00:50.545 --> 02:01:00.992]  Everything that we separately had from our infiltration of Bilderberg in 2006, laying on everything that was going to happen, integrates with his oil company executive he worked with for many years, telling him about this.
[02:01:01.412 --> 02:01:03.874]  He predicted when fuel was at $148, $149 a barrel, it would drop below $50.
[02:01:03.974 --> 02:01:04.975]  It's gone as low as $33 a barrel.
[02:01:05.015 --> 02:01:05.535]  It's at about $40 right now.
[02:01:10.078 --> 02:01:13.599]  Again, to bankrupt all these oil-rich nations and bring in a worldwide depression.
[02:01:14.399 --> 02:01:18.760]  Lindsey Williams, it is a great honor to have you back on with us, and we appreciate you spending time with us today.
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:22.840]  Thank you, Alex, so much for letting me be with you today for an update.
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:36.683]  You know, even though I lived with the elite of the world for three years' time, I still sit back, utterly dumbfounded and amazed how these people have the power to do exactly what they're going to do, say they're going to do, and do it.
[02:01:37.848 --> 02:01:41.091]  And do it meticulously, exactly like they said they were going to.
[02:01:43.713 --> 02:01:47.556]  And, you know, Missouri is the show-me state, or put-up-and-shut-up.
[02:01:47.637 --> 02:02:00.468]  Everything you've told us over the years has all turned out exactly as you said, because you wrote a book twenty-something years ago, you work with these people, you still know them, just like we can infiltrate Bilderberg and find out exactly what's going to happen, because the globalists rule
[02:02:01.596 --> 02:02:03.377]  And they're bringing us into a worldwide depression.
[02:02:03.437 --> 02:02:07.979]  Recap what he told you, then let's get into why would Soros come out and admit everything you said.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:11.501]  Well, approximately seven months ago, I had a phone call.
[02:02:11.922 --> 02:02:17.905]  The phone call was for the purpose of telling me, you've said too much, either be quiet or we're going to take action.
[02:02:18.105 --> 02:02:21.767]  And the action that they gave me and the choice they gave me wasn't too pleasant.
[02:02:22.347 --> 02:02:27.610]  So I agreed with what he said, pulled my website, withdrew my DVD,
[02:02:28.277 --> 02:02:30.818]  Change everything around, but that's not the important part.
[02:02:30.838 --> 02:02:32.438]  The important part was after that.
[02:02:32.578 --> 02:02:34.418]  I have not seen this man for 25 years.
[02:02:34.538 --> 02:02:35.279]  I know who he is.
[02:02:35.339 --> 02:02:36.779]  He's 82 years of age now.
[02:02:37.279 --> 02:02:41.640]  He knows everything that the elite are doing and everything that goes on behind closed doors.
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:43.781]  So I decided to be friendly.
[02:02:43.921 --> 02:02:47.141]  I asked him how your family, how you've been doing, where you've been living.
[02:02:47.161 --> 02:02:53.523]  Uh, he, he, he really, I was amazed how kind and nice he became all of a sudden.
[02:02:54.036 --> 02:03:01.958]  And for the next 45 minutes time, he told me everything that the elite plan to do on the face of the earth over the next year to a year and a half.
[02:03:02.018 --> 02:03:12.020]  And at that time, crude oil was $147 a barrel, and nobody would have ever, in the foggiest imagination, would have guessed that it was going to $50 a barrel.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:16.161]  Oh, definitely not to $33 a barrel, which has been its low.
[02:03:16.441 --> 02:03:19.581]  He said, crude oil's going to $250 a barrel.
[02:03:19.921 --> 02:03:21.022]  I was dumbfounded.
[02:03:21.082 --> 02:03:22.622]  Immediately, I asked him, I said,
[02:03:23.098 --> 02:03:24.259]  Why are you doing this?
[02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:27.222]  He was as bold as the day was long ago.
[02:03:27.863 --> 02:03:36.050]  There again, Alex, nobody would have guessed that the OPEC oil producing countries of the world would have ever gone bankrupt.
[02:03:36.250 --> 02:03:38.012]  I mean, this was unthinkable.
[02:03:38.853 --> 02:03:39.534]  But it has.
[02:03:39.834 --> 02:03:45.319]  They are on the verge of bankruptcy right now, and they say that unless they can get crude oil back up to above $80 a barrel,
[02:03:46.653 --> 02:03:48.833]  That they're going to have major financial problems.
[02:03:48.853 --> 02:03:51.734]  They've stopped buying our T-Bills, our Treasury Bills.
[02:03:51.834 --> 02:03:54.495]  As a result, the dollar is in drastic trouble.
[02:03:54.955 --> 02:03:57.375]  The average American has not the slightest idea.
[02:03:57.655 --> 02:04:03.697]  Well, then he went on to say that the price of gasoline is going to $1.50 to $2 a gallon gas pump.
[02:04:04.017 --> 02:04:06.237]  But then, he said it's going to stay there.
[02:04:06.357 --> 02:04:09.578]  And I gathered a year to a year and a half to keep it there.
[02:04:10.037 --> 02:04:12.078]  In order to accomplish what they want to accomplish.
[02:04:12.118 --> 02:04:13.118]  Now, let me show you.
[02:04:13.138 --> 02:04:14.438]  I'm going to begin if I may.
[02:04:14.778 --> 02:04:18.700]  I'll make this update as fast as I can because we've only got 45 minutes.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:20.420]  So forgive me if I talk fast.
[02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:24.581]  But there's so much happened since I was with you a week, a week and a half ago, Alex.
[02:04:25.081 --> 02:04:26.862]  Until I'm going to get in everything I can.
[02:04:26.922 --> 02:04:29.503]  And thank you so much for letting me be with you.
[02:04:29.883 --> 02:04:33.964]  And the last few moments, I'm going to give what's happening to the farmers of America.
[02:04:34.358 --> 02:04:37.360]  And if nothing else bothers you, this one's going to wake you up.
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:40.403]  So you better have your pencil and paper handy, because here we go.
[02:04:50.530 --> 02:04:54.533]  ...at the public Bilderberg Group meeting, the Davos Switzerland World Economic Forum.
[02:04:54.853 --> 02:04:56.154]  He's Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[02:04:56.514 --> 02:05:07.241]  This is inside Bilderberg Group, New World Order level intelligence, directly laying out the future with 100% precision accuracy.
[02:05:08.061 --> 02:05:08.921]  Detoxify.
[02:05:08.981 --> 02:05:13.462]  You are constantly reminded how important Detoxify is to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[02:05:13.602 --> 02:05:19.364]  You are also being reminded that it's important to Detoxify safely and not all products will provide safe and effective results.
[02:05:19.584 --> 02:05:23.365]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body with safe and effective Qilormax.
[02:05:23.485 --> 02:05:28.446]  With the help of Nutriodine, Qilormax will help your body to remove heavy metals, toxins and chemicals.
[02:05:28.626 --> 02:05:34.168]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins and fluoride, bromine and chloride.
[02:05:34.308 --> 02:05:38.250]  Add Malignablock to stimulate these two detox and anti-cancer protection.
[02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:42.892]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membranes.
[02:05:43.112 --> 02:05:49.635]  And Nutra-Trala to recycle all fat and water-soluble antioxidant cellular protection enzymes and molecules.
[02:05:49.775 --> 02:05:51.996]  Keeler Max and Dr. Bill's Oral Detox.
[02:05:52.256 --> 02:05:55.599]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:05:55.619 --> 02:05:57.060]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:06:17.136 --> 02:06:18.177]  But who is the enemy?
[02:06:18.678 --> 02:06:19.198]  Bin Laden.
[02:06:19.478 --> 02:06:20.359]  This is his M.O.
[02:06:20.379 --> 02:06:21.821]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:06:21.841 --> 02:06:23.523]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:06:23.843 --> 02:06:30.610]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.451]  Some U.S.
[02:06:31.491 --> 02:06:37.137]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:06:37.817 --> 02:06:41.278]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:06:41.298 --> 02:06:43.479]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:07:07.717 --> 02:07:10.338]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[02:07:10.938 --> 02:07:13.898]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[02:07:14.258 --> 02:07:17.679]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[02:07:18.039 --> 02:07:24.220]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:29.662]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[02:07:29.842 --> 02:07:36.543]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.

[02:08:08.401 --> 02:08:12.625]  It's a sudden reversal of fortunes for the oil producing countries.
[02:08:13.405 --> 02:08:21.371]  In the Gulf States you have quite a few bubbles popping.
[02:08:22.212 --> 02:08:29.918]  Dubai was probably the biggest real estate bubble in the world and it's now bursting.
[02:08:31.619 --> 02:08:39.425]  It's not all bad news because the major oil producing countries have been the enemies of the prevailing world order.
[02:08:39.545 --> 02:08:42.607]  Venezuela, Iran, Russia.
[02:08:43.528 --> 02:08:50.253]  And it's not so easy to finance a Bolivarian revolution with $40 oil.
[02:08:50.693 --> 02:08:55.797]  So I think Venezuela, Chavez, probably his days are numbered.
[02:08:56.458 --> 02:09:00.601]  And in Iran, I think that he's not going to last a year.
[02:09:02.583 --> 02:09:08.028]  Maybe wrong but I mean he's under considerable duress and his influence is going to decline.
[02:09:08.048 --> 02:09:17.197]  In Iran, Ahmadinejad is up for elections in 2009 and unless he can provoke some
[02:09:18.408 --> 02:09:27.075]  I think that he's liable to also be defeated and you may have a more reasonable regime.
[02:09:27.395 --> 02:09:28.055]  What about Russia?
[02:09:28.636 --> 02:09:37.703]  Now Russia is more troubling because there, you see, Putin
[02:09:38.363 --> 02:09:57.257]  has been using oil for a number of reasons to re-establish Russia's geopolitical influence, to enrich the rulers, to maintain themselves in power, and to bribe the rulers of the neighboring countries to gain control over their gas.
[02:09:58.158 --> 02:10:03.262]  But through the success, he was very popular.
[02:10:04.861 --> 02:10:07.823]  And not so easy now.
[02:10:08.423 --> 02:10:18.047]  Now, suddenly you have financial collapse, inflation, ruble falling, living standards falling.
[02:10:19.022 --> 02:10:34.036]  And there's a danger that he will be more adventurous, trying to have some foreign adventure, Ukraine, whatever, to divert attention.
[02:10:34.096 --> 02:10:35.257]  I'm afraid we have to end it there.
[02:10:35.437 --> 02:10:36.898]  George Soros, I'd like to thank you very much.
[02:10:36.938 --> 02:10:38.780]  We didn't get to China, but we heard lots about Russia.
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:39.641]  That is George Soros.
[02:10:42.182 --> 02:10:55.595]  Now remember, Lindsey Williams, months before they snuck attack Russian-controlled territory in Georgia, held since the early 90s, historically part of Russia, he said they're also going to start stuff with Russia.
[02:10:55.895 --> 02:10:57.137]  No one was even talking about that.
[02:10:57.157 --> 02:10:59.759]  That just came out of the clear blue one morning, but Lindsey was right.
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:03.983]  I played that Lindsey Williams because I wanted to, you know,
[02:11:05.106 --> 02:11:14.549]  Have you been able to comment, before we get into the latest developments, on why do you think the elite are now basically admitting everything that you were saying, but you said it before it was even announced, or it even happened?
[02:11:15.509 --> 02:11:18.430]  Well, Alex, you have to understand, I'm just an ordinary, everyday guy.
[02:11:18.450 --> 02:11:21.071]  I put on my britches just like every other man every morning.
[02:11:21.471 --> 02:11:27.933]  But, by the providence of God, numbers of years ago, I had the privilege of living with the elite of the world for three years.
[02:11:28.033 --> 02:11:30.534]  As a result, I've kept in touch with some of them, and
[02:11:31.024 --> 02:11:35.906]  They have kept in touch with me sometimes over these past 35 years.
[02:11:36.606 --> 02:11:38.187]  They knew in advance.
[02:11:38.327 --> 02:11:40.528]  Alex, folks, I plead with you.
[02:11:40.728 --> 02:11:49.952]  Everybody out in this audience today, I beg of you, please listen and believe every word Alex Jones is saying.
[02:11:50.052 --> 02:11:52.033]  He has tried to tell you for years.
[02:11:52.543 --> 02:12:09.588]  That there is a group of elite, and let me say as emphatically as I humanly possibly can, there positively is a group of people on the face of this earth who control the world, and they knew a year to two years ago everything that's taking place in the financial world right now.
[02:12:09.948 --> 02:12:12.849]  They knew they were going to take the price of crude oil from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel,
[02:12:15.572 --> 02:12:17.172]  It was all planned in advance.
[02:12:17.292 --> 02:12:21.233]  This is not something that just happened out of a clear blue sky.
[02:12:21.573 --> 02:12:35.936]  I don't know whether George Soros knew it back then or not, but I know that seven months ago I was told it by one of these individuals who knows everything that goes on behind closed doors, so let me show you exactly what has happened in the past seven days.
[02:12:36.356 --> 02:12:37.557]  Seven to nine days, maybe.
[02:12:37.917 --> 02:12:39.337]  Okay, first of all, Dubai.
[02:12:39.737 --> 02:12:42.738]  Last weekend, George Soros just mentioned that.
[02:12:42.778 --> 02:12:44.338]  I'm so glad you played that, Alex.
[02:12:44.418 --> 02:12:44.718]  Thank you.
[02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:59.380]  Last weekend, Dubai, of all things, one of the OPEC oil-producing countries of the world, building that beautiful five-star city, Dubai, borrowed last weekend $10 billion on five-year unsecured bonds.
[02:13:00.621 --> 02:13:05.024]  And they say that within another week's time, they're going to have to borrow another $10 billion.
[02:13:05.044 --> 02:13:15.011]  They have canceled their concrete contract with an American company that was supplying the concrete for that beautiful five-star city and sitting on the airport parking lot
[02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:22.087]  In Dubai City, today, are approximately 3,000 abandoned automobiles.
[02:13:22.107 --> 02:13:22.707]  Why?
[02:13:23.248 --> 02:13:26.791]  You see, in Dubai, if you don't make your automobile payment, oh yes they did.
[02:13:26.871 --> 02:13:36.261]  These workers went from around the world to Dubai to make their fortune, building that beautiful five-star city that there's never been anything like it on the face of the earth.
[02:13:36.301 --> 02:13:39.524]  They bought Mercedes, they bought Rolls Royces,
[02:13:39.997 --> 02:13:45.860]  But in Dubai, if you don't make your automobile payment or your house payment, they don't just come and get the automobile at the house.
[02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:47.241]  They come and get you.
[02:13:47.821 --> 02:13:49.902]  And these people lost their jobs.
[02:13:50.042 --> 02:13:51.403]  Dubai has closed down.
[02:13:52.363 --> 02:13:54.164]  It has ground to a halt.
[02:13:54.625 --> 02:13:56.405]  The skyscrapers aren't being built.
[02:13:56.465 --> 02:13:58.046]  The concrete's not being delivered.
[02:13:58.086 --> 02:13:59.267]  They don't have any more money.
[02:13:59.307 --> 02:13:59.747]  They're out.
[02:13:59.787 --> 02:14:00.668]  They've had to borrow.
[02:14:01.148 --> 02:14:02.869]  All because they've lost 75% of their income
[02:14:05.606 --> 02:14:10.650]  On every barrel of oil, and they've done it within four months' time.
[02:14:10.670 --> 02:14:20.217]  Now, Lindsey, we covered that when you were on with us, because I want to get into the new developments and, you know, go back to what this elitist former oil company had told you the globalists were planning.
[02:14:20.257 --> 02:14:30.385]  It dovetails with our intel, because it's now, all of it is unfolding, and how you see this unfolding, how bad it's going to get, how bad he told you that it was going to get.
[02:14:30.405 --> 02:14:32.786]  But clearly, they get the world overextended in these debt bubbles.
[02:14:33.806 --> 02:14:38.750]  Then they blow out the oil, they blow out the stock market for a global consolidation so they can consolidate things.
[02:14:39.110 --> 02:14:40.291]  Is that not what you were told?
[02:14:41.132 --> 02:14:42.593]  Yes, that's exactly what he said.
[02:14:42.633 --> 02:14:47.997]  He said America will see a financial crisis that will be so great that it will take years to come out of it.
[02:14:48.097 --> 02:14:51.399]  He said that Russia was going to be made a great empire again.
[02:14:51.439 --> 02:14:53.481]  They'll have to break them first and control them.
[02:14:53.881 --> 02:14:57.584]  He also mentioned other countries of the world and what would happen to them.
[02:14:57.924 --> 02:15:00.206]  Let me point out what happened this past weekend.
[02:15:00.426 --> 02:15:02.447]  Latvia government collapsed.
[02:15:02.848 --> 02:15:03.108]  Yes!
[02:15:03.598 --> 02:15:07.099]  Yeah, Latvia doesn't have natural resources, so it became a financial center.
[02:15:07.619 --> 02:15:09.020]  It has totally collapsed.
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:15.282]  The Ukraine, if you went to the bank in the Ukraine, you live there, you could not pull money out.
[02:15:15.502 --> 02:15:18.703]  They will not allow anyone to take cash out of the bank into Ukraine.
[02:15:19.283 --> 02:15:21.564]  Iceland, as you remember, collapsed a while back.
[02:15:22.084 --> 02:15:28.347]  All of these, Hungary, Hungary's foreign fell to an all-time low on Monday.
[02:15:28.747 --> 02:15:32.428]  Poland's slavity slumped to the lowest in five years.
[02:15:32.850 --> 02:15:39.556]  This is a worldwide situation that they basically are going to bring in the control of the whole world.
[02:15:39.736 --> 02:15:46.302]  Eastern and Central Europe has been supported by Germany as of this past, what, two days ago.
[02:15:46.382 --> 02:15:49.705]  And by the way, they're now announcing world government and all the news is the same.
[02:15:49.725 --> 02:15:54.890]  You're ruled by banks and a new bank of the world that will pay carbon taxes to exactly what you said they were going to do.
[02:15:55.230 --> 02:15:57.913]  This is the foretold coming of the one world government.
[02:15:57.953 --> 02:15:59.294]  It is now happening.
[02:16:00.185 --> 02:16:04.348]  Yes, that's exactly what's happening, and now let's go to the United States of America.
[02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:05.749]  How is this affecting us?
[02:16:05.850 --> 02:16:21.402]  First of all, he said to me seven months ago, and Alex, you granted me the privilege of breaking this news on your show for the first time on July the 28th, and he said, America will see a financial collapse so great that it will take years to come out of it.
[02:16:21.462 --> 02:16:23.464]  Now let me point out what happened just this past week.
[02:16:23.504 --> 02:16:25.045]  Corporate profits report.
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:28.962]  On this Monday, Macy's profits were down 59%.
[02:16:29.683 --> 02:16:33.586]  Target, a lot of you do business there from time to time.
[02:16:33.606 --> 02:16:37.408]  41% down on profit report.
[02:16:37.508 --> 02:16:39.350]  JCPenney, 41%.
[02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:42.492]  Office Depot lost $1.5 billion.
[02:16:43.052 --> 02:16:49.997]  Imagine how this is going to affect the tax structure of the federal and state government within 60 to 90 days.
[02:16:50.117 --> 02:16:53.579]  And the crime rate's exploding and they're openly announcing they're getting ready for martial law.
[02:16:53.599 --> 02:16:54.140]  Please continue.
[02:16:55.011 --> 02:17:03.414]  Yes, AIG, largest insurance company in the world, I guess it is, reported the biggest quarterly loss ever in U.S.
[02:17:03.474 --> 02:17:04.515]  financial history.
[02:17:04.915 --> 02:17:07.336]  Close to $70 billion in one quarter.
[02:17:07.636 --> 02:17:09.497]  It's lost over $100 billion in the last year.
[02:17:10.317 --> 02:17:15.639]  Yes, we bailed them out to $120 billion, and now they are going back for another $60 billion.
[02:17:16.419 --> 02:17:19.160]  And let me put it this way, in 1975,
[02:17:21.494 --> 02:17:36.839]  A person could buy all of the real estate in America, all of the shopping malls in America, all of the hotels in America, all of the land in the United States of America could have been bought in 1975 before the government of the United States of America has spent in the past 90 days.
[02:17:36.859 --> 02:17:39.140]  I mean, folks, this is so startling.
[02:17:41.981 --> 02:17:44.262]  It shatters the thinking of a person almost.
[02:17:44.302 --> 02:17:47.303]  Citigroup has borrowed $40 billion from the U.S.
[02:17:47.343 --> 02:17:48.824]  Treasury, yet it's only worth $13 billion.
[02:17:49.850 --> 02:17:59.015]  You realize that your great-great-grandchildren are going to be responsible for this indebtedness of the outlandish things that are being done right now?
[02:17:59.335 --> 02:18:05.679]  A Saudi Arabian prince had invested hundreds of billions of dollars into Citibank.
[02:18:06.019 --> 02:18:07.100]  He's going broke!
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:10.642]  I mean, he literally is on the verge of wandering out.
[02:18:11.722 --> 02:18:18.626]  This man told me, he said, the oil-producing countries, OPEC, they are doing this for the purpose
[02:18:19.085 --> 02:18:26.211]  I'm bringing them to bankruptcy, and every bit of it is exactly what you've been saying all of these times, these years.
[02:18:27.132 --> 02:18:29.674]  Alex, it's coming to pass right before our eyes.
[02:18:31.475 --> 02:18:48.349]  And soon the riots and the martial law in the FEMA camps, unless we go completely wild, warning people as we watch them on the wall, I believe that if we expose this, at least here in the United States and a few other pockets, because we do have the Second Amendment, they may not bring in the full martial law here as they're doing all over the world right now.
[02:18:49.844 --> 02:18:53.527]  Well, let me come down to where we are.
[02:18:55.028 --> 02:18:58.690]  This past weekend, I'm going to give a place, I'm going to give a name.
[02:18:59.351 --> 02:19:02.073]  I have permission to do this.
[02:19:02.493 --> 02:19:03.514]  Campo, Colorado.
[02:19:04.294 --> 02:19:06.216]  Southeastern Colorado, Northern Texas.
[02:19:06.636 --> 02:19:10.339]  Forty percent of the food supply in the United States of America is grown right there.
[02:19:11.499 --> 02:19:12.640]  The couple is Betel Lock.
[02:19:13.161 --> 02:19:16.283]  She and her husband own a farm of thousands of acres.
[02:19:16.623 --> 02:19:19.345]  The largest farms in America are in that part of the country.
[02:19:19.898 --> 02:19:28.760]  Now folks, please, if anything else is said on this program today, this you must remember because it's going to affect whether you eat dinner or not.
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:33.361]  She said to me, Catherine Williams, we don't know what we're going to do.
[02:19:33.901 --> 02:19:36.962]  She said right now we're getting $3 a bushel for corn.
[02:19:37.822 --> 02:19:40.183]  She said we're ready to put in our crop and she can't do it.
[02:19:40.743 --> 02:19:42.764]  She said it cost us $5.50 to raise that corn this next year.
[02:19:47.108 --> 02:19:47.548]  Stay there.
[02:19:47.568 --> 02:19:50.911]  We're going to talk about how they destroyed the commodities market by design to bankrupt everything.
[02:19:50.971 --> 02:19:59.438]  This is the massive new world order move, as you do in third world countries, but on a global scale, bankrupting everything so riots break out and martial law can be declared.
[02:19:59.738 --> 02:20:01.119]  Then they set up dictatorship.
[02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:03.461]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:03.621 --> 02:20:04.682]  Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[02:20:04.742 --> 02:20:05.202]  Quick break.
[02:20:05.222 --> 02:20:05.963]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:07.463 --> 02:20:08.964]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:20:09.144 --> 02:20:10.606]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:20:10.906 --> 02:20:13.128]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:20:13.588 --> 02:20:18.332]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:20:18.712 --> 02:20:21.555]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[02:21:08.174 --> 02:21:12.275]  Ted Anderson from Midas Wednesday, March 4, 2009 Gold 919.80 Hansco Coins can be purchased for $946.36, $473.18 for half, $236.59 for quarter.
[02:21:12.295 --> 02:21:12.795]  That's $949.36, $273.18 and $236.59.
[02:21:24.932 --> 02:21:37.337]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:21:37.477 --> 02:21:40.558]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:21:40.658 --> 02:21:43.919]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[02:21:43.999 --> 02:21:46.860]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:49.821]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[02:21:49.882 --> 02:21:50.142]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:50.162 --> 02:21:50.622]  Unlike your liberty,
[02:21:53.963 --> 02:21:54.924]  The paper is free.
[02:21:55.084 --> 02:21:57.065]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:57.986 --> 02:22:03.269]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:03.329 --> 02:22:06.731]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:07.872 --> 02:22:13.336]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[02:22:13.576 --> 02:22:14.897]  And we knew what to do.
[02:22:14.917 --> 02:22:16.678]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:22:16.918 --> 02:22:23.242]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:22:23.914 --> 02:22:32.497]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:22:32.837 --> 02:22:39.640]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:42.981]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:22:43.101 --> 02:22:48.323]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:22:48.863 --> 02:22:51.444]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:22:51.946 --> 02:22:57.790]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:22:57.990 --> 02:23:00.512]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:23:00.912 --> 02:23:05.916]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:23:07.897 --> 02:23:13.361]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:23:13.401 --> 02:23:13.921]  and the world.
[02:23:14.181 --> 02:23:16.903]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for
[02:23:18.032 --> 02:23:24.261]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:23:24.542 --> 02:23:26.324]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:23:26.564 --> 02:23:34.516]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:23:34.796 --> 02:23:39.221]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[02:23:39.502 --> 02:23:45.028]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:23:45.309 --> 02:23:47.311]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:23:47.491 --> 02:23:49.734]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[02:23:50.074 --> 02:23:50.855]  Free of charge.

[02:24:10.379 --> 02:24:14.922]  So many things are happening so fast right now that we've started another show, 9 to Midnight.
[02:24:15.142 --> 02:24:20.846]  Jason Bermas, the Infowarrior, on the Genesis Network and on the internet streams at Infowars.com.
[02:24:20.866 --> 02:24:26.969]  Also, it's PrisonPlanet.tv, the full three hours, just like we've done three of the four hours today live TV.
[02:24:27.450 --> 02:24:29.491]  He's doing all three every night live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:24:31.405 --> 02:24:32.966]  Alright, going back to Lindsey Williams.
[02:24:33.106 --> 02:24:35.107]  I may even cancel the State Rep is coming on.
[02:24:35.488 --> 02:24:36.988]  He's introduced a pro-Tenth Amendment.
[02:24:37.389 --> 02:24:39.570]  Said things saying they're not going to follow the Fed's gun control.
[02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:42.472]  This is in Alabama, Representative Mark, uh...
[02:24:43.854 --> 02:24:45.775]  Kiki, but we'll see what happens.
[02:24:45.795 --> 02:24:50.678]  This Lindsey Williams stuff is so important, but maybe we'll just have to wrap on for five minutes while he's with us and then go back to Lindsey.
[02:24:51.139 --> 02:24:52.940]  Okay, Lindsey, recap.
[02:24:52.980 --> 02:24:55.522]  Going into what's happening to the farmers, not just here, but worldwide.
[02:24:56.522 --> 02:24:58.563]  Riots are breaking out all over the planet over the last year.
[02:24:58.964 --> 02:25:00.405]  Countries are falling all over Africa.
[02:25:02.606 --> 02:25:04.767]  I mean, you name it, it is getting crazy.
[02:25:04.807 --> 02:25:08.347]  I listen to the BBC every day in my car on XM, and it's another country falling.
[02:25:08.387 --> 02:25:09.588]  Revolutions everywhere.
[02:25:09.668 --> 02:25:10.848]  CIA-backed coups.
[02:25:11.148 --> 02:25:13.089]  The globalists are moving on all fronts right now.
[02:25:13.129 --> 02:25:13.769]  Please continue.
[02:25:14.749 --> 02:25:26.892]  Everything that the elitists planned a year ago, a year and a half ago, what they've planned for many years in the financial crisis with what's happening in real estate and banking in America right now, all of this was planned many, many years ago.
[02:25:27.392 --> 02:25:31.453]  They knew everything they were going to do in advance, and now it comes down to the one thing,
[02:25:32.014 --> 02:25:35.015]  That whenever you control that, you control the masses of population.
[02:25:35.035 --> 02:25:37.155]  Now, there are two things that every human being must have.
[02:25:37.255 --> 02:25:38.496]  You've got to have water.
[02:25:39.136 --> 02:25:41.916]  At least once every 24 hours, you must drink water.
[02:25:42.276 --> 02:25:44.037]  There's something else you have to have to live.
[02:25:44.477 --> 02:25:48.458]  You might do without a house or an automobile or some of these other things, like a boat and so on.
[02:25:48.818 --> 02:25:50.758]  You cannot do without food.
[02:25:51.379 --> 02:25:52.779]  It finally has come to that.
[02:25:53.119 --> 02:25:55.119]  They've gotten the farmers right where they want them.
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:55.940]  Beedle Rock.
[02:25:56.420 --> 02:25:57.400]  Campo, Colorado.
[02:25:57.901 --> 02:25:58.881]  Thousands of acres.
[02:25:58.901 --> 02:26:01.563]  40% of the food supply of America.
[02:26:01.763 --> 02:26:05.564]  Corn right now, they're selling it for $3 a bushel.
[02:26:05.644 --> 02:26:06.905]  Now, this was this weekend.
[02:26:07.585 --> 02:26:11.587]  It cost them to raise that corn $5.50 a bushel.
[02:26:11.647 --> 02:26:13.528]  They cannot put their crops in this spring.
[02:26:13.848 --> 02:26:14.088]  Wheat.
[02:26:14.668 --> 02:26:17.189]  Wheat, they're getting for it right now $5 a bushel.
[02:26:17.549 --> 02:26:21.531]  It cost them to raise that wheat $6 to $7 a bushel.
[02:26:21.911 --> 02:26:23.812]  And the farmers, what are they going to do?
[02:26:23.832 --> 02:26:24.932]  They can't plant.
[02:26:25.292 --> 02:26:25.933]  I asked Vita.
[02:26:27.083 --> 02:26:28.103]  Where are the farmers going?
[02:26:28.404 --> 02:26:32.945]  She said, the only farmers that are going to plant this spring are those who have irrigated crops.
[02:26:33.545 --> 02:26:36.366]  And she said, they know they aren't going to be able to produce enough.
[02:26:36.887 --> 02:26:43.749]  And she said, they are planning, and they're depending on the insurance to bail them out, regardless of what happens to the weather.
[02:26:44.109 --> 02:26:46.730]  She said, Lindsey, there's going to be a major crisis.
[02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:48.050]  Folks, please listen to this.
[02:26:49.051 --> 02:26:50.251]  This startled me to no end.
[02:26:50.531 --> 02:26:51.572]  She said one other thing.
[02:26:51.892 --> 02:26:55.113]  She said, Chaplain Williams, she said, listen,
[02:26:55.615 --> 02:26:56.675]  There was nothing.
[02:26:57.055 --> 02:26:57.816]  Folks, please.
[02:26:58.716 --> 02:27:00.816]  You've got to see what our President is doing.
[02:27:01.256 --> 02:27:03.277]  Nothing in the stimulus package.
[02:27:03.977 --> 02:27:08.538]  Not one penny in the stimulus package was earmarked for farmers.
[02:27:08.778 --> 02:27:09.778]  It's all for the bankers.
[02:27:10.058 --> 02:27:10.719]  All for the bankers.
[02:27:10.759 --> 02:27:11.559]  All for the bankers.
[02:27:11.879 --> 02:27:14.720]  All for the bailout of the money people.
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:16.740]  All of their friends and their cronies.
[02:27:17.180 --> 02:27:17.780]  But nothing.
[02:27:18.140 --> 02:27:19.201]  Not one penny.
[02:27:19.501 --> 02:27:20.181]  Think of it now.
[02:27:20.281 --> 02:27:22.221]  Go back to the stimulus package for yourself.
[02:27:22.281 --> 02:27:24.462]  Think of everything you've heard about it for the last few weeks.
[02:27:25.121 --> 02:27:31.643]  Nothing in the stimulus package was earmarked for the farmers of America, and yet they cannot plant their crops this spring.
[02:27:31.683 --> 02:27:38.505]  And I said to Vida, I said, Vida, how long is this going to, how long before this is going to show up on the store shelves?
[02:27:38.905 --> 02:27:42.106]  She said, Lindsey, we can't plant this spring.
[02:27:42.406 --> 02:27:44.446]  She said, there's nothing we can do about it.
[02:27:45.066 --> 02:27:47.027]  Our farms, many of them are going to be lost.
[02:27:47.627 --> 02:27:50.568]  She said, next fall, the crop's not going to be there.
[02:27:51.018 --> 02:27:58.082]  For those who do irrigate and will dare to plant, knowing that about all they're going to get is the insurance out of it, she said the food's not going to be there.
[02:27:58.402 --> 02:28:00.424]  She said, you have about six to nine.
[02:28:00.524 --> 02:28:02.825]  Now, Alex, this is what's so amazing.
[02:28:03.305 --> 02:28:17.474]  This man indicated to me that nine to 12 months, six to nine to 12, he didn't say exactly how long, there would be this crisis that would appear in America, and it is going exactly almost to the month
[02:28:18.137 --> 02:28:21.320]  What this man told me was going to happen when I broke it on you.
[02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:24.742]  I am so glad you allowed me to tell it on July the 28th.
[02:28:24.862 --> 02:28:32.288]  Otherwise, many people in the listening audience would have difficulty believing today that they had all this planned in advance.
[02:28:32.369 --> 02:28:33.169]  But they did!
[02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:40.195]  And now I would come down to the one control item that if you want to control the masses of people, you control the food.
[02:28:40.675 --> 02:28:43.417]  And this weekend, Vito Locke said to me, folks, go to it.
[02:28:43.498 --> 02:28:44.478]  Look in the phone directory.
[02:28:44.518 --> 02:28:44.959]  Call her up.
[02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:49.025]  If you doubt what I'm saying... No, no, no, listen, listen, listen.
[02:28:49.385 --> 02:28:55.454]  Beef is more in the stores, but because the meat packers, four companies have bought up all of the processing...
[02:28:56.696 --> 02:28:59.498]  The people raising cattle are literally going bankrupt.
[02:28:59.519 --> 02:29:02.161]  They can't even make the money they put into it on selling them.
[02:29:02.181 --> 02:29:03.002]  They're losing money.
[02:29:03.302 --> 02:29:04.663]  The cows are stacking up.
[02:29:05.063 --> 02:29:05.944]  The beef is more.
[02:29:06.224 --> 02:29:15.052]  Just like all the raw materials, the corn, the wheat is more at the store, but they've gotten it so imploded at the grassroots level of the economy that they've got a shortage of it.
[02:29:15.072 --> 02:29:18.295]  You know, just like when they have a shortage of gold, its price doesn't go up.
[02:29:18.855 --> 02:29:20.637]  This is not a free market.
[02:29:20.677 --> 02:29:27.783]  This is a controlled system, and they're coming in with the animal idea, the Primus Society, shutting down the farms, controlling them.
[02:29:28.144 --> 02:29:35.731]  With carbon taxes in New Zealand and Australia, the headlines are just shutting down their farms, because there's hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes just on a few sheep.
[02:29:36.071 --> 02:29:40.215]  I mean, this is total feudalism, total control by design.
[02:29:40.235 --> 02:29:42.477]  I promised, we're going to have Lindsay on for an hour and a half, but
[02:29:42.777 --> 02:29:43.677]  We got the time zones messed up.
[02:29:43.697 --> 02:29:44.838]  We're gonna have him back up soon.
[02:29:44.858 --> 02:29:46.318]  We're gonna come back with him for the rest of the hour.
[02:29:46.358 --> 02:29:47.659]  I've cancelled the state rep.
[02:29:47.679 --> 02:29:49.179]  We'll have him back on about the Second Amendment.
[02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:52.221]  This is too important with Lindsey Williams and I promise to take a few calls.
[02:29:52.481 --> 02:29:54.942]  So specifically for Lindsey Williams, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:57.602 --> 02:29:58.483]  We're on the march.
[02:29:58.983 --> 02:30:00.604]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.524 --> 02:30:04.205]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:07.714 --> 02:30:11.016]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[02:30:11.256 --> 02:30:13.618]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?

[02:31:07.677 --> 02:31:14.060]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:31:14.440 --> 02:31:16.421]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:31:17.081 --> 02:31:18.101]  But who is the enemy?
[02:31:18.641 --> 02:31:19.142]  Bin Laden.
[02:31:19.442 --> 02:31:20.242]  This is his MO.
[02:31:20.282 --> 02:31:21.723]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:31:21.743 --> 02:31:23.463]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:31:23.804 --> 02:31:30.546]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:31:30.946 --> 02:31:31.387]  Some U.S.
[02:31:31.427 --> 02:31:37.089]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:31:37.769 --> 02:31:41.251]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:31:41.271 --> 02:31:43.412]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.

[02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:14.312]  The globalists are militarily and economically moving against us on every front, but the people are awakening.
[02:33:14.352 --> 02:33:17.312]  This is their point of greatest strength and greatest weakness.
[02:33:17.332 --> 02:33:20.013]  Their operations are being launched worldwide.
[02:33:20.133 --> 02:33:21.253]  Coups, murders.
[02:33:21.693 --> 02:33:25.054]  Just Google African presidents being killed, prime ministers, generals.
[02:33:27.580 --> 02:33:30.301]  Madagascar, Eastern Europe, Asia.
[02:33:30.681 --> 02:33:32.042]  They are moving on every front.
[02:33:32.822 --> 02:33:36.183]  Fights between Russia and the United States over who controls what countries.
[02:33:37.204 --> 02:33:38.764]  Payoffs going on on both sides.
[02:33:39.064 --> 02:33:40.185]  It's all happening.
[02:33:40.785 --> 02:33:44.166]  Historians say that more happens sometimes in a year than happens in the previous hundred.
[02:33:44.907 --> 02:33:50.469]  Lennon had another wicked quote along those lines about sometimes things happen more in a week than happen in a decade.
[02:33:51.414 --> 02:33:52.074]  We're in that now.
[02:33:52.094 --> 02:33:59.498]  We're about to go back to Lindsey Williams right now, but I have been rampaging here on air with all this key info for two hours, three hours, and thirty-three minutes.
[02:33:59.518 --> 02:34:00.719]  Three hours and thirty-three minutes.
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:07.282]  And it is sponsors that make this show possible, so I want to name a few of those sponsors right now that I believe in, that I use.
[02:34:07.623 --> 02:34:09.343]  I'm drinking a Cola Blue water right here, baby.
[02:34:09.363 --> 02:34:11.605]  I love it.
[02:34:11.825 --> 02:34:12.925]  Right here in the office, right out of the air.
[02:34:12.945 --> 02:34:13.526]  People go, what is it?
[02:34:13.546 --> 02:34:14.846]  There's no water bottle on top of it.
[02:34:14.926 --> 02:34:15.727]  No, it's out of the air.
[02:34:17.091 --> 02:34:18.351]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[02:34:18.391 --> 02:34:19.212]  Pays for itself in one year.
[02:34:19.232 --> 02:34:20.172]  You buy your water from the store.
[02:34:20.212 --> 02:34:21.933]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride, without anything.
[02:34:21.973 --> 02:34:23.953]  Goes through seven filters inside.
[02:34:24.313 --> 02:34:25.514]  You hear the ad I run, it's wrong.
[02:34:25.534 --> 02:34:26.854]  I've got to recut it and say five filters.
[02:34:26.874 --> 02:34:27.294]  It's seven.
[02:34:27.775 --> 02:34:28.855]  Just an amazing system.
[02:34:28.875 --> 02:34:29.775]  Great tasting, pure H2O.
[02:34:29.835 --> 02:34:30.956]  Exactly the way nature makes it.
[02:34:30.976 --> 02:34:31.756]  1-800-691-6043.
[02:34:31.776 --> 02:34:35.057]  Hook it up to a solar panel.
[02:34:35.157 --> 02:34:36.137]  Don't even need a well, folks.
[02:34:36.458 --> 02:34:38.418]  By the way, we just drilled another well in our family land.
[02:34:38.678 --> 02:34:39.659]  We had one 300-footer.
[02:34:39.719 --> 02:34:41.459]  We went in 800 feet deep secure water.
[02:34:41.819 --> 02:34:43.240]  I mean, I'm getting ready, okay?
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:49.126]  And we hope to avert all this, but I mean, I got guns and food and I'm going to take care of my family, folks.
[02:34:49.146 --> 02:34:50.267]  What I'm telling you, I believe in.
[02:34:50.287 --> 02:34:50.788]  1-800-691-6043.
[02:34:50.808 --> 02:34:50.868]  1-800-691-6043.
[02:34:57.042 --> 02:35:01.426]  NicolaBlue.com, E-C-O-L-O, blue.com, get yours today.
[02:35:02.246 --> 02:35:16.238]  Another fine sponsor that makes this show possible is the best storable foods company out there, the biggest storable foods company out there, non-GMO, it's just amazing quality food, great prices, 800-409-5633, eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:35:16.498 --> 02:35:18.419]  You'll never stand in the bread line if you have your own food.
[02:35:18.439 --> 02:35:18.820]  The U.N.
[02:35:18.860 --> 02:35:20.061]  has said, just Google, the U.N.
[02:35:20.081 --> 02:35:21.142]  says, use food as a weapon.
[02:35:21.342 --> 02:35:22.322]  You'll read the official U.N.
[02:35:22.362 --> 02:35:23.764]  website saying they use it as a weapon.
[02:35:24.224 --> 02:35:24.764]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[02:35:24.905 --> 02:35:35.133]  Our job is to get folks prepared, and it's symbiotic that the sponsors also make the show possible, and the incredible amount of funds it takes to run this.
[02:35:35.153 --> 02:35:36.894]  So we thank eFoodsDirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[02:35:36.954 --> 02:35:51.286]  And one other sponsor that I wanted to tell you about, and it also goes along the lines of preparedness, and that's MySolarBackup.com, from the great folks at Solutions from Science.
[02:35:52.486 --> 02:35:58.791]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of a power source, 1800 power plant, and a high-efficiency solar plant designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:35:58.811 --> 02:36:00.812]  That's right, it generates free electricity once you have the unit.
[02:36:01.093 --> 02:36:06.096]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in blackouts, gas pumps can't work because they run on electricity.
[02:36:06.136 --> 02:36:09.459]  The solar generator is like having your own power plant hidden in your home.
[02:36:09.819 --> 02:36:11.681]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[02:36:11.701 --> 02:36:13.062]  If you need more power, get more units.
[02:36:13.582 --> 02:36:14.883]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:36:14.923 --> 02:36:16.184]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:36:16.204 --> 02:36:16.244]  877-327-0365.
[02:36:22.611 --> 02:36:24.634]  Again, MySolarBackup.com.
[02:36:26.637 --> 02:36:31.083]  Another group I want to plug, not really even a sponsor, they are on the website, but I just want to have them on as guests, period, to promote it.
[02:36:31.403 --> 02:36:34.668]  You're not even as sponsors is TruthRadio.com.
[02:36:35.609 --> 02:36:36.510]  Or is it Truth AM?
[02:36:37.657 --> 02:36:43.079]  That's right, trutham.com, trutham.com, trutham.com, trutham.com.
[02:36:43.479 --> 02:36:48.402]  These little AMs, FCC license, legal, they go out three miles.
[02:36:48.762 --> 02:36:53.404]  You put that in your area, on your house, put up signs all over the three miles, that's how we're going to beat them.
[02:36:53.664 --> 02:36:57.305]  Trutham.com is throwing that into, they're not even paying for me to do that.
[02:36:57.385 --> 02:36:57.906]  I believe in it.
[02:36:57.946 --> 02:37:00.166]  We've got to get micro-FMs up, whatever.
[02:37:00.186 --> 02:37:01.827]  I mean, we've got to do it now, folks.
[02:37:01.847 --> 02:37:03.628]  We've got to move now to fight these people.
[02:37:03.688 --> 02:37:03.948]  Okay.
[02:37:04.808 --> 02:37:05.869]  That said, that done.
[02:37:08.135 --> 02:37:11.456]  It's just, it's just amazing.
[02:37:11.476 --> 02:37:14.956]  Lindsey Williams, please continue, sir, with what this guy told you.
[02:37:14.976 --> 02:37:21.538]  Because when you came on six months ago, you told, seven months ago, you told Dr. Stan Monteith about this.
[02:37:21.698 --> 02:37:27.079]  You couldn't go public at the time, but then six months ago you did, when oil was right up at 147, 148 a barrel, now below 40.
[02:37:28.359 --> 02:37:33.380]  He said they were going to implode that, bring in World Depression, have crises in the U.S.
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:35.060]  He told you, you better get out of the U.S.
[02:37:35.501 --> 02:37:36.241]  There's nowhere to run.
[02:37:36.261 --> 02:37:36.961]  This is worldwide.
[02:37:37.001 --> 02:37:37.561]  Please continue.
[02:37:38.564 --> 02:37:39.605]  How fast can it happen?
[02:37:40.545 --> 02:37:41.786]  I do not want to frighten you.
[02:37:42.246 --> 02:37:44.347]  And I'm sure Alex doesn't want to frighten you.
[02:37:44.387 --> 02:37:46.008]  He just tells you the truth like it is.
[02:37:46.849 --> 02:37:48.229]  This is how fast it can happen.
[02:37:48.269 --> 02:37:50.751]  Two weeks ago, the Latvian government collapsed.
[02:37:51.411 --> 02:37:53.372]  Now the first government to collapse was Iceland.
[02:37:53.472 --> 02:37:55.213]  You remember that about three to four months ago?
[02:37:55.373 --> 02:37:55.633]  Yes.
[02:37:55.653 --> 02:37:57.835]  It was havoc in that country shortly afterwards.
[02:37:57.855 --> 02:37:58.535]  And it's still havoc!
[02:37:59.332 --> 02:38:00.532]  Yeah, and this is it.
[02:38:00.772 --> 02:38:03.713]  Oh yeah, it won't be anything but bankrupt.
[02:38:03.733 --> 02:38:07.074]  From now on, I'll be in the second country to declare bankruptcy.
[02:38:07.374 --> 02:38:09.454]  Latvian government, two weeks ago.
[02:38:09.894 --> 02:38:13.375]  Now, I want you to see just how fast things can happen.
[02:38:13.415 --> 02:38:17.976]  And folks, this is just how fast it will happen in the United States of America.
[02:38:18.296 --> 02:38:18.996]  I beg of you.
[02:38:19.556 --> 02:38:22.577]  Understand, it can take place within a matter of hours.
[02:38:22.637 --> 02:38:22.957]  Here it is.
[02:38:23.277 --> 02:38:25.317]  Latvian government collapsed.
[02:38:25.618 --> 02:38:27.798]  Government is cutting spending wherever it can.
[02:38:28.283 --> 02:38:31.766]  Hospitals, schools throughout the country are on threat of closure.
[02:38:32.987 --> 02:38:33.667]  In two weeks!
[02:38:34.368 --> 02:38:40.792]  As local administrations find their budgets reduced to as much as 40 percent, government salaries have been cut 25 percent.
[02:38:41.453 --> 02:38:41.973]  Two weeks!
[02:38:42.854 --> 02:38:45.075]  Do you know how fast this can happen in America?
[02:38:45.316 --> 02:38:52.681]  Meanwhile, the country's export-driven economy, which burned red-hot at the height of everything going so well, has ground to a halt.
[02:38:52.821 --> 02:38:55.403]  Unemployment has rocketed in Latvia.
[02:38:55.891 --> 02:39:00.053]  Those who have managed to hold on to their jobs are receiving significantly less pay.
[02:39:00.113 --> 02:39:17.280]  And they're predicting that every Eastern European country is going to basically completely collapse, a domino effect into Asia, the Middle East, the United States, and then meanwhile Fox News is blaming it on Russia and saying the Russians want us to collapse in these weird spin articles when Russia has nothing to do with it.
[02:39:18.340 --> 02:39:21.882]  Yeah, and construction, real estate, farming has ground to a halt.
[02:39:23.077 --> 02:39:27.098]  Folks, this is just how fast it can happen in the United States of America.
[02:39:27.518 --> 02:39:28.999]  Don't think that we're alarmists.
[02:39:29.059 --> 02:39:29.479]  We aren't.
[02:39:29.519 --> 02:39:32.400]  We're realists, and we're trying our best to tell you.
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:36.021]  I was told seven months ago that this was going to happen.
[02:39:36.481 --> 02:39:38.181]  They had it planned in advance.
[02:39:38.561 --> 02:39:43.363]  He said America will see a financial collapse that will be so great it will take years to come out of it.
[02:39:43.763 --> 02:39:44.923]  Don't think it's going to
[02:39:45.579 --> 02:39:46.980]  Come out in 24 hours.
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:50.601]  Our president is not going to bring it out in six months to a year.
[02:39:50.981 --> 02:39:56.083]  This is going to be a long-term thing that you must make preparation for right now.
[02:39:56.824 --> 02:40:06.708]  Already, OPEC has lost in four months time, all producing countries of the world, have lost two and one half trillion dollars in four months time.
[02:40:07.068 --> 02:40:09.029]  They cannot buy our treasury bills.
[02:40:09.309 --> 02:40:12.570]  Now, here's the next, this is the thing that is startling so much.
[02:40:12.830 --> 02:40:14.971]  Whenever you consider that Macy's,
[02:40:15.697 --> 02:40:18.459]  That their profits down 51, 59 percent.
[02:40:18.479 --> 02:40:19.980]  Targets down 41 percent.
[02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:21.641]  JCPenney down 41 percent.
[02:40:23.442 --> 02:40:26.744]  Office Depot lost 1.5 billion dollars in the last quarter.
[02:40:27.245 --> 02:40:38.833]  Now think of all the taxes that would have gone to the federal government and the state governments if these stores had still been doing 100 percent of business.
[02:40:39.033 --> 02:40:43.896]  Think 75 percent of the taxes that come in at the gas pump on the gallon of gasoline
[02:40:44.218 --> 02:40:47.100]  I'm no longer going to the federal government and state governments.
[02:40:47.601 --> 02:41:06.756]  The thing I am so drastically concerned about at this point is every state in America, whenever they figure up their books, which usually takes two to three months for them to catch up with where their bookkeeping is, they are going to realize that they have lost 60 to 70 to 75% depending on the product in the store of their tax structure.
[02:41:07.076 --> 02:41:08.998]  They're not going to be able to support the schools.
[02:41:09.298 --> 02:41:10.759]  I mean, don't go out there and riot.
[02:41:11.426 --> 02:41:13.929]  And say, oh, we ought to have more for our children.
[02:41:14.169 --> 02:41:15.591]  Well, the tax structure's not there.
[02:41:15.711 --> 02:41:17.193]  They want you to play into that.
[02:41:17.233 --> 02:41:19.355]  That's why they're hyping the thing to do is riots.
[02:41:19.675 --> 02:41:21.978]  They have provocateur groups on record.
[02:41:21.998 --> 02:41:24.100]  Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation funding it.
[02:41:24.381 --> 02:41:27.344]  So when everything implodes, they're going to put us into forced labor camps.
[02:41:27.444 --> 02:41:28.205]  Officially built.
[02:41:28.265 --> 02:41:30.127]  I'm holding up the Army list of 24 mass camps.
[02:41:31.769 --> 02:41:33.389]  This will hold tens of millions of Americans.
[02:41:33.409 --> 02:41:34.410]  This is not a game.
[02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:36.550]  This is not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:36.770 --> 02:41:39.731]  If you don't say no to this, if you don't realize who the enemy is, it's all over.
[02:41:40.011 --> 02:41:42.312]  Go ahead, CIA, FBI, police, play along.
[02:41:42.512 --> 02:41:43.893]  You're going to ruin your future, too.
[02:41:44.193 --> 02:41:46.993]  It's time to gut up and decide who you're with and who you stand with.
[02:41:48.294 --> 02:41:53.395]  And someone said to me the other day, they said, Pastor Williams, these people live in America.
[02:41:53.435 --> 02:41:54.476]  They said, you know who they are?
[02:41:54.496 --> 02:41:55.876]  I said, yes, I know many of them.
[02:41:56.256 --> 02:41:58.377]  They said, do they live in the United States of America?
[02:41:58.437 --> 02:41:59.337]  I said, most of them do.
[02:42:00.051 --> 02:42:02.653]  They said, well, do they want to destroy their own country?
[02:42:02.773 --> 02:42:04.974]  I said, no, they're not destroying their own country.
[02:42:05.415 --> 02:42:07.916]  They have everything in the world to gain by this.
[02:42:08.277 --> 02:42:10.678]  They are going to hold the banks of America.
[02:42:10.698 --> 02:42:13.160]  They're going to own the lending institutions of America.
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:15.542]  They're going to own the mom and pop businesses.
[02:42:15.602 --> 02:42:19.364]  Go to the shopping centers and see how many stores are vacant now.
[02:42:19.644 --> 02:42:21.406]  Look what's happening to the banking system.
[02:42:21.426 --> 02:42:23.367]  They're going to own the real estate of America.
[02:42:23.757 --> 02:42:26.618]  You realize that every mortgage house was mortgaged?
[02:42:27.178 --> 02:42:39.060]  You got your mortgage from some lending institution which now belongs to the elite by way of the Federal Reserve, through the Treasury of the United States of America bailing them out, and they are going to own the majority of the real estate of America.
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:41.761]  They have everything to gain by what they're doing.
[02:42:42.141 --> 02:42:46.782]  David Walker, former Comptroller General of the United States of America, said it so well.
[02:42:47.338 --> 02:42:49.899]  Now, he held the currency for a while until he retired.
[02:42:49.939 --> 02:42:54.860]  He said, America's unfunded liability is $66 trillion.
[02:42:55.801 --> 02:42:59.742]  That includes the national debt, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid.
[02:42:59.982 --> 02:43:05.924]  $66 trillion is more than the GDP, the gross domestic product, of the entire world.
[02:43:06.344 --> 02:43:13.606]  The whole world's GDP is only $65 trillion, and America's unfunded liability is $66 trillion.
[02:43:14.221 --> 02:43:18.442]  And America has more debt than all the rest of the world combined.
[02:43:18.983 --> 02:43:27.545]  America must attract 17% of the world's capital in any given day just to service the debt, the interest on the national debt.
[02:43:27.846 --> 02:43:29.046]  Alex, there is no way out.
[02:43:29.066 --> 02:43:37.389]  I mean, they have it all set so that when it's all over with and the smoke is cleared, if they have their way, they will control this.
[02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:38.609]  But Alex, they're not going to do it.
[02:43:39.069 --> 02:43:41.350]  They're not going to do it because of programs like yours.
[02:43:42.023 --> 02:43:44.846]  And there's one thing that I found that these people fear.
[02:43:44.886 --> 02:43:50.731]  When I lived with them for those three years, they are scared to death of the masses of people in America waking up.
[02:43:51.051 --> 02:43:52.492]  It's the only thing that bothers them.
[02:43:52.793 --> 02:43:54.214]  Everything else is secondary.
[02:43:54.637 --> 02:43:56.519]  And the American people are waking up.
[02:43:56.619 --> 02:44:00.222]  I am amazed at what I'm hearing lately as to how many are taking action.
[02:44:14.634 --> 02:44:25.416]  They've had people secretly for 11 years on these, and now they're just announcing it all, throwing it in everyone's face, and Glenn Beck's making jokes about it like we can trust him, saying he'll look into it, and then giggling and snickering.
[02:44:26.156 --> 02:44:29.237]  I mean, they're being forced to talk about this because everybody's starting to wake up to them.
[02:44:30.417 --> 02:44:31.477]  Yes, they are, exactly.
[02:44:31.497 --> 02:44:36.518]  Now, Alex, would you let me say just a brief word about the two presentations I've just presented?
[02:44:37.118 --> 02:44:37.758]  Absolutely!
[02:44:37.798 --> 02:44:40.498]  In fact, let's do that, but then I want to, because I've got you to the end of the show.
[02:44:40.518 --> 02:44:41.879]  I cancelled the other guest, Lindsey.
[02:44:41.899 --> 02:44:43.159]  You can stay another 15 minutes, right?
[02:44:44.147 --> 02:44:45.688]  Okay, yeah, oh, I'd be more than happy.
[02:44:45.708 --> 02:44:46.609]  Consider it a privilege.
[02:44:46.689 --> 02:44:53.474]  Okay, well, I want folks to have time to get a pen and paper, and we'll do that at the end of the show, because it's so important that they get this information and spread it to everybody, because you want them to copy it.
[02:44:53.514 --> 02:44:59.198]  But before we do that, again, you're saying that you believe this can at least be blunted and stopped.
[02:44:59.718 --> 02:45:02.640]  If people decide the government's going to save them, they're going to win and get the whole thing away.
[02:45:02.660 --> 02:45:03.981]  I mean, they're going to get away with it.
[02:45:04.722 --> 02:45:08.164]  What do we do to stop them, in your mind, in your research?
[02:45:08.204 --> 02:45:09.105]  What are they most afraid of?
[02:45:09.165 --> 02:45:10.086]  How do we defeat this?
[02:45:11.018 --> 02:45:16.363]  The one thing that will defeat them more than anything else is for the information to be given out, just like you're doing.
[02:45:17.043 --> 02:45:20.086]  Just blast it all across America, every place possible.
[02:45:20.146 --> 02:45:21.127]  Put it on the internet.
[02:45:21.167 --> 02:45:23.008]  You say you're doing another program at night.
[02:45:23.128 --> 02:45:24.209]  Congratulations.
[02:45:24.289 --> 02:45:25.370]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:45:25.390 --> 02:45:27.052]  I appreciate it so much.
[02:45:27.572 --> 02:45:29.594]  Get the message out to the American people.
[02:45:29.614 --> 02:45:30.375]  Now, people are hurting.
[02:45:30.775 --> 02:45:31.556]  Remember one thing.
[02:45:31.836 --> 02:45:34.618]  The most sensitive part of anybody's anatomy is the rear pocket.
[02:45:35.059 --> 02:45:38.802]  And right now, people are hurting where the dollar is.
[02:45:39.381 --> 02:45:43.963]  And they will wake up when, before they wouldn't even listen to you, they're beginning to listen now.
[02:45:43.983 --> 02:45:55.308]  Stock market's down $6,000 and some odd, and they're hurting to the point that for the first time they'll at least consider us wackos and give us some thought as to the fact that we might be right.
[02:45:55.628 --> 02:46:02.931]  And when you can, when you can document what you're saying, listen, listen to Alex Jones Show every single day so you can document what you're saying.
[02:46:03.231 --> 02:46:05.612]  Be able to prove every point that you give.
[02:46:06.053 --> 02:46:07.133]  Then you'll have no problem.
[02:46:07.543 --> 02:46:12.667]  Well, things like OPEC just lost two and one half trillion dollars in four months' time.
[02:46:13.087 --> 02:46:24.054]  Well, things such as the tax structure of the United States of America is in jeopardy, and wait 30 days from now, and when the states finally figure up their books and realize where they are, you have never seen such cuts yet.
[02:46:25.315 --> 02:46:35.082]  Listen, give these things that you're hearing on Alex Jones Show, and, you know, things are happening so fast, Alex, I'm glad that you punctuated a moment ago how quickly they're happening,
[02:46:35.407 --> 02:46:37.867]  Because people must listen to your show every day.
[02:46:38.127 --> 02:46:41.668]  This is an emergency situation!
[02:46:41.748 --> 02:46:46.489]  It's the people that did the Bolshevik Revolution and funded Hitler and Mao.
[02:46:47.149 --> 02:46:49.389]  Rockefeller wrote the New York Times and they funded Mao and did all that.
[02:46:49.449 --> 02:46:50.530]  They're doing it here!
[02:46:51.010 --> 02:46:55.291]  They destroy the economy to come in with FEMA camps, re-education, mass murder!
[02:46:55.311 --> 02:46:57.571]  They're going to do it if they think the cops will go along with it!
[02:46:57.811 --> 02:46:58.831]  It's over, police!
[02:46:59.031 --> 02:47:00.591]  You can't suck your thumbs anymore!
[02:47:00.912 --> 02:47:02.052]  Decide who you're with.
[02:47:02.412 --> 02:47:03.332]  Lindsey, please continue.
[02:47:04.042 --> 02:47:06.102]  They create a problem, then they create a solution.
[02:47:06.523 --> 02:47:07.983]  This is the way that they do everything.
[02:47:08.303 --> 02:47:10.643]  I watched them do it on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline.
[02:47:11.003 --> 02:47:21.666]  They would come in and give a few million dollars to the Sierra Club and to other groups that were costing them thousands of dollars.
[02:47:21.726 --> 02:47:25.386]  And I asked one of the oil men one day, I said, why do you give this to your enemies?
[02:47:25.707 --> 02:47:30.348]  The very people that are coming in and causing you to have to spend so much on this Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline.
[02:47:30.728 --> 02:47:32.548]  He said, Chaplain, we play both sides.
[02:47:33.018 --> 02:47:41.500]  They play Republican, they play Democrat, they play, they played the Conservatives, they can play both sides of everything.
[02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:44.461]  They said, we give these money to them so we can control them.
[02:47:44.801 --> 02:47:47.262]  The name of the game is control.
[02:47:47.302 --> 02:47:50.182]  You've heard me say it, you've heard Alex say it over and over and over.
[02:47:50.603 --> 02:47:51.663]  This is what they want.
[02:47:51.783 --> 02:47:54.183]  It's not necessarily money that they're after.
[02:47:54.464 --> 02:47:59.985]  They already hold that through the Federal Reserve, through the false currencies around the world.
[02:48:00.430 --> 02:48:02.071]  The name of the game is control.
[02:48:02.151 --> 02:48:06.734]  Same thing Hitler did, same thing Mussolini did, same thing Stalin did.
[02:48:07.115 --> 02:48:10.817]  It's a matter of control of masses of population and humanity.
[02:48:10.857 --> 02:48:12.178]  They're literally obsessed.
[02:48:12.659 --> 02:48:15.620]  With the control of this nation and that's what they're trying to do.
[02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:18.282]  That's why the elites have always been in control.
[02:48:18.622 --> 02:48:25.785]  The elites have always been in control because they're ruthless and cunning and the average person doesn't understand how serious the power elite are.
[02:48:25.805 --> 02:48:26.765]  Lindsey, I want to come back.
[02:48:27.266 --> 02:48:31.508]  Thinking of any other, we know his predictions, but now how those are all manifesting and
[02:48:32.708 --> 02:48:36.469]  Again, I want you specifically why you think George Soros went public with all of this right now.
[02:48:36.529 --> 02:48:39.691]  But first, folks, we don't have a lot of time, so listen carefully.
[02:48:39.951 --> 02:48:44.252]  You're now putting out weekly emergency DVD reports that break down this.
[02:48:44.472 --> 02:48:45.513]  Perfect to give people.
[02:48:46.073 --> 02:48:47.534]  How do folks call and get that, Lindsey?
[02:48:48.674 --> 02:48:51.295]  Call number 800-321-2900.
[02:48:52.355 --> 02:48:54.256]  Emergency update.
[02:48:54.356 --> 02:48:56.777]  We're having to update it every so many weeks because
[02:48:57.185 --> 02:49:01.967]  Things are happening so fast, and then last week I produced for the first time one entitled Prophecy.
[02:49:02.207 --> 02:49:02.968]  You've got to see it.
[02:49:03.388 --> 02:49:05.309]  I deal with the prophecy that this man gave.
[02:49:05.389 --> 02:49:10.631]  I call it a prophecy because, you know, the elite, even though they aren't God, they think they are.
[02:49:11.031 --> 02:49:24.217]  And they give some things, like this gentleman gave me seven months ago, told me everything that was going to happen for the next year and a half, and I produced one entitled Prophecy because it's what he said was going to happen, and then I go back to the Scriptures,
[02:49:24.773 --> 02:49:26.935]  And compare this to the one- Give the number!
[02:49:26.955 --> 02:49:27.575]  Give the number!
[02:49:27.956 --> 02:49:28.916]  Give the number for folks.
[02:49:44.912 --> 02:49:45.053]  3-2-1-2-9-0-0.
[02:49:47.634 --> 02:49:49.534]  Absolutely, and we appreciate your courage doing this.
[02:49:49.554 --> 02:49:51.055]  Okay, briefly, start getting into Soros.
[02:49:51.135 --> 02:49:58.358]  I mean, to have him admit they're imploding the oil price to bankrupt the planet and their enemies, I mean, again, this is six and a half months after you go public.
[02:49:58.618 --> 02:49:59.518]  Here they are admitting it.
[02:49:59.558 --> 02:50:00.159]  It's incredible.
[02:50:01.019 --> 02:50:02.880]  Well, I don't think he had any choice.
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:04.240]  Alex, you say, why did he do it?
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:08.582]  I think he did it because it happened.
[02:50:08.942 --> 02:50:09.342]  It's here.
[02:50:10.043 --> 02:50:11.063]  He knows it's for real.
[02:50:11.584 --> 02:50:21.232]  There was no need in trying to hide it any longer, and I think he did it solely because of the fact that he didn't have any choice but to do it, or make his own self look bad.
[02:50:21.593 --> 02:50:24.175]  That's what Bob Chapman said, agreeing with you last hour about it.
[02:50:24.555 --> 02:50:25.496]  They've dropped the hammer.
[02:50:25.516 --> 02:50:26.637]  They've gone to the point of no return.
[02:50:26.677 --> 02:50:33.022]  They've committed so many public crimes, looting with the banks, that either they take over with the world government, or they end up getting brought to justice.
[02:50:33.483 --> 02:50:34.203]  They know that.
[02:50:34.263 --> 02:50:39.328]  They know they're creating a revolution, which will create a crisis, exacerbate their crisis, and they'll come in and
[02:50:39.608 --> 02:50:41.069]  ...as the saviors.
[02:50:41.610 --> 02:50:42.831]  They are making their move.
[02:50:42.891 --> 02:50:44.192]  They have jumped out of the airplane.
[02:50:44.212 --> 02:50:45.193]  They're pulling the ripcord.
[02:50:45.213 --> 02:50:46.134]  Do they have a parachute?
[02:50:46.174 --> 02:50:46.834]  That's up to you.
[02:50:47.195 --> 02:50:50.217]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the pieces have been put in place.
[02:50:50.277 --> 02:50:51.819]  The domino has been flicked.
[02:50:52.219 --> 02:50:53.380]  It's now in motion.
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:51:00.486]  This is toe-to-toe combat with the eugenicist mass murder forces of what they call themselves, Luciferians.
[02:51:00.827 --> 02:51:01.707]  This is it.
[02:51:01.808 --> 02:51:03.269]  It is now upon us.
[02:51:03.629 --> 02:51:04.830]  What are you going to do?
[02:51:07.623 --> 02:51:13.285]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:51:13.565 --> 02:51:18.346]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[02:51:18.586 --> 02:51:23.568]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[02:51:23.768 --> 02:51:27.209]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[02:51:27.709 --> 02:51:35.879]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[02:51:36.219 --> 02:51:41.165]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[02:51:42.506 --> 02:51:42.886]  I think so.
[02:52:07.526 --> 02:52:20.249]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:52:20.669 --> 02:52:27.431]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[02:52:27.791 --> 02:52:31.354]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:52:31.735 --> 02:52:34.677]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:52:35.138 --> 02:52:42.664]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:52:45.947 --> 02:52:46.327]  I think so.
[02:53:07.873 --> 02:53:11.478]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[02:53:11.918 --> 02:53:13.300]  You are not alone.
[02:53:13.820 --> 02:53:16.344]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[02:53:16.684 --> 02:53:21.450]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[02:53:21.750 --> 02:53:23.933]  Signs include itching, pulling, tugging.
[02:53:23.953 --> 02:53:24.554]  We're good to go!

[02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:20.019]  Lindsay, I don't know how busy you are, but I want to set you up for a show you've never been on, my syndicated Sunday show.
[02:54:21.252 --> 02:54:25.374]  Briefly, can you come on this Sunday for an hour and a half so we can talk more about this and finally take calls?
[02:54:26.215 --> 02:54:30.017]  Alex, I would consider it a privilege to do it.
[02:54:30.037 --> 02:54:32.219]  All right, we're live 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:32.259 --> 02:54:32.599]  Central.
[02:54:32.639 --> 02:54:36.541]  Let's have you on from 4.30 Central to 6, an hour and a half on the show.
[02:54:36.561 --> 02:54:39.903]  I'm going to call this number 4.30 on Sunday.
[02:54:39.943 --> 02:54:40.744]  We will talk to you.
[02:54:40.924 --> 02:54:42.505]  I said we'd go to calls and the timer ran out.
[02:54:42.525 --> 02:54:46.447]  I'm going to try to jam in a few here, but just ask a question of Lindsey so you can briefly answer it.
[02:54:46.467 --> 02:54:47.908]  Okay, I'm only taking one or two of these.
[02:54:48.088 --> 02:54:49.349]  Steve in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:54:49.389 --> 02:54:49.709]  Go ahead.
[02:54:52.489 --> 02:54:54.371]  Hey, Alex, and hey, Pastor.
[02:54:55.131 --> 02:54:56.572]  Can you hear me?
[02:54:56.592 --> 02:54:56.692]  Yes.
[02:54:57.953 --> 02:54:58.454]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:54:58.574 --> 02:55:10.403]  Yeah, I was watching the news today, and I saw Gordon Brown addressing the Congress the same way that Obama did last week, with Biden behind him to the right, Pelosi to the left behind him.
[02:55:11.224 --> 02:55:21.532]  And he pretty much sold the Congress, and really everybody watching, everything but a vacuum cleaner, and announced everything, including a new global currency.
[02:55:22.063 --> 02:55:24.325]  I was wondering what you know about his role.
[02:55:24.565 --> 02:55:26.106]  I'm so glad that you mentioned global currency.
[02:55:26.226 --> 02:55:29.308]  It's my contention that they're going to bypass the North American Union and the Amero
[02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:48.341]  And we'll go directly to a global currency.
[02:55:48.381 --> 02:55:49.381]  That's just my opinion.
[02:55:49.761 --> 02:55:55.943]  This person did not say that to me back in July, but it looks that they have jumped, literally leaped into the future.
[02:55:56.344 --> 02:56:00.085]  All right, Lindsey, I'm going to talk to you for an hour and a half Sunday, 4.30 to 6 p.m.
[02:56:00.205 --> 02:56:02.686]  The last hour and a half of the two-hour Sunday show.
[02:56:02.726 --> 02:56:04.406]  We'll be calling you at this number, sir.
[02:56:04.486 --> 02:56:05.247]  I will see you then.
[02:56:05.287 --> 02:56:05.767]  God bless you.
[02:56:06.431 --> 02:56:07.752]  Thank you, Alex, and likewise.
[02:56:07.873 --> 02:56:11.937]  Lord bless you greatly, because you are such a voice out there and a watchman on the wall.
[02:56:12.197 --> 02:56:13.699]  Well, how would we not do what we do?
[02:56:13.819 --> 02:56:16.862]  I mean, we're just telling the truth and we know what's happening, so you too, my friend.
[02:56:16.902 --> 02:56:17.363]  God bless you.
[02:56:17.403 --> 02:56:17.743]  Take care.
[02:56:18.638 --> 02:56:21.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't get to everybody else.
[02:56:21.260 --> 02:56:23.181]  Kevin and Joy and Mark and Jay and everybody else.
[02:56:24.542 --> 02:56:26.103]  We're just out of time for this transmission.
[02:56:26.123 --> 02:56:33.107]  Jason Burmiss is coming up tonight, 9 to midnight, here on the Genesis Network and streaming at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv to be able to view it.
[02:56:33.447 --> 02:56:34.468]  Please spread the word about that.
[02:56:34.488 --> 02:56:36.749]  I'm up here at night a lot, so I pop in on the show as well.
[02:56:36.769 --> 02:56:38.150]  A lot of important, informative guests there.
[02:56:38.170 --> 02:56:47.475]  I just want to bring him up for a minute and a half at the end of the show because, yes, it funds this operation, but it's a great deal and we need more capital to operate, but really not much comes in, you know, as
[02:56:48.496 --> 02:56:51.217]  Yeah, right now Frank's at $220, British Sovereign's at $262, Franklin Have's at $869.
[02:57:15.635 --> 02:57:19.417]  All those are really good buy, Alex, and you're just exactly right on the money on that.
[02:57:20.118 --> 02:57:40.670]  Unemployment figures came out, the markets, the gold, the bank stocks, I mean, everything out there is just turmoil and trouble, and this is one of those opportunities that, you know, we've always talked about it, how I'm buying low, holding on to it, the market goes up, and I get a chance to sell it at a discount to the higher prices there.
[02:57:41.050 --> 02:57:44.052]  Right now is one of those times where I'm in there just accumulating all I can.
[02:57:44.468 --> 02:57:52.611]  I'm smart enough to know that the economic problems of the United States of America have not been solved and now is the time to be buying hands down.
[02:57:52.631 --> 02:57:54.612]  Yeah, they're inflating the currency like gangbusters.
[02:57:54.632 --> 02:57:56.552]  The banks are teetering and imploding all around us.
[02:57:56.892 --> 02:57:57.513]  Folks, give them a call.
[02:57:57.533 --> 02:57:58.533]  You can't beat these deals.
[02:57:58.633 --> 02:58:01.054]  You also have the silver dollars at an insane price.
[02:58:01.074 --> 02:58:01.954]  The silver half dollars.
[02:58:02.294 --> 02:58:02.975]  Yep, sure do.
[02:58:03.035 --> 02:58:03.955]  Yep, we sure do.
[02:58:04.395 --> 02:58:04.856]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:04.876 --> 02:58:06.598]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:06.618 --> 02:58:09.682]  Here's that number.
[02:58:09.702 --> 02:58:10.823]  It'll be there till midnight tonight.
[02:58:11.164 --> 02:58:12.946]  Central Standard Time on those deals you just heard.
[02:58:12.966 --> 02:58:15.349]  Take advantage of it, or you're insane in my opinion.
[02:58:15.369 --> 02:58:16.090]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:17.752 --> 02:58:19.735]  Ted Anderson, thank you for joining us.
[02:58:19.995 --> 02:58:21.117]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:58:21.417 --> 02:58:22.218]  You bet.
[02:58:22.838 --> 02:58:24.919]  We're going to go into the first hour and second hour today.
[02:58:25.019 --> 02:58:32.264]  I did a devastating analysis of the FEMA camps with the video clips, the documents, the counter to Glenn Beck and his whitewashing while acting like he's a patriot.
[02:58:32.324 --> 02:58:37.207]  Key info coming up in the retransmission right now at InfoWars.com on the audio streams.
[02:58:37.447 --> 02:58:40.529]  We'll be back in 70 seconds, then Burma's 9 to midnight tonight central.
[02:58:40.770 --> 02:58:41.790]  God bless you all.
[02:58:42.070 --> 02:58:45.593]  We'll see you at PrisonPlanet.tv in the Obama deception, March 15th.

[02:58:58.977 --> 02:59:03.619]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:59:03.719 --> 02:59:06.481]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:06.701 --> 02:59:09.542]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:09.742 --> 02:59:14.445]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:14.685 --> 02:59:15.626]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:15.806 --> 02:59:18.768]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:19.048 --> 02:59:25.952]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
