[00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:16.437]  Alright folks, we are simulcasting the last hour and twelve minutes or so today at PrisonPlanet.tv and I want to play a few video clips here now and analyze them and break them down.
[00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:19.959]  We come back from break, all of Obama's major surrogates
[00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.661]  Axelrod and others.
[00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:30.826]  The White House Chief of Staff, of course as well, Rahm Emanuel, are on TV this Sunday saying, we never said we weren't going to raise taxes on everybody.
[00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:31.846]  We have to.
[00:00:32.247 --> 00:00:35.069]  Carbon taxes, health care taxes, income taxes.
[00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.451]  If you make more than $30,000 a year, we're going to raise your taxes.
[00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:40.336]  We never made that pledge.
[00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:42.377]  You were delusional.
[00:00:42.437 --> 00:00:43.378]  You never heard that.
[00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:45.099]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:00:45.619 --> 00:01:01.630]  Also, Obama said that he was never going to shut down the regular health care system, that it's crazy, that there's no plan to federalize things and have national health care.
[00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.254]  But the bill says that and does that, so I want to go over
[00:01:08.624 --> 00:01:17.686]  Some of the facts and what this plan really does versus what Obama is saying coming up after this quick break.
[00:01:17.706 --> 00:01:20.526]  But the first thing we're going to play is his lie.
[00:01:21.587 --> 00:01:24.247]  Here is Obama going back on the lie, though.
[00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:30.828]  This is him a year and a half ago admitting they're going to get rid of regular insurance and take over, but now he's lying and saying he never said this.
[00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.549]  You decide which Obama to believe.
[00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.949]  Here he is.
[00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:40.138]  Evidence Obama and the Dems' healthcare goal is government-public option.
[00:01:40.578 --> 00:01:45.962]  The public option is not your enemy, it is your friend, I believe.
[00:01:46.843 --> 00:01:58.691]  Let me also address a illegitimate concern that's being put forward by those who are claiming that a public option is somehow a Trojan horse for a single-payer system.
[00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:04.876]  My commitment is to make sure that we've got universal healthcare for all Americans by the end of my first term as president.
[00:02:06.387 --> 00:02:19.501]  I would hope that we can set up a system that allows those who can go through their employer to access a federal system or a state pool of some sort.
[00:02:21.163 --> 00:02:23.845]  Obama admitting the plan will eliminate private insurance.
[00:02:24.902 --> 00:02:28.005]  But I don't think we're going to be able to eliminate employer coverage immediately.
[00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:31.307]  There's going to be potentially some transition process.
[00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:35.330]  I can envision a decade out, or 15 years out, or 20 years out.
[00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.714]  I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care plan.
[00:02:39.754 --> 00:02:42.256]  A single-payer health care plan.
[00:02:42.576 --> 00:02:43.537]  Universal health care plan.
[00:02:43.677 --> 00:02:45.178]  And that's what I'd like to see.
[00:02:45.618 --> 00:02:50.502]  I think if we get a good public option, it could lead to single-payer, and that's the best way to reach single-payer.
[00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:54.345]  And next to me was a guy from the insurance company.
[00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:56.276]  Okay, there you have it.
[00:02:56.316 --> 00:03:00.059]  They go on and on admitting what they're doing, but now they lie to you.
[00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.120]  These are criminals.
[00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:07.025]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:10.968]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:14.731]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:22.517]  At less than two cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:22.837]  I think so.

[00:04:04.224 --> 00:04:09.549]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:17.056]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:04:17.636 --> 00:04:23.802]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.042]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:28.603]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:04:28.683 --> 00:04:39.625]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:04:40.265 --> 00:04:41.545]  It's not about left or right.
[00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:43.286]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:50.027]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:58.472]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:58.973 --> 00:05:00.135]  The Obama Deception.
[00:05:00.556 --> 00:05:01.718]  The people strike back!
[00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.992]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:06.634]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:05:06.934 --> 00:05:09.156]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:05:09.597 --> 00:05:14.362]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:17.606]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:21.470]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[00:05:40.934 --> 00:05:43.555]  And storing five gallon bottles of water in your home.

[00:06:08.575 --> 00:06:10.395]  Okay, so there you have it.
[00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:12.736]  Getting rid of employers.
[00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:32.810]  Gathering the money, running the system.
[00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.811]  Your paycheck money will go to the government.
[00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:37.992]  They'll keep it, give it to offshore banks.
[00:06:38.453 --> 00:06:40.354]  And when you have a heart attack, they'll give you an aspirin.
[00:06:40.974 --> 00:06:42.154]  That's socialized healthcare.
[00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:50.078]  Where all the services are to pay taxes to offshore banks, who made up the fiat currency to begin with.
[00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:53.060]  That's all this is.
[00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:58.663]  And if you go over the healthcare bill, page by page,
[00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:02.493]  You'll be required to take the government option.
[00:07:02.533 --> 00:07:03.373]  Page 16.
[00:07:04.034 --> 00:07:07.476]  Mandates audits of all employers that self-insure.
[00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:14.020]  So then the push is for employers just to stop giving you insurance.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.061]  Page 30.
[00:07:15.421 --> 00:07:18.483]  Government committee will decide what treatments and benefits you get.
[00:07:18.843 --> 00:07:21.345]  And unlike an insurer, there will be no appeals process.
[00:07:21.565 --> 00:07:22.925]  Yeah, there's no liability here.
[00:07:23.866 --> 00:07:25.087]  Government health care is hellish.
[00:07:27.782 --> 00:07:29.523]  I always run into these idiots in the U.S.
[00:07:29.543 --> 00:07:35.008]  who think it's great that you meet a Brit, or you meet a German, or you meet somebody from Canada and they're like, it's horrible!
[00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.732]  The Health Choice Commissioner will decide health benefits for you.
[00:07:41.213 --> 00:07:42.614]  You will have no choice, none.
[00:07:42.674 --> 00:07:42.914]  Page 42.
[00:07:43.154 --> 00:07:44.475]  You can go read the bill.
[00:07:45.076 --> 00:07:45.656]  I checked this.
[00:07:46.277 --> 00:07:46.537]  Page 50.
[00:07:47.118 --> 00:07:47.858]  All non-U.S.
[00:07:47.878 --> 00:07:51.881]  citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services.
[00:07:52.702 --> 00:07:56.205]  That'll bring more tens of millions of illegals to further bankrupt the country.
[00:07:57.506 --> 00:07:59.007]  I mean, we can't pay for the whole world.
[00:07:59.067 --> 00:07:59.787]  Sorry, folks!
[00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:03.228]  Every person will be issued a National ID health card.
[00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:05.109]  That's your National ID card.
[00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:07.670]  Just like Social Security was used to set that up.
[00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:15.133]  Federal government will have direct, real-time access to all individual bank accounts for electronic funds transfer.
[00:08:15.493 --> 00:08:21.075]  That's just like some of the Scandinavian countries where they automatically just take money out of everybody's accounts.
[00:08:21.496 --> 00:08:23.516]  Everything's moving towards this cashless society.
[00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:24.377]  It's hellish.
[00:08:25.464 --> 00:08:28.385]  This is the total federal takeover, the global takeover.
[00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:34.526]  Taxpayers will subsidize all union, retiree, and community organizer health plans.
[00:08:35.527 --> 00:08:40.348]  All private health care plans must conform to government rules to participate in a health care exchange.
[00:08:40.828 --> 00:08:43.889]  All private health care plans must participate in a health care exchange.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.700]  Page 91.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.342]  Government mandates, linguistic infrastructure for services, translation, illegal aliens.
[00:08:51.763 --> 00:08:52.623]  Page 95.
[00:08:52.663 --> 00:08:57.325]  The government will pay ACORN and AmeriCorps to sign up individuals for government-run health care plan.
[00:08:57.945 --> 00:09:00.846]  Those eligible for Medicaid will be automatically enrolled.
[00:09:01.066 --> 00:09:02.206]  You have no choice in the matter.
[00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:03.807]  Page 124.
[00:09:03.887 --> 00:09:06.368]  No company can sue the government for price fixing.
[00:09:06.408 --> 00:09:09.229]  No judicial review is permitted against the government monopoly.
[00:09:09.429 --> 00:09:11.290]  Put simply, private insurers will be crushed.
[00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.570]  I mean, I went and read the bill.
[00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:13.891]  I didn't just believe this when I read it.
[00:09:14.511 --> 00:09:15.152]  Page 127.
[00:09:15.713 --> 00:09:17.416]  The AMA sold doctors out.
[00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:18.779]  The government will set wages.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.801]  Now, the good news is, nobody's buying this.
[00:09:24.362 --> 00:09:26.983]  Everywhere congressmen go, this is South Austin.
[00:09:27.263 --> 00:09:32.226]  This was at a meeting a mile and a half from where I sit, Saturday.
[00:09:32.686 --> 00:09:43.051]  Here is Lloyd Doggett being completely booed and shouted down by his liberal, most liberal area of Texas is Austin, the most liberal area of Austin is South Austin.
[00:09:44.612 --> 00:09:43.051]  78704.
[00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:47.474]  Now this is what the liberals think of it.
[00:09:47.514 --> 00:09:47.854]  Here it is.
[00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.633]  And then Lloyd Doggett cowardly runs out of the building.
[00:10:17.553 --> 00:10:19.515]  Look at him.
[00:10:20.135 --> 00:10:22.877]  I mean, he goes on and on.
[00:10:23.097 --> 00:10:26.260]  There he is being chased outside.
[00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:29.702]  I mean, Lloyd Doggett is running.
[00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:36.930]  This is the most socialistic, communistic area of Texas.
[00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.591]  And they're not buying any of it, pal.
[00:10:40.611 --> 00:10:43.152]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds.
[00:10:45.752 --> 00:10:48.113]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:10:53.479 --> 00:10:58.663]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:03.166]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:11:03.306 --> 00:11:05.168]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:11:05.588 --> 00:11:06.949]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:08.250]  There is a solution.
[00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:16.493]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:11:58.949 --> 00:12:01.750]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:08.018]  Just say no!
[00:12:08.758 --> 00:12:11.560]  Just say no to socialized healthcare!
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:22.606]  The incredible part about this is the Democrats lie and say none of this socialization, none of this eugenics, none of this rationing is in the bill, when it's all in the bill!
[00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:25.367]  We've seen the exact... it's the British model.
[00:12:27.308 --> 00:12:28.349]  We're just phasing it in.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:37.163]  And there is Lloyd Doggett with his favorite constituents being chased out of the meeting hall, outside, running for his car.
[00:12:39.124 --> 00:12:46.787]  Because he doesn't want to be in front of the news cameras, showing the people not going along with him.
[00:12:49.287 --> 00:12:50.408]  Now ladies and gentlemen,
[00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.997]  The globalists are slowly conditioning us to accept their police state, their tyranny.
[00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:58.361]  They said 9-11 was about Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:01.626]  The police state was only for guys in caves with turbines.
[00:13:02.864 --> 00:13:08.211]  We always explain to you folks that it was designed North Com Homeland Security for the American people.
[00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:11.054]  TSA on the streets of America.
[00:13:11.094 --> 00:13:12.776]  They're now on the streets of America.
[00:13:13.136 --> 00:13:21.987]  Checkpoints, body scanners, face scanning cameras, DHS reports, gun owners, conservatives, veterans are the number one threat.
[00:13:22.908 --> 00:13:30.892]  The whole system is designed for people that aren't going to go along with the New World Order and the socialized health care and the carbon tax and turning our guns in.
[00:13:31.212 --> 00:13:34.034]  They tell us that socialized health care isn't that.
[00:13:34.094 --> 00:13:34.814]  We can read the bill.
[00:13:34.834 --> 00:13:35.614]  We know they're liars.
[00:13:35.914 --> 00:13:40.357]  They say they don't want our guns when they've got the most draconian anti-gun bills ever introduced.
[00:13:40.777 --> 00:13:45.399]  Introduced when the Attorney General argued in federal court for a complete gun ban in D.C.
[00:13:45.439 --> 00:13:46.059]  versus Heller.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.661]  He was the government's lawyer just last year.
[00:13:49.645 --> 00:13:51.005]  We know they're panicking.
[00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:54.747]  We know that they know that we know that they're criminals.
[00:13:55.327 --> 00:13:55.827]  You understand?
[00:13:55.927 --> 00:13:57.708]  They know that we know that they're criminals.
[00:13:58.108 --> 00:14:00.669]  They know that we're waking up.
[00:14:01.429 --> 00:14:12.313]  And so they always want to make their own slaves first live under tyranny, their own minions, so their minions will then say, well I live under tyranny, you should have to live under tyranny.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.622]  And so some of the most oppressed people are the police and the military and others.
[00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:21.004]  And that's why in Mexico they make the federales take microchips.
[00:14:21.184 --> 00:14:23.345]  Source ABC News, MSNBC.
[00:14:24.878 --> 00:14:27.559]  That's why they're trying to push the special forces to get chips.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.280]  Many units have already gotten them.
[00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:32.182]  And that's why they want to make federal workers take chips.
[00:14:32.402 --> 00:14:36.324]  They want to make them take the inoculations first, so they'll then force us to take it.
[00:14:36.544 --> 00:14:37.925]  The good news is they're saying no.
[00:14:38.305 --> 00:14:47.470]  They tried to tell TSA two years ago, we heard about this from sources, it's now been confirmed, that they were telling TSA, will you take a chip to keep your job?
[00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.912]  But not just TSA, the mechanics.
[00:14:51.032 --> 00:14:56.797]  The food preparers, if you work at Monja, at the Austin Airport, or at the Salt Lake, you gotta take a chip.
[00:14:57.658 --> 00:14:59.299]  This is really being proposed.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.884]  Here is San Antonio Mainstream TV, KENS.
[00:15:04.944 --> 00:15:05.365]  Here it is.
[00:15:08.003 --> 00:15:09.164]  ...random bag checks.
[00:15:09.244 --> 00:15:13.645]  As passengers, we've come to expect tight security measures associated with flying.
[00:15:14.105 --> 00:15:18.927]  Soon those measures will extend beyond those just taking off to include those who never leave the airport.
[00:15:19.327 --> 00:15:28.070]  San Antonio international officials tell KENS 5 Congress is putting into motion measures that will ensure airport employees are subject to stricter security checks.
[00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.172]  Selena Hernandez joins us live from the airport with a KENS 5 exclusive.
[00:15:32.192 --> 00:15:32.452]  Selena?
[00:15:33.237 --> 00:15:38.561]  Chris, right now all airport employees must pass a police and FBI background check soon.
[00:15:39.001 --> 00:15:42.524]  Those checks could include something a little more intrusive.
[00:15:45.203 --> 00:15:51.651]  At San Antonio International Airport, officials here await the arrival of stricter security measures.
[00:15:52.672 --> 00:15:56.156]  Not for passengers, rather airport employees.
[00:15:56.376 --> 00:16:00.981]  This would be a huge step as far as the amount of background checks that we're going through.
[00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:04.726]  This would kind of open it up to a lot of different areas that we don't currently have in place.
[00:16:04.986 --> 00:16:18.616]  Members of Congress are currently debating how to keep closer tabs on those who have access to secured areas, meaning everyone from restaurant employees to airline mechanics could soon be subjected to more rigorous background checks.
[00:16:18.897 --> 00:16:21.539]  We're just kind of waiting to see what they come up with.
[00:16:21.659 --> 00:16:23.040]  It's fairly early in the process.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:39.456]  Under discussion, a check of an employee's credit history, search of their bags and property before entering secured areas, and perhaps the most extreme measure, the use of biometric readers for fingerprints and eyes, even possibly a chip implant.
[00:16:40.357 --> 00:16:43.520]  An idea we're told more than likely won't fly.
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.806]  Before they ever got to the chip in the hand or anything like that, we feel like they would probably opt for... Alright, that's enough.
[00:16:49.547 --> 00:16:55.615]  See, to make face scanning sound okay, they say, okay, we won't make you take a chip, but we want you to face scan.
[00:16:56.055 --> 00:17:00.982]  And then, oh, you gotta have a chip, but don't worry, it's not the tracker kind.
[00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:02.403]  See, it's incremental.
[00:17:03.456 --> 00:17:07.438]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:17:07.698 --> 00:17:09.479]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:17.983]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:17:18.223 --> 00:17:23.445]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:17:23.765 --> 00:17:25.386]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:17:25.626 --> 00:17:31.971]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:42.898]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:17:43.198 --> 00:17:43.719]  That's right.
[00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:46.280]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:17:46.541 --> 00:17:48.122]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:17:50.043 --> 00:17:50.683]  We're good to go.
[00:18:03.407 --> 00:18:04.508]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:06.571]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:18:06.791 --> 00:18:07.452]  Well, you should.
[00:18:07.752 --> 00:18:12.017]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:12.758]  That's right.
[00:18:13.058 --> 00:18:21.508]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:18:21.728 --> 00:18:22.969]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:18:23.089 --> 00:18:24.231]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:18:24.431 --> 00:18:30.054]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:18:30.414 --> 00:18:36.938]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:18:37.298 --> 00:18:42.501]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:43.961]  This is real.
[00:18:44.282 --> 00:18:45.042]  Don't miss out.
[00:18:45.342 --> 00:18:52.206]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:18:52.446 --> 00:18:53.708]  And get your free handgun.
[00:18:53.888 --> 00:18:56.071]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:18:56.252 --> 00:18:59.777]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:18:59.957 --> 00:19:02.881]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.360]  ...named M.Z.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.581]  in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:19:07.801 --> 00:19:10.202]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:19:10.362 --> 00:19:19.905]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life, that even when you do a great job for someone, and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:25.927]  You are always in danger of losing your job, unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:19:26.227 --> 00:19:28.748]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:19:28.928 --> 00:19:29.748]  So M.Z.
[00:19:29.788 --> 00:19:31.309]  has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[00:19:32.429 --> 00:19:32.629]  We're good.
[00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:56.470]  OwnMyself.com.
[00:19:56.631 --> 00:19:57.692]  It takes very little money.
[00:19:57.812 --> 00:20:00.234]  And if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[00:20:00.414 --> 00:20:02.956]  Remember, Chocolate.OwnMyself.com.
[00:20:04.057 --> 00:20:09.182]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:09.483 --> 00:20:11.745]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:24.698]  So I just finished up playing the clip on San Antonio TV where the feds are proposing making airport workers take implantable microchips.
[00:20:25.699 --> 00:20:26.820]  This is really going on.
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:32.925]  And they just keep repeating it and repeating it and repeating it until we just get acclimated and go, okay, where's my chip?
[00:20:32.945 --> 00:20:34.367]  I've been hearing about this for 10 years.
[00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:38.370]  Coming up, I want to play a clip.
[00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:42.374]  Government issues stun bracelets for all airline passengers.
[00:20:42.794 --> 00:20:55.505]  Now we first played this a year and a half ago, but the issue is Homeland Security since then has had meetings and has proposed making risky flyers.
[00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:58.568]  And then later everyone, see they phase it in,
[00:21:00.202 --> 00:21:01.903]  Take a taser bracelet.
[00:21:02.744 --> 00:21:06.887]  And they're saying if you have bad credit, you're now a risky flyer in the data mining.
[00:21:06.907 --> 00:21:09.609]  I mean, you can't make up stuff this bizarre.
[00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:20.517]  Now, Aaron Dykes and Jason Burmess, I sent them up to interview Phil Berg in Philadelphia.
[00:21:21.358 --> 00:21:23.400]  And they were flying back in Philadelphia.
[00:21:24.841 --> 00:21:28.804]  They were announcing on big TV screens, while you're in line at TSA,
[00:21:31.684 --> 00:21:44.381]  I guess you get them in here about it, about how you're going to have family travelers, expert travelers, infrequent travelers, and you get searched accordingly, so they're already getting you ready for the yellow stars, the different groups.
[00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:49.627]  Oh, we don't profile all of you are slaves, but we profile what group you're in.
[00:21:50.598 --> 00:21:56.701]  And then you get used to being asked questions and being prodded and being searched and taking your shoes off and all these acts of submission.
[00:21:57.062 --> 00:21:58.983]  And then, oh, you get a taser bracelet.
[00:21:59.363 --> 00:22:02.144]  Oh, you go in the body scanner that scans your naked body.
[00:22:02.165 --> 00:22:02.905]  They already have those.
[00:22:03.805 --> 00:22:05.126]  And they record your naked body.
[00:22:06.627 --> 00:22:07.808]  It's acts of submission.
[00:22:08.088 --> 00:22:09.989]  Now TSA is going to be on the streets of America.
[00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.709]  It's already begun.
[00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:13.311]  This is the phasing in of the tyranny.
[00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:15.232]  This is all psychologically being done.
[00:22:16.641 --> 00:22:18.362]  Attorney Phil Berg joins us.
[00:22:18.402 --> 00:22:23.925]  He is the progenitor, the starter, of the whole questioning of Obama's birth certificate.
[00:22:24.586 --> 00:22:26.887]  He's the first person to file a lawsuit in conjunction with it.
[00:22:28.168 --> 00:22:38.714]  And we called him yesterday when WorldNetDaily broke this big story about a prominent lawyer, Alan Keyes' lawyer, putting out this Kenyan certificate of live birth.
[00:22:38.794 --> 00:22:40.695]  Not a birth certificate, but a similar
[00:22:42.483 --> 00:22:45.745]  certificate of live birth to what Obama is showing.
[00:22:45.785 --> 00:22:47.326]  Not his birth certificate, but his certificate.
[00:22:48.186 --> 00:22:50.467]  And there's been some anomalies in that.
[00:22:50.847 --> 00:23:07.036]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, who we got coming on Friday, he's looking at it and he's calling Hawaii and filing things and Hawaii won't give him the documents, won't even say where Obama's camp got the certificate of live birth.
[00:23:07.396 --> 00:23:08.457]  In fact, guys, will you put that
[00:23:09.682 --> 00:23:10.902]  Latest story up on screen.
[00:23:11.162 --> 00:23:22.006]  Here it is, Hawaii refuses to verify President's online COLB's, official's mom, on images released by Obama's campaign, factcheck.org.
[00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:23.686]  It's basically run by George Soros.
[00:23:24.726 --> 00:23:26.567]  Another one of his little fake groups out there.
[00:23:27.027 --> 00:23:30.068]  So we'll be breaking all that down.
[00:23:31.044 --> 00:23:33.207]  But, uh, where there's smoke, there's fire.
[00:23:33.227 --> 00:23:34.628]  I mean, they are acting very suspicious.
[00:23:34.648 --> 00:23:39.013]  They are stonewalling and saying, you've seen his original birth certificate when it isn't.
[00:23:39.374 --> 00:23:42.578]  They've stonewalled and said his name isn't Barry Sotero when it comes out.
[00:23:42.878 --> 00:23:44.540]  That is one of his little fake names.
[00:23:45.661 --> 00:23:47.363]  Uh, this is a very sneaky guy.
[00:23:48.024 --> 00:23:52.726]  With a mama who worked for Tim Geithner's dad at Big Foundations, his dad an open communist.
[00:23:53.146 --> 00:23:54.806]  I mean, these are very sickening people.
[00:23:55.607 --> 00:23:57.227]  And so nothing he says should be believed.
[00:23:57.247 --> 00:23:59.828]  He's now announced that he's going to raise taxes on the middle class.
[00:24:00.168 --> 00:24:02.669]  His office is announcing it.
[00:24:03.931 --> 00:24:05.972]  I mean, just everything's been a lie.
[00:24:06.733 --> 00:24:08.774]  His father, you know, was mainly Arab.
[00:24:08.794 --> 00:24:10.335]  He's not even really the first black president.
[00:24:10.355 --> 00:24:11.496]  He's the first Arab president.
[00:24:11.816 --> 00:24:12.837]  I'm not saying Arabs are bad.
[00:24:12.877 --> 00:24:13.477]  That's fine.
[00:24:14.017 --> 00:24:19.060]  It's everything with Barack Obama is a lie, just like everything with Hillary is a lie.
[00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:27.326]  Attorney Phil Berg, you've now had 24 hours to look at all these new revelations coming out of kind of the other
[00:24:28.268 --> 00:24:29.088]  Birther Camp.
[00:24:29.569 --> 00:24:31.189]  You are the original Birther Camp.
[00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.952]  You know, I'm glad everybody's researching this and looking at it, whatever the truth is.
[00:24:35.972 --> 00:24:38.393]  You know, there is obviously something substantive here.
[00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:42.274]  The way the Obamanoids are behaving, so scared.
[00:24:43.035 --> 00:24:46.897]  And this thing is building to a crescendo.
[00:24:47.357 --> 00:24:50.858]  When is the cacophony going to reach its peak?
[00:24:50.898 --> 00:24:53.660]  I mean, this gets bigger and bigger by the millisecond.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.200]  Phil Berg.
[00:24:54.906 --> 00:24:55.306]  Well, thank you.
[00:24:55.366 --> 00:24:57.627]  It is getting bigger and bigger by each day.
[00:24:58.108 --> 00:25:08.353]  And I think it's going to get bigger during this next month because Congress is going home now, and they're going to have to meet with their, you know, normally vacation, but they also meet with their constituents.
[00:25:08.953 --> 00:25:20.979]  And not only is this health fiasco going to be brought up, the stimulus package, you know, which hasn't gone the way it was supposed to, but now as we've seen with Congressman Kassel, people are going to ask questions about the birth certificate.
[00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:23.781]  I think it's going to grow and grow and grow from now through Labor Day.
[00:25:24.301 --> 00:25:24.862]  I think so.
[00:25:37.435 --> 00:25:37.915]  Questions.
[00:25:38.375 --> 00:25:40.116]  We have circumstantial evidence.
[00:25:40.176 --> 00:25:41.136]  We don't have the hardcore.
[00:25:41.156 --> 00:25:45.378]  We have a lot of circumstantial evidence that Obama was born not in Hawaii.
[00:25:45.438 --> 00:25:46.438]  He was born in Kenya.
[00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:52.440]  I mean, just the biggest fact is that Obama will not release any documentation regarding his life.
[00:25:52.981 --> 00:25:53.701]  We know nothing.
[00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:54.161]  Think about it.
[00:25:54.181 --> 00:25:55.301]  We know nothing about him.
[00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:59.603]  And what we do know about him, the various stories, like even where he met his wife.
[00:26:00.203 --> 00:26:01.064]  He lied about that.
[00:26:01.084 --> 00:26:03.828]  I mean, he lied about his job when he was at Columbia.
[00:26:04.228 --> 00:26:11.978]  He's lied about everything, and you're right, now they're talking about tax increase, but his press secretary was just the one saying, no, no, no, he's not going to raise taxes.
[00:26:12.199 --> 00:26:16.364]  In a baloney, as you don't look at him closely, he's doing everything he possibly can.
[00:26:18.346 --> 00:26:21.787]  Well, I mean, that's always his tactic, is slippery, oily deceit.
[00:26:22.067 --> 00:26:28.869]  He has Axelrod and Emanuel running around saying, yeah, well, he never quite pledged.
[00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:30.370]  I mean, we may have to.
[00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.991]  And then he has his other surrogates say, the president's not going to do that.
[00:26:34.031 --> 00:26:39.473]  It's like he always speaks out of both sides of his mouth like no president I've ever seen.
[00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:59.826]  Absolutely, and he's dropped in his polls, and because he's dropping in the polls, more and more people now are going to start looking at him, and they're going to start realizing, they're going to hear about this birth certificate, and they're going to be alarmed, because all of your listeners out there have to produce their birth certificate, sometimes in a lifetime, one to five times, one to ten times,
[00:27:00.206 --> 00:27:01.706]  They need it for a baptism.
[00:27:01.746 --> 00:27:03.467]  They need it to register for Little League.
[00:27:03.707 --> 00:27:05.267]  They definitely need it for a passport.
[00:27:05.287 --> 00:27:10.508]  Sometimes they need it for applications for college, or for various schools, or scholarships, or driver's license.
[00:27:10.548 --> 00:27:11.829]  Different states have different things.
[00:27:12.249 --> 00:27:17.570]  And here Obama won't produce the simple birth certificate, which is really, you know, outrageous.
[00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:19.711]  It really, it's amazing.
[00:27:20.111 --> 00:27:22.951]  And has that added fuel to the fire, Mr. Berg?
[00:27:22.971 --> 00:27:23.191]  Sure.
[00:27:25.612 --> 00:27:34.656]  Because they keep saying, we've given you the birth certificate, we've given you the birth certificate, and everybody knows what their birth certificate looks like versus the certificate.
[00:27:35.356 --> 00:27:39.858]  And people see that's a computer printout, modern certificate.
[00:27:40.178 --> 00:27:44.040]  They can see that it's not the original birth certificate.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:54.224]  And then, like you said, he's been caught lying about everything else, and his name's really Barry Sotero, and all this other weirdness.
[00:27:54.904 --> 00:28:07.430]  Now, where does that bring us to, though, with the other camp, the other birther group, which, you know, I'm neutral on, but we've seen other fake birth certificates come out, not associated with these guys.
[00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.031]  Now, they've got one.
[00:28:09.411 --> 00:28:11.952]  Some people, like Mike Rivera, who I respect,
[00:28:12.552 --> 00:28:18.153]  Early indications are that it's a phony, but I don't want to comment completely on that.
[00:28:18.173 --> 00:28:20.774]  We gave it to our expert, but we're looking at it.
[00:28:20.814 --> 00:28:21.474]  There's different things.
[00:28:38.437 --> 00:28:42.418]  Because the status of the Republic of Kenya changed during that time.
[00:28:43.118 --> 00:28:45.359]  Was it, you know, who was it?
[00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:45.799]  A British?
[00:28:45.819 --> 00:28:46.719]  What was it?
[00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:48.419]  When was the form changed?
[00:28:48.459 --> 00:28:49.199]  And all that kind of stuff.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.360]  And we're getting a lot of questions in here.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.380]  It looks real.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.500]  It looks real.
[00:28:53.981 --> 00:28:56.601]  But, you know, we have to check other documents at that time.
[00:28:57.061 --> 00:28:57.941]  And I don't want to knock it.
[00:28:58.462 --> 00:29:03.963]  If it turns out to be real, I'm wonderful and I'll give the blessing for the other attorney who I don't see eye to eye on.
[00:29:05.542 --> 00:29:18.107]  What she did is she filed it as part of her court case, the Alan Keyes case in California, and she's asked the court to grant her a special motion so that she can check the authenticity of the document.
[00:29:18.507 --> 00:29:20.588]  That's not how I do things.
[00:29:21.128 --> 00:29:24.050]  We've gotten several birth certificates over this past year.
[00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.730]  We've paid for some of them.
[00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.551]  They've turned up to be phony.
[00:29:27.911 --> 00:29:29.192]  Have I posted any of them?
[00:29:29.492 --> 00:29:29.712]  No.
[00:29:29.792 --> 00:29:30.212]  Why not?
[00:29:30.572 --> 00:29:34.594]  Because I feel that we have to, and we have with Obamacrimes.com, our website.
[00:29:35.194 --> 00:29:35.815]  Excuse me.
[00:29:35.875 --> 00:29:37.797]  We've stayed very straight and narrow here.
[00:29:38.277 --> 00:29:40.600]  We have three lawsuits pending in federal court.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:47.006]  We're not playing games because we want people to be assured that when I say something, it means something.
[00:29:47.046 --> 00:29:51.590]  So I can't, I don't want to say it's, it's definitely, I'm not going to say it's good now, but I don't want to say it's bad.
[00:29:51.891 --> 00:29:56.495]  But there's indications now by certain things on that document that we've been reading about.
[00:29:56.535 --> 00:29:57.817]  We're all reading about it on the internet.
[00:29:58.477 --> 00:30:19.718]  Indications here that it's phony and I just hope if it is that we can talk to people like through your station and allow me to speak and say let's not take this as a setback let's just move on you know because we don't know like for all we know think about it Obama's people could have been out put it out as a phony document looking good to try to discredit us because
[00:30:19.778 --> 00:30:22.180]  Well, I mean, that's a classic government trick.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:31.288]  Karl Rove has been caught repeatedly when somebody's on his tail, throwing out fake documents that incriminate himself to then discredit the whole story.
[00:30:31.568 --> 00:30:33.410]  He got caught doing that with Dan Rather.
[00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:43.498]  And the whole situation with Bush and the Air National Guard, which we know Bush was AWOL, that was later proven correct, but all people remember was Dan Rather getting in trouble.
[00:30:43.518 --> 00:30:45.480]  And I'm no fan of Dan Rather, just facts are facts.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:50.306]  No, but I agree that Bush was AWOL and they just tried to frame him up on that document.
[00:30:50.947 --> 00:30:51.488]  And you're right.
[00:30:51.728 --> 00:30:53.030]  But wait a minute.
[00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.312]  How can we say this, Alex?
[00:30:54.812 --> 00:30:58.898]  I mean, Obama, the transparent president, he wouldn't do anything phony, would he?
[00:31:00.069 --> 00:31:16.636]  Well absolutely, I mean them to say that, I mean with all the weird, he lived all over the world and a lot of foggy stuff, well now they're asking how did this certificate of live birth get to fact check and Hawaii won't say.
[00:31:17.056 --> 00:31:19.057]  So they're acting suspicious, what do you think of that?
[00:31:19.637 --> 00:31:21.498]  Of the original document or this document?
[00:31:21.954 --> 00:31:25.157]  Uh, no, no, no, the, uh, yes, yes, the original certificate.
[00:31:25.197 --> 00:31:25.658]  The original one?
[00:31:25.978 --> 00:31:40.713]  Yeah, well, the original one was supposedly, at first, if you would think about it, everyone, June 2008, it first came out on the Obama campaign website, and then Fact Check came in several months later to check the authenticity of it, and they came back and said it's valid.
[00:31:41.408 --> 00:31:46.053]  I think that's the most damning thing, is that no one was questioning his birth in the U.S.
[00:31:46.093 --> 00:31:47.314]  Nobody even thought about him.
[00:31:47.735 --> 00:31:50.177]  Why would they, early on, push that out there?
[00:31:50.458 --> 00:31:52.460]  Phil, I think that's the most damning evidence against him.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:57.525]  I want to ask you, in the final segment with you, when we get back, what your take is on that, and where you think all of this is going.
[00:31:58.646 --> 00:32:01.970]  Also, look at some of the problems with this new birth certificate.
[00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:02.650]  Stay with us.

[00:32:45.876 --> 00:32:46.216]  I think so.
[00:33:04.665 --> 00:33:09.991]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:33:10.472 --> 00:33:17.480]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:33:18.061 --> 00:33:24.228]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:33:24.648 --> 00:33:26.489]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:29.030]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:40.054]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:33:40.694 --> 00:33:41.974]  It's not about left or right.
[00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:43.715]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:33:44.235 --> 00:33:48.597]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told.
[00:33:49.233 --> 00:33:50.576]  And his real agenda.

[00:34:14.942 --> 00:34:20.671]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[00:34:20.891 --> 00:34:29.220]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers, and I'm mild attracted to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.203]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.

[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.123]  Most Americans know the significance of July 4th, 1776.
[00:35:08.685 --> 00:35:16.455]  However, few know the importance of September 17th, 1787, the day the Constitution was written and adopted by our founders.
[00:35:16.796 --> 00:35:23.224]  Unfortunately, over 200 years later, this sacred document is under attack, along with our beloved Republic.
[00:35:23.444 --> 00:35:30.127]  Throughout the span of history, brave men and women have rallied behind banners which have served as symbols of liberty against the forces of tyranny.

[00:36:06.579 --> 00:36:12.623]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:36:13.224 --> 00:36:16.246]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36:24.191 --> 00:36:26.212]  Bill Byrd, where do you see all this going?
[00:36:27.773 --> 00:36:29.495]  No president has dropped this fast.
[00:36:30.055 --> 00:36:32.537]  He just keeps dropping a couple points every week.
[00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:40.454]  I don't see Obama and the criminals that run him being able to continue their gutting of the nation unless they stage something.
[00:36:40.934 --> 00:36:42.675]  And I've had Ron Paul on last week.
[00:36:42.715 --> 00:36:49.419]  He's coming on Wednesday again saying that he believes they may stage a crisis or a war or an economic collapse.
[00:36:49.439 --> 00:36:52.500]  They may use this flu hysteria as a cover.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.262]  I mean, what are the Obama people going to do?
[00:36:55.862 --> 00:36:58.664]  He is going to be the most unpopular president in U.S.
[00:36:58.724 --> 00:37:01.125]  history at this rate in just two months.
[00:37:01.806 --> 00:37:08.568]  Right, and I think that's going to go hand in hand with the truth coming out that he's constitutionally ineligible to be president.
[00:37:09.068 --> 00:37:13.670]  And once we get the public behind us, and I think we will, because what are we asking for?
[00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:14.790]  Two main things.
[00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:18.632]  Number one, his birth certificate, the vault copy, the true copy of it.
[00:37:19.072 --> 00:37:22.353]  But two, more important is when he was adopted in Indonesia.
[00:37:22.873 --> 00:37:23.753]  Think about one thing.
[00:37:23.873 --> 00:37:31.436]  We have the school record on our website and elsewhere, Obamacrimes.com, that his name is Barry Sotoro and his nationality is Indonesia.
[00:37:32.373 --> 00:37:38.197]  I would like to see where he has legally changed his name back to Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:37:38.257 --> 00:37:46.583]  Because if he hasn't legally changed his name, think about it, every state where he signed Barack Hussein Obama to run for president, that was fraud.
[00:37:46.843 --> 00:37:48.504]  See, that's a whole nother issue.
[00:37:48.544 --> 00:37:48.724]  Right.
[00:37:48.944 --> 00:37:56.709]  He went and got adopted by a Muslim family, went to Madrasas, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but then he said, oh, that's ridiculous, I have no Muslim roots.
[00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:59.751]  Then he goes to Cairo and says, I'm a Muslim, basically.
[00:38:00.152 --> 00:38:02.013]  This guy is a chameleon.
[00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:04.073]  I don't think he's any of these things.
[00:38:04.233 --> 00:38:06.074]  We probably don't even know what his real name is.
[00:38:06.794 --> 00:38:07.894]  Well, that's good.
[00:38:08.174 --> 00:38:08.654]  But you're right.
[00:38:08.734 --> 00:38:10.995]  During the campaign, I'm not a Muslim.
[00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:13.255]  Now that he's President, I'm a Muslim.
[00:38:13.615 --> 00:38:17.356]  I love the fact that during the campaign, how dare you use my middle name?
[00:38:17.756 --> 00:38:18.776]  Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:21.476]  You had to call him Barack H. Obama or Barack Obama.
[00:38:21.936 --> 00:38:27.357]  As soon as he got elected, when it came time to be sworn in, and it came out a few weeks earlier, what did he tell everyone?
[00:38:27.697 --> 00:38:30.898]  I want to be sworn in under my name of Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:38:31.298 --> 00:38:33.320]  I mean, this guy is a phony from day one.
[00:38:34.001 --> 00:38:46.572]  But the big thing, think about it, if we can't get him on the birth certificate right now, if we can't get, if he hasn't legally changed his name, his name Barry Sotoro, and he's committed fraud ever since leaving,
[00:38:47.132 --> 00:38:48.653]  Indonesia, using the name.
[00:38:48.933 --> 00:38:53.576]  Now, it might not be in Columbia, but when he was at Dock Sedona in California, everyone called him Barry.
[00:38:53.977 --> 00:38:56.478]  I think his legal name today is Barry Soturo.
[00:38:56.999 --> 00:39:00.161]  And remember what happened with Watergate.
[00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:02.702]  The Watergate break-in with Nixon was no big deal.
[00:39:03.042 --> 00:39:03.923]  It was a cover-up.
[00:39:04.283 --> 00:39:08.366]  And now we're in a massive cover-up, I believe, by Obama and the people around him.
[00:39:08.886 --> 00:39:21.421]  And I think that's where we're going to get them because they had hoped, you asked why they brought this up, I got involved August 2008, a year ago now, but in June of 2008 they put this on the website.
[00:39:21.481 --> 00:39:28.449]  The reason they did, it had been circulating on the website for a year before that to try to quell the rumors that were going around.
[00:39:28.989 --> 00:39:31.050]  That's why they put this false document up.
[00:39:31.431 --> 00:39:34.393]  But they're such idiots because they put such a phony document up.
[00:39:34.473 --> 00:39:38.495]  If they took time to preparing a better one, maybe we wouldn't be talking about it today.
[00:39:38.535 --> 00:39:43.098]  Well, lastly, people kept saying, we want to see a birth announcement.
[00:39:43.158 --> 00:39:46.661]  But if a family wants their child to be able to claim U.S.
[00:39:46.701 --> 00:39:57.147]  citizen down the road, and they're born in the country, that's very common to fly back and then put a birth announcement in, and then put out a fake birth certificate, especially back in the 60s.
[00:39:58.468 --> 00:40:04.295]  So I don't think this silences some supposed microfilm on some establishment website.
[00:40:04.315 --> 00:40:05.476]  What do you say to that, Phil Berg?
[00:40:05.756 --> 00:40:10.461]  Yeah, no, the two announcements in the newspapers there, that doesn't really bother me.
[00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:11.082]  I'll tell you why.
[00:40:11.102 --> 00:40:13.585]  Like, for instance, my son lives in a different state.
[00:40:14.285 --> 00:40:16.587]  And he had a child till my granddaughter was born.
[00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:30.515]  I could have put an announcement here in Philadelphia, you know, and I could have used my address or any address, and it turned out the address they used isn't even a legitimate address because the people living next door who's lived there for the last 50 years said there was never a black child living next door.
[00:40:30.975 --> 00:40:35.258]  So, to me, that's just another, that's, they're saying that's great evidence.
[00:40:35.858 --> 00:40:39.981]  Also, I mean, also, these people are intelligence agents.
[00:40:40.202 --> 00:40:59.817]  I mean, you've got this spooky, you know, cover-up that has been going on this entire time, where they're acting all sneaky, and nobody's allowed to ask questions, and his dad is a communist, and his mother works for these big, creepy, spooky foundations, and Geithner's dad.
[00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:02.479]  I mean, this guy gets scarier and scarier by the minute.
[00:41:03.063 --> 00:41:08.984]  Absolutely, and think about it, you know, we forget now, they try to push it away, we forget Reverend Wright, we forget Bill Ayers.
[00:41:09.364 --> 00:41:17.185]  The people that Obama associated with, he couldn't get a job as a Chicago police officer, let alone an FBI agent.
[00:41:17.265 --> 00:41:20.146]  My God, if I was hanging out with terrorists, I'd be in prison!
[00:41:20.446 --> 00:41:21.826]  Right, well, you and me.
[00:41:23.206 --> 00:41:26.187]  No, there's just, we know nothing about his background.
[00:41:26.547 --> 00:41:32.248]  He's 100% phony, and we need the public, everyone out there, go to my website and spread it to everyone you know.
[00:41:32.717 --> 00:41:34.198]  Obamacrimes.com.
[00:41:34.238 --> 00:41:34.999]  Phil, thank you.
[00:41:35.299 --> 00:41:37.340]  As this develops, we'll talk to you more in the future.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:37.841]  Be careful.
[00:41:38.261 --> 00:41:38.621]  Thank you.
[00:41:39.542 --> 00:41:40.603]  Alright, thank you, Phil Burke.
[00:41:41.103 --> 00:41:50.610]  Okay, um, I got a bunch of swine flu news and military police state news on the other side of this break and then some of your phone calls.
[00:41:51.211 --> 00:41:51.631]  Stay with us.
[00:41:54.073 --> 00:41:54.973]  We're on the march.
[00:41:55.474 --> 00:41:57.075]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:41:57.996 --> 00:42:00.678]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:42:03.817 --> 00:42:08.820]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.823]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:18.666]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:42:18.966 --> 00:42:23.829]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.550]  Number three,
[00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:30.392]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:42:31.232 --> 00:42:33.893]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:42:34.134 --> 00:42:38.335]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:42:38.655 --> 00:42:42.277]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:42:42.497 --> 00:42:47.999]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:42:48.219 --> 00:42:51.340]  You can get more information at www.solutionsfromscience.com.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.783]  MySolarBackup.com.

[00:43:03.817 --> 00:43:05.378]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:43:05.498 --> 00:43:10.159]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:43:10.219 --> 00:43:12.980]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:43:13.181 --> 00:43:16.062]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:43:16.222 --> 00:43:22.084]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:43:22.304 --> 00:43:25.267]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:43:25.547 --> 00:43:32.454]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:43:32.534 --> 00:43:35.677]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:43:35.817 --> 00:43:37.499]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com

[00:43:50.989 --> 00:43:52.310]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:52.851]  Take action today.
[00:43:52.871 --> 00:43:54.091]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:44:04.091 --> 00:44:11.157]  As you already know, drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:44:11.478 --> 00:44:15.881]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:44:16.162 --> 00:44:21.006]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:44:21.366 --> 00:44:28.831]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:44:29.071 --> 00:44:33.354]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[00:44:33.654 --> 00:44:39.598]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:44:39.858 --> 00:44:45.622]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[00:44:45.822 --> 00:44:51.126]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.

[00:45:12.247 --> 00:45:15.810]  Everybody knows that the dice are loaded.
[00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:20.593]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[00:45:21.414 --> 00:45:25.317]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:45:26.018 --> 00:45:29.801]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[00:45:30.641 --> 00:45:34.784]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed.
[00:45:34.844 --> 00:45:38.948]  The poor stay poor, the rich get rich.
[00:45:39.228 --> 00:45:41.269]  That's how it goes.
[00:45:45.053 --> 00:45:47.814]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:45:52.055 --> 00:45:54.895]  I'm here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:45:54.915 --> 00:45:55.876]  to 3 p.m.
[00:45:56.196 --> 00:45:58.116]  Central Standard Time.
[00:45:58.136 --> 00:46:06.378]  The days and weeks and months and years all run together as we get deeper down the rathole of the New World Order.
[00:46:10.961 --> 00:46:12.402]  Wednesday's a big show coming up.
[00:46:12.422 --> 00:46:21.689]  We got Steve Quayle for two hours with a lot of new intel on the Marshall Law Police State and they're using the flu hysteria as the cover for that.
[00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:26.493]  Got several medical doctors coming up this week to basically expose the same thing.
[00:46:27.434 --> 00:46:29.555]  Dealing with these engineered bio-weapons.
[00:46:33.118 --> 00:46:33.758]  And we also
[00:46:36.391 --> 00:46:42.275]  I have other guests coming on dealing with this birther issue that just gets bigger and bigger, the socialized healthcare, all of it.
[00:46:42.775 --> 00:46:44.517]  It is coming up today.
[00:46:44.537 --> 00:46:50.121]  I also want to talk to Joe, Marcus, Jay, and a few others that are patiently holding.
[00:46:50.501 --> 00:46:51.842]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:51.862 --> 00:46:51.942]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:51.962 --> 00:46:53.303]  And we will get you up and on the air today.
[00:47:09.966 --> 00:47:11.887]  Man, there's a lot of news here I want to get to.
[00:47:12.748 --> 00:47:25.237]  And none of it has to do with Michael Jackson was killed by a shot of powerful painkiller, Demerol, given by an aide as his personal medical doctor, Conrad Murphy, slept.
[00:47:25.257 --> 00:47:29.660]  I mean, this doesn't matter.
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.361]  Why is everybody talking about this?
[00:47:32.898 --> 00:47:34.499]  What matters is this.
[00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:37.740]  And people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv can see it.
[00:47:38.201 --> 00:47:42.563]  This is from ArmyNationalGuard.com internment specialists.
[00:47:42.583 --> 00:47:43.863]  I'm going to get to this in a moment.
[00:47:44.824 --> 00:47:54.589]  But first off, you have this giant architecture of police state and FEMA camps and surveillance all being built
[00:47:55.595 --> 00:48:19.068]  over the years and the training of the police and the conditioning of the population and staging riots and provocateurs in Seattle in 99 and the army running the operation and the provocateurs and then putting thousands of peaceful demonstrators under FEMA control in a Sandpoint Naval Brig internment center and calling it a FEMA internment of political dissidents on the news.
[00:48:19.808 --> 00:48:21.649]  That's in my film Police Day 2, The Takeover.
[00:48:23.197 --> 00:48:33.196]  And thousands of drills, live action, taking over counties and city halls, taking over city governments, and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act setting up
[00:48:35.233 --> 00:48:47.842]  Federal funding for martial law in the states, and saying NORTHCOM's main job is to suppress state legislatures and governors who try to stand up to the Fed and the New World Order.
[00:48:48.403 --> 00:48:59.651]  And now, not just drills, but live-action military police in Tennessee and California, Army, Marine Corps, searching citizens' cars, running checkpoints.
[00:49:00.831 --> 00:49:02.031]  Governors say no.
[00:49:02.151 --> 00:49:03.812]  The feds say we're going to do it anyways.
[00:49:04.612 --> 00:49:08.052]  Under Obama, this is all not just continuing, it's expanding.
[00:49:08.773 --> 00:49:11.353]  So it doesn't matter who's in office, these presidents are just puppets.
[00:49:11.893 --> 00:49:18.895]  You have a foreign offshore corporate takeover happening of every sovereign nation on earth right now.
[00:49:19.235 --> 00:49:22.115]  A global depression engineered to bring this crisis in.
[00:49:22.415 --> 00:49:26.216]  A global carbon tax to fund the new world government.
[00:49:27.267 --> 00:49:30.989]  The new world government openly a bank of the world to govern us.
[00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:35.752]  I mean a direct world government owned by private interests we pay taxes to.
[00:49:35.932 --> 00:49:37.172]  It is happening.
[00:49:37.232 --> 00:49:38.473]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:49:39.113 --> 00:49:39.834]  Out in the open.
[00:49:40.094 --> 00:49:41.795]  Being announced is a good thing on the news.
[00:49:42.395 --> 00:49:48.098]  Simultaneously Department of Homeland Security reports saying you're a terrorist if you believe the Federal Reserve is bad.
[00:49:48.358 --> 00:49:49.579]  If you believe it's taking over.
[00:49:49.599 --> 00:49:50.840]  If you believe in a new world order.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.000]  If you like Ron Paul.
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:53.521]  If you like Alex Jones.
[00:49:53.541 --> 00:49:54.602]  If you like our videos.
[00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:57.831]  We've got scores of these reports we've broken.
[00:49:58.472 --> 00:50:02.435]  You, the audience, is broken by getting it out and forcing it into mainstream media.
[00:50:04.898 --> 00:50:07.160]  Then we have the civilian inmate labor camp program.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:20.092]  In fact, just to my guys running the live TV show and radio show right now, here is video of the internment specialist over here getting their training and putting Americans
[00:50:21.644 --> 00:50:28.669]  In FEMA camps and enrolling and learning how to take people and put them into the camps and how to get their riot gear.
[00:50:28.689 --> 00:50:33.293]  I mean this is just so disgusting ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:36.075 --> 00:50:37.995]  And they're actually recruiting illegal aliens.
[00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:46.117]  They have ads on there, too, that even if you don't speak English, you can come run the American prisons, and you can dress up in riot gear and SWAT team American citizens.
[00:50:46.678 --> 00:50:49.538]  And then whenever you hear about it on the news, they say, oh, it's for foreigners.
[00:50:49.898 --> 00:50:55.480]  But then when you read, Obama has said, oh, we're not going to have foreign camps, we're going to have camps in America.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:01.346]  that hold US citizens and foreigners and you're not going to have rights.
[00:51:01.686 --> 00:51:09.275]  They're already beta testing at two supermacs, one in Wyoming, one in Montana, with political dissidents in them.
[00:51:11.537 --> 00:51:13.360]  And so the Houston Chronicle and the
[00:51:14.454 --> 00:51:20.857]  New York Times all report in the last five years building these FEMA camps and taking old bases and turning them into camps.
[00:51:20.917 --> 00:51:27.721]  And we would see going back more than 10 years ago taking old camps, refurbishing World War II camps, getting the power and water turned on.
[00:51:28.081 --> 00:51:36.326]  We'd have workers there come on and say, yeah, we're all compartmentalized, but, you know, they're taking the old 747 hangars out here at the base and turning them into camps.
[00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:44.256]  We see the police arresting thousands of people in New York in 2004 who were peaceful, putting them in a FEMA brig.
[00:51:44.796 --> 00:51:45.637]  Pier 57.
[00:51:46.017 --> 00:51:48.340]  We see Austin has one out at the old airport.
[00:51:49.383 --> 00:51:53.287]  They're taking over the old mall and building one in some of the stores.
[00:51:54.067 --> 00:51:56.650]  I mean, all of this is really happening and going on.
[00:51:56.970 --> 00:52:07.720]  And they're converting large numbers of the regular army and regular National Guard force to counterinsurgent, to military police, and then having them go out and run checkpoints in America.
[00:52:08.321 --> 00:52:09.762]  So this is not for overseas.
[00:52:09.802 --> 00:52:11.184]  Yes, it has that dual use.
[00:52:13.137 --> 00:52:21.180]  Then you have the 3-1-E Infantry Resettlement Specialist, how to train to put Americans in FEMA camps for resettlement and re-education.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:25.622]  You cannot make something of this magnitude up.
[00:52:27.623 --> 00:52:28.463]  And you can
[00:52:30.396 --> 00:52:38.944]  Go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to the story titled, Army National Guard Advertises for Internment Specialists.
[00:52:38.964 --> 00:52:41.187]  In fact, guys, pull this article up.
[00:52:41.247 --> 00:52:47.232]  I want to show people watching on the internet out there and those listening how you click and the first link is to the Army.
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:54.622]  And then you click the nexus to the Army and their civilian inmate labor camp program for the United States and U.S.
[00:52:54.662 --> 00:52:55.102]  citizens.
[00:52:55.382 --> 00:52:56.442]  That's this link right here.
[00:52:56.462 --> 00:52:58.743]  I mean, this is all at army.mil.
[00:52:59.183 --> 00:53:00.263]  This is not our opinion.
[00:53:01.343 --> 00:53:03.944]  And then you click on the others, and it's all CNN.
[00:53:05.084 --> 00:53:07.525]  And it's all other mainstream news sources.
[00:53:08.065 --> 00:53:11.265]  We bibliograph, document everything we're saying.
[00:53:11.646 --> 00:53:13.066]  And that Judas Goat
[00:53:13.991 --> 00:53:16.992]  You know, Glenn Beck can say none of this exists.
[00:53:17.112 --> 00:53:18.353]  I don't want to be Glenn Beck's enemy.
[00:53:20.074 --> 00:53:22.735]  But, we sent him all this material.
[00:53:27.457 --> 00:53:30.938]  And, you know, you've asked where your sports stadiums are.
[00:53:32.059 --> 00:53:33.760]  We have the training videos.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.040]  We have everything here.
[00:53:38.402 --> 00:53:39.342]  It's so unspeakable.
[00:53:42.879 --> 00:53:54.208]  And we have the infrastructure protection training videos they give InfraGard people, where they teach about the mass graves and the quarantines and the lockdowns of cities.
[00:53:54.528 --> 00:54:00.452]  And they've been doing this year after year, and right as all the infrastructure comes together, the cherry on top is actually doing it.
[00:54:00.893 --> 00:54:03.134]  Now the question is, are they going to go ahead and implement this?
[00:54:03.314 --> 00:54:03.735]  I don't know.
[00:54:04.969 --> 00:54:12.355]  If they almost shut the whole country down over a couple flu deaths in the U.S., what are they going to do when tens of thousands die from the regular flu?
[00:54:12.375 --> 00:54:25.847]  They're going to do a PSYOP and get away with anything, and then have the military roll in and have some checkpoints, and lock down a few towns and cities, and lock down a bunch of airports, and then that will set the precedent.
[00:54:25.947 --> 00:54:26.167]  See?
[00:54:26.207 --> 00:54:27.388]  We locked everything down.
[00:54:28.402 --> 00:54:33.245]  And not many people died, and everybody took their shots, which no doubt will sterilize them.
[00:54:33.265 --> 00:54:35.766]  They've been caught doing it in the past, and it's in White House.
[00:54:36.726 --> 00:54:42.590]  You know, science is our textbook that he wrote, how to put it in the vaccines, and how to sterilize us, and how to put it in the water.
[00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:44.791]  I mean, how to use crises to get us to do it.
[00:54:44.811 --> 00:54:49.933]  I mean, you know, we've written articles that have the bibliograph, what page it's on, where he says it.
[00:54:50.414 --> 00:54:51.634]  It's just unspeakably evil.
[00:54:51.654 --> 00:54:52.575]  You've got to read it for yourself.
[00:54:54.153 --> 00:55:02.115]  So, how do they have an anti-terror exercise that goes real world, where they take over the society, but where everybody accepts it and it looks legitimate?
[00:55:03.115 --> 00:55:03.635]  Northcom.
[00:55:03.976 --> 00:55:16.819]  And they've now announced on CNN, Fox, and everywhere else, that, in fact, Google the Fox clip from last Friday, headline, Army to Aid During Swine Flu.
[00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:22.572]  And they say Northcom's new job is dealing with the American people and swine flu.
[00:55:22.932 --> 00:55:25.694]  Well, Northcom's entire job is spying on us.
[00:55:26.034 --> 00:55:27.175]  Spying on Ron Paul.
[00:55:27.475 --> 00:55:28.575]  Spying on Tea Parties.
[00:55:28.675 --> 00:55:29.276]  The Army!
[00:55:29.736 --> 00:55:31.577]  Our Army for fighting foreign enemies.
[00:55:31.997 --> 00:55:33.558]  We told you with the secret documents.
[00:55:33.838 --> 00:55:35.038]  Months later, confirmed.
[00:55:35.399 --> 00:55:36.359]  Baltimore Sun.
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.820]  Army spying on Tea Parties.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:39.921]  In fact, show them that after.
[00:55:40.421 --> 00:55:41.862]  Army spying on Tea Parties.
[00:55:48.128 --> 00:55:50.030]  Well, you've got all the videos saved in there on your screen.
[00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:50.811]  It was last Friday.
[00:55:50.831 --> 00:55:54.573]  It was something like, Army to be involved, Army to help with flu outbreak.
[00:55:57.015 --> 00:55:59.517]  Point is, you've all seen the clips out there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:59.798 --> 00:56:03.661]  The articles are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:04.721 --> 00:56:05.982]  And there it is.
[00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:10.306]  Source, FBI spied on Tea Party protesters nationwide.
[00:56:11.146 --> 00:56:15.590]  And then if you scroll down into the article, this is some mirror side a fan has,
[00:56:20.009 --> 00:56:25.293]  Yeah, that's the Northeast Intelligence Report, but it was also in the Baltimore Sun.
[00:56:25.313 --> 00:56:26.114]  I remember seeing that.
[00:56:27.174 --> 00:56:28.996]  But regardless, pull up the other article.
[00:56:29.636 --> 00:56:30.557]  Now I'm obsessed with this.
[00:56:31.177 --> 00:56:32.118]  It was last Friday.
[00:56:32.518 --> 00:56:33.399]  We played the clip here.
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:42.386]  And it was Fox News, was the headline, Army to be deployed during swine flu outbreak.
[00:56:42.426 --> 00:56:42.826]  That was it.
[00:56:44.287 --> 00:56:45.108]  Army to be deployed.
[00:56:45.128 --> 00:56:45.488]  There it is.
[00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:51.449]  I don't know if this is the clip, though.
[00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:52.950]  Probably not the clip.
[00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:53.730]  That's an older clip.
[00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:57.191]  But regardless, I always get sidetracked trying to re-document everything.
[00:56:57.211 --> 00:56:59.992]  The point is, they're saying the Army's going to be involved in this.
[00:57:00.312 --> 00:57:02.072]  Like, out of the gates, they just decided.
[00:57:02.732 --> 00:57:04.053]  All of this has been set up.
[00:57:04.513 --> 00:57:05.833]  All of this has been prepared.
[00:57:05.873 --> 00:57:08.634]  The police have been acclimated to work with the military.
[00:57:09.034 --> 00:57:12.935]  Everybody's been trained to go through this and to go along with this.
[00:57:13.715 --> 00:57:21.217]  And then they needed to be a microbe so everybody can be suspect, so everybody can be bad, so different people can be arrested.
[00:57:21.637 --> 00:57:33.900]  To train everybody now into the new biological medical tyranny that we've got to arrest people because they won't take the vaccines and they're endangering everybody else because they won't and it's the law to take all the shots we say.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.661]  To set this precedent to forcibly inject you.
[00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:42.545]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:57:42.585 --> 00:57:45.827]  Military to prepare teams in case of H1N1 outbreak.
[00:57:46.087 --> 00:57:47.948]  Back it up and let's play it for everybody right now.
[00:57:48.949 --> 00:57:51.911]  Here is the clip, ladies and gentlemen, in case you doubt us.
[00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:52.671]  Here it is.
[00:57:52.711 --> 00:57:56.813]  With the military, we're told, it's as health officials race to get vaccines ready.
[00:57:57.134 --> 00:57:57.414]  The U.S.
[00:57:57.454 --> 00:58:06.359]  government has just gotten 20 million doses and we're told it could be getting ready to start giving those shots by October, even though the trials for these drugs hasn't even begun.
[00:58:06.479 --> 00:58:07.059]  We're good to go.
[00:58:28.991 --> 00:58:30.532]  Well, I think it is dramatic, Shep.
[00:58:30.572 --> 00:58:40.996]  Fox News has confirmed that NORTHCOM has a proposal sitting on the desk of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates that would authorize the military to back up FEMA should there be an H1N1 pandemic.
[00:58:41.296 --> 00:58:52.120]  The proposal comes from NORTHCOM Commander Victor Renoir, who wants permission to set up five regional military teams who will respond if FEMA says it... Hey, let's stop right there.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.161]  They already have six.
[00:58:55.757 --> 00:59:00.820]  It's in the bill for the domestic FEMA camps and then they have the regional things already set up.
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:02.421]  It's already all set up.
[00:59:02.741 --> 00:59:07.384]  They're just telling you, oh we just now got permission, we just now deployed this.
[00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:11.867]  They have been setting this up forever and then magically the flu's popping up.
[00:59:12.898 --> 00:59:13.819]  And it's a non-event.
[00:59:13.859 --> 00:59:14.840]  It's already mutated.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.961]  Shot won't protect you.
[00:59:16.321 --> 00:59:16.901]  Doesn't matter.
[00:59:16.941 --> 00:59:17.822]  They all know that.
[00:59:17.862 --> 00:59:18.963]  It's all part of their hoax.
[00:59:19.504 --> 00:59:20.264]  They all know this.
[00:59:20.304 --> 00:59:21.265]  It's an absolute hoax.
[00:59:21.565 --> 00:59:23.467]  The question is, what is the hoax going to be?
[00:59:23.767 --> 00:59:26.489]  We know they're lying about it, but what is the endgame?
[00:59:28.651 --> 00:59:31.514]  That's the $64 million answer that we're looking for here.
[00:59:32.639 --> 00:59:37.542]  Because we better hope this is just a fear-monger to sell tens of billions in vaccines and expand federal control.
[00:59:37.823 --> 00:59:39.103]  This may be a big one.
[00:59:39.143 --> 00:59:41.045]  This may be their final move.
[00:59:41.665 --> 00:59:47.009]  Because look how they're trying to get the carbon tax, the Global Bank of the World, the gun bans, the open borders.
[00:59:48.009 --> 00:59:49.771]  Everything is happening now.
[00:59:50.451 --> 00:59:56.835]  And remember, remember during the campaign, right after he got elected, Biden said, six months in, Obama's gonna be hated.
[00:59:57.076 --> 00:59:58.937]  But we gotta do this job for the elite.
[00:59:59.417 --> 01:00:01.519]  Didn't know he was being recorded with high-level Democrats.
[01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:10.402]  They are here to kill this country, and Obama was there just to stall people with his fake hope and change long enough to get this agenda through.
[01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:13.931]  I mean, Bush carried it all the way to the one yard line.
[01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:23.016]  And they're on the same team, and Bush's shoulder was sprained, and he had a concussion, and he went over and hugged, you know, hugged... I mean, literally, this is how they operate when he was leaving.
[01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:27.978]  We have a video of Bush hugging them, saying, I'll see you soon, thank you for the great help, oh, you're just really good.
[01:00:28.218 --> 01:00:29.979]  They're all funded by the same people.
[01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:31.880]  Obama's related to Bush and Cheney.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.020]  Totally staged.
[01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:36.202]  And so, Bush got them right down to the one yard line.
[01:00:36.502 --> 01:00:40.204]  And now they hand the ball to Obama and they said, can you bring America down for the New World Order?
[01:00:40.564 --> 01:00:42.285]  And Obama said, I'm going to try my best.
[01:00:42.545 --> 01:00:44.507]  Let me just con these suckers as best I can.
[01:00:44.547 --> 01:00:48.169]  They said, pimp game, high five, boom.
[01:00:48.569 --> 01:00:49.549]  I'm serious, man.
[01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:51.971]  And man, he is one inch.
[01:00:52.011 --> 01:00:55.373]  He's been trying to move it and he got one foot.
[01:00:55.993 --> 01:00:58.154]  Got another foot, but now he's stalled.
[01:00:58.214 --> 01:01:00.015]  Everybody figures out, you know, the play.
[01:01:00.055 --> 01:01:00.915]  He's running up the middle.
[01:01:01.455 --> 01:01:04.436]  And Obama's got, you know, one more foot he needs to get.
[01:01:04.456 --> 01:01:06.237]  Just one more, and they're getting ready.
[01:01:06.257 --> 01:01:07.837]  They're going, get ready to run the bird flu.
[01:01:08.057 --> 01:01:10.538]  We're going to use this as a smoke screen for the whole operation.
[01:01:10.919 --> 01:01:11.479]  Blue 42!
[01:01:11.819 --> 01:01:12.019]  Blue 42!
[01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:12.579]  Hut!
[01:01:12.879 --> 01:01:13.119]  Hut!
[01:01:13.279 --> 01:01:13.520]  Hut!
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:13.860]  Hut!
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.380]  And the ball is in play.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.781]  Is he going to pass?
[01:01:16.841 --> 01:01:17.601]  Is he going to run?
[01:01:17.621 --> 01:01:18.781]  Is he going to hand it off?
[01:01:18.821 --> 01:01:19.802]  What's going on here?
[01:01:21.061 --> 01:01:24.444]  I mean, can you hope and change idiots wake up and realize we don't support Bush?
[01:01:24.744 --> 01:01:26.846]  We don't support Osama Bin Laden?
[01:01:26.866 --> 01:01:29.849]  We don't support Barack Obama?
[01:01:29.889 --> 01:01:32.831]  We don't support any of these New World Order people.
[01:01:32.851 --> 01:01:33.892]  Osama Bin Laden?
[01:01:34.933 --> 01:01:35.574]  George Bush?
[01:01:36.614 --> 01:01:37.255]  Barack Obama?
[01:01:37.275 --> 01:01:38.516]  They all work for the New World Order.
[01:01:38.596 --> 01:01:39.577]  It's all theater.
[01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:42.820]  The whole world is a stage, each of us a player upon it.
[01:01:44.318 --> 01:01:47.502]  And we need everybody that loves liberty and freedom to stand up to these bastards right now.
[01:01:47.582 --> 01:01:48.042]  It's clear.
[01:01:48.142 --> 01:01:50.685]  They are going to use this as the cover for their martial law.
[01:01:51.226 --> 01:01:52.527]  Mexico was about to collapse.
[01:01:52.547 --> 01:01:53.428]  That was a beta test.
[01:01:53.769 --> 01:01:55.711]  The people were about to revolt as the summer began.
[01:01:56.772 --> 01:01:57.673]  They're not revolting now.
[01:01:57.693 --> 01:01:58.714]  They're just happy to be alive.
[01:01:59.275 --> 01:02:00.917]  That was their excuse to clamp down.
[01:02:02.523 --> 01:02:05.525]  And clearly this is a massive psyop in every way.
[01:02:05.806 --> 01:02:08.748]  I'm gonna come back and jam in a few final phone calls.
[01:02:08.788 --> 01:02:12.350]  I did want to tell you about some of our sponsors before we end this segment.
[01:02:12.671 --> 01:02:14.932]  Homegain.com has brought you this hour.
[01:02:15.413 --> 01:02:18.315]  Homegain, H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.

[01:02:29.962 --> 01:02:36.566]  A home sale maximizer is my favorite to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's values before you put them on the market.
[01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:39.468]  Everything's free at HomeGain.com.

[01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:44.291]  HomeGain.com.
[01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:53.300]  Alright, we'll jam in a few final calls here on the other side, and then retransmission of the jam-packed show begins on the audio screens at InfoWars.com.
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:03:00.487]  You can download the video of your members at PrisonPlanet.TV or watch us live right now at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:03:00.507 --> 01:03:02.469]  We want to thank all the members of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:05.354]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:03:05.394 --> 01:03:10.756]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:03:10.976 --> 01:03:15.598]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:03:15.998 --> 01:03:21.020]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:26.263]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:28.725]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:33.728]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:03:33.908 --> 01:03:34.809]  And here's the best part.
[01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:37.791]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:03:37.811 --> 01:03:41.413]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:03:41.734 --> 01:03:44.576]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:03:55.922 --> 01:04:00.444]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:04:00.744 --> 01:04:03.205]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:04:04.246 --> 01:04:05.666]  It is a big idea.
[01:04:05.686 --> 01:04:07.787]  A new world order.
[01:04:08.488 --> 01:04:12.669]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:04:12.709 --> 01:04:15.531]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:04:16.211 --> 01:04:18.352]  Put their objective being world domination.
[01:04:18.999 --> 01:04:21.444]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:22.165 --> 01:04:29.520]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:32.506 --> 01:04:37.509]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:41.452]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.

[01:04:44.394 --> 01:04:45.555]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:45.575 --> 01:04:46.335]  They're not after money.
[01:04:46.355 --> 01:04:47.436]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:47.636 --> 01:04:48.377]  They're after power.
[01:04:48.617 --> 01:04:49.457]  That's their after-measure.

[01:06:25.603 --> 01:06:27.025]  One more sponsor I was going to tell you about.
[01:06:27.045 --> 01:06:28.326]  We're jamming a few final calls.
[01:06:28.366 --> 01:06:30.569]  We're going to get to the end of the show here.
[01:06:30.869 --> 01:06:32.871]  It's FrontSight.com.
[01:06:34.933 --> 01:06:38.137]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.

[01:07:24.317 --> 01:07:26.457]  It's also a phone number on the website.
[01:07:26.857 --> 01:07:28.358]  Okay, let's go to Joe in Illinois.
[01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:29.178]  Joe, thanks for holding.
[01:07:29.198 --> 01:07:29.818]  What's on your mind?
[01:07:30.618 --> 01:07:31.519]  Oh, hi Alex.
[01:07:31.579 --> 01:07:32.359]  Great show today.
[01:07:32.679 --> 01:07:34.239]  Thank you so much for everything you do.
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:39.521]  I've been reading a lot of books by Anthony C. Sutton.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:43.125]  And I know you did an interview with him, and they're great books by the way.
[01:07:43.185 --> 01:07:46.531]  They're a little dense, but they have amazing content.
[01:07:46.551 --> 01:07:52.220]  Yeah, Anthony's son's dead, but I did interview him like 12 years ago, and then I tried to interview him.
[01:07:53.277 --> 01:07:54.518]  Yeah, he's an amazing author.
[01:08:16.825 --> 01:08:24.811]  I think he said he worked for the tax-exempt foundations, and that's how he woke up and how he came to know the things that he knew.
[01:08:25.432 --> 01:08:31.356]  And I wondered if you could comment on that, and also an amazing book that a lot of people don't know about.
[01:08:31.997 --> 01:08:36.200]  It's called FDR, My Exploited Father-in-Law by Curtis Dahl.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.501]  It's D-A-L-L.
[01:08:37.541 --> 01:08:39.002]  Yes, I've had a guest on about that.
[01:08:39.062 --> 01:08:40.343]  I've read some excerpts about that.
[01:08:41.664 --> 01:08:43.066]  Yeah, that's just amazing.
[01:08:44.107 --> 01:08:49.274]  It's hard to get a hard copy, but you can get the PDF online.
[01:08:49.294 --> 01:08:50.375]  That's the great thing.
[01:08:50.495 --> 01:08:52.398]  So many books are being put online now.
[01:08:52.458 --> 01:08:53.179]  It's really exciting.
[01:08:54.281 --> 01:08:56.343]  Oh yeah, and I mean this guy knew the Rockefellers.
[01:08:56.383 --> 01:08:57.423]  He knew the Warburgs.
[01:08:57.904 --> 01:09:03.347]  I mean, and he just explains it all, how the CFR runs everything, and how they engineer the wars and the depressions.
[01:09:03.548 --> 01:09:04.588]  They brag about it!
[01:09:04.628 --> 01:09:06.189]  These bastards all write books!
[01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:07.510]  I mean, not just books against it.
[01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:12.034]  All these elitists like Rockefeller and Helmut Schmidt, they all write books bragging Rothkopf.
[01:09:12.114 --> 01:09:12.954]  I have them on.
[01:09:13.375 --> 01:09:14.856]  Got Rothkopf on the show.
[01:09:15.256 --> 01:09:17.658]  You writes books about torturing children.
[01:09:17.678 --> 01:09:20.239]  I mean, these are just, these slimers are everywhere.
[01:09:20.259 --> 01:09:21.080]  I appreciate your call.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:21.580]  Gotta jump.
[01:09:21.921 --> 01:09:23.682]  Marcos in California, go ahead.
[01:09:25.339 --> 01:09:26.279]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[01:09:26.499 --> 01:09:27.620]  It's great to be on your show.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:32.301]  I make this pretty quick, but since I only have a limited time.
[01:09:32.321 --> 01:09:33.482]  Yeah, we've got about a minute here.
[01:09:34.182 --> 01:09:40.844]  Yeah, the problem with people really is that they all forget what really life is all about.
[01:09:42.084 --> 01:09:42.704]  You understand?
[01:09:42.844 --> 01:09:47.826]  It's all not that, you know, because none of this is real.
[01:09:48.416 --> 01:09:52.898]  Really, it's all just based on... You gotta keep your foot down on the pedal!
[01:09:53.278 --> 01:09:54.839]  Son, never mind them brakes!
[01:09:55.259 --> 01:09:57.560]  Let it all hang out, cause we got a run to make!
[01:09:58.561 --> 01:09:59.301]  Yeah, exactly!
[01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:00.962]  The boys are thirsty in Atlanta!
[01:10:01.342 --> 01:10:02.883]  And there's beer in Texarkana!
[01:10:05.165 --> 01:10:07.586]  Well, people need to understand, none of this is real.
[01:10:07.706 --> 01:10:08.087]  Nothing.
[01:10:08.207 --> 01:10:09.567]  Nothing of what they do is real.
[01:10:09.627 --> 01:10:10.648]  Life isn't real.
[01:10:10.668 --> 01:10:12.849]  It's just an imagination of what we really are.
[01:10:12.869 --> 01:10:14.590]  Well, the decisions you make are real.
[01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:16.911]  The choices on good and evil are real.
[01:10:16.931 --> 01:10:17.632]  But I agree with you.
[01:10:17.672 --> 01:10:18.352]  It's all a test.
[01:10:18.772 --> 01:10:19.273]  Great call.
[01:10:19.313 --> 01:10:20.153]  I'm sorry we're out of time.
[01:10:20.593 --> 01:10:22.634]  Jay, Taylor, Tony, others.
[01:10:22.714 --> 01:10:23.455]  Call me back tomorrow.
[01:10:23.735 --> 01:10:24.435]  Love to hear from you.
[01:10:24.675 --> 01:10:25.876]  Gonna have some more shows this week.
[01:10:25.896 --> 01:10:26.717]  We're gonna take a lot of calls.
[01:10:26.737 --> 01:10:29.038]  And we're gonna get deep into this flu.
[01:10:29.478 --> 01:10:32.540]  Deep into this internment camp, martial law situation.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.321]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:10:34.341 --> 01:10:35.803]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:10:53.533 --> 01:10:57.515]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:10:57.776 --> 01:10:59.557]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:10:59.777 --> 01:11:08.062]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:11:08.302 --> 01:11:13.525]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:11:13.845 --> 01:11:15.466]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:11:15.706 --> 01:11:22.050]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:32.978]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:11:33.278 --> 01:11:33.778]  That's right.
[01:11:34.038 --> 01:11:36.340]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.341]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:11:38.421 --> 01:11:38.621]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:11:38.681 --> 01:11:39.862]  Or visit acolablue.com.
[01:11:45.606 --> 01:11:46.887]  We're good to go.
