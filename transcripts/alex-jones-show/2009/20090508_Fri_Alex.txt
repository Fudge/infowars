[00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:33.415]  All right, folks, you never know what's going to happen on the Alex Jones Show, but we have breaking news coming from Randall Terry, who founded the pro-life organization Operation Rescue and is currently heading up Stop Obama Notre Dame.
[00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:35.877]  It's concerning political figure Alan Keyes.
[00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:37.778]  Randall, give us the news.
[00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.982]  Alan Keyes and over 20 other pro-life people are sitting behind bars right now.
[00:00:43.712 --> 00:00:45.773]  Most of them will spend the weekend in jail.
[00:00:46.473 --> 00:00:53.136]  And the reason is because Notre Dame, who claims to want dialogue over the killing of the innocent, arrested them.
[00:00:53.616 --> 00:01:07.263]  What they did was they walked on campus quietly, peacefully, praying with baby strollers with dolls in them covered with stage blood as a testimony of what President Obama is doing.
[00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:11.645]  And the police corralled them all and threw them in jail.
[00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:12.405]  They're in jail right now.
[00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:32.480]  Well, I'm sure that you've seen this latest domestic extremism lexicon from the DHS, and right here on the second page, anti-abortionism, extremism, a movement of groups or individuals who are virulently anti-abortion and advocate violence, obviously you're violent, against providers of abortion-related services, their employees and their facilities.
[00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:33.281]  Oh, and also
[00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:38.705]  Some say various racist and anti-semitic beliefs to justify their criminal activity.
[00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:42.809]  So they're trying to lump you in with violent criminals who are anti-semitic.
[00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:43.750]  How do you feel about that?
[00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.013]  Well, there's nothing like having false witness born against you.
[00:01:48.494 --> 00:01:54.579]  Obviously you can see what a grave threat it is to have baby carriages carrying baby dolls, but let's go a step beyond this.
[00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.082]  This is not just the federal government saying that we're bad people.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:09.168]  This is Notre Dame, a Catholic college, who has put people in jail for defending life, and they're going to honor a man whose policies kill life.
[00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:13.731]  I mean, the irony and the perversion could not be more stark.
[00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:16.293]  So, here's our goal.
[00:02:16.373 --> 00:02:17.474]  I know our time is limited.
[00:02:18.174 --> 00:02:21.617]  Our goal is to have over 100 people arrested over the next seven days.
[00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:32.042]  And if we can have 30 or 40 or 50 people sitting in jail here the weekend where Obama is speaking, that will make international news.
[00:02:32.582 --> 00:02:34.643]  Well, tell people how they can do that.
[00:02:34.703 --> 00:02:36.423]  People say, I wish the Pope could hear my voice.
[00:02:36.443 --> 00:02:37.284]  Listen, go to jail.
[00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:38.104]  He'll hear your voice.
[00:02:39.324 --> 00:02:40.305]  Well, how can people do that?
[00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:43.266]  How can people support you in this very short segment that we have with you?
[00:02:43.526 --> 00:02:45.046]  What websites do they need to go to?
[00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:46.147]  How can they contact you?
[00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:47.047]  How can they get involved?
[00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:50.328]  StopObamaNotardame.com.
[00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:52.510]  All one long word.
[00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.231]  StopObamaNotreDame.com.
[00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:55.952]  Number one of the most important thing.
[00:02:56.852 --> 00:03:03.396]  If I had a hundred people that said, I'll give you a thousand bucks, or a hundred people that said, I'll come and go to jail, man, I would take the hundred bodies in jail in a heartbeat.
[00:03:03.896 --> 00:03:09.339]  Because we have a chance here, like with Rosa Parks, to have a flashpoint where we actually make history.
[00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.501]  So, go to StopObamaNotreDame.com.
[00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:14.022]  The directions are there.
[00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:16.464]  You'll see Alan Keyes' letter why he's doing this.
[00:03:16.484 --> 00:03:19.906]  You can see his conversation with the police yesterday before they arrested him.
[00:03:20.287 --> 00:03:22.108]  It's a very compelling YouTube video.
[00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:25.991]  So, this is not something where we're looking for people to just watch.
[00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:27.592]  We're looking for people to join us.
[00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:32.356]  And then, of course, if someone wants to give a contribution to help us buy more baby carriages.
[00:03:32.556 --> 00:03:36.739]  We spent $400 on baby carriages last night and the police confiscated all of them.
[00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.901]  We're going to do it again and again and again.
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.042]  Well, absolutely, and you know, that's what we do on this show.
[00:03:43.102 --> 00:03:46.644]  We provide people with an outlet to make change.
[00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:48.486]  You know, we are trying to provide solutions.
[00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:53.869]  So if this is an issue that is close to your heart, obviously it should be an issue whether you're an anti-abortionist or not.
[00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.391]  They're arresting people for free speech.
[00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:58.092]  This is anti-First Amendment.
[00:03:58.132 --> 00:04:03.656]  These people should not be in jail, and we need to make it clear that we're not going to stop protesting.
[00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:07.578]  And the website is StopObamaNotreDame.com.
[00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.800]  Anything else you got for me in the last 30 seconds?
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.363]  Yes, people have a chance to make history.
[00:04:13.883 --> 00:04:19.027]  And God and his angels and demons and bad people, everyone is watching to see what we do.
[00:04:19.668 --> 00:04:26.293]  And if you want your voice to be heard, it doesn't happen just in cyberspace or on email, come here on the ground.
[00:04:26.313 --> 00:04:30.596]  Whether you'll be arrested with us or not, come here on the ground and let your voice be heard.
[00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:33.599]  Randall Terry, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:35.661]  Go help Alan Keyes right now.
[00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:36.541]  Stop Obama.
[00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:38.323]  Notre Dame.com will be back after this.
[00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:43.389]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:47.291]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:04:49.412 --> 00:04:49.992]  Hello, friends.
[00:04:50.032 --> 00:04:50.993]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:04:51.113 --> 00:04:55.735]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:04:55.835 --> 00:04:58.617]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:04:58.817 --> 00:05:01.678]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:06.561]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:07.722]  If you simply prepare.
[00:05:07.922 --> 00:05:10.884]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:05:11.164 --> 00:05:18.070]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.272]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:05:21.432 --> 00:05:21.632]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:23.113]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:32.642]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:05:32.842 --> 00:05:36.585]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:37.946]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:38.547]  Take action today.
[00:05:38.587 --> 00:05:40.569]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:54.198]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:54.678 --> 00:05:57.560]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:04.586]  Big Brother.
[00:06:05.226 --> 00:06:06.327]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:07.008 --> 00:06:08.168]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:09.590]  You want answers?
[00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.331]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:11.911 --> 00:06:15.554]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:20.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.527 --> 00:06:33.009]  Alright folks, we are back live.
[00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:36.672]  It's the Alex Jones Show this May 8th, Friday 2009.
[00:06:37.132 --> 00:06:38.353]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:42.957]  We've got Chris Pinto in this segment of the America's Secret Beginning series.
[00:06:43.017 --> 00:06:44.978]  The latest, of course, is Eye of the Phoenix.
[00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:50.023]  You can get that over at InfoWars.com or if you get all three, basically we're only going to charge you for two.
[00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:50.323]  $59.95 gets you
[00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:58.449]  All three films over at the Info Wars shop and I had Pinto on my program probably about a month ago.
[00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:01.731]  I do a little radio show here, The Info Warrior, 9 to midnight.
[00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:04.313]  And it was just a great conversation.
[00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:06.774]  I really love this guy's work.
[00:07:06.834 --> 00:07:07.054]  I mean...
[00:07:07.975 --> 00:07:10.517]  I think David Bay is the other guy, but I've seen all three of these.
[00:07:10.937 --> 00:07:11.998]  They are extensive.
[00:07:12.438 --> 00:07:18.022]  You don't have to agree with every point to see that something is going on here, and they're just so well-researched and well-done.
[00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:21.664]  It's really comparable to something that the History Channel would put out.
[00:07:21.964 --> 00:07:26.187]  So it's very digestible for people that don't know about this information.
[00:07:26.507 --> 00:07:27.848]  I'd like to thank Chris for joining us.
[00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:28.809]  How are you doing today, sir?
[00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:30.610]  I'm doing great, Jason.
[00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.091]  How are you?
[00:07:31.111 --> 00:07:32.351]  I am good, man.
[00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:35.233]  You know, Eye of the Phoenix is the latest one.
[00:07:36.636 --> 00:07:47.225]  Really just excellent, goes really deeply into Nicholas Rorick, Manley P. Hall, Franklin D. Roosevelt, the people under Roosevelt, and really the secrets of the dollar bill.
[00:07:47.285 --> 00:07:56.352]  It shows you why this Illuminati symbol, this all-seeing eye symbol, is on the back of the dollar bill, how it got there, and so much more.
[00:07:56.633 --> 00:07:59.935]  Why don't you tell people how you got started on this entire series, because it's almost
[00:08:00.976 --> 00:08:04.340]  I've been studying New World Order information for close to ten years now and making documentaries about it.
[00:08:21.907 --> 00:08:45.849]  When I was doing some of the early research on the New World Order, I came across this whole doctrine about America as the New Atlantis, and this information about Sir Francis Bacon, and this plan supposedly that went back thousands of years that looks to the ancient philosophers like Plato and Pythagoras and others, and that this plan had somehow or other been handed down
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:09:15.435]  Over the centuries, at least this is what's believed by certain writers of arcane lore, and that it was picked up by Francis Bacon and Dr. John Dee in England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, and that they had this vision when America was discovered, when Columbus makes his discovery in 1492, and then this knowledge now of this new world comes to Europe,
[00:09:15.999 --> 00:09:22.082]  Men like Bacon believed that what they had really discovered was the lost continent of Atlantis.
[00:09:22.982 --> 00:09:33.546]  Not symbolically or metaphorically, they didn't believe Atlantis was, you know, beneath the ocean as some, on the Discovery Channel and so on, you know, scuba divers going, looking up under the water.
[00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:39.829]  They believed that this continent that you and I are sitting on, that this was the site of ancient Atlantis.
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:50.748]  And they believed that it was, you know, mystical, it was symbolic, that there was a reason why the gods, if you will, had revealed it to mankind.
[00:09:51.409 --> 00:10:07.021]  And that from this land, mankind would have a new beginning, and would somehow or other resurrect the ancient Atlantis, which, according to legends and so on,
[00:10:07.566 --> 00:10:15.029]  Was not just a city, or an island, but it was a commonwealth that extended to all the world.
[00:10:15.309 --> 00:10:20.331]  Ultimately, Atlantis reigned over the whole Earth at that time, or at least according to the legends.
[00:10:21.051 --> 00:10:30.835]  And so they envisioned a new Atlantis going forth that would be based on these new philosophic ideas that Bacon had.
[00:10:31.653 --> 00:10:36.617]  And that this would ultimately envelop the world and develop into a global society.
[00:10:36.957 --> 00:10:41.781]  Yeah, develop into what they call their ideal system, the New World Order.
[00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:45.303]  Again, that's a phrase and a term that they use and we report on.
[00:10:45.343 --> 00:10:49.526]  We'll be back after this with America's Secret Beginning Zone, Chris Pinto.
[00:10:49.987 --> 00:10:50.907]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:10:50.927 --> 00:10:51.988]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[00:10:52.248 --> 00:10:54.490]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:10:59.574 --> 00:11:00.115]  You worry.
[00:11:00.275 --> 00:11:02.337]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:11:02.617 --> 00:11:02.897]  Hi.
[00:11:03.177 --> 00:11:05.660]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.204]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:12.686]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:16.050]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.031]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[00:11:18.252 --> 00:11:20.754]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[00:11:21.034 --> 00:11:24.457]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[00:11:24.757 --> 00:11:28.840]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.943]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[00:11:33.264 --> 00:11:39.268]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[00:11:39.588 --> 00:11:41.750]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.632]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[00:11:44.072 --> 00:11:48.275]  So go to offthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:11:48.716 --> 00:11:49.376]  Start now.
[00:11:49.636 --> 00:11:50.537]  Knowledge is power.
[00:11:51.328 --> 00:11:52.128]  Better take action.
[00:11:52.148 --> 00:11:53.369]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:12:00.072 --> 00:12:05.374]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:12.878]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:19.581]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:21.862]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:12:22.002 --> 00:12:24.424]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:12:24.504 --> 00:12:35.471]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:12:36.092 --> 00:12:37.372]  It's not about left or right.
[00:12:37.753 --> 00:12:39.134]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:12:39.614 --> 00:12:45.838]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:12:46.528 --> 00:12:54.291]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:12:54.771 --> 00:12:55.931]  The Obama Deception.
[00:12:56.352 --> 00:12:57.632]  The people strike back.
[00:12:59.473 --> 00:13:00.333]  Ah, springtime.
[00:13:00.773 --> 00:13:05.935]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[00:13:06.271 --> 00:13:10.755]  Well, the answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:13:10.895 --> 00:13:16.640]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:25.167]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[00:13:25.487 --> 00:13:28.170]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[00:13:28.471 --> 00:13:34.678]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants, and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons.
[00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.942]  So pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.
[00:13:39.323 --> 00:13:42.727]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas,
[00:13:43.067 --> 00:13:48.851]  Roaches, crickets, and more, and safe enough to use on your pets, ridding them of fleas and other pests.

[00:13:51.852 --> 00:13:55.154]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:13:55.214 --> 00:13:56.835]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:14:18.584 --> 00:14:19.766]  Alright folks, we are back.
[00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:20.727]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:21.748 --> 00:14:23.070]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in.
[00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:31.861]  And we are joined by Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings writer and director of all three parts, Chris Pinto.
[00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:55.012]  And Chris, you know, all of these really touch on similar ideas and it progresses, but that one idea of the creation of this new global governance, this new world order, you refer to it as possibly world democracy, you get into masonry, secret societies, the architecture of DC, and in the latest one,
[00:14:55.772 --> 00:15:02.494]  Uh, the Maitreya figure, and I want to get into that Maitreya figure a little bit later and how that may coincide with the Bohemian Grove.
[00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:05.815]  I sent you a couple pictures after our discussion, uh, the last time.
[00:15:06.175 --> 00:15:15.798]  But why don't you give an overview of, you know, people like Benjamin Franklin and Queen Elizabeth who are featured in the first one of these, uh, the New Atlantis.
[00:15:17.202 --> 00:15:20.404]  Well, Queen Elizabeth, she's a very interesting character.
[00:15:20.464 --> 00:15:28.671]  I mean, she preferred the, you know, at the time, the politics of England were very much Protestant England against Catholic Europe.
[00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:36.817]  And the Pope had excommunicated Elizabeth and was trying to have her assassinated, basically.
[00:15:37.177 --> 00:15:39.999]  And so you had all of these spies, you had Jesuits, you had
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:56.048]  Very zealous Catholics who, according to the Catholic doctrine at that time, if a monarch were excommunicated by the Pope, then Catholics who were faithful had a responsibility not to obey that monarch first, and second, to try and kill them.
[00:15:56.688 --> 00:16:02.131]  And so this created, you know, a climate of potential assassination around Elizabeth.
[00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:09.635]  So what happened was the English formed a number of groups, at least one in particular, the Rosicrucians.
[00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.612]  Uh, who formed around Elizabeth to protect her from assassination.
[00:16:15.072 --> 00:16:25.617]  So they developed a, uh, an intelligence network where they were, uh, involved with ciphers and secret codes and all this other kind of stuff.
[00:16:26.057 --> 00:16:29.779]  And Bacon and John D. In fact, John D. is the original Agent 007.
[00:16:31.526 --> 00:16:39.890]  Uh, he was, uh, the inspiration for Ian Fleming's whole James Bond series, because, uh, Dee would sign his correspondence to the Queen 007.
[00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:48.193]  He's also the original, uh, magus or wizard figure, uh, that inspired
[00:16:48.893 --> 00:16:56.558]  Dr. Faustus inspired Gandalf from Lord of the Rings, inspired Albus Dumbledore from the Harry Potter books, and so on.
[00:16:57.699 --> 00:17:11.327]  Dr. John Dee is a very interesting character, but he was the Queen's astrologer, and he had a powerful influence over Queen Elizabeth, and apparently on Sir Francis Bacon.
[00:17:11.928 --> 00:17:16.691]  But Dee was the head of the Rosicrucians for a time, and then he handed off the reigns
[00:17:17.273 --> 00:17:17.833]  To Bacon.
[00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:21.574]  Bacon ends up financing the Virginia Company.
[00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:29.016]  Heavily financing the Virginia Company that then comes to Jamestown in 1607.
[00:17:29.056 --> 00:17:39.198]  And if you look at the Great Seal of Virginia today, the Seal of Virginia has a picture of a female goddess wearing a helm and a spear.
[00:17:39.978 --> 00:17:40.319]  Okay?
[00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:46.060]  And she's got her foot on the throne of like a fallen, or on the neck of a fallen tyrant.
[00:17:46.887 --> 00:17:54.934]  And the goddess, if you look at her very carefully, they give her another name, but she is almost the exact image of Pallas Athena.
[00:17:55.074 --> 00:18:03.681]  And Pallas Athena was the goddess that Francis Bacon claimed was his muse, his inspiration and so on, of wisdom and whatnot.
[00:18:04.382 --> 00:18:10.367]  So now you fast forward into American history, a hundred and some odd years later, and you've got Benjamin Franklin.
[00:18:10.927 --> 00:18:13.830]  Benjamin Franklin was in his day like a
[00:18:14.965 --> 00:18:19.106]  Uh, he was a, you know, a latter-day Francis Bacon.
[00:18:19.206 --> 00:18:23.067]  Bacon was the father of the modern scientific method.
[00:18:23.487 --> 00:18:27.568]  He developed all of these ciphers and secret codes, had books on them and so on.
[00:18:28.069 --> 00:18:33.070]  Very involved in printing and literature and writing and publishing things and so on.
[00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.732]  Uh, and Benjamin Franklin was involved in all the same things.
[00:18:36.752 --> 00:18:46.877]  A lot of people don't realize, we know, you know, Franklin from the discovery of electricity, but he had a number of scientific inventions that, you know, the, uh, the bifocals and so on.
[00:18:47.697 --> 00:18:56.421]  Uh, but he was very involved in science, very involved in writing and printing, even as Bacon was, and he even published a book on cipher secret codes.
[00:18:57.082 --> 00:18:59.723]  But he was, during the American Revolution,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:08.122]  What Bacon was during the time of Queen Elizabeth, because Bacon was a part of this whole intelligence network to protect the Queen.
[00:19:08.823 --> 00:19:20.066]  And Franklin was really the special forces intelligence guy during the American Revolution, working on behalf of America over in Europe.
[00:19:21.166 --> 00:19:29.049]  He was in France, he was in England, he was a member of secret societies in America, England, and France.
[00:19:29.727 --> 00:19:33.748]  The three countries that were all involved in the American Revolution.
[00:19:34.108 --> 00:19:38.829]  And these secret societies, by the way, are the precursors to today's intelligence networks.
[00:19:38.889 --> 00:19:41.090]  I mean, that's even mainline.
[00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:56.174]  I mean, in The Good Shepherd, the film by Robert De Niro starring Matt Damon, they openly show you that they used Yale as a recruitment tool for people in Skull & Bones, which was yet another precursor to these intelligence agencies, to bring in the CIA and the OSS.
[00:19:58.084 --> 00:19:58.704]  Absolutely.
[00:19:58.784 --> 00:20:13.988]  I mean, Her Majesty's Secret Service, you know, MI5, MI6, and all of that in England was with Walsingham, who was working with Bacon, John D., all of these guys.
[00:20:14.108 --> 00:20:16.669]  This is how they developed their secret code system.
[00:20:17.369 --> 00:20:25.491]  It's brought to America, and from America, as you said, it ultimately unfolds into our, you know, the OSS and then the CIA today.
[00:20:26.653 --> 00:20:30.876]  But it's a very interesting history, but it's all based on these secret societies.
[00:20:32.377 --> 00:20:36.761]  And so Franklin was very, very interesting.
[00:20:36.801 --> 00:20:47.950]  In fact, there are some people who have written books about Franklin calling him a spymaster and even questioning his loyalty to the United States during the Revolutionary War.
[00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:55.136]  Because it came out years after the war that Franklin had a double agent.
[00:20:55.959 --> 00:21:04.401]  Uh, a British spy that was working on his staff, and that he'd been warned about many times, but he never did anything, uh, to get rid of the guy.
[00:21:04.761 --> 00:21:09.162]  And there's actually a book out there called Ben Franklin Patriot or Spy.
[00:21:09.182 --> 00:21:18.924]  Um, and, uh, it's called Number 23 Ben Franklin Patriot or Spy because Franklin's codename with British intelligence was Number 23.
[00:21:20.869 --> 00:21:23.972]  Uh, and or number 72, sorry, number 72.
[00:21:24.312 --> 00:21:25.793]  And he was also called Moses.
[00:21:25.933 --> 00:21:27.214]  That was his other nickname.
[00:21:27.955 --> 00:21:32.979]  But Franklin was involved with a secret group in England called the Hellfire Club.
[00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:39.524]  And you mentioned this last time I was on the radio with you, Jason, about, uh, you know, Franklin and the Hellfire Club.
[00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:44.968]  And then now they found in the 1990s, they dug up his home there in London.
[00:21:45.672 --> 00:21:50.674]  And found all of these dead bodies, you know, the bones of these cadavers and so on.
[00:21:50.914 --> 00:21:52.795]  And that's mainline news, by the way.
[00:21:52.835 --> 00:21:55.796]  That's not just me and you talking about it or some obscure author.
[00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:58.296]  I think it was like London Telegraph or Guardian.
[00:21:58.336 --> 00:22:00.357]  I mean, it was as mainline as it could get.
[00:22:01.437 --> 00:22:10.020]  Yeah, in fact, today they've got, they've turned his home into a museum where you can go there and they actually have some of the bones.
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.401]  They found not only the bones of
[00:22:12.266 --> 00:22:15.947]  Adults and children, but they found animal bones beneath those.
[00:22:16.947 --> 00:22:26.390]  And I've seen a few pictures of the remains, and they look like they're sort of blackened in places and charred, almost as if they had been burned.
[00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:35.872]  And, you know, one of the things that satanic groups do, they have human sacrifices, but they also have animal sacrifices as well.
[00:22:36.652 --> 00:22:40.113]  And, you know, we can only wonder their official explanation.
[00:22:40.877 --> 00:22:47.882]  Is that there was a medical school in Franklin's home for like a year and a half or two years, and that that's where the bodies came from.
[00:22:50.083 --> 00:22:58.969]  But still, he was, you know, deeply involved with this Hellfire group that had been founded by Sir Francis Dashwood.
[00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:07.875]  And Dashwood was like a close advisor to King George III, who was the king we were fighting against in the American Revolution.
[00:23:08.841 --> 00:23:13.524]  Uh, Dashwood was a member of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, he was a prominent member.
[00:23:14.245 --> 00:23:25.793]  And there were other political figures that were a part of this, uh, group, uh, that called themselves the Monks of Medbanham Abbey, but their nickname was the Hellfire Club.
[00:23:26.634 --> 00:23:31.117]  And I believe the Hellfire Club, if you study them and what they were into,
[00:23:32.806 --> 00:23:40.938]  I believe they were a precursor to the Bohemian Grove Club that you guys exposed in Alex Jones' video, you know, showing the
[00:23:41.819 --> 00:23:42.640]  I don't know.
[00:24:02.273 --> 00:24:02.573]  I don't know.
[00:24:21.781 --> 00:24:27.105]  The Owl God, Moloch, this 40 foot statue that's hollowed out and has a little sound system in it.
[00:24:27.406 --> 00:24:32.229]  Everybody starts cheering and fireworks go off and that's the kickoff of this ceremony.
[00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.850]  Very Christian.
[00:24:34.011 --> 00:24:36.132]  Yeah, well, exactly.
[00:24:36.813 --> 00:24:43.358]  But all those elements, well at least the dressing up like, you know, Popes and Cardinals and Bishops and this kind of thing.
[00:24:43.738 --> 00:24:45.440]  The Hellfire Club did all of that.
[00:24:45.908 --> 00:24:52.473]  They also had a statue, which they have sort of a parallel of at the Bohemian Grove.
[00:24:52.533 --> 00:25:00.199]  They had a statue, as you went into their underground, of a figure with his finger over his lips.
[00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:02.360]  Like, be quiet.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.302]  Don't, you know, keep secrets.
[00:25:04.802 --> 00:25:05.883]  And they do the same thing.
[00:25:05.923 --> 00:25:06.864]  Who is that figure?
[00:25:07.084 --> 00:25:07.524]  It is St.
[00:25:07.684 --> 00:25:08.745]  John of Maplenuk.
[00:25:09.065 --> 00:25:11.407]  And yeah, they openly have him as a mascot.
[00:25:11.427 --> 00:25:13.769]  And if you see it, it's a statue of him going like this.
[00:25:14.509 --> 00:25:26.534]  And, you know, later on in the program, probably after we go over Riddles in Stone in the next segment, I want to go over this Maitreya figure that is also at the Bohemian Grove, and also very, very large.
[00:25:26.774 --> 00:25:43.662]  You know, it seems that the more information we get about the Grove, the more into the occult they are, the more they are into, you know, all these different mystery religions, all these things outside of Christianity, and, you know, they all, you know, not all of them, but, you know, the people like the Bush family, oh, we're Christian conservatives, really, what are you doing?
[00:25:44.182 --> 00:25:45.284]  At the Bohemian Grove.
[00:25:45.604 --> 00:25:49.489]  And this Matreya figure is just as massive as this Moloch figure.
[00:25:49.509 --> 00:25:51.011]  We're going to go over that on the other side.
[00:25:51.552 --> 00:25:53.114]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:53.415 --> 00:25:54.176]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[00:25:54.196 --> 00:25:55.157]  We'll be back after this.
[00:25:55.237 --> 00:25:56.859]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:26:02.085 --> 00:26:03.166]  We're good to go!
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.360]  I think so.
[00:26:45.845 --> 00:26:50.208]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:27:06.252 --> 00:27:11.596]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:27:12.137 --> 00:27:18.321]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:27:18.661 --> 00:27:20.443]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:27:20.603 --> 00:27:22.985]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:27:23.065 --> 00:27:33.953]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:27:36.241 --> 00:27:37.522]  It's not about left or right.
[00:27:37.902 --> 00:27:39.303]  It's about a one world government.
[00:27:39.763 --> 00:27:46.127]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:27:46.688 --> 00:27:54.453]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:27:54.933 --> 00:27:56.094]  The Obama Deception.
[00:27:56.514 --> 00:27:57.715]  The people strike back.
[00:27:59.309 --> 00:28:05.535]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:28:05.976 --> 00:28:13.764]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:28:14.104 --> 00:28:19.690]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.951]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:28:22.251 --> 00:28:27.013]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:28:27.353 --> 00:28:32.115]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:28:32.576 --> 00:28:36.437]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:28:36.918 --> 00:28:37.938]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:28:37.998 --> 00:28:42.100]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.881]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:28:47.402 --> 00:28:49.925]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:29:10.486 --> 00:29:10.746]  I think so.
[00:29:26.135 --> 00:29:26.735]  We're good to go.
[00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:51.752]  Factory Direct.
[00:29:51.953 --> 00:29:53.939]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:29:54.179 --> 00:29:54.962]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:30:36.471 --> 00:30:38.613]  Yeah, the people saying that are the elite.
[00:30:38.993 --> 00:30:39.654]  Better off dead.
[00:30:39.694 --> 00:30:41.995]  That's what population sustainability is about.
[00:30:42.976 --> 00:30:47.420]  And, uh, you know, I don't like it any more than anybody else does, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to report on it.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:55.106]  We're joined by Chris Pinto, who is the writer and director of the Secret Mysteries of America's Beginning series, that's The New Atlantis.
[00:30:55.706 --> 00:30:59.930]  Riddles in stone and of course the latest Eye of the Phoenix, Secrets of the Dollar Bill.
[00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:04.974]  You can get all three of them right now at the Info Warshop for the bargain price of $59.95.
[00:31:05.054 --> 00:31:06.435]  When you get two, you get one free.
[00:31:06.755 --> 00:31:09.838]  And like I said, these movies are each well over two hours.
[00:31:09.878 --> 00:31:13.821]  They cover... I mean, this interview we're not going to be able to cover one-tenth of the information.
[00:31:14.381 --> 00:31:24.385]  In these films, and what's really great about these films, Chris, and on the other side I want to get into this Maitreya figure and all that other stuff, but what's really great about these films is that you go to the Theosophic Society.
[00:31:24.665 --> 00:31:27.246]  You get information from the horse's mouth.
[00:31:27.286 --> 00:31:32.508]  You talk to high-level masons on camera and they reveal so many telling things.
[00:31:32.568 --> 00:31:40.531]  I mean, one of the most haunting images for me in the entire series is when you are explaining the Stone of Destiny and Nicholas Rorick
[00:31:41.031 --> 00:31:47.037]  And the gentleman who's at the Theosophic Society shows you the little bust of Nicholas Rorick.
[00:31:47.077 --> 00:31:49.359]  I think it's a copper bust or something like that.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.261]  And he starts rubbing the box.
[00:31:52.082 --> 00:31:59.529]  I mean, the look on his face and the way that he's rubbing this box that Nicholas Rorick is supposedly holding of the Stone of Destiny is just so...
[00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:00.710]  Eerie.
[00:32:01.131 --> 00:32:02.492]  I mean, was that kind of the goal?
[00:32:02.552 --> 00:32:05.173]  To go get the information from the horse's mouth?
[00:32:05.193 --> 00:32:06.714]  To go to the Theosophic Society?
[00:32:06.734 --> 00:32:15.200]  To go to those people that would talk, you know, positively about people like Manly P. Hall and people like, uh, who wrote Morals and Dogma?
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.361]  Why can't I think of his name?
[00:32:17.742 --> 00:32:19.323]  Who wrote Morals and Dogma?
[00:32:19.343 --> 00:32:20.604]  He's big time in the series.
[00:32:21.474 --> 00:32:21.995]  Albert Pike?
[00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:23.357]  Albert Pike, that's right.
[00:32:23.417 --> 00:32:24.057]  Boss of Pike.
[00:32:24.398 --> 00:32:33.850]  I mean, you do such a great job of, again, getting the opinions of those who are in favor of this stuff, who love Nicholas Rorick, who love to be Masons.
[00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.032]  I mean, was that the goal?
[00:32:35.072 --> 00:32:36.393]  To get it right from the source?
[00:32:37.626 --> 00:32:38.227]  Absolutely.
[00:32:38.267 --> 00:32:43.651]  That was our intent, you know, as we began with Volume 1.
[00:32:44.832 --> 00:32:52.258]  There's a lot of books, you know, a lot of literature out there talking about these issues, talking about Freemasonry and the secret societies and so on.
[00:32:52.898 --> 00:32:58.123]  And what I was really hoping we'd be able to do is to talk to as many of these people as possible.
[00:32:58.723 --> 00:33:02.106]  And we created, you know, a history channel type format.
[00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:03.207]  We're good to go.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:26.109]  And these are guys who often speak out against conspiracy theorists and people like yourself and Alex Jones and guys like me and whatnot.
[00:33:26.169 --> 00:33:30.492]  And so, you know, our approach to them was, hey, listen, we want to hear your side of the story.
[00:33:30.732 --> 00:33:33.794]  Just, you know, these are the questions I'm going to ask you.
[00:33:33.955 --> 00:33:38.458]  And you, you know, you tell me what's the what's the right understanding of these things.
[00:33:39.042 --> 00:33:42.044]  And so the interviews were very casual.
[00:33:42.084 --> 00:33:43.745]  I tried to keep them very relaxed.
[00:33:43.866 --> 00:33:48.629]  There was no, you know, hostile, trying to put them in an awkward position.
[00:33:49.069 --> 00:33:51.351]  I just asked them the questions and then let them talk.
[00:33:52.071 --> 00:34:04.180]  And I guess because they were relaxed, they were willing to come out with and reveal, I think, a lot of information that they would have been much more guarded about otherwise.
[00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:07.863]  And at least that's what we're told from others who see the series.
[00:34:08.416 --> 00:34:21.333]  But that guy, Dr. Obadiah Harris at Manly Hall's Society and Library, who's rubbing the statue of Nicholas Roerich, he's a particularly creepy guy.
[00:34:21.353 --> 00:34:26.420]  He's the guy who says that democracy has an occult promise.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:27.680]  Uh, to it.
[00:34:28.301 --> 00:34:31.622]  And you, you see, you know, you and I, we grew up in America.
[00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:34.223]  Most Americans grew up with the idea of democracy.
[00:34:34.583 --> 00:34:40.645]  And we're just thinking of it, you know, you, you, you vote on issues and it's the will of the people and that kind of thing.
[00:34:41.246 --> 00:34:43.046]  And it's just American freedom.
[00:34:43.607 --> 00:34:55.031]  To the occult societies, democracy, the idea of self-government, uh, is, it takes on a whole different meaning.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:07.167]  And it's just a very bizarre, very mystical meeting, and it's about the idea of humanity really ascending into Godhood.
[00:35:07.867 --> 00:35:14.891]  And they look forward to a central figure, whether they call him the Maitreya, the Christ,
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:41.884]  the you know the world teacher uh... a central figure like a this is why there's so much worship of barack obama because they're looking for somebody like this who will step forward onto the world stage and lead mankind into this glorious golden era uh... but this man there you know that they're anticipating they believe that he is a god and on the other side we're going to get into that matreya it's the alex jones show we'll be back after this
[00:35:49.901 --> 00:35:52.902]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:35:53.822 --> 00:35:56.623]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36:05.145 --> 00:36:06.386]  Health Lesson 101.
[00:36:06.806 --> 00:36:08.967]  Swine flu is the topic of news.
[00:36:09.647 --> 00:36:13.648]  Fear and panic seems to be at the top of our emotions.
[00:36:15.174 --> 00:36:19.876]  If your colon is cleansed of toxins, you are less susceptible to any flu virus.
[00:36:20.456 --> 00:36:24.438]  Viruses love unhealthy bodies and attack our system to make us sick.
[00:36:24.698 --> 00:36:26.719]  So get prepared before the attack.
[00:36:27.039 --> 00:36:27.980]  Drink your way to health.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.081]  Order online at GetTheTea.com.
[00:36:31.321 --> 00:36:33.062]  That's Get The Tea.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.681]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:37:03.286 --> 00:37:05.407]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:37:05.907 --> 00:37:12.911]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:37:13.492 --> 00:37:19.655]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:37:20.075 --> 00:37:21.917]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:37:22.057 --> 00:37:24.479]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:35.567]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:37:36.127 --> 00:37:37.408]  It's not about left or right.
[00:37:37.809 --> 00:37:39.170]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:45.895]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:37:46.562 --> 00:37:54.328]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:54.828 --> 00:37:55.969]  The Obama Deception.
[00:37:56.409 --> 00:37:57.590]  The people strike back!
[00:38:00.828 --> 00:38:01.708]  Spring is here.
[00:38:01.948 --> 00:38:02.729]  Growing season.
[00:38:02.909 --> 00:38:04.889]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:06.510]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:07.490]  Think about it.
[00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:11.651]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:38:11.891 --> 00:38:15.352]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:38:15.572 --> 00:38:18.153]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:38:18.413 --> 00:38:30.276]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[00:38:30.516 --> 00:38:30.956]  I think so.
[00:39:11.566 --> 00:39:16.888]  We are back.
[00:39:17.968 --> 00:39:23.250]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.250]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in.
[00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:30.832]  And before we go back to Chris Pinto, I want to thank another one of our great sponsors, Pepperspray.com.
[00:39:30.892 --> 00:39:32.292]  That's Pepperspray.com.
[00:39:32.332 --> 00:39:33.093]  The call line is 1-800-908-9988.
[00:39:33.113 --> 00:39:33.353]  That's 1-800-908-9988.
[00:39:37.854 --> 00:39:38.254]  8-8.
[00:39:38.675 --> 00:39:46.219]  And you can not only get pepper spray to defend yourself here, you can get stun guns, tasers, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.821]  And you know, we just ran that story last night.
[00:39:48.881 --> 00:39:50.882]  I don't know if we talked about it on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:39:50.942 --> 00:39:53.464]  College student shoots, kills home invader.
[00:39:54.004 --> 00:39:59.268]  These people went into the house, they separated 10 different people, women on one side, guys on the other.
[00:39:59.988 --> 00:40:02.650]  They overheard him saying, hey, do you have enough bullets?
[00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.031]  And he's like, yeah, I have enough.
[00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:05.592]  Luckily, someone was armed.
[00:40:06.112 --> 00:40:06.812]  Got his gun.
[00:40:07.232 --> 00:40:08.793]  Shot and killed one of the perpetrators.
[00:40:08.833 --> 00:40:09.873]  The other people ran away.
[00:40:09.913 --> 00:40:11.373]  They're now being detained by police.
[00:40:11.734 --> 00:40:15.074]  But arming yourself is a way to protect yourself.
[00:40:15.134 --> 00:40:30.119]  And if you live in a state like New York, like I do, you know, I'm out in Texas now, but I still have my place in New York, where it is almost an impossibility, let me repeat that, almost an impossibility to get a carry and conceal permit, please think about getting a stun gun, a taser, pepper spray.
[00:40:30.379 --> 00:40:32.619]  Pepperspray.com is the website.
[00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:32.699]  1-800-908-9999.
[00:40:36.581 --> 00:40:45.765]  Alright, that last segue talking about this Maitreya figure is really where I wanted to go into this interview because the Maitreya figure is, I mean, it looks like a Buddha.
[00:40:45.905 --> 00:40:53.369]  Some people are saying this is the new Christ, this is going to be the Antichrist, you touch upon it in Riddles in Stone at the end saying, you know,
[00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:59.512]  Some people believe it's going to be coming very shortly and then really hit it out of the ballpark in Eye of the Phoenix.
[00:40:59.732 --> 00:41:07.897]  Why don't you just give a brief synopsis of what this means and what the people who believe in this stuff think this betrayal will bring to them?
[00:41:09.289 --> 00:41:14.231]  Well, a lot of it begins, well it goes back, they would tell you that it goes back thousands of years.
[00:41:14.671 --> 00:41:18.193]  It really comes into Western culture through Madame H.P.
[00:41:18.213 --> 00:41:21.594]  Blavatsky, who was the founder of the Theosophical Society.
[00:41:22.074 --> 00:41:28.537]  And we talk about her, a lot of people don't realize how many people, prominent people, were Theosophists.
[00:41:28.937 --> 00:41:36.640]  Henry Wallace, who was the Vice President under FDR, Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:59.041]  Thomas Edison and a whole host of others were members of the whole Theosophical Movement, where Madame Blavatsky is literally promoting, through her writings, she's promoting Lucifer, the Archangel Lucifer, as the true God, and claiming that the God of the Bible, the God of Judeo-Christianity, is a false god and really a devil.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.080]  I think so.
[00:42:19.419 --> 00:42:24.623]  That's a short, brief explanation of what the Maitreya is.
[00:42:25.364 --> 00:42:33.830]  And, of course, we talk about it in Riddles in Stone, in the second part, because the architecture of Washington, D.C., that's what Riddles is about.
[00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:35.491]  The architecture of D.C.
[00:42:35.551 --> 00:42:43.597]  is all engineered to promote the occult doctrine that man is ultimately his own god, and that man ascends into godhood.
[00:42:44.324 --> 00:42:46.344]  Uh, by degrees, by his own power.
[00:42:46.885 --> 00:42:48.785]  And that's what the Maitreya represents.
[00:42:49.485 --> 00:43:06.709]  And the, uh, the, the, the sort of the guy who calls himself the John the Baptist for the Maitreya is this guy, Benjamin Krem, who came out twenty-some-odd years ago and made a declaration in Los Angeles that the Maitreya was getting ready to, the Christ is here.
[00:43:06.789 --> 00:43:12.490]  He took out full-page ads in newspapers around the world saying the Christ is now here.
[00:43:13.151 --> 00:43:13.612]  We're good.
[00:43:24.645 --> 00:43:26.307]  He speaks at the United Nations.
[00:43:26.887 --> 00:43:33.934]  He speaks to these political and pseudo-political groups around the world, and he's been doing it for decades.
[00:43:34.655 --> 00:43:44.905]  In fact, we got a brief interview with him in Los Angeles back in 2006, and he had just come from speaking to an NGO group in the United Nations.
[00:43:45.746 --> 00:43:49.129]  And he, in fact, right after Barack Obama,
[00:43:49.807 --> 00:43:51.348]  was elected president.
[00:43:51.788 --> 00:44:04.957]  Share International, which is his organization, gave a press release saying that there were going to be spectacular things happening in the following year and that the Maitreya was going to emerge at some point, or so they believe.
[00:44:06.358 --> 00:44:13.122]  But this was a central doctrine surrounding FDR's administration.
[00:44:14.122 --> 00:44:14.583]  I think so.
[00:44:33.321 --> 00:44:35.982]  Oh sure, he helped with the founding of the League of Nations.
[00:44:37.082 --> 00:44:47.005]  And he's given credit for the, you know, League was dissolved because of World War II and then he's credited with the formation of the United Nations afterwards.
[00:44:48.526 --> 00:44:55.548]  And in fact there was this whole Rorik peace pact that was signed in the White House by Henry Wallace with FDR and so on.
[00:44:56.208 --> 00:45:04.251]  He was a very influential political figure, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and so on.
[00:45:04.772 --> 00:45:13.635]  He was lauded by political leaders around the world, especially in Tibet and the Eastern countries and so on.
[00:45:13.995 --> 00:45:15.736]  There they celebrated him openly.
[00:45:16.236 --> 00:45:23.699]  And if you see his paintings, and we go to the Rourke Museum in New York and we show all of his paintings, his paintings are all promoting
[00:45:24.352 --> 00:45:31.774]  You know, globalist ideas, ideas of unifying all the world religions, unifying all the countries of the world.
[00:45:32.935 --> 00:45:47.159]  And he was specifically working through the White House now when he went abroad toward creating or helping to create the Asian Union that we're seeing, you know, come about now.
[00:45:47.179 --> 00:45:52.641]  But he was part of the whole groundworking of that movement during FDR's era.
[00:45:53.419 --> 00:45:56.460]  So, he's promoting this idea of the Maitreya.
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:09.285]  When they built his building, called the Master Building in New York, they laid the cornerstone and they put in there a piece of what he was calling the Stone of Destiny with an image of the Maitreya.
[00:46:10.185 --> 00:46:13.486]  They put an image of the Maitreya inside this cornerstone.
[00:46:14.415 --> 00:46:20.196]  And what's really bizarre about this, Jason, this wasn't just an event where they laid the cornerstone.
[00:46:20.516 --> 00:46:22.977]  They had dignitaries come from around the world.
[00:46:23.437 --> 00:46:28.778]  From Argentina, from Spain, from Romania, from all over the world.
[00:46:28.938 --> 00:46:31.039]  Albert Einstein sends a tribute.
[00:46:31.479 --> 00:46:32.839]  Henry Wallace is there.
[00:46:32.859 --> 00:46:36.320]  I mean, it's this major event in 1929, right before
[00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:40.211]  Right before the stock market crash.
[00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:44.612]  But it was a very different environment in America.
[00:46:45.272 --> 00:46:49.414]  And it was a very mystical environment surrounding the sky rock.
[00:46:50.254 --> 00:46:52.455]  And they're all coming to see this Maitreya.
[00:46:52.495 --> 00:47:01.258]  So when you sent me these images of the Maitreya and the Bohemian Grove, I thought, oh my gosh, this really ties it all together.
[00:47:01.658 --> 00:47:03.558]  But this is the central theme for
[00:47:05.563 --> 00:47:11.086]  You know, for these secret occult groups that are manipulating our world political system.
[00:47:11.766 --> 00:47:23.292]  But they're doing it because they ultimately believe that all of their efforts are going to mystically, magically compel this person, whoever he will be, to come into the world.
[00:47:23.933 --> 00:47:30.016]  You know, now if you're a Christian as I am, then you believe this figure is the Antichrist prophesied in the Bible.
[00:47:30.916 --> 00:47:34.078]  You know, the false messiah that's going to become the one world ruler.
[00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:44.980]  Uh, but there are, I mean, there are these groups and they have links that go to the most powerful offices in the world who are really trying to bring this to pass.
[00:47:45.901 --> 00:47:51.506]  Uh, and they're involved, as you described earlier, in these occult rituals, these satanic, you know,
[00:47:52.302 --> 00:48:05.329]  Sure, but just the fact that we're just now discussing that there's a Maitreya figure there when obviously these photographs have been out there and you know mainstream media totally ignores the subject and really the alternative media only
[00:48:16.715 --> 00:48:20.918]  It seems like this is a different section of the grove.
[00:48:20.958 --> 00:48:23.220]  It seems like a different ritual goes on here.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:29.045]  And it seems like, you know, again, the elite are looking at this figure as, like you said, this coming Christ figure.
[00:48:29.525 --> 00:48:33.088]  What I don't understand is where does it fit into Buddhism?
[00:48:33.128 --> 00:48:35.290]  Where does this Maitreya fit into Buddhism?
[00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:36.351]  Why are they the same?
[00:48:37.191 --> 00:48:38.793]  Why are they represented by the same figure?
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:47.346]  Well, my understanding of it is, and it gets very complicated, even if you listen to them explain it.
[00:48:47.787 --> 00:48:52.992]  And then when you ask them questions, the ones who believe all of this, they themselves get confused.
[00:48:53.552 --> 00:48:59.538]  But the Maitreya is supposed to be the fifth incarnation of the original Buddha.
[00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:11.276]  That he has supposedly five incarnations, Gitano Buddha was his name, and he claimed that he would have a fifth incarnation, and that would be his final incarnation.
[00:49:12.077 --> 00:49:21.021]  And so they have, throughout Eastern mysticism, they have believed that this would be, that
[00:49:22.529 --> 00:49:37.317]  That Jesus and, you know, Muhammad and Krishna and all of these different figures, they believe that they all were inspired by what they call the Christ principle, or the Christ spirit, or Christ consciousness.
[00:49:37.997 --> 00:49:40.118]  Okay, that they themselves were not Christ.
[00:49:40.578 --> 00:49:43.380]  They don't believe that Jesus is the Christ.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.322]  They believe that he was just somebody who was inspired by this energy.
[00:49:48.024 --> 00:49:53.035]  But that the real Christ figure is the Buddha, is Maitreya Buddha.
[00:49:53.796 --> 00:49:58.947]  And that he will ultimately, when he comes into the world, he'll be a global messiah.
[00:49:59.885 --> 00:50:00.265]  I don't know.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:28.064]  The upper echelons of power, the true elite, they are religious, and their religion is this occult religion.
[00:50:28.104 --> 00:50:32.047]  And like you said, they do believe of the coming of this Maitreya figure.
[00:50:32.347 --> 00:50:33.408]  I mean, how can we get around that?
[00:50:33.448 --> 00:50:47.277]  How can we relate to people that, hey, even if you're not religious, even if you're secular, you don't subscribe to Christianity or Buddhism, or you're not a Muslim or a Jew, you know, how do we get to those people that this is what they believe?
[00:50:48.619 --> 00:50:50.220]  Yeah, that's a tough one.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:51:03.446]  One of the arguments that I make is I try to explain to people that the whole doctrine, the idea of a separation of church and state, people hear that and they think it means removing religion from government.
[00:51:03.786 --> 00:51:05.047]  And that's not what it means.
[00:51:05.347 --> 00:51:07.448]  What it means, if you study these societies,
[00:51:07.992 --> 00:51:10.514]  It means removing the church, i.e.
[00:51:10.594 --> 00:51:11.554]  Christianity.
[00:51:12.134 --> 00:51:15.356]  Getting Christianity out of American government.
[00:51:15.737 --> 00:51:22.521]  But they want, like when you go into Washington, D.C., and you're seeing all of these god and goddess images, and so on.
[00:51:23.061 --> 00:51:25.662]  I mean, these are all religious symbols.
[00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:29.865]  Including the goddess Persephone, which is on the top of the Capitol building.
[00:51:29.885 --> 00:51:31.346]  A lot of people don't even realize that!
[00:51:32.119 --> 00:51:32.439]  Right!
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:36.821]  You go out in front of the courthouse, they have this big deal in front of courthouses, right?
[00:51:36.861 --> 00:51:39.383]  Getting rid of the Ten Commandments in front of the courthouse.
[00:51:39.883 --> 00:51:46.786]  But right next to the Ten Commandments, they have a statue of Themis, the blindfolded goddess holding the scales.
[00:51:47.427 --> 00:51:49.408]  That's the ancient goddess of justice.
[00:51:50.248 --> 00:51:52.769]  But nobody ever says anything about getting rid of her.
[00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:58.432]  The ACLU is not leading a crusade to get rid of all the religious iconography.
[00:51:58.931 --> 00:52:06.632]  They're just trying to get rid of Christianity, or Judeo-Christianity, biblical values and teachings and so on.
[00:52:07.012 --> 00:52:10.773]  But all of the pagan stuff can remain.
[00:52:10.793 --> 00:52:23.635]  You know, the all-seeing eye stays on the dollar bill, the Washington Monument's not going anywhere, nobody's ever threatened the Statue of Liberty, even though Lady Liberty is based upon the Babylonian mother goddess of the ancient world.
[00:52:24.756 --> 00:52:26.376]  All of these are religious icons.
[00:52:26.989 --> 00:52:43.334]  And what they're doing is they're supplanting, they're getting rid of, just as they got rid of the teaching of creation in our schools, and then they put in this ancient Hindu belief about reincarnation, but they call it evolution, right?
[00:52:43.434 --> 00:52:47.155]  And they call it a science, and now that's what they're teaching in our schools.
[00:52:48.216 --> 00:52:52.857]  But evolutionary teaching doesn't have any scientific basis to it, if you study it.
[00:52:53.496 --> 00:53:06.580]  It's all based in the ancient Hindu, Eastern mystical view about how, you know, man begins as a tadpole or something, comes back as a frog, comes back as a goat, a dog, etc.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.081]  and so on.
[00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:11.342]  And it's continually evolving upward toward godhood.
[00:53:11.942 --> 00:53:14.363]  That's where all of this stuff goes.
[00:53:15.243 --> 00:53:17.564]  And it is really what they believe.
[00:53:18.665 --> 00:53:22.826]  And they believe this is the true religion of the universe, as it were.
[00:53:23.732 --> 00:53:32.422]  And that anything that you're taught in the Bible is a counterfeit, or that it's been misunderstood by Christianity, as it were.
[00:53:32.742 --> 00:53:35.165]  So, that's the real enemy for them.
[00:53:36.526 --> 00:53:37.488]  And... Go ahead.
[00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:43.975]  No, I was gonna say, you know, one of the things just to support something that you guys talk a lot about, the idea of
[00:53:44.625 --> 00:53:48.867]  You know, Alex Jones says it's not about left or right, and I couldn't agree more.
[00:53:49.727 --> 00:54:00.193]  One of the things that I often tell people, say about George Bush, who presents himself as a Christian, and then he goes off and he's bowing down to this owl god out there in the Bohemian Grove.
[00:54:01.273 --> 00:54:11.418]  If the left-wing media really hated Bush, if they hated Bush and they wanted to stop him from becoming president, all they would have had to do is just run a week-long story
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.965]  On the Bohemian Grove, the Bush family's a part of it.
[00:54:15.325 --> 00:54:24.819]  They're bowing down to Buddhas and this 40-foot owl god of Molech, and there's no way evangelical Christians would have ever voted for George Bush.
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:26.962]  They would have never voted for him.
[00:54:27.968 --> 00:54:29.049]  I don't think so.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:55:00.875]  I feel bad for my fellow Christians in America, because I feel like they're often the ones who are being lied to and manipulated, because Christianity is, you know, 80% of the people in our country profess some form of Christianity.
[00:55:01.579 --> 00:55:07.022]  And so they often use Christianity and churches and so on to manipulate this agenda.
[00:55:07.542 --> 00:55:20.510]  And a lot of what we're trying to do through the Secret Mysteries series, which is why we talk about how, yes, Christians did come here in the beginning, you know, with the Puritan Pilgrim Movement, but there were with them these secret groups.
[00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:22.911]  And as Manley Hall says, they
[00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:35.538]  Reclose their pagan ideas in this garment of Christian phraseology, but the reason was so that they could manipulate the Christian population to carry out their secret agenda.
[00:55:36.398 --> 00:55:38.179]  That's what they've been doing for 200 years now.
[00:55:39.693 --> 00:55:40.533]  What's next for you?
[00:55:40.813 --> 00:55:42.894]  Are you going to do a part four?
[00:55:43.174 --> 00:55:44.975]  Are you going to do another film project?
[00:55:55.658 --> 00:55:59.179]  They don't understand that there is no difference between the left and right.
[00:55:59.219 --> 00:56:02.420]  They don't understand that their leaders are really into the occult.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:10.422]  You know, they don't have this broad overview of what you present, so I think it's a great eye-opener if I can actually get them to throw it into the DVD player.
[00:56:10.762 --> 00:56:12.823]  What's next for Chris Pinto and David Bay?
[00:56:14.263 --> 00:56:24.186]  Well, for myself and David, we're doing our pre-production stuff for Secret Mysteries Part 4, which is the working title is War of the World.
[00:56:25.004 --> 00:56:36.270]  And it takes this whole America series and how America is really being used by these secret groups to carry out the New World Order.
[00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:37.811]  Excellent, excellent.
[00:56:37.831 --> 00:56:38.371]  We'll come back.
[00:56:38.391 --> 00:56:40.072]  We're going to talk about that more on the other side.
[00:56:40.112 --> 00:56:41.152]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:41.453 --> 00:56:42.273]  I'm Jason Bermas.

[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:00.841]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:58:01.021 --> 00:58:06.006]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[00:58:06.386 --> 00:58:08.468]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[00:58:08.808 --> 00:58:17.736]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout
[00:58:17.976 --> 00:58:18.496]  I think so.
[00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:43.012]  We're good.
[00:58:59.494 --> 00:59:02.435]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:59:02.576 --> 00:59:07.838]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:59:08.098 --> 00:59:13.481]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:59:13.821 --> 00:59:14.941]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.302 --> 00:59:24.206]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:59:24.606 --> 00:59:26.248]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[00:59:53.173 --> 00:59:54.113]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:00:16.633 --> 01:00:21.956]  Folks, here I am wearing my Bohemian Grove Trapski hat that somebody sent us.
[01:00:22.096 --> 01:00:25.258]  And next to me is the annal from 1987 to 1996.
[01:00:26.438 --> 01:00:35.203]  And if we zoom in on that, we had a caller yesterday, Chris, that was questioning, how could Alex Jones possibly get into the Bohemian Grove?
[01:00:35.263 --> 01:00:39.945]  And he was insinuating that Alex was a member, and it was all a conspiracy, and blah, blah, blah.
[01:00:40.265 --> 01:00:44.868]  The truth is, in the early 80s, they did do some mainline reporting on the Bohemian Grove.
[01:00:45.328 --> 01:00:46.390]  And we have those clips.
[01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:52.079]  They're going to be in my next film, Invisible Empire, which really goes over this globalist New World Order agenda.
[01:00:52.139 --> 01:00:55.524]  Tom Brokaw talking about it, ABC News talking about it.
[01:00:55.765 --> 01:01:00.191]  But in the annal, I want to just show this on theprisonplanet.tv really.
[01:01:00.652 --> 01:01:03.334]  Quick, and we'll zoom out from it to see what other characters are here.
[01:01:03.654 --> 01:01:06.897]  But you have a news reporter sitting here, and he's also a cartoonist.
[01:01:07.377 --> 01:01:12.441]  And he's drawing a picture, and if you missed this, if you're listening, go check it out on YouTube later.
[01:01:13.122 --> 01:01:19.466]  He's drawing, he's pretending he's doing the news, but there's the thought bubble behind him, and he's in a robe, and he has a candle.
[01:01:19.526 --> 01:01:21.208]  He's a member of the Bohemian Grove.
[01:01:21.488 --> 01:01:23.610]  And he's basically talking to everybody.
[01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:26.452]  Zoom out a little further, and let's see who our good friends are above him.
[01:01:27.312 --> 01:01:34.734]  Oh, look, it's Newt Gingrich and George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, the very good Christian men.
[01:01:35.735 --> 01:01:36.795]  Unbelievable.
[01:01:37.175 --> 01:01:47.458]  You know, what do you say to those kind of critics that, you know, they think that everything's a conspiracy, they think because Alex was able to get into the Bohemian Grove he must be a member or a Vatican assassin?
[01:01:47.798 --> 01:01:54.740]  I mean, to me it's just ludicrous, but to the outsider looking in, how do you explain to him, how do you explain to them that's not what happened?
[01:01:56.314 --> 01:02:00.436]  Well, I would, you know, we've dealt with some of those people as well.
[01:02:00.476 --> 01:02:11.583]  We had a woman call and accuse us of being controlled by radical Muslims and left a message on our machine because in our documentaries we hadn't mentioned Islam or something.
[01:02:11.983 --> 01:02:14.064]  I mean, some people do.
[01:02:14.204 --> 01:02:23.870]  I think Alex Jones and you guys, you do a great job because you're very careful to document the things that you're talking about and we try to do the same thing in our films.
[01:02:24.806 --> 01:02:29.968]  And what ends up happening is you put aside a lot of your conspiracy theories.
[01:02:30.048 --> 01:02:35.289]  If you have a conspiracy theory about something and you go and investigate it, sometimes you're wrong.
[01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:40.491]  You know, sometimes you had an idea about something and it just wasn't the right idea.
[01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:46.072]  But I think that's why it's so careful to document your evidence.
[01:02:46.132 --> 01:02:48.193]  But those kind of accusations against
[01:02:49.107 --> 01:02:52.250]  Alex, I've seen them against my partner, David Bay.
[01:02:52.691 --> 01:03:03.984]  He's been openly accused of being a member of the Illuminati because we mentioned Sir Francis Bacon and there was this whole conspiracy theory that went on about that.
[01:03:04.828 --> 01:03:14.297]  I think it just kind of comes with the territory, and so we encourage people to be careful, to prove all things, as the Bible says.
[01:03:14.337 --> 01:03:17.259]  You know, we're Christians and we admonish people.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.842]  The Bible also says, accuse no man falsely.
[01:03:20.402 --> 01:03:33.371]  So we try to refrain from that and just encourage people to seek the truth and we try to present as much documentation as possible to convict people so they would go and conduct their own investigation.
[01:03:33.971 --> 01:03:40.116]  Exactly, the proof is in the pudding and we put this stuff out there, we source it and we hope that people check out our source material.
[01:03:40.156 --> 01:03:40.976]  That's what this is about.
[01:03:41.176 --> 01:03:44.519]  When you talk about the pentagram in Riddles in Stone that's
[01:03:45.339 --> 01:03:46.459]  Inlaid in the D.C.
[01:03:46.519 --> 01:03:52.861]  architecture, of course, with the open segment, you explain this is a Faustian process and out of one of his plays, correct?
[01:03:53.921 --> 01:04:13.245]  Absolutely, and we show that it's mentioned by a very high-ranking mason, Goethe, the famous German writer in Faust, and he's publishing this broken pentagram in Faust during the same time period that Pierre L'Enfant is doing the street design for Washington D.C.
[01:04:14.085 --> 01:04:15.805]  Chris, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:04:16.205 --> 01:04:24.167]  The series is Secret Mysteries of America's Beginning, The New Atlantis, Riddles in Stone, Eye of the Phoenix, and look out for Part 4, hopefully in the coming months.
[01:04:24.187 --> 01:04:28.027]  They're in pre-production now, but I'm sure it's going to be another bang-up video.
[01:04:28.207 --> 01:04:29.208]  We'll be back after this.
[01:04:29.248 --> 01:04:30.768]  We've got Alan Watt for the full hour.
[01:04:30.788 --> 01:04:33.008]  We're going to be taking your calls in the second half hour.
[01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:33.988]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:34.068 --> 01:04:37.109]  I'm Jason Bermas, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:42.790]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:46.543]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:04:49.325 --> 01:04:50.906]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:51.026 --> 01:04:55.630]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:58.512]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:04:58.732 --> 01:05:01.594]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:05:01.774 --> 01:05:07.659]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:05:07.859 --> 01:05:10.741]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:05:11.081 --> 01:05:17.964]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:05:18.064 --> 01:05:21.206]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:05:21.346 --> 01:05:21.546]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:21.606 --> 01:05:23.227]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:05:26.488 --> 01:05:32.552]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:05:32.753 --> 01:05:36.495]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:36.515 --> 01:05:37.776]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:05:37.796 --> 01:05:38.457]  Take action today.
[01:05:38.497 --> 01:05:40.318]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:05:52.034 --> 01:05:53.961]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:05:54.443 --> 01:05:57.212]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:13.811]  All right, folks, we are back.
[01:06:13.851 --> 01:06:15.911]  It's the final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:17.132]  I'm Jason Bermes, sitting in.
[01:06:17.152 --> 01:06:19.873]  We're going to have Alan Watt come up after the break.
[01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:21.393]  We're going to take your phone calls.
[01:06:21.413 --> 01:06:26.835]  I know a lot of people have been patiently waiting at the 30 aftermark for Alan and myself.
[01:06:27.315 --> 01:06:31.517]  But I want to take this opportunity to thank another one of our great sponsors, Acola Blue.
[01:06:32.017 --> 01:06:33.138]  It's acolablue.com.
[01:06:33.278 --> 01:06:35.218]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[01:06:35.238 --> 01:06:39.520]  And Acola Blue is just this awesome machine that literally takes
[01:06:40.771 --> 01:06:48.236]  The air and creates water, and it has a reverse osmosis process, all sorts of filters.
[01:06:48.256 --> 01:06:49.176]  1-800-691-6043.
[01:06:49.196 --> 01:06:50.657]  It's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:06:51.098 --> 01:06:53.899]  It is delicious.
[01:06:53.979 --> 01:06:55.180]  It's the water I drink here.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:56.081]  It keeps it cool.
[01:06:56.121 --> 01:06:56.841]  You can get it hot.
[01:06:56.941 --> 01:06:58.742]  I mean, it's the coolest machine ever.
[01:06:59.023 --> 01:07:00.463]  acolablue.com.
[01:07:00.824 --> 01:07:01.824]  Know what you're drinking.
[01:07:01.844 --> 01:07:02.365]  1-800-691-6043.
[01:07:02.725 --> 01:07:07.608]  All right, we got a few minutes before the break.
[01:07:07.688 --> 01:07:08.889]  I want to play this clip.
[01:07:09.429 --> 01:07:16.771]  Of this young girl being arrested for calling 9-1-1 because her father's having a seizure.
[01:07:16.851 --> 01:07:17.591]  How dare she?
[01:07:17.931 --> 01:07:18.591]  Hit it, Jaren.
[01:07:21.672 --> 01:07:22.672]  And we're hitting it.
[01:07:22.692 --> 01:07:27.253]  In Lincoln Park every year, people dial 9-1-1 more than 14,000 times.
[01:07:27.653 --> 01:07:32.575]  And let's make it clear right up front, those emergency calls are generally very well handled.
[01:07:32.935 --> 01:07:36.716]  But that doesn't make what happened to Adrienne Ledesma any less shocking.
[01:07:36.736 --> 01:07:38.156]  I was really scared.
[01:07:39.554 --> 01:07:42.356]  Because, you know, it's my dad, and he fell.
[01:07:42.917 --> 01:07:44.137]  He was not supposed to fall like that.
[01:07:44.318 --> 01:07:53.985]  His fall was so frightening because he was just three weeks out of the hospital where he underwent brain surgery, and suddenly, he's on the kitchen floor, unconscious and shaking with a severe seizure.
[01:07:54.365 --> 01:07:55.146]  I was scared.
[01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:57.888]  Like, I don't know, I was freaking out.
[01:07:58.467 --> 01:08:01.489]  So this 17-year-old grabbed her phone and dialed 911.
[01:08:01.869 --> 01:08:04.992]  She says she got no quick answers, so hung up and called again.
[01:08:05.012 --> 01:08:11.176]  Now you know those emergency calls are recorded, but did you know the recording starts even before the call is answered?
[01:08:14.598 --> 01:08:22.304]  So you can hear her near panic when again she can't get an immediate answer, blurting out the F-word just as the call is picked up.
[01:08:22.324 --> 01:08:22.304]  911.
[01:08:22.524 --> 01:08:25.086]  I need an ambulance and a heart rate monitor.
[01:08:26.772 --> 01:08:31.755]  But the Lincoln Park cop who takes the call admonishes her, and only makes her more frantic.
[01:08:32.035 --> 01:08:35.157]  Well, okay, first of all, you don't need to swear over 9-1-1.
[01:08:35.297 --> 01:08:36.037]  Okay.
[01:08:36.137 --> 01:08:36.878]  And slow down.
[01:08:36.898 --> 01:08:37.758]  F***ing ambulance!
[01:08:38.799 --> 01:08:41.581]  You haven't had a chance to tell him how serious this is, right?
[01:08:42.381 --> 01:08:43.742]  And he's already hung up the phone.
[01:08:44.782 --> 01:08:46.263]  Well, I thought my dad was gonna die.
[01:08:46.363 --> 01:08:47.144]  I was really scared.
[01:08:47.444 --> 01:08:48.164]  So you called back.
[01:08:48.184 --> 01:08:48.905]  9-1-1.
[01:08:49.905 --> 01:08:51.386]  Um, are you gonna give me an ambulance?
[01:08:51.466 --> 01:08:52.767]  Are you gonna swear again, you stupid b***h?
[01:08:52.787 --> 01:08:54.368]  Are we gonna have a f***ing talk?
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.281]  Your dad's still on the floor.
[01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:04.086]  Well, I'm thinking he's seriously hurt because he's still having a seizure and it's a really long seizure.
[01:09:04.106 --> 01:09:08.771]  And I'm thinking that I want to, you know, complain about this guy because he shouldn't be hanging up on me.
[01:09:09.172 --> 01:09:10.934]  So she calls back a third time.
[01:09:10.954 --> 01:09:11.595]  9-1-1.
[01:09:11.675 --> 01:09:14.718]  I just want to know what's your name because you're getting sued.
[01:09:15.078 --> 01:09:15.299]  Good.
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:16.460]  What is it?
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:16.680]  Good.
[01:09:17.261 --> 01:09:17.801]  Good for you.
[01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:18.983]  Because you're a buffoon.
[01:09:20.808 --> 01:09:25.410]  After wasting more than six minutes, the cop finally called the rescue squad.
[01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:30.331]  I kept getting a 9-1-1 call from this filthy-mouthed girl that wanted a rescue.
[01:09:30.431 --> 01:09:33.992]  I never found out what it was and I was never able to transfer it over to you.
[01:09:34.272 --> 01:09:39.294]  And that's the same story he told on the police radio when he dispatched a squad car to the house.
[01:09:39.814 --> 01:09:44.276]  I kept getting 9-1-1 calls from this girl, hostile girl, requesting a rescue.
[01:09:44.936 --> 01:09:46.316]  No idea what it's for.
[01:09:47.176 --> 01:09:48.137]  I couldn't get through her
[01:09:49.369 --> 01:09:51.090]  Alright, let's stop it because we're about to go to break.
[01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:10.943]  1-1-1 for an ambulance.
[01:10:11.284 --> 01:10:12.724]  Give me a break.
[01:10:12.945 --> 01:10:17.307]  And this just shows how out of control the police officers are, how they're on power trips.
[01:10:17.548 --> 01:10:22.991]  You know, we would have showed another clip, and maybe we'll do so at the end of the show, where people go to protest Scientology.
[01:10:23.171 --> 01:10:25.353]  They don't get within 400 feet of the front door.
[01:10:25.393 --> 01:10:26.213]  They're on the sidewalk.
[01:10:26.373 --> 01:10:30.476]  They immediately throw one of them down, arrest them, and threaten the others with arrest.
[01:10:30.616 --> 01:10:35.640]  It's the new America, and we're going to be discussing that with Alan Watt of CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.843]  After this, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:10:37.904 --> 01:10:38.906]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[01:10:38.946 --> 01:10:40.910]  My little blog is TheInfoWarrior.com.
[01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:45.760]  But go check out all the news at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com right now.
[01:10:59.611 --> 01:11:02.773]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:04.874]  Now, going green can save money.
[01:11:05.055 --> 01:11:10.398]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[01:11:10.598 --> 01:11:18.343]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[01:11:18.643 --> 01:11:29.050]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:29.710]  I think so.
[01:11:59.991 --> 01:12:05.297]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:12:05.797 --> 01:12:12.805]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:12:13.386 --> 01:12:19.553]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:12:19.973 --> 01:12:21.795]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:12:21.935 --> 01:12:24.357]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:12:24.437 --> 01:12:35.445]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:12:36.005 --> 01:12:37.306]  It's not about left or right.
[01:12:37.707 --> 01:12:39.068]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:12:39.548 --> 01:12:45.773]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:54.213]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:54.714 --> 01:12:55.876]  The Obama Deception.
[01:12:56.297 --> 01:12:57.499]  The people strike back!
[01:12:59.574 --> 01:13:02.935]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:13:03.095 --> 01:13:08.296]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:13:08.476 --> 01:13:13.257]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:13:13.437 --> 01:13:24.419]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:13:24.699 --> 01:13:30.265]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:13:30.445 --> 01:13:36.532]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:13:36.692 --> 01:13:37.313]  What about you?
[01:13:37.533 --> 01:13:43.580]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:46.083]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-866-BERKEY.
[01:13:46.203 --> 01:13:47.844]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:14:12.712 --> 01:14:13.973]  All right, folks, we are back.
[01:14:13.993 --> 01:14:15.815]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:14:15.835 --> 01:14:18.897]  Before we go to Alan Watt, I want to thank our final sponsor of the day.
[01:14:18.977 --> 01:14:22.540]  It's Homegain, H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:23.681]  Homegain dot com.
[01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:26.583]  They take care of all your real estate business.
[01:14:26.923 --> 01:14:27.423]  Not too bad.
[01:14:27.443 --> 01:14:27.704]  Not too bad.
[01:14:55.342 --> 01:15:03.585]  Well, I want to get your take on this latest DHS document and really just the out-of-control nature of police officers around the country.
[01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:08.007]  We just played that clip where this girl is trying to call 911 for her father.
[01:15:08.307 --> 01:15:09.948]  She uses the naughty F-word.
[01:15:10.008 --> 01:15:12.769]  God forbid she uses the F-word because she's in a panic.
[01:15:12.989 --> 01:15:16.590]  And she's actually hung up on by these police officers.
[01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:18.771]  Then she goes down four blocks.
[01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:22.152]  Well, we've had gradual indoctrination over 20-odd years, maybe 30, mainly through
[01:15:38.374 --> 01:15:49.155]  Fictional media, entertainment, beginning even with Starsky and Hutch, which was banned in Britain at one time because they eventually started pulling their guns out on everybody they saw on every episode.
[01:15:50.269 --> 01:16:04.361]  But now it's a standard fare, the cops are the bosses, they're the authoritarian figures, and the cops themselves come out of the same society of indoctrination, so they truly believe that they are authoritarian figures, and they were supposed to obey them.
[01:16:05.002 --> 01:16:10.206]  They don't get taught that they're there to serve the public anymore, and they haven't been taught that for an awful long time.
[01:16:10.787 --> 01:16:14.109]  And we've got to remember too, police are in the business of laying charges.
[01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:15.471]  That's their function.
[01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:18.213]  And if you call the cops for anything,
[01:16:19.535 --> 01:16:20.575]  I think really you're a fool.
[01:16:21.195 --> 01:16:31.817]  Because there's even videos up there with ex-cops who are now these lawyers that went into law stating quite openly that that's their function is to lay charges on people.
[01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:32.557]  They don't care who.
[01:16:33.277 --> 01:16:35.338]  And they actually call on the videos up on Google.
[01:16:35.378 --> 01:16:36.898]  They actually call on the public stupid.
[01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:39.038]  And explain why they're stupid.
[01:16:39.638 --> 01:16:43.839]  Because the public perception is still the old perception that the cops are there to help them.
[01:16:44.239 --> 01:16:45.519]  Cops are not there to help you.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.480]  They're there to get charges laid on anybody.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:50.141]  For anything.
[01:16:50.202 --> 01:16:53.168]  It doesn't matter if you call them and they come into your house just to have a chat.
[01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:56.455]  If they find anything at all they can charge you with, they'll do it.
[01:16:56.796 --> 01:16:59.622]  And we've got to understand that's really what their purpose is.
[01:17:00.655 --> 01:17:07.357]  Alright, well let's shift gears to this latest DHS document, Domestic Extremism Lexicon.
[01:17:07.417 --> 01:17:20.100]  I mean this one, this is the third document from DHS that we've talked about, obviously the fourth if you include the MIAC report, but right out of the gates they say this is for non-Islamic extremism in this country.
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:29.348]  Really, DHS was built up under the guise that we were going to fight Al-Qaeda and the Taliban and we needed this new agency, but nothing could be further from the truth.
[01:17:29.448 --> 01:17:31.570]  This is for the American public, is it not?
[01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:32.911]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:33.171 --> 01:17:33.551]  Absolutely.
[01:17:33.571 --> 01:17:41.759]  But then again, people who still believe that government is there to serve them, once again need to get their head checked because that went out a long time ago.
[01:17:42.651 --> 01:17:49.056]  The government has an agenda, and they'll lie about everything to get a law in the books, which they intend to expand as soon as it's passed.
[01:17:49.617 --> 01:17:51.778]  So, absolutely, that's the whole key.
[01:17:52.179 --> 01:17:56.602]  We're going into a complete new world order, where we will have no rights whatsoever.
[01:17:56.622 --> 01:17:58.364]  They've made that quite plain.
[01:17:59.004 --> 01:18:02.267]  And all they need is our compliance at every stage to accept it.
[01:18:02.988 --> 01:18:05.930]  And then they can bring through the next part, and the next part, and the next part.
[01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:09.613]  There are no rights and freedoms anymore, as far as governments are concerned.
[01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:13.658]  And the public and I've been trained that that is so as well.
[01:18:14.306 --> 01:18:19.548]  Absolutely, and in the UK right now, they have now banned 16 people from coming into the country.
[01:18:19.588 --> 01:18:21.689]  They're only releasing 10 names.
[01:18:21.749 --> 01:18:23.310]  Who knows who the other 6 are?
[01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:26.771]  But this same woman is out there saying, you know what?
[01:18:26.791 --> 01:18:28.712]  On top of that, this ID card is great.
[01:18:28.772 --> 01:18:29.732]  We can play that clip.
[01:18:29.752 --> 01:18:32.714]  In fact, we'll play that clip coming up in the next segment.
[01:18:33.074 --> 01:18:40.357]  She's basically saying, oh, the biometric thumb scan and your face scan will be on this card, and it's a good thing because people already have to prove who they are.
[01:18:40.717 --> 01:18:45.821]  It's a big part and again it was planned a long time ago because back in the 90s and mainstream Canadian CBC government television
[01:19:06.986 --> 01:19:12.308]  Wendy Meslier had a show where she talked about the coming ID cards in the mid-90s.
[01:19:12.368 --> 01:19:13.668]  Actually, it was 1998.
[01:19:14.588 --> 01:19:19.090]  And she talked to the manufacturers that would be manufacturing it for Canada, the US, and Britain.
[01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:25.092]  She talked to the Border Patrol guys, too, who had already implemented it on a voluntary basis back in 1998.
[01:19:26.772 --> 01:19:32.934]  And when she says, well, a lot of people won't like this, to the heads of the corporation that prints them up and makes them,
[01:19:33.832 --> 01:19:36.915]  The guy said the public will be given no option anyway.
[01:19:37.395 --> 01:19:38.376]  They'll have to take it.
[01:19:38.716 --> 01:19:44.901]  So this is a plan that was made a long time ago, and it's simply being ran through under the guise of security.
[01:19:45.641 --> 01:19:50.245]  Yeah, and meanwhile, we have the Internet being regulated at all ends.
[01:19:50.305 --> 01:19:53.887]  We have this Cybersecurity Act being introduced by Jay Rockefeller.
[01:19:54.147 --> 01:19:55.368]  We now have H.R.
[01:19:55.388 --> 01:20:01.473]  1966, the Cyberbullying Act, where really they say, oh, we have to save the children from
[01:20:01.493 --> 01:20:01.573]  Yeah.
[01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:23.432]  In five years, had a bad experience on the internet, supposedly caused their mental illness.
[01:20:23.452 --> 01:20:24.513]  We know that's not the case.
[01:20:24.713 --> 01:20:30.616]  They're probably mentally ill or just put into that subsection so that they could heavily medicate them as that's part of the plan.
[01:20:30.816 --> 01:20:35.959]  And then they say 54% of these clients were 18 years of age or younger.
[01:20:36.019 --> 01:20:37.479]  I mean, that's just ludicrous.
[01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:40.881]  So let's just shut down the internet or let's just charge people.
[01:20:40.921 --> 01:20:46.424]  They're saying that they'll be able to charge people and convict them and they'll have to do two years in prison and pay a fine.
[01:20:47.794 --> 01:20:49.415]  It's much, much bigger than that even.
[01:20:49.555 --> 01:20:53.057]  FDR said there are lies in politics.
[01:20:53.198 --> 01:20:54.338]  Then there are damned lies.
[01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:56.540]  And then there are statistics.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.162]  Because with statistics you can prove anything you want to prove, you see.
[01:21:00.182 --> 01:21:01.883]  And we don't see them as lies.
[01:21:02.203 --> 01:21:03.484]  We think it's scientific data.
[01:21:03.844 --> 01:21:05.325]  That's why they're always saying it's statistics.
[01:21:05.846 --> 01:21:07.246]  But it's just lies nonetheless.
[01:21:07.286 --> 01:21:08.167]  They have an agenda.
[01:21:08.547 --> 01:21:14.331]  The internet was put out there to get everyone on it because they could not have a totally controlled society
[01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:18.991]  Uh, without using the internet and getting us hooked on it for everything.
[01:21:19.411 --> 01:21:21.612]  Now, we're going into a world cashless society.
[01:21:21.632 --> 01:21:26.013]  We're going into a world where you can't pay your rent, your mortgage, or anything except through internet.
[01:21:26.393 --> 01:21:30.255]  So eventually, if they blacklist you, you'll be unable to pay for anything.
[01:21:30.295 --> 01:21:36.377]  You'll be an outcast, you'll be on the streets, and then they use it as a form of punishment and control on the public.
[01:21:36.417 --> 01:21:37.418]  That's why we've got it.
[01:21:38.238 --> 01:21:45.182]  And so many people are out there volunteering their information, not even realizing how serious it is.
[01:21:45.402 --> 01:21:50.365]  When you have a Facebook page, and I have a Facebook page, I have a MySpace, but I'm not constantly updating.
[01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:55.448]  People put their status on there, they literally tell their life story, what I'm doing at this minute, that minute, this minute.
[01:21:55.668 --> 01:21:58.189]  They put up pictures from every event they've ever been to.
[01:21:58.489 --> 01:22:01.051]  I've never been a big picture hound, I don't really post that much stuff.
[01:22:01.311 --> 01:22:06.674]  But they are literally creating a profile on themselves that will be data-based by this government.
[01:22:07.245 --> 01:22:10.366]  It's already been stated by the British and Canadian governments.
[01:22:10.406 --> 01:22:16.569]  They're using everything that you put up voluntarily as legal evidence, should they ever have to use it against you.
[01:22:17.589 --> 01:22:18.009]  Absolutely.
[01:22:18.029 --> 01:22:31.555]  You know, I want to go and I want to play this clip of this monster of a woman who is banned against 16 people from her country and is gleefully talking about the coming identification cards in the United Kingdom.
[01:22:31.595 --> 01:22:32.075]  Hit it, Jaren.
[01:22:34.369 --> 01:22:39.052]  The key words for me when it comes to the identity service are security and convenience.
[01:22:39.452 --> 01:22:51.999]  You know, let's be clear, we already wander quite often around the streets with large amounts of personal information, utility bills, passports, other information that we need to use at the moment to prove our identity.
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:57.883]  An identity card is a more secure and convenient way to do something that we're already having to do.
[01:22:58.323 --> 01:23:02.887]  Without actually sharing as much personal data as we now have to.
[01:23:02.907 --> 01:23:16.160]  But I think it's right as well, when we're thinking about the convenience of how you enroll your facial image, your fingerprints, both for ID cards and incidentally for biometric passports, that we make that as convenient as possible for the public.
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:21.805]  We're used in this country to having our digital photos taken for our passports in high street outlets.
[01:23:22.325 --> 01:23:28.591]  I believe that we can offer that opportunity to people to have their biometric fingerprints taken as well.
[01:23:28.611 --> 01:23:32.834]  And we can do that in a secure way, but in a way that's also convenient to people.
[01:23:36.738 --> 01:23:42.580]  Well, look, there are 70,000, by the end of this year there'll be 70,000 ID cards already in people's hands.
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:43.181]  There's already 30,000.
[01:23:43.261 --> 01:23:47.622]  They're helping foreign nationals to prove their right to be here.
[01:23:47.842 --> 01:23:51.104]  They're helping employers to be more secure that people have got the right to work.
[01:23:51.704 --> 01:23:53.525]  We're already having to prove our identity.
[01:23:53.585 --> 01:23:58.346]  I think it's the role of government to help people to do that more securely and more conveniently.
[01:23:58.727 --> 01:23:59.647]  And at the same time,
[01:24:00.007 --> 01:24:10.913]  To help people to protect their identity, so that I can be confident that somebody else isn't pretending to be me, either so that they can commit crime or even terrorism, or that they can defraud me.
[01:24:10.933 --> 01:24:16.996]  It seems to me those are the sorts of protections that government has a responsibility to put in place for its citizens.
[01:24:17.357 --> 01:24:20.618]  If the Tories don't want to take that responsibility on, that's up to them.
[01:24:20.638 --> 01:24:22.319]  They'll have to explain it to the electorate.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.862]  But for me, that's an important role of what government being on the side of the public is about.
[01:24:27.284 --> 01:24:39.491]  You see, government's here to help and protect and stop terror and she just makes up all these ludicrous lies that people are just randomly wandering around with their bills and their information and their passports.
[01:24:39.551 --> 01:24:43.433]  People carry their passports when they're leaving the country or entering another one.
[01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:47.135]  I only carry my electric bill when I'm going to pay it, Alan.
[01:24:47.175 --> 01:24:49.696]  I mean, her arguments are absolutely insane.
[01:24:50.857 --> 01:24:52.177]  Well, they're no arguments at all.
[01:24:52.277 --> 01:24:55.039]  It's just a political liar giving you the spiel.
[01:24:55.766 --> 01:24:56.566]  And that's her job.
[01:24:57.387 --> 01:25:01.969]  Politicians don't see the public as someone they're responsible to.
[01:25:02.469 --> 01:25:12.313]  They see the public as basically just a big herd that must be manipulated and lied to in order to get what's right for them, how they should behave and how they should act, etc.
[01:25:12.914 --> 01:25:16.735]  Back in the 90s, Canada and the U.S.
[01:25:17.035 --> 01:25:19.697]  and all British Commonwealth countries brought it and bought in.
[01:25:19.717 --> 01:25:22.498]  I mean, Canada alone bought five Super Cray computers.
[01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:24.652]  Australia did the same thing.
[01:25:25.193 --> 01:25:27.755]  These were owned by the post office of all places.
[01:25:28.735 --> 01:25:31.638]  And they created massive buildings for them.
[01:25:32.818 --> 01:25:38.563]  No one could tell us what they were for, because one super-crazy computer could handle all the data of everyone in the US and Canada.
[01:25:39.381 --> 01:25:43.203]  It turns out it was for the coming ID cards that we're now hearing about.
[01:25:43.464 --> 01:25:44.264]  This is back in the 90s.
[01:25:44.464 --> 01:25:46.866]  They were already building the facilities for it.
[01:25:47.266 --> 01:25:55.251]  We're simply living through an agenda, and it's the politician's job simply to con us, to go along with it, taking us under the guise of terrorism.
[01:25:55.271 --> 01:25:57.372]  Absolutely, and we'll be back to discuss that on the other side.
[01:25:57.412 --> 01:25:58.373]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:25:59.534 --> 01:26:02.795]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:26:03.035 --> 01:26:07.357]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:26:07.557 --> 01:26:15.440]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:26:15.768 --> 01:26:18.589]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:26.413]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:26:26.513 --> 01:26:32.076]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:26:32.316 --> 01:26:37.881]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:26:38.161 --> 01:26:41.463]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:26:41.704 --> 01:26:45.066]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:26:45.306 --> 01:26:50.350]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt-cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:26:50.370 --> 01:26:53.233]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:26:53.293 --> 01:26:53.473]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:26:59.989 --> 01:27:05.314]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:27:06.034 --> 01:27:11.319]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:27:11.903 --> 01:27:18.108]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:27:18.408 --> 01:27:20.229]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:22.771]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:27:22.851 --> 01:27:33.800]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:37.303]  It's not about left or right.
[01:27:37.703 --> 01:27:39.064]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:27:39.548 --> 01:27:45.896]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:27:46.456 --> 01:27:54.266]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:27:54.726 --> 01:27:55.868]  The Obama Deception.
[01:27:56.308 --> 01:27:57.490]  The people strike back.
[01:27:59.088 --> 01:28:05.314]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:28:05.755 --> 01:28:13.542]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:28:13.882 --> 01:28:19.468]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[01:28:19.788 --> 01:28:21.729]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:26.793]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:28:27.133 --> 01:28:31.856]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:28:32.356 --> 01:28:36.219]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:28:36.699 --> 01:28:37.720]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:41.863]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:28:42.303 --> 01:28:43.224]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:28:47.166 --> 01:28:49.747]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:28:50.167 --> 01:28:52.728]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:28:54.068 --> 01:28:55.828]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:28:58.529 --> 01:29:08.592]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:29:12.383 --> 01:29:12.583]  I think so.
[01:29:40.046 --> 01:29:43.669]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden In A Can.
[01:29:44.109 --> 01:29:47.211]  For more details visit GardenInACan.com today.

[01:29:50.133 --> 01:29:50.173]  866-598-7396.
[01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:16.952]  All right, folks, we are back.
[01:30:17.052 --> 01:30:19.034]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:30:19.054 --> 01:30:20.075]  I'm Jason Burmas, sitting in.
[01:30:20.095 --> 01:30:30.146]  We're joined by Alan Watt of CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com and, you know, the Bilderberg meeting, where a lot of these elites get together and really codify their agenda.
[01:30:31.769 --> 01:30:36.551]  We'll be meeting in about one week over in, uh, I think it's going to be in Greece this year.
[01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:45.894]  And we reported a couple weeks ago, uh, that I think it was, uh, Enyan Devenier saying that they had created the Euro through the Bilderberg Group.
[01:30:45.914 --> 01:30:51.476]  Now, remember, the Bilderberg Group didn't exist, and then they said, oh, it's just a golf club, and they don't set any policy there.
[01:30:51.856 --> 01:30:52.577]  Obvious lies.
[01:30:53.357 --> 01:31:06.332]  However, right now, and this is storiesoveratprisonplanet.com, leaked 1955 Bilderberg documents outline plan for a single European currency almost 40 years before it was codified in 1992.
[01:31:08.334 --> 01:31:15.740]  Now, this isn't a surprise to you or me, Alan, but it really does speak to the fact that these guys are the policy makers.
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:24.367]  They are people who believe that they are our lords, our gods, the people who should rule over us, the masses, the sheeple, the chattel, if you will.
[01:31:24.407 --> 01:31:31.412]  I mean, those are the names they call us, and this is just a further illustration that they are the puppet masters behind the scenes.
[01:31:32.833 --> 01:31:36.256]  There's certainly one of the main groups, there's no doubt about it, but even
[01:31:37.408 --> 01:31:54.737]  John Maynard Keynes in the mid-40s, when they were setting up the Bretton Woods Agreement for the monetary system, when he said this is part one, part two will be a global monetary system, he said also too that the trading blocks that they would build up from then on, because they already planned to unite Europe during World War II,
[01:31:55.983 --> 01:32:02.449]  He said that they'll bring in a unitary currency for Europe, and then one for the Americas later, and also a global currency.
[01:32:02.489 --> 01:32:07.514]  Although he said they wouldn't see the global currency in his lifetime, that would be the next century, which is now.
[01:32:08.054 --> 01:32:14.040]  But as I say, we're living through a script, and when you find their old books, you have no doubt about it whatsoever.
[01:32:15.209 --> 01:32:19.412]  So what do you think is going to be on the agenda this year at the Bilderberg Group?
[01:32:19.472 --> 01:32:20.773]  I mean, again, they meet in a week.
[01:32:21.393 --> 01:32:24.295]  In my mind, you know, there's 144 public members.
[01:32:24.596 --> 01:32:28.718]  So, you know, it's kind of like this compartmentalized group of people, very small.
[01:32:29.079 --> 01:32:34.122]  And then in another month or so, they're going to be meeting at the Bohemian Grove when you have 3,000 people there.
[01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:40.546]  And those people who are at the Bilderberg Group will give their agenda to their underlings at the Bohemian Grove.
[01:32:40.606 --> 01:32:41.447]  So you have
[01:32:41.847 --> 01:32:44.108]  A system where it's a need-to-know system.
[01:32:44.168 --> 01:32:52.653]  Some people are more in the know than others, and the people in the Bohemian Grove, most of them are less in the know, say, than those that attended the Bilderberg Conference.
[01:32:52.673 --> 01:32:56.895]  They're given an agenda, they're given a job to carry out, but they may not know why.
[01:32:58.576 --> 01:33:06.641]  And also, too, I think the big thing will be the true bringing up of the International Monetary Fund to its proper place.
[01:33:07.421 --> 01:33:11.003]  They've already admitted they're going to be the world's issuers of currency.
[01:33:11.556 --> 01:33:15.662]  That would be part one, but also the biggest part two is also population control.
[01:33:15.702 --> 01:33:23.152]  Now they're really on a roll to get the public to accept they must have population reduction by government law and order, etc.
[01:33:24.378 --> 01:33:24.898]  Absolutely.
[01:33:25.098 --> 01:33:30.500]  We played some of those clips because we had one of those heckler callers in the beginning go, oh, they want to kill 80% of us.
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.240]  Well, those are in their own documents.
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:38.581]  And you've got Ted Turner running around saying there's already too many people on the planet and we need a sustainable society.
[01:33:38.781 --> 01:33:44.883]  Then we actually have the World Sustainable Society, this organization with Gordon Brown and others, including
[01:33:45.143 --> 01:33:50.024]  The global warming czar of the Obama administration who's openly for global governance.
[01:33:50.304 --> 01:33:54.765]  And in these groups they say, well, we're just going to have to take the population down.
[01:33:54.805 --> 01:34:03.667]  We have people talking about taking the population from the UK from, it's at 60 million officially, it's probably more like 70 million, down to 30 million by 2027.
[01:34:04.908 --> 01:34:09.549]  How is that going to be possible unless they sterilize everybody and kill half the population?
[01:34:10.254 --> 01:34:11.996]  Yeah, well, they're already sterilizing people.
[01:34:12.036 --> 01:34:13.437]  They've admitted that now.
[01:34:13.497 --> 01:34:14.137]  It's happening.
[01:34:14.157 --> 01:34:15.879]  It's just a pure coincidence.
[01:34:15.899 --> 01:34:20.202]  They were putting the very agents, the sterilizers, in the water and in the food since 1950.
[01:34:21.183 --> 01:34:24.085]  And obviously the inoculations as well certainly helped along the way.
[01:34:24.706 --> 01:34:29.710]  But now they're going into, they want the rights now to mandate who can breed, who cannot breed.
[01:34:30.311 --> 01:34:32.332]  Because it's not a matter of overpopulation.
[01:34:32.352 --> 01:34:36.035]  And all those statistics, remember, have been fudged since the days of Malthus.
[01:34:36.155 --> 01:34:38.097]  He used graphs and charts and fake statistics.
[01:34:39.082 --> 01:34:41.483]  But that doesn't matter, as long as the public believe it.
[01:34:41.963 --> 01:34:45.264]  Because we must acquiesce by our silence to their demands.
[01:34:45.664 --> 01:34:48.825]  They want the right to literally sterilize people.
[01:34:49.085 --> 01:34:51.325]  And that's been in the British newspapers quite recently.
[01:34:52.125 --> 01:34:53.926]  So that's really what it's all about.
[01:34:54.226 --> 01:34:58.307]  It's not that there's too many people, it's too many of the wrong sort of people.
[01:34:58.327 --> 01:35:01.648]  You know, the ones who haven't evolved as far as those at the Bilderberger.
[01:35:02.574 --> 01:35:18.865]  Yeah, no, they honestly believe that they should rule over us, they're smarter than us, they're more intelligent than us, and then we are just, we're cannon fodder for them, and we are being groomed to be either a dead or a slave race to serve them, and I don't know about you, but I'm not going to be licking any boots, I'm not going to be sucking
[01:35:19.005 --> 01:35:25.907]  My thumb in a fetal position, just waiting for them to give me a Baxter vaccination that's going to save me from the oh-so-dangerous swine flu.
[01:35:26.307 --> 01:35:26.747]  Oh no!
[01:35:26.827 --> 01:35:28.227]  The swine flu's going to get us!
[01:35:28.507 --> 01:35:32.528]  Meanwhile, we don't have any, let me repeat this, any deaths in the United States.
[01:35:32.568 --> 01:35:35.309]  The two-year-old boy that died had chronic health problems.
[01:35:35.329 --> 01:35:36.289]  He was a premature baby.
[01:35:36.349 --> 01:35:37.229]  He was from Mexico.
[01:35:37.489 --> 01:35:44.271]  And we played you the clip where the Associated Press tries to say that swine flu killed this woman, and then they have to go, oh well, actually it didn't.
[01:35:44.331 --> 01:35:45.471]  You know, they're falling short of that.
[01:35:45.591 --> 01:35:46.372]  We'll be back after this.
[01:35:46.412 --> 01:35:47.592]  Taking your calls with Alan Wong.
[01:35:49.659 --> 01:35:52.667]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:56.297]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:36:00.498 --> 01:36:01.339]  You are a rebel.
[01:36:01.639 --> 01:36:02.039]  Admit it.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:05.182]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[01:36:05.362 --> 01:36:07.444]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[01:36:07.744 --> 01:36:11.447]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[01:36:11.687 --> 01:36:15.951]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot, and you can count your real friends on one hand.
[01:36:16.091 --> 01:36:17.031]  Well, join the club.
[01:36:17.192 --> 01:36:23.136]  Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[01:36:23.397 --> 01:36:27.480]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:28.161]  I don't think so.
[01:37:00.071 --> 01:37:04.515]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:37:04.535 --> 01:37:08.798]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[01:37:28.553 --> 01:37:34.038]  Who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs.
[01:37:34.478 --> 01:37:35.199]  That's fascism.
[01:37:35.839 --> 01:37:37.120]  It's not about left or right.
[01:37:37.521 --> 01:37:38.882]  It's about a one world government.
[01:37:39.362 --> 01:37:45.707]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:37:46.288 --> 01:37:54.094]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:54.554 --> 01:37:55.695]  The Obama Deception.
[01:37:56.116 --> 01:37:57.317]  The people strike back.
[01:37:59.071 --> 01:38:06.056]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:38:06.276 --> 01:38:10.579]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:38:10.839 --> 01:38:15.962]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:38:16.463 --> 01:38:23.567]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:38:23.988 --> 01:38:28.891]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[01:38:29.351 --> 01:38:34.815]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:38:35.196 --> 01:38:40.720]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[01:39:13.572 --> 01:39:24.158]  All right, folks, we are back.
[01:39:24.318 --> 01:39:25.359]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:39:25.399 --> 01:39:28.500]  We're joined by Alan Watt of CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[01:39:29.241 --> 01:39:35.484]  We've had some callers on for a couple hours, and I apologize for that, but we're going to take your calls right now for myself and Alan Watt.
[01:39:35.784 --> 01:39:37.525]  Let's go to Steven in Texas.
[01:39:37.545 --> 01:39:39.426]  Steven, you're on the line.
[01:39:39.466 --> 01:39:40.887]  Yeah, hey, Jason, and hey, Alan.
[01:39:41.739 --> 01:39:43.661]  I don't want you to give it out.
[01:39:43.701 --> 01:39:46.985]  We know who it is and a lot of people who are listening know who it is.
[01:39:47.125 --> 01:39:51.509]  I don't want to give him more attention than he already has.
[01:39:59.477 --> 01:40:02.780]  You know, he hasn't called in months and months and months, but it's just ridiculous.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:03.540]  I mean, come on.
[01:40:04.161 --> 01:40:06.983]  I mean, he wants to sit here and act like a child on the program.
[01:40:07.023 --> 01:40:14.569]  Meanwhile, all's we're doing is reading mainline news sources and articles and playing their own video clips with words coming out of their own mouth, Steven.
[01:40:15.569 --> 01:40:18.892]  Yeah, well, I was just gonna say, it's Moe, and his last name's Ron.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.101]  Yes, I agree.
[01:40:34.915 --> 01:40:39.278]  You know, it's funny because I even had somebody from the post office call me back.
[01:40:39.318 --> 01:40:42.800]  I had to go down there and pick up a package because they screwed up a delivery.
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:51.446]  And so the way they called me, and this is what I'm doing, I'm talking about being proactive because we've got this mentality, I'm only one person, what can I do?
[01:40:52.507 --> 01:40:58.872]  Well, there's one person that you work with there that started that whole thing, and look what's happened as a result to what Alex has done.
[01:40:58.912 --> 01:41:02.055]  Well, this woman from the post office, I just happened to meet her.
[01:41:02.115 --> 01:41:06.439]  I said, hey, before you go, I just want to ask you, are you concerned about the economy?
[01:41:06.599 --> 01:41:07.419]  And she said, yeah.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:10.362]  And I said, well, would you like to know what's behind it?
[01:41:10.422 --> 01:41:11.283]  And she said, sure.
[01:41:11.723 --> 01:41:12.684]  And I said, okay.
[01:41:12.884 --> 01:41:14.325]  And I gave her info wars.
[01:41:14.425 --> 01:41:16.147]  I told her about the Obama deception.
[01:41:16.207 --> 01:41:18.409]  I gave her Jason Burmiss and Alex Jones.
[01:41:18.889 --> 01:41:19.350]  I don't think so.
[01:41:35.863 --> 01:41:41.048]  Overall, I'm more and more open to listen because of the crisis that we're in.
[01:41:41.468 --> 01:41:55.800]  I've got a guy recently who is a good personal friend of mine, and this is what's really disappointing, but he's been an exception where I actually emailed a link to the article on InfoWars about Ashley, this kid, this 16-year-old kid.
[01:41:57.922 --> 01:42:02.426]  Uh, that was taken by DHS, you know, two months ago in North Carolina.
[01:42:02.546 --> 01:42:06.951]  But you gotta understand, Wire just did a story bashing Alex Jones, saying it doesn't exist.
[01:42:07.051 --> 01:42:09.113]  Oh, he wasn't arrested under the Patriot Act.
[01:42:09.593 --> 01:42:11.956]  Oh, you know, you can't fake an IP address.
[01:42:11.976 --> 01:42:12.476]  Give me a break.
[01:42:12.516 --> 01:42:14.638]  They went in in the middle of the night jackboot cops.
[01:42:14.658 --> 01:42:16.300]  He hasn't been able to talk to his mother since.
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:18.042]  What else could they be charging him with?
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:29.392]  Yeah, and the thing is, but this friend emails me back, he says, well, I appreciate you sending this to me and thinking about me, but I don't adhere to these radical views, so please don't send me any more of that kind of stuff.
[01:42:29.412 --> 01:42:38.523]  So what I do, I took like over an hour and I gave him a ton of details because he says, I definitely don't agree with you saying that the Bush family are a crime syndicate.
[01:42:38.983 --> 01:42:44.827]  And I just gave him a ton of stuff that I knew, and I haven't heard back from him since, so hopefully it'll give him enough to think about.
[01:42:44.847 --> 01:42:53.752]  But overall, I found people are being more and more receptive to this message, because they know something's up, and they can see that there's something that's going down.
[01:42:53.772 --> 01:43:01.177]  And I've told people, if you don't wake up very soon, we're not going to have any United States of America, as we know we're going to be under a totally bleak state.
[01:43:01.217 --> 01:43:01.597]  Absolutely, Steven.
[01:43:01.657 --> 01:43:04.138]  And we do have to be proactive, my friend, and I thank you for the call.
[01:43:04.158 --> 01:43:05.859]  Let's jump to Bob in Wisconsin.
[01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:06.620]  Bob, you're on the line.
[01:43:08.081 --> 01:43:08.341]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:10.609 --> 01:43:11.630]  Once, twice, Bob?
[01:43:12.490 --> 01:43:14.371]  Alright, Junior in New York, you're on the air.
[01:43:16.172 --> 01:43:17.073]  Hi Junior, can you hear me?
[01:43:17.473 --> 01:43:17.853]  Yes sir.
[01:43:18.994 --> 01:43:30.660]  Alright, basically they passed through my neighborhood the other day doing the census and I wasn't here but my neighbor was here and I was curious, like, what could these GPS coordinates be for?
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.822]  I know that you guys are saying SWAT teams, but really they could be...
[01:43:34.242 --> 01:43:35.843]  Listen, I don't want to say SWAT teams.
[01:43:36.363 --> 01:43:38.744]  That might be something that Alex Jones has said.
[01:43:39.405 --> 01:43:47.829]  Obviously they can use GPS coordinates if they want to get to your house and you're off the grid and use SWAT against you if you're a terrorist, underlined in this DHS document.
[01:43:47.849 --> 01:43:53.011]  But what it is, is to create this massive control grid to document everybody's home.
[01:43:53.051 --> 01:44:00.254]  And that's why the Census Bureau is going to every single house and GPSing outside of your house 40 feet at the least.
[01:44:00.575 --> 01:44:01.655]  Alan, why don't you talk about that?
[01:44:01.695 --> 01:44:02.536]  What do you think some of the...
[01:44:03.954 --> 01:44:19.477]  Um, I wanted to actually ask Alan, because I know he knows, I never really, uh, I just wanted to know if he thinks that there's any possibility that they could be using these coordinates with HAARP to zap targeted houses or, you know, if they have certain people that they want to hit with the HAARP.
[01:44:19.938 --> 01:44:22.600]  Look, before Alan answers that, Alan, I want you to answer that in a second.
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:31.045]  I want you to answer that in a second, but I just want to say this, you know, they're creating a database and a control grid so they know who to go after.
[01:44:31.085 --> 01:44:36.808]  I don't think it has, you know, much to do with, oh, we're going to GPS everybody and now we're going to use HAARP weapons against them.
[01:44:36.848 --> 01:44:45.513]  No, they want to database everybody first, put you into different subcategories, see who the real threats are, see who the free thinkers are, and then take action from there.
[01:44:45.793 --> 01:44:46.614]  Alan, what's your take?
[01:44:47.378 --> 01:44:58.722]  Back in the 70s, I talked to a guy who worked for the British Secret Service, and he told me he had a heart attack, a young fellow, and he changed employment.
[01:44:58.742 --> 01:45:09.987]  He was teaching at universities, and he just mentioned one day that shortly there'll be a grid system that's already underway, set up for tracking via satellite everyone's homes,
[01:45:10.692 --> 01:45:21.056]  And he said, right now, and that's true, at that time, we were all being trained to put down our postal codes, even though the postal codes were not used by the post office for another 15 years.
[01:45:21.576 --> 01:45:29.799]  He says, we're presently training the public to always write their postal code, he says, because eventually everyone will be categorized under various codes.
[01:45:30.119 --> 01:45:31.039]  That's all he would say.
[01:45:31.559 --> 01:45:35.361]  What he really meant, I think, was political codes, etc., viewpoints, and so on.
[01:45:35.761 --> 01:45:37.481]  So that was part of it, and that was literally 1972.
[01:45:40.143 --> 01:45:42.765]  I mean, I think this is just an extension of the control grid, don't you?
[01:45:42.805 --> 01:45:44.906]  I mean, they want to get people that are off the grid.
[01:45:45.467 --> 01:45:54.593]  They want you to be a part of this huge control grid where they can zoom in on your house from a satellite, they know exactly where you live, who you are, and they have that data.
[01:45:54.613 --> 01:46:02.819]  They have the data, and they do flyovers too, and if they want to check out your house, they can infrared it and see what's in it and all the rest of it.
[01:46:02.879 --> 01:46:04.580]  There's a whole bunch of reasons they can use it.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:07.442]  But also remember, they're always working on the future.
[01:46:08.243 --> 01:46:23.257]  And in the future for Agenda 21, depending on where you are and which region and area you're in, and they do have regions marked down across the US and Canada, they want to get us all off over the next 15, 16 years off the land and into the overcrowded cities.
[01:46:23.357 --> 01:46:28.522]  So it'll probably all tie together many functions all in one, the one thing going on right now.
[01:46:29.142 --> 01:46:30.704]  I'll be part to do with that as well.
[01:46:31.024 --> 01:46:38.273]  Also remember they're going after the US just passing that law put that law through where they own all water in the United States internally.
[01:46:38.971 --> 01:46:43.214]  So if you happen to be on top of a nice deep well or something like that, they might just want that.
[01:46:43.775 --> 01:46:45.796]  Or they might not let you have access to your own water.
[01:46:45.976 --> 01:46:47.958]  There's a whole bunch of reasons that they're doing this for.
[01:46:47.978 --> 01:46:50.640]  It's all data collection for every facet of your life.
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:54.483]  Well, let's say they also pass this bill where you're not supposed to have an organic farm.
[01:46:54.523 --> 01:47:03.830]  It's going to be a lot easier for them, once they GPS your house, realize how big it is, to just check their satellite and say, oh my god, this guy's got a victory garden, he's a terrorist, let's go get him.
[01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:08.113]  I mean, it's a total surveillance, total control grid, and that's why they want that information.
[01:47:08.618 --> 01:47:18.685]  Yes, and that was all part of the Star Wars, the real Star Wars program was all for the future, which is now, and what's coming up, and tracking and coordinating, etc.
[01:47:18.985 --> 01:47:19.885]  It's all part of it.
[01:47:19.925 --> 01:47:31.693]  So when they come to you personally and do it in your home, remember even the guy who reads your electric meter punches that little GPS satellite when he punches in the meter readings, he also punches in where he is.
[01:47:31.713 --> 01:47:33.674]  So they've been doing this for years.
[01:47:34.535 --> 01:47:35.055]  Absolutely.
[01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:37.156]  Let's jump to Devin in California.
[01:47:37.176 --> 01:47:37.817]  Devin, you're on the air.
[01:47:39.505 --> 01:47:41.246]  Hey, how you doing guys?
[01:47:41.366 --> 01:47:46.407]  Hey, I just wanted to go over a few things.
[01:47:46.447 --> 01:47:47.028]  I was in the U.S.
[01:47:47.048 --> 01:47:47.488]  military.
[01:47:47.508 --> 01:47:55.851]  I got out in 2004, and I'll tell you, when I went to boot camp in Arizona, South Carolina, we had tons
[01:48:08.351 --> 01:48:08.852]  I think so.
[01:48:25.897 --> 01:48:30.499]  Hold on one second, I just want you to speak to that.
[01:48:30.839 --> 01:48:41.004]  Why don't you explain to people, Alan, how we are now being, you know, our military is being integrated with NATO and foreign military forces for this new global system.
[01:48:42.105 --> 01:48:49.088]  Well, under the plan for, I think it was called Fortress America, it was in the papers maybe three years ago, or 2005 in fact,
[01:48:51.098 --> 01:48:57.183]  They said that the Canadian forces, US, Mexican and other Latin American countries were already amalgamating.
[01:48:57.744 --> 01:49:08.553]  But the second part of it all was, you've seen it in the paper too, that not only will they eat the whole of America's amalgamate, but now to amalgamate also with the European Union community.
[01:49:09.334 --> 01:49:12.216]  So they're creating a new world army.
[01:49:12.376 --> 01:49:14.858]  That's been in the press in the European papers.
[01:49:15.939 --> 01:49:16.720]  A world army
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:21.903]  And every country will send members to it to be part of this world army.
[01:49:22.623 --> 01:49:23.724]  So this is all part of it.
[01:49:23.744 --> 01:49:25.084]  It's a multicultural force.
[01:49:25.665 --> 01:49:44.055]  I think about 15 years ago in the Council on Foreign Relations' own magazine, Foreign Affairs, they said it had world meetings to discuss how to create this new world army because it was one thing, it was easier to get you to stand up for your old tribal emblems, your flag, etc., the songs and all that.
[01:49:44.699 --> 01:49:45.039]  I don't know.
[01:50:04.145 --> 01:50:13.488]  And create the brotherhood idea that they're special, more special than the civilians, then they hope to use these techniques to bind them together into a truly international force.
[01:50:13.508 --> 01:50:14.229]  So it's quite right.
[01:50:14.769 --> 01:50:15.629]  We're going through that now.
[01:50:15.649 --> 01:50:16.889]  We have been for quite a few years.
[01:50:17.490 --> 01:50:19.650]  Yeah, but it's really in full force right now.
[01:50:19.710 --> 01:50:32.895]  I mean, we're talking about, you know, earlier today we talked about Marine Corps, civilian police, and we have another military guy call in and say, yeah, a lot of my guys are getting deployed and now it's dudes who are making $14 an hour who we hire off the street, not the MPs anymore.
[01:50:33.155 --> 01:50:36.537]  And that's because they are, first of all, integrating a police state here at home.
[01:50:36.577 --> 01:50:39.419]  They're trying to blur the lines between the military and the police.
[01:50:39.439 --> 01:50:41.099]  They're trying to get rid of Posi Comitatus.
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:59.690]  And they're getting us ready for global government and a global military force that you're going to see at the National Level Exercise 09 coming up at the end of July into the beginning of August, headed by FEMA, you know, working with the UK, Australia, Canada, and Mexico in a Terrorist Prevention Act.
[01:51:00.330 --> 01:51:05.635]  Like no one has ever seen, this is the first drill to prevent terror after terrorism occurs in another country.
[01:51:05.855 --> 01:51:08.177]  Let's jump to our next caller, Anne in New York.
[01:51:08.197 --> 01:51:08.797]  You're on the line.
[01:51:08.817 --> 01:51:22.349]  All right, I just want to say that I'm new to you and I'm so proud that you are doing what you're doing, that there's a place, that there's a voice that we can hear that is just focusing on what's really going on.
[01:51:22.369 --> 01:51:23.229]  Well, thank you.
[01:51:23.249 --> 01:51:23.890]  And thank you.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:25.120]  I'm going
[01:51:54.815 --> 01:51:58.181]  And it makes you put down your driver's license number on this form.
[01:51:58.482 --> 01:52:05.795]  Well right now Canada is enforcing a new ID system where if you take the new ID card I think they're going to be issuing them on June 1st.
[01:52:07.342 --> 01:52:08.203]  No, no, I understand that.
[01:52:08.443 --> 01:52:10.165]  But right now, well, they're trying to blur the line.
[01:52:10.185 --> 01:52:11.906]  They're trying to create this North American Union.
[01:52:12.106 --> 01:52:16.670]  So if you take your RFID, national ID card in Canada, then you won't have to wait in the border.
[01:52:16.710 --> 01:52:17.451]  You'll just have your thing.
[01:52:17.511 --> 01:52:18.292]  Oh, you got your card?
[01:52:18.312 --> 01:52:18.872]  Go ahead.
[01:52:18.892 --> 01:52:21.454]  And they're going to do the same thing in Mexico and America.
[01:52:21.495 --> 01:52:25.198]  They want to integrate this into a new system.
[01:52:25.538 --> 01:52:29.301]  And that was exposed in the Security and Prosperity Partnership Agreements.
[01:52:29.321 --> 01:52:31.023]  Why don't you speak to that really quickly there, Alan.
[01:52:32.052 --> 01:52:39.114]  Yes, and also the EU have said that they have a central computer with all the data of Canadians and the US citizens who have that card.
[01:52:39.534 --> 01:52:43.394]  So it is in actual fact an international, it's your international ID card.
[01:52:43.955 --> 01:52:44.395]  Exactly.
[01:52:44.735 --> 01:52:49.896]  It even said that in it, it could go under the guise of a license, it doesn't matter, it is the international ID card.
[01:52:50.256 --> 01:52:50.656]  Exactly.
[01:52:50.756 --> 01:52:51.616]  Anne, what else you got for me?
[01:52:52.716 --> 01:52:53.197]  It's here.
[01:52:53.217 --> 01:52:54.297]  Yeah.
[01:52:54.837 --> 01:52:56.157]  And that's the frightening part.
[01:52:56.557 --> 01:52:59.718]  You know, and I'm just so glad you're alerting more and more Americans.
[01:53:00.256 --> 01:53:01.578]  And this Bill H.R.
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.082]  875, how realistic is that?
[01:53:04.142 --> 01:53:15.119]  I mean, I've sent letters to the New York Times, to Eden Foods, to every organic group that I can think of, and any response I've gotten back from organic farmers is that they've never even heard of this.
[01:53:15.441 --> 01:53:16.962]  Well, that's absolutely correct.
[01:53:16.982 --> 01:53:20.443]  They haven't heard of it and they're keeping it on the low, but it's as real as it gets.
[01:53:20.703 --> 01:53:25.344]  They always talk about it after they've passed some kind of legislation towards it.
[01:53:25.925 --> 01:53:31.387]  They have programmed us to think that GMO foods are going to save us and you don't need organic farming.
[01:53:31.427 --> 01:53:39.469]  In fact, organic farming is bad because it doesn't go through the proper processes and that's the reason we have swine flu and bird flu outbreaks and people are unhealthy.
[01:53:39.769 --> 01:53:41.350]  Meanwhile, these GMO foods
[01:53:41.670 --> 01:53:46.814]  are set out to destroy our immune systems, to really hurt us, to sterilize us.
[01:53:47.094 --> 01:53:47.934]  Speak to that, Alan.
[01:53:48.855 --> 01:53:51.196]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:53:51.257 --> 01:53:55.960]  And I read from their own articles, the big players, on depopulation agendas.
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:59.162]  I keep asking the public, what do you think they mean by that?
[01:53:59.582 --> 01:54:03.685]  Just a wish list of things they'd love to do at Christmas time in Santa Claus.
[01:54:04.045 --> 01:54:05.146]  They actually implement them.
[01:54:06.026 --> 01:54:08.487]  You cannot ask for volunteers, so you simply implement them.
[01:54:08.807 --> 01:54:10.307]  And you're quite right for the GMO food.
[01:54:10.967 --> 01:54:12.988]  I mean, look at all the guys behind Obama.
[01:54:13.008 --> 01:54:16.769]  He's even got guys there who work for Monsanto on his staff there.
[01:54:16.829 --> 01:54:19.690]  And in fact, they put the bills forward for this particular one.
[01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:24.331]  And we've had it from the Economic Union, we've had it from Britain, from all the Prime Ministers.
[01:54:24.651 --> 01:54:29.052]  They want the GMO to be the sole ruler, basically, food-wise, for the whole planet.
[01:54:29.472 --> 01:54:30.832]  That's the way it's been mandated.
[01:54:30.892 --> 01:54:33.313]  That's why no one can sue Monsanto anywhere.
[01:54:34.191 --> 01:54:37.432]  Uh, that's why doors open for Monsanto and judges know to leave them alone.
[01:54:37.812 --> 01:54:42.873]  It's a must-be, because as far as I'm concerned, you see, food comes under military-industrial complex.
[01:54:42.933 --> 01:54:44.153]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[01:54:44.233 --> 01:54:46.213]  Control the food or the water, you control the people.
[01:54:46.733 --> 01:54:50.654]  Therefore, uh, Monsanto is part of the military-industrial complex.
[01:54:51.214 --> 01:54:54.555]  Absolutely, and Anne, I hope you look into Codex Alimentarius.
[01:54:54.575 --> 01:54:56.255]  There's a lot of scary things within that.
[01:54:56.295 --> 01:54:57.175]  I thank you for the call.
[01:54:57.195 --> 01:54:58.855]  Let's jump to Johnny in Indiana.
[01:54:58.895 --> 01:54:59.655]  Johnny, you're on the line.
[01:55:01.556 --> 01:55:01.876]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:01.916 --> 01:55:02.316]  Hello, Jason.
[01:55:02.336 --> 01:55:03.156]  Can you hear me?
[01:55:03.513 --> 01:55:03.873]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:04.934 --> 01:55:07.735]  I wanted to comment about the Ashton Lumbee case.
[01:55:08.475 --> 01:55:08.776]  Okay.
[01:55:09.916 --> 01:55:24.263]  It's here in my town in Southern Indiana, and I heard about it on your show, and I became actively involved in her case, and I brought it to the attention of all my media outlets, and it created such an outcry that the U.S.
[01:55:24.343 --> 01:55:26.524]  Attorney had to respond with a press release.
[01:55:26.824 --> 01:55:27.504]  And what did they say?
[01:55:28.625 --> 01:55:29.505]  They downplayed it.
[01:55:30.586 --> 01:55:32.547]  They commented on the charges, and
[01:55:33.394 --> 01:55:37.038]  And I talked to Annette at least three times a day since I heard about the case.
[01:55:38.139 --> 01:55:46.367]  And they commented on what he was being charged with, and they said that she had access to her child, but that never bothered to go see him.
[01:55:47.467 --> 01:55:56.489]  You know, again, you know, I've got to know more about this case, but I don't think it's right that you come in the middle of the night, you pick up a 16-year-old kid because of a supposed bomb threat.
[01:55:56.969 --> 01:56:01.169]  The kid seems to have an alibi, the mother's telling a different story from what the authorities are telling.
[01:56:01.469 --> 01:56:07.210]  You know, time will tell whether this pans out or not, and you know, I encourage people to go check into it themselves.
[01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:10.671]  Let's jump to Bill in, uh, what do we got, Bill in Connecticut?
[01:56:10.851 --> 01:56:11.311]  You're on the air.
[01:56:12.471 --> 01:56:13.151]  Yeah, Connecticut.
[01:56:13.512 --> 01:56:13.612]  Yep.
[01:56:13.632 --> 01:56:14.892]  How you doing, Jason?
[01:56:15.352 --> 01:56:15.872]  How you doing, sir?
[01:56:16.465 --> 01:56:16.665]  Good.
[01:56:17.385 --> 01:56:20.686]  Hey, a couple things pertaining to HR 875.
[01:56:21.346 --> 01:56:30.368]  I was just trying to find it here because I was going to email it over to you, but I actually got a response back from Jim Himes pertaining to that because Delorosa, what's her name?
[01:56:30.388 --> 01:56:32.008]  Delorosa, or Rosa?
[01:56:32.028 --> 01:56:33.069]  I think Delorosa, yeah.
[01:56:33.089 --> 01:56:36.829]  Delorosa Deloro was the woman who put that out.
[01:56:37.209 --> 01:56:43.431]  And I thought it was interesting because in his response, he was basically saying that she was not married to
[01:56:45.151 --> 01:56:47.334]  You know, one of the guys that actually works at Monsanto?
[01:56:48.455 --> 01:56:49.436]  His name's Greenberg.
[01:56:50.117 --> 01:56:51.599]  But she is married to this guy, right?
[01:56:52.019 --> 01:56:53.201]  Hold over on the other side.
[01:56:53.361 --> 01:56:54.322]  We'll be back after this.
[01:56:54.542 --> 01:56:55.684]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:56:55.704 --> 01:56:58.067]  We're with Alan Watt, cutting through thematrix.com.
[01:56:59.629 --> 01:57:02.232]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:57:02.839 --> 01:57:05.822]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:57:06.182 --> 01:57:09.585]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:57:09.946 --> 01:57:16.151]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:57:16.532 --> 01:57:21.596]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[01:57:21.757 --> 01:57:28.463]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:29.661]  Need something more?
[01:57:29.861 --> 01:57:33.524]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[01:57:33.824 --> 01:57:41.870]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy and tactical gear.
[01:57:42.130 --> 01:57:46.474]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off of your order and a free self-defense keychain.
[01:57:46.894 --> 01:57:50.518]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:58:06.292 --> 01:58:11.654]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:58:12.175 --> 01:58:18.377]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:58:18.697 --> 01:58:20.478]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:58:20.638 --> 01:58:23.019]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:58:23.099 --> 01:58:33.924]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:58:36.292 --> 01:58:37.553]  It's not about left or right.
[01:58:37.953 --> 01:58:39.334]  It's about a one world government.
[01:58:39.815 --> 01:58:46.160]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:54.506]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:54.987 --> 01:58:56.128]  The Obama Deception.
[01:58:56.568 --> 01:58:57.749]  The people strike back.
[01:58:59.807 --> 01:59:03.352]  Hi, my name is MZ, owner of KSCO in Santa Cruz, California.
[01:59:03.532 --> 01:59:09.400]  And like Alex Jones, I'm passionate about talk radio, that great bastion of freedom of expression for us all.
[01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:16.470]  I'm also passionate about helping people know the joys, benefits, and surprisingly simple methods of becoming entrepreneurs who work for themselves
[01:59:16.650 --> 01:59:23.434]  And not as wage slaves for someone else, or even worse, for large companies with no heart and soul, nor loyalty to their employees.
[01:59:23.614 --> 01:59:42.784]  If you are tired of being dependent on others for a living, and ready to start owning yourself, loving your work, and setting the sky as the limit for your earning potential, I want you to know about an exciting great business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that actually helps people lose weight and can help them make money, perhaps lots of it, just by helping us spread the word about this wonderful unique product.
[01:59:42.864 --> 01:59:45.666]  Get on the web and go to www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:59:45.726 --> 01:59:47.807]  That's www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:59:47.907 --> 01:59:49.108]  And check out our opportunity.
[01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:50.469]  You'll know pretty quick if you're interested.
[01:59:50.529 --> 01:59:52.830]  If you are, we will connect with you and get you up and running.
[01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:56.253]  We don't want any money from you and you'll be amazed at how simple this system is.
[01:59:56.333 --> 01:59:58.414]  Remember www.chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:59:58.434 --> 02:00:08.701]  While you were sleeping They came and took it all away
[02:00:17.526 --> 02:00:20.752]  Alright folks, we are back!
[02:00:30.905 --> 02:00:32.606]  It's the Info Warrior with Jason Burmess.
[02:00:32.686 --> 02:00:33.246]  I'm just kidding.
[02:00:33.306 --> 02:00:34.326]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:34.346 --> 02:00:38.367]  But I do a show called that and I'll be live on the air tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:00:39.207 --> 02:00:40.608]  We're going to be going over a bunch of news.
[02:00:40.648 --> 02:00:43.329]  We just got one of the census forms, so I'm going to be hitting that up.
[02:00:43.349 --> 02:00:47.490]  I missed so much today, including, let me see, what did I miss?
[02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:50.471]  666 Goldman's latest bonus bears the mark of the beast.
[02:00:50.751 --> 02:00:54.572]  Clause vetoes Czech Republic approval of the Lisbon Treaty.
[02:00:54.992 --> 02:00:58.894]  I just emailed that to Rob D., so I emailed you a copy of the letter that I had gotten from Jim Himes.
[02:01:19.212 --> 02:01:27.618]  He's basically sitting there saying that he's going to vote this down and so on and so forth, but he actually did address that thing in there pertaining to her husband.
[02:01:27.658 --> 02:01:28.559]  I called his office.
[02:01:29.019 --> 02:01:31.421]  Well, whether they're related or not, this is a bad bill.
[02:01:31.461 --> 02:01:32.982]  We should be able to go on our own.
[02:01:33.322 --> 02:01:34.163]  Oh, it's an awful bill.
[02:01:34.183 --> 02:01:34.543]  You're right.
[02:01:34.563 --> 02:01:37.806]  It's off the charts awful, and we do need to oppose it.
[02:01:38.106 --> 02:01:39.267]  I thank you for the call, Bill.
[02:01:40.248 --> 02:01:42.970]  Alan, what are your closing thoughts on this bill?
[02:01:42.990 --> 02:01:44.871]  I mean, a lot of people are obviously concerned.
[02:01:45.392 --> 02:01:49.174]  You know, we don't want Monsanto in charge of our food consumption, do we?
[02:01:50.715 --> 02:01:55.599]  No, but I think, to be honest with you, it already is.
[02:01:57.526 --> 02:02:07.795]  Monsanto, Aker, Daniels, Midlands and a few others, there's five of them all together, were set up to take over and be the big agribusiness companies for the entire planet.
[02:02:08.196 --> 02:02:11.619]  They're in every country across the planet doing the same things at the same time.
[02:02:12.339 --> 02:02:22.769]  And we've had top politicians, prime ministers, come out in Europe saying that they're going to make it, give a complete go-ahead to be GMO, everything GMO,
[02:02:23.726 --> 02:02:33.016]  The United Nations, remember, the Department of Agriculture said when they were set up that their job eventually was to distribute all food across the world to every block.
[02:02:33.637 --> 02:02:36.120]  That's the US block, the European block, etc.
[02:02:37.061 --> 02:02:40.985]  And they said that that will be used as coercion to bring down their populations.
[02:02:41.005 --> 02:02:43.908]  You won't get more rations if you have more populations.
[02:02:43.928 --> 02:02:44.729]  They'll simply reduce it.
[02:02:45.863 --> 02:02:53.925]  So, it's used as a weapon, and the woman who was in charge of the UN at that time for that department said that food has always been used as a weapon.
[02:02:54.426 --> 02:03:02.208]  Well, God understand it still is, and the old ideas of freedom and being self-sufficient are under the hammer because
[02:03:02.728 --> 02:03:02.948]  I think so.
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:23.261]  Quarantine you, vaccinate you, and kill you if they want.
[02:03:23.601 --> 02:03:24.481]  That's the bottom line.
[02:03:24.741 --> 02:03:26.121]  Alan Watt, thank you for joining us.
[02:03:26.161 --> 02:03:28.462]  The website is CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[02:03:28.662 --> 02:03:31.502]  Remember, the rebroadcast starts in about 90 seconds.
[02:03:31.522 --> 02:03:33.723]  We talked about the census GPS.
[02:03:33.743 --> 02:03:35.283]  We talked about the flu vaccine.
[02:03:35.503 --> 02:03:40.484]  We talked about the internet dying, the cyberbullying bill, the Cybersecurity Act.
[02:03:40.504 --> 02:03:43.325]  We talked about the Bilderberg documents that have recently leaked.
[02:03:44.005 --> 02:03:47.008]  And admit that they created the Euro, folks.
[02:03:47.208 --> 02:03:50.472]  All this stuff and more on the rebroadcast in about 90 seconds.
[02:03:50.512 --> 02:03:55.958]  If you missed any of it, we've got stories at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[02:03:56.758 --> 02:03:58.720]  In this last minute, I want to introduce everybody.
[02:03:59.301 --> 02:04:08.326]  To the latest member of the Prison Planet family, there she is, she's Little Jenny Justice, the Pitbull of PrisonPlanet.tv, and I love her very much.
[02:04:08.386 --> 02:04:12.389]  She guards me by my side when I'm not strapped, folks, and I'm never strapped.
[02:04:12.409 --> 02:04:17.571]  So, again, I do my own little show, 9 to midnight, here at the GCN Network, and I hope you tune in.
[02:04:17.592 --> 02:04:19.893]  We're going to be covering all this and more, taking your phone calls.
[02:04:20.253 --> 02:04:22.074]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:04:22.374 --> 02:04:23.275]  God bless you all!
[02:04:40.117 --> 02:04:41.498]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:04:49.261 --> 02:04:49.841]  Hello, friends.
[02:04:49.901 --> 02:04:50.841]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:04:50.961 --> 02:04:55.623]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:04:55.703 --> 02:04:58.444]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:04:58.664 --> 02:05:01.526]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:05:01.706 --> 02:05:07.548]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:05:07.768 --> 02:05:10.730]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:05:11.010 --> 02:05:17.935]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:05:18.015 --> 02:05:21.117]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:05:21.277 --> 02:05:21.497]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:05:21.537 --> 02:05:22.958]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
