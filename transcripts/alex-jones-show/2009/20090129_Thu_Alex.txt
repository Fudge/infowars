[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.530]  Federal Agents!
[00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.431]  We are armed!
[00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:09.196]  Here I'm coming for your guns, knocking on your door.
[00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:13.580]  We're here for your possession of illegal firearms.
[00:00:26.053 --> 00:00:27.935]  All the semi-autos will be banned.
[00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:29.696]  Everyone else will be registered.
[00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:35.040]  Anybody with any psychological thing in their life, you have a car wreck, they say, oh, I'm giving you a prescription at the hospital for Prozac.
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.341]  You've got post-traumatic.
[00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:37.002]  You don't really.
[00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:38.183]  No more Second Amendment.
[00:00:39.364 --> 00:00:41.685]  This will dwarf the 68 Gun Control Act, everything.
[00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:44.307]  This is Chicago, big city crime machine.
[00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:49.131]  They like their slaves disarmed so they can then have their mafia police feed on the slaves.
[00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:52.774]  Like every day, I watch.
[00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:54.696]  Call them all suckas.
[00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.527]  Ah, Kurt Nemo is in studio with us visiting for the week.
[00:01:01.013 --> 00:01:04.095]  Yeah, you're not going to find me being a sucker going for the scam.
[00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:04.716]  What about you?
[00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:05.756]  No way!
[00:01:06.017 --> 00:01:07.378]  We know 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:01:07.418 --> 00:01:08.699]  Kurt, we're going to go to you in a moment.
[00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.562]  I wanted to finish up with Ted Anderson, who just went live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:25.871]  Ted Anderson, bottom line, you are selling gold at the price of the market at $75-$80 less than what it should be priced at per ounce.
[00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:30.314]  And that's just the bottom line because you buy it when it's low and you sell it when it's low and when it's high.
[00:01:30.754 --> 00:01:33.516]  So folks can move on this now and get an incredible deal.
[00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:33.796]  800-686-2237.
[00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:45.644]  Did you ever think you'd see the Wall Street Journal market watch saying, world government's good, we need a world government, and we need to have a North American Union, only it will save us.
[00:01:45.664 --> 00:01:50.267]  You know, two years ago it was in the secret SPP documents they were going to say, use a crisis to get it.
[00:01:50.687 --> 00:01:52.188]  Now here are the bastards doing it, Ted.
[00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:54.312]  They're just doing it right out.
[00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:55.575]  I mean, that's just the thing.
[00:01:55.896 --> 00:02:02.412]  It is surprising to see it as blatant as it is in one sense, but then in the other sense, if you just looked underneath, if you could...
[00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:07.891]  Have half the sense to read between the lines of what was being published out there, you could see it there too.
[00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:15.559]  They've just gotten to the point now where people are so dumbed down that they look at this and they say, hail to Obama, let's do this.
[00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.701]  I mean, come on.
[00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:23.748]  Well yeah, the whole new religion is stalled, everybody hates Bush, the hatred of Bush translates into Obama who's their man, and so suddenly, okay,
[00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:46.193]  We didn't like it when Bush was doing it, but we love it when you're doing it, and the whole agenda, and as we said in these first six months, is the key, is just surging, gun control, open borders, more wars, increase in troops in the Middle East and Central Asia, just total tyranny, openly announcing world government saying it'll save you, and Obama's new banker bailout is to set up this new world government bank that will tax us.
[00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:49.334]  Folks, give Ted's brokers a call, protect yourselves today,
[00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:52.215]  They're going to steal your 401Ks, your bank accounts.
[00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:53.335]  They're doing it through inflation.
[00:02:53.635 --> 00:02:54.516]  Protect yourselves.
[00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:54.696]  800-686-2237.
[00:02:54.816 --> 00:02:58.337]  Ted, good talking to you.
[00:02:58.517 --> 00:02:59.857]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[00:03:00.037 --> 00:03:00.337]  You bet.
[00:03:00.738 --> 00:03:07.840]  Kurt Nemo in studio here in Austin, Texas with us, visiting from where he works and runs InfoWars.com for us.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:21.969]  A lot of folks we have are contractors here, but Kurt is actually an employee of InfoWars.com and I saw the great work he was doing for years and got him on the team now about a year and a half ago, and it's good to have Kurt Nemo here with us, a great guy that redesigned InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.332]  Kurt, this is a short segment, we're coming back in a long one, but that first question
[00:03:26.132 --> 00:03:34.281]  We always talked about the jump point, when they finally went with the camps and the gun control and the open borders and the world bankings, and we had all their documents, we knew what it would be.
[00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:37.564]  Now it's emerged, what is the public going to do?
[00:03:37.624 --> 00:03:40.687]  Are they going to just be hypnotized by Obama and walk right into the New World Order?
[00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:42.750]  Well, I think most of the public's oblivious.
[00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.932]  They don't have any clue what's going on.
[00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:46.574]  They don't pay attention to any of this stuff.
[00:03:47.174 --> 00:03:51.316]  Or they remember the old propaganda that it didn't exist, and so they're kind of like Robbie the Robot.
[00:03:51.336 --> 00:03:54.278]  You go, well, here's the Wall Street Journal and New York Times saying world government's good and they're doing it.
[00:03:54.478 --> 00:03:58.900]  They go, cannot compute, cannot compute, smoke starts coming out, it does not exist, but they say it does.
[00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:00.281]  Wally, I, oh.
[00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:01.062]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:04:01.662 --> 00:04:06.725]  That's okay, they're plugged into CNN and Fox News and they don't talk about any of this stuff there, so what do they know?
[00:04:07.285 --> 00:04:12.488]  Unless they listen to Alex Jones, or read stuff on the web, they don't know anything about this stuff.
[00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:20.229]  What about, I mean, is the FBI going to apologize for all those training manuals for police saying, if you talk about a new world order or a world government, you're a terrorist?
[00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.171]  No, absolutely not.
[00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:23.812]  The FBI doesn't apologize for anything.
[00:04:23.912 --> 00:04:27.894]  So they'll just, we're going to have world government, but if you say you don't like it, I guess you're a terrorist.
[00:04:28.174 --> 00:04:30.556]  But they won't, it won't be billed as world government.
[00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.598]  It'll be billed, I mean, it's like these scams they're coming up with.
[00:04:35.043 --> 00:04:43.189]  Build as a, you know, just in case there's another Katrina or a, you know, a natural disaster or a bio-attack or whatever, it's for your own good.
[00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:46.171]  But then when you read what the Army's saying, they're admitting it's for the American people.
[00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:46.831]  Right.
[00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:50.153]  But of course it does have a dual use for emergencies, but suddenly they're building them everywhere.
[00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:53.296]  But it's built as for your safety.
[00:04:53.856 --> 00:05:00.701]  You know, it's built for, you know, if something happens, if there's a bio-attack or a hurricane, you go to the camp.
[00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:02.362]  I mean, read the bill.
[00:05:02.422 --> 00:05:07.005]  It says in the bill, it says there'll be facilities, humanitarian facilities, you know.
[00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:08.987]  And other facilities for other purposes.
[00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:09.447]  Right.
[00:05:09.647 --> 00:05:13.510]  And the local police will be there, and the local pastors that we told everybody we're secretly training with them.
[00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.293]  They'll be there, oh, it's of the Lord!
[00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:17.933]  Precisely.
[00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:22.317]  And Pat Roberts is going, nothing can stop Obama, he is of the Lord, socialism is good.
[00:05:22.817 --> 00:05:25.119]  And they're going, yes, holy, of the Lord!
[00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:26.160]  They're cranking it up.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.322]  Like you said, the next six months, they're going to try to push all this stuff through.
[00:05:30.902 --> 00:05:34.225]  And once it's there... Well, I mean, all the preparations, Kurt, and we're finally here.
[00:05:34.665 --> 00:05:38.548]  We're finally alive during the time of them defecating all over us.
[00:05:38.628 --> 00:05:39.148]  I mean, it's here.
[00:05:39.168 --> 00:05:41.250]  It's one way to put it.
[00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.834]  I'm sorry to be gross, but the New World Order hind end just popped out above us and, you know, they're going, here comes your freedom!
[00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:48.035]  Kurt, stay there.
[00:05:48.055 --> 00:05:48.455]  Okay.
[00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:49.956]  We're gonna come back in a long segment.
[00:05:50.177 --> 00:05:51.478]  By the way, I like that hat you're wearing.
[00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:56.481]  We're on the march.
[00:05:56.962 --> 00:05:58.483]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:02.236]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:05.982 --> 00:06:12.031]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the US and the world.
[00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:14.715]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the
[00:06:16.154 --> 00:06:22.358]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:06:22.638 --> 00:06:24.419]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:32.664]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:37.327]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:06:37.608 --> 00:06:43.091]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:43.731]  I think so.
[00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:11.571]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:14.915]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:17.818]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:07:17.878 --> 00:07:21.542]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:07:31.163 --> 00:07:36.022]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.871]  How dare you?
[00:07:41.312 --> 00:07:47.337]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:07:47.357 --> 00:07:50.140]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.667]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:07:56.707 --> 00:07:59.289]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[00:07:59.549 --> 00:08:01.551]  Or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:04.294]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:08:04.835 --> 00:08:10.480]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.824]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:08:16.104 --> 00:08:21.188]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:08:21.488 --> 00:08:24.991]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:25.651]  We're good to go!
[00:08:52.308 --> 00:08:54.711]  Up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[00:08:55.071 --> 00:09:01.278]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[00:09:01.538 --> 00:09:02.959]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:20.255]  Kurt Nimmo, live and in the flesh.
[00:09:21.015 --> 00:09:24.657]  His second visit to the InfoWars Command Center.
[00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:30.339]  You know, I am freaked out by all the massive attacks on the Second Amendment.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.040]  The FEMA camps are all being announced.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.523]  The slaves, meaning they're getting ready to potentially use it if they can sell the slaves on it.
[00:09:37.403 --> 00:09:38.704]  Will the people not be slaves?
[00:09:38.784 --> 00:09:39.744]  Will they say no?
[00:09:40.765 --> 00:09:43.246]  Will they fight back against it in the InfoWars?
[00:09:46.158 --> 00:09:49.619]  Kurt, what do you think of the new digs here in the new office?
[00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:50.279]  Wonderful.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.120]  Excellent.
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.220]  Still have a lot more going on.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:54.881]  We're turning the heat up.
[00:09:54.921 --> 00:09:56.541]  You see us doing interviews, bringing folks in.
[00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:58.342]  We're beefing it up right now.
[00:09:58.362 --> 00:10:00.202]  The heat's not up in here, though.
[00:10:00.942 --> 00:10:01.163]  No.
[00:10:01.543 --> 00:10:02.623]  Do you like how I keep the studio?
[00:10:02.663 --> 00:10:03.683]  I have a freezer in here.
[00:10:04.664 --> 00:10:05.624]  Well, I like it cold.
[00:10:05.844 --> 00:10:08.185]  And I used to have to boil in the other office because the A.C.
[00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:11.366]  didn't really work well in that little studio, so now it's the opposite.
[00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:13.946]  I like a haunted house in this office.
[00:10:13.966 --> 00:10:15.367]  It's hot in one room and cold in another.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.063]  Kurt, there's a lot to talk about with you.
[00:10:21.103 --> 00:10:29.049]  We've got Jordan Maxwell coming up, but of all the things going on, what's most important to you right now that's happening?
[00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:37.335]  I mean, I have a positive view, even though things are negative, because now that they're openly announcing world government, saying it's the only thing that will save you, because they are actually announcing it in a lot of publications.
[00:10:38.116 --> 00:10:39.557]  Oh, it did exist, but it's for your own good.
[00:10:40.836 --> 00:10:45.519]  I don't know if the establishment realizes how many people we warned, who then laughed at us, who are now going, whoa, you were right.
[00:10:46.339 --> 00:10:48.020]  Or maybe they do, they're just so arrogant.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:55.284]  Yeah, the most important thing for me is the economy, the engineered implosion of the economy is what's really front and center for me.
[00:10:55.304 --> 00:11:01.788]  I mean, everything else is secondary to facilitate this destruction of the American economy, the global economy.
[00:11:03.134 --> 00:11:06.076]  Yeah, that's going to be their organized, controlled crises.
[00:11:06.156 --> 00:11:08.977]  They use terror, they use wars, they use controlled implosions.
[00:11:09.297 --> 00:11:10.158]  Right, right.
[00:11:10.578 --> 00:11:21.284]  And they're trying to sell this, you know, this camp situation as, you know, like they did with Rex 84, you know, illegal aliens and whatnot, but it's for the American people, it's not for...
[00:11:22.867 --> 00:11:25.048]  An influx of Mexicans coming across the border.
[00:11:25.068 --> 00:11:26.488]  Well, again, the Army admits that.
[00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:30.770]  They're over here in the Army War College saying we're preparing to engage the American people and put them in detention centers.
[00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.051]  And all the Urban Warfare footage I've taped, they're admitting it's for America.
[00:11:34.071 --> 00:11:35.672]  They're practicing putting Americans in camps.
[00:11:36.252 --> 00:11:38.893]  They're not billing it as camps for detention, though.
[00:11:38.913 --> 00:11:43.535]  They're billing it as a humanitarian response to some kind of crisis, which will probably be the economy.
[00:11:45.947 --> 00:11:48.469]  You know, I've never played this on TV.
[00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:53.312]  I've played the audio, but now that we're at TV, guys, go to YouTube and type in Marshall Law.
[00:11:53.332 --> 00:11:57.874]  And you'll see a bunch of my videos, but you'll also see a bunch of local newscasts.
[00:11:58.255 --> 00:11:59.575]  Punch it up and I'll show you which one it is.
[00:12:01.737 --> 00:12:02.197]  Scroll down.
[00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:05.459]  Keep scrolling down.
[00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:09.562]  I'm trying to find the one.
[00:12:11.143 --> 00:12:11.523]  Here it is.
[00:12:13.137 --> 00:12:16.620]  No, no, that's a town where they have martial law 24 hours a day.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.503]  No, it doesn't matter.
[00:12:20.543 --> 00:12:21.504]  I'll find it during a break.
[00:12:21.524 --> 00:12:25.687]  The point is, I have these newscasts where locally they admit they're preparing to engage the American people.
[00:12:26.368 --> 00:12:28.870]  And there's one I particularly want to play.
[00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.132]  But again, you don't hear this on corporate news.
[00:12:32.172 --> 00:12:35.335]  You don't hear that this is for detention per se.
[00:12:38.254 --> 00:12:39.895]  Well, keep fleshing this out, Curt Nemo.
[00:12:39.935 --> 00:12:42.296]  How do you see things unfolding?
[00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:44.658]  I mean, on the good side, how could this go?
[00:12:44.678 --> 00:12:46.139]  Or on the bad side, how do you see it going?
[00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:48.800]  Well, I don't really see any difference from the Bush administration.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.482]  This is a continuous, continual thing that's going to go on.
[00:12:52.403 --> 00:12:54.364]  It's the same globalist agenda.
[00:12:54.404 --> 00:12:55.204]  It's not going to change.
[00:12:55.645 --> 00:13:02.709]  The only difference is we've got a new front guy, you know, and he's much more savvy and can read the teleprompters better.
[00:13:02.729 --> 00:13:04.430]  It's the same agenda.
[00:13:05.734 --> 00:13:06.815]  Same agenda under Clinton.
[00:13:07.416 --> 00:13:08.757]  Same agenda under Bush Senior.
[00:13:09.177 --> 00:13:12.360]  So it's just a continuation of the same agenda.
[00:13:14.922 --> 00:13:15.223]  I agree.
[00:13:15.243 --> 00:13:15.643]  Continue.
[00:13:18.024 --> 00:13:33.913]  I think that Obama is probably going to have to, you know what is really interesting is this, when you had Wayne Manson on, and he was talking about Rahm Emanuel, who's apparently the real president, cracking his knuckles in Obama's ear.
[00:13:34.633 --> 00:13:39.776]  So you take a look at this guy, and you see the real face of the global elite.
[00:13:39.936 --> 00:13:43.358]  Because he's a front man, he's a former investor, Wall Street investor.
[00:13:46.894 --> 00:14:01.826]  I think that Obama's, you know, his sheen that he has, the urbane sheen of him will start to slip away when we see these other faces appearing, and that's what Rahm Emanuel is.
[00:14:01.906 --> 00:14:03.708]  He's the real voice back there.
[00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:11.994]  Yeah, in front of the congressional delegation, getting a crack in his knuckles, and Obama says, please stop that, it bothers me.
[00:14:12.015 --> 00:14:14.777]  And he gets up in front of everybody, in front of the congressional leadership, and goes,
[00:14:17.017 --> 00:14:18.938]  Right in his ears, oh yeah, I rule you.
[00:14:19.538 --> 00:14:20.298]  I'm in control.
[00:14:20.358 --> 00:14:21.019]  He's a pit bull.
[00:14:21.939 --> 00:14:22.739]  He's a sociopath.
[00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:31.283]  Well this is the guy again in 96 when Clinton won at the victory dinner in front of everybody with a knife going, our enemies need to say their name for like five minutes and die, die, die!
[00:14:31.923 --> 00:14:33.203]  You can't make this stuff up, Kurt.
[00:14:33.524 --> 00:14:34.584]  Well look who's father was.
[00:14:34.604 --> 00:14:36.005]  His father was a terrorist in Israel.
[00:14:36.725 --> 00:14:39.126]  You know, an air gun terrorist, so.
[00:14:41.627 --> 00:14:44.048]  I guess the acorn doesn't fall too far from the tree.
[00:14:44.929 --> 00:14:51.973]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the new Chief of Staff of the White House father was one of the leaders in the Mossad and the Irgun terrorists.
[00:14:52.013 --> 00:14:52.793]  Explain what they did.
[00:14:53.394 --> 00:15:00.017]  Irgun terrorists were supposedly an Israeli defense force prior to the establishment of the State of Israel.
[00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:09.883]  Basically what they did is they attacked the British, they attacked their Arab enemies, and they engaged in terrorism, classic terrorism, blowing up hotels, killing people.
[00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:13.284]  And, uh, that's basically where his father came from.
[00:15:13.344 --> 00:15:19.268]  His father made the comment about, you know, uh, his, what was it about the Arabs cleaning the floor in the White House?
[00:15:19.328 --> 00:15:22.850]  I forget what the exact quote was, but, uh, this is the mentality.
[00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.290]  This is the mentality his son has.
[00:15:25.651 --> 00:15:31.634]  We have enemies, you know, and so we stabbed a knife in the table and it's just an attitude.
[00:15:32.274 --> 00:15:34.155]  That's the attitude that's behind Barack Obama.
[00:15:34.175 --> 00:15:34.976]  He's just the front man.
[00:15:36.118 --> 00:15:37.778]  You know, this is driving me crazy.
[00:15:38.419 --> 00:15:43.880]  There's this particular video out of Georgia with the police playing the part of Americans and the armies there putting them in a camp.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.221]  And I play the audio many times on there.
[00:15:46.241 --> 00:15:48.602]  I'm trying to find it on YouTube and can't.
[00:15:48.622 --> 00:15:52.663]  I can't remember the exact headline.
[00:15:52.683 --> 00:15:53.223]  It doesn't matter.
[00:15:53.923 --> 00:15:58.944]  What I do want to play though is, guys, because I said I'd do it, pull up some of those local activist videos.
[00:16:01.144 --> 00:16:05.907]  And put them on screen where FEMA took over one part of the old shopping mall.
[00:16:06.808 --> 00:16:11.271]  And said it was for Hurricane that was coming, but at the same time it's still there.
[00:16:11.632 --> 00:16:20.738]  And they move in for something like that, and then they admit there's going to be all these federal centers everywhere, nexusing in with the police and then with the clergy response teams.
[00:16:21.299 --> 00:16:26.923]  And then we have the newscast there where they admit the clergy response teams are training for people to stand down under martial law.
[00:16:27.683 --> 00:16:28.544]  Remember those clubs yesterday?
[00:16:28.564 --> 00:16:29.645]  We never actually played, guys?
[00:16:31.202 --> 00:16:35.224]  One was the Clergy Response Teams, Marshall Law, and the other was here in Austin.
[00:16:37.885 --> 00:16:43.087]  Okay, play the Highland Mall one, and then pull up the one you had yesterday that we didn't get to.
[00:16:43.427 --> 00:16:45.748]  So the clergy will be there to take care of people, correct?
[00:16:45.928 --> 00:16:49.090]  We've got a FEMA RV thing right over here.
[00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.511]  I don't think that's a paid vehicle.
[00:16:51.531 --> 00:16:52.491]  It's a security car.
[00:16:53.192 --> 00:16:57.553]  Yeah, but why is a FEMA RV parked in front of the mall?
[00:16:57.834 --> 00:16:58.634]  In front of the mall?
[00:16:59.714 --> 00:17:01.454]  In front of the closed part of the mall.
[00:17:02.575 --> 00:17:03.735]  That's real weird.
[00:17:03.755 --> 00:17:06.476]  Dude, look, it says Department of Homeland Security.
[00:17:06.536 --> 00:17:09.856]  It's the Department of Homeland Security parked in front of the mall?
[00:17:10.897 --> 00:17:12.717]  In front of that closed part, though.
[00:17:13.357 --> 00:17:14.837]  Okay, that's the first video.
[00:17:15.498 --> 00:17:18.818]  Go to the next video, and show me the title of these so I can plug them.
[00:17:19.098 --> 00:17:21.979]  FEMA Homeland Security Secret Ops in Highland Mall, Austin, Texas.
[00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:24.560]  Okay, now this is them talking to the police.
[00:17:27.674 --> 00:17:28.475]  I mean, it's right here, guys.
[00:17:28.495 --> 00:17:29.436]  You guys are typing it in.
[00:17:29.476 --> 00:17:31.238]  It's the video to the right of it, right there.
[00:17:32.479 --> 00:17:32.700]  See?
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.400]  Right there to the right?
[00:17:34.141 --> 00:17:35.002]  That's the video right there.
[00:17:35.643 --> 00:17:38.846]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:17:39.007 --> 00:17:41.609]  I just want to know what y'all are doing here.
[00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:42.911]  Please, tell me what's going on.
[00:17:43.091 --> 00:17:45.033]  I will be more than happy as soon as you step outside.
[00:17:45.073 --> 00:17:45.294]  Sure.
[00:17:50.431 --> 00:17:51.592]  Is there a reason you're doing that?
[00:17:51.652 --> 00:17:56.955]  We just saw the FEMA cam and I thought y'all were part of the... Is there some sort of emergency or what's going on?
[00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:58.095]  The mall had already been shut down.
[00:17:58.275 --> 00:18:00.416]  Not the mall, the store had already been shut down.
[00:18:01.237 --> 00:18:04.418]  But... Is there some reason why FEMA's here right now?
[00:18:04.478 --> 00:18:05.839]  In case Ike hits.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.780]  In case what?
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.041]  Dude, you're just a security guard.
[00:18:10.061 --> 00:18:11.502]  I'm a security guard.
[00:18:11.842 --> 00:18:13.163]  Don't say that.
[00:18:13.223 --> 00:18:17.125]  I'm sorry, we're part of an organization that is just making sure everybody under
[00:18:17.505 --> 00:18:19.546]  So what was this like a beta test for?
[00:18:41.277 --> 00:18:42.619]  I don't understand what they were doing.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.485]  They just use any excuse they can to come over and take over spaces.
[00:18:45.765 --> 00:18:48.891]  And they're putting little mini FEMA centers just all over the nation.
[00:18:48.911 --> 00:18:50.874]  They're building little FEMA camps for emergencies everywhere.
[00:18:50.894 --> 00:18:52.196]  And they have little stockades.
[00:18:52.216 --> 00:18:53.398]  You've seen my police tape films.
[00:18:53.439 --> 00:18:53.619]  Right.
[00:18:56.704 --> 00:18:59.145]  Yeah, here's the local newscast piece.
[00:19:00.326 --> 00:19:02.327]  Pastors for Martial Law, Continental Government.
[00:19:03.087 --> 00:19:06.149]  Now, the original video of this probably has a couple hundred thousand views.
[00:19:06.209 --> 00:19:06.689]  I've seen it.
[00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.431]  We're playing some new posting.
[00:19:09.471 --> 00:19:12.633]  I don't know how good the audio is on this piece.
[00:19:13.834 --> 00:19:19.038]  You always want to find one that has a higher hit view, that means it's older, so that it has a... but so what?
[00:19:19.098 --> 00:19:19.999]  Just go ahead and play it.
[00:19:20.519 --> 00:19:22.180]  Become a reality in America?
[00:19:22.581 --> 00:19:26.624]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S.
[00:19:26.664 --> 00:19:27.044]  territory.
[00:19:27.084 --> 00:19:27.404]  Hit pause.
[00:19:27.465 --> 00:19:28.125]  It cut her off.
[00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:29.406]  You've got to find the other older versions.
[00:19:29.426 --> 00:19:30.847]  It has her fully say martial law.
[00:19:30.867 --> 00:19:31.027]  See?
[00:19:31.368 --> 00:19:33.909]  That's the problem with a 50th generation video.
[00:19:35.471 --> 00:19:38.833]  Just type clergy response teams in, and then I'll control it from here.
[00:19:38.853 --> 00:19:41.936]  I just want to show people how to do this and go how to find this stuff.
[00:19:42.236 --> 00:19:43.337]  Clergy response teams, play it.
[00:19:45.371 --> 00:19:48.993]  Okay, Feds, Train, Clergy, Recons, Teams, Zequel, Dissent.
[00:19:50.113 --> 00:19:53.095]  And that's this video mixed with my videos.
[00:19:53.115 --> 00:19:55.236]  Let me find the newscast here.
[00:19:55.256 --> 00:19:59.898]  I need to look at it for hit counts.
[00:19:59.938 --> 00:20:00.958]  This doesn't make any sense.
[00:20:02.379 --> 00:20:06.901]  And of course this mouse doesn't work properly in here in my office.
[00:20:06.921 --> 00:20:09.242]  I need a new mouse or something.
[00:20:09.622 --> 00:20:10.303]  It's wireless.
[00:20:12.004 --> 00:20:12.704]  Into the other room.
[00:20:17.472 --> 00:20:20.055]  There I am on San Antonio TV talking about it.
[00:20:24.041 --> 00:20:25.122]  Clergy Response Teams.
[00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:27.926]  We'll go ahead and play this one.
[00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.212]  For folks that are out there listening, this is the audience.
[00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:34.673]  Will law ever become a reality in America?
[00:20:35.094 --> 00:20:39.397]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S.
[00:20:39.457 --> 00:20:41.519]  territory might trigger just that.
[00:20:41.979 --> 00:20:49.005]  And as KSLA News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[00:20:49.025 --> 00:20:53.268]  From my cold, dead hand, Charlton Heston.
[00:20:53.668 --> 00:20:54.329]  Did you hear that?
[00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.191]  Their biggest problem, us.
[00:20:57.231 --> 00:20:59.473]  That's what the Army says, engaging the American people.
[00:21:01.032 --> 00:21:03.274]  And they say it's of the Lord, Romans 13, we're prepared.
[00:21:03.315 --> 00:21:07.199]  And you read the actual FEMA documents, forced inoculations, gun confiscation, it's all in there.
[00:21:07.719 --> 00:21:14.267]  This famous declaration captures a truly American value, the overarching desire to protect our freedoms.
[00:21:14.947 --> 00:21:21.154]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[00:21:21.875 --> 00:21:22.175]  U.S.
[00:21:22.195 --> 00:21:23.356]  troops also arrived.
[00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:30.458]  Something far easier to do even now, thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[00:21:30.939 --> 00:21:32.039]  That forbid U.S.
[00:21:32.099 --> 00:21:34.120]  troops from policing on American soil.
[00:21:36.354 --> 00:21:43.496]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[00:21:43.976 --> 00:21:49.118]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[00:21:49.638 --> 00:21:56.140]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:02.362]  Such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus the wishes of the public.
[00:22:02.862 --> 00:22:09.504]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to diffuse that situation.
[00:22:09.524 --> 00:22:10.044]  I had him on.
[00:22:10.064 --> 00:22:17.386]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the Bible itself.
[00:22:17.826 --> 00:22:18.426]  Specifically...
[00:22:18.846 --> 00:22:19.807]  Now, what is the law?
[00:22:19.847 --> 00:22:23.272]  There's no Constitution, no Bill of Rights, you're going to a FEMA camp, we're taking your guns.
[00:22:23.392 --> 00:22:29.720]  And the Patriots are like, we helped deal with it here in Katrina.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.381]  They did it.
[00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:33.305]  And remember, this didn't exist when we broke this year and a half before this.
[00:22:33.846 --> 00:22:35.007]  We have the secret documents.
[00:22:35.568 --> 00:22:36.609]  Ten times worse than this.
[00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.630]  Well, the newscast is misleading.
[00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:43.392]  She said that the Posse Comitatus Act was been repealed or no longer in effect.
[00:22:43.412 --> 00:22:43.972]  That's not true.
[00:22:44.092 --> 00:22:45.172]  Well, they blew holes in it.
[00:22:45.192 --> 00:22:46.752]  You could drive a Death Star through it.
[00:22:46.772 --> 00:22:49.273]  But it has not officially been repealed.
[00:22:50.733 --> 00:22:53.454]  They just enacted through executive orders.
[00:22:53.534 --> 00:22:53.894]  Fiat.
[00:22:54.174 --> 00:22:54.795]  Fiat, right.
[00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:55.375]  Through Fiat.
[00:22:55.415 --> 00:22:56.175]  That's freedom.
[00:22:57.535 --> 00:22:57.915]  It's freedom.
[00:22:57.935 --> 00:23:03.197]  You know, I had that big lawyer on yesterday and he said, yes, arguing with police is a terrorist act now, punishable by 20 years in prison.
[00:23:03.237 --> 00:23:04.077]  That's in the Patriot Act.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.300]  It's just talking!
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:12.124]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[00:23:12.164 --> 00:23:15.406]  Hey, cops, you think a corrupt system like this is going to let you have your pension funds?
[00:23:16.026 --> 00:23:17.687]  This is the world you want your children living in?
[00:23:18.247 --> 00:23:20.068]  I guess I do, to find Al-Qaeda.
[00:23:22.529 --> 00:23:25.531]  Then overnight, they swing the whole apparatus against the people.
[00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:27.136]  Romans.
[00:23:27.616 --> 00:23:27.977]  Romans 13.
[00:23:28.037 --> 00:23:30.558]  Because the government's established all the law.
[00:23:31.318 --> 00:23:31.618]  You know?
[00:23:31.858 --> 00:23:33.559]  And that's what we believe in the Christian faith.
[00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:34.800]  That's what's stated in the scripture.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:44.244]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how long they expect the suspension of their rights might last.
[00:23:45.264 --> 00:23:46.905]  Jeff Ferrell, KSLA News 12 reporting.
[00:23:47.745 --> 00:23:55.149]  According to Tuberville, during Hurricane Katrina, the clergy response team provided 38 chaplains a day, around the clock, at eight different camps.
[00:23:56.255 --> 00:23:58.197]  Oh, eight different camps, Kurt.
[00:23:58.977 --> 00:23:59.898]  Once again, misleading.
[00:23:59.978 --> 00:24:04.121]  He said, depending on how long it lasts.
[00:24:04.201 --> 00:24:05.562]  Well, tyranny lasts forever.
[00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:08.104]  That's what they're saying.
[00:24:08.164 --> 00:24:11.446]  Just let us do what we want now, and then things will be okay later.
[00:24:11.466 --> 00:24:13.287]  That isn't how it works.
[00:24:13.548 --> 00:24:14.328]  It's not how it works.
[00:24:14.488 --> 00:24:15.649]  Historically, it's not how it works.
[00:24:15.689 --> 00:24:17.190]  Well, Hitler used the clergy.
[00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:17.871]  Stalin did.
[00:24:17.891 --> 00:24:18.491]  So did Mao.
[00:24:18.811 --> 00:24:19.792]  There was approved churches.
[00:24:19.812 --> 00:24:22.214]  It was just ones that weren't approved, they went after.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.241]  Romans 13 doesn't say that.
[00:24:28.541 --> 00:24:31.802]  I mean, I guess Hitler was good then, Stalin, Mao, we shouldn't have fought King George III.
[00:24:32.702 --> 00:24:36.463]  Right, well, you have to read that scripture in the context of the rest of the Bible.
[00:24:36.483 --> 00:24:42.786]  I mean, it's just, they take it out, stick it out there and say, you know, the government is of the Lord and whatever the government does is kosher.
[00:24:42.826 --> 00:24:43.666]  It's not true.
[00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:47.167]  All governments are of the Lord.
[00:24:48.908 --> 00:24:50.428]  I mean, Christ, what did he do?
[00:24:50.448 --> 00:24:54.050]  He fought against the established order in Palestine, you know?
[00:24:55.236 --> 00:24:56.697]  What did all the other disciples do?
[00:24:56.737 --> 00:24:57.618]  Most of them got killed.
[00:24:58.058 --> 00:24:58.258]  Right.
[00:24:58.538 --> 00:24:58.978]  They were crucified.
[00:24:58.998 --> 00:25:00.039]  They were in prison.
[00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:01.400]  I mean, because they did what they said.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:07.824]  I mean, can you imagine the Apostle Paul running around with the clergy response teams going, do what the Romans say.
[00:25:08.244 --> 00:25:13.147]  You know, worship whatever they... go to the FEMA camps or any of them.
[00:25:13.968 --> 00:25:14.548]  Right, right.
[00:25:14.628 --> 00:25:15.128]  Well, I mean...
[00:25:16.488 --> 00:25:20.130]  Once again, it just shows they can get away with this because people are ignorant.
[00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:21.391]  They do not know history.
[00:25:21.711 --> 00:25:23.472]  They do not even know the Bible, per se.
[00:25:23.872 --> 00:25:31.757]  They just buy this, and they look towards television to give them the news, and they believe whatever's told on television.
[00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:35.239]  There's at least 26,000 of these preachers that are under secret contract.
[00:25:35.999 --> 00:25:38.322]  To brainwash you beforehand and then after.
[00:25:38.822 --> 00:25:45.770]  And I'm telling you folks, if your preacher's going, Romans 13 of the Lord, firearms are not good, go to emergency centers when it's needed.
[00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.034]  We've got all these TV preachers saying it after this happened.
[00:25:49.074 --> 00:25:50.055]  They're reading a script.
[00:25:50.756 --> 00:25:53.519]  In fact, people have done videos of preacher after preacher saying the same thing.
[00:25:54.537 --> 00:25:55.837]  That crisis is coming.
[00:25:56.117 --> 00:25:57.378]  Do what the government says.
[00:25:57.958 --> 00:26:00.058]  You may have to go to emergency centers.
[00:26:00.078 --> 00:26:02.039]  I mean, how creepy is this, Kurt?
[00:26:02.059 --> 00:26:06.760]  This is like a nightmare science fiction novel about some dystopia takeover of America.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.240]  It's George Orwell in slow motion.
[00:26:09.941 --> 00:26:11.841]  Leading up to total tyranny.
[00:26:14.322 --> 00:26:20.243]  Kurt, why don't you just support Homeland Security and let the foreign bankers take over and turn your guns in, Kurt?
[00:26:21.594 --> 00:26:23.855]  I mean, come on, the government wants to help you.
[00:26:23.875 --> 00:26:25.215]  They're not run by made-offs.
[00:26:26.256 --> 00:26:29.457]  They're run by good people that want to help you.
[00:26:30.337 --> 00:26:30.737]  Right.
[00:26:30.877 --> 00:26:31.597]  It's of the Lord.
[00:26:31.637 --> 00:26:32.898]  That's what the scripture teaches.
[00:26:34.378 --> 00:26:36.239]  Why don't you repent and worship government?
[00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:39.480]  Kneel down right now before Obama.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.481]  Messiah Obama.
[00:26:41.701 --> 00:26:42.481]  It's of the Lord.
[00:26:45.239 --> 00:26:47.502]  Kurt, we're worried about your soul right now.
[00:26:47.562 --> 00:26:49.284]  It's unbelievable that people buy this.
[00:26:49.504 --> 00:26:51.826]  Kurt, you need to turn your children over to the government.
[00:26:52.868 --> 00:26:56.692]  In the FEMA training manuals, the preachers are there to go, ma'am, let them take your child.
[00:26:56.752 --> 00:27:02.378]  Now, ma'am, the Lord says, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord.
[00:27:05.248 --> 00:27:06.749]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.391]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:27:08.691 --> 00:27:10.933]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:27:11.373 --> 00:27:16.117]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:27:16.517 --> 00:27:19.360]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:11.476]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:13.519]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:28:14.491 --> 00:28:15.492]  But who is the enemy?
[00:28:16.032 --> 00:28:16.513]  Bin Laden.
[00:28:16.833 --> 00:28:17.814]  This is his MO.
[00:28:17.834 --> 00:28:19.175]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:28:19.195 --> 00:28:20.817]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:28:21.197 --> 00:28:27.943]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:28:28.343 --> 00:28:28.784]  Some U.S.
[00:28:28.824 --> 00:28:34.509]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:38.652]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:28:38.672 --> 00:28:41.654]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.230]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:12.512]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:12.712 --> 00:29:14.032]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:14.312 --> 00:29:22.474]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:28.435]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:28.615 --> 00:29:30.397]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:30.437 --> 00:29:32.619]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:32.639 --> 00:29:36.982]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:37.162 --> 00:29:39.284]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:29:39.384 --> 00:29:46.931]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:29:47.011 --> 00:29:48.052]  We're good to go.
[00:30:12.293 --> 00:30:15.655]  By the way, I am going to not be doing the radio show tomorrow.
[00:30:15.775 --> 00:30:16.695]  Bob Dacey will be here.
[00:30:16.735 --> 00:30:19.217]  We've got Max Keiser and some other big guests on with him.
[00:30:19.797 --> 00:30:20.717]  And Kurt Nimmo.
[00:30:21.338 --> 00:30:24.039]  While he's here in town, he'll have a good discussion.
[00:30:24.079 --> 00:30:28.922]  Fourth hour, he'll be in the studio on prisonplanet.tv with Bob Dacey.
[00:30:29.302 --> 00:30:32.244]  Remember, Jim Jones said, drink the Kool-Aid with the arsenic.
[00:30:32.444 --> 00:30:34.645]  He was the government in that little community.
[00:30:35.085 --> 00:30:36.326]  And he said, it's of the Lord.
[00:30:38.007 --> 00:30:42.509]  I mean, I just can't get over them going, it's of the Lord to go to the FEMA camp, Kurt.
[00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:45.490]  These people don't know what the Lord is.
[00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.110]  It's amazing.
[00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.431]  It really is amazing.
[00:30:49.871 --> 00:30:53.392]  The depth of brainwashing on a societal level.
[00:30:54.733 --> 00:30:58.374]  Kurt, I want to go to some phone calls from Neil, Maggie, Paul, Ronnie, Wilson, and others.
[00:30:58.434 --> 00:31:00.054]  But anything else you want to add before we go to those calls?
[00:31:00.195 --> 00:31:00.955]  Let's go to the calls.
[00:31:01.135 --> 00:31:02.935]  Let's go to Neil in South Dakota.
[00:31:03.436 --> 00:31:06.377]  Neil, you need to worship all governments, including Ahmed Dinejid.
[00:31:06.417 --> 00:31:07.357]  It's of the Lord.
[00:31:10.026 --> 00:31:10.246]  Hello.
[00:31:10.646 --> 00:31:11.207]  Hello, Neil.
[00:31:11.947 --> 00:31:12.648]  Hey, how are you?
[00:31:12.668 --> 00:31:16.471]  I've got a question about the gun control stuff you were talking about earlier.
[00:31:16.571 --> 00:31:17.091]  Yes, sir.
[00:31:18.112 --> 00:31:19.633]  The victim disarmament, yes.
[00:31:20.133 --> 00:31:20.854]  Yes, exactly.
[00:31:22.135 --> 00:31:36.565]  You had mentioned that they're not getting my semi-auto, I'm not going to go for fingerprinting, etc., and as I recall, I apologize, I'm a little bit nervous here, you mentioned that they're not going to get the stuff from you, but as I recall, you've got some young kids, so
[00:31:37.245 --> 00:31:44.330]  How do you reconcile the fact that you've got to take care of your kids and yet, you know, make a shot or take them to a camp trying to resist?
[00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:48.313]  Well, this isn't just Australia where they disarm people so they can start stealing their land.
[00:31:48.353 --> 00:31:51.295]  They killed the real Crocodile Dundee like ten years ago.
[00:31:51.335 --> 00:31:52.436]  He wouldn't turn his guns in.
[00:31:52.816 --> 00:31:54.037]  This is a hardcore tyranny.
[00:31:54.077 --> 00:31:56.919]  So if they get the guns, they're taking you to the camp anyways.
[00:31:57.619 --> 00:32:00.141]  And so I'm always someone who's calling against violence.
[00:32:00.701 --> 00:32:04.344]  It's not a radical statement, though, to say that they're taking people to camps and forcibly taking them.
[00:32:04.604 --> 00:32:05.265]  That's tyranny.
[00:32:06.085 --> 00:32:10.192]  And it's the natural law that this is the illegitimate government run by foreign bankers.
[00:32:10.793 --> 00:32:14.218]  And all I'm saying, and we as a people need to say, no, you're criminal.
[00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:19.706]  No, you know, if they do pass these illegal laws, we need to turn out, protest, call Congress and
[00:32:21.109 --> 00:32:38.587]  Can you imagine when they do it, everybody lining up, turning them in, the images of that on the news, there's going to be shootouts, they're going to make examples of people, kill people in their houses, and go, well, it's the law, SWAT team guys on the news going, good job, red leader, you did a great job, just watch me shoot him ten times, I'm such a man!
[00:32:38.607 --> 00:32:39.968]  I mean, that's where it's going.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.443]  If they succeed, the country's dead.
[00:32:44.003 --> 00:32:48.391]  The guns are the final insurance policy and they're coming for them.
[00:32:48.571 --> 00:32:51.115]  But let's stop the legislation now, Kurt.
[00:32:52.148 --> 00:32:54.249]  Well, what is there, 86 million guns in this country?
[00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.352]  Oh no, there's 150 million gun owners on average owning two guns.
[00:32:57.852 --> 00:33:00.574]  So there's more than 300 million guns and that's what's known.
[00:33:00.594 --> 00:33:01.714]  That's what the government says there is.
[00:33:02.295 --> 00:33:09.800]  So this whole plan will have to depend on people actually willingly turning in their guns.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:10.841]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:33:11.201 --> 00:33:12.241]  The bills are all introduced.
[00:33:12.982 --> 00:33:21.368]  To ban all semi-autos, to make you go get a federal register, federal license, making a right of privilege, licenses to do something that would be illegal.
[00:33:22.498 --> 00:33:33.916]  uh... and uh... they're doing it and and and uh... it's happening and psychological testing and everything else i mean remember uh... during the debates for the vice presidents
[00:33:35.191 --> 00:33:42.514]  Biden, the guy on the YouTube, who was a YouTube reporter for CNN, you know, they've got citizen reporters, said, here's my AR-15, this is my baby, you're not going to take it, are you?
[00:33:42.934 --> 00:33:45.995]  And he said, yes, I'm going to take that gun.
[00:33:46.055 --> 00:33:47.956]  You're mentally ill for wanting to have that.
[00:33:48.216 --> 00:33:52.138]  See, it's mentally ill to them, but it's not to see a slave with a gun, because that's not a slave.
[00:33:52.378 --> 00:33:53.178]  It's very upsetting.
[00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:56.780]  They're all like, oh man, God, I can't wait to disarm that wild human.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.521]  I can't wait to have him under my control.
[00:33:58.541 --> 00:34:01.942]  And he's just like, yes, you're mentally ill and you wouldn't be able to own a gun.
[00:34:02.182 --> 00:34:03.103]  Well, that's part of the process.
[00:34:03.123 --> 00:34:04.404]  Wanting a gun is mentally ill.
[00:34:04.444 --> 00:34:05.144]  It's in the bill!
[00:34:05.285 --> 00:34:05.945]  Right, right.
[00:34:06.265 --> 00:34:07.386]  And that's part of the process.
[00:34:07.606 --> 00:34:08.227]  H.R.
[00:34:08.247 --> 00:34:08.227]  45.
[00:34:09.228 --> 00:34:12.510]  Is brainwashing people into thinking that owning a firearm is mental illness.
[00:34:13.191 --> 00:34:13.591]  Hey, Alex.
[00:34:14.032 --> 00:34:14.252]  Yes, sir.
[00:34:14.272 --> 00:34:18.355]  I can jump in real quick here and just make sure I stated my question properly.
[00:34:18.855 --> 00:34:31.586]  As someone, you know, as a father who has young children, say, you know, personalizing it in your case, how do you reconcile the fact that you've got to take care of your kids, and yet they're coming to take away your guns and stuff like that, and you want to protect your kids, yet you can't really give up your guns?
[00:34:32.668 --> 00:34:33.709]  Look, it's real simple.
[00:34:34.009 --> 00:34:36.291]  These bastards want our guns to make us slaves.
[00:34:36.691 --> 00:34:39.593]  I'm going to protect my family, and I'm not giving them my guns.
[00:34:40.094 --> 00:34:43.016]  Like they say, come and take it in Gonzales, Texas.
[00:34:43.977 --> 00:34:51.342]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:34:51.382 --> 00:34:52.543]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:34:55.182 --> 00:34:56.744]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:34:56.864 --> 00:35:01.431]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:35:01.611 --> 00:35:04.355]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:35:04.575 --> 00:35:07.419]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:35:07.619 --> 00:35:12.346]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:35:12.546 --> 00:35:13.487]  If you simply prepare.
[00:35:13.687 --> 00:35:16.610]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:23.816]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[00:35:43.714 --> 00:35:44.315]  Take action today.
[00:35:44.355 --> 00:35:46.137]  The first step is getting scorable food.
[00:35:57.856 --> 00:35:59.757]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:36:00.238 --> 00:36:03.159]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36:06.822 --> 00:36:18.669]  You know, I'm very sad all these things are happening, but in a way, we know the battle needs to be joined.
[00:36:19.529 --> 00:36:21.671]  This country's been rotting slowly for a long time.
[00:36:22.151 --> 00:36:23.252]  They gotta be making their move.
[00:36:24.474 --> 00:36:31.562]  What did General Chesty Puller say when they were surrounded in North Korea by like 15 times their number?
[00:36:31.582 --> 00:36:33.565]  I said, sir, we're completely surrounded.
[00:36:33.605 --> 00:36:35.487]  He said, well, that makes our situation a lot easier.
[00:36:36.749 --> 00:36:38.110]  Makes our logistics a lot better.
[00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:39.111]  Don't let any of them escape.
[00:36:41.354 --> 00:36:44.277]  But we do outnumber the New World Order millions to one.
[00:36:46.132 --> 00:36:48.253]  And again, a lot of police and military don't like what's happening.
[00:36:48.273 --> 00:36:56.616]  They need to draw the line in the sand mentally and ask themselves, FEMA camps, foreign troops, gun confiscation, is this what you want to sign your soul, your one life onto?
[00:36:58.297 --> 00:36:59.638]  Do you stand with the Republic?
[00:37:04.319 --> 00:37:07.041]  They need to get out of their lethargy and start investigating.
[00:37:07.061 --> 00:37:09.001]  They need to learn the truth.
[00:37:09.662 --> 00:37:11.723]  Unfortunately, a lot of people are intellectually lazy.
[00:37:11.743 --> 00:37:15.164]  They just go to CNN and Fox News and buy whatever they tell them.
[00:37:16.383 --> 00:37:17.824]  That's one of the major problems.
[00:37:18.825 --> 00:37:24.409]  Speaking of buying, we're really trying to build up capital here to expand to do more during this maximum time.
[00:37:24.689 --> 00:37:25.910]  It's all about the information.
[00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:31.314]  It's all about funds to get better servers, make more videos, hire more staff, make the websites better, more writers.
[00:37:32.165 --> 00:37:33.065]  We just got these in.
[00:37:33.085 --> 00:37:35.606]  I noticed there was a pile of them on the desk and Kurt got one for himself.
[00:37:35.926 --> 00:37:37.967]  Kurt, tell us about the Attorney Response Team hat.
[00:37:38.608 --> 00:37:39.848]  Nice hat.
[00:37:39.888 --> 00:37:40.468]  High quality?
[00:37:40.628 --> 00:37:41.569]  That's a handsome hat.
[00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:43.129]  It says Infowars.com on the back.
[00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.890]  Right.
[00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:45.470]  Look at that sucker.
[00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:48.711]  That is one handsome hat, Kurt.
[00:37:50.892 --> 00:37:53.033]  There's a banner hat on Infowars.com.
[00:37:53.053 --> 00:37:54.334]  Just click it and you'll go to the ad.
[00:37:54.354 --> 00:37:55.914]  You've had the ladies chasing you around wearing that.
[00:37:55.954 --> 00:37:56.555]  I sure did.
[00:38:00.681 --> 00:38:02.282]  Oh man, I can't believe it's all real.
[00:38:02.342 --> 00:38:08.765]  I mean, I knew intellectually it was all real, but to just see them in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times going, world government's good, it's going to save you.
[00:38:09.805 --> 00:38:10.925]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:38:14.347 --> 00:38:18.669]  Yes, I was looking at myself on the monitor over there.
[00:38:19.169 --> 00:38:20.470]  I was admiring myself.
[00:38:22.148 --> 00:38:23.008]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:38:23.228 --> 00:38:31.251]  And if you look at the stimulus bill and the way they've been selling its so-called stimulus bill, you know, corporate media is really slick.
[00:38:31.331 --> 00:38:34.072]  They're really pushing it as, you know, it's going to help us.
[00:38:34.092 --> 00:38:37.714]  It's going to help us when it's actually just going to increase the national debt astronomically.
[00:38:38.334 --> 00:38:42.876]  And facilitate the banker collapse even more, and far sooner.
[00:38:43.716 --> 00:38:46.698]  Well, the last caller made a great point that I haven't even mentioned about the victim disarmament.
[00:38:47.318 --> 00:38:53.901]  Chicago, New York, places where they have total gun bans, have two, three, four, five times the national average, depending on which year it is, it changes.
[00:38:54.141 --> 00:38:55.882]  But it's always, I mean, it's a hellhole!
[00:38:56.422 --> 00:38:59.984]  And the cops openly are shaking everybody down, it's admittedly mafia.
[00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:02.765]  I mean, why would mafia run cities want your guns?
[00:39:03.615 --> 00:39:05.977]  Well, obviously, so that you can't resist them.
[00:39:05.997 --> 00:39:07.298]  But I'll tell you what, I live in Chicago.
[00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:09.700]  A lot of people have guns in the inner city.
[00:39:10.041 --> 00:39:11.402]  They're illegal, but they have guns.
[00:39:11.542 --> 00:39:14.264]  And that's why they want the National Guard to do door-to-door gun checks.
[00:39:16.607 --> 00:39:18.248]  Total constitutional violation.
[00:39:18.348 --> 00:39:18.708]  Totally.
[00:39:19.329 --> 00:39:19.990]  On numerous levels.
[00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:21.751]  Well, they just can't wait.
[00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:23.553]  They want to target the good people of America.
[00:39:24.209 --> 00:39:48.746]  and uh... they were i mean they were doing it but they're probably over all ranchers got a handgun you know in the glove compartment jail right here in texas will say was an officer choose to say i don't like that and they get get the old i think it's cowboy hat off get the old man and it's been on the news and take him to jail the judge goes you're going to jail more is that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
[00:39:49.875 --> 00:39:51.596]  They love their security, their guns.
[00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:55.837]  Notice how the government also is building up armaments against us while going after our guns.
[00:39:55.877 --> 00:39:59.958]  But the good news is, Kurt, 44% increase, broken all-time record.
[00:40:00.178 --> 00:40:00.398]  Right.
[00:40:00.738 --> 00:40:01.398]  And that's classic.
[00:40:01.458 --> 00:40:07.040]  I mean, look at Germany before Hitler's dictatorship or during his ascent after the Enabling Act.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.260]  That's precisely what they did.
[00:40:08.821 --> 00:40:10.001]  First they registered the guns.
[00:40:10.041 --> 00:40:11.281]  They made you register your gun.
[00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:14.942]  They made you go to a hunting club and put your guns in their facility.
[00:40:15.303 --> 00:40:16.583]  And then they just confiscated them.
[00:40:16.943 --> 00:40:19.425]  That's precisely what's unrolling now, here in the United States.
[00:40:19.745 --> 00:40:22.607]  Yup, and then they started having, but then everything was okay.
[00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:24.188]  Of course everything was okay.
[00:40:24.208 --> 00:40:26.409]  The government was nice after that.
[00:40:26.429 --> 00:40:29.972]  As long as you didn't oppose the government.
[00:40:29.992 --> 00:40:32.514]  When a government wants your guns, folks, they're planning bad stuff.
[00:40:32.534 --> 00:40:33.154]  That's right.
[00:40:34.508 --> 00:40:35.089]  It's real simple.
[00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:36.430]  I mean, I got a family.
[00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:37.511]  I'm on the radio.
[00:40:37.531 --> 00:40:42.117]  You think I want to be on air saying, lock and load, you know, this is it, this is the republic?
[00:40:42.717 --> 00:40:45.180]  Every day I've got to make the decision to commit fully to this.
[00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:50.266]  There's so many people, and you've pointed this out constantly, out there who believe that guns are evil.
[00:40:52.272 --> 00:40:54.634]  Well, they are evil in the hands of evil government.
[00:40:54.934 --> 00:40:55.135]  Right.
[00:40:55.175 --> 00:40:58.458]  But I'm saying the mere presence of this piece of hardware is evil.
[00:40:58.698 --> 00:40:58.878]  Yeah.
[00:40:59.098 --> 00:41:00.560]  He's the writer at InfoWars.com.
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.201]  We'll be back in tomorrow live.
[00:41:02.522 --> 00:41:03.963]  In studio, he is Kurt Nemo.
[00:41:04.063 --> 00:41:04.964]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:41:06.425 --> 00:41:07.606]  Hi, this is Steve Shank.
[00:41:07.927 --> 00:41:09.088]  eFoods does it again.
[00:41:09.188 --> 00:41:14.072]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[00:41:14.433 --> 00:41:15.534]  The price of the 3-Day Responder
[00:41:18.979 --> 00:41:22.540]  $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[00:41:23.061 --> 00:41:30.705]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you'll understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[00:41:31.105 --> 00:41:37.668]  Whether you're hunting, playing or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-Day Responder is easy to fix and ready to go.
[00:41:38.169 --> 00:41:39.610]  Food is an everyday need.
[00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:44.092]  The 3-Day Responder is for the time when food should be the last thing
[00:41:46.374 --> 00:41:51.137]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:41:51.177 --> 00:41:53.298]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:42:14.642 --> 00:42:15.663]  But who is the enemy?
[00:42:16.184 --> 00:42:16.684]  Bin Laden.
[00:42:17.005 --> 00:42:17.966]  This is his M.O.
[00:42:17.986 --> 00:42:19.288]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:42:19.368 --> 00:42:20.990]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:28.118]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:42:28.518 --> 00:42:28.959]  Some U.S.
[00:42:28.999 --> 00:42:34.666]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:42:35.326 --> 00:42:38.847]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:42:39.208 --> 00:42:49.071]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:42:49.311 --> 00:42:50.052]  Fabled Enemies.

[00:43:05.512 --> 00:43:08.897]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:43:09.037 --> 00:43:14.264]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:43:14.444 --> 00:43:19.150]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:43:20.452 --> 00:43:30.757]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:43:31.117 --> 00:43:36.660]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:42.943]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.410]  Engage!
[00:44:22.851 --> 00:44:26.053]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:44:29.296 --> 00:44:33.639]  Well, in the next 51 and a half minutes, we're joined by the legendary Jordan Maxwell.
[00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:39.673]  Esoteric researcher, master at decoding a New World Order.
[00:44:39.713 --> 00:44:43.095]  We're going to get Jordan on in these interesting times.
[00:44:43.155 --> 00:44:46.976]  Total semi-automatic gun ban bills introduced, racing through Congress.
[00:44:46.996 --> 00:44:50.177]  Total registration, psychological testing to own guns.
[00:44:50.237 --> 00:44:54.278]  The Attorney General will be able to ban any guns he wishes by a simple stroke of the pen.
[00:44:54.398 --> 00:44:57.399]  So executive tyrannical power being transferred.
[00:44:57.459 --> 00:45:00.300]  Global bankers engineering the collapse by design.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.521]  Hundreds of mainstream publications announcing the world government
[00:45:04.381 --> 00:45:33.320]  is upon us and it's a good thing like the Wall Street Journal market watch yesterday with the headline North American Union currency uniting US, Canada, Mexico money could result from crisis and they say yes it's true but it will save you and save the economy so this is classic problem reaction solution create the economic crisis then say total tyranny is the solution and paying our taxes carbon taxes on all human activity to the new super private central bank they're openly setting up in Bretton Woods too.
[00:45:34.361 --> 00:45:37.282]  So, joining us, ladies and gentlemen, is Jordan Maxwell.
[00:45:37.302 --> 00:45:38.422]  Jordan, good to have you here with us.
[00:45:39.022 --> 00:45:41.262]  Well, I'm glad to be with you again, Alex.
[00:45:41.883 --> 00:45:44.083]  I don't know what we could add to what you just said.
[00:45:44.103 --> 00:45:45.683]  I mean, that pretty well says it all.
[00:45:45.703 --> 00:45:57.726]  I mean, my God, it's just incredible watching what's going on right in front of our eyes, right in front of our faces, and nothing seems to bother the American public.
[00:45:57.766 --> 00:45:58.846]  They just keep watching.
[00:46:00.009 --> 00:46:04.253]  And it just keeps getting darker and darker down the tunnel, and I'm just amazed.
[00:46:05.193 --> 00:46:06.455]  I don't have any words for it.
[00:46:07.475 --> 00:46:12.660]  But there is something else bigger, even bigger than all of that going on.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:27.112]  This thing that's happening to America is very, very ancient, very old, and I've been looking at this thing for a long time, and it's really, really scary, because the implications are it's not just going to
[00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:34.194]  Destroy the individuality of the people of America and enslave the Americans.
[00:46:34.474 --> 00:46:42.158]  This is a worldwide phenomenon, and it's been going on for a long time, and I've been doing a lot of work on that over the years.
[00:46:43.388 --> 00:46:45.110]  I'm just amazed.
[00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:46.391]  I don't know where to start.
[00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:50.975]  I started in 59, so that's right around 48 years now I've been looking and talking about this subject.
[00:47:01.667 --> 00:47:17.501]  So, getting close to 50 years here, dealing with this, everything you said, everything you laid out, how they would do it, the steps they would go in, you were right, others were right, covering different slices of the agenda, G. Edward Griffin,
[00:47:18.862 --> 00:47:24.847]  Gary Allen, people like that, and now you've been proven right, vindicated in spades.
[00:47:26.328 --> 00:47:32.973]  Now tell us what it's like to see it all admitted, and what that means that the globalists are now emerging.
[00:47:33.033 --> 00:47:34.194]  You always said that was key.
[00:47:34.415 --> 00:47:43.002]  The uncloaking was when they would put the capstone on, and then, so what does it mean that they're now announcing it all, after denying it, and then where are we going?
[00:47:43.742 --> 00:47:44.282]  Oh, I'll tell you.
[00:47:44.763 --> 00:47:48.645]  Alex, like you said, I've been working on this for many, many years.
[00:47:49.325 --> 00:47:59.191]  Back in 1967, I stumbled upon a piece of the puzzle that, at the time, I knew was going to be very important.
[00:47:59.311 --> 00:48:01.292]  I just didn't know why or how.
[00:48:02.233 --> 00:48:10.717]  And since 1967, I've been looking at that one piece, along with everything else, but especially that piece of the puzzle that I discovered in 67.
[00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:15.693]  Been paramount in my thinking and in my research.
[00:48:16.353 --> 00:48:30.063]  And only until the coming of the new president did that, what is it, 40 some odd years of research in 1967 finally come into full view.
[00:48:31.404 --> 00:48:34.286]  It's a story that you would not believe.
[00:48:34.306 --> 00:48:41.151]  And I'm just amazed that all the things that I've been researching on that one subject
[00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:44.334]  It's now in your face everywhere.
[00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:55.103]  I was talking about it many years ago, and another reason I'm not getting into that one symbol and one subject is because it's so big.
[00:48:55.283 --> 00:49:11.476]  It's such a huge subject, but the same symbolism, the words and terms that were used by the Egyptians, used in the ancient Middle East, used in ancient Greece, and in Rome, and then finally into Europe and Britannia.
[00:49:12.023 --> 00:49:13.625]  And finally, into America.
[00:49:13.685 --> 00:49:28.404]  You can trace these words, terms, and symbols all the way back into ancient history, and the implication is that we are facing something which is so awesome, and so old, and so well established.
[00:49:29.451 --> 00:49:50.827]  That this is why we are not able to do anything because people, generally speaking, do not know the perimeters of how old and vast and monumental this apparatus is, unless until you understand how far back this thing goes and what these symbols mean.
[00:49:51.907 --> 00:49:58.372]  Like I said, I've got like over 40 years looking at this one symbol that is just driving me crazy because
[00:49:59.602 --> 00:50:05.829]  Obama's government is filled with this kind of occult symbolism.
[00:50:05.849 --> 00:50:07.291]  The rising sun?
[00:50:07.711 --> 00:50:08.192]  You've got it.
[00:50:08.212 --> 00:50:09.413]  That's exactly right.
[00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:11.255]  Now, let's stop there.
[00:50:12.717 --> 00:50:15.900]  We saw Obama coming, but I didn't realize that in America
[00:50:16.761 --> 00:50:34.369]  Even the Washington Post admits that he's using Hitlerian and Maoist and Stalinist colorations, posters, slogans, and now they create the crisis with Bush, get everybody scared, and then make all the hate of Bush about loving Obama, transferring all that energy into their agenda.
[00:50:35.029 --> 00:50:40.550]  And now it's all just going at light speed, and they're calling him President of the World, Messiah.
[00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:47.131]  Is he a prototype of their world leader, or could Obama be their messianic leader?
[00:50:47.591 --> 00:50:52.212]  Well, I'll tell you, everything you just said is absolutely correctly understood.
[00:50:52.232 --> 00:50:53.252]  You're exactly right.
[00:50:53.873 --> 00:51:01.654]  That the words and terms, and you said it so much better than I could, that the terms, the symbols, the words,
[00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:18.137]  The catchphrases are taken directly out of the Soviet school of philosophy, taken directly out of the communist philosophy, taken directly out of Adolf Hitler's philosophies and words and terms that we use by the Nazis.
[00:51:18.897 --> 00:51:22.559]  And once you see this, it's just overwhelming to me.
[00:51:22.699 --> 00:51:24.660]  It's just... It's staggering.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.020]  I feel far-strung.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.641]  It's staggering how in your face it is.
[00:51:28.741 --> 00:51:30.022]  It's right there in your face.
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:43.364]  But the people have never spent time looking at this kind of an arcane subject of how world leaders use occult terms and symbols to manipulate the human masses.
[00:51:43.544 --> 00:51:47.385]  And so, again, I don't see it as a problem for America.
[00:51:48.126 --> 00:51:51.166]  Now, I see it as a problem for the human race.
[00:51:51.306 --> 00:51:59.209]  The entire human species on Earth is now in serious trouble because the entire Earth is now covered
[00:52:00.411 --> 00:52:07.094]  Uh, with these symbols, words, and terms, and today, uh, around the world, nobody seems to recognize it.
[00:52:07.154 --> 00:52:08.135]  Nobody seems to know.
[00:52:08.295 --> 00:52:08.575]  Why?
[00:52:08.955 --> 00:52:10.736]  Because no one studied the subject.
[00:52:11.596 --> 00:52:13.077]  It's just, uh, appalling to me.
[00:52:13.257 --> 00:52:15.758]  Now, now, let me just ask you.
[00:52:17.588 --> 00:52:23.951]  The global architects, the Babylon Mystery Schools, they believe in a coming world messiah.
[00:52:24.651 --> 00:52:29.553]  And in the prototypes that they've had from India and the Middle East, it is generally a brown-skinned man.
[00:52:29.573 --> 00:52:33.635]  And I couldn't believe it when I saw Obama coming that he could be the one.
[00:52:34.295 --> 00:52:40.378]  And I'm not even getting into a Christian issue here, because the elites have their own messiah complex, as you know well, Jordan, but for the audience.
[00:52:41.178 --> 00:52:44.822]  Is he a prototype to their coming world messiah?
[00:52:45.022 --> 00:52:50.186]  Or do you think the elite are actually trying, currently, to make him be the one?
[00:52:51.227 --> 00:52:52.228]  Well, I'm not sure.
[00:52:52.549 --> 00:53:01.036]  But, you know, on the one hand, I have to say about Obama and his family, I like his presence.
[00:53:01.357 --> 00:53:02.938]  His presence is very likable.
[00:53:03.439 --> 00:53:05.360]  His family is very charming.
[00:53:06.474 --> 00:53:36.006]  And the girls are absolutely charming, and I don't have anything against Obama and his family, but I'm just saying that if you know the symbols, if you've studied them over the years, the words, the terms, the catchphrases, the little small emblems that are words and the terms that are used, and begin to study how these symbols are used, what the words mean, once you have got that down,
[00:53:36.784 --> 00:53:42.126]  Then you begin looking at American politics and American presidential politics.
[00:53:42.326 --> 00:53:43.947]  It's alarming.
[00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:45.607]  It's just staggering.
[00:53:46.008 --> 00:54:02.954]  These are the same terms that Adolf Hitler used, but especially now, the Soviet terms and symbols that were... I was talking many years ago, giving lectures back in 1967 on Soviet philosophy, symbolism,
[00:54:03.542 --> 00:54:03.943]  What do you think?
[00:54:12.782 --> 00:54:16.703]  That I grew up with since 1967, looking at those terms.
[00:54:16.983 --> 00:54:18.144]  What about the charms?
[00:54:18.164 --> 00:54:19.004]  What about the charms?
[00:54:19.024 --> 00:54:20.385]  He carries different days.
[00:54:20.405 --> 00:54:25.806]  A little Norse gods, a little monkey gods from the Hindus.
[00:54:26.186 --> 00:54:27.947]  He always has these charms with him.
[00:54:27.967 --> 00:54:29.428]  What's that about?
[00:54:30.108 --> 00:54:39.911]  Well, I know that's just on the face of it that's frightening and scary, because I already know, like I said, not just America, but the entire Earth.
[00:54:40.524 --> 00:54:40.584]  Is
[00:55:01.599 --> 00:55:05.060]  What the whole entire agenda really is.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.781]  And notice he came right as the crisis was peaking.
[00:55:09.041 --> 00:55:11.542]  They engineered it perfectly as he comes in.
[00:55:11.862 --> 00:55:13.122]  He's now got the agenda.
[00:55:13.162 --> 00:55:13.803]  He'll save you.
[00:55:14.483 --> 00:55:14.943]  You got it.
[00:55:15.503 --> 00:55:19.244]  And it's just amazing to me how much people don't know.
[00:55:19.504 --> 00:55:21.805]  They've just no one has taken the time.
[00:55:22.643 --> 00:55:40.662]  uh... to look at these symbols and and were let me ask you this and we're going to come back from break and go through it the monkey charm in in uh... hindu religion what what does that symbolize well if it goes all uh... you know uh... like i said that's just a huge subject on ancient religion and we can talk about that later
[00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:45.505]  Okay, well, let's come back and continue with the world agenda.
[00:55:45.625 --> 00:55:58.410]  Why are they openly announcing world government, world taxation, world regulation, and saying we've got to get behind Obama, and then Henry Kissinger saying Obama will bring in the new world order on CNBC.
[00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:01.491]  Obama will bring in the new age.
[00:56:02.031 --> 00:56:03.291]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:03.311 --> 00:56:04.692]  Jordan Maxwell is our guest.

[00:57:05.207 --> 00:57:12.189]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero and we knew what to do.
[00:57:12.209 --> 00:57:14.010]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:20.672]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:57:21.252 --> 00:57:27.994]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[00:57:28.697 --> 00:57:29.838]  We're safe to breathe.
[00:57:30.158 --> 00:57:36.961]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:57:37.261 --> 00:57:40.322]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:57:40.442 --> 00:57:45.665]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:57:46.205 --> 00:57:48.886]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:58:33.431 --> 00:58:37.393]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.

[01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:28.338]  You can Google, no shackles on me.
[01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:28.858]  Jimmy Vaughn.
[01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.856]  Jordan, before we go any further, fire out your website for folks.
[01:00:35.876 --> 01:00:39.117]  We're going to post it on PrisonPlanet.tv right now as well.
[01:00:39.517 --> 01:00:41.577]  We're live on PrisonPlanet.tv, not just on the radio.
[01:00:42.578 --> 01:00:44.598]  There's several sites out there, but what's your main site?
[01:00:45.578 --> 01:00:47.279]  JordanMaxwell.com.
[01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:48.319]  Try and keep it simple.
[01:00:48.419 --> 01:00:50.639]  Just JordanMaxwell.com.
[01:00:51.139 --> 01:00:53.380]  And I hope we don't crash your servers today like last time.
[01:00:53.888 --> 01:00:54.528]  Well, I know.
[01:00:54.548 --> 01:01:03.594]  You know, last time we were talking about a possible project that the two of us might do.
[01:01:04.174 --> 01:01:12.619]  I would like to do an hour and a half minimum of a 90 minute presentation, put it on film, and do it right.
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:20.624]  Because I've never been able to do any of my work with the good technological stuff that's available today.
[01:01:20.724 --> 01:01:21.185]  I don't have.
[01:01:22.498 --> 01:01:36.825]  I would like to do something on this one symbol that I was telling you about, because I am totally convinced that if the people were to see what I'm talking about, it's very difficult to impress anyone just talking about something.
[01:01:36.865 --> 01:01:37.825]  You'd have to see it.
[01:01:38.605 --> 01:01:48.250]  But if I could do something with this subject that I've been working on since 67, like I said, for 40 years I've been looking at one symbol and one
[01:01:48.886 --> 01:01:53.490]  Subject that has kept captured my imagination and today.
[01:01:53.710 --> 01:02:15.167]  It's everywhere It's in newspapers as I said everywhere you look as the symbol that I have been working with and looking out for a long time and the implications are just staggering Hollywood has been pouring today Hollywood is pouring out the symbol everywhere and movies and television and songs especially music
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:25.404]  So, you know, I've just got some very, very impressive and important stuff that I really would like to be able to do.
[01:02:25.484 --> 01:02:26.264]  Sure, sure, we'll do it.
[01:02:26.304 --> 01:02:27.124]  We're going to do it soon.
[01:02:27.605 --> 01:02:43.711]  I'm finishing this Obama film, and I've just been waiting for you, Jordan, since we're talking about it here on air, to tell me the best way to quickly come out to California for, say, a week, shoot it in a proper setting, and then get direction from you on how you want it laid out, and we can get it done very quickly.
[01:02:45.772 --> 01:03:13.071]  What I'd like to do is I'd like to have you see, I'd like to do a PowerPoint presentation, which I have it pretty much already done here on my computer, and I have terabytes of material, I mean just enormous amounts of material on these subjects, but I'd like to run this whole story by you and have you see the progression of where I start and where I end with this symbol.
[01:03:13.672 --> 01:03:18.353]  So that for the first time, you will see the importance of what I'm actually talking about.
[01:03:18.973 --> 01:03:29.796]  Because I believe, it's just my belief, that if you were to see what I have amassed over these 40 years, it will be staggering to anyone seeing it.
[01:03:29.976 --> 01:03:32.756]  Well, let me make a wild guess at it, Jordan.
[01:03:33.317 --> 01:03:36.077]  The elite are preparing the earth for the arrival of an entity.
[01:03:36.117 --> 01:03:36.797]  That's what they believe, right?
[01:03:36.817 --> 01:03:37.117]  That's right.
[01:03:37.618 --> 01:03:38.098]  Exactly.
[01:03:40.676 --> 01:04:06.876]  As far back as the ancient world, they were using a particular symbol, the ancient kings were, and the ancient princes were using this symbol everywhere, and as I said, the Greeks used it, it was used in Egypt, it was used in Babylonia, and especially was it used in the Roman Empire, and then of course coming into Britannia and into Europe, it was everywhere.
[01:04:07.598 --> 01:04:34.790]  uh... among the royals of europe and now in america it is everywhere and unless you go back to the beginning and see what this thing really meant and trace it through history and begin to see how ancient this apparatus really is it's not going to really hit you and until you see it and when you finally see it for the first time it will be shocking to the world to know this stuff goes back
[01:04:36.283 --> 01:04:37.624]  Thousands of years.
[01:04:38.364 --> 01:04:44.567]  Jordan Maxwell, why is Kissinger and others hailing Obama as the one that will unify the world and bring in the new world order?
[01:04:44.927 --> 01:04:46.007]  Or is that wishful thinking?
[01:04:46.107 --> 01:04:48.008]  I mean, why would they be saying that now about a leader?
[01:04:48.729 --> 01:05:02.795]  I think that they already, because of the symbols that he's using, because of the symbols, words and terms that he's using, it implies for me that this is a very long, well laid out plan.
[01:05:03.573 --> 01:05:29.607]  That I was seeing already, and back in 67, they were laying out the words, the terms, the strategy, and how it was going to come about, the words that would be used, the symbols that would be used, and now to see this happening today with Obama tells me that this is the combination, this is the final blow on the earth of something that I've been aware of for 40 years,
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:33.301]  And the world has been talking about for thousands of years.
[01:05:33.681 --> 01:05:38.862]  It's a very powerful story once you finally see it.
[01:05:38.942 --> 01:05:39.402]  Stay there!
[01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:40.582]  Long segment coming up.
[01:05:40.682 --> 01:05:41.682]  What is this force?
[01:05:41.742 --> 01:05:48.844]  This dark force that whether people believe in it or not, the elite believe in it and everything they do is designed to bring this in.
[01:05:49.644 --> 01:05:50.104]  Stay with us.
[01:05:50.124 --> 01:05:52.025]  JordanMaxwell.com is his website.
[01:05:52.285 --> 01:05:54.765]  Our sites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:05:54.785 --> 01:05:55.165]  Stay with us.
[01:05:55.405 --> 01:05:56.326]  We're on the march.
[01:05:56.806 --> 01:05:58.306]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:05:59.335 --> 01:06:02.117]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:05.599 --> 01:06:07.140]  These are strange new days.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.261]  Foreclosures are at record highs.
[01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:10.802]  People are losing their jobs.
[01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:13.064]  The threat of a terrorist attack looms.
[01:06:13.304 --> 01:06:17.787]  Food supplies are at an all-time low, and now we have a new untested president.
[01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:24.551]  The time of change is upon us, and to those of you who are in the know, you realize that the most difficult times have yet to be seen.
[01:06:25.212 --> 01:06:27.713]  Self-preparedness is the key to survival.
[01:06:27.933 --> 01:06:28.814]  Internet grocer and
[01:06:30.816 --> 01:06:31.077]  I think so.
[01:06:46.511 --> 01:06:48.713]  Call 903-356-6443.
[01:06:50.394 --> 01:06:56.259]  That's 903-356-6443 from 9 a.m.
[01:06:56.399 --> 01:06:57.059]  to 6 p.m.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.100]  Central Standard Time.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.303]  Or shop online at internet-grocer.net.
[01:07:01.763 --> 01:07:04.585]  Again, that's internet-grocer.net.
[01:07:05.246 --> 01:07:11.651]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:07:12.011 --> 01:07:13.673]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:15.645]  But who is the enemy?
[01:07:16.186 --> 01:07:16.666]  Bin Laden.
[01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:17.987]  This is his M.O.
[01:07:18.007 --> 01:07:19.287]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:20.988]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:07:21.348 --> 01:07:28.091]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:07:28.491 --> 01:07:28.931]  Some U.S.
[01:07:28.971 --> 01:07:34.614]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:07:35.314 --> 01:07:38.755]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:07:38.775 --> 01:07:40.956]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:08:07.165 --> 01:08:12.448]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[01:08:12.909 --> 01:08:14.650]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:16.671]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[01:08:17.332 --> 01:08:20.894]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[01:08:21.334 --> 01:08:24.817]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[01:08:25.317 --> 01:08:29.960]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of
[01:08:35.981 --> 01:08:36.742]  Great to see you!
[01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:26.812]  We're good.
[01:09:52.225 --> 01:09:58.991]  We are back live with a real legend in the fight against the globalist, the New World Order, Jordan Maxwell.
[01:09:59.031 --> 01:09:59.892]  Jordanmaxwell.com.
[01:10:00.433 --> 01:10:12.303]  And Jordan, I'm about to be out of town for a few days, but if you really want to do that, just try to figure out a time and place how you want to do it, and do it as quickly, but also with the quality that you want.
[01:10:12.784 --> 01:10:17.188]  So I'd be honored to work on a film and present your findings to people.
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.581]  And I'm honored that you've said that you'd like to work with me.
[01:10:22.402 --> 01:10:32.005]  Separately, in the 27 minutes of airtime we have left here today, I want to explain to people, whether they believe in the supernatural or not, the elite do.
[01:10:32.386 --> 01:10:33.186]  And that's a fact.
[01:10:33.486 --> 01:10:38.308]  And there's different mystery religions, but they all basically have the same tenets as you go up the pyramidal power structure.
[01:10:39.589 --> 01:10:42.390]  But you're saying in your research, the highest level
[01:10:43.416 --> 01:11:10.206]  Cult, is this Sunrise Cult, or the Morning Star Cult, and clearly, you know, Oprah Winfrey, her symbol, governmental symbols, Obama, we are seeing it more and more, and they believe they manifest the power by that, and when you study the beliefs of this cult, let us in on a little bit of your own research on that, and why this is such a dangerous time and so horrifying for humanity, in your research.
[01:11:12.205 --> 01:11:14.406]  It's hard to put into words, as I said.
[01:11:15.186 --> 01:11:21.669]  You need to, it's not something that I could just come out and shoot for a couple of days and it's done.
[01:11:21.829 --> 01:11:23.630]  No, this subject is too big.
[01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:37.196]  I've got quite literally hundreds and hundreds of documents, pictures, photographs explaining this story because it's not easy to talk about.
[01:11:37.216 --> 01:11:41.378]  It's not easy to tell because it's too simple to just mention
[01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:47.287]  You know, a particular cult and a particular symbol, nobody gets the effect of it.
[01:11:47.527 --> 01:12:11.006]  It's when you sit down and you begin to see how Hollywood has used this, how the motion picture industry, how the news organizations, the symbols that are used in government, the symbols which are used in federal and state seals, and going back into the British Empire and tracing it back, then you begin to see how all-encompassing
[01:12:11.582 --> 01:12:12.523]  And Arthur C. Clarke?
[01:12:30.875 --> 01:12:32.977]  And I'm just appalled.
[01:12:32.997 --> 01:12:42.785]  So you're saying, how do you express a huge research that is the continuity of human history and this great mystery?
[01:12:42.865 --> 01:12:43.846]  That's exactly right.
[01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:48.850]  And I'm at a loss to do that because I don't have the funding to do something like that.
[01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:56.497]  I've got all kinds of professional people on the West Coast and Hollywood who know me and who know that my work has served as the
[01:12:57.413 --> 01:13:10.524]  As a means spring for many television shows and movies and books and all kinds of people are using, you know, my stuff over the years because I share it freely with everyone in Hollywood.
[01:13:10.724 --> 01:13:20.252]  I've been here for 48 years, so everyone knows that, but, and they've used stuff directly out of Da Vinci Code, used things directly out of my videos.
[01:13:20.892 --> 01:13:25.156]  The whole concept of the conspiratorial apparatus
[01:13:25.717 --> 01:13:26.137]  Tell me about it.
[01:13:49.625 --> 01:14:00.333]  Because I know, until this thing can be done right, I don't want to put out... Well, Jordan, last time we talked and you brought this up to me, just tell me what your blueprint is and how you want it done.
[01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:03.375]  And if you do want me to work on it with you, I'd be glad to.
[01:14:03.415 --> 01:14:05.017]  But regardless, just get it done.
[01:14:05.077 --> 01:14:08.119]  Get this information out to people, regardless of who does it.
[01:14:08.659 --> 01:14:09.700]  Make sure you get it done.
[01:14:10.341 --> 01:14:14.744]  Well, I know, because I don't want to leave this planet until this work is done.
[01:14:14.864 --> 01:14:17.206]  And that's something that has caught my attention
[01:14:17.748 --> 01:14:23.569]  For over 40 years I've been looking at this one subject and it's very, very powerful stuff.
[01:14:24.329 --> 01:14:29.631]  And I can't think of anybody that could do more with it than you.
[01:14:29.651 --> 01:14:40.333]  And so that's why I'd like to have you a part of this because I'd like for you to handle it and put it out there because I don't have the wherewithal to do any of this.
[01:14:41.693 --> 01:14:46.154]  I need somebody that has a system already in operation that can distribute
[01:14:46.698 --> 01:14:55.565]  And Ken get to the largest amount of people and you have a huge audience so that's why I mentioned before that I'd like to maybe possibly do something
[01:14:56.058 --> 01:15:00.800]  With you in relation to this subject, but you're going to have to see it for yourself first.
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:05.183]  Jordan, what I'll do is, I'm going to be out on the West Coast soon, very soon.
[01:15:05.203 --> 01:15:10.305]  In fact, I'm about to be out there this weekend, but I have something else I have to do.
[01:15:11.086 --> 01:15:13.527]  So I need to come out there and see you.
[01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:15.168]  Yes, yes.
[01:15:15.448 --> 01:15:21.191]  I would like for you to come here, see me, sit here and spend an hour here and let me just go through
[01:15:22.469 --> 01:15:24.210]  The best, you know, the basics.
[01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:33.932]  Let me just go through it slowly and show you the progression of the story so at least you have in your mind the concept and how large it really is.
[01:15:33.952 --> 01:15:35.533]  Alright, well I'm honored.
[01:15:35.813 --> 01:15:36.873]  Let's pull the trigger on it.
[01:15:36.913 --> 01:15:39.114]  I'll get out there as soon as I can when it's a good date for you.
[01:15:39.174 --> 01:15:40.254]  It's been a couple days at least.
[01:15:40.654 --> 01:15:42.534]  Like you said, you were saying it would take a while.
[01:15:42.815 --> 01:15:44.335]  I've got more time than an hour if you've got it.
[01:15:44.915 --> 01:15:46.676]  And then just tell me how you want it done.
[01:15:46.716 --> 01:15:47.956]  Let's pull the trigger on it, Jordan.
[01:15:48.676 --> 01:15:49.717]  I think it would be great.
[01:15:50.137 --> 01:15:51.618]  Well, thank you.
[01:15:51.638 --> 01:15:52.319]  This is exciting.
[01:15:52.699 --> 01:15:55.501]  We have so many of these discussions on the air.
[01:15:55.521 --> 01:15:58.123]  Perhaps we might have it privately as well.
[01:15:58.143 --> 01:15:58.904]  Yes.
[01:15:59.164 --> 01:16:13.575]  Because I'm telling you, Alex, I have something here that I know is so explosive and so incredibly mind-boggling when it's finally presented correctly.
[01:16:14.099 --> 01:16:36.336]  So that you begin to see the progression of the use of this symbol, how it is used by the different cults, different religions of the world, how it is used by the different governments, all governments of the world, all the royalty of Europe have used this word and terms and symbols, and then to see it now finally on full display right now in America,
[01:16:36.903 --> 01:16:40.426]  It will finally hit you how big this thing really is.
[01:16:40.526 --> 01:17:00.161]  And that signifies though, that's what I keep asking, I mean, the fact that they're now going with everything, they suddenly display the symbol, you know, moving away from the eye to the rising sun, over the earth, they move into that, which I guess signifies in their hierarchy, and correct me if I'm wrong, that they are now engaging, what, the final plan?
[01:17:00.701 --> 01:17:06.566]  Yes, yes, the ultimate final conclusion to thousands of years
[01:17:07.914 --> 01:17:25.745]  of a plan that was laid out a long time ago is finally being blanketed across the world and no one is able to comprehend how large this thing is, how big it is and the implications of it.
[01:17:26.645 --> 01:17:31.268]  It's just a staggering story and I don't even know what to do with it.
[01:17:31.328 --> 01:17:36.512]  I don't even know how to explain to the audience how big this thing really is.
[01:17:37.222 --> 01:17:37.622]  How are you?
[01:17:55.319 --> 01:17:58.039]  Into the new light of a new world order.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.620]  Well, did you hear his acceptance speech?
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.561]  Where he kept saying the new age, the new age, the new age.
[01:18:04.601 --> 01:18:07.601]  Barack Obama, well, his inaugural speech.
[01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:08.461]  Please continue.
[01:18:08.981 --> 01:18:09.821]  Yes, I know.
[01:18:10.782 --> 01:18:13.282]  It's all part and parcel of what I'm talking about.
[01:18:13.542 --> 01:18:15.502]  Coming into the new age, coming into the new light.
[01:18:15.983 --> 01:18:17.703]  Why are you saying that's so dangerous?
[01:18:18.563 --> 01:18:24.264]  It is profoundly dangerous because the people who are doing it aren't...
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:45.931]  They have, look it, the best way I can explain it is that for years, kids, years ago, kids used to talk on the phone in front of their parents and use terms, and they still do today, they could use terms and catchphrases which the young people understand but which the adults don't.
[01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:53.495]  And so the kids could be sitting right in the front room talking in front of their parents and talking about a drug deal or something really nefarious,
[01:18:54.048 --> 01:19:00.870]  And the parents are hearing it and they don't understand at all the terms that are being used and the catchphrases, what they mean.
[01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:05.291]  Well, the same thing is true today with the elite who are running the world.
[01:19:05.851 --> 01:19:07.411]  They have a lingo.
[01:19:07.471 --> 01:19:13.733]  They have symbols of words and terms that they use among themselves, that they know what they're talking about.
[01:19:14.113 --> 01:19:20.814]  And they realize that the people of the world have no idea about what they're saying, what it means.
[01:19:21.615 --> 01:19:23.455]  And once you've cracked this code,
[01:19:24.125 --> 01:19:28.686]  Of words and terms, it's staggering and it's frightening in its implications.
[01:19:28.826 --> 01:19:30.107]  And that's what I've got.
[01:19:30.507 --> 01:19:41.930]  Because they're saying, at least with the Earth First Battalion and what the Pentagon says and what General Stubblebot and others have said, that the New Age means killing most of us, doesn't it?
[01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:43.611]  Oh, I'm afraid so, yes.
[01:19:43.751 --> 01:19:47.012]  Because it's part of the agenda.
[01:19:48.010 --> 01:19:54.075]  And the new man, the cybernetic merger of humans and machines and the extermination of the majority of us.
[01:19:54.435 --> 01:20:03.181]  That's right, because they are dumbing down the humans while making the machines and the computers able to think for themselves.
[01:20:03.261 --> 01:20:07.644]  And so in America, we like to brag that we've got computers that can think for themselves.
[01:20:07.704 --> 01:20:09.686]  And I say, thank God, because the people can't.
[01:20:10.413 --> 01:20:17.558]  So the new age, one facet, I don't want to oversimplify it all, but one facet of the new age is the new man, the new creation.
[01:20:17.939 --> 01:20:18.479]  That's right.
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.961]  And the old man goes bye-bye.
[01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:22.442]  You've got it.
[01:20:22.682 --> 01:20:25.884]  That's exactly one of the most important terms is the new man.
[01:20:26.385 --> 01:20:38.734]  And when you begin to see what that term new man actually implies, and why Adolf Hitler talked about all the time creating the new man, why Stalin in his writings talked about
[01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:51.352]  The coming of the new man, when you see the communist symbols and words and terms that were used by the Communist Party around the world, talking about the coming of the new man, when the sun would rise on the new order.
[01:20:52.033 --> 01:21:04.655]  Once you begin to see this, then you see how very powerful and ancient and old and well-financed this whole monstrosity on the human race really is, and then for the first time,
[01:21:05.168 --> 01:21:08.951]  You begin to see how serious in trouble we really are.
[01:21:25.262 --> 01:21:27.744]  Exactly, and that's happened to me on many different fronts.
[01:21:28.064 --> 01:21:32.767]  Because I will use terms that are in the Bible, and I'm trying to explain what they mean in relation to my research
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:22:04.846]  Then people go out and say, well, Jordan is saying this, this, and that, and therefore he obviously is working for the government, he's working for the conspiracy, and I'm just appalled because I'm not able to really
[01:22:05.410 --> 01:22:07.771]  Don't put anything out there into the public for them.
[01:22:07.791 --> 01:22:11.072]  Because this is so nuanced and sophisticated and multifaceted.
[01:22:11.492 --> 01:22:18.794]  You're saying they're going to come in with the dictatorship of the machines and the cyborg, cybernetic merger and other things that they say are coming.
[01:22:19.054 --> 01:22:30.118]  You're saying, you know, they've built all of this to then have a false revolution and bring in this control and then others come and take your research, get everybody on board with the research and then say, but the new man, that will fix it.
[01:22:30.878 --> 01:22:33.559]  The false revolution, the false new age.
[01:22:34.079 --> 01:22:37.101]  Well, that's exactly what the Bible talks about, how the devil works.
[01:22:37.181 --> 01:22:51.853]  I mean, even in Scripture, even in Christianity, Christians are aware that there is a concept that the dark side will use what is good to deceive, and that even the elect to be deceived is so well done.
[01:22:51.873 --> 01:22:53.054]  Counterfeits!
[01:22:53.394 --> 01:22:53.934]  Counterfeits!
[01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:55.275]  Absolutely.
[01:22:55.375 --> 01:22:56.476]  It's counterfeit.
[01:22:58.037 --> 01:23:03.682]  But unless you understand and are able to sit for an hour or so and watch
[01:23:04.566 --> 01:23:18.276]  A presentation that was showing the symbols that were used thousands of years ago, used in Rome, used in England, and today are being used here, finally hit you what I'm talking about.
[01:23:18.416 --> 01:23:19.977]  It's something you have to see.
[01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:25.741]  You have to watch the progression in order to understand the severity of what I'm talking about.
[01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:28.523]  Well, I'm honored.
[01:23:29.724 --> 01:23:32.666]  Let's get on the horn very soon and set up a time to do that.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:41.548]  Without giving out the deep knowledge you've got, which you know will then be misconstrued, mispackaged, thus destroying the message.
[01:23:41.568 --> 01:23:43.109]  That's why you can't come out with it.
[01:23:44.231 --> 01:23:48.256]  We're on the same page, I know you've done deeper research than I, but you notice I'm throwing out basically what it is here.
[01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:53.971]  Just talking about what we're facing in the upheaval.
[01:23:54.011 --> 01:23:55.211]  More staged terror attacks.
[01:23:55.551 --> 01:23:56.611]  More economic collapse.
[01:23:56.751 --> 01:23:58.312]  Open World Government Bank being set up.
[01:23:58.592 --> 01:24:01.753]  Carbon taxes with bureaucratic regulators over every facet of our lives.
[01:24:02.053 --> 01:24:04.494]  Shutting down all small industry farms and ranches.
[01:24:05.194 --> 01:24:06.254]  Gun confiscation.
[01:24:06.714 --> 01:24:07.695]  Giant youth brigades.
[01:24:07.795 --> 01:24:08.915]  It's all being announced.
[01:24:09.155 --> 01:24:10.456]  I think it is the final, last and final move.
[01:24:10.476 --> 01:24:11.196]  In my humble opinion.
[01:24:30.757 --> 01:24:31.898]  This is it.
[01:24:32.038 --> 01:24:34.040]  There is nothing to come after this.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.621]  You have never said that before.
[01:24:35.661 --> 01:24:38.183]  You have never said that in 49 years of research.
[01:24:38.203 --> 01:24:39.364]  You've never said, this is it.
[01:24:39.924 --> 01:24:40.385]  This is it.
[01:24:40.445 --> 01:24:51.513]  But as far as I'm concerned, there is no doubt in my mind because I've watched the steps and watched it progress over the years and looked at it from every point of view.
[01:24:51.613 --> 01:24:59.780]  I've taken this to other authors, writers, researchers in private and they're looking at it and we're studying this thing.
[01:25:00.626 --> 01:25:16.677]  Up until now I have always believed that there was going to be some way that people would wake up and find out and be able to thwart this thing, but now I am totally convinced that the last and final stroke has been put into place now and now
[01:25:17.421 --> 01:25:19.983]  It's a survival of the human race now.
[01:25:20.244 --> 01:25:22.525]  Now it is cosmic in proportion.
[01:25:22.806 --> 01:25:30.172]  Because once the elite engage all these thousands of years of programming, conditioning, and preparation, this isn't even a machine they can turn off, is it?
[01:25:30.372 --> 01:25:31.553]  That's right, exactly.
[01:25:31.613 --> 01:25:34.275]  It's not something that they have control over anymore.
[01:25:34.375 --> 01:25:36.938]  Now it is cosmic in proportion.
[01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:39.740]  It's the basis for governments.
[01:25:40.421 --> 01:25:41.922]  The symbol is used in
[01:25:42.518 --> 01:25:46.859]  And governmental systems, educational systems, law enforcement, military.
[01:25:46.879 --> 01:25:57.601]  And you're saying there is an above, let's just get down to the bottom line, Christians can call it spiritual entities, whatever, the elite believe this in their own writings, there is an above human government that's been directing things.
[01:25:57.781 --> 01:25:58.881]  Oh, you can bet on that.
[01:25:58.941 --> 01:26:00.281]  There is no doubt in my mind.
[01:26:00.301 --> 01:26:06.462]  That's why so many people have asked and talked about my religious faith as to whether I believe in God.
[01:26:06.582 --> 01:26:09.563]  I have no problem at all believing in God.
[01:26:09.723 --> 01:26:11.743]  I have no problem believing in the divine
[01:26:12.273 --> 01:26:16.954]  Because I have studied the occult world for many, many years.
[01:26:17.174 --> 01:26:26.997]  I know what these symbols and religions, where they've come from, how they were co-opted, put into use by the elite powers of the world.
[01:26:27.557 --> 01:26:34.839]  I have no doubt in my mind that there is a God, and I have nothing but praise and honor for spirituality.
[01:26:35.239 --> 01:26:41.601]  But I'm telling you, and at this point I don't even care how people view this statement,
[01:26:42.170 --> 01:26:48.376]  The religions of this world are, just as the scripture says, all flesh has lost its way.
[01:26:48.456 --> 01:26:55.984]  You have no idea in the world to what extent religions have been co-opted by the dark side, and it's right in your face.
[01:26:56.564 --> 01:26:57.485]  We just don't see it.
[01:26:58.046 --> 01:26:59.688]  And the dark side always tells riddles.
[01:27:00.068 --> 01:27:01.209]  They say they're bringing the light.
[01:27:01.649 --> 01:27:03.291]  They're really bringing the dark sunshine.
[01:27:03.311 --> 01:27:04.753]  They're bringing the darkness.
[01:27:05.697 --> 01:27:09.519]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.

[01:29:07.877 --> 01:29:11.179]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:29:11.659 --> 01:29:17.582]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.

[01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:33.831]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios,
[01:29:33.891 --> 01:29:34.251]  I think?
[01:29:55.385 --> 01:29:55.645]  Call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:55.665 --> 01:29:55.705]  877-327-0365.
[01:29:55.725 --> 01:29:56.186]  Don't wait.
[01:29:56.226 --> 01:29:56.526]  Call today.
[01:29:56.566 --> 01:29:59.088]  Think of how dear and sweet the children of the world are.
[01:29:59.108 --> 01:29:59.948]  How innocent.
[01:30:00.089 --> 01:30:01.730]  The light of God in their eyes.
[01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:02.330]  Think about
[01:30:21.829 --> 01:30:25.452]  All the people that have struggled against tyranny and oppression so that we have some modicum of liberty.
[01:30:26.693 --> 01:30:32.879]  And then think about the great darkness the new world order is forging, all their crimes, all the wicked things they've done, how they enjoy hurting the innocent.
[01:30:33.976 --> 01:30:36.457]  We are in an eternal fight against evil.
[01:30:36.517 --> 01:30:37.758]  It is good versus evil.
[01:30:38.278 --> 01:30:41.159]  And evil is making its greatest move in history.
[01:30:42.039 --> 01:30:47.261]  Right now, all of the, in the elites' own words, planets are aligned.
[01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:49.062]  They are going into high gear.
[01:30:49.102 --> 01:30:52.604]  They believe this is their jump point, their move.
[01:30:54.704 --> 01:31:00.627]  We have no future if we don't struggle and fight back and speak out now and have a mass awakening against this system.
[01:31:02.628 --> 01:31:08.736]  Jordan, just in summation, because the show's basically over, how do you see this last four minutes playing out?
[01:31:09.237 --> 01:31:12.201]  I mean, is there a light at the end of the tunnel that isn't a freight train coming at us?
[01:31:12.661 --> 01:31:16.406]  Is there a way if people... I mean, I see folks actually waking up in mass.
[01:31:17.107 --> 01:31:19.430]  I mean, they're not waking up to the sophistication of the attack,
[01:31:19.991 --> 01:31:20.752]  I appreciate what you're saying.
[01:31:20.772 --> 01:31:24.795]  For myself, I just question whether the human race is going to be able to extricate itself out of this mess.
[01:31:47.270 --> 01:32:16.325]  Because unless and until you understand what your enemy is really all about, and what is actually happening here, and you know, the military has planners and people in the CIA who plan things, and getting intelligence, and as far as I'm concerned, I don't see much intelligence being done in the so-called truth movement, because they haven't, they do not have a grasp
[01:32:17.017 --> 01:32:19.680]  On the cosmic size of this thing.
[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:24.103]  We're all looking at the different problems and they're all right there in your face.
[01:32:24.284 --> 01:32:26.846]  And we're looking at low level puppets and minions and front men.
[01:32:27.466 --> 01:32:28.928]  Right, and that's what we're looking at.
[01:32:29.268 --> 01:32:30.229]  Yeah, never looking past it.
[01:32:30.769 --> 01:32:32.170]  But never looking past it.
[01:32:32.371 --> 01:32:36.354]  I'm telling you there's something far, far bigger and far worse.
[01:32:36.995 --> 01:32:40.458]  The implications are absolutely frightening for the human race.
[01:32:40.558 --> 01:32:42.920]  And I've been working on this for a long time.
[01:32:43.684 --> 01:32:46.725]  And I would like to be able to do something with it before I leave here.
[01:32:46.885 --> 01:33:00.030]  But is God, is God, I mean, is the creative, you know, energy of the universe, the creator, I mean, will God allow that to happen?
[01:33:00.710 --> 01:33:02.690]  Well, that's another subject.
[01:33:02.891 --> 01:33:09.033]  I hate to talk about it because I don't want to offend anybody, but by their fruits you will know them.
[01:33:09.393 --> 01:33:12.874]  Christianity is praying every day for protection,
[01:33:13.427 --> 01:33:21.190]  For this and for that, for God to help them, and yet darkness is growing on the earth every day, goodness is dying every day.
[01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:30.493]  Anytime any wisdom is out there or anything of any real value, the dark side will crush it and crush it out of existence.
[01:33:31.093 --> 01:33:41.037]  So, I'm just saying that people who have religious beliefs have better start looking at where their religious church and beliefs have actually come from.
[01:33:41.986 --> 01:33:48.830]  And what these words actually mean, but just a blind faith is not going to help anything anymore.
[01:33:49.151 --> 01:33:53.713]  We are in serious trouble and people have better start looking for the real truth.
[01:33:54.354 --> 01:33:57.055]  Because the more you pray, the worse things are getting.
[01:33:57.396 --> 01:34:02.599]  And until you understand who your enemy is, and understand it thoroughly and correctly,
[01:34:03.106 --> 01:34:06.388]  You're never going to be able to get yourself out of the mess you're in.
[01:34:06.408 --> 01:34:10.650]  Yeah, most religious people, especially Christians, think they're praying to one God and they're praying to another.
[01:34:10.670 --> 01:34:11.211]  That's what you're saying.
[01:34:11.231 --> 01:34:12.071]  You got that right.
[01:34:12.151 --> 01:34:13.432]  That's exactly what's happening.
[01:34:13.971 --> 01:34:16.172]  All right, Jordan, I will talk to you very soon.
[01:34:17.052 --> 01:34:19.893]  In fact, I'll even call you this evening if that's a good time, or tomorrow.
[01:34:19.913 --> 01:34:21.033]  That's fine, that's fine.
[01:34:21.474 --> 01:34:25.435]  Make sure everyone goes on the website and check it out, because I got a lot of stuff there.
[01:34:25.535 --> 01:34:28.056]  And a lot of books and key videos, jordanmaxwell.com.

[01:34:31.497 --> 01:34:32.597]  We'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[01:34:33.038 --> 01:34:33.598]  Thank you again.
[01:34:33.698 --> 01:34:34.018]  Bye-bye.
[01:34:34.418 --> 01:34:34.978]  There he goes.
[01:34:35.018 --> 01:34:36.139]  Jordan Maxwell's out of here.

[01:34:56.796 --> 01:35:01.383]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:35:01.543 --> 01:35:04.307]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:35:04.507 --> 01:35:07.351]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:35:07.551 --> 01:35:12.278]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:35:12.478 --> 01:35:13.419]  If you simply prepare.
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:16.564]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
