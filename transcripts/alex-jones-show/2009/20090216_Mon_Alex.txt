[00:00:01.148 --> 00:00:06.731]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:20.317]  One of the biggest problems in the United States is organized religion.
[00:00:21.418 --> 00:00:25.040]  Not just Christians, but Hindus, Muslims, other people.
[00:00:27.253 --> 00:00:34.899]  The leaders of their denominations have been funded openly by governments and corporations to preach doctrines of submission to government, submission to tyranny.
[00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:39.662]  Christians in the last 150 years have been taught they're not to fight evil, they're to lay down to corruption.
[00:00:40.103 --> 00:00:44.046]  When all the major prophets were killed or tortured or imprisoned and Christ himself was killed.
[00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:56.755]  They don't want you to know that it was the pastors who led the revolt against the British in 1776, the Black Brigade as they were known, because regardless of denomination they tend to wear black suits.
[00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:05.681]  And they want to hold up these pulpit prostitutes like Benny Hinn and the rest of them to make religion look bad, to make Christianity look bad.
[00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:11.033]  And then the rest of the Christian community spends most of its time infighting with each other.
[00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:14.996]  That's why this is a news show and we cover news and information.
[00:01:15.056 --> 00:01:17.058]  It is a secular fact.
[00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:26.887]  See, as soon as you get into religion, people out there who aren't Christian, who aren't, who are agnostic, who don't believe in anything, you know, Einstein believed in God because he studied the universe.
[00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:27.908]  His mind could grasp it.
[00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.510]  You can see the intelligent design everywhere.
[00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:33.392]  But regardless of that,
[00:01:34.364 --> 00:01:37.306]  They want to make it a religious debate.
[00:01:38.206 --> 00:01:48.012]  That's why when I cover the occultic activities at Skull and Bones or Bohemian Grove or by the United Nations and Maury Strong out in Colorado, they go, oh, I'm an atheist, I don't believe in that stuff.
[00:01:48.352 --> 00:02:03.701]  Okay, well, as an anthropologist, as a psychologist, as someone studying society, is it a little unusual that we have world leaders who are involved in a Luciferian slash goddess cult and believe they want to bring in a one world government to exterminate 80% of the world for Gaia?
[00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:05.978]  I mean, that's what they believe.
[00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:09.800]  That's in the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment, 89-96.
[00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:29.753]  You know, the Pentagon's written stuff like the Earth First Battalion, that's where that term came from, in the seventies, saying that they're the pale horse rider death, they're going to bring in world government, they're going to kill the majority of us, and Spangler and others, NCFR publications, like Foreign Affairs have said all of us will take a luciferian pledge before we initiate.
[00:02:30.513 --> 00:02:31.693]  Okay, you're an atheist.
[00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:32.914]  What do you make of that?
[00:02:33.094 --> 00:02:34.474]  You think religion's stupid?
[00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:35.674]  You think we're all kooks?
[00:02:36.014 --> 00:02:37.715]  You know, you say, oh, you believe in Jesus?
[00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:39.215]  I'll believe in the spaghetti monster.
[00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:40.795]  Or I'll believe in the tooth fairy.
[00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:43.996]  Or, you know, like Bill Hicks said, you believe in the tooth fairy?
[00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:48.477]  Well, I mean, how about I'm saying a little elf is putting Lincoln Logs in your dresser.
[00:02:49.017 --> 00:02:49.918]  You know, whatever.
[00:02:50.978 --> 00:02:55.519]  My whole issue is, why is it only Christians who are kooks if they believe in a creator, but
[00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:00.505]  We all know the UN is pushing this one-world religion.
[00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:04.349]  We make films about it, we cover it, we constantly get into it.
[00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.094]  But I tell you, I talk to a lot of Christians and they go, oh, I know the New World Order is real.
[00:03:10.134 --> 00:03:11.676]  Praise God, I'll be out of here soon.
[00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:14.559]  And I'll go, well, don't you want to warn your friends and family?
[00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.020]  Well, that's just the way it is.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.942]  If they don't repent, they'll go to hell.
[00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:18.983]  They won't be raptured.
[00:03:20.404 --> 00:03:21.525]  The Antichrist will get them.
[00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:23.642]  What a cop-out!
[00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:26.764]  People thought it was the Antichrist in Europe with Hitler.
[00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:36.547]  Russian Christians and Ukrainian Christians, when Stalin and, before him, Lenin were killing him, thought that it was the end of the world and, you know, they were going to stand down.
[00:03:36.807 --> 00:03:40.029]  The Aztecs laid down to the conquistadors because they thought it was the end of the world.
[00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:41.549]  Thought they were gods.
[00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.591]  Some Native American tribes laid down.
[00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:50.676]  And, you know, did a ghost dance and, you know, I mean, I'm not laying down to evil.
[00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:52.438]  I'm not going to take the coward's way out.
[00:03:52.938 --> 00:04:00.024]  And my Bible, but also history and common sense shows that I need to stand up against tyranny and corruption and say no to evil.
[00:04:01.906 --> 00:04:06.149]  And so, really, I don't want to be associated with what is known as a Christian today.
[00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.411]  I don't want to be associated with any of that.
[00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:10.693]  Because that isn't what's in my Bible.
[00:04:11.638 --> 00:04:18.524]  You can go off with your Romans 13, and they celebrate when the news is pushing implantable chips, and they celebrate all this talk of war with Russia.
[00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:20.425]  Oh, we're going to be out of here soon!
[00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:26.350]  And when they're not out of here, and the things that are coming, they are going to lose their faith.
[00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:27.892]  See, it's all a trap.
[00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:29.393]  This is very sophisticated.
[00:04:30.848 --> 00:04:37.571]  And I'll tell you, I've found, you know, I judge a tree by its fruits, and I've found atheists and agnostics, by and large, are very unhappy people.
[00:04:38.332 --> 00:04:41.453]  Why do they care if old people are being euthanized, or children are starving to death?
[00:04:41.493 --> 00:04:53.639]  You know, we're all just animals anyways, and it's all social Darwinism, and, you know, humans are bad, and we're a parasite, and, you know, there's not this belief that there's the divine, there's the outside of us, there's the larger universe.
[00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:02.202]  We're on a planet hurtling through space around a sun with billions of galaxies all around us that Hubble Space Telescope can see.
[00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.964]  There's so many mysteries, so many dimensions, so many things we don't know.
[00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:18.999]  But if they can get you to decide, I'm just like a bacteria, I'm just like a mold, I'm nothing, I'm not special, then the establishment can say, oh but the animals are.
[00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.140]  We're going to represent the animals and they're going to out-vote you so you're going to lose your property rights now.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.041]  It's all about control.
[00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:34.364]  So, perhaps I should have some pastures on that I do respect.
[00:05:34.404 --> 00:05:38.405]  Go over Romans 13 and go over what's happened to our churches and what they've turned into.
[00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.251]  But regardless, I come at this with the news and the information.
[00:05:43.512 --> 00:05:49.435]  And it's a million times more successful than some preacher on a street corner screaming at people who are drunk coming out of bars.
[00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:50.196]  They just laugh at them.
[00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:54.578]  Now I'm not saying going out on the street for anything political or religious is bad.
[00:05:54.618 --> 00:05:55.279]  That's a great thing.
[00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.920]  But you see the way they do it, it turns people off.
[00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:59.081]  You need to reach out to them.
[00:06:01.303 --> 00:06:04.465]  We're in a lot of trouble as a society.
[00:06:05.976 --> 00:06:10.877]  On another issue of Solutions, all we offer here on this radio show is solutions.
[00:06:10.977 --> 00:06:13.597]  If you listen to every hour of the show, what's the big solution?
[00:06:13.638 --> 00:06:31.321]  Waking people up, reaching out, so people understand the political minefield they're in, so they understand the society they're in, so they know the people perish for lack of knowledge, so they know offshore banks are setting up a world government, so they know they're setting up a global central bank to control our nation with carbon taxes to regulate every facet of our lives.
[00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:39.410]  So they know that the entire NORTHCOM system is built around blocking the states from resisting a federal takeover.
[00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:43.271]  That's a huge solution.
[00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.112]  Learning about what the gun bills are and raising a hue and cry.
[00:06:47.212 --> 00:06:48.272]  Raising the alarm.
[00:06:48.632 --> 00:06:49.552]  That is the key.
[00:06:50.413 --> 00:06:54.873]  And then once you have a cadre of educated people, which we have, getting you to go out and educate others.
[00:06:55.294 --> 00:06:57.234]  And educate them that action is needed.
[00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:05.721]  Take what we've done just in the last month, in a few days, beating the drum of states' rights to this federal takeover.
[00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:09.202]  The outrage is there, the public's waking up, now we need to take the states over.
[00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.403]  We need to remove the electronic voting machines.
[00:07:11.683 --> 00:07:16.584]  First we've got to discredit the electronic voting machines and educate folks they're a fraud.
[00:07:16.884 --> 00:07:19.705]  It all first comes with knowledge.
[00:07:19.965 --> 00:07:25.707]  It's like if your engine's blown and you want to go fix the engine but you don't know how to fix it, you've got to learn how to fix the engine first.
[00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:32.343]  And so, this is the crossroads we're at.
[00:07:32.363 --> 00:07:35.447]  This is a very important time in history right now.
[00:07:36.528 --> 00:07:44.458]  And look at how I've been beating the drum for 13 plus years about the police state and the New World Order and the FEMA camps and the troops trying to take your guns.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.042]  And people laughed at me and it was a big joke.
[00:07:48.182 --> 00:07:48.743]  I didn't care.
[00:07:49.304 --> 00:07:50.726]  I knew they were preparing for it.
[00:07:50.966 --> 00:07:51.767]  I had the documents.
[00:07:51.887 --> 00:07:52.648]  I showed them to people.
[00:07:52.948 --> 00:07:54.250]  We had the video of them training.
[00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:00.157]  And I knew that as it unfolded, I hoped we just had more time to back them off so we could wake people up.
[00:08:00.197 --> 00:08:01.119]  And we have done that now.
[00:08:02.423 --> 00:08:12.731]  And now I talk to my dad, I talk to my uncles, I talk to cousins, I talk to people all over the country and the world, and they say, Alex, the Japanese Parliament is watching your films and committee hearings.
[00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:15.113]  And we have Japanese Parliament members on, we've woken up.
[00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:18.955]  And Alex, members of the Italian Parliament are listening.
[00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:20.457]  And Russia is listening.
[00:08:21.137 --> 00:08:22.598]  And Germany is listening.
[00:08:22.638 --> 00:08:24.079]  And leaders in our government are listening.
[00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:30.064]  And I get generals and admirals calling me up, retired, and colonels, and special forces people, and they know.
[00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:33.107]  And they're like, how did you know?
[00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:34.608]  And I'm just, I ran right into it.
[00:08:34.628 --> 00:08:36.309]  There were urban warfare drills.
[00:08:36.369 --> 00:08:37.090]  I said, what are these?
[00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.531]  I found out it was a takeover plan.
[00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:39.832]  I started warning people.
[00:08:40.132 --> 00:08:40.832]  So what?
[00:08:40.952 --> 00:08:42.113]  I'm trying to save people.
[00:08:42.153 --> 00:08:42.914]  I'm trying to help people.
[00:08:43.154 --> 00:08:44.115]  I'm trying to save myself.
[00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:45.636]  It's symbiotic.
[00:08:45.996 --> 00:08:51.460]  If I don't help others find out the truth, if I don't make sure they're free, I don't have any future either.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.302]  See, the new world order teaches you how to be selfish.
[00:08:54.782 --> 00:08:57.144]  I don't care what's happened to my neighbors and others as long as I got mine.
[00:08:58.513 --> 00:09:01.856]  But then when they don't care about you, you get enslaved as well.
[00:09:02.336 --> 00:09:03.757]  See, it's a mutual defense.
[00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:10.503]  When we defend liberty, defend freedom, stand up against oppression, aren't cowed by the police state.
[00:09:10.603 --> 00:09:15.207]  When we analyze its architecture and expose it, then the people see it going into place.
[00:09:16.668 --> 00:09:19.310]  Just like we talk about Internet 2 five, six years ago.
[00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:20.271]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:09:20.732 --> 00:09:22.113]  Our credibility just went up again.
[00:09:22.193 --> 00:09:23.234]  Now people know it's true.
[00:09:23.494 --> 00:09:24.915]  They know Internet 2 is a takeover.
[00:09:24.975 --> 00:09:25.676]  They're fighting it.
[00:09:28.663 --> 00:09:30.223]  You know, people say, well, where's the martial law?
[00:09:30.343 --> 00:09:31.424]  Where's the police state, Alex?
[00:09:31.464 --> 00:09:33.324]  Well, Congress has been threatened with martial law.
[00:09:34.064 --> 00:09:37.705]  Fellow Reserve Bank governors have said they're not even allowed to know what's going on.
[00:09:37.725 --> 00:09:39.365]  They're under war powers in martial law.
[00:09:39.805 --> 00:09:41.086]  NORTHCOM is now in control.
[00:09:41.306 --> 00:09:42.946]  They're announcing they're going to put troops on the streets.
[00:09:43.286 --> 00:09:49.047]  That's another ratchet up in the police state, in the martial law grid, in the Richter scale.
[00:09:49.067 --> 00:09:56.469]  But because we exposed this so diligently for so long, now their rollout of this program isn't going to go as well.
[00:09:58.416 --> 00:10:17.443]  And the praise goes to those men and women out there who knew the truth, who checked out my info, who took action, who made copies of Police State 2, the takeover, Police State 3 total enslavement, Police State 2000, those of you that made copies of my radio shows, those of you that did it back on cassette tape 12-13 years ago,
[00:10:18.843 --> 00:10:29.970]  Those of you that spread the word and put my films on AXS TV, those of you that did that, you are wonderful and you're an example to us all of what other people need to be doing, not sitting there.
[00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.591]  A lot of people procrastinate.
[00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:37.154]  You know, I want to paint my house and I want to put some new eaves on it and fix the leaks, but they overanalyze for years.
[00:10:37.214 --> 00:10:38.215]  They plan it.
[00:10:38.295 --> 00:10:39.136]  They talk about it.
[00:10:39.576 --> 00:10:40.516]  Most people do this.
[00:10:40.917 --> 00:10:42.618]  We need people who are full of action.
[00:10:43.834 --> 00:10:46.036]  You know, Elvis said, a little less talk, a little more action.
[00:10:46.056 --> 00:10:46.896]  In fact, let's pull that up.
[00:10:46.916 --> 00:10:47.657]  Pull that up on YouTube.
[00:10:47.737 --> 00:10:49.818]  Elvis, a little less talk, a little more action.
[00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:52.981]  I want to play a clip of that later.
[00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:55.903]  A little less talk, a little more action.
[00:10:55.923 --> 00:11:03.068]  Now he's talking about something else with a woman, but we're using it in the connotation of resisting.
[00:11:04.468 --> 00:11:05.309]  And that's what we need.
[00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:07.411]  We need action, action, action.
[00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:08.692]  That's what this radio show is about.
[00:11:08.932 --> 00:11:10.913]  The websites, the films, the guests.
[00:11:11.334 --> 00:11:12.955]  A platform to bring others on.
[00:11:12.995 --> 00:11:13.656]  It's so wonderful.
[00:11:13.696 --> 00:11:16.858]  Our platform is just accelerating, getting bigger and bigger by the minute.
[00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:18.460]  That's why they're racing to shut down the web.
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.843]  And we're just one part of that, but a big part of that fight.
[00:11:21.863 --> 00:11:32.752]  And it's all of us in symbiosis, in the symbiotic relationship, together, learning more, integrating information, expanding, growing.
[00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:42.287]  We're going to come back and talk to somebody who for I guess 15 plus years has been fighting the New World Order, the state's rights level.
[00:11:42.687 --> 00:11:50.294]  He was an aide to one of the state reps who introduced a bill that passed in Colorado back in 1994 for the states to say no to the federal takeover.
[00:11:50.654 --> 00:11:52.035]  We'll talk to him when we get back.
[00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:53.696]  Folks, there's a war on.
[00:11:54.457 --> 00:11:56.258]  Are you going to sign up to fight?
[00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:58.660]  And I want to commend all those that have been fighting.
[00:12:02.343 --> 00:12:04.305]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:12:04.915 --> 00:12:07.402]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:12:07.983 --> 00:12:12.155]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[00:12:12.904 --> 00:12:14.665]  You know that you need to prepare.
[00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:18.048]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:12:18.428 --> 00:12:21.411]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.

[00:12:59.837 --> 00:13:06.901]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:07.262 --> 00:13:08.963]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:13:09.898 --> 00:13:10.939]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:11.980]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.221]  This is his M.O.
[00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:14.543]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:14.563 --> 00:13:16.285]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:16.605 --> 00:13:23.372]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:23.752 --> 00:13:24.213]  Some U.S.
[00:13:24.253 --> 00:13:29.879]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:30.579 --> 00:13:34.060]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.241]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:14:00.495 --> 00:14:00.835]  Good day.
[00:14:01.036 --> 00:14:02.577]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:14:02.797 --> 00:14:03.097]  February 16, 2009.
[00:14:03.358 --> 00:14:04.699]  The overseas gold market is at $943.
[00:14:04.739 --> 00:14:08.242]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $970.02, $485.01 for the half-ounce, and $242.51 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:08.863]  That's $970.02, $485.01, and $242.51.
[00:14:19.907 --> 00:14:20.988]  We all want liberty.
[00:14:21.208 --> 00:14:22.409]  Some give their lives for it.
[00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.431]  A price that cannot be taken for granted.
[00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:26.713]  We forfeit bites and pieces of our freedom.
[00:14:26.834 --> 00:14:27.354]  For what?
[00:14:27.574 --> 00:14:38.905]  February 28th, Minnesota Campaign for Liberty will host Tom Woods, best-selling author of The Meltdown, Professor Butler, author of Trade on the Great Depression, and Bill Butler to cover monetary policy.
[00:14:39.105 --> 00:14:39.805]  We're good to go.
[00:15:00.655 --> 00:15:03.919]  What are you going to do if your family has no food in the event of an emergency?
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.124]  Do you really want to find out and gamble with your family's lives?
[00:15:07.344 --> 00:15:09.948]  Order a one-year supply that will feed four to five people for only $39.95.
[00:15:09.988 --> 00:15:13.512]  That's right, a one-year supply for under $4,000 from YourFoodStorage.com.

[00:15:29.891 --> 00:15:33.514]  Are taxes, food, energy, housing, medical, forcing Americans into poverty?
[00:15:33.655 --> 00:15:39.560]  Is free enterprise flawed or is our monetary system forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.122]  The answers are in Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:15:42.202 --> 00:15:45.665]  Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about the Fed and central banking.
[00:15:45.805 --> 00:15:46.647]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:15:46.667 --> 00:15:47.348]  I will give a U.S.
[00:15:47.368 --> 00:15:49.371]  Silver Dollar to everyone who purchases this book.
[00:15:49.451 --> 00:15:51.495]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:15:51.996 --> 00:15:53.819]  It's critical to be made aware of the system.
[00:15:53.919 --> 00:15:54.740]  Get your copy today.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:54.800]  800-686-2237.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.001]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:16:15.706 --> 00:16:44.705]  I'm gonna chase the sky forever With the woman and the stallion and the wind And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder Before we ever pass this way again And we're gonna ride
[00:16:46.215 --> 00:16:51.821]  JT Coyote is a Cherokee Choctaw.
[00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:25.070]  And he got involved back in 93 with Charles Duke, a representative out of El Paso County, Colorado, and he worked with him to help get the 1994 resolution passed in the 59th session of the Colorado State Legislature.
[00:17:25.751 --> 00:17:32.275]  In 94, our work also became a four-year fight for the Constitution began, and we've got the original
[00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:35.554]  Bill here and also some of his work.
[00:17:35.574 --> 00:17:39.397]  He does some great postings up at theprisonplanet.com forum.
[00:17:39.757 --> 00:17:48.785]  So I wanted to introduce him because Colorado, to my knowledge, was the first state to pass a 10th Amendment resolution saying, look, Feds, you can't be in here telling us what to do.
[00:17:49.285 --> 00:17:55.271]  And now we see 21 states and growing that are
[00:17:56.736 --> 00:18:01.758]  Saying no to FEMA camps, no to gun control, no to banning homeschool, no to forced conscription.
[00:18:02.258 --> 00:18:09.561]  So this is one of the biggest, strongest solutions we've got, but it's up to you, the people, to get these bills introduced in your legislature.
[00:18:09.581 --> 00:18:09.981]  How do you do that?
[00:18:10.001 --> 00:18:14.543]  You get copies that you like from other states, read over them, do some research, we have them all listed.
[00:18:15.737 --> 00:18:20.924]  At Infowars.com we've had now over the last few weeks a whole bunch of state reps here on the air.
[00:18:20.984 --> 00:18:23.427]  I'm going on coast to coast to put the call out.
[00:18:24.067 --> 00:18:27.011]  We're doing that, but I wanted to get JT Coyote on with us.
[00:18:27.071 --> 00:18:28.012]  Sir, great to have you with us.
[00:18:28.595 --> 00:18:29.135]  Hey, Alex.
[00:18:29.536 --> 00:18:30.216]  Good to be on.
[00:18:30.256 --> 00:18:31.097]  Thank you very much.
[00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:31.817]  You bet.
[00:18:31.837 --> 00:18:40.723]  This is a short segment, but introduce yourself, explain what happened in 94 that then got picked up in Oklahoma and California, and now we're seeing a massive resurgence of this.
[00:18:41.264 --> 00:18:41.664]  Okay.
[00:18:42.124 --> 00:18:49.089]  Well, I'm Cherokee Choctaw, but there's a smattering of German, French, and Irish in there too, Alex.
[00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:53.812]  So, and the name kind of stuck since I was a kid.
[00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.074]  So, you know, away we go.
[00:18:56.772 --> 00:19:25.722]  But in 1993, I was listening to a talk radio show, a local show here in Colorado, and a little-known senator named Charles Duke, or at that time he was a representative, came on the air and was discussing a method for eliminating federal mandates, which are these federal laws that come down and mandate the states to do certain things
[00:19:26.397 --> 00:19:32.099]  Funded or unfunded, and he had hit upon a Tenth Amendment resolution.
[00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:47.904]  And I heard this, and growing up in Colorado, you know, I'm a dairy farm boy, I got, you know, the Southern Baptist religion, the Constitution, and Bill of Rights, along with my morning pancakes in the morning before I went to school.
[00:19:48.704 --> 00:19:54.726]  So, I understood the essential truth about the Constitution, and that is that it is
[00:19:55.353 --> 00:19:57.813]  A contract between the states.
[00:19:58.794 --> 00:20:00.814]  It is not a contract with the federal government.
[00:20:00.874 --> 00:20:05.455]  The federal government was created by that contract.
[00:20:05.475 --> 00:20:05.775]  That's right.
[00:20:05.795 --> 00:20:06.295]  This is key.
[00:20:06.355 --> 00:20:13.696]  The states do a deal with themselves to constitute the federal government, and the minute it becomes destructive, they can dissolve it.
[00:20:14.156 --> 00:20:14.717]  Exactly.
[00:20:14.757 --> 00:20:16.377]  And that's what we're engaged in here.
[00:20:17.017 --> 00:20:18.477]  And it's marvelous to see.
[00:20:18.977 --> 00:20:19.577]  I had, in 1993,
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.704]  I called the Senator, or the Representative, see, that he became a Senator.
[00:20:28.864 --> 00:20:29.064]  Yes.
[00:20:29.084 --> 00:20:31.806]  Anyway, I called him on the air.
[00:20:32.747 --> 00:20:44.315]  It was November 11th, 1993, and I told him then I would do anything I could to help him because his plea for support is a lot like yours is.
[00:20:44.976 --> 00:20:51.100]  You know, it is heartfelt and it was right out of, you know, the urgent necessity
[00:20:51.607 --> 00:20:56.150]  That people realize that we cannot go this way alone.
[00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:56.510]  That's right.
[00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:01.453]  That was the first big explosion against the globalists, was Ruby Ridge and the torching of Waco.
[00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:07.956]  That's why they didn't bomb Oklahoma to then demonize patriots in 95, where they'd also pass similar things.
[00:21:08.537 --> 00:21:12.279]  So now here we are again with an even bigger explosion from the seeds you and others planted.
[00:21:12.844 --> 00:21:16.148]  Yeah, and the thing is, they had to do that.
[00:21:16.288 --> 00:21:20.013]  I mean, they needed something to obfuscate the fact that we were doing it.
[00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:29.305]  Patriot groups and lawful state militias too, Alex, were involved at the state level.
[00:21:30.533 --> 00:21:35.535]  Lawfully doing what the states are supposed to do, and the feds couldn't have that.
[00:21:36.075 --> 00:21:40.056]  And they blew up Oklahoma City, as sure as I'm talking to you.
[00:21:40.336 --> 00:21:41.597]  JT Coyote, stay there.
[00:21:41.617 --> 00:21:42.637]  We're going to come back to you.
[00:21:43.057 --> 00:21:44.918]  Break down the key history of this.
[00:21:44.938 --> 00:21:45.418]  Stay with us.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.580]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.661]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.581 --> 00:21:57.262]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.642]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:22:03.802 --> 00:22:09.045]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:22:09.325 --> 00:22:14.688]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:16.169]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:25.435]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:22:25.835 --> 00:22:27.476]  Now, compare a Cal Bend Pure Soap.

[00:23:00.501 --> 00:23:02.543]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:23:02.683 --> 00:23:05.065]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:23:05.085 --> 00:23:07.727]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:23:07.828 --> 00:23:08.908]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:08.949 --> 00:23:10.550]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.432]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:23:13.452 --> 00:23:17.656]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:23:17.676 --> 00:23:18.517]  Do you listen?
[00:23:26.798 --> 00:23:32.860]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.121]  An inside job?
[00:23:35.461 --> 00:23:37.042]  How dare you?
[00:23:37.922 --> 00:23:42.964]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:43.124 --> 00:23:45.305]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:50.253 --> 00:23:52.075]  Truth Rising.
[00:23:52.335 --> 00:23:54.897]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.

[00:24:00.962 --> 00:24:08.605]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[00:24:09.045 --> 00:24:10.205]  You need the Paclite!
[00:24:10.646 --> 00:24:18.488]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[00:24:18.868 --> 00:24:22.030]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.871]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:24:27.251 --> 00:24:28.532]  The Paclite is so durable,
[00:24:28.712 --> 00:24:28.812]  Yes!
[00:24:48.844 --> 00:24:50.386]  Or, call us today at 877-715-4448.
[00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:50.586]  That's 877-715-4448.
[00:25:15.009 --> 00:25:19.654]  We are back live going right back to our guest here in just a moment.
[00:25:20.675 --> 00:25:23.818]  This is a major chink in the Dragon's underbelly armor.
[00:25:26.229 --> 00:25:27.490]  People are going to say, well, it's too hard.
[00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.451]  How do we get the states to do it?
[00:25:28.471 --> 00:25:30.293]  20 plus are already moving to do it.
[00:25:30.693 --> 00:25:38.381]  Quite a few have passed it saying, look, it's illegal, Feds, for you to come in here and federalize everything and to tell us we can confiscate our guns and the rest of it.
[00:25:39.001 --> 00:25:41.103]  Wyoming is close to doing it.
[00:25:41.124 --> 00:25:47.610]  Also, Montana House measure would change gun rules, saying the Feds' laws don't apply there.
[00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:49.111]  It's like with marijuana laws.
[00:25:49.171 --> 00:25:50.372]  Even if you don't smoke marijuana,
[00:25:51.013 --> 00:25:56.496]  It has hundreds of medical uses, and they have these doctors prescribing it in California and, what is it, 14 other states.
[00:25:57.057 --> 00:26:01.379]  And the feds try to swoop down and block that, but they're failing in court over and over again.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.841]  So that's another victory for states' rights.
[00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:06.503]  Second Amendment, marijuana, it doesn't matter.
[00:26:06.543 --> 00:26:08.404]  So we're going to get to that in just a moment.
[00:26:08.704 --> 00:26:16.229]  Before I go any further, don't forget we have the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart at InfoWars.com with the new film out, Eye of the Phoenix.
[00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:19.692]  Part 3 in America's Secret Beginnings, the Dollar Bill.
[00:26:19.712 --> 00:26:27.842]  You want to understand the occultic nature of the New World Order from their own words, their own documents, their own statements, you need to get the Eye of the Phoenix discount at InfoWars.com.
[00:26:27.862 --> 00:26:33.710]  We've also got the new Obama t-shirts out where it says, Worst President Ever next to George Bush's face.
[00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.031]  It's half of George Bush's face.
[00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:36.173]  In fact, let's pull that up.
[00:26:37.609 --> 00:26:41.674]  Half of it's towards Bush's face and it says, until now, and it shows Obama's face.
[00:26:41.694 --> 00:26:44.136]  So it's half Bush's face, half Obama's face.
[00:26:44.356 --> 00:26:47.560]  That's a great way to strike up conversations and educate people.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.543]  On the back it says, don't be a sucker, InfoWars.com.
[00:26:50.563 --> 00:26:53.986]  So those available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:26:54.006 --> 00:26:55.388]  It's the don't be a sucker shirt.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:07.292]  Now, continuing here with our sponsors that make this transmission possible.
[00:27:08.698 --> 00:27:12.501]  eFoods Direct, ladies and gentlemen, is the best storable foods company out there.

[00:27:21.528 --> 00:27:22.609]  All high quality.
[00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:27.473]  And they have a little tester kit, a three-day food supply for one person for $21.
[00:27:28.033 --> 00:27:29.495]  That's the first responder kit.
[00:27:29.535 --> 00:27:33.338]  I would get that as a test sample, but I wouldn't wait long with all this craziness going on.
[00:27:33.958 --> 00:27:36.020]  Guns, gold, Second Amendment,
[00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.011]  Food, you need to be self-sufficient.
[00:27:39.031 --> 00:27:40.032]  That's so important.

[00:27:57.223 --> 00:27:58.784]  Okay, going back to JT Coyote.
[00:27:59.304 --> 00:28:08.932]  JT, break down the history of the states, the basics, how you were able to do this, you and just some volunteers and the state rep in Colorado and how that was the model.
[00:28:09.373 --> 00:28:18.420]  Now, it passed in Colorado, Colorado still violates its own law doing what they do, but the point is it's there and that idea was then picked up by other states
[00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:31.712]  Then it went dormant and now it's ten times, twenty times bigger than it ever was before and growing very, very quickly right now and how successful it will be will count on the people.
[00:28:31.752 --> 00:28:32.392]  Please continue.
[00:28:32.812 --> 00:28:36.473]  Well, you have to understand the time frame.
[00:28:36.833 --> 00:28:46.615]  We were just coming off of the heels of Ruby Ridge and it was obvious to most of the people in the community, in the Patriot community, that
[00:28:47.594 --> 00:28:51.517]  You know, this was a pretense for something bigger.
[00:28:52.397 --> 00:29:15.972]  And then, you know, the whole thing with the World Trade Center bombing, the first one that killed 12 people and injured dozens, when it failed, they had something set up in the media already, and the BATF went into the church in Waco, and the 51-day siege started, which took everybody's eyes.
[00:29:16.698 --> 00:29:17.999]  Off of the World Trade Center.
[00:29:18.979 --> 00:29:22.581]  Now, you know, we can do some interesting things with that.
[00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:34.366]  But the point is that Representative Duke, being from Arkansas, knew that Bill Clinton would make George Bush look like a piker.
[00:29:35.327 --> 00:29:40.309]  And he understood what kind of problem the country would have.
[00:29:40.925 --> 00:29:48.231]  Given Clinton's policies in Arkansas, all those years he was governor, I mean, he turned it into the poorest state in the union.
[00:29:48.771 --> 00:29:57.998]  So, Charlie was coming into work in the fall of 93, and, you know, said a little prayer, and it came to him.
[00:29:58.939 --> 00:30:01.761]  The Tenth Amendment was the way to go, and then he went on the air.
[00:30:02.222 --> 00:30:04.664]  I told him, hey, dude, I'm ready, let's do this.
[00:30:08.027 --> 00:30:10.468]  January 1st, I was his only aid.
[00:30:10.488 --> 00:30:20.632]  He had no staff at that time, so I did everything, which means I set up his radio appearances, everything, answered questions from the press.
[00:30:21.172 --> 00:30:37.679]  We started with the local talk shows, and then it soon branched out, and in 1994, early 1994, about January, he was on coast-to-coast AM with Art Bell before Art Bell became a flying saucer nut.
[00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:40.704]  And then it really spread.
[00:30:42.065 --> 00:30:44.566]  By the time... Oh, and I'm about to be on tonight.
[00:30:44.966 --> 00:30:46.887]  Again, it's that Bush fire point.
[00:30:46.907 --> 00:30:48.548]  16 million people.
[00:30:50.109 --> 00:30:52.550]  What a responsibility I've got this evening being on there.
[00:30:53.671 --> 00:30:55.672]  But again, history repeats itself.
[00:30:55.692 --> 00:30:56.292]  Let's continue.
[00:30:56.913 --> 00:31:00.435]  And by that time, I mean, he was on Roger Fredenberg.
[00:31:00.515 --> 00:31:04.797]  He was on all the local shows in a period of less than
[00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:18.339]  Oh, from the time we started in session on the 1st of January until it was passed in the Colorado State House, Charlie was on probably 80 radio programs, both national and local.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.561]  And that was the way we did it.
[00:31:20.601 --> 00:31:21.702]  We didn't have the Internet.
[00:31:21.722 --> 00:31:23.183]  The Internet at that time in 1993-94
[00:31:25.385 --> 00:31:27.688]  Well, most of us didn't even own a computer.
[00:31:27.828 --> 00:31:31.932]  And that's why Bill Clinton came out and said, we've got to shut down talk radio, Limbaugh.
[00:31:32.393 --> 00:31:43.165]  When Limbaugh is an establishment frontman to neutralize conservatives, they're actually worried about the regional syndicated shows and the local shows where the truth was getting out at the time and they wrote government memos.
[00:31:45.367 --> 00:31:46.228]  Hillary's back.
[00:31:46.908 --> 00:31:47.989]  Barack Obama's back.
[00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:49.249]  All these Senators are back.
[00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:55.973]  Bill Clinton said they want to shut down talk radio again, where you can't have your political opinion.
[00:31:56.013 --> 00:31:57.974]  Just amazing, because they're still worried about it.
[00:31:58.214 --> 00:31:59.875]  Same group of scoundrels, Alex.
[00:32:00.756 --> 00:32:01.316]  Same group.
[00:32:02.076 --> 00:32:07.079]  And they knew they had to do something, because it was growing that quickly.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.182]  By the time Oklahoma City went up on April 19, 1995,
[00:32:15.242 --> 00:32:21.625]  The 10th Amendment resolution had already been introduced in 47 state legislatures.
[00:32:22.566 --> 00:32:25.367]  And you didn't hear a word about it on the media.
[00:32:25.387 --> 00:32:26.728]  The media wouldn't even touch it.
[00:32:27.308 --> 00:32:30.410]  But the alternative media was moving like mad.
[00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:39.414]  Local radio talk shows, the fax network between them, KNUS knew what WOAI was doing, and everybody.
[00:32:42.362 --> 00:32:49.064]  Across the nation, it was kind of the precursor to the internet, using talk radio.
[00:32:49.144 --> 00:32:50.764]  And the militia movement exploded.
[00:32:50.784 --> 00:32:51.865]  People found out that U.N.
[00:32:51.885 --> 00:32:52.865]  treaties had been signed.
[00:32:53.185 --> 00:32:56.626]  Bill Clinton went on MTV and said, we are going to have gun confiscation.
[00:32:56.986 --> 00:32:59.807]  Janet Reno said, first we want to register, then we want to confiscate.
[00:33:00.127 --> 00:33:08.449]  They were on record, just like Attorney General Holder, who was the deputy then Attorney General, just like all these guys that are in there now are on record for total gun bans.
[00:33:08.609 --> 00:33:08.749]  Exactly.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:09.549]  The same thing.
[00:33:09.589 --> 00:33:10.990]  The people are getting wise.
[00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:29.494]  Will the Feds stage a false flag to try to, oh, see, the Feds are good, somebody attacked them, the American people are bad, it's American Al-Qaeda, they're secretly training police and military, that right now, or will we back them off from staging a terror attack because we've exposed false flag terror?
[00:33:29.854 --> 00:33:30.335]  Exactly.
[00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:33.315]  And, you know, it's curious.
[00:33:33.795 --> 00:33:35.596]  Even back then, we had problems.
[00:33:35.996 --> 00:33:39.258]  Kind of like what they had in New Hampshire recently.
[00:33:39.558 --> 00:33:41.680]  That won't stop Itsy and the boys.
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.081]  They'll go back at it again, just like we did.
[00:33:44.542 --> 00:33:47.484]  We had defeats, but we also had major victories.
[00:33:48.344 --> 00:33:55.028]  And right now, there are 15 states that have it already on their books.
[00:33:55.989 --> 00:33:58.831]  Trying to find them on the internet is a little difficult sometimes.
[00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:03.454]  But I have that thread running, which is
[00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:11.456]  uh... the on on the radio show page on at the prison planet form and i would be remiss if i didn't
[00:34:12.074 --> 00:34:21.160]  Say hello to all my friends over at the Prison Planet Forum, probably the greatest bunch of researchers that the InfoWars ever put together in one spot.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:36.090]  Yeah, your handle is JTCoyote, and your avatar is William Travis, Colonel William Travis, remember the Alamo, and it says our Tenth Amendment Sovereignty Resolve will defeat the New World Order.
[00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:44.855]  And it says, the law is clear, the feds are in breach of contract, the law is quite clear, and you've done great research here, a lengthy post.
[00:34:45.355 --> 00:34:58.063]  I'm going to get Kurt Nimmo in the states' rights section, he's building for the show tonight on Coast to Coast, to take the key areas out of this page and get that posted as a link as well, as a resource.
[00:34:58.083 --> 00:35:01.525]  Let's go over the states that already have this on the books.
[00:35:01.786 --> 00:35:03.887]  Okay, Colorado was first.
[00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:06.470]  Then, believe it or not, Hawaii.
[00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:10.231]  Hawaii came in right after Colorado did.
[00:35:10.331 --> 00:35:11.172]  Then Missouri.
[00:35:11.832 --> 00:35:12.612]  Missouri has it.
[00:35:13.532 --> 00:35:14.772]  Passed in both houses.
[00:35:15.793 --> 00:35:25.935]  And copies sent to the President, the Senate, Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate.
[00:35:26.415 --> 00:35:29.436]  I mean, all of these, they are on the books.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.922]  Uh, California was, uh, finally passed it in August of 94.
[00:35:33.962 --> 00:35:36.064]  Pennsylvania.
[00:35:36.824 --> 00:35:37.284]  Michigan.
[00:35:38.225 --> 00:35:38.865]  Montana.
[00:35:39.706 --> 00:35:40.086]  Arkansas.
[00:35:40.106 --> 00:35:41.387]  Hold on, I'm writing these down.
[00:35:41.727 --> 00:35:45.169]  Colorado, Hawaii, Missouri, California, Pennsylvania.
[00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:46.350]  Michigan.
[00:35:48.071 --> 00:35:48.672]  Montana.
[00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:50.973]  Arkansas.
[00:35:52.414 --> 00:35:52.934]  Idaho.
[00:35:54.475 --> 00:35:55.015]  Indiana.
[00:35:56.496 --> 00:35:57.417]  Big Alaska.
[00:35:58.558 --> 00:35:58.978]  Kansas.
[00:36:00.382 --> 00:36:00.942]  Alabama.
[00:36:02.262 --> 00:36:02.763]  Nevada.
[00:36:03.423 --> 00:36:04.383]  Okay, I lost count there.
[00:36:04.683 --> 00:36:05.163]  Colorado.
[00:36:05.183 --> 00:36:05.763]  Hawaii.
[00:36:06.203 --> 00:36:07.524]  You've got links to these up there.
[00:36:07.664 --> 00:36:08.164]  Missouri.
[00:36:08.704 --> 00:36:09.344]  California.
[00:36:09.364 --> 00:36:10.124]  Pennsylvania.
[00:36:10.524 --> 00:36:10.904]  Michigan.
[00:36:10.944 --> 00:36:11.485]  Montana.
[00:36:11.605 --> 00:36:12.305]  Arkansas.
[00:36:13.385 --> 00:36:13.865]  Idaho.
[00:36:15.185 --> 00:36:15.685]  Indiana.
[00:36:16.486 --> 00:36:17.206]  Alaska.
[00:36:17.226 --> 00:36:18.866]  Kansas.
[00:36:20.887 --> 00:36:21.467]  Alabama.
[00:36:23.007 --> 00:36:23.467]  Nevada.
[00:36:24.768 --> 00:36:25.468]  And Maine.
[00:36:26.348 --> 00:36:26.748]  And those
[00:36:27.723 --> 00:36:36.023]  As of 9-20 of 95, which was September 20th, 1995, had it passed through both houses of their legislature.
[00:36:36.667 --> 00:36:42.951]  And then the Feds bombed Oklahoma City to teach everybody to love them, and that's on record.
[00:36:43.672 --> 00:36:44.952]  Oh, aren't they good guys?
[00:36:44.972 --> 00:36:46.934]  We've got to stop these evil states' rights people.
[00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:50.076]  So that's why they were so concerned and carried that out.
[00:36:50.796 --> 00:36:52.437]  So you have 15 states already did it.
[00:36:52.537 --> 00:36:53.658]  Now there's 20.
[00:36:53.818 --> 00:36:58.121]  The 21st is Texas, but it just has the power to do it already on the books.
[00:36:58.141 --> 00:36:59.802]  So 20 that have introduced it.
[00:37:00.422 --> 00:37:08.048]  Again, but with stronger language about martial law, gun confiscation, forced draft, banning homeschooling, saying no to the feds.
[00:37:08.749 --> 00:37:10.410]  This is very, very exciting.
[00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:15.854]  How do we get these 15, where it's dormant, how do we get them to start enforcing this?
[00:37:16.355 --> 00:37:18.536]  This is also in that same thread.
[00:37:19.277 --> 00:37:21.619]  It's the very last post in that thread.
[00:37:21.679 --> 00:37:27.463]  It has to do with the 10th Amendment State Sovereignty Act.
[00:37:30.804 --> 00:37:53.359]  The whole idea behind the Sovereignty Resolution is to reaffirm and put the federal government on notice that the state understands that the federal government is a paper tiger created by the states, and that the federal government is on notice that the states are going to take their rights and utilize them.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:59.524]  Now, what happened with the guys in New Hampshire is they've got all this stuff in there.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:05.963]  That is, that should come in a later piece of legislation, in an act.
[00:38:06.623 --> 00:38:18.650]  Now the State Sovereignty Act, the first one that was implemented, or that was, well it wasn't implemented, which it was, it was introduced, was in Oklahoma by Charles Key.
[00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:20.531]  And that was in 1995.
[00:38:22.312 --> 00:38:26.654]  And it's, you can see it, you can read it, in the last post.
[00:38:27.595 --> 00:38:31.438]  of that thread there on the Prison Planet Forum.
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.363]  That's how the 15 states do it.
[00:38:37.183 --> 00:38:39.665]  And they can enumerate whatever they want in there.
[00:38:40.226 --> 00:38:54.458]  Because all powers that are not specifically delegated to the federal government by the Constitution or reserved to the states
[00:38:56.224 --> 00:38:59.228]  Are given to the people and the states respectfully.
[00:38:59.488 --> 00:39:01.330]  I want to stop you right there.
[00:39:02.409 --> 00:39:04.430]  Ron Paul was in the debates.
[00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:05.950]  He was all over national television.
[00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:10.412]  They tried to demonize him, but he exposed the private offshore banks, the scam they were running.
[00:39:10.792 --> 00:39:13.994]  Now he's bigger than ever, even though they stopped him from winning the nomination.
[00:39:14.594 --> 00:39:15.454]  That was a victory.
[00:39:15.754 --> 00:39:17.215]  Resistance is victory.
[00:39:17.575 --> 00:39:18.815]  Does it mean we win every battle?
[00:39:18.855 --> 00:39:23.517]  George Washington lost 90 plus percent of his battles, but they persevered.
[00:39:24.057 --> 00:39:24.798]  They continued.
[00:39:26.189 --> 00:39:31.216]  We have 15 states, 14 states that have already passed this, 20 states that have introduced it.
[00:39:31.236 --> 00:39:32.518]  Texas already has that power.
[00:39:33.058 --> 00:39:33.819]  So what's 21 and 14?
[00:39:36.383 --> 00:39:42.705]  Well, that should be about thirty-five.
[00:39:42.805 --> 00:39:45.786]  All we need is thirty-eight states, but they have to do it independently.
[00:39:46.106 --> 00:39:47.427]  Here's one of the rough things.
[00:39:48.227 --> 00:39:49.647]  The danger of a con-con.
[00:39:49.707 --> 00:39:55.489]  A con-con can get called and the feds can slip in what they want or stage a terror attack during it and rewrite everything.
[00:39:55.509 --> 00:40:03.572]  We have to have the states individually, as they were originally brought together under the union, they need to
[00:40:05.066 --> 00:40:07.428]  Well, I know you've written all this out, but I agree with it.
[00:40:07.768 --> 00:40:13.974]  They need to separately declare this, and then communicate with each other to direct orders at the Feds.
[00:40:13.994 --> 00:40:18.818]  There's no need to have a CONCON, because they're not changing the Constitution, they're only enforcing it.
[00:40:19.138 --> 00:40:20.119]  That's exactly correct.
[00:40:20.479 --> 00:40:32.169]  And the easiest way to look at it, it's kind of like, you know, there are 35 neighbors, and you've got a problem with, you know, the water board.
[00:40:32.935 --> 00:40:35.376]  Well, you know, you don't come together in a big meeting.
[00:40:35.977 --> 00:40:45.141]  You all communicate through phone because, you know, you all have to work during the day and setting up a meeting and all that is kind of rough.
[00:40:45.641 --> 00:40:48.483]  So you communicate by courier, the telephone.
[00:40:49.392 --> 00:40:54.315]  And then you all independently call the water department and say, fix the main.
[00:40:54.575 --> 00:40:59.897]  And then if you have to meet two weeks later at the meeting, you know, ten of you show up and yeah, this is what everybody wants.
[00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:01.258]  This happened in my neighborhood.
[00:41:01.298 --> 00:41:03.559]  The trash company went from two days a week to one day a week.
[00:41:03.899 --> 00:41:05.900]  They were cheating everybody on their water prices.
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.360]  Yeah.
[00:41:06.561 --> 00:41:09.422]  The neighborhood just got together and said, you're fired, we're hiring another company.
[00:41:09.802 --> 00:41:11.343]  And that's exactly what we're doing now.
[00:41:11.623 --> 00:41:13.284]  We need to take out the trash, Alex.
[00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:24.253]  Well, I mean, what happens when you have secret, unlimited power in government since 1947 with the National Security Act, 1913 before that, 1933 War Powers Act, all that?
[00:41:24.673 --> 00:41:27.176]  I mean, you're gonna get corruption and evil and out-of-control behavior.
[00:41:27.397 --> 00:41:30.661]  And so now, these bankers have all built offshore palaces.
[00:41:30.961 --> 00:41:33.524]  They're destroying the country, stealing everything.
[00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:42.210]  You know, the public is so angry now, I'm going to tell the feds, blowing up a few federal buildings isn't going to get people to feel sorry for you and love you and believe the people are the enemy.
[00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.791]  Folks, know you're a pack of criminals.
[00:41:43.951 --> 00:41:49.534]  And to the listeners, to dream is destiny, and action is victory, as I've said.
[00:41:50.134 --> 00:41:52.015]  It is up to you whether this is going to happen.
[00:41:52.035 --> 00:41:53.276]  Are you going to expose the bankers?
[00:41:53.516 --> 00:41:54.717]  Are you going to expose the New World Order?
[00:41:54.737 --> 00:41:56.458]  Are you going to literally scream from the rooftops?
[00:41:56.478 --> 00:41:58.300]  Are you going to do banner hangs?
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:19.854]  Are you going to do whatever it takes to get this buzz going and never stop organically so that as the feds get worse and worse, it may not pass now and the states may not act now, but they will down the road as this is educated and as the people know, the solution, the way out is dissolving the federal government through the states and then reconstituting it if the states so choose.
[00:42:20.214 --> 00:42:20.654]  Exactly.
[00:42:21.074 --> 00:42:23.615]  All government, all true government is local.
[00:42:24.236 --> 00:42:27.377]  And you move that direction.
[00:42:27.617 --> 00:42:35.499]  You don't worry so much about your state senator or representative to Congress in Washington.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:42.442]  You grab a hold of your local state legislator and you bend his ear hard.
[00:42:43.188 --> 00:42:46.370]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:50.974]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free, and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[00:43:12.881 --> 00:43:21.245]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[00:43:21.885 --> 00:43:29.328]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.
[00:43:29.828 --> 00:43:35.371]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[00:43:36.031 --> 00:43:40.793]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future
[00:43:41.212 --> 00:43:43.293]  And food will be your greatest asset.
[00:43:43.914 --> 00:43:46.196]  People spend money on all kinds of things.
[00:43:46.656 --> 00:43:50.739]  But our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[00:43:51.539 --> 00:43:52.560]  So don't delay.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.561]  Call today.
[00:43:53.581 --> 00:44:00.225]  908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you.
[00:44:00.245 --> 00:44:07.470]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:09.492]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:10.641 --> 00:44:11.502]  Who is the enemy?
[00:44:12.002 --> 00:44:12.502]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:12.803 --> 00:44:13.503]  This is his M.O.
[00:44:13.523 --> 00:44:15.104]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:15.144 --> 00:44:16.865]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:17.165 --> 00:44:23.910]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:24.750]  Some U.S.
[00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:30.454]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:31.134 --> 00:44:34.637]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:34.657 --> 00:44:44.885]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:44:45.125 --> 00:44:45.866]  Fabled enemies.
[00:44:46.346 --> 00:44:53.632]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:54.112 --> 00:44:57.455]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:01.107 --> 00:45:04.369]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:08.632]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:45:08.812 --> 00:45:20.240]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:30.927]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[00:45:31.247 --> 00:45:31.808]  I think so.
[00:46:05.393 --> 00:46:12.146]  Alright, I've got a bunch of news on the economy, on the police state coming up in the fourth and final hour here pretty quick.
[00:46:15.251 --> 00:46:28.440]  You know, you can always tell who the operatives are in the quote, liberty, awakening movement, whatever you want to call it, because they say, oh, you can't do anything at the state level, you can't do anything at the federal level, oh, there's nothing you can do, oh, 9-11 truth hasn't been effective, oh, well, well.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:35.985]  We've been incredibly effective to the point where they have congressional hearings talking about how we're bringing down their new world order.
[00:46:37.226 --> 00:46:41.449]  And we've done the work, we've exposed the world government's architecture, it's set up, it's system,
[00:46:42.682 --> 00:46:44.703]  And now the people have seen it all come true.
[00:46:45.223 --> 00:46:47.104]  Our credibility is at all-time highs.
[00:46:47.164 --> 00:46:49.605]  It is easier for you to wake people up than ever before.
[00:46:50.065 --> 00:46:54.187]  All they have to have is respect for themselves and to believe that they can affect change.
[00:46:54.227 --> 00:47:03.991]  The level of crime, the level of collapse, the level of destruction they're bringing to this nation, to then rebuild it as a criminal world government with total micromanagement of your daily lives is incredible.
[00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:08.893]  But there's all these scientists and doctors and one of the top former astronauts,
[00:47:09.773 --> 00:47:14.536]  He's now going public saying global warming is a fraud to tax you to control your money and your mind.
[00:47:14.996 --> 00:47:16.377]  People are rebelling against that.
[00:47:16.797 --> 00:47:20.439]  They're rebelling against the national ID, the animal ID, the premises ID.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:22.661]  And it's just going to get more intense.
[00:47:22.841 --> 00:47:23.801]  And we're not going to back off.
[00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:28.284]  And there's a lot of good people in government who are compartmentalized, who didn't know what they were part of.
[00:47:28.604 --> 00:47:29.625]  Now they're waking up.
[00:47:30.405 --> 00:47:34.969]  That's why the government's trying to hire criminals and felons and foreigners to make up the military and the CIA.
[00:47:35.289 --> 00:47:36.470]  That's not going to work either.
[00:47:37.311 --> 00:47:43.376]  We're going to win this thing, thanks to activists out there who was there when this whole Second American Revolution through the states started.
[00:47:43.896 --> 00:47:45.658]  And we just want to commend J.T.
[00:47:45.698 --> 00:47:47.379]  Coyote and the work he's doing.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:52.343]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com forum, his research, he has all the bills, all the stuff.
[00:47:52.664 --> 00:47:53.464]  He's done all the work.
[00:47:53.544 --> 00:47:54.565]  It's accurate.
[00:47:54.725 --> 00:47:55.966]  We've checked the bills ourselves.
[00:47:56.327 --> 00:47:57.027]  It's just amazing.
[00:47:57.047 --> 00:48:02.832]  What's the best way for them to find this particular data page on the Prison Planet forum?
[00:48:03.613 --> 00:48:08.717]  The easiest way to do it is to go to the main page, and that'll give you an index.
[00:48:08.817 --> 00:48:14.141]  Scroll about, oh, halfway down, and it'll say,
[00:48:16.092 --> 00:48:21.714]  The radio show page which is live show forum 11 a.m.
[00:48:21.854 --> 00:48:23.335]  to 3 p.m.
[00:48:23.415 --> 00:48:40.002]  CST and click on that and sticky in the very top of the the main discussion page there will be the subject our Tenth Amendment sovereignty resolved
[00:48:40.802 --> 00:48:42.562]  Will defeat the New World Order.
[00:48:42.822 --> 00:48:44.643]  Being a moderator, I do keep it clean.
[00:49:04.229 --> 00:49:04.890]  No, I know you.
[00:49:05.591 --> 00:49:05.972]  No, I know.
[00:49:05.992 --> 00:49:12.801]  I mean, they come in there, as you know, and try to say, kill this person, kill that person to get us shut down, but thank God they're not successful.
[00:49:13.222 --> 00:49:14.303]  No, listen.
[00:49:14.884 --> 00:49:19.290]  What people have to know is that all power resides in their hands.
[00:49:20.812 --> 00:49:27.215]  And if the 10th Amendment isn't enough, the 9th Amendment says the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights
[00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:51.110]  Shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
[00:49:51.450 --> 00:50:14.136]  That's right, and expanding on that, I'm going to hold you over another five minutes and we're going to go to calls and cover news, is that look how the globalists are creating illegitimate world bodies like the World Trade Organization, the IMF, the World Bank, the UN, and then they have our governments, our central governments that are illegitimate, sign agreements waiving our rights, waiving our liberties, getting rid of our system of checks and balances, our Magna Carta, our Constitution.
[00:50:14.756 --> 00:50:15.897]  Our Declaration of Independence.
[00:50:15.937 --> 00:50:16.877]  That's all treason.
[00:50:17.157 --> 00:50:18.198]  That's all fraud.
[00:50:18.498 --> 00:50:21.139]  The states are the legitimate body of the people.
[00:50:21.579 --> 00:50:22.460]  It is not our right.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:27.282]  It is our duty to overthrow anything that becomes destructive of those aims.
[00:50:27.762 --> 00:50:28.602]  And that's what we're doing now.
[00:50:28.662 --> 00:50:29.643]  We're trying peacefully.
[00:50:29.663 --> 00:50:37.006]  But they're coming with gun control, FEMA camps, mass financial implosion, by design to bankrupt us so we're on our knees.
[00:50:37.406 --> 00:50:38.027]  Fight back.
[00:50:38.107 --> 00:50:38.687]  Stay with us.
[00:50:42.233 --> 00:50:44.334]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:50.436 --> 00:50:51.016]  Hello, friends.
[00:50:51.056 --> 00:50:52.016]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:50:52.137 --> 00:50:56.698]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:50:56.858 --> 00:50:59.619]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:50:59.839 --> 00:51:02.700]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:07.582]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:51:07.822 --> 00:51:08.742]  If you simply prepare.
[00:51:08.942 --> 00:51:11.884]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:51:12.184 --> 00:51:19.087]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:51:19.207 --> 00:51:22.308]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:51:22.448 --> 00:51:22.708]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:51:25.129 --> 00:51:27.370]  Or, on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:51:39.015 --> 00:51:39.575]  Take action today.
[00:51:39.615 --> 00:51:41.396]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:51:53.149 --> 00:51:55.070]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:55.551 --> 00:51:58.313]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:14.705 --> 00:52:15.766]  We are back live!
[00:52:15.786 --> 00:52:19.908]  You're listening on the AM and FM dial, Global Shortwave, the Internet Satellite.
[00:52:20.008 --> 00:52:23.970]  This show will re-air consecutively at 3 o'clock today, then we're back live tomorrow.
[00:52:24.511 --> 00:52:27.032]  Tell your friends, your family, your neighbors to tune in to the streams.
[00:52:27.172 --> 00:52:33.136]  Pretty much everybody's got a computer, 75% of the population actually, and growing by a few percentage points every few months.
[00:52:34.389 --> 00:52:42.792]  Also, the first time I ever went on Coast to Coast AM on the internet graphs, our own internal ones, and Alexa and others, was the most visits we ever got.
[00:52:42.812 --> 00:52:43.913]  If you look at our graph,
[00:53:03.629 --> 00:53:12.291]  From 2002, you know, when they started taking these graphs, it just goes up towards 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, it's going straight up.
[00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:25.454]  But even though our graph's going straight up to millions of visitors every day, there's still that spike, the first time I went on Coast to Coast AM in 2003, that it's still that two-day spike, almost as high as our daily spike.
[00:53:26.769 --> 00:53:34.094]  And that was because people were so excited to hear I was going on Coast to Coast AM for the first time, that they spread the word about it, and people even outside that audience tuned in.
[00:53:34.474 --> 00:53:39.377]  No matter where you are, Coast to Coast AM is on several AMs you can hear in your town.
[00:53:39.738 --> 00:53:44.701]  So your mom, your dad, your neighbors, your friends, tell them, tune in tonight to that show.
[00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:47.243]  I'm going to be on there for three hours, breaking this down.
[00:53:47.283 --> 00:53:48.944]  I've got all the documentation, all the info.
[00:53:49.525 --> 00:53:55.377]  In closing with our guest, and we really appreciate him joining us, J.T.
[00:53:55.417 --> 00:53:58.683]  Coyote, activist who helped get all this going in Colorado back in 93-94.
[00:54:01.482 --> 00:54:15.519]  We need the states to boldly also come out, as New Hampshire and others are doing, and saying, look, we know the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and PDD 51 declare the Federal Congress ceremonial that the President's a dictator, his office in the National Security Council.
[00:54:15.939 --> 00:54:18.642]  We know the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and now public
[00:54:19.483 --> 00:54:24.431]  Pentagon announcements say the governors and the legislature serve at the pleasure of the president.
[00:54:24.871 --> 00:54:25.853]  That's what Lincoln said.
[00:54:25.893 --> 00:54:30.800]  He arrested hundreds of members of Congress, newspaper editors, put people in jail, executed people.
[00:54:31.521 --> 00:54:33.124]  Even the North didn't want the war.
[00:54:35.467 --> 00:54:36.148]  That day and age.
[00:54:36.168 --> 00:54:36.808]  This is now.
[00:54:36.869 --> 00:54:37.910]  This is asinine.
[00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:41.072]  We need the states up front to say, by the way, don't try any funny business.
[00:54:41.573 --> 00:54:43.515]  We know you're a pack of crooks and illegitimate.
[00:54:43.535 --> 00:54:46.858]  We need this statement to be, the federal government's controlled by foreign banks.
[00:54:46.898 --> 00:54:50.181]  That's what Newsweek says, but they say it's good, and that it's a new world order.
[00:54:50.682 --> 00:54:52.804]  We say, we're dissolving you now.
[00:54:52.984 --> 00:54:54.986]  I mean, it's a pack of criminals up there.
[00:54:55.246 --> 00:55:00.251]  We have to be bold and get bold ideas out, or we'll just have a bunch of states pass this and the feds will
[00:55:00.751 --> 00:55:07.454]  Well, like Charles Key, the representative said, the state police come in and lobby and threaten and freak out every time the state is about to become sovereign.
[00:55:07.694 --> 00:55:12.956]  It's always been sovereign, but re-declare it, because they're really federal boys set up after the War Powers Act of 1933.
[00:55:13.317 --> 00:55:14.037]  Final comments?
[00:55:15.498 --> 00:55:17.499]  That's absolutely correct, all of those laws.
[00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:27.383]  You know, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, the Patriot Act I and II, all of them just showed power to the federal agent.
[00:55:28.295 --> 00:55:30.077]  At the expense of the states and the people.
[00:55:30.557 --> 00:55:43.689]  The thing that states have to realize is you want to keep the broad language and the resolution to where it covers the entire spectrum of what the 10th Amendment, 9th and 10th Amendments mean.
[00:55:43.709 --> 00:55:49.134]  Then you institute, like Charlie Key did back in 95, the State Sovereignty Act.
[00:55:53.422 --> 00:55:57.024]  And you get it passed while the people are still thinking about this stuff.
[00:55:57.724 --> 00:56:01.046]  And then now, the idea is introduced into their minds.
[00:56:01.086 --> 00:56:03.227]  This is part of educating the public.
[00:56:03.328 --> 00:56:05.229]  State's good guys, Fed's bad guys.
[00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.989]  That's it.
[00:56:06.409 --> 00:56:10.051]  And the bad guys aren't our federal government.
[00:56:10.111 --> 00:56:12.012]  They are an offshore banking cartel.
[00:56:12.533 --> 00:56:14.874]  They are the crowned heads of Europe.
[00:56:15.254 --> 00:56:22.058]  They are all of the enemies of the United States of America since we began.
[00:56:22.851 --> 00:56:27.881]  And they have figured out a way through corporate law to take over.
[00:56:28.863 --> 00:56:31.128]  I mean, that's a whole other program right there.
[00:56:32.942 --> 00:56:37.425]  The DC Organic Act of 1871... All of it.
[00:56:37.445 --> 00:56:42.248]  How do folks get in touch with you if they want to contact you outside the Prison Planet Forum, J.T.
[00:56:42.268 --> 00:56:42.628]  Coyote?
[00:56:43.129 --> 00:56:45.911]  Well, if they want to... Oh, Lord!
[00:56:46.831 --> 00:56:48.392]  Let me give you an email address, Alex.
[00:56:48.833 --> 00:56:49.113]  Okay.
[00:56:50.233 --> 00:56:58.699]  It's yotis, y-o-t-i-s, at cybox, c-y-b-o-x.
[00:56:59.059 --> 00:56:59.420]  Stay there.
[00:57:01.636 --> 00:57:02.856]  Hi, this is Steve Schenk.
[00:57:03.156 --> 00:57:04.297]  eFoods does it again.
[00:57:04.537 --> 00:57:09.318]  The 3-Day Responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy, delicious, easy-fix food.
[00:57:09.638 --> 00:57:17.780]  The price of the 3-Day Responder is almost ridiculous at $21.95 for actually 12 meals plus snacks.
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:25.941]  When you taste the food in the 3-Day Responder, you will understand why families trust eFoods Direct to provide healthy, delicious food for every need.
[00:57:26.341 --> 00:57:29.002]  Whether you're hunting, playing, or responding to an emergency,
[00:57:31.687 --> 00:57:32.167]  I think so.
[00:58:00.535 --> 00:58:06.920]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:07.281 --> 00:58:09.262]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:09.923 --> 00:58:10.963]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:11.484 --> 00:58:12.004]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:12.285 --> 00:58:13.165]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:13.185 --> 00:58:14.566]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:14.586 --> 00:58:16.388]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:16.628 --> 00:58:23.393]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:23.794 --> 00:58:24.234]  Some U.S.
[00:58:24.274 --> 00:58:29.939]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:30.599 --> 00:58:34.082]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:34.102 --> 00:58:37.144]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:10.097]  SouthSummit.com is the place for top name brand knives such as Kershaw, Spyderco, Cold Steel, Gerber, K-Bar, Boker, Leatherman, and more.

[00:59:47.397 --> 00:59:49.418]  S-U-M-M-I-T.
[00:59:49.638 --> 00:59:51.299]  SouthSummit.com.

[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:56.524]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:56.544 --> 00:59:58.085]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:17.034 --> 01:00:21.337]  Alright, we've got about 51 and a half minutes left in Transnichon.
[01:00:21.797 --> 01:00:23.498]  Ton of news and your phone calls to cover.
[01:00:23.938 --> 01:00:27.560]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.441]  Talking to activist J.T.
[01:00:29.481 --> 01:00:36.325]  Coyote, who helped get the first bill of this type passed in 1993-94 in Colorado.
[01:00:36.685 --> 01:00:40.868]  Now all these states declaring sovereignty, but as he pointed out, 14 states have already done it.
[01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:44.410]  They seem to empower themselves, and we need to make sure they do that.
[01:00:45.916 --> 01:00:47.416]  The mainstream media is not going to do this for us.
[01:00:47.536 --> 01:00:48.416]  We have to do it.
[01:00:48.456 --> 01:00:50.057]  But the people are angry, they're upset.
[01:00:50.077 --> 01:01:00.619]  The globalists are using the crisis they created to stampede everybody into going along with their fix that is an open offshore bank that will rule the United States and control all our actions in other countries.
[01:01:00.999 --> 01:01:01.779]  A new world order.
[01:01:01.819 --> 01:01:02.919]  That was the Newsweek headline.
[01:01:03.319 --> 01:01:05.339]  They're announcing it everywhere as the solution.
[01:01:05.479 --> 01:01:06.680]  Oh, we just got an idea!
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.861]  The very bankers that engineered all this will save you by running everything and carbon taxing everything you do in your life.
[01:01:11.881 --> 01:01:12.441]  How's that sound?
[01:01:12.761 --> 01:01:13.821]  Oh, it sounds wonderful!
[01:01:15.188 --> 01:01:19.912]  JT Coyote, give your email address out for other talk show hosts and people that want to have you on.
[01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:29.621]  Okay, it's yotis, y-o-t-i-s, at cybox, c-y-b-o-x, dot com.
[01:01:30.342 --> 01:01:31.202]  And I have to say this.
[01:01:34.051 --> 01:01:35.492]  I've been researching this for years.
[01:01:35.512 --> 01:01:40.434]  There's so many areas I have to research that I'm never as knowledgeable as particular experts like yourself.
[01:01:40.474 --> 01:01:41.534]  I've read over your material.
[01:01:41.974 --> 01:01:45.476]  I've read the other 20 bills that are introduced or passed that now 35 states
[01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:48.824]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:01:48.844 --> 01:01:52.167]  I want to let you know that the Travis family thanks you for what your family did.
[01:02:14.445 --> 01:02:15.305]  Well, thank you, my friend.
[01:02:15.345 --> 01:02:16.166]  I appreciate that.
[01:02:16.246 --> 01:02:16.826]  God bless you.
[01:02:17.526 --> 01:02:20.947]  You know, we are in this together, folks, all of us.
[01:02:21.647 --> 01:02:26.669]  And our families touch one another clear back to before the revolution.
[01:02:27.409 --> 01:02:32.611]  And, you know, I mean all of our families, we're all tied together as Americans.
[01:02:33.191 --> 01:02:35.131]  And these guys want to enslave us.
[01:02:36.072 --> 01:02:37.592]  They want to enslave the world.
[01:02:38.652 --> 01:02:43.654]  And they will make it look like sugar-coated candy for you, so you'll buy it.
[01:02:44.289 --> 01:02:44.929]  Don't buy it.
[01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:48.770]  Alex, it's been good talking with you, my friend.
[01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:50.591]  Well, God bless you.
[01:02:50.631 --> 01:02:51.291]  Take care, my friend.
[01:02:51.311 --> 01:02:53.451]  We'll talk to you soon as this unfolds and develops.
[01:02:54.712 --> 01:03:00.293]  Folks, it is up to all of you out there whether this is going to be successful or not, and this is not our only operation against the enemy.
[01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:10.296]  The overall info war is the overarching program, because by educating the public about the nature of the enemy, their criminal control, their fraudulent usurpation of our liberties and authority,
[01:03:11.414 --> 01:03:14.595]  By doing that, from being educated flows the freedom.
[01:03:15.055 --> 01:03:17.396]  Without that, you have despotism and bondage.
[01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:20.096]  So the ball is in your court.
[01:03:21.277 --> 01:03:30.379]  I want to go to your phone calls, and I did take about 10 calls earlier, but what I do is, each caller brings up so many great points, or I want to get off Prozac, what should I do?
[01:03:30.399 --> 01:03:33.420]  And then I've got to go through a whole medical thing about it.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:34.740]  Thank you.
[01:03:53.803 --> 01:03:57.927]  Ted, again, ran out of the gold at the $8.30 level that he was selling when it was $9.25.
[01:03:59.028 --> 01:04:02.711]  He ran out of that deal, but he has the next best thing, and it's only going up from here.
[01:04:02.771 --> 01:04:04.813]  The evidence points in that direction.
[01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:14.621]  With all the paper being devalued, the stock market continuing to plunge, ladies and gentlemen, you need to get into gold and silver, and Ted is almost run out of gold he bought at the $8.65, $8.70 level.
[01:04:14.641 --> 01:04:16.002]  So we're talking about $40 and $30.
[01:04:16.643 --> 01:04:17.143]  We're talking about
[01:04:21.581 --> 01:04:28.346]  You know, $80, $75, $80 difference here in the price of gold that Ted has.
[01:04:28.386 --> 01:04:29.487]  He got it at that discount.
[01:04:29.507 --> 01:04:33.169]  He's passing it on to you, but he told me this morning, that's almost gone again.
[01:04:33.449 --> 01:04:35.351]  And then you'll pay more down the road, and I guess happily.
[01:04:35.691 --> 01:04:38.032]  The point is, this is a deal that cannot be beaten.
[01:04:38.373 --> 01:04:39.433]  Ted, what's going on?
[01:04:39.874 --> 01:04:42.515]  Well, I mean, you're just about right on the nail.
[01:04:42.575 --> 01:04:44.517]  I mean, you hit the nail on the head with that.
[01:04:45.717 --> 01:04:48.099]  The supply of gold out there is so tight.
[01:04:48.179 --> 01:04:50.180]  I mean, I'm out there trying to buy this and that.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:54.183]  I get real small increments from... Almost everybody else is sold out, Ted.
[01:04:54.203 --> 01:04:59.046]  I mean, you've been the leader because you've been able to keep it because you've been in business 30 years and have the connections.
[01:04:59.326 --> 01:05:03.369]  Well, it is nice to have the connections, and even though I do, it's very difficult.
[01:05:03.409 --> 01:05:04.690]  We do a lot of importing.
[01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:13.356]  I'm really surprised how many British sovereigns I take in from Europe, and then people from Britain call up and want to buy them back from me, and I ship them right back to them.
[01:05:13.416 --> 01:05:14.997]  I mean, it's just how that
[01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:16.761]  That whole process is going.
[01:05:16.801 --> 01:05:22.069]  I mean, we're selling more gold now on the weekends than we were for an entire month just a couple years ago.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.302]  That's just a comparison of what's going on.
[01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:28.624]  I know every dealer across the United States is dealing with the same thing.
[01:05:29.464 --> 01:05:31.766]  There is a huge shortage out there.
[01:05:31.786 --> 01:05:41.233]  Folks, if you Google gold sold out or gold dealers sold out, most places say we're sold out or you can only buy one coin and there's like a 40% markup.
[01:05:41.513 --> 01:05:44.956]  You're getting this below what it should even be sold for.
[01:05:45.076 --> 01:05:45.976]  Forget markup.
[01:05:46.437 --> 01:05:46.837]  Yeah, I know.
[01:05:47.037 --> 01:05:50.099]  See, what I do is when gold dipped down below $900 an ounce here,
[01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:57.634]  About a week and a half, two weeks ago, it got down to about that $8.70 level and I said, I'm just going to buy as much as I can.
[01:05:58.114 --> 01:06:08.842]  So here I've got my buyers just out there talking to dealers and trying to find out what we can accumulate and, you know, fill our safes up or at least have it come in or lock us in at a price so I know where I can sell.
[01:06:09.502 --> 01:06:12.184]  That $8.70 level gold right now is available.
[01:06:12.564 --> 01:06:14.826]  We're offering the Franks at $2.17.
[01:06:14.926 --> 01:06:17.488]  Right now, currently, in today's market, they're at $2.35.
[01:06:18.108 --> 01:06:19.769]  I have the British Sovereign at $2.65.
[01:06:21.192 --> 01:06:22.112]  The current market is $2.88.
[01:06:23.073 --> 01:06:27.455]  Now, mind you, the Frank was at $2.02 here just a short while ago that I was selling them at.
[01:06:27.715 --> 01:06:33.438]  Now they're at $2.17 that I'm selling them for, and people that have bought them at $2.02 can sell them back at a nice little profit.
[01:06:33.798 --> 01:06:35.439]  And that's just the way that it's been going.
[01:06:35.799 --> 01:06:42.162]  Now, the silver coins, I still have Walking Liberty halves, and I also have the Mercury Dimes.
[01:06:42.342 --> 01:06:48.165]  And both of those are trading at a price, back when gold was trading between $9 and $10 an ounce, I'm sorry, silver.
[01:06:48.627 --> 01:06:49.788]  Nine and ten dollars an ounce.
[01:06:49.888 --> 01:06:54.211]  I was able to pick up quite a few of these bags of halves and dimes.
[01:06:54.531 --> 01:06:57.954]  And I'm still selling them at the exact same price as I was back then.
[01:06:58.493 --> 01:07:03.416]  Silver, however, at now, at this time, has almost seen $14 an ounce.
[01:07:03.476 --> 01:07:07.919]  So that's up a tremendous amount from where it was, and that is just a steal.
[01:07:07.939 --> 01:07:14.662]  And that's because the banks have announced that they are fully going to blow out the currency with tens of trillions of dollars.
[01:07:14.702 --> 01:07:16.243]  This is unbelievable.
[01:07:16.564 --> 01:07:22.227]  The hyperinflation alone is going to be devastating, but we're going to have a real economy depression on top of it.
[01:07:22.687 --> 01:07:23.548]  That's right, Alex.
[01:07:23.608 --> 01:07:25.329]  Every time you see this bailout, I mean, this $800
[01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:30.974]  This $800 billion bailout by Barack Obama is not going to be good for the U.S.
[01:07:31.034 --> 01:07:31.435]  dollar.
[01:07:31.755 --> 01:07:38.403]  Bloomberg reports that it's mandated, so it's a four-year plan, so it's actually four times that.
[01:07:39.062 --> 01:07:42.423]  Yep, so here's what the thing is, and then there's a bank bailout right behind it.
[01:07:42.463 --> 01:07:46.404]  They're trying to push another bank bailout like we had when George Bush was in office.
[01:07:46.424 --> 01:07:48.845]  Well, that's world leaders all meeting for Bretton Woods 3.
[01:07:48.885 --> 01:07:55.686]  They had Bretton Woods 2 three months ago to openly set up the New World Superbank to set the currencies and control them.
[01:07:56.127 --> 01:07:57.807]  Oh my, I mean, it's all happening, Ted.
[01:07:58.147 --> 01:07:58.627]  Oh, it is.
[01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:04.769]  And as soon as you start to see a world tax, and it's probably going to come in the form of a carbon tax,
[01:08:05.461 --> 01:08:08.262]  You know that the sovereignty of this nation is ended.
[01:08:08.462 --> 01:08:08.942]  Well, no, no.
[01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:16.445]  The Senate has said it's going to be hundreds of new taxes under carbon to fund the new loans from the private banks.
[01:08:16.505 --> 01:08:24.508]  So when we hear about bailing them out, we're actually borrowing money from the private central banks to give it back to them to then be loaned back to the government.
[01:08:24.528 --> 01:08:25.909]  I know that sounds crazy because it is.
[01:08:25.949 --> 01:08:26.789]  It's so fraudulent.
[01:08:27.049 --> 01:08:28.190]  But I want to explain something to people.
[01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:30.831]  You're going to hear this as a new trillion dollar bailout.
[01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:37.516]  But the last bailout was unlimited trillions and no review is allowed of it under the bill.
[01:08:37.556 --> 01:08:38.617]  So why do they need a new bailout?
[01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:45.342]  The new bailout, if you read the Financial Times of London and others, they will admit it is the new world banking structure to quote, knock heads.
[01:08:45.782 --> 01:08:46.783]  So this is it.
[01:08:46.863 --> 01:08:48.384]  So people will hear it's a bailout.
[01:08:48.745 --> 01:08:49.565]  It's not even that.
[01:08:49.645 --> 01:08:50.366]  It's a takeover.
[01:08:50.986 --> 01:08:51.887]  It sure is, Alex.
[01:08:51.947 --> 01:08:57.712]  The sovereignty of the United States of America is what's being held in the balance here.
[01:08:57.872 --> 01:09:00.594]  Everybody should be getting on their feet
[01:09:01.112 --> 01:09:02.252]  And becoming activists.
[01:09:02.312 --> 01:09:04.893]  There should be nobody left back behind on this.
[01:09:05.333 --> 01:09:05.573]  Everybody.
[01:09:05.593 --> 01:09:13.675]  And that's why, that's why we, to save the Union, to save the Republic, the foreign bankers have seized control of the Feds.
[01:09:14.115 --> 01:09:15.255]  They're taking over the states.
[01:09:15.335 --> 01:09:18.996]  We have to take the states back and then reconstitute the Republic.
[01:09:19.016 --> 01:09:20.156]  I want to explain that here.
[01:09:20.437 --> 01:09:22.117]  We are saving the Union, Ted.
[01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:24.018]  There is no question about it.
[01:09:24.058 --> 01:09:28.201]  The only way you're going to save the union is to get us back to constitutional money.
[01:09:28.862 --> 01:09:38.088]  You are not going to have liberty while you have a central bank doling out and deciding whether or not we can have good or bad economic times.
[01:09:38.509 --> 01:09:40.290]  That should be judged upon the market.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:45.041]  And we shouldn't have to answer to any central bank at all.
[01:09:45.421 --> 01:09:48.122]  I mean, that was fought out back when the Constitution was passed.
[01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:48.542]  That's right.
[01:09:48.582 --> 01:09:52.484]  You give the bankers unlimited power and secrecy, they are going to rape you.
[01:09:52.824 --> 01:09:58.986]  I was reading a McClatchy newspaper headline about, you know, trust the bankers with the mess they created, trust them with unlimited funds.
[01:10:00.886 --> 01:10:01.526]  It's a stack of papers.
[01:10:01.546 --> 01:10:02.727]  I'm going to show it during the next segment.
[01:10:02.747 --> 01:10:06.048]  The point is, is that all of this is going on.
[01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:07.028]  All of this is happening.
[01:10:07.048 --> 01:10:08.188]  I'm going to come back and take calls.
[01:10:12.725 --> 01:10:13.526]  I don't need the stack now.
[01:10:13.606 --> 01:10:14.406]  I'll get it in a little while, guys.
[01:10:14.426 --> 01:10:16.148]  There's like three stacks out there and it won't be the right one.
[01:10:16.548 --> 01:10:21.472]  Ted, tell folks about the particular... I was doing research up here late last night.
[01:10:22.253 --> 01:10:23.914]  It's like a paper explosion in this office.
[01:10:24.575 --> 01:10:25.716]  It takes a lot of research, folks.
[01:10:25.736 --> 01:10:26.437]  You know what we know here.
[01:10:26.457 --> 01:10:27.417]  We're not just spouting off.
[01:10:28.719 --> 01:10:33.603]  Ted, tell folks about the coins you do have at that discounted rate and how long you can have them in the number.
[01:10:33.943 --> 01:10:34.203]  I do.
[01:10:34.323 --> 01:10:36.185]  I have the British Sovereigns.
[01:10:36.405 --> 01:10:37.186]  I have the Franks.
[01:10:37.246 --> 01:10:38.267]  They're both discounted.
[01:10:38.287 --> 01:10:40.929]  The Walking Liberty halves and the Mercury dimes.
[01:10:41.311 --> 01:10:46.453]  We have some old $20 and $10 gold pieces and a small supply of U.S.
[01:10:46.513 --> 01:10:46.833]  Eagles.
[01:10:47.253 --> 01:10:48.553]  What you want to do is give us a call at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:10:48.573 --> 01:10:51.394]  Again, that's 1-800-686-2237 and I suggest you get moving right away.
[01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.175]  If you have money in the stock market and the bank,
[01:11:02.682 --> 01:11:04.723]  In the, you know, annuities, wherever.
[01:11:04.823 --> 01:11:06.644]  All the paper investments are in trouble.
[01:11:07.005 --> 01:11:07.725]  Get away from that.
[01:11:07.765 --> 01:11:09.066]  Get into physical gold.
[01:11:09.086 --> 01:11:12.068]  Annuities aren't insured, but neither are your real bank accounts.
[01:11:12.308 --> 01:11:14.549]  They can claim the FDIC's gonna come in and save you.
[01:11:14.749 --> 01:11:17.171]  Yeah, they're gonna pay you back with fiat inflated dollars.
[01:11:17.671 --> 01:11:21.033]  That's exactly what'll happen, and they'll be lent to us from a central bank.
[01:11:21.173 --> 01:11:23.795]  To make things worse, we'll be going under the hook with
[01:11:24.417 --> 01:11:27.320]  With more taxes, and we'll have to service more debt.
[01:11:27.621 --> 01:11:33.367]  Ted, the brokers are going to be there until midnight tonight.
[01:11:33.387 --> 01:11:33.668]  800-686-2237.
[01:11:33.688 --> 01:11:33.728]  800-686-2237.
[01:11:33.888 --> 01:11:37.452]  If you call past midnight, the deal goes over.
[01:11:37.492 --> 01:11:37.833]  Right, Ted?
[01:11:37.853 --> 01:11:38.694]  You'll call them back tomorrow?
[01:11:38.954 --> 01:11:39.515]  We sure will.
[01:11:39.923 --> 01:11:40.163]  800-686-2237.
[01:11:40.243 --> 01:11:43.905]  Now, you'll pay more if you don't tell them.
[01:11:44.165 --> 01:11:46.566]  It's the Ted Anderson Alex Jones Show special.
[01:11:46.586 --> 01:11:46.826]  800-686-2237.
[01:11:47.006 --> 01:11:50.928]  I tell you, Ted, I don't like being right.
[01:11:50.988 --> 01:11:52.268]  I don't like the fact we've been proven right.
[01:11:52.288 --> 01:11:53.389]  This is horrible, what's happening.
[01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:55.029]  I just hope folks protect themselves.
[01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:55.850]  Thanks for talking to us.
[01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:57.350]  Yeah, thanks for having me on.
[01:11:57.370 --> 01:12:00.112]  Stay with us, we'll be right back after this break.
[01:12:00.912 --> 01:12:06.354]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:12:06.634 --> 01:12:07.875]  And we knew what to do.
[01:12:08.677 --> 01:12:09.718]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:12:09.939 --> 01:12:16.367]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:12:16.967 --> 01:12:25.518]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:12:25.885 --> 01:12:32.667]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:12:32.967 --> 01:12:36.029]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:41.370]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:12:41.911 --> 01:12:44.551]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:12:44.992 --> 01:12:51.774]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:12:54.735 --> 01:12:54.975]  I don't know.

[01:14:00.862 --> 01:14:04.245]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:14:04.385 --> 01:14:09.589]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:14:09.789 --> 01:14:14.573]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.

[01:16:39.097 --> 01:16:40.538]  The Dirty Secret of the Bailout.
[01:16:40.718 --> 01:16:41.759]  32 words to utter.
[01:16:41.999 --> 01:16:42.980]  See, they don't need a new bailout.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.681]  They have unlimited criminal power here.
[01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:50.346]  But when you read the section... Oh, I didn't grab...
[01:16:51.758 --> 01:16:52.719]  No, I did grab page two.
[01:16:52.739 --> 01:16:54.139]  Let me find the text of the bailout here.
[01:16:54.159 --> 01:16:56.841]  I'm trying to find the actual page.
[01:16:57.401 --> 01:17:00.622]  I printed this last night to find the page where it quoted the bailout.
[01:17:03.784 --> 01:17:05.025]  Well, I tell you, Murphy's Law.
[01:17:05.645 --> 01:17:06.825]  That one page it didn't print.
[01:17:08.206 --> 01:17:11.708]  We're at states no one can review it, no one can look at it, nobody can investigate it.
[01:17:12.268 --> 01:17:14.169]  Let's go to Jurien in the Netherlands.
[01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:15.150]  Jurien, you're on the air.
[01:17:15.190 --> 01:17:15.570]  Go ahead.
[01:17:17.403 --> 01:17:19.624]  Hi, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:17:20.524 --> 01:17:31.769]  I would like to say you gave the assignment, like a homework assignment, to check out the term New World Order into Google or just type it in and then go to News and look what you find out.
[01:17:31.969 --> 01:17:36.591]  Well, it's like hundreds of articles just about, you know, with the term New World Order in it.
[01:17:36.731 --> 01:17:40.193]  And then you have all kinds of variations like global order, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:17:40.873 --> 01:17:53.202]  And the key is, they're saying it's what we say it is, a world government run by one central bank where you pay carbon taxes, but then Wikipedia says it doesn't exist, and it's a theory, and we're crazy.
[01:17:54.522 --> 01:17:54.723]  Right.
[01:17:55.123 --> 01:17:56.284]  It's like absurd.
[01:17:56.464 --> 01:18:07.051]  And these articles, especially, why it is important to read these, because they all, more or less all, go from the viewpoint that it's a good thing.
[01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:09.572]  You know, it's the best thing there is.
[01:18:11.167 --> 01:18:13.228]  A crisis is created and we bring the solution.
[01:18:13.468 --> 01:18:16.169]  I just, right now, I ran into one.
[01:18:16.329 --> 01:18:18.991]  In times of crises, never forget the value of gold.
[01:18:20.631 --> 01:18:27.575]  On the Times Online webpage, and it begins with saying that the dollar is simply a piece of paper and gold is much better.
[01:18:28.275 --> 01:18:31.857]  Of course it is, but it ends with the following quote, if I may.
[01:18:31.877 --> 01:18:35.618]  A worldwide system of international money is needed.
[01:18:35.838 --> 01:18:39.320]  Without it, recurrent crises, such as the present one, will be inevitable.
[01:18:39.853 --> 01:18:44.709]  Governments need to create a new world system in which gold as a stabilizer should play its part.
[01:18:46.969 --> 01:18:48.409]  I mean, it's so subtle.
[01:18:48.569 --> 01:18:50.250]  Now, again, what do we always say?
[01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:56.531]  They're going to destroy all the currencies of the world, they've hoarded all the gold, and then gold's going to go into the stratosphere.
[01:18:56.791 --> 01:18:58.171]  People are like, well, then why are you saying buy gold?
[01:18:58.191 --> 01:18:59.451]  Because it's the only way to protect yourself.
[01:19:00.172 --> 01:19:01.772]  I mean, that's one of the only ways.
[01:19:01.832 --> 01:19:12.034]  That's what I'm saying, is that, I mean, did you hear me read Time Magazine, where the article was called the New World Order, and it said a world bank will rule the United States and will pay taxes to it?
[01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:18.672]  I mean, that's in the Financial Times of London, the Wall Street Journal says the only solution is world government, and Amaro.
[01:19:19.172 --> 01:19:28.875]  I mean, they're pushing it, and then meanwhile Rush Limbaugh says it doesn't exist, Obama says it doesn't exist, and Wikipedia says we're making it up.
[01:19:30.755 --> 01:19:33.356]  Yeah, this double think has to stop, you know, sooner or later.
[01:19:35.276 --> 01:19:36.417]  It is double think, isn't it?
[01:19:37.537 --> 01:19:37.797]  Yeah.
[01:19:39.438 --> 01:19:39.998]  It's pretty awful.
[01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:49.933]  I found another quote on the europeanvoice.com website.
[01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:53.576]  It said a global green new deal is needed.
[01:19:53.897 --> 01:19:55.318]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:19:56.991 --> 01:20:03.055]  They want a new deal, like a Roosevelt-style, but then globally and green.
[01:20:03.536 --> 01:20:04.496]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:20:04.677 --> 01:20:05.937]  No, no, that's the taxes.
[01:20:06.398 --> 01:20:07.158]  That's the taxes.
[01:20:07.198 --> 01:20:07.759]  Send me that article.
[01:20:07.779 --> 01:20:08.519]  I haven't seen that one.
[01:20:08.539 --> 01:20:10.020]  I've seen probably 500 others.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:10.841]  I'm not exaggerating.
[01:20:11.261 --> 01:20:15.344]  I mean, if you type the term New World Order, thousands of articles come up that are mainstream news.
[01:20:18.487 --> 01:20:18.987]  Pretty bizarre.
[01:20:21.536 --> 01:20:24.597]  I will email it to Aaron at InfoWatch.com.
[01:20:24.957 --> 01:20:27.077]  Yes, are folks waking up in the Netherlands?
[01:20:28.618 --> 01:20:30.018]  Well, slowly but surely.
[01:20:32.499 --> 01:20:45.162]  We just had a chip, like an RFID chip, for transportation in Rotterdam, the harbour city, and it's being rejected in mass, so that's pretty good.
[01:20:45.987 --> 01:20:48.629]  There still has to be a lot of work that needs to be done.
[01:20:49.009 --> 01:20:49.410]  That's right.
[01:20:49.450 --> 01:20:51.231]  The people instinctively know it's a fraud.
[01:20:51.251 --> 01:20:51.892]  Good to hear from you.
[01:20:52.152 --> 01:20:53.213]  Pull up on this computer.
[01:20:53.253 --> 01:20:55.455]  I want to show people the Huffington Post article.
[01:20:55.475 --> 01:20:57.436]  It's the one I wanted to talk about that I keep mentioning.
[01:20:57.456 --> 01:20:59.798]  Somebody emailed me a few days ago going, the bill didn't say that.
[01:20:59.818 --> 01:21:01.740]  Well, you can link through and read the Banker Bailout Bill.
[01:21:03.801 --> 01:21:10.607]  Right down here it says, decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-renewable and committed to agency discretion.
[01:21:11.636 --> 01:21:15.219]  They may not be reviewed by any court or law or any administrative agency.
[01:21:15.879 --> 01:21:22.444]  And then they pass the bill and they won't say how many trillions have been stolen, though it's leaked out that it's over nine trillion according to Bloomberg and AP.
[01:21:25.266 --> 01:21:28.428]  And we're now four months into this and now they want a new banker bailout.
[01:21:28.908 --> 01:21:31.390]  Why would they need a new banker bailout if they've got unlimited power?
[01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:35.493]  Because the new deal is to sign everything over to this new global banking system.
[01:21:36.499 --> 01:21:41.402]  So there's the headline, Dirty Secret of the Bailout, 32 words that none dare utter.
[01:21:41.802 --> 01:21:44.744]  We'll come back, go to more of your phone calls, straight ahead.
[01:21:45.284 --> 01:21:49.006]  I'm Alex Jones, the websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[01:21:50.627 --> 01:21:53.609]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.549 --> 01:21:57.251]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.754 --> 01:22:07.137]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:22:07.517 --> 01:22:09.498]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:11.178]  But who is the enemy?
[01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:12.219]  Bin Laden.
[01:22:12.499 --> 01:22:13.319]  This is his ammo.
[01:22:13.419 --> 01:22:14.860]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.580]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:22:16.861 --> 01:22:23.623]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:22:24.023 --> 01:22:24.464]  Some U.S.
[01:22:24.504 --> 01:22:30.146]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:22:30.846 --> 01:22:34.328]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:22:34.348 --> 01:22:37.150]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:23:00.871 --> 01:23:03.492]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:23:04.072 --> 01:23:07.053]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:23:07.413 --> 01:23:10.834]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:23:11.194 --> 01:23:17.376]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:23:17.776 --> 01:23:22.818]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:29.700]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.

[01:23:53.166 --> 01:23:55.427]  Aging doesn't only show in your face, but it can be felt in your body.

[01:25:27.435 --> 01:25:32.696]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing, till they got a hold of me.
[01:25:36.138 --> 01:25:37.219]  We're good.
[01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:02.317]  We are back live.
[01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:03.478]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:26:03.598 --> 01:26:04.399]  Yeah.
[01:26:04.919 --> 01:26:08.523]  Hamburgers are the hummers of food and global warming.
[01:26:08.543 --> 01:26:11.606]  See, they're introducing this to you.
[01:26:11.626 --> 01:26:18.753]  The IMF, the World Bank, the United Nations, the Club of Rome, the CFR, Greenpeace, Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club.
[01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:22.156]  They all say they're going to tax every facet of your life.
[01:26:22.196 --> 01:26:22.797]  That's coming up.
[01:26:24.161 --> 01:26:26.122]  But first, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:26:26.842 --> 01:26:29.303]  Let's talk to Jim in Florida.
[01:26:30.064 --> 01:26:31.404]  Jim, you are on the air.
[01:26:31.464 --> 01:26:31.865]  Welcome.
[01:26:32.545 --> 01:26:33.065]  Can you hear me?
[01:26:33.405 --> 01:26:34.266]  Yes, I can.
[01:26:34.706 --> 01:26:35.807]  Okay.
[01:26:36.047 --> 01:26:43.690]  If you and Willie Nelson could get a picture taken of the two of you holding up a sign saying InfoWars.com, 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:26:44.151 --> 01:26:45.011]  Both of you sign it.
[01:26:45.475 --> 01:26:52.124]  Those would be framed and hanging in places of honor in homes, restaurants, bars, and stores all over the world.
[01:27:01.363 --> 01:27:02.143]  That's what I mean.
[01:27:02.244 --> 01:27:04.505]  It would be a good way for Willie to get his message out.
[01:27:04.545 --> 01:27:08.948]  You guys could make a little money and lots of people would find out about it.
[01:27:08.968 --> 01:27:11.189]  Look, I don't approach Willie Nelson about money stuff.
[01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:13.370]  I mean, I've got his home number and his cell phone.
[01:27:13.410 --> 01:27:14.111]  I can call him up.
[01:27:14.151 --> 01:27:16.232]  I'm sure I could go hang out with him again if I wanted to.
[01:27:16.252 --> 01:27:17.473]  He's a busy guy on tour.
[01:27:17.493 --> 01:27:19.934]  200 and something days out of the year he makes movies.
[01:27:20.314 --> 01:27:22.015]  Just because Willie Nelson reached out to us.
[01:27:22.035 --> 01:27:23.256]  Just because I've had him on the air.
[01:27:23.656 --> 01:27:25.377]  Just because I've hung out with him and Jesse Ventura.
[01:27:25.397 --> 01:27:26.118]  Boy, that was crazy.
[01:27:27.158 --> 01:27:30.981]  Yeah, I have a one that called you a couple times over a year ago and suggested that everybody write info.
[01:27:56.698 --> 01:27:58.880]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:59.421]  A lot of cars
[01:28:24.187 --> 01:28:26.670]  I'm off the subject now because I get so confused with people talking.
[01:28:27.692 --> 01:28:31.076]  A lot of people do have stuff on their cars, on money, on things like that that's having a big effect.
[01:28:31.357 --> 01:28:32.538]  And I forgot the other point I was going to make.
[01:28:33.219 --> 01:28:35.743]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:28:37.064 --> 01:28:39.127]  Let's go ahead and talk to Charles in California.
[01:28:39.167 --> 01:28:39.948]  Charles, go ahead.
[01:28:41.042 --> 01:28:41.823]  Hi, can you hear me, Alex?
[01:28:42.203 --> 01:28:42.403]  Yes.
[01:28:42.423 --> 01:28:43.684]  Yeah, hi.
[01:28:44.024 --> 01:28:53.431]  I was just curious if you were familiar with, or you would consider having a guest to interview on your show, perhaps Tripp Wesner, the lead singer for the band Nine Inch Nails.
[01:28:53.451 --> 01:29:01.556]  He did an album a year ago called Year Zero that deals with martial law, the police state, the incrementalism, all the stuff that you talk about.
[01:29:01.576 --> 01:29:03.437]  I was curious if you'd have him as a guest on your show.
[01:29:04.558 --> 01:29:05.679]  And my other question was,
[01:29:06.252 --> 01:29:17.618]  I was curious, I've never heard you talk about Jimmy Carter and the Carter administration, because Jimmy, it seems to me anyway, that he tried to install a lot of policies like Ron Paul, but failed to do so.
[01:29:17.738 --> 01:29:22.841]  No, he actually set up FEMA and did a lot of bad, because I know people that were in the Carter administration, high level.
[01:29:22.901 --> 01:29:25.823]  He was a decent... Excuse me.
[01:29:25.843 --> 01:29:31.526]  I've had really bad allergies with this cedar pollen.
[01:29:31.826 --> 01:29:32.607]  Makes me cough a lot.
[01:29:33.769 --> 01:29:35.731]  Can somebody bring me a glass of Cola Blue Water please?
[01:29:35.751 --> 01:29:36.071]  Thank you.
[01:29:38.653 --> 01:29:40.034]  Jimmy Carter was a front man.
[01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:41.535]  Jimmy Carter didn't know what was going on.
[01:29:41.595 --> 01:29:48.081]  Jimmy Carter was controlled by Zbigniew Brzezinski who funded Pol Pot to kill 2-3 million people and he brags about it in Cambodia.
[01:29:48.461 --> 01:29:54.626]  Jimmy Carter brought in a whole lot of bad stuff and was basically just used as a front man by the New World Order, but go ahead.
[01:29:55.461 --> 01:30:15.096]  Well, I was just going to kick it, because I had never really heard you talk about it, but I also wanted to recommend, there's a guy named Greg Greffin, who, he's the front man of the band Bad Religion, and he talks also a lot about the stuff that you talk about, and I was curious if you'd either consider, perhaps, him or Trey Reznor from Nunage Nails to be a guest on your show?
[01:30:15.116 --> 01:30:16.177]  Well, let me tell you what happens.
[01:30:16.217 --> 01:30:17.378]  A lot of you know these people.
[01:30:18.158 --> 01:30:22.322]  Every week, or more often, I have big country music people,
[01:30:23.621 --> 01:30:29.443]  Rock and roll folks, blues, you name it, movie stars call here.
[01:30:30.244 --> 01:30:37.547]  And nine times out of ten I end up getting around to calling them back and they're like, I just want to tell you you're doing a great job and I really appreciate you but I don't want to go public.
[01:30:37.887 --> 01:30:41.648]  I've got a lot of private personal things going on right now and I'm in a divorce or this or that.
[01:30:43.857 --> 01:30:45.399]  Well, that doesn't really do anything.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:49.284]  Which is fine and dandy, but we're not just into hanging around with celebrities.
[01:30:49.805 --> 01:30:59.739]  So I always get invited out to somebody's house, or I get invited up to somebody's penthouse, or I get invited to, hey, get on my jet and go with me to, you know, we're going to London for the weekend, or Paris or something.
[01:30:59.779 --> 01:31:00.360]  Bring your wife.
[01:31:02.415 --> 01:31:09.540]  Instead, I'm, and maybe I should do that, because then I get to know them, and get them on air, and we get the information out more, because this is a hype-driven society.
[01:31:10.181 --> 01:31:11.542]  I'm going to be here working all day.
[01:31:11.562 --> 01:31:19.788]  I'm going to run home and see my children for about two hours, and I'm going to come back in the coast-to-coast AM, work on the film, and I'll get to bed about probably 4.30 in the morning tomorrow.
[01:31:20.368 --> 01:31:22.109]  And I'm not, again, it's all about me.
[01:31:22.269 --> 01:31:25.412]  I should get this celebrity, I should get that celebrity, I should do this, I should get that.
[01:31:26.712 --> 01:31:29.034]  I should have this person on, and those are all great ideas.
[01:31:30.555 --> 01:31:33.637]  I've been pointed out in my office that Trent Reznor does talk about the New World Order.
[01:31:34.137 --> 01:31:35.578]  We haven't reached out to Trent Reznor.
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:38.980]  I've heard about the bad religion.
[01:31:39.441 --> 01:31:41.822]  In fact, I had one of the guys here in the office telling me about that.
[01:31:44.392 --> 01:31:46.834]  Audio Slave is putting on anti-new order stuff.
[01:31:46.874 --> 01:31:47.415]  That's good!
[01:31:47.475 --> 01:31:49.697]  That's them out there doing their own thing.
[01:31:50.257 --> 01:31:53.440]  And if they want to contact me and say they want to come on air, we'll have them on air.
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:58.664]  We're not out there trying to track down celebrities just to get them on, just to do it.
[01:32:01.146 --> 01:32:02.628]  Charlie Sheen contacted me.
[01:32:04.109 --> 01:32:06.171]  Folks with Jesse Ventura contacted us.
[01:32:07.432 --> 01:32:08.192]  Folks with
[01:32:10.009 --> 01:32:13.492]  Well, the whole Willie Nelson thing is he was at an event that I was at.
[01:32:13.572 --> 01:32:14.112]  I saw him.
[01:32:14.512 --> 01:32:16.153]  He said, hey, I'd come on your show sometime.
[01:32:16.173 --> 01:32:16.694]  I like what you're doing.
[01:32:16.714 --> 01:32:17.554]  I gave him some videos.
[01:32:17.875 --> 01:32:20.076]  And then, boom, six months later he calls up.
[01:32:22.598 --> 01:32:24.920]  And I almost don't like doing it.
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:27.201]  It's a double-edged sword, and I appreciate your call.
[01:32:28.162 --> 01:32:29.323]  There's all this news going on, folks.
[01:32:29.343 --> 01:32:30.624]  You shouldn't be talking about me all day.
[01:32:30.664 --> 01:32:33.126]  But, you know, it's all about the effectiveness of getting the word out.
[01:32:37.759 --> 01:32:49.748]  You know, when I have big celebrities on the show, a lot of the general public and other activists think that celebrities like live on clouds, and they float around in angel world, and you're not fulfilled until you're a celebrity.
[01:32:49.788 --> 01:33:02.138]  But then you really get a chance, and I know a lot of celebrities, folks, because I've been in a few movies and some other things, and I've consulted for some other films, not just Scanner Darkly, but I don't even want to get on record some of the films I've consulted for.
[01:33:02.558 --> 01:33:03.719]  I didn't like how some of them turned out.
[01:33:07.368 --> 01:33:18.423]  So you're sitting there in somebody's Hollywood house, they're interesting, they're cool people, but they don't want to go out to get dinner because people mob them and you're just there and it's just another person.
[01:33:20.086 --> 01:33:32.957]  I gotta say, hanging out for just one time, four hours with Willie Nelson at his house, he brings various people in his house itself, you know, hanging out in his bedroom playing chess with Jesse Ventura and Willie Nelson and Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.017 --> 01:33:34.138]  That's pretty weird.
[01:33:34.158 --> 01:33:35.539]  I mean, that's pretty cool.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.801]  But, you know, it's the mission.
[01:33:38.902 --> 01:33:39.582]  It's the mission.
[01:33:39.662 --> 01:33:40.303]  It's the mission.
[01:33:41.795 --> 01:33:46.320]  And people get so jealous of that, that it becomes destructive.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:52.126]  Because we're here trying to get the word out, get other activists to go out and wake people up and be about issues.
[01:33:52.626 --> 01:33:58.032]  And every time I have some big celebrity on, people just go ape with the disinfo and the lies and the attacks.
[01:33:58.072 --> 01:33:59.473]  And it's not government, most of it.
[01:33:59.994 --> 01:34:02.536]  It is the sick, fallen nature of society.
[01:34:03.467 --> 01:34:08.571]  And a lot of people who are in power positions get off on people being jealous of them.
[01:34:08.811 --> 01:34:09.752]  They love being attacked.
[01:34:09.792 --> 01:34:10.612]  They think it's funny.
[01:34:11.393 --> 01:34:12.313]  They know it's jealousy.
[01:34:12.734 --> 01:34:14.975]  And at a sick level, I kind of like it too.
[01:34:15.976 --> 01:34:16.676]  But it's sick.
[01:34:17.377 --> 01:34:22.921]  And so it actually hurts my feelings because we have no future, folks.
[01:34:22.941 --> 01:34:28.345]  I mean, I'm having discussions with my wife about, you know, is it moral that we're staying here as the country collapses?
[01:34:29.686 --> 01:34:31.067]  But we made the decision to stay.
[01:34:32.188 --> 01:34:34.109]  That's a big decision when you're Alex Jones.
[01:34:42.273 --> 01:34:44.574]  And so I understand how life and death all this is.
[01:34:44.594 --> 01:34:46.195]  This isn't a joke or a game for me.
[01:34:47.375 --> 01:34:52.618]  And that's why I can work as hard as I do and do the things I do because I understand this is life and death, folks.
[01:34:52.678 --> 01:34:54.559]  I've got my priorities in line.
[01:34:58.018 --> 01:35:02.323]  I try to work with everybody that's uplifting, everybody that's networking, everybody that's decent and wholesome.
[01:35:02.703 --> 01:35:10.691]  If you don't hear somebody on this show who's prominent in the fighting in civil war, it means they're bad news, from my experience and what I've dealt with.
[01:35:11.492 --> 01:35:14.976]  And it's just very destructive overall, the things that go on.
[01:35:14.996 --> 01:35:16.818]  Now we've had two calls in a row about celebrities.
[01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:17.959]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:35:17.999 --> 01:35:19.620]  It's kind of sick at a certain level.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.383]  Yeah, when we have a big celebrity on, it blows the show up even bigger.
[01:35:23.743 --> 01:35:25.604]  Other celebrities then start tuning in.
[01:35:26.965 --> 01:35:32.510]  But then it just kind of becomes a self-fulfilling, you know, prophecy of your show being about that.
[01:35:32.530 --> 01:35:37.934]  I mean, that's basically it.
[01:35:39.264 --> 01:35:40.405]  FEMA camps are being built.
[01:35:40.445 --> 01:35:42.887]  They've introduced gun confiscation and gun ban bills.
[01:35:43.587 --> 01:35:44.968]  They are bringing in a new world order.
[01:35:44.988 --> 01:35:46.429]  They're setting up carbon taxes.
[01:35:46.569 --> 01:35:47.310]  It's happening.
[01:35:47.610 --> 01:35:48.251]  I mean, look at this.
[01:35:51.994 --> 01:35:56.337]  Hamburgers are the hummers of food and global warming.
[01:35:56.837 --> 01:35:59.759]  And they say that cows' methane is evil and hamburgers' bad.
[01:35:59.779 --> 01:36:05.644]  And not only is there going to be a global warming tax on the cows and all their farm animals themselves and all the federal control that comes with that,
[01:36:06.803 --> 01:36:09.724]  But that they're going to put a tax on you eating hamburger.
[01:36:09.885 --> 01:36:10.805]  Folks, I told you this.
[01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:11.765]  They've said it.
[01:36:12.246 --> 01:36:15.507]  Ice cream, pastries, hamburgers, everything.
[01:36:15.907 --> 01:36:17.969]  And with that, the federal control over the food supply.
[01:36:19.749 --> 01:36:25.112]  When it comes to global warming, hamburgers are the hummers of food, scientists say, from agency French Press.
[01:36:25.572 --> 01:36:26.793]  They just state this like it's a fact.
[01:36:28.075 --> 01:36:34.020]  Simply switching from steak to salad could cut as much carbon as leaving the car at home a couple of days a week.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.221]  Yeah, what'd that salad breathe?
[01:36:35.281 --> 01:36:36.262]  It breathed carbon dioxide.
[01:36:36.763 --> 01:36:46.271]  That's because beef is such an incredibly inefficient food to produce and cows release so much harmful methane to the atmosphere, said Nathan Pelletier of Dulles University in Canada.
[01:36:47.032 --> 01:36:51.676]  They're one of a growing number of scientists studying the environmental cost of food from the field to plate.
[01:36:53.898 --> 01:36:54.879]  And they say they want to tax it.
[01:36:56.509 --> 01:36:58.571]  78% of emissions from the cows.
[01:37:00.192 --> 01:37:02.695]  I mean, methane is part of our atmosphere.
[01:37:04.156 --> 01:37:05.537]  That's why the planet's alive.
[01:37:05.998 --> 01:37:06.799]  It's good!
[01:37:09.383 --> 01:37:11.744]  The gases in the atmosphere protect us from the solar radiation.
[01:37:11.764 --> 01:37:17.046]  Folks, it's such an insult to everyone that they have everybody wanting to ban carbon dioxide.
[01:37:17.607 --> 01:37:18.887]  It's what plants breathe.
[01:37:19.147 --> 01:37:20.348]  Where's my astronaut article?
[01:37:21.068 --> 01:37:21.709]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[01:37:21.729 --> 01:37:23.729]  Here's the New York Times saying, do we need a new internet?
[01:37:23.769 --> 01:37:30.973]  And they say they're going to kill the old internet and have an internet that, quote, where you give up your freedoms for safety.
[01:37:34.554 --> 01:37:38.216]  I mean, this is just amazing.
[01:37:39.633 --> 01:37:40.854]  All right, let's go back to your calls here.
[01:37:41.815 --> 01:37:42.475]  Who's up next?
[01:37:43.216 --> 01:37:43.496]  Jeff?
[01:37:45.198 --> 01:37:46.118]  Jeff in California.
[01:37:46.158 --> 01:37:46.979]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:48.820]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[01:37:49.001 --> 01:37:49.401]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:50.962 --> 01:37:52.363]  Yes, I had a question.
[01:37:53.905 --> 01:37:57.367]  My grandpa was in the Marine Corps for 22 years.
[01:37:57.407 --> 01:37:58.628]  He retired as a major.
[01:37:59.389 --> 01:38:02.532]  He just died recently in October 29th.
[01:38:02.832 --> 01:38:06.515]  Do you think what part of the Agent Orange killed him?
[01:38:08.522 --> 01:38:10.024]  I don't know that Agent Orange killed him.
[01:38:10.064 --> 01:38:26.199]  I know Agent Orange lasts for over a hundred years and there's whole areas of Hawaii and where it's been used and also in Vietnam and other areas where it's been used where no plants still grow and it massively increases cancers and all sorts of other health problems and birth defects and they knew it when they sprayed it and they had the troops walk right through it.
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:29.822]  Yeah, I really feel sorry for him.
[01:38:29.862 --> 01:38:30.363]  He just was
[01:38:31.426 --> 01:38:35.827]  Uh, and also, why did he, uh, not, why did he like Bush?
[01:38:36.328 --> 01:38:36.948]  I don't get it.
[01:38:37.168 --> 01:38:42.709]  I kept trying to... Because they have the liberals come out with things he knows are bad, and so then he thinks Bush is the alternative.
[01:38:42.729 --> 01:38:45.850]  And then liberals don't like Bush, so they think Obama's the alternative.
[01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:47.791]  They're caught up in those two phony choices.
[01:38:49.151 --> 01:38:49.351]  Yeah.
[01:38:49.371 --> 01:38:56.154]  That'd be like if a guy came to your door and said, I've got a blue vacuum cleaner and a red vacuum cleaner, and then you can make the choice.
[01:38:56.534 --> 01:38:57.614]  It's a psychological game.
[01:38:57.654 --> 01:38:58.434]  It's a false choice.
[01:38:58.714 --> 01:39:00.695]  How about, I already got a vacuum cleaner, thank you.
[01:39:02.213 --> 01:39:02.614]  Okay.
[01:39:02.994 --> 01:39:04.216]  I also have another question.
[01:39:05.037 --> 01:39:06.399]  What do I tell my neighbor?
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:08.202]  She's very pro-Obama.
[01:39:08.963 --> 01:39:09.444]  She can't...
[01:39:10.888 --> 01:39:14.292]  She says that he can, I think she thinks he can do no wrong.
[01:39:14.872 --> 01:39:20.017]  What can I, what has he done that I can tell her that is bad?
[01:39:20.698 --> 01:39:31.769]  Well, we're going to expand it, but at theobamadeception.net, theobamadeception.net, right there, by the way the film is now in pre-order, it ships March 15th, first come first serve, the orders that come in.
[01:39:33.922 --> 01:39:40.245]  The film covers it all, but there's a section on Obama's lies, his flip-flopping, his police state, the things he's done.
[01:39:40.286 --> 01:39:44.808]  We're going to update it even more, because there's so much that's right there on the site, sir.
[01:39:45.748 --> 01:39:55.654]  Yeah, I do know that Congress just passed a bill that they didn't even get to read, and this new stimulus bill was what?
[01:39:56.918 --> 01:39:57.418]  700 billion?
[01:39:57.619 --> 01:39:59.941]  Probably, isn't it more like trillions?
[01:40:00.362 --> 01:40:04.727]  Yeah, because it's mandated each year to continue with the funding.
[01:40:05.768 --> 01:40:06.549]  Look, I appreciate your call.
[01:40:06.929 --> 01:40:09.092]  I covered this last Sunday night, last night.
[01:40:09.913 --> 01:40:11.014]  It all just runs together now.
[01:40:12.475 --> 01:40:15.579]  Obama said it must pass, it must pass, doom and destruction.
[01:40:15.619 --> 01:40:16.920]  I will sign it the minute it's passed.
[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:21.103]  Then it's signed, Friday he goes on vacation till tomorrow.
[01:40:21.644 --> 01:40:22.525]  A five day vacation.
[01:40:23.245 --> 01:40:24.867]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
[01:40:25.368 --> 01:40:26.429]  Four and a half day vacation.
[01:40:28.169 --> 01:40:30.650]  They rush it through so no one can read it.
[01:40:31.131 --> 01:40:33.132]  And then, oh, now I can sign it in five days.
[01:40:33.852 --> 01:40:34.852]  Same thing with the last bill.
[01:40:35.032 --> 01:40:37.353]  We've got to have it or the economy is going to implode right now.
[01:40:37.573 --> 01:40:39.734]  We've got to have it to buy these bad mortgage assets.
[01:40:40.335 --> 01:40:41.395]  October 3rd it passes.
[01:40:41.455 --> 01:40:44.336]  October 4th they said, we're going to keep the money for something else.
[01:40:44.376 --> 01:40:45.297]  Don't worry about it.
[01:40:45.657 --> 01:40:47.418]  The people said, well, you've got to tell us where you're spending.
[01:40:47.438 --> 01:40:48.518]  You promised transparency.
[01:40:48.938 --> 01:40:56.602]  And they went, both parties went, uh, did you read the subsection of the bill that says
[01:40:58.789 --> 01:41:01.090]  That no one can review this or look at this.
[01:41:01.110 --> 01:41:05.791]  Alright, we're going to come back and maybe take a few calls.
[01:41:05.811 --> 01:41:10.533]  I want to jam in this clip where there's a guy on the web saying I'm making it up about spider goats.
[01:41:11.813 --> 01:41:12.913]  He could Google right now.
[01:41:12.953 --> 01:41:14.594]  If that guy's Google, I'm going to show it on screen.
[01:41:14.954 --> 01:41:15.614]  Spider goats.
[01:41:16.214 --> 01:41:18.075]  Spider goat hybrids for body armor.
[01:41:18.535 --> 01:41:21.836]  Spider goat hybrids.
[01:41:21.876 --> 01:41:24.677]  And I'm going to show him the mainstream news about this.
[01:41:24.717 --> 01:41:26.057]  I've interviewed the CEO of the company.
[01:41:26.077 --> 01:41:28.178]  We're going to cover that when we get back.
[01:41:29.679 --> 01:41:31.660]  But it's just constant.
[01:41:31.841 --> 01:41:32.761]  I'm making all this up.
[01:41:32.801 --> 01:41:33.161]  No, I'm not.
[01:41:34.182 --> 01:41:37.665]  One of our sponsors I wanted to tell you about is Acola Blue, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:38.185 --> 01:41:48.632]  Acola Blue, that I am drinking right now, grabs the water out of the atmosphere, has a great little computer terminal of hot and cold water, runs it through seven filters inside, 800-691-6063,
[01:41:54.113 --> 01:41:55.634]  I said that wrong as I took it off screen.
[01:41:55.654 --> 01:41:55.694]  800-691-6043.
[01:41:55.714 --> 01:41:55.974]  800-691-6043.
[01:41:55.994 --> 01:41:56.034]  800-691-6043.
[01:41:56.054 --> 01:41:56.414]  ECOLOblue.com.
[01:41:56.434 --> 01:41:58.535]  Atmospheric water generator for your home.
[01:41:58.555 --> 01:42:02.777]  Pays for yourself within one year of you buy your water from the store.
[01:42:02.797 --> 01:42:06.259]  Pure clean water without the fluoride.
[01:42:06.399 --> 01:42:07.840]  Unlimited water for the humidity in the air.
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.581]  Machine produces up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours.
[01:42:16.724 --> 01:42:19.927]  That's seven and a half gallons, great tasting pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[01:42:20.227 --> 01:42:21.488]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[01:42:21.508 --> 01:42:31.616]  So it grabs it out of the air, then sends it through seven filters, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, UV, antibacterial, antifungal light.
[01:42:32.177 --> 01:42:33.097]  The best stuff out there.
[01:42:33.117 --> 01:42:34.138]  In fact, cut to me real fast.
[01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:40.832]  Though I have some ceramic cups, I shouldn't be drinking out of plastic.
[01:42:41.212 --> 01:42:43.293]  This leeches estrogen mimicking hormones.
[01:42:43.994 --> 01:42:45.995]  But, uh, anyways, thecolorblue.com.
[01:42:46.335 --> 01:42:48.196]  Alright, thanks to the sponsors that make the show possible.
[01:42:48.456 --> 01:42:59.183]  We're gonna come back in the final segment, and, uh, I'm gonna play part of the clip, and he's sitting there smoking weed going, man, Alex is making stuff up, it's ridiculous.
[01:43:00.704 --> 01:43:07.907]  Yourfoodstorage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest-priced, highest-quality, storable food for over a decade.
[01:43:08.067 --> 01:43:12.248]  And right now, a one-year food supply that feeds 4 to 5 people is only $39.95.
[01:43:13.029 --> 01:43:17.290]  That's right, a one-year supply that feeds 4 to 5 people for under $4,000.
[01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:17.670]  That's only $0.92.
[01:43:21.169 --> 01:43:21.790]  We're good to go.
[01:43:39.238 --> 01:43:39.638]  I think so.
[01:44:00.473 --> 01:44:13.241]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:44:13.621 --> 01:44:24.288]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:44:24.668 --> 01:44:27.891]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:44:28.091 --> 01:44:29.813]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:44:29.853 --> 01:44:35.598]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:44:51.651 --> 01:44:53.832]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[01:44:54.232 --> 01:44:55.112]  Truth is our weapon.
[01:44:55.452 --> 01:44:59.574]  And PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:08.357]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:45:08.517 --> 01:45:12.919]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:45:13.099 --> 01:45:17.600]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.181]  It's a documented fact.
[01:45:20.042 --> 01:45:26.668]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[01:45:26.808 --> 01:45:38.659]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[01:45:38.919 --> 01:45:42.583]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.

[01:45:53.552 --> 01:45:53.872]  That's 888-949-3570.
[01:45:53.912 --> 01:45:55.293]  Yeah, I'm gonna play this clip.
[01:45:55.313 --> 01:45:56.715]  Hopefully you can hear it.
[01:45:56.735 --> 01:45:57.475]  I wanna make this clear.
[01:45:57.555 --> 01:45:58.696]  GMO was created by the eugenicists.
[01:46:09.454 --> 01:46:12.376]  They understand that breeding and seeds and animals is key.
[01:46:12.716 --> 01:46:17.440]  And they've just conditioned us to announce, hey, cloned beef on store shelves now, without labels.
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:21.203]  Cloned chickens, cloned cows, it's all out there now, it's all been announced.
[01:46:21.703 --> 01:46:24.845]  Oh, we're doing cross-species human hybrids for organ harvesting.
[01:46:25.766 --> 01:46:28.448]  But we're keeping them small, down at the little embryo level.
[01:46:28.808 --> 01:46:30.850]  Then you read deeper in the research, they're not.
[01:46:31.090 --> 01:46:32.271]  That's the stuff they admit.
[01:46:33.266 --> 01:46:33.526]  Okay.
[01:46:33.586 --> 01:46:35.487]  Spiders with goats for body armor, guys.
[01:46:35.587 --> 01:46:41.390]  He says if you go back and research what he is talking about, you will find spiders with goats for body armor.
[01:47:05.342 --> 01:47:19.292]  Now, uh, about Alex Jones and similar people that are, you know, pretty much in the same arena trying to wake people up like him, um, I just want to give a warning.
[01:47:20.032 --> 01:47:27.237]  Beware of groupthink and always research everything.
[01:47:28.558 --> 01:47:29.999]  Everything.
[01:47:31.861 --> 01:47:32.221]  Okay?
[01:47:33.533 --> 01:48:01.616]  Now, when I say beware of groupthink, now, if there was, say, a band that you went to go see, a musical band, that was, you know, they were kinda lousy, and they didn't really fit your style, and you didn't really just like what they were doing, but you applauded and screamed, WOOO!
[01:48:02.217 --> 01:48:02.557]  Anyway,
[01:48:03.402 --> 01:48:04.843]  Along with the rest of the crowd.
[01:48:07.785 --> 01:48:12.067]  That, uh, is very dangerous.
[01:48:13.728 --> 01:48:15.509]  And I'll explain to you, uh, why.
[01:48:16.410 --> 01:48:23.434]  Because when it comes to, uh, the Alex Jones type, not just Alex Jones, but anybody like him.
[01:48:24.074 --> 01:48:27.176]  Now, listen to me, I'm a fan of him, okay?
[01:48:27.196 --> 01:48:29.537]  I enjoy the info that he has to give.
[01:48:30.018 --> 01:48:30.438]  I do not
[01:48:30.913 --> 01:48:34.295]  I believe 100% in anything anybody says.
[01:48:34.655 --> 01:48:39.478]  I research, and then I believe after that research is complete.
[01:48:39.758 --> 01:48:59.129]  But, when it comes to people like that, that are very prominent in what we call the truth movement or the patriotic movement, whatever the hell we're going by, the people that are awake, somebody very prominent like this individual can mislead
[01:49:00.593 --> 01:49:03.175]  I'm not trying to discredit him
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:21.121]  I haven't even researched the thing he just said.
[01:49:21.141 --> 01:49:23.903]  It just sounds too silly to actually bother to research.
[01:49:24.283 --> 01:49:25.264]  Alright, stop right there.
[01:49:25.284 --> 01:49:26.624]  I don't have time to put the rest of it.
[01:49:26.644 --> 01:49:28.186]  Here's a London Telegraph on screen.
[01:49:28.646 --> 01:49:29.246]  Spider Goats.
[01:49:29.426 --> 01:49:30.347]  Punch it back up so I can read it.
[01:49:30.407 --> 01:49:32.388]  Spider Goats start work on Wonder Web.
[01:49:32.949 --> 01:49:32.388]  2002.
[01:49:33.069 --> 01:49:34.810]  I interviewed the CEO of the company.
[01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:35.951]  They've got a bunch of companies doing it.
[01:49:36.311 --> 01:49:37.191]  What I said was...
[01:49:38.272 --> 01:49:44.396]  Mixing, I was talking about mixing species, mixing spiders and goats to then get body armor from the goats.
[01:49:45.037 --> 01:49:49.620]  And he said no, spiders are wearing goats on their backs as a shield.
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.100]  That's not what I said.
[01:49:51.321 --> 01:49:52.882]  I was talking about across species.
[01:49:54.162 --> 01:49:54.823]  And it's true!
[01:49:55.023 --> 01:50:00.827]  And people email me every day saying I'm a liar, and because they can't believe that because they're thinking of 1970s science fiction.
[01:50:01.607 --> 01:50:03.008]  This is what the government admits they're doing.
[01:50:03.068 --> 01:50:04.009]  Imagine what else they're doing.
[01:50:04.938 --> 01:50:06.340]  Again, I'm telling you the truth.
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:08.243]  Check the information out for yourself.
[01:50:08.803 --> 01:50:11.647]  You know, the guy that talked, Mark Dyson, he doesn't talk about the Antichrist.
[01:50:11.687 --> 01:50:12.608]  He wrote a whole book about it.
[01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:14.411]  And talked about it last week on the show.
[01:50:14.571 --> 01:50:15.692]  Alright, that was another guy.
[01:50:16.413 --> 01:50:19.017]  I'll be on Coast to Coast AM tonight for three hours.
[01:50:19.838 --> 01:50:21.159]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:21.199 --> 01:50:22.660]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:50.325 --> 01:50:51.887]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:52.007 --> 01:50:56.672]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:50:56.752 --> 01:50:59.516]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:50:59.716 --> 01:51:02.579]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:51:02.759 --> 01:51:07.485]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:51:07.705 --> 01:51:08.606]  If you simply prepare.
[01:51:08.827 --> 01:51:11.750]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:18.979]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
