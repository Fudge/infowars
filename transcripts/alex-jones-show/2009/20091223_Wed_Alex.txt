[00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:12.783]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:14.584]  Alex out on assignment in Dallas.
[00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:16.505]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in.
[00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:21.067]  And we are now joined by Kathryn Austin-Fitz.
[00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:22.168]  Oh no, we don't have her on yet?
[00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.669]  She'll be on in just a moment.
[00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.412]  She is the founder and managing member of Solari Investment Advisories LLC.
[00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:39.988]  She is a former assistant secretary of housing for the Federal Housing Commissioner under the first Bush administration.
[00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.916]  She's the president of the Hamilton Securities Group Investment Bank and financial software developer and a Wall Street insider.
[00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:57.485]  So we are going to get her take on the devaluing dollar, on gold hitting a record high, on what's really going on in Dubai.
[00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:03.267]  And how this is going to affect us, not only in the United States, but globally.
[00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:04.088]  How are you, Katherine?
[00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:05.508]  Hi, I'm fine!
[00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:08.569]  So let's just get right into it.
[00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.590]  We're seeing record numbers for gold today.
[00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.231]  The dollar continues to decline, and we're talking bailouts in Dubai.
[00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:19.212]  What does this all mean for us here at home?
[00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:25.894]  Well, what it means is our expenses are going to rise and our income is going to fall.
[00:01:26.955 --> 00:01:27.715]  It's that simple.
[00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:34.630]  And we're going through a structural change economically as a society.
[00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:53.721]  We have for the last 15 to 20 years moved abroad many of the high-paying manufacturing and other jobs and done it in a way that significantly weakened the union and anything that would protect the value of labor.
[00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:54.822]  So we're watching
[00:01:55.746 --> 00:02:21.631]  fundamental shift between the value of labor and the value of capital worldwide and It's it's an integral part of the way that globalization is being achieved And so we're just to the round with Dubai is sort of the latest The latest sort of crisis du jour related to what happens when you print lots and lots of financial paper
[00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.490]  Whether it's currency or bonds or debt securities.
[00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:32.093]  But you don't build up an equivalent amount of real wealth in the real economy.
[00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:42.338]  So we're watching a back and forth between all the paper that we've printed and the bubbles that we've engineered globally and the real economy.
[00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:46.000]  And the precious metals is really just the real economy thing.
[00:02:46.764 --> 00:02:47.485]  Hey, wait a minute.
[00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:48.827]  We don't want your paper.
[00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:50.990]  We're worth a lot more in terms of your paper.
[00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:55.576]  And the challenge for many of us is we're, many of us are just holding the paper.
[00:02:56.798 --> 00:03:02.601]  We just discussed briefly how this country has essentially been gutted from making anything.
[00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:07.263]  We don't really have an industry that creates and exports anything.
[00:03:07.303 --> 00:03:13.606]  In fact, I think our leading export at this point is garbage ideas and promises that really aren't there.
[00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:14.746]  I mean, how did this happen?
[00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:20.989]  How did we allow ourselves to stop manufacturing any physical materials whatsoever?
[00:03:22.173 --> 00:03:35.322]  Well, in the 1990s, we implemented the GATT Uruguay Round and created in 1995 the WTO, the World Trade Organization, which radically changed the rules.
[00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:42.007]  You know, it's like any game, when you blow a whistle and change all the rules, the whole game changes.
[00:03:42.828 --> 00:03:51.514]  And what the World Trade Organization and the GATT Round said is, we are now free to move capital in and out of any place.
[00:03:52.788 --> 00:04:03.271]  And basically shift jobs locally, globally, in a way where we can, you know, play labor off against each other around the world.
[00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:14.875]  And that's happening at the same time when you're instituting lots of new powerful technology, because a lot of this is made possible by telecommunications and satellite technology and digital technology.
[00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:22.237]  You're instituting it where it's possible to radically reduce the number of people you need
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.700]  We're good to go.
[00:04:36.564 --> 00:04:51.609]  So part of this is simply who gets the blessings of new technology and what we're saying is we're going to take all those blessings and productivity and centralize it into the wealth of the few and pull it out of the well-being of the many.
[00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.089]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:55.690]  We'll be back after this with Katherine Austin-Fitz.
[00:04:59.517 --> 00:05:03.519]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:06.361]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:07.742]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:05:07.762 --> 00:05:08.462]  It's very real.
[00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:10.704]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:05:10.824 --> 00:05:12.345]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:05:12.485 --> 00:05:16.827]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:05:59.221 --> 00:06:03.444]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:03.765 --> 00:06:04.385]  Number one.
[00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:07.848]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.108 --> 00:06:08.669]  Number two.
[00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:13.532]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:13.853 --> 00:06:14.313]  It's true.
[00:06:14.613 --> 00:06:19.157]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:19.457 --> 00:06:19.998]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.298 --> 00:06:23.581]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:23.881 --> 00:06:27.624]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:27.805 --> 00:06:28.345]  Number 4.
[00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:30.967]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.348 --> 00:06:34.751]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:35.572]  Number 5.
[00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:39.755]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:39.976 --> 00:06:44.740]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.045]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:50.767]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:53.070]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.540]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:13.001]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:13.721 --> 00:07:17.762]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:18.362 --> 00:07:29.164]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:29.804 --> 00:07:38.806]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:44.367]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:44.748 --> 00:07:51.949]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:54.650]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:05.616]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.297 --> 00:08:07.338]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.058 --> 00:08:09.160]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.641]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.402 --> 00:08:12.323]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.964 --> 00:08:16.568]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.148 --> 00:08:21.213]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.982 --> 00:08:24.163]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:08:24.584 --> 00:08:28.467]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in for Alex Jones, who's on assignment in Dallas.
[00:08:28.688 --> 00:08:36.975]  We're with Katherine Austin-Fitz, and you were talking about, really, the restructuring of the global economy and the economy here at home.
[00:08:37.716 --> 00:08:43.141]  How do you feel the SDR, or Special Drawing Rights Unit, that the IMF is now
[00:08:43.841 --> 00:08:46.323]  Really issuing fervently fits into all that.
[00:08:46.363 --> 00:08:50.146]  Is this the global currency that they plan to replace the dollar with?
[00:08:50.206 --> 00:08:54.349]  Because there's all this talk that the dollar can no longer be the world reserve currency.
[00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:58.852]  And it would seem that although this hasn't taken a physical form yet, that may be the next step.
[00:08:59.693 --> 00:09:01.714]  Well, there are a couple things happening at once, Jason.
[00:09:01.734 --> 00:09:06.478]  The first is there is tremendous tension between the financial
[00:09:07.979 --> 00:09:32.536]  Really speculative economy in the real economy, and if you look at the countries and the organizations trying to implement trade around the world, it's very painful to be trying to, you know, move bananas from here to there when the currency or securities you're operating with to manage a real business have become really a tool of financial speculation and economic warfare.
[00:09:32.616 --> 00:09:34.498]  So we see tremendous demands
[00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:35.522]  Thank you.
[00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:50.093]  From the financial speculation.
[00:09:51.074 --> 00:09:57.920]  So there's a demand for a global currency that's outside the global speculation system.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.480]  That's one.
[00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:05.327]  Number two, there's no doubt there's a desire also to get off the dollar, because the dollar's in a long-term decline.
[00:10:06.007 --> 00:10:11.853]  And what the dollar has become is, in one sense, is a form of global taxation through the balance sheets.
[00:10:12.453 --> 00:10:18.697]  So countries around the world buy dollars, they go down in value, and literally it's a taxation system.
[00:10:19.397 --> 00:10:28.242]  So there's a real desire for something, one, that's global, that's two, that's outside of the speculation, and three, it's not going down in value.
[00:10:28.262 --> 00:10:34.106]  And that's part of what you're seeing with the FDRs and the movement to a global currency.
[00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.052]  I don't know.
[00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:58.353]  Once the dollar is dumped as the world reserve currency, is this literally the death of the dollar and we would need some kind of other currency in the United States?
[00:10:58.393 --> 00:11:01.274]  Would this trigger even a deeper depression?
[00:11:01.334 --> 00:11:09.277]  I know that Obama's talking about a double-dip recession, which to me is just a semantical word game to say, hey, things aren't going to get any better.
[00:11:09.517 --> 00:11:11.877]  They dare not use the term depression.
[00:11:12.118 --> 00:11:17.199]  But if the dollar is taken away as the global reserve currency, does it survive?
[00:11:17.479 --> 00:11:18.960]  And what happens here in the United States?
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.601]  Well, I don't think we're going through a depression or recession.
[00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:25.902]  I think we're going through, I call it a financial coup d'etat.
[00:11:27.022 --> 00:11:37.584]  So I think what you're watching is a fundamental re-engineering of how the world is governed, and it's intentional, and it's planned.
[00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:41.725]  Now, it happens in organic ways.
[00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:44.706]  It's not as though it's perfectly scripted.
[00:11:45.453 --> 00:12:04.010]  But we're going through a fundamental change and the decision to basically reduce the middle class to a much lower income with much less political power lifestyle was an intentional decision made in the 90s.
[00:12:04.911 --> 00:12:11.677]  And essentially what has happened is you have one or two generations in the United States that built up huge wealth.
[00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:30.293]  Over their lifetime and what we saw was that wealth transferred Out of the economy and abroad during the 90s sort of hidden behind the bubble But that's an intentional thing and so when we talk about this in terms of depression and recession We're talking about business cycles, and that's not really the traditional.
[00:12:30.353 --> 00:12:35.178]  We're not watching a traditional business cycle we're watching a fundamental re-engineering of a
[00:12:35.896 --> 00:12:42.097]  And centralization of economic and political control, and it's very much global and very planned out.
[00:12:42.798 --> 00:12:43.778]  Let me give you an example.
[00:12:44.398 --> 00:13:02.362]  I was in London in 2002 to give a paper on, it's called the Myth of the Rule of Law, about how the process of privatization was working here in the United States, and how things were, you know, basically criminal enterprises being used to centralize
[00:13:03.078 --> 00:13:09.559]  All sorts of ownership and control and real estate into a relatively small group of people.
[00:13:10.119 --> 00:13:24.882]  And I gave the paper, and following me there was a former reporter from the Wall Street Journal giving a paper about the economic warfare in Russia during the 90s, and then followed by a wonderful reporter in London who gave one on Eastern Europe.
[00:13:25.403 --> 00:13:32.064]  And we were all in a state of shock because we realized it was the same companies, the same banks, same hedge funds,
[00:13:32.762 --> 00:13:38.124]  Same defense contractors operating a syndicate in all three places.
[00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:59.473]  We just didn't, you know, we hadn't seen the game because we thought it was just North America or Russia or Eastern Europe and what we didn't see was there was a global process going on of buying up and controlling all sorts of land and real estate and enterprises and was very much part of a process of economic warfare that was going on globally.
[00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:16.574]  Well, when these elitists talk about redistribution of wealth, what they really mean is that their goal is to take the United States and take us from our first world nation status and delve us into this second world nation status as they consolidate power, as they gain more power.
[00:14:16.714 --> 00:14:23.557]  And I see this system being implemented with this cap-and-trade scam and now being exposed in Climategate.
[00:14:24.117 --> 00:14:28.319]  I mean, that's why they created these carbon markets and carbon prices.
[00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:31.440]  I mean, that the EU openly trades European Union.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:38.943]  This is about globalization and I think that this is the next step in this redistribution of how the global economy works.
[00:14:38.963 --> 00:14:39.183]  Yes?
[00:14:40.884 --> 00:14:50.388]  Well, let's look at the challenge, you know, whether it's what I'll just call a metaphor for the people running the economy globally.
[00:14:50.408 --> 00:14:53.489]  So, whether you're Mr. Global or whether you're
[00:14:54.386 --> 00:14:59.169]  You know, you're Jason and Catherine and the people listening to this call.
[00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:21.265]  The question is, how do we go from being a world where resources are very much used by the few and not by the many, and a world where we're having incredible damage from growth and population to the environment on the planet,
[00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:27.135]  How do we go to a world where we are living in alignment with each other and with the environment?
[00:15:27.675 --> 00:15:32.399]  So how do we go from an unhealthy model to a much more healthy model?
[00:15:32.839 --> 00:15:34.400]  And here's the challenge.
[00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:44.647]  The question is, how do you incentivize people to do what's good for the environment and do what's much more equitable in terms of sharing of resources?
[00:15:45.388 --> 00:15:48.190]  And there are positive systems you can use to do that.
[00:15:50.069 --> 00:16:00.136]  The Solari model says, okay, why don't we finance communities with equity and then people can make money and get financial wealth from reducing consumption.
[00:16:00.856 --> 00:16:06.200]  The notion that we need consumption to grow to get the stock market to go up is absurd.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.261]  That's the corporate model.
[00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:18.709]  But in fact, if you finance places with equity, there's enormous financial incentives for all of us to dramatically reduce our consumption in a way that aligns us and our finances with
[00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:20.646]  With the environment.
[00:16:21.567 --> 00:16:24.089]  Cap and Trade is a very different kind of system.
[00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:25.550]  It's a taxation system.
[00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.893]  And it says, you know, you can't trust people to do the right thing.
[00:16:29.913 --> 00:16:39.620]  So rather than incentivize them with positive, what we're going to do is we're just going to make it very painful and expensive for them to not lower their footprint.
[00:16:40.021 --> 00:16:45.225]  But we're going to do it in a way that, one, gives us central control, and two, where we can game the system.
[00:16:45.325 --> 00:16:46.746]  So I've always said, if you think
[00:16:47.438 --> 00:16:52.262]  You know, that cap-and-trade would make derivatives look like it was something that Mother Teresa came up with.
[00:16:53.763 --> 00:17:06.855]  Because what you're seeing in cap-and-trade is the worst polluters on the planet being given a get-out-of-jail-free card in exchange for making it much more expensive for the least polluting people.
[00:17:07.515 --> 00:17:08.937]  So, for example, Democracy Now!
[00:17:08.977 --> 00:17:13.320]  just had a great description about a month ago of General Motors
[00:17:14.557 --> 00:17:37.687]  Purchasing of carbon credits in Brazil and basically, you know, General Motors is free to pollute Because because the folks in in Brazil can no longer hunt or do all sorts of things with land that they've been using for generations So so you literally have a system that allows the most polluting to to continue to pollute and and get a get out of jail free card and
[00:17:38.109 --> 00:17:41.111]  By making life miserable for the people who have the lowest footprint.
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:27.189]  75 cents or a dollar and then the left cover is oh you must work for the oil industry that's why you're against cap-and-trade that's why again you're against the carbon tax yet these headlines I have next to me out of Bloomberg shell calls for global expansion of cap-and-trade co2 programs and then we have an Exxon executive calling for the same things these are the people that are actually behind this carbon tax system well let's talk about what we need the first thing
[00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:37.538]  That we need, whether it's, you know, if you're the American people or you're in Latin America or any continent around the world, what we all need is transparency about what's going on.
[00:18:37.558 --> 00:18:45.745]  What ClimateGate shows is that the quote-unquote science around the need to have any kind of system is bogus.
[00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:55.053]  And, you know, it's very hard for most people to believe that the concept of global warming could get this far.
[00:18:55.825 --> 00:18:58.827]  And we have this kind of sort of bogus science going on.
[00:18:59.628 --> 00:19:06.374]  And so the first thing that's needed, Jason, is transparency about where is climate change coming from?
[00:19:07.034 --> 00:19:07.474]  Why?
[00:19:07.695 --> 00:19:09.496]  And what are the things that we can do?
[00:19:09.516 --> 00:19:15.781]  You know, what does the human race control that we can change that can improve our circumstances for whatever reason?
[00:19:16.302 --> 00:19:21.706]  And I think that, you know, I'm someone who spends a huge amount of time trying to understand what's happening and why.
[00:19:22.446 --> 00:19:35.451]  And I still feel absolutely no confidence that I know why or can explain why climate change is happening because I think there's so much disinformation.
[00:19:36.067 --> 00:19:47.434]  And it's a perfect example of how disinformation is used to bring about bad policy and control, when what we need is a real, honest conversation about what's going to happen and what can we do.
[00:19:47.814 --> 00:19:58.500]  Well, the bottom line is, if the data said what they said it showed, they wouldn't have destroyed it, and they would have allowed it to be peer-reviewed unless... except for, you know, they didn't, and they had it fall into the dark abyss.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.621]  It's the Alex Jones Show, back...
[00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:01.688]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:20:02.228 --> 00:20:04.290]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.652]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[00:20:08.192 --> 00:20:12.415]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[00:20:12.955 --> 00:20:18.119]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:22.943]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:29.248]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[00:20:29.648 --> 00:20:30.909]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[00:20:31.309 --> 00:20:34.712]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier.
[00:20:34.952 --> 00:20:35.212]  Thank you.
[00:20:59.545 --> 00:21:01.586]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:01.746 --> 00:21:02.526]  Spy on me?
[00:21:02.586 --> 00:21:02.886]  Yeah.
[00:21:02.906 --> 00:21:07.808]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:07.948 --> 00:21:09.408]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:09.588 --> 00:21:10.208]  Startpage?
[00:21:10.328 --> 00:21:10.669]  Yeah.
[00:21:10.749 --> 00:21:11.729]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:11.829 --> 00:21:14.650]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.531]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:21.472]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:21.812 --> 00:21:24.153]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:24.433 --> 00:21:25.914]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:26.014 --> 00:21:26.234]  Right!
[00:21:26.314 --> 00:21:29.316]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:30.157]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:30.197 --> 00:21:31.157]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:35.099]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:39.041]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[00:21:39.202 --> 00:21:44.164]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:47.286]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[00:21:47.746 --> 00:21:49.287]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[00:21:49.487 --> 00:21:53.410]  Try StartPage.com for 7 days and start protecting your privacy.
[00:21:53.791 --> 00:21:55.392]  That's StartPage.com
[00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:05.584]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:06.044 --> 00:22:13.807]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.147 --> 00:22:22.031]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:22.331 --> 00:22:27.073]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:27.413 --> 00:22:32.157]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:32.637 --> 00:22:36.500]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.001]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:38.061 --> 00:22:42.164]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:22:47.488 --> 00:22:50.050]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:22:55.295 --> 00:22:55.556]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.247 --> 00:23:01.148]  Is your computer running slowly?
[00:23:01.408 --> 00:23:02.848]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[00:23:03.168 --> 00:23:04.229]  Don't waste your money!
[00:23:04.369 --> 00:23:10.511]  Your computer could be infected with spyware, malware, viruses, registry errors, spam, and pop-ups.
[00:23:10.671 --> 00:23:12.111]  You don't need to buy a new computer.

[00:24:11.288 --> 00:24:18.977]  She's called the current economic situation a financial coup d'etat.
[00:24:19.037 --> 00:24:20.098]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:20.178 --> 00:24:22.061]  I'm Jason Burmess, sitting in.
[00:24:23.951 --> 00:24:45.298]  I want to move on to what's going on in Copenhagen in just I think it's six or seven days it begins this Copenhagen treaty where one of the quote-unquote three pillars is global government and the term taxation and tax appears over a dozen times they're trying to get this cap and trade scheme
[00:24:46.431 --> 00:24:46.991]  Global!
[00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:55.434]  I mean all the way around so that we sign on to a treaty and of course the United States is the quote-unquote worst polluter so we're going to be hit the hardest.
[00:24:55.734 --> 00:24:59.316]  What do you see coming out of this climate treaty, this meeting?
[00:24:59.776 --> 00:25:14.061]  I don't know what's going to come out of Copenhagen because I think there's a real effort going on behind the scenes to make sure that the United States doesn't commit or commits as little as possible and we don't know how it's going to play out.
[00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:38.230]  The question behind all of this really goes back to, are we going to have a democracy, or are we going to be part of a system where invisible forces control top-down through these unbelievably complex systems, a lot of which are being engineered by using the environmental issues and the environmental community.
[00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.993]  I think in many respects they're unknowing about it.
[00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.952]  You know, I don't know what's going to come out, Jason.
[00:25:46.972 --> 00:26:01.561]  I think we just have to wait to see, but it's part of a long-term trend to try and engineer top-down control in a way that literally takes any kind of accountability out of the hands of the people who live in a place.
[00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:09.726]  So if you live in a county in the United States, and the United States breaks down to just about 3,100 counties, who's in control in that county?
[00:26:09.906 --> 00:26:11.687]  Is it the World Trade Organization?
[00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:15.140]  Is it rule set in a place like Copenhagen?
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.485]  Is it the federal government or is it your local sheriff and town council?
[00:26:21.386 --> 00:26:24.048]  And that's where the rubber's going to meet the road.
[00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:27.772]  If you're a farmer, do you own and control the water on your property?
[00:26:27.812 --> 00:26:33.398]  Or does somebody at the World Trade Organization determine what happens with it?
[00:26:34.853 --> 00:26:37.554]  So where do you see all this going in the United States?
[00:26:37.674 --> 00:26:40.776]  What are we going to look like in six months, in a year?
[00:26:41.096 --> 00:26:43.117]  Is the dollar going to continue to decline?
[00:26:43.177 --> 00:26:44.878]  Is gold going to continue to go up?
[00:26:45.118 --> 00:26:55.303]  And then how can people really hedge their bets and protect themselves from this really economic takeover to the tune of an admitted over 27 trillion dollars in bailouts?
[00:26:56.143 --> 00:26:58.824]  Well, the first thing you want to do is, you know,
[00:27:00.672 --> 00:27:03.653]  I'm not a prophet, so there are many different things that can happen.
[00:27:03.673 --> 00:27:05.594]  There are many different scenarios that can play out.
[00:27:06.135 --> 00:27:13.378]  But the one thing we do know is that there are certain long-term trends, and what you want to do is make sure you align yourself with the long-term trends.
[00:27:13.418 --> 00:27:24.143]  So, the first long-term trend is we're having a shift of resources out of financial assets and what I call sort of bubble economics and into real things.
[00:27:24.887 --> 00:27:30.553]  And what that means is we need to, the average person, the average household needs to demonetize.
[00:27:31.173 --> 00:27:38.761]  So, for example, I once had a friend who was constantly complaining about how the yields in her stock market portfolio were falling and her water bill was going up.
[00:27:38.781 --> 00:27:41.023]  And I said, well, you know, this is really easy.
[00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:43.366]  Why don't you just sell some stock and build a well?
[00:27:45.166 --> 00:27:57.974]  And so that's a perfect example where we put our money into corporate securities and then we get a yield on our corporate securities and then we go into the market and buy from those same corporations the goods and services that we need.
[00:27:58.014 --> 00:28:09.601]  So we've been intermediated and demonetization is really about saying, okay, where can I start investing my time and my resources so that I permanently lower my overhead
[00:28:10.276 --> 00:28:15.479]  Because it makes sense to go back to the way my great grandparents did it.
[00:28:15.879 --> 00:28:18.981]  The economics are changing because we're in a bull market for tangibles.
[00:28:19.701 --> 00:28:29.706]  So, for example, the more I can reduce my dependency in terms of my energy, my food, on unreliable players.
[00:28:29.746 --> 00:28:32.087]  You want to get unreliable players out of your life.
[00:28:32.848 --> 00:28:36.850]  So, one of the questions I always ask people is,
[00:28:37.927 --> 00:28:38.988]  Who's your farmer?
[00:28:39.068 --> 00:28:39.968]  Who's your banker?
[00:28:40.008 --> 00:28:40.889]  Where's your money?
[00:28:42.189 --> 00:28:58.757]  With genetically modified food, there's a reason we all want to start getting to know our farmers again and finding ways of, you know, maybe investing in farmland that help make sure you have, you know, a wonderful supply of food.
[00:29:00.098 --> 00:29:03.119]  You know, so demonetization about that.
[00:29:03.179 --> 00:29:04.140]  The second thing is
[00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:12.513]  Where are you putting your money and how does that relate to making sure you're advantaged?
[00:29:12.653 --> 00:29:16.415]  I always give the example of three women.
[00:29:16.435 --> 00:29:29.600]  I was sitting with a group of three women who were very close friends and I got them talking about how their money worked and what we discovered is that one had her money in a local bank that was sending their money into their correspondent bank in New York.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.022]  It was a large New York bank and they were getting about 4% at the time.
[00:29:35.174 --> 00:29:38.056]  On their money, and when we come back, I'll finish the story.
[00:29:38.497 --> 00:29:39.097]  Sounds good.
[00:29:39.137 --> 00:29:40.918]  We're with Kathryn Austin-Fitz.
[00:29:40.998 --> 00:29:41.979]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:42.059 --> 00:29:43.780]  I'm Jason Vermas, sitting in.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:49.565]  Go check out all of our films, all of our programs over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:50.065 --> 00:29:50.966]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.466 --> 00:29:53.067]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.087 --> 00:29:56.670]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.876 --> 00:30:04.500]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.903]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.123 --> 00:30:12.908]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:30:12.928 --> 00:30:19.174]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:19.314 --> 00:30:21.577]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.057 --> 00:30:22.377]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:22.397 --> 00:30:22.818]  Bernanke?
[00:30:22.898 --> 00:30:23.518]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:23.578 --> 00:30:24.839]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:27.101]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:42.831]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:30:43.131 --> 00:30:47.953]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:48.273 --> 00:30:57.376]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:00.063 --> 00:31:02.664]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.084 --> 00:31:08.045]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:08.405 --> 00:31:10.146]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:10.446 --> 00:31:15.267]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:15.447 --> 00:31:16.408]  How much do you want?
[00:31:16.628 --> 00:31:17.368]  When do you want it?
[00:31:17.748 --> 00:31:19.348]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:19.649 --> 00:31:20.469]  When will you need it?
[00:31:20.709 --> 00:31:22.789]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:24.030]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.590]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:30.851]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.051 --> 00:31:34.232]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:34.632 --> 00:31:38.093]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:38.453 --> 00:31:39.434]  How much will you need?
[00:31:39.674 --> 00:31:40.294]  We don't know.
[00:31:40.575 --> 00:31:41.475]  How much do you want?
[00:31:41.675 --> 00:31:42.416]  All you can get.
[00:31:42.616 --> 00:31:43.457]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:07.782]  We are back live.
[00:33:07.822 --> 00:33:08.943]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.963 --> 00:33:10.663]  We have Kathryn Austin Fitts with us.
[00:33:10.744 --> 00:33:12.685]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting.
[00:33:12.705 --> 00:33:18.728]  And before we go back to her, I want to remind people that there are holiday specials up over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:33:18.748 --> 00:33:21.970]  You can get an entire year subscription to PrisonPlanet.TV.

[00:33:34.656 --> 00:33:34.857]  Only $5.
[00:33:35.917 --> 00:33:36.557]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:34:04.744 --> 00:34:07.626]  So these three women were sitting around, all good friends.
[00:34:07.886 --> 00:34:13.629]  One had her money in a local bank that was shipping its money to the correspondent's large New York bank.
[00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:16.651]  She was getting about 4% on her money at the time.
[00:34:16.871 --> 00:34:17.851]  Yields were much higher.
[00:34:18.452 --> 00:34:29.618]  The second woman had her 401k IRA, both 401k and IRA, and she had her money in the stock of the same New York bank.
[00:34:30.547 --> 00:34:38.313]  And their third friend, and remember I'm getting them talking about their money, it turns out that their third friend was borrowing on her credit card.
[00:34:38.334 --> 00:34:41.316]  She started a business using her credit card right after that.
[00:34:41.476 --> 00:34:43.898]  It was a credit card of the same New York bank.
[00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:46.860]  The bank jacked the rate up to 23%.
[00:34:46.921 --> 00:34:54.667]  The first two women are making about 5% and providing their capital, their life savings, to this bank.
[00:34:55.207 --> 00:34:57.389]  And one of their best friends is borrowing it back at 23%.
[00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:00.256]  Now, what's wrong with that picture?
[00:35:00.336 --> 00:35:09.679]  Why do we need a bank thousands of miles away, or over a thousand miles away, to get in between three friends in a way that's raking off huge and hideous profits?
[00:35:10.359 --> 00:35:11.659]  Well, that's an opportunity.
[00:35:12.379 --> 00:35:21.021]  And, in fact, there was one website that got started, Prosper.com, which was allowing or set up to help people loan directly to each other.
[00:35:21.041 --> 00:35:23.462]  And, of course, you know the boys shut it down.
[00:35:25.562 --> 00:35:28.503]  So, another question is where is the opportunity
[00:35:29.204 --> 00:35:38.067]  To not be intermediated by the big institutions and find ways of making more money and keeping the cash flow in either our networks or our neighborhood.
[00:35:40.147 --> 00:35:42.048]  Let's say we did everything, Jason.
[00:35:42.328 --> 00:35:48.329]  We demonetized, we bought our generator, we started loaning.
[00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:52.631]  Let's say we did everything we could do just ourselves and our networks.
[00:35:52.691 --> 00:35:57.072]  Then the question comes down to, okay, now how do we start taking political action?
[00:35:58.161 --> 00:36:07.546]  And, um, in addition to who's your farmer and who's your banker, a very important question in the 2010 election is going to be, who's your sheriff?
[00:36:08.487 --> 00:36:22.155]  Because, in fact, if you look at the legal construct upon which the Republic was founded, the most powerful person in your county is not the President of the United States, and it's not even your governor, it's the sheriff.
[00:36:23.195 --> 00:36:25.997]  And literally, the federal government cannot do anything
[00:36:26.736 --> 00:36:31.899]  Outside or against the Constitution, if your sheriff says no, you may not.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.941]  They're the ultimate word within that jurisdiction.
[00:36:35.602 --> 00:36:51.652]  And we're going to have Richard Mack, I don't know if you've ever had Richard Mack on InfoWars, but we're going to have Richard Mack, who's a retired sheriff in Arizona, has written a lot about this question and in fact took the federal government to court, went all the way to the Supreme Court and won.
[00:36:51.672 --> 00:36:54.634]  He's going to be on the Solari Report in January.
[00:36:56.115 --> 00:37:05.250]  So I just cringe when I see people spend money and time on the presidential elections when they're completely ignoring who is their sheriff.
[00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:09.611]  And their political representation in their own local area.
[00:37:09.851 --> 00:37:19.315]  Well, I always tell people that they need to start locally and if they truly do want to change the system, perhaps it's time for them to run for city council or state senator or even a congressional spot.
[00:37:19.355 --> 00:37:23.597]  But of course, the sheriff is a very, very powerful position and an electable one.
[00:37:23.897 --> 00:37:27.858]  So if you don't like what's going on in your county, it's time for you to run for sheriff.
[00:37:28.178 --> 00:37:32.260]  Well, but the other thing is, you know, the sheriffs can do an awful lot if people will support them.
[00:37:32.822 --> 00:37:36.524]  And a lot of the politics comes down to the Fed throws a lot of money.
[00:37:36.564 --> 00:37:44.970]  The more dependent we get on federal money, and the more the Feds control the cash flow locally, the more everybody won't support their sheriff in standing up.
[00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.291]  And that's why it's got to be battled out in the cash flow.
[00:37:47.751 --> 00:37:55.236]  The next place you need to go after who's your sheriff is to look at, okay, let's look at where the governmental money is going.
[00:37:55.276 --> 00:37:58.838]  We're paying taxes, and that tax money is going someplace.
[00:37:58.898 --> 00:38:01.660]  Is that money circulating into the businesses that create
[00:38:02.265 --> 00:38:31.336]  Employment and opportunities for us that we are neighbors own and I just want to use an example of what's been happening because if you look if you dig in and you look at the federal state and local governmental flows all resources not just contracts or expenditures within a place what you discover is there's enormous opportunity to lower the burden to taxpayers in a way that creates much more income locally for us and let me give you a perfect example I live in Tennessee
[00:38:31.983 --> 00:38:40.089]  We have about 20% of the population now on food stamps, a huge part of the federal flow through in the Tennessee state budget.
[00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.292]  It's over a billion dollars now.
[00:38:43.492 --> 00:38:51.798]  So 20% of the people on food stamps in a state where we have fabulous farmland, beautiful farmland that's just sitting, not doing anything.
[00:38:53.179 --> 00:38:58.483]  It turns out, Jason, that we are outsourcing the data servicing and customer support work
[00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:03.991]  On the food stamp contract in Tennessee, it's true in Florida, other states, too.
[00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:04.931]  Are you ready for this?
[00:39:05.091 --> 00:39:06.992]  JPMorgan Chase in India.
[00:39:07.392 --> 00:39:07.972]  Oh, how lovely!
[00:39:08.232 --> 00:39:14.734]  Now, we have counties in Tennessee where we have 25% unemployment.
[00:39:15.014 --> 00:39:28.417]  So, the federal and state governments are paying people to not work and paying for their food stamps when they are also paying JPMorgan Chase to do jobs that these people could do.
[00:39:29.938 --> 00:39:33.740]  Well, that's why those arguments never stand up that, oh, they don't want to take these jobs.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.521]  No, you're not offering them to people.
[00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:39.764]  You're moving them overseas and making it impossible for them to do this work.
[00:39:40.104 --> 00:39:44.226]  Well, in fact, data servicing jobs are wonderful jobs for many people.
[00:39:44.906 --> 00:39:58.034]  If you are someone who has responsibilities for caring for children or for elderly parents or both, data servicing jobs can be beamed in, you know, you can beam them out to lots of different sites locally.
[00:39:59.326 --> 00:40:08.208]  And they can be done in flexible hours, so you can get very high productivity with flexible hours in sites that are closer to home, even residential.
[00:40:08.888 --> 00:40:25.611]  So, in fact, it doesn't make any sense to beam those jobs to India because there is a way to do them here, which is enormously wonderful for a workforce that literally cannot get in a car and commute an hour into Nashville or Knoxville or, you know, Tampa or Orlando.
[00:40:26.195 --> 00:40:36.227]  Because they have to take care of, and it's certainly much more economic for society to have them care for their family members than to try and institutionalize that.
[00:40:36.627 --> 00:40:41.132]  So if you look at the fundamental economics, you'll see again and again, and I saw this,
[00:40:42.159 --> 00:40:56.423]  I served as the Assistant Secretary of Housing, and I would often see communities where we were spending $250,000 per unit to construct public housing, when $50,000 would buy and rehab a single-family home.
[00:40:56.484 --> 00:41:01.325]  So we were paying five times per unit of what we needed to.
[00:41:01.885 --> 00:41:05.246]  And in fact, in the Clinton administration, I took that example.
[00:41:05.266 --> 00:41:10.728]  In fact, it was New Orleans where this situation, the fact pattern, was just outrageous.
[00:41:12.398 --> 00:41:13.718]  I'd first seen it in Chicago.
[00:41:13.758 --> 00:41:21.782]  I took it to the assistant of the person who ran that program at HUD, and I said, look, if we just re-engineered the money, we could get five homes for the price of one.
[00:41:22.303 --> 00:41:26.225]  The person turned bright red and looked at me and said, but how could we generate fees for our friends?
[00:41:27.345 --> 00:41:32.328]  So when there's a bubble going on, Jason, everybody's happy to generate fees for their friends.
[00:41:33.028 --> 00:41:39.692]  You know, when you turn to people and say, your children can't have health care because there's not enough money.
[00:41:40.279 --> 00:42:04.851]  It's time to look at 50 years of accumulated fees for our friends and say, you know, maybe we need to re-engineer how things work, because we've had decades of computers and new technology, and yet the overhead costs of fundamental government projects have skyrocketed exponentially, and that's because we are subsidizing a huge infrastructure
[00:42:05.804 --> 00:42:13.045]  The biggest piece of which is these big corporations, because you give a big corporation a government contract and you drive their stock up.
[00:42:13.065 --> 00:42:19.506]  So there's real, you know, capital gains on stock market real estate is the primary source of political contribution.
[00:42:20.207 --> 00:42:34.789]  And it starts, though, in your own county saying, okay, let me get control of my local representatives, whether it's my sheriff or town council or state representative, make sure we have excellent people in office, but then let's look at the money
[00:42:35.501 --> 00:42:51.848]  And let's look at where we're paying five times of what is needed and where we cannot re-engineer the money to get a much better result in terms of expenses down and income up for the people here in a way that reduces the load to taxpayer.
[00:42:52.248 --> 00:42:55.409]  And I tell you, those opportunities are absolutely there.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:03.842]  We're going to open up the phone lines for Catherine Austin Fitz in just a moment, but first I want to get your take on gold being at a record high today.
[00:43:03.922 --> 00:43:05.303]  Where is the roof on this thing?
[00:43:05.543 --> 00:43:10.584]  Are we going to see it go up above $1,300, $1,400, maybe even hit $1,500?
[00:43:10.924 --> 00:43:13.025]  Where do you see gold and precious metals going?
[00:43:13.945 --> 00:43:25.289]  If you go back and you look at the high in 1980 before the current high, and you say, okay, you know, gold traded at $800.
[00:43:26.753 --> 00:43:29.614]  Even above, but the close was $800.
[00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:33.256]  So gold traded at $800 in 1980.
[00:43:33.916 --> 00:43:44.121]  If we were going to say, okay, how much was that in inflation in just the dollars, because we've had enormous inflation from 1980 until now, so it's almost 30 years of inflation.
[00:43:44.721 --> 00:43:47.542]  But in current dollars, what was that?
[00:43:47.562 --> 00:43:47.542]  $800?
[00:43:48.623 --> 00:43:52.024]  Depending on who calculates it and what series they use.
[00:43:52.064 --> 00:43:53.525]  Do they use a government series or
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.263]  For example, John William's Shadow Stats has redone the government numbers.
[00:43:59.805 --> 00:44:07.291]  So do we use the more reliable numbers like John's for the CPI and the inflation?
[00:44:08.092 --> 00:44:10.374]  What would $800 be in current dollars?
[00:44:10.434 --> 00:44:15.359]  You get estimates of anywhere from $2,500 to $7,500.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.423]  And so what we're looking at today with a price of approximately $1,200,
[00:44:22.003 --> 00:44:25.885]  It's something that is less than 50% of where the high was in 1980.
[00:44:27.166 --> 00:44:31.308]  So on an inflation-adjusted basis, Jason, we're nowhere near the high.
[00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:32.189]  That's number one.
[00:44:32.909 --> 00:44:42.514]  Number two, the challenge we have with precious metals is that it's a very tiny market relative to the global stock or bond markets.
[00:44:42.854 --> 00:44:47.097]  I mean, the global bond market is huge, and then you add derivatives.
[00:44:47.907 --> 00:44:56.795]  If a tiny bit of money decides it wants to shift into precious metals, you're talking about enormous pressure to drive the price up.
[00:44:57.215 --> 00:45:13.910]  Now, we've seen over the last 15 years real intervention by the central banks and government treasuries to drive and manage the price down as really a way to protect the bond market and sort of the inflated values of global currencies, particularly the dollar.
[00:45:15.277 --> 00:45:18.219]  More and more investors are beginning to understand that game.
[00:45:18.539 --> 00:45:27.044]  One of the things that has always threatened the market was the overhang of gold that the IMF has said that it was willing to sell.
[00:45:28.345 --> 00:45:32.588]  The IMF is beginning, instead of just threatening sales, they have approved sales.
[00:45:33.108 --> 00:45:38.532]  But that overhang is going very quickly into central banks, which are snapping it up.
[00:45:39.412 --> 00:45:44.055]  And if you say to yourself, look, if central banks and institutional investors
[00:45:44.705 --> 00:45:48.808]  And retail investors are going to start to move into this very, very thin market.
[00:45:49.529 --> 00:45:55.854]  It doesn't take much incremental change in percentage of market share to drive the price through the roof.
[00:45:55.894 --> 00:46:04.120]  So, the long-term fundamentals on precious metals are very, very strong, number one.
[00:46:04.301 --> 00:46:11.046]  And number two, it is very important to remember that this is an extremely political market.
[00:46:11.658 --> 00:46:16.640]  And a very, you know, there's an economic war going on in the middle of this market.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.321]  So we're looking at prices that are extremely volatile.
[00:46:20.941 --> 00:46:25.763]  And it's very important to recognize, yes, we have a long-term bull market.
[00:46:26.303 --> 00:46:29.244]  My guess is that there is a great distance to go.
[00:46:29.304 --> 00:46:30.685]  This has only just begun.
[00:46:32.045 --> 00:46:36.147]  But you have to be very careful, because in the short term, we're going to get wild swings.
[00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:39.288]  And it's important for a retail investor to not
[00:46:39.949 --> 00:46:45.170]  Do anything in this market where they could get caught by those swings.
[00:46:45.211 --> 00:46:54.093]  So, before anybody sort of tiptoes into these waters, just make sure you understand what you've got going and be prepared to stick in it for the long haul.
[00:46:54.633 --> 00:46:55.914]  Now, when does it end?
[00:46:56.714 --> 00:47:04.576]  One of the things that could end all of this is when a new global currency goes into effect and is really working.
[00:47:05.176 --> 00:47:07.337]  And that will diminish the need for
[00:47:08.931 --> 00:47:13.294]  For using precious metals as sort of a global currency.
[00:47:13.314 --> 00:47:19.017]  This reflects not only that need, but the distrust that everybody has in government.
[00:47:19.738 --> 00:47:26.082]  So, we're really watching a deterioration in the quality of sovereign government credits worldwide.
[00:47:26.142 --> 00:47:28.623]  So, I think this goes on for a long time.
[00:47:28.663 --> 00:47:36.268]  You just want to be really careful because we're talking about something that will price in very volatile ways against your local currency.
[00:47:36.972 --> 00:47:38.155]  Alright, let's go to the phone lines.
[00:47:38.195 --> 00:47:39.880]  Let's go to Betty in Texas.
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:40.622]  Betty, what's on your mind?
[00:47:41.872 --> 00:47:45.313]  Catherine, thank you so much for allowing me to speak to you.
[00:47:45.333 --> 00:47:47.813]  I'm so thrilled with everything that you say.
[00:47:49.134 --> 00:47:54.655]  However, I would like to add in something about the Copenhagen Treaty.
[00:47:55.555 --> 00:48:02.296]  One, Obama still hasn't produced his birth certificate, and he's being sued over that by Phil Berg, I believe.
[00:48:02.916 --> 00:48:09.518]  And two, he cannot sit as the head of the Security Council of the United Nations while he's
[00:48:11.238 --> 00:48:26.250]  being president of the United States and so have you heard anything about whether or not uh... Filberg has filed an injunction to keep Obama from going and signing the Copenhagen Treaty and what do you think about it?
[00:48:27.331 --> 00:48:37.559]  I don't know um... I don't know I'm just ignorant of the status of the lawsuit occasionally you know like anybody I'll read things on the internet but I really
[00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:44.753]  And I don't think there's anything actually going on in regards to the Copenhagen Treaty due to that.
[00:48:44.773 --> 00:48:45.694]  I thank you for the call, Betty.
[00:48:45.734 --> 00:48:47.555]  Let's go to Chris in New Mexico.
[00:48:47.615 --> 00:48:50.176]  Chris, you're on the line.
[00:48:50.196 --> 00:48:50.956]  Thanks, Jason.
[00:48:50.976 --> 00:48:51.557]  Hi, Catherine.
[00:48:52.248 --> 00:48:53.028]  Hi, Jason.
[00:48:54.009 --> 00:48:54.869]  Oh, that was Jason.
[00:48:54.909 --> 00:48:55.349]  I'm Chris.
[00:48:55.889 --> 00:48:56.970]  Oh, I'm sorry, Chris.
[00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:58.650]  Oh, Chris, what do you got for us?
[00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:02.872]  Catherine, nice to hear you in the daytime instead of the middle of the night.
[00:49:03.752 --> 00:49:08.234]  Would you spend a few minutes talking about one of the alternative currencies?
[00:49:08.534 --> 00:49:11.775]  You know, I think that's the only way that we're going to get out of this mess.
[00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:16.797]  Something like along the lines of Ithaca Hours or, you know, some of the others that have been established.
[00:49:16.857 --> 00:49:20.218]  And I know you know a little bit about that, so can you address that?
[00:49:21.312 --> 00:49:29.080]  Sure, I think there are a number of ways that we can start to transact both locally and in our networks.
[00:49:29.881 --> 00:49:39.370]  And the important thing to understand is it needs to be built in a very granular way which gives energy to the people in the short term within a community.
[00:49:40.151 --> 00:49:43.594]  One of the challenges of community currencies is that
[00:49:45.424 --> 00:49:51.788]  If you organize them as a sort of new legal structure and make them complicated, they can be very expensive and time-consuming.
[00:49:52.288 --> 00:49:57.491]  And I'm a believer in the just-do-it method, and I would look at several things.
[00:49:57.671 --> 00:50:03.594]  One is the idea of using your gold and silver coins as just a medium of exchange.
[00:50:03.755 --> 00:50:08.037]  If you go to our website at solari.com, Franklin Sanders of the Money Changer and I,
[00:50:08.735 --> 00:50:09.076]  I think?
[00:50:25.484 --> 00:50:32.449]  You can use the calculator to very quickly calculate in silver and gold coins what it would take to pay that amount.
[00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:40.914]  So, the first thing, I'm going to suggest three things, but the first is just start using your gold and silver coins to transact.
[00:50:40.934 --> 00:50:41.614]  Just do it.
[00:50:42.515 --> 00:50:44.736]  Let's talk about those other two things on the other side.
[00:50:44.776 --> 00:50:46.277]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:46.317 --> 00:50:47.958]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[00:50:48.019 --> 00:50:52.121]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlan.tv, and Catherine's website, Solari.com.
[00:50:52.141 --> 00:50:52.681]  S-O-L-A-R-I.com.
[00:51:00.427 --> 00:51:00.927]  Attention!
[00:51:01.107 --> 00:51:16.171]  An important product from hempusa.org, Micro Plant Powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[00:51:16.451 --> 00:51:17.872]  Micro Plant Powder is 89% silica.
[00:51:19.312 --> 00:51:19.672]  I think so.
[00:51:44.718 --> 00:51:47.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.722]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:49.782 --> 00:51:51.343]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.323]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.063 --> 00:52:19.569]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:19.709 --> 00:52:24.733]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.254 --> 00:52:34.883]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.003 --> 00:52:37.104]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:37.344 --> 00:52:38.665]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:38.925 --> 00:52:41.206]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.386 --> 00:52:43.226]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:43.507 --> 00:52:48.329]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:48.669 --> 00:52:58.593]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:00.133 --> 00:53:01.354]  Studies have shown that many people
[00:53:07.045 --> 00:53:07.506]  We're good.
[00:53:22.128 --> 00:53:23.749]  We're good to go.
[00:53:43.635 --> 00:53:43.895]  I don't know.
[00:54:09.105 --> 00:54:11.226]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:11.266 --> 00:54:12.646]  He's out on assignment in Dallas.
[00:54:12.666 --> 00:54:14.347]  I'm Jason Burmess, sitting in.
[00:54:14.367 --> 00:54:20.169]  If you missed any of the program, remember, following the broadcast, the podcast is available at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:20.269 --> 00:54:29.092]  Three great guests today, Jim O'Neill, Gary Lachman, Catherine Austin-Bitts, and of course, Alex Jones joined us for the better part of an hour.
[00:54:29.513 --> 00:54:33.114]  Catherine, you were just talking about what currencies you could get into.
[00:54:33.194 --> 00:54:38.796]  You said, you know, use your silver and gold coins as currencies, but you had two other points you wanted to make.
[00:54:39.156 --> 00:54:43.940]  Sure, and this is the, you know, how do we start currencies by the Just Do It method.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.442]  The second is, there's a wonderful association called IRDA.
[00:54:47.502 --> 00:54:51.585]  It's the International Association Related to Barter Networks.
[00:54:52.385 --> 00:54:59.571]  In your community, it is likely that you already have a barter network set up that could use some support.
[00:54:59.871 --> 00:55:06.816]  And there is a great deal that can be done through barter networks, both locally and their network globally.
[00:55:06.876 --> 00:55:08.657]  So, you know, you can end up getting your
[00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:15.973]  Your tour package to Scotland for the holidays through your local barter network.
[00:55:16.033 --> 00:55:24.682]  So check out the IRTA website and find the local barter network or networks in your place and start to see if there aren't ways you can use it.
[00:55:24.722 --> 00:55:29.207]  A lot of times you'll find businesses report as much as a 10% increase in sales
[00:55:30.957 --> 00:55:33.939]  Uh, that come about by their use of barter.
[00:55:34.039 --> 00:55:39.582]  So, there's a lot of opportunities, but we need to start, just build from the infrastructure that's there.
[00:55:40.222 --> 00:55:50.708]  Finally, there's, um, there's a real opportunity, as Chris said, to, to explore, uh, exchanging or trading or using hours.
[00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:56.171]  Um, just using hours among neighbors and friends and businesses.
[00:55:56.727 --> 00:56:04.830]  But then going to a more formal system of trading our time and trading hours that makes an awful lot of sense to explore.
[00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:14.473]  It starts with really talking to other people in your community, whether it's your neighbor or other small businesses, about how you can help each other save time or lower your expenses.
[00:56:15.033 --> 00:56:19.515]  So it really starts with socializing and communication and just exploring the ideas.
[00:56:20.155 --> 00:56:23.796]  If you can start to have more reciprocal relationships and connections,
[00:56:24.352 --> 00:56:30.193]  Then you can move to a system of early trading hours, and there's lots of information on the website.
[00:56:30.233 --> 00:56:39.715]  Now, I will say one of the most interesting statistics, Jason, is during the Great Depression, there were over 3200 local currencies in America.
[00:56:39.735 --> 00:56:42.496]  Do you think there'll be a revival in that?
[00:56:42.536 --> 00:56:43.696]  There are only 3100 counties.
[00:56:44.396 --> 00:56:48.978]  So, this is something that we're going to return and be doing this again.
[00:56:51.457 --> 00:57:03.740]  And so it absolutely makes sense to spend time, but start with what you know, whether it's your gold and silver coins, barter networks in your community, just getting to know more people in your neighborhood and seeing where you can't trade time.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:09.581]  You know, just where I live in a very rural community, so we're always offering to help each other.
[00:57:09.621 --> 00:57:11.761]  I'm going into town, what can I pick up for you?
[00:57:12.921 --> 00:57:15.502]  Alright, final caller, Noel in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:57:16.471 --> 00:57:22.054]  Yes, hi Jason, Fable Enemies was unbelievable, and I have a quick question in terms of the ClimateGate scandal.
[00:57:23.494 --> 00:57:28.577]  As any of you guys talked about, there's a newsletter from Earth Government, March 27, 2003, which talks about how
[00:57:31.573 --> 00:57:37.579]  We needed an earth government in terms of a one world government to help ease CO2 emissions.
[00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:50.750]  We're good to go.
[00:58:41.508 --> 00:58:43.389]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.754 --> 00:58:54.937]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:55.077 --> 00:58:56.979]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:58:57.159 --> 00:58:59.440]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:58:59.601 --> 00:59:01.442]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:01.882 --> 00:59:03.223]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:03.503 --> 00:59:04.544]  There is a solution.
[00:59:04.764 --> 00:59:12.791]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:00:22.355 --> 01:00:25.698]  It's normally a full interview, but Alan's got so much to say and I've got so much to add.
[01:00:26.238 --> 01:00:29.501]  We're getting back on for a couple hours early in January.
[01:00:29.521 --> 01:00:32.743]  In fact, let's make sure we set that up with him and his calendar before he leaves us.
[01:00:33.224 --> 01:00:35.986]  He is a big part of Fall of the Republic.
[01:00:36.426 --> 01:00:41.752]  The presidency of Barack H. Obama detailing the global government banking slash carbon tax takeover.
[01:00:42.573 --> 01:00:44.675]  This film couldn't have come out at a better time.
[01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.978]  It is exploding like no film I've ever produced.

[01:01:18.654 --> 01:01:23.757]  First off, I haven't talked to you since we got you a copy of it when the guys came to interview you a few months ago in Canada.
[01:01:24.338 --> 01:01:27.159]  What's your take on Fall of the Republic, Alan?
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.420]  It's having a great impact.
[01:01:29.521 --> 01:01:31.081]  It's all over the planet now.
[01:01:31.942 --> 01:01:36.184]  And I get emails from so many people saying they've seen it.
[01:01:36.204 --> 01:01:39.446]  And it's hitting them between the eyes, some of them.
[01:01:40.127 --> 01:01:43.989]  Which is a darn good thing, because we have more time to lose here than catching up.
[01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:46.110]  We're going to be shocked into reality.
[01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.531]  And I think it helps to do that.
[01:01:48.351 --> 01:01:50.032]  What do you think of the film yourself?
[01:01:50.052 --> 01:01:51.373]  I mean, I want your honest review.
[01:01:51.973 --> 01:01:52.773]  Oh, it's well done.
[01:01:52.793 --> 01:01:53.514]  It's well done.
[01:01:53.594 --> 01:02:00.437]  I mean, even the camera guys, when they were here doing the take, they knew their stuff as well.
[01:02:00.477 --> 01:02:01.718]  I think it was well on.
[01:02:02.538 --> 01:02:16.965]  And I don't know who did the editing and so on, but they certainly did a good job of patching all the different pieces together to make it flow and keep the topics flowing so that people who didn't know too much could get an understanding and take them right through it.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:36.396]  In a condensed form, and that's what we have to do today because we cannot give a complete lifetime's education to people in a fast move except by condensing it for them and giving them important parts and really stressing how it's done and where it is going if they don't participate in their own future.
[01:02:37.586 --> 01:02:42.292]  Yeah, I mean, we're showing people, here's the globalist agenda, here's their own documents, here's their own statements.
[01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:44.955]  Do you want this for yourself and your future?
[01:02:44.975 --> 01:02:48.199]  Do you want to be a slave who is eventually euthanized?
[01:02:49.621 --> 01:02:50.863]  The decision is up to you.
[01:02:51.203 --> 01:02:53.947]  One of the few criticisms I've gotten for Follow the Republic
[01:02:55.379 --> 01:02:59.801]  Is, well, I already knew a lot of this, or this has a lot of basics in it.
[01:03:00.341 --> 01:03:18.108]  Yes, that's the whole point of the Obama deception in Fall of the Republic, is to be slickly done, well produced, highest level graphics, and it has a lot of new information as well, but yes, it gives people the basics, because we're trying to reach people who have no idea of what's going on.
[01:03:19.333 --> 01:03:36.544]  And plus, when you get people together who know, with people who don't know, rather than just go over stuff through books and weekly meetings, if you've all shared the same video and then discussed it yourself and chipped in, it's a good way to catch up quickly, to speak as to what's happening.
[01:03:36.844 --> 01:03:40.607]  You could have something in common, and something you've all either seen or read in common.
[01:03:41.747 --> 01:03:43.048]  And that's how it's done today.
[01:03:43.088 --> 01:03:46.410]  We don't have time to give a history for the last hundred odd years.
[01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:47.471]  We don't have time.
[01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:58.105]  So you have to condense it to an important part so that the beginners can understand and bring them up to speed so they can then converse with you with the knowledge that you're sharing.
[01:03:59.045 --> 01:04:04.567]  And then once they have a basic blueprint of just part of the system, it's too complex to give somebody the full view.
[01:04:04.587 --> 01:04:06.048]  I mean, I'm still learning every day.
[01:04:06.088 --> 01:04:11.810]  It's so big and complex and they've had so many specials working for so long on different parts of this matrix system.
[01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:26.362]  But once people have a basic snapshot, a basic crash course in brain surgery, then they can start picking up the other rabbit trails and larger gestalts for themselves as their palate develops.
[01:04:27.082 --> 01:04:27.583]  That's correct.
[01:04:27.603 --> 01:04:30.085]  You understand the break up against organization.
[01:04:30.845 --> 01:04:44.117]  The organisation has been working steadily for well over a hundred years with non-governmental organisations who are trained in a school-type format, gradually updated with their vision of the future.
[01:04:44.538 --> 01:04:53.266]  As I say, they're organised, they're funded, some of them are full-time employees, in fact they get salaries from the big foundations and pension funds.
[01:04:53.926 --> 01:04:54.807]  That's what we're up against.
[01:04:54.987 --> 01:04:56.128]  Massive organizations.
[01:04:56.629 --> 01:04:59.551]  We have to do with what we have.
[01:04:59.751 --> 01:05:03.995]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.295 --> 01:05:04.916]  Number one.
[01:05:05.216 --> 01:05:08.379]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.639 --> 01:05:09.120]  Number two.
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:14.041]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.381 --> 01:05:14.841]  It's true.
[01:05:15.121 --> 01:05:19.682]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:20.543]  Number 3.
[01:05:20.823 --> 01:05:24.103]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.403 --> 01:05:28.104]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:28.864]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.104 --> 01:05:31.505]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.865 --> 01:05:35.286]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:35.546 --> 01:05:35.766]  Number 5.
[01:05:36.326 --> 01:05:40.269]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:45.253]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:45.534 --> 01:05:49.577]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.717 --> 01:05:51.298]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:51.499 --> 01:05:56.102]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:00.233 --> 01:06:02.836]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:03.236 --> 01:06:08.201]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:08.581 --> 01:06:10.323]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:10.623 --> 01:06:15.448]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:15.628 --> 01:06:16.549]  How much do you want?
[01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:17.550]  When do you want it?
[01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:19.531]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:19.812 --> 01:06:20.632]  When will you need it?
[01:06:20.872 --> 01:06:22.934]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.074 --> 01:06:24.195]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:24.415 --> 01:06:25.756]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:25.957 --> 01:06:31.021]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:31.221 --> 01:06:34.404]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:34.804 --> 01:06:38.267]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:38.607 --> 01:06:39.608]  How much will you need?
[01:06:39.848 --> 01:06:40.449]  We don't know.
[01:06:40.749 --> 01:06:41.650]  How much do you want?
[01:06:41.851 --> 01:06:42.591]  All you can get.
[01:06:42.772 --> 01:06:43.633]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.873 --> 01:06:46.636]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.678]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:48.698 --> 01:06:49.619]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:59.286 --> 01:07:04.453]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:07:04.593 --> 01:07:06.536]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:08.999]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:07:09.119 --> 01:07:10.982]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:12.764]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:07:13.024 --> 01:07:14.046]  There is a solution.
[01:07:14.266 --> 01:07:22.293]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:07:22.713 --> 01:07:29.779]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:07:30.159 --> 01:07:35.824]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:07:36.184 --> 01:07:41.768]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:07:42.208 --> 01:07:46.011]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:07:46.371 --> 01:07:52.555]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[01:07:52.875 --> 01:07:57.138]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:08:06.346 --> 01:08:06.967]  Big Brother.
[01:08:07.647 --> 01:08:08.689]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:09.409 --> 01:08:10.550]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:11.992]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.753 --> 01:08:13.634]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:17.918]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.498 --> 01:08:22.623]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:35.868 --> 01:08:37.169]  UPS can normally ship anywhere in the U.S.
[01:08:37.209 --> 01:08:37.549]  in four days.
[01:08:37.569 --> 01:08:39.189]  They say six working days out from Christmas, so tomorrow.
[01:08:39.209 --> 01:08:42.331]  Orders that get in today and tomorrow are guaranteed by UPS
[01:09:03.929 --> 01:09:06.210]  Anywhere in the United States before Christmas.
[01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:09.991]  Now, most places it's two or three days.
[01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:12.511]  But that's how we ship UPS.
[01:09:12.992 --> 01:09:18.293]  If people want regular mail, you can always order that way too, but we found UPS is... I mean, the U.S.
[01:09:18.333 --> 01:09:19.513]  mail is really bad.
[01:09:20.074 --> 01:09:23.515]  I've seen a bunch of reports about mail offices just throw your mail away now.
[01:09:23.555 --> 01:09:24.515]  They just don't even care.
[01:09:24.915 --> 01:09:28.196]  Pension checks, toys... It's the government!
[01:09:29.221 --> 01:09:30.883]  And if you don't like it, a SWAT team will drop by.
[01:09:31.383 --> 01:09:35.487]  I mean, you know, they got the SWAT teams, they got your tax money, that's... I don't want to bash the whole post office.
[01:09:35.507 --> 01:09:36.808]  There's some great people at the post office.
[01:09:37.529 --> 01:09:49.100]  The point is, if you want to order Fall of the Republic and get a free endgame, or if you want to order Fall of the Republic and get a free Reflections and Warnings, come on in, Weldon.
[01:09:50.281 --> 01:09:51.042]  Weldon is down here.
[01:09:51.082 --> 01:09:52.524]  I was trying to get him down here earlier.
[01:09:52.784 --> 01:09:53.344]  Real fast,
[01:09:54.682 --> 01:10:02.966]  So if their order gets in today or tomorrow, you guys can get it out by the next day, and then UPS guarantees it will get there before Christmas?
[01:10:03.507 --> 01:10:04.527]  It'll get there before Christmas.
[01:10:04.807 --> 01:10:11.371]  If you place your order before 8 o'clock tomorrow morning, you'll get it before Christmas, guaranteed.
[01:10:12.071 --> 01:10:13.512]  Oh, so it's 8 o'clock tomorrow morning?
[01:10:13.532 --> 01:10:13.692]  Yes.
[01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:15.773]  Because you guys want to get everything out tomorrow?
[01:10:16.741 --> 01:10:17.922]  Well, and everything will be out.
[01:10:17.942 --> 01:10:19.903]  If you order today, even, it'll be out today.
[01:10:20.544 --> 01:10:23.946]  And, uh, but we feel like, you know, we'll be able to do it tomorrow, too, so.
[01:10:24.086 --> 01:10:27.849]  Now, wow, we used to, we were a week or two behind on shipping until we got Weldon.
[01:10:28.169 --> 01:10:30.951]  Now we're shipping a lot of times on the day it comes in.
[01:10:31.331 --> 01:10:33.252]  We're up right now to day, yeah.
[01:10:33.753 --> 01:10:36.995]  Anybody that places their order, uh, this morning, it's going out today, so.
[01:10:37.936 --> 01:10:38.396]  Well, that's good.
[01:10:38.416 --> 01:10:42.679]  There's gonna be a lot of little evil elves climbing down chimneys, bringing people DVDs.
[01:10:42.699 --> 01:10:43.679]  That's right.
[01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:48.331]  Are you guys wearing elf hats back there?
[01:10:49.171 --> 01:10:49.691]  Uh, not yet.
[01:10:49.711 --> 01:10:50.652]  Well, I'll make them wear that.
[01:10:50.712 --> 01:10:52.672]  Hey, the public believes polar bears can't swim.
[01:10:53.032 --> 01:10:54.413]  Why not say elves exist?
[01:10:55.173 --> 01:10:55.633]  There you go.
[01:10:56.094 --> 01:10:56.414]  Why not?
[01:10:57.594 --> 01:10:58.875]  Maybe Al Gore's Santa Claus.
[01:11:00.695 --> 01:11:01.936]  Oh, that'll be interesting to see.
[01:11:01.976 --> 01:11:03.836]  He's not gonna like this present.
[01:11:04.057 --> 01:11:04.297]  Uh-uh.
[01:11:04.517 --> 01:11:05.397]  That's the one he won't like.
[01:11:06.457 --> 01:11:10.479]  Again, free t-shirts right now that you can pick from when you get Fall of the Republic.
[01:11:10.539 --> 01:11:11.859]  I just want people to have this.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:14.060]  That's right.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:14.841]  We'll get them to him.
[01:11:14.901 --> 01:11:15.861]  Now, a lot of UPS
[01:11:16.738 --> 01:11:21.580]  Stuff shipping out even by this Friday will still get to most people around the country, right?
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.140]  Yeah, most people it will.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.501]  Most locations it takes, you know, three business days.
[01:11:27.221 --> 01:11:30.462]  We just set the deadline to make sure that they covered everybody.
[01:11:31.743 --> 01:11:35.264]  So, I mean, folks even at order, majority of folks at order even on
[01:11:35.805 --> 01:11:38.426]  All day tomorrow or Friday morning we'll still probably get it.
[01:11:38.826 --> 01:11:40.206]  But we just can't guarantee it.
[01:11:40.407 --> 01:11:43.528]  So guaranteed to get it if you order by 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.
[01:11:44.088 --> 01:11:46.929]  Good chance you're still going to get it if you order by Friday.
[01:11:47.129 --> 01:11:48.729]  Good, we should have been plugging that all week.
[01:11:48.809 --> 01:11:52.750]  And of course you can always get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and share it as a gift with others.
[01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:54.991]  Weldon, thank you so much for coming in and talking to us.
[01:11:55.491 --> 01:11:56.152]  Good job there.
[01:11:56.532 --> 01:11:58.652]  Okay, I'm going to shut up now and go back to Alan Watt.
[01:11:59.133 --> 01:12:01.593]  Alan Watt, enough with Christmas and Fall of the Republic.
[01:12:02.754 --> 01:12:03.494]  We have total
[01:12:04.674 --> 01:12:06.795]  Mind control being established in the country.
[01:12:07.575 --> 01:12:15.078]  We have all over the United States, Europe, the Western world, children on record writing reports on their parents.
[01:12:15.118 --> 01:12:26.863]  We confirmed that the Perdenales Power Authority in Texas, Central Texas, is making the kids fill out dossiers on their parents through the public schools or they get a zero on their grade.
[01:12:27.644 --> 01:12:30.545]  I have a report here where a boy drew an image of Jesus
[01:12:31.557 --> 01:12:35.922]  And it was kicked out of school and is having a psychological assessment done.
[01:12:35.942 --> 01:12:38.945]  In fact, showprisonplanet.tv viewers an image of this.
[01:12:39.385 --> 01:12:43.870]  I mean, we really are living in a secret police-style tyranny.
[01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:51.298]  The RAND Corporation is already announcing that all your local police departments are openly federalized, regular army
[01:12:52.603 --> 01:12:53.763]  Well, we find that the U.S.
[01:12:53.783 --> 01:12:54.524]  is the last country to
[01:13:21.058 --> 01:13:24.400]  He basically completely socialized the socialist system.
[01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:28.743]  It's already completely through Europe, especially Britain.
[01:13:28.783 --> 01:13:34.047]  Britain's an incredible country right now, where back in the 80s, in fact, they federalized.
[01:13:34.387 --> 01:13:40.551]  At least they put a chief police association in charge of all of the police across Britain.
[01:13:41.324 --> 01:13:49.790]  And supposedly they were going to use martial law back in the 80s if Britain had to be sacrificed for first nuclear strikes in order for the U.S.
[01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:50.490]  to survive.
[01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:52.391]  So it's never got out of that mode.
[01:13:52.711 --> 01:13:56.114]  It made it easier for the federalized government to take over.
[01:13:56.394 --> 01:13:58.555]  And this is a socialized system.
[01:13:59.756 --> 01:14:03.639]  I tell people so often, don't get confused with fascism, communism, socialism.
[01:14:03.959 --> 01:14:05.820]  It's all the same thing, you see.
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.862]  And that's what's being used today.
[01:14:09.662 --> 01:14:10.423]  A long time ago,
[01:14:11.431 --> 01:14:33.040]  It was decided by the big powers and economists and those who rule the banking system of the world, along with the politicians and the Fabian Society, that they'd have to bring in a socialist system and train the public, train them gradually, to allow the experts at top to simply handle all the big problems while we were taught to play at the bottom.
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:36.682]  That's been very successful since mainly from the 60s onwards.
[01:14:37.444 --> 01:14:38.684]  And so we're out of the loop.
[01:14:38.784 --> 01:14:39.644]  Most of us were quite content.
[01:14:39.724 --> 01:14:40.205]  That's right.
[01:14:40.225 --> 01:14:43.305]  They made it a moral... a moral right.
[01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:46.326]  Like it's cool that men and women don't care and aren't involved.
[01:14:46.666 --> 01:14:48.246]  It's uncool to be involved.
[01:14:48.466 --> 01:14:49.846]  It's fun to be an idiot.
[01:14:50.606 --> 01:14:51.147]  That's correct.
[01:14:51.307 --> 01:14:55.147]  And well, we're all being idiots and playing in the future credit cards at everyone.
[01:14:56.047 --> 01:15:03.289]  And they gave us a youth culture, a perpetual youth culture, where anyone over a certain age is just a non-existent.
[01:15:05.103 --> 01:15:12.370]  They did not want older, wiser people coming into the game and teaching people what was really going on by their knowledge and history, etc.
[01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:13.951]  That's been very, very successful.
[01:15:13.972 --> 01:15:15.593]  Yeah, you don't revere your elders.
[01:15:15.633 --> 01:15:17.375]  They're just people to be exterminated.
[01:15:17.675 --> 01:15:21.659]  And now Time and Newsweek have articles about, let's just murder all the old people.
[01:15:21.899 --> 01:15:22.920]  It's so liberal.
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:23.621]  That's correct.
[01:15:23.681 --> 01:15:25.502]  And that is coming down.
[01:15:25.543 --> 01:15:27.685]  They started off in Holland with euthanasia.
[01:15:28.285 --> 01:15:29.967]  Britain has just passed laws on it, too.
[01:15:30.849 --> 01:15:36.654]  The US, I think, did their first main one this year, in fact, earlier this year, openly.
[01:15:37.435 --> 01:15:38.455]  And so that's the agenda.
[01:15:38.475 --> 01:15:42.799]  This is all written, again, going back to the days of HG Wells and the Utopians, the Fabians.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:52.747]  And also, population control is a ramp up abortion and sterilization on one end, which is coming down, by the way, as part of the Copenhagen Treaty.
[01:15:53.627 --> 01:15:55.930]  Um, then the ramp up the other side, too.
[01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:59.594]  Obama's already made the communist statements, and that's what it is, folks.
[01:15:59.614 --> 01:16:01.516]  You're under that system right now, if you don't know it.
[01:16:01.916 --> 01:16:04.379]  Look at all the people who are on his staff right now.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.982]  They're all, many of them are card-carrying communists.
[01:16:07.843 --> 01:16:11.487]  And they're true believers in this world-fabian system of socialism.
[01:16:12.636 --> 01:16:28.504]  But just like the media told us communism didn't exist until 1991, they tell us no new world order exists, even as they announce it, even as I was reading two weeks ago in a mercantile report that the number one shirts are hammer and sickle shirts.
[01:16:29.124 --> 01:16:31.005]  That's correct, and a lot of the U.S.
[01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:32.326]  theaters are wearing them.
[01:16:32.346 --> 01:16:33.506]  They think it's all cool and trendy.
[01:16:33.526 --> 01:16:38.369]  I'm going to remember, too, that back in the fifties, remember, the Reed Commission
[01:16:39.171 --> 01:16:40.133]  Authorized by the U.S.
[01:16:40.173 --> 01:16:40.654]  Congress.
[01:16:41.194 --> 01:16:46.763]  And the Senate did investigations into the tax-free foundations of the Rockefellers for Carnegie.
[01:16:47.992 --> 01:16:53.596]  All the other ones there were funding what appeared to be to them all the far-left communist groups.
[01:16:54.276 --> 01:17:07.705]  And Senator Norman Dodd, and he's up on YouTube talking about this, he was astonished when he was told by the CEO of the Fork Foundation that their job of the foundation was to fund NGOs and so on.
[01:17:08.185 --> 01:17:12.288]  So it changed society and culture within the Western world and especially in America.
[01:17:12.888 --> 01:17:16.391]  That it eventually blended seamlessly with that of the Soviet system.
[01:17:16.771 --> 01:17:17.731]  That has happened.
[01:17:18.272 --> 01:17:19.012]  That has happened.
[01:17:19.873 --> 01:17:27.258]  And they're going now to the next step, because in Marxian economics, they must have everything centralized under world government.
[01:17:27.638 --> 01:17:29.920]  That's what the United Nations was established to become.
[01:17:30.757 --> 01:17:33.659]  With the IMF there at the top, the World Bank, and all the rest of it.
[01:17:33.799 --> 01:17:37.822]  Alan, to interrupt from your study, how does Russia tie in?
[01:17:37.842 --> 01:17:43.686]  Because Russia is paying people to have kids now, because they've lost 45 million people thanks to the global agenda.
[01:17:44.186 --> 01:17:47.128]  They're talking about the New World Order on their television.
[01:17:48.049 --> 01:17:53.973]  I mean, is Russia going rogue from the New World Order, or bidding for a better position in the New World Order?
[01:17:54.173 --> 01:17:59.877]  A better position, but however, too, you understand too, when the Bolshevik Revolution took over Russia,
[01:18:00.856 --> 01:18:11.639]  The Bolsheviks were comprised of non-Russians primarily, who moved into the Soviet Union, and they ran the entire Soviet Union through the Soviet era.
[01:18:11.859 --> 01:18:17.501]  It was mainly people from Brooklyn came over and ran it, and they got kicked out, and then now they're the neocons, yeah.
[01:18:17.801 --> 01:18:19.121]  And that's correct as well.
[01:18:19.501 --> 01:18:29.444]  And after the wall came down, and prior to it, many of them moved out, many of them went to Israel, others moved into, a lot of them moved into California, Toronto,
[01:18:30.277 --> 01:18:35.099]  And other places to continue the agenda of the merger over here.
[01:18:35.439 --> 01:18:50.125]  Now Gorbachev himself, who, remember, was the president of the Soviet Union, who was taken around the world on a World Tour by Margaret Thatcher by her arm, arm and arm, and she introduced him to the world as a new type of communist.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:57.084]  So they'd already chosen him to lead the Soviet Union as if it brought down the walls, and we've got to go back to Lenin.
[01:18:57.124 --> 01:19:13.896]  Lenin said the dictatorship would last for 70 or 80 years, and then it would emerge into the West, where the new system would emerge, not quite capitalist, not quite communist, as the socialist Fabian system worldwide, run by experts, eugenicists,
[01:19:14.694 --> 01:19:22.707]  All the guys on top, a planned society, a planned population, and that's what's happening right now as we live.
[01:19:22.747 --> 01:19:27.474]  We're watching the people appointed on Obama's system.
[01:19:29.023 --> 01:19:30.064]  We know who they all are.
[01:19:30.084 --> 01:19:36.689]  They've got tremendous histories of involvement in this communist technique and that the Fabian Society holds.
[01:19:36.749 --> 01:19:40.232]  And by the way, this is not Joseph McCarthy up here.
[01:19:41.013 --> 01:19:43.215]  This isn't Alex Jones or Alan Watt.
[01:19:43.735 --> 01:19:46.998]  Alan, because I read all the same books, he's reading books written
[01:19:47.907 --> 01:19:48.967]  By Gorbachev.
[01:19:49.508 --> 01:19:50.888]  Written by H.G.
[01:19:50.928 --> 01:19:51.288]  Wells.
[01:19:51.649 --> 01:19:53.629]  Written by Leon Trotsky.
[01:19:53.929 --> 01:19:55.690]  Written by Joseph Stalin.
[01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:57.151]  By Vladimir Lenin.
[01:19:57.191 --> 01:19:59.812]  We're telling you what they said.
[01:19:59.832 --> 01:20:02.093]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[01:20:02.413 --> 01:20:05.894]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.
[01:20:06.274 --> 01:20:09.536]  Keep listening for a special offer from PowerVapor.com.
[01:20:09.876 --> 01:20:13.617]  Standard tobacco cigarettes contain over 4,000 harmful chemicals.
[01:20:13.877 --> 01:20:17.059]  Now it's time to release yourself from the grip of big tobacco.
[01:20:20.131 --> 01:20:28.794]  PowerVapor.com is an e-cigarette with the look, feel, and smoke of a real cigarette, but with no tar, no carbon monoxide, and no bad odors.

[01:20:57.382 --> 01:20:59.642]  The smoking gun heard round the world.
[01:21:00.122 --> 01:21:03.983]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[01:21:04.223 --> 01:21:08.364]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[01:21:08.484 --> 01:21:09.864]  You get less for your money.
[01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:15.886]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:18.026]  I think?
[01:21:41.903 --> 01:21:44.885]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:44.905 --> 01:21:46.585]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:46.605 --> 01:21:47.906]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:22:10.982 --> 01:22:13.643]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:13.663 --> 01:22:19.925]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:20.045 --> 01:22:25.087]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:25.427 --> 01:22:28.388]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:22:28.508 --> 01:22:35.210]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:37.452]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:37.692 --> 01:22:39.013]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:39.273 --> 01:22:41.575]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:41.736 --> 01:22:43.577]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:43.857 --> 01:22:48.682]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:22:49.022 --> 01:22:58.150]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:21.013]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?

[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:30.140]  We're good.
[01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:05.237]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:24:05.257 --> 01:24:09.139]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:12.782 --> 01:24:18.745]  By the way, Fox News is playing the 10 biggest stories of 2009.
[01:24:21.467 --> 01:24:28.251]  One of them is how the Japanese government wants to put lithium, an anti-psychotic, in the water supply.
[01:24:29.572 --> 01:24:30.673]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[01:24:31.773 --> 01:24:32.553]  Most U.S.
[01:24:32.593 --> 01:24:35.634]  municipal supplies already have lithium added.
[01:24:37.055 --> 01:24:40.295]  You can go over the toxicology reports for your city's water.
[01:24:41.096 --> 01:24:44.177]  You'll find it's not leaching in, they're adding it.
[01:24:44.197 --> 01:24:52.019]  You know, the national media calls me all the time, Alan White, and they say, you're crazy.
[01:24:52.619 --> 01:24:54.940]  You're saying they're putting cancer viruses in vaccines.
[01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:56.160]  You say they're drugging the water.
[01:24:56.846 --> 01:25:00.428]  And then I start emailing them mainstream articles, and they shut up real fast.
[01:25:00.708 --> 01:25:02.189]  They always think they've gotten me.
[01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:07.111]  Then I'll be talking to some yuppie producer, and I'll say, don't you care about your kids?
[01:25:07.131 --> 01:25:15.555]  And they'll start really, really realizing, for their petty power position of lying, that they're really assaulting their own children.
[01:25:16.275 --> 01:25:18.357]  But they still just giggle and go on with it.
[01:25:19.077 --> 01:25:25.400]  Briefly, from your research, cancer viruses and vaccines, and, uh, calmative toxins in the water.
[01:25:26.693 --> 01:25:27.974]  Very, very old techniques.
[01:25:28.154 --> 01:25:39.982]  They started off with fluoride, of course, in the early days they knew about this stuff, the beginning of the 1900s, and what it did with people, it made them more pliable and more easily managed.
[01:25:40.615 --> 01:25:49.738]  But it was Japan, too, where they first noticed that a particular village in Japan, many years ago, was much more plastered than the average villager.
[01:25:50.338 --> 01:25:54.240]  And they realized that when they tested the water, there was natural lithium in it.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.520]  So that's where the idea sprung from.
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.261]  If you add this to other people's supplies,
[01:25:58.781 --> 01:25:59.301]  I don't think so.
[01:26:17.349 --> 01:26:31.069]  Actually the best friend of Charles Darwin and Darwinism is a big part of this whole socialist agenda It gave them ammunition for their purpose and for their planning for the future based on superior types inferior types and so on and
[01:26:32.914 --> 01:26:47.673]  Julian Huxley talked about the cunning system of control, but it would definitely use pharmacology and it used hypnosis, techniques of persuasion on television and so on.
[01:26:47.873 --> 01:26:51.298]  That's what it would use for the public and it's been very successful already.
[01:26:51.898 --> 01:26:56.904]  Never mind all the stuff that's naturally prescribed by the physicians in the tranquilizing business.
[01:26:58.105 --> 01:26:59.587]  They also put it into the water.
[01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:06.234]  And you've got to go into the writings, too, of another hardline communist, by the way, who worked for MI5, like most of them did.
[01:27:07.415 --> 01:27:09.377]  And that was Arthur Kessler.
[01:27:09.938 --> 01:27:10.919]  That's declassified.
[01:27:10.979 --> 01:27:12.500]  He was an agent for them.
[01:27:15.177 --> 01:27:25.642]  He worked with the United Nations during the 60s on projects to find ways of lobotomizing the human brain chemically, or through viral or bacterial means.
[01:27:26.063 --> 01:27:32.206]  He discussed the means of directing biowarfare techniques right to the brain itself by injections,
[01:27:32.856 --> 01:27:36.177]  He said we can do it through the food, we can do it through the water supply.
[01:27:36.558 --> 01:27:39.239]  The only problem was how to actually introduce it.
[01:27:39.499 --> 01:27:41.120]  And of course the public weren't to know.
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:44.881]  And the UN had different teams all working on the same project.
[01:27:44.961 --> 01:27:46.722]  Millions of dollars went into the investigations.
[01:27:47.387 --> 01:27:53.431]  Russia went the straightforward way of mandatorily lobotomizing people physically.
[01:27:54.272 --> 01:28:03.658]  You know, the criminal element, those who spoke out with wrong think or had an inflexibility of opinion, that was a psychiatric disorder, they would lobotomize them.
[01:28:03.898 --> 01:28:15.266]  But they found that they could do it by inoculations, where they could carry something right to the brain, fever develops in the baby, and they're short a few cents off the dollar from then on.
[01:28:15.986 --> 01:28:17.087]  That's all been done.
[01:28:18.247 --> 01:28:18.928]  Which is good!
[01:28:18.948 --> 01:28:27.712]  I mean you then get a partially lobotomized biological robot that you can then program because programming doesn't work
[01:28:28.476 --> 01:28:29.677]  And officially the United Nations
[01:28:54.134 --> 01:28:59.996]  has lowered the official average IQ by about 4 or 5 points in the last 4 years.
[01:29:00.016 --> 01:29:00.396]  That's right.
[01:29:01.236 --> 01:29:03.977]  Yeah, pretty soon geniuses will be able to tie their shoelaces.
[01:29:03.997 --> 01:29:04.777]  That's correct.
[01:29:05.057 --> 01:29:07.017]  That's correct, yeah.
[01:29:07.077 --> 01:29:12.579]  And they giggle and laugh about this and their argument is, hey, look, the public doesn't care we're brain damaging them.
[01:29:12.959 --> 01:29:14.539]  They deserve to be brain damaged further.
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:20.221]  And now we have the mass campaigns now with the fake flu pandemics and so on.
[01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:22.623]  Alan Watts, stay there.
[01:29:22.703 --> 01:29:32.186]  I want to get into the flu, your take on that, then Copenhagen, and then some phone calls, and we'll play that clip from Fox News about drugging your water.
[01:29:32.206 --> 01:29:34.907]  It's the newest, coolest thing!
[01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:51.390]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.851 --> 01:29:53.471]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.392 --> 01:29:57.173]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.935 --> 01:30:06.798]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:06.938 --> 01:30:08.158]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:30:08.198 --> 01:30:08.879]  It's very real.

[01:30:59.741 --> 01:31:03.984]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.284 --> 01:31:04.904]  Number one.
[01:31:05.204 --> 01:31:08.366]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:08.627 --> 01:31:09.207]  Number two.
[01:31:09.487 --> 01:31:14.030]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:14.830]  It's true.
[01:31:15.111 --> 01:31:19.693]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:19.994 --> 01:31:20.454]  Number three.
[01:31:20.794 --> 01:31:24.096]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.397 --> 01:31:28.139]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:28.860]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.482]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:31.862 --> 01:31:35.265]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.545 --> 01:31:35.765]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.345 --> 01:31:40.268]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.488 --> 01:31:45.252]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:45.532 --> 01:31:49.556]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:49.696 --> 01:31:51.278]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.498 --> 01:31:53.580]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.083]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:01.397 --> 01:32:05.018]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.338 --> 01:32:13.480]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.201 --> 01:32:18.242]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:18.842 --> 01:32:29.665]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.285 --> 01:32:39.293]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:39.794 --> 01:32:44.838]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.239 --> 01:32:52.425]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:52.725 --> 01:32:55.468]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:00.276 --> 01:33:00.956]  No tax.
[01:33:01.777 --> 01:33:11.501]  Yeah, here's Fox News, and I've seen MSNBC, the clips on YouTube, where they propose putting Prozac in the water.
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:32.262]  And the federal government's also proposing putting statins in the water.
[01:33:33.542 --> 01:33:38.404]  They're now teaching kids that five-year-olds need anti-cholesterol drugs, which completely eat your liver.
[01:33:39.365 --> 01:33:41.566]  It just doesn't even help you with cholesterol.
[01:33:41.666 --> 01:33:42.926]  It's all lies.
[01:33:43.867 --> 01:33:47.268]  Now, over 150 chemicals on average are put in U.S.
[01:33:47.308 --> 01:33:47.808]  drinking water.
[01:33:48.308 --> 01:33:49.609]  Same thing in Canada and the U.K.
[01:33:50.009 --> 01:33:50.910]  Some have over 300.
[01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:54.071]  And it's lithium.
[01:33:55.011 --> 01:33:55.351]  Everything.
[01:33:55.371 --> 01:33:56.712]  Of course, lithium's a heavy metal.
[01:33:57.583 --> 01:33:58.443]  Very toxic.
[01:33:59.284 --> 01:34:01.244]  It's the same thing with fluoride.
[01:34:01.824 --> 01:34:02.724]  Sodium fluoride.
[01:34:03.265 --> 01:34:09.506]  But when you hear fluoride, that's a catch-all term under federal regulations for over 300 chemicals they're allowed to put in.
[01:34:10.387 --> 01:34:14.648]  And, I mean, they, mercury, every, they are killing you!
[01:34:15.588 --> 01:34:19.009]  Okay, that's why people look so bad, even if they exercise and try to eat healthy.
[01:34:19.585 --> 01:34:21.989]  I mean, these are sickos, okay?
[01:34:22.450 --> 01:34:24.434]  They openly write textbooks how they want to kill us.
[01:34:24.454 --> 01:34:26.738]  We're going to talk to Alan Watt about that in a moment.
[01:34:27.158 --> 01:34:29.643]  A real expert on this stuff and a big part of Fall of the Republic.
[01:34:30.083 --> 01:34:32.107]  But here's Fox Television.
[01:34:33.489 --> 01:34:40.336]  With only two weeks left of 2009, we're taking a look back at some of the most interesting health care discoveries of the past year.
[01:34:40.356 --> 01:34:44.420]  Joining us is FOX 9 medical expert Dr. Arkell Giorgio to talk about it.
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:44.920]  Good morning.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:45.521]  Good morning.
[01:34:46.061 --> 01:34:46.542]  First, the U.S.
[01:34:46.582 --> 01:34:52.848]  has been adding a fluoride to its public water supply for decades, of course to prevent tooth decay.
[01:34:53.228 --> 01:34:57.172]  A lot of researchers from Japan are suggesting that we add lithium.
[01:34:57.252 --> 01:34:58.253]  So why is that?
[01:34:58.925 --> 01:35:02.368]  Well, they're actually not suggesting it, but they're certainly looking into it.
[01:35:02.469 --> 01:35:09.596]  Lithium is a medication that, in prescription doses, treats mood disorders in people with bipolar disorder or manic-depressive illness.
[01:35:09.956 --> 01:35:18.485]  And what these researchers found in Japan is that lithium is present in trace amounts in the normal water supply in some communities.
[01:35:18.585 --> 01:35:21.748]  And in those communities, they have a lower suicide rate.
[01:35:22.208 --> 01:35:34.773]  And so they're really investigating whether trace amounts of lithium can just change the mood in a positive way without having the bad effects of lithium to really affect the mood and decrease the suicide rate.
[01:35:34.873 --> 01:35:36.434]  Very interesting concept.
[01:35:36.654 --> 01:35:40.575]  You know, it's the same reason why we put iodine in salt, fluoride in water.
[01:35:41.416 --> 01:35:44.637]  There's many different examples of when we put trace amounts
[01:35:45.117 --> 01:35:48.958]  So what they do is they pitch it to you as a great thing.
[01:35:48.998 --> 01:35:50.678]  It's already being done.
[01:35:50.698 --> 01:35:52.298]  Lithium's already put in your water.
[01:35:52.338 --> 01:35:54.339]  Okay, let me get everybody the newsflash.
[01:35:54.379 --> 01:35:57.199]  You can pull up an EPA report for any major city.
[01:36:11.275 --> 01:36:14.477]  And sure, they can say small towns have natural trace amounts.
[01:36:14.977 --> 01:36:19.459]  Some towns have natural trace amounts of mercury, or arsenic, or cyanide.
[01:36:19.859 --> 01:36:22.820]  Does it mean you want to go drink it, Alan Watt?
[01:36:22.921 --> 01:36:27.683]  They're really getting us ready for this, because they know we're exposing that they're already putting it in the water.
[01:36:28.003 --> 01:36:30.284]  So they're going, yeah, we're chemtrailing you.
[01:36:30.304 --> 01:36:31.765]  John P. Holdren this year admitted it.
[01:36:32.085 --> 01:36:33.646]  And yeah, we're putting stuff in your water.
[01:36:34.086 --> 01:36:35.086]  What's wrong with that?
[01:36:35.106 --> 01:36:38.768]  We have to go back again quite some time.
[01:36:39.372 --> 01:36:42.274]  To realize that this is nothing new about the idea.
[01:36:43.735 --> 01:36:53.082]  The big boys had global meetings, back in the 30s even, 40s, 50s, always looking towards this future world society they were going to bring it to be.
[01:36:54.003 --> 01:37:01.649]  And they talked about ways of doing it, and pharma was to be a big part of it, there's no doubt about that, they all thought about using pharma.
[01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:04.271]  And you find with Zygmunt Brzezinski,
[01:37:04.941 --> 01:37:07.121]  Who pretty well says he's got his own man.
[01:37:07.562 --> 01:37:16.443]  And as the president now, because he trains him, in his book, Between Two Ages, that he published back in the 1970s, he talked about mind control.
[01:37:17.203 --> 01:37:18.864]  He talked about the technotronic era.
[01:37:18.884 --> 01:37:24.205]  But he talked about other methods, too, where the public would be basically made docile.
[01:37:24.685 --> 01:37:29.966]  He said it can be done electronically by using standing waves across a whole continent, if need be.
[01:37:30.566 --> 01:37:33.027]  Which means it was already tested out back in the 70s.
[01:37:33.087 --> 01:37:34.587]  That's how it works.
[01:37:35.633 --> 01:37:38.014]  But they also mentioned other methods as well.
[01:37:38.534 --> 01:37:46.537]  And then I saw a Baltimore Sun article about eight years ago where it said, oh, DARPA in major cities is testing calming waves.
[01:37:46.557 --> 01:37:47.177]  That's right.
[01:37:47.417 --> 01:37:48.717]  To make everyone happy.
[01:37:48.757 --> 01:37:51.378]  What's wrong with calming waves, Alan?
[01:37:52.559 --> 01:37:53.939]  Why are you and I different?
[01:37:53.999 --> 01:37:58.681]  Why don't we love the government putting a toxic heavy metal in the water to brain damages?
[01:37:59.241 --> 01:38:01.501]  Why don't we like mind control towers?
[01:38:01.922 --> 01:38:02.962]  Why don't we like
[01:38:03.603 --> 01:38:06.268]  Police in black uniforms and secret arrest and torture.
[01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:08.492]  What's wrong with us, Alan Watt?
[01:38:08.893 --> 01:38:14.284]  I think there's something wrong with the uptake in our brains for these particular chemicals, perhaps.
[01:38:14.364 --> 01:38:15.366]  We leave somewhere else.
[01:38:16.144 --> 01:38:16.364]  I think?
[01:38:35.246 --> 01:38:44.512]  Don't worry, we just brain damaged your child and lowered their IQ by 3 points.
[01:38:44.973 --> 01:38:46.714]  And after 50 shots they're gonna be retarded.
[01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:48.255]  Don't worry, I've got power.
[01:38:48.295 --> 01:38:49.515]  I wear a white lab coat.
[01:38:50.056 --> 01:38:51.136]  Oh, I love my mistress.
[01:38:51.277 --> 01:38:51.717]  Oh, go ahead.
[01:38:52.337 --> 01:39:14.187]  And then, some people, there's always a few individuals where, because these particular bio-warfare chemicals will attach themselves to uptake amino acids to go to the brain, because of different physiologies, sometimes it's really somewhere else, into the intestine, into other parts of the body, they'll end up with various allergies, it's a very complex... Well, take the movie, Serenity.
[01:39:14.207 --> 01:39:17.729]  Based on the TV, well, I mean, you may have seen it, but for those that don't know,
[01:39:18.801 --> 01:39:30.573]  They go to this planet where everybody's died to find out, and they discover the government was putting basically Prozac into the air, but they found that 1% of people it makes them psycho killers.
[01:39:30.874 --> 01:39:35.258]  So that's the establishment kind of saying, what we're doing is having some unintended consequences.
[01:39:35.298 --> 01:39:35.599]  Go ahead.
[01:39:36.155 --> 01:39:39.036]  Yes, and it's the same when they inject you with various things.
[01:39:39.156 --> 01:39:47.560]  Not everyone comes down with the fever, but often those children will come down with asthma or intestinal problems for the rest of their life.
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:57.383]  They admit that all Crohn's cases have the measles and other vaccine antibodies because, oh, the autoimmune attack didn't eat your brain, it ate your guts.
[01:39:59.484 --> 01:40:07.091]  And so you often find people who have these problems are a bit brighter, they're more aware of what's going on because their brain was unaffected.
[01:40:07.451 --> 01:40:13.356]  Now they're going for everyone now with pharma, the calmatives as they call them, openly.
[01:40:13.376 --> 01:40:20.482]  And remember after 9-11, I think it was Rumsfeld, he was on television in the US, it was broadcast on Canadian TV.
[01:40:21.426 --> 01:40:25.989]  And he was asked by a reporter, what are you going to do if another major crisis breaks out?
[01:40:26.029 --> 01:40:27.650]  He says, we've got contingency plans.
[01:40:27.690 --> 01:40:31.913]  He says, we've aerosolized Valium and Prozac.
[01:40:31.953 --> 01:40:34.695]  He said, we can spray over entire cities or whole areas.
[01:40:35.476 --> 01:40:38.778]  And I thought, well, perfect, because the Valium kicks in quick, you see.
[01:40:40.169 --> 01:40:52.934]  And now they've been spraying us, so John P. Holder can come out and say, yes, we're spraying you.
[01:40:53.275 --> 01:40:54.775]  He can tell the Associated Press.
[01:40:55.235 --> 01:40:58.337]  There could be video of it, and people just go, they're not spraying me.
[01:40:58.477 --> 01:41:00.217]  Well, the White House Science Czar just said they are.
[01:41:00.237 --> 01:41:01.198]  No, they're not.
[01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:02.602]  No, they're not.
[01:41:02.622 --> 01:41:03.884]  No justification, no follow-up, no whys.
[01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:28.641]  Well, Alan, what's wrong with having aluminum dioxide sprayed on you?
[01:41:29.021 --> 01:41:30.381]  I mean, they're only helping you.
[01:41:30.581 --> 01:41:31.042]  That's right.
[01:41:31.502 --> 01:41:33.603]  And then the barium will help build up.
[01:41:33.623 --> 01:41:37.505]  And you'll get cancer early, so you're not a burden on the coming healthcare system.
[01:41:39.605 --> 01:41:41.066]  These are really loving people.
[01:41:41.446 --> 01:41:42.447]  They're just so loving.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:56.428]  You know, you have to go into the characters behind all of this, and who is at the Copenhagen meeting, for instance, and the big eugenicists are there, the big utopians are there, Dennis Meadows is there, he was one of the big boys of the Club of Rome.
[01:41:56.608 --> 01:42:02.772]  In fact, talk about that, the head of the Chinese delegation said, we own your debt, this is for those, Monday, Associated Press and others,
[01:42:04.133 --> 01:42:08.996]  And we want global government, one-child policies for Americans.
[01:42:09.176 --> 01:42:13.199]  And our government suddenly announced, yeah, we're looking at this.
[01:42:13.579 --> 01:42:14.179]  Go ahead, Alan.
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:17.942]  And don't forget, if they look at the panel appointed in the U.S.
[01:42:18.702 --> 01:42:26.267]  Congress, there's John Holdren there who wrote the book, Ecoscience, back in the 70s with another mainline communist.
[01:42:26.848 --> 01:42:30.030]  And they are communists, by the way, hardline communists.
[01:42:30.692 --> 01:42:36.536]  And, um, Holden himself said he wants compulsory sterilization of the public.
[01:42:36.936 --> 01:42:45.721]  He said we can't do the same in America as we do in India, because people in America are better educated, they might catch on.
[01:42:46.221 --> 01:42:51.704]  So they'll have to do it surreptitiously, covertly, and basically sterilize the people by other means.
[01:42:52.124 --> 01:42:55.165]  And they discussed what the ideal population should be.
[01:42:55.385 --> 01:43:05.010]  Now these characters are all on board, and you have your Holdrens, and every government of the Western world right now, that's not by chance, they're all on board right now, appointed.
[01:43:06.190 --> 01:43:10.552]  And the whole agenda is now set to roll forth at an incredible pace.
[01:43:11.353 --> 01:43:12.653]  Remember too, in communism,
[01:43:14.972 --> 01:43:27.862]  Families contaminate the children according to them, so that Bertrand Russell agreed with this, by passing on outmoded family values.
[01:43:27.962 --> 01:43:39.252]  Yeah, you've got to have the state purely programming, and now everywhere, under the environment, police, most of the kids curriculum is dossiers on mommy and daddy, on record!
[01:43:40.761 --> 01:43:44.823]  And they also said in the Communist Manifesto that the family was an enemy.
[01:43:44.843 --> 01:43:51.025]  Because the state must be able to talk to you directly with no relative around to stand up with you.
[01:43:51.285 --> 01:44:01.269]  And because we've had a couple generations raised in Europe and the US and Canada on this, parents are in the news locally and going, I'm glad my child is my boss and writes reports on me.
[01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:05.393]  And that was all part of the push for single mums, by the way.
[01:44:05.853 --> 01:44:09.798]  People don't realize that they don't give a darn about mothers and women's rights.
[01:44:10.098 --> 01:44:12.341]  They use them all for a different purpose.
[01:44:13.362 --> 01:44:18.508]  To divide families and get them down until it's just you, the unit, like Orwell's 84.
[01:44:19.409 --> 01:44:22.072]  With that camera, I can pull you up and say, yeah, you, Smith.
[01:44:22.532 --> 01:44:24.034]  And there's nobody around to help you.
[01:44:24.054 --> 01:44:24.875]  That's for government.
[01:44:25.215 --> 01:44:26.056]  And HG Wells said that.
[01:44:26.096 --> 01:44:33.704]  We will never win until we can talk directly to each citizen and there's no other citizen will stand up beside them.
[01:44:34.124 --> 01:44:35.085]  That's already here.
[01:44:35.566 --> 01:44:41.752]  But you have to understand too, another plank of the manifesto was the distribution of wealth.
[01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:48.293]  And they could not bring it through under its guise, because everyone knew, at least not so long ago, what communism was.
[01:44:48.633 --> 01:44:50.214]  But now it's for the Earth!
[01:44:50.254 --> 01:44:53.796]  You pay Al Gore, and the polar bears live!
[01:44:54.256 --> 01:45:04.041]  Yes, they brought it back under a different guise, much more clever, and wrapped some scientific jargon and a lot of fakery over it, and a lot of hype and terror and fear if you don't comply.
[01:45:05.001 --> 01:45:10.888]  And they promised new technologies to free everyone.
[01:45:11.128 --> 01:45:14.932]  Well, they really set up a scientific dictatorship that doesn't allow new technologies to develop.
[01:45:15.192 --> 01:45:16.314]  That's actually in the treaty.
[01:45:16.734 --> 01:45:19.837]  Actually, the communists, that was their favorite thing 80 years ago, Alan.
[01:45:21.224 --> 01:45:22.645]  I'm going to understand it never died.
[01:45:22.665 --> 01:45:26.826]  It never died, as the Reeves Commission showed, it was to blend with the West.
[01:45:26.926 --> 01:45:45.372]  By the time it would blend, the West would already be degraded culturally, and we have been degraded, thanks to Hollywood and television, and again through the academia system, because Lenin said, too, we must have an international academic authority, and that was set up eventually by the United Nations.
[01:45:45.412 --> 01:45:49.834]  So everything's standardized to the point where the average person tuning in who's a new listener
[01:45:50.789 --> 01:45:53.370]  Just thinks we're gibbering and jabbering.
[01:45:53.410 --> 01:45:57.573]  I see people on YouTube everywhere, they watch these videos, they go, what are they talking about?
[01:45:58.333 --> 01:46:01.835]  And it's like, we're weird because we know the names of government groups.
[01:46:02.095 --> 01:46:02.675]  That's bad.
[01:46:02.735 --> 01:46:03.215]  That's right.
[01:46:03.496 --> 01:46:10.199]  And they've also been trained, like Brzezinski said, that unless it's on mainstream media, that they will not believe it.
[01:46:10.719 --> 01:46:16.022]  By the same token, if something is on mainstream media, which is totally fictitious, they will believe it.
[01:46:16.622 --> 01:46:17.903]  Like the fake flu pandemic.
[01:46:19.268 --> 01:46:32.514]  But I was contacted recently by a group under Ted Turner's group, Massive Network System, asking me if I'd come on and talk about global warming before the Copenhagen thing came up.
[01:46:33.035 --> 01:46:36.616]  And the two producers, a man and a woman, talked to me for quite some time.
[01:46:37.777 --> 01:46:41.679]  And I caught on right away that they wanted someone who didn't know their facts.
[01:46:41.719 --> 01:46:44.300]  They wanted someone who would just be anti-this or anti-that.
[01:46:45.328 --> 01:46:56.437]  And I was dishing out names, speeches, comments made by the big boys themselves on creating the fake global warming crisis like the Club of Rome and the two founders that mentioned them.
[01:46:56.537 --> 01:46:57.417]  I mentioned their book.
[01:46:58.218 --> 01:47:00.780]  I said they came up with the idea and admitted in their book.
[01:47:01.341 --> 01:47:05.784]  And I mentioned fact after fact after fact for an hour.
[01:47:06.224 --> 01:47:12.249]  And I knew by the end of the hour these folk would not have me on because they did not want someone on who could present the fact.
[01:47:12.924 --> 01:47:18.767]  They wanted somebody on to say, I like global warming, means I'll be able to surf more.
[01:47:18.787 --> 01:47:20.288]  You would have been on TV.
[01:47:21.148 --> 01:47:21.508]  That's right.
[01:47:22.029 --> 01:47:29.372]  They wanted someone who would just go up there and be emotional and angry and so on, but have no fact to back anything up.
[01:47:30.693 --> 01:47:34.295]  That would discredit all the rest of them who had the fact that were never heard.
[01:47:34.895 --> 01:47:38.437]  But the system is so discredited that even if that was the case,
[01:47:39.497 --> 01:47:41.378]  I mean, that's why the globalists are running out of steam.
[01:47:41.838 --> 01:47:43.018]  They're a scientific dictatorship.
[01:47:43.038 --> 01:47:43.378]  Look at this.
[01:47:43.438 --> 01:47:45.859]  Wimberley School teaches students to be detectives.
[01:47:46.519 --> 01:47:49.160]  And it says they come home and investigate their parents.
[01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:50.160]  This is outside Austin.
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:52.221]  This is done in Austin, too.
[01:47:52.601 --> 01:47:59.843]  They come home and inspect their parents and write up detectives' reports on their parents' carbon footprint.
[01:48:00.483 --> 01:48:02.304]  This is going on nationwide.
[01:48:02.424 --> 01:48:03.124]  Oh, the freedom.
[01:48:04.071 --> 01:48:10.517]  Yes, and now in Britain, they're going after people who live in rural communities.
[01:48:10.537 --> 01:48:13.060]  Remember, Agenda 21 at the United Nations.
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:22.069]  It all ties together where the rural folk have to be crushed into the already overcrowded cities as this generation is to die off.
[01:48:22.549 --> 01:48:24.511]  That's the key to it over the next 30, 40 years.
[01:48:29.846 --> 01:48:40.392]  Yeah, they're shutting off everybody's industry, and this is all in their own statements to destroy your independence.
[01:48:40.412 --> 01:48:43.754]  Let's talk to John in Maine, and then Andy and David in the next segment.
[01:48:43.794 --> 01:48:45.074]  John, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:48:46.275 --> 01:48:47.396]  Well, hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:48:47.956 --> 01:48:48.376]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:48:50.447 --> 01:49:02.796]  Yeah, so I've been listening to you for about two weeks now, and a lot of the stuff you've been saying has really been matching up with my experience after working on Wall Street for about ten years.
[01:49:03.396 --> 01:49:11.522]  I worked for Deutsche Bank, private bank, and I was just involved basically in an enormous money laundering operation.
[01:49:13.903 --> 01:49:17.906]  It was a lot of the very same people who were calling for higher taxes
[01:49:18.692 --> 01:49:26.038]  Have all their money in these offshore accounts with layer upon layer of legal protection so that people will never buy their money.
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:29.842]  And it's all selectively enforced.
[01:49:29.882 --> 01:49:34.626]  They only burn the little people who are offshore and steal their money for themselves.
[01:49:34.666 --> 01:49:41.672]  Yes, it's private banks, private bankers that now run the government and run the IRS.
[01:49:42.273 --> 01:49:43.594]  Any more comments, John?
[01:49:45.157 --> 01:49:57.188]  No, well, the only other thing I wanted to say is that, you know, I was working down in the Miami office, and these banks are involved in huge drug money laundering operations as well.
[01:49:57.468 --> 01:49:57.869]  That's all.
[01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:07.177]  You should write a report about it, but I mean, they now admit on British television that our government grows the opium, but says, oh, it's a good thing.
[01:50:07.637 --> 01:50:10.360]  I mean, there really is a coming out in the open now, isn't there?
[01:50:11.518 --> 01:50:15.702]  I think it was just yesterday, there's an article in a Canadian newspaper and in a U.S.
[01:50:15.742 --> 01:50:25.471]  newspaper which stated after a survey and investigation that the banks that were kept afloat during this supposed, and that's a planned crisis, obviously.
[01:50:25.771 --> 01:50:26.552]  Yeah, the U.N.
[01:50:26.612 --> 01:50:29.794]  said drug money kept us afloat, drug money is good.
[01:50:29.814 --> 01:50:30.395]  That's right, that's right.
[01:50:30.435 --> 01:50:31.956]  That's what came out there, drug money did it.
[01:50:32.497 --> 01:50:38.102]  And of course there'll be no investigation as to who's responsible because they all know who's responsible.
[01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:41.963]  But if you're caught with a matchbox of it, you're going to a slave prison.
[01:50:42.224 --> 01:50:42.704]  You're correct.
[01:50:42.744 --> 01:50:46.350]  In fact, someone in the State's Home the other day said they could not believe it.
[01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:50.756]  They're 65, and they were asked why they wanted to buy a box of match suits.
[01:50:52.506 --> 01:50:53.387]  Oh yeah, everywhere.
[01:50:53.487 --> 01:50:56.291]  Matches, spray paint, over-the-counter drugs.
[01:50:56.671 --> 01:50:57.973]  Everyone's being asked questions.
[01:50:58.093 --> 01:51:00.056]  All the clerks are being trained to ask questions.
[01:51:00.076 --> 01:51:03.340]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:05.562]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:51:06.023 --> 01:51:06.423]  Don't!
[01:51:06.884 --> 01:51:09.888]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:51:10.288 --> 01:51:16.052]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:51:33.965 --> 01:51:34.926]  Herb K. was right.
[01:51:35.166 --> 01:51:38.208]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:51:38.328 --> 01:51:39.348]  What have you got to lose?
[01:51:39.688 --> 01:51:42.890]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:51:43.411 --> 01:51:44.031]  Get Herb K.'
[01:51:43.951 --> 01:51:47.093]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:51:47.353 --> 01:51:47.713]  Call 888-352-7726.
[01:51:47.733 --> 01:51:48.193]  That's 888-352-7726.
[01:51:48.213 --> 01:51:48.253]  888-352-7726.
[01:52:00.273 --> 01:52:03.315]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:03.655 --> 01:52:07.277]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:07.557 --> 01:52:11.019]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:52:11.279 --> 01:52:18.763]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[01:52:18.763 --> 01:52:19.123]  I think so.
[01:52:43.882 --> 01:52:44.102]  I think so.
[01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:01.370]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:01.410 --> 01:53:06.755]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:06.995 --> 01:53:11.619]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:17.104]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:53:17.605 --> 01:53:22.289]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:22.813 --> 01:53:29.736]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:53:29.936 --> 01:53:30.836]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:31.036 --> 01:53:37.419]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:53:37.739 --> 01:53:40.580]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:44.062]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:53:47.723 --> 01:53:49.504]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:51.944 --> 01:53:56.466]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:56.786 --> 01:53:59.166]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:54:26.802 --> 01:54:29.763]  We have a group of criminal pirates running our society.
[01:54:29.783 --> 01:54:33.404]  They're training your children to spy on you and despise you.
[01:54:33.624 --> 01:54:36.085]  We're teaching them they're the boss.
[01:54:36.545 --> 01:54:37.445]  Al Gore on tape.
[01:54:37.866 --> 01:54:39.686]  Your parents don't know, you do.
[01:54:40.046 --> 01:54:41.247]  You're in control now.
[01:54:41.707 --> 01:54:45.888]  Time magazine for kids saying your parents belong to a bygone pathetic age.
[01:54:46.269 --> 01:54:48.829]  You know freedom and you want the microchip.
[01:54:48.850 --> 01:54:50.050]  That's a paraphrase quote.
[01:54:50.675 --> 01:54:51.936]  I mean, just bizarre.
[01:54:52.296 --> 01:54:53.216]  And it's over the top.
[01:54:53.256 --> 01:54:56.057]  They just intimidate you into accepting tyranny.
[01:54:56.097 --> 01:54:58.899]  They just throw it in your face and you just capitulate.
[01:54:59.319 --> 01:55:00.919]  Alan Watt comments on that.
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:04.661]  That's true because they are organized.
[01:55:05.501 --> 01:55:10.684]  It can't help but be organized because the biggest bankers on the planet are in on this whole future.
[01:55:10.704 --> 01:55:16.006]  I used to be astonished as to why Victor Rothschild, Lord Victor Rothschild,
[01:55:16.836 --> 01:55:22.741]  Um, it's now been disclosed, uh, and he knew it all along in the 60s and the 40s, even in the 50s.
[01:55:23.161 --> 01:55:26.664]  He was a member of the Communist Party he joined at Cambridge.
[01:55:27.604 --> 01:55:31.908]  So he was a man from one of the richest, if not the richest, banking family on the planet.
[01:55:32.528 --> 01:55:35.110]  He also belonged to the Mossad, later on.
[01:55:36.211 --> 01:55:42.996]  And he, um, he sold out all of the plans of Britain, including the A-bomb, to the Russians.
[01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:44.337]  He gave it to them, basically.
[01:55:45.163 --> 01:55:53.855]  And he, his personal belief, and this is what's so important was, his personal belief was that the right sort of people would eventually rule the world.
[01:55:55.226 --> 01:56:06.911]  And these were the most intelligent, once again on the Darwinian principle, who'd come down through two centuries accumulating, getting to the top, holding on to wealth, for instance, while they had the right to rule.
[01:56:07.151 --> 01:56:19.076]  But he believed that money, and he was a truthful character, a banker, he said, money's only a system of controlling people and gaining power for those in the top.
[01:56:19.136 --> 01:56:22.297]  Everyone works, as Karl Marx said, via labor.
[01:56:22.357 --> 01:56:24.578]  Labor's the only real producer there is.
[01:56:25.481 --> 01:56:28.043]  That's right, the banks don't need more tax money.
[01:56:28.583 --> 01:56:29.764]  It's a system of control.
[01:56:30.104 --> 01:56:34.907]  And speaking of that, they are now announcing the Arabs are fully going off the dollar.
[01:56:34.967 --> 01:56:36.728]  It is the end of the dollar.
[01:56:44.557 --> 01:56:45.077]  That's correct.
[01:56:45.117 --> 01:56:48.899]  And they knew this back, remember, when they signed the GATT Treaty.
[01:56:49.379 --> 01:56:50.700]  The public were kept out of it.
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:56.202]  It was never explained to them by any media what the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs was.
[01:56:56.989 --> 01:56:57.129]  Yes.
[01:56:57.169 --> 01:56:57.309]  Yes.
[01:57:20.365 --> 01:57:26.868]  And the public were utterly ignorant, even when suddenly everything started to say, made in China, made in China.
[01:57:28.089 --> 01:57:30.050]  Most of the public are never conscious.
[01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:33.231]  They love paying to lose their job.
[01:57:33.251 --> 01:57:34.452]  They love SWAT teams.
[01:57:34.652 --> 01:57:35.652]  They love open borders.
[01:57:35.672 --> 01:57:38.094]  They love their kids coming home and ordering them around.
[01:57:38.314 --> 01:57:39.694]  They love drinking fluoride.
[01:57:40.014 --> 01:57:40.515]  They love it!
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:46.585]  They do, and they love to play, and that's a problem, and that is a big problem.
[01:57:46.765 --> 01:57:52.210]  They are the middle people who will do nothing, whichever way the winner goes.
[01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:53.311]  That's how it is.
[01:57:53.371 --> 01:57:54.672]  That's right, that's why they do it.
[01:57:54.752 --> 01:58:01.718]  They think the globalists are winning, and so even now that it's proven we're going into a tyrannical world government, they're going, I like it!
[01:58:02.058 --> 01:58:03.139]  I love my kids!
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:05.661]  I'll be okay, because I keep my head down.
[01:58:05.681 --> 01:58:06.702]  That's their attitude.
[01:58:08.124 --> 01:58:09.664]  Well, it's like the guy in 1984.
[01:58:09.704 --> 01:58:14.726]  He's bragging on his kid being a spy, and when his kid denounces him, he says, I don't know what little guy denounced me.
[01:58:14.766 --> 01:58:15.546]  I'm sure he was right.
[01:58:15.826 --> 01:58:16.766]  I'm so proud of him.
[01:58:17.406 --> 01:58:18.847]  And it's the same thing.
[01:58:18.907 --> 01:58:20.847]  I mean, listen, Alan, great interview.
[01:58:21.247 --> 01:58:26.408]  We're going to have you on, what, early January for two full hours to take more calls.
[01:58:26.448 --> 01:58:27.269]  Sorry to all the callers.
[01:58:27.289 --> 01:58:28.349]  We'll get to more of you tomorrow.
[01:58:28.909 --> 01:58:29.890]  Alan, great job.
[01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:31.930]  Your website is cometothematrix.com.
[01:58:32.230 --> 01:58:35.152]  My websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:58:35.432 --> 01:58:38.313]  Let me say bye to you, Alan, here as the show ends.
[01:58:38.413 --> 01:58:39.714]  See Alan Watt in the film.
[01:58:42.035 --> 01:58:44.135]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.636 --> 01:58:47.857]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.425 --> 01:58:55.028]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:55.048 --> 01:58:58.431]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:58.671 --> 01:59:03.455]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:59:03.475 --> 01:59:09.701]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:09.861 --> 01:59:12.123]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:12.603 --> 01:59:12.923]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:12.943 --> 01:59:13.364]  Bernanke?
[01:59:13.444 --> 01:59:14.084]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:14.124 --> 01:59:15.385]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.405 --> 01:59:17.647]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:31.539 --> 01:59:33.380]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:38.501]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:38.821 --> 01:59:48.765]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:53.226 --> 01:59:55.127]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.607 --> 01:59:58.388]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.346 --> 02:00:04.987]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.648 --> 02:00:06.689]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:08.531]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.172 --> 02:00:09.993]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.774 --> 02:00:12.677]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.697 --> 02:00:15.961]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.521 --> 02:00:20.586]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:34.701]  Okay, we are simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:34.721 --> 02:00:36.162]  Chuck Norris just called in.
[02:00:36.182 --> 02:00:37.963]  We're lining him up to go live with him.
[02:00:39.723 --> 02:00:41.944]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:00:42.004 --> 02:00:45.145]  We have several guests joining us from Copenhagen, Denmark.
[02:00:45.245 --> 02:00:51.868]  Several reporters, one a reporter, one a scientist, to be breaking down the fraud of man-made global warming.
[02:00:53.721 --> 02:01:02.166]  Obviously not just the ClimateGate emails where the head UN scientist are engaged in premeditated fraud covering up the decline of temperatures in the last nine years.
[02:01:03.107 --> 02:01:07.890]  Temperatures stopped heating up 15 years ago, started dropping nine years ago.
[02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:12.032]  We'll be covering that coming up in the next hour.
[02:01:12.873 --> 02:01:22.499]  We're also going to get into the fact that Ron Paul said here last Friday that he believes the Obama takeover of health care to make even more Americans dependent on the government
[02:01:24.850 --> 02:01:28.333]  Quarter million dollar fines, five years in prison if you don't get insurance.
[02:01:28.713 --> 02:01:33.256]  He believes as it stands it will pass, but by one vote.
[02:01:33.356 --> 02:01:42.903]  So we better put pressure on Lieberman and let him know that if he doesn't vote against this, somehow the whole nation is going to target him to not be re-elected.
[02:01:44.878 --> 02:01:48.179]  But for the next 30 minutes, we are joined by Chuck Norris.
[02:01:48.739 --> 02:01:53.761]  He really doesn't need any introduction, though I will give him one here today.
[02:01:54.101 --> 02:01:57.662]  He's a martial arts expert, probably the most famous martial arts person in the world.
[02:01:57.682 --> 02:01:59.943]  He joined the Air Force after high school.
[02:02:00.003 --> 02:02:05.225]  During his service, he went to South Korea, where he began his training in martial arts and taekwondo.
[02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:10.707]  He returned to Los Angeles in 1962 and opened a karate school catering to such celebrities as Steve McQueen.
[02:02:11.327 --> 02:02:12.168]  Good to have you here with us.
[02:02:12.188 --> 02:02:13.229]  We're about to go to break.
[02:02:38.527 --> 02:02:48.574]  But I want to come back and talk about Copenhagen, Obama health care, all these proposals for new taxes, but what's got Chuck Norris most fired up right now?
[02:02:49.915 --> 02:02:54.358]  The health care has me most fired up right now, because they're just going in the wrong direction.
[02:02:54.378 --> 02:03:00.903]  And after we come back from the commercial, I can kind of give you an idea of how I think we should work on the health care issue.
[02:03:02.024 --> 02:03:02.584]  Absolutely.
[02:03:02.644 --> 02:03:05.146]  So you're more concerned about health care than even Copenhagen?
[02:03:06.986 --> 02:03:08.287]  I don't think they're ever going to get together.
[02:03:08.307 --> 02:03:11.209]  I can't see all these nations working together.
[02:03:11.469 --> 02:03:19.135]  I don't see China or India or any of them cooperating on trying to cut down green gas emissions.
[02:03:21.757 --> 02:03:27.421]  The thing is, we have to lead by example, Alex.
[02:03:27.461 --> 02:03:29.783]  We, the United States, have to lead by example.
[02:03:30.704 --> 02:03:34.627]  We should use the stimulus money to develop alternative sources of energy.
[02:03:35.262 --> 02:03:38.905]  Let's us here in our own country get our bed in order.
[02:03:39.765 --> 02:03:44.749]  Instead of putting garbage in dumps in the ocean, how about developing a way to use it for fuel?
[02:03:45.229 --> 02:03:51.773]  You know, we're polluting our oceans, you know, and we're polluting our dumps, you know, we're filling all these gases up in these dumps.
[02:03:52.114 --> 02:04:02.721]  Why not figure out a way to make... The people have already found ways of making, turning garbage into fuel, but the government won't pursue it and help make it a reality.
[02:04:03.277 --> 02:04:05.499]  You know, we could use alternative sources of energy.
[02:04:05.559 --> 02:04:08.841]  We could then develop fuel-efficient cars.
[02:04:09.322 --> 02:04:13.245]  You know, we don't need cars that can do 140 miles an hour on the road.
[02:04:13.525 --> 02:04:16.867]  How about developing a fuel-efficient car that's a maximum speed of 70?
[02:04:17.368 --> 02:04:26.074]  You know, we have to leave, by example, and other countries will follow, Alex.
[02:04:26.655 --> 02:04:32.019]  You know, if they see we're serious about cleaning up the planet,
[02:04:32.645 --> 02:04:48.576]  You know, by doing these type of things, Joe, cleaning up our own house, and cleaning up alternative sources, and finding alternative ways to use fuel and eliminate this cap and crate baloney.
[02:04:48.836 --> 02:04:49.957]  Well, let's talk about that.
[02:04:50.077 --> 02:04:54.640]  Chuck Norris, the legend, you can certainly say the legend, on the line with us.
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:56.401]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[02:05:00.751 --> 02:05:03.352]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:03.772 --> 02:05:08.713]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.093 --> 02:05:10.814]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.134 --> 02:05:15.956]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.136 --> 02:05:17.096]  How much do you want?
[02:05:17.316 --> 02:05:18.056]  When do you want it?
[02:05:18.436 --> 02:05:20.057]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:20.337 --> 02:05:21.157]  When will you need it?
[02:05:21.397 --> 02:05:23.458]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:23.598 --> 02:05:24.698]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:24.938 --> 02:05:26.279]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:26.479 --> 02:05:27.519]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:05:27.679 --> 02:05:28.860]  And you can't feed yourself?
[02:05:29.001 --> 02:05:31.543]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:34.967]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.328 --> 02:05:38.832]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.152 --> 02:05:40.133]  How much will you need?
[02:05:40.374 --> 02:05:40.974]  We don't know.
[02:05:41.275 --> 02:05:42.196]  How much do you want?
[02:05:42.376 --> 02:05:43.117]  All you can get.
[02:05:43.317 --> 02:05:44.138]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:44.398 --> 02:05:47.161]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:47.441 --> 02:05:49.203]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:49.223 --> 02:05:50.144]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:05:59.753 --> 02:06:03.736]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:06:03.856 --> 02:06:06.598]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:06:06.718 --> 02:06:08.679]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:06:08.819 --> 02:06:10.941]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:06:11.061 --> 02:06:12.582]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:06:12.722 --> 02:06:17.025]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:06:17.185 --> 02:06:19.548]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[02:06:19.748 --> 02:06:25.554]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[02:06:25.774 --> 02:06:30.499]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[02:06:30.559 --> 02:06:33.302]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.

[02:06:36.125 --> 02:06:37.466]  This system is free of chemicals.
[02:06:37.466 --> 02:06:37.966]  I think so.
[02:06:59.542 --> 02:07:04.729]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:04.849 --> 02:07:09.255]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:09.395 --> 02:07:11.238]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:11.658 --> 02:07:13.020]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:14.322]  There is a solution.
[02:07:14.542 --> 02:07:22.569]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:07:22.969 --> 02:07:30.055]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[02:07:36.481 --> 02:07:42.066]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[02:08:06.323 --> 02:08:06.964]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.645 --> 02:08:08.687]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.408 --> 02:08:10.549]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:11.170 --> 02:08:11.991]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.752 --> 02:08:13.734]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.315 --> 02:08:17.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.501 --> 02:08:22.566]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.934 --> 02:08:27.376]  We've got Chuck Norris with us until the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:28.397 --> 02:08:32.360]  We are live on the 14th day of December 2009 on this Monday.
[02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:33.641]  A bunch of subjects.
[02:08:33.661 --> 02:08:38.324]  We're going to go over government takeover of health care, Climategate, the
[02:08:38.886 --> 02:08:41.467]  Copenhagen meeting that's happening right now.
[02:08:42.267 --> 02:08:44.107]  We're going to talk about so many other issues.
[02:08:44.127 --> 02:08:49.148]  Also, we're going to talk about Kickstart for kids and the website.
[02:08:49.168 --> 02:08:51.129]  In fact, Chuck, let's let's do that right now.
[02:08:51.149 --> 02:08:55.090]  I mean, you're such a humble person, but you do so much for children around the country.
[02:08:55.550 --> 02:09:01.311]  Tell us out of the gates how folks can get involved with the Kickstart program and the different websites they can visit.
[02:09:01.491 --> 02:09:08.185]  Well, kickstartkids.org is our organization where we teach the martial arts in the inner city middle schools.
[02:09:08.666 --> 02:09:10.670]  I started this 17 years ago, Alex.
[02:09:11.673 --> 02:09:14.976]  And currently we have 6,500 kids in our program.
[02:09:15.036 --> 02:09:19.019]  We have graduated over 60,000 kids over the last 17 years.
[02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:23.083]  And most of these kids going on to college and becoming successful in their own right.
[02:09:23.383 --> 02:09:32.711]  And they would tell you if they would ever talk to you that the Kickstart program is what saved them from going to prison or possibly being killed because it got them out of gangs.
[02:09:32.931 --> 02:09:37.735]  See, the thing is to be in our program, you no longer have to, you cannot be in gangs.
[02:09:38.255 --> 02:09:39.957]  And, you know, most of the kids, uh,
[02:09:41.657 --> 02:09:44.258]  In fact, we have a school in Plougerville, right near you.
[02:09:44.278 --> 02:09:48.480]  If you don't know where Plougerville is, it's right there.
[02:09:49.121 --> 02:09:58.005]  And anyway, Plougerville called and said, we see how successful your program is and we would like to implement it as a community program in Plougerville.
[02:09:58.526 --> 02:10:06.270]  So the community got together, opened up two schools in Plougerville, paying for it themselves.
[02:10:06.841 --> 02:10:10.504]  And it was so successful the first year that they opened up three more schools.
[02:10:10.564 --> 02:10:13.827]  So we have a total of five, all five middle schools in Pflugerville.
[02:10:14.147 --> 02:10:18.150]  And that's kind of where we're heading with our program, is getting a community involved.
[02:10:18.210 --> 02:10:20.252]  And like I say, we have kids.
[02:10:20.312 --> 02:10:24.915]  I had one young Hispanic boy, got a full scholarship to MIT.
[02:10:25.376 --> 02:10:29.519]  You know, a lot of our kids have graduated from high school, a lot like Victorians.
[02:10:30.086 --> 02:10:34.547]  Because once they start believing in themselves, Alex, then the world's the limit for them.
[02:10:34.567 --> 02:10:37.248]  They can do anything they want to do and it's been proven with our program.
[02:10:37.708 --> 02:10:39.528]  You know, the martial arts is a great tool.
[02:10:39.588 --> 02:10:40.909]  It turned my life around, Alex.
[02:10:41.309 --> 02:10:48.050]  I was an insecure, non-athletic kid when I got involved in the martial arts when I went to Korea and it just turned my whole life around.
[02:10:48.090 --> 02:10:53.231]  It raised my self-esteem and instilled that discipline and respect that I was lacking at that time.
[02:10:53.271 --> 02:10:59.473]  So I know it does work and like I say, that's my goal and that's why Gina and my wife's passion is to
[02:11:00.089 --> 02:11:03.490]  Uh, implement, uh, Kickstart all over the country one day.
[02:11:04.291 --> 02:11:05.831]  Well, it's beautiful what you're doing.
[02:11:06.011 --> 02:11:18.715]  And also, uh, you've got the official Chuck Norris fact book, a new edition, uh, out on that a perfect stocking stuffer, uh, available, uh, all over, uh, better bookstores everywhere and at amazon.com.
[02:11:19.236 --> 02:11:26.038]  Uh, and, and, uh, also, uh, I know a lot of the books and products you sell, you end up giving a lot of the proceeds also to Kickstart.
[02:11:26.138 --> 02:11:31.762]  Well, anything I do outside my entertainment world goes straight to our Kickstart Foundation.
[02:11:32.062 --> 02:11:34.703]  You know, funny about this fact thing, this started about four years ago.
[02:11:34.723 --> 02:11:46.171]  I started getting these facts on my email, you know, a few of them, and I'm reading them, and I'm thinking, hey, I said these are funny, you know, but not expecting them to go anywhere.
[02:11:46.191 --> 02:11:52.575]  Then all of a sudden, the college kids picked up on the facts, and it became a phenomenon in the universities and colleges.
[02:11:53.075 --> 02:11:56.416]  Then it filtered down to the high schools and the middle schools, and then it went global.
[02:11:56.836 --> 02:11:58.456]  Then it started going all over the world.
[02:11:58.476 --> 02:11:59.877]  Then the military picked up on it.
[02:12:00.577 --> 02:12:07.598]  And I got a call from the commander in Iraq, and he said, Chuck, these Chuck Norris facts are driving me crazy over here.
[02:12:07.919 --> 02:12:10.039]  All the troops want you to come over and visit with them.
[02:12:10.139 --> 02:12:12.860]  So, you know, I did two trips to Iraq.
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:14.000]  Chuck, do us a favor.
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:15.420]  Give us some Chuck Norris facts.
[02:12:16.421 --> 02:12:22.322]  Well, you know, Chuck Norris was bit by a cobra, and after five excruciating days, the cobra died.
[02:12:23.082 --> 02:12:25.543]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:12:42.907 --> 02:12:47.531]  And I tell him to talk about the story of this dick, how I picked him up the first time and I got him good.
[02:12:48.011 --> 02:12:51.674]  Second time I tried and he nailed me and what went on after that.
[02:12:51.754 --> 02:12:55.577]  So it's some pretty interesting stories that follow the fact there.
[02:12:55.637 --> 02:13:01.881]  And like you say, it's a good, you know, Christmastalk type book.
[02:13:02.842 --> 02:13:05.824]  Chuck, please give us a few more Chuck Norris facts from the man.
[02:13:07.185 --> 02:13:12.149]  Well, they wanted to put Chuck Norris on Mount Rushmore, but the granite wasn't tough enough for his beard.
[02:13:15.590 --> 02:13:16.692]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[02:13:16.712 --> 02:13:17.273]  What's your favorite?
[02:13:33.815 --> 02:13:34.495]  Oh, golly.
[02:13:35.216 --> 02:13:40.842]  Actually, my favorite one is one that my son, my eight-year-old son, came up with.
[02:13:41.183 --> 02:13:45.687]  He says, you know, Chuck Norris eats bullets for breakfast.
[02:13:46.208 --> 02:13:47.129]  Watch out when he burps.
[02:13:50.192 --> 02:13:52.575]  Do you know who started the Chuck Norris facts?
[02:13:52.875 --> 02:13:53.756]  Some college kid.
[02:13:53.776 --> 02:13:55.218]  Some college kid back east.
[02:13:57.315 --> 02:14:02.140]  What's the one about water?
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:05.884]  Because, I mean, everywhere I go I hear people doing Chuck Norris facts.
[02:14:05.984 --> 02:14:06.464]  I know!
[02:14:07.205 --> 02:14:13.391]  When I was in Iraq shaking hands with these troops, I shook hands with 27,000 troops over there and took pictures with all of them.
[02:14:14.012 --> 02:14:19.177]  And they'd walk up to me and say, they'd tell me a Chuck Norris fact, and they'd start laughing.
[02:14:19.637 --> 02:14:21.279]  And then they said, what's your favorite?
[02:14:21.299 --> 02:14:22.800]  And I'm like, golly, I don't know.
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:29.607]  So when I got back home, I said, maybe I should write, you know, put one out that kind of comes up with my favorite ones.
[02:14:29.627 --> 02:14:36.413]  Because, you know, after writing Black Belt Patriotism, and now I've got the addition to that book coming out next month.
[02:14:37.283 --> 02:14:42.567]  Uh, you know, it's nice to write a book where he can kind of laugh about it rather than dealing with all this.
[02:14:42.587 --> 02:14:47.692]  Well, I definitely want to get you on next month and maybe I can twist your arm for an extended interview because we're running out of time.
[02:14:47.712 --> 02:14:48.993]  We've only got 15 minutes left.
[02:14:49.033 --> 02:14:52.796]  Chuck Norris is our guest, but I'm very excited about that second book.
[02:14:52.836 --> 02:14:55.237]  I love the last one, The Black Belt Patriotism.
[02:14:55.458 --> 02:14:56.839]  Now, Chuck, moving quick here.
[02:14:57.639 --> 02:15:00.861]  Specifically, government-run health care, they want us to be dependent.
[02:15:01.341 --> 02:15:10.586]  Medicare, Medicaid cuts, $41 billion out of Medicare alone, but they're going to put more people in Medicare, and it looks like it's going to pass.
[02:15:10.646 --> 02:15:11.947]  Ron Paul was on this Friday.
[02:15:12.327 --> 02:15:15.749]  He said, unfortunately, it looks like it's probably going to pass.
[02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:24.354]  Well, let it pass, and then believe me, everyone that put their mark on that health care bill, we've got to get them out of office next year.
[02:15:25.066 --> 02:15:27.148]  You know, that's going to be my campaign.
[02:15:27.748 --> 02:15:32.232]  You know, I write weekly articles for World Health Daily, and I'm going to be hammering these guys.
[02:15:32.272 --> 02:15:36.035]  I'm going to be going after each and every one of them that passed this health care bill.
[02:15:36.355 --> 02:15:37.656]  Just think about this, Alex.
[02:15:38.076 --> 02:15:40.898]  You know, let's fix what is broken, okay?
[02:15:40.918 --> 02:15:42.860]  20% of the health care bill is broken.
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:45.222]  But leave the 80% alone.
[02:15:45.842 --> 02:15:49.185]  You know, 80% of the people are happy with their health care.
[02:15:49.685 --> 02:15:50.806]  You know, I'm happy with mine.
[02:15:51.147 --> 02:15:52.908]  So let's work on the 20% that isn't working.
[02:15:54.741 --> 02:16:00.125]  You know, rather than tearing it down, it reminds me, like, if you have a flat on your car, right?
[02:16:00.545 --> 02:16:06.029]  But you decide to change all the tires, and maybe put in a new motor, whether you need it or not.
[02:16:06.741 --> 02:16:08.622]  Yeah, I believe that's what the government's thinking here.
[02:16:08.662 --> 02:16:14.085]  Well, worse than that, they're going to take the motor out and fire machine gun bullets into it because it has a flat.
[02:16:14.345 --> 02:16:14.885]  Exactly.
[02:16:15.165 --> 02:16:17.806]  You know, and the thing is, you know, it's not going to work.
[02:16:18.027 --> 02:16:18.987]  It's not going to work.
[02:16:19.287 --> 02:16:22.209]  And there's going to be a lot of hurting people because of this.
[02:16:22.229 --> 02:16:23.829]  And that's where my heart goes out.
[02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:26.871]  My heart goes out to the people that, you know, that
[02:16:27.386 --> 02:16:29.388]  I think the biggest mistake government made
[02:16:46.716 --> 02:16:54.282]  It's using all this stimulus money to shore up AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, banks, cars, and all this stuff here.
[02:16:54.663 --> 02:17:02.369]  They should have been using all that stimulus money to shore up small business so they can begin hiring back their employees.
[02:17:02.729 --> 02:17:06.072]  You know, our country survives on 80% of small business.
[02:17:06.471 --> 02:17:06.671]  Yes.
[02:17:21.149 --> 02:17:22.869]  Well, let me throw this out at you Chuck Norris.
[02:17:22.909 --> 02:17:25.250]  Sorry to interrupt, we just have limited time.
[02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:30.851]  If Ron Paul runs for president in the next year and a half, are you going to support him?
[02:17:30.911 --> 02:17:32.071]  Are you thinking about supporting him?
[02:17:33.332 --> 02:17:36.212]  I love Ron Paul, but I have to be honest with you.
[02:17:36.672 --> 02:17:39.493]  I would like to have a younger president.
[02:17:39.873 --> 02:17:45.494]  You know, when you get in your 70s, and I'm pushing 70, you know, it's a tough grind.
[02:17:45.854 --> 02:17:49.035]  I would rather find someone like Ron Paul.
[02:17:49.508 --> 02:17:50.850]  Who can lead our country.
[02:17:50.930 --> 02:17:52.612]  I'm really still a Mike Huckabee fan.
[02:17:53.013 --> 02:17:57.039]  I really still believe that Mike Huckabee is the man to lead our country.
[02:17:57.499 --> 02:18:00.884]  And that's kind of the general consensus of the people in America.
[02:18:01.445 --> 02:18:05.110]  And I would love to have Ron Paul in a very prominent position.
[02:18:05.678 --> 02:18:06.459]  In Washington.
[02:18:06.799 --> 02:18:08.680]  What kind of position?
[02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:09.781]  Treasury Secretary?
[02:18:09.901 --> 02:18:10.922]  Yeah, something like that.
[02:18:11.522 --> 02:18:16.586]  Here's one of my favorite facts.
[02:18:16.666 --> 02:18:18.047]  America is not a democracy.
[02:18:18.407 --> 02:18:20.949]  It's a Chuck Tater ship.
[02:18:21.450 --> 02:18:24.212]  If that were true, Alex, I would go to Washington.
[02:18:24.892 --> 02:18:27.454]  I would line up every member of Congress.
[02:18:28.283 --> 02:18:33.406]  And I'd have Ron Paul, who I think is the most honest politician in Congress.
[02:18:33.807 --> 02:18:38.630]  I'd say, Ron, point out the honest and the dishonest politician.
[02:18:39.550 --> 02:18:40.651]  And we'd go down the aisle.
[02:18:40.671 --> 02:18:44.053]  Ron would say, he's honest, he's honest, this one's dishonest.
[02:18:44.374 --> 02:18:47.516]  I'd walk up to that person and I'd say, you're fired.
[02:18:47.956 --> 02:18:52.559]  And if he didn't move immediately, I'd choke him unconscious and drag him off the aisle.
[02:18:52.819 --> 02:18:54.060]  Chuck Norris is our guest.
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:56.802]  Chuck, shifting out of healthcare, obviously I agree with you.
[02:18:57.558 --> 02:19:09.805]  It's very unpopular in the polls, it's unconstitutional, the federal government's not supposed to be involved in healthcare, and we need to have recalls of these people, and we need to repeal it if they do pass it.
[02:19:10.145 --> 02:19:10.925]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:19:10.965 --> 02:19:18.669]  That's, you know, the thing is, it's going to be a very trying three more years with the Obama administration.
[02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:22.612]  I can, you know, this is just the tip of the iceberg with healthcare.
[02:19:22.832 --> 02:19:23.832]  This is just the beginning.
[02:19:24.112 --> 02:19:25.013]  If they pass this,
[02:19:25.444 --> 02:19:26.766]  Chuck Norris, since you brought that up.
[02:19:42.492 --> 02:19:50.459]  I have the headline here, EPA Threatens Command and Control, Economy to Push Climate Change Agenda, and that was in Associated Press.
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:52.882]  Another headline was Obama Threatens Command and Control.
[02:19:53.202 --> 02:20:00.248]  He's saying if the Senate doesn't ratify Copenhagen, which openly establishes global government, according to the head of the UN Bank.
[02:20:01.249 --> 02:20:02.611]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[02:20:02.991 --> 02:20:06.234]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[02:20:06.784 --> 02:20:10.985]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[02:20:11.605 --> 02:20:16.667]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[02:20:17.307 --> 02:20:19.747]  Patriotfood.com.
[02:20:19.767 --> 02:20:24.189]  135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[02:20:24.869 --> 02:20:29.590]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[02:20:30.612 --> 02:20:36.474]  And SurvivalistSeeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever.
[02:20:36.494 --> 02:20:40.596]  7,000 heirloom vegetable seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[02:20:41.016 --> 02:20:46.878]  That's over 4 pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[02:20:47.419 --> 02:20:51.240]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[02:20:51.740 --> 02:20:55.522]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[02:20:56.062 --> 02:20:58.603]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[02:20:59.935 --> 02:21:07.426]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:21:07.706 --> 02:21:13.474]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:21:13.774 --> 02:21:16.458]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:21:16.738 --> 02:21:22.661]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:21:23.002 --> 02:21:26.864]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:21:27.064 --> 02:21:32.447]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:21:32.707 --> 02:21:34.488]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:21:34.768 --> 02:21:36.148]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:21:36.528 --> 02:21:38.769]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:21:39.049 --> 02:21:43.410]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:21:43.770 --> 02:21:47.171]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.

[02:21:52.512 --> 02:21:54.613]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:21:59.505 --> 02:22:03.367]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[02:22:03.608 --> 02:22:07.750]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[02:22:07.870 --> 02:22:09.251]  You get less for your money.
[02:22:09.451 --> 02:22:15.295]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[02:22:18.037 --> 02:22:19.118]  800-686-2237 extension 135.

[02:22:21.621 --> 02:22:25.024]  Don't let the government strip their buying power with wasteful spending.
[02:22:25.184 --> 02:22:27.947]  Gold has a 5,000 year track record as money.
[02:22:28.287 --> 02:22:29.668]  Real money you can count on.
[02:22:29.909 --> 02:22:32.391]  No government backed paper currency comes close.
[02:22:32.791 --> 02:22:35.114]  Ask me about the protection of private gold.
[02:22:35.374 --> 02:22:38.036]  Call Peter May at Midas Resources 800-686-2237.
[02:22:41.661 --> 02:22:42.081]  Thank you.

[02:24:00.686 --> 02:24:01.286]  I think?
[02:24:18.894 --> 02:24:26.957]  That they were taking 14-year-olds to a dorm with beds, and I had stations got angry when I played the audio tapes.
[02:24:27.237 --> 02:24:31.519]  This person is now the school czar, teaching 14-year-olds.
[02:24:31.959 --> 02:24:34.160]  Even if it was heterosexual, it's pedophilia.
[02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:36.421]  It doesn't matter what, heterosexual, homosexual.
[02:24:36.721 --> 02:24:42.584]  The thing is, that's too young to be a... Well, why are they allowed to engage, basically, in pedophilia?
[02:24:44.865 --> 02:24:45.305]  Oh, golly.
[02:24:46.761 --> 02:24:47.602]  I don't know why they are.
[02:24:48.002 --> 02:24:48.902]  I mean, it's sickening.
[02:24:49.103 --> 02:24:50.784]  It's absolutely sickening.
[02:24:51.244 --> 02:24:52.405]  And that's what they want.
[02:24:52.465 --> 02:24:56.087]  They want a free society where anything goes.
[02:24:56.227 --> 02:24:57.728]  I mean, George Soros, he loves that.
[02:24:57.768 --> 02:24:59.730]  He wants a free society in our country.
[02:25:00.470 --> 02:25:03.572]  And I really believe he's the power behind it all.
[02:25:03.652 --> 02:25:08.696]  And I really believe that that's the direction they're going, is having America as a free society.
[02:25:09.296 --> 02:25:15.281]  And, you know, you can do pedophilia, you can do whatever you want, which will be okay.
[02:25:15.561 --> 02:25:17.323]  There's not going to be a crime about it.
[02:25:17.983 --> 02:25:20.666]  Well, yeah, NAMBLA is an official part of the UN.
[02:25:20.706 --> 02:25:22.387]  They're a non-governmental organization.
[02:25:22.707 --> 02:25:25.590]  That's the North American Man-Boy-Love Association.
[02:25:25.690 --> 02:25:31.735]  I don't hate any of the groups out there for their sexual preference or whatever, but I do hate NAMBLA.
[02:25:32.055 --> 02:25:33.636]  I do hate NAMBLA going after children.
[02:25:33.696 --> 02:25:33.997]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:25:34.017 --> 02:25:34.237]  I do.
[02:25:34.537 --> 02:25:38.000]  No, I have a lot of friends that are homosexuals, gays.
[02:25:38.662 --> 02:25:41.244]  And that's not the concern of mine.
[02:25:41.704 --> 02:25:43.225]  If that's their lifestyle, fine.
[02:25:43.485 --> 02:25:44.706]  But going after people's kids?
[02:25:44.906 --> 02:25:48.289]  Yeah, going after people's kids, that's a whole different animal.
[02:25:48.929 --> 02:25:51.911]  And God forbid anyone ever come after my children.
[02:25:52.792 --> 02:25:57.315]  I would spend the rest of my life in jail because I would pulverize them.
[02:25:59.458 --> 02:26:00.498]  And any good parent would.
[02:26:01.159 --> 02:26:03.399]  You brought up during the break what you're really upset about.
[02:26:03.419 --> 02:26:04.640]  I said, what's most concerning?
[02:26:04.660 --> 02:26:08.641]  You talked about Californians trying to pass laws to restrict homeschooling.
[02:26:08.701 --> 02:26:13.782]  Germany arrests you if you won't send your children to their indoctrination.
[02:26:14.022 --> 02:26:16.183]  Yeah, they've actually pulled children out of homeschools.
[02:26:16.223 --> 02:26:19.504]  They're trying to keep you from having homeschooled there in Germany.
[02:26:20.423 --> 02:26:34.074]  I've read blogs where parents have gone to jail because they would not let their kids go to a public school and learn about homosexuality and free sex and how to do it.
[02:26:35.976 --> 02:26:37.497]  What's our world coming to, Alex?
[02:26:38.058 --> 02:26:43.262]  It's so depressing to see the decadence that's going on.
[02:26:43.826 --> 02:26:46.267]  Not only in our country, but all over the world.
[02:26:46.707 --> 02:26:48.068]  Well, whatever happened to innocence?
[02:26:48.088 --> 02:26:53.730]  Just leaving kids alone to have a good time and not turn them into adults or not turn them into perverts.
[02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:54.251]  Look at this.
[02:26:54.311 --> 02:26:55.151]  At 12 years of age.
[02:26:55.671 --> 02:26:57.092]  Guys, punch up Maury Strong.
[02:26:57.132 --> 02:26:58.492]  I want people to see that quote.
[02:26:58.713 --> 02:27:00.613]  You talked about how they want to destroy our society.
[02:27:00.653 --> 02:27:05.556]  Maury Strong, the head of the UN Environment Program, involved with the Oil for Food Program.
[02:27:05.896 --> 02:27:07.757]  He's now been indicted.
[02:27:07.797 --> 02:27:08.337]  He's in trouble.
[02:27:08.637 --> 02:27:12.999]  He said, is it the only hope for the planet that the industrial civilizations collapse?
[02:27:13.619 --> 02:27:15.661]  Isn't it our responsibility to bring that about?
[02:27:15.901 --> 02:27:17.962]  He said that in 92 at the UN.
[02:27:18.002 --> 02:27:21.945]  He said carbon taxes are to destroy the economy.
[02:27:22.166 --> 02:27:25.288]  They want to bankrupt the economy and make us dependent on them.
[02:27:25.348 --> 02:27:27.329]  And that's everything you're fighting against, Chuck.
[02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:28.610]  And that's what's so exciting.
[02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:30.031]  That's what they want to do here.
[02:27:30.292 --> 02:27:32.954]  They want to bankrupt our economy here in the United States.
[02:27:33.494 --> 02:27:37.517]  And then come with a universal coin, universal money, international money.
[02:27:38.155 --> 02:27:44.480]  And take away the dollar we have here in America and everyone use the international currency.
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:47.622]  And I see that just like North Korea.
[02:27:47.682 --> 02:27:50.464]  North Korea just implemented changing the currency there.
[02:27:50.704 --> 02:27:54.527]  Well that's what's going to happen universally if we don't do something about it.
[02:27:55.087 --> 02:27:57.069]  Chuck, in closing let me ask you this.
[02:27:58.465 --> 02:28:18.847]  I've had a lot of national media here the last week, and I play them clips of the head of the EU, head of the UN calling for global government, Al Gore, I give them the treaty, the Copenhagen Treaty, that states global government, a 2% tax on everything, which they're now promoting, Pelosi and others are, all these other taxes, and they tell me it doesn't exist,
[02:28:20.006 --> 02:28:21.387]  That's a mind game, isn't it?
[02:28:21.487 --> 02:28:23.108]  It's all a mind game, Alex.
[02:28:23.609 --> 02:28:24.409]  It's all a mind game.
[02:28:24.670 --> 02:28:26.431]  You know, they say, well, we want to help the poor country.
[02:28:26.791 --> 02:28:28.773]  We have poor people in our own country.
[02:28:29.273 --> 02:28:31.575]  You know, a lot of our kids are inner-city kids.
[02:28:31.995 --> 02:28:36.358]  You know, they won't have a Christmas this year because they have no money.
[02:28:37.019 --> 02:28:41.142]  And the thing is, why aren't we helping the poor in our own country?
[02:28:41.522 --> 02:28:46.626]  And helping them be able to enjoy the luxuries of what we have in this country.
[02:28:46.646 --> 02:28:48.227]  This is what irritates the economy.
[02:28:48.795 --> 02:28:53.579]  It's all the money we send overseas, trying to help them out, and they don't even appreciate it.
[02:28:53.859 --> 02:28:55.700]  Let's give it to the people in our own country.
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:59.383]  Well, I agree, Chuck Norris, but... Alex... But, Chuck, it's worse!
[02:28:59.663 --> 02:29:04.827]  The eugenicists, the White House scientists are... They say the carbon taxes are about starving the third world.
[02:29:05.067 --> 02:29:10.231]  These carbon cuts in the treaty will just kill millions of starvation a year, conservatively.
[02:29:10.451 --> 02:29:10.611]  Yeah.
[02:29:11.412 --> 02:29:11.612]  Yeah.
[02:29:12.612 --> 02:29:15.975]  Well... You know, I just believe charity begins at home, and...
[02:29:16.841 --> 02:29:26.513]  I just hope the people see what is going on and just not sit home and say, whatever happens will happen.
[02:29:26.553 --> 02:29:29.758]  It's not the way it should be.
[02:29:30.178 --> 02:29:31.820]  I'm very concerned about it.
[02:29:32.754 --> 02:29:35.816]  You know, it's almost like, uh, if you do it, I'll do it.
[02:29:36.176 --> 02:29:37.877]  No, you do it first and then I'll do it.
[02:29:37.917 --> 02:29:44.321]  You know, it's like, nobody, everybody, no one will step up unless someone else does.
[02:29:44.682 --> 02:29:49.705]  But I really believe, I really believe that we, the United States, have to start leading as an example.
[02:29:50.846 --> 02:29:53.868]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.888 --> 02:29:57.470]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.219 --> 02:30:04.461]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:04.761 --> 02:30:05.361]  Number one.
[02:30:05.661 --> 02:30:08.822]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.103 --> 02:30:09.663]  Number two.
[02:30:09.963 --> 02:30:14.505]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:14.845 --> 02:30:15.305]  It's true.
[02:30:15.585 --> 02:30:20.147]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.447 --> 02:30:21.008]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.288 --> 02:30:24.571]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:24.872 --> 02:30:28.616]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:28.796 --> 02:30:29.336]  Number 4.
[02:30:29.577 --> 02:30:31.959]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.339 --> 02:30:35.743]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.023 --> 02:30:36.244]  Number 5.
[02:30:36.804 --> 02:30:40.725]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:40.945 --> 02:30:45.727]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.007 --> 02:30:50.048]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.168 --> 02:30:51.749]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:00.612 --> 02:31:03.214]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:03.614 --> 02:31:08.578]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:08.939 --> 02:31:10.680]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:15.824]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.004 --> 02:31:16.925]  How much do you want?
[02:31:17.165 --> 02:31:17.926]  When do you want it?
[02:31:18.286 --> 02:31:19.887]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:20.187 --> 02:31:21.007]  When will you need it?
[02:31:21.248 --> 02:31:23.329]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:23.449 --> 02:31:24.570]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:26.131]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:26.331 --> 02:31:31.394]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:31.594 --> 02:31:34.776]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:35.177 --> 02:31:38.639]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:38.999 --> 02:31:39.980]  How much will you need?
[02:31:40.200 --> 02:31:40.840]  We don't know.
[02:31:41.120 --> 02:31:42.021]  How much do you want?
[02:31:42.221 --> 02:31:42.962]  All you can get.
[02:31:43.162 --> 02:31:44.002]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:44.242 --> 02:31:47.024]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:31:47.304 --> 02:31:49.926]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:31:50.146 --> 02:31:50.947]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:59.560 --> 02:32:04.747]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:32:04.867 --> 02:32:09.233]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:32:09.393 --> 02:32:11.256]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:32:11.676 --> 02:32:13.038]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:32:13.298 --> 02:32:14.340]  There is a solution.
[02:32:14.560 --> 02:32:22.567]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:32:22.987 --> 02:32:30.053]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[02:32:36.498 --> 02:32:42.063]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:32:42.483 --> 02:32:46.308]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:32:46.648 --> 02:32:53.316]  Go to E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com, or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[02:32:54.117 --> 02:32:57.441]  Click on their banner at Infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:33:07.302 --> 02:33:10.325]  Okay, finishing up with the legend Chuck Norris.
[02:33:10.345 --> 02:33:12.467]  There's two people we can say are a legend.
[02:33:13.729 --> 02:33:16.932]  The best-selling book is the official Chuck Norris fact book.
[02:33:17.312 --> 02:33:20.696]  You can get it for $12.99 at Amazon.com or even less.
[02:33:20.736 --> 02:33:21.677]  Great stocking stuffer.
[02:33:22.097 --> 02:33:24.600]  And all the proceeds of that go to a really good cause.
[02:33:25.220 --> 02:33:29.601]  And that, of course, is the kickstart program with youth all over the country.
[02:33:29.641 --> 02:33:34.362]  And you do teach them discipline, teach them self-respect, teach them self-control.
[02:33:34.723 --> 02:33:36.243]  It really does save a lot of lives.
[02:33:36.603 --> 02:33:40.024]  And it's so important, all the great things Chuck Norris is doing.
[02:33:40.324 --> 02:33:43.565]  Okay, Chuck, finishing up with that point you got cut off.
[02:33:44.185 --> 02:33:46.406]  Obama, you talk about him wanting a dictatorship.
[02:33:46.806 --> 02:33:48.846]  Clearly, they are setting one up.
[02:33:49.186 --> 02:33:52.787]  Clearly, he's setting up a domestic police force he's called for.
[02:33:53.447 --> 02:33:54.628]  You talk about revolution.
[02:33:54.888 --> 02:34:00.189]  How do we get the people to stand up and say no so it doesn't get to that point?
[02:34:00.589 --> 02:34:04.190]  Well, the thing is, right now, leadership in our country is very scarce.
[02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:11.812]  You know, I think two leaders that I look up to is Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee.
[02:34:12.669 --> 02:34:23.657]  Mike Huckabee has a voice now on Fox and it's really showing because the polls are saying that he is by far the leading candidate for the Republican ticket in 2012.
[02:34:23.877 --> 02:34:34.245]  Being with Mike Huckabee for five months campaigning for him, I saw him as a man of integrity and honesty and really a very intelligent man.
[02:34:34.824 --> 02:34:41.166]  And he, uh, you know, he went on that tour, he never had a teleprompter, he never had no, he never had anything.
[02:34:41.486 --> 02:34:43.266]  He talked right from his heart, Alex.
[02:34:43.686 --> 02:34:44.867]  And that was very impressive.
[02:34:45.127 --> 02:34:52.049]  I saw the media confronting him with that made-up thing about that nut that the parole board said let out, and he was just so slick talking.
[02:34:52.529 --> 02:34:59.931]  Yeah, but the thing is, I mean, as he explained, that was 10 years ago, uh, the kid was 16 years old, and all he committed was burglary.
[02:35:00.376 --> 02:35:03.379]  You know, he didn't assault anyone, he didn't kill anyone.
[02:35:03.399 --> 02:35:04.941]  It was strictly a burglary.
[02:35:05.101 --> 02:35:08.265]  Well, it does show the media is scared of Huckabee, that's why they... Oh, they're scared of him.
[02:35:08.305 --> 02:35:09.045]  They're scared of him.
[02:35:09.586 --> 02:35:16.834]  And, you know, but the guy did fall between the cracks because those judges in Washington let him out after he'd committed those heinous crimes.
[02:35:17.601 --> 02:35:20.784]  And that was where the failure was in Washington.
[02:35:21.404 --> 02:35:28.850]  Well, Chuck, we're going to let you go because I know you've got a newspaper interview coming up, but on the subject of Huckabee, he has been coming out now and talking about the New World Order.
[02:35:29.191 --> 02:35:30.452]  He said it's a bad thing.
[02:35:30.912 --> 02:35:38.938]  And I think it's becoming more acceptable now to tell the truth about the UN and the globalists and George Soros, thanks to you and others speaking out.
[02:35:38.978 --> 02:35:43.662]  But I have no doubt that we're going to defeat the New World Order having Chuck Norris on our side.
[02:35:43.702 --> 02:35:45.764]  Well, we're going to survive three more years, Alex.
[02:35:46.164 --> 02:35:51.346]  And then we're going to have Mike Huckabee as President and Ron Paul as Secretary of the Treasury.
[02:35:51.586 --> 02:35:53.747]  And that way we'll keep things honest in our country.
[02:35:54.747 --> 02:35:56.808]  Thank you so much, Chuck Norris, for joining us.
[02:35:56.828 --> 02:35:57.708]  We'll talk to you next year.
[02:35:57.868 --> 02:35:58.329]  Okay, buddy.
[02:35:58.569 --> 02:35:58.849]  Bye-bye.
[02:35:59.169 --> 02:35:59.609]  God bless.
[02:35:59.709 --> 02:36:00.970]  Okay, there goes Chuck Norris.
[02:36:01.370 --> 02:36:01.990]  Take care, sir.
[02:36:03.390 --> 02:36:05.231]  Well, that was a fun interview with Chuck Norris.
[02:36:08.012 --> 02:36:10.213]  What about a Huckabee-Ron Paul ticket?
[02:36:11.733 --> 02:36:19.319]  Look, Huckabee's not perfect, but compared to George Bush and Barack Obama, my gosh, anything's good!
[02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:20.920]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:29.427]  You know, I'm just glad that Chuck Norris is going around speaking out against the New World Order.
[02:36:29.947 --> 02:36:37.934]  He's going on national TV, and when Sean Hannity said, oh, well, Ron Paul's a kook, Ron Paul's a nut, he said, well, good, I'm a nut, too.
[02:36:37.994 --> 02:36:38.454]  I like him.
[02:36:38.714 --> 02:36:40.155]  You know, he didn't betray him.
[02:36:41.818 --> 02:36:42.979]  Wasn't a doubting Thomas.
[02:36:43.459 --> 02:36:46.381]  He didn't throw Ron Paul under the bus.
[02:36:47.022 --> 02:36:50.404]  And Chuck Norris has come a long way waking up to the New World Order.
[02:36:51.345 --> 02:36:55.628]  Just like Jesse Ventura has come a long way.
[02:36:55.948 --> 02:37:00.812]  You know, talking to Chuck Norris, he talked about how over 10 years ago he heard my show and liked it in Texas.
[02:37:02.133 --> 02:37:06.096]  And Chuck knows a lot more than he's letting on, I'll tell you that.
[02:37:06.156 --> 02:37:10.759]  So he's certainly coming along, not just in his knowledge, but what he's willing to talk about.
[02:37:12.065 --> 02:37:14.226]  But he certainly does like Mike Huckabee.
[02:37:18.687 --> 02:37:20.268]  So that was an interesting interview with him.
[02:37:20.488 --> 02:37:24.770]  You know, I was about to ask him about Glenn Beck, who he goes on his show and is friendly with.
[02:37:26.470 --> 02:37:30.172]  Glenn Beck, calling for a value-added tax.
[02:37:32.152 --> 02:37:34.333]  Glenn Beck, calling for a value-added tax.
[02:37:35.134 --> 02:37:40.195]  That's exactly what the Copenhagen Global Government Treaty that will be paid directly to the IMF and World Bank.
[02:37:40.235 --> 02:37:41.396]  We now have the treaty.
[02:37:44.122 --> 02:37:55.948]  It's on record, Associated Press, London Guardian, that IMF World Bank will run the treaty and so developing countries boycott UN climate talks because the UN is to lose its power.
[02:37:56.168 --> 02:37:57.429]  The UN never had any power.
[02:37:57.449 --> 02:37:58.850]  It was always a front for banks.
[02:37:59.210 --> 02:38:03.692]  It was a debating society to get all the third world countries together so they could be bought off and paid off.
[02:38:04.092 --> 02:38:11.416]  Guys, will you pull up again the clip of Bill O'Reilly
[02:38:16.566 --> 02:38:26.151]  This is Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck talking about how they want national sales taxes and value-added taxes.
[02:38:27.071 --> 02:38:37.056]  Over a decade, I've told you, because I read the official government plans, the Council on Foreign Relations publications, you're going to have a national sales tax that is graduated.
[02:38:38.118 --> 02:38:38.818]  So it's fair.
[02:38:39.458 --> 02:38:40.439]  Some will be exempt.
[02:38:40.719 --> 02:38:43.260]  But there's going to be fraud with people buying black market.
[02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:46.500]  So you're going to have to thumbprint and swipe a card to buy and sell.
[02:38:46.801 --> 02:38:49.601]  That will also be your carbon tax credit.
[02:38:50.121 --> 02:38:51.522]  I've told you that for more than a decade.
[02:38:51.962 --> 02:38:56.023]  Because I'm reading directly from the CFR and Rand Corporation and others plans.
[02:38:58.604 --> 02:38:58.964]  I haven't
[02:39:00.009 --> 02:39:01.450]  Forgotten more than I know.
[02:39:01.870 --> 02:39:03.331]  Forgotten more than most people know.
[02:39:03.812 --> 02:39:10.937]  It's that I've... I read this Rand Corporation plan about federalizing all police and putting federal death squads on the streets.
[02:39:13.098 --> 02:39:15.920]  And ten years from now, it will just be knowledge that I have.
[02:39:16.901 --> 02:39:19.983]  And I'll have to reach back into my memory to even remember where I got it.
[02:39:21.764 --> 02:39:24.086]  They write about what's already been covertly set up here.
[02:39:26.656 --> 02:39:30.598]  But the issue here is, people ask why I don't like Glenn Beck.
[02:39:30.679 --> 02:39:34.261]  Because the establishment is keeping their friends close, their enemies closer.
[02:39:34.881 --> 02:39:37.103]  At key points, Beck attacks Ron Paul.
[02:39:37.583 --> 02:39:39.544]  At key points, he says there are no FEMA camps.
[02:39:39.904 --> 02:39:44.507]  At key points, he says the MIAC, Homeland Security, reports saying veterans and gun owners are terrorists.
[02:39:44.667 --> 02:39:45.488]  Might be reasonable.
[02:39:46.268 --> 02:39:51.051]  At key points, he gets your confidence and then he sabotages.
[02:39:52.812 --> 02:39:55.474]  And when I saw Nancy Pelosi last week,
[02:39:57.646 --> 02:40:01.787]  Many see VAT option as cure for runaway deficits.
[02:40:01.807 --> 02:40:03.088]  Give me a close shot of this, please.
[02:40:04.148 --> 02:40:12.611]  This is the Gainesville Sun, and you can look up all these other Republicans and Democrats saying, oh yes, the way to get us out of this deficit is more taxes.
[02:40:13.611 --> 02:40:13.871]  No.
[02:40:14.551 --> 02:40:16.852]  The average federal employee's money's gone up.
[02:40:17.272 --> 02:40:21.394]  The government tripled under Bush, has more than tripled in the first year under Obama.
[02:40:23.837 --> 02:40:25.318]  They want to destroy the economy.
[02:40:25.378 --> 02:40:27.420]  As Chuck Norris just said, I have their own documents.
[02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:29.502]  I just read to you what Maurice Strong said.
[02:40:30.222 --> 02:40:32.144]  But here's Nancy Pelosi calling for it.
[02:40:32.444 --> 02:40:41.532]  Now in this seven minute clip, I don't have time to play the whole thing, you can go watch it at InfoWars.com if you want, and the article Kurt Nemo wrote, Beck O'Reilly called for more taxation.
[02:40:42.791 --> 02:40:46.532]  They start talking about, oh, the liberals don't like you.
[02:40:46.552 --> 02:40:48.232]  Oh, I'm proposing taxes.
[02:40:48.752 --> 02:40:50.713]  Oh, I wonder why the liberals had you on ABC.
[02:40:50.793 --> 02:40:56.214]  And it's all about the celebrity of Beck and how much these two egomaniacs on TV together.
[02:41:01.695 --> 02:41:05.176]  And I just can't understand how they completely sell their souls out for money and power.
[02:41:06.636 --> 02:41:12.497]  There's nothing wrong with money and power if you got it through telling the truth, doing the right thing, and not being an evil person.
[02:41:13.092 --> 02:41:17.016]  But it's not what you're supposed to worship and do anything for.
[02:41:17.056 --> 02:41:24.723]  I mean, Glenn Beck and O'Reilly with the words they use and the terms they use about tightening our belts and discipline.
[02:41:25.343 --> 02:41:27.726]  Discipline is giving the government more taxes.
[02:41:28.126 --> 02:41:32.450]  Officially setting up a federal and value-added tax over everything.
[02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:34.792]  Federal inspectors in more of your lives.
[02:41:35.092 --> 02:41:36.534]  Two more IRS's.
[02:41:39.176 --> 02:41:47.683]  And then, I said last week, I said, watch, you're gonna watch value-added and sales taxes proposed during a financial crisis in the next year.
[02:41:48.363 --> 02:41:50.405]  And because I read it in the treaty.
[02:41:50.725 --> 02:41:53.848]  What you read in a UN treaty is what happens, Jack.
[02:41:54.508 --> 02:42:05.337]  Even if the Senate doesn't ratify it, by fiat, they will pass all the tax laws to get in line with it, all the laws piecemeal to get like an erector set or Legos.
[02:42:05.817 --> 02:42:07.479]  They will put it all together in pieces,
[02:42:09.073 --> 02:42:10.254]  And what is in the treaty?
[02:42:10.994 --> 02:42:13.115]  A value-added tax of 2%.
[02:42:14.315 --> 02:42:16.116]  What did Lord Monckton tell you last week?
[02:42:16.396 --> 02:42:20.938]  What did I read out of the treaty here on air?
[02:42:21.198 --> 02:42:21.639]  Here it is.
[02:42:22.299 --> 02:42:22.899]  Here's the treaty.
[02:42:24.860 --> 02:42:25.400]  What does it have?
[02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:28.482]  A 2% flat tax on all air travel.
[02:42:28.882 --> 02:42:30.582]  A 30% tax on all coal.
[02:42:30.843 --> 02:42:34.244]  A 2% value-added right off the top of the GDP.
[02:42:35.285 --> 02:42:35.805]  It's all in
[02:42:36.866 --> 02:42:43.914]  The Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is a convention, like the Continental Convention, like the Constitution.
[02:42:46.056 --> 02:42:48.158]  This is their global government total takeover.
[02:42:48.318 --> 02:42:52.263]  They've built the platform, they've got the rocket fueled, they're launching the rocket.
[02:42:52.683 --> 02:42:54.385]  They're launching the New World Order right now.
[02:42:55.330 --> 02:42:59.033]  The greatest time to ever be alive, folks, because these people are eugenicists.
[02:42:59.073 --> 02:43:03.857]  They want to cut your resources off so they can socially engineer you and take your kids.
[02:43:04.097 --> 02:43:05.459]  Chuck Norris has finally gotten it.
[02:43:05.819 --> 02:43:06.219]  Completely.
[02:43:06.239 --> 02:43:07.700]  He understands it's about taking your kids.
[02:43:08.061 --> 02:43:10.002]  It's about the state ending the family.
[02:43:11.524 --> 02:43:17.389]  Folks, the Illuminati during the French Revolution, this is on record, tried to go to a 10-day work week.
[02:43:17.669 --> 02:43:18.650]  10 days out of the week.
[02:43:19.751 --> 02:43:20.311]  What was it like?
[02:43:20.391 --> 02:43:21.632]  Nine months out of the year.
[02:43:21.892 --> 02:43:23.294]  They tried to abolish the family.
[02:43:23.354 --> 02:43:23.754]  It failed.
[02:43:24.742 --> 02:43:25.644]  China tried that.
[02:43:26.024 --> 02:43:29.049]  These people are the same group, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:29.149 --> 02:43:29.750]  It's real.
[02:43:30.210 --> 02:43:31.212]  You better wake up.
[02:43:31.292 --> 02:43:32.193]  They mean business.
[02:43:34.476 --> 02:43:35.418]  You expect me to talk?
[02:43:35.538 --> 02:43:37.341]  No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[02:43:37.721 --> 02:43:38.743]  They want you dead.
[02:43:38.803 --> 02:43:39.524]  You understand that?
[02:43:41.457 --> 02:43:42.959]  They want your family broken up.
[02:43:43.359 --> 02:43:47.803]  That's why they give men ridiculous expectations, women ridiculous expectations.
[02:43:48.124 --> 02:43:49.945]  Everybody thinks they're supposed to be a movie star.
[02:43:50.346 --> 02:43:54.590]  Everybody feels inadequate because they never became movie stars.
[02:43:54.750 --> 02:44:01.697]  Madison Avenue first makes you feel weak and insecure, then they can sell you with what will supposedly fulfill you.
[02:44:02.597 --> 02:44:05.419]  When the truth is, I've been in big movies with big movie stars.
[02:44:05.899 --> 02:44:08.141]  The truth is, I've hung out with people you wouldn't believe.
[02:44:08.461 --> 02:44:10.603]  The truth is, I've seen things you wouldn't believe.
[02:44:10.963 --> 02:44:18.389]  The truth is, because I took action against the New World Order, and most people were too timid to do it, it's taken me to very high mountains.
[02:44:19.970 --> 02:44:22.712]  I've been taken up to the mountain and offered great power by the system.
[02:44:24.053 --> 02:44:27.615]  But because I was offered the great power, I realized it was crap!
[02:44:27.935 --> 02:44:28.876]  It meant nothing!
[02:44:28.996 --> 02:44:29.917]  It means nothing!
[02:44:30.891 --> 02:44:34.853]  Money means something if your car isn't running and you can't feed your family.
[02:44:35.233 --> 02:44:36.734]  It's very important up to that point.
[02:44:37.094 --> 02:44:48.619]  Once you're comfortable, let me tell everybody out there, the yuppies who think they need more, more, more, that they'd be fulfilled if they had the newest iPod or if they had the newest car, it means nothing.
[02:44:48.899 --> 02:44:56.522]  What matters is that you're an honorable person and that you help other people and that you understand you're part of the species and part of a continuum.
[02:44:57.442 --> 02:44:59.163]  And that there's evil that has to be faced.
[02:45:01.030 --> 02:45:02.110]  That's what will fulfill you.
[02:45:02.170 --> 02:45:06.312]  You're not fulfilled because you aren't tuned into reality.
[02:45:06.532 --> 02:45:10.274]  Your subconscious mind is hundreds of times more powerful than your conscious mind.
[02:45:10.494 --> 02:45:13.095]  Your subconscious mind knows everything that's going on.
[02:45:15.595 --> 02:45:19.557]  Everyone is a genius, but they can't focus it through their conscious lens.
[02:45:20.958 --> 02:45:22.138]  Hundreds of times stronger!
[02:45:22.873 --> 02:45:24.055]  You don't have access to that.
[02:45:24.095 --> 02:45:28.040]  You haven't trained yourself to have access to discernment, to understanding.
[02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:31.164]  And so your subconscious mind is telling you, I'm not happy.
[02:45:31.604 --> 02:45:32.385]  I don't like this.
[02:45:32.426 --> 02:45:34.168]  You may be in a $5 million mansion.
[02:45:34.408 --> 02:45:38.754]  You may have the hottest 25-year-old trophy wife prancing in on her high heels shoes.
[02:45:38.974 --> 02:45:39.675]  You're not happy.
[02:45:39.915 --> 02:45:41.037]  You know why you're not happy?
[02:45:42.034 --> 02:45:43.395]  Why isn't Tiger Woods happy?
[02:45:43.615 --> 02:45:46.137]  Why aren't all these sports people and movie stars not happy?
[02:45:46.437 --> 02:45:49.019]  Because they're not truly serving humanity.
[02:45:49.339 --> 02:45:52.281]  Now, the globalists know how to create counterfeits of serving.
[02:45:52.461 --> 02:45:58.605]  For the carbon tax, let's help the third world with all the well-meaning hippies, when it's actually meant to kill the third world.
[02:45:58.926 --> 02:46:03.409]  Of course you hide killing the third world, starving them out under siege.
[02:46:04.029 --> 02:46:06.851]  By saying, that's warfare!
[02:46:07.111 --> 02:46:08.552]  The opposite of what it really is.
[02:46:08.832 --> 02:46:10.493]  You're killing them, you say you're saving them.
[02:46:10.753 --> 02:46:14.296]  To get all the well-meaning people to serve them.
[02:46:15.677 --> 02:46:19.419]  And that's the true essence of evil, is getting good to serve you.
[02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:22.601]  Get sophisticated, get serious.
[02:46:25.003 --> 02:46:26.383]  I've said enough, I'm ranting.
[02:46:27.064 --> 02:46:28.745]  Just listen, I don't hate Glenn Beck.
[02:46:29.716 --> 02:46:33.937]  When I assess him, he looks like a completely mentally ill person.
[02:46:34.697 --> 02:46:36.538]  He looks completely screwed up.
[02:46:36.978 --> 02:46:45.821]  His eyes, he looks completely weak, completely powerless, very effeminate, but not that effeminate is bad in a woman.
[02:46:46.441 --> 02:46:50.162]  It's that male effeminate behavior.
[02:46:51.842 --> 02:46:54.103]  He just reeks disingenuousness.
[02:46:58.829 --> 02:47:02.251]  And, my God, how can people not see this man as a complete fraud?
[02:47:02.532 --> 02:47:07.015]  Not just by his wreaking evil.
[02:47:09.276 --> 02:47:15.400]  I mean, he is like a horrible goblin that sits on the left knee of Satan.
[02:47:16.761 --> 02:47:21.865]  I mean, he just comes off... My God, how can people not... I mean, same thing with Bill O'Reilly.
[02:47:23.098 --> 02:47:27.259]  I mean, just an absolutely evil, swollen up, worldly person.
[02:47:28.340 --> 02:47:30.660]  Having discernment, it's like radar beams.
[02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:31.741]  I can just look right through them.
[02:47:32.121 --> 02:47:34.242]  And I don't know how other people can't see this.
[02:47:37.723 --> 02:47:39.583]  And yes, I see how weak and bad I am.
[02:47:39.643 --> 02:47:40.143]  Don't worry.
[02:47:40.884 --> 02:47:42.664]  But we're all weak and bad.
[02:47:42.724 --> 02:47:45.025]  We're also all incredibly strong and wondrous.
[02:47:45.505 --> 02:47:48.446]  It's that I can see in me what's bad.
[02:47:49.358 --> 02:47:50.178]  And I'm ashamed of it.
[02:47:50.438 --> 02:47:54.320]  These guys, their greatest possession is their worldliness.
[02:47:56.701 --> 02:48:03.063]  And here he is, in a false, they know the mind likes to have a choice, so they give you a choice, sales tax or value-added.
[02:48:03.323 --> 02:48:11.006]  Then they talk about liberals persecuting him after, so people sit there conservative, feeling like they're part of a club with O'Reilly and Beck.
[02:48:11.046 --> 02:48:17.909]  I mean it's, and they're like egomaniacs sparring with each other over, oh you're stealing my stuff, when it's on record that Beck,
[02:48:18.573 --> 02:48:23.195]  Takes what we do, and then tries to mimic it, only to fool the public that's waking up.
[02:48:24.015 --> 02:48:26.195]  I mean, it's just horrible.
[02:48:28.796 --> 02:48:30.877]  Here is Glenn Beck, calling for taxes.
[02:48:30.897 --> 02:48:32.037]  Thanks for being with us.
[02:48:32.077 --> 02:48:34.398]  I'm Bill O'Reilly in the At Your Beck and Call segment.
[02:48:34.418 --> 02:48:36.219]  Tonight, a shocking development.
[02:48:36.899 --> 02:48:41.961]  Fox News commentator Glenn Beck, chosen by Barbara Walters as one of the most fascinating people in 2009.
[02:48:42.061 --> 02:48:42.881]  I mean, how is this news?
[02:48:42.901 --> 02:48:43.361]  Egomaniac.
[02:48:43.381 --> 02:48:43.941]  We are not kidding.
[02:48:44.501 --> 02:48:46.262]  With us, Mr. Fascination himself.
[02:48:46.952 --> 02:48:49.293]  What's not fascinating about me?
[02:49:16.616 --> 02:49:20.558]  Oh yeah, they're gonna freeze spending, and cows jump over the moon.
[02:49:21.878 --> 02:49:26.160]  Bush tripled it, Obama more than quadrupled in the first eight months.
[02:49:26.701 --> 02:49:30.682]  Eight months in, he's spent more money than all presidents before him, back to George Washington.
[02:49:31.883 --> 02:49:35.445]  Folks, they've decided to bring the country down, to rape it dry.
[02:49:36.225 --> 02:49:37.165]  Do you get that?
[02:49:38.186 --> 02:49:40.987]  All that's gonna be left is SWAT teams as a rearguard action.
[02:49:41.947 --> 02:49:42.688]  Do you understand?
[02:49:44.079 --> 02:49:45.620]  Listen, back it up a little.
[02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:46.500]  People say I edited it.
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:49.241]  He's asked, oh, I want a national sales tax.
[02:49:49.861 --> 02:49:54.604]  And then Beck says, oh, no, I want a value-added tax.
[02:49:54.924 --> 02:50:02.467]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, not just raising taxes, they want tracking taxes.
[02:50:03.413 --> 02:50:07.216]  They want IRS and Homeland Security in all your businesses.
[02:50:07.256 --> 02:50:08.537]  You think the IRS is bad?
[02:50:08.897 --> 02:50:11.279]  A national sales tax is a million times worse.
[02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:16.564]  Oh, but it's been sold for 20 years by fake conservative groups as a replacement for the income tax.
[02:50:16.844 --> 02:50:18.825]  They're not getting rid of the income tax.
[02:50:19.126 --> 02:50:23.509]  They're going to give you a carbon tax sales tax to track everything you're doing, fools.
[02:50:23.569 --> 02:50:24.690]  This is the carbon tax.
[02:50:25.311 --> 02:50:27.613]  And a value added on the GDP.
[02:50:28.013 --> 02:50:29.134]  It's in the treaty!
[02:50:31.073 --> 02:50:35.634]  I don't care if Neil Bortz on their payroll for 10 years has taught you to love it every day.
[02:50:37.575 --> 02:50:38.875]  I'm gonna come back and play the clip.
[02:50:40.376 --> 02:50:42.016]  It's the watching you get conned.
[02:50:42.396 --> 02:50:44.157]  It's the watching you get manipulated.
[02:50:44.457 --> 02:50:45.757]  Why are you so gullible?
[02:50:45.937 --> 02:50:47.418]  This isn't hard to figure out.
[02:50:47.958 --> 02:50:49.778]  What's so wrong with stupid liberals?
[02:50:50.018 --> 02:50:51.799]  What's so wrong with stupid conservatives?
[02:50:52.059 --> 02:50:53.779]  You're not conservative, you're not liberal.
[02:50:54.139 --> 02:50:56.980]  You're Kool-Aid drinking, mainstream media morons.
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:50:58.401]  Wake up, man!
[02:50:58.601 --> 02:50:59.661]  There isn't any more time!
[02:51:00.507 --> 02:51:02.788]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[02:51:02.908 --> 02:51:04.648]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[02:51:04.808 --> 02:51:06.588]  NoMoreMortgage can change your life.
[02:51:06.648 --> 02:51:07.989]  We paid off all of our bills.
[02:51:08.089 --> 02:51:10.829]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[02:51:10.869 --> 02:51:16.451]  With NoMoreMortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[02:51:16.511 --> 02:51:18.111]  Even have more money left over each month?
[02:51:18.191 --> 02:51:20.772]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[02:51:20.812 --> 02:51:21.272]  NoMoreMortgage.
[02:51:23.312 --> 02:51:24.513]  Where have they been all of our life?
[02:51:24.533 --> 02:51:27.355]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[02:51:27.375 --> 02:51:27.595]  This works.
[02:51:27.615 --> 02:51:28.316]  Call the number.
[02:51:53.012 --> 02:51:54.234]  Call now for your free CD.
[02:51:54.254 --> 02:51:54.354]  800-578-6279.
[02:51:54.374 --> 02:51:54.494]  800-578-6279.
[02:51:54.534 --> 02:51:56.917]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:56.937 --> 02:51:58.099]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:58.119 --> 02:51:59.481]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:11.187 --> 02:52:13.848]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:13.868 --> 02:52:20.069]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.249 --> 02:52:25.270]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:25.430 --> 02:52:35.412]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:35.532 --> 02:52:37.653]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:37.893 --> 02:52:39.213]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:39.473 --> 02:52:41.754]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:41.934 --> 02:52:43.774]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.054 --> 02:52:48.835]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:53:00.276 --> 02:53:00.596]  Hello.
[02:53:00.937 --> 02:53:05.340]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:10.183]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[02:53:10.504 --> 02:53:15.307]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[02:53:15.567 --> 02:53:20.191]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[02:53:20.251 --> 02:53:24.354]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[02:53:24.434 --> 02:53:28.617]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[02:53:28.818 --> 02:53:33.241]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[02:53:33.381 --> 02:53:35.323]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[02:53:35.443 --> 02:53:37.504]  I can't say enough about this book.
[02:53:37.605 --> 02:53:39.446]  Blessings to you and your family.
[02:53:39.526 --> 02:53:45.010]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[02:53:45.231 --> 02:53:48.253]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[02:53:48.633 --> 02:53:51.375]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[02:53:52.236 --> 02:53:59.441]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[02:54:06.385 --> 02:54:19.273]  So, if you want a national sales tax and a value-added tax, notice all you conservatives got fooled for the last decade, plus being taught, we gotta have a sales tax, fair tax, flat tax!
[02:54:20.908 --> 02:54:28.510]  And I would explain to you on air, no, they're going to bait and switch during an economic crisis and give you those taxes on top of the income tax.
[02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:31.151]  And it's going to be a national carbon tax.
[02:54:31.911 --> 02:54:34.032]  And it's going to track everywhere you go and what you do.
[02:54:34.832 --> 02:54:36.312]  Shut up, communist!
[02:54:37.153 --> 02:54:38.633]  I like being conned!
[02:54:39.313 --> 02:54:47.916]  And now, oh, your two icons, Bill O'Reilly, Bill O, and Glenn B, baby
[02:54:49.068 --> 02:54:54.970]  He's up there, he's gonna save you, and then they go into how the liberals are attacking them.
[02:54:55.010 --> 02:54:58.811]  See, let me tell you how you're a conservative, you raise taxes.
[02:54:58.971 --> 02:55:01.331]  Absolutely, that's incredibly conservative, Glenn.
[02:55:01.891 --> 02:55:05.032]  Yeah, we shouldn't cut the government, it's doubling or more every year.
[02:55:05.052 --> 02:55:07.653]  Yeah, no, let's just raise taxes!
[02:55:07.673 --> 02:55:09.473]  Well, of course they are!
[02:55:09.493 --> 02:55:12.274]  That's their job, is to be absurd.
[02:55:14.176 --> 02:55:20.020]  Glenn Beck is meant to come off disingenuous and slimy to everyone out there to demonize the patriot movement.
[02:55:21.501 --> 02:55:24.203]  Again, with patriots like Glenn Beck, who needs Mao Zedong?
[02:55:25.644 --> 02:55:28.566]  With libertarians like Glenn Beck, who needs Joseph Stalin?
[02:55:30.396 --> 02:55:35.982]  Let's go ahead and go back to Beck and O'Reilly, just two of the slimiest fake pundits out there together.
[02:55:54.693 --> 02:55:55.273]  I made some notes.
[02:55:55.594 --> 02:55:55.934]  Excellent.
[02:55:55.994 --> 02:55:56.814]  I actually agree with you.
[02:55:56.974 --> 02:55:59.916]  Except, I believe it should be a VAT tax.
[02:55:59.936 --> 02:56:00.477]  2% VAT.
[02:56:00.537 --> 02:56:01.637]  Value-added tax.
[02:56:01.697 --> 02:56:02.138]  No more than 2%.
[02:56:02.878 --> 02:56:05.500]  What's the difference between a sales tax and a value-added tax?
[02:56:05.740 --> 02:56:09.782]  A value-added tax goes through, or a value-added tax goes through absolutely everything.
[02:56:09.882 --> 02:56:12.344]  So it hits 2% on every piece.
[02:56:12.364 --> 02:56:14.025]  You make a car, somebody's making the radio, 2%.
[02:56:14.085 --> 02:56:18.268]  Somebody's making the... So, it hits... The corporations get it, too.
[02:56:18.288 --> 02:56:20.129]  It hits all the way along the line.
[02:56:20.149 --> 02:56:22.070]  But you remember, there's an extraordinary amount of
[02:56:22.110 --> 02:56:23.351]  Directly to the deficit.
[02:56:23.371 --> 02:56:24.331]  Just like 2% VAT, the Copenhagen
[02:56:52.910 --> 02:56:53.890]  Treaty calls for?
[02:56:53.910 --> 02:56:59.371]  That goes directly to the deficit?
[02:56:59.391 --> 02:57:07.253]  In fact, here's the PrisonPlanet.com article from last Friday before that was broadcast.
[02:57:08.593 --> 02:57:16.394]  Now EU wants global taxation, global transaction tax, to fund more bailouts.
[02:57:17.374 --> 02:57:18.595]  What's in the treaty?
[02:57:20.295 --> 02:57:20.835]  A global
[02:57:23.923 --> 02:57:27.764]  2% tax, a value-added tax on the entire GDP.
[02:57:29.585 --> 02:57:33.506]  You just watch that pass and that happen.
[02:57:33.526 --> 02:57:39.628]  You just watched Glenn Beck openly in front of you propose what's in the treaty.
[02:57:40.068 --> 02:57:42.928]  Just magically, just exactly what they're calling for.
[02:57:43.229 --> 02:57:46.029]  You would never expect it, and now you will fight for it.
[02:57:46.489 --> 02:57:51.871]  Because Glenn Beck, the one you trust, the one that'll talk about the New World Order,
[02:57:52.574 --> 02:57:53.214]  Told you so.
[02:57:55.315 --> 02:57:59.656]  And he'll also tell you there's no FEMA camps even when it's in the Wall Street Journal and Houston Chronicle.
[02:58:02.016 --> 02:58:12.579]  He'll tell you everything's fine and Ron Paul supporters are dangerous, when Ron Paul has a chance of winning, then say he's best friends with Ron Paul later to get your confidence to make sure in 2011, 2012 Ron Paul gets sabotaged.
[02:58:18.214 --> 02:58:21.236]  Benedict Arnold, the number one general of the war!
[02:58:21.857 --> 02:58:24.059]  The most winningest general against the British.
[02:58:25.660 --> 02:58:27.842]  And he was a British agent the entire time.
[02:58:28.222 --> 02:58:34.847]  And let me tell you something, if you don't know that Glenn Beck is knowingly New World Order, you need to have your head examined.
[02:58:35.448 --> 02:58:36.288]  But there he is!
[02:58:37.149 --> 02:58:38.790]  And O'Reilly, he's got the sales tax.
[02:58:38.810 --> 02:58:40.091]  Don't worry, don't argue, boys.
[02:58:40.251 --> 02:58:44.214]  We're gonna get- Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:50.411 --> 02:58:57.254]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:58:57.394 --> 02:58:59.335]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:58:59.475 --> 02:59:01.596]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:59:01.716 --> 02:59:03.216]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:59:53.557 --> 02:59:55.479]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:55.939 --> 02:59:58.721]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:03.749 --> 03:00:04.389]  Big Brother.
[03:00:05.069 --> 03:00:06.110]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:06.830 --> 03:00:07.930]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:08.590 --> 03:00:09.390]  You want answers?
[03:00:10.191 --> 03:00:11.091]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:11.731 --> 03:00:15.352]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:15.912 --> 03:00:20.013]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.434 --> 03:00:24.274]  Christopher Horner has been covering Copenhagen.
[03:00:24.294 --> 03:00:30.356]  He'll join us in the next segment to give us the latest on what's happening with the establishment of a planetary dictatorship.
[03:00:33.024 --> 03:00:36.305]  We'll be with us for 30 minutes, then we're gonna open the phones up after he leaves us.
[03:00:36.386 --> 03:00:37.546]  Phones aren't open quite yet.
[03:00:38.827 --> 03:00:39.687]  Start your engines.
[03:00:42.528 --> 03:00:44.089]  Hard to believe two hours has already passed.
[03:00:44.109 --> 03:00:45.449]  These shows just blast past us.
[03:00:46.090 --> 03:00:49.931]  Chuck Norris was on with us for about 35-40 minutes earlier in the last hour.
[03:00:50.552 --> 03:00:52.413]  That was certainly interesting and informative.
[03:00:53.573 --> 03:00:55.574]  He says Obama wants to be a dictator.
[03:00:57.242 --> 03:01:03.623]  And a whole bunch of other amazing things that the state does want to take your children and does want to bankrupt your society by design.
[03:01:05.183 --> 03:01:08.224]  Ron Paul said last Friday the health care bill is going to pass.
[03:01:08.804 --> 03:01:09.684]  I tend to agree with him.
[03:01:10.144 --> 03:01:15.125]  I wonder if I'll see some headlines at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com on that front.
[03:01:16.105 --> 03:01:23.807]  I've been really marveling over Glenn Beck and O'Reilly debating whether we need a national sales tax or value-added tax to pay off the bankers.
[03:01:24.227 --> 03:01:25.147]  And he said, don't worry.
[03:01:26.042 --> 03:01:27.803]  Every cent will go to pay down the debt.
[03:01:27.843 --> 03:01:28.203]  That's right.
[03:01:28.283 --> 03:01:33.125]  None of it goes to you, the people that pay for the socialism, because it's not socialism.
[03:01:33.165 --> 03:01:34.065]  It's pure robbery.
[03:01:34.666 --> 03:01:37.847]  You just pay massive taxes and they all go to offshore banks.
[03:01:38.407 --> 03:01:40.208]  Well, you laughed at third world countries.
[03:01:40.948 --> 03:01:45.730]  Why shouldn't you live like someone in a third world nation, raped and robbed by the IMF and World Bank?
[03:01:46.430 --> 03:01:48.051]  That is now happening.
[03:01:53.055 --> 03:01:56.538]  That is now happening right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:59.540 --> 03:02:16.554]  Now, before I go any further, because it is the season, it is the season to wake somebody up and also support this radio show, we've got combo deals where you order one of my films, you can get another film free, like Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, Reflections and Warnings with Aaron Russo.
[03:02:18.376 --> 03:02:19.717]  Or get a Follow the Republic,
[03:02:21.593 --> 03:02:24.094]  You can get a free t-shirt of your choice.
[03:02:24.274 --> 03:02:26.475]  I decided to go ahead and add more t-shirts on there.
[03:02:26.795 --> 03:02:30.116]  Not just the Obama Joker shirts, because those are selling out rapidly.
[03:02:30.316 --> 03:02:31.717]  And when those are sold out, they're sold out.
[03:02:31.957 --> 03:02:37.279]  We have them with Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, we have them with Socialist, Fascist, it's all command and control.
[03:02:37.879 --> 03:02:41.120]  We have all those t-shirts, but some sizes have sold out.
[03:02:41.921 --> 03:02:43.721]  And so it's selling out very, very quickly.
[03:02:43.741 --> 03:02:48.403]  If you want that t-shirt, go to Infowars.com, click the top banner that says free t-shirt.
[03:02:48.985 --> 03:02:52.068]  Get a Follow the Republic, or an Obama Deception, or an Endgame.
[03:02:52.328 --> 03:02:53.969]  You can get a free t-shirt of your choice.
[03:02:55.010 --> 03:03:01.556]  But I am going to stop the promotion when the Obama shirts sell out.
[03:03:02.376 --> 03:03:05.659]  Now, we'll end up with a few weird sizes of Obama at the end.
[03:03:07.381 --> 03:03:13.546]  And so, we'll keep adding other t-shirts until, so you always have some choice, some of the other great t-shirts.
[03:03:14.941 --> 03:03:17.222]  So that if you can't get an Obama, you can get something else.
[03:03:17.262 --> 03:03:22.243]  But when all the Obamas are gone, I'm getting rid of the free t-shirt deal.
[03:03:22.303 --> 03:03:25.483]  We've never had combos and specials this low.
[03:03:26.724 --> 03:03:31.225]  I mean, I've got deals that are meant to move these out the door and educate people.
[03:03:31.685 --> 03:03:34.105]  So, you haven't done your Christmas shopping yet?
[03:03:34.485 --> 03:03:40.727]  You haven't gone out and fought the horrible drunken crowds of people drinking Sailor Jerry's rum?
[03:03:42.328 --> 03:03:43.128]  Uh, why do it?
[03:03:43.308 --> 03:03:47.389]  Why not go to Infowars.com, buy the books, the DVDs, the t-shirts.
[03:03:47.689 --> 03:03:53.330]  You can create a card if you want with a message of, I want this sent to this address.
[03:03:53.670 --> 03:03:55.350]  Hey Bob, it's your cousin Bill.
[03:03:56.011 --> 03:03:57.671]  I sent you this t-shirt and video.
[03:03:57.951 --> 03:03:58.771]  Be sure you do that.
[03:03:58.811 --> 03:04:05.512]  We have some people that don't put the note every Christmas and then we end up mailing it to somebody and then they mail it back saying, I didn't order this.
[03:04:05.812 --> 03:04:08.793]  You need to, in the comment section on the shopping cart,
[03:04:10.211 --> 03:04:14.614]  Uh, you need to include the message you want so they know, or let them know it's coming.
[03:04:15.314 --> 03:04:16.515]  You know, I'm sending you a package.
[03:04:19.417 --> 03:04:23.219]  Or get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, five and a half months free right now.
[03:04:23.740 --> 03:04:28.243]  We allow people six computers to log on simultaneously with the same username and passcode.

[03:04:36.036 --> 03:04:42.880]  All these hundreds of videos and films and e-books at PrisonPlanet.TV and watch this fella's live radio slash TV show.
[03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:45.101]  Here's your PrisonPlanet.TV membership.
[03:04:45.441 --> 03:04:48.023]  And even if they don't use it, you gave yourself a gift, you can use it.
[03:04:48.323 --> 03:04:53.086]  So PrisonPlanet.TV or InfoWars.com to take advantage of that or 888-253-3139 to call.
[03:04:53.106 --> 03:04:54.406]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:59.440 --> 03:05:04.682]  Before you throw away your... This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:05:05.002 --> 03:05:05.623]  Number one.
[03:05:05.903 --> 03:05:09.064]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:09.344 --> 03:05:09.904]  Number two.
[03:05:10.205 --> 03:05:14.747]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:15.087 --> 03:05:15.547]  It's true.
[03:05:15.827 --> 03:05:20.389]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:20.709 --> 03:05:21.250]  Number 3.
[03:05:21.530 --> 03:05:24.812]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:25.113 --> 03:05:28.996]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:29.036 --> 03:05:29.576]  Number 4.
[03:05:29.816 --> 03:05:32.198]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:32.578 --> 03:05:35.981]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:36.261 --> 03:05:36.481]  Number 5.
[03:05:37.062 --> 03:05:40.985]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:05:41.205 --> 03:05:45.969]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:05:46.249 --> 03:05:50.273]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:50.413 --> 03:05:51.995]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:52.215 --> 03:05:54.297]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:05:54.477 --> 03:05:56.820]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:06:02.110 --> 03:06:05.751]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:06.071 --> 03:06:14.213]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:06:14.933 --> 03:06:18.974]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:06:19.554 --> 03:06:30.376]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:06:31.016 --> 03:06:40.018]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:40.518 --> 03:06:45.559]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:06:45.960 --> 03:06:53.141]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:53.441 --> 03:06:55.862]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[03:07:01.351 --> 03:07:04.993]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:07:05.373 --> 03:07:08.375]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:07:08.615 --> 03:07:13.398]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:07:13.418 --> 03:07:19.661]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:07:19.821 --> 03:07:22.063]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:07:22.563 --> 03:07:23.983]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:07:24.003 --> 03:07:24.724]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:07:24.744 --> 03:07:26.844]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:07:41.488 --> 03:07:43.330]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:07:43.350 --> 03:07:48.454]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[03:07:48.774 --> 03:07:58.702]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:00.604 --> 03:08:06.609]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:07.229 --> 03:08:10.192]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:10.931 --> 03:08:20.844]  Christopher Horner, over a year ago, wrote the book, Red Hot Lies, How Global Warming Alarmists Use Threats, Fraud, and Deception to Keep You Misinformed.
[03:08:20.904 --> 03:08:24.008]  See, this isn't new fraud, the climate gate.
[03:08:24.068 --> 03:08:26.351]  It just confirms that it's conscious.
[03:08:27.132 --> 03:08:28.694]  I mean, here's an example.
[03:08:29.597 --> 03:08:36.723]  They'll show you the last 50 years of warming and have the hockey stick only showing a small part of it to make it look like it's going up.
[03:08:37.103 --> 03:08:42.228]  But when you pull back, you find out it's hardly a rise compared to what's happened in previous centuries.
[03:08:43.369 --> 03:08:44.129]  And they know this.
[03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:51.515]  And they know polar bears can swim and they lie about that because they look cute and cuddly and they can scare kids saying that penguins can't swim.
[03:08:52.957 --> 03:08:54.498]  And they've been caught in a lot of other fraud.
[03:08:54.518 --> 03:08:55.579]  So we have the expert
[03:08:56.147 --> 03:09:00.740]  Who's been to six of these globalist, global government, global taxation meetings.
[03:09:01.932 --> 03:09:08.836]  And he's Christopher Horner, Red Hot Lies, How Global Warming Alarm Issues Threats, Fraud, and Deception to Keep You Misinformed, Regnery, 2008.
[03:09:09.297 --> 03:09:16.541]  And he also wrote The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming, 2007, New York Times Best Seller.
[03:09:16.561 --> 03:09:23.645]  So this is the kind of guy we like, somebody who was devastatingly accurate even before the latest information came out.
[03:09:23.665 --> 03:09:27.968]  So we're going to talk about the constitutional crisis, we're going to talk about Obama saying
[03:09:28.806 --> 03:09:29.566]  I don't care.
[03:09:30.707 --> 03:09:33.867]  I'm going to ram this, even if Congress doesn't go with this treaty.
[03:09:34.308 --> 03:09:36.188]  I'm going to have the EPA order it.
[03:09:36.968 --> 03:09:39.069]  I mean, as if he's Hitler or Joe Stalin.
[03:09:41.109 --> 03:09:48.351]  We now have the internal treaty that says the third world actually has to make double the cuts, which will actually destroy their economy.
[03:09:48.851 --> 03:09:50.932]  They suckered the third world into getting behind it.
[03:09:51.698 --> 03:09:53.239]  Well, on the international stage, Alex, it's going as expected.
[03:09:53.259 --> 03:09:55.779]  They have kicked any treaty or something that might be a treaty into next year.
[03:10:17.418 --> 03:10:25.885]  And Copenhagen will result in an historic agreement to meet again in Mexico City next year, which is how these have all turned out year after year, which is why I've stopped going.
[03:10:26.025 --> 03:10:32.730]  And this actually was supposed to be a treaty-producing conference, but months ago we realized it was not going to be.
[03:10:32.770 --> 03:10:44.920]  So, where it leaves us is, we'll get a promise of billions, we don't know how much, the demand is over $100 billion a year just from us, and the offer on the table is something under $10 billion a year from us, which is ten too many, they're even talking about three.
[03:10:45.909 --> 03:10:50.590]  Uh, to upgrade the infrastructures of countries to better compete with us.
[03:10:51.490 --> 03:11:02.653]  As we fund that upgrade through forcing our energy users to buy ration coupons, or what they're calling allowances, to use fossil fuels, hydrocarbon energy, here, for the shackling our economies.
[03:11:02.693 --> 03:11:05.853]  But, it's proceeding in the wrong direction, but at least it's going slowly.
[03:11:06.353 --> 03:11:07.914]  Let me tell you what Mexico City is now.
[03:11:08.274 --> 03:11:14.115]  The Copenhagen discussion that we had all this build-up for, has now been kicked into next December, November, in Mexico City.
[03:11:14.747 --> 03:11:16.007]  November 8th is when it begins.
[03:11:16.648 --> 03:11:21.789]  Imagine the build-up to this conference next year, when our elections are on November 2nd next year.
[03:11:22.350 --> 03:11:28.092]  Which means every Senate race has to have both candidates answer the question, will you vote to ratify Kyoto 2?
[03:11:28.332 --> 03:11:30.212]  Every single race has to confront that question.
[03:11:30.933 --> 03:11:37.755]  Every single House race must have both candidates confront the question, would you vote up or down to tell EPA they can't do this on their own?
[03:11:38.516 --> 03:11:39.877]  So we've got the international track.
[03:11:40.278 --> 03:11:41.238]  It's being delayed.
[03:11:41.559 --> 03:11:43.200]  We've got the domestic cap and trade.
[03:11:43.220 --> 03:11:44.361]  That's being delayed.
[03:11:44.941 --> 03:11:45.522]  That's good.
[03:11:46.102 --> 03:11:50.606]  The more sunshine that gets on this stuff and disinfects it, the more people see it, the more outrage they get.
[03:11:50.786 --> 03:11:53.809]  Well, Chris, let's not just glaze over the bombshell, because I should have asked.
[03:11:53.829 --> 03:12:01.435]  You are one of the leading experts, not just on the fraud of man-made global warming, or change, as they call it, when we've had climate change for four billion years.
[03:12:01.455 --> 03:12:03.417]  You're one of the leading experts on the politics
[03:12:04.157 --> 03:12:05.418]  Of this as well.
[03:12:05.438 --> 03:12:08.000]  You've been fighting this for decades.
[03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:13.724]  Specifically, you just said that Copenhagen is derailed.
[03:12:16.408 --> 03:12:18.729]  What I'm saying is, you're going to see a lot of press releases.
[03:12:18.749 --> 03:12:19.789]  You do every December.
[03:12:21.049 --> 03:12:23.250]  It's going to be a historic agreement to meet again next year.
[03:12:23.290 --> 03:12:24.911]  That's what every year has produced.
[03:12:25.431 --> 03:12:26.091]  Every conference.
[03:12:26.151 --> 03:12:28.351]  As I said, I went to a bunch of them and they became very tiresome.
[03:12:28.612 --> 03:12:30.772]  They have my picture up on the wall as a climate criminal.
[03:12:31.072 --> 03:12:33.733]  Got the hippies following me around with cameras and everything else, stealing my trash.
[03:12:34.093 --> 03:12:34.173]  Yes.
[03:12:55.717 --> 03:12:58.358]  Skittish about these issues, which is, you know, their fault.
[03:12:58.478 --> 03:12:59.258]  That's not my burden.
[03:13:00.418 --> 03:13:06.080]  That this should not be a campaign issue for everybody, and that includes those Republicans who voted for this, eight of them.
[03:13:06.560 --> 03:13:08.180]  Two of them seeking higher office, by the way.
[03:13:09.701 --> 03:13:11.081]  Yeah, let's list them.
[03:13:11.121 --> 03:13:14.242]  Let's list who's... We got Graham doing it.
[03:13:14.262 --> 03:13:17.623]  We have out of office the globalist Newt Gingrich.
[03:13:17.983 --> 03:13:20.404]  Who are the Republicans supporting this treason?
[03:13:20.884 --> 03:13:24.445]  Well, there was this guy, Mike Castle in Delaware, who's now running for the Senate seat.
[03:13:25.563 --> 03:13:34.566]  Then we've got, you can see a great town hall meeting where he gets his head handed to him by a bunch of Delawareans who do not, blue hands I guess is what you call them, I don't know what their name is, who did not care for this.
[03:13:34.847 --> 03:13:36.727]  I mean it was a wonderful moment, the look in his eye.
[03:13:37.007 --> 03:13:45.510]  He's had the easiest job in the world until they started paying attention and he voted for one too many tax increases, this being the biggest tax increase, cap and trade, in American history.
[03:13:46.051 --> 03:13:52.013]  Then you've got this guy Mark Kirk who's running for the Senate to replace this Roland Burr as Barack Obama's old seat.
[03:13:52.945 --> 03:14:02.591]  He's a Republican from the North Shore who said, well, I voted in favor of cap-and-trade because it satisfied the narrow parochial interests of my wealthy district, but I would vote to represent the whole state of Illinois.
[03:14:03.091 --> 03:14:06.613]  Well, I can't respect that kind of dance.
[03:14:06.713 --> 03:14:11.655]  That's just insulting and, you know, I don't know why that's any better than a liberal who's going to vote that way anyway.
[03:14:11.696 --> 03:14:12.536]  So is he, apparently.
[03:14:13.296 --> 03:14:14.397]  There were six other Republicans.
[03:14:14.417 --> 03:14:21.521]  There's a guy, Leonard Lance in New Jersey, who put on his website, excuse me, some people put up on their website his constituent mail.
[03:14:22.498 --> 03:14:29.583]  In which he boasts, oh, hey, don't worry, this is actually a wealth transfer from most of the rest of the country to the coastal elites.
[03:14:30.284 --> 03:14:35.408]  He said it moves money from Ohio and Pennsylvania and Missouri out to New Jersey and California.
[03:14:35.868 --> 03:14:36.368]  It does.
[03:14:36.769 --> 03:14:36.989]  Yeah.
[03:14:37.469 --> 03:14:40.411]  So we've got people who, frankly, you know, I won't miss them.
[03:14:40.672 --> 03:14:45.235]  Well, they're pirates, but there's also some other people in the Republican leadership supporting it.
[03:14:45.855 --> 03:14:49.138]  Well, Lindsey Graham is the only, well, okay, here's our problem in the Republican Senate.
[03:14:49.753 --> 03:14:55.717]  Lindsey Graham is, according to people in South Carolina, vying to be the Secretary of Defense because Robert Gates is on his way out.
[03:14:56.277 --> 03:15:04.302]  And to do so, he's ingratiating himself with the Obama administration by pushing Kevin Trey as a bit of a proxy for John McCain, who even this time is not supporting it.
[03:15:04.922 --> 03:15:07.244]  I say yet, but at least he's not supporting it.
[03:15:07.804 --> 03:15:13.108]  So Graham's working with John Kerry and Joe Lieberman to find tripartisanship on this.
[03:15:13.808 --> 03:15:15.369]  But Graham brings no one with him.
[03:15:16.132 --> 03:15:19.394]  And he's considering himself not even running for re-election, as I understand it.
[03:15:19.414 --> 03:15:19.914]  Could be wrong.
[03:15:20.755 --> 03:15:30.701]  The guy I'm more upset about is Judge Gregg, who's done nothing publicly, but quietly, from Senate sources I understand, is making noises about wanting bipartisanship uber all of them.
[03:15:30.721 --> 03:15:34.423]  It's more important that we find bipartisanship than what really is in the bill.
[03:15:34.443 --> 03:15:39.686]  You know, we're seeing that... The country is plunging into a double-dip recession, into possible depression.
[03:15:40.466 --> 03:15:48.534]  And we've got a globalist world government agreement, according to Ban Ki-moon and Herman Van Rompuy, the head of the EU.
[03:15:48.914 --> 03:15:57.823]  It openly gives 2% taxes on GDP, taxes to foreign banks, IMF World Bank to run it, a global UN authority over air travel.
[03:15:58.183 --> 03:16:03.849]  This will annihilate our economy, and we've got senators who are for it because it's a new tax.
[03:16:04.645 --> 03:16:07.628]  Yeah, we've got people who really, they've been there too long.
[03:16:07.688 --> 03:16:16.316]  Judge Wright's retiring, and he's generally a decent, as far as these things go, member of the Senate, but he thinks that bipartisanship before he leaves is very important.
[03:16:16.916 --> 03:16:17.437]  I disagree.
[03:16:17.677 --> 03:16:19.418]  This is the biggest tax increase in American history.
[03:16:19.839 --> 03:16:24.763]  The President said that the purpose of it was to cause your energy prices to, quote, necessarily skyrocket.
[03:16:25.264 --> 03:16:26.825]  That's not a side effect they're working on.
[03:16:26.925 --> 03:16:27.666]  It's the point.
[03:16:28.126 --> 03:16:28.907]  He's admitted this.
[03:16:29.625 --> 03:16:34.989]  Well, what about Maury Strong's quote in 1992 about, it's our job to destroy the industrial society?
[03:16:35.629 --> 03:16:40.412]  Maury Strong, you know, that was his fantasy of a novel character, but that's actually how he feels.
[03:16:40.792 --> 03:16:52.160]  I've testified next to him in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and you never know, he's this very unassuming looking man who holds these terrible anti-population, anti-growth, anti-development views that are pervasive among the people pushing
[03:16:53.932 --> 03:16:55.872]  Is it this really all about eugenics?
[03:16:55.912 --> 03:17:02.375]  At the bottom line, a bunch of control freaks want to be able to decide literally what you eat and what you do and how many kids you have.
[03:17:03.035 --> 03:17:03.496]  All about?
[03:17:03.836 --> 03:17:04.976]  No, but I will say this.
[03:17:04.996 --> 03:17:13.440]  The population zealots, the pro-state, the pro-tax, the anti-growth, the anti-development, anti-property rights, the persistent communists, the fallen communists,
[03:17:13.982 --> 03:17:14.923]  They're all on this.
[03:17:15.223 --> 03:17:16.764]  So I can't say it's all about that.
[03:17:16.784 --> 03:17:18.105]  The global governance types love it.
[03:17:18.625 --> 03:17:22.028]  There's a bunch of rent-seekers, GE, Duke Energy, Exelon.
[03:17:22.048 --> 03:17:34.117]  They're all looking to pick your pockets in the name of... No, no, I understand there's a giant ship of pirates, but at its core, from my research, the rationale of the big elites supporting it is we gotta cut off people's energy.
[03:17:34.517 --> 03:17:39.861]  I mean, look at the Communist Chinese last week saying, we'll sign on to this if you have a global one-child policy.
[03:17:40.581 --> 03:17:40.761]  Right.
[03:17:42.142 --> 03:17:43.083]  In fact, China even
[03:17:44.420 --> 03:17:50.847]  I think it was a year, no, two years ago in Bangkok at one of these negotiations said that they wanted to sell us carbon offsets.
[03:17:50.987 --> 03:17:52.428]  I have this in Red Hot Live, by the way.
[03:17:52.468 --> 03:17:55.351]  No one else has covered this except one public source where I found it.
[03:17:55.932 --> 03:18:03.600]  The Chinese proposed getting carbon offsets recognized under Kyoto to sell Europe and us derived from their coercive family planning policies.
[03:18:03.640 --> 03:18:04.661]  What they said, Alex, was
[03:18:05.663 --> 03:18:10.652]  Our emissions are now at X, and they would be at 1.9X if we didn't have our policies in place.
[03:18:11.052 --> 03:18:12.715]  Therefore, these are emission reductions.
[03:18:12.835 --> 03:18:13.236]  They're not.
[03:18:13.296 --> 03:18:18.565]  They're emissions avoided by rather cruel totalitarian policies.
[03:18:19.665 --> 03:18:20.666]  They wanted carbon offset.
[03:18:20.746 --> 03:18:29.733]  And the UN, this group that runs Kyoto, the UNFCCC and the Europeans, thought that was a wonderful idea because that's really what a lot of people are in this for.
[03:18:29.773 --> 03:18:30.934]  Of course, there's no doubt.
[03:18:31.594 --> 03:18:33.095]  But there's not a universal motivator.
[03:18:33.115 --> 03:18:34.597]  Remember, Enron got this thing going.
[03:18:34.977 --> 03:18:36.998]  I know this because I worked for Enron at the time.
[03:18:37.659 --> 03:18:44.844]  In 97, they told me it was my number one priority to get a global warming treaty, internationally, exempt India and China because they were building coal-fired power plants there.
[03:18:44.944 --> 03:18:46.546]  Oh, is that how you woke up, Christopher?
[03:18:47.006 --> 03:18:48.087]  That's how I got into this, yes.
[03:18:48.127 --> 03:18:49.448]  I was innocently practicing law and
[03:18:50.399 --> 03:18:57.755]  They told me that I was Director of Federal Government Relations for Enron for about three weeks, and they told me to do this, and I told them to do something else, and I reported ways.
[03:18:59.409 --> 03:19:01.591]  But yeah, that was my eye-opening experience.
[03:19:01.671 --> 03:19:04.393]  I wasn't aware that these things actually went on, believe it or not.
[03:19:04.433 --> 03:19:05.514]  Wow, you're an amazing guest.
[03:19:05.554 --> 03:19:06.375]  I'm really impressed.
[03:19:06.435 --> 03:19:16.143]  I mean, when we get back, I want to talk about Red Hot Lies and how you pegged them as how the alarm issues threats, fraud, and deception to keep you misinformed.
[03:19:16.443 --> 03:19:21.768]  I mean, you knew a year and a half ago when you were writing this, it's been out for a year, that this is a group who knowingly
[03:19:22.168 --> 03:19:23.208]  Are engaged in fraud.
[03:19:23.228 --> 03:19:25.249]  So let's look at the scientists themselves then.
[03:19:25.489 --> 03:19:29.731]  You talk about GE and big banks and big corporations wanting it to pick pockets.
[03:19:30.011 --> 03:19:31.392]  You talk about the UN wanting it.
[03:19:31.692 --> 03:19:35.173]  You talk about the no-growthers, the eugenicists wanting it.
[03:19:35.593 --> 03:19:37.134]  But who are these scientists then?
[03:19:37.174 --> 03:19:39.695]  I mean, last week we got a UN document.
[03:19:40.788 --> 03:19:46.014]  From years ago where they were directing the scientists to unify the fraud along collectivism.
[03:19:46.675 --> 03:19:49.058]  Amazing to have Christopher Horner on with us.
[03:19:49.078 --> 03:19:50.419]  I didn't read through his whole bio.
[03:19:50.920 --> 03:19:56.226]  It's quite amazing and we'll be right back on the other side of this quick break.
[03:19:56.246 --> 03:19:57.428]  We'll tell you where to get the book as well.
[03:19:59.398 --> 03:20:00.579]  Heart-related health problem.
[03:20:17.079 --> 03:20:17.419]  We're good to go!
[03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:50.450]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:20:50.610 --> 03:20:52.830]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:20:53.030 --> 03:20:54.471]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[03:21:11.318 --> 03:21:13.880]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:13.901 --> 03:21:20.126]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:20.306 --> 03:21:25.351]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:25.371 --> 03:21:35.480]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:35.600 --> 03:21:37.702]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:37.942 --> 03:21:39.263]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:39.523 --> 03:21:41.805]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.005 --> 03:21:43.826]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:44.126 --> 03:21:48.850]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:49.270 --> 03:21:54.034]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:21:54.274 --> 03:21:58.397]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:00.456 --> 03:22:10.198]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:22:10.478 --> 03:22:16.519]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[03:22:16.919 --> 03:22:25.761]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[03:22:26.141 --> 03:22:35.050]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[03:22:35.331 --> 03:22:39.915]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[03:22:39.935 --> 03:22:41.497]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:41.737 --> 03:22:44.240]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[03:22:44.520 --> 03:22:47.682]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[03:22:47.842 --> 03:22:51.685]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[03:22:52.025 --> 03:22:52.885]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[03:22:52.906 --> 03:22:53.266]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.109 --> 03:23:02.351]  This is an emergency alert.
[03:23:02.871 --> 03:23:04.934]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[03:23:05.294 --> 03:23:08.298]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[03:23:08.839 --> 03:23:13.084]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[03:23:13.625 --> 03:23:18.792]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[03:23:19.352 --> 03:23:23.595]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[03:23:23.855 --> 03:23:29.879]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[03:23:30.299 --> 03:23:31.540]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[03:23:31.960 --> 03:23:38.064]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[03:23:38.424 --> 03:23:40.065]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[03:23:40.325 --> 03:23:40.725]  I think so.
[03:24:04.749 --> 03:24:10.190]  Our guest is a pretty heavy hitter.
[03:24:10.270 --> 03:24:11.551]  Big lawyer for Enron.
[03:24:11.571 --> 03:24:12.731]  Testifies before Congress.
[03:24:12.771 --> 03:24:13.612]  Best-selling author.
[03:24:13.632 --> 03:24:14.832]  Christopher Horner.
[03:24:14.932 --> 03:24:15.812]  Red hot lies.
[03:24:16.272 --> 03:24:17.493]  Global warming alarmists.
[03:24:17.913 --> 03:24:20.414]  Use threats, fraud, and deception to keep you misinformed.
[03:24:20.734 --> 03:24:22.215]  He'll be with us till 50 after.
[03:24:22.235 --> 03:24:26.096]  He was just telling me about a big shell.
[03:24:27.097 --> 03:24:31.679]  Head meeting with the Rockefellers and an inside baseball Al Gore story.
[03:24:31.939 --> 03:24:37.862]  Then I want to get into the premeditated fraud of these people and what their agenda really is.
[03:24:38.082 --> 03:24:38.962]  Christopher, continue.
[03:24:39.863 --> 03:24:45.865]  Oh, well, I was discussing somebody who will remain nameless who used to be with an oil company who's now pushing the global warming agenda.
[03:24:45.885 --> 03:24:46.586]  A very nice guy.
[03:24:46.606 --> 03:24:50.067]  I've debated him on several occasions, but very wrong on the issues.
[03:24:50.528 --> 03:24:51.828]  And I don't understand where he's coming from.
[03:24:51.848 --> 03:24:55.670]  But anyway, he told me he met with one of the deep pockets for this, and you mentioned
[03:24:56.686 --> 03:25:03.515]  Uh, funding the alarmist activities and that they said, you know, Gore's killing us and we got to get around him.
[03:25:03.535 --> 03:25:10.185]  And I told him, how do you get around the guy who's bragging he got $300 million from someone to rebrand global warming into climate crisis?
[03:25:10.839 --> 03:25:11.479]  He really does radiate
[03:25:31.906 --> 03:25:33.728]  A type of demonic nelliness.
[03:25:33.768 --> 03:25:39.132]  I don't know how to describe it, but everyone I know just cringes when they see him on television.
[03:25:39.172 --> 03:25:43.295]  Just the arrogant, almost lizard-like look on his face.
[03:25:44.556 --> 03:25:45.757]  Here's the thing.
[03:25:46.738 --> 03:25:53.743]  He, scripted, tries to navigate the waters of dishonesty with word choice and things like this.
[03:25:55.104 --> 03:25:58.107]  He's clearly read the UK High Court opinion, which threw out every claim.
[03:25:58.147 --> 03:26:01.129]  And then when he's unscripted, on the rare moment, he's challenged.
[03:26:01.829 --> 03:26:03.152]  He will just tell whoppers.
[03:26:12.654 --> 03:26:15.375]  I think he's a wonderful face for their movement.
[03:26:15.496 --> 03:26:18.397]  I can't think of, I really thought he was the gift that keeps on giving.
[03:26:18.797 --> 03:26:19.658]  Keep him out there.
[03:26:19.978 --> 03:26:28.702]  Whoever gave him $300 million, and I don't know if you saw the 60 Minutes piece, but he's there and Steve Kroft actually asked him when Gore was bragging about this $300 million he got.
[03:26:28.822 --> 03:26:31.844]  And remember, Al Gore says where you get your money dictates your motivations and your opinions.
[03:26:32.504 --> 03:26:35.146]  And if you got a bunch of money from anybody, you sold out, so on.
[03:26:35.166 --> 03:26:37.287]  So I just want to know, since he's set the rules.
[03:26:37.767 --> 03:26:41.629]  So Steve Kroft on 60 Minutes actually asked him, where'd you get it?
[03:26:42.449 --> 03:26:43.329]  And Gore freezes.
[03:26:44.230 --> 03:26:44.850]  And he freezes.
[03:26:45.410 --> 03:26:49.652]  And Krofft just waits for an answer and his wife takes Al's arm and says, Al, I'll handle this.
[03:26:50.272 --> 03:26:54.034]  Steve, we donated our Nobel Prize money and matched it.
[03:26:54.794 --> 03:27:01.057]  And Krofft accepted that and moved on without realizing that left him $298.6 million short of $300 million.
[03:27:01.637 --> 03:27:07.039]  And Gore has told us, who sees this as such a profitable investment to give you that kind of money?
[03:27:07.079 --> 03:27:08.680]  We know it's Soros and we know it's
[03:27:09.712 --> 03:27:16.734]  The guys at Kleiner Perkins, his venture capital partners who sink their money in these white elephants.
[03:27:16.754 --> 03:27:26.137]  That's right, he'll give the chicken feed $500,000 prize or a million bucks from a book, but he's keeping the blood and gore consortium.
[03:27:26.197 --> 03:27:27.337]  He's going to make the money.
[03:27:27.577 --> 03:27:30.598]  He's keeping his stock in Occidental Petroleum.
[03:27:30.858 --> 03:27:36.700]  He's keeping all the profits from the system he's setting up that he and people like
[03:27:38.342 --> 03:27:54.084]  Well, the thing is, he gets away by saying, you know, I didn't know you were against capitalism, and to believe that I'm doing this for money, you don't know me, but it's true, he could be a true believer, except
[03:27:54.713 --> 03:27:59.837]  Like I say, occasionally he speaks in such careful language that he knows what he says is untrue.
[03:27:59.877 --> 03:28:07.584]  Well, why does he have a 20-room mansion if he really believes carbon dioxide is a nerve gas that is used to, you know, kill enemy troops?
[03:28:07.644 --> 03:28:15.590]  I mean, if he really believes what plants breathe is like the most deadly VX nerve gas on earth, why does he have a building emitting so much nerve gas?
[03:28:16.391 --> 03:28:18.253]  That's actually not just positive to my mind.
[03:28:18.273 --> 03:28:19.454]  There are people like him who
[03:28:20.214 --> 03:28:20.654]  May not.
[03:28:20.914 --> 03:28:21.455]  I mean, either.
[03:28:21.515 --> 03:28:21.975]  I understand.
[03:28:22.215 --> 03:28:25.136]  Either Alex, he doesn't believe a word he says, which is possible.
[03:28:25.556 --> 03:28:28.298]  Or he believes there are different rules for different people and he's special.
[03:28:28.598 --> 03:28:29.938]  And I get the feeling he's one of those.
[03:28:29.978 --> 03:28:32.059]  But he's got four of these joints, okay?
[03:28:32.359 --> 03:28:42.664]  And he lives the way that he cannot possibly believe that buying a carbon offset credit from planting trees, which is an accounting gimmick giving you 80 years of life if the tree lives that long,
[03:28:43.662 --> 03:28:44.403]  I don't know.
[03:29:01.911 --> 03:29:03.072]  Well, what about Ted Turner?
[03:29:03.112 --> 03:29:07.574]  He has five kids, more houses than anybody else in America, I read in People Magazine.
[03:29:07.954 --> 03:29:12.757]  Literally, something like 50-something houses, 20-something jets, yachts everywhere.
[03:29:13.057 --> 03:29:15.418]  But he says, I should only be able to have one child.
[03:29:15.838 --> 03:29:17.679]  These guys know they're frauds.
[03:29:17.999 --> 03:29:20.380]  They just cold-bloodedly want our resources.
[03:29:20.661 --> 03:29:25.283]  And they know we're well-meaning and may be conned and say, OK, I guess rape me.
[03:29:25.683 --> 03:29:27.544]  Take everything I got if it's for the Earth.
[03:29:27.844 --> 03:29:28.544]  Ted Turner's right.
[03:29:28.724 --> 03:29:30.284]  That's right, you little slave.
[03:29:30.805 --> 03:29:31.885]  Give me everything you got.
[03:29:32.265 --> 03:29:32.765]  Stay there.
[03:29:32.845 --> 03:29:34.666]  Long segment coming up with Christopher Horner.
[03:29:34.906 --> 03:29:41.588]  We'll talk about the fraud he covers in his book, Red Hot Lies, how global warming alarm issues threats fraud deception to keep you misinformed.
[03:29:41.888 --> 03:29:42.648]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:42.668 --> 03:29:43.629]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:43.649 --> 03:29:47.150]  My websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:29:47.170 --> 03:29:48.790]  Stay with us.
[03:29:49.791 --> 03:29:50.591]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.031 --> 03:29:51.951]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.431 --> 03:29:53.932]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.953 --> 03:29:57.735]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.258 --> 03:30:03.860]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:30:04.280 --> 03:30:09.244]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:30:09.604 --> 03:30:11.345]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:30:11.645 --> 03:30:16.469]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:16.649 --> 03:30:17.570]  How much do you want?
[03:30:17.830 --> 03:30:18.571]  When do you want it?
[03:30:18.951 --> 03:30:20.552]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:20.833 --> 03:30:21.653]  When will you need it?
[03:30:21.913 --> 03:30:23.975]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:24.115 --> 03:30:25.216]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:25.456 --> 03:30:26.777]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:26.978 --> 03:30:32.062]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:30:32.242 --> 03:30:35.445]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:35.845 --> 03:30:39.308]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:39.648 --> 03:30:40.629]  How much will you need?
[03:30:40.869 --> 03:30:41.490]  We don't know.
[03:30:41.770 --> 03:30:42.691]  How much do you want?
[03:30:42.891 --> 03:30:43.612]  All you can get.
[03:30:43.812 --> 03:30:44.653]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:44.913 --> 03:30:47.676]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:32:00.089 --> 03:32:05.276]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:32:05.396 --> 03:32:09.782]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:32:09.922 --> 03:32:11.785]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:32:12.205 --> 03:32:13.567]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:32:13.827 --> 03:32:14.869]  There is a solution.

[03:33:09.011 --> 03:33:20.117]  If you want to find out who you're really dealing with, what the environmental movement is, especially all you useful idiots that really think you're helping the earth, you need to see my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:33:20.497 --> 03:33:27.541]  You can get this film free right now for a limited time, and you get it with Fall of the Republic, a lot of other specials that were running just up until Christmas.
[03:33:27.901 --> 03:33:29.782]  Let's say you know all about this stuff.
[03:33:29.842 --> 03:33:31.583]  Your neighbors, your friends, your family don't.
[03:33:32.193 --> 03:33:41.251]  This is a tax we have to pay voluntarily to educate our friends and family before they get turned into drone zombies of the New World Order.
[03:33:41.986 --> 03:33:47.190]  So I suggest everybody support alternative media, buy the books, buy the videos, give them to people for Christmas.
[03:33:47.210 --> 03:33:57.056]  A lot of big specials at InfoWars.com and get the amazing book, Red Hot Lies, How Global Warming Alarm Issues Threats Fraud and Deception to Keep You Misinformed by Christopher Horner.
[03:33:57.437 --> 03:34:00.178]  Available at Better Bookstores Everywhere, put out by Regnery Press.
[03:34:00.639 --> 03:34:02.160]  Also available at Amazon.com.
[03:34:02.520 --> 03:34:03.881]  Okay, Christopher, continuing.
[03:34:04.281 --> 03:34:05.202]  One segment left with you.
[03:34:05.222 --> 03:34:06.563]  I definitely want to have you back up soon.
[03:34:06.923 --> 03:34:08.344]  Very impressive discussions.
[03:34:09.409 --> 03:34:13.594]  You also talk about the harassment you've gone through with Greenpeace and other eugenicists.
[03:34:14.055 --> 03:34:18.981]  But before we go there, let's go over their lies, their scientific fraud, the premeditated fact.
[03:34:19.301 --> 03:34:22.806]  These aren't tree-hugging idiots who are just making mistakes.
[03:34:23.186 --> 03:34:24.428]  They know what they're doing.
[03:34:25.546 --> 03:34:31.247]  Yeah, look, this Climategate, well, you can tell by the effort being expended to diminish its importance.
[03:34:31.468 --> 03:34:34.408]  This is more than a thousand emails, but it's not just the emails.
[03:34:34.528 --> 03:34:37.109]  It's computer code, annotations to the code and documents.
[03:34:37.569 --> 03:34:39.930]  The point is, they're still going through to figure out what's in there.
[03:34:40.570 --> 03:34:43.130]  They were not hacked or stolen, as far as we can tell.
[03:34:43.171 --> 03:34:44.951]  They were leaked by an apparent whistleblower.
[03:34:45.559 --> 03:34:46.680]  They were not personal emails.
[03:34:46.960 --> 03:34:50.623]  All of these things the media are telling you to distract you aren't true, because this is devastating.
[03:34:50.643 --> 03:34:57.589]  What it does is it affirms in the principal's own words what I wrote in this stupid science tricks chapter of Red Hot Lies.
[03:34:57.709 --> 03:35:00.671]  I named these guys by name, and I described what they were doing.
[03:35:00.691 --> 03:35:02.653]  There are more, and there are more people involved here.
[03:35:02.673 --> 03:35:13.121]  It's a fairly broad movement, but this is at the upper echelon of the highest compensated levels of climate science, on which we spend billions every year, by the way, so you know it's settled science, right?
[03:35:13.662 --> 03:35:14.923]  And they're admitting
[03:35:15.638 --> 03:35:25.927]  What they've been doing, they've been grafting not just apples and oranges together, but in showing, uh, in reconstructing temperatures and waving it around and publishing it in the referee literature, they're grafting apples and stethoscopes.
[03:35:25.947 --> 03:35:29.550]  They're taking tree rings and they're saying, this is a proxy for climate.
[03:35:30.347 --> 03:35:33.329]  It's a pretty good proxy for precipitation, but they're using it as a thermometer.
[03:35:33.709 --> 03:35:33.989]  Okay.
[03:35:34.449 --> 03:35:37.571]  And then they put on thermometer measurements because the tree rings show a cooling.
[03:35:38.071 --> 03:35:50.338]  Well, the thermometer measurements, which, as I show in Red Hot Lies, are increasingly taken over barbecue grills in Hawkinsville, Kentucky, Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport runway, Tucson parking lot when he used to be out in the field.
[03:35:50.378 --> 03:35:58.423]  I mean, they're playing games with the data as well out of NASA, which is why we've got a notice of intent to sue them, by the way.
[03:35:59.225 --> 03:36:04.049]  And they're grafting A onto B in order to present the picture that they admit in their emails.
[03:36:04.089 --> 03:36:04.870]  They need to be true.
[03:36:05.190 --> 03:36:05.991]  They want to be true.
[03:36:06.431 --> 03:36:07.211]  Has to be true.
[03:36:07.332 --> 03:36:10.774]  Some of them say, we know it's true even though we can't see it.
[03:36:10.914 --> 03:36:17.760]  And these are the lead... This was an IPCC-UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lead author.
[03:36:18.280 --> 03:36:25.263]  This guy named Kevin Trenberth said in two of the emails, it's a travesty that he can't find the global warming that he knows is there.
[03:36:25.684 --> 03:36:32.067]  Because his heart tells him so, his computer models tell him so, but our lion eyes don't tell him so, and that's a travesty, he says.
[03:36:32.087 --> 03:36:33.327]  We need to go out and get better measurements.
[03:36:33.887 --> 03:36:43.592]  We have caught them, for example, this summer, our National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which presently is in Copenhagen right now, with a big reception room,
[03:36:44.321 --> 03:36:48.263]  With moving visuals, I read about melting glaciers and so on.
[03:36:48.283 --> 03:36:48.983]  You're paying for this.
[03:36:49.904 --> 03:37:00.168]  This summer, in order to make its claims of temperatures going up, up, up, just slowly backed out of their calculations, they dropped the satellite measurements of the ocean temperatures.
[03:37:00.628 --> 03:37:00.928]  Why?
[03:37:01.509 --> 03:37:02.529]  Well, the oceans are cooling.
[03:37:02.989 --> 03:37:04.690]  The computer models all say the oceans are warming.
[03:37:05.270 --> 03:37:06.891]  The oceans cover two-thirds of the Earth's surface.
[03:37:07.331 --> 03:37:09.913]  If you include ocean cooling, they've got a problem.
[03:37:09.953 --> 03:37:10.633]  So what did they do?
[03:37:11.113 --> 03:37:12.934]  They said, we know it's warming,
[03:37:13.610 --> 03:37:16.352]  So there must be a bias that the satellite temperatures must be wrong.
[03:37:16.713 --> 03:37:18.254]  There's something wrong with our observations.
[03:37:18.274 --> 03:37:20.356]  Who are you going to believe, my computer model or your lying eyes?
[03:37:20.796 --> 03:37:21.917]  And so on and so on and so on.
[03:37:21.937 --> 03:37:23.558]  And I detail these tricks in Red Hot Lies.
[03:37:24.059 --> 03:37:36.529]  The principals have now detailed them in their own words in these emails, computer codes, and so on, talking about tricks to hide the decline in temperature, putting in an all capitals that says, Insert Very Artificial Decline Here.
[03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:40.773]  All sorts of other claims in which they're admitting they know exactly what they're doing.
[03:37:40.793 --> 03:37:45.298]  They use the words fudge and so on, fudge factors for their data to get the desired results.
[03:37:45.719 --> 03:37:53.607]  And now the controlled corporate media is teaching us, hide the decline, fudge, that doesn't mean what you think anymore.
[03:37:53.708 --> 03:37:55.429]  That means save the polar bears.
[03:37:57.059 --> 03:37:57.119]  Yes!
[03:38:10.466 --> 03:38:21.631]  And you've also got statements like, this is just horrible!
[03:38:22.031 --> 03:38:24.012]  We can't account for the decline in temperatures!
[03:38:24.252 --> 03:38:25.053]  How do we hide it?
[03:38:25.353 --> 03:38:31.235]  I mean, it's so clear, and then they're persecuting other scientists, and working with government, colluding.
[03:38:31.456 --> 03:38:36.738]  Oh, after I explained it to the government, they're not going to release it, now that they know what type of people these are.
[03:38:37.298 --> 03:38:38.598]  And one of the heads of the U.N.
[03:38:38.618 --> 03:38:42.740]  propaganda got questioned by a filmmaker Friday in Copenhagen.
[03:38:42.780 --> 03:38:44.260]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[03:38:44.700 --> 03:38:46.061]  We'll play the video later, folks.
[03:38:46.521 --> 03:38:48.641]  And it's a press conference.
[03:38:48.902 --> 03:38:50.142]  He gets up to ask the question.
[03:38:50.682 --> 03:38:55.303]  And the guy says, oh, I don't talk about things that come from people that are this immoral.
[03:38:55.884 --> 03:38:57.344]  This comes from immoral people.
[03:38:57.684 --> 03:38:58.845]  And these are private emails.
[03:38:58.925 --> 03:38:59.945]  And he has armed
[03:39:00.880 --> 03:39:03.602]  Armed guard come in and start grabbing them and dragging them out.
[03:39:03.622 --> 03:39:05.123]  I mean, these people are authoritarian.
[03:39:05.603 --> 03:39:06.604]  Very authoritarian.
[03:39:06.984 --> 03:39:07.644]  Let me tell you something.
[03:39:08.625 --> 03:39:19.451]  I've got a chapter read, I lied, I quote these people all over the place, openly wistful about, oh, if we only had an enlightened totalitarian system like China, we could get this agenda in place.
[03:39:19.832 --> 03:39:20.132]  And that
[03:39:20.840 --> 03:39:22.161]  Argument is now out in the open.
[03:39:22.181 --> 03:39:25.183]  I believe it's Tom Friedman at the New York Times has been recently making it.
[03:39:25.723 --> 03:39:27.284]  Oh, if only we had that system.
[03:39:27.564 --> 03:39:29.045]  We need to suspend certain liberties.
[03:39:29.065 --> 03:39:39.292]  Just, just certain liberties and just for a little while because democracy, they say, is getting in the way and people who are, we have been unable to convince them to do what's in their own self-interest.
[03:39:39.592 --> 03:39:41.173]  We're going to have to make it happen somehow.
[03:39:41.433 --> 03:39:42.754]  And I quote them throughout that chapter.
[03:39:43.094 --> 03:39:44.555]  They really are getting
[03:39:45.456 --> 03:39:47.718]  Unabashed about this, because no one's calling them on it.
[03:39:47.778 --> 03:39:50.619]  Instead, as you pointed out, the media are covering for them.
[03:39:50.759 --> 03:39:56.083]  I mean, thrown in, full out, advocates, participants in the global warming industry.
[03:39:56.383 --> 03:39:57.784]  They've always been sensationalists.
[03:39:57.844 --> 03:40:01.506]  But this goes far beyond that, and I detail that in, in fact, the opening chapter.
[03:40:01.526 --> 03:40:04.748]  So, none of what's come out recently are revelations.
[03:40:04.948 --> 03:40:06.089]  They're all affirmations.
[03:40:06.670 --> 03:40:11.973]  By the way, there was not one personal email that we can find so far, yet they assigned that to everything.
[03:40:12.757 --> 03:40:18.711]  They say it all shows science as it should be, and yet it's just terrible that these things got out and so on.
[03:40:22.964 --> 03:40:28.830]  The public isn't buying the Associated Press and CNN telling us nothing to see here.
[03:40:29.231 --> 03:40:29.811]  Move along.
[03:40:29.851 --> 03:40:32.374]  I mean, do you agree that this is devastating?
[03:40:32.414 --> 03:40:41.684]  Because all the fraud and all the exposés were building, and through the grassroots the people were learning, and people were seeing Fortune 500 get behind it.
[03:40:43.425 --> 03:40:48.867]  And really, a backlash was already there, and then now you're going to tax what plants breathe?
[03:40:49.267 --> 03:40:51.228]  And Al Gore making all this money?
[03:40:51.468 --> 03:40:53.168]  I mean, is this not devastating them?
[03:40:53.748 --> 03:41:02.571]  I truly believe it is, and again, their reaction tells quite a lot, and the length to which the media are going to stop their agenda from taking water is instructive.
[03:41:04.116 --> 03:41:04.836]  What are we going to see?
[03:41:05.257 --> 03:41:09.478]  Well, the President is talking about, in fact, The Guardian has reported this.
[03:41:09.558 --> 03:41:20.142]  I wrote an article in the March issue of what's called Engage, which is the Federalist Society's publication, detailing what's called a Congressional Executive Agreement.
[03:41:20.669 --> 03:41:21.910]  Which we have plenty of.
[03:41:21.970 --> 03:41:30.776]  For example, NAFTA is a treaty that we decided wasn't a treaty, and therefore you waive the Constitution's Article 2, Section 2 requirement of two-thirds ratification.
[03:41:31.217 --> 03:41:33.338]  Two-thirds ratification will never happen for this.
[03:41:33.799 --> 03:41:46.268]  So what the President, according to the Guardian now, the Old Red herself, the Guardian, has reported that the administration is briefing European diplomats, as I've also written, to prepare them for the prospect that we must have, we need to write this in a way that
[03:41:46.940 --> 03:41:49.302]  It's gotta be plausibly declared not a treaty.
[03:41:49.742 --> 03:41:52.905]  Because then they can say all it takes is 50 plus 1 in both houses.
[03:41:53.826 --> 03:41:57.569]  And no amendment, up or down, no filibuster vote under what they call fast track.
[03:41:57.989 --> 03:42:05.615]  Now there's precedent for this in the trade context but not in a global energy rationing selective punitive wealth transfer scheme.
[03:42:05.675 --> 03:42:10.199]  And then on top of it he's saying if you don't ratify it I'm still gonna implement it.
[03:42:11.277 --> 03:42:12.819]  Yeah, we've got the EPA trying.
[03:42:13.260 --> 03:42:16.765]  Now, that doesn't satisfy the wealth transfer, and it doesn't bind us internationally.
[03:42:16.805 --> 03:42:24.617]  However, you still can possibly get buried in these enormous spending bills now, ladling more debt on my kids than theirs.
[03:42:27.325 --> 03:42:28.246]  Threatening to do this.
[03:42:28.326 --> 03:42:32.029]  Here's what I, just so you know, nobody wants to take ownership of this hot potato.
[03:42:32.329 --> 03:42:38.433]  They were furious that Bush wouldn't start this rulemaking after we lost that Supreme Court case, that he kicked it into this administration.
[03:42:38.854 --> 03:42:45.278]  Now recently EPA has declared CO2 as a quite endangered human health and environment, to which I first say, try living without it.
[03:42:45.799 --> 03:42:50.122]  But now they're going to say, we'll issue this finding and it's being published tomorrow in the Federal Register.
[03:42:50.951 --> 03:43:03.137]  And then they're going to try something unlawful, which is to say, do sort of a half-arsed maneuver with it, so that the Green Groups then march into court, and they and the courts get assigned responsibility for this.
[03:43:03.217 --> 03:43:09.660]  In other words, they won't go all the way in implementing it, but they know that the Green Groups, under the Clean Air Act, can make them.
[03:43:10.220 --> 03:43:13.442]  So, it's not really plausible deniability, but that's their route.
[03:43:13.542 --> 03:43:15.363]  Alex, they don't want to... Sure, sure.
[03:43:15.383 --> 03:43:16.123]  I mean, it's criminal.
[03:43:16.183 --> 03:43:16.883]  It's by stealth.
[03:43:17.003 --> 03:43:20.005]  It's creeping, like a spider creeping up your...
[03:43:23.136 --> 03:43:24.096]  Look at Schwarzenegger.
[03:43:24.316 --> 03:43:30.818]  He couldn't get the legislature to put a tax on TVs or ban big ones, so he just did it under the California Energy Agency.
[03:43:32.078 --> 03:43:39.020]  Look at what's happening in Washington State, where employers tax you now off how you drive, and they have to collect the money.
[03:43:39.380 --> 03:43:41.440]  I mean, they're already implementing this everywhere.
[03:43:42.561 --> 03:43:45.561]  We know under UNESCO, they're brainwashing kids in public school.
[03:43:45.901 --> 03:43:47.982]  I mean, this is a criminal cult
[03:43:48.582 --> 03:43:49.924]  Of pirates.
[03:43:49.984 --> 03:43:52.767]  How do we ever extricate ourselves from them?
[03:43:53.008 --> 03:43:54.289]  How do we ever remove them?
[03:43:54.509 --> 03:43:59.675]  Hopefully some type of criminal charges against these different scientists engaged in fraud.
[03:43:59.696 --> 03:44:03.039]  I mean, is there anything we can do to this gang of boobies?
[03:44:05.669 --> 03:44:14.211]  Well, CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute that I'm associated with, has petitioned EPA to reopen their record on the basis of the scandal that's been exposed, or I say, affirmed.
[03:44:14.691 --> 03:44:27.753]  There are people looking into what are called key-cam issues, where you essentially sue on behalf of the king and recover the king's treasure, because again, there's an intent to the fraud on the face of these emails and in the annotated computer code.
[03:44:28.494 --> 03:44:34.555]  People are looking at RICO actions against these individuals because fraud could trigger that, and so on.
[03:44:35.971 --> 03:44:37.092]  Whether I know that, I don't know.
[03:44:37.473 --> 03:44:42.357]  There are attempts to whitewash at the various universities involved right now.
[03:44:42.957 --> 03:44:46.460]  I've got a notice of intent to sue NASA by the end of the year.
[03:44:46.480 --> 03:44:48.162]  It'll be January before I get around to it.
[03:44:48.562 --> 03:44:54.988]  If they don't cough up their equivalent of this data in these emails, because I've been denied for more than two years, and I finally had enough when this thing broke.
[03:44:55.648 --> 03:44:57.750]  And so we're going to have to use the courts just like they do.
[03:44:58.070 --> 03:45:03.555]  Now, if we get involved in this treaty, it has a provision that has a three-year cooling-off period for getting out.
[03:45:04.443 --> 03:45:08.444]  Which is three years to generate all sorts of... You saw what they did to the U.S.
[03:45:08.464 --> 03:45:09.684]  under Bush.
[03:45:09.764 --> 03:45:17.086]  Three years of generating intense diplomatic and political pressure against America to stay in an energy rationing and wealth transfer scheme.
[03:45:17.126 --> 03:45:18.726]  So, you can't get into this mess.
[03:45:19.146 --> 03:45:19.986]  Now, let me tell you something.
[03:45:20.006 --> 03:45:21.446]  There's a three-legged stool they're pushing.
[03:45:21.967 --> 03:45:26.708]  It's the Kyoto Scheme, which on its face was not binding, but our courts might just implement it.
[03:45:27.148 --> 03:45:33.469]  But with the Law of the Sea Treaty, which has a tribunal, which we will have to implement their rulings here.
[03:45:33.985 --> 03:45:34.686]  I don't know.
[03:45:50.265 --> 03:45:53.426]  America is being swallowed by an unelected private offshore corporate government, the New World Order.
[03:46:20.629 --> 03:46:24.572]  Well, let's just say there are people who have us in their sight, and they see us coming.
[03:46:24.992 --> 03:46:25.613]  Let me tell you something.
[03:46:25.633 --> 03:46:35.120]  Do you think Obama politically can afford to walk away from Copenhagen without some piece of paper in hand, even though it's going to be a transfer of wealth from here to there, politically, knowing how politics works and his base in the media?
[03:46:35.560 --> 03:46:35.740]  No.
[03:46:36.160 --> 03:46:38.262]  So India and China and the rest of the world see him coming.
[03:46:38.702 --> 03:46:48.149]  They know when he goes over there on Friday, he has to give them whatever they want, because he cannot leave empty-handed from Copenhagen, in an embarrassment, twice in one year, in his first year in office.
[03:46:48.589 --> 03:46:49.550]  So they see him coming.
[03:46:50.396 --> 03:46:56.321]  We have an amateur, but an amateur with all the wrong instincts and a very dangerous agenda.
[03:46:57.463 --> 03:47:07.071]  And therefore, let me just say this, we're going to be as active as we possibly can be through the courts here, through CPI, with whatever our resources will allow.
[03:47:07.572 --> 03:47:10.995]  And I'm hoping some private entities will stand up for once and stop trying to cut a deal.
[03:47:12.733 --> 03:47:14.054]  That's another big point you made.
[03:47:14.134 --> 03:47:20.297]  All these big corporations, if they're not behind the swindling, they've said, OK, I'll join you, just don't rape me.
[03:47:20.317 --> 03:47:22.298]  And that's what the EPA said last week, as you know.
[03:47:22.618 --> 03:47:27.780]  They said, look, all you big corporations get in line or we're going to selectively enforce.
[03:47:27.840 --> 03:47:32.202]  I mean, they're literally like a mobster beating up the little grocery store owner.
[03:47:32.462 --> 03:47:36.404]  When are we going to grow a backbone to these parasites and say no?
[03:47:37.142 --> 03:47:38.643]  It's even worse than window insurance.
[03:47:38.663 --> 03:47:43.187]  What they were saying was, tapping the cage and saying, you better pay me to protect you from my lunatic friend here.
[03:47:43.507 --> 03:47:44.928]  Be ashamed that this thing got out of the cage.
[03:47:45.248 --> 03:47:48.831]  But the problem is, they also said it that day later, we plan on doing both.
[03:47:49.271 --> 03:47:53.094]  No matter what you pass in Congress, we plan on trying to do what we can to undo the Clean Air Act anyway.
[03:47:53.394 --> 03:47:56.076]  Let me tell you about a provision in these two cap-and-trade bills real quickly.
[03:47:56.376 --> 03:47:58.518]  They're 500 pages different in size, okay?
[03:47:58.718 --> 03:47:59.599]  They're not the same bill.
[03:47:59.859 --> 03:48:02.721]  But they have one provision that was identically drafted and buried in both.
[03:48:03.181 --> 03:48:05.163]  And the Senate bill is called Section 707.
[03:48:05.483 --> 03:48:06.124]  And what it says is,
[03:48:06.804 --> 03:48:17.328]  Every law, every law in the United States Code shall, not may, shall be implemented by the President as a CO2 suppression law, a carbon dioxide suppression global warming law.
[03:48:17.368 --> 03:48:18.728]  It's a carbon dictatorship!
[03:48:19.028 --> 03:48:24.130]  That's the Department of Agriculture and Interior permitting, that's the tax code, that's the Endangered Species Act, it's everything.
[03:48:24.530 --> 03:48:30.993]  There's no certainty for sale and these suckers in business who keep saying, well I just need certainty, I need to buy peace, I'm gonna super peace.
[03:48:31.333 --> 03:48:34.934]  Good luck buddy, you are selling us all out thinking you're getting yourself a deal and you are not.
[03:48:36.368 --> 03:48:38.790]  Yeah, there's no making a deal with these vampires.
[03:48:38.830 --> 03:48:43.253]  I mean, this is a greedy... I mean, folks, I'm not trying to demonize them.
[03:48:43.293 --> 03:48:43.853]  I've studied them.
[03:48:44.134 --> 03:48:46.755]  These are really hellish, horrible control freaks.
[03:48:46.775 --> 03:48:50.298]  I mean, at the end of the day, they aren't gonna stop, are they?
[03:48:52.260 --> 03:48:53.200]  They're putting in these bills.
[03:48:53.460 --> 03:48:56.101]  They want full and total control in the name of global warming.
[03:48:56.121 --> 03:48:57.602]  But hey, Alex, we're saving the planet.
[03:48:57.642 --> 03:48:58.322]  What about the children?
[03:48:58.562 --> 03:49:00.583]  You wouldn't want to kill children, would you?
[03:49:00.603 --> 03:49:02.303]  I mean, they've practiced their routine.
[03:49:02.683 --> 03:49:04.584]  The problem is certainty is not for sale.
[03:49:04.624 --> 03:49:05.924]  And I've got all these businesses.
[03:49:05.964 --> 03:49:09.525]  I've had at least two CEOs say to me, well, Chris, I just need certainty.
[03:49:10.046 --> 03:49:10.866]  And they don't get it.
[03:49:11.346 --> 03:49:11.906]  Read the bill.
[03:49:12.026 --> 03:49:14.287]  I know it's 1,300 pages long, but somebody has to.
[03:49:14.627 --> 03:49:15.107]  Read the bill.
[03:49:15.187 --> 03:49:16.187]  Certainty is not for sale.
[03:49:16.588 --> 03:49:18.228]  You cannot sue for peace with these people.
[03:49:18.608 --> 03:49:20.829]  The day it goes into effect, you know what they want.
[03:49:21.613 --> 03:49:21.853]  More.
[03:49:22.314 --> 03:49:23.735]  And let me leave you with this.
[03:49:24.075 --> 03:49:32.702]  Did you know that nothing ever proposed Cap-and-Trade legislation, Kyoto, would, according to anybody, under any scenario or set of assumptions, detectively impact the climate?
[03:49:33.363 --> 03:49:37.707]  So it is not reasonable to conclude it's about the climate.
[03:49:38.187 --> 03:49:40.729]  It's only reasonable to conclude it's about what it would do.
[03:49:40.989 --> 03:49:42.010]  And you know what it would do.
[03:49:42.611 --> 03:49:43.812]  But it's not about what it wouldn't do.
[03:49:43.912 --> 03:49:45.193]  That's just not logical.
[03:49:46.875 --> 03:49:47.516]  Unbelievable.
[03:49:47.556 --> 03:49:52.218]  We've got to have you back up just to break down the legislation quickly in the last minute we've got.
[03:49:52.659 --> 03:49:59.843]  Do you think that they're going to be able to ram through the cap-and-trade, I mean not the treaty, but the cap-and-trade bill that's passed the House?
[03:50:00.264 --> 03:50:02.425]  They're trying to shake people down as you described with EPA.
[03:50:02.445 --> 03:50:03.526]  I don't think folks are buying it.
[03:50:03.626 --> 03:50:10.090]  I think there's a chance we'll get a one-line, the EPA Clean Air Act as written shall not be implemented this way, but the Dems will fight that tooth and nail.
[03:50:10.670 --> 03:50:15.954]  The long answer is to add that to no, but it will not be without a struggle in the spring.
[03:50:16.214 --> 03:50:22.778]  They're going to try to slip it in because you don't pass the biggest tax increase in American history late in an even number, meaning election year.
[03:50:24.139 --> 03:50:24.880]  And they just don't?
[03:50:25.524 --> 03:50:27.646]  They just don't care how unpopular they are.
[03:50:27.986 --> 03:50:30.908]  There is that sense of urgency that they're rushing everything through.
[03:50:31.168 --> 03:50:36.752]  If we can hold them another two years, will their global carbon dictatorship be derailed permanently?
[03:50:37.272 --> 03:50:41.775]  I think so, because you can't tell people the sky constantly is falling when the beaches in the sky are just where we left them.
[03:50:42.836 --> 03:50:43.276]  Amazing.
[03:50:43.316 --> 03:50:44.657]  He's the author of Red Hot Lies.
[03:50:45.695 --> 03:50:48.059]  Global warming alarm issues, threats, fraud, deception.
[03:50:48.379 --> 03:50:49.320]  Keep you misinformed.
[03:50:49.741 --> 03:50:55.969]  He's Christopher Horner and a CEI, Competitive Enterprise Institute is the organization.
[03:50:56.009 --> 03:50:57.812]  I look forward to talking to you again in the future.
[03:50:58.112 --> 03:50:58.833]  Very impressive.
[03:51:01.331 --> 03:51:05.333]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[03:51:05.614 --> 03:51:08.475]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[03:51:08.895 --> 03:51:16.680]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[03:51:16.940 --> 03:51:18.862]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[03:51:19.182 --> 03:51:21.123]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[03:51:21.564 --> 03:51:28.009]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[03:51:28.369 --> 03:51:34.154]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[03:51:34.574 --> 03:51:35.435]  Please stand with Utopia Silver.
[03:51:35.435 --> 03:51:35.955]  I think so.
[03:52:01.841 --> 03:52:05.487]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:05.848 --> 03:52:08.873]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:09.113 --> 03:52:10.516]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:52:11.221 --> 03:52:13.882]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:13.902 --> 03:52:20.123]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:20.283 --> 03:52:25.304]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:25.464 --> 03:52:35.466]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:35.586 --> 03:52:37.687]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:37.927 --> 03:52:39.247]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:39.507 --> 03:52:41.788]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:41.968 --> 03:52:43.808]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:44.108 --> 03:52:48.890]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:49.250 --> 03:52:54.011]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:52:54.251 --> 03:52:58.373]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:53:06.384 --> 03:53:06.785]  Okay, yeah.
[03:53:07.125 --> 03:53:07.606]  Stop that!
[03:53:08.046 --> 03:53:09.327]  Ugh!
[03:53:09.347 --> 03:53:09.988]  You're killing me!
[03:53:10.969 --> 03:53:13.751]  Okay, they want me to dress up like Santa.
[03:53:14.212 --> 03:53:14.752]  My thoughts?
[03:53:15.253 --> 03:53:16.574]  What's this gonna prove?
[03:53:16.834 --> 03:53:19.116]  They want to remind you about the holiday special.
[03:53:19.597 --> 03:53:20.538]  So here it is.
[03:53:21.118 --> 03:53:26.143]  Buy a month's supply of Life Change Tea and get two extra weeks free!

[03:53:29.446 --> 03:53:30.147]  Oh my goodness.
[03:53:30.327 --> 03:53:33.089]  Lose weight and don't become the size of Santa.
[03:53:33.390 --> 03:53:34.310]  Oh, who wrote this?
[03:53:34.571 --> 03:53:36.873]  Buy one month, get two weeks free.
[03:53:36.933 --> 03:53:38.334]  That's the best sale of the year.
[03:53:38.514 --> 03:53:40.656]  So go to GetTheTea.com.
[03:53:40.696 --> 03:53:43.158]  That's GetTheTea.com.

[03:53:48.222 --> 03:53:51.305]  Come on, new people!
[03:53:51.325 --> 03:53:52.165]  928-308-0408.
[03:53:52.886 --> 03:53:55.788]  And all of you that have ordered the tea, thank you for this year.
[03:53:55.889 --> 03:53:57.029]  We love you guys!
[03:53:57.370 --> 03:53:57.870]  Yeah, we know.
[03:53:58.050 --> 03:53:58.591]  You love us too.
[03:54:05.596 --> 03:54:08.637]  I really should have introduced Christopher Horner better.
[03:54:13.019 --> 03:54:17.161]  Horner has represented CEI as well as scientists and members of the U.S.
[03:54:17.181 --> 03:54:21.603]  House and Senate on matters of environmental policy in the federal courts, including the Supreme Court.
[03:54:24.159 --> 03:54:25.520]  And he writes for the U.S.
[03:54:25.580 --> 03:54:26.781]  Law Review, you name it.
[03:54:26.801 --> 03:54:28.542]  He really is a top lawyer on all this.
[03:54:28.942 --> 03:54:33.665]  He was telling me off-air how the environmentalists attack his house and break into his stuff.
[03:54:34.325 --> 03:54:35.686]  This is a devil cult, man.
[03:54:35.706 --> 03:54:36.667]  They mean business.
[03:54:36.907 --> 03:54:38.988]  They want your property and they want it now.
[03:54:39.969 --> 03:54:42.370]  And they are a bunch of eugenicist killers.
[03:54:45.672 --> 03:54:49.114]  And they never care about anything real on the environmental front.
[03:54:49.375 --> 03:54:51.436]  They want your property.
[03:54:52.156 --> 03:54:54.457]  George Soros is a vicious cutthroat.
[03:54:54.957 --> 03:54:56.198]  So are the Rockefellers.
[03:54:59.019 --> 03:55:02.721]  She started telling me about Rockefeller and about Shell.
[03:55:03.601 --> 03:55:10.024]  And then we were going, we were coming out of break and we were going, and I said, okay, we can talk about that.
[03:55:10.044 --> 03:55:11.225]  And he goes, yeah, you can talk about it.
[03:55:11.645 --> 03:55:13.506]  And then I heard him as I went live.
[03:55:15.405 --> 03:55:17.706]  I mean, who do you think runs the whole show?
[03:55:37.100 --> 03:55:38.161]  They're criminals.
[03:55:38.261 --> 03:55:39.302]  They're frauds.
[03:55:39.702 --> 03:55:40.623]  They're scammers.
[03:55:40.803 --> 03:55:41.984]  They know it's a scam.
[03:55:42.244 --> 03:55:44.406]  They don't care about the environment.
[03:55:44.747 --> 03:55:46.388]  Don't you understand that?
[03:55:46.868 --> 03:55:48.310]  These are cold-blooded people.
[03:55:48.570 --> 03:55:49.891]  You heard him listing the quotes?
[03:55:50.511 --> 03:55:53.694]  Every one of these people I ever read about is, oh, China's so great.
[03:55:53.754 --> 03:55:54.755]  Oh, we run China.
[03:55:55.035 --> 03:55:56.376]  They're running the global system.
[03:55:56.737 --> 03:55:58.358]  Oh, they kill the forced abortions.
[03:55:58.458 --> 03:55:59.339]  Oh, they kill the babies.
[03:55:59.799 --> 03:56:00.941]  Oh my God, we need that here.
[03:56:01.001 --> 03:56:02.663]  Oh, it's going to be so wonderful when we have it.
[03:56:03.143 --> 03:56:06.567]  I mean, they're all over the news this week calling for a global one-child policy.
[03:56:07.028 --> 03:56:09.210]  These people hate freedom.
[03:56:10.131 --> 03:56:11.072]  They're dangerous.
[03:56:14.256 --> 03:56:16.699]  You don't have to buy the DVD, Endgame.
[03:56:16.959 --> 03:56:19.362]  You don't have to buy the DVD, Fall of the Republic.
[03:56:21.408 --> 03:56:30.915]  But what you do have to do is go to YouTube and get the links to the films and send them to everybody you know every day and show co-workers.
[03:56:31.836 --> 03:56:38.761]  The people don't appreciate, oh, here's a $200,000 film for free in one piece on YouTube on a director channel.
[03:56:39.382 --> 03:56:40.082]  Eh, so what?
[03:56:40.122 --> 03:56:41.163]  I don't want to watch that video.
[03:56:41.463 --> 03:56:48.889]  They'll tend to watch a DVD and the fancy packaging with the nice extras and everything else.
[03:56:50.524 --> 03:56:53.666]  And yes, your purchase also makes this radio show possible.
[03:56:53.926 --> 03:56:57.207]  But we don't have time to screw around.
[03:56:57.888 --> 03:57:01.329]  Both these films expose the fake environmental agenda like no other.
[03:57:02.210 --> 03:57:10.494]  Both these videos follow the Republic, shows you how the big banks run the environmental scam, how they're bankrupting us, how they're bringing us into world government.
[03:57:10.774 --> 03:57:12.535]  People are finally ready to see the truth.
[03:57:12.875 --> 03:57:15.757]  This film gets into what they want to do once they got control.
[03:57:16.577 --> 03:57:19.799]  All the stuff they've done so far, murdering little children,
[03:57:20.675 --> 03:57:23.497]  Just so they could test scientists to see, will U.S.
[03:57:23.557 --> 03:57:26.379]  scientists radiate 4,300 children to death?
[03:57:26.659 --> 03:57:27.780]  The answer is yes!
[03:57:28.560 --> 03:57:29.261]  Yes, sir!
[03:57:29.321 --> 03:57:30.482]  May we have some more to kill!
[03:57:30.502 --> 03:57:37.186]  I mean, you know, you've got to get your mind around the level of bloodthirsty control freaks!
[03:57:37.666 --> 03:57:44.171]  These people, you like drinking a cold bottle of ice cold Coca-Cola, might not be good for you, but you pop the top and guzzle it down.
[03:57:44.907 --> 03:57:48.489]  No, these guys like putting a little kid in a radiation chamber and murdering them.
[03:57:48.969 --> 03:57:52.972]  And watching them bleed out their gums and flop around in pain for five days.
[03:57:53.332 --> 03:57:53.752]  Okay?
[03:57:53.932 --> 03:57:54.993]  That's who we're dealing with!
[03:57:55.133 --> 03:57:56.654]  They want to kill you and your family!
[03:57:57.674 --> 03:58:01.216]  What does it take for me to get this through to your brains, ladies and gentlemen?
[03:58:01.396 --> 03:58:04.098]  You're gonna have to get primitive and fired up and angry.
[03:58:05.273 --> 03:58:10.317]  You gotta use your intellectual understanding of the threat, but then, how do you open up a can of whoop-butt?
[03:58:10.657 --> 03:58:11.718]  You get fired up.
[03:58:12.278 --> 03:58:12.859]  I'm telling you.
[03:58:13.299 --> 03:58:14.120]  The InfoWars.
[03:58:14.160 --> 03:58:15.701]  These people are ready to be brought down.
[03:58:15.921 --> 03:58:16.982]  They're ready to be defeated.
[03:58:17.222 --> 03:58:18.984]  If we can admit how evil they are.
[03:58:19.264 --> 03:58:22.887]  The mind trick is, though, it's hard for people to believe this level of evil.

[03:58:34.467 --> 03:58:41.114]  Final hour straight ahead.
[03:58:41.154 --> 03:58:46.139]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:58:46.760 --> 03:58:50.043]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[03:58:50.764 --> 03:58:54.988]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:55.308 --> 03:58:55.909]  Number one.
[03:58:56.209 --> 03:59:00.211]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.492 --> 03:59:05.054]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:05.394 --> 03:59:05.835]  It's true.
[03:59:06.135 --> 03:59:10.677]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.818 --> 03:59:15.100]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:15.401 --> 03:59:19.143]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:20.124 --> 03:59:22.486]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:59:22.886 --> 03:59:26.269]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:31.272]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:59:31.492 --> 03:59:36.256]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
