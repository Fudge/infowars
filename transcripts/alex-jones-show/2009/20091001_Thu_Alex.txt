[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:02.531]  He presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:02.892 --> 00:00:05.234]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:10.119]  We are back live.
[00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.502]  It's the Alex Jones Show streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:19.448]  Again, USA Today and the Boston Herald as well as the Associated Press have picked up on the story.
[00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:24.352]  We now go live to Alex Jones on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[00:00:24.492 --> 00:00:24.672]  Alex?
[00:00:25.663 --> 00:00:33.388]  Okay, we just got a tour from Becky Shea, the former Billings Gazette reporter that's now the PR spokesperson for this facility, Brigham Police Force.
[00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.612]  She admitted that it'll be a foreign paramilitary mercenary training facility.
[00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:41.694]  She admitted that it's going to be a detention facility.
[00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:46.317]  I saw some other things inside that I'll talk about in the last hour today.
[00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:49.339]  Once I'm out of here, I'll just leave it at that, to say the least.
[00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:53.968]  The point is, is this is just off the charts.
[00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:56.172]  They're now doing massive damage control.
[00:00:56.192 --> 00:00:58.716]  They're about to give us a tour of the outside of the facility.
[00:00:58.756 --> 00:01:02.482]  I just got a tour of only one wing of this gigantic
[00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:04.656]  27 million dollar facility.
[00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:06.398]  They would not let us into most of the areas.
[00:01:06.878 --> 00:01:09.221]  Just while I was in some of the offices, I saw blueprints.
[00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:09.942]  I saw documents.
[00:01:09.982 --> 00:01:10.963]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:13.225]  But this story is definitely the motherlode.
[00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:17.850]  This is definitely a black site slash ghost site in the United States.
[00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:20.994]  They plan to have this be a ghost site, but locals blew the whistle.
[00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:23.297]  They were definitely going to try to become the police.
[00:01:24.037 --> 00:01:24.917]  I think so.
[00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.175]  We're good to go.
[00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:04.544]  And we're going to get in the car with her and get a tour.
[00:02:04.644 --> 00:02:06.726]  She is very nice.
[00:02:06.847 --> 00:02:15.635]  She just got hired as the PR person, and I think it's pretty freaked out right now that all of this is happening because of their, you know, just incredible secrecy.
[00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:19.418]  We've had three different carloads now, a fourth and fifth pulling up of listeners.
[00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:21.661]  People are giving us thumbs up around town.
[00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:22.802]  We have a huge listenership here.
[00:02:23.402 --> 00:02:24.984]  So this is just amazing.
[00:02:25.024 --> 00:02:26.826]  But again, Becky has been
[00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.608]  Becky has been extremely, extremely helpful.
[00:02:30.648 --> 00:02:31.748]  She's talking to some of the other folks.
[00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:32.689]  Hey folks, you listeners?
[00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:33.489]  Hey!
[00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.050]  Hey, nice to meet you.
[00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.570]  What's your name?
[00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.511]  Mike Keller.
[00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:37.511]  Mike, nice to meet you.
[00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:38.192]  Ma'am, what's your name?
[00:02:38.352 --> 00:02:39.072]  Tony Byer.
[00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:40.233]  Hey, Tony, nice to meet you.
[00:02:40.253 --> 00:02:41.853]  Boy, more and more listeners are arriving here.
[00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:44.355]  Had a lot of locals driving by giving us thumbs up.
[00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:49.337]  Becky has been extremely helpful, not shadowy like the other folks that have been running the facility.
[00:02:49.397 --> 00:02:51.158]  She took over as PR last Friday.
[00:02:51.478 --> 00:02:53.759]  She admitted that it was only disclosed to her then and he's a 14-time felon.
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.882]  Uh, but again, this is one of the most dangerous missions we've ever been on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:58.902 --> 00:03:01.904]  This is definitely a black site, a ghost site we were planning to go live with.
[00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:05.106]  I have seen incontrovertible proof while inside the facility.
[00:03:05.827 --> 00:03:09.729]  And as you were saying, USA Today, AP, others are picking this up.
[00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:10.209]  Here's the deal.
[00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:17.294]  I want you to go to Steve Quayle, bring him up, and then we're going to leave this phone live as all these listeners are arriving.
[00:03:17.354 --> 00:03:22.257]  As we get through them in her car and get a live tour, then Karen will be fading live
[00:03:22.941 --> 00:03:23.542]  We're good to go.
[00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:42.462]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:43.323]  Are we still going to get that tour?
[00:03:43.343 --> 00:03:45.024]  Okay, we're going to come right back, guys.
[00:03:45.105 --> 00:03:46.846]  Or they can follow along if they want.
[00:03:46.886 --> 00:03:48.068]  We're going to get this tour on Saturday.
[00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:49.489]  Oh, you've already done the tour.
[00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.970]  You've done the tour.
[00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.452]  Okay, we've got a lot of media here.
[00:03:52.472 --> 00:03:53.853]  There was CBS News here earlier.
[00:03:53.873 --> 00:03:55.935]  Yes, I'm going to be back in 10 minutes.
[00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:57.157]  How long will this tour take?
[00:03:57.177 --> 00:03:57.617]  10 minutes?
[00:03:58.138 --> 00:03:59.099]  Yeah, we're going to be back in 10.
[00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.481]  Okay, Burmese is not all that you need.
[00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:03.470]  Yes, absolutely Alex.
[00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:12.935]  I'd just like to also point out that one of our listeners did call in and contact Blackwater from Canada where he asked if there were any operations going on with Blackwater in Canada.
[00:04:12.975 --> 00:04:16.857]  He said no, but we are beginning operations in Montana.
[00:04:16.897 --> 00:04:18.198]  Yet more confirmation.
[00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:22.248]  We're going to take the pier.
[00:04:22.268 --> 00:04:26.293]  We're going to go around the back of the facility and I'm going to sign up for some landmarks, Jim.
[00:04:26.313 --> 00:04:27.515]  Okay, thank you.
[00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:27.996]  Let's go in.
[00:04:28.156 --> 00:04:28.657]  Let's go in.
[00:04:29.217 --> 00:04:31.020]  Thanks for letting me visit with you today.
[00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:32.181]  It's very nice.
[00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:34.024]  Let's go ahead and bring Steve up right now.
[00:04:34.044 --> 00:04:35.726]  Steve, give us your take on the situation.
[00:04:36.307 --> 00:04:37.829]  Well, the situation, Alex, is as the
[00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:48.823]  The press has broken on the past background of Hilton and obviously Paul Watson writing on the tie-in with Blackwater.
[00:04:49.303 --> 00:04:58.295]  I just got off the phone with someone up in the Flathead Valley who's talking, now this is all relevant to what you're doing down there, the presence of Blackwater training foreign
[00:04:58.895 --> 00:04:59.836]  We're good to go.
[00:05:15.473 --> 00:05:22.958]  That I sent down there was down there yesterday, but obviously the situation that I think everyone's got to understand is you follow the money trail.
[00:05:23.078 --> 00:05:32.485]  It is my contention that we're seeing front men who are put out there that are willing to take the heat to hide the real ownership and the real purpose.
[00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:37.988]  You need to ask Becky what the 10,000 to 16,000 acres is going to be used for.
[00:05:38.008 --> 00:05:44.493]  She told us, Steve, she said that they are getting additional acres for an international paramilitary training facility.
[00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:59.567]  Well, again, ask her then who the international paramilitary is going to be trained for, because Alex, as you and I are on the radio right now, I'm getting people that are listening in to us saying that they're observing, and you blew into Billings.
[00:05:59.787 --> 00:06:00.687]  Did you fly into Billings?
[00:06:01.248 --> 00:06:07.731]  Yes, we've had locals tell us and call her to the show that they've seen black Convys, black Hawk helicopters, men training in the hills.
[00:06:10.174 --> 00:06:25.821]  And in the area that you are at, the thing that I think is really important for all the listeners is to realize that reservations have different rules and regulations, which allows a lot of foreign corporations and foreign military... Yes, it's just like Guantanamo.
[00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:27.562]  That's why they moved it there, because it's a no-man's land.
[00:06:27.602 --> 00:06:31.044]  Steve, I'm here getting a tour from Becky right now.
[00:06:31.064 --> 00:06:33.125]  I want to keep you for... I know we said we'd only have you for 20 minutes.
[00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:33.825]  You're very busy.
[00:06:34.205 --> 00:06:35.866]  I'm going to be leaving in about 10 minutes.
[00:06:35.886 --> 00:06:39.348]  Can you give us a full report at the bottom of the hour since we're getting the tour right now?
[00:06:39.808 --> 00:06:49.999]  Sure, and Alex, are you, are you going to, uh, possibly, uh, uh, where you, well, call me off air, because I would like to get... Yes, I meant to call you this morning, but things started moving so fast.
[00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:55.545]  We are in, we are in one of the police, uh, vehicles that had the Hardin police... You're in my company.
[00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:58.688]  Yes, yes, yes, we're in the company car that did have the decals on it saying Hardin, correct?
[00:06:59.778 --> 00:07:01.079]  That is absolutely correct.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.840]  Yes, yes.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.325]  I am in one of the black Mercedes Benz SUVs inside the detention center right now.
[00:07:08.405 --> 00:07:12.989]  So, Steve, we're going to take you down in just a few minutes and come right back to you because we really want your analysis.
[00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:17.693]  Becky is going to be using the phone as a microphone so she can give us a live report.
[00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:18.754]  Becky, where are we right now?
[00:07:19.554 --> 00:07:24.798]  We are on the eastern side of Two Rivers Detention Facility.
[00:07:24.858 --> 00:07:26.580]  This is land that is owned by
[00:07:27.358 --> 00:07:33.202]  The Port Authority here, the City of Hardin, the facility and the land are owned by the City of Hardin.
[00:07:33.762 --> 00:07:44.829]  And I'm going to point out the boundaries of our land, where the boundaries are to our good neighbors the Crow Indian Nation, and where we intend to do some construction on this property.
[00:07:45.808 --> 00:07:51.990]  Okay, and this facility is, now we're here in this big field on the back end of the confettino wire.
[00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.571]  We're here, is this where they're planning to build the International Military Training Facility?
[00:07:57.271 --> 00:08:05.093]  No sir, and I want to make clear to, hopefully I'm live, I want to make clear to everyone that the training facility is also for, you know, domestic.
[00:08:05.133 --> 00:08:12.055]  So you listeners out there, if you've got a police department, hometown group that needs some good quality training, we're going to be available to offer it to them too.
[00:08:12.655 --> 00:08:15.337]  Sure, and what about Blackwater Connections?
[00:08:15.357 --> 00:08:19.480]  We've been hearing a lot about that and the company in several places has bragged that they have Blackwater Connections.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.043]  I've heard so many names that it's just absolutely phenomenal to me.
[00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:31.087]  We're not disclosing the name of our parent company, and that's it.
[00:08:31.147 --> 00:08:33.329]  We're not disclosing the name of our parent company.
[00:08:34.051 --> 00:08:34.952]  We stand alone.
[00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:36.192]  Oh, there's a parent company?
[00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:38.914]  There is a parent company of American Police Force.
[00:08:38.974 --> 00:08:40.274]  There is an umbrella company.
[00:08:40.435 --> 00:08:43.256]  American Police Force stands alone as a corporation.
[00:08:43.276 --> 00:08:47.618]  And we are American Police Force.
[00:08:47.658 --> 00:08:48.279]  We are who we are.
[00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:59.325]  But if it's a secretive group, owned by a secret group, and it's headed by a 14-time felon, and then they were putting police decals on their vehicles the first few days, I mean, don't people have a right to be a little bit concerned about this, Becky?
[00:08:59.885 --> 00:09:03.387]  I think people have a right to whatever feeling they want, and I hope that
[00:09:03.951 --> 00:09:05.873]  Alex, I've entrusted you and your crew.
[00:09:05.933 --> 00:09:07.475]  We've talked for what, now an hour?
[00:09:07.495 --> 00:09:08.196]  You were very nice.
[00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:09.457]  I think you were very nice, General.
[00:09:09.617 --> 00:09:12.140]  But General, but, you know... No, let me finish.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.782]  I think we've talked for about an hour.
[00:09:13.822 --> 00:09:22.391]  You've got the context, and I'm trusting you to explain to your audiences that, you know, this is my company car, and I'm...
[00:09:23.727 --> 00:09:26.549]  And just share with them all the information I've shared with you.
[00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:33.813]  But, Becky, there are newscasts where the locals and the people at American Police Force were saying they wanted this to be Guantanamo Bay West.
[00:09:33.853 --> 00:09:34.753]  That was on CNN.
[00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:39.776]  That was not American Police Force, and I'd ask you to go back and recheck your sources.
[00:09:39.816 --> 00:09:40.456]  That was too risky.
[00:09:40.476 --> 00:09:43.638]  So they've not been requesting to have this as a facility to hold detainees?
[00:09:43.678 --> 00:09:44.519]  No, sir.
[00:09:44.739 --> 00:09:46.580]  And please, everyone, listen carefully.
[00:09:47.102 --> 00:09:53.145]  Two Rivers Detention Facility will not hold Guantanamo BA nor other multinational offenders.
[00:09:53.246 --> 00:09:59.089]  We're a minimum and medium security... Why don't I see documents on the wall blueprints saying foreign alien detention facility?
[00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.814]  That's the former leasee who is here.
[00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:05.415]  You also saw documents on the wall that said civigenic surplus.
[00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:13.897]  When CEC pulled out of this facility, they left everything from letterheads to two-year-old packages of mustard in my desk, Alex.
[00:10:13.977 --> 00:10:16.658]  Those people walked... Okay, we're going to skip this break, okay?
[00:10:16.718 --> 00:10:17.098]  Is that clear?
[00:10:17.118 --> 00:10:18.059]  We have time to skip the break?
[00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:19.459]  Genesis?
[00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:21.293]  Correct?
[00:10:21.834 --> 00:10:22.054]  Yes, sir.
[00:10:22.074 --> 00:10:22.554]  Are we live?
[00:10:22.934 --> 00:10:23.154]  Yes.
[00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:25.375]  Okay, we're skipping this break right now.
[00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:36.502]  Steve Quayle, we're going to go back to Becky here in just a moment, but I'm going to hand the phone to her, Steve, for any questions you've got for Becky, the spokesperson for America Police Force here in Arden at the detention facility.
[00:10:36.542 --> 00:10:38.283]  We are on the property right now.
[00:10:38.603 --> 00:10:39.143]  Here is Becky.
[00:10:39.163 --> 00:10:40.384]  You wanted to talk to Steve Quayle, Becky.
[00:10:40.404 --> 00:10:41.465]  Here you are, live on the radio.
[00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:47.488]  Unfortunately, Steven Quayle has dropped... Oh, Steve Quayle dropped on us.
[00:10:48.334 --> 00:10:53.698]  Would one of you gentlemen get out and tell the fine-hearted citizens behind me that we're going to talk to them?
[00:10:53.718 --> 00:10:55.700]  We're going to get out of the car and talk to them real soon?
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.542]  I don't care which one of you does it, but... I thought Steve was going to hold.
[00:10:58.842 --> 00:10:59.963]  We'll call him back in ten minutes.
[00:10:59.983 --> 00:11:00.764]  You know what, Becky?
[00:11:01.044 --> 00:11:03.186]  I want you to be able to make whatever statement you want then.
[00:11:04.347 --> 00:11:05.187]  As you give us a turn.
[00:11:05.227 --> 00:11:05.828]  You've got the phone.
[00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:06.488]  Alright.
[00:11:06.508 --> 00:11:06.949]  You're live.
[00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:13.013]  I apologize, because I'm going to get out in the lovely eastern Montana wind, and so you might hear some of that in the background.
[00:11:14.054 --> 00:11:26.747]  Q River's Detention Facility was built and is owned by Q River's Authority, which is the Port Authority that was created under Montana law as the Economic Development Wing of the City of Hardin.
[00:11:28.168 --> 00:11:36.236]  This facility is built for, is accredited for, and has the authority for, and will only hold
[00:11:37.006 --> 00:11:43.489]  Minimum and medium security offenders, and those, under the authorities, are how we're allowed to operate.
[00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:49.032]  Those offenders can only come from local, state, and federal jurisdictions.
[00:11:49.672 --> 00:11:55.996]  So that might be another county in Montana, that might be the state you're listening, that you're sitting in right now.
[00:11:56.316 --> 00:12:00.958]  If they need to make that connection, then we can make that connection.
[00:12:03.328 --> 00:12:10.618]  Right now, we're trying to open a 100,000 square foot detention facility that's been shuttered for two years.
[00:12:11.199 --> 00:12:17.247]  Now, when we kind of cut out there, Alex was saying to me he saw some documents in the building.
[00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:19.510]  My explanation for that was
[00:12:20.211 --> 00:12:25.638]  The former contractee that was going to operate this facility had some plans.
[00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:29.282]  When they walked away from Hardin, they dropped everything and they walked away.
[00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:38.773]  They left everything from mustard packets and plastic spoons and crumbs and desk drawers to the document that Alex was referring to, to letterhead.
[00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:42.024]  So right now, as we come in, we're doing a couple things.
[00:12:42.064 --> 00:12:50.126]  We're cleaning this place head to toe, and we're making sure that it's ready for whoever comes in and contracts to hold offenders here.
[00:12:50.146 --> 00:12:53.707]  And I want to make it clear that that's always going to be local control.
[00:12:53.847 --> 00:12:59.869]  It's always going to be the people of Hardin who have the final say on what offenders are held here.
[00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.989]  And Alex?
[00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:26.467]  Alex, I just want to point out that our intel is pointing to the parent company being called DPS.
[00:13:26.527 --> 00:13:29.108]  That's a story we're developing right now at the moment.
[00:13:29.128 --> 00:13:29.588]  DPS?
[00:13:30.068 --> 00:13:30.668]  DPS.
[00:13:31.029 --> 00:13:31.569]  DPS.
[00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:32.869]  DPS.
[00:13:33.309 --> 00:13:34.290]  DPS, sir.
[00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.951]  Okay, it's very hard to hear you in this wind.
[00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:37.671]  Say it slowly.
[00:13:38.091 --> 00:13:39.131]  DPS.
[00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:41.092]  And there are links on the forum.
[00:13:41.132 --> 00:13:42.633]  Is that P as in donkey?
[00:13:43.033 --> 00:13:43.673]  Yes, yes.
[00:13:43.853 --> 00:13:44.973]  DPS, sir.
[00:13:45.293 --> 00:13:48.695]  So it's like the Department of Public Safety in Texas, DPS?
[00:13:48.755 --> 00:13:49.615]  Yes, yes.
[00:13:53.742 --> 00:13:55.404]  I believe so, Jaren's saying yes.
[00:14:13.197 --> 00:14:16.141]  Okay, well, I wanted to have him stay on hold so he could comment.
[00:14:16.501 --> 00:14:18.684]  But I just want to point out, he was right about this last week.
[00:14:18.704 --> 00:14:20.226]  He was the one saying that it was a felon.
[00:14:20.646 --> 00:14:22.449]  Even before that was anywhere, he was the one.
[00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:29.457]  And that's the thing about Steve, you know, sometimes it sounds wild, but in my case, it just always turns out to be true when it's political.
[00:14:31.835 --> 00:14:32.896]  This is wild, Burma!
[00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:50.167]  And let me say this, Alex, you know, the headline over at USA Today in the first paragraph, let me read it for listeners, a secretive California outfit called American Police Force is taking over a two-year-old never-used prison in Hardin, Montana that was briefly considered as a possible spot for Guantanamo prisoners.
[00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:52.909]  So that is in the first paragraph of USA Today.
[00:14:53.149 --> 00:14:54.670]  We are checking our sources here.
[00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.031]  It's right in front of me.
[00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:57.852]  And again, I think that they're using this
[00:14:58.172 --> 00:15:05.177]  Guantanamo Prisoners excuse to say, yes, this will be a training facility for foreign troops and mercenary operations.
[00:15:05.217 --> 00:15:06.098]  That isn't an excuse.
[00:15:06.178 --> 00:15:07.799]  Guantanamo West, and I want to be clear.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:15.565]  We've been reporting this since Sunday, and Monday and Tuesday, and then on Wednesday and Thursday, into Thursday, and people were in denial.
[00:15:15.865 --> 00:15:18.327]  They said it was fake when we broke the MIAC report.
[00:15:18.747 --> 00:15:20.628]  They said it was fake when we broke the DHS report.
[00:15:20.969 --> 00:15:23.450]  They said it was fake when we broke that we were under level 6 in April.
[00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.132]  Two months later, it was admitted to mainstream news.
[00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:27.393]  Ladies and gentlemen, we don't make stuff up.
[00:15:27.453 --> 00:15:28.134]  This is real.
[00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:31.536]  This is a ghost site slash black site that we have on.
[00:15:31.576 --> 00:15:34.277]  This is a FEMA center they want to hold.
[00:15:34.718 --> 00:15:37.819]  She was telling me I saw blueprints all over the place, scanning them quickly.
[00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:40.281]  I was walking into the facility and she'd say, oh, don't tape that.
[00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:41.882]  Or don't, you know, don't show that.
[00:15:42.182 --> 00:15:46.925]  Where it was saying alien detention, you know, troop barracks.
[00:15:47.465 --> 00:15:48.185]  We're good to go.
[00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:13.474]  We went and interviewed bed and breakfasts, because there's hardly any hotels here.
[00:16:14.095 --> 00:16:17.978]  So we went to the one hotel, the one Motel 8, two of those.
[00:16:17.998 --> 00:16:21.221]  We went to three different bed and breakfasts at two of the places.
[00:16:21.541 --> 00:16:25.505]  They said, oh absolutely, Germans, Czechs, Brits.
[00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:33.663]  Uh, a lot of Serbs, really hardcore looking people, won't pay in cash, act really suspicious, they've been here for a year.
[00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:37.163]  I mean, this is insane, what we're dealing with up here.
[00:16:37.723 --> 00:16:42.304]  And they're just trying to act like it's all fine, we're not going to kill your apparent company, everything's fine, everything's wonderful.
[00:16:42.684 --> 00:16:44.485]  I mean, this is bizarro land.
[00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:48.646]  And then they try to start patrolling the town with their vehicles, that blew up in their face.
[00:16:48.666 --> 00:16:50.146]  Uh, this is insane.
[00:16:51.001 --> 00:16:58.103]  Well, you know, another question I would ask her is if those documents indeed are contracted by a different entity that is no longer involved.
[00:16:58.203 --> 00:16:59.143]  What entity is that?
[00:16:59.243 --> 00:17:00.863]  Surely she can tell you who that is.
[00:17:01.143 --> 00:17:08.725]  If she can't disclose... She won't disclose who the people who were going to make this Guantanamo West were, even though those documents were up everywhere.
[00:17:08.765 --> 00:17:12.346]  And she's saying that they left these documents at quote-unquote mustard packets.
[00:17:12.626 --> 00:17:14.066]  She won't say what company that is.
[00:17:14.306 --> 00:17:18.047]  Why protect a company that's no longer involved in this detention center, Alex?
[00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.152]  I think?
[00:17:23.374 --> 00:17:28.920]  This is just so incredible and so fast moving again within the past couple hours the Associated Press.
[00:17:37.635 --> 00:17:42.096]  Uh, running it, admitting they want to expand it at a 15,000 other acre facility they want to build.
[00:17:42.236 --> 00:17:44.617]  There's a British architect here in town designing it.
[00:17:44.937 --> 00:17:46.537]  This is the real deal, okay?
[00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:52.979]  This is a real live, ghost site FEMA camp in the making, on a silver platter, for everyone.
[00:17:53.319 --> 00:17:55.059]  This is the shadow government system.
[00:17:55.539 --> 00:17:59.260]  As all the old intel people told us decades ago, they said they will be run by foreign mercs.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:08.624]  Everything the old militia guy said is absolutely true, because they were all in the military, they were all in intelligence, they were all in African, Asian, Latin American, the Middle East, and saw how it was done there.
[00:18:08.964 --> 00:18:10.605]  And that is exactly what's being set up.
[00:18:10.725 --> 00:18:14.267]  They target this town because it's so poor, so they can take it over.
[00:18:14.307 --> 00:18:16.908]  They have this two rivers authority muscling around.
[00:18:17.588 --> 00:18:19.849]  The former director of this place's wife's running for mayor.
[00:18:20.229 --> 00:18:21.230]  I mean, this is serious.
[00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.571]  And it is dangerous, ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you that right now.
[00:18:23.891 --> 00:18:25.912]  Because they do have operators and people following us.
[00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.332]  We've been getting followed by white sedans.
[00:18:28.953 --> 00:18:31.036]  When we try to go and videotape them, they speed off.
[00:18:31.937 --> 00:18:34.421]  So this is serious business here in Arden, Montana.
[00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:38.049]  And Steve Quayle going to come up in the bottom of the hour.
[00:18:38.109 --> 00:18:40.370]  He'd like to break some news with you, Alex.
[00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.913]  So hopefully you'll be able to join us in another 20 or 25 minutes.
[00:18:43.953 --> 00:18:44.973]  It is incredible.
[00:18:45.053 --> 00:18:56.841]  Once again, we have somebody who is a convicted felon who has over a dozen aliases, who has a over a dozen felony convictions, who is a million plus in the hole from civil suits.
[00:18:57.101 --> 00:19:05.247]  He's lost a person who has presented himself as an arts dealer, a person who has presented himself as a car salesman, as an entrepreneur, as a restaurant owner.
[00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:09.770]  And a foreign merc... It blows my mind, Alex.
[00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.912]  This is who the New World Order uses.
[00:19:11.932 --> 00:19:15.634]  This is the shady criminals, 14-time felons they use as cut-out fronts.
[00:19:15.874 --> 00:19:20.758]  The New World Order is a criminal, rogue government operation to rape the hell out of the American people and people of the planet.
[00:19:20.938 --> 00:19:25.281]  If they greased 1,300,000 Iraqis, they'll do it here too, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:26.662]  That's why they staged the terror.
[00:19:26.702 --> 00:19:27.683]  That's why they do all of this.
[00:19:27.703 --> 00:19:28.824]  That's what this country is run by.
[00:19:28.864 --> 00:19:30.485]  It's criminals looting the hell out of us.
[00:19:31.317 --> 00:19:33.499]  And it continues and continues and continues.
[00:19:33.519 --> 00:19:38.202]  And again, this facility started in 2007 under the Bush administration.
[00:19:38.403 --> 00:19:40.825]  They waited for the Obama administration to come in.
[00:19:41.205 --> 00:19:44.447]  As the economy is gutted, now they're saying... Obama is looking at Montana.
[00:19:44.688 --> 00:19:47.310]  Two different facilities, this one and the other one.
[00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.052]  Yes, and they're integrating again.
[00:19:50.612 --> 00:19:54.996]  I am at a triple-confirmed, Merck-run facility.
[00:19:56.084 --> 00:19:56.824]  Just unbelievable.
[00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:22.638]  And I'm sure it will be confirmed that Blackwater is involved within the week, if not, within the next couple of days.
[00:20:22.699 --> 00:20:32.272]  Again, we are encouraging... What's he saying in his story that, I believe from memory, I might have heard in the middle of a concentration camp field, that it's confirmed Blackwater, that AFP brags they work with Blackwater.
[00:20:32.652 --> 00:20:33.372]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:33.552 --> 00:20:40.335]  From the screenshots and them trying to take certain links off their website, it becomes irrefutable.
[00:20:40.395 --> 00:20:50.459]  And now, again, we're having listeners call in with double confirmation saying they have contacted Blackwater and they have confirmed that they do have units moving into Montana as we speak.
[00:20:51.309 --> 00:20:52.730]  That's not just Steve saying that.
[00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.232]  I have people at grocery stores telling me.
[00:20:55.332 --> 00:20:57.453]  I have people that run bed and breakfasts telling me this.
[00:20:57.753 --> 00:21:03.457]  I have listeners calling in going, yeah, you drive along and there's troops crawling all around the side of the road and up the hills, and there's helicopters.
[00:21:04.258 --> 00:21:07.520]  Then I go in another bed and breakfast this morning, knock on the door, and a lady invites me in for coffee.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:15.225]  She goes, yeah, I go out and look for dinosaur bones and pig flowers, and black hawks fly right over.
[00:21:15.245 --> 00:21:18.067]  She said, this just happened to me last week, just right outside town.
[00:21:18.797 --> 00:21:21.419]  Alex on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[00:21:21.459 --> 00:21:22.239]  We'll be back after this.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.440]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.081]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:50.092]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:21:51.034 --> 00:21:53.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:56.305 --> 00:22:00.288]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:22:00.548 --> 00:22:02.330]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:10.836]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:22:11.076 --> 00:22:16.220]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:22:16.561 --> 00:22:18.182]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:22:18.402 --> 00:22:24.744]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:22:24.924 --> 00:22:35.666]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:22:35.966 --> 00:22:36.486]  That's right.
[00:22:36.747 --> 00:22:39.047]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[00:22:43.468 --> 00:23:01.337]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:23:01.477 --> 00:23:03.397]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[00:23:03.558 --> 00:23:05.839]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:23:05.999 --> 00:23:07.840]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.620]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.941]  There is a solution.
[00:23:11.161 --> 00:23:19.186]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:25:07.525 --> 00:25:08.025]  Go live!
[00:25:08.185 --> 00:25:12.407]  We are here at the Hardin Detention Facility in Hardin, Montana.
[00:25:12.507 --> 00:25:16.828]  We have Becky Shea, the spokesman for American Police Force, here at this detention facility.
[00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:24.251]  Steve Quill has major breaking news he's going to cover after he talks to Becky Shea, but I wanted to invite Steve on today because he originally really broke this.
[00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:27.252]  And he broke the felonies last Friday when he called me.
[00:25:27.573 --> 00:25:29.954]  I was so busy I didn't get on my radar screen until Sunday.
[00:25:30.394 --> 00:25:34.536]  It didn't break officially in mainstream news to the Billings Gazette yesterday.
[00:25:35.437 --> 00:25:41.900]  And so it's on the front page of the Billings Gazette again today that this Serb gentleman is this 14-time felon.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:48.624]  But I wanted to let Steve be able to talk to Becky Shea because she's been very, very helpful and has not been secretive like the other folks out here.
[00:25:48.684 --> 00:25:52.426]  So I wanted to hand the phone to her for five minutes and Steve Quill is going to give us
[00:25:53.306 --> 00:26:00.140]  Breaking news and developments, and then we'll throw it back to Jason Berman, whom I'll call in later in the next hour to recap this after the tour is complete.
[00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:02.164]  Steve Coyle, here is Becky Shea.
[00:26:02.806 --> 00:26:03.307]  Hi, Becky.
[00:26:03.982 --> 00:26:06.063]  Hey Steve, we were supposed to talk today.
[00:26:06.083 --> 00:26:08.743]  What a strange way to do it on Alex's phone, huh?
[00:26:09.063 --> 00:26:11.164]  Well, yeah, it's wonderful and thank you so much.
[00:26:11.184 --> 00:26:14.345]  Here's some of the questions that I think really need to be answered, okay?
[00:26:14.665 --> 00:26:26.889]  There has seemed to be a systematic effort to hide the true ownership, and I understand DPS, I understand the attorney Maziar Mopi, you know, describing the Santa Ana, California ownership, etc.
[00:26:26.949 --> 00:26:31.450]  But when you go to Angelino, or Eddie Angelino, have you ever met with him personally?
[00:26:32.623 --> 00:26:33.583]  No, Steve, I haven't.
[00:26:33.683 --> 00:26:41.845]  And I just want to let you know that, and just to be fair, I'm telling you up front, and I hope your listeners, you know, are we on the air?
[00:26:41.885 --> 00:26:43.086]  Are your listeners here with us?
[00:26:43.666 --> 00:26:45.086]  I just had Alex hand me a phone.
[00:26:45.106 --> 00:26:46.106]  I don't know who I'm talking to.
[00:26:46.126 --> 00:26:46.827]  Yes, we're on the air.
[00:26:47.227 --> 00:26:48.107]  Okay, we're on the air.
[00:26:48.127 --> 00:26:50.728]  I am not going to release
[00:26:52.802 --> 00:26:56.423]  The name of anyone we're affiliated with.
[00:26:57.264 --> 00:27:00.725]  And I know some of, you know, I've visited with Mr. Moffey.
[00:27:00.765 --> 00:27:04.887]  The other name that you mentioned is not a name that I recognize.
[00:27:05.627 --> 00:27:08.588]  I can speak and will only speak for APF.
[00:27:08.788 --> 00:27:13.110]  I can't speak to other corporations that you've visited with.
[00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:20.013]  The other thing that I want to let your listeners know, we are sitting in the edge.
[00:27:20.193 --> 00:27:22.194]  We are sitting in my block SUV.
[00:27:23.966 --> 00:27:29.175]  I am the only person with APF equipment in Hardin.
[00:27:29.195 --> 00:27:35.145]  There is no other equipment from APF in Hardin other than me and my laptop and this car.
[00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:41.935]  Well, I gotta tell you then, Becky, that contradicts multiple eyewitnesses that said initially there were 12, and then it went down to 3.
[00:27:42.436 --> 00:27:48.562]  And I have posted on my website the actual photographs of the seal that's at American Police Force.
[00:27:48.642 --> 00:27:57.291]  And so here's the question, why was... Okay, let me clarify for you that the seals were magnetic blockers that are gone.
[00:27:57.995 --> 00:28:08.800]  And I challenge you, and respectfully Steve, I really do, I challenge you respectfully to find good proof that there were twelve vehicles in this town.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.581]  Only three came into town and I got one of them.
[00:28:12.081 --> 00:28:14.623]  Okay, forgive me, that's why we're talking Becky.
[00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:21.293]  With all due respect to your sources, there were not 12 APS vehicles in this town.
[00:28:21.653 --> 00:28:23.354]  Okay, now let's go to the issue.
[00:28:23.674 --> 00:28:26.836]  The privatization of Police Force and Harden, okay?
[00:28:27.196 --> 00:28:43.064]  The idea was that there were those decals and obviously someone gave the order to take them off because it was causing controversy when apparently, and since you won't discuss the ownership of the company, and I respect that, okay?
[00:28:43.484 --> 00:28:56.494]  But I'm only going to tell you that there's independent verification that has been supplied to both Alex Jones and myself from people in the law enforcement community showing... Alex Jones Product Solutions.
[00:28:56.994 --> 00:28:58.815]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:28:59.156 --> 00:29:05.160]  Foreign ownership and aliases used that would, I think, make most Americans go, there's something going on.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.522]  Now, are you familiar with the main reason why?
[00:29:07.962 --> 00:29:15.007]  Alex, myself and others are concerned when we hear about the privatization and the takeover of police forces in America.
[00:29:15.027 --> 00:29:15.867]  Let me explain.
[00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:18.329]  Let's talk about that privatization issue, okay?
[00:29:18.349 --> 00:29:18.529]  Okay.
[00:29:25.955 --> 00:29:34.751]  Under Montana law, the only entity that can provide law enforcement services is local government.
[00:29:35.011 --> 00:29:35.793]  Hold on one second, Becky.
[00:29:35.833 --> 00:29:36.694]  Hold on one second, Steve.
[00:29:38.422 --> 00:29:43.086]  Steve, are you getting it that another cutout is defense product solutions out of Karachi, Pakistan?
[00:29:43.146 --> 00:29:47.229]  Because that's where the website goes to American police force.
[00:29:47.689 --> 00:29:49.831]  Yeah, and when I say it to Becky, her eyes light up.
[00:29:50.191 --> 00:29:53.393]  That is an additional cutout for Kuwait, okay?
[00:29:53.714 --> 00:29:55.835]  And just, I want to put Becky on notice, Becky.
[00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:57.917]  Not on notice, but I just want to give you information.
[00:29:58.017 --> 00:29:59.718]  I'm going to hand you back over to her, Steve.
[00:29:59.718 --> 00:30:00.779]  I'm going to hand you back over.
[00:30:00.819 --> 00:30:02.000]  I just wanted to get that out right now.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.344]  Folks, this is mega huge because this is a plan for the whole United States.
[00:30:05.724 --> 00:30:13.332]  And Becky, isn't it true that I've seen you quoted in the news and talking to folks on the phone that I've talked to that the American police force does plan other facilities around the country?
[00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:27.277]  Okay, first of all, I want to explain to people that I have a face for radio, and when Alex came over here and leaned in and yelled into the phone to Steve, my face lit up because I just thought it was funnier than I'll get out.
[00:30:27.297 --> 00:30:31.740]  That's the only—I just looked at you and went, oh my god— There's no Serbs, there's no Muslims, everything's fine.
[00:30:33.182 --> 00:30:35.864]  You know, you're just talking to a nice Montana girl right now.
[00:30:36.845 --> 00:30:38.226]  Steve, let me get back on topic.
[00:30:38.306 --> 00:30:39.327]  I'm a nice Montana boy!
[00:30:39.347 --> 00:30:40.488]  I know you are!
[00:30:40.508 --> 00:30:41.649]  That's why we're talking!
[00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:52.058]  I want to get back on topic for just a minute, but if you would please give me the opportunity to respond to the question that we were on when Alex came over and crocked me up.
[00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:57.162]  And we were talking about, what I was saying was the only...
[00:30:58.967 --> 00:31:04.771]  The only way that law enforcement services can be delivered in Montana is through a local governmental entity.
[00:31:05.752 --> 00:31:08.353]  Now, that's the city of Hardin.
[00:31:09.054 --> 00:31:15.498]  And I'm sure you understand, and I think your Montana listeners understand, that your audience is much larger than that.
[00:31:15.538 --> 00:31:20.181]  So give me three minutes to explain the context of why Hardin doesn't have a police force.
[00:31:20.361 --> 00:31:21.402]  Do we have time to do that?
[00:31:22.302 --> 00:31:22.723]  Absolutely.
[00:31:23.323 --> 00:31:23.683]  Okay.
[00:31:24.484 --> 00:31:24.804]  Back in 1976,
[00:31:26.954 --> 00:31:36.001]  Hardin and Bighorn County took advantage or used the structure allowed under Montana law to consolidate their law enforcement services.
[00:31:37.002 --> 00:31:44.709]  By doing so, the Sheriff's Office provides all in law enforcement within the City of Hardin in addition to all of Bighorn County.
[00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:54.216]  There has been negotiations between the City and County most recently that have come to the point that they are
[00:31:55.436 --> 00:31:56.577]  We're good to go.
[00:32:19.235 --> 00:32:30.182]  This summer, when TRA, Two Rivers Authority Hardened Economic Development Arm, was working with representatives of APS2, Alex was laying in at me again and I jumped.
[00:32:30.402 --> 00:32:32.124]  Hold on one second, hold on one second.
[00:32:32.464 --> 00:32:42.991]  Steve, I just want to bring up Article 2, Section 33 of the Montana Incorporation as a state and a legislature and a duly convened powers of the people in the sovereign state of Montana in the United States.
[00:32:43.591 --> 00:32:54.907]  It says, importation of armed persons, no armed person or persons of armed body of men shall be brought into the state for the preservation of peace or the suppression of domestic violence is stepped upon application of the legislature or of the governor.
[00:32:55.388 --> 00:32:58.653]  The legislature cannot be convened for further, and then it goes on.
[00:32:59.233 --> 00:33:00.513]  Now, here's the issue.
[00:33:00.753 --> 00:33:02.514]  They did put the decals on the cars.
[00:33:02.774 --> 00:33:07.235]  The head of the Port Authority, as they call it, Two Rivers, has said that it's a wish list.
[00:33:07.715 --> 00:33:09.775]  You know, the point is, you've got a 14-time felon.
[00:33:09.955 --> 00:33:11.016]  You've got all this secrecy.
[00:33:11.056 --> 00:33:12.576]  They won't tell us who the owner of the company is.
[00:33:12.636 --> 00:33:21.898]  Becky, you're nice to talk to us and we appreciate it, but people are concerned and freaked out about all of this because every red flag you could push up is popping up.
[00:33:21.938 --> 00:33:22.718]  We've got Arabs.
[00:33:23.018 --> 00:33:23.879]  We've got Serbs.
[00:33:23.939 --> 00:33:24.779]  We've got Germans.
[00:33:24.819 --> 00:33:25.539]  We've got Brits.
[00:33:25.999 --> 00:33:27.781]  Crawling all over the place around here.
[00:33:28.061 --> 00:33:29.182]  The people are freaking out.
[00:33:29.302 --> 00:33:31.563]  I mean, is this some type of Red Dawn scenario, Becky?
[00:33:32.504 --> 00:33:36.988]  Alex, if you could've taken the phone away from me, you'd know that we were already talking about that.
[00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:41.271]  Stay and listen, or leave me alone, buddy.
[00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:42.112]  Come on!
[00:33:42.212 --> 00:33:43.112]  Okay, here's the deal.
[00:33:43.653 --> 00:33:43.833]  So...
[00:33:44.614 --> 00:33:53.056]  As part of meeting the needs of the City of Hardin, where we're coming in and we're going to be a neighbor, Hardin said, we need help with infrastructure.
[00:33:53.236 --> 00:33:56.957]  APF said, we want to provide your first vehicle.
[00:33:57.398 --> 00:33:58.058]  We'll bring them in.
[00:33:58.098 --> 00:33:59.278]  You can have the vehicle.
[00:34:00.358 --> 00:34:02.719]  Now, this was before I was hired with APF.
[00:34:03.159 --> 00:34:12.002]  The decision was made to buy temporary prototype magnetic placards to go on the doors that would say,
[00:34:14.154 --> 00:34:17.597]  That would let the people of Hardin know what their police vehicles could look like.
[00:34:18.038 --> 00:34:24.584]  One of the things that your kind viewers who took those pictures and provided to you of the decals, right?
[00:34:24.724 --> 00:34:26.225]  Steve, you got those pictures?
[00:34:26.306 --> 00:34:27.126]  Alex said he did.
[00:34:27.146 --> 00:34:28.087]  Yes, I did.
[00:34:28.107 --> 00:34:28.448]  Hello?
[00:34:28.888 --> 00:34:38.497]  Okay, the thing that they missed was the sign on the back window that said, not for official use in transport only.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.642]  So, they didn't get the whole picture.
[00:34:42.702 --> 00:34:45.304]  It's kind of like the 312 thing we talked about.
[00:34:45.444 --> 00:34:49.147]  Let me keep doing it, because I promised your listeners that I would explain this to them.
[00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:50.688]  Right, but you've had now three minutes.
[00:34:50.708 --> 00:34:52.329]  Let me just respond one minute to that.
[00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:53.450]  No, no, wait a minute.
[00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:55.672]  Alex took the phone for 90 seconds.
[00:34:55.972 --> 00:34:59.715]  Alex came on the line and he talked about bringing armed folks into Montana.
[00:34:59.735 --> 00:35:02.276]  The gentleman... No, no, it's the state constitution.
[00:35:02.297 --> 00:35:04.838]  I know it's evil, but... No, it's not evil.
[00:35:04.878 --> 00:35:05.579]  I live by it.
[00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:08.710]  Well, you can't say that because it is unconstitutional.
[00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:12.012]  You can't say you live by something that's unconstitutional.
[00:35:12.292 --> 00:35:15.013]  Now, the thing that is, that I think you need to be aware... Now, let me finish.
[00:35:15.353 --> 00:35:16.794]  No, you need to be aware... Please, let me finish.
[00:35:17.074 --> 00:35:21.216]  No, let me finish, because you're saying something that I don't get a chance to respond to, okay?
[00:35:21.276 --> 00:35:21.957]  Okay, okay.
[00:35:21.977 --> 00:35:24.498]  Those people carried a Serbian crest on them.
[00:35:24.958 --> 00:35:28.140]  We tracked the ownership of the company that used that.
[00:35:28.541 --> 00:35:30.662]  APF took down their website.
[00:35:31.022 --> 00:35:32.063]  Seriously, you need to know this.
[00:35:32.083 --> 00:35:34.585]  Well, my webmaster and I were on the phone.
[00:35:34.885 --> 00:35:37.166]  It was down, it was up, it was down, it was up.
[00:35:37.547 --> 00:35:45.412]  The thing is, is that one thing led to another, Becky, and I'm just saying this, it is conceivable that what you know is what you know, what you've been told, and you take it
[00:35:45.672 --> 00:35:45.992]  Let me finish.
[00:35:46.052 --> 00:35:47.493]  Let me address two topics that you've brought to me.
[00:35:47.513 --> 00:35:47.954]  Number one is
[00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.672]  Is the section of our Constitution that Alex read to you.
[00:36:16.092 --> 00:36:23.717]  The context that that was brought up in is how are you going to stop a detention facility and do it within the Constitution?
[00:36:23.837 --> 00:36:27.299]  What we do is we do it legally.
[00:36:27.339 --> 00:36:28.600]  We hire local people.
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:32.802]  We train them to the level required by the state of Montana.
[00:36:32.822 --> 00:36:35.604]  And the state of Montana has stringent certification.
[00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:37.205]  Correct.
[00:36:37.345 --> 00:36:37.525]  Yes sir.
[00:37:02.369 --> 00:37:02.990]  Okay, good.
[00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:10.296]  Steve, I just want to give her the last word and throw it to you in this segment and the next for the other breaking news you have.
[00:37:10.336 --> 00:37:13.278]  But I want to give Becky, just as we go to break here, about two minutes.
[00:37:13.298 --> 00:37:14.780]  Then you throw it to break in the last two minutes.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.700]  Come back with Steve Coyle.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.221]  Okay, Steve?
[00:37:16.481 --> 00:37:16.922]  That's fine.
[00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:18.643]  Okay, here's Becky.
[00:37:18.663 --> 00:37:20.465]  Becky, a final comment, because we're about to go to break.
[00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:28.952]  Steve, my only comment at this point is that I want to thank you and Alex and all of your listeners for giving me an opportunity to talk today.
[00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:35.855]  As I've said in local media all day, my focus is on the people of Hardin and some of them are gathered around me now.
[00:37:36.336 --> 00:37:43.702]  We're going to be outside now because I'm going to finish the tour of the property here, so I'm going to say goodbye to you and your viewers, or your listeners.
[00:37:43.963 --> 00:37:44.944]  Thank you very much.
[00:37:45.164 --> 00:37:49.928]  Steve, you and I had a little plan to meet and have me be on your show.
[00:37:50.869 --> 00:37:56.514]  You kind of got a little bit usurped by Alex there, so let's you and I do another show together, okay?
[00:37:57.296 --> 00:37:59.037]  Sure, but again, I want to make it clear.
[00:37:59.097 --> 00:38:05.882]  Steve, I want to get your comment and then I'm going to get off the phone and let you come back in the next segment.
[00:38:06.523 --> 00:38:09.445]  I just want to point out that all these people running this are foreigners.
[00:38:09.485 --> 00:38:13.488]  They have to hire a local to be their front person because they're all foreigners.
[00:38:13.808 --> 00:38:20.593]  Right, and Alex, the main issue is that the hardened city limits versus the reservations.
[00:38:20.613 --> 00:38:23.535]  There are different laws that apply to reservations.
[00:38:23.695 --> 00:38:24.616]  This is on the reservation.
[00:38:24.676 --> 00:38:28.479]  Hartman, for those that don't know, is on the line of the State and the Crow.
[00:38:28.619 --> 00:38:29.960]  That's what it says on my road map.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.961]  They gave me at their car rental.
[00:38:31.001 --> 00:38:31.521]  Is that correct?
[00:38:32.742 --> 00:38:33.763]  Yes, it is.
[00:38:33.783 --> 00:38:34.503]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:38:34.984 --> 00:38:40.568]  And for those that will talk when we come back after the break, all you have to see is the parallel to the cabazon.
[00:38:45.282 --> 00:38:46.062]  You don't know about it?
[00:38:46.362 --> 00:38:56.484]  What that means is you can get away with, oh let's use the word, you can get away with everything you want that's unconstitutional when you're doing it in a territory versus the United States.
[00:38:56.544 --> 00:39:01.025]  So there are legal questions, and I believe that's what the real crux of the matter is.
[00:39:01.245 --> 00:39:03.046]  You can do things in a reservation.
[00:39:03.326 --> 00:39:09.247]  We have the Cabazon Indian Reservation in California, Inslaw Promise Software, CIA, and that's where it all goes, Alex.
[00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:12.729]  I think we just dropped Alex Jones.
[00:39:12.749 --> 00:39:14.290]  We have Steve Quayle with us.
[00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:17.331]  Alex Jones on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[00:39:17.631 --> 00:39:19.111]  This is just simply unbelievable.
[00:39:19.311 --> 00:39:26.033]  She's pretty much confirming that this is a foreign-run merc service called American Police Force.
[00:39:26.073 --> 00:39:27.033]  How ironic.
[00:39:27.333 --> 00:39:28.614]  It is hardly American.
[00:39:28.874 --> 00:39:36.116]  It is hardly what the Founding Fathers stood for, to bring in foreign mercenaries to police the American populace, Steve.
[00:39:36.724 --> 00:39:52.455]  Well, absolutely, Jason, and I'm looking at the aliases of one man that supposedly is the head of the APF, and we've got at least a half a dozen, no, I'm sorry, one, two, I'll count them off screen, I'll send this to you, probably eight or nine Middle Eastern aliases.
[00:39:52.575 --> 00:39:59.640]  You guys track the Pakistani tie, I track the Kuwaiti tie, you know, the bottom line is that we're really, really
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.842]  Dealing with, can I tell you something?
[00:40:01.863 --> 00:40:03.124]  We're dealing with the surface.
[00:40:03.184 --> 00:40:04.806]  I understand the hardened people.
[00:40:04.866 --> 00:40:05.547]  They want jobs.
[00:40:05.587 --> 00:40:06.969]  That place has been so depressed.
[00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:08.151]  That's not the issue.
[00:40:08.191 --> 00:40:15.741]  The issue is, is there major foreign entities that are going to be training mercs used against us?
[00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:19.325]  And it's the ideal place to take people under whatever.
[00:40:19.385 --> 00:40:22.729]  Now look, I stand by the person that sent me the information.
[00:40:23.029 --> 00:40:29.717]  They were told by a city council member that the whole situation was the forced vaccinations, the gun issue, etc.
[00:40:29.797 --> 00:40:32.180]  And when we come back, I want to address those with Alex.
[00:40:32.944 --> 00:40:33.504]  Absolutely.
[00:40:33.544 --> 00:40:35.225]  We're going to have you on for one more segment.
[00:40:35.265 --> 00:40:36.506]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:40:36.526 --> 00:40:37.886]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[00:40:37.946 --> 00:40:43.469]  Just an amazing amount of intel coming in from Hardin, Montana.
[00:40:43.529 --> 00:40:45.730]  Again, USA Today picking up on the story.
[00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:48.311]  The Boston Herald picking up on the story.
[00:40:48.951 --> 00:40:54.234]  It's just unbelievable to me that we now live in a country where they can hire a multiple
[00:40:54.714 --> 00:40:55.415]  We're good to go.
[00:41:10.416 --> 00:41:11.717]  And Afghanistan.
[00:41:11.777 --> 00:41:14.317]  And this is the guy that's going to head this up.
[00:41:14.377 --> 00:41:20.319]  And like you said, they're going to use tribal lands to train foreign mercenaries and militaries.
[00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:36.485]  This was foreshadowed this summer with National Level Exercise 09, where they went into FEMA Region 6, which included Montana, by the way, and they took over national, regional, local, and tribal governments, prepping them for this situation.
[00:41:36.585 --> 00:41:39.766]  And now we have it coming to fruition in front of our eyes, Steve.
[00:41:40.615 --> 00:41:43.257]  Well, and you've laid it out absolutely perfectly.
[00:41:43.317 --> 00:41:45.919]  The thing is, though, the timetable has now been moved up.
[00:41:46.479 --> 00:41:49.021]  And that's the thing, Jason, that I'm really concerned with.
[00:41:49.061 --> 00:41:52.824]  Because, well, Alex is on the ground in Hardin, Montana, having flown into Billings.
[00:41:53.244 --> 00:41:55.006]  All the people he's meeting there.
[00:41:55.026 --> 00:41:57.428]  I mean, I'll tell you one thing that Montanans are.
[00:41:57.468 --> 00:42:01.130]  Montanans just, they say it like they see it, and they call it like it is.
[00:42:01.491 --> 00:42:01.771]  Okay?
[00:42:02.131 --> 00:42:03.351]  We're too rural.
[00:42:03.391 --> 00:42:05.072]  Where Alex is is incredibly rural.
[00:42:05.692 --> 00:42:09.493]  The area around the Prior Mountains is incredibly rural.
[00:42:09.513 --> 00:42:17.475]  So when you've got hard-working Montanans, eyewitnesses, talking to Alex and sending me emails while we're on the air together, I've got to tell you something.
[00:42:17.515 --> 00:42:18.975]  This isn't Bravo Sierra.
[00:42:19.055 --> 00:42:21.756]  This is real-time warning.
[00:42:22.156 --> 00:42:23.636]  And here's the thing that people don't understand.
[00:42:24.156 --> 00:42:27.099]  This is how they're working across the country today.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:35.748]  The powers that be that are going to put us under martial law are buying off, bribing, and giving bonuses, if you will, to people that tell on people.
[00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:38.111]  I mean, this is just so out of control.
[00:42:39.973 --> 00:42:46.821]  They are targeting economically destitute areas where people are willing to go along to get along.
[00:42:47.562 --> 00:42:49.124]  Next segment coming up with Steve Quayle.
[00:42:49.184 --> 00:42:50.145]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:50.165 --> 00:42:53.829]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in the latest over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:42:58.146 --> 00:42:59.366]  Remain in your houses.
[00:43:00.167 --> 00:43:05.328]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:43:05.928 --> 00:43:06.949]  Will they do it?
[00:43:07.289 --> 00:43:09.249]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:15.931]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:43:16.372 --> 00:43:17.612]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:43:18.553 --> 00:43:22.074]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[00:43:22.835 --> 00:43:27.116]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:43:27.716 --> 00:43:31.978]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:43:32.618 --> 00:43:37.440]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:46.466]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[00:43:46.786 --> 00:43:49.068]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.

[00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:55.272]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:43:56.488 --> 00:43:58.170]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:01.914]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:44:02.114 --> 00:44:03.956]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:44:04.597 --> 00:44:07.340]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.462]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[00:44:11.892 --> 00:44:12.232]  We're good.
[00:44:41.852 --> 00:44:42.273]  Yes, yes I'm ready.
[00:44:57.014 --> 00:45:07.096]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:45:07.577 --> 00:45:08.637]  Garden in a Can.
[00:45:08.997 --> 00:45:12.578]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[00:45:13.138 --> 00:45:14.918]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[00:45:15.158 --> 00:45:17.459]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[00:45:17.939 --> 00:45:26.930]  There are 16 large, hermetically sealed, non-hybrid, open-pollinated packets of seeds, along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[00:45:27.603 --> 00:45:28.623]  Garden in a Can.
[00:45:29.023 --> 00:45:29.883]  It's that simple.
[00:45:30.223 --> 00:45:32.104]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[00:45:32.624 --> 00:45:36.585]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[00:45:36.965 --> 00:45:37.885]  Ready when you are.
[00:45:38.545 --> 00:45:42.166]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a Can.
[00:45:42.606 --> 00:45:45.706]  For more details visit GardenInACan.com today.

[00:46:03.669 --> 00:46:04.290]  We are back.
[00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:05.351]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:05.391 --> 00:46:06.452]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in.
[00:46:06.592 --> 00:46:15.942]  Alex on the ground in Hardin, Montana, getting the tour from Becky Shea, the front person, the spokeswoman for all of this, only divulging so much.
[00:46:16.042 --> 00:46:20.127]  Very nice, well-meaning lady, but we've got a ton of well-meaning idiots out there.
[00:46:20.447 --> 00:46:22.868]  that are allowing this progression to occur.
[00:46:22.928 --> 00:46:31.112]  I really hope that she decides it's not enough to just go along to get along and she realizes that this is a violation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:46:31.152 --> 00:46:35.874]  This is against everything that Americans who believe in those documents stand for.
[00:46:36.214 --> 00:46:43.437]  Steve, can you just give us a quick overview of how this has developed over the last week and then the FBI ties you just discussed with me off air?
[00:46:43.991 --> 00:47:01.017]  Well, I think the thing that people need to understand real quickly is this has been developing, especially in Hart, Montana, over the last, probably, year, primarily, and economically destitute areas, not just in Montana, but in other states, that can be used for training of foreign mercenaries, and let's call them what they are, Jason.
[00:47:01.597 --> 00:47:02.138]  I don't think so.
[00:47:16.374 --> 00:47:42.951]  The idea simply is to pre-position the troops that all of us have been warning about for years, and not only the ones that are currently pre-positioned throughout the country, but when the Declaration of Martial Law is declared either by a weapon of mass destruction over Washington, D.C., New York, London, wherever it proceeds from, or if the biological plague generated in the laboratory, in which, by the way, Jason, two more bio-agents of world renown have just been murdered in the last two weeks.
[00:47:43.091 --> 00:47:43.531]  Murdered.
[00:47:43.972 --> 00:47:45.693]  The idea is this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:46.113 --> 00:47:56.100]  That we're talking about a reservation town, Hardin, Montana, that's been hit by incredibly, incredibly bad economics.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.701]  We have a good idea.
[00:47:57.721 --> 00:47:59.942]  There was a $27 million prison built there.
[00:48:00.323 --> 00:48:02.804]  Basically, it did not meet state specifications.
[00:48:03.225 --> 00:48:12.291]  Our governor and I think one or two of our senators were sued to be able to allow the private utilization of that
[00:48:13.011 --> 00:48:13.472]  Uh, prison.
[00:48:13.512 --> 00:48:28.381]  Now, isn't it interesting that the only prison that could be utilized, at least the only available prison, is in Hardin, Montana, which happens to be on a reservation which fits the same category as Guantanamo Bay, which basically Alex brought up.
[00:48:29.082 --> 00:48:29.782]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:48.593 --> 00:49:03.983]  With who knows what's going on up there, and that's in Great Falls, and then we've got the reports of 7,000 mercenaries of Blackwater being hired to secure the Montana border against people fleeing the United States into Canada when it all comes down.
[00:49:04.603 --> 00:49:10.967]  So we've got all of this being focused right now on Hardin, Montana, and as Alex said, hey, you just had it too.
[00:49:10.987 --> 00:49:27.118]  We've got a felon who seems to be the front man, but when we go beyond the front men, when we go beyond the front women, and we get to the heart of the matter, we've got the potential to have a very, very major strategic placement
[00:49:27.478 --> 00:49:32.862]  Of foreign troops, mercenaries, and quite candidly, the money that it brings in is nothing.
[00:49:32.902 --> 00:49:37.386]  That's the only way I can get a chance to ask Becky is, where does all this money come from?
[00:49:37.686 --> 00:49:41.789]  Because what we're looking at is basically very sophisticated funds.
[00:49:42.129 --> 00:49:47.233]  We're looking at a model where you basically come in and buy the population, economically distressed areas.
[00:49:47.494 --> 00:49:51.637]  And they're doing the same thing, by the way, in major cities across the United States, in giant warehouses.
[00:49:52.037 --> 00:49:54.439]  So we're at the point now where
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.316]  Where the timetable has been ramped and amped up.
[00:49:58.336 --> 00:49:59.281]  How much time do we have?
[00:49:59.687 --> 00:50:02.408]  We got about 60 seconds in this segment.
[00:50:02.908 --> 00:50:06.909]  On the other side, Steve, I want you to discuss how far this goes.
[00:50:06.989 --> 00:50:08.809]  I mean, is this a federal program?
[00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:14.291]  We've heard Obama say we need a police force that's just as strong, just as well-funded as the military.
[00:50:14.331 --> 00:50:17.792]  We've seen the Youth Corps being rolled out through City Year.
[00:50:17.832 --> 00:50:21.853]  We've seen the economy becoming crushed as they announce a carbon tax.
[00:50:22.053 --> 00:50:26.934]  We've seen them say, no, there aren't mandatory vaccinations, but the military has mandatory vaccinations.
[00:50:26.974 --> 00:50:27.855]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:27.875 --> 00:50:28.496]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:48.892]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:50:49.352 --> 00:50:52.513]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:50:52.974 --> 00:50:57.336]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:50:57.556 --> 00:51:03.139]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[00:51:03.419 --> 00:51:07.923]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:51:08.203 --> 00:51:11.246]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:51:11.826 --> 00:51:16.250]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:22.936]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:51:23.216 --> 00:51:25.158]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:51:25.638 --> 00:51:28.460]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[00:51:33.343 --> 00:51:35.044]  That's MySolarBackup.com.

[00:51:35.564 --> 00:51:36.085]  Don't wait.
[00:51:36.105 --> 00:51:36.665]  Call today.
[00:51:36.745 --> 00:51:37.766]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:37.846 --> 00:51:39.046]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:59.551 --> 00:51:59.854]  I don't know.
[00:52:07.006 --> 00:52:08.026]  We are back live.
[00:52:08.086 --> 00:52:09.307]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:52:09.327 --> 00:52:15.949]  I'm Jason Burmas, sitting in as Alex is on the ground at Hardin, Montana, getting a tour of this Two Rivers facility.
[00:52:16.329 --> 00:52:20.730]  USA Today, the Boston Herald, the Associated Press have all picked up on this story.
[00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:29.893]  This is being run, not by my words, but by the Billing Gazette and others, by a hardened criminal, a multiple felon, somebody who uses multiple aliases.
[00:52:30.273 --> 00:52:34.474]  This screams of a globalist operation, but I'm going to give it to Steve Quayle.
[00:52:35.034 --> 00:52:38.495]  To break down how far down the rabbit hole this actually goes.
[00:52:38.535 --> 00:52:38.855]  Steve?
[00:52:39.536 --> 00:52:48.659]  Well, it's interesting because you've done such a wonderful job, Jason, of telling people about, look, we've heard the words from the presidential administration that they want a private police force.
[00:52:48.699 --> 00:53:02.784]  We're now seeing everything that we saw in pre-, and I say this, in the time between the breakdown of the German economy, the Weimar Republic, and the rise of a National Socialist known as the Nazis, we're seeing such a
[00:53:02.964 --> 00:53:10.207]  A parallel, and we're also seeing the introduction of foreign troops into this country on unimagined levels.
[00:53:10.667 --> 00:53:15.509]  Everybody, Jason, as you know, you guys have been reporting on it on your radio show and on your website.
[00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:18.730]  I mean, the amount of military transportation.
[00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:21.671]  There are people that are high-ranking military officials.
[00:53:21.751 --> 00:53:25.753]  I mean, they've never seen such a thing like this, even in the build-up to the first Gulf War.
[00:53:26.293 --> 00:53:27.894]  Nothing like this has ever occurred.
[00:53:28.314 --> 00:53:32.497]  The idea that the black helicopters... How about the situation in Tennessee?
[00:53:32.817 --> 00:53:37.521]  Where the 101st Airborne, I believe, is dropping in on a little town.
[00:53:37.601 --> 00:53:41.243]  And did you see the operational plan for that?
[00:53:41.283 --> 00:53:43.605]  They're seeking one individual.
[00:53:43.885 --> 00:53:50.710]  Come on, you don't drop in 340 paratroopers or whatever the final count is to go after one guy, or do you?
[00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:52.491]  Let me tell you what I'm being told.
[00:53:52.551 --> 00:53:53.412]  I'm being told now
[00:53:53.872 --> 00:54:04.602]  That the FBI director has gone to major cities and been telling them to prepare the special agents in charge of these facts are being told, get ready, get ready, get ready.
[00:54:04.662 --> 00:54:09.006]  So I don't know the timetable, but they seem to know the timetable.
[00:54:09.486 --> 00:54:13.190]  I have been told from deep pool, from people deep on the inside,
[00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:25.319]  That the fact is that bounties are being given for military to inform on other high-ranking military members that won't go along with the anti-constitutional basically grab for the government.
[00:54:25.719 --> 00:54:38.068]  I'm being told that even in police departments, Jason, that now a lot of the law enforcement officers that listen to Alex, listen to myself, listen to others on a warning, are starting to notice the presence
[00:54:38.468 --> 00:54:48.535]  Of high-ranking, and in many cases people that outrank them, foreigners put in, inserted into their law enforcement departments to seemingly be observers.
[00:54:48.975 --> 00:55:06.708]  We're being told that a $500,000 bounty is being offered for, again, about a half a million bucks, ladies and gentlemen, for people to inform on, military people to inform on each other, high-ranking police to segregate out and designate out what they're calling resistors.
[00:55:07.188 --> 00:55:12.138]  I've been told by people that were recently at Fort Bliss as late or as early as that.
[00:55:12.987 --> 00:55:24.336]  Monday of this week, that when the military is getting ready to deploy to Iraq, they'll have a federal official walk in, this will really happen, and make the statement, I hope there are no Tea Party members here.
[00:55:24.356 --> 00:55:32.022]  And one brave American soldier stood up and said, Sir, I am and I will defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:55:32.323 --> 00:55:34.865]  And all the men applauded and stood with that man.
[00:55:34.905 --> 00:55:36.626]  That's that Fort Bliss at the beginning of the week.
[00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:38.568]  So what's happening is this.
[00:55:39.048 --> 00:55:45.713]  It's obvious, it's right in front of our face, and the idea of the orchestrated meltdown of the economy, all this is linked.
[00:55:46.093 --> 00:55:55.860]  The genetically altered viruses, H1N1, H5N1, all of this stuff, the Ebola smallpox, the Spanish flu, the dead scientists, it's all coming in.
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.942]  This is not a conspiracy, this is happening now!
[00:55:59.322 --> 00:56:04.186]  And so the point is, is that as Alex is saying, and he's in Hardin, Montana,
[00:56:04.466 --> 00:56:04.786]  I think
[00:56:24.718 --> 00:56:29.059]  People are now sensing, Jason, that they can identify what's going on.
[00:56:29.099 --> 00:56:34.920]  This uneasy feeling, I don't know how many people you talk to a day that actually get it and say, hey, I'm finally getting it.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.981]  But people are finally getting it.
[00:56:37.441 --> 00:56:44.803]  And I believe that, obviously, what we're seeing right now in Harden is only, if you will, the head, and I'll use it, a pimple.
[00:56:46.244 --> 00:56:47.645]  That everybody's got to understand.
[00:56:47.665 --> 00:56:52.869]  It's the acclamation of the American public to the police state, the military like never before.
[00:56:52.929 --> 00:56:55.692]  Back after this with Steve Quayle, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:59.215]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:56:59.635 --> 00:57:04.600]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.701]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:57:07.002 --> 00:57:11.786]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:57:11.986 --> 00:57:12.967]  How much do you want?
[00:57:13.167 --> 00:57:13.927]  When do you want it?
[00:57:14.307 --> 00:57:15.848]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:57:16.128 --> 00:57:16.949]  When will you need it?
[00:57:17.189 --> 00:57:19.270]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:20.491]  Will there be any food?
[00:57:20.731 --> 00:57:22.071]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:57:22.271 --> 00:57:27.334]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:57:27.534 --> 00:57:30.656]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:57:31.116 --> 00:57:34.619]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:57:34.919 --> 00:57:35.920]  How much will you need?
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:36.780]  We don't know.
[00:57:37.061 --> 00:57:37.961]  How much do you want?
[00:57:38.161 --> 00:57:38.902]  All you can get.
[00:57:39.082 --> 00:57:39.943]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:40.183 --> 00:57:42.945]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:57:45.027 --> 00:57:45.927]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:57:55.683 --> 00:58:00.850]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:05.356]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:58:05.516 --> 00:58:07.379]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:58:07.799 --> 00:58:09.141]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:58:09.421 --> 00:58:10.463]  There is a solution.
[00:58:10.683 --> 00:58:18.709]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:59:57.245 --> 00:59:59.426]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:00.006 --> 01:00:02.867]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.028 --> 01:00:05.108]  We are back live.
[01:00:05.148 --> 01:00:06.129]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.229 --> 01:00:08.269]  Alex to pop in at the bottom of this hour.
[01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:12.511]  If you've missed any of this power-packed program, you're going to want to get the podcast.
[01:00:12.811 --> 01:00:19.694]  We are exposing foreign mercenaries in the United States training at a FEMA facility
[01:00:21.039 --> 01:00:22.780]  In Hardin, Montana.
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.081]  Simply incredible.
[01:00:24.281 --> 01:00:29.504]  The American public are being acclimated like never before to military on the streets.
[01:00:29.524 --> 01:00:30.945]  And I want to make this point, Steve.
[01:00:31.325 --> 01:00:32.306]  You know, U.S.
[01:00:32.366 --> 01:00:36.229]  military are going to have a hard time firing on U.S.
[01:00:36.249 --> 01:00:36.609]  citizens.
[01:00:36.629 --> 01:00:38.190]  A lot of people are going to have a problem with that.
[01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:41.652]  But when you bring in foreign military troops and they're under foreign command,
[01:00:42.012 --> 01:00:46.596]  They are much more likely to put a bullet in the back of your head to make a point.
[01:00:46.636 --> 01:00:52.282]  And that is what is so dangerous, not only having the military on the streets, but foreign mercenaries as well.
[01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:55.422]  Well, and you bring up the most important point, Jason.
[01:00:55.442 --> 01:01:05.946]  Those targets that have already been assigned, as Alex was targeted in the piece with 25 other people that are on Obama's hit list, listen, these people are already assigned.
[01:01:05.986 --> 01:01:08.046]  The GPSing was the giveaway.
[01:01:08.426 --> 01:01:15.269]  And I've been told by the military that the GPSing was done so that they have, they have, listen, we have weapon systems that people don't even know about.
[01:01:15.609 --> 01:01:15.869]  Absolutely.
[01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:16.069]  Yes, yes.
[01:01:40.026 --> 01:01:49.174]  Okay, now how do you deploy 400,000 troops when you can't get 40,000 additional troops to Afghanistan and basically supply the needs over there?
[01:01:49.634 --> 01:02:06.848]  The idea is that the, I've been told, and I've gone on record, I've been telling you this, and for those of you in the world of military and intelligence, you know this is true, that we have now close to 400,000 foreign troops at different military bases under different, quote, training programs.
[01:02:07.168 --> 01:02:08.709]  Let's not forget the first sitting president in U.S.
[01:02:08.749 --> 01:02:12.191]  history to accept the job, Barack Obama, sealing the U.N.-U.S.
[01:02:12.231 --> 01:02:14.312]  globalist takeover in this country and around the world, Steve.
[01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:37.826]  Absolutely, and for the first time in the history of the United States, the official prayer breakfast of the United States, quote, under Christians, is no longer acceptable.
[01:02:38.206 --> 01:02:50.270]  Christian imagery, Christian talk, hey, even now Christmas trees can't be called Christmas trees, and I think it's the, what, National Park Service or somebody just announced today that there'll be no quote-unquote Christmas ornaments because it's too secular.
[01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:55.611]  Get this, ladies and gentlemen, you can't talk about Jesus, but everything else goes, and I've got to share this with you.
[01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:56.812]  This is telling.
[01:02:57.532 --> 01:03:00.133]  The tree is known by the fruit it bears.
[01:03:00.573 --> 01:03:09.756]  And when every single thing is opposed to what this country was founded on and what was the presidential campaign, this is the greatest country in the world and we intend to change that.
[01:03:10.156 --> 01:03:11.777]  Ladies and gentlemen, wake up!
[01:03:11.817 --> 01:03:13.217]  You're being mind-controlled!
[01:03:13.237 --> 01:03:14.398]  You're being dumbed down!
[01:03:14.978 --> 01:03:20.621]  And that's why everyone is going to be, you know, facing massive unemployment, massive riots.
[01:03:20.861 --> 01:03:25.304]  That's why all the preposition weapons to the different gangs and the different ethnic groups.
[01:03:25.344 --> 01:03:27.645]  By the way, Jesus said nation will rise against nation.
[01:03:27.705 --> 01:03:29.206]  That word is ethnics.
[01:03:29.566 --> 01:03:32.468]  It means different people groups are going to go at war.
[01:03:32.488 --> 01:03:34.069]  This is all stir in the pot.
[01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:45.099]  And this is what's going on, and the idea is, listen, as a Montana citizen, okay, I don't give, uh, I better say this right, I don't care what the official mouthpieces for anything say.
[01:03:45.399 --> 01:04:00.033]  The fact that the guys that are going to kill me and my fellow statesmen who happen to believe in states' rights over the constitutional authority, or forgive me, the unconstitutional authority of the state, or of the federal government over state government, we're saying, hey,
[01:04:00.533 --> 01:04:01.134]  Guess what?
[01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:02.434]  We live in Montana.
[01:04:02.535 --> 01:04:03.535]  We know what's going on.
[01:04:03.775 --> 01:04:08.719]  We're the ones running into the Tazi troops on BMW motorcycles.
[01:04:08.779 --> 01:04:15.403]  We're the ones seeing and getting the reports from the 7,000 people that have been brought in to secure the border.
[01:04:15.443 --> 01:04:18.105]  Now, again, Jason, that's a huge story.
[01:04:18.505 --> 01:04:23.489]  Even as we speak, jets come in from the leading mercenary organization of the world,
[01:04:23.909 --> 01:04:31.613]  And they take foreign troops up and train them in the area that they're going to secure, and then they take them back to whatever military bases that they're bivouacked at.
[01:04:31.973 --> 01:04:41.017]  And at some point, and it appears that point is near, I do not know the day or hour, but I can tell you this, with everything that's going on, we're getting closer and closer and closer.
[01:04:41.037 --> 01:04:46.660]  You sense it, Alex senses it, and now we've gone from the word sense to absolutely seeing it.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:47.741]  We're good to go.
[01:05:09.381 --> 01:05:11.523]  The Defense Logistics Service, Inc.?
[01:05:11.763 --> 01:05:13.525]  That's another possible corporate entity?
[01:05:13.845 --> 01:05:17.968]  One guy that poo-pooed me yesterday, Jason, just found out that, hey, guess what?
[01:05:18.009 --> 01:05:23.793]  The address that they're registered to is a medical marijuana depository.
[01:05:24.334 --> 01:05:27.357]  Does that maybe tell you that maybe everything's not on the up-and-up?
[01:05:27.417 --> 01:05:28.858]  Or basically, how about this?
[01:05:29.218 --> 01:05:31.560]  One toke over the line, sweet New World Order.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.703]  You know, the bottom line is that nothing stacks up.
[01:05:35.243 --> 01:05:48.170]  If you and I were basic rookie cops or rookie detectives, when we follow all the leads of all the evidence and we get rid of all the fake and all we're left with is the root, that's what we're following.
[01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:54.314]  And when you follow the money, you come to the same conclusion that Alex, you, and I, and others have warned about.
[01:05:54.714 --> 01:06:05.183]  This is absolutely the systematic preparatory phase for the implementation of martial law using foreign mercenary troops who will kill their pre-assigned targets.
[01:06:05.503 --> 01:06:11.268]  And ladies and gentlemen, if the public knows that Obama has this hit list, George Bush and Cheney had their hit list,
[01:06:11.628 --> 01:06:15.212]  Clinton had his hit list, now they're bringing Clinton in to help Obama with his hit list.
[01:06:15.533 --> 01:06:22.080]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's way beyond, quote, a vast right-wing conspiracy or even a left-wing conspiracy.
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:32.672]  This is Luciferian, it's evil, and if we don't stop, and we won't be able to stop it, Jason, but we can help people, by the grace of God, to save as many lives as possible.
[01:06:32.932 --> 01:06:37.115]  The best defense is, number one, acknowledging that this stuff does not add up.
[01:06:37.215 --> 01:06:38.435]  I tell people to pray about it.
[01:06:38.515 --> 01:06:39.916]  I tell people to do their own homework.
[01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:52.784]  But they can't deny that all roads lead to a very wealthy and powerful group of individuals that are systematically going to balkanize the United States.
[01:06:53.144 --> 01:06:56.386]  And prior to the official balkanization, they're going to rape, pillage, and plunder.
[01:06:56.806 --> 01:06:58.547]  And again, it's going under.
[01:06:58.587 --> 01:07:00.889]  And I'm sorry, but that's as blunt as I know how to be.
[01:07:01.499 --> 01:07:16.439]  And you know, Bill Clinton plays into this left-right paradigm on purpose, knowing he works for the globalists, knowing he wants a position at the UN with him and his wife, and his wife just mused how it was great to be president of the UN for a couple of days.
[01:07:16.619 --> 01:07:16.960]  No, we're good.
[01:07:31.701 --> 01:07:32.622]  Left and right.
[01:07:32.822 --> 01:07:34.163]  Conservative and liberal.
[01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:35.945]  This is about humanity.
[01:07:36.025 --> 01:07:38.607]  This is about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:44.672]  This is about fighting an upcoming police state that we see ever encroaching right in front of our faces.
[01:07:44.913 --> 01:07:48.716]  And now with this in Montana, it has never been this bad, Steve.
[01:07:49.238 --> 01:07:53.343]  It has not, and this is like Alex, and God bless him and he keyed in on it.
[01:07:53.964 --> 01:08:00.011]  This is, if you will, this is the igniter key that people have got to recognize.
[01:08:00.051 --> 01:08:01.973]  They can say, well I just hear that as internet rumor.
[01:08:02.274 --> 01:08:03.275]  I just hear it as this or that.
[01:08:03.315 --> 01:08:05.517]  Listen, I never got the answer to my question.
[01:08:05.698 --> 01:08:08.281]  Why was no protest made over police decals?
[01:08:08.821 --> 01:08:10.542]  Becky said not for official purposes.
[01:08:10.842 --> 01:08:11.643]  I can tell you this.
[01:08:12.023 --> 01:08:15.365]  I have enough photos to prove that that is not true.
[01:08:15.645 --> 01:08:17.106]  But it was never put on their cars.
[01:08:17.446 --> 01:08:19.607]  And again, why did no one question?
[01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:20.388]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[01:08:20.648 --> 01:08:26.191]  Because people that were in a position of authority were hired by APF.
[01:08:26.591 --> 01:08:26.832]  I think so.
[01:08:42.046 --> 01:08:44.969]  As blatantly in our face as it can be.
[01:08:45.289 --> 01:08:51.754]  And those of you who think, well, this doesn't bother me because it's in Hardin, Montana, you don't know what's going on in your own city in some closed-out warehouse.
[01:08:52.135 --> 01:08:57.899]  And when the go signal is given, they plan to come down on a full-fledged hammer.
[01:08:57.919 --> 01:09:08.989]  I want to say, I don't know how much longer I have, but in closing, those of you in law enforcement, even in Hardin, Montana, whether you're tribal, whether you're community, whether you're county,
[01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:32.417]  Those of you who are being bought off at this point, you will be blown off at a later date, because with all of the foreign observers slash military personnel being placed in the police departments throughout the country, their number one duty is to make sure that the underlings follow the orders, and then once their orders are fulfilled, they are the ones that will opt
[01:09:32.777 --> 01:09:33.018]  I think so.
[01:09:48.081 --> 01:09:54.988]  History now is irrelevant because the only thing that matters to the American public is their daily dose of mindless entertainment.
[01:09:55.328 --> 01:10:05.958]  And they don't recognize, and I've said this, that when the parachuters are coming out of the sky and the roads are blocked off, this isn't the time to go up and say, gee, is this a movie and can I get a few bucks for being an extra?
[01:10:06.338 --> 01:10:08.940]  That's the concept that we're fighting in America.
[01:10:09.221 --> 01:10:13.645]  We are fighting a mind-controlled, media-manipulated,
[01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:29.114]  A group of individuals that basically cannot see and will maybe not see until it's too late, and that's why we strive, we do everything we can to inform, inform, inform, because the best antidote for fear is the truth, and that's what we're about.
[01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:39.811]  And if you don't think we can succumb to mind control, folks, you know, you just mentioned Red China and Mao and the unbelievable atrocities and genocide that occurred there.
[01:10:39.891 --> 01:10:43.734]  But just today, China communists marked 60 years in power with parade.
[01:10:44.094 --> 01:10:49.337]  Over 80,000 children in Tiananmen Square spelled out Chinese character for national celebration.
[01:10:49.637 --> 01:10:50.378]  We're good to go.
[01:11:19.557 --> 01:11:19.797]  No.
[01:11:20.178 --> 01:11:30.107]  They just can't get past the fact that they live under a communist, oppressive regime, and we're moving closer and closer to that regime as we speak.
[01:11:30.187 --> 01:11:32.009]  Any final thoughts, Steve, in the last 20 seconds?
[01:11:32.329 --> 01:11:40.737]  Well, last 20 seconds, ladies and gentlemen, as I said, if you will do your homework and follow the leads that are posted on Infowars.com, go and read the Billings Gazette article.
[01:11:40.777 --> 01:11:44.000]  It's the news alert of my day on my website, speakwhale.com.
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.384]  And then listen to Alex's compilation because he's there, boots on the ground.
[01:11:48.464 --> 01:11:49.485]  And God bless you, Jason.
[01:11:49.525 --> 01:11:50.986]  Thanks for what you did at the G20.
[01:11:51.346 --> 01:11:53.648]  And ladies and gentlemen, pray for Alex and everyone.
[01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:54.089]  Thank you.
[01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.030]  We'll be back after this.
[01:11:55.090 --> 01:11:56.051]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:11:56.837 --> 01:12:01.619]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[01:12:01.999 --> 01:12:02.399]  I'm not.
[01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:03.179]  Don't trust it.
[01:12:03.259 --> 01:12:05.140]  But then I don't want to get the disease either.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:10.922]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[01:12:11.222 --> 01:12:13.663]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[01:12:13.783 --> 01:12:17.844]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[01:12:18.324 --> 01:12:21.045]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[01:12:21.485 --> 01:12:26.932]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[01:12:27.232 --> 01:12:29.134]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:12:29.475 --> 01:12:37.784]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[01:12:38.045 --> 01:12:39.046]  Don't pick your nose.
[01:12:39.406 --> 01:12:43.687]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[01:12:43.987 --> 01:12:45.308]  Do try PureWorks.
[01:12:45.468 --> 01:12:48.889]  Available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[01:12:49.089 --> 01:12:50.790]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:52.550]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:54.551]  Be well and stay well.
[01:12:54.791 --> 01:12:55.751]  Best MZ.
[01:12:56.551 --> 01:13:02.013]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:13:02.293 --> 01:13:03.594]  And we knew what to do.
[01:13:03.614 --> 01:13:05.354]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:13:05.594 --> 01:13:07.495]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film.
[01:13:08.424 --> 01:13:08.765]  We're good.
[01:13:20.043 --> 01:13:21.183]  We're safe to breathe.
[01:13:21.523 --> 01:13:28.325]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:31.686]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:13:31.786 --> 01:13:37.028]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:13:37.568 --> 01:13:40.188]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:46.490]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:48.691]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:13:49.608 --> 01:13:54.612]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:13:57.655 --> 01:13:58.816]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:13:59.216 --> 01:14:04.701]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:14:05.282 --> 01:14:05.782]  That's right.
[01:14:06.102 --> 01:14:08.384]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:15.871]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:14:16.411 --> 01:14:24.099]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:29.405]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:14:30.045 --> 01:14:33.068]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:35.831 --> 01:14:39.954]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:14:40.354 --> 01:14:40.634]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:40.654 --> 01:14:41.595]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:14:41.615 --> 01:14:41.755]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:14:41.775 --> 01:14:41.975]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:41.995 --> 01:14:44.717]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:15:00.816 --> 01:15:01.197]  We're good to go.
[01:15:17.756 --> 01:15:18.176]  We're good.
[01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:48.501]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:15:48.521 --> 01:15:49.183]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:08.470]  We are back.
[01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:09.390]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:29.075]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in as Alex Jones has boots on the ground in Hardin, Montana at the FEMA camp at the privatized military mercenary training center that doesn't exist according to the majority of the mainstream media and talking heads out there, the people that don't want to report the truth to you.
[01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:33.599]  I gotta thank one of the sponsors, and then we're gonna go to some of the news that I haven't hit up.
[01:16:33.639 --> 01:16:37.963]  Just a huge stack of news I have not been able to play out, and it is unbelievable.
[01:16:37.983 --> 01:16:41.947]  We're gonna go through that, and we're gonna go to your phone calls, and then Alex coming up at the end of the show.
[01:16:42.808 --> 01:16:45.971]  MySolarBackup.com, that's MySolarBackup.com, 877-327-0365.
[01:16:49.694 --> 01:16:51.395]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:16:51.435 --> 01:16:53.596]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms, and more.
[01:16:53.676 --> 01:16:57.538]  How about an 1800 watt generator powered by the sun?
[01:16:57.758 --> 01:17:04.101]  You can get that and much, much more over at mysolarbackup.com.
[01:17:04.121 --> 01:17:04.501]  877-327-0365.
[01:17:05.522 --> 01:17:17.188]  Obviously, this is the most important story of the day, but we do have to hit on some of these mandatory vaccination stories because apparently there aren't mandatory vaccinations if you believe Lord Obama.
[01:17:18.249 --> 01:17:19.190]  You look at this right here.
[01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:20.552]  It's off of CBS News.
[01:17:20.932 --> 01:17:24.256]  Open letter to New York State over mandatory vaccination.
[01:17:24.276 --> 01:17:25.057]  That's the headline.
[01:17:25.358 --> 01:17:29.083]  You see, they are telling people you will lose your job if you don't take the shot.
[01:17:29.343 --> 01:17:30.705]  You will end your career.
[01:17:31.025 --> 01:17:32.066]  Take the squalene.
[01:17:32.327 --> 01:17:33.508]  Take the formaldehyde.
[01:17:33.789 --> 01:17:34.930]  Take the mercury.
[01:17:35.891 --> 01:17:39.234]  Meanwhile, you know, we talked a little bit about the police state control grid.
[01:17:39.254 --> 01:17:52.685]  I wanted to play you a video of the upcoming Google Earth and the demonstrations on how it is going to triangulate where you go to and then use CCTV cameras to show you live video images.
[01:17:52.986 --> 01:17:55.408]  This is what's available to the public, folks.
[01:17:55.888 --> 01:17:56.529]  To the public.
[01:17:56.909 --> 01:17:57.349]  Doubt me.
[01:17:57.730 --> 01:18:01.353]  I don't think we're going to have time to play it on this show, but perhaps we'll play it tomorrow.
[01:18:02.134 --> 01:18:05.297]  We only have about 34 minutes and there's so much breaking news going on.
[01:18:05.317 --> 01:18:08.900]  We're going to post it over at PrisonPlanet and InfoWars.com.
[01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:10.642]  But that ties into this story.
[01:18:11.122 --> 01:18:14.446]  EU launches free satellite system to fine-tune GPS.
[01:18:14.466 --> 01:18:15.707]  Remember, they're always here to help.
[01:18:16.087 --> 01:18:18.248]  They're always here because they love you.
[01:18:18.529 --> 01:18:19.589]  No, they're not here to help.
[01:18:19.809 --> 01:18:21.190]  They're not here because they love you.
[01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:25.253]  They're here to surveil you, to put you in the control grid.
[01:18:25.453 --> 01:18:34.359]  The European Union launched a free satellite navigation network on Thursday that could help pilots, drivers, and blind people by fine-tuning the accuracy of the U.S.
[01:18:34.379 --> 01:18:37.581]  global positioning system to around 2 meters.
[01:18:37.981 --> 01:18:39.782]  They are closing in!
[01:18:39.802 --> 01:18:41.383]  That's what this is about.
[01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:43.865]  Meanwhile, the push for a carbon tax
[01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:47.054]  And climate sustainability moves on.
[01:18:47.374 --> 01:18:48.616]  Salon.com.
[01:18:48.656 --> 01:18:49.517]  What's the headline?
[01:18:49.838 --> 01:18:52.162]  Contraception fights global warming.
[01:18:52.402 --> 01:18:54.445]  This is about a one-child policy.
[01:18:54.666 --> 01:18:58.412]  This is about demonizing you for having more children.
[01:18:59.329 --> 01:19:02.632]  They're saying your carbon footprint is killing the environment.
[01:19:02.692 --> 01:19:03.472]  No, it's not.
[01:19:04.053 --> 01:19:05.133]  It's a total lie.
[01:19:05.454 --> 01:19:11.418]  Meanwhile, they've had a thousand mayors sign on to the Climate Protection Pledge.
[01:19:11.638 --> 01:19:13.660]  A lot of well-meaning idiots out there, folks.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:20.125]  And I was sitting there watching Barbara Boxer grandstand yesterday on C-SPAN as I threw up in my own mouth.
[01:19:20.425 --> 01:19:21.707]  September 30, 2009, U.S.
[01:19:22.287 --> 01:19:30.856]  Conference of Mayors President Seattle Mayor Greg Nichols says that by Friday, a thousand mayors representing 85 million Americans will have signed the U.S.
[01:19:30.916 --> 01:19:35.521]  Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement since it was introduced in February of 2005.
[01:19:36.062 --> 01:19:38.845]  The announcement of a thousandth mayoral signatory
[01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:44.028]  And his or her city will take place during the conference leadership meeting.
[01:19:44.368 --> 01:19:47.830]  This is about a push to tax you for breathing.
[01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:51.592]  This is about a push to tax you for having more than one car.
[01:19:51.893 --> 01:19:55.455]  This is about a push to tax you for having a large home.
[01:19:56.235 --> 01:19:57.396]  Total enslavement.
[01:19:57.956 --> 01:19:59.097]  And they're getting ready, folks.
[01:19:59.137 --> 01:20:06.042]  They're going into the poor areas, they're making FEMA camps, and they're bringing in private mercenary forces!
[01:20:06.602 --> 01:20:12.226]  The reason I'm yelling is because it is crazy to me that no one is standing up to this!
[01:20:13.427 --> 01:20:14.348]  It's insanity!
[01:20:14.848 --> 01:20:15.629]  It's madness!
[01:20:16.792 --> 01:20:25.216]  And meanwhile, they have this well-meaning idiot, this nice PR lady, Becky Shea, who just got the biggest paycheck of her life, and is defending it.
[01:20:25.496 --> 01:20:38.322]  Meanwhile, it's run by a multiple convicted felon, who uses over a dozen aliases, and currently has a million dollar lawsuit, in which he lost, pending against him.
[01:20:38.622 --> 01:20:44.745]  That's not Jason Bermas, that's the Billings Gazette, that's the Associated Press, that's USA Today.
[01:20:45.589 --> 01:20:47.149]  But you'll just tell me it doesn't exist.
[01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:50.730]  You'll laugh in my face as they point the weapons at you.
[01:20:51.211 --> 01:20:54.411]  While they speak a foreign language and tell you to comply.
[01:20:54.832 --> 01:21:00.393]  While you're on your knees with your hands on your head waiting for instructions, you'll say it doesn't exist.
[01:21:00.613 --> 01:21:10.596]  While they're taking your home, while they have your daughter or wife in the other room having their way with her as she screams for help and you can't do anything because you're a yellow-bellied coward!
[01:21:11.932 --> 01:21:12.953]  That's what's going down.
[01:21:13.813 --> 01:21:22.158]  And Alex Jones is on the ground right now, risking his well-being, risking his staff to bring this news to you because it is that important.
[01:21:23.259 --> 01:21:24.700]  It might be the story of the year.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.661]  Meanwhile, mandatory vaccinations go on.
[01:21:27.701 --> 01:21:29.763]  They're telling the military, you have to take the shot.
[01:21:29.803 --> 01:21:31.704]  By the way, you're going to take an anthrax shot too.
[01:21:31.744 --> 01:21:32.504]  How do you like that?
[01:21:32.524 --> 01:21:34.325]  We're going to take your calls after this.
[01:21:34.425 --> 01:21:35.466]  Alex Jones coming up.
[01:21:36.487 --> 01:21:40.209]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, Jason Burmas subbing in for Alex.
[01:21:46.283 --> 01:21:49.268]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:21:49.288 --> 01:21:52.913]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:55.845 --> 01:21:59.826]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:22:00.086 --> 01:22:01.866]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:22:02.086 --> 01:22:10.368]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:22:10.608 --> 01:22:15.830]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:17.770]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:24.356]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:22:24.536 --> 01:22:35.286]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:22:35.586 --> 01:22:36.106]  That's right.
[01:22:36.367 --> 01:22:38.669]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:22:38.929 --> 01:22:40.711]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-HELP.
[01:22:42.432 --> 01:22:43.072]  We're good to go.
[01:22:59.392 --> 01:22:59.832]  It's here!
[01:23:00.033 --> 01:23:04.816]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:23:05.196 --> 01:23:12.841]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:20.567]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:23:20.967 --> 01:23:27.812]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:23:28.354 --> 01:23:32.436]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:23:32.696 --> 01:23:36.237]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:23:36.657 --> 01:23:38.618]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:23:38.918 --> 01:23:42.839]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:23:56.092 --> 01:24:01.420]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[01:24:01.981 --> 01:24:06.608]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:07.729]  That was then.
[01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:08.971]  This is now.
[01:24:09.612 --> 01:24:11.815]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[01:24:12.316 --> 01:24:17.980]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:27.225]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[01:24:27.605 --> 01:24:30.407]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[01:24:31.067 --> 01:24:34.950]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:36.571]  Video never lies.
[01:24:37.052 --> 01:24:38.213]  Watch Big Brother back.
[01:24:38.714 --> 01:24:40.155]  Visit diginet.net.
[01:24:40.496 --> 01:24:43.018]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:24:43.479 --> 01:24:45.681]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[01:24:46.082 --> 01:24:47.223]  Diginet dot net.
[01:24:47.764 --> 01:24:48.224]  Or call 1-888-344-6681.
[01:24:48.244 --> 01:24:48.464]  1-888-344-6681 today.
[01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:10.572]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:13.474]  Run on for a long time.
[01:25:14.095 --> 01:25:16.316]  Run on for a long time.
[01:25:16.917 --> 01:25:19.459]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:25:19.939 --> 01:25:22.461]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:25:22.822 --> 01:25:28.927]  Gore Vidal will have a dictatorship soon in the United States and he doesn't know how right he is.
[01:25:28.947 --> 01:25:31.809]  This is the Times Online out of the UK.
[01:25:33.090 --> 01:25:37.872]  Just an extensive article about how he too was duped by Obama and he thought that change was coming.
[01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:42.854]  Well the change is here and it's not what anybody expected and he's calling it like he sees it.
[01:25:42.874 --> 01:25:50.937]  We'll have a dictatorship soon in the United States and one of those steps is having privatized mercenary and military forces on the streets.
[01:25:51.798 --> 01:25:54.879]  And it's happening in Hardin, Montana as we speak.
[01:25:54.899 --> 01:25:56.280]  We're going to open the phone lines up.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.060]  Matt in Montana.
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:25:58.761]  Matt, you're on the line.
[01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:00.621]  Yes sir.
[01:26:01.522 --> 01:26:02.042]  How's it going?
[01:26:03.177 --> 01:26:04.618]  It's rough today, I'm not going to lie.
[01:26:04.658 --> 01:26:07.040]  This is a tough story to deal with because it is reality.
[01:26:07.861 --> 01:26:15.027]  I got to tell you, me and a friend investigated the scene yesterday before Alex got there.
[01:26:15.068 --> 01:26:20.152]  I was trying to get ahold of you guys, but it's really hard to get ahold of you.
[01:26:20.893 --> 01:26:25.016]  We got in and we interviewed Becky Shea.
[01:26:25.036 --> 01:26:30.181]  I got a lot of great footage of every spot, every room.
[01:26:31.155 --> 01:26:40.202]  A lot of good stuff like that, but we were there for a few hours and we did not see... I'm just really nervous, sorry.
[01:26:40.602 --> 01:26:41.063]  That's okay.
[01:26:43.004 --> 01:26:47.848]  We didn't see any Black Hawk helicopters or any paramilitary forces around.
[01:26:47.968 --> 01:26:54.973]  The only thing we saw was her SUV just come up right to us as we got into the parking lot.
[01:26:55.434 --> 01:26:58.116]  They didn't have the decals on at that point or had they taken them off?
[01:27:00.416 --> 01:27:00.936]  I don't know.
[01:27:19.309 --> 01:27:20.950]  It looks like you're media, so come on in.
[01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:24.552]  Well, I mean, she's a well-meaning person who's been thrust into this position.
[01:27:24.592 --> 01:27:27.714]  She probably didn't think it was going to be such a media storm so quickly.
[01:27:27.974 --> 01:27:35.139]  But let's just look at the American police force decals that were on there and how Orwellian and what they represent.
[01:27:35.379 --> 01:27:37.300]  First of all, they're not Americans, okay?
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.102]  This guy, Michael Hilton, not an American.
[01:27:39.362 --> 01:27:45.566]  He's a convicted felon with numerous aliases with ties to foreign government and mercenary agencies.
[01:27:45.786 --> 01:27:47.467]  Number two, they're not a police force.
[01:27:47.907 --> 01:27:51.028]  They admittedly cannot police the public there.
[01:27:51.328 --> 01:27:52.528]  So what is going on?
[01:27:52.568 --> 01:27:54.229]  They're prepping the American public.
[01:27:54.489 --> 01:28:00.050]  Again, just because there weren't troops there yesterday, or perhaps today, doesn't mean they're not, you know, going to bring them in.
[01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:04.411]  I mean, if you read the Associated Press stories, she says, yes, this will be a training facility.
[01:28:04.952 --> 01:28:10.053]  The only thing that she's denying is that it will be used as a Gitmo-type detention center.
[01:28:10.073 --> 01:28:14.114]  So she's saying that all the prisoners that are going to be held here will be domestic.
[01:28:14.354 --> 01:28:15.815]  In other words, from the United States.
[01:28:15.855 --> 01:28:17.135]  But they don't necessarily have to be
[01:28:17.555 --> 01:28:18.396]  Thank you for having me on.
[01:28:43.055 --> 01:28:45.076]  I spoke to Blackwater directly today.
[01:28:45.196 --> 01:28:52.758]  I wanted to point out that earlier today, the gentleman you thought spoke to Blackwater actually had corrected himself and said he spoke to APF.
[01:28:53.238 --> 01:28:54.558]  I called Blackwater myself.
[01:28:54.998 --> 01:28:56.859]  They adamantly deny this.
[01:28:58.539 --> 01:29:08.122]  Basically what they said is, the lady who answered the phone, as soon as I brought up APF in Montana, she transferred me to a lady who would not identify herself.
[01:29:09.382 --> 01:29:11.943]  Wanted to know who I was, what organization I was with.
[01:29:12.881 --> 01:29:25.170]  What part of the country I was from and said that APF is illegally using Blackwater insignias and symbols and they're thinking about taking action against them.
[01:29:25.591 --> 01:29:36.159]  So wait a minute, what you're telling me is that Blackwater is saying that APF is illegally using their logos and insignias and they're trying to distance themselves from this organization?
[01:29:37.045 --> 01:29:40.327]  That is what they told me, and I want to urge people to call 252-435-2488.
[01:29:41.848 --> 01:29:44.409]  That is the direct number to U.S.
[01:29:44.449 --> 01:29:52.533]  Training Center, which is the place in North Carolina that you guys have posted in some of your articles.
[01:29:53.193 --> 01:30:05.480]  And they won't identify who they are or who you're speaking with, and they'll ask a lot of questions of you, but they will... I just encourage everyone to call there and ask questions and to find out what is really going on here.
[01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:06.491]  Absolutely.
[01:30:06.531 --> 01:30:07.772]  Thank you so much for the call, Paul.
[01:30:07.792 --> 01:30:08.993]  Let's go to Karen in Oregon.
[01:30:09.033 --> 01:30:10.014]  Karen, you're on the line.
[01:30:11.815 --> 01:30:12.296]  Yes, Karen.
[01:30:13.257 --> 01:30:13.957]  Hello, Jason.
[01:30:14.998 --> 01:30:15.158]  What?
[01:30:15.719 --> 01:30:16.259]  Can you hear me?
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:16.640]  Yes.
[01:30:17.569 --> 01:30:25.251]  What I am advocating and what my people are advocating is a national strike on the 15th of October.
[01:30:25.791 --> 01:30:29.732]  We've had way too many reasons to take this strike.
[01:30:29.812 --> 01:30:32.953]  Gandhi says we need three things for a successful revolution.
[01:30:33.393 --> 01:30:37.154]  We need to be proactive, non-violent, and massive in numbers.
[01:30:37.755 --> 01:30:39.155]  We're asking people to prepare themselves
[01:30:40.947 --> 01:30:41.287]  I don't know.
[01:31:11.337 --> 01:31:12.398]  We're good to go.
[01:31:25.911 --> 01:31:29.574]  We are supporting this corrupt government gone wild.
[01:31:29.614 --> 01:31:43.884]  We're basically going along to get along when we do these things and we don't take action and you know we're willing to take a check and say yeah I'll be your PR spokeswoman or we're willing to allow this prison system to occur because yeah we're economically destitute.
[01:31:43.944 --> 01:31:45.025]  Please go check that out.
[01:31:45.265 --> 01:31:47.307]  I encourage people to take action and she's right.
[01:31:47.667 --> 01:31:50.209]  Gandhi had the correct idea.
[01:31:50.249 --> 01:31:51.410]  We need to peaceably
[01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:56.331]  Resist in large numbers and make people aware of what's truly going on.
[01:31:56.551 --> 01:31:57.871]  Kathy in New Orleans.
[01:31:57.911 --> 01:31:58.831]  Kathy, you're on the line.
[01:32:00.472 --> 01:32:00.972]  Yes, Kathy.
[01:32:03.152 --> 01:32:03.552]  Hello?
[01:32:03.792 --> 01:32:04.013]  Yes.
[01:32:05.433 --> 01:32:11.454]  Jason, this is Kathy from New Orleans, and I'm sorry, I'm actually speaking to a minister right now.
[01:32:11.474 --> 01:32:12.674]  I had to excuse myself.
[01:32:13.494 --> 01:32:20.716]  I'm with Gary King with Patriot Radio in New Orleans, and we get to talk to Dr. Ray Malabo every single week.
[01:32:21.648 --> 01:32:31.274]  And she, we spoke to her a couple days ago and today it's going, they're trying to have a lawsuit with the FDA.
[01:32:31.294 --> 01:32:38.438]  Well you know what, these lawsuits, and I thank you for the call Kathy, in my mind they don't go anywhere.
[01:32:38.738 --> 01:32:43.881]  Alright, they don't even make people that aware other than within the Patriot Network that already knows what's going on.
[01:32:43.921 --> 01:32:50.585]  I'm not saying don't try, don't try to get your message out there, don't try to take legal action, but we know about the mandatory vaccinations.
[01:32:50.825 --> 01:32:58.647]  We know the entire military, including the National Guard and Department of Defense personnel, are being forced to take the inoculation.
[01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:11.231]  We know they are telling students that if they don't take the inoculation and are absent for 10 days, which will be unexcused, they will become truant, they will have to redo that grade, and in many cases, CPS will come after your kids.
[01:33:11.451 --> 01:33:13.751]  We are living under a nightmare scenario.
[01:33:14.011 --> 01:33:16.132]  Let's go to Michael in Massachusetts.
[01:33:16.212 --> 01:33:17.072]  Michael, you're on the line.
[01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:19.193]  Jason, what's up, brother?
[01:33:19.533 --> 01:33:20.053]  How you doing, sir?
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.761]  All this stuff, it's like right out of Jericho, isn't it?
[01:33:22.781 --> 01:33:23.721]  Do you see that show?
[01:33:24.202 --> 01:33:31.545]  I watched the entire thing until they cut it off abruptly during the second season where they had to wrap everything up in a nice bow in about an hour and a half.
[01:33:32.165 --> 01:33:38.668]  Seriously, but this is like an opportunity, I mean like imagine, like we're getting at, what was it, Ravenclaw or something like that?
[01:33:40.054 --> 01:33:44.538]  Ravenwood was the private security force that they used there.
[01:33:44.838 --> 01:33:47.340]  Only they made people clamor for the inoculations.
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:48.801]  The inoculations weren't bad.
[01:33:49.101 --> 01:33:56.826]  Ravenwood, which is a Blackwater parody, was protecting the inoculations and the people had to fight to get their inoculations.
[01:33:56.866 --> 01:34:03.351]  So even in a show that exposed a lot of the quote-unquote NWO agenda, there was propaganda lying throughout.
[01:34:03.991 --> 01:34:06.293]  Hey, have you guys talked to Jeremy Scahill yet?
[01:34:07.013 --> 01:34:07.814]  I'm not sure who that is.
[01:34:08.527 --> 01:34:13.954]  Jeremy Scahill is kind of like the authority on all things Blackwater.
[01:34:13.994 --> 01:34:16.417]  He was a contributor to that Democracy Now!
[01:34:16.497 --> 01:34:26.129]  show a lot, and keeping in the philosophy of Webster Topley and attacking from the left, I think it might be a great idea if you get to get Jeremy Scahill on it.
[01:34:26.289 --> 01:34:27.451]  Infowars has posted
[01:34:28.166 --> 01:34:34.150]  A number of his articles and he appears to be a very independent person and knows everything.
[01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:48.679]  Well my producers are telling me that he they've tried several times to get him on the program but so far he's been uninterested and unfortunately people who are stuck in that left-right paradigm often don't want to come on the program don't want to discuss things that they would discuss on say a democracy now
[01:34:48.959 --> 01:34:50.819]  Which I think is a great news outlet.
[01:34:50.839 --> 01:34:56.201]  You know, 90% of the stuff that comes out there is great and we do cover here at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:56.221 --> 01:34:58.301]  So if we can get them, we will definitely try.
[01:34:58.581 --> 01:34:59.542]  I thank you for the call.
[01:34:59.802 --> 01:35:01.522]  Let's go to Steven in Texas.
[01:35:01.562 --> 01:35:02.302]  Steven, you're online.
[01:35:03.183 --> 01:35:04.083]  Yeah, hey Jason.
[01:35:04.523 --> 01:35:12.585]  First of all, I wanted to say I was praying for you and I'm so glad that you made it safely out of the illegal gathering zone in Pittsburgh.
[01:35:13.954 --> 01:35:15.235]  That was pretty scary.
[01:35:15.355 --> 01:35:19.436]  I watched with horror all the video from that, but it doesn't surprise me.
[01:35:21.336 --> 01:35:22.617]  I wanted to say a couple things.
[01:35:22.677 --> 01:35:25.437]  First of all, I just talked to a good friend of mine last night.
[01:35:25.457 --> 01:35:29.078]  I want to comment on this Montana situation because I actually called out there.
[01:35:29.098 --> 01:35:35.420]  I wasn't able to go, but I talked to a good friend of mine last night here, and he was having some problems with his electric.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:41.102]  So he contacted the electric company, Entergy, and they finally got his electric on.
[01:35:41.142 --> 01:35:41.922]  He just bought a house.
[01:35:42.506 --> 01:35:51.889]  But they told him that they are going to be replacing the current meters they have with meters that are all GPS compatible.
[01:35:52.586 --> 01:35:53.207]  Oh, how lovely.
[01:35:53.627 --> 01:35:59.972]  They're electric, so they will be able to read the electric via GPS and not have to send people out anymore.
[01:36:00.112 --> 01:36:07.858]  Well, it is the new cashless society control grid that they're building with RFID and biometric technology as well as GPS technology.
[01:36:07.898 --> 01:36:14.803]  And like I said, what Google Earth is about to present to people, what they just showed in a demonstration this week is unbelievable.
[01:36:14.843 --> 01:36:16.685]  You'll be able to zoom in
[01:36:17.305 --> 01:36:26.774]  On a live area where we'll give you live CCTV camera footage of what's going on on that street, on that town, on that highway.
[01:36:27.034 --> 01:36:29.176]  It's simply unbelievable the times we're living in.
[01:36:29.196 --> 01:36:42.508]  I've seen the stuff they have on Google Earth, just where you can look at a neighborhood, but the day that this information about what's going on in Harrington City was posted on InfoWars, I think it was Monday,
[01:36:43.323 --> 01:36:48.044]  I immediately, I'm proactive, I called to the sheriff's office there.
[01:36:48.104 --> 01:36:49.885]  I also talked to City Hall.
[01:36:50.145 --> 01:36:51.885]  I couldn't get anyone with the council.
[01:36:52.666 --> 01:36:56.927]  And the woman with the sheriff's office told me the sheriff's not here.
[01:36:57.227 --> 01:36:59.187]  Now, whether that's true or not, I don't know.
[01:36:59.668 --> 01:37:01.088]  He was conveniently not there.
[01:37:01.148 --> 01:37:03.669]  But I brought up to her about this.
[01:37:03.849 --> 01:37:06.049]  First, when I brought it up, I called Alex the other day.
[01:37:06.489 --> 01:37:07.970]  She immediately said, well, it's fake.
[01:37:08.658 --> 01:37:09.259]  I said, what?
[01:37:09.299 --> 01:37:10.299]  She said, yeah, it's fake.
[01:37:10.359 --> 01:37:16.845]  I said, ma'am, I saw the video from the newscasters with these guys with APF coming in with Hardin City Police.
[01:37:17.805 --> 01:37:21.088]  Well, they took that off the vehicles, you know, like that made it okay.
[01:37:21.128 --> 01:37:24.651]  And I just, you know, gave her a rundown about what this is really about.
[01:37:25.331 --> 01:37:27.133]  And she thanked me, and that was the end of that.
[01:37:27.153 --> 01:37:28.654]  Well, look at the guys, Stephen.
[01:37:28.734 --> 01:37:29.735]  Stephen, look at the guys.
[01:37:29.775 --> 01:37:33.998]  They're presenting themselves not only as a police force, but an American police force.
[01:37:34.018 --> 01:37:37.001]  And then you have the crest of Serbia above it, number one.
[01:37:37.281 --> 01:37:44.987]  Number two, we know that these are foreign mercenaries, and the head of this is a convicted felon with over a dozen aliases.
[01:37:45.027 --> 01:37:46.588]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:37:46.789 --> 01:37:49.170]  This is straight out of a James Bond movie.
[01:37:49.210 --> 01:37:50.431]  It's unbelievable.
[01:37:50.471 --> 01:37:51.072]  I gotta jump.
[01:37:51.132 --> 01:37:52.313]  I thank you for the call, Stephen.
[01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:53.994]  Let's go to Kevin in New York.
[01:37:54.034 --> 01:37:54.755]  Kevin, you're on the line.
[01:37:55.506 --> 01:37:57.288]  Hey Jason, great show today.
[01:37:57.988 --> 01:38:06.396]  I just wanted to let your listeners know that a great place to start with this whole Montana incident here is the actual architectural blueprints.
[01:38:07.057 --> 01:38:10.200]  If they put up a public bond, they should be in the public domain.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:15.085]  In the bottom hand ledger, there'll be names, there'll be the engineering firm,
[01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:19.212]  It'd be a first place to pull the string in this situation.
[01:38:20.273 --> 01:38:21.714]  People have to sign this off.
[01:38:22.655 --> 01:38:34.906]  Becky Shea is sitting there saying, yes, you did see some documents where they said foreign alien detainment, but then she won't reveal who the supposed contractors were before the APF came in.
[01:38:34.986 --> 01:38:35.907]  I've got to jump, Kevin.
[01:38:36.147 --> 01:38:42.652]  I've got Alex on the line with his final intel report on the streets of Hardin, Montana.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:51.783]  Yes, the spokesperson for American Police Force, itself a cutout for another company, itself another cutout to foreign Merck firms.
[01:38:51.823 --> 01:38:52.563]  That's confirmed.
[01:38:52.943 --> 01:38:54.244]  She's now getting very agitated.
[01:38:54.264 --> 01:38:55.604]  There's a bunch of local media here.
[01:38:55.644 --> 01:38:56.925]  It's now on national news.
[01:38:57.745 --> 01:38:59.246]  And we've talked to locals.
[01:38:59.286 --> 01:39:01.427]  They were patrolling around here last week.
[01:39:01.447 --> 01:39:08.069]  That's when all this started, about a week and a half ago, when the vehicles didn't break on the news until the weekend.
[01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:09.570]  They did put decals on these black
[01:39:10.695 --> 01:39:12.976]  Mercedes SUVs, they are driving around.
[01:39:13.336 --> 01:39:16.517]  Then earlier in the week they tried to say that was a conspiracy theory and none of that was happening.
[01:39:16.557 --> 01:39:18.778]  Now they've had to admit that they were here.
[01:39:18.798 --> 01:39:21.499]  This type of stuff was going on.
[01:39:22.019 --> 01:39:27.081]  We've been getting followed by men in black sedans, also similar red trucks.
[01:39:27.521 --> 01:39:33.223]  Men in camouflage have been seen by us and by locals that are here all over the town.
[01:39:33.243 --> 01:39:36.244]  There's all sorts of weird military drills going on here.
[01:39:36.986 --> 01:39:44.692]  And, uh, again, you have Germans, you have, uh, Serbs, you have Czech Republic, uh, you have Brits, you have others here.
[01:39:44.732 --> 01:39:50.116]  They've all basically fled the facility, but they're still in the town.
[01:39:51.237 --> 01:39:58.102]  And, uh, I knew this was a big story whenever we found out that they were putting, uh, the police insignias on the side of their cars.
[01:39:58.842 --> 01:40:04.066]  What we know is happening is, is two rivers basically is an authority.
[01:40:04.784 --> 01:40:10.792]  And it's quasi-public-private group, kind of like the LCRA in Central Texas taking over the water supply, hiring our own SWAT teams.
[01:40:11.539 --> 01:40:21.822]  And what they've done is a power grab here, the other shows, and the spokesman in several newscasts earlier this week and over the weekend admitted, well, we had a wish list to have them be local police.
[01:40:22.382 --> 01:40:34.486]  So imagine this, you have a paramilitary foreign secretive group run by a 14-time felon from Serbia with his bizarre father in tow with German troops, very serious military.
[01:40:35.406 --> 01:40:35.927]  I'm good.
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:40:58.581]  I think so.
[01:41:15.945 --> 01:41:16.385]  We're good to go.
[01:41:41.588 --> 01:41:42.149]  I don't know.
[01:41:59.842 --> 01:42:01.623]  The locals keep asking, well, why are you taking over?
[01:42:01.643 --> 01:42:03.024]  Why are you moving in foreign soldiers?
[01:42:03.384 --> 01:42:04.205]  Why are you doing all this?
[01:42:04.245 --> 01:42:05.626]  Why are you saying it's not a FEMA camp?
[01:42:05.646 --> 01:42:10.228]  See, in April, the locals said, we don't want this to be Guantanamo Bay West, as CNN called it.
[01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:14.291]  And so they said, OK, well, we're just going to put regular prisoners there, but we're not going to talk about it.
[01:42:14.691 --> 01:42:16.252]  And they keep saying everything is secret.
[01:42:16.312 --> 01:42:20.014]  So the fact that it's a secret is only making it get bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:42:20.034 --> 01:42:23.296]  But this is definitely, at bare minimum, been looked at.
[01:42:24.073 --> 01:42:27.676]  We'll be back with Alex Jones in just a minute.
[01:42:27.696 --> 01:42:29.878]  The latest over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:42:57.806 --> 01:42:59.007]  Remain in your houses.
[01:42:59.827 --> 01:43:04.992]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[01:43:05.593 --> 01:43:06.594]  Will they do it?
[01:43:06.954 --> 01:43:08.916]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[01:43:09.576 --> 01:43:15.602]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[01:43:16.042 --> 01:43:17.284]  Think it can't happen here?
[01:43:18.224 --> 01:43:21.746]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[01:43:22.487 --> 01:43:26.789]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[01:43:27.370 --> 01:43:31.652]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[01:43:32.293 --> 01:43:37.116]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[01:43:38.016 --> 01:43:46.140]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.722]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.

[01:43:56.539 --> 01:44:01.845]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:02.365 --> 01:44:09.353]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:44:09.953 --> 01:44:16.100]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:18.360]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.901]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:44:21.001 --> 01:44:31.924]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:44:32.564 --> 01:44:33.864]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:34.244 --> 01:44:35.624]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:36.105 --> 01:44:42.326]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:42.992 --> 01:44:50.757]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:51.258 --> 01:44:52.399]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:52.839 --> 01:44:54.040]  The people strike back!
[01:44:56.178 --> 01:45:06.790]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[01:45:07.090 --> 01:45:11.015]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[01:45:11.275 --> 01:45:13.017]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[01:45:13.397 --> 01:45:18.940]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:28.805]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[01:45:29.065 --> 01:45:35.328]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[01:45:35.548 --> 01:45:38.870]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[01:45:38.890 --> 01:45:40.731]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:45:40.971 --> 01:45:42.172]  It simply needs some help.
[01:45:42.372 --> 01:45:42.852]  So it has
[01:45:44.074 --> 01:45:46.238]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[01:45:59.332 --> 01:46:01.353]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:01.393 --> 01:46:03.675]  The enemy continues to attack.
[01:46:04.055 --> 01:46:08.338]  This is off the TwoRiversAuthority.org website.
[01:46:08.378 --> 01:46:09.579]  Let me read it right here.
[01:46:09.619 --> 01:46:12.901]  It's right here for PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers.
[01:46:13.001 --> 01:46:19.906]  The stories by Steve Quayle and Alex Jones in regards to Hardin TRA and Detention Center are not true.
[01:46:20.287 --> 01:46:25.230]  We have no idea where they got this information, but there is absolutely no validity to these articles.
[01:46:25.450 --> 01:46:27.551]  There is no fencer gate being built around Hardin.
[01:46:27.752 --> 01:46:34.996]  People are not being put in jail for refusing the swine flu shot and our city is not being taken over by a private police agency.
[01:46:35.416 --> 01:46:43.902]  Yet they have American police force on the side of their cars that she admitted that they are going to be training foreign mercenaries.
[01:46:43.942 --> 01:46:49.625]  The person that they have put in charge according to the Billings Gazette and now the Associated Press and now USA Today.
[01:46:49.825 --> 01:46:51.567]  These are mainline sources folks!
[01:46:52.327 --> 01:47:10.064]  This is a multiple felon with multiple aliases who has lost civil suits in which he owes over a million dollars and he is posed as a car salesman, as an entrepreneur, as an arts dealer, as a restaurant owner, as somebody who advised on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:47:11.175 --> 01:47:15.780]  This Hilton character, or whatever his name is, is Bad News Brown.
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:18.282]  They are eviscerating the country.
[01:47:18.803 --> 01:47:25.029]  That's what this is about, and now they are attacking on the actual website of the prison.
[01:47:25.450 --> 01:47:27.952]  Remember, this prison put into place in 2007 under the Bush administration.
[01:47:30.535 --> 01:47:33.357]  And the agenda continues through the Obama administration.
[01:47:33.397 --> 01:47:40.582]  If you missed any of the program today, so much hard-hitting info, you missed any of the four hours, you need the podcast immediately.
[01:47:40.622 --> 01:47:42.403]  You need to listen to the rebroadcast.
[01:47:42.703 --> 01:48:00.135]  You need to hear out of Becky Shea's own mouth how she doesn't want to discuss who is actually running this operation, and how she refuses to discuss the people that were running the operation prior to the secret organization who's running the operation now, and how they want to make this Guantanamo West.
[01:48:01.337 --> 01:48:08.896]  She just outright denies it, but then says, oh yeah, that paperwork was there about detaining illegal aliens from, you know, foreign groups.
[01:48:10.021 --> 01:48:11.242]  What's going on here?
[01:48:11.302 --> 01:48:12.823]  We've lost the country, folks.
[01:48:12.883 --> 01:48:24.810]  We continue to lose it with every breath we take, with every denial we put out there, with all the willful ignorance and the shopping and the iPhones and, oh, the Angels are in the playoffs!
[01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.691]  Who cares?
[01:48:26.031 --> 01:48:27.692]  Who cares about sports at this point?
[01:48:28.092 --> 01:48:29.573]  This is our country we're talking about.
[01:48:29.793 --> 01:48:37.178]  If you still want to get boxed seats to that game next season, maybe you should step up to the plate and see what's going on in your own country.
[01:48:38.208 --> 01:48:42.750]  Remember the headline over at PrisonPlanet.tv right now and PrisonPlanet.com is exposed.
[01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:46.572]  American Police Force is a Black Water Front Group.
[01:48:46.892 --> 01:48:48.533]  Please get the articles.
[01:48:48.933 --> 01:48:52.155]  Circulate them to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[01:48:53.055 --> 01:48:54.076]  Save humanity.
[01:48:54.136 --> 01:48:56.497]  You have incredible power within you.
[01:48:57.017 --> 01:49:01.942]  We have so many people on the ground now in Hardin, Montana, reporting the truth.
[01:49:02.203 --> 01:49:07.328]  Michael Hollingsworth, we can't commend him enough for coming on yesterday and today.
[01:49:07.348 --> 01:49:13.014]  A man with great military experience and expertise who is looking at this and knows what it is.
[01:49:13.835 --> 01:49:16.356]  It is a foreign globalist takeover.
[01:49:16.896 --> 01:49:18.777]  It is the end of America.
[01:49:19.317 --> 01:49:22.999]  When we praise China in this country, we better look out.
[01:49:23.099 --> 01:49:23.899]  What are our morals?
[01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:24.800]  What are our values?
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:25.760]  What do we stand for?
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.221]  What do we truly believe in?
[01:49:27.841 --> 01:49:30.362]  Do we believe in standing up to tyranny?
[01:49:30.562 --> 01:49:31.643]  To speaking the truth?
[01:49:32.243 --> 01:49:37.910]  Or are we just going to regurgitate what the mainstream media and political figures tell us is happening?
[01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:41.594]  Are we going to bow down to our globalist masters?
[01:49:41.614 --> 01:49:44.677]  Or are we going to step up to the plate and say, NO!
[01:49:46.139 --> 01:49:48.922]  We still have some semblance of the First Amendment left.
[01:49:48.982 --> 01:49:50.804]  I'm going to make my voice heard!
[01:49:53.132 --> 01:49:56.374]  All this and more over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:56.414 --> 01:49:59.396]  Again, Alex Jones in Montana as we speak.
[01:49:59.416 --> 01:50:04.239]  He will be reporting live, live from Hardin, Montana tomorrow.
[01:50:04.259 --> 01:50:08.561]  Folks, now is the time to step up to the plate and swing the bat.
[01:50:09.482 --> 01:50:12.404]  It's time to say no more tyranny.
[01:50:13.905 --> 01:50:15.546]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:50:15.626 --> 01:50:18.247]  Again, get the podcast, listen to the rebroadcast.
[01:50:18.287 --> 01:50:19.648]  So much important information.
[01:50:20.168 --> 01:50:20.889]  God bless you all.
[01:50:37.406 --> 01:50:38.694]  You are listening to GCN.
