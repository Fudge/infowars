[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.010]  Punch it!
[00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:12.459]  Hey now, Hans Briggs brought us all the car!
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.561]  Hans Briggs?
[00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:15.842]  Oh no!
[00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:18.444]  Oh, hello!
[00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:19.765]  Great to see you again, Hans!
[00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:26.722]  Mr. Earle, I was supposed to be allowed to inspect your palace today, and your guards won't let me in to certain areas.
[00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:28.683]  Hans, Hans, Hans!
[00:00:28.723 --> 00:00:30.444]  We've been through this a dozen times!
[00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:34.365]  I don't have any way for you to match instruction, okay Hans?
[00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:37.507]  Then let me look around so I can ease the UN's collective mind.
[00:00:37.527 --> 00:00:40.068]  Hans, you're breaking my balls here, Hans!
[00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:41.189]  You're breaking my balls!
[00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:43.750]  I'm sorry, but the UN must be firm with you.
[00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.191]  Let me see your whole palace, or else!
[00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:48.412]  Or else what?
[00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:53.516]  Or else, we will be very, very angry with you.
[00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:57.417]  And we will write you a letter telling you how angry we are.
[00:00:58.617 --> 00:01:00.097]  Okay, I'll show you Hans.
[00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:00.858]  You ready?
[00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:02.478]  Stand ready to erect.
[00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:08.620]  Wait a moment.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.681]  Good.
[00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:18.742]  Hans Blake's on now!
[00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:22.257]  Gotta have some fun here as all this happens.
[00:01:23.118 --> 00:01:24.779]  There's Han Blix, right there.
[00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.082]  Doing quite nicely.
[00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:33.285]  But see, the government, the media can tell you, oh, those guys over there, they're evil.
[00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.587]  But our governments, they're good.
[00:01:35.607 --> 00:01:39.790]  No, they're just slicker.
[00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:44.771]  And that's what's happening.
[00:01:45.052 --> 00:01:46.632]  All right, I promise to take your phone calls.
[00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:47.393]  Cal just hung up.
[00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:51.135]  Derek, Fred, Dave, John, Leo, David, many others.
[00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:52.436]  In fact, should I go to David first?
[00:01:52.456 --> 00:01:57.759]  He's in Singapore getting reports of what could shape up to be World War III.
[00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.319]  By the way, I forgot to get to this.
[00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:03.001]  The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that there is no right to a lawyer.
[00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.382]  You can be interrogated without a lawyer.
[00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:07.124]  That's just end of the Bill of Rights.
[00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:10.506]  That's out of Reuters, by the way, and they report it like it's no big deal.
[00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:13.046]  So see, all of this is happening.
[00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:14.647]  We're going into tyranny right now.
[00:02:15.247 --> 00:02:16.807]  Jason Burmess will join us in 30 minutes.
[00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:20.288]  Let's go to David in Singapore.
[00:02:20.328 --> 00:02:21.408]  David, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:02:23.788 --> 00:02:24.828]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:25.548]  Good, sir.
[00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.290]  I don't really have any insight on anything from this part of the world I'm just passing through right now.
[00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.711]  I wanted to talk about conditioning and predictive programming and the revelation of the method
[00:02:47.134 --> 00:03:09.683]  Actually, first off, I've heard you say, I think I heard you say that although you say that you definitely were not aware of it, but do you think it's possible that they might have allowed you to somehow
[00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:23.821]  uh... get not be kicked out of bohemian grove so that you could expose that or something yes i mean i mean i mean it's possible that leprechauns are real
[00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:33.945]  You know, maybe ten thousand years ago somebody saw somebody walk up a little flying saucer that was dressed like a leprechaun and that's where the legends of leprechauns began.
[00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:43.212]  I don't speculate on space aliens and leprechauns because I can't prove one way or the other whether space aliens or leprechauns are real.
[00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:48.956]  All I know is everybody else that's gone into Bohemian Grove has been caught and been arrested.
[00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:50.897]  But of the
[00:03:52.116 --> 00:03:53.637]  It's got to be more than ten reporters.
[00:03:54.117 --> 00:03:59.239]  People Magazine, Vanity Fair, the list goes on and on, local reporters.
[00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.761]  They've all been arrested because they try to go into the meeting halls.
[00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:06.082]  It's over a hundred sub-camps.
[00:04:06.442 --> 00:04:07.662]  They're in that gorge.
[00:04:07.703 --> 00:04:09.003]  It's 2,700 acres.
[00:04:09.343 --> 00:04:11.724]  People say, well, why didn't you show the Buddha statue?
[00:04:11.924 --> 00:04:13.365]  You're covering up for the Buddhist.
[00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:15.866]  Or why didn't you show some Catholic statue?
[00:04:16.126 --> 00:04:16.646]  Because it is 2,000
[00:04:18.727 --> 00:04:27.373]  Seven hundred acres of hills and rugged hills were electric, I mean gas-powered golf carts with attendants take them up the hills.
[00:04:27.853 --> 00:04:36.539]  I was only in the gorge and then went up one hill to hide in the woods because I'd been questioned by Secret Service, questioned by Sonoma County Sheriff's deputies.
[00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:39.841]  They're the ones that arrested the Vanity Fair guy last year.
[00:04:39.861 --> 00:04:45.125]  And you know, if you read his description of what's inside, what happened to him, it's the same thing happened to me.
[00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.686]  I was just amazingly calm.
[00:04:47.226 --> 00:04:48.307]  So was Mike Hanson.
[00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:52.390]  You know, we kind of put on the Texas charm with them and like, yeah, we're just hillbillies.
[00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.531]  You know, we're here with that club from Texas.
[00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:55.132]  How you doing?
[00:04:55.952 --> 00:04:59.114]  And by the grace of God, it was all about the mission.
[00:04:59.134 --> 00:05:03.898]  You know, you get past your fear of being caught and your anxiety by the mission, by the mission.
[00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:07.518]  And we snuck in, we got out.
[00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:09.459]  I believe they didn't know we were in there.
[00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:15.884]  And I've been honest about why I believe that we were left alone.
[00:05:15.904 --> 00:05:27.972]  Because I saw employees laughing at me, and some of the sheriff's deputies were off laughing when the, who I later learned was the sheriff, came up to me and said, I saw you with a spyglass up here.
[00:05:27.992 --> 00:05:30.034]  And I said, yeah, it's in my bag, binoculars.
[00:05:30.754 --> 00:05:31.635]  It was really a camera.
[00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.096]  You see when you get shots of the river.
[00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:36.540]  I was dumb and pulled it out because they have hidden cameras.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.163]  I saw a guard shack down there with TV screens when I walked past it.
[00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:41.064]  So we were being calm.
[00:05:42.386 --> 00:05:44.488]  But later I learned more about the Grove.
[00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:46.450]  They have a lot of male prostitutes coming there.
[00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.273]  And I was 50 pounds lighter then and pretty good looking.
[00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:53.572]  Well I guess I was about 40 pounds lighter than him because I lost a lot of weight.
[00:05:53.592 --> 00:05:59.417]  But the point is that, and Mike's not a bad looking guy, and so the big joke was they thought we were the male prostitutes.
[00:05:59.977 --> 00:06:05.462]  So it's kind of an inglorious reason that we were able to infiltrate.
[00:06:06.023 --> 00:06:08.325]  We were younger and good looking.
[00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:14.589]  Most of these reporters I've seen getting arrested are older or aren't handsome.
[00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.251]  And so that was the big joke.
[00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:18.572]  I was being laughed at every time I was seen.
[00:06:18.612 --> 00:06:19.773]  It was a big joke I had.
[00:06:21.294 --> 00:06:27.159]  We went into one camp and had guys come up to us and ask us who we were with and it was kind of getting obvious and they were getting a little paranoid.
[00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:35.585]  So we left and going back in hindsight, the way these men were approaching us and talking to us, these rich CEOs, is they wanted to have a little, you know, roll in the hay.
[00:06:36.426 --> 00:06:37.446]  But that, you know, that
[00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:44.914]  You know, as they say in Spartacus, I like oysters, not snails.
[00:06:45.535 --> 00:06:46.496]  I'm not a snail eater.
[00:06:46.536 --> 00:06:47.938]  I'm not in their camp.
[00:06:48.438 --> 00:06:53.704]  So if you really want to know what was going on there, that is probably what happened.
[00:06:53.724 --> 00:06:55.286]  That's my inglorious reason.
[00:06:55.887 --> 00:06:57.428]  And plus, God is with us.
[00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:02.172]  You know, people like to joke around and say, the force is with us, but when God is with you, who can be against you?
[00:07:02.453 --> 00:07:06.616]  I believe in providence, and I did say a prayer, God, let me get in here, let me find out the truth.
[00:07:06.936 --> 00:07:10.379]  If there isn't a ritual going on, or if it isn't serious, I'll come out and report it.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.061]  And I went in and reported it.
[00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:23.210]  And so I agree with what our guest was saying yesterday about the elites rationalize to themselves that so what, it's revelation of the method, this stuff's going to come out anyway, so so what if I'm exposing it?
[00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:29.374]  But I've gotten death threats and been beat up and other things, and so I know they don't like it, you know, that much.
[00:07:29.874 --> 00:07:37.459]  But I've had more problems, say, when I'm exposing a federal judge, like Walter E. Smith, pointing out he was having a fraudulent civil trial.
[00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:43.643]  He was being basically sued for the criminal trial, and then there he was, the head of the civil trial.
[00:07:43.723 --> 00:07:44.784]  I said, what a fraud!
[00:07:44.804 --> 00:07:52.689]  You know, the Davidians were found not guilty of murder, but then they were found guilty of using weapons in the commission of a murder.
[00:07:53.772 --> 00:07:55.634]  And that was a mandatory federal sentencing.
[00:07:55.654 --> 00:07:57.255]  He put him there for 47 years apiece.
[00:07:58.636 --> 00:08:00.157]  And so I was bullhorning the judge.
[00:08:00.217 --> 00:08:01.498]  I was making a big deal in the news.
[00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.000]  And I got beat up for it pretty bad.
[00:08:05.041 --> 00:08:06.262]  And my dad told me that growing up.
[00:08:06.282 --> 00:08:07.823]  He said, you've got to watch the little thugs.
[00:08:07.843 --> 00:08:10.105]  You've got to watch the little local boss hogs.
[00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:11.606]  And that's true.
[00:08:11.646 --> 00:08:12.927]  They're the ones that are scared of you.
[00:08:13.428 --> 00:08:17.191]  See, because I can take on Hays County and probably get a lot of them in jail.
[00:08:17.491 --> 00:08:18.232]  So they're dangerous.
[00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:20.615]  I can take on Travis County and Austin.
[00:08:20.855 --> 00:08:24.039]  That's why in my own backyard I don't mess with the locals too much.
[00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:30.627]  I still expose them and things but I'm not out charging in to mess with the locals because they're the type that will give you cement shoes.
[00:08:31.328 --> 00:08:32.029]  Does that make sense?
[00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:33.751]  Right.
[00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:52.026]  Let me ask you, I heard you mention it back during the flu thing, that there was an episode of Alec Baldwin's show that came out in January entitled Flu Shot that was all about flu shots and you know, making you think you needed to get one and all this stuff.
[00:08:52.427 --> 00:09:03.495]  You recently had posted the old Archie Bunker from 72 talking about gun control and all this conditioning and predictive programming coming out in shows and movies.
[00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:08.379]  How do you think they insert so many things like that into shows?
[00:09:14.423 --> 00:09:16.264]  Without it, you know, people know.
[00:09:16.284 --> 00:09:22.889]  Well, I mean, especially back in the 70s and 80s, there might have been a hundred major or less TV producers.
[00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:28.012]  I mean, each producer would, you know, have like 20, 30 shows in their 20, 30 years in the business.
[00:09:28.493 --> 00:09:32.235]  And they had a handful of writers they use, and they have a worldview.
[00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:37.659]  And the CIA admits, going back to the 30s, when they were OSS, they were there planning stories.
[00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:42.603]  And I've had the Lone Gunman star, Dean Hagelin on, saying the CIA planted stories on them.
[00:09:43.547 --> 00:09:47.150]  Planted the fly hijack jets in the World Trade Center.
[00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.372]  Use a government drill to make NORAD stand down.
[00:09:49.612 --> 00:09:50.573]  The government's going to do it.
[00:09:50.593 --> 00:09:52.335]  They're going to use an anti-terror drill as the cover.
[00:09:52.575 --> 00:09:53.996]  That's how they really launch attacks.
[00:09:54.016 --> 00:09:55.958]  7-7, 9-11, 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
[00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:02.363]  But they don't have total control or total dominance.
[00:10:02.563 --> 00:10:03.524]  I know I'm good.
[00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.225]  I know I'm for real.
[00:10:05.585 --> 00:10:06.986]  I know I'm affecting change.
[00:10:07.346 --> 00:10:09.367]  And you know, as a lone wolf, you're good.
[00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:11.688]  And so you need to become a leader and take action.
[00:10:11.989 --> 00:10:14.970]  And in that, you know that you're having an effect.
[00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:24.036]  And then, as we wake up the elite, and as we wake up the middle class, as we wake up, and as we become the dominant force in society, we have to be ready for victory as well.
[00:10:25.056 --> 00:10:26.237]  People think we can't have victory.
[00:10:26.257 --> 00:10:28.819]  They think if we ever have success, it must be staged.
[00:10:29.259 --> 00:10:34.763]  The truth is the elite want to make you think everything's staged and we have no power, because they know how much power we really got.
[00:10:35.483 --> 00:10:37.124]  I mean, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:10:37.144 --> 00:10:39.806]  I'm not exactly sure where you're going, but it brought up some interesting points.
[00:10:40.666 --> 00:10:41.707]  Let's go to another caller here.
[00:10:41.747 --> 00:10:43.608]  Let's talk to Derek in Texas.
[00:10:43.648 --> 00:10:44.409]  Derek, you're on the air.
[00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.769]  Welcome.
[00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.110]  Hey, Alex.
[00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.530]  Thank you.
[00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.391]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:10:48.425 --> 00:10:56.871]  I'm obligated to plug northtexas911truth.com because they're having a great event and they've invited me to speak.
[00:10:56.891 --> 00:11:03.636]  I know one of the members, he knows that I'm a registered engineer and he wants me to come talk to the press.
[00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:12.157]  And answer some questions and give a presentation on what I think would be a reasonable solution to getting to the bottom of 9-11.
[00:11:12.237 --> 00:11:16.500]  Good, so you know you're a good person, so you're taking action, getting on the road.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.083]  You know, the road to victory against tyranny isn't open forever.
[00:11:20.463 --> 00:11:27.388]  Everybody's got to take that road, get off the road of slavery we're on, off the road of apathy, and get on the road of liberty and freedom.
[00:11:28.931 --> 00:11:38.455]  Yeah, exactly, and I've had other engineers call me a nutjob in the whole nine yards, and then they'll come back a year later and say, doggone it, you know, you were right, this is just too much.
[00:11:38.795 --> 00:11:41.876]  Exactly, tell me more about it on the other side, then I'm going to go to everybody else here.
[00:11:41.896 --> 00:11:44.277]  And then about 40 after, Burmese is going to pop in.
[00:11:44.577 --> 00:11:47.798]  He walked in and said, did you see the Supreme Court said no more lawyers?
[00:11:47.818 --> 00:11:52.180]  And I said, yeah, I saw that last night, it's in my stack.
[00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:54.420]  I mean, that's my point.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.500]  I've got stacks of news here.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.301]  I've got to go over it all.
[00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:58.262]  It's all just coming in too fast.
[00:11:58.822 --> 00:11:59.442]  We'll be right back.

[00:12:40.265 --> 00:12:43.986]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:13.906]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:20.631]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:22.753]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:22.913 --> 00:13:25.295]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:13:25.375 --> 00:13:36.243]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:13:38.547 --> 00:13:39.808]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:40.209 --> 00:13:41.610]  It's about a one world government.
[00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:48.418]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:54.513]  Call today!
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.720]  John, who was it I was just talking to?
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.881]  That's what I thought.
[00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:50.843]  Okay, Derek in Texas, you're going up to, as an architect or an engineer, you're going up to give a presentation.
[00:16:50.863 --> 00:16:51.763]  What else were you going to add?
[00:16:53.143 --> 00:16:59.065]  Well, just the central part of my presentation is to demand for the plans, especially WTC7.
[00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:05.466]  I know there were some early plans for WTC1 and 2 that were released, but those weren't final plans.
[00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.470]  Signed and stamped by an engineer.
[00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:12.892]  Those were preliminary plans which left a lot of critical dimensions unspecific at that time.
[00:17:13.152 --> 00:17:19.693]  Also, they're being very secretive about building 7's plans after FEMA took it over and built the command bunker within it.
[00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:22.014]  That was a spook house they blew up that day.
[00:17:23.354 --> 00:17:23.974]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:17:24.034 --> 00:17:25.915]  It was loaded with all kinds of stuff.
[00:17:25.955 --> 00:17:27.475]  Laundry list of stuff.
[00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:31.856]  Department of Defense, NSA, FBI, CIA, IRS.
[00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:32.957]  The whole thing.
[00:17:33.057 --> 00:17:34.657]  Giant spook command base.
[00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:36.626]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:38.167]  Well, let me get to this event.
[00:17:38.267 --> 00:17:39.929]  It is going to be in Plano, Texas.
[00:17:40.209 --> 00:17:45.393]  It's Saturday, July 11th, and it's going to be at a campus.
[00:17:45.413 --> 00:17:48.636]  You can get more information at northtexas911truth.com.
[00:17:48.956 --> 00:17:51.939]  I'm going to open up the point of finite element analysis.
[00:17:53.856 --> 00:18:11.406]  With the plans or without the plans, we can still recreate the situation and kind of highlight the unviability of a free-fall collapse, symmetrical, gravity-driven collapse that pulverized up and let molten metal sit for six weeks or so.
[00:18:11.426 --> 00:18:11.806]  It's ridiculous.
[00:18:11.866 --> 00:18:12.427]  Absolutely.
[00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:13.367]  I've got to jump, man.
[00:18:13.387 --> 00:18:14.448]  Good to hear from you, Derek.
[00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:16.709]  Fred in Philly, you're on the air.
[00:18:16.769 --> 00:18:17.109]  Welcome.
[00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.970]  Hi.
[00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.612]  I wanted to talk about the economic cartel.
[00:18:22.855 --> 00:18:37.527]  You have, as Kevin was mentioning, you have the agricultural cartel, you have all the other ones he mentioned, but there's a monetary cartel that has to do with the gold.
[00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:49.077]  We know that the markets are manipulated by the use of planted stories on the sentiment of the traders.
[00:18:51.018 --> 00:18:51.839]  People are told
[00:18:52.304 --> 00:19:00.347]  That there is no reason for panic in a particular event and therefore the price of gold may drift downward.
[00:19:04.008 --> 00:19:19.053]  If no one is participating in these markets except a few powerful people, then that allows for the social psychology to come in and that, in addition to the selling of gold, suppresses the price of gold.
[00:19:19.813 --> 00:19:21.594]  So we have an economic cartel.
[00:19:22.824 --> 00:19:29.306]  And you have a long-term phasing out of the dollar.
[00:19:29.326 --> 00:19:51.051]  My question to you, Alex, is what do you think the reaction of the American people will be when they're told that they're going to have to get out of the dollar, they're going to be phasing in a new currency, and as a result, they're going to be basically governed from abroad?
[00:19:52.403 --> 00:19:58.165]  Well, they're already telling them that in Time Magazine and Newsweek and everywhere else, so that's the process.
[00:19:58.205 --> 00:20:06.368]  But they frame it as this is the solution to the economic crisis, is to accept these international bankers that engineered the crisis, but they're the experts that know how to fix it.
[00:20:06.408 --> 00:20:09.529]  Give them unlimited power over your nation state and they'll fix it.
[00:20:10.049 --> 00:20:12.890]  And then there's several different plans they're debating and pushing.
[00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:18.172]  They always give you a few false choices, but it all comes from the same group, so either way they win.
[00:20:20.061 --> 00:20:22.536]  And, you know, we cover this actually in the Obama deception.
[00:20:23.823 --> 00:20:27.044]  But how they're laying it out is really simple.
[00:20:27.944 --> 00:20:36.586]  They're saying they're going to have a world authority that sets currency rates, sets currency values, that sets interest rates with complete control by this private group.
[00:20:36.606 --> 00:20:45.268]  They're already steering things and bending the world to their will, but they've got to keep control of counties, cities, the feds, the states, the Association of Governors.
[00:20:45.288 --> 00:20:49.649]  I mean, it's quite a balancing act, a juggling act they're doing.
[00:20:49.969 --> 00:20:51.650]  That's why with this new global authority,
[00:20:52.310 --> 00:21:02.540]  For their, quote, administrative convenience, as David Rockefeller has said, a global government for their administrative convenience, this will allow them a lot more control.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:12.409]  And so, at first they're just going to be dictating the regional currencies, so you'll already have a global currency because they're going to be in control of it.
[00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:16.933]  They're going to be in a centralized global level, planning it and setting it all up.
[00:21:18.134 --> 00:21:41.275]  But then they are debating whether to phase it in with different regional currencies, like the Amero, the Euro, the Asian Phoenix and others, and that's even in Money Magazine, or bypass all that completely, and even if you have cash, it'll be digitally marked to your face scan and your thumbprint, and the new global cashless society is the biometric identifier.
[00:21:41.935 --> 00:21:44.097]  And so everybody's kind of worried about global currencies,
[00:21:44.838 --> 00:21:46.679]  That's really a red herring.
[00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:52.081]  They're planning to leapfrog past that to a new global standardized cashless society.
[00:21:52.622 --> 00:21:53.522]  We're on the march.
[00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:55.623]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:56.544 --> 00:21:59.225]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.943 --> 00:22:03.525]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:03.625 --> 00:22:08.312]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:22:08.372 --> 00:22:11.135]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:22:11.336 --> 00:22:14.219]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.106]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:22:19.326 --> 00:22:20.247]  If you simply prepare.
[00:22:20.447 --> 00:22:23.430]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation with you.
[00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:30.597]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:22:30.717 --> 00:22:33.820]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.842]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[00:22:39.165 --> 00:22:40.907]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.281]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:07.782 --> 00:23:14.806]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:21.576]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:23:21.956 --> 00:23:23.798]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:23:23.938 --> 00:23:26.340]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:37.390]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:23:38.011 --> 00:23:39.292]  It's not about left or right.
[00:23:39.693 --> 00:23:41.054]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:23:41.528 --> 00:23:47.856]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:23:56.706 --> 00:23:57.848]  The Obama Deception.
[00:23:58.288 --> 00:23:59.470]  The people strike back.
[00:24:01.374 --> 00:24:08.339]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:24:08.579 --> 00:24:12.882]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:24:13.122 --> 00:24:18.245]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[00:24:18.746 --> 00:24:25.850]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:24:26.291 --> 00:24:31.174]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[00:24:31.654 --> 00:24:37.098]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:24:37.498 --> 00:24:43.002]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:25.209]  You know, I've been so busy covering North Korea, breaking the armistice, saying they're basically in a state of war, so busy covering the economy, I haven't even gotten to Soda Mayor.
[00:25:28.345 --> 00:25:31.487]  Who is a Hispanic supremacist.
[00:25:31.847 --> 00:25:35.629]  You know, whites have got white supremacists, blacks have got black nationalist supremacists.
[00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:41.532]  She is on record saying that a Hispanic woman can make better decisions than old white males in 2001.
[00:25:41.712 --> 00:25:44.133]  But we'll get to that clip later.
[00:25:44.153 --> 00:25:45.034]  That's mainstream news.
[00:25:45.074 --> 00:25:46.595]  I'm sure you've all heard about it a million times.
[00:25:48.195 --> 00:25:49.196]  She's anti-gun.
[00:25:51.857 --> 00:25:54.779]  And it just never ends, you know.
[00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:59.291]  We shouldn't be hearing about race from a judge.
[00:26:01.654 --> 00:26:03.476]  But that's who the global bankers hire.
[00:26:03.516 --> 00:26:05.217]  They just hire anybody that hates this country.
[00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:10.242]  And they love it.
[00:26:10.282 --> 00:26:14.426]  They love it that Obama creates all this racial tension and creates a racial debate.
[00:26:15.087 --> 00:26:18.651]  And then he has his Attorney General come out and say Americans are racist cowards.
[00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:20.711]  You know, they pimp it.
[00:26:20.771 --> 00:26:23.133]  They use it to divide and conquer the population.
[00:26:23.433 --> 00:26:24.093]  They love it.
[00:26:24.114 --> 00:26:26.696]  You know, they know she made all these racist comments.
[00:26:26.736 --> 00:26:27.336]  They know that.
[00:26:27.576 --> 00:26:28.597]  That's why they want her there.
[00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:30.679]  They want to freak everybody out, everybody fighting.
[00:26:30.899 --> 00:26:36.844]  Now, we can't have a Hispanic American man or woman or a white guy or a black guy who's actually a constitutionalist.
[00:26:38.065 --> 00:26:39.946]  Just everything is about what color somebody is.
[00:26:40.026 --> 00:26:41.628]  I mean, this country is in deep trouble.
[00:26:41.728 --> 00:26:42.869]  It's just going to get worse and worse.
[00:26:43.869 --> 00:26:45.811]  Let's continue with your phone calls here.
[00:26:46.432 --> 00:26:48.113]  Let's talk to Dave in Michigan.
[00:26:48.133 --> 00:26:48.934]  Dave, you're on the air.
[00:26:48.994 --> 00:26:49.274]  Welcome.
[00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:50.922]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:26:51.023 --> 00:27:07.434]  I was calling about last night's Jason Verma show when he came on air and was literally almost having a heart attack about this Supreme Court decision about no lawyers, no Miranda rights, and I was kind of surprised not to see any headlines on in-fours or PrisonPlanet.com this morning about that.
[00:27:07.874 --> 00:27:09.375]  I was really hoping that you could go into that.
[00:27:10.456 --> 00:27:14.299]  Yeah, like I said, people don't understand how small we are.
[00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:16.981]  I've got Aaron Dykes, Kurt Nemo,
[00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:22.483]  Paul Watson and Steve Watson are the four people we've got that right.
[00:27:22.523 --> 00:27:25.046]  They've got to update websites, do customer service.
[00:27:25.066 --> 00:27:29.029]  I mean, we're a small... I mean, I've got 20 employees and I can barely pay them.
[00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:36.116]  I mean, it takes a lot of money to do that and pay for the bandwidth and everything else that we do, and people just keep asking me to do this and do that.
[00:27:36.276 --> 00:27:40.400]  I did mention the Supreme Court, and I did say that was coming up.
[00:27:41.241 --> 00:27:42.382]  I don't know.
[00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:03.644]  Armistice being broken, so a state of war being between those two countries on paper.
[00:28:04.504 --> 00:28:13.166]  And what's happening in Pakistan and Iran and Israel saying they're getting ready to hit Iran and the United States and NATO and Israel launching a sneak attack on Russia on 888.
[00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:16.447]  I mean, we're in and GM saying they're about to go bankrupt.
[00:28:17.408 --> 00:28:21.148]  You know, I also wanted some time when I saw this last night to research it.
[00:28:22.809 --> 00:28:27.430]  And so I happen to have Cornell University Law School
[00:28:28.948 --> 00:28:32.390]  Sixth Amendment right to counsel, police interrogation, Miranda rights.
[00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:40.935]  And it's dealing with this ruling and it's saying that's not exactly what it does.
[00:28:41.015 --> 00:28:42.536]  So that was in my stack.
[00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:43.857]  But you're on air, sir.
[00:28:43.897 --> 00:28:45.058]  Do you have any comments about this?
[00:28:46.027 --> 00:28:49.369]  Yeah, well that's good news and I didn't mean to complain about...
[00:29:16.467 --> 00:29:18.107]  Craig Roberts told me I could post his stuff.
[00:29:18.427 --> 00:29:22.868]  Ron Paul told me we can post his stuff under our name, though my webmasters don't ever do that for some reason.
[00:29:24.208 --> 00:29:26.109]  We need more writers.
[00:29:26.409 --> 00:29:27.549]  We're a small organization.
[00:29:27.589 --> 00:29:28.849]  And listen, I'm not bitching at you.
[00:29:28.869 --> 00:29:30.409]  I'm trying to explain.
[00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.130]  I'm frustrated too.
[00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.930]  I didn't know there was 180 plus sponsors.
[00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.471]  It was 179 last week.
[00:29:37.731 --> 00:29:40.611]  Now it's over 180 for the Audit the Fed bill.
[00:29:41.631 --> 00:29:43.792]  People had to call up and say, didn't you know it went up through 179?
[00:29:46.696 --> 00:29:49.737]  Everybody thinks I'm omnipresent, and I'm not.
[00:29:49.777 --> 00:29:51.297]  I'm a regular guy, man.
[00:29:52.037 --> 00:29:53.078]  I'm a regular guy.
[00:29:53.418 --> 00:29:55.178]  But go ahead, your points.
[00:29:56.938 --> 00:29:58.119]  Well, that was basically it.
[00:29:58.199 --> 00:30:03.920]  I mean, I did some, I tried to find it on Google News, did some searching myself, and I couldn't come up with the article.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.301]  But I'm looking forward to, you know, Jason coming on and discussing it with you.
[00:30:07.821 --> 00:30:13.882]  And also, all the other points that you're hitting on today are just mind-blowing and very informative.
[00:30:13.942 --> 00:30:15.963]  So, appreciate all your hard work, Alex.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.460]  Thank you, sir.
[00:30:17.621 --> 00:30:19.842]  Yeah, no, I wasn't whining back at the listener.
[00:30:20.082 --> 00:30:25.806]  I'm just saying, we got a money bomb coming up June 11th, and I haven't even really plugged this thing.
[00:30:25.826 --> 00:30:26.707]  I haven't even talked about it.
[00:30:26.987 --> 00:30:30.929]  We need people to go sign up with the email to pledge that you're going to give.
[00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.531]  Go to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:34.352]  There's big banners.
[00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:36.553]  The website's InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:30:36.573 --> 00:30:38.795]  Let's put that up on screen for folks, please.
[00:30:39.415 --> 00:30:40.856]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:30:40.876 --> 00:30:46.320]  If you just go back to InfoWars.com, you can click on the banner right there, guys, and just punch that up for people.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.222]  But, yeah, there it is.
[00:30:52.143 --> 00:30:52.864]  And we've raised $25,000.
[00:30:53.464 --> 00:31:00.028]  We said if people want to just go ahead and give now, go ahead and do it, but we're going to try to raise a quarter million dollars.
[00:31:00.068 --> 00:31:00.829]  Sounds like a lot.
[00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:02.610]  That's nothing.
[00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.891]  That barely pays for our bandwidth in a year.
[00:31:05.252 --> 00:31:10.915]  And I don't like having to get up here and spend all my time, even though I have great sponsors, talking about sponsors, pushing it.
[00:31:11.155 --> 00:31:13.597]  But do you know what radio stations have to raise to be on the air?
[00:31:13.617 --> 00:31:14.958]  You know what networks have to raise?
[00:31:15.418 --> 00:31:16.119]  We're good to go.
[00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:40.328]  I gotta be honest, though, I almost didn't do this Money Bomb because I thought, do I even want to get that money and then try to hire a couple more people because it creeps me out having to find out who's an agent, who isn't, going through the infiltrators, you know, and I'm not scared of them coming in here and setting me up and doing something.
[00:31:40.348 --> 00:31:42.909]  I'm scared of not being able to finish my work.
[00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.651]  I mean, I'm in real cloak and dagger type stuff, folks.
[00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:47.491]  I'm living in the real world.
[00:31:47.511 --> 00:31:48.652]  Let me tell you, it isn't pretty.
[00:31:48.992 --> 00:31:52.714]  I mean, it's pretty outside, there's a lot of great things in life, but the new world order isn't pretty.
[00:31:53.434 --> 00:31:58.295]  And so, go sign up to donate on June 11th, or you can donate now.
[00:31:58.355 --> 00:31:59.956]  We have a PayPal and credit card right there.
[00:31:59.976 --> 00:32:02.216]  You can also call the toll-free number.
[00:32:02.296 --> 00:32:05.097]  Is the toll-free number listed up there?
[00:32:05.117 --> 00:32:05.377]  888-253-3139.
[00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:09.098]  Or go buy the books, the videos, the materials.
[00:32:09.158 --> 00:32:11.959]  I mean, I tell people, make copies of my films, give them to people.
[00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:14.539]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:17.280]  We just keep upgrading it, making it better and better.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.481]  You can download all the films, burn them to disk.
[00:32:20.821 --> 00:32:21.381]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:23.376 --> 00:32:27.858]  You know, I wish I could spend all my time writing and making films and doing this.
[00:32:27.918 --> 00:32:47.588]  I spend most of my time fiddling with taxes, fiddling with regulations, new bureaucrats that created like three new agencies with the state of Texas that come and harass us and demand to audit things and bureaucrats stomping around like they own everything and I'm a slave and dealing with dirty tricks people are pulling and dealing with, you know,
[00:32:48.778 --> 00:32:51.819]  The power getting turned off at my house because I forget to pay a bill.
[00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.479]  I mean, I am a regular guy, folks.
[00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:59.200]  And just to get control of my life, I've had to stop doing as many radio interviews.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.780]  I turn down two or three interviews a day now.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.801]  And those people never call back.
[00:33:03.261 --> 00:33:06.061]  Those are contacts that are dead because I turned them down.
[00:33:06.861 --> 00:33:12.383]  They always get scorned because I don't see my children even two or three hours a day unless I cancel these interviews.
[00:33:12.763 --> 00:33:13.763]  I don't get the bills paid.
[00:33:15.595 --> 00:33:17.458]  Deal with employees fighting with each other.
[00:33:17.478 --> 00:33:18.699]  You know, it's all the crap.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.822]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:33:21.143 --> 00:33:23.426]  But I don't work at some big corporation.
[00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:24.707]  I am InfoWars.
[00:33:25.268 --> 00:33:26.069]  I deal with it all.
[00:33:27.122 --> 00:33:32.885]  I deal with egomaniacs in this movement, because all of society is mentally ill and very sick right now, and very worldly.
[00:33:33.465 --> 00:33:41.530]  Constant attacks, constant infighting, and I've learned to just turn the other cheek, take it, even though I'm not wrong, I'm wrong, just good, I'll be the bad guy.
[00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:48.233]  Because we gotta beat the New World Order before they start World War III, before they release a real superflu, before they nuke a city.
[00:33:48.614 --> 00:33:50.755]  This isn't a game, this is real!
[00:33:51.857 --> 00:33:59.845]  And a lot of you out there that are sucking your thumbs and ninnying and engaging all the baloney, as things get worse and worse, you're going to wish you had taken action.
[00:34:00.606 --> 00:34:03.089]  But we still have time to stop this if people grow up.
[00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.132]  You've got to get on the road, though, folks.
[00:34:06.312 --> 00:34:09.215]  And again, there is no neutral position here.
[00:34:09.335 --> 00:34:11.037]  Doing nothing is a decision.
[00:34:11.918 --> 00:34:13.360]  Doing nothing has consequences.
[00:34:14.577 --> 00:34:16.258]  Either join evil or join good.
[00:34:16.338 --> 00:34:21.360]  But don't make excuses of your police or military or news people or government bureaucrats.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.440]  You know this is evil.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.961]  You know things are getting worse.
[00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:25.401]  You know there's corruption in place.
[00:34:25.861 --> 00:34:29.443]  And a lot of people, as they get scared, they decide to join the evil.
[00:34:29.483 --> 00:34:32.524]  They decide to do whatever they're told just to hold on.
[00:34:32.544 --> 00:34:37.225]  A lot of times as things get worse, some people wake up and take action, but just as many
[00:34:38.846 --> 00:34:40.606]  Throw themselves down before the evil.
[00:34:40.867 --> 00:34:42.047]  They become buffaloed.
[00:34:42.107 --> 00:34:42.967]  They roll over.
[00:34:43.527 --> 00:34:45.748]  I'm not rolling over, and I know I'm good.
[00:34:46.208 --> 00:34:47.108]  I know I'm real.
[00:34:47.468 --> 00:34:50.229]  I know I'm not perfect, but I'm doing the best job I can.
[00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:54.070]  I frustratedly get mad that my body gets tired.
[00:34:54.090 --> 00:35:03.793]  I frustratedly get mad that some days I don't want to work 14, 15, 16 hours a day, because I know this is a short life, and I know we're facing pure evil, and I don't have any
[00:35:06.314 --> 00:35:08.036]  Diversions or delusions about that.
[00:35:08.497 --> 00:35:09.879]  And I realize what we're facing.
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:17.169]  And I realize more and more that fighting the New World Order, changing the system we live in, is about an inside job.
[00:35:17.269 --> 00:35:18.451]  Like the Don Henley song says.
[00:35:19.272 --> 00:35:20.754]  It's an inside job just like it always is.
[00:35:22.026 --> 00:35:23.187]  I've got to change who I am.
[00:35:23.267 --> 00:35:24.568]  You've got to change who you are.
[00:35:25.229 --> 00:35:29.472]  You know, it doesn't even hurt my feelings with somebody I've lifted up and built and promoted.
[00:35:29.492 --> 00:35:33.896]  I mean, I don't know of anybody, except a very few people that haven't stabbed me in the back.
[00:35:34.376 --> 00:35:37.238]  Very few, like a Jason Bermas, a Jack McClam, a few others.
[00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:43.684]  Almost everyone is so obsessed with my success and my celebrity, which is a curse, really.
[00:35:43.704 --> 00:35:50.970]  You know, it's got the blessings because I can reach out and reach a lot of people, but it has the curse in that man is so fallen and people are so petty
[00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:57.612]  That all these people I tried to build up and tried to give platforms, they don't appreciate it, they hate me for it.
[00:35:58.012 --> 00:36:12.398]  When I was only looking for soldiers, I was only looking for captains, I was only looking for generals, I was only looking for people to try to raise up as I was risen up by others to be part of the big win against tyranny.
[00:36:13.414 --> 00:36:15.356]  And you know, it doesn't hurt me when I'm attacked.
[00:36:15.416 --> 00:36:16.638]  It hurts me for them.
[00:36:16.658 --> 00:36:19.280]  The megalomania, the power trips.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.303]  And then I see in them myself.
[00:36:21.683 --> 00:36:23.805]  I see in them what I've been in the past.
[00:36:23.885 --> 00:36:25.347]  I see in them the mistakes I've made.
[00:36:25.647 --> 00:36:32.735]  I see in them how, you know, we all grow and so then you can't even really hate them.
[00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:37.668]  Now the New World Order I do really hate because they're conscious of what they're doing.
[00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:39.029]  They understand human nature.
[00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:40.170]  They understand wisdom.
[00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:52.559]  And they've decided to bend that wisdom towards dominating innocent people and doing horrible things that hurt innocence and hurt beauty and hurt creativity and hurt the human spirit that's meant to be uplifted and grow and build things.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:02.566]  And I just really feel sad for those that are missing out on what life's really all about because I am discovering such fulfillment and
[00:37:07.028 --> 00:37:12.411]  I'm just changing as a person where I almost enjoy taking the blame.
[00:37:12.431 --> 00:37:13.912]  I almost enjoy being hated.
[00:37:14.152 --> 00:37:23.578]  Because I understand that that spirit of being humble is really not even the strongest spirit, even though it is.
[00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:26.160]  It's just that that's what I was meant to be.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.401]  I'm home now.
[00:37:28.421 --> 00:37:30.062]  I've always been a good-natured person.
[00:37:30.403 --> 00:37:32.284]  You say, oh, that dog's a good-natured old dog.
[00:37:33.314 --> 00:37:34.514]  I'm a sweet person.
[00:37:35.414 --> 00:37:38.055]  And I always grew up thinking everybody was like me.
[00:37:38.095 --> 00:37:40.035]  Everybody was sweet and loving and had a big heart.
[00:37:40.275 --> 00:37:41.576]  And they don't, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:42.056 --> 00:37:43.316]  We're a very sick society.
[00:37:43.356 --> 00:37:46.317]  We're so cold-blooded, we'll kill 51 million babies.
[00:37:47.017 --> 00:37:47.557]  And counting.
[00:37:48.157 --> 00:37:48.877]  And be proud of it.
[00:37:49.797 --> 00:37:50.938]  And make excuses about it.
[00:37:50.958 --> 00:37:53.038]  You know, you can make excuses all day, that's murder.
[00:37:53.238 --> 00:37:57.319]  You can make excuses all day about the police turning into police state, but we all know it is.
[00:37:57.659 --> 00:38:01.540]  You can make excuses all day about the foreign bankers raping us and robbing us, but we know it is.
[00:38:03.887 --> 00:38:09.310]  Now, let's call Burmas in because the caller was talking about how he talked about it last night.
[00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.570]  I saw this last night.
[00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.931]  I actually printed it off Drudge.
[00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:15.333]  The caller was saying he... Burmas just ran off.
[00:38:15.353 --> 00:38:16.093]  He was waiting to come in here.
[00:38:18.274 --> 00:38:20.055]  The... Yeah, come on in.
[00:38:20.495 --> 00:38:25.117]  How many times... The caller is saying he can't find it.
[00:38:25.177 --> 00:38:26.618]  Let me read to you the headline.
[00:38:26.938 --> 00:38:31.100]  Supreme Court rules police can initiate suspects questioning.
[00:38:32.856 --> 00:38:46.499]  And it says, by a 5-4 vote, the conservative majority, they're not conservatives, overhaul a 23-year-old Supreme Court decision that barred the police from initiating questioning after a defendant asserted their right to an attorney and an arraignment or similar proceeding.
[00:38:47.619 --> 00:38:58.882]  See, because the police were so corrupt in the 70s and stuff and all this happened that they passed laws and had rulings that the police just can't say because they put a gun to your head or intimidated you that you said you committed the murder or whatever.
[00:39:00.502 --> 00:39:06.887]  In 1986 decision held that once a defendant invoked a right to counsel, only the suspect and not the police can initiate the contact.
[00:39:07.368 --> 00:39:11.931]  That's saying don't start interrogations on people without people's counsel.
[00:39:11.951 --> 00:39:13.993]  And that goes back to the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:39:14.333 --> 00:39:16.775]  That would be conservative would be to keep that.
[00:39:17.396 --> 00:39:17.636]  See?
[00:39:17.656 --> 00:39:26.062]  And it goes on, expanding the power of police to question suspects, but it does not change the landmark 66 ruling barring the police from questioning
[00:39:26.923 --> 00:39:33.788]  A suspect, who invoked the right to remain silent or have a lawyer present, initially waived his right to a lawyer and was questioned by the police.
[00:39:34.188 --> 00:39:35.970]  He told several conflicting stories.
[00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:42.514]  Several days later, he appeared in court in a preliminary hearing and told a local judge appointed a lawyer to represent him, who could not afford an attorney.
[00:39:42.534 --> 00:39:46.397]  And how this works is they say, look at these criminals, we need to get tough on them.
[00:39:46.437 --> 00:39:48.559]  But you get Nazi Germany, you get Soviet Russia.
[00:39:48.999 --> 00:39:55.344]  You take people's due process and their protections away, you get a tyranny, which is always the greatest threat to liberty.
[00:39:55.984 --> 00:39:58.326]  Throughout history, so the founders knew to protect that.
[00:39:58.366 --> 00:40:07.513]  It sounds crazy the way the media advertises it and the way they act, but really we need these and better ten guilty men to go free than one innocent man go to prison.
[00:40:07.754 --> 00:40:15.079]  Now the attitude the feds have said, oh it doesn't matter if around the country, you know, over a third of the people on death row are totally innocent or maybe half.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.942]  You know, a few innocent people are going to go to the
[00:40:19.093 --> 00:40:21.455]  Lethal injection, so that we are all safe.
[00:40:21.515 --> 00:40:23.097]  See, that's Napoleonic.
[00:40:23.357 --> 00:40:23.998]  That's tyranny.
[00:40:24.218 --> 00:40:31.224]  That's the flip side, the opposite of the Renaissance, of the Magna Carta, of Mosaic Law, of freedom.
[00:40:32.225 --> 00:40:35.188]  But we did pull up a Cornell Law University.
[00:40:35.208 --> 00:40:41.253]  They're saying it doesn't quite get rid of you being able to say, I'm not talking to you until I see my attorney.
[00:40:42.454 --> 00:40:47.777]  It's saying if the police can trick you to talk, they can now use it as admissible.
[00:40:47.797 --> 00:40:49.118]  But it is a pretty big deal.
[00:40:49.138 --> 00:40:49.979]  Jason, your comments on that?
[00:40:49.999 --> 00:40:51.639]  Yeah, you know, it really fired me up, Alex.
[00:40:51.679 --> 00:40:52.380]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.181]  Because now the cops are just going to say, oh, he said he didn't need a lawyer.
[00:40:55.362 --> 00:41:01.305]  You know, it's going to be the cops' word against yours when they interrogate you, and it's going to be... Well, it's like rulings saying you don't have a Fourth Amendment now.
[00:41:01.445 --> 00:41:01.926]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:02.006 --> 00:41:04.990]  And then on top of that, they always make it look like it was so close.
[00:41:05.091 --> 00:41:06.012]  Oh, it's 5-4.
[00:41:06.192 --> 00:41:09.617]  When was the last time we saw a 9-0 or a 7-2 ruling?
[00:41:09.798 --> 00:41:10.879]  It's always 5-4.
[00:41:10.899 --> 00:41:13.724]  Oh, we were this close to keeping your civil liberties.
[00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:15.446]  Oh, but the liberals are protecting you.
[00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:17.009]  They want to ban your free speech, but...
[00:41:17.449 --> 00:41:19.130]  They'll allow you to not have to answer questions.
[00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:20.672]  It's all a dog and pony show.
[00:41:20.752 --> 00:41:21.252]  Exactly.
[00:41:21.292 --> 00:41:22.493]  And I was just so upset.
[00:41:22.553 --> 00:41:32.741]  I can't believe that if I get, you know, pulled over, detained, and I say, I'm not talking to you until I get my lawyer here, they'll just be like, okay, and just, you know, throw me to the side, maybe hit me with a baton.
[00:41:32.781 --> 00:41:34.443]  Oh, he came in with a... But you know, they already do that.
[00:41:34.463 --> 00:41:36.905]  I know a lot of people get thrown in jail for months without lawyers.
[00:41:36.925 --> 00:41:37.485]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:37.906 --> 00:41:38.746]  No, that's happening on paper.
[00:41:39.727 --> 00:41:40.508]  You know, that's the problem.
[00:41:40.528 --> 00:41:42.430]  They're making a Supreme Court decision about it.
[00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:43.551]  Yes, are police corrupt?
[00:41:43.571 --> 00:41:43.731]  Yes.
[00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:44.592]  Have they done this before?
[00:41:44.632 --> 00:41:44.792]  Yes.
[00:41:44.852 --> 00:41:46.454]  But now they're saying, it's okay, police.
[00:41:46.694 --> 00:41:47.815]  You can get away with this now.
[00:41:48.215 --> 00:41:53.961]  Hey, what about Loraza Mecha, member of the new Supreme Court nominee?
[00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:56.924]  I mean, this lady has come right out.
[00:41:57.124 --> 00:41:57.785]  Here's her quote.
[00:41:57.905 --> 00:42:02.709]  I would hope that a wise Latino woman with the richness of her experiences
[00:42:03.618 --> 00:42:28.238]  would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male hasn't lived that life and and there's and that's what judge said this is out of the new york times uh... said uh... and it goes on and she's a member of loraza and there's even more disturbing quote on the third page but you know what loraza means it means for our race everything for those outside the race nothing folks i don't care if you're hispanic or whatever i'm sick of the fact that a massive percentage
[00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:45.935]  of hispanics have been filled with this idea that get the gringos haha our race is the god grace we had uh... mayor here he had uh... as long day and said we are the subject of the race and it says whether born from experience inherent psychological cultural differences
[00:42:46.295 --> 00:42:52.762]  She said, for jurists who are women and non-white, our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging.
[00:42:53.222 --> 00:42:57.747]  So, yeah, this is like a commissar who's going to inject race into this.
[00:42:58.087 --> 00:43:00.210]  This is what creates the racism, folks.
[00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.950]  Stay there, Jason.
[00:43:01.191 --> 00:43:01.871]  Race pimps!
[00:43:02.771 --> 00:43:05.515]  If being prepared doesn't apply to you, disregard the next minute.

[00:43:13.945 --> 00:43:21.054]  How would you or could you disinfect a school bus, office, locker room, place of worship or your entire home and do it in just minutes?

[00:44:02.048 --> 00:44:03.389]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:44:03.569 --> 00:44:08.550]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[00:44:08.951 --> 00:44:11.031]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[00:44:11.372 --> 00:44:20.435]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[00:44:20.855 --> 00:44:27.597]  This program has already settled over 100 million dollars of debt and are saving individual consumers thousands of dollars.
[00:44:27.917 --> 00:44:34.059]  Folks, if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments, the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[00:44:34.239 --> 00:44:37.900]  Call the bailout group today at 1-800-324-6554.

[00:44:55.685 --> 00:44:57.226]  800-324-6554.
[00:44:57.906 --> 00:45:01.427]  The Bailout Group.
[00:45:01.927 --> 00:45:02.488]  You worry.
[00:45:02.628 --> 00:45:04.708]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:45:04.988 --> 00:45:05.249]  Hi.
[00:45:05.509 --> 00:45:08.010]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:12.551]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:45:12.851 --> 00:45:15.032]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:18.333]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:45:18.673 --> 00:45:19.074]  We're good.
[00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:41.596]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[00:45:41.936 --> 00:45:44.078]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[00:45:44.298 --> 00:45:45.979]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:50.603]  So go to upthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:45:51.064 --> 00:45:51.704]  Start now.
[00:45:51.985 --> 00:45:52.946]  Knowledge is power.
[00:45:53.686 --> 00:45:54.507]  Better take action.
[00:45:54.707 --> 00:45:55.648]  I think a storm's coming.
[00:46:10.798 --> 00:46:16.064]  A key European Union Bilderberg Group document has just surfaced.
[00:46:16.124 --> 00:46:17.366]  Great article by a listener.
[00:46:17.866 --> 00:46:19.328]  Posted at InfoWars.com.
[00:46:19.348 --> 00:46:23.573]  Aaron's going to pop in for like five minutes coming up, and then I'm going to continue with your phone calls.
[00:46:25.814 --> 00:46:35.178]  For everybody that is patiently holding, and we're going to be talking to Jason Vermas finishing up, just a moment about this horrid Supreme Court nominee.
[00:46:35.198 --> 00:46:51.426]  I mean, could I just have a Hispanic Supreme Court judge that doesn't believe Texas and California belong to Mexico and doesn't believe that the plan of San Diego should, I mean, if she's part of La Raza, for the race everything, for those that said the race nothing, she believes the implementation of the plan of San Diego.
[00:46:52.406 --> 00:46:55.527]  And I mean, you know, again, if you don't know what that is, Google it.
[00:46:55.887 --> 00:46:59.149]  Guys, Google the plan of San Diego, and people will see it on screen.
[00:46:59.209 --> 00:47:01.290]  University of Texas, University of Mexico City.
[00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:06.892]  It is the plan to kill all whites, 16 and above, and re-educate all whites.
[00:47:07.652 --> 00:47:17.637]  And this is what is taught by Mecha, La Raza, and, I mean, I'm against the Ku Klux Klan, but they're not saying they have a plan to kill
[00:47:21.755 --> 00:47:22.755]  You know, all blacks.
[00:47:22.775 --> 00:47:25.136]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:47:26.757 --> 00:47:29.478]  And that's off the University of Texas right there.
[00:47:29.858 --> 00:47:35.141]  So you can read about the plan to kill you and your family right there that the new Supreme Court nominee would like to carry out.
[00:47:35.521 --> 00:47:36.421]  Very, very disgusting.
[00:47:36.461 --> 00:47:40.823]  See, their racism's good, and then everybody else is supposed to stand down and be overrun by it.
[00:47:41.123 --> 00:47:42.424]  And that's what the global bankers want.
[00:47:43.024 --> 00:47:46.647]  Before we go back to Jason Bermas, Ecolablue is one of our great sponsors.
[00:47:46.727 --> 00:47:48.148]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[00:47:48.208 --> 00:47:49.449]  Pays for itself in one year.
[00:47:49.469 --> 00:47:53.171]  If you buy your water from the store, check out Ecolablue.com, folks.
[00:47:53.191 --> 00:47:54.492]  You won't be disappointed.
[00:47:54.772 --> 00:47:56.334]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[00:47:56.394 --> 00:47:57.915]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[00:47:58.175 --> 00:47:59.436]  Do exactly what you're drinking.
[00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:01.917]  Machine produces up to 7.5 gallons a day.
[00:48:02.298 --> 00:48:05.800]  The generated water is passed through seven filters, including reverse osmosis and carbon.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:06.861]  Simple to use.
[00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:08.502]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[00:48:08.922 --> 00:48:09.783]  Neutral pH.
[00:48:10.043 --> 00:48:11.824]  Your own source of clean drinking water.
[00:48:12.768 --> 00:48:14.689]  Now the filtering process works.
[00:48:14.729 --> 00:48:26.853]  The water is passed through an active carbon filter, then a silver impregnated carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system, then it takes an odor removal filter and is stored in an illuminated tank, eliminated by an antibacterial fungal UV light.
[00:48:27.133 --> 00:48:30.194]  A coloblue.com or 1-800-691-6043.
[00:48:30.214 --> 00:48:31.474]  1-800-691-6043.
[00:48:31.894 --> 00:48:35.935]  Okay, Jason, finishing up.
[00:48:35.955 --> 00:48:37.896]  Yeah, you've done a lot of research on this lady.
[00:48:38.336 --> 00:48:40.337]  There's that New York Times article you were talking about.
[00:48:41.177 --> 00:48:45.921]  Other points about the Mexican supremacist to be our new gun-grabbing leader.
[00:48:46.141 --> 00:48:49.563]  Well, number one, she is a council member on La Raza.
[00:48:49.583 --> 00:48:51.525]  So she's not a member, you know, she's a council member.
[00:48:51.545 --> 00:48:53.786]  You know, like Herman Goering was on the council of Hitler.
[00:48:53.846 --> 00:48:54.006]  Yeah.
[00:48:54.186 --> 00:48:55.627]  She's on the council of the others.
[00:48:55.667 --> 00:48:55.828]  Yeah.
[00:48:56.128 --> 00:48:59.590]  And she's a Bush 1 appointee back in the 90s in New York.
[00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.912]  You know, you know this lady is going to come in
[00:49:02.452 --> 00:49:03.553]  And take away our sovereignty.
[00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:04.393]  She's a globalist!
[00:49:04.413 --> 00:49:06.194]  Yes, she's about a North American Union.
[00:49:06.214 --> 00:49:07.795]  I don't want to lose my sovereignty to Canada.
[00:49:08.055 --> 00:49:18.941]  I don't want to lose my... Well, by the way, she and others have said, that's what's not getting attention, like all the liberal Supreme Court members have said, we're going to follow UN and NATO and Hague Courts, World Court.
[00:49:19.021 --> 00:49:19.901]  That's our boss.
[00:49:20.241 --> 00:49:21.042]  This is high treason.
[00:49:21.702 --> 00:49:24.804]  But see, if you're not for high treason, you hate Mexicans, Burmese.
[00:49:25.484 --> 00:49:26.545]  And that's just not the case.
[00:49:26.865 --> 00:49:29.407]  You know, I could care less what color you are.
[00:49:29.587 --> 00:49:31.129]  No, no, see, they make it racial.
[00:49:31.529 --> 00:49:33.070]  They make us defend ourselves.
[00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:34.612]  She's a Mexican supremacist.
[00:49:34.932 --> 00:49:36.073]  She's an America hater.
[00:49:36.613 --> 00:49:37.334]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:49:37.394 --> 00:49:37.794]  And you know what?
[00:49:37.814 --> 00:49:40.717]  They're having this new immigration reform meeting on June 8th.
[00:49:41.357 --> 00:49:42.138]  They call it reform.
[00:49:42.178 --> 00:49:43.099]  Total capitulation.
[00:49:43.119 --> 00:49:43.459]  Exactly.
[00:49:43.659 --> 00:49:45.701]  It's going to be illegal immigration.
[00:49:45.981 --> 00:49:47.222]  Illegal immigrants are no longer illegal.
[00:49:47.242 --> 00:49:52.567]  That's why these domestic lexicons say if you're anti-illegal immigration, you're an extremist.
[00:49:52.807 --> 00:49:55.750]  If you believe in the Constitution and Bill of Rights, you're an extremist.
[00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:57.752]  This is the wildest thing in the world.
[00:49:57.772 --> 00:50:01.715]  They're really gearing up, I think, within the next two years to just totally eviscerate.
[00:50:01.735 --> 00:50:04.278]  And she loves to talk about how white males are bad.
[00:50:04.778 --> 00:50:06.700]  Imagine if we came out and said Mexicans were bad.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:07.941]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:11.202]  I mean, you're a bad guy because you were born white and a man?
[00:50:11.582 --> 00:50:13.363]  I mean, we should all be judged on that.
[00:50:13.403 --> 00:50:14.864]  Look, look, look, look, look, look.
[00:50:14.904 --> 00:50:17.745]  If the British Empire would have been run by Africans, everybody would hate blacks.
[00:50:18.245 --> 00:50:20.366]  They hate whoever is dominant and takes over.
[00:50:20.866 --> 00:50:23.527]  And the truth is, all these groups just wish they could take over.
[00:50:24.068 --> 00:50:24.608]  It is the issue.
[00:50:24.748 --> 00:50:26.869]  I want everybody to have liberty and freedom now.
[00:50:27.529 --> 00:50:28.850]  I don't care what color you are.
[00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:32.111]  Stop letting them use left-right racial politics.
[00:50:32.512 --> 00:50:33.252]  Farmers, anything else?
[00:50:33.652 --> 00:50:34.752]  That's all I got for you, Alex.
[00:50:34.832 --> 00:50:39.954]  But you'll be back tonight with the InfoWarrior 9 to midnight, right here on GCN and at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:39.994 --> 00:50:41.134]  Stay with us, back in 70 seconds.

[00:50:52.208 --> 00:51:00.573]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:51:00.853 --> 00:51:05.256]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[00:51:05.697 --> 00:51:10.880]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[00:52:15.324 --> 00:52:16.864]  Okay, I'm gonna blitz through your calls.
[00:52:17.044 --> 00:52:23.746]  Dave, John, Leo, Richard, uh, Tori, and Nick, when we come back in the next segment.
[00:52:25.106 --> 00:52:30.447]  Then I got one of the Seathink producers and directors coming on, because he's got a lot of heat, for myself included.
[00:52:31.838 --> 00:52:34.841]  Dealing with the C-Think Film New World Order that's just a huge success.
[00:52:34.921 --> 00:52:36.182]  It's got to get a lot of attention.
[00:52:36.202 --> 00:52:36.822]  Top ratings.
[00:52:37.223 --> 00:52:40.685]  Record ratings last night for IFC and record downloads.
[00:52:41.146 --> 00:52:45.269]  I wasn't supposed to get into that, but it's hundreds of thousands on the on-demand.
[00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:46.951]  It's more if anything than they've ever seen.
[00:52:48.132 --> 00:52:51.915]  So, obviously I'll have my new IFC TV show.
[00:52:53.396 --> 00:52:56.778]  I could have had those kind of things a long time ago, but who knows, I might actually do one.
[00:52:57.499 --> 00:53:00.621]  The issue here is that I'm going to keep doing this radio show.
[00:53:00.981 --> 00:53:05.484]  That's where we can do everything unedited, uncut, and really get everything out.
[00:53:05.504 --> 00:53:08.206]  But they say IFC is the place where it's always uncut.
[00:53:08.226 --> 00:53:10.927]  It's not perfect for me, huh?
[00:53:11.007 --> 00:53:15.050]  The point is that there's no doubt we'll knock it out of the park either way you slice it.
[00:53:16.662 --> 00:53:18.963]  Aaron, you had some interesting news.
[00:53:19.643 --> 00:53:29.227]  Hundreds of documents have come out in the last few years, smuggled out of National Archives in Europe, where the Bilderberg Group was set up by kind of the Nazi money and the British U.S.
[00:53:29.267 --> 00:53:31.187]  money, teaming up to set up world government.
[00:53:31.468 --> 00:53:35.049]  They bragged, they covertly set up the European Union 50 years before they admitted it.
[00:53:35.449 --> 00:53:38.330]  We're already under the North American Union, the public doesn't know we have the secret treaty.
[00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.211]  People sued and got it, Judicial Watch did.
[00:53:40.871 --> 00:53:42.252]  More documents keep coming out.
[00:53:42.332 --> 00:53:49.574]  One of our listeners did a great article breaking one of these down, and we've separately vetted that ourselves and checked it so it is accurate.
[00:53:50.055 --> 00:53:55.056]  And Etienne D'Avignon is now giving interviews in the European press, the head of the Bilderberg Group, going, yeah, we really run things.
[00:53:55.136 --> 00:53:58.958]  So they've gotten to the point where they're just ready to throw it in everybody's face.
[00:53:59.537 --> 00:54:02.461]  Yeah, and at the end, Davignon admitted they created the euro.
[00:54:02.841 --> 00:54:05.224]  You know, what was it, 55 years before or something?
[00:54:05.645 --> 00:54:09.469]  And now we have more documents that some of our great Dutch listeners have dug up.
[00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:11.171]  A guy named H.R.
[00:54:11.251 --> 00:54:15.016]  Noord, known as Mr. Europe, calling for a federation of Europe.
[00:54:15.036 --> 00:54:16.057]  Let's give that Ryder credit.
[00:54:17.014 --> 00:54:21.796]  Yeah, he's calling for world government through a European federation only as an intermediate step for world government.
[00:54:21.816 --> 00:54:23.137]  You know, they're always attacking the League of Nations.
[00:54:23.197 --> 00:54:24.858]  It wasn't strong enough because some
[00:54:38.264 --> 00:54:39.585]  National sovereignty remains.
[00:54:39.645 --> 00:54:40.185]  Read the article!
[00:54:40.426 --> 00:54:42.607]  And they're calling for the end of all sovereignty.
[00:54:43.007 --> 00:54:56.136]  In a series of pamphlets constructed in the latter days of the German occupation of the European continent for the Dutch, Dave Bonbreaker magazine, Pioneer magazine, one of the founders of the European Parliament, H.R.
[00:54:56.216 --> 00:55:05.782]  Nord, nicknamed Mr. Europe, wrote that all European countries should prepare to construct a European federation as a first step in the direction of a world government.
[00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:27.671]  When, by the end of 1944, it became clear the Nazis were doomed in their conquest for world domination with two impatient superpowers waiting in the rings, Nord elaborated on this idea in a three-part series explaining that steps towards a world government should be pursued to rid the world once and for all of a future German aspiration for world domination.
[00:55:28.251 --> 00:55:30.732]  And it goes, but it's Germany at the heart of Europe.
[00:55:31.193 --> 00:55:35.935]  Oh, we want this government so we don't dominate, but that's actually what dominates Europe.
[00:55:36.535 --> 00:55:49.842]  And that's what the Bilderberg is, is that nexus of that Germanic empire with the Anglo-American thing that's Germanic to begin with, with the Rothschilds kind of wrapped around and interbred into the middle of it, a very sickening concoction.
[00:55:50.382 --> 00:56:14.416]  But the separate declassified army documents say this, but I've read Shires, Reisenthal, the Third Reich, Heinz Hobel's Order of the Deathshead, and scores of other encyclopedic books off mainline documents, but you never see this on the news, that Hitler planned a European Union to govern the planet and then carry out eugenics, and he got the model from the US and England, and they set him up and cut his legs out from under him.
[00:56:14.796 --> 00:56:18.278]  It was all a big setup because they wanted to do it with a soft kill mode.
[00:56:18.638 --> 00:56:21.302]  But now, separate Dutch documents confirm it.
[00:56:21.702 --> 00:56:23.044]  But this is mainline history!
[00:56:24.066 --> 00:56:30.315]  Yeah, in the name of Hitler, they're gonna burn the power of the German people, and then pursue the ultimate plans anyway, world government.
[00:56:30.928 --> 00:56:32.870]  In the name of stopping another Hitler!
[00:56:33.271 --> 00:56:34.412]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[00:56:34.432 --> 00:56:44.562]  But notice, that is a systematic, it's like a dark, almost fourth, fifth dimensional, and by that I mean the level of thinking is so complex.
[00:56:45.363 --> 00:56:50.889]  Philosophy, or English, they put on like a cube, on a ball and in a pool.
[00:56:51.329 --> 00:56:56.794]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?

[00:58:02.241 --> 00:58:04.803]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:58:05.416 --> 00:58:07.561]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:08.042 --> 00:58:15.038]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:58:15.626 --> 00:58:21.809]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:58:22.149 --> 00:58:24.030]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:26.612]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:58:26.692 --> 00:58:37.637]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:58:38.257 --> 00:58:39.538]  It's not about left or right.
[00:58:39.938 --> 00:58:41.279]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:48.126]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:58.090]  The Obama Deception.
[00:58:58.530 --> 00:58:59.691]  The people strike back.
[00:59:01.738 --> 00:59:05.001]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:59:05.161 --> 00:59:09.244]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:59:09.424 --> 00:59:20.852]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:59:21.093 --> 00:59:26.917]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:59:27.157 --> 00:59:27.778]  We're good to go!
[00:59:49.124 --> 00:59:52.428]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.603 --> 01:00:20.690]  Okay, we're going to your calls here in just a momento, but right now, finish up your story about the European Union and what it was really set up to be.
[01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:27.434]  Well, once again, we got exclusive documents from 1945 translated out of Dutch by some of our great listeners.
[01:00:27.935 --> 01:00:30.697]  Yeah, this is an exclusive at Infowars.com.
[01:00:30.777 --> 01:00:31.477]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:00:31.837 --> 01:00:37.561]  And it's just another piece of the riddle that national sovereignty can't exist anymore because there's terrible people in the world.
[01:00:37.981 --> 01:00:38.802]  So we have to have some
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.842]  You know, authoritarian union worldwide to control us all.
[01:00:43.862 --> 01:00:44.802]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:00:45.443 --> 01:00:55.287]  So the elite can really start waging war with eugenics on their real target, the people, which the wars have always been, as Orwell wrote, the wars are set up by the elites to suppress their own population.
[01:00:55.747 --> 01:01:00.169]  Kim Jong-il gets a reprieve from overthrow with the saber-rattling.
[01:01:00.449 --> 01:01:03.371]  The West gets to look like good guys, setting themselves up against him.
[01:01:03.791 --> 01:01:05.392]  South Korea gets to take more freedoms.
[01:01:06.212 --> 01:01:07.653]  See how it works perfectly for them?
[01:01:07.753 --> 01:01:11.014]  Yeah, and they knew the League of Nations wouldn't be strong enough for the desires.
[01:01:11.054 --> 01:01:17.136]  They knew the United Nations didn't have the teeth they wanted, but they, by integrating... Well, they orchestrated both those wars!
[01:01:17.436 --> 01:01:23.618]  Yeah, but they knew it was, you know, one step after another to this takeover, this worldwide takeover.
[01:01:24.018 --> 01:01:27.559]  And they're shoveling us into this dictatorship, worldwide dictatorship.
[01:01:28.052 --> 01:01:30.173]  First through Europe, then through a greater region.
[01:01:30.553 --> 01:01:32.773]  It's in all these articles, every time they come up.
[01:01:32.793 --> 01:01:40.516]  And now they admit they want a world government run by them, there's no more denial, but Bloomberg comes out and says, I'm totally insane, there's no Halliburton FEMA camps.
[01:01:40.816 --> 01:01:42.816]  Doesn't matter, it's in the New York Times and the Houston Chronicle.
[01:01:43.836 --> 01:01:46.177]  I'm totally crazy, there was no Secret Service at Bilderberg.
[01:01:46.197 --> 01:01:50.938]  We're literal schizophrenics, Aaron, running around just delusionally.
[01:01:51.279 --> 01:01:52.899]  Isn't that going to backfire on the media?
[01:01:53.019 --> 01:01:55.260]  Yeah, a year and a half ago, Bilderberg doesn't exist.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.645]  Davignon and others are admitting they've been planning it since at least 1955.
[01:02:01.147 --> 01:02:02.388]  Why do you think they're going public now?
[01:02:02.409 --> 01:02:06.134]  Because we exposed them and so they're just gonna hide in plain view and act like it's no big deal, or?
[01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:07.596]  More or less, yeah.
[01:02:08.288 --> 01:02:09.209]  That's a good question.
[01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.749]  I mean, what?
[01:02:10.029 --> 01:02:12.551]  I mean, you know, first they told the public, oh, there's no ruling elite.
[01:02:12.571 --> 01:02:13.652]  There's no corrupt elite.
[01:02:13.692 --> 01:02:15.213]  Your police are locally run.
[01:02:15.233 --> 01:02:18.115]  And the 14.8 trillion's for your children.
[01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:22.058]  And I mean, now it's just, hey, martial law, if you don't like it, we're going to kill you.
[01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:25.200]  I mean, you know, it's just, it's so pathetic, Aaron.
[01:02:25.761 --> 01:02:31.605]  Once you get into tyranny, historically, there's only a few degrees separation until you're in the worst form of tyranny.
[01:02:31.965 --> 01:02:33.226]  People don't realize we're now here.
[01:02:33.246 --> 01:02:34.587]  Yeah.
[01:02:34.927 --> 01:02:37.289]  And national sovereignty has no place, apparently.
[01:02:37.722 --> 01:02:40.766]  According to this guy in 1945, according to Richard Haass...
[01:02:57.146 --> 01:02:58.647]  We linked to this story on InfoWars.
[01:02:58.667 --> 01:03:03.849]  They were commenting with the quotes on 1984 where you weren't supposed to smile because that could be seen as obnoxious.
[01:03:04.109 --> 01:03:06.430]  And now you can't smile on a facial recognition, right?
[01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:07.390]  Yeah, because they want you.
[01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:11.992]  Well, they don't tell the slaves in USA Today that we're not getting your proper face scan.
[01:03:12.452 --> 01:03:13.312]  But yes, that's it.
[01:03:14.673 --> 01:03:15.393]  It's incredible.
[01:03:15.753 --> 01:03:18.034]  Doesn't somebody call it the worldwide straitjacket?
[01:03:18.373 --> 01:03:19.914]  For your own good, you can't do anything.
[01:03:19.934 --> 01:03:22.955]  You can't have any sovereignty, you know, for the benefit of the people.
[01:03:22.975 --> 01:03:24.495]  And they're trying now to tell the poor.
[01:03:24.756 --> 01:03:25.876]  In fact, it's somewhere around here.
[01:03:26.036 --> 01:03:27.577]  Where did that pamphlet go I had in here?
[01:03:27.917 --> 01:03:30.698]  That CPS gave one of my employees the right to steal her eight-year-old?
[01:03:31.798 --> 01:03:32.219]  Where is it?
[01:03:32.259 --> 01:03:33.059]  Is it here in the stack?
[01:03:33.159 --> 01:03:34.660]  I wanted to show that on air sometime.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.361]  It says yelling at your child.
[01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:37.861]  They'll take them.
[01:03:38.141 --> 01:03:39.061]  There's no law.
[01:03:39.522 --> 01:03:41.422]  There's no... I mean, these people are criminals!
[01:03:41.702 --> 01:03:42.883]  But no smiling either.
[01:03:45.106 --> 01:03:47.907]  And now they're going to turn bureaucrats loose on us on our own land.
[01:03:48.067 --> 01:03:48.948]  I just can't handle it.
[01:03:49.248 --> 01:03:49.808]  I can't believe it.
[01:03:49.828 --> 01:03:52.089]  You know, you people think it's fun living in the Soviet Union.
[01:03:52.129 --> 01:03:52.909]  It's not going to be fun.
[01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.470]  Thank you for that great report.
[01:03:54.490 --> 01:03:55.770]  Tell folks the headlines so they can read it.
[01:03:55.930 --> 01:04:05.434]  Yeah, the headline again is EP, as in European Parliament, founder in 1945, the European Federation, first step towards a world federation.
[01:04:05.974 --> 01:04:07.295]  That's Zuri and Mason.
[01:04:07.335 --> 01:04:09.495]  It's on Infowars.com and all the other sites.
[01:04:09.976 --> 01:04:10.576]  Good job.
[01:04:12.897 --> 01:04:13.477]  Unbelievable.
[01:04:16.027 --> 01:04:18.588]  All right, let's go ahead and go to the calls here.
[01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:19.848]  John in Indiana.
[01:04:19.888 --> 01:04:20.908]  John, you're on the air.
[01:04:20.928 --> 01:04:21.468]  Thanks for holding.
[01:04:22.189 --> 01:04:22.509]  Alex.
[01:04:23.149 --> 01:04:23.469]  Hello.
[01:04:23.909 --> 01:04:26.910]  It is a... Oh, wow.
[01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:28.290]  I'm actually talking to Alex Jones, right?
[01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:29.671]  Come on, bro.
[01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:30.611]  I'm just an average guy.
[01:04:30.631 --> 01:04:31.231]  Find the new ruler.
[01:04:31.251 --> 01:04:31.611]  Go ahead.
[01:04:31.631 --> 01:04:32.311]  All right.
[01:04:32.371 --> 01:04:34.252]  I just want to throw a couple of things out here.
[01:04:34.292 --> 01:04:38.213]  First of all, for all truthers that want to talk to other truthers, get paltalk.com.
[01:04:41.134 --> 01:04:41.834]  Oh, I have another phone call.
[01:04:42.484 --> 01:04:45.427]  Uh, look for the room 911 Keystone to Global Police State.
[01:04:45.627 --> 01:04:47.769]  Other thing, I want to remind you about the Rainbow Gathering.
[01:04:48.169 --> 01:04:54.695]  Last year you did an interview about the pepper ball incident with the police shooting all the hippies with pepper balls.
[01:04:54.755 --> 01:04:56.457]  And I said I wanted to go to the Rainbow Gathering.
[01:04:56.497 --> 01:05:01.641]  Yeah, and I was just wondering if you plan on sending somebody out there or has it even crossed your mind?
[01:05:01.661 --> 01:05:02.822]  I know you got a lot on your mind.
[01:05:03.242 --> 01:05:03.723]  When is that?
[01:05:03.783 --> 01:05:04.564]  It's about to happen?
[01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:06.285]  July 1st through the 7th.
[01:05:06.385 --> 01:05:08.187]  It'll be somewhere near Taos, New Mexico.
[01:05:08.922 --> 01:05:13.305]  Yeah, that's why I was saying last year I might go, because that's only about eight hours from where I'm at.
[01:05:13.325 --> 01:05:15.166]  Yeah, I just wanted to remind you of it.
[01:05:15.707 --> 01:05:22.872]  And I know this is a long shot, but after the gathering, me and my girlfriend were moving to Austin, and I would volunteer to work for you free of charge, brother.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:34.345]  Well the problem is we don't, and I appreciate that, if you want to write articles or volunteer or spread the word like that, it's just we have a small operation and we turn down most volunteers because I just can't handle being infiltrated.
[01:05:34.725 --> 01:05:35.866]  And that's who they try to put in here.
[01:05:35.886 --> 01:05:37.046]  I mean, it's bad.
[01:05:37.406 --> 01:05:40.088]  They try to come in here and commit crimes and then say we did it.
[01:05:42.189 --> 01:05:44.011]  God, it's a miracle I'm not in prison already.
[01:05:45.072 --> 01:05:48.155]  And, uh, that's why I've turned down all these great people.
[01:05:48.475 --> 01:05:50.017]  Also, I can't respond to everybody's emails.
[01:05:50.057 --> 01:05:52.399]  Folks are always getting mad because I don't respond to people's emails or calls.
[01:05:52.739 --> 01:05:53.580]  I'm overwhelmed.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:54.481]  I'm not whining.
[01:05:55.662 --> 01:05:56.943]  I'm just making that statement.
[01:05:57.884 --> 01:05:59.466]  Rob Dues saying he wants volunteers.
[01:06:00.663 --> 01:06:03.124]  Yeah, but see, I kind of pick people myself.
[01:06:03.245 --> 01:06:07.507]  I go out and put a nondescript ad in and then find people.
[01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:10.829]  But the problem is everybody I end up in Austin interviewing ends up already they're listeners.
[01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:12.370]  I say we're so big.
[01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:19.254]  I mean, really, I've always tried to play down how big we are because I don't like the jealousy flaring up and people going nuts because it becomes destructive.
[01:06:19.294 --> 01:06:21.555]  But I mean, there's no point in covering it up anymore.
[01:06:21.595 --> 01:06:22.516]  We're huge, folks.
[01:06:22.576 --> 01:06:26.138]  I mean, huge and just exponentially growing.
[01:06:26.838 --> 01:06:27.639]  And I'm just...
[01:06:28.579 --> 01:06:35.423]  Thank you for taking the call.
[01:06:36.364 --> 01:06:46.010]  Yeah, I was that funny guy who was taken a picture of by your man with the little hat up in Lexington.
[01:06:46.671 --> 01:06:57.758]  Anyway, without belaboring the obvious, I think what I'm going to say is in the reign of Captain Kirk and the character that Whoopi Goldberg played, remember that?
[01:06:59.031 --> 01:07:02.953]  I didn't watch a lot of Star Trek Next Generation, but I think I remember she was in the show, yeah.
[01:07:02.973 --> 01:07:04.394]  Yeah, and she was the wise woman.
[01:07:04.414 --> 01:07:06.415]  Wasn't she like a counselor or something?
[01:07:06.875 --> 01:07:07.575]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:07.615 --> 01:07:08.616]  A fountain of wisdom?
[01:07:09.116 --> 01:07:20.542]  Could you ask your buddies, who you trust to judge, to listen to your show again and count the time that you spend belaboring the obvious.
[01:07:20.622 --> 01:07:23.643]  Now, I know you want to get the dumb downers in, too.
[01:07:25.447 --> 01:07:35.909]  Those of us who aren't in the Dom Downer crowd, which are quite a few of your listeners, would kind of appreciate it if you could just cut it a little bit so that we could get to the meat.
[01:07:36.030 --> 01:07:54.874]  Anyway, that's one of the issues, but the really important issue is I think that with Burmese on, I think what you need to fill in is to have some kind of an older, wiser woman like Nancy Levant or some interesting woman to take up the time in between your show and Burmese's show.
[01:07:55.845 --> 01:08:14.610]  And another thing is, I want to see a section on all of your sites called, In Their Own Words, and so that you could challenge people to make a case, and with money involved, put some money up there, with all the documents of these people admitting up front what they're doing.
[01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:21.052]  See, people don't believe it, but you put money down on the truth, and they're the people chasing it.
[01:08:21.587 --> 01:08:23.108]  And then they'll find out it's the truth.
[01:08:23.128 --> 01:08:24.550]  You see, this is how to get it through.
[01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:26.671]  I think we don't quite understand the methodology.
[01:08:26.932 --> 01:08:28.793]  I mean, the problem with the methodology is this.
[01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:39.042]  I did a road test, a market test, of these nice young white people who were helping at a food pantry.
[01:08:39.062 --> 01:08:46.208]  I said, how many of you have heard about the Baxter Flu release of live flu to 14, 18 countries?
[01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:49.411]  And it was caught in Czechoslovakia, and the ferrets died.
[01:08:50.202 --> 01:08:51.436]  Now this is the bad part.
[01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:57.593]  Well, they probably thought you were crazy for just being able to talk and say the word pharmaceutical.
[01:08:57.954 --> 01:09:02.537]  I mean, people think it's showing off because they have reduced the language down so much.
[01:09:02.597 --> 01:09:10.442]  They have brought in Ingsoc, as George Orwell talked about, where you try to talk to your neighbor and they kind of go, you're talking about global systems?
[01:09:10.462 --> 01:09:13.044]  You're talking about me being involved in my own destiny?
[01:09:13.404 --> 01:09:15.005]  My God, you're some type of radical!
[01:09:15.506 --> 01:09:20.189]  All I know how to do is act cool and watch football and get drunk and smoke pot.
[01:09:21.687 --> 01:09:22.687]  I have to be a slave.
[01:09:23.367 --> 01:09:25.168]  But, hey, your kid's drinking poison fluoride.
[01:09:25.188 --> 01:09:26.068]  Can't you wake up?
[01:09:26.088 --> 01:09:27.768]  They're like, no, I can't.
[01:09:28.768 --> 01:09:31.709]  So, I mean, you know, it is pretty sick, but go ahead.
[01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:38.210]  There was one person who produces PDA and said, yeah, I read this on a Bloomberg report.
[01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:41.911]  And that was the bad part.
[01:09:42.431 --> 01:09:44.331]  You know what the horrifying part was?
[01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:47.752]  Like you were talking, they didn't
[01:09:48.311 --> 01:09:49.411]  Question at all.
[01:09:49.571 --> 01:09:53.053]  I was totally freaked, but it was like being in the Alpert Hitchcock Horror Show.
[01:09:53.873 --> 01:09:54.793]  You know, it was the opposite.
[01:09:54.813 --> 01:09:55.313]  No, I know.
[01:09:55.393 --> 01:10:02.335]  I'll say, look, here's local training videos where they're taking the Austin public school kids and training them to report on their parents openly.
[01:10:02.636 --> 01:10:03.596]  This is East Germany.
[01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:06.057]  And they go, well, their parents might be bad.
[01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:08.257]  And I go, yeah, but the state's always worse.
[01:10:08.297 --> 01:10:08.758]  You can't.
[01:10:09.058 --> 01:10:11.378]  Anytime the state does this, we're in deep trouble.
[01:10:11.919 --> 01:10:12.639]  And then they're just like,
[01:10:13.703 --> 01:10:14.924]  Why don't you like police?
[01:10:15.485 --> 01:10:17.086]  And I'm just like, ahhh!
[01:10:17.386 --> 01:10:18.968]  Don't you understand, idiot?
[01:10:19.428 --> 01:10:22.130]  And now they're going, yeah, we're going to get rid of free speech in America.
[01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:24.532]  People are like, well, it was about time.
[01:10:25.593 --> 01:10:26.874]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:10:26.934 --> 01:10:31.478]  I mean, look, they've got the public mesmerized.
[01:10:31.498 --> 01:10:32.920]  We've got to break them out of their spell.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.201]  I keep talking about solutions.
[01:10:35.622 --> 01:10:36.683]  It's breaking out of your spell.
[01:10:38.888 --> 01:10:40.590]  We got rave reviews for the Obama deception.
[01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:41.892]  It's the best seller we've ever had.
[01:10:41.912 --> 01:10:45.576]  It's having a huge effect, really funding our operation, really reaching out to people.
[01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:47.298]  But I did all get a minority of people saying...
[01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:49.484]  I knew all this!
[01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:51.565]  Well, the movie isn't for you!
[01:10:52.445 --> 01:10:56.487]  It's for people that don't know the left-right paradigms control, and they play us off against each other.
[01:10:56.767 --> 01:10:59.588]  It's for people that don't know all this race stuff's meant to play us off against each other.
[01:10:59.828 --> 01:11:05.770]  It's for people that don't know the Trilateral Commission and Bilderberg Group and CFR all run the presidents from their own admissions and quotes.
[01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:07.230]  And we do have it in their own words.
[01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:14.713]  It's for people that don't understand, and it goes through how he's going to betray you, and now he has, so the film's even bigger.
[01:11:15.713 --> 01:11:18.895]  Obviously, it's not for the choir.
[01:11:19.715 --> 01:11:34.802]  Now, we do get into a lot of detailed analysis and a lot of deep stuff here, but I also... This show is successful, not because we dumb it down, but because we explain it in a historical perspective and we simplify it and then elaborate.
[01:11:35.102 --> 01:11:36.363]  Simplify and then elaborate.
[01:11:36.823 --> 01:11:38.664]  Because this is like...
[01:11:39.756 --> 01:11:43.320]  Chinese to the average American, or it's Greek, driving along in their car.
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.421]  They're like, what's he talking about?
[01:11:44.681 --> 01:11:45.482]  Corrupt government?
[01:11:45.542 --> 01:11:47.604]  I was told that didn't exist in history.
[01:11:48.265 --> 01:11:52.649]  You show him that that's all that ever has existed, he's going to get concerned and wake up.
[01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:55.792]  Or you take those that go, I know it's bad, but I can't do anything.
[01:11:56.192 --> 01:11:58.595]  You teach them that they do have power and can do something.
[01:11:59.236 --> 01:11:59.736]  Stay with us.
[01:11:59.756 --> 01:12:02.399]  More calls, tons of news, straight ahead on MSC Think, folks.
[01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:04.371]  Spring is here.
[01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:05.392]  Growing season.
[01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:07.553]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:12:07.773 --> 01:12:09.174]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:12:09.475 --> 01:12:10.155]  Think about it.
[01:12:10.455 --> 01:12:14.318]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:12:14.558 --> 01:12:18.021]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:12:18.241 --> 01:12:20.803]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:12:21.063 --> 01:12:32.932]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:12:33.152 --> 01:12:33.612]  I think so.
[01:13:02.651 --> 01:13:07.885]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:14.027]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:13:14.547 --> 01:13:20.751]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:20.971 --> 01:13:22.872]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:25.413]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:13:25.493 --> 01:13:36.379]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:39.945]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:40.325 --> 01:13:41.726]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:13:42.186 --> 01:13:48.550]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:13:57.376 --> 01:13:58.517]  The Obama Deception.
[01:13:58.937 --> 01:14:00.138]  The people strike back.
[01:14:01.735 --> 01:14:02.715]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:14:02.775 --> 01:14:07.577]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:14:07.737 --> 01:14:15.540]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:21.162]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:14:21.382 --> 01:14:28.344]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:14:28.644 --> 01:14:33.967]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:14:34.247 --> 01:14:38.969]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:14:39.309 --> 01:14:46.933]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:14:47.253 --> 01:14:53.496]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:14:53.816 --> 01:14:54.937]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:57.679 --> 01:14:58.499]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:58.539 --> 01:15:02.402]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:15:02.442 --> 01:15:07.804]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:12.667]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:15:13.067 --> 01:15:13.447]  It's true.
[01:15:13.547 --> 01:15:18.130]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:23.333]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.734]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:15:26.164 --> 01:15:30.767]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:15:30.967 --> 01:15:31.868]  And here's the best part.
[01:15:32.088 --> 01:15:34.850]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:15:35.150 --> 01:15:38.452]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:15:38.772 --> 01:15:41.614]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:15:41.954 --> 01:15:43.856]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:15:44.176 --> 01:15:45.097]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:15:45.137 --> 01:15:45.337]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:15:45.377 --> 01:15:46.437]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:15:55.273 --> 01:15:56.294]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:15:56.334 --> 01:15:56.494]  to 3 p.m.
[01:15:56.514 --> 01:15:57.134]  Central Standard Time.
[01:15:57.154 --> 01:15:58.375]  We are here live ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:58.415 --> 01:15:59.716]  Don't forget Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:15:59.736 --> 01:16:08.583]  Central Standard Time.
[01:16:22.455 --> 01:16:32.118]  We will continue to watch this North Korea situation with the truce of 56 years being broken and a state of war now effectively being in place.
[01:16:32.698 --> 01:16:35.418]  Continue to watch the destabilization of Pakistan by design.
[01:16:37.019 --> 01:16:47.242]  We will continue to watch all the different activities that are taking place with Israel and Iran, NATO manipulating and trying to start a war with Russia.
[01:16:47.322 --> 01:16:48.482]  We are in interesting times.
[01:16:49.795 --> 01:16:53.398]  GM says bondholder offer fails, bankruptcy looms.
[01:16:54.138 --> 01:17:06.367]  That's the type of news that we have here as the Feds take that over with your tax money, $19.4 billion in loans, so GM can move its main principal operations to China and Brazil.
[01:17:06.487 --> 01:17:07.228]  And that's on record.
[01:17:07.608 --> 01:17:11.290]  They are moving to China and Brazil and will manufacture what the government says.
[01:17:11.591 --> 01:17:12.491]  Talk about power!
[01:17:12.551 --> 01:17:16.955]  The few GM factories or jobs that stay here will now be dictated by the federal government.
[01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:18.436]  I mean, this is...
[01:17:20.592 --> 01:17:25.796]  This is the end, my friend, of the free republic, unless we use their attack as a way to wake people up and say no to it.
[01:17:25.816 --> 01:17:29.860]  That's why they want economic implosion, is to terrorize the public into going along with them.
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.841]  I just want to spend three or four minutes with him.
[01:17:31.861 --> 01:17:34.243]  We've got a guest popping in for ten minutes, then more of your calls.
[01:17:34.724 --> 01:17:37.306]  I wanted to bring Jim Newcomer up, because he hadn't been on in a few days with us.
[01:17:37.726 --> 01:17:40.388]  Gold has been flat at $9.559 billion.
[01:17:42.370 --> 01:17:44.610]  Sixty or so the last few days.
[01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:52.272]  It's been holding up though at that amount and they're at the very very tail end of some of that gold Ted got four weeks ago.
[01:17:52.532 --> 01:17:56.413]  Four weeks ago at the 880 level and he factors that into what he sells it.
[01:17:56.653 --> 01:18:03.914]  They're at the very end of some of the Franks, some of the Sovereigns, some of the other golds going up, but still is the best deal out there in the industry.
[01:18:04.314 --> 01:18:08.395]  They still have the silver at the insane price with those
[01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:11.056]  Franklin have dollars.
[01:18:11.096 --> 01:18:12.376]  I don't know about the Lakotas.
[01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:13.097]  I didn't ask him.
[01:18:13.477 --> 01:18:16.959]  Jim Newcomer, give us the Midas Resources specials of the day.
[01:18:17.519 --> 01:18:19.040]  Okay, Alex, I'd be glad to.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:23.863]  The $20 Liberty, the VF, the private gold, pre-$33 is at $16.27.
[01:18:24.683 --> 01:18:27.605]  The $10, that's the half-ounce coin, is at $7.99.
[01:18:28.105 --> 01:18:30.747]  We do have the Lakota Silver, but that price had to go up.
[01:18:30.927 --> 01:18:33.588]  That's at $20.50 now, or $410 a roll.
[01:18:34.969 --> 01:18:36.630]  People have still been calling in, buying it.
[01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:37.951]  Silver really offers
[01:18:38.692 --> 01:18:39.992]  A great opportunity here.
[01:18:40.713 --> 01:18:45.454]  The Franklin half dollars are at $8.80 or $176 a roll.
[01:18:45.974 --> 01:18:49.415]  Now to explain to people, that's basically what you buy them for.
[01:18:49.655 --> 01:18:52.936]  You're not going to find these anywhere near that, the way Silver's moved up.
[01:18:53.036 --> 01:18:53.316]  Still $8.80.
[01:18:54.056 --> 01:18:55.457]  How long until those run out?
[01:18:55.477 --> 01:18:57.177]  Because most of those other deals have run out.
[01:18:57.678 --> 01:19:00.398]  Well, when Ted gets back, he's going to talk to them.
[01:19:00.418 --> 01:19:04.159]  I don't know how many he secured at that price, but we did run out of the original.
[01:19:04.199 --> 01:19:06.120]  We did have to go out and acquire more.
[01:19:07.024 --> 01:19:12.667]  And our costs went up on it fairly significantly, but we're doing our best to hold these prices down so that everybody can get involved.
[01:19:13.427 --> 01:19:14.447]  It's important that they do.
[01:19:15.188 --> 01:19:16.909]  You know, you talk about the world events and things.
[01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:22.971]  This world's about to just explode here, and that's going to put a lot, a lot of pressure on the metals.
[01:19:23.691 --> 01:19:27.193]  But we do have the Sovereigns at $278.90, and the Franks at $225.90.
[01:19:27.473 --> 01:19:30.234]  They're exceptional opportunities.
[01:19:30.274 --> 01:19:31.615]  They're not going to get any cheaper.
[01:19:32.035 --> 01:19:33.796]  So, folks, give us a call here at 800-686-2237.
[01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:39.232]  If you have any questions at all, give us a call.
[01:19:39.312 --> 01:19:42.654]  We have 25 brokers here, so somebody will be here to answer your questions.
[01:19:43.275 --> 01:19:46.617]  Now, Jim Newcomer, what about the Franks and the Sovereigns?
[01:19:46.938 --> 01:19:51.641]  Am I correct in saying that we're at the very end of those special deals, or is that over too?
[01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:56.124]  Well, we did have to raise the price on those slightly, but Ted's over there in Europe now.
[01:19:56.164 --> 01:20:02.729]  He's trying to secure a supply that's going to be able to let us drop the price on it, but we won't know that until he gets back.
[01:20:02.809 --> 01:20:03.730]  But we did have to
[01:20:04.434 --> 01:20:07.236]  We did have to rate it slightly through our current supplier.
[01:20:07.796 --> 01:20:09.677]  Yeah, because you're having to buy it.
[01:20:09.717 --> 01:20:11.278]  So again, how much for the Franks?
[01:20:11.318 --> 01:20:12.138]  How much for the Sovereigns?
[01:20:12.258 --> 01:20:13.199]  Okay, the Sovereigns are at $278.90.
[01:20:13.279 --> 01:20:15.900]  That's a quarter ounce coin.
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:16.701]  The Franks are at $225.90.
[01:20:16.801 --> 01:20:18.101]  That's a fifth ounce coin.
[01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:22.531]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:32.834]  Great prices, great prices on gold, excellent prices, amazing prices on silver, especially those half dollars, those silver half dollars.
[01:20:32.854 --> 01:20:33.054]  800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.134 --> 01:20:41.576]  And you're selling those Lakotas for three, four bucks under what almost everybody else that I've seen is selling them for.
[01:20:41.936 --> 01:20:42.176]  So 800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.737 --> 01:21:03.457]  Folks, I believe in precious metals, and to me they're a hedge against inflation, they're a diversification, they're an emergency backup plan, but for people that are heavily invested in the stock market and annuities and all these things that aren't insured, or even the banks, you're really, I think, irresponsible if you don't look strongly
[01:21:03.897 --> 01:21:04.077]  Yes, sir.
[01:21:34.914 --> 01:21:35.394]  686-2237.
[01:21:35.414 --> 01:21:37.455]  I am Alex Jones.
[01:21:37.835 --> 01:21:41.897]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network in association with InfoWars.com.
[01:21:42.277 --> 01:21:44.298]  Last caller was telling me to put more shows on.
[01:21:44.318 --> 01:21:44.939]  Uh-uh.
[01:21:45.379 --> 01:21:47.320]  I don't want a radio or TV network, folks.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.022]  I got Burmess here as my doppelganger apprentice stand-in.
[01:21:52.303 --> 01:21:53.203]  We're on the march.
[01:21:53.683 --> 01:21:55.284]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:56.224 --> 01:21:58.886]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:02.156 --> 01:22:10.543]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:22:10.803 --> 01:22:15.206]  Many studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals.
[01:22:15.646 --> 01:22:20.891]  Deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.
[01:22:21.391 --> 01:22:30.338]  Go to raworganicvegansuperfoods.com today and see the wide range of foods available that are designed to help your mind and body work the way they were intended to.

[01:22:35.221 --> 01:22:36.382]  Folks, you've got to try this.
[01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:42.907]  These foods promote nutritional excellence, health and well-being, beauty enhancement, and truly sustainable agriculture.
[01:22:43.207 --> 01:22:47.070]  Many foods today have herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, and insecticides.
[01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:51.091]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:51.111 --> 01:22:54.393]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:23:15.865 --> 01:23:22.051]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:23:22.391 --> 01:23:24.273]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:26.835]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:23:26.915 --> 01:23:37.865]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:23:38.506 --> 01:23:39.787]  It's not about left or right.
[01:23:40.188 --> 01:23:41.549]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:23:42.026 --> 01:23:48.352]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:23:48.932 --> 01:23:56.700]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.341]  The Obama Deception.
[01:23:58.762 --> 01:24:00.043]  The people strike back.
[01:24:03.506 --> 01:24:04.507]  Hi, I'm Steve Shank.
[01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:08.444]  A wise man once said, if a dog ain't bitin', dogs don't bite.
[01:24:08.964 --> 01:24:12.304]  This means most people don't really believe a disaster will hit them until it does.
[01:24:12.824 --> 01:24:21.566]  The ones who truly understand self-reliance are those who've experienced the devastation of a Midwest ice storm, tornadoes, floods, or the Southeast hurricane season.
[01:24:22.226 --> 01:24:28.707]  No matter where you live in our great country, fearless independence and safety means water, food, and an evacuation plan.
[01:24:29.487 --> 01:24:31.968]  Find efoodsdirect.com on the internet.
[01:24:32.508 --> 01:24:34.368]  They have a two-month grab-and-go kit that
[01:24:36.852 --> 01:24:37.252]  I think so.
[01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:43.278]  Richard, Tori, Nick, I'm going to cram you guys into the final segment, but for one segment we've got Andrew Neil, one of the directors and producers of She Think that made the film New World Order.
[01:25:43.298 --> 01:25:45.419]  Now I don't know how much I can say on air, but it's
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:51.043]  It's one of the hottest things, well up until the hottest thing they've ever had at IFC.
[01:25:52.244 --> 01:25:53.585]  And we've seen the numbers on that.
[01:25:53.905 --> 01:25:54.626]  Very exciting.
[01:25:54.766 --> 01:25:56.948]  I knew this would give us a lot of attention, and that's the key.
[01:25:57.268 --> 01:25:59.310]  Breaking out, getting attention.
[01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:01.612]  People say, oh, well you'll be discredited by this or that.
[01:26:01.632 --> 01:26:03.693]  You know, it's a subtle film.
[01:26:03.753 --> 01:26:07.116]  I mean, there are kooky people in the alternative media movement.
[01:26:07.336 --> 01:26:10.119]  Because we're not some centralized, monolithic mainstream media.
[01:26:10.399 --> 01:26:12.441]  We're a billion different flavors.
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:19.482]  And if people think that, and I go back and forth on this, but overall it's the most positive film done by mainstream media.
[01:26:20.723 --> 01:26:22.043]  Overall it will be positive.
[01:26:23.003 --> 01:26:24.744]  Andrew and the guys were truthful with me.
[01:26:24.764 --> 01:26:27.365]  They said it's not a hit piece, but it's going to be objective.
[01:26:27.765 --> 01:26:33.907]  And now talking to them, and I remember, you know, they had folks that they could have made it look like complete lunatics, because I know who's out there.
[01:26:34.087 --> 01:26:34.847]  I know what goes on.
[01:26:35.287 --> 01:26:36.348]  I mean, if they would have wanted to.
[01:26:37.868 --> 01:26:39.409]  And they didn't do that.
[01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:46.331]  And I know that they tried to make, you know, other people tried to make fair films on Discovery Channel and things, and it got shelved with other filmmakers.
[01:26:46.971 --> 01:26:50.172]  So I know how hard it is to get something as fair as what they did on.
[01:26:50.452 --> 01:26:56.633]  A little stereotypical, and from my opinion, you know, they did focus on a little bit of the clichés, but some of that's for comic relief.
[01:26:57.093 --> 01:26:59.474]  But we do have a lot of clichés in our movement.
[01:26:59.774 --> 01:27:03.895]  But at least we're in the arena, we're taking action, we're engaged.
[01:27:04.735 --> 01:27:08.176]  And I know a lot, some folks, you know, out there,
[01:27:10.051 --> 01:27:10.913]  Have trouble dealing with that.
[01:27:10.993 --> 01:27:13.558]  Some people got confused by what I was saying.
[01:27:14.359 --> 01:27:18.206]  I'm saying Bloomberg and the New York Times and Variety and all these publications.
[01:27:18.487 --> 01:27:20.591]  The LA Times did a halfway hit piece.
[01:27:22.176 --> 01:27:29.581]  But the others came out and implied there is no Bilderberg Group, there was no fire alarm pulled by security, there weren't people following us, and there were people following us.
[01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:32.442]  Andrew Neil, one of the filmmakers who was in the van with us, can tell you that.
[01:27:32.903 --> 01:27:39.046]  And that one of his partners, Davis, was in there when the big cops were coming in saying, let's attack the State Department together.
[01:27:39.066 --> 01:27:41.628]  And he'd go, you know, my dad's a detective in Chicago.
[01:27:41.668 --> 01:27:42.648]  I know cops when I see them.
[01:27:42.668 --> 01:27:43.409]  That's an FBI guy.
[01:27:43.429 --> 01:27:45.010]  And I go, yes, I know.
[01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:47.731]  It's like telling me that's a duck swimming along in the pond right there.
[01:27:48.112 --> 01:27:48.872]  Yes, I know that.
[01:27:49.092 --> 01:27:51.414]  But the issue, I was leading the guy along, you know, talking to him.
[01:27:52.555 --> 01:28:04.865]  So, I get mad at the distortions by the media off of this, and then at the same time, I don't want to blame these filmmakers.
[01:28:04.925 --> 01:28:06.606]  I think they've had a lot of courage, and I talked to them.
[01:28:06.626 --> 01:28:07.707]  They're getting attacked by the left.
[01:28:07.987 --> 01:28:09.769]  How dare you give all these kooks this attention?
[01:28:10.069 --> 01:28:15.774]  They're getting attacked by a lot of people right now, but they're also getting huge amounts of attention, and so they've arrived as filmmakers.
[01:28:15.794 --> 01:28:18.957]  They made a lot of other award-winning films, but this one is big.
[01:28:19.457 --> 01:28:20.578]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:28:20.598 --> 01:28:25.943]  Yeah, no, I mean, a lot of what you were saying there was really salient to, like, just discussing the film right now.
[01:28:42.284 --> 01:28:51.330]  You know, of course, you know, as you know, probably better than just about anyone else, it's not, you know, it's not fun to get yammered at and yelled at and criticized and that sort of thing.
[01:28:51.390 --> 01:29:10.363]  But basically, the most important thing, in my opinion, as a filmmaker right now, is that this film is doing really well, and that, you know, this, in one month, in one month of IFC VOD, it has broken all of their records for documentaries on IFC VOD, and that's one month.
[01:29:10.883 --> 01:29:11.143]  Okay?
[01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:17.100]  That means many, many people are tuning in to watch this film, you know?
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.242]  And, you know, it's not easy to get attacked sometimes.
[01:29:21.282 --> 01:29:26.245]  You know, we're getting it from... We've got, you know, sometimes it feels like a rock and a hard place, you know?
[01:29:27.085 --> 01:29:33.649]  We've got the left saying, how dare you give these people a soapbox and let them say this kind of stuff.
[01:29:33.949 --> 01:29:37.811]  You know, I've got the right basically saying the same kind of shit.
[01:29:38.151 --> 01:29:38.771]  You know, sorry.
[01:29:39.752 --> 01:29:41.173]  Andrew, Andrew, family audience.
[01:29:43.086 --> 01:29:43.346]  I don't know.
[01:30:09.761 --> 01:30:10.882]  Yeah, well, let's get this clear.
[01:30:10.922 --> 01:30:11.683]  Let's get this clear.
[01:30:11.823 --> 01:30:14.126]  Most... America's very mentally ill right now.
[01:30:14.306 --> 01:30:17.070]  And there's always problems in society, but we're a very sick society.
[01:30:17.650 --> 01:30:24.518]  And just like Mexico or other countries that can't get it together, when I talk to people from Mexico, they say, nobody wants anybody to do well.
[01:30:24.899 --> 01:30:26.120]  It's a culture of corruption.
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:27.342]  So anytime...
[01:30:27.882 --> 01:30:33.705]  I mean, if you were to find a gold nugget at the Grand Canyon, some old lady would come up and say you were a child molester.
[01:30:34.026 --> 01:30:36.807]  You know, they don't like anybody having success, period.
[01:30:37.007 --> 01:30:39.529]  You ever gone crab fishing, you got five or six crabs in the bucket?
[01:30:39.769 --> 01:30:45.092]  They could team up and climb out together, but if any one tries to get out, the other crab comes over and grabs them.
[01:30:45.712 --> 01:30:48.914]  And the American system was always the opposite of that.
[01:30:49.535 --> 01:30:52.737]  Now we've become, like every other, backwards, decadent, sickening.
[01:30:52.997 --> 01:30:56.239]  It's a nation of spectators that have no respect for themselves.
[01:30:56.699 --> 01:30:58.900]  And so they're going to hate anyone who's an achiever.
[01:30:59.161 --> 01:31:01.702]  But the good news is, it's the record IFC film.
[01:31:01.742 --> 01:31:02.763]  The ratings have come in.
[01:31:03.063 --> 01:31:04.024]  Huge for last night.
[01:31:04.284 --> 01:31:08.246]  All-time record for the people that are watching it on demand.
[01:31:08.647 --> 01:31:09.447]  And it's huge.
[01:31:09.707 --> 01:31:11.929]  And they're going to want to do a big series with you guys now.
[01:31:13.911 --> 01:31:14.592]  You're a winner!
[01:31:14.672 --> 01:31:18.014]  Listen, they don't like the guy in pole position.
[01:31:18.594 --> 01:31:21.576]  So Andrew, you need to learn to enjoy it.
[01:31:21.916 --> 01:31:23.097]  Enjoy the jealousy.
[01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:28.801]  When somebody's jealous of me, I just get them on and go, you're right, you're so smart, I'm bad, you're the genius.
[01:31:29.201 --> 01:31:31.883]  And then everybody sees how arrogant they look.
[01:31:32.203 --> 01:31:33.244]  That's the secret.
[01:31:34.165 --> 01:31:35.586]  You're doing it for the right reason.
[01:31:35.986 --> 01:31:37.327]  You tried to make a fair film.
[01:31:37.847 --> 01:31:40.889]  I think you went with a few cliches, but you could have gone even worse.
[01:31:41.469 --> 01:31:43.591]  So again, feel good about your big victory.
[01:31:44.485 --> 01:31:47.567]  Yeah, I mean, you know, that's the one thing that you brought up that I really agree with, Alex.
[01:31:47.687 --> 01:31:53.310]  You know, like, I'm not going to get into the list of the kind of stuff that we ran into when we were making this film.
[01:31:53.710 --> 01:31:56.572]  I mean, you know, just... You told me some of the footage you've got.
[01:31:57.472 --> 01:32:00.234]  It's absolutely... You see, the people are so arrogant.
[01:32:00.254 --> 01:32:04.016]  They don't know what making fun of the Patriot movement behind their backs looks like.
[01:32:04.356 --> 01:32:07.658]  They don't know what arrogance looks like on film.
[01:32:07.898 --> 01:32:10.139]  They don't know what a favor you did them not showing it.
[01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:19.240]  Yeah, and you know, I have a few people, you know, that we film with that just blatantly are laughing about the amount of time that we spend with them and stuff like that.
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:22.381]  And that's just, it's unprofessional, childish.
[01:32:22.721 --> 01:32:35.344]  The fact of the matter is, when you shoot with people who have big egos, you know, and are complex, you know, sometimes they act like babies when they don't get put in the piece, you know?
[01:32:35.384 --> 01:32:38.085]  And that's just kind of slimy and low behavior.
[01:32:39.204 --> 01:32:42.505]  No, I just think it's unprofessional and kind of silly.
[01:32:58.332 --> 01:32:59.873]  Israel's talking about hitting Iran.
[01:32:59.973 --> 01:33:02.895]  Iran has sent battleships out to confront the U.S.
[01:33:02.995 --> 01:33:05.497]  fleet hundreds of miles away from their waters.
[01:33:05.817 --> 01:33:06.577]  That's Reuters.
[01:33:07.498 --> 01:33:09.039]  NATO is encircling Russia.
[01:33:09.139 --> 01:33:10.260]  Russia's threatening back.
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:12.501]  Russia's saying they're worried about nuclear war.
[01:33:12.841 --> 01:33:14.002]  China's on high alert.
[01:33:14.262 --> 01:33:16.043]  Japan's threatening to attack people.
[01:33:16.564 --> 01:33:24.849]  And the decadent American public and Europeans are just descending into total lunacy with one group denying there's a new world order.
[01:33:25.149 --> 01:33:27.871]  I've got people saying that you are controlling my mind with a mind control machine.
[01:33:27.911 --> 01:33:29.932]  And they're saying that this is a propaganda.
[01:33:48.317 --> 01:33:56.019]  So it's like, hold on, hold on, hold on, I'm Count Dracula, and like I'm saying, come here, Von Helsing, come here!
[01:33:56.039 --> 01:34:02.681]  And you're like, oh, you are strong-willed for one that has only lived one life.
[01:34:03.222 --> 01:34:16.866]  I was talking to your producer before we got on the show, and actually, you know, I'm a little worked up about everything, it's just too many statements, of like, you know, too many opinions.
[01:34:17.611 --> 01:34:24.574]  Well, he pointed out, and I think he's basically right, you know, if you make something to get people this riled up, then you've made something interesting.
[01:34:24.915 --> 01:34:36.680]  And in the end, you know, that is what Luke and I were trying to do, was trying to make something interesting, something objective, you know, and you're allowed to have your qualms a bit about the cliches, and people are allowed to criticize.
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:40.082]  And that's the other thing I want to say, you know, people are allowed to say they hate it.
[01:34:40.495 --> 01:34:41.676]  You know?
[01:34:41.796 --> 01:34:43.957]  That freedom of speech, you're allowed to say that.
[01:34:44.077 --> 01:34:45.238]  But Andrews, let me stop you.
[01:34:45.278 --> 01:34:47.379]  I want to be clear, and I'm going to let you make your points.
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:50.562]  I have complex emotions about it.
[01:34:51.062 --> 01:35:00.708]  I understand it's cliches, but because those really are our cliches, I know you were being kind with the stuff you didn't put in it, now that you've told me what you've got.
[01:35:00.768 --> 01:35:02.169]  My God, is it unbelievable.
[01:35:02.589 --> 01:35:06.132]  So in a way, I understand, but see,
[01:35:06.952 --> 01:35:07.472]  This is the deal.
[01:35:07.512 --> 01:35:11.733]  We're not cloistered, you know, monolithic mainstream media.
[01:35:11.993 --> 01:35:18.534]  So, of course, if you wanted to go out and pick a bunch of buffoons to represent us, you could have done that.
[01:35:18.995 --> 01:35:21.735]  And I don't think you did that to a great extent.
[01:35:21.755 --> 01:35:24.076]  You did it to somewhat of an extent.
[01:35:24.116 --> 01:35:25.156]  So I'm not blaming you.
[01:35:25.416 --> 01:35:28.857]  The issue is, we're on the verge of World War III, so what does it even matter?
[01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:30.217]  Yeah, right.
[01:35:30.317 --> 01:35:30.557]  Yeah.
[01:35:30.637 --> 01:35:33.878]  Well, you know, God, you know, I mean, excuse me.
[01:35:34.058 --> 01:35:34.398]  I don't know.
[01:35:36.071 --> 01:35:37.532]  You know, that's the thing.
[01:35:37.632 --> 01:35:41.575]  I think people tend to kind of lose perspective about stuff.
[01:35:43.116 --> 01:35:51.402]  And what's so amazing to me is when we set out to make a fair film, we make a film that's really, for all intents and purposes, a verite documentary.
[01:35:51.682 --> 01:35:59.448]  Really, I mean, when it comes down to it, it's a behind-the-scenes movie about what it's like to hang out with activist journalists in your movement.
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:03.422]  And what's amazing is that people are so stirred up, you know?
[01:36:03.642 --> 01:36:05.003]  Both the positive and the negative.
[01:36:05.023 --> 01:36:13.888]  And actually, I don't want to... I want to accentuate the positive, too, because actually, the film is a total victory right now because of the number of people who are tuning in.
[01:36:14.348 --> 01:36:15.309]  ISC's behind it.
[01:36:15.689 --> 01:36:17.010]  ISC's excited about it.
[01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:20.492]  And people are watching it, and that's the important thing.
[01:36:20.532 --> 01:36:29.377]  And actually, for all the weird, wacko email stuff, phone calls that we get, we've had people coming up to us and saying, you know what?
[01:36:29.878 --> 01:36:32.399]  We read that review, or this review, that was a great film.
[01:36:32.439 --> 01:36:33.279]  We really enjoyed it.
[01:36:33.299 --> 01:36:37.581]  And these are people who don't necessarily agree with everything that you or other people in the film have to say.
[01:36:37.901 --> 01:36:44.744]  You know, they're like, I didn't really, I cast those people off before as blackos, and I understand them now more as human beings.
[01:36:44.804 --> 01:36:48.086]  And I think that's an important thing, you know?
[01:36:48.206 --> 01:36:50.707]  I think that humanity in general,
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:59.007]  You better understand why and how people came to believe what they believe, why they believe what they believe.
[01:36:59.067 --> 01:37:08.576]  Well look, in this media universe with 10 million different frequencies of information and different ideas and different variants and niches,
[01:37:09.517 --> 01:37:22.113]  To have a big avant-garde film with top ratings on cable and going to have a huge theatrical release now and huge ratings, that is a positive thing.
[01:37:22.473 --> 01:37:26.438]  And overall, as the LA Times said, it shows myself and others as charming.
[01:37:27.519 --> 01:37:31.523]  Uh, and what's going to happen is people are then going to see the film.
[01:37:31.724 --> 01:37:33.826]  They're going to go find out about who we really are.
[01:37:34.366 --> 01:37:35.948]  Not saying you've distorted it too bad.
[01:37:35.988 --> 01:37:41.914]  The point is you have to distort something in 90 minutes because there's so much info you have to cram it down and
[01:37:42.975 --> 01:37:48.159]  And so the very nature of cutting something distorts it from its true continuum.
[01:37:48.419 --> 01:37:55.164]  So they're going to find the radio show, they're going to find InfoWars.com, they're going to find PrisonPlanet.com, and this is a positive thing.
[01:37:55.324 --> 01:38:00.547]  I learned that with real hit pieces, certified hit pieces, like the History Channel thing.
[01:38:01.428 --> 01:38:08.650]  That was so over-the-top one-sided, the mainstream media has so little credibility, that that actually got us so many new people to wake up.
[01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:29.255]  So, this is a positive victory, and it's a victory for you, and I happen to know that you guys are struggling filmmakers that have made a few hit films, but have maxed out your credit cards, and you know, literally on the edge of financial oblivion, and that you barely, barely might even get your money back on this sucker, you know, three years in the making.
[01:38:31.237 --> 01:38:33.739]  And so hold on, people are jealous.
[01:38:33.779 --> 01:38:38.024]  They think because somebody's got a hit one-time TV film that they're rich.
[01:38:38.064 --> 01:38:38.664]  They're not.
[01:38:40.146 --> 01:38:44.090]  I hope you guys do become wealthy so you can make more films, but that's not what happened.
[01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:46.553]  Again, it's a very, very sick culture.
[01:38:46.793 --> 01:38:51.518]  So Andrew, you're just having a lot of success now, so just get used to it.
[01:38:52.981 --> 01:38:58.603]  Well, you know, and the one thing you pointed out there that I think is important is, you know, I'm not saying it's the perfect movie, okay?
[01:38:58.744 --> 01:39:06.367]  In fact, in my opinion, most really great films have these little flaws that make them what they are, make them unique, you know?
[01:39:06.707 --> 01:39:07.427]  It's an impression.
[01:39:07.487 --> 01:39:12.590]  It's just a fleeting 1.5 hours of time, and you can only show so much.
[01:39:12.650 --> 01:39:17.732]  And we chose what we chose because we felt it painted an accurate impression of the people we met.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:18.440]  You know?
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:21.101]  And of course, there's all kinds of stuff that didn't make it in there.
[01:39:21.281 --> 01:39:27.303]  And we tried to be moral and fair and good to the people that we chose to show in the film.
[01:39:27.743 --> 01:39:32.685]  And really, I think for most people that see this movie, you know, they agree with that.
[01:39:32.905 --> 01:39:40.447]  And they see human beings here, not two-dimensional cardboard cutouts.
[01:39:41.028 --> 01:39:42.168]  And that's a good thing.
[01:39:42.208 --> 01:39:43.388]  That's what we set out to do.
[01:39:43.668 --> 01:39:45.429]  And I basically hope that
[01:39:46.212 --> 01:40:05.629]  In a way, like, despite, you know, me just kind of being a baby about, you know, a lot of controversy, you know, I hope that people just continue arguing and talking and thinking and looking at this movie and hopefully, you know, a dialogue will continue and people will talk about it.
[01:40:05.829 --> 01:40:06.870]  That's why I make film.
[01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:07.631]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:07.991 --> 01:40:08.932]  That's why I make film.
[01:40:09.392 --> 01:40:11.334]  And so I hope that continues.
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:13.180]  Absolutely.
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:19.082]  Well, Andrew, in a few weeks I want to get you and a couple other filmmakers here on the show and the aftermath of all this.
[01:40:19.142 --> 01:40:26.625]  The point is, most films on cable or IFC aren't in every major newspaper and in the front page of Variety.
[01:40:27.145 --> 01:40:28.505]  They know this film's important.
[01:40:28.545 --> 01:40:29.986]  That's why they're attacking your film.
[01:40:30.526 --> 01:40:31.706]  Trying to give it bad reviews.
[01:40:31.726 --> 01:40:35.827]  You've also got a lot of good reviews from the actual big film sites and the LA Times.
[01:40:36.307 --> 01:40:42.449]  And so you've made a big splash here, and that's hard to do in this huge universe of movies and films and productions.
[01:40:42.749 --> 01:40:44.869]  And so I'm just blessed that I was included in it.
[01:40:45.409 --> 01:40:51.311]  And so, you know, you called me up this morning pretty upset about what everybody's saying to you and doing.
[01:40:51.451 --> 01:40:53.691]  That's what they do, because they have no soul.
[01:40:54.052 --> 01:40:55.592]  All they have is the acts they put on.
[01:40:56.432 --> 01:41:02.356]  And they're full of a bunch of hot air and that's why they hate you is because you've got a soul and they don't have one.
[01:41:02.616 --> 01:41:04.197]  So they're a bunch of zombie ringwraiths.
[01:41:04.517 --> 01:41:05.277]  You take care, buddy.
[01:41:05.317 --> 01:41:05.798]  Good talking to you.
[01:41:05.818 --> 01:41:06.378]  Have a good weekend.
[01:41:06.398 --> 01:41:07.979]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[01:41:08.703 --> 01:41:08.963]  You bet.
[01:41:08.983 --> 01:41:10.164]  We'll see ya.
[01:41:10.184 --> 01:41:10.804]  Have a good weekend.
[01:41:10.824 --> 01:41:12.245]  I was about to take off a day or two with my kids.
[01:41:12.265 --> 01:41:14.086]  I don't know if I will now with this Korea situation.
[01:41:14.346 --> 01:41:18.989]  I'm going to come back and take a few final calls, but first I want to tell you about sponsors that make this show possible.
[01:41:19.369 --> 01:41:21.530]  One of them is New Silver Solution.
[01:41:22.290 --> 01:41:26.292]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from resistant strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?
[01:41:26.673 --> 01:41:33.436]  I want you to go to SupernaturalSilver.com today and visit their link on Infowars.com to find out more about this incredible new take on silver compound.
[01:41:33.756 --> 01:41:36.318]  The New Silver Solution is a natural antibiotic that is
[01:41:36.798 --> 01:41:40.390]  Clinically proven to kill viruses, germs, bacteria, and yeast safely.
[01:41:41.385 --> 01:41:48.410]  It is a new technology and has proven to be a formidable weapon against the bio-threats of today and tomorrow.
[01:41:48.730 --> 01:41:54.774]  The new silver solution gel has been shown to disinfect topically and keep the area sanitized for up to four hours.
[01:41:54.794 --> 01:42:00.218]  The new silver solution is a highly effective potent nanoparticle solution that is lethal to bacteria, yeast, and viruses.
[01:42:00.498 --> 01:42:03.980]  Go to supernaturalsilver.com to see the amazing line of products they have available.
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:09.984]  The new silver solution is patented and has been extensively tested to proven effectiveness and is a non-toxic to both humans and animals.
[01:42:10.364 --> 01:42:10.925]  Click on the link.
[01:42:11.845 --> 01:42:12.866]  We're good to go.
[01:42:41.445 --> 01:42:42.706]  Don't think you won't need it.
[01:42:43.287 --> 01:42:48.312]  I was talking to Andrews up in New York, where he can't have a gun to defend himself, and I said, why don't you get a Taser, buddy?
[01:42:49.093 --> 01:42:51.034]  Why don't you call Pepperspray.com?
[01:42:51.074 --> 01:42:51.655]  Pepperspray.com or 800-908-9988.
[01:42:51.675 --> 01:42:51.735]  1-800-908-9988.
[01:42:51.775 --> 01:42:53.977]  We'll be right back with a few final phone calls.
[01:42:54.077 --> 01:42:54.578]  Stay with us.
[01:43:02.395 --> 01:43:05.777]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:43:05.917 --> 01:43:11.121]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:43:11.321 --> 01:43:16.084]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:43:16.284 --> 01:43:27.252]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:43:27.532 --> 01:43:33.074]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:43:33.274 --> 01:43:39.356]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:43:39.516 --> 01:43:40.157]  What about you?
[01:43:40.377 --> 01:43:42.277]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[01:43:42.297 --> 01:43:44.978]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[01:43:46.579 --> 01:43:48.821]  Call the Berkey Guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[01:43:48.901 --> 01:43:49.221]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[01:43:49.241 --> 01:43:50.802]  Or order online by visiting us at Directive21.com.

[01:43:52.303 --> 01:43:55.045]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:08.798 --> 01:44:14.142]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:44:14.682 --> 01:44:20.867]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:44:21.207 --> 01:44:22.988]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:44:23.148 --> 01:44:25.530]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:44:25.610 --> 01:44:36.498]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:44:38.783 --> 01:44:40.064]  It's not about left or right.
[01:44:40.444 --> 01:44:41.845]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:44:42.306 --> 01:44:48.631]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:44:49.231 --> 01:44:56.997]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:57.498 --> 01:44:58.639]  The Obama Deception.
[01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:00.260]  The people strike back.
[01:45:01.732 --> 01:45:06.055]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:45:06.255 --> 01:45:08.677]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:45:08.837 --> 01:45:18.383]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:45:18.503 --> 01:45:24.407]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:45:24.707 --> 01:45:27.209]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:45:27.409 --> 01:45:29.790]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[01:45:30.851 --> 01:45:31.051]  I think so.
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:57.621]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, M.Z.
[01:45:57.661 --> 01:45:58.702]  wants to talk to you.
[01:45:58.862 --> 01:46:01.423]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:09.067]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[01:46:09.148 --> 01:46:09.928]  Nothing.
[01:46:10.048 --> 01:46:13.550]  I mean nothing, honey, if it ain't free.
[01:46:13.570 --> 01:46:17.652]  Yeah, feeling good was easy love when they sang the blues.
[01:46:17.712 --> 01:46:19.833]  You know, feeling good
[01:46:24.278 --> 01:46:24.979]  Freedom, folks!
[01:46:25.019 --> 01:46:26.900]  Just another word for nothing left to lose.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:32.464]  And when you get that attitude that you're not backing down from tyranny, you are truly free.
[01:46:35.186 --> 01:46:36.968]  Okay, let's jam in a few calls here.
[01:46:37.028 --> 01:46:37.648]  Who's up next?
[01:46:37.748 --> 01:46:40.590]  Richard in Colorado, then Torrey and Nick.
[01:46:40.610 --> 01:46:41.831]  I want to at least cram those three in.
[01:46:41.891 --> 01:46:42.732]  Richard, you're on the air.
[01:46:43.452 --> 01:46:44.753]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:46:44.913 --> 01:46:47.335]  And, you know, you're going to make a lousy cult leader.
[01:46:47.375 --> 01:46:49.517]  You keep telling people to think for themselves.
[01:46:49.697 --> 01:46:51.498]  And it's just not going to work, Alex.
[01:46:53.931 --> 01:47:01.681]  You gotta stop telling people to think for themselves, because they keep doing that and they keep finding out their own truth in life, you know?
[01:47:01.921 --> 01:47:09.591]  And I just want to say that you remind me of Sun Tzu, I believe his name was, that wrote The Art of War.
[01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:11.731]  And, uh, and Superman.
[01:47:12.091 --> 01:47:12.972]  Because... Oh, please!
[01:47:13.372 --> 01:47:13.632]  Folks!
[01:47:14.352 --> 01:47:16.334]  Look, look, actually, that stuff tortures me.
[01:47:16.394 --> 01:47:18.475]  Some people get all puffed up and everything.
[01:47:18.955 --> 01:47:23.458]  Uh, look, I'm just, I've been doing this for 14 years, so I'm good at it, I'm also bad at it.
[01:47:23.778 --> 01:47:24.779]  I got a lot of problems.
[01:47:25.199 --> 01:47:30.842]  But, look, I am good at getting people motivated to take action, but they already innately all had that in them.
[01:47:31.743 --> 01:47:38.207]  But you fight for truth, justice, and the American way, and you use the enemy's weapons against them?
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:41.561]  You strike where they are weak and you are strong.
[01:47:42.001 --> 01:47:49.604]  You aren't that guy, but you're using their techniques and their battle.
[01:47:50.524 --> 01:47:52.145]  I appreciate that Alex.
[01:47:52.165 --> 01:47:53.445]  You've got to keep doing that.
[01:47:53.566 --> 01:47:54.726]  I want to remind people
[01:47:55.325 --> 01:47:59.586]  Be a fully informed juror, go to FIJA.org.
[01:48:00.007 --> 01:48:01.567]  That's a big part of the solution.
[01:48:01.847 --> 01:48:07.209]  That's why they're trying to create their own little special courts to try their police and stuff now, just like King George III did.
[01:48:07.229 --> 01:48:10.490]  Yeah, so the fully informed jury is another way to take our power back.
[01:48:11.010 --> 01:48:11.470]  Exactly.
[01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:24.755]  My son, in fact, stopped the police from using their illegal Gestapo tactics on a member of our citizenry here in Denver by standing up on a jury and saying, hold on a second.
[01:48:25.265 --> 01:48:28.026]  It's their job to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[01:48:28.166 --> 01:48:37.209]  And did they trod on this man's constitutional rights in the pursuit of their... And you know why corrupt police hate the word Gestapo?
[01:48:37.509 --> 01:48:40.250]  That reminds people that in history, police are dangerous.
[01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:43.291]  That police have got to be controlled, just like everything else does.
[01:48:43.591 --> 01:48:44.371]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:44.391 --> 01:48:45.032]  Good to hear from you.
[01:48:45.052 --> 01:48:46.752]  Talked to you for hours, but I got everybody in there.
[01:48:47.132 --> 01:48:48.233]  Torrey in Idaho.
[01:48:48.253 --> 01:48:48.693]  You're on the air.
[01:48:49.741 --> 01:48:50.341]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:48:50.902 --> 01:48:55.163]  I actually am a younger guy, 21 years old, and I've grown up playing video games my entire life.
[01:48:55.623 --> 01:49:02.026]  I broke up about a year ago, and in retrospect, a lot of the games that I played were promoting world government and the military and stuff like that.
[01:49:02.106 --> 01:49:09.929]  But I actually played a video game just recently called Metal Gear Solid 4, and it actually had a lot of parallels with our current reality.
[01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:15.912]  It's about an alternate reality where there's a world government that's controlled by AIs,
[01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:29.506]  And those AIs have control over nanomachines that are in every single soldier and every single person, and so that the nanomachines can control all the soldiers and decide whether or not they can fire their guns and so on and so forth.
[01:49:29.787 --> 01:49:30.667]  What's the name of this game?
[01:49:31.608 --> 01:49:32.209]  Metal Gear Solid 4.
[01:49:32.369 --> 01:49:34.591]  Oh yeah, Metal Gear Solid.
[01:49:34.651 --> 01:49:35.952]  I get a lot of emails about that.
[01:49:36.992 --> 01:49:42.517]  Yeah, and it was kind of strange because it wasn't necessarily predictive programming, but it was.
[01:49:43.243 --> 01:49:44.764]  Yeah, Alex, how's it going?
[01:49:44.784 --> 01:49:50.788]  Yeah, I'm just calling, you know, because I respect everything you do and I believe everything that's going on because a lot of people are evil.
[01:50:13.487 --> 01:50:21.091]  And I try to inform my family and friends, and like Andrew said, they're trying to say that I'm being brainwashed.
[01:50:21.191 --> 01:50:27.234]  I told them when... Well, that's because they're scared of the truth and they're cowering, but in the end they're going to thank you.
[01:50:27.474 --> 01:50:28.995]  They're the ones that are brainwashed.
[01:50:29.175 --> 01:50:29.936]  What else are they doing?
[01:50:31.156 --> 01:50:33.738]  They're just telling me, you know, making fun of me.
[01:50:33.758 --> 01:50:35.619]  I'm telling them when everything hits the fan.
[01:50:35.639 --> 01:50:36.299]  Look, keep it up.
[01:50:36.359 --> 01:50:37.139]  Keep being right.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:37.980]  Keep being right.
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:38.540]  God bless you.
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:39.641]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:39.921 --> 01:50:41.682]  InfoWars.com with the Korea info.
