[00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:08.233]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:09.974]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:10.654 --> 00:00:11.775]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:13.236]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:14.876]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:19.259]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.781]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.294]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:26.374 --> 00:00:32.899]  I am Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex Jones for the first hour of this global broadcast, Thursday, August 27, 2009.
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.262]  Man, the summer is almost over.
[00:00:37.963 --> 00:00:41.025]  We're going to be hitting up this article right here, The Truth About Lying.
[00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:46.970]  Now, this is going to make a lot of people uncomfortable because it really exposes us as a society of liars, which we are.
[00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.872]  We can't even be honest with ourselves most of the time.
[00:00:50.052 --> 00:00:53.474]  We're also going to be reading this article out of Fox News, All You Need to Know.
[00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:57.097]  About the flu pandemic and the swine flu shot.
[00:00:57.117 --> 00:00:58.438]  I'm going to give you a little hint.
[00:00:58.638 --> 00:00:59.919]  Here's what you don't need to know.
[00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.540]  You don't need to know about Gillian's Bear.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.100]  It's not in there.
[00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:04.582]  You don't need to know about the trial runs that are hurting people.
[00:01:04.622 --> 00:01:06.083]  You don't need to know about Baxter.
[00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:06.864]  Okay?
[00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:10.266]  You don't need to know much other than you need to take three of these shots.
[00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:11.767]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:12.688]  But I want to make this point.
[00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:20.215]  I was on YouTube yesterday, and I noticed that the new Michael Moore movie has been up on YouTube now since August 20th.
[00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:23.476]  Now, they paid for some advertising to be on the front page.
[00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.018]  Now, I clicked on it, and it only had 32,000 views.
[00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:28.339]  Again, it had been up since the 20th.
[00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:29.359]  Six days!
[00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.803]  Now, you look at Fall of the Republic, Alex Jones' new trailer, that already has almost 70,000 views in under 48 hours.
[00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:40.384]  You look at my trailer, in under 48 hours, it has 40,000 views.
[00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:43.686]  Now why is this important?
[00:01:43.706 --> 00:01:44.466]  Why am I bringing this up?
[00:01:44.486 --> 00:01:55.752]  Number one, it shows that we are as popular, if not more popular, than a mainline leftist like Michael Moore, whose movies are literally seen by millions of people and people go to the theater to see these movies.
[00:01:56.533 --> 00:02:00.935]  Now number two, they put him on the front page for an advertisement, right?
[00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:04.777]  But they also put him in favorites and he's in the top categories.
[00:02:05.197 --> 00:02:05.998]  Okay, we're not.
[00:02:06.518 --> 00:02:09.500]  I looked at the views in the activism section, in the trailers, in the films.
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.801]  Where are we?
[00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:16.807]  We're dominating in numbers, but somehow our trailers can't get in to the top rated sites.
[00:02:16.847 --> 00:02:18.249]  We can't be on the front page.
[00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.313]  Again, why am I making this point?
[00:02:20.353 --> 00:02:25.197]  So I go to the trailer this morning, and the trailer has 300,000 hits now.
[00:02:25.237 --> 00:02:31.021]  That means it had 270,000 hits because YouTube put it on the front page.
[00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:37.566]  Can you imagine if they were fair with us, and they actually put Fall of the Republic and Invisible Empire on the front page?
[00:02:37.806 --> 00:02:40.568]  We'd easily have 300,000 views.
[00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:44.972]  And you know, I was thinking about playing this Michael Moore trailer, Capitalism, A Love Story.
[00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:49.595]  You know, it's all fun and games that they're ripping us off, and it's capitalism's fault.
[00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:51.316]  Folks, it's not capitalism's fault.
[00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:56.139]  It's the fact that we've let offshore bankers go beyond the free market.
[00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.420]  There is no free market.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.841]  This isn't a capitalist society.
[00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:02.924]  As Webster Tarpley will tell you, this is fascism at its core.
[00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:04.725]  At its hard core.
[00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:06.126]  And they're gutting it right now, baby.
[00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.588]  I mean, they are really setting up
[00:03:09.574 --> 00:03:20.420]  A society in which we have to grovel to the government to have sustenance, to maintain any kind of lifestyle where we can take care of our kids, where we can have our own home.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.261]  It won't be our home anymore, it'll really be the government's.
[00:03:23.062 --> 00:03:34.869]  And they'll just gut this country and our sovereignty, bring in the North American Union, say it's good for all of us, and we'll say, man, they temporarily fixed the problem, all of a sudden it's not 15% unemployment, it's only 10, and then it's 5.
[00:03:36.328 --> 00:03:40.831]  So we really have to be aware of this, and I like Moore on some level.
[00:03:40.912 --> 00:03:46.676]  I think Fahrenheit 9-11 woke up a lot of people, at least, to take the next step into the real hardcore 9-11 truth.
[00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:49.458]  I wasn't a huge fan of Sicko, but I didn't think it was that good.
[00:03:49.738 --> 00:03:51.019]  It just really bothers me.
[00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:56.764]  He's such a raving socialist, and really a liar at some level, Michael Moore.
[00:03:56.944 --> 00:04:00.607]  The truth about lying, we'll get to that in a moment, but he was on the cover story
[00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:04.603]  For Barack Obama on the Rolling Stone last month, right?
[00:04:04.643 --> 00:04:07.325]  Him, Gergen, and I think it was Paul Krugman.
[00:04:07.806 --> 00:04:16.853]  And he actually states in there that Obama is lying and posturing himself by saying that 50,000 troops will be in Iraq at the end of 2011.
[00:04:17.153 --> 00:04:19.275]  He doesn't believe that he's telling the truth.
[00:04:19.315 --> 00:04:20.396]  He really thinks he's gonna get them out.
[00:04:21.215 --> 00:04:22.856]  Are you insane, Michael Moore?
[00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:24.238]  Of course that's the plan!
[00:04:24.538 --> 00:04:27.801]  We'll be lucky to only have 50,000 troops in Iraq by the end of 2011.
[00:04:27.921 --> 00:04:30.003]  Okay?
[00:04:30.343 --> 00:04:31.684]  Let's be real with each other.
[00:04:31.944 --> 00:04:35.447]  They're saying they need to beefcake up the Afghan war.
[00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:36.989]  That's the reality.
[00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.493]  And you're going to be hearing a lot of that rhetoric in the run-up to September 11th and on September 11th this year.
[00:04:42.634 --> 00:04:43.594]  I guarantee you that.
[00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:45.276]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:45.296 --> 00:04:46.278]  I'm Jason Burmas sitting in.
[00:04:46.378 --> 00:04:51.945]  Alex coming up in the second, third, and fourth hours with Wayne Paul, Dr. Lebeau, General Stubblebine, and Bob Cohen.
[00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:55.530]  Go check us out over at InfoWars.com and we're streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.911]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:05:04.192 --> 00:05:05.974]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:05:06.174 --> 00:05:06.875]  Well, you should.
[00:05:07.155 --> 00:05:11.400]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.141]  That's right.
[00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:20.931]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:22.372]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:22.492 --> 00:05:23.634]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:05:23.814 --> 00:05:29.457]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:05:29.798 --> 00:05:36.322]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:41.885]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:43.365]  This is real.
[00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:44.426]  Don't miss out.
[00:05:44.726 --> 00:05:53.109]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.470]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.151]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:02.332]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[00:06:03.953 --> 00:06:05.373]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:05.393 --> 00:06:07.454]  A new world order.
[00:06:08.203 --> 00:06:12.646]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[00:06:13.086 --> 00:06:15.888]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:15.928 --> 00:06:18.170]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.172]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:21.892 --> 00:06:29.217]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:32.233 --> 00:06:37.215]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:37.675 --> 00:06:41.156]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:41.556 --> 00:06:44.037]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:44.117 --> 00:06:45.077]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:45.097 --> 00:06:46.037]  They're not after money.
[00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:47.138]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:47.338 --> 00:06:48.058]  They're after power.
[00:06:48.318 --> 00:06:49.439]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:06:57.941 --> 00:07:00.502]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:07:01.002 --> 00:07:02.184]  You have been warned.
[00:07:03.125 --> 00:07:06.148]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:07:06.508 --> 00:07:10.132]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:07:10.412 --> 00:07:13.876]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:22.926]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[00:07:23.146 --> 00:07:28.948]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[00:07:57.246 --> 00:07:57.806]  Big Brother.
[00:07:57.966 --> 00:07:58.827]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.231]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:13.712]  You want answers?
[00:08:14.472 --> 00:08:15.393]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:16.053 --> 00:08:19.635]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:24.318]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.558 --> 00:08:26.299]  All right, folks, we are back.
[00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:27.160]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.081]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in for the first hour.
[00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:32.463]  Alex coming in up in the second, third, fourth hours.
[00:08:33.003 --> 00:08:35.845]  I'm holding in my hand last month's Rolling Stone, and then we're going to
[00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:41.490]  Finish up with this Michael Moore issue and move on to the H1N1 vaccine, but it's not really H1N1.
[00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:42.952]  Again, this is three types of flu.
[00:08:43.593 --> 00:08:44.093]  So here it is.
[00:08:44.573 --> 00:08:51.160]  Obama so far in the cover image here, if we can focus in on this on PrisonPlanet.TV, is by Shepard Fairey.
[00:08:53.558 --> 00:08:54.138]  It's right here.
[00:08:54.418 --> 00:08:56.899]  It's his follow-up to his iconic hope image.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:05.723]  Now when you open it up, you know, it's this big article with David Bohemian Grove Club, Gergen and Paul Krugman and Michael Moore, Obama so far.
[00:09:05.783 --> 00:09:06.604]  There he is right here.
[00:09:07.104 --> 00:09:13.127]  And he really has the nerve to say, he fakes right and goes left, says Moore.
[00:09:13.287 --> 00:09:16.268]  I'll be shocked if he keeps 50,000 troops in Iraq.
[00:09:16.548 --> 00:09:19.749]  He just says those things to keep the opposition at
[00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.370]  And speaking of Obama...
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.483]  We got a story up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv right now about this censored image.
[00:09:50.543 --> 00:09:56.806]  At first they said, hey, the artist of this Obama Joker filed a DMCA complaint.
[00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:57.326]  He did not.
[00:09:58.446 --> 00:09:59.867]  And then they said Time Magazine did it.
[00:10:00.587 --> 00:10:01.328]  No, they didn't either.
[00:10:02.448 --> 00:10:04.229]  Okay, so who is doing this?
[00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:05.750]  Flickr won't say.
[00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.250]  Check it out.
[00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:10.043]  You'll remember that the image caused all uproar.
[00:10:10.103 --> 00:10:18.089]  Here's a list of most places where the story ran last week after Flickr was reported to have removed the controversial image from Al-Khalid's stream and their site.
[00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:34.763]  Flickr's defense of their removal of the image eventually came from Community Manager Health Camp in a help forum thread that has subsequently been shut down, who told Flickr users that the reason why the image was removed was that someone filed a DMCA request to take it down.
[00:10:36.405 --> 00:10:39.807]  In this instance, the Yahoo copyright team here is the U.S.
[00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:53.935]  received a complete notice of infringement as outlined by DMCA, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, stated CHAMP trying to deflect blame for the deletion of the controversial law, or deletion on the controversial law.
[00:10:54.155 --> 00:10:56.897]  Now again, Time Magazine would have nothing here.
[00:10:57.097 --> 00:11:04.001]  Larry Flint of Hustler Magazine fought in court, I think it was either in the 70s or 80s, to do these type of parodies.
[00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:10.363]  Now, granted, his are a bit dirtier, but he said, look, this is free speech.
[00:11:10.743 --> 00:11:12.403]  This is political.
[00:11:12.643 --> 00:11:13.624]  I have a right to do this.
[00:11:13.664 --> 00:11:15.164]  And obviously, that's what this is.
[00:11:15.484 --> 00:11:18.625]  This image looks nothing like the actual Time image.
[00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:20.166]  It has been altered beyond belief.
[00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:27.628]  So this guy, like I said, unless the actual creator of the piece here, of the Joker piece, filed that complaint, they haven't.
[00:11:27.828 --> 00:11:31.709]  Even if Time Magazine had filed the complaint, which they're saying in this article, they didn't.
[00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:32.872]  They didn't.
[00:11:33.413 --> 00:11:34.474]  It wouldn't hold up in court.
[00:11:34.854 --> 00:11:36.095]  It's an original image, folks.
[00:11:36.575 --> 00:11:37.736]  So the mystery continues.
[00:11:37.776 --> 00:11:38.757]  Why are they tearing this down?
[00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:47.063]  Because it's gone viral and it shows our Lord and Savior, the Messiah, Barack Obama, in a bad light and they can't have that.
[00:11:48.424 --> 00:11:49.345]  Alright, so here it is.
[00:11:50.146 --> 00:11:52.808]  Everything you need to know about the H1N1 vaccine.
[00:11:54.557 --> 00:11:55.377]  Take a look at it, folks.
[00:11:55.417 --> 00:11:57.678]  I mean, this is pure propaganda from Fox News.
[00:11:57.738 --> 00:12:00.019]  It's the follow-up propaganda from Fox News.
[00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:09.303]  See, they're allowed to expose, you know, what's going on in Wall Street and how bad the Democrats are with health care, now that they're in the minority.
[00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:14.465]  But they still have to push the globalist propaganda that you need to take your shot.
[00:12:14.725 --> 00:12:16.786]  There's not going to be one mention in this article
[00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:19.368]  About people becoming quadriplegics.
[00:12:19.568 --> 00:12:24.072]  There's not going to be one mention in this article about people dying from the vaccine.
[00:12:24.392 --> 00:12:25.774]  Not one mention of what happened in 1976.
[00:12:25.834 --> 00:12:28.976]  Not one mention.
[00:12:29.597 --> 00:12:33.601]  Not one mention of the trial runs that are hurting people.
[00:12:34.398 --> 00:12:45.963]  Safety questions are being raised about the rush to get an H1N1 vaccine into the hands of doctors before the virus re-emerges this fall, possibly more dangerous and widespread than it was last spring.
[00:12:46.243 --> 00:12:48.504]  So they're already spooking you out in the first paragraph.
[00:12:48.564 --> 00:12:50.725]  It's going to be more dangerous, more widespread.
[00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:51.726]  Here it comes.
[00:12:52.546 --> 00:12:57.212]  And those questions are brewing concern among many Americans wondering whether to risk putting off being vaccinated.
[00:12:57.272 --> 00:12:57.452]  See?
[00:12:57.792 --> 00:13:00.435]  Whether to risk putting off being vaccinated.
[00:13:00.676 --> 00:13:03.779]  They're making it seem like you need to rush to go get it.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.581]  Not whether or not you should take it.
[00:13:05.802 --> 00:13:06.883]  Whether you should put it off.
[00:13:06.963 --> 00:13:08.225]  No, you're going to take the shot.
[00:13:09.066 --> 00:13:12.550]  Or take a shot at beating the bug before it gains the upper hand.
[00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:16.241]  And then it has your H1N1 survival guide.
[00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:27.707]  They're pushing it as fast as they can, but they still have to meet good manufacturing standards, said Dr. Peter Gross, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Hackensack University Medical Center.
[00:13:27.947 --> 00:13:29.668]  You should be ashamed of yourself, Mr. Gross.
[00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:35.712]  It will be tested to make sure it's safe and contains the proper amount of protective antibodies.
[00:13:36.172 --> 00:13:39.634]  Meanwhile, they're jacking it up with mercury, already admitted, squalene.
[00:13:40.235 --> 00:13:46.498]  The mercury, by the way, they actually say they're going to make some mercury-free ones for some of the children and the pregnant women that are taking it.
[00:13:46.778 --> 00:13:49.960]  Meanwhile, they're the target audience, and they're the first people that are going to vaccinate.
[00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:55.704]  So unless 100% of this vaccine is mercury-free, think about how many people they're going to give it to anyway.
[00:13:56.404 --> 00:13:57.665]  It's all semantic games.
[00:13:57.765 --> 00:13:58.566]  It's all lies.
[00:13:58.666 --> 00:14:02.248]  It's a culture of liars, and we love it that they lie to us.
[00:14:02.268 --> 00:14:03.929]  We're going to get to that article because it's so important.
[00:14:04.449 --> 00:14:08.572]  I just went over it this morning and I was like, you know, this really does tell it like it is.
[00:14:09.272 --> 00:14:12.454]  This really says what we are as a society.
[00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:14.075]  Where our morals are.
[00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:15.436]  And I'm not perfect.
[00:14:15.516 --> 00:14:15.977]  I know that.
[00:14:16.457 --> 00:14:17.418]  I'm far from perfect.
[00:14:18.638 --> 00:14:19.719]  I'm going to continue with this article.
[00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:20.580]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.621]  Each year, scientists with the FDA, U.S.
[00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:32.988]  Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health and Vaccine Manufacturers meet in January or February to decide which strains of the flu virus will be included in the seasonal flu vaccine.
[00:14:34.605 --> 00:14:41.908]  From there, the chosen strains are sent to the World Health Organization so that scientists can view the selected strains and make any necessary, though usually minor, changes.
[00:14:42.808 --> 00:14:48.490]  Meanwhile, no mention in this article, zero mention, that it's H5N1, the bird flu virus.
[00:14:49.311 --> 00:14:54.052]  Two separate strains of H1N1, the pig flu virus, and one strain of human flu virus.
[00:14:54.233 --> 00:14:55.493]  They're not mentioning that at all.
[00:14:55.573 --> 00:14:57.674]  They say, well, this is nothing new.
[00:14:58.789 --> 00:14:59.869]  And here's where they admit, though.
[00:14:59.969 --> 00:15:05.831]  The new virus, however, is different in that it contains a mix of human, bird, and swine flu strains of the virus.
[00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:09.072]  Just casually saying it, no big deal.
[00:15:09.092 --> 00:15:11.153]  And you're thinking to yourself, wait a minute, bird flu?
[00:15:11.213 --> 00:15:12.173]  Isn't that more deadly?
[00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:14.734]  How does bird flu get in there?
[00:15:15.234 --> 00:15:24.697]  And again, it's lightly and sparsely mentioned in the media, but they never focus on that because then they have to focus on the fact that this was probably created in a bioweapons lab.
[00:15:25.357 --> 00:15:27.198]  And people have gone public saying that.
[00:15:28.228 --> 00:15:30.670]  I think it was one of the guys that designed Tamiflu said that.
[00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.991]  I mean, come on!
[00:15:33.131 --> 00:15:34.712]  Only when he said it, though, it escaped.
[00:15:34.752 --> 00:15:36.173]  It mistakenly escaped.
[00:15:36.213 --> 00:15:38.635]  See, there's no way they would actually release it on purpose.
[00:15:38.675 --> 00:15:45.079]  You say that, like the health minister out in India, all of a sudden you're saying that the government and the Jews did it!
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.122]  At least that's the CFR propaganda that we saw in the Colbert Report.
[00:15:50.303 --> 00:15:54.966]  Let's see, an H1N1 strain has been included in the influenza vaccine every year since 1977.
[00:15:57.281 --> 00:16:08.573]  And they're also saying that the process is a slow one, so they're not going to be able to give everybody it off the bat, but they're still, again, hitting the 20 to 40 year olds first, pregnant women, and very young children.
[00:16:08.613 --> 00:16:15.341]  See, they figure that the older people are just going to catch it from all the people they infect when they give them the shot.
[00:16:16.262 --> 00:16:17.083]  That's a sick joke!
[00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:20.475]  And then at the very end, it's three shots instead of one.
[00:16:20.715 --> 00:16:28.087]  Americans are potentially looking at three flu shots this year instead of the normal one shot that would include one of the seasonal flu.
[00:16:28.568 --> 00:16:28.828]  Alright.
[00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:33.696]  So I'm already getting Board of Education permission slips.
[00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:40.842]  Now this one is a lot more honest than some of the ones you're probably going to see for those of you out there that have children.
[00:16:41.342 --> 00:16:45.565]  Okay, obviously we have the school systems blacked out and whatnot, but here it is right here.
[00:16:45.825 --> 00:16:48.047]  The flu season is expected to be active.
[00:16:48.447 --> 00:16:56.514]  With the threat of H1N1 virus, swine flu, and the seasonal flu, it is especially important that all families take precautions to avoid getting sick.
[00:16:57.922 --> 00:16:58.382]  Let's see.
[00:16:59.123 --> 00:17:10.050]  Blank Hospital of Blank plans to provide free seasonal flu injections and flu mist to all school students as well as all school staff in early November.
[00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.051]  So this is going to be free, folks!
[00:17:13.472 --> 00:17:14.973]  They're pumping it out free style.
[00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:16.354]  In fact, we read the story yesterday.
[00:17:16.374 --> 00:17:19.195]  They're willing to pay you $50 in some places to take this shot.
[00:17:20.076 --> 00:17:24.879]  The Blank Schools Coordinated School Health Program and the school nurse are working with the health department
[00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:32.310]  To make available an H1N1 vaccination at no cost to all students and staff.
[00:17:33.356 --> 00:17:38.098]  The H1N1 vaccine will be given in two doses at least three weeks apart.
[00:17:38.118 --> 00:17:41.820]  So they're already talking about, in this permission slip, two shots off the bat.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.901]  A two spot.
[00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:49.324]  For planning purposes, it is important to have an idea of how many students will have parent permission to receive the immunizations.
[00:17:49.464 --> 00:17:52.705]  No child will receive an immunization without parent permission.
[00:17:52.985 --> 00:17:57.888]  So this is one of the better permission slips that I've seen, but this shows their intent.
[00:17:59.305 --> 00:17:59.926]  I will say this.
[00:18:00.006 --> 00:18:01.567]  This is not fear-mongering.
[00:18:01.607 --> 00:18:03.989]  This is not saying kids won't be able to go to school.
[00:18:04.309 --> 00:18:07.612]  This is saying that they are not going to get the immunization without permission.
[00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:13.096]  Look for a lot more of these coming up and look for them to be a lot more deceptive.
[00:18:14.488 --> 00:18:15.288]  Then this one right here.
[00:18:16.229 --> 00:18:17.089]  Now check this one out.
[00:18:17.169 --> 00:18:20.771]  Company cleared to test swine flu vaccine fighting off liquidation.
[00:18:21.051 --> 00:18:28.354]  Okay, so the guys that are testing the swine flu vaccine right now are just clawing to stay above water and make a profit.
[00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:34.437]  Gee, do you think that they're going to rush through these tests and say whatever the establishment wants them to so they can stay in business?
[00:18:35.345 --> 00:18:35.825]  I wonder.
[00:18:36.146 --> 00:18:37.586]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal, by the way.
[00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:41.909]  As a new White House report raises the possibility that up to 50% of the U.S.
[00:18:41.949 --> 00:18:44.891]  population could contract swine flu this season.
[00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:44.891]  50%!
[00:18:46.252 --> 00:18:48.794]  These people are insane!
[00:18:49.864 --> 00:18:53.406]  One drug maker has come a step closer to distributing a vaccine.
[00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:57.608]  That is, if the involuntary bankruptcy filing against it doesn't get in the way.
[00:18:57.708 --> 00:19:09.293]  Protein Sciences Corporation of Meridian, Connecticut is a privately held vaccine maker that last week won federal approval to kick off clinical trials of its vaccine for the H1N1 or swine flu virus.
[00:19:09.613 --> 00:19:11.374]  The Hartford Courant reported,
[00:19:12.254 --> 00:19:17.235]  That means Protein Scientist's PanBlock vaccine will be tested on humans as soon as the next few weeks.
[00:19:17.255 --> 00:19:21.456]  Such trials have already started in Australia, where winter and flu season are underway.
[00:19:21.776 --> 00:19:26.097]  The FDA stamp of approval doesn't mean it will be smooth sailing for Protein Scientist.
[00:19:26.137 --> 00:19:34.279]  However, the company was hit with an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing last month by three creditors owed $11.7 million.
[00:19:37.421 --> 00:19:39.824]  So again, these guys need to keep their head above water.
[00:19:39.864 --> 00:19:41.165]  The creditors want their money.
[00:19:41.485 --> 00:19:44.949]  They'll do whatever the establishment says.
[00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.811]  Roll up your sleeves, folks.
[00:19:47.212 --> 00:19:50.035]  Take the poison injection.
[00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.076]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:51.096 --> 00:19:57.083]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and don't forget TruthNews.us.
[00:20:03.581 --> 00:20:04.842]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:04.882 --> 00:20:10.228]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:20:10.468 --> 00:20:15.113]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:20:15.493 --> 00:20:20.539]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:20:21.059 --> 00:20:25.762]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:20:26.283 --> 00:20:33.208]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:20:33.408 --> 00:20:34.308]  And here's the best part.
[00:20:34.509 --> 00:20:40.853]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:20:41.193 --> 00:20:44.035]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:44.375 --> 00:20:46.276]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:46.596 --> 00:20:47.937]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:20:49.858 --> 00:20:51.859]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:59.924]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:21:00.244 --> 00:21:02.686]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:21:04.027 --> 00:21:09.250]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:09.813 --> 00:21:17.098]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:17.398 --> 00:21:23.582]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:23.922 --> 00:21:25.804]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:25.944 --> 00:21:28.365]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:21:28.465 --> 00:21:39.433]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:40.033 --> 00:21:41.314]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:41.695 --> 00:21:43.076]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:43.557 --> 00:21:49.943]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:21:50.443 --> 00:21:58.211]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:58.671 --> 00:21:59.872]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:01.434]  The people strike back.
[00:22:04.161 --> 00:22:06.102]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:22:06.383 --> 00:22:09.004]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:22:09.325 --> 00:22:17.611]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:22:17.911 --> 00:22:20.273]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:22:21.573 --> 00:22:24.796]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:27.718]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:22:28.098 --> 00:22:29.059]  Take action now.
[00:22:29.159 --> 00:22:33.043]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:22:33.964 --> 00:22:37.727]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:22:37.947 --> 00:22:41.170]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.012]  Current Federal Reserve policy and
[00:22:43.192 --> 00:22:47.736]  Uncontrolled government spending has set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:22:48.016 --> 00:22:53.300]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.

[00:24:17.592 --> 00:24:18.252]  We are back.
[00:24:18.272 --> 00:24:19.112]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:19.132 --> 00:24:20.293]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in.
[00:24:21.473 --> 00:24:27.674]  Alex coming up in the second, third, and fourth hours with Wayne Paul, Dr. LeBeau, General Stubblebine, and Bob Cohen.
[00:24:27.694 --> 00:24:32.235]  I want to take this quick second to thank one of our great sponsors.
[00:24:32.275 --> 00:24:34.095]  They're what makes this show possible.
[00:24:34.215 --> 00:24:35.475]  Ecoloblue.com.
[00:24:35.495 --> 00:24:37.496]  That's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[00:24:37.756 --> 00:24:38.956]  You can call them at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:24:38.996 --> 00:24:40.236]  Folks, it's the best purified water maker.
[00:24:45.897 --> 00:24:46.778]  Out there, in my opinion.
[00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:50.343]  I mean, you don't even need to plug this up to a sink, a faucet at all.
[00:24:50.844 --> 00:24:52.906]  It pulls water from the air.
[00:24:53.973 --> 00:24:55.174]  The truth about lying.
[00:24:55.274 --> 00:24:56.234]  We are a culture of liars.
[00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:58.195]  But he doesn't say maybe we should clean up our act.
[00:24:58.215 --> 00:24:58.935]  What does he say?
[00:24:58.975 --> 00:25:01.517]  Maybe we'd all benefit from brushing up on our skills.
[00:25:17.153 --> 00:25:21.157]  It's meant to be funny, but it's also a more serious commentary on us all.
[00:25:21.437 --> 00:25:23.939]  As Americans, we like to think we value the truth.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:31.547]  Time and time again, public opinion polls show that honesty is among the top five characteristics we want in a leader, friend, or lover.
[00:25:32.468 --> 00:25:36.311]  The world is full of woeful stories about tragic consequences of betrayal.
[00:25:37.552 --> 00:25:40.915]  At the same time, deception is all around us.
[00:25:41.963 --> 00:25:47.432]  We are lied to by the government and its officials and public figures to a disturbing degree.
[00:25:47.692 --> 00:25:51.598]  Many of our social relationships are based on little white lies we tell each other.
[00:25:52.119 --> 00:25:53.200]  So far this guy's spot on.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.622]  We deceive our children, only to be deceived by them in return.
[00:25:58.142 --> 00:26:08.208]  And the average person, says psychologist Robert Friedman, the author of a new book on lying, tells us at least three lies in the first ten minutes of our conversation.
[00:26:08.948 --> 00:26:13.731]  There's always been a lot of lying, says Feldman, whose new book, The Liar in Your Life, came out this month.
[00:26:14.131 --> 00:26:21.896]  But I do think we're seeing a kind of cultural shift where we're lying more, it's easier to lie, and in some ways it's almost more acceptable.
[00:26:23.539 --> 00:26:40.992]  Let's see, as Paul Elkman, one of Feldman's longtime lying colleagues, and the inspiration behind Fox TV's Lie to Me, that's the one with Tim Roth, he defines a liar as a person who intends to mislead deliberately without being asked to do so by a target of the lie, which doesn't mean that all lies are equally toxic.
[00:26:41.293 --> 00:26:43.735]  Some are simply habitual, like my pleasure.
[00:26:44.958 --> 00:26:50.222]  Uh, while others might be altruistic, but each Feldman argues is harmful because of the standard it creates.
[00:26:50.262 --> 00:26:50.603]  Correct.
[00:26:50.803 --> 00:26:56.968]  And the more lies we tell, even if they're little white lies, the more deceptive we, as a society, become.
[00:26:57.868 --> 00:27:04.814]  We are a culture of liars, to put it blatantly, with deceit so deeply ingrained in our psyches that we hardly even notice we're engaging in it.
[00:27:05.975 --> 00:27:09.698]  Spam email, deceptive advertising, the everyday pleasantries we don't really mean.
[00:27:09.958 --> 00:27:11.279]  Oh, it's so great to meet you!
[00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:12.160]  I love that dress!
[00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:15.352]  Have become an omnipresent white noise.
[00:27:15.593 --> 00:27:17.433]  We've learned to tune out.
[00:27:17.813 --> 00:27:18.193]  It's true.
[00:27:18.233 --> 00:27:19.233]  We're disingenuous.
[00:27:19.433 --> 00:27:20.794]  We lie to ourselves every day.
[00:27:20.834 --> 00:27:22.014]  We think things are going to get better.
[00:27:22.234 --> 00:27:27.556]  I mean, when you see quotes like this, Oh, I think Obama's faking right and ready to go left.
[00:27:28.256 --> 00:27:30.376]  I'll be shocked if he keeps 50,000 troops in there.
[00:27:30.396 --> 00:27:31.477]  Are you lying to yourself?
[00:27:31.557 --> 00:27:32.277]  Are you lying to us?
[00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:32.797]  Are you lying?
[00:27:33.925 --> 00:27:37.667]  To both, Mr. Moore, because that is just utterly ridiculous.
[00:27:37.967 --> 00:27:45.832]  He goes on through this whole thing to talk about the modern world, how we loved Bill Clinton and other politicians like them, and honestly, they are liars.
[00:27:46.692 --> 00:27:54.177]  But again, the author of the book says it's detrimental, but the author of this article says, hey, whatever, we need to just brush up on it.
[00:27:54.197 --> 00:28:00.921]  They also talk about Spitzer and Mark Sanford, the guy who just got caught with that woman out in Argentina.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:10.043]  But what's really detrimental, not those small things, that we're lying to ourselves that this health care bill, you know, isn't that dangerous.
[00:28:10.123 --> 00:28:12.264]  Sure, there are town hall meetings, but what's in the backdrop?
[00:28:12.945 --> 00:28:17.586]  Well, the cap and trade is in the backdrop, and that's already gone through Congress.
[00:28:17.687 --> 00:28:20.348]  This climate bill that's going to end up costing us even more money.
[00:28:20.628 --> 00:28:23.369]  Yes, the health bill may cost us our lives in the end,
[00:28:24.451 --> 00:28:30.742]  But what kind of a life are we going to have when our electric bills go up four times and we're not allowed to have two cars per family?
[00:28:31.022 --> 00:28:34.468]  And they start putting restrictions on the amount of children we're able to have.
[00:28:34.969 --> 00:28:37.693]  And they start charging us to send our children to school if it's too many.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.460]  What happens then?
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.121]  I mean, that's what we're lying to ourselves about.
[00:28:42.141 --> 00:28:44.501]  We're lying to ourselves that Ted Kennedy was a great man.
[00:28:44.741 --> 00:28:45.722]  He was not a great man.
[00:28:46.182 --> 00:28:50.323]  And by the way, as I predicted yesterday, this garbage is everywhere.
[00:28:50.363 --> 00:28:51.863]  It's even on the infotainment channels.
[00:28:52.203 --> 00:28:54.844]  I'm up at like 2 or 3 in the morning sometimes, last night.
[00:28:55.284 --> 00:29:00.645]  You know, I'm clicking through the stations, and all I get is what the antenna gets, so I get the main three and some other ones.
[00:29:01.405 --> 00:29:03.306]  So, you know, I'm watching the Hollywood Insider.
[00:29:04.451 --> 00:29:05.293]  Ted Kennedy's there.
[00:29:05.633 --> 00:29:07.036]  I'm watching Entertainment Tonight.
[00:29:07.076 --> 00:29:07.957]  Ted Kennedy's there.
[00:29:08.378 --> 00:29:14.509]  And it's like Ted Kennedy on a yacht and he championed all these workers' rights and I have to hear about No Child Left Behind.
[00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.132]  It's all garbage!
[00:29:16.372 --> 00:29:17.454]  Head Start program.
[00:29:18.991 --> 00:29:24.355]  Look, like I said yesterday, and I forgot to mention that his nephew got killed as well.
[00:29:24.635 --> 00:29:27.437]  Let's face it, JFK Jr., his death stinks as well.
[00:29:27.617 --> 00:29:29.018]  And he didn't step up then either.
[00:29:29.038 --> 00:29:31.099]  He didn't step up on his deathbed.
[00:29:31.599 --> 00:29:33.661]  He didn't call out the criminals that killed his family.
[00:29:34.281 --> 00:29:39.465]  So again, I got no love for him, and now the establishment is using his death to try to promote this health reform.
[00:29:39.545 --> 00:29:40.666]  Oh, we had brain cancer.
[00:29:40.706 --> 00:29:43.608]  If we caught it early enough with this new health bill, everything would be okay.
[00:29:44.068 --> 00:29:44.988]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:45.008 --> 00:29:47.910]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:54.352 --> 00:29:57.313]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:58.253 --> 00:30:01.014]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.975 --> 00:30:07.997]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:30:08.197 --> 00:30:11.998]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:12.218 --> 00:30:17.840]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:22.982]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:23.182 --> 00:30:23.642]  Number three,
[00:30:24.102 --> 00:30:29.566]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:30:30.387 --> 00:30:33.049]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:37.513]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:37.813 --> 00:30:41.456]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.676 --> 00:30:47.160]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long-time sponsor of ours.
[00:30:47.401 --> 00:30:50.503]  You can get more information at www.solutionsfromscience.com.
[00:30:50.563 --> 00:30:51.944]  MySolarBackup.com.
[00:30:52.084 --> 00:30:53.625]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:30:53.865 --> 00:30:56.187]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[00:30:56.427 --> 00:30:59.069]  So go to MySolarBackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:31:04.304 --> 00:31:09.585]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:10.286 --> 00:31:15.587]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:16.127 --> 00:31:22.229]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:22.569 --> 00:31:24.391]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:24.531 --> 00:31:26.934]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:26.994 --> 00:31:37.926]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:40.211 --> 00:31:41.431]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:41.851 --> 00:31:43.252]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:43.712 --> 00:31:50.033]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:50.613 --> 00:31:58.395]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:00.016]  The Obama Deception.
[00:32:00.456 --> 00:32:01.636]  The people strike back.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.502]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:32:07.722 --> 00:32:10.123]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:32:10.283 --> 00:32:19.828]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:32:19.948 --> 00:32:25.851]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:32:26.151 --> 00:32:28.612]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:32:28.852 --> 00:32:38.576]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[00:32:38.976 --> 00:32:49.381]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:53.482]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[00:32:53.562 --> 00:32:54.763]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[00:32:55.063 --> 00:32:56.386]  OwnMyself.com.
[00:32:56.546 --> 00:33:00.134]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[00:33:00.334 --> 00:33:02.819]  Remember, Chocolate.OwnMyself.com.
[00:33:24.113 --> 00:33:25.094]  Alright folks, we are back.
[00:33:25.154 --> 00:33:25.934]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.995 --> 00:33:28.016]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in for the first hour.
[00:33:28.557 --> 00:33:30.458]  Alex coming up in the second, third, and fourth hours.
[00:33:31.759 --> 00:33:33.781]  You know, this is a really important one to cover.
[00:33:33.821 --> 00:33:36.042]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:33:37.143 --> 00:33:40.146]  Agency that insures bank deposits may need help.
[00:33:40.186 --> 00:33:41.987]  This is the state of denial that we're in.
[00:33:42.287 --> 00:33:46.931]  We'll allow someone like Timothy Geithner to sit up there and say, no, the Fed is transparent.
[00:33:46.951 --> 00:33:49.673]  And Bernanke will say, no, the Fed is transparent.
[00:33:49.713 --> 00:33:51.254]  Yeah, we have to answer to Congress.
[00:33:51.334 --> 00:33:53.056]  Yeah, we have to answer to Congress.
[00:33:54.244 --> 00:33:57.706]  And then Bernie Sanders, the Senator, gets up there and he says, tell us who got the money.
[00:33:58.906 --> 00:34:01.647]  And what does Bernanke say back to him?
[00:34:02.828 --> 00:34:03.228]  No.
[00:34:03.248 --> 00:34:03.288]  No.
[00:34:04.769 --> 00:34:10.431]  They're about as transparent as a lead beam, basically.
[00:34:10.471 --> 00:34:11.712]  That's about how transparent.
[00:34:11.732 --> 00:34:13.633]  You can see right through that lead beam, can't you folks?
[00:34:13.673 --> 00:34:14.413]  That's what they'll tell you.
[00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:16.454]  They'll stare right at you like you can see right through it.
[00:34:17.125 --> 00:34:17.525]  Give me a break.
[00:34:33.134 --> 00:34:41.399]  Forget which website it is, but if you just type in Special Drawing Rights Units, and then Conversion, Paul, you can see how much they're worth.
[00:34:41.419 --> 00:34:47.903]  They actually have a value now, and I think per one unit, which is like a dollar, I guess, we're worth 60 cents.
[00:34:48.404 --> 00:34:50.845]  And my last check was when I was in D.C.
[00:34:50.865 --> 00:34:55.288]  with Tarpley, and the denar seemed to be the most valued currency out there.
[00:34:55.328 --> 00:34:57.369]  We were like the fifth or sixth most valued currency.
[00:34:57.389 --> 00:34:58.870]  We're not at the top of the heap anymore, folks.
[00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.931]  We're far from it.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:07.842]  The government agency that guarantees Americans won't lose their money in a bank failure may need a lifeline of its own.
[00:35:08.242 --> 00:35:10.362]  Oh, so you mean my money's not safe in a bank?
[00:35:10.403 --> 00:35:15.664]  You mean the FDIC, who's supposed to make sure that my money's safe in a bank, isn't safe at all?
[00:35:15.804 --> 00:35:16.364]  Of course not!
[00:35:16.384 --> 00:35:17.725]  They're printing the money out of nowhere!
[00:35:17.905 --> 00:35:18.725]  There's no backing!
[00:35:20.134 --> 00:35:31.518]  The coffers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp have been so depleted by the epidemic of collapsing financial institutions that analysts warn it could sink into the red by the end of this year.
[00:35:42.958 --> 00:35:46.420]  A pound is worth a little bit more than one SDR unit.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.781]  .10767 blah blah blah.
[00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:51.642]  Now a dollar is only worth .63.
[00:35:53.163 --> 00:35:59.545]  That means that the pound is about 40% more value than our little dollaroo.
[00:36:00.046 --> 00:36:00.346]  Okay?
[00:36:00.866 --> 00:36:02.387]  And those are just two of the currencies.
[00:36:02.407 --> 00:36:04.148]  You really need to see how desperate we are.
[00:36:04.748 --> 00:36:07.389]  SDR equals world currency.
[00:36:07.449 --> 00:36:09.430]  Just because they don't have a coin yet,
[00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:15.054]  Or a bill yet doesn't mean this isn't a global governance grab.
[00:36:15.094 --> 00:36:16.294]  It's exactly what it is.
[00:36:16.655 --> 00:36:17.515]  It's exactly what it is.
[00:36:17.755 --> 00:36:23.239]  Meanwhile, they're telling you they're now announcing it that the people that ensure your maybe there will be a bank holiday, folks.
[00:36:23.339 --> 00:36:28.102]  I'm not one of those guys that goes off these predictions that there's definitely going to be a bank holiday on this and this date.
[00:36:28.383 --> 00:36:31.044]  And yes, the economy is going to plunge by this and this date.
[00:36:31.445 --> 00:36:33.126]  Look, if you got gold and silver.
[00:36:34.178 --> 00:36:34.999]  You might be okay.
[00:36:35.139 --> 00:36:35.979]  Midas Resources.
[00:36:36.059 --> 00:36:37.080]  That's not devaluing.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.241]  That's going up in value.
[00:36:38.261 --> 00:36:41.603]  In fact, the last time I checked, I think gold was at like $9.50 or $9.60 an ounce.
[00:36:42.784 --> 00:36:46.787]  Again, when I started listening to Alex Jones in 2003, it was under $300 an ounce.
[00:36:47.528 --> 00:36:48.569]  Do the math, okay?
[00:36:48.629 --> 00:36:52.191]  It tripled in value in just over 5 years.
[00:36:53.252 --> 00:36:55.894]  I'd say under 10 years, but it's just over 5 years.
[00:36:55.914 --> 00:36:56.174]  6 years!
[00:36:56.775 --> 00:36:57.135]  6 years!
[00:36:57.655 --> 00:36:58.556]  Tripled in value!
[00:36:59.477 --> 00:37:02.259]  Meanwhile, the FDIC is now saying it doesn't have any money.
[00:37:03.217 --> 00:37:08.962]  Well, if the FDIC doesn't have any money, and your banks don't have any money, then you don't have any money.
[00:37:09.882 --> 00:37:10.443]  And guess what?
[00:37:10.463 --> 00:37:13.045]  The offshore banksters out there, they already took all the money.
[00:37:13.285 --> 00:37:16.228]  They converted it, and they put it into offshore accounts.
[00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:23.854]  They gave out billions in bonuses when they looted us for 24 trill and counting!
[00:37:23.914 --> 00:37:25.475]  What did you think was gonna happen?
[00:37:26.616 --> 00:37:27.357]  Give me a break!
[00:37:29.571 --> 00:37:40.738]  That has only happened once before, so this has only happened once before during the savings and loan crisis of the early 1990s when the FDIC was forced to borrow $15 billion from the Treasury and repay it later with interest.
[00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:43.620]  $15 billion seems like a drop in the bucket at this point.
[00:37:44.121 --> 00:37:50.165]  When we're openly talking now about $24 trillion, what is $15 billion?
[00:37:50.185 --> 00:37:51.325]  It's not even comparable!
[00:37:52.406 --> 00:37:54.748]  And we're only talking about a little over a decade ago.
[00:37:56.035 --> 00:37:58.357]  We're not talking about 30, 40 years ago.
[00:37:58.417 --> 00:38:03.402]  No, a little over a decade ago, $15 billion from the Treasury.
[00:38:04.823 --> 00:38:08.827]  On Thursday, the agency reveals how much it's left in its reserves.
[00:38:08.867 --> 00:38:09.388]  Yeah, right.
[00:38:09.508 --> 00:38:11.770]  I guarantee they're supposed to announce that today.
[00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:17.055]  I guarantee it's a bunch of garbled jargon and they don't tell you how much is really there.
[00:38:18.416 --> 00:38:19.536]  And so it's what they always do.
[00:38:19.916 --> 00:38:26.157]  FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair may also use the quarterly briefing to say how the agency plans to shore up its accounts.
[00:38:26.217 --> 00:38:31.018]  Small and mid-sized banks across the United States have been hurt by rising loan defaults and the recession.
[00:38:31.278 --> 00:38:35.699]  When they fail, the FDIC is responsible for making sure depositors don't lose a cent.
[00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:40.960]  And yesterday we did mention that the second largest bank in the United States went under.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.260]  It's in Texas.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:43.880]  Where is that article?
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.141]  That article should be right here.
[00:38:45.201 --> 00:38:46.121]  We covered it yesterday.
[00:38:46.141 --> 00:38:46.801]  But yes, that's right.
[00:38:47.668 --> 00:38:53.571]  Went under in Texas and they're just going to keep going under and just keep going down and they're going to go after the local banks first.
[00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:55.852]  Again, this is a consolidation of power.
[00:38:56.472 --> 00:38:57.632]  Do you understand?
[00:38:58.153 --> 00:39:09.978]  They have to gut all the local banks so that they can grab up with the big banks, the most corrupt banks like Chase Manhattan, like Bank of America that merged, like Merrill Lynch.
[00:39:10.718 --> 00:39:15.300]  They want to be the only players in the game so that they can just change the currency whenever they like.
[00:39:16.434 --> 00:39:17.235]  That's what's up.
[00:39:17.776 --> 00:39:18.817]  That's what it's all about.
[00:39:19.117 --> 00:39:22.221]  This is nothing more than a power grab, okay?
[00:39:22.922 --> 00:39:28.388]  This has nothing to do with saving the economy or giving back to the American people.
[00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:36.177]  This has everything to do with cutting out the small banksters, the people who might be semi-honest,
[00:39:37.423 --> 00:39:41.727]  And just looting everything for a new international system.
[00:39:41.867 --> 00:39:43.489]  A new world order.
[00:39:43.709 --> 00:39:43.929]  Okay?
[00:39:43.969 --> 00:39:45.291]  That's their terminology.
[00:39:45.531 --> 00:39:46.952]  That's why I'm making this film.
[00:39:47.192 --> 00:39:49.855]  That's why Invisible Empire is soon going to exist.
[00:39:50.055 --> 00:39:57.783]  Because people have to understand that the only people that are using this term outside of Alex Jones, myself, other pundits who are against it,
[00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:00.484]  Are the power elite and their minions.
[00:40:00.805 --> 00:40:02.726]  That's who uses the term New World Order.
[00:40:03.227 --> 00:40:08.992]  It's not some kind of fancy pants, leprechaun, unicorn terminology over rainbows and gold, okay?
[00:40:09.392 --> 00:40:12.135]  It's something that has been used throughout history.
[00:40:12.175 --> 00:40:14.657]  I mean, Napoleon actually talked about a New World Order.
[00:40:15.037 --> 00:40:16.959]  Hitler, of course, talked about a New World Order.
[00:40:16.979 --> 00:40:25.266]  And every time they talk about it, they're talking about a tyrannical system of government where they and their cronies rule over a dictatorship.
[00:40:26.769 --> 00:40:31.150]  And I'm not saying that's not something we really have right now, but it's a soft dictatorship.
[00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:32.830]  There's still the illusion that we have freedom.
[00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:33.891]  We still have some freedoms.
[00:40:33.911 --> 00:40:35.151]  We still have some recourses.
[00:40:35.491 --> 00:40:36.731]  Most of them have been taken away.
[00:40:36.751 --> 00:40:42.893]  I mean, again, when you see Bernanke up there just saying, oh, we're transparent, then they get asked who the bank's got the money.
[00:40:43.333 --> 00:40:43.973]  And he says, no.
[00:40:44.793 --> 00:40:46.894]  And then Geithner goes, well, 1207, we can't.
[00:40:47.114 --> 00:40:49.114]  See, we can't let it get political.
[00:40:49.634 --> 00:40:50.295]  What does that even mean?
[00:40:50.335 --> 00:40:52.055]  We can't let it get political.
[00:40:53.470 --> 00:41:01.032]  The books from the Federal Reserve have nothing to do with politics unless you're being corrupt and you're giving your friends all this money, which is what you're doing.
[00:41:01.092 --> 00:41:01.652]  That's what you're doing.
[00:41:01.672 --> 00:41:07.893]  You're protecting your globalist masters, and that's why you don't want us to audit the Fed.
[00:41:08.454 --> 00:41:10.954]  You know, I don't know what's going to happen if the FDIC goes under.
[00:41:11.714 --> 00:41:12.915]  I am not an economist.
[00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:17.630]  Bob Chapman could tell you, internationalforecaster.com.
[00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:22.974]  I'm sure this is going to be the hot topic next week on the show, especially if it just continues to get worse.
[00:41:23.515 --> 00:41:28.439]  But all the excuses they give you are just going to be a bunch of Johnny Nonsense, folks.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.521]  They want to gut this economy.
[00:41:30.541 --> 00:41:31.822]  They're going to continue to do so.
[00:41:32.123 --> 00:41:33.644]  They want a North American Union.
[00:41:33.804 --> 00:41:35.746]  A lot of people say they're going to scrap the North American Union.
[00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:36.386]  I don't believe that.
[00:41:36.406 --> 00:41:38.088]  They may not call it the North American Union.
[00:41:38.388 --> 00:41:43.170]  I didn't get to cover this story yesterday, but I think it's worth covering, especially with my little YouTube rant in the beginning.
[00:41:43.491 --> 00:41:47.132]  YouTube to share ad money with video makers of unexpected internet hits.
[00:42:03.993 --> 00:42:28.692]  So now you make an internet hit like My New Haircut or The Obama Deception perhaps and YouTube's going to contact you with an email and then you're going to have to sign something and then you'll make money on the things they advertise for this movie or for your little short basically they'll put in like a 20 or 30 second ad in the beginning that you can't fast forward through and then play your film
[00:42:29.719 --> 00:42:32.241]  Now, it doesn't say what the specifications are going to be.
[00:42:32.362 --> 00:42:33.343]  I'm a little wary on it.
[00:42:33.423 --> 00:42:38.768]  I don't know if they're ever going to promote, you know, the material that we promote here at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:42:38.868 --> 00:42:42.211]  It looks like they're going to just promote mindlessness, which is what they're good at.
[00:42:43.092 --> 00:42:49.358]  But, I wonder if we do get big enough and all of a sudden we get this email from YouTube who constantly censors us.
[00:42:50.498 --> 00:42:52.040]  Do they have a right to our material?
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.941]  All of a sudden, do we lose rights on our material?
[00:42:53.961 --> 00:42:55.783]  Are they allowed to use it in any which way they can?
[00:42:55.843 --> 00:43:00.007]  So I guess, you know, as soon as one of our listeners gets one of these emails, I would love to see it.
[00:43:00.047 --> 00:43:01.048]  I'd like to see the terms.
[00:43:01.269 --> 00:43:06.494]  I'm not necessarily against people getting paid for their content, especially if they're going to sell advertising on the page.
[00:43:06.514 --> 00:43:08.876]  I think this is actually a positive move.
[00:43:09.336 --> 00:43:13.841]  But again, I'd have to see what kind of contract they're going to get you to sign.
[00:43:15.799 --> 00:43:19.160]  Climate Camp London, day two live.
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:27.284]  Follow the latest developments from Climate Camp's main camp on Blackheath, southeast London and protesters' direct action against big business in the city.
[00:43:28.044 --> 00:43:29.525]  See, these are well-meaning idiots.
[00:43:30.498 --> 00:43:39.124]  We think that things like cap and trade are a good thing and we're murdering trees and, you know, this whole environmental movement and the green movement is going up against the establishment.
[00:43:39.204 --> 00:43:40.565]  Hey folks, I got news for you.
[00:43:40.645 --> 00:43:41.025]  It's not.
[00:43:41.105 --> 00:43:42.286]  Pollution isn't going to end.
[00:43:42.746 --> 00:43:48.530]  It's probably going to get worse because all you're allowing them to do is now buy the right to pollute.
[00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:52.853]  And if you think they're actually going to be buying these carbon credits, no, they're going to be given them.
[00:43:52.893 --> 00:43:53.934]  We covered that yesterday.
[00:43:53.974 --> 00:43:58.297]  A bunch of big corporations are already just going to be given these carbon credits.
[00:43:58.977 --> 00:44:01.459]  Okay, it'll be just like the corporate welfare of today.
[00:44:01.799 --> 00:44:06.403]  The difference is it will be a global tax on the average American citizen.
[00:44:06.763 --> 00:44:10.066]  You're not going to get away with having your AC on too high.
[00:44:10.366 --> 00:44:12.948]  You're not going to get away with six bags of garbage.
[00:44:13.368 --> 00:44:16.731]  You're not going to get away with using too much two-ply toilet paper.
[00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:27.239]  Yeah, there was actually articles in the last few months in mainline media that America's consumption of two-ply toilet paper is actually worse for the environment than SUVs.
[00:44:28.359 --> 00:44:30.060]  What, I'm not supposed to be able to wipe my bottom?
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.501]  I mean, what is this?
[00:44:32.082 --> 00:44:33.303]  What, is this madness?
[00:44:33.343 --> 00:44:38.066]  Yes, that is a madness when you hear things proposed like that, but we're just going along.
[00:44:39.027 --> 00:44:39.728]  Nothing's wrong.
[00:44:39.788 --> 00:44:40.368]  Nothing's wrong.
[00:44:40.408 --> 00:44:41.609]  My old phone works great.
[00:44:41.669 --> 00:44:42.049]  I love it.
[00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:43.651]  I like my Blu-ray player.
[00:44:43.691 --> 00:44:45.392]  Look at me, 50 inch television.
[00:44:45.712 --> 00:44:48.034]  I got some rims on my car.
[00:44:48.354 --> 00:44:49.175]  Look at my house.
[00:44:49.235 --> 00:44:50.256]  I got a nice condo.
[00:44:50.556 --> 00:44:52.117]  That's what we're concerned with.
[00:44:52.898 --> 00:44:54.399]  My sports team's doing real good.
[00:44:55.197 --> 00:44:56.358]  Look at those Phillies go!
[00:44:56.718 --> 00:44:59.359]  Actually, I'm pretty stoked about the Yankees on their win streak as well.
[00:44:59.439 --> 00:45:02.560]  I don't even get to watch the games, folks.
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:08.023]  I get to maybe check out the sports section two or three times a week while I'm going through the news for this program.
[00:45:08.403 --> 00:45:16.347]  I'm not saying you have to give up everything in life and just become totally obsessed with the parapolitics of today, the politics that matter, the reality of the situation.
[00:45:16.707 --> 00:45:26.191]  I am saying, you need to wake the hell up, find the issues that matter to you, that are going to affect your life, which are plentiful at this point, and step up to the plate, swing the bat.
[00:45:26.551 --> 00:45:26.771]  Okay?
[00:45:27.012 --> 00:45:27.692]  Tell your neighbors.
[00:45:28.132 --> 00:45:28.732]  Tell your friends.
[00:45:28.932 --> 00:45:29.613]  Tell your families.
[00:45:30.618 --> 00:45:32.079]  Go out to city council meetings.
[00:45:32.599 --> 00:45:36.580]  Okay, go to these town halls is what they're calling them.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.920]  They're anything but town halls.
[00:45:37.961 --> 00:45:46.403]  I mean, I was watching one, I think it was yesterday I was watching one, and the lady starts asking a real question that's not on the card and the guy just goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.384]  Listen, that's not on the card.
[00:45:48.664 --> 00:45:50.025]  Please read the question on the card.
[00:45:50.285 --> 00:45:53.946]  How dare I have to answer something that hasn't been pre-screened by my handlers?
[00:45:56.937 --> 00:46:05.760]  I mean, folks, we are at a dark period in this country and the world when Newsweek's openly saying we're a society of liars.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:06.760]  And we are!
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.100]  I mean, that's an honest article.
[00:46:08.141 --> 00:46:15.903]  We are a society of liars that lie to ourselves in the morning when we wake up, when we go to bed at night, when we go to work.
[00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:19.698]  When we talk to our families, and they're right, we do lie to our children.
[00:46:19.738 --> 00:46:21.460]  We don't tell them how bad it is out there.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.042]  We don't prepare them for the real world.
[00:46:23.082 --> 00:46:34.237]  We send them off into government institutions and let them think what their teachers are saying is the almighty word, and that Barack Obama is going to save us all, and that we made big strides to get him elected.
[00:46:35.356 --> 00:46:42.059]  Look, if we had gotten a real, real candidate in there, you know, a lot of people will say, Jason Vermas is a racist.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.800]  I voted for a black woman, folks.
[00:46:44.621 --> 00:46:46.442]  I would have gone with the two-spot, you know.
[00:46:46.882 --> 00:46:49.423]  We could have had a woman as president, a black woman as president.
[00:46:49.443 --> 00:46:52.345]  It would have been great because she stood for the right issues.
[00:46:52.405 --> 00:46:53.445]  I voted Cynthia McKinney.
[00:46:53.966 --> 00:46:55.747]  I may not be for everything McKinney's for.
[00:46:55.987 --> 00:47:00.749]  She's a bit of a gun grabber, a bit of a leftist, but at least she's honest, okay?
[00:47:00.809 --> 00:47:03.731]  At least she's trying to take on the status quo.
[00:47:04.608 --> 00:47:06.789]  And she gets no press coverage.
[00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:14.630]  I mean, for the third-party candidates, I think she got the least out of everybody, and that includes people like Ralph Nader and Chuck Baldwin and, of course, Bob Barr.
[00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:21.492]  Cynthia McKinney is who you heard about the least, and I really do believe because she was the most dangerous to the establishment.
[00:47:22.132 --> 00:47:26.253]  They didn't want her to become a quote-unquote cult of personality like Ron Paul did.
[00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:30.694]  And you know, a lot of people complain, oh I gave money to the Ron Paul money bomb, he didn't win.
[00:47:31.114 --> 00:47:34.217]  Folks, he stayed in it to win it as long as he possibly could.
[00:47:34.317 --> 00:47:36.979]  He was in these debates interjecting real issues.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.563]  He became HUGE during and after the elections.
[00:47:41.843 --> 00:47:44.406]  His predictions about the economy have actually come true.
[00:47:44.726 --> 00:47:47.288]  More and more people listen to his message every day.
[00:47:47.848 --> 00:47:52.552]  And now his son Rand Paul is trying to get a seat in the Senate to continue the legacy
[00:47:53.533 --> 00:47:56.876]  Of challenge, of freedom, of liberty in this country.
[00:47:57.797 --> 00:48:00.059]  I don't see many of us out there doing that.
[00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:10.187]  You know, it takes a lot to dedicate yourself to going up against a political leviathan like this system has become, whether you're Ron Paul's son or not.
[00:48:11.028 --> 00:48:16.032]  And how many of you out there can say, yeah, I stand for something and I'm willing to show it.
[00:48:16.112 --> 00:48:20.536]  I am willing to run for Congress, for State Senate, for mayor of my little town.
[00:48:21.076 --> 00:48:29.022]  I am willing to go to the board meeting up in my school and say, no, my children are not going to take the swine flu vaccination, and I suggest your children don't either.
[00:48:29.382 --> 00:48:34.726]  How many of you are going to go up with a laptop in hand
[00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:45.181]  Pull up the clip from 1979 where 60 Minutes talks about the 76 flu pandemic and how it gave Gillian's Bear to all these people, how it killed all these people.
[00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:46.121]  How many of you are going to do that?
[00:48:46.141 --> 00:48:48.982]  Because I guarantee you do that, you're going to turn some heads.
[00:48:49.822 --> 00:48:53.563]  Some people in the PTA are going to go, wait a minute, I'm not letting my kid take this either.
[00:48:53.603 --> 00:48:54.423]  This is insanity.
[00:48:55.224 --> 00:49:04.986]  How many people are going to print off the Bloomberg article that Baxter sent live bird flu virus out to 14 separate countries in its trials?
[00:49:05.868 --> 00:49:06.829]  How many people are going to do that?
[00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:11.433]  And then say, hey, this is the company they want to give us the vaccinations.
[00:49:12.575 --> 00:49:14.937]  How many people are going to break out Executive Order 13375?
[00:49:14.977 --> 00:49:18.720]  Where they say, you know what, you don't want to take this?
[00:49:18.981 --> 00:49:19.782]  One year in prison, $250,000 fine.
[00:49:22.967 --> 00:49:30.933]  Who's gonna go get the pandemic preparedness planning checklist from the WHO and say, look, we're under level six right now, right now!
[00:49:31.254 --> 00:49:32.194]  It can't get any worse.
[00:49:32.455 --> 00:49:33.656]  People could be dying in the streets.
[00:49:33.896 --> 00:49:35.157]  It can't get any worse than this.
[00:49:35.457 --> 00:49:37.679]  And this, what does it says about your human rights?
[00:49:37.839 --> 00:49:38.740]  It says you don't have any.
[00:49:40.121 --> 00:49:43.023]  It says it's quarantine town USA under international law.
[00:49:43.684 --> 00:49:44.985]  It says we can take your buildings.
[00:49:45.685 --> 00:49:47.927]  It says we can do what we have to.
[00:49:48.568 --> 00:49:50.970]  And they're not just saying it, they're holding conferences on it.
[00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:52.511]  They're prepping the public.
[00:49:54.312 --> 00:49:58.795]  They're telling you all you need to know on Fox News, yet they don't tell you anything you need to know.
[00:49:59.155 --> 00:50:01.676]  They just tell you to shut up and take your shot.
[00:50:02.237 --> 00:50:08.880]  And it's being echoed on the other side, because remember, oh, there's a left and a right, you know, if you want to believe in that false paradigm.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:12.502]  They're printing almost the same exact article at MSNBC.
[00:50:13.963 --> 00:50:20.387]  So why is it that Fox and MSNBC are parroting the same exact propaganda and information for you?
[00:50:21.007 --> 00:50:21.808]  Why do you think that is?
[00:50:22.841 --> 00:50:25.582]  It's because they want you to roll up your sleeve and take the poison.
[00:50:35.874 --> 00:50:38.096]  Hundreds of thousands of people getting sick.
[00:50:38.136 --> 00:50:39.678]  I think they're going to keep it pretty quiet.
[00:50:39.698 --> 00:50:43.101]  You'll probably see, you know, maybe 10-20,000 people die.
[00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:47.945]  Maybe another 50 or 60 get really sick from the thing, but it'll be very hush-hush.
[00:50:48.746 --> 00:50:52.569]  Meanwhile, you just took a live cancer vaccine and 20 years down the line, you ain't gonna be doing so hot.
[00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:53.831]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:53.931 --> 00:50:54.911]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:57.374]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:51:03.581 --> 00:51:10.565]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[00:51:10.806 --> 00:51:14.448]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[00:51:14.748 --> 00:51:22.813]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[00:51:23.073 --> 00:51:25.775]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[00:51:25.975 --> 00:51:28.457]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[00:51:28.737 --> 00:51:29.218]  We're good.
[00:51:47.318 --> 00:51:47.718]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:47.778 --> 00:51:48.679]  A new world order.
[00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:49.279]  In the near future.
[00:52:09.801 --> 00:52:12.502]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:12.882 --> 00:52:15.002]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:15.703 --> 00:52:17.883]  Both their objective being world domination.
[00:52:18.483 --> 00:52:20.944]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:21.664 --> 00:52:28.986]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:32.025 --> 00:52:36.968]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:52:37.449 --> 00:52:40.971]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:52:41.351 --> 00:52:43.853]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:52:43.893 --> 00:52:45.034]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:45.054 --> 00:52:45.834]  They're not after money.
[00:52:45.854 --> 00:52:46.935]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:47.135 --> 00:52:47.836]  They're after power.
[00:52:48.116 --> 00:52:49.216]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:52:49.257 --> 00:52:53.739]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:54:16.592 --> 00:54:19.154]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in for another five minutes.
[00:54:19.174 --> 00:54:23.756]  Then we've got Alex coming up with Wayne, Paul, Dr. LeBeau, General Stolbein, and Bob Cohen.
[00:54:23.817 --> 00:54:29.540]  I want to take this opportunity to thank another one of our great sponsors, NewSilverSolution.com.
[00:54:30.741 --> 00:54:33.563]  People all over the world are discovering the benefits of supernatural silver.
[00:54:33.963 --> 00:54:39.907]  The powerful new nanotechnology is a natural antibiotic and preventative against infections, germs, and disease.
[00:54:40.347 --> 00:54:41.388]  You know, this along with
[00:54:42.705 --> 00:54:46.166]  Actually taking care of your body, you know, exercising.
[00:54:46.646 --> 00:54:51.948]  That'll guarantee you don't get sick from the quote-unquote swine flu or flu or any kind of virus they want to put out there.
[00:54:52.028 --> 00:54:55.189]  SilverSolution.com, one of our great, great sponsors.
[00:54:55.689 --> 00:54:59.010]  Go check them out at SuperNaturalSilver.com right now.
[00:54:59.091 --> 00:55:03.172]  SuperNaturalSilver or there's a big banner over at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:55:04.232 --> 00:55:12.039]  Alright folks, I really want to encourage all you info warriors out there to spread the trailers for Fall of the Republic and Invisible Empire around the world.
[00:55:12.059 --> 00:55:14.801]  I already know that somebody put my trailer in Portuguese.
[00:55:14.821 --> 00:55:17.223]  I'm seeing the same thing happening with Fall of the Republic.
[00:55:17.884 --> 00:55:26.912]  In order to compete with the mainline establishment, the people that can pay YouTube $100,000 to put their ad on the front page for the day, and it's still
[00:55:27.472 --> 00:55:30.294]  Doesn't go as viral overall as our stuff.
[00:55:30.354 --> 00:55:31.435]  Michael Moore, you're hearing us.
[00:55:31.935 --> 00:55:39.320]  We are knocking at the door of the biggest documentary filmmaker in history and no one covers it.
[00:55:40.101 --> 00:55:47.126]  No one wants to say that we're that important in the actual spectrum of politics in this country.
[00:55:49.352 --> 00:55:50.633]  Of the worldwide reality.
[00:55:50.954 --> 00:55:52.295]  I mean, that's what no one wants to talk about.
[00:55:52.335 --> 00:56:06.288]  Nobody wants to talk about the influence of Infowars.com, of Alex Jones, of the Obama deception, of martial law, of loose change, of all these pictures that are paradigm shifters that have reached millions and millions and millions of people.
[00:56:07.088 --> 00:56:10.351]  So please, please, please, I'm begging you out there.
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:12.220]  Get the trailers.
[00:56:12.561 --> 00:56:15.402]  You know, we don't have to repost them a million times either.
[00:56:16.262 --> 00:56:20.404]  You find that the one that has the most views, pass that one along.
[00:56:20.724 --> 00:56:22.185]  That's the one we need to go viral.
[00:56:22.385 --> 00:56:25.346]  You see, it's the numbers that they can't deny.
[00:56:25.666 --> 00:56:27.847]  It's the numbers that get the mainstream coverage.
[00:56:28.928 --> 00:56:35.391]  You know, that's why Obama went biggest, because Change the Channel put up in his account a one-spot version.
[00:56:37.114 --> 00:56:42.138]  You look at the other versions, yeah, they have millions of hits, but it's 1 through 12, and they range between their numbers.
[00:56:42.638 --> 00:56:46.681]  You put it all up at once, people sit down and they watch it, and their jaw is on the floor.
[00:56:47.922 --> 00:56:52.726]  And then the mainstream media, like the Wall Street Journal comes out here, and they say, oh, we're going to do this big story on you.
[00:56:53.126 --> 00:56:54.967]  It doesn't bash us enough, so they can't put it out.
[00:56:56.409 --> 00:56:58.190]  At least make them cover it.
[00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:01.723]  I mean, LA Times talked about the Obama deception.
[00:57:02.363 --> 00:57:06.105]  We can have an effect, so please, listeners out there, help us out.
[00:57:06.765 --> 00:57:19.650]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv, post us on YouTube, spread the links, get a copy of the Obama deception, a hard copy, make copies, hand it out to friends, show it in your church, in your local youth center.
[00:57:20.683 --> 00:57:24.626]  As an after school project, students out there, you can be very effective with things like this.
[00:57:24.666 --> 00:57:25.787]  Bring this into your teacher.
[00:57:26.208 --> 00:57:27.549]  You know, 9-11 is on its way.
[00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.930]  It's just around the corner.
[00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:33.974]  Eight years after the biggest false flag event in history.
[00:57:34.114 --> 00:57:36.856]  Many people still don't know what's going on, don't know the truth.
[00:57:37.297 --> 00:57:38.678]  Here it is, it's fabled enemies.
[00:57:39.761 --> 00:57:41.662]  It's available over at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:41.922 --> 00:57:54.130]  If you want to know the international intelligence organization that carried out 9-11, you want to know about the cover-up, you want to know about the anthrax attacks, you want to know what happened in World Trade Center Building 7, this is the definitive film, folks.
[00:57:54.711 --> 00:57:56.892]  And it's only available over at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:56.932 --> 00:57:57.933]  It supports what we do here.
[00:57:58.533 --> 00:58:19.828]  Because, quite frankly, it's very hard to do 20 hours, it's 20 plus hours of material on a radio show, then do a 2 hour motion picture, and then spot, I mean he produces my next 2 hour motion picture, he does a Sunday show, I do a Sunday show, people can't imagine how much goes on here, and how much effort is put in.
[00:58:21.445 --> 00:58:22.426]  So I hope you support us all.
[00:58:22.446 --> 00:58:27.509]  Remember, Alex is coming up right after this with Wayne Paul, Dr. Lebeau, General Stolbein, and Bob Cohen.
[00:58:27.569 --> 00:58:28.910]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in.
[00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:33.792]  Go check us out over at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlan.TV, and spread those trailers far and wide.
[00:58:33.853 --> 00:58:34.353]  Thank you all.
