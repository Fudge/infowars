[00:00:02.586 --> 00:00:08.613]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:12.257]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.104]  It is the second day of June.
[00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.410]  2009 on this Tuesday.
[00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.151]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:26.553]  We just started simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:26.573 --> 00:00:37.860]  We will simulcast the last two hours and 52 minutes today of this four-hour show that we do Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.840]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.761]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:41.882]  And so much always happens over the weekend.
[00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:44.704]  I come in on Sunday evenings 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:48.166]  Central Standard Time at the end of one week and the start of the next.
[00:00:48.766 --> 00:01:11.595]  uh... to look at the week past and the week to come so we are here six days a week live don't forget here on the genesis network also we have jason bermos live at nine to midnight out of the same studios all three hours of that show is simulcast at prison planet dot tv for the prison planet dot tv members and i was just thinking we need to get micro vero on for a couple hours on uh... jason bermos a show those two
[00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:16.941]  I would imagine it would make quite a team covering the news and information.
[00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:23.851]  Before I go to the illustrious Mike Rivero, who by the way has his own great WhatReallyHappened.com t-shirt you should get to support him.
[00:01:24.412 --> 00:01:25.333]  You want it, you got it.
[00:01:25.373 --> 00:01:27.656]  Listeners had the idea for us to put the Gadsden flag
[00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:29.317]  Don't tread on me.
[00:01:30.378 --> 00:01:31.398]  Unite or die.
[00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.298]  Live free or die.
[00:01:32.378 --> 00:01:37.280]  This same image of the rattlesnake had all three things under it on different flags.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:46.983]  But this is the most popular, used by the Marine Corps and the Army, now listed by the Feds as terrorism and as a reason to be taken into jail.
[00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:51.275]  Now, that's in the Homeland Security and MIAC documents.
[00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:58.758]  I have to tell you, I've been wearing these in public, I've been wearing the Minuteman shirt in public, and later if I have time I'll tell stories.
[00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:02.960]  Literally, I was at the IGA food place at like 9.30 at night,
[00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:28.450]  When I was down at the beach buying pancake mix and milk, and I was buying a pad of paper that I was writing notes, and this is just one of many stories, and I was wearing the shirt that said Live Free or Die on it, similar to this Patriot shirt we have with the Infowars wear to identify yourself with liberty, lovers, and to meet like-minded people, and all of a sudden I had a security guard walk up
[00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:29.995]  Nobody's around me.
[00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:31.159]  The place is almost empty.
[00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.052]  As I'm putting stuff in the cart, pens and a little pad of paper, he's actually buying this.
[00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.710]  This pad right here.
[00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:45.536]  And he came up and looked at the front of my shirt, looked at my back, and I almost said something to him, but I was all sunburned and brain dead and just wanted to go home and go to sleep and go back to the back of the cabin.
[00:02:46.256 --> 00:02:52.740]  And I just kind of let him do it and, you know, look at it, the front and back of the shirt, and then he kind of stood down and acted like he was looking at something and walked off.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.521]  Because, see, they all get the reports.
[00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.542]  You've got to watch somebody that's got a Minuteman on their shirt.
[00:02:57.783 --> 00:03:00.464]  You've got to watch people that talk about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:01.845]  So I hope everybody
[00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:03.986]  We'll get this shirt, and I hope we'll all wear it.
[00:03:04.026 --> 00:03:05.606]  It's available at Infowars.com.
[00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:07.907]  And stop being such cowardly slaves.
[00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:13.468]  If we give in to the chilling effect, and give in to this demonization, then they're going to win.
[00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:14.589]  But they are the kooks.
[00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:15.849]  That security guard was a kook.
[00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:24.371]  The off-duty cops with their wives walking down the beach that would stop it, and look at the shirts, and they'd be walking and looking, and then kind of scared.
[00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:26.992]  And some of these guys were big guys, you know, high and tight haircuts.
[00:03:27.672 --> 00:03:29.753]  And they'd kind of read it and look, and I'd go, hi, how you doing?
[00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:33.329]  I mean, God, here's one of them.
[00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:34.350]  He's with the Founders.
[00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.010]  He's with Liberty.
[00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.871]  He's with Freedom.
[00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:36.512]  He's with the Bill of Rights.
[00:03:37.052 --> 00:03:37.633]  He's one of them.
[00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:38.894]  Oh my God, he wants to kill me.
[00:03:39.074 --> 00:03:40.956]  He wants to... And, you know, in a way it is.
[00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:42.998]  It is true that we're going to be enemies.
[00:03:43.558 --> 00:03:46.301]  You've chosen evil, you know, the Soviet Nazi way.
[00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:47.642]  We've chosen the Republic.
[00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:50.304]  And so we are, I guess, enemies of the New World Order.
[00:03:50.344 --> 00:03:52.046]  And you know it's going to be a hot war.
[00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:55.649]  And I guess they realize I'm wearing the wrong colors.
[00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.010]  I'm wearing American colors.
[00:03:57.691 --> 00:03:59.772]  You know, these guys just wrap themselves in the flags.
[00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:00.953]  They don't live it.
[00:04:01.513 --> 00:04:05.775]  They just use the flag as an excuse to urinate all over what this country stands for.
[00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:16.060]  So let me tell you, they are scared of these, and these federal reports have gone out to the smallest departments, and you want to see a vampire, you know, having holy water thrown on him, or a cross.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.701]  This is the shirt.
[00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:19.642]  Because this is a ghost.
[00:04:20.122 --> 00:04:26.847]  Every time they would see the Minuteman on my shirt, the other shirt, let's punch that up for folks, it was as if they had seen a ghost.
[00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:27.628]  And I guess it was.
[00:04:28.028 --> 00:04:29.289]  Liberty and Freedom is dying.
[00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.251]  There were Homeland Security trucks driving up and down the beach.
[00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:35.554]  You try to go to the National Seashore, they got license plate scanners everywhere.
[00:04:35.794 --> 00:04:38.356]  They ask you questions about why you're going to the National Seashore.
[00:04:38.776 --> 00:04:40.317]  This country is going into tyranny.
[00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:43.360]  Mike Rivera, good to have you joining us from Hawaii, sir.
[00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.582]  Aloha Nui Nui Nui.
[00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:47.983]  What do you think of my Conker Band shirt?
[00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:48.704]  I mean, I'm evil.
[00:04:49.564 --> 00:04:51.526]  Well, absolutely, absolutely you are.
[00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:55.548]  And it looks really good on you, I have to say that at the same time.
[00:04:55.848 --> 00:04:59.431]  Some of the shirts that we have, you know, we get these mixed reactions to.
[00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:04.234]  Pretty much everyone sort of gives a stink face with the Eat the Rich t-shirts.
[00:05:04.854 --> 00:05:10.499]  But the one about I survived the Bush economy and all I have left is this lousy t-shirt, that one tends to get a lot of laughs.
[00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:27.072]  But while I was listening to you, I have a suggestion, and I'll probably do this on my t-shirts and you should do it on yours, is just something where instead of sort of being this confrontational image of us and them, is to include them into the issue, such as bailout means you are now on the hook for $100,000.
[00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:33.839]  So when the cops are looking at that t-shirt, they start thinking, yeah, that means me as well.
[00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:44.953]  The government is sticking me with all these hundreds of thousands of dollars of bills to give to the bank, and maybe start pulling them over a little bit more to our side, rather than justifying their paranoia and their defensiveness.
[00:05:45.336 --> 00:05:46.397]  Well, no, I agree with you.
[00:05:46.417 --> 00:06:02.328]  In fact, I didn't confront the security guard, but I mean, he came up, he was acting like he was buying something, then he walked right over and looked at my shirt and then looked at the back because they'd looked at me on surveillance camera and, you know, come down to see this dangerous person with a Minuteman on his shirt.
[00:06:02.768 --> 00:06:08.232]  God forbid I wear this yellow one in public, but I thought that was made up and exaggerated.
[00:06:08.512 --> 00:06:09.993]  But I had all these shirts printed up
[00:06:11.753 --> 00:06:19.403]  And now I'm wearing them around town and other places and I'm experiencing it where, where, I mean, these cops have really been brainwashed.
[00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:23.107]  And exactly, they're having their futures destroyed as well, Mike.
[00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:26.832]  They should want to stand with the Gadsden flag.
[00:06:26.872 --> 00:06:28.474]  They should want to stand with Paul Revere.
[00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:30.417]  I mean, how is Paul Revere bad?
[00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:44.896]  Well you're absolutely right and and the point is I think we need to start rethinking our approach to the ordinary man in the street police because you're right they've been brainwashed and given all these reports that say anybody wearing any of these t-shirts we're the bad guys.
[00:06:45.296 --> 00:06:54.742]  So rather than reinforce that I think we need to rethink some of our designs to where we say we're you and I are really the same against this common enemy.
[00:06:54.762 --> 00:07:01.466]  Do you have a half million dollars lying around you're not doing anything with because that's your share of the federal government's debt.
[00:07:01.806 --> 00:07:04.068]  That they've borrowed and stuck you with the payments.
[00:07:04.548 --> 00:07:07.810]  And obviously it needs to be rendered much more simple and elegant for a t-shirt.
[00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:17.017]  But the idea is that if we don't reinforce these preconceptions they've been brainwashed with, we stand a much better chance of drawing them over to our side of the issues.
[00:07:18.058 --> 00:07:19.099]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:20.680]  A lot's going on.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.224]  Greg Pallast and others are reporting, basically breaking down the same thing that we've said.
[00:07:26.985 --> 00:07:28.085]  We have the government documents.
[00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:29.626]  GM was planning years ago
[00:07:30.626 --> 00:07:37.089]  to move to China and Brazil and just, you know, to become completely global.
[00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:42.171]  The media keeps billing it as if it's a bankruptcy and socialism and a government bailout.
[00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:42.992]  It's not.
[00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:46.553]  It's just like tax incentives for companies to leave the United States.
[00:07:46.573 --> 00:07:56.178]  This is a tax incentive and under the NAFTA and GATT rules, under the World Trade Organization rules, General Motors cannot use bailout money
[00:07:58.519 --> 00:07:59.900]  To carry out U.S.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.540]  operations.
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.342]  It has to be open to bidding and be spread out globally.
[00:08:04.883 --> 00:08:09.025]  And that's why they said they can't use the economic stimulus money domestically.
[00:08:09.045 --> 00:08:11.506]  It has to be spent internationally.
[00:08:12.107 --> 00:08:23.173]  And so to see GM fall, to see Chrysler fall in the last month, to see the government now saying they're going to buy up basically the newspapers, where do you see all this going, Mike Rivera?
[00:08:24.597 --> 00:08:33.401]  Well, I noticed this morning that our manufacturing index continues to decline and the bottom line, fundamental truth is, if you're not making products to sell, you cannot save the economy.
[00:08:34.602 --> 00:08:38.724]  It really does seem as if the government simply wants to buy up and own everything.
[00:08:39.904 --> 00:08:40.705]  It's amazing.
[00:08:40.785 --> 00:08:43.366]  The USSR fell and Russia became capitalist.
[00:08:43.826 --> 00:08:53.214]  Now, we seem to be heading into this totally communistic, socialistic, fascistic state where the government will own everything, we'll all be technically government employees.
[00:08:53.535 --> 00:08:59.400]  But the bottom line is, if we're not manufacturing, if we're not making products to sell, we can't save this economy.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.601]  We just can't.
[00:09:00.981 --> 00:09:08.708]  And every day we get another news report about how the banks are showing profits, not because they're really profitable, but they're playing more of these bookkeeping tricks.
[00:09:09.168 --> 00:09:10.189]  I don't think so.
[00:09:25.456 --> 00:09:29.378]  Well, the reason that I've known this was by design was because, Mike, and I know you're
[00:09:51.428 --> 00:09:53.769]  You're not a dull knife yourself there in the drawer.
[00:09:54.489 --> 00:10:03.433]  That the IMF and World Bank are the international fronts for the private banking family syndicates that are on the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bundesbank and others on record.
[00:10:03.974 --> 00:10:06.515]  And they go around and do the same thing they're doing to the West.
[00:10:06.575 --> 00:10:11.397]  They've done to third world countries in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia and the Middle East.
[00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:19.114]  Though the Middle East knew what this was and hasn't been as trusting, and so they're not being hurt as bad by it.
[00:10:19.134 --> 00:10:23.678]  So they get the old-fashioned military invasion because they won't be economically captured.
[00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:28.502]  Serbia wouldn't take a globalist-controlled central bank, so you saw what happened there.
[00:10:28.542 --> 00:10:30.243]  They hired a bunch of Muslims to attack them.
[00:10:30.483 --> 00:10:32.705]  Then when they defended themselves, they said, oh look, they're evil.
[00:10:33.025 --> 00:10:38.450]  And then Al-Qaeda, the CIA's favorite attack dog, went in against them.
[00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.732]  So this happens over and over again.
[00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:44.468]  That's how we know that it's engineered.
[00:10:44.488 --> 00:10:50.497]  Then we have all their different IMF and World Bank documents where they talk about how they want to bring in this crisis to offer the solution.
[00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.862]  And George Soros is bragging about how he loves this.
[00:10:53.882 --> 00:10:55.083]  This is the culmination of his life.
[00:10:55.324 --> 00:10:56.486]  He's having a great crisis.
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:09.584]  It is, it's rather amazing but you know where I think they're going to stumble on this is I think most people around the world are recognizing that what turned an American economic downturn into a global catastrophe was globalism.
[00:11:09.884 --> 00:11:17.006]  That all this interlinking between countries and I think when they stand up there and say we need more globalism as the solution I think a lot of people are going to get
[00:11:17.486 --> 00:11:19.530]  They're going to be very, very distrustful of this.
[00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:20.131]  They're going to balk.
[00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:21.773]  They're going to say, this doesn't make any sense.
[00:11:22.154 --> 00:11:31.689]  You know, if we've got a house on fire over here, let's not go down the street, chop up the other houses and throw the wood on the fire to try and put it out, which is basically what globalism amounts to.
[00:11:32.876 --> 00:11:33.457]  Absolutely.
[00:11:33.477 --> 00:11:38.320]  You know, there's a host of issues to discuss with Mike Rivera today in the 40 minutes we have left with him.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.283]  We're also going to be taking your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:42.983 --> 00:11:47.447]  But Mike, when we come back, what are some of the issues you think are most important you'd like to discuss today?
[00:11:48.376 --> 00:11:51.898]  Well, obviously the torture scandal is not going to be going away anytime soon.
[00:11:51.938 --> 00:11:53.719]  We definitely need to deal with that.
[00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:57.781]  We definitely need to deal with the fact that the U.S.
[00:11:57.841 --> 00:12:00.943]  government's handling of the economy is exactly opposite what it should be.
[00:12:00.963 --> 00:12:06.806]  You are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[00:12:07.067 --> 00:12:07.907]  Take a deep breath.
[00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:15.131]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:16.352]  Have a glass of water.
[00:12:16.892 --> 00:12:22.217]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other chemicals?
[00:12:22.557 --> 00:12:23.358]  Of course you can't.
[00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:28.462]  The air that you breathe and the water you drink should help maintain good health, not take away from it.
[00:12:28.762 --> 00:12:37.009]  AirAndAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these toxins.
[00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:43.014]  AirAndAqua.com carries whole house air and water purification systems, air conditioners, showerhead
[00:12:43.134 --> 00:12:47.115]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:13:07.362 --> 00:13:12.727]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:19.432]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.554]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:13:21.714 --> 00:13:24.096]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:13:24.176 --> 00:13:35.065]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:13:37.353 --> 00:13:38.614]  It's not about left or right.
[00:13:39.014 --> 00:13:40.374]  It's about a one world government.
[00:13:40.874 --> 00:13:47.177]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.200]  The Obama Deception.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.801]  The people strike back.
[00:14:00.433 --> 00:14:06.658]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:14:07.099 --> 00:14:14.885]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:14:15.225 --> 00:14:20.810]  Is this a flaw free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.092]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:14:23.372 --> 00:14:28.136]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:14:28.476 --> 00:14:33.219]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.563]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.064]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:43.227]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:14:43.648 --> 00:14:45.009]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:14:48.522 --> 00:14:51.088]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:53.213]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:53.313 --> 00:14:53.533]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:15:00.063 --> 00:15:04.044]  Less than a century ago, half of the American public grew much of their own food.
[00:15:04.325 --> 00:15:08.446]  Today, it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own food.
[00:15:08.726 --> 00:15:13.008]  During the Great Depression, over 18 million people suffered from starvation.
[00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:19.430]  And as America continues down its current path, for many, the reality of another depression is a very serious concern.
[00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:27.319]  With massive layoffs and unemployment at record levels, growing your own food will help you save money that you'd normally spend at the grocery store.
[00:15:27.619 --> 00:15:33.746]  Invest in your family's future by stocking up with your very own supply of seeds available from getseeds.net.
[00:15:34.707 --> 00:15:34.987]  I think so.
[00:16:37.273 --> 00:16:42.907]  I'm just glad that I'm not buffaloed, bamboozled, hoodwinked, shanghaied.
[00:16:44.383 --> 00:16:49.445]  Conned, manipulated, I'm glad that I know who the globalists are, what their plan is, and I'm aware of it.
[00:16:50.285 --> 00:16:57.508]  And I have a desire, as Thomas Jefferson said, to set bushfires in the minds of men and women everywhere to realize what's really happening.
[00:16:57.768 --> 00:17:06.331]  Yeah, the torture issue isn't going away because they tried to say it isn't torture, but everybody knows waterboarding and raping people's children in front of them, as the Army's own report admits, is torture.
[00:17:06.712 --> 00:17:11.773]  Now it comes out, what we already knew, the Democrats were complicit all along in going along with this.
[00:17:12.234 --> 00:17:12.994]  Bush protects
[00:17:13.494 --> 00:17:16.477]  Them, when they're out of office, they protect him when he's out of office.
[00:17:17.178 --> 00:17:21.502]  And really, I think the illusion that was Obama is now imploding.
[00:17:21.522 --> 00:17:26.627]  You know, even Lou Rockwell was on the show Friday and he said he had supported Obama early on, believing all this crap.
[00:17:27.007 --> 00:17:27.828]  You had done that.
[00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:33.954]  But I think now the fact that we've all been betrayed only illustrates how both parties are controlled.
[00:17:34.174 --> 00:17:36.597]  Where do you see this torture scandal going?
[00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:40.241]  Well, it's going to keep on growing.
[00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:42.002]  It's going to go on festering.
[00:17:42.042 --> 00:17:53.610]  I think Barack Obama committed a major mistake by trying to block the release of these most recent photographs because, first of all, it shows he's an accessory after the fact in war crimes.
[00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.211]  He's complicit in the cover-up.
[00:17:55.831 --> 00:18:09.755]  And more to the point, now that he's gone to the Supreme Court and they've given him an additional 30 days to file documents regarding whether or not these pictures should be sealed, it gives the world another 30 days to let their imaginations run free about what the pictures might show.
[00:18:10.095 --> 00:18:12.796]  And after 30 days, no matter what pictures are released,
[00:18:13.536 --> 00:18:17.737]  People are going to assume they've been altered, they've been airbrushed, they've been faked, they've been sanitized.
[00:18:18.157 --> 00:18:20.518]  So it's just made matters all that much worse.
[00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:27.660]  We're getting confirmation reports from other sources that these pictures do indeed show the sexual assault of people.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:40.343]  And the bottom line is that the US government's credibility on the torture issue or the enhanced interrogation is that somehow these people deserved it and that somehow these methods were necessary to protect lives.
[00:18:40.663 --> 00:18:49.311]  But when you get into situations of children being sodomized in front of their mothers, nobody's going to believe that that had anything to do with protecting national security.
[00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:55.357]  And the bottom line is, behind all of it, the real core issue that is the most protected point in this scandal.
[00:18:55.957 --> 00:18:59.119]  Is the fact that, you know, we've had Chinese come out and admit it.
[00:18:59.379 --> 00:19:01.080]  Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.701]  We all know there were no weapons of mass destruction.
[00:19:03.741 --> 00:19:08.504]  The entire war in Iraq hinged on the claim that Iraq was aiding Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:08.644 --> 00:19:14.347]  We now know that was based on a single confession extracted under torture.
[00:19:14.687 --> 00:19:19.530]  And as soon as the torture was over, the guy retracted the confession and said, look, I just said that to get you to stop.
[00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:28.700]  And now that, of course, people are trying to find out just how we got into Iraq, this individual has conveniently committed suicide or been suicided.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.083]  And so this is the real scandal behind it all.
[00:19:32.164 --> 00:19:35.367]  Forget all the sodomy and the rape and all the rest of the stuff.
[00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:41.034]  It's the fact that the entire war in Iraq and 4,000 dead Americans and thousands more crippled
[00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:44.837]  Was based on a confession extracted under torture.
[00:19:45.097 --> 00:19:47.399]  We had no real legitimate reason to be there.
[00:19:47.459 --> 00:19:50.801]  We have no real legitimate reason to remain.
[00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:52.342]  Why are we still in there?
[00:19:52.622 --> 00:19:55.665]  Why is Obama talking about extending our troop presence there?
[00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.346]  Strengthening our troop presence there?
[00:19:57.666 --> 00:20:01.189]  Another hundred billion dollar war appropriation just passed Congress.
[00:20:01.589 --> 00:20:01.949]  Why?
[00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:03.170]  What are we doing there?
[00:20:03.431 --> 00:20:06.313]  The entire war is based on a lie.
[00:20:06.753 --> 00:20:07.894]  We are the bad guys.
[00:20:07.954 --> 00:20:10.115]  We are the aggressors in this current war.
[00:20:10.415 --> 00:20:17.058]  And if you look at the history of the 20th century, every major war was ultimately lost by the country that started it.
[00:20:17.438 --> 00:20:18.899]  So guess where that sets us up?
[00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:22.081]  I'm not surprised our soldiers are committing suicide in such numbers.
[00:20:22.121 --> 00:20:23.241]  They know they're the bad guys.
[00:20:25.242 --> 00:20:28.964]  Well, it's amazing to see this unfolding.
[00:20:29.524 --> 00:20:30.365]  And on top of that,
[00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:40.103]  The media is playing a game here when they act like they didn't know it was torture and they have a debate about whether it's torture or not, or whether torture was ordered.
[00:20:40.343 --> 00:20:49.535]  We have all the White House memos, but before we had the orders, and before we found out Pelosi was in on it, and that she tried to lie about that,
[00:20:50.791 --> 00:21:04.131]  I remember in the three or four months after 9-11, Washington Post articles that are in my film Road to Tyranny, where they thought they had the public where they wanted them, with 90 plus percent approval ratings, so they tried to sell pure evil at that point, and it said,
[00:21:05.424 --> 00:21:31.354]  detainees children uh... being used to get answers and then it said we're quote putting pressure and the article on the say torture of children in front of their parents to get answers and so and i'm and i'll never forget being out in hollywood because i was going on a national tv show out there and I'll never forget being in a hotel room watching a press conference with Rumsfeld bragging how they were torturing.
[00:21:31.754 --> 00:21:33.275]  Why doesn't the media go get
[00:21:34.719 --> 00:21:38.821]  All those clips of him saying that, and all those articles, and then there's no more debate.
[00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:39.701]  We arrest these people.
[00:21:39.961 --> 00:21:42.223]  Because the whole government, both parties are involved.
[00:21:42.703 --> 00:21:46.685]  We'll talk to Mike Rivero and take your phone calls on the other side of this long segment that's coming up.
[00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:48.405]  His website's whatreallyhappened.com.
[00:21:48.706 --> 00:21:50.786]  Our sites are infowarriors.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:21:51.467 --> 00:21:52.387]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.867 --> 00:21:54.468]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:55.409 --> 00:21:58.090]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.089 --> 00:22:06.072]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:22:06.292 --> 00:22:10.075]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:10.315 --> 00:22:15.939]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:16.219 --> 00:22:16.679]  It's true.
[00:22:16.859 --> 00:22:21.082]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:21.282 --> 00:22:27.667]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:22:27.827 --> 00:22:28.267]  Number four,
[00:22:28.487 --> 00:22:31.130]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.794]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:22:35.055 --> 00:22:35.275]  Number 5.
[00:22:35.916 --> 00:22:39.540]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:45.246]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[00:23:03.372 --> 00:23:08.018]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:23:08.119 --> 00:23:10.862]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:23:11.083 --> 00:23:13.966]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:23:14.127 --> 00:23:18.853]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:23:19.053 --> 00:23:19.994]  If you simply prepare.
[00:23:20.194 --> 00:23:23.196]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:23:23.436 --> 00:23:30.340]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:24:04.349 --> 00:24:08.673]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:24:08.873 --> 00:24:16.760]  It's called Proto-Grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.903]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:24:20.183 --> 00:24:27.711]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:24:27.811 --> 00:24:33.417]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:24:33.657 --> 00:24:39.203]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:24:39.483 --> 00:24:42.727]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:24:43.007 --> 00:24:46.372]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:24:46.612 --> 00:24:51.659]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Sheep superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:54.543]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:24:54.603 --> 00:24:54.784]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:25:19.586 --> 00:25:20.487]  We are back live.
[00:25:20.527 --> 00:25:21.808]  Mike Rivero is our guest.
[00:25:21.828 --> 00:25:24.150]  Going to your phone calls in T-minus five minutes.
[00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:34.299]  And I want to get into how Mike sees this collapse, this control collapse, the economy unfolding and developing.
[00:25:35.801 --> 00:25:40.725]  Before we go back to Mike Rivero, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[00:25:41.165 --> 00:25:42.346]  One of them is Home Gain.
[00:25:43.516 --> 00:25:47.519]  And Homegain's website is H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.202]  It is an absolutely free website.
[00:25:51.322 --> 00:25:54.264]  Homegain dot com is absolutely, totally free.
[00:25:54.864 --> 00:25:55.785]  It is sponsor driven.
[00:25:57.006 --> 00:25:57.606]  Great folks.
[00:25:58.026 --> 00:25:59.567]  Been around for more than ten years.

[00:26:05.432 --> 00:26:12.296]  If you forget the website address, you can just link through there at InfoWars dot com by clicking on Max the Orange Homegain Gorilla.
[00:26:13.226 --> 00:26:14.047]  HomeGain.com.

[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.265]  Just a lot of neat things like that at H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[00:26:33.246 --> 00:26:36.449]  And one other sponsor I want to tell you about is Survival Seed Bank.
[00:26:37.728 --> 00:26:43.450]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.291]  There have been a lot of times in U.S.
[00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:50.553]  history, pilgrims for example, when seeds have the highest value barter item of anything out there.
[00:26:51.513 --> 00:26:53.234]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds.
[00:26:53.254 --> 00:26:55.635]  You know, they passed a law in Europe where you gotta have a license to own them.
[00:26:56.195 --> 00:27:00.196]  Waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[00:27:00.657 --> 00:27:02.077]  Governments are storing seeds.
[00:27:02.117 --> 00:27:02.457]  The U.N.
[00:27:02.497 --> 00:27:03.198]  is storing seeds.
[00:27:03.558 --> 00:27:06.379]  Globalists of every stripe are storing seeds near the Arctic Circle.
[00:27:07.179 --> 00:27:08.380]  Why do you think this is?
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.240]  You know why.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.521]  Control and power.
[00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:16.444]  Solutions from science is trying to get the seeds out of the globalist hands and into the hands of the people, one seed bank at a time.
[00:27:16.804 --> 00:27:19.246]  Check out their website at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:27:19.526 --> 00:27:21.527]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:27:21.547 --> 00:27:22.448]  That's 877-327-0365 or survivalseedbank.com.
[00:27:22.468 --> 00:27:24.049]  Okay, let us now go back to Mike Rivera.
[00:27:35.568 --> 00:27:58.479]  Shifting gears to Europe, here the establishment and the Bilderberg Group was in the EU Observer and other papers a few months ago, as I'm sure you saw, being a newshound, bragging at the end avenue on the chairman of Bilderberg, oh we set up the Euro by covert action, we're setting up the North American Union by covert action, the transatlantic treaty organization signed by George Bush in 2007, that's all covered in Endgame.
[00:27:59.319 --> 00:28:03.261]  It's all out in the open and they laugh at us publicly knowing most people don't read the newspaper.
[00:28:05.202 --> 00:28:07.226]  And then spinning it that it's all for our own good.
[00:28:08.349 --> 00:28:11.776]  Here they just deny we're in a North American Union, though under treaty we've been in one since 2005.
[00:28:14.486 --> 00:28:18.929]  And then we have to fight for years admitting that there's a Napa Superhighway going in in Texas.
[00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:24.673]  The media denies it exists, then it admits it exists, but then says, okay, we're canceling it.
[00:28:24.873 --> 00:28:29.477]  But the third paragraph in the AP article a few months ago said, well, actually, they're getting rid of the name.
[00:28:29.877 --> 00:28:33.580]  They're just going to keep it and not give it a name and have it piece by piece.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.361]  But the whole project continues.
[00:28:36.161 --> 00:28:38.063]  Well, in Europe, it's another form of spin.
[00:28:38.103 --> 00:28:40.925]  And I want to ask you how we fight this and where you see this going.
[00:28:42.048 --> 00:28:45.215]  Because, as you know, Zelikow, the U.S.
[00:28:45.255 --> 00:28:52.190]  head of the World Bank, big neocon, came out in Bloomberg over the weekend and said, look, there's going to be a worldwide revolution.
[00:28:53.526 --> 00:28:56.707]  The trillions we've given to the banks, the people are going to find out we did it.
[00:28:56.967 --> 00:28:58.267]  He's speaking with incredible candor.
[00:28:58.467 --> 00:28:59.427]  They're going to come after us.
[00:29:00.128 --> 00:29:01.568]  And then he didn't really say anything after that.
[00:29:01.608 --> 00:29:08.749]  He just kind of made the announcement, kind of like he was a white-tailed deer throwing his tail up, you know, hightailing it, saying, look out, they're coming for us.
[00:29:09.129 --> 00:29:10.650]  So a lot of weird, mixed signals.
[00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:15.871]  But with Zelikow, but in Europe, every time they let him vote, as you know, in the Netherlands or in
[00:29:17.168 --> 00:29:24.533]  Ireland or in countries like France, the people say no by 70 plus percent.
[00:29:24.553 --> 00:29:26.854]  76 is the number that you usually see.
[00:29:27.054 --> 00:29:28.715]  They won't let the Brits vote on it.
[00:29:28.915 --> 00:29:31.177]  They're just bringing them under the regulations of it.
[00:29:31.857 --> 00:29:32.277]  That's why
[00:29:33.686 --> 00:29:37.467]  Jackie Smith said, you know, arrest talk show host if they come here.
[00:29:37.687 --> 00:29:39.027]  You're not allowed to criticize immigrants.
[00:29:39.067 --> 00:29:41.368]  Michael Savage, she was following EU rules.
[00:29:41.608 --> 00:29:46.529]  Well now, Reuters reports, poll finds Irish support EU's Libsyn Treaty rises.
[00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:48.390]  They're going to try to have another vote.
[00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:54.732]  And they did this last time, saying it was going to win last year in Ireland, and then it lost.
[00:29:55.152 --> 00:29:58.053]  So they, I mean, how do you deal with this level of deception?
[00:29:58.593 --> 00:29:59.493]  And where is all this going?
[00:30:00.322 --> 00:30:09.625]  Well, the good news is because these deceptions are being repeatedly exposed and people are seeing this incredible disconnect between what the corporate media is saying and the reality on the ground.
[00:30:10.226 --> 00:30:16.868]  I would cite as a local example some of these incredibly bogus polls, very obviously bogus polls we're seeing in the corporate media.
[00:30:18.028 --> 00:30:24.851]  I mean, the first rule of propaganda is for it to work.
[00:30:24.891 --> 00:30:25.991]  It's got to be believable.
[00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:31.413]  And our corporate media has gone so far past that line right now.
[00:30:31.573 --> 00:30:37.555]  And this is why they're losing audience and why people are coming over to the Alex Jones Show and the What Really Happened Show and they're coming to the blogosphere.
[00:30:38.115 --> 00:30:41.778]  Because the propaganda has reached an unbelievable level.
[00:30:42.059 --> 00:30:52.668]  Now, getting back to the situation about the economy, I think a big reason the people of the world are rejecting this globalism and these unions is for two reasons.
[00:30:52.928 --> 00:30:59.254]  One, they know it's not for their benefit, it's for the benefit of the banks, so they can have a bigger pile of money that they can siphon off of.
[00:30:59.955 --> 00:31:02.997]  And at bottom line, when you talk about a global governance,
[00:31:04.042 --> 00:31:05.784]  That's what Alexander the Great wanted.
[00:31:05.804 --> 00:31:06.905]  That's what Napoleon wanted.
[00:31:06.945 --> 00:31:07.946]  That's what Hitler wanted.
[00:31:08.387 --> 00:31:13.513]  And people understand that global governance is not about wise management of the globe.
[00:31:13.613 --> 00:31:21.141]  It's about some individual or some small group standing up on top of a monument built to their own glory and screaming, I am in control of it all.
[00:31:21.222 --> 00:31:22.203]  Am I not really cool?
[00:31:22.823 --> 00:31:26.225]  And I think we've kind of had enough of that sort of situation.
[00:31:26.926 --> 00:31:36.332]  And as I said before, the current economic downturn on the entire planet is because of globalism, and most people are smart enough to realize more globalism is not going to fix it.
[00:31:36.772 --> 00:31:49.580]  Now, interestingly enough, we brought up a concept at my own show yesterday, and I've been getting a ton of email about it, both pro and con, and it has to do with a little theory in international law called an odious debt, and what that is,
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.419]  This basically means that when a government ceases to operate,
[00:31:54.755 --> 00:32:04.960]  The debts incurred that were not for the benefit of the people are construed to be personal debts of the government officials themselves, and the people don't have to pay them back.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:05.721]  The U.S.
[00:32:05.861 --> 00:32:10.043]  used this to get Cuba off the hook for debts run up by the Spanish occupation.
[00:32:10.423 --> 00:32:14.825]  Mexico used this principle to repudiate the debts run up by the Emperor Maximilian.
[00:32:15.125 --> 00:32:22.109]  Basically what it means is that at some point in the future, if the government of the United States should collapse the way the USSR did,
[00:32:22.609 --> 00:32:36.959]  All of this money spent on wars of aggression, all these debts run up for the bailouts, all the money borrowed for walls and security and surveillance and all of this other stuff that didn't really improve the lot of the common people, we the people are not going to be held liable for that debt anymore.
[00:32:37.119 --> 00:32:43.123]  Well that's what I was going to get to next and I want you to continue with the punchline here with the key.
[00:32:44.324 --> 00:32:46.045]  But, I mean, that is so central.
[00:32:46.825 --> 00:32:48.886]  Not just odious debt, fraudulent debt.
[00:32:48.906 --> 00:32:53.488]  A contract that's fraudulent, a contract that's carried out through deception is null and void.
[00:32:53.829 --> 00:33:03.153]  And as a free human being, I don't own and I don't owe a half million dollars to foreign offshore banks.
[00:33:03.273 --> 00:33:04.013]  A, I don't have it.
[00:33:04.293 --> 00:33:06.615]  B, it was set up fraudulently.
[00:33:06.635 --> 00:33:09.316]  I mean, we even pay taxes to the offshore banks.
[00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:36.951]  to give them the money and then we pay interest on the money we pay taxes to give them this is the greatest ponzi scheme fraud they want to carry their ponzi scheme through to the next level through fraud so uh... it is fraudulent and that's why china and russia and europe and japan are saying can you guys pay this back because they know they can do the math we've gone from the average american owning
[00:33:37.971 --> 00:33:45.535]  Uh, you know, uh, more money and more assets than they did debts to being a total debtor nation in 2007.
[00:33:46.096 --> 00:33:54.400]  And at the worst debtor level we've been in our history, the previous record of a some debtor nation was in late 1933.
[00:33:56.121 --> 00:33:58.523]  And so we physically can't pay it back.
[00:33:58.603 --> 00:33:59.383]  It's fraudulent.
[00:33:59.744 --> 00:34:04.507]  The world knows that we all owe over a half million dollars and it's now going hyperbolic.
[00:34:04.767 --> 00:34:14.794]  It's going from a couple hundred thousand a year ago to 500,000 now and accelerating towards a million dollars in debt per American within two years, the Wall Street Journal reports.
[00:34:15.114 --> 00:34:19.938]  And no police state is going to be able to extract this out of the slaves.
[00:34:21.238 --> 00:34:22.419]  The country is imploding.
[00:34:22.459 --> 00:34:29.021]  The illegal aliens are bankrupting everything in the Southwest because they're in the social welfare net because they're not paid enough to live.
[00:34:29.482 --> 00:34:30.822]  I mean, this is all coming to a head.
[00:34:30.862 --> 00:34:32.803]  So where do you see all this going, Mike Rivera?
[00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:43.768]  Well, there's a fundamental principle about the debt-based currency system that we find at the heart of the Federal Reserve, and that is that the instant it goes into operation, more money is owed to the banks than is actually physically in existence.
[00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:47.191]  We talk about the federal government being $65 trillion in debt.
[00:34:47.551 --> 00:34:50.534]  Most of that is debt of money that is fictional.
[00:34:50.754 --> 00:34:52.816]  It never really existed in the first place.
[00:34:52.896 --> 00:35:04.529]  It is simply notes in a ledger that the interest is accruing over time, and so the money doesn't exist, and unless we go out and conquer other countries, we're never going to come up with it, and we have to collapse.
[00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:12.197]  The problem with bringing a global bank into line with the same debt-based currency where all money is borrowed from a central bank,
[00:35:12.697 --> 00:35:16.840]  When it gets to the point of collapse, there are no other places to go for money.
[00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:26.488]  So a global, debt-based, Federal Reserve-style bank inevitably will plunge the entire world into an incredible depression where we're going to wind up eating each other.
[00:35:26.748 --> 00:35:29.009]  And this is why it must be avoided at all costs.
[00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.671]  I agree with you.
[00:35:30.771 --> 00:35:36.875]  Let's take some calls from Mike Rivera, joining us from Hawaii via video cam right now, simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:39.803]  And at Genesis on the radio.
[00:35:40.263 --> 00:35:42.784]  Let's go ahead and talk to Peter in Iraq.
[00:35:42.865 --> 00:35:44.405]  Peter, thank you for holding.
[00:35:44.625 --> 00:35:45.226]  You're on the air.
[00:35:45.246 --> 00:35:49.308]  Hey, Alex.
[00:35:49.448 --> 00:35:53.530]  Jesse Ventura made a great point the other day, and I just want to bring it back up.
[00:35:53.971 --> 00:36:05.237]  He was saying that, and I know you're all about a bloodless, peaceful revolution, and he made a great point about how, oh, I'm too old to read and write and take back the military.
[00:36:05.737 --> 00:36:07.058]  Well, wouldn't you
[00:36:07.871 --> 00:36:21.464]  I think it would be a great idea to have people enlist in the military who are enlightened, who know what's going on, and then when they give the orders, it's like, sorry, I just work to uphold the Constitution, not any executive branch or anybody else.
[00:36:22.766 --> 00:36:27.911]  Yes, I mean, I've said that it's all... I mean, that's a very complex issue, and I want to get Mike Rivero's take on that as well.
[00:36:30.034 --> 00:36:50.828]  We know that as the police get more and more corrupt leadership, and as they're told to do more and more things that are unconstitutional, and as the media plays these mind games and legitimizes it all, that the stupid, ignorant, foolish, or wicked people, and there's a mix of all those, will stay in the police forces, the good ones will get out, and then you're left with a bunch of rotten apples.
[00:36:51.758 --> 00:36:52.958]  The same thing for the military.
[00:36:53.078 --> 00:37:03.160]  As they hire illegal aliens, as they hire criminals, as they kill military investigators, as the corruption gets worse and worse, the good people get out, and it's a race to the bottom.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:15.523]  But how can you expect good people to stay in when they're going to be sent on fraudulent missions, when they're going to be stuck in bad situations, where they're going to be given these experimental vaccines and shots?
[00:37:17.843 --> 00:37:20.104]  I think it's a good thing that there are a lot of good people in the military.
[00:37:21.658 --> 00:37:26.423]  At the same time, I wouldn't wish anybody to join this military that's controlled by offshore banks.
[00:37:26.483 --> 00:37:31.148]  I mean, we know that of any Democrat or any Republican, Ron Paul got the most money.
[00:37:31.869 --> 00:37:39.991]  I mean, Ron Paul got over 70% of the military contributions until he got out of the race, and then Obama got most of them because he was saying it in the war.
[00:37:40.652 --> 00:37:42.012]  So I know the troops are good.
[00:37:42.532 --> 00:37:48.254]  That's why they're trying to replace them with Blackwater and illegal aliens and felons.
[00:37:48.714 --> 00:37:50.415]  So it's a very complex question.
[00:37:50.475 --> 00:37:51.855]  I mean, I can't make that decision.
[00:37:52.255 --> 00:37:55.136]  I can't sit here and tell you what I think you should do.
[00:37:55.196 --> 00:37:56.637]  I think that's for you to decide.
[00:37:56.917 --> 00:37:57.497]  Mike Rivera?
[00:37:58.377 --> 00:37:59.537]  Yeah, I absolutely agree.
[00:37:59.637 --> 00:38:06.259]  Unfortunately, the moral and the immoral are mutually exclusive societies, and neither one tolerates the presence of the other.
[00:38:06.599 --> 00:38:11.840]  So once the government and the military and corporate culture starts to go bad, it goes all the way bad.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.761]  They go out of their way to eject anybody who's not going to go along with the program.
[00:38:15.801 --> 00:38:17.102]  We saw that with Cynthia McKinney.
[00:38:17.382 --> 00:38:18.542]  We saw it with Ron Paul.
[00:38:19.062 --> 00:38:22.863]  It is almost impossible for an honest, moral person
[00:38:23.243 --> 00:38:24.244]  To stay in Congress.
[00:38:24.264 --> 00:38:28.647]  They can get in there for a first time, but they very quickly find themselves on the outs.
[00:38:29.187 --> 00:38:36.553]  It is sort of like, remember the high school clique, where all the popular rich kids would get together and they could do whatever they wanted and get away with it all?
[00:38:36.913 --> 00:38:38.214]  That's basically what the U.S.
[00:38:38.234 --> 00:38:39.095]  government has become.
[00:38:39.515 --> 00:38:40.696]  It's the socias.
[00:38:41.036 --> 00:38:41.997]  It's the privileged.
[00:38:42.317 --> 00:38:49.623]  And they basically see themselves as inheritors of the rulership of not only the United States, but of the entire world.
[00:38:50.323 --> 00:38:53.906]  And any sacrifice to that objective is perfectly justified.
[00:38:54.186 --> 00:38:59.650]  We're seeing just in the economic policies here in the United States, there is no respect left for the working class people.
[00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.532]  There's no respect even for the middle class people.
[00:39:03.273 --> 00:39:11.379]  The entire bailout consists of taking trillions of dollars from the American people to give to the banks so the banks can loan it back to the American people at interest.
[00:39:11.699 --> 00:39:13.140]  That doesn't really make any sense.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:17.243]  And there's no talk about bringing back manufacturing on which the entire economy
[00:39:17.363 --> 00:39:18.204]  No, you're right.
[00:39:18.324 --> 00:39:22.767]  Everything else is being sacrificed on the altar of globalism, which is what they want.
[00:39:23.028 --> 00:39:24.829]  They want a consolidated system.
[00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:28.212]  You know, I just hope when you get back from Iraq, Peter, there's a country to come back to.
[00:39:28.893 --> 00:39:30.154]  Anything else from Iraq, Peter?
[00:39:32.275 --> 00:39:43.425]  Well, I mean, if you really expect the people to stand up and fight, I mean, they have to know how to, even if it's a support job, medic, or whatever.
[00:39:44.364 --> 00:39:51.749]  Or, I mean, I'm not saying my generation, or even if it's beyond my generation, has, can't, you know, isn't going to have to make sacrifices.
[00:39:52.149 --> 00:39:56.031]  If you're going to have a revolution, if you need... Well, I'll tell you what's going to happen.
[00:39:56.432 --> 00:39:57.572]  People are going to try to CPS...
[00:39:58.922 --> 00:40:00.463]  People's kids, and it's happening more and more.
[00:40:00.783 --> 00:40:01.784]  I see it in the news every week.
[00:40:01.984 --> 00:40:03.004]  And people are just going to kill them.
[00:40:03.805 --> 00:40:07.107]  And cops are going to stop people at a checkpoint, and the citizens are just going to get out.
[00:40:07.207 --> 00:40:08.488]  And it's already starting to happen.
[00:40:08.808 --> 00:40:10.509]  And the media kind of keeps it quiet.
[00:40:11.169 --> 00:40:12.530]  But you see the reports all the time.
[00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:13.551]  It's usually old vets.
[00:40:13.631 --> 00:40:14.712]  Korean War, Vietnam.
[00:40:15.352 --> 00:40:21.115]  Most of them are dead now, but they've had a couple cases in Austin where World War II vets would get pulled over and harassed by cops in Hays County.
[00:40:21.596 --> 00:40:23.257]  And the old vet would just get out and kill them.
[00:40:23.737 --> 00:40:26.258]  You know, I'd say, buddy, I'm not your slave that's in Nazi Germany.
[00:40:26.278 --> 00:40:26.679]  You're dead.
[00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:34.086]  And, you know, the cop can argue about that all day and have the media say the old man was bad, but at the end of the day, there's going to be a lot of blood.
[00:40:34.887 --> 00:40:36.008]  And the system knows that.
[00:40:36.708 --> 00:40:41.153]  And, you know, look, if we're self-sufficient, they can't beat us.
[00:40:41.173 --> 00:40:44.015]  That's why they want to shut down the farms and ranches and get control.
[00:40:44.836 --> 00:40:51.440]  And, uh, you know, if we try to have a Continental Congress or something like that, they're going to send feds in, they'd stage a truck bomb outside and say, we did it.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.562]  We've got to grassroots take over the counties and cities.
[00:40:54.962 --> 00:40:57.643]  These big centralized assaults aren't going to work.
[00:40:57.663 --> 00:41:01.426]  We've got to try to keep it peaceful as long as we can, but they're not going to be peaceful.
[00:41:01.706 --> 00:41:02.806]  These guys are arrogant.
[00:41:03.107 --> 00:41:04.587]  They never have lost in the past.
[00:41:04.607 --> 00:41:05.768]  This is what always happens.
[00:41:06.068 --> 00:41:08.710]  They're going to start fights with us and you're going to know.
[00:41:09.727 --> 00:41:16.872]  You're going to know, you know, as more WACOs happen, as more things happen like that, you're just going to have more and more people say, I'm done.
[00:41:16.892 --> 00:41:22.876]  And you're going to have more massacres of kids getting shot and people dying in ambulances because the cops won't let them get to the hospital.
[00:41:23.237 --> 00:41:25.538]  And you're just going to have more and more of this is going to happen.
[00:41:26.019 --> 00:41:27.880]  And it's probably going to be a war.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:31.683]  I mean, if you really want to know, folks, it's probably going to end up in a shooting war in this country.
[00:41:31.903 --> 00:41:33.064]  And I wish that wasn't the case.
[00:41:33.784 --> 00:41:38.446]  Because I've had my butt kicked and I've, you know, lived a little bit.
[00:41:38.486 --> 00:41:43.988]  I know it's not fun and not macho, but it is what it is and I'm not licking boots and I'm not going along with this crap anymore.
[00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:45.529]  And so it is what it is.
[00:41:46.089 --> 00:41:49.710]  And so the troops need to decide whose side they're on and what they're going to do.
[00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:50.791]  Anything else from Iraq?
[00:41:50.831 --> 00:41:51.071]  Peter?
[00:41:52.751 --> 00:41:55.352]  Well, if you don't know how to fight, you're going to be cut down like fodder.
[00:41:55.372 --> 00:41:57.553]  I mean, that's pretty much it.
[00:41:57.613 --> 00:41:59.874]  Just because you can shoot a gun doesn't mean you know what you're doing.
[00:42:02.565 --> 00:42:13.455]  Listen, I understand you're over there in Iraq dealing with the Iraqis and all the rest of them, but the French Resistance caused the Nazis a lot of problems and they'd already been a disarmed public.
[00:42:13.915 --> 00:42:14.876]  It's like moose hunting.
[00:42:15.196 --> 00:42:18.619]  You know, in moose hunting there's a lottery and one in five guys gets a moose ticket.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:26.466]  I mean, if people actually decided to go after the police and military, let's say there's two million of them, let's say there's three million of them,
[00:42:27.406 --> 00:42:30.107]  I mean, let's say 5 million Americans decided to go moose hunting.
[00:42:30.407 --> 00:42:31.267]  It's over very quickly.
[00:42:31.527 --> 00:42:32.687]  All you've got to get is one moose.
[00:42:36.208 --> 00:42:37.088]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:42:39.049 --> 00:42:39.309]  Peter?
[00:42:39.889 --> 00:42:54.472]  Yeah, but uh... Oh, absolutely, but if you value your own individual life, you might not want to know what you're doing, so... The revolution might live on, we might, as a whole, win, but if you value your individual life, you might want to know what you're doing.
[00:42:55.373 --> 00:42:56.354]  No, stay there.
[00:42:56.374 --> 00:42:58.175]  I want to hear more of what you have to say with Mike Rivero.
[00:42:58.195 --> 00:43:04.480]  Stay with us.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.400]  Newsflash!
[00:43:05.761 --> 00:43:08.222]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[00:43:08.603 --> 00:43:12.606]  The dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[00:43:14.029 --> 00:43:17.972]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[00:43:18.012 --> 00:43:22.215]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[00:43:22.636 --> 00:43:29.441]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy food.
[00:43:29.641 --> 00:43:37.727]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced price.
[00:43:37.967 --> 00:43:41.790]  So you and your family have a long-term food solution.
[00:43:43.271 --> 00:43:46.934]  The choice between starvation and freedom is made by you.
[00:43:47.054 --> 00:43:48.175]  Right now.
[00:43:48.235 --> 00:43:50.577]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.

[00:43:56.482 --> 00:43:58.544]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[00:44:01.306 --> 00:44:03.868]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:44:04.474 --> 00:44:06.596]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:44:07.097 --> 00:44:14.084]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:20.852]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:44:21.252 --> 00:44:23.094]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:44:23.234 --> 00:44:25.656]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:44:25.736 --> 00:44:36.765]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:44:37.325 --> 00:44:38.606]  It's not about left or right.
[00:44:39.006 --> 00:44:40.388]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:44:40.848 --> 00:44:47.073]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:44:56.006 --> 00:44:57.167]  The Obama Deception.
[00:44:57.587 --> 00:44:58.849]  The people strike back.
[00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:05.595]  The word catastrophe is defined as a sudden and widespread disaster.
[00:45:05.856 --> 00:45:08.979]  The only way to be truly ready is to prepare yourself now.
[00:45:13.203 --> 00:45:13.743]  We're good to go.

[00:45:51.063 --> 00:45:51.403]  That's 1-888-654-3447.
[00:46:10.475 --> 00:46:13.077]  This is going to be a war of ideas, even if it gets physical.
[00:46:13.817 --> 00:46:16.499]  It's going to be about who is seen in the right, who is going to be seen in the wrong.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.243]  And as long as we have the population with us, we're going to win this war against globalism.
[00:46:21.803 --> 00:46:23.324]  But we have to tell that story.
[00:46:23.344 --> 00:46:28.248]  We have to explain the control grid, who the globalists are, what their plan is, what they've done.
[00:46:29.669 --> 00:46:36.574]  You explain to the public that cancer's up several thousand percent from 50 years ago because they're putting cancer viruses in their shots?
[00:46:36.634 --> 00:46:37.834]  We're going to have the army we need.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.062]  And then the Dian's going to stop.
[00:46:42.083 --> 00:46:42.904]  We're under attack.
[00:46:42.924 --> 00:46:44.025]  We're under military attack.
[00:46:44.405 --> 00:46:47.848]  People just have to have the will to be able to admit how serious this is.
[00:46:47.888 --> 00:46:58.237]  Coming up at the 20 after next hour, I'm going to, for 40 minutes, break down just a small snapshot of the Cashless Society control grid, how it ties into cyber security.
[00:46:59.158 --> 00:46:59.438]  Okay?
[00:47:00.697 --> 00:47:02.138]  So I'm going to spend 40 minutes on this.
[00:47:02.198 --> 00:47:04.379]  I've done a lot of research and that's coming up.
[00:47:04.599 --> 00:47:06.360]  We've got this segment and the next with Mike Rivero.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.642]  I want to go to Kurt, Roger, Todd, Jeremy, Steve and others.
[00:47:10.002 --> 00:47:19.827]  But Peter, you know, as they teach in the military, I know if your boot's on the ground they're probably not teaching you this, but the point is 90% of war is psychological.
[00:47:20.868 --> 00:47:26.751]  We do need to reach out to the military and police before it's too late, but a lot of them are on power trips or too far gone, especially in police forces.
[00:47:28.235 --> 00:47:51.906]  uh... and and and you know training is fine and dandy and uh... it's great but the problem is the feds are all over that type of training insert their people who call for violence and send folks to prison so if you are going to train, train with people you've known for years people you trust and call it a shooting club a tactical shooting club and don't make it all secret agenty you know just oh we go out to the deer camp and you know we do you know we do this
[00:47:52.846 --> 00:48:08.636]  uh... and you can you know read up on the french resistance and others in books like total resistance and guerrilla warfare but this is an urban guerrilla warfare is a little bit different first thing i told militia stop wearing camouflage i see him in the cities and camo you know the city's camo is a sports jacket and a tie
[00:48:09.076 --> 00:48:10.838]  And, you know, you're real calm and, hi, how you doing?
[00:48:11.198 --> 00:48:14.982]  That's, that's, that's, if things ever went to that, that's, that's, that's your uniform, folks.
[00:48:15.383 --> 00:48:17.605]  It's a button-up shirt and, you know, hi, how you doing?
[00:48:18.225 --> 00:48:20.328]  Ah, you better, ah, no, I don't want to get into that.
[00:48:20.368 --> 00:48:25.273]  The point is, is that we don't want to sit there and think too much even about going to that level.
[00:48:25.633 --> 00:48:27.395]  We want to try to stop things politically.
[00:48:28.156 --> 00:48:29.217]  And things will work themselves.
[00:48:29.257 --> 00:48:32.280]  I mean, Mike Rivera, before I go back to the caller to finish up, any comments on what we're saying?
[00:48:32.898 --> 00:48:33.838]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:33.859 --> 00:48:40.102]  I mean, we need to avoid violence as long as possible because violence will only justify further repression by the government.
[00:48:40.342 --> 00:48:46.285]  We know the government likes to plant people within the peace movement to be violent so the media can attack us.
[00:48:46.585 --> 00:48:50.767]  I mean, look at all these so-called phony terrorist groups that were set up by the FBI informants.
[00:48:51.047 --> 00:48:53.028]  This is just the way the other side likes to play.
[00:48:53.328 --> 00:48:55.590]  And so we need to avoid getting sucked into that.
[00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:56.330]  But now they get caught!
[00:48:56.610 --> 00:49:04.237]  Now, it used to take us years to expose that 93 was a fake deal and that 96 was a fake deal in Miami.
[00:49:04.277 --> 00:49:05.458]  Now it comes out in days.
[00:49:05.738 --> 00:49:09.161]  It's totally fake with the FBI leading the group, commanding it.
[00:49:09.641 --> 00:49:17.068]  And it comes out that cops everywhere, from Canada to England to the US, dress up like anarchists to discredit the peaceful demonstrators.
[00:49:17.108 --> 00:49:18.349]  I mean, the truth's coming out!
[00:49:19.332 --> 00:49:20.353]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:49:20.433 --> 00:49:35.501]  We're a much more educated and sophisticated society, and I think our greatest hope for the future is that the powers that be, let me rephrase that, the powers that imagine they are, still don't get how the entire world has been changed by the alternative media and by the blogosphere.
[00:49:35.801 --> 00:49:39.543]  They don't understand we're much more aware, sophisticated, and skeptical.
[00:49:39.963 --> 00:49:43.145]  And they can even try to shut the web down now as they're openly announcing.
[00:49:43.785 --> 00:49:44.666]  It's still too late!
[00:49:44.726 --> 00:49:45.226]  It's over!
[00:49:45.506 --> 00:49:47.027]  Everybody knows you're criminal liars!
[00:49:47.547 --> 00:49:48.568]  Anything else, Peter?
[00:49:50.956 --> 00:50:04.815]  Yeah, um, wasn't there a, uh, excuse me for not remembering his name, there was a, uh, General, uh, American General Mort, uh, who was a Medal of Honor recipient from World War I, and prior to World War II, wasn't, uh, there a- Smedley Butler!
[00:50:07.614 --> 00:50:08.074]  Exactly.
[00:50:08.395 --> 00:50:10.016]  And how did he get to that position?
[00:50:10.736 --> 00:50:17.601]  I'm sure all he did was keep his mouth shut and not scream 9-11 was an inside job every 20 seconds.
[00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:19.002]  Do your job.
[00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:24.165]  And when it comes down and you know what's going on and the water comes down, that's when you do it.
[00:50:24.225 --> 00:50:27.708]  But if you're labeled, oh, you're that guy instead of this
[00:50:28.428 --> 00:50:29.449]  I'm just doing my job.
[00:50:29.469 --> 00:50:30.791]  No, no, great point.
[00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:34.755]  Butler went along until the very last minute and then he blew the whistle on them.
[00:50:34.995 --> 00:50:35.816]  You got a great point.
[00:50:35.836 --> 00:50:38.359]  We need sleepers as well in the info war.
[00:50:38.439 --> 00:50:39.720]  So be that sleeper.

[00:51:53.764 --> 00:51:55.704]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:56.145 --> 00:51:58.926]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:05.586 --> 00:52:09.747]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:52:10.408 --> 00:52:11.228]  You want answers?
[00:52:11.988 --> 00:52:12.908]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:17.210]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:21.851]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:23.312 --> 00:52:25.492]  Final segment with Mike Rivera.
[00:52:27.893 --> 00:52:33.635]  Yes, there is something to be said, as the last caller was saying from Iraq, the military, to
[00:52:36.363 --> 00:52:41.646]  Keeping your open, keeping quiet, and then when the shoe really drops, saying no.
[00:52:42.707 --> 00:52:44.869]  And a lot of troops have done that with these experimental vaccines.
[00:52:44.969 --> 00:52:46.990]  You know, they say it's the law, we can give you whatever we want.
[00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:48.211]  No, none of it's experimental.
[00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:57.237]  That's like, what was really telling was six years ago, Mike Rivero, when they ordered 14 million first responders, firemen, police,
[00:52:58.655 --> 00:53:01.598]  Medical workers, county, city workers would take the smallpox shot.
[00:53:02.198 --> 00:53:08.685]  And the LA Times reported two years into that that only 4,000 of 14 million had done it.
[00:53:08.705 --> 00:53:10.086]  99.9% had said no.
[00:53:11.207 --> 00:53:12.949]  And then Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take it.
[00:53:13.289 --> 00:53:19.996]  I mean, I think they can set up this grid and push it all, but as push comes to shove, this is really going to blow up in their face.
[00:53:21.809 --> 00:53:24.251]  Well, it depends on what the agenda is.
[00:53:24.271 --> 00:53:31.498]  A lot of this vaccination and pushing these medications, it's just really about justifying giving a lot more tax dollars to the pharmaceutical industries.
[00:53:31.779 --> 00:53:36.283]  I mean, we saw that with this whole swine flu brouhaha.
[00:53:36.403 --> 00:53:45.993]  I mean, obviously, given the number of people actually sick and dying from this flu, it shouldn't have been headline-grabbing news, but it did justify a lot of purchases of vaccines.
[00:53:46.613 --> 00:53:53.656]  And the other awareness, of course, is that a lot of these vaccines really are oftentimes more dangerous than the actual disease they're supposed to protect you from.
[00:53:53.696 --> 00:53:56.157]  Look back at the 1976 swine flu outbreak.
[00:53:56.497 --> 00:53:58.958]  More people died from the vaccine than from the flu itself.
[00:54:00.939 --> 00:54:02.140]  You're absolutely right about that.
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.321]  Let's take another call here from Kurt in Texas.
[00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:05.561]  Kurt, you're on the air.
[00:54:05.621 --> 00:54:06.062]  Go ahead.
[00:54:06.082 --> 00:54:09.663]  This is a subject you covered back last week.
[00:54:09.743 --> 00:54:11.124]  I couldn't get in and talk to you.
[00:54:11.944 --> 00:54:13.685]  I was at Walmart.
[00:54:14.498 --> 00:54:19.319]  And when I started to check out, there was a lady who had a child that was acting up.
[00:54:20.659 --> 00:54:30.301]  And I happened to comment to the cashier that during the time I was raised, if I threw a fit like that, my dad would take off his belt and swap me.
[00:54:31.862 --> 00:54:34.902]  And she says, oh, she became very talkative.
[00:54:34.942 --> 00:54:42.324]  She said, we're told at company meetings that if we see the parent swap the child with their
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.761]  Yeah, I wanted to back you up.
[00:54:45.222 --> 00:54:46.402]  Let me back you up.
[00:54:46.422 --> 00:54:47.903]  I see articles all over the country.
[00:54:58.874 --> 00:55:01.236]  Where a mother grabs the child and says, stop it!
[00:55:01.716 --> 00:55:05.638]  And police show up, and then it's always a footnote that surveillance cameras.
[00:55:05.679 --> 00:55:08.500]  So, the whole society is little spy tattletales.
[00:55:08.761 --> 00:55:10.722]  They're not looking for you stealing stuff half the time.
[00:55:10.742 --> 00:55:12.203]  The employees do two-thirds of the stealing.
[00:55:12.223 --> 00:55:12.983]  That's their own numbers.
[00:55:13.544 --> 00:55:15.425]  It's all about, what's that t-shirt say?
[00:55:15.985 --> 00:55:17.626]  Whoa, did they just spank that child?
[00:55:17.666 --> 00:55:18.467]  Like, stop that!
[00:55:18.507 --> 00:55:19.688]  I told you, no with that toy!
[00:55:20.646 --> 00:55:25.768]  The kids gotta get out of control so they can put them on Ritalin and Prozac so the cops can then taser them.
[00:55:25.808 --> 00:55:33.270]  So she was proud of the fact that, oh, we're told to tattle to Homeland Security, I mean Walmart.
[00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:33.670]  Yes.
[00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:35.591]  Was she proud of herself?
[00:55:36.271 --> 00:55:37.471]  Oh yes, seemed like it.
[00:55:37.531 --> 00:55:49.135]  She was very talkative about how they had told them to watch out and if they see any parents shaking or hollering at the children or swatting them with their hands
[00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:53.340]  Or something in the store to call Child Protective Services immediately.
[00:55:54.821 --> 00:55:59.663]  And I thought, goodness, my father's dead.
[00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:04.444]  If he'd been alive, he'd probably been in jail years ago.
[00:56:04.464 --> 00:56:11.267]  No, no, that's the issue is, and these sociologists and psychiatrists run everything now, they know it's going to cause everything to break down.
[00:56:11.607 --> 00:56:15.428]  It's about, I have the textbooks, they say, we're going to destroy their families.
[00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:16.369]  Mike Rivera?
[00:56:17.369 --> 00:56:18.370]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:26.515]  It's all about control and I notice as we have all these governors starting to slash the state budgets and they're talking about reducing health care for poor families.
[00:56:26.555 --> 00:56:27.956]  We just had that happen here in Hawaii.
[00:56:28.316 --> 00:56:36.642]  The one area of government that is not seeing budget cuts is the surveillance, the spying, the control, the child protective services, the elements of dictatorship.
[00:56:36.922 --> 00:56:38.303]  They're still being fully funded.
[00:56:39.847 --> 00:56:42.548]  Mike Rivero, we'll talk to you again in one month, probably sooner.
[00:56:42.628 --> 00:56:44.768]  Always appreciate your work over at WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:56:45.008 --> 00:56:46.088]  We'll see you soon, my friend.
[00:56:46.108 --> 00:56:47.208]  Thanks a lot.
[00:56:47.248 --> 00:56:47.709]  Aloha.
[00:56:48.209 --> 00:56:49.509]  Aloha to you, my friend.
[00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:51.909]  He'll be on Genesis later today, 5 o'clock.
[00:56:52.249 --> 00:56:54.510]  Okay, more of your calls straight ahead.
[00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:58.651]  And then, I'm going to break down the Cashless Society Control Grid.
[00:56:59.271 --> 00:57:00.231]  Wait until you hear this.
[00:57:00.271 --> 00:57:00.711]  Stay with us.
[00:57:00.991 --> 00:57:09.613]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[00:57:10.073 --> 00:57:14.776]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[00:57:15.236 --> 00:57:19.859]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals actually results in disease.
[00:57:20.279 --> 00:57:29.064]  Go to AmericanSuperfoods.com today and see the wide range of foods available that were designed to help your mind and body work the way they were intended to.

[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:06.990]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:58:07.291 --> 00:58:08.453]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:58:08.613 --> 00:58:12.500]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called Inner Food.
[00:58:12.864 --> 00:58:21.011]  My wife just loves the stuff, and now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[00:58:22.172 --> 00:58:24.734]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:26.535]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:58:26.776 --> 00:58:31.239]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.082]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:58:34.322 --> 00:58:40.207]  Try the NutriCafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[00:58:40.569 --> 00:58:42.750]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:45.231]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.
[00:58:45.431 --> 00:58:47.211]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:58:47.531 --> 00:58:53.013]  Go to www.enerfood.com.
[00:58:53.233 --> 00:58:57.695]  That's www.enerfood.com.

[00:59:02.093 --> 00:59:07.077]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:59:07.298 --> 00:59:11.101]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:59:11.321 --> 00:59:16.926]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:17.226 --> 00:59:17.687]  It's true.
[00:59:17.867 --> 00:59:22.091]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:22.291 --> 00:59:28.656]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:59:28.837 --> 00:59:29.277]  Number four,
[00:59:29.497 --> 00:59:32.139]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:59:32.399 --> 00:59:35.661]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:35.681 --> 00:59:39.584]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[00:59:44.887 --> 00:59:45.408]  We're good to go.
[01:00:19.514 --> 01:00:35.544]  Alright, I'm going to spend 40 minutes coming up in the next segment, the rest of the hour before Webster Tarpley joins us, going over a small slice of the casual society, cyber security, global straitjacket, full spectrum dominance grid.
[01:00:35.825 --> 01:00:37.546]  And that's what the Pentagon calls it itself.
[01:00:38.766 --> 01:00:42.609]  And last night and today, I probably wrote 15 pages of notes just of every little point.
[01:00:42.629 --> 01:00:45.411]  I printed a bunch of articles to back up what I'm saying.
[01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:50.551]  As bad as this is going to sound, this is nothing compared to what it really is.
[01:00:50.891 --> 01:00:51.291]  Nothing.
[01:00:52.751 --> 01:01:03.473]  You've heard the guy about the Walmart employees, if somebody grabs their kid by the arm and says, no, you can't have that toy, cameras are on you, they record your face, take digital photos, the police are waiting for you to take your kids.
[01:01:04.033 --> 01:01:12.135]  That's why you pull up in front of Walmart, and the lady's got four kids in the car, some of them teenagers, she walks five feet to throw money, the Salvation Army box,
[01:01:13.123 --> 01:01:17.264]  Remember, and the police were there, arrested her, CPS'd all the kids, including the two-year-old.
[01:01:17.664 --> 01:01:21.165]  Because she opened the car, locked it in the winter, ran over, threw the money in.
[01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:23.465]  They, they're watching just for you.
[01:01:23.905 --> 01:01:27.626]  White glove inspection, one thing, no due process, everything's gone.
[01:01:27.646 --> 01:01:29.246]  Your property, your kids, everything.
[01:01:29.586 --> 01:01:31.227]  This government is hyper-evil.
[01:01:31.547 --> 01:01:35.367]  They've trained everybody basically to be spies now.
[01:01:35.688 --> 01:01:37.588]  It's just hellish what they've done.
[01:01:38.379 --> 01:01:47.886]  And they, again, all the homeland security, everything is about going after patriots, conservatives, gun owners, people that say, don't tread on me, and you know, fly the Gadsden flag.
[01:01:49.568 --> 01:01:52.550]  It is so over the top, we're being hit from every angle, it's just amazing.
[01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:55.012]  I'm going to take some of your calls coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:01:56.413 --> 01:02:00.817]  Before we do that though, because I get so many calls and questions about it, and he hadn't been on with us in over a month.
[01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:07.999]  I wanted to get a Cola Blue's Tyler Palmer on, the designer and head of the company, co-CEO over there.
[01:02:08.619 --> 01:02:12.684]  I wanted to get him on because, well, they just mailed one to Jesse Ventura.
[01:02:12.764 --> 01:02:16.128]  He saw one at Willie Nelson's house and really wanted one when he was here.
[01:02:16.148 --> 01:02:17.489]  And he said, hey, I want one of those.
[01:02:17.529 --> 01:02:18.210]  How do I buy one?
[01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:20.773]  And I just said, look, we'll just send you one from a Cola Blue.
[01:02:20.813 --> 01:02:22.254]  And he just got his yesterday.
[01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:26.318]  It grabs water out of the atmosphere.
[01:02:26.598 --> 01:02:28.219]  That's what clouds are, for those that don't know.
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:31.261]  They are water vapor, and it's humidity.
[01:02:31.301 --> 01:02:34.583]  You know, like when you hear, humidity today is 65%, or it's a muggy 80% humidity.
[01:02:36.181 --> 01:02:40.762]  In average humidity, you get seven and a half gallons a day, and that's with their smaller units.
[01:02:40.782 --> 01:02:41.803]  They have bigger ones if you want them.
[01:02:42.103 --> 01:02:43.783]  Computerized, but very simple.
[01:02:43.903 --> 01:02:48.585]  Hot, cold water, how much water, what the humidity is, seven filters it goes through.
[01:02:48.645 --> 01:02:52.266]  I wanted to have him on for a few minutes to talk about the system.
[01:02:52.726 --> 01:02:54.187]  You don't have to have a well, water, anything.
[01:02:54.227 --> 01:03:00.889]  They have solar panels you can get, you know, to just run the unit, even if you don't want to be on the grid and running off the power system.
[01:03:01.249 --> 01:03:04.790]  This is the thing to have in the city, in the country, you name it.
[01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:10.334]  And the military and governments buy the big humidifiers and even some of the small ones from a cola blue.
[01:03:10.594 --> 01:03:12.315]  So it's good to have Tyler Palmer on with us.
[01:03:12.335 --> 01:03:13.757]  Tyler, thanks for joining us.
[01:03:14.017 --> 01:03:16.819]  Thank you for having me again, Alex, and hello to all the listeners.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:27.507]  I was listening to the show earlier and I thought, you know, how long can we last without water once this controlled grid gets implemented?
[01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:32.491]  And it's the time now to get ready and get ready
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:44.662]  With water, with energy, with food, it's a very crucial and critical time to get the message out, and I'm glad that your show is a vehicle for doing that.
[01:03:46.403 --> 01:03:57.145]  Well, I'm just sitting here thinking of the control grid and things I haven't written down on these pages coming up, and I thought, oh, kill switches being built into all the cars, microphones and cameras on all the computers.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.001]  There's no way to keep track of all of this.
[01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:02.321]  I mean, it's just getting too insane.
[01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:04.822]  Tell folks about the Ecola Blue and how folks get it.
[01:04:05.122 --> 01:04:06.582]  I know you're offering a discount today.
[01:04:07.123 --> 01:04:17.206]  Yeah, well, the Ecola Blue, as you said, it takes the humidity in the air and it condenses that humidity and makes drinking water out of the humidity in your air.
[01:04:17.226 --> 01:04:21.288]  It doesn't just grab the humidity and serve it up.
[01:04:21.408 --> 01:04:25.269]  It filters it through, essentially,
[01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:46.399]  Seven filters, one reverse osmosis system, three activated carbon filters, and then one granular media that has like diatomaceous earth in it, which is sort of a way of straining out, you know, smaller
[01:04:48.796 --> 01:04:53.017]  Organisms and whatever might be in the atmosphere.
[01:04:53.277 --> 01:04:56.138]  So there's a filter made out of plankton skeletons.
[01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:57.778]  One of the best filters in the world.
[01:04:58.179 --> 01:04:59.199]  Right.
[01:04:59.379 --> 01:05:02.620]  And also we use the ultraviolet light.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.681]  It has a 245 nanometer UV light in the upper storage tank.
[01:05:08.201 --> 01:05:12.062]  And we've recently added one to the lower storage tank as well.
[01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:14.523]  So there's two UV lights in there now.
[01:05:15.987 --> 01:05:21.050]  Some people say it's overkill, but when you taste the water, it certainly speaks for itself.
[01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:30.395]  And we just got a big shipment of them in, and if you want to order them for Father's Day or for just getting prepared,
[01:05:31.132 --> 01:05:32.873]  We do have a special today.
[01:05:32.953 --> 01:05:34.114]  Father's Day!
[01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:37.075]  Ooh, sounds like... Ooh, Al-Qaeda, better call it.
[01:05:37.095 --> 01:05:40.057]  Ooh, Fathers, Patriots, Founding Fathers.
[01:05:40.097 --> 01:05:42.938]  This is... Don't give anybody a Don't Try It On Me shirt for Father's Day.
[01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:44.079]  Don't give them a Nicola Blue.
[01:05:44.979 --> 01:05:45.360]  Absolutely.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.300]  Tell the folks about the special.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.341]  I'm sorry I interrupted.
[01:05:47.441 --> 01:05:49.382]  That's okay.
[01:05:49.402 --> 01:05:50.842]  10% off plus free shipping.
[01:05:51.002 --> 01:05:53.644]  So, the shipping is $100 value and 10% off $13.50.
[01:05:53.684 --> 01:05:53.984]  So that's $1,215.
[01:06:00.154 --> 01:06:01.515]  You can get that by calling 800-691-6043.
[01:06:01.635 --> 01:06:02.215]  Again, 800-691-6043.
[01:06:02.756 --> 01:06:04.637]  That's 1-800-691-6043 or acolablue.com.
[01:06:04.657 --> 01:06:06.558]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[01:06:06.578 --> 01:06:07.118]  That's right.
[01:06:07.218 --> 01:06:12.582]  And promo code Alex Jones and we'll have this promo available until Friday, June 5th.
[01:06:12.662 --> 01:06:14.963]  So we hope people will call up and
[01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:38.955]  And get one for themselves or for their friends or family and let's get prepared because you can only last about three days without water.
[01:06:40.256 --> 01:06:49.502]  Well, I mean, plus, this is, even if you've got well water, a lot of wells are contaminated, some of them are great, but this is out of the atmosphere and then it goes through filters.
[01:06:49.542 --> 01:06:53.144]  You can't get clearer, you can't get purer, you can't get better tasting.
[01:06:53.204 --> 01:06:57.387]  This is just an amazing system and anybody that's used it gets completely addicted.
[01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:04.768]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, acolablue.com, or that phone number, one more time for folks, we'll put it up on screen.
[01:07:05.149 --> 01:07:14.791]  People at prisonplanet.tv, it's 1-800-691-6043, 1-800-691-6043, or ecoloblue.com.
[01:07:15.151 --> 01:07:18.711]  Big links up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:24.533]  Not only is it one of the best deals out there on a high-quality atmospheric water generator, you're getting about, what it sounds like, about 20% off today.
[01:07:26.133 --> 01:07:27.674]  And they also are patriots.
[01:07:28.034 --> 01:07:30.956]  Turns out Tyler's been a listener for many, many years.
[01:07:31.196 --> 01:07:33.077]  Thank you so much, sir, for coming on the show with us.
[01:07:33.097 --> 01:07:33.537]  Thank you.
[01:07:33.737 --> 01:07:35.038]  And thank you to the listeners.
[01:07:35.118 --> 01:07:36.959]  And everybody, get prepared.
[01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:39.040]  And I'll speak to you soon, Alex.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:39.640]  You bet.
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:40.101]  Take care.
[01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:40.581]  Thank you.
[01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:40.861]  All right.
[01:07:40.901 --> 01:07:43.702]  There goes our guest, Tyler Palmer, at ColaBlue.com.
[01:07:44.883 --> 01:07:52.047]  Let's take a few phone calls now, and then I'm preparing to get into the Cashless Society control grid.
[01:07:53.766 --> 01:07:55.887]  Hey Alex, my answer to that last caller is don't go to Walmart.
[01:07:55.907 --> 01:07:59.209]  I haven't been to Walmart in three years.
[01:08:16.465 --> 01:08:17.846]  But that's not what I called for.
[01:08:18.046 --> 01:08:24.288]  Look, I tried to go to IGA in Port Aransas when there were probably 20 people in there at 9.30 before it closed on a Friday night.
[01:08:24.308 --> 01:08:26.069]  I already told the story.
[01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:29.431]  And I mean, the guy literally came up and looked at my shirt at the security guard.
[01:08:30.271 --> 01:08:30.631]  Correct.
[01:08:31.231 --> 01:08:34.033]  I wore my 9-11 t-shirt all the time and get funny looks.
[01:08:34.433 --> 01:08:37.074]  I mean, they're trained to literally spy on us.
[01:08:37.394 --> 01:08:38.995]  I mean, this is not freedom, folks.
[01:08:39.775 --> 01:08:40.215]  No it's not.
[01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:45.720]  I'm a disabled Marine from the Vietnam conflict and also an ex-police officer.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.541]  I've talked to you before.
[01:08:46.601 --> 01:08:47.622]  I used to live in Austin.
[01:08:49.583 --> 01:08:50.504]  I was waterboarded.
[01:08:50.604 --> 01:08:52.986]  I went to survival school.
[01:08:53.006 --> 01:09:00.692]  I was not only waterboarded, I was put in a box that was smaller than I was tall and beat on and taken out and put on a stool.
[01:09:03.335 --> 01:09:07.138]  My hands had my back and the stool was kicked out from under me.
[01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:10.670]  And don't do the water boring.
[01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:14.851]  I've had problems from that since 1971.
[01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:18.672]  I'm claustrophobic.
[01:09:19.812 --> 01:09:21.333]  I had always been an avid swimmer.
[01:09:21.953 --> 01:09:28.215]  Every time I get water up my nose, I have just a slight panic from that.
[01:09:28.235 --> 01:09:30.255]  And I'll advise you, don't do it.
[01:09:30.556 --> 01:09:31.336]  Take my word for it.
[01:09:31.416 --> 01:09:31.876]  It's torture.
[01:09:32.947 --> 01:09:40.853]  Well, I know it's torture, but I want to illustrate what it's like when somebody really... I want to see... I'm guessing I can hold out about 30-45 seconds.
[01:09:40.873 --> 01:09:41.754]  We'll see if I can do it.
[01:09:42.575 --> 01:09:46.298]  And, uh... I can just turn my brain off, usually.
[01:09:46.358 --> 01:09:48.519]  I want to see how bad it really is.
[01:09:48.779 --> 01:09:50.561]  But I know it can cause physical damage.
[01:09:50.881 --> 01:09:55.044]  That's why the Chicago Police were trying to stop Eric Moller, man-cow, from doing it.
[01:09:55.345 --> 01:09:57.006]  You're saying it caused you health problems?
[01:09:57.767 --> 01:10:00.309]  Yes, it's caused... I'm mostly in the mental.
[01:10:00.909 --> 01:10:02.110]  I have PTSD, anyway.
[01:10:02.785 --> 01:10:10.908]  And, uh, but the waterboarding really bothered me more, the waterboarding and the rest of it, bothered me more than going to war.
[01:10:12.368 --> 01:10:22.511]  You know, I have more effects from the, from the, the survival school, but you gotta realize, 1971 Marine Corps bootcamp, uh, at least every three days you speak.
[01:10:22.991 --> 01:10:25.312]  Uh, they don't do that anymore, but they did when I went through.
[01:10:27.106 --> 01:10:37.270]  I've talked to older Marines, they say they used to shoot at you, throw real hand grenades, beat people, people would die falling off ropes, and I guess they've lightened it up a bit.
[01:10:38.011 --> 01:10:50.317]  They were experts at hitting you in the solar plexus, taking the end of your bayonet while I was on your hip and jabbing it in your side, or just plain kicking you in the butt, hard with the toe of the shoe, toe of the boot.
[01:10:51.824 --> 01:10:55.266]  And like I said, I was 18 years old when I went to that survival school.
[01:10:55.326 --> 01:10:57.366]  I was in top physical condition.
[01:10:57.927 --> 01:10:59.808]  Best physical condition I was ever in in my life.
[01:11:00.508 --> 01:11:01.468]  And it almost killed me.
[01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:05.510]  Well Ventura said that they jump on your stomach too when they waterboard you.
[01:11:05.530 --> 01:11:06.310]  Do they do that to you?
[01:11:06.951 --> 01:11:07.211]  Yes.
[01:11:07.811 --> 01:11:08.031]  Yes.
[01:11:08.671 --> 01:11:10.092]  And you think you're dead.
[01:11:10.392 --> 01:11:10.992]  You think you're dead.
[01:11:11.032 --> 01:11:12.253]  I was also choked out.
[01:11:13.273 --> 01:11:14.954]  We did that in boot camp.
[01:11:15.594 --> 01:11:17.415]  You had your buddy behind you.
[01:11:17.655 --> 01:11:21.117]  You could not fight back and they actually choked you out until you passed out.
[01:11:22.624 --> 01:11:24.885]  Yeah, in high school a few times we did that as a game.
[01:11:25.185 --> 01:11:35.833]  The weird dreams you have, like in the 10 seconds you pass out, and all the guys in there have been, like, and I have had these weird dreams, I go, the only problem is one time they let me go and I hit my head and busted it open.
[01:11:36.493 --> 01:11:38.034]  I tell you, the crazy stuff that goes on.
[01:11:38.214 --> 01:11:40.116]  Well, I'd like to hear more of those stories sometime.
[01:11:40.136 --> 01:11:41.777]  I've got this big breakdown coming up.
[01:11:42.317 --> 01:11:43.778]  But, Roger, we appreciate your call.
[01:11:43.798 --> 01:11:44.279]  God bless you.
[01:11:45.953 --> 01:11:46.413]  Take care.
[01:11:46.934 --> 01:11:50.756]  All right, we're going to come back and talk to Todd, Rick, Julio, Chris and others.
[01:11:51.056 --> 01:11:51.657]  Look, it's too late.
[01:11:51.677 --> 01:11:53.058]  I've already said I'm going to get waterboarded.
[01:11:53.078 --> 01:11:53.678]  It's going to happen.
[01:11:53.698 --> 01:11:56.800]  We've just got to figure out when and how and when.
[01:11:57.241 --> 01:11:58.461]  So that's all coming up as well.
[01:11:59.102 --> 01:12:00.603]  Put it live on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:12:01.123 --> 01:12:03.325]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:12.551]  We have received news the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[01:12:12.971 --> 01:12:20.820]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:26.927]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[01:12:27.748 --> 01:12:29.169]  506-5904.
[01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:35.054]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:40.078]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[01:12:40.318 --> 01:12:49.005]  American Tax Settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back, and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[01:12:49.385 --> 01:12:53.448]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800
[01:12:55.510 --> 01:13:06.876]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:07.397 --> 01:13:14.421]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:13:14.961 --> 01:13:21.146]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:13:21.566 --> 01:13:23.388]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:13:23.528 --> 01:13:25.950]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:36.979]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:13:37.599 --> 01:13:38.900]  It's not about left or right.
[01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:40.642]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:13:41.138 --> 01:13:47.482]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:13:48.042 --> 01:13:55.806]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:56.306 --> 01:13:57.447]  The Obama Deception.
[01:13:57.867 --> 01:13:59.068]  The people strike back.
[01:14:02.316 --> 01:14:03.177]  Spring is here.
[01:14:03.437 --> 01:14:04.217]  Growing season.
[01:14:04.397 --> 01:14:06.378]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:14:06.598 --> 01:14:07.999]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:14:08.299 --> 01:14:08.980]  Think about it.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.142]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:14:13.362 --> 01:14:16.844]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:14:17.064 --> 01:14:19.625]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:14:19.886 --> 01:14:31.752]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:14:31.992 --> 01:14:32.432]  I think so.
[01:15:00.638 --> 01:15:06.863]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:15:07.323 --> 01:15:15.089]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:15:15.429 --> 01:15:23.315]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:15:23.615 --> 01:15:28.359]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:15:28.679 --> 01:15:33.402]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:15:33.903 --> 01:15:37.766]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:15:38.246 --> 01:15:39.267]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:15:39.347 --> 01:15:43.430]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:44.770]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:15:48.746 --> 01:15:51.307]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:53.488]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:15:53.508 --> 01:15:53.748]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:15:53.768 --> 01:15:54.769]  He's pounding down, loaded up and trucking.
[01:15:54.789 --> 01:15:56.930]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[01:16:24.361 --> 01:16:33.608]  Okay, for the next 40 minutes, I'm going to break down the cash flow society has been over at.
[01:16:34.008 --> 01:16:34.108]  Then,
[01:16:51.738 --> 01:16:55.341]  Webster Griffin Tarpley is going to join us and continue with Open Phones as well.
[01:16:58.164 --> 01:17:08.113]  Now understand, as bad as this is going to sound, this is not one one hundredth of the knowledge that I'm aware of, and I'm probably not aware of half of what's going on.
[01:17:10.315 --> 01:17:12.917]  The more I learn, the less I know that I know.
[01:17:13.438 --> 01:17:18.222]  It just always gets worse, always gets crazier than we had first broken down.
[01:17:20.836 --> 01:17:35.927]  Now remember, I had gotten on the air 13 years ago with the Telecommunications Act of 96 and said they're turning all the major telecommunications and cyber systems that are private with $9 billion of federal money into giant wiretaps.
[01:17:35.988 --> 01:17:39.470]  It was admitted it was designed for the feds to cull through it without wiretaps.
[01:17:39.490 --> 01:17:41.071]  That was debated in Congress.
[01:17:41.792 --> 01:17:47.056]  And then I would have listeners call in and say there's no such thing as the NSA, there's no such thing as Echelon.
[01:17:47.336 --> 01:17:49.578]  Remember in the mid-90s it didn't exist?
[01:17:53.957 --> 01:17:57.179]  So, let's throw that Mother Jones article up first.
[01:17:57.899 --> 01:17:59.440]  Should Obama Control the Internet?
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:06.244]  And if you scroll down on the article, they have the quotes by Jay Rockefeller and Senator Olympia Snowe as well.
[01:18:07.847 --> 01:18:13.269]  Saying, should President Obama have the power to shut down the domestic internet traffic during a state of emergency?
[01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:19.311]  Senators John Rockefeller, that goes by Jay, and Olympia Snowe, Senators, think so.
[01:18:20.051 --> 01:18:25.072]  And that's the bill that Obama has executive, signed in as an executive order.
[01:18:25.352 --> 01:18:26.753]  This is the accompanying bill.
[01:18:28.086 --> 01:18:31.627]  Now, that's just to head off one small part of this larger story.
[01:18:31.987 --> 01:18:33.407]  People are in denial.
[01:18:33.487 --> 01:18:42.309]  This story posted at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, a detailed analysis by Paul Watson that gives you a wide spectrum view of what's happening.
[01:18:42.789 --> 01:18:46.670]  People are all over both websites commenting, saying, we're making it up.
[01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:48.770]  There's no way to shut down the Internet.
[01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:54.251]  Well, the stated goal of the Pentagon and the Cyber Command is to do just that.
[01:18:54.811 --> 01:18:57.572]  And the head of cyber security
[01:18:59.065 --> 01:19:10.087]  Quit in March, Cyber Security Chief resigns amid turf battle in a blunt letter Rod Bergstrom cited clash with National Security Agency.
[01:19:10.107 --> 01:19:11.568]  So they act like it's a turf battle.
[01:19:11.788 --> 01:19:19.450]  When you actually read what he had to say, he says, a threat to our democracy with the Pentagon taking over all private Internet activity in the United States.
[01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:25.311]  And in a blunt letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Bergstrom
[01:19:26.618 --> 01:19:33.202]  Complained about a shortage of money for the center and clash over whether the National Security Agency should control cyber efforts.
[01:19:33.542 --> 01:19:39.665]  The role of the NSA in protecting domestic computer networks has triggered debate, particularly among privacy and civil libertarians groups.
[01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:42.206]  So this is kind of an MSNBC whitewash.
[01:19:42.507 --> 01:19:44.608]  You pull up the other articles, you can actually read him saying.
[01:19:45.048 --> 01:19:46.229]  In fact, I want that on screen.
[01:19:46.889 --> 01:19:47.849]  I meant to have that article.
[01:19:47.889 --> 01:19:52.752]  Just Google, head of cyber security, resigned, says threat to democracy.
[01:19:52.812 --> 01:19:53.873]  I want folks to see that.
[01:19:54.593 --> 01:19:55.674]  In case there's any denial out there.
[01:19:56.471 --> 01:20:07.006]  So, that said, let me just read over the four pages of notes that I've boiled this down to of different control grid points.
[01:20:08.206 --> 01:20:23.158]  The Cashless Society surveillance grid to control mobility and purchasing and to track and trace all you buy, sell and do, track all your internet activity, track all your private activity, track your car everywhere you drive by scanning and reading your license plate.
[01:20:23.399 --> 01:20:26.961]  That's now nationwide in the U.S., all over Europe, all over England.
[01:20:26.981 --> 01:20:28.603]  It's a global treaty.
[01:20:28.943 --> 01:20:31.765]  It's all integrated in global databases under treaties.
[01:20:32.606 --> 01:20:33.307]  I want to go over that.
[01:20:33.347 --> 01:20:33.768]  Yeah, U.S.
[01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:37.552]  Cybersecurity Chief quits over NSA power grab, the register.
[01:20:37.973 --> 01:20:38.153]  U.S.
[01:20:38.173 --> 01:20:46.484]  Government Cybersecurity Chief abruptly quit last week amid allegations his office was woefully underfunded and
[01:20:49.741 --> 01:20:53.543]  And unduly controlled by the country's ultra-secretive National Security Agency.
[01:20:53.983 --> 01:20:57.384]  And he goes on to say that it is a threat to our freedoms.
[01:20:57.885 --> 01:21:01.226]  So yeah, that's got his actual quotes from his letter right there out of the register.
[01:21:01.246 --> 01:21:03.867]  I was trying to read it across the room and couldn't.
[01:21:03.887 --> 01:21:04.948]  I had to look over here.
[01:21:08.469 --> 01:21:13.692]  So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to go over, this was a quick segment, a long segment coming up, I'm going to break down
[01:21:14.738 --> 01:21:20.643]  These different points and tie it all together and MIT, the Pentagon, the UN, it's all stated.
[01:21:21.443 --> 01:21:25.186]  Internet2, which is a consortium, everything you're going to hear here is on record.
[01:21:25.546 --> 01:21:26.787]  This is what they admit.
[01:21:28.308 --> 01:21:32.131]  Can you imagine what we don't know?
[01:21:34.153 --> 01:21:36.675]  Can you imagine what we're not being told?
[01:21:38.596 --> 01:21:41.298]  So we will go over all of it.
[01:21:42.403 --> 01:21:46.048]  On the other side of this quick break right here on the GCN Radio Network, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:21:51.654 --> 01:21:52.556]  We're on the march.
[01:21:53.056 --> 01:21:54.658]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:55.579 --> 01:21:58.303]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:01.035 --> 01:22:02.597]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:22:02.717 --> 01:22:07.384]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:10.228]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:22:10.428 --> 01:22:13.292]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:22:13.472 --> 01:22:18.199]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:22:18.379 --> 01:22:18.639]  We're good.

[01:24:01.969 --> 01:24:10.636]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:24:11.076 --> 01:24:15.780]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:24:16.241 --> 01:24:20.864]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals actually results in disease.
[01:24:21.285 --> 01:24:23.947]  Go to AmericanSuperfoods.com today!
[01:24:24.307 --> 01:24:24.547]  I'm good.
[01:24:38.496 --> 01:24:39.477]  We're good to go.
[01:25:07.389 --> 01:25:12.551]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[01:25:12.991 --> 01:25:18.034]  I've never been with anything less than a nine, so fine.
[01:25:18.474 --> 01:25:22.976]  I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
[01:25:23.746 --> 01:25:30.330]  Ah, there's two key points I want to make and then I'm going to launch into the details.
[01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:30.891]  And that's this.
[01:25:41.675 --> 01:25:46.181]  Through international treaties in 2000 is one they had in Australia.
[01:25:46.521 --> 01:25:56.113]  We already have a world ID agreed upon standardization of the type of digital photo, the type of biometrics, the type of fingerprints biometrically.
[01:25:56.954 --> 01:25:59.357]  Through the treaty, we already have a world ID system.
[01:25:59.377 --> 01:26:14.332]  That's why Germany and England and Japan, when the United States makes people entering it biometrically scanned, the very same companies, the very same systems are contracted to put in those grids in other parts of the world.
[01:26:14.572 --> 01:26:17.175]  So, this is internationally standardized.
[01:26:18.952 --> 01:26:27.678]  And all the things you see that individually are horrible tyranny are all openly set up by think tanks, openly rolled out and taught in the universities.
[01:26:28.598 --> 01:26:33.762]  Most of the big grants and the people that are getting their tuition paid for with scholarships now.
[01:26:34.082 --> 01:26:45.009]  The biggest growth industry isn't just law enforcement, but it's homeland security, data mining, and total information awareness network, and Patriot Act compliance.
[01:26:45.329 --> 01:26:47.331]  So this is all in the industry publications.
[01:26:48.109 --> 01:26:49.110]  It's a big joke to them.
[01:26:49.650 --> 01:27:02.898]  Everything you buy, everything you sell, everything you do, everything you believe, everywhere you surf, everything you do, as the New York Times bragged years ago, dealing with the Total Information Awareness Network, is now being integrated and tracked.
[01:27:03.299 --> 01:27:05.800]  So you can forget trying to hide out and not be in their system.
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:08.282]  The answer is bring the criminals to justice.
[01:27:08.662 --> 01:27:12.104]  Bring the bankers that are destroying the dollar and our sovereignty to justice.
[01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:13.045]  I'm going to cover that next hour.
[01:27:14.417 --> 01:27:20.941]  Now, thinking about this show for the last week, the reason I keep holding off doing it is because there is so much data.
[01:27:20.961 --> 01:27:21.842]  So I just want to make that point.
[01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:22.983]  This is full of notes on it.
[01:27:23.383 --> 01:27:26.625]  These are just notes off those notes that I wrote today, trying to boil it down.
[01:27:26.925 --> 01:27:27.926]  Let me just go over these.
[01:27:29.947 --> 01:27:39.153]  This is an opting into the matrix is what's happening right now, where Google announces, oh, we have a new system we're using now for four years, where the cameras and
[01:27:40.225 --> 01:27:42.826]  Microphones built into all the new computers.
[01:27:43.046 --> 01:27:48.608]  We have a AI software listening to every word you say, what you do, watching you.
[01:27:48.948 --> 01:27:57.091]  If your dog's barking, then Google ads for dogs and dog food and dog toys and dog medicine and heartworm medicine pops up on screen.
[01:27:57.111 --> 01:27:58.211]  That was the example they used.
[01:27:58.531 --> 01:28:08.415]  Or if we hear you watching a particular show or see it off the computer camera, we will then advertise products that go along with that psychological algorithm, that personality type.
[01:28:08.675 --> 01:28:09.575]  This is announced!
[01:28:11.673 --> 01:28:12.654]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[01:28:12.694 --> 01:28:13.475]  Punch it up on screen.
[01:28:14.355 --> 01:28:20.200]  Google using cameras and microphones to track computer users.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.702]  I think that was the Prison Planet headline.
[01:28:22.062 --> 01:28:24.184]  And then we've got links to Google's press release.
[01:28:26.294 --> 01:28:27.734]  I mean, they're bragging about this.
[01:28:28.475 --> 01:28:29.795]  And other companies are doing it.
[01:28:29.895 --> 01:28:42.699]  TiVo, remember the Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction with her breasts coming out in the Super Bowl, that staged event, as staged as the barat guy, you know, falling on Eminem at the MTV Awards.
[01:28:42.739 --> 01:28:43.580]  I told you that was staged.
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:44.380]  Now they admit it's staged.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:44.860]  I mean, come on.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:45.720]  It's all staged, folks.
[01:28:46.161 --> 01:28:47.021]  Quit being so gullible.
[01:28:49.025 --> 01:28:53.167]  Tivo came out and said, oh, we had 2.2 million rewinds and replays.
[01:28:53.407 --> 01:28:57.748]  And the Chicago Tribune said, but I'd always been saying, you mean that's a two-way system?
[01:28:57.768 --> 01:28:58.729]  You're tracking what they do?
[01:28:58.769 --> 01:29:00.289]  And they said, yeah.
[01:29:00.850 --> 01:29:02.951]  See, there's thousands of these examples.
[01:29:02.991 --> 01:29:04.651]  So you're opting into the matrix.
[01:29:07.972 --> 01:29:11.253]  article here today that's on the front page of Xbox.com.
[01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:15.034]  Just go to Xbox.com and it's Steven Spielberg running it.
[01:29:16.094 --> 01:29:20.455]  And I know somebody that worked high level for Microsoft in development of the Xbox.
[01:29:20.815 --> 01:29:25.256]  It's meant to take over your computer, your cell phone, your whole life, your identity, your friends.
[01:29:25.736 --> 01:29:29.317]  The outside world will be so bad you'll want to be in the simulated world.
[01:29:30.037 --> 01:29:45.885]  This, you scan with a camera on it, your body, your biometrics, you turn forward, sideways, and backwards, your 360 body is now scanned, two-way, the feds are in it, this is, Microsoft is the feds, just like IBM, on record, in-game covers it, it's now declassified.
[01:29:46.653 --> 01:29:48.534]  We covered it two years ago, it's now mainstream news.
[01:29:49.374 --> 01:30:00.757]  But I know people high-level, two different people, but one super high-level in the involvement with the development of all this, and this is literally meant to mesmerize, to lower your brainwaves, to put you into a trance.
[01:30:01.098 --> 01:30:04.058]  Television already does it, but this is to bring you to the next level.
[01:30:04.519 --> 01:30:05.219]  This is the
[01:30:06.483 --> 01:30:07.724]  Opting into the matrix.
[01:30:08.324 --> 01:30:10.345]  Notice the kids when you see them at restaurants.
[01:30:10.365 --> 01:30:11.405]  They're not talking to their parents.
[01:30:11.425 --> 01:30:12.005]  They're texting.
[01:30:12.465 --> 01:30:14.066]  They watch four or five hours of TV a day.
[01:30:14.086 --> 01:30:15.347]  Two or three hours of video games.
[01:30:15.627 --> 01:30:17.407]  They won't talk to their friends across the table.
[01:30:17.627 --> 01:30:18.548]  They're texting to them.
[01:30:19.228 --> 01:30:21.169]  They're not having language anymore.
[01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:22.549]  That's a major British study.
[01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:23.910]  About all this media.
[01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:25.130]  People don't have language anymore.
[01:30:25.330 --> 01:30:28.952]  The language is being reduced down where you can't talk to people.
[01:30:31.505 --> 01:30:33.086]  So we're being sucked into the matrix.
[01:30:33.107 --> 01:30:40.513]  The TV screen is a lens on which projects through the eyes, which are brain stems, literally windows into the soul interfacing.
[01:30:41.214 --> 01:30:44.477]  And so we're being mesmerized, being sucked into the crystal ball.
[01:30:44.957 --> 01:30:45.878]  That's how they liken it.
[01:30:46.258 --> 01:30:49.822]  So people are opting into the matrix, being sucked in.
[01:30:50.933 --> 01:31:05.155]  Thirty, forty years ago, writers talked about how you'd live in Manhattan, or Houston, or wherever, and you'd see high-rise buildings with people fighting, and people playing pool, and people gambling, or people having sex, or people reading, or people laughing.
[01:31:06.934 --> 01:31:11.679]  Now you look at high-rise buildings and it's nothing but blue glow at night.
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:12.600]  No one's talking.
[01:31:12.641 --> 01:31:13.321]  No one's living.
[01:31:13.662 --> 01:31:14.883]  The TV is the life.
[01:31:15.003 --> 01:31:15.464]  It's everything.
[01:31:15.504 --> 01:31:17.166]  It's teaching you how to tattle on your neighbors.
[01:31:17.566 --> 01:31:19.208]  It's teaching you that you're fat and inadequate.
[01:31:19.468 --> 01:31:21.510]  It's teaching you that cops tasering you are good.
[01:31:21.751 --> 01:31:22.772]  And the Second Amendment's bad.
[01:31:22.812 --> 01:31:23.833]  It's all messages.
[01:31:24.013 --> 01:31:24.774]  All brainwashing.
[01:31:24.974 --> 01:31:25.935]  That torture is good.
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.300]  That vaccines are good.
[01:31:28.921 --> 01:31:35.303]  You're opting in and it's made to be comfortable and funny and goofy and your choices and your favorites.
[01:31:35.923 --> 01:31:37.283]  This is the control system.
[01:31:39.164 --> 01:31:42.545]  Let me see, I've covered point one of all these pages.
[01:31:43.605 --> 01:31:44.426]  Will we ever get to it?
[01:31:48.867 --> 01:31:51.588]  So you're opting into the matrix, but are you really opting in?
[01:31:52.503 --> 01:32:00.009]  It's kind of like you opt in to go down to the river's edge to drink some water as a primitive man and a big crocodile grabs you and drags you in and eats you.
[01:32:00.369 --> 01:32:02.491]  You opted in to go get water that looked good.
[01:32:02.751 --> 01:32:04.392]  You didn't see those two eyes right there.
[01:32:04.653 --> 01:32:06.614]  I'm telling you, there's crocodiles down there.
[01:32:06.994 --> 01:32:11.318]  I'm telling you out here in the hill country, if you buy a house in the country, watch out for rattlesnakes.
[01:32:11.378 --> 01:32:13.079]  The realtors won't tell you about it.
[01:32:13.439 --> 01:32:14.060]  That's what I do.
[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:17.683]  I warn my fellow humans because I have a tribal love of humanity.
[01:32:18.612 --> 01:32:25.515]  But see, the marketers, they love the fact that they're lying there in the water's edge with just their eyes and the tip of their nose popped up.
[01:32:26.896 --> 01:32:28.416]  So you think you're going into something fun.
[01:32:28.456 --> 01:32:31.898]  This is a scientific pentagon assault on you and your family.
[01:32:34.079 --> 01:32:39.281]  So the control grid is a technological enslavement
[01:32:40.247 --> 01:32:40.887]  It's a paradigm.
[01:32:41.448 --> 01:32:46.351]  And it's all standardized, all controlled, always being honed, being implemented in phases.
[01:32:46.391 --> 01:32:50.915]  This is all stated by Internet2 and RAND Corporation documents and MIT.
[01:32:50.935 --> 01:32:52.816]  They're all on record bragging about it.
[01:32:54.017 --> 01:32:55.098]  They're on power trips.
[01:32:55.118 --> 01:33:07.507]  There's these arrogant technocrats and there's psychologists, psychiatrists, controllers above them and then the elites who make the decisions who are very proud of how dumb the public is and how they've dumbed the public down further and how they use every human instinct.
[01:33:08.257 --> 01:33:12.298]  To manipulate us and every human instinct against us to control us.
[01:33:15.378 --> 01:33:24.920]  Now the end game of this is to have the false culture of the television and the different niche groups they're targeting integrate and then manifest on the ground.
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:32.522]  To have the delusions, the disinformation and the paranoia and the lies manifest in the real three-dimensional world
[01:33:33.522 --> 01:33:34.863]  Not the two-dimensional television.
[01:33:35.503 --> 01:33:47.291]  That's why they're coming ahead with every major production firm, Industrial Light & Magic, DreamWorks, the group headed up by James Cameron, to go to holograms.
[01:33:47.311 --> 01:33:52.614]  And now they're introducing holograms on CNN to make the unreality even more real.
[01:33:53.615 --> 01:33:55.576]  So they want to highly control mobility.
[01:33:57.386 --> 01:34:00.289]  Mobility by having you watch TV instead of go play basketball.
[01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:06.134]  Mobility instead of having you spend time reading history books to your children so you'll watch your show, they watch their show.
[01:34:06.986 --> 01:34:14.392]  Mobility, where you've got to have all the trinkets and crap so you're in debt to buy all the little trinkets they sell, and all the gadgetry which controls you further.
[01:34:14.673 --> 01:34:20.638]  By federal law, all the cell phones track you down to a few feet with GPS triangulators off the cell towers.
[01:34:21.138 --> 01:34:25.602]  By law, they can listen to you even without a warrant, and even when the phone is turned off.
[01:34:25.662 --> 01:34:27.824]  I told you that 12 years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[01:34:28.144 --> 01:34:30.246]  I just point out, don't be in denial anymore.
[01:34:30.646 --> 01:34:31.827]  Remember all the things I talked about?
[01:34:32.228 --> 01:34:35.971]  We've got to just get all the hundreds of old shows, video shows, TV shows, I didn't put them on the web.
[01:34:36.272 --> 01:34:40.976]  Some folks are doing that, but if you've got my shows, you've watched me in Austin for years, just put them on the web, folks.
[01:34:42.778 --> 01:34:50.546]  Because slaves today have been incrementally taught to believe this and go along with it, but if they can see somebody telling them exactly what would happen 10, 12, 13, 14 years before, that has an effect on them.
[01:34:54.747 --> 01:34:58.592]  They sell you the image that guns are illegal through television.
[01:34:58.732 --> 01:35:03.218]  This is just one example of hundreds where everything is based in Chicago, LA, or New York.
[01:35:03.278 --> 01:35:05.121]  They have highly restricted gun laws.
[01:35:05.781 --> 01:35:09.807]  So these dramas and cop shows are based there where people go to jail for having a gun.
[01:35:10.508 --> 01:35:12.690]  On these cop shows, the carpet cleaner sees a gun.
[01:35:14.082 --> 01:35:15.783]  In the New York apartment, he calls the cops.
[01:35:16.063 --> 01:35:17.684]  Turns out the guy's a child molester.
[01:35:17.724 --> 01:35:19.105]  He deserves to have his gun taken.
[01:35:19.385 --> 01:35:21.566]  If you're a gun owner, you're a child molester, is the message.
[01:35:22.066 --> 01:35:25.528]  And people are always right to call the cops on people and are heroes.
[01:35:25.868 --> 01:35:34.513]  And so somebody in Austin, Texas watches that show, NYPD, Blue, and all those other shows, and then now they call the cops on you when they see a gun case.
[01:35:34.733 --> 01:35:36.614]  Because they think guns are illegal.
[01:35:36.914 --> 01:35:38.155]  They think TV's real.
[01:35:39.253 --> 01:35:42.554]  One example, one small microcosm, and there's other ways that they do that.
[01:35:42.854 --> 01:35:47.775]  You know, the guy's a child molester, he owns guns, he also beats his wife, and he's ugly.
[01:35:48.635 --> 01:35:49.416]  You don't want guns.
[01:35:49.496 --> 01:35:50.076]  You don't want to be him.
[01:35:50.256 --> 01:35:59.838]  But the sharp, good-looking, young cop, she's going to get him and, you know, she sits there and tortures him to get the answers to save the kids and, you know, thank God that person ratted him out that they had a gun.
[01:35:59.858 --> 01:36:01.879]  You know, it's just every, oh, yeah.
[01:36:02.219 --> 01:36:05.960]  See, it's just all for these weak-minded people to suck him into this.
[01:36:10.973 --> 01:36:19.759]  So they want to control your mobility with face scanning cameras and DMVs and everybody, car rentals, hotels, to get a job, to buy alcohol.
[01:36:19.819 --> 01:36:21.980]  Now, to use a credit card, they want to see your ID.
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:22.981]  Now they're swiping it.
[01:36:23.261 --> 01:36:34.809]  They have big consortium meetings saying they're getting people ready to thumb scan and biometrically face scan to buy and sell for identity theft because they know there's cybersecurity rules and digitization of everything actually creates more of the theft.
[01:36:34.829 --> 01:36:35.910]  The government even admits that.
[01:36:36.210 --> 01:36:39.032]  But again, it creates more of a crisis to offer more of their solution.
[01:36:40.959 --> 01:36:43.240]  And so they glorify all these tattletale squads.
[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:47.221]  And you heard the guy earlier, and I've even seen their own documents, were Walmart and Target.
[01:36:47.661 --> 01:36:49.741]  Target really is another Pentagon front company.
[01:36:49.961 --> 01:36:53.763]  Their main business is actually security, surveillance cameras, data mining.
[01:36:54.283 --> 01:36:57.684]  Target stores only one part of their division out of Minnesota.
[01:36:57.704 --> 01:36:58.604]  It's a Pentagon front.
[01:36:59.404 --> 01:37:05.392]  And they admit they're watching you, and if you grab your kid by the arm in the store, you'll wonder why cops are there and CPS is there five minutes later.
[01:37:05.693 --> 01:37:07.375]  They also get kickbacks of that money.
[01:37:07.435 --> 01:37:09.378]  Target gets a lot of money, so does Walmart.
[01:37:09.638 --> 01:37:11.341]  One of their main profit centers is that.
[01:37:12.682 --> 01:37:15.606]  The USA Today reported four years ago,
[01:37:16.187 --> 01:37:19.288]  That headline, scofflaws get caught ordering pizzas.
[01:37:19.548 --> 01:37:22.029]  The big three pizza companies that have over half the U.S.
[01:37:22.069 --> 01:37:25.970]  market and more were joining in at the time through a private Dallas consortium.
[01:37:26.670 --> 01:37:39.354]  Again, the globalists always privatize all their data mining and police state for their companies that nexus in with government so the private people out of government can then go into private industry and actually make money off the police state grid mandated by government.
[01:37:39.714 --> 01:37:51.684]  And the thing was that whenever you call to get a pizza, they know that's your real address and your real name, so when they're running your credit card name, that's run through a NCIC criminal police database, so instead of a pizza, you get a SWAT team.
[01:37:54.806 --> 01:37:55.767]  Now that was four years ago.
[01:37:56.748 --> 01:38:00.050]  And they said they've been doing it for three years before that, so that's seven years they've been doing that.
[01:38:01.471 --> 01:38:03.593]  You starting to understand the control grid here, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:38:04.334 --> 01:38:08.297]  Hoosiers in there going, whoa, yeah, Google, uh, scofflaws ordering pizza.
[01:38:09.226 --> 01:38:12.008]  And then you'll get USA Today, and it'll explain.
[01:38:12.028 --> 01:38:15.511]  And that's just one I plug a lot every few months so people can look at that.
[01:38:15.551 --> 01:38:17.752]  I think that's particularly egregious for folks to understand it.
[01:38:19.233 --> 01:38:19.634]  Okay.
[01:38:20.714 --> 01:38:25.078]  When you buy stuff at Valero gas stations, they run your card for beer or cigarettes.
[01:38:25.098 --> 01:38:27.780]  They're going to phase it in everywhere for all products.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:28.900]  That's run through a database.
[01:38:30.021 --> 01:38:30.622]  Everything, folks.
[01:38:30.662 --> 01:38:32.063]  It's all... Yeah, there it is.
[01:38:32.123 --> 01:38:34.885]  Missouri tracks scoff laws via pizza delivery databases.
[01:38:35.879 --> 01:38:41.241]  And that's just an article about... I notice they always talk about it with one state, to make people not get alarmed.
[01:38:41.281 --> 01:38:42.221]  Nationwide, introduce it.
[01:38:42.421 --> 01:38:44.282]  This is nationwide, you learn in the article.
[01:38:44.542 --> 01:38:49.083]  But you introduce it as it's only one area, and not going on all over the place.
[01:38:49.103 --> 01:38:51.324]  They always say, oh, it's just a trial program.
[01:38:51.624 --> 01:38:52.625]  Oh, it's just the beginning.
[01:38:52.845 --> 01:38:56.286]  But you read here, they admit it's run out of Texas, we're the feds, it's nationwide.
[01:38:56.906 --> 01:38:57.707]  It's dinner time!
[01:38:57.747 --> 01:39:00.949]  You're hungry and tired, so you pick up the phone and order your favorite pizza.
[01:39:01.169 --> 01:39:04.152]  But you might have just landed yourself a lot more than pepperoni and cheese.
[01:39:04.512 --> 01:39:10.017]  If you have fines, fees, or the courts, the phone call may have provided the link to State Needed to track you down and make you pay.
[01:39:10.597 --> 01:39:15.561]  That's AP, and that was 2004, four and a half years ago.
[01:39:16.121 --> 01:39:16.322]  Hmm.
[01:39:17.362 --> 01:39:17.883]  There you have it.
[01:39:19.164 --> 01:39:20.225]  And again, there's thousands of this.
[01:39:20.285 --> 01:39:22.086]  It's just everything totally integrated.
[01:39:22.166 --> 01:39:24.508]  They admit it, not even me connecting the dots.
[01:39:24.568 --> 01:39:25.589]  It's all stated.
[01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:33.315]  And once the full grid's in place, you have more than one kid, they're going to come CPS the kid when it's born or abort him and blow your head off the next time.
[01:39:33.616 --> 01:39:35.577]  And they got devil dog cops ready to rock.
[01:39:36.418 --> 01:39:38.600]  I mean, it's just total hell is upon you, folks.
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:39.240]  You need to know that.
[01:39:40.421 --> 01:39:42.863]  The churches are going to tell you, lay down, that's the end of the world.
[01:39:42.903 --> 01:39:46.466]  But everybody's going to be here while this is happening, thinking it's the end of the world, laying down.
[01:39:49.778 --> 01:39:53.380]  Now, remember, again, I told you this thirteen years ago.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:40:00.525]  I had state reps on ten years ago, federal reps on six, seven years ago, and now it's been declassified.
[01:40:00.545 --> 01:40:11.312]  It's been all over the news that for thirty-six years, worldwide, in every IMF World Bank-controlled country, from Russia to Australia to England to the United States to Germany, blood is taken at birth.
[01:40:11.332 --> 01:40:14.834]  For thirty-six years, globally, it started an international secret agreement.
[01:40:15.154 --> 01:40:17.816]  Blood is taken and put in a DNA database
[01:40:18.456 --> 01:40:26.061]  And is sold to private biotech companies who then license and register your DNA type.
[01:40:26.101 --> 01:40:29.403]  So when you want gene therapy later, you gotta pay them for your own blood.
[01:40:29.644 --> 01:40:31.885]  It's also used so they can frame you with the blood they take.
[01:40:32.345 --> 01:40:33.967]  It's also used so they can track you.
[01:40:34.267 --> 01:40:38.309]  And so they can make race-specific bioweapons for you individually if they want.
[01:40:38.530 --> 01:40:44.814]  And they now admit for at least 10 years, they have laboratories that in one day can make a bioweapon which will only kill you.
[01:40:48.152 --> 01:40:55.455]  Or down to any sub-derivation or somebody that's 10% African from a certain area of Africa and a mix of Native American, they can kill you.
[01:40:55.475 --> 01:40:56.735]  Anything they want, they can kill you.
[01:40:56.995 --> 01:40:57.615]  They already have it.
[01:40:57.675 --> 01:41:01.437]  This is total, full-spectrum dominance, New World Order style.
[01:41:01.717 --> 01:41:02.757]  This is what they brag about.
[01:41:02.797 --> 01:41:03.937]  It's why it's so funny to them.
[01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:08.239]  They're going to orderly put in the control grid and then they're just going to start the slaughtering.
[01:41:08.659 --> 01:41:12.961]  All the killing and cancer you've seen so far is just the beginning of the soft-kill operation.
[01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:15.642]  Most of the cops, military listening, you're already dead.
[01:41:15.662 --> 01:41:16.582]  They've already implanted you.
[01:41:17.242 --> 01:41:26.844]  I mean, with the cancer viruses, which are hormonally, have hormonal fluctuation triggers, where when you have a certain hormonal fluctuation, on average around retirement, you'll be dead.
[01:41:27.544 --> 01:41:28.464]  And I'm sorry they murdered you.
[01:41:28.484 --> 01:41:29.664]  I'm sorry they murdered most of us.
[01:41:29.924 --> 01:41:37.266]  But before we die from their soft kill attack, now that we're aware of it, we can do damage to them and save others, and keep this iron grip from being able to make it all the way through.
[01:41:38.146 --> 01:41:40.506]  And I've got 0.4 of about 100.
[01:41:40.546 --> 01:41:43.767]  And I'm telling you folks, it just goes on and on.
[01:41:45.690 --> 01:41:47.412]  DNA Medical Mafia.
[01:41:49.114 --> 01:41:50.795]  Telling you it's the law, you gotta take shots.
[01:41:50.875 --> 01:41:54.719]  Now saying 60 plus shots are mandatory from just 10, when they're not mandatory.
[01:41:54.959 --> 01:41:56.921]  Trying to force injections on everybody.
[01:41:57.842 --> 01:42:00.544]  When you go in to have a baby, they say, do you have enough money?
[01:42:00.564 --> 01:42:02.186]  Does your husband mean to you?
[01:42:02.506 --> 01:42:04.008]  They ask the husband to leave the room.
[01:42:04.648 --> 01:42:06.770]  And they're entering into the health department database.
[01:42:06.850 --> 01:42:07.811]  Everybody's a spy.
[01:42:08.712 --> 01:42:11.553]  The census is now going to be yearly and then monthly.
[01:42:11.593 --> 01:42:12.534]  The feds have announced it.
[01:42:12.714 --> 01:42:17.215]  They're getting GPS of your door, coming to your house and threatening you if you don't answer hundreds of questions.
[01:42:17.575 --> 01:42:19.196]  Totally a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
[01:42:19.516 --> 01:42:20.296]  Total tyranny.
[01:42:20.316 --> 01:42:24.738]  They admit it's for drones, police, and federal police to know right where your doorstep is.
[01:42:25.078 --> 01:42:27.499]  Under law, they want to make you monthly answer questions.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:29.560]  Total police state.
[01:42:31.381 --> 01:42:35.922]  The Department of Homeland Security reports where they... How am I going to cover all this?
[01:42:35.982 --> 01:42:37.083]  I've got Webster Tarpley coming up.
[01:42:40.694 --> 01:42:42.616]  I could do this in three or four parts, I guess.
[01:42:43.697 --> 01:42:47.741]  I mean, folks, I haven't even... I haven't even gotten into it yet.
[01:42:47.821 --> 01:42:51.685]  I... I mean, it's just... I mean, believe me, everything I'm saying is on record.
[01:42:51.705 --> 01:42:54.247]  It's... I haven't even scratched the surface of the slave grid.
[01:42:55.028 --> 01:42:55.508]  You understand?
[01:42:55.528 --> 01:42:58.171]  They're killing all of us, including those of you that serve them.
[01:42:59.112 --> 01:43:01.294]  Don't laugh, it's real, and you know it is in your gut.
[01:43:02.795 --> 01:43:08.099]  It's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:24.292]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:43:24.592 --> 01:43:29.755]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:43:29.955 --> 01:43:36.259]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:43:36.479 --> 01:43:40.141]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:42.963]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:43:43.063 --> 01:43:48.426]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:43:48.746 --> 01:43:51.348]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:43:51.408 --> 01:43:53.609]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:56.111]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:43:56.151 --> 01:44:00.434]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[01:44:18.626 --> 01:44:19.947]  Call the Bailout Group today!
[01:44:44.258 --> 01:44:47.720]  With one simple call, let the Bailout Group bail you out of debt.

[01:44:53.563 --> 01:44:53.903]  The Bailout Group.
[01:45:01.252 --> 01:45:03.113]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:45:03.233 --> 01:45:08.375]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:45:08.395 --> 01:45:09.916]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:45:10.196 --> 01:45:18.379]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:45:18.599 --> 01:45:24.322]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:45:24.502 --> 01:45:26.283]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:45:26.343 --> 01:45:28.505]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:45:28.525 --> 01:45:32.867]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:45:33.048 --> 01:45:35.169]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:45:35.289 --> 01:45:43.034]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:45:45.575 --> 01:45:45.876]  That's 866-295-5305.
[01:45:45.896 --> 01:45:47.917]  Or order online at HBextract.com.
[01:45:47.957 --> 01:45:50.638]  Heart and Body Extract 866-295-5305 or HBextract.com.
[01:46:07.051 --> 01:46:10.294]  Okay, we got Tarpley coming up eight minutes into the next hour.
[01:46:10.314 --> 01:46:12.455]  I want to cover some financial news here in a moment.
[01:46:13.076 --> 01:46:18.019]  I'm going to have to do part two on this tomorrow of the cashless society control agreement.
[01:46:18.039 --> 01:46:22.683]  We can post it up at PrisonPlanet.tv and the YouTube channel and the rest of the places out there.
[01:46:23.223 --> 01:46:26.506]  Let me just give you some of the other points that we'll be getting into tomorrow on this.
[01:46:27.426 --> 01:46:28.327]  We'll do this in parts.
[01:46:31.389 --> 01:46:31.870]  This is the
[01:46:33.630 --> 01:46:33.890]  I think?
[01:46:49.318 --> 01:46:57.246]  All these new taxes and regulations, everything you do and say and buy will be inventoried on your global ID card for the carbon tax with carbon rationing.
[01:46:57.266 --> 01:46:58.607]  That's the official UN plan.
[01:46:58.988 --> 01:47:00.069]  Now Pelosi's saying it.
[01:47:00.089 --> 01:47:01.890]  I'm getting hundreds of emails going, how did you know this?
[01:47:02.211 --> 01:47:03.352]  It's all stated!
[01:47:04.656 --> 01:47:07.659]  DNA illegally taken at birth, now they admit it to the slaves.
[01:47:07.919 --> 01:47:10.161]  Force inoculations now openly being announced.
[01:47:10.681 --> 01:47:13.884]  The census lying and saying you've got to answer questions yearly and monthly.
[01:47:14.245 --> 01:47:16.166]  Running around getting GPS at your front door.
[01:47:17.047 --> 01:47:21.831]  The face scanners, the thumbprint scanners, the license plate readers everywhere you go tracking you.
[01:47:22.672 --> 01:47:29.799]  DHS reports saying gun owners, veterans, those that talk about the Constitution, those that wear, you know, Patriot
[01:47:31.074 --> 01:47:33.675]  Don't tread on me t-shirts or bumper stickers or terrorists.
[01:47:33.995 --> 01:47:35.915]  Most of the Homeland Security funding being spent on that.
[01:47:36.216 --> 01:47:38.636]  The Patriot Act being used in non-terror related cases.
[01:47:39.096 --> 01:47:49.479]  Patriot Act compliance with no more warrants with the feds tied in to the bank's databases looking at everything you buy, sell and do.
[01:47:49.519 --> 01:47:50.980]  Looking at all your transactions.
[01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:52.260]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:47:53.387 --> 01:48:01.334]  You know, the biggest one of these no-fly lists, where now if you are on the 1.1 million people and growing by 25,000 a month, no-fly list, you can't own a gun.
[01:48:01.574 --> 01:48:13.925]  They're already using that and refusing people that are on it to buy guns, and veterans to buy guns, even without PTSD, and that's on record, but now they're trying to make it law with the no-fly, no-buy.
[01:48:14.986 --> 01:48:24.983]  Meanwhile, all over the country, the states are making the police license plates and their private car license plates and the bureaucrats and state and federal people where their license plates can't be read.
[01:48:27.052 --> 01:48:31.074]  And where they can speed, get in trouble, basically can't get arrested.
[01:48:31.094 --> 01:48:32.095]  That's mainstream news.
[01:48:32.135 --> 01:48:34.196]  So, we're all slaves being tracked.
[01:48:34.496 --> 01:48:45.563]  If they don't like you, as they admit, anti-war groups on no-fly list, anti-torture groups on no-fly list, congressmen on no-fly list, can't get off, can't find out why you're on it, don't have a second amendment once they do it.
[01:48:45.903 --> 01:48:46.683]  I mean, that's total 1984.
[01:48:49.495 --> 01:48:59.639]  They're using debt to control people, bankrupting us financially, so we have to go to the government hat in hand with their new mobile medical vans and their FEMA centers with medical centers where we want to go to the FEMA camps.
[01:49:03.561 --> 01:49:10.004]  Again, the key here is that the globalists make money and get power and control out of
[01:49:11.838 --> 01:49:15.801]  Owning the private company systems that then government contracts with to implement all this.
[01:49:16.101 --> 01:49:18.503]  It's a revolving door between industry and government.
[01:49:19.043 --> 01:49:23.327]  So they also profit off of their police state that they use to control us.
[01:49:23.827 --> 01:49:24.968]  And that's how this thing grows.
[01:49:25.628 --> 01:49:33.654]  And tomorrow I will carve out an entire hour and make sure I get to the rest of all this and recap what we've already covered.
[01:49:33.674 --> 01:49:36.396]  But that gives you just a window into the control grid.
[01:49:36.676 --> 01:49:38.178]  So we'll get into a lot more tomorrow.
[01:49:38.198 --> 01:49:39.859]  That's about 10% of what I'm going to be covering.
[01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:43.311]  Because we got Tarpley coming up, and I just ran out of time.
[01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:45.252]  I wanted to get into this.
[01:49:45.312 --> 01:49:50.133]  Remember two days ago, Geithner tells China its dollar assets are safe, and it was in the news that he got laughed at?
[01:49:50.734 --> 01:49:54.155]  Well now, dollar declines as nation mulls reserve currency alternative.
[01:49:55.026 --> 01:50:00.649]  And it says in Bloomberg, the world is going ahead and deciding what the new world currency will be.
[01:50:00.689 --> 01:50:06.612]  Well, they're going to have a basket of currencies at first, and then go to a pure face scan, thumb print global currency.
[01:50:06.872 --> 01:50:09.633]  They're going to go right past the Amaro, right past it all.
[01:50:09.653 --> 01:50:15.957]  You'll still have regional currencies that have your local look, but it's like there's 15 different, you know, Sports Illustrated.
[01:50:15.997 --> 01:50:17.237]  It's all printed by the same people.
[01:50:17.517 --> 01:50:18.218]  It's standardized.
[01:50:18.798 --> 01:50:19.899]  All the same databases.
[01:50:20.359 --> 01:50:24.041]  But that will be globally identified with a thumb print and a face scan,
[01:50:25.256 --> 01:50:31.379]  When you use a regional currency set by the New Bank of the World, that will set interest rates, currency rates, and everything.
[01:50:31.679 --> 01:50:35.961]  So, you'll still have paper money, it's just tied to the Cashless Society tracking system.
[01:50:36.121 --> 01:50:37.882]  We'll break this down in 60 seconds.
[01:50:38.182 --> 01:50:39.303]  Stay with us, it's key.
[01:50:42.524 --> 01:50:43.845]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:50:43.905 --> 01:50:47.106]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:50.751 --> 01:50:56.323]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[01:50:56.623 --> 01:50:57.786]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:50:57.926 --> 01:51:01.834]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called Inner Food.
[01:51:02.182 --> 01:51:03.763]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:51:04.043 --> 01:51:10.347]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:51:11.508 --> 01:51:14.049]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:51:14.370 --> 01:51:15.850]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:51:16.111 --> 01:51:18.892]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:51:19.113 --> 01:51:20.573]  And their formula really works.
[01:51:20.834 --> 01:51:23.395]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:51:23.635 --> 01:51:29.539]  Try the NutriCafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:51:29.887 --> 01:51:32.089]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:51:32.309 --> 01:51:34.571]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.
[01:51:34.771 --> 01:51:36.532]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:51:36.872 --> 01:51:42.356]  Go to www.enerfood.com.
[01:51:42.556 --> 01:51:47.020]  That's www.enerfood.com.

[01:51:53.709 --> 01:51:55.590]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:58.892]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:51:59.432 --> 01:52:00.092]  Initiate.
[01:52:15.441 --> 01:52:21.384]  This is the controlled implosion of our economy by design stated on record by the globalists.
[01:52:23.228 --> 01:52:25.431]  I believe they miscalculated and it's going to blow up in their face.
[01:52:25.451 --> 01:52:27.053]  You better hope so for the future of humanity.
[01:52:27.954 --> 01:52:30.737]  We got Webster Griffin Tarbley coming up in the next segment.
[01:52:31.118 --> 01:52:40.289]  Right now I wanted to bring Jim Newcomer up because gold is above 980 today, exploding yet again towards the 1000 mark.
[01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:41.611]  And Jim Newcomer
[01:52:42.592 --> 01:52:46.193]  It's got gold and silver priced in the market at $9.30, $9.40.
[01:52:46.273 --> 01:52:53.396]  With the gold and the silver priced into the market when it was a dollar or more under what it is now.
[01:52:53.836 --> 01:53:02.179]  Many other brokers and gold and silver outfits are completely sold out of their selling for huge premiums.
[01:53:02.699 --> 01:53:07.360]  I wanted to have Jim Newcomer up for just a few minutes before Webster Griffin-Tarpley joins us.
[01:53:07.841 --> 01:53:10.942]  GM going under and, you know, I'm not even tooting my horn here.
[01:53:14.042 --> 01:53:27.654]  Jim Newcomer, but we told people two and a half years ago that GM was going to go under by design and that it was going to be moved to China and Brazil, and Burmese came running in here breathing heavy earlier saying, you were right, you were right.
[01:53:28.275 --> 01:53:29.015]  Yeah, yeah, here it is.
[01:53:29.476 --> 01:53:33.879]  AP sourced GM to sell Hummer to Chinese company, but that's only the beginning.
[01:53:33.919 --> 01:53:38.523]  I have about five or six articles I printed this morning because I wanted to make this point and back it up.
[01:53:39.346 --> 01:53:49.410]  And somebody's got to find the tapes of me and Bob Chapman two and a half years ago saying this, and then two years ago, and a year ago, and six months ago, and last week, that this is all by design.
[01:53:49.570 --> 01:53:50.711]  That's why they federalized it.
[01:53:51.011 --> 01:53:57.153]  And this is them handing our industry over to foreigners with money to finance it leaving the country, not just Hummer.
[01:53:57.654 --> 01:54:00.095]  Then they're announcing their Chinese division's doing great.
[01:54:00.535 --> 01:54:03.756]  I mean, I've never seen such raping, Jim Newcomer.
[01:54:04.477 --> 01:54:05.397]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:54:05.637 --> 01:54:06.637]  I agree with you 100%.
[01:54:06.678 --> 01:54:07.798]  What's going on is criminal.
[01:54:09.382 --> 01:54:14.005]  I think years ago there was the old adage that as General Motors goes, so goes America.
[01:54:14.525 --> 01:54:16.867]  Maybe it's a precursor of what's to come.
[01:54:18.483 --> 01:54:19.804]  I don't think it may be.
[01:54:20.505 --> 01:54:22.106]  Until we arrest the bankers, it's over.
[01:54:22.146 --> 01:54:23.327]  Until we end the Fed, it's over.
[01:54:24.148 --> 01:54:26.410]  Jim, people don't get into gold and silver now.
[01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:32.175]  I don't know what to tell them, whether it's one silver coin or a hundred, or whether it's one gold coin or five.
[01:54:32.936 --> 01:54:34.618]  Tell folks the great deals you've got today.
[01:54:34.938 --> 01:54:38.081]  Well, the precious metals are real money and they're real value.
[01:54:38.361 --> 01:54:42.265]  Today we've got two of the coins that are most traded in the industry.
[01:54:42.285 --> 01:54:42.885]  That's the $20 Liberty.
[01:54:43.962 --> 01:54:45.043]  At $1,632.60, the $10 Liberty is running $818.50.
[01:54:45.123 --> 01:54:47.025]  We have the Walking Liberty Half Dollars.
[01:54:47.045 --> 01:54:49.326]  These were minted from 1918 to 1947 at $183.60 per roll of $20.
[01:54:49.867 --> 01:54:51.648]  We have the British Sovereigns again at $285.93.
[01:54:51.728 --> 01:54:52.029]  Franks at $231.50.
[01:54:52.069 --> 01:54:54.631]  And the ever popular, the Lakota National Silver Rounds are still available at $434.40 a roll.
[01:55:12.891 --> 01:55:14.932]  What does that come out to a piece?
[01:55:15.893 --> 01:55:17.454]  On the Lakotas, it's $21.72.
[01:55:17.654 --> 01:55:21.496]  Now you can go online, you can search these things out, you're going to pay $25, $26.
[01:55:21.876 --> 01:55:23.597]  No, I know, they've gone up.
[01:55:23.697 --> 01:55:26.479]  They were $25 a month ago, when you guys were selling them for $16.
[01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:30.101]  I mean, amazing.
[01:55:30.141 --> 01:55:31.522]  What about those Franklin halves?
[01:55:31.542 --> 01:55:32.482]  That's really a good deal.
[01:55:32.683 --> 01:55:33.943]  The Franklin halves are gone.
[01:55:34.003 --> 01:55:37.766]  We had to replace that with the Walking Liberty, but the Walking Liberty half dollar is even older.
[01:55:39.182 --> 01:55:40.723]  It's a great value at $9.18.
[01:55:41.203 --> 01:55:43.144]  They're at $183.60 per roll.
[01:55:43.164 --> 01:55:44.665]  We were real lucky to be able to find them.
[01:55:44.685 --> 01:55:46.046]  How long can you hold that?
[01:55:46.066 --> 01:55:48.407]  Because this is priced into the market a week or two ago.
[01:55:49.147 --> 01:55:51.349]  How long can you hold these deals before it goes up again?
[01:55:51.649 --> 01:55:53.690]  Well, that's hard to say, Alex.
[01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:59.353]  We're going to try to hold it to the end of the week, but if the market takes off, it's going to be almost impossible for us.
[01:56:00.271 --> 01:56:00.832]  No, no, no.
[01:56:00.912 --> 01:56:02.953]  Explain to people, you bought silver and gold.
[01:56:02.973 --> 01:56:13.521]  Again, you keep buying it when it's low and still selling it for the low price, but you keep running out so it goes up, but by the time you go up, it's already gone up again, so you're passing huge savings on to people.
[01:56:13.801 --> 01:56:22.047]  Yep, we'll secure a lot of it, and when that lot is gone, I mean, the response has been so tremendous, people calling in and ordering this.
[01:56:22.447 --> 01:56:24.328]  Then a lot of times we'll run out of what we purchased.
[01:56:24.388 --> 01:56:26.910]  We endeavor to hold the price as long as we possibly can.
[01:56:42.188 --> 01:56:43.449]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:56:43.749 --> 01:56:45.830]  These are great, great deals on gold and silver.
[01:56:46.211 --> 01:56:47.912]  It's a company I believe in and that I trust.
[01:56:47.952 --> 01:56:49.613]  I think you should call right now, 800-686-2237.
[01:56:49.633 --> 01:56:56.757]  We're going to go ahead and get Webster Tarpley online, but I've got one more question for Jim Newcomer when we come back.
[01:56:56.857 --> 01:56:57.918]  Jim, stay there.
[01:56:58.238 --> 01:56:59.399]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:00.831 --> 01:57:05.834]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:57:06.054 --> 01:57:09.837]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:10.077 --> 01:57:15.680]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:16.421]  It's true.
[01:57:16.621 --> 01:57:20.823]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:57:21.044 --> 01:57:27.408]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:57:27.588 --> 01:57:28.028]  Number four,
[01:57:28.228 --> 01:57:30.891]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:57:31.151 --> 01:57:34.414]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:57:34.434 --> 01:57:38.538]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science.
[01:57:43.422 --> 01:57:43.882]  We're good.
[01:58:01.365 --> 01:58:02.927]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:03.047 --> 01:58:07.653]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:07.793 --> 01:58:10.556]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:58:10.756 --> 01:58:13.620]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:18.506]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:58:18.746 --> 01:58:19.687]  If you simply prepare.
[01:58:19.867 --> 01:58:22.829]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:30.033]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:58:30.114 --> 01:58:33.236]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:58:33.376 --> 01:58:35.257]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com
[01:58:38.519 --> 01:58:44.583]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:58:44.783 --> 01:58:48.525]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:58:48.545 --> 01:58:50.046]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:58:50.086 --> 01:58:50.507]  Take action today.
[01:58:50.527 --> 01:58:52.508]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:02.234 --> 01:59:17.309]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:19.011]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica.
[01:59:20.652 --> 01:59:21.173]  I think so.
[01:59:44.036 --> 01:59:44.636]  We're going to
[02:00:14.352 --> 02:00:17.634]  Webster Tarpley here in just a moment with the balance of the hour and your phone calls.
[02:00:17.654 --> 02:00:25.257]  And I wanted to give you just a little window into this internal Midas Resources memorandum.
[02:00:25.937 --> 02:00:28.699]  I get sent these about special deals they're offering.
[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:36.462]  And I don't even know if I'm supposed to do this, but it says Lakota Nation Silver Round offer price $21.72.
[02:00:39.268 --> 02:00:40.810]  Or $434.40 a roll.
[02:00:40.830 --> 02:00:45.875]  The base cost on the trade is $20.68.
[02:00:46.415 --> 02:00:53.562]  I mean, they're making a dollar and a couple pennies on that.
[02:00:54.423 --> 02:00:56.164]  I mean, that's the markup on these things.
[02:00:57.105 --> 02:01:00.308]  I'm looking at gold coins here that are
[02:01:01.414 --> 02:01:04.576]  You know, $231, they're making $5 on the coin.
[02:01:04.936 --> 02:01:06.777]  I mean, you can't keep the lights on for that.
[02:01:06.837 --> 02:01:15.983]  These are specials that Ted is offering, and he's getting huge bulk discounts on these, and he's buying it when gold is low, and people aren't smart.
[02:01:16.003 --> 02:01:16.923]  They don't buy when it's low.
[02:01:16.943 --> 02:01:17.524]  That's when I buy.
[02:01:19.045 --> 02:01:20.686]  They buy when it's high, so Ted does...
[02:01:21.798 --> 02:01:24.921]  Sells it to you at the low price when it's high.
[02:01:25.481 --> 02:01:27.123]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[02:01:27.743 --> 02:01:36.191]  So I just wanted to explain to the listeners, the deals we're offering here, if they call up and don't say it's the Alex Jones Special, they're going to get a higher price that's still a great price.
[02:01:36.511 --> 02:01:38.233]  These are special loss leaders.
[02:01:38.613 --> 02:01:39.614]  Are they not, Jim Newcomer?
[02:01:39.634 --> 02:01:43.998]  That's absolutely true and be sure to ask for the Alex Jones Special so that you get these prices.
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:46.161]  You know, how does Ted do this?
[02:01:46.221 --> 02:01:48.164]  How does Ted sell gold and silver?
[02:01:48.184 --> 02:01:50.046]  Because I always look at these and I've been up there.
[02:01:50.066 --> 02:01:51.769]  I know these are the prices he's paying.
[02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:53.090]  How does he do that?
[02:01:53.330 --> 02:01:55.093]  Well, to be honest with you, he amazes us.
[02:01:55.233 --> 02:01:59.098]  And I'm just waiting for him to get back from Europe this weekend so we can see what he's bringing with him.
[02:02:01.431 --> 02:02:03.492]  Yeah, it's just absolutely incredible.
[02:02:03.512 --> 02:02:03.832]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:04.952 --> 02:02:14.315]  Those deals you're offering on the Franks, on the British Sovereigns, on the Liberty VF, on the Liberty 10, it's just all excellent.
[02:02:14.335 --> 02:02:14.615]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:14.876 --> 02:02:15.876]  Jim Newcomer, anything else?
[02:02:16.376 --> 02:02:17.576]  No, sir, but have a great afternoon.
[02:02:18.077 --> 02:02:18.437]  Take care.
[02:02:18.817 --> 02:02:20.998]  You know, I didn't tell Webster Tarpley I was going to do this.
[02:02:21.038 --> 02:02:22.618]  By the way, he's in the new Obama film coming up.
[02:02:23.138 --> 02:02:25.039]  One of the main, kind of like the narrator of it.
[02:02:26.459 --> 02:02:28.340]  A bunch of people for this film, wait till you hear about it.
[02:02:29.101 --> 02:02:46.471]  Side issue, the point is, I haven't talked to Tarpley in about a month and a half since he was last here for shooting for the new film, and so much has gone on, I want to pick his brain on that, and I know you do as well, but Tarpley, let me just throw this out at you, because I don't know your view, I know you're an economist, shot in the dark,
[02:02:47.637 --> 02:02:50.039]  And so, I know you'll tell me what you really think.
[02:02:50.479 --> 02:02:58.927]  Do you think gold and silver in this crazy economy is something smart to get into, or should folks hold on to their world currencies and hold on to their stocks and bonds?
[02:02:59.707 --> 02:03:03.530]  I would strongly suggest, Alex, first of all, hi and thanks for having me back.
[02:03:03.951 --> 02:03:06.673]  I would strongly suggest that everybody have a gold hedge.
[02:03:07.494 --> 02:03:12.318]  A certain significant percentage of whatever you own ought to be in primarily gold.
[02:03:12.918 --> 02:03:15.761]  And you can see this, we've had this flap of interest
[02:03:16.341 --> 02:03:37.158]  In the past two weeks, when Standard & Poor's says that the sovereign debt of the United Kingdom, of the British, is going to be degraded down from AAA level to something less, that is, chunkified, and then Bill Gross of PIMCO comes out, the bond king, of course, and says, yeah, and that's going to happen to Treasury bonds, too, that's very, very ominous.
[02:03:37.178 --> 02:03:42.322]  What you've got right now is, of course, the dollar falling rather rapidly, 143 against the euro.
[02:03:42.362 --> 02:03:43.443]  Remember, the dollar had been
[02:03:43.963 --> 02:03:56.177]  For some crazy reasons in the financial system, the dollar had been relatively strong over the last six months or so, but even more so the interest rate on the 30-year long bond of the Treasury.
[02:03:56.197 --> 02:04:00.482]  In other words, when the price goes down, the interest rate goes up.
[02:04:00.942 --> 02:04:12.025]  So this was about 2.5% on the 30-year-long bond in December, and now it's 4.5%, so that's 2% in less than six months, and that's a big move for bonds.
[02:04:12.045 --> 02:04:15.526]  They don't jump around, or are not supposed to, in the same way that stocks do.
[02:04:15.566 --> 02:04:29.589]  So I think what you're looking at right now is inflation shading over into hyperinflation, shading over into hyperstagflation, and in the middle of that, I think it's still probably, you still have a while to buy some gold.
[02:04:30.309 --> 02:04:32.332]  Uh, before it starts going further up.
[02:04:32.352 --> 02:04:33.454]  And some people despair.
[02:04:33.494 --> 02:04:37.920]  They say, well, I should have bought it when it was 400 or 500 or something like that.
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:39.202]  Now it's about a thousand, I guess.
[02:04:39.803 --> 02:04:41.746]  And, uh, they think that it's too late.
[02:04:41.766 --> 02:04:42.387]  It's not too late.
[02:04:42.427 --> 02:04:44.490]  I think it's probably still a very good thing to have.
[02:04:45.816 --> 02:04:57.124]  Well absolutely, but if people try to get gold and silver once the run starts, and people think this is a run on it, this is only the beginning of the gold rush, historically you're not going to be able to get it for any price.
[02:04:57.424 --> 02:04:58.345]  It's going to be really serious.
[02:04:59.626 --> 02:05:02.668]  Webster, I see a crisis worldwide in all major currencies.
[02:05:03.848 --> 02:05:13.535]  But centering around the pound and the dollar, as you were just saying, you've been ranting and raving for years about GM and Chrysler going under and what this would mean, now devastating.
[02:05:14.035 --> 02:05:31.488]  Now they're saying we'll give you billions, but under IMF, World Bank, World Trade Organization agreements, as you know, but listeners, some may not, just like with the stimulus package, that had to be open for bids worldwide, and a lot of it went overseas, because under these globalist agreements, you can't have the government
[02:05:32.383 --> 02:05:34.364]  Quote, subsidizing its industry.
[02:05:34.444 --> 02:05:36.744]  So, we're told this is socialism, but it's not.
[02:05:36.784 --> 02:05:43.706]  It's a pure cash gift to foreign offshore plutocratic bankers, as you say.
[02:05:44.186 --> 02:05:57.470]  And now it's in the news that not only is Hummer going to China, but all the major industry of GM, the vast majority, is going to Opel of Europe, and to China, and to Brazil, and that American taxpayers will
[02:05:57.870 --> 02:05:58.390]  We're good to go.
[02:06:27.890 --> 02:06:33.471]  Well, first of all, it is a world economic depression of incalculable proportions.
[02:06:33.531 --> 02:06:43.993]  And I urge everybody, we've just passed this milestone, when General Motors and Chrysler are both bankrupt, that means the United States is in a very severe economic depression.
[02:06:44.033 --> 02:06:48.014]  So stop, people should stop looking at all these things.
[02:06:48.054 --> 02:06:50.795]  They didn't go bankrupt in 29, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[02:06:51.315 --> 02:06:52.497]  Right, no, they've survived.
[02:06:52.517 --> 02:06:54.879]  This is now the lowest stock price they've ever had.
[02:06:54.919 --> 02:06:58.083]  And of course, they didn't go bankrupt in the Great Depression, but now they did.
[02:06:58.423 --> 02:07:00.225]  And they've been driven into bankruptcy.
[02:07:00.265 --> 02:07:09.316]  They were consciously, deliberately driven into bankruptcy by the Obama regime, with Larry Summers, Tiny Tim Geithner, and two villains in particular.
[02:07:09.776 --> 02:07:17.299]  Steve Ratner, alias Ratner the Rat, who has been the head of this auto task force that Obama has.
[02:07:17.699 --> 02:07:21.740]  And then his right-hand man, his running dog, is a guy called Brian Deese.
[02:07:22.161 --> 02:07:23.581]  D-E-S-E.
[02:07:24.121 --> 02:07:26.642]  And these are two Wall Street jackals.
[02:07:26.762 --> 02:07:28.563]  These are the typical finance boys.
[02:07:29.313 --> 02:07:34.935]  Uh, if you look back over the history of GM, recent decades, it has been destroyed by the finance side.
[02:07:34.975 --> 02:07:45.537]  There's a big tension in any industrial corporation between the industrial engineers on the one side, the people who know production, or maybe sales and marketing, and then the pure Wall Street characters.
[02:07:45.597 --> 02:07:47.658]  And ever since the era of Roger Smith,
[02:07:48.158 --> 02:07:56.286]  Back in the 1980s and approximately then, the finance side of General Motors has triumphed over the other side.
[02:07:56.366 --> 02:07:57.927]  So they've weakened the corporation.
[02:07:58.408 --> 02:08:05.935]  But as we saw at the beginning of April, Obama cynically, deliberately decided that he would drive General Motors into bankruptcy.
[02:08:06.678 --> 02:08:10.060]  For the purpose, among other things, of busting the United Auto Workers.
[02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:13.762]  The United Auto Workers, these poor guys, I sympathize with them.
[02:08:14.202 --> 02:08:17.984]  They voted on Thursday and Friday to vote themselves out of existence.
[02:08:18.044 --> 02:08:20.525]  The trade union movement in the United States
[02:08:22.196 --> 02:08:36.288]  And that's exactly, Webster, that's exactly what you said a year plus ago about Obama.
[02:08:36.328 --> 02:08:40.492]  You said he's the left cover to butcher all of what's left of the industries.
[02:08:40.512 --> 02:08:43.355]  Can you imagine if George Bush or John McCain would have told him to do this?
[02:08:43.595 --> 02:08:48.219]  But if Obama tells him, they just fall over and now the left goes, yeah, he's torturing
[02:08:48.519 --> 02:08:50.902]  Yeah, he's lying, but he's our liar and we love him.
[02:08:51.182 --> 02:08:55.027]  I mean, this is total moral bankruptcy by the left in this country.
[02:08:55.047 --> 02:08:55.348]  Go ahead.
[02:08:55.628 --> 02:09:04.079]  Right, I hope that the support for Obama among these deluded Kool-Aid drinkers will collapse soon, but as you say, right now, it hasn't done so.
[02:09:05.490 --> 02:09:07.711]  Obama is a professional union buster.
[02:09:07.891 --> 02:09:09.411]  That is his family business.
[02:09:09.951 --> 02:09:16.133]  The Ford Foundation and the other foundations, the Annenberg, the Joyce, the Woods, the Camellial and so forth that he's worked for.
[02:09:16.694 --> 02:09:17.674]  What is their business?
[02:09:17.774 --> 02:09:19.114]  What is Solominsky?
[02:09:19.394 --> 02:09:21.075]  Solominsky is a union buster.
[02:09:21.295 --> 02:09:30.638]  He hates the New Deal, he hates industrial trade unionism, and his racket is to organize poor people, people who have basically nothing but despair,
[02:09:31.198 --> 02:09:33.461]  And use them as strike breakers and as a counter to that.
[02:09:33.501 --> 02:09:34.982]  Same thing with carbon taxes.
[02:09:35.042 --> 02:09:47.495]  They are now admitting in major British papers that this will ship all the dirty industry to the third world with no controls and then they get none of the benefits and then we have no industry here.
[02:09:47.895 --> 02:09:50.198]  All it helps is the consolidators.
[02:09:50.967 --> 02:09:52.248]  Yeah, and the asset strippers.
[02:09:52.268 --> 02:09:54.869]  Let's call them asset strippers, the breakup artists.
[02:09:54.929 --> 02:10:04.074]  Because what Obama has done, therefore, is to drive these companies into bankruptcy so that they would be at the mercy of various groups of asset strippers.
[02:10:04.114 --> 02:10:10.717]  Now, I actually think Opel has fared rather well in the sense that Opel has been bought up, essentially, by Russia, right?
[02:10:10.757 --> 02:10:18.961]  It's SpareBank of Russia that has really taken control of Opel with their plans to go full-time there in the Rhein-Main area of Germany.
[02:10:19.021 --> 02:10:20.662]  And the Russians obviously want this.
[02:10:20.742 --> 02:10:32.045]  Look, I understand you like the Russians and you think they're being bullied on, but still, for national security, GM's being gotten by the Russians in Europe, the Communist Chinese are getting parts of it, and so is Brazil.
[02:10:32.405 --> 02:10:33.106]  This is horrible!
[02:10:33.146 --> 02:10:34.166]  This is unbelievable!
[02:10:34.326 --> 02:10:37.307]  No, it's a disaster for the United States.
[02:10:37.567 --> 02:10:38.727]  And we're paying for it!
[02:10:39.368 --> 02:10:43.949]  You can't blame these other people for picking up valuable things when the Wall Street jackals and parasites
[02:10:44.549 --> 02:10:45.130]  Go to work.
[02:10:45.930 --> 02:10:47.612]  Let me just describe what this process is.
[02:10:47.652 --> 02:10:48.332]  This has a name.
[02:10:48.673 --> 02:10:51.695]  This is the Mussolini fascist corporate state.
[02:10:51.875 --> 02:10:55.959]  And let me just tax your patience here with a definition of what that is.
[02:10:56.439 --> 02:10:57.880]  The fascist corporate state.
[02:10:57.940 --> 02:11:02.704]  First of all, that corporate doesn't necessarily mean corporation in the modern term of a stock company.
[02:11:02.924 --> 02:11:03.725]  It means a guild.
[02:11:04.105 --> 02:11:08.309]  It means, you know, the master, the journeyman, and the apprentice, the medieval organization.
[02:11:08.329 --> 02:11:12.312]  So government, labor, and management are fused into one block.
[02:11:12.352 --> 02:11:13.033]  They're merged.
[02:11:13.673 --> 02:11:16.094]  But it's the banking interest that dominates.
[02:11:16.154 --> 02:11:17.495]  It's not the government interest.
[02:11:17.555 --> 02:11:22.558]  It's not like government bureaucrats of some kind of professional caste like in China.
[02:11:22.978 --> 02:11:27.100]  It's a banking crime guild that uses government as a legitimizer of enforcement.
[02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:27.941]  Right.
[02:11:28.161 --> 02:11:31.623]  Washington is an annex of Wall Street, a wholly owned puppet.
[02:11:31.643 --> 02:11:32.903]  Well, that's of course what Obama is.
[02:11:32.943 --> 02:11:33.924]  He's a wholly owned puppet.
[02:11:34.324 --> 02:11:36.006]  All right, Webster, stay there.
[02:11:36.046 --> 02:11:39.028]  Let's break down where the economy's going and how you see things shaking up.
[02:11:39.048 --> 02:11:41.550]  We'll also get into a bunch of other subjects like youth brigades.
[02:12:01.092 --> 02:12:02.333]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:12:02.393 --> 02:12:07.718]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:12:07.979 --> 02:12:12.603]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:12:13.004 --> 02:12:18.069]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:12:18.569 --> 02:12:23.274]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:12:23.814 --> 02:12:25.676]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:12:26.098 --> 02:12:30.701]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:12:30.901 --> 02:12:31.801]  And here's the best part.
[02:12:32.022 --> 02:12:34.763]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:12:34.783 --> 02:12:38.405]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:12:38.705 --> 02:12:41.547]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:12:41.887 --> 02:12:43.788]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:12:44.109 --> 02:12:45.049]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:12:45.069 --> 02:12:45.269]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:12:45.309 --> 02:12:46.370]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:12:55.205 --> 02:12:57.449]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:12:57.749 --> 02:13:00.194]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:13:01.556 --> 02:13:06.785]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:13:07.566 --> 02:13:12.910]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:13:13.451 --> 02:13:19.635]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:13:19.955 --> 02:13:21.777]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:13:21.917 --> 02:13:24.319]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:13:24.379 --> 02:13:35.267]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:13:37.555 --> 02:13:38.836]  It's not about left or right.
[02:13:39.236 --> 02:13:40.597]  It's about a one world government.
[02:13:41.098 --> 02:13:47.403]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:13:48.003 --> 02:13:55.789]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:13:56.270 --> 02:13:57.411]  The Obama Deception.
[02:13:57.831 --> 02:13:59.032]  The people strike back.
[02:14:00.643 --> 02:14:01.603]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:14:01.683 --> 02:14:06.465]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:14:06.625 --> 02:14:14.428]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:14:14.708 --> 02:14:20.070]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:14:20.290 --> 02:14:27.252]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:14:27.552 --> 02:14:32.874]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:14:33.155 --> 02:14:37.877]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:14:38.217 --> 02:14:45.840]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:52.403]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:14:52.723 --> 02:14:53.844]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:14:56.567 --> 02:14:59.489]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:03.611]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:15:03.751 --> 02:15:08.973]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:15:09.154 --> 02:15:13.936]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:15:14.116 --> 02:15:25.102]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:15:25.362 --> 02:15:30.927]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[02:15:31.108 --> 02:15:37.194]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:15:37.354 --> 02:15:37.994]  What about you?
[02:15:38.215 --> 02:15:40.116]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[02:15:40.136 --> 02:15:44.260]  $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[02:15:44.441 --> 02:15:46.683]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-866-KDF.
[02:15:46.903 --> 02:15:47.183]  That's right.
[02:16:16.155 --> 02:16:21.796]  Before we ever come this way again, we're gonna ride.
[02:16:22.037 --> 02:16:27.738]  Man, I could listen to this music all day.
[02:16:45.528 --> 02:16:58.460]  Going back to Webster Tarpley.
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:16:59.901]  Okay, Webster, my friend.
[02:16:59.921 --> 02:17:02.463]  We'll talk about your new book, by the way, that I should be carrying in the bookstore.
[02:17:02.483 --> 02:17:06.647]  We carry our two books on Obama and your book on 9-11, Synthetic Terror, at InfoWars.com.
[02:17:06.667 --> 02:17:07.528]  My name's Robert.
[02:17:08.709 --> 02:17:09.853]  Surviving the Cataclysm.
[02:17:09.893 --> 02:17:11.076]  You predicted this 10 years ago.
[02:17:11.116 --> 02:17:12.299]  It's republished and updated.
[02:17:12.319 --> 02:17:14.425]  I just love people that have a track record.
[02:17:14.486 --> 02:17:15.188]  Yours is so good.
[02:17:18.242 --> 02:17:22.646]  Before we go, the question of the fascist corporate state, because this is important for people to understand.
[02:17:23.067 --> 02:17:30.694]  The fascist corporate state is a state-sponsored compulsory cartel, and it means that Geithner and Summers have picked the winners.
[02:17:31.074 --> 02:17:41.825]  The winners are JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and they're trying to save Citibank if they can, because that's Bob Rubin, who is sort of the grey eminence of this entire clique.
[02:17:42.395 --> 02:17:53.899]  So, they are going to run the General Motors bankruptcy in such a way as to save JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, and sacrifice everybody else.
[02:17:53.939 --> 02:17:55.299]  And that's what people are screaming about.
[02:17:55.860 --> 02:18:05.483]  The other groups, Oppenheimer, and Stairway, and a couple of these other hedge funds, have been sacrificed because they're not part of the state-sponsored compulsory cartel.
[02:18:05.723 --> 02:18:06.703]  But notice what's happening.
[02:18:07.044 --> 02:18:08.024]  Production goes down.
[02:18:08.664 --> 02:18:09.505]  No, this is a complete hoax!
[02:18:09.525 --> 02:18:10.265]  This is a complete...
[02:18:31.298 --> 02:18:49.330]  I know, I mean, let me be clear, I'm not, exactly, this is a mass hoax to call this socialism, that's why the media says it every day, every night, in hundreds of publications, they print that headline, that this is Marxism, this is just piracy, this is high seas, swashbuckling, knock us on the head, is it not?
[02:18:49.878 --> 02:18:50.859]  Absolutely illegal.
[02:18:50.899 --> 02:18:54.100]  Now, you've probably seen the Greg Palast article, which I think is very useful.
[02:18:54.421 --> 02:18:59.023]  You could see all these right-wing characters saying, yeah, the UAW has taken over everything.
[02:18:59.383 --> 02:19:06.708]  The UAW has given up guaranteed health care for shares of stock in Chrysler and General Motors that are going to be worthless.
[02:19:07.208 --> 02:19:09.069]  So the risk has been shifted to them.
[02:19:09.569 --> 02:19:15.473]  And as far as I understand, a $6 billion payment is immediately made to JPMorgan Chase and Citibank.
[02:19:15.493 --> 02:19:16.433]  So they are made whole.
[02:19:16.753 --> 02:19:17.934]  They get off with a whole coat.
[02:19:18.254 --> 02:19:20.475]  And then they privatize the risk.
[02:19:20.495 --> 02:19:27.618]  They take taxpayer money, put it into stocks, float it out there, and then when it goes down the tubes, it doesn't matter, it just goes into thin air.
[02:19:27.838 --> 02:19:30.659]  But like you said, JPMorgan Chase, they got the cash up front.
[02:19:31.479 --> 02:19:35.041]  And if you want to look at the real excesses, this is typical, right?
[02:19:35.061 --> 02:19:38.402]  We have the AIG payments from the TARP, right?
[02:19:38.422 --> 02:19:40.063]  From the bailout, the bailout.
[02:19:40.523 --> 02:19:42.443]  So the TARP gave AIG $180 or $200 billion.
[02:19:42.463 --> 02:19:42.904]  Who got that money?
[02:19:46.585 --> 02:19:49.908]  Barclays Bank of Great Britain, $10 billion, $15 billion.
[02:19:50.228 --> 02:19:52.630]  Deutsche Bank of Germany, $10 to $15 billion.
[02:19:53.170 --> 02:19:56.133]  Societe Generale of France, $10 to $15 billion.
[02:19:56.633 --> 02:20:02.037]  Union Bank of Switzerland, perhaps the most bankrupt of all the big zombie banks, another $10 to $15 billion.
[02:20:02.478 --> 02:20:04.319]  And Goldman Sachs, $10 to $15 billion.
[02:20:04.479 --> 02:20:05.440]  And AIG, $180 billion.
[02:20:06.881 --> 02:20:07.041]  Right.
[02:20:07.061 --> 02:20:10.063]  Well, the money was conduited through AIG to them.
[02:20:10.383 --> 02:20:19.507]  And the centerpiece, of course, is this London hedge fund of AIG, which issued $3 trillion of derivatives, more than the gross national product of France.
[02:20:19.527 --> 02:20:21.028]  So that gives you precisely the key.
[02:20:21.388 --> 02:20:27.871]  If you got burned by a hedge fund selling derivatives, your next step is to outlaw hedge funds and to outlaw derivatives.
[02:20:28.371 --> 02:20:33.915]  We have these characters around Obama now talking about their plan to regulate derivatives.
[02:20:34.236 --> 02:20:37.958]  My plan to regulate derivatives is a shredder and a delete button.
[02:20:37.978 --> 02:20:39.199]  In other words, you get rid of them.
[02:20:39.359 --> 02:20:40.120]  You wipe them out.
[02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:43.563]  Not only are they worthless, they're black hole singularities.
[02:20:43.663 --> 02:20:44.663]  I mean, like you said, worthless.
[02:20:44.683 --> 02:20:45.964]  They have negative value.
[02:20:46.004 --> 02:20:46.745]  Negative value.
[02:20:46.785 --> 02:20:47.606]  The Rasputnik.
[02:20:47.866 --> 02:20:51.168]  You gotta pay the mafia garbage men to come and take them away.
[02:20:52.509 --> 02:20:53.170]  Unbelievable.
[02:20:53.350 --> 02:20:55.732]  Well, Webster, we're about to break a long segment coming up.
[02:20:56.738 --> 02:20:58.478]  But I've got to get into this with you.
[02:20:58.518 --> 02:21:00.339]  I know you're giving us solutions, and I agree with many of them.
[02:21:00.919 --> 02:21:02.460]  Let's talk about what is going to happen.
[02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:04.320]  They're clearly not going to change course.
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:05.300]  They're criminal.
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:06.081]  They're all in.
[02:21:06.101 --> 02:21:06.981]  They're going for broke.
[02:21:07.541 --> 02:21:09.161]  All their treasure is staked on this.
[02:21:09.201 --> 02:21:10.082]  Their blood, their name.
[02:21:10.382 --> 02:21:11.462]  They're going all out.
[02:21:11.922 --> 02:21:15.503]  The youth corps are marching on TV in red and black uniforms now.
[02:21:15.523 --> 02:21:16.763]  I don't know if you've seen this.
[02:21:17.183 --> 02:21:18.724]  I mean, we're now entering some type of
[02:21:20.367 --> 02:21:30.251]  Strangelove-ian, Brave New World mixed with Twilight Zone Vortex, where I expect to see floating pink panthers any moment.
[02:21:30.631 --> 02:21:32.471]  So I want flying pigs here.
[02:21:32.872 --> 02:21:33.652]  I want to go over
[02:21:34.758 --> 02:21:43.003]  The worst case scenario, which it appears it is, as we go into hyper-stag inflation, and they don't do what should be done, what is going to happen?
[02:21:43.423 --> 02:21:46.685]  Because I think at this point, things are going to go down the tubes.
[02:21:47.425 --> 02:21:48.726]  How do we salvage something?
[02:21:49.106 --> 02:21:50.247]  Webster Tarpley, stay with us.
[02:21:51.187 --> 02:21:52.088]  We're on the march.
[02:21:52.568 --> 02:21:54.189]  The empire's on the run.
[02:21:55.109 --> 02:21:57.791]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:11.387]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:22:11.867 --> 02:22:12.928]  Garden in a Can!
[02:22:13.288 --> 02:22:16.851]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[02:22:17.431 --> 02:22:19.192]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[02:22:19.452 --> 02:22:21.734]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[02:22:22.194 --> 02:22:31.261]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[02:22:31.881 --> 02:22:32.882]  Garden in a can.
[02:22:33.302 --> 02:22:34.163]  It's that simple.
[02:22:34.503 --> 02:22:34.803]  Fresh.
[02:22:35.204 --> 02:22:35.604]  Healthy.

[02:22:54.167 --> 02:22:54.868]  A new world order.
[02:22:54.908 --> 02:22:58.331]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:23:09.688 --> 02:23:11.831]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:23:12.512 --> 02:23:14.755]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:23:15.295 --> 02:23:17.758]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:23:18.479 --> 02:23:25.808]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:23:28.829 --> 02:23:33.772]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:23:40.717 --> 02:23:41.678]  Most people have no idea.
[02:23:41.698 --> 02:23:42.638]  They're not after money.
[02:23:42.658 --> 02:23:43.739]  They have all the money they need.
[02:23:43.939 --> 02:23:44.660]  They're after power.
[02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:45.780]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:24:03.292 --> 02:24:05.934]  We're way beyond a question of if and when it's upon us.
[02:24:06.374 --> 02:24:10.897]  When you can't safely touch anything and a cough or sneeze can shut down your school or business.
[02:24:11.278 --> 02:24:18.383]  How would you or could you disinfect a school bus, office, locker room, place of worship or your entire home and do it in just minutes?

[02:24:47.372 --> 02:24:48.874]  You can't buy Hazurid in stores.

[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:11.964]  Alright, Webster, in the time we got with you, I want to jam in some calls as well.
[02:25:11.984 --> 02:25:14.226]  I gotta have you back up.
[02:25:15.327 --> 02:25:16.128]  Time just flies.
[02:25:16.148 --> 02:25:17.170]  I only jump a couple hours.
[02:25:17.230 --> 02:25:18.531]  Plus, I know you just finished two books.
[02:25:22.495 --> 02:25:26.100]  One on the roots of this cartel and one on their modern activities.
[02:25:27.841 --> 02:25:28.002]  But...
[02:25:29.878 --> 02:25:45.310]  As all this deteriorates faster and faster, and they still prance around saying globalism is the answer, when clearly their system of globalization engineered all of this, whether by hook or by crook, they're the progenitors of the problem that we're under.
[02:25:46.351 --> 02:25:51.655]  And then we have Geithner running around saying, don't worry, the dollar's safe, and the Chinese laugh at him.
[02:25:51.675 --> 02:25:52.776]  That's in the news.
[02:25:52.856 --> 02:25:55.718]  And then the dollar starts plunging even further.
[02:25:58.346 --> 02:25:59.507]  I tend to agree with you.
[02:25:59.527 --> 02:26:03.330]  I mean, I believe they engineered it because they have their own IMF World Bank documents, but it's kind of like them.
[02:26:04.431 --> 02:26:08.255]  Delusional liars tend to start believing their own bull, their own horse crap.
[02:26:08.635 --> 02:26:14.581]  And I really think they've lost control and these psychopathic thieves have endangered the entire shooting match.
[02:26:15.737 --> 02:26:16.497]  I think that's true.
[02:26:17.037 --> 02:26:23.440]  I think we're headed probably towards some kind of acute turn of this crisis.
[02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:28.502]  In other words, we've been living in this fool's paradise with a mugs rally, a sucker rally going on in Wall Street.
[02:26:28.902 --> 02:26:31.743]  But notice, the state of California is collapsing.
[02:26:31.803 --> 02:26:33.023]  General Motors is bankrupt.
[02:26:33.063 --> 02:26:34.164]  Chrysler is bankrupt.
[02:26:34.704 --> 02:26:38.065]  The Toyota car sales are down 40% in the most recent month.
[02:26:39.066 --> 02:26:42.352]  Unemployment continues to be very, very high.
[02:26:42.592 --> 02:26:45.718]  It's about half a million jobs lost per month, every month.
[02:26:46.439 --> 02:26:47.841]  So that's going to be a disaster.
[02:26:47.861 --> 02:26:50.887]  Now the question is, when do you reach the breaking point on Obama?
[02:26:52.003 --> 02:27:03.286]  Historically speaking, the previous case of the 100% Wall Street Puppet President, owned by the Trilateral Commission and Brzezinski and Rockefellers and so forth, was of course Carter.
[02:27:03.767 --> 02:27:14.730]  Carter reached his peak right about now, so to speak, the end of April, beginning of May, mid-May 1977, and after that Carter began to slide into a
[02:27:15.650 --> 02:27:19.912]  Into a decline, and I think that there are signs that that's happening with with Obama.
[02:27:19.972 --> 02:27:39.359]  The left liberals in particular, if you happen to see this campaign for America's future, this Borosage, Kushner, Vanden Heuvel group, the left liberals, sort of the limousine liberal, Learjet liberal types, right, merging into parts of the Obama administration, they're very uncomfortable with this idea of the 13 trillion going to Wall Street,
[02:27:39.859 --> 02:27:43.421]  And a few hundred billion, the crumbs, going to the rest of us.
[02:27:43.441 --> 02:27:44.841]  So I think there's a big problem there.
[02:27:45.141 --> 02:27:49.363]  The question is, if you're going to attack Obama, you've got to attack him from the left.
[02:27:49.403 --> 02:27:50.283]  This is the big thing.
[02:27:50.924 --> 02:27:51.684]  Look at Obama.
[02:27:51.744 --> 02:27:55.786]  He loves to play himself off against Limbaugh, against Newt Gingrich.
[02:27:55.806 --> 02:27:57.026]  No, their own memos say that.
[02:27:57.066 --> 02:28:01.208]  They say, we want to make this about running for office against Limbaugh.
[02:28:01.228 --> 02:28:02.809]  Limbaugh isn't running Jack's squad.
[02:28:03.069 --> 02:28:07.871]  Limbaugh loves the attention, but he knows they're using him as a distraction.
[02:28:08.251 --> 02:28:10.412]  And of course, there's an egomaniac, he can't get enough of it.
[02:28:10.893 --> 02:28:14.095]  The critique that really hurts Obama is a left-wing critique.
[02:28:14.135 --> 02:28:25.982]  Now, you've got to develop some idea of an alternative policy, and it can't be, you know, cut the budget and let everything liquidate into a general bankruptcy, because that's just going to kill people.
[02:28:26.022 --> 02:28:33.867]  No, they've already hyper-inflated things to the point we need to arrest the bankers and direct all this fiat stuff into real industry so we get something.
[02:28:34.295 --> 02:28:39.322]  Let me just say, one sign of life, and I'm surprised by this, but you know Michael Moore, right?
[02:28:39.382 --> 02:28:42.146]  Michael Moore, he's been around for a while, people know him.
[02:28:43.142 --> 02:28:48.725]  If you look at his essay on General Motors, you will see that there are signs of life there.
[02:28:48.745 --> 02:28:51.646]  In other words, it's tinged with this gangrene economy stuff.
[02:28:51.686 --> 02:28:55.088]  It's tinged with this alternative energy claptrap.
[02:28:55.608 --> 02:29:05.153]  But what he says is, you've got to go back to the 1942 conversion of General Motors to war production, and then the reconversion in 1945-46 back into civilian production.
[02:29:07.974 --> 02:29:10.897]  And what could you reconvert those factories to do, right?
[02:29:10.917 --> 02:29:19.866]  Because you've got unemployed workers, 14 more General Motors factories closing, dozens of factories now idle, hundreds of thousands of unemployed autoworkers.
[02:29:20.106 --> 02:29:20.827]  What could you build?
[02:29:20.907 --> 02:29:23.230]  And he says, well, you could build bullet trains.
[02:29:23.310 --> 02:29:27.474]  Now, bullet trains would be, you know, the Japanese trains, but of course they're obsolete now.
[02:29:27.774 --> 02:29:28.695]  We want maglev.
[02:29:28.735 --> 02:29:37.742]  We want magnetic levitation railways where you go from Los Angeles to New York in three hours in a railcar.
[02:29:37.762 --> 02:29:52.273]  Instead they're going to build cruddy local slow trains to nowhere with people so poor they can't even afford to get on them instead of super trains to cities where you say, oh, I'm going to shoot down to Dallas on the hour train instead of four hours in a car.
[02:29:52.573 --> 02:29:53.694]  But they won't do it, man.
[02:29:53.734 --> 02:29:55.395]  They will not do it because it's a good idea.
[02:29:55.435 --> 02:29:55.956]  We're good to go.
[02:30:10.468 --> 02:30:11.669]  Let's back that up.
[02:30:11.829 --> 02:30:12.469]  Let's back that up.
[02:30:12.489 --> 02:30:18.811]  You can't build windmills because for the amount of power they generate and their cost, there's not a way to transfer the power without power loss.
[02:30:18.851 --> 02:30:21.212]  For those that don't know, power lines lose power.
[02:30:21.612 --> 02:30:29.615]  So the substations to hold that power are too cost prohibitive from the wind centers of the country to deliver it to major megacities.
[02:30:29.935 --> 02:30:33.256]  Now, wind is good in a localized small town setting.
[02:30:34.045 --> 02:30:42.193]  Well, it can be used for specialties when there's no other alternative, but generally speaking, you're going to put more energy into the windmill than you're ever going to get out of it.
[02:30:42.313 --> 02:30:48.899]  So there are some places where you need that kind of thing, but as a base load approach to an industrial economy, it's a bad joke.
[02:30:48.959 --> 02:30:55.104]  It's not a primary driver, but listen, before we get out of time now, I know you want to get into solutions, Webster, but I think people need to understand what's going to happen
[02:30:55.805 --> 02:30:57.686]  Because clearly none of these are being implemented.
[02:30:57.706 --> 02:31:00.969]  And even if people don't agree with your solutions, they've got their own.
[02:31:01.289 --> 02:31:04.011]  Nothing but everything for Wall Street into the black hole.
[02:31:04.111 --> 02:31:10.115]  Everything, clearly, Pentagon, Northcom standing by to deliver us directly into the maw.
[02:31:11.256 --> 02:31:12.217]  And we've got Zoellick
[02:31:13.997 --> 02:31:42.564]  uh... warns stimulus sugar high won't stem unemployment so what's this double speak top neocon world bank president robert zoellick literally an israeli agent publicly warns policy makers that fiscal stimulus plans are insufficient to turn around the real economy and rising joblessness threatens to set up political unrest across the globe and then he goes on so so so why are they making statements about political unrest knowing it's going to happen when they've engineered the policies knowing it would do that
[02:31:43.206 --> 02:31:45.308]  Well, there has been a lot of political unrest.
[02:31:45.328 --> 02:31:49.551]  There's been a big ferment in the trade union movement in Europe.
[02:31:49.571 --> 02:31:53.214]  There have been various kinds of riots and things like this around the world.
[02:31:53.595 --> 02:31:56.037]  And that's why I'm saying the program is absolutely critical.
[02:31:56.337 --> 02:32:00.941]  You can get a mass movement going under these circumstances, but if the Democratic Party collapses,
[02:32:01.556 --> 02:32:04.900]  You've got to have an actual program to get out of the depression.
[02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:12.228]  I would say that's the golden question right now, and it's the most precious wisdom in the world is, how do you actually get out of a depression?
[02:32:12.529 --> 02:32:20.158]  And I believe I know, and that's what I put into this book, Surviving the Cataclysm, which people can get from Progressive Press, and then I hope soon from you.
[02:32:21.619 --> 02:32:24.882]  Yeah, folks, just Google, surviving the cataclysm was for Griffin Tartley.
[02:32:24.902 --> 02:32:26.483]  Look, look, look, resistance, okay?
[02:32:26.503 --> 02:32:27.724]  A couple of other things going around.
[02:32:28.284 --> 02:32:32.347]  The French government, of all people, the French government has now proposed a Tobin tax.
[02:32:32.848 --> 02:32:34.129]  The securities transfer tax.
[02:32:34.149 --> 02:32:40.353]  In other words, something like a 1% sales tax on Wall Street bankers as they do their trillions of dollars.
[02:32:40.453 --> 02:32:44.757]  I only support that if it's implemented by the nations, not by the very bankers themselves.
[02:32:45.988 --> 02:32:48.170]  Well, it's implemented against the bankers themselves.
[02:32:48.190 --> 02:32:49.390]  They're the ones who pay it.
[02:32:49.430 --> 02:32:50.471]  No, but you understand the U.N.
[02:32:50.571 --> 02:32:55.594]  and the bankers have been proposing a Tobin, but on our money transfers, to bring in a global model.
[02:32:55.654 --> 02:32:56.355]  On derivatives.
[02:32:57.255 --> 02:32:58.816]  On the rest of their speculation.
[02:32:59.096 --> 02:33:03.339]  Another example, the banks have now bid the price of oil up to $67-$68.
[02:33:03.379 --> 02:33:04.520]  Now, remember who this is.
[02:33:06.781 --> 02:33:10.785]  This is Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and they operate through the London I.C.E.
[02:33:10.845 --> 02:33:11.225]  Exchange.
[02:33:11.245 --> 02:33:11.745]  You can see it.
[02:33:11.785 --> 02:33:12.666]  They did it last year.
[02:33:13.066 --> 02:33:13.687]  They got it up to $150, $160.
[02:33:14.288 --> 02:33:17.991]  They're trying to do it again.
[02:33:18.671 --> 02:33:19.692]  So that's their thanks.
[02:33:19.772 --> 02:33:21.334]  You bailed them out with the TARP.
[02:33:21.394 --> 02:33:25.417]  Your tax money went to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are now banks.
[02:33:25.797 --> 02:33:27.019]  But of course, they're zombie banks.
[02:33:27.079 --> 02:33:30.001]  The only thing they do is derivatives and proprietary trading.
[02:33:30.021 --> 02:33:33.124]  And now they're going to jack up energy so they all make tens of billions.
[02:33:33.444 --> 02:33:40.069]  They've got to drive the price of gasoline and oil up to make some of these crazy windmills look more plausible.
[02:33:40.489 --> 02:33:41.430]  So that's what they're doing.
[02:33:42.151 --> 02:33:46.574]  By the middle of last summer, you were paying $1 for every gallon of gas.
[02:33:47.214 --> 02:33:50.297]  $1 went to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley alone.
[02:33:50.877 --> 02:33:55.018]  So, if you don't like that, what you gotta do is take measures to stop speculation.
[02:33:55.038 --> 02:34:04.701]  100% margin requirements, position limits, and special status for speculators, which is inferior to the status of users and hedgers.
[02:34:04.761 --> 02:34:07.822]  Now, the other aspect of it is the political resistance.
[02:34:07.862 --> 02:34:12.564]  I don't know if you've talked about Sri Lanka, but this seems to me to be very, very, very interesting.
[02:34:13.044 --> 02:34:17.810]  The US and the British, over decades, fomented this Tamil Tiger revolt.
[02:34:17.850 --> 02:34:20.573]  These are terrorist butchers of the worst kind, right?
[02:34:20.893 --> 02:34:23.316]  Suicide bombers, female suicide bombers.
[02:34:23.757 --> 02:34:25.659]  They pioneered all this stuff.
[02:34:26.286 --> 02:34:30.549]  The question now is, the Indian Ocean, as the Chinese lifeline, right?
[02:34:30.569 --> 02:34:36.073]  The Chinese need to get oil from the Persian Gulf, oil from Sudan, raw materials from Africa.
[02:34:36.113 --> 02:34:40.717]  So the Indian Ocean, the arc of crisis, in Brzezinski's terms, is now a key place.
[02:34:41.137 --> 02:34:47.181]  In the middle of this, you had this terrorist army, sponsored by the US and the British, the Liberation Tigers.
[02:34:47.802 --> 02:34:49.383]  And they have now been annihilated.
[02:34:49.463 --> 02:34:53.606]  Their chief, this guy Prabhakaran, has been liquidated.
[02:34:54.224 --> 02:34:57.286]  And what you saw, a very interesting epiphany, right?
[02:34:57.326 --> 02:34:59.527]  The moment where you really see what's what in the world.
[02:35:00.127 --> 02:35:04.049]  As the Sri Lankan army closes in on these awful, awful terrorists.
[02:35:04.713 --> 02:35:18.228]  The British Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, and the French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, come forward and say, oh no, this is terrible, it's a humanitarian catastrophe, we've got to have a ceasefire.
[02:35:18.328 --> 02:35:24.635]  Ceasefire means that the Tamil Tigers escape and live to come back and kill and have more suicide bombers another day.
[02:35:24.875 --> 02:35:30.818]  Well that's just like using Al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs, and then on this airplane in Iran they find the bomb.
[02:35:31.139 --> 02:35:32.740]  Iran's on record saying the U.S.
[02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:34.941]  is using Al-Qaeda to attack them.
[02:35:34.961 --> 02:35:45.647]  The White House admits under Bush and Obama they're using Sunnis to destabilize Iran, and then the news has the nerve to say that Shiite Iran is Al-Qaeda.
[02:35:46.007 --> 02:35:47.088]  I mean, how dumb!
[02:35:47.388 --> 02:35:49.909]  Don't people know that Al-Qaeda is the U.S.
[02:35:49.949 --> 02:35:50.630]  British government?
[02:35:51.550 --> 02:35:59.632]  Well, the KLA of Kosovo that Biden has just been visiting, and the Tamil Tigers, and the... But I mean, that's how ridiculous it is!
[02:35:59.792 --> 02:36:14.456]  On record, the White House puts out press releases saying, we got four Sunni groups attacking Iran, they're blowing up mosques, trying to blow up airplanes, bombing things, and then they got the nerve to say on the news, look, Al-Qaeda is hitting Iran, we've got to stop Al-Qaeda.
[02:36:14.696 --> 02:36:17.337]  I mean, how dumb do these people think the population is?
[02:36:17.357 --> 02:36:19.258]  Specifically, Chundula, right?
[02:36:19.278 --> 02:36:20.118]  The Balochistan...
[02:36:21.959 --> 02:36:28.463]  Now, what the Sri Lankans have done is going to be imitated, and I think the Pakistanis have gotten the idea.
[02:36:28.983 --> 02:36:31.905]  Now, the reason that Obama wants to... I'm going to stop you again.
[02:36:31.945 --> 02:36:41.711]  Pakistan president goes on and says, we're with Al-Qaeda, you created Al-Qaeda, you're using the Taliban to isolate our cities, you're overthrowing us with your Al-Qaeda.
[02:36:41.951 --> 02:36:43.412]  And boy, they didn't like that, did they?
[02:36:44.493 --> 02:36:59.803]  But the answer is now, what the Pakistani Army seems to have done is to say, what the Sri Lankans have done, we can do, and that is to say, take the conventional Pakistani Army, go into the Swat Valley, and basically wipe out the Taliban, which are largely people now who have been recruited
[02:37:00.223 --> 02:37:06.445]  By the Indians and by the CIA in Afghanistan and then sent into Pakistan to overthrow the government.
[02:37:06.745 --> 02:37:08.966]  Those people seem to have been pretty much mowed down.
[02:37:09.026 --> 02:37:17.749]  So about 1,500 so-called Taliban, in other words CIA secret army types, have been wiped out in the Swat Valley.
[02:37:18.149 --> 02:37:20.090]  Minimal losses for the Pakistani army.
[02:37:20.130 --> 02:37:21.150]  The goal being
[02:37:21.690 --> 02:37:32.417]  That if you can kick the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda out of your country, then Obama will no longer have the pretext to send these killer drones to destroy civilian targets.
[02:37:51.810 --> 02:37:53.751]  I mean, this is on record!
[02:37:54.091 --> 02:38:03.414]  But now, the difference now, there is something new, that under Chinese auspices, and this is simply what's going on, like it or not, they've figured some of this stuff out.
[02:38:03.854 --> 02:38:05.514]  It's called the String of Pearls, right?
[02:38:05.554 --> 02:38:15.958]  The Chinese say, well, we need to have Thailand, Burma, Myanmar, we need Bangladesh, we need Sri Lanka, we need the Seychelles, the Comoros, we need to get over to Sudan and Zimbabwe.
[02:38:16.318 --> 02:38:19.979]  These are your Chinese allies, and this is what Brzezinski and Obama
[02:38:20.679 --> 02:38:23.342]  And the Clinton State Department are attacking.
[02:38:23.862 --> 02:38:29.448]  So, there's got then to be a resistance, and the Chinese are basically showing them how to do it.
[02:38:29.488 --> 02:38:40.658]  With Chinese help, the Sri Lankans have wiped out these Tamil Tigers, and it may well be that with Chinese help, the Pakistanis are going to liberate themselves of the presence of these Taliban and al-Qaeda.
[02:38:40.678 --> 02:38:41.619]  But I gotta shift gears.
[02:38:41.679 --> 02:38:43.461]  It's a very promising sign in the world.
[02:38:43.521 --> 02:38:45.423]  I think highly interesting people should know about it.
[02:38:45.543 --> 02:38:52.327]  Well, I'm sure we've got to have you up longer in the near future to really let you run all this, because you're such an expert on it all, and we really appreciate your time.
[02:38:52.347 --> 02:39:03.894]  But going back here, but at the same time, China is Siamese twins here with the United States and the West, owning the majority of our debt, and are they going to continue to hold the dollar?
[02:39:04.234 --> 02:39:14.961]  How do you see things unfolding versus... There's a big debate in China now, because it is, of course, crazy for a developing country that needs to buy capital goods
[02:39:15.660 --> 02:39:20.668]  To hold large amounts of dollars, paper dollars, in the form of these treasury bonds.
[02:39:21.723 --> 02:39:27.689]  The Chinese leadership, they're really not as clever as they thought they were.
[02:39:27.709 --> 02:39:31.913]  They seem to believe in money, money in terms of paper money, dollars.
[02:39:31.993 --> 02:39:34.476]  Well, these are just green pieces of paper.
[02:39:34.836 --> 02:39:41.923]  If you get some dollars, what you damn well better do with them is go and buy some capital goods, go and buy steel mills, go and buy locomotives.
[02:39:41.943 --> 02:39:43.604]  Well, they're starting to do that though.
[02:39:43.844 --> 02:39:45.346]  China's moving into copper and gold.
[02:39:45.486 --> 02:39:46.607]  They're starting to do it.
[02:39:46.647 --> 02:40:06.201]  But the gales of laughter for tiny Tim Geithner, the tax cheat, the turbo tax man, when he went to Beijing University and they basically got caught him into non-existence, when he said, I want you to know, I want you to know in the worst way that your investments in U.S.
[02:40:06.241 --> 02:40:09.544]  Treasury bonds are safe and sound, and they just all started laughing.
[02:40:10.163 --> 02:40:14.407]  And I think that's a turning point in world history because it's just untenable.
[02:40:15.207 --> 02:40:23.234]  Because they know a slime bag corporate thief that's destroyed America, a little spider is in there, and it's all just a big joke to them.
[02:40:23.254 --> 02:40:25.135]  They're trying to prop up their biggest market.
[02:40:25.596 --> 02:40:29.839]  But I mean, I think the decision has been made globally that it's the end.
[02:40:30.339 --> 02:40:39.006]  And I guess we'll just be ruled by a bunch of Geithners and Summers and Rubin running around with military
[02:40:39.949 --> 02:40:43.511]  In the time we've got, Webster, then how do you see this unraveling?
[02:40:43.611 --> 02:40:52.815]  And now, have you seen the TV ads that are running nationally with people in black and red uniforms marching, and they're openly announcing that they're going to be on the streets and are on the streets?
[02:40:53.275 --> 02:40:55.196]  I mean, it's actually happening, Webster.
[02:40:55.216 --> 02:40:59.698]  It's one thing to say we think it's coming, but I mean, we are descending into hell here.
[02:41:00.679 --> 02:41:06.862]  Yeah, it's obviously a bad scene, and there are these quasi-fascist or fascist militias
[02:41:07.483 --> 02:41:07.863]  Coming up.
[02:41:08.043 --> 02:41:10.584]  But I urge people, don't take yourself out of the equation.
[02:41:10.945 --> 02:41:13.746]  This whole regime is extremely vulnerable right now.
[02:41:14.086 --> 02:41:20.529]  The big problem is, if you go forward and say, you know, we don't like Obama, but we want the free market, that's a loser.
[02:41:20.989 --> 02:41:22.930]  It's just, it's not going anywhere.
[02:41:22.970 --> 02:41:32.614]  Yeah, they're going to have us argue between left and right, when this has nothing to do with it, and a phony right-wing thing versus a left-wing thing, and then meanwhile, it just goes off the edge of a cliff.
[02:41:33.034 --> 02:41:34.315]  But if you get out there and say,
[02:41:35.254 --> 02:41:46.068]  Seize General Motors and reconvert it to produce tractors, nuclear reactors, maglev rail, modern capital goods that can be sold in the third world.
[02:41:46.128 --> 02:41:50.113]  But the globalists don't want to build up the third world.
[02:41:50.333 --> 02:41:54.018]  They want to neutralize them from industry so that they can be controlled.
[02:41:54.458 --> 02:41:54.938]  Absolutely.
[02:41:54.978 --> 02:41:55.919]  So you've got to counter that.
[02:41:56.219 --> 02:41:57.700]  So you counter them in every way.
[02:41:57.760 --> 02:41:59.601]  Counter them nationally and internationally.
[02:42:00.061 --> 02:42:02.382]  So I think it's time to organize.
[02:42:02.402 --> 02:42:10.787]  In other words, I think the Obama deception, your work, and other things have come together now, especially the betrayals of this regime.
[02:42:11.107 --> 02:42:12.668]  We have this guy called Ted Roll.
[02:42:12.988 --> 02:42:13.768]  He's an interesting guy.
[02:42:13.788 --> 02:42:14.829]  I don't know if you saw this, right?
[02:42:14.849 --> 02:42:16.870]  The Illinois State Journal Register.
[02:42:17.490 --> 02:42:18.370]  I didn't see it.
[02:42:18.390 --> 02:42:18.851]  Who was this?
[02:42:34.736 --> 02:42:39.020]  Ted Rall, R-A-L-L, the Illinois State Journal Register.
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:41.542]  He's actually, he's an interesting person, the maverick.
[02:42:41.602 --> 02:42:45.906]  He was one of the first people to call for the impeachment of Bush.
[02:42:45.966 --> 02:42:47.947]  Stay there, stay there, Webster.
[02:42:47.967 --> 02:42:48.468]  Final segment.
[02:42:48.808 --> 02:42:51.631]  I was going to take calls, we took a lot earlier, but I just am out of time.
[02:42:51.671 --> 02:42:53.192]  Julio and Chris and Matthew and Dave and Rick.
[02:42:53.452 --> 02:42:54.633]  Call back tomorrow, you'll be there first.
[02:42:54.653 --> 02:42:59.978]  We're going to come back in the final segment, because I want to talk about what they're saying the solution is.
[02:43:01.124 --> 02:43:08.109]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:43:08.329 --> 02:43:12.632]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:43:12.892 --> 02:43:17.995]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[02:43:18.496 --> 02:43:25.600]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:43:26.041 --> 02:43:30.944]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[02:43:31.404 --> 02:43:36.868]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:43:37.248 --> 02:43:42.752]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[02:43:43.052 --> 02:43:48.775]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[02:43:48.996 --> 02:43:51.517]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.

[02:44:01.562 --> 02:44:06.867]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:44:07.367 --> 02:44:14.353]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:44:14.944 --> 02:44:21.148]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:44:21.549 --> 02:44:23.370]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:44:23.510 --> 02:44:25.932]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:44:26.012 --> 02:44:36.959]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:44:37.589 --> 02:44:40.651]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[02:44:41.111 --> 02:44:47.495]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:44:48.016 --> 02:44:55.821]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today, at InfoWars.com, or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:44:56.281 --> 02:44:57.442]  The Obama Deception.
[02:44:57.842 --> 02:44:59.123]  The people strike back.
[02:45:02.285 --> 02:45:04.226]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck, E-Food's
[02:45:08.351 --> 02:45:08.791]  We're good to go!
[02:45:32.264 --> 02:45:32.684]  I think so.
[02:46:03.194 --> 02:46:06.056]  All right, going back to Tarbley in the final few minutes here in just a moment.
[02:46:06.076 --> 02:46:11.879]  I want to first tell you about our final sponsor of the day, making this hour possible, New Silver Solution.
[02:46:12.419 --> 02:46:16.842]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?

[02:46:43.152 --> 02:46:44.854]  Keep the area sanitized for hours.
[02:46:44.874 --> 02:46:46.075]  They have a lot of different products.
[02:46:46.455 --> 02:46:51.840]  The new silver solution is highly effective, potent, nanoparticle solution that is lethal to bacteria, yeast, and viruses.

[02:47:13.740 --> 02:47:15.142]  Okay, Webster, look, here's the deal.
[02:47:15.902 --> 02:47:16.823]  You've got your solutions.
[02:47:16.863 --> 02:47:17.664]  I agree with a lot of it.
[02:47:18.264 --> 02:47:19.646]  We're not in control of things.
[02:47:19.726 --> 02:47:21.387]  The people don't want what the bankers are doing.
[02:47:21.407 --> 02:47:22.428]  They want what you're saying.
[02:47:22.728 --> 02:47:23.349]  Common sense.
[02:47:23.389 --> 02:47:24.090]  It's not happening.
[02:47:24.730 --> 02:47:30.295]  Bloomberg saying how dare the American people not love what's happening with GM.
[02:47:30.816 --> 02:47:32.397]  As if we don't care.
[02:47:32.437 --> 02:47:33.498]  As if we haven't been raped enough.
[02:47:33.859 --> 02:47:39.284]  That's being used as a distraction of the tens of trillions that have been sucked out right to the bankers.
[02:47:39.904 --> 02:47:51.910]  But they're having a fake solution that is carbon taxes, shutting down most of the industry, as Pelosi said in China, categorizing and registering everything we do, carbon credit, ration cards.
[02:47:52.550 --> 02:48:09.179]  I don't think the public realizes that not only are they going to bankrupt things, their new economy is this debt economy by design to bring in neo-feudalism and serfdom that you cover in the Obama deception so eloquently that I hope folks will get at InfoWars.com and show to people quickly.
[02:48:09.739 --> 02:48:18.263]  So in closing, how do we, we have to not just have solutions, we have to discredit their power grab of the whole economy that's left.
[02:48:18.303 --> 02:48:21.204]  I mean, there's no way to say this wasn't designed.
[02:48:21.244 --> 02:48:23.565]  Everything they're doing is designed to criminally consolidate.
[02:48:24.445 --> 02:48:32.208]  Well, we're all looking forward to the next product coming out of your shop there, if it's July 4th or thereabouts.
[02:48:33.069 --> 02:48:36.830]  And there may be possibly ways to regroup further.
[02:48:36.890 --> 02:48:38.531]  I mean, we might want to think about
[02:48:39.173 --> 02:48:47.722]  Some form of conferences, maybe in the late summer, early autumn, bring together various kinds of forces that are in resistance.
[02:48:47.802 --> 02:48:51.265]  I know Phil Berg... Yeah, I wonder if C-SPAN would put us back on.
[02:48:51.445 --> 02:48:51.986]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:48:52.106 --> 02:48:52.707]  It's possible.
[02:48:52.767 --> 02:48:55.530]  Phil Berg is continuing with his lawsuits.
[02:48:56.170 --> 02:49:03.934]  To expose Obama, he thought he had oral arguments in the Third Circuit in Philadelphia, but they've pushed him now into the autumn.
[02:49:03.974 --> 02:49:08.457]  But at a certain point, I think that the climate of opinion begins to change.
[02:49:08.497 --> 02:49:19.723]  In other words, I think Obama has now passed his peak, and I think people should therefore take heart and redouble their efforts and keep fighting the good fight, because Obama is now more vulnerable.
[02:49:20.923 --> 02:49:36.597]  The idea that these left liberals at their Campaign for America's Future conference are so uncomfortable about the fact that the guy is such an obvious Wall Street puppet, so subservient to Summers and all of these zombie bankers.
[02:49:36.957 --> 02:49:40.060]  I think that's beginning to crack this edifice.
[02:49:40.140 --> 02:49:46.466]  Well, I think what began to crack it was him saying no rights for detainees and the torture is going to continue and we're going to open new camps.
[02:49:46.566 --> 02:49:47.687]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:49:48.260 --> 02:49:51.743]  Right, but therefore, the big question is, economic program.
[02:49:52.144 --> 02:49:52.924]  Do you have one?
[02:49:53.265 --> 02:50:04.695]  In other words, can you criticize Obama in a way that makes it clear that you're not talking about having the depression work its full fury on the population, but you're actually proposing solutions that would work?
[02:50:05.075 --> 02:50:12.202]  And again, reconverting General Motors to make maglev trains, that's the idea that will, I think, take off and lead us into the future.
[02:50:13.462 --> 02:50:18.025]  Well, certainly that's better than just giving $14.8 trillion to a bunch of criminal bankers.
[02:50:18.465 --> 02:50:19.106]  Clawback!
[02:50:19.366 --> 02:50:19.846]  Clawback!
[02:50:20.006 --> 02:50:21.767]  Operation Clawback on the bankers!
[02:50:21.887 --> 02:50:23.949]  Well, we need to audit the Fed.
[02:50:23.989 --> 02:50:25.429]  That's going to expose how they're criminals.
[02:50:25.930 --> 02:50:29.472]  We need to get more state sovereignty to expose the central government.
[02:50:29.792 --> 02:50:31.473]  Webster Tarpley, great talking to you.
[02:50:31.493 --> 02:50:34.075]  Let me say bye to you as the show ends here in just a moment.
