[00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.694]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:11.156]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.897 --> 00:00:12.757]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:17.122]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:21.706]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.406 --> 00:00:40.767]  Alright my friends, welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Broadcast.
[00:00:42.248 --> 00:00:48.469]  Hard to believe another Monday is now upon us, the 16th day of August 2004.
[00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:59.871]  And of course the websites freshly updated for you are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:01:01.232 --> 00:01:09.679]  Paul Watson, who joins us at least once a week, will be joining us coming up here in about 20 minutes to go over a bunch of news and information that he thinks is important.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.904]  And then we have, well, an ultra-left wing group coming on.
[00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:18.506]  Some would say outright communists.
[00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:25.992]  But to talk about the FBI and the visits that some of these leftist organizations have been getting,
[00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:42.449]  And that should be an interesting interview in the next hour because I frankly don't like either group and I really think higher levels are controlled by the same people but you'll find out about that later in the next hour.
[00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:47.554]  Police tell journalists to leave or be shot.
[00:01:50.276 --> 00:02:08.828]  That's right, the Iraqi authorities ordered foreign journals to leave Najaf, I always pronounce that wrong, yesterday, threatening to arrest or even shoot reporters as US Marines and Iraqi government forces resume the fight against Shia militants in their capital city.
[00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:16.253]  And it says, the fighting in Najaf, the epicenter of the revolt led by the Shia militant cleric,
[00:02:17.768 --> 00:02:38.882]  caused protests from some delegates now very interesting because we have an entire archive on PrisonPlanet.com with the Reuters and BBC and Associated Press where our troops were ordered to kill journalists
[00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:43.314]  American, British journalists have been killed.
[00:02:43.814 --> 00:02:49.618]  Tanks have been ordered to aim into the Reuters floor of the Baghdad Hotel.
[00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.861]  This is admitted, and of course no one's getting in trouble for it.
[00:02:54.282 --> 00:03:01.887]  When some owl CIA individual supposedly grabs a reporter and cuts their head off, the world screams and freaks out and goes crazy.
[00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:03.568]  Which they should.
[00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:08.472]  But when our government murders journalists, it's a good thing.
[00:03:09.682 --> 00:03:15.926]  Well, I don't think it's a good thing, but, uh, police tell journalists to leave Najaf or be shot.
[00:03:17.026 --> 00:03:18.687]  Funny, that's out of the London Telegraph.
[00:03:19.148 --> 00:03:20.448]  Uh, here's another one.
[00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.210]  And this is out of the London Evening Standard.
[00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:28.353]  Gunmen threatened to kill British journalists unless there's a U.S.
[00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:30.914]  withdrawal from Najaf.
[00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:34.016]  Now, wait a minute.
[00:03:34.576 --> 00:03:38.639]  So, the LCIA is threatening to kill the journalists, and then the
[00:03:39.543 --> 00:03:42.885]  Open CIAdas are threatening to kill the journalist.
[00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:45.766]  So either way, you've got the same thing.
[00:03:46.207 --> 00:03:48.408]  Very, very suspicious.
[00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.610]  And we'll be talking about that.
[00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.631]  You're welcome to chime in on the subject.
[00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:56.392]  Some of the other news here.
[00:03:56.452 --> 00:04:05.797]  Porter Goss, in a TV interview, said that he wasn't qualified to be CIA Director, but now that interview is surfacing, we'll go over that.
[00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.678]  Also, Eurocorps,
[00:04:08.476 --> 00:04:12.757]  Takes command of peacekeepers in Afghanistan, the new European Army!
[00:04:13.338 --> 00:04:22.280]  Is trouncing and tromping around globe-trotting right now, not just the new NATO force that's not just in the North Atlantic, but all over the planet.
[00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:33.184]  And really scary articles here about citizen tattletale squads, a bunch of different articles out fighting terror and crime, and crime, and crime, see?
[00:04:34.344 --> 00:04:36.766]  Homeland Security certified terror and crime.
[00:04:36.886 --> 00:04:38.066]  Spy on your neighbor.
[00:04:38.146 --> 00:04:38.867]  Report them.
[00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:44.490]  Did they discipline the child in front of you?
[00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.531]  Do you smell marijuana?
[00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:47.652]  That's terrorism.
[00:04:47.972 --> 00:04:48.512]  I'm not kidding.
[00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:48.993]  Call.
[00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:49.693]  Call immediately.
[00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:50.434]  Homeland.
[00:04:50.474 --> 00:04:50.894]  Homeland.
[00:04:51.194 --> 00:04:52.395]  Keep the Homeland secure.
[00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:53.595]  Download everyone.
[00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:54.296]  Repeatedly.
[00:04:55.176 --> 00:04:56.377]  Hand in your firearms.
[00:04:56.477 --> 00:04:56.877]  Global.
[00:04:56.937 --> 00:04:57.298]  Global.
[00:04:57.358 --> 00:04:57.678]  Global.
[00:05:03.422 --> 00:05:08.906]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.326 --> 00:05:13.569]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:20.834]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.215 --> 00:05:27.319]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:28.680]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.961]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:34.142]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.442 --> 00:05:41.685]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:41.965 --> 00:05:45.346]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:02.022]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:02.202 --> 00:07:05.284]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:09.327]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:13.590]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.733]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:17.873 --> 00:07:19.715]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:19.855 --> 00:07:23.117]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:07:23.137 --> 00:07:24.318]  The medical bills!
[00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:27.921]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:31.125]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:31.305 --> 00:07:34.188]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.648 --> 00:07:40.775]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:45.098]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:46.880]  Order your video today.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.261]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[00:07:51.884 --> 00:07:52.144]  Big Brother.
[00:07:52.164 --> 00:07:52.484]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.627 --> 00:08:09.707]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.368 --> 00:08:11.208]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.948 --> 00:08:13.449]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:17.190]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.832]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:28.874]  Absolutely back in the saddle again!
[00:08:29.495 --> 00:08:32.276]  Monday, 16th day of August, 04,
[00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:58.648]  As we accelerate into the Republican National Convention, a giant police state programming session for the entire population, the campaign stops for the cousins, Kerry and Bush, the Skull and Bones buddies, are also little mini police state exercises with lots of police in black ski masks and armored vehicles shoving the public around the streets letting us know who the boss is.
[00:09:01.898 --> 00:09:05.520]  Oh, there is so much news here, just masses of it.
[00:09:07.241 --> 00:09:08.381]  Where should we start?
[00:09:10.282 --> 00:09:11.983]  I mean, where to begin?
[00:09:12.003 --> 00:09:28.991]  I would challenge all of you to begin at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and to just daily go look at all the news that we've got posted there on the site.
[00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:30.852]  It's just incredible.
[00:09:31.931 --> 00:09:45.668]  A lot of it we end up not getting to hear on the broadcast, but later we will talk about this Seattle Post-Intelligence article, and there's been lots of these out there mongering, on American Hiroshima is possible.
[00:09:46.736 --> 00:09:59.299]  If a 10 kiloton nuclear weapon, a midget even smaller than the one that destroyed Hiroshima, exploded in Times Square, the fireball would reach tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:12.923]  It would vaporize or destroy the Theater District, Madison Square Garden, the Empire States Building, Grand Central Terminal, and Carnegie Hall, along with me and my building.
[00:10:13.934 --> 00:10:14.915]  Is what the writer said.
[00:10:14.975 --> 00:10:20.719]  The blast would partly destroy a much larger area, including the United Nations.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.642]  On a weekday, some 500,000 people would be killed.
[00:10:25.183 --> 00:10:26.163]  Could this happen?
[00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:32.308]  Unfortunately, it could, and many experts believe that such an attack somewhere is likely.
[00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:40.855]  We'll get to more of this fear-mongering report, but I want to get into this first.
[00:10:43.889 --> 00:10:52.616]  And whereas we saw maybe one of these a month three years ago, we now see two or three of these a day.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.922]  This is out of the Fairmont Sentinel.
[00:11:00.183 --> 00:11:03.205]  Citizens on patrol introduced.
[00:11:03.506 --> 00:11:09.751]  Now remember last week we interviewed the Alabama Defense Forces
[00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:34.706]  We had this guy on and we linked over to their website, not just the photos that our listener took where we learned of all this at an Alabama football game a few months ago, a college football game, but photos of these guys at the shopping malls and on the street corners searching 8 year old girls with a hamburger and a cigarette in one hand and searching somebody's bag with the other.
[00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:41.050]  Training people how to live like slaves does absolutely nothing to keep us safe from the threat of Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:49.633]  And then I learned that all over the country this is happening, but it's the neighborhood watch, it's the high school children, the young people, it's everybody!
[00:11:52.793 --> 00:11:55.394]  And, of course, there's no real terrorists to fight.
[00:11:56.194 --> 00:12:02.556]  And so, every time you hear about a Homeland Security program, oh, a billion, too, for cameras in our city.
[00:12:03.351 --> 00:12:04.992]  To fight terror and crime.
[00:12:05.152 --> 00:12:11.375]  Oh, we put up 300 million dollars worth of cameras for the political meeting we had in town last month, but guess what?
[00:12:11.395 --> 00:12:14.136]  They're going to stay in place and spy on you and fight crime.
[00:12:15.256 --> 00:12:26.321]  Oh, we want you to go out and look for terrorists and criminals, or signs of criminality, or signs of dumping motor oil in your backyard, or is the neighbor spanking their child?
[00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:27.802]  Do you smell marijuana?
[00:12:27.842 --> 00:12:29.042]  Why, that aids terrorists.
[00:12:29.442 --> 00:12:30.483]  Call immediately.
[00:12:31.428 --> 00:12:38.593]  So, with the backdrop of 9-11 and things changed after 9-11, we've got to do things we never would have done before.
[00:12:38.693 --> 00:12:48.059]  Well then, why are you then, we never accepted a secret police Stasi America, Gestapo America to fight crime in the past, and it won't fight crime by the way.
[00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:49.840]  It'll actually increase it.
[00:12:50.461 --> 00:12:53.303]  The better the police state gets, the more crime and more drugs we have.
[00:12:53.343 --> 00:12:56.685]  But the point is, is that this whole backdrop, this whole atmosphere,
[00:12:59.255 --> 00:13:02.437]  of the war on terrorism is being focused upon the people.
[00:13:03.657 --> 00:13:05.599]  Citizens on patrol introduced.
[00:13:05.859 --> 00:13:12.822]  The national night out saw a good turnout Tuesday evening despite cool weather and last week's postponement.
[00:13:13.743 --> 00:13:26.250]  Along with a free meal of hot dogs and root beer floats, the night out was an opportunity to meet with Fairmont police officers, firefighters, and Gold Cross paramedics.
[00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:42.313]  The Fairmount Canine Unit gave demonstrations and there was a simulated drunk driving accident with a driver arrested and a passenger extracted from the vehicle by emergency personnel and airlifted by Mayo One.
[00:13:42.853 --> 00:13:45.513]  There was also a new group introduced to the public Tuesday.
[00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:51.095]  The Fairmount VFW has organized a group called Citizens on Patrol or COP.
[00:13:53.311 --> 00:13:59.536]  Serve their country in wars, and now they're serving their communities, said Fairmont Police Chief Greg Brolsema.
[00:14:00.156 --> 00:14:09.884]  One thing we wanted to do for the Post is to become more involved in the community, said Joe McAlvey, one of the COP members, the vets.
[00:14:10.464 --> 00:14:15.488]  They serve their community in a time of war, and coming home, they want to keep serving the community.
[00:14:16.169 --> 00:14:20.871]  While community organizations come to us for money, we want to be more proactive.
[00:14:20.911 --> 00:14:23.892]  We need to get outside the walls of the VFW.
[00:14:24.152 --> 00:14:26.313]  Without the community, we won't be there.
[00:14:28.174 --> 00:14:31.575]  And he goes on then to describe what they're doing.
[00:14:31.635 --> 00:14:38.618]  Just getting started, they're going to be out in parks and in their neighborhoods.
[00:14:39.618 --> 00:14:41.099]  They wear blue shirts.
[00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:46.315]  And they say, when you see the blue shirt, you'll know that we're here doing this.
[00:14:46.915 --> 00:14:51.620]  And it says, we're just getting started, but we'll do patrols as long as we're comfortable doing so.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:58.245]  And it goes on to say, it's all about making this a safer community, and what we're doing is just watching.
[00:15:01.748 --> 00:15:02.149]  Oh boy!
[00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.471]  And, yeah, we know what you do.
[00:15:05.491 --> 00:15:09.674]  I mean, this Alabama situation that I learned is in 30 other states.
[00:15:10.154 --> 00:15:16.417]  They just issue military police armbands, camouflage uniforms.
[00:15:16.497 --> 00:15:20.379]  They have their own armored vehicles, their own machine guns.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.861]  We have their own photos on our own website.
[00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:27.483]  And they just go out with huge spotlights and shine them up in the sky.
[00:15:27.503 --> 00:15:32.226]  It does nothing but train children how to live under this system.
[00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:44.778]  I've got Associated Press reports with the Neighborhood Watch programs going, we're being taught how to look for women that look like they're pregnant but really aren't, or priests, or women with baby carriages.
[00:15:45.439 --> 00:15:49.581]  We're going to fight terror and crime, and we're going to be watching our neighbors.
[00:15:50.301 --> 00:16:00.266]  Meanwhile, right here in Austin, Texas and across the country, I've seen literally hundreds of reports where the school children are given their own little Tattletail digital card with a smart chip in it.
[00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:06.666]  They're given $200 per family member, neighbor, people in the school they turn in.
[00:16:08.087 --> 00:16:22.558]  Hundreds and hundreds of school districts that we know of for an entire semester in the 6th, 7th, 8th grade, depending on the school district, have a BATF or FBI liaison, that is through a federal grant.
[00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:28.203]  A local sheriff's deputy is deputized by the feds and teaches year-round.
[00:16:28.924 --> 00:16:30.425]  Again, it's a semester class.
[00:16:31.404 --> 00:16:31.660]  Uh oh.
[00:16:32.441 --> 00:16:39.845]  We'll teach two courses a year in there and we've read the reports, we've got the documents, it's in my film The Takeover.
[00:16:40.245 --> 00:17:01.117]  They sit there and have the children write a journal that's passed in every day and the police officer reads it and it's in the agreement that they quote are on the playground questioning the students and quote developing after-school relationships with them and now under the new draft to graduate from high school you'll have to serve in this and have to serve at checkpoint duty
[00:17:02.401 --> 00:17:06.044]  Or have to serve in Fugitive Apprehension or Warrant Service?
[00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:08.906]  Folks, I have all the mainstream news articles.
[00:17:09.706 --> 00:17:15.570]  Literal brown shirts, I'm sorry, blue shirts is what this particular group is going to wear.
[00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:22.135]  The federal legislation that passed in 98 to start this says they will wear grey uniforms
[00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:32.670]  So just just just myriad squads of people being formed everywhere and again there's not going to be any real terrorists, you know, guys in turbans to fight with.
[00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:47.922]  So it's going to be crime and fugitive apprehension and checkpoints and DWI and they're going to simulate these DWI car crashes which they do all over the country to heighten the fear and simulate terror drills and terror attacks.
[00:17:47.962 --> 00:17:48.603]  They've got one of these
[00:17:48.983 --> 00:17:50.884]  Coming up in Austin on August 30th.
[00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:54.305]  Already had one just last week that no one was told about.
[00:17:54.885 --> 00:17:59.066]  These simulated events to psychologically condition us.
[00:18:01.507 --> 00:18:09.449]  Here's another article, this one out of the Christian Science Monitor, in War on Terror, an expanded citizens' brigade.
[00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.091]  And it says on a photo here,
[00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:21.630]  Kamran Akhtar left a federal courthouse Tuesday at a hearing in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:28.371]  The Pakistani citizen was detained last month after being spotted making videotapes of Charlotte skyscrapers.
[00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:31.272]  He has family that lives in Austin, we learned.
[00:18:32.812 --> 00:18:38.093]  Well, he is video buff and likes to videotape capitals and things.
[00:18:38.293 --> 00:18:44.734]  I have to admit, folks, when I am a tourist and when I have time to go on a trip, I, too, videotape landmarks.
[00:18:46.267 --> 00:18:50.390]  I remember being a young child at the Hoover Dam taking a 35mm photo.
[00:18:52.311 --> 00:18:53.372]  I've got it somewhere.
[00:18:53.412 --> 00:18:54.712]  Will I be arrested next?
[00:18:55.693 --> 00:19:11.663]  Again, setting that precedent, and clearly looking at this guy, he's done absolutely nothing, no connection to terrorists, but if you try to go to New York City and pull your video camera out now to videotape the police, they run over and hit you on the head with a 2x4 basically and say, you're a terrorist.
[00:19:12.535 --> 00:19:13.916]  Why, we've got to get tough.
[00:19:14.076 --> 00:19:15.396]  Mike Wallace argued with us.
[00:19:15.436 --> 00:19:16.517]  We had to arrest him.
[00:19:16.537 --> 00:19:18.057]  He asked, why are you doing this?
[00:19:18.497 --> 00:19:19.858]  Well, sir, we're going to arrest you now.
[00:19:20.278 --> 00:19:22.059]  Oh, you're chewing a candy bar aggressively.
[00:19:22.139 --> 00:19:24.300]  Oh, you're sitting on a park bench in an improper fashion.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.021]  We have to arrest everyone.
[00:19:26.221 --> 00:19:26.521]  Why?
[00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:28.261]  Things changed after 9-11.
[00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:39.286]  And it says now that they arrested this guy, that the citizens are being recruited to call for the arrest of anyone seen with a video camera.
[00:19:40.675 --> 00:19:43.477]  Meanwhile, they're putting cameras up everywhere looking at us.
[00:19:44.357 --> 00:19:57.465]  Terrorists wouldn't need to take a video camera and videotape things because every major landmark is on online video feeds that the feds have that they encourage citizens to go look at and spy on.
[00:19:57.645 --> 00:19:58.325]  It's ridiculous.
[00:19:58.385 --> 00:19:59.166]  It's a complete joke.
[00:20:00.063 --> 00:20:03.346]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:20:03.406 --> 00:20:07.570]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.632]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:20:10.812 --> 00:20:13.214]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:20:13.415 --> 00:20:22.062]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:20:22.242 --> 00:20:23.583]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:20:23.783 --> 00:20:27.927]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:20:27.967 --> 00:20:28.587]  We're good to go!
[00:20:59.869 --> 00:21:02.231]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:21:02.491 --> 00:21:06.335]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:21:06.655 --> 00:21:07.476]  Read the labels.
[00:21:07.896 --> 00:21:12.020]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.444]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:21:16.804 --> 00:21:21.689]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:25.651]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:21:25.831 --> 00:21:31.155]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:21:31.435 --> 00:21:34.176]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.051]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:22:10.291 --> 00:22:11.672]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:22:11.972 --> 00:22:13.273]  Now is the time to fight back.

[00:23:02.486 --> 00:23:05.906]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:23:06.407 --> 00:23:07.087]  Let's update.
[00:23:07.587 --> 00:23:11.348]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:23:11.708 --> 00:23:15.429]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[00:23:16.089 --> 00:23:17.049]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:23:17.069 --> 00:23:19.410]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:20.830]  Today, the U.S.
[00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.091]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[00:23:23.471 --> 00:23:24.971]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:23:25.575 --> 00:23:27.557]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[00:23:28.898 --> 00:23:33.781]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:23:34.762 --> 00:23:36.924]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[00:23:37.324 --> 00:23:39.866]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:23:40.518 --> 00:23:41.899]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.041]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:23:44.461 --> 00:23:46.463]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:48.945]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.127 --> 00:23:53.289]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.949]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:24:10.356 --> 00:24:11.957]  This is a very important point.
[00:24:12.037 --> 00:24:23.005]  I have an article here about how there's no real security at the Olympic Games going on at the birthplace of the Games in Athens, Greece.
[00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:33.293]  Oh, they've got Big Brother face scanning cameras and troops in black and green, ski masks everywhere, and there's lots of that on the news training you how to live under that.
[00:24:34.153 --> 00:24:40.156]  But reporters are saying that you can just easily waltz right up to dignitaries, world leaders, and be 60 feet away.
[00:24:42.097 --> 00:24:46.459]  And news agencies have done simulations of getting weapons in.
[00:24:47.999 --> 00:24:53.782]  And folks that were there on the ground that we interviewed who were there in Boston.
[00:24:54.863 --> 00:24:56.423]  It was all just for the cameras.
[00:24:56.463 --> 00:24:57.824]  It was all just an illusion.
[00:24:58.934 --> 00:25:07.077]  And it's the same thing with this Pakistani man, and they've arrested a lot of other people out with video cameras videotaping landmarks.
[00:25:07.877 --> 00:25:14.640]  Did you know that there are federal and state websites where they encourage the citizenry to go watch the surveillance cameras?
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:24.484]  I mean, I can go online and look at all the surveillance cameras that are hooked into the grid in Atlanta, Georgia, New York City, Austin, Texas.
[00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.633]  It's all right there, and suppose a terrorist knew this.
[00:25:30.414 --> 00:25:32.556]  Terrorists can have hidden cameras.
[00:25:33.977 --> 00:25:39.262]  Terrorists can go online and find photos of whatever landmarks they want from every conceivable angle.
[00:25:39.969 --> 00:25:40.889]  This is insane!
[00:25:41.429 --> 00:26:04.914]  Someone with no criminal record, no background, no connection to terrorists, gets arrested, and then now, you know, the Christian Science Monitor says that, oh, citizen tattletale squads are being formed to keep us safe after last week's terror warnings, which turned out to be four years old, but oh, those have been bolstered by a Pakistani in Austin and other cities videotaping things.
[00:26:05.035 --> 00:26:07.155]  Brace for nuclear attack!
[00:26:07.876 --> 00:26:09.376]  Joining us is Paul Watson.
[00:26:09.396 --> 00:26:12.937]  He's got a bunch of news he wants to go over and cover that, believe me, you'll want to stay with us for that.
[00:26:13.817 --> 00:26:20.958]  But, Paul, I mean, this development of somebody's got a video camera, they're a terrorist, this is very convenient.
[00:26:22.199 --> 00:26:29.500]  Well, yeah, and it's the same vacuum of common sense as is displayed with the Stars of the Society article that you were just talking about.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.621]  I mean, it talks about people who request information at amusement parks.
[00:26:35.416 --> 00:26:36.937]  That's a sign of terrorism.
[00:26:37.337 --> 00:26:40.619]  And obviously, as you just said, taking photographs of famous landmarks.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:52.127]  It reminds me of that satirical cartoon a few months back, which came out after the FBI had said that, you know, people who buy almanacs may be terrorists.
[00:26:52.227 --> 00:26:57.951]  And the cartoon is where the wife calls Homeland on her husband because he's reading the morning paper.
[00:26:58.311 --> 00:27:03.234]  And, you know, the train conductor screams Al-Qaeda after a man asks him for the time.
[00:27:03.815 --> 00:27:04.075]  I mean,
[00:27:04.998 --> 00:27:05.598]  It's amazing.
[00:27:05.658 --> 00:27:13.942]  I've talked to people who have had their neighbours called the Department of Defence because they stay up later at night than most other people.
[00:27:14.002 --> 00:27:19.845]  The neighbours considered that they may be terrorists because they don't go to bed until 2am.
[00:27:19.925 --> 00:27:20.905]  How crazy is that?
[00:27:20.925 --> 00:27:26.768]  And what's, you know, more disturbing is that the DoD actually sent people around to investigate it.
[00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:50.113]  Well, what they do is they create this atmosphere of fear, something must be done, and when they get hundreds of thousands of little tattletale wannabes all lined up in their new uniforms, whether they're blue or grey or camo, just myriad organizations out there doing this now, there's no real terrorism to fight, and as we said they would do, Homeland Security's going, okay, crime is care, look for crime.
[00:27:51.286 --> 00:28:07.446]  Yeah, I mean, the definition of what they called suspicious behavior, that same line we hear over and over again, in the fear-mongering leaflets, the ones that I've seen, which are sent out by the government in both the UK and Australia to every home.
[00:28:07.606 --> 00:28:09.168]  We now have those here that are even worse.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.363]  And, you know, suspicious behavior is defined as almost anything.
[00:28:13.403 --> 00:28:23.350]  It's so broad that, you know, the kind of scum who've got nothing better to do than harass people who are minding their own business will jump on anything, call it suspicious, and then call Homeland.
[00:28:24.187 --> 00:28:32.510]  So, it's about creating fear, just like in all major airports, where they have these, you know, glass display cases showing the things that they have confiscated.
[00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:37.892]  Everybody knows what a penknife looks like, but why do they have to put it out there to show people?
[00:28:37.952 --> 00:28:48.315]  And it's to remind people of the fear, it's to remind people of 9-11, and a lot of this nonsense from the Stasi Society comes from us going to these airports and just accepting all this.
[00:28:48.755 --> 00:28:49.735]  Well, here's an example.
[00:28:49.875 --> 00:28:51.336]  I got a pair of shoes wet,
[00:28:52.359 --> 00:29:01.201]  And then they got all grimy and so I got a can of Desenex and it looks like powdered sugar or cocaine.
[00:29:01.981 --> 00:29:08.402]  And I was putting some in there and it got on the counter and I had a repairman coming over in about an hour and I got the powder off the table.
[00:29:08.923 --> 00:29:15.784]  Because I don't want them to, when they come in here, to see some Desenex anti-fungal powder on the table.
[00:29:15.944 --> 00:29:20.005]  Because folks, I see articles every day where stuff like that gets you a SWAT team rate.
[00:29:21.204 --> 00:29:21.424]  Yeah.
[00:29:21.504 --> 00:29:22.946]  That's all part of the freedom, Paul.
[00:29:23.546 --> 00:29:30.473]  It makes you more conscious of it, which then inculcates that suspicion into you, so you do get hyper about it.
[00:29:30.573 --> 00:29:31.874]  And Paul, I'm not paranoid.
[00:29:31.934 --> 00:29:35.017]  I've had a carpet cleaner almost call the cops on me for a shotgun.
[00:29:35.257 --> 00:29:39.761]  Yeah, now they're putting these sensors in airports which test stress levels for suspicious behavior.
[00:29:41.303 --> 00:29:41.923]  Stay there, Paul.
[00:29:41.943 --> 00:29:46.247]  We're going to come back and get into all the top stories and take calls, and we've got some interesting guests coming up, too.

[00:31:06.247 --> 00:31:09.708]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.

[00:33:13.988 --> 00:33:18.172]  All right, my friends, we're now 33 minutes and 15 seconds into this first hour.
[00:33:18.192 --> 00:33:25.119]  We're going to be taking your calls here in about 10 minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:25.139 --> 00:33:30.444]  Any of the news issues we bring up, you're welcome to call in about or any news items you want to discuss, questions or comments.
[00:33:30.844 --> 00:33:31.945]  We're talking to Paul Watson.
[00:33:31.965 --> 00:33:36.830]  He's my webmaster for the PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv side of our InfoWar.
[00:33:37.963 --> 00:33:44.159]  Paul, let's go over the top stories on PrisonPlanet.com and what you think is most important right now, today.
[00:33:45.126 --> 00:34:01.833]  Well, I think the main story is the threat to shoot independent journalists who don't leave Najaf because, you know, any government that has to go to the length of threatening to kill journalists in order to stop them reporting on something has something pretty substantial to hide.
[00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:04.274]  And in Iraq it's no different.
[00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:09.156]  Yesterday they ordered all foreign journalists to leave Najaf or they would be shot.
[00:34:09.936 --> 00:34:14.381]  At first they actually told the journalists that there was a bomb threat to their hotel.
[00:34:14.882 --> 00:34:21.970]  But the only threat to the hotel was when the Iraqi police actually started firing at the hotel as a means of intimidation.
[00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:24.193]  Now I want to stop you right there.
[00:34:24.853 --> 00:34:30.294]  I have the London Telegraph, I have the Associated Press in front of me, but it's not really on our nightly news.
[00:34:30.574 --> 00:34:31.714]  You have to read the news wires.
[00:34:32.234 --> 00:34:40.256]  You have a huge archive on PrisonPlanet.com, I hope you can link this under this story for people, Paul, where they admittedly have targeted journalists.
[00:34:40.276 --> 00:34:42.376]  Now think of the open criminality of this.
[00:34:43.617 --> 00:34:44.897]  And at the same time, guess what?
[00:34:45.097 --> 00:34:50.118]  Al-Cieda, they're now saying that gunmen threatened to kill British journalists
[00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:52.069]  Unless U.S.
[00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:53.811]  withdrawal from NAJIF.
[00:34:54.391 --> 00:34:58.935]  So we've got both sides supposedly saying the same thing.
[00:34:58.975 --> 00:35:03.679]  So Paul, go over more of the newest development, but let's go back over some of those past examples.
[00:35:04.682 --> 00:35:25.070]  Well yeah, we know that the policy of eliminating independent journalists spans back before the war even started because it was reported by the BBC and on Irish radio that the Pentagon publicly stated that if satellite uplinks were detected in Iraq and around Baghdad that they hadn't authorised and approved.
[00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:30.214]  Then they would be fired upon and destroyed along with, obviously, the people broadcasting from them.
[00:35:31.675 --> 00:35:40.061]  The bombing of the Palestine Hotel which housed journalists in Baghdad, the investigation later concluded that it was carried out by US tanks.
[00:35:40.121 --> 00:35:41.322]  The footage showed that.
[00:35:41.803 --> 00:35:43.004]  That killed several people.
[00:35:43.604 --> 00:35:58.271]  And then you have cases like that of Mazan Darna, the award-winning Reuters cameraman who uncovered evidence of mass graves being dug where US troops were buried to hide the real casualty numbers from the US public.
[00:35:58.331 --> 00:36:00.452]  And he was, you know, shot in the head.
[00:36:00.652 --> 00:36:02.473]  And there's video of the tank rolling right up.
[00:36:02.513 --> 00:36:04.334]  He says hi to them and they machine gun him.
[00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:13.196]  Yeah, and obviously these people, the tanks know that they're journalists because they wear the clothing which identifies them.
[00:36:13.216 --> 00:36:17.700]  There's no shooting, no fighting going up and Abrams rolls right up and kills him at 50 yards!
[00:36:18.681 --> 00:36:28.850]  Yeah, and we know that they've tried to keep a heavy lid on those real casualty numbers which is why you've got possibly thousands of troops buried in mass graves around Iraq.
[00:36:29.637 --> 00:36:33.139]  Um, the death of Terry Lloyd, the British journalist.
[00:36:33.679 --> 00:36:37.301]  Again, that investigation later concluded that he was killed by U.S.
[00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:40.102]  troops, but it only came out a month later in the back of the paper.
[00:36:40.683 --> 00:36:47.906]  Then you've had Italian, Spanish journalists all brutally executed on the spot, you know, if they filmed anything they weren't supposed to.
[00:36:48.607 --> 00:36:55.490]  And then on top of that, of course, the mandatory shutdown of any newspapers who mildly criticized the authorities.
[00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.132]  Uh, there was this big... Well, that's democracy at its best, Bubba!
[00:36:59.798 --> 00:37:06.921]  Yeah, I mean, at the time there was this big thing about, you know, oh look, there are dozens of new newspapers cropping up everywhere.
[00:37:06.941 --> 00:37:08.622]  We've given them freedom of the press.
[00:37:09.122 --> 00:37:14.025]  Meanwhile, you know, they're bombing media buildings if they refuse to follow these shutdown orders.
[00:37:14.485 --> 00:37:29.012]  And then we have a bomb threat of the media's hotel yesterday, and then it turns out it's not a real bomb threat, and our loving military with the Iraqi goons that they've hired are machine-gunning it,
[00:37:30.102 --> 00:37:32.825]  Imagine if Al-Syedah was machine-gunning reporters.
[00:37:33.105 --> 00:37:35.107]  Oh, look how barbaric they are!
[00:37:35.147 --> 00:37:37.369]  But our government does it, and it's a good thing, Paul.
[00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:47.417]  Yeah, and they're doing it because they're about to go into Najaf and level it, like they did in Fallujah, and there will be hundreds of civilian casualties which won't get reported on.
[00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:56.175]  And now we've got Iranian journalists coming out and saying that the government of Iran, saying that they have been kidnapped by the government.
[00:37:56.195 --> 00:38:02.519]  So, you know, just how many of these disappearing journalists have been the victim of these stage kidnappings?
[00:38:04.167 --> 00:38:05.048]  Well, that's the point.
[00:38:05.068 --> 00:38:10.212]  You've got some Iraqi security force people who formerly were torture lords in Iran, admittedly.
[00:38:10.832 --> 00:38:15.856]  And you've got old fat guys dressed up, not the normal Muslim radical, all skinny and in shape.
[00:38:16.156 --> 00:38:20.640]  Fat guys stumbling around in what obviously is fake beheading videos.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.901]  The body had obviously already been dead, even if it was real.
[00:38:23.282 --> 00:38:24.883]  And then it looks just like Abu Ghraib.
[00:38:24.923 --> 00:38:25.463]  And guess what?
[00:38:25.483 --> 00:38:26.804]  The guy actually worked at Abu Ghraib.
[00:38:26.824 --> 00:38:28.826]  And he was in FBI custody and gets released.
[00:38:29.646 --> 00:38:35.152]  Oh no, these vicious Iraqis our government's hired, they wouldn't cut somebody's head off to blame it on their enemies, would they Paul?
[00:38:35.953 --> 00:38:44.883]  Well no, and one of the last beheading videos, I think it took place last week, it's hard to keep up with them now, there are so many of these staged kidnaps and beheadings.
[00:38:45.444 --> 00:38:51.405]  Well, I personally checked the website from which it was uploaded, and it was based in Pasadena, California.
[00:38:51.565 --> 00:38:56.126]  Just like, you know, they're either based in places like California, Texas, or London.
[00:38:56.146 --> 00:38:58.267]  They're always uploaded from these locations.
[00:38:58.967 --> 00:39:08.429]  Well, they're also uploaded directly from government websites in the facilities up in Arkansas, and then they upload fake videos and it fools people.
[00:39:08.469 --> 00:39:09.549]  I mean, this is getting ridiculous.
[00:39:10.792 --> 00:39:15.854]  Yes, I mean from front to back it's about shutting down free speech and any criticism of the government.
[00:39:15.894 --> 00:39:22.997]  I mean people are hooded and taken to the camp for, you know, shouting anti-coalition slogans was the statement in the Associated Press.
[00:39:23.638 --> 00:39:29.240]  And the shutdown of all this free speech has got nothing to do with preventing dissent, you know, from causing violence.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.182]  All the violence and most of the car bombings from the evidence that we've looked at
[00:39:33.762 --> 00:39:46.901]  Show direct involvement and obviously help the puppet government because it allowed them to pass the martial law provisions the kind of You know where they go into towns and disarm everybody where they felt 9 p.m.
[00:39:46.921 --> 00:39:50.045]  Curfews and they had already prepared all these provisions and
[00:39:50.765 --> 00:39:53.186]  Before the wave of car bombings escalated.
[00:39:53.266 --> 00:39:55.066]  So it only helps the puppet government.
[00:39:55.506 --> 00:40:01.027]  And now they've hired Mr. Negroponte, who admittedly ran death squads in Latin America.
[00:40:01.587 --> 00:40:04.268]  They're sending this guy over to Iraq.
[00:40:04.288 --> 00:40:07.228]  And let me boil something down for the people that are just tuning in.
[00:40:08.728 --> 00:40:13.149]  We've been talking about torture forever, because our government's trained the world how to torture.
[00:40:13.169 --> 00:40:16.970]  They hired Nazis after World War II to train our troops
[00:40:18.078 --> 00:40:18.818]  How to Torture.
[00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:24.161]  That's Congressional, bipartisan reports going back to the 70's.
[00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:24.762]  Okay?
[00:40:25.562 --> 00:40:35.168]  And so people who want to make excuses about all of this, you're literally with Klaus Barbie and Joseph Mingala now, and then you say, well, we're in a war, we've got to torture.
[00:40:35.588 --> 00:40:41.011]  Well, what do you say to the Army's own report saying children and women picked up for not having their papers in order or
[00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.190]  It's
[00:41:00.979 --> 00:41:06.463]  The Pentagon's $6 billion program, P-2-O-G, said it is about getting resistance.
[00:41:06.543 --> 00:41:07.804]  It is about having a war.
[00:41:07.864 --> 00:41:09.085]  It's about having a fight.
[00:41:09.525 --> 00:41:12.848]  They don't want the Iraqis to love us, which they did, frankly, at first.
[00:41:12.908 --> 00:41:13.908]  Most of them appreciate it.
[00:41:14.269 --> 00:41:15.570]  They want it to get bad.
[00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:28.219]  They want there to be resistance, because then the war can go on for a decade, like Vietnam, and the globalists can make not hundreds of billions, but over a trillion dollars in the aggregate out of it, and use it as an ongoing crisis and destruction.
[00:41:28.739 --> 00:41:30.700]  And that's what you've got to understand.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:38.163]  And so to all the people out there that have made excuses that say, oh, go ahead and kill journalists, you know, Reuters reporters on the street or in their hotel.
[00:41:38.463 --> 00:41:40.044]  Go ahead and torture people to death.
[00:41:40.404 --> 00:41:41.605]  What happened to you?
[00:41:41.705 --> 00:41:43.085]  What happened to your soul?
[00:41:43.426 --> 00:41:44.186]  To your mind?
[00:41:44.246 --> 00:41:45.246]  We're America!
[00:41:45.547 --> 00:41:46.707]  We don't act like this!
[00:41:46.787 --> 00:41:48.908]  And to begin with, it's not being done to win.
[00:41:49.208 --> 00:41:53.130]  It's being done to infuriate and to create more resistance, Paul.
[00:41:54.335 --> 00:41:55.536]  Well, that's exactly the point.
[00:41:55.716 --> 00:42:02.501]  It's geared towards creating the very civil war which, you know, can then spill over to Iran and give them a pretext to invade Iran.
[00:42:03.022 --> 00:42:11.048]  But on the torture point, we now have this new article which shows us that many of the troops are aware of this and they actually try to prevent it.
[00:42:11.128 --> 00:42:16.853]  This article out of the Oregon newspaper where the Iraqi police were caught torturing the prisoners
[00:42:17.553 --> 00:42:26.197]  Um, this troop squadron was sent in to, um, basically save the prisoners, but then it was ordered back, ordered to leave, so the torture could continue.
[00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:30.659]  Well, it's the same thing with, uh, the female, uh, General Watkilpinski.
[00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:36.551]  She admittedly said, look, don't try to scapegoat me.
[00:42:36.731 --> 00:42:38.451]  I was never even allowed in these wings.
[00:42:38.591 --> 00:42:40.872]  I tried to stop it and the documents got released.
[00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:43.193]  So what they do is they go after somebody who's innocent.
[00:42:43.513 --> 00:42:47.435]  So when she's found innocent, then, oh, see, the whole thing must be okay.
[00:42:47.515 --> 00:42:50.756]  The private CIA contractors ran these areas.
[00:42:50.776 --> 00:42:51.236]  Yeah, it's...
[00:43:13.911 --> 00:43:21.037]  Well, again, this Oregon thing points out that, you know, it was coming directly from the top and we know the name of the program, it was Copper Green.
[00:43:21.457 --> 00:43:38.211]  But then they throw out these fake photographs, like in the British newspaper The Mirror, where those photographs were fake, but in the exact same prison camp and the exact same troop squadron, they did the real torture a week after The Mirror announced that the pictures were fake.
[00:43:38.411 --> 00:43:44.234]  And then out of that same unit, troops give them fake photos weeks before, preemptively, to neutralize that.
[00:43:45.075 --> 00:43:53.039]  Yes, and with the case with the photos which were put out all over the internet which were nothing to do with Iraq.
[00:43:53.079 --> 00:43:55.000]  They were taken from porn websites.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.321]  The Boston Globe carries them as real.
[00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:00.943]  Days after it had been admitted that they were faked.
[00:44:00.983 --> 00:44:04.405]  And beforehand, Paul, I looked at them and we put on the site that we thought they were fake.
[00:44:05.382 --> 00:44:07.983]  Yeah, well, as soon as we looked at them, we thought they were fake.
[00:44:08.343 --> 00:44:14.266]  Because they showed individuals who were obviously not of Iraqi descent being tortured and sexually abused.
[00:44:14.446 --> 00:44:15.686]  You know, it was obvious to see.
[00:44:16.107 --> 00:44:22.569]  But then the Boston Globe put them out after they'd already known that they were fake, and then publicly apologized the day after.
[00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:23.330]  That's right.
[00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:29.072]  Two days after it's admittedly fake, Tottenham's story, they publish them and then apologize the next day.
[00:44:29.392 --> 00:44:30.673]  This is done on purpose.
[00:44:31.153 --> 00:44:37.035]  On purpose, to make people think that, you know, each time this kind of thing happens, that it's fake.
[00:44:37.095 --> 00:44:38.355]  It's to put out that feeling.
[00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:39.235]  Well, here's an example.
[00:44:39.295 --> 00:44:40.656]  I've had arguments with people on the streets.
[00:44:40.696 --> 00:44:42.696]  They go, there's no torture, Alex, why do you keep saying it?
[00:44:42.917 --> 00:44:43.877]  They admit all that's fake.
[00:44:43.917 --> 00:44:46.558]  I go, the Army's own reports, two of them.
[00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:50.459]  The Congress went and looked at thousands of photos and videos.
[00:44:50.599 --> 00:44:53.620]  It's admitted worse stuff than what we saw.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.821]  And they just shake their head and go, no, no, no, Alex, I heard it's fake.
[00:44:56.861 --> 00:44:57.801]  You're a commie liar.
[00:44:58.963 --> 00:45:05.468]  It was already out two years previously that the same practices were taking place at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:45:05.508 --> 00:45:09.051]  That's where the program was transferred from, but there was no outcry at that point.
[00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:12.694]  They did things, and are still doing things, that we can't even mention on the air, folks.
[00:45:13.835 --> 00:45:22.541]  And you dovetail that with the LA Times article from August of 2002, which was entitled, No Leaders of Al-Qaeda Found at Guantanamo.
[00:45:23.182 --> 00:45:25.243]  These people are, you know, shoemakers.
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:28.661]  You know, stonemasons and people like that.
[00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:36.124]  They were just thrown out onto the battlefields, and now they're in those camps to, again, give this perception that real terrorists exist and that we're being protected.
[00:45:36.164 --> 00:45:48.509]  Meanwhile, the 8,000 Taliban Al-Qaeda cream, as one special forces colonel said, were loaded on helicopters, flown to airfields, and flown out on C-130s, and even Fox News admits it, but goes, oh, it was just an accident, Paul.
[00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:53.793]  You know, they just accidentally loaded 8,000 Taliban Al Qaeda on planes and flew them out.
[00:45:53.853 --> 00:45:55.253]  Let's take calls here.
[00:45:55.654 --> 00:45:58.055]  Leslie in Tennessee, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:45:58.095 --> 00:45:58.515]  Go ahead.
[00:45:58.955 --> 00:45:59.896]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[00:46:00.396 --> 00:46:05.519]  Alex, I've got a couple of real hardcore questions.
[00:46:06.139 --> 00:46:09.421]  What I want to do is just go ahead and just run through this stuff.
[00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:10.482]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:46:10.582 --> 00:46:12.663]  And then I'll just hang up and let you guys have at it.
[00:46:13.925 --> 00:46:20.786]  We have a situation today where we have Tweedledee and Tweedledum for candidates.
[00:46:20.866 --> 00:46:22.727]  I mean, these guys are mirrors of each other.
[00:46:22.747 --> 00:46:26.407]  And Kerry says he's now for the war even though there's no weapons of mass destruction.
[00:46:26.647 --> 00:46:33.829]  You know, we've got two guys that are both members of... they're both bonzers.
[00:46:34.629 --> 00:46:36.809]  They're both white about their military records.
[00:46:36.929 --> 00:46:38.129]  One of them went over the wall.
[00:46:38.409 --> 00:46:41.230]  The other guy got himself three phony
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:49.922]  Purple Heart so he could duck out of the active military service over in Vietnam.
[00:46:50.022 --> 00:46:52.162]  Well, I'll tell you my answer to this is it doesn't matter.
[00:46:52.202 --> 00:46:53.923]  The presidential election is staged.
[00:46:54.343 --> 00:46:57.464]  The real focus should be at the county, city, state level.
[00:46:57.604 --> 00:46:59.244]  There's no difference between Bush and Kerry.
[00:47:00.205 --> 00:47:00.985]  What's your question?
[00:47:01.125 --> 00:47:03.465]  Well, my question is this.
[00:47:03.825 --> 00:47:08.387]  If we have ourselves in a situation where regardless of
[00:47:10.051 --> 00:47:20.494]  The outcome of this election, I really believe that we already have pre-planned terrorist attacks staged to happen probably before the election.
[00:47:20.514 --> 00:47:28.837]  And with that in mind, where are we at and what can we really do at this point?
[00:47:28.937 --> 00:47:29.858]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[00:47:30.298 --> 00:47:30.918]  Good questions.
[00:47:32.111 --> 00:47:35.915]  Number one, we can expose who has the motive for the terrorism.
[00:47:35.935 --> 00:47:38.378]  The giving up liberty gives us tyranny, not security.
[00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:41.301]  That they've done nothing to really keep us safe.
[00:47:41.341 --> 00:47:42.782]  The borders are more open than ever.
[00:47:42.822 --> 00:47:47.047]  They're releasing hundreds of thousands of felons in South Texas alone that are arrested.
[00:47:47.547 --> 00:47:49.009]  Front page of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:47:49.809 --> 00:48:02.115]  We've got to educate people that it is the military-industrial complex behind the terror to scare the people into being slaves of the government to be used for a national draft.
[00:48:02.195 --> 00:48:09.598]  America is being forged into a weapon of empire and we're being forged by the heat of fear of terrorism, Paul.
[00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:20.510]  Well, yeah, and I just find it interesting thinking ahead, you know, after likely Kerry is elected as he's been ordained by the Bilderberg Group and so is Edwards, so...
[00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:25.099]  Let's take the presumption that there is no terror attack before the election.
[00:48:25.519 --> 00:48:28.560]  Then, at that point, it's likely that Kerry will be elected.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:37.062]  And shortly after, you'll see a raft of new wars launched on humanitarian grounds rather than, you know, threat to America grounds.
[00:48:37.122 --> 00:48:40.963]  So it will be interesting to see how the left wing react to that.
[00:48:41.523 --> 00:48:50.508]  Um, if they, if they support, you know, the humanitarian wars as they did with wars like, you know, the bombing of Serbia, which was crafted totally on a fraud.
[00:48:50.548 --> 00:48:57.553]  The Belsen 92 so-called concentration camp footage, um, where it was a Serbian death camp.
[00:48:57.633 --> 00:48:59.053]  Actually, it was a refugee camp.
[00:48:59.434 --> 00:49:04.917]  So, it'd just be interesting to see how the... And the barbed wire was around, the barbed wire was around the pantry to protect the food.
[00:49:05.979 --> 00:49:13.066]  Yeah, and then the people, the film crew were filming outside of the camp, on the other side of the fence.
[00:49:13.126 --> 00:49:19.673]  The film crew were inside the camp, but they made it look as if, and they wrote a story, that the prisoners were inside the camp.
[00:49:19.713 --> 00:49:23.276]  And the people were up against the fence begging for food, looking in on the inside.
[00:49:24.097 --> 00:49:32.020]  Yeah, they singled out one emaciated man who had had a childhood disease which made him emaciated and skinny.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.521]  And they said, look, they're starving people to death.
[00:49:34.581 --> 00:49:35.802]  Let's launch a war.
[00:49:35.822 --> 00:49:39.823]  So it'd be interesting to see how the left react to those kind of provocations.
[00:49:39.903 --> 00:49:44.305]  Yeah, Newsweek at the time had that skinny guy with the disease.
[00:49:44.345 --> 00:49:45.706]  And then, of course, you see the video later.
[00:49:45.726 --> 00:49:50.148]  There's all these fat people on either side of him looking into the fence, begging for food.
[00:49:50.188 --> 00:49:53.589]  It was a NATO base protecting itself with barbed wire.
[00:49:54.375 --> 00:49:59.682]  Yes, it's just a different circumstance, but it's just as big a lie as weapons of mass destruction.
[00:49:59.762 --> 00:50:08.874]  Well then, remember Bill Clinton during the Serb War went down to the Albanian coast of the border with Hillary and Hillary stood there and went, look at the barbed wire, look at the trains.
[00:50:09.495 --> 00:50:20.405]  And it was trains coming down, and people begging to be let on them to go back to Serbia, all down there at the fence, locked out of Albania.
[00:50:21.046 --> 00:50:22.587]  And they're going, look, barbed wire!
[00:50:22.707 --> 00:50:23.428]  It's a camp!
[00:50:23.448 --> 00:50:25.310]  And people watch that.
[00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:27.992]  They're at the border, looking through the barbed wire, wanting in.
[00:50:28.012 --> 00:50:28.933]  It's just incredible.
[00:50:29.739 --> 00:50:34.984]  And at the same time, obviously, we have Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda helping them as it's come out publicly now.
[00:50:35.284 --> 00:50:41.029]  So it'll be interesting to see how the left react when we see that cycle of propaganda come around again in 2005.
[00:50:41.209 --> 00:50:41.769]  They're gonna love it.
[00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:42.950]  They're gonna love all the wars.
[00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:44.111]  They're gonna love the Patriot Act.
[00:50:44.171 --> 00:50:46.073]  And they're gonna have all the conservatives behind them, too.
[00:50:46.453 --> 00:50:47.774]  So-called conservative, Paul.
[00:50:48.655 --> 00:50:49.896]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:50:50.457 --> 00:50:53.579]  You'll all be psychologically tested for mental illness and forcibly drugged as well.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:54.860]  I'm not kidding.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.881]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:50:55.921 --> 00:50:57.623]  Pressing planet.tv will be right back.
[00:50:57.643 --> 00:50:58.063]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.089 --> 00:51:04.454]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:04.634 --> 00:51:08.999]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:11.812 --> 00:51:13.713]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:30.322 --> 00:51:40.909]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:46.513]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:51:59.501 --> 00:52:05.724]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:05.864 --> 00:52:12.027]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:12.307 --> 00:52:20.751]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.991 --> 00:52:28.014]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:28.314 --> 00:52:33.157]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:33.357 --> 00:52:38.781]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:39.101 --> 00:52:42.203]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:42.524 --> 00:52:50.489]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:52:58.114 --> 00:53:00.835]  I think so.

[00:54:07.739 --> 00:54:29.709]  Folks, I do not agree with many of the stances and activities of the American Friends Service Committee, or the Quakers, but they've been receiving a surprise visit from the FBI at their homes, conservative, liberal groups, so they're definitely having their rights violated and we're against that, so we're going to be talking to them.
[00:54:30.599 --> 00:54:36.600]  It's happening all over the place and Paul will be riding shotgun with us with those guests and of course your phone calls.
[00:54:36.681 --> 00:54:37.961]  I won't have these desks on too long.
[00:54:38.381 --> 00:54:39.441]  That's coming up the next hour.
[00:54:40.221 --> 00:54:59.786]  Also before I end this hour, we're trying to get a call or two in, I would take a few minutes out to encourage all of you to visit PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com and to go to the safe secure online shopping cart and to watch the free video clips of the films, to read about them, to look at the different discounts we have to offer
[00:55:01.175 --> 00:55:08.778]  On 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, the preeminent 9-11 film that I made, Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror, that is excellent, one of my newest videos.
[00:55:09.678 --> 00:55:12.840]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement, with The Matrix of Evil.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.461]  I filmed Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:55:15.781 --> 00:55:17.922]  These videos are all over 2 hours long.
[00:55:17.942 --> 00:55:20.242]  I mean, some of them are 2 hours 44 minutes long, 2 hours 30 minutes long.
[00:55:22.276 --> 00:55:23.477]  Two hours, ten minutes long.
[00:55:23.517 --> 00:55:25.018]  There are multiple films in one.
[00:55:25.538 --> 00:55:27.499]  They're $25.95 apiece.
[00:55:28.079 --> 00:55:30.501]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[00:55:30.921 --> 00:55:34.823]  And your purchase makes this show and my staff and what we do possible.

[00:56:16.034 --> 00:56:17.135]  It's having a big effect.
[00:56:17.475 --> 00:56:19.616]  I want to thank those that have gotten them and have made copies.
[00:56:19.636 --> 00:56:20.657]  You've done an incredible job.
[00:56:20.697 --> 00:56:21.318]  Please keep it up.
[00:56:21.338 --> 00:56:27.082]  1-888-253-3139 or you can write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:56:38.297 --> 00:56:39.819]  What we're going to do is we're going to break here in a minute.
[00:56:39.839 --> 00:56:48.087]  We'll come back and go to Michael and Manuel and Fred, many others that are holding, and then we'll get our service committee people on in the segment after that.
[00:56:48.147 --> 00:56:53.753]  But Paul Watson, here in the last few minutes, I decided I want to plug PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:54.774 --> 00:56:57.497]  Why should folks sign up with PrisonPlanet.tv?
[00:56:58.017 --> 00:56:59.499]  In a nutshell, describe it for people.
[00:57:00.757 --> 00:57:04.198]  Well, just on that point, I've literally doubled my efforts over the weekend.
[00:57:04.258 --> 00:57:12.560]  I bought a new computer for the main reason of which I can upload more videos and audios to prisonplanet.tv for the subscribers.
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:16.481]  So, basically, we're going to try and get a video up there every other day now.
[00:57:17.241 --> 00:57:24.523]  And for £5.95 a month for what's already there in the archives, you know, the physical value of that is worth it alone.
[00:57:25.083 --> 00:57:27.704]  And every audio interview of importance,
[00:57:28.166 --> 00:57:34.171]  Videos up there every other day, special reports, several other features which we're going to roll out in the coming weeks.
[00:57:34.331 --> 00:57:35.412]  Most of our books!
[00:57:36.813 --> 00:57:39.175]  Yeah, two full-length books on there already.
[00:57:39.855 --> 00:57:56.208]  And, you know, people spend more than $5.95 on coffee every day, some people, and so for $5.95 a month, it supports the free side of what we put out, which is substantial, and helps us cover those costs so we can, you know, expand further.
[00:57:56.668 --> 00:57:57.528]  Yeah, it's real simple.
[00:57:57.609 --> 00:57:59.629]  We're victims of our own success.
[00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:12.075]  We could not continue, folks, with four websites, tens of millions of visitors each month, but now you get exclusive, privileged access, PrisonPlanet.tv, and you were talking about some new features before I interrupted you, Paul.
[00:58:13.388 --> 00:58:37.070]  Yeah, well, we're going to throw more special reports up there, we're going to integrate software which allows things like chat rooms which are all moderated, unlike the vast majority of things like that on the internet which are completely, you know, unmoderated and open to abuse but it's all going to be streamlined and so a lot of special things come in and it's going to be worth signing up for a year, I advise.
[00:58:38.812 --> 00:58:39.812]  Absolutely, folks.
[00:58:39.892 --> 00:58:42.233]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:58:42.373 --> 00:58:46.195]  Alright, the second hour is straight ahead.
[00:58:46.655 --> 00:58:49.896]  Your phone calls, news, and Paul Watson and another guest.
[00:58:57.579 --> 00:58:58.239]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:00.000]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:01.801]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.821 --> 00:59:03.942]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.002 --> 00:59:04.762]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:09.493]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.713 --> 00:59:13.857]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:21.783]  Welcome, my friends, to the second hour of this global transmission.
[00:59:22.783 --> 00:59:23.704]  We have the U.S.
[00:59:23.744 --> 00:59:31.910]  military threatening to kill mainstream journalists if they don't pull out of another Iraqi city they're about to blow to bitch.
[00:59:32.431 --> 00:59:35.233]  And we have our own government admitting they've targeted and killed journalists, but
[00:59:35.951 --> 00:59:40.614]  We get upset when Al-Qaeda kills journalists, Al-C-I-A-D-A, but not when our own government does it.
[00:59:40.634 --> 00:59:42.495]  We'll be talking more about that.
[00:59:42.955 --> 00:59:47.158]  People being harassed by the FBI for political reasons, that's coming up.
[00:59:47.198 --> 00:59:48.959]  Paul Watson riding shotgun with us.
[00:59:49.359 --> 01:00:01.207]  I do want to take just a few seconds out to thank Stephanie, who runs the broadcast up in Minnesota, up there at the main network, Studio A. I'm down here in Studio Q, you could say, in Central Texas.
[01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:16.852]  And I'm just thankful to all the AM and FM affiliates, Global Shortwave Affiliate, WWCR, one of my webmasters online with us, Paul Watson, from the Prison Planet websites, you the listeners, the sponsors, everybody, God bless you, thank you.
[01:00:17.472 --> 01:00:18.852]  Of course, thank God, number one.
[01:00:19.732 --> 01:00:21.993]  But Paul, let's jam a few calls in here.
[01:00:22.133 --> 01:00:23.293]  Michael in Colorado.
[01:00:24.234 --> 01:00:25.074]  Oh, Alex, Paul.
[01:00:25.974 --> 01:00:26.894]  Yes, go ahead, Michael.
[01:00:27.215 --> 01:00:28.555]  Good morning, thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:32.421]  First of all, I wanted to say great job on Prison Planet TV, Paul.
[01:00:32.602 --> 01:00:35.824]  It's a great website and I want to encourage all your listeners to get involved with that.
[01:00:35.844 --> 01:00:37.005]  A lot of good information.
[01:00:37.065 --> 01:00:37.465]  Thank you.
[01:00:37.985 --> 01:00:40.387]  I want to let you know we're here in Colorado.
[01:00:40.407 --> 01:00:45.210]  We're working on some of the issues that you talk about on a daily basis, including 9-11.
[01:00:45.931 --> 01:00:53.436]  We formed a 9-11 group and we're having a 9-11 town meeting Friday night with special guest speaker Ellen Mariani.
[01:00:54.297 --> 01:00:55.798]  And of course, she's one of the widows
[01:00:57.086 --> 01:00:59.307]  Our widow were, and we've interviewed her.
[01:00:59.367 --> 01:01:01.507]  She knows the government's behind 9-11.
[01:01:01.948 --> 01:01:03.788]  And you've got her coming to your town.
[01:01:03.828 --> 01:01:04.648]  That's the way to do it.
[01:01:04.688 --> 01:01:05.649]  Be highly visible.
[01:01:05.949 --> 01:01:06.689]  Have marches.
[01:01:06.749 --> 01:01:08.049]  Be mainstream.
[01:01:08.409 --> 01:01:10.990]  Until everybody accepts the world is round.
[01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:16.632]  If you believe the government wasn't involved in 9-11, you think the world is flat, we've got to be visible.
[01:01:16.992 --> 01:01:19.813]  That's the solution to stop the globalists from killing more people.
[01:01:19.853 --> 01:01:20.213]  Go ahead.
[01:01:20.233 --> 01:01:21.033]  That's right.
[01:01:21.073 --> 01:01:22.194]  We're trying to get the word out.
[01:01:22.334 --> 01:01:23.874]  We're making copies of videos.
[01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:25.115]  We're getting flyers out.
[01:01:25.135 --> 01:01:26.295]  We're playing a march on
[01:01:26.966 --> 01:01:29.047]  September 11th in downtown Denver.
[01:01:29.207 --> 01:01:30.828]  Where is this meeting going to be located?
[01:01:31.108 --> 01:01:36.972]  The meeting is going to be at Unity Church in Boulder, Colorado, and the address is 2855 Folsom Road.
[01:01:38.092 --> 01:01:40.434]  If they want to get a hold of me, I can give you a website.
[01:01:40.934 --> 01:01:43.215]  Yeah, give us the website, but tell us the date and time.
[01:01:43.716 --> 01:01:47.738]  Yes, it's going to be Friday night, that's August 20th at 7 o'clock.
[01:01:48.211 --> 01:01:48.471]  Okay.
[01:01:48.611 --> 01:02:01.103]  And the website where they can get a hold of me if they have any questions is GREELY, and that's G-R-E-E-L-E-Y-D-O-R-D-C, and that stands for the Bill of Rights Defense Committee, and that's at dot org.
[01:02:01.563 --> 01:02:05.807]  Alright, or just type into Google, uh, GREELY, Colorado Bill of Rights Defense Committee.
[01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:06.888]  Okay, anything else?
[01:02:07.168 --> 01:02:09.390]  No, uh, that's all, Alex, and thanks for taking my call.
[01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:10.191]  Keep up the good work.
[01:02:10.351 --> 01:02:10.872]  Thank you.
[01:02:11.112 --> 01:02:12.033]  Uh, Paul, uh,
[01:02:12.958 --> 01:02:22.485]  This is really a key part of the solution is every town, every city, every year having a march, saying the government's behind it, having it be right out in the open.
[01:02:22.845 --> 01:02:24.586]  More of us standing up is the answer.
[01:02:24.646 --> 01:02:25.827]  They can't deal with that, can they?
[01:02:26.838 --> 01:02:27.038]  No.
[01:02:27.959 --> 01:02:31.320]  Last time I was on the show we were talking about Austin, Texas being a stronghold.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:38.123]  People need to rally and make every city around America a stronghold because then that only makes us stronger.
[01:02:38.183 --> 01:02:40.244]  It fortifies our movement.
[01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:43.546]  Putting on conferences
[01:02:44.546 --> 01:02:49.010]  Putting together Patriot Act resolutions, that's the kind of activism that really gets the job done.
[01:02:49.450 --> 01:02:52.012]  And it's something you can really sink your teeth to at the same time.
[01:02:52.412 --> 01:02:54.794]  And then, there's a willing audience out there.
[01:02:55.074 --> 01:03:06.102]  I mean, I went out there and handed out flyers before a Michael Moore showing, and every single person that we talked to had at least some knowledge of 9-11, and the fact that the official story was a myth.
[01:03:06.142 --> 01:03:09.365]  So, there's a receptive audience out there, more so than ever before.
[01:03:11.253 --> 01:03:14.915]  And we're talking about the future of humanity, of civilization here.
[01:03:14.975 --> 01:03:23.180]  The globalists have said in their own planning documents they will use terror, they will manufacture terror, they will carry out terror to bring in their new world order.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.561]  Are you going to let them do it?
[01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:27.263]  And a lot of these people are cowards out there.
[01:03:28.061 --> 01:03:36.387]  But as Mark Twain said, in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared, but in time when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:03:36.908 --> 01:03:41.531]  We've got to be the first over the barbed wire, the first to hit the enemy in the Info War.
[01:03:41.571 --> 01:03:46.374]  We've got to be the shock troops, folks, or it's over.
[01:03:47.075 --> 01:03:49.817]  And I'm honored to be a shock troop in the fight for humanity.
[01:03:52.077 --> 01:03:58.365]  Maka is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[01:03:58.745 --> 01:04:02.830]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:10.539]  Only recently has science discovered that Maka is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[01:04:11.079 --> 01:04:18.427]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[01:04:18.787 --> 01:04:21.030]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:24.634]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[01:04:25.014 --> 01:04:28.157]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[01:04:28.478 --> 01:04:31.381]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[01:04:31.861 --> 01:04:36.987]  Get your mock-up from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match.
[01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:40.091]  Because we get our mock-up fresh from the growers in Peru.
[01:04:40.471 --> 01:04:41.973]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings.
[01:04:42.033 --> 01:04:43.775]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com
[01:04:52.193 --> 01:04:55.076]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:04:55.436 --> 01:04:58.299]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:04:58.539 --> 01:05:04.744]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:12.431]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:05:12.611 --> 01:05:16.675]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[01:05:16.975 --> 01:05:22.497]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[01:05:22.717 --> 01:05:35.842]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[01:05:36.022 --> 01:05:39.823]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places U.S.A.
[01:05:40.043 --> 01:05:44.305]  now for only $29, plus shipping and handling, by calling New Millennium
[01:05:45.966 --> 01:05:59.677]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:05:59.918 --> 01:06:04.662]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:06:04.882 --> 01:06:10.547]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:06:10.947 --> 01:06:11.507]  We're good to go.
[01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:42.341]  Now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:42.361 --> 01:06:42.822]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:42.902 --> 01:06:46.765]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:46.785 --> 01:06:47.285]  We had scheduled
[01:07:06.096 --> 01:07:16.959]  A member of the American Friends Service Committee who received a surprise visit from the FBI at her home, Sarah Bradwell, and we posted it on the website.
[01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:18.960]  I'm sure somebody called him and warned him not to come on.
[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:20.821]  I mean, I wasn't going to attack him.
[01:07:20.861 --> 01:07:22.961]  I don't agree with what the Quakers are up to.
[01:07:23.021 --> 01:07:27.163]  I mean, you talk about communist folks.
[01:07:27.663 --> 01:07:28.543]  You're looking at it.
[01:07:29.443 --> 01:07:34.385]  But the point here is, is mainly they're a bunch of useful idiot bleeding hearts, because I know some of them here in Austin.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.082]  But regardless, why are they getting visits from the FBI?
[01:07:38.702 --> 01:07:49.828]  And I wanted to ask the Quakers, you know, you guys didn't defend the Patriot Movement when Bill Clinton had the FBI crawling all over us for absolutely no reason, and, you know, the FBI and BATF burying pipe bombs in people's backyards.
[01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:54.071]  They were caught doing that, by the way, to frame the population.
[01:07:54.911 --> 01:07:57.693]  But I will defend your First Amendment and expose what's happening.
[01:07:57.713 --> 01:08:02.556]  I mean, we've got Green Party members that can't get on airplanes, no criminal records, 60-year-old women,
[01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:04.332]  On the no-fly list.
[01:08:04.352 --> 01:08:08.313]  We've got land rights activists, conservatives who can't fly.
[01:08:08.333 --> 01:08:11.595]  And if we let this happen to anybody, it's going to happen to everyone.
[01:08:12.575 --> 01:08:24.461]  It's like the left wants to have preachers arrested if they read out of the Old Testament criticizing homosexuality, but they don't want to have their protesters locked up in cages, inside cages, underneath bus stations.
[01:08:25.061 --> 01:08:32.445]  Or out on the side of the street, you try to protest George Bush with his 500 pro-Bush supporters, and you get arrested.
[01:08:33.638 --> 01:08:35.979]  And then they give you a felony conviction for it.
[01:08:36.019 --> 01:08:37.380]  I mean, how is that America?
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.981]  So we'd better all hang together or we'll hang separate.
[01:08:41.281 --> 01:08:46.263]  We'd better, all of us, defend the First Amendment, even if you disagree with what somebody's saying.
[01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:51.925]  But this attitude of there being no First Amendment is sweeping the country right now.
[01:08:51.945 --> 01:09:00.269]  I mean, even here in Austin, Texas, the new AXS TV board, in their own minutes, says, well, we can't have speech anymore that criticizes other groups because that hurts their feelings.
[01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:04.090]  Well, you know, you're free to speak as long as you don't hurt someone's feelings.
[01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:06.031]  I mean, this is the new attitude.
[01:09:06.091 --> 01:09:10.093]  I even hear this from supposed conservative broadcasters that are out there.
[01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:11.293]  So 1-800-259-9231.
[01:09:11.373 --> 01:09:19.257]  I wanted to get Sarah Bardwell on, and we'll see if we're able to get her.
[01:09:19.317 --> 01:09:24.059]  I rarely have guests drop out on us, but usually it is the leftists who do that.
[01:09:25.019 --> 01:09:25.640]  So that's fine.
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.281]  But we've got Paul Watson with us.
[01:09:29.395 --> 01:09:51.640]  And we're about to go back to your calls, but Paul, do you have any comments about anarchists, conservatives, liberals, pinkos, across the board, getting government visits, professors being arrested who have no criminal records, who are white guys because they put on an art display with Petri dishes, you know, at the college art display to illustrate the dangers of genetically modified foods.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:54.821]  You know, a little science project to illustrate the dangers.
[01:09:54.881 --> 01:09:57.582]  They get arrested and charged with the Patriot Act.
[01:09:57.642 --> 01:09:58.042]  Comments?
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:12.430]  Well, it is hideous to contemplate that we're really at the stage where, you know, kids who wear anti-bush t-shirts get a knock on the door from the Secret Service, and the students who grasp them up get rewarded by the principal of the school.
[01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:14.291]  And we've got many examples.
[01:10:14.351 --> 01:10:19.855]  I mean, the guy who hung an upside-down American flag in his backyard, his neighbours called the police.
[01:10:20.695 --> 01:10:21.456]  And then on the left,
[01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:26.578]  The anti-war activist in Auckland who sent an email to the U.S.
[01:10:26.638 --> 01:10:31.701]  Embassy protesting the Iraq War was charged with misuse of a telephone.
[01:10:33.081 --> 01:10:43.006]  You know, people like the young child who did a research paper, the 12-year-old, and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge got a visit from the Joint Terrorist Task Force.
[01:10:43.467 --> 01:10:46.548]  So it's across the political spectrum that this is taking place.
[01:10:46.588 --> 01:10:49.930]  Well also, that university there in San Francisco,
[01:10:50.993 --> 01:10:51.833]  You know, white guy.
[01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:53.054]  Imagine if you were an Arab.
[01:10:53.894 --> 01:11:05.217]  He's in the architecture class, and they hand out the architecture lesson, and they're to go out and sketch four bridges, and so he goes out and does it.
[01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:08.298]  Folks, I had art classes where we had to do that.
[01:11:08.758 --> 01:11:12.139]  Go sketch architecture, and they come and grab him and question him.
[01:11:12.179 --> 01:11:13.679]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:11:14.955 --> 01:11:20.544]  Yeah, I mean people who refuse to wear, to remove, you know, anti-war t-shirts in a shopping mall are arrested.
[01:11:21.005 --> 01:11:21.806]  It's down the line.
[01:11:21.826 --> 01:11:28.657]  But on the left-right point, the rhetoric at the moment is against people like Muslims and homosexuals.
[01:11:29.944 --> 01:11:36.388]  If Kerry gets in, the rhetoric will switch to be directed against people like pro-lifers and gun rights activists.
[01:11:36.428 --> 01:11:38.950]  But the bottom line is that the movement will be the same.
[01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:50.076]  And yet now you have people like Bill Clinton out on talk show circuits bashing the Republicans while in every public meeting he's pictured hugging and laughing with Bush Junior and Senior.
[01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:57.481]  So, um, the rhetoric will shift and then the left-wingers will overwhelmingly get behind it if Kerry gets in.
[01:11:57.542 --> 01:12:01.545]  So, I mean, we're pointing out that it's wrong right across the political spectrum.
[01:12:01.705 --> 01:12:18.918]  Well, also, you know, I listen to the Genesis Network all the time, and I'm about to go to your calls, but I, you know, I never make comments about other shows, but there's a veterans program on on the weekend that I think is a great show, and I've been a supporter of it, but they had some guests on
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:26.105]  And I heard him out of his mouth say, John Kerry, you know, is a pure evil, big liar, which is true.
[01:12:26.526 --> 01:12:30.729]  Then he said, and I think George Bush is incapable of telling a lie.
[01:12:31.670 --> 01:12:33.692]  And I almost called in, but I didn't waste my time.
[01:12:33.712 --> 01:12:41.259]  I mean, I wanted to call in and go, he said the biggest amnesty in history isn't an amnesty where they're going to pay to bring the illegals here.
[01:12:41.579 --> 01:12:43.921]  That was in the Washington Times again on Thursday.
[01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.850]  Of last week.
[01:12:47.631 --> 01:12:49.452]  I mean, he's done nothing but lie.
[01:12:50.112 --> 01:12:51.834]  Hundreds of giant lies.
[01:12:51.854 --> 01:12:59.879]  And here are conservatives, I mean, people I've listened to and heard who know Bush is corrupt and know he's doing all these bad things to the veterans.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.343]  Suddenly, you know, kind of this group think, oh, we can't let Kerry win, we've got to get behind Bush.
[01:13:06.013 --> 01:13:07.496]  That's all psychological.
[01:13:07.576 --> 01:13:09.540]  You don't have a dog in this hunt, folks.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:10.501]  You don't have a choice.
[01:13:10.762 --> 01:13:17.214]  They're going to put in who they want, but they want you to feel like you do and be part of this polarization process.
[01:13:17.254 --> 01:13:18.256]  Can you speak to that, Paul?
[01:13:19.082 --> 01:13:28.708]  Well, yeah, it's like a sports-like mentality whereby someone will get behind their team and support their team all the way, even if they lose a game every week.
[01:13:28.768 --> 01:13:35.312]  So if Bush lies every week, then they're still going to support Bush because they've boiled politics down to that sports mentality.
[01:13:35.352 --> 01:13:40.536]  But the guest said, and I want to get his name and get him on, I was driving down the road and didn't have a pen,
[01:13:41.736 --> 01:13:49.179]  The guest said, just all worshiping Bush, and Bush is so godly, Bush is so good, he is incapable of telling a lie.
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.141]  Everybody else is capable of it, and are sinners, but not Bush.
[01:13:53.481 --> 01:13:57.983]  And I hear more and more of this talk about where he's almost a god or something.
[01:13:59.355 --> 01:14:07.842]  Yeah, because he throws out the fake godly Jesus-like rhetoric, which then people pick up on, while at the same time he's visiting Bohemian Grove.
[01:14:08.302 --> 01:14:21.113]  So, I mean, it's amazing that they will do that, but as you've said many times in the past, people associate their power with their identified leader, and so then they're not going to go against them, you know, in any short-term
[01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:49.561]  situation so that's the situation and it's hard to wake these people up but we need to point out the evidence point out the fact that Bush does lie every week but he's simply reading off a script and reading badly off a script in many cases and point out to them that both the left and the right it's all about rhetoric the agenda remains the same to restrict rights to create a police state a surveillance society while launching wars abroad and I mean the wars coming to our shores so we need to point out that
[01:14:50.061 --> 01:14:51.822]  It's all rhetoric and no action.
[01:14:51.902 --> 01:14:54.704]  It's the same movement from both sides of the equation.
[01:14:57.665 --> 01:14:58.226]  It is, Paul.
[01:14:58.246 --> 01:14:59.326]  You're absolutely right.
[01:14:59.466 --> 01:15:05.510]  And my point is that six months ago, a lot of conservatives were really waking up the Bush.
[01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:14.394]  And now, even some of those people I know are going, yeah, I know he's bad, but Kerry... Folks, again, there is no election.
[01:15:14.455 --> 01:15:14.995]  I'm telling you.
[01:15:15.075 --> 01:15:16.075]  It's a staged event.
[01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:16.776]  They're cousins.
[01:15:18.283 --> 01:15:19.745]  They meet behind closed doors.
[01:15:19.785 --> 01:15:22.668]  This whole thing is staged.
[01:15:23.308 --> 01:15:28.613]  But psychologically it is meant to create that separation in your mind so you think you have a choice.
[01:15:30.195 --> 01:15:36.742]  Yeah, it goes back to the old Hobson's choice thing where they set up two phony choices and people think that that is choice.
[01:15:38.724 --> 01:15:48.046]  I mean, people will back Bush all the way, but when Kerry gets in, which he probably will, I think the rhetoric will shift against conservatives for the first few months of his presidency.
[01:15:48.426 --> 01:15:53.587]  Then you'll see some kind of attack, and then all the conservatives will rally back behind Kerry.
[01:15:53.747 --> 01:15:57.668]  And then you'll hear Fox News going, hard to believe, but we've actually got us aboard him.
[01:15:57.688 --> 01:15:58.628]  He's gotten tough.
[01:15:58.668 --> 01:16:01.029]  This president has transformed himself.
[01:16:01.744 --> 01:16:07.590]  Yeah, because they'll roll out the phony patriotism, which is America needs to unite, and it's not about allegiance to America.
[01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:12.315]  And then the neocons will actually sit there in their armchairs and go, man, I actually like him.
[01:16:13.096 --> 01:16:14.297]  Can't believe I'm saying it.
[01:16:14.998 --> 01:16:21.804]  It's about allegiance to the establishment, no matter which party is in charge, and that's exactly what fear creates.
[01:16:21.824 --> 01:16:28.649]  It's about uniting America behind the government, not behind America or the ideals of the founders, or what America stands for.
[01:16:28.689 --> 01:16:32.613]  It's about uniting America behind the New World Order, whoever's in charge.
[01:16:32.633 --> 01:16:35.295]  It's the same policies that get passed each time.
[01:16:35.555 --> 01:16:36.015]  That's right.
[01:16:36.056 --> 01:16:36.736]  Let's go to calls.
[01:16:36.756 --> 01:16:39.218]  I'm going to go to your calls quick after the break, but let's go ahead and start now.
[01:16:39.258 --> 01:16:40.159]  Who's up first, Stephanie?
[01:16:41.343 --> 01:16:42.624]  Manuel in Pennsylvania.
[01:16:42.644 --> 01:16:43.184]  Welcome, sir.
[01:16:43.485 --> 01:16:44.165]  How you doing, Adam?
[01:16:44.565 --> 01:16:45.126]  Good, my friend.
[01:16:45.526 --> 01:16:48.148]  Okay, now you talk about being vocal out there and up front.
[01:16:49.049 --> 01:16:51.531]  When Emperor Bush came to town, we were able to protest him.
[01:16:52.091 --> 01:16:53.892]  Media coverage was deplorable, of course.
[01:16:53.952 --> 01:16:56.935]  We did line the whole Expo Center, right up to the fringe where he was.
[01:16:56.955 --> 01:17:01.418]  Of course, we don't get nowhere near his secure perimeter, but we were out there in the public eye.
[01:17:02.559 --> 01:17:09.564]  His reception by the general public was, at best, lukewarm, although the media had a picture with a caption, York hails the chief,
[01:17:10.353 --> 01:17:15.036]  With a picture of a youthful idiot painting on the storefront something to the likes of Welcome Bush.
[01:17:15.536 --> 01:17:16.717]  Although we were able to get out there.
[01:17:17.137 --> 01:17:17.677]  No, I know.
[01:17:17.797 --> 01:17:26.943]  I've actually been at protests where there's, you know, a thousand people protesting somebody and there's twenty people there for him and the news will have the front page to twenty people.
[01:17:27.403 --> 01:17:28.503]  Well, nobody wanted to go see him.
[01:17:28.524 --> 01:17:32.666]  They had actually let people rush in through the gates at the last minute because no security checks.
[01:17:32.906 --> 01:17:36.748]  Because actually, nobody was able to go, nobody actually wanted to go see him and buy tickets.
[01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:39.630]  We also had Chief Moose come down here and we confronted him.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:46.604]  He was with our new big-wig West Point graduate commissioner touting some police state policies, telling us all to go to sleep.
[01:17:47.105 --> 01:18:04.936]  But my third point, the biggest point, Ann Coulter's extra-militant protege, Michelle Malkin, is now touting a new book where she's calling for civil internment and concentration camps for those who can potentially be deemed terrorists, even if they're American citizens, right here in Oklahoma.
[01:18:04.976 --> 01:18:07.858]  Yeah, I want to get Malkin on, and the folks can email me.
[01:18:07.878 --> 01:18:08.198]  Guess what?
[01:18:10.063 --> 01:18:16.627]  On our local radio show, WSBA here in Central PA, and I will be confronting her also on the airwaves, and I'll make sure a couple of my friends do.
[01:18:16.667 --> 01:18:18.648]  We'll run her off the air like she's never seen before.
[01:18:18.788 --> 01:18:20.049]  Is she the Chinese lady?
[01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:22.231]  He is of Asian descent.
[01:18:22.311 --> 01:18:25.973]  Yeah, I mean, and I've heard about this.
[01:18:26.653 --> 01:18:28.875]  She's out touting putting people in camps now.
[01:18:29.755 --> 01:18:31.136]  Also, Michael Medved.
[01:18:31.216 --> 01:18:32.957]  Manuel, you need to stay there.
[01:18:32.997 --> 01:18:33.938]  We'll come back to you, okay?
[01:18:35.645 --> 01:18:37.666]  I want to hear exactly what you heard her touting.
[01:18:37.986 --> 01:18:41.807]  The loving camps, the freedom, you disagree with the government, you hate terrorists, you should go to a camp.
[01:18:42.227 --> 01:18:49.390]  They're all starting to talk like this because we're beating them with the truth and they can't stand it and they want to be concentration camp gods.
[01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:55.607]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:18:55.867 --> 01:18:59.368]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:03.410]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:09.793]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:19:10.213 --> 01:19:18.117]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:19:18.477 --> 01:19:18.898]  I think so.

[01:19:50.954 --> 01:19:52.476]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:19:52.636 --> 01:19:53.778]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:19:53.958 --> 01:19:57.383]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:19:57.483 --> 01:19:57.903]  Phenol!
[01:19:58.224 --> 01:20:05.293]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:20:05.854 --> 01:20:09.738]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:10.298]  Fragrance?
[01:20:10.659 --> 01:20:15.423]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:20:15.563 --> 01:20:20.268]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:20:20.488 --> 01:20:23.031]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[01:20:23.291 --> 01:20:26.694]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:20:26.854 --> 01:20:30.378]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.282]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:20:54.787 --> 01:20:58.208]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:20:58.708 --> 01:20:59.369]  Let's update.
[01:20:59.889 --> 01:21:03.650]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:07.712]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:21:08.392 --> 01:21:09.352]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:21:09.372 --> 01:21:11.713]  dollar was worth 17% more than a Euro.
[01:21:12.213 --> 01:21:13.133]  Today, the U.S.
[01:21:13.154 --> 01:21:15.374]  dollar is worth 28% less than a Euro.
[01:21:15.774 --> 01:21:17.275]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:21:17.879 --> 01:21:19.862]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[01:21:21.204 --> 01:21:26.091]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:21:27.072 --> 01:21:29.235]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:32.159]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:21:32.819 --> 01:21:34.201]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:21:34.621 --> 01:21:36.364]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:21:36.764 --> 01:21:38.727]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:21:39.147 --> 01:21:41.250]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:21:43.433 --> 01:21:45.596]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.

[01:21:53.427 --> 01:21:57.049]  Well, here's some great news that can save you time and money.

[01:22:39.147 --> 01:22:39.187]  800-419-2335.
[01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:59.936]  We've had torture introduced into our psyche is a good thing.
[01:23:00.016 --> 01:23:02.657]  We've had arresting anyone that disagrees with the government.
[01:23:03.458 --> 01:23:18.486]  Never forget, almost two years ago, they had the Deputy Attorney General in California, Calhoun, in the Oakland Tribune going, we may ban anti-war protests because protesting the war aids terrorists, we may arrest you.
[01:23:19.526 --> 01:23:29.710]  And then they have the neocons out doing it, and yeah, Michelle Malkin, you know, I agree with her on some issues, but then all of a sudden she gets even more hardcore than Coulter, and I have heard about her new book.
[01:23:29.730 --> 01:23:37.712]  We're going to try to get her on, but talking to Manuel, Manuel, you heard her talk about the camps, and what did she say?
[01:23:37.732 --> 01:23:42.174]  And of course, since she's a person of, quote, color, she's going to be their little poster child.
[01:23:42.354 --> 01:23:43.374]  See, I love the camps.
[01:23:43.434 --> 01:23:45.515]  It's not just for people of color, it's for everyone.
[01:23:46.655 --> 01:23:47.236]  Tell us about it.
[01:23:47.476 --> 01:23:48.356]  Well, after she had this
[01:23:48.925 --> 01:23:52.286]  Her veneer of legitimacy, as you said, you've agreed with her on certain issues.
[01:23:52.666 --> 01:23:56.628]  Now she's exposing her more brazen and anti-American attitudes and philosophies.
[01:23:57.168 --> 01:24:07.952]  So now she brings up the fact that, just because you may be an American citizen, that no longer keeps you safe from patriotic, uh, subsections, which we already knew, but now it's being thrown out there.
[01:24:07.972 --> 01:24:12.033]  And she said we too should be put in concentration camps because, hey, it's a new day, folks.
[01:24:12.093 --> 01:24:14.194]  Now did she say concentration camps or camps?
[01:24:14.534 --> 01:24:15.834]  She said internment camps.
[01:24:16.135 --> 01:24:16.375]  Yeah.
[01:24:16.795 --> 01:24:17.275]  And also,
[01:24:17.662 --> 01:24:19.803]  This all started, sir, with Michael Medved.
[01:24:20.284 --> 01:24:33.412]  About two years ago, I was hearing a repeat broadcast, first time I had ever heard the show, where he said that everybody that was at that, of course it was a left-wing, pretty communist-organized rally down in D.C., hundreds of thousands, against the war.
[01:24:33.432 --> 01:24:39.456]  He said they're all potential terrorists, and Homeland Security should direct all their focus and energy on them.
[01:24:39.536 --> 01:24:46.501]  Yeah, he said the same thing about me, and of course it's not going to be on the commies, it's going to be on the patriots.
[01:24:46.541 --> 01:24:47.101]  Thanks for the call.
[01:24:48.536 --> 01:24:51.912]  Paul, quick comment on that before we go to Fred and Eric and George and Paul.
[01:24:52.614 --> 01:25:02.157]  Well, yes, it's universally agreed now that the internment of the Japanese-Americans was wrong and, you know, that was during World War II when there was at least a semblance of a threat.
[01:25:02.538 --> 01:25:07.119]  But now, the justification for it does not exist.
[01:25:07.179 --> 01:25:17.263]  I mean, like this reporter who got a job at the Olympics with no questions asked and then spent the opening ceremony planting packages everywhere with a name tag which said Robert Bin Laden.
[01:25:17.643 --> 01:25:20.884]  I mean, none of this security is to stop terrorists.
[01:25:21.414 --> 01:25:36.217]  If there really were these roaming groups of terrorists who were determined to attack at the levels to which the government scare money... They would shut down the borders and start deporting anybody questionably who was here illegally or had... or who had, you know, not signed their name correctly.
[01:25:36.832 --> 01:25:40.294]  Yeah, and on the same level, you'd see small-scale attacks every day.
[01:25:40.354 --> 01:25:45.216]  If there were supposed Al-Qaeda cells all over America, you know, it would be worse than Israel.
[01:25:45.416 --> 01:25:47.117]  Yeah, we see the Israeli model, yeah.
[01:25:47.597 --> 01:25:59.302]  Somebody could, you know, put a log on a train track, kill dozens of people, and call it a terrorist attack, but that doesn't happen, because there are no terrorists, and the security police state is only designed to affect your life.
[01:25:59.342 --> 01:26:05.685]  There's nothing really to defend against, albeit there is from outside the borders, which is why the borders are wide open.
[01:26:06.969 --> 01:26:08.090]  Fred in Philadelphia.
[01:26:08.110 --> 01:26:08.691]  Welcome, sir.
[01:26:09.151 --> 01:26:09.492]  Alex.
[01:26:09.832 --> 01:26:10.973]  Yes.
[01:26:11.093 --> 01:26:18.180]  Let me bring up, first of all, I want to endorse Mike and his efforts in Greeley, Colorado.
[01:26:19.361 --> 01:26:30.493]  The Bill of Rights Defense Committee is one of the organizations that is correct in getting the facts and in fighting Patriot 2.
[01:26:33.022 --> 01:26:37.104]  I would like to get in touch with Mike and Manuel to be honest with you.
[01:26:37.144 --> 01:26:40.987]  I think that they're the kind of people that we need to network with.
[01:26:42.188 --> 01:26:49.152]  I want to bring up SAIC, that Scientific Applications International Corporation.
[01:26:50.133 --> 01:27:00.420]  This is a extremely powerful employee-owned CIA front and they are
[01:27:01.144 --> 01:27:04.998]  Now, and have been since about, oh, I would say 03 or 02.
[01:27:07.037 --> 01:27:11.818]  In charge of the uh... certification for the election, the deponey elections.
[01:27:11.918 --> 01:27:12.518]  No, I know.
[01:27:12.918 --> 01:27:16.859]  Look, Bush appoints this new commission, gives them almost five billion dollars.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.340]  They recommend preparing to suspend the election.
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:23.461]  They recommend all the electronic voting machines try to force the states to take them.
[01:27:23.501 --> 01:27:27.542]  Then the people that are overseeing the elections are known CIA-controlled fronts.
[01:27:28.002 --> 01:27:32.583]  Of the five big election companies, three of them are run by former heads or deputy heads of the CIA.
[01:27:32.863 --> 01:27:34.764]  The other is run by the former head of the NSA.
[01:27:35.524 --> 01:27:38.575]  I mean, and their own employees quit and say it's all a fraud.
[01:27:38.595 --> 01:27:40.883]  I mean, it's so transparent, Paul.
[01:27:42.694 --> 01:27:49.580]  It's about, as I've said before, making people think that voting is a privilege handed down to them by government.
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:28:03.332]  And any God-given right that we already have is a privilege handed down to them by government, which means, obviously at the same time, that government can take away that privilege at any point, which is why they then talk about cancelling the election.
[01:28:03.693 --> 01:28:05.575]  And martial law and all the rest of it.
[01:28:07.396 --> 01:28:14.581]  Well, did you, I mean, Joyce has mentioned this about the Chuck Hagel election, 96 in 2002.
[01:28:15.481 --> 01:28:22.366]  What, briefly, basically, was that a good example or an infamous example of some sort of
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:26.721]  His total votes just rising suddenly at the end.
[01:28:26.821 --> 01:28:27.702]  Did you know about that?
[01:28:27.742 --> 01:28:28.202]  Yeah, sure.
[01:28:28.242 --> 01:28:29.242]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:28:29.282 --> 01:28:29.822]  Thanks, Fred.
[01:28:30.262 --> 01:28:34.364]  Yeah, Chuck Hagel owned the voting machines that 80% of the people cast ballots on for him.
[01:28:34.804 --> 01:28:35.744]  This is the new America.
[01:28:36.184 --> 01:28:38.065]  You own the voting machines, then you're elected.
[01:28:38.085 --> 01:28:38.685]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:42.387 --> 01:28:43.287]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.767 --> 01:28:45.388]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.288 --> 01:28:48.949]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.111 --> 01:29:00.596]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:01.017 --> 01:29:05.261]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:05.481 --> 01:29:12.528]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:12.908 --> 01:29:19.014]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:19.154 --> 01:29:20.375]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:20.695 --> 01:29:23.659]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.842]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:26.143 --> 01:29:33.373]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:33.673 --> 01:29:37.078]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:30:00.288 --> 01:30:11.194]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:11.374 --> 01:30:11.774]  We're good to go!
[01:30:27.953 --> 01:30:28.453]  That's right!

[01:30:53.226 --> 01:30:54.928]  Do you recognize any of these names?
[01:30:55.068 --> 01:30:58.090]  Jungle Joe, Spike, Burma Queen, Cher Ami, or G.I.
[01:30:58.130 --> 01:30:58.430]  Joe?
[01:30:58.691 --> 01:31:01.193]  If you guessed they're all American heroes, you guessed right!
[01:31:01.493 --> 01:31:04.656]  But these heroes don't belong to any crack military commando unit.
[01:31:04.816 --> 01:31:07.518]  These true American heroes are American Homing Pigeons.
[01:31:07.959 --> 01:31:11.141]  That's right, registered pedigreed American Homing Pigeons.
[01:31:11.382 --> 01:31:18.888]  Although the Homing Pigeon no longer delivers life-saving messages on the battlefield, they are engaged throughout the world at thoroughbreds and exciting racing contests
[01:31:19.028 --> 01:31:23.092]  Who races pigeons?
[01:31:23.372 --> 01:31:24.333]  Anybody and everybody!
[01:31:24.553 --> 01:31:27.136]  There's no age limit to the excitement of pigeon racing.
[01:31:27.276 --> 01:31:31.740]  All it takes to get involved with this great sport is to call the American Racing Pigeon Union, toll free, 800-755-ARPU.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:32.261]  That's 800-755-ARPU.
[01:31:38.266 --> 01:31:41.368]  The American Racing Pigeon Union has clubs in every state in the U.S.
[01:31:41.528 --> 01:31:45.451]  For a great family sport and fun in your own backyard, call the ARPU today.
[01:31:45.471 --> 01:31:51.135]  800-755-ARPU or visit pigeons.org on the World Wide Web.
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:00.021]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:00.502 --> 01:32:03.344]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:06.986 --> 01:32:07.687]  Pick an issue.
[01:32:09.022 --> 01:32:10.263]  I mean corporate fraud.
[01:32:13.985 --> 01:32:20.688]  The so-called privatization movement is nothing but corporations owning government looting what has been built up with tax money.
[01:32:20.828 --> 01:32:24.210]  Take the trillions of dollars that have been stolen by the federal government.
[01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:31.594]  A trillion two alone in the last eight, now nine years is a minor story in the back of the newspaper.
[01:32:32.554 --> 01:32:36.376]  The FBI and myriad of police departments being caught
[01:32:37.845 --> 01:32:40.606]  Framing people in an industrialized scale.
[01:32:42.346 --> 01:32:44.767]  The court system certifying those frauds.
[01:32:45.327 --> 01:32:46.167]  The crime labs.
[01:32:46.367 --> 01:32:46.747]  All of it.
[01:32:47.427 --> 01:32:48.448]  I mean, take an issue.
[01:32:48.928 --> 01:32:55.950]  Open discussion of martial law, suspending elections, putting people in camps every day on TV and radio and in the newspaper.
[01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.950]  I mean, this is sick!
[01:32:58.317 --> 01:33:04.843]  This is sick, and we're about to go back to Paul Watson, and then we'll let him answer Fred's question, then Eric, George, Paul, Rodney, and others.
[01:33:05.343 --> 01:33:07.865]  But here for the next few minutes, Debbie Morrow joins us.
[01:33:08.806 --> 01:33:15.052]  The horrible hurricane hit Florida, killed some people, but not huge numbers like it's been in the past, thank God.
[01:33:15.172 --> 01:33:16.813]  Devastated billions of dollars.
[01:33:16.833 --> 01:33:22.058]  They're saying some areas may be without power for two weeks, maybe even a month in some cases.
[01:33:23.579 --> 01:33:25.161]  And it's just horrific.
[01:33:25.641 --> 01:33:27.723]  And this is why we tell people to get prepared.
[01:33:28.083 --> 01:33:36.530]  But number one with water filtration, just stop drinking the water to begin with because of all the toxins and chemicals and garbage and pathogens that are in the water.
[01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:39.532]  But Debbie, you're joining us here for the next few minutes.
[01:33:39.572 --> 01:33:49.881]  I appreciate you coming on because you're going to offer a special to those in Florida or around Florida or areas that were hit who were having problems getting water.
[01:33:52.243 --> 01:33:52.463]  Debbie?
[01:33:52.694 --> 01:33:52.874]  Yes.
[01:33:52.914 --> 01:33:53.955]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:33:54.035 --> 01:33:54.455]  Hello.
[01:33:54.716 --> 01:33:54.936]  Hi.
[01:33:55.116 --> 01:33:55.837]  Can you hear me okay?
[01:33:55.857 --> 01:33:56.177]  Yes, I can.
[01:33:56.557 --> 01:33:56.958]  Oh, good.
[01:33:57.338 --> 01:34:09.908]  Yes, I was talking to Jim about it this morning when I was looking at the news releases about how many people are without water, without electricity.
[01:34:10.469 --> 01:34:15.453]  People are spending hours in line to get a bag of ice, to get a bottle of water.
[01:34:15.473 --> 01:34:16.674]  They're in shelters.
[01:34:18.210 --> 01:34:21.772]  And it's, you know, not only in Florida, but at the East Coast.
[01:34:22.032 --> 01:34:28.356]  So what we'd like to do, if I had my druthers, I would drive a truck full and just give them away.
[01:34:28.456 --> 01:34:30.557]  But unfortunately, I'm not in that position.
[01:34:30.577 --> 01:34:39.782]  So what we'd like to do is make it available to overnight water filter systems to anyone who needs them immediately.
[01:34:39.802 --> 01:34:45.545]  If they, you know, have a friend or relative call in to place an order for them.
[01:34:46.095 --> 01:34:57.281]  Or if they're able to, I've already had a few customers who do listen to you, Alex, from Puerto Gorda, Florida, and they said that, you know, they're using their cell phones.
[01:34:57.321 --> 01:35:04.585]  Their cell phones are the only communication they have out, and they placed orders to have systems overnighted to them.
[01:35:04.605 --> 01:35:10.208]  They're not even sure yet if UPS will be able to get there, but they want to, you know, get it on the way.
[01:35:10.228 --> 01:35:13.190]  So, the special that we would offer for them
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:27.105]  And anyone who needs this rushed out to them would be, instead of charging extra for the overnight charge, we'll just do our normal shipping charge, which is $18, and we'll get them out today.
[01:35:27.125 --> 01:35:30.286]  Unless it's late in the day, then it would be tomorrow.
[01:35:30.486 --> 01:35:31.507]  Well, what's the overnight?
[01:35:31.547 --> 01:35:33.387]  I mean, I think an overnight is something that would be like $60.
[01:35:33.527 --> 01:35:34.528]  It would be.
[01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:37.229]  It would be about $60 to overnight express.
[01:35:37.249 --> 01:35:42.751]  So that's about a $40 discount, and people need to stop procrastinating, period.
[01:35:43.622 --> 01:35:47.967]  Uh, bottom line, you gotta have water, and the water you're drinking is so toxic.
[01:35:48.427 --> 01:36:02.681]  And then routinely, every day, I see articles around the country where they say boil your water for a week, it's got all these bacteria in it, and they always find out after a couple hundred people get deathly ill, or in some cases, uh, even die, uh, from the stuff that's in the water.
[01:36:02.961 --> 01:36:04.763]  So give Debbie a call, 1-triple-8,
[01:36:06.704 --> 01:36:07.224]  803-4438.
[01:36:07.984 --> 01:36:09.345]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[01:36:09.365 --> 01:36:16.707]  And if the phone's busy, leave your name and number.
[01:36:16.727 --> 01:36:19.987]  She'll call you right back.
[01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:20.908]  808-803-4438.
[01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:22.608]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[01:36:22.628 --> 01:36:23.408]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:36:23.808 --> 01:36:24.068]  You bet.
[01:36:24.108 --> 01:36:24.829]  Good to hear from you.
[01:36:24.949 --> 01:36:26.649]  I know they sent out several hundred filters.
[01:36:27.646 --> 01:36:49.963]  uh... to uh... the uh... troops for the war and then of course they had trouble even getting a stone uh... our government likes to ship in the water via haliburton trucks all the way from kuwait and then it's very questionable on the troops get sick because haliburton makes more money that way instead of just giving them water filters but uh... just a side issue one triple eight eight oh three four four three eight
[01:36:51.505 --> 01:36:55.129]  Going back to Paul Watson, Fred raised the case of Chuck Hagel.
[01:36:55.569 --> 01:37:06.100]  Senator Hagel was behind 15 points in the polls, just like Michael McCaul here in Austin, Texas, who voted on machines that his father-in-law owns, the owner of Clear Channel, Hardin Recivics, a division of Clear Channel.
[01:37:07.862 --> 01:37:12.387]  We've got the case of Chuck Hagel, and he was wanting to ask you about that.
[01:37:12.407 --> 01:37:13.168]  Were you familiar with it?
[01:37:14.002 --> 01:37:15.564]  Not familiar with that case, no.
[01:37:16.065 --> 01:37:18.728]  Well, I am, and I already kind of mentioned in the last segment.
[01:37:19.409 --> 01:37:20.691]  He was way behind in the polls.
[01:37:21.171 --> 01:37:23.074]  The state hadn't gone Democrat in 20 years.
[01:37:23.094 --> 01:37:25.236]  I mean, hadn't gone Republican in 20 years.
[01:37:27.018 --> 01:37:28.140]  But he owns.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.662]  I mean, he's not a shareholder.
[01:37:29.722 --> 01:37:30.463]  He owned.
[01:37:30.983 --> 01:37:32.766]  He's now, quote, divested a part of it.
[01:37:33.546 --> 01:37:44.311]  In that election, he owned the machines that 80% of people in the state voted on, and then magically, Paul, despite the poll showing he was going to lose, it was a record landslide.
[01:37:45.331 --> 01:37:50.314]  Well, in a sense, they've got both bases covered, because they can just go ahead and cancel it anyway.
[01:37:50.754 --> 01:38:01.398]  I mean, we're told that terrorists seek to take measures to ensure the election is cancelled, and then the government says that they're considering cancelling the election, because terrorists seek to cancel the election.
[01:38:01.438 --> 01:38:02.399]  So what are they telling you?
[01:38:02.799 --> 01:38:03.900]  Well, we also, again, have in Najaf,
[01:38:25.301 --> 01:38:28.223]  This is mainstream news, London Telegraph, you name it.
[01:38:29.604 --> 01:38:50.435]  Our government is telling the reporters, we're going to kill you if you don't leave, and they give them a fake bomb threat to the hotel, and then our Iraqi security forces start machine gunning the building, and we have a whole section where our troops have been ordered to kill reporters, we're talking BBC, Associated Press folks, but no one's ever held accountable for this, and then meanwhile, the supposed terrorists come out and say, yeah, you better leave or we're going to kill you.
[01:38:51.595 --> 01:38:54.297]  So I wonder why our government and the terrorists are on the same page, Paul.
[01:38:55.359 --> 01:38:59.780]  Well, they are in every case, because they have the same goals, which is to eliminate freedom.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:07.502]  As Bush said, the terrorists attack us because they hate our freedom, and after the attack, the terrorists did indeed take away our freedom, so they're on the same page.
[01:39:09.863 --> 01:39:11.724]  Let's go to Eric in Tennessee.
[01:39:11.824 --> 01:39:12.684]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:39:12.724 --> 01:39:13.084]  Welcome.
[01:39:13.604 --> 01:39:14.364]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:39:14.404 --> 01:39:14.705]  Good.
[01:39:14.945 --> 01:39:15.545]  How you doing, Paul?
[01:39:15.845 --> 01:39:16.865]  Good.
[01:39:17.125 --> 01:39:19.986]  What I was calling about, first of all, I wanted to ask you a question, Alex.
[01:39:20.366 --> 01:39:23.327]  I sent that tape where Senator Grassley and Janet Reno
[01:39:23.826 --> 01:39:27.609]  Had that exchange about the military being involved in Waco and Ruby Ridge.
[01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:29.150]  I wondered if you had gotten it.
[01:39:29.250 --> 01:39:29.830]  I did get it.
[01:39:29.890 --> 01:39:32.352]  I want to thank you and every other listener that sends us videos.
[01:39:32.692 --> 01:39:33.933]  Okay, well you're more than welcome.
[01:39:34.293 --> 01:39:51.825]  What I want to bring up today to you and Paul was I've read this weekend more articles, especially in conservative newspapers and websites, that the Republican Convention, there's going to be hundreds of thousands of demonstrators come up and they're talking about it being like a Chicago 1968 and
[01:39:54.036 --> 01:40:02.859]  I've got just a terrible gut feeling that we might be seeing another Kent State or another Tiananmen Square develop at the end of this month.
[01:40:04.059 --> 01:40:05.759]  And I want to get y'all's opinion on that.
[01:40:05.799 --> 01:40:07.660]  Well, I'm strongly considering going.
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:08.680]  You are?
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:09.300]  Yes.
[01:40:10.181 --> 01:40:21.264]  Okay, because, I mean, I've read a few decent articles from WorldNetDaily in the past, but I'm getting worried about their bent and their opinion sometimes.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.721]  They're already demonizing it.
[01:40:23.901 --> 01:40:26.182]  It was an article from the 16th today.
[01:40:26.563 --> 01:40:30.004]  Will Republican Convention be a Chicago 68 madhouse?
[01:40:30.445 --> 01:40:35.448]  And in that, it's just a demonization of the leaders of different demonstration groups.
[01:40:36.028 --> 01:40:41.871]  That they're communists, that they're going to cause problems, that they're anarchists, and it's just going to get out of hand.
[01:40:42.571 --> 01:40:43.892]  Okay, let me stop you right there.
[01:40:45.353 --> 01:40:50.496]  In my film, The Takeover, we show the police, the newspaper, admitting that the Delta Force
[01:40:51.493 --> 01:40:53.134]  They controlled the anarchists.
[01:40:53.194 --> 01:40:53.975]  They hired them.
[01:40:54.495 --> 01:40:55.276]  They trained them.
[01:40:55.976 --> 01:40:56.397]  You saw it.
[01:40:56.797 --> 01:40:58.839]  They housed them in a government building.
[01:40:58.879 --> 01:41:02.361]  They were sent out to beat up cops, to burn trash cans.
[01:41:02.381 --> 01:41:04.483]  50 of them.
[01:41:04.503 --> 01:41:06.605]  50 bad guys, 50,000 good protesters.
[01:41:06.665 --> 01:41:09.166]  Farmers, ranchers, communists, conservatives, liberals.
[01:41:09.747 --> 01:41:15.211]  Everybody against the WTO, World Trade Organization, having more authority over our trade than our Congress.
[01:41:15.611 --> 01:41:15.812]  Right.
[01:41:16.172 --> 01:41:17.613]  Most averse protest I've ever seen.
[01:41:18.903 --> 01:41:23.085]  And then these 50 anarchists show up, and they openly hit cops in the head with bottles.
[01:41:23.125 --> 01:41:28.166]  I mean, there's video of them hitting cops, and the cops are ordered, which I should think would be an illegal order, to take it.
[01:41:29.167 --> 01:41:32.468]  I mean, I got cops hitting the ground, and they're told to stand there.
[01:41:33.078 --> 01:41:37.200]  Then those guys, after one day of that, the news shooting video, going, what's wrong with these cops?
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.101]  Why don't they do something?
[01:41:38.461 --> 01:41:52.368]  They pull back, are guarded by the police, this is on the news, in a government building, giving food and everything else, and then they turn towards the 50,000 who we have on video trying to fight the anarchists, people trying to stop them, going, you're a fed!
[01:41:52.408 --> 01:41:52.968]  What are you doing?
[01:41:53.468 --> 01:41:54.649]  These are agent revocateurs.
[01:41:54.749 --> 01:42:02.532]  The police then, mad because they had to sit there for a day, psychologically manipulated, and some cops were going, why do we protect the guys that did this, but now we're attacking the innocent?
[01:42:02.852 --> 01:42:11.015]  They're then released to savagely beat 75-year-old women with clubs, to savagely stomp on young women, to pull cars over randomly.
[01:42:11.235 --> 01:42:13.075]  Then they say, free speech is banned.
[01:42:14.156 --> 01:42:15.276]  No more free speech.
[01:42:15.336 --> 01:42:22.439]  In fact, Stephanie, in my commercial carts, there's an ad for police state to the takeover.
[01:42:23.568 --> 01:42:25.410]  Can you find that one and play that in a second?
[01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:30.374]  Because it's got some of the clips in it from local newscast folks and others admitting it.
[01:42:30.674 --> 01:42:35.758]  Then they put 500 peaceful people in the Sandpoint Naval Brig in a FEMA camp.
[01:42:36.379 --> 01:42:50.650]  So, then they took video from Seattle, and cops, you've seen this in your own police departments, the feds come and show it to you, but don't tell you they hired the thugs, and then you go out and they say, you gotta be tough on them, and then you're ordered to attack peaceful people.
[01:42:52.498 --> 01:43:00.004]  Now, whereas ten years ago you didn't have problems at protests, now everywhere the cops almost always attack people for absolutely no reason.
[01:43:00.044 --> 01:43:00.964]  So could this happen?
[01:43:01.645 --> 01:43:02.425]  Absolutely.
[01:43:02.465 --> 01:43:08.810]  It'll probably happen because there were going to be hundreds of thousands of people in Boston, just a few thousand showed up because they were afraid.
[01:43:10.291 --> 01:43:13.093]  I don't think anything can keep people from showing up at the Republican Convention.
[01:43:14.074 --> 01:43:15.855]  And will there be provocateurs?
[01:43:15.915 --> 01:43:18.677]  I've been right here in Austin four years ago at the Fortune 500 demonstration
[01:43:20.123 --> 01:43:27.168]  With only about 600 people, and here come cops in anarchist outfits starting fights, and I said, these are cops!
[01:43:27.569 --> 01:43:30.050]  And cops ran across the street and said, back off, Jones!
[01:43:31.251 --> 01:43:32.692]  And they had to admit that they were police.
[01:43:33.913 --> 01:43:37.576]  So, that's Paul's comments to what Eric just said.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:57.448]  There will be provocateurs because there was an interesting article in the New York Daily News a few weeks ago which said that anarchist groups are going to plant threatening notes on the New York subway to distract the police from focusing on the real protesters on the ground.
[01:43:57.888 --> 01:44:00.010]  So obviously that's not going to help their cause.
[01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:06.416]  It's a provocateur action because it's going to be a big fear-mongering tool whereby, you know, the subways keep getting searched.
[01:44:06.697 --> 01:44:08.498]  And then those guys aren't going to get busted.
[01:44:08.519 --> 01:44:10.100]  In some cases, they're police themselves.
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:11.421]  They're not going to get busted.
[01:44:11.782 --> 01:44:16.086]  It'll then be a zit-faced kid in Topeka, Kansas, and they'll arrest him on the news.
[01:44:16.706 --> 01:44:19.109]  Yeah, regarding whether there'll be an attack.
[01:44:19.838 --> 01:44:24.740]  As I've said before, I think you could take the example of when Bush came over to Britain.
[01:44:25.461 --> 01:44:32.164]  There were massive protests, but there was an attack in Turkey which kind of subdued the protest and reaffirmed his rhetoric.
[01:44:32.504 --> 01:44:40.327]  So it's more likely you'll see an attack abroad to reaffirm the rhetoric at the convention rather than an attack in New York.
[01:44:42.048 --> 01:44:43.649]  I tend to agree with you.
[01:44:44.429 --> 01:44:45.510]  Eric, thanks for the call.
[01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:47.090]  George in Canada.
[01:44:47.191 --> 01:44:48.091]  George, go ahead.
[01:44:49.397 --> 01:44:49.997]  Good day, Alex.
[01:44:50.218 --> 01:44:50.538]  Hello.
[01:44:50.638 --> 01:44:52.519]  Shakespeare said it long before we were here.
[01:44:52.699 --> 01:44:54.981]  The world's a stage and every actor plays his part.
[01:44:55.581 --> 01:44:58.603]  But the people who write the scripts, they really know how to party.
[01:44:58.963 --> 01:44:59.423]  They do.
[01:45:00.044 --> 01:45:10.470]  One thing I'd like to bring up, Alex, I was reading in the National Post something that was parroted in the New York Times yesterday, that the United States is going to start pulling troops out of Europe, Japan, and South Korea.
[01:45:10.751 --> 01:45:11.471]  Already starting.
[01:45:12.171 --> 01:45:13.652]  And, oh, of course, because they need them.
[01:45:13.672 --> 01:45:14.473]  They need them badly.
[01:45:14.847 --> 01:45:17.708]  Because there's a broader, wider war being planned, I'm sure.
[01:45:17.788 --> 01:45:22.971]  The timelines are probably a lie and a cover story that it's going to happen over the next three to four years.
[01:45:23.451 --> 01:45:27.152]  But I think you're going to see major, major events happening in the Middle East.
[01:45:27.613 --> 01:45:32.715]  There's been warnings from the President about Iran to stop their nuclear plutonium enrichment.
[01:45:32.735 --> 01:45:38.938]  Israel's saying that the plant is 90 plus percent done, and the moment it's done, or 95 percent, they're going to bomb it.
[01:45:39.798 --> 01:45:44.260]  And the Iranians say that they will fight for every last grain of sand and then some.
[01:45:44.656 --> 01:45:46.357]  So I expect a major conflict there.
[01:45:46.397 --> 01:45:47.977]  I would even put a timeline on this.
[01:45:48.017 --> 01:45:51.499]  I would expect it before the next election, because Mr. Bush has to do something.
[01:45:51.599 --> 01:45:52.339]  Well, I know this.
[01:45:52.439 --> 01:45:55.101]  We've got, uh... Well, Bush is a puppet.
[01:45:55.121 --> 01:45:57.742]  He'll do what he's told to do, but... Uh, we've got, uh...
[01:45:59.489 --> 01:46:03.550]  O'Reilly and all the neocons calling it World War III, World War IV.
[01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:04.730]  Get ready for it.
[01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:05.730]  Gotta have a draft.
[01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:06.430]  It's good.
[01:46:07.210 --> 01:46:14.612]  And look, if Bush is ordered to stand down by the Bildenbergs to put Kerry in because he can get more done now that they've double-teamed us, that'll happen.
[01:46:14.732 --> 01:46:22.893]  Unless there really is a Fisher in the New World Order, then we could see a terror attack by the Bush arm to try to keep him in office.
[01:46:22.933 --> 01:46:26.674]  But again, they control the voting machines and the new voting commission that put them in.
[01:46:27.294 --> 01:46:28.675]  So I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:46:28.895 --> 01:46:30.115]  Paul, what's your gut level?
[01:46:31.256 --> 01:46:42.359]  Well, it's interesting that obviously they're gearing up this attack on Iran because obviously Russia have supplied the majority of the nuclear components for Iran to develop that nuclear program.
[01:46:42.399 --> 01:46:52.323]  But at the same time, we have the BBC article which described the UK government's contribution to that same program and described it as a shopping blitz.
[01:46:54.424 --> 01:46:57.306]  Also, we've caught Israel selling components to Iran.
[01:46:57.366 --> 01:46:58.066]  Why would they do that?
[01:46:58.286 --> 01:46:59.787]  And then selling components, U.S.
[01:46:59.827 --> 01:47:02.989]  components, to China, who they know openly gives it to Iran.
[01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:04.550]  Why would Israel do that?
[01:47:05.731 --> 01:47:11.615]  And then at the same time, China threatening to invade Taiwan in 2005 or 2006.
[01:47:11.655 --> 01:47:13.236]  And I think we're going to see that.
[01:47:13.256 --> 01:47:18.879]  I think you're going to see America tied down in the Middle East on purpose, and they're going to let China take that.
[01:47:19.508 --> 01:47:23.171]  And then through the heightened fear with China, we're going to have to have that draft, Paul.
[01:47:23.691 --> 01:47:25.833]  And frankly, I hope that's the scenario they go with.
[01:47:25.873 --> 01:47:28.334]  It's better than nuking a city to get us all behind this.
[01:47:29.035 --> 01:47:30.616]  I think you'll see nuking the city, Alex.
[01:47:31.937 --> 01:47:33.758]  I'm going to cover that next hour.
[01:47:33.818 --> 01:47:34.699]  We'll get Paul's take on it.
[01:47:34.719 --> 01:47:36.280]  I want to keep him a little bit into the next hour with us.
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:38.301]  On American Hiroshima is possible.
[01:47:38.341 --> 01:47:43.965]  This is out of the Seattle Post-Intelligence, sir, but it was written out of the New York Times.
[01:47:44.926 --> 01:47:46.227]  Just out of control.
[01:47:46.247 --> 01:47:47.368]  Anything else, George?
[01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:52.792]  Well, there are two signs to a state in decline from an old Austrian political science book I read.
[01:47:52.932 --> 01:47:55.613]  One, ministers do not take responsibility for their actions.
[01:47:56.113 --> 01:47:58.414]  And two, you put your party before your country.
[01:47:58.874 --> 01:48:00.535]  Don't put your party before your country.
[01:48:00.755 --> 01:48:01.656]  Vote for your country.
[01:48:02.016 --> 01:48:03.276]  Vote for the other alternatives.
[01:48:03.876 --> 01:48:04.177]  All right.
[01:48:04.217 --> 01:48:04.957]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:05.917 --> 01:48:06.618]  Well said.
[01:48:06.718 --> 01:48:09.859]  Let's talk to Paul in Delaware.
[01:48:09.959 --> 01:48:10.739]  Paul, you're on the air.
[01:48:10.779 --> 01:48:11.199]  Go ahead.
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:11.860]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:13.760]  Hi, Paul.
[01:48:13.941 --> 01:48:15.542]  I really enjoy your work, man.
[01:48:15.582 --> 01:48:23.887]  I like your analysis today, and I really want to hear more of you, Paul Watson, on the show, and I appreciate the website, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:48:24.447 --> 01:48:27.990]  And also, I want to give a shout-out to Manuel, who's also doing a good job.
[01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:32.873]  Now, I want to comment to the communist that didn't come on your show.
[01:48:34.534 --> 01:48:39.377]  I have the same problem, and you do, with Sean Hannity, also, besides the communist.
[01:48:39.881 --> 01:48:47.343]  People don't want to debate you because they don't like your attitude or your spirit or, oh, you might get weird on them or something like that.
[01:48:47.383 --> 01:48:54.525]  So I would really like you, Alex, or someone like you that really knows your subjects, and you know every little juicy detail about everything.
[01:48:54.545 --> 01:48:56.745]  I don't know everything.
[01:48:56.765 --> 01:49:00.526]  Well, you don't know everything, but you do know a lot of different issues going on.
[01:49:01.446 --> 01:49:07.828]  I'm just surprised that you haven't covered, and it's old news, whether we went to the moon or not, and I really wish
[01:49:08.331 --> 01:49:13.938]  Before you get off the phone right now, don't talk about me because the call's not about me, it's about the issues.
[01:49:14.319 --> 01:49:25.153]  So I would like to tell, tell, ask you, what do you know about James M. Colyer and his work on the moon and his book Vote Scam, The Stealing of America?
[01:49:26.664 --> 01:49:30.168]  Well, we've got to end this segment, but I'll comment on it when we get back.
[01:49:30.188 --> 01:49:32.030]  I mean, I think Mr. Collier did great work.
[01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:33.933]  I know his information about the voting is dead on.
[01:49:33.953 --> 01:49:37.817]  I've interviewed his daughter and him before he died many, many times.
[01:49:38.077 --> 01:49:43.083]  So to show my ignorance, I didn't even know he'd done something on the moon.
[01:49:43.844 --> 01:49:46.748]  But we'll be right back, and I guess we can talk about the moon.
[01:49:52.153 --> 01:49:56.477]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:56.677 --> 01:50:01.101]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:05.624]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:05.664 --> 01:50:07.026]  The New World Order.
[01:50:07.826 --> 01:50:08.526]  Panama!
[01:50:08.806 --> 01:50:13.027]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:13.087 --> 01:50:20.009]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:20.129 --> 01:50:22.230]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:32.972]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:33.152 --> 01:50:35.913]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new

[01:51:04.694 --> 01:51:09.215]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:09.275 --> 01:51:20.618]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:21.218 --> 01:51:28.064]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:28.464 --> 01:51:30.606]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:51:31.087 --> 01:51:36.071]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[01:52:55.872 --> 01:53:01.894]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.514 --> 01:53:05.475]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.135 --> 01:53:22.499]  The federal government, run by complete criminals, has been caught planting hundreds of false news stories, putting out fake terror alerts, is now leaking the threat of nuclear terrorism and saying Al-Qaeda has a 10 megaton
[01:53:24.415 --> 01:53:38.298]  nuclear device or atom bomb, primitive bomb, and that they're sure to detonate it in America, and the whole thing is codenamed Dragonfire, and that they're planning to use it.
[01:53:38.759 --> 01:53:44.360]  And that's why Dick Cheney spent off and on the last two years inside our bunker.
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:49.321]  Anytime Bush is at the White House, Cheney is inside our bunker.
[01:53:49.341 --> 01:53:52.482]  Of course, it turned out he's not really inside our
[01:53:53.453 --> 01:54:00.276]  He's had so many heart problems he's been spending most of the time at hunting lodges in Wyoming and Utah and Montana.
[01:54:00.656 --> 01:54:02.317]  So it's just a bunch of propaganda.
[01:54:03.117 --> 01:54:06.019]  But we know Cheney will be in the bunker when there's a big attack.
[01:54:06.079 --> 01:54:06.819]  We know that.
[01:54:06.919 --> 01:54:08.080]  Coordinating things.
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:12.922]  We're going to end the shower here in a minute and go
[01:54:14.105 --> 01:54:16.746]  Back to your calls and then into this story and a bunch of other news.
[01:54:17.526 --> 01:54:25.548]  Paul, I want to plug your book and my book here in just a second, but first off, what's some of the other news you want to cover, not just this Dragonfire situation in the next hour?
[01:54:26.908 --> 01:54:40.311]  I think we need to cover the further comments of Porter Goss about the domestic involvement of the CIA, especially in light, now we know, of this bill he was behind back in June, which basically
[01:54:41.150 --> 01:54:44.457]  Open the doorway for that exact process to take place.
[01:54:44.477 --> 01:54:48.985]  A domestic CIA quote in his bill arresting Americans.
[01:54:49.266 --> 01:54:51.330]  You have the AP article posted on both sides.
[01:54:52.293 --> 01:54:58.776]  Yes, I mean, why did he say big brother or dead brother when he's supposed to be the director of the CIA, which operates abroad?
[01:54:59.017 --> 01:55:09.802]  Okay, and then briefly, and we'll get into details on that in the third hour, but the Moon situation, I mean, this caller every week begs me to talk about this, and I'm going to get some gusts on about it.
[01:55:09.902 --> 01:55:12.644]  I just really, overall, see it as a distraction.
[01:55:12.684 --> 01:55:13.804]  You can't prove it any other way.
[01:55:13.824 --> 01:55:15.145]  If you disagree with me, though, tell me.
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:21.722]  Well, I would say that the official record that we were shown is a hoax.
[01:55:22.322 --> 01:55:31.284]  I think we've been to the moon because technology is 50 years advanced of what we know, but I've got a 6-hour video which is a scientific presentation of the evidence.
[01:55:31.364 --> 01:55:37.926]  I mean, strings pulling the astronauts up off the ground when they fall over, you know, the astronauts opening their visors up and laughing.
[01:55:38.766 --> 01:55:58.658]  There were reports which were in newspaper articles in Australia where people saw, during the live feed, coke bottles roll across the moon's surface, the inability to get past the Van Allen radiation belt in what amounted to a tin can, using the same background landscapes when they were supposed to be on entirely different parts of the moon.
[01:55:58.718 --> 01:55:59.418]  No, I've seen it.
[01:55:59.478 --> 01:56:01.760]  It's stunning evidence and we'll cover that then.
[01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:05.642]  Okay, we'll be right back folks with the third hour.
[01:56:06.701 --> 01:56:13.465]  Before we end this hour, Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[01:56:14.106 --> 01:56:18.108]  It's an amazing book, over 320 pages, $19.95.
[01:56:18.268 --> 01:56:21.110]  Get a second copy for $11.95 to give as a gift.
[01:56:21.751 --> 01:56:23.372]  That supports Paul and what he's doing.
[01:56:24.292 --> 01:56:30.516]  Also, you can read his book online at PrisonPlanet.tv when you're a subscriber, as well as my book.

[01:56:36.428 --> 01:56:42.349]  My book's $11.95, 220-something pages, covering 9-11 and government-sponsored terror.
[01:56:43.290 --> 01:56:47.791]  And I've got two films on 9-11 that I made and two other videos on 9-11 that I carry.
[01:56:47.851 --> 01:56:52.052]  One of the newest is George Humphrey's 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.

[01:57:13.846 --> 01:57:14.667]  Make copies of them.
[01:57:14.707 --> 01:57:15.608]  Get them out to people.
[01:57:15.628 --> 01:57:17.469]  It is having such a massive effect, so don't stop.
[01:57:28.706 --> 01:57:32.529]  We've got to expose the terrorists and be very public and vocal about this.
[01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:39.494]  Alright, we'll start the third hour, get some more of these calls out of the way, then we'll get into nuclear blackmail by LCIADA, and much more.
[01:57:39.575 --> 01:57:40.015]  Stay with us.
[01:57:43.618 --> 01:57:43.958]  Hello!
[01:57:49.803 --> 01:57:50.443]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.124 --> 01:57:52.204]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.885 --> 01:57:53.966]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.617 --> 01:57:55.439]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:57.101]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.762 --> 01:58:01.589]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.969 --> 01:58:06.076]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.618 --> 01:58:08.400]  It's off day!
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:13.904]  16th day of August, 2004, already into hour number 3.
[01:58:14.544 --> 01:58:15.905]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:15.925 --> 01:58:19.368]  The total free number to get involved on air is 800-259-9231.
[01:58:20.669 --> 01:58:27.856]  We're talking to Paul Watson, who joins us at least once a week, the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:27.916 --> 01:58:34.061]  We're going to get into nuclear blackmail by El Siaida, and the Global is trying to scare us into preparing for that.
[01:58:34.890 --> 01:58:39.712]  Yes, I just wanted to add a couple of auxiliary comments to what you were discussing regarding that turkey, Chuck Hagel.
[01:58:39.772 --> 01:58:42.394]  Last month, when you had Bev Harris on your program, the Baltimore Sun
[01:59:05.214 --> 01:59:23.642]  Uh, reported that the same machines that Tricky Chuck Hagel used to manipulate the elections in Nebraska are the same machines, the same exact machines that were sold to Julio Chavez, and they have the ability to be remotely manipulated.
[01:59:24.142 --> 01:59:32.906]  And, uh, it wouldn't surprise me if, uh, Julio Chavez used the same tricks that Chuck used, you know, to get himself elected there.
[01:59:33.570 --> 01:59:38.033]  Now, I just want to move on to something that I read in the Kansas City Star.
[01:59:38.053 --> 01:59:39.254]  Let me just stop you for a minute.
[01:59:39.334 --> 01:59:43.396]  What is wrong with someone owning the voting machines that everyone votes for them on?
[01:59:43.656 --> 01:59:46.078]  Well, according to Bill... I mean, that sounds like freedom to me.
[01:59:46.118 --> 01:59:51.321]  When the candidate owns the company, runs, is way behind the polls, but magically wins.
[01:59:52.662 --> 01:59:53.963]  That sounds like freedom to me, sir.
[01:59:54.343 --> 01:59:55.944]  He's also a Bilderberg Group member.
[01:59:56.004 --> 01:59:57.145]  He's a very good person.
[01:59:57.485 --> 02:00:00.807]  Well, and let me add one other thing that Bill Harris also mentioned.
[02:00:01.107 --> 02:00:08.051]  He failed to disclose the fact that he had a serious conflict of interest in owning these machines prior to the elections.
[02:00:08.071 --> 02:00:10.733]  Well, that's freedom, sir, but he might be without a cut.
[02:00:11.754 --> 02:00:13.395]  How dare you ask questions about the election.
[02:00:13.435 --> 02:00:14.175]  You shouldn't do that.
[02:00:14.215 --> 02:00:14.635]  That's evil.
[02:00:14.896 --> 02:00:17.337]  You think this is America or something?
[02:00:17.998 --> 02:00:19.438]  But this is the New World Order.
[02:00:20.039 --> 02:00:21.820]  But your next comment about Kansas City?
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:35.868]  Yeah, the Kansas City Star reported, and this is in harmony with something that you said earlier about Calhoun out of California making some statements about anti-protest marches should be, what, arrested or something like that?
[02:00:35.908 --> 02:00:37.770]  Yeah, the Democrats love the neocons, yeah.
[02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:48.296]  Yeah, if you go to the Nation and World section of the Star News today, it was, and I think you may have had this lady on your program, Denise Lieberman from the ACLU,
[02:00:50.747 --> 02:01:01.150]  Sid mentioned that there were three protesters pursued for three days basically dogged because they had planned on attending the protest up in Boston.
[02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:01.690]  Yes.
[02:01:02.811 --> 02:01:13.275]  Dogged for three days by the FBI on the, well they claimed that they were possible terrorists according to the story.
[02:01:15.086 --> 02:01:21.531]  To prevent these young men from attending that protest, they issued subpoenas to them.
[02:01:21.571 --> 02:01:26.154]  So on the day they were to attend the protest, they couldn't because they had these subpoenas.
[02:01:26.254 --> 02:01:28.836]  And again, that just sets the precedent to do this to everybody.
[02:01:28.876 --> 02:01:30.317]  The real anarchists work for the feds.
[02:01:30.357 --> 02:01:30.977]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:31.318 --> 02:01:31.998]  Comments, Paul?
[02:01:32.939 --> 02:01:42.966]  Well, picking up back on the Chavez vote fraud point, we got the article on PrisonPlanet.com, Venezuela's Chavez claims victory, foes cry fraud.
[02:01:44.198 --> 02:01:52.206]  It's not unimaginable that he would do that, but at the same time we know that the CIA has planned on several occasions coups to remove Chavez.
[02:01:52.286 --> 02:01:53.607]  They've done kidnapping before.
[02:01:53.987 --> 02:01:58.712]  Yeah, they've been caught funding the opposition, the protesters against him.
[02:01:59.093 --> 02:02:06.180]  So we know Chavez is independent of the New World Order in terms of he doesn't want Venezuela to be a part of it, but that doesn't
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:10.262]  Preclude that he could carry out fraud within his own country.
[02:02:10.322 --> 02:02:14.104]  So you can kind of look at that from two perspectives, but it is possible.
[02:02:15.745 --> 02:02:16.526]  Very possible.
[02:02:16.586 --> 02:02:21.468]  Good points, Rodney, Chris, Steve, Paul, Keith and others.
[02:02:21.848 --> 02:02:26.691]  We're going to go to your calls quickly, then into nuclear blackmail and much, much more.

[02:02:30.558 --> 02:02:32.403]  And denying the facts doesn't keep you safe.
[02:02:32.423 --> 02:02:35.069]  Sticking your head in the sand only makes you more vulnerable.
[02:02:35.130 --> 02:02:36.733]  We've got to be vocal, informed.
[02:02:37.765 --> 02:02:39.866]  Out front and exposing the globalists.
[02:02:39.886 --> 02:02:40.906]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:02:40.926 --> 02:02:43.747]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:02:44.308 --> 02:02:45.828]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:46.008 --> 02:02:49.089]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:49.229 --> 02:02:53.131]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:53.171 --> 02:02:57.413]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:57.753 --> 02:03:01.534]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:01.674 --> 02:03:03.475]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.075 --> 02:03:06.978]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:03:07.018 --> 02:03:11.723]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:11.883 --> 02:03:14.926]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:15.106 --> 02:03:17.968]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:18.469 --> 02:03:24.595]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:25.115 --> 02:03:28.900]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:04:43.971 --> 02:04:48.333]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[02:04:48.473 --> 02:04:55.535]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.

[02:05:24.748 --> 02:05:26.670]  The fractional reserve system, etc.
[02:05:26.890 --> 02:05:29.533]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourself.

[02:05:51.165 --> 02:05:52.225]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.926 --> 02:05:54.026]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.686 --> 02:05:55.526]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.267 --> 02:05:57.127]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.827 --> 02:06:01.769]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.009 --> 02:06:06.170]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.932 --> 02:06:11.152]  Alright, my friends.
[02:06:12.072 --> 02:06:13.533]  We're back live.
[02:06:16.056 --> 02:06:19.938]  Continuing with the news and information, let's go back to the calls.
[02:06:20.879 --> 02:06:21.919]  Let's talk to Chris.
[02:06:21.999 --> 02:06:23.880]  Chris, where are you calling us from today?
[02:06:24.801 --> 02:06:25.401]  California.
[02:06:25.701 --> 02:06:26.061]  Welcome.
[02:06:26.081 --> 02:06:27.522]  How are you doing today?
[02:06:27.702 --> 02:06:27.922]  Good.
[02:06:28.803 --> 02:06:33.786]  Hey, I wanted to touch on a story I saw in the Los Angeles Times on August 7th.
[02:06:34.406 --> 02:06:40.949]  It says, uh, unmanned aircraft gaining the Pentagon's confidence.
[02:06:41.170 --> 02:06:43.791]  It's all about this aircraft called the Global Hawk.
[02:06:45.450 --> 02:07:01.168]  And what I found interesting... Well, Global Hawk is a control system for unmanned aircraft and they say by 2010, 80% of the fighters are going to be unmanned and within 20 years there's going to be almost nothing except troop carriers that have people on board.
[02:07:02.094 --> 02:07:09.221]  And again, you're going to have just a few globalists that can literally, and I'm not talking about the movie I, Robot, folks, or Isaac Asimov.
[02:07:09.661 --> 02:07:14.786]  I mean, in reality, droid armies, this is what everything is shifting to.
[02:07:15.266 --> 02:07:20.190]  And again, they're not artificially intelligent robots or aircraft.
[02:07:20.531 --> 02:07:24.955]  They are remote control pre-programmed, and a program can be
[02:07:25.615 --> 02:07:34.759]  put into them to attack hundreds or even thousands of targets, then they launch these droid armies, and then it just takes a few globalists to literally wreak havoc.
[02:07:35.059 --> 02:07:48.705]  And as things get more and more robotic and controlled, this is going to give the globalists just total mastery to where even if their own minions don't follow orders, they're going to be able to shut off water supplies.
[02:07:49.205 --> 02:07:55.029]  Shut down cities, bring in... They've got these little mini armored tanks that are remote controlled.
[02:07:55.509 --> 02:07:59.332]  All of this stuff to be unleashed upon us is like something out of T2 or something.
[02:07:59.932 --> 02:08:00.573]  But go ahead sir.
[02:08:00.853 --> 02:08:08.398]  I'll tell you what I found chilling is there's actually a picture of a lieutenant colonel.
[02:08:08.418 --> 02:08:10.239]  He's one of the people that controls it.
[02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:14.322]  And the patch he has on his arm
[02:08:15.789 --> 02:08:24.073]  Is a circle with a triangle inside of it, and then inside of the triangle is a skull with crossed bones.
[02:08:26.114 --> 02:08:28.715]  It was just kind of chilling to me when I saw that.
[02:08:29.455 --> 02:08:31.276]  Well, don't you know the good guys wear skulls?
[02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:32.196]  I mean, that's part of freedom.
[02:08:33.517 --> 02:08:37.439]  Why don't you email me that LA Times story and we'll get it posted.
[02:08:37.759 --> 02:08:38.499]  Okay, I'd love to.
[02:08:38.519 --> 02:08:40.400]  Can I ask you one other quick question?
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:41.761]  Can I ask you a question first, though?
[02:08:41.921 --> 02:08:42.501]  Yes, sir.
[02:08:42.561 --> 02:08:44.982]  Paul, what's the best email address for him to send that story?
[02:08:47.031 --> 02:08:50.572]  Well, just go to PrisonPlanet.com and click on Email Webmaster.
[02:08:50.592 --> 02:08:52.132]  That's the best address to send it to.
[02:08:52.532 --> 02:08:52.893]  Okay.
[02:08:53.373 --> 02:08:53.893]  Go ahead now.
[02:08:53.913 --> 02:08:54.873]  Stop interrupting, Chris.
[02:08:56.673 --> 02:09:04.875]  I was wondering just how many members of Bush's cabinet are Skull and Bones members?
[02:09:04.915 --> 02:09:13.577]  The new head of the Federal Commission that oversees the finances, he's Skull and Bones.
[02:09:15.012 --> 02:09:19.194]  The first party he had at the White House was the Skull and Bones reunion.
[02:09:19.554 --> 02:09:28.179]  I believe four members of his man cabinet are Skull and Bones and I believe total eight people in the administration are, but I don't have those numbers in front of me.
[02:09:28.419 --> 02:09:29.619]  Paul, do you have that in front of you?
[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:38.003]  No, the quote I remember reading was that he appointed ten key individuals to key members of the military and the government.
[02:09:38.023 --> 02:09:41.865]  So it's somewhere between eight and ten that were Skull and Bones.
[02:09:43.775 --> 02:09:45.296]  So there's your answer.
[02:09:46.136 --> 02:09:46.496]  Okay.
[02:09:47.276 --> 02:09:54.919]  On another note, I'm an artist and I've started making pictures and I think sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words.
[02:09:55.980 --> 02:10:10.185]  And if people would just type in Tokapelli, you know, into Google or something, Google T-O-K-A-P-E-L-L-I, then they can get to my site and see a lot of stuff I've been doing that's
[02:10:11.892 --> 02:10:15.133]  Trying to wake people up, you know, because this stuff is really happening.
[02:10:15.494 --> 02:10:17.634]  I'm Terry.
[02:10:18.675 --> 02:10:19.135]  I hear you.
[02:10:19.515 --> 02:10:20.636]  Keep it up and take care.
[02:10:21.156 --> 02:10:23.617]  Steve, Steve in Oregon, you're on the air.
[02:10:23.677 --> 02:10:24.017]  Welcome.
[02:10:24.057 --> 02:10:25.078]  Or Georgia, excuse me.
[02:10:25.578 --> 02:10:26.318]  Yeah, Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:10:26.338 --> 02:10:27.119]  Hey, Alex.
[02:10:27.379 --> 02:10:27.699]  Hello.
[02:10:28.059 --> 02:10:37.243]  What the Gulf War story you have posted today, do you think that depleted uranium, I don't see a lot of confirmation on that.
[02:10:38.414 --> 02:10:39.495]  Do you think that's for real?
[02:10:39.775 --> 02:10:41.937]  Number one, I think your phone's having a little bit of a problem.
[02:10:41.957 --> 02:10:43.278]  Can you speak up for me, please?
[02:10:44.299 --> 02:10:48.962]  Yeah, did you think that the depleted uranium is for real?
[02:10:49.583 --> 02:10:50.984]  All the effects that it has?
[02:10:51.084 --> 02:10:52.445]  Do I think it's for real?
[02:10:52.885 --> 02:10:53.105]  Yeah.
[02:10:53.226 --> 02:10:54.927]  You say you haven't seen a lot of evidence?
[02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:56.568]  No, not really.
[02:10:56.608 --> 02:10:58.169]  I've seen only just a couple of stories.
[02:10:58.630 --> 02:10:58.910]  Okay.
[02:10:59.931 --> 02:11:04.294]  Paul, do we have a depleted uranium section somewhere on Prism Plant?
[02:11:05.214 --> 02:11:11.978]  I don't believe so at the moment, but we can certainly... Yeah, I keep saying I want a fluoride vaccine, depleted uranium, you know, toxic section.
[02:11:11.998 --> 02:11:15.500]  I know we have the vaccine fluoride area, but I want to... I know you're working hard.
[02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:16.501]  I want to expand that.
[02:11:17.522 --> 02:11:21.084]  Sir, we have interviewed Dr. Rocky twice.
[02:11:21.124 --> 02:11:22.985]  He's been interviewed a bunch on this network.
[02:11:23.345 --> 02:11:26.627]  He literally wrote the book in the 80s and 90s on DU.
[02:11:29.603 --> 02:11:41.083]  It was recommended that it only be used in key situations in open country against specific heavy line battle tanks in an emergency war against the Soviets.
[02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:53.338]  That is the only time you use it in the A-10 war hogs and in the Abrams tanks in tank battles when Eastern Europe is being overrunning into Western Europe.
[02:11:53.418 --> 02:12:07.428]  It is an emergency nuclear war type weapon and so they used it in the 1991 Gulf War, which they weren't supposed to, then they used it yet again in Serbia,
[02:12:08.609 --> 02:12:12.953]  And now they have used it in desert dust too.
[02:12:13.013 --> 02:12:14.694]  Now listen to me, this is the facts.
[02:12:16.095 --> 02:12:22.680]  The heavy metal nature of it alone, it is a super toxic metal, more toxic than mercury or lead.
[02:12:24.216 --> 02:12:49.475]  It aerosolizes on contact, and now it's not just in the Abrams sabot rounds, it's not just in the Warthogs, it's now in the heavy and medium machine guns on Bradleys, it's in the Bradley cannon rounds, it's even being deployed to some of our troops and for anti-personnel operations to shoot through enemy's armor, and when it hits a target it aerosolizes, sir.
[02:12:50.407 --> 02:12:51.787]  When it hits a hard target.
[02:12:52.567 --> 02:12:55.688]  And Dr. Rocky was hired to go over there and clean it up.
[02:12:55.768 --> 02:12:57.909]  And his unit, most of his unit has died.
[02:12:57.969 --> 02:13:02.870]  He's had cancer multiple times in his sinuses and into his lungs.
[02:13:02.930 --> 02:13:04.610]  He's barely hanging on right now.
[02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:06.090]  He wrote the book on it.
[02:13:06.110 --> 02:13:08.931]  It's an 8 hour training video and a 200 page pamphlet.
[02:13:09.211 --> 02:13:11.751]  He literally wrote the book, studied it at Los Alamos.
[02:13:12.531 --> 02:13:15.672]  And it's deadly from the heavy metal side as well.
[02:13:16.172 --> 02:13:19.933]  Then they tried to deny all this and the New York Daily News
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:25.705]  What, six months ago, did blood test of the troops.
[02:13:25.825 --> 02:13:28.248]  Everyone that they tested wasn't a hypochondriac.
[02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:35.737]  They all had up to two rims of uranium in them, which is highly radioactive, and the heavy metal, and were dead and dying.
[02:13:36.438 --> 02:13:37.439]  So, yes sir.
[02:13:38.214 --> 02:13:41.818]  Depleted uranium is serious, serious business.
[02:13:42.599 --> 02:13:45.743]  Iraqi children are three times more likely to be born deformed.
[02:13:47.185 --> 02:13:51.690]  The government's own numbers, Gulf War troops are three times more likely to have deformed children.
[02:13:52.771 --> 02:13:54.754]  So, Paul comments to what he just said.
[02:13:55.669 --> 02:14:01.033]  Yeah, the caller's referring to an article on PrisonPlanet.com out of Life Magazine.
[02:14:01.073 --> 02:14:02.995]  It's an eight-page article.
[02:14:03.035 --> 02:14:05.016]  The tiny victims of Desert Storm.
[02:14:05.056 --> 02:14:12.422]  When our soldiers risked their lives in the Gulf, they never imagined that their children might suffer the consequences or that their country would turn its back on them.
[02:14:12.923 --> 02:14:16.125]  And it's a case of a young boy who doesn't have arms.
[02:14:16.145 --> 02:14:18.407]  He's got hands coming out, you know, of his shoulders.
[02:14:18.999 --> 02:14:27.043]  mirroring the horrible pictures of the Iraqi children which, you know, points out the fact that our soldiers' children are also suffering from the same horrible effects.
[02:14:27.223 --> 02:14:29.764]  Oh, it just so happens Serbia's deformities have trebled.
[02:14:30.624 --> 02:14:38.548]  Yeah, I mean, there was an article a few months ago in Iraq where they didn't clean it up, they simply, you know, covered it over with soil.
[02:14:38.768 --> 02:14:40.189]  Now, let me explain this.
[02:14:40.429 --> 02:14:43.230]  In the first Gulf War, we conservatively used
[02:14:45.732 --> 02:14:47.674]  What was this thing like 3,000 times?
[02:14:47.734 --> 02:14:50.176]  This time it's 10 times more.
[02:14:50.556 --> 02:14:56.481]  And in the first Gulf War, though they shouldn't have even used it, they did use it where there's, you know, in the theater they're supposed to.
[02:14:56.841 --> 02:14:57.502]  A tank battle.
[02:14:58.067 --> 02:14:59.308]  And it was out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:14:59.648 --> 02:15:04.312]  And so just our troops hauling away the wreckage and civilian contractors got sick.
[02:15:05.093 --> 02:15:07.615]  And some areas of Kuwait City, people have become ill.
[02:15:07.875 --> 02:15:09.436]  But it was used in limited areas.
[02:15:09.476 --> 02:15:16.882]  This time, our government bombarded all the major cities, all the major police bunkers and government facilities, power plants, you name it.
[02:15:17.731 --> 02:15:19.612]  And guess where our troops moved in?
[02:15:19.632 --> 02:15:20.692]  This is in the newspaper.
[02:15:21.252 --> 02:15:29.954]  After we took over, they moved the troops in to the airport and the barracks and the palace, and it said they just came in with trucks and dumped some dirt on top of it.
[02:15:31.875 --> 02:15:34.536]  So if it's so good for you, why'd they even do that?
[02:15:34.576 --> 02:15:37.076]  The point is, you're not even supposed to use this in built-up areas.
[02:15:37.416 --> 02:15:39.077]  You're not supposed to use this on buildings.
[02:15:40.183 --> 02:15:53.812]  And the journalists that were in Iraq to investigate it, such as the Japanese journalists, were of course subject to kidnappings and they were threatened to be beheaded and then they were deported back home without ever having the opportunity to conclude their investigation.
[02:15:53.852 --> 02:15:56.754]  And now they don't even have LCIA to kidnap people for the CIA.
[02:15:56.834 --> 02:16:04.939]  Our government just openly says in the London Telegraph and Associated Press, leave the hotel, we're about to bombard your town or we're going to kill you journalists.
[02:16:05.119 --> 02:16:08.361]  And they open fire with machine guns on the hotel and say leave.
[02:16:10.445 --> 02:16:12.326]  So now they're not even covering it up, Paul.
[02:16:12.346 --> 02:16:16.668]  No, well, they've shut down most of the media.
[02:16:16.708 --> 02:16:19.569]  They feel that, you know, not much of it will leak out anymore.
[02:16:19.649 --> 02:16:20.689]  I mean, picture this.
[02:16:20.749 --> 02:16:24.071]  Western journalists, British journalists, American journalists in a hotel.
[02:16:25.131 --> 02:16:28.873]  Again, police tell journalists, leave Najaf or be shot.
[02:16:29.233 --> 02:16:34.915]  And they just walk up with our troops backing up the Iraqi Security Force and on a bullhorn said, get out of the building.
[02:16:35.575 --> 02:16:36.976]  You have six hours.
[02:16:37.016 --> 02:16:39.257]  And they just open fire with machine guns into the windows.
[02:16:40.699 --> 02:16:49.783]  Well, it's just like in Russia where anyone who criticizes Putin has gunned down any journalist who's gunned down on the side of the street and no questions are asked.
[02:16:49.843 --> 02:16:51.764]  But Putin says the war's good and is our new buddy.
[02:16:52.344 --> 02:16:55.485]  Oh, but he accidentally lost some nukes that Al-Qaeda's got now.
[02:16:57.686 --> 02:17:00.127]  Does that answer your question, Steve?
[02:17:00.768 --> 02:17:06.350]  Well, I was wondering whether there's not more state-spied media coverage on the effects of the troops.
[02:17:07.046 --> 02:17:09.848]  Well, I mean, it's been, it's there.
[02:17:10.089 --> 02:17:12.831]  We ought to have a transcript made of that Rocky interview.
[02:17:12.911 --> 02:17:14.932]  Paul, is that Rocky interview a free play?
[02:17:14.952 --> 02:17:16.253]  Can people find that on the site?
[02:17:16.914 --> 02:17:19.476]  I believe it is free play, yeah, if you go back in the archive.
[02:17:19.956 --> 02:17:20.116]  Yeah.
[02:17:20.737 --> 02:17:20.937]  Alright.
[02:17:22.198 --> 02:17:22.678]  Thank you.
[02:17:22.698 --> 02:17:24.180]  Oh, yeah.
[02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:27.462]  We're just going to take three more calls, because I've got news I want to cover with Paul.
[02:17:28.043 --> 02:17:34.468]  We'll talk to Paul, we'll talk to Keith, we'll talk to Dan, when we get back, and then I'm going to get into the nuclear blackmail and all the other news.
[02:17:34.488 --> 02:17:35.408]  Stay with us, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:45.859 --> 02:17:46.899]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:50.020]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:54.442]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:17:54.862 --> 02:17:55.682]  So what do you do?
[02:17:56.002 --> 02:18:00.603]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:18:01.083 --> 02:18:03.164]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:18:03.684 --> 02:18:04.585]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:18:04.985 --> 02:18:08.687]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[02:18:09.007 --> 02:18:18.392]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:18:18.432 --> 02:18:18.812]  government.
[02:18:19.052 --> 02:18:25.555]  Gives you easy-to-follow video instructions and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:18:25.856 --> 02:18:28.977]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:18:30.678 --> 02:18:32.702]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:32.822 --> 02:18:33.303]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.524 --> 02:18:35.106]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:18:44.295 --> 02:18:45.295]  It's finally here!
[02:18:45.415 --> 02:18:46.375]  Spring has arrived!
[02:18:46.596 --> 02:18:49.556]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:18:49.776 --> 02:18:53.237]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:18:53.437 --> 02:19:01.599]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:19:01.859 --> 02:19:05.580]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:10.821]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:19:11.101 --> 02:19:15.603]  Ark's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:19:15.803 --> 02:19:19.865]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:19:19.945 --> 02:19:27.148]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:19:27.388 --> 02:19:28.569]  Save money, eat healthy.
[02:19:28.609 --> 02:19:29.089]  We're good.
[02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:48.483]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:19:48.723 --> 02:19:52.165]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:19:52.366 --> 02:19:54.847]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:19:55.087 --> 02:20:03.673]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:20:04.053 --> 02:20:09.817]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:20:10.077 --> 02:20:12.058]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[02:20:12.278 --> 02:20:19.200]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.

[02:20:33.846 --> 02:20:38.314]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[02:20:38.415 --> 02:20:38.655]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:38.675 --> 02:20:40.659]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[02:20:44.139 --> 02:20:47.382]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[02:20:47.722 --> 02:20:52.405]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[02:20:52.585 --> 02:20:54.107]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[02:20:54.307 --> 02:20:56.729]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:20:56.949 --> 02:21:03.694]  Pet Accident Wash-Up Solution, or PAWS, is the quickest and safest pet stain and odor eliminator known to man, or man's best friend.
[02:21:03.974 --> 02:21:07.195]  PAWS is safe on any material, even directly on your pet's bedding.
[02:21:07.436 --> 02:21:09.857]  PAWS will work on the toughest stains and odors in your home.

[02:21:13.078 --> 02:21:15.279]  Proving again, it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:21:15.639 --> 02:21:18.940]  It's only a matter of time until Fido, or Fluffy, has an accident.
[02:21:19.180 --> 02:21:20.321]  Be prepared with PAWS.
[02:21:20.641 --> 02:21:24.623]  Use PAWS anywhere stains and odors are a problem, like the laundry or the bathroom.
[02:21:24.843 --> 02:21:28.344]  Try PAWS once and you'll quickly discover it's just better to use PAWS.

[02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:42.451]  Use nothing to lose but stains and odors!
[02:21:56.445 --> 02:21:59.048]  Continuing with your phone calls, because I love them.
[02:21:59.068 --> 02:22:00.610]  They always take us in different directions.
[02:22:01.932 --> 02:22:04.355]  But before we do that, we're just going to take three more.
[02:22:04.455 --> 02:22:07.078]  Paul and Don and John.
[02:22:07.719 --> 02:22:09.621]  Sorry to others, but we've got to get to some other news here.
[02:22:11.067 --> 02:22:16.133]  You know, the last caller, Steve in Atlanta, Georgia, had a good point, Paul.
[02:22:16.674 --> 02:22:24.243]  How can our troops be breathing GU, which the Army's own manuals and training materials say is deadly?
[02:22:24.784 --> 02:22:27.287]  How can they be living in barracks that were bombarded with it?
[02:22:27.587 --> 02:22:30.611]  How can they be coming down ill and it's in the back of the newspaper?
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:37.727]  And then the people who speak out against it get shouted at and going, you comey, shut up!
[02:22:37.867 --> 02:22:42.131]  I mean, it's just, if you support the troops, you should be against this being used.
[02:22:42.592 --> 02:22:46.256]  This was developed as an experimental weapon.
[02:22:48.029 --> 02:23:02.091]  During the 70s and 80s in the Cold War for emergencies and stockpiled in Europe in case the Soviets launched a heavy armored attack in front of nuclear strikes to capture Berlin and Paris and other areas.
[02:23:02.672 --> 02:23:08.557]  It was not meant to be used all over the globe in these police actions, these takeovers.
[02:23:08.858 --> 02:23:12.701]  But they're doing it, and our troops are dead and dying from it, and that's not debatable.
[02:23:13.101 --> 02:23:14.923]  So yes, it is incredible.
[02:23:14.963 --> 02:23:16.284]  How in the world do they do this?
[02:23:16.304 --> 02:23:20.728]  Well, how do they damage millions of children with mercury-containing vaccines?
[02:23:20.788 --> 02:23:27.114]  When they get caught doing it, they increase the level of it, according to Congress's investigator, Dr. Geyer.
[02:23:27.294 --> 02:23:27.434]  Paul?
[02:23:28.706 --> 02:23:37.069]  Well yeah, in Britain they've said we're removing the triple jab vaccine, which may have contained mercury due to, you know, opposition pressure.
[02:23:37.329 --> 02:23:39.090]  But what are they going to replace it with?
[02:23:39.350 --> 02:23:43.032]  Five jabs for babies who are, you know, barely weeks old.
[02:23:43.292 --> 02:23:45.893]  So it's just taking a level of tyranny even deeper.
[02:23:46.273 --> 02:23:53.756]  But with the troop situation, people can't make the differentiation between supporting the government and supporting the troops.
[02:23:54.296 --> 02:23:59.941]  If you don't support the government, then you're against the troops, because people can't hold more than one thought in their head at the same time.
[02:24:00.982 --> 02:24:11.570]  Which is why people are blind to the fact, you know, the photographs of Donald Rumsfeld handing over the biologicals to Saddam in 83 and 84, which later rained down on our troops.
[02:24:12.871 --> 02:24:15.654]  After our government blew up the bunkers to cover up the evidence.
[02:24:15.994 --> 02:24:16.214]  Yep.
[02:24:16.935 --> 02:24:18.216]  We got the video, U.S.
[02:24:18.296 --> 02:24:19.717]  marked chemical bioweapons.
[02:24:20.868 --> 02:24:24.592]  And because we're against selling Saddam chemical bio-weapons, we're anti-patriotic.
[02:24:24.612 --> 02:24:27.515]  I mean, how does that make sense, folks?
[02:24:27.595 --> 02:24:37.025]  I mean, if our government declared war on volcanoes and said, let's dump thousands of troops down the mouths of volcanoes, we would be for the troops being against that policy.
[02:24:39.227 --> 02:24:40.328]  Well, many of the troops are.
[02:24:40.348 --> 02:24:43.511]  I mean, we have stories about them throwing over the side of
[02:24:44.494 --> 02:25:02.679]  Both, you know, anthrax vaccines and things like this, where the enforcers can try and give them these commands, but if they see that they're literally, you know, out-of-bounds insane orders, then just like this Oregon unit that tried to stop the torture and were then ordered off, in many cases they will not follow the orders.
[02:25:04.899 --> 02:25:05.680]  And good for them!
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:06.740]  Good for them!
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:08.980]  And I've heard neocons now calling them traitors!
[02:25:09.581 --> 02:25:11.001]  How dare them not torture small children!
[02:25:12.202 --> 02:25:12.742]  Well, who was it?
[02:25:12.762 --> 02:25:19.824]  Was it Britt Hume that said that the families of the troops who spoke out against the war, they were traitors as well, and the troops were traitors.
[02:25:19.864 --> 02:25:20.605]  So, I mean, yeah.
[02:25:22.765 --> 02:25:25.086]  But then that fat belly, he doesn't go off and fight.
[02:25:26.647 --> 02:25:27.667]  None of them do.
[02:25:28.087 --> 02:25:29.207]  Yeah, none of them do.
[02:25:29.227 --> 02:25:30.688]  Let's talk to Paul in Maryland.
[02:25:30.728 --> 02:25:31.468]  Paul, go ahead.
[02:25:32.048 --> 02:25:32.909]  Yes, hello, Alex.
[02:25:33.189 --> 02:25:33.469]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:33.969 --> 02:25:35.729]  I listen as much as I can.
[02:25:36.210 --> 02:25:38.850]  KDI, WKDI over in Denton, Maryland.
[02:25:39.551 --> 02:25:39.791]  Great.
[02:25:41.761 --> 02:25:46.663]  Unfortunately, you're not on a station over near to Baltimore, Washington.
[02:25:46.703 --> 02:25:47.784]  That station's hard to get.
[02:25:47.844 --> 02:25:51.626]  I have a DC radio that pulls it in real good.
[02:25:51.686 --> 02:25:52.966]  We're honored to have that.
[02:25:52.986 --> 02:25:56.348]  I think they've been carrying our broadcast for two-plus years.
[02:25:56.448 --> 02:25:59.570]  It's a great station and covers millions and millions of people.
[02:25:59.590 --> 02:26:01.370]  We want to thank them and all other affiliates.
[02:26:02.011 --> 02:26:02.871]  Right.
[02:26:04.052 --> 02:26:06.153]  One of the major reasons I was calling was
[02:26:07.052 --> 02:26:10.793]  I support Michael Peruca, the Constitution candidate.
[02:26:10.933 --> 02:26:12.553]  I keep meaning to get him on, you know.
[02:26:13.213 --> 02:26:15.254]  And his website, can I mention his website?
[02:26:15.274 --> 02:26:15.794]  Sure you can.
[02:26:16.114 --> 02:26:21.395]  It's peruca2004.com, that's P-E-R-O-U-T-K-A.
[02:26:22.335 --> 02:26:29.737]  And he puts out a weekly email, or more often than that, as the situation warrants.
[02:26:30.413 --> 02:26:33.335]  I was wondering if you would like me to forward that email to you.
[02:26:33.796 --> 02:26:36.838]  I've actually gotten it, and I've heard Mr. Perutka on other broadcasts.
[02:26:36.878 --> 02:26:37.579]  He's a great guy.
[02:26:37.599 --> 02:26:38.699]  I think he'd make a great president.
[02:26:39.380 --> 02:26:45.305]  Right, and I have found that when I call to the syndicated and
[02:26:48.706 --> 02:26:51.988]  What she's called mainstream conservative shows around here, radio shows.
[02:26:52.028 --> 02:26:52.288]  Yes.
[02:26:52.589 --> 02:26:55.791]  They are not at all interested in hearing anything about Michael Pollan.
[02:26:55.811 --> 02:27:03.996]  Yeah, and by not giving proper attention to third world, to a third world, yeah we're a third world country, to third party candidates, they never get any power.
[02:27:04.296 --> 02:27:09.019]  We could have a third or fourth or fifth party in this country, but we won't because the media won't do it.
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:17.065]  And my question is, since you're a media man, how do we crack that conservative
[02:27:21.648 --> 02:27:22.649]  Well, they're not conservative.
[02:27:22.669 --> 02:27:23.690]  You mean the neokinds.
[02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:27.854]  Why won't they let a real conservative like Mr. Pernukov... We'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:27:27.894 --> 02:27:28.434]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:28.875 --> 02:27:30.256]  We'll take two more calls and that's it.
[02:27:30.276 --> 02:27:33.039]  Stay with us.
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:35.481]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.962 --> 02:27:37.563]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.484 --> 02:27:41.167]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.296 --> 02:27:49.966]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:27:50.487 --> 02:27:53.614]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.

[02:28:12.142 --> 02:28:16.085]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the month that it aired.

[02:28:45.189 --> 02:28:49.090]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:28:49.330 --> 02:28:54.751]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:28:55.031 --> 02:29:05.393]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:29:05.573 --> 02:29:09.894]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:10.094 --> 02:29:10.835]  We're good to go.
[02:29:25.043 --> 02:29:25.443]  I think so.
[02:29:45.911 --> 02:29:49.854]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flippin' it!
[02:29:50.155 --> 02:29:50.875]  Do you flip it?
[02:29:51.316 --> 02:29:53.638]  When I first started flippin' it, I couldn't believe my eyes!
[02:29:54.158 --> 02:29:56.160]  Once you start flippin' it, you'll never stop!
[02:29:56.704 --> 02:30:00.607]  The next time you pick up one of your beauty products, flip it over and examine the ingredients.
[02:30:00.967 --> 02:30:03.549]  You'll be astonished by what the packaging reveals to you.
[02:30:04.009 --> 02:30:08.452]  Many mainstream beauty products are comprised almost entirely of synthetic petrochemicals.

[02:30:49.329 --> 02:30:51.069]  They railed against the crown.
[02:30:51.350 --> 02:30:55.931]  They laid their bodies down.
[02:30:55.951 --> 02:30:59.231]  Thanks to the renegades.
[02:31:19.193 --> 02:31:20.434]  We're free today.
[02:31:23.535 --> 02:31:30.218]  How in the world are we letting the globalists destroy our freedoms in the name of some war against enemies they've created?
[02:31:32.579 --> 02:31:37.181]  To answer Paul's question in Maryland, how do we get around the two-party system?
[02:31:37.281 --> 02:31:40.363]  I mean, look, we've got to keep our vote in place to begin with.
[02:31:40.383 --> 02:31:45.565]  We've got to get these electronic voting machines removed from the 32% of the country they've been put into.
[02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:49.742]  We've got to block it going into other areas, which you can do now.
[02:31:49.842 --> 02:31:53.444]  People know that there's a, quote, problem with the machines.
[02:31:53.464 --> 02:31:55.045]  A lot of people know that they're a total fraud.
[02:31:55.546 --> 02:31:56.566]  We've got to defeat that.
[02:31:57.587 --> 02:32:02.230]  And we have got to develop and strengthen our own alternative media, which is happening.
[02:32:02.250 --> 02:32:05.372]  45% of people in major studies have now left the mainstream media.
[02:32:05.752 --> 02:32:10.555]  That's why they're panicking right now and trying to carry out terror attacks, in part to get you back into the mainstream.
[02:32:11.195 --> 02:32:12.976]  This is all part of a corralling process.
[02:32:12.996 --> 02:32:15.238]  So there is a renaissance and awakening against it.
[02:32:15.658 --> 02:32:17.480]  But they're turning the heat up to counter that.
[02:32:17.540 --> 02:32:20.282]  We're in a knock-down, drag-out fight here.
[02:32:20.783 --> 02:32:23.004]  I personally say forget the presidential election.
[02:32:23.045 --> 02:32:28.509]  I think people like Michael Peruca are good because they're out traveling, educating people, giving folks alternative views.
[02:32:28.809 --> 02:32:32.032]  But the mainstream media just ignores them, which defeats a lot of the purpose.
[02:32:32.833 --> 02:32:35.795]  But I think locally you can have a bigger effect running for office.
[02:32:36.756 --> 02:32:39.437]  Who knows, maybe even be secret about what you really believe.
[02:32:39.457 --> 02:32:41.337]  That may be how you have to get elected.
[02:32:41.897 --> 02:32:44.498]  Literal moles, you know, trying to get into office.
[02:32:46.299 --> 02:32:50.860]  I'm not saying lie, but just don't be totally specific on some of the things you plan to do.
[02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:52.780]  And then once you get in, you know, that's what they do.
[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:55.081]  They lie and say they're good and then get in their bad.
[02:32:55.441 --> 02:32:59.222]  We have to just kind of leave it, oh, get into office and then do the right thing.
[02:32:59.962 --> 02:33:01.603]  Paul, do you get where I'm going with all of this?
[02:33:02.651 --> 02:33:07.175]  Yeah, I mean, the call mentioned how we can support third party candidates.
[02:33:07.816 --> 02:33:22.330]  In a sense, it's a shame that Aaron Russo didn't get the Libertarian party nomination because he already had the kind of high profile which would automatically get him into those situations whereby his platform would be quite large and he had a good policy base.
[02:33:22.911 --> 02:33:27.215]  But on the flip side, I mean, the Libertarian guy that's in there, Badnarek,
[02:33:28.010 --> 02:33:31.713]  He's actually quite good on the issues, although he'll avoid the issue on abortion.
[02:33:32.093 --> 02:33:37.857]  He has worked hard to get that nomination, and he travels the country teaching constitutional classes.
[02:33:38.417 --> 02:33:47.944]  So, um, either way, I think they got a good man in there, whether it would have been Rousseau, but in bad Narek, I mean, if you can give him a good platform, then he's solid on the issues.
[02:33:48.745 --> 02:33:50.446]  Other than abortion, which is a big one.
[02:33:51.849 --> 02:34:00.959]  Yeah, I think, as you said, privately, some people don't espouse their beliefs because it may help them get nominations or get into office and I think that's the case with Badnarek.
[02:34:00.999 --> 02:34:06.585]  I think if you asked him privately, he wouldn't be against abortion, but publicly... Oh, no, Michael, he's from Austin.
[02:34:06.605 --> 02:34:08.347]  I mean, he's been on my TV show and...
[02:34:09.005 --> 02:34:10.947]  He's a good guy, but I don't agree with him on that.
[02:34:11.847 --> 02:34:13.108]  I like Mr. Perutka.
[02:34:13.128 --> 02:34:16.451]  I think he's great, but unfortunately there's no infrastructure.
[02:34:16.491 --> 02:34:17.912]  We just have to build that infrastructure.
[02:34:18.253 --> 02:34:25.899]  Real quick, I've got to move faster because I've got news I want to cover with Paul about the CIA and Goss and the rest of it and the nuke situation.
[02:34:26.519 --> 02:34:27.780]  Don in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:34:28.100 --> 02:34:28.761]  This is Dan.
[02:34:29.001 --> 02:34:29.642]  Okay, Dan.
[02:34:29.662 --> 02:34:31.363]  I can't ever seem to get names straight.
[02:34:31.403 --> 02:34:33.525]  I'll take you another direction real quick here.
[02:34:33.825 --> 02:34:35.707]  I saw a movie a couple days ago.
[02:34:35.727 --> 02:34:36.847]  I read it from the video store.
[02:34:37.048 --> 02:34:38.489]  Have you ever seen The Siege?
[02:34:39.881 --> 02:34:42.362]  Oh yeah, that's what Tommy Franks came out and said.
[02:34:42.402 --> 02:34:46.144]  Martial law, you know, it's sad to say, but the people may want it to keep safe.
[02:34:46.684 --> 02:34:48.805]  Equaling, hey, martial law keeps you safe.
[02:34:48.845 --> 02:34:50.966]  And he said, you know, like the siege.
[02:34:51.387 --> 02:34:53.788]  And it showed images of troops machine gunning U.S.
[02:34:53.828 --> 02:34:54.268]  buildings.
[02:34:54.628 --> 02:34:57.169]  Yeah, what it was, it was about Middle Eastern terrorists in New York.
[02:34:57.249 --> 02:34:59.210]  This is 1998, this movie came out.
[02:34:59.270 --> 02:35:05.473]  But this is, exactly, but this is what, on Fox, when they showed the interview with Franks, they showed troops blowing up U.S.
[02:35:05.513 --> 02:35:05.993]  buildings.
[02:35:07.294 --> 02:35:07.514]  Yeah.
[02:35:07.894 --> 02:35:09.015]  In the background of him talking.
[02:35:09.611 --> 02:35:15.213]  Yeah, well, the Middle Eastern terrorists, they, you know, bombed some school buses, the federal building.
[02:35:16.474 --> 02:35:24.657]  They eventually took all the Middle Eastern people that they could gather up in New York City, put them in stadiums with fences, just like you've been talking about.
[02:35:24.778 --> 02:35:30.820]  Which just so happens to be the federal plan from before 9-11, but it's not going to be Middle Easterners, folks.
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:35.162]  Yeah, exactly, but in the movie it was all Middle Eastern people because they were trying to get the terrorists.
[02:35:35.922 --> 02:35:39.245]  But, you know, they had all the innocent people in there, too.
[02:35:39.445 --> 02:35:42.067]  Obviously, most of them were innocent because they were just law-abiding citizens.
[02:35:42.387 --> 02:35:45.609]  But they were Middle Eastern descent, so they went into the prison in the stadium.
[02:35:46.110 --> 02:35:51.374]  And they had one prisoner they actually took into a jail cell kind of deal, and they tortured him.
[02:35:51.394 --> 02:35:54.296]  And he was naked, by the way, just like they did in the prisons over in Iraq.
[02:35:54.936 --> 02:35:58.799]  And they had him, you know, strapped down there, tied to a chair, and they tortured him.
[02:35:59.180 --> 02:36:01.001]  And they didn't show the torture, but you could hear it.
[02:36:01.499 --> 02:36:02.739]  Then in the end, they just shot him.
[02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:08.561]  And that was, I think, Bruce Willis that played the General of the Army when they finally got Marshall Law in and all that.
[02:36:08.621 --> 02:36:09.542]  He was in power now.
[02:36:09.702 --> 02:36:10.262]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[02:36:10.282 --> 02:36:11.002]  They killed the guy.
[02:36:11.422 --> 02:36:14.543]  Yeah, so I just wanted to bring that to your attention, to the listeners.
[02:36:14.583 --> 02:36:15.824]  They might want to pick up on that movie.
[02:36:15.844 --> 02:36:16.424]  It's a good movie.
[02:36:17.724 --> 02:36:18.825]  But it conditions people.
[02:36:19.705 --> 02:36:20.265]  Yeah, I know.
[02:36:20.285 --> 02:36:21.166]  Hi, Harry.
[02:36:21.186 --> 02:36:22.506]  Thanks for the call, Dan.
[02:36:23.546 --> 02:36:25.867]  And again, it's movies like The Long Kiss Goodnight.
[02:36:26.467 --> 02:36:28.388]  I'll tell you what, Stephanie, you had that clip.
[02:36:29.228 --> 02:36:30.889]  Will you find that Long Kiss Goodnight?
[02:36:34.428 --> 02:36:35.348]  Go ahead and play that.
[02:36:35.368 --> 02:36:36.909]  This is from 1999.
[02:36:37.009 --> 02:36:39.770]  Paul, tell folks about the actors that are in this and what they're going to say.
[02:36:40.810 --> 02:36:43.131]  Yeah, well, you've got... I forgot the black actor.
[02:36:43.151 --> 02:36:43.511]  Who is it?
[02:36:43.932 --> 02:36:44.332]  Who's in it?
[02:36:44.972 --> 02:36:46.092]  I forget that's the problem.
[02:36:46.132 --> 02:36:48.453]  I was trying to get him to... I like him.
[02:36:48.493 --> 02:36:50.594]  He's a great actor, but I can't remember his name for some reason.
[02:36:51.664 --> 02:36:54.466]  Yeah, well, anyway, it was the guy who was in Pulp Fiction as well.
[02:36:55.147 --> 02:37:08.236]  And, um, I think it's the Overlord, the government agent who is trying to get his funding through, says to him that the, um, 93 World Trade Center bombing was basically carried out by the, um, FBI and CIA.
[02:37:08.336 --> 02:37:15.801]  Which was a true story admitted in major newspapers, so they mixed that, then he says we're gonna blow it up totally this time to get our funding.
[02:37:16.736 --> 02:37:23.202]  Yeah, and he says he doesn't know how to stage the terrorist attack, so he's just going to have to do it for real to get his funding.
[02:37:23.882 --> 02:37:34.411]  And then on top of that, we also have the lone gunman months before 9-11 on Fox, where a secret government group hijacks a jet to fly to the World Trade Center to get martial law.
[02:37:34.671 --> 02:37:36.793]  But go ahead and play the clip from The Long Kiska Night.
[02:37:38.154 --> 02:37:40.917]  Is that a phone ringer?
[02:37:40.977 --> 02:37:42.798]  Here it is.
[02:37:42.818 --> 02:37:42.798]  1993.
[02:37:42.858 --> 02:37:44.199]  World Trade Center bombing.
[02:37:44.339 --> 02:37:44.720]  Remember?
[02:37:45.595 --> 02:37:46.896]  Uh, Stephanie, do we have that clip?
[02:37:50.878 --> 02:37:52.578]  Oh, I understand now.
[02:37:52.598 --> 02:37:53.839]  This is not feeding to me.
[02:37:54.479 --> 02:37:59.822]  He's a fundraiser?
[02:37:59.842 --> 02:37:59.822]  1993.
[02:38:01.363 --> 02:38:02.903]  World Trade Center bombing.
[02:38:03.063 --> 02:38:03.404]  Remember?
[02:38:05.765 --> 02:38:09.627]  During the trial, one of the bombers claimed the CIA had advanced knowledge.
[02:38:13.075 --> 02:38:16.057]  The diplomat who issued the terrorist visa was CIA.
[02:38:16.957 --> 02:38:22.280]  It's not unthinkable they paved the way for the bombing, purely to justify a budget increase.
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:27.383]  You're telling me that you're going to fake some terrorist thing just to get some money out of Congress?
[02:38:27.463 --> 02:38:31.605]  Well, unfortunately, Mr. Hennessey, I have no idea how to fake killing 4,000 people.
[02:38:33.146 --> 02:38:34.747]  So we're just going to have to do it for real.
[02:38:36.508 --> 02:38:38.729]  Oh, blame it on the Muslims, naturally.
[02:38:39.369 --> 02:38:40.450]  Then I get my funding.
[02:38:41.691 --> 02:38:42.331]  Good night, old girl.
[02:38:45.096 --> 02:38:54.381]  Sorry about that, folks.
[02:38:54.421 --> 02:38:55.221]  She was playing the clip.
[02:38:55.261 --> 02:39:03.406]  I couldn't hear it, so I thought we had dead air, so we started the clip over again in mid-flight, but, um... Paul, it doesn't get any more in your face than that, does it?
[02:39:04.126 --> 02:39:04.347]  No.
[02:39:04.847 --> 02:39:07.028]  The actor is Samuel L. Jackson, obviously.
[02:39:07.248 --> 02:39:08.289]  Yeah, Samuel L. Jackson.
[02:39:08.849 --> 02:39:11.050]  Very interesting how movies do mirror reality.
[02:39:11.070 --> 02:39:13.552]  I watched a movie on Saturday night, which was about how
[02:39:14.335 --> 02:39:18.479]  Terrorists smuggled a nerve gas bomb on board a commercial airliner.
[02:39:19.501 --> 02:39:24.446]  In the script, it later turned out that the main terrorist was actually working for British Intelligence.
[02:39:24.766 --> 02:39:27.929]  So, in many cases, they do blow the whistle on this kind of thing.
[02:39:28.590 --> 02:39:35.858]  And in many other worrying cases, movies do go on to become reality in later months, as we saw with the lone gunman situation.
[02:39:37.068 --> 02:39:43.974]  Well, we had Philips changing the way you live in your world, or changing your world, a Philips TV ad.
[02:39:43.994 --> 02:39:46.396]  I have the AP article, I've never seen the ad.
[02:39:46.816 --> 02:39:52.681]  And it describes F-16s bombing both towers and saying, Philips, changing the way you live your world.
[02:39:53.001 --> 02:39:54.683]  What in the world is that?
[02:39:55.632 --> 02:40:09.375]  Well, I mean right down to those Illuminati playing cards, which are part of a board game, two of which showed the World Trade Center exploding in the exact spot on the South Tower where the plane hit and the Pentagon being attacked as well.
[02:40:09.695 --> 02:40:16.477]  And then we have the rap band The Coup showing the towers exploding in the very same spots.
[02:40:17.268 --> 02:40:30.336]  Yeah, there's a whole section in the 9-11 Archive, which is obviously right at the bottom, because this isn't solid proof of the events of that day, but it's just interesting to consider, called Anecdotal Prior Knowledge, and that's in the 9-11 Archive on the website.
[02:40:30.516 --> 02:40:35.119]  Alright, we're going to just take one final call, and be quick, John in Ohio, go ahead.
[02:40:35.719 --> 02:40:42.363]  Yeah, I was glad that Paul clarified the disinformation that the corporate CIA media is peddling about Venezuela.
[02:40:43.067 --> 02:40:58.750]  But there's an even greater elaboration of this on ZMAG.org by Greg Pallast, how the United States, contrary to that color, is rigging the vote there, and in case it can't do that, is intending on totally discrediting it.
[02:40:59.291 --> 02:41:09.893]  He points out on this article on ZMAG.org that Venezuela lordated, well the gang that fixed the Florida vote, fixed the vote in Caracas this Sunday, and he points out that
[02:41:11.706 --> 02:41:20.913]  The CIA and Homeland Security have been using Choice Point, the same gang that Bush used to rig the vote in Florida now, under the guise of a war on terrorism.
[02:41:20.973 --> 02:41:22.374]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:41:22.414 --> 02:41:32.022]  The only places that the United States is sending these Choice Point lists, private lists of citizens in these countries, have nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:41:32.082 --> 02:41:39.988]  It's only where there are contested votes, contested elections, where the United States and the globalists are opposing
[02:41:40.675 --> 02:41:48.898]  The candidates, whether it's in Brazil or Venezuela or these other countries, and in effect they're using that the same way they used it in Florida.
[02:41:48.918 --> 02:42:05.584]  And then also there's another article about how even the New York Times and the other media, which totally ignores the fraudulent voting machines in this country, are trying to use this false disinformation that somehow it's going to be used in Venezuela.
[02:42:05.604 --> 02:42:06.865]  But even the Carter Commission
[02:42:07.438 --> 02:42:15.201]  Pointed out that it has a very secure system, security measures, and a paper receipt trail, which they were very impressed with.
[02:42:15.521 --> 02:42:16.422]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:42:16.462 --> 02:42:17.903]  I appreciate it.
[02:42:18.983 --> 02:42:26.886]  Paul, let's cover this now, and then we'll get into Porter Goss, kind of his background and his new domestic stasi, but let me read this real quick.
[02:42:26.906 --> 02:42:28.027]  This is out of the New York Times.
[02:42:28.787 --> 02:42:30.708]  An American Hiroshima is possible.
[02:42:30.988 --> 02:42:32.869]  Reposted in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[02:42:34.108 --> 02:42:43.594]  If a 10 kiloton nuclear weapon, a midget, even smaller than the one that destroyed Hiroshima, exploded in Times Square, the fireball would reach tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:42:43.934 --> 02:42:52.019]  It would vaporize or destroy the Theater District, Madison Square Garden, the Empire State Building, Grand Central Terminal, and Carnegie Hall, along with me and my building.
[02:42:52.559 --> 02:42:56.382]  The blast would partly destroy as much larger area, including the United Nations.
[02:42:56.942 --> 02:42:59.463]  On a weekday, some 500,000 people would be killed.
[02:42:59.604 --> 02:43:00.244]  Could this happen?
[02:43:01.073 --> 02:43:05.276]  Unfortunately it could, and many experts believe that such an attack somewhere is likely.
[02:43:05.737 --> 02:43:06.337]  Now listen to this.
[02:43:06.377 --> 02:43:08.839]  He acts like this is all real, then later admits it's fake.
[02:43:08.919 --> 02:43:10.401]  This is a psychological warfare piece.
[02:43:10.981 --> 02:43:19.288]  The Aspen Strategy Group, a bipartisan assortment of policy mavens, focused on nuclear risk at its annual meeting here last week, and the consensus was two-fold.
[02:43:19.368 --> 02:43:24.772]  The danger of nuclear terrorism is much greater than the public believes, and our government hasn't done nearly enough to reduce it.
[02:43:25.433 --> 02:43:33.515]  Graham Allison, a Harvard professor, whose terrifying new book, Nuclear Terrorism, offers the example cited above, noted that he did not pluck it from the thin air.
[02:43:33.955 --> 02:43:47.897]  He writes that on October 11, 2001, exactly a month after 9-11, aides told President Bush that a CIA source code named Dragonfire had reported that Al-Qaeda had obtained a 10 kiloton nuclear weapon and smuggled it into New York City.
[02:43:48.638 --> 02:43:50.398]  The CIA found the report plausible.
[02:43:51.167 --> 02:43:56.769]  The weapon, supposedly, had been stolen from Russia, which indeed has many ten kiloton weapons.
[02:43:56.909 --> 02:44:08.392]  Russia is reported to have lost, sure, some of its nuclear materials, and Al-Qaeda has not a determined effort to get or make such a weapon, and the CIA has picked up Al-Qaeda chatter about an American Hiroshima.
[02:44:08.572 --> 02:44:17.615]  President Bush dispatched nuclear experts to New York to search for the weapons, and sent Dick Cheney and other officials out of town to ensure the continuity of government in case a weapon exploded in D.C.
[02:44:19.674 --> 02:44:25.301]  Instead, but to avoid panic, the White House told no one in New York City, not even Mayor Giuliani.
[02:44:25.341 --> 02:44:37.997]  Dragonfire report was wrong, but similar reports that Al-Qaeda has its hands on a nuclear weapon from the former Soviet Union regularly have surfaced, through disinfo people I would add, in the intelligence community, even though such a report has never been confirmed.
[02:44:38.539 --> 02:44:40.200]  We do know several troubling things.
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:49.485]  Al Qaeda negotiated for a 1.5 million purchase of uranium, apparently of South African origin, from a retired Sudanese cabinet minister.
[02:44:49.905 --> 02:44:51.286]  That's been admitted to be fake, too.
[02:44:51.726 --> 02:44:56.929]  Its envoys traveled repeatedly to Central Asia to buy weapons-grade nuclear materials, and it goes on and on.
[02:44:56.989 --> 02:45:05.554]  So what they're trying to do is create fear here in a ledger or a history, so when the globalists carry this out, we'll all think that Al Qaeda did it.
[02:45:05.794 --> 02:45:06.034]  Paul?
[02:45:06.963 --> 02:45:10.044]  Well, you said that this came out of what, the Aspen Institute?
[02:45:11.004 --> 02:45:11.324]  Yes.
[02:45:11.984 --> 02:45:15.685]  The Aspen Institute is basically an arm of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:45:15.725 --> 02:45:25.867]  I mean, their CEO, I think it's Walter Isaacson, CEO of Aspen, is at the Bilderberg meeting almost every year, and he was at the recent one in Italy.
[02:45:26.107 --> 02:45:29.768]  So just from that we see, you know, where these people's loyalties lie.
[02:45:30.498 --> 02:45:37.700]  But even if it is possible that this would happen, then we have to look back at who's laying the pathway for it to happen.
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:46.922]  Khan, the Pakistani scientist who was selling nukes to countries and terrorist groups all over the world, was in the enclave of the Bushes before they cut him loose.
[02:45:46.962 --> 02:45:51.183]  And Bush ordered NW-199I, not just the hijackers, to be protected, but also Khan.
[02:45:52.163 --> 02:45:55.904]  Yeah, as Greg Pallas reported, you know, before they cut him loose and made him this
[02:45:56.622 --> 02:46:12.015]  uh... individual criminal uh... they were very sure to distance him from the Bush family first of which he was intimately involved with so I mean it underlines the fact that it's entirely possible for individuals within this within the U.S.
[02:46:12.095 --> 02:46:20.381]  to do this who have the capability just the door needs to be left open for them to do it which is what they do by all these people I mean watch
[02:46:22.443 --> 02:46:25.046]  Watch your bosses right before they put out a terror alert.
[02:46:25.126 --> 02:46:25.927]  Watch the stocks.
[02:46:26.007 --> 02:46:28.991]  Watch them invest and put options, just like they did on 9-11.
[02:46:29.411 --> 02:46:36.339]  And if you really want to stop terrorism, look for key areas to double their insurance two or three weeks before this happens.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:41.165]  And look for the bushes to have family members running security in the area where the newt goes off.
[02:46:42.532 --> 02:46:54.975]  Yeah, I mean, Bush's brother, Marvin Bush, the contract lease on the World Trade Center expiring on September 11th, I mean, the put options on American United Airlines, they're the things to watch to give you an indicator of what's about to happen.
[02:46:55.455 --> 02:47:00.676]  But, I mean, they don't even have to directly detonate a nuke and then blame it on somebody else.
[02:47:00.716 --> 02:47:06.138]  They can just have the people, their patsies, do it for them, even if those terrorists are unaware of it.
[02:47:06.178 --> 02:47:11.099]  And they can also go in and machine gun the guys and deactivate it and have a big circus.
[02:47:12.443 --> 02:47:13.124]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:13.304 --> 02:47:28.855]  I mean, as with the First World Trade Center bombing, many of the terrorists within that group weren't even aware of the fact that the bombing was paved for by the CIA and the material, which was supposed to be dummy explosives, was exchanged for real explosives.
[02:47:29.015 --> 02:47:30.796]  And I mean, they were retarded individuals.
[02:47:30.816 --> 02:47:32.878]  They didn't even know what they were doing, basically.
[02:47:33.278 --> 02:47:36.760]  So it underlines the fact that they don't have to directly carry this out.
[02:47:36.780 --> 02:47:37.261]  They can just
[02:47:38.101 --> 02:47:38.982]  We're good to go.
[02:47:59.745 --> 02:48:06.811]  That barring radical new anti-proliferation steps, a terrorist nuclear strike will occur somewhere in the world in the next 10 years.
[02:48:06.932 --> 02:48:07.872]  So I took his bet.
[02:48:08.353 --> 02:48:12.336]  If there is no such nuclear attack by August 2014, he owes me $5.10.
[02:48:12.376 --> 02:48:13.617]  If there is an attack, I owe him $4.90.
[02:48:18.462 --> 02:48:22.064]  I took the bet because I don't think the odds of nuclear terror are quite as great as he does.
[02:48:22.544 --> 02:48:26.827]  And then he goes on to say, unfortunately, plenty of smart people think I've made a bad bet.
[02:48:27.107 --> 02:48:32.510]  William Perry, the former Secretary of Defense, says there is an even greater chance of a nuclear terror strike in the next decade.
[02:48:33.090 --> 02:48:34.731]  This is in the next six years.
[02:48:35.071 --> 02:48:35.631]  We'll be back.
[02:48:36.052 --> 02:48:36.532]  Stay with us.
[02:48:36.572 --> 02:48:37.232]  Final segment.
[02:48:37.252 --> 02:48:39.073]  Talk about Porter Goss with Paul Watson.
[02:48:39.313 --> 02:48:39.914]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:44.474 --> 02:48:48.819]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:48.999 --> 02:48:53.344]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:48:57.961]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:57.981 --> 02:49:00.902]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:49:01.122 --> 02:49:05.344]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:05.404 --> 02:49:12.326]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:12.466 --> 02:49:14.467]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:14.707 --> 02:49:25.293]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:25.453 --> 02:49:30.857]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:49:45.827 --> 02:49:49.950]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:50.070 --> 02:49:52.953]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:53.033 --> 02:49:59.759]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:49:59.939 --> 02:50:02.942]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:03.162 --> 02:50:05.544]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:05.665 --> 02:50:10.409]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:50:10.589 --> 02:50:25.133]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Apcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum aren't extracted.

[02:51:51.534 --> 02:51:54.815]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.315 --> 02:52:00.016]  Alright, our final segment with Paul Watson.
[02:52:00.216 --> 02:52:02.917]  This New York Times scaremongering piece continues.
[02:52:03.297 --> 02:52:10.119]  For the first page, they act like everything's real and we're about to be attacked and say, oh, it was a fake report issued by our globalist rulers.
[02:52:10.599 --> 02:52:15.440]  Quote, we're racing towards unprecedented catastrophe, former Secretary of Defense Perry warns.
[02:52:18.075 --> 02:52:23.037]  Then the author says the upshot is the risk of a nuclear explosion will devastate a U.S.
[02:52:23.077 --> 02:52:27.438]  city is greater now than it was during the Cold War and is growing.
[02:52:27.578 --> 02:52:30.119]  So, boy, we're in greater danger now.
[02:52:30.199 --> 02:52:34.820]  We've got to have nice men in black ski masks take all our freedoms away, Paul, so they can keep us safe.
[02:52:37.063 --> 02:52:41.267]  As most of you listeners know, the New York Times is the mouthpiece for the New World Order.
[02:52:41.667 --> 02:52:48.073]  They carried for months on end Shalibi's so-called evidence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
[02:52:48.153 --> 02:52:52.437]  So, there's no liberal media conspiracy against the Bush administration.
[02:52:52.477 --> 02:53:00.244]  They're supporting the Bush administration by acting as a mouthpiece for the police state measures that they need the fear-mongering to pass.
[02:53:00.504 --> 02:53:00.965]  That's right.
[02:53:01.025 --> 02:53:12.067]  Now, Porter Goss, you have an AP article posted and others, will they just come right out and say, domestic CIA to arrest citizens for any reason and they're going to be running our lives and he's got the bill introduced.
[02:53:12.842 --> 02:53:33.113]  Well, isn't it interesting that nearly two months before Bush nominated him for Director of the CIA, he introduces this legislation which, according to Newsweek, would give the President new authority to direct CIA agents to conduct law enforcement operations inside the United States, including arresting American citizens.
[02:53:33.753 --> 02:53:33.933]  In fact,
[02:53:58.107 --> 02:53:59.227]  In fact, we have that clip.
[02:53:59.267 --> 02:54:01.468]  It's going to be separate from Congress, by the way, folks.
[02:54:01.928 --> 02:54:03.929]  Just like our trade and everything else and our borders.
[02:54:04.689 --> 02:54:06.150]  Stephanie, do you have that clip of Goss?
[02:54:07.850 --> 02:54:08.650]  Of Porter Goss.
[02:54:08.670 --> 02:54:11.111]  You know the clip where he talks about Big Brother or Dead Brother?
[02:54:12.432 --> 02:54:13.112]  Can we play that?
[02:54:14.532 --> 02:54:14.912]  You got it?
[02:54:15.573 --> 02:54:16.193]  Go ahead and hit it.
[02:54:17.438 --> 02:54:21.882]  The purpose of the United States of America is to be respected for what we are.
[02:54:22.342 --> 02:54:28.427]  Goss also weighed in on the age-old debate of preserving civil liberties versus protecting national security.
[02:54:28.687 --> 02:54:38.235]  We're talking about the balance between privacy on the one hand and protection from big brother government, but we're also talking about the government's responsibility to protect our people.
[02:54:38.515 --> 02:54:44.840]  It comes down to the choice, as my staff has said to me many times, between big brother and dead brother.
[02:54:45.413 --> 02:54:49.617]  And I think our first responsibility in government is to make sure we don't have any more Death Brothers.
[02:54:50.378 --> 02:54:53.981]  Oh, so we've got to give up our liberty for security, but you give up liberty, you get tyranny.
[02:54:54.041 --> 02:54:56.964]  So, this is amazing and the Democrats love it, gosh.
[02:54:57.184 --> 02:54:58.806]  Paul, thank you for coming on.

[02:56:19.716 --> 02:56:21.077]  We've got to expose the terrorists.
[02:56:21.097 --> 02:56:22.357]  We've got to expose the killers.
[02:56:22.857 --> 02:56:28.280]  If we just sit here and take it and let them pose as the good guys, it's over for our civilization and our children's futures.
[02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:30.240]  So stand up against the New World Order.
[02:56:30.501 --> 02:56:31.281]  God bless you all.
[02:56:31.301 --> 02:56:32.401]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
