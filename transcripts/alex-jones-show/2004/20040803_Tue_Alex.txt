[00:00:06.428 --> 00:00:07.069]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:08.790]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.611]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:12.092]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:13.733]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.753 --> 00:00:18.236]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.596 --> 00:00:22.659]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:39.527]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:45.995]  Welcome to this Tuesday, the 3rd of August, 2004 edition of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:52.942]  We have the President of the American Library Association coming on in the third hour.
[00:00:54.183 --> 00:00:59.049]  Under the Patriot Act, they're not just getting all the records of what you read and do at the library.
[00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.922]  They also do that at the bookstores, by the way, but the bookstores haven't complained, so most Americans don't know about it.
[00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:11.106]  There's been maybe one article for every hundred about that, that there have been concerning the libraries.
[00:01:11.227 --> 00:01:23.795]  But now, under the Patriot Act, and I'm looking at the library associations, the National Library Association's own press release, they're getting the constitutional material, the federal laws,
[00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:30.592]  And they're demanding that all of that be shredded and destroyed out of every library in the country.
[00:01:32.152 --> 00:01:40.517]  We've seen past reports of them getting rid of constitutional materials, law books, out of libraries.
[00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:47.160]  And we've seen them raid people who put out government documents concerning the IRS.
[00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:51.806]  So they're definitely afraid, folks.
[00:01:51.926 --> 00:01:59.107]  I mean, when the government starts not wanting you to know what the laws are, you know you're dealing with big, fat tyranny.
[00:02:00.748 --> 00:02:04.229]  The feds have also moved to remove this stuff off their own websites.
[00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:06.889]  So you don't even know what the law is.
[00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:08.670]  You're starting to figure this out, folks.
[00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.990]  So that's coming up in the third hour.
[00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.151]  You do not want to miss it.
[00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:18.312]  In the meantime, we're going to have wide open phones and a ton of news.
[00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:31.112]  Bush calls for Intelligence Director and listeners called in yesterday wanting to know specifics of this and I had just heard it on the radio and seen it on TV and had one Associated Press report concerning it.
[00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:37.595]  Now I have the AP, I have CNN, I have Public Radio and Reuters.
[00:02:38.664 --> 00:02:39.445]  Here's CNN.
[00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:42.247]  Bush calls for intelligence czar or king.
[00:02:42.988 --> 00:02:45.350]  Absolute despot is the dictionary definition.
[00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.014]  President embraces key suggestion of 9-11 Commission.
[00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:51.735]  They've been wanting this for years, folks.
[00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:54.578]  So we'll go over that for you.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.066]  I put out a little press release yesterday along with Governor Ridge's fear-mongering from Sunday that financial institutions would be hit
[00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:11.251]  And I said, look for put options, look for currency manipulation, look for some type of economic game for the globalists.
[00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:22.259]  The dollar plunged to all-time lows, crude exploded to all-time total complete record highs at 44 plus dollars per barrel.
[00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:29.383]  And now they're going to have the CIA take more control of the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:03:29.463 --> 00:03:39.308]  Almost every director of the Stock Exchange has been a former spook of the CIA, but now they're going to make the whole thing electronic so they fully control that fraud-based system.
[00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.191]  And it turns out, now when I heard all this Sunday, I said, you know, I've heard this before.
[00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:52.814]  World Bank, IMF, New York Stock Exchange, they're the targets.
[00:03:55.507 --> 00:04:00.051]  I've heard this before, that Al-Qaeda had maps of it and stuff, and guess what?
[00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:01.592]  I was right!
[00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:21.768]  This is three years old, older than 9-11, some pamphlet one of their CIA people left behind as some type of fear-mongering setup three years ago, and so you hear the headlines, see the headlines, oh man, the financial workers are standing firm in the face of Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.851]  Turns out it's three years old, folks.
[00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:31.248]  In fact, I did a search and found articles from three years ago saying the exact same thing.
[00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.692]  Minus orange alerts and the rest of it.
[00:04:38.573 --> 00:04:44.697]  So we'll dive into all of this and more on the other side of this quick break and then we'll take your calls.
[00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:46.846]  at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:57.079]  Don't forget the websites, InfoWars.com, updated daily, PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:58.781]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.378 --> 00:05:09.863]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:10.303 --> 00:05:14.848]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.968 --> 00:05:21.814]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:22.194 --> 00:05:28.280]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.661]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:32.945]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:33.085 --> 00:05:35.047]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:35.428 --> 00:05:42.656]  Biosolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.957 --> 00:05:46.341]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:02.650]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.550]  Terrorism!
[00:06:03.631 --> 00:06:09.715]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:11.557]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:11.797 --> 00:06:14.279]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:29.231]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:29.591]  government.
[00:06:29.772 --> 00:06:31.493]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:37.857]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:42.501]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:02.501]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:02.681 --> 00:07:05.764]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:05.904 --> 00:07:09.808]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:09.848 --> 00:07:14.133]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:18.197]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:18.297 --> 00:07:20.159]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:23.640]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.402]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:28.562 --> 00:07:31.603]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:34.644]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:41.247]  The neighbors in that area, Sandpoint Naval Air Station, were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:41.787 --> 00:07:45.569]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:47.350]  Order your video today.

[00:07:52.353 --> 00:07:52.693]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:08.806]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.526 --> 00:08:10.647]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:12.107]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.848 --> 00:08:13.728]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.408 --> 00:08:18.070]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:22.713]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.092 --> 00:08:46.465]  Well, well, well, if you're joining us for the first time, and I know that every hour thousands of new people tune in on the AM and FM shortwave internet satellite, if you're joining us for the first time, you have run smack dab, head on, into the truth.
[00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:57.133]  We understand history, we know there's a world government, we know it's upon us, we know it's tyrannical, we know America is being dismantled, wrecked,
[00:08:57.723 --> 00:08:58.363]  Raised.
[00:08:58.583 --> 00:08:59.104]  Crushed.
[00:08:59.424 --> 00:09:00.264]  Decimated.
[00:09:01.665 --> 00:09:02.465]  Annihilated.
[00:09:04.306 --> 00:09:05.006]  Smashed.
[00:09:06.887 --> 00:09:13.270]  And we're angry about it, my friends, and we know that the Republican and Democratic parties in this country are totally controlled.
[00:09:15.051 --> 00:09:17.332]  And we have long-term memories.
[00:09:17.572 --> 00:09:22.594]  We chronicle the lies and propaganda of the New World Order.
[00:09:22.634 --> 00:09:24.815]  We engage in the information war.
[00:09:26.261 --> 00:09:32.167]  Using our ultimate weapon, the truth, to smash their mountains of lies.
[00:09:32.568 --> 00:09:35.151]  To cut through the disinformation.
[00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:42.518]  To focus in on real issues of significance that truly affect you and your family.
[00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:48.805]  This broadcast is not left-wing or right-wing, it's pro-truth, anti-lie.
[00:09:51.909 --> 00:09:53.270]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.031]  I believe in national sovereignty.
[00:09:55.131 --> 00:09:56.292]  I believe in the family.
[00:09:56.712 --> 00:09:58.693]  I believe in state sovereignty.
[00:09:58.853 --> 00:10:01.095]  I believe in dignity and honor.
[00:10:01.555 --> 00:10:07.779]  And I hate corruption and I hate bullies and serial killers and all their servants.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.521]  And I hope you'll join us.
[00:10:11.621 --> 00:10:12.902]  I hope you'll have an open mind.
[00:10:13.002 --> 00:10:21.347]  I hope you'll, again, read history and then look at what's happening today and get out of your deep, willful denial
[00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:26.503]  Alright, again, InfoWars.com has been updated daily for you.
[00:10:26.883 --> 00:10:32.125]  Normally PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are, but our webmaster's been on vacation last week.
[00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:33.606]  I'm told he gets back tonight or tomorrow.
[00:10:34.886 --> 00:10:40.128]  But those sites both have a political news retrospective from the last year up.
[00:10:40.168 --> 00:10:45.311]  A lot of the most horrifying articles and stories and Big Brother activities, so it's well worth a visit.
[00:10:45.371 --> 00:10:48.572]  But InfoWars.com is freshly updated for you daily.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:58.685]  And coming up in the third hour, I have the President of the American Library Association joining us about what the Patriot Act is doing in the libraries.
[00:10:58.926 --> 00:11:01.407]  And by the way, it's not just spying on what you read.
[00:11:03.469 --> 00:11:04.769]  And it's the bookstores as well.
[00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.473]  No, it's shredding federal laws.
[00:11:11.154 --> 00:11:13.495]  Shredding information on asset forfeiture.
[00:11:13.956 --> 00:11:16.838]  Shredding information on constitutional law, common law.
[00:11:17.158 --> 00:11:19.359]  They're ordering federal laws and
[00:11:21.068 --> 00:11:24.809]  Uh, rulings, case law to be destroyed.
[00:11:25.489 --> 00:11:28.030]  To be removed and destroyed.
[00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.231]  Not given away for free, not stored somewhere else.
[00:11:30.671 --> 00:11:32.011]  Taken out of the stacks.
[00:11:33.032 --> 00:11:37.033]  You know, most of the stuff you see in the library, that's just a small portion of the stacks.
[00:11:37.873 --> 00:11:39.474]  Well, they want it out of the stacks.
[00:11:40.194 --> 00:11:41.714]  Even where researchers can go.
[00:11:41.794 --> 00:11:43.975]  They don't want you having access to it.
[00:11:45.555 --> 00:11:47.697]  They don't want you to know what the laws are.
[00:11:47.757 --> 00:11:49.078]  You go, what does that mean?
[00:11:49.398 --> 00:11:52.661]  Because all the time they put people in prison for not even violating the law, folks.
[00:11:54.462 --> 00:11:55.883]  Let me give you a local example.
[00:11:55.963 --> 00:11:57.304]  You're late to class three times.
[00:11:57.324 --> 00:11:58.185]  It's been on the news.
[00:11:59.126 --> 00:12:00.267]  You're put on probation.
[00:12:00.327 --> 00:12:02.168]  No judge, no jury, no trial.
[00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:03.429]  They just say sign here.
[00:12:03.529 --> 00:12:04.450]  People don't know their rights.
[00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:05.671]  They sign there.
[00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:07.152]  They're in the criminal justice system.
[00:12:09.073 --> 00:12:12.076]  In about 40% of the cases, they end up going to juvenile hall.
[00:12:12.416 --> 00:12:16.419]  We're talking about B-plus students who've never been in trouble.
[00:12:19.101 --> 00:12:19.662]  It's that simple.
[00:12:21.303 --> 00:12:22.344]  They are the criminals.
[00:12:22.404 --> 00:12:23.965]  The government has gone criminal.
[00:12:24.045 --> 00:12:25.026]  It's gone rogue.
[00:12:25.126 --> 00:12:26.067]  It's the norm.
[00:12:26.387 --> 00:12:28.209]  It's what always happens.
[00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.972]  It is what we face 98% of the time in history.
[00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:58.846]  And we've got a yuppie, know-it-all, hippie, neocon, giggling moron, junior high mentality society that laughs and says government's never been corrupt, there should be no oversight, to say government's corrupt and out of control and engage in subterfuge is a conspiracy theory, government is God, the state is God, shut up!
[00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:02.288]  There's no world government as presidents and prime ministers
[00:13:04.472 --> 00:13:07.075]  And premiers call for it.
[00:13:09.418 --> 00:13:13.242]  As the Supreme Court says they're under you in control, it doesn't exist.
[00:13:13.562 --> 00:13:19.669]  As they announce microchips for the police and old people and criminals, it doesn't exist, it's not happening.
[00:13:19.929 --> 00:13:25.756]  As your cell phone tracks and traces and listens to you, it doesn't exist, even as it's announced federally.
[00:13:27.148 --> 00:13:35.470]  As scanners that look through your walls are mounted on all the helicopters, for the police departments, by the defense department, you talk about it, it's denied!
[00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:51.793]  As the government moves forward to forcibly, psychologically test every child, and then starting with pregnant women, then every adult, and then to forcibly put 15% of us, they say to begin with, on anti-psychotics, as it's announced, it doesn't exist.
[00:13:53.413 --> 00:13:56.214]  So just keep on denying all day long.
[00:13:58.926 --> 00:14:00.727]  I can't believe how hellish this is.
[00:14:00.787 --> 00:14:02.267]  This is the ultimate tyranny.
[00:14:02.387 --> 00:14:04.848]  I've never seen anything like it in history.
[00:14:05.788 --> 00:14:07.289]  It is brand new.
[00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:08.309]  It is so evil.
[00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:27.215]  The good news is people are waking up as the heat gets turned up and we have just got to say no and get in government's face and just start going and attending government meetings and finding out what they're up to and researching and getting involved and educating others and saying no and adding to that
[00:14:28.231 --> 00:14:28.914]  Hell no!
[00:14:29.455 --> 00:14:32.787]  We're not going along with your criminal system!
[00:14:35.794 --> 00:14:38.575]  And they say, fine then, Al-Qaeda is going to get you.
[00:14:38.715 --> 00:14:40.476]  And we go, okay, who founded Al-Qaeda?
[00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:43.417]  Let's go back to the Washington Times, Washington Post, 1986.
[00:14:43.817 --> 00:14:45.738]  Bin Laden, the big hero.
[00:14:46.278 --> 00:14:50.980]  Let's go to 99, 98, with the Serbs being attacked by Al-Qaeda under CIA control.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.421]  Here, let's go to the fact that our government wouldn't arrest him.
[00:14:53.621 --> 00:14:55.402]  Let's go to the fact that he was flown out to safety.
[00:14:55.582 --> 00:14:58.503]  Let's go to the, let's look at who stands to gain from all this terrorism.
[00:15:02.264 --> 00:15:03.945]  Let's have long-term memories.
[00:15:04.836 --> 00:15:05.976]  And by the way, you can do that.
[00:15:06.036 --> 00:15:25.941]  If you can remember the sudden death overtime from some Super Bowl of 10 years ago, and you can remember how the running back jumped over the lineman to secure the touchdown, and how you screamed, and how your eyes bulged out of your head.
[00:15:25.961 --> 00:15:32.443]  If you can remember Pete Rose sliding into home 20 years ago,
[00:15:37.111 --> 00:15:45.097]  How can you not remember three years ago, right before 9-11, as they introduced Al-Qaeda as the new boogeyman.
[00:15:45.178 --> 00:15:45.958]  Al-Qaeda's evil.
[00:15:45.998 --> 00:15:47.659]  Look, they're tearing up Buddhist statues.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.081]  They're going to get you.
[00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:50.021]  We've got to invade them.
[00:15:50.041 --> 00:15:51.242]  They're going to strike any minute.
[00:15:51.262 --> 00:15:52.884]  Give up your freedoms when they do attack.
[00:15:53.524 --> 00:16:00.690]  By the way, we've got some of their manuals that say they want to attack the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:16:01.838 --> 00:16:07.042]  And yesterday I remembered that and today I went and looked it up and there were the articles from three years ago.
[00:16:08.443 --> 00:16:23.573]  And lo and behold it was pointed out that these were old terror alerts and that that's where they came from and that Ridge is saying specific, brand new, imminent attack this week and they knew full well it was three years old.
[00:16:26.615 --> 00:16:30.238]  But just like you remember Pete Rose and just like you remember uh...
[00:16:32.182 --> 00:16:33.423]  Roger Stolbach.
[00:16:34.664 --> 00:16:38.006]  You see, I remember what went on in the world.
[00:16:38.246 --> 00:16:40.087]  Because my family lives in this world.
[00:16:40.427 --> 00:16:41.608]  And my country lives here.
[00:16:41.848 --> 00:16:43.149]  And I'm not going to be a slave.
[00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.569]  And so I better be informed.
[00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:46.451]  And you better get informed.
[00:16:47.671 --> 00:16:51.373]  Instead, we have a public, again, on average, that doesn't know who the Vice President is.
[00:16:53.635 --> 00:16:55.316]  Who can't name five state capitals.
[00:16:55.376 --> 00:16:56.977]  Who can't find Iraq on a map.
[00:16:57.077 --> 00:16:58.918]  I mean, urban professionals can't, folks.
[00:16:59.984 --> 00:17:08.073]  Who don't know how many Senators there are, how many members of the House, who don't know what the Legislative and the Executive and the Judicial is, but they've got their opinion about politics!
[00:17:08.173 --> 00:17:09.474]  Oh, they sure do!
[00:17:12.117 --> 00:17:13.198]  See, I'm not an elitist.
[00:17:13.278 --> 00:17:15.881]  I don't have some sardonic view that you're a bunch of idiots.
[00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:17.603]  I'm scared!
[00:17:17.623 --> 00:17:18.344]  It freaks me out!
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.341]  Because I know I'm just an average guy and I know all about it.
[00:17:23.862 --> 00:17:28.003]  I know all about how government works and who operates it and what they're up to.
[00:17:28.243 --> 00:17:31.624]  And I sit here in horror watching this country being dismantled.
[00:17:34.665 --> 00:17:37.266]  And I'm begging you to start thinking for yourselves out there.
[00:17:38.146 --> 00:17:40.167]  Because I know we've got the power to turn this around.
[00:17:41.087 --> 00:17:42.428]  We've got to create a culture.
[00:17:43.743 --> 00:17:48.725]  What you'd call, what they call a fad of loving freedom, being informed, being involved.
[00:17:48.925 --> 00:17:52.025]  We need to start hanging out together, going to dinner together.
[00:17:52.045 --> 00:17:55.527]  You know, going, Patriots going on vacation together.
[00:17:57.167 --> 00:17:59.188]  Just going to the same clubs.
[00:17:59.948 --> 00:18:00.408]  Everything!
[00:18:00.448 --> 00:18:01.688]  Going to the same gyms.
[00:18:02.529 --> 00:18:04.669]  I tell you, that's what's going to turn this around.
[00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.471]  Is we, we are the biggest
[00:18:11.357 --> 00:18:14.038]  Most powerful, real subculture in America.
[00:18:15.058 --> 00:18:17.699]  The government's always creating new fake subcultures to control people.
[00:18:18.059 --> 00:18:20.660]  And we've got to grow our subculture into the dominant culture.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:26.742]  We've got to overthrow, in a counter-revolutionary fashion, the false culture they've brought in and taken over with.
[00:18:28.823 --> 00:18:31.084]  I've really been thinking about how to win this.
[00:18:32.004 --> 00:18:34.125]  We've got to make it fun to be a freedom fighter.
[00:18:36.266 --> 00:18:37.246]  Because it is fun.
[00:18:38.747 --> 00:18:39.627]  And it's exciting.
[00:18:40.794 --> 00:18:44.217]  And it's cutting edge, and it's dynamic, and it's real.
[00:18:49.241 --> 00:18:49.802]  Oh boy.
[00:18:54.646 --> 00:18:55.206]  Listen to this.
[00:18:55.226 --> 00:18:56.527]  This is the New York Times.
[00:18:57.088 --> 00:19:00.691]  Reports that led to terror alert were years old, officials say.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:12.171]  Much of the information that led to authorities to raise the terror alert at several large financial institutions, it's been the same in every case, in the New York City and Washington areas, are three or four years old!
[00:19:13.733 --> 00:19:23.204]  Intelligence and law enforcement officials said on Monday they reported that they had not yet found concrete evidence that a terrorist plot or a preparatory surveillance operation were still underway.
[00:19:23.732 --> 00:19:32.299]  Of course, they had to admit yesterday that the so-called white supremacist threat to the media vehicles at the Boston situation last week were fake.
[00:19:32.459 --> 00:19:33.440]  That was not true!
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.065]  Folks, we have a giant section on Prison Planet of fake terror alerts, where they admittedly issue fake terror alerts.
[00:19:41.786 --> 00:19:43.187]  That's a federal crime, by the way.
[00:19:43.707 --> 00:19:44.728]  To issue fake alerts.
[00:19:45.329 --> 00:19:46.930]  But they're the criminals, so they're allowed to do it.
[00:19:47.971 --> 00:19:48.851]  So, there you have it.
[00:19:48.891 --> 00:19:50.653]  Here's another one out of the Associated Press.
[00:19:52.185 --> 00:19:54.570]  We'll come back, get into all of it, take your calls, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.611]  Infowars.com is the website.
[00:20:03.306 --> 00:20:07.787]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:08.127 --> 00:20:12.229]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:12.509 --> 00:20:13.069]  We listened.
[00:20:13.389 --> 00:20:18.370]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:18.631 --> 00:20:19.131]  We listened.
[00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:22.552]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:23.492]  We listened.
[00:20:23.952 --> 00:20:28.035]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:28.896]  We listened.
[00:20:29.236 --> 00:20:34.479]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.261]  Again, we listened.
[00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:44.006]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:20:44.386 --> 00:20:47.849]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[00:20:53.862 --> 00:20:54.843]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:20:54.863 --> 00:20:56.424]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.570]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:07.431]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.591 --> 00:21:15.393]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.653 --> 00:21:21.034]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:21.234 --> 00:21:28.216]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:28.516 --> 00:21:33.838]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:38.841]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:39.181 --> 00:21:46.804]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:47.124 --> 00:21:52.627]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:56.169]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.609 --> 00:21:58.110]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:03.754]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.434 --> 00:22:11.079]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.541]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:22:15.342 --> 00:22:21.546]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:22:22.478 --> 00:22:30.580]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:39.442]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:40.303 --> 00:22:41.843]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:41.863 --> 00:22:42.223]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:49.923 --> 00:22:49.963]  516-8736.
[00:22:50.083 --> 00:22:50.744]  Call now.
[00:22:50.804 --> 00:22:54.809]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:00.757 --> 00:23:03.119]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.224]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:23:07.544 --> 00:23:08.345]  Read the labels.
[00:23:08.785 --> 00:23:12.889]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:13.129 --> 00:23:17.314]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:23:17.694 --> 00:23:22.579]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:23:22.939 --> 00:23:26.541]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:23:26.721 --> 00:23:32.064]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:23:32.324 --> 00:23:35.065]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:23:35.366 --> 00:23:36.246]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:36.566 --> 00:23:47.292]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[00:23:47.652 --> 00:23:49.092]  Call Cal Ben toll free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:23:49.112 --> 00:23:50.253]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit CalBenPureSoap.com.
[00:23:50.293 --> 00:23:52.113]  You know, I can't help but have a chill run up my spine.
[00:24:17.825 --> 00:24:20.207]  To have the hair on the back of my neck stand up.
[00:24:20.907 --> 00:24:24.229]  When I think about the fact that we're inside the New World Order now.
[00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.551]  The tyranny is upon us.
[00:24:27.651 --> 00:24:28.832]  It's intensifying.
[00:24:29.412 --> 00:24:31.053]  Growing by leaps and bounds.
[00:24:31.073 --> 00:24:32.734]  Waxing greater and greater.
[00:24:34.095 --> 00:24:35.656]  And people can deny it all day.
[00:24:35.716 --> 00:24:39.378]  They can, out of subconscious fear, decide to try to join it.
[00:24:41.299 --> 00:24:44.021]  This system will feed on you regardless of what you do.
[00:24:44.801 --> 00:24:46.122]  You've got to stand against it.
[00:24:46.182 --> 00:24:47.824]  You've got to fight it, my friends.
[00:24:49.506 --> 00:24:53.609]  Eric and Clayton and Margaret and Tim and everybody else, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:53.629 --> 00:24:57.093]  Let me try to focus in on the news, my friends.
[00:24:57.113 --> 00:25:02.478]  I've already mentioned a lot of it, but again, reports that led to terror alert were years old, officials say.
[00:25:02.658 --> 00:25:03.799]  Three and four years old.
[00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:09.046]  And then I remember that they go, oh, it was a mistake.
[00:25:09.206 --> 00:25:10.987]  Oh, it was an intelligence failure.
[00:25:11.167 --> 00:25:13.028]  Oh, it was not good information.
[00:25:13.168 --> 00:25:14.028]  Oh, it wasn't true.
[00:25:14.188 --> 00:25:15.069]  Oh, it wasn't real.
[00:25:16.469 --> 00:25:19.190]  Oh, we planted those fake letters from troops in the newspapers.
[00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.951]  Oh, we falsified the Niger document.
[00:25:22.092 --> 00:25:25.473]  Oh, we lied about the chemical weapons lab in Northern Iraq.
[00:25:25.493 --> 00:25:26.253]  It was a bakery.
[00:25:26.793 --> 00:25:31.215]  Oh, we accidentally planted those sarin bombs, but don't worry about it.
[00:25:31.615 --> 00:25:33.116]  We'll just say that in the back of the paper.
[00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:46.586]  And so, um, but the officials, the authorities say, but even though this is four years old and three years old, still, it's a very, very serious threat.
[00:25:47.907 --> 00:26:01.197]  Meanwhile, there's all these disgusting articles about, oh, financial workers, they're defiant, they're so brave, and they show men in black ski masks, black helmets, pointing machine guns at people.
[00:26:01.857 --> 00:26:05.300]  We posted some photos on InfoWorks today that
[00:26:06.132 --> 00:26:08.153]  Should be Pulitzer Prize winning photographs.
[00:26:08.413 --> 00:26:10.554]  If anybody had a Pulitzer Prize for that type of journalism.
[00:26:12.335 --> 00:26:22.499]  I mean, it's just a giant black officer that looks so evil with this face mask looking with just abject hatred.
[00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:23.979]  He should be a Hollywood actor.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:32.343]  Looking down at these people and then there's this big white cop who looks even more evil shaking people down.
[00:26:32.683 --> 00:26:34.584]  You've just got to go look at these photos.
[00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:41.914]  They're bugging their eyes out, holding their batons, grimacing at the public, us against them, and it was all fake!
[00:26:41.954 --> 00:26:43.055]  It's all staged!
[00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:45.697]  Why are they gearing up for this?
[00:26:45.717 --> 00:26:54.582]  Because they're going to take your pension funds, they're going to take everything you've got, we're going to turn into a third world country, it's the admitted government plan, it's public, public, public, public, public!
[00:26:54.862 --> 00:26:55.683]  You weren't public!
[00:26:56.604 --> 00:27:00.246]  And when you riot and complain and scream, they're going to blow your head off, folks!
[00:27:01.222 --> 00:27:11.068]  All of this rubber bullet stuff is just a training aid, training the German Shepherd Attack Dogs, that's what these people are, how to attack.
[00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:15.131]  And training you to see the image of them attacking.
[00:27:16.652 --> 00:27:23.756]  And I'm not against the police, but I'm against them being turned into Ring Wraiths, being turned into Gestapo,
[00:27:26.593 --> 00:27:29.415]  So financial workers defiant despite threat.
[00:27:29.976 --> 00:27:31.437]  I love this article from today.
[00:27:32.278 --> 00:27:50.734]  Despite the fact that they admit this is all fake, there's still financial institutions identified as targets of a terrorist plot in three cities open for business under stepped up security and defiant words from people who said they won't be cowed by the extraordinary intelligence pointing to a potential attack.
[00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:52.055]  It's extraordinary!
[00:27:53.562 --> 00:27:55.584]  It's stuff I heard three, four years ago!
[00:27:56.104 --> 00:27:59.627]  Al-Qaeda left a manual saying they might attack this, they might attack that!
[00:27:59.947 --> 00:28:01.508]  It's, it's fresh, it's new!
[00:28:01.728 --> 00:28:03.190]  They've got truck bombs in D.C.
[00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.911]  right now, they're about to kill everyone!
[00:28:05.211 --> 00:28:06.552]  Oh, it's four years old, sorry.
[00:28:06.572 --> 00:28:11.596]  Oh my goodness.
[00:28:12.317 --> 00:28:20.323]  So... Meanwhile... Meanwhile... Bush calls for intelligence, czar.
[00:28:20.383 --> 00:28:21.044]  This is from CNN.
[00:28:22.529 --> 00:28:26.771]  President embraces key suggestion of 9-11 Commission.
[00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.672]  And again, the Commission said at the beginning, remember?
[00:28:29.692 --> 00:28:32.653]  They said we want a domestic CIA and a Patriot Act, too.
[00:28:32.693 --> 00:28:33.693]  They said that over a year ago.
[00:28:34.794 --> 00:28:38.235]  And now, wow, Kerry and Bush agree, everyone agrees.
[00:28:38.635 --> 00:28:40.656]  Oh, the Commission, independent, huh?
[00:28:42.003 --> 00:28:48.950]  Like Bush's Independent Elections Commission that says they might want to suspend things, appointed by Bush, who put in electronic machines.
[00:28:49.511 --> 00:28:58.460]  President Bush said Monday that he is asking Congress to create the position of a National Intelligence Director to serve as his principal advisor on countering terrorism.
[00:28:59.622 --> 00:29:03.526]  It'll be over all 15 federal security and anti-terror agencies.
[00:29:08.018 --> 00:29:11.822]  And it will not report to Congress, and Bush doesn't even want to report to the President!
[00:29:12.342 --> 00:29:14.764]  It's gonna be a new branch of government!
[00:29:15.425 --> 00:29:15.765]  Yes!
[00:29:16.346 --> 00:29:18.628]  It'll be totally independent of everything!
[00:29:18.948 --> 00:29:19.949]  That's wonderful!
[00:29:19.989 --> 00:29:22.151]  The shadow government publicly to take over!
[00:29:24.353 --> 00:29:26.295]  What is already is now emerging.
[00:29:26.575 --> 00:29:29.197]  What was already in place decades ago, now go in public!
[00:29:29.638 --> 00:29:30.098]  And why?
[00:29:30.138 --> 00:29:34.302]  Because now they're ready to roll this puppy out and use it!
[00:29:35.863 --> 00:29:44.851]  I was sent some photos from an Alabama football game where they had citizen volunteers in military uniform searching everyone.
[00:29:45.592 --> 00:29:47.013]  Oh yes, we'll talk about that too.
[00:29:47.413 --> 00:29:48.354]  And your calls first.
[00:29:48.374 --> 00:29:50.556]  When we get back, oh please, stay with me.
[00:29:52.318 --> 00:29:53.239]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.699 --> 00:29:55.301]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.221 --> 00:29:58.904]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.105 --> 00:30:07.226]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:09.647]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:10.167 --> 00:30:14.768]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[00:30:15.088 --> 00:30:16.468]  It actually works.
[00:30:16.868 --> 00:30:20.249]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:30:20.329 --> 00:30:21.850]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:24.210]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenated.
[00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.951]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[00:30:28.644 --> 00:30:29.285]  It truly works.
[00:30:29.665 --> 00:30:30.846]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:30:59.084 --> 00:30:59.504]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:30:59.644 --> 00:31:06.987]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[00:31:07.187 --> 00:31:11.648]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[00:31:11.808 --> 00:31:25.833]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:26.073 --> 00:31:45.264]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[00:31:45.485 --> 00:31:49.107]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[00:31:49.247 --> 00:31:50.488]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[00:31:50.668 --> 00:31:51.928]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:58.511]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:59.091 --> 00:32:00.951]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:02.372 --> 00:32:03.392]  It's finally here!
[00:32:03.492 --> 00:32:04.512]  Spring has arrived!
[00:32:04.672 --> 00:32:07.633]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:32:07.853 --> 00:32:11.334]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:32:11.534 --> 00:32:19.676]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:32:19.936 --> 00:32:20.776]  With Ark's heirloom
[00:32:20.776 --> 00:32:21.116]  I think?
[00:32:41.049 --> 00:32:41.389]  Thank you.
[00:33:25.964 --> 00:33:29.207]  I know what's right.
[00:33:29.247 --> 00:33:33.590]  I got just one life, folks, and so do you.
[00:33:34.131 --> 00:33:34.651]  Welcome back.
[00:33:34.691 --> 00:33:38.415]  Thank you for joining us on this Tuesday, the third day of August 2004 edition.
[00:33:38.475 --> 00:33:43.899]  We're going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.985]  Just continuing, Bush calls for Intelligence Czar, a new super agency over
[00:33:51.110 --> 00:34:19.024]  all of the intelligence and security agencies outside the presidency outside congress with its own funding overseeing the country now if that's not pure one hundred percent massive textbook dictatorship I don't know what is and all of this with a backdrop
[00:34:21.904 --> 00:34:27.725]  of financial scams of fraud on a huge scale taking place.
[00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:46.970]  You know I said yesterday morning that look for massive financial manipulation because they said oh we've got financial institutions that are targets and again it turns out that's three four-year-old news from some pamphlet they got from an Al-Qaeda encampment.
[00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:58.472]  And I said, look for the stock market to go down, but in key areas, look for government officials and people to have put in put options or bets against stock.
[00:35:00.253 --> 00:35:02.933]  Look for oil to explode even further.
[00:35:02.953 --> 00:35:07.294]  And that is exactly what happened.
[00:35:07.414 --> 00:35:10.835]  And of course, I didn't mention this, but I should have foreseen this.
[00:35:11.495 --> 00:35:15.716]  You know, the dollar's down over 40 cents to what it was just three years ago.
[00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:20.292]  And now it's plunged even further.
[00:35:21.532 --> 00:35:23.392]  But let's cover this first.
[00:35:24.193 --> 00:35:29.914]  Crude oil futures flirt with $44 a barrel.
[00:35:30.274 --> 00:35:45.458]  Crude oil futures in New York settled minutely higher Monday, but hit a fresh all-time high just cents away from $44 a barrel as more negative developments from Russia's biggest oil producer erased market weakness on the new U.S.
[00:35:45.498 --> 00:35:46.418]  tariff warnings.
[00:35:47.566 --> 00:35:56.035]  Russian tax authorities dealt oil giant Owo Yukos another blow, saying they plan to conduct a further probe of its business activities.
[00:35:56.796 --> 00:36:01.440]  And they've said they're going to cut production, maybe even shut it off for a month or so.
[00:36:02.261 --> 00:36:03.903]  Meanwhile, dollar weakens.
[00:36:04.103 --> 00:36:07.386]  Al-Qaeda threatens New York Stock Exchange.
[00:36:07.406 --> 00:36:09.649]  This is out of Bloomberg Financial.
[00:36:10.911 --> 00:36:16.893]  The dollar fell in Europe against the Euro for the first day in a week and dropped versus the Swiss franc after the U.S.
[00:36:16.933 --> 00:36:25.517]  said Al-Qaeda, admittedly a CIA organization, just publicly CIA folks, may attack the New York Stock Exchange and the International Monetary Fund.
[00:36:25.877 --> 00:36:36.121]  Homeland Security Department Secretary Tom Blockhead Ridge raised the alert level for financial institutions in New York, northern New Jersey, and Washington.
[00:36:36.141 --> 00:36:38.102]  The threats may cause some investors to
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.561]  Reciprocate funds from the U.S.
[00:36:42.681 --> 00:36:43.742]  weakening the dollar.
[00:36:45.363 --> 00:36:51.086]  Said Mutual Kanachi, Head of Currency Strategy at Kalon in London.
[00:36:51.546 --> 00:36:53.327]  It's a very specific threat to the U.S.
[00:36:53.387 --> 00:36:54.368]  financial institutions.
[00:36:54.748 --> 00:37:04.013]  It seems stronger than usual, said Katachi at Kalon, the investment banking unit of Credit Arcola S.A.
[00:37:04.074 --> 00:37:06.575]  The terror alert will result in pressure on the dollar.
[00:37:08.052 --> 00:37:14.976]  And the dollar fell even more to $1.2698 to the Swiss franc.
[00:37:17.717 --> 00:37:20.919]  Oh, and plunged against the pound and the euro.
[00:37:21.299 --> 00:37:25.301]  So, that's happening there right now.
[00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:30.604]  Just amazing to see this happening and to see people buying into this.
[00:37:31.864 --> 00:37:37.107]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to calls and I'll get to all the other news, but in case you missed it,
[00:37:37.972 --> 00:37:39.874]  This is another fake terror alert.
[00:37:41.695 --> 00:37:44.858]  It's three and four years old, and I remembered this when I heard it.
[00:37:45.118 --> 00:38:01.051]  Wait a minute, they found some manual in some raid in Germany three years ago, and I'd forgotten about the one four years ago, and then they found something in Afghanistan two years ago about, oh, we could attack things like the Federal Reserve.
[00:38:02.972 --> 00:38:04.834]  And so it's a real credible threat.
[00:38:04.874 --> 00:38:06.555]  The Muslims are there right now with truck bombs.
[00:38:06.575 --> 00:38:07.536]  They're going to get us any minute!
[00:38:08.246 --> 00:38:10.448]  Just like they did at the First World Trade Center, Rich said.
[00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:12.550]  First World Trade Center, Rich.
[00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.231]  The FBI cooked the bomb and drained the driver.
[00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:14.752]  It's admitted!
[00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:16.714]  You people make me sick!
[00:38:17.174 --> 00:38:19.656]  Stop raping my country, you pieces of filth!
[00:38:19.676 --> 00:38:27.243]  Of course, Bush said last year a plunging dollar's good.
[00:38:27.263 --> 00:38:27.704]  Remember that?
[00:38:27.724 --> 00:38:28.544]  That's very good.
[00:38:28.564 --> 00:38:30.726]  And then exporting jobs is our greatest export.
[00:38:30.746 --> 00:38:31.267]  It's very good.
[00:38:32.853 --> 00:38:41.659]  That'll get seven times worse, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and if you don't worry, your new service job, your hamburger job, will be considered high-tech in the statistics.
[00:38:42.699 --> 00:38:47.543]  Eric in Tennessee, then Eric in Connecticut, and Clayton, and Margaret, and Tim, and everybody else.
[00:38:47.783 --> 00:38:48.523]  Eric, go ahead.
[00:38:48.983 --> 00:38:49.844]  How you doing today, Alec?
[00:38:50.044 --> 00:38:50.284]  Good.
[00:38:50.825 --> 00:38:58.710]  I was the one that called yesterday that had the one video clip where Bush was talking about how Congress was to blame, and
[00:38:59.554 --> 00:39:19.308]  I got part of the clip cued up and then I found the other part of it, but what I was wanting to tell you about today, I don't know if you want me to play that today, but today on CNN, they showed a map of Washington, D.C., and based on those four-year-old bombing threats, the Al-Qaeda is going to get us, you know, the obvious.
[00:39:19.328 --> 00:39:22.070]  They're going to lock down more roads, more streets.
[00:39:23.087 --> 00:39:26.930]  More barricades, the government bunkering in against us, the slaves.
[00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:32.034]  Yep, they showed a map of the checkpoints that they're going to put up in Washington D.C.
[00:39:32.234 --> 00:39:33.215]  up until the election.
[00:39:33.235 --> 00:39:35.357]  They're going to be constant checkpoints now.
[00:39:35.737 --> 00:39:48.167]  And again, these are advertisements, but meanwhile, from Kansas to Florida to Texas to California, it's a seatbelt check or a driver's license check, and they pull all the cars over, search the vehicles,
[00:39:48.747 --> 00:40:05.461]  At least they admit it's not for terrorism, but it's this backdrop, this atmosphere, and now at college football games, and they're even showing up, folks, at ice skating rinks and malls, troops, going, let me see your driver's license, as if it does anything.
[00:40:05.761 --> 00:40:08.604]  It's all about training us to live under martial law.
[00:40:08.624 --> 00:40:09.384]  It's really happening.
[00:40:09.785 --> 00:40:10.205]  That's right.
[00:40:10.245 --> 00:40:11.666]  The squeeze is on, Alex.
[00:40:12.087 --> 00:40:13.328]  I was wanting to tell you something.
[00:40:14.609 --> 00:40:15.890]  I've got a video clip from 1997.
[00:40:18.944 --> 00:40:36.819]  Justice Department Oversight Committee hearing where there was an exchange between Senator Charles Grassley and Janet Reno concerning how a Colonel Ellis, a Special Forces Colonel Ellis, was put in second command of the FBI National Counterterrorism Task Force.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:44.826]  In that exchange, Senator Grassley said emphatically, not like maybe this happened, he said
[00:40:47.178 --> 00:41:00.023]  He told General Reno, when you got the military involved in Waco and at Ruby Ridge, it violated those Americans' civil liberties and the Constitution, and it violated posse comitatus.
[00:41:01.544 --> 00:41:14.669]  And also, he quoted a memo from the Undersecretary of the Army that Attorney General Reno and Assistant Attorney General Grolich, that was on the 9-11 Commission,
[00:41:15.931 --> 00:41:29.977]  A memo stating, and also Louis Freeh, the FBI Director at the time, asked for, and persisted in getting, this Colonel Ellis, a active duty, full-bird colonel, into the FBI Counter-Terrorism Force at that time.
[00:41:30.657 --> 00:41:34.739]  Well, Eric, do me a favor, will you mail me that C-SPAN clip?
[00:41:35.279 --> 00:41:35.999]  Yeah, I sure will.
[00:41:36.159 --> 00:41:36.940]  Promise me you will.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:37.960]  I sure will, sir.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.621]  And will you mark it clearly?
[00:41:39.641 --> 00:41:44.843]  I remember when that happened, we got the Delta Force memos, where they were ordered to go in and kill him,
[00:41:45.723 --> 00:41:52.449]  And then there's this debate, if it really happened, when we have the FLIR footage of him doing it, and they said, oh no, that's not machine guns going off.
[00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:53.530]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:41:54.551 --> 00:41:57.653]  But, good points, Eric.
[00:41:57.693 --> 00:41:58.494]  I appreciate the call.
[00:41:58.534 --> 00:42:04.599]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.481]  Eric in Connecticut.
[00:42:06.521 --> 00:42:07.061]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:09.383]  Greetings, Alex, from devil-worshipping country.
[00:42:10.364 --> 00:42:12.546]  Christian, conservative, skull-and-bones country.
[00:42:12.806 --> 00:42:13.486]  Oh, I forgot.
[00:42:13.567 --> 00:42:13.767]  Yes.
[00:42:14.435 --> 00:42:15.155]  Um, D.J.
[00:42:15.195 --> 00:42:21.579]  O'Rourke had a great saying, giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys.
[00:42:22.499 --> 00:42:23.159]  That's a good one.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.300]  I thought so.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:38.207]  You know, with all the news about policemen and paramilitarism, these cops wearing their little ninja outfits banging down doors without warrants, there's an excellent briefing paper
[00:42:39.198 --> 00:42:47.925]  That's put out by the Cato Institute, and it's a briefing paper 50, and the title of it is, The Alarming Rise of Paramilitarism in American Police Department.
[00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:56.672]  And I will have that briefing paper tonight at the public hearing regarding the National Guard in town getting in together.
[00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:01.371]  Now, you did send me that mainstream news article, the link went dead.
[00:43:01.711 --> 00:43:03.331]  You sent me a PDF file.
[00:43:03.851 --> 00:43:06.852]  Will you send that to tipsandinfowars.com again?
[00:43:06.872 --> 00:43:07.552]  I want to post that.
[00:43:07.572 --> 00:43:11.513]  But for those that just joined us, explain what's happening in your town.
[00:43:11.553 --> 00:43:12.033]  Tell folks.
[00:43:12.293 --> 00:43:12.633]  Okay.
[00:43:13.333 --> 00:43:14.494]  Well, Alex, this is the deal.
[00:43:14.834 --> 00:43:21.095]  What the town wants to do is they want to form a partnership with the National Guard.
[00:43:21.655 --> 00:43:26.416]  National Guard is getting a state grant to build a military police unit.
[00:43:27.094 --> 00:43:27.834]  In my town.
[00:43:27.954 --> 00:43:42.757]  Well, the first elect of my town, Wayne Frazier, he wants to form a partnership, basically cross-training, sharing facilities, sharing cells, basically going into a complete partnership with the National Guard.
[00:43:43.217 --> 00:43:45.338]  And you sent me the article and I have it.
[00:43:45.798 --> 00:43:48.839]  And folks, this is happening nationwide, quietly.
[00:43:48.899 --> 00:43:50.499]  That's why you go to the football game
[00:43:51.414 --> 00:43:53.696]  And there's troops there searching your bags.
[00:43:53.796 --> 00:44:04.226]  It's all... Look, they had troops, it's in my film Road to Tyranny, in 1988-89, raiding gun dealers' homes.
[00:44:04.346 --> 00:44:09.711]  I mean, this has been going on forever, illegally, quietly, creating the Cadres, and now it's going public.
[00:44:09.951 --> 00:44:14.115]  Well, Alex, there's a lot of opposition rising across the town to this plan.
[00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:18.674]  And there are people who are saying, and I agree, that it is out and out illegal.
[00:44:18.694 --> 00:44:20.355]  Let me tell you what happened in Austin.
[00:44:20.375 --> 00:44:21.896]  Again, my cousin is involved in this.
[00:44:22.976 --> 00:44:24.937]  18 years overseas at Fort Bragg.
[00:44:25.598 --> 00:44:31.381]  Now for a year and a half, he's been at Bergstrom, former military base, Air Force base, now our airport.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:38.482]  And that's what they also want to do, and I'm going to mention this tonight, and I don't think a lot of people know about this, Dallas.
[00:44:38.502 --> 00:44:40.563]  They want to put surveillance cameras basically all over town.
[00:44:53.268 --> 00:45:04.896]  Yeah, the military comes into your town, puts up cameras, troops patrol, has nothing to do with terror, they're gonna search your car, they're gonna run your life, they're gonna round you up when it comes time to put you on buses, and ship you to a FEMA camp!
[00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:13.421]  Now folks, I told you there'd be troops on the streets 8-9 years ago, you laughed at me, I said they'd use terror to do it, and now it's happening, and you can watch it happen or you can fight it!
[00:45:13.701 --> 00:45:20.466]  Well we're gonna fight it tonight Alex, and I'm gonna be getting news out about your website, about your videos, and also this report
[00:45:21.215 --> 00:45:28.557]  Um, by the Cato Institute Briefing Paper 50, and goes into all the... I'll tell you what, email that to me too, and I'll post both of them, okay?
[00:45:28.877 --> 00:45:31.417]  Okay, I'll just hold... And listen, do you have a video camera?
[00:45:31.457 --> 00:45:32.378]  You ought to videotape this.
[00:45:32.618 --> 00:45:33.938]  If I get a chance, I will.
[00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:40.619]  Okay, because I work nights, and it's going to be something for me to get there, but if I can bring my video camera, I will tape it.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.300]  Yeah, just set up a tripod.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:42.940]  Yep.
[00:45:44.417 --> 00:45:46.498]  This whole thing stinks, Alex, and I'll tell you something.
[00:45:46.558 --> 00:45:47.658]  I don't like it one bit.
[00:45:48.038 --> 00:45:51.780]  Well, are people figuring out that this is like Red Dawn or something?
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.661]  I think a lot of people are getting wise.
[00:45:54.221 --> 00:45:54.461]  Good.
[00:45:54.501 --> 00:45:55.101]  Good to hear from you.
[00:45:55.121 --> 00:45:55.581]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:45:55.862 --> 00:45:56.642]  Take care, my friend.
[00:45:56.662 --> 00:46:00.063]  Yeah, he sent me that article, and it was up for a day, and the link went dead.
[00:46:00.103 --> 00:46:05.665]  It went to subscription on that local newspaper website, but he did send me the PDF file.
[00:46:05.685 --> 00:46:07.626]  I never posted it, but now I can't find it.
[00:46:08.106 --> 00:46:08.967]  Send it again, brother.
[00:46:08.987 --> 00:46:09.627]  I'll post it.
[00:46:11.213 --> 00:46:12.753]  Uh, let's talk to Margaret.
[00:46:12.914 --> 00:46:13.894]  No, no, no.
[00:46:13.914 --> 00:46:14.654]  Clayton's up next.
[00:46:14.714 --> 00:46:16.034]  Clayton in Missouri, then Margaret.
[00:46:16.054 --> 00:46:16.595]  Go ahead, Clayton.
[00:46:19.255 --> 00:46:19.895]  Uh, yes, Clayton.
[00:46:20.416 --> 00:46:21.376]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:46:22.176 --> 00:46:23.356]  Alright, Clayton's not there.
[00:46:24.157 --> 00:46:25.157]  Margaret in Illinois.
[00:46:25.217 --> 00:46:26.057]  Margaret, go ahead.
[00:46:26.777 --> 00:46:27.077]  Hello.
[00:46:27.297 --> 00:46:27.918]  Hello, Alex.
[00:46:27.978 --> 00:46:28.418]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:46:28.438 --> 00:46:30.418]  Uh, it's good to hear your voice.
[00:46:30.778 --> 00:46:31.919]  Uh, I have bad news.
[00:46:31.939 --> 00:46:36.020]  They took your program off our WINI radio station.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:40.261]  And they also put on a man named Tom Hartman.
[00:46:41.092 --> 00:46:41.972]  Are you familiar with him?
[00:46:41.992 --> 00:46:58.060]  Well, you know, W-I-N-I, I've been off and on that station for like four years, and they'll have me on during the day, have me on at night, take me on, put me off, and they're a great station, and so what do they put on and play something each time?
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.381]  Well, you'll have to hear a tape to believe it.
[00:47:00.922 --> 00:47:07.405]  This man is promoting the New World Order religion, the Maitreya.
[00:47:08.145 --> 00:47:09.846]  He plays an ad
[00:47:11.118 --> 00:47:30.885]  Every, uh, at 10 till 11, 10 till 12, uh, and it's this woman in a sweet soft voice, and she says, we must share the wealth of the world to bring peace through the enlightened teachers, led by the world teacher, Maitreya.
[00:47:31.526 --> 00:47:32.366]  Are you familiar with it?
[00:47:32.386 --> 00:47:34.567]  Yeah, this is some Benjamin Crimm follower?
[00:47:34.847 --> 00:47:37.328]  Yes, and this man is involved with him.
[00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:39.849]  And that's what they replaced my show with?
[00:47:41.957 --> 00:47:42.597]  That's funny.
[00:47:42.878 --> 00:47:43.778]  That's really scary.
[00:47:43.918 --> 00:47:44.999]  Yeah, it is scary.
[00:47:45.079 --> 00:47:55.225]  I have the tape, and also, they offer a free tape concerning this, about his lectures, and it's free, and I have ordered it.
[00:47:55.325 --> 00:47:57.146]  I wouldn't spend money, that's for sure.
[00:47:58.207 --> 00:48:01.609]  But I've ordered it, and I wondered if you would like a copy of this ad.
[00:48:04.518 --> 00:48:05.339]  I'm fully aware.
[00:48:05.499 --> 00:48:06.799]  Let me do it in a nutshell.
[00:48:06.859 --> 00:48:08.960]  The world leader will soon be upon us.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.420]  The world government loves you.
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.681]  As soon as you submit to our new leader, peace will come.
[00:48:13.921 --> 00:48:15.222]  Global, global, global.
[00:48:16.862 --> 00:48:26.685]  Yes, but I was wondering, you know, the ACLU, if it were a Christian organization promoting the real teacher, Jesus Christ, the ACLU would stop it.
[00:48:27.225 --> 00:48:32.707]  But here he is promoting a religion and he will get by with it.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.884]  Well, you know, why don't we just, uh, just call, have you called WII?
[00:48:37.904 --> 00:48:39.145]  Of course I sure have!
[00:48:40.025 --> 00:48:40.905]  And what did they say?
[00:48:42.006 --> 00:48:51.030]  Uh, I even called Tom Hartman and he, uh, I'll, uh, I'll put you on hold and I will, uh, let you talk to the people who do our advertising.
[00:48:51.531 --> 00:48:52.551]  And nothing happened.
[00:48:53.652 --> 00:48:55.253]  Oh, this is a local talk show host?
[00:48:56.053 --> 00:48:57.814]  Uh, no, he, uh, he's not local.
[00:48:58.174 --> 00:48:59.955]  He's, he's put on sort of like you.
[00:48:59.995 --> 00:49:00.735]  I don't know where he came from.
[00:49:00.755 --> 00:49:01.876]  He comes from the liberal left.
[00:49:03.846 --> 00:49:04.867]  Well, pretty interesting.
[00:49:04.887 --> 00:49:06.788]  Well, folks, you just call that station.
[00:49:06.808 --> 00:49:07.868]  You got their phone number on you?
[00:49:08.508 --> 00:49:09.529]  Oh, sorry, I don't.
[00:49:10.449 --> 00:49:13.011]  Well, you know, they take us off, put us on.
[00:49:13.051 --> 00:49:14.711]  I'm not going to get too angry.
[00:49:14.731 --> 00:49:16.512]  Well, I've asked them to put you back on.
[00:49:16.572 --> 00:49:17.933]  I call them every once in a while.
[00:49:19.093 --> 00:49:19.454]  All right.
[00:49:19.494 --> 00:49:20.374]  Well, thanks for the call.
[00:49:20.394 --> 00:49:22.395]  I appreciate it.
[00:49:22.855 --> 00:49:23.696]  I don't mean to laugh.
[00:49:23.776 --> 00:49:26.657]  It's just... Muhammad in Colorado.
[00:49:26.677 --> 00:49:27.718]  Muhammad, you're on the air.
[00:49:27.778 --> 00:49:28.198]  Go ahead.
[00:49:28.998 --> 00:49:29.699]  Alex, how are you?
[00:49:29.959 --> 00:49:30.299]  Good, sir.
[00:49:32.961 --> 00:49:45.665]  You know, I'm a camera guy here in Denver and I affect about 50 people to infowards.com and when I picked them up next time, when I texted, they were just amazed and awed about the information.
[00:49:45.745 --> 00:49:58.248]  I picked up this one very orthodox Jewish businessman and he was just, he complimented to tell you that how accurate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was in the history.
[00:49:58.328 --> 00:49:59.349]  He really complimented.
[00:49:59.389 --> 00:50:00.929]  He was amazed at how accurate it was.
[00:50:01.363 --> 00:50:05.884]  I said, of course, Alex would not put something there that's not, uh, he investigates and everything.
[00:50:06.184 --> 00:50:12.766]  I mainly called to tell, uh, listeners to, if they can pick up a Reader's Digest July, uh, issue.
[00:50:13.287 --> 00:50:27.711]  It talks about, uh, how black boxes and GPS, uh, um, GPS devices, uh, they, the title, uh, the article, uh, title is The Scary New Threat to Your Privacy, about the cars and stuff like that.
[00:50:27.771 --> 00:50:30.412]  It's the July issue of, uh, Reader's Digest.
[00:50:30.432 --> 00:50:31.012]  It's pretty good.
[00:50:31.536 --> 00:50:38.220]  And I also want to say how Tom Ridge, how Tom Ridge said there might not be any election because of these threats that they're making up.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:38.920]  That's all, guys.
[00:50:38.941 --> 00:50:40.181]  Well, it's streets, Mohammed.
[00:50:40.221 --> 00:50:41.282]  It's all part of the freedom.
[00:50:41.322 --> 00:50:41.682]  Stay there.
[00:50:41.722 --> 00:50:43.403]  We'll let you finish up on the other side.
[00:50:43.423 --> 00:50:46.405]  And we'll get to other calls and a bunch of other news.
[00:50:46.505 --> 00:50:48.166]  And then we got a guest coming up in about an hour.
[00:50:48.186 --> 00:50:48.246]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:49.067 --> 00:50:52.008]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[00:50:52.028 --> 00:50:53.249]  Stay with us.
[00:50:53.269 --> 00:50:53.789]  Stay the course.
[00:51:03.533 --> 00:51:09.456]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:51:09.696 --> 00:51:11.958]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:51:28.727 --> 00:51:29.348]  We're good to go!
[00:52:01.027 --> 00:52:05.372]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:52:05.552 --> 00:52:09.956]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:52:10.117 --> 00:52:14.501]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:52:14.541 --> 00:52:15.903]  The New World Order.
[00:52:16.643 --> 00:52:17.604]  Can emerge.
[00:52:17.665 --> 00:52:21.909]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:52:21.969 --> 00:52:28.897]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:52:29.017 --> 00:52:31.020]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:41.828]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:52:42.028 --> 00:52:47.432]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:52:47.893 --> 00:52:51.816]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:53:00.362 --> 00:53:03.383]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:53:03.703 --> 00:53:08.624]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:53:08.884 --> 00:53:13.245]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:53:13.545 --> 00:53:22.447]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[00:53:22.647 --> 00:53:26.268]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[00:53:26.568 --> 00:53:31.591]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:53:31.892 --> 00:53:38.636]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:53:39.116 --> 00:53:39.657]  What about you?
[00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:45.771]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:28.403]  You know, it's scary to see the police in their federally issued Darth Vader outfits, to see the military being inserted into our daily lives, but those police and military men and women can be reached, can be educated, can be deprogrammed.
[00:54:30.024 --> 00:54:37.531]  When I had a car wreck, got blown off the road by tornadic winds a few weeks ago out in Fredericksburg, Texas, outside Fredericksburg between Johnson City,
[00:54:38.846 --> 00:54:42.009]  The first state police officer to pull up was a fan of the radio show.
[00:54:42.029 --> 00:54:43.110]  We had a discussion about it.
[00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:44.371]  He knew all about the New World Order.
[00:54:45.492 --> 00:54:51.378]  The next one pulled up and I educated him and gave him a copy of some of my videos that were in the vehicle.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.842]  And you know, that's what it takes.
[00:54:55.022 --> 00:55:02.229]  It's just reaching out to them and pointing all of this out and going, use your investigative skills to research what we're telling you, what we're saying.
[00:55:03.982 --> 00:55:06.083]  But they are trying to bring us this tyranny, folks.
[00:55:06.123 --> 00:55:10.604]  That's why we've got to expose who's behind the terror, because that's their pretext for this whole agenda.
[00:55:11.644 --> 00:55:16.705]  Let's go back to Mohammed in Colorado, to John, Elena, Clayton, and Chris, and others.
[00:55:16.885 --> 00:55:18.345]  Go ahead, Mohammed, and finish up.
[00:55:18.966 --> 00:55:19.466]  Hi.
[00:55:19.526 --> 00:55:25.507]  Just a couple of weekends ago, I had about four Special Forces troops in my cab.
[00:55:26.487 --> 00:55:32.849]  They just came from my country, Afghanistan, from Boldak, south of Kandahar, and they were talking
[00:55:33.424 --> 00:55:36.385]  They're like, they're sick and tired of this too, Alex.
[00:55:36.405 --> 00:55:44.409]  They're like, you know, they're like there to a point where there could be some kind of a military coup to get rid of these prostitutes from the White House and everything.
[00:55:44.729 --> 00:55:46.730]  They're like sick, they're like, why are we there?
[00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:50.992]  These kids don't even, some of them don't even know why they're even there, you know?
[00:55:51.012 --> 00:55:52.832]  This is the military speaking, Alex.
[00:55:52.892 --> 00:55:59.475]  I mean, this is just, I mean, it's good news that, to hear stuff like this, but, you know, you don't know how many of them are like that, you know?
[00:55:59.535 --> 00:56:02.957]  It's just, um, I mean, I just want to say to you,
[00:56:03.615 --> 00:56:09.819]  Keep up the good job, and I'm affecting about 50 people a day, and hey man, I'm doing my part.
[00:56:09.939 --> 00:56:13.542]  So, I just want to tell you, God bless you, and great job.
[00:56:13.842 --> 00:56:15.643]  Well, God bless you too, and thanks for the call.
[00:56:16.103 --> 00:56:24.649]  You know, I would add to this that cab drivers, people like that, those are opinion makers, because you have access to the public.
[00:56:25.509 --> 00:56:32.454]  Pastors, VFW hall heads, high school teachers.
[00:56:33.257 --> 00:56:40.099]  College professors, people that own businesses, anybody who engages with the public.
[00:56:41.199 --> 00:56:49.181]  We've all got a responsibility to expose evil, but if you're in a position to reach the public, you've got even more of a responsibility.
[00:56:50.521 --> 00:56:54.602]  They're killing this beautiful, wonderful country, my friends, and we can't put up with it.
[00:56:54.642 --> 00:56:55.582]  We've got to expose that.
[00:56:56.986 --> 00:57:02.953]  We'll break, start the next hour, go back to calls and into the rest of the giant stack of vital news and information.
[00:57:04.716 --> 00:57:11.204]  I'd like to talk to the listeners about the fake terror alerts and the rest of it, the manipulation of oil and the dollar as well.
[00:57:12.293 --> 00:57:29.057]  But if you are one of those opinion makers and you haven't gotten my videos or the other videos and books that I carry at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, you need to visit the website, you need to peruse the Safe Secure shopping cart, you need to order the videos, the books, the books on tape, the t-shirts.
[00:57:29.857 --> 00:57:33.438]  There's so much there that we have to offer and it's all about getting the word out.
[00:57:33.458 --> 00:57:36.839]  It's all about affecting change, educating people.
[00:57:37.439 --> 00:57:40.380]  So I want to challenge you, I want to beseech you to take action.
[00:57:41.047 --> 00:58:02.635]  And to get my 9-11 films, 9-11 The Road to Tyranny, or The Masters of Terror Exposed, to get George Humphrey's 9-11 video I carry, 9-11 The Great Illusion, or Eric Huffschmidt's 9-11 Painful Deceptions, or to get my film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, or one of my Police State videos, you will not be disappointed, and you'll have a powerful tool to educate people.
[00:58:03.015 --> 00:58:04.316]  The ball is in your court.
[00:58:04.356 --> 00:58:05.176]  Please take action.
[00:58:05.856 --> 00:58:09.837]  You want to call and ask about different films or titles or different specials we have right now?
[00:58:10.317 --> 00:58:10.717]  Call toll free.
[00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:10.837]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:10.897 --> 00:58:12.178]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:12.198 --> 00:58:15.539]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:58:33.675 --> 00:58:36.356]  My films are $25.95 a piece all over two hours.
[00:58:37.417 --> 00:58:39.298]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[00:58:40.198 --> 00:58:41.699]  That's just one of the discounts we're offering.
[00:58:42.279 --> 00:58:44.560]  So again, 888-253-3139 or prisonplanet.tv or infowares.com to order.
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.641]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:46.661 --> 00:58:47.041]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.680]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.501]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.141 --> 00:59:03.981]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:06.661]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.681 --> 00:59:10.202]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.482 --> 00:59:14.603]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.463 --> 00:59:22.024]  All right, my friends, we are now into hour number two.
[00:59:22.044 --> 00:59:24.525]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:59:24.565 --> 00:59:25.545]  We have the president
[00:59:26.647 --> 00:59:35.392]  From the National Library Association joining us to talk about some of the new draconian federal activities at libraries that I'll bet you money you haven't heard about.
[00:59:38.493 --> 00:59:39.934]  Unbelievable developments.
[00:59:39.954 --> 00:59:43.036]  We're going to have open phones and a bunch of news this hour.
[00:59:44.076 --> 00:59:47.198]  I would hope that some of the callers here would want to comment on
[00:59:48.012 --> 00:59:56.178]  Bush backs new intelligence czar post, and now I found out, reading the tales of it, it'll be outside the presidency, outside Congress, and outside the courts.
[00:59:56.698 --> 00:59:58.960]  With its own direct funding mechanism.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:04.083]  This is bigger than the 1947 National Security Act that gave them total immunity and anonymity.
[01:00:05.605 --> 01:00:09.828]  It will double the CIA and bring it over all the other intelligence bodies.
[01:00:09.888 --> 01:00:11.729]  This is unbelievable.
[01:00:13.257 --> 01:00:25.527]  And now, what we already knew, I thought this yesterday, but I didn't say it on air, I went, I remember threats to the IMF, the World Bank, threats to the Federal Reserve and Stock Exchange by Al-Shi'aida, a year before 9-11.
[01:00:26.769 --> 01:00:36.637]  And yes, three and a half years ago, in Germany, they captured a manual out of some house, some writings, and it turned out to be a staged arrest, by the way, we found the article.
[01:00:37.896 --> 01:00:40.399]  of an Al-Qaeda individual who they then released.
[01:00:40.759 --> 01:00:42.160]  Oh, there's a plan to do all this.
[01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:44.743]  So that was their new credible, brand new threat.
[01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:47.186]  It's like we've got the newest credible threat.
[01:00:47.726 --> 01:00:50.189]  Saddam's got the weapons of mass destruction, total proof.
[01:00:50.209 --> 01:00:51.490]  Here's the British dossier.
[01:00:52.271 --> 01:00:56.475]  And it turns out it was written by a graduate student 13 years ago.
[01:00:56.495 --> 01:00:59.018]  At the time, 12 years ago.
[01:00:59.919 --> 01:01:01.080]  Now 13 and a half years ago.
[01:01:01.957 --> 01:01:13.383]  So, I mean, folks, they get stuff off message boards, chat rooms, they have a Fed go, type something in, or a Fed puts down some white powder in a building, and, ooh, ooh, could be anthrax, Orange Alert, Orange Alert!
[01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:15.784]  You know, this is disgusting, people.
[01:01:16.504 --> 01:01:25.409]  But again, the mainstream news admits, well, it's an old threat, but we're still, it's very credible and very real, and just, troops have got to set up checkpoints in New Jersey, and
[01:01:26.388 --> 01:01:26.789]  D.C.
[01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:34.758]  and New York, and we've got to search all your vehicles, and by the way, we're going to do it nationwide, and the men in the black uniforms are here to help you, and just shut up and accept it.
[01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:45.050]  Meanwhile, the dollar plunged, oil exploded to an all-time record, $44 a barrel, off of this financial terror news, which they're gaining from.
[01:01:46.439 --> 01:01:50.660]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Wisconsin.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.500]  John, welcome.
[01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:52.641]  Hi Alex.
[01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:54.081]  Hello.
[01:01:54.281 --> 01:01:56.322]  First of all, thanks for waking people up.
[01:01:56.942 --> 01:01:57.722]  You don't have to thank me.
[01:01:57.782 --> 01:01:58.382]  I'm doing my duty.
[01:01:58.422 --> 01:01:58.762]  Go ahead.
[01:01:59.202 --> 01:02:01.703]  We listen to your program every single day.
[01:02:02.983 --> 01:02:08.605]  In light of this new information about the intelligence czar... And it's not new.
[01:02:08.805 --> 01:02:12.926]  Again, when the commission formed, they said that would be their recommendation preemptively.
[01:02:13.832 --> 01:02:23.279]  Right, um, well, the thing was, like, when he announced it, he had said that this person is there to serve the pleasure of the President.
[01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:26.981]  He actually said that in his own words when he announced it.
[01:02:27.261 --> 01:02:31.264]  And then I've got the transcript that he added, though, it'll be outside the presidency.
[01:02:31.784 --> 01:02:32.045]  Right.
[01:02:32.565 --> 01:02:38.889]  And, uh... And then he said Congress is bad and has to advocate, uh, all of its authority.
[01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:42.752]  But, uh, anyway, they said that, uh,
[01:02:44.096 --> 01:02:49.400]  You know, I don't know what the globalists are going to pull, but now, 9-11 was sloppy, a lot of people aren't buying into it.
[01:03:03.468 --> 01:03:06.429]  And so, I don't know if they think they can get away with something again.
[01:03:06.929 --> 01:03:16.551]  Right, and that's what that whole elevation of the terror threat was all about, too, was to condition people to be ready to accept this new intelligence czar program.
[01:03:16.951 --> 01:03:19.672]  Yes, to prostrate ourselves and beg for slavery.
[01:03:20.232 --> 01:03:20.492]  Right.
[01:03:21.092 --> 01:03:31.095]  Well, thank you again, and in light of this new school year coming up, we're going to be going down to local high schools and getting people aware of the
[01:03:32.734 --> 01:03:34.315]  Things that are going on in this country.
[01:03:34.856 --> 01:03:36.637]  Well done, Info Warrior!
[01:03:36.657 --> 01:03:38.338]  Yep, thank you.
[01:03:39.219 --> 01:03:39.740]  Thank you.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.462]  You're on the path to victory, my friend.
[01:03:43.523 --> 01:03:47.906]  We'll be right back and we'll take more of your calls and get to more of this vital news and information.
[01:03:48.587 --> 01:03:50.928]  Again, I'm Alexander Emmerich Jones, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:53.698 --> 01:04:00.563]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.863 --> 01:04:02.244]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.424 --> 01:04:04.625]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.645 --> 01:04:06.867]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:07.147 --> 01:04:12.090]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:16.453]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.693 --> 01:04:18.474]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:29.202]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.362 --> 01:04:31.263]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.463 --> 01:04:35.006]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns on the Info
[01:04:35.106 --> 01:04:35.766]  We're good to go.
[01:04:52.916 --> 01:04:56.198]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.238 --> 01:05:00.421]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.682 --> 01:05:03.464]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.664 --> 01:05:06.065]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.246 --> 01:05:14.892]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:15.092 --> 01:05:16.433]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:05:16.633 --> 01:05:20.776]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:21.116 --> 01:05:21.416]  I think so.
[01:05:53.017 --> 01:05:54.038]  It's finally here.
[01:05:54.158 --> 01:05:55.158]  Spring has arrived.
[01:05:55.338 --> 01:05:58.300]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:01.962]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:06:01.982 --> 01:06:10.306]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:06:10.606 --> 01:06:14.328]  With ARC's Heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:06:14.548 --> 01:06:19.591]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:24.353]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:06:24.553 --> 01:06:28.615]  There's Heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:06:28.695 --> 01:06:35.879]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce, and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!
[01:06:36.139 --> 01:06:37.440]  Save money, eat healthy,
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:41.982]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:42.002 --> 01:06:43.322]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.494 --> 01:07:12.098]  It's very painful for me to watch Americans being trained how to step and fetch it.
[01:07:14.039 --> 01:07:17.081]  How to bow down to the men in the black ski masks and the black helmets.
[01:07:17.101 --> 01:07:20.984]  How to have the machine guns shoved in our face and learn how to thank them for it.
[01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:23.225]  How to show our ID cards.
[01:07:23.245 --> 01:07:24.326]  How to be pulled over.
[01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:25.927]  How to be tracked and traced.
[01:07:25.987 --> 01:07:27.008]  It's such a joke.
[01:07:27.048 --> 01:07:28.369]  The borders are wide open.
[01:07:29.767 --> 01:07:32.348]  They arrested South Texas alone over a few months.
[01:07:32.368 --> 01:07:35.269]  A thousand Muslims coming across the border.
[01:07:35.289 --> 01:07:36.729]  And I'm not even saying they're terrorists, folks.
[01:07:36.749 --> 01:07:41.530]  But the point is, you know, they're claiming there's this Muslim terrorist threat that's going to get us any minute.
[01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:44.211]  But then the feds order all these illegals released.
[01:07:44.231 --> 01:07:45.951]  I mean, it shows it's a fraud!
[01:07:46.352 --> 01:07:48.992]  Internally, we're going to have magnifying glasses over us.
[01:07:49.452 --> 01:07:53.433]  It's all just part of this process of enslavement, of domestication.
[01:07:54.274 --> 01:07:56.794]  It has nothing to do with terrorism!
[01:07:57.054 --> 01:07:59.095]  The globalists are carrying it out!
[01:08:00.003 --> 01:08:02.563]  They put out new fake terror alerts!
[01:08:02.904 --> 01:08:04.604]  Three and a half, four years old!
[01:08:07.004 --> 01:08:12.565]  It's like during Christmas, we went to Orange Alert and a week into it they said, oh it was a fake alert but we're going to keep it in for another two weeks.
[01:08:13.906 --> 01:08:14.766]  It's just amazing!
[01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:17.566]  It's so transparent.
[01:08:17.586 --> 01:08:21.387]  Now we're going to have a domestic CIA, unbridled, running everything.
[01:08:24.427 --> 01:08:27.388]  Elena in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:08:28.004 --> 01:08:29.105]  Hi Alex, thank you.
[01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:41.672]  I was turned on to your program about a year and a half ago by a friend of mine, and I have to listen to you on the internet because there's no enlightened radio stations around these parts.
[01:08:41.712 --> 01:08:48.336]  The only talk station we have here is totally neocon, so they won't broadcast any other sort of program.
[01:08:49.197 --> 01:08:53.259]  However, one of the things I wanted to call in about was the subject you're talking about today.
[01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:56.421]  Right before your show, I was watching
[01:08:57.079 --> 01:09:06.384]  The Congressional hearings on C-SPAN with the Congressional Government Reform Committee and members of the 9-11 Commission.
[01:09:06.464 --> 01:09:06.985]  Yes.
[01:09:07.765 --> 01:09:12.388]  And I'll tell you, I have never been so afraid in my life.
[01:09:12.508 --> 01:09:14.649]  I mean, to be honest, I'm in my 40s.
[01:09:14.729 --> 01:09:16.130]  I spent time in the military.
[01:09:17.951 --> 01:09:21.813]  And I cannot believe what the proposals that they set out.
[01:09:21.933 --> 01:09:25.495]  I mean, they're openly discussing setting federal standards
[01:09:26.055 --> 01:09:27.356]  For drivers licenses.
[01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:29.297]  They're saying, oh, it's not a national ID card.
[01:09:29.317 --> 01:09:31.218]  It's not going to be a national ID card.
[01:09:31.758 --> 01:09:33.279]  But see, that's what I've been saying.
[01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:38.302]  Already, 42 states already are under federal control, federal parameters.
[01:09:38.622 --> 01:09:41.704]  They announced they're going to do it after it's in place, you understand?
[01:09:42.684 --> 01:09:46.987]  Oh yeah, and it's very, it's scary what they're talking about.
[01:09:47.047 --> 01:09:51.069]  Now, two of the congressmen, I'll say Congressman Kanjorski, who's from my state,
[01:09:52.014 --> 01:10:01.137]  Brought up the specter of, if anybody knows the name Lavrentiy Beria, he was the head of the NKVD in Russia, which was the precursor to the KGB.
[01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:10.259]  Did you hear our government two years ago hired Primakov, the former head of the KGB, General Primakov, to help them set up Homeland Security?
[01:10:10.479 --> 01:10:11.439]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[01:10:14.272 --> 01:10:16.854]  I mean, this is... I know, it's lunatic land!
[01:10:17.054 --> 01:10:18.215]  It's so obvious!
[01:10:18.355 --> 01:10:19.796]  I'm sorry, go ahead and finish what you were saying.
[01:10:19.876 --> 01:10:24.779]  Okay, well, what I was saying was... He brought up the Russian internal secret police.
[01:10:24.799 --> 01:10:25.159]  Go ahead.
[01:10:25.279 --> 01:10:31.463]  Right, and that Levante Beria, after Stalin died, became the Prime Minister by default because everyone was afraid of him.
[01:10:32.204 --> 01:10:38.148]  And saying, you know, well, this position that you're talking about, this National Intelligence Director, what are we going to do about this?
[01:10:38.268 --> 01:10:41.470]  Because it may sound far-fetched, but could it happen?
[01:10:41.986 --> 01:10:53.093]  And then Dennis Kucinich brought up the Patriot Act, which sort of really irritated, you know, former Senator Bob Perry, who snapped at him saying, and he turned it totally around.
[01:10:53.113 --> 01:10:57.576]  Oh, by the way, Mr. Kerry is a bloodthirsty murder-torture master.
[01:10:57.596 --> 01:11:04.941]  I mean, we've got somebody who's killed more people than, you know, John Wayne Gacy up there.
[01:11:05.101 --> 01:11:08.924]  Just a scary, chilling individual, and oh, he was telling them to shut up, huh?
[01:11:09.451 --> 01:11:24.055]  Well, basically what he did was he got really angry with Dennis Kucinich because Dennis Kucinich asked him, well what's this recommendation about having some sort of a body within the Department of Justice to see that civil rights are respected and how are you going to do that?
[01:11:24.516 --> 01:11:29.157]  And he got really angry and just flipped it around and said, well, you know,
[01:11:29.867 --> 01:11:34.051]  Ramsey Yusuf wasn't worrying about our civil rights or anybody's civil rights.
[01:11:34.111 --> 01:11:35.672]  That's right!
[01:11:36.212 --> 01:11:38.134]  We're fighting Al-Qaeda, you traitor!
[01:11:38.614 --> 01:11:41.537]  Right, and Dennis Kucinich was talking about American citizens.
[01:11:42.337 --> 01:11:48.362]  So, you can see it happening already, and plus the fact they have a lot of September 11th families there.
[01:11:48.402 --> 01:11:55.368]  Now, I haven't seen that part of the broadcast, but for all the listeners, if you get cable and you get C-SPAN, it will be rebroadcast.
[01:11:55.949 --> 01:11:58.591]  And I will say this, I lost two friends on September 11th.
[01:12:00.109 --> 01:12:03.652]  Okay, that they didn't drag out until many, many weeks later.
[01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:10.098]  And I started, I think, looking for answers about that time because things just looked to me like, what is this?
[01:12:10.199 --> 01:12:11.139]  Why didn't we catch it?
[01:12:11.179 --> 01:12:12.461]  Who was asleep at the switch?
[01:12:13.301 --> 01:12:18.086]  But I know that those two people, I mean, in honor of them, they were people that would be horrified.
[01:12:18.703 --> 01:12:20.604]  Talking about biometric ID.
[01:12:20.944 --> 01:12:23.066]  I know, and they're like, it's for the families!
[01:12:23.126 --> 01:12:27.408]  We've got three women out of thousands who are against it who are family members, victims.
[01:12:27.889 --> 01:12:28.669]  Victims of felon members.
[01:12:29.009 --> 01:12:30.630]  Oh, but we have three people who are for it.
[01:12:30.670 --> 01:12:31.831]  It's for the families.
[01:12:32.091 --> 01:12:34.493]  The families demand we kill American freedom.
[01:12:35.033 --> 01:12:36.054]  No, that's not true.
[01:12:36.354 --> 01:12:37.314]  That's not true at all.
[01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:38.555]  Yeah, it's a big fat lie.
[01:12:38.775 --> 01:12:43.418]  It's just that they're parading people around, and I just wonder, I would like your opinion on something.
[01:12:44.599 --> 01:12:45.940]  President Bush delayed.
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:47.781]  He fought this
[01:12:48.243 --> 01:12:49.404]  The 9-11 Commission.
[01:12:50.004 --> 01:12:51.065]  That's all part of theater.
[01:12:51.145 --> 01:12:52.126]  That's all part of theater.
[01:12:52.186 --> 01:12:58.290]  Yes, and now all of a sudden, we've got it right before an election and now they're all going to scramble to get something done.
[01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:01.933]  And naturally the commission appointed by him wants a total dictatorship.
[01:13:01.953 --> 01:13:02.713]  How surprising!
[01:13:02.733 --> 01:13:06.176]  Yeah, I mean, doesn't it just all fit together too well?
[01:13:07.497 --> 01:13:09.158]  It's just, it is frightening.
[01:13:09.478 --> 01:13:12.580]  And we've got all these terror alerts, which they admit again, are fake.
[01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:15.062]  But that's okay, we're going to keep the alert going.
[01:13:15.802 --> 01:13:17.784]  Well, all I can say is that I have
[01:13:19.144 --> 01:13:32.729]  I've directed as many of my friends as I can to your website, and one of the things I like about you, I had somebody send me some of your films, and the one thing that I really totally enjoy about you, Alex, is that you don't just come up with this stuff out of your head.
[01:13:32.769 --> 01:13:37.191]  You use real news sources, because people go, hey, he's just another one of those conspiracy theorists.
[01:13:37.791 --> 01:13:39.212]  You know, he's making this stuff up.
[01:13:39.232 --> 01:13:43.293]  We're getting his news from, you know, one of these idiotic agencies.
[01:13:43.333 --> 01:13:45.054]  And I said, no, you have to see this guy.
[01:13:45.094 --> 01:13:46.175]  He reads you articles.
[01:13:46.215 --> 01:13:47.195]  He shows them to you.
[01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:50.612]  For major news sources, this stuff is right under your nose.
[01:13:50.733 --> 01:13:52.094]  Yeah, it's all hidden in plain view.
[01:13:52.134 --> 01:13:54.456]  Well, I appreciate the kind words, Elena, and God bless you.
[01:13:55.897 --> 01:13:56.478]  Oh, boy.
[01:13:57.178 --> 01:13:58.500]  Clayton in Missouri.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.961]  Go ahead, Clayton, you're on the air.
[01:14:00.121 --> 01:14:01.082]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:14:01.122 --> 01:14:01.502]  Good, sir.
[01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:07.948]  Well, I was just watching the news here while I was listening to you talk to your people, and it's real interesting.
[01:14:08.008 --> 01:14:14.174]  Hurricane Alex is off the Carolina coast, and the next story they had was Smarty Jones, the racehorse, retires.
[01:14:16.604 --> 01:14:19.905]  That's kind of like when Saddam Hussein said it was all theater.
[01:14:19.945 --> 01:14:21.846]  I was like, man, that sounds like Alec 100%.
[01:14:23.066 --> 01:14:24.786]  But strange things like that happen.
[01:14:24.806 --> 01:14:27.867]  But anyway, I want to... Believe me, sir, that's a coincidence.
[01:14:28.187 --> 01:14:28.627]  Yeah, I know.
[01:14:29.107 --> 01:14:29.407]  I know.
[01:14:29.747 --> 01:14:31.047]  But it's kind of funny, too.
[01:14:31.108 --> 01:14:36.849]  But anyway, this isn't so funny, but I want to bounce the story off you and get what you think.
[01:14:37.269 --> 01:14:42.630]  I was listening to Coast to Coast last night with George Norrie in the first hour he had on Steve Quayle.
[01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:51.371]  And Steve Quayle is putting out this story that on July 15th, the Feds found a small nuke in New York City.
[01:14:51.731 --> 01:14:56.133]  They weren't able to disarm it, so they took it out to the Atlantic Ocean and they detonated it.
[01:14:57.153 --> 01:14:57.793]  Have you heard this?
[01:14:59.254 --> 01:15:00.454]  No, I haven't heard it.
[01:15:01.215 --> 01:15:05.036]  Yeah, I wasn't too sure whether to believe it or not.
[01:15:05.416 --> 01:15:06.636]  I don't have any comment on that.
[01:15:08.402 --> 01:15:13.425]  I heard you last week, you referred to the European Union as the Beast, and America as the Whore.
[01:15:14.466 --> 01:15:19.489]  Of course, you were speaking of the Book of Revelation, and the Whore is known as Mystery Babylon.
[01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:26.153]  It's real interesting, it says in Revelation 18, referring to Mystery Babylon, the Whore.
[01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:34.798]  Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning and famine, and she shall be utterly burned with fire, for strong is Yahweh who judges her.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.289]  What nuclear weapons do is form mushroom clouds of fire.
[01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:41.793]  Stone burners!
[01:15:42.615 --> 01:15:44.840]  Yes, this is just my personal opinion.
[01:15:46.127 --> 01:15:46.987]  They are, Alex.
[01:15:47.087 --> 01:15:52.188]  I do believe between now and November 2nd, I think they are going to detonate a nuclear weapon in New Jersey.
[01:15:52.208 --> 01:15:53.829]  Well, they've been saying it's going to happen.
[01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:55.829]  The White House says it will happen.
[01:15:57.209 --> 01:15:59.270]  They've been preparing everybody.
[01:15:59.370 --> 01:16:01.390]  And believe me, it isn't going to be Al-Qaeda, folks.
[01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:02.110]  No.
[01:16:03.631 --> 01:16:04.731]  No, it's going to be them.
[01:16:04.831 --> 01:16:08.672]  And they're going to re-engineer this society so bad, so fast.
[01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:12.693]  That's why we've got to get the word out now, now, now.
[01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:14.573]  God bless you, brother.
[01:16:15.191 --> 01:16:16.412]  Good to hear from you, Clayton.
[01:16:17.353 --> 01:16:18.954]  Let's talk to Chris in Tennessee.
[01:16:19.034 --> 01:16:19.815]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:16:20.095 --> 01:16:21.876]  Alex, it's an honor to talk to you.
[01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:30.163]  I work at a local CBS affiliate, and I'm surrounded by the people that we're trying to fight this fight against each day.
[01:16:30.704 --> 01:16:32.425]  And they're just blind.
[01:16:32.905 --> 01:16:34.387]  They don't want to see the truth.
[01:16:34.787 --> 01:16:40.552]  I mean, you could pull out, like, you know, documents upon documents and show them, and they just don't want to see it.
[01:16:41.272 --> 01:16:44.575]  But the reason I called was, I have
[01:16:45.111 --> 01:16:49.875]  I put together a lot of literature and some of your tapes to hand out at the SOA protest.
[01:16:50.415 --> 01:16:50.675]  Okay.
[01:16:50.716 --> 01:16:51.256]  In November.
[01:16:51.416 --> 01:16:54.679]  I mean, that was 120,000 people there last year.
[01:16:54.699 --> 01:16:55.680]  Great.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:04.707]  Get that out to the masses, but I was at a garage sale Saturday, and I found a game that was, um, it's like the D&D card DOS game.
[01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:05.968]  Called Illuminati.
[01:17:06.448 --> 01:17:06.768]  Yes!
[01:17:07.329 --> 01:17:07.649]  Yes!
[01:17:08.029 --> 01:17:09.130]  I could not believe it.
[01:17:10.031 --> 01:17:14.675]  I opened up some of the cards, and there was a card called Terrorist Nuke.
[01:17:15.208 --> 01:17:19.989]  And it was two buildings that looked, you know, two towers standing side by side.
[01:17:20.449 --> 01:17:23.230]  That game was put out by Austinite.
[01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:27.530]  I think that particular version you're talking about is about seven years old.
[01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:30.131]  1994 when it came out.
[01:17:30.731 --> 01:17:32.591]  And I was just totally shocked.
[01:17:32.812 --> 01:17:39.873]  I mean, some of the stuff that's in there is like martial law, you know, corporate takeover, you know, some of the
[01:17:40.652 --> 01:17:44.853]  Grab a headline out of today's paper and manipulate it.
[01:17:45.253 --> 01:17:48.293]  You know, it's just everything that you're talking about.
[01:17:49.054 --> 01:17:55.195]  And I showed it to some of my friends and, you know, they could not believe it, but I could take some digital photos for you.
[01:17:55.355 --> 01:17:58.175]  Yeah, you want to scan those men and email those the tips.
[01:17:58.255 --> 01:17:59.035]  We'll post them.
[01:17:59.055 --> 01:17:59.675]  That's a good idea.
[01:17:59.695 --> 01:18:00.215]  Yeah, I will.
[01:18:00.716 --> 01:18:04.876]  But I'll call you back and let you know how the SOA protest went.
[01:18:05.216 --> 01:18:07.117]  And again, for SOA, what do you mean by that?
[01:18:07.717 --> 01:18:08.537]  School of the Americas.
[01:18:09.255 --> 01:18:12.317]  That's right, up in Fort Benning, Georgia, the torture school.
[01:18:12.477 --> 01:18:14.359]  Yes.
[01:18:14.379 --> 01:18:19.042]  The military, last year when I was there, I carried my gas mask in.
[01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:22.744]  Because you never know, you know, what's going to happen.
[01:18:22.764 --> 01:18:27.968]  I mean, we go in there, you know, as peaceful protesters, and they wouldn't let me bring it in.
[01:18:28.308 --> 01:18:31.330]  And I was like, you have yours on your hip, but I can't bring mine in.
[01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:35.733]  But the military pushed the huge speakers right up against the fence,
[01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:43.959]  to drown out the people that were talking about their family that died by the hands of those they trained.
[01:18:44.099 --> 01:18:48.745]  That's right, the military directing their propaganda against American citizens.
[01:18:48.765 --> 01:18:49.446]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:49.506 --> 01:18:50.007]  Thanks for the call.
[01:18:54.602 --> 01:18:57.605]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:18:57.966 --> 01:19:06.775]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:19:07.115 --> 01:19:11.780]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.

[01:19:54.597 --> 01:19:56.838]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:19:57.259 --> 01:20:01.621]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:07.685]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:20:07.925 --> 01:20:11.988]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:20:12.268 --> 01:20:17.911]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:20:18.011 --> 01:20:20.633]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:20:22.734 --> 01:20:26.256]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 mounts.
[01:20:26.376 --> 01:20:29.057]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:20:29.397 --> 01:20:31.698]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:20:32.079 --> 01:20:35.700]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:20:36.181 --> 01:20:42.364]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:20:42.824 --> 01:20:43.784]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:20:43.804 --> 01:20:44.585]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.645 --> 01:20:44.845]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:04.273]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:05.234 --> 01:21:09.335]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[01:21:09.775 --> 01:21:18.459]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[01:21:19.259 --> 01:21:24.541]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[01:21:25.419 --> 01:21:32.721]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:40.163 --> 01:21:40.763]  Just call right now.
[01:21:52.913 --> 01:21:54.335]  Somebody wants to sue you.
[01:21:54.475 --> 01:21:57.218]  With a few keystrokes, anyone can find out your net worth.
[01:21:57.478 --> 01:22:02.683]  Everything that you've worked hard for can be taken away from you as fast as you can say, frivolous lawsuit.
[01:22:02.783 --> 01:22:07.889]  Whether it's the IRS, a vindictive ex-spouse, or an average Joe off the street, don't let them have it.
[01:22:08.049 --> 01:22:12.515]  The Asset Protection Team can show you how to protect yourself from anybody that wants to sue you.

[01:22:17.942 --> 01:22:18.163]  888-240-3337.
[01:22:18.203 --> 01:22:18.383]  That's 888-240-3337.
[01:22:24.411 --> 01:22:24.891]  I think so.
[01:23:01.089 --> 01:23:06.673]  Continuing with your phone calls, my friends, taking us in many different important directions.
[01:23:08.674 --> 01:23:18.961]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris, another Chris, this time in North Carolina, with Hurricane or Tropical Storm Alex bearing down on them.
[01:23:19.742 --> 01:23:21.103]  Welcome to the Airwaves, Chris.
[01:23:21.383 --> 01:23:22.023]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:23:22.384 --> 01:23:22.704]  Good, sir.
[01:23:23.257 --> 01:23:26.721]  This is the first time I've called the show because I listen to you all the time.
[01:23:26.781 --> 01:23:29.804]  Everybody stole my thunder.
[01:23:29.824 --> 01:23:37.171]  I was going to ask you about the people sneaking across the border in Arizona and what happened on coast-to-coast.
[01:23:39.073 --> 01:23:42.676]  I'm trying to see what else I was going to say.
[01:23:43.457 --> 01:23:44.879]  What do you think about the FCC?
[01:23:47.446 --> 01:23:49.247]  Well, I mean, they're there to consolidate.
[01:23:49.267 --> 01:23:51.208]  They're not there to keep the airwaves clean.
[01:23:51.268 --> 01:23:55.709]  It's supposed to be the people's airwaves, but they're there to consolidate and control information.
[01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.570]  And, uh, it's a very, very corrupt organization.
[01:23:59.291 --> 01:23:59.651]  Oh, okay.
[01:23:59.691 --> 01:24:04.653]  Yeah, because, um, because I called them, you know, because AT&T, they had, uh, I think they had a slam on my phone.
[01:24:04.673 --> 01:24:09.915]  You know, I don't know if you ever heard it before when, um... Yeah, I don't think the FCC are the folks that regulate that.
[01:24:09.955 --> 01:24:14.857]  I think it's, um, the telecommunications, uh, the federal bodies, um,
[01:24:16.821 --> 01:24:21.202]  That would be some of the fraud institutions that expose fraud in your state.
[01:24:22.262 --> 01:24:24.083]  Maybe you're a state attorney general, but go ahead.
[01:24:24.283 --> 01:24:24.683]  Oh, okay.
[01:24:24.903 --> 01:24:28.684]  Yeah, but I have called the FTC, you know, because I want to make a complaint about it.
[01:24:28.704 --> 01:24:38.566]  You know, the lady, she like started hollering at me and said, are you sure that this is what AT&T done to you and you better be absolutely sure before we send this information off to you?
[01:24:39.266 --> 01:24:41.947]  And she like started talking to me like I was a child or something.
[01:24:41.987 --> 01:24:42.967]  Like, oh, started hollering.
[01:24:42.987 --> 01:24:45.028]  You better be sure and all like that.
[01:24:45.088 --> 01:24:46.008]  Hung the phone up on me.
[01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.950]  I said, what do you know?
[01:24:48.371 --> 01:24:48.911]  What is this?
[01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:50.912]  Well, that's government.
[01:24:50.972 --> 01:24:51.952]  We're the slaves.
[01:24:52.052 --> 01:24:52.813]  We're bad.
[01:24:52.873 --> 01:24:54.394]  We've got to be kept in line.
[01:24:54.454 --> 01:24:55.134]  We're evil.
[01:24:55.574 --> 01:24:56.315]  We're stupid.
[01:24:56.335 --> 01:24:57.495]  They're God.
[01:24:57.575 --> 01:24:58.056]  We're not.
[01:24:58.536 --> 01:24:59.056]  Oh, okay.
[01:24:59.796 --> 01:25:04.699]  So, um, what do you think about, um, it's like a website, I think it's called Cloak & Dagger.
[01:25:04.719 --> 01:25:06.760]  Have you heard of it before?
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:08.781]  Yeah, I've interviewed the folks involved with that, yes.
[01:25:08.961 --> 01:25:13.483]  Okay, what do you think about some of the information that, you know, that comes from there?
[01:25:13.663 --> 01:25:14.224]  Is it credible?
[01:25:16.147 --> 01:25:19.710]  I mean, I think overall Sherman Schoenlick and Lenny Bloom put out some good information.
[01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:25.555]  A lot of it's very sensational, but they do a lot of research.
[01:25:25.635 --> 01:25:26.876]  I mean, I think it's overall good.
[01:25:27.476 --> 01:25:27.977]  Oh, okay.
[01:25:28.077 --> 01:25:31.439]  Also, I mean, have you ever heard anything like they were saying?
[01:25:31.479 --> 01:25:39.606]  I think they were saying like that, uh, like that's golden bones, like that Bush was doing some type of homosexual act or something like that.
[01:25:40.687 --> 01:25:43.369]  Well, yes, they do say that, and I appreciate your call.
[01:25:43.409 --> 01:25:45.411]  Let me try to elaborate on that, Chris.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:26:01.009]  What I do know is that in my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, two hour, five minute video, the first twenty minutes is news articles, mainstream news about male prostitutes being shipped in, world leaders, bizarre rituals.
[01:26:01.029 --> 01:26:15.278]  These are articles going back to the eighties, nineties, and then the New York Post last week, or now two weeks ago, and this is still at the top of the page on the right hand side, News and Focus on PrisonPlanet.com,
[01:26:17.828 --> 01:26:21.669]  Headline, Gay Porn Star Services Bohemian Grove Members.
[01:26:22.609 --> 01:26:26.170]  And so that is one of the staples of the Grove.
[01:26:27.171 --> 01:26:33.732]  And Richard Nixon, the president, we have the audio clip from his presidential library there.
[01:26:33.752 --> 01:26:43.375]  And then it's even in the news article, they talk about the clip, but we happen to have the clip, where he says that it's the most homosexual place he's ever heard of, worse than San Francisco.
[01:26:44.477 --> 01:26:47.299]  And the point is, these are our Christian conservative leaders.
[01:26:48.159 --> 01:26:51.701]  And so I don't know about the claims of Sherman, Skolnick, and Bloom.
[01:26:51.721 --> 01:26:55.363]  I mean, I know that they get in a coffin.
[01:26:55.423 --> 01:26:57.244]  I know they do weird sexual rituals.
[01:26:57.264 --> 01:26:58.105]  That's admitted.
[01:26:59.406 --> 01:27:02.768]  As for the claims that Bush has AIDS, I don't know if that's true.
[01:27:02.848 --> 01:27:04.569]  And I won't say that because I can't prove it.
[01:27:09.105 --> 01:27:11.027]  Truth is stranger than fiction, okay?
[01:27:11.208 --> 01:27:13.510]  What am I supposed to say to that?
[01:27:14.792 --> 01:27:16.193]  Let's talk to another, Eric.
[01:27:16.954 --> 01:27:18.376]  Eric in Texas, go ahead.
[01:27:18.756 --> 01:27:22.060]  Yeah, I wanted to mention the current issue of CIO Magazine.
[01:27:23.982 --> 01:27:26.105]  Headline, Poindexter comes in from the cold.
[01:27:28.237 --> 01:27:33.898]  And that's the convicted felon, Admiral Boindexter, heading up Total Information Awareness Network and the new Matrix system.
[01:27:33.998 --> 01:27:39.340]  It mentions he was convicted in 1990 on five felony counts, including lying to Congress.
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:44.461]  The conviction was subsequently overturned.
[01:27:45.281 --> 01:27:47.502]  Well, it was basically pardoned.
[01:27:47.862 --> 01:27:49.802]  Right, exactly.
[01:27:49.842 --> 01:27:52.823]  To what extent... I mean, he's five page...
[01:27:53.888 --> 01:27:55.389]  Well, Total Information Awareness never was killed.
[01:27:55.509 --> 01:27:55.749]  That's right.
[01:27:55.769 --> 01:27:56.489]  They changed the name.
[01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:36.726]  Ironically, he argues, the dissolution of TIA, in fact, was a defeat for privacy advocates because the project that they opposed has now gone underground, taking off public scrutiny.
[01:28:36.746 --> 01:28:36.926]  Yeah.
[01:28:37.466 --> 01:28:38.306]  Well, just stay there.
[01:28:38.366 --> 01:28:40.367]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:28:40.427 --> 01:28:41.007]  It's important.
[01:28:44.128 --> 01:28:45.068]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.528 --> 01:28:47.148]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.048 --> 01:28:50.709]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:58.114]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:28:58.354 --> 01:29:10.625]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:29:11.045 --> 01:29:11.445]  The U.S.
[01:29:11.505 --> 01:29:17.090]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:29:17.471 --> 01:29:19.693]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:29:21.554 --> 01:29:22.614]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:29:22.634 --> 01:29:25.495]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:29:25.595 --> 01:29:31.616]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:29:32.057 --> 01:29:35.397]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[01:32:01.247 --> 01:32:04.088]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:07.069 --> 01:32:10.070]  My friends, we have a dishonest government.
[01:32:11.190 --> 01:32:23.555]  Here in Austin, Texas, when I get involved in city and county affairs, if you start fighting a program or proposal, they'll just change the name of the program and change a few words of the proposal and then sneak it through on you.
[01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:31.572]  But again, the general public just takes government at face value, or doesn't even investigate government, doesn't even know how government works.
[01:32:32.472 --> 01:32:35.272]  And it's a normal operation, so they're able to do all of this.
[01:32:35.312 --> 01:32:46.875]  If we all simply got involved, picked one or two issues, and spent maybe a couple hours a week being involved in our government, we would have an incredibly free and dynamic society.
[01:32:48.556 --> 01:32:53.337]  But Total Information Awareness, run by the felon Poindexter, was nothing but the
[01:32:54.341 --> 01:33:13.012]  The PR, Public Relations stunt name of the National Security Agency, or the NSA, the biggest known federal spy agency, was nothing but the public manifestation, and it was an all-seeing eye and a pyramid, you all saw the logo, radiating the earth.
[01:33:14.112 --> 01:33:20.756]  And they said, everything you buy, everything you sell, every credit card purchase, every divorce record, everything is going to be in it.
[01:33:23.557 --> 01:33:26.860]  And then there was a big outcry, and they had this staged event in D.C.
[01:33:27.141 --> 01:33:28.462]  Oh, well, we killed the program.
[01:33:28.482 --> 01:33:42.335]  Then they actually, it seems to be the rule, they then doubled funding under three different programs, one of them called the Matrix System, which is bulldozing ahead at the state level, federally funded, to collect every piece of data.
[01:33:43.712 --> 01:33:48.535]  When you use the customer loyalty card, or you do whatever, all that system, that is bought from the grocery stores.
[01:33:49.155 --> 01:34:02.943]  Even USA Today admits, when you buy a pizza, it automatically, through a computer with a major pizza supplier, runs through a database to see if you've got a felony, and it flags the police to come arrest you at what address you're at, if your address has changed.
[01:34:02.983 --> 01:34:04.864]  I mean, that's the freedom, folks!
[01:34:06.145 --> 01:34:11.828]  Worse than 1984, worse than Soviet Russia, worse than East Germany under the Stasi.
[01:34:13.946 --> 01:34:21.373]  And so our listener is reading from some magazine article about, oh, it was really a blow to civil libertarians because now it's gone underground.
[01:34:21.413 --> 01:34:31.102]  And a few weeks ago we read the article about, I think it was from Capitol Hill Blue, of where Total Information Awareness Network is based there in Virginia.
[01:34:33.444 --> 01:34:35.606]  But, I mean, you know, it's like the TIPS program.
[01:34:35.666 --> 01:34:38.369]  The cable guy, the exterminator is going to spy on you and
[01:34:38.982 --> 01:34:43.145]  They're going to recruit the neighborhood watch to spy on you and then they hear, oh well that got killed.
[01:34:43.185 --> 01:34:44.106]  That program got defeated.
[01:34:44.146 --> 01:34:56.816]  Then you find out that you go to a college football game and there's retired military people who've now been hired back in military outfits searching people's bags and shoving folks around just training you how to live like a slave.
[01:34:59.338 --> 01:35:01.039]  Again, this is all in place now.
[01:35:01.079 --> 01:35:03.321]  They're just trying to incrementally get used to seeing it.
[01:35:04.202 --> 01:35:07.104]  So when they show you Boston or DC or New Jersey
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:13.742]  We're New York with troops and military and black uniforms and helicopters and machine guns.
[01:35:15.343 --> 01:35:17.464]  It's all part of the acclamation.
[01:35:18.924 --> 01:35:21.165]  Because they've got a lot of horrible things planned for you.
[01:35:21.185 --> 01:35:23.266]  They've got to build in your mind.
[01:35:23.666 --> 01:35:27.728]  They've got to sell you on the bad guys really being the good guys.
[01:35:29.689 --> 01:35:37.752]  And then you hear, oh the tips program's back and everybody's spying on everybody and it's to fight crime because crime supports terror and so there you have it.
[01:35:40.686 --> 01:35:46.427]  Wait till you hear how they're purging the libraries of constitutional books, law books, U.S.
[01:35:46.527 --> 01:35:47.027]  codes.
[01:35:47.087 --> 01:35:47.948]  You can't get to it.
[01:35:47.968 --> 01:35:57.990]  I've got the president of the American Library Association coming on in about 25 minutes in the third hour, so I shouldn't laugh.
[01:35:58.070 --> 01:36:08.332]  It's just... I can't believe how concerted and sophisticated and cold-blooded all this is.
[01:36:09.108 --> 01:36:12.689]  And then just the abject, total, willful ignorance of the yuppies.
[01:36:14.170 --> 01:36:16.471]  Who think this is to keep them safe.
[01:36:16.571 --> 01:36:19.912]  No, this is to clamp down on you while they suck you dry.
[01:36:21.072 --> 01:36:21.753]  Ya fools!
[01:36:23.273 --> 01:36:28.315]  So a lot of you will cower in fear and say, well I better subconsciously make the decision to just deny it and join it.
[01:36:28.775 --> 01:36:32.857]  A lot of you are smart and you engage in double thinking and you decide to just go ahead and join this.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.041]  Go ahead and go along with it.
[01:36:35.141 --> 01:36:36.161]  Somehow you'll be safe.
[01:36:36.601 --> 01:36:37.922]  That's the worst possible course.
[01:36:38.102 --> 01:36:39.183]  Worst possible course, of course.
[01:36:40.303 --> 01:36:43.985]  But, again, you play a little mind trick with yourself.
[01:36:44.005 --> 01:36:45.646]  The trick of all cowards.
[01:36:45.906 --> 01:36:47.847]  A real coward doesn't even know they're a coward.
[01:36:48.027 --> 01:36:49.588]  They don't even admit to themselves they're a coward.
[01:36:49.608 --> 01:36:53.069]  If you're going to be a coward, just wallow in it.
[01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:56.071]  Men out there that don't love your families.
[01:36:56.211 --> 01:36:57.752]  Women out there that don't love your families.
[01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:00.053]  Just pathetic.
[01:37:01.238 --> 01:37:02.398]  So you want to live in tyranny?
[01:37:02.418 --> 01:37:03.619]  You want to see the death of America?
[01:37:03.639 --> 01:37:04.219]  You're going to see it.
[01:37:04.239 --> 01:37:05.859]  You're going to see it.
[01:37:06.399 --> 01:37:07.560]  You're seeing it right now.
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:09.560]  And it's only the beginning.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:17.422]  All this police state is about clamping down as they take your economic future, as they take your bank account, as they take everything you've got.
[01:37:19.683 --> 01:37:22.024]  As they draft your children for eternal wars.
[01:37:22.444 --> 01:37:23.364]  A hundred year war.
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:26.621]  As they implant you with the chip.
[01:37:27.122 --> 01:37:28.903]  As they track and trace everything you do.
[01:37:29.283 --> 01:37:31.205]  As they give you the national sales tax.
[01:37:32.026 --> 01:37:33.507]  Which Bush is now announcing, by the way.
[01:37:34.768 --> 01:37:37.010]  Which will be on top of the income tax, by the way.
[01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:40.673]  Sold to you by phony conservatives, who aren't real conservatives.
[01:37:41.593 --> 01:37:43.395]  You better get your mind around it.
[01:37:43.435 --> 01:37:44.536]  You better learn quick.
[01:37:44.896 --> 01:37:47.278]  You better make it the focus of your life to fight this thing.
[01:37:48.507 --> 01:37:54.150]  Chris, no we're talking to Eric, Eric in Texas, finish up what you were saying out of this, what's the magazine again?
[01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:57.032]  CIO, Chief Information Officer.
[01:37:57.552 --> 01:37:58.632]  Oh yeah, okay.
[01:37:58.692 --> 01:38:14.481]  People have quoted it out of it before, and it just, they use all the terms, CIA, TIA, everything, but the last thing I want to say is, the largest form of mental illness is denial, and people will be deceived any way they can,
[01:38:15.407 --> 01:38:19.310]  And you always speak of the Mark of the Beast, and it isn't going to be a physical mark.
[01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:26.515]  Although I don't believe taking the microchip is anything that any sane person should do, but it is a mark of deception.
[01:38:27.176 --> 01:38:28.857]  And people will be deceived by that.
[01:38:28.997 --> 01:38:30.698]  They just can't get it through their head.
[01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:35.301]  I mean, if you have a mark of a Christian, if you do the right thing, you're obviously not going to take the Mark of the Beast.
[01:38:36.142 --> 01:38:44.368]  But before I go, this last article said, Before the total information of where this project was dissolved, it had made progress on several fronts.
[01:38:44.673 --> 01:38:50.835]  He created Vanilla World, a simulation not unlike the popular Electronic Arts Sims computer game.
[01:38:51.375 --> 01:38:55.197]  Vanilla World had about 2 million people, including terrorists, making transactions.
[01:38:56.017 --> 01:39:02.359]  And the goal of the simulation was to see whether patterns of suspicious transactions would rise up above the noise of normal activity.
[01:39:03.679 --> 01:39:11.162]  It has a few pictures of him smoking his pipe, thinking that, I guess that he's just... I was pretty amazed by the article itself.
[01:39:11.815 --> 01:39:14.437]  Yeah, in the past, for some reason, they would send me that magazine.
[01:39:14.457 --> 01:39:15.358]  I haven't been getting it lately.
[01:39:15.378 --> 01:39:16.079]  Maybe you send it to me.
[01:39:16.099 --> 01:39:17.340]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:17.881]  Yeah, thank you, sir.
[01:39:18.341 --> 01:39:19.062]  I appreciate it.
[01:39:20.503 --> 01:39:26.989]  Yeah, it's... And then, see, you get arrested because you're a person of interest.
[01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:30.472]  And you disappear, and there's no process, no liberty.
[01:39:31.724 --> 01:39:33.085]  No checks and balances.
[01:39:33.725 --> 01:39:35.186]  Well, we've just got to trust the government.
[01:39:35.226 --> 01:39:36.686]  You know, things changed on 9-11.
[01:39:36.746 --> 01:39:39.027]  Yeah, they told you that within 30 minutes of it happening.
[01:39:39.448 --> 01:39:40.708]  Things have changed now!
[01:39:40.768 --> 01:39:42.809]  Gotta give the liberties up, okay?
[01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:46.651]  Fred in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[01:39:46.671 --> 01:39:47.231]  Alex.
[01:39:47.791 --> 01:39:48.132]  Hello.
[01:39:49.432 --> 01:39:57.576]  I don't know if your eyes are going to glaze over if I bring this up, but I did find a library software manual
[01:40:00.362 --> 01:40:18.055]  And I just want to say that they have a tremendous database that they say that they're not going to use, but it has all kinds of things in here like academic status of the patron, social security number, telephone number, driver license number, company name.
[01:40:20.577 --> 01:40:27.843]  These library patron databases are much bigger than you might think by filling out an application.
[01:40:28.419 --> 01:40:33.922]  Yeah, well, for those that just joined us, we've got the president of the American Library Association.
[01:40:34.822 --> 01:40:35.662]  She's in a board meeting.
[01:40:35.702 --> 01:40:37.363]  If she doesn't come on, it'll be the director.
[01:40:37.683 --> 01:40:40.384]  Yeah, and the other thing... If you want, I'll put you on hold.
[01:40:40.405 --> 01:40:41.265]  You can talk to them.
[01:40:41.605 --> 01:40:43.946]  Yeah, well, I... I'm just going to put you on hold now, then.
[01:40:43.966 --> 01:40:45.507]  You're going to have to hold about 20 minutes.
[01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:46.587]  Okay.
[01:40:46.867 --> 01:40:48.968]  Okay, I'll just put you on hold, then, if you want to talk to them.
[01:40:49.409 --> 01:40:56.652]  Yeah, well, under Patriot Act, everything you do is tracked in a library, but nobody pays attention because the bookstores haven't complained that the bookstores are doing it, too.
[01:40:57.945 --> 01:41:00.146]  And that's in section, uh, what?
[01:41:00.166 --> 01:41:00.146]  213?
[01:41:02.506 --> 01:41:05.087]  So, uh, we'll be... Wait till you hear the news stuff, folks.
[01:41:05.167 --> 01:41:06.368]  It dwarfs all of that.
[01:41:06.708 --> 01:41:08.888]  They're actually shredding books, okay?
[01:41:09.348 --> 01:41:12.089]  The Feds have ordered hundreds of books shredded.
[01:41:13.049 --> 01:41:14.510]  And it's law books.
[01:41:15.250 --> 01:41:16.090]  It's U.S.
[01:41:16.150 --> 01:41:16.550]  Code.
[01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:17.991]  They do not want you reading it.
[01:41:19.471 --> 01:41:24.173]  Um... Let's talk to Maryland in California.
[01:41:24.213 --> 01:41:25.093]  Maryland, go ahead.
[01:41:25.828 --> 01:41:27.850]  Hi Alex, I'm a first-time caller.
[01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:52.809]  I've been listening about two months and I haven't heard you mention anything about this story out of Associated Press on July 30th that Ridge tells colleagues he may retire and then he's attending a, he's working, Homeland Security was working the door at Bill Gates' party and evidently, see it says, well I was thinking
[01:41:53.376 --> 01:42:00.559]  Well, I guess, uh, Ridge, I thought I saw where Ridge was attending the party, but there was speculation that Ridge may be hired by Gates.
[01:42:00.619 --> 01:42:02.000]  Have you heard anything about that?
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:05.082]  Uh, yes, I, uh, heard it on the radio yesterday.
[01:42:05.102 --> 01:42:10.184]  I heard local, local, I heard the national news feed locally talking about it.
[01:42:10.844 --> 01:42:13.946]  Well, they say Ridge is probably going to get a new White House job.
[01:42:14.026 --> 01:42:16.447]  He may jump to this new Intelligence Chief job.
[01:42:17.356 --> 01:42:19.798]  See, they're just creating agencies as fast as they can.
[01:42:20.178 --> 01:42:23.299]  Domestic, KGB type, with actual KGB advising them.
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:24.760]  Associated Press, by the way.
[01:42:25.901 --> 01:42:28.002]  So, I mean, what do you say?
[01:42:28.122 --> 01:42:29.463]  Blockhead is just a puppet.
[01:42:30.764 --> 01:42:39.008]  Well, you know, the story actually says, and my take was that Ridge was trying to get out from under this evil possibly.
[01:42:39.028 --> 01:42:41.930]  I don't know, the story says he... Let me tell you, Ridge is very evil.
[01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:43.311]  I can look at him and tell you he's evil.
[01:42:44.611 --> 01:42:49.857]  The way he acts, the enjoyment, he's got... No, I mean, using criminology, he's got psychopath written all over him.
[01:42:51.438 --> 01:42:53.500]  I'm not kidding, that man's a dangerous psychopath.
[01:42:53.601 --> 01:42:55.943]  Well, I have no doubt about that.
[01:42:55.983 --> 01:43:05.874]  He claims he has to put his children through school and earn more money, and that was why he's quitting, so that isn't... Sure, yeah, the governor, yeah, worth tens of millions, he's real poor.
[01:43:06.394 --> 01:43:07.315]  Well, that's interesting.
[01:43:07.395 --> 01:43:08.775]  I appreciate all the work you do.
[01:43:08.815 --> 01:43:11.737]  I'm looking forward to getting your audit-free videos.
[01:43:11.797 --> 01:43:14.418]  I've never seen your stuff before, but I listen to you.
[01:43:14.458 --> 01:43:15.439]  I'm addicted now.
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:17.460]  Thank you so much.
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:19.861]  Well, ma'am, God bless you, and thanks for the call, Marilyn.
[01:43:19.921 --> 01:43:23.863]  We'll take one more call to cover news the rest of the show, and we've got guests coming up.
[01:43:23.904 --> 01:43:24.964]  We'll take your calls then, too.
[01:43:25.324 --> 01:43:27.045]  Brooke in Maryland, go ahead.
[01:43:28.286 --> 01:43:28.806]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:28.966 --> 01:43:30.847]  This is actually Brooke in Rhode Island.
[01:43:31.187 --> 01:43:31.968]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:43:32.888 --> 01:43:35.670]  I have a comment and a question for you.
[01:43:37.038 --> 01:43:39.340]  Are you ready to shape the global agenda?
[01:43:41.543 --> 01:43:47.469]  I just saw this ad in The Economist from London, in the jobs section.
[01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:51.333]  It's from the World Economic Forum.
[01:43:51.353 --> 01:43:55.838]  They're looking for someone who's ready to help shape the global agenda.
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:44:08.227]  a director for global and regional agendas and they discussed the whole position and I was totally blown away by it and I can actually give you the website for it if you'd like to apply for the job.
[01:44:08.707 --> 01:44:10.088]  Oh yes, I'm sure they want me!
[01:44:12.370 --> 01:44:22.356]  But Alex, the question I have to ask you and I don't know if you can give me a take on this but I've asked a few people around here and no one can figure it out.
[01:44:24.077 --> 01:44:25.898]  In the last three or four months
[01:44:26.613 --> 01:44:34.097]  I have noticed Rupert Murdoch's New York Post doing a lot of very provocative reporting.
[01:44:34.117 --> 01:44:39.179]  Yeah, the homosexual pleasure slaves, the Bohemian Grove.
[01:44:39.599 --> 01:44:41.380]  Well, that was not the only one.
[01:44:42.021 --> 01:44:54.507]  When the beheading of Nicholas Berg occurred, in an article on their opinion page, they referred to the beheading as the Feast of the Sacrifice.
[01:44:55.765 --> 01:44:57.666]  Which I thought was very provocative.
[01:44:58.266 --> 01:45:16.636]  They also really ran after Princess Alexandria, the Duchess of Kent, and the wife of Prince Michael, the Duke of Kent, and slammed her and smeared her for something like about a month, including, I thought, rather unfairly.
[01:45:17.396 --> 01:45:23.299]  On the other hand, the Duchess of Kent and Prince Michael is the leading top
[01:45:23.772 --> 01:45:27.675]  Remason in the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth.
[01:45:28.275 --> 01:45:33.459]  And I thought that was really rather strange that Rupert Murdoch would slam anyone with that nature.
[01:45:33.499 --> 01:45:34.660]  Well, let me break this down.
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:43.366]  Number one, those type of reports sell, so they'll allow some of the truth out, and as you say, smears out.
[01:45:43.686 --> 01:45:49.610]  Also, there's a lot of evidence that there is real internal infighting inside the New World Order going on right now.
[01:45:50.359 --> 01:46:00.186]  Yes, I was trying... You know, these people, Alex, I don't know if you're aware of the fact, but people like Edmund Safra, Lord Rothmeir, and Robert Maxwell.
[01:46:00.547 --> 01:46:07.912]  Robert Maxwell was literally pushed off his yacht and thrown to the sharks and eaten by the sharks, and he was a major media mogul in Britain.
[01:46:08.372 --> 01:46:16.859]  So, my question is, what do you think Murdoch's agenda is in presenting all this provocative information?
[01:46:16.879 --> 01:46:18.420]  Man, that'd take hours to get into.
[01:46:19.590 --> 01:46:24.973]  Well, it's only... I've also noticed that it's... Well, you notice... Let me stop you.
[01:46:24.993 --> 01:46:27.094]  These people blackmail each other and stuff, too.
[01:46:27.694 --> 01:46:33.196]  Remember when Fox came out and said 160 Israeli spies arrested following Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:33.677 --> 01:46:34.457]  Explosives.
[01:46:34.497 --> 01:46:35.538]  They could be terrorists.
[01:46:36.038 --> 01:46:36.138]  Right.
[01:46:36.158 --> 01:46:39.239]  They did a couple days on that and then suddenly shut up about it.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.100]  Okay, so... Yeah.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:47.103]  So, and I'm not saying Israel was behind the attacks, because the point is, if our government arrested these Israelis,
[01:46:47.859 --> 01:46:51.281]  For prior knowledge of the attacks, that means our government had prior knowledge, too, see?
[01:46:52.162 --> 01:46:55.564]  But we have those saved screenshot articles on the website, because they took them down.
[01:46:56.184 --> 01:46:58.066]  So, you see... Well, let me finish.
[01:46:58.086 --> 01:46:59.467]  You wanted to ask a question.
[01:46:59.907 --> 01:47:00.287]  Okay.
[01:47:00.387 --> 01:47:05.590]  People will bring out news articles to then get something they want from somebody else and then withdraw them.
[01:47:05.811 --> 01:47:07.011]  Now, I don't know if that's the case.
[01:47:07.051 --> 01:47:07.872]  That's speculation.
[01:47:08.757 --> 01:47:19.146]  Well, you know there was a major masonic murder in a lodge in Long Island where a mason... Yeah, they blew his head off and the masonic cops showed up and nobody got in trouble and they had guillotines in black coffins, yeah.
[01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:26.212]  Yes, well it was interesting who reported that because the Daily News, owned by Mort Zuckerman, did not report that.
[01:47:26.592 --> 01:47:31.436]  The New York Post made a big thing out of it and also Newsday, which is on Long Island.
[01:47:31.756 --> 01:47:39.420]  But it was, and also the Freemasons in New York were suspended from having Lodge meetings, which I thought was very interesting.
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:47.504]  But Rupert Murdoch seems to be reporting all this, and in great depth, in comparison to everyone else.
[01:47:47.684 --> 01:47:53.607]  And I was just wondering what the guy's agenda could be, because he must be an Illuminati, or he must be a Freemason.
[01:47:53.627 --> 01:47:57.929]  Okay, let me answer your question, and I'm going to let you go, because I've got some news I want to cover before this hour ends.
[01:48:00.905 --> 01:48:05.488]  You know, Rupert Murdoch's got a TV show, an hour special about not going to the moon.
[01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:09.851]  Rupert Murdoch has shows about the UN taking over the national parks.
[01:48:10.772 --> 01:48:12.093]  And I know that show was accurate.
[01:48:13.594 --> 01:48:15.075]  What is it, Lost Freedoms or something?
[01:48:15.095 --> 01:48:16.116]  It was on like three years ago.
[01:48:16.917 --> 01:48:18.037]  They have all this stuff.
[01:48:18.097 --> 01:48:19.518]  And then that gains your confidence.
[01:48:19.558 --> 01:48:23.942]  It's like O'Reilly exposing the open borders and then suddenly being for them.
[01:48:24.862 --> 01:48:27.464]  So, they put in enough to give credibility.
[01:48:27.504 --> 01:48:28.485]  They know what sells.
[01:48:28.625 --> 01:48:29.946]  Okay, people want to hear about this stuff.
[01:48:30.563 --> 01:48:31.704]  I mean, take this broadcast.
[01:48:32.024 --> 01:48:36.748]  You put this on your little radio station that has no ratings for a year, you're going to get big ratings.
[01:48:37.188 --> 01:48:38.829]  Station after station after station.
[01:48:39.450 --> 01:48:40.771]  But we just give it all to you.
[01:48:41.631 --> 01:48:41.952]  Okay?
[01:48:42.232 --> 01:48:44.073]  But a Murdoch will give you some of it.
[01:48:44.514 --> 01:48:47.376]  Because they know it sells, and then mix the propaganda in with it.
[01:48:48.276 --> 01:48:53.100]  Well, that's the easiest, simplest, most basic answer I can give you.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:54.141]  And it's a good question, Brock.
[01:48:54.481 --> 01:48:55.462]  We should all think about that.
[01:48:55.882 --> 01:48:58.264]  This broadcast is about a process of thinking about that.
[01:48:59.771 --> 01:49:01.332]  Alright, I'm going to come back in a few news stories.
[01:49:01.372 --> 01:49:05.653]  Then we've got the President of the American Library Association.
[01:49:06.654 --> 01:49:11.056]  By the way, Stephanie, they're calling in at the end of this hour, so be ready for that.
[01:49:12.576 --> 01:49:15.377]  And so, that's coming up.
[01:49:15.437 --> 01:49:17.398]  I want to get into what they're doing in the libraries.
[01:49:17.798 --> 01:49:19.199]  This is new information.
[01:49:19.219 --> 01:49:22.600]  This is a press release by the American Library Association.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:24.361]  So, stay with us.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:26.722]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:49:27.182 --> 01:49:33.547]  I want to challenge all of you to visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or PrisonPlanet.tv today.
[01:49:34.328 --> 01:49:39.753]  I want to challenge you to visit the SecureSafe online shopping cart and get some of the videos or books.
[01:49:40.313 --> 01:49:47.920]  When we get back, I'll briefly give you the phone number and mailing address as well, tell you about some of the titles, then we'll launch into this news article, and then we'll get to those guests.
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:51.803]  So, the end of the second hour, straight ahead in the third hour, please stay with us.
[01:49:53.999 --> 01:49:58.348]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.528 --> 01:50:02.897]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:05.196 --> 01:50:07.497]  Use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:50:07.577 --> 01:50:08.898]  A New World Order?
[01:50:09.658 --> 01:50:10.419]  Hammer.
[01:50:10.659 --> 01:50:14.881]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.941 --> 01:50:21.865]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.985 --> 01:50:24.006]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.226 --> 01:50:34.768]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.988 --> 01:50:40.369]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:50:40.869 --> 01:50:44.770]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:45.250]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:45.330 --> 01:50:47.050]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:53.371 --> 01:50:59.615]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:50:59.735 --> 01:51:05.919]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:06.179 --> 01:51:14.644]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:14.884 --> 01:51:21.888]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:22.188 --> 01:51:27.031]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:27.231 --> 01:51:32.655]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:32.975 --> 01:51:36.077]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:36.398 --> 01:51:44.363]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:44.403 --> 01:51:44.983]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:54.490]  I think so.
[01:52:09.765 --> 01:52:10.365]  I think so.

[01:52:39.243 --> 01:52:42.326]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.506 --> 01:52:48.352]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:56.534 --> 01:53:02.558]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:03.179 --> 01:53:06.141]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:09.103 --> 01:53:22.792]  Alright, we've got Carol Bray-Casiano, the president of the American Library Association, joining us here in a minute or two, and she'll be with us for about 20 minutes into the next hour, maybe even 30 if she has time to take some calls.
[01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:25.731]  This is a big deal.
[01:53:26.031 --> 01:53:26.771]  New developments.
[01:53:26.811 --> 01:53:28.072]  They put out a press release.
[01:53:28.212 --> 01:53:30.654]  It's on Infowars.com right now.
[01:53:30.694 --> 01:53:32.435]  It's also at BuzzFlash.com.
[01:53:33.015 --> 01:53:41.841]  But before we do that, if you want to get my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, if you want to get The Masters of Terror, if you want to get George Humphrey's new 9-11 video, 9-11, The Great Illusion,
[01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:53.417]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:54.378 --> 01:53:57.841]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:53:58.581 --> 01:54:12.311]  Now in section 213 and 215 they have provisions about breaking in your house, taking what they want, leaving stuff, not letting you tell anybody that you were searched, making you be a spy for them, then you can't report that you've been told to be a spy.
[01:54:13.206 --> 01:54:18.188]  And the library associations at the state and federal level, national level, have fought this.
[01:54:18.628 --> 01:54:21.050]  The bookstores haven't talked about it because they don't want to scare you.
[01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:22.750]  They have to do this too.
[01:54:22.890 --> 01:54:26.012]  Borders Books has been caught and others under this.
[01:54:27.092 --> 01:54:32.575]  And you think it's not for you, all suspicion of crime is considered terrorism in Section 802.
[01:54:33.195 --> 01:54:36.596]  The new development that I learned of this morning blew me away.
[01:54:37.797 --> 01:54:40.278]  Book burning folks, or I should say book shredding.
[01:54:41.129 --> 01:54:45.673]  They are going to get rid of all these publications about government, the U.S.
[01:54:45.713 --> 01:54:51.697]  Code, about asset forfeiture seizure, all this stuff, laws, so you don't know how to defend yourself.
[01:54:52.418 --> 01:54:55.440]  Prisons are moving to block prisoners from getting access to this, too.
[01:54:55.901 --> 01:54:59.664]  Now, when the government starts not wanting you to know the law, this is tyranny.
[01:55:00.504 --> 01:55:07.350]  And joining us, again, is Carol Bray-Casillano, the President of the National Library Association.
[01:55:09.432 --> 01:55:11.373]  It's good to have you on, Carol.
[01:55:11.453 --> 01:55:12.633]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:55:12.653 --> 01:55:13.394]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:55:13.434 --> 01:55:13.974]  My pleasure.
[01:55:14.474 --> 01:55:16.795]  We've just got a few minutes here before this hour ends.
[01:55:16.835 --> 01:55:21.277]  In a nutshell, this new abomination, can you tell us about it?
[01:55:21.917 --> 01:55:22.637]  I sure can.
[01:55:22.997 --> 01:55:29.880]  My understanding is that the Department of Justice asked the Superintendent of Documents, who oversees what we call depository libraries,
[01:55:30.330 --> 01:55:32.471]  that holds federal documents.
[01:55:32.872 --> 01:55:49.621]  To destroy these publications that you were just referring to, there was a public law, the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, and a compilation of select federal asset forfeiture statutes, and then there were some forms related to that.
[01:55:50.261 --> 01:55:57.946]  And depository libraries, federal depository libraries, were asked to withdraw these materials immediately and destroy them.
[01:55:58.867 --> 01:56:02.850]  Because the Department of Justice has determined that these materials are for internal use only.
[01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:13.137]  And as librarians, we immediately became concerned about that because these were federal laws, which would be fairly readily available anywhere else.
[01:56:14.338 --> 01:56:19.342]  And we were concerned about why these were being, we were asked to destroy these.
[01:56:19.362 --> 01:56:27.467]  So the American Library Association put forth a Freedom of Information Act request to find out
[01:56:28.604 --> 01:56:32.946]  from the Department of Justice why these materials were going to be removed.
[01:56:33.486 --> 01:56:40.729]  And the Department of Justice subsequently asked libraries to disregard their instructions to withdraw those publications.
[01:56:41.249 --> 01:56:45.631]  So basically, the bottom line is we will not be destroying those materials.
[01:56:46.091 --> 01:56:48.332]  But again, they tried to sneak this through, and you know,
[01:56:49.463 --> 01:56:52.205]  This is personal for me because I have congressmen and women on.
[01:56:52.566 --> 01:56:53.626]  I promoted a petition.
[01:56:53.907 --> 01:57:01.693]  This broadcast in 2000 helped pass that law that they just can't grab your house and take it without you having a trial.
[01:57:01.993 --> 01:57:06.417]  And now they don't want people to know how to defend themselves and use this congressional reform.
[01:57:07.698 --> 01:57:09.539]  It was very unusual.
[01:57:09.579 --> 01:57:13.142]  I mean, we were very surprised as librarians that this would come down.
[01:57:14.003 --> 01:57:18.887]  Is it fair to say, Carol, that if you would have gone along with this, they probably would have wanted you to shred other stuff?
[01:57:19.716 --> 01:57:23.498]  Well, we have been asked occasionally to destroy other materials.
[01:57:24.059 --> 01:57:31.424]  Typically, it's with materials that there's a mistake in the material or the material's out of date.
[01:57:31.564 --> 01:57:37.688]  It's very rare that materials are withdrawn, are asked to be withdrawn.
[01:57:37.748 --> 01:57:41.030]  Well, I'll tell you what, we're going to talk about this, the Patriot Act, everything else on the other side.
[01:57:41.050 --> 01:57:42.070]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:42.090 --> 01:57:42.691]  Stick with us, Carol.
[01:57:50.456 --> 01:57:54.639]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:56.141]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.861 --> 01:57:57.742]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.423 --> 01:58:02.085]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.626 --> 01:58:06.749]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.652 --> 01:58:18.739]  Alright, my friends, into the third hour, blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Oregon to Rhode Island, from Austin, Texas to Kansas City.
[01:58:20.245 --> 01:58:22.366]  We're joined by Carol Bray-Casillano.
[01:58:22.386 --> 01:58:24.726]  She is the president of the American Library Association.
[01:58:25.126 --> 01:58:26.327]  They put out a press release.
[01:58:26.387 --> 01:58:28.407]  It's oninfowars.com.
[01:58:28.427 --> 01:58:31.948]  We'll give you their website a little bit later as well, so have a pen and paper ready for that.
[01:58:33.869 --> 01:58:36.709]  They've been harassing the libraries, telling them to spy on people.
[01:58:36.729 --> 01:58:38.170]  The libraries have been fighting back.
[01:58:38.190 --> 01:58:39.530]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:42.951]  Now they wanted them to destroy information about
[01:58:44.165 --> 01:58:52.539]  Civil and criminal forfeiture procedures, select criminal forfeiture forms, select federal asset forfeiture statutes, and a lot more!
[01:58:53.303 --> 01:58:59.004]  And the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 that says that they can't just take your house and car without a trial.
[01:58:59.104 --> 01:59:00.524]  That they've got to give you your stuff back.
[01:59:00.885 --> 01:59:02.205]  That you have to have a trial first.
[01:59:02.665 --> 01:59:04.545]  They want this away from the public.
[01:59:04.585 --> 01:59:06.206]  They don't want you having access to it.
[01:59:06.506 --> 01:59:11.207]  Then we're going to get into the Patriot Act and what that's done to the libraries and how they've been standing up to it.
[01:59:12.207 --> 01:59:16.008]  Again, Carol, Bray, Cassiano, please continue where you left off.
[01:59:16.508 --> 01:59:17.908]  Sure, I'd be happy to, Alex.
[01:59:18.548 --> 01:59:41.567]  Basically, as I was saying, the superintendent of documents who oversees these depository programs for federal documents will sometimes ask depositories to return a publication to them or to the GPO, which is the Government Printing Office, or destroy it, usually because it's defective or there's a mistake in the material or something like that, and libraries have to comply.
[01:59:41.727 --> 01:59:43.869]  I can tell you that there have only been
[01:59:44.571 --> 01:59:52.034]  About probably less than 30 items that have been pulled since 1995 out of the quarter of a million titles that we get.
[01:59:52.854 --> 01:59:59.457]  But it always is cause for concern, and librarians typically do look at what material is being asked to be deleted.
[01:59:59.497 --> 02:00:05.480]  If it's something that's out of date, if it's been succeeded by something newer, that's understandable.
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:13.423]  But what caused concern for us as librarians, as I mentioned earlier, was the fact that we were talking about a public law, something that is readily available
[02:00:14.139 --> 02:00:22.606]  In many other locations, and so it did raise concern as to why this particular material was being asked to be withdrawn.
[02:00:23.287 --> 02:00:31.073]  The information we were given was that it was because the Department of Justice has determined that these materials are for internal use only, and that was not defined.
[02:00:33.735 --> 02:00:43.043]  Now, this smacks of the Orwellian term memory hole, and even getting rid of old laws that have been overturned, you still want to have a record of that,
[02:00:44.076 --> 02:00:54.192]  But in this case, this was the current law, the current code, and once you stood up to them, as you said in the last hour, they then backed off when you did a FOIA request.
[02:00:54.613 --> 02:00:55.374]  That's correct.
[02:00:55.394 --> 02:00:57.598]  Can you elaborate on... I mean, that's pretty suspicious.
[02:00:58.354 --> 02:00:58.574]  Right.
[02:00:58.634 --> 02:01:06.717]  We wanted to get some kind of official rationale from the Department of Justice about these documents and why the Department of Justice felt they should be removed from libraries.
[02:01:07.137 --> 02:01:14.639]  So the American Library Association quickly submitted, and I would say quickly because we needed to act right away, because there's a deadline by which these materials have to be destroyed.
[02:01:15.159 --> 02:01:19.521]  So we submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for those withdrawn materials.
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:31.436]  Right after the submission of our request, the Department of Justice apparently took another look at the issue and asked libraries to disregard their previous instructions to withdraw these publications.
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:50.111]  And they said that those materials were intended only for internal training use of Department of Justice personnel, and as such were inappropriately distributed to depository libraries for an administrative oversight, but that the department had determined that these materials are not sufficiently sensitive to require removal from the depository library system.
[02:01:50.371 --> 02:01:56.535]  And again, we're talking about the Select Federal Asset Forfeiture Statute, the laws.
[02:01:56.555 --> 02:01:57.336]  That's correct.
[02:01:57.736 --> 02:02:00.918]  We're talking about... This is amazing!
[02:02:01.986 --> 02:02:10.437]  This is absolutely... Were you aware that in prisons they're now trying to block prisoners from getting into the law libraries and looking at things?
[02:02:11.038 --> 02:02:12.260]  I have heard about that, yes.
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:16.085]  I am not sure to what extent that's happening, but yes, I have heard of that.
[02:02:16.778 --> 02:02:17.499]  This is amazing.
[02:02:17.539 --> 02:02:18.780]  Sorry about these quick segments.
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:20.281]  A long segment coming up.
[02:02:20.321 --> 02:02:22.482]  Plenty of time to get into more of this.
[02:02:22.983 --> 02:02:24.144]  And then the Patriot Act.
[02:02:24.184 --> 02:02:26.986]  What they've been trying to do to the libraries.
[02:02:27.066 --> 02:02:28.887]  Trying to turn the librarians into spies.
[02:02:29.408 --> 02:02:32.190]  Then telling librarians they can't talk about what they've been told to do.
[02:02:32.210 --> 02:02:34.472]  The librarians have been standing up against that.
[02:02:35.012 --> 02:02:40.256]  We'll talk about it with the President, Carol Bray-Casillano, when we get back and give you their website.
[02:02:40.376 --> 02:02:40.997]  Please stay with us.
[02:02:46.295 --> 02:02:49.878]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[02:02:50.118 --> 02:02:51.540]  If so, hope has arrived.
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:53.481]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[02:02:53.742 --> 02:02:58.906]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[02:02:59.266 --> 02:03:03.750]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:12.718]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[02:03:13.198 --> 02:03:14.339]  Gum disease is serious.
[02:03:14.819 --> 02:03:18.560]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[02:03:18.841 --> 02:03:25.483]  With a regular program of oral hygiene, including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[02:03:25.824 --> 02:03:29.865]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[02:03:45.330 --> 02:03:48.832]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:49.072 --> 02:03:52.574]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:52.674 --> 02:03:56.617]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:56.837 --> 02:04:03.000]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:11.325]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.745 --> 02:04:17.070]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:17.230 --> 02:04:20.993]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.374 --> 02:04:23.235]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[02:04:23.275 --> 02:04:25.457]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:04:25.697 --> 02:04:30.642]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:04:30.682 --> 02:04:34.785]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-699-7000.

[02:04:37.449 --> 02:04:39.012]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:04:43.971 --> 02:04:45.452]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:45.672 --> 02:04:48.753]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:04:48.873 --> 02:04:52.775]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:04:52.835 --> 02:04:57.058]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:04:57.418 --> 02:05:01.180]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:03.201]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:05:03.321 --> 02:05:06.662]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:05:06.682 --> 02:05:07.783]  The medical bills!
[02:05:09.364 --> 02:05:11.386]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:05:11.546 --> 02:05:14.588]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:05:14.769 --> 02:05:17.631]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:05:18.112 --> 02:05:24.237]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:05:24.757 --> 02:05:28.559]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:05:28.959 --> 02:05:30.339]  Order your video today.
[02:05:30.659 --> 02:05:33.321]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[02:05:33.401 --> 02:05:37.422]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[02:05:38.303 --> 02:05:42.944]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:46.166 --> 02:05:51.748]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.797 --> 02:05:59.998]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:00.619 --> 02:06:02.920]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:06.022]  It's not about left and right, it's about right and wrong.
[02:06:06.062 --> 02:06:07.963]  We expose it all, my friends.
[02:06:09.144 --> 02:06:12.385]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:06:12.726 --> 02:06:14.227]  Coming to you from Austin, Texas.
[02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:20.910]  Ashcroft tells libraries to destroy citizen-friendly publications.
[02:06:20.970 --> 02:06:21.831]  That's the headline.
[02:06:23.726 --> 02:06:31.993]  Then they have the statement regarding the DOJ request for removal of government publications by depository libraries.
[02:06:33.914 --> 02:06:34.675]  And what was it?
[02:06:35.996 --> 02:06:38.538]  The Law on Asset Orbiter Seizure.
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:41.921]  The Congressional Reform of 2000.
[02:06:42.081 --> 02:06:45.384]  It was a very hard one.
[02:06:45.404 --> 02:06:48.627]  I mean, how many guests have we had on where they
[02:06:50.859 --> 02:06:53.360]  They go into a whole neighborhood, arrest everyone.
[02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:54.361]  Remember Julia, Texas?
[02:06:54.521 --> 02:06:55.942]  No drugs found, no paraphernalia.
[02:06:56.242 --> 02:06:58.323]  Black people being arrested by racist police.
[02:06:59.243 --> 02:07:01.284]  They're given 20 to 90 years in prison.
[02:07:01.304 --> 02:07:02.645]  Their homes, their cars are taken.
[02:07:02.685 --> 02:07:03.485]  No drugs, no nothing.
[02:07:04.626 --> 02:07:06.427]  Well, that's asset forfeiture seizure.
[02:07:06.587 --> 02:07:07.687]  God-like power.
[02:07:07.747 --> 02:07:10.029]  Well, this just restricted it a little bit.
[02:07:12.490 --> 02:07:14.871]  Where if they don't indict you or charge you, they have to give it back.
[02:07:15.756 --> 02:07:21.453]  Now, if people don't have this reform, aren't aware of it, they can just take everything you've got.
[02:07:21.473 --> 02:07:22.195]  You don't even know about it.
[02:07:22.839 --> 02:07:26.201]  They tried to make them take this away, take this out of the libraries.
[02:07:26.482 --> 02:07:35.428]  The libraries said, OK, we want to know why, with a FOIA request, a Freedom of Information Act request, and so Ashcroft backed off and said, OK, we're not going to do that.
[02:07:35.908 --> 02:07:40.911]  Joining us again is the President, Carol Bray-Casillano, of the American Library Association.
[02:07:41.452 --> 02:07:47.556]  And I know we have loaded phone lines from Pennsylvania and Illinois and Canada and New York and everywhere else, basically.
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:08:01.011]  But Carol, continuing with any other points you want to make on this subject and also your organization's website, but then I also want to get into the Patriot Act and some of the other things it's been doing to free speech and people's right to information.
[02:08:01.472 --> 02:08:02.433]  Sure, that's fine.
[02:08:03.033 --> 02:08:09.479]  As far as this issue with the Department of Justice and the removal of documents from the Federal Depository Libraries, I did want to mention that
[02:08:10.269 --> 02:08:19.878]  Interestingly enough, any agency that releases materials to the Depository Libraries is within its legal rights to request withdrawal of those materials.
[02:08:19.998 --> 02:08:24.622]  So, in that respect, the Department of Justice was within its legal rights.
[02:08:25.062 --> 02:08:34.490]  When we became concerned was because it was not really clear why these materials could not, would not be readily available to the public.
[02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:36.612]  You know, statutes, public law,
[02:08:37.196 --> 02:08:40.778]  There are other ways that we as librarians have access to public law.
[02:08:41.278 --> 02:08:48.281]  So it's not as if this was not already something that could be readily obtained in just about any library.
[02:08:48.762 --> 02:08:51.343]  So that was the reason for the FOIA request.
[02:08:52.223 --> 02:09:01.528]  Well they can claim that they've got laws, but just think of, I mean you're a librarian, you're the head of the organization, biggest organization in the country for libraries.
[02:09:01.888 --> 02:09:02.128]  Yes.
[02:09:02.368 --> 02:09:04.049]  I mean when we've got the government
[02:09:05.336 --> 02:09:11.703]  Trying to bar access for the public from public laws, we've got a serious problem.
[02:09:11.743 --> 02:09:17.368]  It shows a desire to restrict information that people can use to defend themselves.
[02:09:18.489 --> 02:09:21.913]  And for those that aren't aware of it, can you talk to the audience about
[02:09:23.078 --> 02:09:26.980]  What the Patriot Act has attempted to do with librarians in America?
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:27.741]  Sure.
[02:09:28.401 --> 02:09:39.207]  Section 215, which I believe I heard you refer to earlier, is the section that has vastly expanded the FBI's authority to search records of bookstores and libraries.
[02:09:39.547 --> 02:09:51.313]  And the FBI can request those records, for example, what someone has read at the library, if that's available, when someone viewed a computer and what they viewed on that computer.
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:10:00.885]  And the FBI is not required to prove that there is probable cause to believe that the person whose records are being sought has committed a crime.
[02:10:00.925 --> 02:10:07.029]  In other words, the FBI would have to come to the library with a court order or something.
[02:10:07.049 --> 02:10:08.250]  Yeah, that's the difference.
[02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:13.913]  They could always do this if they had a warrant listing the place to be searched, why particularly.
[02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:15.234]  It's called the Fourth Amendment.
[02:10:15.574 --> 02:10:18.156]  Now it's just blanket, you know, do what we say.
[02:10:18.696 --> 02:10:23.677]  Well, they still have to get a court order, but they do not have to show probable cause, as they used to in the past.
[02:10:23.717 --> 02:10:26.898]  But it's blanket orders, though, in some cases for whole regions.
[02:10:27.658 --> 02:10:43.921]  Yes, and actually, as a librarian, if I receive that kind of an order, I'm prohibited from revealing it to anyone, except perhaps my attorney, who would help me to produce those records.
[02:10:44.581 --> 02:10:46.242]  So that's really our concern, is that
[02:10:47.392 --> 02:10:53.594]  We don't really know when the FBI might come and look for materials that we have.
[02:10:54.275 --> 02:10:58.876]  And, of course, our big concern is protecting the privacy of the people who use our libraries.
[02:10:59.016 --> 02:11:02.958]  Well, yeah, and on top of this, it's not just violating the Fourth Amendment.
[02:11:03.918 --> 02:11:05.919]  Now it's violating the First Amendment.
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:11.261]  And in 215 and in 213, if folks go read it, in H.R.
[02:11:11.281 --> 02:11:11.881]  3162, passed October 27, 2001,
[02:11:17.173 --> 02:11:22.115]  When you go and look at that, it says they can break in your house, your business, the library, the bookstore.
[02:11:22.836 --> 02:11:23.796]  Come there secretly.
[02:11:23.876 --> 02:11:28.458]  If you catch them or if they just come there while you're there, then you can't tell anyone.
[02:11:28.638 --> 02:11:31.039]  And then later they said, OK, maybe you're a lawyer because of lawsuits.
[02:11:31.599 --> 02:11:35.281]  Then the ACLU, love them, hate them, folks.
[02:11:35.841 --> 02:11:39.683]  The ACLU, this was earlier this year, had a lawsuit going.
[02:11:40.845 --> 02:11:53.311]  Concerning this and other issues with the Justice Department, and the Justice Department declared that section and said you can't talk about your lawsuit against us because it's national security.
[02:11:53.351 --> 02:11:54.052]  Were you aware of that?
[02:11:54.812 --> 02:11:56.373]  Oh, I wasn't aware of that little wrinkle.
[02:11:56.433 --> 02:11:57.874]  No, that's interesting.
[02:11:58.714 --> 02:12:03.817]  I do know that the Department of Justice has in the past, well, first of all let me just say that
[02:12:04.976 --> 02:12:12.885]  Attorney General Ashcroft has said that they have not invoked the use of the Patriot Act in libraries, that the number of times it's been used is zero.
[02:12:13.266 --> 02:12:20.554]  But the interesting thing is that other Department of Justice spokespeople have called libraries a logical target of surveillance.
[02:12:21.013 --> 02:12:31.802]  And we know from our own research that at least, the FBI has been in libraries at least 50 times in recent months, but has not necessarily invoked the Patriot Act.
[02:12:31.943 --> 02:12:38.528]  Listen, I have talked to librarians on this show and in Austin who've been visited.
[02:12:38.588 --> 02:12:39.429]  Well, see, there you go.
[02:12:39.549 --> 02:12:42.412]  So, you know, how are they visiting?
[02:12:42.472 --> 02:12:45.995]  Are they not invoking the Patriot Act, or are they using national security letters
[02:12:46.434 --> 02:12:51.575]  Which is another way to go in and request information without even having to get a court order.
[02:12:51.615 --> 02:12:53.576]  Yeah, that's the blank check we were talking about.
[02:12:53.596 --> 02:12:54.396]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:12:54.556 --> 02:12:54.816]  Right.
[02:12:54.836 --> 02:12:56.417]  That's right.
[02:12:56.437 --> 02:12:57.737]  It's just mind-boggling.
[02:12:57.777 --> 02:13:14.942]  Now, there has been a lot of resistance to this, but I've noticed when you talk to the average Joe, you know, Joe Sixpack, Sally Soccer Mom, when you talk to them, Carol, they've heard about the libraries, because you guys have fussed about it, which is good, but they don't know that the bookstores are having this happen, too.
[02:13:16.451 --> 02:13:22.880]  That could very well be true because I don't believe, well I'm sure that bookstore owners are very concerned about this, I don't know that there has been as...
[02:13:25.366 --> 02:13:28.609]  organized a campaign to let people know about it.
[02:13:28.669 --> 02:13:35.014]  You know as librarians we have really spoken out quite a bit and I couldn't say exactly how much the booksellers have talked about this.
[02:13:35.595 --> 02:13:42.441]  Well I don't think the booksellers want people to know about this but it has been in a few news stories and it is covered in the subsection.
[02:13:42.842 --> 02:13:45.264]  What's the website for the organization?
[02:13:46.265 --> 02:13:49.668]  The American Library Association's website is www.ala.org
[02:13:51.878 --> 02:13:56.460]  And you can go to our site and easily find information about the Patriot Act.
[02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:58.520]  I think there's a link from our very first page.
[02:13:59.341 --> 02:14:04.162]  And we have just a ton of information about the Patriot Act on that site.
[02:14:04.923 --> 02:14:16.527]  Background information, information about comments from the Attorney General's Office on the Act, and research that has been done related to the Act in libraries.
[02:14:17.574 --> 02:14:20.815]  So, I would encourage people to go and take a look and really become informed.
[02:14:21.335 --> 02:14:24.776]  As librarians, that's our job, you know, to make sure that people have the information they need.
[02:14:25.136 --> 02:14:25.716]  Exactly!
[02:14:25.756 --> 02:14:30.717]  That way you can go read where Ashcroft says there's no Patriot Act 2 months after it's introduced.
[02:14:31.517 --> 02:14:33.198]  And then now they've tried to pass it.
[02:14:33.478 --> 02:14:35.618]  It's just amazing.
[02:14:35.998 --> 02:14:37.099]  Let's take some calls.
[02:14:37.399 --> 02:14:38.999]  Fred in Pennsylvania called earlier.
[02:14:39.039 --> 02:14:39.959]  He wanted to talk to you.
[02:14:39.979 --> 02:14:40.780]  We put him on hold.
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:43.360]  Fred, you have a question.
[02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:44.040]  You're on the air.
[02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:46.541]  You're the president of the American Library Association.
[02:14:47.228 --> 02:14:49.389]  Yes, a question and a comment.
[02:14:49.689 --> 02:15:03.775]  I wanted to say that I came across this manual for the libraries, for the software, for the catalog and the circulation.
[02:15:06.276 --> 02:15:14.840]  There's another way that the government could possibly get a hold of records having to do with circulation, and that is through
[02:15:16.358 --> 02:15:19.640]  The software that's written for the library systems.
[02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:25.603]  Right here, there's something called an information file that you can convert a patron file to.
[02:15:26.743 --> 02:15:33.846]  And it's supposed to cover all the information that the patron has.
[02:15:33.926 --> 02:15:41.009]  For example, the name, all the barcodes that are on your card, the card number,
[02:15:42.911 --> 02:15:54.994]  academic status of the patron, the student ID, driver's license number, social security number, telephone number, all kinds of things can float magically out of these databases.
[02:15:55.014 --> 02:15:56.414]  There's no security for them.
[02:15:56.474 --> 02:16:00.475]  Fred, now there's a move to put RFID chips in the books.
[02:16:00.856 --> 02:16:03.216]  Carol, can you comment on what he's saying?
[02:16:03.536 --> 02:16:05.117]  Yes, I'd like to do that.
[02:16:05.637 --> 02:16:10.798]  Basically, while it is true that libraries maintain some records on the people who use
[02:16:11.135 --> 02:16:11.415]  I think so.
[02:16:30.889 --> 02:16:46.356]  You have the option of setting it one way or the other, but, for example, I'm in El Paso, Texas, and in our library, we set it so that as soon as you return your book, the record that you've ever had that book goes away, because we feel so strongly about protecting the privacy of people who use our libraries.
[02:16:46.596 --> 02:16:50.778]  I hear you, but I do want to say that there are some exceptions to that.
[02:16:50.838 --> 02:16:55.620]  You've got... Isn't a member of the
[02:16:56.992 --> 02:17:06.556]  Of the Online Computer Library Center, a library that's a member, don't they have to forward the use records, the borrowing records of patrons?
[02:17:07.897 --> 02:17:10.918]  Um, I'm not familiar with, this is a particular library you're talking about?
[02:17:11.118 --> 02:17:14.400]  Yeah, OCLC is called the Online Computer Library Center.
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:22.463]  Now that is a, and there's another thing, Patriot 2 is an automatic information gathering system.
[02:17:22.483 --> 02:17:23.904]  First of all, I support you.
[02:17:24.562 --> 02:17:33.925]  A thousand percent, but I'm only saying that I think you have to start talking to people in lots of different areas that know lots of facts about this whole issue.
[02:17:34.045 --> 02:17:35.086]  Okay, well said, sir.
[02:17:35.106 --> 02:17:36.766]  We'll come back, take more calls for our guest.
[02:17:37.406 --> 02:17:41.408]  Again, she's the president of the American Library Association, Carol Bray-Casillano.
[02:17:41.688 --> 02:17:42.388]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:17:46.488 --> 02:17:48.089]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:17:48.229 --> 02:17:52.312]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:17:52.472 --> 02:17:55.354]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:17:55.434 --> 02:18:02.159]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:18:02.339 --> 02:18:05.361]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:18:05.542 --> 02:18:07.943]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:08.063 --> 02:18:15.949]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:18:16.049 --> 02:18:27.552]  Cappazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:18:27.692 --> 02:18:34.494]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:34.534 --> 02:18:34.794]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:34.834 --> 02:18:36.335]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:18:46.538 --> 02:18:47.839]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:54.145]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:54.345 --> 02:18:58.168]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:58.528 --> 02:19:00.410]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:19:00.470 --> 02:19:02.752]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:19:02.772 --> 02:19:09.678]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[02:19:09.838 --> 02:19:10.899]  We're good to go.
[02:19:27.892 --> 02:19:30.754]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:19:56.792 --> 02:20:06.463]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:20:07.364 --> 02:20:13.952]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[02:20:14.921 --> 02:20:23.763]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[02:20:24.363 --> 02:20:25.864]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:25.944 --> 02:20:26.184]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:26.204 --> 02:20:26.364]  Call now.
[02:20:26.384 --> 02:20:31.745]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:20:45.291 --> 02:20:46.312]  It's finally here.
[02:20:46.432 --> 02:20:47.453]  Spring has arrived.
[02:20:47.613 --> 02:20:50.576]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:20:50.816 --> 02:20:54.259]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:20:54.479 --> 02:21:02.587]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:21:02.887 --> 02:21:06.609]  With ARC's Heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:21:06.809 --> 02:21:11.872]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:21:12.132 --> 02:21:16.635]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:21:16.835 --> 02:21:20.878]  There's Heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:21:20.978 --> 02:21:28.102]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce, and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:21:28.402 --> 02:21:28.963]  Save money.
[02:21:29.183 --> 02:21:29.743]  Eat healthy.
[02:21:29.944 --> 02:21:33.867]  Grow your own delicious, secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[02:21:34.068 --> 02:21:35.589]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[02:21:35.609 --> 02:21:36.890]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[02:21:55.213 --> 02:21:57.154]  This is the stuff we're talking about.
[02:21:57.374 --> 02:21:58.374]  And it's systematic.
[02:21:58.434 --> 02:22:02.355]  It's going on at every level of society, but we've got to stand against it.
[02:22:02.455 --> 02:22:07.917]  Our guests have agreed to stay a little bit in the next segment so I can get to all these callers that are patiently holding.
[02:22:07.937 --> 02:22:18.499]  I'm talking to, again, the president of the American Library Association, Carol Bray Gaziano, and the website is ala.org.
[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:20.280]  We have the press release about
[02:22:21.823 --> 02:22:24.344]  Well, Lord Ashcroft not wanting you to have federal laws.
[02:22:24.424 --> 02:22:25.285]  Public federal laws.
[02:22:25.305 --> 02:22:27.666]  You just can't have those because you can't defend yourself.
[02:22:28.606 --> 02:22:29.747]  Let's go back to the call.
[02:22:29.787 --> 02:22:31.268]  Let's talk to Tim in Illinois.
[02:22:31.308 --> 02:22:32.428]  Tim, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:22:32.468 --> 02:22:32.749]  Go ahead.
[02:22:32.769 --> 02:22:34.189]  Hi, how are you doing?
[02:22:34.489 --> 02:22:35.210]  Good, Tim.
[02:22:35.410 --> 02:22:42.594]  In relation to your guest, Alex, I'd just like to thank her for standing up to this, and I will support her and the American Library Association in any way I can.
[02:22:42.614 --> 02:22:43.994]  Thank you.
[02:22:44.275 --> 02:22:50.858]  With all this going on, I'm surprised that a book by David Ray Griffin called The No Pearl Harbor has made it in the Borders Bookstores.
[02:22:52.814 --> 02:22:54.135]  You know, I've heard about that.
[02:22:54.195 --> 02:22:56.636]  It lays out 9-11 as your knowledge.
[02:22:56.897 --> 02:22:57.857]  It is unbelievable.
[02:22:58.217 --> 02:22:58.658]  Unbelievable.
[02:22:58.678 --> 02:23:05.321]  I urge you and your guests to get the word out about it, because unlike your stuff, this is in the mainstream, and I'm really surprised.
[02:23:05.361 --> 02:23:06.022]  It's one of the best.
[02:23:06.782 --> 02:23:08.823]  You know, I haven't read the book yet, but I'm going to get him on.
[02:23:08.883 --> 02:23:10.784]  What does the book say?
[02:23:10.925 --> 02:23:14.307]  It gets very much into detail about the towers collapsing.
[02:23:14.687 --> 02:23:18.109]  It talks about the Ellen Mariani lawsuit, the assassination of
[02:23:19.528 --> 02:23:22.190]  The North Alliance leader before September 11th.
[02:23:22.410 --> 02:23:24.712]  There's so much in there I can't remember half of it right now.
[02:23:24.732 --> 02:23:26.314]  I haven't finished even reading it yet.
[02:23:26.774 --> 02:23:29.016]  But it's just amazing detail.
[02:23:29.276 --> 02:23:30.097]  We're going to get him on.
[02:23:30.117 --> 02:23:30.897]  Thanks for the call.
[02:23:32.238 --> 02:23:34.260]  Let's talk to... Who's up next here, Stephanie?
[02:23:35.541 --> 02:23:36.662]  Andrea in Canada.
[02:23:36.682 --> 02:23:38.544]  Where are you calling us from in Canada, Andrea?
[02:23:38.744 --> 02:23:39.064]  Hi there.
[02:23:39.084 --> 02:23:40.765]  I'm calling you from Montreal, Quebec.
[02:23:41.106 --> 02:23:41.486]  Welcome.
[02:23:41.926 --> 02:23:42.387]  Thank you.
[02:23:43.027 --> 02:23:46.870]  Alex, I just recently joined your website on PrincePlanet.TV.
[02:23:47.071 --> 02:23:47.571]  Oh, thank you.
[02:23:48.147 --> 02:23:49.688]  And I'm amazed at what I'm reading.
[02:23:51.189 --> 02:23:56.091]  I wish that we had somebody like you down here doing the kind of work that you're doing.
[02:23:57.212 --> 02:24:04.195]  What I was wanting to ask you about is do you have more information on the concentration camps that are being set up in Canada?
[02:24:04.535 --> 02:24:07.196]  Because I've been surfing and trying to find information.
[02:24:07.296 --> 02:24:08.317]  I can't find anything.
[02:24:08.377 --> 02:24:10.318]  It's even hard to find food down here.
[02:24:11.355 --> 02:24:12.496]  Oh, you mean storable food?
[02:24:14.017 --> 02:24:14.497]  Well, let me know.
[02:24:14.517 --> 02:24:16.999]  They're building emergency FEMA centers all over the U.S.
[02:24:17.019 --> 02:24:20.862]  I don't know about Canada, but you can do a Google search on detention centers.
[02:24:21.082 --> 02:24:25.725]  I have, and it comes up with maybe two things, and there's almost nothing out there.
[02:24:25.885 --> 02:24:27.946]  Unfortunately, we're really taking calls for our guests.
[02:24:27.966 --> 02:24:29.087]  Do you have any comments to her?
[02:24:29.107 --> 02:24:34.771]  Just keep up the good work and stay strong, and don't let anybody intimidate you into fighting
[02:24:35.629 --> 02:24:35.949]  You know what?
[02:24:35.969 --> 02:24:36.470]  I'm going to do this.
[02:24:36.530 --> 02:24:39.292]  I'm going to put you on hold and I'll go back to you when our guest is gone.
[02:24:39.852 --> 02:24:40.192]  Okay?
[02:24:41.994 --> 02:24:43.294]  Who's up next after that, Stephanie?
[02:24:45.356 --> 02:24:45.836]  Okay.
[02:24:47.798 --> 02:24:48.758]  Brian in Oregon.
[02:24:48.798 --> 02:24:49.659]  Brian, you're on the air.
[02:24:49.719 --> 02:24:50.139]  Go ahead.
[02:24:52.321 --> 02:24:52.561]  Yes.
[02:24:53.322 --> 02:24:59.246]  I was just wondering if I could go to my local federal department and ask them about this.
[02:24:59.326 --> 02:25:02.028]  Hello?
[02:25:02.368 --> 02:25:03.068]  Yes, I'm here.
[02:25:03.108 --> 02:25:03.409]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:04.650 --> 02:25:05.050]  Could you hear me?
[02:25:05.618 --> 02:25:05.938]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:05.958 --> 02:25:06.659]  You're on the air.
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:08.922]  Did you hear my question?
[02:25:09.443 --> 02:25:09.903]  Yes, we did.
[02:25:09.923 --> 02:25:10.684]  Go ahead, Carol.
[02:25:11.145 --> 02:25:14.088]  Yes, you were asking if you could go to your local Federal Depository Library?
[02:25:14.108 --> 02:25:15.510]  Is that what you were asking about?
[02:25:15.550 --> 02:25:15.790]  Yes.
[02:25:16.210 --> 02:25:17.232]  I live in Oregon.
[02:25:17.592 --> 02:25:18.233]  You live in Oregon.
[02:25:18.313 --> 02:25:20.515]  Okay, there would be at least one in Oregon.
[02:25:20.535 --> 02:25:21.537]  There are probably several.
[02:25:21.577 --> 02:25:24.240]  These Federal Depository Libraries are found
[02:25:24.853 --> 02:25:25.654]  I don't know.
[02:25:43.095 --> 02:25:43.996]  To a link.
[02:25:44.036 --> 02:25:48.039]  And what I can also do is give the host of the show that information.
[02:25:48.059 --> 02:25:50.261]  We'll go back and research that and I can get that to you.
[02:25:50.321 --> 02:25:52.663]  What town are you near in Oregon or what town are you in?
[02:25:52.683 --> 02:25:53.724]  I'm in Portland, Oregon.
[02:25:53.764 --> 02:25:56.085]  I thought I'd research that while you were talking.
[02:25:56.145 --> 02:25:58.988]  I found there's one at Portland State University here at least.
[02:25:59.048 --> 02:25:59.568]  I'm not sure.
[02:25:59.588 --> 02:26:03.932]  Did they send a memo out to everybody about this?
[02:26:04.012 --> 02:26:05.233]  That's how they do it, yes.
[02:26:05.333 --> 02:26:06.293]  We receive
[02:26:07.581 --> 02:26:21.747]  We'll either get a memo, and there's a letter that comes with shipments that they receive of publications, and then there will also be usually something in what's called administrative notes, which is a regular newsletter that the Federal Depository Libraries get.
[02:26:22.047 --> 02:26:29.710]  Now, for those who just joined us, Ashcroft is trying to have libraries remove public federal laws, okay?
[02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:32.551]  I mean, you talk about 1984, folks, this is it.
[02:26:34.392 --> 02:26:35.072]  That's incredible.
[02:26:35.112 --> 02:26:36.893]  Anything else, Brian?
[02:26:37.722 --> 02:26:40.003]  Quick note on Senator Ridge.
[02:26:40.043 --> 02:26:47.064]  I believe his great-grandfather was responsible for deceiving the Cherokee Nation and helping them along the Trail of Tears.
[02:26:47.084 --> 02:26:47.665]  I'm not sure.
[02:26:48.065 --> 02:26:49.005]  It's Governor Ridge.
[02:26:51.386 --> 02:26:52.586]  Well, your cell phone's cut now.
[02:26:52.626 --> 02:27:00.148]  What we'll do is we'll break and come back and take more calls and for our guests, just a few more calls for our guests, then I'll get back into all the other news.
[02:27:01.408 --> 02:27:04.649]  Carol, is there anything else the feds are trying to do with the libraries right now?
[02:27:05.470 --> 02:27:13.251]  Well, we certainly have the ongoing issue of the Patriot Act, and we were talking about that just a little bit earlier, and that continues to be a concern.
[02:27:13.351 --> 02:27:26.654]  There is actually a petition effort right now to get signatures in support of legislation to amend Section 215 of the Patriot Act, so people can go to the website for more information about that.
[02:27:27.014 --> 02:27:29.634]  So that's at ALA.org?
[02:27:29.794 --> 02:27:30.354]  That's right.
[02:27:30.754 --> 02:27:32.275]  Folks should really sign that petition.
[02:27:32.295 --> 02:27:32.975]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.015 --> 02:27:33.975]  Final segment with our guest.
[02:27:36.352 --> 02:27:37.332]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.752 --> 02:27:39.373]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.393 --> 02:27:43.074]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.515 --> 02:27:53.996]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:54.416 --> 02:27:58.657]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:58.877 --> 02:28:05.839]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.299 --> 02:28:12.404]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:12.544 --> 02:28:13.805]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:14.105 --> 02:28:17.067]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:17.207 --> 02:28:19.149]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:19.549 --> 02:28:26.774]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:27.074 --> 02:28:30.457]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:28:30.877 --> 02:28:34.019]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[02:28:34.039 --> 02:28:34.119]  866-885-6625.
[02:28:34.139 --> 02:28:34.259]  866-885-6625.
[02:28:34.379 --> 02:28:35.319]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:35.339 --> 02:28:35.539]  Call today.
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:53.303]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:53.603 --> 02:29:04.507]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:29:04.767 --> 02:29:06.587]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:29:06.847 --> 02:29:10.168]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:10.508 --> 02:29:20.970]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:21.250 --> 02:29:21.750]  That's right!
[02:29:21.931 --> 02:29:29.032]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:29.332 --> 02:29:33.455]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[02:29:33.635 --> 02:29:38.079]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:38.139 --> 02:29:38.599]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.945 --> 02:29:47.467]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:29:47.627 --> 02:29:48.768]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:29:48.949 --> 02:29:52.352]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:29:52.473 --> 02:29:52.893]  Phenol!
[02:29:53.213 --> 02:30:00.301]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:30:00.862 --> 02:30:04.744]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:30:04.844 --> 02:30:05.284]  Fragrance?
[02:30:05.665 --> 02:30:10.447]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:30:10.547 --> 02:30:15.229]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[02:30:15.470 --> 02:30:17.951]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[02:30:18.271 --> 02:30:21.693]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:30:21.833 --> 02:30:25.394]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:30:25.595 --> 02:30:27.936]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:30:28.116 --> 02:30:28.996]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:29.116 --> 02:30:38.861]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Kalben Pure Soaps.

[02:30:54.841 --> 02:31:00.903]  They railed against the crowd, another ragtag band, declaring.
[02:31:04.724 --> 02:31:16.587]  They laid their bodies down, my friends, in a bloody war for liberty for their descendants.
[02:31:16.687 --> 02:31:19.088]  Thanks to the renegades, we're free today, my friends.
[02:31:20.914 --> 02:31:23.656]  America is America because we have our freedoms.
[02:31:24.116 --> 02:31:25.337]  That's why we've been different.
[02:31:25.637 --> 02:31:26.978]  Tyranny is the norm.
[02:31:28.238 --> 02:31:30.800]  And now you have this attempt to clamp down on information.
[02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:38.224]  We have the White House who's been caught editing transcripts, changing official transcripts of what the President has said on national TV.
[02:31:38.884 --> 02:31:41.626]  We have all of these attempts to manipulate information.
[02:31:43.197 --> 02:31:45.438]  And in a big way, they're doing that in our libraries.
[02:31:45.678 --> 02:31:50.039]  And something I've talked about with our guests during the break is this attempted chilling effect.
[02:31:50.059 --> 02:31:57.160]  We've had listeners who say, I'm not going to take certain magazines, or I'm not going to go to the library, or I'm not going to go online, because they're watching me.
[02:31:57.200 --> 02:31:59.661]  Hey, they're the bad guys, okay, when they do this.
[02:31:59.861 --> 02:32:01.601]  They're not protecting us from terrorism.
[02:32:02.061 --> 02:32:03.342]  They're trying to take our liberties.
[02:32:03.382 --> 02:32:04.662]  They're using this as a pretext.
[02:32:04.982 --> 02:32:06.082]  So we should stand up.
[02:32:06.162 --> 02:32:07.022]  We're the good guys.
[02:32:07.422 --> 02:32:09.783]  We should stand up and engage in our First Amendment.
[02:32:10.766 --> 02:32:11.867]  Do you have any comments, Carol?
[02:32:12.387 --> 02:32:13.488]  Yes, actually I do.
[02:32:13.588 --> 02:32:29.376]  I would say that, by all means, people should not hesitate to go to libraries, because librarians, number one, believe in freedom of information for all, and so we are doing everything we can to make information available and to protect the privacy of the people who use that information.
[02:32:29.536 --> 02:32:38.341]  So, I think that, and also the fact that, yes, we can say that the FBI has been in libraries, but it still is a very small percentage
[02:32:39.049 --> 02:32:42.772]  Related to how many libraries there are in our country.
[02:32:42.852 --> 02:32:47.595]  So, I think the last thing we should do is back away from getting the information that we need.
[02:32:47.755 --> 02:32:53.640]  And believe me, librarians are there doing everything we can to protect the privacy of the people who use our libraries.
[02:32:53.960 --> 02:33:02.166]  I gotta tell you, firefighters, librarians, I've talked about this before, these are some of the real public servants that are left.
[02:33:02.566 --> 02:33:06.709]  These are a few of the entities that don't treat us rudely, that don't treat us like scum.
[02:33:07.669 --> 02:33:14.531]  And we've got to keep our libraries and our firefighters independent and not under this umbrella of Homeland Security.
[02:33:15.231 --> 02:33:16.852]  It's disgusting to watch this happening.
[02:33:16.872 --> 02:33:19.972]  They're now turning firefighters into spies and law enforcement.
[02:33:20.653 --> 02:33:21.833]  It's horrible, folks.
[02:33:22.533 --> 02:33:26.974]  Just a few of the last bastions of public service being erased.
[02:33:27.634 --> 02:33:29.375]  Ron in New York, and then we'll talk to
[02:33:30.643 --> 02:33:36.044]  Darlene and Linda, and that's it for calls for our guests, but Ron in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:33:36.224 --> 02:33:39.145]  Alex, this directly relates to what you're talking about.
[02:33:39.185 --> 02:33:54.308]  Last night on the program, the American Center for Law and Justice, whose principal organization for protecting the rights of Christians, whose logo was, we are here to protect Christian and constitutional rights
[02:33:55.123 --> 02:33:59.485]  uh... whose head attorney is uh... and leading spokesperson is Jay Sekulow.
[02:33:59.505 --> 02:34:02.586]  Yeah, Jay, Jay, Jay Demonlow, yeah.
[02:34:02.646 --> 02:34:04.627]  Okay, he said this.
[02:34:04.727 --> 02:34:08.549]  We have been big proponents of the USA Patriot Act.
[02:34:08.909 --> 02:34:09.849]  We helped draft it.
[02:34:09.909 --> 02:34:10.809]  We helped get it.
[02:34:11.310 --> 02:34:12.150]  Now this is quoted.
[02:34:12.470 --> 02:34:14.111]  We helped get it through Congress.
[02:34:14.551 --> 02:34:16.232]  It has been serving the country well.
[02:34:17.372 --> 02:34:23.235]  Then he goes into several issues, but the library issue here, he says, quote, the issue which seems to
[02:34:24.699 --> 02:34:29.843]  Arouse the most concern is the sneak-and-peek delayed entry.
[02:34:29.883 --> 02:34:32.145]  You can do it for drug kingpins.
[02:34:32.685 --> 02:34:36.548]  You can do it certainly in the terrorism context.
[02:34:36.588 --> 02:34:40.591]  The library record is again a huge misstatement.
[02:34:41.067 --> 02:34:44.689]  It has to be someone already under investigation for terrorism.
[02:34:44.709 --> 02:34:55.336]  Yeah, that's not true, and again, you look at this, this is the type of spin we see out of these people, and it's just thoroughly disgusting.
[02:34:55.356 --> 02:34:59.339]  I mean, there are hundreds of cases of them using the Patriot Act against the general public.
[02:34:59.679 --> 02:35:08.365]  In non-terrorism related cases, let's get a comment from our guest, the president of the American Library Association, Carol Bray-Casillano.
[02:35:08.425 --> 02:35:08.685]  Carol?
[02:35:09.409 --> 02:35:21.832]  Yes, our understanding is that this law, and of course we've seen it happen, where the FBI can just request any records that they feel they want to request.
[02:35:21.932 --> 02:35:25.973]  There is no real delineation of what they can request versus what they can't.
[02:35:27.093 --> 02:35:30.994]  Also, as we were speaking earlier, they are not required to provide probable cause.
[02:35:31.615 --> 02:35:32.696]  Well, here's what he said also.
[02:35:47.967 --> 02:35:51.749]  And it's already used in investigation for drugs and money laundering.
[02:35:51.769 --> 02:35:55.010]  Yeah, we heard that, but listen... So why not use it for the war on drugs?
[02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:58.031]  Yeah, that's the same thing Bush says in his speeches and everybody else, but listen.
[02:35:58.452 --> 02:36:01.753]  The point here is, is the national security letters are blank checks.
[02:36:02.113 --> 02:36:05.495]  These searches are blank checks, and it's not... Go read the Patriot Act.
[02:36:05.975 --> 02:36:08.136]  Seculo is counting on you not reading it.
[02:36:08.176 --> 02:36:08.756]  Thanks for the call.
[02:36:09.999 --> 02:36:11.260]  Just amazing.
[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:17.163]  Let's talk to, up next here, let's talk to Darlene in Colorado.
[02:36:17.203 --> 02:36:18.904]  Darlene, go ahead.
[02:36:18.944 --> 02:36:19.324]  Good morning.
[02:36:19.424 --> 02:36:23.986]  I wanted to give a personal testimonial as to how important it is to preserve these documents for us to see.
[02:36:24.867 --> 02:36:35.892]  Seven years ago, we were looking for a federal depository that would actually have President Roosevelt's papers on the shelf, along with all the presidential papers, and every library we went to that was a partial depository
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:37.781]  Yes, I'm here and you raise a good point.
[02:36:37.821 --> 02:36:43.085]  Not every depository library maintains every document and that is because it's due to space considerations and other issues because
[02:36:59.245 --> 02:37:01.668]  Libraries are providing the space for federal documents.
[02:37:01.768 --> 02:37:03.069]  So, you know, you're right.
[02:37:03.369 --> 02:37:07.293]  There are 100% depository libraries that have everything.
[02:37:07.713 --> 02:37:13.459]  And then there are other libraries that just maintain a percentage of what the government puts out, which is an enormous amount of information.
[02:37:13.559 --> 02:37:21.547]  And again, for those that just joined us, Ashcroft is now trying to have public federal laws removed so you can't read them to defend yourself.
[02:37:22.279 --> 02:37:24.660]  Okay, that's the latest newsflash.
[02:37:25.301 --> 02:37:26.681]  Darlene, what else do you have for us?
[02:37:27.002 --> 02:37:37.507]  Well, I just wanted to add that in terms of being able to substantiate things that we hear and or are told, it is important that we're able to access these original documents.
[02:37:38.068 --> 02:37:38.668]  Absolutely.
[02:37:39.201 --> 02:37:44.963]  And I would say that any librarian would do his or her very best to make sure you had access to that material.
[02:37:45.043 --> 02:37:49.925]  If it wasn't available in, you know, a particular library would find out for you where it could be located.
[02:37:50.225 --> 02:37:51.065]  Okay, Darlene.
[02:37:51.085 --> 02:37:52.166]  Thank you.
[02:37:52.506 --> 02:37:53.606]  Darlene, thank you for the call.
[02:37:54.326 --> 02:37:56.727]  And, you know, I love my audience.
[02:37:56.787 --> 02:38:00.769]  People who go to libraries, people who search the internet, people who read books.
[02:38:00.789 --> 02:38:02.649]  You know, this is the old America.
[02:38:02.929 --> 02:38:04.430]  The America that made this country free.
[02:38:05.535 --> 02:38:06.155]  Absolutely.
[02:38:06.376 --> 02:38:06.876]  That's great.
[02:38:07.116 --> 02:38:13.000]  We love hearing about people who are reading and, you know, finding out for themselves about what's happening in our country.
[02:38:13.700 --> 02:38:14.361]  That's what we do.
[02:38:14.381 --> 02:38:19.824]  I mean, that's the subculture that, you know, this broadcast is for, and it's a subculture that's growing.
[02:38:20.285 --> 02:38:25.728]  I mean, I'm seeing a major awakening, people, you know, getting involved, trying to find out about their government.
[02:38:26.469 --> 02:38:31.492]  Are you seeing more interest in researching this type of genre, Carol?
[02:38:32.119 --> 02:38:36.323]  Well, I would have to say we're seeing an overall increase in use of libraries just in general.
[02:38:36.443 --> 02:38:39.125]  In the last decade, public library use has doubled.
[02:38:39.805 --> 02:38:53.937]  And certainly people research all kinds of things, and I can't tell you whether it's government information, but they're certainly aware, and they want to know more about what our government is doing, current events in the community, what local government is doing.
[02:38:54.017 --> 02:39:01.003]  So, yes, there's definitely an increase in library use and an increase in interest in just what's happening around us.
[02:39:01.383 --> 02:39:10.948]  But unfortunately it's a gulf, whereas half of America is getting dumber and doesn't know anything and doesn't know how many continents there are, can't find Iraq on a map.
[02:39:11.388 --> 02:39:18.771]  Then I'd say 20% though is more informed than ever, just incredibly informed and that percentage is growing, so that's exciting.
[02:39:18.831 --> 02:39:20.652]  Last call for our guest and we're going to let her go.
[02:39:20.672 --> 02:39:22.813]  Linda, where are you calling us from?
[02:39:22.833 --> 02:39:24.414]  Hi Alex, Virginia.
[02:39:24.894 --> 02:39:25.215]  Welcome.
[02:39:26.508 --> 02:39:28.609]  Okay, I have a question that happened.
[02:39:28.669 --> 02:39:33.790]  Well, the library I usually go to to use the internet, which I'm usually looking up.
[02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:35.230]  Here's the website, by the way.
[02:39:36.410 --> 02:39:43.652]  So, anyway, I felt very comfortable because all you do is go check internet and sit down and use the computer.
[02:39:44.292 --> 02:39:55.235]  Well, the last week I went to the library I used to go to in another county, and now they take your name, they go in and look at what you looked up,
[02:39:55.993 --> 02:39:56.833]  And write it down.
[02:39:56.893 --> 02:40:03.596]  And my question is, one question is, how long do they keep that record of what you looked up?
[02:40:03.836 --> 02:40:05.157]  Yeah, that's a very good question.
[02:40:05.197 --> 02:40:10.419]  And, you know, libraries should not keep records for any longer than they need them.
[02:40:10.439 --> 02:40:13.500]  And we try not to create or maintain any unnecessary records.
[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:17.382]  So, for example, in my library system, we keep those records.
[02:40:17.862 --> 02:40:22.724]  We will soon be shredding them every day because we really don't need that information for any reason.
[02:40:23.843 --> 02:40:35.491]  And I understand that's the practice of many libraries around the country, that every day we keep the statistics of how many people are using the computers, that's what we really want to know, and then we shred that information, because there's really no reason for us to be keeping it.
[02:40:35.511 --> 02:40:36.432]  Right?
[02:40:36.952 --> 02:40:43.017]  Yeah, I would lobby, you know, the feds and people are trying to tell the libraries to do this, and I would lobby to not have them do it.
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:45.601]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[02:40:46.081 --> 02:40:46.822]  Anything else, Linda?
[02:40:47.142 --> 02:40:49.564]  Yeah, what are the differences in the two libraries?
[02:40:49.684 --> 02:40:53.267]  I mean, is the other library going to start doing that, too?
[02:40:53.367 --> 02:40:55.849]  Okay, well, it's one county, one city, one state.
[02:40:55.889 --> 02:40:57.911]  I mean, what type of libraries are these?
[02:40:58.912 --> 02:41:01.174]  They're county libraries in different counties.
[02:41:01.774 --> 02:41:06.578]  Everybody has a different procedure, and there is no standard procedure for libraries, but I will just say that
[02:41:08.143 --> 02:41:13.189]  Well, it is standard practice for libraries to not maintain any unnecessary records.
[02:41:13.209 --> 02:41:18.956]  So I think you would find that the vast majority of libraries, public libraries, whether they're city or county or district libraries,
[02:41:19.355 --> 02:41:22.878]  Would not maintain records any longer than they needed them.
[02:41:23.098 --> 02:41:26.782]  So, you may want to bring that up with your library authorities there in your community.
[02:41:27.142 --> 02:41:28.263]  I do that, Linda.
[02:41:28.523 --> 02:41:29.124]  Thank you.
[02:41:29.284 --> 02:41:29.764]  Thank you.
[02:41:30.145 --> 02:41:33.848]  I want to thank you for spending 45 minutes with us.
[02:41:33.928 --> 02:41:38.692]  Again, the President, Carol Bray Castellano of the American Library Association.
[02:41:39.213 --> 02:41:41.775]  ALA.org, can't forget that address.
[02:41:42.135 --> 02:41:45.238]  Got information on a petition to throw out sections of the Patriot Act.
[02:41:46.018 --> 02:41:47.838]  Got information on the Patriot Act.
[02:41:48.279 --> 02:41:49.259]  Learn it for yourself.
[02:41:49.719 --> 02:41:50.899]  Find the source documents.
[02:41:51.239 --> 02:41:55.160]  And don't ever let Ashcroft start barring access to public laws.
[02:41:55.180 --> 02:41:56.460]  I mean, this is getting out of control.
[02:41:57.540 --> 02:41:58.600]  Carol, thanks for coming on.
[02:41:58.860 --> 02:41:59.581]  My great pleasure.
[02:41:59.601 --> 02:42:00.661]  I wish you all the best, Alex.
[02:42:00.681 --> 02:42:01.221]  Thank you.
[02:42:01.461 --> 02:42:02.301]  God bless and take care.
[02:42:03.401 --> 02:42:05.502]  Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:05.662 --> 02:42:07.882]  I mean, it just goes from bad to worse.
[02:42:08.082 --> 02:42:12.143]  But the Library Association said, okay, well, why do you want us to get rid of public laws?
[02:42:13.385 --> 02:42:16.226]  Why do you want us to cover up access to this to the people?
[02:42:16.266 --> 02:42:18.266]  Why do you want us to destroy it or ship it back to you?
[02:42:19.087 --> 02:42:19.867]  And they backed off.
[02:42:19.947 --> 02:42:25.328]  You see, government counts on the people not being informed.
[02:42:25.408 --> 02:42:35.151]  And you talk to somebody who doesn't know anything about their government, and to them it's like, I don't want to know about that, that's boring, I just know about football and baseball and, you know, and how to look cool and how to act cool.
[02:42:35.471 --> 02:42:38.672]  We've got to, number one, it's addictive to be informed.
[02:42:39.232 --> 02:42:41.833]  And we've just got to get people on that path, on that road,
[02:42:42.647 --> 02:42:44.111]  And a lot of good things can happen.
[02:42:44.131 --> 02:42:49.929]  I want to recap some top news stories and some other news I haven't covered yet, but let's go back to...
[02:42:51.472 --> 02:42:59.998]  Andrea, who called in from Canada, and she wants to know about camps, round-up centers in Canada.
[02:43:00.418 --> 02:43:05.622]  I don't know about Canada, my dear, but I do know if you do a Google search in the U.S.
[02:43:06.303 --> 02:43:14.928]  for detention centers, FEMA centers, I have video of them in the takeover, Senate hearings, video of it, with the Senate admitting it.
[02:43:15.309 --> 02:43:16.430]  I don't know about Canada, though.
[02:43:16.450 --> 02:43:16.790]  Go ahead.
[02:43:17.650 --> 02:43:23.093]  I mean, I found all the information on your site and on other different sites that are similar to yours.
[02:43:23.793 --> 02:43:34.419]  But I can't find anything here in Canada, but I know that the government is finding things, because like just this past year they tried to, they forced mergers of all of our small cities into one city.
[02:43:35.499 --> 02:43:38.301]  Yeah, that's the regionalization, yeah.
[02:43:38.421 --> 02:43:44.704]  Yeah, and then they rigged the demerger elections, I don't know how else to call it.
[02:43:46.772 --> 02:43:56.399]  They rigged it so that 35% of the population has to come out and vote and then it has to be like 70% of the 35% has to agree to demerge.
[02:43:56.879 --> 02:44:02.363]  So they're rigging everything up, but to find any information or to have anybody like you down here, we don't have that.
[02:44:03.444 --> 02:44:06.867]  And it's something that needs to be done because I see this happening.
[02:44:07.127 --> 02:44:10.229]  Are there 18 million people in Canada?
[02:44:12.291 --> 02:44:12.531]  Yes.
[02:44:13.171 --> 02:44:14.232]  Yeah, somewhere around there.
[02:44:16.247 --> 02:44:23.114]  Again, your population isn't even close to what Texas is, so the infrastructure isn't as big up there.
[02:44:23.654 --> 02:44:26.697]  They've got a lot of different police state functions in place.
[02:44:27.298 --> 02:44:30.301]  A lot of the similar things that are happening here are happening there.
[02:44:30.401 --> 02:44:38.429]  But our population is so dumbed down, so cowed, and so pumped up of the government stories that they put into the media and stuff, that they just don't see anything.
[02:44:40.948 --> 02:44:43.710]  Well, I mean, how big is your prison population in Canada?
[02:44:43.730 --> 02:44:44.951]  I mean, people look for camps.
[02:44:45.051 --> 02:44:47.692]  I mean, the prisons are the camps.
[02:44:48.153 --> 02:44:50.394]  All of our prisons are basically filled to overflowing.
[02:44:51.335 --> 02:44:52.415]  And so they're building more?
[02:44:53.556 --> 02:44:58.179]  No, they haven't been building more, at least not publicly.
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:06.985]  But I saw one site where it talked about how the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are being trained to be secret police, and they have lists of people that are
[02:45:07.577 --> 02:45:07.957]  Well, good luck.
[02:45:07.977 --> 02:45:10.178]  We outnumber these people thousands to one.
[02:45:10.238 --> 02:45:14.240]  And so if one percent of us stand up, it's over.
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:15.560]  Total destruction of the enemy.
[02:45:25.549 --> 02:45:27.770]  This whole thing is a giant bluff, okay?
[02:45:28.450 --> 02:45:36.412]  All the globalists can do is blow up cities or release smallpox, then pose as saviors and hope we're all fooled by it and go along with them.
[02:45:37.493 --> 02:45:39.093]  That's all the globalists can do.
[02:45:40.133 --> 02:45:41.794]  The bark is much bigger than the bite.
[02:45:44.054 --> 02:45:48.416]  It's like the MGM lion that roars, but it's a chihuahua roaring like that.
[02:45:48.456 --> 02:45:49.096]  It's an illusion.
[02:45:53.041 --> 02:45:54.762]  This whole thing is a paper tiger.
[02:45:54.822 --> 02:45:57.563]  This whole thing is a man behind the curtain.
[02:45:58.363 --> 02:45:59.124]  Oh, definite.
[02:45:59.184 --> 02:46:06.267]  But I mean, when they start to ration off the food, and when they start to do all these things, that won't be an illusion.
[02:46:06.467 --> 02:46:13.109]  That's why we've all got to be independent and self-sufficient.
[02:46:13.490 --> 02:46:14.390]  Oh, definitely.
[02:46:14.410 --> 02:46:16.191]  That's what the Book of Revelation talks about.
[02:46:16.231 --> 02:46:18.972]  As much as we're going to try to fight it, we also know that it's going to come about.
[02:46:20.103 --> 02:46:26.607]  You know, so there has to be means for people to defend themselves and to have their own food storage and their own water storage.
[02:46:26.867 --> 02:46:33.031]  And, you know, it's just like, I'm looking at this and I'm a single parent with three kids and it's like, okay, well, where do I start?
[02:46:33.072 --> 02:46:35.513]  Do I get the storable foods or do I buy attractive land?
[02:46:36.354 --> 02:46:37.294]  You know, how do I do this?
[02:46:37.314 --> 02:46:40.076]  You know, I've got my Berkey coming, but it hasn't arrived yet.
[02:46:41.737 --> 02:46:42.838]  When did you order a Berkey?
[02:46:43.445 --> 02:46:45.686]  Um, I actually found a source here in Canada.
[02:46:46.186 --> 02:46:47.506]  Oh, you ordered it from somebody else?
[02:46:47.766 --> 02:46:52.547]  Yeah, well I had... Because the shipping and the exchange rate from the U.S.
[02:46:52.587 --> 02:46:54.247]  to Canada is incredible.
[02:46:54.588 --> 02:46:55.368]  No, no, that's good.
[02:46:55.388 --> 02:46:59.109]  You know, the Berkey itself is made in England.
[02:46:59.129 --> 02:47:01.269]  The Berkey Light is what we promote.
[02:47:01.769 --> 02:47:05.470]  It's interesting because I found like, let's say, ten sites for the U.S.
[02:47:05.610 --> 02:47:09.871]  and there was only one place in Canada that I could find that was selling it through Canada.
[02:47:10.251 --> 02:47:10.871]  That's interesting.
[02:47:11.192 --> 02:47:11.652]  Oh, yeah.
[02:47:11.932 --> 02:47:12.452]  It's awful.
[02:47:12.472 --> 02:47:14.354]  The government doesn't allow certain books down here.
[02:47:14.834 --> 02:47:15.894]  Oh, believe me, I know.
[02:47:16.255 --> 02:47:16.975]  It's awful.
[02:47:17.415 --> 02:47:18.376]  Okay, good to hear from you.
[02:47:18.396 --> 02:47:19.216]  I appreciate the call.
[02:47:19.297 --> 02:47:20.297]  Okay.
[02:47:21.618 --> 02:47:28.082]  We're going to break, and I want to hit a few final news reports, and I also want to recap a few things.
[02:47:30.503 --> 02:47:32.765]  I just hope that all of you will get my videos.
[02:47:34.246 --> 02:47:35.786]  I mean, I've made ten great films.
[02:47:35.826 --> 02:47:36.807]  They're amazing videos.
[02:47:36.827 --> 02:47:37.828]  They're waking people up.
[02:47:37.848 --> 02:47:39.809]  They're unlocking minds like nothing else we've seen.
[02:47:40.846 --> 02:48:03.557]  And I carry a bunch of other wonderful videos by JPFO, the Second Amendment Group, Innocence Betrayed, about government killing 180 million people after taking their guns, and we got George Humphrey's new video, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, my 9-11 films, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and The Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, Matrix of Evil, Police State 3, Total Enslavement,
[02:48:04.921 --> 02:48:07.482]  The toll-free number to get the videos is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:48:07.502 --> 02:48:08.322]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:48:08.342 --> 02:48:13.604]  Big discounts when you get three or more of any of my films.
[02:48:13.624 --> 02:48:17.345]  Other specials on other books and videos we carry.
[02:48:17.365 --> 02:48:20.626]  So when you call the number, ask about specials.
[02:48:20.646 --> 02:48:21.686]  1-888-253-3139 or infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[02:48:35.228 --> 02:48:36.669]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:48:37.309 --> 02:48:38.229]  Stay with us again.
[02:48:38.249 --> 02:48:39.310]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:48:39.630 --> 02:48:44.872]  And don't forget as well about PrisonPlanet.tv, our all-new website.
[02:48:46.292 --> 02:48:50.634]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.814 --> 02:48:55.256]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.376 --> 02:48:59.777]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.797 --> 02:49:01.118]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.898 --> 02:49:02.679]  Panamers.
[02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:07.165]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:07.225 --> 02:49:14.173]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.273 --> 02:49:16.296]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.656 --> 02:49:27.080]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:32.662]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:49:47.688 --> 02:49:58.393]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:49:58.753 --> 02:50:03.275]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:50:03.355 --> 02:50:14.700]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:22.122]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:22.522 --> 02:50:24.663]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:50:25.163 --> 02:50:30.105]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.

[02:50:47.185 --> 02:50:47.646]  Thank you.
[02:51:02.503 --> 02:51:03.144]  We're good to go.

[02:51:52.292 --> 02:51:55.054]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.794 --> 02:51:59.778]  Welcome back, my friends.
[02:51:59.798 --> 02:52:13.068]  Arizona Police, by Face ID Technology, officials from Arizona Department of Public Safety, have signed a contract with ImageWare Systems Incorporated.
[02:52:13.949 --> 02:52:15.671]  Hey, Stephanie, I'm getting a horrible echo.
[02:52:15.691 --> 02:52:17.272]  I think you hit a button wrong there.
[02:52:18.602 --> 02:52:19.302]  Oh, that fixed it.
[02:52:19.362 --> 02:52:21.683]  Boy, I was... I could barely continue.
[02:52:22.203 --> 02:52:32.767]  Officials from the Arizona Department of Public Safety have signed a contract with Image Wear Systems Incorporated that will allow them to conduct facial recognition searches on driver's license images.
[02:52:32.807 --> 02:52:37.129]  See, they take the digital photos, then they put the scanners in the police cars.
[02:52:37.629 --> 02:52:39.189]  That's part of the federal ID plan.
[02:52:39.710 --> 02:52:45.832]  Got these photos we're going to post, if they haven't been already posted, I've told my webmaster too, of an Alabama football game with
[02:52:46.432 --> 02:52:48.853]  People who aren't even troops dressed up like troops.
[02:52:49.473 --> 02:52:51.593]  Really weird searching everybody.
[02:52:52.593 --> 02:52:59.515]  AP reports Pentagon looks to direct energy weapons like active denial microwave guns to give to the police departments.
[02:53:00.175 --> 02:53:03.256]  Secret Pentagon proposals from MSNBC.
[02:53:04.256 --> 02:53:09.497]  They wanted to attack South America and Asia after 9-11 to blame them with the attacks.
[02:53:11.097 --> 02:53:12.658]  There's no end to that.
[02:53:12.738 --> 02:53:14.038]  Also some of our top stories.
[02:53:15.109 --> 02:53:16.230]  This is the New York Times.
[02:53:16.290 --> 02:53:19.913]  Reports that led to terror alert were years old, officials say.
[02:53:21.274 --> 02:53:22.575]  Three and a half years old.
[02:53:22.916 --> 02:53:28.440]  I remember hearing about how CIA plans to attack the World Trade Center before that.
[02:53:28.500 --> 02:53:37.388]  And then it was, oh, they're going to attack the IMF and World Bank and the Federal Reserve and the Stock Exchange in New York.
[02:53:37.808 --> 02:53:39.209]  Turns out it's all fake as usual.
[02:53:39.810 --> 02:53:42.032]  Here's another one out of the Associated Press.
[02:53:42.714 --> 02:53:45.615]  Pre-911 acts led to alerts.
[02:53:47.036 --> 02:53:53.658]  Also, Bush again wants a huge domestic intelligent czar that will be outside of Congress's control.
[02:53:54.139 --> 02:54:04.303]  Meanwhile, on their economic announcements, the dollar plunged and oil prices rocketed to $44 a barrel, a new all-time global record.
[02:54:05.663 --> 02:54:10.065]  Meanwhile, everybody's being conditioned to see police in black uniforms and machine guns and to be searched.
[02:54:10.683 --> 02:54:15.565]  Other articles here all over the country of public demonstrations supporting Bush.
[02:54:16.026 --> 02:54:19.287]  If five people show up with signs that say regime change in D.C.
[02:54:19.347 --> 02:54:21.828]  or out with Bush, they are arrested.
[02:54:21.909 --> 02:54:23.109]  No protesting allowed.
[02:54:23.209 --> 02:54:23.829]  Period!
[02:54:25.430 --> 02:54:37.596]  Just incredible stuff that is happening all over the globe right now and there is no reason for any of us to be putting up with this.
[02:54:38.397 --> 02:54:39.077]  It is just so
[02:54:39.980 --> 02:54:47.386]  Classic, classical tyranny that we see developing and unfolding right now.
[02:54:47.426 --> 02:54:52.711]  But the good news is, if we stand up and say no, they're not going to be able to get away with it.
[02:54:54.392 --> 02:55:01.999]  And again, if you think you're going to serve this system out there, you think you're going to be part of this system, deep down you know this is all true, so you're deciding to join it.
[02:55:02.765 --> 02:55:10.729]  I want to assure you, you've just sold yourself, your family, your birthright, and future generations down the river of total dehumanization.
[02:55:11.229 --> 02:55:15.992]  The globalists are psychopathic criminals that must be resisted.
[02:55:16.052 --> 02:55:17.613]  They enjoy dumbing you down.
[02:55:17.873 --> 02:55:19.354]  They enjoy enslaving you.
[02:55:19.534 --> 02:55:20.934]  They don't have a conscience.
[02:55:21.275 --> 02:55:22.835]  They're psychopaths.
[02:55:23.276 --> 02:55:27.678]  And they con good people through fear to be part of this new world order.
[02:55:28.530 --> 02:55:38.012]  A New World Order they denied even existed, but now it's so big and so out in the open, they're having to admit it, but put their spin on it, that it's there to keep us safe from terrorists.
[02:55:38.812 --> 02:55:49.555]  So to all of our AM and FM affiliates, Shortwave, Internet, Satellite, to all the sponsors, to you, the listeners, and number one, to God, I want to just, I am thankful.
[02:55:50.504 --> 02:56:05.539]  That I am able to be in this fight, that I am able to stand up against the globe and listen to the best job I possibly can, and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your support and all the great things you've done and all the people you've woken up and how you've been in the arena.
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:08.062]  To all of you, thank you for being involved.
[02:56:08.362 --> 02:56:13.808]  If you weren't out there doing what you do in small ways every day, we would be in much worse shape today.
[02:56:14.622 --> 02:56:15.984]  Many hands make light work.
[02:56:16.404 --> 02:56:18.126]  We can defeat the New World Order.
[02:56:18.406 --> 02:56:20.768]  We will defeat the New World Order.
[02:56:20.989 --> 02:56:21.930]  We don't have a choice.
[02:56:21.990 --> 02:56:23.431]  We're inside this thing now.
[02:56:24.072 --> 02:56:29.477]  And it's a battle for survival of the human spirit against the devil and all his minions.
[02:56:29.798 --> 02:56:31.099]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:31.299 --> 02:56:32.440]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
