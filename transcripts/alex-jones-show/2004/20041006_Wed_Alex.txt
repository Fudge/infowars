[00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:06.465]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.126 --> 00:00:08.186]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:10.007]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:11.528]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:13.108]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:17.670]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:22.112]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:28.295]  It's already Wednesday, my friends.
[00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:30.636]  The sixth day of October 2004.
[00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:32.317]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:40.922]  Here's just a thumbnail sketch, a smattering, as they say, of what's coming up.
[00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:48.027]  McCain national ID card secretly passed Senate last Friday.
[00:00:49.428 --> 00:00:50.329]  Another article here.
[00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.191]  Officials warn of major flu shot shortages.
[00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:55.012]  Oh, because more of them were contaminated.
[00:00:55.552 --> 00:01:00.596]  I thought vaccines are always pure and delicious and good for us and the mercury is nutritious.
[00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:02.277]  Well, not according to this.
[00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:08.215]  And for those that just joined us, yes, nationally the government says mercury is now a nutritional item.
[00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:15.899]  Oil extends record run to $51.48 and they say no end in sight.
[00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:20.781]  With oil prices at the pump, gas prices exploding, we'll cover that.
[00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:25.724]  Protesters ransacked Bush-Cheney headquarters in Orlando, Florida.
[00:01:27.092 --> 00:01:31.154]  And at one of his headquarters in Tennessee, somebody shot the place up.
[00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.736]  So, this is getting to be out of control.
[00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:39.119]  And the Democrats really think Kerry's going to save them.
[00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.080]  I mean, how ridiculous does this get?
[00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:47.724]  And I just want to say that any of these type of activities are wrong and only aids the police state.
[00:01:48.084 --> 00:01:50.186]  So the people doing this need to be brought to justice.
[00:01:51.086 --> 00:01:53.828]  Also, McCain National ID
[00:01:55.268 --> 00:01:59.971]  Another article about that and the response that people are making to that.
[00:02:00.812 --> 00:02:03.133]  House crushes military draft bill.
[00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:12.900]  They went ahead and brought it up for a vote because of the incredible heat being brought on the presidency and on the Congress over this and they voted the thing down.
[00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:22.382]  But a bunch of the other bills are still introduced, and they still need more troops, and the Pentagon has said they want a new draft, and so you watch.
[00:02:22.422 --> 00:02:25.826]  This is just being done now, after the next convenient terror attack.
[00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:28.429]  They're going to bring their draft back, so we'll cover that article.
[00:02:29.895 --> 00:02:47.399]  In the second hour, we're going to talk about De Beers and the Oppenheimer family and one of the biggest monopolies on the planet over diamonds that are actually quite plentiful, but we'll show you how they've created artificial scarcity like they're going to do with water and oil and many other things.
[00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:51.452]  Also, big story here out of CNN.
[00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:54.894]  I've talked a lot about this in the past, but here it is mainstream news.
[00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:59.116]  Coroner removing man's organs was homicide.
[00:02:59.557 --> 00:03:00.697]  That's what the coroner says.
[00:03:01.578 --> 00:03:06.040]  They will kill you in many hospitals for your organs when you can be resuscitated or saved.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.481]  Just the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:12.003]  Hard to believe, but again, you want to just be blind and trust people.
[00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:13.724]  This is the type of stuff that happens.
[00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:15.465]  And also,
[00:03:17.262 --> 00:03:20.764]  Hate crimes built to muzzle Christians.
[00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:30.729]  This on the heels of the federally funded drills where they simulate homeschooler families viciously attacking public schools and murdering children en masse.
[00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:37.533]  Total fantasy, but they're superimposing it psychologically until there's a perception of homeschooling being terrorism.
[00:03:38.946 --> 00:03:45.732]  Actually listed as a terrorist activity in several public federal documents, but this integrates nicely with that.
[00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:49.316]  Hate crimes bill to muzzle Christians, all part of the new freedom.
[00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:51.458]  Also, Iran increases...
[00:03:52.592 --> 00:03:53.833]  Missile range!
[00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.776]  This is out of BBC.
[00:03:56.216 --> 00:03:59.179]  Russian school children to wear ruling party ID tags.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.742]  They have to wear Vladimir Putin ID tags now.
[00:04:01.802 --> 00:04:03.083]  It's a new Russian decree.
[00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:05.486]  Boy, that's freedom over there they've got.
[00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:09.750]  And our big ally, Bush, looked into his eyes and saw his soul.
[00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.572]  A soul he could trust.
[00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:12.413]  A soul of love.
[00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.260]  A kindred spirit, perhaps.
[00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:19.384]  Black Box Technology and Autos raises questions.
[00:04:19.464 --> 00:04:21.105]  We'll get to this article.
[00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:26.910]  Egyptian intellectual, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned 9-11.
[00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.031]  We'll go over that report.
[00:04:30.473 --> 00:04:33.835]  Also, lawmakers weigh foreign-born as president.
[00:04:34.116 --> 00:04:35.497]  AP, big push!
[00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:38.399]  They get Arnold in there as our savior.
[00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.903]  And inspectors conclude no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.127]  More on the latest ridiculous stage debate where they admitted over and over again it was staged.
[00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:50.369]  That came out several times.
[00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.513]  It's all coming up so stay with us.
[00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:54.213]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.251]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:06.891]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:08.812]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:14.253]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:19.114]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:05:19.414 --> 00:05:28.056]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:29.696]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:05:30.177 --> 00:05:33.918]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:05:34.198 --> 00:05:40.840]  With a regular program of oral hygiene, including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.222]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[00:07:00.266 --> 00:07:01.767]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:01.967 --> 00:07:05.048]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:05.188 --> 00:07:09.089]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.371]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:17.492]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:17.612 --> 00:07:19.433]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:20.013 --> 00:07:22.936]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:27.681]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:27.841 --> 00:07:30.884]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:31.064 --> 00:07:33.907]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.428 --> 00:07:40.534]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:41.054 --> 00:07:44.855]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:17.585]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.105 --> 00:08:22.248]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:30.175]  Again, my friends, it is Wednesday.
[00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:31.236]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:32.438 --> 00:08:45.049]  All the news we're about to cover is posted on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and now the revamped, upgraded InfoWars.net.
[00:08:45.089 --> 00:08:46.030]  Check it out today.
[00:08:47.071 --> 00:08:54.498]  Alright, McCain National ID secretly passed Senate on Friday, Liberty Think doing great research as usual.
[00:08:55.629 --> 00:09:16.240]  Senator John McCain's amendment 3807 to the 9-11 Commission's bill S-2845 was quietly passed late last Friday afternoon by unanimous consent after much of the Senate had already left for the weekend despite a promised debate on the amendment.
[00:09:18.095 --> 00:09:24.420]  Call Senator Collins' office and demand that she open McCain's amendment 3807 for further amendments.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:24.881]  The U.S.
[00:09:24.921 --> 00:09:26.682]  Senate switchboard number is 202-224-3121.
[00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:27.523]  Collins' number is 202-224-2523.
[00:09:27.563 --> 00:09:28.083]  And the fax is 202-224-2693.
[00:09:28.143 --> 00:09:30.805]  The 9-11 Police State Bill S-2845 could pass as early as tonight.
[00:09:30.885 --> 00:09:32.687]  If not then, a final vote is expected today.
[00:09:47.259 --> 00:10:04.302]  And it goes on, the version of 3807 passed is very similar to the Title 6 of the McCain-Lieberman Bill, S-2774, with slight changes that may or may not hamper the ability of Homeland Security to throw up checkpoints on highways.
[00:10:04.682 --> 00:10:13.884]  The process for standardizing state driver's licenses into a de facto national ID card is still in place, with additional provisions for a rule-making process.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:22.062]  And so they're now, again, they're busily passing large sections of it into the full bill.
[00:10:23.843 --> 00:10:44.251]  By the way, last night on my TV show, and this will be available today or tomorrow on PrisonPlanet.TV for the viewers there, I had on a special guest, and we showed video that he shot surreptitiously inside the Department of Transportation, where it shows the fields on their computers when they pull up citizens' data.
[00:10:44.858 --> 00:10:49.021]  And your social security number is now called the national ID number.
[00:10:50.201 --> 00:10:54.584]  And they're not supposed to talk about this, but this has now been in place for a year.
[00:10:55.144 --> 00:11:00.648]  And so what they've done is they've already brought in the standardized system from the federal government to the state governments.
[00:11:01.388 --> 00:11:06.851]  And now they just want to announce it and make it the law that you've got to have this card to have a job or do anything else.
[00:11:08.572 --> 00:11:12.935]  And so there you have it, my friends, right out in the open.
[00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:20.210]  And last night we showed the video of that computer screen with that field and that data.
[00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:23.474]  Here's an article out of Wired News.
[00:11:23.554 --> 00:11:25.276]  House Bill morphs the 9-11 advice.
[00:11:26.855 --> 00:11:27.415]  No, it doesn't.
[00:11:27.435 --> 00:11:28.156]  It just follows it.
[00:11:28.716 --> 00:11:42.682]  As the full Senate and House prepare to vote on competing versions of the 9-11 Commission's recommendations this week, all the legislation they tried to pass before 9-11 and have failed to pass since, most eyes are on how the government's intelligence services will be revamped.
[00:11:43.063 --> 00:11:52.587]  But civil liberties advocates, immigration groups, and some 9-11 Commission members are criticizing provisions in the House bill that they say go far beyond the Commission's recommendations.
[00:11:53.231 --> 00:12:01.334]  Now again, this national ID card is being pitched by lying neocons on talk radio and TV that it will stop the illegal alien invasion.
[00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:08.637]  The illegal aliens, the federal government accepts the matricula consular cards from Mexico and over 30 other countries.
[00:12:09.577 --> 00:12:12.338]  They do not face scan or thumb scan those coming into the U.S.
[00:12:12.358 --> 00:12:13.279]  from Latin America.
[00:12:13.319 --> 00:12:14.279]  They are given waivers.
[00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:15.399]  That is public.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.601]  This has nothing to do with stopping terrorism or immigration.
[00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:21.882]  It's about a new cashless society taxation grid.
[00:12:23.385 --> 00:12:25.086]  Let's go over Wired News.
[00:12:25.146 --> 00:12:34.774]  This is their summation of what is in the new Super Patriot Act slash National ID Card legislation known as the 9-11 Bills.
[00:12:36.095 --> 00:12:40.378]  Number one, create a de facto National Identification Card.
[00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:45.953]  And again, you already have that as your driver's license, but they're going to make you have it to have a job, everything else.
[00:12:46.414 --> 00:12:56.043]  Allow employers running a background check on employees to obtain records of arrests and detentions, not just convictions without limitation on republishing the information.
[00:12:56.583 --> 00:13:01.668]  So it doesn't matter if you have your record expunged or found not guilty, it's all going to be there.
[00:13:02.088 --> 00:13:04.771]  And that's the new way to even get into your juvenile records.
[00:13:05.513 --> 00:13:09.296]  Speed up the implementation of the newest airline passenger screening system.
[00:13:09.637 --> 00:13:10.417]  Secure flight.
[00:13:10.717 --> 00:13:13.159]  It's not CAP2 now, it's secure flight.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.721]  200,000 people are on the list.
[00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:18.884]  Prominent people, musicians, senators, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:19.825 --> 00:13:23.108]  By requiring congressional approval after it is deployed, not before.
[00:13:24.128 --> 00:13:34.237]  Require the State Department to study the feasibility of a worldwide database tracking American citizens and foreigners' lifetime travel history, including information on what countries Americans travel to.
[00:13:35.077 --> 00:13:41.001]  Require the State Department to intervene with foreign media outlets and foreign governments to influence media coverage.
[00:13:41.922 --> 00:13:42.042]  Oh!
[00:13:42.962 --> 00:13:45.064]  Part of the Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence.
[00:13:45.404 --> 00:13:53.069]  Make it easier for the government to deport immigrants to countries where they might be tortured or to countries to which an immigrant has no relationship.
[00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:55.991]  And by immigrant folks, Wire doesn't get it.
[00:13:56.892 --> 00:13:58.733]  They strip you of citizenship
[00:13:59.566 --> 00:14:06.050]  This is admitted, the White House own press releases, if they are bringing you into a terrorist investigation or you're a person of interest.
[00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:16.656]  And then you could be taken to Gitmo in Cuba or taken to Egypt or taken to Israel or taken to Jordan where they admit two and a half years ago they're torturing people.
[00:14:17.996 --> 00:14:20.478]  They torture us for them, the American people.
[00:14:21.658 --> 00:14:23.359]  Make it easier for the government to deport immigrants.
[00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:24.560]  Again, not immigrants folks.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.082]  Expand Patriot Act wiretap provisions and ban
[00:14:29.003 --> 00:14:36.826]  On material support to designated terrorist organizations, retroactively, they designate something a terrorist group and then claim you gave them some money or something.
[00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:41.288]  Make it tougher for illegal immigrants to get a hearing to protest deportation.
[00:14:41.728 --> 00:14:42.788]  Again, that's not true.
[00:14:42.828 --> 00:14:45.949]  That's for citizens once you're given an enemy combatant designation.
[00:14:46.369 --> 00:14:53.412]  Prevent states from issuing driver's licenses to undocumented aliens by changing what documents are acceptable at Canadian and Mexican borders.
[00:14:55.752 --> 00:15:05.505]  Again, the government, the federal and state, and over 800 cities and towns accept any type of consular material to get a driver's license to get a bank account.
[00:15:05.545 --> 00:15:06.406]  It's just not true.
[00:15:06.707 --> 00:15:09.230]  But they're going to sell it as if it's to stop the open borders.
[00:15:10.171 --> 00:15:11.233]  Senator Joe Lieberman
[00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:18.191]  Who co-authored the Senate's version of the bill has serious concerns about the House bill according to spokeswoman Leslie Phelps.
[00:15:18.571 --> 00:15:20.451]  Oh, just like you did when you voted for Patriot Act 1.
[00:15:21.152 --> 00:15:23.272]  See, they'll act like they're against it and then vote for it.
[00:15:23.612 --> 00:15:33.415]  The House bill includes several provisions regarding law enforcement and immigration that were not raised by the 9-11 Commission and that the Commission has explicitly asked to be removed, Phelps said.
[00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:38.787]  The Senate bill is also superior because it contains a number of civil liberties and privacy protections.
[00:15:38.827 --> 00:15:39.448]  That's not true.
[00:15:39.468 --> 00:15:42.830]  Including an independent civil liberties board, according to Phelps.
[00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:46.153]  And it goes on and on.
[00:15:48.174 --> 00:15:55.299]  Senator Lieberman again has been involved intimately in pushes for national ID cards, you name it.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.221]  But he's playing the part of the good cop here.
[00:15:58.527 --> 00:16:03.411]  John Thiry, a spokesman for Speaker of the House, and it has to defend the bill.
[00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:08.395]  We think that in this time of war on terror, we have a duty to make the country safer.
[00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:11.597]  And it just continues.
[00:16:11.977 --> 00:16:23.927]  So, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, racing ahead with Patriot Act 2.5, I guess you could call it, with this added national ID card.
[00:16:23.947 --> 00:16:25.548]  And then we've got people like David Dreyer,
[00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:32.817]  Congressmen introducing their own bills with even more draconian stuff in them.
[00:16:33.337 --> 00:16:35.540]  Isn't that just completely precious?
[00:16:36.181 --> 00:16:39.985]  Officials warn of major flu shot shortages.
[00:16:41.787 --> 00:16:44.009]  Associated Press reports global and U.S.
[00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:52.814]  health officials warned Tuesday of major flu shot shortages after British health officials abruptly pulled the license of the maker of half the U.S.
[00:16:52.854 --> 00:16:55.576]  vaccine's justice flu season was about to begin.
[00:16:55.616 --> 00:17:05.002]  The news means the United States will face a significant shortage, said Dr. Anthony Fasuke, the National Institutes of Health's infectious diseases chief.
[00:17:07.213 --> 00:17:10.836]  And again, every year there's a shortage and it's like the new Christmas toy.
[00:17:11.016 --> 00:17:11.957]  Everybody's got to get one.
[00:17:11.977 --> 00:17:12.677]  There's a shortage.
[00:17:12.717 --> 00:17:14.358]  We've got to go line up to get the shots.
[00:17:15.239 --> 00:17:22.404]  And this year, just like last year, they've told this particular place to shut down because they found live virus in it.
[00:17:22.945 --> 00:17:25.326]  Folks, everybody knows you take the flu shot, you get the flu.
[00:17:26.707 --> 00:17:32.892]  I mean, it's like the meningitis shot they started giving and now the deaths from it have increased 17 plus percent from those vaccinated.
[00:17:33.544 --> 00:17:42.175]  It's like Hepatitis B shot, you know, triples, almost quadruples, your chances of muscular sclerosis, and that's mainstream news.
[00:17:46.835 --> 00:17:48.776]  Now, this was a contaminated vaccine.
[00:17:49.316 --> 00:17:50.837]  Well, how can that be possible?
[00:17:50.917 --> 00:18:02.722]  Vaccines are always perfect and wonderful and you can't even sue vaccine makers in this country if you go through some federal vaccine damage board and some unelected group of pinhead judges.
[00:18:02.742 --> 00:18:08.925]  There's no juries involved and then they decide if you get anything after your child is brain damaged or died.
[00:18:10.626 --> 00:18:11.706]  So, that's the news there.
[00:18:12.006 --> 00:18:14.287]  Meanwhile, oil prices explode to $51.48
[00:18:16.943 --> 00:18:23.145]  And the gas prices at the pump went back up on average to over $2 a gallon.
[00:18:24.305 --> 00:18:25.866]  All part of the new freedom.
[00:18:25.926 --> 00:18:28.026]  And of course they claim it's all these supply problems.
[00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:31.427]  Why are all the oil companies posting record profits?
[00:18:31.787 --> 00:18:33.368]  And again, I'm not against profits.
[00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:41.950]  If it's not a monopolistic or a quasi-monopoly, an oligopoly, I was looking for that word.
[00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:53.623]  And that's why we'll be talking about De Beers and the Oppenheimer family in the next hour concerning diamonds, which you might not have known about, which is just the admitted facts.
[00:18:54.203 --> 00:18:57.844]  Protestors ransacked Bush-Cheney headquarters in Orlando, Florida.
[00:18:58.385 --> 00:19:03.847]  A group of protestors stormed and then ransacked a Bush-Cheney headquarters building in Orlando, Florida, Tuesday, according to local 6 News.
[00:19:05.327 --> 00:19:13.357]  They reported that several people from the group of 100 Orlando protesters faced possible assault charges after the group forced their way into the Republican headquarters office.
[00:19:13.797 --> 00:19:22.388]  While in the building, some of the protesters grew horns on a mustache on a poster of President Bush and poured piles of letters in the office according to the report.
[00:19:22.848 --> 00:19:24.871]  So see, they really ransacked it, I'd say.
[00:19:25.946 --> 00:19:27.107]  You know, this is serious.
[00:19:27.127 --> 00:19:29.427]  When you look at the headline, you think, oh, prosecute them.
[00:19:29.787 --> 00:19:34.069]  Then it turns out they just ran in and drew something on the wall and dumped some papers on the floor.
[00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:35.489]  They'll all be charged as terrorists.
[00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.230]  We told them to leave.
[00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.930]  They broke the law.
[00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.311]  Republican headquarters volunteer Mike Broome says.
[00:19:40.331 --> 00:19:42.132]  What you have is a big argument going on in there.
[00:19:42.552 --> 00:19:49.194]  But what should be prosecuted is whoever shot up a Bush campaign office in Tennessee yesterday.
[00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:54.237]  Alright, I haven't even scratched the surface on the really important news.

[00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:27.761]  There are no side effects.

[00:24:19.945 --> 00:24:22.266]  House crushes military draft bill.
[00:24:22.326 --> 00:24:23.567]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:24:24.988 --> 00:24:37.217]  The House of Representatives, yesterday, crushed a bill to reinstate the draft as Republicans accused Democrats of raising the specter of the compulsory military service to turn voters against President Bush's re-election bid.
[00:24:37.277 --> 00:24:40.880]  After a bitter debate on Bush's handling of Iraq, the House killed the bill
[00:24:42.685 --> 00:25:03.176]  402 to 2, as Republicans sought to stamp out rumors of an impending draft that have swept college campuses and the internet, worrying young people and parents across the country.
[00:25:05.794 --> 00:25:22.628]  And again, with the presidential and congressional elections less than a month away, the White House also worked to dampen draft rumors that Republicans said have been fueled by Democrats that threatened to veto the bill it called both unnecessary and counterproductive.
[00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:25.390]  Now let's talk about the facts.
[00:25:25.751 --> 00:25:34.738]  Senator Rangel, Congressman Rangel, years ago introduced the first big bill, but other bills have been introduced as well.
[00:25:35.641 --> 00:25:40.065]  Republican Senators have co-sponsored their own bills, brought forward their own bills.
[00:25:41.686 --> 00:25:48.351]  And they've reinstated the draft boards, increased Selective Services funding, they're running Selective Service ads now all over the country.
[00:25:48.952 --> 00:25:51.034]  The Pentagon has said they need a draft.
[00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:57.238]  And they're saying, if another big terror attack happens and we've got to invade other countries, we'll need a draft.
[00:25:57.819 --> 00:26:01.502]  Then everybody wakes up to it, gets upset, starts speaking out.
[00:26:02.983 --> 00:26:03.844]  And so then the
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.723]  Media comes out and then says, oh no, it's a conspiracy theory, there's no plan for a draft.
[00:26:09.763 --> 00:26:15.086]  But they brought it up to a vote yesterday and it was, I think that term is proper, it was crushed.
[00:26:15.966 --> 00:26:20.929]  So, look for the draft, as we've been saying all along, next year if we're going to get one.
[00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.630]  Are they moving to set one up?
[00:26:22.771 --> 00:26:23.611]  Absolutely yes.
[00:26:24.812 --> 00:26:25.572]  In the affirmative.
[00:26:26.093 --> 00:26:34.498]  And of course on top of that, we already have a draft, the stopgap measures, of people who've served three years, five years, ten years, in some cases twenty years,
[00:26:35.996 --> 00:26:38.457]  And they tell them, we're going to re-up you for another two years.
[00:26:39.417 --> 00:26:44.738]  They send people to Iraq and say, you're going to stay in Iraq another six months, then another six months, then another six months.
[00:26:45.378 --> 00:26:46.338]  This is incredible!
[00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:49.699]  And so this is the reality.
[00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:52.660]  Not the propaganda that we're getting.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.941]  We have a draft of people who have already served.
[00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:57.281]  There is a draft.
[00:26:59.048 --> 00:27:03.129]  And Kerry has craftily brought this up, but Kerry wants to expand the military.
[00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:05.490]  Kerry wants to double the special forces.
[00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.350]  Kerry wants to go after Iran now.
[00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:11.251]  I mean, frankly, I don't know why all these so-called liberals are loving Kerry.
[00:27:11.951 --> 00:27:15.672]  Listening to him and Edwards, it's like hearing somebody who wants more than Bush.
[00:27:17.073 --> 00:27:25.895]  Well, Bush did a bad job, but I want to invade more countries, and I want to put sanctions on more countries, and I want to increase the size of the military.
[00:27:27.407 --> 00:27:28.608]  Very, very serious.
[00:27:28.648 --> 00:27:32.831]  What do you think about that?
[00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:33.131]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:27:33.471 --> 00:27:35.993]  This is a big, big story, this next one.
[00:27:36.393 --> 00:27:41.056]  Coroner removing man's organs was homicide.
[00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:52.144]  Now my dad's a dentist and oral surgeon and he's worked in a lot of the hospitals rewiring people's jaws and so he knows the medical community.
[00:27:54.008 --> 00:27:59.329]  And he told me when I was 16, going to get my driver's license, he said, do not sign the organ donor card.
[00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:00.570]  I said, why?
[00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:13.773]  He said, because statistically you don't, if you ever get really hurt, statistically you don't get resuscitated or taken care of properly if you sign that because they get hundreds of thousands of dollars for your organs.
[00:28:14.494 --> 00:28:24.117]  Now it's, in some cases, half a million dollars for a set of healthy kidneys and liver and other tissues, lungs, hearts, all of it.
[00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:27.778]  And the doctors in the hospitals get a lot of that money.
[00:28:28.538 --> 00:28:30.839]  And whether it's subconscious or conscious, this happens.
[00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:34.380]  And then, I didn't believe my dad, but I didn't sign the organ donor card.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.921]  I mean, it was hard to believe that.
[00:28:35.961 --> 00:28:37.381]  Let's just put it to you that way.
[00:28:39.362 --> 00:28:40.142]  And then, just
[00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:46.150]  A couple years later, I'm sitting at my grandparents' house with my grandfather, watching 60 Minutes.
[00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.091]  I'd go over there and eat dinner most Sundays than lunch.
[00:28:48.831 --> 00:28:51.152]  60 Minutes with my now deceased grandfather here in Austin.
[00:28:52.392 --> 00:28:59.174]  And there was a 60 Minutes piece about the hospitals, one of them was in Chicago, where they would actually kill you for your organs.
[00:29:00.595 --> 00:29:01.675]  And it was all documented.
[00:29:02.255 --> 00:29:03.155]  So I was like, wow.
[00:29:03.295 --> 00:29:05.036]  Well now this is from CNN.
[00:29:05.796 --> 00:29:08.577]  Coroner removing man's organs was homicide.
[00:29:09.329 --> 00:29:20.035]  A Western Colorado coroner said Monday that two hospitals allowed vital organs to be removed from a man before they had proven he was brain dead and he declared the death a homicide.
[00:29:20.555 --> 00:29:22.036]  They've been doing this for decades.
[00:29:22.557 --> 00:29:25.798]  They actually keep you alive while they take your organs and they just turn you off.
[00:29:26.579 --> 00:29:31.922]  The cause of William Rardin's death was removal of his internal organs by an organ recovery team.
[00:29:34.463 --> 00:29:44.948]  Montrose County Coroner Mark Young said, he said he did not believe the case should be criminal matter, but that it should lead to a clarification of what the accepted standard is.
[00:29:45.828 --> 00:29:47.829]  Oh, so homicide shouldn't be a criminal matter?
[00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.810]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.931 --> 00:29:54.952]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.853 --> 00:29:58.534]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:06.656]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[00:30:06.936 --> 00:30:09.058]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:09.578 --> 00:30:14.202]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[00:30:14.502 --> 00:30:15.884]  It actually works.
[00:30:16.284 --> 00:30:19.687]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:30:19.747 --> 00:30:21.268]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:30:21.429 --> 00:30:23.630]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenated.
[00:30:24.051 --> 00:30:27.654]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[00:30:28.084 --> 00:30:28.705]  It truly works.
[00:30:29.065 --> 00:30:30.246]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:30:30.647 --> 00:30:36.393]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:36.453 --> 00:30:42.279]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:45.002]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[00:30:45.342 --> 00:30:46.402]  It's healthy for you, too.
[00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:47.583]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:30:47.603 --> 00:30:47.863]  1-800-622-FIN.

[00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:04.609]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:09.852]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:10.092 --> 00:31:14.453]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.754 --> 00:31:23.657]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:32.823]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:33.103 --> 00:31:39.848]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.308 --> 00:31:40.849]  What about you?

[00:33:04.735 --> 00:33:07.536]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.683 --> 00:33:24.312]  So, I was going over this article from CNN, where a western Colorado coroner said Monday that two hospitals allowed vital organs to be removed from a man before they had proven that he was brain-dead, and he declared the death a homicide.
[00:33:24.332 --> 00:33:27.515]  And the hospital's saying they've done nothing wrong.
[00:33:27.575 --> 00:33:27.815]  Why?
[00:33:28.495 --> 00:33:30.236]  Why are people alive routinely?
[00:33:30.296 --> 00:33:33.619]  That is, physically, their bodies are, and they go ahead and take their organs.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:35.440]  See, that's a
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:42.822]  That's an uncommon misunderstanding out there, is a lot of people think that you're dead.
[00:33:43.443 --> 00:33:46.304]  Your body's dead, your heart has stopped beating, they take your organs.
[00:33:46.845 --> 00:33:47.745]  That's not the case.
[00:33:47.945 --> 00:33:53.288]  And there's been a bunch of examples of where hospitals have been caught killing people that are just unconscious.
[00:33:54.809 --> 00:34:02.053]  Because there's so much money in it, ladies and gentlemen, and there's this rationale of, well, this one body will save five people.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:10.866]  And, uh, they removed his heart, his pancreas, his liver, his kidneys, uh, quite a haul.
[00:34:12.987 --> 00:34:17.911]  And, uh, the, again, the coroner is saying from medical records they killed this guy.
[00:34:18.937 --> 00:34:20.798]  Very, very serious.
[00:34:20.818 --> 00:34:26.100]  Now, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:34.643]  I also want to get into hate crimes bill, to muzzle Christians, Iran increases missile range, Russian school children to wear ruling party ID tags.
[00:34:35.463 --> 00:34:37.824]  That's right, with Vladimir Putin's little picture on them.
[00:34:37.844 --> 00:34:40.946]  I mean, how much more Orwellian does it get?
[00:34:41.026 --> 00:34:44.487]  Black boxes, technology, and autos raising questions.
[00:34:45.405 --> 00:34:49.646]  Egyptian intellectual, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Plan 9-11.
[00:34:50.026 --> 00:34:52.126]  This is another news headline we'll go over.
[00:34:53.826 --> 00:34:58.027]  But this is the next article I want to cover, and then we'll get to your calls and back in the news.
[00:34:59.587 --> 00:35:03.148]  Lawmakers weigh foreign-born as President.
[00:35:03.748 --> 00:35:04.668]  Associated Press.
[00:35:04.688 --> 00:35:12.550]  Now remember, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher introduced a bill so Arnold could be President just a few weeks ago, earlier this year.
[00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.110]  Orrin Hatch introduced it first in the Senate.
[00:35:16.218 --> 00:35:22.964]  And this is where they can line it up on the roster to where if they have a Constitutional Convention, this is what is on the plate.
[00:35:23.965 --> 00:35:35.635]  And during a CON-CON, Constitutional Convention, they can rewrite the whole Bill of Rights and Constitution, and they want to use something like a flag-burning amendment as the excuse to get this open, and then once it's open, they can do all this other stuff.
[00:35:36.395 --> 00:35:38.197]  They could care less about the flag, folks.
[00:35:38.537 --> 00:35:41.259]  It's a way to manipulate you into going along with the CON-CON.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.721]  It's not about Arnold!
[00:35:42.741 --> 00:35:44.122]  That's what they keep saying, lawmakers.
[00:35:44.927 --> 00:35:56.235]  Indicated, but the California Governor was certainly one of the rising stars of many minds as a Senate panel talked about amending the Constitution to let immigrants occupy the White House.
[00:35:56.436 --> 00:36:08.104]  Measures discussed by the Senators would remove the prohibition against foreign-born Presidents, opening the job to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, along with millions of others.
[00:36:08.424 --> 00:36:13.128]  This restriction has become an anachronism that is decidedly un-American.
[00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:20.982]  Uh, no, it's so they can't send spies over here, which the Austrians actually did in Poland over a hundred years ago.
[00:36:21.884 --> 00:36:22.625]  Oh, please.
[00:36:22.845 --> 00:36:24.467]  So, you see where this is going.
[00:36:25.108 --> 00:36:27.071]  Let Arnold be president or you're a racist.
[00:36:27.671 --> 00:36:38.440]  The restriction has become an anachronism that this decidedly un-American, said Orrin Hatch, Republican, Utah, Mr. National ID Card, Mr. Open Border, said, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:36:38.901 --> 00:36:49.510]  Hatch and other lawmakers barely mention the Austrian-born Schwarzenegger, a Republican, or the Canadian-born Granholm, a Democrat, but both have said they support changing the Constitution.
[00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:52.773]  With all that's going on, folks, this is so important to them.
[00:36:53.233 --> 00:36:54.174]  And Schwarzeneggers
[00:36:54.874 --> 00:36:58.237]  Starring Roald, the Republican National Convention left Republicans buzzing.
[00:36:59.498 --> 00:37:10.365]  This hearing would certainly not be complete if the name of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was not mentioned at least once, but of course he is just one famous example to Representative Dana Rohrbacher, Republican California.
[00:37:11.586 --> 00:37:20.332]  Hatch Rohrbacher, Representative John Conyers of Michigan, have proposed amending the Constitution to allow immigrants to run for President after being citizens for 20 years.
[00:37:20.953 --> 00:37:22.474]  Arnold's been a citizen for 21 years.
[00:37:25.032 --> 00:37:30.578]  A measure sponsored by Representative Vic Schneider, Democrat, Arkansas, would require 35 years.
[00:37:31.439 --> 00:37:35.524]  Schwarzenegger became a citizen in 83, Ranholm said.
[00:37:35.804 --> 00:37:38.126]  He also holds dual citizenship to Austria.
[00:37:40.108 --> 00:37:45.855]  It'd be like having an Israeli president, folks, or anybody else, but this is so dangerous.
[00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:53.793]  Amending the Constitution would require two-thirds majority votes in the House and Senate, then approval by three-fourths of the states.
[00:37:54.353 --> 00:38:05.497]  The Presidency was the one office the Founding Fathers barred to immigrants, apparently driven by concerns of foreign meddling or a resumption of monarchy, according to scholars who testified Tuesday.
[00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:08.705]  Those fears are outdated, they said.
[00:38:09.085 --> 00:38:14.566]  California's senior senator, Democrat Dianne Feinstein, was one of the lawmakers to express strong reservations.
[00:38:14.906 --> 00:38:19.107]  The requirement may not be a bad thing, it may be a strengthening thing, she said.
[00:38:19.127 --> 00:38:23.669]  The Democrats said later her concerns had nothing to do with Mr. Schwarzenegger.
[00:38:23.989 --> 00:38:24.909]  Sure, they don't.
[00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:35.232]  And again, he's open borders, anti-gun, pro-abortion, and he was worshipped at the Republican National Convention.
[00:38:37.166 --> 00:38:39.668]  And if they run him against anybody, he will win.
[00:38:39.688 --> 00:38:42.310]  They've got the voting machines, number one.
[00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.652]  Number two, people are in La La Land.
[00:38:44.672 --> 00:38:49.536]  The average person is in a fantasy world and really thinks that Arnold is this superhero.
[00:38:50.977 --> 00:38:54.119]  And he just has this winner persona.
[00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:55.400]  He just can't lose.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.061]  He can't be defeated.
[00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:59.703]  He can defeat eight foot tall aliens.
[00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:01.785]  He travels to foreign planets.
[00:39:02.405 --> 00:39:04.367]  He defeats hundreds of men with machine guns.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.582]  You know, it's this archetypal hero character.
[00:39:07.782 --> 00:39:08.923]  Folks, that's not real.
[00:39:10.203 --> 00:39:14.987]  I know most of you know that, but still subconsciously, a lot of people are not fully integrating that.
[00:39:15.927 --> 00:39:17.268]  And that's the plan, folks.
[00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:25.954]  I mean, they had movies back in the 80s and 90s where Schwarzenegger, in other movies he's not in, where he's the president after being the governor of California.
[00:39:29.316 --> 00:39:32.939]  And imagine him as the wartime president building this empire.
[00:39:32.979 --> 00:39:34.360]  I mean, it's just going to be disgusting.
[00:39:35.484 --> 00:39:37.065]  And I, for one, am not going to put up with it.
[00:39:37.366 --> 00:39:46.774]  The media may ignore and go, well, he said he admires Hitler, and yeah, he likes Kurt Voltheim, and yeah, he said he hates black people, but you know, he's good.
[00:39:47.475 --> 00:39:49.516]  Let's focus on some groping now.
[00:39:50.337 --> 00:39:51.278]  Of the Gropenführer.
[00:39:51.298 --> 00:39:53.120]  That's what a governor is called in Austria.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.341]  Gropenführer.
[00:39:54.981 --> 00:39:55.662]  Fits here, doesn't it?
[00:39:56.198 --> 00:39:57.599]  I don't want to spend all day on Arnold.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.003]  It just shows how completely bankrupt the Republicans are.
[00:40:01.483 --> 00:40:06.689]  Now these people driving around in cowboy hats with George W. stickers going, You're Debbie!
[00:40:07.129 --> 00:40:08.370]  So conservative!
[00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:08.911]  No he's not.
[00:40:09.632 --> 00:40:10.833]  And you're not conservative either.
[00:40:11.313 --> 00:40:12.014]  You're disgusting.
[00:40:12.995 --> 00:40:14.456]  Jim in Tennessee.
[00:40:14.496 --> 00:40:15.197]  You're on the air.
[00:40:15.257 --> 00:40:15.698]  Go ahead.
[00:40:15.718 --> 00:40:17.880]  I believe that's Jim in Texas, Al.
[00:40:18.576 --> 00:40:19.637]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[00:40:19.957 --> 00:40:20.938]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:40:21.218 --> 00:40:22.619]  Hey, you let us down.
[00:40:22.659 --> 00:40:25.200]  You didn't do your Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonation.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.201]  You do the best one.
[00:40:27.242 --> 00:40:30.324]  I don't know if I do the best one, but you're going to be my little slave.
[00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:32.145]  I'm an overturer.
[00:40:32.205 --> 00:40:33.726]  You're a little slave.
[00:40:33.746 --> 00:40:35.447]  I got two quick things.
[00:40:35.527 --> 00:40:36.828]  Ask me now, believe me later.
[00:40:36.928 --> 00:40:39.209]  I'm going to get your guns and get rid of your borders.
[00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.351]  And you're going to call me conservative because you're a little girly man.
[00:40:43.472 --> 00:40:43.952]  I'm sorry.
[00:40:44.193 --> 00:40:44.493]  Go ahead.
[00:40:45.094 --> 00:40:45.714]  That's not right.
[00:40:45.754 --> 00:40:46.215]  I loved it.
[00:40:46.475 --> 00:40:47.535]  Listen, I got two quick things.
[00:40:47.575 --> 00:40:50.077]  I got a call yesterday from Chuck Hopkins, Dukes.
[00:40:50.137 --> 00:40:50.977]  They was wanting money.
[00:40:51.578 --> 00:40:52.398]  And I let her talk.
[00:40:52.418 --> 00:40:53.519]  She said, he's for healthcare.
[00:40:53.559 --> 00:40:57.181]  He's for... Again, for folks who don't know, some local candidate called you.
[00:40:57.961 --> 00:40:58.141]  Right.
[00:40:58.541 --> 00:41:00.002]  And he wanted money for the economy.
[00:41:00.162 --> 00:41:00.943]  He's for the economy.
[00:41:00.963 --> 00:41:01.543]  And I stopped her.
[00:41:01.583 --> 00:41:02.704]  I said, what about open borders?
[00:41:02.764 --> 00:41:03.564]  And she said, huh?
[00:41:04.364 --> 00:41:05.585]  I said, they let the illegals in.
[00:41:05.925 --> 00:41:06.886]  They all get free healthcare.
[00:41:07.126 --> 00:41:08.066]  Destroys the economy.
[00:41:08.707 --> 00:41:09.727]  Huh?
[00:41:09.747 --> 00:41:14.310]  Yeah, that's just the biggest issue with voters in major polls that no one will discuss in Washington.
[00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:14.530]  Yeah.
[00:41:15.885 --> 00:41:16.825]  But there's one other thing.
[00:41:17.125 --> 00:41:18.646]  You had Paul Watson on the other day.
[00:41:18.666 --> 00:41:19.726]  He's always first class.
[00:41:20.307 --> 00:41:25.208]  And he did such an excellent comparison of the two Bush and Kerry platforms.
[00:41:25.568 --> 00:41:28.589]  I wonder if you could put that in writing on one of the websites.
[00:41:28.869 --> 00:41:29.830]  That was on the website.
[00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:30.690]  Where's it at?
[00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.371]  It's up there a few days ago.
[00:41:34.111 --> 00:41:38.533]  And how that works is there's a calendar there on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:41:39.548 --> 00:41:42.230]  And you just go click on the calendar, and it's like a newspaper.
[00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:50.074]  You know how when you get the newspaper and you lay the issues on top of each other, then a few days later you want to find an article, you just go back to the issue date, and you go and you flip to the paper.
[00:41:50.915 --> 00:41:54.697]  Thank you, because that'd be excellent ammunition against these people.
[00:41:54.737 --> 00:41:57.699]  Yeah, the 14 things that Bush and Kerry are identical on.
[00:41:58.439 --> 00:42:01.121]  You know, it's always, every four years, this is the election.
[00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:03.603]  If you vote wrong, the nation will implode.
[00:42:03.843 --> 00:42:05.324]  If you vote right, we'll do great.
[00:42:05.744 --> 00:42:06.584]  I get sick of hearing it.
[00:42:07.185 --> 00:42:07.565]  I hear you.
[00:42:07.585 --> 00:42:08.566]  Thanks for the call, Jim.
[00:42:09.694 --> 00:42:14.177]  Again, everybody focuses on the presidential election, who the big chief is going to be.
[00:42:14.578 --> 00:42:15.538]  They're just puppets.
[00:42:16.139 --> 00:42:19.822]  The real power is at the county, city, and state level.
[00:42:22.564 --> 00:42:28.768]  And the average person, you get what, 7-8% turnout for those elections and 55% for presidential elections?
[00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.551]  They're saying maybe 60% for this election?
[00:42:33.412 --> 00:42:36.254]  People need to be informed about what's happening locally.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.422]  I mean, take the average Austinite.
[00:42:40.462 --> 00:42:46.588]  They're against the fact that every major road and street is going to be a toll road, where we'll be tracked by these little chips they put in our cars.
[00:42:47.249 --> 00:42:48.951]  It's all admitted.
[00:42:49.051 --> 00:42:51.874]  $1,800 to $2,000 a year per car, publicly.
[00:42:53.476 --> 00:42:58.281]  Politicians being publicly paid off by the companies that are running all this, publicly.
[00:42:59.989 --> 00:43:01.189]  People don't get involved.
[00:43:01.229 --> 00:43:03.570]  You're all angry about it, but you're just going to put up with it.
[00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:04.591]  Have you called City Hall?
[00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:08.152]  Have you filed a lawsuit like we're working on?
[00:43:09.012 --> 00:43:13.333]  Have you informed yourself fully on the full ramifications?
[00:43:14.334 --> 00:43:16.054]  And the same thing goes for your town or city.
[00:43:17.095 --> 00:43:20.496]  Instead, it's all, you know, who won the debate last night?
[00:43:20.576 --> 00:43:21.876]  Edwards or Cheney?
[00:43:22.376 --> 00:43:23.817]  I'd have to say Cheney won the debate.
[00:43:24.817 --> 00:43:27.298]  And last week, I'd have to say Kerry won the debate.
[00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:30.031]  But it's like WWF wrestling, you know.
[00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:30.971]  Who won?
[00:43:31.031 --> 00:43:34.453]  Was it The Undertaker or The Rock?
[00:43:36.273 --> 00:43:39.575]  Or was it Hulk Hogan or Macho Man Randy Savage?
[00:43:39.675 --> 00:43:41.075]  It is not real, people.
[00:43:41.816 --> 00:43:48.959]  It is scripted, stylized, theatrical, simulated combat.
[00:43:50.299 --> 00:43:52.260]  It is nothing but a play.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.041]  It is not real.
[00:43:54.747 --> 00:43:56.488]  They're members of the same secret groups.
[00:43:56.888 --> 00:43:58.388]  They're related to each other.
[00:43:58.648 --> 00:44:00.589]  Their policies are almost identical.
[00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:02.270]  John in Texas.
[00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:02.870]  You're on the air.
[00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:03.530]  Thanks for holding.
[00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.650]  Hi Alex.
[00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.351]  Hello.
[00:44:06.071 --> 00:44:09.592]  I got a mutual friend up in Michigan.
[00:44:09.992 --> 00:44:13.853]  He's my friend, but he's a mutual friend that we used to work with up there.
[00:44:13.873 --> 00:44:15.134]  He's on the Michigan draft board.
[00:44:16.094 --> 00:44:18.455]  He's been saying all along that they're set up for a draft.
[00:44:18.831 --> 00:44:23.682]  In fact, they sent word out a few times to get ready and then they postponed it, but he said that everything's set up.
[00:44:23.762 --> 00:44:27.812]  All they have to do is basically push a button and everybody will have their draft notices in a couple weeks.
[00:44:28.453 --> 00:44:33.095]  Well, I have interviewed people on the draft boards, people who've resigned.
[00:44:33.275 --> 00:44:36.237]  They reconstituted the draft boards about six months ago.
[00:44:36.257 --> 00:44:42.600]  A year ago, they massively increased the funding for Selective Service, for advertisements, and for the offices.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.121]  They've introduced the bills.
[00:44:44.621 --> 00:44:48.203]  They have, quote, been studying it in these congressional hearings.
[00:44:48.843 --> 00:44:49.604]  They admit it.
[00:44:50.244 --> 00:44:58.008]  But we've always said, if there's going to be a draft, it's going to come after the election, after a convenient terror attack.
[00:44:58.599 --> 00:45:07.926]  And so now they bring it up to a vote yesterday to slam it back down and call it conspiracy theory so it's not a political issue in this campaign.
[00:45:09.867 --> 00:45:10.788]  But I mean, absolutely.
[00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:13.510]  I've got family and special forces, family who are officers.
[00:45:14.771 --> 00:45:17.933]  I know people on draft boards, people at Selective Service.
[00:45:17.993 --> 00:45:19.074]  I've got the news articles.
[00:45:19.455 --> 00:45:21.016]  They're gearing up for a draft.
[00:45:21.036 --> 00:45:21.336]  Go ahead.
[00:45:22.389 --> 00:45:26.431]  Another thing I want to talk about is, I've got a friend that's a Baptist minister I work with down here.
[00:45:26.451 --> 00:45:30.772]  He had a missionary come in that's a specialist on China.
[00:45:31.713 --> 00:45:43.597]  He said that the Chinese police, they go into those labor camps and if somebody's out making a quarter for goods produced, they execute them and dissect them down and steal their body parts on the world market.
[00:45:44.938 --> 00:45:49.640]  Well actually, just a few weeks ago, or actually a few months ago,
[00:45:50.638 --> 00:45:57.401]  There was a big TV report where they go into the factory and they go, well, how do you ensure quality of products?
[00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:58.741]  And they go, we just beat them or kill them.
[00:45:59.761 --> 00:46:01.582]  I mean, this is all caught on video.
[00:46:02.242 --> 00:46:12.546]  And China, in China, the children are sent at age five to dormitories where they live, most of them are, and they're brainwashed and wear uniforms and march around.
[00:46:12.606 --> 00:46:17.668]  And yeah, this is why the VCR costs $40 now.
[00:46:18.568 --> 00:46:20.289]  And it's killing our economy.
[00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:25.785]  And if we paid $60 for a VCR, we'd all have jobs to buy the VCR.
[00:46:26.906 --> 00:46:30.009]  Right, but we can't talk bad about our close friends and allies now, can we?
[00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:33.392]  Not according to Mr. Barnett in the new map.
[00:46:33.472 --> 00:46:35.875]  I mean, China's a wonderful playland of freedom.
[00:46:36.875 --> 00:46:40.199]  He chastised the Pentagon and said, they're our buddies and we need to work with them.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.981]  Yeah, this is just wonderful.
[00:46:43.041 --> 00:46:44.863]  I mean, look, we're becoming more like China.
[00:46:45.759 --> 00:46:46.641]  They're not reforming.
[00:46:46.721 --> 00:46:48.185]  Russia's getting worse than ever.
[00:46:48.205 --> 00:46:50.210]  And we're told they're our little buddies.
[00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:51.152]  It's disgusting.
[00:46:51.834 --> 00:46:52.676]  They're not joining us.
[00:46:52.696 --> 00:46:53.418]  We're joining them.
[00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:57.019]  Well, the globalists put them in power.
[00:46:57.059 --> 00:46:59.881]  The CIA now admits they put the Chinese Communists in power.
[00:47:00.281 --> 00:47:01.361]  They put Lenin into power.
[00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:02.422]  They put Hitler into power.
[00:47:02.882 --> 00:47:21.271]  They build up these systems to create a false bipolar world, to build up a police state here, while selling the weapons systems and economic systems, and propping up any command and control system available, and from time to time they'll then have a war with one of these things, one of these power structures that they've built up.
[00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:26.772]  That it always consolidates, always intensifies the power of the burgeoning world government.
[00:47:28.934 --> 00:47:29.394]  Yep.
[00:47:29.694 --> 00:47:30.614]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:47:31.115 --> 00:47:33.316]  John in Virginia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:47:33.616 --> 00:47:34.917]  Alex, another good program.
[00:47:35.217 --> 00:47:35.537]  Thank you.
[00:47:35.757 --> 00:47:38.599]  I had a couple things I wanted to talk to you about, just go over briefly.
[00:47:38.619 --> 00:47:48.884]  Yeah, China for the first time is moving troops into our hemisphere, and they're still our most favored base in trading partners, and they've said on a number of occasions they're preparing for a major war
[00:47:49.437 --> 00:47:50.538]  With the United States.
[00:47:50.638 --> 00:47:58.345]  So it seems odd we're sending our troops all over the world at the same time China's sending their troops into our back door.
[00:47:58.945 --> 00:48:01.007]  Well, you've got to learn the double thing.
[00:48:01.207 --> 00:48:01.828]  Absolutely.
[00:48:02.608 --> 00:48:03.689]  You've got to learn the double thing.
[00:48:03.809 --> 00:48:07.712]  Mercury is now nutritious, the federal government says, and we've plugged the reports here.
[00:48:08.853 --> 00:48:10.795]  Cameras in school bathrooms is freedom.
[00:48:10.835 --> 00:48:12.276]  Surveillance blimps over our cities.
[00:48:12.557 --> 00:48:13.998]  Scanning through our walls is good.
[00:48:15.067 --> 00:48:19.370]  China every week in their major magazines and newspapers says we're the enemy, they're going to nuke us and kill us.
[00:48:20.191 --> 00:48:25.434]  And so we've got to give them all the new technology and all the new computer technologies and move all our factories there.
[00:48:25.854 --> 00:48:31.538]  They've got a major military base in Freeport in the Bahamas with containers as far as the eye can see.
[00:48:31.558 --> 00:48:33.119]  They've been given the Panama Canal.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:34.460]  And they're not a threat.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:37.542]  It's Saddam Hussein because he had some oil and had 1950s weapons.
[00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:43.955]  And now our troops have got to be dead and dying there, and yes, this is what it's all about.
[00:48:44.356 --> 00:48:50.682]  Alex, I've got a friend, and when I say a friend, this is somebody I speak to three, four, five times a day, so he's a close friend.
[00:48:51.303 --> 00:49:01.234]  His brother-in-law is a colonel here in the National Guard here in Virginia, and was responsible for setting up draft boards in the counties here in Virginia.
[00:49:01.949 --> 00:49:06.530]  He says there's an active draft board in every county in the country.
[00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:08.711]  Well, that's been in the Associated Press.
[00:49:08.731 --> 00:49:10.572]  It was on the Pentagon's website.
[00:49:10.612 --> 00:49:12.372]  They took it down after they got caught doing it.
[00:49:13.132 --> 00:49:23.395]  And, no, the plan is, well, there was a lot of talk about a draft, and, gee, we didn't think it would happen, but, man, they nuked Chicago, and hundreds of thousands are dead and dying.
[00:49:23.435 --> 00:49:24.476]  We've got to have a draft.
[00:49:25.618 --> 00:49:36.726]  This gentleman has been stationed, they moved him down to a location down near Camp Lejeune about 30 days ago and he's been in intensive briefings the last 30 days.
[00:49:36.786 --> 00:49:46.013]  His instructions are this, he's going to be one of three people here in Virginia that's going to be a liaison between the federal agencies and the state and local law enforcement.
[00:49:46.073 --> 00:49:53.239]  His orders are this, he needs to be ready to institute martial law in the state here
[00:49:54.202 --> 00:49:58.326]  Between the dates of October the 1st and the end of January.
[00:49:58.426 --> 00:50:04.552]  Now I've gotten the documents here in Texas and it's in a TV report we did and it later showed up in the newspaper.
[00:50:04.852 --> 00:50:18.725]  You know, new mission for State Guard, a liaison between National Guard and the regular Army and the Pentagon and local governments and then the military will take over all the city halls and it'll be our new freedom and after all the terrorists hit us.
[00:50:18.985 --> 00:50:25.953]  Well, this is one of three men that certainly is in the know, and he's a brother-in-law of a very good friend of mine.
[00:50:26.013 --> 00:50:30.959]  Alex, I just wanted to tell you about a message that you get mentioned on a whole lot out there.
[00:50:30.979 --> 00:50:32.260]  Let me ask you a question first.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:32.480]  Sure.
[00:50:34.122 --> 00:50:37.123]  I mean, have you found out what this guy thinks about what he's being told to do?
[00:50:37.183 --> 00:50:37.683]  You know what?
[00:50:38.223 --> 00:50:44.925]  It's real interesting, because he's been told about the UN in here monitoring our elections, and he's basically there brainwashed.
[00:50:45.365 --> 00:50:57.689]  We've gotten him some tapes, and I'm going to be very... Well, right now, he's really... He's been shuttled away, and nobody can get in contact with him except his wife, so I can't get him anything that would be pertinent.
[00:50:57.769 --> 00:50:58.569]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.704 --> 00:51:06.068]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.248 --> 00:51:10.673]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.833 --> 00:51:15.217]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.257 --> 00:51:16.619]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.359 --> 00:51:18.340]  Panama!
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:22.603]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.663 --> 00:51:29.608]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.728 --> 00:51:31.790]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:42.518]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much much more.
[00:51:42.758 --> 00:51:43.899]  If you want to understand what the
[00:51:43.919 --> 00:51:44.159]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:14.042]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.383 --> 00:52:19.049]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.509 --> 00:52:26.231]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.631 --> 00:52:38.415]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.895 --> 00:52:43.340]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:53:02.236 --> 00:53:02.697]  Thank you.
[00:53:17.598 --> 00:53:18.198]  I think so.

[00:54:10.594 --> 00:54:11.795]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:54:14.075 --> 00:54:30.181]  Coming up in the next hour, we're going to be shifting gears and talking about monopolies, looking at one of the elite Illuminati families that controls all the diamonds, and then that mirrors what's happening with the oil, and with water, and other key things that are used in industry and in society.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:36.243]  And we'll also go to Alex and John and Don and Jason and everybody else.
[00:54:36.864 --> 00:54:38.665]  Just real quick, John in Virginia.
[00:54:40.218 --> 00:54:44.581]  This is the same story I see in the news, I've gotten from people personally, I've got the documents.
[00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:48.863]  They're geared up for total martial law on the election day.
[00:54:49.063 --> 00:54:50.164]  Yeah, they're geared up.
[00:54:50.564 --> 00:54:52.465]  I don't know if they're going to activate it.
[00:54:52.785 --> 00:54:59.788]  The point is they're training everybody internally that this is the way America operates and it's classical martial law.
[00:54:59.828 --> 00:55:00.229]  Go ahead.
[00:55:00.369 --> 00:55:02.010]  We'll sit back and see what happens, Alex.
[00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:06.592]  The only one really that knows where he is, his real location, is his wife.
[00:55:07.229 --> 00:55:10.032]  The immediate family is the only one that knows.
[00:55:10.272 --> 00:55:11.633]  He can't divulge where he's gone.
[00:55:12.133 --> 00:55:19.800]  I don't know what the significance of the end of January is, but until the end of January, he's going to be at this location.
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:27.206]  So I would say sometime between now and the end of January, we could end up in some pretty interesting times.
[00:55:28.015 --> 00:55:33.123]  Your answer to, was he aware of what's going on, my statement to that is probably not really.
[00:55:33.524 --> 00:55:38.532]  He's aware the UN is going to be monitoring the elections, but at that level a lot of these guys are brainwashed.
[00:55:38.572 --> 00:55:40.616]  Although a lot of them are really beginning because of you.
[00:55:41.454 --> 00:55:42.794]  And people getting your videos out.
[00:55:42.814 --> 00:55:44.775]  A lot of people are really starting to wake up.
[00:55:44.835 --> 00:55:45.956]  Well, because of everybody.
[00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:47.096]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:55:47.576 --> 00:55:48.696]  Alex, could I mention one thing?
[00:55:48.716 --> 00:55:49.557]  Yeah, we got a lot of callers here.
[00:55:49.577 --> 00:55:50.117]  Alright, I know.
[00:55:50.197 --> 00:55:51.177]  We got a message board.
[00:55:51.237 --> 00:55:52.638]  We talk about you on it all the time.
[00:55:52.658 --> 00:55:53.658]  I don't care if you talk about me.
[00:55:53.698 --> 00:55:54.438]  No, no, no.
[00:55:54.498 --> 00:55:54.979]  Good stuff.
[00:55:55.019 --> 00:55:55.839]  It's freedom underground.
[00:55:55.859 --> 00:55:58.580]  No, I know that, but I mean, it's not about me, John.
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.301]  I mean, you're welcome to plug your message board.
[00:56:02.321 --> 00:56:04.982]  You don't have to preface it with, you know, you're on the message board.
[00:56:05.461 --> 00:56:06.701]  I'm on board, man, because it's good.
[00:56:06.741 --> 00:56:09.862]  For all the Patriots out there, it's FreedomUnderground.org.
[00:56:09.882 --> 00:56:11.202]  We're talking about this stuff.
[00:56:11.262 --> 00:56:12.623]  It's getting the information out.
[00:56:12.783 --> 00:56:13.203]  Okay, good.
[00:56:13.483 --> 00:56:13.783]  Awesome.
[00:56:13.823 --> 00:56:14.563]  Good to hear from you.
[00:56:14.983 --> 00:56:16.264]  I'm glad you called, John.
[00:56:17.244 --> 00:56:18.944]  I don't have time to take more calls now.
[00:56:18.984 --> 00:56:19.465]  I'm sorry.
[00:56:20.225 --> 00:56:25.526]  We'll get to Alex and John and Don and Jason and everybody coming up.
[00:56:25.546 --> 00:56:27.767]  We do have a guest coming on as well.
[00:56:27.787 --> 00:56:32.968]  We'll probably get that guest on in the five after, so I'll have time to take a few more of these calls before we do that.
[00:56:34.767 --> 00:56:36.148]  Robert sounds frustrated with the callers.
[00:56:36.168 --> 00:56:37.730]  It's just that I want to get to everybody else.
[00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.031]  That's really it.
[00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:43.274]  But then I want to give each caller time to go over the information because it's all important.
[00:56:44.175 --> 00:56:58.327]  Before I end this hour here in a minute and a half, I do want to encourage you to visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or PrisonPlanet.tv and go to the secure online shopping cart.
[00:56:59.754 --> 00:57:01.195]  And to order my videos.
[00:57:01.336 --> 00:57:02.917]  To get them and to make copies of them.
[00:57:02.957 --> 00:57:07.220]  And to get them to opinion makers and public officials and the authorities.
[00:57:07.741 --> 00:57:09.963]  So they at least have a chance to know the truth.
[00:57:10.483 --> 00:57:12.044]  And a chance to see what they're a part of.
[00:57:12.104 --> 00:57:21.172]  I mean, you can get the films I made 3, 4, 5, 6 years ago and watch them and it's everything that's now come true and happened.
[00:57:21.672 --> 00:57:24.774]  Because I was just going off their own roadmaps, their own documents.
[00:57:26.516 --> 00:57:28.437]  You know, hand somebody a copy of Police State 2000.
[00:57:29.918 --> 00:57:31.239]  Or police state do the takeover.
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:34.142]  And say, okay, this was made three or four years ago.
[00:57:36.504 --> 00:57:37.545]  Look, it all came true.
[00:57:37.986 --> 00:57:39.087]  It's all what's public now.
[00:57:39.947 --> 00:57:43.490]  And now these are the conclusions that this guy makes and extrapolates.
[00:57:43.531 --> 00:57:45.252]  And look, that's what happened as well.
[00:57:45.672 --> 00:57:48.395]  So you better watch his latest videos and know what's coming in the future.
[00:57:48.455 --> 00:57:49.176]  We don't stop it.
[00:57:49.636 --> 00:57:50.517]  The end of America.
[00:57:51.286 --> 00:57:52.827]  You need to get my 9-11 films.
[00:57:52.847 --> 00:57:53.788]  That's number one.
[00:57:54.208 --> 00:58:06.856]  Exposing that the globalists were behind September 11th and how they use that as their touchstone, their benchmark, their foundation to build this whole new world order system in this police state.
[00:58:07.377 --> 00:58:13.601]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the safe secure online shopping cart or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:20.678 --> 00:58:23.039]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:23.059 --> 00:58:34.826]  Or you can watch all the videos and read my book and Paul Watson's book and watch the weekly TV reports and the audio interviews for 15 cents a day at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:58:35.506 --> 00:58:39.789]  Or again, call toll free to get the films 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:40.169 --> 00:58:42.570]  We'll start the second hour.
[00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:46.753]  We've only hit the tip of the iceberg on the news and a great guest and your call.
[00:58:46.773 --> 00:58:49.254]  So please stay the course as we defend the Republic.
[00:58:56.272 --> 00:58:57.693]  Hello!
[00:58:58.013 --> 00:58:58.673]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.313 --> 00:59:00.374]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.094 --> 00:59:02.174]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.834 --> 00:59:03.675]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.695 --> 00:59:05.315]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.335 --> 00:59:09.656]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.157 --> 00:59:14.238]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.847 --> 00:59:18.489]  Already into hour number two.
[00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:19.770]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:24.534]  Janine Roberts, Litter and Greed, is joining us.
[00:59:24.614 --> 00:59:30.499]  A book that the De Beers and the Oppenheimer family, the controllers of the diamond cartel, did not want published.
[00:59:31.119 --> 00:59:38.446]  Veteran investigative author Janine Roberts overcame numerous obstacles and dangers to bring us her findings.
[00:59:39.226 --> 00:59:42.029]  Did you know De Beers hides away rich diamond deposits?
[00:59:43.007 --> 00:59:50.613]  The White House was manipulated into buying millions of diamonds it did not need in order to support an African dictator and now must sell.
[00:59:51.593 --> 00:59:53.335]  Flawless diamonds are made by U.S.
[00:59:53.495 --> 00:59:56.817]  Navy from sewage gas in Washington, D.C.
[00:59:57.377 --> 00:59:59.459]  Litter and greed reveals everything and more.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:04.923]  The BBC did not have the guts to broadcast and the Doubleday was scared to print.
[01:00:05.766 --> 01:00:15.854]  So this is coming up, and with all this news, it's important to know who the global rulers are, and the Oppenheimers are one of the key families over this system.
[01:00:18.076 --> 01:00:24.461]  We've got a bunch of news on the police state, on the New World Order, on Patriot Act 2.5 and the National ID Card.
[01:00:25.382 --> 01:00:27.363]  We haven't even hit the tip of the iceberg, so stay with us.
[01:00:27.403 --> 01:00:30.266]  But right now, let's go to Alex in
[01:00:31.235 --> 01:00:31.796]  Florida.
[01:00:31.916 --> 01:00:32.816]  Alex, you're on the air.
[01:00:32.917 --> 01:00:33.437]  Go ahead.
[01:00:33.977 --> 01:00:34.398]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:34.538 --> 01:00:36.159]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:36.780]  Welcome.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:37.501]  Thanks.
[01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:42.285]  I was at the FDAA meetings back in November.
[01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:46.789]  Free Trade Area of the Americas, also known as the Pan-American Union.
[01:00:47.249 --> 01:00:47.529]  Correct.
[01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:57.218]  And the local news would show these images of all these riot cops cracking the skulls of these so-called dangerous anarchists while the
[01:00:57.659 --> 01:01:01.520]  Well, the local media would interview the mayor saying, oh, this is a model for homeland security.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:06.121]  Let's bring this to every single, you know, let's bring this to every single major city when we have events like this.
[01:01:06.141 --> 01:01:07.601]  You know, they want to make this the standard.
[01:01:07.721 --> 01:01:09.421]  You know, personally, that scares the heck out of me.
[01:01:10.162 --> 01:01:15.763]  Well, it's training us how not to protest, how not to demonstrate, because they'll hire a few provocateur thugs.
[01:01:16.603 --> 01:01:24.384]  Yeah, I definitely, I definitely believe that, you know, there are some people out there who are, who are hired, because, you know, they were just, their slogans, their shouting and stuff, they just weren't making any sense.
[01:01:24.404 --> 01:01:25.425]  They tried to question them on it.
[01:01:25.445 --> 01:01:27.445]  They, you know, they'd get mad at you and walk away.
[01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:36.908]  And what also I noticed was that the police were pretty much test marketing taser guns.
[01:01:37.697 --> 01:01:43.299]  And right after these events, all the local cops on the streets pretty much started having these pacer guns now.
[01:01:43.319 --> 01:01:50.862]  And what they are, they're... Well, that's a non-lethal weapon, or sometimes kills you, that trains them to go ahead and engage you or attack you.
[01:01:50.882 --> 01:01:57.384]  It's a training aid, like you train a puppy German Shepherd attack dog on dummies first.
[01:01:57.784 --> 01:02:03.386]  This is just training the news and the public to accept the public being shot at for no reason.
[01:02:04.273 --> 01:02:08.337]  Right, and they're much more liberal with the use of these because they're so-called non-lethal.
[01:02:08.477 --> 01:02:10.199]  Well, you know, it's like the pepper spray now.
[01:02:10.219 --> 01:02:13.181]  Now you talk back or ask a question, they spray it in your face.
[01:02:14.323 --> 01:02:17.786]  I was also at the Miami Arena during the debate.
[01:02:17.926 --> 01:02:26.294]  They were having a debate rally there for John Kerry, where we'd watch the debate on the Miami Arena floor, which was very appropriate considering that's where the WWF has their events.
[01:02:27.114 --> 01:02:27.415]  Yes.
[01:02:28.408 --> 01:02:49.282]  And after Kerry was done giving the speech over at U.M., he went over to the Miami Arena to give a speech where he didn't really say much, but he was really good at rallying the crowd, and people were chanting, Kerry, Kerry, and no one was really like, no one had realized, he just said Iran had nuclear weapons, and he named out countries on the project.
[01:02:49.342 --> 01:02:53.705]  Yeah, nobody understood that he was like, I want a bigger military to attack more countries!
[01:02:53.765 --> 01:02:54.265]  Right, right.
[01:02:54.385 --> 01:02:55.266]  Oh, how liberal!
[01:02:56.474 --> 01:03:03.098]  Yeah, and when I bring up Skull and Bones to the people standing around me, the usual response I get is, like, oh, that's just a frat.
[01:03:03.118 --> 01:03:04.259]  Or, you know, there's a bunch of kids.
[01:03:04.279 --> 01:03:05.620]  There's no conspiracy in that.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.782]  And five years ago it didn't exist, but now, oh, it's just some fun.
[01:03:10.182 --> 01:03:10.422]  Yeah.
[01:03:11.123 --> 01:03:18.467]  And, you know, at the end of the event, you know, everyone felt like they made a difference, and they go home, and at the end of the day, they're still voting for whoever Diebold will allow them to.
[01:03:19.182 --> 01:03:20.023]  The touchscreen voting system.

[01:06:54.784 --> 01:07:00.809]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.429 --> 01:07:04.471]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.736 --> 01:07:15.960]  When I was a little boy, I had family who were in the diamond business.
[01:07:17.088 --> 01:07:23.850]  They did currying work for diamonds that were coming into the country out of Africa, selling them.
[01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:26.011]  I remember seeing my dad on the news.
[01:07:26.111 --> 01:07:27.631]  He was just a low-level functionary.
[01:07:28.072 --> 01:07:32.693]  When they brought some giant South African diamond to Dallas, they had the guys with the shotguns guarding it.
[01:07:33.313 --> 01:07:38.255]  And my dad told me, he said, they've got, you know, over in Europe, just huge bins of diamonds.
[01:07:38.695 --> 01:07:42.836]  Diamonds are actually extremely common, and they're almost semi-precious.
[01:07:43.617 --> 01:07:44.697]  They're not really precious.
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:48.523]  And we're talking about naturally formed diamonds.
[01:07:48.563 --> 01:07:52.507]  And he talked about the Oppenheimer family and how it was all a staged deal.
[01:07:53.909 --> 01:07:57.853]  And then they had a PBS documentary a few years ago where they admitted it was all a big monopoly.
[01:07:57.893 --> 01:08:01.577]  And then there was an article in the New Yorker magazine
[01:08:03.336 --> 01:08:26.527]  I guess three or four years ago that I read on air where they just bragged that, well, the Oppenheimers run the De Beers cartel and they send in mercenary troops and helicopters and tanks and slaughter people who try to dig diamonds up with themselves and sell them because even a small trickle of diamonds, quote, conflict diamonds, evil terrorist diamonds, destabilizes their monopoly.
[01:08:28.038 --> 01:08:32.502]  And so they just, and they bragged in the article, we're going to label people that sell diamonds as terrorists.
[01:08:32.622 --> 01:08:33.283]  This was before 9-11.
[01:08:33.303 --> 01:08:36.585]  So I guess it was over four years ago.
[01:08:36.665 --> 01:08:37.606]  Time really flies.
[01:08:38.327 --> 01:08:41.129]  And our guest joins us from England via cell phone.
[01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:43.431]  We're going to try to get with a landline with her in the next segment.
[01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:55.261]  A major monopoly expose and work on corporate ethics, Glitter and Greed, is a book that the Beers and the Oppenheimer family, the controllers of the diamond cartel, do not want published.
[01:08:56.007 --> 01:09:00.129]  We're going to go over that with Janine Roberts.
[01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:02.650]  It's great to have you on the broadcast with us.
[01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:04.630]  Hi, it's good to be here.
[01:09:05.251 --> 01:09:05.691]  You bet.
[01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:16.875]  Just give us a thumbnail sketch for those who don't understand how the Oppenheimers got their monopoly, how the cartel works, what's really going on, and what your book covers.
[01:09:18.216 --> 01:09:25.819]  Well, when diamonds were found in South Africa 100 years ago, the rich merchants of Europe panicked.
[01:09:26.164 --> 01:09:32.787]  Because they had all these really expensive diamonds they got from India and diamonds were literally found sparkling in the moonlight.
[01:09:33.727 --> 01:09:50.354]  They had African captives crawl over the sand picking up diamonds by moonlight with tin cans strung around their necks and drop the diamonds in the tin cans and they had gags on their mouth to make sure they wouldn't swallow any diamonds and sort of steal them that way.
[01:09:51.594 --> 01:09:53.335]  Well now they x-ray them after work.
[01:09:54.685 --> 01:09:56.066]  They x-ray them after work.
[01:09:56.286 --> 01:10:02.548]  Except I found out that some people give whole body x-rays every day at the diamond mines.
[01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:04.629]  Which is very hazardous to health.
[01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:12.352]  And an operative that actually had done this for De Beers told me that he couldn't report this.
[01:10:12.413 --> 01:10:15.694]  He had to hide the records of what they were doing.
[01:10:16.194 --> 01:10:19.776]  Because obviously they're endangering the health of that miner by x-raying them every day.
[01:10:21.456 --> 01:10:22.957]  So it wasn't recorded that he was doing that.
[01:10:24.535 --> 01:10:28.758]  Um, they don't, you know, they don't have people calling by moonlight anymore.
[01:10:29.599 --> 01:10:31.940]  But I got smuggled inside the diamond mines.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:36.443]  I've been inside De Beers diamond mines, you know, the giant mines of Southern Africa and Namibia.
[01:10:38.104 --> 01:10:43.008]  And I found, like, all the families, their wives and kids, waiting outside the mining town.
[01:10:43.308 --> 01:10:45.289]  Now this is a mining town run by De Beers.
[01:10:45.329 --> 01:10:50.092]  It's got a church, it's a regular town, it's got schools, stores, a lot.
[01:10:51.333 --> 01:10:52.574]  But the families weren't allowed in.
[01:10:53.161 --> 01:10:54.821]  Wives and kids weren't allowed into the town.
[01:10:54.861 --> 01:10:57.282]  Now all the white miners have got their wives and kids with them.
[01:10:58.222 --> 01:11:00.082]  So I said, you know, how come you can't bring your wives in?
[01:11:00.202 --> 01:11:01.543]  And they said, oh no, it's a rule.
[01:11:02.663 --> 01:11:09.124]  If you're a wage band A and B, that's the lowest paid, then you have to stay in single men's quarters.
[01:11:10.304 --> 01:11:15.045]  So I asked, what happens if your wife gets a job in the mining town, say as a cleaner or a cook?
[01:11:16.285 --> 01:11:19.066]  And oh, she has to then stay in single women's quarters.
[01:11:19.722 --> 01:11:25.164]  And there's a sign up on the wall that if you're caught sleeping with your husband then you can be banished from the town.
[01:11:26.184 --> 01:11:42.149]  So basically it's still slavery going on and I've seen the video deep inside these giant dangerous mines but I want to get into the history of who the Oppenheimers are, how they got this monopoly and then how they have literally these warehouses full of diamonds.
[01:11:43.169 --> 01:11:46.290]  Okay, well it started with a bloke called Cecil Rhodes.
[01:11:47.747 --> 01:11:59.650]  British Colonial Servant went out there, saw these diamonds coming out of the ground, got in touch with the investors in Europe and said, look, you're right about the price of your investments.
[01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:14.433]  If you fund me, I'll buy up control in Southern Africa with your money, buy up all the diamond mining leases, on the proviso that I'll sell the diamonds only to a cartel that you set up.
[01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:17.476]  And that was the origin for the De Beers Company.
[01:12:17.816 --> 01:12:20.258]  It was actually set up to keep diamonds rare.
[01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:23.160]  Not to produce them, but to keep them rare.
[01:12:24.481 --> 01:12:36.068]  Later on, just the year he died, a family working a diamond company in this cartel in Europe, the Oppenheimer family, moved out to Southern Africa, and they came to take this over.
[01:12:36.328 --> 01:12:43.873]  They first got control over the German mines at the end of the First World War, the mines in what was South West Africa,
[01:12:45.851 --> 01:12:47.312]  They used that to break Tobias.
[01:12:47.352 --> 01:12:53.278]  They said, look, we've got diamonds and we're going to compete against you unless you make our guy chairman of Tobias.
[01:12:54.419 --> 01:12:57.181]  And that's how the Oppenheimers took over the company.
[01:12:57.201 --> 01:13:00.764]  Okay, now do me a favor... This has to be controlled by just one family.
[01:13:00.784 --> 01:13:03.307]  The Church of England family, by the way.
[01:13:03.327 --> 01:13:05.949]  It's not a Jewish family, just in case people are mistaken.
[01:13:06.609 --> 01:13:08.151]  I don't think I said that.
[01:13:08.171 --> 01:13:10.153]  No, no, it's alright.
[01:13:10.273 --> 01:13:12.214]  People are going to say things... It's not...
[01:13:13.567 --> 01:13:15.849]  The family is a Christian family.
[01:13:16.449 --> 01:13:17.470]  Yeah.
[01:13:18.231 --> 01:13:20.272]  I thought Oppenheimer was either Dutch or German.
[01:13:20.913 --> 01:13:22.654]  It's German to start off with.
[01:13:23.314 --> 01:13:24.115]  Yeah.
[01:13:24.255 --> 01:13:26.117]  But I know they married him with some Dutch as well.
[01:13:26.157 --> 01:13:27.257]  These families all in her breed.
[01:13:28.178 --> 01:13:29.039]  Just do me a favor.
[01:13:29.119 --> 01:13:29.959]  It's your cell phone.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:30.940]  It's overdriving.
[01:13:31.321 --> 01:13:32.321]  And it distorts.
[01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:33.422]  So be sure and back off that.
[01:13:33.462 --> 01:13:34.103]  I apologize.
[01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.784]  Just be sure and don't overdrive.
[01:13:36.491 --> 01:13:37.271]  Is that any better?
[01:13:37.631 --> 01:13:38.552]  That's a lot better, yes.
[01:13:39.092 --> 01:13:39.432]  Okay.
[01:13:39.572 --> 01:13:40.132]  I apologize.
[01:13:40.172 --> 01:13:40.972]  Just try to keep it right there.
[01:13:40.992 --> 01:13:41.312]  That's okay.
[01:13:41.352 --> 01:13:42.953]  It's got a loudspeaker on it and the earphones.
[01:13:42.973 --> 01:13:43.953]  I just moved it further away.
[01:13:44.313 --> 01:13:44.593]  Okay.
[01:13:45.334 --> 01:13:45.774]  Yeah.
[01:13:46.894 --> 01:13:51.255]  It's... We'll fix the phone problem during the next break.
[01:13:51.335 --> 01:13:51.995]  Just a little tip.
[01:13:52.035 --> 01:13:57.197]  You don't want to do interviews with one of those headpieces because they always overdrive and distort.
[01:13:57.897 --> 01:13:59.838]  But we'll try to get you on a landline here during the break.
[01:14:00.258 --> 01:14:00.358]  Okay.
[01:14:00.398 --> 01:14:02.458]  Is that any better now?
[01:14:02.498 --> 01:14:04.379]  Yeah, that's a lot better.
[01:14:04.853 --> 01:14:06.956]  I have done quite a few on this.
[01:14:20.316 --> 01:14:27.278]  Again, everything you're saying is accurate from the history I researched, but as you said, you've written a book about this, you've been in the mines, you've interviewed people inside this system.
[01:14:27.779 --> 01:14:40.203]  How valuable would diamonds really be if there wasn't this global cartel, and if you could get diamonds out of Canada, diamonds out of South America, if you could get diamonds out of
[01:14:41.444 --> 01:14:52.393]  Arkansas, if you could get diamonds out of all of Africa, I mean, if it was just free market and it wasn't a monopoly, how much would diamonds really be worth?
[01:14:53.133 --> 01:14:55.435]  Oh my God, it would be less than $5 a diamond.
[01:14:58.198 --> 01:15:08.006]  The cost of production I found was around, in South Africa it's around $7 a carat, of carat weight of diamonds.
[01:15:09.228 --> 01:15:10.889]  And they're cut today.
[01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:16.212]  Diamonds are cut for 25 cents each by kids in India.
[01:15:16.432 --> 01:15:17.333]  Young people in India.
[01:15:19.154 --> 01:15:20.535]  So the cost is minute.
[01:15:20.615 --> 01:15:24.817]  So rubies, emeralds, other gems are much rarer than diamonds.
[01:15:26.298 --> 01:15:26.959]  Just as you said.
[01:15:27.999 --> 01:15:31.221]  Now for those who don't understand this, again I've had family who's been in this business.
[01:15:31.501 --> 01:15:35.764]  My dad ran out of college for a few years, worked for a French family.
[01:15:36.921 --> 01:15:38.744]  Uh, out of South Africa.
[01:15:39.446 --> 01:15:40.908]  Uh, have you ever heard of the Bull Brothers?
[01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:42.731]  I have, indeed.
[01:15:43.092 --> 01:15:43.452]  Yeah.
[01:15:44.093 --> 01:15:50.204]  And so, I mean, that's how I have like the inside scoop on this, and most people just aren't even aware of it, even though it's an open secret.
[01:15:51.514 --> 01:16:04.440]  I mean, diamonds basically grow on trees, folks, but I know people who mortgage their house or go into debt to buy that $5,000, $10,000 diamond ring for a marriage, and it's a complete fraud.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.062]  As you said, $5 a carat and a couple dollars to cut them, or even less.
[01:16:09.082 --> 01:16:11.323]  25 cents to cut them.
[01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:17.400]  And people aren't going to stop though.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:26.987]  In your book you also get into how, we're not talking about Zarconians, we're talking about real diamonds that the military has a patent on creating as well.
[01:16:28.068 --> 01:16:33.132]  Yeah, I filmed a woman working for the military in Washington D.C.
[01:16:34.453 --> 01:16:44.380]  She was in the Air Force and she was growing a diamond just using an oxy-acetylene torch and gas for next door sewage work.
[01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:45.711]  And it's a big joke.
[01:16:47.012 --> 01:16:55.759]  They just inject some gas from search works into the flame of the torch and a diamond, a real diamond, crystallizes out.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:02.965]  And that technique now has now been picked up by a couple of companies, one in Florida, the other up in Massachusetts.
[01:17:03.646 --> 01:17:05.047]  And they're using the same technique.
[01:17:05.067 --> 01:17:06.228]  But it's been around a long time.
[01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:10.892]  And I found that De Beers has in fact been using this technique to grow diamonds.
[01:17:11.778 --> 01:17:17.141]  It's got a plant that does it in England, in the Isle of Man, and it's got another plant in South Africa.
[01:17:17.161 --> 01:17:23.924]  So they've been keeping real quiet about this, but these are Florida Stamens, the one in the million that they're growing.
[01:17:25.604 --> 01:17:26.205]  Amazing!
[01:17:26.305 --> 01:17:28.946]  So, there's so much I want to talk about.
[01:17:28.986 --> 01:17:33.148]  We're so honored to have you on the broadcast with us.
[01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:35.209]  I mean, there's so many facets to this.
[01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:37.410]  I want to get into what the
[01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:48.557]  How the Oppenheimers tried to stop you from publishing your book, and then I also want to get into how they admittedly go in with mercenary forces and take over countries that refuse to be part of their cartel.
[01:17:49.917 --> 01:17:50.257]  Okay.
[01:17:51.817 --> 01:17:55.338]  Just before we break, how did they try to stop you from publishing your book?
[01:17:57.339 --> 01:18:01.240]  I can't be 100% sure, but you know I made that film that was on
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:28.603]  PBS Network, the Diamond Empire film, and right during that, Mr. Oppenheimer himself, the current chairman, intervened with the BBC and put me under a lot of pressure with the BBC, and then when I got Doubleday to contract to do the book, and they gave me a round-the-world book contract, told me that the manuscript was sensational and accomplished, and then just three months before the book was due to print,
[01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:36.915]  After they'd advertised it, after two major newspapers had lined up to serialize it, they suddenly cancelled.
[01:18:37.636 --> 01:18:48.566]  And a letter they sent me said that rich and important businessmen did not want the book to come out, and although we might win any legal action... Okay, we've got a break.
[01:18:48.587 --> 01:18:50.448]  We'll be right back with our incredible guest.
[01:18:50.468 --> 01:18:50.929]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.102 --> 01:18:56.463]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:18:56.723 --> 01:19:00.543]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:19:00.884 --> 01:19:01.684]  Read the labels.
[01:19:02.124 --> 01:19:06.245]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:19:06.465 --> 01:19:10.646]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:19:11.026 --> 01:19:15.907]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:19:16.287 --> 01:19:19.848]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:19:20.048 --> 01:19:25.390]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:28.410]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:19:28.711 --> 01:19:29.591]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:56.140]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.242]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:59.522 --> 01:20:03.683]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:04.104 --> 01:20:04.924]  So what do you do?
[01:20:05.244 --> 01:20:09.806]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.427]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:20:53.021 --> 01:20:54.001]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:58.864]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:20:59.024 --> 01:21:06.847]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:21:07.107 --> 01:21:12.470]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:19.653]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:21:19.953 --> 01:21:25.297]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:21:25.557 --> 01:21:30.280]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:38.245]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:21:38.565 --> 01:21:44.048]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:46.811]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:47.691 --> 01:21:49.893]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.135 --> 01:21:55.158]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:21:55.178 --> 01:21:58.040]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:05.346]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:08.829]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[01:22:09.089 --> 01:22:11.051]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency
[01:22:11.431 --> 01:22:19.296]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering the lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:22:19.536 --> 01:22:20.817]  Either way, why chance it?
[01:22:20.917 --> 01:22:24.279]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555.

[01:22:54.409 --> 01:22:57.190]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:57.730 --> 01:23:01.090]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.091 --> 01:23:23.515]  All right, my friends, Jeanine Roberts shot her documentary, which I've seen and is amazing, in six continents, and it aired on PBS, got censored over in England, and I have been inside and seen the inside, just locally, of the diamond business, and believe me, this is what's going on.
[01:23:24.167 --> 01:23:29.209]  And it's a great example of how what we think is the truth is really the complete opposite of the truth.
[01:23:29.389 --> 01:23:29.849]  Diamonds.
[01:23:30.049 --> 01:23:34.390]  Warehouses full of just giant crates of diamonds.
[01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:35.511]  They've been hoarding them.
[01:23:35.831 --> 01:23:38.051]  Their business isn't selling you diamonds.
[01:23:38.452 --> 01:23:46.014]  Their business is controlling and monopolizing them because, again, five to six dollars a carat, just a few cents to cut them.
[01:23:47.472 --> 01:23:56.049]  And meanwhile, you're spending $5,000, $6,000, $10,000 because you've got to get your wife that big two-carat diamond for that wedding or for that anniversary.
[01:23:57.621 --> 01:23:59.562]  And just an amazing documentary she made.
[01:23:59.602 --> 01:24:01.242]  Of course, she wrote the book Glitter and Greed.
[01:24:01.562 --> 01:24:02.722]  And why is she on a cell phone?
[01:24:02.742 --> 01:24:07.904]  She's on her boat, her 45-foot boat, off of the coast of England via cell phone.
[01:24:07.924 --> 01:24:09.904]  And it's great to have her, Janine Roberts.
[01:24:10.465 --> 01:24:25.409]  Janine, let's get back into the TV documentary that you did, that I'm sure a lot of our listeners saw, and then get into how, according to the New Yorker magazine, De Beers hires mercenaries to go into countries and literally invade diamond mines that are unauthorized.
[01:24:25.449 --> 01:24:25.949]  Tell us about it.
[01:24:26.872 --> 01:24:29.574]  Yeah, we actually found one and interviewed him for the film.
[01:24:31.275 --> 01:24:38.159]  The guy was employed, in his own testimony, so it's alleged, but he said this is what he did, and he was well known for it.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:50.747]  He'd been in West Africa for De Beers, intercepting with his mercenaries, groups of Africans out trying to trade diamonds, independently, outside the cartel.
[01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:56.793]  And he said he captured people, held them in prison, and that he tortured people.
[01:24:58.194 --> 01:25:00.655]  And he said he was employed to do this by the beers.
[01:25:01.055 --> 01:25:03.477]  By his own words, we didn't have a contract to see.
[01:25:04.471 --> 01:25:06.972]  But it was a notorious case.
[01:25:07.372 --> 01:25:11.092]  Well did you see the big cover story I guess four years ago in New Yorker?
[01:25:11.452 --> 01:25:14.633]  Where they bragged about it and how they were going to have the U.S.
[01:25:14.673 --> 01:25:20.754]  military invade the African coast to stop these quote, conflict diamonds?
[01:25:21.154 --> 01:25:22.735]  I mean that was admitted a few years ago.
[01:25:22.755 --> 01:25:27.156]  Oh you know, this conflict diamonds thing, we really should have it made fair.
[01:25:27.936 --> 01:25:33.057]  At the moment it's only diamonds produced by rebels that go under conflict diamonds.
[01:25:33.832 --> 01:25:43.356]  And Amnesty International has just pointed out there's a big mine in the Congo and there are literally bodies floating down the river past the gates of the mine.
[01:25:43.636 --> 01:25:46.477]  Bodies of people murdered by the staff of the mine.
[01:25:47.378 --> 01:25:49.458]  And it said, well, these weren't conflict diamonds.
[01:25:49.658 --> 01:25:58.542]  They're sold as conflict-free diamonds to America because the mine is run by the Congo government with the help of De Beers.
[01:25:58.602 --> 01:26:00.343]  De Beers has got a corporate interest in it.
[01:26:00.863 --> 01:26:03.364]  Well, that meant there weren't conflicts because they weren't run by rebels.
[01:26:04.588 --> 01:26:12.411]  So really, we need to look again at this conflict diamond business and say all mines should follow one code of ethics.
[01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:17.413]  Well let's go over your incredible documentary film.
[01:26:17.573 --> 01:26:18.293]  Tell us about that.
[01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:20.854]  Well that was hair raising.
[01:26:21.715 --> 01:26:28.417]  I had to raise over a million dollars to make it and my previous film had been pretty low budget, made with aborigines and the outback.
[01:26:33.464 --> 01:26:34.824]  The beers tried to do everything.
[01:26:36.285 --> 01:26:39.606]  We got bans from diamond mines, and then we got inside them.
[01:26:40.446 --> 01:26:49.929]  When we got to New York with our film crew, we found that most of the diamond merchants down on Fifth Avenue had phone calls, telling them not to talk to us.
[01:26:51.829 --> 01:26:58.771]  But eventually I met this lovely gentleman, Mr. Goldberg, William Goldberg,
[01:26:59.696 --> 01:27:07.560]  He runs a very large, he ran, he died recently unfortunately, but he runs a big diamond practice where he cuts diamonds the size of pigeon eggs.
[01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:09.881]  On Fifth Avenue.
[01:27:10.862 --> 01:27:20.667]  And, er, he, I said, um, he said, I turned up with my film crew, and he said to me, I think I'm the wrong man for you.
[01:27:21.547 --> 01:27:25.950]  Well I was a bit horrified, I really depended on getting this guy on camera.
[01:27:27.391 --> 01:27:28.031]  And, er,
[01:27:29.284 --> 01:27:30.925]  So I said, did you get a phone call?
[01:27:31.085 --> 01:27:32.666]  He said, yes I did get a phone call.
[01:27:33.926 --> 01:27:40.349]  I was told that you worked with blacks in Australia and helped them fight diamond mines.
[01:27:40.369 --> 01:27:43.911]  Now all I could say was guilty as charged.
[01:27:44.271 --> 01:27:45.872]  I had worked with blacks in Australia.
[01:27:46.993 --> 01:27:56.077]  Then we had a big talk about that and I said, look Jewish people have got sacred places in Israel and Aboriginal people have got sacred bits of land in Australia.
[01:27:56.798 --> 01:27:57.838]  It's all much the same.
[01:27:58.039 --> 01:28:03.241]  It's land that people think of as sacred and they didn't want others to trespass on them and destroy it.
[01:28:03.781 --> 01:28:10.564]  Because in Australia they found the world's, what's now the world's biggest diamond mine on top of a place that was sacred to women.
[01:28:11.264 --> 01:28:15.426]  It was a place that women have been going to, to pray for thousands of years.
[01:28:16.326 --> 01:28:19.467]  Up in the northwest of Australia, on top of a mountain range.
[01:28:20.288 --> 01:28:21.248]  Very sacred place.
[01:28:22.441 --> 01:28:27.905]  And now that place is totally destroyed today over the opposition of the aboriginal people.
[01:28:28.686 --> 01:28:35.111]  And today it's an enormous pit producing some seven tons of diamonds every year.
[01:28:35.872 --> 01:28:39.175]  We'll be right back with our guests, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:39.195 --> 01:28:41.536]  You're getting ripped off of these diamonds.
[01:28:41.576 --> 01:28:42.017]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.058 --> 01:28:44.979]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.101]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.982 --> 01:28:50.664]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.184 --> 01:29:01.685]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.105 --> 01:29:06.326]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.566 --> 01:29:13.588]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.968 --> 01:29:20.090]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:21.430]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:24.734]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.894 --> 01:29:26.896]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:27.217 --> 01:29:34.465]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:34.766 --> 01:29:38.150]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:58.838]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:29:59.138 --> 01:30:04.580]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:08.922]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:30:09.263 --> 01:30:12.264]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:12.584 --> 01:30:16.026]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:30:16.346 --> 01:30:25.696]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:25.956 --> 01:30:29.480]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:36.808]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:30:37.048 --> 01:30:39.270]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.
[01:30:39.511 --> 01:30:44.957]  Get two for $70.00 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:53.931 --> 01:30:55.393]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:30:55.613 --> 01:31:02.941]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:31:03.262 --> 01:31:07.667]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:31:07.947 --> 01:31:10.210]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste.
[01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:17.792]  Big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:31:17.812 --> 01:31:22.193]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:31:22.533 --> 01:31:25.054]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:31:25.314 --> 01:31:31.196]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:31:31.496 --> 01:31:33.138]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:31:33.298 --> 01:31:34.199]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:31:34.279 --> 01:31:37.283]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:31:37.423 --> 01:31:39.706]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:31:40.046 --> 01:31:43.250]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:31:44.051 --> 01:31:48.135]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:31:48.276 --> 01:31:49.177]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:31:58.698 --> 01:32:00.599]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:03.942]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:32:05.863 --> 01:32:12.648]  Veteran investigative author Janine Roberts overcame numerous obstacles and dangers to bring us her findings.
[01:32:12.688 --> 01:32:21.395]  She went to six continents and made the most incredible film I've ever seen exposing monopolies concerning the diamond trade.
[01:32:22.175 --> 01:32:24.237]  And she's got the book Glitter and Greed
[01:32:25.086 --> 01:32:27.168]  And we have a bookstore on Infowars.com.
[01:32:27.188 --> 01:32:31.392]  I ought to get a hold of her publisher and carry this because this is such an illustration.
[01:32:31.432 --> 01:32:32.774]  And it's the same thing with the oil.
[01:32:33.194 --> 01:32:34.616]  It's the same thing now with water.
[01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:41.623]  These same institutions and families are monopolizing key parts of the economy
[01:32:42.603 --> 01:32:44.184]  And running massive scams.
[01:32:44.224 --> 01:32:45.944]  They create artificial scarcity.
[01:32:46.344 --> 01:32:47.784]  We'll be talking to her in just a few minutes.
[01:32:47.904 --> 01:32:51.565]  And then if you want to talk to her yourselves, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:51.585 --> 01:32:52.285]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:52.305 --> 01:33:02.248]  She's joining us from her own boat off the coast of England out there via cell phone.
[01:33:03.028 --> 01:33:03.728]  We're honored to have her.
[01:33:03.968 --> 01:33:06.289]  We'll get back to her here in just one moment.
[01:33:06.909 --> 01:33:07.649]  But think about that.
[01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:09.229]  Giant warehouses full of diamonds.
[01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:11.390]  A world monopoly.
[01:33:12.126 --> 01:33:12.748]  Mercenaries!
[01:33:12.809 --> 01:33:15.943]  Troops slaughtering those that dare try to dig them out of the ground themselves!
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:21.562]  That's why diamond prices went down a few years ago is because there were some people leaking out just a small quantity of them.
[01:33:21.902 --> 01:33:23.562]  We'll go back to her here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:24.022 --> 01:33:29.364]  With all the uncertainty and all the talk of terror attacks and all the rest of this, shouldn't you have an insurance policy?
[01:33:29.904 --> 01:33:35.346]  Ready Reserve Foods has gained the reputation of providing virtually the finest dehydrated, storable foods available.
[01:33:35.666 --> 01:33:40.808]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in the United States.
[01:33:41.208 --> 01:33:46.390]  Food units need no refrigeration because they're nitrogen-packed, which vastly extends their shelf life.
[01:33:46.891 --> 01:33:49.799]  Folks, I got a year food supply.
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:51.881]  For two people from them.
[01:33:52.361 --> 01:33:53.762]  And I am so happy with it.
[01:33:53.802 --> 01:33:55.263]  It'll store for a decade.
[01:33:55.663 --> 01:33:57.064]  And I've bought storable food before.
[01:33:57.124 --> 01:33:58.504]  It's an insurance policy you can eat.
[01:33:58.925 --> 01:34:00.385]  It's just something I have for my family.
[01:34:00.625 --> 01:34:03.487]  Let me tell you, this is the highest quality I've ever seen, folks.
[01:34:03.887 --> 01:34:05.028]  I am blown away by them.
[01:34:05.248 --> 01:34:06.709]  They've got a new special.
[01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:10.751]  Normally, a one-year food supply is $14.95 plus shipping.
[01:34:10.771 --> 01:34:11.411]  It's now only $12.95.
[01:34:11.451 --> 01:34:11.411]  $1,295.
[01:34:11.491 --> 01:34:12.912]  And the shipping is free.
[01:34:18.533 --> 01:34:19.794]  Shipping's like 300 bucks.
[01:34:20.735 --> 01:34:24.798]  So, you need to take advantage of this now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:27.200]  I ordered it and got it in about a week and a half.
[01:34:27.741 --> 01:34:29.102]  Just amazing quality.
[01:34:29.282 --> 01:34:31.083]  All grown right here in the United States.
[01:34:31.664 --> 01:34:33.405]  All from here in the United States.
[01:34:34.206 --> 01:34:37.288]  You need to give Ready Reserve Foods a call right now.
[01:34:37.308 --> 01:34:37.849]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:34:37.869 --> 01:34:37.969]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:34:37.989 --> 01:34:40.671]  Or go to ReadyReserveFoods.com and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:34:48.914 --> 01:34:53.857]  Now, I'm also a documentary filmmaker, and I have made 11 films.
[01:34:53.917 --> 01:34:59.680]  My 11th film, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004 is out.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:08.985]  It shows how Bush and Kerry are actually identical on their policies, how they're related, how they're part of the same secret society, the police state they're setting up, how they're both for Patriot Act II.
[01:35:09.825 --> 01:35:11.025]  It's a great new film.
[01:35:11.165 --> 01:35:12.786]  You need to have 90 minutes long, 1995.
[01:35:14.306 --> 01:35:19.667]  Available on Infowars.com or presentplanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:19.688 --> 01:35:19.868]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:30.251 --> 01:35:34.493]  And to the films, my first ten films are all over two hours long, they're $25.95.
[01:35:34.933 --> 01:35:43.077]  Order three or more, they drop down to $19.95 apiece, that is a substantial discount, and your purchase of the film supports this broadcast.
[01:35:43.097 --> 01:35:43.577]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:44.218 --> 01:35:50.461]  We also have both my 9-11 films, exposing what really happened on 9-11.
[01:35:50.721 --> 01:35:52.782]  George Humphrey's 9-11 film, which is excellent.
[01:35:53.082 --> 01:35:54.583]  Eric Huffman's 9-11 video.
[01:35:54.843 --> 01:35:56.023]  Two books on 9-11.
[01:35:56.244 --> 01:35:57.144]  It's all available at
[01:35:57.244 --> 01:36:00.927]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:00.947 --> 01:36:11.496]  You can read both the books, watch all my videos, watch my weekly TV show that's posted there weekly, and listen to the best radio interviews we do like this one that will be posted by tomorrow.
[01:36:12.397 --> 01:36:13.938]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:14.278 --> 01:36:18.001]  Alright, shifting gears back to our guest, Glitter and Greed.
[01:36:18.262 --> 01:36:24.567]  First off, before we get any deeper into this and then take some calls, Janine, how do people get a copy of Glitter and Greed?
[01:36:25.328 --> 01:36:27.190]  I can get a copy of my film as well.
[01:36:27.210 --> 01:36:28.270]  It's on my website.
[01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:29.812]  You can take it off there.
[01:36:30.352 --> 01:36:31.133]  Oh, awesome.
[01:36:31.153 --> 01:36:31.953]  How do we go there?
[01:36:31.993 --> 01:36:37.598]  Yeah, I've got it on CDs and people can get through PayPal on my website.
[01:36:37.738 --> 01:36:39.199]  Can I just give my website address?
[01:36:39.359 --> 01:36:39.859]  Please do it, yes.
[01:36:39.919 --> 01:36:43.962]  It's got a photograph of black people in Africa inside diamond mines and all that.
[01:36:44.543 --> 01:36:45.123]  Please do.
[01:36:45.804 --> 01:36:47.625]  Yeah, it's quite easy to remember.
[01:36:47.685 --> 01:36:48.986]  It's www.sparkle.com.
[01:36:52.441 --> 01:37:20.554]  www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.splus.com www.
[01:37:24.776 --> 01:37:29.078]  All right, and we have a link to that on InfoWars.com.
[01:37:29.158 --> 01:37:30.958]  I highly recommend the film.
[01:37:31.058 --> 01:37:34.139]  Yeah, the film's up there, and the book Tell the Story.
[01:37:34.439 --> 01:37:38.301]  I should say, by the time I finished doing that film, I was critically ill in hospital.
[01:37:38.321 --> 01:37:40.421]  I was beaten up myself by a gang.
[01:37:43.507 --> 01:37:44.728]  I was two months in hospital.
[01:37:45.689 --> 01:37:48.291]  This is an amazing story.
[01:37:48.311 --> 01:37:49.592]  We could spend ten hours on it.
[01:37:49.832 --> 01:37:51.693]  Describe how you were beaten up by a gang.
[01:37:53.514 --> 01:37:54.956]  Right in the middle of being in a shoot.
[01:37:55.116 --> 01:37:57.277]  It was just after the South African shoot.
[01:37:58.138 --> 01:38:01.220]  A gang broke up onto my boat actually.
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:01.841]  It was on a berth.
[01:38:03.742 --> 01:38:05.944]  There was a woman present.
[01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:10.167]  They got onto the boat and they smashed my face up basically.
[01:38:10.187 --> 01:38:11.208]  They broke my cheekbone.
[01:38:11.228 --> 01:38:12.829]  They broke my nose.
[01:38:13.783 --> 01:38:35.841]  I had every blow through blood but I had a ship to shore emergency radio to contact the Coast Guard and I just had to hit a button and I could yell out, I didn't have to pick anything up and I yelled and the Coast Guard replied over the loudspeaker system and the gang fled and that's what saved me.
[01:38:36.042 --> 01:38:37.803]  Where were you when this happened?
[01:38:38.323 --> 01:38:40.065]  I was on the Thames, I was in London.
[01:38:41.161 --> 01:38:45.143]  Do you believe this was a hired gang or just a normal criminal gang?
[01:38:45.163 --> 01:38:54.648]  I think it was because lawyers ambushed me the next day and tried to take the film off me and I had it all black and blue and I thought this is just amazing.
[01:38:54.688 --> 01:38:57.270]  Say that again, who tried to get your film?
[01:38:58.911 --> 01:39:02.352]  A group of lawyers tried to seize the film the next day but failed.
[01:39:04.514 --> 01:39:08.816]  It was just that they were saying, with DeBeers opposed to you,
[01:39:09.338 --> 01:39:12.081]  You can't finish this film, so other people must take it over.
[01:39:13.041 --> 01:39:18.627]  But the film did get finished, and when it went out on PBS Network, it was according to my script.
[01:39:19.307 --> 01:39:20.268]  But it was all hell.
[01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:22.830]  I was just... I'm just pretty stubborn.
[01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:25.333]  I hate people trying to silence me, you know?
[01:39:26.414 --> 01:39:28.696]  These big guys, they need someone to watch them.
[01:39:29.216 --> 01:39:29.637]  And, um...
[01:39:31.351 --> 01:39:39.453]  Well Janine, I recommend everybody again go to your website and for those that missed it just one more time to get a DVD copy of the film.
[01:39:39.493 --> 01:39:41.334]  Tell them the name of the film and the website please.
[01:39:41.714 --> 01:39:44.534]  Yeah, it's the film Diamond Empire.
[01:39:44.675 --> 01:39:47.175]  It's on my website and it's on a CD.
[01:39:47.215 --> 01:39:48.215]  You don't need a DVD.
[01:39:48.255 --> 01:39:50.916]  You can show it on any computer.
[01:39:50.976 --> 01:39:53.177]  It doesn't matter if it's a Mac or a PC.
[01:39:55.798 --> 01:40:00.803]  And it comes in a collection of about a hundred photographs taken aside to be as mines by myself.
[01:40:02.265 --> 01:40:05.308]  And that's all on my website for $49.
[01:40:06.068 --> 01:40:08.831]  And the website is www.sparkle.plus.com
[01:40:17.489 --> 01:40:19.270]  All right, well that's amazing.
[01:40:20.951 --> 01:40:26.354]  People want to email me from the site and I'm very welcome, very happy to answer questions.
[01:40:26.434 --> 01:40:30.476]  Okay, well I want to take some time out to take a few calls here in a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:40:30.576 --> 01:40:36.719]  But first off, I mean there's so much to talk about here.
[01:40:36.739 --> 01:40:41.702]  I want to go back into the mechanics of the Oppenheimer family, their world monopoly over diamonds.
[01:40:42.362 --> 01:40:44.163]  And you've got the evidence.
[01:40:44.303 --> 01:40:49.006]  It's admitted that a carat diamond is $5-$6 per carat.
[01:40:49.387 --> 01:40:50.547]  Almost nothing to cut it.
[01:40:51.508 --> 01:40:55.531]  And then that their real business is making sure that diamonds don't get released out on the market.
[01:40:55.951 --> 01:40:57.072]  Where do they store?
[01:40:57.092 --> 01:40:58.533]  Because your film has some video of this.
[01:40:59.173 --> 01:41:00.134]  Where do they store?
[01:41:00.214 --> 01:41:01.254]  I've seen the stores.
[01:41:02.035 --> 01:41:05.117]  I've actually run my hands through buckets of diamonds, literally.
[01:41:07.278 --> 01:41:09.159]  There's a major store in London.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:11.381]  In Charterhouse Street.
[01:41:11.912 --> 01:41:12.693]  We're good to go.
[01:41:42.728 --> 01:41:43.969]  So they have to pay.
[01:41:44.029 --> 01:41:45.090]  It's every five weeks.
[01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:46.731]  They have to come to London.
[01:41:47.252 --> 01:41:53.576]  And the reason that American merchants have to come to London is because in America it would be illegal under the Sherman Act.
[01:41:54.097 --> 01:41:55.698]  Because it's a cartel activity.
[01:41:55.918 --> 01:41:56.559]  Antitrust.
[01:41:57.159 --> 01:41:59.741]  Yeah, under the Antitrust Act.
[01:41:59.761 --> 01:42:07.687]  So these rich American millionaires, billionaires that come across, they have to come across and pay in advance before they get their box of diamonds.
[01:42:08.448 --> 01:42:12.331]  And if they're being a good boy, if they haven't been buying any Russian diamonds or
[01:42:13.075 --> 01:42:15.096]  A lot of diamonds that De Beers doesn't control.
[01:42:16.416 --> 01:42:20.178]  Then they might open their box up and find some really nice stones inside it.
[01:42:21.279 --> 01:42:30.903]  But if they've been bad, they've been buying some rebel diamonds, or Russian diamonds, or Australian diamonds, they'll cut their box and they might find worthless diamonds inside.
[01:42:32.043 --> 01:42:35.645]  And if they protest, they won't get an invitation again.
[01:42:37.074 --> 01:42:38.575]  So again, this is how the Monopoly works.
[01:42:38.595 --> 01:42:39.455]  This is all on video.
[01:42:39.475 --> 01:42:40.116]  This is admitted.
[01:42:40.596 --> 01:42:46.399]  You go in, and they hand you the box, and you've already prepaid, and that's what you get.
[01:42:46.699 --> 01:42:51.681]  But if you've bought any of the diamonds that aren't part of the Monopoly, and I've heard that the Monopoly still controls, what, 95%?
[01:42:52.161 --> 01:42:56.303]  Is that an accurate number, that they still control 95% of the diamonds?
[01:42:56.784 --> 01:43:00.265]  No, they're marketing more like they've fallen back a bit.
[01:43:00.365 --> 01:43:02.846]  It's more like they're marketing around 70% to 80% now.
[01:43:04.884 --> 01:43:10.025]  So since I read articles about it a few years ago that they've even lost more control over their monopoly?
[01:43:10.065 --> 01:43:12.485]  They always pretend to have more control than they really have.
[01:43:13.265 --> 01:43:18.746]  But they have secret slush funds around to buy up diamonds in different countries.
[01:43:19.486 --> 01:43:26.528]  And the trouble with the Canadian diamonds is that the Canadian companies and the Russian companies are outside De Beers.
[01:43:27.388 --> 01:43:31.729]  But why should they cut the price of their stones when De Beers keeps the price high?
[01:43:32.609 --> 01:43:34.189]  It doesn't pay them to undercut.
[01:43:34.815 --> 01:43:41.981]  So there's a kind of informal cartel being organized, including the stones outside De Beers control, like the Canadian stones.
[01:43:42.861 --> 01:43:45.783]  They're not undercutting De Beers stones, so they're getting ripped off too.
[01:43:46.304 --> 01:43:57.893]  So, I mean, how much, you know, when an average merchant comes, do they say, this is how much money I want to pay, this is how many diamonds I want, or does De Beers tell them, this is how much money you've got to pay us, and then you'll just see what you get?
[01:43:57.933 --> 01:44:00.575]  Oh no, this is a case that De Beers sets a price.
[01:44:00.835 --> 01:44:01.936]  Totally sets a price.
[01:44:02.935 --> 01:44:07.558]  And even tell us the miners contracted to it what the price is, what the value of their own stones are.
[01:44:08.999 --> 01:44:15.584]  You know, you send your diamonds in and the customer De Beers would tell you what your diamonds are worth and pay that sum.
[01:44:16.805 --> 01:44:18.847]  That's how the rough diamonds get sold to De Beers.
[01:44:19.507 --> 01:44:24.471]  Okay, so somebody comes in and buys this black box, this case of diamonds.
[01:44:24.971 --> 01:44:31.476]  What is the real value on average of what they really dug them out of the ground for versus what De Beers sells them wholesale?
[01:44:33.194 --> 01:44:36.335]  I can't really tell, because it's very, very secret, that little bit of it.
[01:44:38.675 --> 01:44:44.556]  But I think it would be less than a fifth, maybe less than a tenth of what they're actually paying.
[01:44:46.057 --> 01:44:47.277]  It depends who you are, you see.
[01:44:47.297 --> 01:44:51.798]  Like, there's this very powerful businessman, Maurice Templesman, in New York.
[01:44:52.878 --> 01:44:55.939]  And he's been a very close friend of many Presidents.
[01:44:56.859 --> 01:44:59.919]  And he's the most... and I have two chapters in my book about him.
[01:44:59.979 --> 01:45:01.980]  He's the most powerful diamond merchant in the world.
[01:45:03.098 --> 01:45:05.239]  And he's very, very close to the CIA.
[01:45:05.879 --> 01:45:28.788]  And he's been involved in several coups in Africa against... One of them, let's see, one of them was a telephone call was intercepted by intelligence and it was a coup in West Africa and the communications coming back to the States were coming through his office in the United States and the State Department got very angry with him
[01:45:29.454 --> 01:45:35.497]  Because he's used an unguarded telephone line, and he betrayed the identity of the CIA head of station.
[01:45:35.837 --> 01:45:38.399]  And so what happens is he gets the diamonds real cheap.
[01:45:39.399 --> 01:45:42.240]  Yeah, the whole thing is very, very intelligence-led.
[01:45:42.301 --> 01:45:43.661]  It's very covert.
[01:45:44.402 --> 01:45:47.583]  There's lots of nasty business going on to keep this cartel together.
[01:45:49.164 --> 01:45:53.246]  And it's... Our people are just being exploited through the roof.
[01:45:53.746 --> 01:45:57.008]  And by keeping the price of diamonds so high, when they're so cheap to produce,
[01:45:57.816 --> 01:45:59.537]  That's why terrorists can now use them.
[01:46:00.117 --> 01:46:02.318]  Because they're easy, they're common in Africa.
[01:46:03.198 --> 01:46:05.839]  So, you may as well, and they're common in Arkansas.
[01:46:06.499 --> 01:46:07.879]  They're not just rare stones.
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:17.843]  I mean, I went to Arkansas, to this diamond mine, and I got all the geology reports for this diamond mine in, um, down in Arkansas.
[01:46:18.423 --> 01:46:24.125]  What I did, I went and used Freedom of Information in Washington to get the
[01:46:25.239 --> 01:46:30.261]  Justice Department's investigations of Tobias as an illegal cartel.
[01:46:30.841 --> 01:46:37.384]  And I found all these memos and letters and things and I've used them in the book and I reproduced them in the book and I used them in the film.
[01:46:39.325 --> 01:46:42.286]  Anyway, the Arkansas has got a really good deposit of diamonds.
[01:46:42.366 --> 01:46:45.127]  All the geology reports say it's as good as anything in South Africa.
[01:46:46.267 --> 01:46:52.590]  If you go to Arkansas today, it's a national partner diamond mine and you're not allowed to dig deeper than four feet
[01:46:54.677 --> 01:46:56.498]  And then you must fill up the hole when you finish.
[01:46:56.858 --> 01:46:58.119]  And again, I've been there.
[01:46:58.159 --> 01:46:58.999]  This is what they do.
[01:46:59.699 --> 01:47:07.882]  We've got this giant diamond deposit for the American people and we're not even allowed to have those diamonds because it's for environmental reasons.
[01:47:09.143 --> 01:47:11.723]  So anything to keep the monopoly in place?
[01:47:12.284 --> 01:47:17.305]  Well, the only place in the world that a diamond mine could not be controlled by the cartel is the United States.
[01:47:18.226 --> 01:47:19.506]  Because of the Antitrust Act.
[01:47:21.781 --> 01:47:23.782]  That's what the family that used to own it believed.
[01:47:23.822 --> 01:47:26.503]  They believed that their mine was sabotaged by De Beers.
[01:47:27.123 --> 01:47:27.964]  That's what they told me.
[01:47:28.004 --> 01:47:34.487]  Well, I know that family, uh, you know, very well, and that's exactly what happened to the Bull family.
[01:47:34.507 --> 01:47:36.688]  Yeah, fine people.
[01:47:37.608 --> 01:47:38.929]  But they got run off their own land.
[01:47:39.609 --> 01:47:49.954]  And, actually, even sick, when the Second World War was going on, and diamonds were absolutely flying through, you know, Ford used to use diamonds from Arkansas
[01:47:50.461 --> 01:47:52.903]  To cut the steel for his TE Model Fords.
[01:47:54.544 --> 01:47:57.106]  And then they shot down the mine.
[01:47:57.246 --> 01:47:59.067]  He offered to buy the mine, Henry Ford.
[01:47:59.087 --> 01:48:01.069]  So he could keep getting the diamonds.
[01:48:01.089 --> 01:48:04.071]  He said they were better than anything he could get out of Africa, the Arkansas diamonds.
[01:48:05.532 --> 01:48:07.713]  And they still closed it down, though he'd offered to buy it.
[01:48:08.694 --> 01:48:16.640]  And during the Second World War, when the United States needed diamonds to make weapons to fight Hitler, that mine was kept shut.
[01:48:18.223 --> 01:48:22.744]  Even though it's really needed for strategic needs to defend the United States.
[01:48:23.184 --> 01:48:29.685]  So there's the power of this monopoly and then top people, connected to the CIA, get their special deals on the diamonds.
[01:48:30.145 --> 01:48:34.266]  Oh no, it's the same as you said, there's oil and diamonds, it's all the same.
[01:48:34.886 --> 01:48:37.146]  It's just pity there's blood on this stone.
[01:48:37.166 --> 01:48:46.988]  What I've been campaigning for is that diamonds should be, they should come out like, from Africa, with a guarantee that the mine has got no corruption in it,
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:57.566]  That it's used good worker practices, that the diamonds have been cut by people who have been paid decently, and the diamonds then should be sold with a certificate saying that.
[01:48:58.367 --> 01:49:02.809]  But then the Africans could get money from their diamonds, because why should there be so much poverty in Africa?
[01:49:02.889 --> 01:49:07.172]  Why is there disease, poverty, rape and destruction happening in Africa?
[01:49:07.272 --> 01:49:13.776]  When Africa is rolling in sweet crude oil, gold, diamonds, rubies, everything else you can imagine.
[01:49:16.269 --> 01:49:19.790]  Our companies have created the mess that is Africa.
[01:49:20.751 --> 01:49:23.192]  And we're not doing much about it.
[01:49:23.272 --> 01:49:27.153]  You know, when I see what's going on out there, and I see the richness of it.
[01:49:27.173 --> 01:49:28.353]  It's a beautiful country.
[01:49:28.453 --> 01:49:29.734]  It's a wonderful place, Africa.
[01:49:30.534 --> 01:49:31.975]  And I love it.
[01:49:32.035 --> 01:49:33.175]  Well, let me just add this.
[01:49:33.195 --> 01:49:33.755]  We've got a break.
[01:49:33.775 --> 01:49:34.956]  We'll come back and take a few calls.
[01:49:35.796 --> 01:49:36.276]  Think about it.
[01:49:36.296 --> 01:49:41.298]  You go in there like a sap to buy a one-carat diamond ring that costs $5,000, and it costs them one
[01:49:44.662 --> 01:49:46.063]  To five dollars, folks.
[01:49:47.163 --> 01:49:48.984]  Maybe six, seven dollars after it's cut.
[01:49:49.284 --> 01:49:50.245]  For that one diamond.
[01:49:51.245 --> 01:49:53.387]  I mean, this is the New World Order!
[01:49:55.588 --> 01:50:06.873]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments, such as local or national emergencies.

[01:50:15.318 --> 01:50:19.260]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:26.004]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:50:26.224 --> 01:50:31.727]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:50:31.967 --> 01:50:36.550]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:38.891]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[01:51:23.646 --> 01:51:26.410]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:51:26.730 --> 01:51:29.914]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.

[01:52:57.026 --> 01:53:00.088]  I mean, I hope people realize the magnitude of what they're hearing.
[01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:03.711]  Diamonds are all over, ever.
[01:53:04.111 --> 01:53:05.412]  Just sitting on the ground.
[01:53:06.312 --> 01:53:09.735]  They're all over Arkansas.
[01:53:09.775 --> 01:53:11.336]  You go to a state park, pay some money.
[01:53:11.376 --> 01:53:11.856]  I've been there.
[01:53:11.896 --> 01:53:12.577]  You dig in the ground.
[01:53:12.617 --> 01:53:14.158]  You find little diamonds all over the place.
[01:53:14.518 --> 01:53:21.723]  You're not allowed to dig again under four feet, and it's all been dug over a hundred times, but the ground literally glistens with small pieces of diamond.
[01:53:22.721 --> 01:53:23.981]  Uh, but no, you can't have that.
[01:53:24.161 --> 01:53:25.021]  It's for the environment.
[01:53:25.081 --> 01:53:26.202]  You know, there's always a reason.
[01:53:26.662 --> 01:53:29.122]  Just like our oil in Alaska, all that sweet crude.
[01:53:29.402 --> 01:53:31.323]  Run the country for a hundred years in one field.
[01:53:31.723 --> 01:53:32.963]  It's about monopoly.
[01:53:33.543 --> 01:53:44.065]  And they'll tell you it's scarce, and they'll have their liars tell you there's no oil, and their liars tell you there's no diamonds, and their liars now saying there's no fresh water, and it's all part of these forming cartels.
[01:53:44.705 --> 01:53:47.165]  And by the way, the CIA's involved in the narcotics, too.
[01:53:48.125 --> 01:53:49.566]  They control these monopolies.
[01:53:50.766 --> 01:53:51.666]  And it's a sick joke.
[01:53:52.712 --> 01:53:56.694]  We're talking to Janine Roberts, who's made an incredible film and written a powerful book.
[01:53:57.154 --> 01:53:59.596]  She's going to stay with us a little bit in the next hour to take all these calls.
[01:54:00.696 --> 01:54:02.957]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Tennessee.
[01:54:03.297 --> 01:54:04.618]  Don, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:54:04.658 --> 01:54:05.478]  Question or comment?
[01:54:05.638 --> 01:54:06.999]  Well, I'd like to make a comment.
[01:54:07.079 --> 01:54:20.966]  I believe I have seen her video on PBS before, because when you started commenting about people having appointments to go over there and meet them, all that kind of
[01:54:22.432 --> 01:54:31.298]  It's stuck in my brain and I seem to recall all this and it's very interesting that you say that because I believe I've already seen this on TV once before.
[01:54:31.558 --> 01:54:32.719]  Yeah, it aired years ago.
[01:54:32.739 --> 01:54:34.020]  Okay.
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:35.041]  Years ago.
[01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:36.422]  It's about 95.
[01:54:36.462 --> 01:54:36.422]  95?
[01:54:36.702 --> 01:54:37.242]  Okay.
[01:54:38.003 --> 01:54:40.185]  And then Alex, I have a comment for you.
[01:54:40.205 --> 01:54:47.770]  I was watching ESPN2 last night and they showed a commercial about militias in the U.S.
[01:54:48.731 --> 01:54:51.733]  and have you done anything about militias because
[01:54:52.813 --> 01:54:53.514]  I haven't done that.
[01:54:53.594 --> 01:54:54.614]  I've done lots of stuff on CIA.
[01:54:54.634 --> 01:54:55.655]  I've interviewed KGB generals.
[01:55:09.491 --> 01:55:12.953]  You know, I've been around, I've been to shows, radio agents.
[01:55:13.433 --> 01:55:28.982]  Yeah, I've been interviewed, I don't know, six, seven times by Japanese, British, American TV, and I did do an interview that was supposedly going to be airing on TNN about militias, and you said you thought it was... That's an official subject.
[01:55:29.222 --> 01:55:31.243]  Yes, it's going to be 8 p.m.
[01:55:31.343 --> 01:55:35.045]  Friday evening, this Friday, on ESPN2.
[01:55:35.285 --> 01:55:37.166]  I wrote this down last night when I was saying that.
[01:55:38.777 --> 01:55:39.738]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:55:39.858 --> 01:55:40.158]  Okay.
[01:55:40.538 --> 01:55:43.901]  Yeah, that's a separate issue about myself, Janine.
[01:55:44.541 --> 01:55:44.941]  Okay.
[01:55:45.442 --> 01:55:50.245]  But no, the government's demonizing anybody that wants to fight against the police state here in America.
[01:55:50.965 --> 01:55:52.587]  Let's go ahead and talk... I'm well aware of it.
[01:55:52.707 --> 01:55:54.488]  I've been in the States many times.
[01:55:55.689 --> 01:55:58.150]  Let's talk to Leon in Texas.
[01:55:58.231 --> 01:55:59.131]  Leon, you're on the air.
[01:55:59.171 --> 01:55:59.591]  Go ahead.
[01:55:59.932 --> 01:56:00.312]  Howdy.
[01:56:00.752 --> 01:56:00.952]  Yes.
[01:56:01.032 --> 01:56:01.353]  Hiya.
[01:56:01.753 --> 01:56:06.836]  I've been studying the Mexican Revolution for about eight years now.
[01:56:07.357 --> 01:56:07.537]  Uh-huh.
[01:56:08.328 --> 01:56:12.269]  And the Guggenheims pop up all the time.
[01:56:13.329 --> 01:56:14.190]  The Oppenheimers.
[01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:16.810]  No, the Guggenheims.
[01:56:17.130 --> 01:56:17.850]  Different family.
[01:56:18.651 --> 01:56:21.911]  In the personage of American Smelting and Refining Company.
[01:56:23.832 --> 01:56:30.834]  And, you know, they're big in zinc mining, silver mining, bunches of other stuff, not just diamonds.
[01:56:31.694 --> 01:56:36.035]  Yeah, there are lots of really big families that come up again and again, and that is the Rothschilds.
[01:56:36.806 --> 01:56:44.609]  The Rothschild family are on the De Beers board, and recently they're really complaining because of the anti-cartel action against De Beers in the States.
[01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:52.172]  The wife of the family, the Rothschild, can't go shopping in New York.
[01:56:52.392 --> 01:56:55.814]  She lives in Europe, because she might get arrested when she steps ashore.
[01:56:56.874 --> 01:57:00.375]  So yeah, a lot of these families are interlocked.
[01:57:00.876 --> 01:57:03.177]  These different families control different things.
[01:57:03.697 --> 01:57:05.678]  Hang on, look at all this stuff.
[01:57:08.518 --> 01:57:22.066]  Momentarily I get distracted from studying the Mexican Revolution and I start studying the Rift War in Spanish and French Morocco and guess what?
[01:57:22.466 --> 01:57:26.768]  Same company involved in the whole thing.
[01:57:28.169 --> 01:57:28.930]  That's what they do.
[01:57:28.970 --> 01:57:34.393]  If they want a natural resource they go in and create a revolution or claim terrorists are there and we invade.
[01:57:34.813 --> 01:57:35.933]  That's about the size of it.
[01:57:36.134 --> 01:57:36.854]  I hear the music.
[01:57:37.296 --> 01:57:37.796]  Are you a professor?
[01:57:37.816 --> 01:57:39.838]  Yeah, I think that's a bit of a rock in there, too.
[01:57:40.558 --> 01:57:41.879]  I tell you what, stay there.
[01:57:42.039 --> 01:57:42.719]  Stay there, Leon.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:44.340]  Hello!
[01:57:50.284 --> 01:57:50.944]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.585 --> 01:57:52.645]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.366 --> 01:57:54.486]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.107 --> 01:57:55.987]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.688 --> 01:57:57.588]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.608 --> 01:58:02.191]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.431 --> 01:58:06.494]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.069 --> 01:58:10.233]  We're talking to investigative journalist.
[01:58:11.555 --> 01:58:14.460]  She produced the PBS documentary Diamond Empire.
[01:58:14.481 --> 01:58:16.664]  She's written the book Glitter and Greed.
[01:58:17.375 --> 01:58:24.198]  We're talking about the world diamond monopoly run by the Oppenheimer family through their cartel, De Beers.
[01:58:24.679 --> 01:58:28.160]  The mercenaries, the CIA.
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:33.263]  How one carat diamond is really about five dollars and they have giant warehouses full of huge containers of them.
[01:58:33.643 --> 01:58:34.564]  This is all public.
[01:58:34.644 --> 01:58:36.445]  The average person has no idea what's going on.
[01:58:36.805 --> 01:58:39.386]  It's the same for oil or the narcotics or all of this.
[01:58:39.446 --> 01:58:40.547]  It's all run by the globalists.
[01:58:40.587 --> 01:58:44.809]  She was just getting into the Rothschilds and all these other big families that are on the board of De Beers.
[01:58:46.164 --> 01:58:46.604]  I'll keep it short.
[01:58:46.624 --> 01:58:48.205]  Pancho Villa's Division of the North started about October 1913.
[01:59:13.544 --> 01:59:16.045]  In Chihuahua State in Northern Mexico.
[01:59:17.546 --> 01:59:26.531]  And they wound up by December of 1914 in possession of Mexico City.
[01:59:27.851 --> 01:59:28.171]  Okay.
[01:59:29.332 --> 01:59:39.277]  Now, the medical train for Pancho Villa's Division of the North was organized by a guy named Dr. Husk.
[01:59:40.198 --> 01:59:41.018]  And Dr. Husk
[01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:48.520]  with the Chief Medical Officer for American Smelting and Refinery Corporation.
[01:59:50.503 --> 01:59:57.073]  So, this isn't anything new, this stuff in Africa.
[01:59:57.739 --> 01:59:59.120]  This has been going on forever.
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:01.461]  Yeah, that's what we talked about.
[02:00:01.481 --> 02:00:03.663]  It's called imperialism, you know.
[02:00:03.863 --> 02:00:04.944]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[02:00:05.664 --> 02:00:14.870]  Well, that's the whole point, is that these same families run around overthrowing countries, or if somebody takes over a country they want, they move in and take it over to continue this monopoly.
[02:00:15.110 --> 02:00:16.491]  Any comments on that, Janine?
[02:00:17.872 --> 02:00:21.514]  I'd have to again, but I saw something that's coming up.
[02:00:21.854 --> 02:00:26.237]  You might have wondered why my Diamond film hasn't been seen again in the United States.
[02:00:27.794 --> 02:00:29.775]  I mean, it should have been seen several times.
[02:00:29.795 --> 02:00:34.537]  And everyone remembers it because it's the only great investigation a cartel's ever had.
[02:00:35.837 --> 02:00:44.400]  But it's not been shown because WGBH in Boston was intimidated by threats from De Beers.
[02:00:45.741 --> 02:00:50.362]  And so the film now cannot be got from WGBH in Boston, my film.
[02:00:50.783 --> 02:00:55.764]  So my film has effectively become an underground film only available from my website.
[02:00:56.445 --> 02:00:57.465]  And this is quite shocking.
[02:00:58.795 --> 02:01:11.065]  It's just, you know, it's just like, you know, some companies give in to the tobacco cartels, and now my Darwin film has been, not because my film has been found guilty, it hasn't.
[02:01:11.425 --> 02:01:17.850]  It hasn't been found libelous, nothing's been found inaccurate about it, but stop
[02:01:18.502 --> 02:01:21.545]  They've forbidden the sale of my film in the States.
[02:01:21.965 --> 02:01:32.155]  And again, a 1 carat diamond out of South Africa, $5, and then by the time somebody buys it here in Austin, Texas, $5,000, that's quite a markup.
[02:01:33.016 --> 02:01:35.879]  It's a markup, and that's why they don't want people to know about it.
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:42.906]  And as you said in the last hour, Janine, their business isn't diamond mining, it is the monopoly over the diamonds.
[02:01:43.638 --> 02:01:48.442]  Their business is control the market, ration them out one by one onto the market.
[02:01:49.163 --> 02:01:53.987]  A customer comes and they say... They say, is there anyone like this in the world?
[02:01:54.067 --> 02:01:56.449]  And it's worth $5,000, $6,000, $8,000.
[02:01:57.770 --> 02:02:00.413]  But behind their back, they've got another thousand of them.
[02:02:01.514 --> 02:02:03.295]  Next customer, and they bring us another one.
[02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:04.857]  Is there anyone like it in the world?
[02:02:04.877 --> 02:02:06.018]  And they sell that one to you.
[02:02:07.019 --> 02:02:08.520]  You know the naive customer.
[02:02:09.321 --> 02:02:10.722]  And it carries on like this.
[02:02:12.230 --> 02:02:14.454]  And De Beers calls it duck feeding.
[02:02:15.595 --> 02:02:18.400]  It's like feeding ducks with diamonds.
[02:02:19.041 --> 02:02:20.603]  They're a really arrogant company.
[02:02:22.005 --> 02:02:25.611]  They're laughing at you, and again, this is a microcosm of the rest of the economy.
[02:02:26.158 --> 02:02:27.300]  It's not communist.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:28.201]  It's not fascist.
[02:02:28.261 --> 02:02:29.543]  It's command and control.
[02:02:29.943 --> 02:02:31.365]  It's about controlling markets.
[02:02:31.786 --> 02:02:33.168]  That's what globalism is about.
[02:02:33.208 --> 02:02:35.250]  These cartels running the planet.
[02:02:35.591 --> 02:02:41.299]  We'll come back, take a few more calls for our guest, Janine Roberts, joining us from her boat off the coast of England.
[02:02:41.319 --> 02:02:41.939]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.729 --> 02:02:50.076]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.236 --> 02:02:54.683]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.843 --> 02:02:59.229]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.269 --> 02:03:00.651]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.392 --> 02:03:02.352]  Panama.
[02:03:02.392 --> 02:03:06.614]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.674 --> 02:03:13.616]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.736 --> 02:03:15.816]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.117 --> 02:03:26.500]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:27.500]  If you want to understand
[02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:28.021]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:05:46.042 --> 02:05:48.144]  Ease the T-Rex in political talk.
[02:05:48.705 --> 02:05:51.607]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.829 --> 02:05:55.150]  I've always hated bullies.
[02:05:55.210 --> 02:05:57.312]  I've always disliked scam artists.
[02:05:59.071 --> 02:06:01.432]  Those that engage in unjust weights and measures.
[02:06:02.012 --> 02:06:05.153]  Diamonds are really semi-precious stones.
[02:06:06.353 --> 02:06:07.333]  Diamonds are plentiful.
[02:06:07.513 --> 02:06:09.414]  Huge mines have been found all over the planet.
[02:06:10.334 --> 02:06:14.415]  But people are paying tens of thousands of dollars for their wedding rings, their engagement rings.
[02:06:15.115 --> 02:06:18.456]  And you'll still go out, you'll still have to have it because of the marketing campaign.
[02:06:19.136 --> 02:06:27.698]  And then they send in mercenaries and killer forces, admittedly, to go in and take over countries where people are mining diamonds and not paying the beers they're cut or going through them.
[02:06:29.264 --> 02:06:31.786]  And you sit there and you put up with this, my friends.
[02:06:31.846 --> 02:06:37.071]  And it was set up, of course, by Cecil Rhodes, who is the architect of the current New World Order system we live under.
[02:06:38.572 --> 02:06:42.415]  We have huge diamond mines in this country that are shut off for environmental reasons.
[02:06:42.455 --> 02:06:43.496]  No one's allowed to have them.
[02:06:44.277 --> 02:06:47.419]  This is about the artificial scarcity that has been manufactured.
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:56.207]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air with our award-winning guest, Janine Roberts, the documentary filmmaker of Diamond Empire and the book Glitter and Greed.
[02:06:57.257 --> 02:07:03.722]  And her website is www.sparkle.bluf.com.
[02:07:04.183 --> 02:07:05.984]  Go ahead, Mike, you're on the air from Arizona.
[02:07:06.385 --> 02:07:06.725]  Hello, Ms.
[02:07:06.765 --> 02:07:07.145]  Roberts.
[02:07:07.766 --> 02:07:08.086]  Hi.
[02:07:08.907 --> 02:07:16.173]  I was wondering, have you traced the course of the diamond through the rest of the market?
[02:07:16.633 --> 02:07:18.034]  Where is the markup made?
[02:07:18.434 --> 02:07:20.076]  Is it by De Beers?
[02:07:21.237 --> 02:07:22.618]  What do the wholesalers pay?
[02:07:23.739 --> 02:07:26.581]  The vast amount of markup is at De Beers.
[02:07:27.682 --> 02:07:32.585]  Some of the other merchants at the lower down are only getting 5% and quite low markups.
[02:07:33.305 --> 02:07:36.487]  But retailers quite often put 100% on.
[02:07:37.527 --> 02:07:39.008]  Okay, so let's get this straight.
[02:07:39.448 --> 02:07:40.489]  And this is admitted, folks.
[02:07:40.549 --> 02:07:42.670]  My family's been low-level in this business.
[02:07:42.850 --> 02:07:48.533]  Just because we lived in Dallas, might have as friends and went to college with some of the Bull brothers from South Africa.
[02:07:48.573 --> 02:07:50.154]  I mean, I've known about this as a little kid.
[02:07:53.155 --> 02:07:54.116]  That's about right.
[02:07:54.516 --> 02:07:57.579]  There's a big markup right at the end of the retail and a gigantic markup at De Beers.
[02:08:18.243 --> 02:08:19.424]  All right, well thank you very much.
[02:08:19.484 --> 02:08:21.065]  Mike, you're asking good questions.
[02:08:21.105 --> 02:08:22.347]  Any other questions for her?
[02:08:22.607 --> 02:08:31.314]  Because this organization, Rothschilds, Oppenheimers, British Royalty, these are the people all right at the core of this system.
[02:08:32.795 --> 02:08:37.780]  Yeah, I'm sure these are people right at the apex of the New World Order pyramid, too.
[02:08:39.021 --> 02:08:40.922]  This is where the vast wealth is.
[02:08:43.028 --> 02:08:52.673]  No coincidence that Cecil Rhodes, of course, went to South Africa to control the gold and the diamond mines there and set up the Rhodes Scholarship.
[02:08:53.093 --> 02:08:54.334]  But does this anger you?
[02:08:54.374 --> 02:08:59.316]  I mean, most people already know diamonds are a monopoly, but this is the scam they're running on us!
[02:08:59.917 --> 02:09:06.440]  Well, if women are foolish enough, and fortunately my wife is included in there, to go for that,
[02:09:08.979 --> 02:09:21.248]  She knows full well that pubic zirconia is just as attractive and almost indistinguishable even by professional jewelers without pretty sophisticated equipment.
[02:09:22.529 --> 02:09:25.832]  But, you know, she will settle for nothing less than a real diamond.
[02:09:25.852 --> 02:09:35.039]  So, I mean... It goes both ways, because you get De Beers' adverts saying, you, the man, know to think big.
[02:09:36.374 --> 02:09:39.296]  I bought my wife a big diamond ring when we got married.
[02:09:39.337 --> 02:09:41.899]  It's seen as value and it's a ritual.
[02:09:41.939 --> 02:09:43.460]  It's a part of the cultural experience.
[02:09:57.171 --> 02:09:59.313]  But this story is very helpful because it
[02:10:27.370 --> 02:10:37.256]  For the men out there, this gives us ammunition to turn around and explain to the women that you're not getting something of lasting value, something that's going to appreciate with time.
[02:10:38.097 --> 02:10:39.678]  It's just a scam, really.
[02:10:40.238 --> 02:10:41.659]  Absolutely.
[02:10:42.059 --> 02:10:44.341]  People are trapped by the advertising.
[02:10:45.888 --> 02:10:47.648]  You don't want an unnatural stone, do you?
[02:10:47.668 --> 02:10:48.989]  You want a natural stone.
[02:10:49.089 --> 02:10:55.510]  Well, I mean, if you're going to give your wife something that's really valuable, wouldn't that be an emerald or a ruby?
[02:10:56.130 --> 02:10:57.370]  Yeah, they're better.
[02:10:58.871 --> 02:10:59.611]  Definitely better.
[02:11:00.631 --> 02:11:01.891]  I actually prefer them, too.
[02:11:02.091 --> 02:11:03.352]  That's just my personal taste.
[02:11:03.512 --> 02:11:08.653]  Well, I mean, aren't they actually much more precious than diamonds?
[02:11:09.273 --> 02:11:10.113]  They are more precious.
[02:11:10.153 --> 02:11:11.153]  They're rarer than diamonds.
[02:11:11.753 --> 02:11:12.713]  Much rarer than diamonds.
[02:11:13.314 --> 02:11:15.634]  And they don't have the same racket working in the trade.
[02:11:17.771 --> 02:11:21.073]  Yeah, so that's why they don't have all the big advertisements for emeralds and rubies.
[02:11:21.093 --> 02:11:24.354]  No, it's because diamonds are relatively common that they can run such a big racket.
[02:11:25.755 --> 02:11:26.135]  You know?
[02:11:26.716 --> 02:11:28.496]  I mean, I trace diamonds all over the world.
[02:11:28.536 --> 02:11:33.379]  They move on the same path internationally as ornaments, drug parade.
[02:11:33.979 --> 02:11:34.620]  They're moved out.
[02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:36.841]  There's so many secret paths.
[02:11:36.901 --> 02:11:37.881]  I was tracking them down.
[02:11:37.941 --> 02:11:40.042]  I was finding the Swiss recording.
[02:11:40.763 --> 02:11:42.463]  Most of their diamonds came from England.
[02:11:42.864 --> 02:11:47.306]  And the English customs were recording that they didn't send any hardly to Switzerland.
[02:11:48.346 --> 02:11:55.950]  And, you know, you just find that there's so much secretive nature of this trade.
[02:11:56.070 --> 02:11:58.891]  Well, also, I want to go, it's the intelligence agencies.
[02:11:58.931 --> 02:12:05.295]  I mean, Cecil Rhodes founded the Roundtable Group, which founded the OSS, which founded the CIA, and which controls narcotics.
[02:12:05.355 --> 02:12:11.057]  Yeah, and your last caller mentioned that, you know, Oppenheimer's also got control over the gold in South Africa.
[02:12:11.077 --> 02:12:12.178]  And that's true.
[02:12:12.838 --> 02:12:16.060]  They've also got control over most of the stock exchange in South Africa.
[02:12:16.966 --> 02:12:21.167]  And it's really put the South African government under a very difficult situation.
[02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:27.749]  Because if they talk of doing anything about it, they can have a run on the Stock Exchange in South Africa.
[02:12:27.849 --> 02:12:30.550]  I've got a question for you, and I'm sure Mike might want to comment on this.
[02:12:30.910 --> 02:12:40.473]  You talked about the Oppenheimers bragging, De Beers bragging, their cartel calling us ducks, duck feeding, feeding the mindless ducks with the diamonds.
[02:12:41.673 --> 02:12:44.234]  Where do you get these comments from where they arrogantly laugh at us?
[02:12:45.810 --> 02:12:49.914]  That comment came from a diamond merchant!
[02:12:50.194 --> 02:12:58.400]  I talk to a lot of people in the diamond trade because, believe it or not, there are quite a lot of diamond merchants that are very upset by what's happened to their industry and they want it purified.
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:12:59.541]  They want it cleaned.
[02:13:00.722 --> 02:13:05.586]  And I'm... My website's listed on some diamond merchants' websites.
[02:13:05.626 --> 02:13:07.347]  They direct people to talk to me.
[02:13:07.367 --> 02:13:14.493]  That's the diamond company that values diamonds for the Republic of South Africa.
[02:13:16.863 --> 02:13:20.245]  They believe that I'm not telling the whole truth, because I'm not telling enough.
[02:13:20.865 --> 02:13:23.946]  They said, if you only knew, Jan, you're only telling the tip of the iceberg.
[02:13:24.427 --> 02:13:26.588]  There's so much more happening.
[02:13:27.748 --> 02:13:34.172]  And then the globalists also use these diamonds for their own clandestine operations, just like they use narcotics money from all of this.
[02:13:35.052 --> 02:13:38.394]  And now they're going to make having diamonds that aren't their diamonds a crime.
[02:13:39.094 --> 02:13:39.855]  Mike, anything else?
[02:13:40.655 --> 02:13:44.377]  I'm curious, I'm not sure how much you know about the history of South Africa, but
[02:13:45.247 --> 02:13:55.858]  In South Africa and Rwanda, we're all being turned upside down, the governments, the white governments thrown out for favor of communist governments.
[02:13:57.159 --> 02:14:01.344]  De Beers and these companies seem to come through pretty much unfazed.
[02:14:01.784 --> 02:14:07.370]  Is that prima facie evidence that these companies were behind these revolutions?
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:16.364]  Well, the really upsetting thing, I've got several chapters of the book about the wars in Africa, showing the link to the diamond trade.
[02:14:18.505 --> 02:14:27.270]  After the end of colonization around the 1960s, one of the first countries to become a democracy was Ghana, shortly followed by the Congo.
[02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:34.934]  In both cases, governments were elected that were democratic, and in both cases the countries were overthrown
[02:14:35.689 --> 02:14:38.871]  In both cases, the overthrow was connected to the diamond industry.
[02:14:39.551 --> 02:14:41.772]  And they used communists to do their dirty work!
[02:14:42.312 --> 02:14:46.655]  I think there was a lot of conning here.
[02:14:46.675 --> 02:14:49.296]  People being called communists who weren't communists.
[02:14:49.796 --> 02:14:50.697]  No, I understand that.
[02:14:50.717 --> 02:14:59.561]  Yeah, President Nakamura of Ghana was saying, telling President Kennedy, look, I'm no communist, I just believe I need to talk to both sides to make my own mind up.
[02:15:00.462 --> 02:15:02.903]  So I'm talking to the Russians, but I'm also talking to you, and I'm
[02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:04.671]  No, all for democracy.
[02:15:04.891 --> 02:15:06.191]  I'm just talking to them, that's all.
[02:15:06.692 --> 02:15:07.852]  See what they've got to say for themselves.
[02:15:07.872 --> 02:15:08.192]  Alright.
[02:15:08.492 --> 02:15:12.634]  Well, uh, Mike... What Ghana did was they took the diamonds away from De Beers.
[02:15:13.275 --> 02:15:17.037]  They said, why should an apartheid regime be marketing diamonds?
[02:15:17.437 --> 02:15:24.220]  And they set up in a city called Praha, near Accra, their own independent diamond market.
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:30.323]  Well, let me ask you a question... Shortly after this, you had this diamond merchant arrive from Fifth Avenue, uh, Tempestman,
[02:15:31.542 --> 02:15:38.224]  And shortly after that you had a coup organized through Morris Templeton's office against this Democratic elected president.
[02:15:38.364 --> 02:15:39.905]  Well let me bring something up current.
[02:15:40.205 --> 02:15:49.068]  Margaret Thatcher's son was just arrested in South Africa and now it's heard it on the nightly news, but they're even admitting it, connected to the CIA in their trying to overthrow countries.
[02:15:49.848 --> 02:15:51.489]  Oh God, I know this guy.
[02:15:51.749 --> 02:15:56.431]  The son's been infamous because he's been an investigative journalist like me for 30 odd years.
[02:15:57.191 --> 02:15:59.372]  Mark's name has surfaced all over the place.
[02:15:59.452 --> 02:16:00.292]  It was in Chile.
[02:16:00.822 --> 02:16:02.625]  Join the time of the dictatorship in Chile.
[02:16:04.307 --> 02:16:13.139]  He's been connected to arms deals allegedly all over the place and we've all been trying to find out more what he's doing, what he's up to.
[02:16:14.697 --> 02:16:17.258]  I've been for a long time, I've got a long track record.
[02:16:17.318 --> 02:16:18.659]  Alright, Mike, thank you for the call.
[02:16:18.679 --> 02:16:22.020]  We're going to come back and take other people's calls and let our guest go.
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:25.441]  Janine Roberts, thank you so much for coming on.
[02:16:25.461 --> 02:16:26.982]  The book, Glitter and Greed.
[02:16:27.422 --> 02:16:29.642]  You also have the video, Diamond Empire, on your website.
[02:16:30.003 --> 02:16:32.463]  Can folks get Glitter and Greed in major bookstores?
[02:16:33.024 --> 02:16:34.744]  Yeah, you can get it in the major bookstores.
[02:16:34.844 --> 02:16:37.605]  It's on Amazon and Barnes & Noble and all those as well.
[02:16:38.346 --> 02:16:42.107]  It's just got refuge in England in the Independent Newspaper.
[02:16:42.569 --> 02:16:43.290]  I was critical afterwards.
[02:16:43.330 --> 02:16:44.350]  I had a complication.
[02:16:44.730 --> 02:16:45.331]  I got blood clots.
[02:17:03.169 --> 02:17:03.870]  Yeah, get the book.
[02:17:03.890 --> 02:17:05.152]  It's got so many stories in it.
[02:17:21.875 --> 02:17:24.817]  It's been 10 years of research I've put into this.
[02:17:25.097 --> 02:17:25.458]  Alright.
[02:17:25.858 --> 02:17:27.819]  Well, you're one of the premier experts.
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:32.383]  Yeah, I've got a lot of experts in different countries trying to get the truth out.
[02:17:32.543 --> 02:17:32.743]  Yes.
[02:17:33.023 --> 02:17:34.805]  Thank you for joining us and take care.

[02:20:55.242 --> 02:20:59.645]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:20:59.926 --> 02:21:09.754]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:21:10.515 --> 02:21:14.179]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:21:14.519 --> 02:21:16.982]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:21:17.002 --> 02:21:23.229]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:21:23.469 --> 02:21:24.991]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:21:25.291 --> 02:21:26.172]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:21:26.272 --> 02:21:29.254]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:21:29.414 --> 02:21:32.576]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:21:33.277 --> 02:21:35.959]  That's 800-255-1912.
[02:21:36.039 --> 02:21:40.102]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:21:40.242 --> 02:21:41.262]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:21:41.282 --> 02:21:51.770]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.410 --> 02:21:54.672]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:55.829 --> 02:22:02.571]  Alright, John and Fred and Maggie and Rich and everybody else, we're going to get to your calls.
[02:22:02.591 --> 02:22:08.633]  We've got a ton of news about Patriot Act 2 with the Supernational ID card being passed in the Senate.
[02:22:10.233 --> 02:22:14.254]  Adding all the horrible provisions that could be passed in the House any day now.
[02:22:15.094 --> 02:22:17.295]  Just massive news about the tyranny.
[02:22:18.195 --> 02:22:18.875]  Just incredible.
[02:22:19.216 --> 02:22:20.596]  And I want to go to your calls right now.
[02:22:21.340 --> 02:22:24.763]  But why did I spend the last hour and 20 minutes on the diamond trade?
[02:22:25.283 --> 02:22:26.504]  Because it's like everything else!
[02:22:26.804 --> 02:22:42.577]  Here's this world-renowned expert, who produced this huge TV show, has written this best-selling book, being beat up, being attacked, her film's been out for 6-7 years, they never sued her, they just threatened her, and it's all admitted, and you're a diamond, you paid $5,000 to work off of them $5!
[02:22:42.857 --> 02:22:45.960]  The things are just laying all over the place in giant piles!
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.402]  The Diamond Cartel sounds a lot like the Petroleum Cartel.
[02:22:49.422 --> 02:22:50.703]  Gasoline costs 5 cents a gallon in Iraq.
[02:23:08.424 --> 02:23:10.807]  $2 a gallon here and $5 a gallon in Europe.
[02:23:11.047 --> 02:23:19.755]  I actually read in a Wall Street Journal article a few years ago, to put a gallon into an entire 50-gallon drum, it cost them two cents.
[02:23:21.277 --> 02:23:28.003]  We've got oil wells gushing out of the ground here in Knoxville, Tennessee with a 100% drill rate, success rate.
[02:23:28.123 --> 02:23:32.948]  So, you know, it's black gold, Texas tea, Tennessee tea, it's everybody's tea.
[02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:43.924]  But again, it's just like De Beers, it's all about having a monopoly and advertisements about artificial scarcity with all the little propaganda minions out spouting it.
[02:23:44.885 --> 02:23:54.369]  Well, changing the subject, you mentioned that a campaign office of Bush and Cheney was allegedly hit by a drive-by shooting in Knoxville, Tennessee yesterday.
[02:23:55.470 --> 02:24:00.732]  Last month, a retired FBI agent was promoted to Knoxville's Chief of Police.
[02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:05.493]  He's never been a police officer before, and now he's in charge of 500 cops.
[02:24:06.494 --> 02:24:19.064]  Now, you've reported that the FBI was caught bombing the World Trade Center in 1993, confessed in court documents on audio tapes by their informant, who they paid a million dollars to make the bomb and blow it up.
[02:24:19.805 --> 02:24:26.910]  Then, of course, the FBI, you know, machine-gunned all the Christians at the Waco Church, and was involved in Oklahoma City and 9-1-1.
[02:24:28.422 --> 02:24:35.829]  I'm thinking this thing in Knoxville's got at least a 50-50 chance of being an Operation Northwoods bogus terror event.
[02:24:36.449 --> 02:24:43.896]  Well, I know Operation Northwoods calls for that, so the official government plan... Well, they're trying to call this... They're saying it might be a hate crime.
[02:24:45.583 --> 02:24:49.387]  Well, it might have been some, you know, drunken idiot Democrat.
[02:24:49.847 --> 02:24:59.456]  I mean, but this thing in Orlando where a bunch of Democrats run in laughing and scribble something on a poster and dump letters of people that don't like Bush on the floor and they're now saying it may be terrorism.
[02:24:59.916 --> 02:25:02.638]  I think it sounds like a provocateur type thing.
[02:25:03.679 --> 02:25:05.841]  It sounds a bit too over the top.
[02:25:07.643 --> 02:25:09.805]  So I would highly suspect that
[02:25:10.598 --> 02:25:17.100]  That they had something to do with it, or just made the whole thing up and just report it, because the media here... Well, that's the problem.
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:17.880]  ...like to do that.
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:18.980]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:20.020]  We've got a criminal government.
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:20.880]  You don't know what to believe.
[02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:21.661]  Thanks for the call, John.
[02:25:22.301 --> 02:25:24.281]  Fred in Philadelphia, you're up next.
[02:25:24.301 --> 02:25:24.961]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:25:26.342 --> 02:25:26.622]  Alex.
[02:25:26.922 --> 02:25:27.142]  Yes.
[02:25:27.522 --> 02:25:39.345]  I want to endorse that caller from Texas' point about the Guggenheims and the fact that the book... I'm reading a book about Zapata and
[02:25:42.313 --> 02:25:50.860]  There was a company that had more than 80% of Mexico's mining fields before the Mexican Revolution.
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:55.864]  You had also the phenomenon in Mexico of debt slavery.
[02:25:56.725 --> 02:26:06.113]  You had people that could not support themselves after they were kicked off their land, and they had to then work for whatever was offered, which was
[02:26:06.778 --> 02:26:09.279]  Not enough to stay alive unless people borrow.
[02:26:09.299 --> 02:26:12.420]  Yeah, and that's what they've done all over the globe, and that's what they're going to do here.
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:16.561]  Where, oh, you have bad credit, so you've got a yellow writing on your national ID card.
[02:26:16.581 --> 02:26:22.803]  You've got to go work 10-20 hours a week for a designated corporation, and the government pays off your debt for you.
[02:26:23.583 --> 02:26:28.285]  Also, old people, sick people having their houses taken now for medical bills.
[02:26:28.505 --> 02:26:32.166]  That shouldn't be allowed, but that's going on all over this country.
[02:26:32.646 --> 02:26:34.467]  And the other thing is that the
[02:26:35.103 --> 02:26:47.988]  The hallmark of these, especially the international monopoly, the companies that handle monopoly of a product is, along with the other things that you mentioned, violence.
[02:26:48.809 --> 02:26:56.552]  You had Rockefeller and the South Improvement Corporation, which did that sweating of rivals.
[02:26:56.632 --> 02:27:01.114]  They would simply not allow rivals to exist, and if they did,
[02:27:02.257 --> 02:27:06.079]  Uh, stay in business, they do more than simply compete with them economically.
[02:27:06.119 --> 02:27:10.301]  We know all about the, uh, the violence that they employed with that.
[02:27:10.661 --> 02:27:12.762]  Well, I mean, it goes back to Pinkerton's security.
[02:27:12.902 --> 02:27:15.523]  People wouldn't sell their piece of property to the railroad.
[02:27:16.343 --> 02:27:24.547]  Uh, train would pull up with a bunch of Pinkerton troops, machine gun men, women, and children, blow small children's heads off by the hundreds and laugh about it.
[02:27:25.187 --> 02:27:27.368]  And who runs the New World Order today?
[02:27:27.388 --> 02:27:27.869]  Security?
[02:27:27.909 --> 02:27:28.349]  Pinkerton.
[02:27:28.829 --> 02:27:30.710]  The history of slaughtering children and women and men.
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:32.260]  Ah, great points.
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:33.901]  Yeah, the government's real nice, folks.
[02:27:36.162 --> 02:27:37.083]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.563 --> 02:27:39.164]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.084 --> 02:27:42.865]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.967 --> 02:27:47.468]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:27:47.648 --> 02:27:48.808]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:27:48.948 --> 02:27:52.390]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:52.470 --> 02:27:52.950]  Phenol?
[02:27:53.230 --> 02:28:00.314]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:28:00.854 --> 02:28:04.738]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:28:04.838 --> 02:28:05.298]  Fragrance?
[02:28:05.679 --> 02:28:10.423]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:10.564 --> 02:28:15.268]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[02:28:15.488 --> 02:28:17.971]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[02:28:18.291 --> 02:28:21.692]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:28:21.852 --> 02:28:25.413]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:28:25.593 --> 02:28:27.974]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:28:28.114 --> 02:28:29.014]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:28:29.114 --> 02:28:38.856]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Kalben Pure Soaps.
[02:28:39.056 --> 02:28:41.537]  Call Kalben toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit KalbenPureSoap.com.
[02:28:46.169 --> 02:28:52.412]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:52.532 --> 02:28:58.696]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.996 --> 02:29:07.420]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:14.684]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.984 --> 02:29:19.827]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:20.027 --> 02:29:25.451]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.791 --> 02:29:28.873]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:29.194 --> 02:29:37.159]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.199 --> 02:29:37.779]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.745 --> 02:29:48.786]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[02:29:49.166 --> 02:29:51.688]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:29:51.908 --> 02:29:58.972]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:29:59.172 --> 02:30:02.454]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:30:02.714 --> 02:30:04.755]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:30:05.075 --> 02:30:12.900]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering the lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:14.441]  Either way, why chance it?
[02:30:14.541 --> 02:30:24.508]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[02:30:35.895 --> 02:30:36.095]  That's 877-835-5555.
[02:30:43.302 --> 02:30:44.451]  Seamineral.com
[02:30:52.685 --> 02:31:01.488]  Alright, we're 33 minutes into this third hour of this worldwide broadcast against tyranny.
[02:31:02.068 --> 02:31:07.290]  I'm Alex Jones, and we're going to have time for Maggie, Rick, Bob, and Fred.
[02:31:07.330 --> 02:31:13.072]  That'll be it for calls, because I've got a bunch of other news I just want to at least mention and go into a little bit in detail.
[02:31:13.492 --> 02:31:19.174]  Organ stealing in Colorado by a hospital's coroner calling it murder, calling it homicide.
[02:31:20.295 --> 02:31:23.478]  We've got the new Patriot Act 2.5.
[02:31:24.118 --> 02:31:25.479]  New developments there in the Senate.
[02:31:25.519 --> 02:31:27.301]  McCain getting it passed out of committee.
[02:31:27.741 --> 02:31:28.722]  Very serious stuff.
[02:31:29.143 --> 02:31:32.926]  For the next five minutes or so, though, we are honored to be joined by one of our great sponsors.
[02:31:33.266 --> 02:31:35.008]  Comes on about once a month with us or so.
[02:31:35.048 --> 02:31:35.889]  He's Dave Shibley.
[02:31:36.429 --> 02:31:39.693]  He's the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in the nation.
[02:31:40.033 --> 02:31:43.456]  I bought storable foods before and I was pleased with them, but from another company.
[02:31:43.897 --> 02:31:49.643]  I got these and the quality of them is just heads, tails, you know, above the rest it is.
[02:31:51.758 --> 02:31:52.718]  Amazing stuff.
[02:31:53.299 --> 02:31:54.559]  And the prices.
[02:31:55.039 --> 02:31:57.460]  And this is all made in America, grown in America.
[02:31:57.900 --> 02:31:58.981]  They can it themselves.
[02:31:59.241 --> 02:32:00.321]  Super high quality.
[02:32:01.122 --> 02:32:02.402]  And there's so many reasons.
[02:32:02.422 --> 02:32:05.884]  The economy is imploding, regardless of what they say.
[02:32:06.564 --> 02:32:07.664]  There's so many dangers.
[02:32:07.704 --> 02:32:09.045]  They're geared up for martial law.
[02:32:09.165 --> 02:32:10.325]  I don't know if that's going to happen.
[02:32:10.645 --> 02:32:12.226]  But it's an insurance policy you can eat.
[02:32:12.546 --> 02:32:15.807]  If in a couple years everything's fine, eat your insurance policy.
[02:32:16.928 --> 02:32:19.649]  Okay, I got two one-year food supplies.
[02:32:20.436 --> 02:32:20.777]  Okay.
[02:32:20.877 --> 02:32:21.518]  From these people.
[02:32:22.238 --> 02:32:23.440]  And I am so pleased.
[02:32:23.860 --> 02:32:24.782]  They're amazing folks.
[02:32:25.703 --> 02:32:27.084]  Dave Sibley, good to have you on with us.
[02:32:27.365 --> 02:32:27.685]  Good.
[02:32:27.785 --> 02:32:28.606]  Nice talking to you, Alex.
[02:32:28.626 --> 02:32:28.947]  How you doing?
[02:32:30.016 --> 02:32:30.517]  Good, sir.
[02:32:31.958 --> 02:32:35.540]  You've got your own reasons you think people ought to get prepared and have some storable foods.
[02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:38.462]  We buy life insurance, we buy auto insurance, house insurance.
[02:32:38.822 --> 02:32:39.763]  Why not have food?
[02:32:39.803 --> 02:32:45.987]  I mean, even in rural areas, if you don't grow all your own food, things could break down in just a matter of days.
[02:32:46.347 --> 02:32:48.108]  Society could go into turmoil.
[02:32:48.388 --> 02:32:49.649]  Food prices could triple.
[02:32:49.929 --> 02:32:51.670]  This is something we've got to do.
[02:32:51.690 --> 02:32:53.732]  That's exactly right.
[02:32:54.645 --> 02:32:59.508]  Well, case in point, the last gas shortage was caused by about a 5% disruption in flow.
[02:33:00.788 --> 02:33:05.031]  The world demand for oil right now is about 81 million barrels a day.
[02:33:05.251 --> 02:33:11.574]  The oil production globally is maxed out and demand is going higher and higher and higher.
[02:33:11.955 --> 02:33:14.676]  Could you imagine if something disastrous happened?
[02:33:14.916 --> 02:33:17.838]  Say the terrorists shut down Saudi Arabia for one month.
[02:33:19.352 --> 02:33:22.517]  Fuel would probably go to $6-$8 again when you'd be standing in line.
[02:33:23.439 --> 02:33:24.801]  Everything would grind to a halt.
[02:33:24.861 --> 02:33:26.644]  And that's going to make food prices double?
[02:33:27.445 --> 02:33:28.768]  More than double if you could get it!
[02:33:29.525 --> 02:33:31.966]  Back to the old saying, I'm sure everybody's heard it.
[02:33:32.066 --> 02:33:33.487]  If you got it, a truck brought it.
[02:33:33.547 --> 02:33:34.908]  Well, trucks don't run unless they have fuel.
[02:33:34.948 --> 02:33:41.611]  Well, look, I'm not being gloom and doom, but folks, the government's saying we will have terror attacks before or after the election.
[02:33:41.691 --> 02:33:42.451]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:33:42.911 --> 02:33:47.153]  I know that I increased my food supply, okay?
[02:33:47.213 --> 02:33:49.995]  And I'm very pleased, and you need to give Dave Sibley a call.
[02:33:50.035 --> 02:33:53.116]  But Dave, what are some of the other reasons folks should get some affordable foods?
[02:33:53.136 --> 02:33:57.138]  Well, I've learned, it took me most of my life to figure out to follow the money.
[02:33:58.365 --> 02:34:03.752]  Financially, our government's fiscal policies are retarded.
[02:34:04.473 --> 02:34:06.676]  They're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
[02:34:07.136 --> 02:34:10.661]  The country's going in a hole approximately two billion dollars a day.
[02:34:11.342 --> 02:34:15.267]  If they can keep the lid on this until after the election, there'll be no need to lie.
[02:34:15.908 --> 02:34:16.688]  Two billion a day.
[02:34:16.708 --> 02:34:23.590]  Do you have any idea how much... You, me, and all the listeners that listen to this program could not count that much money in a day.
[02:34:23.610 --> 02:34:28.051]  And they say the high-tech layoffs are going to get seven times worse in the next four years.
[02:34:28.831 --> 02:34:30.291]  They're accelerating all of this.
[02:34:30.331 --> 02:34:30.952]  It's simple.
[02:34:31.452 --> 02:34:33.332]  How long do these storable foods last?
[02:34:33.492 --> 02:34:36.953]  Properly stored, you can get ten years out of them comfortably, and beyond that.
[02:34:37.793 --> 02:34:41.154]  So again, folks, it's simple, and we're talking
[02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:53.643]  $1,295 for a year food supply, normally $14.95, and that's a low price, plus shipping at $12.95 and no shipping charge, folks.
[02:34:54.143 --> 02:35:07.946]  And the truck pulled up at my house, backed right up to my garage, nice guy unloaded it all, week and a half after I ordered it, very impressive food packages, and you guys put this together yourselves, this is all from right here in America.
[02:35:08.206 --> 02:35:09.387]  All of it but the banana chips.
[02:35:09.427 --> 02:35:11.988]  We'd buy them here, but there's just no bananas made in this country.
[02:35:12.968 --> 02:35:13.488]  That's right.
[02:35:13.709 --> 02:35:14.929]  We buy them from the Philippines.
[02:35:14.969 --> 02:35:18.911]  We've been buying from this supplier now for a quarter of a century.
[02:35:19.011 --> 02:35:22.072]  How about somebody that doesn't have 1,200 bucks?
[02:35:22.453 --> 02:35:23.553]  Well, we have a special.
[02:35:23.993 --> 02:35:24.934]  We've been noticing that.
[02:35:25.334 --> 02:35:26.034]  People are broke.
[02:35:26.074 --> 02:35:26.955]  We both know that, Alex.
[02:35:27.595 --> 02:35:30.336]  We have a one-month supply for two adults.
[02:35:30.376 --> 02:35:35.098]  That's 30 days for two adults shipped anywhere in the U.S., continental U.S., for $199.
[02:35:36.767 --> 02:35:42.683]  And again, I'm going to be honest, I've got a family and we try to not buy the most expensive foods.
[02:35:42.703 --> 02:35:44.227]  $200 a week, conservatively, folks.
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:47.962]  I mean, it's just the food is getting more and more expensive.
[02:35:48.482 --> 02:35:51.664]  And imagine a month's supply for two adults for how much?
[02:35:51.684 --> 02:35:52.765]  $199 shipped anywhere in the continental U.S.
[02:35:52.785 --> 02:35:53.246]  I mean, come on, folks.
[02:35:53.346 --> 02:35:53.826]  That is a great deal.
[02:35:53.846 --> 02:35:54.366]  Give them a call right now.
[02:35:54.386 --> 02:35:54.446]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:35:54.466 --> 02:35:54.526]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:35:54.566 --> 02:35:57.749]  Or ReadyReserveFood.com and tell them Alex Jones sent you to take advantage of these specials.
[02:35:57.769 --> 02:35:57.829]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:36:15.621 --> 02:36:19.789]  I'm living out here in Southern California, ground zero, where it's all happening.
[02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:22.614]  We're having emergency rooms going broke.
[02:36:22.634 --> 02:36:24.858]  They're closing them down left and right.
[02:36:25.018 --> 02:36:26.561]  The system is overwhelmed.
[02:36:27.336 --> 02:36:28.857]  The hospitals aren't getting paid.
[02:36:30.197 --> 02:36:32.218]  You're talking about things imploding.
[02:36:32.518 --> 02:36:34.859]  I've seen stories of them shutting down libraries.
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:35.740]  Pardon me?
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:37.921]  I've seen stories of them shutting down libraries.
[02:36:38.801 --> 02:36:44.344]  I could go the rest of my life without a library, but I sure like having an emergency room open.
[02:36:44.364 --> 02:36:46.945]  Folks, it's happening.
[02:36:47.005 --> 02:36:49.886]  No matter who wins, we lose in this election.
[02:36:52.080 --> 02:37:01.710]  The numbers are so big and so, as I said before, retarded, we cannot continue what we're doing for maybe six more months if nothing happens.
[02:37:02.170 --> 02:37:10.879]  Well, I mean, regardless, folks, ten year, you know, the last ten years, and it's a great deal, and I got two of these $1,200 packages.
[02:37:10.919 --> 02:37:11.819]  I mean, you cannot
[02:37:15.077 --> 02:37:16.458]  You cannot find a better deal.
[02:37:16.599 --> 02:37:19.141]  I've looked at it, and I hope you take advantage of it.
[02:37:19.161 --> 02:37:20.542]  Dave Sibley, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:37:20.562 --> 02:37:21.083]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:37:21.543 --> 02:37:22.604]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:37:23.225 --> 02:37:26.048]  And here's that number if you missed it, 800-453-2202.
[02:37:26.268 --> 02:37:33.855]  You know, I'm not into magic creams that heal everything, or magic machines that heal you, or UFOs, or any of that.
[02:37:33.915 --> 02:37:34.896]  I'm into real things.
[02:37:35.357 --> 02:37:38.540]  The Second Amendment we defend, the national sovereignty, the family.
[02:37:39.641 --> 02:37:44.845]  The free flow, the free press and information, your First Amendment, the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:37:44.905 --> 02:37:48.008]  I make documentary films and write books and have websites.
[02:37:48.368 --> 02:37:50.169]  We're just about information and real things.
[02:37:50.890 --> 02:37:55.594]  I've gotten food from these guys and I am extremely, extremely impressed.
[02:37:56.754 --> 02:38:00.757]  And I've gotten a lot of other feedback from people who have gotten it from them who are impressed too, so I'm glad to hear that.
[02:38:02.038 --> 02:38:02.959]  So take advantage of it.
[02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:05.601]  I mean, it's a good feeling to have that food.
[02:38:06.081 --> 02:38:07.723]  A good feeling to have the firearms.
[02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:11.331]  It's a good feeling to have water filters.
[02:38:11.391 --> 02:38:14.412]  It's a good feeling to have an all-terrain, four-wheel drive vehicle.
[02:38:15.252 --> 02:38:17.913]  It's a good feeling to have places I can go to if I need to.
[02:38:18.593 --> 02:38:20.594]  We're not the ones saying all this bad stuff is going to happen.
[02:38:20.634 --> 02:38:22.534]  It's the government saying it.
[02:38:22.554 --> 02:38:25.355]  1-800-453-2202 or ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[02:38:25.455 --> 02:38:28.356]  All right, let's go to some calls real quick here and then back to the news.
[02:38:28.756 --> 02:38:29.717]  Maggie in Texas.
[02:38:29.777 --> 02:38:30.797]  Maggie, you're on the air.
[02:38:30.837 --> 02:38:31.157]  Welcome.
[02:38:31.477 --> 02:38:31.877]  Hi, Alex.
[02:38:31.917 --> 02:38:34.158]  Just two points and I'll try to make them quick.
[02:38:35.498 --> 02:38:36.879]  I remember as a
[02:38:37.987 --> 02:38:40.047]  Second or third grader learning U.S.
[02:38:40.207 --> 02:38:48.429]  geography out of a very old textbook that listed diamonds as a product of Arkansas right alongside aluminum ore and wristwatches.
[02:38:48.749 --> 02:38:52.889]  Giant surface and deep diamond mines all over the state.
[02:38:53.130 --> 02:39:02.071]  One gigantic huge one that friends of our family owned and they were forced to give it up because De Beers didn't want anybody being able to dig diamonds out of it.
[02:39:02.151 --> 02:39:05.212]  My dad went to college with the Bull brothers from South Africa.
[02:39:05.232 --> 02:39:07.292]  They were French and in
[02:39:08.624 --> 02:39:08.804]  I don't
[02:39:26.545 --> 02:39:29.426]  Even though he graduated at the top of his class, he just had to go out and get another job.
[02:39:29.866 --> 02:39:33.528]  And the Bull brothers, one of them hired him because in the diamond business, everything is trust.
[02:39:33.848 --> 02:39:38.630]  That's why a lot of Jews at the low level of the diamond business are involved, because it's a trust thing.
[02:39:39.210 --> 02:39:40.611]  It's a kind of hereditary deal.
[02:39:40.831 --> 02:39:41.551]  They can trust each other.
[02:39:41.571 --> 02:39:42.231]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:39:42.472 --> 02:39:43.652]  They had to find a way they could trust them.
[02:39:43.672 --> 02:39:48.034]  My dad would just carry diamonds around a few times a month and get a small percentage.
[02:39:48.294 --> 02:39:50.735]  But he went to their house and ate dinner, and they came to our house.
[02:39:50.815 --> 02:39:52.676]  And some of these guys are billionaires now.
[02:39:53.436 --> 02:39:55.377]  But they were good friends of the family.
[02:39:55.977 --> 02:39:57.298]  And they would just talk about it.
[02:39:57.438 --> 02:39:59.598]  Oh, these, you know, the Oppenheimers.
[02:39:59.638 --> 02:40:01.279]  Man, they sent in their troops again.
[02:40:01.319 --> 02:40:03.380]  You know, they're trying to do this and that.
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:07.581]  And so I knew about all of this and now we're seeing it happen again.
[02:40:08.061 --> 02:40:13.943]  And those diamond mines, you know, should be sold to a private company by the government or should be given to the people.
[02:40:13.983 --> 02:40:17.444]  But no, we can't have our diamonds just like we can't have our oil out of Alaska.
[02:40:17.484 --> 02:40:17.824]  Go ahead.
[02:40:17.844 --> 02:40:18.245]  Yes.
[02:40:20.007 --> 02:40:26.209]  About 8 or 10 years ago I finally got to the Crater of Diamonds, and in fact I've made a few tours there.
[02:40:26.769 --> 02:40:39.673]  On one occasion there was a kind of wild-eyed guy hanging around who didn't claim to have any financial stake in it, but insisted that this was a real diamond mine and it had been shut down by the De Beers.
[02:40:39.733 --> 02:40:47.675]  And of course at the time I didn't believe him, but now I'm smarter and you're doing a really good job of informing people on everything they need to know.
[02:40:48.257 --> 02:40:48.837]  Well, thank you.
[02:40:48.877 --> 02:40:49.538]  I appreciate the call.
[02:40:49.578 --> 02:40:50.058]  Anything else?
[02:40:51.279 --> 02:40:56.863]  Um, just that I have my grandma's diamond from 1915 and it's the only diamond I'll ever wear.
[02:40:57.803 --> 02:40:58.524]  Well, God bless you.
[02:40:58.564 --> 02:41:04.808]  I mean, obviously these are heirlooms and they're symbols of a people's love and I'm not saying diamonds are bad themselves.
[02:41:04.828 --> 02:41:09.151]  It's just that $5 for a one carat diamond that I'll pay $5,000 for.
[02:41:09.271 --> 02:41:10.872]  Oh, that one will be forever.
[02:41:11.412 --> 02:41:12.493]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[02:41:13.189 --> 02:41:13.930]  I appreciate it.
[02:41:13.950 --> 02:41:27.298]  I remember when I was in the kindergarten and I climbed up on top of the sink, got into the medicine cabinet real quick, grabbed my great-grandmother's diamond.
[02:41:28.979 --> 02:41:30.240]  She was still alive at the time.
[02:41:31.441 --> 02:41:32.501]  She gave it to my mother.
[02:41:32.821 --> 02:41:36.544]  I took it to school and I gave it to a girl.
[02:41:37.504 --> 02:41:39.766]  Then I came home and said, I gave a girl a diamond.
[02:41:40.422 --> 02:41:42.924]  And my parents went to the family and said, give us that diamond back.
[02:41:42.944 --> 02:41:44.425]  And they said, oh, we lost it.
[02:41:44.605 --> 02:41:47.768]  Which I'm sure was probably true, but that just shows.
[02:41:48.008 --> 02:41:49.249]  My parents didn't even get very mad.
[02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:51.551]  They've never been really into possessions.
[02:41:52.912 --> 02:41:57.856]  I did get in trouble, though, that I wanted to gas the car up with the water hose.
[02:41:59.059 --> 02:42:04.643]  My dad said no right around that same time and then as soon as he turned his back I went ahead and put the water hose in the gas tank.
[02:42:05.303 --> 02:42:06.584]  That didn't make my dad too happy.
[02:42:07.244 --> 02:42:10.306]  But that's the kind of stuff I did.
[02:42:10.647 --> 02:42:12.168]  He got mad at that though.
[02:42:12.708 --> 02:42:14.809]  Because they had one car, I remember that.
[02:42:15.370 --> 02:42:18.252]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:42:18.312 --> 02:42:20.413]  Let's talk to Rick and Reno.
[02:42:20.973 --> 02:42:21.914]  Go ahead sir.
[02:42:22.454 --> 02:42:22.995]  Hi Alex.
[02:42:23.315 --> 02:42:23.735]  Hello.
[02:42:23.915 --> 02:42:27.718]  I commend you for your work and Miss Roberts, commend you for yours and your guts.
[02:42:29.062 --> 02:42:32.324]  Well, she got beat up for it, and that's real friendly.
[02:42:33.325 --> 02:42:40.269]  Now, I'd like to see her get out her film, and in order to do that, folks need to get the website address right.
[02:42:40.369 --> 02:42:45.132]  It's sparkle.plus, P-L-U-S.
[02:42:45.192 --> 02:42:47.773]  Her cell phone out on that boat was cracking up, I missed that.
[02:42:47.973 --> 02:42:50.575]  It's sparkle.plus.com.
[02:42:50.835 --> 02:42:52.176]  Plus, I thought you were saying plub.
[02:42:52.216 --> 02:42:55.058]  Yeah, sparkle.plus, P-L-U-S.com.
[02:42:55.118 --> 02:42:55.538]  Alright.
[02:42:55.918 --> 02:42:58.660]  And I have, before I go, a couple predictions for you.
[02:42:59.187 --> 02:42:59.507]  Okay.
[02:42:59.807 --> 02:43:12.250]  Number one, within the time it takes for folks to get her film in the mail, that's when you'll start seeing her film up on the file sharing networks and it'll get out to lots of people.
[02:43:13.211 --> 02:43:14.351]  That's prediction number one.
[02:43:14.791 --> 02:43:15.411]  Absolutely.
[02:43:15.511 --> 02:43:16.232]  Okay, number two.
[02:43:18.410 --> 02:43:20.251]  Bush can't afford another debate.
[02:43:20.432 --> 02:43:25.816]  I predict that there's going to be a manufactured terror threat in St.
[02:43:25.876 --> 02:43:30.219]  Louis, sufficient to cause them to postpone or cancel the debate.
[02:43:30.679 --> 02:43:31.600]  Well, I hope you're wrong.
[02:43:31.620 --> 02:43:37.164]  There could be something overseas, though, so he can stand up and say, look at the bombings in Turkey, you know, when he went to England.
[02:43:37.445 --> 02:43:40.547]  See, I told you, and it turned out it was the government, but so what?
[02:43:40.787 --> 02:43:41.628]  I hope I'm wrong, too.
[02:43:43.436 --> 02:43:47.037]  In a way, it's funny if they do manufacture a threat against St.
[02:43:47.077 --> 02:44:05.924]  Louis, because if you listen to dugout Dick Cheney there, in his Beltway Bunker, in his spider hole hiding place, the terrorists want to see Bush lose the debate and fail, so that the supposedly weaker Kerry can get in.
[02:44:07.276 --> 02:44:08.177]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:08.317 --> 02:44:09.278]  I mean, I know this.
[02:44:09.898 --> 02:44:16.603]  They say that the terrorists attacked us because they had our freedoms, and then they're getting rid of our freedoms, so I think the terrorists would love our government.
[02:44:17.043 --> 02:44:19.485]  Oh, they are the terrorists, so they do love our government.
[02:44:20.246 --> 02:44:22.507]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Texas.
[02:44:22.568 --> 02:44:23.448]  Bob, you're on the air.
[02:44:23.508 --> 02:44:23.828]  Welcome.
[02:44:24.309 --> 02:44:25.069]  How you doing today?
[02:44:25.270 --> 02:44:25.510]  Good.
[02:44:26.751 --> 02:44:29.593]  You know that everything, there are different levels of intrigue to everything?
[02:44:30.133 --> 02:44:30.393]  Yes.
[02:44:30.513 --> 02:44:34.176]  Well, the money part of the diamonds is actually just one of the last layers.
[02:44:35.837 --> 02:44:36.478]  Diamonds have
[02:44:37.406 --> 02:44:39.527]  Much better use in electronics.
[02:44:39.667 --> 02:44:44.468]  You can create electronic circuits using diamonds that cannot be destroyed by electromagnetic pulse.
[02:44:45.168 --> 02:44:52.550]  Yeah, I've read that on some of the submarines and some of the big command bases they got special diamond encrusted circuits.
[02:44:53.230 --> 02:45:00.373]  And there are also indications that diamonds can be used in propulsion systems using anti-gravity.
[02:45:00.693 --> 02:45:05.374]  So I don't think they would want those really too much out in the public domain where people could
[02:45:06.158 --> 02:45:09.441]  Experiment with them and find different means of propulsion, etc.
[02:45:09.481 --> 02:45:12.083]  Yeah, I don't want a bunch of cheap diamonds for research.
[02:45:12.463 --> 02:45:15.705]  Right, I think that may be one of the different, another layer to this.
[02:45:15.986 --> 02:45:17.387]  And the money is just one part of it.
[02:45:17.427 --> 02:45:18.427]  They make money off of it.
[02:45:18.527 --> 02:45:22.591]  They're also keeping it out of the hands of the common man for experimentation purposes.
[02:45:22.611 --> 02:45:24.632]  And again, a 1 carat diamond of high quality, $5.
[02:45:24.672 --> 02:45:24.912]  $5, folks.
[02:45:24.932 --> 02:45:26.714]  And you pay $5,000 for it.
[02:45:26.734 --> 02:45:27.554]  Unbelievable.
[02:45:27.794 --> 02:45:28.835]  Anything else?
[02:45:35.689 --> 02:45:35.849]  No.
[02:45:36.149 --> 02:45:39.190]  I think that's why they're keeping it out of circulation.
[02:45:39.210 --> 02:45:39.770]  I hear you.
[02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:40.490]  Thanks, Bob.
[02:45:40.810 --> 02:45:42.791]  Last call I'm going to take is I've got some news here.
[02:45:42.831 --> 02:45:43.591]  Fred in Arizona.
[02:45:43.611 --> 02:45:44.291]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:45:45.432 --> 02:45:45.832]  Hi, Alex.
[02:45:45.852 --> 02:45:46.992]  Thanks for letting me on your show.
[02:45:47.372 --> 02:45:56.794]  You know, I'm really pleased to see that video I saw advertised on your show, 9-1-1, the in-plane site.
[02:45:57.095 --> 02:46:02.276]  I've been sending that video to the families of the deceased soldiers that have died in
[02:46:03.425 --> 02:46:05.927]  Well, I think they should send that video.
[02:46:06.007 --> 02:46:06.667]  It's a great video.
[02:46:06.687 --> 02:46:15.072]  I think they should send 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and The Masters of Terror, and George Humphrey's video, and 9-11, The Great Illusion, and Eric Huffman's video as well to people.
[02:46:29.269 --> 02:46:30.030]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:46:30.251 --> 02:46:41.848]  By the way, the military people that I'm in contact with, this is all Air Force here in this place, they're just eating up the idea that it was a missile that hit the Pentagon and there's no evidence, no geographic evidence.
[02:46:41.888 --> 02:46:45.193]  Well, yeah, they had all these video cameras on hotels and...
[02:46:45.513 --> 02:46:48.594]  On the Pentagon, aimed right at where it happened, but they won't release those videos.
[02:46:48.935 --> 02:47:00.259]  The FBI went to hotels and businesses and grabbed them under national security, and I've got a long tape of TV and radio interviews where locals said, I saw a small plane at high speed fly right into the building.
[02:47:00.700 --> 02:47:06.062]  Yeah, the air-launched cruise missile, which by the way, you can see a photograph of that, if anyone's listening, sort of photograph that on
[02:47:06.923 --> 02:47:10.907]  The internet, just do a search on air launch cruise missile and here it comes.
[02:47:11.227 --> 02:47:12.148]  Okay, well thank you Alex.
[02:47:12.269 --> 02:47:14.691]  Hey, thank you for the call Fred, I really appreciate that.
[02:47:15.032 --> 02:47:19.997]  And anybody that wants my new video, American Dictators Documenting the Staged Election of 2004,
[02:47:21.599 --> 02:47:23.001]  It's an excellent new film we've made.

[02:48:20.498 --> 02:48:21.679]  You stand in the gap.
[02:48:21.699 --> 02:48:22.339]  You're on the front lines.
[02:48:32.282 --> 02:48:33.224]  You've got the power.
[02:48:33.304 --> 02:48:35.588]  If you take action against evil, it can't stand.
[02:48:35.948 --> 02:48:37.971]  So get my videos and other videos I carry.
[02:48:38.352 --> 02:48:39.995]  Get them out today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:40.275 --> 02:48:44.001]  We'll come back and blitz through a bunch of key news items in the final segment.
[02:48:44.021 --> 02:48:44.422]  Stay with us.
[02:48:45.945 --> 02:48:47.467]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.647 --> 02:48:50.731]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.871 --> 02:48:54.775]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.815 --> 02:48:59.040]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:03.185]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.305 --> 02:49:05.107]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.407 --> 02:49:08.610]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.650 --> 02:49:13.374]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.534 --> 02:49:16.577]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.757 --> 02:49:19.619]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:26.225]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.745 --> 02:49:30.550]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:49:30.930 --> 02:49:32.332]  Order your video today.

[02:51:49.173 --> 02:51:51.255]  Alright, we're back live.
[02:51:51.295 --> 02:51:52.896]  Going through some of the key news.
[02:51:52.956 --> 02:51:57.099]  CNN coroner removing man's organs was homicide, the coroner.
[02:52:13.349 --> 02:52:20.716]  In Western Colorado, a coroner said Monday that two hospitals allowed vital organs to be removed from a man before they had proven he was brain dead.
[02:52:21.777 --> 02:52:23.679]  So there you are, folks.
[02:52:23.739 --> 02:52:25.921]  Lawmakers weigh Farnborn as president.
[02:52:26.782 --> 02:52:33.045]  Senate Judiciary Committee headed up by Hatch is going to get rid of that law, 22nd Amendment, so Arnold can be President.
[02:52:33.085 --> 02:52:35.546]  That's on Infowars.com and PrisonPawn.com.
[02:52:35.926 --> 02:52:39.167]  McCain National ID secretly passed Senate on Friday.
[02:52:39.187 --> 02:52:48.591]  Senator John McCain's amendment, 3807 to the 9-11 Commission's Bill S-2845, was quietly passed late Friday afternoon by unanimous consent.
[02:52:48.912 --> 02:52:51.213]  However, much of the Senate had already left the weekend.
[02:52:51.633 --> 02:52:52.953]  Now it's going to go to the full House.
[02:52:52.973 --> 02:52:54.254]  It can pass any day.
[02:52:55.071 --> 02:52:55.912]  Very, very serious.
[02:52:56.332 --> 02:52:56.653]  The U.S.
[02:52:56.673 --> 02:53:01.998]  confronts sudden flu vaccine shortage because it's contaminated with live virus by the big U.K.
[02:53:02.038 --> 02:53:03.679]  maker that supplies half the U.S.
[02:53:03.719 --> 02:53:08.344]  and they're saying look for the super flu to hit and they're doing forced inoculation drills all over the country.
[02:53:08.364 --> 02:53:11.587]  Another hate crimes bill to muzzle Christians.
[02:53:11.687 --> 02:53:19.494]  This is the House of Representatives introduced by Democrats supported by Republicans and it would not allow you to criticize homosexual groups and it's been put into the
[02:53:20.879 --> 02:53:23.422]  Defense Authorization Bill, or HR 4200.
[02:53:23.662 --> 02:53:26.846]  See, it's all about defense, on having free speech.
[02:53:27.787 --> 02:53:31.190]  And, uh, inspectors conclude no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[02:53:31.711 --> 02:53:41.101]  A group hunting for manned weapons inside post-war Iraq is preparing to report that they've found no chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons, despite the neocons keep lying about that.
[02:53:41.141 --> 02:53:41.962]  And, hey, uh,
[02:53:43.099 --> 02:53:47.602]  Mr. Skull and Bones 2, Jerry says he wants to invade Iran.
[02:53:47.742 --> 02:53:48.623]  Oh, they're evil.
[02:53:48.683 --> 02:53:52.226]  So, you so-called liberals don't like Bush, but you should love Jerry then.
[02:53:53.146 --> 02:53:54.987]  It's like conservatives worshipping Arnold.
[02:53:55.047 --> 02:53:57.329]  I mean, what they stand for means nothing.
[02:53:57.369 --> 02:54:00.831]  It's all the R or D before their name.
[02:54:01.952 --> 02:54:04.094]  And these are just some of the
[02:54:05.248 --> 02:54:06.909]  Some of the articles that we have here.
[02:54:07.549 --> 02:54:10.270]  The House claims that they have crushed the military draft.
[02:54:10.290 --> 02:54:13.972]  They brought it up for a vote yesterday, 402 to 2, against it.
[02:54:14.392 --> 02:54:16.113]  But the draft boards have been set back up.
[02:54:16.133 --> 02:54:17.573]  They've got a bunch of other bills introduced.
[02:54:17.593 --> 02:54:21.655]  We've always said they're going to try a draft after the election.
[02:54:22.375 --> 02:54:23.496]  That's when this is coming.
[02:54:24.336 --> 02:54:25.857]  Not before the election.
[02:54:25.897 --> 02:54:27.858]  Everybody in the military has been told this is coming.
[02:54:27.898 --> 02:54:32.920]  And people who are currently in, who have already served their time, done their duty, are being forced to stay in.
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:39.665]  And others are being intimidated that we'll forcibly re-up you and send you to frontline combat if you don't voluntarily sign back up.
[02:54:39.705 --> 02:54:41.506]  And that's admitted right out of Colorado Springs.
[02:54:42.287 --> 02:54:49.152]  So again, this is all right out in the open, but they bring this up politically to kill it now, for now, to make you think they've done something.
[02:54:49.413 --> 02:54:57.799]  Just like last week, the House votes against the gun ban in D.C., but it means nothing because they knew it was going to fail in the Senate.
[02:54:57.859 --> 02:54:58.680]  Just amazing.
[02:54:59.389 --> 02:55:03.730]  You know, the type of stage stuff we see going on.
[02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:06.131]  Oil hits $51.48 at all-time peak.
[02:55:06.471 --> 02:55:08.931]  And they say it could hit $60 by the end of the year.
[02:55:08.971 --> 02:55:09.591]  Who knows?
[02:55:10.091 --> 02:55:12.072]  It's up 78% from a year ago.
[02:55:12.092 --> 02:55:13.832]  And who knows?
[02:55:13.872 --> 02:55:17.433]  It may be up over 100% in the prices here very soon.
[02:55:17.473 --> 02:55:20.034]  And the oil companies are all making record profits.
[02:55:20.054 --> 02:55:21.274]  And they've got plenty of oil folks.
[02:55:21.294 --> 02:55:22.534]  It's just like the Diamond Cartel.
[02:55:22.894 --> 02:55:24.015]  It's owned by the same people.
[02:55:24.395 --> 02:55:25.355]  It's a giant scam.
[02:55:26.310 --> 02:55:32.373]  So that's also some of the serious news information that we have for you today.
[02:55:32.974 --> 02:55:51.464]  Again, we'll be back tonight from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on the Global Shortwave at 3210 from 9 to midnight Central, during the day on the Shortwave at 9475, and on your local AM or FM station, of course, as well as InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:51.484 --> 02:55:55.466]  We've also relaunched InfoWars.net, so be sure and check that out.
[02:55:56.943 --> 02:55:59.145]  And I'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:55:59.525 --> 02:56:01.267]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:56:01.347 --> 02:56:03.789]  Thank your local affiliate that carries the broadcast.
[02:56:03.869 --> 02:56:04.870]  Thank their sponsors.
[02:56:05.370 --> 02:56:06.311]  Sponsor the show.
[02:56:06.371 --> 02:56:08.934]  Get your station to carry more of the broadcast.
[02:56:08.954 --> 02:56:10.355]  We're only carrying a few hours a day.
[02:56:11.221 --> 02:56:13.303]  Because I know, I've listened to the other shows out there.
[02:56:13.363 --> 02:56:15.365]  We're hitting it harder than anybody else.
[02:56:15.686 --> 02:56:16.607]  We've got the focus.
[02:56:16.667 --> 02:56:17.468]  We've got the guest.
[02:56:17.808 --> 02:56:19.530]  We know the New World Order's master plan.
[02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:21.412]  I study this relentlessly.
[02:56:21.532 --> 02:56:23.173]  I worked 18 hours yesterday.
[02:56:23.514 --> 02:56:25.296]  I worked 16 hours the day before that.
[02:56:25.856 --> 02:56:29.860]  I am in this fight 110% and I need your support out there.
[02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:33.204]  And I need you to spread the word and defeat the New World Order.
[02:56:33.624 --> 02:56:34.405]  God bless you all.
