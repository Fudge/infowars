[00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:06.178]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:07.899]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:09.720]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.200]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.881]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:17.262]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.703 --> 00:00:21.824]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:27.786]  Already Thursday, the 30th day of September 2004,
[00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:33.610]  Welcome, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.355]  Things did not go well for us in court yesterday, I'll be frankly honest with you.
[00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:47.925]  I mean, we call it a stalemate, but overall, the judicial misconduct, and that's clearly what it was, was unbelievable.
[00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:53.711]  That story's coming up later concerning the ACTV fight for free speech here in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:54.406 --> 00:00:57.668]  We're going to talk about the staged debate coming up tonight.
[00:00:57.768 --> 00:01:02.330]  They admit it's staged, but some people still don't know the full magnitude of this.
[00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:08.153]  Also, Putin wants to strip Russians of voting rights.
[00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:12.495]  Israel plans large-scale Gaza operation.
[00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:15.977]  Federal scientists search for a lost hydrogen bomb.
[00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:17.038]  That's ABC News.
[00:01:17.788 --> 00:01:22.411]  Truckers, toll takers, bus drivers recruited for homeland security.
[00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:25.513]  Those toll roads are going to be checkpoints, as I told you back in 98.
[00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.074]  I have the federal plan.
[00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:27.954]  Mount St.
[00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:31.756]  Helens is at the second highest level of alert it can be at.
[00:01:32.037 --> 00:01:34.638]  The next level is a full-borne eruption.
[00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:36.739]  Full-borne eruption.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.682]  And the thing is smoking and earthquakes by the minute.
[00:01:41.182 --> 00:01:42.082]  Very serious.
[00:01:42.183 --> 00:01:44.364]  We'll cover that as well.
[00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:45.945]  But, breaking news!
[00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:49.618]  Most of you know who Stanley Hilton is.
[00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:52.998]  We first interviewed him over two years ago, then interviewed him again in 2003.
[00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:59.980]  He broke revelation after revelation that later came out in the mainstream news about government complicity in 9-11.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.082]  And he's already had his office robbed once, employees threatened with arrest, himself threatened by federal judges.
[00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:09.082]  Real judicial misconduct.
[00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:12.363]  Now he has had his office ransacked!
[00:02:13.104 --> 00:02:13.944]  Ransacked!
[00:02:13.984 --> 00:02:24.009]  And I was out of touch with Stan Lee and was on a radio interview this morning in Salt Lake City on KTalk for two hours and they said, yeah, we called to get him on and he couldn't come on last week because he'd been raided.
[00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.751]  He did, but he doesn't know by who.
[00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:30.813]  They stole the files yet again on Bush complicity.
[00:02:31.373 --> 00:02:33.274]  Stanley Hilton, good to have you on with us, sir.
[00:02:34.114 --> 00:02:34.654]  Good to be here.
[00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:42.138]  We're going to break here in a moment, but just in a nutshell, for those that don't know who you are, tell them about your suit and what happened.
[00:02:43.518 --> 00:03:01.941]  Well, the class action suit in federal court against Bush, Cheney, Rice, etc., Rumsfeld and Mueller and so on, for basically authorizing and actually orchestrating the 9-11 attacks to get their political gains, and the war in Iraq and so forth.
[00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:07.782]  And it's a class action suit on behalf of victims' families as well as taxpayers.
[00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:10.843]  So anyway, last week, last Wednesday, I discovered
[00:03:11.403 --> 00:03:11.803]  We're good to go.
[00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.811]  Things are just overthrown.
[00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:30.872]  It was, the papers were everywhere.
[00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:34.774]  It was clearly made, I think, to send a message of intimidation.
[00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:43.638]  Well, Stanley, you can easily, up in a light fixture, hide a pin camera and then put the VCR up in the ceiling or in the panels.
[00:03:43.918 --> 00:03:46.020]  You need to mount hidden cameras immediately.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.981]  Right, right.
[00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:50.042]  I'm working on surveillance.
[00:03:50.122 --> 00:03:51.903]  They have them on 24-hour tapes.
[00:03:53.023 --> 00:03:53.743]  Right, yeah.
[00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:54.664]  Where can you get those, though?
[00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:57.502]  Oh, you can get them at Slave Mart.
[00:03:57.642 --> 00:04:00.265]  You can get them at Sam's, a nice unit for $400.
[00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:05.490]  But you need to unplug some of the big cameras and put in a small pin dot camera.
[00:04:05.931 --> 00:04:10.356]  And you need to have a few dummy ones that lead to another VCR that's running and then have another better hidden one.
[00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:12.799]  But it can't be wireless or they'll pick it up.
[00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.020]  You need to have wires to it.
[00:04:17.308 --> 00:04:30.879]  Files pertaining to the 9-11 suit as well as other files were stolen, and a police report was made, fingerprints were taken, and so I don't know who did it, I really can't say, but, you know, I feel it's probably someone associated with the Bush campaign.
[00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:31.920]  Dirty tricksters.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.261]  But I can't prove that at this point.
[00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:36.143]  But you can prove the judge told you to stop doing interviews.
[00:04:36.624 --> 00:04:40.287]  You can prove that your staff's been threatened, that you've had a mole inside.
[00:04:40.787 --> 00:04:45.451]  Stay there, we'll come back, go over that, talk about this latest revelation with Stanley Hilton.
[00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:52.124]  Chief of Staff for Bob Dole for many years, just a great American, an expert on the New World Order.
[00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:53.266]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:55.411]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:04:55.731 --> 00:04:56.312]  Stay with us!
[00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.952]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.372 --> 00:05:13.613]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.853 --> 00:05:20.875]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:27.357]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.377 --> 00:05:28.717]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:32.021]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:33.082]  Eliminate the cost.
[00:05:33.142 --> 00:05:34.183]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.504 --> 00:05:41.752]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.053 --> 00:05:45.437]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:02.426]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.787 --> 00:06:08.531]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:13.936]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:14.276 --> 00:06:16.398]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements
[00:06:16.618 --> 00:06:17.158]  We're good to go!
[00:06:38.513 --> 00:06:44.498]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:06:52.023 --> 00:06:52.984]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.425 --> 00:07:08.812]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:07:09.093 --> 00:07:13.817]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:07:14.057 --> 00:07:19.703]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:07:19.923 --> 00:07:20.663]  We're good to go.
[00:07:44.957 --> 00:07:45.477]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:07.856]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.616 --> 00:08:09.717]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.377 --> 00:08:11.218]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:12.859]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:17.261]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:21.784]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.513 --> 00:08:32.855]  That's right, it's Alex Jones, crashing the lies and disinformation, waging war on corruption, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central.
[00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:45.338]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial, telecasting on global shortwave during the day at 94.75, at night at 32.10, and the internet at Infowars.com, as well as TCNlive.com.
[00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:49.975]  Okay, it is the 30th day of September 2004 on this Thursday.
[00:08:50.035 --> 00:08:52.557]  Stanley Hilton is just joining us for the next two segments.
[00:08:52.817 --> 00:08:57.540]  He's in the car, about to go into court, so if his cell phone cuts out, we'll call him right back.
[00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:08.949]  Stanley Hilton already had somebody break in his office once, steal files concerning his eyewitnesses in the government and out of government about the government funding hijackers, paying for their houses, having
[00:09:09.469 --> 00:09:16.734]  Agents in their homes, informants in their homes, NORAD standing down on 9-11 because of drills that were being run.
[00:09:16.994 --> 00:09:21.157]  He first broke that here back in 2002, then we had him back on in 2003.
[00:09:21.457 --> 00:09:22.918]  Later it came out in the mainstream news.
[00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:26.841]  This time his office got ransacked last Wednesday.
[00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:28.882]  Files stolen, things overturned.
[00:09:29.243 --> 00:09:30.544]  He's had employees threatened.
[00:09:30.924 --> 00:09:34.846]  He's had a judge, federal judge, tell him to stop doing interviews.
[00:09:34.926 --> 00:09:38.329]  Just amazing, but not even an order, just a verbal thing.
[00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:40.850]  This is amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.371]  Stanley Hilton, describe coming into work and what you saw.
[00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:46.091]  What happened?
[00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:54.054]  Well, I went to one of my offices last Wednesday, and first of all, I noticed that the handle to the door was totally loose.
[00:09:54.134 --> 00:09:55.995]  It had been, obviously, jarred loose.
[00:09:56.515 --> 00:09:58.475]  And then the door was unlocked.
[00:09:58.656 --> 00:10:02.217]  So I walked in, and inside it looked like a whirlwind had gone through.
[00:10:03.017 --> 00:10:05.078]  Everything on the desk was just overturned.
[00:10:06.664 --> 00:10:07.705]  We're good to go.
[00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:34.519]  Uh, every drawer in the desk, things have been overturned, put upside down, books that have been, you know, face up or face down.
[00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:37.421]  Whoever did it wanted to make it obvious that someone had been in there.
[00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:38.741]  They made no effort to conceal it.
[00:10:39.142 --> 00:10:40.442]  Anyway, I filed a police report.
[00:10:40.462 --> 00:10:47.986]  I don't know who did it, but I suspect it's someone associated with the opposition, with the gangsters that call themselves the president of this country.
[00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:51.916]  Now, again, let's go over the history of this.
[00:10:51.956 --> 00:10:55.637]  You filed this suit saying the government's behind 9-11, criminal elements.
[00:10:55.657 --> 00:10:56.717]  You have the evidence.
[00:10:57.077 --> 00:10:59.798]  Again, you've broken stuff here months before it's in the mainstream news.
[00:11:00.198 --> 00:11:01.518]  You've done an incredible job.
[00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:06.499]  And then you had a federal judge tell you to shut up and stop doing interviews.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.620]  But you haven't done that.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.401]  You have been now on this show and many other broadcasts.
[00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:12.521]  It's been
[00:11:13.241 --> 00:11:15.122]  It's been a sensation on the internet.
[00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:20.403]  People are really checking out what you had to say in your case, and it seems like they're panicking, Stanley.
[00:11:21.283 --> 00:11:30.845]  Well, the judge actually dispatched two emissaries, two goon squads, to threaten to kick me off the court if I didn't drop the lawsuit against Bush.
[00:11:30.945 --> 00:11:31.786]  Drop the lawsuit.
[00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:42.386]  The uh... it was clearly an interference with the First Amendment right in an attempt to interfere with a lawful lawsuit, intimidate an attorney, intimidate witnesses.
[00:11:42.706 --> 00:11:51.834]  This is what's called obstruction of justice, but when you have the lawless people running the government and manipulating judges and so forth, there is no justice, there is no law.
[00:11:51.954 --> 00:11:52.555]  That's what we have.
[00:11:52.575 --> 00:11:53.275]  We have a system of
[00:11:54.236 --> 00:12:01.498]  Injustice, the Department of Injustice, headed by Ashcroft and Company, and we have the lawless people masquerading as law enforcement.
[00:12:01.598 --> 00:12:03.019]  So, that's the real problem.
[00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:05.959]  Basically, you have gangsters heading the government of this country.
[00:12:05.979 --> 00:12:14.982]  It's like dealing with the Mafia, and basically, we are suing them under the RICO statute, which was originally designed to sue corrupt organizations such as the Mafia.
[00:12:15.042 --> 00:12:18.043]  Basically, it's the same mentality of these Bush people, in my opinion.
[00:12:18.837 --> 00:12:20.499]  Well, and the same with the Clinton people.
[00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:28.786]  Remember the whole blood case, where eight years after there was a federal law against taking blood out of prisons and selling it, Bill Clinton had it statewide.
[00:12:28.826 --> 00:12:33.910]  We interviewed the doctors who were there inside the prisons, who also had their own successful practices.
[00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.994]  One of them wrote a book about it, was into prosthetics.
[00:12:38.694 --> 00:12:49.262]  And when the Hemophiliac Society of Canada started suing Bill Clinton and others, they got raided in the middle of the night and had all their files stolen concerning the blood case.
[00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:54.405]  And the same night, the doctor's office in Little Rock was firebombed.
[00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:56.267]  So we've seen this before.
[00:12:56.983 --> 00:12:57.223]  Hmm.
[00:12:57.824 --> 00:13:02.129]  Uh, yeah, the MO, the pattern of intimidation and theft of files, is interesting.
[00:13:02.169 --> 00:13:10.438]  Although, I must say that under the Patriot Act, or rather, the Anti- or, Unpatriot Act, as I call it, uh, it seems to me the government could have come in under that.
[00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:11.219]  Apparently, they've got...
[00:13:12.963 --> 00:13:13.884]  Section 213.
[00:13:14.365 --> 00:13:16.628]  Yeah, there is no Fourth Amendment.
[00:13:16.648 --> 00:13:18.510]  They've destroyed the Bill of Rights of this country.
[00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:23.557]  They've destroyed everything the country stood for and committed treason against the country.
[00:13:23.657 --> 00:13:26.821]  And, you know, it's quite possible we can get away with this.
[00:13:27.862 --> 00:13:36.391]  Patriot Act, it's legal, but we're going to raise it in the suit and test the constitutionality of it, because I think it's completely unconstitutional.
[00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:42.637]  Unless you amend the Constitution and repeal the Fourth Amendment and First Amendment and Fifth Amendment, which Bush would certainly like to do.
[00:13:42.657 --> 00:13:43.878]  There's no question about it.
[00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:46.340]  Unless you do that, it's unconstitutional.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:54.586]  The problem is you've got bush puppets like Scalia and Rehnquist, and I'll call them themselves judges in the Supreme Court, and so that's the ultimate slayer.
[00:13:54.606 --> 00:13:55.907]  They're the ones that installed them.
[00:13:55.967 --> 00:13:58.529]  I mean, what are the chances of getting a fair shake from people like that?
[00:14:00.545 --> 00:14:01.246]  Exactly.
[00:14:01.706 --> 00:14:06.330]  Let's spend a little bit of time on how this has affected your employees.
[00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.712]  You're a prominent lawyer for several decades.
[00:14:08.752 --> 00:14:10.854]  You practice law in this court.
[00:14:11.234 --> 00:14:13.236]  They've been threatened with arrest.
[00:14:14.137 --> 00:14:15.418]  It's all color of law.
[00:14:15.518 --> 00:14:16.759]  Total intimidation.
[00:14:17.239 --> 00:14:21.723]  Judicial misconduct clearly fits the textbook example of it.
[00:14:21.963 --> 00:14:24.846]  How are your employees handling this Gestapo intimidation?
[00:14:26.287 --> 00:14:28.189]  Well, it's very disconcerting.
[00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:30.490]  People are not handling it well at all.
[00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:34.013]  I don't feel safe traveling at this point because of the threats I've gotten.
[00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:38.577]  I've gotten phone calls from people, from phone numbers that appear on call waiting, for example.
[00:14:38.717 --> 00:14:44.261]  I mean, from caller ID, like one yesterday that came out of Erie Coach 412, which is supposed to be near Pittsburgh.
[00:14:44.521 --> 00:14:47.223]  Now, when you call that number back, they say the number has been disconnected.
[00:14:47.243 --> 00:14:48.184]  There is no such number.
[00:14:48.544 --> 00:14:50.265]  Now, that's the kind of thing I'm dealing with.
[00:14:50.345 --> 00:14:56.089]  I'm getting calls like this constantly from people that represent that they're this or that, representing their media.
[00:14:56.429 --> 00:15:03.914]  And then it turns out, apparently, the phone number has been encrypted by whoever sent it out, giving you a bogus phone number that appears on call waiting.
[00:15:04.235 --> 00:15:06.276]  And then meanwhile, so-called researchers
[00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:19.103]  When our evidence is clear and documented and totally factual, have been covertly launching smear campaigns against yourself and myself.
[00:15:19.564 --> 00:15:22.785]  I mean, it clearly shows us what and who we're dealing with.
[00:15:22.825 --> 00:15:25.887]  Let's not say any names, though, Stanley, and give them what they want.
[00:15:26.827 --> 00:15:31.370]  But clearly, you are right in there, you know, on target.
[00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.252]  Where is your suit going from here, facing all of this obstruction?
[00:15:36.743 --> 00:15:46.094]  Well, the government made a motion to dismiss the case claiming that Bush and company are absolutely immune from suit or above the law and it was originally scheduled for October 15th.
[00:15:46.134 --> 00:15:52.321]  The judge quietly cancelled the hearing without any explanation, cancelled the hearing even before our opposition was due.
[00:15:52.762 --> 00:15:54.524]  Our opposition was filed last week.
[00:15:54.824 --> 00:15:55.284]  We're waiting.
[00:15:56.145 --> 00:16:01.469]  The government will file a reply brief today, supposedly, and then I guess we'll get a decision by mail.
[00:16:01.489 --> 00:16:09.295]  What you're seeing in the federal courts more and more is they're canceling these court hearings and they're doing decisions on paper and they're mailing you decisions.
[00:16:09.355 --> 00:16:13.298]  I mean, it just makes you further removed from the actual court system.
[00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:15.520]  It's just another step of stripping people of their rights.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.402]  You know, if you can't even go into court, you have to rely on the mails.
[00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:19.683]  You can't even talk to a judge.
[00:16:20.316 --> 00:16:23.638]  I mean, what kind of system is that?
[00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:43.446]  Bill Clinton, for lying about not having a relationship with a woman, and other women, Paula Jones, was pulled in by a grand jury to the state court there in Arkansas.
[00:16:43.866 --> 00:16:49.529]  But now, I've seen the news articles where the Defense Department and the Justice Department have openly said,
[00:16:50.666 --> 00:16:54.290]  My information, again I can't prove it, but some of my sources say that Bush has issued
[00:17:08.135 --> 00:17:29.384]  uh... classified national so-called national security executive order or national insecurity i would call executive order since his goal is to make the country insecure not secure uh... in this order he's declared a state of national emergency permanent national emergency quote war end quote in which he's imposed a form of press censorship and I've been told this by several people of the
[00:17:29.944 --> 00:17:43.649]  Some mainstream networks, television networks, that they cannot print, they're under orders from the Bush administration not to broadcast any news story whatsoever that challenges the official government party line on what happened on 9-11.
[00:17:43.989 --> 00:17:52.373]  That means even things like the inconsistency between the physical evidence of the Pentagon, you know, it is a 16-foot hole and it's supposed to have been made by a 125-foot wide 757 aircraft.
[00:17:56.174 --> 00:18:01.876]  And they can't publish anything like this, so I think there is a form of censorship going on.
[00:18:02.476 --> 00:18:08.478]  It's similar to what happened during World War II and World War I, and during the Civil War.
[00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:12.560]  The Sedition Acts, which a lot of national talk show hosts and others have called for.
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:20.203]  Well, Stanley, the Washington Times reported in 2001, after 9-11, that 500 dormant martial law provisions had been activated.
[00:18:20.543 --> 00:18:23.984]  That's admitted of the specifics of telling the media not to talk.
[00:18:24.304 --> 00:18:32.810]  We've only gotten rumblings of this, but it's clear the Zogby Poll says half the New Yorkers believe the government was involved in 9-11, but it's not been in one single newspaper.
[00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.231]  Right, right.
[00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:36.392]  There is a form of censorship going on.
[00:18:36.432 --> 00:18:43.357]  That's a real scandal, and we're trying to find that out in the discovery process of the court, but I mean, if you can't get a court hearing if you're getting
[00:18:43.985 --> 00:18:45.545]  Well, I'll tell you this, Stanley.
[00:19:09.632 --> 00:19:12.073]  They're going to this thing where you don't even get to go on the court.
[00:19:12.113 --> 00:19:13.433]  It's a video deposition.
[00:19:13.693 --> 00:19:16.593]  They are shifting the whole system to where they can just do this.
[00:19:17.473 --> 00:19:23.255]  Yeah, the electronic so-called revolution and the electronic filing system, in my opinion, is a real abuse.
[00:19:23.415 --> 00:19:25.895]  And not only that, but there are many glitches in the system.
[00:19:26.275 --> 00:19:28.535]  So, many times you can't even retrieve documents.
[00:19:28.635 --> 00:19:30.756]  In this case, the government has filed some documents.
[00:19:30.776 --> 00:19:34.517]  For example, their motion to dismiss, they could not retrieve it through email.
[00:19:34.617 --> 00:19:35.557]  And it was impossible.
[00:19:35.577 --> 00:19:36.757]  No explanation was given.
[00:19:37.137 --> 00:19:38.619]  I don't think that's a failure.
[00:19:38.639 --> 00:19:39.319]  Stay there, Stanley.
[00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:41.642]  We'll do a few more minutes with you on the other side of this break.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:01.425]  Thank you.
[00:20:15.984 --> 00:20:21.248]  And they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:21.468 --> 00:20:24.130]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:30.915]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:31.075 --> 00:20:32.956]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:33.156 --> 00:20:39.161]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:39.421 --> 00:20:45.085]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:20:45.405 --> 00:20:49.327]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:49.347 --> 00:20:50.068]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:50.088 --> 00:20:50.788]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.405 --> 00:21:03.767]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:21:04.008 --> 00:21:07.852]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:21:08.172 --> 00:21:08.993]  Read the labels.
[00:21:09.413 --> 00:21:13.537]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:13.777 --> 00:21:17.962]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:21:18.342 --> 00:21:23.207]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:21:23.587 --> 00:21:27.170]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:32.694]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:21:32.974 --> 00:21:35.716]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:21:35.997 --> 00:21:36.897]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:21:37.198 --> 00:21:47.946]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:22:01.234 --> 00:22:04.917]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:05.317 --> 00:22:10.740]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:11.201 --> 00:22:12.301]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:22:12.321 --> 00:22:16.364]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:17.004 --> 00:22:30.292]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:30.813 --> 00:22:36.116]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:36.436 --> 00:22:42.320]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:22:43.064 --> 00:22:44.305]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:44.325 --> 00:22:46.026]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:22:46.046 --> 00:22:46.466]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:46.486 --> 00:22:48.508]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:22:48.528 --> 00:22:48.588]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:03.375]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[00:23:03.756 --> 00:23:06.258]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[00:23:06.498 --> 00:23:13.563]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:23:13.763 --> 00:23:17.046]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[00:23:17.286 --> 00:23:19.328]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:23:19.668 --> 00:23:27.494]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:23:27.754 --> 00:23:29.035]  Either way, why chance it?
[00:23:29.135 --> 00:23:39.082]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[00:23:50.509 --> 00:23:50.709]  That's 877-835-5555.
[00:24:04.875 --> 00:24:10.176]  On the front lines of the Info War and the battle for the Republic, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:11.676]  Stanley Hilton's parked his car.
[00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:14.037]  He's walking up to the courthouse right now.
[00:24:14.377 --> 00:24:23.938]  I would point out he's in San Francisco with all these supposed liberal judges protecting George W. Then they have these little staged fights over these diversionary issues.
[00:24:24.478 --> 00:24:26.379]  Stanley, during the break we were talking about
[00:24:28.159 --> 00:24:34.981]  The whole court system now and how they just cancel hearings and say go to the internet for your filings and then the information is not even there.
[00:24:35.001 --> 00:24:45.525]  Yeah, they have you, the federal court, a mandatory e-filing, you just file things electronically and you're supposed to retrieve documents when they notify you by email.
[00:24:45.825 --> 00:24:49.648]  The problem is, when you click on the number to get the documents, sometimes nothing comes up.
[00:24:50.028 --> 00:24:52.751]  Then you try to complain about it, and they say, well, it must be your fault.
[00:24:52.771 --> 00:24:53.631]  We're not going to do anything.
[00:24:53.971 --> 00:24:55.453]  And that's what they call justice here.
[00:24:55.533 --> 00:24:57.674]  It's trial by internet.
[00:24:58.935 --> 00:25:00.517]  Well, that's what it's all going to.
[00:25:00.697 --> 00:25:05.420]  And so, what is the process like in the federal courts with your lawsuits?
[00:25:06.221 --> 00:25:07.962]  Pardon?
[00:25:08.043 --> 00:25:12.246]  In a nutshell, describe the process for listeners about what's happening with your lawsuits.
[00:25:13.089 --> 00:25:19.492]  Well, the government filed a motion to dismiss the suit three or four weeks ago, and then I got notified by email.
[00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:22.974]  I tried to click on the document to bring it up.
[00:25:23.034 --> 00:25:24.235]  I think it was document number 35.
[00:25:24.455 --> 00:25:25.675]  You get it by email.
[00:25:25.695 --> 00:25:26.456]  You're supposed to click.
[00:25:26.756 --> 00:25:27.476]  That thing came up.
[00:25:27.756 --> 00:25:29.237]  I must have spent three hours trying.
[00:25:29.557 --> 00:25:30.258]  I called the U.S.
[00:25:30.278 --> 00:25:32.639]  Superior's Office and asked for a hard copy.
[00:25:32.659 --> 00:25:36.661]  They said, you don't have to give me a hard copy because the rules are you have to get it from e-filing.
[00:25:37.061 --> 00:25:39.922]  And I called the e-filing helpline, and they're useless.
[00:25:41.363 --> 00:25:45.024]  Eventually I went to a magistrate judge to force him to give me the thing.
[00:25:45.064 --> 00:25:49.446]  He personally brought it in to me while I was sitting in his chambers on another case two weeks ago.
[00:25:49.486 --> 00:25:50.766]  He brought me in the hard copy.
[00:25:50.786 --> 00:25:51.907]  It was like 50 pages.
[00:25:52.267 --> 00:25:54.487]  So that's what you're getting now.
[00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:56.008]  It's called due process, I guess.
[00:25:56.868 --> 00:26:07.053]  I think Bush and his company should admit they want to repeal the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and just repeal the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and come open to Biden, instead of pretending that they're Democrats.
[00:26:07.133 --> 00:26:10.335]  I mean, they're really mounting a war on freedom and on the justice system.
[00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:13.537]  Why don't they just admit it and repeal the Constitution?
[00:26:13.557 --> 00:26:14.497]  That's what they should do.
[00:26:15.077 --> 00:26:15.758]  Anyway, I have to go.
[00:26:15.818 --> 00:26:17.939]  I'm at the courthouse, so I have to go now, Alex.
[00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:20.560]  Alright, Stanley, one last comment from you.
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.682]  They've introduced the national ID card now and two separate bills.
[00:26:23.722 --> 00:26:24.382]  What do you say to that?
[00:26:25.925 --> 00:26:32.510]  It's part of this attempt to exert more control through this electronic menace that they call computers.
[00:26:32.951 --> 00:26:34.212]  Everything is computerized.
[00:26:34.252 --> 00:26:36.914]  Well, computers are subject to great manipulation and fraud.
[00:26:37.214 --> 00:26:42.678]  In fact, voting by electronic voting is a perfect example where there's no way to verify who voted for what.
[00:26:43.078 --> 00:26:45.200]  It's just another way to manipulate and control.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:52.105]  I think this electronic, uh, you know, internet and e-filing things and national ID cards are incredibly dangerous.
[00:26:52.145 --> 00:27:01.393]  They could put anything down on a computer through your national ID card and accuse you of any crime or any act and then they'll say it's gospel truth because it happens to be on the computer.
[00:27:01.773 --> 00:27:06.657]  It's ultimate, ultimate machine for control, uh, mind control and, and dictatorship.
[00:27:06.997 --> 00:27:08.258]  Last comment for you.
[00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:10.300]  I want to thank you for your incredible courage.
[00:27:10.781 --> 00:27:12.342]  Office ransacked threats.
[00:27:12.922 --> 00:27:18.485]  You name it, and one internet writer described you as jumping on a hand grenade for the American people.
[00:27:19.526 --> 00:27:21.807]  Just God bless you, Stanley Hilton, we'll have you back on.
[00:27:21.827 --> 00:27:23.108]  Okay, thanks, bye.
[00:27:23.128 --> 00:27:23.968]  Thank you, take care.
[00:27:24.829 --> 00:27:31.132]  Alright, walking into the federal courthouse, my friends, and I guess now I should spend a few minutes on this and we'll get into Mount St.
[00:27:31.173 --> 00:27:35.415]  Helens and Vladimir Putin and the fake debates and all the rest of it.
[00:27:36.523 --> 00:27:45.010]  We're going to have Stephan Ray, who's really our clerk on all this, who keeps all the documents in order, joining us for a little while in the third hour on this, but it's a First Amendment case.
[00:27:46.311 --> 00:27:53.497]  We have partially blocked the AXS TV board, most of them have resigned, over their public attempt to get rid of free speech on AXS television.
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:17.613]  But now, these guys, we went into court yesterday and my lawyer, who's won huge cases, represented just massive people in the media, one of the best lawyers in Texas, I mean he's even been involved in cases with Arnold Schwarzenegger, just to give you an idea, he said in his decades at the courts, he's never seen a judge act like what we saw yesterday.
[00:28:18.073 --> 00:28:20.834]  By the way, each TV channel is worth $5 million a year.
[00:28:22.235 --> 00:28:23.796]  These are public channels, they want them.
[00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:34.037]  And, uh, she walked right in before we even could have a motion or even talk and she said, I am dismissing, uh, your petition to depose, uh, which is a tort reform.
[00:28:34.057 --> 00:28:35.779]  We get to depose them before suing them.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.183]  And, uh, my lawyer stood up and said, no judge, I'm, I'm going to go through the evidence.
[00:28:40.223 --> 00:28:43.726]  They've given you an affidavit saying that they never passed board minutes.
[00:28:43.766 --> 00:28:44.907]  They would restrict free speech.
[00:28:45.287 --> 00:28:49.230]  Here are the blown up board minutes on big, huge, giant poster phone boards we had.
[00:28:49.571 --> 00:28:52.033]  And she started screaming at him and saying she didn't want to see him.
[00:28:52.493 --> 00:28:54.534]  And he said, but Judge, they perjured themselves.
[00:28:54.574 --> 00:28:57.275]  And she began screaming at him, saying, I don't want to see it.
[00:28:57.295 --> 00:28:59.615]  And he said, I want you on the record, Judge.
[00:28:59.655 --> 00:29:00.776]  He was very dynamic.
[00:29:01.076 --> 00:29:02.836]  And she kept telling him to shut up, and he wouldn't.
[00:29:02.856 --> 00:29:11.899]  And he went on for about five minutes, saying he'd never seen anything like this in his life, and this was unbelievable, and this was, I mean, it was dynamic.
[00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:13.440]  By the way, we had a motion in there.
[00:29:14.358 --> 00:29:16.120]  To let the media videotape.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.140]  There were news cameras there.
[00:29:17.401 --> 00:29:22.185]  First thing she did was grab that, slam it down and go, I AM DENYING YOUR REQUEST!
[00:29:24.206 --> 00:29:26.348]  Just slammed it down on the dais.
[00:29:26.729 --> 00:29:29.231]  I AM DENYING YOUR REQUEST FOR MEDIA COVERAGE!
[00:29:29.791 --> 00:29:32.133]  AND NOW, I AM DENYING THIS MOTION!
[00:29:34.015 --> 00:29:36.137]  Just without even hearing any arguments, nothing.
[00:29:36.157 --> 00:29:37.538]  We had this huge case prepared.
[00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:38.659]  So that's fine.
[00:29:40.234 --> 00:29:40.775]  It's fine.
[00:29:41.395 --> 00:29:47.020]  They don't control all the judges, and we're gonna launch multiple, I mean, multiple legal actions.
[00:29:47.121 --> 00:29:47.761]  Full bore.
[00:29:47.841 --> 00:29:48.842]  You want it, you got it.
[00:29:51.365 --> 00:29:52.305]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.746 --> 00:29:54.367]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.288 --> 00:29:57.951]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:02.893 --> 00:31:06.976]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.136 --> 00:31:09.998]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.098 --> 00:31:16.823]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:16.983 --> 00:31:20.005]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.205 --> 00:31:22.606]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:22.706 --> 00:31:30.612]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:31:31.032 --> 00:31:32.893]  Benzene, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform.
[00:31:33.053 --> 00:31:33.853]  MTBE.

[00:32:03.175 --> 00:32:10.520]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.243]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.

[00:33:13.214 --> 00:33:18.215]  For those that missed it, we had Stanley Hilton on for the first 28 minutes of the broadcast.
[00:33:18.555 --> 00:33:24.517]  Bob Dole's former Chief of Staff suing the government for involvement in 9-11, deposed members of the U.S.

[00:33:29.939 --> 00:33:31.839]  He's been robbed once, had files taken.
[00:33:31.879 --> 00:33:34.600]  This time they ransacked his office like you see in the movies.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.961]  Things overturned and in some filing cabinets, half the files missing.
[00:33:41.545 --> 00:33:45.607]  We need to get that posted on the internet, just that interview, as soon as possible.
[00:33:45.627 --> 00:33:48.949]  One of our wonderful listeners needs to put a transcript of that up.
[00:33:49.409 --> 00:33:54.732]  So tens of millions of people, literally, these Shulton stories get posted everywhere.

[00:34:25.394 --> 00:34:26.495]  That's the headline here.
[00:34:27.716 --> 00:34:30.919]  Also, terror videos edited to make bigger impact.
[00:34:30.999 --> 00:34:33.341]  These head chopping videos.
[00:34:34.597 --> 00:34:36.838]  Car bomb kills 34 children in Baghdad.
[00:34:37.439 --> 00:34:40.821]  Ashcroft likely to appeal Patriot Act ruling.

[00:34:42.782 --> 00:34:45.824]  Scientist predicts small or moderate volcanic eruption.
[00:34:46.384 --> 00:34:47.245]  That was yesterday.
[00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:48.986]  Now they've even upped it and said it.
[00:34:49.366 --> 00:34:50.466]  Who knows what's going to happen?
[00:34:50.787 --> 00:34:51.207]  Mount St.
[00:34:51.247 --> 00:34:53.588]  Helens has not acted like this since 1980.
[00:34:54.029 --> 00:34:58.031]  Now it's worse than what happened in 1986 when it had a medium-sized eruption.
[00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:02.866]  Also, leaked document, Israel almost nuked Syria.
[00:35:03.326 --> 00:35:07.773]  House votes to end handgun ban in DC, but it was totally staged, folks.
[00:35:08.494 --> 00:35:09.235]  We'll get to that.

[00:35:19.071 --> 00:35:20.572]  They said they were going to put it in DC.
[00:35:20.612 --> 00:35:22.532]  Now it's there, flying around watching people.
[00:35:23.053 --> 00:35:25.514]  Senators urge to stop Patriot Act expansion.

[00:35:51.873 --> 00:35:55.776]  Before I do that, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:35:56.336 --> 00:35:57.337]  If you're on the internet,
[00:35:58.081 --> 00:36:15.198]  If you want to hear the best radio interviews I do, the most important, original text reports, all 11 of my videos, a bunch of other videos that we post that folks have authorized us to post, Eric Hubschmidt's video, 9-11 Painful Deceptions, George Humphrey's video, 9-11 The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati,
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:27.487]  Anthony J. Hilder's new 9-11 film, 9-11, The Greatest Lie Ever Sold, a new JFK video we posted that is amazing, a great documentary by a wonderful researcher.
[00:36:27.907 --> 00:36:30.228]  That's just the stuff that's gone up in the last few weeks.
[00:36:30.949 --> 00:36:35.011]  My weekly TV reports, some weeks two reports, every week one report.
[00:36:35.652 --> 00:36:37.333]  I do two TV shows every week.
[00:36:37.353 --> 00:36:38.574]  We usually just post one of them.
[00:36:38.614 --> 00:36:39.875]  A lot of times we post two of them.
[00:36:40.335 --> 00:36:42.036]  More often than not, there's two reports a week.
[00:36:43.337 --> 00:36:48.807]  So much media and high quality, high bandwidth streams, low bandwidth streams.
[00:36:48.827 --> 00:36:51.752]  We've got it for Mac, we've got it for PC, we've got it for Linux.
[00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:56.672]  My friends, PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:37:04.535 --> 00:37:05.456]  Come on.
[00:37:05.476 --> 00:37:06.056]  15 cents a day.
[00:37:06.496 --> 00:37:14.040]  And this is how we're able to expand the other websites and have more free video just for the general public that's visiting our website for the first time.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.381]  We had to do PrisonPlanet.tv and it's been a great success.
[00:37:17.621 --> 00:37:18.202]  People love it.
[00:37:18.422 --> 00:37:21.043]  We had to do it or stop having video and audio.
[00:37:22.415 --> 00:37:27.579]  So this just pays the bills to run the websites and to have more webmasters.
[00:37:27.799 --> 00:37:31.782]  We added a new webmaster for Infowars.net just for that site.
[00:37:31.842 --> 00:37:37.226]  Now look at it grow and have new original material and have its own webmaster.
[00:37:37.506 --> 00:37:38.486]  See, we're going to do that.
[00:37:38.566 --> 00:37:42.987]  More and more websites, more and more webmasters, more and more information.
[00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:46.628]  We take every dime and put it back into the fight against the New World Order.

[00:38:26.857 --> 00:38:27.617]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:38:27.657 --> 00:38:27.877]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:38:38.522 --> 00:38:41.064]  My first 10 videos are $25.95 apiece.
[00:38:41.724 --> 00:38:43.185]  $20 if you order 3 or more of any of them.
[00:38:43.385 --> 00:38:44.386]  They're all over 2 hours.
[00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:50.931]  My new video, American Dictators, is only $19.95 because it's only 90 minutes long.
[00:38:50.971 --> 00:38:51.591]  It's excellent.
[00:38:51.891 --> 00:38:53.252]  Documenting the staged election of 04.
[00:38:54.634 --> 00:38:58.177]  So please take action now.
[00:38:58.197 --> 00:39:07.703]  1-888-253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:39:07.943 --> 00:39:11.566]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to Ron in New York.
[00:39:11.966 --> 00:39:13.047]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:39:13.127 --> 00:39:13.547]  Welcome.
[00:39:13.567 --> 00:39:14.408]  Hi Alex.
[00:39:14.708 --> 00:39:15.008]  Hello.
[00:39:15.068 --> 00:39:18.371]  Sounds to me like Mr. Hilton was the victim of a sneak and peek search.
[00:39:18.931 --> 00:39:20.492]  Which by the way, the U.S.
[00:39:20.572 --> 00:39:22.994]  Southern District Court, Federal Court for New York
[00:39:23.641 --> 00:39:28.584]  Struck down provisions of the sneak and peek aspect of the Patriot Act yesterday.
[00:39:28.844 --> 00:39:29.985]  But, but, but, but!
[00:39:30.065 --> 00:39:33.847]  It will be appealed and I do not expect it to hold up on appeal, in my opinion.
[00:39:34.088 --> 00:39:37.870]  Let me just add to what you just said, Ron, and I'm sorry for interrupting, but you're absolutely right.
[00:39:39.171 --> 00:39:45.355]  Federal courts said that they couldn't be doing the enemy combatant grabbing citizens, but they keep doing it.
[00:39:45.895 --> 00:39:50.878]  They say they're not allowed to torture people, but they keep doing it while conditioning the public that torture is good.
[00:39:50.938 --> 00:39:52.039]  Go ahead and talk, I'm sorry.
[00:39:52.998 --> 00:39:57.960]  I don't expect that it would be held up on appeal if it does get to the Supreme Court.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.500]  Mr. Hilton was right.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:10.864]  In addition to the fact that he felt that there were other partisans on the court in favor of what's been going on in the administration, I don't know if you're aware of this, but Clarence Thomas is a married relative of the Bush family.
[00:40:11.324 --> 00:40:12.065]  Yes, I know.
[00:40:12.365 --> 00:40:13.405]  They're all married together.
[00:40:13.425 --> 00:40:14.125]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:14.285 --> 00:40:16.446]  He's married to Barbara Bush's niece.
[00:40:17.146 --> 00:40:19.007]  And I don't think most people are aware of that.
[00:40:19.847 --> 00:40:21.848]  Well, I mean, listen, this is a mafia!
[00:40:22.634 --> 00:40:25.156]  Pals related to Bush, very closely.
[00:40:25.816 --> 00:40:27.378]  They're all related, folks.
[00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:28.759]  It is a giant joke.
[00:40:29.159 --> 00:40:31.320]  It is a hereditary mafia bloodline.
[00:40:31.521 --> 00:40:39.186]  This is how mafias, whether they're German or Jewish or Chinese, it's how the triads operate, it's how mafia works.
[00:40:39.526 --> 00:40:42.369]  And you criticize a Chinese triad, you're anti-Chinese.
[00:40:42.569 --> 00:40:44.770]  You criticize a Jewish mob, you're anti-Jew.
[00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:48.653]  You criticize a German mob or an Irish mob, you're anti-Irish.
[00:40:48.953 --> 00:40:50.775]  No, we're anti-crime!
[00:40:51.355 --> 00:40:52.896]  It's done on a super scale.
[00:40:53.357 --> 00:40:54.097]  That's what it is.
[00:40:54.217 --> 00:40:58.440]  It's an oligarchy, I guess is the best way to describe it, or an autocracy.
[00:40:59.521 --> 00:41:04.745]  But another strange thing, too, that's dawned upon me, and I wonder if this has dawned upon any of you listeners.
[00:41:05.685 --> 00:41:17.494]  It haven't strike anyone as unusual that, somewhere within 30 or 45 minutes after the World Trade Center was hit, okay, the worst, probably the worst act of terrorism in human history,
[00:41:18.263 --> 00:41:23.024]  That they all had it nailed down as to specifically who did it, how, what, where, and when.
[00:41:23.044 --> 00:41:33.307]  They had pictures of Bin Laden on the screen, and the month before the attack, that's why I got on air and said they're about to attack a woman on Bin Laden, they were showing Bin Laden on TV going, he's bad, he's about to get you.
[00:41:33.327 --> 00:41:34.787]  They introduced him to us.
[00:41:35.167 --> 00:41:41.589]  Within 30 minutes, the worst crime in human history, they knew everything about what had happened.
[00:41:41.629 --> 00:41:43.410]  What do you mean the worst crime in human history?
[00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.050]  Well, put it this way, the worst
[00:41:45.817 --> 00:41:48.138]  Individual or instantaneous event.
[00:41:48.398 --> 00:41:49.579]  Single action, ma'am.
[00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:50.939]  Single action crime, right.
[00:41:51.679 --> 00:41:54.801]  And yet they claim they knew nothing about it, you know, leading up to it.
[00:41:55.101 --> 00:42:02.464]  Yet within 30 minutes, they had the suspect all, you know, I mean, proverbially speaking, hung, convicted and everything else.
[00:42:03.024 --> 00:42:05.545]  And nothing about that struck anyone as unusual.
[00:42:06.488 --> 00:42:13.394]  Well, just to go back to, that's a great point you made, but to go back, some of the first blitzes on London killed 5,000 people a pop.
[00:42:13.934 --> 00:42:18.718]  Bombings of Dresden with firebombs would kill 80,000 people in a single night, so.
[00:42:19.319 --> 00:42:21.201]  But, and I see all of those as crimes.
[00:42:22.081 --> 00:42:26.825]  Well, they were crimes, at least there was some, I mean, as legitimate as this can be, a state of war.
[00:42:26.845 --> 00:42:30.949]  I mean, this was, you know, an unannounced act of terrorism by a stateless
[00:42:31.898 --> 00:42:57.735]  uh... criminal and uh... it was in a little different category those were horrible event don't get me wrong but this was this is categorized or at least as a a pure terroristic act all those other things there was a lot of war crimes but understand you know when somebody's going to frame somebody they like to first introduce them as the bad guy uh... and of course bin laden played that part as a good british intel officer his family goes back to nineteen eighteen that's admitted uh... always serving the brits
[00:42:58.374 --> 00:43:04.318]  But there he is, you know, right before the attack, going, here's the enemy, they're bad, we better go into Afghanistan.
[00:43:04.539 --> 00:43:09.222]  Remember all the newscasts with the Taliban blowing up the Buddhist statues and all that?
[00:43:09.442 --> 00:43:09.922]  Sure I do.
[00:43:10.443 --> 00:43:14.726]  Very well, right, with the rocket-propelled grenade that blew up the two giant statues, yes, I do remember that.
[00:43:14.746 --> 00:43:19.389]  And they said, oh, they're mean to women, oh, they're bad, oh, they're terrorists, they're about to attack us, get ready.
[00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:27.195]  I mean, and I'm not saying they're good or bad, I'm saying they're bad, folks, but the point is, is that, is they introduced the bad man before they did it.
[00:43:28.075 --> 00:43:31.738]  Yeah, and then... I mean, has Bin Laden controlled ABC and NBC and Fox?
[00:43:32.019 --> 00:43:33.040]  And all the news media?
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.020]  No, not at all.
[00:43:34.381 --> 00:43:38.384]  And speaking of which, I guess we're going to see that vaudeville of a debate take place.
[00:43:38.504 --> 00:43:41.567]  I like to call it theatrical political theater tonight.
[00:43:41.687 --> 00:43:43.109]  Well, you gotta love Derry Brownfield.
[00:43:43.129 --> 00:43:43.889]  He does a great job.
[00:43:43.929 --> 00:43:49.494]  But maybe Derry hasn't read the mainstream news articles where they admit... Because I heard Derry today going, well, it's a stage debate.
[00:43:49.554 --> 00:43:50.675]  The caller said, well, it's stage.
[00:43:50.695 --> 00:43:51.336]  And he said, yeah, but...
[00:43:51.934 --> 00:43:54.556]  You know, I don't think their, you know, their questions are staged.
[00:43:54.896 --> 00:43:57.317]  Ten months ago, they started negotiations.
[00:43:57.397 --> 00:44:06.723]  It's gone on since 86, and with every debate, they negotiate down to every question, what can be raised in the answer, and what can be raised in the follow-up.
[00:44:06.783 --> 00:44:10.345]  It's all negotiated down to every word they say!
[00:44:10.505 --> 00:44:11.946]  That is precisely correct, Alex.
[00:44:12.006 --> 00:44:12.527]  That's admitted!
[00:44:12.567 --> 00:44:13.567]  It's not like it's a secret!
[00:44:13.587 --> 00:44:14.908]  Questions are known well beforehand.
[00:44:14.948 --> 00:44:17.350]  These are not spontaneous and organic debates.
[00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.331]  This is not Lincoln versus Douglas.
[00:44:20.595 --> 00:44:22.197]  Or Nixon versus Kennedy.
[00:44:22.217 --> 00:44:22.877]  Kennedy even.
[00:44:23.098 --> 00:44:24.139]  Right, not even that.
[00:44:24.599 --> 00:44:30.146]  So people should understand what you see tonight will be nothing more than theatrics and political theater.
[00:44:30.647 --> 00:44:37.395]  And as far as people thinking that we'll go to the Democrats and they'll save us from the Republicans, listen, they're all the same.
[00:44:37.495 --> 00:44:38.336]  Keep this in mind.
[00:44:39.144 --> 00:44:41.086]  There were lots of Democrats in that U.S.
[00:44:41.146 --> 00:44:45.810]  Congress that did not say anything, except for one maybe, about the U.S.
[00:44:45.851 --> 00:44:46.531]  Patriot Act.
[00:44:46.571 --> 00:44:47.472]  They all went along with it.
[00:44:47.492 --> 00:44:50.895]  Well, the guy that said something bad about it died in a plane crash.
[00:44:51.136 --> 00:44:51.796]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:52.397 --> 00:44:58.523]  What I've got to say on this issue is that we are entering the total police state, my friends.
[00:44:59.312 --> 00:45:02.433]  And if we stand up and are bold and say no, they'll back off.
[00:45:02.473 --> 00:45:03.714]  If we grovel to it, it's over.
[00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:06.355]  And I gotta say, folks are standing up, and that's good.
[00:45:06.775 --> 00:45:11.878]  Ashcroft likely to appeal Patriot ruling when he just mentioned, and this is out of the Associated Press, the U.S.
[00:45:11.898 --> 00:45:16.299]  Justice Department will probably appeal a New York District Court ruling that the Patriot Act violates the U.S.
[00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:16.960]  Constitution.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:21.942]  Attorney General John Ashcroft said Thursday, Ashcroft said he would study it upon returning to Washington.
[00:45:22.884 --> 00:45:23.584]  from the Netherlands.
[00:45:23.944 --> 00:45:26.005]  It's almost a certainty that it will be appealed.
[00:45:26.305 --> 00:45:29.586]  We believe that the act to be completely consistent with the United States Constitution.
[00:45:29.826 --> 00:45:41.090]  He told reporters at talks at the European Union officials on Wednesday, a district judge struck down the USA Patriot Act provision along the FBI to gather phone and web consumer records and then barring the service
[00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:42.611]  Good morning, Mr. Jones.
[00:45:42.872 --> 00:45:43.533]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:45:43.553 --> 00:45:45.215]  I appreciate that very much.
[00:45:58.567 --> 00:46:01.449]  Well, after that I may have missed earlier in the show, if you mentioned it.
[00:46:01.569 --> 00:46:04.571]  How did your day in court go yesterday?
[00:46:04.611 --> 00:46:07.593]  Did you go to court over the deal and try to shut down the access?
[00:46:07.653 --> 00:46:21.121]  Yeah, I just mentioned it, and I'm going to be getting into that in the third hour, but the judge that we went before, it wasn't a suit, it was just to depose them because they will not release records, even though we have the letter from the Attorney General saying they should release them.
[00:46:21.402 --> 00:46:23.403]  We had a city councilman's letter saying it,
[00:46:24.303 --> 00:46:29.007]  We had the Attorney General of the state of Texas saying it.
[00:46:29.347 --> 00:46:35.071]  We had their own board minutes saying they were making these changes and their own affidavits saying, swearing they weren't.
[00:46:35.351 --> 00:46:37.433]  And the judge said, I don't want to see any of it.
[00:46:37.893 --> 00:46:39.714]  She said, I am throwing this out.
[00:46:40.095 --> 00:46:42.156]  If you want to file a suit against them, go ahead.
[00:46:42.436 --> 00:46:43.477]  And so that's where it stands.
[00:46:44.078 --> 00:46:44.578]  Okay, good.
[00:46:44.598 --> 00:46:45.238]  I guess I missed it.
[00:46:45.258 --> 00:46:45.999]  I guess I was asleep.
[00:46:46.479 --> 00:46:46.739]  Anyway,
[00:46:48.052 --> 00:46:50.914]  I was listening to the guy who replaced you here at the Denver area.
[00:46:51.094 --> 00:46:52.855]  He had a pretty interesting show.
[00:46:52.915 --> 00:46:54.156]  I was still on 15-20 minutes.
[00:46:54.837 --> 00:46:57.698]  Congressman Tancredo was on, I believe it was last Friday, if memory serves.
[00:46:58.019 --> 00:47:00.180]  He was talking about immigration.
[00:47:01.341 --> 00:47:11.888]  And he was, he brought up that one of the CEOs from First Data apparently went to the press recently, I didn't see this, and said that they were going to move heaven and earth to vote out Tancredo.
[00:47:12.588 --> 00:47:15.070]  As you probably know, First Data is a parent company of
[00:47:15.737 --> 00:47:32.340]  Western Union, which does about fifteen or twenty billion dollars in money transfers from this country to Central and South America, I would imagine by a lot of people who are in this country illegally, so that cradle is making connection between illegal immigration and money being moved back to Central and South America.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.280]  No, I hear you.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:33.980]  It's a good point.
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:34.720]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:42.722]  And to be clear, our third hour is on that particular station you talk about, and we're also now on at night, and so we are on that station.
[00:47:43.602 --> 00:47:43.762]  Now,
[00:47:44.542 --> 00:47:47.764]  Just to explain and go over what he just said.
[00:47:48.724 --> 00:47:51.626]  Wells Fargo does tens of billions of dollars a year.
[00:47:51.686 --> 00:47:52.366]  I forget the number.
[00:47:52.386 --> 00:47:55.868]  I think it's something like $16 billion I read last year.
[00:47:56.388 --> 00:48:04.432]  And earlier this year, when we went and bullhorned him and shut down his press conference with the governor, Rick Perry, Vicente Fox came to Austin.
[00:48:04.472 --> 00:48:06.453]  We had a protest and went right up and bullhorned him.
[00:48:07.282 --> 00:48:10.344]  Right up against the gates of the Governor's Mansion.
[00:48:10.364 --> 00:48:16.068]  They used to arrest you for that, but folks sued them here locally and won lawsuits so they don't violate your First Amendment now.
[00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:17.690]  You don't need permits here in Austin.
[00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:24.735]  First Amendment's still alive and well because our listeners took action and sued their tails off and won three hundred thousand dollar a piece lawsuits.
[00:48:25.295 --> 00:48:27.056]  So that's a fight right there we won.
[00:48:28.077 --> 00:48:36.123]  And Fox was here giving an award to the police department openly for not following the law and not arresting illegals and letting them drive without driver's license, accepting the matricula card.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:47.768]  He was also here giving an award to Wells Fargo, because they've issued a new ID card that's being accepted by the state government, and he was here giving an award as well to Mr. Perry.
[00:48:48.148 --> 00:49:04.080]  Then it came out that Mr. Perry's head of border affairs is a Democrat, of course, and on top of it, this gentleman is a registered lobbyist with the Mexican government, which is a violation of state and federal law,
[00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:31.090]  uh... to be sitting on the state board while he does that the woman who brought this out in the newspaper in houston the journalist was threatened with arrest by the court saying it doesn't matter of those documents are public you can't report on them and she said well you can go to haiti's we're gonna report on it so that's the attempts they've been making here uh... so yes sir that's what's going on and i'm glad that Tom Tancredo is aware of that with some of the other companies uh... dan uh... in uh...
[00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:33.531]  Up in Canada.
[00:49:33.551 --> 00:49:34.571]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:49:34.891 --> 00:49:36.692]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:49:37.172 --> 00:49:37.612]  Yes.
[00:49:37.892 --> 00:49:40.473]  It's really an amazing program you're giving.
[00:49:40.493 --> 00:49:41.253]  Thank you.
[00:49:41.513 --> 00:49:51.477]  And I'm holding in front of me a printout, 9-11, the road to tyranny, sort of from internet.
[00:49:52.217 --> 00:50:01.080]  And it is also amazing that all of this information, if people are skillful, are accessible to anyone who has internet.
[00:50:02.392 --> 00:50:25.643]  Now, the question that I would like you to clear to me is that this so-called, the gangsters who want to establish the New World Order, aren't they mainly associated with the monetary world financial system?
[00:50:25.943 --> 00:50:26.243]  Yes.
[00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:29.785]  Okay, so basically
[00:50:31.454 --> 00:50:48.280]  Everything that's happening across the globe, from these minor wars to major disasters, is basically for the profit, and that's why we have a growing number of billionaires.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.661]  Tell you what, stay there!
[00:50:50.441 --> 00:50:51.541]  We'll come back, Dan.
[00:50:52.281 --> 00:50:53.122]  We'll talk about it.
[00:50:53.922 --> 00:50:54.562]  Stay with us.
[00:50:55.262 --> 00:50:56.963]  More news and information straight ahead.
[00:50:57.003 --> 00:50:58.504]  Your calls, a ton of news.
[00:50:58.964 --> 00:50:59.564]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.078 --> 00:51:05.402]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.602 --> 00:51:10.026]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.166 --> 00:51:14.569]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:15.951]  The New World Order.
[00:51:16.691 --> 00:51:17.132]  Panama.
[00:51:17.733 --> 00:51:21.957]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.017 --> 00:51:28.965]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:31.068]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.448 --> 00:51:41.892]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.072 --> 00:51:47.434]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:00.794 --> 00:52:06.016]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:14.259]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:14.499 --> 00:52:21.541]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:22.502 --> 00:52:28.986]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.186 --> 00:52:34.270]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:43.276]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:52:43.536 --> 00:52:46.839]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:54:03.828 --> 00:54:09.850]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:13.471]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:17.032 --> 00:54:22.974]  Alright, number one, the people you read about in Forbes as being the richest people in the world are not the richest people in the world.
[00:54:23.846 --> 00:54:32.112]  The globalists had billions of dollars in 1900 money that they put into tax-free corporations and they own and control almost everything.
[00:54:32.132 --> 00:54:39.697]  And then you've got low-level or mid-level minions who we hear about who are worth 50 billion bucks, like Bill Gates, and he's nothing compared to these people.
[00:54:40.517 --> 00:54:43.619]  The real ruling families own the banks that print the money.
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:46.381]  So it isn't about, quote, profits, it's about control.
[00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:51.965]  If a nation won't take central bank domination and having a globalist government installed,
[00:54:53.297 --> 00:54:56.858]  They'll claim their tariffs and go in and take them over, whether they're good, bad, or ugly.
[00:54:58.058 --> 00:55:04.359]  There's only maybe a dozen countries that are not totally globalist-controlled, and they're all in the process of being overthrown right now.
[00:55:04.739 --> 00:55:06.339]  And I'm not saying those governments are good either.
[00:55:06.619 --> 00:55:08.820]  Most governments are run by corrupt, power-hungry people.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.360]  That's the nature of human society.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:20.442]  But going back to what you just said, we have more, quote, billionaires on that list because the dollar has been devalued by almost 40 percent, and so
[00:55:21.607 --> 00:55:25.588]  Basically now they've just printed more money and so it looks like we've got more millionaires.
[00:55:26.449 --> 00:55:27.349]  But go ahead.
[00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:35.472]  Yeah Alex, but I mean, wouldn't you say that what you are struggling to save American people from, i.e.
[00:55:37.512 --> 00:55:47.596]  the complete dictatorship by some kind of mafioso kind of characters, shouldn't that be related to other regions of the globe?
[00:55:48.256 --> 00:55:48.656]  Because
[00:55:49.438 --> 00:55:52.886]  Even in other regions of the globe, people also need...
[00:55:53.777 --> 00:56:06.827]  To have a decent existence and not to be living like worms in a mudflat, to be stepped on and exploited by whoever is running them.
[00:56:07.087 --> 00:56:07.968]  No, I agree with you.
[00:56:08.168 --> 00:56:10.210]  I mean, we're trying to educate the world.
[00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:13.472]  Half the hits we get are from other countries on the websites.
[00:56:14.033 --> 00:56:15.554]  And this tyranny is global, sir.
[00:56:15.594 --> 00:56:19.657]  I just went over how there's only about 12 countries that the globalists don't totally dominate.
[00:56:19.897 --> 00:56:20.218]  I see.
[00:56:20.498 --> 00:56:23.060]  And just the last question, Alex.
[00:56:24.659 --> 00:56:36.108]  You are an extremely brave person, and I heard about the Stanley journalist, you know, being sort of crushed into his office and whatever.
[00:56:36.128 --> 00:56:45.076]  Now, but my question is, since you are located in Texas, how it is possible
[00:56:46.043 --> 00:57:04.836]  That these gangsters who are running and trying to subjugate everybody, how is it possible that you are able to at least show, to counteract their ideology, at least to expose them?
[00:57:04.976 --> 00:57:06.017]  How is that possible?
[00:57:06.037 --> 00:57:07.658]  Sure, let me answer the question thanks for the call.
[00:57:08.238 --> 00:57:14.963]  How was Samuel Adams able to call King George a traitor for five years in newspapers before they came after him?
[00:57:15.945 --> 00:57:17.507]  How was Patrick Henry able to do that?
[00:57:17.547 --> 00:57:18.989]  I'm not comparing myself to these men.
[00:57:19.569 --> 00:57:21.492]  How was George Washington able to do what he did?
[00:57:22.853 --> 00:57:25.296]  There are tens of thousands of us that are prominent.
[00:57:25.757 --> 00:57:27.479]  There are tens of thousands of websites.
[00:57:28.268 --> 00:57:32.010]  And if it's too obvious, if the globalists move too quickly, it'll backfire on them.
[00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:41.093]  Plus the globalists don't have enough evil minions, and the courts aren't totally corrupt yet, to just go ahead and pell-mell, start grabbing and torturing and secretly arresting people.
[00:57:41.493 --> 00:57:53.458]  Though that's why the dramas on TV all promote this, to condition the public that it's normal and okay, and whatever you see on these TV shows is being mimicked by laws they're trying to pass, and what talk show hosts like Michael Savage are promoting.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:58.443]  Putting people in camps who, quote, disagree with the government because they disagree with a government-aged terrorist.
[00:58:00.144 --> 00:58:02.706]  So, what I'm doing is dangerous.
[00:58:04.507 --> 00:58:05.889]  But, so what?
[00:58:06.529 --> 00:58:07.630]  I mean, that's just life.
[00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:08.591]  And I have courage.
[00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:10.932]  And number one, I believe that God protects me.
[00:58:11.613 --> 00:58:14.075]  And the prayers out there really help.
[00:58:14.555 --> 00:58:20.940]  But throughout history, in the midst of tyranny, people have stood up, and 20 years ago, they would kill you immediately for talking like this.
[00:58:21.616 --> 00:58:24.418]  Because the globalist takeover was in an embryonic stage.
[00:58:25.318 --> 00:58:28.541]  Now there's so many people waking up, and killing people didn't work.
[00:58:28.561 --> 00:58:32.803]  I mean, if they kill me, I'll just make me a martyr and a hundred more people will stand up.
[00:58:33.724 --> 00:58:35.345]  I mean, will I die of a heart attack?
[00:58:35.365 --> 00:58:36.326]  They call it natural causes.
[00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:37.326]  Will I die in a car wreck?
[00:58:38.227 --> 00:58:38.527]  Maybe.
[00:58:39.267 --> 00:58:41.509]  Back to the next decade or so, it's quite probable.
[00:58:41.889 --> 00:58:42.550]  But so what?
[00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:43.410]  Y'all only live once.
[00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:44.691]  And I'm not their slaves.
[00:58:44.951 --> 00:58:46.212]  And I will defend my family.
[00:58:46.572 --> 00:58:48.674]  I will not send them into the depths of slavery.
[00:58:48.694 --> 00:58:49.134]  What about you?
[00:58:51.476 --> 00:58:51.856]  Terrible!
[00:58:57.481 --> 00:58:58.122]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.782 --> 00:58:59.843]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.564 --> 00:59:01.685]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.325 --> 00:59:03.146]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.886 --> 00:59:04.787]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:09.211]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.651 --> 00:59:13.715]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.355 --> 00:59:23.238]  Alright, trying to defend humanity against the predatory New World Order criminals who are breeding us to be their slaves.
[00:59:24.138 --> 00:59:28.419]  The final stages of the architecture of worldwide tyranny are now upon us.
[00:59:28.479 --> 00:59:30.680]  It is the Pentagon's new map of enslavement.
[00:59:32.341 --> 00:59:43.685]  We will be the greatest slaves the world has ever known here within the Empire, not just the hapless third world populations that are going to be blasted into bits and forcibly inoculated.
[00:59:44.483 --> 00:59:47.566]  It's been a long time since I've spoken to you.
[00:59:47.626 --> 00:59:50.948]  I'm the one who sent you the article from the New American about Bush
[01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:16.733]  Speaking in London saying that the war in Iraq was too soon to end.
[01:00:17.573 --> 01:00:18.414]  Yes.
[01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:34.166]  But the reason I called, I had spoken to a worker at the Peruca campaign in Maryland and I mentioned the website and about the Bohemian Grove video and what have you.
[01:00:34.526 --> 01:00:39.910]  And suggested to them that maybe they might want to mention that in their campaign.
[01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:41.391]  I don't know if they will or not.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.022]  Well, they should talk about Skull and Bones.
[01:00:45.062 --> 01:00:47.584]  That's an occult organization everybody knows about now.
[01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:48.264]  Yeah.
[01:00:49.325 --> 01:01:01.215]  And, uh, the, uh... I wanted to get your opinion on whether you think that Bush's military record was leaked inaccurately on purpose that discredited anybody who would mention it later on.
[01:01:01.735 --> 01:01:05.178]  We can't document that, but it stinks heavily of that.
[01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:05.719]  Yeah.
[01:01:06.559 --> 01:01:12.064]  Okay, and I've just been calling him being a nuisance to these bohemian people.
[01:01:13.778 --> 01:01:20.743]  I've got the Bohemian Club number and a number to the actual Grove itself if you want those.
[01:01:21.684 --> 01:01:22.845]  So you've been calling them?
[01:01:22.985 --> 01:01:24.486]  Oh yeah.
[01:01:25.066 --> 01:01:26.207]  What do you say when you call?
[01:01:26.567 --> 01:01:40.638]  I called and I asked about how do you find out more information about the Grove and who's a member and of course they say in order to find out who's a member you have to become a member and the membership fees are something like $10,000 a year.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.461]  I'm a blue-collar guy.
[01:01:45.761 --> 01:01:47.262]  No, they are $10,000, you know.
[01:01:47.402 --> 01:01:57.806]  And the other thing I wanted to mention, hypothetically, of course, is that, you know, they're not the only people who can make these things, weapons.
[01:01:59.487 --> 01:02:05.169]  The details of microwave cannon are not that involved.
[01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:10.852]  All you need is a magnetron from a microwave oven and a bank of capacitors.
[01:02:12.884 --> 01:02:18.006]  Discharge the capacitors through the magnetron with microwave oven and there you go.
[01:02:18.886 --> 01:02:20.566]  Alright, well thank you for the call sir.
[01:02:21.066 --> 01:02:24.587]  Let me just bring up why I guess he mentioned that.
[01:02:25.268 --> 01:02:30.529]  They're going to mount on these blimps, not just ground penetrating radar to look through your walls, now one over D.C.
[01:02:30.569 --> 01:02:32.210]  They're going to be over every U.S.
[01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:36.191]  city, but also microwave guns just to make sure you behave yourselves.
[01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:42.974]  Again, they've got some wonderful things planned for our cities and they need microwave guns to control crowds from the air.
[01:02:43.475 --> 01:02:56.605]  You know, we're bad and this is freedom and the terrorists attack us because they hate our freedom and so they've got to get rid of all our freedom and in case you don't like being forcibly inoculated or going to the relocation center for your safety, we've got to mount these above all your cities.
[01:02:58.246 --> 01:02:58.426]  Why?
[01:02:58.507 --> 01:02:59.868]  It's the world of tomorrow.
[01:03:00.008 --> 01:03:05.392]  It's the world of the new freedom where we're all psychologically forcibly tested and forcibly drugged and
[01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:11.767]  Where the new economy is presence and surveillance owned by our global leaders and they're going to take good care of us.
[01:03:12.779 --> 01:03:25.769]  All right, when we get back, we're going to be talking to Sal Costello, and he's done an incredible job of the Austin Toll Party, exposing how we're going to have 6,000 miles of toll roads in Texas compared to 7,000 nationwide.
[01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:37.258]  Our so-called conservative governor, Rick Perry, wants to have Austin have more toll roads than any other city in the country, and this is coming to a town near you, unfortunately, so this is very, very important.
[01:03:37.278 --> 01:03:38.039]  This is all part of the
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.322]  Cracking and Taxation Grid.
[01:03:40.843 --> 01:03:41.544]  So stay with us.
[01:03:41.624 --> 01:03:42.926]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:43.547 --> 01:03:46.832]  And we'll also of course take more of your calls for those that are holding.
[01:03:47.713 --> 01:03:51.199]  As well, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[01:03:53.067 --> 01:03:54.548]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:54.728 --> 01:03:57.829]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:57.949 --> 01:04:01.851]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:06.132]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.473 --> 01:04:10.234]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.334 --> 01:04:12.195]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:20.444]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.604 --> 01:04:23.667]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:23.847 --> 01:04:26.711]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.191 --> 01:04:33.318]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:33.838 --> 01:04:37.619]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:04:53.658 --> 01:04:58.142]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:58.502 --> 01:05:02.586]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:02.886 --> 01:05:03.427]  We listened.
[01:05:03.747 --> 01:05:08.711]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:09.492]  We listened.
[01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:12.915]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:13.335 --> 01:05:13.856]  We listened.
[01:05:14.316 --> 01:05:18.378]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:18.758 --> 01:05:19.258]  We listened.
[01:05:19.598 --> 01:05:24.840]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:26.601]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:26.961 --> 01:05:34.344]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[01:07:00.634 --> 01:07:01.735]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.395 --> 01:07:03.216]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.977 --> 01:07:04.858]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.878 --> 01:07:09.222]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.722 --> 01:07:13.866]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.407 --> 01:07:22.234]  All right, more on the new National ID Card Super Patriot Act bill, what's happening in Iraq, the shady
[01:07:23.465 --> 01:07:25.247]  Edwards debate tonight.
[01:07:25.507 --> 01:07:28.990]  Even the mainstream news is billing it as Darth Vader vs. Robin.
[01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:30.932]  I mean, how ridiculous.
[01:07:32.033 --> 01:07:34.555]  So we'll talk about that as well and I promise to get to your calls.
[01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:37.998]  Sal Castillo is an amazing individual.
[01:07:38.038 --> 01:07:38.959]  He's done his homework.
[01:07:39.519 --> 01:07:41.841]  AustinTollParty.com is the website.
[01:07:42.622 --> 01:07:45.064]  He has owned his own advertising and marketing company for 13 years.
[01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:49.397]  Costello and Company, and he has lived in Austin for five years.
[01:07:49.437 --> 01:07:51.838]  Before that he lived in Florida, North Carolina, New York.
[01:07:52.178 --> 01:07:54.219]  He knows about transportation from different areas.
[01:07:55.339 --> 01:08:00.041]  And talking to him during the break, he agrees with my summation of what these toll roads are all about.
[01:08:01.021 --> 01:08:07.244]  But he says he doesn't get a lot into that because the average person, even though it's in the news, doesn't read the newspaper and finds it hard to believe.
[01:08:07.344 --> 01:08:13.566]  But, in 1998, the National Traffic Safety Law was passed.
[01:08:14.128 --> 01:08:25.052]  And it's to set up toll roads nationwide that will be manned by checkpoints, with quote, forced volunteers from the high schools to graduate, part of AmeriCorps and SecurCorps, and of course Homeland Security came along.
[01:08:25.292 --> 01:08:29.614]  This is all in my film, Police Fate 2000, that I released in 1999.
[01:08:30.754 --> 01:08:37.957]  And we go over the plan and the K-Tag, and how the transponders in your car will track and trace you, now that, where you go through the electronic toll roads,
[01:08:39.743 --> 01:08:43.984]  We get into, then, how it's used to tax and trace and control.
[01:08:44.044 --> 01:08:45.925]  Then I have articles from two years ago.
[01:08:45.945 --> 01:08:47.345]  We're in San Francisco.
[01:08:47.405 --> 01:08:50.766]  They use the K-Tag transponder in the car that you have to take.
[01:08:52.206 --> 01:09:00.268]  And how that transponder, they put up radio readers around the city with your ID number on it to go ahead and track what you're doing on top of just one of the toll roads.
[01:09:00.648 --> 01:09:06.870]  Then about a month ago, the Chicago Tribune had an article where the mayor there in Chicago
[01:09:08.129 --> 01:09:09.711]  And now they're talking about statewide.
[01:09:09.731 --> 01:09:14.318]  It's saying it will be double if you don't have the transponder.
[01:09:14.898 --> 01:09:15.739]  So this is what they do.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:21.928]  They say, well, it's $2 if you don't have the transponder and $0.50 or $1 if you do have the transponder.
[01:09:22.529 --> 01:09:27.430]  And when I was in New York a few weeks ago, for the Republican National Convention, we would take cabs.
[01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:30.251]  And when you went through a toll road, it would be $7.
[01:09:32.812 --> 01:09:35.152]  That was the highest of tolls.
[01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:35.832]  Others were $5, $4.
[01:09:37.293 --> 01:09:39.473]  The smallest toll we saw was $2.
[01:09:40.774 --> 01:09:44.035]  And one cabbie had a transponder on his dash.
[01:09:44.135 --> 01:09:46.455]  He had to pull through the lane that had all the traffic.
[01:09:46.475 --> 01:09:49.416]  Everybody else was speeding through, and he had to pay even more.
[01:09:50.225 --> 01:09:57.211]  And he goes, oh, it's about 40% more when you don't have the transponder, but I have to go fill it up with a couple thousand dollars more.
[01:09:57.771 --> 01:09:59.473]  That's what I spend just in a few weeks.
[01:10:00.173 --> 01:10:01.854]  And of course, they pass that on to you.
[01:10:01.874 --> 01:10:07.279]  Now, that's a cabbie, granted, who's going through those tolls because they do so much driving.
[01:10:07.619 --> 01:10:09.080]  But they've done an estimation.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.863]  It's been in the local paper, $2,000 a year for the average Austinite.
[01:10:12.903 --> 01:10:16.887]  I was talking to Sal during the first break there when we got him on.
[01:10:16.907 --> 01:10:18.808]  He said, well, our numbers are $1,800 a year.
[01:10:21.511 --> 01:10:27.222]  $1,800 a year in Austin, and that's with a conservative toll plan they've already passed, this unelected board.
[01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.028]  So this is going to be everywhere.
[01:10:30.048 --> 01:10:32.573]  You're going to have federal, state, county, and city tolls.
[01:10:34.008 --> 01:10:40.512]  And the Feds are talking about going to a national system, making you take a satellite tracker box in your car that you pay for when you get your tags.
[01:10:41.093 --> 01:10:50.379]  All the new cars for the last eight years, by the way, have the plug-ins and a computerized ignition made for the satellite tracker, so it's already been built in for the whole infrastructure.
[01:10:50.639 --> 01:10:53.181]  The official federal plan that I broke six years ago
[01:10:53.941 --> 01:11:04.990]  With a member of the Legislature of Wisconsin who was on the federal board over this who was warning people that there was a plan by 2005 to start national tolling around the country.
[01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:06.691]  Now Oregon has announced they want to do it.
[01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:08.913]  New York has announced they want to do it.
[01:11:08.953 --> 01:11:10.814]  So it's actually happening folks.
[01:11:11.135 --> 01:11:12.536]  Your car will be a taxi.
[01:11:13.276 --> 01:11:20.363]  London has passed it now, where they have cameras that scan your license plate and send you bills that you've got to pay.
[01:11:20.763 --> 01:11:29.591]  They say people are cheating on those, and so they're going to make you take a transponder to be radio-read off of this, or a satellite tracker box.
[01:11:29.831 --> 01:11:31.933]  So we're just a few years away from this.
[01:11:31.953 --> 01:11:36.717]  They had it slated for 2005, I'd say they're a year or two behind, but it's happening.
[01:11:38.107 --> 01:11:38.788]  It's happening.
[01:11:38.848 --> 01:11:42.851]  Now that's the big, dark, scary plan of the infrastructure.
[01:11:43.131 --> 01:11:46.614]  To give you the actual nuts and bolts of a model city.
[01:11:46.854 --> 01:11:53.019]  What your city is going to be like, if we don't stop this in places like Austin, is Sal Costello.
[01:11:53.299 --> 01:11:56.062]  Sal, I am honored to have you on with us.
[01:11:56.362 --> 01:11:59.044]  Thank you, I'm happy to be on.
[01:11:59.584 --> 01:12:02.707]  You mentioned the timing of this, and the first
[01:12:03.726 --> 01:12:19.519]  The first one of these toll roads for this toll plan that was passed is going to be placed just a couple miles from my home on a bridge that's a mile and a half long toll and we've already paid for the bridge, about ten million dollars, we've paid for it.
[01:12:19.539 --> 01:12:22.501]  They're going to put a toll booth on there in March of 2005.
[01:12:22.762 --> 01:12:30.568]  Now they're going to put a toll 400 yards from me, from my home, right there where Mopac hits William Cannon.
[01:12:32.684 --> 01:12:33.324]  That's the bridge.
[01:12:33.705 --> 01:12:34.745]  Yes, so you live near me.
[01:12:35.025 --> 01:12:35.185]  Yes.
[01:12:35.746 --> 01:12:43.069]  And to go basically anywhere, according to their public map, now they're announcing they're going to put even more in, to go more than a mile anywhere I'll go through a toll.
[01:12:43.309 --> 01:12:45.190]  Oh yeah, they've got them all over town.
[01:12:45.965 --> 01:12:47.966]  And, uh, it's disturbing.
[01:12:48.046 --> 01:12:50.946]  What's really... I want to give people proof.
[01:12:51.006 --> 01:12:52.367]  This is the solid proof.
[01:12:52.387 --> 01:12:56.408]  Yeah, let's go over the whole background of this, who the players are, these unelected boards.
[01:12:56.688 --> 01:13:05.050]  I mean, you know, my audience is very intelligent, very advanced, but for those that just joined us, let's give them the whole nuts and bolts presentation.
[01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:12.891]  Well, the head-scratcher in this whole thing, if you want to boil it right down, is these boards that some of them are elected folks.
[01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:15.452]  They're like state representatives, they're county commissioners,
[01:13:16.391 --> 01:13:21.186]  And our MPO, it's called an MPO, there's 23 of them.
[01:13:22.722 --> 01:13:27.624]  And they asked us for our feedback, they extended the deadline, and then they put a deadline on the feedback.
[01:13:27.664 --> 01:13:29.565]  They wanted to know, do you want these, do you not want these?
[01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:35.687]  But, but, but, but, they're on, but sir, they're on though, let's make this clear, unelected regional boards.
[01:13:36.087 --> 01:13:41.429]  No, this board is elected, but then... No, I know, but I'm talking about the larger statewide board, but go ahead.
[01:13:41.689 --> 01:13:50.132]  Okay, but then the RMA, the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority, they're the ones that are going to run the toll roads.
[01:13:50.353 --> 01:13:51.313]  They are not elected.
[01:13:52.239 --> 01:13:54.200]  The one person is appointed by the governor.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.081]  And then they pull in other people.
[01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:58.121]  I don't know what's going on there.
[01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:02.823]  But the thing that bugs me is they asked us for our feedback.
[01:14:02.863 --> 01:14:03.824]  They gave us a deadline.
[01:14:03.844 --> 01:14:05.945]  93% of the people said no.
[01:14:05.965 --> 01:14:05.945]  93%.
[01:14:05.985 --> 01:14:09.706]  And that was here in Austin.
[01:14:09.726 --> 01:14:12.528]  And in Houston, 98% said no.
[01:14:13.128 --> 01:14:17.209]  And these local officials voted for it anyway.
[01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:20.651]  Now these folks are supposed to represent us.
[01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:22.790]  And they've ignored us.
[01:14:23.631 --> 01:14:34.274]  And that's one of the reasons why we did AustinsWholeParty.com and when people go to step one and they hit one button, they send a message to over 200 state officials to tell them no.
[01:14:34.814 --> 01:14:40.696]  To tell them that we're watching them, we're going to bump them out of office, they need to stop these plans.
[01:14:41.741 --> 01:14:47.765]  Now, just a few years ago, if 93% of people or 98% of people were against something, they wouldn't pass it.
[01:14:48.206 --> 01:14:58.013]  But now we have those magical no-record voting machines, owned by Clear Channel here in Austin, hardener civics, so magically now they're very, very arrogant, but that's a whole other subject.
[01:14:58.433 --> 01:15:08.440]  For people that just joined us, the maps on your website, their official map, go over how this plan developed and how many toll roads we're going to have and how this is different from other toll systems.
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:13.301]  Well, if you go to AustinTollPay.com, you'll see the map as soon as you go there.
[01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:15.422]  But it's all over the city.
[01:15:15.522 --> 01:15:24.544]  And the disturbing thing about this is no other city in the country has shifted its daily highways all over the city to toll ways.
[01:15:25.045 --> 01:15:27.085]  And in Austin, that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:15:27.385 --> 01:15:31.826]  They're shifting all our daily highways except for the one Interstate 35.
[01:15:32.747 --> 01:15:33.207]  Everything.
[01:15:33.327 --> 01:15:34.167]  We're talking about 183, 71, Mopac,
[01:15:38.352 --> 01:15:39.672]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:15:39.712 --> 01:15:40.213]  It's everything.
[01:15:40.913 --> 01:15:42.013]  And it's disturbing.
[01:15:42.193 --> 01:15:48.274]  And there's multiple toll roads at every entrance point by other highways coming into the region.
[01:15:48.675 --> 01:15:48.875]  Yes.
[01:15:50.755 --> 01:15:50.955]  Yeah.
[01:15:52.556 --> 01:16:06.899]  And some of the more disturbing parts of the plan is that they are converting roads that we paid for, some of them being built right now, over a hundred million dollars worth, they're going to just put
[01:16:07.637 --> 01:16:08.397]  We're good to go.
[01:16:36.127 --> 01:16:39.669]  So I had to learn about the whole plan when I didn't want to, and I realized what was happening.
[01:16:40.249 --> 01:16:49.235]  And I wanted to use my skills as a marketing and design professional to communicate with the rest of Austin, if I possibly could, to tell them what was happening.
[01:16:49.715 --> 01:16:54.438]  Now, to describe this properly for folks, you've got to really see the map to understand the full magnitude.
[01:16:54.858 --> 01:17:04.544]  In the past, they'd say we're building a loop around the city, and for ten years, to pay for it, it's going to have toll roads, and then when it was paid for, they took the toll booths out of it.
[01:17:05.234 --> 01:17:25.719]  Okay, now they're taking all the existing major roads and side roads and everything, and they are converting them to toll roads, and then we first hear it's going to be 7 toll roads, then 9 toll roads, then 15 toll roads, and then the plans get bigger and bigger, and oh, it's going to be all of Central Texas, and oh, it's going to link up with San Antonio and Dallas.
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:28.120]  I mean, how big is this thing really going to get?
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.421]  Well, they've got the city plan,
[01:17:31.841 --> 01:17:35.143]  That are happening now in the cities and even small towns have called me.
[01:17:35.644 --> 01:17:40.287]  Like Bastrop, I believe it is, where they've got one main highway where they're placing a toll on that.
[01:17:40.767 --> 01:17:50.694]  But there's also the Trans-Texas Corridor Tollways, which is Perry's 4,000 mile long connection from city to city.
[01:17:51.434 --> 01:17:55.457]  And that thing is a quarter mile wide in their tollways.
[01:17:55.497 --> 01:17:57.178]  But what's different about these tollways
[01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:09.784]  And the Austin plan, then tollways that have been done throughout the history of our country, is those tollways before Austin have always been financed with 80% investor dollars.
[01:18:10.964 --> 01:18:16.766]  But what's happening here is they're only using 19% investor dollars, and the rest are our tax dollars.
[01:18:16.806 --> 01:18:19.426]  But then the private investors get the lion's share of the profit.
[01:18:19.786 --> 01:18:21.407]  So it's really corporate fascism.
[01:18:21.427 --> 01:18:26.848]  So what happens is they take existing roads and just throw a gate up on it where they're going to tax you.
[01:18:27.566 --> 01:18:27.966]  That's right.
[01:18:28.066 --> 01:18:36.792]  And before they had, because the investors were putting money up, 80%, they had to do traffic and revenue studies to see if they were feasible, if they made sense.
[01:18:37.313 --> 01:18:38.693]  But now they're not doing those things.
[01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:40.435]  They're just plopping them down wherever they want them.
[01:18:41.055 --> 01:18:42.796]  I would call this corporate looting.
[01:18:43.597 --> 01:18:52.282]  When I get back, we'll give you more details of this plan that's coming to a town near you and will engulf Texas.

[01:20:53.887 --> 01:20:55.688]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:20:56.188 --> 01:20:59.590]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.790]  Let's update.
[01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:04.731]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:21:06.644 --> 01:21:09.105]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:21:09.785 --> 01:21:10.725]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:13.086]  dollar was worth 17% more than the euro.
[01:21:13.606 --> 01:21:14.506]  Today, the U.S.
[01:21:14.546 --> 01:21:16.767]  dollar is worth 28% less than the euro.
[01:21:17.167 --> 01:21:18.688]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:21:19.268 --> 01:21:21.248]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[01:21:22.609 --> 01:21:27.470]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:29.211]  Gold is moving.
[01:21:29.471 --> 01:21:30.631]  Equities are treading water.
[01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:33.572]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:21:34.207 --> 01:21:35.588]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:21:36.029 --> 01:21:37.730]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:21:38.151 --> 01:21:40.133]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[01:22:57.122 --> 01:22:58.624]  This show is documented.
[01:22:59.164 --> 01:23:01.927]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.368 --> 01:23:07.553]  Alright, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:07.593 --> 01:23:14.320]  We're talking to Sal Castillo, who is doing just an amazing job exposing these toll road scams.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.701]  And again, years ago I warned you of this plan.
[01:23:16.741 --> 01:23:24.806]  Every major highway, every major city road, to get into cities as part of a smart growth plan, paying tolls to get in, paying tolls to get out.
[01:23:25.147 --> 01:23:26.107]  That's what this does.
[01:23:26.207 --> 01:23:27.368]  A ring around the city.
[01:23:27.728 --> 01:23:33.852]  I was at a smart growth conference in 98 where they had maps very similar to the ones that the state has now released.
[01:23:34.292 --> 01:23:39.996]  And to clarify what I was saying earlier about unelected boards, to clarify that I was talking to Sal during the break.
[01:23:40.656 --> 01:23:45.499]  Our city has signed over its authority to this unelected board.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:48.021]  Can you elaborate on that, Sal?
[01:23:48.581 --> 01:23:48.862]  Yeah.
[01:23:49.022 --> 01:23:54.425]  Throughout Texas, most of these authorities have been produced.
[01:23:54.945 --> 01:23:55.966]  They are not elected.
[01:23:56.506 --> 01:23:57.787]  They're RMAs.
[01:23:58.027 --> 01:24:00.549]  Ours is called the CTRMA.
[01:24:02.954 --> 01:24:09.697]  The head of each RMA is appointed by Rick Perry, and then they sort of fill in the slots with whoever they want.
[01:24:10.637 --> 01:24:26.384]  So basically this board will sort of get these toll roads built in a very short period of time, and then we believe that with the language that was passed in House Bill 3588, that they're going to sell or lease
[01:24:27.498 --> 01:24:27.979]  Our roads.
[01:24:28.019 --> 01:24:34.368]  They literally have the... Now it's legally okay for them to sell or lease our roads.
[01:24:34.952 --> 01:24:36.113]  To private corporations.
[01:24:36.433 --> 01:24:40.636]  Now, and the city's signed over its control, uh, now to these people.
[01:24:40.656 --> 01:24:42.658]  And understand, folks, this is the new world order.
[01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:53.886]  This is corporate fascism, where they socialize our wealth, take it from us, build the infrastructure, and then hand it over, uh, to, uh, the oligarchs, just like they have it in Russia.
[01:24:54.407 --> 01:24:55.307]  This is the system.
[01:24:55.407 --> 01:25:01.472]  And for those that just joined us and understand this, I've been through Kansas and other states where, for a hundred miles,
[01:25:02.353 --> 01:25:03.394]  You cannot exit.
[01:25:03.614 --> 01:25:06.195]  All you see is small towns that are ghost towns.
[01:25:06.536 --> 01:25:09.077]  They've got big concrete barriers and fences.
[01:25:09.417 --> 01:25:12.799]  The McDonald's and gas stations are built in the middle of the road.
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:14.741]  You cannot exit.
[01:25:15.301 --> 01:25:17.722]  And it literally shuts off all the communities.
[01:25:17.983 --> 01:25:20.204]  This is part also of that big U.N.
[01:25:20.604 --> 01:25:22.045]  UNESCO plan, folks.
[01:25:22.325 --> 01:25:25.207]  This is how they're going to force us off of the rural areas.
[01:25:25.567 --> 01:25:27.588]  And we were talking during the break about this, Sal.
[01:25:27.828 --> 01:25:31.731]  Can you tell folks about these trans, you know, Texas and other corridors?
[01:25:32.131 --> 01:25:50.485]  Yeah, I don't know as much about the Trans-Texas Corridors as some others, but I have learned that there's 4,000 miles in the plan, and it's from city to city, and I do know also that they will shut out and kill small towns, because there's going to be no off-ramps to these small towns.
[01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:57.030]  But, you know, just this quarter-mile wide tollway that is built with our money.
[01:25:59.211 --> 01:26:04.533]  It's kind of like a bigger version of what's happening in our cities and towns throughout Texas.
[01:26:05.033 --> 01:26:09.635]  We do have a very few elected officials that are fighting for us.
[01:26:10.155 --> 01:26:11.455]  One of them is Terry Keele.
[01:26:12.415 --> 01:26:27.320]  He has literally asked the Comptroller, on Friday it was in the news, him and Brewster McCracken, asked the Comptroller to do an audit of our CTRMA because they want to spend one and a half million dollars
[01:26:27.921 --> 01:26:30.918]  They've already given these contracts out for public relations.
[01:26:31.855 --> 01:26:33.376]  And that's our gas tax dollars.
[01:26:33.557 --> 01:26:35.418]  That's money that could be used for building roads.
[01:26:35.438 --> 01:26:37.400]  And so now it's going to be propaganda money.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.404]  Again, 93% in Austin, 98% in Houston.
[01:26:42.924 --> 01:26:43.865]  No one's for this.
[01:26:43.905 --> 01:26:45.346]  Not liberals, not conservatives.
[01:26:45.627 --> 01:26:52.112]  And then we have Governor Rick Perry with this corporate looting to hand our roads over to private corporations.
[01:26:52.793 --> 01:26:53.673]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:53.733 --> 01:26:57.657]  And they spent years in the special interest, spent millions of dollars
[01:26:58.453 --> 01:26:59.635]  Changing our laws.
[01:27:00.115 --> 01:27:05.102]  And the 3588, by the way, was Mike Kruze, who is in Round Rock.
[01:27:05.162 --> 01:27:06.805]  He's a state rep there.
[01:27:07.225 --> 01:27:14.055]  He's the one that took Rick Perry's ball, this 3588 House Bill, and passed it.
[01:27:15.345 --> 01:27:22.869]  But hopefully this January, February, Keele and others will fight to amend or rescind this House Bill 3588.
[01:27:22.909 --> 01:27:25.310]  Well, this is what they do.
[01:27:25.330 --> 01:27:35.595]  6,000 miles statewide, 4,000 just on the state and federal highways, 2,000 in the cities, Austin being just an incredible beta test of this.
[01:27:35.655 --> 01:27:36.835]  Folks, you've got to see the maps of this.
[01:27:36.855 --> 01:27:39.797]  You won't be able to get in or out without paying tolls or go anywhere.
[01:27:40.457 --> 01:27:42.278]  Literally, I'm going to be a prisoner in my house.
[01:27:42.838 --> 01:27:44.679]  They're saying it's going to destroy neighborhoods.
[01:27:45.319 --> 01:27:51.841]  This is a nightmare, and I really don't have words to describe how draconian this is.
[01:27:52.041 --> 01:27:56.763]  Well, I've got to also tell you that I've gotten emails from folks that have been trying to sell their homes.
[01:27:57.715 --> 01:28:02.701]  Uh, and they've had to reduce their home that's a $600,000 house to $500,000.
[01:28:02.961 --> 01:28:10.329]  They still can't sell it because people, when they look at it, they go, it's a beautiful house, nice and quiet, but the toll roads are coming down the street and we don't want to buy it.
[01:28:13.112 --> 01:28:15.735]  So it's hurting home values.
[01:28:16.585 --> 01:28:21.168]  And that's why I'll ask everybody who's listening to go to austintollparty.com and do step one.
[01:28:21.208 --> 01:28:22.569]  You don't have to live in Austin.
[01:28:22.989 --> 01:28:26.612]  This thing goes to all state representatives throughout the whole state.
[01:28:26.692 --> 01:28:31.155]  And if we can stop it here in Austin, there's a better chance we can stop it in other cities.
[01:28:31.855 --> 01:28:33.776]  Well, it's happening now around the country.
[01:28:33.797 --> 01:28:35.898]  I mean, this is the model, folks.
[01:28:35.958 --> 01:28:37.739]  This is the New World Order corporate looting.
[01:28:37.759 --> 01:28:39.740]  We'll come back, get more into this, and take your calls.
[01:28:40.421 --> 01:28:41.462]  Stay with us, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:28:43.306 --> 01:28:46.290]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:49.896]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.249 --> 01:28:55.731]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:28:55.931 --> 01:29:03.278]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:29:03.578 --> 01:29:08.003]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:29:08.263 --> 01:29:18.113]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:22.515]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:29:22.855 --> 01:29:25.336]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:29:25.356 --> 01:29:31.558]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:29:31.818 --> 01:29:33.379]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:29:33.639 --> 01:29:34.520]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:37.601]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.

[01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:43.004]  It's powerful stuff.

[01:31:45.219 --> 01:31:48.862]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:48.882 --> 01:31:50.364]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:26.018]  Whether you're listening in Pensacola, Florida, or Albuquerque, New Mexico, or Denver, Colorado, or Los Angeles, California, Rhode Island, the federal plan is every inch of road in this country that is state, federal, or local will be taxed and controlled.
[01:32:26.078 --> 01:32:26.858]  It's the official plan.
[01:32:26.878 --> 01:32:27.778]  I've known it for six years.
[01:32:28.558 --> 01:32:30.179]  I made a film about it five years ago.
[01:32:31.403 --> 01:32:41.227]  Spent about 15-20 minutes of the two hour, five minute film, Police State 2000 on this and the federal plans up on the screen showing you them.
[01:32:43.008 --> 01:32:47.090]  And I've been all over this country, folks, and the worst stuff I've seen is up in Kansas and Missouri.
[01:32:47.690 --> 01:32:53.613]  Those toll roads, I-35 coming up out of Texas and Oklahoma.
[01:32:53.753 --> 01:32:56.194]  And folks, you can't even get off on another road.
[01:32:56.334 --> 01:32:57.815]  I mean, literally, you'll drive for an hour.
[01:32:58.590 --> 01:33:07.916]  And you see all these big old ghost towns and courthouses to your left and your right and all these old shut down gas stations and nice farmhouses shut down, boarded up.
[01:33:07.976 --> 01:33:09.117]  I mean, it's just gone.
[01:33:09.697 --> 01:33:12.999]  Because you're on this toll road and all the exit ramps have been cut off.
[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:15.901]  They've built our society around the automobile.
[01:33:15.941 --> 01:33:16.862]  We're sprawled out.
[01:33:16.902 --> 01:33:17.702]  We're spread out.
[01:33:18.283 --> 01:33:20.624]  And now they're going to jack the oil prices up to $6 a gallon.
[01:33:20.644 --> 01:33:22.605]  They've said they're going to do it in the next five years.
[01:33:23.586 --> 01:33:25.507]  The oil company's making record profits.
[01:33:25.527 --> 01:33:26.788]  This is all by design, folks.
[01:33:28.634 --> 01:33:30.335]  They say they're going to tax in traces.
[01:33:30.896 --> 01:33:38.060]  And here in Austin, Texas, the newspaper said $2,000 a year on average for the average family driving their car.
[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:45.003]  Our guest, who's been on the vanguard, cutting edge of exposing this, says it's going to be $1,800.
[01:33:46.639 --> 01:34:04.053]  Folks, and then the state highways and everything else to get anywhere, toll roads which also serve as surveillance and checkpoints, and then track you with your transponder with your ID number on it everywhere you go and what you do, and they said if you run these things three times, they're going to come arrest you.
[01:34:04.794 --> 01:34:05.935]  That's been in the news as well.
[01:34:06.275 --> 01:34:13.221]  So this is happening all over, but Texas, with our so-called conservative governor, Rick Perry, doing this to us.
[01:34:14.562 --> 01:34:19.605]  We're about to go back to Sal and then we'll go to Roger and Chris and Kim and many others.
[01:34:19.625 --> 01:34:25.168]  If you want to talk about this or other issues about transportation and taxation, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:25.208 --> 01:34:33.592]  And all the small towns off state interstates or federal interstates, they will shut you down.
[01:34:33.612 --> 01:34:34.213]  Do you understand?
[01:34:34.513 --> 01:34:36.874]  You will be shut down.
[01:34:37.034 --> 01:34:37.614]  I've been there.
[01:34:37.875 --> 01:34:38.415]  I've seen it.
[01:34:40.376 --> 01:34:41.938]  You want your car to be turned into a taxi?
[01:34:42.538 --> 01:34:44.800]  The roads you already paid for five times over?
[01:34:45.541 --> 01:34:46.822]  Get ready for it, my friends.
[01:34:48.144 --> 01:34:53.869]  Now before we go back to our guest, at austintollroads.com, I have made 11 films.
[01:34:55.854 --> 01:35:02.136]  My 11th film, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004 is out.
[01:35:02.517 --> 01:35:08.479]  It shows how Bush and Kerry are identical on real policies, how they're cousins, how they're members of the same secret organizations.
[01:35:09.019 --> 01:35:11.660]  We get into the whole police state they're setting up, 9-11.
[01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:13.921]  It's a great new video, 90 minutes long, 1995.
[01:35:14.941 --> 01:35:20.904]  I also have my two 9-11 films, 9-11 The Road to Tyranny and The Masters of Terror, that document what really happened on 9-11.
[01:35:22.392 --> 01:35:27.114]  And then we also carry George Humphrey, former Austin City Council member's documentary about 9-11.
[01:35:27.134 --> 01:35:28.915]  9-11, The Great Illusion.
[01:35:29.556 --> 01:35:32.757]  Eric Huffschmid's video, 9-11, The Great Deception.
[01:35:33.237 --> 01:35:35.198]  We have all those on VHS and DVD.
[01:35:35.819 --> 01:35:38.960]  Available at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:46.424]  Just go to the safe, secure online shopping cart and watch video clips or read about the different films, look at the different specials we have to offer and take action.
[01:35:47.509 --> 01:35:54.573]  Or simply call toll free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:35:59.916 --> 01:36:00.197]  Get them.

[01:36:01.337 --> 01:36:02.538]  Get them out to opinion makers.
[01:36:02.958 --> 01:36:05.260]  Cause this revolution of understanding.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.201]  Take the blinders off people's eyes.
[01:36:07.241 --> 01:36:08.261]  These videos can do it.
[01:36:08.281 --> 01:36:08.341]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:14.964 --> 01:36:21.567]  Or just write to me, I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:36:23.428 --> 01:36:34.092]  And all of my videos, and all the other videos I mentioned, and my weekly TV reports, and my best radio interviews, this one will be there, are posted at PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, folks.
[01:36:35.473 --> 01:36:37.894]  Okay, let's go back to our guest.
[01:36:39.261 --> 01:36:51.029]  Let's talk about how they get local officials to sign over their authority and perpetuity to these unelected state boards that then hand it all over to private corporations who've paid for their campaigns.
[01:36:51.329 --> 01:36:55.872]  Let's go over one of my favorite demons, who I've been fighting for years, Karen Sunlightner.
[01:36:57.052 --> 01:37:01.095]  She's one of the most jack-booted creatures known, one of the county commissioners.
[01:37:01.615 --> 01:37:04.817]  Let's talk about how they get things done, Sal.
[01:37:05.257 --> 01:37:07.539]  Well, I want to talk about the big picture first.
[01:37:08.389 --> 01:37:09.770]  Yeah, let's do that!
[01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:15.754]  That's Rick Williamson, who is on the Texas Transportation Commission, is friends with Perry.
[01:37:15.774 --> 01:37:17.295]  They go back for decades.
[01:37:18.096 --> 01:37:28.203]  And what he did was he said, he told each area, if you don't accept these toll plans we're giving you, then you are going to get no money from us.
[01:37:28.603 --> 01:37:29.424]  That's TxDOT.
[01:37:29.984 --> 01:37:31.065]  They're the head of TxDOT.
[01:37:31.165 --> 01:37:33.747]  So, it's toll roads or no roads.
[01:37:33.907 --> 01:37:34.748]  That's what they told him.
[01:37:34.888 --> 01:37:36.629]  Literally, that's the words he's used.
[01:37:37.347 --> 01:37:42.272]  So, they've threatened the local officials, if they don't do it, they'll get no money.
[01:37:42.592 --> 01:37:52.221]  And the local officials, then they have the local special interests here, which are the real estate folks, the big development folks.
[01:37:53.053 --> 01:37:59.802]  And the lawyers that are working with these special interests, they basically give them money for their campaigns, like Karen Sunlightner.
[01:38:00.803 --> 01:38:08.853]  This past Wednesday she had a up to $2,500 a plate fundraiser by all the special interest folks.
[01:38:10.041 --> 01:38:18.686]  And we had a picket there, and there's a video of it as well, and you can find it at AustinTollParty.com.
[01:38:19.247 --> 01:38:26.351]  And then other elected officials, like Donna Dukes, has a sister, and she works for the CTRMA.
[01:38:27.272 --> 01:38:33.856]  She's worked there since February, and what the American Statesman found out was that she's worked since February, but
[01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:44.988]  The contract wasn't signed for her sister until Donna Dukes voted for the plan, and the contract was signed the morning after the vote.
[01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:49.451]  That's the kind of nonsense that they have going on.
[01:38:49.531 --> 01:38:56.735]  And again, folks, for those who don't understand, $1,800 per family car.
[01:38:56.955 --> 01:38:57.956]  That's just minimum.
[01:38:58.336 --> 01:38:59.397]  That's just in Austin.
[01:39:00.052 --> 01:39:05.576]  With a tracker transponder that follows you and knows exactly where you're going and what you did.
[01:39:06.136 --> 01:39:08.118]  Not to mention all these cameras they put up.
[01:39:08.918 --> 01:39:10.099]  We've paid for these roads.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:18.025]  And then you find out the corporations behind all this have us pay for the roads, then put tolls on it, and the government basically gives it to them.
[01:39:18.185 --> 01:39:19.606]  This is the future of everything.
[01:39:19.626 --> 01:39:20.527]  You want to live in Russia?
[01:39:20.767 --> 01:39:22.008]  You're going to live in it right here.
[01:39:22.448 --> 01:39:26.851]  And all these small towns, folks, that are on these major roads, it's over for you.
[01:39:27.091 --> 01:39:27.932]  And by the way,
[01:39:28.804 --> 01:39:31.105]  I cannot stress that enough.
[01:39:33.585 --> 01:39:35.786]  The problem is, we're going to fight this, we're going to speak out.
[01:39:36.066 --> 01:39:38.866]  They'll cut it by 20% or 30% or something.
[01:39:39.186 --> 01:39:42.187]  We'll still have as many toll roads in Texas as they have nationwide.
[01:39:42.807 --> 01:39:45.408]  They have 7,000 nationwide, this will get to 6,000 nationwide.
[01:39:45.848 --> 01:39:48.008]  But the problem is, this is going in all over the country.
[01:39:48.168 --> 01:39:50.949]  Austin, just in Texas, seems to be on the vanguard of this.
[01:39:50.989 --> 01:39:53.810]  But I've been seeing these plans for years, and they're going ahead with it.
[01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:55.090]  How do we stop them?
[01:39:59.153 --> 01:40:00.455]  Are you asking me?
[01:40:00.675 --> 01:40:00.935]  Yes.
[01:40:01.095 --> 01:40:03.638]  Well, AustinTollParty.com is the way we're going to stop them.
[01:40:04.439 --> 01:40:11.347]  Step one is very important, but hopefully we've got some volunteer lawyers and we're getting ready hopefully to hire
[01:40:12.688 --> 01:40:22.657]  With some sort of a deal from a firm that will put forward a lawsuit that can stop them not only here in Austin but hopefully stop them in other cities.
[01:40:22.797 --> 01:40:30.183]  Now you know when you're dealing with tens of billions of dollars a year in the aggregate and they admit that, you're going to have serious stuff you're facing.
[01:40:30.483 --> 01:40:33.946]  You better watch the law firm because there's a lot of problems with infiltration.
[01:40:34.266 --> 01:40:35.507]  Yeah, well I know that.
[01:40:36.849 --> 01:40:37.850]  Well, that's a good question.
[01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:41.434]  Have you had any of their minions try to infiltrate your organization?
[01:40:42.735 --> 01:40:43.576]  I know of one.
[01:40:45.258 --> 01:40:50.603]  I know of one that sort of got in, but there might be others.
[01:40:50.663 --> 01:40:51.084]  I don't know.
[01:40:51.164 --> 01:40:51.925]  We just don't know.
[01:40:52.691 --> 01:40:55.514]  And what do they do, try to sow dissension, get people in fights?
[01:40:55.814 --> 01:41:02.380]  No, actually this one came in and he was real helpful and he says, hey I know about technology and stuff and I can help you with your data.
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:11.268]  And he got in there and started getting into our data and then we, he actually took some of it and we couldn't get it back.
[01:41:12.209 --> 01:41:13.350]  So we just had that issue.
[01:41:16.298 --> 01:41:18.740]  Oh yeah, you're dealing with a military operation here.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:19.741]  I just hope you know that.
[01:41:20.201 --> 01:41:21.342]  Yeah.
[01:41:21.923 --> 01:41:25.546]  And by military, I mean this is run like a military operation will be run.
[01:41:26.207 --> 01:41:28.068]  I just want people nationwide to know.
[01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:31.051]  I mean, you want your car to be a taxi, you better go along with this.
[01:41:34.093 --> 01:41:34.914]  It's like we're sheep.
[01:41:35.234 --> 01:41:40.619]  It's funny, the most absurd part of this is that they asked us for our feedback.
[01:41:41.337 --> 01:41:45.962]  They gave us a deadline, 93% of us said no, and they said, oh, to heck with you.
[01:41:46.302 --> 01:41:47.103]  We're going to do this anyway.
[01:41:47.143 --> 01:41:51.488]  That's called the Delphi Method, where they claim they want your feedback and act like they're engaging you.
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:42:09.808]  You know, we've seen this over and over again, and describe where you come up with that 93% number, because the 93 and the 98% was in the newspaper, and then they'd have a meeting where 600 people show up, and you know, five people are there for it, and they all work for the toll road companies, but I mean, let's go over some of that, then we'll take some calls.
[01:42:10.108 --> 01:42:16.011]  The feedback was about 6,000 people told them via phone or email
[01:42:18.172 --> 01:42:19.533]  No, do not do this plan.
[01:42:19.593 --> 01:42:22.395]  And less than 600 said yes, do this plan.
[01:42:22.415 --> 01:42:26.317]  And when you look through those folks, because they have it on their website, they're all the special interests.
[01:42:26.417 --> 01:42:28.959]  They're the RECA folks.
[01:42:29.419 --> 01:42:36.783]  It includes the guy that's running a campaign to stop the recall of our mayor, which we are also doing.
[01:42:36.803 --> 01:42:37.744]  We're recalling our mayor.
[01:42:38.758 --> 01:42:41.219]  And that has upset the special interests.
[01:42:41.259 --> 01:42:48.320]  Now for those that don't understand, and this is another neocon mayor we've got, the same guy trying to shut down AXS TV right now, will win.
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:49.720]  Isn't that funny, he will win?
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:51.201]  And he did win.
[01:42:51.221 --> 01:43:02.503]  Now for those that aren't getting the big picture on this, it's very important to understand they just go in and buy up all your politicians and then just cram this down your throat.
[01:43:04.770 --> 01:43:05.871]  That's exactly what's happened.
[01:43:06.332 --> 01:43:09.535]  And we're getting the details on that and we're posting that on our website.
[01:43:11.257 --> 01:43:13.459]  Well, I think we should start toll parties all over the country.
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:14.220]  Yeah.
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:17.383]  Well, Houston Toll Party just started last week.
[01:43:17.423 --> 01:43:18.244]  We started that up.
[01:43:18.685 --> 01:43:19.646]  HoustonTollParty.com.
[01:43:21.966 --> 01:43:23.388]  Well, it's very, very exciting.
[01:43:23.428 --> 01:43:25.190]  Let's talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:43:25.591 --> 01:43:26.572]  Roger, you're on the air.
[01:43:26.632 --> 01:43:27.253]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:43:28.154 --> 01:43:29.957]  Thanks, guys.
[01:43:30.237 --> 01:43:30.938]  Come on, folks.
[01:43:30.958 --> 01:43:35.604]  You're really going to need these polls to finance the expanding socialist gravy.
[01:43:35.644 --> 01:43:36.546]  Release money there, too.
[01:43:37.046 --> 01:43:45.570]  Because otherwise, you know, how are you going to get people's minds being tracked and controlled near as much if you don't preserve the illusion of taking care of them?
[01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:47.671]  Hey, Roger, this is the final phase.
[01:43:48.152 --> 01:43:57.436]  In the early phases worldwide, they socialize things, get people addicted, then they take the socialism away and hand the entire government over to private corporations, but it's not free market.
[01:43:58.617 --> 01:44:00.958]  It's lemon crony capitalism.
[01:44:03.069 --> 01:44:05.210]  Yeah, well, I'll save the other comment for later.
[01:44:05.250 --> 01:44:05.790]  God bless, Jones.
[01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:07.151]  Well, is that it, Roger?
[01:44:07.511 --> 01:44:08.371]  Well, it was a little off.
[01:44:08.411 --> 01:44:13.853]  Well, it was going back to that socialism business with the... You know, you had a caller about five, six days ago.
[01:44:13.873 --> 01:44:15.314]  I think it's the same guy, actually.
[01:44:15.334 --> 01:44:17.075]  He calls different shows.
[01:44:17.575 --> 01:44:27.018]  And it was kind of entertaining because he was sort of agreeing with you about the, you know, the presumably trying to overthrow Castro.
[01:44:27.078 --> 01:44:29.199]  Would that were so in both your and my view.
[01:44:29.679 --> 01:44:31.220]  You know, it was all just a ruse.
[01:44:32.328 --> 01:44:44.220]  And I forget what other dictator is trying to be undermined, but of course, the same guy would of course have to reject that Castro was installed by these same Illuminati.
[01:44:44.801 --> 01:44:46.222]  So this is a guy, I think his name is John.
[01:44:46.242 --> 01:44:48.044]  I hope he calls back and says, yeah, that was me.
[01:44:48.564 --> 01:44:51.988]  Anyway, just a few weeks, a couple months ago actually,
[01:44:52.685 --> 01:45:05.352]  He was on Dave & Joyce, and he was that rare commodity of an open, honest, communist-slash-socialist, all this Karl Marx was, and angles were misunderstood and never implemented, blah-di-blah-di-blah.
[01:45:06.433 --> 01:45:07.553]  Listen, Roger, I hear you.
[01:45:08.314 --> 01:45:11.015]  Let me just make a comment that makes me think of something here.
[01:45:12.756 --> 01:45:15.377]  There's something, a point I want to make, I couldn't remember, and you just brought it up.
[01:45:16.038 --> 01:45:19.760]  You've got the most extreme, ultra-left-wing people that are all against cars,
[01:45:20.487 --> 01:45:20.567]  Yep.
[01:45:39.042 --> 01:45:39.362]  Sorry?
[01:45:39.862 --> 01:45:46.646]  Do you have any comments about how we've got the ultra-super left-wingers who are actually for the plan, along with the big corporations?
[01:45:47.246 --> 01:46:00.053]  Well, it's hard to pin down, you know, politically who's for it here locally, because there are Republicans and Democrats and maverick Republicans and Democrats fighting it.
[01:46:01.194 --> 01:46:04.956]  And everybody that's running, except for the folks that are in power,
[01:46:06.099 --> 01:46:09.443]  They're running whole platforms against this whole plan.
[01:46:10.644 --> 01:46:13.748]  Hopefully they don't get bought out, but that's what happens.
[01:46:15.811 --> 01:46:16.332]  Maybe he'll run.
[01:46:24.386 --> 01:46:29.328]  Actually, I've had hundreds of people tell me they want me to run on a no-toll plan against wind.
[01:46:29.348 --> 01:46:30.188]  There you go.
[01:46:30.208 --> 01:46:32.028]  The problem is the electronic voting machines.
[01:46:32.068 --> 01:46:33.429]  That's a whole other subject.
[01:46:33.929 --> 01:46:36.650]  Those are owned by Clear Channel, which is owned by UT.
[01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:39.751]  You want to find another can of worms, sir?
[01:46:39.791 --> 01:46:41.131]  That rabbit hole goes very deep.
[01:46:41.151 --> 01:46:42.452]  Yeah, sure.
[01:46:42.512 --> 01:46:43.952]  Let's talk to Chris in Texas.
[01:46:43.972 --> 01:46:45.173]  Chris, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:46:45.213 --> 01:46:45.593]  Go ahead.
[01:46:46.333 --> 01:46:46.773]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:47.233 --> 01:46:52.695]  Sal, it's a great speech you guys are having today.
[01:46:53.682 --> 01:47:00.787]  I wanted to interject something real quick, a little bit off the subject, but still with the whole police state thing that's going on.
[01:47:02.608 --> 01:47:11.174]  This past Saturday, I was outside UT, the football game, doing photography work.
[01:47:12.254 --> 01:47:19.179]  And basically, my First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Fifth Amendments were violated by the UT Police.
[01:47:20.727 --> 01:47:23.770]  Because you must be Al-Qaeda if you're videotaping a public event.
[01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:27.633]  Actually, it was still photography.
[01:47:27.793 --> 01:47:28.834]  But I'm being sarcastic.
[01:47:28.854 --> 01:47:33.318]  I mean, all over the country now, they videotape us, but we can't videotape them.
[01:47:33.578 --> 01:47:42.206]  So anyways, there was a complaint made that it was indecent photography, which is completely
[01:47:43.064 --> 01:47:48.009]  Impossible since I was in broad daylight and in front of a crowd of spectators.
[01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.769]  So what do they do?
[01:47:48.829 --> 01:47:50.451]  Threaten to arrest you?
[01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:53.273]  Oh, it gets better.
[01:47:53.353 --> 01:47:59.299]  They come over and one of the officers approaches me and starts questioning me for identification.
[01:47:59.339 --> 01:48:00.940]  I said, you don't need that.
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:01.621]  Fifth Amendment.
[01:48:02.548 --> 01:48:03.908]  And, oh yes we do.
[01:48:04.708 --> 01:48:06.029]  Uh, we need to know who you are.
[01:48:06.729 --> 01:48:10.810]  Well, who's the person that's making this false accusation against me?
[01:48:10.890 --> 01:48:12.390]  I want to know this person.
[01:48:12.530 --> 01:48:13.410]  Thanks to my accuser.
[01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:15.670]  And, oh, well you don't need to know that.
[01:48:15.890 --> 01:48:17.011]  That's none of your business.
[01:48:18.131 --> 01:48:21.651]  And so, it went on for this for a little bit.
[01:48:21.691 --> 01:48:23.372]  Next thing I know, I'm thrown to the ground.
[01:48:23.772 --> 01:48:25.352]  Well, you're resisting arrest.
[01:48:25.852 --> 01:48:26.112]  No.
[01:48:26.152 --> 01:48:27.553]  You refused to give us ID.
[01:48:28.353 --> 01:48:30.033]  Uh, we didn't see your papers, sir.
[01:48:30.964 --> 01:48:39.146]  Uh, so, next thing I know, I'm, uh, you know, arraigned on, uh, two misdemeanor charges, which is all bullcrap.
[01:48:39.801 --> 01:48:40.761]  Because of the... What?
[01:48:41.041 --> 01:48:41.262]  Yeah.
[01:48:41.662 --> 01:48:43.062]  Sir, did they take your film?
[01:48:43.502 --> 01:48:45.143]  They took the camera, everything.
[01:48:45.623 --> 01:48:47.064]  I mean, there's nothing incriminating.
[01:48:49.324 --> 01:48:55.747]  But I mean, as far as the whole instance was instigated because they're trying to trample on your First Amendment rights.
[01:48:56.007 --> 01:48:56.687]  Oh, exactly.
[01:48:56.707 --> 01:48:57.707]  This happens everywhere now.
[01:48:57.767 --> 01:48:58.768]  It's a whole part of the new freedom.
[01:48:58.928 --> 01:48:59.608]  And that's what I'm saying.
[01:48:59.628 --> 01:49:02.489]  Police state right here in Austin at UT.
[01:49:03.249 --> 01:49:07.371]  And, you know, I never felt so violated of my freedoms and liberties
[01:49:07.927 --> 01:49:08.908]  As I did that day.
[01:49:09.008 --> 01:49:18.174]  I mean, I've been, you know, rough areas of neighborhoods, you know, Chicago, New York, whatever, but I was seriously mugged.
[01:49:18.714 --> 01:49:23.217]  And I had my stuff stolen, just as a gang of thugs jumped me.
[01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:26.391]  Uh, I hear the music.
[01:49:26.551 --> 01:49:27.512]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[01:49:27.552 --> 01:49:28.072]  Anything else?
[01:49:28.132 --> 01:49:33.115]  I mean... Uh, yeah, I talked to... I'm going to put you on hold until later, then, because we need to talk a little bit about the toll roads.
[01:49:33.135 --> 01:49:40.059]  I mean, I understand what happened to you was wrong and bad, but I want to take a few calls from people that want to talk about the toll roads, and I'll try to get back to you later.
[01:49:40.619 --> 01:49:41.660]  I'm sorry this happened to you.
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:42.740]  It happens to everybody now.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:43.741]  It's part of the new freedom.
[01:49:44.321 --> 01:49:50.525]  Cameras in our hands are terroristic and evil, and in their hands, they're good, and they're now putting them in school bathrooms and police locker rooms.
[01:49:51.095 --> 01:49:52.597]  Will they videotape us in the bathroom?
[01:49:53.158 --> 01:49:57.484]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.664 --> 01:50:02.110]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.250 --> 01:50:06.657]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.677 --> 01:50:08.038]  The New World Order.
[01:50:08.779 --> 01:50:09.580]  Can emerge.
[01:50:09.801 --> 01:50:14.025]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.085 --> 01:50:21.033]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.153 --> 01:50:23.156]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:33.940]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:39.522]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:53:05.891 --> 01:53:07.572]  But we're talking about the toll roads right now.
[01:53:08.172 --> 01:53:10.172]  Kim and Roy and others want to talk to you, Sal.
[01:53:11.212 --> 01:53:13.493]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kim in Texas.
[01:53:13.533 --> 01:53:14.233]  Kim, you're on the air.
[01:53:14.273 --> 01:53:14.693]  Go ahead.
[01:53:15.514 --> 01:53:16.154]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:16.234 --> 01:53:16.914]  How are you doing today?
[01:53:18.368 --> 01:53:18.648]  Great.
[01:53:19.068 --> 01:53:23.711]  I haven't heard you guys mention an amendment, actually H.R.
[01:53:23.731 --> 01:53:23.711]  1072.
[01:53:24.751 --> 01:53:25.892]  Are you familiar with that?
[01:53:26.972 --> 01:53:29.493]  I've heard of it, but I don't know enough about it.
[01:53:29.513 --> 01:53:30.534]  Do you want to tell us a little about it?
[01:53:31.144 --> 01:53:37.811]  Well, actually, it's an amendment to the Transportation Act that actually put the MPOs into existence.
[01:53:38.832 --> 01:53:47.822]  And basically, it specifically spells out an objective to have tolls from city to city nationwide.
[01:53:48.965 --> 01:53:55.852]  It specifically says in there that it wants each car to have a toll tag and this is supposed to be for environmental reasons.
[01:53:56.352 --> 01:53:59.596]  Well yeah, that's what I got back in 98 with the federal plan.
[01:53:59.916 --> 01:54:01.978]  Why don't you email that to Sal?
[01:54:02.659 --> 01:54:09.646]  I'm going to and the other thing that's in there that's very interesting is apparently right now they cannot toll existing highways.
[01:54:10.615 --> 01:54:15.922]  This bill, or this amendment, would allow them to, you know, toll I-35 if they wanted to.
[01:54:16.042 --> 01:54:26.836]  And to understand what they do, they just go replace a bridge and then turn the whole road into a toll road and say, oh, well this bridge is new, so to go across this hundred yard bridge, you're going to have to pay a toll.
[01:54:27.296 --> 01:54:30.119]  Yeah, but with this, you won't even have to do anything new.
[01:54:30.139 --> 01:54:31.740]  They can put it on existing.
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:32.801]  That's correct.
[01:54:32.821 --> 01:54:36.985]  That's what 3588 allows them to place a toll on anything we've already paid.
[01:54:37.425 --> 01:54:38.566]  Any of our highways, yes.
[01:54:38.946 --> 01:54:40.127]  Right, exactly.
[01:54:40.307 --> 01:54:45.952]  So, I just, and that's HR 1072, and I will go to your site and email that to you.
[01:54:46.052 --> 01:54:47.133]  It's pretty amazing.
[01:54:47.514 --> 01:54:49.716]  And just one other quick thing, Alex, for you.
[01:54:49.736 --> 01:54:54.620]  I saw something real interesting today when I was driving down 35 near William Cannon.
[01:54:55.507 --> 01:55:02.709]  There's a big police van sitting on the side of the road, and it says, now hiring, with a big yellow sign.
[01:55:03.849 --> 01:55:05.709]  And I thought that was the craziest thing I'd ever seen.
[01:55:05.729 --> 01:55:07.130]  Well, as if we need more police.
[01:55:07.210 --> 01:55:09.590]  I mean, literally everywhere, crawling all over us.
[01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:17.752]  Well, and I just heard your caller talk about the photograph, and I went over and took a picture of it, and I have to tell you, I was actually afraid when I was
[01:55:18.533 --> 01:55:19.313]  Over there doing that.
[01:55:19.473 --> 01:55:25.495]  Doing that, and that's just ridiculous that I would feel afraid that I would be getting in trouble for taking a picture of something like that.
[01:55:26.135 --> 01:55:28.396]  But I did feel like I was afraid.
[01:55:28.416 --> 01:55:30.457]  Yeah, we should ask the police.
[01:55:30.677 --> 01:55:33.738]  Why do they show video cameras at Circuit City and Best Buy?
[01:55:34.438 --> 01:55:41.880]  Why, if somebody goes down to UT to, you know, for the football game and is taking pictures, why do you come over and rough them up?
[01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:46.561]  I mean, I was in New York, but I've been all over the country before 9-11 had them turn that camera off.
[01:55:46.862 --> 01:55:48.202]  Well, no, it's my First Amendment.
[01:55:49.243 --> 01:55:53.805]  But now, well, we're going to go ahead and beat you up, because you might be all caught up.
[01:55:55.066 --> 01:55:56.026]  Thanks for the call, Kim.
[01:55:56.046 --> 01:55:56.607]  Great points.
[01:55:56.707 --> 01:56:00.108]  And email that to me as well, that state law.
[01:56:00.408 --> 01:56:01.489]  I've got the federal plan.
[01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:03.570]  Let's talk to Roy in Texas.
[01:56:03.710 --> 01:56:04.550]  Roy, you're on the air.
[01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:05.051]  Go ahead.
[01:56:05.071 --> 01:56:06.031]  Hello.
[01:56:06.111 --> 01:56:09.473]  I'd like to talk about the historical origin of our roads.
[01:56:09.493 --> 01:56:14.655]  Originally, the roadway was deeded for... Defense Department.
[01:56:15.618 --> 01:56:24.064]  Well, also, uh, the local ones and around were deeded for, uh, preserving our physical liberty or our inedible right to travel.
[01:56:25.064 --> 01:56:28.867]  And this looks to me like a 42, uh, suit violation.
[01:56:28.907 --> 01:56:36.412]  Need a class action, uh, against these people for violating their oath of office in a treasonous way and also exceeding their authority.
[01:56:39.014 --> 01:56:39.774]  Well, you're right.
[01:56:39.854 --> 01:56:44.017]  I mean, slaves can't travel and these are checkpoints, folks, not just toll roads.
[01:56:44.457 --> 01:56:45.238]  Uh, comments, Sal?
[01:56:46.445 --> 01:56:50.310]  I think it's, I'm writing it down and when I meet with the lawyers tomorrow night I'll bring it up to them.
[01:56:50.850 --> 01:56:52.973]  Alright, I just wanted to get it out to everybody.
[01:56:53.454 --> 01:56:53.654]  Thank you.
[01:56:53.674 --> 01:56:55.816]  Yeah, well you might need to talk to a different type of lawyer too.
[01:56:55.836 --> 01:56:59.521]  I don't know which group you're talking to, but it could be corporate, it could be... Oh yeah.
[01:56:59.541 --> 01:57:01.263]  And I would agree, this is a civil rights suit.
[01:57:01.723 --> 01:57:01.964]  Yes.
[01:57:04.730 --> 01:57:05.711]  Well, good point, Roy.
[01:57:05.871 --> 01:57:06.712]  Thank you for the call.
[01:57:06.732 --> 01:57:17.201]  We're going to break and do five more minutes with our guest, take a few more calls on the subject of toll roads, which are an integral part of the police state, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:17.302 --> 01:57:28.532]  We want to specifically talk to Sal Castillo, the head of the Austin Toll Party, austintollparty.com.
[01:57:29.275 --> 01:57:29.775]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:29.835 --> 01:57:34.520]  And I'll get to all your other calls and all this other police state news.
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:41.926]  At every level, they're setting up this police state control grid, turning America into the capital of Orwell.
[01:57:43.527 --> 01:57:50.434]  Introducing... Big Brother.
[01:57:51.114 --> 01:57:52.155]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.896 --> 01:57:53.957]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.631 --> 01:57:55.452]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.212 --> 01:57:57.113]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.773 --> 01:58:01.576]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.956 --> 01:58:06.078]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:10.341]  Already into hour number two.
[01:58:10.401 --> 01:58:11.582]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:58:11.662 --> 01:58:16.345]  Janine Roberts, Glitter and Greed, is joining us.
[01:58:16.405 --> 01:58:22.289]  A book that the De Beers and the Oppenheimer family, the controllers of the Diamond Cartel, did not want published.
[01:58:22.893 --> 01:58:30.237]  Veteran investigative author Janine Roberts overcame numerous obstacles and dangers to bring us her findings.
[01:58:30.997 --> 01:58:33.839]  Did you know De Beers hides away rich diamond deposits?
[01:58:34.819 --> 01:58:42.403]  The White House was manipulated into buying millions of diamonds it did not need in order to support an African dictator and now must sell?
[01:58:42.423 --> 01:58:45.145]  Flawless diamonds are made by U.S.
[01:58:45.285 --> 01:58:48.627]  Navy from sewage gas in Washington, D.C.
[01:58:49.207 --> 01:58:51.188]  Litter and greed reveals everything and more
[01:58:52.364 --> 01:58:56.748]  The BBC did not have the guts to broadcast, and the Doubleday was scared to print.
[01:58:57.569 --> 01:59:07.679]  So this is coming up, and with all this news, it's important to know who the global rulers are, and the Oppenheimers are one of the key families over this system.
[01:59:09.882 --> 01:59:16.208]  We've got a bunch of news on the police state, on the New World Order, on Patriot Act 2.5 and the National ID Card.
[01:59:17.173 --> 01:59:19.155]  We haven't even hit the tip of the iceberg, so stay with us.
[01:59:19.175 --> 01:59:23.578]  But right now, let's go to Alex in Florida.
[01:59:23.719 --> 01:59:24.639]  Alex, you're on the air.
[01:59:24.739 --> 01:59:25.220]  Go ahead.
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:26.241]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:26.341 --> 01:59:27.982]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:59:28.262 --> 01:59:28.603]  Welcome.
[01:59:28.883 --> 01:59:29.383]  Thanks.
[01:59:29.603 --> 01:59:29.964]  I'm sorry.
[01:59:30.044 --> 01:59:34.087]  I was at the FDAA meetings back in November.
[01:59:34.107 --> 01:59:38.591]  Free trade area of the Americas, also known as the Pan-American Union.
[01:59:39.071 --> 01:59:40.012]  Correct.
[01:59:40.453 --> 01:59:44.436]  And on the local news, which show these images of the
[01:59:44.901 --> 01:59:59.405]  Of all these riot cops, you know, cracking the skulls of these so-called dangerous anarchists, while the local media would interview the mayor, saying, oh, this is a model for Homeland Security, let's bring this to every single, you know, let's bring this to every single major city when we have events like this, you know, they want to make this the standard.
[01:59:59.505 --> 02:00:01.245]  You know, personally, that scares the heck out of me.
[02:00:01.925 --> 02:00:07.527]  Well, it's training us how not to protest, how not to demonstrate, because they'll hire a few provocateur thugs.
[02:00:08.399 --> 02:00:17.246]  Yeah, I definitely believe that there were some people out there who were hired because their slogans, their shouting and stuff, they just weren't making any sense and they tried to question them.
[02:00:17.266 --> 02:00:22.469]  They'd get mad at you and walk away.
[02:00:22.690 --> 02:00:28.714]  Also, I noticed that the police were pretty much test marketing the Taser guns.
[02:00:29.506 --> 02:00:36.271]  And right after these events, all the local cops on the streets pretty much started having these pager guns now, and what they are, they're guns.
[02:00:36.351 --> 02:00:42.696]  Well, that's a non-lethal weapon, or sometimes kills you, that trains them to go ahead and engage you or attack you.
[02:00:42.716 --> 02:00:49.241]  It's a training aid, like you train a puppy German Shepherd attack dog on dummies first.
[02:00:49.622 --> 02:00:55.226]  This is just training the news and then the public to accept the public being shot at for no reason.
[02:00:56.105 --> 02:01:00.167]  Right, and they're much more liberal with the use of these because they're so-called non-lethal.
[02:01:00.287 --> 02:01:02.028]  Well, you know, it's like the pepper spray now.
[02:01:02.108 --> 02:01:04.970]  Now you talk back or ask a question, they spray it in your face.
[02:01:06.131 --> 02:01:09.593]  I was also at the Miami Arena during the debate.
[02:01:09.753 --> 02:01:18.097]  They were having a debate rally there for John Kerry where we'd watch the debates on the Miami Arena floor, which was very appropriate considering that's where the WWF has their event.
[02:01:18.898 --> 02:01:19.238]  Yes.
[02:01:20.234 --> 02:01:41.110]  And after Kerry was done giving the speech over at U.M., he went over to the Miami Arena to give a speech where he didn't really say much, but he was really good at rallying the crowd, and people were chanting, Kerry, Kerry, and no one was really like... No one had realized, he just said Iran had nuclear weapons, and he named out countries on the project.
[02:01:41.170 --> 02:01:45.554]  Yeah, nobody understood that he was like, I want a bigger military to attack more countries!
[02:01:45.614 --> 02:01:46.194]  Right, right.
[02:01:46.214 --> 02:01:47.115]  Oh, how liberal!
[02:01:48.298 --> 02:01:57.427]  Yeah, and when I bring up Skull and Bones to the people standing around me, the usual response I get is, like, oh, that's just a frat, or, you know, there's a bunch of kids, there's no conspiracy in that.
[02:01:57.447 --> 02:02:01.612]  And five years ago it didn't exist, but now, oh, it's just some fun.
[02:02:02.032 --> 02:02:02.252]  Yeah.
[02:02:02.973 --> 02:02:10.321]  And, you know, at the end of the event, you know, everyone felt like they made a difference, and they go home, and at the end of the day they're still voting for whoever Diebold will allow them to.
[02:02:10.765 --> 02:02:11.825]  Because of the touchscreen voting system.
[02:02:12.125 --> 02:02:12.646]  Exactly.
[02:02:12.686 --> 02:02:14.626]  It's all making us feel like we're part of it.
[02:02:15.106 --> 02:02:16.887]  That's what the gladiatorial events were about.
[02:02:16.907 --> 02:02:32.152]  We're making you feel like you had power within the state and you got to put thumbs up or thumbs down whether to, you know, kill somebody and, you know, now it's just another extrapolation of that where we all go have these mock elections where the candidates are already selected.
[02:02:32.432 --> 02:02:33.313]  Great call, Alex.
[02:02:33.353 --> 02:02:34.453]  Hope you'll call back sometime.
[02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:36.709]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:02:36.729 --> 02:02:40.691]  We'll come to our guests when we get back and then go to more of your calls and a ton of news.
[02:02:41.091 --> 02:02:44.672]  PresidentPlanet.tv, please stay with us.

[02:04:44.446 --> 02:04:51.273]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:04:51.593 --> 02:04:52.975]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:04:53.175 --> 02:04:55.397]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:04:55.517 --> 02:04:57.619]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:02.824]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:05:03.165 --> 02:05:07.209]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:19.955]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:05:20.095 --> 02:05:21.996]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:05:46.509 --> 02:05:52.533]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.153 --> 02:05:56.195]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.458 --> 02:06:03.079]  When I was
[02:06:03.991 --> 02:06:07.694]  A little boy, I had family who were in the diamond business.
[02:06:08.815 --> 02:06:15.601]  They did currying work for diamonds that were coming into the country out of Africa, selling them.
[02:06:15.941 --> 02:06:17.742]  I remember seeing my dad on the news.
[02:06:17.842 --> 02:06:19.384]  He was just a low-level functionary.
[02:06:19.824 --> 02:06:24.408]  When they brought some giant South African diamond to Dallas, they had the guys with the shotguns guarding it.
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:29.984]  And my dad told me, he said, they've got, you know, over in Europe just huge bins of diamonds.
[02:06:30.424 --> 02:06:34.567]  Diamonds are actually extremely common and they're almost semi-precious.
[02:06:35.348 --> 02:06:36.488]  They're not really precious.
[02:06:37.569 --> 02:06:40.251]  And we're talking about, you know, naturally formed diamonds.
[02:06:40.311 --> 02:06:44.254]  And he talked about the Oppenheimer family and how it was all a staged deal.
[02:06:45.655 --> 02:06:49.578]  And then they had a PBS documentary a few years ago where they admitted it was all a big monopoly.
[02:06:49.638 --> 02:06:53.321]  And then there was an article in the New Yorker magazine
[02:06:55.080 --> 02:07:18.247]  I guess three or four years ago that I read on air where they just bragged that, well, the Oppenheimers run the De Beers cartel and they send in mercenary troops and helicopters and tanks and slaughter people who try to dig diamonds up with themselves and sell them because even a small trickle of diamonds, quote, conflict diamonds, evil terrorist diamonds, destabilizes their monopoly.
[02:07:19.816 --> 02:07:24.257]  And so they just, and they bragged in the article, we're going to label people that sell diamonds as terrorists.
[02:07:24.357 --> 02:07:25.017]  This was before 9-11.
[02:07:25.037 --> 02:07:28.338]  So I guess it was over four years ago.
[02:07:28.398 --> 02:07:29.338]  Time really flies.
[02:07:30.058 --> 02:07:32.859]  And our guest joins us from England via cell phone.
[02:07:32.879 --> 02:07:35.179]  We're going to try to get with a landline with her in the next segment.
[02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:46.982]  A major monopoly expose and work on corporate ethics, Glitter and Greed is a book that De Beers and the Oppenheimer family, the controllers of the diamond cartel, do not want published.
[02:07:47.771 --> 02:07:50.152]  And we're going to go over that with Janine Roberts.
[02:07:51.353 --> 02:07:54.415]  And it's great to have you on the broadcast with us.
[02:07:55.475 --> 02:07:56.376]  Hi, it's good to be here.
[02:07:56.996 --> 02:07:57.436]  You bet.
[02:07:57.776 --> 02:08:08.622]  Just give us a thumbnail sketch for those who don't understand how the Oppenheimers got their monopoly, how the cartel works, what's really going on, and what your book covers.
[02:08:09.983 --> 02:08:13.385]  Well, when diamonds were found in South Africa 100 years ago,
[02:08:15.231 --> 02:08:24.534]  The rich merchants of Europe panicked because they had all these really expensive diamonds they got from India and diamonds were literally found sparkling in the moonlight.
[02:08:25.494 --> 02:08:42.038]  They had African captives crawl over the sand picking up diamonds by moonlight with tin cans strung around their necks and drop the diamonds in the tin cans and they had gags on their mouth to make sure they wouldn't swallow any diamonds and sort of steal them that way.
[02:08:43.354 --> 02:08:45.816]  Well, now they x-ray them after work.
[02:08:46.437 --> 02:08:47.818]  They x-ray them after work.
[02:08:48.038 --> 02:08:56.405]  In fact, I found out that some people give whole body x-rays every day at the Diamond Mines, which is very hazardous to health.
[02:08:56.926 --> 02:09:04.112]  And an operative that actually had done this for De Beers told me that he couldn't report this.
[02:09:04.172 --> 02:09:11.518]  He had to hide the records of what they were doing, because obviously they're endangering the health of that miner by x-raying them every day.
[02:09:13.246 --> 02:09:14.727]  So it wasn't recorded that he was doing that.
[02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:20.531]  They don't, you know, they don't have people calling by moonlight anymore.
[02:09:21.371 --> 02:09:23.693]  But I got smuggled inside the diamond mines.
[02:09:23.753 --> 02:09:28.216]  I've been inside De Beers diamond mines, you know, the giant mines of Southern Africa and Namibia.
[02:09:29.877 --> 02:09:34.780]  And I found, like, all the families, their wives and kids, waiting outside the mining town.
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:37.062]  Now this is a mining town run by De Beers.
[02:09:37.102 --> 02:09:41.825]  It's got a church, it's a regular town, it's got schools, stores, a lot.
[02:09:43.103 --> 02:09:44.344]  But the families weren't allowed in.
[02:09:44.785 --> 02:09:46.586]  The wives and kids weren't allowed into the town.
[02:09:46.626 --> 02:09:49.069]  Now all the white miners have got their wives and kids with them.
[02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:51.912]  So I said, you know, how come you can't bring your wives in?
[02:09:51.992 --> 02:09:53.333]  And they said, oh no, it's a rule.
[02:09:54.454 --> 02:10:00.900]  If you're a wage band A and B, that's the lowest paid, then you have to stay in single men's quarters.
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:06.786]  So I asked, what happens if your wife gets a job in the mining town, say as a cleaner or a cook?
[02:10:08.078 --> 02:10:12.701]  No, she has to then stay in single women's quarters and sign up on the wall.
[02:10:12.901 --> 02:10:16.923]  If you're caught sleeping with your husband, then you can be banished from the town.
[02:10:17.864 --> 02:10:33.853]  So basically it's still slavery going on, and I've seen the video deep inside these giant dangerous mines, but I want to get into the history of who the Oppenheimers are, how they got this monopoly, and then how they have literally these warehouses full of diamonds.
[02:10:34.873 --> 02:10:36.114]  Okay, well it started
[02:10:36.644 --> 02:10:51.350]  The bloke called Cecil Rhodes, British colonial servant, went out there, saw these diamonds coming out of the ground, got in touch with the investors in Europe and said, look, you're right about the price of your investments.
[02:10:52.011 --> 02:11:06.137]  If you fund me, I'll buy up control in Southern Africa with your money, buy up all the diamond mining leases, on the proprietor that I'll sell the diamonds only to a cartel that you set up.
[02:11:07.344 --> 02:11:09.185]  And that was the origin for the De Beers Company.
[02:11:09.505 --> 02:11:11.947]  It was actually set up to keep diamonds rare.
[02:11:13.067 --> 02:11:14.868]  Not to produce them, but to keep them rare.
[02:11:16.169 --> 02:11:27.756]  Later on, just the year he died, a family working a diamond company in this cartel in Europe, the Oppenheimer family, moved out to Southern Africa, and they came to take this over.
[02:11:28.016 --> 02:11:35.660]  They first got control over the German mines at the end of the First World War, the mines in what was South West Africa,
[02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:39.021]  They used that to break De Beers.
[02:11:39.061 --> 02:11:44.984]  They said, look, we've got diamonds and we're going to compete against you unless you make our guy chairman of De Beers.
[02:11:46.124 --> 02:11:48.885]  And that's how the Oppenheimers took over the company.
[02:11:49.486 --> 02:11:52.467]  Okay, now, do me a favor... ...controlled by just one family.
[02:11:53.067 --> 02:11:55.008]  The Chester England family, by the way.
[02:11:55.028 --> 02:11:57.650]  It's not a Jewish family, just in case people are mistaken.
[02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:59.851]  Um, I don't think I said that.
[02:12:00.391 --> 02:12:01.872]  Uh... No, no, it's alright.
[02:12:01.972 --> 02:12:04.393]  People are going to say things... It's not... It's, um...
[02:12:06.978 --> 02:12:09.178]  Yeah.
[02:12:09.939 --> 02:12:11.959]  I thought Oppenheimer was either Dutch or German.
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:15.321]  Yeah.
[02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:17.822]  But I know they married him with some Dutch as well.
[02:12:17.862 --> 02:12:18.942]  These families all in her breed.
[02:12:19.882 --> 02:12:20.582]  Just do me a favor.
[02:12:20.622 --> 02:12:21.663]  It's your cell phone.
[02:12:21.703 --> 02:12:22.643]  It's overdriving.
[02:12:23.023 --> 02:12:24.004]  And it distorts.
[02:12:24.044 --> 02:12:25.124]  So be sure and back off that.
[02:12:25.164 --> 02:12:25.824]  I apologize.
[02:12:25.844 --> 02:12:27.505]  Just be sure and don't overdrive.
[02:12:28.218 --> 02:12:28.979]  Is that any better?
[02:12:29.359 --> 02:12:30.300]  That's a lot better, yes.
[02:12:30.801 --> 02:12:31.141]  Okay.
[02:12:31.301 --> 02:12:31.822]  I apologize.
[02:12:31.842 --> 02:12:32.683]  Just try to keep it right there.
[02:12:32.703 --> 02:12:33.023]  That's okay.
[02:12:33.063 --> 02:12:34.545]  It's got a loudspeaker on it and an earphone.
[02:12:34.565 --> 02:12:35.666]  I'll just move it further away.
[02:12:36.026 --> 02:12:36.326]  Okay.
[02:12:37.047 --> 02:12:37.487]  Yeah.
[02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:43.714]  It's... We'll fix the phone problem during the next... Just a little tip.
[02:12:43.754 --> 02:12:48.879]  You don't want to do interviews with one of those headpieces because they always overdrive and distort.
[02:12:49.714 --> 02:12:53.478]  We'll try to get you on a landline here during the break, but enough on that subject there.
[02:12:53.818 --> 02:12:54.719]  Is that any better now?
[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:56.101]  Yeah, that's a lot better.
[02:12:56.561 --> 02:12:57.943]  I have done quite a few on this.
[02:12:58.403 --> 02:12:59.144]  Okay, well, fine.
[02:12:59.184 --> 02:13:00.045]  It can get working.
[02:13:00.165 --> 02:13:01.886]  Okay, well, I mean, I just, I do radio.
[02:13:01.906 --> 02:13:05.030]  This is what I do, and believe me, it's distorting.
[02:13:05.110 --> 02:13:06.411]  I just want to be able to hear what you're saying.
[02:13:07.032 --> 02:13:07.312]  Yeah.
[02:13:07.472 --> 02:13:09.634]  But, again, I don't want to spend all day on that.
[02:13:10.235 --> 02:13:10.415]  Okay.
[02:13:12.043 --> 02:13:18.987]  Again, everything you're saying is accurate from the history I researched, but as you said, you've written a book about this, you've been in the mines, you've interviewed people inside this system.
[02:13:19.508 --> 02:13:36.459]  How valuable would diamonds really be if there wasn't this global cartel, and if you could get diamonds out of Canada, diamonds out of South America, if you could get diamonds out of Arkansas, if you could get diamonds out of all of Africa.
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:44.102]  If it was just free market, and it wasn't a monopoly, how much would diamonds really be worth?
[02:13:44.122 --> 02:13:47.164]  In all regards, it would be less than $5 a diamond.
[02:13:49.925 --> 02:13:59.750]  The cost of production, I found, was around, in South Africa, it's around $7 a carat, of carat weight of diamonds.
[02:14:00.970 --> 02:14:06.913]  And they're cut, today, diamonds are cut for 25 cents each, by kicking
[02:14:07.606 --> 02:14:07.946]  India.
[02:14:08.146 --> 02:14:09.067]  Young people in India.
[02:14:10.888 --> 02:14:12.248]  So the cost is minute.
[02:14:12.328 --> 02:14:16.530]  So rubies, emeralds, other gems are much rarer than diamonds.
[02:14:18.031 --> 02:14:18.691]  Just as you said.
[02:14:19.352 --> 02:14:22.953]  Now for those who don't understand this, again I've had family who's been in this business.
[02:14:23.233 --> 02:14:25.975]  My dad ran out of college for a few years.
[02:14:26.095 --> 02:14:30.497]  Worked for a French family out of South Africa.
[02:14:31.317 --> 02:14:32.658]  Have you ever heard of the Bull Brothers?
[02:14:33.618 --> 02:14:34.459]  I have indeed.
[02:14:34.839 --> 02:14:35.059]  Yeah.
[02:14:35.814 --> 02:14:41.956]  And so, that's how I have the inside scoop on this, and most people just aren't even aware of it, even though it's an open secret.
[02:14:43.236 --> 02:14:56.180]  I mean, diamonds basically grow on trees, folks, but I know people who mortgage their house or go into debt to buy that $5,000, $10,000 diamond ring for a marriage, and it's a complete fraud.
[02:14:56.580 --> 02:15:00.801]  As you said, $5 a carat and a couple dollars to cut them, or even less.
[02:15:00.821 --> 02:15:03.061]  25 cents to cut them.
[02:15:07.062 --> 02:15:08.523]  And people aren't going to stop though.
[02:15:09.564 --> 02:15:18.729]  In your book you also get into how, we're not talking about Zirconians, we're talking about real diamonds that the military has a patent on creating as well.
[02:15:19.810 --> 02:15:24.873]  Yeah, I filmed a woman working for the military in Washington D.C.
[02:15:26.194 --> 02:15:36.160]  She was in the Air Force and she was growing a diamond just using an oxy-acetylene torch and gas from next door sewage works.
[02:15:36.610 --> 02:15:37.751]  And it's a big joke.
[02:15:38.771 --> 02:15:47.497]  They just inject some gas from sewage works into the flame of the torch and a diamond, a real diamond, crystallizes out.
[02:15:48.778 --> 02:15:54.702]  And that technique now has now been picked up by a couple of companies, one in Florida, the other up in Massachusetts.
[02:15:55.382 --> 02:15:56.783]  And they're using the same technique.
[02:15:56.803 --> 02:15:57.984]  But it's been around a long time.
[02:15:58.444 --> 02:16:02.627]  And I found that De Beers has in fact been using this technique to grow diamonds.
[02:16:03.536 --> 02:16:08.902]  It's got a plant that does it in England, in the Isle of Man, and it's got another plant in South Africa.
[02:16:08.922 --> 02:16:15.649]  So they've been keeping real quiet about this, but these are Florida Stymons, the one in the million that they're growing.
[02:16:17.351 --> 02:16:17.991]  Amazing!
[02:16:18.091 --> 02:16:18.312]  So...
[02:16:19.491 --> 02:16:20.692]  There's so much I want to talk about.
[02:16:20.732 --> 02:16:24.895]  We're so honored to have you on the broadcast with us.
[02:16:25.216 --> 02:16:26.957]  I mean, there's so many facets to this.
[02:16:27.397 --> 02:16:32.882]  I want to get into what the, how the Oppenheimers tried to stop you from publishing your book.
[02:16:32.902 --> 02:16:40.328]  And then I also want to get into how they admittedly go in with mercenary forces and take over countries that refuse to be part of their cartel.
[02:16:41.689 --> 02:16:42.009]  Okay.
[02:16:43.590 --> 02:16:47.073]  Just before we break, how did they try to stop you from publishing your book?
[02:16:49.088 --> 02:17:18.117]  I can't be 100% sure, but you know, I made that film that was on PBS Network, the Diamond Empire film, and right during that, Mr. Oppenheimer himself, the current chairman, intervened with the BBC and put me under a lot of pressure with the BBC, and then when I got Doubleday to contract to do the book, and they gave me a round-the-world book contract, told me that the manuscript was sensational and accomplished, and then just three months
[02:17:18.695 --> 02:17:28.679]  Before the book was due to print, after they'd advertised it, after two major newspapers had lined up to serialize it, they suddenly cancelled.
[02:17:29.399 --> 02:17:39.163]  And the letter they'd sent me said that rich and important businessmen did not want the book to come out, and as though we might win any legal action.
[02:17:39.443 --> 02:17:40.323]  Okay, we've got a break.
[02:17:40.363 --> 02:17:42.204]  We'll be right back with our incredible guest.
[02:17:42.224 --> 02:17:42.704]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.778 --> 02:17:48.559]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:52.482]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:17:52.982 --> 02:17:53.643]  Let's update.
[02:17:54.163 --> 02:17:57.625]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:17:58.286 --> 02:18:02.008]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:18:02.689 --> 02:18:03.630]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:18:03.670 --> 02:18:05.991]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[02:18:06.511 --> 02:18:07.412]  Today, the U.S.
[02:18:07.432 --> 02:18:09.674]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[02:18:10.054 --> 02:18:11.555]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:18:12.148 --> 02:18:14.129]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[02:18:15.489 --> 02:18:20.351]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:18:21.331 --> 02:18:23.512]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[02:18:23.912 --> 02:18:26.453]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:18:27.091 --> 02:18:28.472]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:18:28.912 --> 02:18:30.614]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:18:31.034 --> 02:18:33.016]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:18:33.416 --> 02:18:35.517]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:18:37.699 --> 02:18:39.861]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[02:18:40.221 --> 02:18:40.541]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:46.602]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:18:46.782 --> 02:18:47.944]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:18:48.104 --> 02:18:51.529]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:18:51.629 --> 02:18:52.049]  Phenol!
[02:18:52.370 --> 02:18:59.459]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:03.864]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:19:04.004 --> 02:19:04.425]  Fragrance?
[02:19:04.805 --> 02:19:09.570]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:19:09.710 --> 02:19:14.395]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[02:19:14.635 --> 02:19:17.118]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calvin shampoo.
[02:19:17.438 --> 02:19:20.841]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:19:21.001 --> 02:19:24.544]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:19:24.745 --> 02:19:27.527]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:19:27.547 --> 02:19:30.129]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:19:55.359 --> 02:20:06.603]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:20:06.923 --> 02:20:12.065]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[02:20:12.125 --> 02:20:12.665]  No problem.
[02:20:12.885 --> 02:20:19.547]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:19.767 --> 02:20:26.570]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:20:26.850 --> 02:20:28.610]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.

[02:21:16.886 --> 02:21:17.666]  Which are collectible?

[02:21:46.112 --> 02:21:48.873]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:21:49.133 --> 02:21:52.793]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:54.774 --> 02:21:55.674]  All right, my friends.
[02:21:55.734 --> 02:22:15.218]  Jeanine Roberts shot her documentary, which I've seen and is amazing, in six continents, and it aired on PBS, got censored over in England, and I have been inside and seen the inside, just locally, of the diamond business, and believe me, this is what's going on.
[02:22:15.874 --> 02:22:20.920]  And it's a great example of how what we think is the truth is really the complete opposite of the truth.
[02:22:21.100 --> 02:22:21.560]  Diamonds.
[02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:26.105]  Warehouses full of just giant crates of diamonds.
[02:22:26.145 --> 02:22:27.246]  They've been hoarding them.
[02:22:27.547 --> 02:22:29.789]  Their business isn't selling you diamonds.
[02:22:30.170 --> 02:22:37.738]  Their business is controlling and monopolizing them because, again, five to six dollars a carat, just a few cents to cut them.
[02:22:39.176 --> 02:22:47.775]  And meanwhile you're spending five, six, ten thousand dollars because you've got to get your wife that big two-carat diamond for that wedding or for that anniversary.
[02:22:49.324 --> 02:22:52.966]  And just an amazing documentary she made, and of course she wrote the book Glitter and Greed.
[02:22:53.286 --> 02:22:54.426]  And why is she on a cell phone?
[02:22:54.446 --> 02:23:01.609]  She's on her boat, her 45 foot boat, off of the coast of England via cell phone, and it's great to have her, Janine Roberts.
[02:23:02.169 --> 02:23:17.136]  Janine, let's get back into the TV documentary that you did, that I'm sure a lot of our listeners saw, and then get into how, according to New Yorker Magazine, De Beers hires mercenaries to go into countries and literally invade diamond mines that are unauthorized.
[02:23:17.156 --> 02:23:17.656]  Tell us about it.
[02:23:18.593 --> 02:23:21.295]  Yeah, we actually found one and interviewed him for the film.
[02:23:22.996 --> 02:23:29.882]  The guy was employed, in his own testimony, so it's, you know, alleged, but he said this is what he did, and he was well known for it.
[02:23:30.702 --> 02:23:42.491]  He'd been in West Africa for De Beers, intercepting, with his mercenaries, groups of Africans out trying to trade diamonds, independently, outside the cartel.
[02:23:43.974 --> 02:23:48.524]  And he said he captured people, held them in prison, and that he tortured people.
[02:23:49.927 --> 02:23:52.392]  And he said he was employed to do this by the beers.
[02:23:52.953 --> 02:23:55.218]  His own words, we didn't have a contract to see.
[02:23:56.212 --> 02:23:58.693]  But it was a notorious case.
[02:23:59.093 --> 02:24:12.480]  Well, did you see the big cover story, I guess, four years ago in New Yorker, where they bragged about it and how they were going to have the US military invade the African coast to stop these, quote, conflict diamonds?
[02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:14.461]  I mean, that was admitted a few years ago.
[02:24:14.481 --> 02:24:18.903]  Oh, you know, this conflict diamonds thing, we really should have it made fair.
[02:24:19.663 --> 02:24:24.786]  At the moment, it's only diamonds produced by rebels that go under conflict diamonds.
[02:24:25.555 --> 02:24:35.097]  And Amnesty International has just pointed out there's a big mine in the Congo and there are literally bodies floating down the river past the gates of the mine.
[02:24:35.377 --> 02:24:38.218]  Bodies of people murdered by the staff of the mine.
[02:24:39.118 --> 02:24:41.199]  And they said, well, these weren't conflict diamonds.
[02:24:41.379 --> 02:24:50.281]  They're sold as conflict-free diamonds to America because the mine is run by the Congo government with the help of De Beers.
[02:24:50.341 --> 02:24:52.081]  De Beers has got a corporate interest in it.
[02:24:52.601 --> 02:24:55.102]  But that meant there weren't conflicts because they weren't run by rebels.
[02:24:56.388 --> 02:25:04.170]  We need to look again at this conflict diamond business and say all mines should follow one code of ethics.
[02:25:04.990 --> 02:25:09.271]  Well, let's go over your incredible documentary film.
[02:25:09.311 --> 02:25:10.031]  Tell us about that.
[02:25:11.431 --> 02:25:12.591]  Oh, that was hair-raising.
[02:25:13.472 --> 02:25:20.153]  I had to raise over a million dollars to make it and my previous film had been pretty low budget, made with aborigines in the outback.
[02:25:25.195 --> 02:25:26.556]  The beers tried to do everything.
[02:25:28.037 --> 02:25:31.358]  We got banned from Diamond Mines and then we got inside them.
[02:25:32.179 --> 02:25:41.663]  When we got to New York with our film crew, we found that most of the diamond merchants down on Fifth Avenue had had phone calls telling them not to talk to us.
[02:25:43.584 --> 02:25:50.528]  But eventually I met this lovely gentleman, Mr. Goldberg, Liam Goldberg,
[02:25:51.434 --> 02:25:59.318]  He runs a very large, he ran, he died recently unfortunately, but he runs a big diamond practice where he cuts diamonds the size of pigeon eggs.
[02:26:00.899 --> 02:26:01.639]  On 5th Avenue.
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:12.385]  And, uh, he, I said, um, he said, I turned up with my film crew, and he said, I think I'm the wrong man for you.
[02:26:12.405 --> 02:26:17.688]  Well, I was a bit horrified, I really depended on getting this guy on camera.
[02:26:19.149 --> 02:26:19.549]  And, uh,
[02:26:21.024 --> 02:26:22.685]  So I said, did you get a phone call?
[02:26:22.845 --> 02:26:24.405]  He said, yes, I did get a phone call.
[02:26:25.686 --> 02:26:32.109]  I was told that you worked with blacks in Australia and helped them fight diamond mines.
[02:26:32.129 --> 02:26:35.670]  And all I could say was, guilty as charged.
[02:26:36.030 --> 02:26:37.611]  I had worked with blacks in Australia.
[02:26:38.751 --> 02:26:47.835]  Then we had a big talk about that and I said, look, Jewish people have got sacred places in Israel and Aboriginal people have got sacred bits of land in Australia.
[02:26:48.559 --> 02:26:54.981]  It's all much the same, you know, it's land that people think of as sacred and they didn't want others to trespass on them and destroy it.
[02:26:55.001 --> 02:27:02.323]  Because in Australia they found the world's, what's now the world's biggest diamond mine on top of a place that was sacred to women.
[02:27:02.343 --> 02:27:11.225]  It was a place that women have been going to, to pray for thousands of years, up in the northwest of Australia, on top of a mountain range.
[02:27:12.046 --> 02:27:12.986]  Very sacred place.
[02:27:14.201 --> 02:27:19.665]  And now that place is totally destroyed today, over the opposition of the aboriginal people.
[02:27:20.465 --> 02:27:26.870]  And today it's an enormous pit, producing some 7 tons of diamonds every year.
[02:27:28.010 --> 02:27:30.932]  We'll be right back with our guests, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:30.952 --> 02:27:33.314]  You're getting ripped off of these diamonds.
[02:27:33.334 --> 02:27:33.774]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.575 --> 02:27:36.516]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.976 --> 02:27:38.597]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.617 --> 02:27:42.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.569 --> 02:27:53.835]  You've heard about Paws from BioLox International and its Bubble Up technology, but have you heard about BioLox Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up technology?
[02:27:54.055 --> 02:28:01.000]  BioLox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[02:28:01.380 --> 02:28:08.045]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[02:28:08.346 --> 02:28:11.828]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioWox Citrus Concentrate.
[02:28:11.968 --> 02:28:12.949]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioWox.com.
[02:28:16.932 --> 02:28:24.079]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason Bio-Ox International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[02:28:24.159 --> 02:28:30.865]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[02:28:31.065 --> 02:28:35.749]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[02:28:35.929 --> 02:28:38.472]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[02:28:38.612 --> 02:28:43.276]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use the Bio-Ox family of products.
[02:28:45.077 --> 02:28:48.098]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:48.398 --> 02:28:53.339]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:53.599 --> 02:28:57.940]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.241 --> 02:29:07.143]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.363 --> 02:29:10.984]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.264 --> 02:29:16.312]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:16.592 --> 02:29:23.342]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:23.823 --> 02:29:24.203]  What about you?
[02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:30.463]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:29:47.074 --> 02:29:52.539]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:52.980 --> 02:29:57.224]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:57.444 --> 02:30:04.491]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:04.871 --> 02:30:10.977]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:10.997 --> 02:30:12.338]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:12.658 --> 02:30:15.622]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:15.762 --> 02:30:17.744]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:18.105 --> 02:30:25.353]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:25.634 --> 02:30:29.018]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:30:29.438 --> 02:30:32.541]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:30:32.561 --> 02:30:32.601]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:32.621 --> 02:30:32.901]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:32.941 --> 02:30:33.882]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.902 --> 02:30:34.142]  Call today.
[02:30:34.202 --> 02:30:35.644]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:35.664 --> 02:30:37.405]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:57.572 --> 02:31:04.355]  Veteran investigative author Janine Roberts overcame numerous obstacles and dangers to bring us her findings.
[02:31:04.395 --> 02:31:13.099]  She went to six continents and made the most incredible film I've ever seen, exposing monopolies concerning the diamond trade.
[02:31:13.939 --> 02:31:15.940]  She's got the book, Glitter and Greed,
[02:31:16.795 --> 02:31:18.877]  And we have a bookstore on Infowars.com.
[02:31:18.897 --> 02:31:23.102]  I ought to get a hold of her publisher and carry this because this is such an illustration.
[02:31:23.142 --> 02:31:24.483]  And it's the same thing with the oil.
[02:31:24.904 --> 02:31:26.325]  It's the same thing now with water.
[02:31:26.726 --> 02:31:35.916]  These same institutions and families are monopolizing key parts of the economy and running massive scams.
[02:31:35.956 --> 02:31:37.638]  They create artificial scarcity.
[02:31:38.058 --> 02:31:44.500]  We'll be talking to her in just a few minutes, and then if you want to talk to her yourselves, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:45.540]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:46.381 --> 02:31:53.983]  She's joining us from her own boat off the coast of England out there via cell phone.
[02:31:54.743 --> 02:31:55.443]  We're honored to have her.
[02:31:55.683 --> 02:31:58.004]  We'll get back to her here in just one moment.
[02:31:58.624 --> 02:31:59.384]  But think about that.
[02:31:59.444 --> 02:32:00.945]  Giant warehouses full of diamonds.
[02:32:02.205 --> 02:32:03.166]  A world monopoly.
[02:32:03.846 --> 02:32:04.466]  Mercenaries.
[02:32:04.526 --> 02:32:07.667]  Troops slaughtering those that dare try to dig them out of the ground themselves.
[02:32:08.624 --> 02:32:13.287]  That's why diamond prices went down a few years ago is because there were some people leaking out just a small quantity of them.
[02:32:13.607 --> 02:32:15.289]  We'll go back to her here in just a few minutes.
[02:32:15.729 --> 02:32:21.092]  With all the uncertainty and all the talk of terror attacks and all the rest of this, shouldn't you have an insurance policy?
[02:32:21.633 --> 02:32:27.076]  Ready Reserve Foods has gained the reputation of providing virtually the finest dehydrated, storable foods available.
[02:32:27.397 --> 02:32:32.560]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in the United States.
[02:32:32.940 --> 02:32:38.124]  Food units need no refrigeration because they're nitrogen-packed, which vastly extends their shelf life.
[02:32:38.625 --> 02:32:41.542]  Folks, I got a year food supply.
[02:32:42.546 --> 02:32:43.606]  For two people from them.
[02:32:44.087 --> 02:32:45.487]  And I am so happy with it.
[02:32:45.527 --> 02:32:46.988]  It'll store for a decade.
[02:32:47.008 --> 02:32:48.808]  And I've bought storable food before.
[02:32:48.848 --> 02:32:50.249]  It's an insurance policy you can eat.
[02:32:50.669 --> 02:32:52.110]  It's just something I have for my family.
[02:32:52.350 --> 02:32:55.231]  Let me tell you, this is the highest quality I've ever seen, folks.
[02:32:55.611 --> 02:32:56.751]  I am blown away by them.
[02:32:56.971 --> 02:32:58.432]  They've got a new special.
[02:32:58.912 --> 02:33:02.513]  Normally, a one-year food supply is $14.95 plus shipping.
[02:33:02.633 --> 02:33:03.154]  It's now only $12.95.
[02:33:03.194 --> 02:33:03.154]  $1,295.
[02:33:03.374 --> 02:33:04.634]  And the shipping is free.
[02:33:10.137 --> 02:33:11.538]  The shipping's like 300 bucks.
[02:33:12.479 --> 02:33:16.541]  So, you need to take advantage of this now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:16.982 --> 02:33:18.923]  I ordered it and got it in about a week and a half.
[02:33:19.483 --> 02:33:20.824]  Just amazing quality.
[02:33:21.004 --> 02:33:22.826]  All grown right here in the United States.
[02:33:23.386 --> 02:33:25.147]  All from here in the United States.
[02:33:25.948 --> 02:33:29.010]  You need to give Ready Reserve Foods a call right now.
[02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.570]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:33:29.590 --> 02:33:29.690]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:33:29.710 --> 02:33:32.532]  Or go to ReadyReserveFoods.com and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:33:40.635 --> 02:33:45.597]  Now, I'm also a documentary filmmaker, and I have made 11 films.
[02:33:45.657 --> 02:33:51.420]  My 11th film, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004 is out.
[02:33:51.820 --> 02:34:00.705]  It shows how Bush and Kerry are actually identical on their policies, how they're related, how they're part of the same secret society, the police state they're setting up, how they're both for Patriot Act II.
[02:34:01.565 --> 02:34:02.746]  It's a great new film.
[02:34:02.906 --> 02:34:04.527]  You need to have 90 minutes long, 1995.
[02:34:06.048 --> 02:34:11.472]  Available on InfoWars.com or PresentPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:11.492 --> 02:34:11.812]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:34:21.954 --> 02:34:22.334]  We're good to go.
[02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:44.502]  George Humphrey's 9-11 film, which is excellent.
[02:34:44.822 --> 02:34:46.323]  Eric Huffman's 9-11 video.
[02:34:46.583 --> 02:34:47.764]  Two books on 9-11.
[02:34:47.984 --> 02:34:52.668]  It's all available at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:34:52.708 --> 02:35:03.196]  You can read both the books, watch all my videos, watch my weekly TV show that's posted there weekly, and listen to the best radio interviews we do, like this one, that will be posted by tomorrow.
[02:35:04.131 --> 02:35:05.692]  Again, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:35:06.032 --> 02:35:09.754]  All right, shifting gears back to our guest, Glitter and Greed.
[02:35:09.995 --> 02:35:16.398]  First off, before we get any deeper into this and take some calls, Janine, how do people get a copy of Glitter and Greed?
[02:35:17.119 --> 02:35:19.040]  I can get a copy of my film as well.
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:20.021]  It's on my website.
[02:35:20.061 --> 02:35:21.581]  You can take it off there.
[02:35:22.122 --> 02:35:22.882]  Oh, awesome.
[02:35:22.922 --> 02:35:23.723]  How do we go there?
[02:35:23.743 --> 02:35:29.366]  Yeah, I've got it on CDs and people can get through PayPal on my website.
[02:35:29.506 --> 02:35:30.947]  Can I just give my website address?
[02:35:31.127 --> 02:35:32.068]  Please do it, yes.
[02:35:33.143 --> 02:35:33.663]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:35:51.588 --> 02:35:56.332]  Okay, you got a little close to your phone there, I guess he's out on a boat.
[02:35:56.392 --> 02:35:57.613]  Sorry, I've done it again.
[02:35:57.693 --> 02:35:58.534]  It's to switch the boat.
[02:35:58.774 --> 02:35:59.755]  No, that's okay.
[02:35:59.775 --> 02:36:01.136]  Say that again, slowly.
[02:36:01.176 --> 02:36:02.597]  You want me to repeat it?
[02:36:02.657 --> 02:36:03.258]  Is that fine?
[02:36:03.498 --> 02:36:05.580]  Yeah, just say it slow again, the address.
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:06.200]  Okay.
[02:36:06.220 --> 02:36:07.341]  www.sparkle.plus.com
[02:36:16.525 --> 02:36:20.847]  All right, and we have a link to that on InfoWars.com.
[02:36:20.927 --> 02:36:22.727]  I highly recommend the film.
[02:36:23.268 --> 02:36:24.688]  The film's up there.
[02:36:24.788 --> 02:36:25.908]  The book, Tell the Story.
[02:36:26.209 --> 02:36:30.050]  I should say, by the time I finished doing that film, I was pretty pale in hospital.
[02:36:30.070 --> 02:36:32.231]  I was beaten up myself by a gang.
[02:36:33.471 --> 02:36:36.492]  And I was two months in hospital.
[02:36:37.073 --> 02:36:38.293]  It wasn't easy, personally.
[02:36:38.513 --> 02:36:40.074]  This is an amazing story.
[02:36:40.094 --> 02:36:41.354]  We could spend ten hours on it.
[02:36:41.594 --> 02:36:43.415]  Describe how you were beaten up by a gang.
[02:36:44.552 --> 02:37:13.279]  Uh, they, right in the middle of doing the shoot, it was just after the South African shoot, a gang broke into, broke up onto my boat actually, it was on a berth, and, um, there was a woman present, so I, they came, you know, they got onto the boat and then they smashed my face up basically, they broke my cheekbone, broke my nose, I had a, every blow drew blood, but I had to ship to shore emergency radio to contact the Coast Guard,
[02:37:14.269 --> 02:37:16.411]  And I just had to hit a button and I could yell at you.
[02:37:16.431 --> 02:37:28.139]  I didn't have to pick anything up and I yelled and the Coast Guard replied over the loudspeaker system and the gang fled and that's what saved me.
[02:37:28.219 --> 02:37:29.560]  Where were you when this happened?
[02:37:30.100 --> 02:37:30.900]  I was on the Thames.
[02:37:30.940 --> 02:37:31.841]  I was in London.
[02:37:31.881 --> 02:37:36.885]  Do you believe this was a hired gang or just a normal criminal gang?
[02:37:36.905 --> 02:37:41.788]  I think it was because lawyers ambushed me the next day and tried to take the film off me.
[02:37:42.739 --> 02:37:46.662]  And I was all black and blue, and I thought, this is just an amazing show.
[02:37:46.783 --> 02:37:47.944]  Say that again.
[02:37:48.044 --> 02:37:49.045]  Who tried to get your film?
[02:37:50.666 --> 02:37:54.129]  A group of lawyers tried to seize the film next day, but failed.
[02:37:56.111 --> 02:38:03.897]  They were just saying, with DeBeers opposed to you, you can't finish this film, so other people must take it over.
[02:38:04.838 --> 02:38:10.403]  But the film did get finished, and when it went out on PBS Network, it was according to my script.
[02:38:11.109 --> 02:38:12.030]  But it was all hell.
[02:38:13.551 --> 02:38:14.571]  I'm just pretty stubborn.
[02:38:14.631 --> 02:38:17.053]  I hate people trying to silence me.
[02:38:18.193 --> 02:38:20.475]  These big guys, they need someone to watch them.
[02:38:20.495 --> 02:38:22.776]  And that's what I did.
[02:38:23.156 --> 02:38:26.298]  Well, Janine, I mean, I recommend everybody, again, go to your website.
[02:38:26.979 --> 02:38:31.281]  And for those that missed it, just one more time, to get a DVD copy of the film.
[02:38:31.301 --> 02:38:33.162]  Tell them the name of the film and the website, please.
[02:38:33.503 --> 02:38:36.324]  Yeah, it's the film, The Diamond Empire.
[02:38:36.484 --> 02:38:37.505]  It's on my website.
[02:38:38.112 --> 02:38:38.892]  And it's on a CD.
[02:38:38.972 --> 02:38:40.073]  You don't need a DVD.
[02:38:40.093 --> 02:38:40.993]  You can do it on a CD.
[02:38:41.073 --> 02:38:42.833]  You can show it on any computer.
[02:38:43.694 --> 02:38:45.214]  Doesn't matter if it's a Mac or a PC.
[02:38:45.414 --> 02:38:45.714]  OK.
[02:38:47.575 --> 02:38:52.596]  And it comes in a collection of about a hundred photographs taken aside to be as mine by myself.
[02:38:54.037 --> 02:38:56.738]  And that's all on my website for $49.
[02:38:57.858 --> 02:39:01.719]  And the website is www.sparkle.com.
[02:39:05.638 --> 02:39:08.640]  Plus, P-L-U-S dot com, C-O-M.
[02:39:09.300 --> 02:39:11.061]  Alright, well that's amazing.
[02:39:11.721 --> 02:39:18.125]  If people want to email me from the site, I'm very welcome, happy to answer questions.
[02:39:18.225 --> 02:39:22.448]  Okay, well I want to take some time out to take a few calls here in a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:39:22.488 --> 02:39:28.511]  But first off, I mean there's so much to talk about here.
[02:39:28.531 --> 02:39:33.494]  I want to go back into the mechanics of the Oppenheimer family, their world monopoly over diamonds.
[02:39:34.534 --> 02:39:35.975]  And you've got the evidence.
[02:39:36.095 --> 02:39:40.818]  It's admitted that a carat diamond is five to six dollars per carat.
[02:39:41.198 --> 02:39:42.359]  Almost nothing to cut it.
[02:39:43.319 --> 02:39:47.341]  And then that their real business is making sure that diamonds don't get released out on the market.
[02:39:47.762 --> 02:39:48.882]  Where do they store?
[02:39:48.902 --> 02:39:50.363]  Because your film has some video of this.
[02:39:50.983 --> 02:39:51.744]  Where do they store?
[02:39:51.804 --> 02:39:53.064]  Yeah, I've seen the stores.
[02:39:53.845 --> 02:39:56.927]  I've actually run my hands through buckets of diamonds, literally.
[02:39:59.088 --> 02:40:00.969]  There's a major store in London.
[02:40:01.989 --> 02:40:03.190]  In Charterhouse Street.
[02:40:03.723 --> 02:40:05.344]  Controlled by De Beers directly.
[02:40:05.364 --> 02:40:08.826]  And it's like their personal treasure.
[02:40:08.846 --> 02:40:10.426]  It's very high security.
[02:40:11.327 --> 02:40:15.949]  Now for those who just joined us, explain, because you have video of this, how it works.
[02:40:16.509 --> 02:40:19.311]  Somebody's only allowed to come in once a year and buy diamonds.
[02:40:19.631 --> 02:40:24.353]  And if they don't... They pick about 50 diamond merchants out.
[02:40:25.034 --> 02:40:26.114]  And they have to be all men.
[02:40:26.154 --> 02:40:27.175]  They don't have to be good boys.
[02:40:27.195 --> 02:40:29.096]  They all have to be doing the things the company likes.
[02:40:30.116 --> 02:40:31.797]  And they have to buy the diamonds.
[02:40:32.441 --> 02:40:33.522]  Before they see them.
[02:40:34.543 --> 02:40:35.784]  So they have to pay.
[02:40:35.844 --> 02:40:36.904]  It's every five weeks.
[02:40:37.425 --> 02:40:38.546]  They have to come to London.
[02:40:39.066 --> 02:40:47.513]  And the reason that American merchants have to come to London, because in America it would be illegal under the Sherman Act, because of cartel activity.
[02:40:47.713 --> 02:40:48.373]  Antitrust.
[02:40:48.974 --> 02:40:50.355]  Yeah, under the Antitrust Act.
[02:40:51.176 --> 02:40:59.482]  So these rich American millionaires, billionaires that come across, they have to come across and pay in advance before they get their box of diamonds.
[02:41:00.259 --> 02:41:11.983]  And if they're being a good boy, so they haven't been buying any Russian diamonds or other diamonds that the beer doesn't control, then they might open their box up and find some really nice stones inside it.
[02:41:13.103 --> 02:41:22.726]  But if they've been bad, they've been buying some rebel diamonds or Russian diamonds or Australian diamonds, they'll cut their box and they might find worthless diamonds inside.
[02:41:23.867 --> 02:41:27.468]  And if they protest, they won't get an invitation again.
[02:41:28.883 --> 02:41:30.383]  So again, this is how the Monopoly works.
[02:41:30.423 --> 02:41:31.284]  This is all on video.
[02:41:31.304 --> 02:41:31.944]  This is admitted.
[02:41:32.424 --> 02:41:38.225]  You go in, and they hand you the box, and you've already prepaid, and that's what you get.
[02:41:38.526 --> 02:41:43.487]  But if you've bought any of the diamonds that aren't part of the Monopoly, and I've heard that the Monopoly still controls, what, 95%?
[02:41:43.627 --> 02:41:48.128]  Is that an accurate number, that they still control 95% of the diamonds?
[02:41:48.608 --> 02:41:52.089]  No, they're marketing more like they've fallen back a bit.
[02:41:52.169 --> 02:41:54.670]  It's more like they're marketing around 70 to 80% now.
[02:41:56.713 --> 02:42:01.857]  So since I read articles about it a few years ago that they've even lost more control over their monopoly?
[02:42:01.897 --> 02:42:04.299]  They always pretend to have more control than they really have.
[02:42:05.099 --> 02:42:10.583]  But they have secret slush funds around to buy up diamonds in different countries.
[02:42:11.324 --> 02:42:18.369]  And the trouble with the Canadian diamonds is that the Canadian companies and the Russian companies are outside De Beers.
[02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:23.573]  But why should they cut the price of their stones when De Beers keeps the price high?
[02:42:23.593 --> 02:42:26.035]  It doesn't pay them to undercut.
[02:42:26.658 --> 02:42:33.804]  So there's a kind of informal cartel being organized, including the stones outside De Beers control, like the Canadian stones.
[02:42:34.704 --> 02:42:37.626]  They're not undercutting De Beers stones, so they're getting ripped off too.
[02:42:38.147 --> 02:42:50.096]  So, I mean, how much, you know, when an average merchant comes, do they say, this is how much money I want to pay, this is how many diamonds I want, or does De Beers tell them, this is how much money you've got to pay us, and then you'll just see what you get?
[02:42:50.116 --> 02:42:53.759]  This is a case that De Beers set the price, totally set the price.
[02:42:54.781 --> 02:42:59.383]  And even tell us the miners contracted to it what the price is, what the value of their own stones are.
[02:43:00.844 --> 02:43:07.428]  You know, you send your diamonds in and the customer De Beers would tell you what your diamonds are worth and pay that sum.
[02:43:08.628 --> 02:43:10.689]  That's how the rough diamonds get sold to De Beers.
[02:43:11.350 --> 02:43:16.292]  Okay, so somebody comes in and buys this black box, this case of diamonds.
[02:43:16.813 --> 02:43:23.316]  What is the real value on average of what they really dug them out of the ground for versus what De Beers sells them wholesale?
[02:43:25.037 --> 02:43:28.178]  I can't really tell, because it's very, very secret, that little bit of it.
[02:43:30.538 --> 02:43:36.399]  But I think it would be less than a fifth, maybe less than a tenth of what they're actually paying.
[02:43:37.900 --> 02:43:39.120]  It depends who you are, you see.
[02:43:39.140 --> 02:43:43.641]  Like, there's this very powerful businessman, Maurice Templesman, in New York.
[02:43:44.721 --> 02:43:47.802]  And he's been a very close friend of many presidents.
[02:43:48.702 --> 02:43:51.782]  And he's the most... and I have two chapters in my book about him.
[02:43:51.822 --> 02:43:53.843]  He's the most powerful diamond merchant in the world.
[02:43:54.938 --> 02:43:57.099]  And he's very, very close to the CIA.
[02:43:57.739 --> 02:44:16.926]  And he's been involved in several coups in Africa against... One of them, let's see, one of them was a telephone call was intercepted by intelligence and it was a coup in West Africa and the communications point back to the States were coming through his office in the United States.
[02:44:17.967 --> 02:44:20.648]  And the State Department got very angry with him
[02:44:21.297 --> 02:44:27.339]  Because he used an unguarded telephone line, and he betrayed the identity of the CIA head of station.
[02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:30.241]  And so what happens is he gets the diamonds real cheap.
[02:44:31.261 --> 02:44:35.523]  Yeah, the whole thing is very very intelligence led, it's very covert.
[02:44:36.263 --> 02:44:39.444]  There's lots of nasty business going on to keep this cartel together.
[02:44:41.025 --> 02:44:45.106]  And it's... Our people are just being exploited for the roof.
[02:44:45.607 --> 02:44:48.868]  And by keeping the price of diamonds so high, when they're so cheap to produce,
[02:44:49.676 --> 02:44:51.396]  That's why terrorists can now use them.
[02:44:51.977 --> 02:44:54.197]  Because they're easy, they're common in Africa.
[02:44:55.037 --> 02:44:57.698]  So, you may as well, they're common in Arkansas.
[02:44:58.278 --> 02:44:59.779]  They're not just rare stones.
[02:45:00.559 --> 02:45:09.721]  I went to Arkansas, to this diamond mine, and I got all the geology reports for this diamond mine down in Arkansas.
[02:45:10.261 --> 02:45:15.503]  What I did, I went and used Freedom of Information in Washington to get the
[02:45:17.102 --> 02:45:22.123]  Justice Department's investigations of De Beers as an illegal cartel.
[02:45:22.763 --> 02:45:29.244]  And I found all these memos and letters and things and I've used them in the book and I reproduced them in the book and I used them in the film.
[02:45:31.185 --> 02:45:34.145]  Anyway, the Arkansas has got a really good deposit of diamonds.
[02:45:34.225 --> 02:45:36.986]  All the geology reports say it's as good as anything in South Africa.
[02:45:38.126 --> 02:45:44.447]  If you go to Arkansas today, it's a National Partner Diamond Mine and you're not allowed to dig deeper than four feet.
[02:45:46.554 --> 02:45:48.355]  And then you must fill up the hole when you finish.
[02:45:48.735 --> 02:45:49.975]  And again, I've been there.
[02:45:50.035 --> 02:45:50.875]  This is what they do.
[02:45:51.556 --> 02:45:59.778]  We've got this giant diamond deposit for the American people and we're not even allowed to have those diamonds because it's for environmental reasons.
[02:46:01.018 --> 02:46:03.599]  So, anything to keep the monopoly in place?
[02:46:04.159 --> 02:46:09.180]  Well, the only place in the world that a diamond mine could not be controlled by the cartel is the United States.
[02:46:10.101 --> 02:46:11.381]  Because of the Antitrust Act.
[02:46:12.868 --> 02:46:15.650]  So, that's what the family that used to own it believed.
[02:46:15.690 --> 02:46:18.372]  They believed that their mine was sabotaged by De Beers.
[02:46:19.012 --> 02:46:19.853]  That's what they told me.
[02:46:19.873 --> 02:46:26.377]  Well, I know that family, uh, you know, very well, and that's exactly what happened to the Bull family.
[02:46:27.338 --> 02:46:28.559]  Yeah, fine people.
[02:46:29.540 --> 02:46:30.800]  They got run off their own land.
[02:46:31.481 --> 02:46:38.426]  And, and to even stick, when the Second World War was going on, and diamonds were absolutely frightening.
[02:46:38.466 --> 02:46:41.848]  You know, Ford used to use diamonds from Arkansas,
[02:46:42.338 --> 02:46:44.800]  To cut the steel for his TE Model Fords.
[02:46:46.421 --> 02:46:48.983]  And then they shot down the mine.
[02:46:49.103 --> 02:46:50.944]  He offered to buy the mine, Henry Ford.
[02:46:50.964 --> 02:46:52.966]  So he could keep getting the diamonds.
[02:46:52.986 --> 02:46:55.948]  He said they were better than anything he could get out of Africa, the Arkansas diamonds.
[02:46:57.409 --> 02:46:59.590]  And they still closed it down, but he'd offered to buy it.
[02:47:00.591 --> 02:47:08.537]  And during the Second World War, when the United States needed diamonds to make weapons to fight Hitler, that mine was kept shut.
[02:47:10.097 --> 02:47:14.618]  Even though it's really needed for strategic needs to defend the United States.
[02:47:15.078 --> 02:47:21.539]  So there's the power of this monopoly and then top people connected to the CIA get their special deals on the diamonds.
[02:47:21.559 --> 02:47:23.599]  So whether it's... Oh yeah, it's the same as you said.
[02:47:23.639 --> 02:47:25.000]  There's oil and diamonds.
[02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:26.140]  It's all the same.
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:28.860]  It's just pity there's blood on this stone.
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:38.862]  You know, what I've been campaigning for is that diamonds should be... They should come out, like, from Africa with a guarantee that the mine has got no corruption in it,
[02:47:39.454 --> 02:47:49.459]  That it's used good worker practices, that the diamonds have been cut by people that have been paid decently, and the diamonds then should be sold with a certificate saying that.
[02:47:50.260 --> 02:47:54.702]  But then the Africans could get money from their diamonds, because why should there be so much poverty in Africa?
[02:47:54.782 --> 02:47:59.044]  Why is there disease, poverty, rape and destruction happening in Africa?
[02:47:59.164 --> 02:48:05.667]  When Africa is rolling in sweet crude oil, gold, diamonds, rubies, everything else you can imagine.
[02:48:08.144 --> 02:48:11.685]  Our companies have created the mess that is Africa.
[02:48:12.646 --> 02:48:15.106]  And we're not doing much about it.
[02:48:15.166 --> 02:48:19.028]  You know, when I see what's going on out there and I see the richness of it.
[02:48:19.048 --> 02:48:20.248]  It's a beautiful country.
[02:48:20.368 --> 02:48:21.648]  It's a wonderful place, Africa.
[02:48:22.429 --> 02:48:23.869]  And I love it.
[02:48:23.929 --> 02:48:25.070]  Well, let me just add this.
[02:48:25.090 --> 02:48:25.670]  We've got a break.
[02:48:25.690 --> 02:48:26.850]  We'll come back and take a few calls.
[02:48:27.690 --> 02:48:28.191]  Think about it.
[02:48:28.211 --> 02:48:33.132]  You go in there like a sap to buy a one carat diamond ring that costs $5,000 and it costs them one
[02:48:36.553 --> 02:48:39.816]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:48:49.642 --> 02:48:50.943]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:51.143 --> 02:48:56.885]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:57.145 --> 02:49:02.406]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:02.707 --> 02:49:06.808]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:49:07.008 --> 02:49:10.793]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:11.073 --> 02:49:15.699]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:15.779 --> 02:49:22.047]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.107 --> 02:49:23.930]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:51:40.130 --> 02:51:51.793]  I mean, I hope people realize the magnitude of what they're hearing.
[02:51:53.900 --> 02:51:55.261]  Diamonds are all over Africa.
[02:51:55.882 --> 02:51:57.183]  Just sitting on the ground.
[02:51:58.044 --> 02:52:01.508]  They're all over Arkansas.
[02:52:01.528 --> 02:52:03.089]  You go to a state park, pay some money.
[02:52:03.109 --> 02:52:03.610]  I've been there.
[02:52:03.650 --> 02:52:04.331]  You dig in the ground.
[02:52:04.351 --> 02:52:05.912]  You find little diamonds all over the place.
[02:52:06.273 --> 02:52:09.135]  You're not allowed to dig again under four feet.
[02:52:09.175 --> 02:52:10.897]  And it's all been dug over a hundred times.
[02:52:10.937 --> 02:52:13.480]  But the ground literally glistens with small pieces of diamond.
[02:52:14.498 --> 02:52:15.738]  Uh, but no, you can't have that.
[02:52:15.918 --> 02:52:16.779]  It's for the environment.
[02:52:16.799 --> 02:52:17.959]  You know, there's always a reason.
[02:52:18.419 --> 02:52:20.879]  Just like our oil in Alaska, all that sweet crude.
[02:52:21.159 --> 02:52:23.080]  Run the country for a hundred years in one field.
[02:52:23.480 --> 02:52:24.720]  It's about monopoly.
[02:52:25.300 --> 02:52:35.842]  And they'll tell you it's scarce, and they'll have their liars tell you there's no oil, and their liars tell you there's no diamonds, and their liars now saying there's no fresh water, and it's all part of these foreman cartels.
[02:52:36.483 --> 02:52:38.923]  And by the way, the CIA's involved in the narcotics, too.
[02:52:39.883 --> 02:52:41.344]  They control these monopolies.
[02:52:42.524 --> 02:52:43.424]  And it's a sick joke.
[02:52:44.473 --> 02:52:48.454]  We're talking to Janine Roberts, who's made an incredible film and written a powerful book.
[02:52:48.934 --> 02:52:51.355]  She's going to stay with us a little bit in the next hour to take all these calls.
[02:52:52.455 --> 02:52:54.696]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Tennessee.
[02:52:55.056 --> 02:52:56.376]  Don, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:52:56.416 --> 02:52:57.217]  Question or comment?
[02:52:57.397 --> 02:52:58.757]  Well, I'd like to make a comment.
[02:52:58.837 --> 02:53:12.741]  I believe I have seen her video on PBS before, because when you started commenting about people having appointments to go over there and meet them, all that kind of
[02:53:14.226 --> 02:53:23.053]  It's stuck in my brain and I seem to recall all this and it's very interesting that you say that because I believe I've already seen this on TV once before.
[02:53:23.333 --> 02:53:24.494]  Yeah, it aired years ago.
[02:53:24.514 --> 02:53:25.795]  Okay.
[02:53:25.895 --> 02:53:26.815]  Years ago.
[02:53:27.076 --> 02:53:28.176]  It's about 95.
[02:53:28.216 --> 02:53:28.176]  95?
[02:53:28.457 --> 02:53:29.077]  Okay.
[02:53:29.778 --> 02:53:31.939]  And then Alex, I have a comment for you.
[02:53:31.959 --> 02:53:39.545]  I was watching ESPN2 last night and they showed a commercial about militias in the U.S.
[02:53:40.505 --> 02:53:43.488]  and have you done anything about militias because
[02:53:44.608 --> 02:53:54.435]  Two of the people that they've shown, I could have sworn one of them was you because they're going to be airing this special Friday night at 8pm on ESPN2.
[02:53:55.416 --> 02:53:56.237]  I haven't done that.
[02:53:56.257 --> 02:53:58.278]  I've done lots of stuff on CIA.
[02:53:58.338 --> 02:54:00.220]  I've interviewed KGB generals.
[02:54:01.229 --> 02:54:04.731]  You know, I've been around, I've been to a few radio agents.
[02:54:05.191 --> 02:54:20.777]  Yeah, I've been interviewed, I don't know, six, seven times by Japanese, British, American TV, and I did do an interview that was supposedly going to be airing on TNN about militias, and you said you thought it was... That's an official subject.
[02:54:20.998 --> 02:54:23.018]  Yes, it's going to be 8 p.m.
[02:54:23.138 --> 02:54:26.840]  Friday evening, this Friday, on ESPN2.
[02:54:27.060 --> 02:54:28.941]  I wrote this down last night when I was saying this.
[02:54:30.535 --> 02:54:31.516]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:54:31.636 --> 02:54:32.596]  Okay.
[02:54:32.656 --> 02:54:35.678]  Yeah, that's a separate issue about myself, Janine.
[02:54:36.318 --> 02:54:36.718]  Okay.
[02:54:36.999 --> 02:54:42.021]  But no, the government's demonizing anybody that wants to fight against the police state here in America.
[02:54:42.742 --> 02:54:44.583]  Let's go ahead and talk... I'm well aware of it.
[02:54:44.723 --> 02:54:46.264]  I've been in states many times.
[02:54:47.464 --> 02:54:49.946]  Let's talk to Leon in Texas.
[02:54:50.006 --> 02:54:50.906]  Leon, you're on the air.
[02:54:50.966 --> 02:54:51.367]  Go ahead.
[02:54:51.727 --> 02:54:52.087]  Howdy.
[02:54:52.547 --> 02:54:52.747]  Yes.
[02:54:52.827 --> 02:54:53.128]  Hiya.
[02:54:53.408 --> 02:54:58.551]  I've been studying the Mexican Revolution for about eight years now.
[02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:04.081]  And the Guggenheims pop up all the time.
[02:55:05.161 --> 02:55:06.002]  The Oppenheimers.
[02:55:07.702 --> 02:55:08.602]  No, the Guggenheims.
[02:55:08.922 --> 02:55:09.642]  Different family.
[02:55:10.443 --> 02:55:13.703]  In the personage of American Smelting and Refining Company.
[02:55:15.624 --> 02:55:21.925]  And, you know, they're big in zinc mining, silver mining, bunches of other stuff.
[02:55:21.966 --> 02:55:22.626]  Not just diamonds.
[02:55:23.486 --> 02:55:26.627]  Yeah, but lots of really big families that come up again and again.
[02:55:26.667 --> 02:55:27.847]  And that is the Rothschilds.
[02:55:28.598 --> 02:55:36.401]  The Rothschild family are on the De Beers board and recently they're really complaining because of the anti-cartel action against De Beers in the States.
[02:55:37.342 --> 02:55:43.964]  The wife of the family, the Rothschild, can't go shopping in New York.
[02:55:44.184 --> 02:55:47.606]  She lives in Europe because she might get arrested when she steps ashore.
[02:55:49.927 --> 02:55:52.167]  So yeah, these families are interlocked.
[02:55:52.748 --> 02:55:54.989]  Different families control different things.
[02:55:55.389 --> 02:55:58.350]  I look at all this stuff and
[02:55:59.830 --> 02:56:13.882]  Uh, momentarily I get distracted from studying the Mexican Revolution, and I start studying the Rift War in Spanish and French Morocco, and guess what?
[02:56:14.262 --> 02:56:18.506]  Same company involved in the whole thing.
[02:56:19.452 --> 02:56:19.652]  Yeah.
[02:56:19.952 --> 02:56:20.733]  That's what they do.
[02:56:20.753 --> 02:56:26.196]  If they want an actual resource, they go in and create a revolution or claim terrorists are there and we invade.
[02:56:26.597 --> 02:56:27.717]  That's about the size of it.
[02:56:27.918 --> 02:56:28.678]  I hear the music.
[02:56:29.098 --> 02:56:29.639]  Are you a professor?
[02:56:29.659 --> 02:56:31.620]  I say that's a bit of a rock in there too.
[02:56:32.381 --> 02:56:33.741]  I tell you what, stay there.
[02:56:33.841 --> 02:56:34.462]  Stay there, Leon.
