[00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:09.720]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:11.201]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:12.822]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:17.164]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.767]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.223 --> 00:00:41.504]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:41.924]  Welcome.
[00:00:41.964 --> 00:00:45.266]  Thank you so much for joining me today.
[00:00:46.507 --> 00:00:49.610]  It's already the 23rd day of November 2004.
[00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.871]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:52.332 --> 00:00:54.613]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:55.854 --> 00:01:01.879]  Investigator says jet was flying hundreds of feet too low prior to crash.
[00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:10.286]  Talking about yesterday morning, a private jet coming in to pick up George Herbert Walker Bush, the elder.
[00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:21.450]  Bush 41 supposedly clipped a toll road light and crashed into a field of rubble from the planes.
[00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.172]  Pieces of it did hit cars, but no serious injuries.
[00:01:25.632 --> 00:01:32.374]  All three on board, both the pilot and co-pilot and a stewardess, a servant, were killed.
[00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:41.153]  He was on his way to Ecuador for Latin American affairs and some business deals.
[00:01:41.213 --> 00:01:45.819]  I guess to tie up some deals his son had just gotten done showing up there.
[00:01:48.882 --> 00:01:51.345]  So we'll be getting into this article also.
[00:01:51.565 --> 00:01:55.309]  Mass offensive launched south of Baghdad.
[00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:57.123]  Some 5,000 U.S.
[00:01:57.423 --> 00:02:10.008]  Marines, British troops, and Iraqi commandos launched raids and arrested suspected insurgents today in a new offensive aimed at clearing a swath of insurgent hotbeds south of Baghdad, the U.S.
[00:02:10.108 --> 00:02:11.208]  military said.
[00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.670]  Continuing, U.K.
[00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.611]  Defense Secretary I'd Blast Iran
[00:02:19.542 --> 00:02:27.529]  The London Newspapers are reporting that Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon is saying they'd go ahead and press the button and launch the attack.
[00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:42.621]  Alberto, I love, Torture Gonzales, the architect of Abu Ghraib and enemy combatant designations in much of Patriot Act 1 and 2, it turns out is a member of La Raza!
[00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:46.965]  And again, La Raza, my friends, especially when he was a member of it,
[00:02:47.706 --> 00:02:50.507]  Openly called for kicking whites out of the Southwest.
[00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.229]  It's kind of a Hispanic Klan group.
[00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.631]  So, we'll be covering that as well.
[00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:03.514]  Government uses color laser print technology to track documents.
[00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:11.197]  Yes, my friends, I remember a few years ago where they were going to have RFID in the printer ink.
[00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:23.898]  And then when you buy it using a credit card, they're going to scan it according to that serial number into a database, and now anything you've printed or done has your name on it.
[00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:24.459]  See?
[00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.500]  Everything tracked.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.262]  It's part of total information awareness.
[00:03:29.423 --> 00:03:30.924]  So we'll be getting into that.
[00:03:30.984 --> 00:03:33.886]  Now it's actually happening, not just talking about it.
[00:03:36.488 --> 00:03:37.910]  Also, hybrid animals
[00:03:39.662 --> 00:03:46.305]  They're openly cloning humans, crossing them with animals, because that makes it legal, and we'll cover this first when we get back.
[00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:47.626]  Scientists debate.
[00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:50.527]  Blending Species, the Washington Post.
[00:03:51.607 --> 00:03:55.509]  It's been happening for years, and now they're unveiling it and announcing it.
[00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.392]  Smart Dust may soon be watching you.
[00:04:02.836 --> 00:04:05.619]  This is out of King 5 Television in Seattle.
[00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.922]  We're just going to sprinkle it around to watch and control you.
[00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.504]  It's all part of new freedom.
[00:04:13.325 --> 00:04:15.047]  But remember, none of this is fascist.
[00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:17.349]  It's neoconservative.
[00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.592]  Euro rises even more today.
[00:04:20.672 --> 00:04:24.155]  Dollar goes down even further to new records.
[00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:27.138]  Now a daily occurrence.
[00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:34.602]  The average yuppie has no idea even what I'm talking about.
[00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:38.343]  The U.S.
[00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:43.705]  withdraws 100 tanks from Korea, moves them to Iraq in a serious move.
[00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:49.947]  My friends, that's just some of what is coming up today.
[00:04:51.067 --> 00:04:56.429]  And some of the latest developments with our movement, Americans Against Arnold, ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.050]  Don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv, stay with us.
[00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.112]  Dad, that cocoon stuff really got rid of your gray hair!
[00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:10.816]  I'm that 44 year old guy you've heard talking about taking Cocoon GH and how it helped reverse my gray hairs.
[00:05:10.917 --> 00:05:12.738]  And here's some more great news.
[00:05:12.838 --> 00:05:16.340]  Taking Cocoon GH can improve your life in many ways.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.844]  Cocoon basically repairs your body to a youthful state you perhaps had 10 or 20 years ago.
[00:05:22.064 --> 00:05:24.625]  I'm taking Cocoon GH and here's what I notice.
[00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:29.969]  After a few sprays in my mouth, I'm in peak condition mentally, emotionally, and physically.
[00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.250]  In the state I get from Cocoon, I feel unstoppable.
[00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:35.371]  And you can have the same feeling.
[00:05:35.631 --> 00:05:45.576]  If you're tired, run down, want to boost your sexual performance, want to help wipe out back pain or arthritis, you need to start taking Cocoon GH right now.
[00:05:45.876 --> 00:05:49.978]  If you want similar results, call now to order Cocoon GH.
[00:05:50.118 --> 00:05:50.938]  Here's the number.
[00:05:50.998 --> 00:05:51.658]  800-814-5031.
[00:05:51.678 --> 00:05:53.859]  800-814-5031.
[00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:54.659]  800-814-5031.
[00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:03.301]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:06.422]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.682 --> 00:06:10.843]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.263 --> 00:06:12.103]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.403 --> 00:06:16.984]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.464 --> 00:06:19.586]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.087 --> 00:06:34.801]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:41.908]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.248 --> 00:06:46.652]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:47.092 --> 00:06:48.853]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.873 --> 00:06:49.094]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.114 --> 00:06:50.655]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:04.452]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:09.054]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:13.597]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:13.637 --> 00:07:14.978]  The New World Order.
[00:07:15.758 --> 00:07:16.719]  Panama!
[00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.982]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:27.966]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.106 --> 00:07:30.187]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.468 --> 00:07:40.874]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.114 --> 00:07:43.856]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[00:07:43.936 --> 00:07:44.516]  Big Brother.
[00:07:44.556 --> 00:07:45.156]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:45.216 --> 00:07:46.237]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:47.517]  You want answers?
[00:07:47.537 --> 00:07:48.097]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.499 --> 00:08:17.442]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.683 --> 00:08:21.826]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:32.935]  There have been a lot of issues that we've been neglecting here really in the last year.
[00:08:34.276 --> 00:08:38.360]  I've been so focused on the Iraq War and the election and the New World Orders
[00:08:39.554 --> 00:08:54.503]  Electronic Satellite Tracking Taxation RFID Control Grid, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, Victory Act, that I haven't gotten into some of the topics that, well, we really pioneered on this show years ago.
[00:08:56.324 --> 00:09:00.026]  Human cloning, been going on for at least nine years, openly.
[00:09:00.987 --> 00:09:06.330]  Chimeras, or chimeras, crosses between humans and animals, going on for decades.
[00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:09.979]  Fluoride in your water.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.781]  What aspartame, now in 9,000 food products, does to your brain and body.
[00:09:17.522 --> 00:09:18.722]  So many issues.
[00:09:18.862 --> 00:09:20.203]  Frequency pollution.
[00:09:21.203 --> 00:09:24.244]  That is what the high-powered power lines do, what cell phones do to you.
[00:09:24.844 --> 00:09:31.246]  These are some of the subjects I want to get back into and we're going to have a bunch of guests on along these lines.
[00:09:32.486 --> 00:09:34.547]  Now, granted, this year I had some guests on.
[00:09:35.382 --> 00:09:38.905]  Some doctors and bioethics scientists on both sides of it on.
[00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:52.357]  We talk about how New Jersey and California and several other states legalized, they call it stem cell research, growing a baby in a surrogate mother, a clone, up to birth and keeping it alive in a tank.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.321]  And that's going on in a bunch of different states right now.
[00:09:56.841 --> 00:10:05.203]  And so when you hear Bush and everybody talk about stem cell, or Arnold talk about it, or Hillary talk about it, or Christopher Reeve before he talked about it, we're not talking about a baby part.
[00:10:05.763 --> 00:10:09.643]  We're talking about, that's a little code word for clones, humans.
[00:10:10.824 --> 00:10:21.066]  But what they do is they add a little bit of animal, now that's been legalized by the way, but they add a little bit of animal genes to it and then they can use it for whatever they want saying it's not human.
[00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:42.237]  And these laboratories are locked up tight, and they're real secretive about it, but occasionally in their own policy reports, and their own scientific papers, scientists like to brag, laboratories like to brag, biotech likes to brag to boost their stock, in the industry publications, and we learn of the horrors that are going on.
[00:10:42.317 --> 00:10:45.059]  Well, it always seems to happen in a flood.
[00:10:46.319 --> 00:10:49.461]  I'm telling you about government plans to forcibly put chips in you,
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.762]  And to sell it as a fad, five, six years ago, and now it's mainstream news everywhere.
[00:10:55.702 --> 00:11:05.866]  I tell you about satellite tracker boxes in the cars, and then when they finally get ready to do it, they announce it and tell you how great it is, and now it's wall-to-wall, all over TV, radio, and print.
[00:11:07.307 --> 00:11:12.929]  The major polls show that everybody's against all this stuff, but the media is almost universally being positive about it.
[00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:20.086]  So there's the two worlds, and people sit there and read this and think, oh, I must be alone, I guess cloning's okay.
[00:11:20.906 --> 00:11:22.287]  When we are the majority.
[00:11:24.227 --> 00:11:27.908]  Now, again, I don't say this to go, ooh, look, I'm tooting my horn, you better listen to me.
[00:11:28.008 --> 00:11:31.848]  It's just that I only talk about stuff that's documented and real and demonstratable.
[00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:36.709]  That's why we have an excellent track record of being very accurate here.
[00:11:36.749 --> 00:11:40.770]  When we're not accurate occasionally, we will correct ourselves in a copious fashion.
[00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.309]  In a prodigious fashion.
[00:11:46.511 --> 00:11:48.412]  I wish I was wrong, but I'm not wrong.
[00:11:48.493 --> 00:11:49.653]  I know how the world works.
[00:11:49.774 --> 00:11:50.994]  I spent my life studying it.
[00:11:51.035 --> 00:11:51.935]  I understand history.
[00:11:52.235 --> 00:11:56.819]  I know what the global elite's plans are from their own policy reports and their own bragging.
[00:11:57.239 --> 00:12:02.664]  And you can see the architecture of doom, the architecture of the New World Order, all around you.
[00:12:04.145 --> 00:12:08.128]  Now, I want to go over this information.
[00:12:09.494 --> 00:12:19.882]  Because what they do is, once they condition you and accept it, and once they acclimate you, just to getting used to hearing about it, then they go ahead and make it public.
[00:12:22.684 --> 00:12:36.615]  And by public, it's always been public, but now it's in the front page of USA Today, and the Washington Post, and the New York Times, and the Associated Press, and Reuters, and UPI, and a hundred other publications, literally, that I've seen over the weekend.
[00:12:37.859 --> 00:12:40.720]  Scientists debate blending species.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.361]  Now, that headline makes you think they're debating it.
[00:12:45.122 --> 00:12:46.082]  But they're not debating it.
[00:12:46.102 --> 00:12:46.962]  Let's read the article.
[00:12:47.623 --> 00:12:51.344]  Washington Post from yesterday, November 22nd.
[00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:57.446]  In Minnesota, pigs are being born with human blood in their veins.
[00:12:58.067 --> 00:13:01.968]  In Nevada, there are sheep whose livers and hearts are largely human.
[00:13:02.739 --> 00:13:08.982]  In California, mice peer from their cages with human brain cells firing inside their skulls.
[00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:15.705]  These are not outcasts from the Island of Dr. Maru, the 1896 novel by H.G.
[00:13:15.765 --> 00:13:20.147]  Wells in which a rogue doctor develops creatures that are part animal and part human.
[00:13:21.248 --> 00:13:22.548]  The Nazis did that, folks.
[00:13:22.988 --> 00:13:26.310]  They are real creations of real scientists.
[00:13:27.583 --> 00:13:35.369]  Biologists call these hybrids chimeras, after the mythical Greek creature with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail.
[00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:42.575]  They are products of experiments in which human stem cells were added to developing animal fetuses.
[00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:53.324]  Chimeras are allowing scientists to watch for the first time how nascent human cells and organs mature and interact.
[00:13:54.056 --> 00:13:58.997]  Not in the cold isolation of laboratory dishes, but inside the bodies of living creatures.
[00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:06.319]  Some are already revealing deep secrets of human biology, and pointing the way towards new medical treatments.
[00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:11.741]  But with no federal guidelines in place, an awkward question hovers about the work.
[00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:18.122]  How human must a chimera be before more stringent research rules should kick in?
[00:14:18.202 --> 00:14:21.043]  Now again, let's stop right there.
[00:14:22.034 --> 00:14:25.236]  You talk to the average person, they go, oh, we can't clone yet.
[00:14:25.776 --> 00:14:27.417]  Oh, we got laws against that.
[00:14:27.837 --> 00:14:29.438]  Oh, President Bush is against it.
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:32.520]  Uh, no.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:39.684]  President Bush and Arnold Schwarzenegger and all the rest of them have given record funding to this.
[00:14:41.085 --> 00:14:45.648]  It's like Bush's speech and the other speeches at the Republican Convention.
[00:14:45.708 --> 00:14:47.349]  I sat there with my eyes watching him.
[00:14:47.369 --> 00:14:48.349]  Forget watching TV.
[00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:49.390]  I was there!
[00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:52.270]  And he said, I'm against stem cells.
[00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:57.811]  Well, I'm against using it for money and against mature stem cells.
[00:14:57.831 --> 00:14:58.912]  I guess that means a born baby.
[00:14:59.292 --> 00:15:02.833]  But I've given record billions in funding, which is true.
[00:15:04.533 --> 00:15:07.214]  And he, quote, capitulated to the UN last week.
[00:15:07.314 --> 00:15:09.155]  Okay, we won't have a cloning treaty.
[00:15:09.175 --> 00:15:09.855]  It's totally legal.
[00:15:10.935 --> 00:15:13.736]  And then states are all passing, and the feds have passed no law.
[00:15:13.956 --> 00:15:18.337]  The states are passing laws saying there is nothing, no controls.
[00:15:18.397 --> 00:15:20.178]  Forget chimeras or chimeras.
[00:15:22.478 --> 00:15:23.599]  You know, they can do whatever they want.
[00:15:23.619 --> 00:15:28.621]  They got Humanzis, now they've announced, for years, in Argentina.
[00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:34.864]  They won't let you in to videotape them, I predict soon they will, but these chimpanzees cross with a human.
[00:15:35.524 --> 00:15:36.965]  That should be totally illegal.
[00:15:37.005 --> 00:15:44.348]  They should grab the people that did it, and they should put them in prison for life and pass a death penalty if anybody else does it.
[00:15:46.409 --> 00:15:47.730]  But that ain't gonna happen, folks.
[00:15:49.091 --> 00:15:49.991]  No, it's not gonna happen.
[00:15:52.043 --> 00:15:57.628]  And I predict within 15 years you'll be able to buy your own slave Humanzee.
[00:15:57.648 --> 00:16:01.292]  Of course, right now it's for organ harvest.
[00:16:01.332 --> 00:16:03.394]  They create these humanoid poor creatures.
[00:16:05.035 --> 00:16:05.816]  And they gut them.
[00:16:07.557 --> 00:16:09.860]  And they're getting ready to start selling these on the open market.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.405]  And they're going to sell it to you in the media as, well, you deserve a new liver, or heart, or lungs, or skin.
[00:16:16.536 --> 00:16:17.297]  And they're going to use them.
[00:16:17.317 --> 00:16:20.099]  You know, they're going to farm them for their blood and their cosmetics.
[00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:22.761]  And, ooh, have a Humanzee skin graft over your wrinkles.
[00:16:23.641 --> 00:16:27.504]  Have Humanzee brains, you know, put into that area because you've got Parkinson's.
[00:16:29.886 --> 00:16:34.689]  Because, you see, baby cells, fetus cells, can do anything.
[00:16:36.251 --> 00:16:41.995]  Scientists first discovered this a hundred years ago when they would find fully formed teeth in a woman's uterus.
[00:16:43.553 --> 00:16:50.699]  They'd find a woman would die and they'd find a baby that had been alive for a decade and grown up to child size in women.
[00:16:50.739 --> 00:16:52.240]  You know, grown up to 40 pounds.
[00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:56.864]  They'd find just all types of stuff.
[00:16:56.904 --> 00:16:57.925]  They'd known about this for a long time.
[00:16:57.945 --> 00:17:00.306]  So then the last few decades they learned this is stem cells.
[00:17:00.647 --> 00:17:01.367]  You can do anything.
[00:17:01.407 --> 00:17:03.949]  They can take stem cells and grow teeth on a Petri dish.
[00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.132]  As long as they give it a blood supply, an oxygen supply, a nutrient supply.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:17.569]  I got articles here today where, oh yeah, we're growing embryos inside mice, little miniature babies, and then we take them out and use them for body parts, and we don't have to pay a woman to grow it in her womb.
[00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:34.604]  I remember five years ago, a quiet British test, growing human embryos inside cows, because you can grow the human, humanoid, up to a larger size to get larger organ parts and a bigger tissue harvest out of it.
[00:17:35.911 --> 00:17:37.333]  And this is the stuff they're now admitting.
[00:17:37.353 --> 00:17:38.815]  Remember, they're 25 years ahead.
[00:17:38.915 --> 00:17:42.479]  All those big government laboratories, those underground facilities.
[00:17:42.919 --> 00:17:51.810]  They've had so many doctors and scientists on who they've tried to recruit, and who were recruited in some cases, into these cybernetic, cyborg laboratories.
[00:17:53.692 --> 00:17:55.393]  My dad's an oral surgeon and dentist.
[00:17:55.473 --> 00:17:59.394]  Back in the mid-80s, he said, we may all move to Maryland.
[00:17:59.774 --> 00:18:00.955]  We may move to Virginia.
[00:18:01.535 --> 00:18:04.876]  I can't tell you much about it, but it's cyborg work.
[00:18:05.256 --> 00:18:11.819]  My dad was a medical school professor for oral surgery and stuff.
[00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:14.220]  He was the top of his class and all that stuff.
[00:18:16.147 --> 00:18:22.972]  He was also an anti-communist when he was in college, and marched around when he was in high school, and the young Americans and all that.
[00:18:23.012 --> 00:18:24.894]  So he had a good file.
[00:18:25.935 --> 00:18:30.498]  But I mean, it's a lot of other doctors and dentists that he's talked to, that I've talked to, we've had them on the show.
[00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:33.080]  People who were in the programs, didn't go into the programs.
[00:18:33.541 --> 00:18:45.110]  We almost moved, when I was in high school, to the East Coast, and my dad couldn't talk about it, just that it was cybernetic, cyborg stuff.
[00:18:45.805 --> 00:18:49.048]  Because he was an expert in grafting metal into bone.
[00:18:50.389 --> 00:18:52.050]  So this has even touched my life!
[00:18:54.012 --> 00:18:56.514]  That was, I don't know, was that about 87 or something?
[00:18:58.396 --> 00:19:01.118]  So, 86, 87, yeah.
[00:19:01.759 --> 00:19:03.560]  So, this is the type of stuff going on.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.482]  Would you like to see what's in those laboratories?
[00:19:05.742 --> 00:19:13.309]  We've had the top scientist on this show, of course they can't talk about it, they can only talk generally about it because of national security.
[00:19:14.918 --> 00:19:20.000]  But their word for it is horrors beyond your imagination.
[00:19:25.082 --> 00:19:29.804]  Horrors beyond your imagination.
[00:19:29.884 --> 00:19:31.265]  Remember Dr. Deagle a few weeks ago?
[00:19:31.285 --> 00:19:32.125]  We've got to get him back on.
[00:19:32.365 --> 00:19:34.626]  We've got to post that audio and get a transcript of that.
[00:19:37.947 --> 00:19:42.069]  So we'll come back and we'll get some more into some of the cloning horrors.
[00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:44.980]  And your calls and a bunch of other news.
[00:19:45.861 --> 00:19:47.942]  Oh, there's so much of it for you today.
[00:19:47.962 --> 00:19:51.283]  Infowars.com, check it out.
[00:19:51.303 --> 00:19:54.005]  A lot of new stuff posted at ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:19:54.025 --> 00:19:58.067]  And don't forget, PrisonPlanet.tv, our subscription service.
[00:19:58.507 --> 00:19:58.927]  We'll be back.
[00:20:03.692 --> 00:20:09.177]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:09.598 --> 00:20:13.842]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:20:14.062 --> 00:20:21.109]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:20:21.489 --> 00:20:27.595]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:20:27.735 --> 00:20:28.956]  There are no side effects.
[00:20:29.276 --> 00:20:32.240]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:34.423]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:20:34.724 --> 00:20:41.954]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:20:42.254 --> 00:20:45.639]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:21:03.008 --> 00:21:08.732]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:08.992 --> 00:21:14.135]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:14.475 --> 00:21:16.917]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove
[00:21:17.017 --> 00:21:17.537]  We're good to go!
[00:21:38.724 --> 00:21:44.708]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:21:51.251 --> 00:21:52.232]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:52.292 --> 00:21:53.493]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:01.914 --> 00:22:06.459]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glasser, a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:22:06.579 --> 00:22:07.820]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.561]  Thank you, Marvin.
[00:22:08.761 --> 00:22:12.124]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[00:22:12.284 --> 00:22:12.825]  Is that true?
[00:22:13.045 --> 00:22:14.026]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[00:22:14.046 --> 00:22:17.029]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[00:22:17.109 --> 00:22:17.369]  price.
[00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.632]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:20.412]  They're very common.
[00:22:20.513 --> 00:22:23.696]  Those common drugs, you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[00:22:23.736 --> 00:22:23.976]  price.
[00:22:24.216 --> 00:22:25.397]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[00:22:25.417 --> 00:22:27.840]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:32.164]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular US price.
[00:22:32.524 --> 00:22:34.907]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:39.251]  Yes, the same multinational US corporation makes them in Canada and the US.
[00:22:39.511 --> 00:22:44.457]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.

[00:22:46.679 --> 00:22:47.080]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.481]  Or go on the web at www.canshipdrugs.com.
[00:23:01.377 --> 00:23:02.857]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[00:23:03.157 --> 00:23:07.739]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:10.419]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:12.160]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.621]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:23:17.961 --> 00:23:19.181]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[00:23:19.221 --> 00:23:21.922]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:23:22.322 --> 00:23:29.368]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:23:29.748 --> 00:23:32.951]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.

[00:23:36.254 --> 00:23:41.378]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[00:23:41.878 --> 00:23:48.503]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that Silver Dollar for only $22.95.
[00:23:48.783 --> 00:23:49.444]  Get the map.
[00:23:49.464 --> 00:23:51.865]  Start your journey to financial independence today.
[00:23:52.085 --> 00:23:53.066]  The time is now.
[00:23:53.426 --> 00:23:56.128]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:56.308 --> 00:23:59.431]  Get your Red Book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:16.184]  Alright, Jake and Cosra and others, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:32.758]  Continuing with cloning, I mean, what type of humanity do we have when five years ago, big biotech was saying, yeah, we're going to industrialize embryo farms, growing them in cows, in bovine.
[00:24:36.181 --> 00:24:37.562]  And we're just going to do all this.
[00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:40.084]  And then again, the average person doesn't even know what's going on.
[00:24:40.184 --> 00:24:42.105]  But now it's being told to them.
[00:24:42.946 --> 00:24:50.011]  The National Academy of Sciences, which advises the federal government, has been studying the issue and hopes to make recommendations by February.
[00:24:50.771 --> 00:24:53.393]  So for decades they've been doing it, now they're going to make some recommendations.
[00:24:53.793 --> 00:25:03.600]  We need to establish some kind of guidelines as to the scientific community ought to do and ought not to do, said James Batty, chairman of the National Institutes of Health
[00:25:04.278 --> 00:25:05.759]  Stem Cell Task Force.
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:17.604]  Chimeras, or Chimeras, pronounced Chi-me-ras, meaning mixtures of two or more individuals in a single body, are not inherently unnatural.
[00:25:18.725 --> 00:25:20.366]  That's a really sick way of putting it.
[00:25:20.766 --> 00:25:30.371]  Most twins carry at least a few cells from the sibling in whom they shared the womb, and most mothers carry their blood at least a few cells from each baby they have born.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.380]  Alright, let me just give you the facts.
[00:25:35.241 --> 00:25:44.704]  Most people, like David Bowie, you see that have a blue eye and a gray eye or a blue eye and a brown eye, they are a chimera.
[00:25:46.765 --> 00:25:47.925]  They are a chimera.
[00:25:48.425 --> 00:25:49.085]  That's just a fact.
[00:25:49.105 --> 00:25:56.428]  You see a dog with two different color eyes, unless it's a specific breed that has that, they are a chimera.
[00:25:57.328 --> 00:26:02.610]  And what happened is, they are a fraternal twin that did not divide.
[00:26:05.075 --> 00:26:07.157]  And that's just scientific fact.
[00:26:07.197 --> 00:26:10.540]  There are thousands of chimeras in the United States.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.662]  So, in that respect, they are natural.
[00:26:14.343 --> 00:26:20.628]  But folks, it's not naturally occurring to put pig genes and spider genes into a human.
[00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:26.313]  It's not natural to put cockroach genes into the major delicious tomatoes you enjoy.
[00:26:28.555 --> 00:26:31.177]  It is not natural to put salmon genes into corn.
[00:26:32.558 --> 00:26:34.079]  It is not natural.
[00:26:34.099 --> 00:26:34.759]  Let me say it again.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.241]  So, no, that's not natural.
[00:26:38.742 --> 00:26:40.623]  There are freaks of genetics.
[00:26:41.783 --> 00:26:43.004]  There are chimeras.
[00:26:44.345 --> 00:26:47.367]  But to call twins chimeras really isn't correct.
[00:26:48.347 --> 00:26:52.109]  Because they've got a few of each other's cells that didn't divide properly.
[00:26:52.910 --> 00:27:02.075]  A true chimera, because I've looked into this years ago, is literally, and the person looks very similar on each side of their face,
[00:27:03.144 --> 00:27:05.786]  And, uh, they generally have higher than normal intelligence.
[00:27:06.687 --> 00:27:14.094]  And, I mean, really, the way we're designed with left and right brain, already those are two different structures, so they usually don't even have any mental problems or mental deficiencies.
[00:27:15.815 --> 00:27:16.496]  And they're out there.
[00:27:17.937 --> 00:27:21.160]  Uh, David Bowie clearly is a chimera.
[00:27:22.221 --> 00:27:24.683]  Two different color eyes.
[00:27:25.849 --> 00:27:27.029]  Is the main sign.
[00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.051]  Generally, if someone has that, they are a chimera.
[00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:36.072]  But it is not natural to have pigs that are almost completely human.
[00:27:36.112 --> 00:27:38.993]  Their organs, their eyes, their skin.
[00:27:39.633 --> 00:27:40.613]  This is sick, folks.
[00:27:41.974 --> 00:27:45.615]  I remember six, seven years ago, eight years ago, I learned of spider goats.
[00:27:45.655 --> 00:27:48.296]  Then five years ago, we got photos of it.
[00:27:49.616 --> 00:27:52.497]  And every time I mention it, I get an email going, you're a complete lunatic.
[00:27:53.757 --> 00:27:56.519]  Just type SpiderGoats in, CBS, NBC, you name it.
[00:27:56.879 --> 00:28:04.285]  I've had the CEO of the biggest SpiderGoat farm, the patentee, they have the patents on some of the most successful SpiderGoats.
[00:28:04.826 --> 00:28:14.073]  They're in upstate New York, outside of Rochester, and turned out he was a listener, too.
[00:28:14.093 --> 00:28:15.033]  He's got an affiliate up there.
[00:28:15.053 --> 00:28:16.775]  He's like, oh Alex, glad to come on, yes.
[00:28:17.655 --> 00:28:21.458]  And it's out there at an old army base, and they have troops guarding them, and high fences around it.
[00:28:21.859 --> 00:28:23.520]  Because if those goats get out, you've got a problem.
[00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.912]  And their udders are spider spinnerets.
[00:28:28.233 --> 00:28:33.816]  And their udders create giant globs of spider filament.
[00:28:34.997 --> 00:28:37.898]  And they use it for body armor and other classified things.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.741]  And they milk the little goaties.
[00:28:44.722 --> 00:28:45.763]  These spider goats.
[00:28:45.943 --> 00:28:46.604]  And this happens.
[00:28:46.944 --> 00:28:48.505]  And again, I know you don't want to believe it.
[00:28:48.545 --> 00:28:50.806]  Just like you don't want to believe the announcement of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:28:50.826 --> 00:28:53.668]  They're going to stick a satellite tracker box in your car and attach you
[00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:57.161]  Six dollars a gallon.
[00:29:01.003 --> 00:29:02.704]  Yes, folks, I'm not joking.
[00:29:06.167 --> 00:29:07.267]  I know you don't want to believe it.
[00:29:07.808 --> 00:29:09.629]  And you don't want to believe your dollar plunged again.
[00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:10.009]  I know.
[00:29:10.229 --> 00:29:10.509]  Again.
[00:29:10.569 --> 00:29:10.830]  I know.
[00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:11.390]  I understand.
[00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.992]  You don't want to believe that sodium fluoride is deadly for you.
[00:29:14.032 --> 00:29:15.853]  You don't want to believe that you don't have to take vaccines.
[00:29:15.893 --> 00:29:16.533]  There's no law.
[00:29:17.274 --> 00:29:19.535]  You don't want to believe that depleting uranium is bad for the troops.
[00:29:19.555 --> 00:29:20.496]  It's just easier
[00:29:21.266 --> 00:29:25.707]  That any threat to your world view, you just deny exists and it'll go away.
[00:29:26.908 --> 00:29:28.528]  But it's not going to go away.
[00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:39.472]  We'll come back, take calls, get more into cloning, get into a plane coming to pick up the former president, George Herbert Walker.
[00:29:40.552 --> 00:29:42.853]  Mysteriously crashed yesterday in Houston.
[00:29:44.714 --> 00:29:45.734]  A lot of stuff coming up.
[00:29:46.774 --> 00:29:47.534]  You don't want to miss it.
[00:29:47.574 --> 00:29:48.595]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:48.735 --> 00:29:49.135]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:54.603]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.504 --> 00:29:58.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.323 --> 00:30:04.905]  Every hour of every day, someone out there is suffering from hemorrhoids.
[00:30:05.205 --> 00:30:07.706]  The pain, worry, and embarrassment can be devastating.

[00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.452]  My husband had been suffering from a painful hemorrhoid for years.
[00:30:19.832 --> 00:30:22.513]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[00:30:22.873 --> 00:30:26.615]  I ordered Hemtab online, and soon after taking Hemtab, the pain was gone.
[00:30:26.635 --> 00:30:28.776]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[00:30:29.076 --> 00:30:29.536]  Miracle?
[00:30:29.756 --> 00:30:30.917]  Hem Miracle, we call it.
[00:30:31.137 --> 00:30:31.897]  Thanks, Hemtab!

[00:31:01.185 --> 00:31:07.428]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.548 --> 00:31:13.730]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:22.374]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:22.674 --> 00:31:25.217]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter.
[00:31:25.357 --> 00:31:29.721]  And during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.002 --> 00:31:34.847]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.047 --> 00:31:40.452]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:40.813 --> 00:31:43.856]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight or nightlight.

[00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:03.191]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:32:03.392 --> 00:32:10.738]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:32:11.058 --> 00:32:15.462]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:32:15.742 --> 00:32:25.571]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:32:26.332 --> 00:32:29.976]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:32:30.316 --> 00:32:32.799]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:32:32.819 --> 00:32:39.046]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:32:39.286 --> 00:32:40.828]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:32:41.108 --> 00:32:41.989]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:32:42.069 --> 00:32:45.051]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:46.132]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:32:46.172 --> 00:32:46.352]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:32:46.412 --> 00:32:49.495]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[00:32:49.515 --> 00:32:50.456]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:33:06.292 --> 00:33:08.213]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.673 --> 00:33:11.534]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.597 --> 00:33:35.545]  Scientists globally, just in a pell-mell, helter-skelter, wild dash off the edge of the cliff, have been crossing human genes with bacteria, viruses, putting them into the open environment, live-age virus grown into pharmacological corn, crossing humans with pigs,
[00:33:37.498 --> 00:33:41.262]  Everything else you can imagine, and now it's finally all over mainstream media.
[00:33:43.964 --> 00:34:02.041]  But, it says, uh, chemistry becomes a more sensitive topic when it involves growing entire human organs inside animals, and it becomes especially sensitive when it deals in brain cells, the building blocks of the origin and organs created with making humans
[00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:04.175]  And then there's other articles here.
[00:34:04.515 --> 00:34:08.519]  Scientists for years have added human genes to bacteria and farm animals.
[00:34:08.979 --> 00:34:16.004]  Feats of genetic engineering that allow those critters to make human proteins such as insulin for use as medicines.
[00:34:17.185 --> 00:34:19.487]  So see now, it's just all out in the open.
[00:34:20.107 --> 00:34:26.112]  Washington Post, Associated Press, ABC News.
[00:34:27.773 --> 00:34:29.555]  We'll be going more over these articles.
[00:34:30.723 --> 00:34:34.525]  I just got word that it is confirmed, it's been diagnosed.
[00:34:35.745 --> 00:34:45.269]  ArnoldExposed.com, since we launched it Thursday, has been under continual, sustained, massive attack.
[00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:50.071]  And I'm trying to get our IT guy on to talk about it, because this is news in and of itself.
[00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:53.392]  You know I don't just get on the air every day when we're getting a lot of traffic and go, oh, we're being attacked.
[00:34:53.753 --> 00:34:57.574]  We're being specifically attacked with very sophisticated measures.
[00:34:58.134 --> 00:34:59.595]  But our servers are humongous.
[00:35:01.019 --> 00:35:06.782]  And sophisticated themselves, and so people are still able to get on ArnoldExposed.com most of the time.
[00:35:07.683 --> 00:35:10.404]  And so we're just going to add a server farm to it.
[00:35:11.205 --> 00:35:12.306]  Relayed servers.
[00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:14.807]  And I'm sure there will be more attacks.
[00:35:14.827 --> 00:35:17.128]  We'll have to grow and roll with the punches.
[00:35:17.909 --> 00:35:20.070]  When you're over the target, you get the flack, folks.
[00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:25.793]  When you're over Berlin, you know, 1943, you know when you go over Berlin.
[00:35:25.813 --> 00:35:29.035]  Pun intended, you get the flack.
[00:35:30.234 --> 00:35:31.955]  And so we're under heavy bombardment.
[00:35:31.995 --> 00:35:34.417]  Just email all your friends and family.
[00:35:35.317 --> 00:35:37.419]  And tell everybody about ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:35:37.439 --> 00:35:38.840]  That's how we handle things here.
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.622]  That's how we handle this.
[00:35:41.662 --> 00:35:44.483]  We just increase our firepower in the Info War.
[00:35:44.503 --> 00:35:49.527]  So we're launching more capital ships in the Info War.
[00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.889]  That's what our servers and our websites are.
[00:35:52.909 --> 00:35:53.930]  That's why we have so many.
[00:35:55.171 --> 00:35:57.532]  Launching new ones now on a monthly basis.
[00:35:57.772 --> 00:35:58.733]  The battle continues.
[00:36:03.602 --> 00:36:05.823]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jake in Arizona.
[00:36:05.883 --> 00:36:06.744]  Jake, you're on the air.
[00:36:06.804 --> 00:36:07.284]  Go ahead.
[00:36:07.544 --> 00:36:08.564]  Hey, this is Alex.
[00:36:08.584 --> 00:36:09.065]  How's it going?
[00:36:09.285 --> 00:36:09.685]  Welcome.
[00:36:09.885 --> 00:36:10.765]  I'm doing fine, sir.
[00:36:10.926 --> 00:36:11.966]  Yeah, I got a question.
[00:36:12.466 --> 00:36:14.447]  Well, actually, more of a comment.
[00:36:14.947 --> 00:36:24.112]  The Brief Analysis of the Domestic Security Enhancement Act, I read your article on it, and I was thinking, much like you're doing with ArticleExposed.com,
[00:36:25.414 --> 00:36:34.138]  Uh, maybe some, you can get some donations and start, uh, doing the, um, maybe some radio spots and, uh, just telling people what it's about.
[00:36:34.718 --> 00:36:35.959]  Uh, things like that.
[00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:38.260]  Maybe, maybe a couple, uh, TV commercials.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.281]  Uh... Well, Patriot Act 2...
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.141]  Introduced in January of 2003.
[00:36:43.221 --> 00:36:45.763]  Almost passed this weekend.
[00:36:46.164 --> 00:36:48.425]  It did not pass in the 9-11 package.
[00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:52.669]  That's why they're going to have an emergency session sometime in December.
[00:36:52.749 --> 00:37:04.859]  We did confirm with Ron Paul's office yesterday, and we've written a little blurb on this, that the new Freedom Initiative, the forced psychological testing, even if you're homeschooled or private schooled, that did indeed pass.
[00:37:06.089 --> 00:37:11.434]  Because I think it'd be a good idea, I mean, just kind of nip it in the bud before they can even pass it.
[00:37:11.474 --> 00:37:13.115]  Let everybody know on a mass scale.
[00:37:13.475 --> 00:37:16.498]  Because, like you said, the average person doesn't know about it.
[00:37:16.598 --> 00:37:20.441]  I mention it to friends and family and just people who I meet, you know, at random.
[00:37:20.742 --> 00:37:26.186]  Because I see over 200 people a day at my job, and politics is a major topic.
[00:37:26.246 --> 00:37:27.627]  Well, they don't have any excuse.
[00:37:27.667 --> 00:37:29.369]  They're obviously not reading the newspaper.
[00:37:29.389 --> 00:37:31.871]  Patriot Act 2 has been reported on.
[00:37:33.456 --> 00:37:36.319]  Okay, well, you know, it was just a comment or a suggestion.
[00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:38.281]  Oh, no, listen, I wish we could do it all.
[00:37:38.801 --> 00:37:40.603]  I mean, we have fought the Patriot Act.
[00:37:40.823 --> 00:37:56.138]  I thought up the idea over two years ago to start a national, state-by-state, city-by-city movement to repeal Patriot Acts locally, and that was picked up on by other great folks, and they ran with it.
[00:37:58.722 --> 00:38:01.205]  I know there's millionaires and millionaires listening right now.
[00:38:01.666 --> 00:38:05.170]  What's to stop them from going and picking up the ball and doing it themselves?
[00:38:05.851 --> 00:38:11.437]  What's to stop all of you from starting your own websites and locally trying to repeal this stuff?
[00:38:12.779 --> 00:38:15.002]  It's all of us, lots of targets.
[00:38:15.562 --> 00:38:16.503]  More people.
[00:38:16.963 --> 00:38:19.706]  We don't want a centralized command structure.
[00:38:20.206 --> 00:38:27.272]  We want lots of independent operators defending the Republic in a guerrilla info war capacity.
[00:38:27.292 --> 00:38:30.815]  Do you know what special forces do?
[00:38:30.835 --> 00:38:31.656]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:31.716 --> 00:38:33.718]  Have you heard of force multiplication?
[00:38:34.078 --> 00:38:34.979]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:34.999 --> 00:38:36.000]  Force multipliers?
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.181]  Alright, tell folks about those.
[00:38:41.553 --> 00:38:42.814]  Well, thanks for the call.
[00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:44.675]  Great call, great idea.
[00:38:46.256 --> 00:38:47.537]  I wanted to get your take on it.
[00:38:48.918 --> 00:39:01.066]  A force multiplier is just a term for anything where you use a little bit of energy that causes a chain reaction and a bigger effect down the line that then hits geometric growth proportions.
[00:39:01.606 --> 00:39:03.768]  A geometric growth curve signature.
[00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:05.529]  Or wave.
[00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.572]  And special forces, you put four guys in,
[00:39:10.464 --> 00:39:19.809]  To say a mountain area with a particular Indian tribe or native tribe that let's say is against the North Vietnamese or the Viet Cong irregulars.
[00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:30.496]  And you train them and take their native skills and force multiply to train them to train others who then train others.
[00:39:32.377 --> 00:39:34.498]  Or you could just simplify it to grassroots.
[00:39:36.989 --> 00:39:38.730]  And if we don't do that, it's over.
[00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:44.393]  Now, we have done that, and 38-45% of the media has had their viewers leave them completely.
[00:39:45.013 --> 00:39:46.774]  They've all gone to alternative media.
[00:39:47.354 --> 00:39:49.475]  The globalists are panicking and losing control.
[00:39:49.955 --> 00:39:54.237]  Take the Arnold, uh, the president crowd, the amend for Arnold.
[00:39:54.257 --> 00:39:56.519]  They've only had 4 million hits in a week.
[00:39:58.319 --> 00:40:00.761]  And last time I checked, we had over 3 million in 3 days.
[00:40:02.412 --> 00:40:10.914]  They've been on every major TV show, every big morning show, on CNN five, six times, wall-to-wall coverage, hundreds of newspapers.
[00:40:11.214 --> 00:40:16.615]  We've been on CNN, little blurb, and in the Associated Press, that's a small portion of The Hitch.
[00:40:17.115 --> 00:40:30.698]  The Hitch have come from you spreading the word, the SEED group, the hundreds of thousands of my millions of listeners that took action, and then you told others and they told others, and I'm sure we're well past them now, I haven't checked it in a few days.
[00:40:33.411 --> 00:40:36.112]  So, see, that's how an Infowar operates.
[00:40:36.792 --> 00:40:48.156]  All they can do is continually, desperately try to marginalize us and ignore what we're doing, and whoever's launching, and it looks governmental, launch these attacks on ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:40:50.677 --> 00:40:52.258]  And if anything ever happens to me,
[00:40:53.627 --> 00:40:57.892]  Why all of you launch ArnoldExposed.com websites with similar names.
[00:40:58.292 --> 00:41:10.266]  In fact, I suggest all of you who are web-savvy create clones of ArnoldExposed.com and then build on them kind of a internet chimera and add other information.
[00:41:10.306 --> 00:41:12.028]  I'm sure you can do a better job than we've done, many of you.
[00:41:12.828 --> 00:41:13.609]  So, launch it.
[00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:14.450]  Launch it now.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:16.240]  Take action.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.841]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:41:18.081 --> 00:41:18.561]  Commence.
[00:41:18.861 --> 00:41:19.922]  Set a goal of two days.
[00:41:20.082 --> 00:41:23.503]  Within two days, have your own Arnold exposed websites launched.
[00:41:24.184 --> 00:41:25.504]  Battle, battle, battle, battle.
[00:41:25.564 --> 00:41:26.505]  Launch, launch, launch.
[00:41:26.705 --> 00:41:27.345]  Never stop.
[00:41:27.425 --> 00:41:28.065]  Never waver.
[00:41:28.326 --> 00:41:30.587]  Never quit going forward in defense of the Republic.
[00:41:30.787 --> 00:41:31.427]  Never stop.
[00:41:31.487 --> 00:41:32.087]  Never stop.
[00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:32.828]  Never stop.
[00:41:33.268 --> 00:41:36.849]  Let's go to Cosra in Florida.
[00:41:36.869 --> 00:41:38.570]  You're on the air, worldwide.
[00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.171]  Hey, how you doing, Mr. Jones?
[00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:40.551]  Good.
[00:41:41.072 --> 00:41:41.352]  Good.
[00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:44.655]  Well, I didn't expect for you to be such a fiery person.
[00:41:44.715 --> 00:41:53.721]  Actually, I had a couple of initial questions, but after listening to the information you were putting out about the splicing of vegetables, you kind of made me forget what I was going to say.
[00:41:53.781 --> 00:42:00.807]  But, in terms of reduplicating what you're doing out there, I'm an African American.
[00:42:01.527 --> 00:42:05.230]  Most African Americans that I come across have no idea what the hell you're talking about.
[00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:09.746]  And I want to know, how can I help to spread this word?
[00:42:09.766 --> 00:42:12.588]  I mean, you have some information on Planet TV.
[00:42:12.808 --> 00:42:17.011]  Are those actually DVDs, or you just have access to that online?
[00:42:17.051 --> 00:42:25.717]  For 15 cents a day, you get all 11 of my full-length feature films in high bandwidth or low bandwidth streams, depending on what type of connection you've got.
[00:42:26.078 --> 00:42:28.179]  You get my book, you can print it off by the way, 220 pages.
[00:42:28.199 --> 00:42:29.120]  Paul Watson's book, 320-something pages.
[00:42:32.532 --> 00:42:38.252]  Two books, eleven films, fifty plus TV reports I've done, hundreds of audio interviews.
[00:42:38.453 --> 00:42:38.674]  Okay.
[00:42:39.674 --> 00:42:45.117]  Cash reports for 15 cents a day, but you can download them and burn them on the CDs if you want.
[00:42:45.737 --> 00:42:56.222]  You can give gifts of subscriptions to friends and family, or you can buy hard copy VHS or DVDs of my films or other films I carry off the secure online shopping cart.
[00:42:56.523 --> 00:42:57.483]  You can do both, sir.
[00:42:57.923 --> 00:43:09.189]  And I would tell you this, as an American who just happens to have more melanin in his skin than I, I would just get past black, white, or whatever group, and I would get to the point
[00:43:09.629 --> 00:43:11.571]  The Jewish leaders are corrupt and controlled.
[00:43:11.811 --> 00:43:14.092]  The black leaders are corrupt and controlled by and large.
[00:43:14.493 --> 00:43:16.734]  The so-called white leaders are corrupt and controlled.
[00:43:16.954 --> 00:43:19.236]  The so-called Hispanic leaders are corrupt and controlled.
[00:43:19.937 --> 00:43:24.440]  And the biggest problem the black community has is your leaders have been bought and paid for.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.822]  And they tell you some of the truth, but not the real deal.
[00:43:28.523 --> 00:43:31.665]  Then they marginalize any true black leader that tries to lead.
[00:43:32.525 --> 00:43:34.487]  And so I would tell you, be a leader.
[00:43:35.527 --> 00:43:35.747]  Right.
[00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:42.430]  The only problem is that in the African-American community, they seem to be locked into certain forms of media.
[00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:48.052]  I know the general public is as well, but the black community... Don't worry about problems.
[00:43:48.572 --> 00:43:49.232]  Ignore that.
[00:43:49.592 --> 00:43:50.793]  Make your own media, sir.
[00:43:51.853 --> 00:43:53.294]  Go out and get two or three sponsors.
[00:43:53.314 --> 00:43:54.254]  You sound articulate.
[00:43:54.594 --> 00:43:57.315]  Go buy time two hours a night on, say, Saturday night.
[00:43:57.335 --> 00:43:58.576]  A couple hundred bucks.
[00:43:58.616 --> 00:43:59.456]  Get a few sponsors.
[00:43:59.496 --> 00:44:00.777]  You can make a little money, which is good.
[00:44:00.817 --> 00:44:01.657]  We're a free market.
[00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:09.573]  Uh, start a website, do that show for a year, get tens of thousands of listeners, and use that as a political force in your area.
[00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:11.914]  There, there's a battle plan that will work.
[00:44:13.515 --> 00:44:22.399]  Okay, now let me ask you, how do you keep, I mean, some of the information you, most people just talk about what they, you know, quote unquote, they are doing, but you name a lot of the names.
[00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:24.220]  How do you keep these guys off of you?
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.302]  I mean, I know you have to be up under constant bombardment.
[00:44:29.517 --> 00:44:30.038]  Not really.
[00:44:30.098 --> 00:44:35.505]  I mean, I've gotten death threats before, and we get hacked occasionally, or they try to, and there's too many of us, sir.
[00:44:35.545 --> 00:44:39.610]  There's thousands of us who are prominent, who are fighting, and I just don't care.
[00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:40.972]  Look, it's simple.
[00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:45.978]  If my neighbor's house is burning, and they're passed out from the smoke,
[00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:48.198]  There's no question of it.
[00:44:48.238 --> 00:44:51.540]  If I've got any chance to get in and save them, I'm not going to wait for the firefighters.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.660]  I'm going to go in.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.821]  Not because I'm a hero.
[00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:59.784]  My instinctive need is to defend life because my brain hasn't been deprogrammed.
[00:45:00.244 --> 00:45:04.527]  It has the proper original coding that it understands.
[00:45:04.647 --> 00:45:10.070]  My instincts understand that if I don't worry about my neighbor, they're not going to worry about me.
[00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.330]  And then I'm in a hell on earth.
[00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:12.371]  I have a tribal
[00:45:13.469 --> 00:45:15.410]  Encoding.
[00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:17.471]  I'm in my natural state.
[00:45:17.852 --> 00:45:19.132]  I haven't been domesticated.
[00:45:19.973 --> 00:45:23.935]  And so, on the mass scale, if I see a threat to humanity, I'm going to fight it.
[00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:25.796]  And so, I don't care.
[00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:30.599]  I don't care if I walk out of my studio today and the globalists shoot me five times in the heart.
[00:45:31.339 --> 00:45:37.022]  I don't care if I go to a restaurant and they poison me and I drop dead from cyanide five minutes later.
[00:45:37.382 --> 00:45:38.543]  I will die smiling.
[00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:40.970]  Because I've already won.
[00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:44.271]  I've already decided that I'm willing to lay down my life for my brother.
[00:45:44.811 --> 00:45:47.432]  And if we have that attitude, we'll be free and prosperous.
[00:45:47.712 --> 00:45:54.614]  Because I know, my instincts know, but then my intellect also knows, that when you aren't willing to lay your life down, you're a slave.
[00:45:54.895 --> 00:45:59.536]  When you aren't willing to fight and be ridiculed and be attacked, you're already a slave.
[00:45:59.736 --> 00:46:00.877]  You're already in bondage.
[00:46:00.917 --> 00:46:02.357]  That ensures bondage.
[00:46:02.617 --> 00:46:07.379]  You see, the path towards freedom looks like it's dangerous, but it's actually the safest course.
[00:46:08.044 --> 00:46:16.569]  The course of going along with what the general media says, and not rocking the boat, is the course of stagnation, enslavement, and dehumanization.
[00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:17.250]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:18.931 --> 00:46:20.291]  And so there is no question.
[00:46:20.432 --> 00:46:23.734]  There is no... There's not even a question!
[00:46:25.555 --> 00:46:26.735]  There's not even a debate!
[00:46:29.237 --> 00:46:30.318]  Get past your fear.
[00:46:30.418 --> 00:46:32.359]  Let it go through you, around you.
[00:46:32.439 --> 00:46:32.979]  Ignore it.
[00:46:35.261 --> 00:46:37.462]  Make it... Make it warm your heart.
[00:46:39.116 --> 00:46:41.297]  And then one day, it'll just disappear.
[00:46:42.718 --> 00:46:49.903]  And after each test you go through, after each time you don't let weak-minded people influence you, you become stronger.
[00:46:50.623 --> 00:46:54.426]  And you stand out from the crowd of sheep who want to be slaves.
[00:46:56.707 --> 00:46:58.808]  Let's talk to Emmett in Pennsylvania.
[00:46:58.868 --> 00:46:59.549]  Emmett, go ahead.
[00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:01.750]  Yes, go Eagles.
[00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.432]  It's the only decent thing to watch on TV is football.
[00:47:08.857 --> 00:47:12.238]  Tuesday's CSI program.
[00:47:12.278 --> 00:47:13.519]  Did you happen to see that?
[00:47:14.859 --> 00:47:17.080]  One episode, put the chips in everybody, it's good.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:21.042]  Next episode, arrest people for pot dealing because they're terrorists.
[00:47:21.482 --> 00:47:22.722]  No, I don't watch it.
[00:47:22.742 --> 00:47:24.543]  I read the summations of what it was about.
[00:47:24.783 --> 00:47:34.607]  Well, a friend of mine told me to watch it because, and I normally don't, but anyway, it was about men being converted into women.
[00:47:36.207 --> 00:47:36.948]  And they even had
[00:47:38.536 --> 00:47:45.237]  Warnings, even halfway through the program a warning about not letting children see it.
[00:47:45.858 --> 00:47:48.998]  They were sitting there with the falsies right out.
[00:47:49.298 --> 00:47:54.239]  I mean, it was all, how low is TV gonna get?
[00:47:54.319 --> 00:47:56.360]  What you're saying, people were naked on television?
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.720]  Yes, uh-huh.
[00:47:59.101 --> 00:48:03.381]  But it wasn't a real breast, it was a falsie, you know, but still.
[00:48:04.682 --> 00:48:05.602]  What's the next step?
[00:48:06.815 --> 00:48:13.600]  Well, look, you can track television and the violence on it with the increase in violence in the United States.
[00:48:14.061 --> 00:48:15.842]  That's called programming for a reason.
[00:48:16.803 --> 00:48:20.786]  And I suggest that you not let your children watch it.
[00:48:21.547 --> 00:48:22.868]  I suggest you put it away.
[00:48:23.608 --> 00:48:24.409]  Go for a walk.
[00:48:24.449 --> 00:48:25.270]  Go for a hike.
[00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:27.511]  Go work in the garden.
[00:48:27.912 --> 00:48:29.113]  Go hang out with your neighbors.
[00:48:29.173 --> 00:48:31.314]  Go join a softball team.
[00:48:32.535 --> 00:48:33.316]  Do anything!
[00:48:33.917 --> 00:48:34.197]  Right.
[00:48:34.377 --> 00:48:36.118]  Don't watch television, sir.
[00:48:36.318 --> 00:48:36.658]  I don't.
[00:48:37.279 --> 00:48:40.980]  I watch it maybe an hour a week and it's sheer torture.
[00:48:42.261 --> 00:48:43.642]  We don't watch it in my home.
[00:48:46.783 --> 00:48:47.764]  And that's just the end of it.
[00:48:48.324 --> 00:48:48.584]  Right.
[00:48:48.744 --> 00:48:50.085]  I mean, you let yourself watch that.
[00:48:50.665 --> 00:48:53.947]  I mean, I have a television to watch DVDs and films on.
[00:48:54.527 --> 00:48:56.028]  And I choose what I want to watch.
[00:48:57.008 --> 00:48:58.269]  So, let me rephrase that.
[00:48:58.329 --> 00:48:59.749]  I probably watch two hours.
[00:48:59.809 --> 00:49:02.491]  I watch probably one movie a week for R&R.
[00:49:04.222 --> 00:49:07.303]  And I probably watch one hour of television a week.
[00:49:08.704 --> 00:49:10.465]  The average American watches four hours a week.
[00:49:10.485 --> 00:49:11.685]  Thanks for the call.
[00:49:11.945 --> 00:49:26.331]  Okay, finish up, sir, because talking about the Eagles and... Is it also true that Arnold... There's another word they're using for his name, Schwarzenegger, appeared on the front cover of a gay magazine?
[00:49:27.111 --> 00:49:27.331]  Yes.
[00:49:30.569 --> 00:49:32.190]  Okay, thank you.
[00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:34.971]  Yeah, we've got the publications.
[00:49:36.192 --> 00:49:41.435]  That is, we've got the online and it hasn't been denied, and we have a link to it.
[00:49:41.875 --> 00:49:43.096]  I've been thinking about doing that.
[00:49:43.316 --> 00:49:44.817]  I mean, it's not hard to find.
[00:49:44.877 --> 00:49:45.958]  I mean, there's a whole bunch of them.
[00:49:46.738 --> 00:49:50.600]  And then he's in the private collection of Robert Mapplethorpe, it's been reported.
[00:49:51.901 --> 00:49:58.965]  Robert Mapplethorpe, who did things we can't mention here, but in some of his other photos he did of other people and himself.
[00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:02.971]  But he's Christian and conservative.
[00:50:02.991 --> 00:50:07.113]  He just says that he despises people that worship Jesus Christ.
[00:50:08.394 --> 00:50:10.856]  And said, people need somebody to watch over them.
[00:50:10.876 --> 00:50:14.718]  95% of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[00:50:15.799 --> 00:50:18.360]  My relationship to power and authority is that I'm all for it.
[00:50:19.421 --> 00:50:21.442]  He said that when he was 44 years old.
[00:50:23.443 --> 00:50:28.186]  And I'm getting emails and calls that he said he wanted to be king of the earth on California TV a few months ago.
[00:50:28.746 --> 00:50:31.048]  I haven't confirmed that, but we do have him in other interviews.
[00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:39.233]  Saying he wants to be king of the earth and rule you and doesn't think you should be able to own guns.
[00:50:40.314 --> 00:50:41.574]  So the Republicans love him.
[00:50:46.617 --> 00:50:49.918]  But look, they're trying to act like everybody loves him.
[00:50:49.938 --> 00:50:50.319]  They don't.
[00:50:51.519 --> 00:50:54.501]  Everybody I've talked to in California is against him, but the news says how great he is.
[00:50:54.941 --> 00:50:57.142]  Well come back, cover more news, take your calls, stay with us.
[00:50:57.162 --> 00:50:59.183]  PrisonPlanet.tv, check it out.
[00:51:01.286 --> 00:51:08.148]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.448 --> 00:51:09.828]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.008 --> 00:51:12.229]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:14.449]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:19.671]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.011 --> 00:51:24.032]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.292 --> 00:51:26.073]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.133 --> 00:51:36.799]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.841]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:54:03.792 --> 00:54:09.835]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.435 --> 00:54:13.396]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:14.577 --> 00:54:27.783]  Before I go to Ron and Ali and Enoch and Jehoshaphat and everybody else,
[00:54:29.884 --> 00:54:33.747]  The toll-free number to join us on-air is 1-800-255-99231.
[00:54:33.767 --> 00:54:40.351]  One of the biggest solutions we have to the fight against the New World Order, frankly, is information.
[00:54:40.451 --> 00:54:42.373]  And my documentary films are among the best.
[00:54:43.774 --> 00:54:55.602]  American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004, showed you how Kerry was going to take a dive, how he was skill and bones, Bush's cousin, how he's for all the exact same policies, just different rhetoric.
[00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:58.209]  We go back to Bohemian Grove.
[00:54:58.249 --> 00:54:59.209]  We cover all that stuff.
[00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:01.310]  We get into 9-11 information.
[00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:11.272]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order the hard copies of the films off the secure online shopping cart.
[00:55:12.732 --> 00:55:13.712]  Or call toll free.
[00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:16.053]  Bunch of different discounts.
[00:55:16.453 --> 00:55:18.053]  70% off of some of the titles.
[00:55:19.093 --> 00:55:19.333]  Actually, 75%.
[00:55:19.373 --> 00:55:20.693]  Actually, more than that.
[00:55:26.007 --> 00:55:30.988]  Let me see, if something that's normally $25.95 is $5.95, that's greater than 70% off.
[00:55:31.488 --> 00:55:43.171]  Folks, just go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, look at all the specials on the films, or call toll-free and ask about the 9-11 special, ask about the American Dictator special, ask about the book special.
[00:55:44.732 --> 00:55:47.773]  Bumper stickers now are basically free, you just gotta pay for the shipping.
[00:55:50.274 --> 00:56:01.160]  Also, if you want to support the TV ads we're going to be running here in the next few weeks, radio ads in different parts of the country, Americans Against Arnold,
[00:56:17.679 --> 00:56:25.824]  Just write it to Alex Jones, a check or money order, and then just put Americans Against Arnold in the comments section, in the memo section, so I know what to put it towards.
[00:56:29.306 --> 00:56:30.926]  Just take action today, folks.
[00:56:31.647 --> 00:56:33.348]  Please take action today.
[00:56:34.048 --> 00:56:35.689]  On the films, get them, get them out to people.
[00:56:36.389 --> 00:56:38.010]  Let's talk to Ron in Oklahoma.
[00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.331]  Ron, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:56:39.651 --> 00:56:44.614]  Alex, there must be tens of millions of copies of Dale Carnegie's classic
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:54.445]  Personal relations, public relations, books, how to win friends and influence people, laying around addicts, basements, thrift stores, youth bookstores.
[00:56:54.465 --> 00:56:57.887]  Speak up for me, I'm kind of having trouble understanding what you're saying.
[00:56:59.268 --> 00:57:00.088]  Okay, can you hear me?
[00:57:00.488 --> 00:57:01.489]  Yeah, loud and clear now.
[00:57:01.509 --> 00:57:06.752]  Okay, Alex, there must be literally tens of millions of copies of Dale Carnegie's classic
[00:57:07.352 --> 00:57:11.993]  Personal relations, public relations, sales book, how to win friends and influence people.
[00:57:12.313 --> 00:57:14.673]  You can probably buy it for 50 cents at a used bookstore.
[00:57:14.713 --> 00:57:15.094]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:15.594 --> 00:57:25.436]  And, I'll tell you what, I would dearly love to see your listeners find this book, study it, learn the techniques, then they understand when this is being used on you.
[00:57:25.516 --> 00:57:28.076]  This is Cynthia Morgenthau Jones' handbook.
[00:57:28.796 --> 00:57:29.096]  Okay?
[00:57:29.396 --> 00:57:32.357]  I enjoyed your encounter with her.
[00:57:32.417 --> 00:57:34.077]  I never laughed so hard in my life, Alex.
[00:57:35.278 --> 00:57:37.178]  But, this is how they do it.
[00:57:37.654 --> 00:57:45.680]  And if your listeners will find this book and study it, they'll know how they operate, they'll know when it's being used on them, and then they can turn the tables.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:48.842]  And this will also help them get the message out.
[00:57:49.423 --> 00:57:53.466]  Convince other people and deal with other people.
[00:57:53.506 --> 00:57:54.466]  Tell them what's going on.
[00:57:54.527 --> 00:57:58.009]  I read this book... And again, for those who just joined us, tell them who Morgenthaler Jones is.
[00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:05.915]  She is apparently the founding father of the AmendForArnold.com committee.
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:15.144]  Meanwhile, we've got squadrons of senators and congressmen now saying they want Arnold to be president in 08, so she's just the front dummy for all this.
[00:58:15.485 --> 00:58:16.705]  Right, but she is slick.
[00:58:17.045 --> 00:58:26.010]  She is slick, Alex, and your listeners can avail themselves of this knowledge, these techniques, and know what is being used against them, and turn the tables, and use it themselves.
[00:58:27.571 --> 00:58:28.732]  I've read that book.
[00:58:28.952 --> 00:58:31.273]  I kind of organically know how to influence people.
[00:58:32.219 --> 00:58:36.262]  It's called the truth, but... Alex, your listeners are actually read.
[00:58:36.302 --> 00:58:37.522]  They're actually intelligent.
[00:58:38.503 --> 00:58:41.525]  And they can really turn this knowledge to some good.
[00:58:42.565 --> 00:58:43.266]  Alright, Ron.
[00:58:44.106 --> 00:58:45.307]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:58:45.327 --> 00:58:47.508]  Second hour, a ton of news.
[00:58:47.528 --> 00:58:48.809]  Your call's straight ahead.
[00:58:48.849 --> 00:58:50.010]  Don't touch that dial.
[00:58:51.511 --> 00:58:54.052]  Big brother.
[00:58:59.011 --> 00:59:00.091]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.792 --> 00:59:01.872]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.532 --> 00:59:03.392]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.113 --> 00:59:04.993]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.033 --> 00:59:09.334]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.874 --> 00:59:13.995]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.816 --> 00:59:25.639]  Well, as if things couldn't get any worse with Alberto, I Love Torture Gonzalez, the Attorney General pick of Lord Bush, if the pro-abortion,
[00:59:27.262 --> 00:59:37.248]  If the open borders promotion of the gun control isn't enough to make you loving, he's a MECHA member, that's your Hispanic Ku Klux Klan, which the media thinks is acceptable.
[00:59:37.288 --> 00:59:40.630]  I don't think either group's acceptable, the Ku Klux Klan or MECHA.
[00:59:43.331 --> 00:59:46.713]  We now have learned of this, also the mysterious plane crash in Houston yesterday.
[00:59:46.753 --> 00:59:51.876]  The plane, private Learjet coming in to pick up Lord Bush, Herbert Walker Bush, crashes and blows up.
[00:59:53.007 --> 00:59:55.888]  There was a lot of fog, and there's a lot of fog here, man.
[00:59:55.928 --> 00:59:58.290]  It's like Noah's Ark time or something in Texas.
[00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.891]  A lot of people died from the flooding.
[01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:03.612]  Very serious, so watch out.
[01:00:03.732 --> 01:00:04.593]  Low water crossings.
[01:00:06.614 --> 01:00:12.436]  But that's still on the 41st anniversary of the Kennedy assassination that Herbert Walker was on the ground for.
[01:00:13.377 --> 01:00:17.959]  And going to Ecuador, and it's still a little stinky.
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.521]  As I said, the plane was acting erratically.
[01:00:21.541 --> 01:00:22.201]  We'll get into that.
[01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:27.318]  A lot of news on cloning coming right out, cross-species, mixing humans with other animals.
[01:00:27.338 --> 01:00:33.443]  A lot of new developments with ArnoldExposed.com that we'll be talking about as well.
[01:00:34.504 --> 01:00:36.045]  I don't want to dominate the broadcast.
[01:00:36.105 --> 01:00:37.946]  And of course, your phone calls.
[01:00:38.147 --> 01:00:40.248]  Right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:00:40.588 --> 01:00:44.972]  Allie, in... Allie, where are you calling me from today?
[01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:45.872]  Oklahoma.
[01:00:46.213 --> 01:00:47.053]  Another Okie.
[01:00:47.374 --> 01:00:47.494]  Yep.
[01:00:48.034 --> 01:00:48.795]  From Oskokie.
[01:00:48.815 --> 01:00:49.355]  What's going on?
[01:00:52.699 --> 01:01:01.742]  Or maybe they're doing all this cross-breeding, or gene-splitting research to try to create a better candidate to run for president.
[01:01:02.323 --> 01:01:07.185]  Or, I think maybe they already have a half-gorilla, half-human one all lined up.
[01:01:08.205 --> 01:01:08.905]  That's pretty funny.
[01:01:09.285 --> 01:01:11.246]  Yeah, they could say, don't discriminate against the monkey.
[01:01:11.266 --> 01:01:13.827]  We've got to have a humanity as president.
[01:01:15.508 --> 01:01:21.350]  For those that just joined us, Washington Post, ABC News, they're now admitting what's gone on for decades.
[01:01:22.054 --> 01:01:25.515]  Humanzies, part chimpanzee, part human for body parts.
[01:01:26.396 --> 01:01:28.536]  Pigs that have human organs and blood.
[01:01:28.956 --> 01:01:30.597]  They're called chimeras.
[01:01:30.657 --> 01:01:31.057]  Go ahead.
[01:01:32.137 --> 01:01:37.059]  Anyway, what I called about was, did you watch 60 Minutes by chance Sunday?
[01:01:37.079 --> 01:01:38.440]  No, I didn't watch it.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:49.904]  Well, they had a little piece about underreporting of casualties in Iraq, and they said that the casualties have been underreported by 15,000.
[01:01:51.604 --> 01:02:01.089]  They said the official report is about 9,000 disabling injuries and 1,200 deaths.
[01:02:01.809 --> 01:02:02.970]  That number is a few months old.
[01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:08.613]  A few months ago it was 20,000 actually injured and they're saying 9,000.
[01:02:09.433 --> 01:02:12.595]  And the numbers of deaths are clearly much higher but we're not finding that out.
[01:02:13.215 --> 01:02:16.437]  But they were saying that they are not reporting these other 15,000.
[01:02:17.697 --> 01:02:19.678]  Whenever they made this piece it was 15,000 extras.
[01:02:22.845 --> 01:02:29.067]  Also, if you die being flown out via helicopter after being shot or bombed, that doesn't count as dying in combat.
[01:02:29.367 --> 01:02:33.608]  That's right, and they interviewed a couple of GIs who were on a mission looking for insurgents.
[01:02:34.048 --> 01:02:44.410]  And one was paralyzed, and one of them lost his limbs, but they were not considered combat related because they were not involved in an actual combat attack.
[01:02:46.451 --> 01:02:46.871]  Oh, really?
[01:02:46.911 --> 01:02:47.211]  How do they...
[01:02:48.616 --> 01:02:50.817]  I have that little piece on tape.
[01:02:50.977 --> 01:02:52.218]  I hope you send it to me, yeah.
[01:02:52.438 --> 01:03:01.602]  Well, it's right in the middle of a bunch of other stuff, and I'll write to you how you can get to it, but it is just a little short piece, or I could play it for you now if you want to try it.
[01:03:01.622 --> 01:03:02.242]  How long is it?
[01:03:02.762 --> 01:03:03.663]  Oh, it's not very long.
[01:03:03.943 --> 01:03:04.823]  Maybe five minutes.
[01:03:05.303 --> 01:03:07.844]  Yeah, we probably can't play something that long, but send it to me.
[01:03:08.265 --> 01:03:08.625]  Okay.
[01:03:09.365 --> 01:03:10.045]  Alright, I'll do it.
[01:03:10.105 --> 01:03:11.906]  What do you think about Arnold for President?
[01:03:12.546 --> 01:03:13.407]  Are you kidding me?
[01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:28.057]  I think if they get that Constitution amendment that they want, so that they can run him for President, that they're liable to run Gorbachev or Vicente Fox.
[01:03:28.218 --> 01:03:31.800]  Hey, that's a good point.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:37.743]  The Democrats would vote for Vicente Fox or somebody else, and they'll have 30 million illegals voting for him too.
[01:03:37.783 --> 01:03:38.604]  That'll be the swing vote.
[01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:42.219]  Man, I tell ya, that's a whole other area of discussion, isn't it?
[01:03:42.739 --> 01:03:43.339]  That certainly is.
[01:03:43.379 --> 01:03:44.660]  Boy, the elite sure wants it.
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:45.460]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:48.141]  Well, that's why we're fightin' it.
[01:03:48.161 --> 01:03:49.542]  We'll be back with more of your calls.
[01:03:49.622 --> 01:03:50.162]  A lot more.
[01:03:50.242 --> 01:03:52.223]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.244 --> 01:03:57.565]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.766 --> 01:04:02.187]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.327 --> 01:04:06.709]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:08.090]  A New World Order.

[01:04:57.877 --> 01:04:58.417]  Anthrax.
[01:04:58.477 --> 01:05:00.599]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:05:00.859 --> 01:05:02.460]  Alarming words for our time.

[01:05:05.581 --> 01:05:20.150]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:07:10.578 --> 01:07:22.226]  And knowing that there is a war on for your mind and that in a calculated psychological warfare operation, you're being targeted to be conditioned and acclimated to all of this tyranny.

[01:07:40.338 --> 01:07:41.318]  Houston, Texas.
[01:07:41.518 --> 01:07:43.599]  This is from NBC3 in Houston.
[01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:53.262]  A small jet that was to have taken former President Bush on a trip to Ecuador was flying hundreds of feet lower than it should have been when it crashed yesterday.
[01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:56.015]  That's the word from federal investigators.
[01:07:56.035 --> 01:08:03.962]  They say from the plane, clipped a 120 foot high light pole on approach to Houston's Hobby Airport.
[01:08:04.362 --> 01:08:11.268]  Given that the plane was more than three miles from the runway, they say its altitude should have been 1,000 feet.
[01:08:13.749 --> 01:08:20.054]  Investigators are examining a number of factors, including the weather, which was foggy at the time of the crash.
[01:08:20.655 --> 01:08:24.097]  Toxicology tests are being done on the bodies of the three people killed in the crash.
[01:08:24.638 --> 01:08:29.341]  The jet's flight data recorder and cockpit device recorder have been shipped to Washington, D.C.
[01:08:29.782 --> 01:08:31.783]  for analysis, so we'll never know the truth.
[01:08:34.205 --> 01:08:36.387]  And I did see video taken right after the crash.
[01:08:36.607 --> 01:08:37.568]  Totally foggy.
[01:08:37.968 --> 01:08:42.732]  This big, giant light pole on the toll road knocked over.
[01:08:46.329 --> 01:08:58.979]  And a lot of people want to say it's a conspiracy theory, and I'm not going to say that because, well, small jets crash every week or two here in the U.S.
[01:08:59.059 --> 01:09:06.244]  and a lot of times they hit light poles or they hit these radio towers or TV towers.
[01:09:07.806 --> 01:09:13.230]  And it might have some foul play in it.
[01:09:13.570 --> 01:09:15.912]  Instrumentation could have been messed with.
[01:09:17.378 --> 01:09:21.282]  You don't know, but it is suspicious that it was coming to pick the President up.
[01:09:22.523 --> 01:09:23.543]  Was the plane late?
[01:09:23.624 --> 01:09:29.228]  Did the bug in the software activate too early and cause the plane to drop down?
[01:09:29.248 --> 01:09:33.812]  I mean, we know that happened with Ron Brown, Commerce Secretary's plane.
[01:09:34.453 --> 01:09:37.596]  We know he'd been shot in the head beforehand, among others, on board the plane.
[01:09:37.616 --> 01:09:38.797]  And that was even the New York Times.
[01:09:39.277 --> 01:09:41.279]  The colonel who did the autopsy said, Look!
[01:09:41.539 --> 01:09:42.400]  I'm tired of the cover-up!
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:43.361]  He'd been shot in the head!
[01:09:45.703 --> 01:09:46.543]  We know how they did that.
[01:09:46.583 --> 01:09:48.904]  They had some special forces posing as security.
[01:09:48.924 --> 01:09:50.805]  They shoot everybody.
[01:09:51.845 --> 01:09:53.745]  Remote control takes control of the aircraft.
[01:09:55.206 --> 01:09:56.106]  They blow the doors.
[01:09:56.186 --> 01:09:57.807]  Doors were found miles and miles away.
[01:09:57.827 --> 01:10:00.027]  That is, parts of doors.
[01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:06.269]  And they high load or he low load out of there.
[01:10:06.329 --> 01:10:07.810]  Just put on their mask and jumped out.
[01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:10.471]  Then you don't have any dirt on your hands.
[01:10:11.071 --> 01:10:12.491]  Now we know that with that case.
[01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:13.031]  But this?
[01:10:13.752 --> 01:10:14.772]  Probably an accident.
[01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:21.354]  But strange on the 41st anniversary of John F. Kennedy that we didn't even talk about yesterday.
[01:10:21.374 --> 01:10:24.196]  I didn't even look at the polls yesterday.
[01:10:24.236 --> 01:10:28.798]  The polls last year, 92% on average believe the government was involved.
[01:10:29.439 --> 01:10:31.800]  I guess the 8% of you think we're kooks are right, huh?
[01:10:32.801 --> 01:10:40.045]  No amount of TV shows or Peter Jennings or video games explaining how the government didn't do it are going to change anybody's mind.
[01:10:42.506 --> 01:10:47.929]  Even your highly edited Subruder film, you know, shows him back and to the left.
[01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:51.292]  You shoot somebody in the back of the head, the front of their face blows out.
[01:10:52.232 --> 01:10:54.994]  You don't shoot somebody in the back of the head and the back of the head blow off.
[01:10:55.554 --> 01:10:56.575]  That just doesn't happen.
[01:10:57.615 --> 01:11:00.457]  And again, I know most of you haven't shot a wild hog in the head.
[01:11:00.477 --> 01:11:04.219]  I know most of you haven't shot a deer in the head.
[01:11:04.239 --> 01:11:06.361]  And you don't know how this works.
[01:11:06.401 --> 01:11:11.304]  But let's say you shoot a hog in one side of its head, the whole other side of its head blows out.
[01:11:11.821 --> 01:11:13.522]  If you shoot them with a .308 or a .30-06.
[01:11:13.542 --> 01:11:16.463]  Those type of high-powered rounds.
[01:11:19.225 --> 01:11:23.407]  And I can't tell you how many times, hunting, I've shot an animal in the head because I don't like them to have any pain.
[01:11:25.187 --> 01:11:40.975]  And if it's super long distance, 600 yards, I'll shoot them in the chest, if they're facing me, or I'll shoot them in the heart, right forward and to the side, about 5 inches up from where their leg separates from their body.
[01:11:43.414 --> 01:11:53.459]  And they did hundreds of forensic tests and it's in all the criminology books and everybody knows that the side the bullet exits out of is the side that has a large hole.
[01:11:54.559 --> 01:12:02.803]  I mean, you shoot somebody with a high-powered rifle, or you shoot something with a large head with a high-powered rifle, a lot of times it's hard to find the hole where it went in.
[01:12:03.203 --> 01:12:11.827]  The hair will close up around it, the skin will close up around it, there might be a dribble of blood when the cavity repressurizes.
[01:12:12.188 --> 01:12:13.068]  But the other side,
[01:12:14.019 --> 01:12:18.801]  It's a giant splatter wound, usually about four inches large, and blows the brain right out of it.
[01:12:19.141 --> 01:12:21.081]  In fact, I've shot a lot of coyotes in the head.
[01:12:22.862 --> 01:12:27.184]  And you shoot a coyote in the head, and the side of the bullet goes out, basically they don't have a head.
[01:12:27.204 --> 01:12:31.645]  It's like an empty sack.
[01:12:31.665 --> 01:12:40.028]  I don't want to have to go over this for people, but police and military and hunters know this, but unfortunately the general public doesn't.
[01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:48.913]  You shoot somebody in the head with a high-powered rifle, and the side where the bullet comes out is a gigantic hole.
[01:12:50.595 --> 01:12:53.777]  Now, that's just the facts.
[01:12:56.439 --> 01:12:59.342]  I don't want to spend... again, I said I wasn't going to spend time on this, but now I am.
[01:13:01.474 --> 01:13:04.656]  Oh, but I'm really glad that George Herbert Walker Bush wasn't on board that aircraft.
[01:13:04.676 --> 01:13:11.298]  I really am, because we don't want any of the high-level minions of the New World Order to have any harm come to them, because then they're turned into martyrs.
[01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:15.280]  We want George Bush Sr.
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:23.584]  to live as long as possible, so one day he can be brought to justice for Iran-Contra and the cocaine shipments, and for all the crimes he committed.
[01:13:23.624 --> 01:13:24.845]  We want him to be in prison.
[01:13:26.445 --> 01:13:27.866]  We want Bill Clinton in prison.
[01:13:28.416 --> 01:13:40.485]  We're very angry at George Jr., Herbert Walker's son, W, for telling Dan Burton's committee to leave Bill Clinton alone for communist generals in the White House and pardoning cocaine dealers.
[01:13:41.146 --> 01:13:41.987]  That's a crime!
[01:13:42.047 --> 01:13:44.969]  Bill Clinton should be in prison, but he's not because you're conservative leader of protection.
[01:13:48.672 --> 01:13:51.994]  Marines offensive launched south of Baghdad, AP,
[01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:54.851]  Some 5,000 U.S.
[01:13:55.291 --> 01:14:11.437]  Marines, British troops, and Iraqi commandos launched raids and arrested suspected insurgents today in a new offensive aimed at clearing a swath of insurgent hotbeds south of Baghdad, the U.S.
[01:14:11.497 --> 01:14:12.357]  military said.
[01:14:14.118 --> 01:14:18.560]  In other violence, mass gunmen assassinated a Sunni cleric north of Baghdad.
[01:14:21.081 --> 01:14:24.244]  The second such killing in as many days is insurgents hit a U.S.
[01:14:24.264 --> 01:14:24.744]  convoy.
[01:14:25.384 --> 01:14:31.950]  Oh, yeah, yeah, you think, you think, uh, enemy fighters assassinated a Sunni?
[01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:32.610]  Think again.
[01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:38.194]  It's like that CARE woman, CARE International, married to an Iraqi, criticizing the war.
[01:14:39.155 --> 01:14:48.322]  It said over 15 men, two of them white guys, in official Iraqi government police uniforms, came and arrested her.
[01:14:48.342 --> 01:14:50.224]  Next thing you saw, she got her head blown off.
[01:14:52.526 --> 01:14:58.071]  Just like others who were grabbed, FBI picks up Berg, hands him over to Al-Qaeda.
[01:14:58.091 --> 01:14:58.692]  This is admitted.
[01:14:59.092 --> 01:15:00.433]  They go saw his head off.
[01:15:03.636 --> 01:15:05.678]  Time and time again, this stinks to high heaven.
[01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:10.922]  But oh, they say the insurgents killed a Sunni cleric.
[01:15:11.823 --> 01:15:13.905]  Ha!
[01:15:14.706 --> 01:15:15.366]  Yeah, sure.
[01:15:16.767 --> 01:15:17.108]  It says,
[01:15:18.473 --> 01:15:21.736]  The second such killing in as many days, an insurgent said a U.S.
[01:15:21.776 --> 01:15:32.524]  convoy with a roadside bomb near the central Iraq city of Samara, prompting the Americans to open fire, killing an Iraqi hospital, official said.
[01:15:33.545 --> 01:15:36.147]  Killing an Iraqi hospital, official said.
[01:15:36.167 --> 01:15:44.574]  The new offenses of the third large-scale military assault this month aimed at suppressing Iraq's President's insurgency ahead of the crucial elections on January 30th.
[01:15:46.278 --> 01:15:50.402]  Again, no one has announced to run for the presidency.
[01:15:51.043 --> 01:16:04.357]  Because everyone knows, and we've interviewed the foreign reporters who've been in Baghdad, for respected mainstream publications, no one will run because everyone knows if you run, Alawi, known as the Butcher, will kill you!
[01:16:05.498 --> 01:16:09.342]  It's like, it's the same thing with Mohammed Karzai in Afghanistan.
[01:16:12.606 --> 01:16:16.547]  So they're going to have an election with no one running against them, like the old Soviet Union.
[01:16:17.387 --> 01:16:20.888]  They'll probably have some Duma member run against them the last week.
[01:16:21.288 --> 01:16:22.349]  It would look like it was an election.
[01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:26.670]  There'll probably be some Allowee lieutenant who runs against him and gets 20% of the votes.
[01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.990]  Oh, Allowee won by 80%.
[01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:30.671]  Allowee, Allowee, Allowee!
[01:16:32.832 --> 01:16:34.032]  Allowee, Wowee!
[01:16:37.973 --> 01:16:38.813]  My goodness!
[01:16:39.993 --> 01:16:41.674]  Batman, look at Allowee go!
[01:16:44.637 --> 01:16:46.478]  And Iraqis have been interviewed.
[01:16:46.498 --> 01:16:49.079]  I've talked to reporters and heard others being interviewed.
[01:16:50.179 --> 01:16:56.082]  All the Iraqis go, man, this Al-Zawahiri guy, this so-called Al-Qaeda guy, he's CIA.
[01:16:56.342 --> 01:16:57.682]  This is all staged.
[01:16:58.683 --> 01:17:01.944]  Because every time somebody fights back, they just say, oops, see, it's Al-Qaeda.
[01:17:02.984 --> 01:17:04.745]  The government claimed they killed him a year ago.
[01:17:05.185 --> 01:17:06.646]  They claimed they've killed him four times.
[01:17:07.346 --> 01:17:08.727]  They've even displayed his body.
[01:17:09.687 --> 01:17:12.008]  Now they claim Saddam's sons are alive again, out killing.
[01:17:12.368 --> 01:17:13.969]  They already showed us wax figurines.
[01:17:14.682 --> 01:17:16.742]  They claim they killed Bin Laden, what, four times?
[01:17:16.782 --> 01:17:19.683]  They claim they killed... How many times they gotta kill these guys?
[01:17:19.723 --> 01:17:22.184]  And then it's like an inside joke the public doesn't even remember.
[01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:24.644]  Wait, you said you killed that guy four times.
[01:17:26.285 --> 01:17:28.425]  And they never retract that, oh, we didn't kill him.
[01:17:28.465 --> 01:17:41.848]  It's, we killed him and now he's still alive, and we killed him again, and Timmacle Ali's alive, and... So, all they do is squeeze the insurgents into other areas, like toothpaste.
[01:17:44.463 --> 01:17:46.945]  When they try to bottle them up again, it just doesn't work.
[01:17:46.985 --> 01:17:49.566]  It's like trying to squeeze mercury in your hands.
[01:17:50.227 --> 01:17:51.467]  It just squeezes out of the corners.
[01:17:51.948 --> 01:17:52.228]  U.K.
[01:17:52.248 --> 01:17:54.749]  Defense Secretary Eyed blast Iran.
[01:17:55.270 --> 01:18:04.655]  Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon has said he would press the button for a nuclear strike on Iran if it was menacing Britain with ballistic missiles.
[01:18:05.696 --> 01:18:12.720]  Mr. Hoon's doomsday warning threatens to wreak havoc on Europe's current diplomatic efforts to prevent Iraq development of atomic weapons.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:13.941]  It is unclear
[01:18:15.979 --> 01:18:20.062]  It is under orders to stop its uranium enrichment programs by today.
[01:18:20.182 --> 01:18:25.787]  Iran insists its nuclear work is aimed solely at meeting fuel needs.
[01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:38.277]  Mr. Hu marched into the delicate maneuvering during a private speech at Nottingham University.
[01:18:38.597 --> 01:18:40.639]  We'll be back with your calls, a bunch of other news.
[01:18:42.165 --> 01:18:46.190]  About Alberto Alaporto Gonzalez, who is also a Mecha member.
[01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:49.934]  FrozenPlanet.tv, we'll be right back.
[01:18:49.954 --> 01:18:50.335]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.605 --> 01:18:59.108]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:18:59.469 --> 01:19:03.552]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:03.852 --> 01:19:04.392]  We listened.
[01:19:04.693 --> 01:19:09.696]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:09.977 --> 01:19:10.457]  We listened.
[01:19:10.817 --> 01:19:13.879]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:14.840]  We listened.
[01:19:15.301 --> 01:19:18.463]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:19:18.683 --> 01:19:19.163]  I think?
[01:19:44.016 --> 01:19:44.557]  That's toll-free, 803-4438.
[01:19:44.577 --> 01:19:45.738]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:53.536 --> 01:19:54.998]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[01:19:55.298 --> 01:19:59.883]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:20:00.223 --> 01:20:02.566]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[01:20:11.375 --> 01:20:14.078]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[01:20:25.708 --> 01:20:33.555]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.

[01:20:52.907 --> 01:20:55.409]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[01:20:55.789 --> 01:20:58.712]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[01:20:58.852 --> 01:21:02.515]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[01:21:02.695 --> 01:21:05.137]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[01:21:05.297 --> 01:21:08.540]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:16.086]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[01:21:16.306 --> 01:21:17.988]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.
[01:21:18.068 --> 01:21:21.872]  You can also get AM and FM, listen to cassettes, and control your CD changer.
[01:21:21.992 --> 01:21:23.994]  Call Freeway Radio today, toll-free, 866-404-3600.
[01:21:24.154 --> 01:21:24.655]  That's 1-866-404-3600.

[01:21:35.666 --> 01:21:40.110]  The good news for us is that you'll have GCN programming and crystal clear radio wherever you go.
[01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:45.295]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[01:21:45.395 --> 01:21:47.917]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[01:21:53.268 --> 01:21:54.769]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:54.829 --> 01:21:57.231]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[01:21:57.591 --> 01:21:58.452]  Let me rephrase that.
[01:21:58.832 --> 01:22:00.053]  Oil War III has started.
[01:22:00.353 --> 01:22:02.795]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[01:22:03.215 --> 01:22:06.617]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[01:22:07.038 --> 01:22:07.878]  Why else would the U.S.
[01:22:07.898 --> 01:22:10.860]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.381]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[01:22:12.842 --> 01:22:17.305]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[01:22:17.745 --> 01:22:21.728]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[01:22:22.248 --> 01:22:28.153]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[01:22:28.393 --> 01:22:34.479]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[01:22:35.019 --> 01:22:35.599]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:22:35.619 --> 01:22:41.264]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[01:22:41.705 --> 01:22:42.205]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:22:42.225 --> 01:22:44.327]  Pre-email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[01:22:44.347 --> 01:22:44.867]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:23:17.413 --> 01:23:22.954]  Alright, Enoch and Michael and Tim and Joshua and Charles, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[01:23:24.134 --> 01:23:27.595]  Then I'm going to get into La Raza confirms Gonzalez is on
[01:23:29.511 --> 01:23:32.032]  Their members list, Alberto Gonzalez.
[01:23:32.372 --> 01:23:35.492]  So now he's part of a Hispanic supremacist organization.
[01:23:36.753 --> 01:23:40.594]  Also government uses color laser printer technology to track documents.
[01:23:42.354 --> 01:23:44.735]  Smart Dust may soon be watching you.
[01:23:44.795 --> 01:23:47.195]  This is out of King 5 television out of Seattle.
[01:23:48.896 --> 01:23:54.197]  The euro rises above the dollar yet again, hitting a new record.
[01:23:56.001 --> 01:24:00.103]  100 tanks have been withdrawn from Korea, moved to Iraq.
[01:24:01.404 --> 01:24:02.624]  So we'll cover that as well.
[01:24:03.225 --> 01:24:06.626]  More on how the FDA is going to try to track everything you do.
[01:24:08.267 --> 01:24:11.669]  More on the proposal with tax drivers based on how much they drive.
[01:24:14.230 --> 01:24:18.492]  And Bill could criminalize fast-forwarding DVD ads and trailers.
[01:24:18.532 --> 01:24:19.973]  This is out of NBC television.
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.320]  It never ends, folks.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:23.561]  A lot of craziness coming up.
[01:24:23.961 --> 01:24:24.981]  Right now, your calls.
[01:24:25.161 --> 01:24:25.621]  Enoch!
[01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:27.402]  Enoch, where are you calling from?
[01:24:28.182 --> 01:24:28.882]  Pennsylvania.
[01:24:29.182 --> 01:24:29.542]  Welcome.
[01:24:30.363 --> 01:24:31.643]  Yes, Alex.
[01:24:32.103 --> 01:24:35.944]  Basically, your comments about Arnold Schwarzenegger and Alawi.
[01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:51.089]  You know, what I'm going to do on my part is definitely write and contact all my congressmen and my senators, you know, and tell them I oppose them against them eliciting the constitutional ban for this knucklehead to run as president.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:57.105]  And I'm going to do my best to work with all the fellow Americans in this country to do the same thing.
[01:24:58.687 --> 01:25:07.936]  This year, and also when 2008 does appear, I pray this country remains strong and vigilant and keep our Constitution just as it is.
[01:25:08.056 --> 01:25:14.042]  Yeah, the reason we're fighting this now is they're running the psychological warfare op to condition everybody to accept it.
[01:25:14.102 --> 01:25:15.403]  We've got to counter it now.
[01:25:16.184 --> 01:25:16.404]  Right.
[01:25:16.946 --> 01:25:25.171]  Because if we don't, we're going to end up like having another O'Reilly where he will run unopposed and definitely can shoot us anytime he wants to.
[01:25:27.512 --> 01:25:28.693]  Well, not literally speaking.
[01:25:28.733 --> 01:25:30.534]  Let me attract that.
[01:25:30.554 --> 01:25:32.435]  Look, Arnold would just be a puppet.
[01:25:32.895 --> 01:25:38.158]  They want him because of his international stature for global popularity to be part of a global figure.
[01:25:39.359 --> 01:25:45.482]  But remember, we could get a, as a caller said, a Mikhail Gorbachev, a Vicente Fox could come here and run.
[01:25:45.923 --> 01:25:46.603]  Anybody could.
[01:25:47.361 --> 01:25:50.462]  Right, and if we do that, we're no longer a nation any longer.
[01:25:50.482 --> 01:25:59.623]  That means that we definitely have destroyed our Constitution once and for all by definitely putting the final nail in the coffin by letting this man run.
[01:25:59.923 --> 01:26:03.544]  Well, during a Constitutional Convention, they could change everything as well.
[01:26:03.584 --> 01:26:04.564]  Thanks for the call, Enoch.
[01:26:05.064 --> 01:26:06.385]  I appreciate you getting involved.
[01:26:06.465 --> 01:26:07.685]  ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:10.465]  Michael in California.
[01:26:10.485 --> 01:26:11.066]  Thanks for holding.
[01:26:11.106 --> 01:26:11.526]  Go ahead.
[01:26:11.546 --> 01:26:12.486]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:12.506 --> 01:26:13.146]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:26:13.286 --> 01:26:13.486]  Good.
[01:26:14.184 --> 01:26:14.864]  Hey, thanks so much, man.
[01:26:14.884 --> 01:26:15.425]  I love what you do.
[01:26:16.605 --> 01:26:26.910]  Last week, I know this gentleman was in one of your videos I was watching, and I think it was in the financial reports video, but I wanted to know if you could get the word out about Joe Bannister being indicted last week.
[01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:28.030]  Yes, he was arrested.
[01:26:28.130 --> 01:26:33.173]  Joe Bannister, treasury agent, IRS criminal investigator, went public.
[01:26:33.713 --> 01:26:37.014]  He's in my film, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, exposed.
[01:26:37.695 --> 01:26:38.315]  We've called him.
[01:26:38.335 --> 01:26:39.335]  We're going to get him on as a guest.
[01:26:39.375 --> 01:26:40.516]  That's in the stack of news.
[01:26:41.376 --> 01:26:47.619]  And they came and arrested him, basically because he's been putting out all this literature of how it's all a fraud.
[01:26:47.959 --> 01:26:48.820]  He heard D.B.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:27:02.226]  Kidd on a big syndicated show in California, didn't believe her, spent two years researching it, found out it was true, found out it was private, found out that the IRS works for private banks, went public, and now they've indicted him.
[01:27:02.266 --> 01:27:02.667]  Go ahead.
[01:27:03.367 --> 01:27:05.548]  No, I just wanted to put out a plug for his website.
[01:27:05.568 --> 01:27:09.610]  I mean, JoeBannister.blogspot.com Say that again?
[01:27:10.563 --> 01:27:12.864]  Joe Bannister.blogspot.com
[01:27:34.059 --> 01:27:35.300]  I just wanted to get the word out.
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:36.081]  I mean, it's pretty sad.
[01:27:36.101 --> 01:27:39.843]  The guy, a good Catholic Christian guy, and they just, they're just, they're going to hash him out.
[01:27:39.883 --> 01:27:41.584]  I mean, look at Simkhanin.
[01:27:41.725 --> 01:27:45.107]  I mean, Simkhanin or whatever, however you say it, he got screwed too.
[01:27:45.407 --> 01:27:51.912]  Yeah, he was a senior, senior officer and wrote him a letter going, look, can you answer these questions?
[01:27:52.212 --> 01:27:53.813]  I've checked out what they claim, it's true.
[01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:56.755]  And I'm going to have to resign if you can't answer it.
[01:27:56.775 --> 01:27:57.596]  And I said, resign.
[01:27:58.371 --> 01:28:04.012]  So he resigned, was in big ads in USA Today, exposing this, and now they've come and arrested him.
[01:28:04.052 --> 01:28:05.713]  Thanks for the call, Michael.
[01:28:06.053 --> 01:28:07.153]  I'm glad you brought this up.
[01:28:08.093 --> 01:28:09.333]  We're going to break here in a moment.
[01:28:09.353 --> 01:28:12.954]  We'll come back and talk to Tim and Joseph and Charles and others.
[01:28:12.994 --> 01:28:15.935]  Total free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:17.835 --> 01:28:20.236]  I'll dig out that Joe Bannister article and cover it.
[01:28:20.256 --> 01:28:22.356]  I mean, that's the type of news we forget to cover every day.
[01:28:22.376 --> 01:28:23.896]  There's so much of it.
[01:28:24.817 --> 01:28:26.757]  We'll cover some more news, then go back to your calls.
[01:28:27.867 --> 01:28:31.811]  There's so much coming up, so please, please, please stay with us.
[01:28:31.871 --> 01:28:32.832]  More on cloning.
[01:28:33.273 --> 01:28:36.576]  They're now going public about crossing humans with animals.
[01:28:37.157 --> 01:28:40.100]  It's been going on for a long, long time.
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:41.001]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:42.182]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:43.784 --> 01:28:44.705]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.185 --> 01:28:46.807]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.708 --> 01:28:50.391]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.775 --> 01:28:55.957]  Pam got some mud out of her three-year-old's shirt.
[01:28:56.357 --> 01:28:58.159]  Jason had a wine stain on his countertop.
[01:28:58.459 --> 01:28:58.939]  Now gone.
[01:28:59.179 --> 01:29:01.261]  Halloween makeup from Karen's kid got on the carpet.
[01:29:01.601 --> 01:29:02.022]  No trick.
[01:29:02.442 --> 01:29:03.122]  It's gone too.
[01:29:03.523 --> 01:29:04.744]  What do these people have in common?
[01:29:05.024 --> 01:29:08.787]  They've discovered the powerful bubble-up technology in BioWalk Citrus Concentrate.
[01:29:08.987 --> 01:29:11.709]  Kelly brought a puppy home and it left a mess on the new carpet.
[01:29:11.909 --> 01:29:13.691]  Now her carpet still looks brand new.
[01:29:14.031 --> 01:29:18.333]  Fran said, it's the most effective pet odor removal product she's ever encountered.
[01:29:18.513 --> 01:29:19.894]  What do these people have in common?
[01:29:20.194 --> 01:29:24.557]  They've discovered the power of pods or pet accident wash-up solutions from Bio-Op.
[01:29:24.897 --> 01:29:27.098]  Have you discovered the Bio-Op family of products?
[01:29:27.848 --> 01:29:30.249]  Just in from BioWox, their November special.
[01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:37.634]  You get two quarts of BioWox Citrus Concentrate, two dilution bottles and sprayers, and two 32-ounce bottles of pause for only $44.95.
[01:29:38.014 --> 01:29:39.855]  That's a savings of nearly $45.
[01:29:41.396 --> 01:29:43.397]  Clean your house in time for the holidays by calling 866-246-6943.
[01:29:43.437 --> 01:29:44.718]  That's 866-246-6943 or visit BioWox.com.
[01:29:52.972 --> 01:29:54.954]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:55.034 --> 01:30:05.742]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.122 --> 01:30:10.646]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a black Berkey purification element.
[01:30:10.706 --> 01:30:22.055]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:22.635 --> 01:30:29.482]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:29.882 --> 01:30:32.024]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:32.505 --> 01:30:37.489]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:43.915]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:30:44.816 --> 01:30:48.340]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:30:48.621 --> 01:30:50.963]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[01:30:59.653 --> 01:31:06.358]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:31:06.558 --> 01:31:12.143]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:31:12.463 --> 01:31:20.289]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering the lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:31:20.549 --> 01:31:21.830]  Either way, why chance it?
[01:31:21.930 --> 01:31:31.897]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.
[01:31:32.137 --> 01:31:36.300]  Sea Minerals provides a complete and balanced set of minerals and trace elements found in our oceans.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:41.263]  Reclaim that youthful, energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help of minerals from the sea.
[01:31:41.403 --> 01:31:43.264]  Call Sea Minerals today, toll-free, 877-835-5555.
[01:31:43.284 --> 01:31:43.604]  That's 877-835-5555.
[01:31:43.624 --> 01:31:43.925]  Or visit
[01:31:51.750 --> 01:32:10.681]  You know, it's funny.
[01:32:10.721 --> 01:32:14.583]  I printed that off from the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:32:14.663 --> 01:32:19.126]  I know it's posted at PrisonPlanet.com right now about Joe Bannister.
[01:32:19.966 --> 01:32:25.609]  But for some reason it's not in my stack, but we're going to get Joe on the broadcast, and I think the website's what?
[01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:27.671]  FreedomAboveFortune.com.
[01:32:28.431 --> 01:32:31.453]  Senior criminal investigations officer.
[01:32:31.473 --> 01:32:41.999]  Her DV kid, one of the premier experts on the fraudulent nature of the income tax, on talk radio, thought, man, that lady is just criminal.
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:43.860]  I'm going to disprove her.
[01:32:44.721 --> 01:32:49.404]  Got her material, spent two years researching it, found out it was worse than what she said.
[01:32:51.094 --> 01:32:57.058]  And last time I talked to Joe he was still paying taxes because he said even though it's not a law they'll still arrest you.
[01:32:57.778 --> 01:32:59.259]  He put out some books and videos.
[01:32:59.619 --> 01:33:01.040]  Now they've come and arrested him.
[01:33:03.141 --> 01:33:06.403]  Let me just blitz through some news then we'll get to all your calls.
[01:33:06.884 --> 01:33:09.806]  Dolphins protect New Zealand swimmers from shark.
[01:33:10.786 --> 01:33:12.207]  I just think this is a neat story.
[01:33:12.827 --> 01:33:18.771]  A pod of dolphins circled protectively around a group of New Zealand swimmers to fend off an attack by great white sharks.
[01:33:19.511 --> 01:33:20.192]  Media reported
[01:33:20.948 --> 01:33:41.504]  Today, Lifesavers Rob Howes and his 15-year-old daughter Nissy, Karina Cooper, and Helen Slade were swimming 300 feet off Ocean Beach near Wagangaree on New Zealand's North Island when the dolphins herded them, apparently to protect them from a shark.
[01:33:41.944 --> 01:33:42.985]  Yeah, dolphins do that.
[01:33:43.125 --> 01:33:44.026]  Little sweetie pies.
[01:33:44.747 --> 01:33:46.368]  They started to herd us up.
[01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:52.012]  They pushed all four of us together by doing tight circles around us.
[01:33:52.613 --> 01:33:55.235]  Howells told the New Zealand Press Association.
[01:33:56.035 --> 01:34:03.921]  Howells tried to drift away from the group, but two of the bigger dolphins herded him back just as he spotted a nine-foot great white shark swimming towards the group.
[01:34:05.622 --> 01:34:06.683]  I just recoiled.
[01:34:06.743 --> 01:34:07.984]  It was only about two
[01:34:09.739 --> 01:34:18.890]  Meters away from me, the water was crystal clear, and it was clear as the nose on my face howled, referring to the distance of six feet.
[01:34:20.291 --> 01:34:22.995]  They had corralled us up to protect us, he said.
[01:34:23.035 --> 01:34:24.036]  Yeah, dolphins do that.
[01:34:24.416 --> 01:34:26.739]  They attack great white sharks.
[01:34:26.959 --> 01:34:28.321]  Great whites feed on their babies.
[01:34:29.324 --> 01:34:30.125]  They're mammals, folks.
[01:34:30.145 --> 01:34:31.725]  They're like dogs, but a lot smarter.
[01:34:32.026 --> 01:34:37.809]  The Lifesavers spent the next 40 minutes surrounded by the dolphins before they could safely swim back to the shore.
[01:34:37.869 --> 01:34:44.072]  The incident happened on October 30th, but the Lifesavers kept the story to themselves until now.
[01:34:51.167 --> 01:34:52.928]  Lifeguards out there swimming, this happened.
[01:34:53.288 --> 01:34:56.609]  Environment Group, Orca Research and Dolphins Attack Sharks.
[01:34:56.629 --> 01:35:05.253]  Again, the Environment Group, Orca Research and Dolphins Attack Sharks to protect themselves and their young, so their actions protecting the life savers was understandable.
[01:35:06.454 --> 01:35:13.657]  They could have sensed the danger to the swimmers and taken action to protect them, Orca's Ingrid Visser told NZPA.
[01:35:18.519 --> 01:35:18.599]  Oh!
[01:35:19.565 --> 01:35:24.607]  Of course, if those dolphins were Americans, they probably would have run off and called 9-1-1.
[01:35:25.947 --> 01:35:29.289]  How dare they have instincts to even protect another species?
[01:35:29.369 --> 01:35:31.350]  Maybe if they just ran in fear, they'd be safe.
[01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:38.412]  Oh no, actually, they attack sharks to keep them out of their territories because they know attacking is the best defense.
[01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:45.095]  I wish humans could attack against our own criminal species in the Info War, the criminal elite that are feeding on us.
[01:35:46.555 --> 01:35:48.156]  We've been taught to run and cower in fear.
[01:35:49.264 --> 01:35:50.724]  Alright, another weird analogy.
[01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:56.806]  News executives calls anti-Arnold movement clan-like, promises to alert FBI.
[01:35:58.246 --> 01:36:04.708]  Now we have this news director's name, and we know what city he's in and what station in Tennessee.
[01:36:06.028 --> 01:36:09.089]  Very close to one of our AM affiliates in the state.
[01:36:09.949 --> 01:36:11.009]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:36:12.609 --> 01:36:15.250]  And we have the email trail and the name and the guy's phone number.
[01:36:15.894 --> 01:36:16.934]  So I called yesterday.
[01:36:16.994 --> 01:36:17.815]  I called this morning.
[01:36:17.875 --> 01:36:18.915]  I called over and over again.
[01:36:18.955 --> 01:36:19.875]  He hasn't called me back.
[01:36:20.456 --> 01:36:22.936]  Saying, is this really your email you sent out?
[01:36:24.577 --> 01:36:25.877]  Because you know, somebody could have faked it.
[01:36:26.138 --> 01:36:26.878]  But I don't think so.
[01:36:27.898 --> 01:36:28.938]  And he won't call me back.
[01:36:30.319 --> 01:36:41.763]  So if he hasn't called me back in a couple days, we're going to put his name on his own email that he sent out to one of our listeners that sent him an email about our press release that's now been picked up by AP
[01:36:43.484 --> 01:36:47.627]  San Antonio Express News, about to be picked up by two of the biggest publications in the country.
[01:36:48.628 --> 01:36:52.591]  Then on CNN, I mean, you know, I'm treated with respect when the media calls me.
[01:36:53.071 --> 01:36:54.432]  They take this very serious.
[01:36:54.472 --> 01:36:56.374]  They know about the allegations we make about Arnold.
[01:36:56.654 --> 01:36:58.215]  They know most of those have been documented.
[01:36:58.275 --> 01:36:59.396]  Arnold hasn't even denied them.
[01:37:03.899 --> 01:37:09.063]  But we send this guy, well, somebody sends him our press releases we ask folks to do, and I want to thank you.
[01:37:09.643 --> 01:37:10.844]  And this is what they get back.
[01:37:11.770 --> 01:37:17.152]  News executive calls anti-Arnold movement clan-like, promises to alert FBI.
[01:37:17.992 --> 01:37:26.676]  We've received the following email from a reader who had forwarded the Americans Against Arnold press release to mainstream news media executives and journalists.
[01:37:27.996 --> 01:37:34.759]  This response came from the vice president of a Tennessee-based CBS affiliate in a very large city.
[01:37:35.639 --> 01:37:40.801]  In the email, he likens Alex Jones and Americans Against Arnold movement to the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:37:41.681 --> 01:37:49.447]  Saying they are a probable, this is a quote, threat to our freedom and safety and are not fit to carry Governor Schwarzenegger's luggage.
[01:37:50.468 --> 01:37:54.331]  It is completely baffling to try to understand the logic in play here.
[01:37:54.891 --> 01:38:03.738]  Why is opposing someone who said publicly that they admired Adolf Hitler and campaigned in Austria for admitted Nazi Kurt Voltheim?
[01:38:04.779 --> 01:38:07.841]  Schwarzenegger's Nazi ties are detailed in links at the end of the article.
[01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:19.613]  We're opposing a man who called black people, well, sat down with them and called them the n-word, and once stated, if you gave these blacks a country to run, they would run it down the tubes.
[01:38:21.533 --> 01:38:24.834]  We fight the racists, so this makes us racist.
[01:38:24.994 --> 01:38:33.236]  The email is reprinted below and gives us another insight into the warped minds of the people who are behind the Gropenfuhrer becoming president.
[01:38:34.358 --> 01:38:35.438]  That's a play on words.
[01:38:35.498 --> 01:38:38.559]  In Austria, a governor is called a Gruppenfuhrer.
[01:38:38.619 --> 01:38:46.042]  Alright, this is the weird email, but this fits the psychology we've seen by establishment people.
[01:38:47.662 --> 01:38:51.263]  I respect and support your right to protest and speak your opinion.
[01:38:51.323 --> 01:38:55.545]  Please accept my right to be repulsed by your not-so-veiled bigotry.
[01:38:56.465 --> 01:38:56.685]  So...
[01:38:58.639 --> 01:39:02.823]  Now, white people are against a white guy, so we're anti-white, see?
[01:39:03.443 --> 01:39:04.124]  It's really weird.
[01:39:04.564 --> 01:39:08.548]  Short-sightedness and misinformed, as well as ill-guided viewpoint.
[01:39:08.628 --> 01:39:09.428]  Oh, we're misinformed!
[01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:15.113]  Unless you are a direct descendant of an American Indian, you are not a Native American.
[01:39:15.313 --> 01:39:17.755]  So, see, he's saying, how dare you say Arnold can't be president.
[01:39:18.116 --> 01:39:22.960]  You are most likely, according to your definition, a descendant of, in your words, a foreign usurper.
[01:39:24.602 --> 01:39:25.502]  That's my words.
[01:39:26.023 --> 01:39:29.024]  How dare you exercise a right to free speech?
[01:39:31.845 --> 01:39:32.185]  Wow!
[01:39:33.245 --> 01:39:34.006]  I'm a journalist.
[01:39:34.126 --> 01:39:36.867]  I obsess over fairness, truth, and human rights.
[01:39:37.527 --> 01:39:38.628]  I bet you obsess on it.
[01:39:39.768 --> 01:39:46.050]  I fear people like you, not because of your power, but because of your bigotry that threatens a free people.
[01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:49.952]  Let me just read you a quote from Arnold in U.S.
[01:39:49.992 --> 01:39:51.813]  News and World Report when he was 44 years old.
[01:39:53.658 --> 01:39:55.439]  People need somebody to watch over them.
[01:39:55.459 --> 01:39:59.481]  95% of people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[01:39:59.961 --> 01:40:00.621]  The same article.
[01:40:00.962 --> 01:40:04.023]  My relationship to power and authority is, I'm all for it.
[01:40:05.604 --> 01:40:08.265]  I look down on little people who are waiting, who are wanting.
[01:40:11.787 --> 01:40:12.447]  I'm a journalist.
[01:40:12.487 --> 01:40:13.527]  I obsess over fairness.
[01:40:14.508 --> 01:40:15.068]  He goes on.
[01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:22.872]  We've not met, but I envision you enveloped in a white sheet and a white pointed cloth hat.
[01:40:23.701 --> 01:40:25.362]  Masking the hatred beneath.
[01:40:26.383 --> 01:40:29.745]  I've not yet formed an opinion about the proposed change of the Constitution.
[01:40:30.325 --> 01:40:35.789]  But let me assure you that Governor Schwarzenegger and others like him, who have come to our great country, do not take it for granted.
[01:40:36.409 --> 01:40:43.414]  Do not condone, let alone subscribe to idiotic, bigoted ideology.
[01:40:43.454 --> 01:40:46.916]  And he would have the courage to attach his name to the document
[01:40:48.257 --> 01:40:51.519]  Sent in a mass email such as the one you sent anonymously.
[01:40:51.799 --> 01:40:54.140]  He quotes our press release with my name on it and says that.
[01:40:54.581 --> 01:41:02.665]  You may want to note that you're allegedly endeavoring to protect the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:41:02.745 --> 01:41:16.273]  So far, the only opinion I've formed regarding this is that you and your band of gutless, anonymous, Ku Klux Klan-like marauders are a probable threat to our freedom and safety and are not fit to carry Governor Schwarzenegger's luggage.
[01:41:16.895 --> 01:41:26.702]  I hope the FBI, I'm copying this email to them, ooooh, investigate your organization, a possible root of hate crimes.
[01:41:27.522 --> 01:41:33.887]  If you care to leave me on your email list, let me thank you in advance for the forced exercise of my middle finger.
[01:41:35.308 --> 01:41:37.289]  The one I use to click the delete button.
[01:41:40.217 --> 01:41:43.319]  And, uh, I keep calling the guy going, uh, sir, would you like to comment on this?
[01:41:43.359 --> 01:41:44.059]  Is this your email?
[01:41:44.079 --> 01:41:45.760]  If you don't call me, I'll consider it as yours.
[01:41:46.121 --> 01:41:48.202]  It's got the headers, and your phone number, and your email.
[01:41:49.963 --> 01:41:51.384]  I mean, is this what you have to say?
[01:41:52.364 --> 01:42:03.250]  Perhaps I should read my press release, where we stand up against racism, and groping of women, and illegal drug use, and... 80 plus percent of Americans in major polls are against the men in the Constitution for Arnold.
[01:42:05.572 --> 01:42:09.274]  Uh... Arnold wants to run for President,
[01:42:10.607 --> 01:42:11.928]  And we're opposed to it.
[01:42:13.369 --> 01:42:18.031]  And so, I mean, this is how bizarro it is.
[01:42:21.533 --> 01:42:27.737]  It's just, it's just ultra, ultra, ultra, ultra, ultra, ultra weird.
[01:42:27.757 --> 01:42:30.859]  A few more articles will go to your calls.
[01:42:31.019 --> 01:42:36.122]  Many who voted for values still like their television sin.
[01:42:36.162 --> 01:42:38.623]  And it talks about the most violent
[01:42:39.184 --> 01:42:46.511]  TV shows, desperate housewives, a show about housewives having sex with teenage males.
[01:42:47.291 --> 01:42:52.996]  That's number one, but it's not number one in the blue zones for Kerry, where you think of people as the most decadent.
[01:42:54.958 --> 01:42:59.262]  But no, no, no, it's the Bible Belt in the Christian conservative states.
[01:43:00.443 --> 01:43:05.628]  That's also where porn sales are the highest and bathhouses are most popular.
[01:43:06.981 --> 01:43:09.062]  Just the statistics, you know, and it's true.
[01:43:09.122 --> 01:43:18.907]  The results of the presidential election are still being praised for what they say about the electorate's supposed closer embrace of traditional cultural values.
[01:43:18.967 --> 01:43:26.811]  But for a network television executive, changes with defining programs that speak to taste across the nation, one lesson is clear.
[01:43:26.831 --> 01:43:31.373]  The proposed cultural divide is more like a cultural mind meld.
[01:43:33.291 --> 01:43:44.238]  And it talks about where the most vile Hollywood productions and TV productions are on are in Salt Lake City, Birmingham, Alabama.
[01:43:45.359 --> 01:43:46.380]  Places like that.
[01:43:48.601 --> 01:43:50.122]  Well, yeah, they've done the statistics.
[01:43:50.202 --> 01:43:52.864]  Interracial porn is biggest in Alabama.
[01:43:54.825 --> 01:43:56.286]  Biggest in Louisiana.
[01:43:56.326 --> 01:43:57.247]  Biggest in Texas.
[01:43:58.247 --> 01:44:00.349]  It's just something else, folks.
[01:44:00.928 --> 01:44:02.829]  Yeah, see, deep down they like Schwarzenegger.
[01:44:03.029 --> 01:44:10.073]  They like it that he is for open borders and gun control and is on the front of gay porno mags.
[01:44:10.133 --> 01:44:14.695]  I mean, a lot of these Christian conservatives probably own it and probably enjoy it quite a bit.
[01:44:16.296 --> 01:44:18.537]  They probably get off on the Nazi bit, too.
[01:44:19.614 --> 01:44:24.657]  And Arnold saying he had a slash Nietzsche Soviet plan to take over America.
[01:44:25.017 --> 01:44:27.038]  That's the London Observer, by the way.
[01:44:27.519 --> 01:44:29.500]  Oh, you're for a Soviet takeover plan!
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:30.440]  Oh my goodness!
[01:44:31.001 --> 01:44:32.482]  We are for you, my friend!
[01:44:32.602 --> 01:44:34.643]  Oh, Alberto Gonzales, you're for abortion?
[01:44:35.123 --> 01:44:37.445]  And 12-year-olds not having to tell their parents when they have one?
[01:44:37.525 --> 01:44:38.625]  Oh, you're for open borders?
[01:44:38.965 --> 01:44:41.387]  And a member of MECHA, the Hispanic Ku Klux Klan group?
[01:44:41.747 --> 01:44:43.328]  Oh my gosh, we're all for you!
[01:44:43.388 --> 01:44:44.809]  You're for open borders and gun control?
[01:44:46.539 --> 01:44:48.560]  Alright, we'll go to your calls here in about four minutes.
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:49.760]  I'm not going to keep him long.
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:50.900]  He's Dwayne Cooch.
[01:44:51.861 --> 01:45:03.924]  He's our great IT guy running all our servers for PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.net and Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com and VirginUtah.com.
[01:45:06.285 --> 01:45:12.707]  And he knows an attack on our servers when he sees it.
[01:45:14.489 --> 01:45:17.390]  And that has certainly happened.
[01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:21.091]  And, Dwayne, I love food that's burning in the oven.
[01:45:21.111 --> 01:45:22.071]  It's good you just called in.
[01:45:22.111 --> 01:45:23.792]  I want you to talk for two minutes while I run and turn it off.
[01:45:23.852 --> 01:45:24.552]  I can smell it burning.
[01:45:24.832 --> 01:45:26.453]  I've got a fire on my hands!
[01:45:26.493 --> 01:45:28.633]  No, I actually don't have that, but it's starting to smoke a bit.
[01:45:29.754 --> 01:45:33.575]  But tell us about what we're experiencing at ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:45:34.395 --> 01:45:35.955]  Well, sure.
[01:45:36.075 --> 01:45:41.657]  It came up about two days ago, two or three days after the site was launched.
[01:45:42.467 --> 01:45:50.212]  Uh, and, uh, it kind of coincided with the press releases and we looked at it and it appeared to be a normal spike, you know, in traffic and everything.
[01:45:50.232 --> 01:46:01.980]  Uh, but we, we did notice that, uh, the amount of, uh, usage across the network was, was like, uh, exponentially greater than the number of page views coming in.
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:11.086]  I mean, we were doing our normal huge amount of traffic and, and, uh, you know, when you, when you launched the site about the Oberführer, it really, really kicked up, uh, you know, a good 20% perhaps.
[01:46:12.948 --> 01:46:32.474]  But we're noticing on the network connection itself, the pipes that come in to connect the server to the internet, the switches are seeing perhaps as high as 28%, I'm looking at the charts here, and it's spiking around 30% sometimes, of nothing but junk packets coming in.
[01:46:33.228 --> 01:46:34.788]  So, pretty much that has to be said.
[01:46:34.808 --> 01:46:40.910]  Now again, those are specific, not targeted at the servers itself, but at the pipelines themselves, pretty obvious.
[01:46:41.190 --> 01:46:42.730]  Yes sir, exactly, exactly.
[01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:56.333]  They're junk requests, and we've traced back literally two or three hundred of them, just picking them randomly, IPs from the log files, and it appears that they are mostly drones, slave machines,
[01:46:57.343 --> 01:47:01.105]  You know, machines that are using a man in the middle or a hobo.
[01:47:01.125 --> 01:47:02.646]  Rise of the machines?
[01:47:03.226 --> 01:47:05.607]  Yes, right, right.
[01:47:06.468 --> 01:47:19.595]  So, what happens is, a group or individual sets it up to go out and when you're asleep and your computer's on, it launches out to all these other computers, takes control of them, and then starts having them do requests.
[01:47:19.895 --> 01:47:20.855]  Wow, look at you.
[01:47:21.235 --> 01:47:21.476]  Yes.
[01:47:22.616 --> 01:47:23.276]  Oh, look at me.
[01:47:23.336 --> 01:47:23.977]  Stop it, Dwayne.
[01:47:24.857 --> 01:47:25.718]  Look at you!
[01:47:25.778 --> 01:47:27.019]  Look at you!
[01:47:27.359 --> 01:47:30.841]  Again, but only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise.
[01:47:31.161 --> 01:47:34.503]  They're targeting, not the general architecture of the server.
[01:47:34.603 --> 01:47:36.564]  Oh no, because that would show up immediately.
[01:47:36.905 --> 01:47:38.005]  That would show up right away.
[01:47:39.106 --> 01:47:42.128]  They're targeting key weak points, so it's clear this is an attack.
[01:47:42.768 --> 01:47:44.850]  But luckily, Dwayne, you're keeping it up and running for us.
[01:47:44.890 --> 01:47:45.170]  Go ahead.
[01:47:45.190 --> 01:47:45.810]  Oh, you bet, man.
[01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:46.190]  You bet.
[01:47:46.411 --> 01:47:47.451]  We're doing fine now.
[01:47:48.052 --> 01:47:53.555]  Like I said, twenty-five, twenty-eight, thirty-eight, thirty percent spike.
[01:47:54.088 --> 01:47:55.930]  And really that's just junk traffic.
[01:47:55.950 --> 01:47:57.032]  So it's not hurting the server.
[01:47:57.072 --> 01:47:58.393]  The server isn't even noticing it.
[01:47:58.714 --> 01:48:05.822]  What it's mostly doing is it's snotting, pardon my term near the lunch hour here, but it's snotting up the pipe coming in.
[01:48:07.143 --> 01:48:08.305]  The packets don't do any harm.
[01:48:08.325 --> 01:48:09.086]  They don't do anything.
[01:48:09.366 --> 01:48:11.589]  They just simply make it more difficult
[01:48:12.029 --> 01:48:12.629]  We're good to go.
[01:48:31.090 --> 01:48:38.172]  As we do that filtering, so that we don't filter out any good requests from you guys, you know, from your listeners and the great folks out there.
[01:48:38.192 --> 01:48:39.672]  We don't want to lose any of their traffic.
[01:48:39.692 --> 01:48:44.394]  We don't want you to... Well, this started within an hour of us launching the site, so they're watching.
[01:48:46.214 --> 01:48:51.436]  Yeah, I don't know, you know, I haven't gone back that far because we're kind of in the middle of it right now.
[01:48:51.556 --> 01:49:00.118]  But I remember you said that first day when we launched it that it was suspicious and, you know... Yeah, it looked funny because your webmasters did report that they were having some trouble
[01:49:00.838 --> 01:49:03.480]  You know, as far as performance on the upload side.
[01:49:03.981 --> 01:49:08.224]  And so we checked the server and the thing is not even running at 1%.
[01:49:08.924 --> 01:49:10.946]  It's less than 1% load on the box.
[01:49:10.966 --> 01:49:12.907]  That's how mega big this server is.
[01:49:13.268 --> 01:49:16.070]  And so, a few days ago I checked it, it was 3 million.
[01:49:16.090 --> 01:49:17.871]  I'm sure it's 5 million now I haven't checked.
[01:49:18.271 --> 01:49:22.254]  So what would you, I mean, so do we have to count some of our visitors aren't really visitors?
[01:49:22.334 --> 01:49:24.296]  Or does that show up on that log?
[01:49:24.916 --> 01:49:25.797]  No, no.
[01:49:25.897 --> 01:49:27.198]  What you see on your log
[01:49:27.913 --> 01:49:30.836]  are real blood and flesh and bone visitors.
[01:49:31.176 --> 01:49:32.817]  This junk traffic doesn't even show up.
[01:49:32.877 --> 01:49:34.259]  That's why it was so hard to pin down.
[01:49:34.639 --> 01:49:37.381]  You won't see it on your log files or on your traffic reports.
[01:49:37.882 --> 01:49:39.764]  This is on the network switches.
[01:49:39.984 --> 01:49:45.068]  They have obtained the data tapes for our system.
[01:49:45.849 --> 01:49:49.012]  Alright, hey, listen, I appreciate you, Dwayne, coming on.
[01:49:49.032 --> 01:49:49.932]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:49:49.952 --> 01:49:51.033]  No, man, we're on it.
[01:49:51.414 --> 01:49:52.395]  Thanks a million, brother.
[01:49:53.573 --> 01:49:55.073]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.233 --> 01:49:58.334]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.474 --> 01:50:02.355]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.395 --> 01:50:06.656]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:06.996 --> 01:50:10.777]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:12.698]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:20.964]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.124 --> 01:50:24.166]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.346 --> 01:50:27.208]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.688 --> 01:50:33.813]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.353 --> 01:50:38.138]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:52:59.477 --> 01:53:02.279]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:08.165]  Alright, your calls are coming up, Kim, Joshua, Charles, Michael, Mary.
[01:53:08.365 --> 01:53:09.746]  We'll get to everybody.
[01:53:09.946 --> 01:53:12.428]  Ton of other news, believe me, I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:53:13.029 --> 01:53:15.491]  Dwayne, you're an IT guy, just a separate issue.
[01:53:16.272 --> 01:53:19.195]  They're trying to now pass a congressional law, it's now official.
[01:53:19.235 --> 01:53:20.596]  We've heard the rumors for months.
[01:53:21.457 --> 01:53:22.718]  This is from NBC News.
[01:53:24.133 --> 01:53:31.755]  They're going to try to make it criminal on your TiVo box or anything, even on your VCR, if you fast-forward past commercials.
[01:53:32.195 --> 01:53:39.898]  I mean, this is starting to get nuts, Dwayne, and they're going to try to enforce that, I guess, off the digital cable boxes that watch what you watch and what you do.
[01:53:39.958 --> 01:53:40.378]  Comments?
[01:53:41.598 --> 01:53:42.879]  Hard to make illegal.
[01:53:43.079 --> 01:53:48.120]  I would love to see that enforced and, you know, I just don't believe it.
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:50.901]  I believe they may be trying, my friend, but I don't know.
[01:53:51.776 --> 01:53:57.818]  Here's NBC 17, Bill could criminalize fast forwarding DVDs, ads and trailers.
[01:53:58.818 --> 01:54:02.839]  And then they, it just gets crazier and crazier.
[01:54:03.039 --> 01:54:05.460]  Oh yeah, the criminalized part of it is what's important.
[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:07.361]  It's just one more thing.
[01:54:09.801 --> 01:54:12.382]  The move to criminalize just about everything you say and do.
[01:54:13.401 --> 01:54:16.084]  That's where the nugget is in that gym.
[01:54:16.424 --> 01:54:17.745]  Well, I guess we ought to be happy.
[01:54:17.785 --> 01:54:19.166]  We've had millions of visitors.
[01:54:19.186 --> 01:54:22.029]  We're cracking to surpass the Arnold.
[01:54:22.129 --> 01:54:23.310]  I'm in for Arnold, people.
[01:54:23.610 --> 01:54:30.276]  Here real quick, Dwayne, despite the fact that they've gotten literally, I'd say 90 times the coverage we've gotten.
[01:54:30.716 --> 01:54:31.917]  Well, I'm looking at 1.1805433 so far this week.
[01:54:38.882 --> 01:54:41.824]  But the way I looked at it, it was about 3 million.
[01:54:41.924 --> 01:54:43.425]  Am I reading all those stats?
[01:54:43.445 --> 01:54:44.846]  There's so many different ways to look at it.
[01:54:44.886 --> 01:54:46.566]  Yeah, that's month to date you're looking at.
[01:54:46.987 --> 01:54:47.807]  That's month to date.
[01:54:50.128 --> 01:54:57.853]  But the site was actually active way before there was a page on it, or there was actually a site on it.
[01:54:58.313 --> 01:55:00.774]  Well, you've got to teach me how to look at those numbers then.
[01:55:00.894 --> 01:55:01.775]  Oh, you bet, you bet.
[01:55:02.175 --> 01:55:07.658]  Again, millions of people coming and visiting, and that's got to scare the globalists.
[01:55:08.599 --> 01:55:12.081]  Well, apparently, yeah, and we're looking at a retaliation right now.
[01:55:13.142 --> 01:55:22.549]  I am seeing a, let me see, let's look at the real stuff here, $4,527,000 since it opened, since the grand opening there.
[01:55:23.370 --> 01:55:25.391]  So, not too bad, not too shabby at all.
[01:55:25.491 --> 01:55:32.737]  Yeah, I've got to get a lesson from you how to read those numbers, because I look at them and there's all these different things and I don't...
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:34.881]  It's hard to know.
[01:55:35.281 --> 01:55:37.703]  So, I haven't overestimated saying 3 million then.
[01:55:38.043 --> 01:55:38.383]  Oh, no.
[01:55:38.423 --> 01:55:38.844]  Not at all.
[01:55:39.164 --> 01:55:39.344]  No.
[01:55:40.225 --> 01:55:42.506]  Well, DeWayne, thank you so much for the great job you're doing.
[01:55:42.546 --> 01:55:45.909]  By the way, you own Robinet, nationwide internet service.
[01:55:47.147 --> 01:55:53.389]  And we've got a cloaking device where when you surf the net, they don't know who you are and can't track you, so you have your anonymity.
[01:55:54.009 --> 01:56:02.672]  That's with the basic package when you get dial-up, hyper-dial-up service for cheaper than it is with AOL and you don't get spied on at Infowars.net, Dwayne.
[01:56:02.852 --> 01:56:07.334]  That's the place, at Infowarsnetwork.com, if you want to be an information warrior.
[01:56:08.010 --> 01:56:12.172]  Uh, you know, go to InfoWarsNetwork.com and we'll help you make a webpage.
[01:56:12.212 --> 01:56:13.332]  Doesn't matter your skill level.
[01:56:13.672 --> 01:56:14.413]  Get the word out.
[01:56:14.493 --> 01:56:16.293]  Yeah, you've got the really simple tools to do it.
[01:56:16.313 --> 01:56:16.553]  That's right.
[01:56:16.573 --> 01:56:17.374]  And really good prices.
[01:56:17.554 --> 01:56:17.854]  That's right.
[01:56:17.914 --> 01:56:19.115]  On server space, Dwayne.
[01:56:19.195 --> 01:56:19.575]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:20.375 --> 01:56:21.796]  Alright, InfoWars.net.
[01:56:21.856 --> 01:56:24.577]  A whole world of information warfare to defend the Republic.
[01:56:24.837 --> 01:56:25.777]  Thanks for coming on, buddy.
[01:56:25.917 --> 01:56:26.397]  Alright, my friend.
[01:56:26.417 --> 01:56:26.938]  Have a great day.
[01:56:27.178 --> 01:56:27.798]  Good to hear from you.
[01:56:27.818 --> 01:56:28.578]  That's a great guy.
[01:56:28.638 --> 01:56:35.221]  And if anybody wouldn't be with InfoWars.net, why would you be with a big service that spies on you and gives you horrible service?
[01:56:36.158 --> 01:56:38.459]  Okay, Shaila V. and FullWars.net.
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:45.964]  Before I'm going to end the hour, we'll go straight to calls in the next hour, and then straight back after that into all the news that I've been mentioning and we haven't gotten to yet.

[01:57:15.581 --> 01:57:16.682]  Big discounts right now.

[01:57:37.106 --> 01:57:38.347]  Third hour is straight ahead.

[01:57:39.328 --> 01:57:39.768]  Stay with us.
[01:57:40.849 --> 01:57:41.269]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.195 --> 01:57:52.275]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.955 --> 01:57:54.056]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.716 --> 01:57:55.556]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.296 --> 01:57:57.177]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.197 --> 01:58:01.518]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.038 --> 01:58:06.179]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:12.601]  Now into hour number three, my friends, on this Tuesday edition.
[01:58:15.521 --> 01:58:18.162]  As we accelerate towards Thanksgiving,
[01:58:21.312 --> 01:58:23.753]  And I don't take off a lot, but I'm going to take off Thanksgiving.
[01:58:23.773 --> 01:58:25.274]  Hang out with my family.
[01:58:25.294 --> 01:58:27.275]  I've got some good rebroadcast coming up for you there.
[01:58:29.776 --> 01:58:33.917]  We're about to go to Tim and Joshua and Charles and Michael and Mary and everybody else coming up.
[01:58:33.957 --> 01:58:37.239]  Then Bill will criminalize fast-forwarding DVD ads and trailers.
[01:58:39.219 --> 01:58:46.262]  Also, mysterious George W. Bush billboards popping up that literally look like something out of North Korea.
[01:58:46.282 --> 01:58:49.003]  It says, George W. Bush, our leader.
[01:58:51.354 --> 01:58:52.395]  Yeah, I want to say that
[01:59:18.757 --> 01:59:27.301]  No, listening to Utah compared to Arnold, if the whole country, if the whole nation could see that, there would be no comparison.
[01:59:27.421 --> 01:59:31.683]  I mean, you would be up for election much more than he would.
[01:59:32.663 --> 01:59:36.805]  I'd have to have a bunch of dirt in my past and say that I have the global order.
[01:59:37.485 --> 01:59:43.128]  I mean, obviously they want him because he's this iconic puppet, this archetype they can use.
[01:59:43.488 --> 01:59:45.249]  Yeah, you're not screwed up enough like he is.
[01:59:45.269 --> 01:59:47.890]  So, I mean,
[01:59:48.891 --> 01:59:54.714]  The trouble is, how do you get somebody like you to get publicized enough to get, you know, even get that out?
[01:59:54.974 --> 01:59:56.254]  I don't even think it's possible.
[01:59:56.274 --> 01:59:57.835]  Well, presidents are just puppets.
[01:59:59.556 --> 02:00:09.180]  So, I don't really put any stock in... Well, like you say, it's not even a vote anymore.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:13.562]  Now it's all just staged elections, and I believe that... It is federally now.
[02:00:14.494 --> 02:00:20.759]  I don't even think, I don't even think next, in the next four years, when four years comes up again, I don't even think there's going to be many people voting.
[02:00:20.799 --> 02:00:22.260]  I think people have lost confidence.
[02:00:23.561 --> 02:00:24.021]  Majority.
[02:00:24.281 --> 02:00:30.386]  Well, if I started talking like this, and I was a big movie star, then maybe they would want me to run for president.
[02:00:31.347 --> 02:00:33.889]  People need somebody to watch over them.
[02:00:33.909 --> 02:00:38.092]  95% of people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[02:00:38.112 --> 02:00:39.573]  And that's U.S.
[02:00:39.633 --> 02:00:40.614]  News & World Report.
[02:00:41.735 --> 02:00:42.736]  Just a few years ago.
[02:00:43.056 --> 02:00:44.116]  That's who he is.
[02:00:44.156 --> 02:00:45.097]  That's why they love him.
[02:00:45.117 --> 02:00:48.779]  Well, they're coming at us from so many different angles right now.
[02:00:48.959 --> 02:00:50.099]  How do you even cover it all?
[02:00:50.139 --> 02:01:06.307]  You're trying your best to cover everything that they're trying to do to us people, but I guess there's a few things that stand out in my mind and I think one of the big things is this forced psychological testing that you're talking about with the school children.
[02:01:06.487 --> 02:01:07.428]  Yeah, that passed.
[02:01:07.850 --> 02:01:09.332]  Yeah, that's what I heard.
[02:01:09.392 --> 02:01:17.764]  And I called my local school district and I asked to see a manuscript of their agenda, you know, on all these things and they said they couldn't talk to me about it.
[02:01:18.024 --> 02:01:19.907]  And I said, well, I don't have kids in school.
[02:01:20.548 --> 02:01:22.110]  I'm still paying school taxes.
[02:01:23.433 --> 02:01:34.143]  And she says, well, then you don't have the right to... Yeah, when you call talk show host anybody who are neocons, you go, well, they passed it, or they're going to pass it when they were, and they're like, we can't talk about it!
[02:01:34.664 --> 02:01:34.844]  No.
[02:01:34.884 --> 02:01:36.285]  We're not supposed to talk about it!
[02:01:36.546 --> 02:01:41.170]  Oh, but they can talk about Scott Peterson, you know, the murderer there, and nobody cares about that.
[02:01:41.991 --> 02:01:45.635]  Well, it's for homeschoolers, private schoolers, but now they've got to try to implement it.
[02:01:45.995 --> 02:01:47.076]  Passing is one thing.
[02:01:47.956 --> 02:01:50.577]  And the backlash could make them repeal that part.
[02:01:50.597 --> 02:01:53.217]  They put it in as a rider on the big spending bill.
[02:01:53.757 --> 02:02:01.819]  Now the 9-11 legislation for Patriot Act 2 and Secret Arrest and National ID Card, that did not pass.
[02:02:02.239 --> 02:02:04.380]  So now they're going to have a special session in December.
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:08.981]  Every time I mention this I get calls or emails going, wait a minute, that didn't pass.
[02:02:09.321 --> 02:02:11.302]  Two separate pieces of legislation.
[02:02:12.062 --> 02:02:12.922]  So what you're saying is
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:17.322]  Getting it passed is totally different than enforcing it.
[02:02:18.883 --> 02:02:20.724]  Well, yeah, I mean, they're going to run into big trouble.
[02:02:21.184 --> 02:02:25.267]  Look, a criminal doesn't have to answer questions under the Fifth Amendment.
[02:02:25.568 --> 02:02:37.916]  But they're going to claim your child has to spend a day, twice a year, under psychiatric evaluation, answering questions, tissue samples, when the guidelines were written by the drug companies.
[02:02:38.116 --> 02:02:39.678]  I hope you're not proposing adults.
[02:02:40.458 --> 02:02:41.399]  Oh, yes, that's in the law.
[02:02:41.419 --> 02:02:42.600]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:47.788 --> 02:02:53.273]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.713 --> 02:02:57.937]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:02:58.177 --> 02:03:05.204]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.584 --> 02:03:11.690]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:11.850 --> 02:03:13.071]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.391 --> 02:03:16.335]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:16.496 --> 02:03:18.518]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:18.819 --> 02:03:26.069]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:26.369 --> 02:03:29.754]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:03:30.174 --> 02:03:33.299]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:03:33.319 --> 02:03:33.379]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:33.399 --> 02:03:33.439]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:34.581]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:03:34.601 --> 02:03:34.841]  Call today.
[02:03:45.294 --> 02:03:48.575]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.615 --> 02:03:52.816]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.037 --> 02:03:55.837]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:56.017 --> 02:03:58.438]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.618 --> 02:04:07.261]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.441 --> 02:04:08.802]  The Berkeley light is different.
[02:04:09.002 --> 02:04:13.183]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.503 --> 02:04:14.264]  We're good to go!
[02:04:42.744 --> 02:04:49.147]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:49.327 --> 02:04:53.769]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:53.889 --> 02:04:58.270]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:59.671]  The New World Order.
[02:05:00.391 --> 02:05:01.212]  Can emerge.
[02:05:01.453 --> 02:05:05.697]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:05.737 --> 02:05:12.685]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:12.805 --> 02:05:14.808]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:15.188 --> 02:05:25.636]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:25.796 --> 02:05:31.200]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:05:31.681 --> 02:05:35.604]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:35.624 --> 02:05:36.064]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:36.144 --> 02:05:37.905]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:05:49.901 --> 02:05:54.085]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:05:54.725 --> 02:05:55.566]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.307 --> 02:05:57.187]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.888 --> 02:06:01.811]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.071 --> 02:06:06.195]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.756 --> 02:06:14.262]  Alright, my friends, we're 8 minutes and 20 seconds into this third hour on this Tuesday edition.
[02:06:15.501 --> 02:06:25.604]  Let's continue with the callers who've been holding forever, then I'll go back into all the news we haven't covered yet, like Smart Dust may soon be watching you, and much more.
[02:06:25.704 --> 02:06:28.564]  Right now, Joshua in South Carolina.
[02:06:28.604 --> 02:06:29.584]  Joshua, go ahead.
[02:06:29.845 --> 02:06:31.245]  Hey Alex, what's going on?
[02:06:31.845 --> 02:06:35.706]  Doing a national radio broadcast and talking to Joshua from South Carolina.
[02:06:36.706 --> 02:06:39.527]  Well, I gotta tell you one thing, we're under Amber Alert.
[02:06:42.074 --> 02:06:44.055]  And they started that in Dallas, Texas.
[02:06:44.075 --> 02:06:51.039]  They put in all these FEMA signs and now they say report illegal guns, stop terrorists, don't litter.
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:56.603]  So now they've turned into tattletale government advisement signs like they have in the Running Man.
[02:06:56.883 --> 02:06:57.603]  Yep, that's it.
[02:06:58.043 --> 02:07:00.645]  What is yours doing right now?
[02:07:00.665 --> 02:07:04.087]  Well, it just came over the radio just a little bit ago.
[02:07:04.127 --> 02:07:08.049]  They said that there's some couples are running and they got an Amber Alert.
[02:07:09.190 --> 02:07:09.970]  It's crazy, man.
[02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.951]  Some who are what-ing?
[02:07:11.849 --> 02:07:12.709]  I don't know what it is.
[02:07:12.749 --> 02:07:14.630]  They just said that they scrapped the man.
[02:07:14.650 --> 02:07:21.694]  I don't know if I want to give out the description, but they just have the whole state on our emergency.
[02:07:22.694 --> 02:07:23.535]  So it's crazy.
[02:07:23.655 --> 02:07:24.915]  But what are they running from?
[02:07:25.576 --> 02:07:26.176]  I don't know.
[02:07:26.256 --> 02:07:27.036]  They never told us.
[02:07:27.237 --> 02:07:37.762]  They just told us that the man in the description of the vehicle, and they said they'd taken his wife and his four-year-old daughter somewhere, and they never described where he was from or nothing.
[02:07:39.182 --> 02:07:39.382]  All right.
[02:07:39.402 --> 02:07:40.303]  Well, thanks for the call.
[02:07:41.447 --> 02:07:48.610]  Look, what's dangerous about this, certainly if somebody's been kidnapped or there's a problem, the media is always more than happy locally to talk about it.
[02:07:49.751 --> 02:07:50.311]  They love that.
[02:07:51.031 --> 02:08:00.796]  They contact the media, they instantly do it, but instead, in 97, they put FEMA control boxes, called EAS boxes, before you got the alert and you tuned to the dial.
[02:08:01.696 --> 02:08:06.258]  Now, by law, everything has to be wired through it, so FEMA can take control.
[02:08:07.619 --> 02:08:09.740]  And now they take control of the radio stations,
[02:08:11.884 --> 02:08:13.825]  And it's, watch out for floods.
[02:08:14.525 --> 02:08:15.966]  Don't use illegal drugs.
[02:08:17.126 --> 02:08:18.086]  Look for terrorists.
[02:08:18.126 --> 02:08:20.487]  Call this toll-free number for suspicious activity.
[02:08:22.708 --> 02:08:39.994]  I mean, literally, it's the highway signs, the radio, the TV, and now they've said, and I've had FCC people on about this, they're trying to pass a law to get control of the telephones and computers, where then they take control of your radios, your TV, but also your phones, your computers, and it flashes alerts at you.
[02:08:42.333 --> 02:08:44.834]  So it's about total control of all the communications.
[02:08:44.914 --> 02:08:56.239]  And now, I've got all the photos on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com of, you know, report terrorists, don't drink and drive, report family violence, you know, tattle on your neighbors.
[02:08:57.079 --> 02:09:05.803]  And I've got a big stack of articles today about, over in England, in the US, they say, parents, if your child's downloading music illegally, go ahead and report them.
[02:09:05.843 --> 02:09:07.204]  Turning them into police is good.
[02:09:07.604 --> 02:09:08.884]  Report on your family members.
[02:09:09.425 --> 02:09:09.845]  Remember,
[02:09:11.261 --> 02:09:13.342]  November is Bonus Recruitment Month.
[02:09:13.522 --> 02:09:17.202]  Report a family member and get a double bonus.
[02:09:17.883 --> 02:09:21.223]  This is ICS reminding you, seeing is believing.
[02:09:21.263 --> 02:09:22.724]  Coming up next, The Running Man.
[02:09:24.384 --> 02:09:28.605]  And in that movie, big billboards, big government TVs advising.
[02:09:29.105 --> 02:09:30.986]  Gotta have your special little scan pass.
[02:09:31.606 --> 02:09:33.086]  All throwing it in your face.
[02:09:37.807 --> 02:09:38.287]  Isn't it funny?
[02:09:38.387 --> 02:09:40.708]  Arnold plays in all these movies where he fights tyranny.
[02:09:41.983 --> 02:09:46.266]  But in reality, he's, yes, we're going to put satellite trucker boxes in all your cars and tax you.
[02:09:46.346 --> 02:09:46.807]  Ha ha!
[02:09:47.187 --> 02:09:49.429]  Little people need to be controlled and dominated.
[02:09:49.449 --> 02:09:53.612]  And it's happening here in Texas everywhere.
[02:09:53.652 --> 02:09:56.454]  They're telling us, oh, yeah, there's about to be a toll road for all the major roads.
[02:09:56.714 --> 02:09:59.537]  Don't worry, you won't have to drive through a toll road because you'll have to have a transponder.
[02:10:00.617 --> 02:10:03.520]  And the average cost will only be $1,800 a year!
[02:10:06.462 --> 02:10:09.064]  So many people in grocery stores and restaurants and
[02:10:09.764 --> 02:10:13.926]  We're at the malls, whenever I'm out walking the dog, they stop their car, the next car stops.
[02:10:14.426 --> 02:10:19.989]  Hey Alex, I used to think you were a kook, but I heard that thing on the news about the boxes, tracking us and taxing us.
[02:10:20.530 --> 02:10:24.211]  But they stop and go, man, I heard that about splashing people with animals.
[02:10:25.252 --> 02:10:26.313]  That just happened yesterday.
[02:10:26.973 --> 02:10:28.614]  All these emails, I thought you were a kook.
[02:10:29.174 --> 02:10:30.955]  Everything you told me, it's coming true.
[02:10:31.015 --> 02:10:31.735]  How'd you know?
[02:10:32.136 --> 02:10:32.856]  Are you psychic?
[02:10:32.916 --> 02:10:34.837]  No, it's all in government documents.
[02:10:36.758 --> 02:10:38.659]  But I told you, you're not going to listen until it happens.
[02:10:39.289 --> 02:10:43.932]  And so now, when your child comes home and goes, yeah, what did you do today?
[02:10:44.632 --> 02:10:47.234]  Oh, we got sat down for four periods of the class.
[02:10:47.254 --> 02:10:48.334]  They're doing it tomorrow again.
[02:10:49.175 --> 02:11:01.082]  And they ask me questions, and I looked at ink blots, these pictures, and they ask what they look like, and they hook me up to a system to read my brainwaves, and I play with these puzzles, and they ask me if I was depressed, and if you abused me.
[02:11:01.743 --> 02:11:01.963]  What?
[02:11:02.503 --> 02:11:03.323]  You call the school?
[02:11:03.404 --> 02:11:03.904]  Just wait.
[02:11:03.924 --> 02:11:04.844]  It'll be a year or so.
[02:11:05.085 --> 02:11:05.765]  You'll be calling.
[02:11:06.519 --> 02:11:07.820]  You'll call the school and go, what's going on?
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:09.220]  Well, sir, it's the law.
[02:11:10.241 --> 02:11:12.062]  It's in the student handbook you were given at the beginning of the year.
[02:11:12.102 --> 02:11:12.942]  It's for their safety.
[02:11:12.982 --> 02:11:15.404]  You want us to find if your child's sick, don't you?
[02:11:15.584 --> 02:11:16.684]  And then a lot of you will get the call.
[02:11:16.724 --> 02:11:18.605]  They say they're going to go from 15% to half.
[02:11:19.266 --> 02:11:20.226]  They're going to be on drugs.
[02:11:20.326 --> 02:11:21.287]  Half, they say, are mentally ill.
[02:11:21.307 --> 02:11:21.907]  You'll get the call.
[02:11:24.208 --> 02:11:26.389]  And we need you to come in to see the doctor.
[02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:30.171]  If you don't, we're going to have to call out Child Protective Services.
[02:11:30.211 --> 02:11:31.652]  We found signs of mental illness.
[02:11:33.166 --> 02:11:33.706]  What do you mean?
[02:11:34.187 --> 02:11:39.531]  Well, your ten-year-old Cole, sometimes they get scared and they have anxiety and they feel upset.
[02:11:41.012 --> 02:11:42.813]  Your child has been diagnosed, sir.
[02:11:44.955 --> 02:11:46.816]  And, uh, well, just enjoy it!
[02:11:48.297 --> 02:11:49.818]  That'll be your wake-up call!
[02:11:50.799 --> 02:11:51.540]  Just enjoy.
[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:54.302]  And a lot of you, through fear, will just decide to embrace it.
[02:11:54.342 --> 02:11:58.905]  Instead of admitting the horror of what's happened, you will decide to embrace it and think I gave you power over it.
[02:12:00.037 --> 02:12:04.100]  And you'll put your child on a couple drugs, and they'll really start having big problems, and you'll put them on even more drugs.
[02:12:04.581 --> 02:12:09.265]  Then you may walk in, God forbid, and your ten-year-old will be dead in bed.
[02:12:09.305 --> 02:12:25.118]  They would have had a huge heart attack from the drugs, or perhaps they'll have a brain embolism, or go insane, and then you can make excuses about it, and you know, and you'll think back, man, my child was fine until they went on those drugs, but of course there'll be a law where you can't sue.
[02:12:27.443 --> 02:12:28.803]  It's all freedom, though, isn't it?
[02:12:28.904 --> 02:12:29.784]  Isn't it all about freedom?
[02:12:30.544 --> 02:12:31.704]  Let's talk to Joshua.
[02:12:31.724 --> 02:12:32.525]  We already talked to Joshua.
[02:12:32.865 --> 02:12:33.425]  Charles.
[02:12:34.105 --> 02:12:35.586]  Charles in Louisiana.
[02:12:35.606 --> 02:12:35.986]  Go ahead.
[02:12:36.006 --> 02:12:39.827]  Mr. Jones, what do you mean about the fast forward and trailers?
[02:12:40.447 --> 02:12:42.628]  Fast forward and videotaping trailers?
[02:12:42.648 --> 02:12:44.249]  Well, laws have been proposed.
[02:12:46.330 --> 02:12:47.190]  And it is true.
[02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:56.373]  But they want to pass a law that if you record on VCR or with a TiVo system, that if you fast forward or rewind, that it'll be a misdemeanor crime.
[02:12:57.398 --> 02:12:58.379]  Well, how are they going to know that?
[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:02.062]  The TiVo and the digital cable boxes track everything you do.
[02:13:02.082 --> 02:13:02.742]  Okay.
[02:13:03.122 --> 02:13:08.346]  Well, look, I'm reporting they got a new tape out for children to shoot President Kennedy.
[02:13:08.767 --> 02:13:08.967]  See that?
[02:13:09.007 --> 02:13:09.507]  No, I know.
[02:13:09.948 --> 02:13:11.449]  I have the review of the game.
[02:13:11.489 --> 02:13:12.870]  I watched clips of it online.
[02:13:13.551 --> 02:13:14.952]  And it proves how
[02:13:15.752 --> 02:13:29.905]  You can, how somebody in 6.5 seconds can get off three shots with a bolt-action rifle, the most precision-trained SWAT team commander, we've had him on this show, will tell you that is impossible!
[02:13:30.405 --> 02:13:30.786]  Try it!
[02:13:31.366 --> 02:13:41.796]  Try it at a shooting range, try to aim at 200 yards away, and be able to put it into a six-inch group, and imagine it being moving, you can't even
[02:13:42.698 --> 02:13:45.179]  Aim, fire, cock the gun, shoot again.
[02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:49.142]  You can do it in about seven seconds, but you can't even aim.
[02:13:49.982 --> 02:13:51.323]  I have to ask you one other question.
[02:13:51.583 --> 02:13:54.424]  How many people in America do you think have got shortwave radios?
[02:13:55.345 --> 02:13:56.846]  Probably 15, 20 million.
[02:13:57.286 --> 02:13:59.207]  Probably 30 million have got one in the garage.
[02:13:59.787 --> 02:14:06.391]  Well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to start getting cords, which you show on InfoWars.com, Prison Planet, and start passing that out.
[02:14:06.931 --> 02:14:08.512]  All my equipment was stolen Monday.
[02:14:09.645 --> 02:14:11.226]  And so I'm kind of down right now.
[02:14:11.246 --> 02:14:12.287]  Oh, what happened to you?
[02:14:12.307 --> 02:14:15.169]  Now you're the guy who's made how many copies of my videos?
[02:14:15.389 --> 02:14:16.530]  A little over 5,000.
[02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:18.891]  That's in five years now.
[02:14:19.392 --> 02:14:20.232]  That's five years.
[02:14:21.073 --> 02:14:22.654]  And somebody stole your equipment?
[02:14:22.854 --> 02:14:27.077]  Well, I went to my son-in-law, and he was helping me, and my neighbor was helping me.
[02:14:27.097 --> 02:14:33.542]  We used to start running off three at a time, and my neighbor and my son-in-law, they've got DCRs.
[02:14:33.562 --> 02:14:35.123]  We're going to run five copies at a time.
[02:14:35.143 --> 02:14:35.803]  They're going to help me.
[02:14:36.184 --> 02:14:38.085]  So I moved the stuff down by him.
[02:14:38.843 --> 02:14:49.387]  He lives sort of, you know, off the road, sort of in the woods, and he called me and told me, well, it was a Monday night, I believe, I believe it was, that everything was tooken.
[02:14:49.687 --> 02:14:50.068]  He went out.
[02:14:50.088 --> 02:14:53.589]  Well, five VCRs and the cables should only cost a couple hundred bucks.
[02:14:53.709 --> 02:14:54.449]  Well, I'm going to get it.
[02:14:54.469 --> 02:14:58.971]  Yes, I've just kind of, well, I took the tools and, you know, it just kind of devastated me.
[02:14:59.011 --> 02:15:00.812]  I just feel kind of... Oh, they took other stuff.
[02:15:00.832 --> 02:15:01.592]  Well, God bless you.
[02:15:01.612 --> 02:15:02.253]  That's horrible news.
[02:15:02.273 --> 02:15:03.233]  Well, I took all my tapes and...
[02:15:04.042 --> 02:15:04.843]  But it's alright.
[02:15:04.863 --> 02:15:07.005]  Hey, but I'm going to start passing these cards out.
[02:15:07.325 --> 02:15:08.886]  And I'm asking you listeners, please.
[02:15:09.386 --> 02:15:11.828]  I've been calling here for years about passing these tapes out.
[02:15:14.351 --> 02:15:17.133]  If you just get the tapes and wake your family up, you would do something.
[02:15:17.413 --> 02:15:19.054]  But you can't listen to this radio show.
[02:15:19.074 --> 02:15:20.275]  This man's putting his heart out.
[02:15:20.395 --> 02:15:21.937]  Other people are putting their heart out.
[02:15:22.317 --> 02:15:23.978]  It's time for you to do something, people.
[02:15:24.379 --> 02:15:25.399]  You could do something.
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:27.001]  If I could do it, you could do it.
[02:15:27.745 --> 02:15:28.285]  Are you kidding me?
[02:15:58.206 --> 02:15:59.909]  You know what makes me cry, Mr. Jones?
[02:16:00.691 --> 02:16:01.752]  You know what makes me cry?
[02:16:04.778 --> 02:16:05.820]  Well, it's the people.
[02:16:06.421 --> 02:16:08.625]  They couldn't do this if we would stand up against it.
[02:16:09.432 --> 02:16:10.972]  It's the people that won't do anything.
[02:16:11.152 --> 02:16:19.874]  Well, actually, they got millions, they sent millions of calls and letters in the last month over this, and they just said, it was 300 and something, it was incredible.
[02:16:20.194 --> 02:16:22.615]  They just said, we don't care, we're going to do it.
[02:16:23.075 --> 02:16:32.877]  You know, it's like 98% in Houston are against the transponder toll roads, and they go, they literally laughed at the people, 93% in Austin, they laughed at us and said, vote us out!
[02:16:32.917 --> 02:16:33.737]  Well, we can't!
[02:16:34.058 --> 02:16:35.678]  Because they got the voting machines in!
[02:16:36.098 --> 02:16:38.859]  Well, Mr. Jones, I'm saying this, not you, and nobody can accuse you.
[02:16:39.099 --> 02:16:41.981]  We're going to have to take back this country, maybe for revolution.
[02:16:43.161 --> 02:16:45.842]  You know, we're going to have to take it back by force.
[02:16:46.103 --> 02:16:48.984]  They know they're going to force people into that, Charles.
[02:16:49.024 --> 02:16:58.868]  That's why they're putting the scanners and the smart dust and the sensors everywhere, and they've got helicopters in every city loaded with knockout gas for whole cities right now.
[02:16:59.208 --> 02:17:00.989]  That's two years old mainstream news.
[02:17:01.309 --> 02:17:03.770]  Mr. Jones, I want to thank you about something.
[02:17:05.498 --> 02:17:11.180]  Precious thing that ever happened to me is when I got in touch with this radio program and you educated me.
[02:17:11.601 --> 02:17:14.602]  And I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:17:15.582 --> 02:17:17.283]  You're really truly American.
[02:17:17.863 --> 02:17:18.363]  Thank you, sir.
[02:17:19.384 --> 02:17:19.984]  Wow, Charles.
[02:17:20.024 --> 02:17:20.584]  God bless you.
[02:17:20.604 --> 02:17:21.345]  What a great guy.
[02:17:22.105 --> 02:17:25.906]  Charles, I've gotten letters and calls from Louisiana where he's doing this and it's had a big effect.
[02:17:27.107 --> 02:17:32.169]  And Charles was convicted of a crime he didn't commit and tortured by police with a bag over his head.
[02:17:32.836 --> 02:17:34.078]  But he's not mad at the police.
[02:17:34.118 --> 02:17:35.560]  He's woken them all up in his area.
[02:17:36.941 --> 02:17:39.024]  And, uh, he's a great guy.
[02:17:39.765 --> 02:17:41.608]  More of you should emulate Charles.
[02:17:42.148 --> 02:17:43.310]  And I want to thank Charles.
[02:17:46.016 --> 02:17:47.757]  By now, you've heard about DirecTV.
[02:17:47.977 --> 02:17:55.882]  You've heard that with DirecTV, you get a better value than cable, a better selection than cable, and access to exclusive programming that you can't get anywhere else.
[02:17:56.103 --> 02:17:58.344]  But for whatever reason, you thought there was a catch.
[02:17:58.624 --> 02:18:00.145]  Maybe even hidden fees.

[02:18:58.634 --> 02:19:03.316]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:19:03.796 --> 02:19:10.522]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:19:10.923 --> 02:19:22.653]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:23.173 --> 02:19:27.635]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:53.684]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[02:19:54.045 --> 02:19:58.728]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[02:19:58.968 --> 02:20:02.810]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[02:20:03.050 --> 02:20:05.992]  Super Silver is a combination of supercharged silver and oxygen.
[02:20:06.312 --> 02:20:13.158]  has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[02:20:13.418 --> 02:20:21.965]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[02:20:22.326 --> 02:20:28.631]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[02:20:47.222 --> 02:20:51.805]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:20:52.146 --> 02:20:54.487]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:20:54.707 --> 02:20:56.228]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:20:56.629 --> 02:21:01.692]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.

[02:21:46.711 --> 02:21:51.854]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.555 --> 02:21:54.856]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:59.179 --> 02:22:02.561]  Alright, Mike, Mary, and others, your calls are coming up.
[02:22:02.621 --> 02:22:04.782]  In fact, Mike, in California, you're on the air.
[02:22:04.882 --> 02:22:05.262]  Welcome.
[02:22:08.924 --> 02:22:10.205]  Good to have you on with us, Mike.
[02:22:10.885 --> 02:22:14.387]  Good morning, or good afternoon, soon to be good afternoon over there.
[02:22:15.107 --> 02:22:24.332]  Um, yeah, I recall, yeah, about, uh, last time about, they suspended me for the, and they got me into a behavioral contract and all that, and I'm pretty sure you know who I am.
[02:22:25.433 --> 02:22:27.494]  Um, well, I have a quick question for you.
[02:22:28.246 --> 02:22:38.774]  Okay, I saw that article on PrisonPlanet.com about how they said that Caucasian boy had that white t-shirt on saying the real terrorists are in the White House.
[02:22:39.475 --> 02:22:44.019]  Well, I have an anti-Bush shirt and they didn't really make no big thing of it.
[02:22:44.099 --> 02:22:47.161]  I mean, I live in a conservative city which is San Diego.
[02:22:49.517 --> 02:22:51.479]  They were going to give me a referral.
[02:22:51.739 --> 02:22:55.121]  I want to know what your thoughts are on dress codes.
[02:22:55.161 --> 02:22:56.282]  Let me give you my thoughts.
[02:22:56.342 --> 02:22:57.663]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[02:22:58.343 --> 02:23:00.105]  I appreciate you calling.
[02:23:01.526 --> 02:23:12.053]  The point is, if there's nothing profane or nothing on the shirt that's along those lines, either you have a dress code or you don't.
[02:23:12.273 --> 02:23:18.077]  The problem is, in schools where there's no real dress code, they just arbitrarily say, I don't like that anti-carry shirt.
[02:23:19.332 --> 02:23:20.753]  I don't like that anti-Bush shirt.
[02:23:21.574 --> 02:23:29.599]  Or the guy in New York, upstate New York, a city lawyer, went in and bought a Peace on Earth t-shirt.
[02:23:29.639 --> 02:23:32.861]  We interviewed him last Christmas.
[02:23:34.122 --> 02:23:35.522]  And they came and arrested him.
[02:23:35.543 --> 02:23:36.963]  They said, get out of here, take the shirt off.
[02:23:37.003 --> 02:23:38.384]  He said, no, I'm going to finish my shopping.
[02:23:38.404 --> 02:23:40.286]  And they said, no, get out of here.
[02:23:41.126 --> 02:23:42.227]  And so they arrested him.
[02:23:43.428 --> 02:23:44.508]  That's the mindset.
[02:23:44.588 --> 02:23:45.869]  Oh, your Peace on Earth shirt.
[02:23:45.989 --> 02:23:46.910]  Oh, you're against the war.
[02:23:47.808 --> 02:23:49.310]  He bought the shirt there at the mall.
[02:23:50.711 --> 02:24:05.464]  So it's, you know, it's like this CBS News executive in Tennessee, allegedly in his email, I've got the email, he won't confirm or deny it, he won't call me back about it, and he says, you know, maybe we're a root of a hate crime.
[02:24:05.845 --> 02:24:08.748]  Criticizing Arnold may be illegal, he's called the FBI on me.
[02:24:10.509 --> 02:24:11.550]  It's this mindset.
[02:24:12.351 --> 02:24:13.392]  Let's talk to Mary.
[02:24:14.193 --> 02:24:16.094]  Mary, where are you listening to us from?
[02:24:16.215 --> 02:24:17.576]  Kansas City, Missouri.
[02:24:17.736 --> 02:24:18.676]  Good to have you on with us.
[02:24:18.696 --> 02:24:19.357]  What's on your mind?
[02:24:19.597 --> 02:24:33.207]  Well, you didn't say this, and the station here only picks you up from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock, but at 12 o'clock they always give a little news break, world news, and it said that England
[02:24:33.777 --> 02:24:39.682]  had said that they saw an attempt for two airplanes to go through two buildings over in England.
[02:24:39.702 --> 02:24:40.623]  Did you hear about that?
[02:24:40.823 --> 02:24:42.184]  Yeah, and it's total propaganda.
[02:24:42.264 --> 02:24:52.112]  Every month or two they claim that they saved the world, and now they're claiming that surveillance technology saved everyone on the eve of the Queen's speech, pushing for all the surveillance.
[02:24:52.252 --> 02:24:53.133]  Could you just hang up?
[02:24:53.213 --> 02:24:53.873]  I'll talk about that.
[02:24:53.913 --> 02:24:54.334]  I don't know.
[02:24:54.354 --> 02:25:01.299]  It just said the planes were ready to go through the buildings like what happened to us on 9-1-1, but it said that the attempts were
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:04.903]  We're caught by their intelligence agency and stopped.
[02:25:05.304 --> 02:25:06.245]  I'm gonna hang up and listen.
[02:25:06.765 --> 02:25:07.867]  Well, thanks for the call.
[02:25:08.427 --> 02:25:19.880]  What we know is, in the past, the British will stage an arrest of one of their Arab informants, they will play the part of a terrorist, and a couple months later, it'll be quietly announced that charges were dropped.
[02:25:21.218 --> 02:25:22.639]  They foiled dirty bombs.
[02:25:22.679 --> 02:25:24.560]  They foiled mass bombings.
[02:25:24.961 --> 02:25:26.121]  They foiled it all.
[02:25:26.342 --> 02:25:38.910]  And with this new case, they supposedly foiled guys that were planning all this because of surveillance technology, because of face scanning cameras that have gone up in the country.
[02:25:39.831 --> 02:25:40.932]  And that's basically it.
[02:25:41.332 --> 02:25:46.936]  And it's very suspicious because it's on the eve of the Queen's speech calling for more of this.
[02:25:48.437 --> 02:25:50.839]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:25:50.899 --> 02:25:51.960]  Who's up next here?
[02:25:53.762 --> 02:25:55.183]  Lori in California.
[02:25:55.203 --> 02:25:56.044]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:25:56.064 --> 02:25:57.425]  Hi, thank you for taking my call.
[02:25:57.865 --> 02:26:00.227]  I just wanted to make a couple quick comments.
[02:26:00.868 --> 02:26:09.996]  One is that every time I call my congressman to talk about the New World Order move, his standard line is, it's a Republican House, it's a Republican Senate, my hands are tied, I can't do anything.
[02:26:10.675 --> 02:26:18.839]  Another one is that... But then you look at it, the Democrats are voting with the Republicans on forced psychological testing, open borders, gun control, all of it.
[02:26:19.359 --> 02:26:20.200]  Exactly, it's insane.
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:30.384]  I'm here in California and everyone was talking about the stem cell research one, props that came up in November, and that's an important one, but I think what a lot of people forgot to look at was Prop 69.
[02:26:31.665 --> 02:26:35.187]  Have you heard about that one where they were taking your DNA for just being arrested?
[02:26:35.527 --> 02:26:35.767]  Yes!
[02:26:37.193 --> 02:26:39.156]  I'd like, you know, a little bit more of your comments on that.
[02:26:39.236 --> 02:26:41.640]  It passed overwhelmingly.
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:48.391]  Now, if you get arrested for driving too fast, they're going to go ahead and take your, quote, tissue.
[02:26:49.293 --> 02:26:51.737]  And it's in Patriot Act 2 to do that.
[02:26:52.515 --> 02:26:59.200]  And they trick the parents in schools into, oh, let us have a DNA test of their cheek tissue so it doesn't cause any bleeding.
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:00.801]  And that goes into a database.
[02:27:00.841 --> 02:27:06.285]  But for 32 years, everyone born in this country in a hospital has the three ampules of blood taken.
[02:27:06.665 --> 02:27:07.986]  One goes into a federal database.
[02:27:08.646 --> 02:27:09.086]  Insane.
[02:27:09.227 --> 02:27:18.293]  I see this because I was at a peace rally last year in San Francisco where they rounded up everybody, like 200 people, arrested them, and then let them all go.
[02:27:18.313 --> 02:27:19.734]  But under those circumstances... Tell you what, Laurie.
[02:27:19.754 --> 02:27:20.254]  Laurie, stay there.
[02:27:20.294 --> 02:27:21.555]  We'll talk more about it on the other side.
[02:27:22.509 --> 02:27:24.571]  I'm gonna talk to Rick, and then that's it for calls.
[02:27:25.712 --> 02:27:27.473]  Because I'm gonna cover a bunch of news.
[02:27:27.854 --> 02:27:29.215]  Two more calls, then the news.
[02:27:29.235 --> 02:27:34.940]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.841 --> 02:27:36.742]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.222 --> 02:27:38.843]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.864 --> 02:27:42.447]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.499 --> 02:27:51.064]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glasser, a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:27:51.184 --> 02:27:52.426]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[02:27:52.606 --> 02:27:53.166]  Thank you, Marvin.
[02:27:53.367 --> 02:27:56.710]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[02:27:56.890 --> 02:27:57.411]  Is that true?
[02:27:57.651 --> 02:27:58.632]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[02:27:58.672 --> 02:28:01.636]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[02:28:01.716 --> 02:28:01.916]  price.
[02:28:02.156 --> 02:28:04.238]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[02:28:04.278 --> 02:28:05.019]  They're very common.
[02:28:05.099 --> 02:28:08.283]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[02:28:08.323 --> 02:28:08.583]  price.
[02:28:08.863 --> 02:28:10.004]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[02:28:10.024 --> 02:28:12.447]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[02:28:12.667 --> 02:28:16.471]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[02:28:16.491 --> 02:28:16.771]  price.
[02:28:17.152 --> 02:28:19.534]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[02:28:19.815 --> 02:28:21.817]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[02:28:21.857 --> 02:28:23.879]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[02:28:24.119 --> 02:28:29.044]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll free number for your information package.

[02:28:45.788 --> 02:28:47.409]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.549 --> 02:28:51.630]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.790 --> 02:28:54.671]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.751 --> 02:29:01.473]  The powerful Black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.653 --> 02:29:04.654]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:04.854 --> 02:29:07.255]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.375 --> 02:29:15.258]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:29:15.578 --> 02:29:15.718]  Well,
[02:29:46.027 --> 02:29:51.589]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:29:51.829 --> 02:29:52.869]  You use deodorant, right?
[02:29:53.089 --> 02:29:53.950]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:29:54.130 --> 02:29:56.730]  You obviously wear it to cover up the embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:29:56.970 --> 02:30:01.812]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:30:02.052 --> 02:30:03.053]  Check out this new product.
[02:30:03.233 --> 02:30:06.196]  It's called No-B-O and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:30:06.516 --> 02:30:10.500]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:13.682]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[02:30:13.823 --> 02:30:19.588]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:30:19.768 --> 02:30:21.149]  Now, she wants to share it with you.
[02:30:21.449 --> 02:30:22.190]  Still not convinced?
[02:30:22.470 --> 02:30:22.831]  Try it.
[02:30:22.951 --> 02:30:23.331]  Go ahead.
[02:30:23.471 --> 02:30:24.172]  Try No-BO.
[02:30:24.312 --> 02:30:26.374]  It comes with a 100% money back offer.
[02:30:26.554 --> 02:30:29.577]  No-BO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[02:30:29.697 --> 02:30:32.860]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-BO.
[02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:35.542]  Check out their website at NO-BO.com.
[02:30:35.722 --> 02:30:37.864]  Type NO-BO.com.
[02:30:38.044 --> 02:30:38.405]  Come on.
[02:30:38.585 --> 02:30:41.688]  It's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-BO.
[02:30:41.828 --> 02:30:42.188]  Call 888-881-NO-BO.
[02:30:55.726 --> 02:31:03.834]  Alright, we're taking two more calls and I'm going to plunge into all the news we haven't gotten to and have a quick recap of some of the top stories that those of you out there that just tuned in may have missed.
[02:31:05.195 --> 02:31:10.040]  Lori in California, yeah, DNA testing if you're arrested for parking tickets for any reason.
[02:31:12.082 --> 02:31:15.905]  Massive stem cell research, that is baby parts, which Arnold's all for, of course.
[02:31:16.746 --> 02:31:20.810]  What do you think of the movement out there to get him to be able to run for president?
[02:31:21.917 --> 02:31:22.917]  So, so scary.
[02:31:22.937 --> 02:31:32.341]  You know, I thought that because we lived in California, we're a little more used to the star kind of movie star kind of thing, you know, but everyone here just fell right into it.
[02:31:32.401 --> 02:31:42.445]  And so many of my friends that, you know, are open to this New World Order stuff just voted for him because they wanted the feeling of the power to get rid of Gray Davis.
[02:31:43.038 --> 02:31:52.665]  You know, Davis, that was our... And they're going to pull some kind of scam like that with him against Hillary or something, and even the LA Times admits he's already running for president, already raising money.
[02:31:52.685 --> 02:31:53.926]  Oh, yeah.
[02:31:53.966 --> 02:31:57.928]  I mean, he does this over and over and over again, and when you ask if he is, he says he's not.
[02:31:58.749 --> 02:32:00.871]  Have you checked out ArnoldExposed.com yet?
[02:32:00.891 --> 02:32:01.351]  I love it!
[02:32:01.371 --> 02:32:07.175]  You know, that one day last week I heard you, and you were really promoting the site, the very next day in our local newspaper, the Sentinel here,
[02:32:07.628 --> 02:32:14.611]  Picked up and just said really great things about you and talked about your site and about your organization and stuff like that, what we're doing.
[02:32:14.631 --> 02:32:15.152]  Really?
[02:32:15.212 --> 02:32:16.152]  I didn't see that article.
[02:32:16.192 --> 02:32:17.593]  It was different than the AP article?
[02:32:19.020 --> 02:32:21.261]  Yeah, it must have been, yeah, because I was really proud of him.
[02:32:21.301 --> 02:32:29.905]  Like, guys, they're stoking him, they're not insulting him, they're, you know, commending him and his documentaries and showing that he had a long history of, you know, credible information and stuff.
[02:32:29.925 --> 02:32:30.685]  It was really good.
[02:32:30.905 --> 02:32:31.906]  My goodness!
[02:32:32.346 --> 02:32:34.767]  I want to know about that so we can post it so others can read it.
[02:32:34.947 --> 02:32:38.609]  Oh, I'll have to dig it out of the newspapers and send it over, email it to you or something.
[02:32:39.449 --> 02:32:41.390]  Well, I just, I'm looking for a pin, of course.
[02:32:41.410 --> 02:32:43.731]  It must have fallen.
[02:32:44.961 --> 02:32:46.262]  Off my broadcast desk.
[02:32:46.302 --> 02:32:47.242]  What newspaper was that?
[02:32:47.342 --> 02:32:49.343]  It was the Sentinel in Santa Cruz, California.
[02:32:50.183 --> 02:32:54.546]  Sentinel in Santa Cruz, Cal.
[02:32:54.746 --> 02:32:55.426]  And what day was that?
[02:32:56.229 --> 02:32:59.631]  Gosh, I think it was on a Thursday or Friday.
[02:33:00.112 --> 02:33:01.813]  The day after you were pushing it really hard.
[02:33:01.893 --> 02:33:03.614]  It must have been Friday.
[02:33:03.794 --> 02:33:05.315]  I mean, I don't care about being in a newspaper.
[02:33:05.375 --> 02:33:15.922]  The reason I'm excited about separate articles, San Antonio Express News and a bunch of others, is that we post them and then millions of people see those, too, and it just causes more media attention to what we're doing.
[02:33:15.942 --> 02:33:17.823]  So it was a positive article, though.
[02:33:18.083 --> 02:33:18.964]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:33:19.955 --> 02:33:22.816]  And it even said that I've done a bunch of other stuff.
[02:33:22.836 --> 02:33:23.296]  Well, that's good.
[02:33:23.476 --> 02:33:24.036]  Exactly.
[02:33:24.176 --> 02:33:24.376]  Yep.
[02:33:24.916 --> 02:33:26.177]  They must know the truth about Arnold.
[02:33:26.217 --> 02:33:31.538]  I mean, people I talk to, print reporters, are in horror of this guy because they're actually doing research.
[02:33:32.038 --> 02:33:35.679]  But then when I talk to these talk show hosts, even liberal ones, they're like, we love him!
[02:33:35.799 --> 02:33:36.259]  Shut up!
[02:33:36.299 --> 02:33:36.980]  You're bad!
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:40.200]  It's like, do you know how bad this guy is?
[02:33:41.061 --> 02:33:42.101]  Yep, he is awful.
[02:33:42.754 --> 02:33:44.196]  We're trying to educate our community.
[02:33:44.556 --> 02:33:52.264]  And, you know, the rest of the country who aren't used to stars and stuff like that, just like what I heard you say, you know, earlier about they're just going to push him through just like Reagan.
[02:33:52.304 --> 02:33:56.629]  He's a star, you know, and he's got all this charisma and he's paid to act.
[02:33:57.269 --> 02:34:00.092]  So, you know, I hope that the rest of the country starts to wake up.
[02:34:00.192 --> 02:34:02.595]  And thanks for your site about Arnold Exposed.
[02:34:02.695 --> 02:34:03.216]  It's a good one.
[02:34:03.636 --> 02:34:04.297]  Well, thank you.
[02:34:04.317 --> 02:34:04.957]  Good to hear from you.
[02:34:04.977 --> 02:34:05.398]  Keep it up.
[02:34:06.232 --> 02:34:08.861]  Before we go to our final caller, Rick, I'm honored to have her.
[02:34:08.881 --> 02:34:09.723]  She's Debbie Morrow.
[02:34:09.763 --> 02:34:10.827]  Haven't had her on in a few weeks.
[02:34:11.248 --> 02:34:12.532]  New Millennium Concepts.
[02:34:13.547 --> 02:34:19.092]  And they got the best gravity-filled water purification systems, bar none, made right here in America.
[02:34:19.452 --> 02:34:21.534]  They also have the British version, if you want that one too.
[02:34:21.594 --> 02:34:22.395]  Some people like that one.
[02:34:22.775 --> 02:34:23.676]  I like the black one.
[02:34:24.737 --> 02:34:25.678]  It's a great system.
[02:34:25.698 --> 02:34:26.819]  Got a lot of great specials.
[02:34:26.859 --> 02:34:32.764]  And to announce new holiday, I'll commit a thought crime here, Christmas specials, is Debbie Morrow.
[02:34:32.804 --> 02:34:33.685]  Debbie, good to be on with us.
[02:34:33.705 --> 02:34:34.045]  Good to have you.
[02:34:34.065 --> 02:34:34.686]  Hi, Alex.
[02:34:34.766 --> 02:34:35.867]  Thanks for having me.
[02:34:35.967 --> 02:34:40.130]  I missed you guys last week while I was sunning on the beach in California.
[02:34:41.371 --> 02:34:43.351]  But I hope you all had a wonderful week.
[02:34:44.472 --> 02:35:00.715]  The reason I wanted to call in today especially was to talk to you and your listeners about the holiday specials that we're going to have before they go out and spend all their money the day after Thanksgiving, which is usually the busiest shopping day of the year.
[02:35:01.395 --> 02:35:06.896]  We wanted to remind people that the best gift you can give your friends and your family is the gift of health.
[02:35:07.994 --> 02:35:12.447]  And so for that reason we've come up with some Christmas specials that we'd like to
[02:35:13.365 --> 02:35:15.126]  Not Christmas, holiday specials.
[02:35:15.586 --> 02:35:18.047]  Yeah, don't commit a thought crime.
[02:35:18.507 --> 02:35:19.588]  I'm sorry!
[02:35:19.608 --> 02:35:21.389]  Debbie, you've done other bad things.
[02:35:21.849 --> 02:35:24.610]  New Millennium Concepts, this is made in America.
[02:35:24.890 --> 02:35:25.571]  I know.
[02:35:26.991 --> 02:35:28.952]  This is really bad stuff.
[02:35:28.992 --> 02:35:30.093]  Tell us about the new specials.
[02:35:30.333 --> 02:35:31.233]  I would love to.
[02:35:31.493 --> 02:35:39.417]  What we'd like to do is encourage people to buy multiple Berkies so that they can give them as gifts to loved ones.
[02:35:40.970 --> 02:35:41.730]  Things like that.
[02:35:41.890 --> 02:35:46.311]  And so, of course, with the Berkey Light without lights, you get one free gift.
[02:35:47.071 --> 02:35:52.672]  But, if you buy two of them, instead of getting two free gifts, you get three free gifts.
[02:35:53.673 --> 02:35:57.413]  And if you buy three of them, instead of getting three free gifts, you get six.
[02:35:58.714 --> 02:36:02.734]  And if you buy four, then instead of getting four free gifts, you get ten free gifts.
[02:36:03.354 --> 02:36:05.855]  And the same thing goes for if you get the Berkey Light
[02:36:07.023 --> 02:36:08.625]  Without the lights.
[02:36:09.286 --> 02:36:14.893]  And by the way, the free gifts are things like the video or DVD, Sheltering in Place, How to Truly Make Your House Safe by a U.S.
[02:36:14.913 --> 02:36:25.266]  Government Expert, or The Prudent Places, 500 plus color maps, population numbers, crop numbers, yield, it's an incredible thing to have.
[02:36:26.386 --> 02:36:34.450]  You've got sports filters that make the water safe to drink out of creeks or ponds or tap water that do 600 refills.
[02:36:34.750 --> 02:36:40.072]  Plus, you've got potassium iodide in case there's a radiological event.
[02:36:40.112 --> 02:36:41.993]  You take it and it protects your thyroid.
[02:36:42.013 --> 02:36:44.434]  The number one cause of death is thyroid poisoning.
[02:36:44.774 --> 02:36:46.554]  So, how do those specials work?
[02:36:46.855 --> 02:36:54.378]  Well, how they work is, of course, they call me and if they decide they want to get two Berkey Lights with lights.
[02:36:55.018 --> 02:36:55.298]  Okay?
[02:36:55.956 --> 02:37:10.040]  They would get five free gifts, and so not only are they getting the Berkey Light one for themselves, one to give away, but they're also getting maybe five sport bottles to give away as stocking stuffers, trade gifts, things like that.
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:20.563]  And I did want to remind people that we do have the Berkey Sport Bottle Specials, that you can get five Berkey Sport Bottle generic labeled ones for $99, or you can get 12 for $200.
[02:37:23.911 --> 02:37:26.458]  Those make great gifts.
[02:37:26.759 --> 02:37:31.672]  And again, right now, a month into it, the water in Austin tastes like sewer water.
[02:37:31.692 --> 02:37:32.855]  They admit there's stuff in it.
[02:37:33.522 --> 02:37:34.943]  It's never tasted like this.
[02:37:36.144 --> 02:37:39.507]  You put it through a sports bottle, the bad taste is gone.
[02:37:39.848 --> 02:37:42.730]  Put it through a Berkey purifier, everything is gone.
[02:37:43.290 --> 02:37:49.156]  The Berkey Sport just makes it safe to drink right out of ponds, creeks, rivers, puddles, you name it.
[02:37:49.256 --> 02:37:50.857]  Give Debbie a call 1-888-803-4438-888-803-4438
[02:38:00.385 --> 02:38:06.167]  Or go to Berkeywater.com, tell them it's an Alex Jones special, and in the comments section, tell them what free gifts you want.
[02:38:06.187 --> 02:38:09.669]  If you call and the phone's busy or it goes to voicemail, leave your name and number.
[02:38:09.709 --> 02:38:11.409]  Debbie, we'll call you right back.
[02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.910]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:38:11.930 --> 02:38:14.531]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[02:38:14.551 --> 02:38:15.311]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:38:15.531 --> 02:38:16.251]  Talk to you soon.
[02:38:16.751 --> 02:38:19.452]  Good to hear from you.
[02:38:19.953 --> 02:38:20.313]  You bet.
[02:38:20.373 --> 02:38:22.654]  Let's talk to Rick in Baltimore, Maryland.
[02:38:22.694 --> 02:38:23.274]  Last caller.
[02:38:23.314 --> 02:38:23.874]  Go ahead, Rick.
[02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:24.614]  Hi, Alex.
[02:38:24.674 --> 02:38:25.955]  I have two quick questions.
[02:38:26.391 --> 02:38:30.313]  One is, last week I thought I heard you say that Atlanta was going to be the new U.S.
[02:38:30.353 --> 02:38:30.773]  Capitol.
[02:38:30.973 --> 02:38:31.434]  Is that true?
[02:38:31.514 --> 02:38:32.494]  And if so, when?
[02:38:33.335 --> 02:38:33.555]  No.
[02:38:34.755 --> 02:38:35.536]  Okay.
[02:38:35.736 --> 02:38:39.298]  Denver has been prepared for the new emergency capitol.
[02:38:40.939 --> 02:38:46.802]  After they have, if there's a real nuking or something, they'll first move an emergency cabinet to Camp David.
[02:38:47.882 --> 02:38:53.605]  An alternate of that will be there in Denver, and a new capitol will be built there if there's ever a problem.
[02:38:53.645 --> 02:38:54.126]  That's public.
[02:38:55.928 --> 02:39:07.613]  The Pan-American Union, or Union of American States Capital, they have agreed upon, years ago, to have it in Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:39:08.493 --> 02:39:11.594]  And now there's some debate, they might change it to Miami, but it looks like Atlanta.
[02:39:12.535 --> 02:39:13.435]  Okay, alright, thank you.
[02:39:13.735 --> 02:39:23.739]  The other question was, if the Illuminati went to all the trouble to have all the royals killed in the revolutions, only to have them ruled 200 years later, what's the point of that?
[02:39:24.565 --> 02:39:41.335]  No, the Illuminati targeted certain royal families, like one royal would target his cousin, say, out of England into France, or out of Germany into France, or out of Austria into Poland, or out of Austria into Russia, using the Illuminati.
[02:39:41.355 --> 02:39:48.979]  It seemed to happen so quickly, since the Illuminati was formed, and they had these revolutions shortly thereafter.
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:53.302]  Yes, but those turned into revolutions against the people.
[02:39:56.022 --> 02:39:58.042]  I mean, it's just history.
[02:39:59.203 --> 02:40:04.303]  I mean, you know that the British targeted with the Communists their cousins, the Tsars.
[02:40:04.343 --> 02:40:05.644]  They were like first cousins.
[02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:10.625]  The King of Russia and the King of England couldn't be told apart.
[02:40:10.665 --> 02:40:12.945]  They looked like twins at that time.
[02:40:13.585 --> 02:40:15.285]  They just took advantage of existing feuds?
[02:40:16.986 --> 02:40:17.466]  Well, no.
[02:40:17.766 --> 02:40:21.886]  The Illuminati was funded by certain key royal families.
[02:40:26.857 --> 02:40:28.818]  I'll have to do some more reading then, I'm bugging on that.
[02:40:29.419 --> 02:40:30.620]  Alright, what else is on your mind?
[02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:37.885]  Um, I have some oral information, but it's... It's, uh... I think I better write you a letter on that.
[02:40:39.566 --> 02:40:44.810]  Yeah, I don't want to talk about anything we can't absolutely confirm, but what did you notice, Schwarzenegger?
[02:40:45.311 --> 02:40:53.417]  Well, it's something, it would take too much of your time going on the air about it, but I can write you a letter and just let you know where to look and some names.
[02:40:56.044 --> 02:40:58.725]  You wouldn't believe who I've been contacted by in the last two days.
[02:41:00.225 --> 02:41:06.327]  Oh, yeah, there's a lot of people that you probably hear from and may still hear from in the future.
[02:41:07.968 --> 02:41:11.029]  Yeah, I knew the Elite had big plans for Arnold.
[02:41:11.109 --> 02:41:19.612]  I wrote an article about it a year ago, a year plus, but now getting into this, I know I'm on to the heart of the matter.
[02:41:19.972 --> 02:41:23.753]  I mean, they've got big plans for this guy and we've got to stop it.
[02:41:24.674 --> 02:41:25.554]  Yeah, you're right, you're right.
[02:41:26.474 --> 02:41:27.615]  Okay, well, thanks very much.
[02:41:27.915 --> 02:41:31.018]  Hey, I appreciate the call, Rick, and be sure and write me that letter.
[02:41:31.359 --> 02:41:31.959]  Okay, will do.
[02:41:31.979 --> 02:41:32.780]  Appreciate it.
[02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:35.783]  Okay, let's plunge into the news now.
[02:41:36.223 --> 02:41:38.966]  Smart Dust may soon be watching you.
[02:41:40.707 --> 02:41:45.251]  King 5 Television out of Seattle, Washington.
[02:41:46.112 --> 02:41:50.096]  It's a project first dreamed up by the military to get information from the battlefield.
[02:41:50.959 --> 02:41:56.400]  They call it SmartDust, and it may soon make it possible to track anything, anywhere, including you.
[02:41:57.300 --> 02:41:59.921]  They are the world's smallest wireless sensors.
[02:42:01.201 --> 02:42:17.624]  At about the size of a wristwatch, they contain a battery-powered microphone and an accelerometer, as well as a temperature and humidity sensors, according to Sam Goodwin, the Vice President of Crossbow.
[02:42:18.775 --> 02:42:24.699]  Scatter them 250 feet apart and they will form their own wireless network, similar to a spider's web.
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:35.027]  SmartDust was first designed for the military, enabling troops to crop dust enemy lines with millions of networked wireless sensors, too small to see and too numerous to destroy.
[02:42:35.567 --> 02:42:37.929]  We have our RFID, you can put a hundred of them on the tip of your finger.
[02:42:38.689 --> 02:42:43.773]  They can be used to track enemy troops, or where a gunshot is coming from.
[02:42:45.327 --> 02:42:52.053]  Through a contact with the Pentagon, researchers invented SmartDust at the University of California in the late 90s.
[02:42:52.273 --> 02:43:01.061]  I coined the name SmartDust to describe where all of this was headed, said Chris... I can't say his name on the radio.
[02:43:01.121 --> 02:43:07.606]  It's kind of like that Meet the Parents movie.
[02:43:07.746 --> 02:43:10.068]  Chief Technology Officer for DustWorks.
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:19.527]  He said an internal prototype as small as a grain of rice and was able to sense, talk, and listen.
[02:43:20.128 --> 02:43:26.895]  SmartDust has enormous potential to improve lives and offer high-tech, inexpensive ways to monitor a pipeline in Auburn.
[02:43:27.336 --> 02:43:34.464]  Securing the perimeters of a jail, monitoring the nuclear power plant in Hartford, or sensing vibration on Tacoma narrow bridges.
[02:43:35.410 --> 02:43:37.491]  Even monitor children at daycare centers.
[02:43:37.551 --> 02:43:41.313]  But privacy experts warn that smart dust is a potential dark side.
[02:43:41.653 --> 02:43:44.194]  Imagine living in a city coated with wireless sensors.
[02:43:45.094 --> 02:43:50.177]  In the futuristic movie Minority Report, even billboards seem to know the identity of people passing by.
[02:43:51.837 --> 02:43:52.998]  Folks, it isn't coming.
[02:43:53.038 --> 02:43:56.079]  They put up face scanning cameras everywhere.
[02:43:57.160 --> 02:43:59.701]  License plate scanning cameras everywhere.
[02:44:00.601 --> 02:44:03.622]  They're going to make you take transponders and satellite track boxes.
[02:44:04.303 --> 02:44:04.823]  It's all
[02:44:05.549 --> 02:44:08.010]  happening right now.
[02:44:08.170 --> 02:44:09.491]  It's the real deal.
[02:44:09.911 --> 02:44:10.572]  Here's another one.
[02:44:12.893 --> 02:44:13.814]  Yahoo News.
[02:44:13.934 --> 02:44:17.716]  Government uses color laser printer technology to track documents.
[02:44:19.137 --> 02:44:26.060]  Next time you make a printout from your color laser printer, shot an LED flashlight beam on it and examine it closely for a magnifying glass.
[02:44:27.681 --> 02:44:34.285]  You may be able to see the small scattered yellow dot printer there that could be used to trace the document back to you.
[02:44:35.137 --> 02:44:43.920]  According to experts, several printer companies quietly encoded the serial number and the manufacturing code of their color laser printers and color copiers on every document those machines produced.
[02:44:44.361 --> 02:44:48.162]  Governments, including the United States, already use the hidden markings to track counterfeiters.
[02:44:49.062 --> 02:45:02.607]  Peter Crean, a sensor research fellow at Xerox, says the company's laser printers, copiers, and multi-function workstations, such as the WorkCenter Pro Series, put the serial number of each machine code into little yellow dots in every printout.
[02:45:02.668 --> 02:45:03.728]  The millimeter-sized dots
[02:45:05.220 --> 02:45:09.322]  appear about every inch on the page, nestled within the printed words and margins.
[02:45:11.022 --> 02:45:13.803]  It's a trail back to you like a license plate, Crean says.
[02:45:16.044 --> 02:45:20.306]  And it goes on to say crime fighting, how great it is, just everything's great, folks.
[02:45:21.747 --> 02:45:22.747]  Here's the article I had.
[02:45:22.767 --> 02:45:32.871]  I had an article I wanted to read to you about fast forwarding and rewinding your VCR is going to be
[02:45:35.086 --> 02:45:35.426]  Criminal.
[02:45:36.487 --> 02:45:37.567]  Trying to find it right now.
[02:45:39.168 --> 02:45:40.448]  Just had it here in the stack.
[02:45:40.648 --> 02:45:41.909]  I read part of it earlier.
[02:45:42.669 --> 02:45:44.170]  We're trying to pass a bill through Congress.
[02:45:45.010 --> 02:45:47.371]  I'm not joking anymore.
[02:45:48.192 --> 02:45:51.253]  La Raza confirms Gonzales is one of their members.
[02:45:52.874 --> 02:45:57.156]  National Council of La Raza confirms that Alberto Gonzales is one of their members.
[02:45:57.656 --> 02:46:00.317]  Those of us in border states know the slogan of this group.
[02:46:01.097 --> 02:46:02.778]  For those within the race, everything.
[02:46:02.838 --> 02:46:04.499]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[02:46:05.498 --> 02:46:06.179]  Again, there's a slogan.
[02:46:06.519 --> 02:46:07.960]  For those within the race, everything.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:09.561]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[02:46:10.642 --> 02:46:16.746]  The definition of the race, of course, is Hispanics, Latinos, Chicanos, or whatever their current name de jure is.
[02:46:17.247 --> 02:46:21.890]  Sure, a white candidate to be a member of the Ku Klux Klan or other white supremacist group.
[02:46:22.591 --> 02:46:25.253]  The National Council of La Raza would scream in outrage.
[02:46:25.873 --> 02:46:31.097]  Seems they believe that racists come in only one color, white.
[02:46:32.651 --> 02:46:37.073]  Contact your two Senators and tell them no, no, no to Alberto Gonzales.
[02:46:37.193 --> 02:46:39.334]  It just goes on and on.
[02:46:39.914 --> 02:46:47.457]  They have a press release here from the National Council of La Raza, the largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the U.S.
[02:46:47.477 --> 02:46:51.879]  today, welcomed it and said we're very encouraged because he's a La Raza member.
[02:46:52.439 --> 02:46:54.700]  He's also for open borders, gun control, and abortion.
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:56.161]  Ha!
[02:46:56.281 --> 02:46:56.421]  Ha!
[02:46:56.561 --> 02:46:56.701]  Ha!
[02:46:57.321 --> 02:46:58.862]  Oh man, I tell you we're in trouble.
[02:46:59.562 --> 02:47:02.143]  Dollar hits new lows versus the Euro.
[02:47:03.129 --> 02:47:11.415]  The dollar slumped again today after news that Russia may increase its share of Euros in its reserves, drove the European unit to a new lifetime high, $1.31+.
[02:47:12.236 --> 02:47:26.327]  Let me see, the Euro two years ago was trading at 89 cents against the dollar, so 11 cents, 30, 41, 42, 42 plus cents.
[02:47:29.029 --> 02:47:32.392]  The dollar's down on it, so your money's devalued by 40 plus percent.
[02:47:32.412 --> 02:47:32.992]  I hope you enjoy it.
[02:47:33.732 --> 02:47:35.713]  Average person has no idea what I'm even talking about.
[02:47:35.753 --> 02:47:36.634]  I'm not trying to be elitist.
[02:47:36.694 --> 02:47:40.156]  It scares me that this is such a basic thing to have worthless money.
[02:47:41.317 --> 02:47:43.118]  And now all the inflation's starting up.
[02:47:43.198 --> 02:47:45.859]  And again, the average yuppie doesn't care.
[02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:47.220]  Here it is.
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:47.701]  I found it.
[02:47:47.841 --> 02:47:48.641]  NBC News.
[02:47:48.821 --> 02:47:52.463]  Bill can criminalize fast-forwarding DVD ads and trailers.
[02:47:53.304 --> 02:47:56.006]  See, what these yuppies do is they stick their finger up in the wind.
[02:47:56.646 --> 02:48:01.649]  Whatever they think the general public's going with, whatever they think the establishment's going with, they just do it.
[02:48:02.597 --> 02:48:04.257]  So it doesn't care if we're all against this stuff.
[02:48:04.698 --> 02:48:07.998]  The people you're going to hear on the radio and TV and in print are all going to say it's great, see?
[02:48:08.238 --> 02:48:09.779]  Because they know that's how they keep their jobs.
[02:48:11.159 --> 02:48:12.159]  They don't care about their families.
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:17.221]  They don't understand that if they just started standing up and saying no, they can't fire everybody.
[02:48:18.521 --> 02:48:24.022]  A new bill before Congress may eventually have DVD viewers thinking twice before fast forwarding through the ads and previews.
[02:48:24.482 --> 02:48:30.944]  The proposed legislation would make fast forwarding through those ads illegal, not only in theaters, but also at home, NBC News reported.
[02:48:31.826 --> 02:48:33.289]  Tell you about this and some other stuff.
[02:48:33.730 --> 02:48:35.754]  News Blitz coming up in the final segment.
[02:48:35.834 --> 02:48:40.163]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.TV, and now ArnoldExposed.com.
[02:48:40.664 --> 02:48:43.230]  Please spread the word and help us defend the Republic!
[02:48:46.610 --> 02:48:53.994]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.274 --> 02:48:58.997]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:59.237 --> 02:49:04.880]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:05.100 --> 02:49:09.662]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:09.922 --> 02:49:17.005]  Attached was society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:17.045 --> 02:49:17.845]  soil, the U.S.A.
[02:49:17.865 --> 02:49:21.527]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.727 --> 02:49:24.248]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.468 --> 02:49:31.191]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:49:31.411 --> 02:49:36.554]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-88-8-8-2-2-2-5-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[02:49:36.594 --> 02:49:36.814]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:45.746 --> 02:49:50.971]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.111 --> 02:49:59.200]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.460 --> 02:50:06.507]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.687 --> 02:50:07.967]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:50:08.047 --> 02:50:13.948]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.128 --> 02:50:19.229]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.329 --> 02:50:28.211]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.471 --> 02:50:31.772]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:50:33.872 --> 02:50:34.712]  We're good to go!
[02:51:01.926 --> 02:51:02.567]  We're good to go.

[02:51:34.685 --> 02:51:40.548]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:54.557 --> 02:52:01.185]  So, uh, they've introduced the bill, got the article at prisonplanet.com to make it illegal to fast forward or rewind, uh, over ads.
[02:52:02.005 --> 02:52:02.927]  Fast forward past them.
[02:52:03.647 --> 02:52:08.312]  And your digital cable box is gonna track you along with your TiVo, don't come out in a rush, uh, NBC News.
[02:52:08.473 --> 02:52:08.993]  Okay, now.
[02:52:09.754 --> 02:52:13.178]  Uh, Doctors Group, uh, fights prescription drugs reporting bill.
[02:52:14.199 --> 02:52:14.740]  Newsmax.
[02:52:15.583 --> 02:52:18.487]  Do you want the government to have a record of every prescription you get?
[02:52:18.587 --> 02:52:20.189]  They already do it, now they're making it the law.
[02:52:20.790 --> 02:52:26.637]  Ask the Association and its campaign of flyers and emails reaching out to physicians and their patients around the country.
[02:52:26.657 --> 02:52:29.601]  Again, that's the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[02:52:30.356 --> 02:52:38.603]  Every painkiller, every antidepressant, every sleeping pill, and then to pass that information along to law enforcement to prosecute you and your doctor if they don't like what they find?
[02:52:38.623 --> 02:52:51.694]  AAPS is arguing that while masquerading as a law enforcement tool to help control the illegal use of painkillers, the national bill would cast a net so wide that tens of millions of suffering patients and doctors will be snared in suspicion.
[02:52:53.047 --> 02:52:54.889]  No limit to prescriptions or painkillers.
[02:52:55.329 --> 02:53:01.635]  Adds, the bill would create a central database affecting tens of millions who are on every type of drug you can imagine.
[02:53:03.716 --> 02:53:04.237]  More freedom.
[02:53:05.438 --> 02:53:10.002]  A proposal would tax drivers on how much they drive LA Times yesterday.
[02:53:12.006 --> 02:53:24.729]  It says, tax motorists, based on the number of miles they drive, the concept is gaining currency among the think-outside-the-box crowd as a way to bolster sagging transportation covers while eliminating the politically unpopular tax on gasoline.
[02:53:24.769 --> 02:53:24.969]  Yeah.
[02:53:25.509 --> 02:53:32.591]  And they admitted in the proposal last week, 25 cents a mile instead of 18 cents a gallon.
[02:53:33.151 --> 02:53:37.452]  And again, you get 20 plus miles a gallon on average, so that's 18 cents versus 25 times
[02:53:42.483 --> 02:53:42.703]  That.
[02:53:43.304 --> 02:53:43.964]  Again, do the math.
[02:53:44.464 --> 02:53:44.985]  It's simple.
[02:53:45.585 --> 02:53:52.370]  Would you rather pay 18 cents on a gallon, or pay 25 cents for every mile you drive, timesing that 20 times?
[02:53:54.051 --> 02:53:59.455]  It comes out to $6 on one side, under their proposal, and 18 cents under the old system.
[02:54:00.315 --> 02:54:05.639]  And they also say that it's being done, this is all over, because they don't get as much money.
[02:54:05.719 --> 02:54:11.203]  Well, we used 22 million barrels a day instead of 18 million barrels that we were using just five years ago.
[02:54:12.099 --> 02:54:13.100]  They're raising more money!
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:15.281]  They claim there's no money, we gotta do this.
[02:54:16.222 --> 02:54:17.443]  Because of fuel-efficient cars.
[02:54:17.643 --> 02:54:18.423]  Totally made up.
[02:54:19.844 --> 02:54:28.410]  It's absolutely horrible, said Nancy Muslin, an artist who drives, who divides her time in her drives between downtown Los Angeles and Newport Beach.
[02:54:29.170 --> 02:54:34.394]  It's the craziest idea I've ever heard, said Judy Hesser, who manages a gas station in North Hollywood.
