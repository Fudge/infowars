[00:00:05.691 --> 00:00:06.331]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:08.031]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.771 --> 00:00:09.872]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.532 --> 00:00:11.332]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.092 --> 00:00:13.012]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:17.453]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:21.914]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:32.949]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:34.890]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.772]  It is Monday, the 23rd of February, 2004.
[00:00:39.912 --> 00:00:42.274]  Two days until The Passion of Christ comes out.
[00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:47.657]  I'll be there on Wednesday afternoon watching it and giving you my report on Thursday.
[00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:51.759]  I apologize for not being here last Thursday and Friday.
[00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.840]  I normally do the show when I am sick.
[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.200]  I'm rarely sick.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.841]  I thought I had a cold last week.
[00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:58.062]  It turned into the flu.
[00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:58.742]  104 temperature.
[00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:04.940]  Let's just say I was not a happy camper, so I could not do the show.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.201]  But I am here totally recuperated.
[00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.142]  In fact, there was some good side effects.
[00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:11.102]  I'm off coffee.
[00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:14.884]  I said, hey, I haven't had coffee in three or four days.
[00:01:14.984 --> 00:01:16.385]  Why drink coffee now?
[00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:17.325]  So I'm off coffee.
[00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:22.067]  So I guess the only drugs I use now are occasional Tylenol.
[00:01:23.908 --> 00:01:27.711]  And I lost 10 pounds while I was sick, so I'm even more handsome now.
[00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:30.473]  Okay, I've never had more to talk about.
[00:01:30.853 --> 00:01:34.356]  Just an absolutely gigantic, ultra-massive show.
[00:01:36.157 --> 00:01:40.180]  Coming up in the next hour, folks, you're not going to want to miss this.
[00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:47.906]  We have a very interesting individual coming on the show, Michael Shrimpton, a national security barrister.
[00:01:48.923 --> 00:01:53.347]  He's written for the Journal of International Security Affairs.
[00:01:53.467 --> 00:02:01.974]  He has briefed the United States Senate Committee on Intelligence and a lot more.
[00:02:01.994 --> 00:02:03.615]  A lengthy bio.
[00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:07.738]  You can just type his name in online and see a lot of the big cases he's been involved in.
[00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.862]  He's traveled all over the Western world and given speeches and consulted on terrorism.
[00:02:14.203 --> 00:02:16.205]  Guess why he's joining us on the show?
[00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:28.388]  Well, last week you may have seen a story floating around that somebody inside the British government had sources that said that they could confirm that Dr. David Kelly had been killed.
[00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:32.489]  We've already got all these top doctors and scientists coming forward and saying that.
[00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:37.051]  We've got all the evidence and even mainstream headlines saying, is this what happened?
[00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:44.674]  Well, he's got sources inside MI5, MI6, and from the information he has, they know how
[00:02:45.618 --> 00:02:51.019]  He knows how they killed him, how they killed Dr. David Kelly, and why they killed Dr. David Kelly.
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:00.842]  And that's because they have to protect Tony Blair at all costs, because Tony Blair is Europe's man to bring in the euro.
[00:03:01.662 --> 00:03:11.885]  And according to the information that my guest is going to be sharing with us, the French intelligence was used to do the dirty work, which is what I've seen in the past.
[00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:23.291]  An intelligence agency of a country will use its sister intelligence agency that it works with in another nation to do hits for them, and that happens vice versa.
[00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:36.496]  That happened at Waco, according to the Fort Worth Star newspaper, where they used MI5-controlled special air services people out there doing some of the wet work.
[00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:56.882]  So this is done over and over again, where they use foreign troops, foreign individuals, to kill their own people internally, because it's very dangerous to use your own intelligence people to kill fellow intelligence people, like Dr. David Kelly, who was a top spy, and of course, head of Fort Downe Bioweapons Lab, and the head British inspector.
[00:03:58.223 --> 00:04:00.644]  So, again, that's coming up the next hour.
[00:04:00.684 --> 00:04:06.228]  We appreciate Mr. Shrimpton, Michael Shrimpton, coming on the show, Barrister Shrimpton,
[00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:14.122]  Again, who's even given security briefings to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence here in our own country.
[00:04:14.682 --> 00:04:19.005]  He'll be joining us from England, and I want to thank the folks that helped us put this story together.
[00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:24.990]  We'll be writing an article tonight and thanking them, all the great folks that have been involved in this.
[00:04:27.232 --> 00:04:33.337]  And then when we get back, it is true, I made some phone calls after I got better this weekend.
[00:04:34.778 --> 00:04:35.458]  It is true, in
[00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:43.548]  In Lyon County, Kentucky, it is illegal to give someone one of my videotapes.
[00:04:43.608 --> 00:04:45.910]  It's illegal to give them a History Channel videotape.
[00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.812]  It's illegal to speak out against any government policy.
[00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:51.893]  It's even been in the newspaper.
[00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.715]  And I've made the phone calls, got the faxes, got the news articles.
[00:04:56.516 --> 00:04:57.376]  That's true, too.
[00:04:58.097 --> 00:04:59.618]  So we'll talk about that a lot more.
[00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:00.238]  Just stay with us.
[00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.471]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:06.933]  Pollution, harm, diseases, health issues like allergies, asthma, probably die.
[00:05:06.953 --> 00:05:07.953]  Well listen to this.
[00:05:08.193 --> 00:05:17.157]  Did you know according to the American Lung Association combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually 6 to 10 times worse than the air outside?
[00:05:17.177 --> 00:05:18.077]  6 to 10 times worse?
[00:05:18.097 --> 00:05:19.498]  Because I'd be you asking.
[00:05:19.598 --> 00:05:20.919]  Think about what's inside your home.
[00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:23.320]  Hairspray, chemicals, does anyone smoke?
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.580]  Fumes.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.461]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:26.561]  What do you think all
[00:05:30.802 --> 00:05:31.523]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.102 --> 00:06:04.363]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.423 --> 00:06:08.625]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:11.645]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.846 --> 00:06:14.226]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:23.089]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:24.610]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.951]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:29.611]  I think so.
[00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:07.453]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:07:07.753 --> 00:07:09.153]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:11.534]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:07:11.674 --> 00:07:13.774]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:07:14.054 --> 00:07:18.995]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:23.356]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:07:23.596 --> 00:07:25.376]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:36.099]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:38.160]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.201]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:43.741]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:43.981]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:54.365]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:07:54.645 --> 00:07:55.405]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:07:55.425 --> 00:08:07.610]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:14.213]  All right, my friends, a big show for you today, eight minutes into this three-hour broadcast.
[00:08:16.154 --> 00:08:19.475]  Coming up in the next hour, we have Michael Shrimpton, national
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:32.658]  Intelligence barrister and so does national intelligence work for the government national security work again he has briefed the Senate Select Committee on
[00:08:33.656 --> 00:08:36.939]  On intelligence and terrorism here in the U.S.
[00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:45.725]  and he has traveled extensively all over the world and spoken and consulted concerning terrorism and he says the evidence is clear.
[00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:48.648]  He has his sources throughout the British government.
[00:08:48.688 --> 00:08:51.450]  He knows who killed Dr. David Kelly.
[00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:56.734]  So you're not going to want to miss this interview in the second hour.
[00:08:57.114 --> 00:08:59.376]  Three doctors dispute how David
[00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:01.426]  Kelly died.
[00:09:01.506 --> 00:09:05.409]  This was, of course, out of major British newspapers a week ago.
[00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:20.301]  As medical professionals and trauma orthopedic surgeon, a specialist in anesthesiology and a diagnostic radiologist, we do not think evidence given at the Hutton Inquiry has demonstrated that Dr. David Kelly committed suicide!
[00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:29.054]  And then, David Halpin, who we've got coming on this week, trauma and orthopedic surgeon, talks about how he was clearly murdered.
[00:09:29.674 --> 00:09:42.943]  Dr. C. Stephen Frost, B.C., M.B., C.H.B., specialist in diagnostic radiology, Stockholm, Sweden, is also going to be coming on the show, talks about how he was clearly whacked and others.
[00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.230]  So, you do not want to miss this.
[00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.834]  And of course, he told colleagues that I'm going to be murdered and put in the woods for what I've said.
[00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:52.175]  And a few weeks later, he was dead.
[00:09:52.215 --> 00:10:01.322]  It's like Princess Diana saying, Prince Charles is going to kill me in a fake automobile accident if I don't stop, you know, going out with Dowdy.
[00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:03.003]  And then what happens?
[00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:05.245]  It's just, I mean, come on here!
[00:10:05.585 --> 00:10:07.506]  I'm going to be murdered and put in the woods!
[00:10:08.947 --> 00:10:12.750]  This is what this big spy chief was saying, and then it happens to him.
[00:10:14.247 --> 00:10:21.134]  And I was talking to Mr. Shrimpton, Barrister Shrimpton today, and he said people are very mad at intelligence.
[00:10:21.194 --> 00:10:23.557]  I mean, they don't like it when their own people are being killed.
[00:10:24.317 --> 00:10:26.059]  So that's coming up.
[00:10:28.922 --> 00:10:35.489]  I mentioned in the last segment that it indeed is true that in areas of Kentucky there is no First Amendment.
[00:10:37.592 --> 00:10:46.419]  I called the judge up this weekend concerning that case we talked about last Wednesday before I fell ill on this Thursday and Friday with the dastardly flu.
[00:10:47.861 --> 00:11:00.951]  And I had the caller who called into the show and he talked about how he just gave a cop a video and the cop later pulled him over and said this was a threat and took him to jail.
[00:11:01.332 --> 00:11:06.356]  It wasn't just my video, it was Discovery Channel, C-SPAN stuff, History Channel programs.
[00:11:08.306 --> 00:11:10.407]  And the officer thought that this was a threat.
[00:11:10.767 --> 00:11:12.647]  You know, mainstream television shows.
[00:11:12.707 --> 00:11:13.647]  Here, watch this.
[00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:14.528]  It's informative.
[00:11:15.688 --> 00:11:22.470]  And I found out from the prosecutor's office that, well, they don't really want to prosecute this, but the state police have requested it.
[00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.250]  Of course, they've got the proper federal training and all.
[00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:29.512]  And they decided to go ahead and, well, he's in court right now.
[00:11:29.552 --> 00:11:30.972]  He's supposed to call an aftercourt.
[00:11:31.813 --> 00:11:35.057]  And tell us what happens if Kelly Rushing even gets out of there.
[00:11:35.858 --> 00:11:37.439]  I talked to his brother, Tim Rushing.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.082]  Kelly got my videos from Tim.
[00:11:41.844 --> 00:11:50.474]  And Tim's brother gave him the contraband material, the Evil History and Discovery Channel pieces, and C-SPAN pieces as well.
[00:11:51.852 --> 00:11:58.646]  So this is America, folks, and the judge just sat there and told them, you're guilty of giving a police officer anti-government, anti-police material.
[00:11:59.147 --> 00:12:01.853]  And remember, I have the mainstream documents.
[00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:09.594]  Law Enforcement Technology Magazine says if they've got to get us out of the UN sticker on their car, go ahead and take them to jail.
[00:12:09.955 --> 00:12:11.676]  Chances are they're a terrorist or a criminal.
[00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:16.098]  And it even said in there, Police Chiefs, don't criticize your men and women for doing this.
[00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:17.439]  They're doing the right thing.
[00:12:17.479 --> 00:12:19.060]  Go ahead and find something on these people.
[00:12:19.441 --> 00:12:23.803]  Major magazines say, go ahead and find something on us, because we don't like the UN.
[00:12:25.464 --> 00:12:29.588]  I mean the Republican Party platform in most states says get out of the U.N.
[00:12:30.108 --> 00:12:31.450]  The Texas platform does.
[00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.351]  Most people don't like the U.N.
[00:12:33.412 --> 00:12:34.893]  Even liberals don't like the U.N.
[00:12:34.913 --> 00:12:35.634]  in many cases.
[00:12:36.895 --> 00:12:38.276]  But even everybody hated it.
[00:12:38.456 --> 00:12:40.158]  And we were 1% of the population.
[00:12:40.198 --> 00:12:41.419]  It's called the First Amendment.
[00:12:41.599 --> 00:12:42.700]  You morons!
[00:12:43.001 --> 00:12:44.202]  What is wrong with you?
[00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.633]  And a good old boy with no criminal record.
[00:12:48.673 --> 00:12:49.794]  I mean, I called all over town.
[00:12:49.814 --> 00:12:50.815]  I talked to the newspaper.
[00:12:50.855 --> 00:12:51.876]  I talked to his family.
[00:12:52.516 --> 00:12:56.600]  I call people randomly out of the, you know, from information.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.421]  Hey, do you know this Kelly Rushing?
[00:12:58.501 --> 00:12:59.742]  Oh, he's a really nice man.
[00:13:00.043 --> 00:13:01.144]  Helps in the community.
[00:13:01.504 --> 00:13:02.625]  Stays to himself.
[00:13:03.646 --> 00:13:04.887]  It's a little bitty town.
[00:13:05.747 --> 00:13:07.829]  He just gives a police officer a view.
[00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.912]  Officer, you may want to find out about the New World Order.
[00:13:11.863 --> 00:13:13.624]  Well here, let me arrest you!
[00:13:13.684 --> 00:13:15.765]  And we're gonna try to put you in jail for a year!
[00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:18.387]  This proves we're in the Soviet Union!
[00:13:20.068 --> 00:13:21.389]  I can't handle it anymore, folks.
[00:13:21.909 --> 00:13:29.674]  So that's coming up to, um... Okay, coming up.
[00:13:30.174 --> 00:13:32.356]  It's just, this show is too jam-packed.
[00:13:33.697 --> 00:13:36.878]  Anti-Semitism Charges Causing More Damage Than Film Could.
[00:13:37.239 --> 00:13:40.701]  This is by Jewish leader Daniel LePen, who's a rabbi.
[00:13:42.017 --> 00:13:44.178]  And he's saying exactly what I said last week.
[00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:50.682]  That the ADL should not represent Jews, and that it's a sick joke.
[00:13:51.654 --> 00:14:01.160]  And that they cause division, and that all the Jews he's talking to think it's a big joke, and are friends with Christians, and he says every Christian he knows likes Jews.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.121]  I like Jews!
[00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:03.542]  I got Jewish friends!
[00:14:03.942 --> 00:14:04.782]  And I'm sick of this!
[00:14:05.043 --> 00:14:06.844]  I'm tired of the ADL and the rest of these people!
[00:14:07.224 --> 00:14:09.825]  And you gotta read this Daily News editorial.
[00:14:10.306 --> 00:14:13.628]  It's on Infowars.com, by this rabbi.
[00:14:13.668 --> 00:14:16.249]  I mean, it's like I wrote this article or something.
[00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.611]  I mean, I'm totally in agreement with this guy.
[00:14:19.787 --> 00:14:21.368]  And I'm not going to get into Hutton Gibson.
[00:14:21.448 --> 00:14:23.130]  I've talked to Hutton Gibson many times.
[00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.691]  He is not anti-Semitic.
[00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:27.253]  He says he doesn't like Nazis.
[00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:28.754]  He doesn't like Zionists.
[00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.815]  He doesn't like the corrupt Catholic Church.
[00:14:31.216 --> 00:14:40.183]  I mean, there's not a lot of things that Hutton Gibson likes, and he's the winner of, you know, Jeopardy, and he knows history, and he's a pretty smart guy, and he does think the Holocaust happened.
[00:14:40.203 --> 00:14:48.329]  He just debates the numbers and says that people should be allowed to debate those numbers, and he says these interviews have been taken out of context, and so we'll see what happens.
[00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:50.690]  I had MSNBC call me.
[00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.271]  I had CNN call.
[00:14:53.291 --> 00:14:54.612]  I had a bunch of other people call.
[00:14:55.092 --> 00:14:56.253]  And I'm not doing interviews.
[00:14:56.453 --> 00:14:59.715]  I'm not going to go on national TV and talk about Hutton Gibson.
[00:15:00.055 --> 00:15:03.657]  Alexander Emmerich Jones doesn't do that to his friends.
[00:15:03.677 --> 00:15:07.799]  I can care less about being on MSNBC or CNN or something like that.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.960]  I'm just not going to do it.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.022]  I thought about going on and defending Hutton.
[00:15:14.342 --> 00:15:15.723]  I'm just not going to get involved in it.
[00:15:16.463 --> 00:15:17.744]  I'm just not going to get involved in it.
[00:15:20.498 --> 00:15:22.180]  Who knows, I might have a change of heart and do it.
[00:15:23.101 --> 00:15:25.344]  I've been a little weird, folks.
[00:15:26.305 --> 00:15:27.426]  I'm somebody who never gets sick.
[00:15:27.846 --> 00:15:29.949]  I mean, I get a cold or something, I just ignore it.
[00:15:29.969 --> 00:15:31.891]  I get a fever, it's like I don't have it.
[00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:32.592]  Well, let me tell you.
[00:15:33.593 --> 00:15:34.174]  Let me tell you.
[00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:36.556]  I had a 104 fever for two days.
[00:15:37.317 --> 00:15:38.739]  I had to go to the emergency clinic.
[00:15:39.546 --> 00:15:41.187]  I was puking for two days.
[00:15:41.387 --> 00:15:43.208]  I mean, every hour on the hour.
[00:15:43.248 --> 00:15:43.948]  Dry heaves.
[00:15:44.028 --> 00:15:46.909]  I don't know why I'm even telling you about this, but I feel like a new man.
[00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:51.311]  I mean, I just feel cleansed somehow, and I feel really good.
[00:15:52.031 --> 00:15:57.353]  And, uh, so... I'm saying I don't know what I'll do tomorrow.
[00:15:57.413 --> 00:15:59.334]  I'm kind of unpredictable right now.
[00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:04.336]  House votes for ignition interlocks on every vehicle.
[00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:06.237]  Now, folks, I have a stack.
[00:16:07.142 --> 00:16:08.063]  This is why I'm frustrated.
[00:16:08.103 --> 00:16:11.225]  It's been four or five days since I've been on the air, and it's just a giant stack.
[00:16:13.186 --> 00:16:17.029]  House votes for ignition interlocks on every vehicle.
[00:16:19.831 --> 00:16:21.852]  And, uh, hmm, sounds interesting.
[00:16:22.392 --> 00:16:24.274]  Do you know what that's fancy doublespeak for?
[00:16:25.935 --> 00:16:27.376]  Well, what I told you they were going to do.
[00:16:27.396 --> 00:16:31.919]  And again, I hate to say it, because I told you, because I told you, because I told you, but I have their official plans.
[00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:39.564]  New Mexico has passed the law out of the House, it's in the Senate, to make everyone blow a breathalyzer to start your car.
[00:16:40.145 --> 00:16:41.826]  Everyone guilty until proven innocent.
[00:16:42.086 --> 00:16:42.266]  Why?
[00:16:42.286 --> 00:16:43.547]  If it just saves one life.
[00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:54.236]  And then they're going to say that this doesn't work because people have others blow, so oh, we're going to have to retina scan you, and it'll decide if you're drunk, and this will be the new law.
[00:16:54.457 --> 00:16:55.478]  Now, how do I know that?
[00:16:55.578 --> 00:17:00.462]  Because I saw the federal plans four or five years ago, I read Houston Chronicle articles three years ago,
[00:17:01.744 --> 00:17:20.735]  They have a system that they're already putting into businesses all over the country, and the Feds are using a retina scanner that also reads microscopic movement of the eye, and it'll decide if you're on drugs, or drunk, or tired, and they want to put all these in the cars, and so they're going to make you use the breathalyzer, then people are going to cheat, and they're going to say, okay, you've got a retina scan to start your car.
[00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:22.496]  Now that's the official plan.
[00:17:22.516 --> 00:17:24.217]  If you want to put up with it, go ahead.
[00:17:25.126 --> 00:17:36.393]  And then if you're not a good globalist, they turn your car off, and they're going to have infrared cameras on all the cars by 2005, quote, as a detector if there's a child in the car when it's too hot.
[00:17:37.514 --> 00:17:39.595]  But again, the federal plan is it's really a camera.
[00:17:39.855 --> 00:17:42.137]  Just like I told you, OnStar is listening to you.
[00:17:42.377 --> 00:17:46.940]  Now that's mainstream news, hooked in with the NSA listening to you with computers.
[00:17:49.301 --> 00:17:50.402]  So I'll get back into this.
[00:17:50.462 --> 00:17:51.662]  I could spend an hour on that.
[00:17:53.775 --> 00:17:59.836]  Remember last week, we talked about the bill where if you fly any flag with the American flag, you're arrested as a terrorist.
[00:18:00.156 --> 00:18:02.277]  If you criticize the government, you're arrested as a terrorist.
[00:18:02.317 --> 00:18:03.477]  I mean, I read from the bill.
[00:18:04.858 --> 00:18:06.958]  In Rhode Island, and they passed the law in other states.
[00:18:08.138 --> 00:18:09.019]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:18:09.419 --> 00:18:13.179]  We posted the Providence Journal articles and others at InfoWars.com.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.300]  Here it is, right here in front of me.
[00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:19.783]  And it says, Governor pulls bill on Homeland Security.
[00:18:19.804 --> 00:18:26.569]  The Governor, who says he is surprised by the reaction to his proposal, will introduce another anti-terrorism law this legislative session.
[00:18:26.629 --> 00:18:27.450]  See, that's what they do.
[00:18:28.871 --> 00:18:37.898]  Governor withdrew his Homeland Security bill yesterday after Congressional scholars from the American Civil Liberties Union assailed the proposal as a dangerous assault on civil rights.
[00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:45.244]  The Governor said he had not read the bill, but that his staff wrote it before he made it public.
[00:18:45.979 --> 00:18:48.000]  But he received a briefing.
[00:18:49.141 --> 00:18:51.982]  This is not the kind of reaction I anticipated or expected.
[00:18:52.443 --> 00:18:55.104]  The governor said in a brief news conference outside his office.
[00:18:56.265 --> 00:18:59.687]  And so he now claims he hadn't read the bill.
[00:19:00.347 --> 00:19:09.072]  And it was the 1918 Sedition Law, the one Savage calls for, that if you criticize the government in time of war, you're put in a forced labor camp.
[00:19:10.114 --> 00:19:17.799]  And I have another bill here where we have them in Canada calling for forest forced labor camps.
[00:19:18.179 --> 00:19:19.760]  Yes, it's really happening.
[00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:24.984]  And if we don't speak up, they're going to pass this stuff.
[00:19:25.024 --> 00:19:26.825]  If we do speak up, they're not going to get away with it.
[00:19:28.246 --> 00:19:30.467]  And some people don't believe what this bill had in it.
[00:19:30.507 --> 00:19:32.769]  So later if I have time, I want to read some of what was in this bill.
[00:19:35.089 --> 00:19:39.953]  Supreme Court upholds judges' right to compel medication to prepare you for trial.
[00:19:41.275 --> 00:19:44.437]  Years of FBI agents' crimes to tell from CBS News.
[00:19:44.478 --> 00:19:48.621]  I could spend an hour on the murders, the heroin, the cocaine dealing.
[00:19:49.862 --> 00:19:51.304]  They are organized crime.
[00:19:51.904 --> 00:19:53.125]  They are the Mafia.
[00:19:53.806 --> 00:19:55.167]  And they say Bin Laden is surrounded.
[00:19:55.187 --> 00:19:56.248]  They're about to capture him.
[00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:58.290]  As we said they would years ago.
[00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.931]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.951 --> 00:19:59.391]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.656 --> 00:20:05.197]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:20:05.517 --> 00:20:05.858]  Yes!
[00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:08.519]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood.
[00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:10.940]  The richest nutritional liquid known to man.

[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.721]  I'm going to try to focus here.
[00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:09.723]  Your calls are coming up in this first hour.
[00:24:09.743 --> 00:24:13.705]  I do want to read this editorial, at least the first page of it.
[00:24:14.324 --> 00:24:16.105]  By Rabbi Daniel Lappin.
[00:24:17.126 --> 00:24:20.309]  Anti-Semitism charges causing more damage than film could.
[00:24:20.329 --> 00:24:21.730]  And that's true.
[00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.692]  Nobody would have even gone to this film and thought anything about Jews.
[00:24:24.712 --> 00:24:26.954]  I mean, Jesus was a Jew, folks.
[00:24:27.334 --> 00:24:29.215]  And that, you know, that's what happened.
[00:24:29.235 --> 00:24:32.798]  He was criticizing the corruption of the establishment and of the religion.
[00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:37.522]  Also, I want to get back into house votes for ignition interlocks on every vehicle.
[00:24:38.621 --> 00:24:53.026]  They've passed a law, it's out of the house in New Mexico, and other states are doing the same thing, it's federally funded to do all this, to make you blow a breathalyzer to start your car, training you that you're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:24:53.066 --> 00:24:54.326]  It's the new Soviet model.
[00:24:55.526 --> 00:24:57.567]  Do I have to explain how this is un-American?
[00:24:58.439 --> 00:25:02.381]  And I want to get back into the governor of Rhode Island having to pull this bill.
[00:25:02.441 --> 00:25:08.884]  I mean, I've never seen one this bad, where if you fly any flag with the American flag, you'll be put in a camp.
[00:25:09.224 --> 00:25:11.866]  If you criticize the government, you'll be put in a camp.
[00:25:12.366 --> 00:25:14.827]  Folks, it actually said that.
[00:25:15.888 --> 00:25:17.849]  And the governor said, I didn't read it.
[00:25:17.989 --> 00:25:18.609]  I'm sorry.
[00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:20.850]  I'm getting this firestorm.
[00:25:22.391 --> 00:25:23.792]  So that's coming up, too.
[00:25:24.788 --> 00:25:29.632]  And the Supreme Court saying, hey, we can grab you, not even charge you, drug you as long as we want to.
[00:25:29.652 --> 00:25:31.733]  That's the New York Times.
[00:25:32.754 --> 00:25:39.979]  This CBS article about the FBI murder, drug dealing, prostitution, running organized crime.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.282]  The John Gottis of the world work for the FBI.
[00:25:43.822 --> 00:25:47.425]  And when one stops paying their cut, the FBI busts them and calls them a kingpin.
[00:25:48.494 --> 00:25:52.417]  When Noriega stops paying in the cocaine money, he gets a military raid.
[00:25:52.597 --> 00:25:56.640]  When Saddam stops paying in the oil money and the BCCI, he gets a raid.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.161]  That's how it works.
[00:25:58.181 --> 00:25:59.421]  These are mid-level nobodies.
[00:25:59.742 --> 00:26:01.083]  Bin Laden is surrounded.
[00:26:01.123 --> 00:26:03.644]  Sunday Telegraph, Washington Times, U.S.
[00:26:03.664 --> 00:26:05.125]  search for Bin Laden intensifies.
[00:26:05.205 --> 00:26:06.046]  Oh, they've got him.
[00:26:06.746 --> 00:26:09.648]  So, we'll get back into that, too.
[00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:13.611]  That's the first half inch of a four-inch stack.
[00:26:14.812 --> 00:26:15.232]  Okay?
[00:26:16.072 --> 00:26:16.753]  But right now,
[00:26:17.813 --> 00:26:39.538]  The next ten minutes or so, part of the segment of the next segment, I want to talk to Tim Rushing, and I know his brother's trying to get in on the line, the man this happened to, Kelly Rushing, out in Lyon County, Kentucky, where giving someone a C-SPAN video is punishable by one year in prison.
[00:26:40.749 --> 00:27:06.091]  uh... the police uh... the state police and prosecutor they say yes uh... you're not allowed to give police mainstream videos and say sir this might be informative uh... and i'm not joking i mean you know we don't joke on the show folks if we are joking we'll tell you i mean this is just let's be honest about how sovietized we've gotten and uh... Tim is the brother of uh... Kelly and uh... Mr. Rushing good to have you on the show how did your brothers uh...
[00:27:06.943 --> 00:27:08.945]  Beginning of his trial go this morning.
[00:27:09.285 --> 00:27:11.947]  Well Alex, looks like they're going to hold it over until March the 8th.
[00:27:13.568 --> 00:27:16.250]  So they're going to continue to try to stall things?
[00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:16.890]  Looks that way.
[00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:22.374]  So what happened when you went before the magistrate who I talked to at his home this weekend by the way?
[00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:29.676]  Well, I talked to William G. McCaslin, the judge, this weekend.
[00:27:29.696 --> 00:27:32.117]  What did he say at the little court hearing this morning?
[00:27:33.177 --> 00:27:34.838]  I haven't talked to Kelly in about five minutes.
[00:27:34.978 --> 00:27:39.580]  All he told me is that they were holding over and he was trying to call in to give you the particulars.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:40.721]  Well, okay.
[00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:42.362]  Was he able to get through, Stephanie?
[00:27:44.482 --> 00:27:44.943]  Okay.
[00:27:45.103 --> 00:27:47.624]  Perhaps you need to call him and make sure he's got the right number.
[00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:52.220]  Kelly, if you're out there listening, I don't know if we have phone lines open, but 1-800-259-9231, Kelly.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:52.300]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.961]  We need to get him on.
[00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:57.181]  I made about 20 phone calls this weekend.
[00:27:57.201 --> 00:27:58.342]  I confirmed this story.
[00:28:06.511 --> 00:28:19.786]  I mean, this is hard to believe, Tim, that in America, given somebody a C-SPAN video, an Alex Jones video, and the state police have told the prosecutor, we want that man behind bars for years for giving us this video.
[00:28:20.186 --> 00:28:22.169]  Well, I don't think we're going to stop handing them out.
[00:28:22.209 --> 00:28:27.835]  I guess we just better get our bags ready for Cleb Guantanamo and our toothbrushes and everything, because we're not going to stop.
[00:28:28.999 --> 00:28:31.500]  Well, if they want to make a big deal out of this, they're going to get in deep trouble.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.840]  There's a lot of organizations that will want to take this case.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.921]  As long as your brother doesn't plea bargain, he's going to be just fine.
[00:28:37.921 --> 00:28:40.282]  You know, unless they pull some good old boy behavior on him.
[00:28:40.322 --> 00:28:43.623]  But I've been told the judge, the prosecutor, they don't like it.
[00:28:43.663 --> 00:28:49.364]  But they think, supposedly, I guess that the state police are their bosses or something.
[00:28:49.624 --> 00:28:50.505]  That's what I understand.
[00:28:50.525 --> 00:28:51.745]  The state police are pushing this.
[00:28:52.706 --> 00:29:03.073]  Probably, it would be my guess, that the officer that watched the tape, he was probably guilty of some of the tactics that he portrayed on the film and got a little upset and thought he'd take it out on Kelly.
[00:29:04.995 --> 00:29:09.478]  What type of individual would want to put somebody behind bars for years for no reason?
[00:29:09.518 --> 00:29:12.180]  I mean, just because you don't like the video you got?
[00:29:14.141 --> 00:29:16.683]  Well, you know their mentality.
[00:29:16.703 --> 00:29:17.624]  It's us against them.
[00:29:17.684 --> 00:29:20.326]  I mean, you know, they're our overlords, our protectors.
[00:29:21.687 --> 00:29:23.108]  And they know what's best for us.
[00:29:23.488 --> 00:29:26.769]  The incredible thing is, they admit in the newspaper and the police admit.
[00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:28.630]  I mean, there's been news articles about this, folks.
[00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:29.930]  I've got them.
[00:29:30.411 --> 00:29:31.351]  He gave them a video.
[00:29:31.391 --> 00:29:32.251]  That's his crime.
[00:29:32.291 --> 00:29:33.292]  Just mainstream video.
[00:29:33.312 --> 00:29:37.673]  Yeah, there was an article come out down there in the paper supposedly about this.
[00:29:38.034 --> 00:29:40.314]  Well, there was already one article about your brother's arrest.
[00:29:41.175 --> 00:29:43.836]  I think there was one about the tape incident, too, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:29:43.956 --> 00:29:44.516]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:29:44.556 --> 00:29:45.416]  Both of you stay there.
[00:29:45.937 --> 00:29:46.937]  We've got Kelly now.
[00:29:46.997 --> 00:29:47.697]  Tim, stay there.
[00:29:47.977 --> 00:29:48.638]  We'll be back.
[00:29:48.678 --> 00:29:49.078]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.562 --> 00:29:54.623]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.643 --> 00:29:58.284]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.886 --> 00:30:04.646]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[00:30:05.167 --> 00:30:08.588]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:30:09.088 --> 00:30:09.768]  Let's update.
[00:30:10.268 --> 00:30:15.030]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.011]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:19.715]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:30:19.755 --> 00:30:22.056]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:30:22.576 --> 00:30:23.496]  Today, the U.S.
[00:30:23.516 --> 00:30:25.737]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:30:26.137 --> 00:30:27.658]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:30:28.238 --> 00:30:30.238]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:36.440]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.181]  Gold is moving.
[00:30:38.441 --> 00:30:39.601]  Equities are treading water.
[00:30:40.001 --> 00:30:42.662]  They say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:30:43.202 --> 00:30:44.582]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:30:45.002 --> 00:30:46.663]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:49.116]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[00:32:02.988 --> 00:32:04.128]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:32:04.308 --> 00:32:07.709]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:07.829 --> 00:32:08.269]  Phenol?
[00:32:08.569 --> 00:32:15.651]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:32:15.991 --> 00:32:20.096]  EDTA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:32:20.196 --> 00:32:20.656]  Fragrance?
[00:32:21.017 --> 00:32:25.802]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:25.922 --> 00:32:30.627]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:32:30.847 --> 00:32:33.330]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.

[00:33:01.723 --> 00:33:07.386]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.728 --> 00:33:25.554]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lives of disinformation, coming up... Michael Shrimpton, national security lawyer, barrister in England,
[00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:38.534]  Written for the Journal of International Security Affairs, briefed the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence here in our own country, bringing forward the evidence from his inside sources of who really killed Dr. David Kelly.
[00:33:38.574 --> 00:33:40.355]  Believe me, you're not going to want to miss this interview.
[00:33:40.375 --> 00:33:50.904]  We're going to finish up with our guest here in just a few minutes with the First Amendment here in America, the state of it, and with the incredibly brainwashed, zombified state police and other
[00:33:51.875 --> 00:33:52.315]  We're good.
[00:34:11.522 --> 00:34:12.203]  We're good to go.
[00:34:25.006 --> 00:34:27.807]  Rushing's brother, Tim Rushing, made the videos.
[00:34:27.847 --> 00:34:30.468]  It was C-SPAN, History Channel, Discovery Channel stuff.
[00:34:30.849 --> 00:34:31.849]  One of my videos.
[00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:35.591]  And by the way, one of my videos, stuff from my videos, is aired on national TV.
[00:34:35.611 --> 00:34:39.212]  This is just documented stuff, just like this show, mainstream news stuff.
[00:34:39.492 --> 00:34:40.433]  We just analyze it.
[00:34:40.853 --> 00:34:42.294]  Nothing threatening to this guy.
[00:34:42.794 --> 00:34:44.835]  So he goes and has him arrested.
[00:34:45.295 --> 00:34:49.657]  And by the way, this just happened to a Keep and Bear Arms writer, who also writes for Guns and Ammo.
[00:34:50.437 --> 00:34:51.978]  He had police come to his house,
[00:34:52.890 --> 00:35:02.693]  Because he wrote a letter to the San Francisco Police Department saying, you guys are violating the law, uh, handing out these, uh, marriage certificates.
[00:35:02.713 --> 00:35:03.654]  That's all he said.
[00:35:04.794 --> 00:35:07.375]  And they came out and said, you know, you're a gun writer.
[00:35:07.415 --> 00:35:09.576]  You're not planning to use some guns, are you?
[00:35:09.596 --> 00:35:18.859]  I mean, that's how, see, it's all these secret police need to talk to you, because you might, you know, do something, but the border stays wide open.
[00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:23.390]  Going back here for a few minutes to Kelly Rushing.
[00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:38.913]  Kelly, what happened to you, thought criminal that you are, when you went in now to the court this morning before Judge William G. McCaslin for your crime, as he said, of giving someone an anti-government videotape?
[00:35:39.093 --> 00:35:44.034]  Well, that was Bill McCaslin, but Bill G. McCaslin.
[00:35:44.854 --> 00:35:47.355]  What happened was not a whole lot.
[00:35:48.223 --> 00:35:57.692]  They're discontinuing it until March the 8th because the prosecuting attorney hasn't seen the arrest tape yet, from my understanding.
[00:35:58.793 --> 00:36:02.857]  Now through discovery before that tape disappears and the cop claims that you were, you know,
[00:36:04.048 --> 00:36:09.071]  Flying around with flying saucers and black satanic altars and dragons shooting up out of the ground.
[00:36:09.371 --> 00:36:15.175]  Before he claimed that you had lasers shooting out of your eyes and grew 19 inch fangs and spit acid on him.
[00:36:15.595 --> 00:36:19.258]  Before he says that, you need to do discovery and get that video.
[00:36:20.138 --> 00:36:20.959]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:21.019 --> 00:36:25.542]  Because he'll claim you sprouted wings, you know, later.
[00:36:26.042 --> 00:36:29.024]  But luckily we've got his police report.
[00:36:29.064 --> 00:36:31.505]  He says the video is threatening and that's the crime.
[00:36:32.026 --> 00:36:32.226]  Right.
[00:36:32.671 --> 00:36:47.441]  I did give a couple of the tapes to the prosecuting attorney and he called me over and said that he enjoyed the tapes and told me that they wouldn't get his gun unless they prodded out of his cold dead hand.
[00:36:47.541 --> 00:36:50.883]  Well see this is the point, and I've gotten the same thing from the city and the county.
[00:36:51.284 --> 00:36:54.146]  They don't want to go after you but the state police are filing a complaint.
[00:36:54.846 --> 00:36:55.807]  Right.
[00:36:55.827 --> 00:36:59.209]  So he enjoyed the videos but he's still going to prosecute you.
[00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:00.650]  Yeah, well.
[00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:01.831]  But what did you say to him?
[00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:08.074]  Well, I just basically said, well, we see eye to eye about the gun issue.
[00:37:09.595 --> 00:37:12.598]  Now, he might have been trying to get you to say something like, yeah, they'll never get mine.
[00:37:13.198 --> 00:37:14.139]  Oh, that's a threat!
[00:37:14.179 --> 00:37:15.200]  That's a threat!
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.361]  Swat team!
[00:37:16.381 --> 00:37:17.902]  I wouldn't even talk to these people.
[00:37:19.123 --> 00:37:21.745]  Now, did they say they're going to drop this, or they're just going to hear it later?
[00:37:22.646 --> 00:37:28.230]  No, they're going to review the arrest tape to see what kind of approach they're going to take.
[00:37:30.484 --> 00:37:35.926]  The policeman said that there's some things that I said on the arrest tape that proves his point.
[00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:37.267]  Yeah, I love this.
[00:37:37.307 --> 00:37:41.589]  He arrests you for giving him a video and then tries to claim that you threatened him in the police car.
[00:37:41.629 --> 00:37:45.471]  That's like Carl Klang, by the way.
[00:37:45.791 --> 00:37:47.652]  They finally released him after two and a half months.
[00:37:47.692 --> 00:37:49.793]  The judge said, I don't know why you were held this long.
[00:37:50.233 --> 00:37:51.033]  I apologize.
[00:37:51.073 --> 00:37:52.374]  I have the Associated Press article.
[00:37:53.495 --> 00:38:00.861]  Yeah, oh no, the bed charges came, which they by the way dropped, once he was in the jail cell.
[00:38:01.281 --> 00:38:05.585]  See, they arrest you so you can commit the crimes in the jail cell or in the squad car.
[00:38:05.785 --> 00:38:07.367]  I love this new Soviet system.
[00:38:07.767 --> 00:38:19.217]  Yeah, I know that after he told me to get out of the truck, and that's all he said when he came to my window, and the second thing he said was turn around,
[00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:22.771]  And at that time I asked him, what am I being arrested for?
[00:38:23.452 --> 00:38:26.255]  And at that time he said, terroristic threatening.
[00:38:26.935 --> 00:38:35.923]  And then later on when I told him, when I was in the car... I understand you had a discussion with him and you said that you said, well I haven't threatened you.
[00:38:35.963 --> 00:38:39.046]  I mean, I think a man would want to know what's going on in the world for his family.
[00:38:39.602 --> 00:38:41.643]  So now the word family's a threat, see?
[00:38:41.923 --> 00:38:43.424]  I mean, that's what we all say.
[00:38:43.444 --> 00:38:46.925]  We're trying to protect our children, protect this country, our children's future.
[00:38:47.145 --> 00:38:50.407]  Well, I've just threatened everybody's children, because I said the word children.
[00:38:50.427 --> 00:38:53.448]  Now, Jerry, you will convict that man!
[00:38:53.628 --> 00:38:57.250]  You will convict Kelly Rushing, because he said the word family!
[00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.350]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:38:59.951 --> 00:39:05.053]  Alex, if Kelly's such a threat to that officer, then why did that officer allow Kelly to leave with his firearm?
[00:39:06.596 --> 00:39:07.176]  Oh, that's right.
[00:39:07.196 --> 00:39:10.179]  Kelly had a firearm in the vehicle, and then when he left jail, they gave it back to him.
[00:39:10.259 --> 00:39:10.719]  That's right.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.502]  No, they never took it from out of the vehicle.
[00:39:14.522 --> 00:39:17.524]  They left it when they impounded the vehicle.
[00:39:18.044 --> 00:39:21.486]  The lazy possums may not have looked.
[00:39:22.507 --> 00:39:29.532]  No, they pulled the... He had Kelly remove it from the glove compartment, and he looked at it and put it back in the glove compartment.
[00:39:29.632 --> 00:39:33.315]  Well, that just means that people still believe in the Second Amendment and aren't completely brainwashed.
[00:39:33.495 --> 00:39:35.236]  No, he didn't have me remove it.
[00:39:35.876 --> 00:39:42.940]  He opened the glove box and I was sitting in the car and could see him opening the glove box and at that time I told him it was legal.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.021]  And he closed it back up.
[00:39:45.041 --> 00:39:52.445]  So basically it's gotten to the point where the prosecutor and the judge know that they can't get you on an Alex Jones and a C-Span video.
[00:39:53.125 --> 00:39:58.548]  So they're going to try to find something on the tape which you didn't do and so you just show that tape to the jury.
[00:39:58.768 --> 00:40:00.789]  Yeah, I think they're starting to back step now.
[00:40:01.539 --> 00:40:03.360]  Well, listen, you keep me abreast of this.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.620]  You do not plea bargain.
[00:40:05.821 --> 00:40:08.902]  And if they try something, we'll put the phone numbers out.
[00:40:08.942 --> 00:40:11.023]  We'll try to get folks there for court watchers.
[00:40:11.443 --> 00:40:12.844]  You need support there, buddy.
[00:40:13.284 --> 00:40:14.144]  Yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:40:15.505 --> 00:40:22.287]  Because anybody that would try to charge someone... So you've been officially charged now with terrorist threats.
[00:40:22.788 --> 00:40:23.768]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:25.345 --> 00:40:42.174]  I know that when I first went to court there, and I've been driving around with a sign in my back window, which is Isaiah 520, which says, Woe unto those that perceive evil for good and good for evil, light for darkness, darkness for light, bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.
[00:40:42.954 --> 00:40:48.197]  And then it says after that, Woe unto those that are wise in the sight of their own eyes.
[00:40:48.217 --> 00:40:52.619]  So, that may shook them up a little bit.
[00:40:54.835 --> 00:40:57.616]  Well, they probably, according to FEMA, that's more terrorism.
[00:40:58.896 --> 00:41:03.478]  Don't give the cops any Bible verses, buddy!
[00:41:04.358 --> 00:41:05.978]  Look at how much trouble LaPassion's in.
[00:41:06.038 --> 00:41:08.039]  My goodness, we've got to watch people like you.
[00:41:08.359 --> 00:41:10.259]  Well, listen, keep me abreast of the situation.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.720]  So they didn't drop it.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.841]  Did your lawyer move for a motion to dismiss?
[00:41:15.821 --> 00:41:22.223]  He took me in a personal room there and told me that he thinks that we're going to
[00:41:23.052 --> 00:41:25.553]  Get it dismissed to where there's no charges.
[00:41:27.354 --> 00:41:30.135]  But he didn't say you just got a plea bargain, bud.
[00:41:30.575 --> 00:41:33.276]  No, they haven't tried the plea bargain yet.
[00:41:34.376 --> 00:41:38.318]  Well, don't unpack your bag, Kelly, because Club Guantanamo's waiting for us.
[00:41:38.878 --> 00:41:39.038]  Yeah.
[00:41:40.385 --> 00:41:47.573]  Now, we're actually talking to the radical criminal right now, and of course I'm evil myself, but he's almost as evil.
[00:41:47.613 --> 00:41:55.102]  Tim Rushing, now you made these videos, exactly what was on the videos your brother gave this officer?
[00:41:55.422 --> 00:41:58.225]  Of course he gave him a 9-1-1 tape, and then there was...
[00:41:59.471 --> 00:42:02.494]  There was a speech that Ron Paul gave on one.
[00:42:03.234 --> 00:42:05.977]  Oh, how evil!
[00:42:06.437 --> 00:42:07.678]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:09.560]  Maybe the congressman should be arrested.
[00:42:10.441 --> 00:42:12.563]  I mean, in Rhode Island he would be if this law had passed.
[00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:15.165]  Now, tell me specifically what Ron Paul speech.
[00:42:16.206 --> 00:42:22.252]  It was the one where he was talking about the Federal Reserve and the neocons that have hijacked the GOP.
[00:42:22.432 --> 00:42:24.253]  Sir, you're saying you've got that tape.
[00:42:24.313 --> 00:42:25.054]  I never got that tape.
[00:42:25.094 --> 00:42:25.695]  Yeah, I've got that.
[00:42:26.696 --> 00:42:29.378]  Tim, promise me you'll mail me your best copy of that.
[00:42:29.458 --> 00:42:30.759]  I'll get you the best copy, Alex.
[00:42:30.879 --> 00:42:33.500]  I'll send you five free videos.
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.441]  I've got all your videos.
[00:42:34.921 --> 00:42:35.722]  I'll send you some more.
[00:42:35.822 --> 00:42:36.682]  Promise me you will.
[00:42:37.603 --> 00:42:39.504]  I'll get it in the mail today to you, Alex.
[00:42:39.604 --> 00:42:41.265]  And write Neocon on there for me.
[00:42:41.425 --> 00:42:41.825]  I'll do it.
[00:42:42.306 --> 00:42:43.987]  Now, I'm starting to understand.
[00:42:44.027 --> 00:42:50.010]  You put the congressman, the Vietnam veteran, the most conservative member of congress on there, talking about the Neocons.
[00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.071]  Boy, this is really evil.
[00:42:51.676 --> 00:42:52.597]  That was on there.
[00:42:52.617 --> 00:42:54.779]  Then there was Fortress America.
[00:42:55.079 --> 00:43:04.666]  Fortress America, which is the thing they did on the Tech Channel about the cameras going up everywhere and about how we're losing our civil liberties because of this war on terrorism.
[00:43:05.327 --> 00:43:08.930]  Very radical to put a mainstream news piece on there.
[00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:10.051]  Conspiracies.
[00:43:10.811 --> 00:43:19.058]  There were some conspiracy theory episodes on there about the New World Order and Big Brother, I think, that runs on the Tech Channel also.
[00:43:21.175 --> 00:43:23.158]  And that's basically it.
[00:43:23.959 --> 00:43:25.040]  Boy, I tell ya.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.084]  I tell ya, this officer's doing his job.
[00:43:29.105 --> 00:43:32.930]  I'm glad he's out there, Kelly, picking people like you up instead of real criminals.
[00:43:33.651 --> 00:43:36.194]  Yeah, we feel well protected here in Kentucky, Alex.
[00:43:37.219 --> 00:43:47.183]  You know, I talk to locals, and I call other members of your family, and I talk to the newspaper and other people, and supposedly your state police are pretty rampant around there.
[00:43:47.783 --> 00:43:50.264]  If you look at them wrong, they're going to go ahead and take you on down.
[00:43:50.524 --> 00:43:52.085]  That's a big imperative.
[00:43:53.245 --> 00:43:55.046]  So I guess they're kind of God around there.
[00:43:55.066 --> 00:44:00.708]  Do they set up shoe sign stations where you've got to park your cars and lick their boots so they're real shiny?
[00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:03.449]  That's the next step, Alex.
[00:44:04.478 --> 00:44:05.919]  Let's don't give them no ideas either.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:07.620]  Yeah.
[00:44:08.541 --> 00:44:08.961]  Alright.
[00:44:09.221 --> 00:44:11.022]  Well, gentlemen, you've got my home phone number.
[00:44:11.062 --> 00:44:11.703]  Stay in touch.
[00:44:11.863 --> 00:44:13.043]  We appreciate all you do, Alex.
[00:44:13.424 --> 00:44:16.466]  And Tim, you told me you're going to keep giving the videos out, right?
[00:44:16.746 --> 00:44:17.306]  Most definitely.
[00:44:17.346 --> 00:44:19.067]  I've got the VCR working overtime now.
[00:44:20.588 --> 00:44:23.790]  Kelly, what you saw in 9-11 actually happened to you, didn't it?
[00:44:25.331 --> 00:44:25.591]  Yeah.
[00:44:25.871 --> 00:44:26.652]  Yeah, it sure did.
[00:44:27.279 --> 00:44:28.520]  Alright, thanks for the call, guys.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.381]  We appreciate it, Alex.
[00:44:30.061 --> 00:44:30.381]  You bet.
[00:44:30.421 --> 00:44:35.665]  I'm about to go to Andy and Eric and Mildred and Ray and Bill before our big guest comes on.
[00:44:38.086 --> 00:44:46.012]  And just briefly, in my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, about five minutes of the two hour, two and a half hour film, there's a woman at a checkpoint.
[00:44:47.509 --> 00:45:02.544]  And they say, we want to search your car, and she says no, so they jerk her out of the car, and then say she assaulted him, which she didn't, which she was later found not guilty of, and then they go, oh my gosh, we, you know, they found the pocket constitution, they found some material about the income tax, that, you know, this may be illegal!
[00:45:03.886 --> 00:45:05.708]  Why, she's got videos in here!
[00:45:06.208 --> 00:45:07.269]  Is this stuff legal?
[00:45:07.389 --> 00:45:08.851]  I don't know if this is legal!
[00:45:10.043 --> 00:45:16.545]  So it's not just FEMA videos and FEMA training manuals and ADL training manuals where they say if you're a Christian, you're a terrorist.
[00:45:16.565 --> 00:45:17.845]  I mean, it's not just their manuals.
[00:45:18.165 --> 00:45:20.326]  We got them out on the road, folks, thinking this.
[00:45:21.026 --> 00:45:33.389]  Imagine a cop going out to their mailbox and pulling out Law Enforcement Technology magazine and opening it up and it says, if they've got an anti-UN sticker on their car, go ahead and arrest them.
[00:45:33.409 --> 00:45:37.610]  I mean, how would a cop not start laughing
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.403]  Oh, they just read it and go, alright, well it's in a magazine.
[00:45:41.423 --> 00:45:46.787]  I better arrest anybody that has an anti-U.N.
[00:45:46.827 --> 00:45:47.247]  bumper.
[00:45:47.348 --> 00:45:49.229]  What is wrong with you people?
[00:45:49.509 --> 00:45:50.990]  How stupid are you?
[00:45:52.412 --> 00:45:53.953]  You really shouldn't move to Russia.
[00:45:56.015 --> 00:46:01.299]  This State Trooper, Dodd, is just... He really should move to Russia.
[00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:09.175]  And luckily, Mr. Dodd, everything's recorded here, so you can't tell any lies about us.
[00:46:09.256 --> 00:46:12.779]  When I call up people in Kentucky, I had a recorder running, too.
[00:46:12.799 --> 00:46:16.743]  You're not going to pull your scams on me.
[00:46:16.763 --> 00:46:18.704]  I know how to record you people.
[00:46:19.665 --> 00:46:25.611]  Very important to record people like you, so you can't change the facts later.
[00:46:28.476 --> 00:46:45.075]  But before we go to these calls, if you want to get 9-11, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, you need to go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or you can simply call toll-free.
[00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:46.272]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:46:46.292 --> 00:46:46.912]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:46:46.952 --> 00:46:48.914]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.
[00:47:03.206 --> 00:47:06.429]  South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:47:06.569 --> 00:47:11.814]  I've made 10 films, I've written a book, I've published a great book by Paul Watson.
[00:47:12.294 --> 00:47:14.776]  I carry a lot of other great videos and books on the websites.
[00:47:15.177 --> 00:47:18.059]  And your support is necessary to make this show possible.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.141]  Your support makes this show possible.
[00:47:20.161 --> 00:47:20.801]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:47:20.842 --> 00:47:23.464]  The videos are $25.95, $20 when you order three or more.
[00:47:29.172 --> 00:47:34.074]  Again, 1-888-253-3139 or 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:47:34.154 --> 00:47:39.177]  These are great videos.
[00:47:41.498 --> 00:47:42.858]  They're waking people up.
[00:47:43.138 --> 00:47:50.862]  At least according to Trooper Dodd and the State Police of Kentucky, these videos are illegal.
[00:47:51.342 --> 00:47:53.623]  And Ron Paul speaking in Congress is illegal.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.042]  Well, we say it's still legal.
[00:47:56.082 --> 00:47:57.183]  We say it's still America.
[00:47:57.243 --> 00:47:58.264]  It's not Russia yet.
[00:47:58.585 --> 00:47:59.546]  You haven't won yet.
[00:48:00.247 --> 00:48:03.130]  And so get the videos that people think are illegal.
[00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:06.393]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andy in Texas.
[00:48:06.474 --> 00:48:07.315]  Andy, thanks for holding.
[00:48:07.355 --> 00:48:07.735]  Go ahead.
[00:48:07.755 --> 00:48:08.776]  Hi, Alex.
[00:48:09.076 --> 00:48:13.882]  I called in about 10 days ago and spoke to you about the Hurricane Andrew cover-up.
[00:48:14.662 --> 00:48:14.822]  Yes.
[00:48:14.902 --> 00:48:16.963]  And when I told you about K.T.
[00:48:17.003 --> 00:48:19.524]  Frankovich, the woman who wrote the book about the cover-up?
[00:48:19.664 --> 00:48:19.925]  Yes.
[00:48:19.965 --> 00:48:21.345]  You offered to have her on the show.
[00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:21.425]  Yes.
[00:48:21.445 --> 00:48:23.666]  And I spoke to her and she really wants to come on.
[00:48:23.766 --> 00:48:28.449]  Okay, well just send me an email at tips at InfoWars.com about it.
[00:48:28.649 --> 00:48:34.531]  Okay, and she said that she had sent in an email and wasn't getting a response and I have her home phone if you'd like that.
[00:48:34.651 --> 00:48:36.212]  Okay, let me put you on hold and we'll do that.
[00:48:36.252 --> 00:48:37.393]  Anything else on your mind, Andy?
[00:48:38.053 --> 00:48:40.134]  What do you think about the new Terry Nichols trial?
[00:48:40.174 --> 00:48:41.495]  Are you encouraged by that?
[00:48:44.558 --> 00:48:51.824]  These Oklahoma City trials are total charades, but yeah, they're having to have new trials because it came out the FBI covered up all this evidence.
[00:48:52.465 --> 00:48:53.225]  What do you think about it?
[00:48:53.826 --> 00:49:02.072]  Well, I mean, I'm hoping for the best because I think that they're having the new trial because of the final report by the Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee.
[00:49:02.212 --> 00:49:05.435]  That the government did it, but that obviously won't come out.
[00:49:05.555 --> 00:49:07.537]  But yes, they're having to have a new trial.
[00:49:07.777 --> 00:49:09.138]  I think it's all very encouraging.
[00:49:09.198 --> 00:49:10.419]  We're exposing them.
[00:49:10.759 --> 00:49:12.701]  We're exposing their whitewash commissions.
[00:49:13.706 --> 00:49:19.288]  Yes, so... Hey, what do you think about breathalyzers having to blow to start your car?
[00:49:19.508 --> 00:49:19.968]  Everyone!
[00:49:20.808 --> 00:49:22.289]  Well, I hadn't heard about that.
[00:49:22.449 --> 00:49:28.330]  Obviously, any type of mass regulation like that is very scary.
[00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:32.572]  And all over the country, it was first, oh, just the football players and band members.
[00:49:32.652 --> 00:49:43.215]  Now, this weekend, right after I read the article about everybody's going to have to breathalyzer, I hear, in San Marcos, all the children are going to have to drug test on a monthly basis.
[00:49:43.986 --> 00:49:50.111]  Uh, the government, the federal government's involved, uh... I mean, look, it's everywhere!
[00:49:50.171 --> 00:49:52.633]  This is, it's just, folk, that's not freedom!
[00:49:53.273 --> 00:49:53.533]  Right.
[00:49:53.613 --> 00:49:55.835]  Cameras in school bathrooms isn't freedom!
[00:49:58.248 --> 00:50:01.469]  But yes, I want to get into that hurricane situation.
[00:50:01.489 --> 00:50:03.930]  That is an interesting, nice little martial law example.
[00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:07.191]  Yeah, the book is called Where Heavens Meet.
[00:50:07.531 --> 00:50:16.755]  Hey, what do you think of the situation with the governor in Rhode Island saying, I didn't read the martial law bill, I'm sorry, I'm going to change the law.
[00:50:17.355 --> 00:50:18.335]  Yeah, very interesting.
[00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:19.776]  Where did you say that you read this?
[00:50:20.056 --> 00:50:20.936]  Where can I go to read this?
[00:50:21.016 --> 00:50:23.017]  It's out in the Providence Journal.
[00:50:23.097 --> 00:50:24.338]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.221]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com, too.
[00:50:28.241 --> 00:50:31.903]  It says, Governor pulls Bill on Homeland Security.
[00:50:33.743 --> 00:50:35.484]  Tarsieri, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:50:35.844 --> 00:50:37.385]  Pulls Bill on Homeland Security.
[00:50:38.125 --> 00:50:44.708]  The Governor, who says he's surprised by the reaction to his proposal, will introduce another anti-terrorism law this legislative season.
[00:50:45.849 --> 00:50:46.929]  Thanks for the call, Andy.
[00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:50.351]  Okay, Eric and Mildred and Ray and Bill and others, you're up next.
[00:50:50.451 --> 00:50:52.632]  And we do have our big guest coming up, too.
[00:50:52.652 --> 00:50:54.433]  So stay with us for that.
[00:50:56.173 --> 00:50:57.299]  And it's good to be back.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.627]  Back in the saddle again.
[00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:04.860]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:09.101]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:51:09.342 --> 00:51:12.122]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:51:12.322 --> 00:51:14.723]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:51:14.923 --> 00:51:23.566]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:51:23.746 --> 00:51:25.107]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:51:25.307 --> 00:51:29.428]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:51:29.788 --> 00:51:30.569]  We're good to go!
[00:51:48.729 --> 00:51:53.711]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:57.933]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:52:13.169 --> 00:52:15.071]  The new world order can emerge.
[00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:17.834]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:41.851]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:52:42.091 --> 00:52:47.432]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:53:56.606 --> 00:53:56.846]  P.O.
[00:53:56.886 --> 00:53:58.627]  Box 1227 Jacksonville, Oregon 97530.
[00:54:09.749 --> 00:54:12.190]  Alright, let's go to the calls as quickly as possible.
[00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:13.510]  Your questions, your comments.
[00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:16.031]  Let's get them out there and then move on to the next caller.
[00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:18.352]  Let's talk to Eric in Connecticut.
[00:54:18.432 --> 00:54:19.393]  Eric, go ahead.
[00:54:19.413 --> 00:54:22.736]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call and I'm glad you're feeling better.
[00:54:23.036 --> 00:54:23.797]  You bet, thank you.
[00:54:24.598 --> 00:54:29.703]  I just wanted to remind your listeners that this weekend, this Saturday, at the Castle Cinema up in Providence,
[00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:32.251]  I think it's from 2 p.m.
[00:54:32.312 --> 00:54:33.272]  to 6 p.m.
[00:54:33.392 --> 00:54:37.415]  There will be a showing of one of your videos, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:54:37.455 --> 00:54:37.916]  That's right.
[00:54:37.936 --> 00:54:38.837]  They're going to be showing that.
[00:54:38.857 --> 00:54:42.439]  There's information at the 1320 website.
[00:54:42.599 --> 00:54:45.301]  And I have reservations for me and a buddy to see that.
[00:54:45.702 --> 00:54:46.803]  Well, I appreciate you going.
[00:54:47.063 --> 00:54:50.505]  Yeah, and I'll give you a report when I'm done, when we've seen it.
[00:54:50.866 --> 00:54:53.848]  And I'm looking forward to it, and seeing fellow patriots up there.
[00:54:54.088 --> 00:54:57.911]  I have not seen that particular video, and I'm looking forward to seeing it.
[00:54:58.712 --> 00:55:00.193]  And one other thing, Alex.
[00:55:01.466 --> 00:55:07.829]  It's the longest video, so... Okay, did you know that Mr. Sean Hannity, you know when he went syndicated?
[00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:09.549]  9-11.
[00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:26.296]  Well, September 10th, 2001, and I heard a rumor that basically they had a big roundtable before that day, Roger Ailes and all the neocons, and they were basically tipped off and they were told, you tell the truth, your careers are toast, you go along with the line, you're going to make millions.
[00:55:27.475 --> 00:55:33.380]  Yeah, it's pretty obvious what they did, and it's a staged deal, it's a CIA operation, we know that.
[00:55:33.841 --> 00:55:43.809]  They're given their orders, what to do, what to say, how to operate, and Clear Channel owns the voting machines in many areas, and they run the candidates, and they, uh, everything!
[00:55:43.889 --> 00:55:47.052]  They own the media, they own the voting machines, they own the candidates.
[00:55:47.392 --> 00:55:51.616]  Yep, and even on the local paper, I tried to get my local paper to talk about World Trade Center 7,
[00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:54.916]  And one of the editors says, oh, I'm just not interested in it.
[00:55:54.936 --> 00:56:03.240]  And I said, you're not interested in one of the biggest stories of the last... Yeah, the owner says we blew it up on national TV, and they can just go, okay, you blew it up, great, thanks a lot.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:03.700]  Yep.
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:04.721]  Thanks for the call, Eric.
[00:56:04.741 --> 00:56:05.181]  Okay, Alex.
[00:56:05.561 --> 00:56:06.421]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[00:56:06.641 --> 00:56:08.262]  Let's talk to Mildred in Colorado.
[00:56:08.302 --> 00:56:09.223]  Mildred, go ahead.
[00:56:10.143 --> 00:56:10.923]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:11.744 --> 00:56:15.125]  I was wondering what your definition of Zionist is.
[00:56:15.145 --> 00:56:21.168]  I've been listening since the first of your show, and you were speaking then of being
[00:56:21.716 --> 00:56:24.197]  Of not being anti-semitic.
[00:56:24.257 --> 00:56:33.618]  That's right, I'm not against... But you spoke of someone who was anti-zionist and you seemed to agree with them, so I just needed to know your definition of zionist.
[00:56:34.159 --> 00:56:40.100]  Well, I'm against, say, Mecha, who says that they hate white people and blacks.
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:41.700]  What's Mecha?
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:45.341]  Ma'am, just let me answer your question, okay?
[00:56:47.387 --> 00:56:51.869]  I'm against Mecha because they say they don't like certain races and that they're the best.
[00:56:52.449 --> 00:56:55.750]  Okay, I'm against the Ku Klux Klan because they say that about whites.
[00:56:56.551 --> 00:57:06.034]  And Zionists, you know, the real King Daddy, a real Zionist, thinks that they're the best and everybody else is basically dog meat.
[00:57:06.915 --> 00:57:08.355]  And so that's who I'm talking about.
[00:57:08.415 --> 00:57:10.016]  And most Jews are not Zionists.
[00:57:10.036 --> 00:57:11.917]  So I'm against racist Jews.
[00:57:12.437 --> 00:57:13.757]  I'm against racist blacks.
[00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:15.258]  I'm against racist Germans.
[00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:17.607]  And so that's what I said.
[00:57:18.548 --> 00:57:22.071]  You don't think Zionism means that you support Israel?
[00:57:23.652 --> 00:57:24.813]  No, that's not what it means.
[00:57:25.754 --> 00:57:30.538]  If you really look at what the real Zionism is, it's a lot more than that.
[00:57:30.898 --> 00:57:36.162]  It means domination by Israel of a certain group of people.
[00:57:37.464 --> 00:57:40.066]  I can have a bunch of rabbis up and tell you that if you'd like me to.
[00:57:40.086 --> 00:57:41.407]  I would like for you to.
[00:57:42.216 --> 00:57:44.617]  Okay, well you better research what the Zionists say.
[00:57:44.677 --> 00:57:48.039]  I mean, they don't have a very good view of people who aren't Jewish.
[00:57:48.919 --> 00:57:51.320]  It's pretty racist stuff.
[00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:52.441]  Well, thank you.
[00:57:52.781 --> 00:57:54.622]  Hey, I appreciate your call, Mildred.
[00:57:54.962 --> 00:57:57.123]  And, you know, maybe we should have a debate about this.
[00:58:00.074 --> 00:58:06.398]  What I was talking about was this article, Anti-Semitism Charges Causing More Damage Than Film Could.
[00:58:06.918 --> 00:58:15.283]  Two weeks before the opening of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, online ticket merchants reported that up to half of their total sales were from the film.
[00:58:15.824 --> 00:58:20.827]  One Dallas Multiplex has received and reserved all 20 of its screens for The Passion.
[00:58:21.367 --> 00:58:23.108]  I am neither a prophet nor a movie critic.
[00:58:23.468 --> 00:58:29.032]  I am merely an orthodox rabbi using ancient Jewish wisdom to make three predictions about the movie.
[00:58:29.824 --> 00:58:34.329]  And Daniel Lapin, I totally agree with him.
[00:58:34.349 --> 00:58:35.270]  I'm going to read this later.
[00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:37.372]  This is good stuff.
[00:58:37.392 --> 00:58:39.535]  About what he has to say about it.
[00:58:40.155 --> 00:58:44.961]  I mean, no one would have thought anti-Semitism until the ADL injected this into it.
[00:58:45.621 --> 00:58:48.124]  And now it's going to cause, it probably will cause some damage.
[00:58:48.364 --> 00:58:49.345]  We'll be back with our guest.
[00:58:49.365 --> 00:58:49.766]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.423 --> 00:58:54.885]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:58:55.165 --> 00:58:58.667]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:58:58.767 --> 00:59:02.689]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:59:02.909 --> 00:59:09.072]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:09.493 --> 00:59:17.397]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:59:17.797 --> 00:59:23.161]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.

[00:59:59.023 --> 01:00:00.104]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.784 --> 01:00:01.965]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:01.985 --> 01:00:03.406]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.126 --> 01:00:04.887]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.683 --> 01:00:09.624]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.864 --> 01:00:14.005]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.706 --> 01:00:24.828]  Alright, my friends, we're now into the second hour of this global transmission against tyranny and defense of liberty.
[01:00:25.669 --> 01:00:33.631]  Coming up later in the show, they're saying they're about to capture Bin Laden, this time out of the mainstream news
[01:00:34.582 --> 01:00:41.992]  Reports out of the Sunday Telegraph, out of the Washington Times, and we believe this is going to be a stage capture.
[01:00:42.312 --> 01:00:45.477]  We've been saying this for over two years from my White House sources.
[01:00:46.618 --> 01:00:50.664]  Also, we'll get into anti-Semitism charges causing more damage than
[01:00:51.542 --> 01:00:57.867]  Film could, from a rabbi that wrote a great editorial, Daniel Lappin, that's going to come up later.
[01:00:58.408 --> 01:01:04.212]  Also more on the Rhode Island governor withdrawing their martial law legislation.
[01:01:04.252 --> 01:01:06.995]  He's now apologized and said that he hadn't read the bill.
[01:01:07.615 --> 01:01:09.276]  You see, oh yes, you've read the bill.
[01:01:09.396 --> 01:01:10.916]  You counted on us not reading it.
[01:01:11.216 --> 01:01:12.997]  Now that we have, you've had to withdraw it.
[01:01:13.057 --> 01:01:14.977]  More on that coming up.
[01:01:15.017 --> 01:01:15.998]  Very serious issue.
[01:01:16.618 --> 01:01:21.099]  Also, Supreme Court upholds judges' right to compel medication.
[01:01:21.659 --> 01:01:24.920]  So now we have judges giving other judges police powers.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.661]  You gotta love it.
[01:01:26.841 --> 01:01:28.401]  Soviet-style police powers.
[01:01:29.062 --> 01:01:32.443]  CBS News, years of FBI agent crimes detailed.
[01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:36.044]  That's coming up later in the broadcast, and I'll also get into some of
[01:01:37.085 --> 01:01:45.967]  Well, my comments on Hutton Gibson's supposed comments concerning, well, some interesting issues.
[01:01:46.127 --> 01:01:50.208]  And I do have some comments on this, so that's coming up later as well.
[01:01:51.349 --> 01:02:01.151]  Before we go to our first guest, who I'm honored to have, well, our guest for this hour, I wanted to just remind you that Dr. David Kelly
[01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:26.001]  uh... was the head of the level four porton down bio weapons lab in wilshire england and he was then the head british weapons inspector who'd been pro war he then came back and leaked information that look i'm a hawk for this war but i'm not gonna lie saddam doesn't have weapons of mass destruction and tony blair misused my assessment
[01:02:26.664 --> 01:02:28.605]  Well, suddenly he wound up dead.
[01:02:28.705 --> 01:02:30.406]  He told British and U.S.
[01:02:30.466 --> 01:02:34.849]  colleagues that I'm going to be murdered and found dead in the woods if I don't shut up.
[01:02:35.169 --> 01:02:36.750]  This is now mainstream news.
[01:02:38.251 --> 01:02:46.116]  Three top doctors have gone public, have looked at the autopsy results and say he clearly did not commit suicide.
[01:02:46.136 --> 01:02:52.921]  And we have that posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:52.961 --> 01:02:54.942]  So a lot of people are starting to go public on this.
[01:02:57.153 --> 01:03:05.327]  There were rumors of this last week that somebody who'd been inside the British government had sources that said that they could confirm that Dr. David Kelly had been killed.
[01:03:06.142 --> 01:03:14.164]  But the folks that got that story, I guess, didn't take time out to go ahead and get in contact with the individual who was bringing forward this information himself.
[01:03:14.284 --> 01:03:15.024]  We've done that.
[01:03:15.384 --> 01:03:22.786]  He's coming up here in just a few minutes, and we're so honored to have him with us here on the show.
[01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:27.367]  He's Michael Shrimpton, and Michael Shrimpton has a long bio.
[01:03:27.407 --> 01:03:30.608]  I did some research on him over the weekend.
[01:03:31.684 --> 01:03:37.026]  Michael Shrimpton, of course, is a national security lawyer.
[01:03:37.106 --> 01:03:39.627]  That is Barrister in Government Matters.
[01:03:40.427 --> 01:03:44.849]  He's written for the Journal of International Security Affairs.
[01:03:45.169 --> 01:03:52.992]  He has given advice and briefed the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
[01:03:53.232 --> 01:03:54.012]  That's the U.S.
[01:03:54.572 --> 01:03:54.932]  Senate.
[01:03:54.992 --> 01:03:59.234]  He's given speeches and consulted all over Western Europe and the United States.
[01:04:00.206 --> 01:04:03.088]  And of course he's been an invited guest of the State Department.
[01:04:03.388 --> 01:04:06.270]  So he's a mainstream guy and I was very impressed talking to him.
[01:04:06.571 --> 01:04:08.652]  We're about to break for a quick three minute break.
[01:04:08.952 --> 01:04:12.255]  Come back and join a bunch of stations that carry news during this segment.
[01:04:12.855 --> 01:04:16.077]  And I'll briefly recap who our guest is and we'll go to him.
[01:04:16.438 --> 01:04:18.099]  Michael Scrimpton is on the line with us.
[01:04:18.679 --> 01:04:26.261]  Again, we're going to break and come back, and he has some bombshell information for you from his sources inside MI5 and MI6.
[01:04:26.301 --> 01:04:35.023]  Again, he's a national security lawyer, that is Barrister, who has advised the United States Senate Intelligence Committee.
[01:04:36.544 --> 01:04:42.666]  So, you want to have your tape recorders going, you want to call your friends and family, and tell them to tune into this show.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:51.544]  One of our great writers, Simon, is going to have an article written for us by this evening that will be posted on the websites as well.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:19.222]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:19.602 --> 01:05:20.102]  We listened.
[01:05:20.443 --> 01:05:25.665]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:26.085 --> 01:05:27.446]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:27.806 --> 01:05:35.189]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:38.731]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by
[01:05:45.183 --> 01:05:57.193]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.413 --> 01:06:01.837]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.977 --> 01:06:06.361]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:06.401 --> 01:06:07.763]  The New World Order.
[01:06:08.563 --> 01:06:09.244]  Hannah Murray.
[01:06:09.525 --> 01:06:13.769]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.809 --> 01:06:20.737]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.877 --> 01:06:22.880]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:33.583]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.863 --> 01:06:39.244]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:07:57.688 --> 01:07:58.348]  Big Brother.
[01:07:59.009 --> 01:08:00.069]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:00.769 --> 01:08:01.889]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.529 --> 01:08:03.350]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:04.870]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.663 --> 01:08:09.626]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.846 --> 01:08:13.969]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:22.516]  We're going to have an article this evening on the websites.
[01:08:22.936 --> 01:08:26.419]  It'll appear first on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:30.102]  And I want to thank Simon
[01:08:31.084 --> 01:08:40.492]  And I want to thank Rowena and I want to thank Paul Watson and all the folks that have been working on this story and for getting us this guest.
[01:08:40.933 --> 01:08:48.199]  And again, he's Michael Shrimpton and a national security lawyer or barrister.
[01:08:48.459 --> 01:08:51.081]  And he's written for major anti-terrorism journals.
[01:08:51.602 --> 01:08:58.207]  He has given his expert advice to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for the U.S.
[01:08:58.308 --> 01:08:58.628]  Senate.
[01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:01.131]  And the bio goes on and on.
[01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:05.055]  He's also been involved in a lot of prominent high-profile cases in England.
[01:09:05.075 --> 01:09:07.418]  I came across that in my research on him.
[01:09:07.838 --> 01:09:08.960]  And he's a really nice fellow.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.301]  During the break, I was talking to him.
[01:09:10.341 --> 01:09:13.645]  I said, you know, I hope you don't end up in the woods like Dr. David Kelly.
[01:09:14.186 --> 01:09:17.269]  And he said, well, no, by going public, you protect yourself.
[01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:18.531]  And that's the truth.
[01:09:19.031 --> 01:09:22.532]  For other government whistleblowers, telling the truth is what protects you.
[01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.693]  If you covertly leak something, that's what's dangerous.
[01:09:25.753 --> 01:09:35.077]  So, he protects himself by going on air, and obviously because of all of his sources, he's a great source for all of us.
[01:09:35.997 --> 01:09:38.358]  And Michael, good to have you on the show with us.
[01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:41.839]  Good day.
[01:09:43.159 --> 01:09:44.720]  Just for folks,
[01:09:45.595 --> 01:09:49.099]  Around the world who aren't very familiar with Dr. David Kelly.
[01:09:49.139 --> 01:09:50.301]  Hard to believe people aren't.
[01:09:50.862 --> 01:10:02.415]  Can you recap who he was, what happened to him, and then from your sources, you even know down to the specifics of how they killed him, and from your sources, who was behind the killing.
[01:10:02.435 --> 01:10:03.597]  Can you just go through it for us?
[01:10:04.017 --> 01:10:08.719]  Yes, David Kelly was probably the most respected microbiologist in the United Kingdom.
[01:10:09.199 --> 01:10:11.700]  Certainly one who specialized in weapons of mass destruction.
[01:10:12.421 --> 01:10:17.123]  He was the head of our main WMD laboratory at Portmanteau and Wiltshire.
[01:10:17.943 --> 01:10:25.026]  He was very involved in the dismantling, verification of the dismantling of the Soviet WMD programs after the end of the Cold War.
[01:10:25.787 --> 01:10:30.889]  He spent some time inside the bad old USSR.
[01:10:31.979 --> 01:10:38.125]  He was the senior British inspector on UNSCOM, the UN mission inside Iraq.
[01:10:38.865 --> 01:10:41.607]  He spent some considerable time in Baghdad.
[01:10:42.308 --> 01:10:52.536]  He was working very closely with our overseas intelligence service, MI6, or the Secret Intelligence Service, and he was a major, high-value British intelligence asset.
[01:10:52.556 --> 01:10:53.077]  He was a good man.
[01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:57.595]  Decorated, awarded the CMG, Commander of St.
[01:10:57.615 --> 01:10:58.156]  Michael and St.
[01:10:58.176 --> 01:11:05.909]  George, highly regarded and well liked too within the British intelligence community and also respected in the United States.
[01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:17.904]  And then suddenly, Tony Blair smearing him in the press, and he ends up dead, and the witnesses, according to the London Times and their publications, saw four men in black uniforms standing around him.
[01:11:18.264 --> 01:11:20.406]  They run off, and oh, it's a suicide.
[01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:30.075]  Go over the whole controversy of... I mean, Dr. David Kelly was a hawk for the war, but he wasn't going to put out false intelligence.
[01:11:30.916 --> 01:11:32.738]  Go through that for folks that missed out on it.
[01:11:33.158 --> 01:11:52.336]  Well yes, David Kelly briefed in a British BBC journalist called Andrew Gilligan and all suspect to another journalist off of the BBC television's Newsnight programme and he briefed in both journalists along the lines that the case for the WMD case for war with Iraq had been exaggerated.
[01:11:52.356 --> 01:11:54.959]  There's a lot of dispute about exactly what was said and what wasn't said.
[01:11:56.205 --> 01:12:05.908]  The BBC Today programme, which is the leading radio current affairs programme, led with a story from Andrew Gilligan, which didn't name David Kelly as Andrew's source.
[01:12:06.569 --> 01:12:14.911]  Now, we know that David Kelly was, and my own intelligence sources confirmed that before the BBC itself confirmed it on Sunday the 20th of July.
[01:12:15.912 --> 01:12:18.193]  David Kelly was outed in the media.
[01:12:18.653 --> 01:12:22.494]  Big dispute as to who authorised his name to be given to the media.
[01:12:23.308 --> 01:12:26.912]  And he was asked to appear before a committee in the House of Commons.
[01:12:27.032 --> 01:12:34.900]  There was a lot of controversy about what the government had been told, how truthful a dossier that they had prepared on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was.
[01:12:35.695 --> 01:12:41.939]  And shortly after he gave evidence to the House of Commons, he was found dead on Friday 18th of July of last year.
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:43.440]  He was found dead.
[01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:46.462]  There is a dispute about exactly where he was found.
[01:12:46.702 --> 01:12:58.310]  According to the official version of events, he was found dead in a copse or a wood at a place called Harrowdown Hill between the village where he lived and the River Thames.
[01:13:00.003 --> 01:13:08.208]  But the forensic tents, it's noticeable, Alex, that the forensic tents that were set up by the local police force, Thames Valley Police, were actually set up in the field.
[01:13:09.108 --> 01:13:18.953]  Why you would have someone killed in the woods and have the police tents over the scene of the crime set up in the field, no one has yet been able to explain to my satisfaction.
[01:13:19.894 --> 01:13:28.899]  Now, the government were blamed for causing the death, but the way the government were criticised was this.
[01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:36.617]  That they had caused his name to be leaked to the media, that had put him under intolerable pressure and he had allegedly committed suicide.
[01:13:37.197 --> 01:13:45.023]  The initial media reports all went with suicide and the mainstream media in the UK is still reporting it as a suicide.
[01:13:45.043 --> 01:13:57.573]  The government responded very quickly and brought in a law lord, Lord Hutton, who had previously been Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland and the Hutton Inquiry has very recently reported that Lord Hutton
[01:13:58.191 --> 01:14:00.713]  Didn't challenge the suicide verdict.
[01:14:01.534 --> 01:14:06.618]  There was no cross-examination of witnesses before the Hutton Inquiry as to the cause of death.
[01:14:07.278 --> 01:14:13.523]  It was assumed that it was suicide and the BBC were essentially blamed for poor reporting.
[01:14:13.563 --> 01:14:14.544]  The government were let off the hook.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:19.002]  The Hutton Report, I'm sorry to say, is widely seen as a whitewash, and it's been rubbished.
[01:14:19.162 --> 01:14:33.731]  A very senior British intelligence officer recently retired, a lieutenant colonel, Crispin Black, who was on the Defence Intelligence staff until 2002, basically described the report as a laughingstock, and I respectfully agree.
[01:14:34.071 --> 01:14:38.554]  Yeah, I've seen major polls where over two-thirds of British people believe it's complete fraud.
[01:14:38.594 --> 01:14:44.317]  I mean, obviously, Tony Blair hires one of his cronies to come in and say, oh, you didn't do anything wrong.
[01:14:45.178 --> 01:14:55.324]  And then even that's a whitewash of a larger whitewash, because obviously, according to the medical reports, the coroner's report, the doctors that have looked at it,
[01:14:56.767 --> 01:15:04.672]  The suicide verdict, that's a fraud itself, and let's go into your sources and what really happened to Dr. David Kelly.
[01:15:04.972 --> 01:15:08.354]  Absolutely, although I wouldn't be allowed to say that Tony Blair had hired a judge.
[01:15:08.574 --> 01:15:13.177]  You understand that in England we don't hire judges.
[01:15:13.197 --> 01:15:21.461]  The judge is on the state payroll anyway, and I wouldn't want to be thought of as suggesting that anybody had put a little extra funds Lord Hutton's way.
[01:15:21.601 --> 01:15:24.223]  I'm quite sure Lord Hutton took no extra payment.
[01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:31.335]  Well, what I'm saying is that obviously Hutton's been involved in what's been called whitewashes in the past.
[01:15:31.635 --> 01:15:36.679]  The report, I'm sorry to say, with respect to Lord Hutton, the report is a complete whitewash.
[01:15:36.879 --> 01:15:42.022]  Well, I mean, you have a government institution whitewashing for another government institution.
[01:15:42.343 --> 01:15:42.923]  Well, exactly.
[01:15:43.043 --> 01:15:46.285]  And this is the problem with appointing senior judges to hold inquiries.
[01:15:46.346 --> 01:15:48.167]  There's been a lot of adverse comment in England.
[01:15:49.407 --> 01:15:52.108]  The senior judge is, by definition, part of the establishment.
[01:15:52.489 --> 01:15:53.329]  It's very difficult.
[01:15:53.429 --> 01:15:58.811]  It's very difficult for the judge, of course, because if he whitewashes the government, everybody says, well, it is a whitewash.
[01:15:59.451 --> 01:16:05.313]  If he blames the government, well, it's asking too much of a senior judge to go around blaming the government.
[01:16:05.353 --> 01:16:06.594]  It's not what senior judges do.
[01:16:06.914 --> 01:16:08.014]  I mean, what do you expect?
[01:16:08.074 --> 01:16:12.295]  I mean, here we have it where Janet Reno hires somebody to investigate Waco.
[01:16:12.955 --> 01:16:16.036]  I mean, she literally appoints the investigator.
[01:16:16.496 --> 01:16:19.137]  We have Bush controlling the 9-11 panel.
[01:16:19.177 --> 01:16:20.777]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:16:21.637 --> 01:16:27.018]  But getting into the specifics of Dr. David Kelly's clear murder, let's go over that.
[01:16:27.378 --> 01:16:28.018]  Well, absolutely.
[01:16:28.058 --> 01:16:32.019]  Now, on Saturday 19th of July, David was murdered on the 17th.
[01:16:32.319 --> 01:16:36.020]  On Saturday the 19th, within 48 hours of the murder,
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:42.885]  I was contacted by a British intelligence officer who had told me he'd been murdered.
[01:16:42.905 --> 01:16:44.145]  That didn't take it by surprise.
[01:16:44.205 --> 01:16:46.527]  I was suspicious of the suicide theory from the word go.
[01:16:47.147 --> 01:16:59.436]  Now that source told me he'd done some digging and discovered that, he didn't name names, but it discovered that it had been known about in Whitehall prior to the 17th of July that David Kelly was going to be taken down.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:04.544]  Now, normally with a suicide, Alex, you appreciate we don't like people knowing in advance.
[01:17:05.025 --> 01:17:09.208]  If people know in advance of the death, that normally points away from suicide.
[01:17:09.609 --> 01:17:09.929]  Yes.
[01:17:10.289 --> 01:17:11.170]  I have.
[01:17:12.231 --> 01:17:12.632]  Exactly.
[01:17:13.192 --> 01:17:20.899]  Now, a lot of work has been done since the murder, and there's been particularly a great deal of medical research.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:23.221]  It's absolutely clear that David was murdered.
[01:17:23.321 --> 01:17:25.944]  The suicide theory just doesn't hold water at all.
[01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:31.488]  The official version of events is that he took some Coproxamol tablets.
[01:17:31.528 --> 01:17:36.729]  Now, Coproxamol is available in England only by prescription.
[01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:44.251]  There is a problem with that because there is no evidence that David Kelly was ever prescribed Coproxamol.
[01:17:44.711 --> 01:17:47.232]  Now, Coproxamol, I think, is available in the United States.
[01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:53.253]  It's a combination of dextropropothene and paracetamol in a ratio of 1 to 10.
[01:17:54.354 --> 01:17:56.114]  It's not a very powerful painkiller.
[01:17:56.798 --> 01:18:03.482]  And the level of Coproxamol in the bloodstream, according to the official toxicology report, was about one-third, i.e.
[01:18:03.562 --> 01:18:04.282]  not enough to kill him.
[01:18:05.443 --> 01:18:12.947]  Now, 29 tablets were allegedly missing, or were missing, from a packet of Coproxamol found by the body.
[01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:18.690]  The problem is that there is only one-fifth of a tablet in the stomach, and there's no evidence of substantial vomiting.
[01:18:19.471 --> 01:18:24.234]  There is a little bit of vomit found on the body, but not much, and there's no analysis done of the material.
[01:18:26.271 --> 01:18:34.197]  The stomach contents do not support the suggestion that he ingested 29 Caproxamol tablets.
[01:18:35.678 --> 01:18:53.369]  Interestingly, the initial media reports, and when we look at staged suicides or political assassinations, I find it very useful to concentrate on the early media reports, because if there is a cover-up, usually the cover-up kicks in after 12, 24, 36 hours.
[01:18:53.409 --> 01:18:55.551]  The first media reports are very often the most accurate.
[01:18:55.987 --> 01:18:58.989]  Particularly if they're coming from local news organisations.
[01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:04.834]  And the early media reports made no mention of a bottle of water.
[01:19:05.615 --> 01:19:17.564]  The theory is, Alex, that he took these co-proximal tablets, having set out on a walk in the course of which he was going to commit suicide, and took with him a bottle of water to swallow the tablets.
[01:19:18.225 --> 01:19:22.108]  Problem, no mention in early media reports of any bottle of water.
[01:19:22.428 --> 01:19:24.630]  That detail was only added in after
[01:19:25.733 --> 01:19:32.477]  A group of concerned people in England, professionals, called the Kelly Group, had made the point, and it was already out into the open.
[01:19:33.557 --> 01:19:35.818]  Now, the suicide version of it can't be right.
[01:19:36.539 --> 01:19:43.102]  He was found with one wrist slashed, and the ulnar artery, which is the artery... Tell you what, we've got a break.
[01:19:43.122 --> 01:19:51.666]  We're going to come back and go over the circumstantial evidence, and then your sources inside intelligence that say, hey, we got the word, he was about to be killed, and then who killed him?
[01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:52.487]  We'll talk about that too.
[01:19:53.147 --> 01:19:57.869]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:19:58.089 --> 01:20:01.530]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:04.210]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[01:20:04.450 --> 01:20:13.053]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.

[01:21:52.327 --> 01:21:58.551]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:21:58.691 --> 01:22:04.854]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:22:05.135 --> 01:22:13.600]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.

[01:22:52.245 --> 01:22:55.147]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.

[01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:02.362]  We've got a longer segment coming up.
[01:24:02.422 --> 01:24:11.805]  Plenty of time to go over this evidence with our guests, and our guests would like to take calls, so later in the interview, if you'd like to talk to our guests, the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:11.825 --> 01:24:11.905]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:11.985 --> 01:24:14.406]  Now, we're talking to Michael Shrimpton.
[01:24:21.994 --> 01:24:24.275]  And he's a national security barrister in England.
[01:24:25.075 --> 01:24:32.259]  He has given testimony and advice to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for the U.S.
[01:24:32.319 --> 01:24:32.619]  Senate.
[01:24:33.366 --> 01:24:39.711]  And he's obviously very knowledgeable about intelligence and the activities of intelligence agencies.
[01:24:39.991 --> 01:24:42.473]  He has a lot of sources in MI5 and MI6.
[01:24:42.934 --> 01:24:53.442]  You just heard him talk about one source inside British Intelligence that said they got word that Kelly was about to be killed by the government a week or so before he actually died.
[01:24:53.482 --> 01:24:57.025]  I want to go back into that in more detail coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:24:59.275 --> 01:25:09.140]  Mr. Shrimpton was then going over the material evidence of the murder, and you've gotten to the point of the slitting of the wrist.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.641]  Yeah, he clearly didn't slit his own wrist.
[01:25:12.981 --> 01:25:22.966]  The idea that he exsanguinated, that he died from hemorrhaging, he bled out from a cut to one wrist only, to the ulnar artery is just nonsense, Alex.
[01:25:23.875 --> 01:25:28.096]  Firstly, the artery that was cut was the ulnar artery, which is more difficult to reach.
[01:25:28.136 --> 01:25:29.757]  It's on the little finger side of the hand.
[01:25:30.157 --> 01:25:31.557]  It's deeper than the radial artery.
[01:25:32.317 --> 01:25:39.600]  Why go for an artery deep in the wrist when you can slit an artery much closer to the surface of the skin?
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.020]  That's the first problem.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:48.242]  Second problem, he, according to the autopsy report, he severed or transected the artery
[01:25:48.905 --> 01:25:52.426]  But once you transect an artery, we have something called vasoconstriction.
[01:25:52.786 --> 01:25:55.346]  The artery retracts and that promotes clotting.
[01:25:55.486 --> 01:25:59.507]  It's very difficult to bleed out if you sever one artery only.
[01:26:00.067 --> 01:26:10.029]  And I would second that with David Halpin, a doctor, a trauma and orthopedic surgeon, as well as Stephen Frost, specialist in diagnostics.
[01:26:10.529 --> 01:26:14.550]  I mean, there's a whole bunch of top-level doctors saying this is a complete fraud.
[01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:15.170]  Exactly.
[01:26:15.551 --> 01:26:21.596]  One doctor went around promoting the official version of Vents and attacked these doctors in the Guardian newspaper in England and talked about slashing wrists.
[01:26:22.096 --> 01:26:26.560]  Well, David Kelly on the official version of Vents didn't slash his wrists, plural.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:28.161]  He slashed one wrist only.
[01:26:28.542 --> 01:26:29.663]  It's highly unusual.
[01:26:30.584 --> 01:26:33.826]  Firstly, wrist slashing is not an effective method of committing suicide.
[01:26:34.887 --> 01:26:39.291]  One of the reasons people do it in a bath of hot water is that it keeps the temperature high.
[01:26:39.887 --> 01:26:47.811]  Yeah, if you're out in the open, if you're not keeping the temperature high, the wrists, the arteries will not stay dilated.
[01:26:48.711 --> 01:26:53.313]  It is very difficult indeed to bleed out in the open, even if you split both wrists.
[01:26:54.354 --> 01:27:00.877]  Splitting one wrist only, much less blood loss and we have conflicting accounts of the amount of blood found by the body.
[01:27:01.737 --> 01:27:08.060]  The most reliable eyewitnesses in my judgment are probably the paramedics who found him and
[01:27:08.607 --> 01:27:10.529]  They talk about comparatively little blood loss.
[01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:16.413]  There is no solid evidence that a lot of blood had left the body.
[01:27:16.433 --> 01:27:20.456]  There were no adequate measurements of the amount of blood left in the major vessels in the heart and so on.
[01:27:20.716 --> 01:27:29.843]  Now, talking to you earlier today, it's pretty clear that they drug him up, then as he's dying, slit his wrist to create this scene.
[01:27:30.303 --> 01:27:35.267]  From your sources inside the intelligence community, what really happened to Dr. David Kelly?
[01:27:35.874 --> 01:28:02.548]  Well, in my judgment, based on conversations with sources and with medical experts, and a great deal of work has been done over this since the murder, he was probably murdered by a combination of an injection, not through tablets, but an intravenous injection of dextropropoxythene and paracetamol, the constituents of coproxamol, and a muscle relaxant called succinylcholine.
[01:28:03.366 --> 01:28:06.309]  Succinylcholine is a favourite method of assassinating people.
[01:28:06.369 --> 01:28:10.792]  It's used by intelligence agencies, particularly the French DGSE.
[01:28:11.713 --> 01:28:19.699]  Succinylcholine, although it's used therapeutically for treating, facilitating intubation and so on, can be lethal.
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:27.826]  And in combination with the constituents of coproxamol, 30mg would probably have been a lethal dose.
[01:28:28.419 --> 01:28:36.265]  The problem for someone investigating an assassination by succinylcholine is that it metabolizes even after death.
[01:28:37.043 --> 01:28:38.884]  And you only pick up the metabolites.
[01:28:39.104 --> 01:28:47.568]  In other words, it's one of those drugs that leaves no trace, unless you have a very expert pathologist who really knows what he or she is doing.
[01:28:47.808 --> 01:28:51.410]  Now, all you can find is what it metabolizes into.
[01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:53.471]  You cannot find the original chemical.
[01:28:53.851 --> 01:28:54.251]  Exactly.
[01:28:54.391 --> 01:28:57.593]  So you have to look for the enzymes it metabolizes into.
[01:28:58.253 --> 01:28:59.994]  You won't find any trace of the original drug.
[01:29:00.294 --> 01:29:01.415]  Well, it's like with AIDS.
[01:29:01.455 --> 01:29:06.157]  You look for the antibodies, because you can't find the virus.
[01:29:06.337 --> 01:29:07.198]  Well, very effectively, yes.
[01:29:07.579 --> 01:29:13.568]  And it's fairly clear that the slash to the wrist was done to disguise the puncture wound.
[01:29:13.628 --> 01:29:17.354]  There's no puncture wound, but of course the slash to the wrist would have disguised it.
[01:29:17.822 --> 01:29:25.167]  Now, the palmar face, or the palmar face of the wrist, effectively the inside face of the wrist, is a very popular method.
[01:29:25.307 --> 01:29:28.709]  You know, kinesiologists would use it to inject.
[01:29:28.969 --> 01:29:38.596]  It's quite realistic to suppose that David Kelley was injected in the wrist with the muscle relaxant and the dextrofiproxafene and the... Tell you what, we've got a break again.
[01:29:38.616 --> 01:29:41.738]  We'll come back and get into your sources and take some calls.
[01:29:43.499 --> 01:29:44.400]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:46.401]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.427 --> 01:29:50.094]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.194 --> 01:29:53.634]  Gold.
[01:29:53.975 --> 01:29:55.276]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:29:55.536 --> 01:30:01.621]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:30:01.801 --> 01:30:05.625]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:30:05.985 --> 01:30:07.866]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:30:07.927 --> 01:30:10.208]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:30:10.349 --> 01:30:17.995]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:30:17.995 --> 01:30:18.856]  We're good to go.
[01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:37.311]  We're good to go.
[01:30:52.327 --> 01:30:54.149]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[01:30:54.349 --> 01:30:57.212]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?

[01:31:53.475 --> 01:31:55.537]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[01:31:55.717 --> 01:31:57.357]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[01:31:57.478 --> 01:32:05.482]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[01:32:05.722 --> 01:32:12.145]  Imagine, hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[01:32:12.325 --> 01:32:13.586]  Just a few of the many selections.
[01:32:13.726 --> 01:32:13.986]  I think so.
[01:32:29.855 --> 01:32:33.838]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking or canoeing.
[01:32:34.058 --> 01:32:36.080]  No fires allowed, hot meals still are.

[01:32:54.182 --> 01:32:56.923]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:32:56.943 --> 01:33:00.885]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:04.207 --> 01:33:06.108]  Folks, this is very, very important.
[01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:11.551]  Because Tony Blair is a minion of the globalists.
[01:33:12.451 --> 01:33:16.373]  He's the tool who's trying to destroy British national sovereignty.
[01:33:17.699 --> 01:33:24.563]  To bring the British people under the dominance of the unelected, unaccountable European Union, whether they like it or not.
[01:33:25.183 --> 01:33:34.688]  He's been promised the EU headship under a new, expanded, empowered EU, if he can get Britain into it.
[01:33:35.429 --> 01:33:37.490]  He lied about the weapons of mass destruction.
[01:33:38.461 --> 01:33:48.347]  It's clear that if Tony Blair was to have been exposed, that would certainly hurt those in Europe that want to get rid of British sovereignty.
[01:33:49.107 --> 01:34:03.416]  And talking to Michael Shrimpton, our guest, our intelligence expert, who has his sources over there in England, talking to you earlier before the show, you talked about your sources, the evidence you have that
[01:34:04.759 --> 01:34:18.363]  It looks like that it was elements of British intelligence or of the government using French intelligence to go and do their dirty work, which by the way is a standard operation.
[01:34:18.763 --> 01:34:25.346]  If intelligence agencies are getting rid of some of their own people, they will generally use a sister agency in a sister country.
[01:34:27.166 --> 01:34:33.028]  I know this is very delicate, Michael, but can you go over what you talked to me off-air about?
[01:34:34.162 --> 01:34:34.822]  Yes, Alex.
[01:34:35.282 --> 01:34:45.685]  Firstly, I should make it clear, I have absolutely no indication that anybody in either of the British intelligence agencies, MI5, the Security Service, or MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service, is being involved.
[01:34:45.985 --> 01:34:50.946]  On the contrary, my sources are telling me that both services are extremely unhappy.
[01:34:51.566 --> 01:34:55.167]  Now, the indications are, and you understand I'm being cautious aren't I,
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:35:04.327]  There are indications pointing towards an involvement by the French External Intelligence Agency, the DGSE, or Direction Générale de la Sécurité Exterieure.
[01:35:04.547 --> 01:35:07.970]  But obviously they've got a liaison within the government, the British government.
[01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:10.472]  They've got to have someone authorizing this.
[01:35:10.512 --> 01:35:14.575]  Are you saying it's just a rogue element wanting to get rid of somebody who could mess up the EU?
[01:35:14.955 --> 01:35:24.483]  No, again, I've got to be obviously careful on air, but the indications are that the tasking for the assassination came from within the UK.
[01:35:25.243 --> 01:35:28.606]  But I can't name any individual official or minister.
[01:35:29.487 --> 01:35:40.537]  The taskings generated in the UK went to Paris, was then okayed in Paris, and on the information available to me, the operational agency for this assassination was DGSE.
[01:35:41.478 --> 01:35:48.204]  Now, there are also indications, and I'm, again, obviously Alex, you appreciate I'm expressing myself with caution here,
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:36:05.249]  There are indications that DGSE, in order to false flag the assassination should their team be discovered, used Iraqi intelligence assets from the Iraqi Muqabirat Agency that were available in Damascus after the fall of Baghdad.
[01:36:05.949 --> 01:36:09.711]  And I have one source suggesting that an Iraqi team
[01:36:10.273 --> 01:36:24.120]  That's today, an ex-Muqabirat team recruited in Damascus with the assistance of the Syrian intelligence operation, also the Muqabirat, were flown into Corsica in the seven days prior to the assassination of David Kelly.
[01:36:24.815 --> 01:36:34.746]  Now the standard French practice when they carry out assassinations is to take their own team out and I am very doubtful that any of the people involved directly in the assassination of David Kelly are still alive.
[01:36:34.766 --> 01:36:40.031]  It would be highly unusual for the French to permit anyone involved in the assassination for them to
[01:36:41.752 --> 01:36:43.833]  Well, we've seen this in the past.
[01:36:43.853 --> 01:36:54.455]  You've had the big controversy that BBC's reported on about British intelligence using Al-Qaeda individuals to try to kill Muammar Gaddafi.
[01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:56.176]  I mean, this is a classic deal.
[01:36:56.216 --> 01:37:05.538]  Of course, the Iraqis were allies during the 80s, and so a lot of these guys were trained in the US, trained in England, trained in France, and then bringing these assets back in.
[01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:10.060]  Yeah, that was a mess.
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:12.461]  We could spend another hour on that, Alex.
[01:37:13.301 --> 01:37:17.082]  Whoever authorised that operation did not know what they were doing.
[01:37:17.102 --> 01:37:18.523]  That was just a total shambles.
[01:37:19.236 --> 01:37:27.762]  I mean, wouldn't these Iraqis know that they were doing this hit, that they were going to be in deep trouble afterwards, or were they told, you don't have a choice?
[01:37:28.282 --> 01:37:28.842]  Not necessarily.
[01:37:28.862 --> 01:37:31.164]  They may not have worked for French Intelligence before.
[01:37:31.304 --> 01:37:35.487]  If you were offered a job by French Intelligence, I would turn it down.
[01:37:37.888 --> 01:37:44.673]  Anybody approached by French Intelligence to do a hit, I would strongly advise them to turn it down or increase their life insurance.
[01:37:45.203 --> 01:37:49.615]  They were probably, assuming it was Iraqis, and I can't be positive.
[01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:53.241]  There are indications pointing towards an Iraqi involvement.
[01:37:53.281 --> 01:37:55.122]  I can't be positive about DGSE.
[01:37:56.002 --> 01:38:04.906]  I have a range of sources, as you've said, and those sources point to Paris, and they point towards DGSE.
[01:38:05.247 --> 01:38:07.868]  Now, DGSE is the equivalent of an MI6.
[01:38:08.008 --> 01:38:08.808]  It's outward.
[01:38:09.088 --> 01:38:10.869]  DGSU is internal.
[01:38:10.889 --> 01:38:17.152]  It's the DST, Direction du Surveillance de la Territoire, which is the internal agency.
[01:38:18.443 --> 01:38:21.666]  And the DST are internal, DGSE are external.
[01:38:22.527 --> 01:38:23.628]  Let's just put it this way, Alex.
[01:38:23.668 --> 01:38:31.194]  The operation has all the hallmarks of DGSE and British Intelligence, on my sources, are furious.
[01:38:31.314 --> 01:38:34.717]  They're not happy at all because David, after all, was a British Intelligence asset.
[01:38:35.137 --> 01:38:49.871]  Well, by the way, my webmaster, Paul Watson, has talked to a major British news reporter who has talked directly to British intelligence, and they said months ago, I'm talking six months ago, the same thing that you just said here.
[01:38:50.666 --> 01:38:55.850]  Oh, that is interesting, because that would be almost certainly a different source to mine.
[01:38:56.110 --> 01:38:57.751]  It might be, we're talking to the same people.
[01:38:58.111 --> 01:39:00.113]  One of the problems in the intelligence world is loopback.
[01:39:01.013 --> 01:39:13.782]  Something you think is independent confirmation may turn out to be... No, I understand, but I mean clearly from the circumstantial, from the material evidence, you've got murder, you've got a cover-up, you've got a spin, you've got a motive.
[01:39:14.162 --> 01:39:20.826]  You've got him telling the US doctor, his colleague, if I don't shut up, I'm going to be found dead in the woods, they're going to kill me.
[01:39:20.846 --> 01:39:22.847]  I mean, this is all public now.
[01:39:23.247 --> 01:39:26.128]  We have him saying, they're going to kill me and put me in the woods.
[01:39:26.849 --> 01:39:32.091]  You said that you've talked to intelligence people who said, yeah, they knew that Kelly was about to get it before he even died.
[01:39:32.131 --> 01:39:33.372]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:39:33.592 --> 01:39:43.057]  Yeah, the source that spoke to me on 19th July, after the assassination, because you see, this source was a friend of David Kelly's.
[01:39:43.497 --> 01:39:45.179]  And so David was a friend of a friend.
[01:39:46.139 --> 01:39:47.781]  And this source obviously was not very happy.
[01:39:47.801 --> 01:39:50.923]  It didn't take him five minutes to work out that this was murder, not suicide.
[01:39:51.704 --> 01:39:59.410]  He then made inquiries, and he established from other sources that the murder was known about in advance, i.e.
[01:39:59.470 --> 01:40:06.675]  the death of David Kelly was known about within a section of Whitehall prior to the 17th of July.
[01:40:07.416 --> 01:40:08.657]  And he was very unhappy.
[01:40:09.358 --> 01:40:15.483]  And that source came through to me and effectively I'm acting as an interface between the media and the intelligence community.
[01:40:15.543 --> 01:40:20.847]  It is not possible for the intelligence community to do what I'm doing now and go on to a radio show.
[01:40:23.029 --> 01:40:27.493]  Well, you have an impeccable record, and you've been involved in a lot of high-profile cases.
[01:40:27.553 --> 01:40:34.237]  You've testified before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for our Senate here, and you write for major intelligence journals.
[01:40:34.277 --> 01:40:43.044]  You've certainly impressed me, Mr. Shrimpton, because I study this stuff continually, and you're just massively knowledgeable, more knowledgeable in many areas than I am.
[01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:45.806]  I should correct.
[01:40:45.866 --> 01:40:48.308]  I didn't testify before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
[01:40:48.368 --> 01:40:49.869]  The briefing I gave was a closed
[01:40:50.541 --> 01:40:52.562]  Well, I understand.
[01:40:52.942 --> 01:40:55.863]  That's what I meant.
[01:40:55.903 --> 01:40:59.624]  I have, in fact, had the privilege of meeting Senator Graham when he was chairman, just briefly.
[01:41:00.204 --> 01:41:01.544]  Senator Graham may not even recall the meeting.
[01:41:01.584 --> 01:41:04.065]  We met very briefly when I have to be in Congress on another matter.
[01:41:04.885 --> 01:41:05.366]  Very nice, ma'am.
[01:41:05.386 --> 01:41:08.887]  Well, just to be clear, sir, I know when you guys testify, it's always public.
[01:41:09.307 --> 01:41:12.748]  Here, most of what they do, obviously, you know, is behind doors.
[01:41:12.768 --> 01:41:13.208]  That's what I mean.
[01:41:13.228 --> 01:41:13.568]  Exactly.
[01:41:13.628 --> 01:41:16.269]  This was with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
[01:41:16.429 --> 01:41:19.230]  I was invited into their operation.
[01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:20.010]  They're very nice people.
[01:41:20.490 --> 01:41:20.750]  Absolutely.
[01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:23.252]  Now, I was just going over some of your bio for folks.
[01:41:23.312 --> 01:41:27.714]  Now, as we sit here looking at this, for those who don't understand why
[01:41:40.951 --> 01:41:52.037]  Why an element inside England would want to use someone outside England who would then use another membrane between them and the hitmen?
[01:41:52.297 --> 01:41:53.938]  That's just standard operating procedure.
[01:41:54.178 --> 01:41:58.000]  But why would the French be happy to go along with getting rid of Kelly?
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:03.963]  Well, it would depend on the French assessment of whether or not the government would be at risk.
[01:42:04.043 --> 01:42:08.785]  The French would definitely want Tony Blair's government to remain in office.
[01:42:09.443 --> 01:42:14.244]  They would be very concerned, indeed, at any suggestion that might risk the government.
[01:42:14.284 --> 01:42:19.465]  That's a very strong geopolitical motive for the French retaining their ally.
[01:42:19.525 --> 01:42:23.225]  Don't forget that the Blair government is a close ally of President Chirac.
[01:42:23.245 --> 01:42:28.006]  There have been a series of private meetings between Prime Minister Blair and President Chirac since the end of the day.
[01:42:28.046 --> 01:42:32.427]  And they're pushing the Euro, so they believe that if Blair's in danger, the Euro's in danger.
[01:42:32.447 --> 01:42:33.107]  Well, exactly.
[01:42:33.387 --> 01:42:37.788]  Tony Blair is the most high-profile politician in the UK committed to destroying the national currency.
[01:42:38.548 --> 01:42:48.315]  And the French very much want Blair to remain in office for geopolitical reasons, and we've just had a very unusual summit between Blair, Chirac, and the German Chancellor Schroeder.
[01:42:48.696 --> 01:42:49.936]  I have to be very cautious.
[01:42:50.057 --> 01:42:54.720]  I'm not naming Tony Blair as the person who generated the tasking for the assassination.
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:43:01.905]  Indeed, I am quite comfortable that it wasn't Tony Blair who put the tasking into Paris.
[01:43:02.926 --> 01:43:07.229]  Now, question marks, what did he know, and when did he know it, that there are
[01:43:07.867 --> 01:43:09.587]  You know, I can't be so confident.
[01:43:09.807 --> 01:43:11.688]  Well, obviously Tony Blair's a puppet.
[01:43:11.828 --> 01:43:18.949]  I mean, he's not running the entire mechanism of the government, so... Well, he's a puppet Prime Minister anyways.
[01:43:19.209 --> 01:43:20.810]  He's committed to the European Union.
[01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:27.611]  I mean, he takes his orders... Like anyone who says we should be in the European Union, you take your orders from Brussels, because that's what the government from Brussels involves.
[01:43:28.131 --> 01:43:28.791]  Exactly so.
[01:43:28.811 --> 01:43:29.891]  That's the constitutional position.
[01:43:30.592 --> 01:43:32.032]  You know, European Community Law is...
[01:43:33.079 --> 01:43:36.842]  Supreme, according to the European Union, and it takes precedence over British law.
[01:43:37.543 --> 01:43:41.446]  Yeah, your Magna Carta's gone if that sucker asks.
[01:43:42.226 --> 01:43:43.467]  They're tough these days, Alex.
[01:43:44.228 --> 01:43:46.609]  But that's a broader issue.
[01:43:46.810 --> 01:43:49.151]  You're right, incidentally, on the false flagging.
[01:43:51.293 --> 01:44:00.380]  I'm often called upon, formally or informally, usually informally, to deconstruct assassinations, to look at a particular assassination and try and work out what's happened.
[01:44:01.165 --> 01:44:08.710]  Basically, in counter-intelligence work, we would normally recognise eight methods of trying to disguise an assassination.
[01:44:08.730 --> 01:44:13.153]  The first method is you would try and blame it on your political opponents.
[01:44:13.213 --> 01:44:17.496]  That was done in Sweden recently with the assassination of Anna Lindh, the very nice Swedish Foreign Minister.
[01:44:17.996 --> 01:44:22.019]  An attempt was made to blame that on opponents of Sweden joining the Europe.
[01:44:23.005 --> 01:44:24.926]  You can blame it on a terrorist organisation.
[01:44:24.946 --> 01:44:28.888]  That was done particularly with the IRA in the attempted assassination of Margaret Thatcher.
[01:44:28.908 --> 01:44:35.171]  The assassination of the war hero Airey Neve, a Conservative MP, was blamed on the Irish National Liberation Army.
[01:44:35.551 --> 01:44:43.055]  The terrorist organisation might carry out the assassination, but in almost every case, the terrorist organisation is working for a government.
[01:44:44.156 --> 01:44:48.298]  A third method of disguising assassinations, Alex, in my experience, is to false flag them.
[01:44:48.988 --> 01:44:51.210]  Where it's blamed on another agency.
[01:44:51.230 --> 01:45:11.786]  Now there are elements of false flagging in the Kelly assassination, because had the team which carried out the assassination been discovered, clearly it could have been false flagged via Baghdad and, you know, we'd have had three Iraqis in Oxfordshire, assuming it was Iraqis for the sake of argument, and obviously blame would then go to Baghdad and Paris would be off the hook.
[01:45:12.526 --> 01:45:17.110]  The Iranians tried that quite successfully with the attempted assassination of the Pope.
[01:45:17.768 --> 01:45:18.648]  I don't think so.
[01:45:33.894 --> 01:45:45.282]  We've had a lone gunman, a classic example of a lone gunman assassination theory in Europe, with the assassination of the Dutch politician Tim Fortune, which is blamed on a lone gunman.
[01:45:47.163 --> 01:46:02.374]  An explanation which doesn't carry much weight with me, since in the photographs of the assassin that I saw, there was what appeared to me to be a very thin wire leading up to an earpiece in his right ear, and normally Alex lone gunmen don't run around with radios and earpieces.
[01:46:02.984 --> 01:46:03.944]  Particularly high-tech ones.
[01:46:04.044 --> 01:46:06.765]  Well, it was the same thing with Yishak Rabin.
[01:46:07.566 --> 01:46:08.646]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:08.666 --> 01:46:17.489]  I mean, Netanyahu's giving speeches about somebody ought to get rid of this guy, and then Rabin's security steps back and they blow him away.
[01:46:17.769 --> 01:46:28.033]  Well, there are certainly those, certainly respected commentators, who would say that the Rabin assassination was definitely not down to a lone gunman.
[01:46:29.294 --> 01:46:30.094]  Then you've got illness.
[01:46:30.574 --> 01:46:31.575]  Now, this is fairly rare.
[01:46:31.595 --> 01:46:32.795]  It's difficult to fake an illness.
[01:46:33.368 --> 01:46:43.376]  He was down in the case of a British politician, Hugh Gaitskell, who was opposed to Britain joining the European Economic Community, and he came down with a tropical disease in Moscow in the middle of winter, generally speaking.
[01:46:43.396 --> 01:46:51.723]  He was spotted at the time as an assassination, but MI5, although they brought in Porton Down, where David Kelly worked, incidentally,
[01:46:52.627 --> 01:47:11.603]  Port and Dan were brought in, but Port and Dan couldn't work out how the disease which got Hugh Gaitskell, which is lupus disseminata, it's a very nasty disease indeed, it attacks the organs very similar to Ebola, how this tropical disease had found its way to Moscow, they couldn't work out how, what the agent was for getting the lupus into Hugh Gaitskell.
[01:47:11.763 --> 01:47:16.027]  We now know it was probably aerosol, but at the time that technology wasn't known about in England.
[01:47:16.667 --> 01:47:21.331]  Then you've got accident, and there are a couple of interesting political assassinations in Zimbabwe of rape
[01:47:21.883 --> 01:47:26.225]  Road accidents, which I would put a question mark against.
[01:47:26.625 --> 01:47:29.286]  It's less common to try and stage accidents, but it's not unknown.
[01:47:30.306 --> 01:47:36.829]  A friend of mine was nearly taken out in Argentina a few years ago in what looked to me to be a slightly dubious... Well, what about Princess Diana?
[01:47:36.869 --> 01:47:41.871]  She says, Prince Charles is going to kill me in a staged automobile accident and then she dies.
[01:47:42.071 --> 01:47:48.473]  Well, the Diana assassination is certainly probably the classic recent example of trying to make it look like an accident.
[01:47:48.713 --> 01:48:03.659]  We've been having all these microbiologists in government weapons programs walking down the street of the university and a van jumps the rail, chases them, runs them over, then backs back over them, drives back over them, and the police just go, an accident, a hit and run.
[01:48:04.239 --> 01:48:12.483]  Well, if you want the truth on the Anasazi Nation, the best people to talk to are the Israelis, because they had Danny Atom, a lovely guy by the way, who was then head of Mossad in 1997.
[01:48:13.342 --> 01:48:13.762]  We're good to go.
[01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:53.425]  A favourite of intelligence agencies is saxitoxin, which occurs in shellfish, so it's possible, providing you can get some shellfish into the stomach of the victim, a saxitoxin assassination, providing you successfully disguise the puncture wound, or you can find a method of getting the poison into the body.
[01:48:53.445 --> 01:48:57.108]  You know, you can get away with that if you're lucky.
[01:48:57.688 --> 01:49:02.772]  And then the final method is the one tried in the case of David Kelly, that you try and make the murder look like suicide,
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:04.080]  But it's very difficult.
[01:49:04.921 --> 01:49:11.724]  In this case, the attempt to slash the wrist was pointless, because he was already dead, and there's not enough blood.
[01:49:12.885 --> 01:49:17.307]  None of the witnesses, in my judgment, reports enough blood consistent with him bleeding out.
[01:49:17.967 --> 01:49:28.813]  And the medical experts that we've talked to, and that have been insisting on this, the medical experts generally reckon that he would be looking for five pints, that's English pints, of blood.
[01:49:30.569 --> 01:49:41.535]  There's nothing I've seen that persuades me that more than a pint was lost and that's about consistent with what you'd expect from transecting one ulnar artery, completely transecting it.
[01:49:41.655 --> 01:49:48.219]  It then retracts clots and you get surprisingly little bleeding from cutting your ulnar artery.
[01:49:48.679 --> 01:49:52.362]  Well, sir, can we keep you a little bit in the next hour?
[01:49:52.402 --> 01:49:58.487]  Because I want to come back and go to Pat and Jim and Lenny and others that have been patiently holding.
[01:49:58.807 --> 01:49:59.668]  I'd be delighted to talk to you.
[01:49:59.688 --> 01:50:00.248]  I didn't realize.
[01:50:00.308 --> 01:50:00.689]  I'm sorry.
[01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:02.910]  I've been talking on and I've been keeping people on the phone.
[01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:04.892]  I apologize.
[01:50:04.932 --> 01:50:09.936]  This is important information because this shows the type of things that are going on in our world.
[01:50:10.376 --> 01:50:10.476]  Yeah.
[01:50:10.496 --> 01:50:18.558]  And how the media tries to spin this, but why do you think the media have been so willing to go along with the official government story that it's a suicide?
[01:50:19.118 --> 01:50:20.599]  Well, the political consequences.
[01:50:20.879 --> 01:50:33.842]  The mainstream media in the UK are largely committed to UK membership of the European Union, and my guess is that most of the newspapers in the UK would be worried about the political consequences of going public with any story suggesting David Kelly was assassinated.
[01:50:34.737 --> 01:50:36.098]  And then you've got technical competence.
[01:50:36.799 --> 01:50:47.089]  There aren't that many good investigative journalists in the UK, and it's not that difficult to get the mainstream media to buy an official version of events.
[01:50:47.529 --> 01:50:48.170]  Yeah, it's easy.
[01:50:48.210 --> 01:50:50.092]  Just, you know, the Fed says this.
[01:50:50.132 --> 01:50:51.573]  Just write it and go drink a beer.
[01:50:51.733 --> 01:50:52.194]  We'll be back.
[01:50:53.611 --> 01:50:56.513]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[01:50:56.533 --> 01:50:58.515]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[01:50:58.695 --> 01:51:04.338]  Cheaperhotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCar.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.

[01:52:51.936 --> 01:52:59.318]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:52:59.598 --> 01:53:04.339]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:53:04.539 --> 01:53:10.201]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:53:10.441 --> 01:53:14.965]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:53:15.185 --> 01:53:22.351]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:53:22.371 --> 01:53:26.915]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:53:27.056 --> 01:53:29.578]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:53:29.798 --> 01:53:36.524]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:53:36.744 --> 01:53:40.266]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:40.306 --> 01:53:40.606]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:53:40.646 --> 01:53:41.466]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:41.507 --> 01:53:43.307]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:07.449 --> 01:54:12.710]  Okay, folks, we're back live here and we're about to go to your calls.
[01:54:12.730 --> 01:54:14.911]  Everybody's been holding patiently for our guest.
[01:54:15.591 --> 01:54:21.372]  Going back to our guest, Michael Shrimpton, national security lawyer, barrister in England.
[01:54:21.872 --> 01:54:22.192]  Michael?
[01:54:22.933 --> 01:54:24.073]  Yeah?
[01:54:24.153 --> 01:54:28.514]  Continuing with what we were discussing and just briefly recapping, you have a source
[01:54:29.289 --> 01:54:40.721]  Who in intelligence talked to his other sources and it was widely known in intelligence that there was an order to get rid of Kelly even before he died.
[01:54:42.122 --> 01:54:52.272]  My source learnt after the assassination that others in Whitehall were aware of the assassination in advance.
[01:54:52.373 --> 01:54:52.553]  Yes.
[01:54:53.314 --> 01:55:10.585]  And that source had spoken to, obviously he was a friend of David Kelly's, knew him well, had worked with him, and clearly once his friend was found dead in a wood, made investigations, and when he made investigations, he discovered that this assassination was known about in advance.
[01:55:10.825 --> 01:55:22.712]  And he told, and this was in the Associated Press, BBC, you name it, he told an American doctor who was on the team with him in Iraq, he said, if I don't shut up about this, I'm going to end up dead in the woods.
[01:55:23.624 --> 01:55:31.548]  Yeah, there was also an interesting conversation with David Brucher, who was formerly a British ambassador in Prague in the Czech Republic, along similar lines.
[01:55:31.668 --> 01:55:37.530]  And David Brucher, I think, was a witness, in fact, to that inquiry.
[01:55:38.051 --> 01:55:42.132]  David Kelly worked... I never had the privilege of meeting him.
[01:55:42.152 --> 01:55:43.773]  I'd love to have met him.
[01:55:43.993 --> 01:55:45.654]  My friend certainly worked with him and knew him.
[01:55:46.675 --> 01:55:58.681]  David worked very closely with the United States intelligence and worked very closely with Sergeant Mike Pedersen in particular, but I get the impression he was very highly thought of in the U.S.
[01:55:58.701 --> 01:55:59.942]  intelligence community as well.
[01:56:00.542 --> 01:56:10.988]  Was this done by the pro-EU crowd, the globalists I would call them, to put out a chilling effect into everybody in intelligence to keep your mouths shut?
[01:56:12.308 --> 01:56:13.389]  Broadly speaking, yes.
[01:56:16.467 --> 01:56:17.688]  Another question altogether.
[01:56:17.708 --> 01:56:26.077]  It's tolerably clear, one can't be certain, tolerably clear that he was taken out in order to prevent him talking.
[01:56:26.758 --> 01:56:37.962]  Now, what is unclear is whether he was taken out because there was concern he was about to acquire intelligence that might be highly damaging, or taken out because he had acquired it and was about to talk to the media.
[01:56:37.982 --> 01:56:42.063]  We know there was concern about the extent of his media contacts.
[01:56:42.103 --> 01:56:46.865]  He was also a microbiologist, and there's been a whole bunch of those dying around the world.
[01:56:46.905 --> 01:56:48.426]  Let's take a call.
[01:56:49.046 --> 01:56:51.567]  Pat in Indiana, thanks for holding her on the air with our guests.
[01:56:51.607 --> 01:56:51.967]  Go ahead.
[01:56:52.367 --> 01:56:58.151]  Yes, well, this is a little off the subject, but it has to do with... Ma'am, you don't have your radio on, do you?
[01:57:00.873 --> 01:57:04.996]  Yeah, he's... Or a speakerphone or something, because I'm not going to be able to talk to you if you don't turn it on.
[01:57:05.076 --> 01:57:05.937]  Okay, he did.
[01:57:05.957 --> 01:57:06.457]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:57:06.618 --> 01:57:08.759]  Okay, it's on a couple subjects.
[01:57:08.859 --> 01:57:11.021]  I'm going to have to go ahead and put her on hold.
[01:57:11.261 --> 01:57:14.483]  I'm sorry, ma'am, but something's wrong with your phone, or you've got your radio on.
[01:57:16.425 --> 01:57:19.447]  Let's try to bring her back up one more time, and I'm going to have to let her go.
[01:57:19.467 --> 01:57:20.228]  Pat, go ahead.
[01:57:21.141 --> 01:57:22.703]  This is on a couple of subjects.
[01:57:23.063 --> 01:57:25.346]  I don't know what's wrong because we turned our radio off.
[01:57:25.366 --> 01:57:26.046]  Okay, it's alright.
[01:57:26.067 --> 01:57:26.447]  Go ahead.
[01:57:26.927 --> 01:57:29.831]  Okay, this is on a couple of subjects.
[01:57:30.051 --> 01:57:34.556]  One from Earlham College and one from a town hall meeting I had with Mike Pence.
[01:57:35.237 --> 01:57:35.718]  On Friday.
[01:57:35.738 --> 01:57:35.798]  No.
[01:57:52.995 --> 01:57:55.497]  Let's... I know there's a whole bunch of calls here for you.
[01:57:55.537 --> 01:58:06.345]  We'll try to sort them out and find out what's going on as we talk to our guest, Michael Shrimpton, and national intelligence barrister in England.
[01:58:06.425 --> 01:58:09.968]  I bet you see all kinds of just amazing stuff in your job.
[01:58:10.648 --> 01:58:11.209]  I do, yes.
[01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:14.091]  Not all that I can talk about on the air.
[01:58:14.732 --> 01:58:16.233]  And I meet some very interesting people.
[01:58:16.573 --> 01:58:21.797]  And I had a very, very interesting visit to Israel in the middle of last year looking at the new security fence being built.
[01:58:22.450 --> 01:58:26.830]  All right, well, I hear the music, so that means we've got to go ahead and break.
[01:58:27.481 --> 01:58:32.065]  And when we get back and start the third hour, we'll go straight to your calls, folks.
[01:58:32.085 --> 01:58:37.970]  You want to talk to our guest?
[01:58:38.391 --> 01:58:38.771]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:38.931 --> 01:58:40.613]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:41.073 --> 01:58:43.435]  Infowars.com.
[01:58:43.775 --> 01:58:52.363]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:58:52.603 --> 01:59:03.868]  The Berkelyte's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:59:04.089 --> 01:59:06.750]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:59:07.090 --> 01:59:13.533]  The Berkelyte has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:59:13.693 --> 01:59:15.574]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:59:15.774 --> 01:59:21.757]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkelyte convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:59:22.037 --> 01:59:27.721]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:59:28.041 --> 01:59:31.964]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:31.984 --> 01:59:32.685]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:59:32.705 --> 01:59:33.405]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:49.770 --> 01:59:53.971]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:59:54.632 --> 01:59:55.432]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.192 --> 01:59:57.092]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.753 --> 02:00:01.414]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.934 --> 02:00:06.055]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.556 --> 02:00:10.137]  Alright, my friends, down to the third hour.
[02:00:11.315 --> 02:00:19.802]  Talking to Michael Shrimpton, National Security Barrister in England with his intelligence sources concerning the murder of Dr. David Kelly.
[02:00:21.063 --> 02:00:31.030]  And British people are very suspicious, as are many other folks around the world.
[02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:33.392]  And more and more is coming out.
[02:00:33.953 --> 02:00:36.014]  Let's go ahead and go to Jim in Illinois.
[02:00:36.094 --> 02:00:37.095]  Jim, thanks for holding.
[02:00:37.135 --> 02:00:38.256]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:00:38.276 --> 02:00:38.716]  Go ahead.
[02:00:39.777 --> 02:00:40.878]  I have two quick questions.
[02:00:41.694 --> 02:00:45.436]  Mrs. Shrimpton, what is Davis Kelley's wife saying about his murder?
[02:00:47.057 --> 02:00:53.660]  Janice Kelley, hi Jim, Janice Kelley accepts that it was suicide, at least that's her official position.
[02:00:56.121 --> 02:01:05.085]  And my next question, why didn't the British or the American or the Israeli intelligence assassinate Saddam Hussein before the war?
[02:01:06.536 --> 02:01:11.559]  Well, that's a big question, probably better directed to intelligence officials.
[02:01:12.179 --> 02:01:18.562]  Assassination is a very... I mean, I'm opposed to assassinations in principle, one of the reasons why I'm outraged by David Kelly's assassination.
[02:01:19.843 --> 02:01:29.888]  Assassination is a double-edged sword, and I think had we gone in and taken out Saddam Hussein, that would have rebounded on both Britain and America very quickly.
[02:01:29.948 --> 02:01:32.490]  So I think the call not to assassinate him was
[02:01:33.058 --> 02:01:34.099]  That was probably well made.
[02:01:34.119 --> 02:01:39.863]  It's also more difficult to assassinate politicians like Saddam Hussein than first appears.
[02:01:39.883 --> 02:01:45.006]  You remember the CIA's farcical efforts to try and get rid of Fidel Castro.
[02:01:45.807 --> 02:01:51.551]  They had to go for several years and they didn't get anywhere close to assassinating him with exploding cigars and what have you.
[02:01:53.192 --> 02:01:55.594]  I would say the call not to take Saddam Hussein out was right.
[02:01:57.007 --> 02:02:03.450]  The danger with assassinating somebody like Saddam Hussein, you build up inside Iraq popular support for his regime.
[02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:13.254]  Yeah, you turn him into a martyr and also it'll cause a revolution even before you get there and then you won't control kind of the way the balls break.
[02:02:13.555 --> 02:02:14.175]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:14.215 --> 02:02:15.715]  That's a really good question.
[02:02:15.896 --> 02:02:16.696]  Anything else, Jim?
[02:02:17.056 --> 02:02:17.456]  No, thank you.
[02:02:18.036 --> 02:02:18.697]  Great to talk to you, Jim.
[02:02:18.897 --> 02:02:19.737]  I've got a question.
[02:02:19.857 --> 02:02:20.678]  Where is this going?
[02:02:22.418 --> 02:02:24.259]  I've got a question for you, Michael.
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:25.480]  Where is all this going?
[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:33.544]  As more and more doctors and people come forward, and as you come forward and say it's clear that he was murdered, I mean, where does all this go for Tony Blair?
[02:02:34.805 --> 02:02:38.747]  Well, there are indications that he may be preparing to resign.
[02:02:39.287 --> 02:02:44.210]  He's denied officially over the weekend that he's planning to resign, which is an indication that he is.
[02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:46.091]  Never believe anything until it's officially denied.
[02:02:48.072 --> 02:02:49.993]  A number of key advisors have bailed out.
[02:02:50.233 --> 02:02:57.974]  Alastair Campbell, another key advisor, Philip Gould, has just been offered a peerage, which is a form of retirement we have in England that you don't have in the United States.
[02:02:58.014 --> 02:02:59.435]  Michael Meacher, months ago.
[02:02:59.975 --> 02:03:00.815]  Michael Meacher, yes.
[02:03:01.595 --> 02:03:02.635]  There are now calls.
[02:03:02.715 --> 02:03:03.916]  Michael Meacher has issued a call.
[02:03:03.976 --> 02:03:06.176]  He's a former government minister.
[02:03:07.056 --> 02:03:11.037]  Michael has issued a call over the last weekend, calling on him to go.
[02:03:11.057 --> 02:03:15.858]  There are indications that he is on his way out, but it's up to him.
[02:03:17.097 --> 02:03:17.959]  Or after his party.
[02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:19.503]  Well, that would certainly be good.
[02:03:19.543 --> 02:03:21.747]  I mean, have you ever had a Prime Minister this bad?
[02:03:23.368 --> 02:03:25.389]  Well, that's a political question.
[02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:28.630]  The answer is probably, but I can't remember when.
[02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:36.533]  It's a close toss-up between Tony Blair, John Major and Lord North, who lost the American colonies.
[02:03:36.573 --> 02:03:41.035]  But from your point of view, Lord North is probably quite good to have in Downing Street.
[02:03:42.035 --> 02:03:42.816]  That's funny!
[02:03:43.496 --> 02:03:49.158]  Neville Chamberlain, I think that without being disrespectful to my Prime Minister on the air,
[02:03:49.773 --> 02:03:54.014]  I think it's a close call between Tony Blair and Neville Chamberlain.
[02:03:56.835 --> 02:04:11.358]  You could have ten different politicians and economists and military strategists sit around a table and come up with ten different answers as to whether Neville Chamberlain surrendered more of Europe than Tony Blair, and whether Tony Blair surrendered more to France and Germany than Neville Chamberlain did.
[02:04:11.858 --> 02:04:12.538]  It's a close-run thing.
[02:04:12.878 --> 02:04:15.559]  Well, I think it's clearly Tony Blair if he gets what he wants.
[02:04:16.698 --> 02:04:24.644]  Yeah, I have to say, having met Tony Blake, he's quite a pleasant, personable individual.
[02:04:24.664 --> 02:04:26.565]  He's not a monster when you meet him.
[02:04:26.865 --> 02:04:29.087]  Well, they said that about Adolf Hitler, too.
[02:04:29.807 --> 02:04:30.788]  You know, we've got a break.
[02:04:31.028 --> 02:04:43.657]  We'll come right back and we'll go to Lenny Bloom, who's been on this story, and we'll also talk to David in Texas and a few other callers for our guests, and we'll get to Bob and Ron and others and a bunch of other key news items.
[02:04:43.697 --> 02:04:44.137]  Stay with us.
[02:04:45.436 --> 02:04:47.878]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[02:04:48.258 --> 02:04:52.161]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[02:04:52.561 --> 02:04:55.203]  Here at home and abroad, our own war against terror continues.
[02:04:55.484 --> 02:04:56.164]  Important news.
[02:04:56.244 --> 02:04:58.966]  The news you need is sketchy at best when it comes to the mainstream press.

[02:06:48.749 --> 02:06:53.173]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:06:53.314 --> 02:06:57.698]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.

[02:07:45.057 --> 02:07:50.121]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:50.482 --> 02:07:52.824]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:56.947 --> 02:08:12.681]  Just an absolutely amazing and riveting interview of the last hour and eight minutes with our guest, a national security barrister, a lawyer,
[02:08:13.926 --> 02:08:14.286]  I don't
[02:08:28.539 --> 02:08:38.223]  Well, just a lot of interesting facts for us, like usually if you've got some type of terrorist assassination, terrorist killing people, there's usually a government behind them, using them as a go-between.
[02:08:38.703 --> 02:08:49.527]  Oh, we've discovered that here in our research too, and going over the evidence of how Dr. David Kelly was killed, and the elements inside governments that did it, and why.
[02:08:50.467 --> 02:08:51.628]  Let's take a few calls.
[02:08:51.648 --> 02:08:54.971]  We'll go to David and Ian and a few others here in a few minutes.
[02:08:55.511 --> 02:09:01.256]  But right now, let's go to Lenny Bloom, who's been a guest on this show before and has a website, cloakedanddagger.com.
[02:09:01.296 --> 02:09:06.621]  I know last week they got some rumblings of this story and put it out.
[02:09:07.121 --> 02:09:08.703]  And Lenny, what's on your mind?
[02:09:09.143 --> 02:09:10.544]  Well, welcome.
[02:09:10.684 --> 02:09:12.346]  Thanks for having me back, Alex.
[02:09:12.386 --> 02:09:14.908]  You're doing a tremendous yeoman service job.
[02:09:15.703 --> 02:09:26.708]  You know, the pilots who fly these assassination teams around the world don't have a public responsibility to tell the truth, or tell people.
[02:09:27.489 --> 02:09:30.750]  But the media has a core responsibility.
[02:09:30.811 --> 02:09:39.715]  There's so many people involved that I've known and been a part of as a spy pilot over the years.
[02:09:41.058 --> 02:09:44.139]  This thing with Dr. Kelly is something that's interesting.
[02:09:44.339 --> 02:09:57.961]  Ever since the Duke of Edinburgh said he wanted to become a deadly virus and come back and be reincarnated, we have kept the biochemical doctors deathless for good reason.
[02:09:58.461 --> 02:10:01.942]  The Duke doesn't want to be suspected or blamed for his actions.
[02:10:03.382 --> 02:10:06.103]  It's really interesting and clear what's going on here.
[02:10:06.917 --> 02:10:09.218]  Right in front of everybody's nose.
[02:10:09.278 --> 02:10:11.919]  Okay, Lenny, do you have any questions or comments for our guest?
[02:10:12.419 --> 02:10:15.020]  Yeah, I just want to say thanks for coming out.
[02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:19.062]  I think it's great that you're starting to dig into the whole thing.
[02:10:19.342 --> 02:10:22.403]  I think Kelly was number 50 on the death list.
[02:10:24.371 --> 02:10:29.134]  Let me ask our guest that.
[02:10:29.794 --> 02:10:40.021]  Are you familiar, sir, that there's been all over the Western world, Australia, Russia, Western Europe, England, the U.S., top bioweapons scientists being murdered?
[02:10:40.601 --> 02:10:43.483]  And Kelly, just so happen to be one more on that list.
[02:10:44.164 --> 02:10:54.132]  Well, I'm aware of an unusually high percentage of microbiologists going south, and, put it this way, it's attracted my interest.
[02:10:54.772 --> 02:11:01.918]  I think David Kelly wasn't taken out as part of a systematic campaign to take out WMD scientists.
[02:11:01.938 --> 02:11:04.300]  I didn't say that.
[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:05.361]  I agree, I didn't say that.
[02:11:05.421 --> 02:11:09.264]  He's part of a death list though, and there may be different reasons for it.
[02:11:10.004 --> 02:11:11.405]  Hi Lenny, good to hear from you.
[02:11:11.445 --> 02:11:12.586]  You mentioned you're a spy pilot.
[02:11:12.626 --> 02:11:13.327]  What planes do you fly?
[02:11:14.451 --> 02:11:16.012]  Well, I'm rather grounded right now.
[02:11:17.233 --> 02:11:18.114]  What did you use to fly?
[02:11:18.794 --> 02:11:32.384]  I flew everything from F-18s to F-14s to Cessna 172s to Bell 206s and my student became Air Force One helicopter for ten years and he's a three-star general.
[02:11:32.965 --> 02:11:34.686]  I wish I could introduce you to a client of mine.
[02:11:34.726 --> 02:11:36.787]  He once flew an airplane called the Lockheed U-2A.
[02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:40.091]  Over the Soviet Union, with a guy called Gary Powers.
[02:11:40.451 --> 02:11:40.792]  Wow.
[02:11:41.132 --> 02:11:41.352]  Yeah.
[02:11:41.372 --> 02:11:44.654]  Okay, well, thanks for the call, Lenny, I appreciate that, and thanks for all your work.
[02:11:45.294 --> 02:11:46.355]  Great to talk to you, Lenny.
[02:11:46.635 --> 02:11:48.676]  Yeah, let's talk to David in Texas.
[02:11:48.756 --> 02:11:49.596]  David, you're on the air.
[02:11:49.656 --> 02:11:50.097]  Go ahead.
[02:11:50.937 --> 02:11:51.477]  Hello, sir.
[02:11:51.938 --> 02:11:52.638]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:11:53.458 --> 02:11:55.920]  Hi, thank you for taking my call.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.481]  I have a quick question on the media.
[02:11:59.482 --> 02:12:07.166]  I know that you're involved in intelligence, but in our country, we don't see a lot of programming from Tel Aviv and Palestinian television.
[02:12:07.881 --> 02:12:17.585]  And I know they present a very, you know, I don't know, ethical code of the FONTOIS and things of that such.
[02:12:18.186 --> 02:12:20.427]  And we don't quite kill a lot of that, and I'm curious.
[02:12:20.687 --> 02:12:23.188]  Okay, I don't understand exactly what you're saying.
[02:12:23.248 --> 02:12:24.249]  Boil it down for us.
[02:12:25.309 --> 02:12:36.114]  Well, the promotion of, you know, Dying for Allah is a shown thing on TV in Tel Aviv, and the media doesn't really focus on that here in the United States.
[02:12:36.769 --> 02:12:40.831]  I'm wondering what your view is on that, and do you see that in Europe?
[02:12:40.991 --> 02:12:42.452]  I'll go ahead and listen.
[02:12:42.512 --> 02:12:42.772]  Thank you.
[02:12:48.197 --> 02:12:49.157]  I believe he's gone.
[02:12:49.417 --> 02:12:50.037]  Oh, he's gone?
[02:12:50.418 --> 02:12:51.978]  Well, let me answer his question as a courtesy to him.
[02:12:53.138 --> 02:12:55.819]  I'm not very impressed with media coverage of the Middle East generally.
[02:12:55.979 --> 02:13:11.263]  I do subscribe to a very interesting service called Memory, the Middle East Media Research Institute, and some of the stuff they come up with on what is broadcast on mainstream media in Egypt and Saudi Arabia concerning Israel is just shocking.
[02:13:11.323 --> 02:13:13.483]  It's like the 1930s all over again.
[02:13:14.324 --> 02:13:15.924]  Very, very disturbing stuff.
[02:13:17.618 --> 02:13:26.252]  I'm not very impressed with mainstream coverage of the Middle East and that's partly why I went to Israel in June, a little fact-finding tour.
[02:13:26.452 --> 02:13:29.077]  You were there with the IDF on the ground, what did you learn?
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:32.342]  Well, I was very impressed with the way the IDF ran checkpoints.
[02:13:32.503 --> 02:13:35.365]  I talked to the checkpoint commander in Janine, for example.
[02:13:35.405 --> 02:13:36.566]  Very impressed with what I saw.
[02:13:36.666 --> 02:13:43.071]  Very impressed with the security fence, which is clearly having an impact in those sectors of the West Bank, where it's been erected.
[02:13:43.091 --> 02:13:44.673]  Well, I know this.
[02:13:44.733 --> 02:13:47.455]  We sure need one of those on the southern border of the U.S.
[02:13:49.277 --> 02:13:51.060]  And I want one, that thing's beautiful!
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:58.990]  Well, I think your southern border is a bit porous, and as we've seen on 9-11, porous borders can present dangers.
[02:13:59.892 --> 02:14:03.677]  Well I'm not kidding, I've literally seen photos of that thing and I start salivating on it.
[02:14:04.255 --> 02:14:12.241]  Because just the raping and killing and robbery of Mexican troops and killing federal officers, and our news doesn't even report on it.
[02:14:12.341 --> 02:14:15.103]  I mean, it is bedlam on our southern border.
[02:14:15.303 --> 02:14:25.030]  Your southern border is not particularly well protected with respect to the guys and girls who are down there protecting it, but they need more resources.
[02:14:25.110 --> 02:14:26.972]  Back to the IDF, I'm sorry for interrupting.
[02:14:27.432 --> 02:14:29.594]  Well, I'm a big fan of the IDF.
[02:14:29.754 --> 02:14:34.877]  I was very impressed meeting and talking with, you know, from soldiers up to generals.
[02:14:37.299 --> 02:14:38.640]  I think the IDF are doing a good job.
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:44.204]  I think the Israelis know far more about counter-terrorism than we do in Britain or in the United States.
[02:14:44.724 --> 02:14:53.430]  My general line with Israel is I think we in the West, the rest of the West, Israel is part of the West, we need to get off the Israelis' back and let them go and do the job.
[02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:54.991]  They do know what they're doing.
[02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:59.731]  Well, certainly they know how to build a fence, and I wish we had one of those.
[02:15:01.112 --> 02:15:02.753]  The fence is very impressive.
[02:15:02.773 --> 02:15:03.753]  It's more than a fence, of course.
[02:15:04.374 --> 02:15:15.780]  You've got a ditch, you've got a roadway that allows regular patrolling, easy access to any terrorist incursion, good surveillance, some good high-tech stuff there.
[02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:19.742]  The security barriers is a very impressive development.
[02:15:20.202 --> 02:15:21.023]  Yeah.
[02:15:21.063 --> 02:15:22.323]  Let's go ahead now.
[02:15:23.264 --> 02:15:25.065]  Who's up next in line here, Stephanie?
[02:15:26.412 --> 02:15:28.633]  Ian and Canada, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:15:28.673 --> 02:15:29.113]  Go ahead.
[02:15:29.513 --> 02:15:30.133]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:15:30.794 --> 02:15:36.315]  I wanted to ask your guest, I wanted to explore the occultic implications of David Kelly's death.
[02:15:36.875 --> 02:15:43.558]  And by illustration, I'm going to refer to a case that he may be familiar with, Air Marshal Sir Peter Horsley.
[02:15:43.958 --> 02:15:52.681]  They tried to take him out like Diana with rigged brakes on his BMW in the mid-80s, just between Amesbury Circle and Stonehenge, about 660 yards.
[02:15:54.930 --> 02:15:59.296]  Um, if you can believe it, into his drive west along the motorway.
[02:15:59.756 --> 02:16:01.659]  There was that occultic association.
[02:16:02.019 --> 02:16:12.292]  And what I'm wondering is because David Kelly, you reported, probably died on July 17th, which is right in the middle of that high holiday they celebrate at Bohemian Grove, Alex.
[02:16:16.001 --> 02:16:17.001]  Let me bring this up to him.
[02:16:17.021 --> 02:16:24.083]  I don't know if he's aware of it, but Skull and Bones, admittedly a weird occult organization, Bohemian Grove, I snuck into it.
[02:16:24.103 --> 02:16:25.643]  That was on national British television.
[02:16:26.163 --> 02:16:28.584]  The footage I shot a few years ago, it's also aired here.
[02:16:28.604 --> 02:16:34.725]  In some of these killings, they do seem to do it in a ritualistic fashion.
[02:16:35.326 --> 02:16:36.926]  That was brought up with Princess Diana.
[02:16:36.946 --> 02:16:37.906]  Do you want to get into that?
[02:16:37.926 --> 02:16:38.746]  No, I don't see
[02:16:41.167 --> 02:16:43.750]  Uh, he claims that he was being used to take somebody else out, but they rigged his BMW
[02:17:03.877 --> 02:17:05.537]  And I believe he was the target.
[02:17:05.897 --> 02:17:06.938]  But see, here's the problem.
[02:17:06.958 --> 02:17:09.918]  We have all this other stuff in that we can't prove, Ian.
[02:17:10.238 --> 02:17:15.539]  Then when the news goes and listens to this interview, it's, you know, discussions of, you know, things we can't prove.
[02:17:15.579 --> 02:17:16.260]  That's the problem.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:25.021]  Well, Alex, if the guest wants to explore this, the book that Sir Peter wrote is Voices from Another Room, and he'd find it in the UK.
[02:17:25.181 --> 02:17:27.082]  Okay, well, thank you for that.
[02:17:28.095 --> 02:17:33.539]  I'm sure I can find an air marshal who knows when you speed up.
[02:17:34.739 --> 02:17:35.200]  All right.
[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:37.781]  And I guess up next is Wayne.
[02:17:38.021 --> 02:17:39.482]  Wayne, where are you calling us from?
[02:17:40.943 --> 02:17:42.324]  Okay, Wayne is gone.
[02:17:43.785 --> 02:17:46.387]  Let's go ahead and go to Bob in California.
[02:17:46.427 --> 02:17:47.207]  Bob, go ahead.
[02:17:48.568 --> 02:17:49.649]  You're on the air, Bob.
[02:17:50.369 --> 02:17:51.790]  I'm kind of sorry.
[02:17:51.810 --> 02:17:53.592]  I'm not on topic today.
[02:17:54.232 --> 02:17:55.393]  I wanted to call you about
[02:17:56.454 --> 02:18:01.877]  The die-bold machines that our county is using for touch-tone voting.
[02:18:02.258 --> 02:18:02.738]  You know what?
[02:18:02.858 --> 02:18:05.240]  I'm going to put you on hold and we'll get to you coming up in the next segment.
[02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:06.260]  Good morning, Bob.
[02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:10.543]  That's an interesting subject, but not one on which I could give any qualified comment.
[02:18:10.563 --> 02:18:15.026]  Well, we've got so many callers here, it's hard to figure out who's calling in on subject.
[02:18:15.566 --> 02:18:17.307]  It would be nice if they did call in on subject.
[02:18:17.327 --> 02:18:21.930]  Well, you're a popular guy, Alex, and I can understand, having listened to your show, why you've got a lot of feedback.
[02:18:22.350 --> 02:18:23.111]  Oh, well, it's great.
[02:18:23.131 --> 02:18:43.901]  A lot of great people out there, and we've obviously got to have you back on because you're a very intelligent, very informative person, because there's not many people that I get on the show who end up knowing more about intelligence matters, because I study it pretty much perpetually, and you've brought out some very important information, and I really want to thank you for coming on the show, Mr. Shrimpton.
[02:18:44.441 --> 02:18:45.941]  Alex, it's been my pleasure and a privilege.
[02:18:46.301 --> 02:19:04.205]  And for those that just joined us, again, Michael Shrimpton, a national intelligence lawyer or barrister in England, and he writes for major intelligence journals and has consulted around the world on intelligence matters, and he was coming on exposing the murder of Dr. David Kelly.
[02:19:04.625 --> 02:19:07.846]  Do you think those that were responsible will ever be brought to justice, sir?
[02:19:08.662 --> 02:19:10.102]  I don't think they will.
[02:19:10.182 --> 02:19:12.343]  I think those immediately responsible are already dead.
[02:19:13.023 --> 02:19:17.004]  My guess is they were taken out within 24-48 hours of the assassination.
[02:19:18.184 --> 02:19:26.306]  I suspect those involved in tasking the assassination will be dealt with informally and will be given valuable guidance.
[02:19:26.946 --> 02:19:29.367]  And the public will not get to know about it.
[02:19:29.767 --> 02:19:32.888]  And my guess is that the coroner, Nick Gardner,
[02:19:33.388 --> 02:19:33.849]  Thank you.
[02:19:33.869 --> 02:19:34.429]  Thank you.
[02:19:34.509 --> 02:19:34.750]  Thank you.
[02:19:34.770 --> 02:19:35.310]  We'll be back, folks.
[02:19:45.416 --> 02:19:45.856]  Gold.
[02:19:46.197 --> 02:19:47.478]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:19:47.758 --> 02:19:53.823]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:19:54.023 --> 02:19:57.826]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:19:58.206 --> 02:20:00.088]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:20:00.148 --> 02:20:02.430]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:20:02.570 --> 02:20:10.196]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:20:10.196 --> 02:20:10.917]  We're good to go.
[02:20:26.912 --> 02:20:27.633]  We're good.

[02:22:37.955 --> 02:22:39.196]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:22:44.577 --> 02:22:44.977]  Brrr!
[02:22:45.137 --> 02:22:47.218]  Record cold spells gripping the nation this winter.
[02:22:47.298 --> 02:22:48.399]  So much for global warming.
[02:22:48.599 --> 02:22:52.781]  Of course, hand-in-hand with record cold spells, usually go record fuel bills for heating.
[02:22:52.801 --> 02:22:55.762]  But for thousands of people across the country, there's no record fuel bill.
[02:22:55.942 --> 02:22:57.203]  In fact, there's no bill at all.
[02:22:57.363 --> 02:23:03.846]  These people have discovered the magic of a warm workshop without the cost by burning waste oil with a waste oil heater kit from Harold Electric.
[02:23:04.046 --> 02:23:06.668]  We all enjoy having a comfortable shop in the winter months to work in.
[02:23:06.868 --> 02:23:13.631]  And a waste oil heater from Harold Electric can turn your waste oil from a liability into an incredibly efficient and economical way to heat your workshop.
[02:23:13.851 --> 02:23:15.251]  The Waste Oil Heater burns clean.
[02:23:15.451 --> 02:23:18.692]  So clean, in fact, that there's absolutely no visible smoke while it's running.
[02:23:18.813 --> 02:23:19.893]  There's no expensive maintenance.
[02:23:20.013 --> 02:23:22.834]  And the Waste Oil Heaters from Harold Electric are easy to operate.
[02:23:22.994 --> 02:23:28.015]  With heating costs skyrocketing in the past couple of years, adding a Waste Oil Heater in your shop makes perfect sense.
[02:23:28.235 --> 02:23:31.436]  And with a Waste Oil Heater kit you build yourself from Harold Electric, it's easy.

[02:23:46.270 --> 02:23:51.393]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:52.093 --> 02:23:54.475]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:23:55.495 --> 02:23:56.716]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:23:56.796 --> 02:23:58.577]  I've already had two guests up today.
[02:23:59.057 --> 02:24:01.738]  I've been gone for two days last week because I had the flu.
[02:24:02.179 --> 02:24:06.341]  I got a stack of giant news articles, each one of them more important than the last.
[02:24:07.409 --> 02:24:09.410]  I'm going to talk to Bob, Ron, Pat, and John.
[02:24:09.450 --> 02:24:10.390]  That's it for calls.
[02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:16.333]  I'm sorry, because I've got to spend at least 20 minutes here at the end of the show to cover all this news.
[02:24:16.533 --> 02:24:18.533]  I mean, I've just got it coming out of my ears here.
[02:24:19.934 --> 02:24:27.637]  Let's go ahead and go back to Bob, who had some points he wanted to make.
[02:24:27.757 --> 02:24:28.517]  Bob, go ahead.
[02:24:29.238 --> 02:24:30.498]  Yes, Alex.
[02:24:31.158 --> 02:24:32.619]  I simply wanted to say that
[02:24:33.662 --> 02:24:53.839]  The other day on television on the local news channel, we had our registrar of voters tell us that the voting booth things, those diabolical machines that we have in Chesapeake County, she could guarantee that they would be absolutely excellent, they would not have any faults, could not be penetrated by any hackers.
[02:24:54.466 --> 02:24:55.047]  Et cetera.
[02:24:55.187 --> 02:25:06.996]  And she can guarantee that there's going to be no record of it, and you're not going to get any receipt, and no recounts allowed, and they say that here, they say that everywhere, and everywhere where you investigate, they're stealing elections.
[02:25:07.317 --> 02:25:07.697]  Everywhere.
[02:25:07.757 --> 02:25:14.423]  She said that in spite of the fact that there's four other counties surrounding this county suing the state to get these things outlawed.
[02:25:14.863 --> 02:25:23.210]  Also, you're in California, the guy who ran the California election for Diebold was a convicted felon, and guess what he was a convicted felon for?
[02:25:24.074 --> 02:25:24.894]  Computer Hacking!
[02:25:25.054 --> 02:25:27.335]  Computer Hacking and Wire Fraud!
[02:25:28.395 --> 02:25:29.015]  Oh, nice!
[02:25:29.115 --> 02:25:31.516]  Nice Vice President of Diebold!
[02:25:31.536 --> 02:25:35.136]  And by the way, all the Diebold machines got really good returns for Arnold.
[02:25:35.396 --> 02:25:42.618]  He lost on machines that weren't Diebold, but he won on all the others, and he went on Meet the President and said, I'm going to be your new president!
[02:25:42.798 --> 02:25:51.920]  Yeah, I've decided that I'm going to go down to the registrar and get a, what do you call that, a ballot to get the vote off of the machines.
[02:25:53.416 --> 02:25:56.459]  You've got to start a recall petition to get rid of those things.
[02:25:56.579 --> 02:26:05.807]  Well, I'm going to do an absentee ballot right away because I know that if she gets flooded with those kind of absentee ballots, they're going to say, why is no one using these machines?
[02:26:06.348 --> 02:26:11.093]  Maybe they'll take a second look at the money that it's going to cost them, which is the only way to get their attention.
[02:26:11.153 --> 02:26:20.443]  The Voter Assistance Act, uh, above Bush and Chuckie Schumer, that was like $6 billion, that was $5.8 billion, uh, to federalize.
[02:26:20.463 --> 02:26:22.045]  This is all federally paid for!
[02:26:22.145 --> 02:26:23.907]  Why, it's free machines!
[02:26:24.227 --> 02:26:25.669]  The feds love us!
[02:26:28.263 --> 02:26:29.344]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:29.424 --> 02:26:30.265]  Great points, Bob.
[02:26:30.745 --> 02:26:33.248]  Ron in New York, and then Pat, and then John and others.
[02:26:33.948 --> 02:26:34.349]  That's it.
[02:26:34.749 --> 02:26:35.570]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:40.774]  Alex, isn't your guest, Mr. Schroepfer, isn't his life in danger also?
[02:26:40.874 --> 02:26:44.057]  And the other question is, what about Nader?
[02:26:44.097 --> 02:26:45.859]  Has he been brought up?
[02:26:46.279 --> 02:26:49.722]  Well, I wish you had told us you wanted to talk to the guest.
[02:26:49.742 --> 02:26:51.444]  I would have put you on with him.
[02:26:52.364 --> 02:26:53.645]  Yeah, we addressed that.
[02:26:53.945 --> 02:26:55.405]  By going public, he's safe.
[02:26:55.746 --> 02:26:57.726]  And he told me a lot more off air, folks.
[02:26:58.227 --> 02:27:02.048]  They got some really strange laws over there, but he told me a lot more off air, believe me.
[02:27:02.068 --> 02:27:05.230]  But he has intelligence sources in MI5, MI6.
[02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:07.011]  They all know they killed Kelly.
[02:27:07.051 --> 02:27:10.232]  They knew before it even happened that they were going to kill him.
[02:27:10.912 --> 02:27:12.713]  And by going public, he's safe.
[02:27:13.534 --> 02:27:16.555]  And Nader, Ralph Nader, was he brought up to insure Bush's election?
[02:27:17.387 --> 02:27:22.809]  Yeah, this is going to hurt a lot of greenies who are well-meaning people but have got it all wrong.
[02:27:22.929 --> 02:27:26.211]  You don't stop big government with more big government.
[02:27:26.271 --> 02:27:28.392]  You don't stop big corporations with big government.
[02:27:28.632 --> 02:27:30.693]  Big corporations control big government.
[02:27:30.713 --> 02:27:37.476]  You just give them a bigger tool to control you, a bigger hammer to hit you upside the head with, a bigger net to capture you in.
[02:27:37.496 --> 02:27:40.017]  But was he put up to run Sotomayor?
[02:27:40.117 --> 02:27:46.760]  Yeah, Nader puts out a lot of good info, a lot of things he says are true, but his solutions are wrong, and yeah, it's obvious.
[02:27:47.180 --> 02:27:49.082]  And I'm not saying go get Democrats in!
[02:27:49.663 --> 02:28:01.075]  But yes, yes, it is clear the Greens are funded by the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, they're the leftward control arm of the globalists.
[02:28:01.115 --> 02:28:08.523]  Just like a lot of evidence shows some of the other so-called reform groups are the right-wing catch group.
[02:28:10.737 --> 02:28:18.787]  You understand that way for those of us that go off the reservation looking for an alternative, they'll give us a steam valve like Nader.
[02:28:19.548 --> 02:28:22.211]  So he's going to pull votes away from Kerry and Bush will win.
[02:28:22.932 --> 02:28:26.336]  But it won't matter because John Forbes carries skull and bones.
[02:28:27.108 --> 02:28:29.750]  And it doesn't matter because they're put in electronic voting machines.
[02:28:30.030 --> 02:28:33.293]  You have the old model of controlling elections still in place.
[02:28:33.693 --> 02:28:37.917]  As they put in the new model, the touchscreens openly run by the CIA.
[02:28:38.197 --> 02:28:39.658]  Publicly run by the CIA.
[02:28:39.998 --> 02:28:42.180]  So they ensure their win four different ways.
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:43.481]  There's no way they can lose.
[02:28:43.821 --> 02:28:44.582]  Well, exactly.
[02:28:44.682 --> 02:28:48.545]  And in the future, I mean, it's going to be really funny watching them act like there's an election.
[02:28:49.225 --> 02:28:51.787]  Or will these candidates really believe they're in an election?
[02:28:53.450 --> 02:29:06.274]  We're gonna have to have candidates run as like secret agents locally who act like they're globalists and secretly get in and, you know, try to... We'll have to, like, covertly have, you know, I guess our own secret society to get people elected.
[02:29:07.454 --> 02:29:09.234]  That's what they did to overthrow our country.
[02:29:09.415 --> 02:29:11.015]  We're gonna have to have it to defeat them.
[02:29:12.095 --> 02:29:12.956]  Do you get what I'm saying?
[02:29:13.236 --> 02:29:14.176]  Yes, thanks a lot.
[02:29:14.196 --> 02:29:14.976]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:29:14.996 --> 02:29:15.876]  You're doing a great job.
[02:29:15.956 --> 02:29:16.957]  Hey, God bless you, Ron.
[02:29:16.997 --> 02:29:17.657]  Good to hear from you.
[02:29:17.697 --> 02:29:18.477]  It's good to be back.
[02:29:19.417 --> 02:29:21.238]  I never take off two days, folks.
[02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:25.922]  I've always been working, and I guess my body said, no, you're gonna take a rest.
[02:29:27.983 --> 02:29:29.243]  Here's 104 fever.
[02:29:31.124 --> 02:29:32.445]  Here, cough up some blood.
[02:29:32.825 --> 02:29:33.505]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:35.887 --> 02:29:36.807]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.287 --> 02:29:38.908]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.809 --> 02:29:42.510]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:45.819 --> 02:29:50.541]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:29:50.761 --> 02:29:54.202]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:29:54.422 --> 02:29:56.883]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:29:57.123 --> 02:30:05.726]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:30:06.086 --> 02:30:11.848]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:30:12.128 --> 02:30:14.089]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[02:30:14.329 --> 02:30:21.270]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.

[02:30:46.101 --> 02:30:48.483]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:30:48.723 --> 02:30:52.566]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:30:52.886 --> 02:30:53.707]  Read the labels.
[02:30:54.127 --> 02:30:58.270]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:30:58.470 --> 02:31:02.653]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:31:03.033 --> 02:31:07.917]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:31:08.297 --> 02:31:11.879]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:31:12.060 --> 02:31:17.403]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:31:17.683 --> 02:31:20.405]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:49.720]  You heard that right.
[02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:52.260]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:31:52.420 --> 02:31:53.361]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:31:53.621 --> 02:31:54.901]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:31:55.181 --> 02:31:56.761]  Now is the time to fight back.

[02:32:50.512 --> 02:32:56.336]  I'm taking two more calls and we're doing an ultra-massive news blitz.
[02:32:56.356 --> 02:32:59.118]  Let's talk to Pat Indiana, who's really been holding patiently.
[02:32:59.158 --> 02:33:00.199]  Pat, good to hear from you.
[02:33:00.279 --> 02:33:01.740]  Well, that's all right.
[02:33:02.341 --> 02:33:04.182]  I just had two things to say.
[02:33:04.562 --> 02:33:12.849]  I went to a meeting with Mike Pence and I went to Earlham College for a meeting about what's going on in the global situation.
[02:33:13.542 --> 02:33:24.031]  And I asked Mike again about the Patriot Act 1 and 2, and the Victory Act 1 and 2, and I asked him to elaborate on 802, and... This is your Congressman?
[02:33:24.311 --> 02:33:24.912]  Yeah, him.
[02:33:25.793 --> 02:33:33.980]  And he said he helped write the whole Patriot Act, and he couldn't elaborate on 802, and he said there was no Patriot Act No. 2.
[02:33:34.961 --> 02:33:39.785]  Okay, so we got John Ashcroft last year saying there's no Patriot Act 2.
[02:33:40.226 --> 02:33:50.835]  After it's introduced, they've now passed over 60% of it in the Intelligence Act of last year, of December 13th that they passed.
[02:33:51.594 --> 02:33:53.734]  And so you're dealing with a big, fat liar.
[02:33:53.774 --> 02:33:55.215]  There's no Patriot Act II.
[02:33:55.475 --> 02:33:57.035]  That person's a big, fat liar.
[02:33:57.355 --> 02:33:59.755]  And where do I get this information?
[02:33:59.955 --> 02:34:00.776]  Off your website?
[02:34:00.896 --> 02:34:17.378]  Yeah, we have a detailed analysis of Patriot Act I and II on InfoWars.com, and then we have the Associated Press article covering the passage of Patriot Act II in December of last year, and we have Ron Paul's written analysis of it on the site as well.
[02:34:17.738 --> 02:34:19.359]  So I don't know what this guy's talking about.
[02:34:19.759 --> 02:34:20.159]  Okay.
[02:34:21.141 --> 02:34:33.864]  We also went to a meeting over at Earlham College, where it's the Quaker College, and the subject was globalism, and a lot of them have seen your videos, and they're trying to start some grassroots movement around here.
[02:34:34.445 --> 02:34:39.826]  But after I got some literature and came home, I realized on the literature it says, Quaker UN Office.
[02:34:40.552 --> 02:34:43.434]  777-UN-PLUS in New York, New York.
[02:34:43.514 --> 02:34:44.614]  That's what I was about to say.
[02:34:44.934 --> 02:34:55.761]  Look, there's a lot of people involved with the Quakers who are well-meaning, nice folks, aren't evil, but in the 60s it got taken over by the Communists.
[02:34:56.201 --> 02:34:58.262]  I've been to Quaker meetings to protest them.
[02:34:58.782 --> 02:35:00.883]  Open borders, gun control, U.N.
[02:35:00.944 --> 02:35:01.424]  control.
[02:35:01.784 --> 02:35:10.009]  Oh yeah, the Quakers will talk about the New World Order and the big bankers and how it's the evil corporations, but their answer is the U.N.
[02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:12.711]  publicly founded by the corporations!
[02:35:13.191 --> 02:35:19.175]  So again, it's like the phony conservatives are on the air talking about the evil Democrats, but oh, the conservatives are good.
[02:35:20.235 --> 02:35:24.078]  Then the Quakers will talk about the evil Republicans, oh, but the liberals are good.
[02:35:24.478 --> 02:35:26.219]  Either way, the globalists still win.
[02:35:26.707 --> 02:35:28.587]  Yeah, that's exactly what they were saying.
[02:35:28.868 --> 02:35:34.429]  But it's fine to go recruit people out of the Quakers into the real reality.
[02:35:34.989 --> 02:35:35.869]  That's a good thing to do.
[02:35:35.909 --> 02:35:36.569]  Thanks for the call.
[02:35:37.690 --> 02:35:39.630]  It's good to deprogram these people.
[02:35:40.090 --> 02:35:41.610]  And I was about to make fun of the Quakers.
[02:35:41.650 --> 02:35:43.331]  I decided not to do it, then you brought it up.
[02:35:44.271 --> 02:35:45.551]  I mean, I shouldn't make fun of them.
[02:35:45.571 --> 02:35:46.391]  They're very dangerous.
[02:35:46.812 --> 02:35:48.492]  They want open borders.
[02:35:49.676 --> 02:35:50.316]  They're globalists.
[02:35:50.336 --> 02:35:51.397]  They're funded by the bankers.
[02:35:51.457 --> 02:35:57.259]  They find well-meaning people and go, oh, socialism's the answer, see, when the bankers wrote that.
[02:35:57.899 --> 02:35:59.420]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:00.220]  Last caller.
[02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:01.020]  Go ahead, John.
[02:36:02.561 --> 02:36:07.103]  Yesterday on Meet the Press, Ralph Nader announced he's running for president without a party.
[02:36:07.203 --> 02:36:10.244]  The Green Party refused to let him be its candidate or anyone else.
[02:36:10.824 --> 02:36:13.525]  And Nader demanded the immediate impeachment of Bush.
[02:36:14.065 --> 02:36:18.247]  He said Congressman Conyers is sponsoring a bill to impeach Bush before the election.
[02:36:19.283 --> 02:36:21.508]  I have a clip of Nader's demand for impeachment.
[02:36:22.169 --> 02:36:25.356]  It's exactly two minutes long and I have it queued up if you want me to play it on the radio.
[02:36:25.878 --> 02:36:26.780]  Two minutes long?
[02:36:27.749 --> 02:36:31.533]  Two minutes long is the clip of him discussing impeachment with Tim Russert.
[02:36:31.553 --> 02:36:32.514]  Well, the audio's okay.
[02:36:32.554 --> 02:36:36.477]  I might play it, John, but really, I mean, we can get the clips ourselves.
[02:36:36.497 --> 02:36:39.920]  Well, it's on the transcript if you go to Meet the Press from yesterday.
[02:36:39.940 --> 02:36:42.162]  Okay, go ahead and start rolling it if you want to play this.
[02:36:42.222 --> 02:36:43.723]  You can cut it off when you get tired of it.
[02:36:43.763 --> 02:36:43.883]  Okay.
[02:36:43.904 --> 02:36:44.324]  Two minutes.
[02:36:44.764 --> 02:36:45.065]  Okay.
[02:36:45.085 --> 02:36:48.868]  I don't think America belongs just to these Democrat and Republican parties.
[02:36:49.689 --> 02:36:54.373]  In terms of what you stand for, this is what you said in July of last year about George Bush.
[02:36:55.203 --> 02:36:59.746]  Mr. Bush was not only beatable, but impeachable for deception.
[02:36:59.766 --> 02:37:01.187]  That's too bad we can't do it.
[02:37:01.207 --> 02:37:02.508]  John, you've got a horrible hum.
[02:37:02.568 --> 02:37:07.011]  Sounds like we're all about to have our heads explode here.
[02:37:07.071 --> 02:37:07.471]  Sorry.
[02:37:07.931 --> 02:37:13.115]  Send me the video or send me a clip in an mp3 format to tipsandinfowars.com.
[02:37:13.435 --> 02:37:15.556]  We can shoot it up to the network in Minnesota.
[02:37:15.917 --> 02:37:17.518]  We can play stuff like that on air.
[02:37:18.999 --> 02:37:22.341]  We do that quite a bit, but it really sounds bad when it's
[02:37:23.689 --> 02:37:26.091]  When it's like that, I'm sorry, it was horrible.
[02:37:27.312 --> 02:37:31.114]  And I'm not saying Ralph Nader's evil, but his solutions are bad.
[02:37:31.335 --> 02:37:34.177]  Okay, there's corrupt criminal corporations, I agree.
[02:37:35.358 --> 02:37:39.641]  But you don't then get rid of the free market because there's some criminals abusing it.
[02:37:40.141 --> 02:37:50.989]  The criminals are using government to selectively create a crony capitalism where the corporations use the government as their enforcer.
[02:37:51.986 --> 02:37:54.388]  You don't create a bigger government and defeat them.
[02:37:55.188 --> 02:37:59.912]  It's like if somebody's beating you over the head with a club and you go, I'm going to stop them.
[02:37:59.952 --> 02:38:01.953]  I'm going to give them an even bigger club.
[02:38:01.973 --> 02:38:03.774]  That's going to handle this.
[02:38:05.115 --> 02:38:07.037]  And that's what leftists can't figure out.
[02:38:07.597 --> 02:38:10.299]  And then of course the leftists are wrong on the social issues too.
[02:38:12.421 --> 02:38:17.144]  And then the neocons are wrong on almost everything and think they're conservative.
[02:38:18.445 --> 02:38:19.346]  Okay, you know what?
[02:38:19.426 --> 02:38:23.228]  I'm going to cover news now in the last 20-something minutes we've got left here.
[02:38:24.549 --> 02:38:25.529]  There's just so much of this.
[02:38:25.549 --> 02:38:27.890]  I'm going to try to just blast through all of this.
[02:38:28.571 --> 02:38:32.793]  I said I'd read this editorial, so I'll at least read the first page, because it's so good.
[02:38:33.614 --> 02:38:36.936]  But before I do that, I didn't plug my videos last hour.
[02:38:37.576 --> 02:38:39.417]  And, you know, that's how I support this broadcast.
[02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:41.381]  That's how I support my staff.
[02:38:41.601 --> 02:38:43.303]  And they're the best videos out there.
[02:38:43.603 --> 02:38:44.684]  They're waking people up.
[02:38:44.724 --> 02:38:45.425]  They're focused.
[02:38:45.465 --> 02:38:47.286]  They're professionally produced.
[02:38:47.406 --> 02:38:48.387]  I've made ten of them.
[02:38:48.767 --> 02:38:49.648]  I've written a book.
[02:38:50.189 --> 02:38:51.550]  I've published another book.
[02:38:51.630 --> 02:38:54.492]  I carry other videos and books by great researchers.
[02:38:55.733 --> 02:38:59.857]  Folks, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com
[02:39:00.982 --> 02:39:02.043]  Don't procrastinate.

[02:39:05.687 --> 02:39:06.548]  Spread the word.

[02:39:08.950 --> 02:39:10.071]  We're waking people up.
[02:39:10.131 --> 02:39:11.212]  We're freeing minds.
[02:39:11.532 --> 02:39:13.074]  Get 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[02:39:13.354 --> 02:39:14.796]  Find out who really carried out 9-11.
[02:39:15.376 --> 02:39:17.438]  Get Masters of Terror, Part 2 of that film.
[02:39:17.839 --> 02:39:24.025]  Get my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement or Matrix of Evil with Ron Paul and Frank Morales.

[02:39:28.867 --> 02:39:32.668]  I don't have... I'm not going to spend this whole show describing how good these videos are.
[02:39:32.928 --> 02:39:34.889]  You've heard the rave reviews from listeners.

[02:39:51.818 --> 02:40:04.284]  If you don't get a fire in your belly, a fire under your hind end, a desire to want to wake people up, if you don't feel a burning desire to engage the New World Order in the information war, something is wrong with you.

[02:40:49.082 --> 02:40:53.365]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[02:40:53.905 --> 02:40:58.108]  We have videos that wake up 90% of those that see them.
[02:40:58.568 --> 02:41:00.709]  There are access TV stations in your area.
[02:41:01.069 --> 02:41:02.991]  I want you to make copies of my videos.
[02:41:03.831 --> 02:41:05.572]  You don't hear Hollywood folks saying that.
[02:41:05.632 --> 02:41:06.893]  Buy my film and make copies.
[02:41:07.671 --> 02:41:12.433]  No, I want you to get my videos, I want you to make copies, because that's where the power is at.
[02:41:13.594 --> 02:41:17.815]  Thousands of you have gotten the films and taken action and made copies.
[02:41:18.216 --> 02:41:19.316]  It has had a huge effect.
[02:41:19.676 --> 02:41:27.820]  I want thousands more of you to do this, and I want the thousands that have done it, I want to thank you, number one, and I want to ask you to make some more copies!
[02:41:29.804 --> 02:41:36.467]  Because my family, my future, your family, your future, our society, our civilization is on the line.
[02:41:36.787 --> 02:41:39.788]  These bastards must be defeated.
[02:41:41.009 --> 02:41:42.369]  So here's the number one more time.
[02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:42.449]  1-888-253-3139
[02:41:49.091 --> 02:41:58.656]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.

[02:42:12.582 --> 02:42:16.084]  ProGun t-shirts, it's all there, folks.
[02:42:16.264 --> 02:42:18.705]  InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:42:20.359 --> 02:42:22.840]  All right, we got about 18 minutes left.
[02:42:22.860 --> 02:42:24.021]  Let me just blitz through the news.
[02:42:24.121 --> 02:42:27.082]  I said I'd read this editorial because it's so good and it says it all.
[02:42:28.482 --> 02:42:35.445]  Anti-Semitism Charges Causing More Damage Than Film Could by Rabbi Daniel Lappin.
[02:42:36.906 --> 02:42:45.309]  And it says, two weeks before the opening of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, online ticket merchants reported that up to half of their total sales were for the film.
[02:42:46.059 --> 02:42:50.641]  One Dallas Multiplex has reserved all 20 of its screens for The Passion.
[02:42:51.362 --> 02:42:53.423]  I am neither a prophet nor a movie critic.
[02:42:53.563 --> 02:42:55.584]  I am merely an orthodox rabbi.
[02:42:55.604 --> 02:42:57.605]  This is from the Daily News, by the way.
[02:42:59.226 --> 02:43:05.649]  I am merely an orthodox rabbi using ancient Jewish wisdom to make three predictions about the movie.
[02:43:06.990 --> 02:43:11.012]  One, Mel Gibson and Icon Productions will make a great deal of money.
[02:43:11.664 --> 02:43:22.988]  Those distributors who surrendered to pressure from Jewish organizations and passed on the passion will be kicking themselves while New Market Films will laugh all the way to the bank.
[02:43:23.648 --> 02:43:30.170]  Two, The Passion will become famous as the most serious and substantive biblical movie ever made.
[02:43:30.690 --> 02:43:33.691]  It will be one of the most talked about entertainment events in history.
[02:43:34.511 --> 02:43:42.233]  My third prediction is that the faith of millions of Christians will become more fervent as the passion uplifts and inspires them.
[02:43:42.873 --> 02:43:48.274]  The passion will propel vast numbers of unreligious Americans to embrace Christianity.
[02:43:48.915 --> 02:43:53.736]  The movie will one day be seen as a harbinger of America's third great religious reawakening.
[02:43:54.436 --> 02:43:58.537]  Those Jewish organizations that have squandered both time and money
[02:43:59.788 --> 02:44:07.395]  Protesting the Passion, ostensibly, in order to prevent pogroms in Pittsburgh, can hardly be proud of their performance.
[02:44:07.976 --> 02:44:09.697]  They failed at everything they attempted.
[02:44:10.037 --> 02:44:13.000]  They were hoping to ruin Gibson, rather than enrich him.
[02:44:13.941 --> 02:44:16.944]  They were hoping to suppress the Passion, rather than promote it.
[02:44:17.424 --> 02:44:21.888]  Finally, they were hoping to help Jews, rather than harm them.
[02:44:23.450 --> 02:44:35.014]  But by selectively unleashing their fury only on wholesale entertainment that depicts Christianity in a positive light, these groups have triggered anger, hurt, and resentment.
[02:44:35.714 --> 02:44:41.816]  Hosting a radio show and speaking before many audiences nationwide, I enjoy extensive communication with Christian America.
[02:44:42.377 --> 02:44:43.537]  And what I hear is troubling.
[02:44:44.286 --> 02:45:00.042]  Fearful and attracting the ire of Jewish groups that are so quick to hurl the anti-Semite epithet, some Christians are reluctant to speak out, although one can bludgeon resentful people into silence behind closed doors, emotions continue to simmer.
[02:45:00.916 --> 02:45:08.040]  I consider it crucially important for Christians to know that not all Jews are in agreement with their self-appointed spokesman.
[02:45:08.380 --> 02:45:25.030]  Most American Jews experience warm and gracious interactions each day with their Christian fellow citizens and would feel awkward trying to explain why so many Jewish organizations seem focused on an agenda hostile to Judeo-Christian values.
[02:45:25.250 --> 02:45:27.391]  And it goes on and on and I couldn't say it any better.
[02:45:28.248 --> 02:45:29.489]  And that's what I said last week.
[02:45:29.649 --> 02:45:33.971]  I said no one would have seen this movie and thought, man, Jews are bad.
[02:45:34.911 --> 02:45:40.634]  I mean, I grew up, folks, watching movies about Jesus, reading the Bible, and never thought, oh, Jews are bad.
[02:45:41.914 --> 02:45:48.197]  I mean, this was the corrupt government of the Jews and the Romans killing somebody who was speaking out against their evil.
[02:45:48.677 --> 02:45:49.978]  We know governments are evil.
[02:45:51.358 --> 02:45:52.599]  We know man's evil.
[02:45:53.559 --> 02:45:57.001]  So by the ADL running out and doing this and saying this,
[02:45:58.516 --> 02:46:01.979]  All they've done is made people think, hmm, what's going on?
[02:46:02.139 --> 02:46:03.640]  And the rabbi goes on to say that.
[02:46:05.402 --> 02:46:10.225]  And, uh, that's what I said last week.
[02:46:10.566 --> 02:46:14.689]  And, uh, you know, look, I have Jewish friends, and, uh,
[02:46:15.535 --> 02:46:16.636]  They're upset about this.
[02:46:16.836 --> 02:46:18.617]  I mean, they can't stand the ADL.
[02:46:19.038 --> 02:46:21.920]  The ADL will go after a Jewish group of their pro-gun, folks.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:31.167]  I mean, it's just... It's time for Americans to stand up to the ADL, as well as the Southern Poverty Law Center, but they're not as powerful as the ADL, and to tell them to stop it.
[02:46:31.808 --> 02:46:38.833]  Because they've totally discredited Jews when they try to stand up against something that is anti-Semitic.
[02:46:39.374 --> 02:46:42.416]  Because there is a place for standing up against anti-Semitism.
[02:46:42.856 --> 02:46:44.678]  There needs to be organizations that do that.
[02:46:45.245 --> 02:46:51.148]  I mean, I stand up against racist Mexicans and blacks and white supremacists, but I don't have to be Jewish to do it!
[02:46:51.808 --> 02:46:59.052]  And so, we need to understand here that this rabbi is correct, and it's time to stop letting the ADL be the spokesman for Jews.
[02:47:00.033 --> 02:47:01.193]  It's real simple.
[02:47:02.734 --> 02:47:13.620]  And on Hutton Gibson, good friend of mine, good people, I've talked to him many times off-air, he loves the Jewish people, he does not dislike Jews, everything you hear is taken out of context,
[02:47:14.447 --> 02:47:16.410]  He does not think 6 million Jews died.
[02:47:17.811 --> 02:47:18.993]  Those numbers aren't clear.
[02:47:19.053 --> 02:47:19.854]  Hutton studied it.
[02:47:20.254 --> 02:47:21.936]  He hates Hitler.
[02:47:22.216 --> 02:47:24.219]  He criticizes the Pope, folks.
[02:47:24.499 --> 02:47:25.660]  Holds the Pope names.
[02:47:26.381 --> 02:47:27.883]  He is against Zionism.
[02:47:28.804 --> 02:47:30.246]  And he is not anti-Semitic.
[02:47:30.766 --> 02:47:34.751]  And he believes Masons are the ones that are now in control of Judaism.
[02:47:35.747 --> 02:47:38.889]  Uh, and uh, and they seem to be in control of everything for that matter.
[02:47:39.229 --> 02:47:45.732]  And so they take that out of context and try to make him look like he's anti-semitic again, and it's just gonna backfire.
[02:47:46.252 --> 02:47:57.178]  And I got a call from MSNBC, a call from CNN, and I just told my wife when she said they were on the phone, I just said, look, we're not doing the interviews because I'm not gonna sit here and add fuel to this fire.
[02:47:58.633 --> 02:48:02.795]  So, and you know, I got Hutton's number as he travels around the country visiting family.
[02:48:02.815 --> 02:48:06.837]  I don't think I'm going to call him and tell him, oh, Hutton, I didn't go on national TV and talk about you.
[02:48:06.857 --> 02:48:12.280]  But perhaps Pastor Bush can tell him that, that I told MSNBC and others that I didn't want to talk to him.
[02:48:13.561 --> 02:48:15.062]  But it's just horrible.
[02:48:15.102 --> 02:48:18.183]  They've taken something wholesome like the Passion and tried to make it dirty.
[02:48:18.984 --> 02:48:22.926]  And, you know, even if Hutton Gibson, you know, was bad, which he's not, he's a good guy.
[02:48:23.718 --> 02:48:29.520]  Still, by going and focusing on him, they try to make it something nasty and bad, and it causes division.
[02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:31.160]  And I've said it over and over again.
[02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:33.581]  Multiculturalism does that.
[02:48:33.681 --> 02:48:35.522]  It actually creates racism.
[02:48:36.802 --> 02:48:37.642]  You can prove that.
[02:48:38.102 --> 02:48:39.983]  Okay, prepare yourself for a news blitz.
[02:48:40.363 --> 02:48:44.204]  Here, I spent too much time on this, but the Rabbi's words needed to be heard.
[02:48:44.224 --> 02:48:45.185]  I agree with him.
[02:48:47.023 --> 02:48:49.604]  House votes for ignition interlocks on every vehicle.
[02:48:50.144 --> 02:48:52.305]  This is out of the Associated Press, Santa Fe, New Mexico.
[02:48:52.365 --> 02:48:53.545]  I told you this five years ago.
[02:48:54.106 --> 02:48:57.907]  You're all going to blow in the breathalyzer to start your cars.
[02:48:58.007 --> 02:49:02.308]  And then it's going to be a retina scanner because, oh, you can have your kids or your wife blow for you.
[02:49:02.709 --> 02:49:03.549]  This is the federal plan.
[02:49:04.855 --> 02:49:10.078]  The House has approved a measure that would require ignition interlocks on every vehicle sold in New Mexico.
[02:49:10.098 --> 02:49:15.181]  It would require the devices on new vehicles by 2008, and on used vehicles on sale by 2009.
[02:49:15.602 --> 02:49:19.444]  And everyone will have to blow to start their car.
[02:49:22.211 --> 02:49:24.512]  I mean, Big Brother on steroids?
[02:49:25.132 --> 02:49:25.512]  Come on.
[02:49:26.153 --> 02:49:30.735]  Good news, Carcieri pulls bill on Homeland Security.
[02:49:31.455 --> 02:49:35.997]  This is out of the Providence Journal on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:49:37.537 --> 02:49:47.881]  Do you remember the last Wednesday we read the Governor's bill where it said, criticize the government, you're arrested as a terrorist, fly anything but the American flag, you're arrested as a terrorist?
[02:49:50.074 --> 02:49:51.475]  Total government secrecy.
[02:49:51.936 --> 02:49:53.197]  We're all terrorists now.
[02:49:54.097 --> 02:49:56.079]  The World War I laws.
[02:49:57.180 --> 02:49:58.521]  You talk about Nazi Germany.
[02:49:58.761 --> 02:50:00.983]  Well, the governor says, I never read the bill.
[02:50:01.083 --> 02:50:01.823]  I didn't know it.
[02:50:01.983 --> 02:50:02.844]  I'm sorry.
[02:50:02.864 --> 02:50:05.486]  I apologize.
[02:50:05.606 --> 02:50:07.408]  But I am going to try to pass another bill.
[02:50:08.328 --> 02:50:13.012]  And by the way, he went to the governor's conference with Governor Ridge and got this legislation.
[02:50:15.154 --> 02:50:16.855]  So that shows you what Ridge is up to.
[02:50:17.455 --> 02:50:18.937]  And it says a bunch of states have passed it.
[02:50:20.363 --> 02:50:21.223]  Good news, though.
[02:50:21.243 --> 02:50:25.624]  We got the word, and we got radio stations up in that neck of the woods.
[02:50:25.644 --> 02:50:27.444]  1320 and other great folks.
[02:50:28.205 --> 02:50:31.685]  And so we got it stopped, thanks to you, so good job.
[02:50:33.146 --> 02:50:34.926]  But, boy, you talk about nightmare stuff.
[02:50:35.086 --> 02:50:36.366]  Arnold wants to be your president.
[02:50:36.386 --> 02:50:39.047]  We'll talk about a real live Nazi that the ADL loves.
[02:50:40.167 --> 02:50:42.407]  Hadn't found a Nazi they don't love, boy, I tell ya.
[02:50:42.628 --> 02:50:44.428]  We'll talk about this monster when we get back.
[02:50:46.707 --> 02:50:59.397]  Most so-called tax shelters try to show you how to reduce your taxes, but they still insist that you must pay taxes, and they require that you do goofy, bizarre things with your money that you'd never normally do just so you can save a few bucks.
[02:51:00.058 --> 02:51:01.179]  Not this tax shelter!
[02:51:01.619 --> 02:51:10.126]  It's so complete, it's so superior, that it will teach you how to properly comply with the tax laws, and still end up with zero tax liability.
[02:51:10.406 --> 02:51:10.887]  Imagine!
[02:51:11.187 --> 02:51:14.430]  You find out that you've been deceived about what the tax laws require,
[02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:17.931]  And you learn how to obey them better than you ever have before.
[02:51:18.111 --> 02:51:20.631]  And as a result, you end up owing the government nothing.
[02:51:21.052 --> 02:51:24.392]  You get to keep every single dime of your hard-earned money.
[02:51:24.792 --> 02:51:25.473]  Sound amazing?
[02:51:25.893 --> 02:51:26.993]  Sound too good to be true?
[02:51:27.533 --> 02:51:28.533]  Find out for yourself.
[02:51:29.033 --> 02:51:31.254]  Go to besttaxshelter.com.

[02:51:46.690 --> 02:51:51.192]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:51:51.532 --> 02:51:55.634]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:51:55.915 --> 02:51:56.475]  We listened.
[02:51:56.775 --> 02:52:01.758]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:52:02.038 --> 02:52:02.518]  We listened.
[02:52:02.898 --> 02:52:05.940]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:52:06.380 --> 02:52:06.900]  We listened.
[02:52:07.380 --> 02:52:10.742]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:52:10.762 --> 02:52:11.322]  We're good to go.

[02:52:41.744 --> 02:52:43.165]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:52:45.087 --> 02:52:49.410]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:52:49.610 --> 02:52:54.054]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:52:54.194 --> 02:52:55.415]  There is a chance.
[02:52:55.953 --> 02:52:58.554]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[02:52:58.654 --> 02:53:01.396]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:53:01.716 --> 02:53:05.938]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:53:06.018 --> 02:53:12.941]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:53:13.061 --> 02:53:15.062]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:53:15.302 --> 02:53:25.786]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:53:26.066 --> 02:53:31.448]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:53:35.729 --> 02:53:37.009]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:53:45.998 --> 02:53:49.902]  Alright, continuing with more of the news.
[02:53:50.662 --> 02:53:54.886]  New York Times reports, court upholds judge's right to compel medication.
[02:53:55.846 --> 02:54:08.417]  The state's highest court on Tuesday upheld the constitutionality of law that gives judges authority to force mentally ill people to comply with treatment, but we've actually read the legislation and what the court ruled on.
[02:54:09.591 --> 02:54:10.331]  That's not the case.
[02:54:10.391 --> 02:54:11.972]  It's the Charles T. Sell case.
[02:54:12.012 --> 02:54:14.413]  He hasn't even been found to be mentally ill.
[02:54:14.573 --> 02:54:16.654]  The judge is drugging for trial.
[02:54:18.015 --> 02:54:20.756]  Also, years of FBI agent crimes detailed.
[02:54:20.776 --> 02:54:23.397]  This is from CBS News, and this is the tip of the iceberg.
[02:54:23.997 --> 02:54:38.824]  An internal FBI report kept under wraps for three years entails dozens of cases of agents fired for egregious misconduct and crimes including drug trafficking, attempted murder, theft, misuse of informants, consorting with prostitutes.
[02:54:39.725 --> 02:54:54.837]  Report Wednesday by Senator Charles Grassley, Republican Iowa, found that about 1,000 agents were dismissed in all for serious misconduct or criminal offenses by the FBI during the period examined from 1986 to 1999.
[02:54:55.398 --> 02:54:58.640]  The average was between 8 and 9 per year.
[02:55:01.543 --> 02:55:06.507]  How do you have 1,000 agents were dismissed for serious misconduct
[02:55:07.316 --> 02:55:10.400]  And over 16 years, it's only 90 years.
[02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:11.902]  Boy, do the math there.
[02:55:12.322 --> 02:55:13.564]  That's a misprint.
[02:55:16.127 --> 02:55:21.674]  Although the numbers were small, the FBI's attempts to cover it up were a concern.
[02:55:22.435 --> 02:55:22.915]  Folks!
[02:55:24.665 --> 02:55:26.926]  You've got compartmentalized FBI agents.
[02:55:26.966 --> 02:55:30.247]  In fact, most of the guys that get kicked out were the good guys who blew the whistle.
[02:55:30.527 --> 02:55:31.748]  And I have specific cases.
[02:55:32.168 --> 02:55:34.929]  The big fat cats are getting paid off by the Mafia.
[02:55:35.289 --> 02:55:37.710]  And in many cases, they act as the Mafia.
[02:55:37.890 --> 02:55:39.751]  And that's all come out in the Boston Globe.
[02:55:40.011 --> 02:55:41.912]  So don't try to spin it, CBS.
[02:55:42.792 --> 02:55:44.173]  I mean, it is scary, folks.
[02:55:44.233 --> 02:55:46.734]  Murder for hire, drug dealing, you name it.
[02:55:47.234 --> 02:55:48.495]  Hits for the Mafia.
[02:55:49.115 --> 02:55:50.275]  Very scary people.
[02:55:52.056 --> 02:55:54.337]  This is out of the Sunday Telegraph.
[02:55:55.123 --> 02:55:56.584]  Bin Laden surrounded!
[02:55:57.224 --> 02:56:01.306]  The British Sunday newspaper is claiming that Osama Bin Laden has been found and is surrounded by U.S.
[02:56:01.326 --> 02:56:05.589]  Special Forces in an area of land bordering North Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:10.612]  He told you two years ago he died of kidney failure, will be handed over right before the election.
[02:56:11.012 --> 02:56:13.213]  Now Albright says it, now everybody says it.
[02:56:14.802 --> 02:56:15.102]  U.S.
[02:56:15.142 --> 02:56:16.943]  search for Bin Laden intensifies.
[02:56:16.983 --> 02:56:18.163]  This is the Washington Times.
[02:56:18.183 --> 02:56:25.766]  The Pentagon is moving elements of a super-secret commando unit from Iraq to Afghanistan theater to set up the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.
[02:56:25.866 --> 02:56:28.648]  So now they're telling you about how they're about to stage it.
[02:56:30.168 --> 02:56:31.169]  So that's a real joke.
[02:56:31.569 --> 02:56:34.450]  Schwarzenegger argues for White House run.
[02:56:35.536 --> 02:56:41.560]  And, uh, he said that, uh, there are so many people in this country that are now from overseas!
[02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:42.781]  They are immigrants!
[02:56:42.821 --> 02:56:45.683]  They are doing such terrific jobs with their work!
[02:56:46.023 --> 02:56:47.384]  Bringing businesses here!
[02:56:47.804 --> 02:56:49.966]  There is no reason why not!
[02:56:50.546 --> 02:56:52.648]  Why not I become President?
[02:56:53.568 --> 02:56:55.710]  Because you're a racist scumbag!
[02:56:56.070 --> 02:56:57.431]  Because you're a fat pig!
[02:56:58.132 --> 02:57:03.474]  And more importantly, because you're a foreign agent of a foreign power called the New World Order.
[02:57:03.894 --> 02:57:05.855]  You're a little minion of George Shultz.
[02:57:06.635 --> 02:57:08.195]  And we passed that law.
[02:57:09.216 --> 02:57:09.876]  That amendment.
[02:57:10.656 --> 02:57:12.457]  And we have that in our Constitution.
[02:57:12.777 --> 02:57:22.020]  Because right at the founding of America, the Austrians got their people in and overthrew the government of Poland.
[02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:24.681]  Using foreigners, they got elected.
[02:57:25.416 --> 02:57:28.017]  From Austria, you piece of filth!
[02:57:29.057 --> 02:57:32.678]  You gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, socialist, Bush supporter!
[02:57:33.958 --> 02:57:39.580]  So, he goes on to say, look at the kind of contribution people like Henry Kissinger have made!
[02:57:39.880 --> 02:57:45.622]  Madeleine Albright, he said, referring to two former Secretaries of State who were born in Europe!
[02:57:47.582 --> 02:57:48.322]  It's sick!
[02:57:50.743 --> 02:57:54.484]  An abortion-promoting, gun-grabbing, open-border-loving,
[02:57:55.282 --> 02:57:55.822]  Nazi.
[02:57:57.523 --> 02:58:00.824]  Hey, if you love all that, you get ADL approved.
[02:58:02.665 --> 02:58:05.466]  Oh man, it's just rebels control more than Haiti.
[02:58:05.486 --> 02:58:06.947]  They're getting ready to send U.S.
[02:58:06.987 --> 02:58:07.247]  troops.
[02:58:07.267 --> 02:58:07.847]  Well, actually, U.S.
[02:58:07.867 --> 02:58:11.569]  troops are already there, but larger contingencies are on the ground.
[02:58:12.109 --> 02:58:13.329]  That'll be a nice diversion.
[02:58:13.689 --> 02:58:16.351]  More aliens try to enter after Amnesty.
[02:58:16.411 --> 02:58:19.332]  Washington Times admitting it's a record invasion.
[02:58:19.852 --> 02:58:23.233]  DARPA, they admit, is now back with the Total Information Awareness Network.
[02:58:23.553 --> 02:58:24.754]  Folks, it was never gone.
[02:58:25.638 --> 02:58:27.039]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:58:27.079 --> 02:58:28.240]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:29.701]  Be sure and join us.
[02:58:29.721 --> 02:58:30.702]  There's a lot more.
[02:58:30.802 --> 02:58:31.563]  I didn't get to.
[02:58:31.583 --> 02:58:32.584]  Go to the websites.
[02:58:33.124 --> 02:58:35.146]  Just get out there and fight the New World War!
[02:58:35.266 --> 02:58:35.726]  Please!
