[00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:06.349]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.069]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:09.890]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.370]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.030]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:17.312]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:21.953]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.062]  Hello my friends, here we are on this live first day edition.
[00:00:41.143 --> 00:00:52.548]  21st of October 2004, what now we're ten days, ten and a half days away from the 2004 election.
[00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:56.690]  What are your predictions?
[00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.851]  Who do you think is going to win the presidency?
[00:00:58.931 --> 00:00:59.811]  Does it matter?
[00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.133]  What's the real difference between the two different candidates?
[00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:18.260]  We do have Michael Perutka, the presidential candidate for the Constitution Party, joining us tomorrow.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:30.628]  And in the third hour today, we're going to talk about Internet 2 and regulation and control and how they're trying to censor and how Colin Powell wants to come in and start regulating
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.901]  Those free phone calls you can make over your computer.
[00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.942]  That's coming up in the third hour.
[00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:41.425]  Also, we got a guest coming up concerning Las Vegas.
[00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:50.909]  They're going to do home inspections of your house just to make sure you're following zoning codes and everything's safe and hunky-dory.
[00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:56.472]  The problem is, is that they don't send you a notice and tell you the date it's going to happen.
[00:01:56.492 --> 00:01:57.272]  That's bad enough.
[00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:03.510]  Even in feudal England, 500 years ago they couldn't do this, but here they can.
[00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.911]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:02:05.672 --> 00:02:12.918]  But, they are going to come in your house without even telling you that they were coming.
[00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:16.641]  And they can just show up anytime they want with the police and do it.
[00:02:19.403 --> 00:02:22.586]  And see, none of this has anything to do with terrorism, it's just for zoning.
[00:02:23.147 --> 00:02:26.870]  And then this morning I tried to do an internet search on it and couldn't find it.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.483]  The town had Ville in the name, I believe.
[00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:34.306]  It's a big city in Illinois.
[00:02:35.887 --> 00:02:42.594]  And there were several articles in the Chicago Tribune and several other papers about two and a half years ago.
[00:02:44.256 --> 00:02:52.504]  And it described how government housing, private housing, nice homes, small homes, everybody gets visits
[00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:57.999]  and uh... you know describe an old lady standing there at six thirty a.m.
[00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:20.512]  making coffee and she turns around in her nightgown, her underwear and there's uh... cops with guns searching her house and they walk in and find two toothbrushes and so they find her saying well city zoning says only one person can live here and she says well I do live alone, my husband's dead and uh...
[00:03:22.324 --> 00:03:25.305]  They say to her, well, we don't care.
[00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:27.205]  We're fining you several hundred dollars.
[00:03:28.085 --> 00:03:30.386]  We go off the indicator of two toothbrushes.
[00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:36.867]  By the way, that sounds so crazy that I wasn't even going to mention it because I couldn't find the old article.
[00:03:36.887 --> 00:03:39.127]  But I've read that article over and over again on air.
[00:03:39.888 --> 00:03:41.268]  Just one of the many articles about it.
[00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:43.648]  I know we've got listeners in Illinois.
[00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:46.929]  Can you call and tell me the name of the town?
[00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.169]  Is it Queensville?
[00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.290]  Or... Someone say Pleasantville?
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.561]  Other areas around the country have it.
[00:03:57.183 --> 00:04:03.027]  You know, it's like when I make the claim that local news here in Austin says that mercury is a nutritious part of your daily breakfast.
[00:04:03.087 --> 00:04:03.987]  It's good for your brain.
[00:04:05.028 --> 00:04:06.409]  We actually have that clip.
[00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.931]  I feel insane saying it.
[00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:10.271]  Watching it, I felt insane.
[00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.712]  I felt like I was hallucinating.
[00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:14.234]  But it's really happening, folks.
[00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:16.956]  All this craziness is really going on.
[00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:19.418]  They really are preparing to attack Iran.
[00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:25.547]  We really do have two guys that are cousins, members of the same cult, running for president.
[00:04:25.607 --> 00:04:28.650]  I mean, I really did sneak into Bohemian Grove.
[00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.191]  They really do put on red and black hoods and worship the devil.
[00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.694]  I mean, we're in a world of hurt!
[00:04:37.056 --> 00:04:39.858]  But the good news is, at least we're aware of it, we're out here fighting it.
[00:04:39.898 --> 00:04:42.760]  So I do have the news about Las Vegas doing this.
[00:04:45.102 --> 00:04:48.264]  But can somebody call in who knows the Illinois town I'm talking about?
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.780]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.281]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:02.743]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.923 --> 00:05:06.006]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.126 --> 00:05:10.030]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:14.315]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.655 --> 00:05:18.439]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.381]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.982 --> 00:05:23.883]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:28.626]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:31.827]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:34.849]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:41.472]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.012 --> 00:05:45.796]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.196 --> 00:05:47.558]  Order your video today.

[00:06:00.586 --> 00:06:01.326]  Terrorism.
[00:06:01.507 --> 00:06:02.267]  Terrorism.
[00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:03.207]  Chemical attacks.
[00:06:03.267 --> 00:06:03.948]  Dirty bombs.
[00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:04.448]  Fallout.
[00:06:04.528 --> 00:06:05.529]  Biological attack.
[00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:06.249]  Anthrax.
[00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:08.410]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.271]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:06:10.511 --> 00:06:12.992]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.392 --> 00:06:27.960]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.300]  government.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.301]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:36.563]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:36.703 --> 00:06:41.225]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:08:00.984 --> 00:08:06.028]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.388 --> 00:08:08.730]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.433 --> 00:08:12.754]  There certainly is
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.382]  In the last segment, I kind of got sidetracked.
[00:08:20.182 --> 00:08:27.866]  Going over some of the news we'll be covering today because I was so busy looking at this Associated Press article.
[00:08:27.886 --> 00:08:30.827]  I also have one from KLAS-TV.
[00:08:30.847 --> 00:08:37.770]  And it says, North Las Vegas proposes rental enforcement plans.
[00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.611]  See, it's much worse than this
[00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:42.487]  City in Illinois that I can't remember the name of.
[00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:50.873]  It says that if you rent a home or apartment in North Las Vegas, city officials may come to inspect it to see what's up to code.
[00:08:50.954 --> 00:08:55.157]  The problem is they don't have to let you know when they plan to do the inspection.
[00:08:55.217 --> 00:08:59.961]  It's called PREP, or the Protective Rental Enforcement Plan.
[00:08:59.981 --> 00:09:06.566]  City officials say it would eliminate or significantly reduce substandard housing, but others say the proposed
[00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:10.159]  System violates the Constitution.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.040]  Alan Bassett and his family purchased the Mountain View Apartments three years ago.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.681]  We've revamped the landscaping, put in a parking lot, repainted the exterior of apartments.
[00:09:19.721 --> 00:09:32.584]  Soon Bassett and other rental property owners in North Las Vegas may be forced to open their doors to city inspectors, who North Las Vegas City Manager Gregory Rose says will be looking for health and safety code violations.
[00:09:33.484 --> 00:09:43.849]  But we, and he continues, what we will be looking for is things such as insect infestation, hazardous situations, such as freight wiring, Rose explained.
[00:09:46.091 --> 00:09:51.373]  And Alan Lichtenstein says this is truly Big Brother.
[00:09:51.634 --> 00:10:01.699]  Lichtenstein with the ACLU says the proposal is an invasion of privacy because the city will only notify landlords when inspections will take place and if renters
[00:10:02.618 --> 00:10:06.159]  Turn inspectors away, they will apply for a warrant.
[00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:13.541]  This proposal puts no limits on what inspectors can look for, and it says that anything they find, they can give to the police, Lichtenstein said.
[00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:22.084]  Landlords will pay $50 per unit to cover inspection costs, and with 32 units, that equals $1,600 a year, Bassett said.
[00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:25.445]  With an older building, there's always going to be something to fix, he said.
[00:10:26.305 --> 00:10:26.785]  And it's being
[00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:32.449]  Forced to fix things that do not violate code that Bassett says he's worried about.
[00:10:33.429 --> 00:10:37.151]  Alright, I'm going to stop babbling through this article and just point something out.
[00:10:38.892 --> 00:10:50.798]  In Illinois, and other cities, other states with different cities around the country, that I've read about in the past, it's just what this news article says.
[00:10:51.477 --> 00:10:59.943]  They admittedly are there digging through your stuff right in front of you, looking for something illegal, looking for something to call the police on you.
[00:11:01.143 --> 00:11:08.808]  But then in this particular town, again in Illinois, and I can't remember the name, I covered this a couple years ago, it was called Somethingville.
[00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:13.511]  Please call in if you live in the bill.
[00:11:14.612 --> 00:11:17.434]  Because again, it was in the Chicago Tribune and a bunch of other newspapers.
[00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:25.531]  And the newspapers were actually saying, well, maybe it's a good idea because there were discussions of expanding into different cities around the state.
[00:11:25.911 --> 00:11:30.034]  Illinois kind of being a pilot state for a lot of police state stuff.
[00:11:30.074 --> 00:11:31.255]  I guess every state is now.
[00:11:31.996 --> 00:11:41.883]  And again, it described a grandmother in her nightgown early in the morning and armed police are in her house just walking right past her like she doesn't exist.
[00:11:42.544 --> 00:11:45.366]  And then they go and give her a fine because she had two toothbrushes.
[00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:49.208]  And the little place she lived was zoned for one person.
[00:11:50.588 --> 00:11:51.649]  This is the tyranny!
[00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:53.569]  And then, well, you have two toothbrushes.
[00:11:53.609 --> 00:11:56.930]  That shows somebody else is living here.
[00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:02.832]  And I see other indicators of this around the country and other places.
[00:12:03.552 --> 00:12:07.633]  And again, I've had friends who are teetotalers, don't even drink beer.
[00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.774]  You know, so straight-laced, it's just unbelievable.
[00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:12.735]  You know, church going two, three times a week.
[00:12:14.162 --> 00:12:18.584]  And the carpet cleaner comes to their house, comes to their apartment, the plumber.
[00:12:20.064 --> 00:12:28.407]  In one case, many years ago, when I was still living in an apartment, one of my good friends lived just a few doors down from me.
[00:12:29.268 --> 00:12:37.531]  And again, this is a married football jock in college, and just a good guy.
[00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:42.550]  His girlfriend had some botany class and was growing some orchids.
[00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.411]  Little pink flower plants.
[00:12:44.492 --> 00:12:46.914]  I don't remember exactly what they were, but I remember seeing them.
[00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:49.296]  And the carpet cleaner comes in.
[00:12:49.657 --> 00:12:51.318]  So you pay this guy a bunch of money.
[00:12:51.859 --> 00:12:52.780]  Then he leaves.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.021]  And ooh, I saw grow lights.
[00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:54.561]  I saw this.
[00:12:54.601 --> 00:12:57.104]  So the SWAT team came and kicked in the door.
[00:12:57.164 --> 00:13:00.787]  And oh, these are flowers.
[00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:01.928]  We better leave.
[00:13:01.989 --> 00:13:03.390]  And just said bye-bye and left.
[00:13:04.588 --> 00:13:06.008]  So, think about this.
[00:13:06.068 --> 00:13:09.910]  You know, you pay people to come to your house and do work, and they're spying on you.
[00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:23.274]  And now under the new TIPS program, expanded into SecureCorps and the EagleEyes programs and all these new things that are out there, they're recruiting now even firefighters nationwide.
[00:13:23.694 --> 00:13:25.874]  First we learned of it in Florida earlier this year.
[00:13:25.894 --> 00:13:27.595]  Now we've learned it's actually here in Austin.
[00:13:28.811 --> 00:13:34.315]  We even went and got video at a Homeland Security conference they put on in Austin and they had the exact same flyers.
[00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:40.479]  It was just the name of Austin, Texas replacing Tampa, Florida.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:50.906]  And it said firefighters when they're in your house looking for guns or drugs or when they're recruiting the repairmen and women who come in your home.
[00:13:51.952 --> 00:14:00.818]  But now it's not just those guys you've got to worry about, because the police can't get in your house without a warrant and do giant dragnet sweeps or fishing expeditions.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:09.104]  They would always use the repairmen and people who quietly get a little kickback, you know, if they do find something.
[00:14:09.124 --> 00:14:13.828]  You know, for every ten houses that they raid, you know, if they finally find something, I guess.
[00:14:14.448 --> 00:14:16.429]  And these guys, these informants never get in trouble.
[00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.151]  But now they don't need that.
[00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:21.393]  More and more around the country are using zoning.
[00:14:23.138 --> 00:14:29.480]  They come to your house and they say, let us in, we want to inspect.
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.741]  Or, in the case of this town in Illinois, they just walk in.
[00:14:36.122 --> 00:14:39.263]  They just come into your house.
[00:14:39.283 --> 00:14:49.446]  And here it is in the Las Vegas newspaper and in Las Vegas TV station, both of them are reporting that it says that they're also going to be there looking for illegal things.
[00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:52.681]  No more 5th Amendment, no more 4th Amendment.
[00:14:52.981 --> 00:15:00.167]  Just openly, they're saying, yes, we're going to be searching for contraband while we're there checking the zoning, checking the code.
[00:15:01.188 --> 00:15:02.930]  And yeah, this is also big business.
[00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:14.800]  If you're in the good old boy network, your apartments or rent houses can have cockroaches the size of chihuahuas and horrible electrical wiring and everything else.
[00:15:17.569 --> 00:15:28.778]  And then, if you're not in the inside track, if your curb isn't, you know, is a half inch too high or something, well you have to bring a jackhammer in and replace all that.
[00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:32.821]  So it's another form of regulation and taxation.
[00:15:33.562 --> 00:15:40.588]  I don't know, I mean, we've got all the election coming up, all these serious war issues, the new national ID card.
[00:15:42.229 --> 00:15:45.512]  Patriot Act 2 legislation has passed the House and Senate.
[00:15:45.552 --> 00:15:46.853]  It's a super combo bill.
[00:15:48.399 --> 00:16:08.076]  Total information awareness, program funding, just massive national ID card program, openly, it says they're going to have checkpoints all over the country, internal passport, and then on top of it it's, as I said, got all the Patriot Act II in it.
[00:16:08.914 --> 00:16:12.116]  We should be yelling and screaming and pulling our hair out, running down the street yelling.
[00:16:12.756 --> 00:16:23.663]  I mean, this is insane, but we all just sit here calmly, and okay, they've passed it in the House and Senate, and it's in a conference committee about to go to El Presidente, and John Kerry says he'll sign it, you know, it doesn't matter if he gets elected.
[00:16:24.363 --> 00:16:31.408]  All the liberals out there that have been against the Patriot Act 1 and 2, because Bush has been in, you watch, they're suddenly going to love it when Kerry gets in.
[00:16:31.488 --> 00:16:33.829]  Well, I guess it's actually needed.
[00:16:33.849 --> 00:16:38.372]  You know, it's really needed for those homeschoolers, and those right-wing militia people, and those
[00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:41.682]  You know, those type of dangerous folks.
[00:16:41.742 --> 00:16:52.792]  Yeah, because quietly, the drills aren't to stop some Muslim terrorist with a bomb strapped to him, which, by the way, are about as rare as goonie birds.
[00:16:54.654 --> 00:16:55.494]  Or dodo birds.
[00:16:56.775 --> 00:17:04.743]  But let's just say, magically, one of those terrorists really exists that isn't a CIA puppet, or a provocateur, or a patsy.
[00:17:05.785 --> 00:17:06.686]  They're not looking for them.
[00:17:06.746 --> 00:17:11.569]  And the drills are for gun owners, people that won't give up their farms and ranches.
[00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:14.031]  They have drills with the troops how to slaughter you and your family.
[00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:19.975]  The drills are for mass roundups of schools, entire neighborhoods, forced inoculations.
[00:17:20.416 --> 00:17:22.977]  Homeschoolers are absolute terrorists.
[00:17:23.037 --> 00:17:24.138]  Training goes on everywhere.
[00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:27.160]  And that just came out in Michigan in the major papers.
[00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:34.990]  There's been national editorials about it, but folks, I mean, I made a film two and a half years ago where I show the documents.
[00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.230]  It's nothing new.
[00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:45.533]  They say all Christians, all founding fathers, all homeschoolers, all those that believe in Jesus Christ and the Second Coming are Taverist.
[00:17:46.613 --> 00:17:48.173]  I mean, I'm not joking about this.
[00:17:48.814 --> 00:17:51.034]  That's what they're training them all over for right now.
[00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:54.395]  And, you know, that's what it's all for.
[00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:57.496]  And so Bush is their go-to guy.
[00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:28.489]  and uh... you know they do this uh... they do this uh... fake handoff to Bush and he runs through where all the liberals are distracted by him and then Kerry runs through and gets the touchdown on us and everybody then suddenly goes well I guess it's you know Kerry we've had a change of horses uh... he's really shown George W. and I guess now we support all this police state of course I've been saying the last two years that I thought George W. Bush would win
[00:18:29.574 --> 00:18:42.560]  And then about five months ago, four months ago, the New York Times came out and said that, well, the Bilderberg Group actually called Kerry up and said, we want John Edwards.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.041]  And then I said, that's incredible.
[00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:48.922]  And then there was another New York Times article saying the same thing, in case we didn't get it.
[00:18:49.342 --> 00:18:54.945]  And then in case that wasn't enough, some people were still denying this, he then went on Larry King Live and said this.
[00:18:57.145 --> 00:18:58.646]  I have the transcript from Larry King Live.
[00:18:58.686 --> 00:19:02.909]  I'd love it if you had the video of it.
[00:19:03.269 --> 00:19:05.071]  So I thought, maybe everybody's right.
[00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:09.134]  Because, you know, Kerry was ahead in the polls then, and I said, maybe I've been wrong.
[00:19:10.194 --> 00:19:11.395]  But I've said this all along.
[00:19:11.675 --> 00:19:23.243]  If Kerry wins, then it really does show that there is a
[00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.031]  Not a fissure in the New World Order.
[00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:31.512]  Because you've got the Bilderberg Group publicly endorsing him.
[00:19:32.912 --> 00:19:33.913]  That's something they've never done.
[00:19:35.733 --> 00:19:39.795]  And then you've got Bush over here with all these different elites behind him.
[00:19:40.815 --> 00:19:52.039]  If Bush wins, after this Bilderberg Group endorsement, that really means there is a separation between the elites at a very high level.
[00:19:52.099 --> 00:19:53.159]  At least a fracture.
[00:19:54.338 --> 00:19:59.939]  We'll be right back, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, a ton of news in your calls, coming up.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.821]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:08.762]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:20:09.262 --> 00:20:09.942]  Let's update.
[00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:15.183]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:20:15.803 --> 00:20:18.164]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[00:20:18.934 --> 00:20:19.895]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:20:19.915 --> 00:20:22.237]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:20:22.758 --> 00:20:23.678]  Today, the U.S.
[00:20:23.698 --> 00:20:25.921]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:20:26.321 --> 00:20:27.842]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:20:28.423 --> 00:20:30.405]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[00:20:31.766 --> 00:20:36.630]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:20:37.631 --> 00:20:38.372]  Gold is moving.
[00:20:38.632 --> 00:20:39.773]  Equities are treading water.
[00:20:40.194 --> 00:20:42.736]  There's little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:44.732]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:20:45.173 --> 00:20:46.894]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:20:47.315 --> 00:20:49.257]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:20:49.677 --> 00:20:51.799]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.

[00:21:06.842 --> 00:21:08.942]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[00:21:08.962 --> 00:21:14.104]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[00:21:14.424 --> 00:21:15.784]  It actually works.
[00:21:16.205 --> 00:21:19.586]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.

[00:21:21.326 --> 00:21:23.567]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenated.
[00:21:23.967 --> 00:21:27.288]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[00:21:27.978 --> 00:21:28.619]  It truly works.
[00:21:28.979 --> 00:21:30.341]  Collagenate is wonderful.

[00:22:02.992 --> 00:22:07.476]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:22:07.816 --> 00:22:11.920]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:12.761]  We listened.
[00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:18.045]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:22:18.346 --> 00:22:18.826]  We listened.
[00:22:19.206 --> 00:22:22.249]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:23.170]  We listened.
[00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.711]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:22:28.091 --> 00:22:28.592]  We listened.
[00:22:28.932 --> 00:22:34.173]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:22:34.573 --> 00:22:35.934]  Again, we listened.
[00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:43.696]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[00:24:07.623 --> 00:24:08.904]  I ran hopes for Bush re-election!
[00:24:08.944 --> 00:24:10.024]  Wow, that's out of Japan today.
[00:24:10.044 --> 00:24:11.405]  So Bush now has Vladimir Putin's endorsement.
[00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.371]  He now has Iran's endorsement.
[00:24:38.492 --> 00:24:42.815]  Of course, his daddy had Saddam Hussein's endorsement.
[00:24:42.835 --> 00:24:45.336]  They were good business partners in BCCI.
[00:24:45.996 --> 00:24:51.500]  The head of Iran's Security Council said Tuesday that the re-election of U.S.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:25:03.087]  President George W. Bush was in Tehran's best interest, despite the administration's axis of evil label, accusations that Iran harbors al Qaeda terrorists,
[00:25:03.758 --> 00:25:06.660]  And threats of sanctions over the country's nuclear ambitions.
[00:25:07.221 --> 00:25:17.829]  Historically, Democrats have harmed Iran more than Republicans, said Hassan Rouhani, head of the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's top security decision-making body.
[00:25:18.449 --> 00:25:23.493]  We haven't seen anything good from Democrats, Rouhani told state-run television remarks.
[00:25:23.873 --> 00:25:28.577]  For the first time in recent decades, saw Iran openly supporting one U.S.
[00:25:28.637 --> 00:25:30.398]  presidential candidate over another.
[00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:32.610]  Well, yeah.
[00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:37.073]  I mean, whether you love or hate Ronald Reagan, folks, George Bush Sr.
[00:25:37.113 --> 00:25:40.214]  did pull off the arms for hostages.
[00:25:40.274 --> 00:25:42.015]  They did have them keep our people longer.
[00:25:42.075 --> 00:25:43.516]  That's now publicly admitted.
[00:25:43.956 --> 00:25:47.318]  The Iranians know how to work with the Bushes.
[00:25:48.479 --> 00:25:58.164]  And the Iranians, our government's been selling them nuclear weapons components and oil field equipment and has been keeping a lot of the sanctions off.
[00:25:58.244 --> 00:26:00.986]  And, you know, that's just the way it is.
[00:26:02.714 --> 00:26:06.696]  And it says, um, though Iran generally does not publicly wade into U.S.
[00:26:06.736 --> 00:26:13.040]  presidential politics, it has a history of preferring Republicans over Democrats who tend to press human rights issues.
[00:26:14.641 --> 00:26:21.765]  We do not desire to see Democrats take over, Rouhani said, when asked if Iran was supporting Democratic Senator John Kerry against Bush.
[00:26:22.639 --> 00:26:29.705]  The Bush campaign said, no thanks, it's not an endorsement, we'll be accepting any time soon, except in our Swiss bank accounts, thank you.
[00:26:30.305 --> 00:26:31.006]  It didn't say that.
[00:26:31.266 --> 00:26:35.569]  The Bush campaign said, no thanks, it's not an endorsement, we'll be accepting any time soon.
[00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:48.560]  Bush campaign spokesman Scott Stanzell said, Iran should stop its pursuit of new air weapons, and if they continue in that direction they're going, then they will have to look at what additional action may be needed
[00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:53.911]  to be taken, including looking to the UN Security Council.
[00:26:55.652 --> 00:27:05.675]  Gary, who says halting nuclear proliferation will be a priority if he becomes president, believes Bush should have done more diplomatically to curb Iran's alleged nuclear weapons ambitions.
[00:27:05.995 --> 00:27:16.398]  He says Iran should be offered nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes, but spent fuel should be taken back so it cannot be used to develop nuclear weapons.
[00:27:18.573 --> 00:27:30.016]  Folks, we went into Iraq because it was a pushover under 12, 13 years of sanctions because they had literal 1950s and 60s worn out, rusted weapons.
[00:27:32.096 --> 00:27:32.917]  They had nothing.
[00:27:34.237 --> 00:27:46.120]  And because almost his entire apparatus was trained and put into power by our government, the Republican Guard, they'd already covertly paid off most of them, they went into Iraq because it was a pushover.
[00:27:48.382 --> 00:27:58.733]  And people point out, well why are we going into Iraq if Bin Laden, Al-Syeda leader, Bush's business partner, is in Afghanistan?
[00:27:59.474 --> 00:28:01.216]  Or in Pakistan, our other big ally?
[00:28:01.897 --> 00:28:08.184]  Or North Korea is threatening to nuke us again, but you don't have any proof that Saddam has any of these weapons.
[00:28:08.997 --> 00:28:17.363]  All this was, was an exercise into making everybody hear, the UN says, you broke UN rules, we'll have to enforce them for you, UN.
[00:28:17.383 --> 00:28:24.569]  The UN is the global authority now, and we've got to follow their orders, UN, UN, UN, UN.
[00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:36.478]  And then now, we play the part of the bad cop going in and taking over, and the international corporations take control of the oil and use Iraq as a launch base, and the UN later comes in and plays the part of the good cop.
[00:28:38.177 --> 00:28:47.000]  Creating a false bipolar world when we really have a single pole or mono-pole world.
[00:28:48.381 --> 00:28:49.661]  And so that's what they're doing.
[00:28:51.242 --> 00:28:59.044]  And so we rage forward now with Israel with subs, with nuclear weapons, cruise missiles aimed at Iran.
[00:28:59.824 --> 00:29:02.906]  Openly saying they may attack them in the next few weeks, the next few months.
[00:29:02.966 --> 00:29:04.086]  This is openly being stated.
[00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.491]  A lot of the big financial publications are saying it's going to happen.
[00:29:07.532 --> 00:29:08.972]  Governments are saying it's going to happen.
[00:29:09.973 --> 00:29:11.514]  Israel's threatening to attack any minute.
[00:29:11.574 --> 00:29:13.375]  Our government's saying they'll back Israel up.
[00:29:14.475 --> 00:29:16.596]  And then World War III starts.
[00:29:16.737 --> 00:29:18.938]  The Iranians are not the Iraqis.
[00:29:22.019 --> 00:29:24.961]  And they do probably have a couple bombs.
[00:29:25.181 --> 00:29:26.282]  No one's quite sure.
[00:29:26.302 --> 00:29:34.006]  Hey, but out of a controlled nuclear war, imagine the police state we'll have at home.
[00:29:35.282 --> 00:29:40.247]  You won't complain about having your kids psychologically tested or zoning inspections of your home every year.
[00:29:41.287 --> 00:29:45.812]  You won't worry about checkpoints to search you and cops wearing black ski masks.
[00:29:45.852 --> 00:29:47.853]  That's just a sign of freedom.
[00:29:48.394 --> 00:29:49.034]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.757 --> 00:29:52.678]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.760]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.343]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:04.143]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:30:04.404 --> 00:30:08.228]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:30:08.568 --> 00:30:09.369]  Read the labels.
[00:30:09.809 --> 00:30:13.933]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:30:14.153 --> 00:30:18.338]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:30:18.718 --> 00:30:23.583]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:30:23.963 --> 00:30:27.545]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:30:27.726 --> 00:30:33.089]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:30:33.349 --> 00:30:36.091]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:30:36.371 --> 00:30:37.272]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:37.592 --> 00:30:48.319]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:31:01.215 --> 00:31:07.460]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:13.764]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.025 --> 00:31:22.411]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:22.711 --> 00:31:29.758]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.038 --> 00:31:34.883]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.083 --> 00:31:40.488]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:40.848 --> 00:31:43.871]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:52.163]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Bass for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:01.798 --> 00:32:03.279]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:32:03.479 --> 00:32:10.824]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:32:11.144 --> 00:32:15.547]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:32:15.827 --> 00:32:25.653]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:32:26.413 --> 00:32:30.074]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:32:30.414 --> 00:32:32.935]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:32:33.195 --> 00:32:39.117]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:32:39.377 --> 00:32:40.938]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:32:41.198 --> 00:32:42.078]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:32:42.158 --> 00:32:45.139]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:32:45.319 --> 00:32:46.220]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:46.460]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.581]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:50.541]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:33:11.507 --> 00:33:15.709]  Your calls are coming up momentarily on this live Thursday edition.
[00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.832]  I'd like to get your take on who you think is going to win the election.
[00:33:19.852 --> 00:33:22.433]  You think we'll have terrorist attacks.
[00:33:23.074 --> 00:33:25.635]  There's been open discussions of suspending or cancelling it.
[00:33:27.476 --> 00:33:29.337]  The government's now putting out mixed signals.
[00:33:29.397 --> 00:33:33.460]  Dick Cheney is saying, Armageddon if you don't vote for me, nuclear attack!
[00:33:34.983 --> 00:33:41.424]  And then, we have a Senator evacuate the Capitol because of an internal threat, and they go, oh, what a coward!
[00:33:43.685 --> 00:33:48.265]  I don't know what's going to happen, but we live in interesting times, that's for sure.
[00:33:48.285 --> 00:33:48.986]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:49.006 --> 00:33:52.746]  And we're about to go to those calls.
[00:33:53.626 --> 00:33:57.747]  But, uh, some of the other news that'll then come up, I mean, I just love it.
[00:33:57.907 --> 00:33:59.747]  Iran hopes for Bush re-election.
[00:33:59.767 --> 00:34:02.368]  So he's got Putin and Iran for him now.
[00:34:04.591 --> 00:34:06.513]  Interesting little email I got here.
[00:34:07.293 --> 00:34:10.656]  I didn't see this myself, but did you see it?
[00:34:11.537 --> 00:34:16.701]  CSI Miami, that's the CIA show, which I've seen a few times.
[00:34:16.781 --> 00:34:19.223]  It's total New World Order, police state propaganda.
[00:34:19.744 --> 00:34:25.889]  To get into the really cool club, all the most beautiful women, the email says, are the coolest.
[00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:27.030]  They all have the chip.
[00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:33.615]  The person writing the email said that without the background knowledge from these broadcasts,
[00:34:34.852 --> 00:34:39.614]  He would have just been sucked into it and been conditioned that it was the end thing to do.
[00:34:40.555 --> 00:34:44.356]  Did you see CSI Miami telling us how great the chips are?
[00:34:45.897 --> 00:34:50.479]  Australia has joined an exercise off Japan despite North Korea's warnings they may attack it.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:57.722]  And then of course we also have lawmakers prod CIA for pre 9-11 accountability report.
[00:34:58.343 --> 00:35:01.364]  They've now got some new report that Porter Goss doesn't want released.
[00:35:02.353 --> 00:35:04.855]  We mentioned this yesterday, but now there's been some new developments.
[00:35:05.895 --> 00:35:13.240]  Tehran, that's the capital there of Iran, shows defiance on eve of crucial nuclear arms talks by test firing a missile.
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:19.864]  Israel on alert as rumors circulate of right-wing plot to assassinate Sharon.
[00:35:20.424 --> 00:35:23.626]  Pentagon says no need for a U.S.
[00:35:23.766 --> 00:35:24.967]  draft of doctors.
[00:35:26.454 --> 00:35:48.843]  So the New York Times comes out with the admitted document from the Selective Service how they're preparing for a draft of medical workers and doctors and two days later the Pentagon responds in Reuters and said that it does not need or want a draft of doctors or other medical workers even as another agency updates contingency plans for such a draft in the event of a national catastrophe.
[00:35:50.163 --> 00:35:53.885]  So again, there is no Patriot Act but I introduced it and please pass it.
[00:35:55.089 --> 00:35:57.510]  There is no national ID card, but we sure need it.
[00:35:57.851 --> 00:35:58.431]  It's introduced.
[00:35:58.491 --> 00:35:59.251]  Please pass it.
[00:35:59.311 --> 00:36:01.412]  I mean, this is what they... There is no draft.
[00:36:01.452 --> 00:36:03.153]  We're just trying to pass one right now.
[00:36:06.135 --> 00:36:07.115]  Here's an interesting article.
[00:36:07.876 --> 00:36:15.120]  Pastor Charged, after calling Bible a bomb, they asked him, they said, Do you have any bombs?
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:16.741]  Any explosives?
[00:36:16.761 --> 00:36:19.542]  And he said, This is my bomb, young man.
[00:36:20.142 --> 00:36:21.123]  Holding up his Bible.
[00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:27.752]  And they said, you're charged with telling a false statement to a federal officer.
[00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:29.473]  It's like it's God or something.
[00:36:30.033 --> 00:36:33.453]  You are charged with lying to the all high.
[00:36:33.473 --> 00:36:36.194]  All these new laws.
[00:36:36.614 --> 00:36:40.135]  You just lied to a federal officer.
[00:36:41.455 --> 00:36:42.735]  Lying to one of us.
[00:36:43.276 --> 00:36:46.836]  All we do is lie to you, but you lie to us.
[00:36:46.876 --> 00:36:48.777]  Of course, the guy wasn't lying.
[00:36:48.797 --> 00:36:49.937]  He was being sarcastic.
[00:36:51.024 --> 00:36:52.565]  That just sounds like something a preacher would say.
[00:36:52.945 --> 00:36:54.807]  This is my bomb, sonny!
[00:36:54.847 --> 00:36:55.727]  The Bible!
[00:36:55.827 --> 00:36:57.228]  What, I'm arrested?
[00:36:57.509 --> 00:36:58.129]  What?
[00:36:58.529 --> 00:36:59.450]  That's it, boy.
[00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.511]  You're facing decades in prison.
[00:37:02.592 --> 00:37:07.475]  You'll make a good worker in one of our private prisons owned by the drug dealers.
[00:37:09.077 --> 00:37:09.477]  That's right.
[00:37:09.497 --> 00:37:12.379]  They ship the drugs in and the same drug dealing families own the private prisons.
[00:37:12.719 --> 00:37:13.640]  It's a great new system.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.161]  Alright, folks.
[00:37:15.761 --> 00:37:17.142]  Sorry if I sound a little strange today.
[00:37:17.182 --> 00:37:19.444]  I feel like I've got an ice pick stuck in my lower lumbar.
[00:37:20.991 --> 00:37:22.992]  Uh, let us go to the calls.
[00:37:23.792 --> 00:37:26.212]  Jim, in Michigan.
[00:37:26.252 --> 00:37:27.273]  You're on the air, Jim.
[00:37:27.313 --> 00:37:27.653]  Welcome.
[00:37:28.073 --> 00:37:29.153]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:37:29.433 --> 00:37:29.953]  Good, sir.
[00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:33.774]  Hey, I got a question, a couple comments, and some good and bad news.
[00:37:34.234 --> 00:37:37.575]  Who do you think is the biggest enemy of communism?
[00:37:38.355 --> 00:37:39.475]  Or their biggest enemy?
[00:37:40.976 --> 00:37:42.536]  And what do they have to destroy?
[00:37:43.157 --> 00:37:50.343]  Well, I would have to say the biggest enemy of communism is Christian conservatives that don't want to be absorbed into the Borg Collective.
[00:37:50.923 --> 00:37:53.725]  I say the Catholic Church, and they're doing a good job on it.
[00:37:53.785 --> 00:37:56.027]  Most of my friends that are Catholic are brain-dead.
[00:37:56.748 --> 00:38:00.391]  They've been so mind-screwed by the Masonic infiltration, it's unreal.
[00:38:01.331 --> 00:38:05.575]  Have you ever interviewed Father Gruner or Father John O'Connor?
[00:38:06.535 --> 00:38:07.216]  No, I haven't.
[00:38:07.576 --> 00:38:09.858]  Well, boy, both of them would interview you.
[00:38:09.898 --> 00:38:11.179]  They know what's going on.
[00:38:13.428 --> 00:38:19.813]  Father Gruner is Fatima.org and Father John O'Connor is the one that advertises and puts out the video back into militia.
[00:38:20.714 --> 00:38:23.337]  He used to advertise in the spotlight and still advertises.
[00:38:23.377 --> 00:38:25.859]  No, I've actually seen that ad.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.963]  The bad news is Carl Miller is in custody.
[00:38:30.003 --> 00:38:31.724]  You might have known about that already.
[00:38:31.904 --> 00:38:33.346]  Yeah, tell folks about that.
[00:38:33.926 --> 00:38:35.928]  Carl Miller is one of the best patriot lawyers.
[00:38:35.968 --> 00:38:37.810]  He was wounded six times in Vietnam.
[00:38:38.473 --> 00:38:43.355]  And he's helped people all over the United States, probably even gone out of this country, as far as I know.
[00:38:44.115 --> 00:38:46.776]  And he's got total recall.
[00:38:47.476 --> 00:38:49.237]  I used to go with him to court.
[00:38:49.357 --> 00:38:51.018]  He had a brief I couldn't even pick up.
[00:38:51.138 --> 00:38:52.198]  I mean, it was a bag.
[00:38:52.598 --> 00:38:54.459]  And he could pick out anything out of that.
[00:38:54.739 --> 00:38:57.120]  And he smoked the judges.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:02.722]  The last time he was in court that I knew of, he told, the judge called him in the chamber.
[00:39:02.782 --> 00:39:06.103]  He says, you can't use this, you can't use this, you can't use this, and just neutered him.
[00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:13.359]  And so he was supposedly on a lam because they were after him for a gun charge, a clear and concealed weapon.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:19.748]  And I went to Mount Clemens the last time they had him on that and they let him give him five years probation.
[00:39:20.369 --> 00:39:21.130]  By the way, Jim,
[00:39:23.119 --> 00:39:35.422]  Europe and Michigan, how did people respond to the federally funded mandated drills where they simulate vicious homeschooler parents slaughtering children by the hundreds, bombing, machine gunning?
[00:39:35.942 --> 00:39:36.702]  Never happened.
[00:39:37.063 --> 00:39:42.144]  Lowest crime rate, highest scores, corporations fighting to get homeschoolers.
[00:39:43.104 --> 00:39:46.925]  But meanwhile the feds are simulating homeschoolers slaughtering everyone.
[00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:53.772]  With hundreds of children role-playing with fake blood packs all learning how evil homeschooling is.
[00:39:54.312 --> 00:39:58.274]  Well, I've known they've done some of this, but I am not that well informed about that Alex.
[00:39:58.694 --> 00:39:59.594]  Well, you're up in Michigan.
[00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:03.475]  It just came out in a bunch of your newspapers.
[00:40:03.516 --> 00:40:16.180]  Oh, well the good news is they had one guy, Dr. Matthias Roth, put two full-page ads last Friday in the Detroit News and in the Free Press
[00:40:17.162 --> 00:40:18.324]  Did you ever see a copy of it?
[00:40:18.544 --> 00:40:18.764]  No.
[00:40:18.985 --> 00:40:19.666]  I'll send you one.
[00:40:20.166 --> 00:40:23.171]  Hey, I just want to add that Jim's kind of a celebrity.
[00:40:23.552 --> 00:40:30.122]  Jim's even said in the news articles, Jim is the founder, hadn't called in probably six months, Jim is the founder of Domino's Pizza!
[00:40:32.775 --> 00:40:34.877]  Well, I love my brother, but he's brain-dead.
[00:40:36.939 --> 00:40:40.641]  He prays, he says the rosary for me, and I say it for him.
[00:40:40.982 --> 00:40:43.404]  George Bush, do not start World War III.
[00:40:43.724 --> 00:40:47.007]  That's what the headline's on this whole page there, and then he's got questions.
[00:40:47.047 --> 00:40:47.987]  Oh yeah, I did hear about that.
[00:40:48.187 --> 00:40:51.670]  Hey, but tell me, who do you think's going to win the election?
[00:40:52.771 --> 00:40:54.753]  Well, I'm voting for Patoko, like you are.
[00:40:54.933 --> 00:40:56.094]  Yeah.
[00:40:56.254 --> 00:40:59.036]  I'm not voting for Communist Number One or Communist Number Two.
[00:40:59.376 --> 00:41:01.278]  Well, I'll tell you this, Jim, I'll tell you this.
[00:41:02.297 --> 00:41:04.418]  No matter who wins, we lose.
[00:41:05.498 --> 00:41:08.199]  With those two, I mean, I know who's going to be in the White House.
[00:41:08.319 --> 00:41:12.040]  I know 100% who's going to be in the White House November 3rd.
[00:41:13.661 --> 00:41:16.541]  Of course, it'll actually be January 22nd, but... Terry?
[00:41:18.022 --> 00:41:19.622]  Skull and Bones will be in the White House.
[00:41:20.843 --> 00:41:21.723]  Thanks for the call, Jim.
[00:41:22.123 --> 00:41:22.983]  Jim, good to hear from you.
[00:41:23.023 --> 00:41:23.984]  Always good to hear from you.
[00:41:24.644 --> 00:41:25.704]  Chad in Nebraska.
[00:41:25.724 --> 00:41:26.544]  Chad, you're on the air.
[00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:27.005]  Go ahead.
[00:41:28.645 --> 00:41:28.985]  Hey, Alex?
[00:41:29.325 --> 00:41:29.605]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:29.625 --> 00:41:31.746]  Do you think you can come back to me in just a few minutes?
[00:41:32.508 --> 00:41:32.949]  Later on?
[00:41:35.531 --> 00:41:37.593]  I'm up there, I'm talking to the DOT right now.
[00:41:37.613 --> 00:41:39.214]  I'm on a truck driver.
[00:41:39.735 --> 00:41:40.776]  Oh, they just pulled you over?
[00:41:40.796 --> 00:41:46.541]  Yeah, they're doing an inspection, or he's doing an inspection walk around, but I'm still, I've got you on my earphone.
[00:41:47.081 --> 00:41:49.303]  Okay, we'll come back to you after you're done showing your papers.
[00:41:49.784 --> 00:41:50.284]  I appreciate it.
[00:41:50.684 --> 00:41:55.729]  Sure, hey, that's part of all Americans' birthrights, being constantly searched and surveilled and tracked and controlled.
[00:41:56.764 --> 00:41:57.784]  The slick boot.
[00:41:58.665 --> 00:42:00.906]  I'm joking folks, we'll come right back to you Chad.
[00:42:01.486 --> 00:42:02.746]  Who's up next in order here?
[00:42:04.187 --> 00:42:05.267]  John in New York!
[00:42:05.668 --> 00:42:07.008]  You're on the air, go ahead John.
[00:42:07.208 --> 00:42:12.070]  Yeah, I believe they're closing the gate on this Gestapo type takeover.
[00:42:12.971 --> 00:42:16.912]  Beware of these home inspections because that's going to lead to gun confiscation.
[00:42:16.972 --> 00:42:21.554]  I mean, they're going to start out with all these garbage reasons as to why they're doing it.
[00:42:21.594 --> 00:42:23.995]  You know, for fire prevention and all this other garbage.
[00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:30.596]  But the real ulterior motive there is that it's going to be the Gestapo coming through your house to confiscate your property.
[00:42:30.616 --> 00:42:32.337]  Well, it's not an ulterior motive.
[00:42:32.377 --> 00:42:40.025]  The law in Las Vegas says they're going to inspect for illegal things, period, and total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:42:40.505 --> 00:42:47.592]  Well, when you combine that with the Gestapo-type checkpoints, like if you want to meet up with your partner to, you know, defend your homeland,
[00:42:48.843 --> 00:42:56.092]  You won't even be able to do that because if the Gestapo type checkpoints on the streets, they're going to be taking guns away and stuff there too.
[00:42:56.613 --> 00:42:58.135]  So it's a total takeover.
[00:42:58.295 --> 00:42:59.937]  If people don't realize that, they're...
[00:43:01.362 --> 00:43:07.386]  Well again, there's this Illinois city that we covered years ago and interviewed the local reporters about it.
[00:43:07.406 --> 00:43:08.506]  They just thought it was normal.
[00:43:09.107 --> 00:43:10.427]  The police don't even ask.
[00:43:10.547 --> 00:43:18.872]  They just pick your lock and walk in, usually in the middle of the night, to quote inspect, because of the zoning laws, how many people can live in your house.
[00:43:19.032 --> 00:43:20.913]  Even if you own your house, it's everybody.
[00:43:21.513 --> 00:43:25.976]  And it described old ladies, families, you wake up and police are at the foot of your bed.
[00:43:26.716 --> 00:43:28.117]  That's not the real motive there.
[00:43:28.137 --> 00:43:30.518]  The real motive is to search and confiscate weapons.
[00:43:31.199 --> 00:43:35.441]  That way they could totally disarm us before they could finally move in to take us over.
[00:43:35.501 --> 00:43:36.181]  Well, that's true.
[00:43:36.221 --> 00:43:41.805]  There's a real desire on the part of at least the leaders of police departments to do this.
[00:43:41.845 --> 00:43:51.290]  I mean, it's like up in Wisconsin, in Oshkosh, a few months ago, they confiscated the guns in a whole neighborhood.
[00:43:52.931 --> 00:43:54.752]  So, it's all part of the new freedom.
[00:43:56.917 --> 00:43:57.857]  Anything else, Sean?
[00:43:57.897 --> 00:44:03.520]  Yeah, that scumbag Pat Rodgerson's all for this New World Order garbage, too.
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:05.500]  It's a shame.
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:13.583]  He's got all these people following him, and all he wants to do is talk about the New World Order and how great it is, and he's all for Bush.
[00:44:15.084 --> 00:44:22.567]  I think the New World Order will probably keep Bush in there only because he's got his dream team already in place and all his henchmen.
[00:44:23.667 --> 00:44:26.168]  With Kerry, they'd have to set up a whole new
[00:44:27.063 --> 00:44:30.648]  Well, it's all been incremental, but when you put a piece of paper
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:45:09.277]  In an oven and turn it up first it yellows and it browns and then you know it's all incremental and then suddenly it flashes into flames and I think we're approaching that Fahrenheit where it just at a certain point it goes over the edge but we're over the edge when they have passed now it's just going to leave conference committee
[00:45:10.277 --> 00:45:15.481]  A National ID Card, Patriot Act 2, Total Information Awareness Network, all rolled into one.
[00:45:17.302 --> 00:45:30.210]  And when they're going to forcibly, psychologically test every American, starting with the school children, several times a year, and when they can say that they're going to have checkpoints on every road, and meanwhile the border's wide open.
[00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:31.171]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:45:32.292 --> 00:45:34.673]  I mean, it's just, it's so transparent.
[00:45:36.574 --> 00:45:38.916]  None of this has anything to do with keeping us safe.
[00:45:39.594 --> 00:45:41.576]  Corporations bought up the government.
[00:45:41.976 --> 00:45:47.101]  They're now using government to raise taxes, to run our lives, to create all these regulations.
[00:45:47.742 --> 00:45:52.386]  The government then hands all the profits of that over to the private corporations that quote, administer the government.
[00:45:53.086 --> 00:45:57.491]  And then everything is shifting into prisons, police, surveillance, military.
[00:45:58.772 --> 00:46:00.894]  It's all shifting into control.
[00:46:01.855 --> 00:46:04.357]  The economy is leaving free market
[00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:09.478]  I mean, you go to the major colleges and look at what they're promoting as the majors now.
[00:46:09.598 --> 00:46:11.520]  It's not engineering.
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.521]  It's not even teaching.
[00:46:13.601 --> 00:46:19.666]  It's homeland security, law enforcement, criminal justice.
[00:46:21.827 --> 00:46:25.730]  So we're going to have a nation of lawyers.
[00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:31.414]  You know, there are more lawyers in school right now to be lawyers than there are current practicing lawyers.
[00:46:31.654 --> 00:46:32.835]  Just the current crop
[00:46:34.657 --> 00:46:41.341]  of lawyers that are out there practicing is smaller than the new crop that is in college right now, that is in law school.
[00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:55.969]  So we're going to have a nation of lawyers and people in black ski masks marching around in armored vehicles and surveillance blimps and psychiatrists and welfare workers and social workers and... It's all for your own good!
[00:46:55.989 --> 00:46:56.789]  It's all to keep you safe!
[00:46:57.149 --> 00:46:59.130]  Why, we have to raid your house to stop the drugs.
[00:46:59.631 --> 00:47:02.052]  You may be doing drugs, but by the way, we ship it all in.
[00:47:03.863 --> 00:47:05.263]  It's just, it's incredible.
[00:47:05.423 --> 00:47:08.764]  Marie in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:47:10.565 --> 00:47:11.625]  Marie hung up.
[00:47:12.305 --> 00:47:13.625]  We'll go to Danny in Tennessee.
[00:47:13.645 --> 00:47:14.405]  Danny, go ahead.
[00:47:14.966 --> 00:47:15.946]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:47:16.146 --> 00:47:16.526]  Good, sir.
[00:47:16.826 --> 00:47:24.968]  Hey, I just wanted to call and let you know, I was, about seven or eight months ago, I was researching the New World Order and getting some stuff via the Freedom of Information Act.
[00:47:26.068 --> 00:47:30.389]  And it was around the time we had first started talking about the draft and the different bills.
[00:47:31.463 --> 00:47:43.513]  And I had asked my Senator, I'm sorry, Lamar Alexander, I was talking to one of his staff members and we got to talking about the draft and he had told me that, well, we're not going to have a draft.
[00:47:43.613 --> 00:47:48.758]  What we're going to do is we're going to add a battalion to every division in the military.
[00:47:49.518 --> 00:47:59.607]  So today I was just reading on the internet Terry's plan for the military and it's the exact same thing that my Republican Senator told me they were going to do.
[00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:01.971]  I mean, down to the very word.
[00:48:02.651 --> 00:48:08.294]  And it was just another illustration to me of how there's not a dime worth of difference between the two parties.
[00:48:08.894 --> 00:48:10.215]  Well, here's another question.
[00:48:10.835 --> 00:48:18.178]  The Army told them 400,000 troops to 500,000 to really do the job right in Iraq, whether you're for or against the war.
[00:48:18.498 --> 00:48:21.300]  You might as well, if you're going to be there, though, you know, do it right.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:21.860]  Right.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.881]  Instead of total bedlam, which it is now.
[00:48:24.574 --> 00:48:28.057]  Shoot anything that moves, just salt the earth, blow everything up.
[00:48:28.077 --> 00:48:28.857]  That's what's been happening.
[00:48:29.198 --> 00:48:39.466]  Burn, baby, burn, as the troops sing, as they burn down whole towns and arrest every man over the age of ten years of age and take them to one of the thirty-two camps.
[00:48:40.727 --> 00:48:51.535]  But, if they're having to do stop-loss and not letting troops leave the military who've already served, and if their recruiting is off by, in some cases, half,
[00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:53.851]  Different branches of the armed services.
[00:48:54.432 --> 00:48:56.013]  How are they not going to have a draft?
[00:48:56.053 --> 00:48:57.594]  Well, see, they're not going to call it a draft.
[00:48:58.034 --> 00:48:59.775]  It's called National Service.
[00:49:00.215 --> 00:49:00.596]  Right.
[00:49:00.996 --> 00:49:06.500]  Well, you know, another thing is all the guys that are going to be sick and be disabled from the DU poisoning.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.021]  I mean, there's no telling.
[00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:10.342]  That's already coming out now.
[00:49:10.602 --> 00:49:20.369]  Yeah, I just read an article on RENT this morning from the Italian Ministry of Health that 41% of their fatalities was from depleted uranium poisoning.
[00:49:20.973 --> 00:49:23.575]  So how many of our guys are dropping dead now from DU?
[00:49:24.135 --> 00:49:26.356]  That's what's killing me right now.
[00:49:28.278 --> 00:49:28.938]  Unbelievable.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:45.488]  Well, I mean, we've had the man who literally wrote the books, made the videos for training, the doctor, Dr. Rocky, who has been the head of the DU program since the mid-1980s, and in 1992 they sent him to Iraq
[00:49:48.864 --> 00:49:51.586]  to study the areas where it had been used.
[00:49:52.306 --> 00:50:17.482]  It was the first time they used it in major combat since then it's been used in Serbia and Afghanistan and Iraq now for the second time, so four times and each time they escalate the tons of it that are used but he went there to quote study it for the Pentagon and he was a supporter of DU but did say it was deadly poison and you had to, you know, it was only used it was only to be used if the Russians poured across into Western Europe with
[00:50:18.708 --> 00:50:20.650]  Uh, you know, heavy divisions of tanks.
[00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:27.635]  It was an emergency thing to load into the tanks and load into the warthogs, the tank killers, to go and stop them.
[00:50:28.336 --> 00:50:30.357]  And we didn't mean, it's a form of nuclear war.
[00:50:30.917 --> 00:50:31.218]  Right.
[00:50:31.458 --> 00:50:38.843]  Uh, and, uh, but no, they went ahead and used it conventionally in the first Gulf War, and he went there and most of his team is dead, he's very sick.
[00:50:38.863 --> 00:50:42.126]  Uh, they find all this radiation in their blood, heavy metal.
[00:50:43.417 --> 00:50:45.940]  And this time they used about 10 times more.
[00:50:46.501 --> 00:50:50.105]  But they didn't just bombard the desert, they bombarded all the major cities.
[00:50:50.645 --> 00:50:52.647]  The bases where our troops later moved into.
[00:50:52.667 --> 00:50:54.830]  So the tragedy is going to be much greater.
[00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:56.231]  Yeah, and they had to know.
[00:50:57.192 --> 00:50:57.913]  Of course they knew.
[00:50:58.073 --> 00:50:58.654]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:05.973]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.153 --> 00:51:10.556]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.716 --> 00:51:15.099]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:16.500]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.101]  Hammered!
[00:51:18.282 --> 00:51:22.506]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.566 --> 00:51:29.494]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.614 --> 00:51:31.637]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.997 --> 00:51:42.499]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.619 --> 00:51:47.980]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:51.700]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:52.020]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.261 --> 00:51:53.541]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:52:00.982 --> 00:52:08.486]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:08.766 --> 00:52:19.672]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:19.952 --> 00:52:21.755]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.035 --> 00:52:25.339]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:36.134]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:36.434 --> 00:52:36.934]  That's right!
[00:52:37.114 --> 00:52:44.237]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:44.517 --> 00:52:48.639]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[00:53:47.455 --> 00:53:50.537]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.697 --> 00:53:56.560]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:07.842 --> 00:54:14.607]  We got a guest coming up from Las Vegas, where they're going to have these home inspections, whether you like it or not.
[00:54:15.287 --> 00:54:26.895]  But again, that pales in significance to stuff we've seen out of Illinois, where everybody gets a visit, and they come in without a warrant, and you look up from your bed, and there they are standing over you with machine guns.
[00:54:27.496 --> 00:54:30.498]  And they said, well we do this because sometimes it's dangerous coming in the home.
[00:54:31.339 --> 00:54:32.880]  We're just here to inspect your home.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.201]  We have machine guns.
[00:54:36.155 --> 00:54:37.035]  I'm fining you.
[00:54:37.095 --> 00:54:38.396]  You have two toothbrushes.
[00:54:38.456 --> 00:54:41.296]  This apartment is only zoned for one person.
[00:54:41.876 --> 00:54:44.917]  This is prima facie evidence of your crime.
[00:54:46.998 --> 00:54:48.118]  I just can't get over that.
[00:54:49.999 --> 00:54:59.521]  But uh... and then we'll also go to uh... We'll go back to Danny and Tom and Charles and Chad and Eric and
[00:55:00.436 --> 00:55:07.078]  Everybody else that is patiently holding... I do just want to briefly remind folks that I have PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:55:08.019 --> 00:55:13.201]  All of my videos including my new 11th film, American Dictators, are posted there.
[00:55:13.281 --> 00:55:14.461]  George Humphrey's new video.
[00:55:14.481 --> 00:55:18.523]  9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati is posted.
[00:55:18.963 --> 00:55:20.103]  Eric Huffman's video.
[00:55:20.163 --> 00:55:21.344]  Tex Marr's videos.
[00:55:22.064 --> 00:55:24.905]  My weekly reports that are frankly pretty good.
[00:55:26.105 --> 00:55:27.126]  My local TV show.
[00:55:28.126 --> 00:55:29.927]  Of course the best audio interviews I do.
[00:55:30.735 --> 00:55:40.841]  My book, Paul Watson's book, I mean it's a ridiculous amount of material for $0.15 a day if you sign up for a year, $0.19 a day if you sign up for a monthly subscription.
[00:55:41.733 --> 00:55:53.916]  I mean, it's really inexpensive and it supports what we're doing and our huge bandwidth costs and it wouldn't be possible for us to do what we do with the websites, period, with all the free stuff that's on them if some of you weren't out there subscribing.
[00:55:54.376 --> 00:55:58.458]  So you're also kind of subsidizing everybody else that's just now waking up.
[00:55:58.918 --> 00:56:01.298]  So go sign up at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:56:04.597 --> 00:56:32.354]  Today, and if you're not online, or if you want to get, you know, original high-quality videos to make copies of for non-profit educational purposes to get them out to people in your area, all 11 of my films, about 10 other videos I carry about other great authors and researchers, and we got Second Amendment videos, we got videos on the occult, we got videos on 9-11, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, you can order via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[00:56:33.712 --> 00:56:37.615]  Read descriptions of the films, watch clips of them before you order.
[00:56:38.135 --> 00:56:43.439]  You can do that at www.infowars.com or www.prisonplanet.com or you can call toll free 1-888-253-3139 that's 888-253-3139
[00:56:56.881 --> 00:57:04.306]  Or just write to me, I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:57:05.547 --> 00:57:11.651]  We've got that new deal out on the DVDs, and there's also a discount for the VHS version, but none as great.
[00:57:12.312 --> 00:57:13.993]  VHS costs a lot more for us to produce.
[00:57:14.914 --> 00:57:19.497]  Of American Dictators, buy one copy for $19.95, each additional copy is $5.95.
[00:57:21.621 --> 00:57:24.162]  We'll get a bunch of copies and spread them out, folks.
[00:57:24.762 --> 00:57:27.063]  Let's go ahead and go back quickly to Danny in Tennessee.
[00:57:27.603 --> 00:57:30.604]  So, Danny, were you in the first Gulf War and were exposed to DU?
[00:57:32.004 --> 00:57:36.826]  I was over there afterwards in the no-fly zone areas.
[00:57:37.346 --> 00:57:37.866]  Oh, that's right.
[00:57:37.886 --> 00:57:38.707]  You've called before.
[00:57:38.747 --> 00:57:40.947]  You were removing wreckage on the Highway of Death.
[00:57:41.448 --> 00:57:41.688]  Right.
[00:57:42.308 --> 00:57:48.910]  I'd been out in that area and I worked anti-terrorism for about three years and kind of went all over the world.
[00:57:49.602 --> 00:57:55.908]  And I believe I either got it from there or from, there's no telling, I mean it could have been on equipment or anything.
[00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:07.240]  But I just, the VA knew for about a year that I had tumors in my hip and back and kept, I'd go up there and they'd say, oh you're born that way, there's nothing wrong with you.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:12.405]  Then I finally got all my medical records under the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act.
[00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:15.772]  I recommend that to any veteran that has been over there.
[00:58:32.962 --> 00:58:34.243]  Right, they just want us to die.
[00:58:34.963 --> 00:58:40.286]  Yeah, I run my mouth about the New World Order and I'm very vocal about it too, so I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.
[00:58:40.366 --> 00:58:41.327]  Well, they're bureaucrats.
[00:58:41.367 --> 00:58:45.850]  They're soulless, demonic pigs who are going straight to Hades.
[00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:46.370]  Right.
[00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:47.751]  God bless you, Danny.
[00:58:47.811 --> 00:58:48.411]  Good to hear from you.
[00:58:48.431 --> 00:58:48.871]  We'll be back.
[00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:58.550]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:00.290]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.991 --> 00:59:02.091]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.731 --> 00:59:03.591]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.331 --> 00:59:05.211]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.231 --> 00:59:09.532]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.052 --> 00:59:14.193]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.573 --> 00:59:19.274]  Well, this has been a big week for George Bush.
[00:59:19.354 --> 00:59:24.134]  A lot of like-minded people have been endorsing him.
[00:59:24.154 --> 00:59:26.055]  He got Vladimir Putin earlier this week.
[00:59:26.275 --> 00:59:27.235]  Very nice person.
[00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:31.402]  Now the Mullahs have endorsed Bush publicly.
[00:59:31.422 --> 00:59:32.222]  They think he's wonderful.
[00:59:33.542 --> 00:59:35.163]  So, like-minded hooks.
[00:59:36.163 --> 00:59:36.763]  Despots.
[00:59:39.024 --> 00:59:42.304]  And then we got a bunch of news about Israel on the brink of attacking Iran.
[00:59:42.324 --> 00:59:43.245]  I'm going to talk about that later.
[00:59:43.265 --> 00:59:44.405]  Also, home inspections.
[00:59:44.545 --> 00:59:50.826]  They want to inspect your house now, whether it's knock and talk to look for guns, or whether it's a zoning inspection.
[00:59:50.866 --> 00:59:53.807]  They admit it's all about law enforcement and looking for things that are illegal.
[00:59:54.447 --> 00:59:55.528]  What do you have to hide?
[00:59:55.628 --> 00:59:57.408]  Things have changed now here in the homeland.
[00:59:58.061 --> 01:00:00.263]  I know, of course, we also have loaded phone lines.
[01:00:01.184 --> 01:00:03.026]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:00:03.826 --> 01:00:12.154]  We had to leave Chad earlier because he had been pulled over at a checkpoint since he'd been on hold on a highway.
[01:00:12.835 --> 01:00:14.937]  I don't know if Chad's done yet at the checkpoint.
[01:00:15.657 --> 01:00:17.219]  Chad, are you there in Nebraska?
[01:00:17.759 --> 01:00:18.260]  Yes, Doug.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.322]  Can you hear me?
[01:00:20.482 --> 01:00:21.042]  Yes, I can.
[01:00:21.062 --> 01:00:22.804]  Yeah, I'm done.
[01:00:23.889 --> 01:00:25.190]  Okay, what's on your mind, sir?
[01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:27.372]  You've shown your papers, now you're back on the air.
[01:00:27.432 --> 01:00:27.852]  Go ahead.
[01:00:28.613 --> 01:00:36.219]  Yeah, I just wanted to ask you about the whole broadband deal with the shortwave and everything I'm talking about.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:42.684]  They passed a bill last week that they're going to put the broadband and the telephone lines or something.
[01:00:42.704 --> 01:00:45.206]  Yeah, it's data transfer.
[01:00:46.201 --> 01:01:00.082]  Down power lines, instead of using a data line like a telegraph wire or a phone wire or now fiber optic cable, they're going to supercharge information and flow it through the electricity.
[01:01:01.096 --> 01:01:01.537]  That's great!
[01:01:26.553 --> 01:01:34.999]  Well, I think it's going to incrementally come online, and I mean, already... Have you ever been listening to AM radio and you turn your dishwasher on and it blacks it out?
[01:01:35.619 --> 01:01:35.819]  Yes.
[01:01:36.319 --> 01:01:48.968]  I mean, already, different information and radio waves get thrown off of a piece of machinery, a piece of metal, you know, spinning, you know, throws off interference.
[01:01:49.268 --> 01:01:52.530]  It's literally, you know, throwing off particles.
[01:01:55.174 --> 01:01:57.955]  Better than slamming into the antenna and going down the wire.
[01:01:58.035 --> 01:02:03.596]  So, it's not the end of the world, as some have said, but it is going to muddy things up.
[01:02:04.076 --> 01:02:06.236]  It'll muddy up AM radio for you.
[01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:08.617]  You know, it just won't be when the dishwasher's on.
[01:02:08.777 --> 01:02:14.338]  It'll be, you know, all the time if you're close to a power line or as you're driving your car.
[01:02:14.758 --> 01:02:15.979]  Ever listen to AM radio?
[01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:17.739]  You drive under a power line and it cuts out?
[01:02:18.639 --> 01:02:19.979]  Yeah, I listen to it all the time.
[01:02:20.039 --> 01:02:20.660]  I'm a truck driver.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.880]  I listen to it all night long.
[01:02:22.893 --> 01:02:26.877]  It cuts out all the time, and I'm always trying to get signals, you know, everywhere.
[01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:29.760]  But see, that's been happening forever.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:30.440]  Yeah.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.643]  Because already that electricity is throwing off radio waves.
[01:02:34.604 --> 01:02:34.945]  Okay?
[01:02:35.205 --> 01:02:44.694]  But now it's going to be, they say, hundreds of times worse, because when they actually send data down it, that's going to pollute, they call it signal pollution.
[01:02:45.485 --> 01:02:46.765]  And it's going to be all over the place.
[01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:48.066]  I mean, I'm not an expert on it.
[01:02:48.126 --> 01:02:49.366]  I've read what the experts are saying.
[01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:54.948]  The big official AM radio organization says it's bad.
[01:02:54.988 --> 01:02:56.988]  The shortwave organizations say it's bad.
[01:02:57.888 --> 01:02:58.909]  FEMA doesn't like it.
[01:03:00.749 --> 01:03:05.130]  It's going to screw up their communications, their sideband.
[01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:07.411]  They're saying submarines might have problems.
[01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:12.672]  But there's so much money in it for industry that the Congress says we don't care.
[01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:44.721]  Well it seems like with the internet too and you know the public access TV trying to shut that down and now this you know it's almost like that there's just been such a awakening that you know if it was all this happening you know far apart from each other hearing about it I probably wouldn't think it was because of that but it's just kind of funny that that there's yeah just I know myself I got a burner and I've been handing out your videos that just out you know I go all across the country you know and
[01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:46.766]  I have them out all across the 48.
[01:03:47.787 --> 01:03:50.029]  Well, I want you to keep it up and thanks for the call.
[01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.770]  We'll be back.
[01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:52.952]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.452 --> 01:03:59.737]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[01:04:00.098 --> 01:04:04.201]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[01:04:04.702 --> 01:04:11.908]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:19.816]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:22.398]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[01:04:22.719 --> 01:04:25.982]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[01:04:26.382 --> 01:04:29.525]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[01:04:29.846 --> 01:04:32.749]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[01:04:33.229 --> 01:04:38.333]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match.
[01:04:38.493 --> 01:04:41.395]  Because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[01:04:41.815 --> 01:04:43.336]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings.
[01:04:43.376 --> 01:04:45.298]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com
[01:04:53.363 --> 01:04:56.644]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.704 --> 01:05:00.885]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:01.125 --> 01:05:03.926]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:04.106 --> 01:05:06.507]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.687 --> 01:05:15.349]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:15.529 --> 01:05:16.890]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:21.271]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:21.551 --> 01:05:21.871]  I think so.
[01:05:52.892 --> 01:05:59.737]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:01.438]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:06:01.618 --> 01:06:03.840]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.081]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:11.285]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:06:11.625 --> 01:06:15.648]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:06:15.908 --> 01:06:17.670]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:28.402]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:06:28.562 --> 01:06:30.425]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:06:30.885 --> 01:06:34.507]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the InfoWars.
[01:06:34.607 --> 01:06:36.048]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:40.211]  Big Brother.
[01:06:40.251 --> 01:06:41.331]  Mainstream Media.
[01:07:01.102 --> 01:07:02.183]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.843 --> 01:07:03.704]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.424 --> 01:07:05.285]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:09.767]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.188 --> 01:07:14.310]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.511 --> 01:07:22.635]  That's right, my friends, now 8 minutes and 25 seconds into this second hour of this Thursday edition, 21st of October,
[01:07:24.787 --> 01:07:27.309]  It's about ten and a half days out from the election.
[01:07:27.369 --> 01:07:31.191]  Police State Candidate 1 against Police State Candidate 2.
[01:07:31.972 --> 01:07:37.956]  Both of them love the new Super Patriot Act that's been passed out of the House and Senate, now in Conference Committee.
[01:07:37.976 --> 01:07:41.418]  They love the National ID Card that's in that legislation.
[01:07:42.899 --> 01:07:53.586]  And I rarely have a memory failure on key issues like this, but today, and it's just driving me crazy, I know we have a lot of listeners in Illinois.
[01:07:55.686 --> 01:07:57.027]  And some great affiliates up there.
[01:07:58.207 --> 01:08:06.850]  Can you please call in and remind me, it was two and a half, three years ago, I had guests on, I had city officials on, I had newspaper reporters on.
[01:08:09.291 --> 01:08:15.734]  It described, it was all from the Chicago Tribune, but it wasn't Chicago, it was like Queensville, Maryville, something-ville.
[01:08:16.454 --> 01:08:20.476]  Because it integrates with this KLAS-TV news report about
[01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:23.513]  North Las Vegas, but it's far worse than this.
[01:08:23.813 --> 01:08:24.594]  This is bad.
[01:08:24.854 --> 01:08:27.136]  And our guest is valiantly fighting it.
[01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:29.099]  But it's just driving me crazy.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.722]  I covered it over and over again for like a week.
[01:08:32.762 --> 01:08:33.443]  It was so incredible.
[01:08:33.783 --> 01:08:38.248]  It described old ladies waking up with police with guns, searching their house.
[01:08:38.288 --> 01:08:44.715]  And if they had more toothbrushes than what the house was zoned for, even if people weren't there, they'd find them on the spot.
[01:08:45.498 --> 01:08:46.759]  And they came in without warrants.
[01:08:47.059 --> 01:08:52.344]  It was far worse than what's happening, but I guarantee you this is what it'll grow into in Las Vegas.
[01:08:54.345 --> 01:08:55.867]  And we've seen many other reports of this.
[01:08:55.907 --> 01:08:59.670]  We have the knock and talk in Arizona and Dallas, Texas.
[01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:02.793]  All over the place where, mind if I come in and look at your guns?
[01:09:02.893 --> 01:09:03.713]  Well, why?
[01:09:03.733 --> 01:09:05.735]  It's just a neighborhood service we do now.
[01:09:06.496 --> 01:09:08.678]  Total violation of the 4th and 5th Amendment.
[01:09:09.658 --> 01:09:12.461]  But now it's coming to a big town like Las Vegas.
[01:09:12.561 --> 01:09:13.822]  North Las Vegas proposes
[01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:15.791]  Rental Enforcement Plan.
[01:09:15.831 --> 01:09:19.233]  Now, at this time it's just rental houses and apartments and things.
[01:09:19.853 --> 01:09:25.775]  They say it's for safety, but they admit in the article that they're also going to be looking for criminal activities.
[01:09:26.835 --> 01:09:28.536]  Well, what have you got to hide?
[01:09:29.336 --> 01:09:30.836]  Well, that's what they said in Nazi Germany.
[01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:34.338]  How about I come search your house, police?
[01:09:34.478 --> 01:09:35.278]  You wouldn't like that.
[01:09:35.918 --> 01:09:37.298]  A man's home is his castle.
[01:09:38.239 --> 01:09:41.820]  Look, feudal serfs, 500 years ago in England,
[01:09:43.132 --> 01:09:45.034]  Had absolutely no rights but one.
[01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:49.797]  No one could come in their Hubble with holes in the roof.
[01:09:51.259 --> 01:09:55.762]  No one, without a warrant, specifically saying why.
[01:09:57.003 --> 01:10:03.068]  Thanks for sitting there while I babbled over that background, Alan Lichtenstein.
[01:10:03.715 --> 01:10:05.336]  He's with the ACLU.
[01:10:05.356 --> 01:10:08.017]  ACLU getting a little radical now.
[01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.458]  You've got Bob Barr working with them.
[01:10:09.878 --> 01:10:13.019]  Actually standing up for the Bill of Rights.
[01:10:13.919 --> 01:10:15.220]  Allen, good to have you on with us.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.380]  Well, thank you for having me.
[01:10:17.841 --> 01:10:19.822]  This is pretty scary what's going on.
[01:10:19.942 --> 01:10:24.684]  It's not just a new tax, but it's also kind of a Gestapo situation.
[01:10:24.704 --> 01:10:25.905]  What's going on in Las Vegas?
[01:10:26.285 --> 01:10:27.825]  Well, this is actually in North Las Vegas.
[01:10:28.346 --> 01:10:31.467]  There's a proposal that has not been enacted yet, and hopefully it won't be enacted.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:50.380]  That allows inspectors to go into rental housing to inspect sensibly for safety reasons, but the proposal is broad enough so that they're pretty much unlimited in what they can look around for and do once they're in there, which is obviously frightening.
[01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:53.751]  Now, there's several articles on this.
[01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:57.934]  I get from the stories that it's also so broad that, quote, they can bring police if they want.
[01:10:58.275 --> 01:11:04.119]  So really, this is going to be like a rubber stamp to not have warrants and just force their way into homes.
[01:11:04.419 --> 01:11:07.422]  Well, the Supreme Court said you have to have a warrant.
[01:11:07.442 --> 01:11:08.182]  This is back in 1967.
[01:11:08.262 --> 01:11:12.085]  They said that you can go into rental housing if you're in government.
[01:11:12.846 --> 01:11:13.887]  But you have to have a warrant.
[01:11:14.767 --> 01:11:20.992]  The way this thing is written, however, it makes it appear that the landlord
[01:11:21.828 --> 01:11:22.229]  I don't know.
[01:11:22.249 --> 01:11:22.629]  I don't know.
[01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:59.734]  Living in their house, minding their own business, can have the government rummaging through their stuff while they're away without them even knowing about it.
[01:12:00.715 --> 01:12:02.696]  And that is pretty scary.
[01:12:03.456 --> 01:12:13.260]  One other provision, which makes it even stranger, is that it is illegal under this to have an unclean or unsanitary house.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:19.282]  So you have the government now coming in and citing people, and I guess there's even jail time attached to it,
[01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:23.932]  For having dirty dishes, not taking out the garbage, being a messy housekeeper.
[01:12:24.912 --> 01:12:28.913]  That really does sort of smack a big brother in a rather significant way.
[01:12:29.934 --> 01:12:32.995]  Now you just dropped a bombshell on us there.
[01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:40.097]  Now again, ladies and gentlemen, they'll already, if you're in Head Start, send three CPS visits a year to your home.
[01:12:40.638 --> 01:12:43.779]  And if they have dirty dishes when they happen to show up, they'll take their children.
[01:12:43.799 --> 01:12:46.740]  I mean that's been cited thousands of times that I've seen in the newspapers.
[01:12:49.261 --> 01:12:55.365]  And so I guess now you... What does the provision, Alan, specifically say?
[01:12:55.926 --> 01:12:57.787]  That having a dirty house is illegal?
[01:12:57.867 --> 01:13:04.332]  Well, it says that the tenant has to keep their house clean and sanitary.
[01:13:04.912 --> 01:13:09.916]  And another provision says that any violation of any part of that code has certain penalties.
[01:13:10.076 --> 01:13:16.200]  So it applies to the clean and sanitary housekeeper as well.
[01:13:17.141 --> 01:13:17.541]  Wow!
[01:13:17.621 --> 01:13:17.901]  This is...
[01:13:19.947 --> 01:13:23.308]  Even the case in Illinois I saw that dwarfed this in some respects.
[01:13:24.248 --> 01:13:27.429]  It does not surpass the Orwellian nature of what you just said.
[01:13:27.449 --> 01:13:29.690]  It is pretty surprising.
[01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:35.992]  We looked at it, tried to find any other case that went that far, and so far we've not been able to find any.
[01:13:36.903 --> 01:13:49.028]  And I'm reading here from the TV station's news release about this and they say in here that they're also allowed to be looking for other things that are illegal and that they're going to be there to report it to police.
[01:13:49.308 --> 01:13:53.750]  So they're up front saying we're informants and you have to let us in your house.
[01:13:54.370 --> 01:14:02.794]  Yeah, well, actually the proposal says that they have to report any activity, anything that they find that's illegal to appropriate other agencies.
[01:14:03.636 --> 01:14:12.860]  And of course they're not really... The police here have been quite open about the fact that they do work with the health inspectors.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:19.183]  So you have a situation where police cannot get a criminal warrant because they don't have a probable cause.
[01:14:20.604 --> 01:14:30.708]  They can have the health inspectors, or actually even in the proposal there's nothing to prohibit the health inspectors from going in with police and rummaging through someone's house without
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:40.328]  Any specificity whatsoever and going on that kind of fishing expedition without the normal requirements for a criminal warrant.
[01:14:40.428 --> 01:14:41.550]  A big step in the wrong direction.
[01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:49.916]  Well, I don't know if they'll have less rights than a feudal serf in England.
[01:15:07.958 --> 01:15:11.961]  People in England had no Bill of Rights to fight any of these things with.
[01:15:12.101 --> 01:15:18.925]  Well, I mean, on the home front, though, they did have more rights, if this passes, concerning their homes.
[01:15:20.566 --> 01:15:24.089]  Well, again, I'm hoping this won't pass.
[01:15:24.129 --> 01:15:25.870]  This has been proposed.
[01:15:27.471 --> 01:15:34.456]  It has several provisions that we've talked about that are really quite scary, but a lot of people have
[01:15:35.566 --> 01:15:37.047]  Do you know about the Illinois town?
[01:15:37.067 --> 01:15:38.168]  I'm trying to remember the name.
[01:15:57.424 --> 01:15:57.844]  We're good to go.
[01:16:20.362 --> 01:16:43.586]  She had said on her city taxes or whatever it was one person and it was one person but the two toothbrushes was prima facie evidence and then another family woke up with cops with guns at four in the morning at the head of their bed walking around like they and they said what why are you here and they said they wouldn't even talk to them they went right in to check the toothbrushes I mean again when I say that I feel like I'm
[01:16:44.355 --> 01:16:45.756]  This is a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:16:45.776 --> 01:16:50.441]  I feel like I'm lying, but I remember it was in the news, and the newspaper was quite proud of this.
[01:16:50.461 --> 01:16:59.829]  I know that the ACLU in that area was involved in fighting that, and you probably have more details than I do about that particular case.
[01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:00.530]  Well, I can't remember.
[01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:01.671]  That's why I'm going crazy here.
[01:17:03.192 --> 01:17:05.795]  But this is a trend that is happening all over the country.
[01:17:06.651 --> 01:17:17.684]  Um, for government to be more and more intrusive, and we do have a Bill of Rights to allow us to fight against those particular governmental tendencies, and that's what we're doing.
[01:17:17.944 --> 01:17:21.569]  Let me ask you a question, Alan Lichtenstein, with the ACLU.
[01:17:21.789 --> 01:17:25.233]  We'll give out the Las Vegas ACLU website here in a second.
[01:17:26.577 --> 01:17:28.319]  I mean, you deal with government all the time.
[01:17:28.659 --> 01:17:30.200]  What's happened to their brains?
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:36.184]  I mean, how far have they gone that they start proposing stuff and implementing stuff this out of control?
[01:17:37.545 --> 01:17:51.636]  Well, again, I don't analyze anyone's brain, but a long time ago someone said to me, if government didn't have the tendency to violate people's rights and to try to get more and more power, we wouldn't have needed a Bill of Rights.
[01:17:51.996 --> 01:17:55.599]  And the founders of the Constitution were smart enough to realize that
[01:17:57.008 --> 01:18:03.391]  That is the tendency of government, and for us to be successful, we do need to have something that protects individual rights and the Constitution.
[01:18:04.031 --> 01:18:06.972]  And so, this is a constant struggle and a constant battle.
[01:18:07.733 --> 01:18:13.995]  And I imagine as long as we're in existence as a nation, we're going to be having this particular type of fight tomorrow.
[01:18:14.475 --> 01:18:15.876]  Well, I have to be honest with you.
[01:18:15.976 --> 01:18:19.938]  I mean, people are waking up in droves, but it seems like we're losing these fights.
[01:18:19.958 --> 01:18:23.099]  I mean, I'm sure you know about the new National ID Card Bill.
[01:18:24.039 --> 01:18:27.441]  And that baby is passed to conference.
[01:18:28.202 --> 01:18:29.683]  I mean, it's just nuts.
[01:18:29.823 --> 01:18:39.569]  I believe that the government will impinge upon the rights of citizens to the extent that citizens allow them to.
[01:18:39.589 --> 01:18:42.711]  Well, I'll tell you what, can you do one more quick segment with us?
[01:18:42.931 --> 01:18:43.271]  Sure.
[01:18:43.491 --> 01:18:44.932]  Alright, we've got to go to break.
[01:18:44.952 --> 01:18:48.434]  We'll be right back with Alan for five more minutes and then we're going to go to your calls.
[01:18:49.074 --> 01:18:49.835]  So stay with us.
[01:18:50.035 --> 01:18:51.256]  See, he knows about Illinois.
[01:18:54.426 --> 01:18:57.430]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:18:57.790 --> 01:19:06.620]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:11.606]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:19:12.066 --> 01:19:18.789]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:30.975]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:31.435 --> 01:19:35.898]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:19:36.078 --> 01:19:38.540]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:19:53.251 --> 01:19:56.274]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:19:56.654 --> 01:19:59.176]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[01:19:59.396 --> 01:20:06.463]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:20:06.663 --> 01:20:09.966]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:12.228]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:20:12.568 --> 01:20:20.395]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering the lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:20:20.655 --> 01:20:21.936]  Either way, why chance it?

[01:22:00.945 --> 01:22:05.487]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:22:05.607 --> 01:22:12.430]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:18.932]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:19.073 --> 01:22:20.293]  There are no side effects.
[01:22:20.633 --> 01:22:23.576]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:22:23.736 --> 01:22:25.758]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:22:26.059 --> 01:22:33.306]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:22:33.606 --> 01:22:36.970]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:22:37.410 --> 01:22:45.615]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 one more time that's 866-885-6625 call today I was talking to Alan Lichtenstein, he's the general counsel, their counselor
[01:23:08.112 --> 01:23:10.474]  There for the ACLU in Las Vegas.
[01:23:10.494 --> 01:23:11.395]  We're honored to have him.
[01:23:12.516 --> 01:23:15.178]  And I was saying, can you find me that Illinois case?
[01:23:15.238 --> 01:23:18.281]  Because, again, I'm on the hunt for the name of this town.
[01:23:18.841 --> 01:23:26.868]  And he was aware of it, but then when he found an instance of it there, it was another ACLU situation in New Jersey!
[01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:34.215]  Uh, where they come to inspect how many people live there and just show up and you gotta let us in or they just break in without a warrant.
[01:23:34.736 --> 01:23:36.637]  And when you ask them, what are you doing here?
[01:23:36.698 --> 01:23:38.179]  They just say, we're just doing an inspection.
[01:23:38.897 --> 01:23:45.662]  But he's talking about Las Vegas where they're going to criminally charge you for dirty dishes, not carrying out the trash.
[01:23:46.303 --> 01:23:50.686]  They admit that by law they have to spy on you and report back.
[01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:54.969]  And Alan there in the break brought up a good point to me that it's all color of law.
[01:23:55.409 --> 01:23:58.612]  They say they don't need a warrant, but they truly do.
[01:23:59.112 --> 01:24:00.853]  And it's up to us to enforce that.
[01:24:01.454 --> 01:24:03.115]  Alan, can you tell folks about that court case?
[01:24:03.475 --> 01:24:05.497]  Yeah, it was a case, a U.S.
[01:24:05.517 --> 01:24:06.317]  Supreme Court case in 1967.
[01:24:08.378 --> 01:24:20.942]  Where the Supreme Court said very clearly that before a government can enter a housing unit, even a rental unit, they either have to be invited in, or they have to go get a warrant.
[01:24:20.962 --> 01:24:27.783]  Now the warrant may not have the same stringent requirements for a criminal warrant, but they still have to get a judge to issue a warrant.
[01:24:28.184 --> 01:24:36.966]  So what generally happens, and one of the concerns we have about this proposal on North Las Vegas, is it is written in a way that makes it seem
[01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:44.102]  To someone who's not familiar with the law, that just a notice of intent to come in is enough.
[01:24:44.803 --> 01:24:49.547]  And that someone does not have a choice in saying, no, I'm not going to let you in, go get a warrant.
[01:24:50.467 --> 01:24:58.554]  And one of the things that is necessary for these kinds of things to be curtailed is for the public to be informed of their rights.
[01:24:59.215 --> 01:25:00.816]  And your rights are that without a warrant,
[01:25:01.674 --> 01:25:05.536]  Uh, police or inspectors cannot come into your house, generally.
[01:25:05.896 --> 01:25:12.540]  And again, it's in the Las Vegas proposal that they don't even need to notify you, so you don't even know that they were ever there.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:17.823]  Right, they could notify the landlord because the landlord has the authority to voluntarily let you in.
[01:25:18.673 --> 01:25:29.324]  And the way it's written, it sort of indicates to the landlord, it says very clearly, the landlord must ensure that they are allowed into the apartment, which is clearly contrary to the law.
[01:25:29.364 --> 01:25:32.787]  Well, this brings up another case of the unreasonable search and seizure.
[01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:37.592]  This new No Child Left Behind proposal allows, well it passed,
[01:25:38.292 --> 01:25:46.317]  Uh, allows the military to have the names, the numbers, the test scores, all the background on all the students in public schools that take this federal money.
[01:25:46.897 --> 01:25:56.962]  But there's a provision that you've got to be given the right to refuse, you've got to be notified, but in the last couple years since they passed this, they don't notify, they just go ahead and grab all the data.
[01:25:57.422 --> 01:25:59.824]  So again, government is breaking the law here every day.
[01:26:01.044 --> 01:26:01.505]  Uh, yeah.
[01:26:01.605 --> 01:26:05.407]  What they tend to do is make it seem that
[01:26:07.293 --> 01:26:17.095]  What is really a voluntary situation is involuntary, and you have to do it so people will, again, allow officials to come into their house thinking that they have no choice.
[01:26:17.795 --> 01:26:21.215]  And then once they allow them in, the court says, well, it's voluntary.
[01:26:21.716 --> 01:26:25.556]  But voluntary really has to mean truly with informed consent.
[01:26:26.116 --> 01:26:34.158]  And if someone doesn't know that they're allowed and have the right to refuse, then there's nothing really voluntary about it.
[01:26:34.358 --> 01:26:35.978]  And that's one of the concerns that's happening.
[01:26:36.582 --> 01:26:40.748]  Again, in North Las Vegas, and as you mentioned, in so many other types of situations.
[01:26:41.490 --> 01:26:42.892]  Is this going to be defeated?
[01:26:42.932 --> 01:26:45.596]  I mean, I would imagine that the public is against this proposal.
[01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:50.432]  I think that the public has not really been informed about this proposal.
[01:26:50.512 --> 01:26:58.819]  The article that you mentioned and the TV program that have come out have informed people and I think that there is a growing movement to get this defeated.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:08.926]  I should point out also one of the other concerns is that there's an exemption in this for rental units built with for 10 years.
[01:27:09.447 --> 01:27:12.149]  So it really is targeting people in poorer parts of town.
[01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:14.875]  Not really interested in the new luxury apartments.
[01:27:14.935 --> 01:27:21.330]  They're going after those who are in the older, poorer parts of town, which also brings up an equal protection argument.
[01:27:22.435 --> 01:27:29.179]  It certainly does, and they always target the weaker members of society first in any predatory governmental move.
[01:27:29.239 --> 01:27:37.685]  Alan Lichtenstein, Chief Counsel there for the ACLU in Las Vegas, I'd imagine you guys are pretty busy there with all the stuff going on in Sin City.
[01:27:38.225 --> 01:27:43.849]  Well, there's always a lot to do in dealing with government abuse.
[01:27:44.109 --> 01:27:46.391]  What's the ACLU website for Las Vegas?
[01:27:47.571 --> 01:27:48.592]  That's a good question.
[01:27:51.151 --> 01:27:53.574]  No, I understand.
[01:27:53.594 --> 01:27:59.679]  If folks want to visit their website, which I'm sure has some postings concerning this, just type in ACLU of Las Vegas.
[01:27:59.879 --> 01:28:00.820]  I'm from Nevada.
[01:28:01.601 --> 01:28:02.662]  ACLU of Nevada, actually.
[01:28:02.682 --> 01:28:03.683]  Oh, so you're for the whole state.
[01:28:03.803 --> 01:28:04.924]  Yeah.
[01:28:05.184 --> 01:28:08.147]  Just type in ACLU of Nevada and that should get you to the website.
[01:28:08.267 --> 01:28:10.229]  And you can also look at the national ACLU site.
[01:28:10.249 --> 01:28:15.574]  It has a lot of this information and a lot of information about what's going on all over the country, not just in one particular locale.
[01:28:16.127 --> 01:28:16.547]  All right.
[01:28:16.627 --> 01:28:27.993]  Well, again, you can also go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and read the different news articles and TV pieces that are posted there on the sites concerning this.
[01:28:29.314 --> 01:28:31.035]  Allen Lichtenstein, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:28:31.275 --> 01:28:32.396]  Well, thank you very much for having me.
[01:28:32.576 --> 01:28:32.996]  Take care.
[01:28:34.177 --> 01:28:38.019]  Well, I mean, I get the guy on and it turns out to be even worse than what the newspaper says.
[01:28:38.099 --> 01:28:39.540]  Surprise, surprise!
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:40.820]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:41.461]  PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:30:53.371 --> 01:30:56.433]  Dad, that cocoon stuff really got rid of your gray hair!
[01:30:56.613 --> 01:31:03.137]  I'm that 44 year old guy you've heard talking about taking Cocoon GH and how it helped reverse my gray hairs.
[01:31:03.237 --> 01:31:05.058]  And here's some more great news.
[01:31:05.158 --> 01:31:08.660]  Taking Cocoon GH can improve your life in many ways.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:14.163]  Cocoon basically repairs your body to a youthful state you perhaps had 10 or 20 years ago.
[01:31:14.384 --> 01:31:16.945]  I'm taking Cocoon GH and here's what I notice.
[01:31:17.105 --> 01:31:21.988]  After a few sprays in my mouth, I'm in peak condition mentally, emotionally, and physically.
[01:31:21.988 --> 01:31:22.708]  We're good to go!
[01:31:43.319 --> 01:31:43.399]  800-814-5031.
[01:31:43.419 --> 01:31:43.459]  800-814-5031.
[01:31:43.479 --> 01:31:43.559]  800-814-5031.
[01:31:43.579 --> 01:31:44.260]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:45.821]  Let's go straight to your calls.
[01:31:45.841 --> 01:31:46.401]  Thanks for holding.
[01:32:14.718 --> 01:32:18.442]  Let us go ahead and talk to Tom in Illinois.
[01:32:19.343 --> 01:32:20.224]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:32:20.264 --> 01:32:20.584]  Welcome.
[01:32:21.025 --> 01:32:21.745]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:32:21.805 --> 01:32:22.026]  Good.
[01:32:22.046 --> 01:32:22.946]  Great to talk to you.
[01:32:24.148 --> 01:32:26.810]  Always a great show listening to you on the web here in Chicago.
[01:32:27.871 --> 01:32:31.715]  I don't know if you're aware of this, but I had a girlfriend of mine call me the other day.
[01:32:31.735 --> 01:32:33.837]  Are you familiar with the show, The View?
[01:32:34.337 --> 01:32:38.862]  You know, with Barbara Walters and Star Jones, whatever.
[01:32:39.616 --> 01:32:40.497]  It's pretty interesting to hear.
[01:32:40.537 --> 01:32:41.917]  She actually held the phone up for me.
[01:32:42.097 --> 01:32:47.661]  They spent some time talking about how Kerry and Bush are cousins and being blood related.
[01:32:47.801 --> 01:32:52.323]  So I don't know if anybody got you to pay for that, but it's pretty interesting to hear them talk about it.
[01:32:53.404 --> 01:32:54.845]  No, that's sensational.
[01:32:55.925 --> 01:33:02.109]  Why do you think the Bilderberg group comes out in the New York Times and says, we told Kerry to appoint Edwards, we're the boss.
[01:33:02.829 --> 01:33:05.371]  Then Kerry goes on TV and bows to them and says yes.
[01:33:06.064 --> 01:33:06.924]  They are the ones.
[01:33:06.944 --> 01:33:09.785]  I mean, he literally said, they gave me the call, that's why I chose him.
[01:33:10.605 --> 01:33:12.406]  Larry, I respect them.
[01:33:13.486 --> 01:33:18.388]  And then we've got them admitting world government, admitting they're part of a satanic secret society.
[01:33:18.748 --> 01:33:21.148]  Well, satanism's just for fun, Tom.
[01:33:21.168 --> 01:33:24.569]  I mean, why do you think they're just throwing all this in our face now?
[01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:26.430]  Yeah.
[01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:33.472]  I mean, they were actually joking about, you know, saying, if the candidates, you know, if they're even aware of this, maybe we shouldn't, you know,
[01:33:34.437 --> 01:33:35.858]  You know, now we're letting the cat out of the bag.
[01:33:35.878 --> 01:33:38.961]  Let's, you know, maybe we should give them a call and let them know that they're related.
[01:33:39.001 --> 01:33:42.565]  You know, it's kind of funny they were, you know, joking about that.
[01:33:43.185 --> 01:33:46.128]  Well, you know, on MSNBC they've got a family chart.
[01:33:46.989 --> 01:33:52.150]  But that chart is only for one side of their family related to the other side.
[01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:54.571]  People have four sides of their family.
[01:33:54.591 --> 01:33:59.272]  Well, when you have two individuals, there's your mommy, your daddy's side, and the other side there's your daddy and your mommy's side.
[01:33:59.912 --> 01:34:03.753]  And they are at least related on three sides of their family.
[01:34:03.813 --> 01:34:05.973]  Some of the genealogy charts show four sides.
[01:34:06.413 --> 01:34:07.814]  So they're all intermarried.
[01:34:07.834 --> 01:34:09.134]  And then you've got Dick Cheney,
[01:34:10.269 --> 01:34:31.154]  Uh, who, you know, flunked out of Yale, and there's a bunch of Cheneys in Skull and Bones, he admittedly was going to be in it, his relatives were in it, but he flunked out, this is admitted, folks, flunked out of Yale twice, and then it turns out, uh, Reuters just came out, what, two weeks ago, I didn't know this, Dick Cheney's related to Bush and Kerry!
[01:34:31.434 --> 01:34:32.974]  Ha ha ha, I mean, ha ha ha!
[01:34:33.134 --> 01:34:34.755]  Nothing to worry about, just a coincidence.
[01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:37.311]  I'm sorry, go ahead, what were you saying?
[01:34:37.511 --> 01:34:39.792]  No, I said nothing to worry about, just a coincidence.
[01:34:40.493 --> 01:34:43.355]  Well, yeah, and then they say, well, everybody's related.
[01:34:43.435 --> 01:34:45.136]  Well, no, that's not true, folks.
[01:34:45.576 --> 01:34:51.580]  You're not, you know, 3rd and 9th and 14th cousins with everybody.
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:56.683]  It's very, very rare, but they're all from the blue blood elitist
[01:34:57.564 --> 01:35:01.266]  Uh, that have been running this country, and they all intermarry to keep their money.
[01:35:01.306 --> 01:35:01.726]  Look, look!
[01:35:02.106 --> 01:35:03.307]  Teresa Hines Carey.
[01:35:03.767 --> 01:35:05.127]  You know who her ex-husband was?
[01:35:05.588 --> 01:35:06.148]  Yep, yep.
[01:35:06.488 --> 01:35:09.349]  Well, Mr. Hines was one of the top Skull & Bones members.
[01:35:10.190 --> 01:35:11.830]  And when he died, he left her all the money.
[01:35:12.451 --> 01:35:16.632]  And the only other people who know about Skull & Bones are the wives of Skull & Bones members.
[01:35:17.113 --> 01:35:19.974]  They admittedly have a weird ritual they do at the wedding.
[01:35:20.737 --> 01:35:29.302]  And the first party Bush had after he was elected, after the big ball, once he moved in, was a Skull & Bones reunion at the White House.
[01:35:30.242 --> 01:35:44.530]  So, I mean, we've got Kerry's wife is Skull & Bones, he's Skull & Bones, Bush is Skull & Bones, Dick Cheney was going to be tapped for it, but was such an alcoholic, this is admitted, that he flunked out twice,
[01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:54.533]  And there's a bunch of Chinese who are his grandfather's, his uncle's, their whole skull and bones!
[01:35:54.593 --> 01:35:55.394]  It's a joke!
[01:35:55.774 --> 01:35:56.474]  It's unbelievable.
[01:35:57.394 --> 01:35:58.395]  Yeah.
[01:35:58.455 --> 01:35:59.635]  One more quick thing.
[01:35:59.655 --> 01:36:03.097]  I know you've got a lot of other callers on the line, but I ordered American Dictators.
[01:36:03.117 --> 01:36:09.779]  You might want to tell the web guys on the main banner link for American Dictators the phone number is actually incorrect.
[01:36:09.839 --> 01:36:10.699]  So you might want to fix that.
[01:36:12.901 --> 01:36:14.181]  You know, we might want to do that.
[01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:20.884]  I think it says 2129 and I remember just from listening to the show every day, 3139.
[01:36:22.024 --> 01:36:22.804]  You know what happens?
[01:36:22.884 --> 01:36:25.745]  I sit there, tell my webmaster, get it up, get it up, get it up!
[01:36:26.265 --> 01:36:27.486]  And then they make mistakes.
[01:36:27.566 --> 01:36:29.907]  Thank you so much for that information.
[01:36:30.267 --> 01:36:31.867]  I just wanted to give you a little heads up on that.
[01:36:32.267 --> 01:36:36.249]  Now, is that on the information page about the film?
[01:36:37.149 --> 01:36:39.730]  It's actually on the, if you go to InfoWars,
[01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:42.493]  ...on the top banner.
[01:36:42.513 --> 01:36:44.013]  I know it's correct everywhere else.
[01:36:44.454 --> 01:36:54.158]  It's just when you click the banner at the top for it, and then you scroll down to the bottom, and then it gives the toll-free number at the bottom.
[01:36:54.238 --> 01:37:01.321]  I'm not sure exactly... I know it's correct in some other places.
[01:37:01.561 --> 01:37:04.882]  So you're saying the data page about the film has it wrong?
[01:37:05.303 --> 01:37:05.583]  Yeah.
[01:37:05.823 --> 01:37:08.164]  Well, I bet some poor soul's getting some phone calls.
[01:37:08.869 --> 01:37:10.210]  I hope that's just a dead number.
[01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:11.771]  Yeah, it is a dead number.
[01:37:11.791 --> 01:37:12.871]  It seems to be a dead number.
[01:37:13.151 --> 01:37:14.612]  Okay, well I'll get it fixed.
[01:37:14.652 --> 01:37:14.932]  Thank you.
[01:37:14.952 --> 01:37:16.673]  Yeah, just a little heads up there.
[01:37:16.693 --> 01:37:17.213]  Thank you, Tom.
[01:37:17.233 --> 01:37:17.694]  Thanks a lot.
[01:37:18.274 --> 01:37:18.874]  Love the show.
[01:37:19.234 --> 01:37:20.135]  Appreciate everything you're doing.
[01:37:20.495 --> 01:37:21.335]  You're awesome, Tom.
[01:37:21.375 --> 01:37:21.836]  Thank you.
[01:37:23.116 --> 01:37:26.938]  Let's go ahead and go to Charles in California.
[01:37:27.539 --> 01:37:28.599]  Charles, you're on the air.
[01:37:28.639 --> 01:37:28.979]  Welcome.
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:29.520]  Hi.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:30.020]  Hello.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.821]  It's been a long time since I talked to you.
[01:37:33.282 --> 01:37:35.823]  Speaking of what you were talking about with the last caller,
[01:37:36.809 --> 01:37:56.813]  I was listening to Amy Goodman's show yesterday and they were talking about what a big Christian Bush is and how he has prayer meetings all the time and all these evangelists come there and it's just one big Christian outing there in the White House now according to what the article was saying on that show.
[01:37:57.213 --> 01:38:00.214]  Now let me break down the sophisticated propaganda.
[01:38:01.214 --> 01:38:06.395]  You know they have the cover of Time Magazine with an image of the Oval Office desk and chair
[01:38:07.333 --> 01:38:13.735]  And, you know, the Seal, the President, and then there's this heavenly light shining down, and they go, how terrifying!
[01:38:14.295 --> 01:38:21.597]  George Bush believes he's anointed of God, and we've got Ashcroft anointing people with oil and speaking in tongues.
[01:38:21.637 --> 01:38:22.538]  They're crazy!
[01:38:22.998 --> 01:38:24.438]  They're crazy Christians!
[01:38:24.458 --> 01:38:26.319]  That's what they were saying, basically.
[01:38:26.559 --> 01:38:29.720]  This is horrible, but this is the reality, folks.
[01:38:31.098 --> 01:38:40.901]  They know, Time Magazine knows, this is all psychological warfare, that that makes good Christians, who are good people, watch that and go, well then George Bush must be good.
[01:38:41.401 --> 01:38:44.002]  Look at these evil, reprobate liberals.
[01:38:44.582 --> 01:38:47.903]  They're against George Bush, who is this devout Christian.
[01:38:47.943 --> 01:38:48.964]  We better defend him.
[01:38:49.344 --> 01:38:51.704]  It's the fake left-right paradigm that they play on us.
[01:38:51.764 --> 01:38:55.306]  You know, this Coke vs. Pepsi, Ford vs. Chevy.
[01:38:55.806 --> 01:38:56.766]  It's totally staged.
[01:38:57.726 --> 01:39:03.873]  And meanwhile, folks, George Bush is a member of a satanic society, so is Kerry.
[01:39:04.153 --> 01:39:05.735]  They're members of Bohemian Grove.
[01:39:05.775 --> 01:39:13.904]  They openly, it's been caught on video now, not just by myself, but by the New York Observer, do incantations to the devil.
[01:39:14.997 --> 01:39:19.499]  You know, death equals death, devil equals devil, devil, you know?
[01:39:19.599 --> 01:39:22.640]  I don't even want to say the stuff they say on air, folks.
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:24.961]  You know, these bubbledy, bubbledy, bubbledy.
[01:39:25.381 --> 01:39:29.743]  I mean, you know, they take this stuff really seriously.
[01:39:30.804 --> 01:39:34.966]  And, you know, New York Post, male porn stars bust into service them.
[01:39:35.426 --> 01:39:42.769]  Wall Street Journal, you know, Spy Magazine, Parade Magazine, mock sacrifices, now it's even
[01:39:43.710 --> 01:39:46.471]  Uh, in, uh, what, the 100 Greatest Vintage Photos.
[01:39:47.052 --> 01:39:51.594]  They admitted a mock human sacrifice, uh, with a photo of it released by them.
[01:39:51.854 --> 01:39:59.437]  They're kind of coming out, as you say, as they say, uh, with, uh, oh, a National Geographic 100 Vintage Photos.
[01:39:59.457 --> 01:40:00.898]  Look, here's a mock human sacrifice.
[01:40:02.114 --> 01:40:07.356]  It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and it's incredible.
[01:40:07.416 --> 01:40:08.477]  So it's lip service.
[01:40:08.557 --> 01:40:11.818]  They know that 80% of Americans call themselves Christian.
[01:40:12.198 --> 01:40:14.099]  About half of those people are practicing.
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:17.861]  And so it's about keeping them in the dark.
[01:40:18.781 --> 01:40:19.681]  That's all they're doing.
[01:40:19.741 --> 01:40:24.724]  Making Christians think, Oh, C. Bush is a Christian because the evil liberals are attacking him.
[01:40:24.744 --> 01:40:25.124]  Go ahead.
[01:40:26.224 --> 01:40:27.225]  That's exactly right.
[01:40:27.285 --> 01:40:30.366]  As I was listening to it and looking at my wife, I was just laughing at
[01:40:30.854 --> 01:40:41.136]  How gullible all these people must be listening to this baloney that they were saying and how he has prayer meetings and everything is prayer and everything is for God.
[01:40:41.196 --> 01:40:44.336]  He's gonna kill all the Arabs just for God and all this.
[01:40:44.356 --> 01:40:45.917]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:40:46.797 --> 01:40:50.317]  Anyway, I wanted to mention something else and that's that H.R.
[01:40:50.337 --> 01:40:51.898]  4200 which is in conference now.
[01:40:51.958 --> 01:40:54.058]  There's a hate crimes law.
[01:40:54.158 --> 01:40:59.419]  People should call their representatives and tell them to repeal that amendment 3138.
[01:41:01.192 --> 01:41:05.197]  Which makes it a state crime to say anything, basically.
[01:41:05.818 --> 01:41:07.380]  And they've passed these laws.
[01:41:08.722 --> 01:41:17.854]  The Republican governor of Pennsylvania, Schweiker, last year before he left, passed a law, and it was in the Associated Press,
[01:41:18.622 --> 01:41:26.086]  Saying, criticizing, reading out of the Old Testament, criticizing homosexuality, you can be arrested or fined.
[01:41:26.226 --> 01:41:26.466]  Yeah.
[01:41:26.887 --> 01:41:29.648]  And then the church has put out memos going, do not do this now.
[01:41:29.988 --> 01:41:33.410]  Folks, the government has no business controlling your free speech.
[01:41:33.450 --> 01:41:36.272]  And all those liberals out there going, good, that's hateful.
[01:41:36.572 --> 01:41:43.256]  Hey, idiots, when you go out with an anti-Bush shirt and get arrested at the mall, or arrested on the street corner,
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:46.101]  You know, we're going to defend you and your First Amendment.
[01:41:46.421 --> 01:41:48.482]  Don't you understand it's for everybody?
[01:41:49.023 --> 01:41:50.143]  That's how this works?
[01:41:51.044 --> 01:41:52.464]  And, exactly.
[01:41:52.624 --> 01:42:01.609]  And meanwhile, under Bush, they have radically expanded the Clinton-era training with Bush officials that homeschoolers, Christians, conservatives are terrorists.
[01:42:02.729 --> 01:42:05.771]  And they're not training the government that the Muslims are the terrorists.
[01:42:06.171 --> 01:42:08.732]  They're training them that it is Christians.
[01:42:09.213 --> 01:42:11.194]  And Christians are cheering and loving this.
[01:42:11.234 --> 01:42:11.734]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:12.361 --> 01:42:17.704]  Hey, really excellent points, Charles, in California.
[01:42:18.784 --> 01:42:22.146]  Yeah, I mean, Amy Goodman, I watch the show occasionally.
[01:42:22.206 --> 01:42:32.851]  They have really good information on it about the New World Order, about the war, about, you know, stuff that's going on, but again, it's like all this other so-called alternative media that's still at an establishment level.
[01:42:33.371 --> 01:42:38.734]  Then it's, and the evil right-wing militias are going to get you, and the Christian conservatives are very dangerous.
[01:42:40.875 --> 01:42:41.575]  On and on and on.
[01:42:42.499 --> 01:42:45.182]  This whole illusion, and Bush does have prayer meetings.
[01:42:45.262 --> 01:42:49.245]  He does call in, you know, 50 top preachers, and so did Bill Clinton.
[01:42:49.265 --> 01:42:55.110]  He'll have a prayer with them, and they can all think they're important and powerful, so they'll all go out and raise money for him and promote what he's doing.
[01:42:55.410 --> 01:42:59.534]  And get his faith-based initiative through to pay off and control and regulate the churches.
[01:43:01.155 --> 01:43:01.976]  I mean, that's admitted.
[01:43:02.717 --> 01:43:04.018]  And so it's a manipulation.
[01:43:04.058 --> 01:43:07.601]  Yeah, and then next week he calls in the Muslims, and he prays to Allah,
[01:43:09.011 --> 01:43:12.213]  And then the next week you've got a Shinto shrine clapping for the demon.
[01:43:12.733 --> 01:43:16.415]  They admit it's a little devil shrine over there.
[01:43:17.056 --> 01:43:20.298]  The Shintos, you know, have different sides of their yin-yang paradigm.
[01:43:20.318 --> 01:43:22.839]  It's this mean little god of wrath and power and Bush is there clapping, I summon thee!
[01:43:22.859 --> 01:43:36.027]  Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[01:43:38.078 --> 01:43:38.699]  Oh, please.
[01:43:38.939 --> 01:43:40.801]  But he says he loves Jesus.
[01:43:42.282 --> 01:43:43.843]  The devil will quote scripture.
[01:43:43.903 --> 01:43:45.565]  The devil will come as an angel of light.
[01:43:45.605 --> 01:43:45.985]  The devil.
[01:43:46.005 --> 01:43:47.006]  You know what the devil does?
[01:43:47.026 --> 01:43:47.547]  He lies.
[01:43:49.128 --> 01:43:51.430]  But again, people get sucked into believing Bush is good.
[01:43:51.450 --> 01:43:52.311]  Well, look at those liberals.
[01:43:52.651 --> 01:43:54.233]  They're attacking him because of his godliness.
[01:43:55.654 --> 01:43:58.376]  But I can't believe you're backing up those liberals, Alex.
[01:43:58.456 --> 01:43:59.297]  I can't believe it.
[01:43:59.717 --> 01:44:01.259]  I can't believe you're not for Bush.
[01:44:02.686 --> 01:44:05.367]  Well, why are you crying in glee?
[01:44:05.387 --> 01:44:08.047]  I was in the Republican Convention.
[01:44:08.147 --> 01:44:13.789]  It was crying, squeezing their hands, rubbing their hands together, sobbing.
[01:44:14.329 --> 01:44:14.569]  Women!
[01:44:16.129 --> 01:44:17.630]  When Arnold Schwarzenegger was speaking.
[01:44:17.970 --> 01:44:19.870]  Then I am a Republican!
[01:44:20.551 --> 01:44:28.012]  Because I want to ban all guns, and have total abortion, and open borders, and use baby parts for stem cell research.
[01:44:28.292 --> 01:44:30.053]  Then I am a Republican!
[01:44:30.803 --> 01:44:36.067]  I want a parliamentary procedure and I want to change the law in California.
[01:44:36.528 --> 01:44:38.990]  I want to take over America.
[01:44:39.610 --> 01:44:40.791]  We love you!
[01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:42.973]  You're more liberal than Bill Clinton!
[01:44:43.013 --> 01:44:44.494]  We just love you!
[01:44:44.934 --> 01:44:46.535]  Oh, please!
[01:44:50.839 --> 01:44:56.003]  I mean, again, I talk about Arnold once a week because he's always pulling something new.
[01:44:57.213 --> 01:44:58.794]  And the Republican leadership just loves him.
[01:44:58.834 --> 01:45:06.317]  They've got it all lined up in the House and Senate so he can be President to repeal the 22nd Amendment when they get a CON-CON going, a Constitutional Convention.
[01:45:06.617 --> 01:45:17.241]  You'll think it's about flag burning or, you know, gay marriage and that'll get voted down, don't worry, but once the CON-CON gets opened, everything else can be rewritten.
[01:45:18.104 --> 01:45:19.025]  And I'll make a prediction.
[01:45:19.065 --> 01:45:23.609]  If a CON-CON opens and goes to the states, there will be a terror attack during it.
[01:45:23.689 --> 01:45:26.672]  And who would have known Al-Qaeda would have hit during the CON-CON?
[01:45:26.692 --> 01:45:28.353]  Now we're rewriting the whole Bill of Rights.
[01:45:28.393 --> 01:45:30.555]  Oh, Arnold could be President now.
[01:45:31.416 --> 01:45:32.437]  I'm making that prediction.
[01:45:33.037 --> 01:45:37.000]  That if they can get a CON-CON, there will be a terror attack during the Constitutional Convention.
[01:45:38.402 --> 01:45:39.763]  Then you'll have Arnold in 08.
[01:45:40.203 --> 01:45:43.386]  Then again, I'll be the evil liberal for not being for him.
[01:45:43.726 --> 01:45:45.628]  You're a liberal because you're not for abortion.
[01:45:46.457 --> 01:45:48.778]  You're liberal because you're not for banning all guns!
[01:45:50.338 --> 01:45:52.679]  I love Arnold!
[01:45:53.259 --> 01:45:54.139]  He loves Hitler.
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:57.040]  And you're against him, so you're anti-Semitic.
[01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:59.641]  And, uh, he's good.
[01:45:59.661 --> 01:46:01.761]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:46:01.781 --> 01:46:02.502]  I'm out of control here.
[01:46:02.982 --> 01:46:04.562]  Let's talk to Eric in Texas.
[01:46:04.682 --> 01:46:05.362]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:46:05.402 --> 01:46:06.123]  I forgot he was there.
[01:46:06.543 --> 01:46:07.703]  Eric, what's on your mind today?
[01:46:08.223 --> 01:46:10.044]  I'm doing fine, how are you?
[01:46:10.164 --> 01:46:10.344]  Fine.
[01:46:10.384 --> 01:46:11.384]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:46:11.964 --> 01:46:14.225]  Well, I called recently for the Kerry
[01:46:15.356 --> 01:46:16.457]  It's a Kerry-Bush debate thing.
[01:46:16.697 --> 01:46:18.758]  I want to apologize to you in a mighty way.
[01:46:18.778 --> 01:46:19.539]  Why's that?
[01:46:19.659 --> 01:46:34.228]  Because you've been holding forever, and what happened is I get all these callers, and then I get who's in order mixed up quite often, and I was just notified that you were still there, and I'm glad they notified me, but go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:46:34.428 --> 01:46:38.751]  It's definitely a fix for Kerry to give the election to Bush.
[01:46:39.131 --> 01:46:41.032]  He's got too much involved in it.
[01:46:41.812 --> 01:46:43.814]  I don't know if I heard on your show or not,
[01:46:45.562 --> 01:46:51.908]  Two weeks after, or two months after 9-11, Bush repealed the President's Records Act, 1970s?
[01:46:53.049 --> 01:46:53.369]  Yes.
[01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:56.191]  It was not two months after 9-11.
[01:46:56.331 --> 01:46:58.353]  Two weeks?
[01:46:59.174 --> 01:47:00.415]  No, it was before 9-11.
[01:47:00.535 --> 01:47:13.506]  Yeah, when Bush first got in, I think the second thing he did, first he said, we are not going to investigate Bill Clinton, he sent a letter to Dan Burton saying leave Bill Clinton alone, drop it,
[01:47:14.648 --> 01:47:17.331]  And the neocons got on the radio and said, just drop it!
[01:47:17.751 --> 01:47:20.794]  You people out there standing up for Bill Clinton, let's just move on, you evil!
[01:47:21.074 --> 01:47:23.196]  You're probably liberals because you want to get Bill Clinton!
[01:47:23.636 --> 01:47:39.290]  I mean, I've literally heard stuff like this, okay, fine, I'll... That covers his father, and his father which was involved in... Exactly, and then in perpetuity now, nothing can be released on presidents ever, and he backed out, we were going to get in 2025,
[01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:43.431]  Uh, the Kennedy documents.
[01:47:43.672 --> 01:47:43.952]  Right.
[01:47:43.992 --> 01:47:46.514]  But now it's in 2045.
[01:47:46.794 --> 01:47:48.735]  Well, Kerry's involved in this Kennedy bill too.
[01:47:48.755 --> 01:47:49.496]  I'm sorry, I'm wrong.
[01:47:49.516 --> 01:47:49.496]  2050.
[01:47:50.276 --> 01:47:51.437]  Go ahead.
[01:47:51.537 --> 01:47:55.280]  Kerry is also involved in this cover-up also with Operation Watchtower.
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:56.020]  I'm sure you've heard of that.
[01:47:56.041 --> 01:47:57.462]  William Tyree, 50 years in prison.
[01:47:57.482 --> 01:47:57.622]  Yes.
[01:47:58.262 --> 01:48:03.386]  And so, he's got to be in to let Bush win.
[01:48:04.093 --> 01:48:05.614]  It's gotta be a scam from the beginning.
[01:48:05.854 --> 01:48:08.254]  You know, I think it's actually, nothing's rigged.
[01:48:08.334 --> 01:48:19.818]  I mean, we just have two guys that are cousins, and then Kerry's wife's formerly married to a Skull and Bones chieftain, and then Chaney is related to Bush and Kerry, and it's just all completely normal.
[01:48:20.198 --> 01:48:31.202]  Well, what I see with the military here, they're using our military as a police in Iraq, and then, equally, militarizing our police, and we have to do it all the way with the Puppet Company.
[01:48:32.006 --> 01:48:36.388]  They bring microwave guns to Iraq, sound guns to Iraq, the next month they're here.
[01:48:37.188 --> 01:48:41.510]  I mean, just everything they do, the training to be used on Iraqis is now being used on us.
[01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:56.977]  We're the slaves, we're the scum, we're the trash, we're the minions, we've got to learn to lick boots, it's for our own good, let's just wrap ourselves in a cellophane plastic American flag, desecrated, made by slaves in China, and just cry our eyes out at the baseball game.
[01:48:57.478 --> 01:48:58.298]  Hey, that's ridiculous.
[01:48:58.538 --> 01:49:00.159]  The baseball games are absolutely out of
[01:49:01.303 --> 01:49:02.444]  I just don't understand it.
[01:49:02.464 --> 01:49:02.964]  I don't watch it.
[01:49:02.984 --> 01:49:04.084]  I hear your shows.
[01:49:04.104 --> 01:49:05.905]  People calling in continuously about it.
[01:49:05.925 --> 01:49:07.426]  They're wasting their time.
[01:49:07.486 --> 01:49:09.707]  They're being just totally distracted with all that.
[01:49:09.967 --> 01:49:16.190]  Well, to not be a hypocrite, and I'm somebody who says that we shouldn't watch a bunch of sports and shouldn't do all this.
[01:49:16.210 --> 01:49:19.051]  Actually, I described the baseball bat as a toothpick.
[01:49:19.071 --> 01:49:20.632]  I had to get a look at it.
[01:49:20.652 --> 01:49:23.333]  And they went off last night and cracked another bat on a ball.
[01:49:23.833 --> 01:49:25.394]  I've never seen that happen so many times.
[01:49:25.834 --> 01:49:26.354]  I heard about it.
[01:49:26.374 --> 01:49:28.595]  Yeah, they got a bunch of... That's ridiculous.
[01:49:28.815 --> 01:49:30.316]  But I want to be honest.
[01:49:31.698 --> 01:49:34.999]  I did watch three innings of the Yankees and the Red Sox last night.
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:37.060]  I gotta stay away from it.
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:39.441]  And I haven't watched sports in, like, years.
[01:49:39.501 --> 01:49:42.782]  And it's like, I just started watching and going, ugh.
[01:49:43.002 --> 01:49:44.163]  But then I went back to work.
[01:49:44.523 --> 01:49:47.484]  I went back to work and worked till very late in the morning.
[01:49:47.504 --> 01:49:49.805]  Alright, good to hear from you.
[01:49:49.845 --> 01:49:50.905]  I appreciate your call, Eric.
[01:49:54.487 --> 01:49:57.348]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.090 --> 01:49:59.371]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:50:15.438 --> 01:50:19.243]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.483 --> 01:50:24.129]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:30.497]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft to the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.537 --> 01:50:32.360]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:37.026]  Your calls and a bunch of new developments about Europe and the US standardizing their driver's license, their passports.
[01:53:37.106 --> 01:53:41.109]  It's really already not the national ID card but the global ID card.
[01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:47.634]  But before we go to Rose in South Carolina and Jason and Joshua and Alan and Michael and everybody else.

[01:54:45.455 --> 01:54:46.296]  It's a great new video.
[01:54:46.316 --> 01:54:48.779]  And of course, I've made what?

[01:56:02.891 --> 01:56:04.492]  Rose in South Carolina.
[01:56:05.332 --> 01:56:06.533]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:56:06.853 --> 01:56:09.054]  Rose, you haven't called my show in years.
[01:56:09.494 --> 01:56:10.494]  Well, no.
[01:56:10.974 --> 01:56:12.295]  I've just been listening.
[01:56:13.375 --> 01:56:16.136]  I do have a little bit of information on the Vero chip.
[01:56:16.897 --> 01:56:17.357]  Oh, yes.
[01:56:17.417 --> 01:56:19.038]  Tell us all about it.
[01:56:19.298 --> 01:56:27.101]  I don't know how many South Carolinians you have listening, but we have got two Vero chip centers here in South Carolina.
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:30.903]  One in Charleston as well as Mount Pleasant.
[01:56:31.283 --> 01:56:37.849]  I knew they've opened 52 stores, so I guess you've got more than your fair share with us.
[01:56:37.889 --> 01:56:44.075]  Yes, Thomas M. Leland, MD, PhD, must be heading these two centers up.
[01:56:46.443 --> 01:56:50.307]  And so they're two in the lower part of the state, Mount Pleasant and Charleston.
[01:56:50.347 --> 01:56:51.969]  I was just giving people the heads up.
[01:56:52.069 --> 01:56:58.796]  But one interesting thing, they also have the picture of the CHIP bus.
[01:56:58.816 --> 01:57:03.762]  They got a huge bus and it says, don't forget kids, the CHIP mobile is on the move.
[01:57:04.924 --> 01:57:09.346]  Yes, and they have a big bus that has a chip, and it says, kids, get your chip!
[01:57:09.786 --> 01:57:10.906]  Get your chip today!
[01:57:10.926 --> 01:57:12.447]  That's a trademark little comment.
[01:57:12.907 --> 01:57:14.967]  And then we had one of the European distributors on.
[01:57:15.007 --> 01:57:17.348]  He said, Alex, the chip will prevail.
[01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:20.509]  Rose, I want to hear more about this.
[01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:21.770]  Stay with us, okay?
[01:57:22.650 --> 01:57:23.810]  It's good to hear from Rose.
[01:57:23.850 --> 01:57:26.951]  I mean, this lady's been calling in for, what, seven years or something?
[01:57:26.971 --> 01:57:28.672]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:57:28.692 --> 01:57:30.473]  Maybe seven, eight years.
[01:57:30.533 --> 01:57:31.913]  I haven't heard from you in a couple of years.
[01:57:32.933 --> 01:57:34.174]  Like a long lost friend.
[01:57:35.535 --> 01:57:37.516]  A rose by any other name is still a rose.
[01:57:37.536 --> 01:57:39.277]  I guess so.
[01:57:39.317 --> 01:57:40.458]  We'll be right back my dear.
[01:57:40.478 --> 01:57:40.998]  Stay with us.
[01:57:41.338 --> 01:57:41.679]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.437 --> 01:57:52.477]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.218 --> 01:57:54.298]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.958 --> 01:57:55.798]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.558 --> 01:57:58.459]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.479 --> 01:58:01.740]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:06.401]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.702 --> 01:58:10.882]  We're already into hour number three.
[01:58:11.062 --> 01:58:14.163]  I am so honored and blessed to be your host.
[01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:19.321]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:58:19.981 --> 01:58:21.021]  Central Standard Time.
[01:58:21.302 --> 01:58:26.463]  Coming up we'll get into the police state with Dwayne Coots, our resident technology expert.
[01:58:26.483 --> 01:58:28.184]  And I mean technology expert, folks.
[01:58:28.224 --> 01:58:29.244]  This guy's a real whiz.
[01:58:29.844 --> 01:58:32.005]  Multifaceted, multivariate expert.
[01:58:33.045 --> 01:58:34.305]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:58:34.365 --> 01:58:42.268]  We'll get to all of you from Jason to Michael to Joshua to Alan and a bunch of other news.
[01:58:44.008 --> 01:58:55.090]  Last hour, we had on the head lawyer for the ACLU in Nevada, where they're going to rush you with their new home inspections of your house.
[01:58:55.130 --> 01:58:57.591]  And if your house is any dirt or anything, they're going to rush you.
[01:58:57.951 --> 01:58:59.111]  They admit it's the law.
[01:58:59.151 --> 01:59:01.312]  The home inspectors will also be looking for drugs and guns.
[01:59:02.432 --> 01:59:05.793]  And I said, you know, Illinois, a town does that.
[01:59:05.873 --> 01:59:06.913]  Several others are starting.
[01:59:06.933 --> 01:59:11.034]  A couple years ago, people wake up with them shining flashlights on them, armed police,
[01:59:11.716 --> 01:59:15.820]  And they give them fines and more people are living there than are supposed to with the zoning.
[01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:17.602]  These are houses people own.
[01:59:17.722 --> 01:59:18.643]  Middle class folks.
[01:59:18.683 --> 01:59:19.844]  It's really bad for the poor folks.
[01:59:20.845 --> 01:59:26.611]  And it sounds unbelievable, but a caller did call in, and yes, I couldn't remember the name of the town.
[01:59:27.071 --> 01:59:29.413]  The lawyer from Nevada was aware of it.
[01:59:29.453 --> 01:59:31.195]  He couldn't remember the name.
[01:59:31.235 --> 01:59:36.240]  He did find an ACLU case going on in New Jersey with the same stuff, but it's Belleville.
[01:59:37.170 --> 01:59:38.451]  Belleville, Illinois.
[01:59:38.491 --> 01:59:39.671]  Good-sized city, town.
[01:59:40.372 --> 01:59:41.832]  And they just, no warrant.
[01:59:42.092 --> 01:59:47.855]  You just wake up with the police in your house and they go, we like to come by at night to really see how many people really live in the house.
[01:59:47.915 --> 01:59:51.677]  And they ticketed an old lady who had two toothbrushes.
[01:59:52.378 --> 01:59:55.559]  She put down on her form that one person lived there.
[01:59:57.060 --> 02:00:01.122]  And they came and it was just her, you know, there in the morning at 6.30, making coffee.
[02:00:01.943 --> 02:00:06.366]  And they walked in on her, and they walked right into her bathroom, just ignored her protesting.
[02:00:06.406 --> 02:00:06.907]  Who are you?
[02:00:06.927 --> 02:00:11.430]  They just walked right past her, pulled out another toothbrush, and said, two toothbrushes, you're fine.
[02:00:12.591 --> 02:00:14.592]  And our lawyer friend was aware of that.
[02:00:14.612 --> 02:00:23.198]  But now we have Collar, yes, that's the name, I couldn't remember it, Belleville, I knew it was a ville, Belleville, Illinois.
[02:00:23.378 --> 02:00:25.860]  I'm going to dig those articles back out, but you can read the
[02:00:26.863 --> 02:00:32.347]  You can read the Nevada story on Infowars.com from KLAS-TV and the Associated Press.
[02:00:32.367 --> 02:00:39.813]  But Rose in South Carolina, Rose just called in at the end of the last hour talking about the Get Chipped Mobile.
[02:00:40.194 --> 02:00:41.995]  Kids get chipped today driving around.
[02:00:42.015 --> 02:00:42.956]  They have a whole bunch of them.
[02:00:43.376 --> 02:00:47.019]  The implantation centers are going into her area of South Carolina.
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:50.422]  Rose, this is quite exciting.
[02:00:51.022 --> 02:00:51.783]  It's all happening.
[02:00:52.501 --> 02:00:56.325]  Well, yes, and this article just talks about what's going on in Japan.
[02:00:56.365 --> 02:01:08.017]  The RFD chip will be planted in kids' backpacks, so when they go to it, the gates will automatically open with the kid with the RFD chip planted in its backpack.
[02:01:08.758 --> 02:01:14.524]  It's just, you know, the gist of the article is just about what the chip is, you know,
[02:01:15.134 --> 02:01:16.595]  That's where it is.
[02:01:16.635 --> 02:01:22.839]  South America has had a contract to implant the military down there with the champ.
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:35.067]  They've got a contract with Bureau of Presence California that we got canceled protesting it and they have now implanted, last time I checked, over a thousand Mexican judicial workers.
[02:01:35.147 --> 02:01:37.248]  First it was 305, then it was 600.
[02:01:38.089 --> 02:01:40.090]  Now they're going to make all the federales take it.
[02:01:40.706 --> 02:01:42.707]  But again, when it was 300, it was top news.
[02:01:43.148 --> 02:01:46.610]  Now that it's thousands, it's just, eh, we're not even going to report on it anymore.
[02:01:46.650 --> 02:01:47.310]  You've got to have it.
[02:02:10.906 --> 02:02:13.808]  He's been teaching in the school in our area, Russian.
[02:02:14.448 --> 02:02:16.269]  Learned the kids to speak English.
[02:02:16.389 --> 02:02:20.191]  And there was three different nationalities there that he speaks.
[02:02:20.331 --> 02:02:23.453]  He speaks different languages and he was teaching the children.
[02:02:23.893 --> 02:02:30.077]  Now he's been called up to... Well, you know why all these Russians, nothing against them folks... No, no, I have nothing against them.
[02:02:30.117 --> 02:02:31.257]  No, no, no, let me add this.
[02:02:31.277 --> 02:02:32.318]  You know why they're moving in?
[02:02:32.958 --> 02:02:37.681]  Because they'll work for less in those car manufacturing plants.
[02:02:38.391 --> 02:02:42.818]  Most of those Russians formerly worked on tank assembly lines and helicopter assembly lines.
[02:02:43.476 --> 02:02:49.720]  And so there's articles where Poles and Russians will live 10 to an apartment, and then the vans pull up.

[02:05:57.497 --> 02:05:59.777]  Well into the third hour now, my friends.
[02:06:00.377 --> 02:06:02.238]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[02:06:02.858 --> 02:06:05.158]  Jason in New York, you're on the air.
[02:06:05.218 --> 02:06:05.678]  Go ahead.
[02:06:06.478 --> 02:06:07.119]  Um, Alex?
[02:06:07.639 --> 02:06:07.879]  Yes?
[02:06:08.459 --> 02:06:11.859]  Um, I just want to make a comment and I can hang up and you can answer.
[02:06:12.019 --> 02:06:15.320]  Um, have you heard of the movie called Final Cut by Robin Williams?
[02:06:16.602 --> 02:06:16.882]  No.
[02:06:17.363 --> 02:06:22.327]  A guy's about to come out on microchips and the big brother records everything type movie.
[02:06:22.928 --> 02:06:24.269]  And that's another question.
[02:06:24.829 --> 02:06:33.497]  Um, I'm 19 and I checked, you know, um, I'm going to college and signing up for all colleges and I look at all these, um, scholarships and everything.
[02:06:34.398 --> 02:06:39.862]  And it says you have to join the selective service so you could qualify for any kind of help or anything like that.
[02:06:40.203 --> 02:06:40.283]  Um,
[02:06:41.201 --> 02:06:49.103]  And then below it, it says even if you don't sign up for the program that you still is a mandatory law that you have to sign up for the selected service.
[02:06:49.623 --> 02:06:50.283]  Is this true?
[02:06:50.543 --> 02:06:51.084]  And that's all?
[02:06:53.304 --> 02:07:02.907]  No, it's it's color of law like everything else they tell you you have to but they can't force an axe murderer to sign anything.
[02:07:02.947 --> 02:07:04.467]  They can't force you to sign it.
[02:07:05.307 --> 02:07:07.948]  And whenever they do finally have a draft
[02:07:08.855 --> 02:07:16.037]  Uh, or if they do try one, they'll just persecute a few high-profile people to scare everyone else into going along with it.
[02:07:16.757 --> 02:07:32.661]  Oh, no, Alex, I was gonna hang up, but, um, so you're saying there's not a law because, you know... Yes, they claim, yeah, there's a regulation, uh, that when you're 18, you're supposed to register for the Selective Service, and most states make you do it when you get a driver's license.
[02:07:33.802 --> 02:07:39.067]  You have to do that right there at the DMV or bring a receipt that you've done it at the post office.
[02:07:39.567 --> 02:07:42.510]  But what I'm telling you is it's something they don't prosecute people for.
[02:07:43.190 --> 02:07:45.993]  It's like the government claims you have to do the census.
[02:07:46.873 --> 02:07:55.681]  Well, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution states, the Constitution itself states that you have to tell them how many people live in the house
[02:07:56.694 --> 02:08:02.480]  For congressional apportionment for how many House members your state gets according to population.
[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:13.029]  They cannot ask you what your name is, how many gallons your toilet is, how many cars you have, how much money is in your bank account, do you own a gun.
[02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:15.812]  Many of the census forms actually said that.
[02:08:15.832 --> 02:08:17.914]  They had a five question census form.
[02:08:18.778 --> 02:08:25.400]  A 52-question census form, a 200-something census question form, and different people got different census forms.
[02:08:26.061 --> 02:08:33.723]  I got the 54-question census, and I wouldn't answer, and the guy kept coming to my door threatening me, and I stuck a camera in his face a third time and said, get out of here!
[02:08:34.724 --> 02:08:37.465]  And he had a little plastic badge, thought he was a cop or something.
[02:08:38.185 --> 02:08:41.126]  And he said, you'll be arrested, and I said, good, and swam the door in his face.
[02:08:41.646 --> 02:08:44.987]  Then a federal judge in Houston said, no, you do not have to answer those questions.
[02:08:45.327 --> 02:08:47.008]  It's a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
[02:08:48.954 --> 02:08:50.955]  So again, they'll claim everything.
[02:08:50.975 --> 02:08:55.597]  I mean, this government has claimed that certain people weren't human and were slaves.
[02:08:56.037 --> 02:08:57.838]  It didn't make the law just or lawful.
[02:08:59.238 --> 02:08:59.879]  See what I'm saying?
[02:09:00.439 --> 02:09:02.139]  Yeah, so you definitely don't agree with that?
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:06.141]  Well, I never signed up for the Selective Service.
[02:09:08.602 --> 02:09:10.503]  So, come arrest me.
[02:09:10.913 --> 02:09:15.716]  Because I was hoping to get, you know, some financial help and all that, and it seems like... Yeah, that's what they do.
[02:09:15.837 --> 02:09:22.361]  Yeah, if you want to get something from their system, then, exactly, they will force you into it to do that.
[02:09:22.661 --> 02:09:32.008]  But again, sir, I mean, even if you sign up for Selective Service and the draft comes, I mean, even if you haven't signed up for Selective Service, they're still going to have you in a database and come after you.
[02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:33.969]  So I think it's a minor issue.
[02:09:34.590 --> 02:09:36.311]  And what would happen if you refuse anyway?
[02:09:38.072 --> 02:09:38.753]  And refuse to go?
[02:09:39.850 --> 02:09:44.633]  Uh, they'll arrest, uh, hundreds of people out of tens of thousands that refuse.
[02:09:47.175 --> 02:09:49.596]  And, um, how much is the jail term, if anything?
[02:09:50.057 --> 02:09:56.281]  Or why won't people even, if, if, if, not, if any 60% of the people say no, they, I don't think they would arrest everybody.
[02:09:56.661 --> 02:09:57.281]  Well, exactly.
[02:09:57.301 --> 02:10:05.647]  You know, I don't have the law in front of me, but I know of people, uh, spending, uh, seven, eight years in prison, uh, for refusing to be drafted.
[02:10:06.988 --> 02:10:07.568]  Thanks for the call.
[02:10:07.648 --> 02:10:09.069]  I really do appreciate your call.
[02:10:09.902 --> 02:10:13.403]  We're going to go to Joshua and Alan and Michael and others here in just a few minutes.
[02:10:14.064 --> 02:10:17.185]  I am honored to have him on the broadcast with us.
[02:10:17.245 --> 02:10:22.166]  It's been probably a year since we had Dwayne Coots, my good friend, on.
[02:10:22.226 --> 02:10:37.692]  He's the guy who is the backbone and the IT specialist for InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com, and our Second Amendment website, VirginUtah.com.
[02:10:38.769 --> 02:10:41.871]  And we're honored to have him on with us to talk about Internet 2.
[02:10:42.312 --> 02:10:48.456]  Michael Powell wanting to regulate the net in the name of helping streamline all these free phone calls you can make over the net.
[02:10:49.177 --> 02:10:59.565]  And he's also here to talk about the relaunch of Prison Planet TV and the relaunch of InfoWars.net.
[02:10:59.825 --> 02:11:01.066]  Duane, good to have you on with us.
[02:11:01.386 --> 02:11:02.427]  Hey, good afternoon Alex.
[02:11:02.447 --> 02:11:03.208]  Thanks for having me, man.
[02:11:03.588 --> 02:11:04.389]  You bet, my friend.
[02:11:05.478 --> 02:11:10.760]  You know, you've been my provider for my servers and stuff for the last, what, five years?
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:13.881]  Yeah, it looks like, pretty close to that, yes sir.
[02:11:14.241 --> 02:11:28.807]  And before that I had nothing but problems, you have just done a fabulous job, and I've always been able to call you in the middle of the night when we occasionally do have a problem, and as we've gone through amazing growth, but so much has happened with the web
[02:11:29.602 --> 02:11:42.606]  Last time we had you on, we were talking about scumware and spyware, and now it's expanded out into open discussions of taxation, regulation, internet 2, the death of the old net, making us go to this new net, where we're regulated and controlled.
[02:11:43.286 --> 02:11:48.288]  Give us your summation, your forecast, your chronicle of what's going on with the internet right now.
[02:11:49.648 --> 02:11:52.169]  Well, the crunch that's occurring
[02:11:53.362 --> 02:12:15.503]  Between, that's pretty easy to follow now, the crunch that is occurring in between the telecom companies and the folks that operate network systems at the backbone level, at the, you know, the big pipe level, we call it, you know, where folks are, you know, they're routing, the majority of the traffic is getting routed through fewer and fewer switch points.
[02:12:16.290 --> 02:12:26.692]  In the name of consolidating that traffic, and by traffic I mean all the requests that we all make back and forth between each other, you know, sending emails, surfing web pages, things like that.
[02:12:27.112 --> 02:12:40.215]  Well, that traffic is being consolidated and routed through fewer and fewer main core systems in the name of improving, you know, the control and things like that.
[02:12:40.635 --> 02:12:41.715]  But, as you well know,
[02:12:46.508 --> 02:12:48.669]  Well, we just lost our guest.
[02:12:49.249 --> 02:12:52.931]  We just lost all the phones.
[02:12:53.391 --> 02:12:54.912]  We didn't lose any satellites, did we?
[02:12:58.054 --> 02:13:00.415]  Somebody didn't want us to talk about this stuff, I guess.
[02:13:01.856 --> 02:13:03.756]  We'll dial him on a backline or something.
[02:13:03.796 --> 02:13:06.518]  Let's get him back on and start all the callers that got dumped.
[02:13:06.898 --> 02:13:08.019]  That happens every once in a while.
[02:13:09.359 --> 02:13:11.580]  But, see, Dwayne's saying exactly what I've said.
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:15.042]  You know, we see these announcements that the Internet will die.
[02:13:15.962 --> 02:13:18.724]  And they say, because the backbone hubs just can't handle it.
[02:13:19.305 --> 02:13:21.346]  But five companies own these hubs.
[02:13:21.786 --> 02:13:25.069]  They've consolidated, bought out all the other hubs, but they've been turning them off.
[02:13:25.549 --> 02:13:31.994]  And they're forcing them through these hubs that are being overloaded and not replacing them, not upgrading, which is quite easy to do.
[02:13:32.794 --> 02:13:37.758]  And then they're saying, OK, we're just going to build this Internet, too, and make you go on to our new network.
[02:13:39.009 --> 02:13:47.178]  And then under this new Internet 2, you go to an institution or agency, and they decide if you get a subdomain name with them.
[02:13:47.878 --> 02:14:01.853]  And so they're saying, British members of government, US government members, heads of industry, they just had the Internet 2 conference a few weeks ago in Austin, they said that over the next few years, they're just going to let the old net die, shut down,
[02:14:03.038 --> 02:14:04.982]  They're just not going to fix the highway, basically.
[02:14:05.623 --> 02:14:10.933]  And then they're going to build this giant toll road right next to it where there's no freedom, and then force you onto that.
[02:14:11.754 --> 02:14:12.636]  Did we get Dwayne back?
[02:14:14.096 --> 02:14:17.777]  Okay, Dwayne, I'm sorry, that happens maybe twice a year, and it happened when you were on.
[02:14:18.418 --> 02:14:22.699]  Oh, hey, folks just don't like what's being talked about sometimes.
[02:14:23.079 --> 02:14:23.840]  I mean, exactly.
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:34.644]  So we've got these people who've been buying up all the hubs, shutting down others, and then they say, the last three weeks, they said at the Internet2 conference, we're not going to upgrade these anymore.
[02:14:35.144 --> 02:14:38.545]  We're going to let this die, and then force you onto Internet2.
[02:14:38.585 --> 02:14:42.627]  And I talked to the average IT person, they're not aware of it, Dwayne, but as usual, you are.
[02:14:43.231 --> 02:14:50.594]  Well, something that's happening, and I'm actually surprised that you're coming at me with this, because you're right.
[02:14:51.235 --> 02:14:54.096]  Most admins aren't even aware of what's happening.
[02:14:55.217 --> 02:15:08.703]  Some of the strange things that we've been seeing, usually consolidation, just like the toll roads there that you've been talking about frequently, it's a very good example to use when you're talking about the Internet.
[02:15:09.343 --> 02:15:11.584]  We're huddling more and more folks
[02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:12.480]  All right.
[02:15:24.785 --> 02:15:35.659]  The more you regulate and control the flow of traffic, any kind of traffic, from human pedestrians to internet traffic to telephone conversations to voice over IP, it doesn't matter.
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:42.828]  That consolidation and control simply leads to more exposure to abuse and spying.
[02:15:43.976 --> 02:16:05.818]  You know, surveillance and the whole Big Brother scheme that we're fighting, just like we were talking about RFID chips not too long ago, you know, well now RFID chips are, you know, are being mainstreamed as quickly as possible and, you know, no one thinks, okay, well, you know, I have a RFID chip in me, well, I can just walk up to my ATM and withdraw money and I don't even have to punch a code in.
[02:16:06.458 --> 02:16:16.050]  Uh, but, uh, no one seems to think, you know, no one seems to take a second to think that, you know, uh, someone who would rob you would certainly gouge that RFID chip out of you.
[02:16:16.070 --> 02:16:21.137]  Uh, if they would shoot you, they would certainly, you know, do a little quick surgery to get that chip from you.
[02:16:21.537 --> 02:16:22.297]  We're good to go.
[02:16:41.145 --> 02:16:41.746]  I think so.
[02:16:58.955 --> 02:17:17.445]  Well nicely, I guess that's a relative term, so sinisterly, if that's a word, it parallels so sinisterly with the rest of this technology which is being developed faster than the technology can breathe and the consequences of that introduction can be realized.
[02:17:18.192 --> 02:17:24.175]  Uh, what we're seeing here lately is just like the consolidation of, uh, uh, okay, the, the bills were broken up.
[02:17:24.556 --> 02:17:32.700]  Well, if anyone who's in this business knows that there is still a monopoly in the phone company, there are just now six monopolies instead of one monopoly.
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:35.041]  Uh, and, and those... It's a cartel.
[02:17:35.422 --> 02:17:35.822]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:35.862 --> 02:17:36.662]  It is a cartel.
[02:17:36.682 --> 02:17:40.004]  We're going to be right back with Dwayne Coots, our, uh, computer guru.
[02:17:40.024 --> 02:17:40.404]  Stay with us.

[02:18:45.283 --> 02:18:48.764]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:18:49.024 --> 02:18:52.525]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:18:52.625 --> 02:18:56.566]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:18:56.787 --> 02:19:02.948]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:19:03.369 --> 02:19:11.271]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:19:11.671 --> 02:19:17.013]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:19:17.173 --> 02:19:20.934]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:21.314 --> 02:19:23.154]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclainable.
[02:19:23.234 --> 02:19:25.415]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[02:19:44.176 --> 02:19:46.657]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[02:19:47.038 --> 02:19:49.959]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[02:19:50.119 --> 02:19:53.761]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[02:19:53.962 --> 02:19:56.383]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[02:19:56.563 --> 02:19:59.805]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[02:19:59.985 --> 02:20:07.329]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[02:20:07.569 --> 02:20:09.250]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.
[02:20:09.330 --> 02:20:13.132]  You can also get AM and FM, listen to cassettes, and control your CD changer.
[02:20:13.252 --> 02:20:15.173]  Call Freeway Radio today, toll-free, 866-404-3600.
[02:20:15.193 --> 02:20:15.914]  That's 1-866-404-3600.
[02:20:15.954 --> 02:20:18.535]  Get your own Sony shortwave car stereo today for only $189.
[02:20:18.675 --> 02:20:20.296]  Install it in the boat, the RV, or your car.
[02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:31.366]  The good news for us is that you'll have GCN programming and crystal clear radio wherever you go.
[02:20:31.486 --> 02:20:36.573]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[02:20:36.673 --> 02:20:39.176]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[02:20:44.611 --> 02:20:46.832]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:20:47.273 --> 02:20:51.635]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:20:51.895 --> 02:20:57.699]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:20:57.939 --> 02:21:01.982]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:21:02.282 --> 02:21:07.925]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[02:21:08.045 --> 02:21:10.647]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:21:12.748 --> 02:21:16.650]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:21:16.690 --> 02:21:19.072]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:21:19.412 --> 02:21:21.713]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:21:22.094 --> 02:21:25.716]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:21:26.196 --> 02:21:32.400]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:33.841]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:21:34.161 --> 02:21:34.521]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:34.541 --> 02:21:34.781]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.759 --> 02:21:57.249]  Michael and Roger and Johnny and Allen and Kyle will take your five calls coming up in the next segment and that's going to be it for calls.
[02:21:57.329 --> 02:21:59.894]  I've got some other news I want to go over with Dwayne Cooch.
[02:22:01.125 --> 02:22:03.646]  Dwayne, again, we talk about IT stuff.
[02:22:03.746 --> 02:22:06.868]  We haven't talked about consolidation, the hubs being taken over.
[02:22:07.348 --> 02:22:10.029]  And I get you on the air, I bring it up, you're on the same page.
[02:22:10.530 --> 02:22:17.233]  You know, I just went off what industry officials said, because they love to brag about what they're going to do before they do it.
[02:22:17.293 --> 02:22:19.394]  And people years later go, man, how did you know that?
[02:22:19.434 --> 02:22:20.494]  Are you a government agent?
[02:22:21.294 --> 02:22:22.415]  No, I went and read what they said.
[02:22:22.755 --> 02:22:24.256]  But over the last few months, they said,
[02:22:24.836 --> 02:22:36.192]  We're not, you know, the internet hubs that we have consolidated down to five companies are not going to be upgraded, and we're upgrading the new internet too, and it will be regulated and controlled.
[02:22:36.212 --> 02:22:40.198]  You'll have to have an IP address under us, and we'll control what you can say and do, quote for security.
[02:22:40.991 --> 02:22:43.513]  And of course there won't be all these free phone calls over it.
[02:22:44.454 --> 02:22:46.056]  And so they say they're going to do it.
[02:22:46.096 --> 02:22:56.805]  I see the exact same statements the same day from members of the House of Commons as members of Sun Microsystems or Cisco here in this country.
[02:22:57.837 --> 02:23:02.240]  And then I go to the Internet2 website, and it's run by the Defense Department, basically.
[02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:05.442]  I mean, it's obvious what they're going to pull off.
[02:23:05.983 --> 02:23:06.523]  It's simple.
[02:23:07.203 --> 02:23:09.885]  And I can't believe that they're going to try to get away with this.
[02:23:09.945 --> 02:23:16.730]  And as you said, the average IT person isn't even aware that this is coming down the pike like a ton of bricks on top of us.
[02:23:17.330 --> 02:23:30.480]  Well sure, I mean, and let's not forget they used very cleverly the sympathetic justification recently with probably the only mainstream headline that came out from this.
[02:23:31.565 --> 02:23:49.222]  Or one of the most broadly played headlines was that the internet is just simply growing too large and more third world countries are coming online and as those computers come online the internet is just simply being overloaded and we don't have enough IP addresses to go around and blah blah blah
[02:23:49.662 --> 02:23:50.503]  And that's not true.
[02:23:50.723 --> 02:23:52.565]  You just add more servers.
[02:23:52.866 --> 02:23:54.788]  They've got plenty of pipe, Duane.
[02:23:55.248 --> 02:23:58.572]  I mean, the net went through real growing pain six, seven, eight years ago.
[02:23:58.752 --> 02:23:59.473]  Sure.
[02:23:59.834 --> 02:24:01.876]  Okay, but we're getting back to consolidation.
[02:24:02.256 --> 02:24:06.361]  It is certainly in the interest of the powers that be to consolidate.
[02:24:06.741 --> 02:24:16.803]  So they create artificial scarcity by not upgrading the hubs themselves, shutting off other hubs, buying up other hubs, and then when they do this, people won't understand.
[02:24:16.843 --> 02:24:23.205]  I mean, it's like Michael Powell says, I want to help voice over internet grow, all these free phone calls.
[02:24:23.225 --> 02:24:25.665]  Folks, I mean, if you have internet service, you can make the phone calls.
[02:24:25.965 --> 02:24:28.606]  They have services that streamline it for you for a small price.
[02:24:28.966 --> 02:24:30.666]  The phone companies aren't going to put up with that.
[02:24:31.026 --> 02:24:31.907]  Right, and they're not.
[02:24:32.307 --> 02:24:33.027]  That is the
[02:24:33.977 --> 02:24:50.133]  If any of your listeners are even casual television watchers, they will notice a very, very widespread campaign recently by the telcos, and they're trying to portray the telecommunications laws as being so antiquated.
[02:24:50.513 --> 02:24:52.314]  And we want to bring you the future now.
[02:24:52.354 --> 02:24:53.755]  We want to bring you the future now.
[02:24:54.095 --> 02:24:56.156]  So we need to update our telecom laws.
[02:24:56.536 --> 02:25:01.699]  Well, what they're doing, they're just simply trying to change the way that voice over IP is looked at.
[02:25:02.059 --> 02:25:08.763]  They want to make it a data transfer rather, a telecommunications transfer rather than a data transfer.
[02:25:08.843 --> 02:25:15.566]  Which, Michael Powell said yesterday, will bring regulatory FCC control over everything you do on the web.
[02:25:15.767 --> 02:25:16.327]  Exactly.
[02:25:17.107 --> 02:25:34.319]  And that will backdoor them into treating, every time you ask for a webpage, with the same legal Patriot 2 and 3 and 4 to come, absolutely squelching your rights of privacy, just as they do with telephone calls.
[02:25:34.739 --> 02:25:39.923]  But more than that, they want to tax every email, they want to charge more for bandwidth,
[02:25:40.709 --> 02:25:41.410]  It's a nightmare!
[02:25:56.608 --> 02:26:02.250]  Okay, I'm more than willing to accept that, if it was such an innocent premise, and if that was the only thing going on.
[02:26:02.270 --> 02:26:03.150]  Well, that's just not true!
[02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:08.972]  You just add, you know, you just add .cat, .dog, it's unlimited!
[02:26:09.112 --> 02:26:12.173]  Right, well, I mean, we're basically talking the numbering system.
[02:26:12.834 --> 02:26:21.277]  You know, the IP addresses, the quadratic expression of individual machines labeled by address, basically.
[02:26:21.317 --> 02:26:22.557]  Your internet address is a set of numbers.
[02:26:22.577 --> 02:26:25.318]  But there's unlimited calculations and permutations of numbers.
[02:26:26.123 --> 02:26:32.371]  It's basically, that's basically true, especially when you consider the fact that most machines that have
[02:26:33.001 --> 02:26:40.084]  IP addresses, the vast majority of machines that are assigned IP addresses could actually be on subnets.
[02:26:40.445 --> 02:26:41.625]  And so it's the same story.
[02:26:41.865 --> 02:26:44.166]  We're running out of water, we've got to double your prices.
[02:26:44.186 --> 02:26:45.947]  We're running out of oil, we've got to double your prices.
[02:26:46.167 --> 02:26:48.428]  The internet's dying, we've got to take it over and save it.
[02:26:48.608 --> 02:26:54.051]  And everybody runs around buying this garbage, Dwayne, when the actual facts just show the opposite.
[02:26:54.091 --> 02:26:55.011]  Just show the opposite.
[02:26:55.031 --> 02:26:56.472]  But they're telling us what they're doing.
[02:26:56.952 --> 02:26:58.614]  Meanwhile, the telcos are making it.
[02:26:58.954 --> 02:27:00.435]  You know, they're doing the sympathy play.
[02:27:00.495 --> 02:27:04.579]  Oh, we can't bring you the future today unless you go to Congress and give us new laws.
[02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:06.581]  You know, and it's all converging.
[02:27:06.901 --> 02:27:10.605]  Well, the thing about Internet 2 and the telcos and all this...
[02:27:11.218 --> 02:27:28.104]  They are on the verge of bringing this all around to where there will be so many addressable points, basically IPs, that not only can every device, including your toaster, your printer, your bar stool, everything in your life, could have an ID number.
[02:27:28.184 --> 02:27:28.865]  That's what they've said.
[02:27:28.905 --> 02:27:31.526]  They've said everything will be tracked with a chip.
[02:27:31.546 --> 02:27:32.006]  Stay there.
[02:27:32.126 --> 02:27:33.466]  And that's been in the mainstream news.
[02:27:33.886 --> 02:27:34.647]  Dwayne, stay there.
[02:27:34.667 --> 02:27:35.207]  Call's coming up.
[02:27:36.084 --> 02:27:37.004]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.464 --> 02:27:39.105]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.125 --> 02:27:42.845]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.786 --> 02:27:48.947]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[02:27:49.187 --> 02:27:51.607]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[02:27:51.867 --> 02:27:57.028]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[02:27:57.188 --> 02:27:57.889]  Well, no more.
[02:27:58.069 --> 02:28:01.009]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[02:28:01.329 --> 02:28:04.530]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:10.292]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[02:28:10.512 --> 02:28:13.052]  It's called Hyaluronic Acid or HA.
[02:28:13.333 --> 02:28:21.095]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[02:28:21.315 --> 02:28:24.516]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[02:28:24.736 --> 02:28:28.977]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[02:28:29.257 --> 02:28:32.238]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[02:28:32.458 --> 02:28:35.180]  Call 1-800-707-3953 and get one bottle free when you buy two.
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:37.681]  Remember, call 1-800-707-3953 and get your free bottle of Injuv when you buy two.
[02:28:37.701 --> 02:28:38.101]  Call today!
[02:28:45.737 --> 02:28:47.358]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.498 --> 02:28:51.580]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:54.621]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.701 --> 02:29:01.425]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.605 --> 02:29:04.606]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:04.806 --> 02:29:07.208]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.328 --> 02:29:12.050]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:26.795]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:29:26.955 --> 02:29:33.597]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:46.720]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:48.020]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:51.621]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:29:51.721 --> 02:29:52.181]  Phenol?
[02:29:52.461 --> 02:29:59.523]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:30:00.083 --> 02:30:03.987]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:30:04.087 --> 02:30:04.527]  Fragrance?
[02:30:04.908 --> 02:30:09.672]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:30:09.812 --> 02:30:14.497]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[02:30:14.717 --> 02:30:17.280]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:20.963]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:30:21.103 --> 02:30:24.607]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:30:24.827 --> 02:30:27.148]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:28.229]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:28.349 --> 02:30:38.095]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[02:30:38.295 --> 02:30:40.777]  Call CalBen toll free 1-800-340-7091 or visit CalBenPureSoap.com
[02:30:51.421 --> 02:31:06.234]  In the last couple weeks, I have seen scores of articles saying that every can of Campbell's soup, every razor, your refrigerator, every bit of clothes you have, that'll all have its own IP address and with a wireless internet,
[02:31:07.214 --> 02:31:09.457]  It'll all scan and track what you buy, what you do.
[02:31:09.477 --> 02:31:19.549]  I mean, this is total big brother, Dwayne, and they're engineering the whole society just so when you go buy a new car or a new refrigerator or a can of soup, it has it in it where you don't have a choice.
[02:31:19.569 --> 02:31:26.197]  Yes, it reduces the need for human spying.
[02:31:27.495 --> 02:31:36.829]  By really just simplifying the way that data is tracked and parsed and assigned to various databases.
[02:31:37.510 --> 02:31:39.834]  You used the example of buying a car, Alex.
[02:31:41.095 --> 02:31:46.959]  You buy that car, and then immediately you're driving down the road, you set your radio stations.
[02:31:46.999 --> 02:31:52.123]  Well, your radio stations preferences are automatically cataloged and stored in a database.
[02:31:52.663 --> 02:32:00.769]  And based on that, that data is computed and figured out, you know, what your preferences are, what you like to listen to.
[02:32:01.349 --> 02:32:02.630]  Well, here's an example.
[02:32:02.690 --> 02:32:07.815]  Already with the Red Sox and the Yankees last night, and again, I've never watched baseball, but yeah, I've watched three innings of it.
[02:32:20.956 --> 02:32:22.858]  Or Austin were projecting.
[02:32:22.878 --> 02:32:28.143]  You know how when you go to a baseball field, they've got Bank of America, you know, whatever, banners.
[02:32:28.283 --> 02:32:29.004]  Oh, sure, sure.
[02:32:29.204 --> 02:32:37.832]  Well, they were projecting where you couldn't tell it was fake, with computers, local Austin businesses on that, and the computers do that nationwide.
[02:32:37.892 --> 02:32:43.017]  Now they're saying within a few years, your high-definition TV, which now has all these weird components in it,
[02:32:43.557 --> 02:32:45.899]  Yes, and it all started with a simple little first down marker in the NFL.
[02:32:59.357 --> 02:33:10.762]  The projected first down yellow line stripe that is projected electronically onto the field that shows where the next first down is in football was all the beginning of that.
[02:33:11.222 --> 02:33:19.846]  And now it's at a breakneck pace that's going to be introduced so rapidly until we will see what you just spoke of will be happening.
[02:33:20.206 --> 02:33:28.530]  And that's the same thing of when you're on one of these big sites and they've got your cookies and all of a sudden you go to sites about guns and there's gun ads there.
[02:33:28.590 --> 02:33:29.910]  Absolutely, right, right.
[02:33:31.371 --> 02:33:32.471]  It's a perfect example.
[02:33:33.752 --> 02:33:44.837]  Data is power and data is more than money because in the world of the future that we're being shoved into now, data will be money.
[02:33:45.419 --> 02:33:46.340]  Money will be data.
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:48.381]  It'll be a total cashless society.
[02:33:49.181 --> 02:33:50.922]  Your IP address will identify.
[02:33:51.182 --> 02:33:53.723]  That's what we were getting around to before the last break, my friend.
[02:33:54.864 --> 02:34:07.771]  It's very apparent that a virtually limitless, and I mean into the hundreds of trillions and multiples of that, if you have an unlimited amount of addressable data items,
[02:34:08.371 --> 02:34:14.594]  Then you can basically make every human being have their own IP address from birth to death.
[02:34:14.775 --> 02:34:22.018]  And they said, again in USA Today, like four years ago now, when they first announced RFID's coming, you can't stop it, it'll be in everything by 04.
[02:34:22.399 --> 02:34:24.660]  Now they're about a year or two behind because of protest.
[02:34:25.553 --> 02:34:40.542]  They said in there that they will create a detailed psychological algorithm, and it's called the LifeLog program, with the Defense Department, Walmart, and others, where they will literally monitor every breath, every word you speak, everything you buy, everything you do.
[02:34:41.798 --> 02:34:54.772]  Right, and as storage media becomes more prominent, the first argument that you would get when you present that point is that, well, how could they possibly store or handle all of this data?
[02:34:55.052 --> 02:34:57.615]  You know, the CIA's attempts to monitor
[02:34:57.975 --> 02:35:04.940]  You know, our transmissions and emails and cell phone calls, was a miserable flop because they simply couldn't process the information fast enough.
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:13.686]  They're weeks behind on the translation of their documents because they're spying on Islamic terrorists now and all of this has developed.
[02:35:14.286 --> 02:35:15.908]  Sorry, don't believe it.
[02:35:16.668 --> 02:35:17.308]  Won't believe it.
[02:35:17.389 --> 02:35:18.249]  Won't ever believe it.
[02:35:18.609 --> 02:35:20.731]  The information does not have to be stored.
[02:35:21.151 --> 02:35:26.455]  It simply has to be catalogued and all of the triggers that that information
[02:35:27.365 --> 02:35:30.526]  Uh, sets off need to be flipped.
[02:35:30.947 --> 02:35:36.869]  Once those switches are flipped, that the information gleaned from your conversations, cell phone calls, things like that.
[02:35:37.329 --> 02:35:41.851]  Once, once those processes are put in motion, they don't need the information anymore.
[02:35:41.891 --> 02:35:49.815]  So there's no need to store the fact that you, uh, you know, you had a discussion in the aisle of Walmart about, you know, how to make a bomb.
[02:35:50.195 --> 02:35:50.495]  Okay?
[02:35:50.715 --> 02:35:52.936]  The simple fact was that you had that discussion.
[02:35:53.316 --> 02:35:54.917]  That incident is cataloged.
[02:35:55.217 --> 02:36:06.082]  The actual words are lost because... And by the way, there's already so much data corruption, it's very easy for them to put in false data and no way to prove it as being false.
[02:36:06.362 --> 02:36:09.083]  Okay, my friend, this is where we get into Winston's world.
[02:36:09.844 --> 02:36:23.790]  As soon as everything is numbers and data, no more money, no more anything that's tangible, what basic use will human beings have except to be slaves, more than we are now?
[02:36:24.721 --> 02:36:29.645]  Now we're just some strange hybrid self-thinking people.
[02:36:29.885 --> 02:36:38.091]  We're doing our best to fight for what we believe in, but the problem is they're changing the world underneath us.
[02:36:38.592 --> 02:36:44.877]  We're stamping our foot and bracing our spines and squaring our shoulders to this brave new world.
[02:36:45.677 --> 02:36:50.020]  Unfortunately, the world is changing where we can't see it behind the scenes.
[02:36:50.341 --> 02:36:51.822]  These technological developments
[02:36:52.282 --> 02:36:52.783]  I think so.
[02:37:07.148 --> 02:37:08.968]  You know, easy to understand format.
[02:37:09.108 --> 02:37:09.488]  It's amazing.
[02:37:09.569 --> 02:37:10.949]  I commend you for what you do.
[02:37:10.989 --> 02:37:12.949]  Well, I don't know about... I mean, I appreciate that, DeWayne.
[02:37:12.989 --> 02:37:20.711]  I just look at it with horror as they build this giant high-tech cage and phase out jobs for humans to perform and claim it's for cost-cutting, but it's not.
[02:37:21.331 --> 02:37:22.511]  It's about total control.
[02:37:22.751 --> 02:37:22.971]  Right.
[02:37:23.171 --> 02:37:27.292]  And then they're shifting the economy out of free market into surveillance police state grid.
[02:37:27.312 --> 02:37:34.254]  And then it's going where, you know, a few dozen globalist controllers are going to have everything robotically programmed and controlled.
[02:37:34.534 --> 02:37:35.954]  The fighter wings, the tanks,
[02:37:36.961 --> 02:37:37.282]  Oh, sure, sure.
[02:37:37.302 --> 02:37:38.383]  Being removed from society
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:57.741]  is just as definite a death sentence as dying.
[02:37:58.141 --> 02:38:13.144]  And by the way, now a lot of people when they go to court, they're in the jail cell with a camera on them, they're not allowed to be in the courtroom, or when you try to get your filings or your briefs, you have to do it on the internet, and then, oh, we never got your filing, or we're not going to give you a copy of it.
[02:38:13.404 --> 02:38:15.825]  It's just incredible control.
[02:38:16.065 --> 02:38:17.845]  Right, that's exactly what we're talking about.
[02:38:17.885 --> 02:38:20.466]  You can be programmed out of existence.
[02:38:20.806 --> 02:38:23.688]  So people ask, why did DARPA create the internet?
[02:38:23.848 --> 02:38:27.411]  Why did they let us use it as this great tool of freedom to expose them?
[02:38:27.991 --> 02:38:29.312]  Well, because it's a catch-22.
[02:38:29.672 --> 02:38:30.613]  It's a cost-benefit.
[02:38:30.673 --> 02:38:32.394]  They believe they're going to get us addicted to it.
[02:38:33.271 --> 02:38:36.192]  By the way, folks, even if you're not on the web, again, this is expanding.
[02:38:36.232 --> 02:38:37.093]  You can't escape it.
[02:38:37.333 --> 02:38:39.934]  It's a tool you've got to use and learn and fight for.
[02:38:40.374 --> 02:38:47.717]  We've got to overpower them, which I think we've got the power to do with the hundreds of millions of users of the net who are informed about what's happening.
[02:38:47.757 --> 02:39:00.463]  Because the net is becoming your car, is becoming that Campbell's Soup can, is becoming the RFID-embedded gun you buy, is becoming the digital checks that you're sent instead of the originals.
[02:39:01.204 --> 02:39:15.710]  You have to get involved in it, and I've thought about this long and hard, to be part of it and to be informed about it and to dominate it, instead of just being passive users of it that let your course be set like a bunch of spectators.
[02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:20.032]  Now, I want to go to calls to Wayne, but this brings us to InfoWars.net.
[02:39:20.612 --> 02:39:25.114]  I never talk about the services, I never talk about all the things that are offered, the things that it does.
[02:39:25.494 --> 02:39:27.916]  We have proxy servers, you know, the proxy
[02:39:30.317 --> 02:39:30.997]  Browsers.
[02:39:31.117 --> 02:39:33.159]  Anonymous browser, right.
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:35.301]  There's so much that's offered.
[02:39:35.321 --> 02:39:40.304]  We're now offering internet service with no free speech regulation.
[02:39:43.146 --> 02:39:45.228]  Folks, this is a place you need to go.
[02:39:45.288 --> 02:39:46.409]  You need to be part of.
[02:39:46.429 --> 02:39:51.512]  Duane, I want you to start writing briefs for folks for the sign-up.
[02:39:52.253 --> 02:39:56.316]  There's so much we can do with this that people will join it and be part of it in this fight.
[02:39:56.556 --> 02:39:57.837]  Tell us about Infowars.net.
[02:39:58.638 --> 02:39:59.118]  Well, sure.
[02:39:59.138 --> 02:40:07.261]  For the longest time, I mean, we coasted along, you know, and folks were getting involved and everything is fine.
[02:40:07.741 --> 02:40:14.603]  But as we see this crunch that I started our conversation with, the crunch is getting stronger and stronger.
[02:40:15.183 --> 02:40:22.425]  And, you know, free speech and your rights, the Patriot Act, all of this getting us, I mean, we just have to rededicate here.
[02:40:23.521 --> 02:40:25.023]  We're selling a service.
[02:40:25.063 --> 02:40:25.983]  We offer a service.
[02:40:26.684 --> 02:40:28.805]  We sell it for what I think is a fair price.
[02:40:31.047 --> 02:40:33.769]  We try to do our best at every point.
[02:40:34.549 --> 02:40:38.913]  We offer high-speed DSL where the local telcos allow us.
[02:40:39.693 --> 02:40:41.935]  We're pretty much at their mercy, but we're trying our best.
[02:40:42.895 --> 02:40:44.996]  We offer high-speed internet.
[02:40:45.016 --> 02:40:46.517]  We offer high-speed dial-up.
[02:40:46.877 --> 02:40:56.342]  Now the Infowars.net, any Infowars.net regular dial-up internet customer will get free high-speed dial.
[02:40:56.683 --> 02:41:03.026]  Now, not to be confused with DSL, but that means we'll give you the free accelerator so that you can speed up your surfing and things like that.
[02:41:03.066 --> 02:41:06.268]  All you've got to do is shoot us an email and we'll get your account set up.
[02:41:06.388 --> 02:41:07.008]  Not a problem.
[02:41:07.931 --> 02:41:08.812]  That's one other thing.
[02:41:09.072 --> 02:41:15.778]  We've also just introduced and launched a brand new site called InfoWarsNetwork.com.
[02:41:16.318 --> 02:41:22.643]  InfoWarsNetwork.com is dedicated to privacy oriented web hosting.
[02:41:22.703 --> 02:41:28.588]  So if you want to build your own site or if you have a site and you're having privacy concerns or anything like that.
[02:41:28.608 --> 02:41:30.990]  Now understand folks, we don't sell your information.
[02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:32.891]  It is a network in and of itself.
[02:41:33.412 --> 02:41:36.074]  There is no censorship on free speech.
[02:41:36.514 --> 02:41:36.774]  Right.
[02:41:36.794 --> 02:41:37.014]  Right.
[02:41:37.254 --> 02:41:39.015]  We don't allow any of that.
[02:41:55.499 --> 02:42:03.106]  You want a site where there's zero censorship, this is the place to go, and it's high-quality service, folks, and it is a great deal.
[02:42:03.466 --> 02:42:06.169]  Tell folks about the different server packages.
[02:42:06.569 --> 02:42:11.113]  Everybody out there who has a website needs to move to InfoWarsNetwork.com.
[02:42:11.173 --> 02:42:12.855]  There's a link through at InfoWars.net.
[02:42:13.195 --> 02:42:14.056]  It's part of that.
[02:42:14.096 --> 02:42:15.837]  The two sites revolve around each other.
[02:42:16.438 --> 02:42:17.479]  You need to move there.
[02:42:17.519 --> 02:42:18.780]  You need to start your own site.
[02:42:18.820 --> 02:42:19.861]  It's very easy to do.
[02:42:20.181 --> 02:42:21.262]  Tell them about that, Dwayne.
[02:42:21.282 --> 02:42:21.662]  Sure, man.
[02:42:22.643 --> 02:42:26.324]  We have everything from a very basic hosting package, which you do it yourself.
[02:42:26.684 --> 02:42:31.406]  If you're already a webmaster, you pretty much know what you're doing, as low as $9.95 a month.
[02:42:31.566 --> 02:42:32.646]  There's no setup fee.
[02:42:33.327 --> 02:42:34.287]  It's set up online.
[02:42:34.847 --> 02:42:36.668]  You're set up the same minute you sign up.
[02:42:37.468 --> 02:42:37.988]  It starts at $9.95.
[02:42:38.128 --> 02:42:44.030]  If you don't know how to do this stuff, there's an easy website builder package for an extra $3, $12.95 a month.
[02:42:45.971 --> 02:42:52.754]  And you have an application that helps you build a website simply by pointing and clicking and filling in the blanks of information.
[02:42:52.794 --> 02:42:54.715]  You can make a really nice, attractive website.
[02:42:55.115 --> 02:43:05.320]  And that goes all the way up to an enterprise class website for $19.95 a month with 500 megs of storage, you know, 5 gigs of transfer, unlimited email addresses.
[02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:07.041]  It's just a wonderful deal.
[02:43:07.701 --> 02:43:13.264]  We have all kinds of free applications that can be installed on the server that can let you run discussion forums.
[02:43:14.024 --> 02:43:19.830]  You know, if you want to run your own bulletin board discussion forum, you need an e-commerce catalog for your business.
[02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:22.613]  All of these applications are already on the server.
[02:43:22.913 --> 02:43:28.659]  And folks, here's a reason to get your high-speed dial-up through us, your hyper-dial-up or your DSL through us.
[02:43:29.786 --> 02:43:36.210]  Or to have your server there, because the big companies, they regulate free, classic speech.
[02:43:36.490 --> 02:43:39.071]  Conservative speech, libertarian speech, liberal speech.
[02:43:39.512 --> 02:43:53.139]  They regulate anything that's outside the norm, but they accept the gambling, the hardcore porn, all of it, and the most of them give money to gun control groups, to groups getting rid of our borders, and you're there supporting those that are destroying this country.
[02:43:53.479 --> 02:44:06.442]  By going to InfoWars.net and signing up with InfoWarsNetwork.com, by being part of this, you support freedom, you're not censored, you're able to tell the truth, and have a great service.
[02:44:06.462 --> 02:44:13.003]  So I hope you'll go to InfoWars.net, and I hope you'll sign up today, folks, because it's amazing.
[02:44:13.043 --> 02:44:13.663]  Here's an example.
[02:44:13.723 --> 02:44:18.404]  I have a local cable modem, Roadrunner Time Warner, for my internet.
[02:44:19.404 --> 02:44:22.645]  And it goes down quite often, and I just go to my Rovinet account.
[02:44:22.685 --> 02:44:24.425]  That's what powersinfullwars.net.
[02:44:25.666 --> 02:44:28.807]  It's just, you know, clone services of what DeWayne offers, the very same system.
[02:44:29.887 --> 02:44:34.908]  And in the past, I'd have dial-up, and I would try to use it.
[02:44:34.988 --> 02:44:36.729]  Other companies, it just didn't work.
[02:44:36.889 --> 02:44:38.089]  It usually doesn't work.
[02:44:38.129 --> 02:44:38.689]  You can't serve.
[02:44:39.050 --> 02:44:41.470]  You go use DeWayne's numbers for dial-up.
[02:44:41.610 --> 02:44:43.111]  It always works great.
[02:44:43.231 --> 02:44:44.071]  Loads really quick.
[02:44:44.431 --> 02:44:45.871]  The fastest dial-up I've seen.
[02:44:46.191 --> 02:44:47.872]  DeWayne, how are you able to do that?
[02:44:48.587 --> 02:44:54.152]  Well, it's basically, you know, we see customers that have problems, too.
[02:44:54.172 --> 02:44:59.416]  I don't want to mislead anyone, but by and large, our ratios are much better.
[02:44:59.776 --> 02:45:01.558]  Our modem-to-user ratios.
[02:45:01.618 --> 02:45:06.682]  In other words, how many customers we sell per how many modems are waiting to answer their call.
[02:45:07.602 --> 02:45:13.565]  So what happens is the big dogs like AOL and others, they sell more packages than they even have modems.
[02:45:14.005 --> 02:45:14.706]  Right.
[02:45:14.826 --> 02:45:18.007]  And what happens is they sell unlimited access.
[02:45:18.267 --> 02:45:21.289]  And unlimited is a very squirrely term in the internet business.
[02:45:21.649 --> 02:45:22.989]  There's no such thing as unlimited.
[02:45:23.770 --> 02:45:28.492]  Unlimited, when you say unlimited internet, people think, my god, I can stay connected all the time.
[02:45:28.872 --> 02:45:32.434]  Well, unlimited internet looked at that way is like saying
[02:45:32.874 --> 02:45:34.655]  Uh, all you can eat salad bar.
[02:45:34.916 --> 02:45:40.740]  Okay, well you can go in and eat all you want, but you can't sit down and wait four hours until you get hungry again and then go eat some more.
[02:45:41.260 --> 02:45:45.963]  You know, I mean, there's of course, it's an interactive internet thing, so that, that, those are squirrely terms.
[02:45:46.004 --> 02:45:53.749]  And by the way, there's the, uh, you know, again, when you're out there surfing, there's this cloaking device, uh, so you're not being tracked.
[02:45:54.249 --> 02:45:55.630]  Yeah, the virtual browser, right.
[02:45:55.710 --> 02:45:57.712]  I mean, I mean, folks, there's so many... Come free with every account.
[02:45:58.052 --> 02:46:00.534]  Yeah, there's so many things, just, there's literally what,
[02:46:01.945 --> 02:46:04.086]  Hundreds of things that are offered there.
[02:46:04.467 --> 02:46:05.387]  It's a great deal.
[02:46:05.887 --> 02:46:09.349]  Infowars.net, link to Infowarsnetwork.com.
[02:46:09.970 --> 02:46:11.150]  Dwayne, let's take some calls.
[02:46:11.330 --> 02:46:11.591]  Sure.
[02:46:11.711 --> 02:46:14.212]  Michael in Georgia, thanks for holding, and Roger and others.
[02:46:14.252 --> 02:46:14.852]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:46:15.393 --> 02:46:18.754]  Hey, when I called Alex... Sorry, my mic was up.
[02:46:18.774 --> 02:46:21.436]  When I called Alex, I had other things on my mind.
[02:46:21.736 --> 02:46:27.519]  You do bring us a lot of great information, and Dwayne always is very enjoyable to listen to.
[02:46:27.539 --> 02:46:29.120]  I appreciate all the good information.
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:30.621]  What I was going to talk about was
[02:46:31.522 --> 02:46:38.888]  I've got some things with regard to Arnold Schwarzenegger that I discovered a long time ago, back about the end of 1990.
[02:46:38.948 --> 02:46:39.929]  Well, go ahead and discuss it.
[02:46:40.209 --> 02:46:40.450]  The end of 1990.
[02:46:41.450 --> 02:46:49.257]  My very first vision I ever had in my life, this guy comes up to me, he's got a Bible, and he says, did you know Arnold Schwarzenegger was the Antichrist?
[02:46:49.682 --> 02:46:50.703]  I said no, I did not.
[02:46:51.023 --> 02:46:55.627]  He said, well look right here, he opened the Bible, there were some red letters and it said Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Antichrist.
[02:46:55.867 --> 02:47:03.252]  Well I started doing some research on him then, this again is the end of 1990, and at that time... No, no, you called years ago.
[02:47:05.136 --> 02:47:08.919]  I remember your voice with a different name.
[02:47:08.979 --> 02:47:10.280]  You called yourself the Professor.
[02:47:10.541 --> 02:47:10.761]  Right.
[02:47:10.861 --> 02:47:12.282]  And you called up and you said this.
[02:47:12.402 --> 02:47:14.323]  And now they're lining it up and getting it ready.
[02:47:14.343 --> 02:47:18.126]  I don't want to say Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Antichrist, but he's certainly a Nazi.
[02:47:18.427 --> 02:47:19.287]  I know what he is now.
[02:47:19.788 --> 02:47:20.508]  That was a lie.
[02:47:20.588 --> 02:47:23.590]  I determined that that first vision that I had was from the devil.
[02:47:23.831 --> 02:47:25.912]  Listen, he's the Anti-Beast.
[02:47:25.952 --> 02:47:28.054]  He's going to go up against the Antichrist.
[02:47:28.536 --> 02:47:29.857]  Give the Antichrist validity.
[02:47:30.137 --> 02:47:37.461]  In other words, yeah, they're going to have this sleazy scumbag Nazi as our protector, and he's going to go up against the Antichrist, and the Antichrist will prevail.
[02:47:37.501 --> 02:47:38.541]  I know that sounds bizarre.
[02:47:38.561 --> 02:47:40.982]  So you think Arnold Schwarzenegger is the little horn?
[02:47:41.243 --> 02:47:42.543]  Yeah, he's going to be.
[02:47:42.623 --> 02:47:43.724]  This is really getting weird.
[02:47:44.004 --> 02:47:44.704]  Yeah, it's weird.
[02:47:44.824 --> 02:47:45.225]  It's weird.
[02:47:45.485 --> 02:47:47.446]  But his name means black darkness.
[02:47:47.526 --> 02:47:55.650]  Schwarzen, of course, means black, and Negger is from the Latin, nigger, which means, or where the word negro comes from, which means black.
[02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:57.511]  His very name means black darkness.
[02:47:58.067 --> 02:48:01.950]  And I was telling all my friends about it back in 1990, and they thought I was nuts.
[02:48:02.050 --> 02:48:02.570]  But here we are.
[02:48:28.327 --> 02:48:28.908]  Intentions.
[02:48:28.968 --> 02:48:30.909]  I know what his intentions are.
[02:48:31.170 --> 02:48:37.855]  Yeah, gun grabbing, open border promoting, abortion loving, stem cell promoting, uh, commie.
[02:48:40.057 --> 02:48:41.438]  So the Republicans love him, Dwayne.
[02:48:42.839 --> 02:48:43.540]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:44.100]  Take more calls.
[02:48:44.121 --> 02:48:44.541]  Stay with us.
[02:48:45.945 --> 02:48:47.466]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.646 --> 02:48:50.729]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.869 --> 02:48:54.772]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.812 --> 02:48:59.076]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.396 --> 02:49:03.179]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.259 --> 02:49:05.101]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.721 --> 02:49:08.603]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.663 --> 02:49:13.367]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.527 --> 02:49:16.569]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:49:16.749 --> 02:49:19.611]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.111 --> 02:49:26.216]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.756 --> 02:49:30.540]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:49:30.940 --> 02:49:32.322]  Order your video today.
[02:49:32.702 --> 02:49:33.703]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[02:49:35.785 --> 02:49:37.306]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:49:45.436 --> 02:49:50.662]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:50.822 --> 02:49:58.912]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.172 --> 02:50:06.220]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.161 --> 02:50:13.645]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:13.825 --> 02:50:18.949]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.049 --> 02:50:27.915]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:50:28.195 --> 02:50:31.478]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:50.678 --> 02:51:52.599]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:51:53.059 --> 02:51:55.900]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.101 --> 02:51:59.221]  Roger, Johnny, Kyle, I'm going to go to you quick.
[02:51:59.241 --> 02:52:00.462]  Dwayne Koos is our guest.
[02:52:01.402 --> 02:52:03.463]  Go check out Infowars.net today.
[02:52:04.503 --> 02:52:06.584]  Let's talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[02:52:06.624 --> 02:52:07.524]  Roger, go ahead, sir.
[02:52:07.725 --> 02:52:08.805]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[02:52:08.865 --> 02:52:15.127]  On that National ID Card Bill, I just want to quickly jam out the Capitol Hill switchboard number toll-free.
[02:52:16.228 --> 02:52:19.169]  I just spent like 20 minutes on the phone with Congressional aide there.
[02:52:19.870 --> 02:52:25.275]  Me and Dwayne, during the break, were just talking about that National ID card, and Dwayne said, yeah, they didn't even take that in the back door, man.
[02:52:25.295 --> 02:52:26.296]  That thing's on the front porch.
[02:52:26.536 --> 02:52:30.760]  Yeah, no, it's supposed to be the HR-10-something intelligence bill, right?
[02:52:30.921 --> 02:52:31.121]  Yeah.
[02:52:31.381 --> 02:52:31.521]  Yeah.
[02:52:31.821 --> 02:52:35.565]  Okay, now the toll-free is $806-ah, I scratched that.
[02:52:35.585 --> 02:52:36.306]  That's a bad number.
[02:52:36.846 --> 02:52:37.547]  Okay, the good one is $877-762-8762.
[02:52:37.567 --> 02:52:38.348]  Want to repeat that quick?
[02:52:38.428 --> 02:52:38.568]  Sure.
[02:52:46.033 --> 02:52:49.999]  877-762-8762 and God bless.
[02:52:51.882 --> 02:52:52.983]  Alright, thank you Roger.
[02:52:53.484 --> 02:52:57.751]  Yeah, I mean we need to... It's in conference folks, they've passed it.
[02:52:59.548 --> 02:53:01.530]  And Bush is going to sign it, and so will Kerry.
[02:53:02.210 --> 02:53:04.512]  Let's talk to Johnny in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:53:04.552 --> 02:53:05.193]  Go ahead, Johnny.
[02:53:05.453 --> 02:53:05.673]  Hi there.
[02:53:05.713 --> 02:53:06.173]  How's it going?
[02:53:06.233 --> 02:53:06.874]  First time caller.
[02:53:07.134 --> 02:53:07.474]  Welcome.
[02:53:08.395 --> 02:53:18.263]  I found you about two months ago, and I basically found out about this whole New World Order Illuminati situation that's been going on for a long time.
[02:53:19.043 --> 02:53:23.607]  And I've been peddling this 9-11 in plain sight video.
[02:53:23.627 --> 02:53:24.768]  I'm sure you've probably heard of it.
[02:53:25.188 --> 02:53:25.388]  Yes.
[02:53:26.465 --> 02:53:28.567]  And when I saw that, I was just floored.
[02:53:28.587 --> 02:53:32.229]  I mean, I had a feeling, but, you know, you don't know until you actually see the proof.
[02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:43.637]  And I've been telling people, and I've been talking what you're talking, and I just cannot get past them because they basically think that I'm a nut.
[02:53:44.272 --> 02:53:45.153]  You know, that's funny.
[02:53:45.193 --> 02:53:49.155]  I've done over 1,600 radio interviews and almost no one calls in and disagrees with me.
[02:53:49.175 --> 02:53:49.835]  Oh, I know.
[02:53:49.855 --> 02:53:53.277]  There are a bunch of AM and FM stations, mainstream people listening.
[02:53:53.297 --> 02:53:54.098]  They're not disagreeing.
[02:53:54.518 --> 02:53:54.798]  Oh, I know.
[02:53:54.818 --> 02:53:58.760]  There's nobody that disagrees with you, but the thing is... But then I talk to you and you say you're getting major heat.
[02:53:59.141 --> 02:54:01.622]  Dwayne, any comments on what Johnny's saying?
[02:54:03.947 --> 02:54:05.329]  I mean, I've been called negative.
[02:54:22.153 --> 02:54:22.733]  I've been called.
[02:54:22.753 --> 02:54:23.213]  Oh, I love this.
[02:54:23.274 --> 02:54:30.376]  It's like you get your leg chopped off and you're supposed to ignore it and not put a tourniquet around it because to admit your leg is chopped off is negative, Dwayne.
[02:54:30.957 --> 02:54:32.697]  Yes, it's all in the presentation.
[02:54:33.138 --> 02:54:38.480]  When you come at folks with gabs of information, it's never going to work.
[02:54:38.580 --> 02:54:40.941]  You have to go one concept at a time.
[02:54:41.662 --> 02:54:52.113]  One small concept, just like the world that was placed before you since birth and how you've learned is one concept at a time.
[02:54:52.413 --> 02:54:59.140]  You didn't sit down at five years old and learn everything that was taught to you in the first grade, in the first day.
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:00.620]  One concept out of it.
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:03.421]  It's the only way, or you could risk being called a kook.
[02:55:03.621 --> 02:55:07.543]  The only reason no one challenges Alex is because he knows his game.
[02:55:07.863 --> 02:55:09.963]  He knows his facts and he can back them up.
[02:55:10.163 --> 02:55:11.424]  Well thanks Dwayne, so do you.
[02:55:11.904 --> 02:55:12.944]  Listen, thanks for the call Johnny.
[02:55:12.964 --> 02:55:14.565]  Call me back tomorrow because I want to talk more about this.
[02:55:14.605 --> 02:55:20.587]  But look, what you've got to do here is, with people, you tell them the first time, they're not going to listen.
[02:55:20.607 --> 02:55:21.527]  But it's like a seed.
[02:55:22.107 --> 02:55:24.268]  And over time, it's going to grow.
[02:55:24.748 --> 02:55:26.449]  Last caller, Kyle in California.
[02:55:26.489 --> 02:55:27.149]  Kyle, go ahead.
[02:55:28.311 --> 02:55:29.751]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:55:30.492 --> 02:55:38.294]  I've got so much in common with a couple of your callers that Arnold Schwarzenegger's stuff resonated a little bit too closely, but I go on.
[02:55:38.714 --> 02:55:40.335]  Duane, first time I heard you, man.
[02:55:40.515 --> 02:55:41.055]  You're great.
[02:55:41.195 --> 02:55:44.376]  I appreciate the technological information.
[02:55:44.396 --> 02:55:45.236]  Well, bless your heart.
[02:55:45.276 --> 02:55:47.457]  We were talking, Alex, about me starting a column.
[02:55:48.097 --> 02:55:49.998]  So we'll get something out for you guys.
[02:55:50.118 --> 02:55:50.798]  I love your demeanor.
[02:55:50.838 --> 02:55:53.219]  But I'm also a Democracy Now!
[02:55:53.279 --> 02:55:57.100]  listener, and I love how people have different ears for different things.
[02:55:57.905 --> 02:56:03.907]  Um, on that show this morning, they were just basically saying that, um, Bush is more extreme than Pat Roberts.
[02:56:03.947 --> 02:56:07.889]  He actually said that he did not believe that there would be a casualty in Iraq.
[02:56:08.489 --> 02:56:12.690]  And he sat there with a, with a smug look on his face that freaked even Pat Roberts out.
[02:56:13.471 --> 02:56:21.393]  Um, after that, there's a, a book called Bush on the Couch, uh, detailing his psychology, his body language, his psychology.
[02:56:21.954 --> 02:56:25.915]  And I just, I don't know how much of this stuff is organized.
[02:56:26.579 --> 02:56:29.244]  Hey listen, unfortunately Kyle, we're out of time.
[02:56:29.525 --> 02:56:30.947]  Duane, thanks for joining us.
[02:56:30.988 --> 02:56:32.731]  We'll see you at InfoWars.net.
[02:56:33.192 --> 02:56:33.853]  Take care, folks.
