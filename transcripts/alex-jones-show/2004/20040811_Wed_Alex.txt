[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.420]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.121]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:09.981]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:11.442]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:13.082]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:17.423]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.923 --> 00:00:22.025]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:40.432]  All right, my friends, it's already Wednesday, the 11th day of August, 2004.
[00:00:41.192 --> 00:00:42.993]  Thank you so much for joining me.
[00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:51.458]  Masses of vital news and information today, and an important guest discussing the vaccine situation in the second hour.
[00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:52.999]  Wide open phones.
[00:00:53.479 --> 00:01:00.824]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and of course, InfoWars.com.
[00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.110]  A lot of the same news and information on all the sites.
[00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.471]  A lot of different news on the sites.
[00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:09.472]  So check them all out today.
[00:01:10.312 --> 00:01:16.535]  Well, we already knew this, but CIA halted a plan to kidnap Bin Laden in 1998.
[00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:20.296]  Another example.
[00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:22.898]  Three separate countries wanted to arrest him.
[00:01:22.938 --> 00:01:25.739]  They said no, and then cruise missiled those that wanted to do it.
[00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.169]  Two of the countries that wanted to.
[00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:30.877]  Here they are protecting them.
[00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:35.669]  A Pakistani mole was about to blow Al-Qaeda wide open and so our government outed the mole.
[00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:38.973]  They do this over and over again.
[00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:43.714]  When they've got bin Laden cornered, special forces colonels told to stand down.
[00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:44.434]  He watches.
[00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:55.578]  It's over a hundred, quote, this is the San Francisco Chronicle, black helicopters land and pick up al-Qaeda and fly them to safety to C-130s, but then be flown out and paid handsomely by the U.S.
[00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:56.838]  government for a job well done.
[00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:59.199]  This has all come out.
[00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.520]  It all comes out in the news.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.660]  It's all out in the open.
[00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:05.569]  But, again, no one puts the pieces of the puzzle together.
[00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.809]  This is one of those puzzles a two-year-old could put together.
[00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.810]  You know, a puzzle that's maybe got like four pieces.
[00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:15.071]  You'd have to be brain-dead not to put the pieces together.
[00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:19.132]  CIA halted a plan to kidnap Bin Laden in 1998.
[00:02:19.332 --> 00:02:22.533]  That's out of the Irish Examiner, a big mainstream newspaper in Ireland.
[00:02:23.714 --> 00:02:25.654]  President Bush continues to surrender U.S.
[00:02:25.714 --> 00:02:27.294]  sovereignty to international entities.
[00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:29.095]  We'll go over Chuck Baldwin's great column.
[00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.352]  Also, documents uncovered proving U.S.
[00:02:33.372 --> 00:02:36.354]  doctors aided torturers in Abu Ghraib.
[00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:37.695]  We'll get into that.
[00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:45.522]  Kerry, an amazing statement yesterday that he supports Bush in the war, even if no weapons of mass destruction were there, he thinks it's a great war.
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.321]  Of course, the Democrats will suddenly love the war now.
[00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:51.861]  As soon as Kerry's in office, if he gets into office, Patriot Act, they'll love it.
[00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:52.842]  Wars, they'll love it.
[00:02:53.242 --> 00:02:54.282]  Same stuff will happen.
[00:02:54.302 --> 00:02:55.582]  Suddenly the left wing will love it.
[00:02:55.923 --> 00:02:58.183]  And conservatives are all committed to this lie.
[00:02:58.903 --> 00:03:01.224]  Mainstream, dumbbell, neocon conservatives.
[00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:03.485]  So they'll all be one happy enslaved family.
[00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:07.666]  And Bush laughed at Kerry yesterday and said, see, he agrees with me.
[00:03:08.226 --> 00:03:12.707]  He reveled in it as he mocked Kerry over, as he mocked his cousin.
[00:03:14.102 --> 00:03:17.803]  Bush's job rating falls to new low.
[00:03:18.743 --> 00:03:22.024]  Immigration plan envisions incentives to illegal aliens.
[00:03:22.304 --> 00:03:23.204]  We talked about this.
[00:03:23.724 --> 00:03:27.685]  It's finally being pointed out that they're going to pay to bring the illegal aliens here.
[00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:29.545]  Bush says it's not an amnesty, though.
[00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:35.626]  It's just the biggest amnesty ever, in perpetuity, dwarfing anything ever even conceived of.
[00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:39.547]  And corporations can pay to bring the illegals here to accelerate all this.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.704]  And they're going to advertise to get them here with the benefits.
[00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:46.965]  6 billion people globally.
[00:03:48.606 --> 00:03:49.787]  290 million in America.
[00:03:50.408 --> 00:03:55.352]  And our government's going to advertise in newspapers globally, please come to America, we'll pay you, please come here.
[00:03:55.372 --> 00:03:57.373]  Drive down the wages, help enslave us.
[00:03:58.074 --> 00:03:58.354]  U.S.
[00:03:58.394 --> 00:04:01.176]  will let Mexican visitors stay 30 days instead of 3.
[00:04:02.277 --> 00:04:06.281]  So helping have that wide open, no need to cross the desert, you can just walk right in.
[00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:09.063]  Scientists giving cloning a go ahead.
[00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:12.225]  This out of the BBC over in England.
[00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:14.565]  Iran to test missile capable of hitting Israel.
[00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:17.646]  Look for Iran to get hit pretty quick.
[00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:18.526]  U.S.
[00:04:18.546 --> 00:04:20.106]  to give Border Patrol new powers.
[00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.466]  The poor illegals, you know, right?
[00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:24.087]  Judge, removal of Bible from courthouse.
[00:04:24.147 --> 00:04:25.547]  Can't swear on that Bible.
[00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:27.408]  Can't have that Bible in the courthouse.
[00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:31.208]  Also CBS newsman Mike Wallace issued subpoena.
[00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:32.629]  Actually arrested.
[00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:38.330]  And just so much more lined up

[00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:21.265]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:27.751]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:29.112]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.432 --> 00:05:32.396]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.556 --> 00:05:34.578]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.

[00:06:10.172 --> 00:06:21.456]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:24.297]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.657 --> 00:06:31.125]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:31.285 --> 00:06:33.147]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.347 --> 00:06:39.374]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:45.281]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:10.150]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.654]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.694 --> 00:07:16.056]  The New World Order.

[00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:16.705]  Back from 9 to midnight Central.
[00:08:16.745 --> 00:08:17.666]  We're here, my friends.

[00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.340]  I know we have a caller from Japan.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:44.142]  We get calls from Japan and Australia, from McMurdle Weather Station in Antarctica, as we've gotten calls from there.
[00:08:44.182 --> 00:08:46.263]  We go to those calls directly.
[00:08:46.623 --> 00:08:52.686]  So we'll get to your call from Japan here in a few minutes, then Darren in California, and John in Ohio, and many, many others.
[00:08:53.106 --> 00:08:56.307]  We have a guest coming on in the next hour concerning mercury and the vaccines.
[00:08:57.088 --> 00:08:58.571]  And much, much more.
[00:08:59.051 --> 00:09:00.654]  So please stay with us.
[00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:02.538]  But let me get into the news now.
[00:09:02.558 --> 00:09:06.705]  I mean, we got Kerry saying the war is wonderful, even if there never were weapons of mass destruction.
[00:09:07.066 --> 00:09:07.988]  He's all for it.
[00:09:09.407 --> 00:09:16.632]  We've got more news surfacing about the government blowing the whistle on its own mole, and they were about to bust Al-Syiada.
[00:09:17.233 --> 00:09:18.934]  And so this is a good place to start.
[00:09:18.994 --> 00:09:32.703]  The Irish Examiner, a very respected newspaper, one of the national newspapers in Ireland, headline, we were actually already aware of this, but now it's mainstream news, CIA halted a plan to kidnap bin Laden in 1998.
[00:09:32.803 --> 00:09:35.465]  Now again, in case you didn't know this,
[00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:38.714]  Our government put Fidel Castro in publicly.
[00:09:38.954 --> 00:09:40.935]  They called him the Abraham Lincoln of the Caribbean.
[00:09:41.635 --> 00:09:43.617]  Our government put Manuel Noriega in.
[00:09:43.657 --> 00:09:44.998]  Our government put Saddam in.
[00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:47.059]  Our government put Mao in.
[00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:47.919]  You didn't know that?
[00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:49.200]  It's now admitted History Channel.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:49.981]  CIA admits it.
[00:09:50.681 --> 00:09:52.002]  They put all these people in!
[00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:54.824]  And this is no different.
[00:09:54.884 --> 00:09:59.307]  Bin Laden's family has been serving the British since at least 1918 as part of British Intelligence.
[00:09:59.827 --> 00:10:02.809]  They were the muscle family to install the House of Saud.
[00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.151]  And they've always been there.
[00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.133]  They've always served well.
[00:10:07.753 --> 00:10:10.035]  And they've been serving well again.
[00:10:10.055 --> 00:10:12.016]  And they'll continue to serve well.
[00:10:12.857 --> 00:10:17.880]  And Bin Laden was used to attack the Soviets in the 80s, which I don't think was bad.
[00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:22.583]  And then he was used to attack the Serbs in the late 90s, which was bad, when they fought back.
[00:10:22.684 --> 00:10:23.444]  Oh, they're evil demons.
[00:10:23.464 --> 00:10:24.525]  Let's go take their land.
[00:10:24.905 --> 00:10:25.566]  That's admitted.
[00:10:25.686 --> 00:10:26.506]  Senate report.
[00:10:26.947 --> 00:10:27.887]  By the Republicans.
[00:10:27.987 --> 00:10:28.748]  Alfonso D'Amato.
[00:10:30.314 --> 00:10:31.816]  And so now we have this.
[00:10:31.976 --> 00:10:36.220]  When the Sudanese wanted to arrest him and get some money, they got cruise missiles.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.562]  When the Afghans wanted to arrest him, they got cruise missiles.
[00:10:38.922 --> 00:10:42.185]  When they offered to give all the documents on the lot and over, they got cruise missiles.
[00:10:42.526 --> 00:10:46.770]  The leader, the religious leader of the Taliban, who wasn't CIA, stayed behind when we took over.
[00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.132]  And he was the first to be arrested, the only senior Taliban to be held.
[00:10:50.753 --> 00:10:53.835]  And he told the British Embassy, the Egyptian Embassy, the U.S.
[00:10:53.895 --> 00:10:56.116]  Embassy, you're going to be attacked, this is what's going to happen.
[00:10:56.637 --> 00:10:59.018]  And he was whiting there thinking he'd be loved with open arms.
[00:10:59.078 --> 00:10:59.859]  He was arrested.
[00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:01.200]  That came out in mainstream news.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.841]  The average person has no idea it even happened.
[00:11:04.062 --> 00:11:04.662]  Same story.
[00:11:04.682 --> 00:11:07.164]  And we have dozens and dozens and dozens of examples of this.
[00:11:07.544 --> 00:11:11.987]  CIA protecting Bin Laden in the 9-11 archive of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:12.587 --> 00:11:14.469]  Smaller archive at Infowars.com.
[00:11:15.732 --> 00:11:18.794]  CI halted a plan to kidnap Bin Laden in 98.
[00:11:18.974 --> 00:11:33.681]  In 98, the now-retired CI head George Sennett called off a brave plan to abduct Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden from an Afghan compound, fearing that it was too dangerous to implement according to a report into the September 11th terror attack.
[00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.762]  So, that's just the whitewash, folks.
[00:11:36.822 --> 00:11:39.924]  We have BBC and London Telegraph articles from 2000
[00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:47.906]  where british ambassadors were in northern pakistan and saw bin laden being guarded quote by u.s.
[00:11:47.926 --> 00:11:51.632]  special forces and they went wow he's there they've got him
[00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:54.087]  I mean, this is a joke.
[00:11:54.367 --> 00:12:03.451]  Agents set a plan to kidnap Bin Laden from a farm in Kandahar and then transport him to New York or a place where he could be put on trial.
[00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:08.154]  But Tenet decided to halt the plan amid fears that it might harm many U.S.
[00:12:08.174 --> 00:12:08.734]  civilians.
[00:12:09.274 --> 00:12:15.417]  The plan was devised based on satellite imagery and intelligence about a walled compound near Karnak Farms.
[00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:16.798]  They'll capture a plan before 9-11
[00:12:18.087 --> 00:12:21.649]  Ever again attain the same level of detail and preparation the report sets.
[00:12:21.689 --> 00:12:22.730]  This is just the whitewash.
[00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.992]  Working level CIA officers were disappointed when the plan was axed at it.
[00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:28.793]  I know Paul Watson's listening.
[00:12:28.853 --> 00:12:32.215]  Paul, you gotta find that London Telegraph article that was another one.
[00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:46.962]  You've got to get that BBC article, you've got to get that article out of the San Francisco Chronicle where that special forces colonel described having the Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders, the Arab fighters, cornered and then they were ordered to stand down and they watched U.S.
[00:12:47.002 --> 00:12:48.664]  helicopters land and lift them off.
[00:12:49.805 --> 00:12:50.826]  I know that's in the archives.
[00:12:50.866 --> 00:12:57.533]  We need to post that, have a little news and focus section for the next few days and repost that for people.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:05.602]  There was also another general who said that they would capture Taliban and Al-Qaeda generals, they'd be ordered to release them with vehicles and let them go.
[00:13:05.622 --> 00:13:08.083]  I think that was MSNBC.
[00:13:08.103 --> 00:13:15.626]  I need to post all this, because this isn't just some little accidental thing here.
[00:13:16.106 --> 00:13:22.448]  The plan was for Bin Laden to be snatched by a group of Afghan operatives and handed to a group of tribal leaders in the desert outside Kandahar.
[00:13:23.642 --> 00:13:28.144]  Then they would turn Bin Laden over to another group of leaders who would then hand him over to the CIA.
[00:13:28.204 --> 00:13:32.366]  But unfortunately the plan was halted and that for a number of reasons made by Tenet.
[00:13:32.766 --> 00:13:34.107]  And this is just one of the times.
[00:13:34.267 --> 00:13:38.648]  Then the Afghans wanted to arrest him in 2000, 2001.
[00:13:39.989 --> 00:13:41.009]  But that was not allowed.
[00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:44.791]  Then he went for kidney dialysis at the American Hospital in Dubai.
[00:13:44.811 --> 00:13:47.112]  A big military base, U.S.
[00:13:47.152 --> 00:13:49.473]  military base, and the CIA met with him for 10 days.
[00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.331]  So that's, again, that's just a small portion of the facts.
[00:13:53.931 --> 00:13:57.012]  Let's just go to calls now, and we'll get to all the other news here in a few minutes.
[00:13:57.512 --> 00:14:00.173]  Michael in Japan, I guess an American living in Japan.
[00:14:00.753 --> 00:14:01.593]  Michael, how you doing?
[00:14:03.154 --> 00:14:04.014]  Alex, how are you?
[00:14:04.334 --> 00:14:06.215]  Good, so you listen to us in Japan?
[00:14:06.655 --> 00:14:08.536]  Yes, sir, on the internet.
[00:14:08.636 --> 00:14:11.557]  I've been listening to you for a little more than a year now.
[00:14:13.743 --> 00:14:19.666]  I wanted to tell you, I ordered four of your videos, and I have a small complaint about them.
[00:14:20.106 --> 00:14:22.167]  It's not the material in them.
[00:14:22.847 --> 00:14:32.812]  I ordered them, and when I put one of them in the VCR, I got no video, and the audio sounds like you're on 78-speed.
[00:14:34.033 --> 00:14:35.914]  Well, we get that with foreign governments.
[00:14:36.354 --> 00:14:40.096]  Japan has some of the highest restrictions around stuff that goes into Canada,
[00:14:40.937 --> 00:14:50.846]  Uh, tends to get erased or smashed and we've had big problems with Japan and I'm glad we can handle your customer service issue here on air.
[00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:55.529]  It's not a complaint against you Alex.
[00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.612]  All you have to do sir, well just let me stop you.
[00:14:58.692 --> 00:15:03.136]  We'll be glad to send those back out to you again and if they get erased again we'll send them out again and again.
[00:15:03.972 --> 00:15:15.757]  Okay, because I have not lived in the road to tyranny, and I've shown it to a friend of mine who's retired military.
[00:15:16.197 --> 00:15:20.419]  He couldn't believe what was on the DVD.
[00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:25.721]  He couldn't believe it, but I'm thinking, well, he shows you the mainstream articles, they're right there.
[00:15:25.981 --> 00:15:30.343]  Oh good, so of the four videos, how many of them worked for you?
[00:15:31.247 --> 00:15:31.667]  None of them.
[00:15:31.968 --> 00:15:34.129]  I put them all in the VCR.
[00:15:34.209 --> 00:15:36.911]  I even bought a new VCR and nothing happened.
[00:15:37.711 --> 00:15:40.413]  We might have one bad video out of 200 that's our fault.
[00:15:40.713 --> 00:15:42.014]  They were all a race, sir.
[00:15:42.654 --> 00:15:47.097]  Somebody put a demagnetizer to them, yeah.
[00:15:47.177 --> 00:15:47.637]  Yeah.
[00:15:47.677 --> 00:15:53.581]  When they send them through those radiation machines, I don't know if Japan has those, but New Jersey and places are doing it.
[00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:54.482]  It totally fries them.
[00:15:55.382 --> 00:15:56.703]  So only the DVD made it.
[00:15:57.401 --> 00:15:58.382]  Oh, yeah.
[00:15:58.502 --> 00:15:59.483]  The DVD works fine.
[00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:01.145]  I've got a... Listen, do this, Michael.
[00:16:01.405 --> 00:16:03.447]  Michael, just contact us and we'll send you some more.
[00:16:04.007 --> 00:16:04.588]  Okay, that's great.
[00:16:04.608 --> 00:16:05.649]  Let me give you the number to do that.
[00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:06.609]  Let me give you the number to do that.
[00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.990]  5-1.
[00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:07.150]  5-1-2.
[00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:07.630]  Hey, wait a second.
[00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:07.931]  5-1-2.
[00:16:07.951 --> 00:16:07.991]  5-1-2.
[00:16:08.071 --> 00:16:09.712]  It's on the website, too.
[00:16:09.732 --> 00:16:09.892]  5-1-2-2-9-1-5-7-50.
[00:16:09.972 --> 00:16:10.213]  Okay, 5-7-50.
[00:16:10.233 --> 00:16:11.093]  Uh-huh.
[00:16:11.194 --> 00:16:12.675]  Or you can call 888.
[00:16:24.392 --> 00:16:24.972]  Yes, sir.
[00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:26.453]  I've been pretty angry.
[00:16:26.473 --> 00:16:28.514]  I could use stronger language, but I'm not.
[00:16:45.854 --> 00:16:53.660]  I am, but I read on the MSNBC that I heard that Porter Goss is going to be the new CIA Director.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.201]  Yeah, we were going to cover that in a minute.
[00:16:55.221 --> 00:17:00.565]  The guy who met with the Pakistani General, and we're going to go over all that evidence of this little, uh, this spook.
[00:17:01.205 --> 00:17:02.586]  Yeah, yeah, give me a break.
[00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:03.126]  Come on.
[00:17:03.467 --> 00:17:05.968]  I know, I've been reading up on that.
[00:17:05.988 --> 00:17:07.970]  I was like, oh my, no, you're telling me.
[00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.111]  Well, what do you do over in Japan?
[00:17:11.052 --> 00:17:15.255]  Uh, well, I, um, I'm an English teacher, and, uh,
[00:17:16.841 --> 00:17:24.187]  And I keep telling everybody about you, and I keep telling about the information that you're telling.
[00:17:24.207 --> 00:17:25.428]  What do you do in Japan?
[00:17:25.528 --> 00:17:26.829]  I mean, where do you live?
[00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:28.470]  I live in Zama.
[00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.752]  There's a town called Zama.
[00:17:30.832 --> 00:17:35.075]  It's about, I'd say about 25 miles outside of Tokyo.
[00:17:35.475 --> 00:17:35.696]  Yes.
[00:17:37.984 --> 00:17:42.346]  There's a military base about maybe two blocks down from where I live.
[00:17:42.426 --> 00:17:54.331]  Well, I get a lot of emails from Japan and I'm being interviewed by one Japanese TV station today, next week by another network, and it seems like, I forget, it seems like Japan is really waking up.
[00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:59.053]  Well, yeah, especially, you know, especially me.
[00:17:59.974 --> 00:18:00.194]  Actually,
[00:18:07.004 --> 00:18:08.684]  I apologize, I'm a little nervous here.
[00:18:08.724 --> 00:18:09.284]  That's okay.
[00:18:09.765 --> 00:18:14.065]  Well listen, Michael, it's good to talk to you and thanks for your support and take care, my friend.
[00:18:14.325 --> 00:18:14.926]  Yes, sir.
[00:18:15.046 --> 00:18:15.386]  You bet.
[00:18:15.706 --> 00:18:20.146]  Caller from Japan, Darren in California, a little bit closer to home.
[00:18:20.527 --> 00:18:22.467]  Darren, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:18:23.707 --> 00:18:24.847]  Darren's gone, alright.
[00:18:25.207 --> 00:18:27.028]  John in Ohio, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:33.829]  Yes, you mentioned how people get profiled by their supposed tribal team.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:40.403]  Identification of Democrats and Republicans, and how now Kerry, you know, is supporting this dirty war and occupation.
[00:18:40.843 --> 00:18:48.927]  And I think that's the technique that is used by the neocons to, in effect, say, well, now I've got an emotional stake in it.
[00:18:48.987 --> 00:18:53.809]  I voted for this guy, whether he's a Democrat or a Republican, so I've got to support their dirty war crimes.
[00:18:54.469 --> 00:19:00.272]  But I see the same kind of profiling going on among conservatives and right-wingers.
[00:19:00.292 --> 00:19:01.433]  I have to say that.
[00:19:01.453 --> 00:19:04.254]  And I don't think I'd have enough time or ability
[00:19:04.824 --> 00:19:33.381]  To state what I'm trying to get at, but if you could have somebody on like Dr. Michael Parenti, michaelparenti.com, I think he could do a better job than I could, because I worry that despite all your keen analysis of the evil motives and lies of these Neocon warmongers, and their PNAC schemes, or world domination, starting with their appetizers, along countries like Iraq and Iran,
[00:19:34.013 --> 00:19:44.139]  That when they move to phase two of the PNAC plan, which according to their own PNAC blueprint plans... Is Russia and China.
[00:19:44.159 --> 00:19:46.901]  Could I hold on after the break?
[00:19:46.921 --> 00:19:47.301]  Yeah, sure.
[00:19:47.321 --> 00:19:48.562]  I know where you're going with this.
[00:19:49.162 --> 00:19:49.522]  Stay there.
[00:19:49.542 --> 00:19:50.383]  You can finish up, John.
[00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:52.024]  We'll go to others at 800-259-9231.
[00:19:52.104 --> 00:19:53.785]  And again, the website is PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:19:53.805 --> 00:19:54.945]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:02.283]  Terrorism!
[00:20:02.423 --> 00:20:03.183]  Terrorism!
[00:20:03.283 --> 00:20:09.347]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:20:09.607 --> 00:20:11.188]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:20:11.428 --> 00:20:13.930]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:28.879]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:28.919 --> 00:20:29.219]  government.
[00:20:29.399 --> 00:20:31.220]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:37.484]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:20:37.624 --> 00:20:42.147]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[00:20:42.387 --> 00:20:48.050]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:49.851]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:51.793]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:21:00.732 --> 00:21:02.254]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:21:02.434 --> 00:21:03.556]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:21:03.736 --> 00:21:07.161]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:07.261 --> 00:21:07.681]  Phenol!
[00:21:08.002 --> 00:21:15.091]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:21:15.572 --> 00:21:19.516]  ETA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:19.616 --> 00:21:20.076]  Fragrance?
[00:21:20.457 --> 00:21:25.221]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:25.341 --> 00:21:30.046]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:21:30.266 --> 00:21:32.829]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[00:21:33.069 --> 00:21:36.492]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:21:36.632 --> 00:21:40.156]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:21:40.376 --> 00:21:42.738]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:21:42.898 --> 00:21:43.779]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:21:43.899 --> 00:21:53.647]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:22:00.839 --> 00:22:05.544]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:22:05.804 --> 00:22:09.227]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:22:09.447 --> 00:22:11.910]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:16.054]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking,
[00:22:16.274 --> 00:22:20.739]  It's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:26.946]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[00:22:27.166 --> 00:22:29.148]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[00:22:29.368 --> 00:22:36.296]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[00:22:36.636 --> 00:22:43.078]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[00:22:43.358 --> 00:22:50.720]  That's right, for a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.381]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[00:22:55.482 --> 00:22:55.722]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:55.742 --> 00:22:57.342]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[00:23:00.823 --> 00:23:03.646]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:23:03.767 --> 00:23:04.608]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:23:04.728 --> 00:23:08.032]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:23:08.212 --> 00:23:13.878]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:23:14.018 --> 00:23:17.042]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:23:17.302 --> 00:23:21.565]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:23:21.766 --> 00:23:23.667]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[00:23:23.787 --> 00:23:30.853]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:23:31.053 --> 00:23:33.515]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:23:33.815 --> 00:23:36.498]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[00:23:36.638 --> 00:23:38.139]  Only this time, it changed my life.
[00:23:38.419 --> 00:23:40.181]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[00:23:40.261 --> 00:23:42.383]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[00:23:42.543 --> 00:23:45.005]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[00:23:45.045 --> 00:23:47.748]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[00:23:47.928 --> 00:23:48.468]  Side effects?
[00:23:48.648 --> 00:23:50.931]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[00:23:51.071 --> 00:23:52.552]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[00:23:52.592 --> 00:23:52.812]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:23:52.892 --> 00:23:54.173]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[00:23:54.214 --> 00:23:54.854]  It worked for me.
[00:24:11.127 --> 00:24:21.134]  All right, I'm going to get into Porter Goss, the ultra slimeball to be your new CIA director, and how that ties into the new super CIA that's going to be running our lives like the KGB.
[00:24:22.895 --> 00:24:30.020]  And we'll get into Kerry's disgusting activities saying, oh, he loves the war and doesn't care if there weren't weapons of mass destruction.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:36.804]  And look at all that moral authority he's giving Bush, his cousin, his business partner, his buddy from Skull and Bones.
[00:24:37.205 --> 00:24:38.405]  This is totally staged.
[00:24:39.166 --> 00:24:40.747]  And this is how they give us false choices.
[00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.171]  So we'll be discussing that.
[00:24:43.211 --> 00:24:44.712]  I'm sure that's what John wants to talk about.
[00:24:44.732 --> 00:24:46.012]  But I know where John's going with this.
[00:24:46.372 --> 00:24:49.034]  PNAC wants to attack North Korea, China, Russia.
[00:24:49.114 --> 00:24:50.274]  Total World War III.
[00:24:50.595 --> 00:24:53.216]  That's on the battle plan after they take over the Middle East.
[00:24:53.656 --> 00:24:57.078]  A new national draft to get that done after they've armed China and the rest of them.
[00:24:57.638 --> 00:24:59.479]  I don't think they're going to go to war with China and Russia.
[00:24:59.499 --> 00:25:01.060]  I think they're going to be more posturing.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.262]  The Fortune 500 basically runs China and Russia today.
[00:25:06.362 --> 00:25:08.323]  Russia has six oligarchs in charge.
[00:25:08.343 --> 00:25:12.285]  Every time one of them gets arrested, it turns out it's some Dutch or British or U.S.
[00:25:12.305 --> 00:25:15.506]  company that really owns whole sectors of the Russian economy.
[00:25:15.826 --> 00:25:18.648]  It was our big banks that put the Communists into power, folks.
[00:25:19.228 --> 00:25:22.710]  And that's where John and myself disagree.
[00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.631]  John doesn't know his history.
[00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:25.491]  John, go ahead.
[00:25:26.209 --> 00:25:41.654]  Well, I think I do to some degree, but I think that this is the most dangerous phase of the PNEC blueprint for world domination and setting up a fourth Reich, because they do say that any country that is an obstacle towards total domination
[00:25:42.199 --> 00:26:09.235]  who are the uh... washington military-industrial a washington-based military-industrial complex is going to get a job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job job
[00:26:09.862 --> 00:26:20.637]  If they change the label from an anti-terror war to an anti-communist war, they will have effectively profiled many right wing... Hey, your little buddies are a bunch of Trotskyites, John!
[00:26:22.037 --> 00:26:26.119]  My buddies are simply people that I've examined over decades.
[00:26:26.199 --> 00:26:32.843]  I know, but you've called them before, and you think socialism's great, and I'm telling you it's a creation of the elite to con the people back into serfdom.
[00:26:33.263 --> 00:26:38.386]  Well, you know, if that were the case, there wouldn't have been a 14-capitalist country.
[00:26:38.426 --> 00:26:40.127]  Hey, John, you look at this corrupt
[00:26:40.757 --> 00:26:44.799]  Fascist state, and you think, oh my gosh, socialism must be good.
[00:26:45.259 --> 00:26:48.220]  We don't even understand that real free market is a great thing.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.241]  This is organized crime we're fighting.
[00:26:50.421 --> 00:26:53.002]  So don't look at organized crime and think free market's bad.
[00:26:53.202 --> 00:26:54.442]  This isn't free market, sir.
[00:26:54.743 --> 00:26:57.964]  You know who lobbies for regulation and big government?
[00:26:58.144 --> 00:26:59.084]  The corporations do.
[00:26:59.324 --> 00:27:00.505]  They use it and control it.
[00:27:00.985 --> 00:27:05.051]  Well, I understand that, but what I'm talking about... Well, the socialists give them a bigger mechanism of control!
[00:27:05.071 --> 00:27:08.475]  No, I'm not talking about that kind of mechanism of control.
[00:27:08.615 --> 00:27:16.766]  I'm just saying that the countries that are in the bomb sites and the gun sites of these mad, forthright neocons
[00:27:17.239 --> 00:27:27.229]  Like Cuba, Venezuela, these countries around the world, I think, can be attacked with the recruiting of right-wingers and conservatives because... Let me ask you a question.
[00:27:27.249 --> 00:27:37.559]  Do you believe that Fidel... Do you know the historical... Sir, the historical fact that Eisenhower called Fidel the Abraham Lincoln of the Caribbean?
[00:27:38.228 --> 00:27:46.756]  Well, you know, I don't know that, but I do know that whenever North was just mentioned, you never mentioned that the main victim and target of that was Cuba.
[00:27:46.796 --> 00:27:50.600]  They were to be framed up, but it was Eisenhower that framed them up.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.201]  Sir, it's in my film.
[00:27:52.221 --> 00:27:53.462]  What do you mean I never mentioned it?
[00:27:53.522 --> 00:27:54.143]  It's in my video.
[00:27:54.648 --> 00:27:56.870]  You never mentioned the name of Cuba.
[00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:00.592]  You mentioned enemies of the globalists.
[00:28:00.792 --> 00:28:06.276]  Precisely because it would impose... Sir, you haven't seen the Road to Tyranny, have you?
[00:28:06.556 --> 00:28:07.977]  But I've listened to your program.
[00:28:07.997 --> 00:28:09.278]  You haven't seen the video, have you?
[00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:10.119]  No, I haven't.
[00:28:10.159 --> 00:28:11.340]  But I've listened to it.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:12.461]  John, thanks for the call.
[00:28:12.561 --> 00:28:13.601]  We've got a lot of other callers.
[00:28:14.382 --> 00:28:17.004]  Look, this is why we're going to lose this country and the planet.
[00:28:17.884 --> 00:28:21.007]  Because the Democrats think Gary's great because he's got a D before his name.
[00:28:21.447 --> 00:28:24.129]  The Republicans think Bush is great because he's got an R before his name.
[00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:29.853]  And I personally think Kerry would be better because it will wake conservatives up out of this doldrum.
[00:28:31.033 --> 00:28:35.475]  Not because he's good, but because they'll quit being blind to what's happening in this country.
[00:28:36.536 --> 00:28:37.196]  But who knows?
[00:28:37.296 --> 00:28:38.817]  I mean, they'll probably think Kerry's great.
[00:28:39.577 --> 00:28:40.078]  Who knows?
[00:28:41.478 --> 00:28:43.279]  Conservatives will probably go along with Kerry.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.721]  I mean, it's just like beating your head up against a wall.
[00:28:48.182 --> 00:28:52.384]  It is a historical fact that our government put in Mao Zedong
[00:28:53.058 --> 00:29:09.347]  That they put in Lennon, that they put in, that they helped support Ho Chi Minh, Pol Pot, Fidel Castro, Manuel Noriega, Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, that they were even involved in supporting Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:29:09.847 --> 00:29:14.130]  They set them up, then they try to knock them down so they can have weapons sales.
[00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.032]  And you guys want to romanticize the Reds and the rest of it.
[00:29:19.072 --> 00:29:21.814]  The Reds killed tens of millions of people.
[00:29:23.417 --> 00:29:31.720]  And how you could ever look at one evil of the neocons and then try to mirror that and say, oh, but commies are going to say this.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.061]  Now can the neocons use anti-communist rhetoric to push their agenda?
[00:29:36.121 --> 00:29:36.901]  Of course they can!
[00:29:37.201 --> 00:29:39.022]  While at the same time supporting communists.
[00:29:40.942 --> 00:29:44.343]  So, you just can't grow up, John.
[00:29:45.004 --> 00:29:47.464]  You just can't get your head out of the sand, buddy.
[00:29:47.925 --> 00:29:49.265]  You can't break your paradigm.
[00:29:51.633 --> 00:29:54.637]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.538 --> 00:29:58.241]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.012 --> 00:30:03.013]  It's finally here!
[00:30:03.153 --> 00:30:04.154]  Spring has arrived!
[00:30:04.314 --> 00:30:07.277]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:30:07.497 --> 00:30:10.960]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:19.327]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[00:32:01.488 --> 00:32:02.909]  Somebody wants to sue you.

[00:33:38.476 --> 00:33:48.140]  We're back live.

[00:33:50.821 --> 00:33:54.823]  We'll go to Anthony and Peter and Ken and many, many others here in a few minutes.
[00:33:54.863 --> 00:33:55.823]  Let me cover more news.
[00:33:55.863 --> 00:33:59.125]  I went to calls early in the broadcast to try to change the pace a bit.
[00:34:00.177 --> 00:34:01.298]  Need to cover news right now.
[00:34:01.838 --> 00:34:06.240]  I want to get more into CIA halted a plan to kidnap Bin Laden in 1998.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.021]  Just one of many plans.
[00:34:08.101 --> 00:34:09.682]  Oh no, don't arrest our agent.
[00:34:11.403 --> 00:34:16.705]  Also how they went and arrested a mole when he was about to expose Al Qaeda being CIA.
[00:34:17.906 --> 00:34:20.247]  They're having trouble explaining that one away.
[00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:24.429]  And we'll get into President Bush continuing to surrender U.S.
[00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:26.230]  sovereignty to international entities.
[00:34:27.771 --> 00:34:29.452]  Documents uncovered proving U.S.
[00:34:29.492 --> 00:34:35.994]  doctors aided torturers at Abu Ghraib, Russian relocation centers, the British call their centers.
[00:34:36.815 --> 00:34:40.516]  Kerry still would have approved force for Iraq out of Reuters.
[00:34:40.536 --> 00:34:51.901]  Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry said he would have voted for the congressional resolution authorizing force against Iraq even if he had known there were no weapons of mass destruction were to be found.
[00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:53.782]  Wow!
[00:34:55.622 --> 00:34:57.243]  So what do you Democrats think about that?
[00:34:58.908 --> 00:35:00.809]  And then Bush mocks Kerry over it.
[00:35:00.869 --> 00:35:01.669]  We'll get to that.
[00:35:01.729 --> 00:35:03.890]  Bush's approval rating at lowest point ever.
[00:35:05.131 --> 00:35:09.233]  Also, we'll get into that mole situation, as I said.
[00:35:09.253 --> 00:35:13.575]  Immigration plan envisions incentives to illegal aliens to get them here.
[00:35:14.855 --> 00:35:16.276]  And much, much more.
[00:35:16.656 --> 00:35:23.119]  But right now, let's get into two articles that are in USA Today, today!
[00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:25.500]  On this Wednesday edition.
[00:35:26.869 --> 00:35:30.333]  Bush taps lawmaker to head the CIA.
[00:35:30.673 --> 00:35:35.378]  Goss could face political storm before confirmed.
[00:35:36.379 --> 00:35:43.245]  President Bush nominated Republican congressman and ex-spy chief, Porter Goss, on Tuesday to head the CIA.
[00:35:43.345 --> 00:35:50.833]  Leading senators immediately suggested that Goss, respected in both political parties, was on track to be confirmed in the Republican-controlled Senate.
[00:35:51.479 --> 00:35:56.885]  But Democrats' complaints that he is too political indicated there could be the contentious hearings.
[00:35:56.925 --> 00:36:04.694]  The CIA chief, they say, should give the President and other decision-makers non-partisan advice.
[00:36:04.734 --> 00:36:10.741]  The appointment comes at a turbulent time when the United States is pressing a global war on terror
[00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:18.118]  Shoring up homeland security against threats of attack and hearing calls for reform of the nation's intelligence service.
[00:36:18.258 --> 00:36:19.078]  I love it, reform.
[00:36:19.538 --> 00:36:20.919]  The total takeover of our society.
[00:36:21.199 --> 00:36:30.862]  Porter Goss is a leader with strong experience in intelligence and in fighting against terrorism, Bush said in a Rose Garden announcement, before leaving to campaign in Florida.
[00:36:31.242 --> 00:36:37.684]  He is the right man to lead this important agency at this critical moment in our nation's history.
[00:36:39.289 --> 00:36:44.833]  Goss, a Florida congressman, stepped down Tuesday as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
[00:36:45.573 --> 00:37:01.423]  The next Central Intelligence Agency director will have less authority if, as expected, Congress follows the 9-11 Commission's recommendation and creates the position of an intelligence czar, or lord, to, that's what it means, or supervise the CIA and more than a dozen other agencies.
[00:37:01.483 --> 00:37:05.446]  White House spokesman Scott McClellan did not rule out Goss getting that job.
[00:37:05.466 --> 00:37:06.166]  Yeah, that's the plan.
[00:37:06.907 --> 00:37:08.548]  Let's talk about Mr. Goss.
[00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:25.302]  This is the guy who met with General Mahmood Ahmed, the head of Pakistani intelligence, known CIA operator, who helped depose the elected leader of Pakistan to put in General Perez Musarraf a few years ago.
[00:37:25.322 --> 00:37:33.486]  Now on the morning of 9-11, he was having a sumptuous platter, a breakfast meal,
[00:37:34.517 --> 00:37:44.912]  With the head of Pakistani intelligence and the New York Times and the Associated Press reporter when the staffers came in and said, planes are hitting the towers, Goss looked at them and said, we know.
[00:37:46.054 --> 00:37:50.240]  Meanwhile, down the street, Lord Bush, Herbert Walker, Bush 41,
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:38:04.331]  Was having a sumptuous meal at an internal Carlyle Group private shareholder meeting, sitting at the table with the leader of the Bin Laden family.
[00:38:05.652 --> 00:38:12.237]  And then, of course, down the street the CIA was running a drill of hijacked jets flying into the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[00:38:12.257 --> 00:38:15.240]  Just so happened that was used to order NORAD to stand down.
[00:38:16.847 --> 00:38:33.656]  And we have, during that week, the Pakistani General meeting with the CIA Chief three days before, Mr. Tenet in meeting with the White House four days before, and just traveling all over, and Mr. Goss has been instrumental in the cover-up of 9-11.
[00:38:34.136 --> 00:38:40.620]  So I'm sure we're all very, very proud of Mr. Goss.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:44.642]  He's done a great job covering up, just like General Eberhardt did with NORAD.
[00:38:44.682 --> 00:38:46.003]  Now he's got the NORTHCOM job.
[00:38:47.137 --> 00:38:51.360]  It's just thoroughly disgusting to watch all of this.
[00:38:52.762 --> 00:38:59.126]  And Goss has been a continual intelligence operator for the Globalist.
[00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:08.081]  Now he'll end up being your CIA chief and then of course move into the new KGB boss position over the entire United States.
[00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:14.283]  All crime is terrorism and everything we do and say will be tracked and traced by his lordship, by the new Heinrich Himmler.
[00:39:14.683 --> 00:39:28.969]  So the new intelligence and takeover agencies like Homeland Security now fights terror and crime and puts up billions of dollars of cameras in all these cities to fight terror and crime and have the neighborhood watch fight terror and crime and high school kids fight terror and crime and direct the new
[00:39:29.549 --> 00:39:32.471]  Forced volunteer army domestically to fight terror and crime.
[00:39:33.632 --> 00:39:39.775]  And Goss will be over that, and just all these new agencies everywhere running our lives, but the border is wide open.
[00:39:40.776 --> 00:39:48.921]  The Houston Chronicle ran the headline last Sunday, this week I guess, 800,000 criminals ordered to be relieved.
[00:39:48.981 --> 00:39:54.804]  Illegal aliens with criminal records, that you have more rights as an illegal alien than as a citizen.
[00:39:55.445 --> 00:39:58.967]  And Bush is expanding that now, and we have some news for you on that subject.
[00:39:59.688 --> 00:40:03.849]  The other article, then we'll go to your calls, is The Arnold Factor.
[00:40:03.869 --> 00:40:07.070]  And it's a picture of Bush and Arnold.
[00:40:07.491 --> 00:40:16.894]  I guess if I said that I admired Hitler and screamed at black people and called them names, I'd get awards from Jewish organizations, but I'm against Nazis, so I'll be attacked.
[00:40:17.634 --> 00:40:18.694]  I'm not joking, by the way.
[00:40:19.915 --> 00:40:22.315]  I've always admired dictators like Hitler.
[00:40:23.896 --> 00:40:25.776]  I don't care if Kirk of all times is Nazi.
[00:40:25.816 --> 00:40:26.557]  We love him!
[00:40:26.617 --> 00:40:27.297]  We like him!
[00:40:28.047 --> 00:40:29.948]  I always dreamed of having total power.
[00:40:31.249 --> 00:40:33.590]  Most people are followers and need to be ruled.
[00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:35.371]  That's what I like to do is rule you.
[00:40:37.692 --> 00:40:40.174]  Black people are sub-human inwards.
[00:40:40.554 --> 00:40:41.354]  I don't like them.
[00:40:41.374 --> 00:40:42.635]  They shouldn't be allowed to compete.
[00:40:43.195 --> 00:40:43.936]  They're animals.
[00:40:45.116 --> 00:40:46.977]  Alright, but that's good, see?
[00:40:48.038 --> 00:40:51.620]  If you don't say black people are animals and you don't say Hitler's good, you're a Nazi.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.822]  You've got to learn how this works.
[00:40:55.642 --> 00:40:57.423]  See, after you visit Lord Rothschild,
[00:40:57.958 --> 00:40:59.519]  It's photographed by the Scotsman.
[00:40:59.559 --> 00:40:59.899]  You're okay.
[00:40:59.939 --> 00:41:02.841]  You can do whatever you want.
[00:41:02.861 --> 00:41:06.143]  Just like the founder of the Bilderberg Group was a Nazi, Prince Bernard.
[00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:07.524]  But that's okay.
[00:41:07.564 --> 00:41:09.005]  If you fight him, you're a Nazi.
[00:41:09.966 --> 00:41:22.794]  The Arnold Factor, and I love Senator, the great Senator, the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch wants to get rid of the 22nd Amendment so I can be President.
[00:41:24.042 --> 00:41:28.164]  Arnold Schwarzenegger should be one of President Bush's secret weapons this fall.
[00:41:29.144 --> 00:41:32.485]  He's anti-gun, pro-abortion, pro-open border, of course he is.
[00:41:32.906 --> 00:41:42.069]  He's a popular and charismatic Republican governor with star power and a Kennedy wife and appeal to Democrats in his home state of California and beyond.
[00:41:42.429 --> 00:41:50.593]  Instead, the Arnold factor in this campaign may come down to political body language with the two macho politicians you have, Bush.
[00:41:50.653 --> 00:41:51.293]  Bring them down!
[00:41:52.242 --> 00:41:53.102]  He's real macho.
[00:41:53.162 --> 00:41:55.603]  His relationship has sometimes been strained.
[00:41:55.924 --> 00:42:01.706]  He's able to convince California voters that they are on the same page when they differ on many cultural issues.
[00:42:02.006 --> 00:42:06.808]  And Schwarzenegger is balking at campaigning for Bush outside his state.
[00:42:08.409 --> 00:42:16.372]  Will Californians see the warm chemistry of John Kerry and John Edwards or the Bush has reached with former rival John McCain?
[00:42:17.272 --> 00:42:18.853]  I mean, it's just so sick.
[00:42:21.135 --> 00:42:25.858]  By the way, major polls, two-thirds of Californians agree with what I'm doing.
[00:42:25.878 --> 00:42:26.439]  They love it.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.562]  I helped run the Enron scam, so I was put in to stop it.
[00:42:33.103 --> 00:42:35.365]  And again, I'm not, well, do you support Gray Davis then?
[00:42:36.546 --> 00:42:37.126]  No, I don't.
[00:42:37.406 --> 00:42:38.067]  That's the point.
[00:42:38.227 --> 00:42:39.207]  There's no difference.
[00:42:40.088 --> 00:42:41.929]  By the way, Bush and Arnold are good buddies.
[00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:50.355]  The family vacations together, and they go to the Grove together, and have fun together there at the Grove.
[00:42:51.004 --> 00:42:56.768]  According to the New York Post, where, quote, gay porn stars headline service to members.
[00:42:57.889 --> 00:42:58.989]  Under what type of service?
[00:43:01.591 --> 00:43:05.193]  Let's go to Anthony in Louisiana.
[00:43:05.353 --> 00:43:06.294]  Anthony, go ahead.
[00:43:06.314 --> 00:43:07.795]  Hi, Alex.
[00:43:08.195 --> 00:43:18.202]  Today I want to talk about... I was thinking about some of your stances, and your stance that you are pro-solving the illegal alien problem.
[00:43:18.655 --> 00:43:18.955]  Yeah.
[00:43:18.995 --> 00:43:37.923]  But at the same time, but if you want to do that, aren't you just fueling the growing and burgeoning of biometrics industry that has all these technologies that spy on all of us, ready to use that as an excuse to employ in our cry out for solving the illegal problem?
[00:43:38.803 --> 00:43:40.344]  Well, you know, that's a good comment.
[00:43:41.224 --> 00:43:45.366]  Congressman Lamar Smith here in Central Texas, South Texas,
[00:43:47.034 --> 00:43:55.602]  About six years ago, he lobbied and said, no, let's have biometrics to get driver's license, even after they were in, because, you know, this will be good to stop illegal aliens.
[00:43:55.622 --> 00:43:59.605]  But then he got a waiver through, and Bush has the waiver, where illegals don't have to do this.
[00:43:59.886 --> 00:44:03.149]  If you're a citizen, you have to, but illegal aliens don't have to.
[00:44:03.369 --> 00:44:06.712]  Bush just did that again, reauthorized that, what, five months ago.
[00:44:07.999 --> 00:44:15.145]  And so, again, 40 plus states have the thumb scanners and the face scanners to get a driver's license.
[00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:21.331]  And for an American citizen to leave the country or someone from Western Europe or Asia or wherever to come in, they've got to do it.
[00:44:21.771 --> 00:44:23.713]  But people from Latin America don't.
[00:44:24.213 --> 00:44:25.714]  That's a federal ruling.
[00:44:26.155 --> 00:44:27.836]  I mean, a federal order by Bush.
[00:44:27.856 --> 00:44:29.317]  I don't know if you remember that.
[00:44:29.878 --> 00:44:32.340]  So you don't need biometrics to stop the illegals.
[00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:36.334]  You can simply stop offering a massive welfare.
[00:44:36.734 --> 00:44:37.795]  That'll stop a lot of it.
[00:44:38.356 --> 00:44:43.522]  And you can simply perhaps double the border patrol on the southern border.
[00:44:43.802 --> 00:44:48.768]  You know, go from 1,300 on duty at any one time to maybe 3,000 on duty.
[00:44:48.788 --> 00:44:50.449]  I mean, that's very cheap.
[00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:54.314]  We're talking about a couple hundred million dollars, which is just chicken feed.
[00:44:55.299 --> 00:44:56.200]  In this whole system.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.660]  But they don't want to do that.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.942]  You can prosecute coyotes more severely.
[00:45:00.962 --> 00:45:07.905]  I mean, sir, the headline in the Houston Chronicle Sunday was 800,000 fugitives released.
[00:45:08.646 --> 00:45:10.707]  I mean, we're talking murderers, rapists.
[00:45:11.607 --> 00:45:15.869]  There was that guy, the railway killer, who killed dozens of people and they just kept releasing him.
[00:45:15.909 --> 00:45:17.010]  I mean, you just have no idea.
[00:45:18.051 --> 00:45:27.019]  Uh, most of the time when they bust somebody breaking in cars or robbing houses here in Austin, Texas, it's illegal aliens because, I mean, they've got a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[00:45:28.214 --> 00:45:29.996]  So, something's got to be done about this.
[00:45:30.176 --> 00:45:38.922]  And the point I raise about the open borders is, how can they claim we've all got to give up our rights and be tracked and traced and no fly lifts and all this, but then the border's wide open?
[00:45:38.962 --> 00:45:39.983]  It's a joke, sir.
[00:45:40.183 --> 00:45:41.183]  That's why I point this out.
[00:45:41.824 --> 00:45:53.432]  Yeah, well, I'm totally with you on this whole... But you're right that they're selling us that biometrics is the answer to the illegals, and then quietly making it to where there's nothing there.
[00:45:54.013 --> 00:46:01.979]  Yeah, and I've also been noticing that the border problem is finally starting to come out in the New York Times and all these newspapers.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:03.621]  Yeah, but they're doing nothing.
[00:46:03.641 --> 00:46:06.643]  They're just saying, OK, we're going to search you when you try to go to Mexico.
[00:46:08.024 --> 00:46:08.645]  I'm serious.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:16.550]  But don't you think it's possible that it's kind of scripted for us to like then suddenly all care about the border a whole lot?
[00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:17.571]  No, this is the opposite.
[00:46:17.611 --> 00:46:18.432]  Sometimes they do that.
[00:46:19.674 --> 00:46:22.457]  87% of Americans, including Hispanics, they try to make it a racial issue.
[00:46:22.498 --> 00:46:22.798]  It's not.
[00:46:23.218 --> 00:46:24.180]  Are against the open border.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.201]  It's just common sense.
[00:46:26.743 --> 00:46:27.923]  It's driving down the wages.
[00:46:27.963 --> 00:46:31.706]  We can't accept billions of people from the entire third world.
[00:46:31.766 --> 00:46:33.107]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:46:33.127 --> 00:46:35.009]  When's it going to end?
[00:46:35.649 --> 00:46:39.171]  I'm all for immigration, but we can't absorb 2 million a year, 3 million a year.
[00:46:39.592 --> 00:46:43.835]  Yeah, I just think it has the potential to be a solution that's really evil.
[00:46:43.915 --> 00:46:46.857]  I also see in the news that Homeland Security is working.
[00:46:46.877 --> 00:46:53.662]  They're like, oh, well now we're going to go down and... But again, they're doing nothing but trying to bust people shipping in drugs that haven't paid their cut.
[00:46:54.242 --> 00:46:57.225]  Greetings Alex from the liberal cesspool state of America, New Jersey.
[00:47:12.112 --> 00:47:14.434]  And, uh, you did a tremendous Arnold impression.
[00:47:14.494 --> 00:47:15.835]  Maybe you can do McGreevy next.
[00:47:15.975 --> 00:47:17.517]  I don't think I did a very good one!
[00:47:18.277 --> 00:47:20.319]  Wait until I get your firearms!
[00:47:20.559 --> 00:47:20.980]  Indeed.
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.323]  Uh, kind of a statement and then a question for you.
[00:47:24.483 --> 00:47:25.784]  You're going to be a little man.
[00:47:25.804 --> 00:47:26.745]  You're going to beg me.
[00:47:26.765 --> 00:47:29.047]  You're going to lick my boots once I get your gun.
[00:47:29.067 --> 00:47:33.991]  Uh, I live a handful of miles from Lakehurst Naval Air Base and Fort Dix.
[00:47:34.431 --> 00:47:35.372]  Listen to me now.
[00:47:35.432 --> 00:47:36.433]  Believe me later.
[00:47:36.493 --> 00:47:37.634]  You're my slave.
[00:47:37.814 --> 00:47:38.495]  I'm Uber.
[00:47:38.575 --> 00:47:38.855]  Go ahead.
[00:47:38.875 --> 00:47:39.235]  I'm sorry.
[00:47:39.395 --> 00:47:40.076]  That's quite all right.
[00:47:41.161 --> 00:47:57.806]  Living a handful of miles from Lake Hurston, Fort Dixie, here in Central Jersey, over the last couple years since 9-1-1, I've noticed in the wee hours of the morning, 2, 3, 4 o'clock in the morning, many, many times, on many occasions, these fighter planes going overhead, not knowing what's going on.
[00:47:57.846 --> 00:48:01.467]  And I'm sure if I called over there, I would not get the correct answer anyway.
[00:48:02.347 --> 00:48:05.528]  But recently I came upon this in the local newspaper.
[00:48:06.048 --> 00:48:09.029]  They were looking for role players to act as foreign civilians
[00:48:09.875 --> 00:48:13.938]  On the battlefield opposing military forces at Fort Dixon in support of U.S.
[00:48:13.998 --> 00:48:14.939]  military training.
[00:48:15.619 --> 00:48:16.720]  Yeah, they always say that.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.382]  Then you go to the training and they scream, I'm an American, not the cab!
[00:48:19.482 --> 00:48:20.803]  I have rights to firearms!
[00:48:21.223 --> 00:48:21.523]  Indeed.
[00:48:22.284 --> 00:48:34.612]  The other thing was, sometimes it's not terrific to speak about others on the radio, but the other night I just came upon Stephen Quayle, who I heard you with a few months ago on Coast to Coast.
[00:48:34.652 --> 00:48:35.693]  He was on his program.
[00:48:36.576 --> 00:48:47.985]  And I'm a little confused, because while listening to him, he was almost talking about something so drastic coming in the next couple weeks, which he did not mention.
[00:48:48.005 --> 00:48:57.312]  He was very cryptic, and as a believer in Christ, I was left with the impression I should take my sandwich board sign out and put on the rapture is coming, because
[00:48:58.007 --> 00:49:00.090]  I don't know any, nor did he say.
[00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:10.043]  Well, Steve puts out a lot of good info, I disagree with some of it, and it's always cryptic, but I think the real world is cryptic, and the government is saying, you know, early September, it's all over, it's gonna happen.
[00:49:10.864 --> 00:49:12.867]  But, you know, I don't know if that's the case, but...
[00:49:15.555 --> 00:49:23.240]  I mean, you know, none of us totally agree with each other, and Steve believes that there's this real Al-Qaeda threat, and I do too, but it's Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.080]  Yes, indeed.
[00:49:24.401 --> 00:49:28.883]  Will you be on any programs soon, such as Coast to Coast again?
[00:49:29.244 --> 00:49:34.187]  I'm on a lot of syndicated shows, but they haven't called me yet to set me back up for the show.
[00:49:34.207 --> 00:49:37.929]  They said they are going to do that soon, but email them and tell them you want me back on.
[00:49:37.969 --> 00:49:40.591]  Will do, and I appreciate all your time today, Alex, and God bless you.
[00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:41.231]  You bet.
[00:49:41.271 --> 00:49:42.812]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:49:43.422 --> 00:49:46.924]  Yeah, I've been on the show three times now in the last six months, eight months.
[00:49:48.345 --> 00:49:49.666]  And they said they're going to have me back on.
[00:49:49.686 --> 00:49:51.727]  I want to go back on by myself for three hours.
[00:49:51.767 --> 00:49:53.188]  That's when it really is effective.
[00:49:53.788 --> 00:49:56.550]  But I appreciate that show being opened up to more diverse viewpoints.
[00:49:56.570 --> 00:50:01.053]  They have done that and I think George Norrie is doing a better job than some of the past folks.
[00:50:02.296 --> 00:50:03.938]  I think, you know, I appreciate it.
[00:50:03.998 --> 00:50:08.403]  I mean, I can't argue with somebody who has 14 million listeners an hour having me on three times.
[00:50:08.964 --> 00:50:12.868]  One time for three hours, another time for five hours, which they've never done before.
[00:50:12.888 --> 00:50:13.969]  They did a five-hour show.
[00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:21.097]  We're going to breakie here in just a second, and when we get back, I will get into news.
[00:50:21.969 --> 00:50:27.993]  And then we've got a guest coming up that you absolutely do not want to miss with a vaccine situation and we'll take more calls.
[00:50:28.173 --> 00:50:34.217]  Again, the website is PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:34.277 --> 00:50:35.158]  All three are different sites.
[00:50:35.678 --> 00:50:37.339]  Check them out today.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:42.583]  And remember, giving up your liberty gives you tyranny, not security.
[00:50:43.604 --> 00:50:43.944]  Alright.
[00:50:44.733 --> 00:50:48.577]  We shall return, so again, please stay with us.
[00:50:48.777 --> 00:50:53.542]  And remember, resistance to tyranny and to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:50:53.582 --> 00:50:54.223]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.374 --> 00:51:02.875]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.055 --> 00:51:06.137]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.277 --> 00:51:10.179]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.219 --> 00:51:14.461]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.802 --> 00:51:18.584]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.664 --> 00:51:20.565]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:23.387 --> 00:51:28.751]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.931 --> 00:51:31.973]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.153 --> 00:51:35.015]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.515 --> 00:51:41.620]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:45.944]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:46.344 --> 00:51:47.726]  Order your video today.

[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.663]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:06.763 --> 00:52:09.666]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:09.726 --> 00:52:16.452]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:16.632 --> 00:52:19.654]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:19.855 --> 00:52:22.237]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:22.357 --> 00:52:27.081]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:52:27.261 --> 00:52:36.567]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur.
[00:52:36.728 --> 00:52:41.831]  Even Nitrates and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[00:54:05.463 --> 00:54:06.983]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.484 --> 00:54:10.225]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.685 --> 00:54:14.147]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:14.187 --> 00:54:16.669]  I went down, down, down.
[00:54:17.029 --> 00:54:18.930]  And the flames went higher.
[00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:21.191]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:54:22.152 --> 00:54:23.572]  The ring of fire.
[00:54:24.433 --> 00:54:25.894]  The ring of fire.
[00:54:27.094 --> 00:54:27.935]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:54:28.015 --> 00:54:31.477]  Hard to believe old Johnny Cash has gone home to be with the Lord.
[00:54:34.207 --> 00:54:35.188]  Alright, my friends.
[00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:40.772]  Boy, we'll go to your calls here in a minute.
[00:54:41.452 --> 00:54:43.734]  You know, don't worry, this broadcast is documented.
[00:54:44.254 --> 00:54:49.418]  Evil always falls of its own weight, but it crushes civilizations, in many cases, in its full.
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:59.025]  And one of the best tools we've got in this fight against the organized crime syndicate that is the New World Order are the ten
[00:55:00.606 --> 00:55:03.128]  Documentary films that I have made.
[00:55:05.329 --> 00:55:22.581]  Whether it's America Destroyed by Design that covers the UN takeover of our national parks, the Oklahoma City bombing, the thumb scanning biometrics, or Police State 3 Total Enslavement that covers Homeland Security, Patriot Act 1 and 2, the government run white slavery rings, PNAC, the neocons,
[00:55:23.999 --> 00:55:25.040]  And so much more.
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:26.481]  My 9-11 films.
[00:55:26.501 --> 00:55:28.363]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror.
[00:55:28.623 --> 00:55:30.144]  They're all over 2 hours long.
[00:55:30.184 --> 00:55:33.386]  Some are 2 and a half plus hours long.
[00:55:33.407 --> 00:55:35.048]  They're $25.95 apiece.
[00:55:35.468 --> 00:55:38.290]  $20 if you order 3 or more of any of the 10 titles I've made.
[00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:40.312]  That's an $18 discount on the 3-tape special.
[00:55:40.332 --> 00:55:42.514]  $24 discount on the 4-tape special.
[00:55:42.894 --> 00:55:44.015]  And so on and so forth.
[00:55:45.123 --> 00:55:50.847]  I have also carry a bunch of other books and videos and books on tape by other great researchers and authors.
[00:55:51.287 --> 00:55:56.371]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and peruse the Safe Secure online shopping cart.

[00:56:09.286 --> 00:56:10.868]  Or just write to me.
[00:56:10.948 --> 00:56:14.930]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, spelled L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:56:32.562 --> 00:56:35.243]  Let's go ahead and talk to Keith in Louisiana.
[00:56:35.283 --> 00:56:35.724]  Go ahead.
[00:56:36.404 --> 00:56:36.964]  Hello, Alex.
[00:56:37.164 --> 00:56:37.705]  Hello, sir.
[00:56:37.905 --> 00:56:38.525]  This is Kenneth.
[00:56:38.845 --> 00:56:39.866]  Okay, Kenneth, go ahead.
[00:56:40.126 --> 00:56:52.092]  Yeah, any of these white Republicans who are for the war on terrorism, I'd like to ask you, where were they when the ANC took over that white Christian nation of South Africa?
[00:56:55.543 --> 00:56:57.786]  They're not consistent, would you think, or what?
[00:56:58.327 --> 00:56:59.268]  I'm confused, sir.
[00:56:59.328 --> 00:57:03.714]  I mean, you've got black people, white people, Hispanics for this war.
[00:57:03.774 --> 00:57:05.156]  You've got John Kerry for it.
[00:57:05.557 --> 00:57:05.797]  Yeah.
[00:57:06.018 --> 00:57:09.783]  Well, I'm just saying, it's a shame, and it's a double standard.
[00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:12.351]  Well, I will say this.
[00:57:12.471 --> 00:57:18.414]  I don't support apartheid or what happened in Africa, but they even admit that place is ten times worse off now.
[00:57:19.134 --> 00:57:20.194]  But that was by design.
[00:57:20.234 --> 00:57:24.356]  The globalists wanted to loot South Africa, and you've still got the same elites in power.
[00:57:24.416 --> 00:57:25.917]  They're just looting the daylights out of it.
[00:57:26.477 --> 00:57:26.717]  Right.
[00:57:26.837 --> 00:57:29.218]  It is worse since then.
[00:57:29.538 --> 00:57:30.819]  Highest crime rate in the world.
[00:57:31.119 --> 00:57:31.899]  Oh, yes, yes.
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:39.743]  And it's hard to believe that America's descended from Vikings and Vandals, people who despise the multicultural Roman Empire,
[00:57:40.342 --> 00:57:52.365]  People who resisted evil, and today, we're not resisting evil in a way the Republican Party seems to be embracing it by being for the war on terrorism.
[00:57:52.445 --> 00:58:01.528]  Anybody that tries to destroy someone's culture, whether they're Native American or German or Jewish, is wrong, but to just say that, are you saying other groups of people are evil, period?
[00:58:01.548 --> 00:58:03.008]  I don't agree with that.
[00:58:03.689 --> 00:58:04.189]  What group?
[00:58:04.249 --> 00:58:04.649]  DNC?
[00:58:05.413 --> 00:58:07.734]  Well, no, I mean, you're talking about resisting evil.
[00:58:07.754 --> 00:58:08.714]  I don't understand.
[00:58:08.894 --> 00:58:17.298]  Well, I'm just saying that the war on terrorism is really a war in our pocketbooks, if you think about it.
[00:58:17.338 --> 00:58:19.059]  Well, it's also a war on our freedoms.
[00:58:19.519 --> 00:58:20.319]  Right, exactly.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.640]  All right, Kenneth, anything else?
[00:58:24.041 --> 00:58:24.621]  Take care, man.
[00:58:25.021 --> 00:58:26.181]  All right, thanks for the call.
[00:58:26.221 --> 00:58:27.482]  We'll start the next hour.
[00:58:27.522 --> 00:58:28.602]  Go to Bill, John, and others.
[00:58:29.303 --> 00:58:30.623]  And we have a guest coming up.
[00:58:30.663 --> 00:58:32.004]  Toll free number to join us on air, 800-259-9231.
[00:58:36.758 --> 00:58:44.200]  And, uh, when we get back, I will blitz through some news items, and then we will, uh, let our guest then shortly go to your calls.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:45.660]  So stay with us.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:49.641]  The second hour is only 70 seconds away.
[00:58:57.743 --> 00:58:58.424]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.044 --> 00:59:00.064]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:00.809 --> 00:59:01.930]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:03.430]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:05.051]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.711 --> 00:59:09.373]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:14.035]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.297 --> 00:59:27.241]  Coming up later in the hour, we'll be talking to a gentleman who's written a book, scholarly work, about
[00:59:27.959 --> 00:59:36.422]  Mercury in the vaccines and the explosion over a thousand percent of autism and other brain disorders directly linked according to the CDC's own documents to autism.
[00:59:37.962 --> 00:59:42.283]  And we'll also get into the CIA halted a plan to kidnap Bin Laden in 1998.
[00:59:43.264 --> 00:59:45.084]  President Bush continues to surrender U.S.
[00:59:45.124 --> 00:59:46.605]  sovereignty to international entities.
[00:59:47.145 --> 00:59:48.725]  Documents uncovered proving U.S.
[00:59:48.765 --> 00:59:50.746]  doctors aided torturers in Abu Ghraib.
[00:59:51.266 --> 00:59:53.907]  Kerry still would have approved force for Iraq.
[00:59:54.784 --> 01:00:00.006]  I made more comments yesterday about how even if weapons of mass destruction weren't involved, he thinks the invasion was good.
[01:00:00.086 --> 01:00:01.746]  So, how do the Democrats like that?
[01:00:01.766 --> 01:00:05.548]  I mean, you talk about open corruption, and Bush was out crowing over this.
[01:00:05.928 --> 01:00:09.529]  Also, Bush's approval rating plunges to all-time record lows.
[01:00:09.949 --> 01:00:10.909]  More about the U.S.
[01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:15.591]  outing its own al-Qaeda mole when they were on the heels of busting al-Qaeda.
[01:00:17.006 --> 01:00:18.286]  There's an article I wanted to cover.
[01:00:18.347 --> 01:00:21.988]  Immigration plan envisions incentives to illegal aliens.
[01:00:22.268 --> 01:00:26.549]  Bush's mass amnesty plan, biggest ever, which he said isn't an amnesty.
[01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:31.611]  Again, it's like Waco as they're ramming tanks into the walls saying this is not an assault.
[01:00:31.651 --> 01:00:32.952]  Don't run, we are your friends.
[01:00:33.692 --> 01:00:36.413]  Immigration plan envisions incentives to illegal aliens.
[01:00:36.793 --> 01:00:45.556]  Millions of illegal aliens in the United States will be free from arrest and deportation, have access to tax-deferred savings accounts and social security credits, and get unrestricted travel
[01:00:46.232 --> 01:00:49.314]  From their home countries under President Bush's guest worker program.
[01:00:49.735 --> 01:00:52.857]  So I won't be getting into that.
[01:00:53.998 --> 01:00:58.081]  For you also scientists, give cloning go-ahead in the United Kingdom.
[01:00:58.161 --> 01:01:01.124]  I ran to test a missile capable of hitting Israel.
[01:01:02.064 --> 01:01:06.027]  And judge orders Bibles removed from courtrooms.
[01:01:07.128 --> 01:01:08.269]  Can't have that Bible in there.
[01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:14.234]  And CBS newsman Mike Wallace was rude to a government bureaucrat so they came and arrested him.
[01:01:15.129 --> 01:01:15.769]  I'm not kidding.
[01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:17.050]  They say, well he was a little bit rude.
[01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:17.690]  They actually say that.
[01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:19.191]  It's like the lady in D.C.
[01:01:19.251 --> 01:01:23.374]  who walked into the train station and finished a candy bar and the guy said, you're not allowed to have a candy bar.
[01:01:23.394 --> 01:01:26.315]  She said she ate the last piece and he said she rudely chewed.
[01:01:26.375 --> 01:01:27.736]  Aggressively chewed was the quote.
[01:01:27.756 --> 01:01:29.257]  So they had to arrest her.
[01:01:30.117 --> 01:01:31.538]  The guy put his feet up on a park bench.
[01:01:31.578 --> 01:01:32.178]  They arrested him.
[01:01:32.198 --> 01:01:34.800]  Of course his wife ended up being the head of the park service.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.521]  You know, we see this all the time.
[01:01:36.641 --> 01:01:37.861]  Oh, you were rude to me.
[01:01:37.881 --> 01:01:39.022]  You didn't grovel properly.
[01:01:39.422 --> 01:01:41.744]  I'm arresting you for resisting without violence.
[01:01:42.764 --> 01:01:44.325]  You're going to serve time as a felon.
[01:01:45.865 --> 01:01:47.406]  Did the Germans even have that?
[01:01:47.447 --> 01:01:49.648]  You don't lick the boots of the Gestapo, you get in trouble?
[01:01:51.009 --> 01:01:52.310]  Bill in Vermont!
[01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:53.831]  Welcome, sir!
[01:01:55.472 --> 01:02:02.016]  Those people that doubt that we created communism, I suggest I have a bunch of things they could go and look it up.
[01:02:02.697 --> 01:02:09.541]  One is a book by William Simon, Reagan's Commerce Secretary, a book called A Time for Truth.
[01:02:10.942 --> 01:02:13.964]  A book by Anthony Sutton called National Suicide.
[01:02:14.941 --> 01:02:18.003]  A book by John Robinson called Proofs of a Conspiracy.
[01:02:18.023 --> 01:02:23.206]  You can go to the Congressional Record between April, May, and June in 1933.
[01:02:23.646 --> 01:02:27.628]  You'll find loans to Russia to build truck factories by Ford Motors.
[01:02:28.869 --> 01:02:43.257]  If you go to the Congressional Record September 2, 1919, the Congressional Record has Joseph Tumulty, T-U-M-U-L-T-Y, in the transfer of $20 million of Wilson's War Fund to the Bolsheviks.
[01:02:43.317 --> 01:02:44.078]  You can find that
[01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:46.851]  Um, and, uh, let me see here.
[01:02:47.551 --> 01:02:52.072]  Porter Goss, I wanted to say, was part of the Iran-Contra stuff, if I remember right.
[01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:53.213]  Oh, yes he was.
[01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:56.034]  Former CIA boy, now to be our new ruler.
[01:02:56.834 --> 01:02:59.835]  Involved with Pakistani intelligence on 9-11.
[01:03:00.555 --> 01:03:04.656]  And Alex, are you aware of the Cycle of Man theory by Ravi Bhattra?
[01:03:05.377 --> 01:03:05.617]  No.
[01:03:05.877 --> 01:03:12.619]  Alright, um, got a book out called The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism, or it might be The Communism and Capitalism.
[01:03:13.174 --> 01:03:13.694]  He wrote it in 1978.
[01:03:15.315 --> 01:03:15.956]  I read the book in 1989.
[01:03:16.356 --> 01:03:29.903]  In 1978, he predicted, according to a theory based on an absolute cycle of four different mindsets, and he predicted that there would be an eight-year war between Iran and Iraq.
[01:03:30.403 --> 01:03:31.964]  And that was two years before it happened.
[01:03:32.024 --> 01:03:34.866]  He predicted that the Soviet Union would collapse in 1990.
[01:03:35.926 --> 01:03:39.448]  He said in the year 2005 there would be a civil war in the United States.
[01:03:40.714 --> 01:03:42.397]  He'd be a good guest for your show.
[01:03:42.537 --> 01:03:43.279]  That's incredible.
[01:03:43.299 --> 01:03:45.583]  Will you send that to tips at InfoWars.com?
[01:03:45.944 --> 01:03:46.325]  Okay.
[01:03:46.966 --> 01:03:47.286]  Do it.
[01:03:47.527 --> 01:03:48.108]  Great job.
[01:03:48.689 --> 01:03:50.192]  Yeah, this stuff's all scripted out.
[01:03:50.252 --> 01:03:51.936]  They control all the command and control systems.
[01:03:55.709 --> 01:04:01.190]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:05.831]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:06.071 --> 01:04:13.113]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.493 --> 01:04:19.595]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.735 --> 01:04:20.955]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.295 --> 01:04:24.239]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:04:24.399 --> 01:04:26.401]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:04:26.742 --> 01:04:33.970]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:37.655]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:04:54.378 --> 01:04:56.941]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:56.961 --> 01:04:58.023]  The New World Order.
[01:05:08.727 --> 01:05:09.447]  Hammered!
[01:05:09.687 --> 01:05:13.929]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[01:07:00.836 --> 01:07:01.977]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:01.997 --> 01:07:03.438]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.178 --> 01:07:04.959]  Well so does he.
[01:07:05.735 --> 01:07:09.698]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.918 --> 01:07:21.287]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:23.889 --> 01:07:33.916]  I don't know if our guest has gone all the way down the rabbit hole, but I know he's been damaged by this vicious system.
[01:07:35.276 --> 01:07:56.394]  You see, I happen to know that the vaccine program is part of a worldwide eugenics operation to dumb down the population, to poison the population, to implant genetically engineered cancer DNA protein sheaths, to reprogram the body, kind of a Logan's Run type system, to get rid of us when we hit about age 50.
[01:07:56.634 --> 01:08:01.458]  That's why cancer is up, in many cases, over 500% with different types of cancer.
[01:08:03.007 --> 01:08:05.088]  But his child was damaged by this.
[01:08:05.108 --> 01:08:06.468]  He's written a powerful book.
[01:08:06.808 --> 01:08:07.948]  We'll go to him here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:07.968 --> 01:08:08.889]  We're not going to him right now.
[01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:11.229]  Courtney Zitzke.
[01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:16.851]  And his book is Mercury, The Winged Messenger.
[01:08:17.491 --> 01:08:22.953]  And he's the father of Ian, who became autistic after receiving a multiple vaccine injection.
[01:08:23.153 --> 01:08:24.373]  So that's coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:25.633]  I wanted to give you some background.
[01:08:26.294 --> 01:08:29.495]  On PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, we have huge archives.
[01:08:29.695 --> 01:08:30.735]  Here's ABC News.
[01:08:31.992 --> 01:08:34.937]  CDC knew a potential link between autism and vaccines.
[01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:41.688]  Five-year-old Ryan Anderson of Jacksonville Beach is an animated happy child, but that wasn't always the case.
[01:08:44.777 --> 01:08:57.668]  His course of deterioration from a happy, developmentally appropriate child to the problems he began to develop started right after he received the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines as Ryan's father, Bruce Anderson.
[01:08:57.708 --> 01:09:06.615]  Now several therapies are underway to restore Ryan's cognitive and behavioral development, which began to show significant impairment at age 18 months, right after he was given the shots.
[01:09:08.336 --> 01:09:12.860]  And then the ABC News gets into the Center for Disease Control published a study last fall
[01:09:13.773 --> 01:09:18.695]  Repudiating any possible link between thimerosal or mercury and developmental problems like autism and children.
[01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:27.559]  However, First Coast News has obtained non-published documents that show the CDC did have data supporting such a link but kept it from the public.
[01:09:28.199 --> 01:09:37.443]  Documents released in the Freedom of Information Act that tell the transcript of a meeting held in June of 2000 between members of the CDC, the FDA, and representatives from the vaccine industry.
[01:09:38.063 --> 01:09:38.423]  The groups
[01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:48.934]  I discussed the results of a February 2000 study that found a significant association between exposure to thimerosal containing vaccines and developmental issues like autism in children.
[01:09:49.914 --> 01:09:51.515]  Some of the comments from the transcript.
[01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:56.498]  There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest we've got a serious problem.
[01:09:56.998 --> 01:09:58.239]  My gut feeling it worries me.
[01:09:58.279 --> 01:10:02.681]  I don't want my grandson to get these thimerosal containing vaccines until we know better what's going on.
[01:10:03.381 --> 01:10:06.082]  We are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits.
[01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:08.984]  Finally, we have asked you to keep this information confidential.
[01:10:09.637 --> 01:10:10.337]  That's what happened.
[01:10:10.657 --> 01:10:20.439]  Three years later, the CDC published a study in the November 2003 issue of Pediatrics contradicting the earlier results and clearing the marisol of any link of neurological problems in children.
[01:10:20.479 --> 01:10:32.802]  Well folks, a child who weighs 10 pounds gets given several hundred times the safe level of it and it's admitted to attack the brain and break down brain development.
[01:10:32.822 --> 01:10:33.762]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[01:10:34.262 --> 01:10:36.043]  It's what mercury exposure does.
[01:10:36.563 --> 01:10:37.863]  It's not rocket science.
[01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:42.713]  One of the most studied neurotoxins, heavy metals, is mercury.
[01:10:44.215 --> 01:10:46.176]  They knew a thousand years ago it was toxic.
[01:10:47.998 --> 01:10:51.300]  And they know what it's doing, but that's only one thing.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.643]  Folks, we've caught them putting stuff in vaccines to sterilize women.
[01:10:54.963 --> 01:10:56.925]  We've caught them putting cancer viruses in them.
[01:10:57.305 --> 01:10:58.626]  Major governments have caught them.
[01:10:58.666 --> 01:11:03.410]  We have hundreds of articles mainstream posted, but again, it's a mainstream article here, a mainstream article there.
[01:11:03.791 --> 01:11:04.851]  No one ever puts it together.
[01:11:04.931 --> 01:11:05.452]  We do that.
[01:11:06.559 --> 01:11:12.463]  Go read the section on our site, and then you tell me when you read Henry Kissinger ordering the third world in 73.
[01:11:12.523 --> 01:11:17.386]  Sterilize half your women with these systems or you won't get any money.
[01:11:19.227 --> 01:11:26.751]  Australia is saying we're going to sterilize people through the vaccines and through chemicals we're going to put in the grain that we're going to ship as an aid program to Asia.
[01:11:27.632 --> 01:11:28.873]  Go read it for yourself.
[01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:33.115]  Sydney Morning Herald, ABC, all this.
[01:11:33.315 --> 01:11:36.157]  I just look at the facts and look at the pattern.
[01:11:36.963 --> 01:11:58.005]  So, and I've got stacks of articles here, but we're going to go ahead and go to Courtney Zitzke, and he's joining us, and he's a businessman, I guess what you call a financial advisor planner, and he's written this new book off a lot of medical research, Mercury the Winged Messenger, and sir, it's good to have you on with us.
[01:11:58.465 --> 01:11:59.026]  Thank you very much.
[01:12:00.114 --> 01:12:11.318]  I don't know if you've gone down the rabbit hole that far, Alice, to really see the true horror of the Matrix, but you certainly know what the mercury did to your son and that autism is up over a thousand percent.
[01:12:12.178 --> 01:12:15.319]  Tell us about your story and what happened to you and your family and your book.
[01:12:16.099 --> 01:12:21.261]  Well, it all started back in 1996 when we had Ian.
[01:12:21.301 --> 01:12:23.501]  When we had him, he was an absolutely perfect child.
[01:12:24.101 --> 01:12:25.562]  He was given all the tests at birth.
[01:12:26.751 --> 01:12:30.393]  The pediatricians had reported to us that he was an absolutely perfect child.
[01:12:32.073 --> 01:12:37.495]  So two weeks later we started him off with the vaccines as mandated by the federal government as necessary.
[01:12:37.515 --> 01:12:43.998]  And within probably eight to nine months we started noticing that there was a problem.
[01:12:45.623 --> 01:12:59.388]  So, we continue to do the vaccines because... Sir, I hate to interrupt you, but in half the cases, when they have a bad reaction, the child's given the shot, goes into seizures two hours later, they say it's shaken babysitter, I'm going to take the child, and then the child's gone.
[01:12:59.868 --> 01:13:01.668]  So, I mean, I don't know if you're aware of that.
[01:13:01.868 --> 01:13:03.049]  Yeah, yes, I am aware of that.
[01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:06.990]  But, you know, we figure that, well, he's just growing up, you know, and he's going through different phases.
[01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:09.931]  And this has happened to literally hundreds of thousands of parents.
[01:13:10.311 --> 01:13:11.493]  They've all reported the same thing.
[01:13:11.513 --> 01:13:12.975]  It's several million now sir, but go ahead.
[01:13:13.015 --> 01:13:17.840]  Yeah, well, this is what we know of in this country, and probably worldwide it's into the millions.
[01:13:18.181 --> 01:13:26.271]  But what had happened was that, you know, these children were receiving federally mandated 21 vaccinations before their age of 2 years old.
[01:13:26.291 --> 01:13:26.271]  21!
[01:13:26.311 --> 01:13:26.491]  Yeah.
[01:13:30.983 --> 01:13:34.026]  21 vaccines before the ages of 2 and 3 years old.
[01:13:34.086 --> 01:13:35.548]  Now they want them to have 35.
[01:13:35.688 --> 01:13:36.188]  Yes, they do.
[01:13:36.609 --> 01:13:40.412]  And it's on track to be 47 by next year.
[01:13:42.654 --> 01:13:48.660]  It's a tremendous amount of money that the pharmaceutical companies make from a federally mandated program.
[01:13:49.881 --> 01:13:52.243]  We're talking into the billions of dollars.
[01:13:52.383 --> 01:13:53.985]  But what has happened to these children?
[01:13:54.485 --> 01:13:56.387]  And the pattern is all exactly the same.
[01:13:57.386 --> 01:14:03.871]  After the child receives the vaccines, the last series, they all report the same exact thing.
[01:14:03.991 --> 01:14:09.554]  The child slips into a neurological condition and just basically goes into oblivion.
[01:14:09.834 --> 01:14:10.735]  Malaise, yes.
[01:14:11.275 --> 01:14:15.818]  So what happened was we realized that there was some serious problems.
[01:14:15.858 --> 01:14:21.882]  So we went to pediatric neurologists and we started to do all kinds of testing and they diagnosed him as autistic.
[01:14:22.202 --> 01:14:24.524]  And well, he was not born autistic.
[01:14:25.666 --> 01:14:28.408]  This is not something a child just develops on its own.
[01:14:28.628 --> 01:14:30.029]  I'm so sorry, Courtney.
[01:14:30.269 --> 01:14:32.371]  Well, yeah, I think everybody's sorry about it.
[01:14:32.391 --> 01:14:32.831]  God bless you.
[01:14:33.492 --> 01:14:36.454]  But what had happened was we had realized that there may be a problem.
[01:14:36.494 --> 01:14:46.200]  So we cross-referenced the vaccine lot numbers with the thimerosal content that was published, oh, maybe about seven or eight years ago.
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:50.323]  And we realized that there was a tremendous amount of mercury that was given to this child.
[01:14:51.084 --> 01:14:58.832]  Since that time, we have gone to several toxicologists and done what is called a chelation protocol, which is heavy metal removal.
[01:14:59.152 --> 01:15:00.613]  How did that do for you?
[01:15:00.653 --> 01:15:02.215]  In fact, it helped quite a bit.
[01:15:02.794 --> 01:15:05.456]  Unfortunately, though, a lot of parents don't know this.
[01:15:05.516 --> 01:15:06.136]  Don't do it early.
[01:15:06.156 --> 01:15:15.222]  If you do it early, they've had children that go into comas, and if the parents are able to keep the child and not be blamed, they're then able to chelate, and the child comes out of it and is fine.
[01:15:15.242 --> 01:15:17.284]  That is correct, and we've heard that, too.
[01:15:17.824 --> 01:15:19.625]  I interviewed about 20 parents.
[01:15:19.965 --> 01:15:26.650]  Well, the science behind the chelation was really not mainstream medicine, and it should have been for many years.
[01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:31.413]  Yeah, but parents are noticing a huge improvement in their child's motor development.
[01:15:31.926 --> 01:15:35.888]  But the problem with the mercury is that the damage is often permanent.
[01:15:35.928 --> 01:15:43.251]  You can stop the mercury from doing more damage, but only time will tell if the damage is permanent.
[01:15:49.794 --> 01:15:52.155]  The brain can rewire in the first four years.
[01:15:52.876 --> 01:15:59.879]  Sometimes they even turn out, this sounds weird, even smarter because you're able to get the mercury out and the brain will actually rewire.
[01:15:59.899 --> 01:16:01.820]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:07.083]  If parents don't know and it gets past the fourth year where the brain is really developing and growing, then it's irreversible.
[01:16:07.323 --> 01:16:09.284]  Well, that's the sad thing about it.
[01:16:10.124 --> 01:16:15.907]  What's happened to Ian is that he's making tremendous progress and I think a lot of other parents that are doing the chelation
[01:16:16.784 --> 01:16:17.064]  I think?
[01:16:36.502 --> 01:16:39.723]  Uh, the number I have from the Associated Press is 250 times, but let me just add this here.
[01:16:39.743 --> 01:16:42.184]  We went from 25 years ago, in the late 70s, this is the official numbers,
[01:16:54.228 --> 01:17:08.392]  From 1 in 25,000 having autism to now 1 out of a thousand and the numbers are tracking for 1 in 169 to have some type of autism related brain disorder with the new numbers.
[01:17:08.712 --> 01:17:12.673]  That is absolutely correct and that is an absolute international tragedy.
[01:17:13.554 --> 01:17:21.436]  Children are being brain damaged and the only thing that can explain it is the toxic environmental exposure to mercury.
[01:17:22.935 --> 01:17:25.956]  That's the only thing that puts this whole thing together.
[01:17:26.376 --> 01:17:32.019]  Well, it's incredible, and that's why this broadcast is so important and why I want to thank every AM and FM affiliate.
[01:17:32.319 --> 01:17:33.920]  You're saving children's lives.
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:44.224]  The problem is they're moving to try to force people to vaccinate children, and I'm sure you're aware, sir, they've taken it out of some vaccines, but then others, like the flu shot, they've actually increased the thimerosal level.
[01:17:44.244 --> 01:17:44.804]  Are you aware of that?
[01:17:45.044 --> 01:17:48.466]  Yes, I am aware of that, and I can't believe that they would intentionally do that.
[01:17:48.806 --> 01:17:49.366]  Oh, I do.
[01:17:49.626 --> 01:17:50.146]  Unbelievable.
[01:17:50.486 --> 01:17:51.867]  Have you ever read Bright New World?
[01:17:52.007 --> 01:17:52.687]  Yes, I have.
[01:17:52.707 --> 01:18:01.029]  And what's happening with these vaccines is that it's so simple is that they were given these children multiple dose vaccines, okay?
[01:18:01.389 --> 01:18:08.711]  When you go to the doctor and you see a bottle of vaccine, that vaccine can take, you know, 10 to 15 vaccines per bottle.
[01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:12.112]  Well, the pharmaceutical industry, you know, being
[01:18:12.748 --> 01:18:23.338]  You know, bottom line, happy as they are, they realized that they could cut their costs substantially by using multiple dose bottles instead of single dose bottles that would not have to have been preserved with the mercury in the first place.
[01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:32.046]  Very sad news, but when you look at 43 million children in this country born between 86 and 1999, you multiply that by 21 mandated vaccines times $70 per shot,
[01:18:38.835 --> 01:18:44.820]  It gets into over 60 billion dollars that this industry made as a result of a federally mandated program.
[01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:49.484]  And once they have neurological problems, the schools are going to hop them up on drugs.
[01:18:49.744 --> 01:18:51.105]  We'll be right back, stay with us please.
[01:18:53.544 --> 01:18:56.827]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:18:56.887 --> 01:19:01.050]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:04.112]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:19:04.292 --> 01:19:06.694]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:19:06.874 --> 01:19:15.541]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:19:15.721 --> 01:19:17.062]  The Brookie light is different.
[01:19:17.262 --> 01:19:21.425]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:19:21.765 --> 01:19:22.266]  We're good to go!
[01:19:50.623 --> 01:19:52.223]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:53.164 --> 01:19:57.885]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:19:58.105 --> 01:20:01.545]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:20:01.765 --> 01:20:04.226]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:13.068]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.

[01:20:58.803 --> 01:20:59.524]  You heard that right.
[01:20:59.724 --> 01:21:02.507]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[01:21:02.667 --> 01:21:03.948]  You don't have to pay them off.
[01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:05.570]  The banks are defrauding you.
[01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:07.192]  Now is the time to fight back.
[01:21:07.432 --> 01:21:10.034]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[01:21:10.215 --> 01:21:13.458]  The procedure's easy and everything is done legally and within the law.

[01:21:55.478 --> 01:21:59.302]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:21:59.622 --> 01:22:00.443]  Read the labels.
[01:22:00.883 --> 01:22:05.007]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:05.227 --> 01:22:09.430]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:14.675]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[01:22:54.495 --> 01:22:59.638]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.318 --> 01:23:02.680]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.921]  We have interviewed Congressman Dan Barton.
[01:23:06.622 --> 01:23:07.282]  I've interviewed
[01:23:09.964 --> 01:23:13.547]  Multiple brain experts, epidemiologists, the list goes on and on.
[01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:17.710]  My friends, they know what the marisol is doing.
[01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:23.815]  So they've taken it out of some, but then strangely enough, even in single vaccines, radically increased the level.
[01:23:25.076 --> 01:23:26.297]  For no reason, by the way.
[01:23:26.317 --> 01:23:27.718]  It's not even needed for preservatives.
[01:23:28.579 --> 01:23:29.659]  Why are they doing that?
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:37.766]  Again, once the children are brain damaged, then they show neurological problems, then the schools, under the new Freedom Initiative, hop them up on other drugs.
[01:23:38.726 --> 01:23:40.408]  And they make tens of billions of dollars.
[01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:43.211]  This is all by design.
[01:23:43.511 --> 01:23:44.933]  And it's a nightmare.
[01:23:44.953 --> 01:23:46.975]  And we're talking to Courtney Zitzke.
[01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:49.117]  His son was damaged by all of this.
[01:23:50.038 --> 01:23:54.162]  And locally here on the Austin News, you've got to have your vaccines to go to school.
[01:23:54.242 --> 01:23:54.983]  Get them, get them, get them.
[01:23:55.243 --> 01:23:58.106]  When in truth, there's a law that they can't make you take them to go to school.
[01:23:58.146 --> 01:24:00.469]  They've got a conscientious objector waiver.
[01:24:01.195 --> 01:24:03.376]  They know that, and every state's got it.
[01:24:03.757 --> 01:24:05.017]  But they try to lie.
[01:24:05.438 --> 01:24:05.798]  Why?
[01:24:05.858 --> 01:24:09.820]  Because it's a $60 billion industry, just as our guest just said.
[01:24:10.501 --> 01:24:20.487]  Courtney, continuing with this, as you began to find this out, your baby's fine, then gets problems after it gets the shots, you began to research.
[01:24:21.167 --> 01:24:23.108]  What was it like for you to discover this?
[01:24:23.609 --> 01:24:24.769]  Well, it was very disturbing.
[01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:30.773]  The deeper one digs into this, the more disturbing this whole thing starts to look.
[01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:44.030]  I started to realize that the pharmaceutical companies knew for a very, very long time that thimerazole would eventually cause brain damage in children.
[01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:51.032]  And I think the problem really occurred when they started to require that children receive three and four vaccines per doctor's visit.
[01:24:51.690 --> 01:24:57.513]  But the more one digs into this potential, this problem, the worse it really starts to look.
[01:25:04.170 --> 01:25:08.593]  Giving them shots, period, damages them, hurts them, makes them sick, makes them feel bad.
[01:25:08.753 --> 01:25:12.016]  But when you give them a lot, it damages them big time so you notice.
[01:25:12.076 --> 01:25:13.457]  So, this is bad, period.
[01:25:13.777 --> 01:25:14.558]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:25:14.598 --> 01:25:22.563]  In fact, you know, in most places in Europe, most countries in Europe, they will not vaccinate a child until they're at least five or six years old.
[01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:25.505]  And then they'll do it over a period of a very long time.
[01:25:25.546 --> 01:25:27.167]  They have a law in Japan until they're two.
[01:25:27.427 --> 01:25:28.508]  That is correct, yeah.
[01:25:28.628 --> 01:25:32.971]  But we're kooks if you don't want to give your newborn baby deadly vaccines at birth.
[01:25:33.982 --> 01:25:35.283]  Well, that's what they make you think.
[01:25:35.884 --> 01:25:40.088]  They kind of browbeat you into vaccinating your children as soon as possible.
[01:25:41.449 --> 01:25:46.514]  And unfortunately, you know, the thimerosal is more deadly than the vaccine itself.
[01:25:48.396 --> 01:25:49.437]  Very, very bad stuff.
[01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:52.480]  You mean more deadly than the possible diseases they could give?
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.381]  Oh, no question about it.
[01:25:53.521 --> 01:25:57.425]  I mean, look, I had measles and mumps when I was a child and it didn't kill me.
[01:25:58.208 --> 01:26:02.289]  But yet they're giving these children measles, mumps, rubella, all in one rolled shot.
[01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:04.370]  It's damaging children.
[01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:10.512]  Let me add this, Mr. Zitzke, whose son was again damaged by this, and he's written the book Mercury, The Wing, The Messenger.
[01:26:11.992 --> 01:26:17.454]  Think about this, if they'll put all this mercury in there, and put extra in there for some reason,
[01:26:18.112 --> 01:26:22.776]  What do you think the manufacturing process is with the viruses and bacteria and things?
[01:26:23.136 --> 01:26:28.501]  I mean, if they don't care about your child to do this knowingly for decades, then what else do you think they're doing with those vaccines?
[01:26:29.181 --> 01:26:30.803]  Boy, that's really difficult to tell.
[01:26:30.843 --> 01:26:40.150]  I mean, you know, what's happened is that a lot of the vaccines that we feel is unnecessary, that contains the thimerosal, they've shipped to the third world countries.
[01:26:41.591 --> 01:26:45.895]  So you're going to see a pattern of mercury damage, neurological damage in children,
[01:26:46.597 --> 01:26:50.059]  Uh, in neurological, you know, in third world countries very soon.
[01:26:50.199 --> 01:27:02.004]  And again, they admit it, they know it, and if you went down the street and grabbed a child and banged their head in the concrete, which would be horrible, until they were brain damaged, you would be given attempted murder, 40 years in prison, and you should be.
[01:27:02.364 --> 01:27:03.344]  You should be executed.
[01:27:03.624 --> 01:27:07.146]  But our government and these vaccine makers do it, and it's a loving good thing.
[01:27:07.446 --> 01:27:09.687]  Well, what's happened is, is that the government
[01:27:10.499 --> 01:27:10.860]  I think so.
[01:27:28.726 --> 01:27:30.607]  Find out what really happened to their child.
[01:27:30.948 --> 01:27:34.070]  The statute of limitations in a vaccine court would have already run out.
[01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:41.575]  And consequently, there's been many, many lawsuits that have been filed that have been forced into this vaccine court that have been dismissed.
[01:27:42.216 --> 01:27:43.657]  That's unconstitutional.
[01:27:44.317 --> 01:27:47.460]  Well, it's like with the genetically modified foods.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:50.602]  Monsanto literally has its own federal court in St.
[01:27:50.642 --> 01:27:50.962]  Louis.
[01:27:50.982 --> 01:27:52.523]  I mean, they have all their own little courts.
[01:27:53.004 --> 01:27:53.364]  Of course.
[01:27:54.415 --> 01:27:57.598]  Of course, and the vaccine injury court's the same way.
[01:27:58.158 --> 01:28:04.924]  If I were to go up to somebody's child and hit them in the head with a 2x4 and cause brain damage, would I be taken to a 2x4 court of law?
[01:28:05.165 --> 01:28:05.385]  No.
[01:28:05.805 --> 01:28:07.887]  I would be taken to criminal court and prosecuted.
[01:28:07.907 --> 01:28:12.972]  And what's the difference between a 2x4 and a syringe loaded with mercury?
[01:28:14.453 --> 01:28:15.534]  Very, very sad stuff.
[01:28:16.881 --> 01:28:17.701]  Unbelievable.
[01:28:18.041 --> 01:28:22.103]  I want to take calls on this subject and get more into your book and what it covers and tell them about your website.
[01:28:22.143 --> 01:28:25.524]  But if you want to talk about this issue, we're going to go to your calls pretty quick here.
[01:28:25.544 --> 01:28:25.664]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:25.684 --> 01:28:25.744]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:33.226 --> 01:28:36.527]  And we'll give you Mr. Zitzke's website when we get back on the other side.
[01:28:36.567 --> 01:28:37.087]  But again, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:37.227 --> 01:28:41.249]  What are my websites?
[01:28:41.409 --> 01:28:43.590]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:44.450]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:46.551]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.471 --> 01:28:50.132]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.445 --> 01:28:54.365]  Attention, investors.
[01:28:54.525 --> 01:28:59.266]  Are you looking for above-average returns and willing to take a risk in order to achieve them?
[01:28:59.486 --> 01:29:03.727]  I'm Patrick T. Parker from Barclay Financial, a specialty firm in futures and options.
[01:29:03.887 --> 01:29:06.668]  Now, I know that futures and options are a mystery to most people.
[01:29:07.048 --> 01:29:13.730]  Let us help you solve that mystery because futures and options investing involves substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.
[01:29:14.190 --> 01:29:19.811]  Right now, we're making a major recommendation in the grain markets, particularly wheat, soybeans, and corn.
[01:29:20.451 --> 01:29:23.833]  Weather conditions exist right now over many key growing areas.
[01:29:24.373 --> 01:29:26.514]  Grain prices have been extremely volatile.
[01:29:26.954 --> 01:29:31.377]  Demand from the Asian market, specifically China, has been rising dramatically.
[01:29:31.837 --> 01:29:36.479]  Remember, currently no market news may be factored into the price of the underlying markets.
[01:29:36.839 --> 01:29:38.360]  Discover the possibilities.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.563]  Call Barclay Financial for a free audio, video, or CD-ROM on options investing.
[01:29:43.963 --> 01:29:44.184]  Call 1-800-914-3223.
[01:29:44.204 --> 01:29:44.464]  That's 1-800-914-3223.
[01:29:44.484 --> 01:29:45.106]  Barclay Financial.
[01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:45.707]  Mystery Solved!
[01:29:52.916 --> 01:29:58.141]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:58.281 --> 01:30:06.388]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:06.628 --> 01:30:13.694]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:13.874 --> 01:30:15.135]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:30:15.215 --> 01:30:21.119]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:21.319 --> 01:30:26.403]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:26.523 --> 01:30:35.389]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:39.172]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:30:41.053 --> 01:30:41.373]  We're good.
[01:30:52.831 --> 01:30:53.832]  It's finally here!
[01:30:53.952 --> 01:30:54.972]  Spring has arrived!
[01:30:55.133 --> 01:30:58.095]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:58.335 --> 01:31:01.777]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:01.997 --> 01:31:10.162]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:31:10.402 --> 01:31:11.183]  With Ark's heirloom
[01:31:11.463 --> 01:31:14.145]  You can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:31:14.345 --> 01:31:19.389]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:31:19.649 --> 01:31:24.173]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:31:24.353 --> 01:31:28.416]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:31:28.496 --> 01:31:35.702]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce, and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[01:31:35.942 --> 01:31:37.243]  Save money, eat healthy.
[01:31:37.463 --> 01:31:41.387]  Grow your own delicious, secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[01:31:41.587 --> 01:31:43.508]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[01:31:43.569 --> 01:31:45.570]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[01:32:05.982 --> 01:32:13.485]  We're about to go back to Courtney Zitzke, whose son was damaged by the mercury, the Marisol preservative in his book, Mercury the Winged Messenger.
[01:32:13.505 --> 01:32:16.986]  I'll tell you how to get that and we'll go to John and Stacey and many others.

[01:32:22.012 --> 01:32:25.233]  I wanted to tell you about Ruddy Reserve Foods, folks.
[01:32:25.253 --> 01:32:27.173]  They've got a bunch of different specials going.
[01:32:28.294 --> 01:32:30.234]  I've ordered food, I've gotten it, I love it.

[01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:54.023]  Just call and ask them to get a brochure or about information.
[01:32:54.783 --> 01:32:57.845]  Give Ready Reserve Foods a call, folks.

[01:33:07.831 --> 01:33:11.014]  In case there ever is a breakdown of society or a big terror attack.
[01:33:11.115 --> 01:33:12.876]  The government stores foods.
[01:33:12.896 --> 01:33:14.218]  The government does this.
[01:33:14.278 --> 01:33:15.479]  We cannot trust these people.
[01:33:15.519 --> 01:33:17.521]  We've got to be self-sufficient.
[01:33:18.222 --> 01:33:20.264]  And I endorse Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:33:20.344 --> 01:33:21.085]  I think they're great.
[01:33:21.345 --> 01:33:21.945]  Give them a call.
[01:33:21.965 --> 01:33:22.005]  800-453-2202.

[01:33:41.677 --> 01:33:43.077]  Just at least get the information.
[01:33:43.878 --> 01:33:46.098]  Also, you know I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[01:33:47.198 --> 01:33:48.659]  And I've made ten films.
[01:33:49.179 --> 01:33:49.999]  I've written a book on 9-11.
[01:33:50.059 --> 01:33:52.840]  I've published another great book on government-sponsored terror.
[01:33:53.747 --> 01:34:00.330]  And I carry a bunch of other great videos and books and books on tape and pro-gun t-shirts and InfoWars.com bumper stickers.
[01:34:00.930 --> 01:34:03.632]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:03.892 --> 01:34:06.193]  Peruse the SecureSafe online shopping cart.
[01:34:06.513 --> 01:34:07.814]  Watch clips of the different films.
[01:34:07.994 --> 01:34:08.834]  Order my videos.
[01:34:09.094 --> 01:34:11.975]  Make copies of my videos for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:34:12.316 --> 01:34:13.556]  Air them on Axis Television.
[01:34:13.796 --> 01:34:14.797]  Get them out to people.
[01:34:14.817 --> 01:34:16.277]  They're having a huge effect.
[01:34:16.778 --> 01:34:19.239]  Ninety percent of those that see the films are waking up.
[01:34:19.679 --> 01:34:21.580]  I do radio interviews every day.
[01:34:22.196 --> 01:34:26.326]  And about half the time I do an interview, they take calls and callers call in who've seen the videos.
[01:34:26.647 --> 01:34:27.750]  And I'll say, where'd you get it?
[01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:29.534]  Oh, my neighbor gave me a copy of a copy.
[01:34:30.015 --> 01:34:30.978]  And I think that's great!
[01:34:31.742 --> 01:34:32.823]  So you're having an effect.
[01:34:32.843 --> 01:34:34.784]  Those of you that have gotten the films, I want to thank you.
[01:34:35.085 --> 01:34:38.167]  Those that haven't and haven't made copies, make some copies and get them out to people.
[01:34:38.467 --> 01:34:41.569]  But if you haven't ordered them, now is the time to take action.
[01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:45.972]  These are well done, professionally produced, shocking films that give you the big picture.
[01:34:46.373 --> 01:34:54.519]  Whether it's 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, or Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, or Police State, Three Total Enslavement, or Matrix of Evil, you need to have them.

[01:35:02.043 --> 01:35:03.864]  There are 24 hours a day.
[01:35:03.904 --> 01:35:07.465]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:35:07.505 --> 01:35:09.066]  Or order at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:09.086 --> 01:35:09.766]  Please take action!
[01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:34.334]  Courtney Zitzke, again I've written the book, Mercury the Winged Messenger.
[01:35:34.394 --> 01:35:42.741]  Tell us about your website and about the book and let's talk a little bit more about it and then let's, why you decided to write the book and then let's go to the calls.
[01:35:43.241 --> 01:35:51.228]  Okay, well basically the book, I wrote the book after I've done extensive research on this American, basically what I call an atrocity.
[01:35:52.345 --> 01:35:58.147]  And the reason I wrote the book is simply because I wanted people to understand the magnitude of what the damage to these children are.
[01:35:59.307 --> 01:36:12.252]  The autism epidemic has exploded in the last 15 years, and I figured that people would want to know the truth about what is behind this.
[01:36:12.832 --> 01:36:15.733]  The website is through AuthorHouse, the publisher.
[01:36:16.596 --> 01:36:17.676]  Authorhouse.com.
[01:36:18.337 --> 01:36:23.138]  Just type in Mercury the Winged Messenger on the search engine and it'll take you right to the book page.
[01:36:23.718 --> 01:36:29.660]  The book can be purchased through most online booksellers, Barnes & Noble, Amazon.
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.121]  Just type in the title of the book and it'll pop you right there.
[01:36:33.461 --> 01:36:34.922]  It's pretty well wide distributed now.
[01:36:37.522 --> 01:36:42.644]  Are you finding, I mean, just five years ago you said vaccines are poisonous, people laugh at you, now
[01:36:43.919 --> 01:36:53.465]  They said in the local paper that fully 20% plus of Austin school children had had none of the vaccines.
[01:36:53.585 --> 01:36:54.806]  The parents were refusing.
[01:36:55.226 --> 01:36:56.667]  So they had a propaganda blitz.
[01:36:56.707 --> 01:36:57.788]  I've seen a national too.
[01:36:58.008 --> 01:36:58.709]  You must take it.
[01:36:58.769 --> 01:36:59.289]  It's the law.
[01:36:59.309 --> 01:37:00.250]  To go to school you have to.
[01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:01.751]  No, the law is you don't.
[01:37:01.791 --> 01:37:02.951]  And they've all got the waiver.
[01:37:03.252 --> 01:37:06.554]  But we've seen this media lying campaign to push it.
[01:37:06.594 --> 01:37:08.115]  But I do see an awakening taking place.
[01:37:08.135 --> 01:37:09.896]  I think we're starting to turn the corner.
[01:37:09.936 --> 01:37:11.637]  I think they're being exposed.
[01:37:12.237 --> 01:37:13.097]  Well, I think so.
[01:37:13.577 --> 01:37:15.798]  I mean, numbers don't lie.
[01:37:17.058 --> 01:37:21.139]  The autism epidemic, sadly enough, has been proven.
[01:37:21.499 --> 01:37:22.159]  It's the mercury.
[01:37:22.919 --> 01:37:24.120]  People are starting to see this.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:28.400]  The mainstream media is picking up on it, and people are starting to ask a lot of questions.
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:35.722]  Hey, what are you putting in these syringes that I'm giving to a two to three month old baby?
[01:37:37.098 --> 01:37:42.683]  The sad part about this is that these children didn't have a choice of any part of this tragedy.
[01:37:43.144 --> 01:37:46.266]  And the parents were, you know, hey, it's the government.
[01:37:46.287 --> 01:37:47.127]  We trust the government.
[01:37:47.247 --> 01:37:48.108]  They know what's best.
[01:37:48.989 --> 01:37:50.150]  You go to your pediatrician.
[01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:51.531]  He's a licensed doctor.
[01:37:51.591 --> 01:37:52.652]  You think he's, you know.
[01:37:53.273 --> 01:37:59.218]  And the sad part about it, the doctors didn't even know about the thimerosal problem until probably a couple years ago.
[01:37:59.838 --> 01:38:02.701]  They started to ask a lot of questions because word started to come out.
[01:38:03.507 --> 01:38:09.190]  They were told by the pharmaceutical companies that these vaccines are necessary for all children, federal and state mandates.
[01:38:09.871 --> 01:38:13.453]  So people followed what was recommended to them.
[01:38:14.053 --> 01:38:17.155]  Nobody wants to see a child develop polio or any other disease.
[01:38:18.436 --> 01:38:21.098]  But then again, people are starting to think, well, wait a minute.
[01:38:21.838 --> 01:38:24.720]  They're playing Russian roulettes with these shots loaded with mercury.
[01:38:25.353 --> 01:38:26.734]  And it's a tragedy what's happened.
[01:38:27.115 --> 01:38:31.058]  People don't realize the magnitude of this problem.
[01:38:31.538 --> 01:38:38.023]  And if you have an autistic child, you know very well what the problem is, and it just breaks your heart.
[01:38:40.666 --> 01:38:41.426]  Absolutely.
[01:38:43.288 --> 01:38:44.189]  Again, it's official.
[01:38:44.269 --> 01:38:44.749]  It's admitted.
[01:38:44.769 --> 01:38:46.771]  And the vaccines are only one part of this.
[01:38:47.051 --> 01:38:49.313]  The mercury and the vaccines are only one part of this.
[01:38:51.274 --> 01:38:52.415]  Folks, it's your children.
[01:38:52.495 --> 01:38:53.036]  It's willing...
[01:38:54.324 --> 01:38:55.947]  You should be willing to fight against this.
[01:38:55.987 --> 01:38:58.230]  You should be willing to stand up against this.
[01:38:58.411 --> 01:39:01.175]  It's a lot more than just the Mercury folks.
[01:39:01.215 --> 01:39:03.619]  A lot of the politics behind this is really ugly.
[01:39:05.522 --> 01:39:08.346]  There's been a lot of stuff written about it.
[01:39:09.833 --> 01:39:25.867]  That I wrote basically puts all the information together so people can draw their own conclusions and the conclusions will be pretty, you know, what I drew and most people will come to the same conclusion that it is the mercury, the government knew about it and they've attempted to cover it up.
[01:39:27.528 --> 01:39:32.653]  And then bizarrely enough they've taken it out a few vaccines but then radically increased it in single shots.
[01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:34.410]  When there's no reason.
[01:39:34.691 --> 01:39:42.754]  Oh, we're putting four, five, six, seven, eight times what it was before in a triple shot, in a single shot, and by the way, it's hurting adults too, folks.
[01:39:42.774 --> 01:39:43.614]  Sure, certainly it is.
[01:39:44.235 --> 01:39:48.116]  But I mean, and they don't tell you, well, we say, why have you actually increased it?
[01:39:48.356 --> 01:39:49.897]  Shut up, we're not going to discuss it.
[01:39:51.578 --> 01:39:52.458]  Folks, this is admitted.
[01:39:52.538 --> 01:39:54.479]  We have all of it posted on the websites.
[01:39:55.279 --> 01:39:56.540]  Let's go to John in Texas.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:57.480]  John, you're on the air.
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:57.820]  Welcome.
[01:39:58.801 --> 01:39:59.061]  Hello, Alex.
[01:39:59.541 --> 01:39:59.841]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:00.201 --> 01:40:01.862]  Makes me glad that I never got a flu shot.
[01:40:02.947 --> 01:40:11.310]  You know, when I was growing up in the fifties, I had all the childhood diseases, mumps, measles, chicken pox, and all you did was you stayed home for a few days and that was it.
[01:40:11.931 --> 01:40:15.292]  I never had any lasting damage and my friends never had any lasting damage from it.
[01:40:15.912 --> 01:40:17.793]  So why would they have to take all these shots now?
[01:40:20.654 --> 01:40:26.237]  Well, actually, you know, vaccines are, if we had angels running it, would work for some things.
[01:40:26.857 --> 01:40:28.537]  Especially, you know, stuff that will kill you.
[01:40:28.938 --> 01:40:29.738]  But here's the problem.
[01:40:30.547 --> 01:40:37.115]  Because I've seen from all over the Western world, and the graphs are all basically identical, 98% similar.
[01:40:37.836 --> 01:40:41.481]  Because of better sewage and hygiene and nutrition,
[01:40:42.313 --> 01:40:47.114]  About a hundred years ago, disease starts plunging in the Western world straight down.
[01:40:47.694 --> 01:40:48.714]  And it drops down over 90%.
[01:40:49.995 --> 01:40:54.876]  Then vaccinations become widespread in the fifties, and actually disease rates go back up a little bit.
[01:40:55.176 --> 01:40:59.816]  Not the previous levels, but back up about 10-15% depending on the country.
[01:41:00.337 --> 01:41:03.737]  So actually a lot of this isn't the vaccines, it's hygiene and nutrition.
[01:41:04.277 --> 01:41:06.998]  But then they say, oh look, it's all the vaccines, they've done this.
[01:41:08.677 --> 01:41:09.838]  And that's just the facts.
[01:41:09.878 --> 01:41:12.661]  That's just the scientific statistics and numbers.
[01:41:13.962 --> 01:41:20.767]  And then now, Big Pharma runs Washington, and runs Europe, and runs New Zealand and Australia.
[01:41:21.717 --> 01:41:27.263]  And, uh, you know, now it's not 21 vaccines, it's 35 vaccines, and they're on track to have 40-plus vaccines.
[01:41:27.523 --> 01:41:32.088]  They're gonna try to make, oh, vaccines so you never get addicted to drugs that change brain chemistry.
[01:41:32.328 --> 01:41:33.849]  Vaccines so you don't have earaches.
[01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:35.751]  Vaccines so you're not angry.
[01:41:35.811 --> 01:41:43.219]  I mean, now these mind-control vaccines, England's about to recommend that they force children to take vaccines that change brain chemistry.
[01:41:43.819 --> 01:41:46.121]  I mean, this is a tool of social control.
[01:41:46.401 --> 01:41:48.143]  This is done by design.
[01:41:48.423 --> 01:41:51.205]  Most children just get dumbed down, lose 20 IQ points.
[01:41:51.626 --> 01:41:55.509]  You've got a child who would have been 120 points above average, they're going to be 100 pointer.
[01:41:55.929 --> 01:42:00.152]  You've got a child who's just going to be maybe 140 points.
[01:42:00.372 --> 01:42:03.355]  A high level, they have a bad reaction, they go down to 80 IQ points.
[01:42:03.795 --> 01:42:07.138]  This is by design, and maybe Mr. Zitzke can't handle that.
[01:42:07.798 --> 01:42:10.261]  The more he researches, he will see that's the truth.
[01:42:10.281 --> 01:42:11.421]  Maybe you can't handle that.
[01:42:11.662 --> 01:42:12.703]  But this is by design.
[01:42:12.723 --> 01:42:13.924]  I have official government plans.
[01:42:14.584 --> 01:42:15.525]  Anything else, John?
[01:42:16.587 --> 01:42:19.408]  No, I just was going to ask if there's a program to stop all this.
[01:42:19.468 --> 01:42:20.588]  Are these people liable?
[01:42:20.628 --> 01:42:21.508]  Can they be sued?
[01:42:21.828 --> 01:42:31.590]  Well, see, they knew, so decades ago, they set up the vaccine damage federal body over two billion dollars, and it's all their judges, their corrupt systems, and so it's all a setup.
[01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:34.371]  They preemptively prepare for your backlash.
[01:42:34.971 --> 01:42:35.931]  Comments, Mr. Zitzke?
[01:42:36.512 --> 01:42:42.593]  Well, that's why they have the Vaccine Injury Court of Law, with its very convenient three-year statute of limitations.
[01:42:43.655 --> 01:42:51.180]  By design, any suit that's filed in the United States on behalf of a vaccine-injured child is forced into a vaccine injury court.
[01:42:52.461 --> 01:42:59.346]  The Congress said that it was designed to speed up claims and speed up the payment schedule for damaged children.
[01:42:59.766 --> 01:43:07.651]  In actuality, it does exactly the opposite, because you're going against the pharmaceutical companies and the federal government in a court.
[01:43:08.572 --> 01:43:11.654]  They have unlimited funds of which to defend this litigation.
[01:43:12.754 --> 01:43:19.136]  The maximum amount you can receive in the so-called Court of Justice is $250,000 plus court fees.
[01:43:20.157 --> 01:43:27.440]  Well, that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what it's going to take to fix and to care for these injured children for the course of their lives.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:32.802]  These children will not be able to go to college, they'll not fall in love, they'll not be able to drive a car.
[01:43:33.342 --> 01:43:35.983]  These children are pretty much damaged for the rest of their lives.
[01:43:37.871 --> 01:43:41.353]  But hey, if your child escapes the mercury, we'll just give them Ritalin and Prozac by law.
[01:43:41.913 --> 01:43:51.740]  Have you heard of the New Freedom Initiative, where they're going to force all children twice a year and then all adults, already starting in Illinois with pregnant women, to go under social worker control, forced drugging.
[01:43:52.001 --> 01:43:54.162]  I mean, this is worse than the Soviet Union.
[01:43:54.342 --> 01:43:56.104]  Oh yeah, well, it's terrible.
[01:43:56.624 --> 01:43:57.264]  But it's freedom.
[01:43:57.304 --> 01:43:57.925]  It's new freedom.
[01:43:57.945 --> 01:43:58.725]  You're not for freedom.
[01:44:00.967 --> 01:44:03.569]  Freedom from having your mind, Courtney.
[01:44:03.889 --> 01:44:04.289]  Exactly.
[01:44:04.329 --> 01:44:05.090]  No, I understand that.
[01:44:05.743 --> 01:44:06.966]  Hey John, thanks for the call.
[01:44:07.386 --> 01:44:08.649]  Stacey in Illinois.
[01:44:08.669 --> 01:44:09.891]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:44:09.931 --> 01:44:12.436]  Go ahead Stacey.
[01:44:12.537 --> 01:44:17.687]  Yeah, I'm in Illinois and I'm actually nine months pregnant at the moment with our first child.
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.722]  So it was funny that you mentioned these new laws.
[01:44:20.742 --> 01:44:22.724]  Be confident, be controlled.
[01:44:24.545 --> 01:44:26.027]  When you're in there, just act normal.
[01:44:26.687 --> 01:44:29.309]  Just say, no, we're not taking any vaccines.
[01:44:29.349 --> 01:44:30.370]  You'll sign the form.
[01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:36.996]  Well, what I was going to tell you is that my husband and I, based on the research we've done, have decided not to vaccinate this child or any of our future children.
[01:44:37.256 --> 01:44:40.057]  You're not going, let me stop you, you're not going to a city hospital, are you?
[01:44:40.297 --> 01:44:42.077]  No, no, I'm actually doing a home birth.
[01:44:42.317 --> 01:44:51.318]  Yeah, that may hit you hard with SWAT teams, and I'm not joking, even though it's not the law, we've had SWAT team guys grab women by the throat and go, sign the document, we're taking the child!
[01:44:51.599 --> 01:44:54.719]  I'm not kidding, I've been there with video cameras in Austin, go ahead.
[01:44:54.739 --> 01:45:05.801]  And there are jokers who have called Child Protective Services on women who give birth at home, which is, you know... Folks, folks, I'm not joking, we've been there in Austin where they grab the woman around the neck and say, sign it, sign it!
[01:45:07.069 --> 01:45:08.390]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:45:08.410 --> 01:45:18.158]  The comment, actually what I would like to have Courtney speak about, there is a larger moral issue here with vaccinations that I'd like to have him address.
[01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:23.422]  And it's not just the poisoning issue that, you know, the health damages that are done to your children.
[01:45:23.883 --> 01:45:25.244]  It's also the fact that
[01:45:25.885 --> 01:45:33.211]  All of the major pharmaceutical companies, Merck & Company, SmithKline, Beecham, Conant Laboratories that produce these vaccines.
[01:45:33.331 --> 01:45:38.215]  Let's call them by their proper names, Satan, Beelzebub, Astaroth, Baphomet.
[01:45:38.435 --> 01:45:48.483]  They all have the majority of these vaccinations produced from a medium made of aborted human fetal tissue cell lines.
[01:45:49.504 --> 01:45:52.206]  I would like to have him talk about that a little bit because
[01:45:52.759 --> 01:45:55.840]  As we know, this is obviously a direct violation of God's law.
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:02.523]  And you cannot commit an act that is an inherent evil in order to affect a perceived good.
[01:46:02.623 --> 01:46:05.664]  And this is the same reason why stem cell research is wrong.
[01:46:05.704 --> 01:46:07.565]  So I'd like to hear Courtney talk a little bit about
[01:46:08.055 --> 01:46:11.796]  The fact that these vaccinations are also made from aborted fetal tissue.
[01:46:11.816 --> 01:46:12.856]  Were you aware of that, sir?
[01:46:13.276 --> 01:46:13.817]  Yes, I am.
[01:46:14.217 --> 01:46:18.798]  In fact, there's a lot of medicines that are made by aborted fetal tissue.
[01:46:19.098 --> 01:46:21.719]  But isn't that freedom of where we use dead babies?
[01:46:22.259 --> 01:46:26.200]  Well... Isn't that a good sign of freedom and a good society where you use dead babies for stuff?
[01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:29.061]  Well, I'm... I'm being sarcastic.
[01:46:29.101 --> 01:46:31.081]  I'm just illustrating how sick we are.
[01:46:31.301 --> 01:46:33.722]  I think that the moral issue involved is terrible.
[01:46:34.735 --> 01:46:36.897]  You cannot take a life to save a life.
[01:46:37.157 --> 01:46:48.105]  My feeling is that anytime you harm somebody with the benefit of another, you're doing not only the people involved a disservice, but you're doing a disservice to humanity.
[01:46:49.466 --> 01:46:53.049]  The moral implications of what she is talking about are profound.
[01:46:53.970 --> 01:46:56.892]  My feeling is that two wrongs do not make a right.
[01:46:58.803 --> 01:47:11.578]  You know, I mean, you can get into the moral people that are pro or cons on any of this and, uh, you know, my personal feeling and my personal belief is that they've got to be a little bit more forthcoming of the information.
[01:47:12.719 --> 01:47:17.301]  People can find the information, but are they forthright in the information that they're giving to the public?
[01:47:17.441 --> 01:47:20.083]  And I have to say that they're definitely not.
[01:47:20.443 --> 01:47:25.186]  Well, if you go in the hospital and don't know your rights, they're going to bully the daylights out of you because they're mandated to do it.
[01:47:25.366 --> 01:47:28.707]  Their bosses have made $60,000 off this, as you said.
[01:47:29.007 --> 01:47:39.433]  Yeah, well, in the course of Ian, he was not more than five minutes old, and they were popping a hepatitis B injection into this newborn baby that's five minutes old.
[01:47:40.134 --> 01:47:44.496]  And even that vaccine was loaded with thimerazole.
[01:47:46.297 --> 01:47:46.817]  I hear you.
[01:47:47.218 --> 01:47:47.718]  Alright.
[01:47:49.019 --> 01:47:52.280]  He's five minutes old and he gets a hepatitis B vaccine.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.942]  A hepatitis B vaccination right out of the womb?
[01:47:55.662 --> 01:47:56.963]  That's why I'm giving birth at home.
[01:47:57.503 --> 01:47:58.383]  That's a good idea.
[01:47:58.403 --> 01:48:00.885]  Alright, thank you for the call Stacy.
[01:48:01.205 --> 01:48:02.205]  Good luck, God bless you.
[01:48:02.846 --> 01:48:04.887]  Tim in Colorado, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:48:04.907 --> 01:48:06.928]  Hey Mr. Jones?
[01:48:07.188 --> 01:48:07.448]  Yes sir.
[01:48:07.992 --> 01:48:12.063]  God bless you, God bless you too, and your son Ian, your family.
[01:48:13.607 --> 01:48:16.194]  I had a question about how to obtain the waiver.
[01:48:16.914 --> 01:48:19.996]  Without having social services take your child from you at the hospital?
[01:48:20.317 --> 01:48:22.638]  Well, they don't, 98% of the time.
[01:48:22.738 --> 01:48:25.841]  If you seem ignorant, and they can intimidate you, they will.
[01:48:26.121 --> 01:48:29.783]  You just, number one, you find a doctor, you talk to the hospital, the doctor beforehand.
[01:48:29.803 --> 01:48:31.645]  A lot of these doctors have woken up to this.
[01:48:31.745 --> 01:48:35.468]  I've talked to doctors who would, half the children at some hospitals aren't doing it.
[01:48:36.248 --> 01:48:38.890]  We've gotten to the point where they don't act like you're crazy if you do this.
[01:48:39.591 --> 01:48:44.254]  And you just say, no vaccines, you stay with the child during the procedure, and it doesn't happen.
[01:48:45.231 --> 01:48:51.453]  Yeah, but I mean, you don't even have to have the waiver until you try to put them in school, and then that's when they try to force you to do this.
[01:48:51.893 --> 01:48:53.854]  Okay, and you get the waiver from the hospital?
[01:48:54.554 --> 01:48:54.854]  No, sir.
[01:48:54.874 --> 01:48:56.534]  You don't have to have a waiver at a hospital.
[01:48:56.995 --> 01:48:58.455]  I mean, where do you get the waiver?
[01:48:58.475 --> 01:49:02.696]  No, they have it at the health department and in every drawer at every nurse's office at the school.
[01:49:03.376 --> 01:49:04.157]  Okay, at the school?
[01:49:04.577 --> 01:49:06.877]  Okay, and I have one other question, sir.
[01:49:07.338 --> 01:49:11.899]  Is there a way you can find out if the vaccines they're giving your children have thimerosal in them?
[01:49:13.037 --> 01:49:13.397]  Yes.
[01:49:14.357 --> 01:49:16.498]  You want to take that question?
[01:49:16.658 --> 01:49:16.898]  Yes.
[01:49:17.018 --> 01:49:23.240]  In fact, you're going to want to insist that each vaccine is a single-dose vaccine.
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:29.441]  Do not let them give your child a vaccine from a multiple-dose bottle.
[01:49:29.961 --> 01:49:31.902]  Those are the ones that contain the thimerosal.
[01:49:32.535 --> 01:49:36.878]  And if you want to be absolutely sure, ask the physician or ask the nurse giving them the shot.
[01:49:37.318 --> 01:49:40.320]  You want to see the bottle and you want to see the inserts on that bottle.
[01:49:40.841 --> 01:49:41.801]  Well, I got a better idea.
[01:49:41.842 --> 01:49:43.303]  How about you don't take the vaccine?
[01:49:43.723 --> 01:49:47.605]  We'll be right back with our guests and more your calls.
[01:49:48.146 --> 01:49:49.087]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:49:49.147 --> 01:49:49.567]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.405 --> 01:50:00.251]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.571 --> 01:50:01.933]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.133 --> 01:50:04.335]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.495 --> 01:50:06.597]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.857 --> 01:50:11.801]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.

[01:50:18.266 --> 01:50:28.913]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.053 --> 01:50:30.954]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:52:55.978 --> 01:53:02.003]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.623 --> 01:53:05.606]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:09.749 --> 01:53:15.053]  And earlier when I said SWAT team police here in Austin, I mean militarized police, it wasn't the SWAT team.
[01:53:15.834 --> 01:53:18.196]  We were even down there with cameras one time when this happened to some people.
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:19.921]  And it's all intimidation.
[01:53:19.961 --> 01:53:21.102]  It's all color of law.
[01:53:21.262 --> 01:53:23.144]  And it's the law that you don't have to do this.
[01:53:23.924 --> 01:53:27.347]  But again, they're having to back off now because people are really waking up to this.
[01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:30.349]  And our guest has been with us the last 50 minutes.
[01:53:30.730 --> 01:53:32.971]  He may be able to stay with us a little bit into the next hour.
[01:53:33.031 --> 01:53:36.154]  We have loaded phone lines here with people wanting to talk to him.
[01:53:38.755 --> 01:53:48.999]  Well, we were talking about safe vaccines, but I mean it's not safe, it's just not a triple or quadruple dose of mercury at one time, it's spacing it out.
[01:53:49.659 --> 01:53:54.161]  I guess it's like only dropping your child from 20 feet instead of 50 feet on their head.
[01:53:54.181 --> 01:53:56.922]  I mean, I wouldn't give them the vaccines, period.
[01:53:57.726 --> 01:54:00.667]  But I guess you're saying look for vaccines that don't have the thimerosal now.
[01:54:00.987 --> 01:54:04.088]  I'm not going to trust an industry that's already done this and tried to cover it up.
[01:54:04.868 --> 01:54:05.988]  Courtney, what do you say to that?
[01:54:06.568 --> 01:54:13.450]  Well, I think that there's been enough people that have been, that have voiced their concerns and that they've addressed those concerns.
[01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:26.873]  And according to what information that's available, that they've phased it out and have eliminated it starting in 1999 and it was in the year 2001 that they publicly said that we've gotten it all out of the vaccines.
[01:54:27.819 --> 01:54:33.260]  But you don't know if there's any vaccines still on the shelves that still contain the virus.
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:37.501]  But wait a minute, I have news articles admitting that they've actually, in some vaccines, increased the level.
[01:54:37.761 --> 01:54:44.302]  Well, if that's the case, if that is the case, which it probably is, then obviously I wouldn't vaccinate my child.
[01:54:44.422 --> 01:54:45.142]  I wouldn't trust them.
[01:54:46.002 --> 01:54:49.343]  Well, I wouldn't trust them, but to begin with, sir, they're putting a bunch of other stuff in there.
[01:54:49.603 --> 01:54:50.803]  Yeah, well, I'm sure they are.
[01:54:51.223 --> 01:54:53.283]  Let's talk to Roberta in Colorado.
[01:54:53.363 --> 01:54:54.304]  Roberta, you're on the air.
[01:54:54.344 --> 01:54:54.784]  Go ahead.
[01:54:55.504 --> 01:54:55.884]  Hello?
[01:54:56.124 --> 01:54:56.524]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:54:57.105 --> 01:54:58.486]  Hey, um, good morning.
[01:54:58.646 --> 01:54:59.106]  Good morning.
[01:54:59.266 --> 01:55:05.751]  You know, I don't know, you've probably read this, but it's the unauthorized biography of Bush Sr., Bush 41.
[01:55:06.111 --> 01:55:06.371]  Yes.
[01:55:06.851 --> 01:55:10.093]  And there's a chapter, too, in there about race hygiene.
[01:55:11.234 --> 01:55:15.357]  And, you know, I've been reading it and it just is so scary and so sickening.
[01:55:15.497 --> 01:55:22.061]  Yeah, they funded the Nazis and they were the main money makers until 53 with all the Nazi money going back into their hands.
[01:55:22.101 --> 01:55:22.601]  You got it.
[01:55:22.802 --> 01:55:26.504]  And this just appears to be another branch of that philosophy and
[01:55:27.139 --> 01:55:34.583]  Well, Bush in the Homeland Security Bill two years ago got it passed that the vaccines have total liability protection.
[01:55:34.844 --> 01:55:36.124]  That did get reversed though.
[01:55:36.144 --> 01:55:37.465]  Were you aware of that, Courtney?
[01:55:37.685 --> 01:55:38.346]  Yes, I was.
[01:55:38.406 --> 01:55:42.068]  In fact, a big part of the book is about that, specifically.
[01:55:44.469 --> 01:55:47.191]  The pharmaceutical companies knew that there were going to be big problems.
[01:55:48.171 --> 01:55:52.454]  They knew that the people were waking up to this terrible tragedy.
[01:55:53.146 --> 01:56:02.452]  So that's why the current administration had put a last-minute provision on the Homeland Security Bill that specifically protected the pharmaceutical companies from liability.
[01:56:02.872 --> 01:56:07.595]  And the troubling factor is that Congress originally voted down the provision.
[01:56:08.995 --> 01:56:18.361]  They turned around at the very last moment, and it was inserted in there at the last moment, at the 11th hour, and nobody had realized what had happened.
[01:56:19.395 --> 01:56:20.936]  Um, until after the fact.
[01:56:21.397 --> 01:56:30.925]  And they, they, they actually, they literally tried to sneak this provision in that, that basically took all the liability out of, completely out of the equation.
[01:56:30.965 --> 01:56:32.326]  But the government wouldn't hurt us.
[01:56:32.366 --> 01:56:33.907]  They wouldn't hurt people knowingly.
[01:56:33.947 --> 01:56:37.410]  We could give up all our liberties to the new CIA director.
[01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:39.552]  Porter Goss is going to run our lives.
[01:56:39.612 --> 01:56:40.593]  Well, I'll tell ya.
[01:56:41.093 --> 01:56:43.214]  They wouldn't have prior knowledge in 9-11.
[01:56:43.354 --> 01:56:44.915]  They wouldn't do that.
[01:56:45.075 --> 01:56:51.218]  When people realized what had happened, basically a lot of stuff started to happen very quickly.
[01:56:51.998 --> 01:57:01.283]  The CDC document that confirmed the parents' fears on the mercury was intentionally buried and marked confidential.
[01:57:01.323 --> 01:57:02.023]  Do not copy.
[01:57:02.063 --> 01:57:02.783]  Do not release.
[01:57:04.584 --> 01:57:08.386]  These things just all happened together and the ultimate victims in this
[01:57:09.016 --> 01:57:10.716]  tragedy or your children.
[01:57:10.937 --> 01:57:13.077]  This is not a weapon of mass destruction issue.
[01:57:13.097 --> 01:57:14.817]  This is not an Iraq issue.
[01:57:14.837 --> 01:57:16.058]  This is not a political issue.
[01:57:16.578 --> 01:57:19.299]  This is an issue affecting American children.
[01:57:19.319 --> 01:57:19.759]  I hear you.
[01:57:19.899 --> 01:57:20.619]  We've got to break, sir.
[01:57:20.639 --> 01:57:21.699]  Will you stay with us a little bit more?
[01:57:21.779 --> 01:57:22.199]  Yes, I will.
[01:57:22.659 --> 01:57:24.160]  Okay, thanks for the call, Roberta.
[01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:26.120]  We'll go to Jeff and Steve and Brian and others.
[01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:27.241]  But listen to me.
[01:57:28.061 --> 01:57:32.602]  Imagine if Al-Qaeda was coming over here and brain-damaging hundreds of thousands of children.
[01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:33.821]  What would you do?
[01:57:33.841 --> 01:57:37.245]  But your government does it, and the vaccine makers do it, and you love them.
[01:57:37.565 --> 01:57:42.210]  And you local news reporters say we have to do this when there is no law, you lying scum!
[01:57:45.014 --> 01:57:46.095]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.059 --> 01:57:52.099]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:53.920]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:55.441]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.181 --> 01:57:57.081]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.742 --> 01:58:01.403]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.903 --> 01:58:06.045]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.147 --> 01:58:18.270]  There has never been a law that the government can put in your body whatever they want unless you join the military and waive your rights.
[01:58:19.051 --> 01:58:22.815]  For a terror of indentured servitude, and that's exactly what the military contract is.
[01:58:24.578 --> 01:58:31.566]  But still, they're not allowed to commit crimes in the military and knowingly poison you, and they admit they've done all sorts of chemical and biological testing on the troops.
[01:58:32.651 --> 01:58:33.912]  The government wouldn't do that.
[01:58:33.952 --> 01:58:35.273]  Well, they've admitted they've done that.
[01:58:35.713 --> 01:58:39.576]  And the CDC's own documents admit brain damage, and they wouldn't give it to their own children.
[01:58:40.116 --> 01:58:44.700]  But they have news all over the country before school started this week going, it's the law.
[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:45.720]  You have to vaccinate.
[01:58:45.921 --> 01:58:47.081]  Can't go to school if you don't.
[01:58:47.602 --> 01:58:55.167]  Knowingly being conscious of the fact that the waivers were in the principal's desk and in the nurse's desk, that by law,
[01:58:57.003 --> 01:59:10.028]  Not just a law that you don't have to, but a law that they can't... The state of Texas had to pass a law because of our intense lobbying, last session, saying, stop grabbing people's children, stop arresting people, there is no law!
[01:59:11.348 --> 01:59:12.949]  You ask, how do they do it if there's no law?
[01:59:12.969 --> 01:59:16.310]  Well, they corner you, get you to sign a document, waiving your rights.
[01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:17.370]  It's like the Soviet Union.
[01:59:17.410 --> 01:59:17.911]  Sign here!
[01:59:18.111 --> 01:59:18.811]  Admit you're guilty!
[01:59:20.074 --> 01:59:26.636]  So, I mean, how dare the Austin American Statesman, how dare local Fox News and all the others run these lies?
[01:59:27.376 --> 01:59:35.558]  Isn't that incredible, Courtney Zitzke, author of Mercury the Winged Messenger, your son was brain damaged by this, your son Ian.
[01:59:36.658 --> 01:59:43.460]  I mean, I don't know about your part of the country, but do you see these news pieces about you've got to do it, it's the law when it's not the law.
[01:59:44.401 --> 01:59:51.626]  Well, we've seen some of it up here in Seattle, but I don't think it's as widespread here as it probably is down there.
[01:59:52.606 --> 02:00:00.931]  But there's definitely a big brother attitude where they say, look it, you have to vaccinate your children.
[02:00:01.332 --> 02:00:08.336]  Just the other day I received something from the state of Washington reminding me to make sure that my children's vaccines are completely up to date.
[02:00:08.877 --> 02:00:16.259]  They give you the schedule of vaccines, and they say, in order to be admitted to public schools, you must have these vaccinations done.
[02:00:16.499 --> 02:00:17.199]  That's not true!
[02:00:17.619 --> 02:00:18.619]  No, it's not true.
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:24.421]  In fact, there's all kinds of exemptions out there, and all people have to do is say, no.
[02:00:25.301 --> 02:00:26.481]  I don't agree with it.
[02:00:27.022 --> 02:00:36.344]  In fact, I even wrote a letter to one of the school boards, it was the state of our state here, asking them for more information with regards on thimerosal.
[02:00:37.071 --> 02:00:40.993]  I even called them, and I got no comment, never returned my calls.
[02:00:43.274 --> 02:00:44.294]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:00:44.414 --> 02:00:45.214]  It's very interesting.
[02:00:45.915 --> 02:00:51.197]  So again, that's government lying, implying you have to in the dumbbells out there.
[02:00:51.977 --> 02:00:56.319]  Perception is reality, so they're setting the precedent that you've got to do this when you don't.
[02:00:56.599 --> 02:00:58.080]  No, you do not have to do it.
[02:01:01.665 --> 02:01:10.069]  And let me tell you something, every principal and every nurse knows this, but they've been told, we don't get our money if 99% don't do this.
[02:01:10.489 --> 02:01:11.049]  That is correct.
[02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:12.170]  That is correct.
[02:01:12.690 --> 02:01:17.672]  The pharmaceutical industry with vaccinations is absolutely huge business.
[02:01:18.012 --> 02:01:18.452]  Big money.
[02:01:19.153 --> 02:01:29.217]  And when you've got government going to bat for you and saying, we're going to mandate 21 vaccines and soon to be 35 and 46, that's going to do very good for your bottom line.
[02:01:30.805 --> 02:01:31.846]  Well, look at the damage from 21.
[02:01:32.026 --> 02:01:32.606]  Oh, yeah.
[02:01:34.307 --> 02:01:35.788]  And what, just five years ago it was like 18.
[02:01:35.828 --> 02:01:38.590]  Now, I mean, when they get... I mean, folks!
[02:01:39.451 --> 02:01:42.533]  I mean, let's say one of the companies screwed up and did something wrong.
[02:01:42.573 --> 02:01:53.159]  And I mean, every time we look at a company that got all these problems and mold and fungus and weird viruses and they grow these in baby parts and all kinds of genetic diseases.
[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:55.881]  I mean, it just... It's in... 40 plus shots?
[02:01:55.901 --> 02:01:56.362]  21 shots?
[02:01:56.382 --> 02:01:56.642]  I mean...
[02:02:00.094 --> 02:02:00.754]  It's amazing.
[02:02:00.854 --> 02:02:01.534]  Where does it end?
[02:02:03.715 --> 02:02:09.056]  Well, under Homeland Security, on page 71, they do have the National Force Vaccination Program.
[02:02:09.076 --> 02:02:10.056]  They're claiming that power.
[02:02:10.996 --> 02:02:11.456]  But we'll see.
[02:02:11.536 --> 02:02:19.217]  You know, they tried to make all the firemen and police take the shots, and the LA Times reported last year that 99 plus percent refused.
[02:02:19.257 --> 02:02:19.837]  Said, fire me.
[02:02:21.118 --> 02:02:23.498]  Wonder what the cops and firemen know that we don't know.
[02:02:23.798 --> 02:02:24.218]  Exactly.
[02:02:24.238 --> 02:02:28.779]  So they can sell us all day that we're kooks, but their own enforcers said no.
[02:02:30.094 --> 02:02:31.375]  And I say more power to him!
[02:02:32.295 --> 02:02:34.556]  We're going to come back, sir, and get through calls.

[02:05:45.043 --> 02:05:50.107]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.468 --> 02:05:52.790]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.852 --> 02:05:59.876]  Let me just say something here before we go back to your calls.
[02:06:02.037 --> 02:06:13.187]  I am so thankful and blessed and amazed at how many great am and as an affiliates we have around the country from Rhode Island to Los Angeles
[02:06:13.996 --> 02:06:33.213]  To Austin, Texas, to Kansas City, to Pensacola, Florida, to Rochester, New York, to New Mexico, to Youngstown, just all over the country, but it's a handful compared to some of the big neocon broadcasters.
[02:06:34.557 --> 02:06:39.241]  It means nothing to me to have somebody come up on the street and shake my hand and say, oh you're so great and oh Alex we love you.
[02:06:39.781 --> 02:06:45.306]  I'm not in this so I'm some big authority and powerful broadcaster.
[02:06:45.446 --> 02:06:46.547]  It means nothing to me.
[02:06:46.627 --> 02:06:47.628]  I like to go fishing.
[02:06:47.648 --> 02:06:48.569]  I like to go hiking.
[02:06:49.049 --> 02:06:49.890]  I like to travel.
[02:06:50.710 --> 02:06:52.271]  I like to hang out with my family.
[02:06:52.291 --> 02:06:59.334]  I don't like fighting the New World Order all the time and running around fighting the city and the county and the state and the feds and sitting up till 2 a.m.
[02:06:59.374 --> 02:07:03.055]  making documentary films and, you know, consulting.
[02:07:04.035 --> 02:07:08.857]  I do this because I'm angry and upset by the threat to humanity, a threat that threatens me and my family.
[02:07:10.538 --> 02:07:12.499]  And that's why I'm envious.
[02:07:13.599 --> 02:07:20.222]  I'm angry at how some mindless show that just puts out lies and propaganda can be on 500 radio stations.
[02:07:20.979 --> 02:07:22.980]  You know, we need to be on more radio stations.
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:34.925]  And if you're listening on shortwave, or the internet, or satellite, and you don't have a local AM or FM in your area, you need to call that local mom or pop station, you can forget the big conglomerates, and tell them to pick up the broadcast.
[02:07:34.965 --> 02:07:40.287]  To go to GCNlive.com and look at all the satellites we have to offer and the feeds we've got to pick up this show.
[02:07:40.307 --> 02:07:49.091]  Because we back up everything we talk about, neurotically, it's all posted on the website every day, whatever I talk about, all mainstream, all legislation, all right there, all...
[02:07:50.043 --> 02:07:51.464]  I'm sorry it's all true, too.
[02:07:51.504 --> 02:07:53.225]  Believe me, I wish this wasn't true!
[02:07:55.185 --> 02:07:56.366]  But I want more stations.
[02:07:56.506 --> 02:07:57.466]  I want to reach more people.
[02:07:57.506 --> 02:07:58.367]  That's my thrill.
[02:07:59.267 --> 02:08:02.989]  Every person we save or warn or wake up is like diamonds in my hand.
[02:08:03.269 --> 02:08:04.230]  I lust after it.
[02:08:04.290 --> 02:08:04.930]  I crave it.
[02:08:04.990 --> 02:08:05.570]  I want it.
[02:08:06.090 --> 02:08:07.371]  It's what I'm all about.
[02:08:08.091 --> 02:08:09.172]  I want to expose evil.
[02:08:09.252 --> 02:08:10.212]  I want to fight bullies.
[02:08:10.292 --> 02:08:11.933]  I don't want to see more children brain damaged.
[02:08:12.353 --> 02:08:13.574]  It drives me up the wall.
[02:08:13.934 --> 02:08:15.235]  And I'm not a special person.
[02:08:15.295 --> 02:08:16.175]  Please don't thank me.
[02:08:16.355 --> 02:08:18.036]  This is a normal response.
[02:08:18.985 --> 02:08:29.852]  I think of all those parents who are about to vaccinate their child today, who's going to be brain damaged, who I was unable to reach, who today are going to be listening to Sean Hannity lie to us about how wonderful the government is.
[02:08:31.473 --> 02:08:33.614]  Or hear John Kerry outlying to us.
[02:08:35.915 --> 02:08:38.617]  This is evil, this is documented, this is out in the open.
[02:08:40.623 --> 02:08:42.724]  And don't laugh at me, police and bureaucrats.
[02:08:42.744 --> 02:08:45.525]  It's going to be your child you go inject that's going to be brain damaged.
[02:08:45.965 --> 02:08:47.306]  And you're the one that's going to cry.
[02:08:47.566 --> 02:08:53.368]  And I don't want you to walk up to me and cry in the parking lot of the grocery store like a cop did two weeks ago.
[02:08:53.408 --> 02:08:54.509]  My son's brain damaged.
[02:08:54.529 --> 02:08:55.069]  You were right.
[02:08:55.129 --> 02:08:56.810]  I laughed at you.
[02:08:56.930 --> 02:08:58.410]  Some big six foot four guy.
[02:08:58.751 --> 02:08:59.391]  I don't want it.
[02:08:59.471 --> 02:09:00.952]  I can't handle it anymore.
[02:09:02.812 --> 02:09:03.993]  He was 18 months old.
[02:09:04.013 --> 02:09:06.474]  We got the triple shot and now he just sits in the corner.
[02:09:07.074 --> 02:09:07.674]  You were right.
[02:09:09.602 --> 02:09:10.882]  Don't go that far.
[02:09:12.123 --> 02:09:12.983]  I can't handle it.
[02:09:13.223 --> 02:09:14.604]  I don't mean to go off on this rant.
[02:09:14.644 --> 02:09:16.084]  This just really upsets me.
[02:09:18.185 --> 02:09:21.806]  Going back to our guest, whose son was brain damaged by this, Courtney Zitzke.
[02:09:22.186 --> 02:09:24.527]  Courtney, I mean, do you get where I'm coming from?
[02:09:24.547 --> 02:09:26.448]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:09:26.648 --> 02:09:27.368]  It's a tragedy.
[02:09:27.588 --> 02:09:33.610]  You know, I mean, this autism mercury poisoning tragedy affects people from all walks of lives.
[02:09:34.371 --> 02:09:35.551]  It doesn't have any gender
[02:09:36.647 --> 02:09:40.829]  Specifics, it's not racial specific, it's everybody specific.
[02:09:41.529 --> 02:09:58.816]  I was up at a very good restaurant the other day with my wife and my other child, and I saw a child who was of Mexican descent, and his parents were sitting having dinner, and I noticed the child was exhibiting the same neurological problems that my son has.
[02:09:59.756 --> 02:10:01.477]  I went up to him, introduced myself.
[02:10:01.737 --> 02:10:02.417]  Hi, I'm Courtney.
[02:10:03.277 --> 02:10:04.717]  May I ask you a question?
[02:10:04.797 --> 02:10:05.638]  And he said, yes.
[02:10:05.738 --> 02:10:07.818]  He says, is your child autistic?
[02:10:07.898 --> 02:10:09.299]  And he said, yes, he is.
[02:10:10.199 --> 02:10:12.339]  And I had him tell me about it.
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:17.581]  And he said, I asked him the question, was he okay before the shots?
[02:10:18.757 --> 02:10:21.137]  He said he was a perfect child before the shots.
[02:10:21.217 --> 02:10:26.038]  Just like every single child that has this problem was perfect before the shot.
[02:10:26.118 --> 02:10:35.180]  And these bastards, these scums, straight out of the pits of deepest night circle hell want to force us to give our children this.
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:37.040]  I will never put up with it.
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:38.961]  I will never go along with you.
[02:10:39.261 --> 02:10:43.722]  And it's so many useful idiots denying the facts, going along with this in the system.
[02:10:44.002 --> 02:10:44.642]  Shame on you.
[02:10:44.662 --> 02:10:46.062]  You're going to hell, people.
[02:10:47.623 --> 02:10:56.088]  And to sit there and to... So you looked over and the child was nodding and looking at his fingers and in that... Oh yeah, he was exhibiting the classic symptoms.
[02:10:56.128 --> 02:11:01.532]  So I asked him, I said, well you know, have you been tested for mercury poisoning from the baby vaccines?
[02:11:02.233 --> 02:11:06.275]  The boy's mother immediately started to cry and she says, I had a suspicion.
[02:11:06.295 --> 02:11:08.597]  Did you tell him how to detox?
[02:11:08.637 --> 02:11:14.641]  Yeah, I told him about the chelation, told him about the physician that I'm seeing in Seattle who is an excellent physician.
[02:11:15.624 --> 02:11:24.149]  Um, and they have already started the chelation therapy, and the guy called me up, almost crying the other day, saying, you are absolutely correct.
[02:11:24.409 --> 02:11:31.192]  We've tested him for mercury, the results were off the chart, we're chelating him, and he's already starting to calm down.
[02:11:32.093 --> 02:11:33.053]  Oh, thank God.
[02:11:33.073 --> 02:11:34.874]  Those bastards did that.
[02:11:35.314 --> 02:11:41.958]  What I wrote the book for, Mr. Jones, was basically to get the word out that people need to be informed.
[02:11:42.338 --> 02:11:43.859]  This is not a political
[02:11:44.329 --> 02:11:48.511]  It's not an issue of war, it's an issue of their children.
[02:11:49.031 --> 02:11:53.993]  The most precious thing they have in their lives are people's children.
[02:11:54.754 --> 02:12:02.357]  And when a child goes into mercury poisoning as a result of this, it is an absolute national and international tragedy.
[02:12:02.978 --> 02:12:05.299]  That's why I wrote the book, Mercury the Winged Messenger.
[02:12:05.319 --> 02:12:07.581]  And when they act like you're a kook, folks... Absolutely has to happen.
[02:12:08.001 --> 02:12:08.922]  Well, God bless you for it.
[02:12:08.942 --> 02:12:12.684]  When they act like you're a kook, when you say no, how come Europe doesn't allow it till five?
[02:12:12.724 --> 02:12:13.905]  How come Japan till two?
[02:12:14.325 --> 02:12:18.367]  Well, people are starting to realize that there is a serious problem.
[02:12:19.028 --> 02:12:23.470]  And people, you know, five years ago, people were saying, oh forget it, you can't prove anything.
[02:12:23.851 --> 02:12:27.473]  When in fact, everything has been proven.
[02:12:27.513 --> 02:12:28.173]  Let's go to calls.
[02:12:28.193 --> 02:12:28.994]  We gotta go to calls.
[02:12:30.354 --> 02:12:32.175]  I don't know what I'd do if they did this to my children.
[02:12:32.656 --> 02:12:33.456]  I mean, how do you deal?
[02:12:33.536 --> 02:12:35.077]  I guess you deal with it by fighting back?
[02:12:35.237 --> 02:12:35.978]  It's heartbreaking.
[02:12:36.798 --> 02:12:37.979]  It's absolutely heartbreaking.
[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:42.141]  In a way, they try to take your children's soul, folks.
[02:12:42.962 --> 02:12:43.822]  What does the Bible say?
[02:12:43.843 --> 02:12:46.844]  In the end times, the beast traffics in men's souls.
[02:12:47.925 --> 02:12:49.946]  Let's take calls here.
[02:12:50.086 --> 02:12:52.728]  Jeff in Colorado, then Steve, Brian, Mike, and Jim.
[02:12:52.768 --> 02:12:53.488]  I'll try to get to everybody.
[02:12:54.049 --> 02:12:54.729]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:12:55.150 --> 02:12:55.610]  Hey, Alex.
[02:12:55.730 --> 02:12:56.170]  How's it going?
[02:12:56.330 --> 02:12:56.590]  Good.
[02:12:57.011 --> 02:12:57.971]  Hey, good to talk to you guys.
[02:12:58.031 --> 02:12:59.072]  Courtney, how you doing?
[02:12:59.713 --> 02:13:00.273]  Good.
[02:13:01.534 --> 02:13:09.177]  Alex, first of all, just real quick, either which way, if I was to meet you in person, I would still shake your hand because I appreciate all you're doing.
[02:13:10.118 --> 02:13:10.818]  Enough said with that.
[02:13:11.178 --> 02:13:13.099]  Courtney, I can empathize with you.
[02:13:13.239 --> 02:13:22.503]  I have a 10-year-old stepdaughter who was perfectly normal and after her MMR shot, went blind for almost a year and was almost killed.
[02:13:23.204 --> 02:13:28.426]  And nowadays, she's at least a year and a half behind kids her age.
[02:13:29.526 --> 02:13:30.387]  Very frustrating.
[02:13:30.407 --> 02:13:35.449]  We're still trying to teach her how to use a knife to cut her food and so forth.
[02:13:35.509 --> 02:13:48.054]  Besides that, you know, her behavior is a little bit different than other kids, but she seems to be getting better and better and I'm certainly not going to lose hope and a lot of people are praying for her as we are.
[02:13:48.094 --> 02:13:48.815]  Have you detoxed her?
[02:13:48.835 --> 02:13:51.996]  Because the mercury sits in the frontal lobe forever, burning through brain cells.
[02:13:52.556 --> 02:13:54.857]  Yeah, you know, and I'm curious about the chelation.
[02:13:55.638 --> 02:13:57.379]  Well, there's a lot of quack stuff out there.
[02:13:57.439 --> 02:13:58.139]  Go to a doctor.
[02:13:58.948 --> 02:14:04.130]  Yeah, Terry Grossman's here in Lakewood, any which way.
[02:14:04.150 --> 02:14:06.230]  I'm thinking about that myself.
[02:14:06.250 --> 02:14:10.192]  If I can get some mercury fillings removed, I want to try to maybe do that, any which way.
[02:14:10.972 --> 02:14:16.013]  I just had a quick question about the, I believe it's a hepatitis shot.
[02:14:16.353 --> 02:14:24.856]  I have a seven-month-old daughter we just had and praise God I was turned on to your show before that and I decided against the vaccinations.
[02:14:25.336 --> 02:14:27.317]  Unfortunately, I did opt on that.
[02:14:27.853 --> 02:14:33.378]  Well, I mean, Hepatitis is sexually transmitted or IV drug use, and there's no reason to give it to a baby.
[02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:56.191]  I agree completely.
[02:14:56.211 --> 02:15:11.945]  Only medical workers should... I agree completely, Alex, and now I know better, and as a matter of fact, my friend had a B-Boy yesterday, and I basically begged him, please, you know, when they offer to get you that hepatitis shot, just say no.
[02:15:12.005 --> 02:15:16.109]  Just say no and research it later, and if you feel you need to do that, fine, but please don't.
[02:15:16.309 --> 02:15:16.970]  What did he do?
[02:15:17.690 --> 02:15:20.373]  As far as I know, he hasn't, but I have to get a hold of the data.
[02:15:20.473 --> 02:15:21.694]  Okay, what's your question?
[02:15:22.378 --> 02:15:22.778]  That was it.
[02:15:22.838 --> 02:15:27.401]  I just wanted to know what you know about that first hepatitis shot, what the thimerosal levels are and that.
[02:15:28.521 --> 02:15:31.103]  Well, I mean, it's also just toxic to give them that virus.
[02:15:31.123 --> 02:15:32.023]  Thanks for the call.
[02:15:32.764 --> 02:15:34.385]  Let's talk to Steve in Florida.
[02:15:34.425 --> 02:15:35.185]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:15:36.446 --> 02:15:36.826]  Hi, Alex.
[02:15:36.906 --> 02:15:37.827]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:15:37.947 --> 02:15:38.307]  You bet.
[02:15:38.967 --> 02:15:41.008]  I have a first question and then another one.
[02:15:41.269 --> 02:15:43.810]  Are you going to rebroadcast this interview tonight?
[02:15:43.850 --> 02:15:44.871]  I'd like a friend to hear it.
[02:15:45.071 --> 02:15:45.331]  Yes.
[02:15:46.752 --> 02:15:47.312]  Okay, thank you.
[02:15:48.130 --> 02:15:54.394]  And this sounds like a book I read a long time ago, What Every Parent Should Know About Childhood Immunizations by Jamie Murphy.
[02:15:54.935 --> 02:15:57.336]  And you cannot find it in books a million or anywhere.
[02:15:57.376 --> 02:15:58.837]  They've removed it and sanitized it.
[02:15:59.237 --> 02:15:59.818]  But I got a 1-800 number.
[02:15:59.858 --> 02:16:02.319]  I don't know if it would be appropriate for me to give that.
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:04.201]  Sure, give it out.
[02:16:04.221 --> 02:16:04.461]  1-800-431-1579.
[02:16:04.481 --> 02:16:04.661]  That's 431-1579.
[02:16:11.109 --> 02:16:14.130]  What every parent should know about childhood immunization?
[02:16:14.150 --> 02:16:18.212]  Well, folks can go to PrisonPlanet.com and read hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[02:16:18.472 --> 02:16:20.332]  The CDC's own documents!
[02:16:20.553 --> 02:16:23.294]  That's a fact, and I've been passing out your information for many years.
[02:16:23.354 --> 02:16:27.655]  And the sad fact is, it says in Hosea, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:16:27.715 --> 02:16:35.278]  And many of the people that I pass your information to, and a lot of stuff that I've tried to pass out about the lives of the CDC for many years,
[02:16:36.041 --> 02:16:40.564]  People will just look at you, and their eyes will glaze, and they give you a silly smile, and they do not believe you.
[02:16:40.584 --> 02:16:48.128]  But I thank God, and we pray for you daily, Alex, and I thank God that you've had Courtney Zitzke on today talking about this issue.
[02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:53.591]  Well, thank you, but you know, they're not glazing over and giggling anymore.
[02:16:53.631 --> 02:16:56.933]  I'd say most people I've talked to now have heard this is bad and are concerned.
[02:16:57.293 --> 02:16:57.754]  Many more.
[02:16:57.794 --> 02:17:04.678]  As a matter of fact, just about a month ago on NBC, and I don't watch NBC much, but I was watching it, and they talked about this.
[02:17:04.718 --> 02:17:05.278]  They had a long
[02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:14.536]  Well, they didn't go that far, but they did give a warning.
[02:17:14.576 --> 02:17:17.378]  They showed the parents with the autistic child and looked very pitiful.
[02:17:17.678 --> 02:17:19.120]  And there it was on mainstream news.
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:20.641]  God bless you.
[02:17:20.661 --> 02:17:21.041]  Yeah.
[02:17:24.801 --> 02:17:25.462]  When do you have to go?
[02:17:25.482 --> 02:17:26.623]  In about ten minutes.
[02:17:26.743 --> 02:17:28.004]  Alright, we'll just do one more segment.
[02:17:28.384 --> 02:17:29.465]  Go to Brian and Mike and Jim.
[02:17:29.485 --> 02:17:31.627]  That'll be it for our guests and I'm going to get into a bunch of other news.
[02:17:32.147 --> 02:17:41.035]  But frankly, there's nothing more important than the systematic premeditated poisoning and brain damaging of our population by design right out of Brave New World.
[02:17:41.055 --> 02:17:42.896]  This is being done by design.
[02:17:42.976 --> 02:17:43.457]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.333 --> 02:17:48.815]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[02:17:49.075 --> 02:17:52.576]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:17:52.656 --> 02:17:56.618]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:17:56.838 --> 02:18:03.001]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:03.401 --> 02:18:11.305]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:18:11.665 --> 02:18:12.086]  I think so.
[02:18:27.098 --> 02:18:30.281]  You get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:18:30.361 --> 02:18:36.947]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:18:37.007 --> 02:18:38.708]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:18:44.591 --> 02:18:45.572]  It's finally here.
[02:18:45.712 --> 02:18:46.713]  Spring has arrived.
[02:18:46.893 --> 02:18:49.855]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:18:50.075 --> 02:18:53.517]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:18:53.738 --> 02:19:01.903]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:19:02.163 --> 02:19:02.944]  With Ark's heirloom
[02:19:03.204 --> 02:19:05.886]  You can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:19:06.086 --> 02:19:11.129]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:19:11.409 --> 02:19:15.891]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:19:16.092 --> 02:19:20.154]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:19:20.254 --> 02:19:27.438]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce, and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:19:27.678 --> 02:19:28.979]  Save money, eat healthy.
[02:19:29.199 --> 02:19:33.142]  Grow your own delicious, secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[02:19:33.322 --> 02:19:37.065]  Call the Ark Institute toll-free at 800-255-1912.
[02:19:37.125 --> 02:19:42.769]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[02:19:45.510 --> 02:19:47.272]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[02:19:47.792 --> 02:19:51.214]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:19:51.715 --> 02:19:52.395]  Let's update.
[02:19:52.896 --> 02:19:56.338]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:19:58.248 --> 02:20:00.709]  The Nasdaq, in that same time frame, is flat.
[02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:02.330]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:20:02.370 --> 02:20:04.691]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[02:20:05.211 --> 02:20:06.111]  Today, the U.S.
[02:20:06.131 --> 02:20:08.352]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[02:20:08.772 --> 02:20:10.293]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:20:10.873 --> 02:20:12.854]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[02:20:14.195 --> 02:20:19.077]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:20:20.057 --> 02:20:20.797]  Gold is moving.
[02:20:21.057 --> 02:20:22.218]  Equities are treading water.
[02:20:22.618 --> 02:20:25.159]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:20:25.805 --> 02:20:27.187]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:20:27.627 --> 02:20:29.330]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:31.733]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:20:32.133 --> 02:20:34.236]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:20:36.419 --> 02:20:38.582]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[02:20:38.942 --> 02:20:39.243]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:43.786 --> 02:20:45.288]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:20:45.468 --> 02:20:46.610]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:20:46.770 --> 02:20:50.195]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:50.295 --> 02:20:50.735]  Phenol!
[02:20:51.056 --> 02:20:58.125]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:20:58.666 --> 02:21:02.549]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:21:02.669 --> 02:21:03.110]  Fragrance?
[02:21:03.490 --> 02:21:08.254]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:21:08.394 --> 02:21:13.078]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[02:21:13.299 --> 02:21:15.721]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[02:21:16.121 --> 02:21:19.522]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:21:19.662 --> 02:21:23.204]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:21:23.424 --> 02:21:25.785]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:21:25.945 --> 02:21:26.825]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:21:26.945 --> 02:21:36.689]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Kalben Pure Soaps.
[02:21:36.869 --> 02:21:39.089]  Call Kalben toll free 1-800-340-7091 or visit KalbenPureSoap.com.
[02:21:50.131 --> 02:21:52.072]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:52.532 --> 02:21:55.452]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:00.894 --> 02:22:03.154]  I'm going to go to Mike in Arizona first.
[02:22:03.174 --> 02:22:06.755]  I'm going to move quickly because I want to get to Mike, Jim, and Gail, and Dan.
[02:22:07.395 --> 02:22:09.736]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:22:09.756 --> 02:22:10.436]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:22:11.076 --> 02:22:11.476]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:11.496 --> 02:22:12.917]  Just a quick note.
[02:22:13.857 --> 02:22:17.478]  Children do catch hepatitis B and D.
[02:22:18.668 --> 02:22:22.931]  Through their mothers, it's a vertical transmission, so there is some rationale.
[02:22:22.951 --> 02:22:27.395]  Yeah, but they test the mothers for diseases beforehand.
[02:22:28.175 --> 02:22:29.516]  Well, yeah, I don't know.
[02:22:29.596 --> 02:22:40.224]  In East Asia, where this is a major problem, where Hepatitis B is epidemic, I don't know how much testing they have, but there is a reason for it.
[02:22:40.284 --> 02:22:44.487]  I mean, the baby can catch it through mother's milk.
[02:22:44.828 --> 02:22:46.048]  You're a doctor, aren't you?
[02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.649]  Yeah.
[02:22:48.061 --> 02:22:49.902]  So what do you think about all this vaccine business?
[02:22:50.823 --> 02:22:52.424]  Well, you guys are ahead of me on this one.
[02:22:52.604 --> 02:23:00.289]  I wasn't aware of this mercury controversy, and I don't know what the alternatives are to, as far as preservatives.
[02:23:00.609 --> 02:23:01.090]  Take them out!
[02:23:02.130 --> 02:23:03.912]  Well, and they do have alternatives, sir.
[02:23:04.492 --> 02:23:10.956]  Yeah, I imagine they do, but... You must have missed the broadcast when I probably had 20, 25 medical doctors on about this.
[02:23:11.436 --> 02:23:12.217]  Yeah, I guess I did.
[02:23:13.758 --> 02:23:16.640]  You know, the alternative, though, if you go without preservatives,
[02:23:17.530 --> 02:23:24.413]  And you transmit infectious diseases through the vaccination because of contamination.
[02:23:25.794 --> 02:23:33.057]  That's just as bad, if not worse, than... Well, that's why you need to have a single-dose vaccine, not a multiple-dose vaccine.
[02:23:35.158 --> 02:23:39.880]  The multiple-dose vaccines have the thimerosol in them, and they were totally unnecessary.
[02:23:39.980 --> 02:23:41.521]  This national tragedy
[02:23:42.139 --> 02:23:43.740]  Could have and should have been avoided.
[02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:54.165]  Yeah, but knowing the mindset of the globalists and the people who run the big corporations, you know, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they were just totally indifferent.
[02:23:55.266 --> 02:24:00.148]  Well, look, look, doctor, doctor, I'm not saying vaccines couldn't be a good thing.
[02:24:00.248 --> 02:24:01.969]  I'm saying the globalists can't be trusted.
[02:24:02.250 --> 02:24:08.253]  I've got mainstream news where they've been caught putting sterilization hormones in with tetanus shots in third world countries.
[02:24:08.493 --> 02:24:10.634]  Yeah, well, you and I are of one mind on this, Alex.
[02:24:11.428 --> 02:24:12.308]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:24:12.368 --> 02:24:12.709]  Thank you.
[02:24:13.209 --> 02:24:14.749]  Brian in Portland, Oregon.
[02:24:14.769 --> 02:24:16.030]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:24:16.050 --> 02:24:16.670]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:24:18.451 --> 02:24:27.655]  Yes, I was just wondering if your guest agrees with you that this is by design, or if he thinks it's just money-making scheme.
[02:24:28.615 --> 02:24:30.636]  Well, I think there's a little bit of both.
[02:24:31.456 --> 02:24:38.699]  I think it is most definitely by design, simply because if it wasn't, they wouldn't have done it in the first place.
[02:24:40.418 --> 02:24:46.043]  They knew from 1930 that mercury could cause this type of problem.
[02:24:46.103 --> 02:24:46.803]  They kept it in.
[02:24:46.844 --> 02:24:48.565]  And here's an interesting point.
[02:24:49.466 --> 02:24:55.631]  The pet vaccination industry took primarily a lot of vaccines for animals 12 to 13 years ago.
[02:24:57.092 --> 02:24:58.594]  But it's more driven by money.
[02:24:59.893 --> 02:25:00.934]  I think that anything else.
[02:25:01.394 --> 02:25:02.575]  It's all shareholder value.
[02:25:03.116 --> 02:25:07.860]  Myself, I think it's driven by the want to control us more than money.
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:12.503]  I think money is, I agree more with Alex, is just kind of a, they don't really have enough money.
[02:25:12.563 --> 02:25:18.808]  They need to control and they want to throw us down and they don't want a healthy, intelligent populace.
[02:25:19.389 --> 02:25:20.230]  I agree with you, Brian.
[02:25:20.270 --> 02:25:20.570]  Thanks.
[02:25:20.610 --> 02:25:22.571]  We'll talk to a caller in Michigan now.
[02:25:23.032 --> 02:25:23.933]  Jim in Michigan.
[02:25:23.973 --> 02:25:25.214]  Jim, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:25:25.234 --> 02:25:25.614]  Go ahead.
[02:25:26.795 --> 02:25:27.356]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:25:27.376 --> 02:25:27.896]  How are you doing?
[02:25:28.016 --> 02:25:28.397]  Good, sir.
[02:25:28.637 --> 02:25:29.718]  Two quick things if I could.
[02:25:29.758 --> 02:25:34.222]  I was just at a fundraiser a while ago with Dr. Mark Geyer and his son David.
[02:25:34.442 --> 02:25:34.783]  Oh yeah.
[02:25:35.543 --> 02:25:44.011]  And when I talked to Dr. Geyer, he had mentioned to me that he's been testing vaccines all around the country that supposedly were thimerosil free.
[02:25:45.730 --> 02:25:47.671]  Because it wasn't labeled with the Marisol.
[02:25:48.211 --> 02:25:54.153]  But everyone he tested that was supposed to be free of the Marisol, it indeed contained the same amount of the Marisol.
[02:25:54.213 --> 02:25:55.973]  Yeah, we interviewed him about six months ago.
[02:25:56.033 --> 02:26:02.595]  He's the guy that got into the CDC and got these documents out, because Dan Burton, the congressman, forced him in, allowed him in.
[02:26:03.195 --> 02:26:11.518]  Well, at that fundraiser I was at, there's a lady, April, and her last name, forgive me, but she's the Autism Autoimmunity Project out of Florida.
[02:26:12.487 --> 02:26:15.129]  And at that time, her daughter had just died.
[02:26:16.050 --> 02:26:20.433]  Her daughter was 13, was autistic after her vaccination when she was a child.
[02:26:21.154 --> 02:26:29.140]  And I just found out from my sister that actually she didn't die from the effects of the thimerosal, but there was something else in the vaccine.
[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:32.923]  And I forget what it is, but I talked to my sister.
[02:26:32.963 --> 02:26:34.164]  I'll get that information to you.
[02:26:34.704 --> 02:26:39.608]  But that's actually, there was something else in the vaccine that actually ended up causing the death of her child.
[02:26:40.678 --> 02:26:43.339]  I'll get that information if I can for you, Alex.
[02:26:43.359 --> 02:26:45.919]  Dr. Geyer, by the way, worked for the federal government.
[02:26:46.599 --> 02:26:50.400]  Yes, and like you said, the head honcho for Dan Burton's committee.
[02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:55.881]  And when he went to get the records, was it the FDA or the CDC?
[02:26:56.201 --> 02:27:03.362]  They were all encrypted, and he went through a big hassle with them, just trying to find somebody who could read the encryption.
[02:27:03.382 --> 02:27:05.903]  And when he de-encrypted it, they said, we know it's hurting him!
[02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.451]  Absolutely.
[02:27:08.471 --> 02:27:08.911]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:27:09.311 --> 02:27:10.132]  All right, thank you.
[02:27:10.372 --> 02:27:11.613]  This is a fact, folks.
[02:27:13.215 --> 02:27:15.997]  Courtney Zitzke, I want to thank you for coming on the broadcast.
[02:27:16.017 --> 02:27:17.238]  Thank you very much for having me.
[02:27:17.879 --> 02:27:23.144]  Mercury, the wing messenger, and thanks for coming on, and thank you for standing up and fighting, and sorry about your son.
[02:27:23.464 --> 02:27:31.051]  Well, thank you very much for having me, and like I said, I wrote the book to inform people, and I think it's a must-read for everybody who's concerned about it.
[02:27:31.071 --> 02:27:31.371]  Good, good.
[02:27:31.391 --> 02:27:32.272]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:27:32.292 --> 02:27:33.333]  We'll be back with news and calls.
[02:27:35.623 --> 02:27:38.606]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.626 --> 02:27:42.350]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.814 --> 02:27:50.499]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:27:50.999 --> 02:27:54.123]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[02:27:54.798 --> 02:28:00.722]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[02:28:01.242 --> 02:28:04.844]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:28:05.305 --> 02:28:07.946]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[02:28:08.407 --> 02:28:12.189]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[02:28:12.649 --> 02:28:16.592]  All you need to know is the name of the program you would like a copy of and the month that it aired.
[02:28:17.133 --> 02:28:20.455]  Don't be left out of current news and information that affects our lives every day.
[02:28:20.796 --> 02:28:26.320]  We all want to stay informed, so visit our website at GCNLive.com and click on the GCN Mall.

[02:28:31.663 --> 02:28:32.704]  It's easy and convenient.

[02:28:45.484 --> 02:28:48.505]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:48.805 --> 02:28:53.746]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:53.986 --> 02:28:58.347]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.647 --> 02:29:03.528]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[02:29:03.708 --> 02:29:07.549]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.769 --> 02:29:11.390]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:16.714]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:16.994 --> 02:29:23.739]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.219 --> 02:29:24.760]  What about you?
[02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:30.412]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.
[02:29:30.452 --> 02:29:30.872]  A $14 savings.

[02:29:45.118 --> 02:29:49.921]  If you're losing your hair and haven't tried Avacor yet, how about a free month's supply?
[02:29:50.161 --> 02:29:54.463]  That's right, we're giving away a free month of Avacor with all of today's orders.
[02:29:54.764 --> 02:29:57.765]  You've heard all about Avacor on radio and TV for years.
[02:29:58.025 --> 02:30:02.708]  That's because Avacor is proven to successfully stop hair loss and regrow hair.
[02:30:03.128 --> 02:30:08.091]  Avacor has helped people just like you regain their youthful appearance with new healthy

[02:30:10.352 --> 02:30:12.174]  We want you to try Avacor.
[02:30:12.454 --> 02:30:16.977]  We know that once your hair stops falling out and starts to regrow, you'll be glad you did.
[02:30:17.297 --> 02:30:18.178]  Still not convinced?
[02:30:18.458 --> 02:30:21.500]  Avacor comes with up to a full one-year money-back guarantee.
[02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:23.081]  Try getting that anywhere else.

[02:30:29.285 --> 02:30:29.465]  That's 800-533-7298.
[02:30:29.505 --> 02:30:33.526]  And remember, all of today's orders will receive an additional month's supply of Abicor absolutely free.
[02:30:33.546 --> 02:30:33.686]  Call 800-533-7298.
[02:30:58.187 --> 02:31:09.097]  Alright, I'm going to take five more calls and I'm going to cover some other top stories and recap some top news here in the last 26 minutes that we've got left on this live Wednesday edition.
[02:31:09.137 --> 02:31:18.105]  Just briefly, the vaccine situation is documented and the mercury is only one of the things we've proven.
[02:31:18.905 --> 02:31:21.728]  Cancer viruses, sterilization viruses,
[02:31:23.533 --> 02:31:28.536]  Sterilization, hormones, by design, official government plans, going back to the 50s and 60s.
[02:31:29.116 --> 02:31:31.538]  Caught red-handed doing it, this year again in Africa.
[02:31:32.398 --> 02:31:34.259]  If you take this stuff, you're asking for it.
[02:31:35.800 --> 02:31:40.543]  And you better ask yourself why the news is telling you you gotta take them, but it's not the law.
[02:31:43.045 --> 02:31:45.626]  Why you get letters in the mail saying you gotta do it when it's not the law.
[02:31:47.047 --> 02:31:47.747]  And 21 vaccines, 35, 46,
[02:31:51.713 --> 02:31:53.533]  They want to make you take these.
[02:31:53.573 --> 02:31:55.034]  Now they want to put them in the foods.
[02:31:55.854 --> 02:31:57.694]  And they're vaccines that change brain chemistry.
[02:31:57.734 --> 02:31:59.715]  How you feel so you can't become drug addicted.
[02:32:00.515 --> 02:32:03.636]  I mean, this is... It's so crazy, it's Twilight Zone.
[02:32:05.136 --> 02:32:09.197]  I hope you get my videos, folks, because they expose who's carrying out the terror attacks.
[02:32:10.837 --> 02:32:15.939]  Let me see, they brain damage millions of children consciously, but they wouldn't kill 3,000 people on 9-11 to get a police state.
[02:32:16.399 --> 02:32:17.579]  No, they wouldn't.
[02:32:18.300 --> 02:32:21.982]  They'd put a young military officer in a chamber and nerve gas them to death.
[02:32:23.003 --> 02:32:24.264]  But they wouldn't hurt you.
[02:32:24.344 --> 02:32:25.424]  They love you.
[02:32:25.484 --> 02:32:26.725]  They care about you.
[02:32:27.666 --> 02:32:28.686]  Just submit to them.
[02:32:29.187 --> 02:32:32.108]  How about you just wake up and expose these murdering creatures?
[02:32:32.949 --> 02:32:44.616]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to look at the ten videos I've made, the other videos I carry, the books I've written, the books I carry, the t-shirts, the bumper stickers, all the key information.
[02:32:44.676 --> 02:32:46.957]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com
[02:32:48.988 --> 02:32:53.630]  Or simply call toll free to get any of my 9-11 films, any of my police state films.
[02:32:53.991 --> 02:32:56.732]  You can ask questions about the films or what the different discounts are.
[02:32:56.752 --> 02:32:59.653]  1-888-253-3139 That's 888-253-3139 Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com
[02:33:14.671 --> 02:33:16.832]  Please, go watch the clips of the videos.
[02:33:16.932 --> 02:33:17.353]  Read about them.
[02:33:17.593 --> 02:33:18.453]  Order them today.
[02:33:18.573 --> 02:33:19.094]  Don't wait.
[02:33:19.214 --> 02:33:20.094]  Get my videos.
[02:33:20.154 --> 02:33:20.915]  Make copies of them.
[02:33:20.935 --> 02:33:22.856]  You can't make copies of George Humphrey's video.
[02:33:24.277 --> 02:33:26.178]  Actually, I've heard George authorize you to, so you can.
[02:33:26.518 --> 02:33:31.701]  His new film, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati is excellent.
[02:33:31.741 --> 02:33:34.763]  Eric Huffman's video, 9-11, Painful Deceptions.
[02:33:34.783 --> 02:33:36.885]  So I carry four great 9-11 videos.
[02:33:36.905 --> 02:33:38.305]  Two of them mine, two of them other people's.
[02:33:38.786 --> 02:33:40.747]  Big discounts on those if you get multiple ones.
[02:33:41.585 --> 02:33:41.706]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:41.726 --> 02:33:45.812]  Or again, write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:33:56.835 --> 02:33:58.536]  My films are all over two hours long.
[02:33:58.576 --> 02:33:59.596]  Some are almost three hours.
[02:33:59.976 --> 02:34:01.237]  So they're multiple films in one.
[02:34:01.257 --> 02:34:01.977]  That's why they're $25.95.
[02:34:03.097 --> 02:34:03.958]  Order three or more.
[02:34:03.998 --> 02:34:05.538]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[02:34:05.979 --> 02:34:10.860]  Then I've got deals where you get a George Humphrey video and you get the next one for $5 off in three color bucklets.
[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:13.021]  I've got a bunch of different deals like that.
[02:34:13.101 --> 02:34:16.402]  So 1-888-253-3139 or PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:34:21.370 --> 02:34:23.671]  Let's go to Gail in Texas.
[02:34:23.731 --> 02:34:24.711]  Gail, thanks for holding.
[02:34:24.751 --> 02:34:25.091]  Welcome.
[02:34:25.372 --> 02:34:26.092]  Hey, Alex.
[02:34:26.312 --> 02:34:29.473]  First of all, I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:34:29.553 --> 02:34:35.295]  You have truly been one of my heroes since probably 1998 when I've been hanging with you here in Austin.
[02:34:35.315 --> 02:34:41.137]  But I've got to let the folks know out there, my son has not had these injections for three years.
[02:34:41.157 --> 02:34:42.677]  I have sent him to school.
[02:34:42.737 --> 02:34:45.618]  He was, you know, a fifth, sixth, and seventh grader.
[02:34:45.739 --> 02:34:47.079]  And it's real simple, folks.
[02:34:47.897 --> 02:34:51.258]  Um, it's because the globalists cannot be trusted.
[02:34:51.318 --> 02:34:53.038]  It doesn't matter what their motives are.
[02:34:53.098 --> 02:34:54.019]  They've got many.
[02:34:54.659 --> 02:34:56.900]  And there's too many problems with these vaccines.
[02:34:57.220 --> 02:34:58.860]  It's a simple, it's a simple form.
[02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:00.080]  You fill it out.
[02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:04.442]  It says you've got some kind of a religious problem with these vaccines.
[02:35:04.822 --> 02:35:15.405]  And I also copied the law that states, the health services law that states that I don't have to tell them exactly what my religious organization or preference is.
[02:35:15.785 --> 02:35:17.025]  I just simply have to state
[02:35:17.694 --> 02:35:19.014]  I don't want to have this done.
[02:35:19.034 --> 02:35:20.575]  And you shouldn't have to do that to begin with.
[02:35:20.615 --> 02:35:30.297]  It's easy, and I had it notarized, and I sent it to the nurse, and I also copied her SO laws, and I copied some very interesting reading material I thought that she needed to be enlightened with.
[02:35:30.337 --> 02:35:30.817]  Yeah, it's good.
[02:35:30.857 --> 02:35:31.217]  Yeah, it's good.
[02:35:31.337 --> 02:35:34.137]  Hey, when you're pushing this, I want you to know how many children you've killed.
[02:35:34.237 --> 02:35:34.677]  Here, have it.
[02:35:34.957 --> 02:35:36.918]  Well, it's just a horrible thing.
[02:35:37.138 --> 02:35:38.378]  I mean... You're a murderer.
[02:35:38.418 --> 02:35:38.958]  How do you feel?
[02:35:39.038 --> 02:35:39.518]  Exactly!
[02:35:39.598 --> 02:35:45.300]  And I asked her three years ago, I said, am I really truly the only parent here that has done this?
[02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:47.320]  And she shook her head and said yes.
[02:35:48.144 --> 02:35:50.325]  And, you know, this is his last year in middle school.
[02:35:50.365 --> 02:35:52.126]  His name is Alex, too, by the way.
[02:35:52.146 --> 02:35:55.048]  And, you know, it's simple.
[02:35:55.748 --> 02:35:56.969]  The form still stands.
[02:35:57.009 --> 02:35:58.090]  There's a standing order.
[02:35:58.130 --> 02:36:00.331]  He's not getting the vaccine.
[02:36:00.371 --> 02:36:03.713]  Well, maybe that's three years ago, but the news said 20% haven't done it now.
[02:36:03.933 --> 02:36:05.053]  You know, but they don't say that.
[02:36:05.153 --> 02:36:08.355]  In Austin, at Corbel, there's a dozen places you can go here in town.
[02:36:08.395 --> 02:36:11.577]  You probably could go to the H-T-B and get free vaccines, for all I know.
[02:36:11.991 --> 02:36:14.172]  But they're advertising it to everybody.
[02:36:14.452 --> 02:36:16.852]  They're making it sound like it's absolute mandatory.
[02:36:16.892 --> 02:36:17.692]  Because it's so good!
[02:36:17.712 --> 02:36:19.453]  Because they care about us!
[02:36:19.473 --> 02:36:26.214]  I would not want to send their kid to school on the first day and have them ganked out of class because they didn't comply with these shots!
[02:36:26.814 --> 02:36:29.315]  It's simple, but I've got a real important number, Alex.
[02:36:29.375 --> 02:36:32.736]  It's through the National Vaccine Information Center.
[02:36:33.116 --> 02:36:37.617]  And this is an agency that's got a wealth of information about vaccines.
[02:36:37.637 --> 02:36:38.777]  They'll have all the forms.
[02:36:39.137 --> 02:36:41.618]  The parents don't want to get these vaccines for their kids.
[02:36:42.199 --> 02:36:42.999]  Get these forms.
[02:36:43.099 --> 02:36:44.100]  Just send it in.
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:45.400]  Yeah, give folks the phone number.
[02:36:45.420 --> 02:36:46.081]  Can I do that?
[02:36:46.481 --> 02:36:48.762]  Okay, great.
[02:36:49.702 --> 02:36:53.104]  It's the 703-938-0342.
[02:36:53.324 --> 02:36:55.525]  Folks, grab a pen and paper.
[02:36:55.605 --> 02:36:56.725]  Yeah, it's important.
[02:36:56.865 --> 02:37:00.127]  It's National Vaccine Information Center.
[02:37:00.227 --> 02:37:03.969]  And these guys are actually on our side of this thing.
[02:37:03.989 --> 02:37:04.889]  Give them the phone number again.
[02:37:04.929 --> 02:37:05.389]  Exactly.
[02:37:05.469 --> 02:37:05.789]  Thanks.
[02:37:05.949 --> 02:37:06.110]  It's 703-938-0342.
[02:37:10.340 --> 02:37:24.244]  0-3-4-2 and they do have a website it's www.NVIC and that would be for National Vaccine Information Center and it's all in caps but dot org.
[02:37:24.424 --> 02:37:25.684]  Okay thanks for the call Gail.
[02:37:25.824 --> 02:37:29.605]  All kinds of... Thanks for the call I appreciate it.
[02:37:29.625 --> 02:37:30.185]  A good job.
[02:37:30.285 --> 02:37:31.165]  Don in Texas.
[02:37:31.265 --> 02:37:32.126]  Don go ahead.
[02:37:33.426 --> 02:37:34.026]  Hey Alex.
[02:37:34.286 --> 02:37:34.646]  Hello.
[02:37:35.226 --> 02:37:37.087]  Hey it's great having you man.
[02:37:38.274 --> 02:37:41.477]  I've just recently started listening to you in the past few months.
[02:37:41.878 --> 02:37:43.339]  I'm fairly new to Austin.
[02:37:43.499 --> 02:37:44.320]  I'm from Dallas.
[02:37:45.221 --> 02:37:49.345]  And my question for you is, I have a beautiful two-year-old daughter.
[02:37:49.365 --> 02:37:54.489]  I didn't know any of these issues going on with the vaccine.
[02:37:55.250 --> 02:38:00.996]  And so she has had all her vaccines up until now.
[02:38:01.316 --> 02:38:02.217]  Is there anything
[02:38:03.506 --> 02:38:09.908]  I mean, what kind of period is there where you start noticing if there's going to be problems or changes?
[02:38:10.108 --> 02:38:12.649]  Well, bottom line, sir, it's hurt your daughter.
[02:38:13.629 --> 02:38:18.391]  So you need to go through some chelation, but I'm not going to give you medical advice.
[02:38:18.411 --> 02:38:23.693]  Just go see a medical doctor, go see an alternative doctor, and do a detox that gets heavy metals out of the tissues.
[02:38:24.913 --> 02:38:25.433]  Okay.
[02:38:26.314 --> 02:38:28.394]  Because that stuff doesn't leave the body naturally.
[02:38:28.434 --> 02:38:30.375]  It just sits there in the brain.
[02:38:31.491 --> 02:38:35.815]  Okay, I mean, but there is things that can be done to... Yeah, until she's four.
[02:38:36.275 --> 02:38:41.479]  And it's still good after that, but after four, the brain really quits growing and a lot of it's going to be irreversible.
[02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:43.060]  Okay.
[02:38:43.501 --> 02:38:47.504]  The brain can rewire around it and is trying right now, despite the toxicity.
[02:38:47.524 --> 02:38:55.210]  We're very resilient, but... So research it, sir, and I mean, go see a doctor.
[02:38:56.098 --> 02:38:56.659]  All right, Alex.
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:38:59.225]  Thank you very much, and I appreciate everything that you're doing.
[02:38:59.446 --> 02:38:59.746]  You bet.
[02:38:59.786 --> 02:39:00.568]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:39:01.470 --> 02:39:03.154]  Michael in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:39:03.234 --> 02:39:03.816]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:39:05.549 --> 02:39:06.410]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:39:06.470 --> 02:39:06.730]  Good.
[02:39:06.850 --> 02:39:07.551]  Hey, I lost you.
[02:39:07.591 --> 02:39:08.972]  I wanted to talk to your guest.
[02:39:08.992 --> 02:39:15.477]  What happened was I had a conference call with a woman that my daughter goes to a school with and her daughter is 8 years old and has autism.
[02:39:16.177 --> 02:39:17.538]  She's very happy.
[02:39:17.778 --> 02:39:23.062]  She's sad but she's very happy about the show and she's ecstatic and I informed her.
[02:39:23.082 --> 02:39:26.245]  She had told me everything happened to her daughter after her MMR shot.
[02:39:27.861 --> 02:39:30.042]  It's unbelievable the autism this girl has.
[02:39:30.082 --> 02:39:31.923]  She's super hyperactive.
[02:39:31.963 --> 02:39:33.504]  She has no control.
[02:39:33.564 --> 02:39:34.645]  She can't talk.
[02:39:34.725 --> 02:39:36.747]  She just looks and meanders around.
[02:39:38.007 --> 02:39:39.969]  It's a great show, Alex, that you had this.
[02:39:40.009 --> 02:39:42.750]  I called her as soon as I heard it on the radio.
[02:39:43.811 --> 02:39:45.272]  She just was unbelievable.
[02:39:45.292 --> 02:39:45.752]  She was crying.
[02:39:45.792 --> 02:39:46.453]  She was so happy.
[02:39:47.122 --> 02:39:48.182]  So you're doing a great job.
[02:39:48.202 --> 02:39:48.322]  Why?
[02:39:48.342 --> 02:39:50.283]  Because you found out she can do some detoxing?
[02:39:50.303 --> 02:39:51.763]  She can do some detoxing, absolutely.
[02:39:51.823 --> 02:39:54.484]  And I have told her last year about this.
[02:39:54.584 --> 02:39:55.565]  It's from a vaccine.
[02:39:55.905 --> 02:39:58.045]  She was kind of a little bit leery, but she did some information.
[02:39:58.125 --> 02:39:59.166]  I sent her to your website.
[02:39:59.186 --> 02:40:03.087]  But when she heard your radio show program today, it really just opened her eyes up.
[02:40:03.387 --> 02:40:05.888]  And then she was able to hear about the detoxing.
[02:40:05.928 --> 02:40:07.608]  And so this is a wonderful thing, Alex.
[02:40:08.129 --> 02:40:12.350]  But here's my question to you, Alex, about the mercury that's in here.
[02:40:13.473 --> 02:40:19.176]  No, I don't believe that they, as your guest has said, I believe they're still lying and they're going to sit there and say they've changed everything.
[02:40:19.196 --> 02:40:21.518]  You heard the information from Dr. Geyer and I was aware of that.
[02:40:21.558 --> 02:40:22.238]  It's still in there.
[02:40:22.478 --> 02:40:23.018]  It's still in there.
[02:40:23.038 --> 02:40:28.021]  They caught them, I have associated press, they caught them increasing the amount.
[02:40:29.522 --> 02:40:33.284]  It's unbelievable and I believe it's all dumbing down our society, Alex.
[02:40:33.304 --> 02:40:38.047]  You look at the television programs they have for children now, totally idiocy, you know,
[02:40:39.119 --> 02:40:44.363]  No, mindless garbage, and it's the way they want our society headed, Alex, and I truly believe that.
[02:40:44.463 --> 02:40:51.068]  But, you know, you're doing a great job on the show, and I just want to thank you for having that great guest today, because it really helped my friend out with her daughter.
[02:40:51.228 --> 02:40:52.068]  Well, thank you, Mike.
[02:40:52.108 --> 02:40:52.649]  Take care.
[02:40:52.669 --> 02:40:59.174]  What we need is all the listeners to start their own vaccine awareness websites, and have the forms, and have the information, and have all the documents.
[02:40:59.814 --> 02:41:03.377]  All of us have to be leaders in educating and informing and warning others.
[02:41:03.477 --> 02:41:05.278]  It's our responsibility.
[02:41:06.441 --> 02:41:07.382]  Not just our right.
[02:41:08.203 --> 02:41:11.326]  Let's talk to Wesley in Tennessee and then Alan and that's going to be it for calls.
[02:41:11.386 --> 02:41:12.166]  Wesley, go ahead.
[02:41:14.228 --> 02:41:15.189]  Thanks an awful lot, Alex.
[02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:23.276]  I have a question unrelated to a vaccine but one that's really of critical importance to us as a country.
[02:41:24.217 --> 02:41:33.145]  Can you tell me if those four extra carrier groups have returned to port or do we still have
[02:41:34.195 --> 02:41:34.595]  What is it?
[02:41:34.735 --> 02:41:36.257]  Eight, I think, at sea right now?
[02:41:37.037 --> 02:41:37.398]  Nine.
[02:41:37.598 --> 02:41:37.898]  Nine?
[02:41:38.619 --> 02:41:40.400]  Yeah, a record amount of aircraft carriers.
[02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:49.188]  Some are off the coast of North Korea, others are in the Arabian Sea, and others are in the Atlantic.
[02:41:49.248 --> 02:41:50.709]  Last time I checked, it's been a few weeks.
[02:41:51.069 --> 02:41:56.854]  Have we made any kind of agreements with any foreign countries?
[02:41:56.915 --> 02:41:58.676]  Well, there's all types of agreements.
[02:41:58.696 --> 02:42:02.099]  Well, I mean, you know, for instance, like,
[02:42:02.714 --> 02:42:03.174]  Canada.
[02:42:03.194 --> 02:42:07.316]  Are they committed to back us up in case of a crisis?
[02:42:07.376 --> 02:42:07.837]  Canada?
[02:42:07.897 --> 02:42:10.138]  I mean, Canada doesn't really have a military.
[02:42:10.458 --> 02:42:11.919]  Well, just anybody.
[02:42:12.879 --> 02:42:19.863]  Well, yeah, there's the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and there's the EU military, and there's the UN, and they've all got agreements.
[02:42:21.284 --> 02:42:21.884]  That's wonderful.
[02:42:21.924 --> 02:42:25.446]  So we can expect to be seeing those guys parading up and down our streets.
[02:42:26.414 --> 02:42:27.715]  Probably around election time.
[02:42:27.735 --> 02:42:33.877]  Well, I don't know, but it looks like they're going to be attacking Iran real soon.
[02:42:35.038 --> 02:42:36.859]  Yeah, that looks like it's wired, Alex.
[02:42:36.939 --> 02:42:37.539]  It really does.
[02:42:37.619 --> 02:42:39.460]  I mean, the handwriting's on the wall.
[02:42:40.901 --> 02:42:42.461]  If we don't, Israel will.
[02:42:43.222 --> 02:42:45.463]  You know, that's what it basically comes down to.
[02:42:45.523 --> 02:42:46.923]  One of the two countries, and maybe both.
[02:42:46.943 --> 02:42:50.405]  And they got the national draft lined up for us after the next convenient terror attack.
[02:42:50.445 --> 02:42:51.145]  Thanks for the call, Wes.
[02:42:51.165 --> 02:42:51.526]  Thank you.
[02:42:52.466 --> 02:42:54.007]  Allen in Texas, last caller.
[02:42:54.047 --> 02:42:54.627]  Go ahead, Allen.
[02:42:55.779 --> 02:42:56.379]  Hello, Alex.
[02:42:56.680 --> 02:42:57.000]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:57.180 --> 02:43:00.942]  It was good to see you down there at the ACTV meeting last night.
[02:43:01.042 --> 02:43:04.984]  Hey, you know, I was going to get to that next, and again, they're shutting down access to television all over the country.
[02:43:05.004 --> 02:43:09.006]  They had a board meeting last night, and we got the corporate minutes that they didn't want to release.
[02:43:09.046 --> 02:43:17.291]  We got it from the city, where four months ago they said that if you criticize a group or talk about somebody on the air, you're going to be kicked off the channels.
[02:43:17.651 --> 02:43:24.095]  So, admitted, and I stood up and read from their own document, and boy, I watched the video of that.
[02:43:24.475 --> 02:43:26.777]  They have the air taken out of them real quick.
[02:43:27.037 --> 02:43:29.139]  What did you think of the hundreds of people that showed up for that?
[02:43:29.299 --> 02:43:33.823]  I think it's amazing because at the previous meeting at the City Council there were two of us.
[02:43:34.104 --> 02:43:37.386]  And I told you that fellow from the board jumped to me after the meeting.
[02:43:37.407 --> 02:43:41.590]  I thought he was going to beat me up the way he was pacing back and forth telling me that I shouldn't be talking.
[02:43:41.770 --> 02:43:42.751]  You talking about Franks?
[02:43:43.432 --> 02:43:47.195]  A large, bald man, dark complexion.
[02:43:47.215 --> 02:43:49.257]  I want to say Henry.
[02:43:50.481 --> 02:43:52.762]  No, no, Henry's a Hispanic board member.
[02:43:52.802 --> 02:43:53.582]  No, no, no, that's not him.
[02:43:53.782 --> 02:43:56.343]  You're talking about one of the unelected board members.
[02:43:56.403 --> 02:43:57.944]  I know who you're talking about.
[02:43:57.964 --> 02:44:02.005]  Yeah, anyways, and he told me, you know, I had no right to talk if I didn't know what I was talking about.
[02:44:02.045 --> 02:44:09.408]  And I just thought it was amazing that last night we showed up with 200 more people who don't know what they're talking about.
[02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:12.131]  And who just know they don't want their rights removed.
[02:44:12.151 --> 02:44:15.371]  Well, we had 200 people at the first telecommunications meeting, then the city meeting.
[02:44:15.391 --> 02:44:19.912]  They wouldn't even tell us what time it was, so I just said it was there, and I think about 10 people showed up.
[02:44:19.932 --> 02:44:24.533]  Well, I think educating people on what is going on down there is crucial, and what I've seen... Hey, hey, hold on.
[02:44:24.573 --> 02:44:26.714]  Did you get a copy of the minutes?
[02:44:26.894 --> 02:44:31.275]  I posted it on the web, and I would like to invite everyone to look at those documents.
[02:44:31.395 --> 02:44:32.195]  Where are they posted?
[02:44:32.475 --> 02:44:33.977]  Austin Wheatgrass dot com.
[02:44:34.037 --> 02:44:35.399]  Yeah, this is one of our sponsors.
[02:44:35.419 --> 02:44:36.340]  You're a good guy.
[02:44:36.420 --> 02:44:37.822]  Austin Wheatgrass dot com.
[02:44:37.902 --> 02:44:40.025]  We're going to link over to that at Infowars dot com.
[02:44:40.045 --> 02:44:41.447]  Big, huge link on the first page.
[02:44:41.487 --> 02:44:50.358]  It has all the board meeting notes and the work of Marie Garrazio, who has done a real good job of interpreting this whole
[02:44:50.984 --> 02:45:04.982]  ...scenario, what it means, the things that are going on at City... Well, it openly says for the meeting in April that they said if you criticize a religion or a group, you're going to be kicked off the channel.
[02:45:05.062 --> 02:45:06.404]  It actually says it!
[02:45:06.824 --> 02:45:14.590]  Oh yeah, and like I told you when Austin Partners or the Time Warner people approached me... We got hate crimes right here in Austin now.
[02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:17.893]  You criticize somebody, you're off, and they're saying, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.
[02:45:17.933 --> 02:45:22.977]  Oh yeah, and I said, well on this new improved music station that you're going to control, if we want to come on with...
[02:45:23.652 --> 02:45:26.574]  The George W. Bush singers, music of dissent, what will you do?
[02:45:26.594 --> 02:45:36.299]  And I said, oh, we'll have to have meetings and make decisions on... So the oldest birthplace of AXS TV, no censorship, we're going to take two of your channels and then regulate what you do on the other one.
[02:45:36.479 --> 02:45:37.499]  Why don't you like it?
[02:45:37.559 --> 02:45:38.580]  What's wrong with you?
[02:45:38.900 --> 02:45:42.141]  Right, and I wanted to, like I said, invite everyone to my site to look at that.
[02:45:42.161 --> 02:45:45.081]  And I've taken the products off, so this will not be a commercial plug.
[02:45:45.281 --> 02:45:46.341]  Hey, that's okay!
[02:45:46.381 --> 02:45:46.841]  No, no, no.
[02:45:46.882 --> 02:45:48.202]  Listen, I've got all the documents.
[02:45:48.322 --> 02:45:50.082]  I haven't gotten around to having my webmaster put them up.
[02:45:50.122 --> 02:45:50.962]  I wrote a press release.
[02:45:50.982 --> 02:45:52.483]  It took hours Sunday.
[02:45:52.863 --> 02:45:54.303]  I got the documents yesterday.
[02:45:54.323 --> 02:45:58.964]  We're going to be putting them up too, but if folks want to see them now, it's AustinWheatgrass.com?
[02:45:59.224 --> 02:46:00.284]  Austin Wheatgrass, yes.
[02:46:00.364 --> 02:46:05.545]  And I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to add some email links to some city council people.
[02:46:06.429 --> 02:46:14.893]  I'm getting ready for legal action too folks that want to join in on this because I mean this would be like having the board of Greenpeace suddenly say we're for whaling.
[02:46:15.994 --> 02:46:23.678]  Or it'd be like having the Heart and Lung Association say we advise you to smoke five packs of Lucky Strikes filterless a day under a gallon of Jack Daniels.
[02:46:23.738 --> 02:46:24.498]  It's good for your heart.
[02:46:24.718 --> 02:46:27.780]  Well you know all this started out as rumors and it's all turning out to be true.
[02:46:27.820 --> 02:46:28.920]  Well it wasn't rumors sir.
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:30.201]  I told you a month and a half ago.
[02:46:30.221 --> 02:46:32.362]  Remember I said a month and a half ago I have my city source.
[02:46:32.962 --> 02:46:33.223]  Right.
[02:46:33.483 --> 02:46:35.946]  And then I talked to the board and I talked to the telecommunications.
[02:46:36.426 --> 02:46:38.689]  I mean, when do you know me to make stuff up, Alan?
[02:46:38.809 --> 02:46:53.606]  Not yet, but there have been rumors also that Time Warner has used some pretty underhanded tricks to thwart the efforts of ACTV to stay on its... I mean, to sponsor themselves using local hotels.
[02:46:54.281 --> 02:46:57.744]  As sponsors to generate funds to save... Yeah, look, there's no need.
[02:46:57.944 --> 02:46:59.445]  Access TV has plenty of money.
[02:46:59.486 --> 02:47:00.847]  The city's raiding those funds.
[02:47:01.067 --> 02:47:06.171]  Well, if Time Warner, though, has stepped on their efforts, done anything... No, that's admitted.
[02:47:06.211 --> 02:47:06.892]  That's public, sir.
[02:47:06.932 --> 02:47:07.612]  That's been in meetings.
[02:47:07.632 --> 02:47:09.974]  Well, that's a violation of some antitrust laws.
[02:47:10.014 --> 02:47:15.739]  Time Warner needs to be sued for stepping on those efforts to gain sponsorships.
[02:47:15.759 --> 02:47:18.782]  I mean, if this time... Well, you were there last night.
[02:47:18.822 --> 02:47:22.465]  I had to leave halfway through to go do my live TV show, but what happened after I left?
[02:47:24.221 --> 02:47:26.022]  It continued, person after person.
[02:47:26.062 --> 02:47:26.943]  I didn't get to talk.
[02:47:27.083 --> 02:47:27.783]  We ran out of time.
[02:47:27.803 --> 02:47:34.068]  Well, it's austinchronicle.com, the site where the letters of the editor are posted.
[02:47:34.268 --> 02:47:38.211]  People ought to email them the minutes of AXS TV and go, look at this!
[02:47:38.271 --> 02:47:40.173]  They admit controlling speech!
[02:47:40.453 --> 02:47:42.654]  Now, what do you idiots say now for yourselves?
[02:47:43.375 --> 02:47:51.401]  I just hope that everyone will, at the next meeting, at the next public forum, at the next city council meeting, all of you come back again and bring three people
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:53.481]  I mean, we want to turn from 2 to 200 to 600.
[02:47:53.741 --> 02:48:01.205]  What we need is people to go to just the next general City Council meeting, sign up for Citizens Communication, and speak on this issue, period.
[02:48:01.425 --> 02:48:05.226]  And say, remove that board, or anybody on the board who is for this.
[02:48:05.947 --> 02:48:07.828]  And stop going after Axios Television.
[02:48:07.988 --> 02:48:09.128]  Educate yourself first.
[02:48:09.188 --> 02:48:12.870]  Go to Austin Wheatgrass, get the information, and get smart about this stuff.
[02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:15.551]  So, they'll see that you know what you're talking about.
[02:48:15.571 --> 02:48:18.793]  And if there are a thousand of us down there who know what we're talking about,
[02:48:19.301 --> 02:48:20.822]  City Council is going to start getting scared.
[02:48:20.842 --> 02:48:21.282]  They're going to sweat.
[02:48:21.302 --> 02:48:22.502]  They're going to have to listen to us.
[02:48:23.663 --> 02:48:24.243]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:48:24.323 --> 02:48:24.663]  Thank you.
[02:48:24.683 --> 02:48:26.804]  Well, a thousand showed up and said they didn't want toll roads.
[02:48:26.824 --> 02:48:28.204]  They said, we're going to give them to you.
[02:48:28.845 --> 02:48:30.045]  Toll roads on every street.
[02:48:30.125 --> 02:48:30.945]  We don't care.
[02:48:31.466 --> 02:48:34.247]  Because we got the electronic voting machines.
[02:48:34.967 --> 02:48:37.888]  Looks like litigation is the next step, but I want to thank everybody for showing up.
[02:48:38.148 --> 02:48:41.650]  I'll hit some final news and a news and information blitz on the other side.
[02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:42.250]  You don't want to miss it?
[02:48:42.270 --> 02:48:42.670]  Stay with us.
[02:48:45.470 --> 02:48:46.971]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.151 --> 02:48:50.233]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.373 --> 02:48:54.275]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.315 --> 02:48:58.557]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:58.898 --> 02:49:02.680]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:04.621]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:04.941 --> 02:49:08.124]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.164 --> 02:49:12.869]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.029 --> 02:49:16.072]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.252 --> 02:49:19.155]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.615 --> 02:49:25.741]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.261 --> 02:49:30.043]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:49:57.913 --> 02:50:02.579]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.059 --> 02:50:09.763]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:10.163 --> 02:50:21.970]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[02:50:45.811 --> 02:50:46.112]  I think so.
[02:51:01.093 --> 02:51:01.694]  I think so.

[02:51:45.826 --> 02:51:51.370]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.005 --> 02:51:54.986]  Yeah, think about that.
[02:51:55.026 --> 02:51:57.027]  You get the minutes of the ACTV board.
[02:51:57.047 --> 02:51:58.427]  This is happening all over the nation.
[02:51:59.308 --> 02:52:02.269]  And it says we're not going to let people criticize or do anything on the channels.
[02:52:02.309 --> 02:52:03.070]  That's your new freedom.
[02:52:04.530 --> 02:52:05.831]  That's your new freedom, folks.
[02:52:06.311 --> 02:52:09.393]  And all the denials, all of it, it's just taking place.
[02:52:11.114 --> 02:52:13.195]  And the newspaper attacking me for exposing it.
[02:52:13.915 --> 02:52:16.657]  But I want to thank everybody that showed up last night.
[02:52:16.717 --> 02:52:17.777]  I'd say over 200 people.
[02:52:18.218 --> 02:52:21.879]  CIA halted a plan to kidnap bin Laden in 1998.
[02:52:24.002 --> 02:52:28.023]  That's how the Irish Examiner, another story, documents uncovered proving U.S.
[02:52:28.483 --> 02:52:37.525]  doctors aided torturers in Abu Ghraib, and even ministry sources admit that medical staff participated in the torture.
[02:52:37.565 --> 02:52:39.145]  So our doctors are torture masters.
[02:52:39.165 --> 02:52:39.725]  Isn't that nice?
[02:52:41.106 --> 02:52:43.466]  Kerry still would have approved force in Iraq.
[02:52:43.486 --> 02:52:44.567]  Just incredible statements.
[02:52:44.587 --> 02:52:50.428]  He made them again yesterday, not just on Monday, that, oh yeah, even if weapons of mass destruction weren't there, I'm for invading.
[02:52:50.468 --> 02:52:51.128]  My goodness!
[02:52:52.219 --> 02:53:05.130]  And Bush mocked him, saying, now almost two years after he voted for the war in Iraq, almost 220 days after switching positions to declare himself anti-war, my opponent has found a new nuisance, Bush said.
[02:53:05.511 --> 02:53:09.194]  After months of questioning my motives and even my credibility, Senator Kerry now agrees with me.
[02:53:09.214 --> 02:53:12.016]  Yeah, your cousin came to your aid, along with traitor McCain.
[02:53:12.857 --> 02:53:17.962]  Bush's job rating falls a new low, this out of the Sacramento Bee.
[02:53:19.131 --> 02:53:29.535]  And it says California's appraisal of President Bush's job performance hit a new record low, largely because voters' view of his handling of the terrorist threats has deteriorated according to a new statewide poll.
[02:53:30.855 --> 02:53:32.976]  And he's down to an all-time low of 33%.
[02:53:36.427 --> 02:53:39.528]  Uh, it says, uh, oh boy, that's not good.
[02:53:40.048 --> 02:53:41.809]  And national polls are showing the same thing.
[02:53:42.149 --> 02:53:46.671]  And again, Bush wants to pay illegal aliens to come to this country and give them extra welfare than citizens.
[02:53:47.051 --> 02:53:48.271]  That's the Washington Times.
[02:53:48.791 --> 02:53:50.092]  And of course, uh, U.S.
[02:53:51.225 --> 02:53:54.269]  Screwed up by outing its own Al-Qaeda mole.
[02:53:54.289 --> 02:53:56.051]  They didn't mess up, Capitol Hill blew.
[02:53:56.471 --> 02:54:06.042]  A revelation that a mole within Al-Qaeda was exposed after Washington launched its orange alert this month has shocked security experts who say the outing of the source may have set back the war on terror.
[02:54:07.299 --> 02:54:16.725]  Reuters learned from Pakistani intelligence sources on Friday that computer expert Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan, arrested secretly in July, was working undercover to help the authorities.
[02:54:16.785 --> 02:54:17.966]  See, they always arrest their moles.
[02:54:18.286 --> 02:54:19.267]  And that's always a big arrest.
[02:54:19.607 --> 02:54:23.470]  Tracked down Al-Qaeda militants in Britain and the United States when his name appeared in U.S.
[02:54:23.530 --> 02:54:24.050]  newspapers.
[02:54:24.150 --> 02:54:28.173]  After his capture, he admitted being an Al-Qaeda member and agreed to send emails to his contacts.
[02:54:28.513 --> 02:54:33.036]  Pakistani intelligence source told Reuters he sent encoded emails and received encoded replies.
[02:54:33.336 --> 02:54:34.757]  He's a great hacker and even the U.S.
[02:54:34.857 --> 02:54:36.459]  agents said he was a computer whiz.
[02:54:36.479 --> 02:54:37.119]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:54:38.599 --> 02:54:41.000]  Now they've blown that wide open, that whole organization.
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:43.601]  Of course, they've got to protect their LCI Ada.
[02:54:44.621 --> 02:54:46.441]  So, a very, very interesting.
[02:54:46.501 --> 02:54:49.222]  Scientists give cloning go-ahead.
[02:54:49.322 --> 02:54:55.884]  British scientists have been given permission to perform therapeutic cloning using human embryos for the first time.
[02:54:55.904 --> 02:55:01.265]  The Human Fertilization and Embryonic Authority granted license to experts at the University of Newcastle.
[02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:03.530]  Interesting little article there.
[02:55:03.590 --> 02:55:07.553]  Iran test missile capable of hitting Israel.
[02:55:07.593 --> 02:55:08.374]  This is Reuters.
[02:55:08.454 --> 02:55:18.803]  Iran's Defense Ministry said on Wednesday it had carried out a field test of the latest version of the Shalab-3 medium-range ballistic missile, which defense experts say can reach Israel or U.S.
[02:55:18.863 --> 02:55:19.524]  bases in the Gulf.
[02:55:20.004 --> 02:55:32.417]  Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said last week that Iran was working on improvements to the range and accuracy of the Shalab-3 in response to Israel's move to boost its anti-missile capacity.
[02:55:33.438 --> 02:55:35.460]  So Iran is really escalating this.
[02:55:37.542 --> 02:55:39.003]  The globalists are escalating it.
[02:55:39.063 --> 02:55:40.405]  It's very, very serious.
[02:55:40.545 --> 02:55:41.606]  One more article here.
[02:55:43.550 --> 02:55:49.114]  CBS newsman Mike Wallace was rude to some people that said his law was part wrong.
[02:55:49.174 --> 02:55:51.535]  So later he was arrested and they said, we're being rude.
[02:55:52.456 --> 02:55:53.356]  Not allowed to be rude.
[02:55:53.376 --> 02:55:55.037]  See, even the Lords are getting in trouble.
[02:55:55.497 --> 02:55:58.179]  One more CNN Law section.
[02:55:58.539 --> 02:56:00.140]  Remove Bible from courthouse.
[02:56:00.621 --> 02:56:05.764]  A judge on Tuesday ordered Harris County to remove a Bible from a monument outside its civil courts building.
[02:56:05.784 --> 02:56:06.524]  This is in Texas.
[02:56:06.864 --> 02:56:10.907]  Ruling that the display violates the constitutional separation between church and state.
[02:56:11.505 --> 02:56:12.786]  But the Greek gods are fine.
[02:56:13.146 --> 02:56:15.688]  Our law is based on Mosaic Law!
[02:56:16.469 --> 02:56:18.710]  And to get rid of that gets rid of the basis of our law.
[02:56:19.431 --> 02:56:20.632]  Out of time, my friends.
[02:56:20.732 --> 02:56:22.153]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:22.693 --> 02:56:24.094]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 central.
[02:56:24.114 --> 02:56:24.855]  Be sure and join us.
[02:56:24.875 --> 02:56:29.738]  I want to thank all of you that are active and taking action around the country and those that showed up last night.
[02:56:30.359 --> 02:56:31.379]  There'll be many more battles.
[02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:32.961]  We shall prevail, God willing.
[02:56:33.041 --> 02:56:34.021]  Take care and God bless.
