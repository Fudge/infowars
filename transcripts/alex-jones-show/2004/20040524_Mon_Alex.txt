[00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:06.555]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.276]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:10.077]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:11.558]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.318 --> 00:00:13.219]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.681]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:22.183]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:25.905]  Oh my goodness!
[00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:30.348]  I got a feeling this is gonna be a big week.
[00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:32.093]  What about you?
[00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:38.357]  It's Monday, the 24th day of May 2004.
[00:00:38.397 --> 00:00:42.080]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:53.728]  We'll be live for the next three hours and we're going to have wide open phones on all the vital news I'm about to cover or any news item or issue or question or comment that you have.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:04.025]  The toll-free number to join us, we'll go to your calls early in this hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:15.150]  Lord Bush had a quite serious bicycling accident over the weekend, they say, and tore his face and hands up.
[00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.893]  Of course, a few years ago, he supposedly choked on a pretzel and then fell down.
[00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:24.888]  Uh, had bruises and cuts on both sides of his face.
[00:01:25.048 --> 00:01:26.228]  Pretty hard to do.
[00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:28.230]  Takes multiple falls to do that.
[00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.552]  There's been discussions of his deteriorating mental state.
[00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.813]  I mean, he isn't the man he was just four or five years ago.
[00:01:33.873 --> 00:01:35.514]  The guy gave pretty good speeches in Texas.
[00:01:36.074 --> 00:01:36.875]  Looked pretty healthy.
[00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:39.816]  Does he have some type of disease?
[00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:43.819]  Is he having seizures?
[00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:56.250]  It's been the question that's been put out there, and we've got that all on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well as PrisonPlanet.tv, but it doesn't really matter because Bush is a total and complete puppet.
[00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.412]  He isn't running anything to begin with, but the puppet is having problems.
[00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:01.652]  Let's just put it to you that way.
[00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:07.614]  He falls off of a lot of things, but hey, he's getting on the field out there in the game of life.
[00:02:08.723 --> 00:02:12.787]  One of those doodads that, you know, roll down the street, the high-tech thing.
[00:02:12.827 --> 00:02:14.028]  He fell off one of those, too.
[00:02:14.528 --> 00:02:16.450]  Tell me, maybe he's just an active person.
[00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.492]  You know, if you're not active, you'll never have a problem.
[00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:22.896]  A Bush speech to try to assure Americans on Iraq.
[00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:25.959]  And I guess he's going to be up there with a bloodied face.
[00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.301]  By the way, they could have covered this up with makeup.
[00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:32.545]  Why is he trotting around with his bloody face with the little cuts all over it?
[00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.834]  We're posting, or they've probably already been posted, I don't know, 30 minutes ago they were being posted, those photographs of that.
[00:02:39.894 --> 00:02:41.816]  But again, side issue compared to the real news.
[00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:45.118]  More anti-terrorism powers sought.
[00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:53.764]  Again, we've told you about this for over a year now, but now they admit they introduced a bill over a year ago, and they want all of Patriot Act to pass.
[00:02:53.784 --> 00:02:56.266]  They've already passed some of it, December 13th last year.
[00:02:57.807 --> 00:03:00.809]  Also, Asia Times, highly respected news service,
[00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:07.970]  Experts have looked at the Berg video and say it's fake.
[00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:09.451]  Probably a mannequin.
[00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:11.933]  They're not cutting somebody's head off there.
[00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:14.996]  That's just amazing.
[00:03:15.936 --> 00:03:25.824]  Shalibi, the torture master and convicted bank robber, who's in at least surface trouble with the regional governorship in Iraq, says he's not working for Iran.
[00:03:25.864 --> 00:03:26.825]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:53.496]  uh... and uh... we will also get into uh... a p video showing iraq wedding celebration the dead mom children at that uh... wedding rumsfeld banning digital cameras in the prisons of iraq he doesn't want that evidence getting out there anymore at least that's what he's saying and there's some discussion it's unconfirmed that you know digital cameras now have their own personal i d number that can be assumed on
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:11.305]  And according to this report here, it looks like the same Kodak camera, the same, not just model, but the same camera was used in some of the torture video from then some of the still photos that were supposedly released of the burg beheading.
[00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:13.266]  But again, this could be disinfo.
[00:04:13.646 --> 00:04:14.426]  It's not confirmed.
[00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:20.488]  So we'll be getting into that for you as well as soon as we come back out of this quick break.
[00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:25.603]  There's a lot of other energy news concerning the petrol, the oil, the gasoline.
[00:04:27.103 --> 00:04:30.024]  Surging, what, up to like 215 now, national average.
[00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:36.247]  And in some areas we're paying, again, 375 a gallon on the west and east coast.
[00:04:38.327 --> 00:04:44.970]  Well, the Saudis are saying they want to pump some more oil out to help Lord Bush, but other groups in the OPEC are saying no.
[00:04:45.984 --> 00:04:49.048]  I'll give you my take on this as well.
[00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.111]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:57.300]  You're tuned into the first five minutes of this three-hour broadcast, and I want to thank you personally for joining us.
[00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:06.999]  Old-timers remember a time when things were a bit slower and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:12.801]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.362]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:16.562]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:05:16.722 --> 00:05:21.624]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses.
[00:05:21.864 --> 00:05:26.628]  Artificially ripened with gas could be grown much quicker fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:36.415]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:45.762]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:48.264]  Call the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company at 417-924-8917.
[00:05:48.304 --> 00:05:52.046]  That's 417-924-8917 or visit rareseeds.com and get started on the pathway to great gardening and great flavor!
[00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.332]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:09.954]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:10.094 --> 00:06:14.456]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:06:14.576 --> 00:06:15.877]  A New World Order.
[00:06:17.658 --> 00:06:21.883]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.943 --> 00:06:28.871]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:31.014]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.394 --> 00:06:41.716]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.996 --> 00:06:47.357]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:47.877 --> 00:06:51.397]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:06:51.798 --> 00:06:52.938]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:07:00.578 --> 00:07:09.204]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:20.713]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:07:20.913 --> 00:07:23.555]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:30.361]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:32.402]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:07:32.603 --> 00:07:38.628]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:07:38.868 --> 00:07:44.533]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:07:44.873 --> 00:07:48.795]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:48.815 --> 00:07:49.516]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:50.236]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:50.256 --> 00:07:52.917]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.655 --> 00:08:15.776]  All right, into the second segment, 8 minutes and 12 seconds into the first hour.
[00:08:16.877 --> 00:08:17.857]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:17.917 --> 00:08:20.297]  We're going to launch into some of the top news stories.
[00:08:20.317 --> 00:08:24.338]  Then we'll go to your calls and then go into these articles in more detail.
[00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:26.939]  And the total free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:28.939]  Bush speech to try to assure Americans on Iraq.
[00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:43.430]  The Road Rash President, with his bloodied face, I guess is going to be on national television this evening.
[00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:59.035]  With support for his Iraq policies at an all-time low, President Bush will deliver a primetime speech on Monday, seeking to assure the public he has a strategy for handing over power to Iraqis and keeping the violence from spiraling out of control.
[00:08:59.682 --> 00:09:08.046]  Bush said his aides are also stepping up outreach to key members of the United Nations to support a new resolution that will shape post-occupation Iraq.
[00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:20.955]  The November presidential election could be profoundly influenced by what happens in Iraq beginning with five weeks that remain before the transfer of limited authority to an interim Iraqi government on June 30th and immediate aftermath.
[00:09:21.455 --> 00:09:21.755]  Wow!
[00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:35.707]  I want to commend Wired News Service of Wired Magazine for actually saying limited authority because when you read the Associated Press or Reuters or BBC for that matter or ABC News it's total authority, democracy, freedom
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.664]  The first Governing Council was 324 appointed people.
[00:09:40.586 --> 00:09:45.873]  The new Governing Council will be appointed by the appointees.
[00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:49.818]  There's going to be this giant 3,000 person command base.
[00:09:49.838 --> 00:09:53.563]  They're calling it an embassy, but that's the brains of the whole system.
[00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:56.039]  Bremer is going to be out.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:06.182]  We're going to have Necroponte, the torture master of Latin American fame and old CIA ties back to the Vietnam War.
[00:10:06.822 --> 00:10:09.963]  He's going to be running things there as the regional governor.
[00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:12.944]  The administrator, as they call it.
[00:10:13.544 --> 00:10:19.546]  And look, a year before the war, Romano Prati, the head of the EU at the time, now head ambassador from the EU,
[00:10:20.367 --> 00:10:22.209]  Yeah, it was a meeting with Bush.
[00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:31.117]  It was publicly in the back of the news wires, never in the newspaper, that we were going to go in, take over, and then hand it over to the U.N.
[00:10:31.157 --> 00:10:31.437]  later.
[00:10:31.738 --> 00:10:38.504]  And then I said, you watch, we're going to butcher, we're going to kill, we're going to abuse, we're going to bulldoze houses, and then the U.N.
[00:10:38.524 --> 00:10:46.051]  will come in and they won't do all that, they'll dominate and control and enslave and take the oil, but because they don't just murder everyone en masse, they'll be the good cops.
[00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:50.355]  And this is exactly what they did, because this is how empires manipulate.
[00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:51.696]  The British are classic for this.
[00:10:51.736 --> 00:10:57.562]  They'll put in a mean governor at first for a few years, and then publicly reprimand him, and then send in the savior.
[00:10:58.002 --> 00:11:12.155]  I mean, Julius Caesar, in the Battle for Gaul, written 2,000 years ago, a collection of letters to the Roman Senate, bragged about how he manipulated the Germanic tribes of Gaul, and then into Germany, the Visigoths.
[00:11:13.644 --> 00:11:17.205]  So, I mean, there's actual textbooks on how to do this.
[00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:19.386]  It's not like, oh, Alex, how do you know?
[00:11:19.466 --> 00:11:22.967]  How do you, before it happens, see exactly what's going to transpire?
[00:11:23.047 --> 00:11:26.488]  Because this is a literal textbook, people!
[00:11:26.508 --> 00:11:30.289]  I mean, it's not very hard!
[00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.970]  I'm not that, I'm not even that smart!
[00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.951]  And this is what frustrates me.
[00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:38.532]  I just know history, and so I'm way ahead of almost everybody else.
[00:11:39.258 --> 00:11:45.063]  And if you'll learn history, you won't be doomed to repeat it as the cliche goes, as the truism goes.
[00:11:46.344 --> 00:11:53.230]  Oh, by the way, another issue here that I need to cover before I get into all this news.
[00:11:53.750 --> 00:12:04.840]  He's been on this broadcast in the past, and I learned this weekend that Clay Douglas had been in a bad motorcycle accident in Arizona.
[00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:10.832]  And there were mixed reports about him on the edge of death or him okay.
[00:12:10.912 --> 00:12:19.357]  So I called his office and talked to one of his office managers, Levy and Bowden, for about 15 minutes.
[00:12:19.637 --> 00:12:21.018]  And let me just read this quick blurb.
[00:12:21.378 --> 00:12:26.962]  On Saturday morning, I called the Free American Business Office and spoke for about 15 minutes with Clay Douglas, office manager.
[00:12:27.991 --> 00:12:34.975]  Mr. Imboden told me that both he and Clay Douglas' son, Cameron Douglas, believed at this time that there was no foul play involved.
[00:12:34.995 --> 00:12:36.156]  You know, he's a patriot.
[00:12:36.176 --> 00:12:38.417]  People think someone might try to kill him.
[00:12:39.237 --> 00:12:44.900]  Mr. Imboden stated that a woman had pulled out in front of Clay on North 24th Street in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:55.366]  Mr. Douglas' office also informed us that Clay does not have a hole in his skull, as was reported earlier, and that there is no plan at this time for him to undergo brain surgery.
[00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:01.196]  One of the doctors at the Maricopa County General Hospital told Mr. Imboden that Clay is doing a lot better.
[00:13:01.216 --> 00:13:05.961]  He does have several broken ribs, a broken clavicle, and a large gash on his head.
[00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:14.731]  And it says that Levi Imboden also told us that the police have sighted the individual who was involved in some type of collision with Clay.
[00:13:15.271 --> 00:13:23.338]  Mr. Imboden went on to say that he had visited Clay last night, now Saturday night, and that Clay was moving his legs despite being heavily sedated.
[00:13:23.698 --> 00:13:28.482]  He said the doctor was sedating Clay so that movement would not worsen his serious concussion.
[00:13:29.363 --> 00:13:36.869]  And Clay is not a young man and this is still a serious situation, but at least this is better news than what we were hearing a few days ago.
[00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.833]  So, I saw all these rumors flying around, so I thought, well, I'll just call and check on it.
[00:13:42.454 --> 00:13:43.775]  I was concerned about Clay and
[00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:49.666]  At least found out some more facts from the people actually at his office.
[00:13:50.947 --> 00:13:57.749]  Okay, jumping back into the news, again Bush to give this big speech to try to assure Americans on Iraq.
[00:13:58.749 --> 00:14:02.710]  Jumping into other news, more anti-terrorism powers sought.
[00:14:03.422 --> 00:14:05.483]  This out of Knight Ridder News Service.
[00:14:06.143 --> 00:14:10.045]  Washington, the Justice Department, is seeking to expand its anti-terrorism powers.
[00:14:10.505 --> 00:14:12.546]  And again, all crimes are terrorism under this.
[00:14:13.066 --> 00:14:19.729]  Adding, among other things, an FBI subpoena power so secret that even a lawsuit challenging it had to be kept under wraps.
[00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.932]  Now, how do you have a lawsuit challenging powers that are being used?
[00:14:26.472 --> 00:14:31.154]  And this has been going on for a year, but it hasn't even been passed yet.
[00:14:31.235 --> 00:14:32.015]  Well, because
[00:14:32.908 --> 00:14:37.171]  Much of Patriot Act II was passed in December 13, 2003.
[00:14:38.913 --> 00:14:51.222]  But even prior to that, even prior to January 2003, right after they passed Patriot Act I, they began to implement the powers that were unpassed, that were not conferred by the Congress.
[00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:55.878]  That had been in Patriot Act II.
[00:14:56.078 --> 00:15:09.515]  So, there's lawsuits involved, enemy combatant designations, secretly grabbing citizens, persons of interest being secretly executed, no trials, torture, national DNA databases,
[00:15:11.357 --> 00:15:15.481]  This is all already being implemented, the secret arrest, the rest of it.
[00:15:15.662 --> 00:15:25.312]  We don't know about the secret executions, though quite a few people are dying of natural causes, they say, at the different camps, the different private corporate camps overseas.
[00:15:26.713 --> 00:15:27.494]  So, they've already
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.721]  Implemented this.
[00:15:30.061 --> 00:15:33.585]  And so the Justice Department is seeking to expand its anti-terrorism powers again.
[00:15:33.605 --> 00:15:40.292]  Adding, among other things, an FBI subpoena power so secret that even a lawsuit challenging it had to be kept under wraps.
[00:15:40.312 --> 00:15:41.774]  See, what's wrong with that sentence?
[00:15:42.795 --> 00:15:44.016]  This hasn't been passed.
[00:15:44.037 --> 00:15:45.238]  They're wanting to pass it.
[00:15:46.516 --> 00:15:50.778]  But there's already lawsuits challenging cases where it's been used.
[00:15:51.238 --> 00:16:04.544]  Experts say the challenges, which are moving piecemeal through Congress in several bills, the changes, not the challenges, are among the most significant since Congress passed the USA Patriot Act in the frightening days of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.
[00:16:06.858 --> 00:16:08.999]  Why are they getting all this new legislation ready?
[00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:10.120]  Victory Act 1 and 2.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.721]  Segments of Patriot Act.
[00:16:12.121 --> 00:16:15.363]  Because they're obviously getting ready to light up the town.
[00:16:15.804 --> 00:16:17.144]  To blow some stuff up.
[00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:18.965]  The White House told U.S.
[00:16:18.985 --> 00:16:22.888]  News and World Report last week the Capitol will be destroyed.
[00:16:23.968 --> 00:16:27.931]  They said it's going to happen and there will be giant terror attacks coast to coast.
[00:16:29.668 --> 00:16:32.991]  And there's nothing they can do to stop it unless you give up all your freedoms.
[00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:35.133]  I mean, they actually said this, folks.
[00:16:35.153 --> 00:16:45.081]  They're actually out there promoting this in a host of news articles and live appearances by slimy FBI agents and others, trying to scare you.
[00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:48.143]  And so they're getting it all lined up so they say, See?
[00:16:48.203 --> 00:16:50.365]  We told you you better do whatever we say.
[00:16:50.906 --> 00:16:53.708]  Better give up all your freedoms now or the boogeyman's gonna get you.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.925]  Daniel Bryant, the Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policies of the Patriot Act, has helped law enforcement detect and disrupt terrorist plots.
[00:17:00.965 --> 00:17:01.645]  You know, that's funny.
[00:17:02.506 --> 00:17:14.976]  Ashcroft, all last year, said there was no new terror legislation, no new Patriot Act 2, that it was a wild conspiracy theory, phantoms of lost liberty, those saying it were lying, trying to mislead.
[00:17:14.996 --> 00:17:18.299]  I have these video clips in Police State's Retitle Enslavement.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.083]  A year ago, just on and on and on, trying to scare people.
[00:17:24.093 --> 00:17:27.636]  It doesn't exist, you're crazy, and this is after it's introduced.
[00:17:28.377 --> 00:17:37.545]  And then I said, they're not going to announce all this and admit all this until they're ready to, uh, you know, set some buildings on fire like a Christmas tree.
[00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:40.988]  And here we are!
[00:17:41.188 --> 00:17:44.010]  That's right, they're back!
[00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.272]  They're getting ready!
[00:17:47.013 --> 00:17:50.636]  And we're trying to stop them, but, uh, oh boy.
[00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:57.553]  And, you know, it's the same line that, well, we need to have the same powers we have to fight criminals to fight terrorists.
[00:17:58.193 --> 00:18:00.374]  We've been using this against criminals for a long time.
[00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:01.055]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:18:01.095 --> 00:18:07.257]  You've been violating the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, grabbing old ladies' cash out of their purses for decades.
[00:18:07.598 --> 00:18:15.421]  You've been forcibly drugging people without even charging them for six, seven, eight years and holding them in solitary confinement because they criticized the government.
[00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:18.683]  Yes, you've been butchering the Bill of Rights for a while.
[00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:19.323]  It's true.
[00:18:19.363 --> 00:18:20.904]  So, you say that's a precedent.
[00:18:21.504 --> 00:18:27.307]  But no, you do expand things, though, to secretly arresting us and secretly blowing our heads off.
[00:18:27.427 --> 00:18:29.328]  Well, just as killing us, if you wish.
[00:18:30.028 --> 00:18:31.389]  However you plan to do that.
[00:18:33.009 --> 00:18:41.533]  And it says the Senate already has approved legislation making it easier for FBI agents to go after so-called lone wolf terrorists not affiliated with any known organization or foreign government.
[00:18:42.408 --> 00:18:51.091]  The House of Representatives is considering the same measure as part of a larger bill dubbed the Anti-Terrorism Intelligence Tools Improvement Act of 2003.
[00:18:52.471 --> 00:19:03.794]  And the provision would allow the government to conduct secret surveillance, they already have that unlimited, on suspected terrorists, or spies without proving that they have any affiliation with a foreign government or terrorist organization.
[00:19:04.194 --> 00:19:09.336]  So now they'll just call you a spy or a terrorist or a criminal, though there's no evidence or no affiliation with anything.
[00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:13.497]  Well, that's again already in the first Patriot Act under Section 802.
[00:19:13.817 --> 00:19:20.298]  So all they do in these articles is tell you about a few window dressings that are already in place and not the real meat and potatoes that are in these bills.
[00:19:20.538 --> 00:19:22.419]  And I'm in the process of reading this new bill.
[00:19:22.779 --> 00:19:27.380]  There's another Patriot Act, or whatever you want to call it, that was introduced about a month ago and that's on the website.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.841]  It shows a picture of an execution chair and it says, New Patriot Act wants to kill you.
[00:19:33.501 --> 00:19:34.541]  Click on that and you read the bill.
[00:19:36.677 --> 00:19:55.456]  But the big thing is it's this gag order where if you're being investigated for any crime you can't then get a lawyer or defend yourself or tell anyone you're being investigated and they order you to be a non-paid informant and you have to serve secretly for up to two decades without telling anyone you're serving secretly as their slave.
[00:19:55.496 --> 00:19:57.598]  So it's also secret slavery.
[00:19:58.679 --> 00:19:59.720]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:20:01.573 --> 00:20:02.314]  Terrorism!
[00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:03.234]  Terrorism!
[00:20:03.354 --> 00:20:09.419]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.261]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:13.983]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:20:14.383 --> 00:20:28.955]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:28.995 --> 00:20:29.315]  government.
[00:20:29.475 --> 00:20:31.277]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:20:31.637 --> 00:20:37.559]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.181]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:21:00.919 --> 00:21:02.460]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.740]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.322]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:07.442 --> 00:21:07.882]  Phenol?
[00:21:08.183 --> 00:21:15.306]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:21:15.606 --> 00:21:19.688]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:19.828 --> 00:21:20.268]  Fragrance?
[00:21:20.648 --> 00:21:25.411]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:25.531 --> 00:21:30.133]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:21:30.433 --> 00:21:32.975]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[00:21:33.255 --> 00:21:36.657]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:21:36.817 --> 00:21:40.380]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[00:22:00.959 --> 00:22:01.919]  Is America bankrupt?

[00:22:10.863 --> 00:22:13.404]  The problem is, it's not always easy to find great solutions.

[00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:07.337]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[00:23:07.717 --> 00:23:11.782]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[00:23:12.302 --> 00:23:19.510]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:27.394]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[00:23:27.754 --> 00:23:29.975]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[00:23:30.315 --> 00:23:33.577]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.

[00:24:18.251 --> 00:24:23.312]  Then I want to get into the latest Iraq developments, also the situation with Nick Berg.
[00:24:23.773 --> 00:24:25.833]  This is the Asia Times, highly respected.
[00:24:25.953 --> 00:24:29.574]  Berg beheading, no way, say, medical experts.
[00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:30.715]  Wait until we get into this.
[00:24:30.855 --> 00:24:35.616]  Also, Associated Press video shows Iraq wedding celebration.
[00:24:36.096 --> 00:24:41.198]  Now it's up to 44 dead, babies blown to little bitty pieces at a wedding.
[00:24:41.638 --> 00:24:42.718]  And they say, hey, so what?
[00:24:43.398 --> 00:24:46.059]  Rumsfeld bans camera phones in Iraq.
[00:24:47.119 --> 00:24:49.320]  The government's coming out with virtual borders.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.420]  Wait till you hear about this.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.081]  You can't have real borders, but we'll have virtual borders.
[00:24:54.121 --> 00:24:56.322]  That's really the cashless society control grid.
[00:24:56.722 --> 00:24:59.823]  But right now, Jonathan in Georgia, you're our first caller.
[00:24:59.903 --> 00:25:00.303]  Welcome.
[00:25:01.023 --> 00:25:02.484]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:25:03.264 --> 00:25:03.944]  Good.
[00:25:04.864 --> 00:25:11.566]  I wanted to call about something concerning the secret societies that I haven't heard anybody talk about.
[00:25:11.886 --> 00:25:12.166]  Okay.
[00:25:15.939 --> 00:25:25.066]  You claim that, um, I've heard you yourself claim this, that George Washington knew the threat of certain secret societies to overthrow society.
[00:25:25.106 --> 00:25:26.046]  Well, I didn't claim it.
[00:25:26.106 --> 00:25:27.688]  I mean, he wrote it in public letters.
[00:25:28.488 --> 00:25:29.949]  It's part of the Library of Congress.
[00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.250]  I see, I see.
[00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:41.998]  Well, um, you see, the thing is, he was a Freemason, as was half the Founding Fathers, so they were a part of the secret society.
[00:25:42.038 --> 00:25:44.580]  Well, have you read what George Washington wrote about this?
[00:25:45.251 --> 00:25:45.932]  No, I haven't.
[00:25:46.172 --> 00:25:58.841]  Okay, well, the Masons were a construction guild, because mathematics and architecture technologies were more valuable than rubies and diamonds and gold, and so it had to be hidden.
[00:25:59.221 --> 00:26:11.390]  And then, because it was secret, it was perfect to set up an Illuminati intelligence agency, because it was already secret, and around that time it was being infiltrated, and George Washington and many others wrote about this.
[00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:15.211]  So all of the masons who were founding fathers weren't bad.
[00:26:15.631 --> 00:26:24.614]  Many of them just joined it because they were part of other fraternal orders and you had to join it to move up into the ranks of government under the British crown.
[00:26:25.194 --> 00:26:27.855]  But were they still members after the revolution?
[00:26:27.935 --> 00:26:30.236]  Yes, they were still members.
[00:26:30.376 --> 00:26:33.037]  Some of them quit later and also wrote about it.
[00:26:33.897 --> 00:26:35.938]  I see, because I thought that was the British
[00:26:36.876 --> 00:26:51.905]  No, the Masons go back to Solomon and the design of the temple and even before that to Egypt and the universities of mathematics and pyramid building.
[00:26:52.545 --> 00:26:55.607]  I knew the Illuminati was Egyptian because of that pyramid symbol.
[00:26:56.127 --> 00:27:01.350]  Well, they use that because it's the symbol of the command and control system.
[00:27:01.849 --> 00:27:02.850]  Yeah, I see.
[00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.831]  So they weren't part of the conspiracy themselves?
[00:27:06.372 --> 00:27:06.952]  Some were.
[00:27:07.132 --> 00:27:08.893]  Benjamin Franklin was a British agent.
[00:27:08.933 --> 00:27:09.633]  That's now admitted.
[00:27:10.694 --> 00:27:11.855]  He was a British spy?
[00:27:12.175 --> 00:27:12.415]  Yes.
[00:27:12.475 --> 00:27:14.636]  He died in England, lived in England, moved to England.
[00:27:15.777 --> 00:27:16.557]  Thank you for the call.
[00:27:16.657 --> 00:27:18.518]  I'm glad I could try to answer your questions, Jonathan.
[00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:20.259]  Steve in Ohio.
[00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:20.980]  Steve, go ahead.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:21.580]  You're on the air.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.821]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:27:23.981 --> 00:27:24.221]  Good.
[00:27:24.582 --> 00:27:25.862]  I have something to tell you.
[00:27:25.882 --> 00:27:28.144]  You have not talked about one subject.
[00:27:28.464 --> 00:27:30.125]  It's called DPL Broadcast.
[00:27:31.284 --> 00:27:32.565]  Broadband over power lines?
[00:27:32.645 --> 00:27:33.586]  I've talked about it quite a bit.
[00:27:33.606 --> 00:27:34.386]  We've had some guests on.
[00:27:34.667 --> 00:27:45.895]  Okay, I wanted to say, I heard it on RTL the other day, and I'm not a big fan of his, but it was so interesting because what basically it's going to do is it's going to totally block shortwave transmissions.
[00:27:46.543 --> 00:27:56.466]  And any type of communication... Not just that, it's going to hurt police radios, it's going to mess up EMS, it's going to... And this isn't a conspiracy, this is on the... No, it's all real.
[00:27:56.666 --> 00:28:06.850]  This is on the Federal Communications Commission's website, on the major broadcasters, even Clear Channel's upset about this because it'll block out AM reception.
[00:28:07.871 --> 00:28:11.313]  Uh, it has a shorter wave, it's just a higher band of short wave.
[00:28:11.593 --> 00:28:14.955]  Well, my question is though... Well, for those that don't know, let's tell them what it is.
[00:28:15.716 --> 00:28:28.343]  It's where they use power lines to transmit data instead of phone lines, and power lines already broadcast waves, but now by adding these communications it's going to bleed over and it already is during testing.
[00:28:28.363 --> 00:28:28.683]  Go ahead.
[00:28:29.103 --> 00:28:33.526]  Okay, and also I wanted to state that there were a lot of people that called in our building, and I give them credit because
[00:28:33.939 --> 00:28:36.765]  They didn't just want to buy that it's going to block out radio transmission.
[00:28:36.825 --> 00:28:37.827]  Some of them were even going...
[00:28:38.981 --> 00:28:45.105]  One of the things they talked about is that if you have a refrigerator, it's going to be able to monitor every little thing you do in your house.
[00:28:45.225 --> 00:28:47.787]  Well, again, that's not a conspiracy theory.
[00:28:48.287 --> 00:28:56.533]  They already use this down the power lines here in Austin, about a third of the houses, I'm told, to monitor your power usage.
[00:28:56.713 --> 00:28:56.913]  Right.
[00:28:57.394 --> 00:29:07.841]  Also, the RFID Big Consortium, the Radio Frequency Identification Tag Promoters, are saying they're going to use these to read and scan the small chips going into thousands of products.
[00:29:08.081 --> 00:29:14.163]  Well, right, because once you have like a $10 clock radio that hooks up to your power lines, it's going to have that chip.
[00:29:14.183 --> 00:29:15.303]  They're going to know what you listen to.
[00:29:15.343 --> 00:29:16.264]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:29:16.284 --> 00:29:16.824]  Well, that's it.
[00:29:17.524 --> 00:29:20.585]  The product has to have the chip to be interfaced with it.
[00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:23.806]  It can't just plug into your water heater and watch you through the water heater.
[00:29:24.086 --> 00:29:27.547]  It has to be through your digital cable box, through your high-definition TV.
[00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:28.027]  Yes.
[00:29:28.367 --> 00:29:28.588]  Right.
[00:29:28.648 --> 00:29:28.908]  Okay.
[00:29:28.928 --> 00:29:29.948]  Well, thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:29:30.473 --> 00:29:31.513]  Very, very good points.
[00:29:31.553 --> 00:29:33.434]  I'm glad you brought this up, Steve.
[00:29:33.454 --> 00:29:35.855]  I just wanted to give folks some background on what you were bringing up.
[00:29:36.555 --> 00:29:40.417]  Vince and others, your calls are up next when we get back at 800-259-9231.
[00:29:40.437 --> 00:29:47.079]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:49.000]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.781 --> 00:29:52.681]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.161 --> 00:29:54.782]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.702 --> 00:29:58.363]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.778 --> 00:30:09.283]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:30:09.563 --> 00:30:20.491]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:30:20.751 --> 00:30:22.553]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:30:22.833 --> 00:30:26.136]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:30:26.476 --> 00:30:36.925]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:30:37.225 --> 00:30:37.726]  That's right!
[00:30:37.906 --> 00:30:45.031]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:49.454]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:53.917]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:54.117 --> 00:30:54.578]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:02.546 --> 00:31:07.067]  All across America, people are using the sun and wind to create enough energy to power their homes.
[00:31:07.847 --> 00:31:12.589]  For over 18 years, these people have trusted Sunelco to help them on the road to energy independence.
[00:31:13.309 --> 00:31:15.969]  Sunelco has systems to meet every need and budget.
[00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:20.891]  Complete home systems using solar, wind, hydroelectric, or hydrogen fuel cells.
[00:31:21.411 --> 00:31:25.972]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[00:31:26.511 --> 00:31:30.934]  Many states offer cash rebates and tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[00:31:31.394 --> 00:31:31.835]  It's easy!
[00:31:32.295 --> 00:31:36.278]  Many of Sunelco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.
[00:31:36.658 --> 00:31:46.925]  Sunelco has a 106-page Renewable Energy Planning Guide and Catalog available for only $5 containing a detailed study to help anyone understand the how and why of renewable energy.
[00:31:47.265 --> 00:31:49.406]  It may just be the best investment you've ever made.
[00:31:49.867 --> 00:31:51.408]  Call Sunelco today at 1-800-338-6844.
[00:31:54.921 --> 00:31:57.109]  That's 800-338-6844 or visit them online at Sinelco.com
[00:32:02.262 --> 00:32:03.242]  It's finally here!
[00:32:03.383 --> 00:32:04.363]  Spring has arrived!
[00:32:04.563 --> 00:32:07.524]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:32:07.744 --> 00:32:11.186]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:32:11.406 --> 00:32:19.549]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:32:19.829 --> 00:32:23.551]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:32:23.771 --> 00:32:28.773]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:32:29.073 --> 00:32:33.577]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[00:32:33.757 --> 00:32:37.821]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[00:32:37.921 --> 00:32:45.047]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!
[00:32:45.327 --> 00:32:45.908]  Save money.
[00:32:46.128 --> 00:32:46.688]  Eat healthy.
[00:32:46.868 --> 00:32:50.812]  Grow your own delicious, secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[00:32:51.012 --> 00:32:52.893]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[00:32:52.913 --> 00:32:54.435]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[00:33:11.996 --> 00:33:16.759]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:18.379]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:33:18.399 --> 00:33:23.462]  We're going to go back to your calls here in a few minutes at 800-259-9231.
[00:33:23.482 --> 00:33:32.126]  And then I want to get back into this new push for more Patriot Act legislation.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.882]  And again, they just want to pass laws for things they admit they've already implemented.
[00:33:38.743 --> 00:33:56.632]  Now, that's massive crime being committed right out in front of your face, but they say, well, we have the executive power to do this domestically and turn the CIA loose on you and secretly arrest you, secretly kill you, make you work as an informant for us with no pay, and you can't ever tell anyone that you worked for us as a slave.
[00:33:56.652 --> 00:33:58.253]  I mean, that's already happening.
[00:33:59.855 --> 00:34:03.677]  And it's for every suspicion of a misdemeanor is an act of terrorism.
[00:34:04.318 --> 00:34:09.041]  You are treated as a convicted terrorist if you are suspected of committing any misdemeanor.
[00:34:09.141 --> 00:34:15.685]  Now that's already happening, and they admit that here in this Knight Ridder News story, but say now they want to pass the law to do this.
[00:34:17.286 --> 00:34:18.066]  It's incredible!
[00:34:18.707 --> 00:34:20.548]  They're the terrorists, my friends!
[00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:28.353]  Destroying our freedoms, saying terrorists are going to get us, we don't give our freedoms up, we don't do what they say, that's the definition of real terrorism.
[00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:42.741]  Putting a gun to someone's head or threatening to bomb them if they, quote, don't do what they're ordered to do, or, oh, I'm going to burn down your grocery store, the mobster says, if you don't pay this guy or pay me to protect you from this guy.
[00:34:43.262 --> 00:34:44.082]  It's extortion!
[00:34:46.464 --> 00:34:49.067]  It's a giant net to catch you all in their system.
[00:34:49.107 --> 00:34:51.328]  The good news is people are waking up.
[00:34:52.229 --> 00:34:54.751]  And then, of course, as I mentioned, let me go ahead and get into this now.
[00:34:56.332 --> 00:34:56.712]  Because U.S.
[00:34:57.153 --> 00:35:02.396]  nearing deal on way to track foreign visitors, the headline is Virtual Borders.
[00:35:03.256 --> 00:35:10.181]  Let's get into that, but even before I cover those stories, this is out of Asia Times.
[00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:21.728]  Now before I cover this, let me just give you in a nutshell, a thumbnail, a basic overview or recap of the Nick Berg situation.
[00:35:21.848 --> 00:35:23.869]  Classic intelligent agent M.O.
[00:35:24.993 --> 00:35:29.198]  He's in an Ivy League school, almost a perfect grade point average.
[00:35:29.238 --> 00:35:36.265]  He drops out suddenly and starts traveling the world with a bag of high-tech tricks, helping people.
[00:35:38.110 --> 00:36:05.269]  And his dad is in business with him, even though they supposedly politically disagree, and he's off tromping about doing this, and then he ends up working with this shady Iraqi who works for the State Department, who's been busted shipping out crack vials, and involved in all these other types of smuggling, and connected to the Russian mafia, and to the mafia out of Israel.
[00:36:05.409 --> 00:36:06.370]  I mean, this is in the news.
[00:36:07.936 --> 00:36:13.538]  All of this swirling around, then he works at Abu Ghraib prison, site of much of the torture you've heard about.
[00:36:13.718 --> 00:36:17.860]  There's 32 camps in Iraq, and reports are coming out it's far worse than the other camps.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:23.002]  Of course, they focus in on the lesser evils, on how the others can be worse.
[00:36:23.422 --> 00:36:24.783]  Raping women is pretty bad, folks.
[00:36:25.103 --> 00:36:26.203]  Beating people to death is pretty bad.
[00:36:26.403 --> 00:36:27.584]  He worked at that prison.
[00:36:28.304 --> 00:36:42.610]  And then, of course, the biggest piece of evidence, CBS News, MSNBC, he didn't just give passwords to one hijacker down in Oklahoma, now he's involved with two, but just accidentally gave him his computer and password, no big deal.
[00:36:43.331 --> 00:36:48.753]  And then he gets held by coalition authorities, that's confirmed, and then suddenly gets released within hours.
[00:36:49.994 --> 00:37:00.301]  This person that works for the State Department, this shady Iraqi, says that he disappears and then suddenly we find him in this video getting his head supposedly chopped off.
[00:37:01.182 --> 00:37:02.843]  And then here's the Asia Times.
[00:37:03.023 --> 00:37:04.104]  Berg beheading.
[00:37:04.524 --> 00:37:06.486]  No way, say medical experts.
[00:37:07.319 --> 00:37:12.203]  American businessman Nicholas Berg's body was found on May 8th near a Baghdad overpass.
[00:37:12.283 --> 00:37:23.492]  A video of his supposed decapitation death by knife appeared on the alleged Al-Qaeda linked website which uploads from London, England, where other government videos get uploaded, on May 11th.
[00:37:23.512 --> 00:37:33.980]  But according to what both a leading surgical authority and a noted forensic death expert separately told Asia Times, there's been about 50 of these reports now of different doctors, the video
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.663]  Depicting the decapitation appears to have been staged.
[00:37:37.763 --> 00:37:42.887]  Quote, I certainly would need to be convinced that the decapitation video was authentic.
[00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:58.681]  Dr. John Simpson, Executive Director for Surgical Affairs at the Royal Australian College of Surgeons, sent from New Zealand, echoing Dr. Simpson's criticism with this journalist as forensic death expert, John Norbley, PhD and a fellow of the American Board of
[00:38:00.915 --> 00:38:11.418]  Death investigations, whether he believed that bird decapitation video had been staged, nor be replied, yes, I think that was the best explanation of it.
[00:38:12.178 --> 00:38:14.259]  Now, I told you I've been in a slaughterhouse, folks.
[00:38:15.199 --> 00:38:23.581]  I, you know, I have shot a deer, 30, 45 minutes later gutted it, when the blood's already coagulated, you cut that head off, blood just pours out.
[00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:25.582]  Like gallons of syrup.
[00:38:26.992 --> 00:38:27.973]  And something's alive.
[00:38:28.013 --> 00:38:29.335]  He cut a large mammal's head off.
[00:38:29.375 --> 00:38:30.617]  Blood shoots 10-15 feet.
[00:38:31.058 --> 00:38:42.494]  Questions of when the video footage was taken and the time elapsed between the shooting of the video segments were raised by both experts reflecting a portion of the broader and ongoing video controversy.
[00:38:43.337 --> 00:38:56.965]  And it says, Nordby speaking to Asia Times online from Washington State noted, we don't know how much time wasn't filmed, adding that there's no way of knowing whether footage is contemporaneous with the footage that follows.
[00:38:56.985 --> 00:38:59.806]  That's because the audio is off and there's this western voice.
[00:38:59.826 --> 00:39:00.887]  I mean, everybody can see this.
[00:39:01.522 --> 00:39:07.764]  Well, the circumstances surrounding both the video and Nick Berg's last days have been the source of substantive speculation.
[00:39:08.124 --> 00:39:15.986]  Both Simpson and Nordby perceived it as high probable that Berg had died sometime prior to his decapitation.
[00:39:16.346 --> 00:39:23.828]  A factor in this was an apparent lack of the massive arterial bleeding such as these acts indicate.
[00:39:23.969 --> 00:39:28.810]  I would have thought that all the people in the vicinity would have been covered in blood in a matter of seconds.
[00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.511]  The doctor said, continuing, it was genuine.
[00:39:31.672 --> 00:39:37.595]  If it was genuine, said Simpson, notably, that the axe perpetrators appeared far from bloody.
[00:39:38.315 --> 00:39:39.136]  Far from so.
[00:39:39.516 --> 00:39:46.140]  And separately, normally observed, I think that by the time they're on his head, he's already dead.
[00:39:47.701 --> 00:39:55.705]  Providing another basis for the findings in the course of such an assault, an individual's automatic nervous system would react, typically doing so strongly.
[00:39:56.146 --> 00:39:58.247]  Again, somebody starts sawing your head off.
[00:39:58.869 --> 00:40:05.572]  You gain superhuman strength, my friends, and begin flopping around violently.
[00:40:06.172 --> 00:40:09.213]  I mean, you ever been in a car wreck, been stuck in a car?
[00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.134]  I guess you haven't been.
[00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:15.976]  You can suddenly just ram through, you know, the dashboard, rip the door open.
[00:40:15.996 --> 00:40:16.697]  At least I did.
[00:40:18.292 --> 00:40:20.414]  You know, old ladies picking cars off infants.
[00:40:20.494 --> 00:40:22.235]  I mean, somebody starts sawing your head off.
[00:40:22.575 --> 00:40:23.376]  He just lays there.
[00:40:23.977 --> 00:40:25.638]  Oh, well, he's hog-tied.
[00:40:26.078 --> 00:40:27.059]  Have somebody hog-tie you.
[00:40:27.499 --> 00:40:31.242]  You can flop around, you know, in many cases even begin to stand up.
[00:40:32.022 --> 00:40:34.765]  But he just lays there while they're sawing his head off.
[00:40:36.286 --> 00:40:42.330]  A lot of people get really injured because you get your hand stuck in a piece of machinery and people will just rip their hand and fingers right out of the machinery.
[00:40:43.171 --> 00:40:44.632]  That's the instinctive response.
[00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:48.579]  I'm providing another basis for their findings in the course of such an assault.
[00:40:48.599 --> 00:40:49.840]  This is everything I said, folks.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.761]  It's just common sense.
[00:40:51.102 --> 00:40:56.847]  An individual's automatic nervous system will react, typically doing so strongly, with the body shaking and jerking accordingly.
[00:40:57.348 --> 00:41:00.551]  And even after you die, that happens.
[00:41:01.051 --> 00:41:07.718]  And it says, Nordby noted that they rotated and moved his head, shifting vertebrae that should have been
[00:41:09.551 --> 00:41:10.972]  Initiated such action.
[00:41:11.032 --> 00:41:15.796]  Simpson said he certainly didn't perceive any movements at all in response to such efforts.
[00:41:16.217 --> 00:41:28.387]  During the period when Berg's captors filmed the decapitation sequence, circumstances indicate that he had already been dead a quite uncertain length of time, but more than however long the beheading took.
[00:41:29.275 --> 00:41:43.181]  Simpson stated both Simpson and Nordby also noted the difficulty in providing analysis based on the video, the inherent limitations presented by this, but both also felt that Berg had seemed drugged.
[00:41:43.641 --> 00:41:51.765]  A particularly significant point in the video sequence occurred as Berg's captors attacked him, bringing the supposedly fatal knife to bear.
[00:41:52.426 --> 00:41:54.167]  The way that they pulled him over.
[00:41:54.187 --> 00:41:57.550]  They could have used a dummy at that point.
[00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:13.842]  Reflecting Simpson regarded that the video portrayed separately, Nordby said Berg does not appear to register any sort of surprise or any change in his facial expression when he's grabbed and twisted over and they start to bring the weapon into use.
[00:42:13.922 --> 00:42:20.747]  Subsequently, Nordby said it was likely that the filming sequence was manipulated at the point immediately preceding this
[00:42:21.107 --> 00:42:37.733]  According to allowing Berg's corpse to be used for the decapitation sequence, Norby also emphasized that the video raises more questions than it answers, with the most fundamental questions of who are you and how do you die being impossible to answer from it.
[00:42:38.153 --> 00:42:46.296]  But broad speculation exists regarding a number of factors surrounding both Berg's death and the video and its timing in regard to revelations of U.S.
[00:42:46.357 --> 00:42:47.357]  prison atrocities.
[00:42:48.621 --> 00:42:49.922]  And I'll get to the rest later.
[00:42:49.962 --> 00:42:52.182]  It gets really, really serious from then on out.
[00:42:52.262 --> 00:42:54.223]  I want to take a few calls and get back into news.
[00:42:54.283 --> 00:42:58.045]  But this whole case is just like 9-11.
[00:42:58.325 --> 00:43:03.767]  I mean, in 9-11, they destroyed the evidence of the buildings.
[00:43:03.827 --> 00:43:04.667]  They hauled it off.
[00:43:04.727 --> 00:43:09.009]  They kicked the police, the firefighters out, who howled that it was a cover-up.
[00:43:10.383 --> 00:43:17.586]  You've got the supposed hijackers of all this FBI and CIA and MI6 and Mossad and Russian connections.
[00:43:17.646 --> 00:43:24.530]  I mean, you couldn't have more intelligence connections being trained at bases and having their houses and cars and credit cards paid for by the government.
[00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:25.930]  That's all public, by the way!
[00:43:26.951 --> 00:43:28.892]  You've got the NORAD standing down.
[00:43:28.932 --> 00:43:35.195]  You've got just hundreds of points, public officials, joint chiefs of staff, mayors, people being told not to fly.
[00:43:35.235 --> 00:43:35.915]  It goes on and on.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:44.186]  And you've got no evidence that Al-Qaeda really did this, but it's just held out day one that Al-Qaeda did it.
[00:43:45.347 --> 00:43:46.808]  And it's the same thing with this video.
[00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:51.052]  I mean, the people involved have all these intelligence agency connections.
[00:43:52.033 --> 00:43:53.955]  You can't even tell who it is on the video.
[00:43:54.656 --> 00:43:56.057]  It's shoddily done.
[00:43:56.077 --> 00:43:59.260]  If it is even a person whose head they're cutting off,
[00:44:00.261 --> 00:44:04.924]  Uh, and not a sophisticated mannequin, which are so realistic nowadays, you can only tell the difference.
[00:44:05.224 --> 00:44:08.847]  Not some Hollywood prop, like the turkey Bush brought over there at Thanksgiving.
[00:44:08.867 --> 00:44:11.368]  Uh, you know, the big fake turkey or whatever.
[00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:14.690]  I mean, it's just, it's theater, people!
[00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.071]  We don't even know what to believe!
[00:44:16.211 --> 00:44:22.155]  We just know their story is a complete fraud and stinks to high heaven!
[00:44:24.295 --> 00:44:27.058]  So it's the same MO with 9-11.
[00:44:27.139 --> 00:44:31.984]  We know their story is impossible from a hundred different angles.
[00:44:34.547 --> 00:44:35.268]  We know that.
[00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.233]  It's like the Fat Bin Laden in the dark room.
[00:44:39.253 --> 00:44:41.475]  Remember two years ago, the Fat Bin Laden saying, I carried out 9-11?
[00:44:42.677 --> 00:44:46.560]  And they ran the video through face print analysis.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.460]  It wasn't him.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.182]  It wasn't the same bone structure.
[00:44:49.362 --> 00:44:54.045]  It was a guy that weighed at least 50 pounds more, had a nose twice the size.
[00:44:54.645 --> 00:44:58.568]  They ran Bin Laden's real voice through a voice print, then tried to run the other one through.
[00:44:58.588 --> 00:45:00.569]  It didn't just fail.
[00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:02.731]  It wasn't even the same dialect.
[00:45:02.751 --> 00:45:04.192]  And these weren't Arabs saying it.
[00:45:04.472 --> 00:45:07.194]  It was major Western companies that study this.
[00:45:07.794 --> 00:45:10.216]  And the government quietly said, OK, it's not Bin Laden, it's a fake.
[00:45:10.516 --> 00:45:11.597]  That was in the back of the paper.
[00:45:11.757 --> 00:45:13.839]  We never talk about who gave us this fake!
[00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:16.861]  We have a government that gives us fake Bin Laden videos!
[00:45:17.461 --> 00:45:28.389]  That plants fake weapons dossiers, that lies about mobile weapons trucks, that lies about uranium from Nigeria and Africa to Saddam, that plants fake letters from troops in newspapers.
[00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:34.054]  We have a Pentagon two years ago that told us we formed the Pentagon Office of Strategic Information.
[00:45:34.254 --> 00:45:36.916]  We're going to lie to you and plant false media reports.
[00:45:38.067 --> 00:45:40.469]  So when they get caught doing it later, they go, well, we told you!
[00:45:40.489 --> 00:45:41.910]  I mean, this is incredible!
[00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.871]  They tell you they're going to lie to you!
[00:45:44.331 --> 00:46:04.265]  We catch them lying to us in every fashion imaginable, and then people still tell us we're conspiracy theorists, as we read the equivalent of the Asian Associated Press, highly respected, manned by British writers, Rick Goldstein's the author, and, oh, people still can't believe this.
[00:46:05.071 --> 00:46:07.772]  YOU CUT SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF, BLOOD SPRAYS!
[00:46:11.552 --> 00:46:13.333]  Do I have to explain this to people?
[00:46:13.433 --> 00:46:15.093]  I mean, is this hard to figure out?
[00:46:16.113 --> 00:46:16.233]  Ugh.
[00:46:18.414 --> 00:46:18.514]  Ugh.
[00:46:20.374 --> 00:46:21.494]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[00:46:21.534 --> 00:46:22.675]  And I got all this other news.
[00:46:22.735 --> 00:46:24.255]  It's just so much of it.
[00:46:24.275 --> 00:46:25.875]  These virtual borders, the rest of it.
[00:46:26.255 --> 00:46:27.155]  Vince in Indiana.
[00:46:27.175 --> 00:46:27.916]  Vince, go ahead.
[00:46:28.696 --> 00:46:29.396]  Hello, Alex.
[00:46:29.416 --> 00:46:30.156]  How are you today?
[00:46:30.176 --> 00:46:30.676]  Fine, sir.
[00:46:31.416 --> 00:46:34.777]  Listen, um, when you talk about expanding police powers,
[00:46:35.782 --> 00:46:40.743]  We've seen this right here in Indianapolis, Indiana around the various road construction projects.
[00:46:41.983 --> 00:46:49.084]  And they're putting these signs up now that are banning pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
[00:46:49.564 --> 00:46:55.685]  And it's a thousand feet all the way around the perimeter of the supposed construction site.
[00:46:56.946 --> 00:46:58.186]  Now, this is on highways?
[00:46:58.786 --> 00:47:02.207]  Highways and local roadways and sidewalks.
[00:47:02.807 --> 00:47:04.547]  Well, sir, I have to be honest with you.
[00:47:06.328 --> 00:47:08.170]  Let me just stop you.
[00:47:08.751 --> 00:47:14.297]  We have them grabbing citizens secretly, taking them to camps, beating people to death.
[00:47:14.978 --> 00:47:16.820]  We have face scanning cameras going up.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.700]  I have to be honest with you.
[00:47:17.741 --> 00:47:25.249]  Your example of them saying you can't be a pedestrian or that you can't be on a bike
[00:47:25.908 --> 00:47:34.450]  In their construction zone, a highway, they're doing that because that's the most dangerous place you can be under the age of 55.
[00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:36.271]  Your car is the most dangerous, number one.
[00:47:36.571 --> 00:47:37.991]  After that, it's heart attacks and cancer.
[00:47:38.412 --> 00:47:43.313]  But on top of it, of the road, the most dangerous thing is the construction site.
[00:47:43.613 --> 00:47:51.115]  Now, if they're doing this in downtown, or they're saying you can't have any pedestrian traffic anywhere a thousand feet near this, that sounds ridiculous.
[00:47:51.475 --> 00:48:11.440]  But overall, I can see saying you can't, you know, I mean, look, these nutty bicyclers, and I'm a bicycler myself, but these nutty bicyclers, when they have a giant shoulder, will get out in the highway, I mean a highway where you're supposed to drive 65 here in Austin, they will get out in the lane
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.622]  Wanting to be run over, and they're crazy!
[00:48:14.882 --> 00:48:15.463]  But go ahead.
[00:48:16.384 --> 00:48:22.528]  No, what I'm saying is that they've gone beyond what they're doing in the construction zone.
[00:48:23.009 --> 00:48:25.571]  It's past the construction zone.
[00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:27.913]  Yeah, they do that to raise fines, too.
[00:48:27.953 --> 00:48:31.395]  You know, oh, half the highway is now a construction zone, even though there's no construction.
[00:48:31.596 --> 00:48:35.619]  Because if you now don't drive 55 where it was 70, we get to double the fine.
[00:48:36.359 --> 00:48:38.161]  Yeah, and the other thing is,
[00:48:39.344 --> 00:48:42.606]  I've always, I've been always active in our neighborhood groups here.
[00:48:43.387 --> 00:48:52.633]  But I have always told people, do not put your name on a list of paper and turn it over to the authorities because they will come back.
[00:48:53.874 --> 00:48:55.355]  I don't understand what you're talking about.
[00:48:55.815 --> 00:48:56.355]  You understand?
[00:48:56.375 --> 00:48:59.457]  Because we tried to... I don't even know what you're talking about.
[00:48:59.477 --> 00:49:00.438]  Okay.
[00:49:00.918 --> 00:49:04.220]  We were fighting against a license renewal for a liquor store.
[00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:08.003]  I believe in the freedom to drink, do whatever you want, and blow your
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.181]  Drinking your brains, or whatever.
[00:49:11.821 --> 00:49:20.923]  But, this place, you know, we have children, those guys, you know, urinating... Okay, how does that tie in, sir, to what you just said?
[00:49:20.983 --> 00:49:23.283]  You're saying, don't sign petitions?
[00:49:24.284 --> 00:49:28.705]  Don't sign petitions, because... Okay, let me... Listen, I appreciate the call, Vince, but listen.
[00:49:30.405 --> 00:49:32.465]  Put me down there as John Hancock.
[00:49:32.725 --> 00:49:34.926]  Put my name real big on there.
[00:49:36.082 --> 00:49:37.523]  I mean, we need to be out in the open.
[00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:38.464]  We're the good guys.
[00:49:38.504 --> 00:49:39.284]  We have the power.
[00:49:39.304 --> 00:49:40.625]  We've got to stop living in fear.
[00:49:40.905 --> 00:49:42.086]  We've got to be out in the open.
[00:49:42.106 --> 00:49:43.507]  There's more of us than there are of them.
[00:49:44.047 --> 00:49:47.009]  And if we keep creeping around like we've done something wrong, it's only going to get worse.
[00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:50.731]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in Connecticut.
[00:49:50.771 --> 00:49:51.451]  Eric, go ahead.
[00:49:51.712 --> 00:49:53.032]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:49:53.152 --> 00:49:53.453]  You bet.
[00:49:53.713 --> 00:49:54.933]  I have a question and a comment.
[00:49:55.294 --> 00:49:58.476]  Are you still on WARL in Rhode Island, Providence?
[00:49:59.556 --> 00:50:00.917]  At least we were last week, yeah.
[00:50:01.277 --> 00:50:01.537]  Okay.
[00:50:02.078 --> 00:50:02.318]  Alright.
[00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:06.314]  I talked to a buddy of mine and he said he couldn't get you, but maybe he had the wrong frequency.
[00:50:07.335 --> 00:50:09.598]  Alex, um, let me get this straight.
[00:50:09.978 --> 00:50:13.242]  This Serpent Rumsfeld and his Neocon ilk...
[00:50:13.618 --> 00:50:17.960]  Can watch us from morning through night with cameras, microphones, microchips.
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.442]  Everything they do has got to be secret and no investigation.
[00:50:21.782 --> 00:50:22.743]  National security.
[00:50:23.023 --> 00:50:29.746]  So what if the entire Defense Department is their private trillion dollar cash machine while they're in office going directly into their bank accounts?
[00:50:29.986 --> 00:50:31.067]  You just shut up about it!
[00:50:31.567 --> 00:50:32.608]  But I guess I'm a...
[00:50:35.189 --> 00:50:35.890]  Al-Qaeda agent.
[00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.051]  Tell you what, stay there Eric, I'll let you finish up.
[00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:43.515]  Yeah, if you're against Al-Qaeda, if you fight the New World Order, if you're against terrorism, you're Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:43.955 --> 00:50:49.359]  If you're a terrorist, you kill people, you steal money, you're a torture master, you're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:50.119 --> 00:50:52.101]  You have to learn how double-think works, okay?
[00:50:53.041 --> 00:50:54.803]  If you are Al-Qaeda, you're not Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:54.963 --> 00:50:56.644]  If you aren't Al-Qaeda, you are Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:57.064 --> 00:50:58.165]  We'll be right back, stay there.
[00:51:03.286 --> 00:51:03.627]  I think so.
[00:51:18.567 --> 00:51:19.168]  I think so.
[00:51:38.882 --> 00:51:39.242]  I think so.
[00:52:00.822 --> 00:52:02.322]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.523 --> 00:52:05.603]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:52:05.743 --> 00:52:09.605]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:52:09.685 --> 00:52:13.926]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:52:14.266 --> 00:52:18.027]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:52:18.107 --> 00:52:20.028]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:52:20.168 --> 00:52:23.489]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:52:23.529 --> 00:52:24.609]  The medical bills!
[00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:28.252]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:52:28.392 --> 00:52:31.435]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:34.497]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:52:34.958 --> 00:52:41.083]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:52:41.623 --> 00:52:45.405]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:52:45.805 --> 00:52:47.166]  Order your video today.
[00:52:47.566 --> 00:52:48.567]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:52:48.587 --> 00:52:50.628]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[00:52:59.992 --> 00:53:01.953]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:53:02.053 --> 00:53:12.757]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:53:13.137 --> 00:53:17.659]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:53:17.739 --> 00:53:29.063]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:53:29.663 --> 00:53:36.509]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:53:36.909 --> 00:53:39.051]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:53:39.531 --> 00:53:44.515]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[00:53:44.815 --> 00:53:50.940]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:53:51.761 --> 00:53:55.163]  I have a rule that if you disagree with me, you go to the front of the line.
[00:53:55.263 --> 00:53:56.023]  But that is Trump!
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:33.309]  By somebody on their own nickel from England, or Rome, or Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Venezuela, the places, Antarctica, McMurdle weather station, we've gotten calls from there.
[00:54:33.889 --> 00:54:37.252]  So that's Trump by calls from outside of the country.
[00:54:38.013 --> 00:54:41.535]  Unless it's from Canada, because most of them can call in on our nickel.
[00:54:42.396 --> 00:54:48.380]  So we're going to finish up with Eric, then we'll go to Mark in Rome, then Michael in Kentucky who disagrees, and Gary and others.
[00:54:49.241 --> 00:54:50.522]  Before I do that though,
[00:54:51.835 --> 00:54:55.236]  Again, I've made ten films that expose who the real murdering terrorists are.
[00:54:56.396 --> 00:55:02.597]  And these are info weapons, info bombs, in the info war that will wake people up big time.
[00:55:02.617 --> 00:55:07.458]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, which the New York Post says Michael Moore ripped off for his new film.
[00:55:07.979 --> 00:55:09.619]  I don't know, just get it, it's good.
[00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:14.200]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, part two of that, the masters of terror exposed.
[00:55:15.209 --> 00:55:18.713]  You can also get Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:55:19.473 --> 00:55:24.738]  You can get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, one of my newest videos, Matrix of Evil.
[00:55:25.199 --> 00:55:35.728]  Got a great video I carry that's from Jews Preservation of Firearms Ownership, Innocence Betrayed, covering the 180 million people killed after the government took their guns worldwide.
[00:55:36.209 --> 00:55:40.673]  Great new video, comes with three free comic books that give the history of gun control.
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:51.839]  My videos are $25.95 a piece, all over 2 hours, $20 if you order 3 or more of any of my 10 titles, and you're authorized to make copies of my videos, not of the other videos I carry.
[00:55:52.849 --> 00:56:07.636]  So please go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com, peruse the secure online shopping cart, make your order today, get the videos, start waking people up and support this broadcast, or call toll free to get the films, the books, the t-shirts, all of it, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:15.214 --> 00:56:28.097]  That's 888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:56:29.837 --> 00:56:34.158]  If you don't take action and expose those that are behind the terror, it's over.
[00:56:34.438 --> 00:56:35.958]  I mean, it's really up to us.
[00:56:36.058 --> 00:56:37.098]  You're the last line.
[00:56:37.138 --> 00:56:37.899]  Who's going to save you?
[00:56:38.239 --> 00:56:38.919]  Look in the mirror.
[00:56:39.439 --> 00:56:42.239]  God tells you to get up there and fight evil, and he'll give you the strength to do it.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:44.820]  But it's up to you, my friends.
[00:56:45.606 --> 00:56:48.109]  So, 1-888-253-3139 or 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:56:48.149 --> 00:56:48.850]  Let's go back to
[00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:00.572]  Eric in Connecticut, then we'll break and come back and talk to Mark and Michael and others.
[00:57:01.033 --> 00:57:01.733]  Eric, go ahead.
[00:57:01.953 --> 00:57:02.654]  Yeah, Alex, thanks.
[00:57:03.274 --> 00:57:06.257]  Yeah, he's doing all this, but camera phones are banned.
[00:57:06.297 --> 00:57:07.898]  I mean, what else is going on over there?
[00:57:07.938 --> 00:57:09.839]  My question is, what the heck else is going on over there?
[00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:17.785]  Well, Congress has got a discussion of banning or limiting camera phones here in America, so they're telling you, your camera's bad, our camera's good.
[00:57:17.945 --> 00:57:25.511]  Every week I see articles where police arrest people on city streets for videotaping them, but they want to cram a camera down our throats.
[00:57:26.471 --> 00:57:27.452]  Yeah, it's true tyranny.
[00:57:27.512 --> 00:57:32.299]  They've got cameras that show us our naked bodies going in the airports, but that's okay.
[00:57:32.319 --> 00:57:32.619]  Go ahead.
[00:57:32.639 --> 00:57:33.581]  You know what I say, Alex?
[00:57:33.701 --> 00:57:39.729]  Bust up the microphones, bash the cameras, fry the microchips, and start trying this filth for treason.
[00:57:40.413 --> 00:57:44.917]  Well, no, you see, the terrorists attacked us because they hated our freedom, so Bush is doing the right thing.
[00:57:44.957 --> 00:57:53.203]  He's destroying America and destroying our freedom, and then Al-Qaeda is going to leave us alone because Al-Qaeda is the military-industrial complex, and that's a true statement.
[00:57:53.223 --> 00:57:56.806]  They attacked us to get our freedoms, and it's really a true statement.
[00:57:57.046 --> 00:57:59.027]  It is, and it's a true double standard, Alex.
[00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:00.909]  I mean, everything for them and nothing for us.
[00:58:01.997 --> 00:58:03.898]  Well, you know, they're the rulers.
[00:58:03.938 --> 00:58:06.719]  They deserve to use the Pentagon as their private cash machine.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:07.620]  What's wrong with you?
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.021]  Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
[00:58:09.061 --> 00:58:10.341]  I'm not being a good neocon.
[00:58:10.481 --> 00:58:14.323]  Hey, what do you think about top doctors and scientists saying the Berg videos are fake?
[00:58:15.164 --> 00:58:16.785]  Oh, the evidence is there, Alex.
[00:58:17.225 --> 00:58:21.627]  There must be at least 30 points of reason as to why this thing is fake.
[00:58:21.687 --> 00:58:23.708]  I mean, the western voices in the background.
[00:58:24.108 --> 00:58:25.929]  Gold rings on fingers.
[00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:29.171]  A haphazardly tied headband.
[00:58:29.351 --> 00:58:30.912]  But we are meant to learn of it.
[00:58:31.485 --> 00:58:31.905]  That's right.
[00:58:32.385 --> 00:58:33.286]  Alright, thank you.
[00:58:34.166 --> 00:58:34.926]  Good to hear from you.
[00:58:35.106 --> 00:58:36.367]  Second hour only.
[00:58:37.387 --> 00:58:39.228]  Seventy seconds away after we get a break.
[00:58:40.489 --> 00:58:47.291]  And we will go straight to your calls and a plethora of cornucopia, a mountain of vital information.
[00:58:47.471 --> 00:58:48.512]  Stay tuned for transmission.
[00:58:53.345 --> 00:58:57.847]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:58:58.187 --> 00:59:02.289]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:03.130]  We listened.
[00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:08.432]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:59:08.692 --> 00:59:09.172]  We listened.
[00:59:09.553 --> 00:59:12.594]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:59:13.034 --> 00:59:13.574]  We listened.
[00:59:14.035 --> 00:59:17.056]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:59:19.294 --> 00:59:24.540]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:26.322]  Again, we listened.
[00:59:26.682 --> 00:59:34.050]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:37.593]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by
[00:59:43.928 --> 00:59:44.909]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:59:44.929 --> 00:59:46.491]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:58.001 --> 00:59:58.642]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.302 --> 01:00:00.363]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.083 --> 01:00:02.184]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.845 --> 01:00:03.665]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.406 --> 01:00:05.287]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.307 --> 01:00:09.750]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:14.294]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.975 --> 01:00:20.979]  Alright, already into hour number two of this Monday, the 24th of May, 2004 edition.
[01:00:21.079 --> 01:00:25.042]  We're gonna get into the fake Merg video, now mainstream news.
[01:00:26.944 --> 01:00:29.385]  Coming up with a new virtual border for all of us.
[01:00:29.405 --> 01:00:32.807]  The illegals come in, the citizens can't go out, basically is what it does.
[01:00:33.988 --> 01:00:38.770]  Also a lot of gas price news, a lot of Iraq news.
[01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:42.312]  Bush falling off his bicycle is another one of his seizures.
[01:00:43.352 --> 01:00:45.033]  It's all coming up in the next hour.
[01:00:45.113 --> 01:00:47.374]  Right now, let us go to the calls.
[01:00:47.434 --> 01:00:51.216]  Let's talk to Mark calling us from Rome, Italy.
[01:00:52.327 --> 01:00:53.308]  Actually, it's Rome, New York.
[01:00:53.328 --> 01:00:53.728]  I'll be honest.
[01:00:53.768 --> 01:00:56.650]  Okay, because I specifically asked her, I said, is it Rome?
[01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:58.931]  And she said, yes, it's Rome, Italy.
[01:00:59.431 --> 01:01:01.912]  So let's just say you're in Italy.
[01:01:02.653 --> 01:01:03.973]  How are things going over there?
[01:01:04.954 --> 01:01:09.536]  Probably even more of a debacle than it is here, but it's funny you thought it was Rome, Italy.
[01:01:10.457 --> 01:01:12.758]  I urge everyone to buy your videos, number one.
[01:01:12.778 --> 01:01:14.179]  Are you there?
[01:01:14.479 --> 01:01:14.739]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:17.520]  I urge everyone to buy your videos.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.201]  They're fantastic.
[01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:19.161]  Well, thank you.
[01:01:19.501 --> 01:01:20.762]  I want to ask you a question.
[01:01:22.005 --> 01:01:34.114]  Do you find there's any connection between the new mass, the new world, the new mass that they have in the Catholic Church and the new order, the new world order that's going on now?
[01:01:34.554 --> 01:01:47.084]  I'm not a Catholic, but a lot of upright, devout Catholics I know say that it is totally different and this is what's caused all the corruption and the horrible things going on in the Catholic Church.
[01:01:47.144 --> 01:01:49.906]  I mean, that's what Mel Gibson and others have said.
[01:01:51.559 --> 01:01:52.119]  And his father.
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.961]  But I know a lot of Catholics that have left the mainline Catholic Church.
[01:01:56.041 --> 01:02:04.304]  Yeah, there's a new, they call it a new order of the mass, which is so close to the New World Order, it's unbelievable.
[01:02:04.685 --> 01:02:09.066]  Well, they started changing the mass and the sacraments back in the 60's, didn't they?
[01:02:09.287 --> 01:02:12.328]  Yeah, for non-Catholics, you know a lot about it.
[01:02:13.228 --> 01:02:14.769]  Well, we study all these issues.
[01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:17.092]  I was just wondering if you did study the issue.
[01:02:17.132 --> 01:02:18.373]  Obviously, you've looked into it.
[01:02:18.673 --> 01:02:19.213]  Yes, I have.
[01:02:19.433 --> 01:02:20.594]  It was a question I had for you.
[01:02:20.614 --> 01:02:21.315]  Keep up the good work.
[01:02:21.675 --> 01:02:21.995]  You bet.
[01:02:22.015 --> 01:02:23.637]  I appreciate the call.
[01:02:24.477 --> 01:02:31.023]  Let's go ahead and talk now to a man who disagrees, joining us from Kentucky.
[01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:32.004]  Michael, go ahead.
[01:02:32.024 --> 01:02:35.687]  You really hit a sore spot with me, Alex.
[01:02:36.587 --> 01:02:39.109]  I'm an ally of yours.
[01:02:39.129 --> 01:02:41.892]  Well, it's okay if you disagree with me.
[01:02:41.912 --> 01:02:42.272]  Go ahead.
[01:02:43.938 --> 01:02:56.910]  What you said about the bicyclists there earlier, I know it wasn't an issue for the show today, but people in America need to have some, to put it politely, some charity for people on the roads.
[01:02:57.170 --> 01:03:07.519]  I heard you talking about cases where bicyclists are riding along the edge of the road and not when they've got a wide shoulder over there to ride on.
[01:03:10.408 --> 01:03:13.731]  There's been various states that have toyed with the idea.
[01:03:13.751 --> 01:03:20.397]  I think West Virginia did it a few years ago where they actually proposed allowing bicyclists to ride on limited access highways.
[01:03:20.917 --> 01:03:26.121]  But the problem you get into, and if you're a bicyclist you know this, there's just tons of debris over there.
[01:03:26.161 --> 01:03:28.924]  There's metal parts and bolts and pieces that fall off.
[01:03:28.964 --> 01:03:32.146]  There's rednecks that bust pop bottles on the side of the road.
[01:03:32.207 --> 01:03:38.532]  And unless you, even with Kevlar tires, which I've had this happen by the grace of God or whatever, I come home and I can see
[01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:40.190]  We're good to go.
[01:04:09.798 --> 01:04:24.368]  He was talking about these construction zones banning bikes because if there's no shoulder and it's a highway, and they get on the highways where people drive 80 miles an hour by the way, I just wouldn't do that because it's so scary and so dangerous.
[01:04:24.468 --> 01:04:25.749]  I'm not against bicyclists.
[01:04:25.769 --> 01:04:27.990]  I, you know, have a mountain bike and ride it when I have time.
[01:04:28.671 --> 01:04:31.232]  So I'm not here bashing cyclists.
[01:04:31.292 --> 01:04:33.134]  Well, that's not the way you put it, Connie.
[01:04:33.154 --> 01:04:34.615]  You said, I don't remember the answer.
[01:04:34.635 --> 01:04:35.095]  Well, they do.
[01:04:35.175 --> 01:04:38.337]  I mean, I mean, it's just, you'll be going down an interstate.
[01:04:38.357 --> 01:04:39.658]  Well, read your driver's manual.
[01:04:40.218 --> 01:04:44.661]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:44.721 --> 01:04:47.923]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.

[01:05:34.589 --> 01:05:39.970]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:08:01.149 --> 01:08:02.270]  Government cover-ups.

[01:08:04.492 --> 01:08:05.412]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:06.053 --> 01:08:09.975]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.235 --> 01:08:14.358]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:14.478 --> 01:08:17.380]  Big Brother.
[01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:19.382]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:19.502 --> 01:08:20.883]  Concentration camps.
[01:08:21.103 --> 01:08:21.643]  Torture.
[01:08:21.763 --> 01:08:22.584]  Secret arrests.
[01:08:23.673 --> 01:08:25.094]  And bicycles.
[01:08:25.214 --> 01:08:28.077]  Giving cars the right of way.
[01:08:28.797 --> 01:08:30.038]  Dun, dun, dun.
[01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:33.941]  One time I said that I don't like cats compared to dogs.
[01:08:33.981 --> 01:08:34.822]  I'm a dog person.
[01:08:34.862 --> 01:08:36.723]  I did get some hate mail.
[01:08:37.664 --> 01:08:38.364]  I have a cat.
[01:08:38.404 --> 01:08:39.225]  I pet it every day.
[01:08:39.285 --> 01:08:40.726]  I feed it every morning and night.
[01:08:41.547 --> 01:08:44.869]  Just compared to a dog, it's a pathetic creature.
[01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:47.111]  I'll get more hate mail for that one.
[01:08:47.151 --> 01:08:49.493]  But this is how we get people to disagree, I guess.
[01:08:50.223 --> 01:09:18.250]  No, what I'm saying is, is I go out and I ride my mountain bike, and I ride it, you know, in the parks and on the green belt when I have time, and in the past I've owned a 10-speed and I've ridden it around the city, but just for my own safety, because I know the drivers, some of them are idiots or not paying attention or answering their cell phone, I don't get out off the shoulder and say, hmm, let me see, this is a major interstate, people driving 80 miles an hour, running into cars, I mean, I won't get on a motorcycle, okay?
[01:09:19.356 --> 01:09:24.578]  I mean, I've ridden dirt bikes and stuff, but I will not get on a motorcycle and drive around.
[01:09:24.598 --> 01:09:26.458]  I mean, it's like playing Frogger.
[01:09:26.478 --> 01:09:28.659]  You know the game where the frog tries to jump past the cars?
[01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:30.459]  And so that's all I'm saying.
[01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:38.862]  And it is irritating where big, beautiful shoulders out in the country, you know, with a 65 mile an hour speed limit.
[01:09:39.867 --> 01:09:41.709]  Well, I'm not talking about just the highways.
[01:09:41.769 --> 01:09:42.289]  I'm talking about
[01:10:07.283 --> 01:10:19.474]  Uh, bypasses and things like that, where actually the government has granted local governments, uh, intermodal money, where they are supposed to put a bike lane, uh, on the side of the road.
[01:10:19.494 --> 01:10:21.776]  Yeah, they've done that in Austin, and we're going to end up like China.
[01:10:21.796 --> 01:10:22.797]  They're about to take our cars.
[01:10:22.857 --> 01:10:31.444]  Well, with the price of gas going up, and they're not going to let go of any of these hydrogen technologies, where you can make your own fuel at home or whatever.
[01:10:32.133 --> 01:10:54.920]  Then you're going to see, I think you're going to see more of this, and we're looking at an increasingly divided economy and divided social structure where you've got the big Humvees, everybody's got what they want, and then everybody else, just like in the movie Demolition Man, where, you know, you come down here and you live with Edgar Friendly at the lower end of the economic spectrum,
[01:10:55.649 --> 01:11:03.220]  And hope that people don't run over you when you're on your bicycle just trying to get back and forth to somewhere or for some fitness or whatever.
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.963]  Sir, you certainly agree that there are idiot drivers, right?
[01:11:06.624 --> 01:11:09.909]  Well, I've been hit by at least four or five of them.
[01:11:10.029 --> 01:11:12.132]  Are there then idiot bicycle riders?
[01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:18.835]  Uh, there are some, yeah, that run the red lights and act like they're a New York bicycle messenger or something.
[01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:19.435]  Exactly!
[01:11:19.495 --> 01:11:21.477]  That's the... I'll tell you what... Okay, well, let me clarify.
[01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:23.459]  That's who I'm talking about.
[01:11:23.699 --> 01:11:29.364]  I'll tell you what... The light turns green, the light turns green and ten bicycles come flying in front of me and I almost hit them.
[01:11:29.644 --> 01:11:34.428]  Now, look, I've never hit a bicycle, but sometimes it's hard to dodge these people.
[01:11:35.495 --> 01:11:43.242]  Well, if they're on a limited... I can understand if they're on a limited access highway, like an interstate highway, and they're taking up both lanes.
[01:11:43.282 --> 01:11:44.243]  That's pretty stupid.
[01:11:44.403 --> 01:11:45.163]  That's ridiculous.
[01:11:45.644 --> 01:11:53.691]  Unless you're talking about some kind of a major event, like the Ride Across or the America, where they actually ride from Los Angeles to Georgia.
[01:11:54.224 --> 01:11:57.347]  Or I forget the route, but they have escort vehicles to do that.
[01:11:57.487 --> 01:11:58.027]  Yeah, I understand.
[01:11:58.167 --> 01:12:02.711]  I mean, obviously this is an issue of some importance, but do you have any comments about the Berg video?
[01:12:02.811 --> 01:12:04.532]  Experts saying it's fake, top doctors.
[01:12:04.552 --> 01:12:07.875]  Do you have any comments about wanting to expand the Patriot Act or any of this?
[01:12:08.175 --> 01:12:09.096]  Well, yes.
[01:12:09.496 --> 01:12:11.438]  Hey, Bush fell off his bicycle this weekend.
[01:12:11.478 --> 01:12:21.646]  That's right, and I've been making fun of that myself a little bit on my own local broadcast, but now the way you put it, and you have a habit of this, Alex, when
[01:12:22.188 --> 01:12:23.449]  People call up with things.
[01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:31.392]  I think you need to watch yourself because you will make comments that will stir stuff up like this.
[01:12:31.412 --> 01:12:33.233]  This is ancillary to the issue.
[01:12:33.613 --> 01:12:40.577]  And what you said when you said that these loony bicyclists that ride when they've got this great big shoulder off the edge, that's what got me going.
[01:12:42.117 --> 01:12:43.398]  You said that, Michael.
[01:12:43.478 --> 01:12:44.218]  I appreciate the call.
[01:12:44.279 --> 01:12:45.139]  I appreciate your opinion.
[01:12:45.854 --> 01:12:49.675]  I was talking about the loony bicyclists, and there's loony car drivers.
[01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:52.575]  So don't have to take that as personally to you, Michael.
[01:12:53.195 --> 01:12:53.855]  I absolve it.
[01:12:54.015 --> 01:12:57.576]  It was not for you in Kentucky, you know, you particularly.
[01:12:58.376 --> 01:13:00.016]  You know who you are out there, though.
[01:13:00.096 --> 01:13:00.697]  Come on!
[01:13:00.717 --> 01:13:06.958]  Now, you need to get angry about the other stuff, but I guess you've been hit four times, I can... That's my point!
[01:13:06.978 --> 01:13:14.459]  These car drivers are so crazy, and half the time I'm one of them, that, I mean, I wouldn't get out there on the side of the highway on a bike.
[01:13:15.197 --> 01:13:15.878]  I'm sorry.
[01:13:15.898 --> 01:13:18.420]  I mean, it would scare me to death.
[01:13:20.301 --> 01:13:24.024]  My wife doesn't like getting on I-35 during peak times.
[01:13:24.324 --> 01:13:32.010]  People driving 80 miles an hour like nutcases, and you don't see a lot of them on I-35 anymore, but you see them on the access road too, and that's just as busy.
[01:13:33.781 --> 01:13:39.945]  Now folks, I really want to get back into the other news here, but Michael disagreed with me, and people always call in to disagree about stuff like that.
[01:13:40.285 --> 01:13:41.326]  You don't like cats?
[01:13:41.386 --> 01:13:42.367]  What's wrong with you?
[01:13:42.967 --> 01:13:43.808]  No, I own a cat.
[01:13:43.828 --> 01:13:44.488]  I'm nice to it.
[01:13:44.528 --> 01:13:44.989]  I pet it.
[01:13:45.729 --> 01:13:52.093]  It jumps up on my truck and scratches the hood up, which I don't even really particularly care about, but it's just an annoying creature.
[01:13:52.794 --> 01:13:54.315]  Let's go ahead and see.
[01:13:54.375 --> 01:13:55.236]  I've started it again.
[01:13:55.816 --> 01:13:56.336]  Come on, folks.
[01:13:56.396 --> 01:13:58.017]  We're not going to talk about your favorite color.
[01:13:58.057 --> 01:14:00.119]  We're not going to talk about... I'm not saying your call was that.
[01:14:00.956 --> 01:14:04.278]  But it's starting to border on that with where I'm going.
[01:14:05.078 --> 01:14:06.679]  So stop it to myself.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.781]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gary in Texas.
[01:14:09.801 --> 01:14:10.562]  Gary, go ahead.
[01:14:10.582 --> 01:14:13.903]  Hey, my favorite color is blue.
[01:14:14.324 --> 01:14:15.544]  No, not really, Alex.
[01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:17.566]  The reason I was calling you... But what shade of blue?
[01:14:19.907 --> 01:14:23.229]  Oh, let's just say I like sea foam blue.
[01:14:23.809 --> 01:14:25.290]  Hey, let's put him on hold for a second.
[01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:27.191]  Either he's on a speakerphone or something's going on.
[01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:28.612]  Turn your radio off.
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:32.481]  Turn your radios off, please!
[01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:34.501]  That's my, uh, courier radio.
[01:14:34.561 --> 01:14:35.482]  Okay, good, good.
[01:14:35.542 --> 01:14:36.262]  Go ahead.
[01:14:36.702 --> 01:14:37.862]  Yeah, I know.
[01:14:37.902 --> 01:14:38.983]  I've been in radio.
[01:14:39.743 --> 01:14:40.843]  That feedback is awful.
[01:14:40.883 --> 01:14:42.244]  Wow, lots of people in radio.
[01:14:42.264 --> 01:14:42.944]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:14:43.464 --> 01:14:44.664]  Okay, hey, here's the deal.
[01:14:45.124 --> 01:14:48.525]  I've been following you since 95, I believe.
[01:14:48.545 --> 01:14:52.947]  I think that's the first time I passed you up the hallway at, uh, uh, Access.
[01:14:53.847 --> 01:14:57.908]  And I remember talking about, you know, hey, this guy Alex Jones, he's got
[01:14:58.848 --> 01:14:59.269]  Yeah, I think.
[01:15:15.688 --> 01:15:17.528]  It was something to do with Keynesville.
[01:15:17.589 --> 01:15:20.689]  Remember they were doing the blackout helicopter thing?
[01:15:20.729 --> 01:15:22.610]  Well, yeah, it was the front page of the paper.
[01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:27.891]  Black helicopters are attacking, police chiefs throwing them out, buildings blowing up, automatic weapons fire.
[01:15:28.331 --> 01:15:33.452]  It's in the paper that it's happening, but then there's an article next to it that I'm a kook, because I talk about it.
[01:15:33.832 --> 01:15:37.373]  I know, and I was just like, I went to college there, so I called you that night.
[01:15:37.453 --> 01:15:40.993]  And I was like, hey, I know, that's the police station.
[01:15:41.033 --> 01:15:42.234]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:15:42.374 --> 01:15:44.234]  My little sisters were still there.
[01:15:44.696 --> 01:15:47.818]  In Kingsville, they're at Texas Tech in their grad degree now.
[01:15:48.539 --> 01:15:51.361]  And I was like, this guy's not a kook.
[01:15:51.902 --> 01:15:53.643]  It's simply people who are not
[01:15:54.104 --> 01:15:57.227]  You don't have the ability to turn to the page that you're on.
[01:15:57.267 --> 01:15:58.288]  Well, it's not even that.
[01:15:59.009 --> 01:16:04.054]  You can show them the page, and they'll say you're a kook because they think it's great.
[01:16:04.495 --> 01:16:07.218]  Or, look, people are still in denial about the draft.
[01:16:07.818 --> 01:16:09.080]  Senators are calling for it.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.681]  They're reforming draft boards.
[01:16:11.342 --> 01:16:16.888]  They've got 12 bills introduced last time I checked, and people still email me going, it's not true, it's not true.
[01:16:17.848 --> 01:16:18.608]  Oh yeah, I know.
[01:16:18.628 --> 01:16:23.490]  And that's because Bush isn't going to announce it himself until there's another terror attack.
[01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:25.531]  You know, it's like the Patriot Act, too.
[01:16:25.951 --> 01:16:29.192]  Six months after it's introduced, Ashcroft is saying it doesn't exist.
[01:16:29.593 --> 01:16:31.573]  And now they're saying, oh yeah, we have introduced it.
[01:16:31.593 --> 01:16:35.875]  So, I mean, how do you deal with this invincible ignorance?
[01:16:36.275 --> 01:16:40.457]  You know, a friend of mine actually got me into this.
[01:16:40.537 --> 01:16:42.517]  Rob, I won't say his last name.
[01:16:42.978 --> 01:16:45.279]  We're both from AMN, though, that ought to give you a clue.
[01:16:45.299 --> 01:16:45.679]  We were.
[01:16:46.681 --> 01:16:48.422]  It's been cut since the budget cut.
[01:16:49.283 --> 01:16:50.463]  Austin Music Network?
[01:16:50.903 --> 01:16:51.204]  Yeah.
[01:16:51.984 --> 01:16:59.048]  But Rob is like totally, he was following this stuff and he was like, hey man, you guys have that guy Alex Jones here.
[01:16:59.429 --> 01:17:00.589]  And I was like, yeah, we do.
[01:17:00.629 --> 01:17:01.350]  He's from New York.
[01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:10.575]  And he heard about you through watching the Your Tyranny video, the Waco video, on the
[01:17:12.755 --> 01:17:13.096]  What was it?
[01:17:13.136 --> 01:17:14.079]  Bohemian Grove.
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:17.772]  You have that running on your website, or you did, at least at one point.
[01:17:19.777 --> 01:17:20.718]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:28.081]  Until 20 million people went and watched it, and my bank account went into the red, I still put a lot of free stuff on the site.
[01:17:28.121 --> 01:17:29.422]  Listen, what else is on your mind, buddy?
[01:17:29.802 --> 01:17:30.422]  Well, nothing.
[01:17:30.462 --> 01:17:32.403]  I was just calling to say keep up the good work.
[01:17:32.603 --> 01:17:35.765]  One space at a time, the word will get out.
[01:17:35.965 --> 01:17:37.106]  I appreciate it.
[01:17:37.126 --> 01:17:38.646]  Hey, I appreciate you too, Kerry.
[01:17:39.067 --> 01:17:42.328]  You know, caring and being involved and trying to be informed.
[01:17:42.388 --> 01:17:44.149]  And you certainly are, so thank you.
[01:17:44.929 --> 01:17:46.130]  Another call from Austin.
[01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:47.311]  Mike in Austin, Texas.
[01:17:47.351 --> 01:17:47.971]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:17:49.249 --> 01:17:50.750]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:17:50.770 --> 01:17:51.230]  You bet.
[01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:52.491]  Just a couple of points.
[01:17:53.011 --> 01:17:56.073]  I mean, riding a bike is right at your own risk, but that's the way life is.
[01:17:56.393 --> 01:18:02.737]  But I wanted to say that I had an idea that everyone stop buying gasoline on Wednesdays.
[01:18:03.498 --> 01:18:07.020]  And we do that for a while, just send a message.
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:11.623]  Well, they've had a national strike not to buy gas, not this weekend, but the weekend before last.
[01:18:12.302 --> 01:18:12.542]  Right.
[01:18:12.622 --> 01:18:14.804]  I think we ought to do it once a week on Wednesday.
[01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:17.146]  Just middle of the week.
[01:18:17.826 --> 01:18:19.968]  If people can abide by that, I think we might.
[01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:21.889]  Well, you know, it always goes up in the summer.
[01:18:21.949 --> 01:18:28.594]  So now they're talking about $4 a gallon gas in some areas of the country and $2.50 even in Texas.
[01:18:29.074 --> 01:18:31.116]  How's $2.50 a gallon sound to you?
[01:18:31.836 --> 01:18:34.778]  Well, I get about 8 miles per gallon.
[01:18:34.979 --> 01:18:36.039]  So it doesn't sound very good.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.440]  Are you a truck driver?
[01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:38.361]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:38.721 --> 01:18:39.442]  I do construction.
[01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:45.607]  Beyond that, people need to realize that chemtrails are real.
[01:18:46.228 --> 01:18:48.589]  It ties in directly to HAARP.
[01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:50.931]  I've done quite a bit of investigating into that.
[01:18:51.432 --> 01:18:54.354]  The Earth is 20% darker.
[01:18:54.434 --> 01:18:56.776]  NASA admits it's the, quote, condensation trails.
[01:18:57.116 --> 01:19:02.921]  These new special ice crystals that form at 4,000 feet, they never formed before above 25,000 feet.
[01:19:03.462 --> 01:19:05.083]  And magically, they don't dissipate.
[01:19:05.103 --> 01:19:06.324]  They turn into cloud banks, yes.
[01:19:07.017 --> 01:19:10.420]  Well, I urge people to go to a search engine and look up HAARP.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.560]  Look up the patent.
[01:19:12.361 --> 01:19:15.463]  The patent says exactly what it's capable of doing.
[01:19:15.483 --> 01:19:19.266]  They can also look into GWEN, ELF, and TETRA.
[01:19:20.187 --> 01:19:23.389]  And they're just electromagnetic energy frequencies.
[01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:32.016]  And the metallic blanket that they're spraying in the sky is a conductive lens to focus energy.
[01:19:32.256 --> 01:19:33.597]  Yeah, it's a resident system.
[01:19:34.446 --> 01:19:40.570]  Uh, for radar, for weather control, it has many different, uh, facets, including mind control, and this is mainstream, folks.
[01:19:41.170 --> 01:19:42.511]  All right, Mike, good to hear from you.
[01:19:42.531 --> 01:19:50.275]  Cliff and others, up next when we get back, and then I'll get into more on the Patriot Act, a new, I guess, Patriot Act III, and, uh, much more.
[01:19:53.718 --> 01:19:56.981]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:57.041 --> 01:20:01.204]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:04.267]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:04.447 --> 01:20:06.849]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:07.049 --> 01:20:15.696]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:15.896 --> 01:20:17.237]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:20:17.418 --> 01:20:21.561]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:21.821 --> 01:20:22.342]  We're good to go!
[01:20:40.885 --> 01:20:43.968]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[01:20:44.088 --> 01:20:45.169]  Are you running out of ideas?
[01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.830]  Out of time?
[01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:49.393]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[01:21:02.972 --> 01:21:05.794]  Well, think of a song, written especially for them.
[01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:14.040]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:17.763]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.
[01:21:18.103 --> 01:21:26.129]  Songsforever.com will use that information brought to us by you to compose a unique song with original lyrics inspired by everything you've told us.
[01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:27.189]  Just listen.
[01:21:35.544 --> 01:21:40.751]  Birthday coming soon?
[01:21:41.151 --> 01:21:41.852]  Anniversary?
[01:21:42.353 --> 01:21:43.054]  Wedding perhaps?
[01:21:43.675 --> 01:21:44.616]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[01:21:45.177 --> 01:21:49.142]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[01:21:49.603 --> 01:21:51.906]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[01:21:53.399 --> 01:21:57.301]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:21:57.521 --> 01:22:09.807]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:22:10.227 --> 01:22:10.627]  The U.S.
[01:22:10.667 --> 01:22:16.250]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:18.871]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:22:20.732 --> 01:22:21.792]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:22:21.812 --> 01:22:24.673]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:30.794]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:22:31.235 --> 01:22:34.595]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:22:34.675 --> 01:22:40.997]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:22:41.577 --> 01:22:45.585]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:22:45.705 --> 01:22:45.966]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.986 --> 01:22:46.226]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.621]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:22:55.881 --> 01:22:59.702]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:23:00.042 --> 01:23:00.842]  Read the labels.
[01:23:01.283 --> 01:23:05.404]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:23:05.624 --> 01:23:09.805]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:15.067]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:23:15.447 --> 01:23:19.029]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:24.573]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.575]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:23:27.875 --> 01:23:28.776]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:23:29.076 --> 01:23:39.803]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:50.111]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[01:23:56.236 --> 01:24:02.261]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:24:02.881 --> 01:24:05.844]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:13.085 --> 01:24:17.089]  We will get to more of your wondrous calls in the next segment.
[01:24:19.672 --> 01:24:22.835]  But right now I wanted to get to this story here.
[01:24:22.855 --> 01:24:24.757]  This is out of the New York Times.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:32.846]  And it says, Officials juggle bids for positions in the new Iraq.
[01:24:34.443 --> 01:24:35.464]  Bids for positions.
[01:24:35.484 --> 01:24:40.529]  See, people come to them and say, I want to be part of the new Iraqi Governing Council.
[01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:43.552]  And then our government appoints them.
[01:24:46.474 --> 01:24:47.135]  Think about that.
[01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:58.386]  President Bush prepared for a campaign to rally support of the United Nations for his policies in Iraq,
[01:24:59.506 --> 01:25:13.396]  On Sunday, while senior envoys struggled in Baghdad with competing demands by Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds for the top positions of the new caretaker, government officials said, Oh, it's a caretaker!
[01:25:13.416 --> 01:25:14.317]  It's appointed!
[01:25:14.397 --> 01:25:15.538]  It's democracy!
[01:25:15.578 --> 01:25:18.620]  So, I guess our government can be appointed and it can be democracy.
[01:25:20.501 --> 01:25:24.224]  And just a side issue also from the Austin American Statesman.
[01:25:24.584 --> 01:25:25.725]  That was a New York Times article.
[01:25:25.765 --> 01:25:26.726]  This is a Statesman article.
[01:25:27.226 --> 01:25:30.749]  In the womb, baby photos draw attention from regulators.
[01:25:30.769 --> 01:25:38.335]  They're trying to shut down these medical outfits where you can go get the 3D ultrasound of your baby.
[01:25:38.375 --> 01:25:39.857]  And I've talked to doctors about this.
[01:25:39.877 --> 01:25:41.378]  They say it's not dangerous.
[01:25:42.362 --> 01:25:44.883]  But why does the government not want you to have this?
[01:25:44.963 --> 01:25:52.165]  I mean, they've got the same stuff in the airports that'll look right through your clothes, they can turn it up higher and look right into your body, your beating heart.
[01:25:52.625 --> 01:25:56.466]  That's what this ground penetrating radar does, that's all it is.
[01:25:58.527 --> 01:26:02.628]  But because they don't want you to see how these are little babies alive.
[01:26:02.888 --> 01:26:05.189]  I mean, even at three or four months fully formed.
[01:26:05.989 --> 01:26:11.111]  And it says, ultrasound firm says its services don't fall under keepsake label.
[01:26:12.136 --> 01:26:21.261]  And the Clearview Ultrasound of Austin offers what it calls extraordinary bonding experience for those who want to see their unborn child moving inside the womb.
[01:26:21.461 --> 01:26:23.322]  We see babies smile and wave.
[01:26:23.763 --> 01:26:30.507]  Co-owner Kathy Dimmick said of the images, it's $140,000 equipment produces.
[01:26:30.567 --> 01:26:34.609]  It's amazing what this technology has been able to show.
[01:26:34.969 --> 01:26:39.472]  Often mothers, and especially fathers, cry at the first glimpse of the baby.
[01:26:39.832 --> 01:26:41.473]  I mean, it's crisp and clear, folks.
[01:26:42.208 --> 01:26:49.895]  But the Food and Drug Administration has determined that using fetal ultrasound for non-medical purposes presents serious public health issues.
[01:26:51.016 --> 01:26:51.116]  Ah!
[01:26:52.478 --> 01:27:00.605]  They say ultrasound is totally safe, and if it's, quote, in a medical checkup, it's okay, but if you have a doctor running one of these just because you want to see your baby, that shouldn't be legal.
[01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:03.584]  See, now it's not just the police saying you can't videotape them.
[01:27:03.604 --> 01:27:05.265]  We're going to arrest you even though there's no law.
[01:27:05.645 --> 01:27:07.646]  Now, oh, by the way, don't look at your baby.
[01:27:07.846 --> 01:27:10.167]  Don't show people those crisp images of the human being.
[01:27:10.427 --> 01:27:11.488]  That's just a fetus.
[01:27:11.768 --> 01:27:13.329]  That's just a blob of tissue.
[01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:18.071]  Because this thing is really slashing abortion.
[01:27:18.151 --> 01:27:24.734]  Abortion is... the statistics, the numbers, the numbers of abortions, it's starting to slow down and it's freaking them out.
[01:27:25.054 --> 01:27:25.875]  That's why this is happening.
[01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:36.280]  The Food and Drug Administration has determined that using fetal ultrasound for non-medical purposes presents serious public health issues, spokesman Sharon Snyder said.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:42.104]  Because ultrasound is a form of energy, pregnant women should avoid unnecessary exposures, she said.
[01:27:43.126 --> 01:27:56.331]  Although there is no evidence to date that ultrasound is unsafe for the woman or the fetus, it can produce physical effects in tissue such as mechanical vibrations and the slight rise in temperature.
[01:27:59.512 --> 01:28:05.775]  The FDA said in a consumer advisory last year, well the FDA says that, then how do they have these in five airports?
[01:28:06.175 --> 01:28:07.215]  It's the same thing!
[01:28:08.256 --> 01:28:08.896]  Same system!
[01:28:10.143 --> 01:28:13.968]  The agency is aggressively evaluating its enforcement options, Snyder said.
[01:28:14.688 --> 01:28:16.931]  We urge state authorities to look into it.
[01:28:17.351 --> 01:28:27.363]  The State Department of Health, Drugs, and Medical Devices Division is investigating several keepsake companies to see whether they are using medical devices for entertainment.
[01:28:28.730 --> 01:28:30.891]  Program Director Tom Brink said.
[01:28:31.312 --> 01:28:35.635]  Boy, do they go investigate, you know, these plastic surgeons maiming people?
[01:28:36.135 --> 01:28:44.662]  Do they go investigate, you know, obviously women getting larger, augmented breasts for their entertainment, for their enjoyment?
[01:28:45.423 --> 01:28:50.467]  No, they don't mess with that, but oh, we may have to shut down showing that these are babies in there!
[01:28:53.109 --> 01:28:54.590]  When is it going to end, people?
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:56.780]  When is it going to end?
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.541]  Oh, we want you to have freedom with your body.
[01:28:58.561 --> 01:29:00.021]  We want you to be able to kill that baby.
[01:29:00.381 --> 01:29:02.762]  But you don't have the right to look at it!
[01:29:04.542 --> 01:29:11.524]  We want your 12-year-old to have the right, the government says, to go have an abortion without your authorization and have the public school pay for it.
[01:29:12.004 --> 01:29:15.085]  But they've got to get a letter to go to the planetarium or the zoo from you.
[01:29:16.405 --> 01:29:21.066]  So, we want your children to be able to kill their babies, but we don't want you to be able to look at your baby.
[01:29:21.106 --> 01:29:23.947]  You can kill your baby, but you can't look at it.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:27.401]  Because then you might decide not to kill it.
[01:29:28.001 --> 01:29:29.402]  And believe me, that's why this is happening.
[01:29:30.603 --> 01:29:36.406]  It doesn't matter if they got doctors who go, hey, I'll go into business, show people their baby with this new 3D system.
[01:29:37.146 --> 01:29:38.166]  No, no, no!
[01:29:38.246 --> 01:29:40.047]  We're gonna have to shut this down.
[01:29:40.087 --> 01:29:42.389]  Your calls and a bunch of important news coming up.
[01:29:43.989 --> 01:29:44.910]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:46.991]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.911 --> 01:29:50.593]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.042 --> 01:29:57.946]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:29:58.186 --> 01:30:03.611]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:30:03.891 --> 01:30:14.261]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:30:14.441 --> 01:30:18.765]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:30:18.945 --> 01:30:19.745]  We're good to go!

[01:30:56.149 --> 01:31:01.634]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:02.075 --> 01:31:06.299]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:06.539 --> 01:31:13.566]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.946 --> 01:31:20.072]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:20.212 --> 01:31:21.413]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:21.753 --> 01:31:24.694]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:24.854 --> 01:31:26.835]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:27.175 --> 01:31:34.418]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[01:31:55.266 --> 01:31:56.246]  Spring has arrived!
[01:31:56.426 --> 01:31:59.388]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:31:59.608 --> 01:32:03.070]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:11.434]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:33:03.875 --> 01:33:05.796]  Alright, it's this live Monday edition.
[01:33:05.836 --> 01:33:08.518]  We've reached the halfway point of this global transmission.
[01:33:08.538 --> 01:33:10.800]  33 minutes past the hour.
[01:33:12.561 --> 01:33:14.282]  And your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:14.302 --> 01:33:15.503]  Let me get into some more of this news.
[01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:17.365]  It's all very important, so it needs to be covered.
[01:33:18.986 --> 01:33:20.987]  This is out of the New York Times as well.
[01:33:21.207 --> 01:33:21.467]  U.S.
[01:33:21.547 --> 01:33:23.729]  set to erect virtual borders.
[01:33:24.810 --> 01:33:29.213]  Bidders with Texas ties vie to build database network to attract visitors.
[01:33:29.233 --> 01:33:32.175]  The Department of Homeland Security is on the verge of awarding
[01:33:33.911 --> 01:33:48.242]  The highest contract in its young history for a far-reaching system that could cost as much as $16 billion and would employ a network of computer databases to track visitors to the United States long before they set foot here.
[01:33:49.783 --> 01:33:52.264]  And it goes on in the article.
[01:33:52.465 --> 01:33:54.766]  I've got another one here out of the Washington Post I want to go over.
[01:33:58.419 --> 01:34:06.662]  Five years ago, maybe it's six years ago now, time just keeps flying by us, there were official United Nations press releases.
[01:34:07.862 --> 01:34:12.664]  You learn so much reading corporate and government and quasi-governmental press releases.
[01:34:12.724 --> 01:34:19.386]  And they had this big borders symposium in Australia.
[01:34:19.646 --> 01:34:20.507]  No, it was New Zealand.
[01:34:20.527 --> 01:34:21.387]  I'm going from memory here.
[01:34:22.811 --> 01:34:31.993]  And they said, we have to have a global ID card, and this is going to fit in with the new global sales tax, and global energy tax, and global money transfer tax.
[01:34:32.873 --> 01:34:34.453]  They said, how we'll sell it?
[01:34:34.533 --> 01:34:35.494]  I mean, this is out in the open.
[01:34:35.514 --> 01:34:41.435]  This is a press release to other governmental offices, or kind of a memorandum of understanding via treaty law.
[01:34:41.455 --> 01:34:44.015]  I ought to dig that back out and post that.
[01:34:44.035 --> 01:34:44.595]  That was interesting.
[01:34:44.656 --> 01:34:45.996]  I spent weeks on that.
[01:34:46.016 --> 01:34:46.856]  It was so dangerous.
[01:34:47.356 --> 01:34:51.717]  And since I've seen countless other stories along those lines, as the infrastructure is put in,
[01:34:53.084 --> 01:35:02.616]  And I said, we'll sell it, that you don't have to have a World ID card in your country, but if you want to leave the country, you have to have this card.
[01:35:03.536 --> 01:35:09.278]  And we'll sell it that, oh, well, it's to keep bad foreigners from coming into your country.
[01:35:09.678 --> 01:35:12.059]  But then when you leave, you'll have to have it, too.
[01:35:12.099 --> 01:35:18.461]  And it'll be a certain identification number, a biometric photo, a biometric thumbprint.
[01:35:18.921 --> 01:35:21.742]  And now the new passports are doing that.
[01:35:21.802 --> 01:35:22.622]  You want a passport?
[01:35:22.922 --> 01:35:24.242]  You've got to do it as an American.
[01:35:24.542 --> 01:35:26.703]  But then you hear, oh, it's just for the foreigners.
[01:35:27.023 --> 01:35:33.105]  When they come in, they get the background check and all of this and have to be biometrically scanned and thumbprinted and put into the system.
[01:35:33.948 --> 01:35:35.970]  So it's a global ID card.
[01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:37.832]  And then Bush said about, what, five months ago?
[01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:40.194]  He said, oh, but don't worry.
[01:35:40.634 --> 01:35:44.838]  Canadians, Germans, Chinese, Africans, they all have to do it.
[01:35:45.118 --> 01:35:48.501]  But if you're from Mexico, you're waived.
[01:35:48.641 --> 01:35:49.562]  You don't have to do this.
[01:35:49.582 --> 01:35:52.325]  But as a citizen to get a driver's license in most states, you have to.
[01:35:52.645 --> 01:35:56.288]  And now to get a, they're now shifting over to the new passport.
[01:35:56.608 --> 01:35:57.289]  You have to do it.
[01:35:57.369 --> 01:35:59.211]  So citizens have to do it.
[01:35:59.870 --> 01:36:08.435]  Foreigners have to do it, but of course they'll be allowed in, but not if you're from precious Mexico that we're being merged with in the Pan American Union, the first big step in that.
[01:36:10.017 --> 01:36:21.701]  So the Department of Homeland Security is on the verge of awarding the biggest contract in its young history for an elaborate system that would cost as much as $15 billion and employ a network of databases to track visitors in the United States long before they arrive.
[01:36:22.201 --> 01:36:39.147]  The contract, which will probably be awarded in coming days to one of three final bidders, is already generating considerable interest as federal officials try to improve significantly their ability to monitor those who enter and more than 300 border crossings, checkpoints by land, sea and air, where they are going and where they pose a
[01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:40.747]  Terrorist threat.
[01:36:42.848 --> 01:36:45.509]  And again, it's the same integrated system.
[01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:48.691]  Ashrawans tied into InfoPol 9 in Europe.
[01:36:49.191 --> 01:36:50.151]  Their big spy system.
[01:36:50.171 --> 01:36:54.513]  It's all one big grid, and they're calling it a virtual border.
[01:36:55.454 --> 01:36:56.254]  Virtual!
[01:36:57.715 --> 01:37:02.477]  But they'll also accept any of the fake ID cards issued by now dozens of consulates.
[01:37:02.837 --> 01:37:07.239]  These matricula cards, which we had the head of the Colorado Senate on last year.
[01:37:08.413 --> 01:37:11.898]  He went out himself to prove it and got four ID cards with four different names.
[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:17.285]  So, you're going to be micromanaged, you're going to be controlled as a citizen.
[01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:21.771]  And you could be secretly arrested and secretly executed if you have a fake ID card.
[01:37:21.871 --> 01:37:22.993]  Yeah, that's in Patriot Act too.
[01:37:23.534 --> 01:37:25.236]  That's an act of high terrorism.
[01:37:25.859 --> 01:37:28.200]  But if you're an illegal alien, it's totally legal.
[01:37:28.481 --> 01:37:45.791]  By the way, a major banking chain, Wells Fargo, Vicente Fox was here last year, actually earlier this year, giving awards to the city and to Wells Fargo for not following the laws, and that was for the city, and Wells Fargo for issuing their own ID card to banks and businesses, and government is accepting.
[01:37:45.851 --> 01:37:48.032]  Why banks issue IDs now?
[01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:50.834]  But not if you're a citizen, baby.
[01:37:51.154 --> 01:37:53.216]  You better show three forms with a thumbprint.
[01:37:53.576 --> 01:37:53.876]  Lick.
[01:37:54.176 --> 01:37:54.556]  Their.
[01:37:54.897 --> 01:37:55.277]  Boots.
[01:37:55.996 --> 01:37:59.079]  And then one of my good friends has been an apartment manager for over 20 years.
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:02.022]  She manages the biggest apartment complex in Austin.
[01:38:02.663 --> 01:38:06.727]  Works for the largest property management company in the country.
[01:38:07.468 --> 01:38:17.758]  And last year, last Christmas, she was at their big corporate meeting in Dallas, and sitting around in the big conference room, and she was told, and they were all told, give a citizen
[01:38:18.661 --> 01:38:20.002]  Black, white, Hispanic, doesn't matter.
[01:38:20.022 --> 01:38:20.862]  They just said openly.
[01:38:20.922 --> 01:38:22.482]  And then they said, don't tell anybody about this.
[01:38:23.043 --> 01:38:24.703]  I need to get her on the air, but she'd lose her job.
[01:38:24.723 --> 01:38:25.243]  She won't do it.
[01:38:25.643 --> 01:38:30.545]  She said, look, if it's a citizen, they can only have two people if it's a two, you know, apartment, two person apartment.
[01:38:30.865 --> 01:38:31.926]  Four if it's a four person.
[01:38:32.326 --> 01:38:35.807]  Even if somebody looks like they're visiting more than a week, fine them, kick them out, whatever.
[01:38:36.367 --> 01:38:39.009]  We've secretly been taken over by government housing.
[01:38:39.069 --> 01:38:40.190]  One third of our housing is.
[01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:42.852]  We no longer have to pay any income tax because of this.
[01:38:43.233 --> 01:38:47.136]  But the government's told us, let illegal stay 10 to a room if they want to.
[01:38:47.376 --> 01:38:48.517]  These are nice apartments.
[01:38:48.737 --> 01:38:50.478]  People are wondering why this is all happening.
[01:38:50.638 --> 01:38:52.540]  So it's designed.
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:57.084]  Why do people who come to this country, these immigrants, why do they get 10 years without having to pay taxes?
[01:38:57.104 --> 01:38:57.624]  Did you know that?
[01:38:58.204 --> 01:39:02.528]  It's designed to displace the people that were already indigenously here.
[01:39:03.553 --> 01:39:08.516]  It's designed to evaporate the middle class to have a giant servant-slave class.
[01:39:08.997 --> 01:39:11.639]  After they're done, oh, the foreigners will have to pay taxes.
[01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:17.323]  Okay, I've got a bunch of other key news, but let's go back to the calls as promised.
[01:39:17.843 --> 01:39:20.665]  I guess up next here is Cliff in Tejas, in Texas.
[01:39:20.705 --> 01:39:21.125]  Go ahead.
[01:39:21.145 --> 01:39:22.186]  How you doing?
[01:39:22.426 --> 01:39:22.706]  Good.
[01:39:23.187 --> 01:39:23.447]  Good.
[01:39:23.727 --> 01:39:26.969]  I'm going to try and stay on topic here with the last round of calls.
[01:39:27.429 --> 01:39:30.672]  As far as the Nick Berg beheading video goes,
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.661]  I have to say I watched it two times.
[01:39:34.502 --> 01:39:36.403]  And there was definitely something going on.
[01:39:36.463 --> 01:39:39.365]  I mean, I was kind of creeped out by watching it.
[01:39:39.665 --> 01:39:53.755]  But wouldn't you think if you're a terrorist and you're going to behead someone, it'd be easy to slip on a wedding ring or stage that it could possibly be, you know, Americans or whatnot.
[01:39:53.915 --> 01:39:58.699]  And second off, I mean, how do you actually go about staging a beheading?
[01:39:58.859 --> 01:40:00.260]  You know, I mean, was he already dead?
[01:40:01.586 --> 01:40:12.251]  I'm glad you bring this up, but that's why we do a disservice, Cliff, if we don't give people background.
[01:40:12.791 --> 01:40:22.476]  Nick Byrd drops out of an Ivy League college with almost a perfect grade point average, classic intelligence MO, is connected now to two hijackers with his passcodes,
[01:40:24.035 --> 01:40:27.681]  On bus rides, he just gives him his computer, two separate caches and gives him codes.
[01:40:27.741 --> 01:40:29.063]  It's just no big deal.
[01:40:29.764 --> 01:40:35.474]  Then he travels around the world helping the poor disadvantaged, the quiet American with his bag of high-tech electronics.
[01:40:36.289 --> 01:40:37.950]  He works at Abu Ghraib prison.
[01:40:38.811 --> 01:40:42.094]  He works with a shadowy Iraqi connected to Russian organized crime.
[01:40:42.134 --> 01:40:52.302]  He also works for the State Department and then he just magically gets grabbed by the security forces and then gets released and within hours is in Al-Syed's hands.
[01:40:52.342 --> 01:40:57.486]  Now they admit it wasn't Al-Qaeda and the person they claim cut his head off has been dead for over three months.
[01:40:57.907 --> 01:41:01.910]  This is all admitted by the way and now top doctors in the US, Australia, all over
[01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:05.332]  I mean, it definitely looks as though, yeah, there's no blood.
[01:41:24.741 --> 01:41:26.482]  You know, there's a little bit of blood on the ground.
[01:41:26.502 --> 01:41:30.784]  Yeah, but it's not like what you would think if there'd be splattering all over the walls or something.
[01:41:30.804 --> 01:41:32.926]  I mean, we've seen horror movies that are worse than that.
[01:41:33.126 --> 01:41:44.612]  But, um, you know, yeah, I had no idea about him working at Albuquerque Prison and stuff, but it just seemed so odd that, you know, they would have, like, someone who could craft a head and, you know, look just like his.
[01:41:44.792 --> 01:41:51.456]  Well, you know, I, you know, last summer I almost completely cut my finger off and it was flopping around and it was blood spraying.
[01:41:52.202 --> 01:42:02.073]  Yeah, and the timing of it also.
[01:42:02.454 --> 01:42:06.699]  Abu Ghraib, here we're abusing all these prisoners and look how bad we are.
[01:42:06.759 --> 01:42:08.060]  Well, look how good we are.
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:10.203]  We're fighting these guys and they're cutting people's heads off.
[01:42:11.232 --> 01:42:13.474]  Yeah, CBS handled this stuff a long time before.
[01:42:13.514 --> 01:42:14.555]  They held off on it.
[01:42:16.076 --> 01:42:17.037]  Folks, this is scripted.
[01:42:17.357 --> 01:42:18.398]  Okay, good to hear from you, Cliff.
[01:42:18.418 --> 01:42:19.118]  Interesting points.
[01:42:19.919 --> 01:42:21.560]  Let's talk to Malte in Denmark.
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:22.541]  Malte, welcome!
[01:42:26.964 --> 01:42:28.365]  Hello, Alex.
[01:42:28.706 --> 01:42:29.226]  Hello!
[01:42:29.626 --> 01:42:33.289]  I just want to make a little comment about this, about the Catholic Church.
[01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:40.395]  Maybe it's about the best involvement in Luminosity in the Catholic Church.
[01:42:40.928 --> 01:42:43.830]  It was a real Illuminati founder of the Catholic Church.
[01:42:44.970 --> 01:42:45.931]  That's what one is saying.
[01:42:47.412 --> 01:42:52.715]  Are you saying that... The Illuminati founded the Catholic Church 2,000 years ago.
[01:42:55.996 --> 01:42:57.797]  Well, people can certainly debate that.
[01:42:57.897 --> 01:43:06.142]  I've heard that said, but... I mean, the Catholic Church was supposedly founded by one of the Apostles.
[01:43:06.162 --> 01:43:09.564]  Are you saying that one of the Apostles was an Illuminati agent?
[01:43:10.269 --> 01:43:11.470]  I don't know.
[01:43:12.071 --> 01:43:21.057]  The Bush family... What happened is you had the Christian Church underground and then later a Roman Emperor took it over and made it the official language.
[01:43:22.158 --> 01:43:25.600]  I wouldn't even say the Catholic Church goes back 2,000 years.
[01:43:25.881 --> 01:43:36.328]  Why read this guy who made Catholic Church the state religion in the Roman Empire?
[01:43:36.849 --> 01:43:38.310]  Constantine.
[01:43:39.482 --> 01:43:42.563]  Yeah, he was in a bloodline of the Illuminati.
[01:43:43.904 --> 01:43:44.664]  Very interesting.
[01:43:44.704 --> 01:43:45.625]  I appreciate the call.
[01:43:46.165 --> 01:43:47.926]  How's stuff going over in Denmark?
[01:43:48.946 --> 01:43:51.287]  I don't know.
[01:43:51.848 --> 01:43:53.388]  It's quite okay.
[01:43:54.389 --> 01:43:56.990]  I don't hope we get some terrorist attacks.
[01:43:57.475 --> 01:44:02.038]  We have this European referendum, I don't know, maybe next fall.
[01:44:02.078 --> 01:44:04.740]  Yeah, a terror attack will probably help the globals get their plan through.
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:05.380]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:06.781]  I appreciate it, Malta.
[01:44:07.401 --> 01:44:09.403]  Let's talk to Mark in Ohio.
[01:44:09.503 --> 01:44:10.363]  Mark, go ahead.
[01:44:11.704 --> 01:44:11.924]  Alec?
[01:44:12.245 --> 01:44:12.725]  Yes, Alec?
[01:44:13.485 --> 01:44:19.449]  Okay, I was just wondering, you were talking about the ultrasound and all that.
[01:44:19.549 --> 01:44:25.453]  Not the ultrasound, but the ground-penetrating radar that can be used to look at the children before they're born?
[01:44:25.513 --> 01:44:26.874]  Yeah, it's basically the same thing.
[01:44:27.389 --> 01:44:30.192]  Well, I was also listening last night of Art Bell.
[01:44:30.272 --> 01:44:35.636]  I'm not a big fan of Art Bell, but he did have some interesting information out about BPL.
[01:44:36.617 --> 01:44:44.344]  Yeah, well, the ultra-high frequency data transfer down power lines has nothing to do with ground penetrating radar.
[01:44:44.364 --> 01:44:48.908]  Well, the thing of it is, to me, it's been proven that people who live under high-powered power lines
[01:44:49.931 --> 01:44:53.212]  Well, certainly it's been proven that cell phones, all of it, is not good for you.
[01:45:15.142 --> 01:45:16.162]  And that's my point.
[01:45:16.282 --> 01:45:30.472]  This ultrasound isn't bad for you, but now it's so crisp it shows the baby in perfect detail, people are then not aborting their children, and the globalists now want to ban you being able to see your baby in an ultrasound at a private facility.
[01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:33.893]  Well, you know, it comes down to this.
[01:45:33.973 --> 01:45:35.615]  They found out that, hey, they could make money.
[01:45:35.936 --> 01:45:37.277]  Doctors could make money doing it.
[01:45:37.578 --> 01:45:39.260]  They'd be doing a good service for the people.
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:40.121]  They don't want them to do it.
[01:45:40.141 --> 01:45:46.370]  Yeah, they're telling the family, you can kill that baby anytime you want up until it's born, but you can't look at it.
[01:45:46.934 --> 01:45:48.535]  Yeah, that's what it comes down to.
[01:45:49.255 --> 01:45:51.937]  And thank you for doing such a service for us.
[01:45:52.177 --> 01:45:53.198]  Hey, thank you, Mark, for the call.
[01:45:53.218 --> 01:45:53.678]  Good points.
[01:45:54.459 --> 01:45:55.379]  Rob in Wyoming.
[01:45:55.459 --> 01:45:56.160]  Rob, go ahead.
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.181]  Alex, two things.
[01:45:58.241 --> 01:46:01.403]  The Patriot Act and the Patriot Act 2 both refer to U.S.
[01:46:01.523 --> 01:46:03.904]  persons and agents of a foreign power.
[01:46:03.924 --> 01:46:06.586]  Yeah, and by that definition, that's then under the 14th Amendment.
[01:46:11.016 --> 01:46:12.596]  If they say, do you reside?
[01:46:12.756 --> 01:46:14.217]  Are you under the city of Austin?
[01:46:14.257 --> 01:46:16.257]  You're then agreeing to their corporate fiction.
[01:46:16.617 --> 01:46:18.378]  Reside means you're doing business there.
[01:46:19.878 --> 01:46:23.419]  People, I'm really grateful to what you've done for us, man.
[01:46:24.279 --> 01:46:26.959]  I would like to see... Listen, callers, you guys need to stop telling me how great I am.
[01:46:26.979 --> 01:46:27.699]  I'm just doing my duty.
[01:46:27.859 --> 01:46:30.160]  That's preceding a slight criticism.
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:39.982]  I would like to see more about the other fork of our defense, which is figuring out the real nature of citizenship and that kind of stuff.
[01:46:41.408 --> 01:46:42.928]  Okay, let me boil it down for people.
[01:46:42.968 --> 01:46:44.229]  It's all contract fraud.
[01:46:44.249 --> 01:46:45.469]  The Federal Reserve is private.
[01:46:45.509 --> 01:46:46.809]  Private banks own the government.
[01:46:46.849 --> 01:46:47.889]  Set up a clone of it.
[01:46:48.309 --> 01:46:50.390]  Built it via the Uniform Commercial Code.
[01:46:50.590 --> 01:46:53.110]  They're now dismantling the old republic.
[01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:54.330]  Getting completely rid of it.
[01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:56.011]  We've had parallel systems for a while.
[01:46:56.251 --> 01:46:59.631]  They're just dismantling the old completely and giving us high-tech tyranny.
[01:46:59.971 --> 01:47:01.012]  Absolutely no rights.
[01:47:01.112 --> 01:47:02.392]  Maritime admiralty.
[01:47:02.752 --> 01:47:03.512]  I got a gun.
[01:47:03.652 --> 01:47:04.772]  I got a black ski mask.
[01:47:05.092 --> 01:47:05.973]  I got a gulag.
[01:47:06.093 --> 01:47:06.793]  I'm your owner.
[01:47:06.813 --> 01:47:08.313]  You know, Roman Empire.
[01:47:09.099 --> 01:47:09.880]  What about this?
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:12.082]  This may be a dumb idea, I'm just throwing it out there.
[01:47:13.363 --> 01:47:19.168]  What if all the patriots, this is to require, it's oversimplified, require a lot of sacrifice and coordination.
[01:47:19.668 --> 01:47:32.599]  All patriots, you know, whatever color they're under, liberal, conservative, whatever, atheist, anything, as long as they're in agreement that the government was complicit behind 9-11, even if they just agree that we can't have a dictatorship here.
[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:35.702]  And they all gravitate toward the same area of the country.
[01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:39.202]  Kind of like the Free States Project, only with more teeth in it.
[01:47:39.222 --> 01:47:44.506]  The problem is, anything big gets infiltrated with provocateurs.
[01:47:44.546 --> 01:47:51.051]  What we need is millions of people fighting, building their own media empires, educating people.
[01:47:51.972 --> 01:47:52.632]  That's what we need.
[01:47:52.692 --> 01:47:55.294]  By media empire, I mean a hundred people you inform a month.
[01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:56.635]  That is incredible.
[01:47:56.655 --> 01:48:04.141]  Start websites, get access to TV shows, get local talk shows, call into talk shows, form organizations, pick a couple issues.
[01:48:04.561 --> 01:48:12.047]  I'm trying to get public access show to show your films, especially 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and the sequel, Masters of Terror.
[01:48:13.007 --> 01:48:16.070]  They have to read their bylaws.
[01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:18.592]  I know they do, but it's a hassle.
[01:48:18.752 --> 01:48:24.356]  It's hard to know which one, like the TIPS program, you're drafted into watching a monitor screen.
[01:48:24.756 --> 01:48:29.320]  What if everybody just sent in news tips that the government was behind 9-11?
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:32.744]  And then that way they can't deny and claim.
[01:48:32.824 --> 01:48:34.047]  I've kept receipts of all of them.
[01:48:34.067 --> 01:48:40.139]  Well, you know, I got on there before 9-11 and I said they're going to use bin Laden as the Patsy to attack New York, call the White House, tell them not to do it.
[01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:42.163]  And that's prior knowledge right there.
[01:48:43.628 --> 01:48:45.329]  So I think that's a good idea.
[01:48:45.549 --> 01:48:53.137]  People should call in to the FBI and others and the Homeland Security and say, okay, here's the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:48:53.337 --> 01:48:54.978]  Do you want evidence of people with prior knowledge?
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:57.781]  And they'll say, yes, okay.
[01:48:58.101 --> 01:49:01.304]  San Francisco Chronicle says the White House called Mayor Willie Brown to fly.
[01:49:01.525 --> 01:49:03.106]  Here's MSNBC Newsweek.
[01:49:03.407 --> 01:49:06.329]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff admit they were told not to fly by the White House.
[01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:07.951]  So go investigate them.
[01:49:08.311 --> 01:49:14.973]  And if they ignore the tips from thousands and thousands of millions of people, that means that they provably complicitly aiding and abetting the Patriot Act.
[01:49:15.013 --> 01:49:15.393]  You know what?
[01:49:15.433 --> 01:49:16.453]  We could rent time.
[01:49:16.993 --> 01:49:20.194]  We could rent time on a big TV station somewhere on the East Coast.
[01:49:20.554 --> 01:49:23.975]  Have them man the phone banks and go, everybody call right now.
[01:49:24.015 --> 01:49:24.896]  We're going to talk to them.
[01:49:25.176 --> 01:49:26.036]  See what they're saying.
[01:49:26.056 --> 01:49:27.877]  We're calling the government and asking them about this.
[01:49:28.137 --> 01:49:29.237]  That'd be a good stunt to pull.
[01:49:31.338 --> 01:49:39.160]  We're calling the government and asking them why the FBI agents who blocked the good FBI agents from stopping Al Qaeda got record cash bonuses.
[01:49:39.781 --> 01:49:46.363]  Well, I called one of my senator's aides who's advising him and interpreting legislation for him, and he didn't agree that, uh, what is it?
[01:49:48.282 --> 01:49:54.347]  Uh, 254B, I think the one that defines, uh, or the one that's the so-called sunset clause in the Patriot Act.
[01:49:54.747 --> 01:49:55.167]  Uh, yeah.
[01:49:56.048 --> 01:49:56.268]  224B.
[01:49:56.669 --> 01:50:03.774]  224A and B, but especially B. No, it says, it lists, all of these are not sunsetted, and it's all the key subsections, 215, 214, uh, 802,
[01:50:07.097 --> 01:50:15.846]  Well, but even beyond that, B says any investigation initiated before the sunset, which by definition, they can't be initiated after the sunset under the... Well, I mean, how crazy are you?
[01:50:15.886 --> 01:50:17.187]  You actually read bills!
[01:50:17.228 --> 01:50:18.649]  That's al-Qaeda-ish right there!
[01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:19.830]  Well, I'm a thought criminal.
[01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:21.552]  You should just believe whatever they tell you!
[01:50:21.992 --> 01:50:22.513]  Well, I can't.
[01:50:22.533 --> 01:50:25.156]  You know, Rumsfeld says he never said there were weapons of mass destruction.
[01:50:25.456 --> 01:50:28.039]  So what if he was on TV a hundred times, conservatively saying it?
[01:50:28.299 --> 01:50:30.061]  He didn't say it, so just shut up!
[01:50:31.119 --> 01:50:35.562]  There's no draft as they set up the draft boards and introduce the legislation.
[01:50:35.882 --> 01:50:37.343]  There's no plan, you're crazy.
[01:50:37.363 --> 01:50:38.884]  Thanks for the call.
[01:50:39.524 --> 01:50:40.465]  It just doesn't exist.
[01:50:40.505 --> 01:50:42.166]  I'm gonna stick my head in the sand here.
[01:50:42.987 --> 01:50:43.887]  Okay, everything's fine.
[01:50:43.947 --> 01:50:44.648]  Government's good.
[01:50:45.068 --> 01:50:46.008]  Never did anything bad.
[01:50:46.028 --> 01:50:47.329]  We should give up all of our freedoms.
[01:50:48.610 --> 01:50:49.811]  Government is God.
[01:50:49.851 --> 01:50:50.871]  I mean, the government says so.
[01:50:50.891 --> 01:50:51.512]  It must be true.
[01:50:55.433 --> 01:50:55.773]  I think so.
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:11.340]  We're good to go!
[01:51:40.217 --> 01:51:43.301]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:51:43.462 --> 01:51:49.330]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:51:52.907 --> 01:51:59.749]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:52:00.049 --> 01:52:01.430]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:52:01.630 --> 01:52:03.830]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:06.071]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:52:06.331 --> 01:52:11.293]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:52:11.613 --> 01:52:15.654]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:52:15.914 --> 01:52:17.675]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:52:17.755 --> 01:52:28.401]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking, implantable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:52:28.562 --> 01:52:30.463]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:52:30.663 --> 01:52:34.525]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.

[01:52:52.358 --> 01:52:53.979]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:52:54.119 --> 01:52:58.242]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:52:58.362 --> 01:53:01.224]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:53:01.324 --> 01:53:08.048]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:53:08.228 --> 01:53:11.230]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:13.812]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:53:13.952 --> 01:53:18.675]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:53:18.835 --> 01:53:33.425]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:53:33.585 --> 01:53:40.009]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-888-9000.
[01:53:43.251 --> 01:53:44.491]  803-4438.
[01:53:44.551 --> 01:53:47.092]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:53:47.212 --> 01:53:56.475]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:54:00.296 --> 01:54:05.217]  We are accelerating towards the third hour.
[01:54:06.418 --> 01:54:07.518]  So stay with us for that.
[01:54:07.858 --> 01:54:11.279]  Coming up, Kerry is related to King Harold.
[01:54:12.071 --> 01:54:18.954]  He's not just related to Queen Elizabeth, he's also related to the royalty in Oslo, Norway.
[01:54:19.814 --> 01:54:22.015]  And to the French, and to everyone else, that's right.
[01:54:22.075 --> 01:54:23.536]  And so is Lord Bush.
[01:54:23.856 --> 01:54:26.277]  They're all very closely related.
[01:54:26.757 --> 01:54:28.858]  Why, they even look quite a bit alike.
[01:54:28.938 --> 01:54:30.038]  How interesting.
[01:54:30.598 --> 01:54:32.899]  Also, White House guilty of breaking propaganda law.
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:34.920]  Hundreds of millions.
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:39.502]  It wasn't 70 million, now we learn it's hundreds of millions of fake newscasts.
[01:54:40.228 --> 01:54:41.109]  Fake newscasts.
[01:54:41.129 --> 01:54:42.370]  I've even seen air here locally.
[01:54:42.410 --> 01:54:43.290]  I don't watch much TV.
[01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:44.511]  Just fake newscasts.
[01:54:44.531 --> 01:54:45.712]  They don't tell you it's the government.
[01:54:45.732 --> 01:54:48.554]  It's just a new news channel you need to believe in.
[01:54:48.575 --> 01:54:54.719]  The Supreme Court just ruled that if they stop your car at a checkpoint and are searching you, they go ahead and search all the other cars.
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:57.321]  If they stop one car, they can stop them all and search them.
[01:54:57.341 --> 01:54:58.142]  It's all part of the freedom.
[01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:07.017]  And a lot more coming up in the third hour, and of course your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:55:07.037 --> 01:55:16.484]  Some of the other story, a split in OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and Saudi's talk of pumping more to get Bush re-elected.
[01:55:17.304 --> 01:55:21.467]  Video shows Iraq wedding celebration, the dead babies all over the place, we'll talk about that.
[01:55:22.351 --> 01:55:22.631]  U.K.
[01:55:22.651 --> 01:55:27.452]  plans mini-nuke strike force and Britain becomes less neighborly.
[01:55:27.692 --> 01:55:31.633]  They won't even help their neighbor when they're dead on the ground.
[01:55:32.273 --> 01:55:42.355]  Chalabi's in trouble and just a lot of other key news and information in a huge news blitz that's coming up in the third hour of this Global Transmission.
[01:55:43.096 --> 01:55:49.737]  Before I end this hour, I want to encourage all of you to go sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv today.
[01:55:51.263 --> 01:55:54.169]  PrisonPlanet.tv today.
[01:55:56.473 --> 01:55:58.056]  Most weeks I put up an hour report.
[01:55:58.116 --> 01:55:59.679]  This week I'm going to put up three or
[01:56:00.552 --> 01:56:08.233]  Four different special video reports on a host of issues, special text reports, audio interviews.
[01:56:08.673 --> 01:56:10.394]  Fifteen cents a day if you sign up for a year.
[01:56:10.534 --> 01:56:12.014]  Ninety cents a day if you sign up for a month.
[01:56:12.514 --> 01:56:14.234]  And it makes this broadcast possible.
[01:56:14.274 --> 01:56:15.515]  We're victims of our own success.
[01:56:15.995 --> 01:56:18.715]  My four websites total get over twenty million visitors.
[01:56:18.755 --> 01:56:19.835]  That's visitors, not hits.
[01:56:19.975 --> 01:56:20.396]  Visitors.
[01:56:20.936 --> 01:56:24.636]  A month now, but no one buys anything, so we can't keep paying for it.
[01:56:25.036 --> 01:56:27.577]  So just go sign up, and a lot of it's still free, but
[01:56:28.817 --> 01:56:34.579]  Well, you know, I put all my videos up there for free, and then millions of people watched it, and my bank account disappeared.
[01:56:35.699 --> 01:56:41.221]  So, again, PrisonPlanet.TV, my friends.
[01:56:41.601 --> 01:56:42.982]  Go sign up today.
[01:56:44.022 --> 01:56:47.463]  I've also made ten films, carry a bunch of other videos, and great books.
[01:56:47.883 --> 01:56:56.606]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to peruse the site, to decide what videos you want to watch, to watch lengthy free clips of the films.
[01:56:58.107 --> 01:57:04.208]  A Matrix of Evil, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 2000, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:57:04.768 --> 01:57:06.589]  All of these are great videos you need to have.
[01:57:06.769 --> 01:57:10.970]  They're $25.95 apiece, all over 2 hours.
[01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.430]  $20 apiece when you order 3 or more.
[01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:22.072]  That's an $18 discount on the 3-tape special, $24 discount on the 4-tape special, a $30 discount on the 5-tape special, $36 discount, boom, boom, boom.
[01:57:22.092 --> 01:57:23.572]  You're starting to get the idea here.
[01:57:24.361 --> 01:57:28.823]  I got books from $5 to $26 because they're 800 pages long.
[01:57:29.364 --> 01:57:32.125]  All this great research on the best materials I found out there.

[01:57:38.527 --> 01:57:42.290]  Or call toll-free, my friends, and the operators can answer your questions and take your order.

[01:57:44.993 --> 01:57:53.900]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:57:55.402 --> 01:57:58.684]  You're not authorized to make copies of the videos I carry that other people have made.
[01:57:59.345 --> 01:58:02.127]  But you are authorized to make copies of the 10 films I've produced.
[01:58:02.508 --> 01:58:04.029]  So go to InfoWars.com
[01:58:05.012 --> 01:58:05.913]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:06.013 --> 01:58:06.794]  Order the videos.
[01:58:06.934 --> 01:58:07.554]  Make copies.
[01:58:07.634 --> 01:58:09.256]  Give them to your neighbors, your friends, your family.
[01:58:09.596 --> 01:58:10.757]  Start waking people up.
[01:58:10.937 --> 01:58:16.082]  Evil cannot triumph or even thrive or get moving like it has if we stand up.
[01:58:16.182 --> 01:58:18.004]  So you're in the gap, folks.
[01:58:18.044 --> 01:58:18.865]  You're in the trenches.
[01:58:19.845 --> 01:58:21.347]  You're right beside me, not behind me.
[01:58:21.917 --> 01:58:26.061]  1-888-253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:58:26.301 --> 01:58:27.162]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:27.182 --> 01:58:27.542]  Stay with us.
[01:58:27.562 --> 01:58:28.383]  Third hour, straight ahead.
[01:58:44.787 --> 01:58:47.771]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:58:48.132 --> 01:58:56.943]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:58:57.284 --> 01:59:01.970]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:59:02.410 --> 01:59:09.138]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:59:09.539 --> 01:59:21.313]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:59:21.793 --> 01:59:26.255]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:59:26.415 --> 01:59:29.016]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:29.076 --> 01:59:30.717]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:59:30.757 --> 01:59:31.937]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:59:32.017 --> 01:59:33.478]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:59:33.498 --> 01:59:34.538]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:34.638 --> 01:59:35.259]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.144 --> 01:59:52.225]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:52.925 --> 01:59:54.026]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.686 --> 01:59:55.486]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.247 --> 01:59:57.167]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.187 --> 02:00:01.750]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.010 --> 02:00:06.112]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.973 --> 02:00:19.979]  In the Tech Monday section of our local paper here in Austin, Texas, they're watching on the street, even in the pool, surveillance cameras are everywhere, and it goes into
[02:00:20.999 --> 02:00:29.626]  One of the cameras says, Secure Cam 5000, and it gets into, well it's really for your safety, and yes, you know the cameras are in the school bathrooms, but it's good.
[02:00:29.706 --> 02:00:33.049]  It's kind of upsets us, but it's really best.
[02:00:33.169 --> 02:00:36.492]  I'm getting used to it.
[02:00:36.532 --> 02:00:37.713]  We'll get into that.
[02:00:37.873 --> 02:00:44.599]  Also, Kerry is related to King Harold, and just a bunch of other teenagers, in this third hour of Global Transmission.
[02:00:45.419 --> 02:00:49.743]  Thank you so much for joining us, but let's leap back into your calls.
[02:00:50.563 --> 02:00:57.045]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Minnesota.
[02:00:57.105 --> 02:00:57.825]  Mark, go ahead.
[02:00:58.445 --> 02:00:59.386]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:00:59.606 --> 02:00:59.786]  Good.
[02:00:59.806 --> 02:01:10.549]  I wanted to talk about this Chalibi thing, which I'm sure was staged as a Powell so-called dispute with his press aide.
[02:01:10.569 --> 02:01:13.910]  By the way, everybody thought that was real.
[02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:20.312]  I found it kind of odd that we could hear everything his press aide was saying, as though there was a mic that was specifically designed to capture everything she was saying.
[02:01:20.802 --> 02:01:45.212]  And then afterwards, everybody's like, ooh, Paul is so good, he's so honest, he's such a great... And then the next day, he's out praising George Bush, saying a bunch of sick L's, so yeah, it's that classic good cop, and then... Well, and you know, this quote raid on Shalibi's house, he's the head of the council, I mean, he's their hired torture master, he's, quote, Bush's favorite person to run it, he is the convicted bank robber, and yeah, he's jockeying to be the opposition.
[02:01:45.292 --> 02:01:48.853]  Yeah, in fact, I found an Associated Press article which basically
[02:01:49.725 --> 02:01:53.987]  Uh, I mean, it basically mirrors exactly what you were saying, and this is from Saturday.
[02:01:54.007 --> 02:01:55.727]  This is what it says.
[02:01:55.807 --> 02:01:57.968]  It says, uh, forsaken by his longtime U.S.
[02:01:58.048 --> 02:01:58.509]  backers.
[02:01:58.529 --> 02:02:01.330]  I don't know, I guess we should put forsaken in quotation marks.
[02:02:02.150 --> 02:02:07.552]  Umad Chalibi is casting out his outsider image and reinventing himself as a man of the people.
[02:02:07.892 --> 02:02:12.374]  Trying to rally fellow Shiite Muslims, uh, to his side to ensure political survival.
[02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:18.217]  And then it quotes him, that's what he said, quote, I only act from an Iraqi national perspective, close quote.
[02:02:18.498 --> 02:02:28.731]  He told the TV interviewer Friday, a day after Iraqi police backed by American soldiers raided his Baghdad home and offices, quote, I consider what happened to me as a medal from the people of Iraq.
[02:02:29.172 --> 02:02:30.654]  It is the final piece of evidence
[02:02:31.092 --> 02:02:34.013]  That discredits rumors that I am with the Americans, close quote.
[02:02:34.293 --> 02:02:41.495]  Oh no, I'm just publicly at the State of the Union, publicly hired to go in and take over and torture and to stage the, you know, the cutting down of the statue.
[02:02:41.935 --> 02:02:48.437]  I'm good, see, I'm a good... And the same thing with Bush and Kerry, these cousins having this, this staged fight with each other.
[02:02:48.717 --> 02:02:50.358]  Email me that article, I'll post it.
[02:02:50.398 --> 02:03:00.841]  But this is like, so serious, because, of course, we can't know what to believe, but if what they're saying about the guy is true, and this guy, very well, well he's simultaneously on the Pentagon payroll,
[02:03:01.334 --> 02:03:03.276]  Maybe responsible for U.S.
[02:03:03.317 --> 02:03:03.917]  troop deaths.
[02:03:04.358 --> 02:03:17.234]  And then of course now they're, and this I find a little difficult to believe, they're trying to say that, well it's possible that the whole genesis of the war actually started with radical Iranian mullahs, because they fed us phony intelligence through Chalibi,
[02:03:18.082 --> 02:03:21.344]  That this whole war was, you know, doing the bidding for Iran.
[02:03:21.364 --> 02:03:22.364]  See, it's their fault.
[02:03:23.425 --> 02:03:24.205]  I did see that.
[02:03:24.225 --> 02:03:25.286]  It's like, come on.
[02:03:25.306 --> 02:03:29.328]  And on top of this, again, this is Cheney, this is them positioning him.
[02:03:29.608 --> 02:03:30.789]  He's the outsider.
[02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:38.993]  But another thing that I haven't really noticed being asked is saying that Iran may have used the INC to collect secret U.S.
[02:03:39.033 --> 02:03:39.853]  military intelligence.
[02:03:40.053 --> 02:03:40.634]  But wait a minute.
[02:03:41.034 --> 02:03:42.534]  If Iran is collecting secret U.S.
[02:03:42.554 --> 02:03:43.415]  military intelligence,
[02:03:44.216 --> 02:03:45.157]  from the INC.
[02:03:45.517 --> 02:03:49.180]  Well, who's feeding the secret military intelligence to the INC and why?
[02:03:50.221 --> 02:03:52.063]  And again, that's the Iraqi Council.
[02:03:52.103 --> 02:03:54.024]  I mean, none of this really makes sense.
[02:03:54.044 --> 02:03:55.065]  Well, I mean, look.
[02:03:55.105 --> 02:03:55.685]  Hold on a second.
[02:03:56.026 --> 02:04:00.349]  They're telling us that the second council is appointed, but that's freedom.
[02:04:01.230 --> 02:04:01.450]  Yeah.
[02:04:01.890 --> 02:04:11.578]  So I'm going to come to your town and I'm going to come in with tanks and helicopters and, you know, and then I'm going to say I'm appointing ten people to be your rulers.
[02:04:11.618 --> 02:04:12.479]  This is democracy.
[02:04:14.099 --> 02:04:15.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:21.424]  Let's just appoint the dictatorship and call it... You shouldn't be mad about Chalibi.
[02:04:21.725 --> 02:04:22.565]  Thanks for the call.
[02:04:22.605 --> 02:04:38.897]  I mean, Chalibi's an admitted torture master, bank robber, at the State of the Union, hired by Bush to run things, and now he has to position himself with the badge of honor that... By the way, the raid on his house, just some troops came up and took a computer and... Man, he's really... They're on to him.
[02:04:38.937 --> 02:04:39.938]  He's a man of the people.
[02:04:40.318 --> 02:04:41.920]  We can trust him now in Iraq.
[02:04:47.705 --> 02:04:53.190]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:57.853]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:04:58.094 --> 02:05:05.119]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:11.605]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:11.765 --> 02:05:12.966]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:13.306 --> 02:05:16.247]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:16.407 --> 02:05:18.368]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:18.728 --> 02:05:25.971]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:05:26.271 --> 02:05:29.632]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:05:34.858 --> 02:05:38.022]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:05:49.404 --> 02:05:50.684]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:05:50.904 --> 02:05:56.646]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:05:56.906 --> 02:06:02.168]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:06:02.448 --> 02:06:06.569]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:06:06.769 --> 02:06:10.574]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:06:10.814 --> 02:06:15.460]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:21.808]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:06:21.868 --> 02:06:23.691]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:06:51.318 --> 02:06:57.520]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:07:39.696 --> 02:07:41.076]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:07:41.116 --> 02:07:54.600]  Let me go over some more news, then we'll go back to Howard and Tom and Brett and Tom and many, many others.
[02:08:07.091 --> 02:08:08.712]  That are patiently holding.
[02:08:10.554 --> 02:08:16.918]  This is out of National Public Television in Oslo, Norway.
[02:08:16.938 --> 02:08:21.942]  And it says, Kerry is related to King Harold.
[02:08:23.163 --> 02:08:29.868]  The Democratic President candidate, John Kerry, is related to King Harold of Norway.
[02:08:29.908 --> 02:08:35.332]  And according to one expert, royal relation ensures that he will win the election this fall.
[02:08:35.412 --> 02:08:36.373]  Statistically, that's true.
[02:08:38.132 --> 02:08:42.653]  Because they say he has more royal blood than Bush, but that's not clear.
[02:08:43.813 --> 02:08:57.697]  Not only did Kerry live a couple of years in Oslo during his youth, he is also related with the Norwegian King according to Harold Brooks Baker, director of Burke's Pedigree, the Bible of the European royal families.
[02:08:59.557 --> 02:09:02.598]  He is not only related to the Queen of England on his
[02:09:03.326 --> 02:09:12.636]  Mommyside, but also to the Queen of the Netherlands, the founders of the Bilderberg Group, the Queen of Denmark, and the King of Norway.
[02:09:13.857 --> 02:09:20.745]  And other European royal families, stated Brooks Baker, even Princess Diana was a relative.
[02:09:22.279 --> 02:09:29.641]  And it is precisely Kerry's connection to the royal families that may ensure him the victory in this fall's presidential election.
[02:09:30.001 --> 02:09:41.463]  According to Brooks Baker, according to the expert, the candidate who has the most royal blood pulsing through his veins has won every American presidential election since the time of George Washington.
[02:09:42.844 --> 02:09:47.064]  Also, President George W. Bush is a blue bud, but not as much as Kerry.
[02:09:47.104 --> 02:09:48.805]  Bush is a descendant of Edward I of England.
[02:09:50.242 --> 02:09:57.489]  But on his mother's side, Kerry is a direct descendant of John Winthorpe, the first governor of the Bay Colony in Massachusetts.
[02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:58.590]  Uh-uh, Bush.
[02:09:58.791 --> 02:09:59.571]  Both of them are that.
[02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:00.572]  That's been in the news.
[02:10:01.033 --> 02:10:08.100]  And though this Winthorpe connection, Kerry has more royal and aristocratic relatives than Bush's, Brooks Baker stated.
[02:10:09.011 --> 02:10:13.293]  Even if many think that Bush is going to win, it would bet my money on Kerry.
[02:10:13.313 --> 02:10:15.234]  The royal rule always works.
[02:10:15.274 --> 02:10:18.716]  The candidate who has the most royal connections always wins.
[02:10:19.176 --> 02:10:26.700]  It is the most particular pattern, and this can't be accidental, Brooks Baker said, according to the news.
[02:10:27.741 --> 02:10:30.202]  And Reuters and AP have also reported on this.
[02:10:30.222 --> 02:10:30.963]  They've checked into it.
[02:10:31.343 --> 02:10:32.043]  It is true!
[02:10:33.544 --> 02:10:37.346]  The royals check their own pedigree, according to this Brooks Bible.
[02:10:39.003 --> 02:10:40.584]  So, nice little tidbit.
[02:10:40.604 --> 02:10:42.764]  Of course, I didn't mention here that they're cousins.
[02:10:42.864 --> 02:10:46.746]  First it was 16th cousins, then 14th cousins, then 9th cousins, then 5th cousins.
[02:10:47.246 --> 02:10:52.768]  Because there's so many relations, so many angles, they're cousins at multiple different levels.
[02:10:52.828 --> 02:10:55.809]  Because it's all one Illuminati bloodline.
[02:10:58.270 --> 02:11:00.631]  And very, very scary at that.
[02:11:01.289 --> 02:11:11.093]  So that's on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com if you would like to check it out.
[02:11:11.193 --> 02:11:15.135]  White House guilty of breaking propaganda law.
[02:11:16.496 --> 02:11:19.437]  The Bush administration was guilty of spreading covert propaganda.
[02:11:19.457 --> 02:11:20.978]  This is the Scotsman.
[02:11:21.658 --> 02:11:26.880]  Through a series of ready-made television news packages it sent to broadcasters as U.S.
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:28.341]  government watchdog has concluded.
[02:11:28.948 --> 02:11:44.173]  This particular buy was $70,000,000 in fake newscasts aired across the country as, well, basically public service announces, but they don't announce what it is, little 30-minute packages.
[02:11:44.873 --> 02:11:46.134]  They're really infomercials.
[02:11:46.694 --> 02:11:49.595]  I've seen them air in Austin before this even broke, so that is really weird.
[02:11:50.521 --> 02:12:02.465]  Uh, and it says, uh, the running mate news item praised as, uh, a new law signed by the President, George Bush, in December, which the White House has said will make it easier for elderly citizens to obtain prescribed medicines.
[02:12:02.585 --> 02:12:04.445]  One of the newscasts was about that.
[02:12:04.785 --> 02:12:06.206]  Now wonderful Bush was giving it to them.
[02:12:06.606 --> 02:12:12.588]  Some of the features contain pictures of Bush receiving a standing ovation from a crowd as he signed the Medicare law.
[02:12:12.608 --> 02:12:13.628]  Remember this came out a few months ago?
[02:12:14.904 --> 02:12:24.507]  The packages were produced by the Department of Health and Human Services, but news viewers would have no way of knowing they were watching a government production story rather than an independent news report.
[02:12:24.968 --> 02:12:30.469]  Because they said on the show, I'm Jane Doe, reporting from Washington.
[02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:39.072]  The GAO said that the adverts broke laws permitting public money being used for propaganda purposes.
[02:12:39.252 --> 02:12:42.614]  It added that viewers would believe that the information came from a non-
[02:12:44.364 --> 02:12:57.696]  Ralph Nader, government source, or neutral party, in a report the body said the packages were not strictly factual news stories and contained notable omissions and weaknesses.
[02:12:58.077 --> 02:13:00.439]  That's the General Accounting Office for you.
[02:13:00.979 --> 02:13:05.964]  And again, I remember about six months ago, and this came out about two months ago, sitting down one morning,
[02:13:07.883 --> 02:13:16.453]  In a nauseated fashion, eating breakfast, flipping through the channels just to see what they're up to, and seeing the end of this weird newscast going, Bush cares and helps the people.
[02:13:16.493 --> 02:13:17.815]  He got a standing ovation.
[02:13:18.402 --> 02:13:20.084]  He's helping everyone.
[02:13:20.565 --> 02:13:24.088]  Oh, and Homeland Security is doing what it takes to keep you safe.
[02:13:24.269 --> 02:13:25.850]  And I was like, what is this?
[02:13:26.091 --> 02:13:28.273]  So I watched till the end.
[02:13:28.293 --> 02:13:30.195]  I caught it like the last ten minutes.
[02:13:30.816 --> 02:13:32.398]  And I was going, what is this?
[02:13:32.938 --> 02:13:36.783]  And then it just said, you know, we're a civil rights news agency from Washington.
[02:13:37.283 --> 02:13:37.664]  Thank you.
[02:13:40.098 --> 02:13:41.839]  Wow, that's interesting.
[02:13:42.459 --> 02:13:43.500]  Private news agency.
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:44.601]  Man, it's really getting bad.
[02:13:45.061 --> 02:13:46.642]  But no, it was just paid for.
[02:13:47.142 --> 02:13:51.404]  You see, they don't just have product placement where, hmm, I love Taco Bell.
[02:13:51.424 --> 02:13:53.846]  You know, the guy says in the movie and they get a million bucks to say that.
[02:13:54.546 --> 02:14:02.951]  That show The Apprentice got something like $34 million from one of the big airlines just to mention the airline during the course of the show.
[02:14:04.582 --> 02:14:14.229]  The government spends hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on this each year.
[02:14:14.269 --> 02:14:16.510]  It really started accelerating under Clinton.
[02:14:17.091 --> 02:14:27.658]  It has proliferated, exploded, metastasized, mushroomed, blossomed, spread, whatever you want to call it now under Lord Bush.
[02:14:28.953 --> 02:14:36.959]  I mean, there was one program I saw that was $80 million just to pay to have Hollywood insert lines of text in scripts.
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:39.021]  And it's worse with TV.
[02:14:39.481 --> 02:14:42.544]  The movies don't have as much of it as television shows do.
[02:14:43.024 --> 02:14:50.289]  And by the way, under federal law, if it's a government operation, the company has to give them double, you know, buy one, get one free.
[02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:54.473]  So $80 million is really $160 million worth.
[02:14:54.633 --> 02:14:57.235]  And that's just one program, one AP article I saw.
[02:14:59.114 --> 02:15:00.836]  Every few weeks I see another one of these programs.
[02:15:00.896 --> 02:15:04.219]  This one is $70 million dollars.
[02:15:04.239 --> 02:15:06.882]  So the buy seems to be $70, $80, $100 million.
[02:15:08.344 --> 02:15:11.907]  Nice media buy!
[02:15:12.328 --> 02:15:13.629]  But there's no discussion of it.
[02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:15.791]  You tell the average person.
[02:15:16.131 --> 02:15:19.475]  A lot of local radio stations here in Austin do this.
[02:15:20.276 --> 02:15:24.397]  I mean, I'll spend every couple days, maybe five minutes, plugging a water filter.
[02:15:24.417 --> 02:15:29.019]  And I tell you, this is a sponsored, and we're having them up, I believe in it, this is an ad.
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:33.341]  You know we're advertising something to you.
[02:15:34.841 --> 02:15:43.504]  But I'll listen to local radio and the national shows, and they'll announce, say locally, Austin Air Force is a group that cares about your environment.
[02:15:43.544 --> 02:15:44.284]  Get involved.
[02:15:44.764 --> 02:15:47.265]  Call for emissions testing in our city.
[02:15:49.941 --> 02:15:51.222]  This is a great new thing.
[02:15:51.282 --> 02:15:51.902]  It's wonderful.
[02:15:51.962 --> 02:15:52.482]  They care.
[02:15:52.522 --> 02:15:58.644]  And it's done as a news piece on these local news channels, talk radio news channels, but it's not a news piece.
[02:15:59.144 --> 02:16:01.365]  They're being paid.
[02:16:02.145 --> 02:16:04.726]  They're paying to have these announcements.
[02:16:04.746 --> 02:16:06.307]  They're paying for the content.
[02:16:08.568 --> 02:16:09.988]  And they're federally funded.
[02:16:11.609 --> 02:16:14.610]  So there's no telling how many of these groups are out there.
[02:16:15.823 --> 02:16:20.144]  Let's go ahead and go to some calls and we'll go back and the news gets even crazier, folks.
[02:16:20.965 --> 02:16:24.506]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Howard in West Virginia.
[02:16:24.566 --> 02:16:28.567]  Howard, welcome to the airwaves, sir.
[02:16:29.327 --> 02:16:29.948]  If you're still there.
[02:16:30.688 --> 02:16:31.248]  Perhaps not.
[02:16:31.688 --> 02:16:32.108]  Alright.
[02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:37.090]  Stephanie, let's go ahead now and go to Tom in Maryland.
[02:16:37.130 --> 02:16:37.750]  Tom, you there?
[02:16:37.770 --> 02:16:41.271]  Who is this?
[02:16:44.694 --> 02:16:47.056]  Okay, this is the caller from West Virginia?
[02:16:47.136 --> 02:16:47.916]  Right, right.
[02:16:48.176 --> 02:16:48.617]  Okay.
[02:16:48.957 --> 02:16:49.457]  Okay, buddy.
[02:16:49.977 --> 02:16:56.682]  Alex, I've been listening to you for five years now and attending meetings with Pastor Bush Paul for five years.
[02:16:56.862 --> 02:16:57.162]  Great!
[02:16:57.482 --> 02:16:58.102]  He's my brother.
[02:16:58.783 --> 02:16:59.703]  The best man on earth.
[02:17:00.724 --> 02:17:02.385]  You're getting close though, old buddy.
[02:17:03.045 --> 02:17:05.547]  But I heard you say a while ago not to thank you for nothing.
[02:17:05.987 --> 02:17:07.328]  I understand where you're coming from.
[02:17:07.968 --> 02:17:13.052]  But regardless, if we just had 70 more like you, we'd have it finished.
[02:17:14.226 --> 02:17:19.149]  But Alex, I'm a UMWA miner, an underground coal miner.
[02:17:19.570 --> 02:17:21.431]  That's right, West Virginia coal miner.
[02:17:21.491 --> 02:17:23.792]  Twenty-five years underground before I got hurt.
[02:17:24.373 --> 02:17:26.874]  And Alex, I worked in Union Mines for a long time.
[02:17:27.195 --> 02:17:29.616]  And I listen to you and I have faith in your program.
[02:17:29.716 --> 02:17:31.978]  I have faith in the Joyce and Dave and all you people.
[02:17:32.078 --> 02:17:36.000]  You are honestly my friends, my brothers, my sisters, and I'll meet you in heaven.
[02:17:39.002 --> 02:17:39.803]  I have an idea.
[02:17:40.303 --> 02:17:47.009]  Now, whenever we had conflict with our union companies, or our non-union companies, we had a grievance set up.
[02:17:47.569 --> 02:17:50.151]  Same as our contracts have a grievance set up, right?
[02:17:50.912 --> 02:17:53.394]  Under the Bill of Rights, that the people could call a grievance?
[02:17:53.574 --> 02:17:54.715]  Yeah, that's in the First Amendment.
[02:17:54.795 --> 02:17:56.316]  Right, right, absolutely.
[02:17:57.457 --> 02:18:00.740]  Alex, somehow, someway, now, I'm serious.
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:05.364]  I've been writing here for three and a half hours worth of papers of the questions I want to ask you.
[02:18:05.564 --> 02:18:07.946]  But, Alex, can we have a head count?
[02:18:09.488 --> 02:18:10.588]  How can we have a headcount?
[02:18:12.069 --> 02:18:14.710]  I'm not talking people that listen and talk.
[02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:17.491]  I'm talking serious people.
[02:18:18.191 --> 02:18:19.812]  People like you and I know real well.
[02:18:20.372 --> 02:18:21.953]  How can we ever have a headcount?
[02:18:21.993 --> 02:18:23.553]  We need a headcount, Alex.
[02:18:23.673 --> 02:18:24.854]  What's the point of a headcount?
[02:18:25.114 --> 02:18:30.616]  A headcount is to know how many people that will go for a grievance to our government
[02:18:31.940 --> 02:18:36.825]  Well, those are done via petitions and recalls all the time, and that's a huge process, and it's a good process.
[02:18:36.845 --> 02:18:39.808]  It's a good process, but now listen, they're after our money, right?
[02:18:40.689 --> 02:18:42.411]  Other than our Bill of Rights.
[02:18:42.591 --> 02:18:46.455]  Yeah, 40 million people are refusing to file now as part of a protest.
[02:18:46.575 --> 02:18:47.616]  Okay, that's great.
[02:18:47.796 --> 02:18:50.479]  That's real good, and I'm in on that.
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:52.181]  And my wife's in on that.
[02:18:52.837 --> 02:18:58.903]  Alex, if we would just stop working as we did in the mines, I've traveled from state to state as high as I can.
[02:18:58.943 --> 02:19:08.992]  That's why they're bringing in all the illegal aliens to drive down the wages, where even if you don't want to strike, they can threaten you with this massive unskilled labor.
[02:19:09.252 --> 02:19:10.733]  Okay, that's where I'm coming from.
[02:19:10.773 --> 02:19:11.814]  That's my grievance.
[02:19:12.435 --> 02:19:18.000]  My federal government was set up to protect my borders and to supply my mail, right?
[02:19:18.826 --> 02:19:19.106]  Yes.
[02:19:19.426 --> 02:19:20.887]  Is that what they were originally set up for?
[02:19:20.907 --> 02:19:21.948]  And to coin the money, yes.
[02:19:22.148 --> 02:19:25.930]  And then they turned out over to the level 13 banks.
[02:19:26.250 --> 02:19:26.550]  Right.
[02:19:27.331 --> 02:19:38.217]  But Alex, if we can shut their money situation down, here, there's more people following you than you really think that there is in this area down here.
[02:19:38.237 --> 02:19:39.617]  Well, I don't want people following me.
[02:19:39.657 --> 02:19:40.538]  I want them right beside me.
[02:19:40.598 --> 02:19:40.978]  Stay there.
[02:19:40.998 --> 02:19:42.159]  I'll let you finish up on the other side.
[02:19:42.179 --> 02:19:42.579]  We'll be back.
[02:19:45.382 --> 02:19:48.864]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.

[02:20:17.277 --> 02:20:21.059]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:21.419 --> 02:20:23.281]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.

[02:21:44.102 --> 02:21:48.003]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:21:48.223 --> 02:22:00.486]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:22:00.926 --> 02:22:01.326]  The U.S.
[02:22:01.366 --> 02:22:06.948]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:22:07.348 --> 02:22:09.549]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%,
[02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:12.469]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:22:12.509 --> 02:22:15.370]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:22:15.470 --> 02:22:21.492]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:22:21.933 --> 02:22:25.274]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[02:22:25.374 --> 02:22:31.696]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[02:22:32.276 --> 02:22:36.300]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:38.562]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:39.362 --> 02:22:42.005]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:43.466 --> 02:22:46.228]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[02:22:46.649 --> 02:22:47.730]  Are you running out of ideas?
[02:22:48.190 --> 02:22:48.811]  Out of time?
[02:22:49.291 --> 02:22:52.474]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[02:22:53.157 --> 02:22:55.979]  Well, think of a song written especially for them.

[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:30.924]  Birthday coming soon?
[02:23:31.345 --> 02:23:32.045]  Anniversary?
[02:23:32.526 --> 02:23:33.247]  Wedding perhaps?
[02:23:33.847 --> 02:23:34.809]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[02:23:35.369 --> 02:23:39.334]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[02:23:39.774 --> 02:23:42.077]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[02:23:51.335 --> 02:23:55.777]  Earlier, I got into the new World ID Card being put in.
[02:23:56.617 --> 02:24:00.419]  When you read the headline, it's Virtual Borders, but it's a World ID Card.
[02:24:00.439 --> 02:24:05.781]  I want to talk about how our presidents are these royal family members.
[02:24:07.362 --> 02:24:11.384]  This clique of organized crime syndicates running our planet.
[02:24:11.404 --> 02:24:16.506]  I want to get into top doctors, forensic specialists in the U.S.
[02:24:17.535 --> 02:24:19.297]  I don't know how to do this, but I'm really interested.
[02:24:19.377 --> 02:24:20.878]  I love my nation and I love my grandchildren.
[02:24:20.918 --> 02:24:21.438]  I love my kids.
[02:24:44.963 --> 02:24:45.503]  I don't think so.
[02:25:08.581 --> 02:25:16.106]  There must be some concentration put on this until we can know each other, where we're at, and where we're staying.
[02:25:16.147 --> 02:25:17.107]  Harry, thanks for the call.
[02:25:17.147 --> 02:25:19.309]  Let me just try to comment on what you're saying.
[02:25:20.830 --> 02:25:22.371]  It's all part of a process.
[02:25:22.491 --> 02:25:26.394]  There isn't one magic silver bullet that's going to fix all our problems.
[02:25:26.414 --> 02:25:33.059]  If we could get rid of the New World Order today, there'd still be sociopathic evil people who want to dominate and control others.
[02:25:33.988 --> 02:25:43.676]  And you're always going to have a gullible population that doesn't want to admit that there's evil in the world, and who just wants to stupidly keep stumbling down the primrose path.
[02:25:45.057 --> 02:25:51.162]  But look, the government had all these taxes in place thirty years ago, but things weren't this bad.
[02:25:52.924 --> 02:26:01.591]  Because people wouldn't put up with cameras in school bathrooms, and cameras in the state parks in Michigan, and face scanners in the airports,
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:06.601]  We've been incrementally conditioned and made to think we don't have any power.
[02:26:06.641 --> 02:26:13.004]  So it's about all of us saying no, all of us speaking out, all of us taking action in small ways every day.
[02:26:13.564 --> 02:26:17.286]  The journey of a thousand miles really does start with a single step.
[02:26:18.046 --> 02:26:22.868]  I started walking in my fight against the New World Order, really running in my fight against the New World Order ten years ago.
[02:26:23.568 --> 02:26:25.409]  And you know, I've traveled 500 miles.
[02:26:26.829 --> 02:26:31.071]  So, I understand that we can win this thing, but we've got a long way to go.
[02:26:32.103 --> 02:26:34.505]  But, no, it's a good idea what you are saying.
[02:26:34.525 --> 02:26:39.249]  I mean, it's good to get involved and to figure out ways to put pressure on these people.
[02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:41.011]  Tom in Maryland.
[02:26:41.051 --> 02:26:41.811]  Tom, go ahead.
[02:26:42.592 --> 02:26:43.333]  Hello, Alex.
[02:26:43.413 --> 02:26:44.894]  It's great to talk to you again.
[02:26:45.074 --> 02:26:45.795]  Good to talk to you.
[02:26:45.975 --> 02:26:55.343]  And be on your show, and every time I call, I plug your films because I think they're well worth having everyone.
[02:26:55.703 --> 02:26:58.766]  I had a conversation recently with somebody, and I was basically
[02:27:01.042 --> 02:27:05.843]  I've been told, if it helps save my kids' lives, it was about microchips.
[02:27:05.903 --> 02:27:26.327]  I know a lady who has a son that's going to be in first grade next year, and I just made a comment, yeah, and you'll probably need a thumb scan or a face scan to get your lunch, and I had also heard from her that she was a bit of a Sean Hannity fan, and I told her about Sean Hannity, how he couldn't even
[02:27:27.312 --> 02:27:34.794]  Get the words out about how great he thought the microchips were on your video, because he was like, uh... It's so great!
[02:27:34.874 --> 02:27:35.694]  Every child needs it!
[02:27:35.754 --> 02:27:36.654]  Oh, we gotta get it now!
[02:27:36.774 --> 02:27:37.334]  Oh, the chips!
[02:27:37.374 --> 02:27:38.174]  Everyone needs chips!
[02:27:39.175 --> 02:27:43.695]  Exactly, but listen, you'll probably find this funny and also disturbing.
[02:27:44.516 --> 02:27:51.217]  When the conversation went there, and I said, Sean Hannity is a Judas goat, and he's just there to lead the sheep to the slaughter,
[02:27:51.943 --> 02:27:53.544]  And to promote these things.
[02:27:53.624 --> 02:27:54.644]  I was like, that's not going to help.
[02:27:55.044 --> 02:27:57.725]  I got run out.
[02:27:57.745 --> 02:28:01.847]  I was at a mechanic's house and I've known the mechanic all my life and he wasn't around.
[02:28:01.867 --> 02:28:12.431]  I was talking to his wife and she ran me off saying, you know, I don't even want this kind of a conversation because these are the type of people who believe everything that's on the boob tube.
[02:28:13.191 --> 02:28:15.752]  And it's very unfortunate.
[02:28:15.772 --> 02:28:17.152]  So she literally
[02:28:19.418 --> 02:28:22.961]  Ran you out, but she told you, if chips keep them safe, it's good.
[02:28:22.981 --> 02:28:26.464]  The problem is, is the people that want you to have the chips are bad, folks.
[02:28:26.645 --> 02:28:27.225]  Exactly.
[02:28:27.946 --> 02:28:35.513]  If you had told her that they wanted to put chips in us five years ago, she'd say that you were a nut, she'd never do it, it's evil, but you're crazy to think it's going on.
[02:28:35.813 --> 02:28:39.056]  Now that it's out in the open, oh, it's good and we all need it.
[02:28:39.296 --> 02:28:44.301]  Yes, and several months ago, I had a conversation with this same woman's father, and
[02:28:45.552 --> 02:29:00.386]  He basically believed anything and everything about... That's off the news and 9-1-1, and I told them about your films and how great they are, and I was like, you know, you can't disprove anything he said.
[02:29:00.546 --> 02:29:03.989]  You know, you can't disprove it.
[02:29:04.009 --> 02:29:07.372]  You can try from now to your dying day.
[02:29:07.772 --> 02:29:09.654]  You're not going to disprove any of this stuff.
[02:29:11.170 --> 02:29:26.742]  Uh, basically that's all I wanted to say, that, you know, I had an experience with somebody recently and they believe everything that's on the, that the idiot box tells them, and they don't want to be bothered with any, uh, uh, negative side that could come from it, basically.
[02:29:26.902 --> 02:29:29.704]  Hey, they feel like they're part of the power system.
[02:29:29.744 --> 02:29:33.687]  They associate their power with Lord Bush, just like Democrats did with Clinton.
[02:29:35.769 --> 02:29:36.669]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.150 --> 02:29:38.671]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.660 --> 02:29:42.421]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:45.823 --> 02:29:51.045]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:29:51.205 --> 02:29:59.289]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:29:59.549 --> 02:30:06.592]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:30:07.553 --> 02:30:14.037]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:30:14.217 --> 02:30:19.301]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:30:19.441 --> 02:30:28.307]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:30:28.587 --> 02:30:32.090]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:51.243]  Just once, I'd like to clean my car's leather upholstery without sliding across the seat on every turn.
[02:30:51.923 --> 02:30:56.306]  Just once, I'd like to get a beautiful shine without a slick, oily resin that attracts dust and dirt.
[02:30:56.907 --> 02:30:59.889]  Introducing, just once, the amazing non-slip protectant.
[02:31:00.541 --> 02:31:04.625]  Just Once cleans, protects, and shines vinyl, leather, rubber, and hard plastics.
[02:31:05.126 --> 02:31:13.334]  Its patented formula eliminates slippery surfaces, provides optimum UV protection against the sun's harmful rays, and outlasts those other less effective formulas.
[02:31:13.955 --> 02:31:18.739]  Just Once is excellent for use on cars, trucks, motorcycles, boats, truck bedliners, and RVs.
[02:31:19.580 --> 02:31:29.606]  You can use it on dashboard, leather and vinyl interiors, motorcycle seats and tires, floor mats, convertible tops, brake pedals or anywhere you need ultimate protection including leather furniture, shoes and purses.
[02:31:30.186 --> 02:31:33.789]  Just Once has been used commercially nationwide and now it's available to you.
[02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:40.973]  To order call 888-578-6623 or visit JustOnce.com on the World Wide Web.
[02:31:41.333 --> 02:31:42.894]  That's JustOnce.com
[02:31:44.830 --> 02:31:47.654]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:31:47.774 --> 02:31:48.615]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:31:48.735 --> 02:31:52.040]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:57.888]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:31:58.028 --> 02:32:01.072]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:32:01.312 --> 02:32:05.594]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:32:05.774 --> 02:32:07.675]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[02:32:07.795 --> 02:32:14.858]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:32:15.058 --> 02:32:17.519]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:32:17.819 --> 02:32:20.500]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[02:32:20.660 --> 02:32:22.161]  Only this time, it changed my life.
[02:32:22.441 --> 02:32:24.181]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[02:32:24.282 --> 02:32:26.382]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[02:32:26.562 --> 02:32:29.023]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[02:32:29.063 --> 02:32:31.764]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[02:32:31.944 --> 02:32:32.485]  Side effects?
[02:32:32.645 --> 02:32:34.926]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[02:32:35.086 --> 02:32:36.566]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[02:32:36.646 --> 02:32:36.986]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[02:32:37.006 --> 02:32:38.267]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:32:38.327 --> 02:32:38.867]  It worked for me.
[02:32:48.809 --> 02:32:51.291]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:32:51.811 --> 02:32:57.176]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:32:57.256 --> 02:33:10.826]  Alright, Johnny Cash, the late, great Johnny Cash bringing us back in live.
[02:33:12.427 --> 02:33:13.368]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:13.408 --> 02:33:15.810]  We're going to talk to John of Vermont, John of Illinois, and
[02:33:16.633 --> 02:33:18.474]  Jim in Michigan and Larry in Washington.
[02:33:18.514 --> 02:33:20.936]  A couple other people here before we end this transmission.
[02:33:21.396 --> 02:33:23.698]  We've got plenty of time, about 26 minutes left.
[02:33:24.919 --> 02:33:30.823]  But before I do that, let me launch into a big stack of important news that we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:33:30.843 --> 02:33:41.930]  I want to recap a couple top stories concerning top scientists, forensics experts saying that the Merck videos are fake.
[02:33:43.171 --> 02:33:46.313]  The new Patriot Act that we must absolutely have for our safety.
[02:33:47.372 --> 02:33:49.652]  Let's kill America to save America, basically.
[02:33:50.073 --> 02:33:51.813]  But I want to get into Verichip.
[02:33:51.973 --> 02:33:59.374]  Remember a couple of months ago, I had one of the Verichip distributors on about, oh, you're going to have to have it globally to buy and sell.
[02:33:59.414 --> 02:34:00.494]  That's the corporate plan.
[02:34:00.534 --> 02:34:06.335]  And you'll have to have it to own a firearm to get into places.
[02:34:06.456 --> 02:34:09.136]  And the entire Italian government's about to take it.
[02:34:09.176 --> 02:34:11.276]  And the troops are going to have to have it.
[02:34:11.396 --> 02:34:14.397]  And well, now here it is in a press release from Applied Digital.
[02:34:15.265 --> 02:34:18.387]  An RFID tracker chip, and they want the police to have to take this.
[02:34:18.407 --> 02:34:22.189]  And then after the cops have been made to do it, why, they're gonna have no problem enforcing you.
[02:34:22.449 --> 02:34:23.349]  Hey, I took it!
[02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:25.871]  Come on, be a body snacker with us.
[02:34:26.011 --> 02:34:26.591]  Lay down.
[02:34:27.031 --> 02:34:27.452]  Sleep.
[02:34:27.772 --> 02:34:29.673]  Lay down next to the green pod.
[02:34:29.693 --> 02:34:31.474]  You'll be better in the morning.
[02:34:31.494 --> 02:34:33.595]  You'll be one of us, yes.
[02:34:33.975 --> 02:34:35.236]  Yes, it's all normal.
[02:34:35.416 --> 02:34:37.917]  We're openly talking about everyone taking chips now.
[02:34:38.217 --> 02:34:40.258]  If it makes the children safe, it's good.
[02:34:40.278 --> 02:34:42.900]  I mean, this is hell out of control it's gotten!
[02:34:44.111 --> 02:34:49.233]  Again, these yuppies said none of this existed five years ago when I was reading Pentagon documents!
[02:34:50.454 --> 02:34:50.974]  On air!
[02:34:51.454 --> 02:34:54.315]  Federation of American Scientists documents where they said this!
[02:34:54.615 --> 02:34:57.696]  You'll be forced to have a chip in your brain!
[02:34:58.397 --> 02:35:00.277]  These are public federal plans!
[02:35:01.478 --> 02:35:02.338]  For the decades to come.
[02:35:02.358 --> 02:35:03.679]  You go, they'll never do that, that's crazy.
[02:35:04.099 --> 02:35:07.760]  Oh, everything they wanted 30 years ago they called for is now in place.
[02:35:08.761 --> 02:35:09.061]  Okay?
[02:35:09.958 --> 02:35:11.259]  And everything's accelerating.
[02:35:11.679 --> 02:35:14.001]  And they talk about ways to brainwash you to accept it.
[02:35:16.223 --> 02:35:19.945]  And I'm still weird to say it's going on because I'm against it.
[02:35:20.005 --> 02:35:24.629]  If I said it was good, you would suddenly agree that it existed and that we needed to do it.
[02:35:24.669 --> 02:35:27.151]  But I'm still weird for talking about something that's public.
[02:35:27.871 --> 02:35:29.612]  You starting to get the insanity of that?
[02:35:29.632 --> 02:35:38.679]  I mean, how do you sit there, government agents and the rest of you, and keep doing what you're doing when you know that we're in a science fiction movie nightmare every day?
[02:35:44.071 --> 02:35:45.051]  Oh, I've got a headache now.
[02:35:45.071 --> 02:35:47.554]  It just makes me really mad.
[02:35:47.594 --> 02:35:52.758]  Before I get into all this news and your calls, I did want to talk briefly about Michael Moore.
[02:35:53.759 --> 02:35:59.204]  All over talk radio, all over the country now, New York Post, now I'm told other newspapers.
[02:36:00.505 --> 02:36:02.787]  I haven't had time to look it up because I learned this morning of it.
[02:36:04.268 --> 02:36:10.233]  And I was running out the door, but they're saying Michael Moore ripped me off with 9-11 on the road to tyranny.
[02:36:11.987 --> 02:36:12.828]  I don't want to say that.
[02:36:13.248 --> 02:36:16.270]  I mean, it'd be easy to go, yeah, he ripped me off, he ripped me off.
[02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:17.750]  That's right, that's right.
[02:36:17.770 --> 02:36:25.775]  And we do know Michael Moore's gotten the videos, and I've been out in Hollywood, and I know they're all aware of my films, and I'm not going to go into any more than what I've said.
[02:36:27.296 --> 02:36:32.398]  But it's like there have been 50 TV shows and 5 movies made about the Kennedy assassination.
[02:36:33.319 --> 02:36:38.762]  I mean, it's a public event, and if he has a lot of the facts in his film that I have, that isn't a rip-off.
[02:36:40.220 --> 02:36:50.705]  I mean, you know, if I make a movie about Seabiscuit in five years, which I'm not, the point is, if I did, it wouldn't be a rip-off of that film if I did it my own style.
[02:36:50.825 --> 02:36:52.005]  And he certainly does that.
[02:36:52.045 --> 02:36:55.547]  I haven't seen it, but I've talked to those that have and that have reviewed it.
[02:36:56.967 --> 02:36:58.248]  His solutions are horrible.
[02:36:58.708 --> 02:37:00.209]  His solution is we'd have the U.N.
[02:37:00.229 --> 02:37:01.329]  come occupy America.
[02:37:01.629 --> 02:37:07.752]  And I said years ago on this show, not bragging, just facts, that they're going to let the truth of 9-11 come out in Europe,
[02:37:08.777 --> 02:37:12.860]  And then say, oh, see, America's bad, but not point out that Bush is a puppet of Europe.
[02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:14.922]  See, it's more of this good cop, bad cop.
[02:37:16.203 --> 02:37:19.805]  And that's what his book and his film basically calls for, to rein in the evil Americans.
[02:37:20.646 --> 02:37:27.051]  So he tells you the truth about 9-11, only a small portion of it, but some damning evidence that's public.
[02:37:28.011 --> 02:37:32.114]  And then his answer is world government to stop the evil, rogue America.
[02:37:34.016 --> 02:37:35.717]  So I wouldn't support this film.
[02:37:36.337 --> 02:37:37.598]  I do plan to see it myself.
[02:37:39.540 --> 02:37:43.201]  You know, watch it if you want to, but I wouldn't promote it as God's honest truth.
[02:37:44.621 --> 02:37:54.763]  If you want to see something hardcore, something made two years and, what, four months ago is when we released this film.
[02:37:54.863 --> 02:37:58.483]  We released it in the first month of 2002.
[02:37:58.523 --> 02:38:01.924]  9-11, the road to tyranny.
[02:38:05.224 --> 02:38:06.304]  It stood the test of time.
[02:38:06.344 --> 02:38:07.125]  It's all accurate.
[02:38:07.725 --> 02:38:09.305]  I think I got one date wrong in there.
[02:38:11.142 --> 02:38:39.476]  uh... and and it's amazing who trained al-qaeda, who al-qaeda is, how they carry out terror but my film goes a step further who carried out oklahoma city who carried out the first world trade center we give you the history of governments doing this why they do it we give you the big picture and then of course there's masters of terror uh... that's been out for a little over a year and a half part two of nine eleven the road to tyranny which is over two hours long and then there's my book dissent and tyranny out for about a year and a half
[02:38:40.476 --> 02:38:46.061]  And, uh, this stuff is more pertinent today than when I first put it out, and more documented, more information.
[02:38:46.081 --> 02:38:50.746]  I mean, like I say in my film that 144 of the Bin Laden family got flown out.
[02:38:51.266 --> 02:38:53.208]  Well, that's because I had it out of the Associated Press.
[02:38:53.688 --> 02:38:55.050]  Well, that's a mistake in the film.
[02:38:55.610 --> 02:39:01.075]  Judicial Watch, two months ago, got, through a FOIA request, the actual documents as 160.
[02:39:03.218 --> 02:39:07.340]  In the film, I say 6,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda got flown out to safety by the U.S.
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:08.341]  government in Afghanistan.
[02:39:08.701 --> 02:39:10.442]  I'm sorry, that was the facts at the time.
[02:39:10.742 --> 02:39:11.622]  Now it's worse.
[02:39:12.163 --> 02:39:15.364]  It was 8,000 confirmed and admitted by the government, but they say it was an accident.
[02:39:15.825 --> 02:39:17.405]  So there is stuff like that in the film.
[02:39:17.425 --> 02:39:21.367]  It's actually worse than what the film says, but, you know.
[02:39:21.808 --> 02:39:25.930]  You need to get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[02:39:26.250 --> 02:39:27.991]  Gets into 9-11, some of the latest developments.
[02:39:28.811 --> 02:39:30.232]  Matrix of Evil does as well.
[02:39:31.531 --> 02:39:34.774]  My book, Descent into Tyranny, Paul Watson's book, went out for about eight months.
[02:39:34.934 --> 02:39:37.416]  Very pertinent, very up-to-date, very powerful.
[02:39:37.836 --> 02:39:40.839]  Order Out of Chaos, elite-sponsored terror in the New World Order.
[02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:43.621]  So, order Order Out of Chaos.
[02:39:44.182 --> 02:39:48.505]  Go to nfowars.com or prisonplanet.com
[02:39:49.841 --> 02:39:50.322]  And order it!
[02:39:50.362 --> 02:39:55.386]  We've also got George Humphrey's 9-11 book on CD or cassette.
[02:39:55.526 --> 02:39:56.807]  Great way to wake people up.
[02:39:57.188 --> 02:40:00.090]  Everybody's got time to listen to a CD stuck in traffic.
[02:40:00.511 --> 02:40:01.772]  Three hour CD set.
[02:40:02.052 --> 02:40:04.234]  They can listen to it in a week driving to and from work.
[02:40:05.623 --> 02:40:06.683]  That's a great gift to give.
[02:40:06.743 --> 02:40:08.404]  It even comes with three free booklets.
[02:40:09.344 --> 02:40:13.705]  You know, the text of the CD, so you can go over at your leisure time with the documents.
[02:40:14.365 --> 02:40:15.065]  We offer that.
[02:40:15.085 --> 02:40:21.466]  We've got Eric Huffman's videos on VHS and DVD, painful deceptions in the book, painful questions.
[02:40:21.927 --> 02:40:26.788]  It focuses in on the impossibility of the buildings, the bombs in the buildings, the Pentagon, all that.
[02:40:27.648 --> 02:40:29.948]  That's a whole film just covering one aspect.
[02:40:29.968 --> 02:40:32.689]  I mean, that's how sloppy this job was.
[02:40:34.129 --> 02:40:41.952]  So again, go to infowars.com or presentplanet.com if you want a real 9-11 film, not a U.N.
[02:40:42.772 --> 02:40:45.213]  propaganda orgy like Mr. Moore's.
[02:40:47.934 --> 02:40:48.354]  Okay?
[02:40:48.434 --> 02:40:49.294]  It's really that simple.
[02:40:49.954 --> 02:40:51.735]  And no, Mr. Moore didn't rip me off.
[02:40:53.215 --> 02:40:53.596]  Okay?
[02:40:53.656 --> 02:40:55.176]  Yes, we have evidence he's seen the film.
[02:40:55.236 --> 02:40:56.496]  Yes, he got a lot of ideas from it.
[02:40:56.897 --> 02:40:57.417]  So what?
[02:40:57.777 --> 02:41:00.038]  I hope you buy my video and go make your own film.
[02:41:00.058 --> 02:41:00.938]  I hope all of you do.
[02:41:02.463 --> 02:41:04.385]  There's no monopoly on the truth here.
[02:41:04.925 --> 02:41:06.066]  I don't care about money.
[02:41:06.086 --> 02:41:07.366]  The New York Post pointed that out.
[02:41:08.407 --> 02:41:13.971]  For about two years, we have Road to Tyranny for free, all two and a half hours on the website.
[02:41:14.471 --> 02:41:18.614]  But when I started writing four and five thousand dollar checks a month for bandwidth, I couldn't do it anymore.
[02:41:18.834 --> 02:41:19.554]  So I'm sorry.
[02:41:19.774 --> 02:41:21.015]  But other people host it for free.
[02:41:21.415 --> 02:41:22.136]  Good for them!
[02:41:23.757 --> 02:41:26.759]  So, but we do need your support, and I do hope you'll order the videos.
[02:41:28.180 --> 02:41:29.801]  Toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:41:29.821 --> 02:41:38.384]  That's 888-253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704 or infowars.com or presentplanet.com to order.
[02:41:38.404 --> 02:41:40.305]  The problem with Moore is this.
[02:41:40.325 --> 02:41:41.346]  Let's say Bush is Hitler.
[02:41:56.644 --> 02:41:58.684]  And then who Moore is supporting is Stalin.
[02:41:59.284 --> 02:42:06.486]  So Moore tells you how bad Hitler is, which is true, and then you run out of Germany into Stalin's hands.
[02:42:07.426 --> 02:42:09.546]  So that's the analogy on Moore.
[02:42:09.726 --> 02:42:10.546]  Oh, America's evil.
[02:42:10.646 --> 02:42:11.367]  Oh, it's a rogue.
[02:42:11.387 --> 02:42:13.147]  Oh, it might be involved in the attack.
[02:42:13.167 --> 02:42:14.207]  Certainly had prior knowledge.
[02:42:14.607 --> 02:42:15.767]  Oh, it's a fraud in Iraq.
[02:42:15.867 --> 02:42:16.468]  Oh, but the U.N.
[02:42:16.488 --> 02:42:18.268]  should occupy America and save us from it!
[02:42:18.608 --> 02:42:21.248]  So, out of the frying pan into the furnace.
[02:42:22.309 --> 02:42:24.789]  Out of the frying pan into the brick oven.
[02:42:26.099 --> 02:42:28.100]  Okay, so that's the problem.
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:30.921]  You can tell the truth but then get false solutions.
[02:42:31.001 --> 02:42:36.584]  You ever seen the cartoon where the cat's chasing the Tom and Jerry?
[02:42:38.565 --> 02:42:39.985]  Tom, isn't the cat's name Tom?
[02:42:40.025 --> 02:42:41.486]  He's chasing the mouse.
[02:42:42.375 --> 02:42:47.741]  And then Tom, finally in one episode, teams up with another cat who acts like his mouth is a mouse hole.
[02:42:48.121 --> 02:42:51.685]  And then Tom chases Jerry into the other cat's mouth.
[02:42:51.745 --> 02:42:52.806]  I mean, that's all this is.
[02:42:53.146 --> 02:42:54.308]  It's like two wolves.
[02:42:54.668 --> 02:42:55.509]  A pack of wolves.
[02:42:55.529 --> 02:43:01.175]  One will run up, act like it's after the deer, run in the wrong direction into the hands of the five waiting wolves.
[02:43:01.395 --> 02:43:04.218]  I mean, this is predatory herding activity.
[02:43:04.518 --> 02:43:05.179]  This is intentional.
[02:43:05.979 --> 02:43:10.241]  It's all public!
[02:43:10.521 --> 02:43:11.901]  That's how I have the answers.
[02:43:12.181 --> 02:43:13.562]  That's how I predict the future.
[02:43:13.782 --> 02:43:15.262]  That's how I know what I'm talking about.
[02:43:15.502 --> 02:43:19.023]  And if you don't learn this basic science now, it's over.
[02:43:19.363 --> 02:43:20.484]  I'm nothing special!
[02:43:21.924 --> 02:43:23.144]  Stick to what you can prove.
[02:43:23.264 --> 02:43:24.125]  Stick to history.
[02:43:24.405 --> 02:43:25.285]  Stick to the facts.
[02:43:25.445 --> 02:43:26.585]  Learn their paradigms.
[02:43:26.846 --> 02:43:28.026]  And we can defeat them!
[02:43:28.486 --> 02:43:30.447]  If we don't defeat them, they're going to kill 85% of us.
[02:43:30.467 --> 02:43:31.507]  That's their own public documents.
[02:43:35.111 --> 02:43:36.652]  I want to go to your calls here in just a minute.
[02:43:37.473 --> 02:43:39.074]  But let me just shotgun through news.
[02:43:39.314 --> 02:43:40.395]  Shotgun through the news.
[02:43:40.975 --> 02:43:43.277]  Some of the news I haven't covered and we'll take calls quickly.
[02:43:43.877 --> 02:43:44.858]  So, be ready.
[02:43:45.719 --> 02:43:55.906]  Verichip Corporation enters into a memorandum of understanding for the development of firearms user authorization system smart gun using Verichip RFID technology.
[02:43:58.428 --> 02:43:59.809]  And again, this came out months and months ago.
[02:44:01.115 --> 02:44:02.796]  You tell your neighbor this, they laugh at you.
[02:44:02.836 --> 02:44:05.037]  They have plans to make police take these.
[02:44:07.318 --> 02:44:20.544]  An advanced technology development company announced today its wholly owned subsidiary Verichip Corporation has entered into a memorandum of understanding with FM Manufacturing, a leading gun manufacturer, to develop its first in the world of firearms.
[02:44:20.584 --> 02:44:27.988]  The team's objective is to integrate user authorization system for firearms using Verichip RFID technology.
[02:44:29.736 --> 02:44:36.158]  Located in Columbia, South Carolina, the firearms manufacturer produces small arms for military and police forces, as well as the commercial market.
[02:44:36.418 --> 02:44:40.159]  The company is engaged in R&D efforts to study the development of various techniques.
[02:44:40.820 --> 02:44:45.421]  Commonly referred to, as understood, in industry and the private sector as smart gun.
[02:44:45.741 --> 02:44:51.743]  And again, the government has passed a law to make people start adopting smart guns in the next few years.
[02:44:51.783 --> 02:44:52.723]  And this is getting serious.
[02:44:53.624 --> 02:44:54.364]  So we got that.
[02:44:55.264 --> 02:44:57.585]  If you want to save a life, you have to have a chip.
[02:44:58.533 --> 02:45:01.616]  Again, Barcelona nightclubbers get the chip customers.
[02:45:01.656 --> 02:45:02.837]  This is out of the register.
[02:45:04.698 --> 02:45:07.221]  Just came out a few days ago on the 19th.
[02:45:07.301 --> 02:45:08.742]  We reported on it again months ago.
[02:45:08.762 --> 02:45:13.266]  And it says that they're putting the chips on them to get in the nightclub.
[02:45:14.907 --> 02:45:16.889]  Child ID system makes its mark.
[02:45:16.989 --> 02:45:22.454]  Boston Globe Adventure is Tom Burrell's middle name.
[02:45:23.220 --> 02:45:31.807]  Ever since the four-year-old could walk, he has wandered off at shopping malls, the San Diego Zoo, and his big sister's school band recital.
[02:45:33.008 --> 02:45:44.797]  And it says, the answer, the boy was among an estimated 14,000 children who participated yesterday in a massive seven-state identification drive organized by the Masonic Child Identification Program, or CHIP.
[02:45:45.450 --> 02:45:51.851]  And admittedly, this program is to prepare them to be microchipped by first being enrolled with a face scan and a thumb scan.
[02:45:52.072 --> 02:45:53.492]  And the program's called Chipped.
[02:45:54.372 --> 02:45:55.292]  And who are the Masons?
[02:45:55.332 --> 02:45:59.213]  Well, you saw the ritual where they blew the guy's head off up in Long Island a few months ago.
[02:45:59.233 --> 02:46:02.954]  And they found guillotines and black coffins and a black altar.
[02:46:04.314 --> 02:46:07.015]  If anybody else was doing that in their basements, they'd be arrested.
[02:46:07.075 --> 02:46:11.296]  But, oh, this is the people that help with the databases of our children.
[02:46:12.839 --> 02:46:19.700]  In addition to being fingerprinted, the children were videotaped, answered questions about their family, favorite hiding spots and places they'd like to go after school.
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:26.102]  Dentists and dental hygienists volunteered their time taking teeth impressions and saliva samples for DNA analysis from each child.
[02:46:26.762 --> 02:46:27.582]  Ah ha ha!
[02:46:28.662 --> 02:46:34.623]  And boy, if David Rockefeller needs a kidney and you got a match, somebody's gonna have a problem.
[02:46:35.244 --> 02:46:39.244]  All of the identification materials are kept by the parents to ensure privacy.
[02:46:40.405 --> 02:46:41.865]  Not true, they keep the swabs.
[02:46:42.503 --> 02:46:44.804]  At least in the past cases, we've had the people on promoting this.
[02:46:45.245 --> 02:46:47.546]  We've got almost 190,000 Massachusetts kids.
[02:46:47.966 --> 02:46:49.907]  We should pass that number today, he said.
[02:46:50.608 --> 02:46:52.128]  One day alone, they should pass it.
[02:46:52.509 --> 02:46:54.090]  When they stopped counting, it was 140,000.
[02:46:55.971 --> 02:46:57.972]  Britain becomes less neighborly.
[02:46:58.032 --> 02:47:00.213]  This is the problem with America and the world.
[02:47:00.876 --> 02:47:07.281]  Fewer than half of the people trust their neighbors enough to ask them for help in an emergency, highlighting how distant Britons are becoming.
[02:47:07.301 --> 02:47:07.981]  That's by design.
[02:47:08.522 --> 02:47:14.066]  1 in 20 people admit they did not know how their neighbors were, and 1 in 6 only saw them in passion.
[02:47:14.676 --> 02:47:19.661]  Despite the findings, most Britons believed that stronger neighborhoods would help cut crime.
[02:47:19.702 --> 02:47:23.105]  But they've imported so many illegal aliens, that's so crime-ridden.
[02:47:23.125 --> 02:47:25.568]  I talk to people in England all the time, they can't talk to their neighbors.
[02:47:25.948 --> 02:47:35.759]  Research among 1,000 people from Lloyds TSB Insurance found that 58% believed their neighbors were becoming more distant.
[02:47:36.388 --> 02:47:37.391]  That's how they want you.
[02:47:37.852 --> 02:47:42.424]  Not talking to your neighbors, not asking questions, being a cowardly little person in a box.
[02:47:42.504 --> 02:47:43.326]  More news coming up.
[02:47:43.386 --> 02:47:44.549]  Right now, let's go to these calls.
[02:47:45.645 --> 02:47:47.286]  Let's talk to John in Vermont.
[02:47:47.346 --> 02:47:48.146]  John, go ahead.
[02:47:48.346 --> 02:47:49.507]  Yeah, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:47:49.527 --> 02:47:49.647]  Good.
[02:47:49.667 --> 02:47:50.547]  Nice to talk to you.
[02:47:50.947 --> 02:47:52.968]  Boy, I've been listening to you for a couple of years.
[02:47:53.048 --> 02:47:55.309]  I really like your show and everything that you're doing.
[02:47:55.449 --> 02:47:55.769]  Thank you.
[02:47:55.909 --> 02:47:58.230]  I really agree with your getting the word out.
[02:47:58.610 --> 02:48:01.652]  You're making an impression for all of us listeners out there.
[02:48:02.172 --> 02:48:10.155]  But I'll tell you, one of the things that really happens to us out here listening to you every day and every night and going to your website all the time
[02:48:10.655 --> 02:48:11.075]  Well, thank you.
[02:48:26.929 --> 02:48:28.250]  You're putting out the facts.
[02:48:28.310 --> 02:48:29.530]  You don't make stuff up.
[02:48:29.851 --> 02:48:32.852]  Occasionally, you do get into theorizing, but that's okay.
[02:48:32.872 --> 02:48:35.633]  You've got to put your... Well, no, I will state what I think's going on.
[02:48:35.673 --> 02:48:37.414]  It's like I said, I think this Berg thing's fake.
[02:48:37.434 --> 02:48:40.636]  I think he's CIA, and then all this evidence pours out.
[02:48:43.353 --> 02:48:47.736]  I agree with what you're doing.
[02:48:48.817 --> 02:48:56.162]  One of the things I think we really need to do is, like you said, you're getting 20 million hits a month right now on your website.
[02:48:56.303 --> 02:48:57.283]  That's phenomenal.
[02:48:57.704 --> 02:49:02.187]  Now, we know that 20 million hits isn't 20 million people.
[02:49:02.567 --> 02:49:06.470]  Maybe it's one or two million people in the country are hitting your site every month, right?
[02:49:08.027 --> 02:49:09.468]  It's a little more than that, but yeah.
[02:49:09.668 --> 02:49:10.548]  Yeah, but that's great.
[02:49:10.929 --> 02:49:13.130]  You know, so look at what we got here.
[02:49:13.470 --> 02:49:20.254]  We got a million or two, three, four million people in the United States who know what's going on now.
[02:49:20.994 --> 02:49:26.077]  Now, your other caller earlier, Howard, said, you know, let's do something.
[02:49:26.457 --> 02:49:32.640]  You know what we could do with three or four million people a month that would really be good for all of us listeners out there?
[02:49:33.121 --> 02:49:35.562]  Let's buy some congressmen of our own.
[02:49:36.923 --> 02:49:41.185]  They chase after money because they have to get re-elected every two years.
[02:49:41.566 --> 02:49:46.348]  A lot of congressmen are in rural areas where the population isn't that great.
[02:49:46.768 --> 02:49:53.091]  Let's target ten of them and give them $200,000 a year, a buck or two from each person.
[02:49:53.111 --> 02:49:58.814]  Well, if I created a political pact where they've written the laws, then I couldn't talk about politics.
[02:49:59.154 --> 02:50:00.294]  Where's our First Amendment?
[02:50:00.815 --> 02:50:03.196]  At the same time, I don't want to be some
[02:50:03.726 --> 02:50:07.347]  Big Graham Poobah leader, directing political PACs and money.
[02:50:07.547 --> 02:50:10.228]  I know, but you could disassociate yourself from the PAC.
[02:50:10.288 --> 02:50:13.469]  It could be a separate organization, a 501c3.
[02:50:13.509 --> 02:50:14.850]  You could be distanced from it.
[02:50:15.330 --> 02:50:19.852]  But at the same time, you could talk about it on your website.
[02:50:19.932 --> 02:50:21.332]  Well look, all of that's a good idea.
[02:50:21.372 --> 02:50:25.694]  We've got gun groups out there doing that and others, pro-Len Wright groups and others.
[02:50:25.734 --> 02:50:29.155]  But the big problem here is the electronic voting machines.
[02:50:29.858 --> 02:50:33.222]  We need a pact just to fund stopping that.
[02:50:33.242 --> 02:50:34.203]  Do you agree?
[02:50:34.223 --> 02:50:37.807]  Yeah, I do agree, but I think what we need is... Hey, you got great ideas.
[02:50:37.887 --> 02:50:38.949]  Unfortunately, I'm almost out of time.
[02:50:38.969 --> 02:50:39.629]  Got some more callers.
[02:50:39.930 --> 02:50:40.671]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:50:40.691 --> 02:50:41.451]  We'll talk more about it.
[02:50:41.672 --> 02:50:42.613]  Final segment coming up.
[02:50:47.293 --> 02:50:47.633]  I think so.
[02:51:02.538 --> 02:51:03.199]  We're good to go!
[02:51:32.077 --> 02:51:35.158]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.318 --> 02:51:41.320]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:44.881 --> 02:51:49.202]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:51:49.402 --> 02:51:53.764]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:51:56.001 --> 02:51:58.363]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:51:58.403 --> 02:52:01.206]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:52:01.527 --> 02:52:05.751]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:52:05.811 --> 02:52:12.738]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:52:12.878 --> 02:52:14.880]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:25.562]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:52:25.862 --> 02:52:31.243]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:52:31.743 --> 02:52:35.644]  Visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:52:35.664 --> 02:52:36.104]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:52:36.124 --> 02:52:37.964]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:52:44.440 --> 02:52:49.043]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[02:52:49.243 --> 02:52:53.686]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[02:52:53.866 --> 02:53:07.895]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:53:08.115 --> 02:53:27.324]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[02:53:27.525 --> 02:53:31.146]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[02:53:31.306 --> 02:53:32.527]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[02:53:32.707 --> 02:53:33.968]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[02:53:36.809 --> 02:53:40.532]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:53:41.153 --> 02:53:42.994]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:53:46.937 --> 02:53:52.082]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:52.762 --> 02:53:55.124]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:53:56.325 --> 02:54:03.071]  One of the first things the Empire did when they took over Iraq was ban the statistical gathering of the numbers of deaths.
[02:54:03.895 --> 02:54:07.057]  Cholera, cancer, gunshot wound, everything.
[02:54:07.097 --> 02:54:07.978]  Statistics ended.
[02:54:08.738 --> 02:54:09.619]  They got a problem, though.
[02:54:09.639 --> 02:54:23.688]  They blew up this wedding party with up to 45 people dying, and there's even video of the wedding taking place, of a few people shooting guns in the air, and then later the jets coming and bombing and killing and dead children all over the place and dead women.
[02:54:24.068 --> 02:54:27.691]  Then our government said, oh no, it was an Al-Qaeda camp, but then they have the video of all this happening.
[02:54:28.771 --> 02:54:29.712]  Just out of control.
[02:54:30.888 --> 02:54:32.490]  Let's jam a few final calls in here.
[02:54:32.810 --> 02:54:36.153]  Jim and then Larry and then Chad.
[02:54:36.273 --> 02:54:37.054]  You each get a minute.
[02:54:37.354 --> 02:54:38.135]  Jim, go ahead.
[02:54:38.535 --> 02:54:40.857]  Yeah, I'll run by these fast, Alex.
[02:54:40.937 --> 02:54:43.279]  Charlemagne didn't force his people.
[02:54:43.319 --> 02:54:46.462]  They all saw a sign in the sky, In Hoc Signo Ventis.
[02:54:46.802 --> 02:54:50.065]  By this sign, you shall conquer, and they became Christians.
[02:54:50.426 --> 02:54:56.111]  The Alta Vendita is the plan to destroy the Catholic Church and all vestige of Christianity.
[02:54:56.744 --> 02:54:57.225]  We're good.
[02:55:16.351 --> 02:55:23.455]  He's in jail, and this is the kind of thing they do to somebody that should be relegated with Washington.
[02:55:23.875 --> 02:55:27.137]  Alright, listen, I appreciate the call, Jim.
[02:55:28.078 --> 02:55:31.900]  I guess he's responding earlier to somebody saying the Catholic Church was founded by the Illuminati.
[02:55:32.820 --> 02:55:35.221]  Let's go ahead and talk to Larry in Washington.
[02:55:35.261 --> 02:55:36.022]  Larry, go ahead.
[02:55:36.782 --> 02:55:37.843]  Yeah, good man, Alex.
[02:55:38.783 --> 02:55:39.223]  Well, thank you.
[02:55:39.243 --> 02:55:40.365]  Go ahead.
[02:55:40.765 --> 02:55:50.795]  The only discrepancy, I'm a student of the Second World War, and you're always referring to the German or Hitler as the bad.
[02:55:52.176 --> 02:55:58.562]  And Hitler's Eastern Front, he saw the 23 million people that Stalin and Lenin had just killed.
[02:56:01.295 --> 02:56:10.119]  And I wish you had used a KGB instead of... Well, sir, in my analogy earlier, I mean, I said Hitler was evil and so was Stalin.
[02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:11.160]  I know.
[02:56:11.180 --> 02:56:12.660]  I mean, Hitler was into the occult.
[02:56:12.700 --> 02:56:14.201]  Hitler did kill a bunch of people.
[02:56:14.501 --> 02:56:16.963]  Well, that's another thing.
[02:56:17.143 --> 02:56:19.644]  We won't even go into the six million.
[02:56:20.224 --> 02:56:23.506]  But you always bring it out as Hitler is the
[02:56:26.289 --> 02:56:27.953]  The devil personified.
[02:56:28.333 --> 02:56:34.046]  When compared to him, to the financial powers that back both him and Russia...
[02:56:35.757 --> 02:56:36.817]  He's nothing.
[02:56:36.977 --> 02:56:39.979]  Well, we do talk about the masters that created Hitler and others.
[02:56:40.379 --> 02:56:43.260]  And they financed the Bolshevik Revolution, too.
[02:56:43.540 --> 02:56:45.101]  Which killed a lot more people than Hitler.
[02:56:45.301 --> 02:56:47.381]  Look, Hitler was evil, but others were even more evil.
[02:56:47.441 --> 02:56:48.142]  I agree with you.
[02:56:48.162 --> 02:56:48.782]  Thanks for the call.
[02:56:49.502 --> 02:56:51.203]  Hitler was into the occult, a bunch of stuff.
[02:56:51.223 --> 02:56:51.963]  It was bad news.
[02:56:52.843 --> 02:56:55.164]  Chad, where are you calling us from?
[02:56:55.684 --> 02:56:56.445]  Boulder, Colorado.
[02:56:56.685 --> 02:56:57.265]  Welcome, sir.
[02:56:57.285 --> 02:56:58.746]  How are you doing?
[02:57:00.066 --> 02:57:00.466]  Fine.
[02:57:00.566 --> 02:57:01.747]  Hey, I have a question for you.
[02:57:02.127 --> 02:57:04.408]  I went to CU, the college here in town.
[02:57:05.589 --> 02:57:10.132]  The Council of World Affairs that they had, and they had a bunch of speakers and such.
[02:57:10.552 --> 02:57:14.915]  There was a guy named Leonard Schlain, who I went to his conference, and an awesome speaker.
[02:57:14.935 --> 02:57:16.176]  I actually ended up buying his book.
[02:57:16.216 --> 02:57:21.640]  And he made the comment, he was like, I'm probably the only person that went to Bohemian Grove and to Burning Man this year.
[02:57:22.020 --> 02:57:24.342]  And the comment just kind of threw me for a loop.
[02:57:24.522 --> 02:57:30.926]  I don't know, the guy was a very inspirational speaker on my kind of women's sexuality and human evolution.
[02:57:30.946 --> 02:57:32.767]  The guy's a brain surgeon, a really smart guy.
[02:57:32.807 --> 02:57:35.289]  He seemed like a very big part of the intellectual community.
[02:57:36.110 --> 02:57:44.592]  And just for him to make a comment on that, I didn't get to talk to him afterwards or anything, but it was definitely kind of like, I don't know, have you ever heard of this guy?
[02:57:44.692 --> 02:57:49.593]  No, I haven't, but the Bohemian Grove is a very wicked place, so is Skull and Bones.
[02:57:50.253 --> 02:57:55.235]  These people are slick, smooth talkers, so better watch out.
[02:57:56.115 --> 02:57:57.475]  I don't know this particular individual.
[02:57:58.075 --> 02:57:58.675]  Okay, right on.
[02:57:58.996 --> 02:57:59.816]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:57:59.856 --> 02:58:00.596]  I'm out of time.
[02:58:01.394 --> 02:58:03.956]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:58:04.016 --> 02:58:07.958]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time, nearing the day.
[02:58:07.978 --> 02:58:16.803]  And thank you for joining us for this May 24, 2004 edition of the Alex Jones Show.

[02:58:29.768 --> 02:58:30.048]  All right.
[02:58:30.109 --> 02:58:30.929]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:58:30.969 --> 02:58:32.270]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:58:32.310 --> 02:58:32.770]  God bless.
[02:58:36.132 --> 02:58:36.732]  Hello, folks.
[02:58:36.832 --> 02:58:37.753]  Alex Jones here.
[02:58:37.873 --> 02:58:41.995]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:58:42.115 --> 02:58:44.996]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:58:45.076 --> 02:58:51.760]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:58:51.960 --> 02:58:54.945]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:58:55.185 --> 02:58:57.549]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:58:57.709 --> 02:59:07.844]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:59:08.044 --> 02:59:17.169]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:59:17.329 --> 02:59:23.352]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:59:23.372 --> 02:59:23.632]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:59:23.652 --> 02:59:24.853]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
