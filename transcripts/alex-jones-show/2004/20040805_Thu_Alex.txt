[00:00:05.726 --> 00:00:06.366]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:08.088]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:09.909]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:11.370]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.931]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.718 --> 00:00:17.359]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:21.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:35.423]  Well, believe me, you do not want to miss this Thursday edition, the fifth day of August 2004.
[00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:41.924]  We've got one of those guests coming up that we can't announce until they're on the air,
[00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:45.233]  And it'll be for obvious reasons.
[00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:55.038]  Once you hear them on the broadcast, it's just... The more I research this particular story, the more insane it got.
[00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:05.723]  And also, I have another big news article that I can break here, a story, and I can do that now.
[00:01:05.924 --> 00:01:10.786]  I got internal documents out of Hilton Hotels.
[00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:12.667]  Won't tell you what city.
[00:01:14.544 --> 00:01:22.409]  And they tell their employees to search your car secretly if they can, and to get your face on camera, and to go through your stuff.
[00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:25.912]  Just amazing!
[00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:31.816]  You just... Everybody that goes to the hotel, we're just gonna search them, on their cars, out in the parking lot, and they don't know it.
[00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:42.983]  Look for contraband, look for... look for terrorists, look for... This country is being totally warped, and believe me, these corporations only do things in unison,
[00:01:43.843 --> 00:01:48.728]  I'll bet you my bottom dollar, a whole bunch of the other big chains are doing it too.
[00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.293]  So that's another issue we'll get into.
[00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.435]  It's just incredible.
[00:01:56.176 --> 00:01:58.298]  But this other situation is even bigger.
[00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.823]  Much, much, much bigger, and that is in 30 minutes.
[00:02:03.483 --> 00:02:07.107]  Meanwhile, I got up this morning and learned that Michael Medved
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.883]  A very oily, ferret-like liberal calling himself a conservative, a wannabe Hollywood creature, movie reviewer.
[00:02:20.184 --> 00:02:31.027]  This guy is basically saying that people that talk about 9-11, the Rotary, people that hand out flyers to it, the film, you know, we all need to be questioned by the Secret Service, we need to be
[00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:34.524]  We're basically bad people.
[00:02:34.945 --> 00:02:42.012]  Of course, it doesn't go as far as Michael Savage, who says, arrest anyone who disagrees with the government, because by disagreeing with the government, you aid the terrorists.
[00:02:42.352 --> 00:02:56.727]  By the way, the Democrat Deputy Attorney General, what was it, a year and a half ago, out in California, when the Iraq War was starting, said in the, I'll never forget this, in the
[00:02:57.902 --> 00:03:04.925]  Oakland Tribune, that we may ban all protests, because protest aids terrorists by stopping the war.
[00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:08.667]  I mean, that was the Democrat saying that, Mr. Calhoun.
[00:03:10.448 --> 00:03:24.214]  So, this is the new freedom, where you get arrested at the shopping mall for having a Peace on Earth shirt, where veterans who want to march in a public parade for peace get beat up by the police,
[00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:35.109]  This is America, where you can't stand with a rebel flag on the side of the street in Mobile, Alabama, without having the police knock you on the head.
[00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.211]  I mean, it doesn't matter what you believe in or what you're up to, you're having your freedoms taken!
[00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:50.915]  And it doesn't scare me that I've got big guns of the neocons firing at me on a routine basis, from Lord Hannity to
[00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:53.475]  Lord Medved to the rest of them.
[00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:57.338]  I love my family in this country, and I'm not going to back down from this filth.
[00:03:58.178 --> 00:03:58.398]  Ever.
[00:03:59.139 --> 00:03:59.619]  And they are.
[00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.782]  They are the scum of the earth, my friends.
[00:04:05.323 --> 00:04:06.204]  It's disgusting.
[00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:07.445]  It makes me want to puke.
[00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:11.107]  I am not going to play what Medved said, because it's his broadcast, it's his show.
[00:04:11.387 --> 00:04:13.689]  Even though it's about me, fair use, I can analyze it.
[00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.233]  I'm not going to give this bug-eyed trash the time of day.
[00:04:19.313 --> 00:04:21.034]  But we will have Paul Watson on.
[00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:29.693]  Fresh back from his sabbatical, for about 5-10 minutes of the next segment, who has listened to it and analyzed it, and we're building a page.
[00:04:30.673 --> 00:04:33.595]  I mean, while he's attacking me, he's saying the Fourth Amendment's no good!
[00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:36.816]  And his callers are all disagreeing with him!
[00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:44.040]  So, it is not going to work for you, you liberal, on steroids, you bloated wolf in sheep's clothing,
[00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:51.663]  You know, your wolf hair is sticking out from underneath, you know, the sheep outfit.
[00:04:51.683 --> 00:04:52.604]  And people can see what you are.
[00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:55.505]  You got that big bushy tail sticking out the back.
[00:04:56.065 --> 00:04:58.286]  You make me want to puke, you little worm!
[00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.091]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:13.752]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.972 --> 00:05:21.014]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.394 --> 00:05:27.496]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:28.856]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:32.160]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.342]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.643 --> 00:05:41.871]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.172 --> 00:05:45.576]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:45.976 --> 00:05:49.120]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.240]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.340]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.421]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:50.641]  Call today.
[00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:04.745]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:05.085 --> 00:06:13.908]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:18.910]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:26.097]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:26.498 --> 00:06:38.270]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.212]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:06:43.392 --> 00:06:45.853]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:47.693]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:47.713 --> 00:06:48.894]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[00:06:50.455 --> 00:06:51.495]  Now get available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.555 --> 00:07:04.922]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.102 --> 00:07:09.530]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.872]  There is a chance...
[00:07:12.073 --> 00:07:14.055]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:07:14.135 --> 00:07:16.977]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:07:17.217 --> 00:07:21.441]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:28.446]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.546 --> 00:07:30.568]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.808 --> 00:07:41.372]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.552 --> 00:07:46.934]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:51.335]  Visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.355 --> 00:07:51.775]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.795 --> 00:07:53.636]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:05.970]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.691]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:12.872 --> 00:08:13.332]  Okay.
[00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:18.954]  On InfoWars.com, on PrisonPlanet.com, we have Tommy Franks.
[00:08:19.995 --> 00:08:20.896]  And I'm going to air this.
[00:08:20.916 --> 00:08:22.097]  This is in the public interest.
[00:08:22.137 --> 00:08:28.863]  This is a former head of CENTCOM talking about how he knew the towers were going to get knocked down days before.
[00:08:29.163 --> 00:08:30.344]  I thought nobody knew that.
[00:08:30.364 --> 00:08:31.946]  I thought nobody thought about that.
[00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:35.990]  And then conspiracy theories, how people think they've got Bin Laden.
[00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:45.138]  And then it goes into, it's real sad that we may have to have troops on the streets and martial law, but you know, it's what may happen.
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.821]  So this is the public interest here.
[00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:52.084]  We must analyze this enemy propaganda here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:52.524 --> 00:09:11.597]  But then I learned that Michael Medved, one of the Archdukes of neoconism, was being basically lambasted by his truly conservative listenership, going, hey man, you know, this Supreme Court ruling, we all got to show our IDs and ask questions and do all this, this is wrong.
[00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:15.240]  He's like, no, it's good, it's good.
[00:09:16.118 --> 00:09:19.240]  And so, then somebody calls in, and, well, what about this video?
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.901]  Alex Jones is 9-11 road attorney.
[00:09:20.921 --> 00:09:23.562]  People are at Michael Moore showings handing out flyers.
[00:09:23.602 --> 00:09:25.784]  And God bless you, by the way, for trying to save this country.
[00:09:26.544 --> 00:09:31.027]  Well, I think anyone handing those out should be investigated by the Secret Service.
[00:09:31.927 --> 00:09:32.248]  Oh, no.
[00:09:32.368 --> 00:09:36.070]  None of us wish any harm upon Lord Bush, the puppet.
[00:09:37.331 --> 00:09:39.572]  By the way, what was it?
[00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:40.873]  It was about two, three years ago.
[00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:43.014]  Somebody sent me a threatening email.
[00:09:43.928 --> 00:09:44.709]  About the President.
[00:09:44.729 --> 00:09:45.269]  You know what I did?
[00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:46.870]  Because I thought it was a provocateur.
[00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.051]  It turned out it was a lunatic.
[00:09:48.972 --> 00:09:50.152]  I thought, now this is a setup.
[00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:57.017]  So I called the Secret Service and oh, they thanked me so much and they went to the guy's house in Tennessee and he answered the door and said, yes, I did it!
[00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:57.938]  Take me away!
[00:09:58.018 --> 00:09:59.779]  And the guy's in prison last time I checked.
[00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:01.500]  It was in Tennessee newspapers.
[00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:06.904]  So, uh, no, don't you ever try it, Medved, and you're ill trying to imply something like that.
[00:10:07.164 --> 00:10:08.965]  The last thing we want is any violence.
[00:10:09.006 --> 00:10:12.428]  The last thing we want is for your bosses, the globalists,
[00:10:13.588 --> 00:10:19.755]  To give us the crisis they need, to give us the solution, the New World Order.
[00:10:19.775 --> 00:10:23.258]  Paul Watson, back from his sabbatical.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.981]  He is now joining us.
[00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:28.284]  We are graced by his presence.
[00:10:28.764 --> 00:10:29.805]  Hey Paul, good to have you on.
[00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:31.307]  Good to be back, Alex.
[00:10:32.742 --> 00:10:35.124]  I tell you, a lot went on the week you were gone.
[00:10:35.144 --> 00:10:37.946]  I mean, it is all in high gear.
[00:10:38.086 --> 00:10:43.389]  Fox News is Lacey Peterson, Lacey Peterson, Michael Moore is an idiot, Worship Ridge, Worship Ridge!
[00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.170]  I mean, that's all they're doing.
[00:10:45.371 --> 00:10:52.916]  And this latest salvo with the Lord Medvil, or Medvil I should say, what do you think of that?
[00:10:54.157 --> 00:10:56.838]  Well, I'm certainly interested in having just listened to the clip.
[00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:10.594]  As he mentioned, he implies directly that anyone who espouses the view that the government was behind 9-11 in any way should be looked at, in his words, by the Secret Service.
[00:11:11.174 --> 00:11:18.337]  And in fact, he doesn't just apply that to right-wingers, as was the case in the call that the caller called into the show with.
[00:11:18.817 --> 00:11:25.459]  He said Michael Moore was a threat to America, was dangerous to America, and should be watched also very carefully.
[00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:40.126]  Well, I guess he was watched when he went to the Saudi Embassy and was about a hundred yards away, and Secret Service is guarding our bosses, the Saudis, and this is incredible.
[00:11:40.526 --> 00:11:42.807]  And look, I don't even support more, folks.
[00:11:43.167 --> 00:11:45.268]  I think his film is a soft soap.
[00:11:46.028 --> 00:11:47.469]  In a way, it's a whitewash.
[00:11:48.109 --> 00:11:51.211]  I mean, I do support his First Amendment, but
[00:11:52.222 --> 00:11:55.684]  Michael Moore is a threat, and listen, the other neocons are even worse.
[00:11:56.244 --> 00:12:00.427]  They're calling for people's arrest outright, Paul, but please continue.
[00:12:01.347 --> 00:12:03.508]  Well, yeah, man, they all love the police state.
[00:12:04.048 --> 00:12:19.797]  In this clip, Medved states that if an officer asks for your ID, then you should produce it on demand, and he said that that's not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, because he said that if you're in a public place, then the Fourth Amendment doesn't exist.
[00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:27.614]  Well, also the Supreme Court just ruled that in your house or your backyard, you've got to answer questions, show IDs.
[00:12:27.694 --> 00:12:28.915]  I guess there's no 5th Amendment.
[00:12:29.155 --> 00:12:32.057]  And I've got to answer the new yearly census.
[00:12:32.097 --> 00:12:33.879]  We're going to get several hundred questions.
[00:12:34.259 --> 00:12:35.120]  Do I own guns?
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.381]  How much is in my bank account?
[00:12:36.661 --> 00:12:38.042]  I guess there's no 5th Amendment there either.
[00:12:39.143 --> 00:12:44.947]  Well, no, and it's all in the face of these, again, we find out fake teller alerts, this time four years old.
[00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:53.301]  Right at the time when the Democratic National Convention is taking place with all the police on the streets there anyway, the protest is caged.
[00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:56.402]  And so, you know, it focuses everyone's attention back onto it.
[00:12:57.042 --> 00:13:08.126]  And from my experience over the past week or so, even if you buy into the myth that, you know, airlines are vulnerable to hijackers, then the security is non-existent.
[00:13:08.146 --> 00:13:11.448]  I mean, my cousin got special screening.
[00:13:12.288 --> 00:13:14.409]  They routed through his bag because he had a pair of
[00:13:15.874 --> 00:13:18.798]  Stereo speakers, which they thought were bombs.
[00:13:19.438 --> 00:13:21.260]  I mean, that's the ridiculous level.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.204]  But then somebody had a heart attack on the plane and they wouldn't even help him.
[00:13:25.165 --> 00:13:28.248]  Well, somebody had a heart attack on the plane or something of that nature.
[00:13:28.268 --> 00:13:29.349]  And this was at the gate.
[00:13:31.184 --> 00:13:34.187]  Yeah, and the cockpit door was left wide open.
[00:13:34.627 --> 00:13:35.828]  The captain had left it.
[00:13:35.868 --> 00:13:36.869]  There was no one in there.
[00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:41.673]  All the stewards and stewardesses were running up and down the plane.
[00:13:42.053 --> 00:13:44.815]  The cockpit door was open for about 20 minutes.
[00:13:45.316 --> 00:13:50.940]  And so, you know, if you buy into this hijackers thing, then where is the security there?
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.641]  It's not there.
[00:13:51.721 --> 00:13:57.766]  It's on the streets of London, which I also saw with numerous armed police hanging around everywhere.
[00:13:58.965 --> 00:14:02.688]  Where you expect the security to be, it is not in place.
[00:14:02.748 --> 00:14:05.529]  And so that again defeats the whole myth of terrorism.
[00:14:05.549 --> 00:14:13.915]  And again, in Britain we've had another wave of these terror arrests where they make it seem like, you know, terrorists running around everyone's backyard.
[00:14:14.095 --> 00:14:19.319]  And in 98% of the cases, a month later they go, oh they were innocent, or oh they were really informants.
[00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.000]  We staged the arrest for their safety.
[00:14:21.929 --> 00:14:36.156]  Yeah, in the past they've been in contact with the British Intelligence Services weeks before their arrest and I mean BBC admitted that 90 to 95 percent in every case are always released a week after and the others, you know, months after.
[00:14:36.596 --> 00:14:38.697]  So again, it's... Okay, 95, not 98.
[00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.798]  Sorry, I forgot the actual number.
[00:14:42.379 --> 00:14:47.001]  So, Paul, this Tommy Frank situation,
[00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:51.739]  You've now watched the clips that are on Fox's website.
[00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:53.561]  We have a link to it on both the websites.
[00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.702]  You can go watch it at Fox.
[00:14:55.903 --> 00:14:56.903]  This is a nightmare.
[00:14:56.923 --> 00:14:57.904]  Describe that for people.
[00:14:59.085 --> 00:15:01.647]  Well, yeah, obviously it's an interview with Hannity.
[00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:04.129]  I believe it's August 3rd, a couple of days ago.
[00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:14.097]  And right off the bat, Hannity asks Frank about a public speech he gave on September 7th, four days before the attack.
[00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:18.034]  And Franks was asked what keeps him awake at night.
[00:15:18.294 --> 00:15:23.416]  And he said, what keeps me awake at night is one World Trade Center tower falling into another.
[00:15:23.796 --> 00:15:25.716]  An attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:15:25.756 --> 00:15:27.297]  That's what keeps me awake at night.
[00:15:27.317 --> 00:15:28.737]  And this was four days before the attack.
[00:15:28.757 --> 00:15:32.338]  And he goes on in the book to say someone ramming something into it.
[00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:35.559]  But again, the government had never heard of such a plan.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.500]  Never heard of anything.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.201]  They just, it was the first time they'd ever heard of it.
[00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:43.762]  But Franks had more to say, didn't he?
[00:15:44.801 --> 00:16:02.479]  Well yeah and he said the other thing that kept him awake is that the response to that kind of event would be military on the streets of America and he couched it and you know God forbid if that would happen language but again it's floating out there at a time when people are more tuned into it with this fake terror alert thing.
[00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:04.541]  And the troops are now on the streets it's it's
[00:16:05.347 --> 00:16:19.094]  Basically what he did in the cigar fishing auto interview was, you know, it's a terrible thing, I love the Constitution, I'm a big believer, but the people are gonna demand a military government after this happens, and it's just too bad, but, you know, that's what happens after we're attacked again.
[00:16:19.454 --> 00:16:26.778]  So he's saying, oh, it's too bad, shucks, none of us like it, but you know, that's just what's gonna happen after it happens again.
[00:16:27.738 --> 00:16:28.139]  Well, yeah.
[00:16:30.641 --> 00:16:42.752]  Also he talks about the capture of Bin Laden and you know how it's been so close here and there over the past few years and that he doesn't agree with the conspiracy theorists that Bin Laden
[00:16:43.459 --> 00:16:47.744]  Will be captured or has already been captured and will be brought out before the election.
[00:16:48.224 --> 00:16:53.650]  He says that he believes that people in the government are good like him.
[00:16:53.950 --> 00:17:00.738]  And if there were people in there like him, then they would blow the whistle if such a staged capture was being prepared.
[00:17:01.278 --> 00:17:02.920]  So again, it goes back to the argument of
[00:17:03.812 --> 00:17:24.224]  Tommy Franks himself you know maybe not not be in control of anything so then he thinks that with his level of knowledge then that applies to everybody in the government where you know obviously that's not the case but again it's interesting that that stage capture thing has been floated again in the mainstream media as it was on C-SPAN several months ago.
[00:17:24.264 --> 00:17:31.148]  By the way the Cigar Fish and Auto article that was done in November and then came out in December
[00:17:31.872 --> 00:17:35.034]  He says, oh, don't worry, we're about to get Saddam.
[00:17:35.174 --> 00:17:36.535]  I know something you don't know.
[00:17:37.076 --> 00:17:46.802]  And then we had Congressman LaHood, a week before, telling an Illinois newspaper that, oh, we've got him, but I can't tell you why or how.
[00:17:47.102 --> 00:17:56.588]  Then it turned out the Kurds did have, whoever this Saddam character is, it was even real, a month before, and they stuck him in the hole and staged the capture.
[00:17:56.829 --> 00:17:58.890]  That's, by the way, has now been admitted.
[00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.392]  But again, back of the newspaper, average American doesn't even know that was staged.
[00:18:02.512 --> 00:18:05.213]  Admittedly staged, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:07.714 --> 00:18:10.515]  So, Paul, there is just no telling what these people are going to pull.
[00:18:10.555 --> 00:18:16.258]  And remember, two and a half years ago, I was told by a high-level White House source
[00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:33.931]  Uh, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that,
[00:18:34.031 --> 00:18:46.674]  Will that stop them from rolling out their bin Laden, who died of natural causes, a great servant of the New World Order, his family well taken care of, rewarded with all the new defense contracts through Carlyle Group and new military, U.S.
[00:18:46.714 --> 00:18:50.835]  military-based instruction for the great job they have done for the globalists.
[00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:56.677]  And James Baker is also defending them now against the victim's families in a heroic al-Qaeda-ish fashion.
[00:18:57.277 --> 00:18:57.897]  Please continue.
[00:18:58.982 --> 00:19:01.767]  Well, I don't know whether we've preemptively stopped it.
[00:19:02.328 --> 00:19:12.024]  Because, as we've discussed before, there are kind of two factions within this competing for, you know, the head of the power of the same agenda.
[00:19:12.705 --> 00:19:22.831]  And so one might blow the whistle on the other by allowing this stage capture of Bin Laden thought process to be put out there in the mainstream media.
[00:19:23.331 --> 00:19:38.359]  So at that level it looks as if it might have been defeated but then the worry is that they will turn to something even more dangerous to give Bush the election if that camp wants Bush to be in the wilds for another four years.
[00:19:38.459 --> 00:19:48.265]  But things don't look good for Bush with the anointed Bilderberg group knighting Lord Edwards.
[00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:53.067]  So one more segment, Paul, and then we've got our special surprise guest coming on.
[00:19:53.928 --> 00:19:55.509]  Please stay with us.
[00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:04.549]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.792]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:08.012 --> 00:20:14.217]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:21:15.245 --> 00:21:17.686]  The Nasdaq, in that same time frame, is flat.
[00:21:18.366 --> 00:21:19.326]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:21:19.366 --> 00:21:21.667]  dollar was worth 17% more than a year old.
[00:21:22.187 --> 00:21:23.107]  Today, the U.S.
[00:21:23.127 --> 00:21:25.368]  dollar is worth 28% less than a year old.
[00:21:25.748 --> 00:21:27.289]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:29.849]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:36.051]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:21:37.051 --> 00:21:37.792]  Gold is moving.
[00:21:38.052 --> 00:21:39.212]  Equities are treading water.
[00:21:39.612 --> 00:21:42.173]  There's little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:21:42.808 --> 00:21:44.189]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:21:44.609 --> 00:21:46.330]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:48.732]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[00:21:56.316 --> 00:22:04.301]  On February 29th, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:22:12.734 --> 00:22:22.403]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:22:23.304 --> 00:22:29.891]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.

[00:23:26.086 --> 00:23:26.266]  That's 888-240-3337.
[00:23:32.312 --> 00:23:32.772]  I think so.
[00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:19.713]  All right, my friends.
[00:24:19.813 --> 00:24:22.553]  Back live.
[00:24:22.613 --> 00:24:23.774]  Talking to Paul Watson.
[00:24:24.574 --> 00:24:28.395]  Got Dr. Breeding coming up in the middle of the next hour to talk about
[00:24:29.272 --> 00:24:35.014]  The New Freedom Initiative, which is openly and publicly now going, oh, we're not just going to test all the children.
[00:24:35.254 --> 00:24:36.574]  They had said it was going to be adults, too.
[00:24:37.055 --> 00:24:38.375]  We're going to start with pregnant women.
[00:24:39.195 --> 00:24:44.157]  Any pregnant woman who goes through a hospital will have to be psychologically evaluated, and of course, the child will have to be taken a drug.
[00:24:45.001 --> 00:24:45.521]  I'm not kidding.
[00:24:45.541 --> 00:24:47.063]  This is in major Illinois newspapers.
[00:24:47.083 --> 00:24:48.163]  It's going to be all over the country.
[00:24:48.183 --> 00:24:51.906]  And then it's to have a job, you'll have to do this part of your national ID card.
[00:24:52.246 --> 00:24:58.010]  But the special surprise guest, and we hope the person joins us, we'll see if they do, will be coming on in a few minutes.
[00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.271]  But Paul Watson.
[00:25:01.953 --> 00:25:08.357]  Continuing with the ramped up terror alerts, and then the neocons say, oh no, it wasn't a four-year-old alert.
[00:25:08.457 --> 00:25:12.280]  But Ridge says, well, it is a four-year-old alert, but it's still very credible.
[00:25:12.899 --> 00:25:15.703]  So they can't even get their lies straight, Paul.
[00:25:17.185 --> 00:25:25.958]  Well, no, you have to ask the question, you know, at what point are these lies being ironed out to the effect where, you know, we're supposed to pick up on the fact that this is
[00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:43.003]  Erroneous false and you know staged information because at one level, you know, they would want us to think that and It is the cry wolf scenario where all along that they keep putting out these alerts and nothing happens but then you know, there's a big attack and and
[00:25:43.323 --> 00:25:45.865]  You know, they get to get up there and say, we told you so.
[00:25:45.946 --> 00:25:50.650]  And then in the future, exactly, and then in the future when there's an alert, we will pay attention.
[00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.111]  We will learn to lick boots.
[00:25:52.331 --> 00:26:05.143]  We will learn to grovel and beg for people to aim machine guns at us and search small children at checkpoints to get into shopping malls, as the FBI has publicly called for, and we've heard that newscast here on the broadcast.
[00:26:05.403 --> 00:26:06.985]  But Paul, you're absolutely right.
[00:26:08.064 --> 00:26:25.154]  They let us fight Patriot Act 1 and 2, they let us complain, they let us gripe, they let us call these fake alerts, and then the globalists blow the living daylights out of a city, nuke a city, dirty bomb, hijack jets again with remote control, and then they're gonna stand up there and say, see, I told you so.
[00:26:25.495 --> 00:26:25.855]  Go ahead.
[00:26:26.926 --> 00:26:37.611]  Well yeah, and at that point after the big attack, you know, one which will dwarf 9-11, then the terror alerts, when they do take place, you won't see it steps up to orange.
[00:26:37.691 --> 00:26:39.612]  Every time you'll see it steps up to red.
[00:26:39.992 --> 00:26:42.593]  And obviously, as we've covered before, at that point,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.043]  They start to introduce things like curfews where you can't leave your own home.
[00:26:47.444 --> 00:27:01.415]  So it's a level of police state above Orange, which will be justified after the big attack and will then bolster the credibility of these terror warnings, which obviously now are losing a lot of steam because, you know, nothing ever happens.
[00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:12.104]  But again, after the big attack, you know, they'll step up to Radler each time and then, you know, they'll really get to enact those police state measures which they've already set up.
[00:27:13.112 --> 00:27:21.014]  Remember about a month ago it was all over the news the FBI recommended putting metal detectors and people to search everyone going in shopping malls?
[00:27:21.794 --> 00:27:22.014]  Yeah.
[00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:23.755]  Well, guess what?
[00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:26.555]  I found out all over the country it's already started.
[00:27:27.296 --> 00:27:36.498]  They have things called state defense forces that are a subdivision of state guards but are federally funded and they literally... Have you seen these photos yet, Paul?
[00:27:37.472 --> 00:27:39.413]  I've seen some of them on Infowars, yeah.
[00:27:39.473 --> 00:27:40.833]  Okay, those are some a listener to.
[00:27:40.853 --> 00:27:44.614]  When you go to the websites of the states, it's even worse.
[00:27:45.014 --> 00:27:57.517]  I'm talking eight-year-old girls being searched on major city streets by people in these shabby uniforms with MP on their arm, with their bellies hanging out, smoking cigarettes.
[00:27:59.042 --> 00:28:03.285]  I mean, you talk about right out of Russia, folks, and this is going to be our life.
[00:28:03.465 --> 00:28:08.869]  Every control freak, every wannabe, just drooling to do this, Paul.
[00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:15.694]  Well, yeah, and you'll have a willing army of volunteers to be that brown shirt starzy.
[00:28:16.798 --> 00:28:20.539]  The human ego, you know, we know this from the people that lead our country.
[00:28:20.579 --> 00:28:28.041]  When you get a bit of power, you get on a power trip and you seek to control that power and expand it and dominate other people with it.
[00:28:28.502 --> 00:28:33.963]  So it satisfies the base instincts of the human ego to employ these people to do this kind of thing.
[00:28:34.383 --> 00:28:37.764]  And so that's why you'll find a lot of willing volunteers.
[00:28:38.165 --> 00:28:42.826]  Because they like tyranny, basically, and it feeds their egotistical human instinct.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.241]  Well, Russia did it, China, Germany, I mean, literally.
[00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:59.065]  The only stipulation is that you're, quote, not anti-government and they just give you a uniform that says MP and you march around searching people, training them how to be slaves.
[00:29:00.766 --> 00:29:04.367]  And it's not just football games, it's shopping malls, you name it.
[00:29:05.568 --> 00:29:08.509]  And that's because there are not enough sheep to police the other sheep.
[00:29:09.153 --> 00:29:09.593]  That's right, and...
[00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:38.770]  It's the classic paradigm, folks.
[00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:46.214]  They don't have the personnel now to do this, but after the new draft, when you have to serve in this, you're gonna be here domestically doing this.
[00:29:46.414 --> 00:29:47.315]  Paul, thanks for joining us.
[00:29:47.335 --> 00:29:47.795]  You take care.
[00:29:47.815 --> 00:29:48.375]  Good to have you back.
[00:29:48.596 --> 00:29:49.036]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:29:49.276 --> 00:29:49.856]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.637 --> 00:29:52.578]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.018 --> 00:29:54.679]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:58.221]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.032 --> 00:30:03.033]  It's finally here.
[00:30:03.173 --> 00:30:04.174]  Spring has arrived.
[00:30:04.334 --> 00:30:07.296]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:30:07.516 --> 00:30:10.978]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:30:11.198 --> 00:30:19.363]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:30:19.603 --> 00:30:20.384]  With Ark's heirloom

[00:31:01.644 --> 00:31:03.265]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.406 --> 00:31:07.509]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.649 --> 00:31:10.531]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.591 --> 00:31:17.337]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.497 --> 00:31:20.520]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.122]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.242 --> 00:31:27.966]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:31:28.166 --> 00:31:42.710]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:49.491]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today, and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96, or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[00:32:01.015 --> 00:32:02.536]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:32:02.696 --> 00:32:03.856]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:32:03.996 --> 00:32:07.438]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:07.538 --> 00:32:07.978]  Phenol?
[00:32:08.278 --> 00:32:15.401]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:32:15.681 --> 00:32:16.101]  EDTA?
[00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:19.785]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:32:19.905 --> 00:32:20.346]  Fragrance?
[00:32:20.726 --> 00:32:25.491]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:25.632 --> 00:32:30.297]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:32:30.537 --> 00:32:33.000]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.742]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:32:36.902 --> 00:32:40.464]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:32:40.644 --> 00:32:43.005]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:32:43.185 --> 00:32:44.046]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:33:02.409 --> 00:33:07.551]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.212 --> 00:33:10.593]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:14.435 --> 00:33:28.022]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to have Lieutenant Randall Jemoff, 3rd Brigade Aid to Camp, to General Ronald Rowland,
[00:33:29.059 --> 00:33:29.920]  And he is on with us.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:47.801]  He is from the Alabama Defense Force that was set up back in 1983 for state emergencies and to aid the state governor and the citizenry if the National Guard there from the state is federalized, in which we now see that, being sent over to Iraq.
[00:33:49.062 --> 00:33:51.625]  And other states have also set this up.
[00:33:53.267 --> 00:33:55.749]  In his day job, Lt.
[00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.612]  Randall Demoff is a retired state employee.
[00:33:58.653 --> 00:34:00.214]  He works for a security company.
[00:34:00.234 --> 00:34:02.216]  I'm talking to him during the break.
[00:34:02.236 --> 00:34:06.040]  He's now seeking a federal job with Homeland Security.
[00:34:07.049 --> 00:34:14.991]  And we've had listeners send us information about this and we wanted to really find out exactly what they're doing there in Alabama.
[00:34:16.092 --> 00:34:17.252]  Lieutenant, it's good to have you on.
[00:34:17.272 --> 00:34:18.012]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:34:18.532 --> 00:34:18.932]  Thank you.
[00:34:20.033 --> 00:34:28.975]  Just tell us about the Alabama Defense Force and how it was set up and some of the missions you carry out now in the great state of Alabama.
[00:34:29.876 --> 00:34:34.957]  Well, Alabama State Defense Force is an all-volunteer military.
[00:34:35.825 --> 00:34:55.536]  A state force that was created by state law to assume state military positions, missions, within the event held down National Guard was ordered to serve overseas like they are in Iraq and with the conflict ongoing at this present time.
[00:34:56.396 --> 00:35:03.000]  And small units are planned at each National Guard Army with membership composed of patriotic
[00:35:04.774 --> 00:35:08.756]  And we serve an 11-county area, southwest Alabama.
[00:35:10.217 --> 00:35:20.523]  And we provide a variety of services to the community during local emergencies and community events.
[00:35:21.624 --> 00:35:29.128]  We assist with traffic and crowd control, search and rescue, shelter management, and other vital duties.
[00:35:29.809 --> 00:35:33.491]  Example, when a hurricane comes up, we provide shelter for
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.804]  People who are having to move from their homes due to high waters and high tides.
[00:35:40.165 --> 00:35:49.814]  And we also assist the local emergency management agency with assignments.
[00:35:50.854 --> 00:35:58.141]  We had just recently performed a fit test where we fitted the Mobile Police Department all outlying
[00:36:10.546 --> 00:36:24.075]  Oh, I should add that on the official website you can see photos of you guys out there issuing this to the local police authorities and the website is www.alsdf.us
[00:36:27.977 --> 00:36:39.862]  And you can go and they've got a bunch of different great photo galleries and you can see all the different things that the Alabama Defense Force 3rd Brigade, we're talking to the 3rd Brigade right now, there's other brigades obviously.
[00:36:39.882 --> 00:36:41.983]  There's 4 brigades within the state.
[00:36:43.724 --> 00:36:46.905]  And that covers the whole theater then?
[00:36:47.685 --> 00:36:49.146]  Right, that covers the entire state.
[00:36:49.386 --> 00:36:56.609]  1st Brigade is North Alabama, 2nd Brigade is Central, 3rd is Southwest, and 4th is Southeast.
[00:36:57.347 --> 00:37:01.010]  I also saw photos where you've got mobile broken into sectors, too.
[00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:02.231]  Yes, we do.
[00:37:04.854 --> 00:37:07.456]  How many people do you have in your 3rd Brigade?
[00:37:08.357 --> 00:37:11.539]  Approximately 100 to 110 personnel.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:17.845]  Ranging prior military or some have no military prior experience.
[00:37:17.885 --> 00:37:24.931]  Like myself, I was unable to go into the service, but I was
[00:37:25.678 --> 00:37:29.999]  Introduced him to this organization, and it's a perfect fit.
[00:37:31.579 --> 00:37:39.280]  And let me just interject that our commander of the unit, his last name is Nolan.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.881]  N-O-L-A-N-D.
[00:37:41.061 --> 00:37:42.641]  Oh, Ronald Nolan, yes sir.
[00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:43.421]  Correct.
[00:37:43.801 --> 00:37:46.101]  Brigadier General Ronald Nolan, excuse me.
[00:37:46.942 --> 00:37:47.622]  That's alright.
[00:37:48.402 --> 00:37:54.783]  And so we help out the local EMA organization.
[00:37:55.396 --> 00:38:00.199]  With any tests they do or have made our systems.
[00:38:00.979 --> 00:38:08.903]  And I also saw some photos where you guys had Marine Corps Humvees and searchlights and stuff.
[00:38:10.184 --> 00:38:14.847]  In those photos, that was in the Bay Fest, where you guys provided security for that.
[00:38:15.947 --> 00:38:18.069]  Are those vehicles provided by the Marine Corps?
[00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:19.910]  No, they're not.
[00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:20.890]  One of our
[00:38:23.405 --> 00:38:43.093]  Members has a, oh, when I say an entourage of vehicles, he has his own little personnel carriers and Humvees with the big Bertha light and all this.
[00:38:44.733 --> 00:38:46.814]  Oh, now I understand, because I was getting confused.
[00:38:46.874 --> 00:38:49.495]  I was seeing all these military vehicles.
[00:38:50.175 --> 00:38:51.496]  At Mayfest, he brought
[00:38:52.031 --> 00:39:03.035]  He has a couple of Humvees and a big Bertha light and he brought that down and he's the captain within our organization.
[00:39:03.115 --> 00:39:07.057]  Well you guys really are volunteers all the way, even bringing your own vehicles.
[00:39:07.717 --> 00:39:09.538]  Just about.
[00:39:10.018 --> 00:39:21.703]  We also assisted with the, just recently held, it's a MVPA, which is Military Vehicle Preservation Association.
[00:39:22.628 --> 00:39:30.691]  The Dixie chapter sponsored it this year and they had all the vehicles from all over the United States down here.
[00:39:31.071 --> 00:39:32.692]  Yeah, I saw that, all those armored vehicles.
[00:39:32.732 --> 00:39:43.976]  Now, we also got some photos from an Alabama State football game back in January and you guys were, when you worked security at the gate with the police, what do you do?
[00:39:44.956 --> 00:39:50.858]  Check for unwanted items, alcohol, in this case umbrellas.
[00:39:51.721 --> 00:40:01.184]  Umbrellas are not allowed in the game, into the stadium, and we confiscate any unwanted items and leave them at the entrance.
[00:40:01.584 --> 00:40:05.726]  Now let me read from the BayFest section of your website.
[00:40:05.766 --> 00:40:13.028]  It says the weekend of October 3rd and 5th, members of the 3rd Brigade provided gate security at Mobile's BayFest, checking guests for contraband
[00:40:13.855 --> 00:40:14.715]  And taking tickets.
[00:40:15.296 --> 00:40:20.357]  Assisted in directing people to various events and ensuring a safe environment for a great family weekend.
[00:40:20.397 --> 00:40:26.619]  We worked closely with members of the Police Department to bring up manpower for them to attend to more important issues.
[00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:30.761]  This was the second year the 3rd has assisted in this event.
[00:40:31.341 --> 00:40:32.661]  And I saw the photos.
[00:40:32.841 --> 00:40:35.062]  Were you guys also searched bags and things?
[00:40:35.722 --> 00:40:36.723]  We searched bags.
[00:40:38.003 --> 00:40:38.683]  Chair bags.
[00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.850]  Backpacks, everything.
[00:40:44.671 --> 00:40:51.773]  Now this is an area in Mobile, and for folks that haven't been there, can you describe the area that's cordoned off for the Bay Fest?
[00:40:52.813 --> 00:41:04.376]  It's downtown Mobile, around Bienville Square, and it runs about maybe 2-3 miles in diameter, circumference.
[00:41:09.112 --> 00:41:13.255]  Have you liaised with other states that are setting up their own defense forces?
[00:41:14.356 --> 00:41:25.106]  Well, I've had other people contact me from other states, but they just go and check different websites.
[00:41:25.786 --> 00:41:30.090]  SASCAS, which is the State Guard Association, has a website.
[00:41:30.856 --> 00:41:36.517]  For people who want to set up, who do not have a state defense force in their state.
[00:41:36.637 --> 00:41:40.358]  Well, how many states have this, just a ballpark that you know of, Lieutenant?
[00:41:40.378 --> 00:41:42.158]  Approximately 30.
[00:41:44.199 --> 00:41:47.260]  And I guess others are also trying to set these up now?
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.420]  Correct.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.540]  Texas has their state guard.
[00:41:51.881 --> 00:41:57.982]  Alabama, Mississippi, Florida has
[00:41:58.695 --> 00:41:59.956]  It's trying to get there.
[00:42:00.016 --> 00:42:01.117]  Georgia has one.
[00:42:02.197 --> 00:42:04.559]  And so there's a handful of states that have.
[00:42:04.899 --> 00:42:06.280]  Okay, let me understand this.
[00:42:08.201 --> 00:42:09.622]  What is the parameters?
[00:42:09.762 --> 00:42:17.648]  I mean, if I wanted to go join this to defend the homeland, how would I, what are the, what are, what are the rules?
[00:42:18.949 --> 00:42:19.369]  Okay.
[00:42:24.997 --> 00:42:26.977]  Well, I'm just going by my notes.
[00:42:27.157 --> 00:42:30.298]  Membership in the Alabama State Defense Force is open to any U.S.
[00:42:30.338 --> 00:42:37.620]  citizen, male, female, who, at time of the lesson, is not a member of any active or reserved component of the U.S.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.280]  Armed Forces, which includes Army, Air, National Guard.
[00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:53.523]  They must be of good moral character and should be in good health, but physical disabilities are not necessarily a barrier to serve in some capacity.
[00:42:54.185 --> 00:42:55.866]  Age ranges from 18 to 70.
[00:42:55.946 --> 00:43:04.853]  Prime military experience is not a requirement, though former servicemen and women, including military retirees, are actively sought.
[00:43:07.958 --> 00:43:24.967]  We talked to the gentleman, he lives in Pensacola, but he was at the Alabama Senior Bowl in January and he said that he was taking photos and asking about this and saying, well, doesn't this violate posse comitatus to have a quasi-military group out searching bags?
[00:43:25.027 --> 00:43:26.368]  And he said, can I join?
[00:43:26.388 --> 00:43:29.390]  And they said, well, no, because you're obviously anti-government.
[00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:32.972]  What does anti-government mean or is that an unwritten stipulation?
[00:43:34.313 --> 00:43:35.793]  Oh, I can't comment on that.
[00:43:37.268 --> 00:43:38.990]  Well versed with that.
[00:43:40.192 --> 00:43:40.693]  Yes, it was.
[00:43:40.713 --> 00:43:41.013]  Oh, man.
[00:43:41.033 --> 00:43:42.075]  It's been... Yeah.
[00:43:55.437 --> 00:43:57.899]  It's hard to recall anything like that.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.102]  Well, let me just be upfront and honest with you.
[00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:03.304]  I've been in the Civil Air Patrol.
[00:44:04.104 --> 00:44:07.787]  My dad's a pilot and he got me into the Civil Air Patrol when I was in high school.
[00:44:07.807 --> 00:44:09.328]  I learned a lot and I enjoyed it.
[00:44:09.389 --> 00:44:13.071]  It was rewarding, you know, out looking for submarines and stuff.
[00:44:13.532 --> 00:44:15.453]  So that's been my only little military experience.
[00:44:15.493 --> 00:44:16.134]  I thought it was good.
[00:44:16.154 --> 00:44:19.597]  I think getting citizens involved in
[00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:23.972]  Oh, you know, back during World War II, they called it civil defense.
[00:44:25.053 --> 00:44:26.334]  And I think that that is good.
[00:44:27.634 --> 00:44:33.517]  And, you know, I think it's good to have people, if there's a hurricane or a big fire, I think it's wonderful.
[00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:37.874]  But I have to tell you that, number one, there's something called the Fourth Amendment.
[00:44:38.235 --> 00:44:41.017]  Number two, there's the 1878 Posse Comitatus Law.
[00:44:41.738 --> 00:45:00.934]  And to look at the photos on your Bay Fest section alone, with eight-year-old children being searched, looking scared to death, and people walking around with MP on their arm, and then now the FBI saying, we may want to put police and have a new draft for domestic forces at the mall, searching all the bags.
[00:45:01.814 --> 00:45:06.056]  I think that's a dangerous trend and it doesn't do anything to protect us from terrorists.
[00:45:07.477 --> 00:45:08.157]  What do you say to that?
[00:45:08.177 --> 00:45:10.058]  No comment.
[00:45:11.459 --> 00:45:29.967]  Our basic foundation is that we assist with whenever there's a ship coming in we provide security for that Navy ship and security for
[00:45:35.444 --> 00:45:45.349]  Well, in these photos, there's cops standing right behind you guys, and they're doing nothing, and you guys are searching bags, training people to accept military on the street.
[00:45:45.389 --> 00:45:53.954]  And we all grew up knowing that in Russia, and in Mexico, and in Germany, that they had troops out searching people's bags, checking their papers.
[00:45:54.234 --> 00:45:59.797]  I mean, can't you, somewhere in your mind, realize that this is not how America's supposed to be?
[00:46:01.079 --> 00:46:19.945]  Well, we've tried to instill that anybody, let's see how I can phrase this, that your average Joe, anybody is capable of doing anything at any time.
[00:46:20.966 --> 00:46:22.966]  Oh, so we're all, oh I understand, yes.
[00:46:25.854 --> 00:46:26.614]  Well, I noticed that.
[00:46:26.654 --> 00:46:29.496]  This is a key point, Lieutenant, and please continue.
[00:46:29.596 --> 00:46:31.117]  Look, I'm talking to you.
[00:46:31.137 --> 00:46:31.877]  I don't think you're bad.
[00:46:32.298 --> 00:46:34.018]  I'm getting an idea of what you're doing.
[00:46:34.999 --> 00:46:37.540]  We've had listeners who were concerned about this and we just want to know.
[00:46:37.941 --> 00:46:40.962]  But I appreciate you coming on and being honest with us and talking to us.
[00:46:43.775 --> 00:46:58.975]  Sitting here looking at this, dealing with this, we have the federal government pushing and promoting all of this, and I know the state is getting Homeland Security funds, you say you want this federal Homeland Security job, it just
[00:47:00.018 --> 00:47:03.800]  A lot of people are concerned about this, and this is the key question.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:14.644]  You know, we're hearing all this is for terrorism, but at the checkpoints all over the country, at the military checkpoints, at all this stuff popping up, they're looking for guns, they're looking for drugs, they're looking for driver's licenses.
[00:47:14.704 --> 00:47:16.165]  Oh, is your insurance in place?
[00:47:16.445 --> 00:47:17.946]  You know, guilty until proven innocent.
[00:47:18.126 --> 00:47:24.149]  So you guys say this is all being done now because of terrorism, but you're looking for beer being snuck into football games.
[00:47:24.169 --> 00:47:24.849]  What do you say to that?
[00:47:26.067 --> 00:47:32.098]  Well, they're not supposed to carry contraband alcohol to football games.
[00:47:32.478 --> 00:47:35.584]  But we're told this is because of terrorism, but now it's this wide net.
[00:47:38.228 --> 00:47:38.389]  So...
[00:47:39.591 --> 00:47:40.611]  Yeah, but do you see how they go?
[00:47:40.711 --> 00:47:48.733]  Homeland Security's putting up cameras to fight terrorism, and then, oh, and crime, and we're going to watch you, and you just said that everybody's capable of something.
[00:47:48.753 --> 00:47:50.794]  You know, everybody's a suspect, basically.
[00:47:51.114 --> 00:47:52.674]  In America, that's not how it works.
[00:47:52.974 --> 00:47:56.875]  Plus, Lieutenant Dimoff, our borders are wide open, my friend.
[00:47:58.816 --> 00:48:00.596]  Shouldn't we send you guys down to the border?
[00:48:01.497 --> 00:48:03.037]  Well, we're only...
[00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:05.791]  Operational within the state.
[00:48:06.191 --> 00:48:09.253]  No, I understand, but I'm saying the other states that are doing this that are on the border.
[00:48:09.273 --> 00:48:20.298]  I mean, I think your mission of guarding ships, that's admirable, but going downtown and searching 8-year-olds is nothing but a conditioning mechanism for this.
[00:48:20.779 --> 00:48:22.980]  Well, we don't search 8-year-olds.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.861]  We have a photograph of it off your website.
[00:48:25.921 --> 00:48:26.542]  I mean, maybe she's 10.
[00:48:27.893 --> 00:48:29.795]  Well, I'll have to check the website.
[00:48:30.055 --> 00:48:38.743]  And I mean, the image of people with military police armbands on, with smoking cigarettes, you know, with Humvees that say U.S.
[00:48:38.783 --> 00:48:41.545]  Marine Corps on it, I mean, it's a scary image.
[00:48:41.565 --> 00:48:47.290]  Well, I think this is about the end of our conversation, sir.
[00:48:48.411 --> 00:48:49.893]  Okay, this is the end of our conversation?
[00:48:50.974 --> 00:48:51.274]  Correct.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:49:00.402]  Alright, well, I don't think you're bad, but I know you want that federal job, and I think you need to defend America and the Bill of Rights, okay, Lieutenant?
[00:49:01.022 --> 00:49:01.342]  Correct.
[00:49:02.022 --> 00:49:02.962]  What was your name again?
[00:49:03.262 --> 00:49:10.604]  It is Alex Jones, and the website is InfoWars.com, and prison... Oh, is somebody talking in your ear right now?
[00:49:12.504 --> 00:49:18.026]  No, I'm at a... doing some personal business.
[00:49:18.166 --> 00:49:19.706]  Why do you say it's the end of our conversation?
[00:49:21.408 --> 00:49:23.409]  Because it's getting loud in here.
[00:49:23.469 --> 00:49:25.510]  What was your name again?
[00:49:26.051 --> 00:49:27.651]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:49:27.672 --> 00:49:29.032]  Uh-huh.
[00:49:29.573 --> 00:49:31.113]  From Central Texas.
[00:49:32.034 --> 00:49:50.144]  And I've read the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and I know that this stuff is something that we've seen in other countries, and it's a very dangerous trend, and a lot of well-meaning people are getting involved in this, and I don't think you're a bad person, sir,
[00:49:51.016 --> 00:49:58.341]  But I think that overall, searching people in downtown cities... Well, here's my last question.
[00:49:58.381 --> 00:49:59.141]  Please answer it.
[00:49:59.802 --> 00:50:03.784]  How are you wearing military police armbands if it's a volunteer organization?
[00:50:04.745 --> 00:50:06.946]  We have our own military.
[00:50:07.287 --> 00:50:15.452]  We have a cast slate group within our unit.
[00:50:17.273 --> 00:50:18.514]  So they're police officers?
[00:50:19.514 --> 00:50:20.435]  Former police officers.
[00:50:21.195 --> 00:50:21.976]  Some are correct.
[00:50:21.996 --> 00:50:24.898]  We have a few that are former police officers.
[00:50:45.899 --> 00:50:47.242]  And you got your own armored vehicles?
[00:50:47.602 --> 00:50:47.983]  Come on!
[00:50:48.103 --> 00:50:48.364]  Come on!
[00:50:48.384 --> 00:50:49.085]  This isn't America!
[00:50:49.386 --> 00:50:50.608]  You need to wake up, Lieutenant!
[00:50:50.888 --> 00:50:56.859]  I appreciate you coming on the show, but I want you to defend the Republic, and I want you to stand up against the New World Order!
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:57.581]  Take care!
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.881]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.041 --> 00:51:06.103]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.243 --> 00:51:10.145]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.205 --> 00:51:14.427]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.768 --> 00:51:18.550]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:20.471]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.751 --> 00:51:23.954]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:28.739]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.899 --> 00:51:31.942]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:34.985]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.466 --> 00:51:41.592]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.112 --> 00:51:45.915]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:46.315 --> 00:51:47.676]  Order your video today.
[00:51:48.016 --> 00:51:49.077]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.097 --> 00:51:51.378]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.438 --> 00:51:52.679]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:52:00.709 --> 00:52:05.935]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:06.075 --> 00:52:14.185]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:14.445 --> 00:52:21.493]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:21.653 --> 00:52:22.934]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:52:23.014 --> 00:52:28.919]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.099 --> 00:52:34.203]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.303 --> 00:52:43.191]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:43.451 --> 00:52:46.753]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:52:48.835 --> 00:52:49.696]  We're good to go!
[00:53:16.878 --> 00:53:17.538]  We're good to go.

[00:54:08.849 --> 00:54:13.993]  We're on a fine radio station in Pensacola, Florida that broadcasts in Alabama.
[00:54:14.013 --> 00:54:18.297]  We're also on another station in Alabama owned by the same folks.
[00:54:19.418 --> 00:54:21.119]  I don't think we're on in Mobile though.
[00:54:21.139 --> 00:54:24.242]  We were on for about a year until a big, big station sold.
[00:54:24.742 --> 00:54:25.322]  I remember that.
[00:54:25.583 --> 00:54:27.404]  It was great being able to warn the people there.
[00:54:27.965 --> 00:54:31.968]  And you look at the photographs of the people being searched, and I mean little children.
[00:54:33.209 --> 00:54:34.729]  And the people are scared.
[00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.870]  And a picture tells a thousand words.
[00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:41.031]  You have got to go look at these goons that are out doing this.
[00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:46.872]  I mean, people with their bellies hanging out, smoking cigarettes, searching women's purses.
[00:54:48.352 --> 00:54:49.193]  It's nauseating.
[00:54:49.213 --> 00:54:50.193]  And I'm not saying they're bad.
[00:54:50.233 --> 00:54:55.834]  I mean, talking to Lieutenant Randall Demoff, who wants his Homeland Security job.
[00:54:55.854 --> 00:54:59.075]  He admitted that during a break with me, and you heard me talk about it.
[00:54:59.095 --> 00:55:00.375]  He didn't deny it.
[00:55:02.092 --> 00:55:03.573]  Uh, just talking to Demoff.
[00:55:04.574 --> 00:55:05.535]  Uh, I don't think he's evil.
[00:55:05.635 --> 00:55:13.082]  You know, he wants, he thinks we've been attacked by terrorists and he wants to do this and so they told him, we'll go down to the, go down to the city streets and just search everybody and this is the freedom.
[00:55:13.682 --> 00:55:15.724]  Training our children that searching them is good.
[00:55:15.764 --> 00:55:18.666]  That's all this is, is a process of warping our minds.
[00:55:20.308 --> 00:55:23.971]  And they bring their own armored vehicles, they bring their own trucks down there.
[00:55:23.991 --> 00:55:27.394]  Uh, they're running around with military police armbands.
[00:55:28.238 --> 00:55:29.940]  And you hurting folks.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.822]  Some of these people are not former police or whatever.
[00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:47.093]  I mean, folks, it's hard for tyranny to get enough professional men and women that are really trained, who know how to rappel out of helicopters, that know how to fight and know how to run the equipment, and are real soldiers.
[00:55:47.434 --> 00:55:53.799]  Most of the real soldiers I talk to are disgusted by the plans to take this country over that are publicly being given to them.
[00:55:54.443 --> 00:56:07.621]  But they can find a lot of little neighborhood wannabes who want to put on a uniform and strut around, you know, with their uniforms looking like, uh, I mean, just the most shoddy.
[00:56:07.681 --> 00:56:09.404]  It's like they're wearing green bags.
[00:56:10.956 --> 00:56:13.557]  Just walking around with a hamburger in one hand, a cigarette in another.
[00:56:13.577 --> 00:56:15.697]  I mean, it is really a joke, people.
[00:56:16.017 --> 00:56:18.198]  Driving their own armored vehicles around.
[00:56:18.438 --> 00:56:20.418]  Y'all see these photos of them with machine guns.
[00:56:21.458 --> 00:56:22.299]  It's a joke!
[00:56:22.439 --> 00:56:25.899]  And I'm telling you folks, you're going to have it in every single town.
[00:56:26.079 --> 00:56:27.780]  But it's going to be a gray uniform.
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:29.920]  I learned of this with Bill Clinton back in 98.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:31.000]  He had the plan.
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:32.221]  And that's the same plan.
[00:56:32.721 --> 00:56:35.921]  The toll roads they're building, all of this, are going to be checkpoints.
[00:56:35.961 --> 00:56:38.142]  And you're going to have to serve 10, 20, in some cases 30 hours
[00:56:39.592 --> 00:56:45.779]  A week, and you're not going to be paid, or you'll be paid a small stipend that's on a little security card you're going to get.
[00:56:46.219 --> 00:56:47.941]  And you're going to have to sit there and dig through cars.
[00:56:47.981 --> 00:56:49.042]  And listen, I'll go to prison.
[00:56:49.423 --> 00:56:52.546]  I am not going to be drafted and sit there at a checkpoint and search your car.
[00:56:52.606 --> 00:56:54.308]  It's just not going to happen, folks.
[00:56:54.928 --> 00:56:57.191]  Now, they want to draft me to send me down to the border.
[00:56:57.791 --> 00:57:02.776]  When these Mexican troops are killing federal officers and shooting people, absolutely, you don't have to draft me.
[00:57:03.337 --> 00:57:10.043]  You want me to go spend, you know, two weekends a month doing it, or if the country really needs it, I'll quit the radio show and go down to the border.
[00:57:10.824 --> 00:57:19.032]  But I will not, I will not ever, ever go breathe a pleat of uranium in Iraq or wherever they're going to invade next.
[00:57:19.312 --> 00:57:22.095]  I will not sit around at checkpoints with my belly hanging out.
[00:57:24.108 --> 00:57:24.649]  Oh, please.
[00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.390]  Help us.
[00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:26.071]  Help us.
[00:57:26.331 --> 00:57:26.751]  Help us.
[00:57:26.771 --> 00:57:27.993]  You've got to look at these photos.
[00:57:28.013 --> 00:57:28.814]  It's disgusting.
[00:57:28.874 --> 00:57:29.875]  God, please help us.
[00:57:30.516 --> 00:57:37.704]  Before I end this hour, and I'll go right back to your calls, we'll go to Frank and Marion and Bob and Moe and others right when we get back in the second hour.
[00:57:38.484 --> 00:57:40.384]  Don't have a guest for 30 minutes, so we've got time.
[00:57:40.404 --> 00:57:42.585]  1-800-259-9231 is the number.
[00:57:42.605 --> 00:57:45.125]  Of course, the phones are loaded.
[00:57:45.145 --> 00:57:45.886]  Why should I give numbers out?
[00:57:46.486 --> 00:57:48.706]  If you want to get my videos, I've made 10 films.
[00:57:48.806 --> 00:57:50.707]  Folks, do not procrastinate.
[00:57:51.147 --> 00:57:54.608]  I don't spend a lot of time belaboring this, because I'm so focused on the information.
[00:57:54.868 --> 00:57:57.568]  But the films are the most powerful information we've got.
[00:57:57.648 --> 00:57:58.588]  The most informative.
[00:57:59.089 --> 00:58:00.969]  The best tool we've got to wake people up.
[00:58:01.369 --> 00:58:02.789]  Get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:58:02.849 --> 00:58:03.830]  Get Masters of Terror.
[00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:05.830]  Get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:58:06.485 --> 00:58:07.806]  They're scared of these things.
[00:58:07.886 --> 00:58:08.867]  Get them out to people.
[00:58:08.927 --> 00:58:09.948]  Wake everybody up.
[00:58:10.349 --> 00:58:12.010]  Toll free number to order the films.
[00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:12.731]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:12.751 --> 00:58:13.312]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:13.332 --> 00:58:18.677]  Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order via the safe secure shopping cart.
[00:58:28.627 --> 00:58:30.208]  Or PrisonPlanet.TV for that matter.
[00:58:30.569 --> 00:58:33.151]  Please get three or more and save $18.
[00:58:34.151 --> 00:58:35.613]  I got a bunch of other specials going.
[00:58:35.633 --> 00:58:39.115]  Just call and ask about them.
[00:58:39.135 --> 00:58:43.819]  1-888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:44.059 --> 00:58:46.181]  And we need your support as well.
[00:58:46.601 --> 00:58:48.123]  Second Hour, your calls, ton of news.
[00:58:48.143 --> 00:58:48.503]  Stay with us.
[00:58:57.862 --> 00:58:58.502]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.162 --> 00:59:00.223]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.943 --> 00:59:02.043]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.704 --> 00:59:03.524]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.264 --> 00:59:05.185]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.845 --> 00:59:09.506]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.026 --> 00:59:14.148]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.968 --> 00:59:20.470]  Well, I sure hope your station carried the last hour, because you missed it.
[00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:24.191]  It'll be re-aired tonight at the first hour, 9 to 10 o'clock, Central.
[00:59:25.328 --> 00:59:42.340]  We had the Lieutenant Randall Demoff aid the camp to General Ronald Noland from the 3rd Brigade Alabama Defense Force admitting they're out searching people's bags on the city streets at football games.
[00:59:43.641 --> 00:59:45.442]  They have their own armored vehicles.
[00:59:45.942 --> 00:59:50.966]  They were military police armbands and 30 states are now implementing this, he said.
[00:59:52.449 --> 00:59:55.030]  And I found a bunch of states that are doing it.
[00:59:56.291 --> 01:00:02.254]  Again, it's one thing to have a volunteer force to aid the state guard for hurricanes, fires, whatever.
[01:00:02.294 --> 01:00:06.437]  But just to have them out searching people's bags, doing this with their bellies hanging out, smoking cigarettes.
[01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:08.638]  I mean, it's really sick, folks.
[01:00:08.658 --> 01:00:14.241]  You've got to go look at the photos our listener got of them at the Senior Bowl in Alabama a few months ago.
[01:00:14.341 --> 01:00:21.405]  But more importantly, link through to AOSDF.US and go look at the other defense forces in other states.
[01:00:22.637 --> 01:00:27.200]  I didn't have any time yesterday, but I spent like an hour and a half and got way behind just looking at hundreds of photos.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.621]  It is nightmarish.
[01:00:28.681 --> 01:00:32.463]  And now the FBI says, we want to have these groups at all the shopping malls searching you.
[01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:40.348]  And there's photos of little girls, no more than, you know, ten years old, probably eight, having their bags searched in total fear on their own website!
[01:00:41.409 --> 01:00:47.592]  People with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths and hamburgers in their hands, standing there while another goon searches families.
[01:00:47.673 --> 01:00:49.614]  I mean, it is just... it is so...
[01:00:50.899 --> 01:00:53.721]  I'm not saying they're the brown shirts, but that's how the brown shirts operated.
[01:00:53.941 --> 01:00:58.865]  You should go get a bunch of goons and wannabes and give them a uniform and they're... It's sick!
[01:00:59.505 --> 01:01:02.547]  It's hard to get highly trained, smart people to join this evil.
[01:01:02.707 --> 01:01:03.868]  They're smart enough to know what's going on.
[01:01:04.008 --> 01:01:06.630]  But you find some useful idiot, they'll do whatever's needed.
[01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:10.893]  Let us go ahead and take some calls.
[01:01:12.114 --> 01:01:12.815]  Oh my goodness.
[01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:14.476]  Frank in West Virginia.
[01:01:14.516 --> 01:01:15.336]  Frank, you're on the air.
[01:01:15.376 --> 01:01:15.797]  Go ahead.
[01:01:16.117 --> 01:01:18.799]  Hey Alex, just want to give you a little update of what's going on in the state.
[01:01:19.458 --> 01:01:23.340]  And also follow up with a question for you about an unrelated issue.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:31.884]  First of all, I wanted to mention Tom Ridge was in West Virginia here yesterday and there was an interview on a local talk show or statewide talk show.
[01:01:32.672 --> 01:01:37.375]  Well, you've had three or four Marine Corps takeover drills in your major cities in the last three months.
[01:01:52.611 --> 01:01:58.060]  Keeping it a secret until after it was over so it was difficult to track it.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.286]  And they practiced taking over buildings, taking over City Hall, all part of the freedom.
[01:02:02.867 --> 01:02:03.909]  Oh it is, it is.
[01:02:03.969 --> 01:02:05.992]  There were all types of military
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:11.424]  Uh, transports and helicopters going over the cities, uh, for quite a long time.
[01:02:11.724 --> 01:02:13.786]  And some people are quite, uh, upset about that.
[01:02:13.866 --> 01:02:15.147]  Yeah, I've read your newspapers.
[01:02:15.167 --> 01:02:16.309]  It's the same drill they always do.
[01:02:16.329 --> 01:02:17.850]  I've got it on video in three of my films.
[01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:18.931]  Been there, done that.
[01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:20.032]  Oh, they search.
[01:02:20.072 --> 01:02:21.493]  They're in your backyard at night.
[01:02:21.854 --> 01:02:23.115]  Some of the houses volunteer.
[01:02:23.135 --> 01:02:24.476]  They do gun confiscations.
[01:02:24.516 --> 01:02:25.237]  It's all part of freedom.
[01:02:25.577 --> 01:02:26.318]  Oh, it sure is.
[01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:27.278]  And people love it.
[01:02:27.419 --> 01:02:28.720]  It's really sad.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.603]  But, uh, today they have their unit.
[01:02:32.643 --> 01:02:33.244]  They have a new
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.461]  Type of what they call it, it's a shower.
[01:02:37.081 --> 01:02:40.063]  A decontamination shower for casualties.
[01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:42.524]  And again, that's about 5% of the funding.
[01:02:42.564 --> 01:02:43.544]  That's just the window dressing.
[01:02:43.604 --> 01:02:44.504]  Oh, it's to protect you.
[01:02:45.285 --> 01:02:48.926]  90 plus percent is troops, machine guns, bunkers, takeover drills.
[01:02:49.587 --> 01:02:53.748]  Yes, the state was allocated millions and millions more for the same thing.
[01:02:53.768 --> 01:02:56.730]  And it seems like it's becoming a hub for the country for several different
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.802]  For several different agencies.
[01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.863]  In fact, a whole slew of agencies.
[01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:04.085]  I think they mentioned 17 a while back.
[01:03:05.106 --> 01:03:10.411]  And they're going to have it here at the north-central part of the state.
[01:03:11.312 --> 01:03:14.815]  Camp Dawson is going to be the central location for that.
[01:03:14.835 --> 01:03:16.777]  It's the only one in the state of its kind right now.
[01:03:19.756 --> 01:03:22.517]  They were talking about some of these volunteers that you had mentioned.
[01:03:22.537 --> 01:03:28.120]  You know, these asking for people to watch their neighborhoods for any signs of terrorism and so forth?
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:32.361]  Well, there's actually going to be some type of training manual that will be given out in the future.
[01:03:32.502 --> 01:03:35.163]  Yeah, the same thing in Texas and Florida has been given out in it.
[01:03:35.563 --> 01:03:36.363]  Watch your neighbor.
[01:03:36.483 --> 01:03:37.304]  Fight crime.
[01:03:37.404 --> 01:03:38.504]  Crime, AIDS, terror.
[01:03:38.984 --> 01:03:41.305]  I want to ask you about Oshkosh, if you happen to know.
[01:03:41.405 --> 01:03:43.086]  Oh, the huge gun confiscation?
[01:03:43.466 --> 01:03:43.766]  Yes.
[01:03:43.906 --> 01:03:45.127]  Yeah, we interviewed the folks from there.
[01:03:45.667 --> 01:03:49.509]  I heard the interview and I was wondering if you know how many homes were actually raided.
[01:03:49.569 --> 01:03:50.230]  Stay there!
[01:03:55.833 --> 01:04:01.316]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.736 --> 01:04:05.978]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:04:06.198 --> 01:04:13.202]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.602 --> 01:04:19.706]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.726 --> 01:04:21.107]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.427 --> 01:04:24.369]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:04:24.529 --> 01:04:26.551]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:34.095]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:04:34.396 --> 01:04:37.778]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:04:38.198 --> 01:04:41.341]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:04:41.361 --> 01:04:41.461]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.481 --> 01:04:41.581]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.701 --> 01:04:42.602]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:04:42.622 --> 01:04:42.862]  Call today.
[01:04:53.419 --> 01:04:55.020]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:59.244]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:59.424 --> 01:05:02.306]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:02.386 --> 01:05:09.092]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:12.294]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:12.494 --> 01:05:14.896]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:14.996 --> 01:05:22.903]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:05:23.203 --> 01:05:34.472]  Mercosine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[01:05:34.632 --> 01:05:41.898]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Murky Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:42.338]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:42.358 --> 01:05:43.759]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:52.777 --> 01:05:57.120]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:01.702]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.862 --> 01:06:06.225]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:06.265 --> 01:06:07.646]  The New World Order.
[01:06:08.406 --> 01:06:09.367]  Pan America.
[01:06:09.427 --> 01:06:10.207]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:38.066 --> 01:06:38.886]  Big Brother.
[01:06:38.926 --> 01:06:40.187]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:40.227 --> 01:06:41.167]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:41.187 --> 01:06:41.688]  You want answers?
[01:06:41.868 --> 01:06:42.408]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.919 --> 01:07:09.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.241]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.902 --> 01:07:21.143]  Boy, if you just joined us, you have collided with the truth.
[01:07:22.364 --> 01:07:24.044]  And a lot of people hide from the truth.
[01:07:24.064 --> 01:07:25.185]  They try to cower from it.
[01:07:25.205 --> 01:07:29.906]  They think it will make it go away, but that's what a child does when they play peek-a-boo.
[01:07:29.946 --> 01:07:33.047]  They think if they cover their eyes, the world around them changes.
[01:07:34.798 --> 01:07:37.560]  That's not the case, my friends, so stop being childlike.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.441]  It's the end of innocence here.
[01:07:39.741 --> 01:07:40.541]  It's the reality.
[01:07:40.882 --> 01:07:41.682]  It's what we face.
[01:07:42.182 --> 01:07:47.005]  We've got to have our chin up, my friends, and stand against this.
[01:07:47.025 --> 01:07:48.446]  That's how we have a chance.
[01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:51.708]  Not to cower like a bunch of spineless jellyfish.
[01:07:52.933 --> 01:08:04.858]  And yes, all over the country, again we got the evidence as a federal plan, the TIPS program locally, exterminators, the cable guy, everybody to be spies, looking for all crimes, or suspicion of crime.
[01:08:05.338 --> 01:08:12.561]  Again, the police have to have a warrant to get in your house, but when you pay the carpet cleaner, or pay the cable man to come, they're going to be spying on you, looking for something.
[01:08:12.601 --> 01:08:17.683]  And they see the billboard that says report illegal guns, they see a revolver on a case on the wall,
[01:08:18.323 --> 01:08:24.486]  You get a SWAT team rate even though you can buy the revolver at any store or buy it mail order, you know, from the NRA.
[01:08:24.506 --> 01:08:27.707]  I mean, this is the freedom.
[01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:29.688]  This is the torture of liberty, folks.
[01:08:29.708 --> 01:08:30.508]  This is the new freedom.
[01:08:30.989 --> 01:08:34.550]  Real quick, Frank, finish up because I've got to go to Mary and Bob, Moe, Robert and others.
[01:08:35.251 --> 01:08:36.211]  Yeah, the old action.
[01:08:36.961 --> 01:08:48.295]  Uh, you'll have my guns when you can pry them from my cold, dead fingers, uh, comes to mind when I'm wondering if this Oshkosh, uh, case might be, uh, something that was sponsored by the federal government.
[01:08:48.336 --> 01:08:54.123]  It's speculation, but it seems awful fishy when there's, uh, no
[01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:58.779]  And yet they're confiscating weapons to do ballistics tests.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.742]  I saw later articles over a hundred homes were searched.
[01:09:02.842 --> 01:09:06.585]  Again, a cop got shot by a teen.
[01:09:07.306 --> 01:09:08.867]  It was just grazed him.
[01:09:09.388 --> 01:09:15.492]  And then they evacuated a neighborhood and searched, made everybody go to a sports facility, into a gymnasium.
[01:09:15.853 --> 01:09:17.254]  They confiscated all guns.
[01:09:17.314 --> 01:09:18.615]  Folks still haven't gotten them back.
[01:09:19.435 --> 01:09:20.796]  And one guy threatened to sue.
[01:09:20.816 --> 01:09:23.859]  They gave them back to him right away and said, this is the new way we do it.
[01:09:24.668 --> 01:09:28.493]  And, uh, but they have other cases where they evacuate neighborhoods and do stuff like this.
[01:09:28.513 --> 01:09:29.114]  Thanks for the call.
[01:09:29.274 --> 01:09:29.755]  Thank you.
[01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:30.455]  I appreciate it.
[01:09:30.596 --> 01:09:31.817]  Marion in Idaho.
[01:09:31.837 --> 01:09:32.538]  Marion, go ahead.
[01:09:33.679 --> 01:09:35.342]  Her phone just dropped right when I went to her.
[01:09:36.223 --> 01:09:37.744]  Uh, Bob in Florida.
[01:09:37.764 --> 01:09:38.505]  Bob, go ahead.
[01:09:38.846 --> 01:09:39.507]  Okay, Alex.
[01:09:40.747 --> 01:09:41.067]  Yes, sir.
[01:09:41.187 --> 01:09:47.828]  Glad I was able to hang on here, because the local AM affiliate doesn't carry your, you know, ten minutes or so.
[01:09:48.369 --> 01:09:51.889]  I missed, you know, a lot, but I'm not... I don't understand that.
[01:09:51.929 --> 01:09:52.429]  What are you saying?
[01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:53.550]  Oh, okay.
[01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:55.210]  I'll get to the... The local affiliate, what?
[01:09:55.470 --> 01:10:05.152]  Doesn't carry your show, because they have the local news, and then Reverend Chuck Baldwin gives some sort of like, you know, daily, you know, sort of like... So you're saying you missed the first eight minutes?
[01:10:05.877 --> 01:10:07.579]  Uh, yeah, and I'm glad I was on hold here.
[01:10:07.819 --> 01:10:09.040]  I can hear it, okay?
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.104]  But what I'm calling is two, you know, points, okay?
[01:10:13.544 --> 01:10:23.413]  I want to say that the interview with Lieutenant Randall Demmock was really the, you know, main purpose of my call, but I also want to say you probably didn't hear coast-to-coast last night with George Neary.
[01:10:23.793 --> 01:10:29.779]  He had on Gina Davis, a investigative reporter, who has out a book now called The Third Terrorist.
[01:10:29.999 --> 01:10:31.000]  I believe that's the title of it.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:39.004]  All about the Oklahoma City bombing and Al-Qaeda and our government and I think you ought to try and get this lady on for an interview.
[01:10:44.664 --> 01:11:03.559]  One of the alleged, and the police say it's him, John Doe's with McVeigh, she won the lawsuit, and all the information that she covers and more, and the police surveillance tapes surveilling these Iraqis, that's all in the video Road to Tyranny.
[01:11:03.579 --> 01:11:06.601]  42 minutes of that two and a half hour film is about Oklahoma.
[01:11:07.562 --> 01:11:08.383]  And I did hear
[01:11:09.145 --> 01:11:16.629]  Mrs. Davis ended up staying up quite late listening to it last night, and now she's going out and doing interviews, and I do plan to have her on.
[01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:25.834]  She was the local News 4 reporter that broke so much of this, but again, she doesn't go to the next level, and Colonel Craig Roberts and others do.
[01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:33.018]  George Bush Sr., and this is public, we have the Washington Post, the Washington Times admitting this from 1992-93.
[01:11:33.819 --> 01:11:35.940]  Bill Clinton and George Bush brought in
[01:11:37.072 --> 01:11:38.915]  Over 5,000 Iraqis.
[01:11:38.975 --> 01:11:40.737]  Now it looks like even more, but we can confirm 5,000.
[01:11:41.899 --> 01:11:45.664]  These were the guys trained in the 1980s by the U.S.
[01:11:45.704 --> 01:11:47.085]  government for the Iran-Iraq War.
[01:11:47.546 --> 01:11:51.872]  Then they were brought in after the Gulf War, settled, given homes, paid.
[01:11:52.252 --> 01:11:55.036]  Then they pop up with McVeigh, known CIA officers.
[01:11:56.201 --> 01:12:03.045]  Pop up with McVeigh all over the country, then they show up, the surveillance cameras pick them up, bombing the building.
[01:12:03.626 --> 01:12:06.748]  I've talked to police, firefighters, the witnesses, it's all in the film!
[01:12:07.681 --> 01:12:09.823]  Okay, and I'm sure you've seen that.
[01:12:10.163 --> 01:12:18.209]  So the point here is, and then what happens is, Davis and others, and I know she's just focusing on one area, they just leave it that, hey, there were Iraqis there.
[01:12:18.549 --> 01:12:22.672]  Yes, but they're not Saddam's Iraqis, they were Bill Clinton's, i.e.
[01:12:22.732 --> 01:12:30.898]  the New World Order's Iraqis, and why they didn't decide to play that card and go, oh my gosh, Saddam attacked us, that was the plan.
[01:12:31.058 --> 01:12:33.099]  But, I do know the reason.
[01:12:33.219 --> 01:12:37.022]  State police and local police were surveilling them and knew all about it,
[01:12:37.856 --> 01:13:00.571]  So the Feds couldn't stage that event and claim that they had escaped, because then state police at the airport demanded that the police at the airport arrest them, and they stopped these Iraqis with the jogging suits, with the materials, in their bomb-making materials, in the duffel bags, and then Bill Clinton ordered them released.
[01:13:01.338 --> 01:13:09.024]  And this is all on the record, so the Feds couldn't then blame Iraq with it, because their hired Arab terrorists were caught red-handed.
[01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:10.785]  This is absolutely confirmed.
[01:13:10.965 --> 01:13:12.407]  So there, I just gave you the big picture.
[01:13:12.427 --> 01:13:18.471]  Yeah, you did a good summary there for the listening audience, and she did bring up what are basically, what are called, quote, Lilly Whites.
[01:13:19.152 --> 01:13:27.238]  They're, you know, non-Arabic type people that are being dragged into, you know, the Al-Qaeda, anti-Western, anti-US movement.
[01:13:28.615 --> 01:13:30.415]  Again, two years ago I said that would happen.
[01:13:30.455 --> 01:13:35.176]  They would play the Iraq card and then claim that they're working with right-wingers in America.
[01:13:35.236 --> 01:13:44.678]  That was the plan back in 95 to have McVeigh create the history by visiting every right-wing group in the country and then so they could have a massive sweep.
[01:13:44.978 --> 01:13:46.859]  Oh yeah, I've been listening to you now for a good six or so years.
[01:13:46.939 --> 01:13:50.219]  And I said that they would bring this out when they were running and now they're doing it.
[01:13:50.279 --> 01:13:52.460]  You were right on the head.
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:54.100]  Okay, for those that didn't join us,
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:59.266]  Okay, you conducted an interview with Lieutenant Randall Demoff, who was the aide-de-camp there for the general, I guess the adjutant general.
[01:14:12.112 --> 01:14:13.674]  Uh, of the state of Alabama.
[01:14:14.095 --> 01:14:22.344]  And, uh, why I'm calling is, uh, I've been aware of these organizations now since about 1997 as a result of having visited some relatives, a younger brother.
[01:14:27.683 --> 01:14:31.604]  These are not state guard out helping with fires and earthquakes or hurricanes.
[01:14:31.624 --> 01:14:35.606]  This is state guard on the street corners searching eight-year-olds' bags.
[01:14:35.806 --> 01:14:38.327]  We have their own photos from their own website.
[01:14:38.347 --> 01:14:48.910]  They have their own private armored vehicles and their own military police bands on their arms at football games everywhere, searching the public, training us how to be slaves.
[01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:49.271]  Go ahead.
[01:14:51.158 --> 01:14:54.321]  I attended a gun show in Nashville with a brother that lives up there.
[01:14:54.542 --> 01:15:00.848]  He was an NCO in the real American Army and served in the Gulf War, number one, as an NCO.
[01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:12.120]  At a gun show, the Tennessee State Guard was recruiting, and he joined, he served as a captain with them, and I remember at the
[01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:20.079]  Arcadelfia Stadium, I was up there in 99, he was in charge of a small detail that did a similar thing.
[01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:21.180]  Now this is well before 9-11.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:31.686]  I've got interviews with Marine Corps Special Forces Force Recon guys assigned in 1989 to kick down gun dealers doors in Virginia.
[01:15:34.136 --> 01:15:40.158]  A lot of these people I've met at times when I've been up there and my brother tried to get me interested in it.
[01:15:41.018 --> 01:15:43.278]  I do have a military background myself.
[01:15:43.378 --> 01:15:50.300]  I was a warrant officer in the 310th Battalion of the 800th Military Police Brigade, the very one that's now in trouble over there in the Iraq War.
[01:15:53.747 --> 01:16:02.355]  Um, but I wasn't interested, and I think my brother's losing interest also because he's saying that this is something that's not exactly what he was envisioning.
[01:16:02.395 --> 01:16:06.498]  Well, I mean, this is Nazi Germany where they just hand out uniforms to anybody.
[01:16:07.119 --> 01:16:11.403]  No police training, and they're out searching people's bags now on city streets.
[01:16:11.643 --> 01:16:12.664]  Gotta let you go.
[01:16:12.984 --> 01:16:13.785]  Great points.
[01:16:14.125 --> 01:16:15.506]  Bob, I appreciate the call.
[01:16:15.526 --> 01:16:19.110]  Let's talk to Moe in Texas and Robert, Marion, and others.
[01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:20.431]  Go ahead, Moe.
[01:16:21.525 --> 01:16:37.199]  Hey Alex, just want to say many things we could yak for 80 years but just to remind everybody what we already know is that there's not really a problem with overpopulations of prisons until I'm in prison.
[01:16:37.839 --> 01:16:41.242]  There's not really a problem with food shortage until I'm hungry.
[01:16:42.804 --> 01:16:45.246]  And just a taste of power
[01:16:46.348 --> 01:16:54.890]  Like you say, we'll just bring out the absolute worst in folks, and a lot of people slaver after that, and delight in that.
[01:16:58.671 --> 01:17:02.572]  And it is training everybody to be slaves.
[01:17:03.912 --> 01:17:14.455]  The Cigar Aficionado article, Tommy Franks, when they asked him, what was the tone like when you received the news about the Twin Towers?
[01:17:15.228 --> 01:17:19.089]  His conversation, and he says twice, business-like.
[01:17:19.289 --> 01:17:20.489]  It was all business-like.
[01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:21.650]  Very business-like.
[01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:28.571]  And now, two nights ago on Fox News, and we have the clip, we're going to play it, he said, oh, I just knew four days before the towers were about to be brought down.
[01:17:29.392 --> 01:17:30.932]  They were about to fall in on each other.
[01:17:30.952 --> 01:17:39.194]  I thought nobody knew, nobody ever imagined, nobody ever... And then he goes into how, well, it's sad, but after the next attack, military rule, you know.
[01:17:40.538 --> 01:17:57.488]  Also, something on Revelation of the Method, there's a movie that came out called The Core, and there was, they began saying the American military installed a device at the center of the Earth that would manipulate weather and cause earthquakes, but something went wrong.
[01:17:58.048 --> 01:18:05.432]  So now if you ever talk about some sort of Tesla earthquake device, people can just say, oh man, it's just not enough.
[01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:09.695]  Which in 1997, Secretary of Defense Cohen said they have.
[01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:14.251]  In front of about 10,000 people on C-SPAN, I have a tape of it.
[01:18:14.851 --> 01:18:16.372]  I've heard about Revelation of the Method.
[01:18:16.712 --> 01:18:18.413]  It's like the Long Kiss Goodnight.
[01:18:18.513 --> 01:18:20.374]  In fact, I know we've got that clip in the computer.
[01:18:20.394 --> 01:18:21.835]  I know it's on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:18:22.336 --> 01:18:28.139]  Where the secret government group is going to blow up the World Trade Centers to blame it on foreign enemies for martial law.
[01:18:28.699 --> 01:18:36.744]  And then we have Lone Gunman on Fox, months before 9-11, where the secret government group hijacks a jet to fly to the World Trade Center for a police state.
[01:18:37.504 --> 01:18:39.185]  I mean, they just flaunt it in our face!
[01:18:40.262 --> 01:18:41.826]  Manchurian Candidate coming up.
[01:18:42.006 --> 01:18:45.334]  I'm not sure what that's trying to spin.
[01:18:45.875 --> 01:18:47.258]  Boy, it's an amazing movie.
[01:18:47.479 --> 01:18:47.980]  We'll be back.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:48.341]  Stay with us.

[01:19:04.728 --> 01:19:12.334]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.

[01:19:53.763 --> 01:19:57.664]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:57.884 --> 01:20:10.168]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:10.568 --> 01:20:10.968]  The U.S.
[01:20:11.028 --> 01:20:16.610]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:19.211]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:21.071 --> 01:20:22.152]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:20:22.172 --> 01:20:25.033]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:20:25.133 --> 01:20:31.156]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[01:20:53.132 --> 01:21:00.078]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[01:21:01.339 --> 01:21:05.383]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:21:06.101 --> 01:21:13.162]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:22.804]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:39.251]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748 We're here 24 hours a day.
[01:22:39.271 --> 01:22:39.531]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748
[01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:03.371]  We're about to go to your calls, Robert, Chris and Dan and many others.
[01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:08.353]  We've got Dr. Breeding joining us to talk about some really important information coming up and a bunch of other news.
[01:23:09.133 --> 01:23:18.096]  But my wife just called in, Violet Jones, and she's in North Austin driving down Mopac and saw a black helicopter hovering right over the houses.
[01:23:18.597 --> 01:23:20.597]  We've been having lots of this going on lately.
[01:23:21.778 --> 01:23:22.658]  Honey, what did you see?
[01:23:23.482 --> 01:23:30.928]  Well, that's basically what I saw, and I wish I knew more about what exactly, which type of helicopter it was, but it was a black military helicopter.
[01:23:30.948 --> 01:23:33.551]  Did it look insectoid and small, or was it large?
[01:23:35.492 --> 01:23:38.295]  Uh, well, they all looked large to me, I don't know.
[01:23:38.315 --> 01:23:44.220]  It was, it, it looked like the ones that you have photos of from Police State, uh, 2000.
[01:23:44.961 --> 01:23:45.321]  Kind of.
[01:23:45.541 --> 01:23:46.602]  The ones in the sky.
[01:23:47.603 --> 01:23:48.203]  The big ones?
[01:23:49.404 --> 01:23:49.965]  A Black Hawk?
[01:23:50.615 --> 01:23:51.976]  Yeah, maybe that's what it was.
[01:23:52.016 --> 01:23:53.897]  Now, was it going fast over the houses?
[01:23:53.917 --> 01:23:55.579]  No, it was hovering.
[01:23:55.719 --> 01:23:57.700]  It was hovering over a neighborhood.
[01:23:58.321 --> 01:24:00.902]  Very, very wonderful then.
[01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:05.146]  Did you hear the lieutenant we had on from Alabama?
[01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:09.249]  You know, I'm sorry I missed that because I was in a meeting.
[01:24:09.429 --> 01:24:10.109]  I hear you.
[01:24:10.129 --> 01:24:12.631]  Well, it was a great interview, so thanks for getting him.
[01:24:12.731 --> 01:24:14.152]  Alright, well take care and drive safe.
[01:24:14.612 --> 01:24:15.333]  Thank you.
[01:24:15.413 --> 01:24:15.873]  Bye-bye.
[01:24:15.953 --> 01:24:16.474]  See you, bye.
[01:24:17.575 --> 01:24:19.476]  Let's now go to Robert.
[01:24:20.302 --> 01:24:20.983]  In Colorado.
[01:24:21.003 --> 01:24:21.883]  Thanks for holding, Robert.
[01:24:21.903 --> 01:24:22.463]  You're on the air.
[01:24:24.505 --> 01:24:25.625]  Yes, Robert, you're on the air.
[01:24:25.665 --> 01:24:26.066]  Go ahead.
[01:24:26.286 --> 01:24:27.226]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:24:27.327 --> 01:24:27.607]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:28.167 --> 01:24:32.029]  This is going to be your second military officer calling in for the day's program.
[01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:35.692]  I was deeply disturbed on what I heard from this young man.
[01:24:37.033 --> 01:24:38.494]  But he's getting a job with Homeland Security.
[01:24:38.534 --> 01:24:39.054]  Why does he care?
[01:24:40.195 --> 01:24:44.557]  You know, that's the same thing that happened in Germany in the 30s.
[01:24:44.597 --> 01:24:45.018]  Who cares?
[01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:48.520]  As long as I have a job with the state, with the police, I'm set.
[01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:54.897]  And I speak to this from a point of record that my mother was born in Nuremberg in 1929.
[01:24:56.197 --> 01:24:58.618]  So the similarities are quite striking.
[01:24:59.438 --> 01:25:01.259]  History is definitely repeating itself.
[01:25:01.359 --> 01:25:02.539]  So your father was a G.I.
[01:25:02.559 --> 01:25:03.399]  that married a German?
[01:25:03.519 --> 01:25:03.779]  Yes.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.181]  And I also, as I said, I became a military officer as well.
[01:25:09.301 --> 01:25:11.142]  Commissioned Naval Air Station Pensacola in 1984.
[01:25:16.363 --> 01:25:17.865]  We're here right now.
[01:25:17.885 --> 01:25:20.507]  The infrastructure has been set up for the last 30 years for this.
[01:25:20.567 --> 01:25:20.927]  It's here.
[01:25:22.369 --> 01:25:29.776]  What's going to bring it to an end, I believe, is the fact that pretty much people around the country aren't going to be pushed around like this much longer.
[01:25:31.358 --> 01:25:39.325]  When I see men walking around, parading in military uniforms, giving themselves designations as officers,
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.681]  I'm really enraged.
[01:25:41.921 --> 01:25:47.504]  Oh, by the way, you look at these photos, there's not one of them below Sargent.
[01:25:47.544 --> 01:25:50.066]  Most of them have got General and Captain outfits on.
[01:25:50.086 --> 01:25:58.771]  I mean, literally, in a slovenly, lubberly, stuff hanging out, cell phones hanging on them, hamburgers in one hand, a cigarette in another.
[01:25:59.971 --> 01:26:05.715]  So everyone that's went through the Academy, OCS, and Rossi, basically that was a waste of time for all of us.
[01:26:06.255 --> 01:26:09.457]  If I'd have known that, I'd have just, you know, went ahead and not even bothered.
[01:26:10.329 --> 01:26:14.072]  Uh, that's the absolute ridiculousness of this.
[01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:19.156]  And I don't think, personally, my opinion is Homeland Security is going to fall apart regardless.
[01:26:19.537 --> 01:26:21.979]  But there's not enough money to hold it together.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.741]  And the people are not going to put up with this.
[01:26:24.781 --> 01:26:29.145]  I mean, one of these guys better never run up to me.
[01:26:29.465 --> 01:26:30.506]  Well, that's what I'm telling you.
[01:26:30.566 --> 01:26:39.493]  Imagine trying to go into downtown Mobile and, I mean, literally, just the most slummingly dressed
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:45.362]  People come waddling over to you and start wanting to search your young daughter.
[01:26:45.442 --> 01:26:47.423]  I mean, I don't know what I'd do.
[01:26:47.963 --> 01:26:50.184]  I was grinding my teeth looking at these photos.
[01:26:51.245 --> 01:26:54.406]  Well, you know, like I said, the infrastructure's already been put in place.
[01:26:54.466 --> 01:26:59.348]  My mother said something shortly before her death that this place is turning into Nazi Germany.
[01:27:00.389 --> 01:27:01.469]  I can't remember when she said it.
[01:27:01.509 --> 01:27:06.571]  Have you heard that a national talk show host is basically calling for people to be arrested and for me to be arrested?
[01:27:07.412 --> 01:27:08.392]  It doesn't surprise me.
[01:27:09.445 --> 01:27:11.027]  I'll give you a story that my mother told me.
[01:27:11.067 --> 01:27:12.868]  She had two uncles.
[01:27:13.649 --> 01:27:17.472]  One uncle didn't like the other uncle's political beliefs, turned them in, and they killed him.
[01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:20.534]  We're getting to that stage right now.
[01:27:22.156 --> 01:27:26.980]  And it's sad to see America go through this, but we've got, like I said, the infrastructure's here.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:31.283]  We've got a follower of Leo Strauss that heads our Justice Department.
[01:27:32.044 --> 01:27:33.745]  Leo is a supporter of the Nazis.
[01:27:34.185 --> 01:27:36.828]  We have.
[01:27:37.248 --> 01:27:38.429]  Look who we have as President.
[01:27:39.485 --> 01:27:40.746]  And look at his grandfather.
[01:27:41.126 --> 01:27:41.926]  Look at these men.
[01:27:42.087 --> 01:27:43.167]  Look at their backgrounds.
[01:27:43.427 --> 01:27:49.811]  As a matter of fact, even better yet, we have the son of a Nazi running the fifth largest economy in the world, California.
[01:27:50.992 --> 01:27:53.213]  It's our guy who says he admires Hitler.
[01:27:53.953 --> 01:27:55.954]  So, I mean, the infrastructure's here.
[01:27:57.876 --> 01:28:03.759]  Whether or not it can hold together is the big question, and I have a funny feeling that it's headed for abject failure.
[01:28:04.359 --> 01:28:07.001]  Because, you're right, people are waking up around this country.
[01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:09.398]  And people are extremely upset.
[01:28:09.418 --> 01:28:10.219]  Well, that's what I said.
[01:28:10.419 --> 01:28:16.182]  Real military men and women who are intelligent and know what's happening generally are good people and they're smart enough to see it.
[01:28:16.442 --> 01:28:20.525]  So they have to go hire goons and idiots.
[01:28:21.235 --> 01:28:24.297]  Well, I'm just really curious about, you know, what I just heard.
[01:28:24.577 --> 01:28:27.419]  And, um, I hope people do wake up across this country.
[01:28:27.699 --> 01:28:30.801]  What do you want to say to the control freaks out there that think they're going to take this country down?
[01:28:31.181 --> 01:28:32.082]  It's never going to happen.
[01:28:32.102 --> 01:28:34.744]  You've got too many of us out here who've really been trained.
[01:28:35.184 --> 01:28:36.005]  So, be careful.
[01:28:36.505 --> 01:28:37.626]  Guys, really be careful.
[01:28:38.506 --> 01:28:39.107]  Thank you very much.
[01:28:39.227 --> 01:28:39.747]  Take care.
[01:28:39.867 --> 01:28:40.567]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:40.587 --> 01:28:42.609]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:44.790]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:46.851]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:29:04.684 --> 01:29:06.085]  The banks are defrauding you.
[01:29:06.365 --> 01:29:07.706]  Now is the time to fight back.

[01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:48.395]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:53.314 --> 01:30:54.315]  It's finally here!
[01:30:54.435 --> 01:30:55.416]  Spring has arrived!
[01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:58.598]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:58.798 --> 01:31:02.261]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:02.461 --> 01:31:10.627]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:31:36.413 --> 01:31:37.594]  Save money, eat healthy.
[01:31:37.874 --> 01:31:39.695]  Alright, waiting in the wings is Dr. John Breeding.
[01:32:06.903 --> 01:32:30.514]  We're going to talk about how they are going to forcibly, twice a year, we have this out of the major Illinois newspapers, and of course it's been in the Associated Press a few months ago, New Freedom Commission, is calling for the forcible psychological testing twice a year of all the children, then they said, and adults, they're going to start with all pregnant women, by a battery of tests, by, now this is admitted, people going off handbooks written by the pharmacological companies.
[01:32:31.654 --> 01:32:32.675]  This is Brave New World.
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:45.348]  And we're also going to get into these vaccines that then block the receptors in the brain where you can't even get your normal endorphins, quote, so we can't get drug addicted, so we can't be happy, really, without the other drugs they're going to give us that hit other receptors.
[01:32:45.408 --> 01:32:46.429]  That's the plan here.
[01:32:47.649 --> 01:32:48.870]  That's the London Independent, by the way.
[01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:49.991]  We talked about that last week.
[01:32:50.411 --> 01:32:51.932]  Dr. Breeding about to come on with us.
[01:32:52.472 --> 01:32:53.853]  But I said I'd play this clip.
[01:32:54.194 --> 01:32:55.975]  This is from the Long Kiss Goodnight, 1999.
[01:32:56.415 --> 01:32:56.975]  I've got several top
[01:33:01.574 --> 01:33:21.870]  uh... actors uh... in it and uh... at the end of it uh... the the the government official is it says that that we're going to blow up the world trade center to you know get our police state in our weapons sales and again there's a bunch of movies that say this the government's going to blow it up to get a police state to sell weapons
[01:33:22.423 --> 01:33:32.671]  It was on the lone gunman on Fox, you know, the secret government group hijacks a plane by remote control to fly it into the World Trade Center to have martial law and to attack Iraq, to attack the Middle East.
[01:33:34.513 --> 01:33:35.373]  Why did they do this?
[01:33:35.473 --> 01:33:36.494]  Why do they flaunt it?
[01:33:36.775 --> 01:33:38.556]  But here's that long kiss goodnight clip.
[01:33:38.576 --> 01:33:40.618]  Here it is.
[01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:43.600]  Is that a fun reason?
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:43.600]  1993.
[01:33:45.061 --> 01:33:47.063]  World Trade Center bombing, remember?
[01:33:49.488 --> 01:33:53.409]  During the trial, one of the bombers claimed the CIA had advanced knowledge.
[01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:59.790]  The diplomat who issued the terrorist visa was CIA.
[01:34:00.711 --> 01:34:06.052]  It's not unthinkable they paved the way for the bombing, purely to justify a budget increase.
[01:34:06.592 --> 01:34:11.113]  You're telling me that you're going to fake some terrorist thing just to get some money out of Congress?
[01:34:11.193 --> 01:34:15.354]  Well, unfortunately, Mr. Hennessey, I have no idea how to fake killing 4,000 people.
[01:34:16.895 --> 01:34:18.435]  So we're just going to have to do it for real.
[01:34:20.188 --> 01:34:27.410]  So he's chained up under the World Trade Center, the New World Order boss,
[01:34:42.637 --> 01:34:43.959]  He's flying off on his chopper.
[01:34:43.979 --> 01:34:45.922]  They're going to blow it up and kill 4,000 people.
[01:34:46.363 --> 01:34:46.503]  Oh!
[01:34:46.883 --> 01:34:49.287]  Almost the number you actually did get, didn't you?
[01:34:50.028 --> 01:34:51.390]  And there's all these movies.
[01:34:51.410 --> 01:34:59.041]  Oh, and now we have Tommy Franks, we're going to play the clip next hour, saying that four days before 9-11 he just knew the towers were about to fall down.
[01:35:00.222 --> 01:35:01.943]  But nobody had paranoia, I thought.
[01:35:02.123 --> 01:35:03.164]  But you're just out bragging.
[01:35:03.224 --> 01:35:04.264]  It's so funny.
[01:35:04.304 --> 01:35:05.805]  And martial law is coming.
[01:35:05.825 --> 01:35:07.085]  You're real sad about it.
[01:35:07.166 --> 01:35:11.748]  And now they've got goons out in uniforms and military police outfits.
[01:35:11.768 --> 01:35:15.950]  You want to go sign up all over the country to go search people on the street corners.
[01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:19.432]  Search little girls, little boys, training them how to be a slave.
[01:35:20.032 --> 01:35:21.613]  Real quick, let's finish with these calls.
[01:35:22.569 --> 01:35:23.669]  Those have been holding the longest.
[01:35:23.749 --> 01:35:25.630]  Chris in Kentucky, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:35:25.650 --> 01:35:27.050]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:35:27.331 --> 01:35:27.611]  Good.
[01:35:27.851 --> 01:35:29.871]  Thanks for this and thanks Robert for coming out.
[01:35:30.231 --> 01:35:31.992]  I got something on junk mail here.
[01:35:32.012 --> 01:35:35.573]  It's kind of terrorist from investment tracker about the mesh system security.
[01:35:36.313 --> 01:35:37.034]  Not aware of it.
[01:35:37.854 --> 01:35:41.295]  Yeah, and they want to put it with how good it is with Homeland Security and here's more.
[01:35:41.355 --> 01:35:47.757]  Oh yeah, type in Patriot Act compliance in a search engine, thousands of links and everything being tracked and traced, all part of freedom.
[01:35:48.117 --> 01:35:49.817]  All part of freedom, it certainly is.
[01:35:50.438 --> 01:35:50.958]  And I tell you,
[01:35:51.877 --> 01:35:56.759]  That last call you had on the lieutenant, he needs to be deprogrammed big time.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:00.721]  And he's not a bad person, but you know he's been programmed for all this.
[01:36:00.761 --> 01:36:02.902]  Well he says he's getting a homeland security job.
[01:36:02.922 --> 01:36:04.843]  That's what this is all about.
[01:36:04.883 --> 01:36:05.683]  Yeah.
[01:36:06.324 --> 01:36:12.326]  Serve as a street minion and later he gets promoted on up to a higher level.
[01:36:12.907 --> 01:36:15.128]  Higher levels and go to the malls.
[01:36:15.188 --> 01:36:16.228]  It's just part of your freedom.
[01:36:16.268 --> 01:36:18.229]  Little kids being searched, it's part of your new freedom.
[01:36:18.909 --> 01:36:19.570]  New conditioning.
[01:36:21.092 --> 01:36:24.533]  Just so good, and just so, you know, if you believe in the Bible, you're a terrorist now.
[01:36:24.553 --> 01:36:25.934]  And it's just incredible.
[01:36:25.974 --> 01:36:29.095]  And you know, the other thing is, they don't use the term terrorist.
[01:36:29.475 --> 01:36:30.035]  Criminal.
[01:36:30.215 --> 01:36:31.136]  You're guilty if you're proven.
[01:36:31.236 --> 01:36:31.796]  Oh, you heard him.
[01:36:31.816 --> 01:36:37.518]  We're looking for beer, and guns, and drugs, and when we search people's backpacks, and I thought it's for terror.
[01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:40.299]  Well, it's for that too, but we're looking for contraband.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.063]  Just like our local TV show when they have the FBI agent named Mr. Buyer on there.
[01:36:45.103 --> 01:36:50.027]  So any suspicious activity, criminal activity, just buying certain things looks suspicious.
[01:36:50.227 --> 01:36:53.670]  Now we're going to recruit all the people that come in your house and service people to spy on you.
[01:36:54.311 --> 01:36:56.232]  It's just such freedom.
[01:36:56.713 --> 01:36:59.555]  When you're not at home sneaking peek, that's freedom for your safety.
[01:36:59.755 --> 01:37:04.359]  And now I've got the Hilton Hotel fax from an employee.
[01:37:05.362 --> 01:37:14.569]  Uh, that was hung up on the bulletin board and just says, uh, try to get everybody's face on the new cameras we put in and while the car is in the parking garage, uh, be sure and search it.
[01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:19.773]  Actually, just go out there and search it if you can get in the car and look for anything suspicious.
[01:37:20.214 --> 01:37:21.014]  Yeah, public parks.
[01:37:21.294 --> 01:37:21.815]  Search your car.
[01:37:21.855 --> 01:37:22.816]  You're a terrorist sitting there.
[01:37:22.916 --> 01:37:23.656]  You look suspicious.
[01:37:23.676 --> 01:37:25.418]  Let's just forget this for the moment.
[01:37:26.138 --> 01:37:27.019]  Chris, thanks for the call.
[01:37:27.539 --> 01:37:28.980]  Dan in Colorado.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:29.721]  We're going to our guest.
[01:37:29.761 --> 01:37:30.321]  Dan, go ahead.
[01:37:30.341 --> 01:37:31.322]  Hello.
[01:37:32.822 --> 01:37:33.483]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:33.603 --> 01:37:40.768]  There's only two sides I see, and that's the side that, uh, there are those who oppress, those who help the oppressor.
[01:37:41.609 --> 01:37:47.094]  And then the other side is those who will seek to defend those from oppression.
[01:37:47.774 --> 01:37:54.560]  There are no, I don't see, there's a, there's a religious side that says love your neighbor as yourself, and there's the other side that oppresses.
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:56.181]  I see that as a mistake.
[01:37:56.241 --> 01:37:59.203]  Yeah, you've got, you've got the predators and you've got the sheep.
[01:37:59.504 --> 01:38:02.326]  And I see, I see millions of our own
[01:38:03.127 --> 01:38:08.511]  Government representatives who side with the people free from oppression.
[01:38:10.031 --> 01:38:23.940]  And what I've shared with dozens of police officers and hundreds of other people so far, with great success, is that the police officers, when they leave their home, they need a refuge in order to say no.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.502]  They can't go to work for them.
[01:38:26.522 --> 01:38:27.502]  You know, explain that.
[01:38:27.542 --> 01:38:28.983]  You've called before about this.
[01:38:29.063 --> 01:38:30.664]  Yes, I always get it at the end.
[01:38:32.307 --> 01:38:35.989]  So, in this case... Well, sir, explain what a refuge means.
[01:38:36.549 --> 01:38:36.889]  Okay.
[01:38:37.730 --> 01:38:42.712]  When they go to work, it's their neighborhood's job to make sure their family's safe.
[01:38:43.412 --> 01:38:48.475]  So that he can go and say no, and do his work he's supposed to do without being compromised.
[01:38:48.515 --> 01:38:52.337]  Well, it's our job to protect, sir, it's our job to protect all our neighbors.
[01:38:52.357 --> 01:38:52.857]  Exactly.
[01:38:53.577 --> 01:38:58.640]  So, if, now see, in other words, I share the message that when
[01:38:59.676 --> 01:39:02.738]  When a congressman goes to work, he needs his family safe at home.
[01:39:03.719 --> 01:39:11.425]  Well, the day that that unites, then the bad would be surrounded by that goodness too, and then they'll fear voting wrong.
[01:39:12.386 --> 01:39:16.009]  Sir, I hear you, I gotta go to our guest, but thank you for the call.
[01:39:16.029 --> 01:39:17.050]  Uh, listen.
[01:39:18.191 --> 01:39:21.653]  When you drive down the street at night, all the windows glow blue.
[01:39:22.214 --> 01:39:27.278]  Everybody's watching their big screen TVs, nobody knows their neighbor, most people don't, and growing up,
[01:39:28.061 --> 01:39:29.842]  I mean, I remember everybody knew the neighbors.
[01:39:29.862 --> 01:39:33.364]  You were constantly eating at your neighbor's house, barbecuing.
[01:39:34.365 --> 01:39:35.766]  Neighbors watched out for each other.
[01:39:36.066 --> 01:39:39.948]  Now I try to talk to my neighbors and they'll talk, but they're busy.
[01:39:40.728 --> 01:39:41.989]  They don't talk to their other neighbors.
[01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:42.730]  It's not just me.
[01:39:43.170 --> 01:39:44.431]  They're all in their own little world.
[01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:47.253]  People don't have real friends anymore.
[01:39:47.293 --> 01:39:48.915]  They have the TV show friends.
[01:39:49.255 --> 01:39:50.617]  They have their virtual friends.
[01:39:51.037 --> 01:39:55.762]  And so what you're saying in a bigger paradigm is, we've got to get back to real community.
[01:39:55.822 --> 01:40:00.287]  We've got to, you know, get back to truly being involved.
[01:40:00.507 --> 01:40:07.755]  And the globalists know we have this hunger for community, so they're giving us the false community of the Homeland Security, Neighborhood Watch, Police State.
[01:40:08.399 --> 01:40:12.922]  And we've got to stand up against that counterfeit community and create our own community against the New World Order.
[01:40:13.222 --> 01:40:20.766]  And somebody who's part of that real patriotic community is Dr. John Breeding, psychologist, author, lecturer, award-winning researcher.
[01:40:22.427 --> 01:40:26.229]  We carry several of his books on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:40:26.710 --> 01:40:31.092]  And he's here to talk with us today about a lot of different issues, but Dr. Breeding, community.
[01:40:31.152 --> 01:40:37.616]  I mean, how important is it to really know your neighbors and to really get involved at the grassroots level?
[01:40:38.777 --> 01:40:52.940]  Well, I was just listening to you, Alex, and it reminded me of why I like you so much, you know, because you just brought it right to the heart of the matter in my mind, you know, which is that so much of what we're seeing is the result of a breakdown of community.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:58.461]  It's been pretty systematically done, and it really isolates people.
[01:40:58.541 --> 01:41:06.563]  It makes people fearful, and I like the way you described the idea of creating a counterfeit or an artificial community.
[01:41:07.516 --> 01:41:10.357]  It's a replacement that's really a pretty pathetic substitute.
[01:41:10.377 --> 01:41:17.239]  That's definitely true in thinking about issues in regards to my so-called mental health field.
[01:41:17.479 --> 01:41:34.703]  Even counseling, which is relatively benign compared to a lot of the things we're going to be talking about, like psychiatric drugs and electroshock, even that is still basically a commodification of attention that should be garnered in a real community of friends and family.
[01:41:35.855 --> 01:41:38.016]  Well, I mean, as you said, it is the heart of the matter.
[01:42:01.064 --> 01:42:13.156]  People, again, have these fake communal experiences at football games and at these corrupt, controlled churches, but they don't have community with their family, with their friends, their neighbors anymore.
[01:42:13.597 --> 01:42:23.046]  I guess the bars are about as close as you get to that, and that's a... The bars, and then you have, as you mentioned, television, you know, you could also mention the computer,
[01:42:24.898 --> 01:42:41.702]  You know, and even your work and my work has an edge to it in the sense that a lot of people can get at least a sense of community by connecting with you and your radio show and this coalition around the world of people who are trying to defend freedom.
[01:42:41.762 --> 01:42:45.343]  And that's very important for information and for community and for support.
[01:42:45.843 --> 01:42:50.864]  But it's also, there's also another level which is actually dealing with the people
[01:42:51.738 --> 01:42:57.482]  In your street, in your neighborhood, in your workplace, you know, and actually connecting to them on a real deep level.
[01:42:57.522 --> 01:43:02.326]  Well, they've tried to destroy the truth-seeking, freedom-loving community.
[01:43:02.386 --> 01:43:14.134]  They've tried to use demonization terms, but it isn't working anymore, and I see the community encountering corruption, exploding right now, and I think that's why they're panicking and trying to put in all these controls.
[01:43:15.035 --> 01:43:16.256]  Well, I hope you're right.
[01:43:16.296 --> 01:43:17.957]  You know, I'm always looking for
[01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:20.331]  I don't think so.
[01:43:20.391 --> 01:43:21.032]  I don't think so.
[01:43:47.162 --> 01:43:50.164]  Well, let's give folks some background and then we'll go through this.
[01:43:50.584 --> 01:43:51.605]  Ten states have it.
[01:43:51.645 --> 01:43:52.765]  It's going nationwide.
[01:43:52.825 --> 01:43:54.186]  Billions of federal funds.
[01:43:54.967 --> 01:44:00.310]  And now Illinois repeated what the feds just said a month and a half ago.
[01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:01.870]  This all started in Texas.
[01:44:01.891 --> 01:44:03.732]  This is the beta test right here in Austin, folks.
[01:44:04.712 --> 01:44:09.595]  Decades ago, actually, I was part of this before I graduated and didn't even know it.
[01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:13.351]  You'll be forced to be psychologically tested twice a year.
[01:44:13.751 --> 01:44:15.212]  Then it's going to be adults, too.
[01:44:15.572 --> 01:44:19.393]  Now they're announcing it's going to be for pregnant mothers, starting with the adults in Illinois.
[01:44:19.413 --> 01:44:25.975]  And in the Illinois newspapers, and this is on Infowars.com right now, they report it.
[01:44:27.170 --> 01:44:31.674]  Yeah, well, you're talking about the way this was set up, and it did flow from Texas to a large extent.
[01:44:31.854 --> 01:44:34.497]  Well, first of all, the new Freedom Commission is this
[01:44:53.212 --> 01:45:09.317]  There's this group of 20 some odd so-called experts that were appointed by the President that came out with this report in July that emphasizes that early assessment and treatment is critical across the lifespan.
[01:45:09.717 --> 01:45:14.819]  That childhood disorders must be treated or else there's going to be this downward spiral.
[01:45:16.479 --> 01:45:18.560]  We have to prevent these mental health problems.
[01:45:19.190 --> 01:45:19.730]  I think we're good.
[01:45:40.027 --> 01:45:42.389]  Attend over 114,000 schools.
[01:45:42.849 --> 01:45:49.274]  When combined with the 6 million adults working at these schools, almost one-fifth of the population passes through the nation's schools every day.
[01:45:49.854 --> 01:45:58.540]  And the recommendation is, as you say, to test literally every one of these 58 million people to come up with different diagnostic categories.
[01:45:59.621 --> 01:46:04.104]  And then these are linked to something that did flow out of Texas.
[01:46:04.204 --> 01:46:08.207]  It's called the Texas Medical Algorithm Project, TMAP for short.
[01:46:08.911 --> 01:46:19.203]  This was a consortium of Big Pharma together with mental health people and they came up with basically different so called logarithms that basically say if you have this mental illness then this drug.
[01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:24.513]  If that drug doesn't work, try that drug instead.
[01:46:24.613 --> 01:46:29.436]  And they're creating dozens of new categories, so they ask the 12-year-old, are you depressed?
[01:46:29.476 --> 01:46:31.798]  Well, yeah, most 12-year-olds go through weird feelings.
[01:46:31.838 --> 01:46:32.198]  Yes.
[01:46:32.518 --> 01:46:34.659]  Okay, you're going to go on an anti-psychotic now.
[01:46:34.699 --> 01:46:37.961]  They even list the drugs, the new expensive patented drugs.
[01:46:37.981 --> 01:46:42.064]  The new expensive drugs that were lobbied for by the drug companies.
[01:46:42.244 --> 01:46:42.744]  Think about this.
[01:46:42.824 --> 01:46:49.369]  They're turning our schools, not just into prisons, but now Manchurian Canaday brainwashing drugging centers.
[01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:51.130]  I'm not joking.
[01:46:51.170 --> 01:46:52.071]  No, you're not joking.
[01:46:52.111 --> 01:46:57.234]  There's already about 9 or 10 million school-aged children in the United States on psychiatric drugs.
[01:46:57.294 --> 01:46:59.576]  That's at least 15% of the population.
[01:46:59.856 --> 01:47:00.957]  And that's not enough.
[01:47:01.717 --> 01:47:03.298]  So now they want to go in.
[01:47:03.999 --> 01:47:05.400]  It's the ideal scenario.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:09.142]  Go in and have access to everybody in that population.
[01:47:10.923 --> 01:47:13.045]  And expand the market even further.
[01:47:13.105 --> 01:47:14.066]  It's unbelievable.
[01:47:14.326 --> 01:47:19.070]  And it's presented in this rhetoric of, oh, we need to prevent these problems before they get worse.
[01:47:19.210 --> 01:47:25.516]  And now they're going to send the health department, CPS, to every woman having a child by law.
[01:47:25.896 --> 01:47:27.097]  Illinois is about to pass the law.
[01:47:27.137 --> 01:47:28.118]  Other states are doing it too.
[01:47:28.478 --> 01:47:29.419]  Because they say adults too.
[01:47:29.439 --> 01:47:37.446]  It's going to start with the women and then they come in and surround you and make you take tests and decide if you're allowed to have this child or should this child be set up for drugging later.
[01:47:38.687 --> 01:47:55.810]  I can't... Doctor, this is... They start with the mothers arguing that, you know, the mother has such an impact on the child's development, so they're going to go in and check to make sure all these children have good environments and help their mothers and... Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:47:55.830 --> 01:48:04.792]  And so all the mothers, all the children, all the school employees, basically everybody, and it's unbelievable.
[01:48:04.932 --> 01:48:05.152]  And it's...
[01:48:06.283 --> 01:48:10.333]  The first state to start to implement this is Illinois.
[01:48:10.875 --> 01:48:15.787]  That's why we're mobilizing in Illinois, because if we can stop it in Illinois,
[01:48:16.297 --> 01:48:22.822]  You know, we've got the best chance of... Well, Doctor, I think most people haven't read Brave New World or science fiction books.
[01:48:22.863 --> 01:48:33.231]  I mean, this is literally where they psychiatrically test everyone, and 15% isn't enough to be on the drugs, and they're creating all these things and saying we're all mentally ill.
[01:48:33.752 --> 01:48:41.318]  I mean, this is... and the drug companies have written this, and these new antipsychotics are even worse than serotonin uptake inhibitors.
[01:48:41.358 --> 01:48:42.399]  Can you just talk about that?
[01:48:43.493 --> 01:48:49.978]  Well, we've got about 6 million kids on the stimulants, which is the amphetamine type drugs, like the speed type drugs.
[01:48:50.398 --> 01:49:01.866]  We've got 2 or 3 million on the so-called antidepressants, which is also an amphetamine effect, which often causes suicide, which creates a whole host of problems in the young people who take them.
[01:49:02.246 --> 01:49:05.068]  And then they're bringing in what you're talking about, which is the antipsychotics.
[01:49:05.509 --> 01:49:05.909]  We're good to go!
[01:49:27.211 --> 01:49:29.753]  And they're massively profitable.
[01:49:30.293 --> 01:49:40.400]  And it's set up that the producers of these drugs got their guys on this commission, lined it out, they're just as happy as can be and we're trying to profit.
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:43.381]  Folks, we are entering hell itself.
[01:49:43.722 --> 01:49:46.684]  I am in a nightmare science fiction movie, so are you.
[01:49:47.124 --> 01:49:50.246]  Twilight Zone, we cannot put up with this anymore!
[01:49:53.664 --> 01:50:00.508]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.808 --> 01:50:02.189]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.389 --> 01:50:04.591]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:06.832]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.112 --> 01:50:12.035]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.375 --> 01:50:16.398]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.658 --> 01:50:18.420]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:29.173]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.313 --> 01:50:31.196]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.616 --> 01:50:32.136]  We're good to go.
[01:50:52.722 --> 01:50:55.744]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:56.064 --> 01:51:00.987]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.247 --> 01:51:05.589]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:05.890 --> 01:51:14.795]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.015 --> 01:51:18.617]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:18.917 --> 01:51:23.947]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.248 --> 01:51:30.961]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:32.101]  What about you?
[01:51:32.761 --> 01:51:38.126]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:51:53.786 --> 01:51:54.107]  I think so.
[01:52:09.008 --> 01:52:09.669]  We're good to go.

[01:53:01.969 --> 01:53:03.490]  The levy is breaking.
[01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:05.190]  The tyranny is running wild.
[01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:06.991]  And that happens every time in history.
[01:53:07.471 --> 01:53:08.911]  And they pause to deny that.
[01:53:09.611 --> 01:53:21.075]  Once corruption gets into these ivory towers, and once the public has become decadent and dumbed down enough, it just starts racing like a staph infection through the body.
[01:53:22.235 --> 01:53:23.216]  Like blood poisoning.
[01:53:23.256 --> 01:53:27.297]  I mean, it's just accelerated at warp speed.
[01:53:28.408 --> 01:53:33.811]  And the good news is, though, there is a counter force, an equal or greater reaction to any action.
[01:53:34.932 --> 01:53:38.474]  And, uh, just God bless all of you out there that care about freedom of defiance.
[01:53:38.694 --> 01:53:41.576]  I mean, I can't believe how bad this is, how fast it's moving.
[01:53:42.196 --> 01:53:44.718]  We're going to test you, we're going to put you on deadly antipsychotics.
[01:53:44.738 --> 01:53:46.599]  I mean, these things are admittedly deadly.
[01:53:46.679 --> 01:53:47.860]  Brain damage, people!
[01:53:49.134 --> 01:53:55.399]  Decades ago, they only put somebody who was criminally psychotic trying to kill people, trying to eat their fingers.
[01:53:55.419 --> 01:53:58.442]  You know, who'd had a bad PCP trip on this stuff.
[01:53:58.702 --> 01:54:02.506]  I mean, this brain damage issue, folks, turns you into a grueling zombie.
[01:54:03.006 --> 01:54:04.908]  And I read articles where they're going to put toddlers on this.
[01:54:04.928 --> 01:54:05.889]  In fact, they've already started.
[01:54:08.251 --> 01:54:09.432]  We're about to go back to Dr. Breeding.
[01:54:09.452 --> 01:54:10.593]  Next hour, we'll get to all your calls.
[01:54:10.613 --> 01:54:11.274]  We're going to go over this.
[01:54:11.294 --> 01:54:14.857]  We're also going to talk about the vaccines that go in and reprogram your brain.
[01:54:16.144 --> 01:54:30.894]  Briefly, I've got Dr. Breeding's book, The Wildest Colts Make the Best Horses, about how they target leaders, and Charlie Isby from the Department of Education has these documents, how they try to brainwash and intoxify your children with this deadly Ritalin and other drugs.
[01:54:31.014 --> 01:54:32.155]  Great book, we carry it.
[01:54:32.695 --> 01:54:40.360]  We also have another one of his wonderful books, got a deal on those when you get both, Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order them.
[01:54:41.041 --> 01:54:44.083]  Also, my 9-11 films, Proving Who Really Carried That Out,
[01:54:45.018 --> 01:54:49.801]  With now national talk show host calling for me to be basically arrested for making this film.
[01:54:49.921 --> 01:54:50.782]  It's getting scary, folks.
[01:54:51.062 --> 01:54:54.064]  You need to have this video, make copies of it, get it out to everybody.
[01:54:55.005 --> 01:55:01.469]  Get George Humphrey's new video I'm carrying about 9-11, the great illusion in Game of the Illuminati.
[01:55:02.873 --> 01:55:04.053]  Your choice, fear or love.
[01:55:04.434 --> 01:55:07.034]  Big discounts when you get three or more of any of my films.
[01:55:07.515 --> 01:55:09.815]  Discounts on getting multiple films by other authors.
[01:55:10.496 --> 01:55:16.838]  You can simply go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free to ask questions about specials or to order.
[01:55:17.338 --> 01:55:19.019]  Or to get the mailing address 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:19.039 --> 01:55:19.859]  Please call folks.
[01:55:19.879 --> 01:55:19.939]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:26.441 --> 01:55:34.987]  2-5-3, 3-1-3-9, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:55:36.248 --> 01:55:39.270]  We have got to stand up against these bullies now!
[01:55:40.050 --> 01:55:43.853]  In an aggressive, focused fashion, or it is over!
[01:55:45.118 --> 01:55:45.758]  I'm serious.
[01:55:45.818 --> 01:55:47.719]  And don't cower in fear and think that protects you.
[01:55:48.199 --> 01:55:53.960]  Cowering to this thing, denying it, will destroy us and our children and their children and their children's futures.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.740]  This is for all the marbles.
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:56.680]  So 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:10.683]  Dr. Braden, we've just got a few minutes left before we end this hour, but we're going to get more into this new freedom situation, how to fight it in Illinois, then the vaccines, but what are some other key points of this new freedom situation?
[01:56:11.643 --> 01:56:12.983]  Well, to tie it into
[01:56:14.093 --> 01:56:33.705]  To your work and what you're talking about, what happens when you get mental health screening of everybody, everywhere, and particularly young people in the schools here, is that you can basically count on it that it's basically reinforcing what is the party line in terms of the federal belief system.
[01:56:34.126 --> 01:56:42.471]  So that if you're out of line with that, if you have a belief or behavior that's not compatible with what you're supposed to believe or behave, then
[01:56:43.004 --> 01:56:44.064]  Thank you for having me.
[01:56:57.150 --> 01:57:05.576]  You know, so you're graded under the lifelong learning skills and under the category of tolerance, and that comes in even before the academic things come in.
[01:57:05.596 --> 01:57:16.383]  And again, that sounds all good and liberal, but again, it's like commissars looking at your thought process, your political views, and it's like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany where, oh, where'd Bob go?
[01:57:16.403 --> 01:57:17.324]  Well, he's crazy.
[01:57:17.624 --> 01:57:18.725]  He doesn't like the government.
[01:57:19.145 --> 01:57:26.387]  Yeah, it comes up, I mean any kind of oppression, somebody used the term oppression on the call a while ago, any kind of oppression always has a claim to virtue.
[01:57:26.687 --> 01:57:35.409]  So it sounds good, we're treating sick kids, we're preventing deterioration, but the truth is basically you're actively looking for something that doesn't exist.
[01:57:35.489 --> 01:57:38.769]  In this case it's called, and this is where it ties into the eugenics.
[01:57:38.869 --> 01:57:41.330]  We've got a break, we'll come back with that in a third hour, stay with us.
[01:57:50.111 --> 01:57:54.294]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.934 --> 01:57:55.795]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.535 --> 01:57:57.436]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.096 --> 01:58:01.759]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.279 --> 01:58:06.422]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.243 --> 01:58:12.706]  We're talking to a good friend of mine, a man I respect who has great knowledge about
[01:58:13.912 --> 01:58:23.420]  The destruction of the human fabric, our basic programming and layout being re-engineered with scientific evil and precision.
[01:58:24.761 --> 01:58:31.526]  We're talking about the new Freedom Commission to test all the children, then all the adults, twice a year, forcibly drug you, en masse.
[01:58:32.167 --> 01:58:33.488]  We're moving into some other issues.
[01:58:33.508 --> 01:58:34.429]  Your call's coming up.
[01:58:34.509 --> 01:58:36.851]  Also, this Fox News clip about how wonderful martial law is.
[01:58:37.671 --> 01:58:39.553]  That's coming up, too, to analyze that.
[01:58:41.295 --> 01:58:50.418]  But Dr. Breeding was getting into, oh, all these new psychological evaluations, or, you don't love the state, you don't love the, you're mentally ill, and that's already starting.
[01:58:50.958 --> 01:58:52.659]  And again, the Soviets, the Nazis did this.
[01:58:52.719 --> 01:58:53.619]  Please continue, Doctor.
[01:58:54.359 --> 01:59:07.263]  Well, the, the, so the dynamic is, is that, you know, you don't love the state, you know, means you, you challenge any of the state's decisions about what's in your best interest.
[01:59:07.659 --> 01:59:11.621]  So the state decides what's in your best interest, what's in the best interest of your children.
[01:59:11.981 --> 01:59:21.564]  That's what we've been trying to defend and protect against is to say, let parents care for their children, let children be themselves without your wanting to drug them and that kind of thing.
[01:59:21.944 --> 01:59:32.769]  And now they've found a way because they've got this level of political power and it's gotten to the point where world corporate is basically calling the shots.
[01:59:32.989 --> 01:59:36.290]  So in this case, Big Pharma comes in, it lays out the whole program.
[01:59:36.863 --> 01:59:37.323]  I think so.
[02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:02.611]  I don't
[02:00:23.607 --> 02:00:32.576]  Do our best to allow children to grow up as free-thinking beings so that we'll at least have them as spiritual beings and as resources and as freedom fighters.
[02:00:32.636 --> 02:00:38.021]  Well, Dr. Breeding, I mean, the term insane or mentally ill hasn't even existed very long.
[02:00:38.042 --> 02:00:44.108]  I mean, sometimes people had real neurological problems or were poisoned or ate bad food and people had problems and had to get treatment.
[02:00:44.488 --> 02:00:47.231]  But now to say that we're all basically mentally ill,
[02:00:48.071 --> 02:00:51.434]  I mean, how do we ever survive without Prozac and Ritalin trees?
[02:00:51.895 --> 02:00:56.619]  I mean, how does any mammal, how do the whales survive and not be depressed?
[02:00:56.879 --> 02:00:59.641]  Maybe we should start drugging the whales and the birds.
[02:00:59.681 --> 02:01:01.743]  I mean, don't we all need these drugs?
[02:01:02.464 --> 02:01:03.965]  Don't we all need these drugs?
[02:01:04.005 --> 02:01:05.686]  That's exactly the argument.
[02:01:08.208 --> 02:01:15.895]  And that's what happens when you bring in the vaccines that you were talking about, you know, where you give these alleged vaccines or viruses to children to prevent
[02:01:17.181 --> 02:01:39.634]  You know these plans that are being developed, but basically what they do is a similar effect to the psychiatric drugs in that they alter the brain dynamics so that you aren't able to take up these endorphin type products or these different neurotransmitter type products and so you can't presumably get high.
[02:01:40.115 --> 02:01:41.996]  You know that means you not only cannot get high
[02:01:42.679 --> 02:01:43.039]  Thank you.
[02:01:58.260 --> 02:01:59.761]  Of a corporate profit margin.
[02:01:59.801 --> 02:02:01.443]  Well, it's total enslavement.
[02:02:01.463 --> 02:02:08.108]  I mean, if they can't get us on welfare, or can't get us in the criminal justice system, or they can't financially get control of us, it's going to be your own mental ill.
[02:02:08.128 --> 02:02:08.929]  We've got to put you on this.
[02:02:08.989 --> 02:02:10.810]  And let's come back and get into these.
[02:02:11.291 --> 02:02:18.276]  And the British government wants to back up the law to give children a shot that blocks nicotine, cocaine, and heroin, but also blocks a lot of your endorphins.
[02:02:18.696 --> 02:02:22.800]  And this will actually change the brain chemistry and get more into the new Freedom Commission.
[02:02:23.667 --> 02:02:29.352]  The fight that's starting in Illinois over this, and then we'll go to Johnny and Lee and John and many others.
[02:02:29.813 --> 02:02:31.795]  We want to talk to Dr. Breeding.
[02:02:32.275 --> 02:02:33.717]  It's 800-259-9231.
[02:02:34.097 --> 02:02:36.079]  Long segment coming up, so please stay with us.

[02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:50.551]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:04:50.751 --> 02:04:56.493]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.

[02:05:40.073 --> 02:05:41.595]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:41.755 --> 02:05:43.858]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:05:46.798 --> 02:05:52.842]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.442 --> 02:05:56.484]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.026 --> 02:06:01.208]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:06:01.968 --> 02:06:06.011]  And again, I've already stated this, but let me try to say it a little bit in a more focused fashion.
[02:06:07.652 --> 02:06:09.873]  Imagine going and buying an $8 ticket,
[02:06:12.210 --> 02:06:28.195]  And getting your popcorn and going in and sitting down and you see a science fiction movie where everyone is tested for mental illness, they're drugging, 15% of the population isn't enough, they want to boost that, deadly drugs that turn you into zombies.
[02:06:28.936 --> 02:06:32.937]  They then come out and say we want every child to take a vaccination against
[02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:34.300]  Drugs.
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:55.172]  Well, there's a reason that that drug is able to make you feel euphoric, because those receptors are there for chemicals in your body that your body is designed to work off of when you take a walk in the woods, or you have your child, or your child makes a straight A, or you see a beautiful sunset, whatever.
[02:06:55.672 --> 02:06:58.294]  I mean, that's... you're supposed to feel like that.
[02:06:58.394 --> 02:07:00.015]  I mean, I feel good fighting this right now.
[02:07:00.055 --> 02:07:10.881]  My brain is rewarding me for standing up against evil, because my programming, my real, you know, genetic mindset and code knows a threat, and I feel good when I fight a threat.
[02:07:11.201 --> 02:07:13.082]  That's how it's supposed to work, folks.
[02:07:14.223 --> 02:07:14.943]  But no, no, no.
[02:07:15.023 --> 02:07:22.408]  They admit... I've been researching this for years, that when they give you these drugs, it plugs up your receptors, and it says a virus goes in,
[02:07:23.539 --> 02:07:29.404]  And creates, has a reaction with the cells in the nerve endings and actually creates a protein plaque!
[02:07:30.225 --> 02:07:31.386]  In your brain!
[02:07:32.714 --> 02:07:38.318]  And folks, they approved Prozac knowing it increased suicide back in the early 1980s.
[02:07:38.358 --> 02:07:39.118]  I've seen the documents.
[02:07:39.378 --> 02:07:40.459]  And now it's all come out again.
[02:07:40.799 --> 02:07:47.763]  They approved FinFin that makes your heart valves turn into chalk and your heart explode.
[02:07:47.783 --> 02:07:49.204]  I mean, all this stuff.
[02:07:49.665 --> 02:07:56.509]  And they just come right out and say, we're going to inject every child in Britain, and they're talking about it in the US, with this stuff and they won't be addicted to drugs anymore.
[02:07:56.529 --> 02:07:57.329]  Won't that be great?
[02:07:57.409 --> 02:07:58.870]  Yeah, it'll fry their brain!
[02:08:00.738 --> 02:08:03.061]  Again, I do not have words to describe.
[02:08:03.461 --> 02:08:04.903]  Imagine a science fiction movie.
[02:08:04.943 --> 02:08:05.403]  Well, guess what?
[02:08:05.423 --> 02:08:10.809]  There's a new movie coming out called Code 64 with some really big actors.
[02:08:10.829 --> 02:08:13.832]  What's the guy's name from the Shawshank Redemption?
[02:08:16.365 --> 02:08:20.509]  He's in it, and he's a cop, and they give him a virus to change his brain.
[02:08:20.529 --> 02:08:28.575]  Everybody takes viruses now, and there's police state and checkpoints, and the virus changes his brain to give him all these powers, and oh, it's so good to have the virus.
[02:08:29.296 --> 02:08:32.519]  Dr. Breeding, please get into this for folks, and this was in the London Independent.
[02:08:32.759 --> 02:08:33.740]  You could do a search on it.
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:35.101]  There's a lot of stories about this.
[02:08:35.381 --> 02:08:42.407]  A lot of medical journals saying it's very, very dangerous, but, I mean, you're a psychologist, a doctor, and you've studied this for decades.
[02:08:42.427 --> 02:08:43.628]  Can you break this down for us?
[02:08:45.032 --> 02:08:50.377]  Yeah, and also I have a question that I have for you, too, and you've got to help me remember to ask you this.
[02:08:52.078 --> 02:09:12.735]  Well, actually you broke it down, man, in my view, almost perfectly, you know, because you described the natural process, you know, that the human brain is consisted on a physical level of electrical flows and of chemical flows, that those are in line with our spiritual nature and our psychological nature.
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:15.801]  That they change and alter as a result of our actions.
[02:09:15.841 --> 02:09:24.464]  If we're doing things that are meaningful and purposeful that have to do with connecting with people or defending people, as you said, then there's a positive flow that comes from that.
[02:09:24.924 --> 02:09:31.706]  If we get off course from there, we get hurt, we get disconnected, we betray ourselves, you know, we have a negative flow there.
[02:09:32.267 --> 02:09:35.328]  The drugs can create positive or negative flows as well.
[02:09:35.968 --> 02:09:42.110]  But the institution of these drugs aborts the natural process irregardless
[02:09:42.577 --> 02:09:43.118]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:09:56.627 --> 02:09:58.808]  To get high, or to feel good.
[02:09:58.828 --> 02:10:24.577]  Well that's why it takes a heroin addict, or a cocaine addict, more and more to get high, but the natural, you know when a football player, a linebacker, tackles the quarterback and gets a sack, or the running back jumps the pile up and makes the touchdown, you see them roar and shout up the sky, I mean they are being rewarded by their natural endorphins for what they see as good.
[02:10:25.857 --> 02:10:32.383]  The other one is when you look at your little baby boy or girl, you know, or when you see a beautiful sunset.
[02:10:32.423 --> 02:10:33.504]  It's just what you said.
[02:10:33.544 --> 02:10:34.805]  It's exactly right.
[02:10:35.325 --> 02:10:42.631]  And it's just, it's just a tragic corruption, you know, for the sake of corporate profit, you know.
[02:10:42.691 --> 02:10:46.935]  And people are told that they have these, this is what I was saying before we broke, you know.
[02:10:47.991 --> 02:11:02.358]  It's based on this philosophy that really is related to what happened in Nazi Germany and in our own country before that, this eugenics movement, this idea that we can make life more worthy of living by ridding ourselves of defective members of the species, defective genetics.
[02:11:02.778 --> 02:11:15.904]  It's the same kind of idea that children who are off course or adults who aren't happy with working at McDonald's or whatever, it's because they have some sort of biological or genetic defect, which we're going to correct with these drugs.
[02:11:16.337 --> 02:11:21.081]  It's total bogus science, but it's based in the same philosophy.
[02:11:21.121 --> 02:11:28.666]  If you don't go along with the state view of what you should be happy about, then there's something wrong with you.
[02:11:28.726 --> 02:11:31.008]  It's a genetic defect.
[02:11:31.268 --> 02:11:33.210]  Maybe there's something wrong with the society.
[02:11:33.250 --> 02:11:35.291]  Maybe there's something wrong with the community.
[02:11:35.351 --> 02:11:37.293]  Maybe there's something like that.
[02:11:38.013 --> 02:11:39.415]  This is really what it's about.
[02:11:39.575 --> 02:11:43.558]  People are lied to and told that mental illness is biologically based.
[02:11:43.578 --> 02:11:45.259]  Depression is a chemical imbalance.
[02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:47.141]  ADHD is a neurological disease.
[02:11:47.381 --> 02:11:50.343]  There's no scientific evidence for any of that.
[02:11:50.663 --> 02:11:51.344]  Here's an example.
[02:11:52.164 --> 02:11:55.546]  Elephants that they lock up in cages, shake their trunks back and forth.
[02:11:55.807 --> 02:11:57.167]  That's what an elephant does when they're depressed.
[02:11:57.227 --> 02:12:03.271]  Out in the wild when an elephant dies, a baby elephant, all the elephants stand around for two or three days and shake their heads and actually cry.
[02:12:03.331 --> 02:12:04.752]  I mean, that's normal.
[02:12:04.932 --> 02:12:06.613]  Well, now they just drug them in the zoos.
[02:12:07.554 --> 02:12:13.277]  That's it, and that's what we do to our children, and that's what we do to our people in the workplace.
[02:12:37.020 --> 02:12:38.941]  And that's exactly it.
[02:12:38.981 --> 02:12:43.101]  That's why my other book that you mentioned is called True Nature and Great Misunderstandings.
[02:12:43.161 --> 02:12:50.523]  If we don't act in accordance and understanding with the true nature of ourselves and people, then there's not going to be unhappiness.
[02:12:50.543 --> 02:12:52.004]  There's going to be dissatisfaction.
[02:12:52.404 --> 02:12:54.924]  And then psychiatry comes in to suppress that.
[02:12:55.724 --> 02:12:56.865]  Suppress that dissent.
[02:12:57.285 --> 02:12:58.225]  Here's another analogy.
[02:12:58.285 --> 02:12:58.745]  You got it.
[02:12:59.645 --> 02:13:01.666]  Doctor, I love these back and forth discussions.
[02:13:01.686 --> 02:13:02.626]  Thanks for putting up with me.
[02:13:03.126 --> 02:13:05.707]  Let's say you've got a car that runs off 93 octane.
[02:13:07.418 --> 02:13:09.559]  Okay, that's the average American.
[02:13:09.759 --> 02:13:13.881]  They come and they add a little bit of water to the gas tank.
[02:13:14.781 --> 02:13:23.825]  Okay, that's all the Coke machines and candy bar machines with the average child drinking two caffeinated drinks and eating two sugar candy bars and that's federal numbers.
[02:13:24.503 --> 02:13:26.426]  Okay, that's a little bit of water in the gas.
[02:13:26.546 --> 02:13:36.818]  And make a contract with the schools to make sure those products are placed in the schools, just like we're trying to make a contract to place the pharmaceutical products there.
[02:13:36.978 --> 02:13:42.926]  Exactly, so we give them a junk food that burns them out, that gets them all hyper, so they put a little bit of water in the car engine.
[02:13:43.442 --> 02:13:51.546]  Then when it sputters, instead of going, oh, you're not supposed to mix water with the gas, oh, we better put even worse stuff in the gas tank.
[02:13:51.566 --> 02:13:53.487]  Let's put some sugar in the gas tank.
[02:13:53.507 --> 02:13:57.789]  When that gets even worse, oh, we better add something else to the gas.
[02:13:58.490 --> 02:13:59.470]  I mean, do you see my analogy?
[02:14:00.130 --> 02:14:05.053]  Yeah, and add something, some kind of sludge into the motor so that you don't notice the sounds.
[02:14:05.535 --> 02:14:05.835]  I think so.
[02:14:23.694 --> 02:14:36.462]  You were talking about the need to be aggressive and focused and I've got an idea that I wanted to run by and see if it makes sense.
[02:14:36.662 --> 02:14:44.968]  I was thinking of one response to this mental health screening thing as part of our effort to stop this thing in Illinois.
[02:14:50.387 --> 02:14:59.335]  Large numbers of people who sign off on a statement that says, we refuse and we will refuse to have our children screened.
[02:15:00.656 --> 02:15:02.498]  It's kind of a civil resistance thing.
[02:15:02.818 --> 02:15:04.980]  We will not cooperate.
[02:15:05.380 --> 02:15:14.328]  And if we can get large numbers of people, you know, to stand forward and make that statement as a way of mobilizing energy, but also a way of making the statement.
[02:15:14.348 --> 02:15:17.431]  I think it's similar to the idea that one reason why I think that
[02:15:18.782 --> 02:15:29.348]  The politicians kind of holding back on the draft is because they know that if they institute a draft, there could be a hell of a lot of parents supporting a hell of a lot of young people who say, hell no, we won't go, you know.
[02:15:29.928 --> 02:15:31.810]  And it's just kind of my idea.
[02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:33.010]  Well, no, yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:15:33.050 --> 02:15:35.192]  Start a... You think that's a good... It's a great idea.
[02:15:35.232 --> 02:15:37.513]  Start a website with all the facts in one place.
[02:15:37.773 --> 02:15:38.734]  Your site would be a good place.
[02:15:39.074 --> 02:15:47.039]  Then have a form, you know, why you're against it, why you're not doing it, that people can print off and give to the school officials, threatening legal action
[02:15:47.459 --> 02:15:56.702]  I mean, there's a lot of legal problems with making your child preemptively undergo medical treatment that's fake medical treatment with guidelines written by drug companies.
[02:15:56.922 --> 02:15:57.863]  Okay, that's a good idea.
[02:15:57.883 --> 02:16:10.767]  Have a form and then also have like a petition or a resolution so we can collect as many names as possible who want to do that, but then also have a specific document that they can take to the schools to represent that.
[02:16:11.724 --> 02:16:12.425]  That's good.
[02:16:13.145 --> 02:16:16.969]  I'm going to create something like that and I want your listeners to know that.
[02:16:16.989 --> 02:16:18.570]  Tell folks about your website.
[02:16:19.111 --> 02:16:21.233]  It sounds like you'd be interested in helping me with that, maybe.
[02:16:21.513 --> 02:16:21.933]  I would.
[02:16:21.953 --> 02:16:25.076]  I'm fighting in a hundred directions, but this is a key area.
[02:16:25.096 --> 02:16:27.579]  I'll take responsibility for it, but I appreciate your support.
[02:16:27.619 --> 02:16:30.241]  No, no, this is a key area, Dr. Brink.
[02:16:31.202 --> 02:16:33.244]  This is one of their flagships of evil.
[02:16:33.763 --> 02:16:33.983]  Yeah.
[02:16:34.484 --> 02:16:39.727]  Yeah, it's a way for people to really say, hey, hell no, this is a place where I'll draw the line.
[02:16:39.767 --> 02:16:41.768]  You will not test my child in this way.
[02:16:43.129 --> 02:16:47.852]  Well, it's a fishing expedition for CPS to grab your children to begin with, especially with the pregnant mothers.
[02:16:48.653 --> 02:16:49.733]  Give folks your website.
[02:16:49.833 --> 02:16:50.234]  Right.
[02:16:50.874 --> 02:16:53.076]  It's wildestcolts.com.
[02:16:53.436 --> 02:16:57.859]  www.wildestcolts, like the wildest colts make the best horses.
[02:16:58.259 --> 02:16:59.740]  wildestcolts.com.
[02:17:00.911 --> 02:17:01.531]  We're about to break.
[02:17:01.551 --> 02:17:05.713]  We're going to come back, take calls, get into more news.
[02:17:05.974 --> 02:17:06.594]  Folks, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:06.694 --> 02:17:10.416]  I want you to understand, we're not exaggerating this.
[02:17:11.316 --> 02:17:16.039]  In fact, Dr. Breeding, do you find it's hard to articulate just how unbelievable this is?
[02:17:16.059 --> 02:17:18.660]  It's hard to articulate.
[02:17:18.820 --> 02:17:19.460]  Yes, I do.
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:30.186]  You know, but when you think about the history of psychiatry, you know, I mean, there was a time when this woman, Loretta Benda, was doing experiments where they gave large doses of LSD to
[02:17:31.084 --> 02:17:34.248]  School-aged children every day for months and years.
[02:17:34.268 --> 02:17:42.217]  You know, there was a time when the CIA mind-control experiences were giving hundreds of electroshocks to people to literally erase their memory.
[02:17:42.397 --> 02:17:42.978]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:43.018 --> 02:17:43.639]  We've got a break.
[02:17:43.699 --> 02:17:44.240]  We've got a break.
[02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:44.760]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.068 --> 02:17:53.975]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[02:17:54.295 --> 02:17:59.580]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:02.382]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[02:18:02.482 --> 02:18:07.587]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[02:18:08.107 --> 02:18:10.590]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:15.635]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government, and individuals for over 32 years.

[02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:40.051]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:18:40.071 --> 02:18:44.172]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:18:45.453 --> 02:18:46.013]  It still is!
[02:18:53.968 --> 02:18:57.469]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:18:57.789 --> 02:18:59.590]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:02.211]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:19:02.771 --> 02:19:04.792]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:19:05.172 --> 02:19:12.835]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:19:13.215 --> 02:19:16.956]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.
[02:19:17.657 --> 02:19:22.621]  Call this toll-free number for your free investing in precious metals kit.

[02:19:45.935 --> 02:19:48.377]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.157 --> 02:19:54.780]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:55.580]  Supreme Court.
[02:19:56.341 --> 02:20:00.643]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an I-Nothing decision of the U.S.
[02:20:00.683 --> 02:20:04.305]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[02:20:05.265 --> 02:20:10.488]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[02:20:11.323 --> 02:20:19.609]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:21.171 --> 02:20:22.932]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:29.031 --> 02:20:34.019]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:34.159 --> 02:20:35.842]  Call now.
[02:20:35.982 --> 02:20:42.533]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:20:45.567 --> 02:20:46.568]  It's finally here.
[02:20:46.688 --> 02:20:47.710]  Spring has arrived.
[02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:50.833]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:20:51.053 --> 02:20:54.517]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:20:54.738 --> 02:21:02.887]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:21:03.147 --> 02:21:03.968]  With Ark's heirloom
[02:21:04.188 --> 02:21:06.869]  You can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:21:07.069 --> 02:21:12.130]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:21:12.390 --> 02:21:16.892]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:21:17.072 --> 02:21:21.133]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:21:21.233 --> 02:21:28.355]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce, and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:21:28.655 --> 02:21:30.616]  We're about to go to Johnny Lee, John Pete, John and others.
[02:21:30.736 --> 02:21:31.957]  Dr. Breeding is our guest.
[02:21:57.977 --> 02:22:02.761]  He saw the Manchurian Candidate, I've seen it, and much of what's in that film is admitted congressional reports.
[02:22:02.781 --> 02:22:03.802]  I mean, that's how they do it.
[02:22:04.122 --> 02:22:08.506]  They admittedly did stuff very similar to this, and this is the crowd.
[02:22:08.526 --> 02:22:14.110]  We have a government, admittedly, that would just have a young volunteer go, we're going to test something for the common cold on you, it won't hurt you.
[02:22:14.431 --> 02:22:17.493]  Sign here, put them in a room, nerve gas them, they die on the spot.
[02:22:18.254 --> 02:22:20.796]  And it's just that, that's the folks in this government.
[02:22:21.334 --> 02:22:27.135]  Dr. Breeding, where do they find the psychiatrists and government doctors that for 50 years have been doing stuff like this?
[02:22:27.155 --> 02:22:41.559]  The psychiatrists seem to be pretty eager and readily available during the, really starting probably prior to World War, around World War I, definitely all the way through World War II and up to today.
[02:22:45.505 --> 02:22:48.746]  Some of them were witting and some of them were unwitting, from what I've researched.
[02:22:48.766 --> 02:22:53.869]  In other words, sometimes the funding came directly through the CIA and the government.
[02:22:53.889 --> 02:23:08.316]  A lot of times it went through the CIA to some sort of front group, which then funded the doctors, and they didn't necessarily know they were working for the government, even though they were working clearly on things like hypnosis and programming and stuff like that, because they were interested in that.
[02:23:10.077 --> 02:23:11.697]  What did you think of the Manchurian candidate?
[02:23:11.837 --> 02:23:12.658]  And then we've got to go to Coles.
[02:23:13.308 --> 02:23:15.028]  Well, I thought the movie was great.
[02:23:15.268 --> 02:23:17.149]  I thought it was really well done.
[02:23:17.209 --> 02:23:18.569]  Meryl Streep was great.
[02:23:19.730 --> 02:23:25.211]  I think it was one of those movies where the truth is scarier than the fiction.
[02:23:25.231 --> 02:23:34.633]  I did an interview yesterday and I had handed to me a lot of the documents about CIA mind control and the subtitle was Building the Manchurian Candidate.
[02:23:35.093 --> 02:23:39.234]  The things I just mentioned about the experiments with children, the experiments with adults,
[02:23:39.915 --> 02:23:48.722]  You know, those are all very clearly well documented facts, and if the government is willing to do those things, then it's not.
[02:23:49.463 --> 02:23:50.863]  It's very possible, you know.
[02:23:50.883 --> 02:24:03.246]  The levels of the technology are kind of questionable, but the basic willingness to take people and make them into subjects and to use them for their ends is clearly a consistent fact.
[02:24:03.346 --> 02:24:03.566]  It is.
[02:24:03.586 --> 02:24:04.787]  Let's take a call.
[02:24:04.927 --> 02:24:05.807]  Johnny in Texas.
[02:24:05.827 --> 02:24:06.447]  Thanks for holding.
[02:24:06.467 --> 02:24:06.907]  Go ahead.
[02:24:07.247 --> 02:24:07.887]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:24:08.007 --> 02:24:10.408]  This is breaking news from the Associated Press.
[02:24:10.588 --> 02:24:15.229]  President Bush offered up a new entry for his catalog on Bushisms, declaring that his administration
[02:24:15.709 --> 02:24:20.572]  We'll never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people.
[02:24:22.233 --> 02:24:23.033]  This 20 minutes ago.
[02:24:23.053 --> 02:24:33.480]  Yeah, that's quite a... that's quite a... And by the way, at a pro-life meeting last week, he described a fetus as feces nine times.
[02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:34.980]  It's just despicable.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.402]  We must protect our feces over and over again.
[02:24:38.724 --> 02:24:40.505]  I mean, this guy... You know what?
[02:24:40.585 --> 02:24:41.525]  I've got to get video of that.
[02:24:41.545 --> 02:24:42.425]  I know they're going to re-air it.
[02:24:42.445 --> 02:24:43.826]  Somebody's got to take that for me.
[02:24:44.226 --> 02:24:46.927]  Now, tell me the author, where he said it.
[02:24:47.367 --> 02:24:51.588]  Okay, this is... There is no author on this.
[02:24:51.688 --> 02:24:53.149]  It just says Associated Press.
[02:24:53.849 --> 02:24:56.030]  And the article is at mastersofterror.net.
[02:24:56.050 --> 02:24:58.190]  You can click there and read the article.
[02:24:58.510 --> 02:25:01.931]  He goes on to say, our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.
[02:25:02.291 --> 02:25:05.292]  They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people.
[02:25:05.693 --> 02:25:06.773]  And neither do we.
[02:25:08.021 --> 02:25:09.021]  There you go, America.
[02:25:09.142 --> 02:25:10.862]  Well, did you hear Kerry slip up?
[02:25:10.922 --> 02:25:14.364]  And by the way, take it out of the transcript and don't show it on TV.
[02:25:15.504 --> 02:25:20.527]  He said, we're going to double our forces to carry out terrorist operations.
[02:25:21.487 --> 02:25:23.068]  It's on AP, Alex.
[02:25:23.108 --> 02:25:24.308]  I'll let you go and get your other calls.
[02:25:24.328 --> 02:25:29.291]  Yeah, do me a favor, email that to tips at infowars.com or to Paul Watson.
[02:25:29.631 --> 02:25:30.391]  Okay, I'll do both.
[02:25:30.691 --> 02:25:32.792]  Now go to presentplanet.com and email it to him.
[02:25:32.832 --> 02:25:33.533]  This is good.
[02:25:33.873 --> 02:25:34.453]  Dr. Breeding,
[02:25:36.723 --> 02:25:41.386]  They say, in credible sources, Capitol Hill Blue was never anything but accurate about Clinton.
[02:25:41.726 --> 02:25:48.150]  They say Bush is throwing fits, having psychotic fits, on a bunch of drugs, and then you watch him, and it looks like he's on drugs.
[02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:56.134]  Well, you know, I read that, and I'm waiting to verify it.
[02:25:56.194 --> 02:25:56.695]  I don't know.
[02:25:56.715 --> 02:25:57.355]  I don't know.
[02:25:57.435 --> 02:26:01.618]  You certainly don't have to resort to psych drugs to explain Bush, but at the same time,
[02:26:02.958 --> 02:26:10.341]  I did have the sense since the last two or three times I heard him talk that he sure sounded like he was on drugs, but who knows?
[02:26:10.601 --> 02:26:14.423]  He's definitely wedded, and his family are definitely wedded, to Eli Lilly.
[02:26:14.703 --> 02:26:17.945]  Their main guy, of course, is on the Homeland Security Committee.
[02:26:17.965 --> 02:26:21.786]  Well, Bush's doctor who just had to step down as an admitted prescription drug addict.
[02:26:23.167 --> 02:26:24.287]  His private doctor.
[02:26:24.708 --> 02:26:27.629]  He's definitely a defender and a promoter of
[02:26:28.362 --> 02:26:30.163]  Did you hear about that though, this new Bushism?
[02:26:50.090 --> 02:26:55.892]  America, as if you're talking about the terrorists, reveals the truth that you are messing with America.
[02:26:58.734 --> 02:27:00.234]  He's definitely a dangerous man.
[02:27:01.575 --> 02:27:04.316]  But, I mean, it's every time he talks he does this.
[02:27:06.417 --> 02:27:17.566]  That's why they worked so hard to protect him from really being confronted and why it's so important that they basically... You know, I had the article yesterday... ...so that he didn't get put on the spot very often.
[02:27:17.926 --> 02:27:21.789]  I had the AP article yesterday and everyone got to it at a big pro-life meeting in Florida.
[02:27:22.130 --> 02:27:25.072]  He called a fetus, feces, nine times.
[02:27:25.953 --> 02:27:26.693]  That's amazing.
[02:27:27.154 --> 02:27:32.398]  I mean, folks, this guy shouldn't be able to be a bus station attendant.
[02:27:32.458 --> 02:27:33.739]  I mean, this guy is incredible.
[02:27:36.019 --> 02:27:39.041]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.922 --> 02:27:42.704]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.387 --> 02:27:50.771]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[02:27:50.911 --> 02:27:57.956]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[02:27:58.257 --> 02:28:05.162]  Membership in the bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[02:28:05.442 --> 02:28:12.973]  The Silver Bear Cafe provides you with an income opportunity that will provide you and your family with an ongoing revenue stream in return for simply spreading the message.
[02:28:13.353 --> 02:28:19.302]  So many of you have been trying to get the message out individually, but collectively our voices are strong and cannot be silenced.
[02:28:19.742 --> 02:28:22.386]  Membership in the bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom.
[02:28:22.546 --> 02:28:24.888]  How the runaway government is crushing the American dream.
[02:28:25.189 --> 02:28:26.970]  Why wars are played out across the globe.
[02:28:27.150 --> 02:28:29.072]  The fractional reserve system, etc.
[02:28:29.292 --> 02:28:31.955]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourselves.
[02:28:32.275 --> 02:28:33.376]  Knowledge is power.
[02:28:33.616 --> 02:28:38.541]  Feed your mind and feed your financial independence with a visit to SilverBearCafe.com.
[02:28:38.681 --> 02:28:40.743]  That's SilverBearCafe.com.
[02:28:40.883 --> 02:28:44.066]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[02:28:46.304 --> 02:28:49.285]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:49.305 --> 02:28:58.468]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:58.788 --> 02:29:03.449]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:03.929 --> 02:29:10.654]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:11.055 --> 02:29:22.844]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.324 --> 02:29:27.770]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:29:45.453 --> 02:29:47.795]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:29:48.055 --> 02:29:51.899]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:29:52.219 --> 02:29:53.040]  Read the labels.
[02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:57.584]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:29:57.824 --> 02:30:02.007]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:30:02.388 --> 02:30:07.252]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:30:07.632 --> 02:30:11.214]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:30:11.415 --> 02:30:16.738]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:30:17.018 --> 02:30:19.760]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:20.941]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:31:19.995 --> 02:31:20.955]  Hello, Alex.
[02:31:21.015 --> 02:31:21.935]  Hello, Doctor.
[02:31:47.333 --> 02:31:55.635]  What we need to do is take the Southern Baptist Convention's advice and have a mass exodus out of the government school system.
[02:31:57.275 --> 02:32:04.497]  I'd like to know, Doctor, is Mrs. Harriman's Cold Springs Lab still operating?
[02:32:04.517 --> 02:32:08.517]  I know that a lot of the
[02:32:11.186 --> 02:32:11.886]  I think so, yes.
[02:32:40.018 --> 02:32:40.359]  I think so.
[02:33:02.260 --> 02:33:06.922]  The CIA admittedly introduced LSD into the population.
[02:33:07.523 --> 02:33:13.066]  Then, if it's something they don't have a patent on, they then make it illegal to put people in their private prisons.
[02:33:13.126 --> 02:33:19.029]  Then they bring out an almost identical psych drug that they have a patent on and simultaneously push that.
[02:33:19.369 --> 02:33:22.371]  And Eli Lilly, of course, produced, supplied the
[02:33:24.509 --> 02:33:32.073]  LSD for Eli Lilly, and now they supply the Prozac and the Zyprexa and the Stratera for kids and things like that.
[02:33:32.593 --> 02:33:35.835]  And they continue to be in the highest edge lines of the government.
[02:33:35.875 --> 02:33:39.937]  And I would look, as the patents run on this, for illegal versions of this to appear.
[02:33:39.977 --> 02:33:43.579]  They'll then ban it, and then move to the next new patent to drug it.
[02:33:43.999 --> 02:33:48.721]  And then, of course, the globalists will also supply the illegal drug, and then when you use it, they'll put you in their private prison.
[02:33:48.741 --> 02:33:52.663]  But the exodus from government schools is a good idea, and it is happening, obviously.
[02:33:52.683 --> 02:33:54.064]  There's a hell of a lot of homeschoolers.
[02:33:54.404 --> 02:34:13.811]  The other thing, like I said, that I'm interested in mobilizing is even those who are in or not in the schools, at least specifically in response to this so-called mental health initiative, to just say, we will not comply and just throw up the specter of, you know, how are you going to implement this when you've got
[02:34:14.474 --> 02:34:22.618]  You know, thousands, hundreds of thousands, hopefully millions of people who are civil resistors who just will not do it.
[02:34:22.638 --> 02:34:24.259]  Okay, we've got to go to calls quick here.
[02:34:24.359 --> 02:34:25.199]  Lee, anything else?
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:31.482]  The restructuring of children's personality in the MKUltra project.
[02:34:32.023 --> 02:34:37.025]  Have you read John DeCamp's book, The Franklin Cover-Up?
[02:34:37.637 --> 02:34:38.298]  I have not read it.
[02:34:38.698 --> 02:34:39.058]  I've read it.
[02:34:39.078 --> 02:34:40.319]  We've had to read it several times.
[02:34:40.959 --> 02:34:41.420]  Oh, I guess.
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:42.160]  Well, thank you.
[02:34:42.180 --> 02:34:42.520]  That's all.
[02:34:42.881 --> 02:34:43.681]  Thanks for the call.
[02:34:44.582 --> 02:34:45.622]  John, Louisiana.
[02:34:45.642 --> 02:34:46.383]  John, go ahead.
[02:34:47.244 --> 02:34:49.145]  Good afternoon, Alex and Doc.
[02:34:49.345 --> 02:34:53.648]  Look, the notion that medical doctors are prescribing this for these school children
[02:34:54.148 --> 02:34:57.769]  Uh, with a 10 or 15 minute office visit is absolutely absurd.
[02:34:58.269 --> 02:35:03.171]  What they are in reality, they're simply proxies for the school teachers and the school nurses.
[02:35:03.491 --> 02:35:08.672]  Yeah, I mean it's like you're the Coca-Cola representative coming around trying to, you know, sell Coke.
[02:35:08.692 --> 02:35:16.494]  They're really proxies for Eli Lilly and Novartis and companies like that.
[02:35:16.554 --> 02:35:18.855]  Yeah, it's like the Budweiser truck pulling up at the 7-Eleven.
[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:23.742]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:35:23.842 --> 02:35:25.523]  School teachers are not qualified for that.
[02:35:25.563 --> 02:35:27.684]  They don't understand the minds of children.
[02:35:28.284 --> 02:35:34.708]  They've been indoctrinated with behaviorist crap from John Broadus Watson and B.F.
[02:35:34.748 --> 02:35:37.330]  Skinner, and that's the only thing they know.
[02:35:37.430 --> 02:35:39.851]  They don't really understand the minds of children.
[02:35:39.871 --> 02:35:40.632]  Now, wait a minute.
[02:35:40.692 --> 02:35:42.893]  Wait a minute, John.
[02:35:42.973 --> 02:35:49.657]  John, my anthropology tells me that Prozac and Ritalin bushes grew in all seven continents, the six that are inhabited,
[02:35:50.697 --> 02:35:54.540]  And that humans have always taken Prozac and without it we die.
[02:35:54.560 --> 02:36:00.784]  That proves the power of the pharmaceutical industry and the organized medicine industry.
[02:36:00.804 --> 02:36:01.825]  That's what it proves to me.
[02:36:02.885 --> 02:36:10.270]  Yeah, but just watch out about who's qualified because see the most qualified people, at least according to the credentialing process, are the most dangerous.
[02:36:11.778 --> 02:36:15.521]  Because the qualifications are bogus and the science is bogus.
[02:36:15.541 --> 02:36:19.343]  Yeah, their million dollar house... There's no real disease or illness.
[02:36:19.524 --> 02:36:22.606]  So how can it be qualified to find something that doesn't exist?
[02:36:22.646 --> 02:36:26.569]  Yeah, their million dollar house in Jaguar is paid for by all of this.
[02:36:26.629 --> 02:36:27.249]  They're demons.
[02:36:27.309 --> 02:36:27.850]  Thanks, John.
[02:36:27.930 --> 02:36:29.251]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:36:29.291 --> 02:36:33.033]  In the state of Louisiana, they've given up the pretense of medical doctor prescriptions.
[02:36:33.354 --> 02:36:34.594]  Now a psychologist.
[02:36:34.654 --> 02:36:38.057]  Now, all school teachers take some silly courses in psychology.
[02:36:38.437 --> 02:36:45.847]  And in effect they're prescribing your drugs as they have in the past, but certainly there's no medical doctors involved in this anymore in this state.
[02:36:46.628 --> 02:36:47.349]  I hear you.
[02:36:47.389 --> 02:36:51.815]  I was very, I was very, I protested very loudly about that thing and it went through.
[02:36:51.875 --> 02:36:55.420]  I guarantee it's not going to happen in Texas, but I can also tell you that
[02:36:55.959 --> 02:36:59.962]  The doctors, again, it's not the issue that psychologists aren't qualified.
[02:37:00.263 --> 02:37:04.887]  It's the issue that nobody should be doing because it's bogus science and it's hurting our children very badly.
[02:37:04.907 --> 02:37:05.387]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:37:05.407 --> 02:37:06.148]  Let me stop you.
[02:37:06.448 --> 02:37:09.911]  Doctor, I mean, every year, what is it, 10, 15 new mental illnesses?
[02:37:11.152 --> 02:37:13.814]  Yeah, yeah, every year it's like there's hundreds of them.
[02:37:13.834 --> 02:37:16.256]  You know, oppositional defiant disorder.
[02:37:16.557 --> 02:37:17.477]  I won't back down.
[02:37:17.537 --> 02:37:19.339]  That means you have a disease, Alex.
[02:37:19.719 --> 02:37:21.501]  You know, conduct disorder.
[02:37:21.983 --> 02:37:29.927]  Bipolar disorder, mathematics dyslexia disorder, anti-sexual perversion disorder, you know what I mean?
[02:37:29.947 --> 02:37:31.708]  It's like, yeah, there's hundreds of them.
[02:37:32.088 --> 02:37:36.070]  And they're all made up in committee rooms of the American Psychiatric Association.
[02:37:36.090 --> 02:37:36.871]  Okay, thanks for the call, John.
[02:37:36.931 --> 02:37:37.411]  I'll let you go.
[02:37:37.611 --> 02:37:38.872]  Pete in California, go ahead.
[02:37:38.892 --> 02:37:47.036]  Yeah, it seems like an interesting side benefit to this move towards making everybody a mental patient.
[02:37:47.552 --> 02:37:54.735]  Would be the fact that if you are diagnosed with any mental disorder or taking any kind of prescription drugs for those things, you cannot own a firearm.
[02:37:56.336 --> 02:38:01.458]  And theoretically, you know, they'll keep you out of the military and various other things.
[02:38:01.618 --> 02:38:07.480]  Is that there's more and more connections now between the mental health service agencies and Homeland Security.
[02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:10.702]  And so, and through the health and human services.
[02:38:10.742 --> 02:38:14.243]  So basically your records, it's another tracking system, your records,
[02:38:14.611 --> 02:38:18.074]  Are they turned over to Health and Human Services, Homeland Security?
[02:38:18.094 --> 02:38:18.674]  That's another thing.
[02:38:18.694 --> 02:38:21.156]  Millions of veterans... So it's all tied together.
[02:38:21.396 --> 02:38:29.922]  Millions of veterans since Korea are, if they complain or do whatever, are given a mental illness designation and now they're finding out they can't own firearms.
[02:38:30.022 --> 02:38:38.268]  Grandpas with no criminal record who own million-dollar companies try to go buy their 15-year-old grandson a .22 rifle and go, sorry, you're in a mental illness catalog.
[02:38:38.548 --> 02:38:39.449]  Thanks for the call, Pete.
[02:38:39.489 --> 02:38:39.969]  Good point.
[02:38:40.369 --> 02:38:41.871]  John in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:38:41.911 --> 02:38:42.291]  Go ahead.
[02:38:42.711 --> 02:38:49.655]  Hello, I renewed my ISP and website hosting with Infowars.net today, and I want to thank your partner.
[02:38:49.695 --> 02:38:58.460]  He said I didn't have to worry about censorship anymore, unlike my former ISP email and web hosting at AT&T, Scripps, Comcast.
[02:38:59.641 --> 02:39:09.086]  For your guest, SSRIs keep serotonin from being metabolized, and serotonin is a vasoconstrictor that raises blood pressure.
[02:39:09.793 --> 02:39:13.555]  So antidepressants have a side effect of causing heart attacks and strokes?
[02:39:15.076 --> 02:39:16.857]  Yeah, they have a lot of side effects.
[02:39:16.917 --> 02:39:18.659]  They cause heart attacks and strokes.
[02:39:18.699 --> 02:39:23.542]  They can lead to diabetes type problems, all kinds of heart complications.
[02:39:24.022 --> 02:39:26.784]  They also will permanently alter brain function over time.
[02:39:27.104 --> 02:39:31.206]  They often exacerbate suicidal and or homicidal tendencies.
[02:39:31.867 --> 02:39:33.808]  Oh man, and their health to withdraw from.
[02:39:34.349 --> 02:39:40.685]  Well, Bush Senior, when he was president during the rancontra, all those trials and all that pressure, he was prescribed the tranquilizer.
[02:39:41.195 --> 02:39:41.915]  Halcyon.
[02:39:41.975 --> 02:39:42.595]  Halcyon.
[02:39:42.675 --> 02:39:45.116]  James Baker called it Bush's Blue Bomb.
[02:39:45.356 --> 02:39:46.316]  By the way, let me stop you.
[02:39:46.776 --> 02:39:48.516]  My father's an oral surgeon and dentist.
[02:39:48.997 --> 02:39:55.338]  When they do sedation dentistry, you take one of these things, you don't remember anything from people I've talked to.
[02:39:55.358 --> 02:40:00.939]  I mean, they could be ripping your wisdom teeth out, and you don't even remember it, and you're smiling.
[02:40:01.139 --> 02:40:07.100]  And I remember reading that, Bush taking Halcyon, which is classified as an amnesiac, by the way.
[02:40:07.500 --> 02:40:10.961]  Yeah, so anything that's said to him in that state is recorded
[02:40:11.457 --> 02:40:11.817]  I don't know.
[02:40:37.208 --> 02:40:41.091]  Imagine all these people on drugs, they're getting all this propaganda into their minds.
[02:40:41.111 --> 02:40:43.333]  They're not really able to process it analytically.
[02:40:43.353 --> 02:40:47.477]  It definitely has that function.
[02:40:48.178 --> 02:40:51.080]  For a year, in college, I was a dental assistant with my dad.
[02:40:51.260 --> 02:40:54.183]  And I mean, it's a good drug for pulling somebody's wisdom teeth out.
[02:40:54.203 --> 02:40:56.365]  You give them the drug, that way you don't have to knock them out.
[02:40:56.785 --> 02:40:57.786]  And they're afraid.
[02:40:58.306 --> 02:41:02.210]  But once they take that pill, man, they do not care.
[02:41:02.270 --> 02:41:03.591]  They're on cloud ten.
[02:41:04.438 --> 02:41:07.040]  Thanks for the call, and George Bush gobbling those.
[02:41:08.401 --> 02:41:10.042]  Stan, who's up next here?
[02:41:11.443 --> 02:41:13.164]  Stan, where are you calling us from, sir?
[02:41:13.725 --> 02:41:14.245]  Indiana.
[02:41:14.505 --> 02:41:15.246]  Welcome, go ahead.
[02:41:15.806 --> 02:41:17.908]  Thank you, and good to talk to you.
[02:41:18.268 --> 02:41:26.534]  This is, from my point of view now, I see this as just another method of the corporation's control of everybody that's got a college degree.
[02:41:27.114 --> 02:41:32.618]  They purposefully leave out certain parts of it, creating careers out of a measure of ignorance,
[02:41:33.331 --> 02:41:34.732]  Or just blatant stupidity.
[02:41:35.712 --> 02:41:36.613]  And this is perpetual.
[02:41:36.633 --> 02:41:41.736]  It's like they've Rube Goldberg'd our whole society for the profit margins to be increased by the corporation.
[02:41:41.756 --> 02:41:44.998]  Okay, for those who don't understand what you're saying, it's very well said.
[02:41:46.339 --> 02:41:58.186]  Now the new big majors, all the colleges offering Homeland Security majors, now that will supply the workforce that will go out and lobby for the job and who will believe in the system.
[02:41:58.406 --> 02:41:59.127]  Comments, Doctor?
[02:42:04.282 --> 02:42:09.800]  It's one thing to know what your purpose and passion is in life and create that reality.
[02:42:10.157 --> 02:42:22.142]  It's another thing to have lost hope with that, to have been conditioned to think that all the best you can do is plug into something that's offered to you by the state or by the corporation, and you're a lost soul.
[02:42:22.582 --> 02:42:25.603]  Doctor, we're going to have to go to hold here because I've got to air this.
[02:42:26.024 --> 02:42:27.144]  Take a five minute break if you want.
[02:42:27.384 --> 02:42:30.385]  I'm going to air this from Hannity and Combs.
[02:42:31.026 --> 02:42:32.386]  We're analyzing this, folks.
[02:42:33.066 --> 02:42:35.988]  This is Tommy Franks dropping bombshell after bombshell.
[02:42:36.568 --> 02:42:37.588]  Listen to this carefully.
[02:42:37.608 --> 02:42:39.109]  We'll go ahead and play that clip, Stephanie.
[02:42:39.529 --> 02:42:46.938]  I have a chance to sit down for a Cable News exclusive with the former commander of CENTCOM and the author of the brand new book, American Soldier.
[02:42:47.279 --> 02:42:48.921]  I talk with General Tommy Franks.
[02:42:51.079 --> 02:42:58.102]  Four days prior to 9-11, 7th of September, 7th of September, you spoke to the CENTCOM intelligence staff.
[02:42:58.202 --> 02:42:58.462]  Correct.
[02:42:58.843 --> 02:42:59.903]  You were asked a question.
[02:43:00.183 --> 02:43:00.623]  Absolutely.
[02:43:00.643 --> 02:43:03.505]  The question is, General, what keeps you up at night?
[02:43:03.745 --> 02:43:03.965]  Right.
[02:43:04.645 --> 02:43:10.488]  And I said, one World Trade Center tower falling into another, a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.
[02:43:11.524 --> 02:43:17.007]  I worried for a long, long time about terrorist attacks on the United States of America.
[02:43:17.327 --> 02:43:26.172]  I think a lot of thoughtful Americans had been put on notice beginning in the early 1980s when our Marines were killed in Beirut in the Marine bombing.
[02:43:26.892 --> 02:43:34.356]  And then up through 1993 when we saw the attack on the World Trade Center, not far from where we're sitting right now.
[02:43:34.956 --> 02:43:36.117]  It always worried me.
[02:43:37.454 --> 02:43:45.249]  That there could be an attack on American soil that could be so horrendous that the people, that America...
[02:43:46.161 --> 02:43:53.145]  Would demand the use of our military to protect them inside the United States of America.
[02:43:53.585 --> 02:44:09.933]  And I thought about a couple of movies that I'd seen, and I think one of them was centered here in New York, where there'd been martial law, and we had tanks and armored personnel carriers and soldiers on every corner, rather than what we see today, which is well-armed policemen out there doing their job.
[02:44:10.513 --> 02:44:19.336]  And so I looked at it on the 7th of September and I told her a big terrorist attack like on the World Trade Center is what keeps me awake at night.
[02:44:19.596 --> 02:44:20.736]  Four days before the attack?
[02:44:20.756 --> 02:44:23.217]  Four days before the attack.
[02:44:23.237 --> 02:44:31.100]  But it actually had less to do with the business of the World Trade Center than that and more to do with the prospect
[02:44:31.898 --> 02:44:37.981]  Of something happening that is so horrendous that our military might wind up being used in a martial law situation.
[02:44:38.001 --> 02:44:39.701]  Praise God it didn't happen, and I'm glad.
[02:44:39.961 --> 02:44:41.922]  You were overseas when 9-11 happened.
[02:44:41.942 --> 02:44:43.243]  You were on your way to Pakistan.
[02:44:43.263 --> 02:44:43.663]  Right.
[02:44:43.703 --> 02:44:45.924]  You write in the book, you knew right away it was Bin Laden.
[02:44:46.044 --> 02:44:46.204]  Right.
[02:44:46.224 --> 02:44:48.025]  You knew right away we were going to war.
[02:44:48.185 --> 02:44:48.365]  Right.
[02:44:48.825 --> 02:44:54.187]  And you knew it was connected to General Massad of the Northern Alliance that had been assassinated, what, just a weekend prior.
[02:44:54.347 --> 02:44:54.527]  Right.
[02:44:55.068 --> 02:44:58.449]  All of it sort of came to me very clearly.
[02:44:58.989 --> 02:45:01.813]  In a period of less than a minute, someone rapped on the door.
[02:45:01.873 --> 02:45:05.678]  We were in creeps getting gas in the airplane and said, turn on the television.
[02:45:05.718 --> 02:45:10.665]  I turned it on and I, along with you, watched the second jet hit the second tower of the World Trade Center.
[02:45:11.465 --> 02:45:19.835]  And my first thoughts were Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, Afghanistan, and the tie to Massoud, who had been the leader of the Northern Allies.
[02:45:20.195 --> 02:45:30.447]  You say of Bin Laden, you say the following quote, he's no coward, you say he's a deadly adversary, a worthy, bold commander of a dedicated and capable force.
[02:45:32.801 --> 02:45:34.983]  Yeah, I absolutely feel that way.
[02:45:35.063 --> 02:45:38.125]  I think one should never underestimate the enemy.
[02:45:38.646 --> 02:45:50.375]  It is so convenient to talk about Adolf Hitler being crazy, to talk about Mussolini being a madman, and the list of examples goes on and on.
[02:45:51.178 --> 02:45:54.180]  Osama Bin Laden is to be hated, to be sure.
[02:45:55.201 --> 02:45:58.263]  But he is not hated because he is a coward.
[02:45:58.723 --> 02:46:14.974]  He is a well-organized ideologue who hates the United States of America, hates our freedoms, hates our liberties, hates the wealth that the people in our country have, hates the fact that we're blessed with natural resources.
[02:46:15.534 --> 02:46:17.055]  He is a worthy adversary.
[02:46:17.316 --> 02:46:20.898]  And at the end of the day, he has to either be killed or captured.
[02:46:21.418 --> 02:46:22.879]  Do you believe he's alive?
[02:46:23.059 --> 02:46:23.319]  I do.
[02:46:23.559 --> 02:46:25.680]  How close do you think you came to getting him?
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:26.881]  That's a tough question.
[02:46:26.901 --> 02:46:32.323]  People ask me that all the time because of the speculation of, well, we missed him in Tora Bora and this and that.
[02:46:32.924 --> 02:46:40.167]  I'm not at all convinced that there has been a single point in time where we have had a close miss on Osama Bin Laden.
[02:46:41.127 --> 02:46:44.649]  I believe he is still in the area, and I don't know where.
[02:46:44.709 --> 02:46:56.174]  I think the conspiratorialists who believe, well, he'll pop up here during the election run-up, I just don't believe that at all, because I think there are too many in American government just like me.
[02:46:56.634 --> 02:46:58.195]  If I knew where he was, he'd be dead.
[02:46:58.415 --> 02:46:59.435]  Yeah.
[02:46:59.635 --> 02:47:00.656]  You do believe, though?
[02:47:00.676 --> 02:47:02.497]  You are confident we are going to find him?
[02:47:02.517 --> 02:47:02.837]  I am.
[02:47:02.857 --> 02:47:05.398]  He will be captured as Saddam Hussein was captured?
[02:47:06.159 --> 02:47:10.302]  Wesson Churchill during the war years said something that rings true today.
[02:47:10.382 --> 02:47:13.005]  He said, never give in.
[02:47:13.645 --> 02:47:16.668]  Never, never, never, never give in to terrorism.
[02:47:17.048 --> 02:47:24.995]  Well, despite all of what we see on our television sets and what we read in our media, Sean, America is not a quitter.
[02:47:25.015 --> 02:47:25.816]  We have 225 years of not quitting.
[02:47:28.358 --> 02:47:34.021]  Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda threaten our way of life, and eventually we'll get him.
[02:47:34.322 --> 02:47:35.542]  You threaten our way of life!
[02:47:35.582 --> 02:47:42.967]  As we get further and further away from 9-11, do you think they have a tendency to forget what it is we're doing and why we're doing it?
[02:47:43.927 --> 02:47:44.427]  I do think.
[02:47:44.708 --> 02:47:49.470]  I think it's not like they forget.
[02:47:49.550 --> 02:47:50.571]  I think we all
[02:47:51.428 --> 02:47:52.149]  I don't
[02:48:08.048 --> 02:48:12.629]  I went by yesterday and saw policemen standing out there with automatic weapons.
[02:48:12.729 --> 02:48:13.449]  And troops.
[02:48:13.589 --> 02:48:16.510]  On the one hand, I was very thankful for the fact that they were there.
[02:48:17.050 --> 02:48:22.452]  On the other hand, I sort of shuddered a bit realizing that the threat is still very much with us.
[02:48:22.532 --> 02:48:26.813]  But we do have a tendency, when we get further away... Okay, that's it right there.
[02:48:27.773 --> 02:48:29.353]  Folks, I've got a few comments on that.
[02:48:29.373 --> 02:48:31.154]  Some comments from Dr. Breeding when we get back.
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:33.682]  I mean, the psychology there.
[02:48:34.042 --> 02:48:36.884]  Well, they'll want this because it'll make them safe, but I don't really like that.
[02:48:37.245 --> 02:48:40.167]  See, it equals safety.
[02:48:40.447 --> 02:48:41.568]  See how you're being sold on that?
[02:48:45.832 --> 02:48:50.176]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.336 --> 02:48:54.720]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:57.733 --> 02:48:59.274]  A new world order.
[02:48:59.294 --> 02:48:59.515]  Pan America.
[02:48:59.535 --> 02:49:00.695]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:27.193 --> 02:49:32.215]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new 2.5 hour video, Police Take 3, is for you!

[02:49:45.180 --> 02:49:51.424]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:49:51.564 --> 02:49:57.728]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has 8 LED lamps.
[02:49:58.008 --> 02:50:06.433]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:06.693 --> 02:50:13.697]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:50:13.997 --> 02:50:18.840]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:50:19.061 --> 02:50:24.424]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:50:24.804 --> 02:50:27.886]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[02:51:49.324 --> 02:51:50.605]  Tommy Franks.
[02:51:50.685 --> 02:51:54.426]  And again, tomorrow, I'll probably hear that again and analyze it slower for 30 minutes.
[02:51:55.487 --> 02:51:57.768]  Again, oh, my big fear is there'll be an attack.
[02:51:57.788 --> 02:52:00.349]  The people will really want martial law to keep them safe.
[02:52:01.090 --> 02:52:02.550]  Again, martial law equals safety.
[02:52:02.570 --> 02:52:05.371]  And oh, I'm glad there's heavily armed police, not troops.
[02:52:05.391 --> 02:52:06.392]  There's troops everywhere.
[02:52:07.452 --> 02:52:09.393]  They, so this is, they're introducing this.
[02:52:09.453 --> 02:52:11.274]  Now the term even martial law.
[02:52:11.915 --> 02:52:12.575]  Said it twice.
[02:52:12.635 --> 02:52:12.755]  Now,
[02:52:13.690 --> 02:52:24.538]  Briefly, Tom Andrew, with the Genesis Network up there, he's got the Reuters article about Bush's latest Freudian slip, and read us the headline and where Bush said this, and I'm begging folks to tape this or find this.
[02:52:24.818 --> 02:52:25.639]  I gotta have this.
[02:52:25.979 --> 02:52:28.381]  I'm sure we'll have it tomorrow, audio-wise, but I need that video.
[02:52:28.661 --> 02:52:29.982]  Tom, read us the article, please.
[02:52:30.002 --> 02:52:39.629]  It says right from the top, President Bush told a roomful of top Pentagon brass on Thursday that his administration would never stop looking for ways to harm the United States.
[02:52:41.115 --> 02:52:43.275]  That's the headline, and was this televised?
[02:52:43.796 --> 02:52:47.396]  I'm looking for it.
[02:52:47.596 --> 02:52:48.477]  Read more of the article.
[02:52:48.697 --> 02:52:51.117]  I'm sure this had to be televised if this went out over television.
[02:52:51.277 --> 02:53:02.020]  It says the latest installment of misspeak from a president long known for his malapropisms came during a signing ceremony for a new $417 billion defense appropriations bill.
[02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:05.780]  And where was he at this Pentagon press announcement?
[02:53:07.481 --> 02:53:08.321]  He was at the Pentagon.
[02:53:08.872 --> 02:53:10.033]  But I don't know exactly where.
[02:53:10.093 --> 02:53:11.154]  I don't know if it was television.
[02:53:11.194 --> 02:53:12.776]  So yeah, he's in one of the big conference rooms.
[02:53:12.796 --> 02:53:14.297]  Yeah, that's got to be on C-SPAN.
[02:53:14.637 --> 02:53:16.879]  They'll probably edit that tonight, though.
[02:53:16.999 --> 02:53:18.521]  Tom, that's from Reuters.
[02:53:18.981 --> 02:53:20.502]  Reuters, and it's also on CNN.
[02:53:21.523 --> 02:53:22.764]  Just happened a half an hour ago.
[02:53:23.005 --> 02:53:24.466]  Oh my gosh, thank you so much.
[02:53:25.607 --> 02:53:27.428]  Dr. Breeding, thanks for holding through all of that.
[02:53:27.709 --> 02:53:29.170]  Any comments on the Tommy Franks?
[02:53:35.158 --> 02:53:43.205]  Part of being conditioned is that you literally are not able to see that which is inconsistent with the beliefs that you've been conditioned into.
[02:53:44.166 --> 02:53:51.272]  Another part is that if you've done horrific things, to confront that is very, very difficult.
[02:53:51.292 --> 02:53:56.177]  There's no way a man like that is going to see himself as anything other than an ethical patriot.
[02:53:59.425 --> 02:54:13.313]  To see himself as a war criminal or at best an unwitting leader of destruction on behalf of a corporate American government, you know, would just be, it would destroy him.
[02:54:13.333 --> 02:54:18.596]  You know, so everything he has to do is to defend and justify and protect his glee.
[02:54:18.636 --> 02:54:26.240]  You know, you ask him, you know, do you have any feelings about whether there were weapons of mass destruction there and the fact that you were maybe misled on that?
[02:54:27.501 --> 02:54:30.643]  No, I'm glad they weren't there, because that would have made our job a lot harder.
[02:54:31.143 --> 02:54:33.504]  And Hussein was evil, and it's good we took him down.
[02:54:33.524 --> 02:54:35.205]  And if he could have had him, he would have.
[02:54:35.265 --> 02:54:37.906]  But again, he's talking about Bin Laden and Saddam.
[02:54:38.187 --> 02:54:40.128]  Both of these are globalist creations.
[02:54:40.928 --> 02:54:41.868]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:54:41.989 --> 02:54:44.630]  You brought up that fact as that was going through.
[02:54:44.730 --> 02:54:47.131]  And there's no responsibility for that.
[02:54:47.191 --> 02:54:48.592]  You know, there's just looking at
[02:54:49.255 --> 02:54:57.179]  His duty to defend the American way is 250 years of goodness.
[02:54:57.219 --> 02:54:57.719]  You heard him.
[02:54:58.239 --> 02:55:02.201]  There's no reality on that in terms of the history of the United States.
[02:55:02.261 --> 02:55:07.004]  It's about conquest abroad and exploitation and about repression at home.
[02:55:08.803 --> 02:55:10.845]  There's not an inkling of that.
[02:55:11.606 --> 02:55:13.207]  The show's almost over, Dr. Breeding.
[02:55:13.427 --> 02:55:17.930]  You heard him slide in the comment, too, about, well, I don't like martial law, but that brings safety.
[02:55:18.571 --> 02:55:19.271]  Plug your book.
[02:55:19.411 --> 02:55:20.632]  I carry both your books.
[02:55:20.652 --> 02:55:21.793]  You get a discount if you get both.
[02:55:21.853 --> 02:55:23.935]  It's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:24.195 --> 02:55:26.136]  In 30 seconds, tell us about Wildest Colts.
[02:55:26.697 --> 02:55:28.398]  The Wildest Colts make the best horses.
[02:55:28.438 --> 02:55:29.679]  The title speaks for itself.
[02:55:29.739 --> 02:55:35.343]  It's about defending the spiritedness and autonomy and thinkingness of our children, protecting them from
[02:55:36.139 --> 02:55:36.580]  Uh huh.
[02:55:41.246 --> 02:55:45.167]  The nature of children and how best to promote their glorious development.
[02:55:45.207 --> 02:55:47.528]  That's what that one's about, and the other book as well.
[02:55:48.048 --> 02:55:49.368]  Okay, Dr. Breeding, we're out of time.
[02:55:49.408 --> 02:55:50.929]  Look forward to talking to you again on air soon.
[02:55:50.949 --> 02:55:51.489]  God bless you.
[02:55:51.589 --> 02:55:52.029]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:55:52.329 --> 02:55:52.729]  Take care.
