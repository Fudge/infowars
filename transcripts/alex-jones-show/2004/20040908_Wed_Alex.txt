[00:00:05.753 --> 00:00:06.393]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:08.094]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:09.935]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:11.416]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.177 --> 00:00:13.057]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:17.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.063]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.305 --> 00:00:30.808]  Well, well, well, it is already the eighth day of September 2004.
[00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:31.508]  Ultramassive
[00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:36.423]  Broadcast lined up for you.
[00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:45.848]  We have the American spectator, Ryder, who was arrested for absolutely no reason by the police in New York coming on the broadcast.
[00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:55.213]  I'm also lining up a Pacifica reporter where they stole his video and audio tapes and then released him and laughed at him.
[00:00:56.514 --> 00:01:00.696]  And there were AP reporters, Reuters reporters, mainstream TV cameras.
[00:01:00.897 --> 00:01:03.418]  If anybody caught the cops beating some innocent person up,
[00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:05.888]  They'd beat them up and take them to jail.
[00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.912]  All part of the new freedom that I experienced in New York City.
[00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:19.397]  And I literally had to dig my heels in and act like a, act like it was a dog fight to not be arrested three times a day at least.
[00:01:20.077 --> 00:01:26.702]  I would just have to bug my eyes out and kind of pull a Obi-Wan Kenobi on them.
[00:01:26.722 --> 00:01:28.403]  You don't need to see my identification.
[00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:29.984]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:31.705]  Over and over again,
[00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:33.986]  Just to get them to leave us alone.
[00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:40.331]  I mean, just to... Literally, it's like a dog-like mentality of if you act official and powerful, they back off.
[00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:42.332]  Just amazing.
[00:01:43.193 --> 00:01:44.614]  And again, that's an analogy, folks.
[00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:47.576]  I don't want the New York Times to say I think I'm Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:53.120]  Terrorists got orders from abroad, did not speak Chechen.
[00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:59.385]  Again, terrorists got orders from abroad, did not speak Chechen.
[00:02:01.124 --> 00:02:03.325]  Another headline, this is out of the Irish Examiner.
[00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:06.667]  Local police may have helped terrorists plan Russian siege.
[00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:09.208]  Why is this the case in every case?
[00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:12.329]  It just never ends, people.
[00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.672]  Another headline, police suspected of complicity in school siege.
[00:02:17.812 --> 00:02:18.592]  Oh, another one!
[00:02:19.753 --> 00:02:20.413]  Another one!
[00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:28.397]  Whether it's Columbine, or Putin blowing up buildings, or 9-11, it just never ends.
[00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.870]  There's another one.
[00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.591]  Local police may have helped terrorists plan Russian attack.
[00:02:35.112 --> 00:02:38.694]  Hurricane Ivan, speaking of Russian, threatens Caribbean islands.
[00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:40.634]  Man, what is going on with these hurricanes?
[00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:45.216]  I got a friend who's going scuba diving this weekend down there.
[00:02:45.616 --> 00:02:47.517]  I guess this is going to rain on his parade.
[00:02:47.537 --> 00:02:51.098]  Hope it doesn't, but I guess there's more serious things in the world.
[00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:53.459]  Re-enter the Matrix.
[00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.741]  Multi-state anti-terrorism project regroups after early mishaps.
[00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:09.208]  The government always with tips, or Matrix, or Echelon, or any of these programs, after heat develops against it, they claim it's cancelled, then it comes back with expanded funding.
[00:03:10.248 --> 00:03:13.149]  It's a psychological warfare tactic they use, we'll get into that.
[00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.991]  Cheney warns against vote for Kerry, he says there will be a terror attack if he wins.
[00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:23.653]  Kind of like when he said on Meet the Press two years ago that if you continue to investigate 9-11, you will ensure larger terror attacks.
[00:03:23.693 --> 00:03:24.834]  Then he laughed and smiled.
[00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:29.218]  Kerry considered Bill banning gun he waves.
[00:03:29.338 --> 00:03:34.462]  An article I never got to yesterday, he's waving the semi-auto shotgun and Kerry would like to ban that shotgun.
[00:03:35.863 --> 00:03:38.305]  We have his Bill that he introduced.
[00:03:39.046 --> 00:03:44.410]  And fanning the hysteria about Iran, NPR leads the charge to war!
[00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:48.133]  Saddam's General is working as U.S.
[00:03:48.153 --> 00:03:50.675]  Military Consultant inside of AFP.
[00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:52.432]  Report!
[00:03:52.492 --> 00:03:54.414]  Bush short on guard duty!
[00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:55.515]  UPI!
[00:03:56.635 --> 00:04:00.758]  Bush bisexuality asserted in new scorching book!
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.305]  And, uh, this is what Sherman Skolnick's been claiming for a while, and now it comes up in Kitty Kelly's books that have turned out to be very accurate in the past!
[00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:13.868]  Yeah, skull and bones, my friends!
[00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:19.692]  I mean, we got the New York Post with them bussing in the male porn stars to, quote, service the world leaders!
[00:04:19.832 --> 00:04:20.713]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:26.195]  I guess I'm not a Christian conservative because I don't bus in male porn stars.
[00:04:26.715 --> 00:04:34.721]  You gotta worship Satan and bus in male porn stars to, uh, to, uh, gay male porn stars to be a Christian.
[00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:36.823]  Well, I guess then I'm not the modern Christian.
[00:04:39.605 --> 00:04:45.029]  Hey, ask Arnold about all that stuff, posing for those type of magazines.
[00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:46.730]  He hasn't been a member since 1986.
[00:04:48.423 --> 00:04:49.665]  I guess it's a prerequisite.
[00:04:50.426 --> 00:04:51.107]  We'll be back.
[00:04:51.247 --> 00:04:52.629]  I haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:53.951]  Ultramassive broadcast.
[00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:58.997]  PrisonPlanet.tv and FullWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:59.017 --> 00:04:59.538]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:09.174]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.614 --> 00:05:13.855]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:21.117]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.497 --> 00:05:27.599]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:28.959]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:32.242]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.402 --> 00:05:34.424]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:41.992]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.272 --> 00:05:45.656]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:50.742]  Call today.
[00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:09.887]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:10.107 --> 00:06:21.395]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.595 --> 00:06:24.217]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.577 --> 00:06:31.042]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:31.202 --> 00:06:33.084]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.284 --> 00:06:39.308]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:45.213]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:50.922]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.098 --> 00:07:05.442]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.622 --> 00:07:10.046]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:10.186 --> 00:07:14.589]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.609 --> 00:07:15.951]  The New World Order.
[00:07:16.711 --> 00:07:17.492]  Can emerge.
[00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:21.977]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:22.037 --> 00:07:28.985]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:29.085 --> 00:07:31.108]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:31.428 --> 00:07:41.892]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:42.092 --> 00:07:47.474]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:08:05.907 --> 00:08:06.547]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.227 --> 00:08:08.267]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.987 --> 00:08:10.088]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.728 --> 00:08:11.568]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:13.229]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:17.550]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.152]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.371]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:33.652 --> 00:08:34.532]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:35.593]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:35.633 --> 00:08:36.894]  Back from 9 to Midnight Central.
[00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:37.254]  I'm here.
[00:08:37.274 --> 00:08:38.535]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:41.478]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:41.558 --> 00:08:43.219]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:48.323]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll start going to your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:48.343 --> 00:08:51.566]  We have several guests coming on today.
[00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:55.189]  Reporters that were brutally arrested for absolutely no reason.
[00:08:55.469 --> 00:08:56.630]  Left-leaning reporters.
[00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.611]  Right-wing reporters.
[00:08:57.671 --> 00:08:58.191]  You name it.
[00:08:58.231 --> 00:08:59.132]  That's coming up.
[00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:14.831]  I also want to get into an article that I wrote with Paul Watson yesterday because more attention is now coming out about all the drills that were being run on or around 9-11 of hijacked jets being flown into buildings and how that was used to confuse and have NORAD stand down.
[00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:19.654]  And I tell you what, let's go ahead and start with this now.
[00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:26.987]  War Games were cover for the operational execution of 9-11 by Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:09:27.087 --> 00:09:37.377]  For almost three years since 9-11, independent researchers have stockpiled individual smoking guns which prove that the official version of events was not only a lie but operationally impossible.
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:51.614]  However, no single smoking gun has yet been forwarded to explain why air defenses categorically reversed standard operating procedure and failed to respond to hijacked jet airliners until now.
[00:09:51.634 --> 00:09:59.763]  And again, we have the article over a year ago where Cheney was in Site R and took control of things in order to stand down, but the tales remain classified.
[00:09:59.803 --> 00:10:00.784]  We have links for all that.
[00:10:01.807 --> 00:10:08.754]  It is clear that at least 5 if not 6 training exercises were in operation in the days leading up to and on the morning of 9-11.
[00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:14.379]  This meant that NORAD radar screens showed as many as 22 hijacked airliners at the same time.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.988]  NORAD had been briefed that there was part of an exercise drill and that therefore normal reactive procedure was forestalled and delayed.
[00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:38.591]  The large numbers of blips on NORAD screens that displayed both real and drill hijacked planes explained why confused press reports emerged hours after the attack stating that up to eight planes had been hijacked.
[00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:40.632]  You can click here for that article.
[00:10:41.532 --> 00:10:49.175]  The drill scenario also explains a comment made by air traffic control personnel which was featured in July 2004 BBC television report.
[00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:54.018]  You can click there for the video of that report.
[00:10:54.798 --> 00:11:02.882]  The air traffic controller just told that a hijacked airliner is heading for New York and responds by saying, is this real world or the exercise?
[00:11:04.283 --> 00:11:10.286]  Alex Jones was one of the first to highlight the war games in his documentary film, Masters of Terror, released two years ago.
[00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:16.356]  And it says click here to watch a video clip from that two-year-old film.
[00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:24.609]  Alex explains why the Associated Press later had to admit the fact that the CIA were running drills of crashing planes in the buildings on the morning of 9-11.
[00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.633]  What were the drills called and what was their nature?
[00:11:30.893 --> 00:11:33.055]  Number one was Operation Northern Vigilance.
[00:11:33.155 --> 00:11:40.301]  This was planned months in advance of 9-11 and ensured that on the morning of 9-11, jet fighters were removed from patrolling the U.S.
[00:11:40.361 --> 00:11:42.283]  East Coast and sent to Alaska and Canada.
[00:11:42.844 --> 00:11:46.127]  Therefore, reducing the amount of fighter planes available to protect the East Coast.
[00:11:46.627 --> 00:11:49.270]  Number two, Bio-Warfare Exercise Tripod 2.
[00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:52.805]  I remember, first it was Kennedy, then it was Kenney.
[00:11:54.286 --> 00:11:58.669]  He was up there on, two days after the attacks, on national television.
[00:11:58.709 --> 00:12:00.631]  We have that video clip, we have a link to that.
[00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:05.815]  Where he says, well we were there on September 10th, and we responded with the exercise that morning.
[00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:09.477]  And then the government denied that and said it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:12:09.517 --> 00:12:16.723]  Then Giuliani, a few months ago, before the commission, admitted it and said, oh thank God, we were already out of the buildings and had it set up on the pier.
[00:12:17.845 --> 00:12:20.226]  So again, Biowarfare Exercise Tripod 2.
[00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:28.570]  Alex Jones first reported on this back in May when Rudolph Giuliani let the details of it slip in his testimony for the 9-11 Commission.
[00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:41.437]  FEMA arrived in New York on September 10th to set up a command post located at Pier 29 under the auspices of a biowarfare exercise scheduled for September 12th.
[00:12:44.016 --> 00:12:54.804]  This explains why Tom Kenny of FEMA's National Urban Search and Rescue Team told Dan Rather of CBS News that FEMA had arrived in New York on the night of September 10th.
[00:12:55.164 --> 00:12:57.526]  This was originally dismissed as a slip of the tongue.
[00:12:57.826 --> 00:13:03.931]  Giuliani was to use this post as the command post on 9-11 after he evacuated WTC Building 7.
[00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:12.119]  As reported back in January, Giuliani knew when to leave WTC7 because he got an advance warning that the trade towers were about to collapse.
[00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.260]  That's ABC News.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.940]  We have a clip of that.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.501]  Here's the quote.
[00:13:14.841 --> 00:13:16.303]  We were operating out of there.
[00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:19.105]  We were told that the World Trade Center was going to collapse.
[00:13:19.146 --> 00:13:21.628]  Rudolf Giuliani told Peter Jennings of ABC News.
[00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:28.595]  How did Giuliani know that the towers were about to collapse when no steel building in history had previously collapsed from fire damage?
[00:13:29.514 --> 00:13:32.095]  Number three, Operation Vigilant Guardian.
[00:13:32.435 --> 00:13:40.916]  This exercise simulated hijacked planes in the northeastern sector and started to coincide with 9-11 Lieutenant Colonel Dwayne Dickens.
[00:13:40.996 --> 00:13:46.658]  NORAD's Unit Airborne Control and Warning Officer was overseeing the exercise at 840 AM.
[00:13:46.898 --> 00:13:52.379]  She took a call from Boston Center, which said it had a hijacked airliner.
[00:13:52.939 --> 00:13:59.147]  Her first words, as quoted by Newhouse News Service, were, it must be part of the exercise.
[00:13:59.388 --> 00:14:08.900]  This is another example of how numerous drills on the morning of 9-11 deliberately distracted NORAD so that the real hijacked planes couldn't be intercepted in time.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.243]  Continuing.
[00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:14.882]  Number four, Operation Northern Guardian.
[00:14:14.922 --> 00:14:22.846]  The details of this exercise are still scant, but it is considered to be part of Vigilant Guardian, relating to simulating hijacked planes in the northeastern sector.
[00:14:23.524 --> 00:14:25.645]  Number 5, Operation Vigilant Warrior.
[00:14:25.685 --> 00:14:28.807]  This was referred to in Richard Clark's book, Against All Enemies.
[00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:32.490]  It is thought to have been an attack component of the Vigilant Guardian exercise.
[00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:41.816]  Another example of how air defenses were purposefully kept preoccupied so they couldn't protect New York was reported by the website, by this website in December of 2003.
[00:14:41.896 --> 00:14:48.580]  The Air National Guard's 177th Fighter Wing, based in Atlantic City, International Airport Pomona,
[00:14:49.338 --> 00:14:53.060]  We're just eight minutes away from New York and could have intercepted both Flight 11 and Flight 175.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:02.343]  Under NORAD procedures that date to the Cold War, two F-16 fighters from the 177th were parked around the clock on Atlantic City runway.
[00:15:02.643 --> 00:15:05.445]  Pilots waited in a nearby building, ready to scramble.
[00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:15.829]  But on the morning of 9-11, the F-16s were performing bombing runs over an empty stretch of the Pine Barrens near Atlantic City after being decommissioned
[00:15:16.744 --> 00:15:20.005]  From their usual role of protecting the skies of the East Coast.
[00:15:20.945 --> 00:15:23.506]  And, uh, the article continues, my friends.
[00:15:24.267 --> 00:15:31.049]  It was only after both towers were hit that the two F-16s landed and were refitted with air-to-air missiles, then sent aloft.
[00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:45.393]  Now that we have established how NORAD were confused, delayed, and distracted by the numerous war games, the next question to ask is who, if anyone, was aware of which planes were real world and which planes were exercise?
[00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:54.021]  The answer to this question will be provided to us with the name of the individual who ran the operational execution of the 9-11 attack, Dick Cheney.
[00:15:55.789 --> 00:16:02.671]  As the attack unfolded, Dick Cheney was running a command bunker in what the Philadelphia News describes as the Underground Pentagon.
[00:16:03.871 --> 00:16:23.316]  Site R, a highly secure complex of buildings inside Raven Rock Mountain near Blue Ridge Summit, PA, close to the Maryland-Pennsylvania state line and about seven miles north of Camp David, is a 53-year-old facility conceived at the start of the Cold War as an alternative command center in the event of a nuclear war and an attack on Washington.
[00:16:23.996 --> 00:16:28.541]  The bunker is built into a mountain hillside and is virtually camouflaged to the naked eye.
[00:16:28.882 --> 00:16:36.250]  The location betrays itself by the vast gaggle of satellites, dishes, microwave towers, and antenna that festoon the perimeter.
[00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:43.759]  Inside the facility, there are computer-filled caverns of communication and tracking technology that would put a James Bond movie to shame.
[00:16:44.423 --> 00:16:47.124]  The entire facility is guarded by heavily armed military police.
[00:16:47.444 --> 00:16:51.606]  Within hours of 9-11 unfolding, five chompers had landed at the facility.
[00:16:52.687 --> 00:16:58.009]  Helipad and top officials such as Paul Wolfowitz were ushered in to join Cheney in the command bunker.
[00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:06.814]  Site R, also known as Raven Rock or the alternative Joint Communication Center, is from where is the place where Vice President Dick Cheney executed the 9-11 attack.
[00:17:07.814 --> 00:17:12.157]  Cheney's command superseded the orders of the Pentagon, the FAA, and the White House.
[00:17:12.477 --> 00:17:15.519]  He is the number one suspect in the mass murder of nearly 3,000 innocent people.
[00:17:17.316 --> 00:17:23.780]  In May of 2001, by presidential order, Cheney was handed direct control of all war game and drill operations.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:34.645]  This meant he was solely in charge of the overlapping NORAD drills and war games on the morning of 9-11 that prevented standard operating procedure from being implemented and any of the hijacked planes being intercepted.
[00:17:35.066 --> 00:17:42.410]  The smoking guns of 9-11 are no longer disparate jigsaw pieces that serve just to raise more questions than they answer.
[00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.592]  We now have a coherent and plausible explanation of how the events unfolded.
[00:17:47.825 --> 00:17:52.867]  Why there was no air defense response and a prime suspect as to who executed these actions.
[00:17:53.208 --> 00:17:55.208]  The facts fit the version of events.
[00:17:55.769 --> 00:18:05.413]  The 9-11 truth movement has just taken a giant leap forward dismantling the lies of September 11th and finally offering justice for those who lost their lives on that terrible day.
[00:18:06.674 --> 00:18:11.396]  Now this is on PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:18:11.836 --> 00:18:15.838]  Right now it's full of links documenting every statement we make
[00:18:16.858 --> 00:18:37.567]  Other than one, and I'm having trouble finding it, it was about a year and a half ago, ABC News reported, ooh, Cheney was in a command bunker that morning as things happened, and took control of the situation, and was in communication with NORAD and the other command bunkers, quote, the shadow government, and he ordered them to do something, but that remains classified, the transcripts of that.
[00:18:37.988 --> 00:18:40.849]  We need to find that article, I remember it was ABC News,
[00:18:41.929 --> 00:18:43.811]  But it was a regional ABC News article.
[00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:45.012]  We need to find that article.
[00:18:45.033 --> 00:18:46.774]  We need to post that in here as well.
[00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:47.455]  That's key.
[00:18:48.316 --> 00:18:50.899]  I know all of you searching Google and other places can find it.
[00:18:50.919 --> 00:18:55.124]  I know it's in our archives, but it took us an hour or so to put this article together.
[00:18:55.164 --> 00:18:56.966]  I want to thank Paul Watson for doing a great job.
[00:18:56.986 --> 00:18:59.589]  We need to add that to this.
[00:19:00.842 --> 00:19:04.044]  Because no one can go read this article and not deny what happened.
[00:19:04.064 --> 00:19:04.925]  Let me boil it down.
[00:19:05.225 --> 00:19:17.994]  There was at least one drill on the morning of 9-11, executed at 8.30 in the morning, that the CIA was running, not out of Side R, but out of Langley, Virginia, of hijacked jets flying into landmarks in D.C.
[00:19:18.034 --> 00:19:18.674]  and New York.
[00:19:19.635 --> 00:19:21.956]  Now, what are the chances of that happening?
[00:19:22.036 --> 00:19:27.280]  And then that disproves their first lie, that they'd never heard of such plans to fly planes into buildings.
[00:19:27.907 --> 00:19:30.990]  Well, we have the drill that went on two years before 9-11.
[00:19:32.411 --> 00:19:33.332]  Or a year and a half.
[00:19:33.932 --> 00:19:38.376]  In November of 2000, where the Pentagon Protection Bureau did a drill of this.
[00:19:38.716 --> 00:19:41.899]  They had the drill six weeks before that ABC News reported on.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.861]  Need to add those two to this article.
[00:19:45.062 --> 00:19:46.563]  But they never heard of such a plan.
[00:19:47.004 --> 00:19:48.325]  This is how NORAD stood down.
[00:19:48.385 --> 00:19:49.285]  It's just a drill.
[00:19:49.766 --> 00:19:55.571]  We have two separate air traffic controllers on the record saying they were ordered to stand down and that they thought it was a drill.
[00:19:56.331 --> 00:19:58.221]  We'll be right back with your calls, more news.
[00:19:58.261 --> 00:19:58.965]  Please stay with us.
[00:20:01.522 --> 00:20:02.282]  Terrorism.
[00:20:02.422 --> 00:20:03.182]  Terrorism.
[00:20:03.282 --> 00:20:09.364]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:20:09.604 --> 00:20:11.204]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:20:11.444 --> 00:20:13.925]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:20:14.305 --> 00:20:28.868]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:28.908 --> 00:20:29.228]  government.
[00:20:29.388 --> 00:20:31.188]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:20:31.588 --> 00:20:37.493]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:20:37.633 --> 00:20:42.116]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:21:04.568 --> 00:21:07.988]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:21:08.489 --> 00:21:09.149]  Let's update.
[00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:13.110]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.511]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[00:21:18.171 --> 00:21:19.131]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:21.492]  dollar was worth 17% more than a year old.
[00:21:21.992 --> 00:21:22.912]  Today, the U.S.
[00:21:22.932 --> 00:21:25.173]  dollar is worth 28% less than a year old.
[00:21:25.553 --> 00:21:27.053]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:21:27.643 --> 00:21:29.626]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[00:21:30.988 --> 00:21:35.854]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:21:36.855 --> 00:21:39.018]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:41.982]  There's little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:21:42.583 --> 00:21:43.984]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:21:44.404 --> 00:21:46.125]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:21:46.525 --> 00:21:48.546]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:21:48.906 --> 00:21:51.027]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.

[00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:08.111]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:22:08.731 --> 00:22:12.612]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:22:13.313 --> 00:22:21.896]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:22:22.857 --> 00:22:30.020]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:22:30.954 --> 00:22:39.099]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:05.825 --> 00:23:06.126]  Joe?
[00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:08.869]  If you guessed they're all American heroes, you guessed right!
[00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.354]  But these heroes don't belong to any crack military commando unit.
[00:23:12.514 --> 00:23:15.217]  These true American heroes are American homing pigeons.
[00:23:15.638 --> 00:23:16.159]  That's right!
[00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:18.822]  Registered, pedigreed, American homing pigeons.
[00:23:19.042 --> 00:23:29.771]  Although the homing pigeon no longer delivers life-saving messages on the battlefield, they are engaged throughout the world at thoroughbreds and exciting racing contests that have become one of the fastest-growing sporting trends in the nation.
[00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:30.792]  Who races pigeons?
[00:23:31.052 --> 00:23:32.033]  Anybody and everybody!
[00:23:32.253 --> 00:23:34.836]  There's no age limit to the excitement of pigeon racing.
[00:23:34.976 --> 00:23:39.440]  All it takes to get involved with this great sport is to call the American Racing Pigeon Union toll-free 800-755-ARPU.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:39.940]  That's 800-755-ARPU.
[00:23:45.945 --> 00:23:49.050]  The American Racing Pigeon Union has clubs in every state in the U.S.
[00:23:49.231 --> 00:23:53.157]  For a great family sport and fun in your own backyard, call the ARPU today.
[00:23:53.177 --> 00:23:58.686]  800-755-ARPU or visit pigeons.org on the World Wide Web.
[00:24:21.275 --> 00:24:23.558]  Alright, we're about to go to your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:23.578 --> 00:24:31.326]  And we'll get into terrorists got orders from abroad, did not speak Chechen.
[00:24:31.346 --> 00:24:35.571]  Another headline, Scottish newspapers, Irish examiner.
[00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:39.034]  Local police may have helped terrorists plan Russian siege.
[00:24:39.555 --> 00:24:42.058]  Police suspected a complicity in school siege.
[00:24:42.902 --> 00:24:45.685]  It goes on and on as new developments come out there.
[00:24:45.725 --> 00:24:47.746]  The Matrix system is back with a vengeance.
[00:24:48.207 --> 00:24:49.868]  Hurricane Ivan, we'll get into that.
[00:24:50.429 --> 00:24:52.230]  Cheney warns against a vote for Kerry.
[00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.053]  Kerry's out waving guns that he would ban.
[00:24:55.933 --> 00:25:00.818]  We'll also get into even so-called liberal media like NPR calling for invading Iran.
[00:25:01.218 --> 00:25:02.819]  Saddam's generals working as U.S.
[00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:03.980]  military consultants.
[00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:09.205]  Kitty Kelly's new book, Bush's bisexuality asserted.
[00:25:10.555 --> 00:25:12.357]  All part of the Christian conservatism, folks.
[00:25:12.937 --> 00:25:15.319]  That's all coming up, only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:25:15.699 --> 00:25:17.821]  Mark in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[00:25:17.861 --> 00:25:18.201]  Welcome.
[00:25:19.042 --> 00:25:20.083]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:25:20.123 --> 00:25:20.343]  Good.
[00:25:20.363 --> 00:25:23.806]  I'm currently the Secretary of the Reform Party in Pennsylvania.
[00:25:24.466 --> 00:25:26.188]  I'm a longtime listener to your show.
[00:25:26.348 --> 00:25:28.009]  I've only been on there about twice.
[00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:37.477]  I hear a lot about all the September 11th crashes, particularly in New York, but we don't hear too much about the one that happened right here in Pennsylvania.
[00:25:38.177 --> 00:25:42.779]  Which was about 15 miles from Jennerstown in Somerset County.
[00:25:42.819 --> 00:25:45.321]  Well, it's admitted that Flight 93 was shot down.
[00:25:46.341 --> 00:25:46.881]  Yes, yes.
[00:25:46.901 --> 00:25:48.362]  That's what I want to get to now.
[00:25:49.162 --> 00:25:50.683]  Flight 93 crashed here.
[00:25:51.003 --> 00:25:55.045]  The day of the crash, the plane flew directly over my house.
[00:25:56.146 --> 00:26:01.208]  There were people working on a turnpike tower, which is about 100 feet from my house.
[00:26:01.328 --> 00:26:05.550]  They were on top of the tower and they saw the plane fly directly over the tower.
[00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.731]  It was going up and down.
[00:26:07.595 --> 00:26:09.056]  And, uh, tilting left and right.
[00:26:09.816 --> 00:26:12.537]  You know, just maybe there's a struggle going on or what, I don't know.
[00:26:12.797 --> 00:26:14.377]  But I, uh, got all that on tape.
[00:26:14.638 --> 00:26:17.919]  Uh, well, at least I got the interview of the workers on tape.
[00:26:18.139 --> 00:26:23.501]  And, uh, the FBI came to my house and picked that up about five months after, uh, 9-11.
[00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:29.103]  Uh, and just so you know... Hey, you didn't... you didn't give them the original, did you?
[00:26:29.783 --> 00:26:30.563]  No, I have copies.
[00:26:30.903 --> 00:26:31.263]  Oh, good.
[00:26:31.283 --> 00:26:32.544]  I'd like you to send me a copy of that.
[00:26:32.744 --> 00:26:33.624]  Yeah, of course I have copies.
[00:26:33.664 --> 00:26:34.805]  Yeah, I'll send you one there, Alex.
[00:26:35.565 --> 00:26:35.685]  Um...
[00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:42.479]  One of my friends was at a gas station here, uh, right about three hours after the plane crashed.
[00:26:43.139 --> 00:26:49.143]  There was an old man at the gas station that told him that, uh, he looked, you know, in the sky while this plane was coming down.
[00:26:49.603 --> 00:27:03.312]  Well, you know, maybe right before it was coming down, it was on the flight path, and he saw a, uh, another plane, uh, or an object, you know, I don't know if it was a cop or a plane, but it was a flying object, way above, uh, Flight 97, 93.
[00:27:03.432 --> 00:27:03.712]  And, uh,
[00:27:07.577 --> 00:27:14.083]  Well, sir, Deputy Police, State Police, uh, did see F-16s and did see an explosion in the debris field, was 8 miles long.
[00:27:24.608 --> 00:27:25.529]  Yeah, that's another thing.
[00:27:25.569 --> 00:27:30.512]  The engines were supposedly found a mile or so from the main wreckage.
[00:27:30.532 --> 00:27:34.634]  Yeah, and we've seen photos of them obviously blown into pieces, mushroomed.
[00:27:34.934 --> 00:27:36.255]  That's what a missile does to them.
[00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:39.197]  Engines don't just fall off eight miles away.
[00:27:40.117 --> 00:27:41.698]  If the plane crashes into the ground.
[00:27:42.659 --> 00:27:46.741]  Well, interestingly enough, the FBI came, I think about eight months.
[00:27:46.781 --> 00:27:50.103]  They sent one agent out here to my house to get the videotaped interviews.
[00:27:51.843 --> 00:27:56.165]  The agent asked me what I felt about the Cold War deal and I just let him have it.
[00:27:56.185 --> 00:28:01.647]  I told him about the New World Order and the government possibly being behind these things.
[00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:08.249]  He said, listen to me, and interestingly enough he said that there may be people within the organization that think the same way that I do.
[00:28:10.623 --> 00:28:17.748]  He gave me a job reference, because I do have a degree in criminology, in case I want to come down and file for the FBI, which I thought was very interesting.
[00:28:18.168 --> 00:28:39.783]  Yeah, there's a lot of good people in the FBI, and half of New Yorkers believe the government was behind it, Zogby Poll, and so that goes to show that a lot of the FBI agents, who aren't stupid, and who know evidence when they see it, know that the official story is a complete fraud.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.462]  Yeah, that's definitely a really good thing.
[00:28:43.302 --> 00:28:47.686]  He gave you a job reference when you told him about the New World Order and said that you thought the government was behind it.
[00:28:48.406 --> 00:28:49.507]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:50.048 --> 00:28:56.533]  I had a feeling that one day, maybe mysteriously, Agent Brady would disappear if I took that job.
[00:28:57.193 --> 00:28:59.115]  So, who knows?
[00:29:00.776 --> 00:29:02.678]  I mean, if he did that, he was probably a good guy.
[00:29:03.502 --> 00:29:04.242]  Yeah, I hope so.
[00:29:04.262 --> 00:29:10.604]  I mean, just assessing those statements, and I wasn't there, but assessing those statements, that doesn't sound like a setup to me.
[00:29:11.285 --> 00:29:11.885]  No, no.
[00:29:12.145 --> 00:29:20.227]  Because good FBI and good law enforcement are always trying to recruit other good people, just like the bad ones are always trying to recruit other bad ones.
[00:29:20.247 --> 00:29:22.188]  Of course, yeah.
[00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:27.730]  That's a reality, because we need people in there that are waking up to what's going on here.
[00:29:29.317 --> 00:29:34.139]  Well, don't think for a minute that FBI on the ground didn't find out the real story of Flight 93.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.740]  Hey, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.520]  Good to hear from you.
[00:29:37.861 --> 00:29:40.022]  Eric in Connecticut and others, we'll get to you when we get back.
[00:29:40.062 --> 00:29:41.822]  Get into more news.
[00:29:41.842 --> 00:29:45.564]  1-800-259-9231 on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:49.425]  It is the 8th day of September.
[00:29:51.746 --> 00:29:52.667]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.147 --> 00:29:54.787]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:58.349]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.458 --> 00:30:03.939]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:30:04.159 --> 00:30:11.506]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:30:11.806 --> 00:30:16.229]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:26.318]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:30.743]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:30:31.083 --> 00:30:33.566]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:30:33.586 --> 00:30:39.814]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:30:40.054 --> 00:30:41.576]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:30:41.856 --> 00:30:42.757]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:30:42.837 --> 00:30:45.820]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.901]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:30:46.921 --> 00:30:47.121]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:30:47.161 --> 00:30:50.224]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[00:30:50.244 --> 00:30:50.905]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:31:01.539 --> 00:31:04.560]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.861 --> 00:31:09.803]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:10.043 --> 00:31:14.425]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.705 --> 00:31:19.607]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[00:31:19.767 --> 00:31:23.609]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.829 --> 00:31:27.431]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.731 --> 00:31:32.760]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:33.061 --> 00:31:39.813]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.294 --> 00:31:40.834]  What about you?
[00:31:41.568 --> 00:31:46.932]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:31:46.992 --> 00:31:48.073]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:48.153 --> 00:31:50.034]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.228 --> 00:32:06.157]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flippin' it!
[00:32:06.478 --> 00:32:07.199]  Do you flip it?
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.945]  When I first started flippin' it, I couldn't believe my eyes!
[00:32:10.526 --> 00:32:12.491]  Once you start flippin' it, you'll never stop!
[00:32:13.018 --> 00:32:16.920]  The next time you pick up one of your beauty products, flip it over and examine the ingredients.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.841]  You'll be astonished by what the packaging reveals to you.
[00:32:20.301 --> 00:32:24.763]  Many mainstream beauty products are comprised almost entirely of synthetic petrochemicals.
[00:32:25.183 --> 00:32:33.587]  For a more natural approach to looking and feeling great, visit NaturalSkinAndHair.com or call their friendly and knowledgeable staff toll free at 1-866-339-SKIN.
[00:32:36.732 --> 00:32:41.115]  Start flipping it today because you really can look great without all the synthetic chemicals.
[00:32:41.636 --> 00:32:43.837]  Once you start flipping it, you'll be glad you did.
[00:32:44.077 --> 00:32:48.201]  Visit Naturalskinandhair.com for more information on natural beauty products.
[00:32:48.641 --> 00:32:49.361]  Do you flip it?
[00:32:49.662 --> 00:32:50.062]  Call 866-339-SKIN.
[00:32:50.082 --> 00:32:50.682]  That's 866-339-SKIN.
[00:32:50.762 --> 00:32:53.565]  Or visit Naturalskinandhair.com today.
[00:33:02.474 --> 00:33:07.597]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.277 --> 00:33:10.519]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:22.126 --> 00:33:28.767]  Alright, more of your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes on this live Wednesday edition at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:28.927 --> 00:33:30.928]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.028 --> 00:33:39.190]  Any issue you want to talk about, passing the thousand mark of troops being killed, plus 500 plus of the contractors, the mercenaries in Iraq.
[00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:43.551]  New developments on the Russian school situation, that tragedy.
[00:33:43.571 --> 00:33:46.691]  Just a bunch of key news that's coming up.
[00:33:46.771 --> 00:33:50.352]  Kitty Kelly's new book, talking about Bush's bisexuality.
[00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:53.150]  I guess, you know, Bohemian Grove, folks.
[00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:58.513]  You've got to worship Moloch and be into that stuff to be a Christian conservative, the new Christian conservatives.
[00:33:58.533 --> 00:34:01.335]  I guess that makes me evil, then, because I'm not for all that.
[00:34:02.015 --> 00:34:03.436]  But that's coming up as well.
[00:34:03.756 --> 00:34:08.139]  But I wanted to make a few key announcements here before we go any further.
[00:34:08.883 --> 00:34:11.464]  Number one, it's time to get prepared.
[00:34:11.944 --> 00:34:13.704]  Mentally, psychologically, spiritually.
[00:34:13.764 --> 00:34:15.785]  You need firearms to protect yourself.
[00:34:16.165 --> 00:34:20.406]  There's a breakdown of society which could happen very easily by design to bring in martial law.
[00:34:20.847 --> 00:34:21.847]  You need water filters.
[00:34:21.887 --> 00:34:23.027]  You need storable foods.
[00:34:23.787 --> 00:34:26.448]  And boy, if you need storable foods, we've got the place.
[00:34:26.848 --> 00:34:28.989]  I've gotten a year's supply from these folks.
[00:34:29.759 --> 00:34:31.180]  You can get a great deal from it.
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:32.960]  It's incredibly high quality food.
[00:34:33.561 --> 00:34:38.863]  Ruddy Reserve Foods has gained the reputation of providing virtually the finest dehydrated storable foods available.
[00:34:39.203 --> 00:34:45.005]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in the United States over 30 years old.
[00:34:45.874 --> 00:34:51.277]  Food units need no refrigeration because they are nitrogen packed, which vastly extends their shelf life.
[00:34:51.638 --> 00:34:55.320]  The food units are compact and can be customized to fit your individual needs.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:02.345]  Get a deluxe three-month food supply for one adult, normally $4.98, for half price by calling 800-453-2202 or visit them on the web at readyreservefoods.com.
[00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:16.889]  If you have been procrastinating because you don't know where to begin, call Ready Reserve Foods and ask for their free emergency preparedness checklist.
[00:35:17.269 --> 00:35:18.089]  It's a catalog.
[00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:29.192]  Or call now and get a deluxe three-month food supply of nitrogen-packed, storable food for half price for only $2.49 by calling 800-453-2202 or go to ReadyReserveFoods.com It is, in telling me, one of the Alex Jones specials.
[00:35:29.212 --> 00:35:29.312]  So 800-453-2202
[00:35:40.658 --> 00:35:45.622]  And then on top of that, my friends, my new film, American Dictators, is out.
[00:35:45.762 --> 00:35:47.543]  I mean, it's got Gary Busey in it.
[00:35:47.603 --> 00:35:50.705]  It's got Lord Bush in it.
[00:35:50.725 --> 00:35:54.848]  We expose Kerry and the Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove connection, how they're cousins.
[00:35:55.729 --> 00:35:58.011]  We interview Ralph Nader.
[00:35:58.651 --> 00:36:00.813]  We go around and expose the police state.
[00:36:01.273 --> 00:36:04.756]  It's an amazing new video, 90 minutes long, 1995, American Dictators.
[00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:13.694]  Available at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart.
[00:36:14.955 --> 00:36:20.116]  Or you can call toll free to get American Dictators or any of the other videos I produce, other videos I carry.
[00:36:20.556 --> 00:36:24.357]  My 9-11 films, Eric Huffman's 9-11 films, or Trump's 9-11 films.
[00:36:24.657 --> 00:36:30.079]  The best 9-11 films out there bar none that cover the stuff we can truly document and it will really wake people up.
[00:36:30.619 --> 00:36:33.219]  Toll free number to get any of my videos or the other videos.
[00:36:33.339 --> 00:36:35.300]  Ask about discounts on multiple orders.
[00:36:36.233 --> 00:36:58.038]  1-888-253-3139 That's 888-253-3139 Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com And we ship it out to you UPS, which is a little more expensive than USPS, but it gets to you a lot quicker.
[00:36:58.058 --> 00:37:04.240]  And it's like 50 cents more to get a second video, another 50 cents to get three videos.
[00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:10.864]  So it's, you know, seven bucks for shipping for one because it's like five to six dollars just for us in the shipping.
[00:37:11.865 --> 00:37:14.046]  But then a dollar to pay people to ship it.
[00:37:14.946 --> 00:37:19.169]  But it's a lot cheaper per capita when you get more videos.
[00:37:19.249 --> 00:37:22.750]  Plus, when you get three or more of my videos, you get an $18 discount.
[00:37:24.266 --> 00:37:29.807]  You get an $18 discount on three tapes, a $24 discount on four tapes, and so on and so forth.
[00:37:30.167 --> 00:37:34.688]  So 1-888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:37:34.988 --> 00:37:37.349]  Please take action and get the films today.
[00:37:52.372 --> 00:38:00.817]  And the other thing I wanted to plug, and I'm trying to find my press release here, it's in this giant stack of news articles, is a meeting tonight in Austin, Texas.
[00:38:00.897 --> 00:38:08.742]  And I want to warn you, all over the country, private individual radio stations that carry real conservative or libertarian programming are being bought up.
[00:38:09.645 --> 00:38:14.708]  Access television is being shut down all over the nation as we speak.
[00:38:14.808 --> 00:38:18.510]  It is thoroughly disgusting to watch this happen.
[00:38:19.231 --> 00:38:29.117]  And tonight in Austin, Texas, there's a key meeting of the Telecommunications Commission, that's the city council, three city council members, and the Austin Music Commission that want to take over free speech.
[00:38:29.784 --> 00:38:30.264]  We're good to go.
[00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:47.916]  And that is at 630 tonight.
[00:38:47.956 --> 00:38:51.060]  It's on Barton Springs Road, right behind Threadgill's.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:54.605]  It's one Texas Center, but 505, one Texas Center.
[00:38:54.926 --> 00:38:57.990]  Big ol' 12, 15 story, I don't know how many stories it is.
[00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.654]  It's a big city building, right behind it.
[00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:05.433]  Right behind Threadgill's on Barton Springs Road.
[00:39:05.993 --> 00:39:09.854]  And again, I'm trying to find my press release on that.
[00:39:10.354 --> 00:39:13.155]  It's oninfowars.com.
[00:39:13.696 --> 00:39:18.618]  If you want to go to the site, it says, key free speech fight coming up, ACTV.
[00:39:19.198 --> 00:39:23.119]  And you can get directions and read about the different things they're doing.
[00:39:23.159 --> 00:39:24.800]  And I did just find it.
[00:39:26.567 --> 00:39:30.669]  Again, lovers of free speech, it is imperative that you attend this Wednesday night's meeting.
[00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:35.752]  It will be a joint meeting between the City's Telecommunications Commission and the Austin Music Commission.
[00:39:36.032 --> 00:39:39.874]  They are going to try to certify a plan to take over AXS Television at this confab.
[00:39:40.514 --> 00:39:49.959]  And it's a joint meeting again, and it's tonight, September 8th at 6.30pm at 1 Texas Center, 505 Barton Springs Road, room 325.
[00:39:49.999 --> 00:39:50.540]  So, just there on
[00:39:58.294 --> 00:40:01.535]  On Barton Springs Road, right down by Congress, you can't miss it.
[00:40:01.575 --> 00:40:04.037]  It's a big old building and it says One Texas Center on it.
[00:40:04.137 --> 00:40:04.977]  It's room 325.
[00:40:06.138 --> 00:40:11.221]  Be there probably about 620 or so to sign up to speak or to sign up to give me your three minutes of time.
[00:40:11.241 --> 00:40:13.582]  Because I only get three minutes of time unless you give me some of your time.
[00:40:13.782 --> 00:40:15.483]  Then I can get a maximum of 15 minutes.
[00:40:15.743 --> 00:40:19.345]  There will be other key speakers there that I suggest you give your time if you don't want to speak.
[00:40:19.766 --> 00:40:21.987]  But it's very important for you to be there.
[00:40:22.834 --> 00:40:24.316]  And the newspapers will be there.
[00:40:24.576 --> 00:40:29.300]  And finally the newspaper last week, The Statesman, admitted it is a takeover of free speech.
[00:40:29.821 --> 00:40:34.525]  And the director of AXS TV admitted they were going to have to change the bylaws and the contract with the city to do this.
[00:40:35.106 --> 00:40:42.433]  This is the birthplace of AXS TV and I want to thank our national and international audience for putting up with this local issue week after week.
[00:40:42.493 --> 00:40:45.656]  But it's something that affects everyone, everywhere.
[00:40:46.326 --> 00:40:50.408]  All right, let's go to Eric in Connecticut and others, then I'll go back into all of this news.
[00:40:50.928 --> 00:40:51.969]  Eric, you're on the air.
[00:40:52.029 --> 00:40:52.369]  Welcome.
[00:40:52.769 --> 00:40:53.750]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:57.112]  I'm glad that you're safe and back from New York.
[00:40:57.132 --> 00:41:02.034]  Before I got into my main subject, I wanted to commend you for your work in the Big Apple.
[00:41:04.454 --> 00:41:13.141]  I wanted to also ask you, did you do a interview recently with John DeCamp, the former senator from Nebraska?
[00:41:13.181 --> 00:41:16.043]  I know you did an interview with him about the Franklin cover-up.
[00:41:16.083 --> 00:41:18.145]  I don't know how recent it was or when it was.
[00:41:19.946 --> 00:41:22.589]  We found a transcript of it posted on a website.
[00:41:22.609 --> 00:41:27.372]  Last time I interviewed him was about a year ago, but we recently, in the last month, posted that interview with him.
[00:41:27.773 --> 00:41:34.118]  Okay, the reason I mention this, Alex, is because I feel that this issue dovetails almost perfectly with this recent
[00:41:34.722 --> 00:41:35.863]  attack in Russia.
[00:41:38.324 --> 00:41:55.215]  A lot of people aren't really aware, more people are becoming aware, but not enough are aware of the level of kidnapping, murder, child sacrifices, satanic ritual that goes on in the highest levels of our nation.
[00:41:56.015 --> 00:42:01.018]  This was borne out by the book, The Franklin Cover-Up, by John DeCamp.
[00:42:01.759 --> 00:42:03.640]  He's a former senator from Nebraska,
[00:42:04.318 --> 00:42:12.720]  He was involved with the investigation of the Franklin cover-up, which involved the governor at the time of Nebraska, Bob Kerry.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:26.063]  And it's important that people realize that this scandal of child abuse, sexual abuse, and all the rest of it, went up to the highest levels of our government.
[00:42:27.104 --> 00:42:32.525]  This is borne out by numerous interviews that Mr. DeCamp conducted.
[00:42:33.692 --> 00:42:42.374]  other individuals involved with his efforts and Cardoree, a gentleman named Cardoree was murdered in a plane crash.
[00:42:42.554 --> 00:42:44.735]  He was getting statements from the victims.
[00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:48.856]  Let me just stop you because what you're saying is accurate.
[00:42:48.896 --> 00:42:50.236]  Let me give folks some background.
[00:42:51.837 --> 00:43:03.100]  Senator John DeCamp had been the head of the Republican Party in Nebraska, state senator, and they raided, the police because of corruption, raided the savings and loan in Lincoln.
[00:43:03.917 --> 00:43:10.301]  And in it, found all these videos and photos of horrible things happening to small children and young boys.
[00:43:11.462 --> 00:43:24.309]  And then the FBI swooped in and grabbed it, and the Republican Party in Nebraska said, John, who was a big Vietnam veteran, former CIA guy in Vietnam, they said, Mr. DeCamp, we want to hire you to go in
[00:43:32.615 --> 00:43:35.399]  And basically investigate this and kind of whitewash it.
[00:43:35.419 --> 00:43:47.112]  Well then he found out all this stuff was true, that the children told him about places, this was before this was even in the news, with a big owl and big redwood trees and children having their heads blown off.
[00:43:47.962 --> 00:43:55.049]  And just all this horrible stuff, and then his state investigator called him, was with his son, had his own plane.
[00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.890]  He was in Chicago.
[00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:57.031]  He goes, I've got the evidence.
[00:43:57.091 --> 00:43:58.031]  We can burn them all.
[00:43:58.292 --> 00:43:59.373]  This goes to the highest levels.
[00:43:59.633 --> 00:44:03.657]  His plane blew up in the air, flying back to Lincoln, Nebraska.
[00:44:04.197 --> 00:44:05.598]  He was with his son, if I remember.
[00:44:05.618 --> 00:44:06.559]  Yeah, he was with his son.
[00:44:06.579 --> 00:44:09.862]  That's what I'm saying about Mr. DeKamp's investigator.
[00:44:10.143 --> 00:44:11.404]  Then other people died.
[00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:30.829]  And he then went to other states, investigators, talked to other police who'd uncovered similar connections to this, and it's so horrific, but on PrisonPlanet.com we have a giant section, elite sex rings, about the kidnapping of women and children, hundreds of mainstream articles, BBC, Reuters, AP,
[00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:42.517]  Hundreds of women's dead bodies dug up, children's dead bodies dug up, royalty of Europe connected to it, dead children found on their property, the heads of media, the heads of banking.
[00:44:42.837 --> 00:44:48.120]  This is how they bind them to the cult to make sure they've got dirt on them and to basically get their souls.
[00:44:48.941 --> 00:44:56.125]  And again, then we've got the New York Post about top gay porn stars shipped to Bohemian Grove to quote service them.
[00:44:57.102 --> 00:44:58.103]  That was a few months ago.
[00:44:58.443 --> 00:45:05.388]  Articles 15 years old out of, you know, Parade Magazine, Spy Magazine, about the male prostitutes being bust in.
[00:45:05.748 --> 00:45:06.628]  You know, all of this.
[00:45:06.668 --> 00:45:08.930]  Just this debauchery that we can confirm.
[00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:10.071]  We can confirm that.
[00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:17.075]  And then now there's all of this, and then DynCorp gets caught in 2000, chipping out 200,000 women and children who were kidnapped.
[00:45:17.316 --> 00:45:18.456]  They get convicted of it.
[00:45:18.696 --> 00:45:22.579]  We have all those mainstream articles, and DynCorp's the big company getting the contracts in Iraq.
[00:45:23.079 --> 00:45:24.280]  You're absolutely right, sir.
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.781]  And this is big.
[00:45:26.422 --> 00:45:26.982]  And by the way,
[00:45:28.023 --> 00:45:47.135]  John DeCamp, for years, has been putting out updated versions of his book, giving speeches, doing hundreds of radio interviews, made a documentary about it, and one Virginia TV station about eight years ago called him a liar.
[00:45:48.357 --> 00:45:52.459]  And he sued them for 1.4 million dollars and won.
[00:45:52.899 --> 00:45:53.419]  That's right.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:46:09.787]  So people need to understand, this is a guy who was mainstream, didn't believe in this stuff, found out about it, had his investigators killed, and he wrote a book exposing it, naming names, and somebody in a TV station said he was a liar.
[00:46:10.127 --> 00:46:11.407]  He sued them and won.
[00:46:12.408 --> 00:46:14.709]  So this has been also documented in court.
[00:46:15.827 --> 00:46:19.028]  And yes, it's horrible, it's hard to believe, but it's what's going on.
[00:46:19.408 --> 00:46:20.409]  One last thing, Alex.
[00:46:21.369 --> 00:46:26.471]  There was going to be a Discovery Channel documentary on this in 1994.
[00:46:26.611 --> 00:46:30.672]  I've aired that video here locally in Austin.
[00:46:31.072 --> 00:46:39.775]  I think it would be great if you could air the interview again with John DeCamp.
[00:46:39.835 --> 00:46:43.876]  My point is, when these leaders talk about the children and their
[00:46:44.537 --> 00:46:45.858]  Sympathy for the children.
[00:46:46.458 --> 00:46:48.960]  And how it's so bad that what happened to these children.
[00:46:49.661 --> 00:46:52.163]  It's basically as phony as Harlock's tears.
[00:46:52.963 --> 00:46:54.545]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[00:46:54.625 --> 00:46:56.066]  I really appreciate it.
[00:46:56.186 --> 00:46:57.387]  Chad in Missouri.
[00:46:57.427 --> 00:46:58.167]  Chad, you're on the air.
[00:46:58.187 --> 00:46:58.568]  Go ahead.
[00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:02.530]  Go ahead, Chad.
[00:47:03.631 --> 00:47:05.333]  Yeah, I was kind of weird.
[00:47:05.373 --> 00:47:09.796]  What he was talking about, that's what I was going to ask about John DeCamp.
[00:47:09.856 --> 00:47:11.057]  I had that interview.
[00:47:12.059 --> 00:47:27.124]  So you did with him and uh... on my laptop and my laptop's fried and I've been trying to find his book all over the... I'm a truck driver and I've stopped at all kinds of bookstores trying to find it and uh... I'd like to see if you had his number or a way to get his book.
[00:47:27.324 --> 00:47:32.806]  Yeah, on the spot I don't have his number for you uh... but uh... I believe on the website?
[00:47:33.426 --> 00:47:36.107]  Yeah.
[00:47:36.848 --> 00:47:39.489]  The transcript will have his address and information on it.
[00:47:40.149 --> 00:47:40.429]  Okay.
[00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:48.843]  And I was also going to ask you about the possibility if you've ever talked to the satellite radios to try to get on there?
[00:47:49.823 --> 00:47:59.185]  We have done that and those negotiations have been going on in perpetuity for the last few years and we're a little bit too edgy for the satellite people.
[00:48:00.685 --> 00:48:02.286]  Imagine that, huh?
[00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:03.466]  Yeah, imagine that.
[00:48:05.405 --> 00:48:10.268]  Alright, well, uh, yeah, it's just kinda, I've been going crazy out here driving a truck trying to find your, uh, show on there.
[00:48:10.308 --> 00:48:12.190]  Well, you know, uh, sir, try Amazon.
[00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:13.250]  I know it's on Amazon.
[00:48:14.451 --> 00:48:18.214]  Amazon, uh... What's that, uh... Ha ha, yeah.
[00:48:18.634 --> 00:48:20.375]  It's the big, uh, online bookstore.
[00:48:20.575 --> 00:48:21.816]  No, I'm talking about your show.
[00:48:21.836 --> 00:48:25.939]  As far as, you know, being out on the road, not being able to, uh, hear your show anymore.
[00:48:25.979 --> 00:48:29.021]  I used to listen to it, you know, streamlined on the internet.
[00:48:30.582 --> 00:48:31.983]  Oh, and now you're a truck driver.
[00:48:32.043 --> 00:48:33.324]  Well, get yourself a shortwave.
[00:48:34.696 --> 00:48:35.677]  Yeah, I'm going to try that.
[00:48:35.937 --> 00:48:37.297]  Here's a shortwave radio.
[00:48:37.317 --> 00:48:39.238]  It comes in pretty good almost all over the country.
[00:48:39.939 --> 00:48:43.841]  We're on WWCR 9.475 during the day, 3210 at night.
[00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:45.702]  Okay, I appreciate it Alex.
[00:48:46.062 --> 00:48:48.003]  Alright, I appreciate your call sir.
[00:48:48.383 --> 00:48:49.644]  Let's talk to Daryl.
[00:48:50.124 --> 00:48:51.325]  Daryl, where are you calling us from?
[00:48:51.745 --> 00:48:59.249]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to say a few words about your three best videos, which I also feel are the three best videos available to the Patriot community.
[00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:02.391]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror,
[00:49:02.921 --> 00:49:05.082]  And please state three, total enslavement.
[00:49:05.322 --> 00:49:21.190]  And all of your videos, especially the Masters of Terror, they show the connection to the past of Nero burning Rome and Hitler with the Reichstag, showing that governments do indeed sponsor and carry out terrorism to promote their own agenda.
[00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:27.073]  So I just urge everybody, if they don't have those videos, pick up all three and you'll save some money by buying three of them.
[00:49:27.671 --> 00:49:32.192]  And I'm anxiously awaiting your latest video, American Dictators, which I'm sure is going to be another great one.
[00:49:32.212 --> 00:49:45.416]  I ordered that the 27th of August, and I'd like to encourage you, Alex, to put a very high priority on your upcoming video that will contain the film footage from your recent visit into the belly of the high-tech police state on steroids in New York City.
[00:49:46.156 --> 00:49:52.698]  And lastly, I'd like most sincerely to thank you and Violet, Paul Watson, and all the technicians that helped you on those videos.
[00:49:53.171 --> 00:50:01.957]  For your great videos and for your great websites that contain a ton of information like InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanetTV, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:02.898 --> 00:50:10.964]  I just urge everyone to go up and look on those websites, print off articles, and just take advantage of the great info resources that you got there, Alex.
[00:50:11.004 --> 00:50:12.925]  So, God bless you and thank you for all you do.
[00:50:13.165 --> 00:50:13.946]  Well, thank you, Darrell.
[00:50:14.006 --> 00:50:14.966]  I appreciate the call.
[00:50:15.086 --> 00:50:18.549]  And yeah, what happened is we got a lot more orders for this video than I thought we would.
[00:50:19.375 --> 00:50:26.699]  And we had a pre-order and then we started offering it and then it sold out immediately and we just got in another shipment so your deal should be in the mail.
[00:50:26.719 --> 00:50:32.783]  Normally you get something in four or five days when you order it from us, a day or two to process and three days to get to your UPS ground.
[00:50:32.823 --> 00:50:35.084]  So that's probably on its way to you, sir.
[00:50:35.704 --> 00:50:37.566]  But we did run out of those unexpectedly.
[00:50:38.006 --> 00:50:41.188]  Alright, we will be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:42.188 --> 00:50:43.769]  We'll go to more calls and more news.
[00:50:43.789 --> 00:50:44.990]  We've got a guest coming up as well.
[00:50:45.998 --> 00:50:51.045]  1-800-259-9231 and I appreciate all the kind comments.
[00:50:51.706 --> 00:50:54.489]  And yeah, treat the stranger than fiction, the globalists are pure evil.
[00:50:54.810 --> 00:51:00.878]  We'll also get into the Russian school situation, new developments came out, documenting our suspicions.
[00:51:02.344 --> 00:51:09.751]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.012 --> 00:51:14.736]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:14.976 --> 00:51:20.622]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.862 --> 00:51:32.750]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:37.273]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.473 --> 00:51:39.995]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.215 --> 00:51:46.979]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:47.179 --> 00:51:48.080]  Order online now!

[00:53:02.535 --> 00:53:02.856]  I think so.
[00:53:17.779 --> 00:53:18.420]  We're good to go.

[00:54:08.098 --> 00:54:12.359]  Sean McComber of the American Spectator Magazine.
[00:54:13.019 --> 00:54:13.859]  Very conservative.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.140]  He'll be joining us.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.240]  He was arrested for no reason at the convention.
[00:54:18.981 --> 00:54:20.641]  Just documenting what we went through.
[00:54:20.661 --> 00:54:24.622]  By the grace of God, we were not arrested, though we were detained several times and interrogated.
[00:54:24.642 --> 00:54:27.642]  But he was arrested for quite a while and didn't go to the camp.
[00:54:28.182 --> 00:54:31.003]  So we'll get an inside view from the camp, the Freedom Center.
[00:54:31.886 --> 00:54:34.247]  After he was captured in the freedom fencing, as they were calling it.
[00:54:35.067 --> 00:54:37.349]  But let's go back to the calls, as promised.
[00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:38.169]  Hank!
[00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:40.010]  Hank, where are you calling us from today?
[00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:42.911]  San Antonio.
[00:54:42.951 --> 00:54:43.671]  Go ahead, welcome.
[00:54:44.332 --> 00:54:44.712]  Thank you.
[00:54:45.152 --> 00:54:56.437]  Alex, this thing about 9-11 and the NORAD standing down because it was a drill was scheduled.
[00:54:56.917 --> 00:54:59.278]  I'm wondering, why would they stand down?
[00:54:59.338 --> 00:55:00.599]  Because they were trying to figure out
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:05.129]  How to actually attack these buildings?
[00:55:05.149 --> 00:55:06.131]  Yeah, we have the central...
[00:55:09.703 --> 00:55:12.405]  FAA system that's controlled by the Pentagon.
[00:55:13.246 --> 00:55:16.088]  On the record mainstream, the one we thought it was a drill.
[00:55:16.469 --> 00:55:19.871]  We have another air traffic controller in BBC saying we thought it was a drill.
[00:55:20.552 --> 00:55:24.976]  Then we have at least two separate drills that morning.
[00:55:25.016 --> 00:55:31.882]  The big one we first learned of two plus years ago where the CIA was running drills applying hijacked jets into the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[00:55:32.342 --> 00:55:33.303]  That was used.
[00:55:33.363 --> 00:55:35.325]  People thought it was until the first plane hit.
[00:55:35.625 --> 00:55:36.706]  They thought it was a drill.
[00:55:37.509 --> 00:55:40.891]  Okay, and Dick Cheney was in control of all this.
[00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:51.475]  But Alex, if it was a drill, shouldn't they have launched planes to try to intercept these practice attackers?
[00:55:51.715 --> 00:56:03.360]  Well, this was a simulation drill, and most of the jets were in Canada and Alaska and other areas on another drill, which was an on-the-ground, in-the-air drill.
[00:56:05.948 --> 00:56:07.449]  That sounds like a weak excuse to me.
[00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:09.551]  Well, these are right off the government's own websites.
[00:56:09.731 --> 00:56:10.792]  I mean, this is admitted.
[00:56:10.812 --> 00:56:13.475]  I mean, isn't that obvious?
[00:56:13.595 --> 00:56:17.458]  Well, number one, they said, no one had ever heard of plans to hijack jets and climb into buildings.
[00:56:17.918 --> 00:56:33.372]  Then we had all the articles from 95, 96, 98, 99, 2000, of missiles on top, the Genoa, Italy Economic Summit in 2001, of articles about Al-Cieda plans to fly planes in the World Trade Center, Pentagon, CIA, Capitol,
[00:56:34.212 --> 00:56:37.213]  But Connelisa Rice and Bush, we never heard of such a plan.
[00:56:37.233 --> 00:56:38.433]  We're not going to give you our memos.
[00:56:38.773 --> 00:56:41.034]  So that proves they're liars right there at that point.
[00:56:41.414 --> 00:56:47.115]  Then what's the chances of a drill with the exact same targets being targeted at the very same time?
[00:56:47.715 --> 00:56:48.855]  Give me a break, folks!
[00:56:49.435 --> 00:56:57.797]  Well, actually, I would have thought that were they planning a drill that they would have been on top of the situation because they were preparing for the drill.
[00:56:57.817 --> 00:57:00.638]  But Dick Cheney was in control of the drill.
[00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:03.691]  Yeah, I understand it.
[00:57:04.731 --> 00:57:11.555]  But I mean, what police officer, what FBI agent, what NSA individual out there listening can deny those facts?
[00:57:12.836 --> 00:57:13.937]  I mean, I challenge them!
[00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:16.438]  This is the facts!
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:26.444]  Well, you're doing a great job, Alex, and we're enjoying having you on the radio here in San Antonio.
[00:57:26.544 --> 00:57:27.525]  Maybe we'll get some more going.
[00:57:27.985 --> 00:57:28.926]  Alright, God bless you.
[00:57:29.926 --> 00:57:30.887]  I appreciate the call.
[00:57:32.373 --> 00:57:33.794]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:57:33.814 --> 00:57:37.056]  Let's talk to Rich in Colorado.
[00:57:37.076 --> 00:57:37.657]  Go ahead, Rich.
[00:57:38.237 --> 00:57:39.018]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:39.058 --> 00:57:40.899]  This is Rich.
[00:57:40.999 --> 00:57:41.439]  Thank you.
[00:57:41.499 --> 00:57:45.522]  I've been awakened last, about March or so, in terms of 9-11 and all that.
[00:57:46.102 --> 00:57:50.425]  And I was wondering, have you seen the R-O-K-K-E interview?
[00:57:51.786 --> 00:57:57.850]  It's an interview clip given by a total information analyst
[00:57:58.747 --> 00:58:11.833]  And basically, they were talking to an expert on depleted uranium, and off camera supposedly, but it was actually taped, they asked the question, was there depleted uranium found at the Pentagon?
[00:58:12.334 --> 00:58:16.496]  The doctor anonymously didn't want to reply, but instead turned the camera off.
[00:58:16.956 --> 00:58:20.718]  He then replied, yes, there was depleted uranium found at the Pentagon.
[00:58:20.738 --> 00:58:22.679]  No, I've seen that interview.
[00:58:22.719 --> 00:58:27.121]  That's about four months old, and it's amazing.
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:29.261]  Okay, great.
[00:58:29.301 --> 00:58:31.162]  Just wanted to make sure that you knew about that.
[00:58:31.182 --> 00:58:32.264]  Yeah, do me a favor though.
[00:58:32.344 --> 00:58:33.445]  Send me that link again.
[00:58:33.505 --> 00:58:36.688]  We might even air that audio to tipsandinfowars.com.
[00:58:37.329 --> 00:58:40.592]  And, uh, what's your thinking on this, uh, Crofton the Rubicon book coming out?
[00:58:40.932 --> 00:58:42.534]  I think it's great from what I hear.
[00:58:42.574 --> 00:58:45.517]  I'm glad, uh, Mike's, uh, Rupert's focusing in on the drills.
[00:58:46.257 --> 00:58:48.740]  Uh, he's a good writer and I'm glad more folks are focusing on that.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.001]  We've been focused on it for two years.
[00:58:50.301 --> 00:58:50.642]  We'll be back.
[00:58:58.038 --> 00:58:58.679]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.359 --> 00:59:00.420]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.121 --> 00:59:02.222]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.882 --> 00:59:03.723]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.463 --> 00:59:05.344]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.364 --> 00:59:09.708]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.208 --> 00:59:14.351]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.293 --> 00:59:22.058]  Alright, my friends, now into our number two on this Wednesday, the 8th of September, 2004 edition.
[00:59:25.518 --> 00:59:28.539]  Coming up, new developments concerning the Russian tragedy.
[00:59:28.779 --> 00:59:34.982]  Also, Kitty Kelly's new book getting into Bush's alleged bisexuality that we've heard a lot about in the past.
[00:59:35.482 --> 00:59:36.983]  We'll cover that.
[00:59:37.763 --> 00:59:41.505]  We'll also get into just a ton of police state news.
[00:59:41.565 --> 00:59:47.488]  Also, Kerry waving a gun at a photo op that he would ban under legislation he's tried to get passed.
[00:59:48.288 --> 00:59:50.169]  And just so much more.
[00:59:51.286 --> 00:59:54.007]  You do not want to miss that that's coming up.
[00:59:54.467 --> 01:00:03.649]  Right now, for the next 20-30 minutes or so, and then we'll get back to your calls, I am honored to have Scott Macomber on the broadcast with us.
[01:00:03.669 --> 01:00:09.391]  He's a writer for American Spectator Magazine, a very conservative publication that has done a lot of good work in the past.
[01:00:10.294 --> 01:00:20.324]  And he was there in New York while I was there, and I've interviewed AP reporters, I've talked to reporters from Pacifica who were just randomly grabbed, had their tapes and notes stolen from them.
[01:00:21.165 --> 01:00:28.132]  Well, this is a conservative, and his story is amazing, what happened to Sean McComber.
[01:00:28.832 --> 01:00:30.354]  And Sean, it's good to have you on with us.
[01:00:30.754 --> 01:00:31.555]  Well, glad to be here.
[01:00:32.088 --> 01:00:32.528]  You bet.
[01:00:33.509 --> 01:00:43.656]  We're about to break here in a minute, but just in a nutshell, tell us about what you were doing in New York, what happened to you, and then I want to get into what happened when you were inside the makeshift jail and the rest of it.
[01:00:43.976 --> 01:01:01.169]  Well, basically what happened was I was covering a protest that had just really gotten underway, and the police wrapped an entire street in orange mesh fencing and basically said everybody inside the mesh was under arrest.
[01:01:03.019 --> 01:01:30.256]  And, you know, despite the fact that I was clearly not a protester dressed in a suit, and I had congressional press credentials, and despite the fact that the Secret Service showed up to make sure I wasn't one of these people that had stolen credentials to infiltrate the convention, as a few other people did at a couple points during the convention, you know, I went through a 40-minute interview with these Secret Service people.
[01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:33.110]  Thoroughly confirmed who I was.
[01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:34.431]  Not a lot of fun.
[01:01:35.971 --> 01:01:41.752]  For those of you who haven't had the experience, I say, turn it down if you can.
[01:01:43.192 --> 01:01:46.913]  Anyway, so the Secret Service says, yes, this guy is who he says he is.
[01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:47.793]  He's a reporter.
[01:01:48.754 --> 01:01:59.996]  And the New York police officer on duty, the DCPI person in charge, basically their publicity person, the person, the press liaison, said, no, you know,
[01:02:01.905 --> 01:02:02.845]  Take them away anyway.
[01:02:03.025 --> 01:02:14.734]  So, I was arrested and I was held for 15 hours without having my rights read to me or any explanation of what I was being charged with.
[01:02:15.094 --> 01:02:20.818]  And on top of that, they had let it fly that I was with a conservative magazine.
[01:02:21.699 --> 01:02:30.124]  And so, by the time I was put on the bus with the other protesters, the other arrestees, the other perps, as we were all called,
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.241]  I was the enemy.
[01:02:33.461 --> 01:02:34.862]  I was the bad man.
[01:02:35.183 --> 01:02:45.570]  So it's kind of interesting because people who have seen my writing understand that I come at things from kind of more of a libertarian bent.
[01:02:46.912 --> 01:02:50.734]  Although still, to your average protester, that probably doesn't mean anything.
[01:02:51.655 --> 01:02:57.099]  Except that when they were all shouting at me about, now you know how it feels.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.683]  There's other people in this country concerned with
[01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:09.543]  state power than, to be frank, a bunch of dirty hippies, basically.
[01:03:10.163 --> 01:03:14.766]  They're not the only ones who care about what's going on, but they're convinced they are.
[01:03:14.806 --> 01:03:25.272]  So I had a rather unpleasant evening, although, to their credit, some of the lower-ranking police officers apologized to me and said they thought it was totally out of line.
[01:03:25.332 --> 01:03:29.094]  And some of the protesters were nice to me in that, you know, you poor,
[01:03:30.123 --> 01:03:33.928]  Yeah, I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:03:33.948 --> 01:03:44.583]  I want to go over and detail what you just went over more specifically and then I want to get into what happened inside the camp on Pier 57 and much more.
[01:03:44.683 --> 01:03:45.364]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:03:45.384 --> 01:03:47.627]  We'll be right back with American Spectator journalist.
[01:03:53.508 --> 01:03:57.849]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:02.451]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.591 --> 01:04:06.973]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.013 --> 01:04:08.374]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.114 --> 01:04:09.535]  Panama.
[01:04:10.155 --> 01:04:14.379]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.439 --> 01:04:21.366]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.486 --> 01:04:23.508]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.888 --> 01:04:34.370]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:39.871]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:05:55.641 --> 01:05:59.044]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.

[01:06:17.238 --> 01:06:21.902]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.

[01:07:01.365 --> 01:07:04.387]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:14.015]  Alright, if your station carries the news, you just missed some incredible information, but we're about to recap it and go into more detail.
[01:07:14.776 --> 01:07:21.762]  Sean McComber is a writer for American Spectator Magazine, a very conservative slash libertarian publication.
[01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:28.297]  And I have talked personally to an AP reporter who was arrested for no reason.
[01:07:28.358 --> 01:07:29.578]  Randomly, I've interviewed.
[01:07:29.598 --> 01:07:30.999]  We're going to be having him on the show.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:40.466]  But while I was in New York, a senior Pacifica reporter who also went to Iraq and made documentaries there, he had his videos stolen out of his bag.
[01:07:40.966 --> 01:07:42.267]  He was only arrested for an hour.
[01:07:42.347 --> 01:07:45.429]  They stole his stuff, laughed at him, and gave it back to him, his video and audio.
[01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:48.251]  And there are scores of other articles of this happening.
[01:07:48.271 --> 01:07:50.713]  They would wrap... It even permitted protest.
[01:07:51.405 --> 01:08:06.676]  They would just wrap a big orange fence, that construction fence around you, and then arrest everyone, including 15-year-old children coming home from functions, old ladies in wheelchairs, French, American, British tourists.
[01:08:07.957 --> 01:08:15.462]  And that happened to Sean Macomber, and we have his article that he wrote about this posted on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:15.502 --> 01:08:17.744]  It's also at TheAmericanSpectator.com.
[01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:19.919]  So we'll be going over that with him.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.521]  Just describe it for us.
[01:08:22.541 --> 01:08:25.924]  You get to New York, tell us what day this happened, what you were covering.
[01:08:25.984 --> 01:08:30.128]  I mean, in detail, describe the events that took place.
[01:08:30.168 --> 01:08:34.531]  Because I don't think listeners, until they see the film I'm going to make out of this, called Martial Law, understand.
[01:08:35.152 --> 01:08:38.655]  I was threatened with arrest three separate times a day, at least.
[01:08:39.555 --> 01:08:42.638]  I was detained twice, once for over an hour and a half.
[01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:44.521]  I was shoved.
[01:08:44.962 --> 01:08:46.542]  I was squeezed.
[01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:48.743]  They would grab my arm and just squeeze it with hatred.
[01:08:49.363 --> 01:08:50.304]  I was clean cut.
[01:08:51.324 --> 01:08:58.507]  I had congressional, as he said, congressional, high-level passes into the center, into the floor.
[01:08:59.367 --> 01:09:01.088]  Okay, and these were for city-wide passes.
[01:09:01.108 --> 01:09:02.548]  The cops were supposed to bow down to these.
[01:09:03.428 --> 01:09:09.931]  I could go on the floor and get ten feet from George Bush Sr., from Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife and kids, and I did.
[01:09:11.042 --> 01:09:36.393]  Okay, but I could be eight miles away, anywhere in front of a fountain doing interviews with people and cops would run over and scream and cuss and threaten us and it came out the last day that we were there on Friday that there was a memo given to the police by their boss, the commissioner, how to ask if somebody was independent media how to harass them, if they were mainstream media how to kiss up to them and it's just incredible.
[01:09:37.734 --> 01:09:40.997]  It's like being in Iraq or something where they've been ordered to target independent journalists.
[01:09:41.497 --> 01:09:42.959]  And this was martial law, folks.
[01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:54.049]  When they could just randomly arrest you or threaten to arrest you, they smashed a lady's camera that we were with right in front of us and ripped the film out for photographing a homeless person and giving her five dollars.
[01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:57.613]  And the idiot cops, I was sitting there videotaping it while it happened.
[01:09:58.368 --> 01:10:05.634]  And yeah, a lot of cops by themselves were real nice, but in these groups, this group mentality, this brown shirt mentality took over.
[01:10:05.855 --> 01:10:07.556]  But again, that's enough of me introducing this.
[01:10:07.796 --> 01:10:10.018]  Sean McComber, writer for American Spectator.
[01:10:10.058 --> 01:10:11.419]  Go over what happened to you, please.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:25.992]  Well, basically what happened was I was covering a protest down by Ground Zero and I honestly hadn't even been planning on heading over there because there were so many protests in so many spots going on that day.
[01:10:27.554 --> 01:10:30.736]  I thought, because of the location, it might be interesting.
[01:10:30.816 --> 01:10:35.080]  Anyway, this protest barely got underway, maybe 30 seconds.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:39.383]  There's a short street over by Ground Zero.
[01:10:40.444 --> 01:10:42.105]  People started to march across it.
[01:10:42.826 --> 01:10:43.626]  Now, let me stop you.
[01:10:43.666 --> 01:10:47.049]  That's the one right there by the Millennium Hilton?
[01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.850]  Right.
[01:10:50.063 --> 01:10:52.165]  I got video then of you being arrested.
[01:10:52.185 --> 01:10:53.587]  I was across the street.
[01:10:53.707 --> 01:10:54.748]  I heard cops talking.
[01:10:55.048 --> 01:10:56.629]  It was a permanent protest by the way.
[01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:58.912]  They said, we got an order to arrest them.
[01:10:59.252 --> 01:11:02.195]  And I saw them start unfurling the fence and I stood back.
[01:11:03.156 --> 01:11:05.098]  And videotaped this as U.S.
[01:11:05.118 --> 01:11:07.680]  military laughed as you guys were being arrested.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.842]  So that was Tuesday, wasn't it?
[01:11:09.902 --> 01:11:10.222]  It was.
[01:11:10.462 --> 01:11:10.743]  It was.
[01:11:10.763 --> 01:11:12.164]  It was Tuesday around 4 o'clock.
[01:11:12.264 --> 01:11:13.164]  Yeah, at about 4 o'clock.
[01:11:13.305 --> 01:11:13.785]  I was there.
[01:11:14.426 --> 01:11:16.427]  I was there and I saw it coming so I stayed out of it.
[01:11:16.467 --> 01:11:17.488]  But please continue.
[01:11:17.568 --> 01:11:26.676]  Well, the interesting thing is I was interviewing people, basically doing my job, and I noticed the tension start to rise just as they crossed the street.
[01:11:27.336 --> 01:11:28.437]  If you were there, you might recall
[01:11:30.396 --> 01:11:33.658]  You know, the light changed so that people could use the crosswalk.
[01:11:34.199 --> 01:11:39.922]  And then it started flashing the don't walk signal and cops started yelling, arrest them, arrest them!
[01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:42.324]  The people in the street that were still in the crosswalk.
[01:11:42.904 --> 01:11:46.707]  And at that point I decided I better get out of the way.
[01:11:47.407 --> 01:11:57.534]  So I started to cross the street and a police officer said, no, go up ahead of the protest and cross at the next block.
[01:11:58.716 --> 01:12:03.957]  And, you know, lots of other people were just walking right by this guy, but, you know... Yeah, that's another thing they do.
[01:12:04.258 --> 01:12:07.658]  Once they get you in a protest, they cordon things off and herd you into an area.
[01:12:07.979 --> 01:12:15.661]  Yeah, so, anyway, so by the time I get up to the next block, my whole crime at this point is listening to a police officer and doing what he said.
[01:12:17.661 --> 01:12:24.103]  By the time I get up there, they've blocked off the whole side of the street and the front of the march with bikes.
[01:12:25.106 --> 01:12:25.867]  Cops on bikes.
[01:12:26.267 --> 01:12:28.908]  And there's a blimp overhead and three helicopters.
[01:12:29.089 --> 01:12:29.349]  Right.
[01:12:29.469 --> 01:12:33.972]  And they make an announcement that, you know, basically everybody move on.
[01:12:35.573 --> 01:12:46.160]  And it was an impossible thing to do because the police said, the police were actually impeding the march from moving forward, yet they said if the march didn't move forward, everybody would be under arrest.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.040]  Yeah, that's what they do.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.401]  We've seen this nationwide.
[01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:54.445]  And so 30 seconds later, they unfurl this orange fence and I said to the cop,
[01:12:55.595 --> 01:13:03.537]  Up at the end of the thing, I said, this is what your colleague said down there, and these are my press credentials, and he said, oh, don't worry, you'll get out.
[01:13:03.577 --> 01:13:05.098]  For the next two hours, that's all I heard.
[01:13:05.138 --> 01:13:05.698]  Don't worry.
[01:13:06.238 --> 01:13:06.798]  Don't worry.
[01:13:07.719 --> 01:13:13.200]  The Secret Service showed up to make sure I wasn't, you know, somebody who had stolen these passes.
[01:13:14.761 --> 01:13:17.682]  Well, yeah, they had announced that everybody was under arrest in this group.
[01:13:17.862 --> 01:13:18.142]  Right.
[01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:21.843]  And so the Secret Service takes me out of the pen, and
[01:13:24.016 --> 01:13:29.760]  Myself and an AP reporter actually, or an AP intern who had the same congressional passes.
[01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:32.262]  And they do all this stuff.
[01:13:32.302 --> 01:13:33.382]  They call my hotel.
[01:13:33.462 --> 01:13:35.964]  They ask me the same questions over and over again.
[01:13:37.265 --> 01:13:39.246]  They ask me why I'm carrying multiple IDs.
[01:13:40.827 --> 01:13:45.790]  The reason why I was carrying multiple IDs is one of them was my wife's old license.
[01:13:46.271 --> 01:13:51.214]  So it was, you know, I don't have an alias as a short blonde woman, but anyway,
[01:13:51.769 --> 01:13:58.252]  So I go through this whole hassle and then finally say, yes, this guy is who he says he is.
[01:13:58.673 --> 01:14:02.815]  The Secret Service tells the NYPD this guy is who he says he is.
[01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:03.875]  He's accredited.
[01:14:03.895 --> 01:14:05.096]  He's all set.
[01:14:06.297 --> 01:14:10.219]  And the New York Police Department says, well, we're going to arrest him anyway.
[01:14:10.859 --> 01:14:11.719]  Disturbing the peace.
[01:14:14.061 --> 01:14:18.503]  And I didn't find out that's what I was being arrested for until 15 hours later because
[01:14:19.401 --> 01:14:24.565]  I didn't have my rights read to me and I wasn't told why I was being held.
[01:14:24.645 --> 01:14:34.953]  I was moved all over the city and handcuffed and basically just hassled throughout the whole thing.
[01:14:35.273 --> 01:14:38.155]  You were in Pier 57 for a while while you were being transferred.
[01:14:38.195 --> 01:14:40.137]  Some people stayed there for over 24 hours.
[01:14:40.177 --> 01:14:42.899]  You were only there for a few hours from when I read your article.
[01:14:43.019 --> 01:14:44.180]  Let me just stop right there.
[01:14:45.017 --> 01:14:51.021]  Hey, I'm across the street videotaping all this, and I didn't even realize that I'd caught the protest that you were in covering.
[01:14:52.181 --> 01:14:55.723]  Understand, this was an accredited march.
[01:14:55.784 --> 01:15:04.849]  The next day they went and got an injunction against the city, because the next day I was there, and they were threatening to arrest another protest that was up at Ground Zero.
[01:15:04.889 --> 01:15:06.790]  They have the cops with the machine guns, the U.S.
[01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:08.071]  Army with the machine guns,
[01:15:09.092 --> 01:15:15.779]  They had the helicopters in the blimps and they were getting around us again and I had cops run over and threatened to arrest me and I just said, I'm going to sue you.
[01:15:16.319 --> 01:15:18.241]  I got your badge number memorized.
[01:15:18.261 --> 01:15:19.542]  This is all on video by the way.
[01:15:20.043 --> 01:15:21.464]  This is America, folks!
[01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:29.272]  Accredited marches, peacefully standing there and you get arrested or threatened to be arrested by these people.
[01:15:29.752 --> 01:15:31.013]  This is the new America.
[01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:33.335]  This is martial law.
[01:15:34.136 --> 01:16:02.243]  Can you tell us about when you went to Pier 57, this is again, this condemned building, this old bus station where they stored buses, huge, out over the big river there, the Hudson River, and you guys are in there, and the photos have been released of phones that got snuck in that could take photos, barbed wire with Constantina inside, you had to ask permission to get out to go to the Porta Potty, can you describe to us what it was like in there?
[01:16:03.234 --> 01:16:08.836]  Yeah, it was basically, it looked like any small town dog pound, really.
[01:16:11.016 --> 01:16:19.198]  Cement floor, real dirty with just giant fences blocking people off.
[01:16:19.238 --> 01:16:23.940]  And there's probably groups of 40 or so people in every cage.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:28.921]  And there was just people all over the place, wherever you could see.
[01:16:28.961 --> 01:16:30.862]  And you could see the new people being processed.
[01:16:33.129 --> 01:16:33.709]  Here and there.
[01:16:34.849 --> 01:16:56.395]  So inside this huge building, in 95 degree heat, you've got all these cages with barbed wire on top of them, with no bathrooms, people laying on the floor, 60 years of motor oil and chemicals where buses used to be stored, in this old 1930's building, and we would try to go and videotape the building, cops would run across the street and threaten to arrest us there!
[01:16:56.935 --> 01:16:57.316]  Oh really?
[01:16:58.436 --> 01:17:01.977]  Yeah, well, it was an interesting place.
[01:17:03.007 --> 01:17:09.192]  I'm sorry to hear that people had to spend 24 hours in there, but I was ready to go after three, to tell you the truth.
[01:17:09.432 --> 01:17:10.793]  Where did they take you after you were there?
[01:17:11.574 --> 01:17:18.699]  Well, they took us on a bus for just, it seemed like, the most roundabout route to central booking.
[01:17:20.641 --> 01:17:22.963]  You know, not far from where I was arrested, actually.
[01:17:25.393 --> 01:17:28.334]  You know, from there we went through all the mug shot stuff.
[01:17:28.594 --> 01:17:30.034]  So they took you to Center Street?
[01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:32.195]  Yeah.
[01:17:32.595 --> 01:17:37.096]  By the way, did you see the article where they took leaders of the protest to the mental institution?
[01:17:37.656 --> 01:17:37.936]  No.
[01:17:38.957 --> 01:17:40.517]  That was on New York 1.
[01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:43.418]  What's the name of the big famous New York mental institution?
[01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:44.158]  Belleville?
[01:17:44.438 --> 01:17:44.798]  Right.
[01:17:45.038 --> 01:17:46.919]  Yeah, they took hundreds of people there.
[01:17:47.399 --> 01:17:48.979]  It's the Soviet Union or something.
[01:17:49.279 --> 01:17:54.621]  Yeah, well they were saying that, you know, the funny thing is when this whole protest was gathering
[01:17:55.853 --> 01:18:10.460]  Earlier in the afternoon, probably three o'clock, I heard the police saying to one another and to certain protesters that were making conversation with them that they had the capability to arrest a thousand people a day.
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.181]  And I thought that was just strange because
[01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:17.910]  Up until that point, only, what, less than 200 people had been arrested before Tuesday, I believe.
[01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:27.472]  But they wanted to beef up the infrastructure, they wanted to train the cops in massive arrests and processing, and now state guards all over the country are gearing up for that, Sean.
[01:18:28.892 --> 01:18:40.875]  Yeah, well, it was pretty intense experience, and I think you definitely touched on it earlier when you were talking about the group thing, the kind of mentality that was going on, because
[01:18:41.993 --> 01:18:49.679]  There was definitely this feeling like they had been granted certain powers and they were determined to use them whether they were necessary or not.
[01:18:49.699 --> 01:18:50.380]  That's right!
[01:18:51.218 --> 01:18:52.438]  Me cop, you little people.
[01:18:52.458 --> 01:18:53.139]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.699 --> 01:18:56.980]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:01.201]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:19:01.461 --> 01:19:04.262]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:19:04.442 --> 01:19:06.843]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:19:07.023 --> 01:19:10.004]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI.
[01:19:11.564 --> 01:19:12.085]  We're good to go!
[01:19:30.103 --> 01:19:31.004]  We're good to go.
[01:19:54.781 --> 01:19:56.562]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[01:19:57.063 --> 01:20:00.486]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:20:00.986 --> 01:20:01.647]  Let's update.
[01:20:02.167 --> 01:20:05.630]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:09.993]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:20:10.674 --> 01:20:11.635]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:20:11.655 --> 01:20:13.996]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[01:20:14.497 --> 01:20:15.418]  Today, the U.S.
[01:20:15.438 --> 01:20:17.679]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.561]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:20:20.151 --> 01:20:22.132]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[01:20:23.493 --> 01:20:28.356]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:20:29.337 --> 01:20:31.498]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[01:20:31.898 --> 01:20:34.440]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.

[01:20:36.896 --> 01:20:38.617]  Physical possession, private gold.

[01:21:53.414 --> 01:21:55.915]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:56.635 --> 01:22:01.876]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:22:02.716 --> 01:22:09.598]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:22:10.658 --> 01:22:19.200]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:22:20.333 --> 01:22:28.355]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:31.656 --> 01:22:32.016]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:44.008 --> 01:22:44.588]  Call now.
[01:22:44.608 --> 01:22:50.070]  Operators are standing by to receive your order for a free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[01:23:12.621 --> 01:23:19.344]  Alright, Pam and Barry and Mike and Mike and Jimmy and everybody else, your calls are coming up here in the next segment and a bunch of other news.
[01:23:20.185 --> 01:23:24.887]  We're talking to Sean McComber and he of course writes for American Spectator Magazine.
[01:23:25.827 --> 01:23:27.688]  He's written an article about what happened to him there.
[01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:34.151]  And the point he just amplified that I had made is that this was about being God.
[01:23:34.171 --> 01:23:35.812]  This was about the government being Lord.
[01:23:36.172 --> 01:23:38.773]  This was about not having any Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[01:23:40.063 --> 01:23:45.267]  I mean, just arbitrarily conservative, liberal reporters, people in suits, children.
[01:23:45.307 --> 01:23:49.210]  They were just arrested just because they wanted to arrest thousands of people and put them in camps.
[01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:58.037]  And then anarchists would set something on fire, a papier-mâché dragon or whatever the case may be, and then nothing would happen to them.
[01:23:58.057 --> 01:24:01.320]  They'd run off and the cops would stand around and then arrest randomly a couple hundred people.
[01:24:02.241 --> 01:24:05.523]  And at any one time they had over a thousand people in this Pier 57.
[01:24:06.484 --> 01:24:07.465]  This is nightmarish.
[01:24:08.385 --> 01:24:10.907]  Well, just lying in motor oil, lying on the floor.
[01:24:11.947 --> 01:24:16.150]  And they're setting this precedent for nationwide implementation.
[01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:17.731]  I've got the government documents on it.
[01:24:18.952 --> 01:24:26.257]  Sean, before you went to New York, before you covered this, could you have imagined that it would have been this bad?
[01:24:27.358 --> 01:24:28.198]  No, not at all.
[01:24:28.238 --> 01:24:36.544]  I mean, my general observation in various other protests I've
[01:24:37.719 --> 01:25:02.738]  Covered is that there's tension that that never really comes to fruition and I understand that does happen other places and I've been you know the only the only things that I've felt like I've been out of control when I've when I've covered a riot I covered something after a hockey game once where you know I ended up getting tear gassed with a bunch of people but that was totally different this was you know this was very much planned
[01:25:03.464 --> 01:25:06.629]  To go this way and to go out of control.
[01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:11.096]  And I would have never imagined that whole streets could be just cordoned off.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:21.383]  Well, yeah, when the Bulls win or lose, the Lakers win or lose, or some football team loses, there's routinely giant riots with deaths and cars being dumped over.
[01:25:21.663 --> 01:25:32.607]  But do you see them call out 41,000 police and helicopters and blimps and machine guns and dogs and hundreds of yards of orange fencing and setting up camps for that?
[01:25:32.747 --> 01:25:33.507]  No, you don't!
[01:25:33.747 --> 01:25:34.448]  No, exactly.
[01:25:34.788 --> 01:25:37.649]  No, I've never seen anything approaching this.
[01:25:39.884 --> 01:25:43.246]  It was definitely a surreal experience.
[01:25:43.446 --> 01:25:50.629]  I kept saying to the police officers in the booking area, you know, do you realize what's going on here?
[01:25:50.809 --> 01:25:53.030]  I mean, nobody is being protected from it.
[01:25:53.070 --> 01:26:01.954]  And not to mention, I wasn't assigned an arresting officer until after my interview with the Secret Service, and it had probably been two hours at that point.
[01:26:03.925 --> 01:26:06.087]  This guy wrote out a police report on what I'd done.
[01:26:06.247 --> 01:26:08.529]  He wasn't even there when what happened happened.
[01:26:08.549 --> 01:26:12.091]  But see, that type of corruption is now standard operating procedure.
[01:26:12.371 --> 01:26:14.493]  Twenty years ago, a cop would go to prison for that.
[01:26:14.573 --> 01:26:16.495]  Now it's just normal.
[01:26:16.835 --> 01:26:18.276]  This is the new Soviet America.
[01:26:18.316 --> 01:26:19.397]  We've got a few minutes left.
[01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:24.581]  Most of the protesters were informed and intelligent, but a lot of them were these communists.
[01:26:24.961 --> 01:26:26.242]  I didn't see any real anarchists.
[01:26:26.262 --> 01:26:27.403]  The anarchists are communists.
[01:26:27.423 --> 01:26:30.085]  The media calls them anarchists because communists aren't supposed to exist.
[01:26:30.939 --> 01:26:39.842]  And your article calls them communists, and we had them yell at us, threaten us, everything else, but it seemed like the cops were leaving them alone.
[01:26:40.282 --> 01:26:40.582]  Right.
[01:26:40.943 --> 01:26:42.223]  Well, it was strange.
[01:26:42.283 --> 01:26:52.367]  I'll tell you, the final holding area I was in, people made fun of me and used me as a lightning rod.
[01:26:53.547 --> 01:26:59.029]  But in Pier 57, I was actually spit on and kicked a couple times by people that just
[01:27:00.298 --> 01:27:03.319]  Well, let me tell you what I think the problem is here.
[01:27:03.419 --> 01:27:04.979]  The problem is
[01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:26.492]  You never have 100% of the people interested in civil rights, okay?
[01:27:26.712 --> 01:27:38.375]  I've done probably 40 radio shows on this now, and without fail, when a conservative calls in, he says it was my fault, and when a liberal calls in, they say, see, there's no problem with the police.
[01:27:38.395 --> 01:27:38.995]  Let me stop you.
[01:27:39.035 --> 01:27:45.957]  You're saying idiot so-called conservatives, Soviets that didn't even know it, are calling you saying it's your fault.
[01:27:46.057 --> 01:27:47.818]  That's how groveling they are!
[01:27:48.382 --> 01:27:57.129]  Yeah, and some have said, well, maybe it wasn't your fault, but it's not good for morale to criticize the police in this way.
[01:27:57.689 --> 01:27:58.670]  Oh, let me stop you.
[01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:05.355]  Listen, Michelle Malkin, Savage, they're all on the air saying, put people in camps that criticize the government.
[01:28:05.375 --> 01:28:06.336]  We've gotten to that point.
[01:28:06.876 --> 01:28:09.418]  Yeah, and this is exactly my point.
[01:28:09.478 --> 01:28:12.801]  Now, if this was the Democratic Convention and it was happening,
[01:28:13.211 --> 01:28:14.772]  Then it would be the exact opposite.
[01:28:14.812 --> 01:28:15.992]  And that's the problem.
[01:28:16.033 --> 01:28:23.356]  People are never interested, or the vast majority of people are never interested in arguing for civil rights at the same time.
[01:28:23.416 --> 01:28:32.261]  That is why during the Waco episode and Ruby Ridge and all that, you had conservatives arguing that civil rights were being violated.
[01:28:32.721 --> 01:28:35.383]  And now that their guy's in charge, there's a problem.
[01:28:35.403 --> 01:28:37.924]  You know, we need to get everybody on the same page and say, look, this is what's going on.
[01:28:37.944 --> 01:28:40.185]  I'll tell you what, I'm going to let you finish after the break, then we'll do the call.
[01:28:40.205 --> 01:28:41.126]  Stay five more minutes.
[01:28:41.146 --> 01:28:41.726]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.837 --> 01:28:46.847]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:50.458]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.204 --> 01:29:01.685]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.105 --> 01:29:06.346]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.

[01:29:13.988 --> 01:29:20.090]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:21.450]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:24.733]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.893 --> 01:29:26.915]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.

[01:30:52.974 --> 01:30:58.358]  Millions of people who've never set foot in a casino take a dangerous gamble every day.
[01:30:58.738 --> 01:31:00.399]  Living without health insurance.
[01:31:00.639 --> 01:31:02.721]  You can't afford not to have it.
[01:31:02.921 --> 01:31:05.583]  But affordable insurance can be hard to find.
[01:31:05.863 --> 01:31:11.487]  Especially if you're a hard-working entrepreneur or if you work for a company that doesn't offer benefits.

[01:31:59.992 --> 01:32:05.654]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:32:05.694 --> 01:32:18.520]  We're here blasting out on the AM and FM dial on wonderful affiliates from Los Angeles, California to Providence, Rhode Island from Pensacola, Florida to Denver, Colorado from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Kansas City, Missouri.

[01:32:27.446 --> 01:32:37.364]  I just want to spend a few more minutes with Sean McComber, America's Spectator writer, then we'll go to all these callers that are patiently holding them in the Russia situation and just so much more.
[01:32:41.716 --> 01:32:50.485]  You know, talking about... I hear neocons, who aren't real conservatives, call in and go, Muslims killed people at that school!
[01:32:50.625 --> 01:32:53.608]  Let's nuke the entire Middle East and kill all of them!
[01:32:53.948 --> 01:32:57.051]  Well, that's the attitude that the Muslim terrorists have, is kill everyone.
[01:32:57.391 --> 01:33:00.655]  So how do we then go kill innocent women and children and suddenly we're good?
[01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.456]  It's this double-think.
[01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:04.138]  Or, yes, liberals
[01:33:04.418 --> 01:33:09.959]  When conservatives get beat up by police, pro-life demonstrators peaceably are arrested and beat up and have their arms broken.
[01:33:09.979 --> 01:33:10.760]  I have video of this.
[01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:12.880]  We're being a hundred yards away from a clinic.
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:14.240]  They love it.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.101]  But when it happens to them, they hate it.
[01:33:16.181 --> 01:33:19.242]  And this is the fake left-right debate that we get into.
[01:33:19.322 --> 01:33:23.442]  And yeah, I had people on the streets hearing me do interviews that were critical of the police state.
[01:33:23.462 --> 01:33:24.323]  They'd go, shut up!
[01:33:24.363 --> 01:33:25.423]  You ought to be in a camp!
[01:33:26.013 --> 01:33:37.564]  Because they've been listening to Michelle Malcolm, the neocon princess, and Mrs. Treason, Ann Coulter, who we had on, who writes a book about the Patriot Act, but then says on air she hasn't read it, when I've written an award-winning analysis of it.
[01:33:38.325 --> 01:33:44.271]  We have Mr. Wiener, known as Mr. Savage, every day saying, put everybody in a camp that disagrees with the government, that's a quote.
[01:33:45.278 --> 01:33:47.439]  I mean, forced labor camp, excuse me.
[01:33:47.859 --> 01:33:55.801]  And so now we wonder why the cops have this attitude, and I don't like you, you're going to jail, and you're not going to have a lawyer, or you're going to disappear.
[01:33:55.861 --> 01:33:57.242]  Some people for 48 hours.
[01:33:57.662 --> 01:33:59.782]  You were just in there for 15 or 16 as you said.
[01:34:00.122 --> 01:34:00.342]  Right.
[01:34:00.462 --> 01:34:09.425]  And then you say you've done 40 interviews since you were arrested, and that the so-called conservatives call in, I thought we can serve the Constitution Bill of Rights,
[01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:14.087]  They call in and say, well, it's a good thing what happened to you, boy!
[01:34:14.107 --> 01:34:17.168]  You just shouldn't have been out there reporting!
[01:34:17.208 --> 01:34:19.029]  You shouldn't be criticizing the cops!
[01:34:19.329 --> 01:34:21.470]  It ain't good for morale!
[01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:26.971]  So I guess in Nazi Germany we shouldn't have criticized the SS because it isn't good for morale!
[01:34:27.191 --> 01:34:30.092]  So this idea has really gotten into the consciousness.
[01:34:30.693 --> 01:34:37.035]  Well, yeah, and it's a byproduct of, I think, a lot of our other problems, which is, you know, this
[01:34:39.011 --> 01:34:45.970]  distillation of political discourse down into basically you know
[01:34:48.261 --> 01:34:49.022]  A sports game.
[01:34:49.082 --> 01:34:55.245]  It's like football fans being excited when somebody on the other team gets some sort of injury that takes them out of the game.
[01:34:55.385 --> 01:34:55.865]  Exactly.
[01:34:55.925 --> 01:34:56.686]  They don't care.
[01:34:56.746 --> 01:35:02.068]  It's like Coke vs. Pepsi, Chevy vs. Ford, Redskins vs. Cowboys.
[01:35:02.388 --> 01:35:06.431]  The thinking process is switched off when both parties are controlled by the same people.
[01:35:06.691 --> 01:35:06.991]  Right.
[01:35:07.151 --> 01:35:12.954]  And so you have this problem where people cannot
[01:35:13.968 --> 01:35:15.969]  They can't see the hypocrisy of it.
[01:35:16.029 --> 01:35:25.813]  They can only see whether their side is winning or losing, which is exactly why both parties can sound exactly alike and have no real criticism for it.
[01:35:26.214 --> 01:35:33.417]  And that's also exactly why there's never more than 50% of the people interested in civil liberties in America.
[01:35:33.537 --> 01:35:35.018]  I've got to stop you.
[01:35:35.038 --> 01:35:35.798]  That's a great point.
[01:35:36.238 --> 01:35:44.810]  Here's Arnold Schwarzenegger giving a speech about how they were afraid to look at the cops, how they could be secretly arrested in Soviet Austria when he was a child.
[01:35:45.091 --> 01:35:47.334]  Well, that's what they're setting up in America.
[01:35:48.115 --> 01:35:50.976]  That's what we were living outside the convention center.
[01:35:51.356 --> 01:36:03.600]  Then on top of it, Arnold's pro-abortion, anti-gun, pro-open border, pro-gay marriage, all this stuff, and the conservatives were praising him like it was the second coming of Ronald Reagan!
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:05.320]  Well, that's exactly it.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.161]  It's like, well, what can he do for us?
[01:36:07.221 --> 01:36:07.821]  Can he move
[01:36:08.314 --> 01:36:09.955]  Can he move the ball downfield?
[01:36:10.536 --> 01:36:15.780]  And that's what you get when... I had a Republican friend last night tell me that.
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:19.123]  He goes, well, it's a big tent and Arnold can move it down the field.
[01:36:19.463 --> 01:36:23.706]  Yeah, move conservatives so far left, we're over there with Mao Zedong.
[01:36:25.087 --> 01:36:25.948]  Yeah, well, exactly.
[01:36:25.968 --> 01:36:27.549]  Yeah, they're moving the ball all right.
[01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:31.633]  Right, well, principle is counting for less and less.
[01:36:32.714 --> 01:36:37.415]  That's unfortunate, and that's why people need to try and break out of this mentality.
[01:36:37.435 --> 01:36:42.137]  Although, I have to tell you, I'm not that optimistic.
[01:36:42.317 --> 01:36:50.499]  Having spent those 15 hours in jail, people say to me, you know, who's organizing these people?
[01:36:50.559 --> 01:36:56.861]  Well, you know, if these folks were organized, then the revolution's not getting off the ground.
[01:36:58.368 --> 01:37:01.029]  There didn't seem to be any organizing factor there.
[01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:02.350]  Well, I just basically took it and just
[01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:18.791]  Yeah, because you probably would have been charged with assault if you'd have fought back.
[01:37:18.831 --> 01:37:26.695]  There was a sign up that actually said any fighting would result in an assault charge that could end up eight and a half to twenty-five years in jail.
[01:37:26.735 --> 01:37:38.120]  Now, that's probably an exaggeration, but the truth is, you know, people ask me where I was from to make sure that I was actually the evil conservative, and I would tell them, you know.
[01:37:40.531 --> 01:37:42.333]  You know, I'm interested in talking to people.
[01:37:42.393 --> 01:37:44.274]  I'll talk to anybody, no matter what they think.
[01:37:44.314 --> 01:37:47.857]  And there's some people, there's some protesters in there who wanted to talk to me.
[01:37:47.877 --> 01:37:50.018]  Well, what did you say when the people kicked you?
[01:37:50.358 --> 01:37:51.479]  Well, that's just it.
[01:37:51.519 --> 01:37:53.020]  They weren't interested in talking.
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:56.843]  You know, there was no point in saying anything... Shut up, capitalist pig!
[01:37:56.903 --> 01:38:01.286]  You're gonna get what you... Unless you wanted to get into a physical altercation.
[01:38:01.326 --> 01:38:03.147]  Too bad Stalin didn't kill you!
[01:38:03.448 --> 01:38:06.129]  Right, and that's just... Well, we had a bunch of commies.
[01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:07.911]  We had a bunch of commies at Central Park.
[01:38:08.651 --> 01:38:13.456]  Uh, that I was trying to interview, put on their bandanas and start kind of threatening us, and I just said, bring it on, baby!
[01:38:14.457 --> 01:38:19.141]  When Michael Moore's bodyguard rammed into me, I just rammed right back into him and freaked him out.
[01:38:19.781 --> 01:38:22.984]  I'm surprised you got anywhere near him.
[01:38:23.705 --> 01:38:31.552]  Hey, listen, Sean, I want to thank you for coming on, and I thank you for illustrating what we saw here to a conservative slash libertarian writer.
[01:38:32.193 --> 01:38:34.595]  I experienced what you experienced, minus the arrest.
[01:38:35.296 --> 01:38:45.199]  Being screamed at, being grabbed, they grabbed my elbow at a pressure point and just squeezed it with hatred and spit and just yell in my face, I'm gonna arrest you right now boy!
[01:38:45.219 --> 01:38:47.980]  And I finally just started saying, good, I'm gonna sue you personally, I got your badge number.
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:39:02.405]  Well, you know, people kept saying to me, the police kept saying to two officers, one on the bus, one in Pier 57, kept saying, we're the heroes, we're the heroes, and you know, maybe it's true, but you know, one act of heroism or
[01:39:03.052 --> 01:39:11.335]  You know, however many of these individual officers that... It's not a blanket statement that you can do whatever you want for the rest of your life.
[01:39:11.375 --> 01:39:20.599]  And I'd just like to say one more thing, which is, you know, yeah, I'm on here as a conservative libertarian writer, but the fact of the matter is, this is what happened to people, you know?
[01:39:21.539 --> 01:39:29.922]  And the sooner people can start thinking in those terms, like, look at a situation and say, not who did it happen to, but whether it was right or wrong,
[01:39:31.838 --> 01:39:36.640]  Sooner we'll be able to make more moral and reasonable decisions.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:46.444]  Well, I just want to warn conservatives when Kerry or Hillary is in office, and this is happening to you, just remember, hey, thank you for joining us, Sean, and give folks the website for the American Spectator.
[01:39:46.665 --> 01:39:47.805]  Tell them the title of your article.
[01:39:48.205 --> 01:39:53.428]  It's www.spectator.org, and the article is called Jailhouse Red.
[01:39:53.928 --> 01:39:54.948]  Alright, thanks for joining us.
[01:39:55.008 --> 01:39:55.248]  Thanks.
[01:39:56.249 --> 01:40:00.050]  Well, there you heard it, folks, and it's exactly what we experienced.
[01:40:00.090 --> 01:40:01.091]  It was nightmarish.
[01:40:02.614 --> 01:40:09.019]  And having cops put their hands on you, you'd be sitting there interviewing somebody on the street with nobody around you, and all of a sudden a hand would just grab you.
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:11.301]  What the bleep are you doing?
[01:40:11.622 --> 01:40:12.923]  What do you think you're doing?
[01:40:13.603 --> 01:40:14.504]  I'm interviewing somebody.
[01:40:14.524 --> 01:40:16.005]  Are those press credentials real?
[01:40:16.045 --> 01:40:17.426]  Well, they are, but I have the First Amendment.
[01:40:17.446 --> 01:40:18.227]  That's my credential.
[01:40:18.968 --> 01:40:19.428]  Shut up!
[01:40:19.528 --> 01:40:20.429]  I'm doing the talking!
[01:40:21.249 --> 01:40:22.370]  Did I ask you to talk?
[01:40:22.450 --> 01:40:26.854]  And I'm like, this is obviously some former drill sergeant, and I'm going, uh, I'm going to sue you.
[01:40:26.894 --> 01:40:27.615]  Go ahead and arrest me.
[01:40:27.995 --> 01:40:28.936]  I finally learned how to do that.
[01:40:28.956 --> 01:40:29.937]  They would instantly back off.
[01:40:30.197 --> 01:40:31.318]  If you were nice, man,
[01:40:32.003 --> 01:40:33.304]  Well, they get the cuffs out.
[01:40:34.605 --> 01:40:36.766]  It was literally like tribal posturing.
[01:40:36.806 --> 01:40:39.868]  Like I was a wilderbeest posturing to another wilderbeest.
[01:40:40.309 --> 01:40:41.309]  It was bee steel.
[01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:45.412]  And, uh, you know, I just...
[01:40:46.889 --> 01:40:47.730]  It was disgusting.
[01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:50.832]  It was disgusting to watch a woman cry and have them write down her numbers.
[01:40:50.852 --> 01:40:51.652]  We're going to report you.
[01:40:51.693 --> 01:40:52.473]  We're going to see who you are.
[01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:53.734]  Smash your camera.
[01:40:54.234 --> 01:40:54.795]  Please don't.
[01:40:54.835 --> 01:40:55.856]  Please don't put me on the terror list.
[01:40:55.916 --> 01:40:56.796]  Oh, yes we are.
[01:40:57.156 --> 01:40:57.757]  Oh, yes.
[01:40:58.237 --> 01:40:59.598]  Oh, please officer, no.
[01:41:00.079 --> 01:41:01.560]  Please, no, no.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:02.600]  We're in control now.
[01:41:02.741 --> 01:41:03.661]  We've got the power.
[01:41:03.781 --> 01:41:04.822]  And it's only going to get worse.
[01:41:05.863 --> 01:41:07.504]  I mean, this is America, folks.
[01:41:07.544 --> 01:41:08.625]  This is what it's turned into.
[01:41:09.341 --> 01:41:14.245]  All right, let's talk to Pam in New Mexico, then Barry, Mike, Mike, Jimmy, and others.
[01:41:14.385 --> 01:41:15.386]  Let's go quick callers.
[01:41:15.666 --> 01:41:16.467]  Pam, thanks for holding.
[01:41:16.487 --> 01:41:16.847]  Go ahead.
[01:41:16.867 --> 01:41:18.168]  Hi, Alex.
[01:41:18.468 --> 01:41:19.929]  I wanted to ask you two questions.
[01:41:20.150 --> 01:41:21.911]  One, are there pending lawsuits?
[01:41:21.931 --> 01:41:25.033]  You mentioned suing these people, these monsters.
[01:41:26.264 --> 01:41:29.825]  Are you going to sue, and are other people going to sue them?
[01:41:29.905 --> 01:41:37.708]  No, I would tell them I'm going to sue you personally, and there are a bunch of lawsuits being filed, but most of these establishment lawyers don't know how to sue cops individually.
[01:41:38.508 --> 01:41:40.088]  But yeah, there are a bunch of suits being filed.
[01:41:40.408 --> 01:41:41.129]  Good, good.
[01:41:41.469 --> 01:41:45.250]  By the way, the authorities don't care about telling cops to do stuff that will get them in trouble.
[01:41:47.511 --> 01:41:47.751]  Right.
[01:41:48.131 --> 01:41:54.393]  The other question I have is, I've read Paul Joseph Watson's Order Out of Chaos, and I've
[01:41:55.775 --> 01:42:09.892]  9-1-1 wrote to tyranny your book and plus a bunch of others including David Ray Griffin's book and only in yours and Paul Joseph Larson's book have you mentioned the secret FBI document 199-I-N-F-I-R-S-E.
[01:42:11.482 --> 01:42:12.422]  WF213589.
[01:42:12.522 --> 01:42:17.965]  It was issued two months prior to 9-11.
[01:42:17.985 --> 01:42:22.106]  Ordering the FBI not to stop Al Qaeda and to protect the Bin Ladens.
[01:42:22.687 --> 01:42:22.987]  Right.
[01:42:23.207 --> 01:42:30.190]  And we not only have that document, we have FBI agents talking about it in Masters of Terror at the National Press Club with Judicial Watch.
[01:42:30.230 --> 01:42:35.332]  But yeah, that was in the BBC, the Times of London, and it's mainstream news and we just put it in the books.
[01:42:35.472 --> 01:42:35.812]  Right.
[01:42:36.032 --> 01:42:38.293]  And I wanted to tell you that I googled that
[01:42:38.733 --> 01:42:45.301]  I was in an argument with my uncle who said, no this is not a 9-1-1, this is not an FBI document.
[01:42:45.361 --> 01:42:52.449]  I said yes it is and I googled it and I sent him a whole bunch of proof from the BBC and ABC and a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:42:54.592 --> 01:43:11.025]  All we do, all we do is take the stuff over the last three years and point out the full spectrum and there's always some new person claiming they broke the new news story and frankly we almost always broke it first because I have been, I knew about 9-11 that was going to take place before it happened.
[01:43:12.125 --> 01:43:17.810]  And I'm not bragging, we've got all the answers but people need to pay attention to what we're doing.
[01:43:18.473 --> 01:43:30.263]  Yeah, but I just want to tell you, since then, subsequent to that, I got on and googled it again and some of the stuff that I had found before had all been erased.
[01:43:31.044 --> 01:43:37.730]  Yeah, some stuff is happening, but we have all the articles saved in the 9-11 sections of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:43.615]  But I mean, I want to tell you, people are out there erasing things that were before on there.
[01:43:44.716 --> 01:43:48.439]  Erasing whole sections of websites.
[01:43:48.599 --> 01:43:49.859]  How deep was your search?
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:55.543]  Well, um, I, hmm, probably not as deep as it could have been.
[01:43:55.563 --> 01:43:56.184]  Let me explain.
[01:43:56.504 --> 01:44:04.669]  And yes, stuff does get erased, but usually the search spiders go out and scan and look at what's being visited most.
[01:44:04.809 --> 01:44:05.790]  Those go at the top.
[01:44:07.145 --> 01:44:13.746]  And so if stuff isn't being visited a lot later, when you try to go to it, it'll be number 587 instead of number 1.
[01:44:14.306 --> 01:44:19.867]  So you've got to, you know, at the bottom of a search, it'll say search 1, search 2, search 3, search 4, search 5, down to search, you know, 100.
[01:44:20.708 --> 01:44:22.788]  You've got to go deeper into search pages.
[01:44:24.088 --> 01:44:24.328]  Uh-huh.
[01:44:24.688 --> 01:44:24.848]  Right.
[01:44:25.028 --> 01:44:26.109]  Hey, listen, good to hear from you.
[01:44:26.129 --> 01:44:27.629]  Keep it up and God bless you, Pam.
[01:44:28.269 --> 01:44:28.589]  You bet.
[01:44:28.689 --> 01:44:30.369]  Barry in Arizona, you're on the air.
[01:44:30.429 --> 01:44:30.769]  Welcome.
[01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:32.710]  Hey, Alex.
[01:44:33.010 --> 01:44:33.270]  Hello.
[01:44:33.973 --> 01:44:35.234]  I just wanted to touch base with you.
[01:44:35.274 --> 01:44:56.053]  I'm doing a special presentation on Saturday 9-11 at my local library and I wanted to get some words of wisdom and some encouragement from you because I'm going to show some video clips from your films and some others and just try to get the community together to really talk about this and get out of their denial man because it's just starting to really... Well I would take the zombie poll and go so half of New Yorkers think the government carried out 9-11
[01:44:57.621 --> 01:45:00.143]  Uh, not just let it happen, but consciously we're involved.
[01:45:00.523 --> 01:45:02.705]  Half of New Yorkers in a Zogby poll.
[01:45:02.925 --> 01:45:04.687]  So I guess half of us are kooks now.
[01:45:06.748 --> 01:45:08.089]  Yeah, you can rank me up there, I guess.
[01:45:08.349 --> 01:45:11.252]  But I mean, see, that's the point, is we are now the majority.
[01:45:11.292 --> 01:45:12.973]  We are going to educate everyone.
[01:45:13.293 --> 01:45:14.214]  It is going to happen.
[01:45:14.878 --> 01:45:15.899]  Well, that's what I'm working on.
[01:45:15.919 --> 01:45:26.564]  You know, you've encouraged me to get out there and try to take a, you know, start being a proactive... Yeah, well, just tell the activist people to come that they want us to all feel like we're alone, and we're the only ones that think the world is round, or that Hitler is bad.
[01:45:26.804 --> 01:45:27.225]  But no!
[01:45:27.525 --> 01:45:28.445]  We are the majority!
[01:45:28.966 --> 01:45:30.186]  Yeah.
[01:45:30.266 --> 01:45:35.629]  One thing I wanted to do, though, was, like, before I even start speaking, you know, I'm anticipating there's going to be a pretty good audience there.
[01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:44.394]  But, you know, I wanted to kind of, you know, say to the audience that any government agents have to declare themselves.
[01:45:45.811 --> 01:45:50.392]  Well, they don't have to and they won't, and I wouldn't scare people.
[01:45:51.172 --> 01:45:59.234]  I would just talk about how we're the majority, we're the good people, we're exposing terrorists.
[01:45:59.414 --> 01:46:03.075]  By the way, there's so many of these 9-11 groups now, they don't have agents to go to all of them.
[01:46:03.795 --> 01:46:05.856]  And most of the agents that go, we're turning them.
[01:46:07.196 --> 01:46:09.897]  I had an experience a long time ago that I wanted to talk to you about.
[01:46:09.997 --> 01:46:11.477]  I got ahold of Udi Ofer at the
[01:46:12.273 --> 01:46:12.693]  I don't know.
[01:46:31.283 --> 01:46:43.753]  Well, you know, I first came up with the idea to have cities and counties throw out the Patriot Act, just like I was imitating Henry Lamb's idea and Michael New's father's idea to have U.N.
[01:46:43.793 --> 01:46:44.333]  free zones.
[01:46:44.373 --> 01:46:49.917]  And I said, we ought to have anti-Patriot Act, pro-Patriot zones.
[01:46:50.958 --> 01:46:54.301]  And I put out an article about it and other people picked up on it.
[01:46:54.321 --> 01:46:57.403]  That just shows how you can come up with a good idea and people will duplicate it.
[01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:12.684]  And so the Civil Liberties Union got involved, and some chapters are good, some are bad, a lot of them are infiltrated, and they kind of watered it down, and they've got it passed, and again, in over 400 cities, four states, last time I checked, mainstream media says 370 now, but it's over 400, I've counted them up.
[01:47:13.325 --> 01:47:18.447]  All I do is count up the ones they've got listed, and then go out and find 50 more that they don't have listed, and no, we're over 400.
[01:47:19.427 --> 01:47:23.949]  But yeah, the civil, for those who don't understand, this is what civil rights is.
[01:47:24.289 --> 01:47:25.830]  Here's a microcosm example.
[01:47:27.486 --> 01:47:48.939]  Until 1868, if you wanted to marry a woman, and if she was of age and she consented, you would go to a pastor, or a rabbi, or whatever, or to a sea captain, whoever could do it, and you would be married.
[01:47:49.579 --> 01:47:50.440]  No state involved.
[01:47:51.212 --> 01:48:00.182]  But when they passed civil rights, this is just a microcosm example, one subsection of that was you've got to get a marriage license, the state has to certify it.
[01:48:00.202 --> 01:48:04.226]  Now, that was under the 13th Amendment.
[01:48:05.817 --> 01:48:07.078]  Excuse me, 14th Amendment.
[01:48:07.499 --> 01:48:10.101]  Which they said, well we can't free all these black people.
[01:48:10.722 --> 01:48:11.963]  Abraham Lincoln said he didn't want to do that.
[01:48:12.063 --> 01:48:13.725]  We'll just make them wards of the state.
[01:48:13.765 --> 01:48:15.526]  But that was really for all citizens as well.
[01:48:15.867 --> 01:48:16.768]  It's bad for anybody.
[01:48:17.148 --> 01:48:25.035]  And so that's an example of what it was, is so black men couldn't marry white women, or so blacks couldn't start families and marry other blacks.
[01:48:25.296 --> 01:48:26.537]  There were articles written about it.
[01:48:26.857 --> 01:48:27.678]  That's what it is.
[01:48:27.918 --> 01:48:29.800]  And so a civil right is a privilege.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.602]  A civil right means you're a ward of Rome.
[01:48:33.683 --> 01:48:35.025]  Rome was under civil law.
[01:48:35.305 --> 01:48:52.341]  They shifted us on to Roman law at that point, away from the Bill of Rights and the common law that was Jewish, and came out of Mosaic law at Mount Sinai, then grew into the Magna Carta 1214 and 1776 with the Declaration of Independence July 4th, and then the
[01:48:54.998 --> 01:49:09.602]  uh... eighty-eight and uh... eighty-nine and all of those movements so for those who don't understand civil versus god-given or human rights uh... that's the difference is that it may be wards of the state.
[01:49:10.963 --> 01:49:13.163]  Can I mention one more thing to you?
[01:49:13.183 --> 01:49:14.724]  Sure.
[01:49:15.104 --> 01:49:21.046]  Concerning the illegal immigration issue, I did some research into the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
[01:49:21.066 --> 01:49:21.726]  Have you read that?
[01:49:22.006 --> 01:49:22.186]  Yes.
[01:49:22.762 --> 01:49:26.506]  Well, that was in there, but this is really part of globalization, the Pan-American Union.
[01:49:26.546 --> 01:49:27.306]  Thank you for the call.
[01:49:42.108 --> 01:49:45.973]  We'll be back and I'll get into the Russia situation and we'll get to more of your calls.
[01:49:46.393 --> 01:49:47.294]  Everybody be patient.
[01:49:47.314 --> 01:49:48.195]  We will get to you.

[01:49:53.743 --> 01:49:55.245]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.445 --> 01:49:58.548]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.668 --> 01:50:02.592]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.632 --> 01:50:06.857]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.197 --> 01:50:10.981]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.101 --> 01:50:12.923]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.523 --> 01:50:16.405]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.445 --> 01:50:21.148]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.328 --> 01:50:24.369]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.549 --> 01:50:27.411]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.891 --> 01:50:34.015]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.555 --> 01:50:38.340]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:53:14.924 --> 01:53:18.865]  Just briefly here, my new film, American Dictators, is out.
[01:53:19.366 --> 01:53:19.986]  It's 90 minutes long.
[01:53:20.006 --> 01:53:20.126]  It's 1995.
[01:53:23.633 --> 01:53:29.682]  It covers the staged election of 2004, Bush, Kerry being cousins, being skull and bones.
[01:53:29.702 --> 01:53:33.187]  We go back to Bohemian Grove, to the gates of Bohemian Grove, interview locals.
[01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:38.915]  The film gets into Nader being controlled as loyal opposition.
[01:53:40.015 --> 01:53:42.818]  It gets into the police state that's unfolding.
[01:53:43.158 --> 01:53:45.680]  It gets into 9-11, some of the newest developments.
[01:53:46.221 --> 01:53:49.824]  Believe me, it's a film you want to have for those that love my films and have gotten the others.
[01:53:50.185 --> 01:53:51.806]  American Dictators, you need to have it.

[01:55:31.425 --> 01:55:32.666]  Ah, Bush, a bisexual.
[01:55:32.686 --> 01:55:33.666]  Hmm, mainstream news.
[01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:35.247]  We'll get into that.
[01:55:35.267 --> 01:55:40.130]  Hey, gotta be into that to be a Christian conservative in the new Antichrist Christianity.
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:45.561]  Terrorists got orders from abroad, did not speak Chechnyan.
[01:55:45.581 --> 01:55:47.882]  This is from the official Russian news agency.
[01:55:48.302 --> 01:55:49.783]  Terrorists have seized a school.
[01:55:51.243 --> 01:55:54.244]  September 1st, we're receiving orders from abroad.
[01:55:54.544 --> 01:56:03.827]  Throughout the three suspense-laden days, it says, Azabak Al-Azazov, President Putin's advisor for Northern Caucasian Affairs.
[01:56:04.682 --> 01:56:08.845]  And it says the men had their conversations not within Russia, but with other countries.
[01:56:09.086 --> 01:56:10.447]  They were led on a leash.
[01:56:11.087 --> 01:56:16.592]  One self-styled friend has been working for several decades, I deem, to dismember Russia.
[01:56:17.132 --> 01:56:21.415]  Yes, Putin has been caught blowing up three of his own buildings, caught planting bombs in the fourth building.
[01:56:21.696 --> 01:56:26.980]  Putin, who has been caught supposedly killing all the terrorists at the theater seats, turned out to be his men inside.
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:28.381]  This is mainstream news, folks.
[01:56:29.884 --> 01:56:32.047]  And with this new one, here's the Irish Examiner.
[01:56:32.468 --> 01:56:35.853]  Local police may have helped terrorists plan Russian siege.
[01:56:36.294 --> 01:56:39.238]  The militants who seized a school in Russia, killing more than 350 people.
[01:56:39.719 --> 01:56:41.862]  Wait, the police said they machine gunned the crowd and did that.
[01:56:42.606 --> 01:56:46.029]  May have had help from local police, an official admitted yesterday.
[01:56:46.069 --> 01:56:53.376]  Meanwhile, the President of Northern Ossetia, a southern province where the hostage drama unfolded, apologized for failing to avert it.
[01:56:53.796 --> 01:56:55.338]  I fully understand my responsibility.
[01:56:55.458 --> 01:57:04.046]  Alexander Dazhagov told doctors and relatives of the wounded children in a hospital in the regional capital, not far from Basina.
[01:57:04.847 --> 01:57:06.568]  Funny that he's apologizing.
[01:57:06.648 --> 01:57:12.751]  Our government gets worship for, quote, letting attacks happen and gets more control and funding and get cash bonuses.
[01:57:13.572 --> 01:57:15.292]  In every other country, they have to apologize.
[01:57:16.253 --> 01:57:22.956]  He says, I want to beg your pardon for failing to protect children, teachers, parents, and the regional leader who looked distressed with tears in his eyes.
[01:57:23.657 --> 01:57:25.518]  Well, you haven't watched the American model, buddy.
[01:57:25.538 --> 01:57:28.099]  You should get a cash bonus and get to take people's freedoms.
[01:57:30.129 --> 01:57:32.230]  Police suspected of complicity in school siege.
[01:57:32.250 --> 01:57:32.970]  Another headline.
[01:57:33.450 --> 01:57:33.951]  Get to that.
[01:57:34.391 --> 01:57:35.051]  Another headline.
[01:57:35.071 --> 01:57:37.092]  Local police may have helped terrorists plan attacks.
[01:57:38.032 --> 01:57:39.133]  There's so much more news.
[01:57:39.173 --> 01:57:40.193]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:40.253 --> 01:57:41.654]  I hope your station carries it.
[01:57:42.714 --> 01:57:45.656]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.591 --> 01:57:52.631]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.352 --> 01:57:54.452]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.112 --> 01:57:55.933]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.693 --> 01:57:57.593]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.274 --> 01:58:01.995]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.435 --> 01:58:06.517]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.852 --> 01:58:21.916]  Alright my friends, now into hour number three of this Wednesday live September 8, 2004 edition as we blast out worldwide on the internet and shortwave and simulcast on wonderful AM and FM affiliates across this nation.
[01:58:23.216 --> 01:58:24.837]  I know we've had callers holding for a long time.
[01:58:24.857 --> 01:58:29.078]  We'll go straight to your calls and I'll get more into the Russian situation and new developments there.
[01:58:30.178 --> 01:58:33.219]  The Kitty Kelly book, bringing up bisexuality and Lord Bush.
[01:58:34.345 --> 01:58:35.366]  Re-entering the Matrix.
[01:58:35.406 --> 01:58:37.788]  The Matrix system is back and no, it's not a movie.
[01:58:38.429 --> 01:58:39.169]  Much, much more.
[01:58:39.209 --> 01:58:41.852]  But first off, let's get five of these callers at least out of the way.
[01:58:42.392 --> 01:58:43.333]  Mike in Michigan.
[01:58:43.353 --> 01:58:44.494]  You're on the air globally.
[01:58:44.534 --> 01:58:44.954]  Go ahead.
[01:58:44.974 --> 01:58:45.935]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:58:46.015 --> 01:58:46.255]  Good.
[01:58:47.536 --> 01:58:54.743]  I know that kind of drifted off that topic, but I'm kind of worried about this whole war games thing.
[01:58:55.183 --> 01:59:02.309]  And I was kind of curious about what you predict the administration is going to do to kind of like, you know, sweep that under the rug.
[01:59:03.351 --> 01:59:18.319]  Well, again, over two years ago, and I put it in a film that was completed two years ago, Masters of Terror, we got the AP reports, you name it, we even had it beforehand, that they ran drills on 9-11 of hijacked jets flying into buildings, and that that was used to have things stand down, and Dick Cheney ran that.
[01:59:18.739 --> 01:59:22.761]  Since then, it's all come out in mainstream news, videos and books are being made about it, and that's good!
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:34.743]  With a Zogby poll of half of New Yorkers thinking the government was behind 9-11, the vast majority, 60-plus percent even, conservative, thinking that they let it happen.
[01:59:35.483 --> 01:59:40.385]  The globalists are in deep trouble, and I think that neutralizes their capacity to carry out terror attacks.
[01:59:40.805 --> 01:59:47.307]  I predicted that during the convention there would not be terror attacks in New York, but they would be in Europe or Russia, and exactly that happened.
[01:59:47.327 --> 01:59:54.129]  So I think they'll do some demonstrations like that to try to scare us, but big events here domestically on the order of 9-11 may be off for now.
[01:59:54.429 --> 01:59:57.411]  They may pull it, though, after the election, or they could do it before.
[01:59:57.431 --> 01:59:58.412]  I don't have a crystal ball.
[01:59:59.132 --> 02:00:10.119]  Well, since all of this is coming to light, and I think it's really kind of sickly ironic that during the same time that they were testing or doing war games to prevent that, you know, it happens.
[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:23.688]  And so I'm hoping that America is going to be like, for irony to occur on that kind of level, you know, hopefully that's going to open eyes too, but I'm almost worried about that catalyzing the martial law agenda because
[02:00:24.324 --> 02:00:25.965]  No, now they're kind of caught with their pants down.
[02:00:26.466 --> 02:00:31.049]  Well, they've already been caught with their pants down a whole bunch, sir, and information is always good.
[02:00:31.449 --> 02:00:32.250]  It's not bad.
[02:00:32.951 --> 02:00:34.172]  They operate in darkness.
[02:00:34.212 --> 02:00:35.533]  They operate covertly.
[02:00:35.853 --> 02:00:37.414]  They cannot stand exposure.
[02:00:39.075 --> 02:00:39.255]  Sure.
[02:00:39.696 --> 02:00:40.817]  Alright, well, thank you very much.
[02:00:41.157 --> 02:00:42.178]  Hey, I appreciate the call, Mike.
[02:00:42.198 --> 02:00:42.898]  Good to hear from you.
[02:00:42.978 --> 02:00:43.659]  Yeah.
[02:00:43.819 --> 02:00:45.560]  Mike in Illinois.
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:46.141]  You're on the air.
[02:00:46.161 --> 02:00:46.521]  Go ahead.
[02:00:47.577 --> 02:00:48.457]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:00:48.617 --> 02:00:48.857]  Good!
[02:00:49.098 --> 02:00:51.078]  Alex, like I said, I've got to thank you again.
[02:00:51.118 --> 02:00:54.039]  I can't thank you enough for going to New York and filming this stuff.
[02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:58.001]  Like I said, I talked to some people I know that were there and it's wonderful.
[02:00:58.401 --> 02:01:05.143]  I want to make you aware of something, Alex, and CNN is garbage on TV, but I just want to make you and your listeners aware.
[02:01:05.203 --> 02:01:09.885]  I don't know if you know this, but on Sunday, September 12th, that's this coming Sunday, at 8 p.m.
[02:01:10.065 --> 02:01:14.527]  Eastern on CNN, they're going to have a special on suitcase nukes.
[02:01:15.047 --> 02:01:16.368]  Yeah, to scare us into submission.
[02:01:16.388 --> 02:01:17.910]  To scare us into submission, absolutely.
[02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:20.012]  And I think it's an hour or two special, I'm not sure.
[02:01:20.252 --> 02:01:22.534]  But I would just kind of impel them to watch it.
[02:01:22.554 --> 02:01:25.977]  Not to be scared, but to watch it to see how they're going to try to spook us into more submission.
[02:01:25.997 --> 02:01:26.657]  Well, I know this.
[02:01:26.717 --> 02:01:29.520]  If a city gets given up your freedom, I'm going to keep you safe.
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:30.901]  Oh, absolutely, Alex.
[02:01:31.101 --> 02:01:32.963]  You know, one thing I want to tell you that really scares me.
[02:01:33.023 --> 02:01:33.924]  I showed your film.
[02:01:34.326 --> 02:01:40.009]  9-11 wrote a tyranny about, oh, I don't know, six months ago to church and I got this guy real involved and interested in you.
[02:01:40.029 --> 02:01:41.290]  He goes to your websites all the time.
[02:01:41.330 --> 02:01:42.630]  He spreads the news out really good.
[02:01:43.651 --> 02:01:50.254]  But one thing he said that he heard from somebody that the government, and I know you know this, Alex, but I want to ask your opinion on it.
[02:01:50.314 --> 02:01:52.696]  They're going to go around and start trying to shut down websites.
[02:01:53.296 --> 02:01:57.338]  And Alex, if that happens, we're going to lose a lot of power in this fight.
[02:01:57.538 --> 02:01:59.099]  Sir, they can't shut them all down.
[02:01:59.139 --> 02:02:00.940]  Everybody needs to start their own websites.
[02:02:01.684 --> 02:02:02.385]  Okay.
[02:02:02.405 --> 02:02:05.811]  And the more they try to censor it, the more people want this information and crave it.
[02:02:06.532 --> 02:02:06.732]  Right.
[02:02:07.013 --> 02:02:10.338]  So even if they do try to start it, other websites will start up, and that's it.
[02:02:10.358 --> 02:02:12.302]  I think it only costs $25 to start your own website.
[02:02:13.752 --> 02:02:15.153]  Well, they're not going to be able to do that.
[02:02:15.173 --> 02:02:16.214]  They're going to try to tax the net.
[02:02:16.234 --> 02:02:17.755]  They're going to try to regulate the net.
[02:02:18.076 --> 02:02:18.296]  Right.
[02:02:18.776 --> 02:02:22.500]  They're coming out with Internet 2, where you have to be a member of a university or government agency.
[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:24.021]  Then that's going to be the new net.
[02:02:24.061 --> 02:02:26.503]  We have to ignore and boycott the new Internet.
[02:02:26.543 --> 02:02:27.264]  The new Internet, right.
[02:02:27.284 --> 02:02:31.267]  Because he said basically, like you said, Alex, anybody who goes against George Bush is considered a terrorist.
[02:02:31.387 --> 02:02:35.050]  And he says anything that's going to be on there that's anti-government, they're going to be considered terrorists.
[02:02:35.070 --> 02:02:36.732]  They're not going to be able to get away with that, sir.
[02:02:37.012 --> 02:02:37.432]  Right, I know.
[02:02:37.452 --> 02:02:39.514]  I mean, they can declare themselves God tomorrow.
[02:02:39.534 --> 02:02:40.555]  They're not going to be able to get away with it.
[02:02:42.165 --> 02:02:42.946]  I appreciate the call.
[02:02:42.986 --> 02:02:43.366]  Take care.
[02:02:43.386 --> 02:02:45.068]  You know, we're in a fight, folks.
[02:02:45.108 --> 02:02:45.728]  Just know that.
[02:02:45.928 --> 02:02:51.994]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[02:02:52.394 --> 02:02:56.478]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[02:02:56.978 --> 02:03:04.185]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[02:03:04.725 --> 02:03:12.070]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[02:03:12.430 --> 02:03:14.652]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[02:03:14.992 --> 02:03:18.254]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[02:03:18.655 --> 02:03:21.797]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[02:03:22.117 --> 02:03:25.019]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[02:03:25.499 --> 02:03:30.624]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match.
[02:03:30.764 --> 02:03:33.726]  Because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[02:03:34.106 --> 02:03:35.608]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings.
[02:03:35.668 --> 02:03:37.409]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[02:03:46.465 --> 02:03:55.527]  Now, you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.787 --> 02:04:07.010]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw, stagnant pond water, into delicious, crystal-clear drinking water.
[02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:13.051]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:13.311 --> 02:04:19.954]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:20.174 --> 02:04:26.976]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:27.256 --> 02:04:29.037]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:04:29.297 --> 02:04:31.358]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:04:31.558 --> 02:04:34.459]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[02:04:34.499 --> 02:04:35.239]  Call New Millennium at 888-
[02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:49.027]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:49.227 --> 02:04:53.630]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:58.173]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[02:04:58.273 --> 02:04:59.594]  A New World Order.
[02:05:00.354 --> 02:05:01.135]  Hannah Murray.
[02:05:01.336 --> 02:05:05.560]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:12.568]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:12.688 --> 02:05:14.691]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:15.051 --> 02:05:25.516]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:25.676 --> 02:05:31.099]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:05:31.559 --> 02:05:34.220]  Visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order.
[02:05:34.300 --> 02:05:35.481]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:35.501 --> 02:05:35.941]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:36.021 --> 02:05:37.782]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:45.898 --> 02:05:51.560]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.641 --> 02:06:07.126]  You've got to realize that the globalists are corrupt, wicked, sadistic, evil control freaks who think they're God and are social Darwinists who believe that we're all a bunch of animals and that they're rightful rulers of us.
[02:06:08.146 --> 02:06:13.788]  And they've got all these well-meaning minions of the military and the police and the government that openly serve them.
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:16.381]  And who think they're doing the right thing?
[02:06:16.401 --> 02:06:23.584]  I mean, police think, because they're given a memo to go out and harass independent media, that it's good to beat people up and arrest them and put them in camps?
[02:06:24.064 --> 02:06:24.845]  I mean, that happened!
[02:06:24.865 --> 02:06:26.666]  You just heard the American Spectator reporter!
[02:06:27.446 --> 02:06:28.566]  How is that America?
[02:06:28.827 --> 02:06:30.427]  How does that protect us from terrorism?
[02:06:30.467 --> 02:06:30.988]  It doesn't!
[02:06:32.068 --> 02:06:33.709]  All over the place we're losing our freedoms.
[02:06:33.729 --> 02:06:40.892]  The government's talking about forced drugging of the population, forcible psychological testing of everyone, take the protesters of the mental institution in New York.
[02:06:40.912 --> 02:06:42.893]  You know, this is the mindset!
[02:06:42.933 --> 02:06:44.354]  It's classical tyranny!
[02:06:45.712 --> 02:06:49.956]  And yes we're in a fight, and yes they got bad things planned, but they'll do it to people that serve them.
[02:06:50.296 --> 02:06:52.078]  Regardless, we've got to fight!
[02:06:52.719 --> 02:06:54.841]  It's our duty, it's our responsibility.
[02:06:57.063 --> 02:06:58.144]  And we're in this fight.
[02:06:58.384 --> 02:07:03.248]  Believe me, they would already be going to the wall with this tyranny if they didn't think we wouldn't buy it.
[02:07:05.490 --> 02:07:10.335]  So they're trying to incrementally beta test it, and the national media didn't cover what happened in New York.
[02:07:11.556 --> 02:07:25.024]  But don't worry, the alternative media is doing that and 38 to 45 percent of Americans have left mainstream news and TV and cable and entertainment and have gone to the internet and alternative news and have gotten involved and are becoming activists.
[02:07:25.925 --> 02:07:34.390]  If half the people in New York believe the government was behind 9-11 and the Zogby Bowl, where is it going to be in six months when those half the people talk to the other half?
[02:07:36.091 --> 02:07:37.772]  Half the conservatives believe it!
[02:07:39.764 --> 02:07:41.445]  The globalists are in deep trouble!
[02:07:42.886 --> 02:07:50.872]  They're down on their knees, they're growling and roaring like a bear who's been wounded in the corner, roaring to intimidate us!
[02:07:52.334 --> 02:07:53.214]  Are they dangerous?
[02:07:53.274 --> 02:07:53.675]  Yes!
[02:07:54.275 --> 02:07:55.176]  Can we beat them?
[02:07:55.236 --> 02:07:55.716]  Yes!
[02:07:57.558 --> 02:07:58.618]  We will defeat them!
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:02.141]  You just gotta commit yourself to something.
[02:08:02.161 --> 02:08:04.323]  It's like skydiving, man.
[02:08:04.343 --> 02:08:05.944]  You just gotta get past the fear and jump out.
[02:08:08.135 --> 02:08:09.136]  Don't you remember growing up?
[02:08:09.296 --> 02:08:10.657]  Men out there will know about this.
[02:08:11.598 --> 02:08:27.148]  Do you remember growing up when the bully, when you were 13, 14, he was 18, he started trying to beat you up, take your lunch money, and you just finally got past your fear, he went ahead and slugged you, and you went ahead and started fighting back, and suddenly he was on the ground with blood spilling out of his head, and you were empowered?
[02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:28.349]  That's an analogy.
[02:08:28.389 --> 02:08:29.590]  I'm not saying violence is good.
[02:08:31.071 --> 02:08:32.672]  Maybe you didn't have those experiences.
[02:08:32.692 --> 02:08:34.934]  I remember having
[02:08:35.788 --> 02:08:37.589]  Four guys in a parking lot attacked me.
[02:08:37.609 --> 02:08:41.130]  Once they started punching me, the fear was gone and I was dealing with them.
[02:08:42.331 --> 02:08:44.812]  It didn't matter if I was bleeding, I was going to make them bleed worse.
[02:08:45.992 --> 02:08:48.273]  It's the same thing with this New World Order and the Info War.
[02:08:48.613 --> 02:08:49.534]  Just get in the fight.
[02:08:49.574 --> 02:08:50.694]  Go ahead and commit to it.
[02:08:51.114 --> 02:08:52.015]  Get involved in it.
[02:08:52.275 --> 02:08:54.356]  Once it starts, you're in it, folks.
[02:08:54.836 --> 02:08:55.456]  You're committed.
[02:08:55.516 --> 02:08:56.076]  You're a man.
[02:08:56.136 --> 02:08:56.716]  You're a woman.
[02:08:56.736 --> 02:08:57.817]  You're part of destiny.
[02:08:58.057 --> 02:08:59.077]  You're part of humanity.
[02:08:59.097 --> 02:09:00.298]  You're on the side of goodness.
[02:09:00.942 --> 02:09:02.703]  You're on the side of Yahweh.
[02:09:03.143 --> 02:09:04.124]  You're fighting evil.
[02:09:04.204 --> 02:09:05.925]  You will truly be alive.
[02:09:06.025 --> 02:09:07.366]  Stop being a slave.
[02:09:07.786 --> 02:09:08.906]  Get past your fear.
[02:09:09.387 --> 02:09:09.887]  Break it.
[02:09:10.367 --> 02:09:11.368]  Break the conditioning.
[02:09:11.568 --> 02:09:12.549]  Commit yourself.
[02:09:12.669 --> 02:09:13.389]  Join us.
[02:09:13.889 --> 02:09:15.970]  Join us in your guts, police.
[02:09:16.191 --> 02:09:17.491]  You want to be real men and women.
[02:09:17.531 --> 02:09:19.632]  You want to join us and you know it in your guts.
[02:09:19.873 --> 02:09:22.834]  That hair on the back of your neck standing up, you know it's all true.
[02:09:23.154 --> 02:09:23.635]  Join us.
[02:09:24.435 --> 02:09:25.576]  Join humanity!
[02:09:25.996 --> 02:09:28.679]  Join those that are fighting the dehumanization!
[02:09:28.979 --> 02:09:36.345]  Join those in the spirit of our founding fathers and those that fought tyranny and Moses leaving Egypt!
[02:09:36.745 --> 02:09:39.948]  Join the people who are the renegades against evil!
[02:09:40.628 --> 02:09:42.149]  Stand up against Rome!
[02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:44.812]  Stand up against the New World Order!
[02:09:49.035 --> 02:09:49.856]  Join us!
[02:09:51.408 --> 02:09:58.118]  If you love your family, if you love truth, if you love honor, if you love decency, break your conditioning!
[02:09:58.178 --> 02:09:59.720]  I gotta go quickly now because I want to get to the news.
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:01.523]  Regina in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[02:10:02.094 --> 02:10:04.917]  Okay, Alex, thanks for getting home and thanks for all you do.
[02:10:04.997 --> 02:10:06.999]  I wanted to mention... All the thanks should go to God.
[02:10:07.039 --> 02:10:08.540]  We were truly protected there.
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:17.688]  Well, I'm just, you know, I mean, you're willing... People were being arrested to my left, mainstream cameraman being beat up to my right, and they just broke like the sea around us.
[02:10:17.988 --> 02:10:19.109]  Well, praise God.
[02:10:19.230 --> 02:10:22.993]  I agree with that, Alex, but you go out and step through it, so I appreciate that.
[02:10:23.573 --> 02:10:27.377]  I want to mention today another person, a true patriot, trying to help us here.
[02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:30.352]  We've been bringing up the Freedom Health Initiative.
[02:10:30.372 --> 02:10:33.654]  The Freedom Initiative is forced drugging, mental health, screening.
[02:10:33.954 --> 02:10:38.857]  Yeah, Cochran Breeding, by the way, has come up with a plan and a form for parents to get out of that.
[02:10:39.358 --> 02:10:42.120]  And the new Freedom Initiative, we're going to be having him on in the next few days.
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:48.344]  Okay, but Ron Paul, right now, he will have it up whenever it comes up today or possibly early Thursday.
[02:10:48.804 --> 02:10:52.787]  He wants us to please ask our Congressman to support the Paul Amendment.
[02:10:53.393 --> 02:10:57.335]  To the Labor HHS and Education Appropriations Act for 2005.
[02:10:57.776 --> 02:11:00.157]  Say it a little bit slower so I can write it down.
[02:11:00.177 --> 02:11:01.458]  Small amendment.
[02:11:02.438 --> 02:11:04.720]  To the Labor HHS.
[02:11:05.961 --> 02:11:06.581]  HHS?
[02:11:07.101 --> 02:11:09.123]  HHS, you know, Human Health and Services.
[02:11:09.263 --> 02:11:10.643]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:11:10.703 --> 02:11:13.925]  And Education Appropriations Act for 2005.
[02:11:14.526 --> 02:11:16.727]  And what it requires.
[02:11:16.767 --> 02:11:18.008]  What's the bill number on that?
[02:11:20.636 --> 02:11:21.576]  I didn't get a bill number.
[02:11:21.596 --> 02:11:23.697]  I talked to Paul's office and I had an e-mail.
[02:11:23.737 --> 02:11:26.537]  I tried to e-mail it to you, but it seemed to keep rejecting back.
[02:11:26.557 --> 02:11:28.378]  Yeah, I had a server problem last week.
[02:11:28.398 --> 02:11:29.538]  We were shifting servers.
[02:11:29.658 --> 02:11:30.358]  I'll send it again.
[02:11:30.898 --> 02:11:34.699]  www.thelibertycommittee.org will have it up if you want to do more.
[02:11:34.719 --> 02:11:35.559]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:11:35.679 --> 02:11:38.000]  Are you saying you just had an e-mail bounce today?
[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:43.661]  Yeah, I had trouble getting it to you on both e-mails.
[02:11:44.041 --> 02:11:47.202]  Okay, what it is here, but we need this quick call anyways.
[02:11:47.282 --> 02:11:49.322]  Withhold funds for the new Freedom
[02:11:49.858 --> 02:11:50.719]  We're good to go.
[02:12:06.463 --> 02:12:10.484]  Uh, we'll be involved with forced drugging of children, even though the parents have refused.
[02:12:10.664 --> 02:12:10.924]  Yes.
[02:12:11.244 --> 02:12:12.524]  Uh, and so it's very critical.
[02:12:12.544 --> 02:12:15.225]  Forced drugging is going to be just like vaccines.
[02:12:15.585 --> 02:12:23.087]  But we can get the funding stopped and get, you know, get them to support the, uh, Paul Amendment, uh, to this labor, HHS, and education.
[02:12:23.107 --> 02:12:27.108]  I mean, make these people aware of what they're allowing to happen in this country.
[02:12:27.128 --> 02:12:28.168]  No, that's good news.
[02:12:28.388 --> 02:12:30.688]  That's very, very important, and I'm going to get Ron Paul on.
[02:12:30.708 --> 02:12:32.869]  I'm going to tell my producer to get Ron Paul on.
[02:12:32.889 --> 02:12:33.429]  Thanks for the call.
[02:12:34.252 --> 02:12:35.053]  I'm writing that note.
[02:12:35.133 --> 02:12:37.935]  Get Ron Paul on immediately.
[02:12:38.776 --> 02:12:41.118]  Let us now talk to Brian in Colorado.
[02:12:41.138 --> 02:12:41.878]  Brian, go ahead.
[02:12:41.898 --> 02:12:44.841]  Hello, Brian.
[02:12:44.921 --> 02:12:45.201]  Yeah.
[02:12:46.242 --> 02:12:55.769]  Alex, I was just wondering if you were able to look into who pressured Radio Colorado Network to remove your program from the air?
[02:12:56.970 --> 02:12:58.431]  What, is the show totally off there?
[02:12:58.712 --> 02:12:58.912]  Yes.
[02:13:00.527 --> 02:13:11.050]  I know that the big money people came and offered to buy the time, to pay to get us off, and I know that that was in the process, but we've still got a couple of affiliates.
[02:13:11.070 --> 02:13:13.431]  What's the big one that covers like half the state?
[02:13:13.491 --> 02:13:15.091]  The American Freedom Network?
[02:13:15.131 --> 02:13:15.912]  What's that frequency?
[02:13:17.492 --> 02:13:20.253]  Hey, I'll tell you what, look that up on the website for me, John.
[02:13:20.313 --> 02:13:23.974]  I want to give folks that quadrant.
[02:13:24.014 --> 02:13:26.015]  When did the Colorado Network do that?
[02:13:26.655 --> 02:13:27.135]  Yesterday.
[02:13:27.958 --> 02:13:32.139]  Yeah, well, for every affiliate we lose, two more doors open and we get two more.
[02:13:32.159 --> 02:13:33.320]  We've been getting a lot of new affiliates.
[02:13:33.340 --> 02:13:38.721]  We've been on there, though, about two years and big money came along and paid to have us taken off.
[02:13:38.781 --> 02:13:39.702]  I knew that was in the works.
[02:13:42.603 --> 02:13:46.204]  Do you think they wanted me on and Colorado Springs where North Com's located?
[02:13:48.845 --> 02:13:53.506]  Yeah, I mean, you know, what do you do when people come with money and say, we will pay you to take him off?
[02:13:55.071 --> 02:13:56.292]  Yeah, I suppose so.
[02:13:56.332 --> 02:13:58.113]  Well, you've still got a couple of great affiliates.
[02:13:58.213 --> 02:14:00.374]  One of them is real big and covers like half the state.
[02:14:00.394 --> 02:14:02.195]  It even goes into the state north of Colorado.
[02:14:03.056 --> 02:14:05.077]  And I'll give you that frequency here in a minute.
[02:14:05.097 --> 02:14:06.578]  I can't remember it off the top of my mind.
[02:14:07.338 --> 02:14:11.260]  Yeah, I'd like your shortwave location too.
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:13.181]  94.75, 11 to 2 during the day.
[02:14:13.682 --> 02:14:15.262]  Central and 32.10 at night.
[02:14:15.282 --> 02:14:17.023]  9 to midnight.
[02:14:17.784 --> 02:14:18.464]  Okay.
[02:14:20.525 --> 02:14:21.206]  Alright.
[02:14:21.586 --> 02:14:22.567]  I appreciate that.
[02:14:22.887 --> 02:14:23.247]  You bet.
[02:14:24.767 --> 02:14:26.809]  Yeah, it's just, you know, classical, sir.
[02:14:26.869 --> 02:14:31.132]  I mean, we've probably had a hundred affiliates I've been on over the years bought.
[02:14:31.232 --> 02:14:45.182]  They just flat out, it's kind of a going joke with program directors or owners, put me on for a year, I'll get you the ratings, and then Clear Channel or somebody will come along, or Infinity and buy the station for three times what it's worth, just to shut me up.
[02:14:47.964 --> 02:14:48.605]  Anything else, sir?
[02:14:49.182 --> 02:14:49.863]  Oh, that'll do it.
[02:14:50.563 --> 02:14:52.765]  Okay, let me ask John.
[02:14:52.845 --> 02:14:55.467]  John, did you look at the affiliate list of GCNlive.com?
[02:14:56.588 --> 02:15:03.393]  And tell me what the Colorado Radio Network, because it's a network too, but they carry us, what their flagship station is there in Denver?
[02:15:04.314 --> 02:15:05.134]  The frequency?
[02:15:05.835 --> 02:15:06.756]  It's 13-something.
[02:15:06.836 --> 02:15:08.037]  Forgive me if I'm doing that wrong.
[02:15:08.877 --> 02:15:13.221]  But luckily, most of the big cities that we already covered were covered there.
[02:15:13.501 --> 02:15:16.183]  And they were angry about that station a year ago picking us up.
[02:15:17.550 --> 02:15:21.512]  And they were angry that I kept plugging the Colorado Radio Network.
[02:15:21.552 --> 02:15:22.193]  That was one thing.
[02:15:22.253 --> 02:15:24.214]  I think the Colorado Radio Network is a lot better.
[02:15:25.255 --> 02:15:26.816]  I mean, I think that the... What's wrong with me?
[02:15:27.916 --> 02:15:32.019]  I think that the American Freedom Network is a lot better than the Colorado Radio Network.
[02:15:32.579 --> 02:15:40.004]  And they were getting mad at me that I kept plugging the American Freedom Network on my show because they see that one station as a competing station.
[02:15:40.044 --> 02:15:42.686]  So we're very thankful to have that big affiliate in Colorado.
[02:15:43.006 --> 02:15:45.628]  All of our affiliates are very, very special.
[02:15:46.852 --> 02:15:47.832]  Did you find that yet, John?
[02:15:47.852 --> 02:15:50.794]  It's in the affiliates of GCNlive.com?
[02:15:51.634 --> 02:15:52.194]  Okay, thanks.
[02:15:52.894 --> 02:15:54.115]  Let's take another call here.
[02:15:54.175 --> 02:15:56.036]  Let's talk to Steve in Colorado.
[02:15:56.076 --> 02:15:56.776]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:15:58.097 --> 02:15:59.457]  Yeah, hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:15:59.617 --> 02:15:59.877]  Good!
[02:16:00.197 --> 02:16:10.341]  Hey, I'm down here in Colorado Springs and I hadn't listened on the radio today, so I guess I'm just calling in.
[02:16:11.622 --> 02:16:16.464]  I guess it's kind of a surprise because they had narrowed you down to one hour, the second hour.
[02:16:17.037 --> 02:16:20.198]  On the radio station, the local one here that was an affiliate.
[02:16:20.599 --> 02:16:21.859]  Yeah, you need to call them though.
[02:16:21.879 --> 02:16:23.520]  It won't do anything talking about it on air.
[02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:25.180]  Right, okay.
[02:16:25.461 --> 02:16:26.181]  Have you called them?
[02:16:26.621 --> 02:16:27.241]  No, I haven't.
[02:16:27.261 --> 02:16:29.162]  I just found out about it from the last caller.
[02:16:29.902 --> 02:16:32.683]  So, um, that it was, that you were totally booted off.
[02:16:33.304 --> 02:16:42.227]  So, anyway, what I was mainly calling about was the... Well, you know, every once in a while, though, they air NASCAR or some sporting event.
[02:16:42.528 --> 02:16:45.929]  Right, yeah, they're a big NASCAR... Okay, well then we may not be booted off of there.
[02:16:46.756 --> 02:16:46.996]  Okay.
[02:16:47.016 --> 02:16:47.317]  I don't know.
[02:16:47.337 --> 02:16:48.477]  We need to call them first.
[02:16:49.118 --> 02:16:49.999]  Okay.
[02:16:50.039 --> 02:16:51.080]  What else is on your mind, sir?
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:58.766]  Well, it was about Ron Paul's column for this week, or his Texas Straight Talk, as it's called.
[02:16:58.846 --> 02:16:59.626]  Yes.
[02:17:00.107 --> 02:17:15.759]  And you've probably already aired this, but he had mentioned on this little editorial that he runs every week about how the 9-11 Commission, the CFR-controlled 9-11 Commission, of course, had recommended internal checkpoints.
[02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:20.933]  Yeah, internal checkpoints, a national ID card, a domestic CIA.
[02:17:21.513 --> 02:17:32.763]  Yeah, and so, uh, I guess if people can't see that, uh, we're in the, uh, stages of 1930s Germany, uh, you know, it's like, boy, we're up the creek.
[02:17:32.843 --> 02:17:39.508]  But, uh, anyway, I was wondering, um, if I could give the, uh, 888 number to... Yeah, give that number out for Ron Paul.
[02:17:39.668 --> 02:17:42.891]  Okay, this is Ron Paul's editorial... Okay, we're out of time, you'll have to stay there.
[02:17:46.053 --> 02:17:48.936]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:17:49.276 --> 02:17:52.159]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:17:52.379 --> 02:17:58.584]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:18:48.969 --> 02:18:58.534]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:18:59.614 --> 02:19:09.160]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:19:10.181 --> 02:19:15.685]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[02:20:52.118 --> 02:20:52.939]  Read the labels.
[02:20:53.359 --> 02:20:57.462]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:57.702 --> 02:21:01.885]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.

[02:21:57.822 --> 02:21:58.963]  That we've got left here.
[02:21:59.043 --> 02:22:04.508]  If you do want to call Ron Paul's Legislative Update phone line, it'll just give you a three or four minute recording.

[02:22:08.111 --> 02:22:12.695]  Or he's got his Liberty Committee online too that has his weekly Texas Straight Talk.
[02:22:12.715 --> 02:22:14.056]  We're going to be getting Ron Paul on.
[02:22:14.417 --> 02:22:15.478]  We have him on every few months.
[02:22:15.538 --> 02:22:16.639]  It's time to do that again.
[02:22:17.439 --> 02:22:21.323]  But I want to go ahead and plunge into a bunch of other news right now.
[02:22:21.383 --> 02:22:24.666]  We might even air that Ron Paul piece coming up here.
[02:22:25.547 --> 02:22:29.328]  In just a few minutes, coming up in the next segment.
[02:22:29.868 --> 02:22:31.409]  Let me go ahead now and get into the news.
[02:22:32.109 --> 02:22:33.929]  Very important news we need to cover.
[02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:37.990]  Hurricane Ivan threatens Caribbean islands.
[02:22:38.791 --> 02:22:40.831]  This is out of the Insurance Journal.
[02:22:41.211 --> 02:22:50.674]  Miami's National Hurricane Center warned that Ivan is a dangerous hurricane and is becoming better organized as it rapidly approaches the windward islands, triggering hurricane warnings.
[02:22:51.241 --> 02:22:54.286]  So now, they may have their third hurricane hit Florida.
[02:22:54.386 --> 02:22:55.769]  Boy, that's horrible.
[02:22:56.490 --> 02:22:58.713]  The last one, $15 to $20 billion in damage.
[02:22:59.535 --> 02:23:01.318]  This is out of FCW.com.
[02:23:02.876 --> 02:23:07.699]  Re-enter the Matrix, a multi-state anti-terrorism project regroups after early missteps.
[02:23:07.739 --> 02:23:08.620]  They call it missteps.
[02:23:09.140 --> 02:23:14.964]  Every personal data, everything you buy from a big company, being put in the database, tracking you, nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:23:15.284 --> 02:23:28.353]  When law enforcement officials from several states got together for September 11th, it was set up before that by the way, terrorist attacks and decided they needed to improve the way they shared information, they came up with the Multi-Anti-Terrorism Information Exchanger Matrix System.
[02:23:29.554 --> 02:23:31.797]  It seemed like a great idea as a technology project.
[02:23:31.837 --> 02:23:32.958]  Most believe it still is.
[02:23:33.459 --> 02:23:39.246]  It has moved what was a time-consuming method of tracking investigative leads by tracking everyone, yes.
[02:23:40.527 --> 02:23:49.658]  Making phone calls or sending faxes to people in other states and waiting hours and days for a reply in the 21st century world of electronic networks and automated database queries.
[02:23:51.661 --> 02:23:59.665]  And it says, uh, what the law enforcement and professionals who put Matrix together did not bargain for was the ensuing uproar over privacy concerns and accusations of government big brother.
[02:24:01.066 --> 02:24:07.909]  And then it goes on to, uh, say that, um, they're gonna go ahead and spy on everything you do and Matrix is back.
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:16.004]  Continuing with these articles, Cheney warns against vote for Kerry, Associated Press.
[02:24:16.444 --> 02:24:27.110]  Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday warned Americans about voting for Democratic Senator John Kerry, saying that if the nation makes the wrong choice, on election day it faces the threat of another terrorist attack.
[02:24:27.671 --> 02:24:29.572]  Is that a threat from the terrorists, Cheney?
[02:24:29.632 --> 02:24:30.632]  I think you can speak for them.
[02:24:32.133 --> 02:24:33.354]  Very, very interesting.
[02:24:33.394 --> 02:24:36.996]  Here's one about Kerry, their cousin, their tomb member.
[02:24:38.283 --> 02:24:41.526]  Kerry co-sponsored bill banning gun he waves.
[02:24:42.106 --> 02:24:48.992]  Was Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry seen this weekend waving a gun which would have been banned if legislation he co-sponsored became law?
[02:24:49.392 --> 02:25:00.101]  Kerry co-sponsored S1432 last year, the Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2003, which would have banned a semi-automatic shotgun that has a pistol grip.
[02:25:00.881 --> 02:25:03.924]  But there is Kerry with that very shotgun.
[02:25:04.671 --> 02:25:12.215]  Opponents of the Bill successfully argued how nearly all guns have pistol grips, including millions of Browning Auto 5 shotguns produced since 1903.
[02:25:12.995 --> 02:25:16.437]  Photo show carries hand resting on the pistol grip.
[02:25:17.137 --> 02:25:28.503]  As loosely defined Bill Section 2HII and B44, the term pistol grip means a grip, a thumb piece stock, or any other characteristic that can function as a grip.
[02:25:30.191 --> 02:25:37.020]  And he says, I thank you for this great gift, but I can't take it to the debate with me, Kerry told the cheering crowd as he held up the device.
[02:25:37.881 --> 02:25:38.082]  Hmm.
[02:25:39.123 --> 02:25:41.326]  But Kerry's gun bill would have banned the gift.
[02:25:42.567 --> 02:25:45.872]  And banned the gift as a transaction that would have been a felony for him.
[02:25:47.648 --> 02:26:00.632]  By the way, states that have passed laws against gun bazaars run BATF and locally funded BATF stings where cops will come over to your house posing with one of your neighbors and get you to buy a gun.
[02:26:00.692 --> 02:26:05.854]  If two or more people are in the room, three or more, excuse me, you get a felony charge.
[02:26:07.091 --> 02:26:08.312]  So arrest Kerry.
[02:26:08.712 --> 02:26:11.394]  In fact, check and see if that state he was in has that law.
[02:26:11.414 --> 02:26:12.255]  Call for his arrest.
[02:26:12.755 --> 02:26:14.676]  And call for Limbaugh's arrest for Oxycontin.
[02:26:14.936 --> 02:26:16.918]  And call for Bush's arrest for cocaine.
[02:26:17.278 --> 02:26:18.479]  I'm tired of these hypocrites.
[02:26:18.999 --> 02:26:19.599]  Disgusting.
[02:26:22.461 --> 02:26:24.483]  We'll get to Saddam's generals working as U.S.
[02:26:24.523 --> 02:26:28.365]  military consultants here in just a few minutes.
[02:26:29.186 --> 02:26:32.208]  And Bush short on guard duty and that re-emerging story.
[02:26:32.228 --> 02:26:33.409]  But let's cover this first.
[02:26:33.869 --> 02:26:35.150]  This is from Skolnick's report.
[02:26:36.010 --> 02:26:39.250]  Who has been documenting for years that Bush is bisexual.
[02:26:41.031 --> 02:26:42.972]  Which, you know, I'm a Christian conservative, folks.
[02:26:43.012 --> 02:26:43.913]  You've got to be into that.
[02:26:43.933 --> 02:26:46.935]  You've got to bus in male prostitutes to Bohemian Grove to be a real Christian.
[02:26:47.375 --> 02:26:48.996]  I'm against that, so I guess I'm not a Christian.
[02:26:49.516 --> 02:26:53.598]  Bush's bisexuality asserted in scorching new book update.
[02:26:53.638 --> 02:26:55.980]  New book further confirms our independent investigations.
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:03.044]  Just published, The Family, the real story of the Bush dynasty by veteran, highly controversial author Kitty Kelly.
[02:27:03.064 --> 02:27:09.948]  According to book industry sources, the publisher intends to issue a market one million copies of the book that is the lowdown of the Bushies.
[02:27:10.652 --> 02:27:22.222]  The book details a number of stories long since posted and archived and publicly discussed by us at Skolnick's Report, including stories of co-authored by Sherman Skolnick and Lenny Bloom and their news agency.
[02:27:23.023 --> 02:27:28.308]  And we'll get to this, uh, pretty telly, getting into the bisexuality of Lord Bush.
[02:27:29.709 --> 02:27:30.370]  Well, what's wrong?
[02:27:30.390 --> 02:27:32.251]  I mean, Arnold poses for those magazines.
[02:27:32.271 --> 02:27:33.853]  That's part of the Christian conservatism.
[02:27:36.104 --> 02:27:39.126]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.046 --> 02:27:42.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.890 --> 02:27:48.371]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:27:48.591 --> 02:27:55.935]  Jerry Guinetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:27:56.235 --> 02:28:00.658]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:28:00.918 --> 02:28:03.199]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste.
[02:28:03.459 --> 02:28:10.766]  Big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:28:10.786 --> 02:28:15.171]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:28:15.511 --> 02:28:17.994]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:28:18.014 --> 02:28:24.180]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:26.082]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:28:26.282 --> 02:28:27.163]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:28:27.244 --> 02:28:30.247]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.

[02:28:41.241 --> 02:28:42.163]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:28:46.129 --> 02:28:52.374]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:52.514 --> 02:28:58.680]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has 8 LED lamps.
[02:28:58.940 --> 02:29:07.387]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.647 --> 02:29:14.653]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.953 --> 02:29:19.776]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.996 --> 02:29:25.400]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:28.842]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:29.163 --> 02:29:37.108]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:46.134 --> 02:29:50.497]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[02:29:50.657 --> 02:29:57.701]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[02:29:58.001 --> 02:30:04.886]  Membership in the bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[02:30:05.206 --> 02:30:12.713]  The Silver Bear Cafe provides you with an income opportunity that will provide you and your family with an ongoing revenue stream in return for simply spreading the message.
[02:30:13.093 --> 02:30:19.039]  So many of you have been trying to get the message out individually, but collectively our voices are strong and cannot be silenced.
[02:30:19.479 --> 02:30:28.508]  Membership in the bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom, how the runaway government is crushing the American dream, why wars are played out across the globe, the fractional reserve system, etc.
[02:30:29.048 --> 02:30:31.692]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourself.
[02:30:32.032 --> 02:30:33.134]  Knowledge is power.

[02:31:12.768 --> 02:31:23.191]  So, in this article, it gets, in Kitty Kelly's book, gets into, uh, well, does Bush have boyfriends?
[02:31:24.972 --> 02:31:29.674]  And I can't tell you folks, I mean, how many governors we've become aware of, involved in all this.
[02:31:29.794 --> 02:31:33.295]  And this is another way of controlling them, another way of having dirt on them.
[02:31:33.455 --> 02:31:38.396]  It's, uh, we'll get more into that in a few minutes and then get back into all this other news.
[02:31:38.456 --> 02:31:39.797]  Right now, let's go ahead.
[02:31:40.826 --> 02:31:43.087]  Number one, did we get that Ron Paul clip ready?
[02:31:44.728 --> 02:31:46.529]  Great, we're going to play that here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:48.250 --> 02:31:51.031]  But first we're going to talk to Debbie Morrow at New Millennium Concepts.
[02:31:51.832 --> 02:31:53.092]  Time to stop drinking the water.
[02:31:53.192 --> 02:31:54.433]  Take control at least of that.
[02:31:54.813 --> 02:31:56.214]  The poison they're putting in your water.
[02:31:56.574 --> 02:31:58.095]  I drank some of the tap water in New York.
[02:31:58.115 --> 02:31:59.375]  It tasted like kerosene.
[02:32:00.656 --> 02:32:02.977]  Why anybody would drink the stuff they're putting in the water.
[02:32:03.277 --> 02:32:06.239]  The herbicides, the pesticides, the fluoride, the mercury.
[02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:07.480]  The arsenic.
[02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:08.221]  I have no idea.
[02:32:08.241 --> 02:32:10.622]  These are the highest quality filters made in America.
[02:32:10.642 --> 02:32:13.223]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[02:32:13.463 --> 02:32:14.264]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:32:14.404 --> 02:32:15.284]  Good to be here.
[02:32:15.625 --> 02:32:16.065]  You bet.
[02:32:16.185 --> 02:32:17.025]  I was gone last week.
[02:32:17.045 --> 02:32:18.246]  Didn't get a chance to talk to you.
[02:32:18.286 --> 02:32:20.787]  Tell folks about the Berkey water filters and why folks need them.
[02:32:21.628 --> 02:32:29.592]  Well, the Berkey water filters are a new state-of-the-art water filter that we specifically have made here in America.
[02:32:30.599 --> 02:32:58.549]  There are other gravity water filters available, but the new Berkey Light actually set a new standard for the water filter industry in gravity water filters because the Berkey Light black Berkey purification elements actually take out the pathogenic bacteria, triomethanes, radiologicals, inorganic minerals, and volatile organic compounds to below detectable levels.
[02:32:59.475 --> 02:33:00.416]  Thank you so much.
[02:33:12.029 --> 02:33:16.631]  No chlorine at all, no azirazine, no benzene, no MTBE.
[02:33:16.871 --> 02:33:18.552]  It's completely rid of it.
[02:33:18.792 --> 02:33:24.274]  And you had a special a month ago in the last hurricane hit where you would give overnight delivery for only $18.
[02:33:24.314 --> 02:33:30.597]  We're still offering that along with the two free gifts they get with the Berkey Light.
[02:33:30.637 --> 02:33:37.300]  Even though that actually cost you what like $58-$60 to send that overnight, folks need to take advantage of that.
[02:33:37.885 --> 02:33:56.849]  Yes, they do and you have to realize, you know, I have relatives in Melbourne and I was able to finally get through to them yesterday and they said that the biggest hardship that they're having is no electricity and they're not sure they do have running water but they don't know if it's clean or not because of the flooding and things.
[02:33:56.989 --> 02:33:58.249]  Do they have big murkies?
[02:33:58.309 --> 02:34:00.030]  Yep, yep, yep, they sure do!
[02:34:02.050 --> 02:34:17.715]  So thank goodness, you know, so, you know, we want to go ahead and be sure that people are prepared for any situation, whether or not it's a hurricane or a natural disaster or just everyday life, because everyday life
[02:34:19.210 --> 02:34:21.693]  Is what you're most concerned with at this point right now?
[02:34:36.730 --> 02:34:38.311]  Made right here in America, folks.
[02:34:38.371 --> 02:34:39.392]  Give Debbie a call.
[02:34:39.772 --> 02:34:41.273]  If the phone's busy, leave your name and number.
[02:34:41.293 --> 02:34:43.274]  She'll call you right back.
[02:34:43.294 --> 02:34:43.774]  1-888-803-4888.
[02:34:43.874 --> 02:34:47.317]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:34:47.497 --> 02:34:49.878]  Or Berkeywater.com.
[02:34:49.918 --> 02:34:59.484]  And in the comments section, tell them it's the Alex Jones Special and tell them if it's the $199 Berkey light system without the lighting system in it, tell them which free gift you want.
[02:34:59.544 --> 02:35:00.584]  A sport Berkey that does $600
[02:35:02.173 --> 02:35:02.653]  We're good to go!
[02:35:26.821 --> 02:35:28.963]  Well, then you can get two free gifts.
[02:35:29.624 --> 02:35:34.068]  You can also get overnight shipping for the normal price of UPS Ground.
[02:35:34.428 --> 02:35:40.574]  That's a $40 savings right there.
[02:35:40.594 --> 02:35:41.195]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:35:41.235 --> 02:35:41.995]  Anything else, Debbie?
[02:35:42.596 --> 02:35:47.721]  No, but I did want to remind people that we do have the Berkey Sport Bottle Special where they can get
[02:35:48.337 --> 02:35:48.837]  I don't know.
[02:36:02.313 --> 02:36:06.395]  Out at the schools using water fountains and things like that.
[02:36:06.435 --> 02:36:12.238]  I cannot emphasize how important it would be to send a Berkey filtered sport bottle to school.
[02:36:12.278 --> 02:36:24.684]  Yeah, if you don't want your children being force fed the drugs that are in the water, literally, this is the force drugging right there, give them one of these $20 filters that cost you $35 at a store, high quality.
[02:36:25.004 --> 02:36:26.625]  It will do 600 plus refills.
[02:36:26.865 --> 02:36:28.746]  That will cover the whole school year, folks.
[02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:32.440]  Anyway, so that's it.
[02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:35.481]  I look forward to talking to the people that call in.
[02:36:36.142 --> 02:36:37.902]  And Alex, keep up the good work.
[02:36:37.982 --> 02:36:39.243]  We missed you last week.
[02:36:40.023 --> 02:36:41.504]  Well, thank God we got back safe.
[02:36:41.544 --> 02:36:42.224]  And thank you, Debbie.
[02:36:42.244 --> 02:36:42.684]  Take care.
[02:36:42.904 --> 02:36:43.444]  You're welcome.
[02:36:43.524 --> 02:36:43.764]  Bye-bye.
[02:36:43.784 --> 02:36:44.445]  Again, you bet.
[02:36:44.505 --> 02:36:45.325]  That number is 888-803-4438.
[02:36:45.625 --> 02:36:55.929]  One other item here, and then I'm going to just plunge into a news blitz for the last 20 minutes of the broadcast here.
[02:36:55.969 --> 02:36:57.109]  Let me get my press release.
[02:36:57.129 --> 02:36:59.870]  This is on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:37:01.195 --> 02:37:05.876]  Corporate takeover of Birthplace of Access Television reaching critical juncture.
[02:37:05.896 --> 02:37:07.757]  There is a very important meeting on Wednesday.
[02:37:07.797 --> 02:37:08.437]  That's tonight.
[02:37:08.837 --> 02:37:11.958]  It's a joint meeting of the Music Commission and Telecommunications Commission.
[02:37:11.998 --> 02:37:13.978]  September 8th at 6.30 p.m.
[02:37:14.038 --> 02:37:18.360]  at 1 Texas Center, 505 Barton Springs Road, room 325.
[02:37:19.500 --> 02:37:23.101]  Lovers of free speech, it is imperative that you attend this Wednesday night meeting.
[02:37:23.461 --> 02:37:27.542]  It will be a joint meeting between the City, Telecommunications Commission, three City Council members,
[02:37:27.822 --> 02:37:33.724]  And the Austin Music Commission, they are going to try and certify a plan to take over AXS Television at this confab.
[02:37:35.025 --> 02:37:37.906]  We have a link to the city agenda there in the press release.
[02:37:38.046 --> 02:37:41.787]  We have a link to the statesman last week admitting that they're going to take over free speech.
[02:37:41.847 --> 02:37:42.627]  It's now admitted.
[02:37:43.788 --> 02:37:44.828]  This is massive.
[02:37:45.368 --> 02:37:47.789]  Please, please, please.
[02:37:49.970 --> 02:38:01.216]  Go to Infowars.com, get this press release, link through to the city website above, go to the emails of city officials, send them this press release, help us, be our muscle, our backbone.
[02:38:01.236 --> 02:38:05.418]  I want each one of the city council members to get at least 20 copies of this in their email box.
[02:38:06.819 --> 02:38:18.446]  I will be there tonight, 630 folks, be there sharp to sign up to speak or to give me or others your time to speak so we get more time to do a presentation, tell them how dare them, stand up against what's happening,
[02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:26.549]  It's at 1 Texas Center, 505 Barton Springs Road, room 325.
[02:38:27.631 --> 02:38:30.134]  It's over in a 10 story building.
[02:38:30.154 --> 02:38:31.536]  I don't remember how many stories.
[02:38:31.556 --> 02:38:37.624]  It's a city building right behind Threadgill's on Barton Springs Road in downtown Austin on the south side of the river.
[02:38:38.576 --> 02:38:40.858]  And it says One Texas Center on a big old building.
[02:38:40.878 --> 02:38:41.558]  You can't miss it.
[02:38:42.719 --> 02:38:43.960]  505 Barton Springs Road, room 325.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.904]  And if you get there at 625, there'll be lots of people going in the front door.
[02:38:48.944 --> 02:38:51.046]  You can follow them up to room 325.
[02:38:51.846 --> 02:38:52.887]  It's a big conference room.
[02:38:52.927 --> 02:38:55.769]  Kind of hard for me to find last time, but we did find it.
[02:38:55.829 --> 02:38:56.030]  Room 325.
[02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:59.032]  Want to see everybody there today.
[02:38:59.292 --> 02:39:00.373]  It's not at the City Hall.
[02:39:00.453 --> 02:39:05.497]  It's at room 325 of One Texas Center, 505 Barton Springs Road.
[02:39:07.754 --> 02:39:15.605]  And so that's really, really important to see everybody out there, especially musicians and others, because they're trying to claim, well, musicians need channels.
[02:39:15.645 --> 02:39:16.626]  Let us take over your channels.
[02:39:16.927 --> 02:39:18.849]  Musicians can already go on AXIS Television.
[02:39:19.130 --> 02:39:21.292]  It's harder to go through the Austin Music Network.
[02:39:21.993 --> 02:39:23.696]  And they're going, well, you'll still have your free speech.
[02:39:23.716 --> 02:39:25.278]  You can still have music and entertainment.
[02:39:25.842 --> 02:39:26.963]  This is unbelievable.
[02:39:27.023 --> 02:39:29.244]  So please, please, please.
[02:39:29.604 --> 02:39:31.465]  And I want to thank those that have gone to all the other meetings.
[02:39:31.505 --> 02:39:32.545]  It's been a long, hard fight.
[02:39:33.026 --> 02:39:34.126]  Please join us there.
[02:39:34.526 --> 02:39:38.629]  I want to thank some of the other local talk show hosts that have been speaking out and getting folks to come out to this.
[02:39:38.989 --> 02:39:40.349]  And some of them are going to be there as well.
[02:39:40.429 --> 02:39:47.033]  So, I'll see you tonight, 6.30, you know, get off work, pick the children up, whatever, and then take them with you.
[02:39:47.353 --> 02:39:52.215]  And one of the first things they'll be doing is letting Citizens Communication take place.
[02:39:52.235 --> 02:39:53.276]  You won't have to wait long.
[02:39:54.051 --> 02:39:54.731]  Please be there.
[02:39:54.751 --> 02:39:56.152]  You should be done by 8 o'clock tonight.
[02:39:56.552 --> 02:39:59.413]  Give Freedom an hour and a half of your time.
[02:40:00.033 --> 02:40:05.795]  I'm already suing them in a legal action just to get information, deposing them, but we already got 165 pages of documents.
[02:40:06.175 --> 02:40:08.115]  Last week it was even worse than we thought.
[02:40:10.536 --> 02:40:12.657]  It blows me away.
[02:40:13.377 --> 02:40:15.778]  So you do not want to miss this tonight.
[02:40:16.198 --> 02:40:19.919]  One more time, 1 Texas Center, 505 Barton Springs Road, room 325.
[02:40:22.097 --> 02:40:24.800]  Alright, continuing with this article from Skolnick's report.
[02:40:26.401 --> 02:40:32.226]  Just published the family, the real story of the Bush dynasty by veteran and highly controversial author Kitty Kelly.
[02:40:32.246 --> 02:40:38.372]  According to book industry sources, the publisher intends to issue a market one million copies of the book that is the lowdown on the Bushies.
[02:40:39.151 --> 02:40:55.064]  And in the book, it says, it mentions in Kitty Kelly's book following the already publicized independent investigation of Skolnik and his colleagues that George W. Bush cohabitated at his Texas ranch and elsewhere with the mayor of a major city in Tennessee, says Kitty Kelly.
[02:40:56.005 --> 02:41:01.349]  And they got the name of the mayor here and we're on the radio in that city and I'm not even going to get into it folks.
[02:41:02.209 --> 02:41:05.312]  It relates to George W. Bush's homosexual relationship
[02:41:06.192 --> 02:41:16.681]  Since about puberty with Bleep Bleep, longtime mayor of Bleep, when some in Congress began inquiries in the fall of 2003, and then it goes on.
[02:41:16.701 --> 02:41:21.965]  If you want to read this, it's on the website, so just go to SkullWenchReport.com.
[02:41:23.407 --> 02:41:25.869]  I'm just, I'm not going to go there.
[02:41:26.169 --> 02:41:29.672]  Even if Kitty Kelly and others want to talk about it, I'm not going to go there.
[02:41:31.139 --> 02:41:39.224]  Where I will go is the New York Post admitting, you know, superstar gay porn stars being shipped to, quote, service Bohemian Grove members.
[02:41:41.185 --> 02:41:48.809]  I mean, I've got Washington Times articles, I've got Spy Magazine articles, I've got Parade Magazine articles about the male prostitutes being shipped in for them.
[02:41:49.570 --> 02:41:51.371]  And this is your Christian conservatives, folks.
[02:41:51.411 --> 02:41:57.574]  I mean, you've got Arnold posing in gay magazines, you've got Arnold, Mr. Super Liberal, and oh, the conservatives just love him.
[02:41:57.614 --> 02:41:58.815]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[02:42:00.091 --> 02:42:01.151]  It's ridiculous!
[02:42:03.472 --> 02:42:04.673]  Just amazing.
[02:42:06.493 --> 02:42:07.393]  Continuing here.
[02:42:07.493 --> 02:42:08.014]  Globe.
[02:42:08.414 --> 02:42:10.815]  Bush didn't meet guard commitments.
[02:42:10.875 --> 02:42:16.637]  President Bush fell well short of meeting his military obligations in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War.
[02:42:16.677 --> 02:42:19.658]  The Boston Globe is punting the front page today, which they did do.
[02:42:19.678 --> 02:42:20.978]  Newsroom sources tell Drudge.
[02:42:21.850 --> 02:42:39.659]  The 1,500-word expose on Bush records comes just hours ahead of an exclusive CBS News interview set to air Wednesday night with a man who secured for the 22-year-old Yale graduate, Bush, a coveted place in the Texas State Air Guard.
[02:42:39.719 --> 02:42:45.882]  A man who now claims he regrets helping Bush, and that strings were pulled by CIA Director Bush Sr.
[02:42:45.942 --> 02:42:46.883]  to do that for him.
[02:42:47.843 --> 02:42:51.105]  So, Mr. Barnes is going to come out and admit that tonight.
[02:42:52.006 --> 02:42:54.388]  And again, lawsuit uncovers new Bush Guard records.
[02:42:54.408 --> 02:42:55.248]  These are not new.
[02:42:55.708 --> 02:43:00.492]  I got them, Joyce Riley got them from the Guard Depository in Missouri.
[02:43:01.552 --> 02:43:07.876]  And then Bush got them and blacked them out and declared national security, but not before they'd already been released!
[02:43:08.757 --> 02:43:19.384]  Months after issuing, insisting it could find no records of President Bush's Air National Guard service, the Defense Department has released more than two dozen pages of files, including Bush's report card for flight training and dates of his flights.
[02:43:19.989 --> 02:43:21.190]  That came out today.
[02:43:21.270 --> 02:43:25.794]  That is out of Michigan Associated Press.
[02:43:27.856 --> 02:43:28.997]  A bunch of other articles here.
[02:43:31.656 --> 02:43:32.677]  This is disgusting.
[02:43:32.697 --> 02:43:33.697]  This is out of the mirror.
[02:43:33.937 --> 02:43:37.278]  Girl 12 blamed by judge for sex attack.
[02:43:37.838 --> 02:43:44.720]  A judge yesterday freed a man who had sex with a girl of 12 and said that it was her fault that they ended up in bed.
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:53.243]  Child protection groups were furious after Michael Barnett, 20, was handed a two-year conditional discharge for the attack.
[02:43:54.243 --> 02:43:57.804]  Member of Parliament Dan Norris accused the judge of playing into the hands of pedophiles.
[02:43:59.075 --> 02:44:03.338]  Well, folks, the point is that a 12-year-old cannot make rational decisions.
[02:44:04.338 --> 02:44:06.219]  And, yeah, this is bad.
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:08.961]  And all over the place we see this being legitimized.
[02:44:09.161 --> 02:44:11.122]  Very, very, very serious.
[02:44:12.123 --> 02:44:12.403]  U.S.
[02:44:12.463 --> 02:44:14.804]  death toll in Iraq tops 1,000.
[02:44:14.864 --> 02:44:15.565]  We'll get to that.
[02:44:15.625 --> 02:44:17.366]  But first off, do we have that Ron Paul clip?
[02:44:19.881 --> 02:44:20.201]  Awesome.
[02:44:20.401 --> 02:44:22.462]  Go ahead and play this legislative update from Ron Paul.
[02:44:22.482 --> 02:44:25.203]  I actually have the text of it from PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:44:25.864 --> 02:44:31.786]  Reject the National ID Card is the headline, and here is the audio of that legislative update for this week.
[02:44:31.806 --> 02:44:32.227]  Here it is.
[02:44:32.887 --> 02:44:36.489]  Hello, this is Ron Paul with the weekly update for Monday, September 6th.
[02:44:37.529 --> 02:44:45.673]  Washington politicians are once again seriously considering imposing a National Identification Card, and it may well become law before the end of the 108th Congress.
[02:44:47.062 --> 02:44:57.713]  The much hailed 9-11 Commission Report released in July recommends a federal identification card and, worse, a larger network of screening points inside the United States.
[02:44:58.613 --> 02:45:07.022]  Does this mean we are to have screening points inside our country where American citizens will be required to show their papers to government officials?
[02:45:07.682 --> 02:45:09.044]  It certainly sounds that way.
[02:45:10.237 --> 02:45:20.045]  As I have written recently, the 9-11 Commission is nothing more than ex-government officials and lobbyists advising current government officials that we need more government for America to be safe.
[02:45:20.825 --> 02:45:23.948]  Yet it was that same government that failed so miserably on September 11, 2001.
[02:45:26.650 --> 02:45:31.013]  Congress has embraced the 9-11 Commission report uncritically since its release in July.
[02:45:31.033 --> 02:45:38.259]  Now Congress is rushing to write each 9-11 Commission recommendation into law before the November election.
[02:45:39.457 --> 02:45:46.242]  In the same way, Congress rushed to pass the Patriot Act after September 11th attacks to be seen doing something.
[02:45:46.582 --> 02:45:55.328]  It looks like Congress is about to make the same mistake again of rushing to pass liberty-destroying legislation without stopping to consider the consequences.
[02:45:56.769 --> 02:46:06.236]  Because it is so controversial, we may see legislation mandating a National Identification Card with biometric identifiers hidden in the bills implementing
[02:46:07.328 --> 02:46:09.289]  9-11 Commission Recommendations.
[02:46:09.409 --> 02:46:14.790]  We have seen this technique used in the past on controversial measures.
[02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:25.392]  A National Identification Card, in whatever form it may take, will allow the federal government to inappropriately monitor the movements and transactions of every American.
[02:46:26.513 --> 02:46:31.834]  History shows that governments inevitably use the power to monitor the actions of people in harmful ways.
[02:46:32.486 --> 02:46:39.648]  Claims that the government will protect the privacy of Americans when implementing a National Identification Card ring hollow.
[02:46:40.629 --> 02:46:43.910]  We would do well to remember what happened with Social Security Card.
[02:46:44.650 --> 02:46:51.933]  It was introduced with solemn restrictions on how it could be used, but it has become a de facto National Identification Card.
[02:46:52.633 --> 02:47:01.336]  Those who are willing to allow the government to establish a Soviet-style internal passport system because they think it will make us safer are terribly mistaken.
[02:47:02.192 --> 02:47:07.176]  Subjecting every citizen to surveillance and screening points will actually make us less safe.
[02:47:07.676 --> 02:47:16.702]  Not in the least because it will divert resources away from tracking and apprehending terrorists and redeploying them against innocent Americans.
[02:47:18.043 --> 02:47:26.828]  The federal government has no constitutional authority to require law-abiding Americans to present any form of identification before they engage in private transactions.
[02:47:27.429 --> 02:47:30.571]  Instead of forcing all Americans to prove to law enforcement
[02:47:31.343 --> 02:47:32.924]  At that, they are not terrorists.
[02:47:32.964 --> 02:47:37.446]  We should be focusing our resources on measures that really will make us safer.
[02:47:38.747 --> 02:47:43.309]  For starters, we should take a look at our dangerously porous and unguarded borders.
[02:47:43.889 --> 02:47:50.973]  We have seen already this summer how easy it is for individuals possibly seeking to do us harm to sneak across the border into our country.
[02:47:51.653 --> 02:47:55.855]  In July, Pakistani citizen Farida Goldman Mohammed Ahmed
[02:47:56.616 --> 02:47:57.656]  Okay, that's good.
[02:47:57.716 --> 02:47:59.217]  We've got a break.
[02:47:59.277 --> 02:48:02.557]  And I'm sorry, that's not Ron Paul's recording.
[02:48:02.577 --> 02:48:05.578]  Somehow a recording going on at the network was transmitted over that.
[02:48:05.598 --> 02:48:06.698]  But you got the gist.
[02:48:06.718 --> 02:48:09.839]  You can call that Ron Paul number and get that or read the text.
[02:48:22.938 --> 02:48:24.119]  PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:49:02.958 --> 02:49:07.002]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[02:49:09.084 --> 02:49:19.736]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:19.896 --> 02:49:21.759]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:51:38.956 --> 02:51:47.138]  Alright, gotta move quick now.
[02:51:48.456 --> 02:51:50.518]  Judges try to snatch homeschoolers.
[02:51:50.558 --> 02:51:52.519]  This is going on in the U.S., but this is out of Europe.
[02:51:52.919 --> 02:51:53.680]  World Net Daily.
[02:51:53.760 --> 02:51:57.122]  Families escape homeland to keep from losing children to state.
[02:51:57.162 --> 02:52:05.808]  Germans who choose to homeschool their children are coming under increasing pressure from the state, with some families escaping the European Union nation to keep from having their children taken from them.
[02:52:05.828 --> 02:52:15.155]  The U.S.-based Homeschool Legal Defense Association has appealed to its members to assist in the counterpart organizations in Germany as in battles for the right to homeschool.
[02:52:16.252 --> 02:52:17.415]  That's happening here in the U.S.
[02:52:17.455 --> 02:52:19.199]  and Illinois and also in California.
[02:52:19.900 --> 02:52:20.902]  This is out of BBC.
[02:52:21.043 --> 02:52:23.347]  UK mental health laws allow enforced treatment.
[02:52:23.388 --> 02:52:25.612]  The government can arbitrarily claim that you're mentally ill.
[02:52:26.536 --> 02:52:34.520]  And that dovetails with what's happening in the United States with the new Freedom Initiative to forcibly, mentally test everyone twice a year in the country.
[02:52:35.021 --> 02:52:39.343]  Illinois State Robber Association reports on confiscation of registered guns begins in Illinois.
[02:52:39.863 --> 02:52:48.608]  Chicago's team, or police, Chicago Anti-Gun Enforcement, or CAGE unit, yeah, putting us in a cage, has been all over the place confiscating legal guns.
[02:52:49.308 --> 02:52:54.231]  A big article on the website PrisonPlanet.com, we have this posted,
[02:52:55.212 --> 02:52:59.735]  It is a very, very scary, a long article that I should have gotten to earlier, but we're out of time.
[02:53:00.576 --> 02:53:00.876]  U.S.
[02:53:00.916 --> 02:53:03.778]  anti-abortion law ruled unconstitutional, Globe and Mail.
[02:53:04.758 --> 02:53:05.179]  A U.S.
[02:53:05.199 --> 02:53:13.424]  federal judge ruled the partial birth abortion ban act unconstitutional on Wednesday because it does not include a health exemption for the woman.
[02:53:13.544 --> 02:53:15.005]  Well, they can always say it's for their health.
[02:53:15.045 --> 02:53:15.845]  This is disgusting.
[02:53:16.165 --> 02:53:16.846]  The ruling by U.S.
[02:53:16.866 --> 02:53:21.609]  District Judge Richard Kompf of Lincoln followed similar decisions earlier in the two other cases.
[02:53:22.836 --> 02:53:24.397]  So that's what happened there.
[02:53:25.518 --> 02:53:36.146]  And just so much other key news folks of what's happening with the RFID tracker systems going on and going in at every level of our society.
[02:53:37.206 --> 02:53:43.551]  We have the gearing up with even liberal media like NPR calling for attacks on Iran.
[02:53:44.792 --> 02:53:46.753]  We just have so much that's happening.
[02:53:46.773 --> 02:53:48.915]  But the good news is that Zogby poll
[02:53:49.804 --> 02:53:51.465]  Half of New Yorkers believe U.S.
[02:53:51.625 --> 02:53:56.227]  leaders had foreknowledge of impending 9-11 attacks and consciously failed to act.
[02:53:56.427 --> 02:53:59.888]  66% call for new probe of unanswered questions by Congress.
[02:54:00.248 --> 02:54:08.152]  Our New York Attorney General, Eliot Spencer, New Zogby International Poll reveals, and it says that 49.3% of New York City residents
[02:54:12.168 --> 02:54:18.154]  Say that some of our leaders knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11th and they consciously failed to act.
[02:54:18.174 --> 02:54:24.980]  According to a new poll by Zogby International, the poll of Newark residents was conducted from Tuesday, August 24th to Thursday, August 26th.
[02:54:26.061 --> 02:54:28.043]  And the mainstream media has not reported on it.
[02:54:28.083 --> 02:54:32.707]  Also a national poll in Canada reported that 66% of Canadians believe the U.S.
[02:54:32.747 --> 02:54:33.708]  government was behind it.
[02:54:34.501 --> 02:54:38.603]  And one group, 75.6% of Hispanic New Yorkers believe the U.S.
[02:54:38.623 --> 02:54:40.203]  government was behind the attacks.
[02:54:40.623 --> 02:54:41.544]  This is big news.
[02:54:41.584 --> 02:54:43.945]  It's on the right-hand corner of PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:44.325 --> 02:54:45.345]  I hope everybody gets it.
[02:54:45.685 --> 02:54:50.587]  Also, an article I wrote with Paul Watson that he did most of the work on about NORAD's stand-down.
[02:54:50.607 --> 02:54:51.988]  We've already reported on this for years.
[02:54:52.068 --> 02:54:58.950]  We've codified it in one big article full of links and audio and video clips for you, how they use that drill to have NORAD stand down.
[02:54:59.230 --> 02:55:00.371]  That is huge news.
[02:55:00.491 --> 02:55:01.691]  Please get it out to everybody.
[02:55:02.111 --> 02:55:03.392]  And don't forget, I'll see you tonight.
[02:55:04.072 --> 02:55:10.013]  in Austin, Texas, to stand up against the City Council on their attempted shutdown of AXIS Television at 6.30 tonight.

[02:55:14.494 --> 02:55:16.634]  Press release is on Infowars.com.
[02:55:17.374 --> 02:55:20.755]  And the last 60 seconds of this global transmission against tyranny.
[02:55:21.155 --> 02:55:22.175]  I've made 10 films.
[02:55:22.695 --> 02:55:24.135]  My 11th film is now out.
[02:55:25.096 --> 02:55:30.657]  It's 90 minutes long, so it's 1995, American Dictators, the staged election of 2004.
[02:55:30.737 --> 02:55:32.877]  It's a must-see and you're authorized to make copies.
[02:55:33.664 --> 02:55:52.678]  And it's 15 cents a day to go watch it and all my other videos and books and materials at PrisonPlanet.TV or call toll free to get any of my films 1-888-253-3139 please call, please get the films, please show them to people, wake America up, we can win this fight.

[02:56:06.692 --> 02:56:09.753]  I'll be back tonight 9 to midnight central on the shortwave at 3210.
[02:56:10.034 --> 02:56:12.575]  Back tomorrow 11 to 2 on the shortwave at 9475.
[02:56:12.935 --> 02:56:14.716]  And on your local AM or FM affiliate.
[02:56:15.657 --> 02:56:18.478]  Yeah, it sounded pretty radical in the past saying the Globals were behind 9-11.
[02:56:18.758 --> 02:56:21.139]  Now half of New Yorkers think they were behind it.
[02:56:21.580 --> 02:56:24.901]  And 60 plus percent think they at least let it happen and had prior knowledge.
[02:56:25.822 --> 02:56:26.242]  Ha ha!
[02:56:26.282 --> 02:56:27.883]  We're gonna win this fight with God's help!
[02:56:28.519 --> 02:56:30.386]  I'll see you tonight at 6.30, my friends.
[02:56:30.446 --> 02:56:31.831]  Downtown Austin, take care.
