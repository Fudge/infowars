[00:00:05.443 --> 00:00:06.084]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:07.825]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:09.626]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:11.108]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:12.769]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.152]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:21.735]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.461]  Alright, my friends, it is Monday.
[00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:34.559]  The first day of March 2004.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.380]  Already into month number three.
[00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.022]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:47.485]  We have several very important guests coming up so please stay with us.
[00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:55.909]  Every week it seems there's even more news and it's impossible to cover the full dimensions and scope of it.
[00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.350]  Here's USA Today.
[00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:02.900]  President uses radio address to push anti-drug proposals.
[00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:18.057]  President Bush, preparing to unveil an anti-drug strategy on Saturday, championed the budget proposals to increase drug testing in schools, help more communities run prevention programs and pay for treatment
[00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.813]  Through religious groups for more low-income addicts.
[00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:27.417]  So that's turning the churches into law enforcement, tattletale social worker squads.
[00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:30.079]  And we've already seen the federal funding.
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.822]  School districts all over Central Texas, all over the country.
[00:01:33.842 --> 00:01:35.063]  I see the articles every day.
[00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:37.264]  All students must drug test.
[00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:38.765]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:45.931]  They're moving forward in states to force you to take vaccines, to force you to blow a breathalyzer.
[00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:47.572]  Everybody has to start their car.
[00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:50.297]  Total control.
[00:01:50.657 --> 00:01:52.018]  Cameras in the school bathrooms.
[00:01:52.058 --> 00:01:55.819]  I was on a syndicated show this morning and I said, you know, they're putting cameras in the bathrooms.
[00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.701]  And the host goes, yeah, I've seen that in the news, but isn't that needed to keep us safe?
[00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:00.862]  I mean, 1984!
[00:02:01.602 --> 00:02:02.683]  Cameras in the bathrooms!
[00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:03.563]  Keep us safe!
[00:02:03.603 --> 00:02:05.364]  I mean, what's wrong with you people?
[00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.005]  That Alex, he's radical.
[00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:10.366]  He's against cameras in the bathrooms and showers.
[00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:15.569]  Man, he's, whoa, he's... Man, that guy's, uh... We better arrest him.
[00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.670]  So that's one article.
[00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:21.679]  There's an article here that struck me to my core.
[00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:22.879]  I became physically ill.
[00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.059]  My wife started crying.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.041]  We already knew about this, but New York Post, children they've grabbed, CPS have gotten.
[00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:35.023]  There were articles last year where they grab your child or say, let us test drugs on your child or we'll take them.
[00:02:35.063 --> 00:02:38.724]  Now that's been in the New York Daily News, New York Post, it's been in the news.
[00:02:39.544 --> 00:02:40.405]  Just hell on earth.
[00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:43.105]  Well this one, CPS takes the kids.
[00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:44.846]  They're already in, you know, government health care.
[00:02:45.805 --> 00:02:53.209]  Then they would just test multiple vaccines on them, take the medication away, give them six times the normal dose, uh, kill the kids!
[00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:58.592]  Just literal hell on earth, worse than Tuskegee with the black men, and that's what CPS does.
[00:02:58.652 --> 00:03:01.314]  I mean, these are vampiric creatures.
[00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:04.035]  Well, a vampire, I guess, has its own dark energy source.
[00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:05.376]  These people don't even have that.
[00:03:05.776 --> 00:03:07.717]  They're just more like zombies.
[00:03:08.838 --> 00:03:09.818]  They just do whatever they're told.
[00:03:09.838 --> 00:03:10.599]  It's all normal.
[00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:20.312]  A New York Post, the State Health Department, has launched a probe into potentially dangerous drug research conducted on HIV-infected infants and children at Manhattan Foster Care Agency.
[00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:24.694]  It was tested on kids that didn't even have AIDS, by the way.
[00:03:24.974 --> 00:03:27.455]  You see, they really are good folks here.
[00:03:27.495 --> 00:03:35.178]  The Post has learned some 50 foster kids were used as guinea pigs in 13 experiments with high doses of AIDS medications in Manhattan's
[00:03:37.503 --> 00:03:44.545]  Incarnation Children's Center sources said most of the ICC experiments were funded by the federal grants, in some cases pharmacological companies.
[00:03:45.045 --> 00:03:51.726]  They used city foster care children who were sent to the Catholic Archdiocese-run facility by the Administration for Children's Services.
[00:03:52.706 --> 00:03:57.087]  ICC was involved in 36 different experiments according to the National Institute of Health website.
[00:03:57.668 --> 00:04:03.989]  One study researched HIV wasting syndrome which studied how a child's body changes when its medication is altered.
[00:04:05.494 --> 00:04:07.816]  By the way, they look worse than concentration camp victims.
[00:04:07.836 --> 00:04:09.197]  We've got photos on the website.
[00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:16.983]  A handful of experiments involved combining a six-stage drug, so-called cocktails, in children as young as three months.
[00:04:17.443 --> 00:04:23.668]  Another explores the reaction of not one, but two doses of measles vaccines in children ages six to seven months.
[00:04:24.332 --> 00:04:27.673]  Other studies tested the safety, tolerance, and toxicity of AIDS drugs.
[00:04:28.153 --> 00:04:37.597]  They are torturing these kids, and it's nothing short of murder, said Michael Elner, a minister and president of Health Education AIDS Liaison, an advocacy group for HIV patients.
[00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:40.317]  By the way, it goes on for page after page.
[00:04:40.337 --> 00:04:41.198]  It gets far worse.
[00:04:41.358 --> 00:04:42.358]  Far worse, okay?
[00:04:43.018 --> 00:04:45.739]  This is the government that wants control of your life.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.540]  And it's taking control.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.722]  By the way, they've used the Patriot Act to charge somebody who was doing pranks on the Internet.
[00:04:54.981 --> 00:04:56.605]  So, it's getting real bad, folks.
[00:04:56.645 --> 00:04:58.429]  Don't turn your guns in, that's all I can say.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.784]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:13.448]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:20.714]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.094 --> 00:05:27.199]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:28.560]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.842]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.002 --> 00:05:34.043]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.323 --> 00:05:41.567]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:45.249]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:50.334]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:09.473]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.693 --> 00:06:20.980]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrates, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.822]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.182 --> 00:06:30.645]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.805 --> 00:06:32.666]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:38.888]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:44.811]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:49.057]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.077 --> 00:06:49.799]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:50.500]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.805 --> 00:07:05.109]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:09.753]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.893 --> 00:07:14.276]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.316 --> 00:07:15.658]  The New World Order.
[00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:16.819]  Hammered!
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.664]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.744 --> 00:07:28.672]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.812 --> 00:07:30.815]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:31.195 --> 00:07:41.523]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.803 --> 00:07:47.167]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.611]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.631 --> 00:07:52.751]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:10.674]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.814 --> 00:08:24.720]  I'm not exaggerating when I say that the level of wickedness, the level of evil, watching the dogs of the New World Order, the hyenas, rip and tear the most innocent of us, the most defenseless,
[00:08:25.376 --> 00:08:34.123]  And then having to watch them sit up there on the news and talk about how good they are, and how they're taking all our freedoms and building this cage for us, because they care about us.
[00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:53.239]  I have a stack of articles of the anthrax shot killing troops and killing their children, causing massive deformities, mainstream news, the government knowing MMR shot causes massive brain damaging, their own internal documents, the government killing small children that CPS has grabbed in drug testing,
[00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:57.672]  Trying to telling parents, you can keep your kid if you just let us test drugs on him.
[00:08:58.012 --> 00:08:59.212]  I mean deadly drugs.
[00:08:59.652 --> 00:09:00.772]  This is mainstream news.
[00:09:01.973 --> 00:09:05.653]  And they're going to keep doing it right out in the open, right out in front of everybody.
[00:09:05.673 --> 00:09:09.014]  And now they're going to pass laws that you all got to take whatever vaccines they say.
[00:09:09.074 --> 00:09:11.574]  And you got to blow in the breathalyzer to start your car.
[00:09:11.774 --> 00:09:12.354]  All of you.
[00:09:12.374 --> 00:09:14.415]  And yeah, your cell phone tracks you.
[00:09:14.435 --> 00:09:16.635]  And yeah, we're putting cameras in the school bathrooms.
[00:09:16.695 --> 00:09:17.635]  It's to keep you safe.
[00:09:17.715 --> 00:09:20.396]  And just the insanity of this.
[00:09:21.678 --> 00:09:29.622]  And it turns out, of course, our government behind the whole Haiti situation, and they're about to stage the capture of Bin Laden, as we said they would do two years ago.
[00:09:31.563 --> 00:09:33.644]  It's just wall-to-wall news.
[00:09:33.904 --> 00:09:38.326]  I've never, and I keep saying this every week, it just gets worse and worse, I've never had a stack this big.
[00:09:38.466 --> 00:09:39.887]  Every article totally insane.
[00:09:41.487 --> 00:09:48.731]  I was up late last night studying this stuff, up this morning doing it, in between radio interviews, trying to wake people up, trying to warn people.
[00:09:50.104 --> 00:09:52.124]  I just want you to go to Infowars.com.
[00:09:52.184 --> 00:09:55.005]  We're posting some of the New York Post articles, uh, photos.
[00:09:56.385 --> 00:10:01.626]  These little children look like Jews in a concentration camp, but the government's just gonna keep doing it right out in front of everybody.
[00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:13.389]  By the way, we brought the Nazis over here, the Nazi scientists, uh, after, uh, World War II, and they're the ones that set up the eugenics, and actually helped set up the Tuskegee, taught our doctors how to do it.
[00:10:13.809 --> 00:10:18.810]  And now stuff far worse than Tuskegee on little babies that were taken from their parents,
[00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.310]  But it's okay!
[00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.750]  We're the government!
[00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:25.991]  Hand over your firearms and we'll treat you even nicer!
[00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:28.372]  Once we've got cameras in all your neighborhoods!
[00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:30.992]  And automatic gates to lower down on the highways!
[00:10:31.252 --> 00:10:36.953]  And more armored vehicles for our new black-clad police officers who cover their faces in badges!
[00:10:38.233 --> 00:10:40.974]  And more surveillance drones we've got in the skies!
[00:10:42.894 --> 00:10:43.834]  This is what's happening!
[00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:47.115]  This is what's happening in America and the world!
[00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:54.115]  Incidentally, we're on 94.75 during the day now on WWCR.
[00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:56.596]  94.75 and at night at 32.10.
[00:10:57.177 --> 00:11:06.924]  At night at 32.10 and during the day at 94.75 and we'll continue to be on WWRB if everything goes well there.
[00:11:07.945 --> 00:11:10.907]  Offering you more frequencies, more information.
[00:11:11.607 --> 00:11:13.449]  So during the day, the first two hours on 94.75.
[00:11:15.777 --> 00:11:19.878]  And at night, the last two hours are going to be on 3210.
[00:11:20.859 --> 00:11:24.020]  So 9475, we're on there right now.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.541]  And at night, the second two hours, 10 to midnight central, 3210.
[00:11:29.242 --> 00:11:39.365]  You can also listen, of course, at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:11:40.665 --> 00:11:45.187]  And again, something's wrong with you if this level of evil doesn't make you mad.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.484]  I have articles here where they're charging teenagers with an ounce of marijuana with the Patriot Act as terrorists.
[00:11:53.425 --> 00:12:01.610]  I have articles for somebody who did a prank on the internet, which is criminal, but they've been now charged under terrorism and are facing life in prison.
[00:12:02.871 --> 00:12:06.774]  I have articles here where they're using the Patriot Act every day against the general public.
[00:12:07.814 --> 00:12:10.176]  And you're not getting your rights, you're not getting due process.
[00:12:10.636 --> 00:12:14.479]  Again, it has nothing to do with terrorists, because the new definition of terrorism is everything.
[00:12:16.108 --> 00:12:21.790]  I have articles here just, just, just across the board of massive import, my friends.
[00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:24.331]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:12:27.793 --> 00:12:28.673]  I have Paul Watson.
[00:12:28.693 --> 00:12:29.914]  He hasn't been on for three weeks.
[00:12:30.514 --> 00:12:32.235]  The webmaster of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:32.795 --> 00:12:37.557]  We've broken several massive stories at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:37.597 --> 00:12:38.877]  He's the webmaster for Prison Planet.
[00:12:39.778 --> 00:12:45.300]  A photo was found from a 1982 San Francisco Chronicle article.
[00:12:46.997 --> 00:12:55.449]  Where John Kerry, the congressman, is smiling and adoring Anton LaVey, the satanist, at a meeting with him.
[00:12:57.431 --> 00:12:59.955]  And, you know, people are saying, wow, look at this photo.
[00:12:59.995 --> 00:13:03.500]  Well, don't forget, Kerry's a member of a real satanic order.
[00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:09.761]  That goes back hundreds of years to Germany and to 1832 in this country, the admitted U.S.
[00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:13.644]  branch of the Illuminati, according to the Associated Press and MSNBC.
[00:13:13.664 --> 00:13:26.732]  So, at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, we have John Forbes Carey with Anton LaVey shaking his hand, smiling at him with pleasure, and then the article quotes
[00:13:28.487 --> 00:13:35.131]  Quotes Kerry is saying that, well, I believe that we're all divine internally and that every religion has the truth.
[00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:39.513]  And Anton LeVay then says to him, this is the essence of Satanism.
[00:13:39.933 --> 00:13:40.574]  Well done!
[00:13:41.534 --> 00:13:47.377]  Those are quotes there out of the articles that, oh, that Mr. Kerry shows the essence of Satanism right in front of him.
[00:13:47.397 --> 00:13:48.898]  This is, you know, they're having a discussion.
[00:13:49.298 --> 00:13:55.301]  And that is exactly what a real Satanist would say, is that we're all divine, we're gods, individually.
[00:13:55.321 --> 00:13:58.003]  That's what the devil said in the garden, the snake said.
[00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:00.119]  And do as thou wilt.
[00:14:00.219 --> 00:14:01.320]  Just do whatever you want.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.021]  So, we got John Kerry and Anton LaVey.
[00:14:04.041 --> 00:14:04.881]  Do as thou wilt.
[00:14:04.921 --> 00:14:05.662]  Jump around.
[00:14:05.682 --> 00:14:10.823]  This is real fun, but... Again, people handle the full horror of this.
[00:14:10.844 --> 00:14:19.507]  Of course, the phony neocon Christian talk show hosts are all out exposing the fact now that... Oh my gosh!
[00:14:19.607 --> 00:14:21.948]  He went to a meeting with Anton LaVey!
[00:14:21.968 --> 00:14:27.750]  It was in the, you know, the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle, or in the front section of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:30.080]  This is amazing!
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.261]  This is unbelievable!
[00:14:31.281 --> 00:14:34.304]  There's a picture of Kerry with a big pentagram behind him, by the way.
[00:14:37.027 --> 00:14:37.767]  Very interesting.
[00:14:37.927 --> 00:14:39.329]  There they are in front of the pentagram.
[00:14:39.989 --> 00:14:40.550]  Oh my gosh!
[00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.211]  He's a devil!
[00:14:41.271 --> 00:14:42.472]  He's in skull and bones!
[00:14:43.272 --> 00:14:46.335]  Lord save us with Bush, your son!
[00:14:46.355 --> 00:14:47.677]  I mean, basically, I've heard him imply that.
[00:14:48.177 --> 00:14:48.918]  Bush is like this.
[00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.012]  This reincarnation, he's like representing God.
[00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:54.252]  It's like the Pope or something.
[00:14:54.492 --> 00:14:55.353]  It's blasphemous.
[00:14:55.373 --> 00:14:56.413]  I've heard some Christian stations.
[00:14:56.453 --> 00:14:59.375]  He's just anointed by God and the spirit of God's in him.
[00:14:59.695 --> 00:15:00.575]  But carries evil!
[00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:01.616]  He's in that skull and bones!
[00:15:01.656 --> 00:15:02.476]  But Bush is good!
[00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:03.757]  It's good when he's in it!
[00:15:03.977 --> 00:15:10.740]  It's good when he's... When he's saying, I love Ozzy Osbourne, death and hell and blood and... You know, in that speech he gave.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.041]  I've got that clip over here.
[00:15:12.061 --> 00:15:14.542]  His own little incantation.
[00:15:15.542 --> 00:15:17.543]  So that's coming up too, alright?
[00:15:17.603 --> 00:15:18.944]  But before I go any further,
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.822]  Before I go any further, I just want to spend 5-10 minutes with him.
[00:15:23.062 --> 00:15:24.183]  It's a horrible story.
[00:15:24.624 --> 00:15:25.564]  We've had him on the show.
[00:15:25.604 --> 00:15:26.745]  I have all the news articles.
[00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.086]  He's done absolutely nothing.
[00:15:28.947 --> 00:15:34.751]  Last year, South Texas, foreign troops, Mexican troops, illegals pouring across.
[00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:35.852]  They're down there at a ranch.
[00:15:35.932 --> 00:15:37.633]  They've got the national French media with them.
[00:15:37.653 --> 00:15:39.915]  They've documented it all and have testified.
[00:15:40.396 --> 00:15:41.596]  Two illegals come across.
[00:15:42.037 --> 00:15:42.857]  They give them blankets.
[00:15:42.877 --> 00:15:43.718]  It was cold that morning.
[00:15:43.758 --> 00:15:44.939]  Tell them, call the Border Patrol.
[00:15:44.979 --> 00:15:46.020]  Hey, these guys are illegal.
[00:15:47.173 --> 00:15:47.833]  They weren't hurt.
[00:15:47.853 --> 00:15:51.515]  There's film of all this, and photos, and actual French media.
[00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:52.836]  This'll happen to be there.
[00:15:53.156 --> 00:15:54.737]  They come and arrest Mr. Nethercott.
[00:15:54.757 --> 00:15:58.039]  You know, do all this horrible stuff to him.
[00:15:58.979 --> 00:16:02.701]  And then, uh, say he didn't show up for court, and do all the stuff which he did.
[00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:11.866]  Well, now the governor is issued under the Patriot Act, and he has this directly from the prosecutor, Mr. North, uh, that he's gonna be arrested at, uh, 2 o'clock, uh, Mountain.
[00:16:12.626 --> 00:16:14.467]  Uh, that's in, uh, about, uh,
[00:16:15.214 --> 00:16:18.255]  Two hours or three hours from now.
[00:16:19.615 --> 00:16:21.696]  And he's not being charged.
[00:16:21.716 --> 00:16:25.017]  He'll just be held without bail in a prison there.
[00:16:25.057 --> 00:16:28.658]  The last time he was arrested for no reason and not charged for 50-something days.
[00:16:29.098 --> 00:16:32.459]  They just threw him in a dark cell with the lights off for 50-something days.
[00:16:32.499 --> 00:16:34.819]  And if he asked for a lawyer, they wouldn't feed him.
[00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:37.000]  And then they just finally relieved him because of the outcry.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.181]  The Morris Dees and others have said they're going to get him.
[00:16:40.781 --> 00:16:45.203]  And Bush does not want anybody down on the border exposing the foreign troops, the illegals.
[00:16:45.563 --> 00:16:48.204]  The FBI has said, we're going to frame you, we're going to get you.
[00:16:48.744 --> 00:17:00.329]  Joining us with this, who's going to be arrested publicly for no reason, they even say for no reason, here in a couple hours, is Casey Nethercott from Camp Thunderbird down there at the invasion point in Cochise County, Arizona.
[00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:01.989]  Good to have you on, Casey.
[00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:03.410]  Thanks Alex, I appreciate it.
[00:17:04.376 --> 00:17:06.877]  Maybe if you were hanging out with Anton LaVey, you'd be okay.
[00:17:07.197 --> 00:17:10.058]  No, sir, I'm a Christian believer in Jesus.
[00:17:10.158 --> 00:17:10.798]  I can't do that.
[00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:13.778]  Well, we better boycott you and any movies about it.
[00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:18.120]  Well, sir, I... You know, so what if it just made 78 million over the weekend?
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.080]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.081]  Well, I'm sorry, but I can't believe in that Anton stuff.
[00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:23.721]  I'm going to have to just write that off.
[00:17:23.801 --> 00:17:24.961]  Well, we better boycott you then.
[00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:25.801]  You're pretty radical.
[00:17:26.502 --> 00:17:27.402]  No, sir, I'm not.
[00:17:27.562 --> 00:17:30.623]  All right, so, well, you know, the passion of Christ is pretty mad about that.
[00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:33.739]  What's happening to you right now?
[00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:39.061]  Okay, the governor of Arizona has decided that they don't want me to have due process anymore.
[00:17:39.101 --> 00:17:48.244]  They've written a warrant, a gubernatorial warrant, for my arrest for no charges, for no reasons, and for no speculations.
[00:17:48.304 --> 00:17:51.005]  In other words, when you're arrested, you get charges.
[00:17:51.086 --> 00:17:51.986]  There's nothing on this.
[00:17:52.386 --> 00:17:54.607]  They're taking my right to go to a judge away.
[00:17:54.947 --> 00:17:56.908]  They're taking my right to go to a jury away.
[00:17:57.268 --> 00:17:59.789]  They're taking every single right away from me.
[00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:00.809]  And are you ready for this?
[00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.090]  Including an attorney!
[00:18:03.038 --> 00:18:08.200]  And they're going to hold me in this prison until they can ship me off to Texas or whenever they feel like letting me go.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.541]  Now, by the way, you have this in writing from the District Attorney, from the prosecutor?
[00:18:13.721 --> 00:18:14.361]  Yes, sir, I do.
[00:18:15.182 --> 00:18:17.022]  Now, I want you to fax me a copy of that.
[00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:18.763]  I'll get it posted on the website.
[00:18:18.783 --> 00:18:20.763]  You guys have this on the Ranch Rescue website yet?
[00:18:20.803 --> 00:18:21.183]  No, sir.
[00:18:21.223 --> 00:18:26.185]  We've waited until I was on your program before we told the public about it, but I'll have you a copy of it by tonight.
[00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:37.111]  Yeah, well let me give you, during the break, I'll give you my fax number and we'll get that, or you can email it to tips at infowars.com scanned in, that'd be better.
[00:18:38.352 --> 00:18:43.515]  Now, by the way, they're doing this to people online, pulling pranks on the internet.
[00:18:43.535 --> 00:18:44.876]  They're doing this to pot dealers.
[00:18:45.597 --> 00:18:49.439]  Eighteen year old kids who get caught selling a small bag of marijuana.
[00:18:51.218 --> 00:18:55.341]  Well, Alex, what your listeners don't understand is... You haven't even done that!
[00:18:55.401 --> 00:18:56.282]  You've done nothing!
[00:18:56.382 --> 00:18:56.682]  Nothing!
[00:18:56.722 --> 00:18:57.603]  There's no charges!
[00:18:58.264 --> 00:19:04.349]  And by the way, you said you're going to go to your, quote, trial, coming up with the 16th of March.
[00:19:04.969 --> 00:19:05.670]  15th, sir.
[00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:13.096]  You said you're going to that, but they say you're not allowed to leave the state because of bond on the last time they arrested you in Arizona with no charges.
[00:19:13.136 --> 00:19:13.656]  Correct, sir.
[00:19:13.676 --> 00:19:16.298]  They also told me that if I don't surrender at 2.30 today,
[00:19:17.659 --> 00:19:21.241]  That they would bring the National Guard down here to this camp and take me out of here.
[00:19:21.821 --> 00:19:24.642]  So they want another Waco confrontation.
[00:19:24.822 --> 00:19:26.883]  They're hoping you guys have a confrontation with them.
[00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:27.783]  That's what they want.
[00:19:27.823 --> 00:19:28.764]  They're provoking it.
[00:19:28.964 --> 00:19:32.145]  They're lying, they're making things up, and they're provoking it.
[00:19:33.086 --> 00:19:34.466]  And folks, I've studied this whole case.
[00:19:34.526 --> 00:19:35.507]  Casey's not kidding.
[00:19:35.547 --> 00:19:36.347]  It's this bad.
[00:19:37.168 --> 00:19:38.868]  Well, I mean, I just read the New York Post.
[00:19:38.888 --> 00:19:43.450]  They're grabbing kids, CPSs, and killing them with experimental drugs and vaccines publicly.
[00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:47.132]  I mean, you know, these people are not playing games.
[00:19:47.702 --> 00:19:49.663]  But wickedness is upon us now!
[00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:51.624]  Hey, so you do one more segment with us.
[00:19:51.644 --> 00:19:52.304]  This is big.
[00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:55.506]  And then before I end the show today, I want to get you back on for an update.
[00:19:56.006 --> 00:19:58.267]  Give out any phone numbers to try to expose these people.
[00:19:58.307 --> 00:19:58.767]  We'll be back.
[00:19:58.787 --> 00:19:59.168]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.489 --> 00:20:04.250]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.192]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:20:08.692 --> 00:20:09.372]  Let's update.
[00:20:09.873 --> 00:20:13.314]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:20:15.236 --> 00:20:17.697]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[00:20:18.377 --> 00:20:21.678]  Two years ago, the US dollar was worth 17% more than the euro.
[00:20:22.198 --> 00:20:25.339]  Today, the US dollar is worth 28% less than the euro.
[00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:27.279]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:29.840]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.582]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:20:37.042 --> 00:20:37.802]  Gold is moving.
[00:20:38.062 --> 00:20:39.203]  Equities are treading water.
[00:20:39.623 --> 00:20:42.283]  They say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:20:42.824 --> 00:20:44.144]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:20:44.605 --> 00:20:46.326]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:20:46.747 --> 00:20:48.708]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[00:23:44.526 --> 00:23:49.990]  Remember, one million dollars in term life insurance coverage for as little as three dollars a day.
[00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:51.251]  Call right now.
[00:23:51.551 --> 00:23:53.052]  Operators are standing by.
[00:23:53.072 --> 00:23:53.112]  800-430-6692.
[00:23:53.132 --> 00:23:53.172]  800-430-6692.
[00:24:02.192 --> 00:24:07.336]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.017 --> 00:24:10.358]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:11.459 --> 00:24:18.184]  We radiate out on the radio, on your local AM and FM dials, if that's how you're listening to us.
[00:24:18.544 --> 00:24:22.968]  Simulcast on the internet at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:26.970]  And now we're on WWCR.
[00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.311]  And we've only got four hours a day.
[00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:31.471]  It doesn't cover the whole six, but we're going to get more time.
[00:24:32.192 --> 00:24:34.333]  The first two hours of the daytime show from 11 to 1.
[00:24:34.413 --> 00:24:35.493]  The show, of course, is 11 to 2.
[00:24:35.533 --> 00:24:35.853]  11 to 1 will be on 94.75.
[00:24:35.913 --> 00:24:38.734]  And at night, the second two hours from 10 to midnight central at 32.10.
[00:24:48.092 --> 00:24:54.377]  And we're looking to get time on another frequency in the first hour at night and the third hour during the day.
[00:24:54.717 --> 00:25:12.750]  All the more reason, if you've been a shortwave listener all these years, the last eight years I've been on shortwave, since we got started our syndication, with the shortwave being the bedrock of that, all the more reason if you're listening on the internet or shortwave to call and get us a local AM or FM affiliate in your area.
[00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:17.354]  If you're already listening to us on an AM or FM station, certainly support those great folks and spread the word.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:25.745]  And we'll post those frequencies at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and we'll also get them posted at GCMLive.com.
[00:25:25.785 --> 00:25:41.897]  Now I know we've got Bert and Rod and Tim and others and I've got a bunch of news I want to get to but understand with the Casey Nethercott case, they just kidnapped him for 50 plus days in Arizona and didn't even say why they were grabbing him and this was in the mainstream news.
[00:25:43.578 --> 00:25:47.641]  They first arrested him in Texas when they were documenting the illegals coming across the border.
[00:25:48.768 --> 00:25:57.936]  But they had national French television there, news there, so that individual said they testify, so they are like going back and forth on charging him there.
[00:25:58.257 --> 00:26:01.359]  Then they tried to claim he didn't show up for trial, which turned out to be a fraud.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.202]  We've told this whole story on air.
[00:26:04.702 --> 00:26:05.383]  It's incredible.
[00:26:05.803 --> 00:26:08.245]  Now the governor says she's sick of it.
[00:26:08.906 --> 00:26:14.210]  She's coming after Casey Nethercott this afternoon at 230 Mountain.
[00:26:15.675 --> 00:26:20.157]  With the National Guard, if he doesn't, quote, turn himself in.
[00:26:20.557 --> 00:26:22.657]  Turn yourself in where and for what?
[00:26:25.418 --> 00:26:25.838]  Casey?
[00:26:26.098 --> 00:26:35.161]  Well, Alex, considering there's no charges, this is all trumped up from the Governor's office, turn myself in because she doesn't want me free.
[00:26:35.922 --> 00:26:41.464]  This is being done under the auspice of the Patriot Act and gubernatorial law given by the Patriot Act.
[00:26:41.764 --> 00:26:42.664]  There's no charges!
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.043]  This is just go to the gulag because we don't like what you're doing.
[00:26:47.365 --> 00:26:49.267]  And they're telling you to turn yourself in where?
[00:26:49.768 --> 00:26:54.734]  Oh, actually, today I have to turn myself in to a sheriff's department.
[00:26:55.735 --> 00:27:00.621]  Well, that's better than the prison they put you in without indicting you or charging you or... Correct.
[00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:02.323]  I'll be transferred there by today.
[00:27:02.859 --> 00:27:04.421]  Oh, so you will be transferred back to the prison?
[00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:08.344]  Absolutely, they don't want me to have a phone, they don't want me to have any way to contact with the outside.
[00:27:08.865 --> 00:27:12.508]  So now you go directly to solitary confinement, no charges, no nothing?
[00:27:12.609 --> 00:27:14.110]  Right, it's the same thing North Korea does.
[00:27:14.651 --> 00:27:16.853]  And you already spent 50 plus days in there?
[00:27:17.013 --> 00:27:17.593]  Yes sir, I did.
[00:27:17.774 --> 00:27:22.478]  And you said with it leaking and no light, and then if you complained to a lawyer, you wouldn't get food?
[00:27:22.658 --> 00:27:23.339]  Right, that's correct.
[00:27:23.883 --> 00:27:29.806]  Well, I mean, at least you're not a newborn baby grabbed by CPS in New York where they kill you with drugs and vaccine testing.
[00:27:30.126 --> 00:27:31.747]  That's the New York Post today, by the way.
[00:27:32.168 --> 00:27:32.668]  I believe it.
[00:27:32.948 --> 00:27:34.449]  Oh, I mean, that's the New York Post, folks.
[00:27:34.469 --> 00:27:35.429]  This is your government.
[00:27:35.609 --> 00:27:36.510]  They're sickos.
[00:27:38.671 --> 00:27:45.095]  And they got all these well-meaning idiots in and out of government going along, not asking questions, making excuses for these monsters.
[00:27:46.135 --> 00:27:47.556]  Casey, what are you going to do at 2.30?
[00:27:48.096 --> 00:27:50.978]  Well, to be honest with you, sir, they told me if I don't surrender,
[00:27:51.687 --> 00:27:55.049]  They're gonna send the National Guard at me, not the police, the National Guard.
[00:27:55.169 --> 00:28:01.934]  Now the FBI said, they told you, and you didn't listen to the officer's name, he said, we're going to frame you real soon.
[00:28:02.174 --> 00:28:11.760]  Oh sure, yeah, of course they are, and because your show has put that out to the people, that went out the door, so this is probably their second attempt to put me away for anything.
[00:28:12.832 --> 00:28:18.395]  And now, did the governor tell you to the prosecutor this, or you said you have a copy of this?
[00:28:18.415 --> 00:28:19.475]  We have it in writing, sir.
[00:28:19.535 --> 00:28:21.236]  She's denying me my right to a judge.
[00:28:21.256 --> 00:28:22.777]  Yeah, why don't you read this to people?
[00:28:23.777 --> 00:28:24.058]  Read it?
[00:28:24.118 --> 00:28:25.118]  No, I don't have it with me.
[00:28:25.198 --> 00:28:30.240]  Actually, we've mailed it to some of your Patriot listeners, so that if they do come here, they don't capture it.
[00:28:30.401 --> 00:28:31.881]  But you have the original copy, though?
[00:28:31.921 --> 00:28:32.301]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:32.562 --> 00:28:37.664]  And when I was in court yesterday, we gave it to one of our delivery persons with Ranch Rescue.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:43.021]  And she took it and left with it, and afterwards they arrested me and handcuffed me and said, where's the paperwork?
[00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:46.542]  Oh yeah, it's the secret paperwork under the Patriot Act.
[00:28:46.582 --> 00:28:53.403]  Well, sir, you need to fax me a copy of that immediately, and I'll get it up on the website.
[00:28:53.623 --> 00:28:54.363]  You'll see tonight.
[00:28:54.403 --> 00:28:55.724]  Your listeners will see tonight.
[00:28:56.024 --> 00:28:57.904]  Well, are you going to send it now, or are you going to send it tonight?
[00:28:58.224 --> 00:29:02.585]  I have to send it tonight, because it's hidden, so the government won't find it.
[00:29:03.723 --> 00:29:06.043]  Well, that's... We don't have to live like that, Alex.
[00:29:06.083 --> 00:29:06.804]  They'll kill us.
[00:29:06.904 --> 00:29:10.324]  If they get one inch, they'll kill us.
[00:29:10.424 --> 00:29:11.525]  They'll pull our people over.
[00:29:11.565 --> 00:29:12.325]  They'll threaten them.
[00:29:12.765 --> 00:29:14.305]  They throw me in jail without charges.
[00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:20.026]  Well, you had over 45 agents grab you and a reporter when they first put you in there for 50 plus days without charges.
[00:29:20.066 --> 00:29:20.366]  Yes, sir.
[00:29:20.386 --> 00:29:22.767]  And they charged me with absolutely nothing and then released me.
[00:29:23.507 --> 00:29:28.828]  By the way, they admit that a judge can now order drugging and hold you indefinitely.
[00:29:29.676 --> 00:29:32.117]  Well, that's why I'm calling you now, so your listeners can hear me now.
[00:29:32.717 --> 00:29:34.938]  Casey, do you want to give any phone numbers out or anything?
[00:29:35.158 --> 00:29:37.779]  Yeah, www.ranchrescue.com.
[00:29:37.919 --> 00:29:41.921]  Please, anybody that can hear me, we need help.
[00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:44.022]  So you're planning to turn yourself in today?
[00:29:44.522 --> 00:29:44.922]  I have to.
[00:29:45.163 --> 00:29:45.683]  I have to.
[00:29:46.323 --> 00:29:47.443]  If I don't... Stay there.
[00:29:47.463 --> 00:29:49.264]  We'll do a few more minutes, then we'll go to more news and call.
[00:29:49.284 --> 00:29:49.664]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.425 --> 00:29:52.326]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.806 --> 00:29:54.426]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.347 --> 00:29:58.008]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.022 --> 00:30:07.226]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:30:07.686 --> 00:30:15.452]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:30:15.812 --> 00:30:23.657]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:30:23.977 --> 00:30:28.719]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:30:29.059 --> 00:30:33.760]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.142]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.740]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.221 --> 00:33:11.042]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.703 --> 00:33:16.024]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:16.084 --> 00:33:16.864]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:16.884 --> 00:33:18.065]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:19.241 --> 00:33:21.942]  Back from 9 to Midnight Central as well, my friends.
[00:33:22.483 --> 00:33:24.504]  We're about to finish up with Casey Nethercott.
[00:33:25.004 --> 00:33:26.445]  He's committed absolutely no crime.
[00:33:27.965 --> 00:33:35.549]  All started last year in Texas, Ranch Rescue down there documenting the tens of millions of illegals that are pouring across our borders back and forth each year.
[00:33:36.009 --> 00:33:38.651]  Covering the thousands that were coming across at one Texas ranch.
[00:33:39.691 --> 00:33:44.934]  And in front of national news media from France, videotaped giving him blankets and calling the Border Patrol on him.
[00:33:46.201 --> 00:33:51.344]  Border Patrol refused to come, but they later went and claimed that they'd been beaten by Casey and others.
[00:33:51.384 --> 00:34:04.573]  Turned out that was a total fraud, and been a total lie, and then suddenly Arizona just didn't like him out there at his ranch that he owns, and has been kidnapping him on a routine basis, and now they said we're gonna send the National Guard in this morning.
[00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:11.855]  They told him this morning that this afternoon that's going to happen if they don't submit properly under the Patriot Act.
[00:34:11.895 --> 00:34:12.956]  And he's not going to be charged.
[00:34:13.136 --> 00:34:15.498]  No lawyer, no phone, no nothing.
[00:34:15.538 --> 00:34:19.020]  He's just going to have to turn himself in or they'll send the National Guard in.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.663]  They'd love to have some type of, you know, big military confrontation.
[00:34:22.703 --> 00:34:27.247]  Another Waco down there to scare American citizens away.
[00:34:28.047 --> 00:34:30.789]  And that includes Mr. Simcox and Mr.
[00:34:32.751 --> 00:34:35.852]  Well, I'm supposed to go down to the Sheriff's Department and turn myself in, or I can go to the
[00:34:54.065 --> 00:34:57.288]  District Attorney's Office and they'll walk me into a courtroom and have me remanded.
[00:34:57.588 --> 00:34:59.170]  And they're not saying why.
[00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.172]  There's no charges.
[00:35:01.572 --> 00:35:03.034]  There's no indictment.
[00:35:03.114 --> 00:35:05.556]  It's just the governor has written a warrant for my arrest.
[00:35:05.876 --> 00:35:07.258]  She does not want me free.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:14.244]  And she says they're using the Patriot Act and... For the gubernatorial authority to do this.
[00:35:14.264 --> 00:35:15.626]  Yes, you don't go to the judge anymore.
[00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:16.647]  You go to politicians.
[00:35:17.167 --> 00:35:19.109]  That's who decides whether you're free or not now.
[00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:31.163]  Well, I mean, Bush, the Secret Service has said that you can have a thousand pro-Bush supporters, one person has a sign not supporting them, public street, public park, they're arrested, federally charged, federally convicted.
[00:35:32.603 --> 00:35:33.744]  It's a brave new world.
[00:35:35.404 --> 00:35:37.465]  What Sheriff's Department are you turning yourself into?
[00:35:37.665 --> 00:35:38.305]  Pima County.
[00:35:39.006 --> 00:35:40.626]  It's up here in Tucson, Arizona.
[00:35:41.647 --> 00:35:45.688]  From there I'll be moved into federal custody at a prison, not a jail, a prison.
[00:35:46.229 --> 00:35:51.224]  Or I'll be hidden until... They can hold me for... Does your viewers realize they can hold me up to two years?
[00:35:51.963 --> 00:35:53.204]  Without justice?
[00:35:53.244 --> 00:35:53.864]  Without a jury?
[00:35:53.884 --> 00:35:54.544]  Without a judge?
[00:35:54.684 --> 00:36:01.267]  Well, actually, the Supreme Court just ruled that they can forcibly drug Dr. Charles T. Sell with no charges for seven years.
[00:36:01.487 --> 00:36:02.628]  It's coming up on seven.
[00:36:03.148 --> 00:36:07.350]  And he was the Waco... He was the Pentagon dentist there.
[00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:11.052]  The last week of the Waco siege, he went public and said they killed those people.
[00:36:11.592 --> 00:36:18.015]  So, a few years into him going public, they grabbed him and forcibly drugged him in solitary confinement for almost seven years.
[00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:19.476]  I hope that doesn't happen to you, Casey.
[00:36:19.776 --> 00:36:20.817]  Alex, I don't know what to do.
[00:36:20.837 --> 00:36:21.638]  I need help.
[00:36:21.978 --> 00:36:22.818]  I need your listeners.
[00:36:22.958 --> 00:36:24.580]  I need help.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.202]  They're really, I really think, this time, they're going to do it right.
[00:36:29.143 --> 00:36:29.924]  They're going to hide me.
[00:36:29.944 --> 00:36:31.405]  They're going to move me to Alaska.
[00:36:31.725 --> 00:36:32.606]  They're going to drug me.
[00:36:32.626 --> 00:36:35.368]  They're going to do whatever it takes to keep me from being released.
[00:36:36.388 --> 00:36:36.729]  Who knows?
[00:36:36.769 --> 00:36:38.950]  They might do what they do to three-month-old babies.
[00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:44.094]  They might take you to a CPS death ward, a Joseph Mengele Center, and inject you with poisons.
[00:36:44.454 --> 00:36:46.796]  Do you know that they actually somewhat tried that?
[00:36:47.176 --> 00:36:49.078]  I'm a diabetic, in case your listeners don't know.
[00:36:49.645 --> 00:36:54.325]  And they wanted to experiment with new diabetic drugs on me when I was in the jail.
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.901]  In the prison back here up in Tucson.
[00:36:57.001 --> 00:36:58.302]  Oh, you didn't know that was standard?
[00:36:58.322 --> 00:37:01.744]  They have drug company doctors in almost all federal prisons.
[00:37:02.185 --> 00:37:04.046]  I was in the mainstream news here in Texas.
[00:37:04.106 --> 00:37:13.953]  The disease spread and got whole towns sick and they're grafting dioxin into people's backs and bioweapons and they're killing prisoners in Huntsville.
[00:37:14.653 --> 00:37:16.154]  Oh, that was a Houston Chronicle.
[00:37:16.314 --> 00:37:17.755]  We've had all the folks on about that.
[00:37:17.955 --> 00:37:20.497]  Well, I don't know what to tell the American public except we need help.
[00:37:21.317 --> 00:37:24.460]  All right, what's the phone number, Casey?
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:24.840]  520-364-3966.
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:30.765]  Okay, now, what about a number for the Governor of Arizona?
[00:37:31.626 --> 00:37:33.587]  Alex, you can't get a hold of the Governor of this.
[00:37:33.727 --> 00:37:36.470]  You have to call a switchboard and be transferred.
[00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.672]  Okay, so folks call the Arizona State House, or what do they do?
[00:37:39.692 --> 00:37:40.073]  Oh, yes, sir.
[00:37:40.093 --> 00:37:41.774]  They call the Arizona Governor's House.
[00:37:42.255 --> 00:37:43.295]  Or the Governor's Mansion.
[00:37:43.356 --> 00:37:43.776]  Either one.
[00:37:44.278 --> 00:37:46.500]  Okay, and do you have that number in front of you?
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.181]  No, you don't have it.
[00:37:47.221 --> 00:37:50.784]  They change it routinely so that they aren't bombarded with press and media.
[00:37:51.164 --> 00:37:53.006]  I'm telling you, there's something wrong out here.
[00:37:53.326 --> 00:37:54.547]  The government is gone.
[00:37:55.536 --> 00:37:55.957]  No, I know.
[00:37:55.997 --> 00:37:57.959]  They're getting rid of the sovereignty, getting rid of the border.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.164]  Casey, I want to have you on the last ten minutes of the third hour to give us an update.
[00:38:02.204 --> 00:38:03.185]  Get me those phone numbers.
[00:38:03.566 --> 00:38:04.547]  You can call information.
[00:38:04.607 --> 00:38:06.349]  Get all that ready and we'll have you on at the end of the show.
[00:38:06.609 --> 00:38:07.230]  I'll do it, sir.
[00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:07.811]  Thanks a lot.
[00:38:07.851 --> 00:38:08.472]  God bless you.
[00:38:08.532 --> 00:38:08.992]  Thank you, sir.
[00:38:09.493 --> 00:38:11.395]  By the way, I wasn't kidding about the children.
[00:38:11.495 --> 00:38:13.638]  This is out of the New York Post.
[00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:20.024]  Last year, the New York Post and the New York Daily News talked about poor families.
[00:38:20.284 --> 00:38:22.086]  Parents have done nothing of their own welfare.
[00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:27.612]  CPS comes with a drug company representative and says, put your child on experimental drugs.
[00:38:27.992 --> 00:38:28.713]  Let him be sick.
[00:38:29.194 --> 00:38:29.874]  We're going to take him.
[00:38:29.894 --> 00:38:30.695]  You'll never see him again.
[00:38:31.496 --> 00:38:34.199]  And that's been in the news with thousands of children.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.782]  Well, this is the New York Post today.
[00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:39.381]  By Douglas Montero.
[00:38:40.002 --> 00:38:43.602]  The State Health Department has launched a probe so they'll whitewash it.
[00:38:43.702 --> 00:38:44.263]  It's massive.
[00:38:44.303 --> 00:38:45.023]  It's in every state.
[00:38:45.443 --> 00:38:54.445]  The State Health Department has launched a probe into potentially dangerous drug research conducted on HIV-infected infants and children at a Manhattan foster care agency.
[00:38:54.885 --> 00:39:02.007]  The Post has learned some 50 foster kids were used as guinea pigs in 13 experiments with high doses of AIDS medications at Manhattan's
[00:39:03.102 --> 00:39:10.683]  Incarnation Children's Center sources said most of the ICC experiments were funded by federal grants and in some cases pharmacological companies.
[00:39:11.024 --> 00:39:18.025]  They used city foster care who were sent to the Catholic Archdiocese run facility by the Administration for Children's Services.
[00:39:18.485 --> 00:39:22.706]  ICC was involved in 36 different experiments according to the National Institutes of Health website.
[00:39:23.046 --> 00:39:29.067]  One study researched HIV wasting syndrome which studied how a child's body changes when his medicine is altered.
[00:39:29.187 --> 00:39:30.167]  I actually read the study
[00:39:31.274 --> 00:39:36.978]  Folks, this one may take the medication away or they increase the dosage.
[00:39:37.038 --> 00:39:38.339]  It's like the Tuskegee Experiment.
[00:39:38.639 --> 00:39:40.640]  We don't give some medication, we give some others.
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.262]  They take your kid, don't give medication, watch him die.
[00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:45.005]  You starting to understand?
[00:39:45.445 --> 00:39:46.146]  You starting to get it?
[00:39:46.686 --> 00:39:52.147]  A handful of the experiments involved combining up the six AIDS drugs, so-called cocktails, and children as young as three months.
[00:39:52.527 --> 00:39:58.709]  Another explored the reaction of not one, but two doses of measles vaccines in kids aged six to seven months.
[00:39:59.329 --> 00:40:03.130]  Other studies tested the safety, tolerance, and toxicity of AIDS drugs.
[00:40:04.112 --> 00:40:05.093]  Experimental drugs, folks.
[00:40:05.533 --> 00:40:14.220]  They are torturing these kids, and it's nothing short of murder, said Michael Elner, a minister and president of Health Education AIDS Liaison, an advocacy group for HIV parents.
[00:40:15.882 --> 00:40:27.511]  Biochemist Dr. David Raznick, a visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley and an expert on AIDS medication, was outraged because the drugs alone, or combined, have an acute toxicity which could be fatal.
[00:40:28.453 --> 00:40:36.238]  He said the drug's side effects include several severe liver damage, cancerous tumors, severe anemia, muscle wasting.
[00:40:36.258 --> 00:40:37.439]  Those drugs kill you.
[00:40:37.899 --> 00:40:39.840]  And then some of the drugs that are good, they take them off those.
[00:40:40.141 --> 00:40:45.664]  Severe and life-threatening rashes and buffalo hump, where fatty tissues accumulate behind the neck.
[00:40:45.684 --> 00:40:46.825]  That's because they're giving them steroids.
[00:40:47.445 --> 00:41:00.374]  Housed in a former convent run by the Archdiocese of New York Catholic Charities, demonic filth bags, the foster care agency described by the experiments on its website, which was abruptly shut down after the Post began making inquiries.
[00:41:00.394 --> 00:41:01.495]  See, they don't even hide this.
[00:41:01.895 --> 00:41:02.856]  I already know about this.
[00:41:03.016 --> 00:41:04.057]  This is going on everywhere.
[00:41:04.077 --> 00:41:05.778]  I have to live in this hell!
[00:41:06.098 --> 00:41:07.379]  In this torture hell!
[00:41:07.779 --> 00:41:11.422]  Because you people won't take action and bring these people to justice!
[00:41:12.382 --> 00:41:13.543]  I'm the normal person!
[00:41:14.003 --> 00:41:14.964]  This makes me sick!
[00:41:15.244 --> 00:41:15.965]  I'm in pain!
[00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:17.907]  I'm in pain!
[00:41:17.927 --> 00:41:19.960]  I'm in pain!
[00:41:21.241 --> 00:41:22.222]  I have a conscience!
[00:41:22.902 --> 00:41:46.236]  And you sicko yuppies, you filth garbage, you trash of the earth, think it's all funny, so you tune into your sports stations, and you drink your beer, and you go, and you party all day long, and you just think it's all funny and cute, it's all coming back on you, you scumbag police, and you scumbag social workers, and all you people that make excuses and go along with this system, you're going to hell!
[00:41:46.436 --> 00:41:47.076]  You hear me?
[00:41:47.276 --> 00:41:48.317]  You're going to hell!
[00:41:51.491 --> 00:41:53.172]  I'm sorry, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:41:54.533 --> 00:41:56.534]  Look at these photos of these little kids they're killing.
[00:41:57.395 --> 00:41:58.476]  Toddlers, babies.
[00:41:59.937 --> 00:42:00.957]  And I've read the reports.
[00:42:00.977 --> 00:42:01.978]  This has been going on for years.
[00:42:01.998 --> 00:42:03.119]  They'll take a healthy child.
[00:42:04.372 --> 00:42:06.594]  He's not even showing any, quote, symptoms of AIDS.
[00:42:06.694 --> 00:42:07.474]  They're poor mother.
[00:42:07.534 --> 00:42:08.895]  They grab the child, take it away.
[00:42:08.915 --> 00:42:10.156]  Society goes, oh, that's a good thing.
[00:42:10.436 --> 00:42:10.956]  They take him.
[00:42:10.977 --> 00:42:11.417]  They drug him.
[00:42:11.437 --> 00:42:12.658]  The kid's dead in six weeks.
[00:42:12.678 --> 00:42:16.020]  I mean, I read articles every day where CPS gets a kid and they're dead.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.502]  And it goes, oh, they had suddenly gone into the hospital.
[00:42:18.782 --> 00:42:19.482]  Oh, don't worry.
[00:42:19.622 --> 00:42:21.083]  Their organs were taken.
[00:42:21.344 --> 00:42:23.465]  Oh, something good came out of it.
[00:42:23.545 --> 00:42:24.085]  Oh, yes.
[00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:27.511]  And where are the investigative reporters?
[00:42:28.091 --> 00:42:28.771]  Where are you?
[00:42:29.111 --> 00:42:41.416]  Oh, you've got stories about the football bars, and what the yuppies are doing, and the new MP3 players, and your vacations!
[00:42:42.896 --> 00:42:46.077]  You're going to lose your property, you're going to lose your children, you're going to lose everything, folks.
[00:42:46.757 --> 00:42:49.418]  You're going to lose the society, we're losing our children, everything.
[00:42:49.718 --> 00:42:51.279]  It's all falling apart.
[00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:59.251]  You know, I want to bring Debbie Morrow up and then we'll get to your calls and I just got stacks and it's all horrible.
[00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:01.312]  Somebody's got to talk about it.
[00:43:01.592 --> 00:43:02.872]  Somebody's got to expose it.
[00:43:04.492 --> 00:43:05.673]  Somebody's got to stand up.
[00:43:09.113 --> 00:43:10.994]  Man, I tell you, they're doing this all over the place.
[00:43:12.134 --> 00:43:13.955]  It's just stuff you can't imagine!
[00:43:14.355 --> 00:43:20.156]  Much worse than letting black men die of syphilis over 45 years and not giving them treatment and letting them spread it.
[00:43:21.013 --> 00:43:21.673]  That's horrible!
[00:43:21.713 --> 00:43:22.714]  These were adults, though!
[00:43:22.994 --> 00:43:25.355]  It's much worse than letting the troops breed depleted uranium.
[00:43:25.576 --> 00:43:33.700]  It's much worse than giving full-grown men anthrax and smallpox shots, which, by the way, the article's admitting it's killing and naming them.
[00:43:34.621 --> 00:43:35.721]  These are babies!
[00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:37.022]  These are defenseless!
[00:43:39.703 --> 00:43:40.784]  We're in so much trouble.
[00:43:42.054 --> 00:43:52.140]  And by the way, to counteract people like me, when you watch a sitcom or a drama, the bad guy's the person that speaks out against CPS, the one that speaks out against the vaccines, the one that speaks out against the IMF and World Bank.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:44:01.086]  On these shows like 24 and Threat Matrix, they arrest them and they get, and people like me get tortured and millions of people watch them every night, simulating this in their minds.
[00:44:01.406 --> 00:44:05.068]  Oh, if somebody talks about this, the government arrests them and tortures them because they're bad.
[00:44:05.348 --> 00:44:08.810]  This is all code word for being a terrorist, because Alex is evil.
[00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:11.112]  He reads out of the New York Post what they're doing.
[00:44:11.852 --> 00:44:17.954]  I saw 24, I saw Threat Matrix, I saw that episode of Frasier where they talk about New World Order, they're terrorists.
[00:44:18.414 --> 00:44:20.055]  Oh, get him, get him, get him.
[00:44:20.095 --> 00:44:22.016]  I don't have to take responsibility for what's happening.
[00:44:22.196 --> 00:44:23.516]  I can just watch my dramas.
[00:44:23.716 --> 00:44:27.297]  I can watch NYPD Blue and they'll tell me the people that talk like this are bad.
[00:44:27.517 --> 00:44:28.938]  I won't have to take responsibility.
[00:44:29.078 --> 00:44:30.678]  Do you understand the level of evil?
[00:44:33.259 --> 00:44:34.780]  The brainwashing at every level?
[00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:38.228]  We are in hell!
[00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:41.650]  We are in nightmare 1984 world!
[00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.291]  I was on a big liberal syndicated show.
[00:44:44.311 --> 00:44:47.912]  They're like, you're right, the police state bush is bad, but we need this to keep us safe.
[00:44:47.972 --> 00:44:49.693]  And I said, what about cameras in school bathrooms?
[00:44:50.053 --> 00:44:51.353]  Well, there's guns in schools.
[00:44:51.373 --> 00:44:52.634]  You know, we've got to.
[00:44:52.654 --> 00:44:57.156]  You know, we're so brainwashed now that, oh, cameras in bathrooms.
[00:44:57.196 --> 00:44:58.036]  That's good.
[00:44:58.076 --> 00:44:58.416]  That's not 1984.
[00:44:59.336 --> 00:45:00.337]  What's wrong with you?
[00:45:00.357 --> 00:45:01.597]  What happened to us?
[00:45:01.977 --> 00:45:03.418]  What happened to us?
[00:45:07.293 --> 00:45:12.916]  Debbie Morrow, if you want to stop drinking the poison they're putting in the water, let me tell you, you're insane if you drink tap water.
[00:45:14.137 --> 00:45:14.877]  You're nuts.
[00:45:15.938 --> 00:45:18.379]  Oh, I know you saw Dr. Strangelove, I'm a cook for saying that.
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:19.760]  You know, Stanley Kubrick.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:20.561]  I'm weird.
[00:45:20.741 --> 00:45:24.803]  I don't want you drinking fluoride and nickel and mercury and all the garbage.
[00:45:24.923 --> 00:45:25.463]  I'm bad.
[00:45:25.503 --> 00:45:26.824]  The movie says I'm crazy.
[00:45:27.585 --> 00:45:29.746]  The TV says people are nuts and they say
[00:45:30.379 --> 00:45:31.179]  Clean your water!
[00:45:31.699 --> 00:45:32.960]  Listen to me.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.060]  Let's go to Debbie.
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.280]  Don't listen to her either.
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.401]  These are products made in America.
[00:45:37.721 --> 00:45:39.682]  Debbie, tell folks real quick about the specials.
[00:45:42.022 --> 00:45:42.902]  Do we have Debbie with us?
[00:45:44.503 --> 00:45:45.623]  Hi Alex, I'm here.
[00:45:45.643 --> 00:45:47.404]  Sorry about that.
[00:45:48.484 --> 00:45:49.224]  Great to have you with us.
[00:45:49.264 --> 00:45:50.664]  Tell folks about the water filters.
[00:45:51.665 --> 00:45:53.305]  The water filters are great.
[00:45:53.685 --> 00:45:55.206]  They take out the poisons.
[00:45:55.286 --> 00:45:57.366]  Everybody needs one.
[00:45:58.246 --> 00:45:59.987]  You've heard it time and again.
[00:46:00.953 --> 00:46:04.255]  Call New Millennium, get water filters, take control of your life.
[00:46:04.396 --> 00:46:07.798]  You will be healthier by drinking more pure water.
[00:46:07.818 --> 00:46:22.869]  The specials for this month are different than we've ever had before because we have a new CD that we'll be selling and we're going to give it away either a DVD or a VHS with a water filter.
[00:46:22.889 --> 00:46:27.433]  If they get it without the light, they get the free DVD or VHS.
[00:46:27.633 --> 00:46:30.335]  If they get the water filter with the lights and the bass,
[00:46:30.885 --> 00:46:34.448]  They get a sport bottle and the VHS or DVD.
[00:46:34.468 --> 00:46:39.412]  The DVD is called Sheltering in Place and it's really great.
[00:46:39.432 --> 00:46:44.216]  I haven't seen it yet but Jim's talked to me and told me about it and I can't wait to get one.
[00:46:44.877 --> 00:46:53.264]  It's made by a housewife who has learned how to get her house ready in case we did have
[00:46:53.942 --> 00:46:56.304]  Biological or a nuclear problem?
[00:46:56.365 --> 00:46:57.926]  Let's just say it, in case the U.N.
[00:46:57.966 --> 00:47:07.676]  carries out its public plan that they've publicly stated to kill 80% of us, and that's Henry Kissinger's mainstream CIA document, public on InfoWars.
[00:47:07.836 --> 00:47:08.817]  They say they're going to kill you.
[00:47:09.078 --> 00:47:10.079]  I don't know if they're going to try it.
[00:47:10.099 --> 00:47:11.400]  They're certainly gearing up for it.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.721]  You might want to protect yourself.
[00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:16.185]  Right, and this DVD or VHS tape, whichever you want,
[00:47:16.906 --> 00:47:22.970]  You know, not everybody can afford to build an underground shelter, but we can make a safe room in our house.
[00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:24.191]  We can be ready.
[00:47:24.991 --> 00:47:26.412]  But a lot of us don't know how to do it.
[00:47:26.832 --> 00:47:28.654]  How will we get the water into our house?
[00:47:28.734 --> 00:47:30.815]  How will we keep things out?
[00:47:30.995 --> 00:47:35.078]  And this is a step-by-step video on how
[00:47:35.888 --> 00:47:37.269]  I don't think so.
[00:47:58.148 --> 00:47:58.488]  I think so.
[00:48:18.775 --> 00:48:21.298]  And you can mix and match them with a potassium iodate.
[00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:24.661]  Which protects you against radiation, number one cause of death if there is an event.
[00:48:25.162 --> 00:48:25.582]  Absolutely.
[00:48:25.602 --> 00:48:25.682]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:25.762]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:39.352]  And folks, we'll have Debbie back up again this week to detail more about this sheltering in place video.
[00:48:39.392 --> 00:48:40.692]  I heard Jim raving about it.
[00:48:41.072 --> 00:48:42.733]  Really a lot of key information in this.
[00:48:43.653 --> 00:48:45.373]  So that will be offered as well.
[00:48:45.913 --> 00:48:48.814]  So again, 888-803-4438.
[00:48:50.934 --> 00:48:54.455]  And folks, if you call and Debbie's busy, just leave your name and number and she'll call you right back.
[00:48:54.495 --> 00:48:55.515]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[00:48:55.535 --> 00:48:56.555]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:48:56.835 --> 00:48:57.875]  I really appreciate you.
[00:48:58.015 --> 00:49:00.676]  We're going to come back and get into more news and then your calls.
[00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:09.397]  I guess here in the last two minutes of this segment I might mention also that I've made ten films, written a book, published a book, carried some other great books and videos.
[00:49:09.978 --> 00:49:18.184]  I made two films on September 11th and how these murdering demons carried it out to scare you into total submission so they could have their way with us!
[00:49:19.565 --> 00:49:25.269]  Now I've made ten of these videos, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove,
[00:49:26.816 --> 00:49:29.457]  The satanic activities of our Christian conservative leaders, mainly.
[00:49:30.077 --> 00:49:31.177]  You need to get those videos.
[00:49:31.317 --> 00:49:34.097]  They're $25.95, $20 when you order three or more.
[00:49:34.117 --> 00:49:35.838]  They're all over two hours long.
[00:49:35.878 --> 00:49:39.558]  My book, Descent into Tyranny, is only $12, covering what happened on 9-11.
[00:49:40.058 --> 00:49:48.140]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free to order at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:49:54.421 --> 00:49:57.243]  And your purchase also makes this show possible.
[00:49:57.884 --> 00:49:58.804]  So again, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:50:00.065 --> 00:50:10.873]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:50:11.553 --> 00:50:14.135]  And the videos are waking people up.
[00:50:14.755 --> 00:50:15.856]  90% of those that see them are waking up.
[00:50:16.116 --> 00:50:17.257]  You have no excuse, folks.
[00:50:17.317 --> 00:50:20.099]  This is a tool that works, that exposes these criminals.
[00:50:20.379 --> 00:50:21.180]  And it's coming down.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.701]  The tyranny is coming down right now.
[00:50:23.122 --> 00:50:25.844]  Now is the time to expose him and these videos are the best tool.
[00:50:25.864 --> 00:50:30.729]  1-888-253-3139 or PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com So don't wait!
[00:50:30.749 --> 00:50:33.992]  InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or 1-888-253-3139 Don't wait!
[00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:46.981]  Get them!
[00:50:47.382 --> 00:50:48.662]  Get them on Axis Television!
[00:50:48.943 --> 00:50:50.884]  Get them out to public officials and opinion makers!
[00:50:51.364 --> 00:50:56.048]  Only by exposing this military-industrial complex takeover can we stop it!
[00:50:56.348 --> 00:50:57.669]  Things are very desperate!
[00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:59.410]  The enemy is moving upon us!
[00:51:02.386 --> 00:51:06.890]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:11.334]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:51:11.634 --> 00:51:12.175]  We listened.
[00:51:12.495 --> 00:51:17.459]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:18.240]  We listened.
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.663]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:51:22.083 --> 00:51:22.604]  We listened.
[00:51:23.064 --> 00:51:27.127]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:51:27.507 --> 00:51:28.007]  We listened.
[00:51:28.347 --> 00:51:33.571]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:35.352]  Again, we listened.
[00:51:35.712 --> 00:51:43.097]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:51:43.477 --> 00:51:46.939]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[00:51:52.979 --> 00:51:57.221]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:51:57.441 --> 00:51:58.862]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:52:01.583 --> 00:52:08.946]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:13.968]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:52:14.188 --> 00:52:19.831]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:52:20.071 --> 00:52:24.594]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:52:24.814 --> 00:52:31.979]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:52:31.999 --> 00:52:32.779]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:52:32.819 --> 00:52:36.542]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:52:36.702 --> 00:52:39.203]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:52:39.444 --> 00:52:46.148]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:52:46.388 --> 00:52:54.053]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:52:54.253 --> 00:52:58.155]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:53:00.316 --> 00:53:01.857]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:53:01.997 --> 00:53:03.158]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:53:03.318 --> 00:53:06.740]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.280]  Phenol?
[00:53:07.581 --> 00:53:14.665]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:53:15.205 --> 00:53:19.089]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:53:19.209 --> 00:53:19.650]  Fragrance?
[00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:24.795]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:53:24.915 --> 00:53:29.600]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.263]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cowl Bend shampoo.
[00:53:32.643 --> 00:53:36.045]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:53:36.205 --> 00:53:39.767]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:53:39.947 --> 00:53:42.308]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:53:42.468 --> 00:53:43.349]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:53:43.469 --> 00:53:53.214]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Kalben Pure Soaps.
[00:53:53.415 --> 00:53:55.616]  Call Kalben toll free 1-800-340-7091 or visit KalbenPureSoap.com.
[00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:09.575]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.176 --> 00:54:13.178]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:17.782]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:17.802 --> 00:54:23.107]  We're about to start the third hour, and then I'll go straight to Bert and Rod and Tim and John and Regina and Dave.
[00:54:24.208 --> 00:54:25.309]  All the people that I've been holding.
[00:54:26.758 --> 00:54:29.760]  You know, I had a guest on, and I've been going over this other news.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:35.125]  I mean, the federal government says everyone in all schools will be drug tested, no exceptions.
[00:54:35.145 --> 00:54:37.947]  The feds say, we're going to drug test every child in America.
[00:54:38.087 --> 00:54:39.848]  Well, these people ship the trash in.
[00:54:39.868 --> 00:54:41.810]  I already knew it was being federalized.
[00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:45.092]  That's why all the schools are putting it in, but Bush said it in his...
[00:54:47.228 --> 00:54:48.428]  Weekend radio address.
[00:54:49.068 --> 00:54:52.989]  I mean, the federal government says we're going to drug test every child in America.
[00:54:53.510 --> 00:55:03.492]  And I remember two years ago, it was even before 9-11, it was almost three years ago, it's hard to believe it's 2004, watching Army News Watch on local Channel 17.
[00:55:04.072 --> 00:55:09.514]  It still airs every night, five nights a week on Channel 17, the county cable television station.
[00:55:09.554 --> 00:55:10.434]  It's a national show.
[00:55:11.301 --> 00:55:14.423]  And they go, well, you have two employees, or a hundred.
[00:55:15.344 --> 00:55:18.186]  Army or Air Force will drop by and drug test them.
[00:55:18.266 --> 00:55:19.808]  It's part of defending the homeland.
[00:55:20.048 --> 00:55:23.290]  They had Homeland Security set up, by the way, in 1993, covertly.
[00:55:24.711 --> 00:55:26.953]  So, that's the new system.
[00:55:27.583 --> 00:55:43.962]  You see, and now it's, oh, we're going to drug test it, oh, we want to pass laws federally mandated in the states to make you breathalyze to start your car, and oh, we want to, you know, all your cell phones track you and can listen to you, and oh, your OnStar does it, and oh, we want to make it the law to put satellite tracking in your car and tax you and trace you.
[00:55:44.262 --> 00:55:45.764]  It's all happening!
[00:55:47.034 --> 00:55:49.336]  I could talk for hours about this USA Today article.
[00:55:49.656 --> 00:55:53.199]  President uses radio address to push anti-drug proposals.
[00:55:53.599 --> 00:56:00.944]  President Bush preparing to unveil an anti-drug strategy on Saturday championed his budget proposals to increase drug testing in schools.
[00:56:01.284 --> 00:56:01.605]  Federal
[00:56:02.165 --> 00:56:07.887]  Help more communities run prevention programs and pay for treatment through religious groups for more low-income addicts.
[00:56:07.928 --> 00:56:12.429]  That means faith-based initiative, publicly funding the churches to be title-tale arms.
[00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:16.411]  The big Baptist church in Austin already has UN Day, anti-gun grabs.
[00:56:16.671 --> 00:56:18.452]  I mean, I'm living in the twilight zone here.
[00:56:19.412 --> 00:56:20.073]  Oh my goodness.
[00:56:21.676 --> 00:56:36.909]  Anthrax, jabs, blame for baby deaths, Scotsman, sanctions kill 1.5 million Iraqis, mainstream news here from the UN, former CIA, spook promotes legitimizing of ethnic cleansing.
[00:56:37.189 --> 00:56:44.495]  I have the CIA's Voice of America broadcast and they go, well, you know, ethnic cleansing might be good against the Christians in Serbia.
[00:56:45.156 --> 00:56:45.937]  You don't believe me?
[00:56:46.037 --> 00:56:47.077]  It's mainstream news.
[00:56:48.058 --> 00:56:48.739]  Here's another one.
[00:56:50.672 --> 00:56:51.933]  This is the Sunday Morning Herald.
[00:56:52.013 --> 00:56:53.033]  Strange concept.
[00:56:53.073 --> 00:56:56.054]  This car dobs you in the speed camera.
[00:56:57.155 --> 00:57:01.737]  And you have to swipe a card to start the new Toyotas with your identity that satellite tracks you.
[00:57:01.957 --> 00:57:03.377]  Toyota's about to put it on their cars.
[00:57:04.298 --> 00:57:05.738]  There's the article, folks!
[00:57:06.078 --> 00:57:06.999]  There it is!
[00:57:08.039 --> 00:57:09.780]  Bush accused of supporting Haitian rebels.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:11.100]  Of course they stage all this stuff.
[00:57:11.421 --> 00:57:11.641]  U.S.
[00:57:11.681 --> 00:57:13.441]  Pakistan deny bin Laden was captured.
[00:57:13.682 --> 00:57:16.943]  See, they've got the hunt on for him because they're getting near the election.
[00:57:17.223 --> 00:57:19.464]  Gotta stage that event, as I told you two years ago.
[00:57:20.717 --> 00:57:21.417]  We'll get into that.
[00:57:21.457 --> 00:57:25.159]  The Passion brings in 76 to 81 million.
[00:57:25.219 --> 00:57:26.019]  No one's sure.
[00:57:26.039 --> 00:57:28.661]  I've got one AP, one Reuters story from last night.
[00:57:29.221 --> 00:57:34.423]  I don't know, but it's between 78 and 80 plus million, so good.
[00:57:34.503 --> 00:57:35.624]  Shows the truth sells.
[00:57:37.184 --> 00:57:40.566]  Also, whistleblower, FBI agent, Patriot Act is on the right track.
[00:57:40.626 --> 00:57:44.428]  Kathleen Rowley, I told you in my films, in my book, is a shill.
[00:57:44.808 --> 00:57:49.550]  You got real FBI agents coming out that Bush ordered them not to stop Al Qaeda, threatened to arrest them,
[00:57:50.592 --> 00:57:57.478]  Robert Wright and others, and then this shill comes out and goes, yeah, we dropped the ball, we need double funding, we're just stupid.
[00:57:58.058 --> 00:58:06.065]  When she had nothing to do with the cases, and here she is and we're on that daily, oh, the Patriot Act's so good, and I'm the whistleblower, you can trust me.
[00:58:07.025 --> 00:58:07.906]  Classic tactic.
[00:58:08.787 --> 00:58:10.728]  Uh, we'll get into what's gonna happen with Social Security.
[00:58:12.229 --> 00:58:16.413]  Alleged web TV hacker charged with cyber terrorism.
[00:58:17.621 --> 00:58:22.722]  And, uh, FBI agents arrested a Louisiana man last week under the Cyberterrorism Provisions of the Patriot Act.
[00:58:23.242 --> 00:58:31.144]  He sent out a, uh, he hacked into other computers as a practical joke and had the web TV systems dial 9-1-1.
[00:58:31.704 --> 00:58:35.165]  So he doesn't get a trial or a jury or anything because he's a terrorist.
[00:58:36.205 --> 00:58:39.666]  Uh, the Defense Department involved with Walmart and the RFID tags.
[00:58:42.057 --> 00:58:46.743]  Piss out of... I mean, I just got... Folks, the stack is almost a foot tall.
[00:58:47.083 --> 00:58:48.365]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:58:48.605 --> 00:58:49.146]  We'll be back.
[00:58:51.215 --> 00:58:52.796]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.197 --> 00:58:58.921]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:58:59.181 --> 00:59:04.305]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:59:04.646 --> 00:59:13.933]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:59:14.273 --> 00:59:19.235]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:59:19.555 --> 00:59:23.556]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:59:23.776 --> 00:59:28.498]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:59:28.898 --> 00:59:34.800]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:44.188]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:59:44.388 --> 00:59:48.131]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:48.451 --> 00:59:49.592]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:57.298 --> 00:59:57.939]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.599 --> 00:59:59.680]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.361 --> 01:00:01.522]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.122 --> 01:00:02.923]  You want answers?
[01:00:03.681 --> 01:00:04.581]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:08.883]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.423 --> 01:00:13.544]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.305 --> 01:00:18.646]  Don't hurt the little children.
[01:00:18.806 --> 01:00:19.466]  Suffer them.
[01:00:20.286 --> 01:00:21.186]  Take care of them.
[01:00:21.226 --> 01:00:26.108]  It'd be better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw yourself into the ocean.
[01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:29.149]  Paraphrasing Jesus Christ,
[01:00:29.853 --> 01:00:34.777]  By the way, I just said that as of yesterday, The Passion made somewhere around 80 plus million.
[01:00:35.237 --> 01:00:39.360]  Stephanie just said that somebody called in saying ABC News reported 115 million.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.541]  Well, yeah, that'd be on track for today now.
[01:00:42.402 --> 01:00:46.965]  Which is great news, because, you know, people want wholesomeness.
[01:00:47.005 --> 01:00:49.547]  They want to see goodness upheld.
[01:00:50.268 --> 01:00:51.268]  They want reality.
[01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:52.129]  They want history.
[01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.611]  They don't want all the mindless, gratuitous violence.
[01:00:55.031 --> 01:00:56.012]  They want reality.
[01:00:56.818 --> 01:01:06.967]  And it shows that despite the New World Order's attack on this film, and their total boycott of it, that it's on track to be in the top three biggest grossing films ever.
[01:01:08.488 --> 01:01:13.473]  So, next to Titanic and Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King.
[01:01:14.073 --> 01:01:15.915]  Which, both of those are pretty good movies, by the way.
[01:01:16.815 --> 01:01:19.698]  But people like to see that good and evil thing going.
[01:01:20.792 --> 01:01:23.795]  Uh, but, uh, most moving movie I've ever seen.
[01:01:23.816 --> 01:01:25.798]  I don't, I've never cried in movies.
[01:01:25.838 --> 01:01:26.839]  I did cry during this one.
[01:01:26.979 --> 01:01:31.103]  And, uh, I was just talking to Stephanie during the break, the lady that runs the show.
[01:01:31.123 --> 01:01:34.847]  Uh, she was moved to tears during it and thought it was a wonderful film.
[01:01:35.989 --> 01:01:37.951]  It was some idiot talk show host this weekend.
[01:01:39.346 --> 01:01:41.869]  Locally going, Mel Gibson just put this violence in there to make money.
[01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:44.111]  You should have taken the violence out.
[01:01:44.271 --> 01:01:48.696]  That's like saying you should not show a History Channel show about the concentration camps.
[01:01:48.937 --> 01:01:53.662]  Don't show those piles of dead bodies being pushed into mass graves by bulldozers.
[01:01:54.771 --> 01:01:55.952]  Naked, dead people.
[01:01:56.172 --> 01:01:57.173]  Men, women, and children.
[01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:58.594]  Horrible, emaciated bodies.
[01:01:59.114 --> 01:02:00.095]  You have to see that.
[01:02:00.556 --> 01:02:01.876]  Nobody says, don't show that.
[01:02:02.217 --> 01:02:05.619]  But oh, suddenly Hollywood, don't, don't, don't show this.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:06.640]  Don't show that.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.343]  It's like having a movie like Roots or something and saying, don't show the black person getting whipped.
[01:02:11.504 --> 01:02:13.125]  Why don't you take that out?
[01:02:13.185 --> 01:02:14.786]  And by the way, he was a black commentator.
[01:02:14.826 --> 01:02:15.747]  I brought that up to him.
[01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:18.889]  Oh, that's different.
[01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.930]  Oh, it's different, huh?
[01:02:21.551 --> 01:02:22.892]  I mean, it's just a sick joke.
[01:02:24.135 --> 01:02:30.101]  But, you know, speaking of taking care of the little children, I became physically ill reading this this morning.
[01:02:30.641 --> 01:02:46.996]  New York Post, the CPS, grabs people's children, takes some that don't have AIDS, some that do, some that don't even have HIV, give them deadly drugs that kill them, that's right here in the article, give them multiple vaccines that aren't even for AIDS, just see how many vaccines they can give a newborn baby.
[01:02:47.822 --> 01:02:49.743]  That's what happens when CPS grabs your kids.
[01:02:50.003 --> 01:02:52.243]  And I've seen articles all over the country concerning this.
[01:02:52.283 --> 01:02:53.304]  This is what they do.
[01:02:53.704 --> 01:02:55.965]  You're five times more likely to die in their custody.
[01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:56.925]  No one's more abusive.
[01:02:56.965 --> 01:02:57.645]  No one's worse.
[01:02:58.205 --> 01:02:58.925]  Statistically.
[01:02:59.005 --> 01:03:01.626]  But again, you have the Fox Guard in the head house.
[01:03:01.806 --> 01:03:02.767]  So what's the Fox do?
[01:03:03.307 --> 01:03:04.527]  These are sick predators.
[01:03:05.007 --> 01:03:07.748]  And Big Pharma, of course, are the ones funding all this.
[01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:11.869]  And now they've got 10 million kids on Ritalin and Prozac.
[01:03:11.909 --> 01:03:12.830]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:14.790]  They can just kidnap your kids and do stuff to them.
[01:03:14.810 --> 01:03:16.831]  I mean, the level of evil here is indescribable.
[01:03:18.186 --> 01:03:21.707]  So we'll go over that and also I want to get your comments on Bush's radio address.
[01:03:21.727 --> 01:03:24.108]  He wants all school children drug tested.
[01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:29.630]  You know, everyone guilty until proven innocent while him and his daddy ship in the narcotics.
[01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:31.270]  That's public knowledge.
[01:03:31.871 --> 01:03:34.111]  Anthrax jabs blamed for killing babies.
[01:03:34.512 --> 01:03:35.112]  The Scotsman.
[01:03:35.432 --> 01:03:36.492]  I got stacks of these.
[01:03:36.692 --> 01:03:37.413]  Stacks of these.
[01:03:37.973 --> 01:03:42.874]  But first when we get back we'll go to Bert and Rod and John and Regina and Dave.
[01:03:43.555 --> 01:03:44.215]  There's a big
[01:03:46.565 --> 01:03:56.008]  I think it's important that people finally understand, a picture tells a thousand words, John Kerry basically worshipping Anton LaVey, fawning on him.
[01:03:57.388 --> 01:04:03.330]  I mean, you'd think Anton LaVey was a bombshell blonde or something, the way Kerry's fawning over him.
[01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:12.072]  And it's Kerry and Anton LaVey meeting in San Francisco, a big pentagram behind them, one of their little functions.
[01:04:12.979 --> 01:04:16.460]  You know, it's when Marilyn Monroe does it, or Sammy Davis Jr.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.821]  It's all cute, it's funny, and it's just for fun.
[01:04:18.841 --> 01:04:20.082]  You know, like Bush at Skull and Bones.
[01:04:20.382 --> 01:04:21.682]  Ah, the Satanism's just for fun.
[01:04:21.702 --> 01:04:22.263]  You know how it is.
[01:04:22.783 --> 01:04:24.103]  Very Christian, very conservative.
[01:04:24.143 --> 01:04:25.444]  I'm evil and liberal because I'm against it.
[01:04:25.984 --> 01:04:27.165]  I'm pro-gun, I'm liberal too.
[01:04:27.185 --> 01:04:27.805]  You know how that works.
[01:04:27.825 --> 01:04:30.566]  Now if you're from big government, gun control at borders, you're conservative.
[01:04:30.826 --> 01:04:35.328]  But this is, of course, you've got a real live Satanist meeting with a carnival huckster Satanist.
[01:04:35.388 --> 01:04:37.308]  I mean, of course you're going to have a love fest.
[01:04:40.347 --> 01:04:46.354]  Kerry, I got the quote here, said I have no problem with Anton LaVey, I believe we all have deity inside of us, and all religions are good.
[01:04:47.455 --> 01:04:49.897]  Then he said, oh yes, this is the essence of Satanism.
[01:04:50.638 --> 01:04:51.199]  Yes, I'm on.
[01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:59.007]  Maka is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[01:04:59.387 --> 01:05:03.470]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:11.176]  Only recently has science discovered that Maka is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[01:05:11.736 --> 01:05:19.084]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[01:05:19.424 --> 01:05:21.687]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[01:05:22.007 --> 01:05:25.271]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:28.834]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[01:05:29.135 --> 01:05:32.038]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[01:05:32.518 --> 01:05:37.644]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match.
[01:05:37.784 --> 01:05:40.688]  Because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[01:05:41.128 --> 01:05:42.610]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings.
[01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:44.432]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[01:05:52.811 --> 01:06:03.540]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:11.287]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:06:11.587 --> 01:06:14.690]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:20.692]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:06:20.992 --> 01:06:27.154]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:06:27.514 --> 01:06:31.395]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:33.316]  The water level is always visible.
[01:06:33.536 --> 01:06:39.461]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:06:39.701 --> 01:06:47.848]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:06:51.531 --> 01:06:56.936]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:06:57.116 --> 01:07:01.460]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:07:04.224 --> 01:07:06.065]  This disaster is a New World Order.
[01:07:06.166 --> 01:07:07.487]  A New World Order?
[01:07:08.187 --> 01:07:08.868]  Can't imagine.
[01:07:09.228 --> 01:07:13.451]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:07:13.512 --> 01:07:20.437]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:07:20.577 --> 01:07:22.579]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:07:22.819 --> 01:07:33.265]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:07:33.565 --> 01:07:38.928]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:07:58.834 --> 01:07:59.875]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:00.595 --> 01:08:01.716]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.357 --> 01:08:03.177]  You want answers?
[01:08:03.938 --> 01:08:04.838]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.499 --> 01:08:09.342]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.682 --> 01:08:13.805]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:16.147 --> 01:08:21.230]  Just a note here of importance that will go straight to your calls, I promise.
[01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:23.492]  Then back in the news, and we've got other guests coming up.
[01:08:25.757 --> 01:08:34.803]  Got a call at about ten o'clock this morning, about an hour before I went on air, and then of course we had Casey Nutter caught on from Ranch Rescue.
[01:08:34.843 --> 01:08:41.487]  The governor has publicly said under the Patriot Act, they're just going to arrest him without charges for running Camp Thunderbird, exposing the illegal aliens.
[01:08:42.027 --> 01:08:47.830]  With Ranch Rescue in Arizona, where two million illegals come across yearly in Cochise County alone, that's the Fed Zone numbers.
[01:08:48.771 --> 01:08:50.112]  John Stapmiller called me.
[01:08:50.632 --> 01:08:51.973]  You know, I'm friends with John.
[01:08:52.013 --> 01:08:55.395]  John has his own show, weeknights here on the station, on the network.
[01:08:56.627 --> 01:08:59.148]  I quit doing the Saturday Show with John just because I'm too busy.
[01:08:59.208 --> 01:09:00.089]  I'm doing all these interviews.
[01:09:00.129 --> 01:09:00.749]  I'm exhausted.
[01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:03.390]  I've already done two interviews this morning.
[01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:04.351]  I do more tonight.
[01:09:04.851 --> 01:09:05.951]  I'm making a film.
[01:09:07.272 --> 01:09:14.936]  But John called me, and a testament to John, and he said, hey, Casey Nethercott needs your help.
[01:09:15.916 --> 01:09:21.219]  By the time I get on air today, he's going to already be in jail, having to turn himself in of the National Guard.
[01:09:21.239 --> 01:09:23.600]  He's going to come into Camp Thunderbird there on the border.
[01:09:24.483 --> 01:09:32.307]  Where they're simply peaceably getting shot at by the Mexican troops, not firing back, and videotaping the Mexican troops drug dealing and the rest of it.
[01:09:33.328 --> 01:09:34.529]  Bringing the drugs across.
[01:09:35.049 --> 01:09:37.590]  They've killed federal officers in the area, the Mexican troops have.
[01:09:38.891 --> 01:09:42.613]  So, Johnson, oh by the way, in a recent also, my dad died this morning.
[01:09:43.847 --> 01:09:44.507]  At 8 o'clock.
[01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:45.688]  Here's John.
[01:09:45.728 --> 01:09:47.208]  I just learned his dad died.
[01:09:47.848 --> 01:09:51.969]  And then he's busy calling me so I can have Casey Nethercott on.
[01:09:52.389 --> 01:09:54.290]  Of course, John didn't know I was going to say this on the air.
[01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:57.330]  I don't even know if he wanted me to.
[01:09:57.831 --> 01:09:59.371]  We really care about this fight.
[01:09:59.451 --> 01:10:00.631]  I am upset.
[01:10:01.492 --> 01:10:05.473]  Many mornings, many evenings, when I get on the news wires, I read what they're doing to us.
[01:10:05.593 --> 01:10:06.793]  I read the legislation.
[01:10:07.633 --> 01:10:11.074]  Then I have to watch them talk about how they're our saviors and how much they love us.
[01:10:11.678 --> 01:10:19.921]  You got all these well-meaning cops and people in government who aren't evil, but carry out the evil actions of their masters, but no one's more evil than those running this government.
[01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:21.482]  I mean, it's hellish, man!
[01:10:21.522 --> 01:10:23.303]  They gotta be brought to justice!
[01:10:23.843 --> 01:10:25.584]  I'm upset about what's happening!
[01:10:26.224 --> 01:10:27.944]  I'm trying to telegraph that to you.
[01:10:29.185 --> 01:10:31.646]  I mean, if you aren't upset, something's wrong with you.
[01:10:32.126 --> 01:10:33.987]  Burt, in Louisiana, go ahead.
[01:10:34.007 --> 01:10:35.207]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:10:35.267 --> 01:10:38.949]  I want to thank you for all the good work you're doing out there, and send John my condolences.
[01:10:40.129 --> 01:10:46.095]  And I have a suggestion for the man out of Arizona that he has to turn himself in at 2.30 today.
[01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:55.104]  I suggest that he calls the media and on the courthouse steps have a news conference and exposes Patriot Act as what it is.
[01:10:56.545 --> 01:11:02.491]  I think that if he has a conference there on the courthouse steps with elections like they are today,
[01:11:03.035 --> 01:11:06.977]  And expose it to Patriot, it'll get through millions of people here in America.
[01:11:06.997 --> 01:11:07.817]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:11:07.877 --> 01:11:15.541]  He should, he should, he should call all the media, have them there when he turns himself in, and notice they're saying, turn yourself in or we're coming with troops.
[01:11:15.942 --> 01:11:17.482]  They want to have a confrontation.
[01:11:17.743 --> 01:11:19.904]  Oh yes, oh yes, that's what our government's all about.
[01:11:20.884 --> 01:11:23.586]  And another thing, Alex, I live here in Louisiana.
[01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:26.367]  My wife had dropped my son, 15 years old,
[01:11:27.023 --> 01:11:30.284]  I'll get the DMV to take a driver's permit test.
[01:11:30.344 --> 01:11:34.085]  Well, she went to work and got a phone call and they called her back into the office.
[01:11:34.105 --> 01:11:41.968]  She had to come to the office to verbally give consent for my son to sign up for the military at 15 years old.
[01:11:42.546 --> 01:11:44.127]  Otherwise, he can't get his driver's license.
[01:11:44.147 --> 01:11:45.749]  Yeah, the feds have increased the funding.
[01:11:45.849 --> 01:11:57.599]  Also, look out, don't sign the organ donor card, because statistically, some of these hospitals will kill you for your organs, just like the CPS does here in America with these babies they're murdering.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.282]  Well, Alex, I try my best to pay it forward.
[01:12:00.442 --> 01:12:01.923]  By the way, I'm not joking about that.
[01:12:01.983 --> 01:12:05.827]  CPS will grab your children, will kill them, and take their innards.
[01:12:06.463 --> 01:12:06.803]  I haven't.
[01:12:07.124 --> 01:12:08.725]  I know, I had articles on that last week.
[01:12:08.765 --> 01:12:12.668]  They grab your kid, suddenly they're sick, suddenly they die, and oops, we took the organs!
[01:12:12.888 --> 01:12:13.309]  Ha ha!
[01:12:13.469 --> 01:12:13.889]  Ha ha!
[01:12:14.269 --> 01:12:15.370]  Well, can I ask you a question?
[01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:16.391]  We are in hell!
[01:12:16.531 --> 01:12:17.552]  We are in hell!
[01:12:17.852 --> 01:12:20.875]  And as soon as we start admitting it, we can set about fixing it!
[01:12:21.235 --> 01:12:26.880]  Can you get, somehow, get yourself to expose yourself to the mainstream somehow?
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.241]  Because these people are so...
[01:12:30.243 --> 01:12:31.644]  I am killing myself.
[01:12:31.904 --> 01:12:34.686]  I am doing interviews morning, noon, and night.
[01:12:35.186 --> 01:12:38.348]  I'm doing interviews at 4 in the morning and at 6 a.m.
[01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:42.471]  I'm doing interviews, you know, driving here to the studio via my cell phone.
[01:12:43.252 --> 01:12:46.954]  I have to go around the country on talk stations and I've reached tens of millions of people.
[01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:49.476]  And the website reaches millions.
[01:12:50.016 --> 01:12:51.457]  I'm helping you, Alex.
[01:12:51.998 --> 01:12:52.698]  You're awesome.
[01:12:52.838 --> 01:12:53.719]  You're awesome, Bert.
[01:12:55.836 --> 01:12:58.997]  We have to expose this is what it is, and you know my, here's my theory.
[01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:04.738]  Now I think we can get rid of all these congressmen and all these senators and I think that the people might have to go to the polls.
[01:13:05.018 --> 01:13:09.940]  I'll keep them open 24 hours a day, but let the American people vote on our laws.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.901]  Alright, well listen, I appreciate the call.
[01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:17.522]  What we've got to do is relearn the Bill of Rights and Constitution and get back to those basics.
[01:13:17.982 --> 01:13:21.783]  And we've got to restrict the size of government, because government's always going to be tyrannical.
[01:13:22.819 --> 01:13:27.801]  Just if it's really big, it's going to be able to affect you at the microscopic level.
[01:13:28.841 --> 01:13:29.281]  Okay?
[01:13:29.801 --> 01:13:31.182]  So, that's what's happening.
[01:13:31.222 --> 01:13:36.364]  We've got to restrict the size of government, then the control freaks up there won't have the power to run our lives.
[01:13:37.904 --> 01:13:38.784]  Rod in Texas.
[01:13:38.864 --> 01:13:39.645]  Rod, you're on the air.
[01:13:39.685 --> 01:13:40.125]  Go ahead.
[01:13:40.865 --> 01:13:45.807]  Yeah, Alex, I'm about ready to raise your blood pressure about ten points, so be prepared.
[01:13:45.827 --> 01:13:49.908]  I am very disappointed in you, to be honest with you.
[01:13:49.928 --> 01:13:52.109]  I've been listening to you for about ten years.
[01:13:52.884 --> 01:13:56.668]  In my opinion of you has really gone downhill and here's why.
[01:13:57.830 --> 01:14:03.336]  What I've been hearing from you is a lot of talk, talking the talk, but not walking the walk.
[01:14:03.556 --> 01:14:05.018]  Sure, I don't do enough like you do.
[01:14:05.038 --> 01:14:06.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:11.325]  You got all the answers, you get out there and you bust your... Yes, I do.
[01:14:11.345 --> 01:14:12.547]  I absolutely do.
[01:14:13.024 --> 01:14:14.146]  Okay, good.
[01:14:14.166 --> 01:14:15.628]  Let me finish, let me finish.
[01:14:15.648 --> 01:14:16.129]  Put him on hold.
[01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:17.691]  Look, it isn't about Alex Jones, okay?
[01:14:24.987 --> 01:14:27.428]  And I've helped defeat legislation in the state.
[01:14:28.108 --> 01:14:30.749]  I've helped support those that are in trouble and get them out of trouble.
[01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:32.530]  I've done the best I can.
[01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:33.870]  I've never said I was perfect.
[01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:35.851]  Okay, let me tell you... No, no, I'm putting him back on hold.
[01:14:36.231 --> 01:14:41.793]  But people that call in and say, I'm not good, I'm not doing enough, frankly I think that's a sick joke.
[01:14:41.813 --> 01:14:43.513]  So you've got about another minute left.
[01:14:43.533 --> 01:14:43.834]  Go ahead.
[01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:52.837]  What you're doing is you're acting like a sportscaster at a game and all you're doing is you're narrating and you're analyzing the game.
[01:14:52.917 --> 01:14:53.677]  You're not a leader.
[01:14:54.468 --> 01:14:55.229]  You're not a leader.
[01:14:55.309 --> 01:14:55.809]  Absolutely.
[01:14:55.849 --> 01:14:57.590]  I've never said that I want to be your leader.
[01:14:57.890 --> 01:14:59.952]  No, I didn't say that.
[01:14:59.972 --> 01:15:00.752]  Put him back on hold.
[01:15:00.832 --> 01:15:01.573]  Put him back on hold.
[01:15:03.074 --> 01:15:04.955]  Understand, I've said I'm about information.
[01:15:04.995 --> 01:15:07.016]  The people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:15:08.317 --> 01:15:14.001]  All I'm trying to do is chronicle the outrages so you will become upset and be a leader.
[01:15:14.694 --> 01:15:16.815]  I've said you can forget the presidency.
[01:15:17.156 --> 01:15:21.258]  John Forbes, Kerry, George W. Bush, their cousins, members of the same cult.
[01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:22.559]  It's a staged event.
[01:15:23.039 --> 01:15:31.424]  I've said the solution is at the county and the city and the state level and it's for you to get up off your hind end so you don't have any excuses
[01:15:32.293 --> 01:15:38.857]  You know, you can't say it's my fault we're in this trouble when I'm here simply trying to wake people up.
[01:15:39.137 --> 01:15:54.246]  So you're frustrated, you're mad about the state of affairs, and so now it's my fault we had committees of correspondence in this country for a decade leading up to 1776 that exposed what our rights were, how they were being violated, and who was doing it.
[01:15:54.646 --> 01:15:55.667]  I am chronicling
[01:15:56.207 --> 01:15:57.768]  The outrageous.
[01:15:57.808 --> 01:16:00.729]  Just like the jungle chronicled the abusers in the factories.
[01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:07.152]  You have to educate people about evils so they will then rise up and stand against it.
[01:16:07.452 --> 01:16:10.674]  And my message is to tell others to stand up and spread the word.
[01:16:10.934 --> 01:16:12.755]  And I've never seen people as receptive.
[01:16:12.955 --> 01:16:14.816]  I've never seen people waking up like this.
[01:16:15.016 --> 01:16:17.697]  And how dare you say I'm not doing a good job.
[01:16:18.297 --> 01:16:19.218]  That's ridiculous.
[01:16:19.258 --> 01:16:20.298]  Now go ahead, buddy.
[01:16:20.478 --> 01:16:22.399]  You tell us what you've done.
[01:16:22.639 --> 01:16:23.199]  No, no, no.
[01:16:23.239 --> 01:16:23.900]  Put him back on hold.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:24.640]  No.
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:26.181]  You tell us what you've done.
[01:16:26.521 --> 01:16:30.243]  You tell us how you... I'm sure you've got some magical legal thing you do, right?
[01:16:31.144 --> 01:16:32.445]  You tell us how you're saving us.
[01:16:32.845 --> 01:16:34.646]  Let me give you a real-time example.
[01:16:34.726 --> 01:16:37.748]  Casey called up, and he was pleading for help.
[01:16:38.788 --> 01:16:45.392]  If we had a militia, if we really had a militia, and you supported the militia... You mean a bunch of feds trying to frame other people?
[01:16:46.713 --> 01:16:48.534]  Well, about him being taken in.
[01:16:48.994 --> 01:16:50.315]  And we got something like
[01:16:50.905 --> 01:16:54.826]  Mark Corky advised or advocated the Mob Bucket Brigade.
[01:16:54.946 --> 01:16:56.927]  He had 10,000 people out there.
[01:16:57.247 --> 01:17:09.731]  Yes, let's have the confrontation, but you will never say that because you're walking the fine line, because you don't want to be shut down, because you're milking everything you can, because this is your
[01:17:10.546 --> 01:17:12.147]  Well, it is.
[01:17:12.588 --> 01:17:13.208]  It is my job.
[01:17:13.248 --> 01:17:13.608]  Thank you.
[01:17:14.049 --> 01:17:14.689]  Thanks for the call.
[01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:16.771]  And let me answer this idiot.
[01:17:16.931 --> 01:17:18.452]  I'm going to call you an idiot.
[01:17:18.752 --> 01:17:21.034]  I just don't appreciate you saying those things to me.
[01:17:22.415 --> 01:17:24.097]  Again, he's not mad about the New World Order.
[01:17:24.757 --> 01:17:27.759]  And you notice he's sitting there saying, get violent.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.521]  Well, it's free country, buddy.
[01:17:30.956 --> 01:17:31.496]  Free country!
[01:17:32.036 --> 01:17:32.537]  Free country!
[01:17:32.917 --> 01:17:34.597]  I sat there and I watched the militias.
[01:17:35.097 --> 01:17:42.560]  And every time I went to try to stop something or fix something, they were there, always some fed leading it, promoting it, trying to cause a crisis.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:49.562]  And then you'd have some peaceful group, you know, defeating laws, getting things done, the militias saying, you better stop that.
[01:17:50.022 --> 01:17:53.523]  You'd have well-meaning people who were members of it getting burned, getting set up.
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:54.980]  Okay?
[01:17:55.281 --> 01:18:02.645]  You know, I'm not going to sit around a campfire in camouflage and talk about how tough I am and how I'm an admiral or a general or something.
[01:18:03.786 --> 01:18:06.928]  And I'm not walking some fine line.
[01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:10.551]  I really believe that violence is not the answer.
[01:18:11.631 --> 01:18:14.533]  At this point, I believe defensively it is a good thing.
[01:18:14.854 --> 01:18:18.456]  I believe the Second Amendment is an insurance policy and holds the globalists back.
[01:18:18.796 --> 01:18:24.240]  But you can sit there and shoot your mouth off about, you need to get the militia up in case you never caught.
[01:18:25.437 --> 01:18:30.340]  Okay, and then have a bunch of people run out there and have a bunch of tanks come in and have a war start?
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.122]  And then they've got their excuse to prematurely defeat our counter-revolution?
[01:18:35.662 --> 01:18:38.864]  The feds have to blow things up, buddy, and blame it on us!
[01:18:39.404 --> 01:18:40.905]  What do you think Oklahoma City was?
[01:18:40.985 --> 01:18:44.926]  They control the dominant media, and they're able to blame it on innocent people!
[01:18:46.807 --> 01:18:47.828]  Don't you understand that?
[01:18:47.888 --> 01:18:48.968]  We don't want violence.
[01:18:49.208 --> 01:18:51.089]  We're waking the police and military up.
[01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:54.331]  We've never had such an effect as we're having now.
[01:18:56.005 --> 01:18:57.045]  We're winning this fight!
[01:18:57.786 --> 01:19:00.007]  And we do have our Second Amendment to fall back on.
[01:19:01.287 --> 01:19:04.628]  So, so, and no, you didn't raise my blood pressure, and you know what?
[01:19:05.869 --> 01:19:10.811]  You sit here and tell me I'm bad because I make videos and tell people to make copies of them.
[01:19:10.831 --> 01:19:13.212]  You hit my videos and make as many copies as you can.
[01:19:14.372 --> 01:19:15.432]  That's sick, man.
[01:19:15.473 --> 01:19:16.673]  That's really sick.
[01:19:16.793 --> 01:19:24.536]  As if, as if an author or somebody shouldn't, I mean, how, how, okay, let's say I can send out a hundred free videos, then I'd be broke,
[01:19:25.673 --> 01:19:30.335]  And then there wouldn't be any shortwave or any internet or any of it.
[01:19:30.355 --> 01:19:35.317]  I mean, how do you propose I pay for the 8 million visitors to my website each month?
[01:19:35.577 --> 01:19:37.418]  How do you propose I send the videos out?
[01:19:37.438 --> 01:19:38.198]  I'm not a rich man.
[01:19:38.778 --> 01:19:40.459]  Oh, just do it for free or you're bad.
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:45.041]  And naked copies, you know, that's not enough.
[01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:45.741]  You're bad.
[01:19:45.801 --> 01:19:49.423]  Just, just, just, I'm gonna sit here, you go do something violent for me or you're bad.
[01:19:49.443 --> 01:19:49.903]  That's what he said.
[01:19:52.975 --> 01:19:53.395]  Gold.
[01:19:53.755 --> 01:19:55.036]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:55.296 --> 01:20:01.379]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:01.559 --> 01:20:05.381]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:05.741 --> 01:20:07.642]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:20:07.682 --> 01:20:09.963]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:10.123 --> 01:20:17.187]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:20:17.227 --> 01:20:17.868]  We're good to go.
[01:20:35.208 --> 01:20:35.528]  Thank you.
[01:20:53.251 --> 01:20:55.312]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[01:20:55.473 --> 01:20:57.134]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot!
[01:20:57.254 --> 01:21:05.239]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[01:21:05.479 --> 01:21:11.923]  Imagine, hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[01:21:12.103 --> 01:21:13.344]  Just a few of the many selections.
[01:21:13.544 --> 01:21:16.887]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[01:21:17.067 --> 01:21:20.690]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:26.375]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[01:21:26.675 --> 01:21:29.377]  It makes sense to be prepared and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[01:21:29.577 --> 01:21:33.601]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking or canoeing.
[01:21:33.821 --> 01:21:34.702]  No fires allowed?

[01:21:54.149 --> 01:22:04.855]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:22:05.235 --> 01:22:09.758]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:22:09.818 --> 01:22:21.164]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:22:21.744 --> 01:22:28.611]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:22:28.991 --> 01:22:31.133]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:22:31.633 --> 01:22:36.598]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[01:22:48.469 --> 01:22:48.510]  888-803-4438.
[01:22:53.806 --> 01:22:59.728]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[01:23:09.091 --> 01:23:09.752]  We're good to go!
[01:23:38.610 --> 01:23:41.711]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:23:41.871 --> 01:23:47.812]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[01:23:58.793 --> 01:24:02.714]  Alright my friends, we're about to go back to John, Regina, Dave, Jack, Elizabeth and others.
[01:24:03.614 --> 01:24:06.155]  We've got Paul Watson coming up to give us a bunch of different news items.
[01:24:06.175 --> 01:24:07.635]  Believe me, it's a huge news day.
[01:24:08.999 --> 01:24:14.263]  Tons of stuff we haven't even gotten to yet, but, you know, that was an important call, and I shouldn't have gotten so mad at him.
[01:24:14.283 --> 01:24:18.987]  It's just the name-calling and the accusations that are so untrue make me very upset.
[01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:25.673]  Because, you know, I don't get on the show and ask for donations like most patriot broadcasters do, even though they need it.
[01:24:27.274 --> 01:24:32.598]  You know, a global shortwave a month cost us over $7,000, and I pay that.
[01:24:32.779 --> 01:24:36.882]  You know, our AM and FM stations just pick us up, and we share the advertising with them, and that's the network.
[01:24:37.719 --> 01:24:40.341]  I think the phone bill is like $10,000 a month just for the network.
[01:24:40.721 --> 01:24:42.362]  I don't pay that, but it's hard for Ted to.
[01:24:42.382 --> 01:24:45.023]  You know, we don't have David Rockefeller funding us.
[01:24:45.063 --> 01:24:50.526]  We don't have Pepsi and General Electric advertising with us.
[01:24:51.347 --> 01:24:57.170]  But to call in and say, you know, we need to get violent and go ahead and have the confrontation, but he wants me to do it.
[01:24:57.190 --> 01:24:57.710]  You notice that?
[01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:58.611]  I'm a coward.
[01:24:59.111 --> 01:25:00.392]  I'm a sportscaster.
[01:25:00.492 --> 01:25:02.613]  I'm on the sidelines because I haven't gone and done it.
[01:25:03.214 --> 01:25:04.455]  You know, he's over there.
[01:25:04.755 --> 01:25:05.636]  He hasn't done it.
[01:25:06.316 --> 01:25:10.939]  Why don't you call back in later when we get an open phone line, Rod.
[01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:12.781]  And actually, I want to have a discussion with you.
[01:25:13.301 --> 01:25:16.623]  I just got frustrated because I've got a bunch of callers ahead of me and a guest and a bunch of news.
[01:25:17.304 --> 01:25:20.286]  And explain to me why you are now doing this.
[01:25:21.096 --> 01:25:23.117]  But it's just bad because I am.
[01:25:23.497 --> 01:25:27.198]  Because I've gone out and protested at abortion clinics and been threatened to be arrested.
[01:25:27.658 --> 01:25:28.519]  And police shoved me.
[01:25:28.559 --> 01:25:32.760]  Or I've been arrested for protesting thumb scanning and biometrics at the state police.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.601]  Or I've gone at the checkpoints and gotten in police's faces.
[01:25:36.021 --> 01:25:41.625]  Or I've been chased by Delta Force through the woods, through swamps, with doom buggies chasing me and black helicopters overhead.
[01:25:42.105 --> 01:25:49.610]  Or, yeah, that's right, or I snuck into Bohemian Grove with the Secret Service on my tail and watched world leaders engage in a satanic ceremony.
[01:25:49.971 --> 01:25:51.332]  Oh yeah, I haven't done anything.
[01:25:51.812 --> 01:25:53.713]  I'm trying to expose the evil!
[01:25:54.214 --> 01:25:56.035]  I totally believe in what I'm doing!
[01:25:57.136 --> 01:26:03.560]  And if I thought for a minute, marching out and having an armed conflict with the globalists was the answer, at this point in time, believing I'd do it.
[01:26:04.474 --> 01:26:07.796]  That's ridiculous, but you sit there and say, you haven't done anything!
[01:26:08.136 --> 01:26:09.216]  You haven't done anything!
[01:26:09.496 --> 01:26:11.477]  You need to go out and have an armed conflict!
[01:26:11.698 --> 01:26:26.845]  When I, I, this is the venue so Casey Nethercott can get on the air and talk to people in Denver, Colorado, and Austin, Texas, and Rochester, New York, and Kansas City, Missouri, and Pensacola, Florida, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Los Angeles, California!
[01:26:29.025 --> 01:26:29.847]  See, it's not good enough.
[01:26:29.867 --> 01:26:31.911]  You're not mad at Peter Jennings or Dan Rather.
[01:26:31.931 --> 01:26:33.213]  You know, you just accept that.
[01:26:33.394 --> 01:26:34.957]  But, oh, I'm this peer.
[01:26:35.097 --> 01:26:36.239]  I'm this guy on the radio.
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.384]  Oh, you know, I should do more.
[01:26:39.365 --> 01:26:40.929]  Your argument's nuts, man!
[01:26:42.705 --> 01:26:43.766]  And so you're not too worried?
[01:26:43.786 --> 01:26:44.366]  I guess it's all right.
[01:26:44.386 --> 01:26:45.107]  I'm just the bad one.
[01:26:45.127 --> 01:26:47.508]  You're not worried about them grabbing kids and drugging them or whatever?
[01:26:47.749 --> 01:26:49.590]  You're not worried about them grabbing all these, doing all this?
[01:26:50.010 --> 01:26:53.713]  No, no, the answer is strutting around in camo and getting framed and thrown in prison.
[01:26:54.033 --> 01:26:54.853]  Well, no thank you.
[01:26:55.574 --> 01:26:59.096]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee, then we'll go to Regina, Dave and others.
[01:26:59.116 --> 01:26:59.737]  Go ahead, John.
[01:27:00.657 --> 01:27:06.760]  I'm a paralegal who might be able to help ranch rescue without violence, but everyone does have the right to self-defend.
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.501]  That's what I said, yes.
[01:27:09.601 --> 01:27:13.102]  He wants me to sit here on the radio and do that, but he won't do it himself.
[01:27:13.582 --> 01:27:18.584]  Well, Casey Nevercott should never plead guilty or he waivers his right to sue for false arrest.
[01:27:18.624 --> 01:27:22.146]  He hasn't, they just keep arresting him and putting him in solitary confinement with no charges.
[01:27:22.791 --> 01:27:32.074]  My sister is a public defender in Tucson, Arizona, but she's never won a case out of thousands of cases, so I don't recommend him relying on a public defender from the government.
[01:27:32.754 --> 01:27:38.316]  And diabetics are in grave danger in jails, where many are killed routinely by denial of medical treatment.
[01:27:38.816 --> 01:27:47.379]  I worked on a $10 million wrongful death civil case of a diabetic in illegal solitary confinement, tortured to death by denial of food, water, and medical care.
[01:27:47.479 --> 01:27:48.500]  Yeah, I know, they do it all the time.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.021]  Am I bad because I'm not calling for armed revolt right now?
[01:27:52.679 --> 01:27:55.341]  Well, you do your part, and other people need to do their part.
[01:27:55.401 --> 01:28:03.325]  Yeah, but I don't think the answer is armed revolt, and I love these people that say, you need to go have an armed revolt, or you're a coward.
[01:28:04.085 --> 01:28:15.452]  Well, there's a place for that, and if Ranch Rescue wants to study the law, and if they see the police breaking the law, they do have the right to self-defense and lawful use of justifiable homicide.
[01:28:16.067 --> 01:28:17.148]  Anybody has that right.
[01:28:17.188 --> 01:28:18.268]  You never wait for that right.
[01:28:18.308 --> 01:28:21.730]  Notice they're not bad if they don't, but I'm bad because I don't.
[01:28:24.192 --> 01:28:24.972]  No comment on that.
[01:28:26.513 --> 01:28:29.555]  The Ranch Rescue people... It's nuts and nobody's going to get that from me.
[01:28:29.775 --> 01:28:32.417]  I'm not going to be some probably feds fool.
[01:28:32.757 --> 01:28:41.262]  I need to study your techniques of using a videotape and an audiotape every time they speak with a cop or a judge or governor.
[01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:47.021]  Anybody they talk to, they need to record that and do transcripts and put them on the web for their own self-defense.
[01:28:47.542 --> 01:28:49.625]  Well, that's what we do and they're scared to death of us.
[01:28:49.646 --> 01:28:54.133]  The good cops love us, the bad ones are scared to death of us and actually run scurrying from me.
[01:28:54.313 --> 01:28:54.874]  And they need to...
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.922]  Casey needs to sue these people immediately for false... Listen, I pulled up the checkpoints.
[01:29:00.082 --> 01:29:03.384]  Hey, hey, I pulled up the checkpoints, John, with 20 cop cars.
[01:29:03.564 --> 01:29:07.486]  I get out now, and they jump in the cars and squeal away.
[01:29:07.786 --> 01:29:10.228]  I mean, tires, tires spinning.
[01:29:10.488 --> 01:29:19.172]  I've done it, and it's scary to do it the first time, but then it starts to be fun because you watch people scurry away and run away when you say, are you confessing to a crime?
[01:29:19.312 --> 01:29:21.153]  Am I getting you to confess to a crime?
[01:29:21.173 --> 01:29:24.135]  And they run away because they don't want to be, uh, citizens arrested.
[01:29:24.733 --> 01:29:27.955]  Well, I just, look, I just expose them and you know what?
[01:29:28.516 --> 01:29:29.396]  It's incredible.
[01:29:30.057 --> 01:29:30.617]  It's incredible.
[01:29:30.737 --> 01:29:32.898]  I know I'm the hardest working person in this movement.
[01:29:33.059 --> 01:29:33.819]  I know it!
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:35.580]  But that's not enough!
[01:29:36.361 --> 01:29:40.123]  That's not enough real men out there!
[01:29:43.485 --> 01:29:44.386]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.866 --> 01:29:46.487]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.388 --> 01:29:50.070]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:53.580]  Gold.
[01:29:53.941 --> 01:29:55.222]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:29:55.482 --> 01:30:01.567]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:30:01.747 --> 01:30:05.570]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:07.832]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:30:07.872 --> 01:30:10.153]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:30:10.314 --> 01:30:17.119]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[01:30:17.159 --> 01:30:17.739]  We're good.
[01:30:35.486 --> 01:30:36.067]  I don't know.
[01:30:52.766 --> 01:30:55.669]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[01:30:55.689 --> 01:30:57.651]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[01:30:57.851 --> 01:31:03.477]  Cheaperhotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCard.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.

[01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:55.942]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[01:31:56.502 --> 01:31:58.143]  Why aren't you using Avocor?

[01:33:00.588 --> 01:33:03.370]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:33:05.591 --> 01:33:06.892]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:07.592 --> 01:33:11.955]  We're now at the halfway point of this Monday Global Transmission.
[01:33:12.015 --> 01:33:13.196]  A ton of news coming up.
[01:33:13.236 --> 01:33:19.300]  We're about to go back to Regina, Dave, Jack, Elizabeth, and others that are patiently holding with our guest Paul Watson.
[01:33:19.821 --> 01:33:26.285]  Hadn't been on the show in three weeks, and I tell you, at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, he's the webmaster for Prison Planet,
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:27.580]  Does a great job.
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:29.741]  My wife's the web manager for Infowars.com.
[01:33:29.761 --> 01:33:31.001]  She does a wonderful job as well.
[01:33:31.341 --> 01:33:33.501]  We've got some major news stories broken.
[01:33:33.841 --> 01:33:38.782]  It looks like they're about to engage in the staged capture of Bin Laden, as we said they would two years ago, as I said they would.
[01:33:39.902 --> 01:33:43.523]  We've got John Kerry with Anton LaVey.
[01:33:43.643 --> 01:33:44.443]  Very revealing.
[01:33:45.263 --> 01:33:50.684]  We've got the NRA engaged in covert gun-grabbing, disarming us as Trojan horse Benedict Arnold.
[01:33:51.764 --> 01:33:54.945]  We've got a lot of important things happening here in the Infowar.
[01:33:55.911 --> 01:33:59.012]  And Paul Watson, good to have you on the show with us, sir.
[01:33:59.512 --> 01:34:00.773]  Great to be back on the air, Alex.
[01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:01.993]  You bet.
[01:34:02.173 --> 01:34:07.275]  You know, I was just thinking, did you hear that guy say, I'm bad because I'm not calling for violence?
[01:34:07.856 --> 01:34:08.636]  Yeah, I heard it.
[01:34:09.516 --> 01:34:14.538]  I get this basically every day, the fact that people say, oh, you're in it to make money.
[01:34:14.558 --> 01:34:20.500]  And if I had a dollar for everybody that said that, then I wouldn't be, I wouldn't need to be in it to make money in the first place.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:24.482]  Because when you look at these people who make these accusations, often you find that
[01:34:25.126 --> 01:34:31.050]  Those people themselves are doing absolutely nothing on their own part, and they're just slinging mud at anyone who is interested.
[01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:34.392]  Well, it's like somebody called last week and was mad that Mel Gibson's movie was doing well.
[01:34:34.432 --> 01:34:37.955]  It was on Thursday, and good, he makes good films.
[01:34:38.275 --> 01:34:39.496]  Now he can make more.
[01:34:40.516 --> 01:34:43.338]  But my point is, I say make copies of my videos.
[01:34:43.658 --> 01:34:44.839]  Oh, that's not good enough.
[01:34:44.859 --> 01:34:49.742]  You're supposed to have a cardboard box you live in, and you stand there on the street corner, and you don't...
[01:34:50.823 --> 01:34:53.046]  By the way, the government takes your money by force!
[01:34:53.206 --> 01:34:53.927]  We're bad!
[01:34:54.247 --> 01:34:58.251]  Because we say, here we have a book, or we have a video, you can make copies of it too.
[01:34:58.551 --> 01:35:01.154]  We're suddenly bad, but forget that argument.
[01:35:01.174 --> 01:35:05.319]  The other argument was, you know, you're no leader, you need to call for violence.
[01:35:05.379 --> 01:35:07.361]  Well, notice the people always doing that.
[01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:10.484]  I remember people would tell militia leaders to do that.
[01:35:10.564 --> 01:35:12.206]  They'd sit there in the shadows and do it.
[01:35:13.266 --> 01:35:19.848]  The militia leader would shoot their mouth off, the feds would grab them, and then suddenly the person who told them to do it would jump up and be in the article.
[01:35:20.108 --> 01:35:23.049]  Long-time informant said that he recorded the violent statements.
[01:35:23.309 --> 01:35:25.190]  It's always the long-time informant.
[01:35:25.530 --> 01:35:27.630]  So, they know we're winning peaceably.
[01:35:27.891 --> 01:35:33.812]  They know we're hurting them and exposing their crimes, so they want to get us to prematurely move with violence.
[01:35:34.012 --> 01:35:36.033]  I'm praying we can avert violence.
[01:35:36.093 --> 01:35:42.235]  If it goes to martial law, and believe me, you'll know when you're in total martial law, then we have no choice, Paul.
[01:35:43.012 --> 01:35:44.393]  Well, yeah, I mean, H.G.
[01:35:44.433 --> 01:35:49.877]  Wells said that the 21st century was the battle for the mind, and that's what we've got.
[01:35:50.177 --> 01:35:54.880]  Only desperate people turn to violence, which is why the government themselves have turned to violence.
[01:35:55.581 --> 01:36:04.423]  And, um, throughout history we've seen that small groups of informed and committed individuals are the only groups that can ever affect any kind of positive change.
[01:36:04.483 --> 01:36:17.586]  And to say that you're not out there in the field actually doing something, well, anyone can watch Matrix of Evil, for example, where you're out on the road each time giving these speeches, throwing out the Patriot Act, etc.
[01:36:17.967 --> 01:36:18.807]  That is in the battle.
[01:36:18.827 --> 01:36:22.288]  Yeah, traveling to Texas towns, throwing out the Patriot Act.
[01:36:22.748 --> 01:36:23.448]  I've done nothing.
[01:36:23.508 --> 01:36:23.828]  I love it.
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:29.404]  That's the ultimate proactive video, Matrix of Evil, where people can see the fruits of your labor.
[01:36:29.825 --> 01:36:37.091]  So to accuse you of just sitting behind a radio studio or sitting behind a computer is completely debunked by that very video.
[01:36:37.151 --> 01:36:42.376]  Well, Paul, I've called you at ten o'clock at night and you're still up working.
[01:36:43.537 --> 01:36:44.378]  I'm up working.
[01:36:44.738 --> 01:36:48.782]  I mean, I burn with a desire to expose these bastards.
[01:36:49.634 --> 01:36:57.456]  I mean, it's incredible, and it just shocks me the excuses people go to, the lengths they go to, not to take action themselves.
[01:36:57.596 --> 01:36:59.256]  Oh, it's this other person.
[01:36:59.516 --> 01:37:04.337]  You know, I hope people will buy your book, Paul, so you can occasionally eat more than beans and bread.
[01:37:04.357 --> 01:37:07.658]  I know you live in a pretty bad part of town and don't make a lot of money.
[01:37:07.678 --> 01:37:09.718]  I know that's one of your sole sources of income.
[01:37:09.758 --> 01:37:14.299]  I hope they'll buy Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Care, and the New World Order.
[01:37:15.139 --> 01:37:21.221]  I mean, I sure hope they do that, because you've had to restrict what's on your own website because of the cost of bandwidth.
[01:37:22.221 --> 01:37:27.382]  So, you know, I sure hope, I mean, folks make it what they want, you know, we're not going to be on shortwave next hour.
[01:37:27.662 --> 01:37:34.064]  We won't be on shortwave first hour tonight, so yes, don't worry, we won't ask for money, we just won't be on the air.
[01:37:34.304 --> 01:37:34.944]  How's that sound?
[01:37:35.664 --> 01:37:40.785]  Now, Paul, going back into the news, where would you like to start?
[01:37:40.825 --> 01:37:42.546]  How about the NRA and gun control?
[01:37:43.186 --> 01:37:44.146]  Yeah, we can start with that.
[01:37:44.679 --> 01:37:56.728]  We posted the article yesterday, it's in the February 29th archive now, which is the Senate Amendment 2625, which will basically be a ban of all armor-piercing ammunition.
[01:37:57.409 --> 01:38:07.036]  And the rhetoric coming from the NRA director craves that the ban will preclude armor relating to hunting and sporting ammunition.
[01:38:07.076 --> 01:38:10.639]  Now understand, a full metal jacket of any type is considered armor-piercing.
[01:38:11.252 --> 01:38:20.378]  Yeah, they're using the same justification that the Nazis used in the 38 gun control law, which of course is a mirror image of the US gun control Act.
[01:38:20.518 --> 01:38:25.140]  Actual translation by the late Senator Dodd, not the current Bilderberg group member Dodd.
[01:38:25.561 --> 01:38:32.385]  Also, the NRA in North Dakota got caught blocking a bill that would have had Vermont-style concealed carry.
[01:38:32.425 --> 01:38:35.707]  They said, we are for not carrying guns without permits.
[01:38:36.488 --> 01:38:48.019]  Yeah, the NRA Conservatives are actually worse than the Liberals because this new bill actually dwarfs that of Senator Kennedy's previous amendment relating to armour-piercing ammunition.
[01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:51.563]  So the justification that they're using is to
[01:38:52.243 --> 01:38:54.944]  Protect law enforcement personnel.
[01:38:55.184 --> 01:39:01.867]  So this, of course, means that when the nice man in the black ski mask comes knocking on your door, they will be armed and you won't.
[01:39:01.907 --> 01:39:12.450]  So it's just a continuation of the NRA sellout and the fact that... And then we better go ahead and arrest you because this full metal jacket is really banned now and then the jury won't know the difference and will convict you.
[01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:14.211]  I mean, it's a great new system!
[01:39:15.151 --> 01:39:18.172]  There's also the gun show loophole bill to shut down the gun shows.
[01:39:18.753 --> 01:39:19.433]  But here's the deal.
[01:39:20.157 --> 01:39:20.717]  Here's the deal.
[01:39:20.777 --> 01:39:23.378]  This new bill is being supported by the NRA.
[01:39:23.678 --> 01:39:25.759]  Do you understand?
[01:39:25.899 --> 01:39:33.622]  And in the federal case a few months ago, which of course the NRA lost on purpose, they argued that we are for registering guns and not leaving your house with firearms.
[01:39:33.702 --> 01:39:34.662]  Now that's a quote.
[01:39:36.022 --> 01:39:43.185]  And if anyone doesn't know the ramifications of this, then try living in England when we've got quadruple the crime rate.
[01:39:43.737 --> 01:39:56.146]  We've got the government saying that you can't defend your own house from intruders, that burglars now have rights when they enter your house, and you can't even use a baseball bat to defend yourself, so that's the way that this is heading.
[01:39:57.947 --> 01:40:01.090]  I know, it's just uh... it's insane, and uh...
[01:40:02.526 --> 01:40:04.489]  Okay, so there you have it.
[01:40:04.529 --> 01:40:05.390]  More conservatism.
[01:40:05.410 --> 01:40:06.371]  They're going to get your guns.
[01:40:06.451 --> 01:40:07.733]  I'm liberal because I'm against it.
[01:40:08.073 --> 01:40:08.854]  I'm not doing enough.
[01:40:08.914 --> 01:40:09.595]  I understand that.
[01:40:10.937 --> 01:40:12.559]  Don't worry, I'll probably be in a FEMA camp soon.
[01:40:12.579 --> 01:40:13.741]  It'll all be my fault, I'm sure.
[01:40:16.292 --> 01:40:20.035]  Sitting here looking at the Bible, they're passing martial law legislation right now in your country.
[01:40:20.055 --> 01:40:21.457]  It's happening here.
[01:40:22.478 --> 01:40:24.820]  We did help defeat it up in Rhode Island.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.501]  They had to withdraw it for now.
[01:40:27.162 --> 01:40:28.623]  But let's get into Satanism.
[01:40:28.683 --> 01:40:35.549]  Skull and Bones, this new article going back to 1982 with John Forbes Carey and his master, Anton LaVey.
[01:40:37.251 --> 01:40:38.572]  Well, a word of caution on that.
[01:40:39.152 --> 01:40:42.175]  Still investigating it, but I've had a few emails which say that
[01:40:42.856 --> 01:40:45.778]  This photo is actually staged.
[01:40:46.839 --> 01:40:48.500]  Obviously we're not going to lie to people.
[01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:53.423]  We have the photo of Kerry in the anti-war rally with Jane Fonda, which later came out on stage.
[01:40:54.203 --> 01:40:57.766]  And the article, which is from the San Francisco Chronicle,
[01:40:58.468 --> 01:41:24.183]  is dated Sunday July 17 1982 now a lot of people have said that there was no Sunday July 17 1982 it was in fact a Saturday so it seems at the moment and we haven't confirmed this obviously we'll keep people updated that this may be another example of how they try to muddy the waters on the fact that people are pointing out Kerry's involvement in Skull and Bones along with his
[01:41:25.096 --> 01:41:27.277]  Cousin George Bush, so... I don't know.
[01:41:27.397 --> 01:41:31.458]  I went and saw some articles that have now been written about it, and I looked at that photo.
[01:41:31.478 --> 01:41:33.518]  I mean, it looks real to me.
[01:41:34.958 --> 01:41:38.319]  As soon as we get any kind of confirmation, obviously, we'll let people know.
[01:41:39.219 --> 01:41:52.243]  But the fact is that there is no Sunday, July 17th, 1982, although the date, the actual year, is obscured by the corner of the newspaper, so we're yet to have any clarification on that.
[01:41:52.583 --> 01:41:54.203]  But we will do so as soon as possible.
[01:41:55.023 --> 01:42:01.047]  Well, we know that out in San Francisco, a lot of the Hollywood, a lot of the politicians liked Anton LaVey.
[01:42:01.367 --> 01:42:02.548]  He's dead now, of course.
[01:42:02.588 --> 01:42:07.511]  And we know that going to Skull and Bones, that that is an admitted satanic organization.
[01:42:08.192 --> 01:42:11.054]  And we know Bush basically worshipped Ozzie.
[01:42:11.374 --> 01:42:14.516]  You know how great he is, hell and death, you know, Sabbath, bloody Sabbath.
[01:42:14.836 --> 01:42:15.797]  Bush starts laughing.
[01:42:15.817 --> 01:42:16.637]  I mean, we know that.
[01:42:16.898 --> 01:42:18.159]  It's hard to believe this stuff.
[01:42:19.372 --> 01:42:20.273]  I mean, there it is.
[01:42:20.873 --> 01:42:31.161]  One article I said last week, I don't know if it's real, was that Capital Press article about Jewish group wants to, you know, have Mel Gibson arrested and the film banned.
[01:42:31.541 --> 01:42:35.804]  Then I see a mainstream AFP article where they are banning it in France!
[01:42:35.984 --> 01:42:38.767]  So, that is confirmed.
[01:42:39.567 --> 01:42:42.609]  Any word on that other article about Jewish group in the U.S.
[01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:43.350]  wanting it to be banned?
[01:42:44.091 --> 01:42:59.216]  I didn't see that article, but it goes along the same track as if you fight the Nazis, then you're for the Nazis, according to these big establishment Jewish groups, which don't represent Jewish people, they represent the attempt to defame people that are fighting against tyranny.
[01:42:59.896 --> 01:43:11.861]  And so, yeah, basically we'll be tracking that, but the fact that the ADL endorsed Arnold Schwarzenegger and, you know, the Simon Wiesenthal Center again attests to that fact that anyone who publicly supports
[01:43:13.672 --> 01:43:32.744]  They weren't publicly supporting the Nazis, basically Schwarzenegger did is then endorsed by these Jewish groups and I'll be posting a kind of video compendium later on today about how Schwarzenegger came out publicly in support of the Nazis and then was then supported by the Jewish group so watch out for that on the website.
[01:43:33.405 --> 01:43:34.826]  Alright, I can't wait to see it.
[01:43:35.626 --> 01:43:38.348]  Got a bunch of calls here but there's a lot of other news items I want to cover.
[01:43:39.309 --> 01:43:39.609]  Paul,
[01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:44.413]  The stage capture of Bin Laden coming up.
[01:43:44.473 --> 01:44:02.608]  Now, just to recap that for folks, now they're saying that they're hot on his trail in Pakistan, but we have the information that he's been dead for two years on ice from kidney failure, and now that's really being borne out as they hype up the impending stage capture.
[01:44:02.949 --> 01:44:05.671]  Headline, US, Pakistan and I, Bin Laden was captured.
[01:44:06.704 --> 01:44:10.267]  Official Iranian news over the weekend said he had been captured.
[01:44:10.287 --> 01:44:11.108]  What do you have on this?
[01:44:12.269 --> 01:44:22.997]  Well, as I've said before, I basically have the information that Bin Laden has been stationed in Pakistan, in that region that they're talking about, since at least 1998, protected by elite U.S.
[01:44:23.077 --> 01:44:27.200]  commandos and being visited by British and American ambassadors.
[01:44:27.381 --> 01:44:29.302]  Now, by the way, that was a major British paper.
[01:44:29.322 --> 01:44:30.303]  Tell them about that.
[01:44:31.334 --> 01:44:53.507]  Well, yeah, it came out in Sunday Times, which picked up a Dawn article, which is the biggest paper in Pakistan, where a couple who were holidaying in Pakistan got lost and basically they were detained at a checkpoint because they mistakenly stumbled upon what the people at the checkpoint called the secret lair of Osama bin Laden.
[01:44:53.948 --> 01:44:59.451]  And then this same couple were later visited by US and British ambassadors.
[01:45:00.089 --> 01:45:07.033]  Who bragged that they had visited Bin Laden, and who were working around the region that Bin Laden was situated in.
[01:45:07.073 --> 01:45:15.038]  And of course, at the very same time, Bin Laden was flying to Albania to help launch the attacks on the Serbs, given tens of millions of dollars of weapons.
[01:45:15.058 --> 01:45:16.138]  I mean, it's the same story.
[01:45:16.719 --> 01:45:18.880]  Clinton refused to have him arrested, Bush did.
[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:22.202]  The same deal over and over again.
[01:45:22.262 --> 01:45:26.544]  Now they're saying they're hot on his trail, Paul, about to capture him any day now.
[01:45:27.425 --> 01:45:28.906]  Yeah, we've actually got the story
[01:45:29.474 --> 01:45:49.588]  Today, which talks about the fact that the US government are willing to pardon Musharraf and Pakistan for supporting Abdul Khan, who, as you've covered on your show, was the guy who armed one of the people who armed North Korea, Libya, Iran with nuclear weapons.
[01:45:49.628 --> 01:45:55.492]  But then, of course, he was bankrolled by the Bush administration, so now they're using this bullying stick
[01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:58.610]  To tempt Pakistan to allow U.S.
[01:45:58.650 --> 01:45:59.971]  forces into that area.
[01:46:00.351 --> 01:46:09.412]  Now understand, Bush signed W1999 not just to pull FBI off Al Qaeda, but to block this investigation in early 2001.
[01:46:09.892 --> 01:46:13.853]  And this was in the BBC two and a half years ago.
[01:46:14.793 --> 01:46:18.174]  Yeah, so now we're getting set for these U.S.
[01:46:18.214 --> 01:46:22.435]  forces to go into Pakistan, and by no means is it a search for Bin Laden.
[01:46:22.475 --> 01:46:23.915]  They know exactly where he is.
[01:46:24.557 --> 01:46:29.819]  Probably have done for at least six years, and so Pakistan will probably accept that offer.
[01:46:29.939 --> 01:46:39.723]  They'll go in, they'll pick him up out of some kind of hole, just like Saddam Hussein was kept in for many months, as is now proven, because the Kurdish militia were guarding him.
[01:46:40.123 --> 01:46:41.264]  And we're not the only ones saying this.
[01:46:41.304 --> 01:46:49.547]  We've got members of Congress, Madeleine Albright, former Secretary of State, and two years ago, over two years ago, right after 9-11, I was told by someone in the White House
[01:46:50.896 --> 01:46:52.037]  That's all I can say.
[01:46:52.177 --> 01:46:57.301]  That, oh, he's dead of kidney failure, he works for us, we're going to stage his release right before the election.
[01:46:57.961 --> 01:47:12.691]  Yeah, also, Senator Grassley said the same thing, and that's the important thing to know, that these people are so hopped up on power, ego-driven, that they will from time to time brag of the script that's about to unfold.
[01:47:12.731 --> 01:47:17.775]  Just like the other senator, or the other LaHood, saying, oh yeah, we already got Saddam,
[01:47:19.477 --> 01:47:24.341]  And then you've got Tommy Franks two weeks before they capture him going, oh don't worry, we're about to bring him out.
[01:47:25.462 --> 01:47:47.201]  Yeah, so in every instance of this we have people bragging before the event itself which is why we're able to pre-empt the news and in the last three weeks we've seen this Osama about to be captured story hyped in the media right after we basically picked up on it on this show and so again we've pre-empted the news, we do it time and again.
[01:47:48.297 --> 01:47:50.919]  Over and over again, just incredible.
[01:47:51.519 --> 01:48:01.447]  President's radio address, and it's already started even before he announced it, everywhere they're announcing all children will be drug tested, blood, urine, you name it, you're all prisoners basically.
[01:48:01.707 --> 01:48:05.069]  And now Bush says federal drug testing for everyone will start.
[01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.970]  Ha ha!
[01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:08.592]  I mean, is this not maximum Orwellville?
[01:48:09.813 --> 01:48:11.094]  Well, it's surpassed Orwell.
[01:48:11.821 --> 01:48:18.316]  I mean even Washington Times a few months ago admitted that today's society is more surveilled than anything that Orwell predicted.
[01:48:18.677 --> 01:48:20.561]  And with the drug tests in the schools we had.
[01:48:21.252 --> 01:48:29.737]  Three, four weeks ago, Tony Blair announcing the exact same thing, that drug tests will be mandated for every student, even in, you know, primary schools.
[01:48:29.777 --> 01:48:48.448]  And notice, simultaneously, from Australia to New Zealand to Canada to the US to England, what I call the Echelon Group, because they all implement things at the same time, sort of with Echelon, I mean, it's the same... Now, I've seen some articles, but do they let the government grab people's children and kill them with drug tests, like they do the toddlers here in the US?
[01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:51.652]  Yeah.
[01:48:51.692 --> 01:48:55.538]  That's in the New York Post today, by the way.
[01:48:55.638 --> 01:49:00.466]  Yeah, and even with the welfare system in America and in Britain that I've seen,
[01:49:01.816 --> 01:49:11.564]  They will withdraw welfare from any parent which refuses to give their baby, even going down as a one-year-old baby, twenty or more vaccinations.
[01:49:11.965 --> 01:49:22.814]  But his newborn babies, who don't even have AIDS in many cases, with drugs tested on them, and new vaccines just tested on babies, and it says in the article they're killing them.
[01:49:23.034 --> 01:49:24.035]  And they go, what's the big deal?
[01:49:24.075 --> 01:49:25.036]  We're just testing on them.
[01:49:26.016 --> 01:49:27.778]  I mean, this is so nuts, Paul.
[01:49:28.775 --> 01:49:42.164]  Well, of course, we've also got a story out today which is the anthrax jabs that are being given to the soldiers in Iraq now causing infanticide, baby death, babies with missing limbs.
[01:49:58.695 --> 01:49:59.836]  Paul, boy, I tell ya...
[01:50:19.932 --> 01:50:23.273]  Well, you know, Press International did a massive investigation on this.
[01:50:23.773 --> 01:50:32.476]  They've got their own special section on their website, which is, you know, the tens of cases where this has happened, and also the media trying to cover it up.
[01:50:32.516 --> 01:50:36.838]  But now they've publicly grabbed your kid and admittedly go test on it and kill it as a newborn.
[01:50:37.498 --> 01:50:40.099]  Yeah, so they've just conditioned people and now they're admitting it.
[01:50:40.199 --> 01:50:42.039]  Now they're just openly, we're coming to kill your children!
[01:50:42.099 --> 01:50:43.420]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:46.541]  Ha ha, we're gonna wait until we get your guns, we're gonna take real good care of you.
[01:50:47.156 --> 01:50:47.696]  Stay there, Paul.
[01:50:47.716 --> 01:50:48.716]  We'll keep you up to the next hour.
[01:50:48.736 --> 01:50:49.577]  We've got a bunch of news.
[01:50:49.597 --> 01:50:50.897]  We'll come back and go to the calls.
[01:50:51.277 --> 01:50:51.837]  Just stay with us.
[01:50:53.737 --> 01:50:56.098]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:50:56.338 --> 01:51:00.179]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:51:00.499 --> 01:51:01.319]  Read the labels.
[01:51:01.739 --> 01:51:05.880]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:10.281]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:51:10.661 --> 01:51:15.522]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:51:15.922 --> 01:51:19.465]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[01:56:25.573 --> 01:56:29.696]  First of all, I want to thank you, too, for all your good work of exposing all this to us.
[01:56:29.796 --> 01:56:33.579]  It's painful as it becomes sometimes, but I wanted to mention that
[01:56:34.788 --> 01:56:44.490]  I had just gotten a letter from the Civil Homeland Defense, Chris Simcox, Alex, and he indicated, remember about a year ago, or I don't know how long ago it was?
[01:56:44.590 --> 01:56:47.891]  Yeah, this was out in Arizona, people tracking the illegal invasion, yeah.
[01:56:48.391 --> 01:57:01.154]  Right, and remember when either you or maybe both you and Stat Miller had him on, he was under attack as far as some activity, walking through with... Yeah, they were claiming they were terrorists, and yeah.
[01:57:02.483 --> 01:57:10.985]  And this letter indicates that he's continuing to stand strong and assist the Border Patrol, filling the gaps and protecting the families.
[01:57:11.025 --> 01:57:17.847]  I just wonder, maybe this Nethercutt doesn't have a good attorney, and maybe he needs some good contacts.
[01:57:17.907 --> 01:57:21.788]  Well, yeah, I'm not sure about that, but by the way,
[01:57:24.582 --> 01:57:33.448]  We have, you know, had all these different organizations and groups on the show, and, you know, it does seem to be, you know, depending on what group you're running with, what happens.
[01:57:33.488 --> 01:57:43.195]  And the Border Patrol appreciates these groups, because the Border Patrol's getting killed and shot by Mexican troops, and federal agents, FBI's being killed, Forestry Service is being killed.
[01:57:43.555 --> 01:57:44.395]  They appreciate it.
[01:57:44.435 --> 01:57:49.459]  It's the feds that come into town and harass and arrest and beat up patriots.
[01:57:49.619 --> 01:57:51.000]  Paul Watson comments to this?
[01:57:52.625 --> 01:57:59.227]  Well, how would any of the listeners feel if you woke up one morning to find a bunch of Mexicans outside your window?
[01:57:59.267 --> 01:58:06.148]  And we've had the stories where they break in, destroy your property, steal your possessions, rape women.
[01:58:06.188 --> 01:58:14.630]  We had a story a few weeks ago, a group of nine Mexicans across the border raped one woman in a gang-rape situation.
[01:58:14.710 --> 01:58:20.631]  And it's the same thing in England, where if you stab someone in your house raping your wife, you get life in prison, don't you, Paul?
[01:58:21.241 --> 01:58:21.461]  Yeah.
[01:58:21.841 --> 01:58:22.762]  So it's the same thing.
[01:58:22.822 --> 01:58:23.803]  They're letting us know.
[01:58:24.103 --> 01:58:25.463]  You're not going to defend yourself.
[01:58:25.544 --> 01:58:26.004]  You got it?
[01:58:26.404 --> 01:58:28.485]  Feds are going to let these foreign troops kill you.
[01:58:28.685 --> 01:58:30.686]  And you're going to arrest the people that try to protect you.
[01:58:31.587 --> 01:58:32.648]  Does that make you mad, Paul?
[01:58:32.688 --> 01:58:33.548]  Make you mad, Regina?
[01:58:34.609 --> 01:58:35.569]  Sure makes me mad.
[01:58:36.009 --> 01:58:37.050]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:37.090 --> 01:58:37.690]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.711 --> 01:58:39.712]  A lot more coming up.
[01:58:39.732 --> 01:58:40.992]  It's going to be totally jam-packed.
[01:58:41.012 --> 01:58:41.833]  More calls, more news.
[01:58:43.579 --> 01:58:46.840]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:51.081]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:58:51.342 --> 01:58:54.122]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:58:54.323 --> 01:58:56.723]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:58:56.903 --> 01:59:05.546]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:59:05.746 --> 01:59:07.087]  The Brooklyn Light is different.
[01:59:07.287 --> 01:59:11.408]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:59:11.408 --> 01:59:12.209]  We're good to go!
[01:59:30.742 --> 01:59:31.182]  Big Brother.
[01:59:31.202 --> 01:59:32.443]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:32.643 --> 01:59:33.684]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:33.724 --> 01:59:34.284]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.329 --> 01:59:57.210]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.230 --> 02:00:01.494]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.074 --> 02:00:06.198]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.979 --> 02:00:08.700]  Alright, folks.
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:09.861]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.941 --> 02:00:16.567]  We're now into the third hour of global transmission against tyranny on this Monday edition.
[02:00:17.628 --> 02:00:22.152]  About to go back to Jack and Elizabeth and Michelle and Steve and others.
[02:00:23.237 --> 02:00:33.906]  I got articles about biometrics going in all the schools, more cameras in the school bathrooms, drug testing all students, everyone guilty until proven innocent, no exceptions, federally controlled.
[02:00:34.446 --> 02:00:37.508]  And then one of the folks at Genesis just walked in and said, have you seen World Net Daily?
[02:00:37.528 --> 02:00:38.389]  And obviously I missed it.
[02:00:38.409 --> 02:00:40.731]  Maybe Paul saw it and will post it.
[02:00:41.351 --> 02:00:43.393]  Virginia schools, $2 million system.
[02:00:43.413 --> 02:00:44.354]  He was just reading it to me.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:51.142]  Two million dollar system to thumb scan every student when they get on the bus to make sure it's the right student on the right bus.
[02:00:51.162 --> 02:00:53.824]  See, biometrically getting them into the system.
[02:00:54.224 --> 02:00:58.665]  Already most school districts making them thumb scan to buy and sell, no cash allowed.
[02:00:59.486 --> 02:01:01.667]  This is the total control, is it not Paul?
[02:01:02.667 --> 02:01:04.848]  Yeah, I mean... Did you see that article?
[02:01:05.633 --> 02:01:08.394]  It must have been posted just a couple of hours ago, but I didn't see it.
[02:01:08.414 --> 02:01:09.534]  Yeah, we'll post it.
[02:01:09.634 --> 02:01:32.501]  The fact is that Total Information Awareness with this Big Brother system was supposed to be federal, but then we had Matrix, which was state-based, and now right at the top of PrisonPlanet.com, I've got the Washington Times article out today, where the Electronic Privacy Information Center intercepted an internal email from the Total Information Awareness office run by John Poindexter.
[02:01:33.334 --> 02:01:43.526]  And it stated that, quote, ultimately the US may need huge databases of commercial transactions that cover the world or certain areas outside the US.
[02:01:43.587 --> 02:01:50.195]  This information provides economic utility and thus provides two reasons why foreign countries would be interested.
[02:01:50.635 --> 02:01:53.296]  Yeah, now, I mean, all over they're putting the same system in.
[02:01:53.356 --> 02:01:56.876]  Matrix is the local suction port for the feds.
[02:01:56.936 --> 02:01:58.357]  By the way, they admit it's still there.
[02:01:58.697 --> 02:02:00.397]  All 50 states are really involved.
[02:02:00.697 --> 02:02:02.397]  Tim's program was never gotten rid of.
[02:02:02.417 --> 02:02:05.738]  Your cable guy, your phone man, spying on you for all crimes.
[02:02:06.238 --> 02:02:09.499]  And then, oh, we've got to put thumb scanners in the school buses now.
[02:02:10.719 --> 02:02:11.879]  We'll get that posted.
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:13.780]  They were just reading it to me during the break.
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:14.640]  It's there right now.
[02:02:15.420 --> 02:02:18.901]  I mean, just, Paul, it's every angle we're getting hit by this.
[02:02:19.631 --> 02:02:33.122]  Yeah, and we've had several articles recently which talked about the fact that although Total Information Awareness was defeated, they then rolled out 13 sub-programs which were even worse than... Yeah, all they do is change the name each time.
[02:02:33.202 --> 02:02:34.903]  It's called the NSA Control Grid.
[02:02:35.501 --> 02:02:43.763]  Yeah, now in this Washington Times article they're talking about foregoing any kind of state or federal database and just rolling it into a world database.
[02:02:43.843 --> 02:02:55.847]  Which three years ago the UN called for a world ID card system and lo and behold we have the international standardization of passports and driver's licenses and lo and behold it's been going in to a Brussels Belgium computer since 1985!
[02:02:58.001 --> 02:03:05.030]  Well, tied in with this, we've got the RFID tracking chips, which, to mention a story we posted on Prison Planet.
[02:03:05.050 --> 02:03:07.613]  The Pentagon's behind it, yeah.
[02:03:07.673 --> 02:03:13.701]  We had a couple who had money in their wallets, which mostly consisted of the new coloured money $20 bills.
[02:03:15.246 --> 02:03:20.388]  And they were about to leave a truck stop when the electronic theft detectors went berserk.
[02:03:20.988 --> 02:03:26.510]  So when they bought some aluminium foil and wrapped the notes in the detectors, they stopped going off.
[02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:28.050]  By the way, we've done that test.
[02:03:28.110 --> 02:03:28.831]  It's an accurate one.
[02:03:28.871 --> 02:03:29.651]  Macau's got the story.
[02:03:29.691 --> 02:03:30.131]  We've got it.
[02:03:30.451 --> 02:03:32.752]  And then they put them in the microwave and tell them what happened.
[02:03:33.402 --> 02:03:48.285]  Yeah, they went home and put the notes in the microwave and lo and behold the notes started exploding one by one at the exact point of Andrew Jackson's eye on the right eye on the $20 bill and we've got photos on the website attesting to that.
[02:03:48.425 --> 02:03:53.646]  By the way, I've been pulling RFIDs out of money for years and people still don't know there's RFIDs in them.
[02:03:53.826 --> 02:03:59.627]  When they've got new, even more advanced ones in there that scan everything, well, they can tell how much money you've got everything.
[02:04:00.222 --> 02:04:16.397]  Yeah, so, I mean, this story not only proves that, as is the case with the Euronotes, which was publicly admitted to contain RFID tags, the new coloured money has these RFID tags already embedded, but it also confirms pre-planning on the part of the government.
[02:04:16.417 --> 02:04:24.405]  They knew that people would try to destroy these chips by microwaving the money, so by whatever method, they'd bypass that possibility.
[02:04:25.077 --> 02:04:29.561]  That's right, the old microwavable ones, the old chips didn't explode, and I've seen it.
[02:04:30.282 --> 02:04:33.685]  In fact, I'm going to videotape this demonstration and put it online in the next few days, Paul.
[02:04:34.386 --> 02:04:37.229]  We're going to put a bunch of 20s in the microwave and show people that as well.
[02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:39.371]  This is the new America, folks.
[02:04:39.411 --> 02:04:39.911]  You like it?
[02:04:40.052 --> 02:04:41.133]  It's worse than 1984.
[02:04:41.893 --> 02:04:42.914]  We'll be back with your calls.
[02:04:42.934 --> 02:04:43.335]  Stay with us.
[02:04:45.518 --> 02:04:48.979]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:04:49.259 --> 02:04:52.761]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:04:52.861 --> 02:04:56.802]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:04:57.022 --> 02:05:03.184]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:05:03.584 --> 02:05:11.487]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:05:11.907 --> 02:05:17.271]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:05:17.411 --> 02:05:21.193]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:05:21.554 --> 02:05:23.395]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[02:05:23.475 --> 02:05:25.636]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:05:25.876 --> 02:05:31.140]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:36.404]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:07:40.153 --> 02:07:40.394]  P.O.
[02:07:40.434 --> 02:07:42.675]  Box 1227 Jacksonville, Oregon 97530.
[02:07:45.256 --> 02:07:50.298]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:50.658 --> 02:07:52.940]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:57.553 --> 02:08:09.381]  Paul, here in a few minutes, we're going to have Stephanie, our Norwegian board operator, who does a great job, on the show with us, to read this World Net Daily article.
[02:08:09.522 --> 02:08:14.405]  And the guy that was telling me about it during the break, it's not Virginia, though I have seen it in Virginia, with similar systems.
[02:08:15.125 --> 02:08:23.693]  $2 million system in one Florida district to thumb scan the kids to get on and off the bus and to make sure that wrong kids aren't riding the bus.
[02:08:23.733 --> 02:08:24.774]  It's for everyone's safety.
[02:08:24.834 --> 02:08:27.636]  And all over the country they're putting fences up around the schools.
[02:08:27.976 --> 02:08:29.417]  Can't come in to get your own children.
[02:08:29.457 --> 02:08:30.598]  Of course it's for their safety.
[02:08:31.539 --> 02:08:38.725]  Paul Watson, we're about to go to Dave in California and Jack and then Elizabeth, Michelle, Steve and others.
[02:08:39.526 --> 02:08:41.728]  But there's a lot of other news here.
[02:08:42.701 --> 02:08:46.663]  That's very, very important that we need to go over.
[02:08:47.383 --> 02:08:49.324]  What are some of the top stories?
[02:08:49.384 --> 02:08:58.909]  I know we've got the Colonel Don DeGrand Prix article, thanks to a listener transcribed, and the audio of that up on the site, and it's sending shockwaves across the internet.
[02:08:58.929 --> 02:09:01.570]  Why do you think folks are so interested in this article?
[02:09:02.251 --> 02:09:08.173]  Well, yeah, we've also got the Michael Shrimpton audio and transcript, but with the Colonel Don DeGrand Prix.
[02:09:09.858 --> 02:09:19.362]  If you listen to that audio, which I did last night, you will hear many new caveats to the 9-11 story, which completely contradict the official version of events.
[02:09:19.422 --> 02:09:36.450]  For example, the fact that the Colonel himself knows personally the man who shot down Flight 93, when we've got the official version of events, which told us that the brave passengers took down that plane with the whole, you know, let's roll version of events and so,
[02:09:37.745 --> 02:09:48.151]  The Colonel says that basically the planes used on 9-11 sitting at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, the actual planes that you saw crash were mock-ups basically.
[02:09:48.691 --> 02:09:53.213]  He goes through the whole story, analyzes it, how it was carried out.
[02:09:53.294 --> 02:09:55.975]  And he gets this all from his high-level sources in the Pentagon.
[02:09:56.918 --> 02:10:06.063]  On top of it, we now have the big, highly respected Spanish newspaper looking at the Bellican bomb on the bottom of one of those planes.
[02:10:06.383 --> 02:10:09.965]  Pilots have looked at it and they say, yeah, no plane has that configuration.
[02:10:10.005 --> 02:10:10.805]  This has been altered.
[02:10:11.525 --> 02:10:18.229]  Yeah, I think it's called the Vanguardia newspaper in Spain, which is one of the most highly respected newspapers there.
[02:10:18.249 --> 02:10:19.970]  It's been around over a hundred years.
[02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:22.411]  Did a detailed analysis of flight.
[02:10:23.115 --> 02:10:25.597]  It's amazing some folks can get that transcript.
[02:10:25.618 --> 02:10:26.939]  Also the Shrimpton interview.
[02:10:26.959 --> 02:10:29.921]  The Shrimpton interview, of course, why is that important?
[02:10:46.576 --> 02:10:50.057]  Well, it proves we had stories before.
[02:10:50.077 --> 02:11:00.300]  I had a story from a big British journalist who talked to an MI6 agent who said directly that Dr David Kelly was killed, he didn't commit suicide.
[02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:09.302]  Now we've got Shrimpton himself coming out and saying that according to his sources within MI5, MI6, that they hired out
[02:11:10.071 --> 02:11:11.972]  We have that transcript available on the site as well.
[02:11:11.992 --> 02:11:13.553]  Thanks for your great work.
[02:11:13.573 --> 02:11:17.915]  We're about to go to some calls in a few minutes.
[02:11:17.935 --> 02:11:19.335]  But Stephanie, are you there with us?
[02:11:40.487 --> 02:11:41.507]  Are you on the air now with us?
[02:11:41.627 --> 02:11:42.528]  Yes, I'm on the air.
[02:11:43.088 --> 02:11:44.168]  Awesome, good.
[02:11:44.829 --> 02:11:50.311]  Stephanie, because I don't allow myself to have a computer in the studio because it distracts me, you do have the World Net Daily article.
[02:11:50.331 --> 02:11:51.551]  We'll get this posted on the sites.
[02:11:52.051 --> 02:12:00.355]  Thumb scanners now to be in the school buses, conditioning our children for the cashless society, national sales tax, control grid, worldwide control grid.
[02:12:00.795 --> 02:12:02.095]  This is the global beast system.
[02:12:02.936 --> 02:12:03.716]  Tell us all about it.
[02:12:03.896 --> 02:12:04.996]  Please read that article for us.
[02:12:05.096 --> 02:12:06.517]  Okay, this was printed in the St.
[02:12:06.557 --> 02:12:09.038]  Petersburg Times in Tampa Bay, Florida.
[02:12:09.622 --> 02:12:16.847]  It says, the Pinellas School System is ready to approve a new technology that uses students' fingerprints to keep track of who is riding school buses.
[02:12:17.427 --> 02:12:26.053]  Beginning in the fall, the fingerprint system would identify students as they board and leave, and the goal is to ensure that they are getting on the right bus and getting off at the right stop.
[02:12:26.313 --> 02:12:33.338]  Yes, we must all be... and by the way, a lot of school districts have this, but does it say that that school district has them to get their lunches?
[02:12:33.638 --> 02:12:34.739]  No cash allowed!
[02:12:34.759 --> 02:12:38.862]  I guess cash will be okay now that it's all got cracker chips in it, but...
[02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:42.154]  Well, I haven't read anything about the lunches.
[02:12:42.174 --> 02:12:43.755]  Yeah, well, I know a lot of stuff.
[02:12:43.915 --> 02:12:45.496]  I'm asking, does it have stuff about the lunches?
[02:12:45.596 --> 02:12:46.177]  Obviously not.
[02:12:46.197 --> 02:12:48.358]  Read a little bit more for us, though.
[02:12:48.499 --> 02:12:58.126]  It says, school officials say the $2 million project will save money and dramatically improve safety for students whose fingerprints will serve as an authorization to board and disembark.
[02:12:58.846 --> 02:13:08.654]  If the school board approves the proposal on March 9th, Pinellas will become one of the four Florida school districts in the process of implementing global positioning systems with a student tracking system.
[02:13:09.604 --> 02:13:16.426]  Oh, GPS in the buses as well, and teaching them how to be good little prisoners, you have to sign in and out with your thumb.
[02:13:17.226 --> 02:13:19.967]  Over in England, Paul, I know your libraries are all putting these in.
[02:13:20.007 --> 02:13:23.929]  Got a thumb scan to get a book, and to get into bars they make you do it.
[02:13:24.009 --> 02:13:28.670]  Most bars are now taking DNA swabs out of your cheeks in London for the DNA database.
[02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:31.671]  No matter how insane it sounds, it's really happening, isn't it, Paul?
[02:13:32.251 --> 02:13:34.672]  Yeah, they beta tested a program whereby
[02:13:35.325 --> 02:13:51.095]  DNA swabs would be taken from anyone entering certain bars, and anyone that refused to submit to the DNA swab, they would have police officers on standby to question them for suspicious behavior, and maybe even arrest them, it said.
[02:13:51.435 --> 02:13:52.876]  And that was in the London Telegraph.
[02:13:53.196 --> 02:13:57.079]  Yeah, folks, this is all maximum evil, total insanity, right out in the open.
[02:13:57.579 --> 02:14:00.901]  Stephanie, do you think cameras in school bathrooms are good?
[02:14:02.141 --> 02:14:03.562]  Not in my school, no.
[02:14:03.942 --> 02:14:06.303]  I mean, yeah, back when you were in school, but you're even out of college now.
[02:14:06.343 --> 02:14:08.704]  But, I mean, Stephanie, let's talk about it.
[02:14:08.724 --> 02:14:10.004]  I mean, is that not Big Brother?
[02:14:10.044 --> 02:14:10.725]  Did you ever read 1984?
[02:14:10.805 --> 02:14:12.746]  No, I haven't.
[02:14:13.926 --> 02:14:23.030]  But, I mean, certainly, Stephanie, just to you, just as a layman, you know, average, smart, intelligent young lady, do you think a camera in the school shower is freedom?
[02:14:23.470 --> 02:14:25.311]  Well, no, that's invading my privacy.
[02:14:25.711 --> 02:14:26.992]  Yeah, to the maximum level.
[02:14:27.012 --> 02:14:27.792]  It's uncomfortable, yeah.
[02:14:28.385 --> 02:14:36.069]  What are you going to do when you grow up and have children when they want a thumb scanning to get lunch, thumb scanning to get on the school bus, and the school says, you know, we're going to have cameras in the bathrooms.
[02:14:36.490 --> 02:14:37.490]  Are you going to protest that?
[02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:38.471]  I would, yes.
[02:14:39.031 --> 02:14:39.411]  Good!
[02:14:40.512 --> 02:14:42.933]  Stephanie, you've now joined the ranks of thought criminals.
[02:14:42.953 --> 02:14:43.513]  Well, thank goodness.
[02:14:44.394 --> 02:14:45.715]  Thank you for coming on the show with us.
[02:14:45.755 --> 02:14:46.135]  No problem.
[02:14:46.755 --> 02:14:48.236]  She did a good job there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:48.256 --> 02:14:49.317]  First time Stephanie's been on the show.
[02:14:49.337 --> 02:14:50.357]  I want to start having her on.
[02:14:50.377 --> 02:14:52.919]  Hey, Stephanie, were you loud and clear on the air, though?
[02:14:52.939 --> 02:14:53.999]  You were kind of low on my end.
[02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:56.941]  Okay, I'm sure you were.
[02:14:58.047 --> 02:14:58.527]  All right.
[02:14:59.208 --> 02:15:01.569]  Lord Watson, let's go ahead and take some calls here.
[02:15:02.269 --> 02:15:04.510]  That's my affectionate term for Paul, joking around.
[02:15:05.231 --> 02:15:10.954]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in California.
[02:15:10.994 --> 02:15:11.854]  Dave, thanks for holding.
[02:15:11.894 --> 02:15:12.274]  Go ahead.
[02:15:12.294 --> 02:15:13.915]  Thanks a lot, guys.
[02:15:13.935 --> 02:15:15.676]  I appreciate you taking the call.
[02:15:15.696 --> 02:15:18.617]  I know you have a lot of news to get to, so I'll be brief here.
[02:15:20.078 --> 02:15:21.939]  Truly, I view you guys as patriots.
[02:15:22.199 --> 02:15:27.482]  That call you received earlier this morning was obviously from someone who's completely
[02:15:28.384 --> 02:15:32.606]  Uneducated and unaware of the information that you are putting out there.
[02:15:32.626 --> 02:15:36.248]  Yeah, he was saying he's not going to go out and get violent, but I need to for him.
[02:15:36.848 --> 02:15:45.031]  Right, and it's just ridiculous because the information that you are spreading is definitely the way to go right now.
[02:15:45.852 --> 02:15:51.014]  And for him to say you're doing that for money is absolutely ridiculous.
[02:15:51.545 --> 02:15:52.506]  Well, I mean, it's funny.
[02:15:52.566 --> 02:15:55.408]  I mean, any money I get, I use to fight the New World Order.
[02:15:55.428 --> 02:15:56.609]  I mean, we're not a communist here.
[02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:57.790]  Exactly.
[02:15:57.890 --> 02:16:02.914]  But at the same time, I mean, it's just an insane argument.
[02:16:03.434 --> 02:16:05.416]  But he's just mad because I'm not a leader.
[02:16:05.476 --> 02:16:08.458]  I won't go out and have a violent confrontation with people.
[02:16:08.498 --> 02:16:09.539]  You know, I'm not his leader.
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:11.581]  But you notice he's not out doing it.
[02:16:12.702 --> 02:16:13.422]  I understand.
[02:16:13.502 --> 02:16:16.825]  And my comments are leading to my question right now, which is,
[02:16:17.577 --> 02:16:21.400]  Going back to this non-violent way of spreading information.
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:24.082]  Well, I've got to tell you, I do interviews every day.
[02:16:24.102 --> 02:16:26.344]  The hosts don't ever disagree with me anymore.
[02:16:26.364 --> 02:16:28.125]  All the callers agree.
[02:16:28.185 --> 02:16:29.586]  It's basically all of them now.
[02:16:30.127 --> 02:16:34.830]  Oh, and then I listened to the Colonel's interview last night.
[02:16:34.850 --> 02:16:36.351]  It was just another bombshell.
[02:16:36.712 --> 02:16:38.333]  Just another bombshell on 9-11.
[02:16:38.693 --> 02:16:47.400]  And the mountain of evidence, if you read all of it, I can't understand how you can't
[02:16:49.021 --> 02:16:50.102]  Take that information.
[02:16:50.122 --> 02:17:02.353]  Well, sir, we have the New York Post saying they go grab people's children, CPS does, newborn babies, and they take them and kill them with drug tests and vaccine overdose tests.
[02:17:02.593 --> 02:17:13.503]  They're murdering babies publicly, this is New York Post, publicly, and I've got articles going back years where they tell the families, well, let us test drugs on your child or we'll take them.
[02:17:14.083 --> 02:17:16.264]  And now they just take them and kill them!
[02:17:16.484 --> 02:17:18.285]  They're openly murdering children!
[02:17:18.305 --> 02:17:23.606]  I mean, we have reached a level of just... Paul comments.
[02:17:24.847 --> 02:17:31.049]  Right, he mentioned the Colonel Don Grunn pre-audio interview, which anyone can listen to right now.
[02:17:32.158 --> 02:17:41.324]  We've got more 9-11 news as well, which I just posted a couple of hours ago, which is the ex-Senator Bob Kerry, who is on the board of the 9-11 Investigative Committee.
[02:17:42.784 --> 02:17:44.165]  This is New York Daily News.
[02:17:44.185 --> 02:17:45.366]  He came out and said that
[02:17:45.805 --> 02:17:57.613]  He's about to quit the panel over the fact that the documents are not being released and that he's finding it increasingly difficult to write a report which... And that's all good cop, bad cop.
[02:17:57.693 --> 02:17:59.834]  Later he'll say that they're perfect and need more funding.
[02:17:59.874 --> 02:18:05.417]  It's like Rowley, the fake FBI agent, you know, with the shill when the real FBI guys are going public.
[02:18:05.578 --> 02:18:07.619]  Now she's out saying the Patriot Act's good.
[02:18:07.639 --> 02:18:10.481]  Guys, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[02:18:11.021 --> 02:18:12.462]  Let Paul finish and then I'll come back.
[02:18:13.189 --> 02:18:28.901]  The interesting thing about this New York Daily News article is that this senator said that it's becoming increasingly difficult to write a report based around the fact that 19 men defeated every single defensive system the US put up.
[02:18:29.461 --> 02:18:37.767]  So he's talking about the fact that the line that 19 hijackers did this is impossible, and so this is breaking new ground on the 19th story.
[02:18:37.787 --> 02:18:39.008]  Wow, I wonder what's going on.
[02:18:39.028 --> 02:18:43.211]  I wonder if he'll get an import-export bank chairmanship to shut up.
[02:18:43.251 --> 02:18:45.333]  Maybe he's shaking the tree for an apple.
[02:18:45.833 --> 02:18:47.715]  Let's go back to the caller.
[02:18:47.755 --> 02:18:48.315]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:18:48.335 --> 02:18:57.422]  Yeah, I was just wondering, Alex and Paul, I heard somebody told me that these online petitions, for example, 9-11 for Truth,
[02:18:59.119 --> 02:19:07.183]  In the We The People online petitions, that federal law mandates that online petitions are worthless.
[02:19:09.265 --> 02:19:10.025]  Have you heard of this?
[02:19:10.725 --> 02:19:22.852]  Uh, I know that in some cases they throw it out, in some cases if it's done properly and certified it's being, it's considered good, but I mean I think any exercise in taking action is a good thing.
[02:19:25.656 --> 02:19:26.077]  Thank you.
[02:19:26.097 --> 02:19:26.597]  I appreciate it.
[02:19:26.657 --> 02:19:30.900]  I promise we'll come right back and go to Jack and Elizabeth and Michelle and Steve.
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:32.341]  That'll be it for calls though.
[02:19:32.361 --> 02:19:33.862]  The next five callers will get to you.
[02:19:35.403 --> 02:19:38.885]  I've got like 50 articles here.
[02:19:38.925 --> 02:19:41.107]  I just want to shotgun through them with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:19:41.487 --> 02:19:41.907]  Stay with us.
[02:19:41.927 --> 02:19:42.528]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:45.575 --> 02:19:51.780]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:19:52.240 --> 02:20:00.026]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:20:00.367 --> 02:20:08.213]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:20:08.533 --> 02:20:13.275]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:20:13.615 --> 02:20:18.317]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:20:18.837 --> 02:20:22.679]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:20:23.179 --> 02:20:24.200]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:28.362]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[02:23:48.642 --> 02:23:51.543]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:53.404 --> 02:23:56.305]  Folks, I have a mass of news we haven't gotten to.
[02:23:56.345 --> 02:23:58.026]  A lot of top stories we need to recap.
[02:23:58.346 --> 02:24:02.969]  We got 45 minutes left here on this Monday transmission against tyranny.
[02:24:02.989 --> 02:24:04.129]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:24:04.209 --> 02:24:04.910]  Bam, bam, bam.
[02:24:04.930 --> 02:24:05.990]  You've been holding too long.
[02:24:06.410 --> 02:24:07.871]  Doing a better job lately going to calls.
[02:24:07.911 --> 02:24:09.152]  Today, not too good of a job.
[02:24:09.172 --> 02:24:10.232]  There's just so much here.
[02:24:10.853 --> 02:24:12.754]  And Paul Watson, jump in any time you want to comment.
[02:24:13.054 --> 02:24:14.254]  Elizabeth in Maryland.
[02:24:14.294 --> 02:24:14.655]  Go ahead.
[02:24:14.675 --> 02:24:15.195]  You're on the air.
[02:24:15.751 --> 02:24:16.511]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:24:16.851 --> 02:24:20.593]  And I have a couple points to Paul, and then something for you.
[02:24:20.613 --> 02:24:35.277]  Paul, I was wondering, when I heard the Colonel's interview, he talked about all the planes going into the ocean, and if the cell phones were staged, wasn't one of them talking to his own father, Jeremy Glick?
[02:24:35.618 --> 02:24:37.078]  How do you suppose that happened?
[02:24:37.638 --> 02:24:38.959]  Well, that was a very short call.
[02:24:38.999 --> 02:24:42.820]  That's what we've heard from the government, of, oh, let's roll on all this business.
[02:24:43.730 --> 02:24:50.012]  But if you look at, look, you have four planes, all magically, two different companies, only 20% occupancy.
[02:24:50.332 --> 02:24:51.292]  We looked at the numbers.
[02:24:52.052 --> 02:24:58.274]  The planes were running at 94% occupancy for the top ten airlines in the Eastern Corridor that day.
[02:24:58.474 --> 02:25:05.016]  But magically, these four have two software glitches on four separate planes, exactly 20% occupancy.
[02:25:06.816 --> 02:25:13.903]  We've got people who have been critical of the New World Order and Clinton, who have written books disappearing and dying.
[02:25:13.923 --> 02:25:18.147]  We have this FBI agent who blown the whistle dying at the scene of the towers.
[02:25:18.667 --> 02:25:23.812]  All these convenient deaths and disappearances were either in the buildings or on the planes.
[02:25:24.272 --> 02:25:27.716]  This comes from aircraft carriers, from reports.
[02:25:28.096 --> 02:25:30.218]  The planes went out or ditched in the ocean.
[02:25:31.187 --> 02:25:42.742]  Then, by remote control themselves, so we add all this together, this is what the Colonel is getting from his sources inside the Pentagon, and then it matches with the public info we've got.
[02:25:42.982 --> 02:25:43.984]  Paul Watson, comments.
[02:25:44.818 --> 02:25:55.747]  Well, yeah, if you think that the government can't fake cell phone calls when for, you know, 20 years they've been faking videos of people saying things, then you've got to be pretty naive, but... Well, take Northwoods.
[02:25:55.827 --> 02:26:02.492]  Northwoods says we can have a real or simulated plane hijack it, crash it in the ocean, and say all aboard were killed.
[02:26:02.693 --> 02:26:10.459]  They said we could do it with real or staged students, have military people board aircrafts, everybody sees them leave, you understand?
[02:26:10.679 --> 02:26:11.700]  That's in Northwoods.
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:20.223]  Well, with the cell phone calls, we've got the flight attendant, Betty Ong, who we're supposed to believe is relating the story of what's going on.
[02:26:20.563 --> 02:26:27.786]  There is absolutely no noise in the background of this cell phone, and suddenly she says, oh, I see water, I see buildings, and then nothing.
[02:26:28.006 --> 02:26:29.647]  And so people are supposed to believe that
[02:26:30.007 --> 02:26:33.490]  During this chaos, nobody would be screaming in the background.
[02:26:33.530 --> 02:26:39.194]  Well, it's like a fat bin Laden sitting there going, ha ha, I get you, ha ha!
[02:26:39.274 --> 02:26:47.219]  And then they show video, two years old, of people they admit are dead and captured and go, look, there's Zhawai's back threatening you again!
[02:26:47.239 --> 02:26:47.860]  I mean, it's just...
[02:26:48.420 --> 02:26:58.267]  Well, we had a group of people that devoted a website to the fact that you can't make cell phone calls from, you know, that high up altitude-wise.
[02:26:58.367 --> 02:27:08.113]  They made a whole website out of it and gave everyone the facts, which would confirm that you cannot make cell phone calls from the height of which the government said these cell phone calls were made.
[02:27:08.133 --> 02:27:12.016]  Let's just say I know people who've tried to sneak into it and your phone doesn't work.
[02:27:15.481 --> 02:27:16.982]  Does that answer your question, Elizabeth?
[02:27:17.042 --> 02:27:17.563]  Yes, it does.
[02:27:17.603 --> 02:27:20.685]  And there was one other thing that I would like to ask about.
[02:27:20.785 --> 02:27:30.892]  I think the colonel said something that there was almost a coup d'etat during the time we were in Kosovo, and I thought he said, Clinton saved us.
[02:27:31.253 --> 02:27:35.356]  Now, how does that go with the information that... He didn't say Clinton saved us.
[02:27:36.565 --> 02:27:36.825]  No.
[02:27:37.125 --> 02:27:39.046]  Alright, I thought that's what I heard.
[02:27:40.026 --> 02:27:44.127]  That Admiral Borda, you know, was killed and some flag officers were shot.
[02:27:44.167 --> 02:27:45.348]  No, thanks for the call, Lisbeth.
[02:27:45.368 --> 02:27:46.628]  He never said that good to hear from you.
[02:27:47.228 --> 02:27:49.569]  Let's talk to Jack in Colorado.
[02:27:49.629 --> 02:27:50.489]  Jack, thanks for holding.
[02:27:50.509 --> 02:27:50.929]  Go ahead.
[02:27:51.449 --> 02:27:53.370]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex and Paul.
[02:27:53.530 --> 02:27:56.171]  I want to make a few comments and then you can comment on them.
[02:27:56.691 --> 02:28:03.173]  One is, you're doing a good job and I think you already said it, but you should maybe say it more clearly that that caller earlier
[02:28:03.712 --> 02:28:11.014]  It's most likely an agent provocateur and we shouldn't be sucked in by those kind of invitations to incriminate ourselves.
[02:28:11.595 --> 02:28:20.238]  Secondly, I would like to hear you talk about the FTAA, which is our new roadmap to world government.
[02:28:20.518 --> 02:28:27.760]  Well, yeah, I mean, the EU started as a trade deal, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, unifying Social Security, laws, foreign troops, end of everything.
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:30.841]  Yeah, ten times worse, they're saying, than NAFTA and GATT.
[02:28:31.081 --> 02:28:33.222]  Paul, you want to comment on the Free Trade Area of the Americas?
[02:28:34.005 --> 02:28:35.306]  Yeah, that's basically what it is.
[02:28:35.366 --> 02:28:48.854]  It's an amalgamation of all the Americas, and it mirrors that of the European Union, which did start off as a free trade deal under the Maastricht Treaty, was planned from the very first Bilderberg meeting.
[02:28:48.894 --> 02:28:50.275]  They've now released those minutes.
[02:28:50.755 --> 02:29:01.842]  Yeah, the BBC went in at the last Bilderberg meeting, went into the library, got the records, and they were shocked to hear, although they still couched it as all conspiracy theory, that Bilderberg had planned
[02:29:02.362 --> 02:29:09.451]  Not only the European Union, which is, you know, the mirror of the free trade area of the Americas, but also the single euro currency.
[02:29:09.731 --> 02:29:14.316]  This was before even the European Union as a trade area was talked about.
[02:29:14.336 --> 02:29:15.558]  This was in the early fifties.
[02:29:16.038 --> 02:29:19.402]  So everybody, please visit StopTheFTAA.org.
[02:29:21.067 --> 02:29:23.188]  All right, yeah, we need to cover more of that.
[02:29:23.288 --> 02:29:24.428]  Need to get some grips on.
[02:29:24.448 --> 02:29:28.369]  Any guests you want, just tipsandinfowars.com.
[02:29:28.649 --> 02:29:29.309]  Paul, stay there.
[02:29:29.369 --> 02:29:31.850]  More calls, three more calls, and total news blitz.
[02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:32.430]  Stay with me!
[02:29:35.891 --> 02:29:36.791]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.271 --> 02:29:38.912]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.812 --> 02:29:42.493]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:45.839 --> 02:29:50.560]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:29:50.780 --> 02:29:54.221]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:29:54.441 --> 02:29:56.902]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:29:57.142 --> 02:30:05.744]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:30:06.104 --> 02:30:11.885]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:30:12.165 --> 02:30:14.107]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[02:30:14.347 --> 02:30:21.294]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[02:30:21.634 --> 02:30:28.101]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[02:30:28.361 --> 02:30:35.688]  That's right, for a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[02:30:35.928 --> 02:30:40.394]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[02:30:40.494 --> 02:30:40.694]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:30:40.734 --> 02:30:42.356]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[02:30:46.952 --> 02:30:47.352]  Burr!
[02:30:47.532 --> 02:30:49.553]  Record cold spells gripping the nation this winter.
[02:30:49.673 --> 02:30:50.773]  So much for global warming.
[02:30:50.973 --> 02:30:55.115]  Of course, hand-in-hand with record cold spells usually go record fuel bills for heating.
[02:30:55.135 --> 02:30:58.136]  But for thousands of people across the country, there's no record fuel bill.
[02:30:58.316 --> 02:30:59.576]  In fact, there's no bill at all.
[02:30:59.736 --> 02:31:06.199]  These people have discovered the magic of a warm workshop without the cost by burning waste oil with a waste oil heater kit from Harold Electric.
[02:31:06.419 --> 02:31:09.039]  We all enjoy having a comfortable shop in the winter months to work in.
[02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:16.002]  And a waste oil heater from Harold Electric can turn your waste oil from a liability into an incredibly efficient and economical way to heat your workshop.
[02:31:16.462 --> 02:31:17.642]  Waste oil heater burns clean.
[02:31:17.823 --> 02:31:21.064]  So clean, in fact, that there's absolutely no visible smoke while it's running.
[02:31:21.184 --> 02:31:22.264]  There's no expensive maintenance.
[02:31:22.384 --> 02:31:25.226]  And the waste oil heaters from Harold Electric are easy to operate.
[02:31:25.386 --> 02:31:30.388]  With heating costs skyrocketing in the past couple of years, adding a waste oil heater in your shop makes perfect sense.
[02:31:30.608 --> 02:31:33.829]  And with a waste oil heater kit you build yourself from Harold Electric, it's easy.

[02:31:45.834 --> 02:31:46.855]  Are you losing your hair?
[02:31:47.196 --> 02:31:48.617]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[02:31:48.957 --> 02:31:50.058]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[02:31:50.639 --> 02:31:52.261]  Why aren't you using Avocor?
[02:31:52.481 --> 02:31:56.965]  The hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people just like you regrow their hair.
[02:31:57.286 --> 02:31:58.807]  I am 39 years old.
[02:31:59.067 --> 02:32:01.390]  I've been slowly balding over the last 10 years.
[02:32:01.530 --> 02:32:04.973]  Thanks to Avocor, my hair is coming back and I couldn't be more excited.
[02:32:05.093 --> 02:32:06.715]  The best product that I've tried.
[02:32:06.875 --> 02:32:08.897]  Avocor is the product of the 21st century.

[02:32:24.007 --> 02:32:24.527]  That's 800-397-7234.
[02:32:24.627 --> 02:32:26.028]  Regrow your hair with Avocor.
[02:32:26.088 --> 02:32:26.228]  Call 800-397-7234.
[02:32:26.248 --> 02:32:26.869]  Order Avocor today.
[02:32:56.696 --> 02:33:01.918]  Okay, we're about to go to Michelle, Steve, and Michael, and then that's it for calls.
[02:33:01.938 --> 02:33:07.441]  Got a bunch of news, but a caller in the last hour, Rod, called in and
[02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:33.344]  Rod was saying that, you know, well, what I got from it, and you'll hear it rebroadcast tonight at the second hour, in the 10 o'clock hour, what I got from it was, is that Rod was saying, you know, you know, you walk the line, you don't call for, you know, let's go and have an armed confrontation, and I disagree with that, and then he went off into some other issues, but certainly there's a time to defend your family.
[02:33:34.193 --> 02:33:36.754]  These globalists deserve to be put in prison.
[02:33:36.774 --> 02:33:38.854]  You know, we have a right to defend ourselves.
[02:33:38.874 --> 02:33:39.554]  They're pure evil.
[02:33:39.874 --> 02:33:48.016]  My point is, is that in a Machiavellian worldview, they win when we get violent if the people don't know why we're standing up.
[02:33:48.356 --> 02:33:50.837]  So we have to go through the committees of correspondence first.
[02:33:51.337 --> 02:33:52.937]  So, Rod, I said call back in.
[02:33:52.957 --> 02:33:54.097]  Now go ahead and finish your points.
[02:33:54.277 --> 02:34:01.899]  Okay, well, all I was going to say, and I know I did not say anything about armed revolution, I just said that at one time, I believe there was an incident
[02:34:02.458 --> 02:34:17.607]  Mark Cornicky mentioned this, that it had something to do with what he called the Mop Bucket Brigade, which I think if, you know, a handful of us went out there and did that with KC, that would bring a lot of press.
[02:34:17.927 --> 02:34:20.969]  Now, yeah, they may characterize us as coots.
[02:34:21.636 --> 02:34:24.557]  But then again, I think that would be much more effective.
[02:34:24.597 --> 02:34:30.660]  And that's Casey Nethercott, Rancho Rescue, no crime, using the Patriot Act to arrest him at 2.30.
[02:34:31.020 --> 02:34:36.322]  In fact, Casey's going to call in in the last segment while I'm trying to speed through this, and we're going to get an update.
[02:34:36.422 --> 02:34:43.525]  If we were just out there standing with my bucket, the press would be out there, believe me, and they would be wondering, you know, what's going on?
[02:34:44.386 --> 02:34:49.888]  And, you know, perhaps, you know, we could make people aware, but just by trying to call our congressmen
[02:34:50.330 --> 02:34:51.771]  Or call the governor or whatever.
[02:34:51.831 --> 02:34:55.133]  That's not going to do any good, Alex.
[02:34:55.233 --> 02:34:57.875]  Actually, it does do good quite a bit when they know we're watching them.
[02:34:58.075 --> 02:35:01.057]  Well, look, I'm glad we're all friendly and that's good to hear from you.
[02:35:01.337 --> 02:35:02.558]  You can call back any time, Ron.
[02:35:02.578 --> 02:35:05.359]  You know that phones are wide open for folks here.
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:07.921]  Real quick, let's get to these calls.
[02:35:08.541 --> 02:35:10.142]  Let's talk to Michelle in Arizona.
[02:35:10.162 --> 02:35:11.003]  Michelle, go ahead.
[02:35:11.696 --> 02:35:14.518]  Hi, this is actually my first time calling.
[02:35:14.538 --> 02:35:15.519]  I'm a first time listener.
[02:35:15.559 --> 02:35:17.161]  Well, thanks for holding for the last hour.
[02:35:17.541 --> 02:35:18.381]  Not a problem.
[02:35:18.442 --> 02:35:29.330]  I just wanted to say that I was turned on to you from a friend and this is great information that you provide as well as the guests that come on your show about what's going on in the world today.
[02:35:29.751 --> 02:35:33.674]  And I really appreciate you all putting that information, especially about what's going on with the
[02:35:34.059 --> 02:35:39.566]  Well, absolutely, and I've got articles where people are sending emails, people hacking, people with pot, topless bar owners, county commissioners.
[02:35:50.820 --> 02:36:01.468]  Casey Nethercote, they sent him a letter, turn yourself in and the National Guard is going to come get you, you don't get a lawyer, you don't get a phone, we're going to put you back in solitary confinement for no reason because you're exposing the open border.
[02:36:01.488 --> 02:36:04.450]  I mean, they're really doing this to him!
[02:36:04.730 --> 02:36:06.951]  They're really doing this to us!
[02:36:08.132 --> 02:36:16.458]  And it's just so frustrating that when you put the information out there, people just don't take the information and take action to it unless it hits very close to home.
[02:36:17.119 --> 02:36:19.302]  Well, I mean, what do you think about this New York Post article?
[02:36:19.322 --> 02:36:21.023]  I mean, my wife started crying this morning.
[02:36:27.972 --> 02:36:30.773]  Another advanced form of slavery.
[02:36:31.294 --> 02:36:35.896]  It is, but I mean, this is... I mean, everybody's mad about Tuskegee, which was horrible.
[02:36:36.176 --> 02:36:40.739]  You know, letting men die of syphilis, not treating them for 45 years.
[02:36:40.979 --> 02:36:43.900]  This is babies, and they're killing them, and they admit it.
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:51.984]  They take them, they kill them, they test things on them, the doctors are saying it's killing them, and then they just say, we're going to keep doing it because we don't care, because we're the government.
[02:36:52.525 --> 02:36:52.965]  Exactly.
[02:36:53.025 --> 02:36:55.186]  I mean, this makes me sick.
[02:36:55.286 --> 02:36:56.106]  It makes me sick.
[02:36:56.126 --> 02:36:57.027]  Does it make you sick?
[02:36:57.407 --> 02:37:01.349]  Yes, it definitely makes me sick to see that happen to the defense of children.
[02:37:02.109 --> 02:37:09.593]  And it shouldn't be done like that, and I appreciate the information that you put on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars, which is a great website.
[02:37:09.973 --> 02:37:12.374]  It's a lot of information, and that's what I plan on doing.
[02:37:12.414 --> 02:37:16.156]  I plan on passing that along to as many people as there are that want to hear and want to act.
[02:37:16.196 --> 02:37:17.516]  So I thank you and your guests.
[02:37:17.836 --> 02:37:20.138]  Hey, Michelle, it's good to hear from you.
[02:37:20.178 --> 02:37:20.618]  Call back.
[02:37:20.658 --> 02:37:21.958]  Don't just be a first-time caller.
[02:37:21.978 --> 02:37:25.320]  You know, we love everybody out there that loves goodness and hates evil.
[02:37:26.884 --> 02:37:29.826]  I'm telling you folks, I get sick at my stomach over this.
[02:37:29.886 --> 02:37:31.348]  Paul Watson, you got any comments?
[02:37:32.749 --> 02:37:41.257]  With the forced vaccination of the babies, how is this any different from North Korea, where they have 200,000 people in concentration camps?
[02:37:41.949 --> 02:37:49.493]  Uh, when somebody gets pregnant, they take the baby, do bio-chemical tests on it, stamp the babies to death.
[02:37:49.813 --> 02:37:53.995]  This is all admitted, and yes, it's going on, but the point is it's going on in this country as well.
[02:37:54.416 --> 02:37:58.918]  And, you know, North Korea's a Stalinist dictatorship, so how much better is...
[02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:13.762]  And I want folks to understand, this isn't just last week, ABC News, the 2,000 documents of an internal CDC meeting where the top scientists say, we're not going to give our kids this, massive brain damage, millions of children, and then they say, well, we've got to cover this up.
[02:38:14.568 --> 02:38:15.529]  We're going to continue.
[02:38:15.949 --> 02:38:16.830]  It's not just that.
[02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:20.133]  It's not just they know what they're doing and trying to make us do it.
[02:38:20.373 --> 02:38:27.840]  This is where CPS grabs the toddler, grabs the newborn, and tests experimental overloads of vaccines on them.
[02:38:28.140 --> 02:38:29.401]  Kills them!
[02:38:29.481 --> 02:38:30.822]  It says, kills them!
[02:38:31.083 --> 02:38:32.284]  Killing babies!
[02:38:32.524 --> 02:38:33.845]  And they're going to keep doing it!
[02:38:35.066 --> 02:38:35.647]  Bastards!
[02:38:37.213 --> 02:39:06.194]  Same thing with the MMR situation in Britain, where the government launched a campaign which was publicly funded by them to convince everyone that the triple jab vaccine was safe, when babies across the board have been having, you know, autism, bowel disorder, babies dying from this, and yet the government says... 25 years ago, 1 out of 24,000 had it, now it's 1 out of 168, that's not counting all the other brain diseases, and the CDC says, we know it's happening, we've got to cover it up!
[02:39:07.228 --> 02:39:07.929]  Bastards!
[02:39:08.109 --> 02:39:11.533]  I'm sorry, you are, you are, you are the spawn of hell!
[02:39:11.553 --> 02:39:14.056]  You, you bureaucrats and yuppies!
[02:39:14.096 --> 02:39:17.721]  You just, for twenty pieces of silver, you'd do anything, you people!
[02:39:18.914 --> 02:39:27.377]  And also with the ADHD, with the stuff they put in the food, the stuff they put in the vaccines, 1 in 7 in Britain have attention deficit disorder.
[02:39:27.417 --> 02:39:39.620]  And by the way, Aldous Huxley's brother ran the UN UNESCO and said he wanted to do this and dumb us down, and Huxley said in 62 before his death at Berkeley, he said, I wrote this book from government documents, this is what they plan to do to you by 2000.
[02:39:39.740 --> 02:39:44.962]  It's literally like x-raying the eggs to have a dumbed down mass, Paul.
[02:39:46.024 --> 02:39:53.357]  Yeah, the solution after that that the government proposes is, again, more drugs, more Soma, Prozac, with the ADHD.
[02:39:53.377 --> 02:39:55.000]  Did you know they even have a drug called Soma?
[02:39:55.962 --> 02:39:56.222]  Yeah.
[02:39:56.603 --> 02:39:57.965]  We had an ad on the network for it.
[02:39:58.005 --> 02:39:58.987]  I mean, I couldn't believe it.
[02:39:59.699 --> 02:40:03.382]  And they've got surveillance databases called the Matrix.
[02:40:04.582 --> 02:40:08.625]  We've got a drug that blocks your mind out.
[02:40:09.186 --> 02:40:10.026]  It's called Soma.
[02:40:11.507 --> 02:40:16.231]  And by the way, we've got a system that watches everything you do called Matrix.
[02:40:16.331 --> 02:40:18.312]  I mean, folks, come on!
[02:40:18.372 --> 02:40:19.413]  Come on!
[02:40:22.875 --> 02:40:23.195]  You know what?
[02:40:23.215 --> 02:40:26.678]  The New York Post just comes out and says, well, and the government says, well, we grab them and kill them.
[02:40:26.738 --> 02:40:27.779]  It's just we kill children.
[02:40:30.442 --> 02:40:40.407]  It's like ABC News reported that up until the late 70s, people were sterilized if they got below a B plus on their scorecard, and that's admitted as well.
[02:40:40.807 --> 02:40:43.948]  Until 1985 in Oregon, but yeah, I quit most areas by 79.
[02:40:45.229 --> 02:40:46.429]  I've had the people on!
[02:40:46.449 --> 02:40:55.594]  I mean, it's been in the news that, well, I made a B minus and my mom was on welfare, so they took me and the medical students, you know, while I was awake, cut my organs out, you know.
[02:40:55.634 --> 02:40:58.415]  That's how the Holocaust started, with the Nazis, they took
[02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:00.481]  mentally disabled children.
[02:41:00.521 --> 02:41:04.003]  They were the first victims which created the pretext to do it to everybody else.
[02:41:04.124 --> 02:41:08.406]  And now we got Dr. Peter Singer saying we should kill babies up to two years old.
[02:41:08.426 --> 02:41:11.188]  It's a nightmare.
[02:41:11.709 --> 02:41:12.449]  People don't believe it.
[02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:14.030]  I had Wesley Smith on for the Wall Street Journal.
[02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:18.273]  He'll list the names of people begging for food, chained down, being killed.
[02:41:19.233 --> 02:41:24.277]  And then the government puts out the propaganda that the euthanasia culture is loving and kind.
[02:41:25.237 --> 02:41:25.818]  Loving!
[02:41:27.179 --> 02:41:36.643]  Never mind our enforcers wear black ski masks and carry submachine guns and have skull and crossbones decals on their vehicles, that's always a good sign!
[02:41:36.823 --> 02:41:43.406]  The good guys wear black masks and huge trudgeons and drive vehicles with skulls on them, Paul!
[02:41:44.046 --> 02:41:56.692]  Yeah, so it's death mandated by the state, Soylent Green, Brave New World, 1984, any dystopian fiction that you can imagine, every single one combined and ten times worse is what we're living in today.
[02:41:57.304 --> 02:42:00.727]  The only thing they're not doing is mass arrest of innocent people for no reason.
[02:42:00.867 --> 02:42:05.590]  They don't have enough police to go out and force it, enough sicko lawyers, enough truly evil judges.
[02:42:05.771 --> 02:42:08.573]  They've just got pockets of wickedness doing it selectively.
[02:42:09.473 --> 02:42:15.478]  Yeah, they've learned the lesson that to go out in that boot-in-your-face style does not work because it's a visceral experience.
[02:42:15.538 --> 02:42:23.244]  People can see what's going on so they just do it subtly and behind the scenes and let it grow and grow and grow and then people don't realize until it's too late.
[02:42:23.705 --> 02:42:25.126]  That's it, let's talk to
[02:42:26.161 --> 02:42:27.221]  Steve in Pennsylvania.
[02:42:27.241 --> 02:42:27.941]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:42:28.421 --> 02:42:30.242]  Oh yes, hello Alex and Paul.
[02:42:30.542 --> 02:42:30.862]  Hello.
[02:42:33.242 --> 02:42:39.083]  That caller that called in, it made me wonder where he'd exactly be at today without the knowledge that you passed out.
[02:42:41.604 --> 02:42:45.165]  But beyond that, last week my father missed it and I missed it.
[02:42:45.265 --> 02:42:47.965]  I was having a hard time picking you up on my grundig living in a trailer.
[02:42:47.985 --> 02:42:52.086]  What was the results of West Virginia and New Mexico?
[02:42:53.238 --> 02:42:58.440]  Uh, it's still in the Senate, past the House, to make everyone blow breathalyzers is to use your vehicle.
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:05.862]  Uh, and in West Virginia, the bill's still there, pending, to make everyone take vaccines under, quote, a federal mandate.
[02:43:06.543 --> 02:43:06.803]  Oh, gosh.
[02:43:06.823 --> 02:43:08.303]  Alright, hey, thanks.
[02:43:08.823 --> 02:43:09.724]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[02:43:09.764 --> 02:43:11.484]  Yeah, just mass evil, folks.
[02:43:12.365 --> 02:43:14.345]  Uh, let's, uh, talk to Michael in Virginia.
[02:43:14.385 --> 02:43:14.945]  Last caller.
[02:43:14.985 --> 02:43:15.586]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:43:16.006 --> 02:43:16.466]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:16.686 --> 02:43:19.567]  Uh, first-time caller I've been listening to for quite some time.
[02:43:20.387 --> 02:43:22.468]  Um, I've been researching the New World Order,
[02:43:23.132 --> 02:43:23.232]  Sure.
[02:43:40.888 --> 02:43:44.251]  You had a picture of Anton LaVey with John Kerry.
[02:43:44.531 --> 02:43:48.074]  Yeah, and we don't know if that's an accurate poll, so we're trying to find out.
[02:43:48.414 --> 02:43:59.723]  Okay, because I actually posted it on a message board, and we've been talking about it on this message board, and one of the guys says that it mentions John Kerry as a congressman, and it's supposed to be from 1982.
[02:44:00.163 --> 02:44:03.126]  However, John Kerry wasn't even a congressman until 1985.
[02:44:06.918 --> 02:44:08.539]  No, he was a congressman.
[02:44:08.579 --> 02:44:11.622]  He says he's been in over 20 years in Congress.
[02:44:12.042 --> 02:44:17.767]  Well, I checked it up on John Kerry's own website, and it says that he was elected to Congress in 1985.
[02:44:18.087 --> 02:44:30.957]  Yeah, Paul brought that up in the last hour, that what they do is we have all this real stuff out there, and then they'll put out this info to then be discredited, and then, oh, I heard that isn't true, he isn't a member of Skull & Bones.
[02:44:31.317 --> 02:44:32.618]  So we'll try to get to the bottom of it.
[02:44:33.219 --> 02:44:34.300]  Okay, alright, thanks.
[02:44:35.575 --> 02:44:36.436]  That's pretty much it.
[02:44:36.456 --> 02:44:39.377]  We were just trying to figure out whether it was a real image.
[02:44:39.437 --> 02:44:40.638]  Well, it sure looks real.
[02:44:41.078 --> 02:44:42.038]  It does.
[02:44:42.159 --> 02:44:42.819]  You got that right.
[02:44:43.479 --> 02:44:44.340]  Keep up the good work.
[02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:45.200]  You bet.
[02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:46.741]  We're trying to investigate that.
[02:44:46.781 --> 02:44:48.142]  We know Skull & Bones is real.
[02:44:48.162 --> 02:44:49.182]  We know it's satanic.
[02:44:49.723 --> 02:44:50.403]  Paul, comments?
[02:44:51.249 --> 02:44:52.090]  Yeah, well that's the point.
[02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:58.497]  I will try and throw these things in and muddy the water, but at least we're not going to shy away from the situation and ignore it.
[02:44:58.557 --> 02:45:04.983]  If we do find out that it is fake and we have verifiable evidence, then we will add that to the article and make that known to everyone.
[02:45:05.003 --> 02:45:10.269]  Well, we never found out of that article last week with the Jewish group once Mel Gibson arrested under Patriot Act.
[02:45:11.248 --> 02:45:12.229]  That looked fake to me.
[02:45:12.289 --> 02:45:13.610]  I couldn't find the Capital Press.
[02:45:13.650 --> 02:45:14.131]  Couldn't find it.
[02:45:14.151 --> 02:45:16.312]  I said up front, everybody else was saying it was real.
[02:45:16.653 --> 02:45:17.633]  I said, I think this is fake.
[02:45:17.793 --> 02:45:19.795]  And never saw it proven one way or the other.
[02:45:20.115 --> 02:45:25.479]  But I have AFP, which is real, official, where they have banned it in France.
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:29.402]  So it has been banned as anti-Semitic in France.
[02:45:30.283 --> 02:45:32.565]  Or could cause anti-Semitism.
[02:45:33.374 --> 02:45:39.616]  So, the bottom line is that both Kerry and Bush admitted to Skull and Bones membership on Meet the Press.
[02:45:39.636 --> 02:45:43.457]  They both have the textbook identical same answer to the question.
[02:45:43.497 --> 02:45:45.218]  It's so secret, we can't talk about it, you know.
[02:45:45.618 --> 02:45:47.839]  Reading from the script, and so we know that's true.
[02:45:48.059 --> 02:45:53.941]  So we didn't even need this, but if it does turn out to be false, then we'll make that known to everybody who visits the website.
[02:45:54.477 --> 02:45:56.018]  Yeah, I'd like to know who's putting this stuff out.
[02:45:56.718 --> 02:45:57.238]  Here's another one.
[02:45:57.258 --> 02:45:58.199]  City Morning Herald.
[02:45:58.299 --> 02:45:59.199]  Strange concept.
[02:45:59.219 --> 02:46:01.620]  This car dobs you in the speed camera.
[02:46:02.541 --> 02:46:05.762]  Disputing a speed camera fine could soon be a thing of the past today.
[02:46:05.822 --> 02:46:12.345]  Toyota will unveil a car that takes away the guesswork when it comes to identifying the lead foot in the family.
[02:46:12.425 --> 02:46:17.687]  Finding the right recipient of the ticket could be as simple as sliding a mobile phone-style semi-card.
[02:46:18.028 --> 02:46:20.989]  Instead of a key, the card would contain details of driver's license and address.
[02:46:21.489 --> 02:46:24.470]  And it goes into, you know, if you haven't paid your tickets, you can't start your car.
[02:46:24.990 --> 02:46:26.970]  Basically, the neocon start piece.
[02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:28.891]  In fact, Stephanie, get that ready for me, please.
[02:46:31.371 --> 02:46:36.013]  And it says, telemetrics are going to be part of our future, whether we like it or not.
[02:46:36.873 --> 02:46:43.254]  It said, telemetric systems are no trivial matter, according to project manager Paul Berenger.
[02:46:43.894 --> 02:46:48.756]  And so we're all, again, the satellite trackers, boxes already in the cars, want to make it the law.
[02:46:49.096 --> 02:46:49.996]  Comments on this, Paul?
[02:46:50.669 --> 02:47:01.199]  Well, we had the program exactly a year ago now which kicked off in Scotland and London whereby the system would read your number plate and then feed it back to a centralized database.
[02:47:01.239 --> 02:47:06.645]  If you didn't pay the tax then you would be brought to punishment and at the time I said
[02:47:07.225 --> 02:47:10.510]  Because the media was saying at the time that this was going to be a complete mess.
[02:47:10.570 --> 02:47:11.691]  It's not going to be successful.
[02:47:11.732 --> 02:47:14.796]  And then the answer is going to be satellite crackers.
[02:47:15.276 --> 02:47:24.129]  Yeah, and it's going to be rolled out on a worldwide basis, and that's exactly what the policy plan has said two months after it was introduced, which I predicted again at the time.
[02:47:24.907 --> 02:47:27.389]  All right, in fact, this isn't even a joke anymore.
[02:47:27.429 --> 02:47:36.034]  Breathalyzers for all of us to start our cars, all students drug tested, the hover blimps are being deployed 30 times the size of the Goodyear blimp, looking for your walls.
[02:47:36.554 --> 02:47:38.516]  Here it is, NeoconSTAR, the future.
[02:47:38.796 --> 02:47:48.062]  The following is an actual conversation between a NeoconSTAR operator and a subscriber in distress who is locked in her car and doesn't have the proper authorization to get out.
[02:47:48.582 --> 02:47:51.384]  With NeoconSTAR, help is just a satellite away.
[02:47:53.666 --> 02:47:56.868]  Neoconstar, how can I offer you great service today?
[02:47:57.048 --> 02:47:59.329]  Please help me, I'm trapped in my car!
[02:47:59.409 --> 02:48:01.250]  My retina scanner won't work!
[02:48:01.490 --> 02:48:02.631]  Just relax, sir.
[02:48:02.751 --> 02:48:04.472]  It's not sir, it's ma'am!
[02:48:04.572 --> 02:48:06.273]  Please hurry, it's hot in here!
[02:48:06.513 --> 02:48:11.295]  According to Admiral Poindexter's database, I have you at the Monsanto Mart on 2nd Street.
[02:48:11.415 --> 02:48:11.695]  Right.
[02:48:12.016 --> 02:48:16.378]  I have a live shot of you from the Neoconstar Observation Blimp in your area.
[02:48:16.518 --> 02:48:17.698]  I'm an old lady!
[02:48:17.718 --> 02:48:20.480]  Alright sir, looks like you have no outstanding warrant.
[02:48:34.411 --> 02:48:34.711]  By the way,
[02:49:03.282 --> 02:49:11.229]  In China, in one province, they have 24 mobile death vans with automatic injectors and they gut you in the back with the delicious fresh organs.
[02:49:12.029 --> 02:49:13.991]  And then ship those over here, of course, publicly.
[02:49:14.892 --> 02:49:16.693]  Paul, another story here.
[02:49:16.773 --> 02:49:18.795]  Bush accused of supporting Haitian rebels.
[02:49:19.235 --> 02:49:20.376]  Not a press international.
[02:49:20.396 --> 02:49:23.258]  Even the rebels that have taken over said they were supported by the CIA.
[02:49:23.579 --> 02:49:25.740]  You notice they all have nice new M-16s.
[02:49:26.341 --> 02:49:27.522]  What do you think's going on there?
[02:49:28.484 --> 02:49:30.467]  Well, it's yet another CIA coup.
[02:49:30.688 --> 02:49:39.001]  The rebel group, the Cannibal Army, which under its previous incarnation, the FRAPH, were responsible for 5,000 murders in Haiti.
[02:49:41.523 --> 02:49:41.983]  I think?
[02:49:58.829 --> 02:49:59.630]  Yes, I think so.
[02:50:15.513 --> 02:50:17.373]  It's also being backed by the U.N.
[02:50:17.413 --> 02:50:24.255]  and France against cracking the myth that they're not working in lockstep with these military colonizations with the U.S.
[02:50:24.315 --> 02:50:24.695]  government.
[02:50:24.735 --> 02:50:32.297]  So, just like in Venezuela, when the CIA support the terrorists to overthrow Chavez, it's another CIA-backed military coup.
[02:50:33.137 --> 02:50:33.697]  Absolutely.
[02:50:33.737 --> 02:50:35.157]  Paul Watson, great job.
[02:50:35.177 --> 02:50:36.838]  Thanks for being with us today, my friend.
[02:50:37.158 --> 02:50:37.518]  Thank you.
[02:50:37.918 --> 02:50:38.398]  Great job.
[02:50:38.438 --> 02:50:39.878]  WebmasterofPrisonPlanet.com.
[02:50:39.898 --> 02:50:40.578]  Check it out today.
[02:50:40.598 --> 02:50:43.839]  We'll be back with the final segment, Key News, and Casey Nethercutt.
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:46.581]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[02:50:46.821 --> 02:50:49.122]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:50:49.242 --> 02:50:49.943]  You heard that right.
[02:50:50.023 --> 02:50:52.504]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:50:52.664 --> 02:50:53.585]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:50:53.845 --> 02:50:55.126]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:50:55.406 --> 02:50:56.967]  Now is the time to fight back.
[02:50:57.207 --> 02:50:59.909]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[02:51:00.129 --> 02:51:03.831]  The procedure is easy, and everything is done legally and within the law.
[02:51:04.031 --> 02:51:05.412]  Almost no one has ever failed.
[02:51:05.592 --> 02:51:08.974]  Check out 1-2-3 Nodet.com.
[02:51:09.194 --> 02:51:12.436]  You can also wipe out your mortgage debt and get a free and clear title.
[02:51:12.676 --> 02:51:15.437]  Mortgage elimination is usually completed in 2 or 3 months.
[02:51:15.717 --> 02:51:18.359]  It's done by an outside source found on our website.
[02:51:18.479 --> 02:51:22.921]  Believe it or not, mortgage debt elimination has been done for thousands for more than 10 years.
[02:51:23.081 --> 02:51:24.762]  Don't let the banksters cheat you.
[02:51:24.782 --> 02:51:25.662]  Fight back America.
[02:51:25.742 --> 02:51:26.623]  Stop the fraud.
[02:51:26.783 --> 02:51:27.623]  Stop the rip-off.
[02:51:27.923 --> 02:51:28.844]  Learn the truth.
[02:51:30.225 --> 02:51:32.507]  1-2-3 Nodet.com.
[02:51:32.627 --> 02:51:38.773]  Come over and get our rock-solid technology that wipes out debt without bankruptcy.
[02:51:38.793 --> 02:51:39.934]  1-2-3 Nodet.com.
[02:51:40.354 --> 02:51:41.315]  Live debt-free now.
[02:51:41.695 --> 02:51:43.277]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[02:51:45.535 --> 02:51:47.116]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:51:47.496 --> 02:51:53.240]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:51:53.500 --> 02:51:58.624]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:51:58.964 --> 02:52:08.250]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:52:08.590 --> 02:52:13.572]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:52:13.872 --> 02:52:17.894]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:52:18.094 --> 02:52:22.836]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:52:23.216 --> 02:52:29.118]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:52:29.438 --> 02:52:32.719]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:52:32.759 --> 02:52:36.560]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:52:56.291 --> 02:52:58.832]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:52:58.872 --> 02:53:01.633]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:53:02.013 --> 02:53:06.215]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:53:06.295 --> 02:53:13.217]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:53:13.337 --> 02:53:15.358]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:53:15.598 --> 02:53:26.063]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:53:26.343 --> 02:53:31.725]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:53:32.225 --> 02:53:34.847]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:53:34.867 --> 02:53:35.627]  You're called toll-free, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:35.647 --> 02:53:35.987]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:53:36.007 --> 02:53:37.288]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:53:48.057 --> 02:53:49.517]  Alright, program note.
[02:53:50.178 --> 02:53:52.719]  You know this show goes out on the AM and FM dials.
[02:53:52.759 --> 02:53:56.602]  Simulcast at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:53:58.103 --> 02:53:59.343]  Also on Global Shortwave.
[02:53:59.383 --> 02:54:02.845]  I'm no longer on WWFV or WWRB.
[02:54:02.886 --> 02:54:04.707]  We've switched to WWCR.
[02:54:05.827 --> 02:54:09.369]  The first two hours of the daytime show are carried on 9475, 9.475 Global Blowtorch.
[02:54:15.089 --> 02:54:17.192]  Uh, and 100,000 watts of shortwave.
[02:54:17.692 --> 02:54:22.699]  And at night, for this, for the next week, we're only going to be on the third hour of shortwave.
[02:54:23.320 --> 02:54:24.562]  And that's 3210 at night, 11 to midnight.
[02:54:26.900 --> 02:54:38.269]  In another week, we'll be on 10 to midnight at 3210, and then we're trying to get time for the first hour as well, or just tune in at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:38.349 --> 02:54:40.631]  We are in the market, for sure, for those other hours.
[02:54:41.432 --> 02:54:56.124]  Casey Nethercott, I'm told, by Ranch Rescue has gone in to do some last-minute legal stuff to stop from being arrested by the Patriot Act for some unannounced reason by the National Guard out there fighting the open borders, so that's
[02:54:57.327 --> 02:55:00.129]  We'll have more for you on that, obviously, tomorrow.
[02:55:01.250 --> 02:55:02.571]  Stacks of news we didn't get to.
[02:55:02.591 --> 02:55:03.812]  We did a pretty good job today, though.
[02:55:03.832 --> 02:55:05.093]  This is the New York Times.
[02:55:06.214 --> 02:55:08.957]  Senators' stocks beat the market by 12%.
[02:55:09.057 --> 02:55:12.299]  This is the New York Times.
[02:55:12.359 --> 02:55:13.901]  Now, I told you they have insider trading.
[02:55:13.921 --> 02:55:15.162]  That's part of the payoff.
[02:55:15.602 --> 02:55:17.163]  The stock market is totally controlled.
[02:55:17.243 --> 02:55:18.785]  It's a staged deal, folks.
[02:55:18.825 --> 02:55:19.385]  They run it.
[02:55:19.465 --> 02:55:20.546]  They control it.
[02:55:21.663 --> 02:55:21.823]  U.S.
[02:55:21.863 --> 02:55:29.270]  Senators' personal stock portfolios outperformed the market by an average of 12% a year in the five years to 1998.
[02:55:31.092 --> 02:55:38.198]  According to a new study, the results clearly support the notion that members of the Senate trade with a substantial informational advantage over ordinary investors.
[02:55:38.318 --> 02:55:46.746]  They don't pay income tax, most of them neither, says the author of the report, Professor Alan Zyborowski of the Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University.
[02:55:47.341 --> 02:55:56.609]  He admits to being very surprised by the findings, I'm not surprised, which were based on 6,000 financial disclosure filings and are due to be published in the Journal of Financial and Qualitative Analysis.
[02:55:57.190 --> 02:55:57.690]  Analysis?
[02:55:58.330 --> 02:55:59.211]  I mean, what do you mean?
[02:55:59.231 --> 02:56:04.436]  A bunch of members of Congress were cashing in on American and United days before.
[02:56:04.476 --> 02:56:06.758]  I mean, it's a private cash machine, folks.
[02:56:07.879 --> 02:56:12.463]  So, I mean, the Chicago Mercantile on the one-year anniversary of 9-11 came up 9-1-1.000.
[02:56:16.238 --> 02:56:18.219]  It never come up 9-1-1 plus 0-0-0-0.
[02:56:18.379 --> 02:56:22.100]  It was like 1 out of 14 trillion.
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:23.281]  Or was it billion?
[02:56:23.321 --> 02:56:23.741]  I forget.
[02:56:24.021 --> 02:56:25.242]  The Associated Press reported.
[02:56:25.262 --> 02:56:28.583]  It's like the New York Lottery coming up 9-11 on 9-11.
[02:56:28.803 --> 02:56:30.844]  They're flaunting it in your face!
[02:56:30.864 --> 02:56:33.765]  It's a big, sick joke to these people, okay?
[02:56:33.785 --> 02:56:37.026]  It's like a calling card to the psychopath leaves.
[02:56:37.487 --> 02:56:38.267]  Here's another one.
[02:56:38.923 --> 02:56:41.744]  Tag your rent defense pushes RFID to vendors.
[02:56:42.064 --> 02:56:50.947]  By January 05, 23,000 vendors selling goods to the Defense Department must begin to put radio frequency identification tags on the smallest practical unit of packaging.
[02:56:51.607 --> 02:56:57.929]  And again, last year DOD met with Ridge and the top Fortune 500 and said, it's a global tracking system.
[02:56:58.229 --> 02:57:00.310]  We want you to make the people accept it.
[02:57:00.670 --> 02:57:03.411]  And they said 78% are against it in internal polls.
[02:57:03.691 --> 02:57:04.351]  We don't care.
[02:57:04.371 --> 02:57:05.331]  They will submit.
[02:57:05.371 --> 02:57:06.292]  They're very passive.
[02:57:06.472 --> 02:57:07.232]  Just make them do it.
[02:57:07.858 --> 02:57:10.099]  So are you going to put up with that, folks, or are you going to get involved?
[02:57:10.219 --> 02:57:10.939]  Tracker chips.
[02:57:11.039 --> 02:57:12.280]  It's also in your money now.
[02:57:13.461 --> 02:57:22.265]  Before I end this powerful broadcast we had, I want to remind the listeners I've made ten films, I've written a book, I've published a book, I carry other books and videos by great authors.

[02:57:45.953 --> 02:57:47.454]  We need your support.
[02:57:54.240 --> 02:57:54.360]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:57:54.380 --> 02:58:02.022]  90% of those that see my videos are waking up.
[02:58:02.082 --> 02:58:03.622]  People are very perceptive right now.
[02:58:03.962 --> 02:58:05.102]  Very receptive right now.
[02:58:05.642 --> 02:58:08.343]  Write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.

[02:58:11.663 --> 02:58:12.183]  My book is $12.00.
[02:58:12.223 --> 02:58:12.704]  Watson's Books
[02:58:21.409 --> 02:58:25.875]  1995, Bloodlines Illuminati, 2595, 700 pages long.
[02:58:26.836 --> 02:58:29.500]  Just go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:31.623]  Alright, back tomorrow, back tonight.
[02:58:31.683 --> 02:58:32.584]  God bless you all.
[02:58:32.664 --> 02:58:33.105]  Take care.
[02:58:37.219 --> 02:58:41.723]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:58:42.063 --> 02:58:46.167]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
