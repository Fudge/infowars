[00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:05.946]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:07.668]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.368 --> 00:00:09.489]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:10.950]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.631]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:16.953]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:21.576]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:29.922]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:37.331]  I'm going to see The Passion today, and tomorrow I will have a review for you.
[00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:48.399]  I've already had a review from several people that have seen it, including Mel Gibson's father here on the show, but I'll actually get a chance to see it, and I'm really looking forward to it.
[00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:51.661]  I hope you all go out and watch it as well.
[00:00:53.563 --> 00:00:56.125]  Huge show lined up for you today.
[00:00:57.358 --> 00:01:20.721]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, Kevin Smith, who has done some stories for the website and done some camera work for us, he went out to the fourth New World Order, it's actually called New World Order Symposium on Terrorism, and I've been to two of those, he's been to all four,
[00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:28.645]  Viet Dinh, the Patriot Act supposed writer, and Justice Department minion has been there, and many others.
[00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:37.132]  This time they wouldn't let anybody have cameras last week, but the information and the interviews that Kevin did were very interesting.
[00:01:37.172 --> 00:01:41.135]  They had an Israeli Hamas double agent there.
[00:01:41.336 --> 00:01:43.738]  That's why they said everybody, no cameras allowed.
[00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:47.641]  And Kevin approached her, and we have her name and everything,
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.982]  They're not hiding her name, just her face, because she uses fake names when she's out in the field.
[00:01:54.942 --> 00:02:00.144]  This is very interesting information that's coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:15.409]  And Calvin came up to her and went over the mainstream evidence that's in the Jerusalem Post that Israel founded, with its money, Hamas, and controls Hamas, and is actually involved in some of the bombings.
[00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.590]  And she goes, yes, this is true.
[00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.230]  So, that was interesting.
[00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.331]  They had General Magus and others there.
[00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:31.072]  By the way, two weeks ago at the last symposium, they wouldn't let us film either, but would let some people film.
[00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:32.833]  This time, no one could film.
[00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.654]  So, we're going to spend about 15-20 minutes on that.
[00:02:37.274 --> 00:02:41.875]  Then we've got Colonel Don DeGraham coming on the show.
[00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.916]  He had a stroke over a year ago and hasn't done an interview since.
[00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:46.836]  I talked to the guy, sharp as ever.
[00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:49.100]  He's coming on the show.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:57.783]  He's the individual who put on the symposium in Portugal two years ago that made major headlines in that country.
[00:02:58.204 --> 00:02:59.604]  September 11th, U.S.
[00:02:59.644 --> 00:03:03.266]  government accused a group of military and civilian U.S.
[00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:10.369]  pilots under the chairmanship of Colonel Don DeGrande, after deliberating non-stop for 72 hours, has concluded
[00:03:11.607 --> 00:03:21.796]  That the flight crews of the four passenger airliners involved in the September 11th tragedy had no control over the aircraft, and they come down to the fact that only the globalists, only the U.S.
[00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:23.017]  government could carry this out.
[00:03:24.358 --> 00:03:34.146]  Of course, Andres von Bulow, the German technology minister, and before that, defense minister, said that publicly on this show at the best-selling book in Germany, laying out the facts of that.
[00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:39.383]  Michael Meacher, the number three guy in Blair's government, arguably number four.
[00:03:39.423 --> 00:03:51.049]  I don't want to get into a sub-debate about that, but a high-level member of Blair's government resigned last year and wrote an eight-page editorial for the London Guardian saying, if the government didn't do it, they certainly had prior knowledge and funded the terrorists.
[00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.611]  And he gave quotes out of the PENAC documents.
[00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:58.833]  So, Colonel Don DeGrande will be joining us.
[00:03:58.873 --> 00:03:59.874]  He's also an author.
[00:04:01.287 --> 00:04:03.908]  You're not going to want to miss this interview in the second hour.
[00:04:03.928 --> 00:04:07.769]  I really appreciate Don coming on the show.
[00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.010]  Highly decorated Korean War veteran.
[00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.310]  Shot twice in Korea.
[00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:15.131]  In OSS even before that.
[00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.192]  Right out of high school.
[00:04:17.932 --> 00:04:19.052]  During World War II.
[00:04:20.032 --> 00:04:21.293]  Right after World War II.
[00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.394]  And a long military career after that.
[00:04:24.554 --> 00:04:26.274]  And an expert on the New World Order.
[00:04:26.354 --> 00:04:27.535]  I've read a lot of his writings.
[00:04:27.575 --> 00:04:28.455]  I've never interviewed him.
[00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.913]  So that interview should be quite interesting in the second hour.
[00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:43.621]  Kevin Smith is joining us in about 25 minutes to talk about the Israeli slash Hamas agent.
[00:04:45.283 --> 00:04:46.284]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:46.384 --> 00:04:55.512]  Also a lot of new news on Skull & Bow, the situation in Haiti, reports, slavery alive and well in the U.S., CPS killing children.
[00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:56.532]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:56.552 --> 00:04:56.953]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.992 --> 00:05:08.477]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:08.897 --> 00:05:13.140]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:20.406]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:26.912]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:26.932 --> 00:05:28.253]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:28.593 --> 00:05:31.535]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:31.695 --> 00:05:33.717]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:41.262]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:41.562 --> 00:05:44.945]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:50.029]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[00:06:00.445 --> 00:06:03.727]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:07.971]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:10.993]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.193 --> 00:06:13.595]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:13.775 --> 00:06:22.421]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:22.621 --> 00:06:23.962]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:24.162 --> 00:06:28.285]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:28.645 --> 00:06:29.166]  We're good to go!
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.581]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:56.782]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:56.943 --> 00:06:57.543]  There is a chance.
[00:07:10.814 --> 00:07:13.436]  To use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:07:13.536 --> 00:07:16.297]  A New World Order can emerge.
[00:07:16.597 --> 00:07:20.800]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.804]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:27.944 --> 00:07:29.945]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:40.652]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:40.932 --> 00:07:46.296]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:50.598 --> 00:07:51.899]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:08:05.286 --> 00:08:05.926]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:07.647]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:09.467]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.127 --> 00:08:10.927]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.688 --> 00:08:12.608]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.268 --> 00:08:16.949]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:21.550]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.512 --> 00:08:26.952]  Monday through Friday,
[00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.071]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:31.132 --> 00:08:32.012]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:32.072 --> 00:08:51.983]  Central Standard Time I do this show and of course back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time the websites updated daily for you many times even on the weekend InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com I think the names of those websites say it all.
[00:08:52.023 --> 00:08:55.325]  We're fighting the prison planet transformation of Earth
[00:08:56.674 --> 00:09:00.578]  We are fighting it with the information war, with the truth.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:16.435]  Again, Colonel Don DeGrand, expert on 9-11, on the New World Order, put on the symposium in Portugal with top military officers and pilots, laying out how the globalists carried out September 11th,
[00:09:17.882 --> 00:09:26.309]  This will be his first interview since he had a stroke a little over a year ago, and I talked to him this morning, a very well-spoken, intelligent fellow, written some very interesting books.
[00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:40.059]  He'll be joining us, and again, we're going to get into a little symposium, the fourth part of it, called Terrorism, the New World Order, that they've had at UT, at the Presidential Library.
[00:09:41.096 --> 00:10:06.064]  We had one of our camera guys down there for the local TV shows, Kevin Smith, and he asked some serious questions, and there was a, quote, Mossad Hamas double agent, I already mentioned this but it's coming up, and that's how she was billed, and then he brought up to her, well, the major Israeli newspapers admit that Israel founded Hamas and carries out a lot of the bombings, and is that true?
[00:10:06.084 --> 00:10:07.425]  And she said, mm-hmm, yes, it's true.
[00:10:08.337 --> 00:10:11.159]  So, just calmly being announced, you know, out in the open.
[00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:35.174]  And by the way, it's like yesterday, and we posted it two days ago, I read the Newsday article out of New York City, where Bush's economic commission said that they want to consider all fast food restaurants, restaurants period is what they said, as manufacturing.
[00:10:35.654 --> 00:10:37.075]  Consider it a factory job,
[00:10:38.355 --> 00:10:44.218]  And consider it according to our output of machine goods, I guess.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:54.464]  And then they could say that we've actually gained 4 million factory jobs instead of losing 2 plus million since 2001.
[00:10:54.504 --> 00:10:55.645]  And that's what the article said.
[00:10:55.685 --> 00:10:59.507]  It's what Bush's cabinet-level office said.
[00:11:01.028 --> 00:11:07.833]  And I got emails saying, I'm a liar, they didn't say cheeseburgers are industry jobs.
[00:11:08.474 --> 00:11:12.316]  Okay, it's posted on the website, I know it's unbelievable, but it's really true.
[00:11:13.377 --> 00:11:21.823]  It's like Bush two weeks ago had the same commission say that our main export is now jobs, and that we should be very proud of this, and losing jobs is good.
[00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:28.008]  He actually said that, and Alan Greenspan over the weekend testified that it's good to export our jobs.
[00:11:29.794 --> 00:11:31.215]  And, you know, I mean, it's happening.
[00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:32.436]  I know this sounds insane.
[00:11:32.576 --> 00:11:33.317]  I can't believe it.
[00:11:33.677 --> 00:11:34.497]  But they're doing it.
[00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:36.178]  And I have Haratz.
[00:11:36.459 --> 00:11:38.040]  I have Jerusalem Post.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.561]  I have Yishak Rabin.
[00:11:40.641 --> 00:11:42.302]  I have United Press International.
[00:11:42.382 --> 00:11:44.764]  It's in Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:49.247]  It's in my video, Masters of Terror, and in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:11:49.647 --> 00:11:51.589]  There's a whole section on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:52.975 --> 00:12:02.239]  In the government-sponsored terrorist section, most of them are Jewish newspapers, calmly admitting that the Israelis in the early 70s founded Hamas, shut them up, funded them.
[00:12:02.659 --> 00:12:06.301]  The Hamas terrorists are always seen going into the military bases, coming back out.
[00:12:06.661 --> 00:12:07.621]  They get protected.
[00:12:08.642 --> 00:12:12.823]  And this is a Jewish newspaper, so if you've got a problem with it, just don't have a problem with them.
[00:12:13.584 --> 00:12:15.845]  Americans are just so naive about this.
[00:12:15.905 --> 00:12:19.226]  You go, why would Israel want to keep the terrorism going?
[00:12:20.545 --> 00:12:34.518]  Well, because then they get to get military funding, military control, the military-industrial complex, gets to have control over the Jewish population as well as the Palestinian population, and the war just gets to continue to roll forward.
[00:12:35.218 --> 00:12:37.380]  And the other Arab countries don't want it to end either.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.685]  It's a way to unify their nations and have some phony nationalism and blame Israel for everything.
[00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:45.968]  Governments want to have enemies.
[00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:47.369]  It's real simple.
[00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:51.356]  And then there are real terrorist attacks launched by Palestinians.
[00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:53.097]  There are real suicide bombers.
[00:12:53.177 --> 00:12:58.340]  But every time there's about to be a peace breakthrough or some process, that takes place.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.661]  You know, a bomb goes off.
[00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:09.826]  And in many cases, it is Palestinians publicly funded and controlled by Shembet or Mossad.
[00:13:11.367 --> 00:13:11.767]  Okay.
[00:13:14.802 --> 00:13:23.424]  By the way, Kevin was there openly talking to Mossad agents who were admitting this, and it was just basically a big joke there at the UT Presidential Library during this big symposium.
[00:13:24.264 --> 00:13:26.284]  Oh, but you know, we have to do this, they say.
[00:13:26.324 --> 00:13:27.904]  This is how we maintain control.
[00:13:27.924 --> 00:13:29.125]  It's like our government.
[00:13:29.145 --> 00:13:30.185]  You know, they blow stuff up.
[00:13:30.225 --> 00:13:30.885]  Hitler did it.
[00:13:30.945 --> 00:13:31.725]  The British do it.
[00:13:31.765 --> 00:13:32.665]  The Chinese do it.
[00:13:32.965 --> 00:13:36.726]  Putin's been doing it again right before his re-election.
[00:13:37.186 --> 00:13:42.527]  He just fired most of the government, and they're having a staged election, but you know, that's how you get control.
[00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:43.347]  You blow something up.
[00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.443]  So that's coming up, too, here on the show.
[00:13:47.663 --> 00:13:48.963]  Now, here's some of the news I've got.
[00:13:49.183 --> 00:13:51.044]  Skeleton key to the White House.
[00:13:51.124 --> 00:13:54.765]  London Guardian details the satanic leadership of the government.
[00:13:54.805 --> 00:13:55.805]  They actually get into that.
[00:13:56.045 --> 00:13:56.765]  We'll cover that.
[00:13:57.945 --> 00:13:59.166]  This is out of Newsday.
[00:13:59.346 --> 00:13:59.806]  Reports.
[00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:02.306]  Slavery alive and well in the U.S.
[00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:04.227]  Kidnapping women and children.
[00:14:04.267 --> 00:14:04.647]  You name it.
[00:14:05.362 --> 00:14:07.524]  Another big article here out of BBC.
[00:14:07.844 --> 00:14:09.625]  Probe child organ traffickers.
[00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:11.687]  When they kidnap the children, they take their organs.
[00:14:12.387 --> 00:14:14.649]  The major governments are involved in this, of course.
[00:14:14.869 --> 00:14:15.970]  Mainstream BBC.
[00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:18.332]  Let's just turn our guns into this government.
[00:14:18.352 --> 00:14:19.573]  They'll be much nicer to us.
[00:14:20.153 --> 00:14:20.594]  Let me see.
[00:14:20.614 --> 00:14:23.096]  Newsday reports slavery alive and well in the U.S.
[00:14:23.176 --> 00:14:26.198]  BBC probes child organ traffickers.
[00:14:26.318 --> 00:14:27.960]  Shows bags of babies' organs.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:28.620]  No big deal.
[00:14:29.721 --> 00:14:30.762]  Oh, and there's another one.
[00:14:30.782 --> 00:14:32.223]  This is out of Tallahassee.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.082]  Naples News, a human trafficking study looks towards remedies.
[00:14:37.102 --> 00:14:40.784]  A mother wants to know why child died in foster care.
[00:14:42.224 --> 00:14:52.930]  CPS workers decided a woman's child wasn't gaining weight fast enough and they had no evidence of abuse so they took the child and the child later, a few months later,
[00:14:54.076 --> 00:15:09.220]  uh... died in uh... in their custody and the mother asked you know why did you kill my child out there five times more likely to kill your children that's why they're the enforcers and uh... are uh... they're running things because of the most criminal the most likely to be a children so there we put over children
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:19.267]  They have the highest statistics of pedophiles and predators in the CPS line of work, in the line of work as truancy officers.
[00:15:20.468 --> 00:15:23.450]  By the way, you'd learn this at college if you took criminology.
[00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.192]  This is unadmitted fact, so I just thought we'd mention that to you.
[00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:30.675]  Because, you know, smart criminals know where to go to be predators.
[00:15:31.314 --> 00:15:32.896]  It's the stupid predators that get caught.
[00:15:32.916 --> 00:15:35.058]  The smart ones learn how to get badges and guns.
[00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:37.220]  I'm not saying all of them are like this.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.344]  I'm saying statistically, you find more of them there than anywhere else because they get protection.
[00:15:42.565 --> 00:15:44.767]  That's my point of unchecked power.
[00:15:45.407 --> 00:15:47.249]  I think the Founding Fathers told us about it.
[00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.154]  Also, they're murdering and mutilating whites in Africa, BBC.
[00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:56.538]  Earth almost put on impact alert.
[00:15:57.365 --> 00:16:02.767]  And BBC, also CNN, scientists want to be ready to block asteroids from hitting Earth.
[00:16:03.247 --> 00:16:17.090]  The mathematics show it on a collision course for Earth, but they say this every year or two, and that just means that according to their calculations, the plus or minus error is just a few hundred thousand miles, so it could hit the Earth.
[00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:25.473]  You know, because according to calculations, it could be a few hundred thousand miles, a few thousand miles, a few hundred thousand miles.
[00:16:25.653 --> 00:16:26.313]  They don't know.
[00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:30.470]  But it is true, giant asteroids do hit the Earth.
[00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:42.112]  I mean, I've stood in the craters in Mexico and Arizona in my travels, you know, that are twenty times bigger than, you know, ten times bigger than football fields, and those are small ones.
[00:16:43.652 --> 00:16:48.253]  A rock that size would, you know, kill half the people in your state if it hit.
[00:16:49.193 --> 00:16:50.513]  In fact, let's just cover that now.
[00:16:50.573 --> 00:16:54.214]  You can't bring something up like that and then not get into it, and then we'll get into the
[00:16:54.952 --> 00:16:57.313]  Well, how they grab your children and cut their guts out.
[00:16:57.613 --> 00:16:58.493]  You know, that's the government.
[00:16:59.174 --> 00:17:00.174]  Mainstream news, of course.
[00:17:00.994 --> 00:17:03.275]  Earth almost put on impact alert.
[00:17:04.436 --> 00:17:12.139]  Astronomers have revealed how they came within minutes of alerting the world to a potential asteroid strike last month.
[00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:20.922]  Some scientists believed on the 13th of January that a 30 meter object, that's big, later designated 2004 AS1,
[00:17:24.241 --> 00:17:27.686]  At a 1 in 4 chance of hitting the planet within 36 hours.
[00:17:27.706 --> 00:17:29.629]  1 in 4.
[00:17:29.729 --> 00:17:33.234]  Now they say there's a new one that could do that.
[00:17:33.254 --> 00:17:41.245]  It could have caused local devastation and said researchers contemplated a call to President Bush before new data finally showed there was no danger.
[00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:46.786]  The procedures for raising the alarm in such circumstances are now being revised.
[00:17:46.886 --> 00:17:54.713]  At the time, the President's team would have been putting the final touches on a speech he was due to make the following day at the headquarters of NASA, the U.S.
[00:17:54.753 --> 00:17:55.613]  Space Agency.
[00:17:56.094 --> 00:18:04.641]  In it, he planned to reset the course of manned space flight, sending it back to the Moon on the Mars, but he could have had something very different to say.
[00:18:05.922 --> 00:18:10.185]  He could have begun by warning the world it was about to be hit by a space rock.
[00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:12.651]  Now, let me just say this.
[00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:19.853]  Because of the meetings I've seen, I've interviewed Mrs. Shoemaker and others who are world experts on this here on the show.
[00:18:19.873 --> 00:18:25.775]  Due to the fear-mongering I've seen in the last ten years, the meetings with the Russians and the U.N.
[00:18:25.815 --> 00:18:29.836]  involvement, I'm saying an asteroid hitting the Earth is a real danger.
[00:18:30.336 --> 00:18:31.916]  Obviously, it happens quite often.
[00:18:33.036 --> 00:18:39.178]  Happened, you know, was it 1918 up in Siberia and it was like a nuclear bomb going off.
[00:18:40.345 --> 00:18:42.967]  Obviously this stuff happens, and it could be a big problem.
[00:18:44.067 --> 00:18:49.431]  And it probably will happen, you know, in our great-great-great-great-grandchildren's lifetimes.
[00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:57.656]  I mean, sometime in the next few hundred years, probably a big asteroid will hit and kill, you know, a few thousand people if it's rural, millions if it hits a big city.
[00:18:58.196 --> 00:18:59.877]  I mean, yes, we get hit by this stuff.
[00:19:00.817 --> 00:19:04.139]  Usually it hits rural areas, but the planet's been, you know, less populated.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.863]  But this is part of a larger, fear-mongering, global government move
[00:19:11.327 --> 00:19:25.659]  You know, proposing international space stations and the government could easily put something artificial in space, hit a city, claim it was an asteroid, use that crisis as a major restructuring tool for police state.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:32.746]  Because they've had all these movies, Steven Spielberg is a Bilderberg group member,
[00:19:33.804 --> 00:19:42.629]  And, uh, he goes to the Bilderberg Group and they ask him to make these asteroid movies and this is definitely part of their fear-mongering scenario.
[00:19:43.489 --> 00:19:44.870]  I don't know if they're gonna do it.
[00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:49.632]  I don't know exactly how it feeds in, but it's got New World Order all over it.
[00:19:49.832 --> 00:19:57.056]  Uh, just more on the asteroid and then just more on what they do with your kids after they kidnap them.
[00:19:57.816 --> 00:19:58.677]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.697 --> 00:19:59.157]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:01.799]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:01.879 --> 00:20:06.661]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:20:06.841 --> 00:20:14.644]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:20:14.904 --> 00:20:20.266]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:20:20.486 --> 00:20:27.468]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:20:27.748 --> 00:20:33.092]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:20:33.352 --> 00:20:38.095]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:20:38.435 --> 00:20:46.040]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:20:46.381 --> 00:20:51.844]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:20:52.925 --> 00:20:54.546]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:56.787 --> 00:20:57.348]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:57.388 --> 00:21:05.452]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:21:05.592 --> 00:21:13.657]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:21:13.937 --> 00:21:22.443]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[00:21:22.543 --> 00:21:28.447]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:21:28.627 --> 00:21:33.710]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:42.656]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:21:42.956 --> 00:21:50.021]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.983]  You hear a lot about the quality of the air outside these days.
[00:22:02.083 --> 00:22:02.584]  Pollution.
[00:22:02.624 --> 00:22:02.884]  Pollen.
[00:22:02.944 --> 00:22:04.046]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:22:04.126 --> 00:22:04.546]  Allergies.
[00:22:04.666 --> 00:22:04.947]  Asthma.
[00:22:04.987 --> 00:22:05.407]  Probably not.
[00:22:05.427 --> 00:22:06.449]  Well listen to this.
[00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:15.640]  Did you know according to the American Lung Association combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually 6 to 10 times worse than the air outside.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.561]  6 to 10 times.
[00:22:16.581 --> 00:22:17.082]  How could that be?
[00:22:28.032 --> 00:22:31.775]  I go into you, into your children, into their lungs.
[00:22:31.855 --> 00:22:32.655]  Am I scaring you?
[00:22:32.975 --> 00:22:33.876]  Remember this word?
[00:22:34.256 --> 00:22:34.997]  Puritech.
[00:22:35.037 --> 00:22:36.558]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[00:22:36.618 --> 00:22:38.799]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:51.528]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[00:22:51.608 --> 00:22:52.629]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[00:22:52.649 --> 00:22:52.689]  888-491-4100.
[00:22:52.709 --> 00:22:53.349]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[00:22:57.472 --> 00:22:58.777]  Online at PureTech.com
[00:22:59.983 --> 00:23:03.525]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:23:03.865 --> 00:23:04.185]  Yes.
[00:23:04.485 --> 00:23:06.846]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood.
[00:23:07.106 --> 00:23:09.267]  The richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[00:23:09.387 --> 00:23:18.311]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, 2 ounces of juice have the same nutrition as 3 pounds of choice garden produce.
[00:23:18.471 --> 00:23:26.194]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[00:23:26.414 --> 00:23:28.575]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[00:23:28.955 --> 00:23:35.999]  The 200 pages of our book, Wheatgrass, Nature's Finest Medicine, will remove any anxieties you may have about your nutritional supply.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.862]  In this kit, you will receive no monthly bills, no monthly pills.
[00:23:40.022 --> 00:23:41.663]  This is real self-sufficiency.
[00:23:41.743 --> 00:23:53.050]  To get more information about Wheatgrass, the book, seed, and the beautiful stainless steel wheatgrass juicer, go to austinwheatgrass.com or call toll-free 1-877-MY-WHEAT.
[00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.632]  And thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:07.222]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.922 --> 00:24:10.263]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:13.804 --> 00:24:17.365]  Earth almost put on impact alert.
[00:24:18.602 --> 00:24:26.227]  Imagine the unifying effect of a president or a world leader standing up and saying, we're going to be hit by this asteroid.
[00:24:26.267 --> 00:24:32.612]  We think it's going to plunge into Europe or the United States or Latin America or Africa.
[00:24:34.093 --> 00:24:35.694]  The circus that that would cause.
[00:24:36.474 --> 00:24:44.880]  And think of what a great diversion or political unifying effect it would be to detonate a nuclear weapon and then claim that it was an asteroid.
[00:24:46.738 --> 00:24:50.681]  Scientists want to be ready to block asteroid from hitting the Earth.
[00:24:51.281 --> 00:25:08.473]  The asteroid, believed to have wiped out dinosaurs 65 million years ago, was rare but hardly unique, say scientists gathered to discuss ways of aggressively defending our planet from another such space rock, including by detonating nukes in space.
[00:25:09.714 --> 00:25:15.958]  It's like the old James Bond movies, you know, where they shoot the nukes out to stop the
[00:25:16.753 --> 00:25:19.195]  Stop the asteroids coming in.
[00:25:19.915 --> 00:25:24.338]  And they claim there's more of these asteroids coming that are very close.
[00:25:25.038 --> 00:25:32.323]  Now we just have the radio telescopes and the telescopes and the different systems that are able to see these.
[00:25:32.803 --> 00:25:35.085]  We've always been hurtling through space.
[00:25:35.845 --> 00:25:45.832]  I mean, in between Mars and Jupiter, there's the gigantic asteroid belt, which they believe is the wreckage of a large planet.
[00:25:48.138 --> 00:25:48.999]  So, who knows?
[00:25:49.099 --> 00:25:55.103]  I mean, yeah, next week we could be hit by a, you know, ten mile across asteroid that would cause a new ice age.
[00:25:55.463 --> 00:25:59.826]  Or, it could be, uh, you know, five million years from now.
[00:26:00.046 --> 00:26:01.287]  You just don't know.
[00:26:02.268 --> 00:26:08.893]  But, uh, people that, you know, get on the radio and say, it's about to happen, you know, uh, buy my book.
[00:26:09.613 --> 00:26:14.296]  Only by buying my book can we, you know, make, change things.
[00:26:14.677 --> 00:26:15.958]  It's pretty interesting to, uh,
[00:26:17.276 --> 00:26:19.978]  To say the least, to hear people out there saying that and doing that.
[00:26:20.758 --> 00:26:32.284]  Speaking of bizarre, this is out of the London Guardian, and, you know, major paper of a major country just calmly announcing the satanic activities of the two presidential candidates.
[00:26:33.845 --> 00:26:41.930]  Skeleton key to White House, both John Kerry and George Bush were members of Yale's secretive Skull and Bones Society.
[00:26:43.937 --> 00:26:50.119]  Matthew Wells scours the university for future presidents and it goes on.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.521]  The hangman equals death, the devil equals death, death equals death.
[00:26:55.222 --> 00:27:01.184]  It's weird to think that the two men who are now contesting the most powerful job in the world
[00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:14.503]  Both apparently went through an occult ritual that involved dressing up and chanting the words above, prostrate, in front of a fellow student, wielding a butcher's knife, and dressed in animal skin.
[00:27:16.004 --> 00:27:28.830]  Uh, well, the video that was caught of the outside ritual is actually them in black hoods with someone dressed up like Satan, and then he offers them to come into hell and join him, and that's the rest of it, of course.
[00:27:29.452 --> 00:27:32.113]  John Kerry and George Bush Jr.
[00:27:32.193 --> 00:27:32.793]  and Sr.
[00:27:33.213 --> 00:27:36.194]  were members of the Secret of Skull and Bone Society at Yale University.
[00:27:36.814 --> 00:27:50.838]  The final words of the initiation ceremony, according to the intrepid New York Observer journalist Rob Rosenbaum, who has secretly recorded the secret of incantations, center around the command, Run, Neo, Fight!
[00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:56.540]  And then it's the next three pages get into the bizarre activities
[00:27:57.816 --> 00:28:05.400]  of skull and bones and how angry Bush gets if you bring it up to him and what the White House has to say about it.
[00:28:07.461 --> 00:28:11.783]  It is an admitted order of death founded by the Illuminati.
[00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:12.943]  That's MSNBC.
[00:28:13.163 --> 00:28:16.705]  Both are major presidential candidates, members of the U.S.
[00:28:16.765 --> 00:28:18.026]  branch of the Illuminati.
[00:28:19.766 --> 00:28:25.349]  And if you talk about it, the so-called Christian conservatives will rebuke you and say you're a lying devil.
[00:28:26.129 --> 00:28:29.030]  When confronted with it, they say, oh, they're just having fun.
[00:28:29.491 --> 00:28:31.551]  Now, this is not a fraternity, folks.
[00:28:32.412 --> 00:28:36.554]  You know, where you get drunk and roll around and act like idiots and say some Latin chants.
[00:28:37.654 --> 00:28:38.715]  Or Greek chants.
[00:28:39.255 --> 00:28:42.296]  And, you know, that comes as outer trappings.
[00:28:42.756 --> 00:28:46.238]  That is low-level minion cults trying to imitate the real thing.
[00:28:47.198 --> 00:28:49.899]  Skull and Bones is the real thing.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.401]  Then they work their evil in the real world.
[00:28:54.830 --> 00:29:00.212]  When we get back, we'll get into a quick report from the New World Order Symposium.
[00:29:00.592 --> 00:29:03.573]  That's what it was called, New World Order, Understanding Terrorism.
[00:29:04.373 --> 00:29:13.616]  The fourth part of it, where they had a Mossad-slash-Hamas double agent who admitted some interesting things to our reporter, Kevin Smith.
[00:29:14.356 --> 00:29:17.797]  Then report, Slavery Alive and Well in the U.S.
[00:29:17.837 --> 00:29:18.657]  That's Newsday.
[00:29:19.238 --> 00:29:23.759]  And BBC says, Probes Child Organ Trafficking.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:32.443]  The government says it is keen to track down and crack down on child traffickers who are believed to take children abroad and sell their organs for profit.
[00:29:33.943 --> 00:29:36.664]  And here's one out of the Naples News out of Florida.
[00:29:36.704 --> 00:29:39.005]  Human trafficking study looks towards remedies.
[00:29:40.526 --> 00:29:44.207]  And a lot of these kids are missing from child CPS in Florida.
[00:29:45.088 --> 00:29:46.408]  And that's Miami Herald.
[00:29:46.848 --> 00:29:48.589]  Kids go in, they never come out.
[00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.130]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.111]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:33:15.858 --> 00:33:21.664]  I, uh, published a book that's 320 plus pages long.
[00:33:22.725 --> 00:33:33.254]  It's got, uh, I don't know, 50 or 60 photos, diagrams, news articles, very easy to read, concise chapters, uh, condensed, just a whole education.
[00:33:33.835 --> 00:33:37.098]  Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[00:33:38.081 --> 00:33:46.927]  And one of the chapters, there's a chapter about British intelligence blowing stuff up to blame it on their enemies, Putin blowing stuff up to blame it on his enemies, U.S.
[00:33:46.967 --> 00:34:03.739]  government carrying out 9-11, three chapters on that, the history of it, and there's also a chapter on Israel, and really the chapter consists of UPI, Haratz, and Jerusalem Post admitting that basically Hamas is an arm of Shin Bet.
[00:34:04.813 --> 00:34:08.394]  If you've got a problem with it, have a problem with the Jerusalem Post and others.
[00:34:09.335 --> 00:34:14.716]  But that's all in Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[00:34:15.617 --> 00:34:17.477]  You need to have this book.

[00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:27.716]  It needs to be seen.

[00:36:13.203 --> 00:36:17.027]  But for the next 10 minutes or so, I want to talk to Kevin Smith, who I appreciate coming on the show.
[00:36:17.868 --> 00:36:19.249]  Kevin's gone to a lot of events.
[00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:27.538]  He's videotaped the Patriot Act behavior here in Austin when we threw that out, thanks to folks' action out there.
[00:36:28.439 --> 00:36:32.023]  And he's videotaped my confrontation with Vicente Fox.
[00:36:32.825 --> 00:36:33.886]  He's done a lot of good work.
[00:36:34.046 --> 00:36:43.010]  And Kevin has been to all four of the New World Order Understanding Terrorism Homeland Security Symposiums at the LBJ Library.
[00:36:44.591 --> 00:36:46.111]  I've been there twice.
[00:36:46.332 --> 00:36:47.432]  He's been to four of these.
[00:36:48.353 --> 00:36:50.914]  And now they're closed door.
[00:36:51.514 --> 00:36:53.255]  They're public, but you can't have cameras.
[00:36:53.735 --> 00:36:57.517]  And they said it's because, oh, we have a Mossad Hamas double agent.
[00:36:58.188 --> 00:36:59.068]  Good to be with you today, Alex.
[00:37:22.286 --> 00:37:47.957]  Just tell folks about the quote new world order terrorism symposium and I mean that's what they call the first one and through the fourth of the new world order understanding terrorism and what happened there what it was like and then this is this uh... this uh... Mossad slash uh... you know darker skinned lady so she could play the part of a Hamas character well it was it was basically a CIA and
[00:37:49.012 --> 00:37:51.493]  Massad Lovefest, from what I could tell.
[00:37:51.534 --> 00:37:55.496]  You know, it's a lot of credentials of the CFR and CIA.
[00:37:56.176 --> 00:38:02.179]  We had a man named Dennis Cliff there, who was the president of the Joint Military Intelligence College in Washington.
[00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:04.880]  There was also a Rhodes Scholar there.
[00:38:06.061 --> 00:38:09.943]  She ended up siding with me, which was unbelievable.
[00:38:09.983 --> 00:38:15.866]  It's a pretty high-level group of people, but when I went in there, this time I actually had to register.
[00:38:16.146 --> 00:38:17.747]  You had to register before you went in.
[00:38:18.653 --> 00:38:25.577]  And I went to set up the camera, and I had one of the General Meg's minions come over and tell me that I wouldn't be allowed to film.
[00:38:25.597 --> 00:38:28.959]  And I said, well, there goes the First Amendment, huh?
[00:38:28.979 --> 00:38:29.719]  It's out the window.
[00:38:29.739 --> 00:38:36.763]  And they said, well, we made an arrangement with this person because she's a double agent with Mossad, and we agreed not to film her face.
[00:38:36.823 --> 00:38:39.205]  And my point was, that's not an American agent.
[00:38:40.185 --> 00:38:41.826]  What loyalty do I have to that person?
[00:38:41.866 --> 00:38:45.008]  But I agreed, and her lecture was
[00:38:45.598 --> 00:38:47.238]  Basically, the psychology of a suicide.
[00:38:47.278 --> 00:38:53.500]  By the way, since they built this thing in the 70s, you know, big presidential library, you can videotape everything.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.001]  So, you know, they just started doing this because we've been taking these things over.
[00:38:59.882 --> 00:39:05.103]  Yeah, well, I went down to her and, you know, I'll have to plug your book, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:39:05.163 --> 00:39:13.365]  All I did was go back to that and the way that book is arranged, it's hyperlinked at the bottom to the quotes in the index.
[00:39:13.966 --> 00:39:15.366]  I just printed those articles up.
[00:39:15.996 --> 00:39:18.378]  Walked straight over to her and I said, you know, I have to agree.
[00:39:18.818 --> 00:39:21.360]  There are a lot of similarities between Al-Qaeda and Hamas.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.561]  They're both created by our intelligence agencies.
[00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:25.242]  And she said, no, what?
[00:39:25.262 --> 00:39:36.009]  And I said, well, here's this article that says that Rabin acknowledged it right before you killed him, before Shin Bet killed him, that that was the case, that Shamir had started it.
[00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:37.991]  And she said, yes, that's true.
[00:39:38.451 --> 00:39:38.971]  That is true.
[00:39:39.031 --> 00:39:39.712]  We do operate
[00:39:40.268 --> 00:39:40.568]  I'm off.
[00:39:40.928 --> 00:39:43.949]  Now, tell us her name, because that part was public.
[00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:45.970]  Her name is Yael Shahar.
[00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:49.851]  Yael Shahar, and she looks like an Arab.
[00:39:50.091 --> 00:39:51.972]  She's a little dark, she's a little dark-complexed.
[00:39:51.992 --> 00:39:59.014]  She's an attractive woman, but she's the director of database program for International Policy Institute of Counterterrorism.
[00:39:59.034 --> 00:40:04.736]  Yeah, the point is, is I wasn't going into her skin color, I was pointing out that she's, you know, an infiltrator into all this.
[00:40:05.217 --> 00:40:09.158]  She well, well easily could do that, and matter of fact, she had acknowledged that she had
[00:40:09.713 --> 00:40:12.135]  She had foiled some suicide bombing attacks.
[00:40:12.215 --> 00:40:14.816]  But, you know, I think that's the deal.
[00:40:15.077 --> 00:40:24.043]  When confronted, when the documents put in front of them, acknowledge it and then... Now, you talked about a well-known professor running over to you and talking about how the government was behind the chair.
[00:40:24.863 --> 00:40:35.110]  Well, he had brought up to them, his name's Galbraith, and he had come in and said, when are you guys going to quit talking about Israel and Syria and whoever else is next on the list and bring up
[00:40:35.632 --> 00:40:40.213]  The fact that your boys, the ISI in Pakistan, are the ones that are proliferating all these nuclear weapons.
[00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:43.874]  And he was really discouraged by what he was hearing.
[00:40:43.894 --> 00:40:52.037]  I believe he, on paper, probably believed and went along with what they were trying to do, but now that he's seeing it implemented, it's not the way he wanted.
[00:40:52.137 --> 00:40:59.999]  But he told me they're getting desperate, that the thing's blowing up in their face, and this is part of damage control for them, I suppose.
[00:41:01.403 --> 00:41:05.025]  And there was even this Rhodes Scholar person there who was agreeing with you.
[00:41:05.505 --> 00:41:26.196]  Well, if people get your video, Matrix of Evil, they'll get to see our Justice Department minion here in Austin, Ron Sievert, and he had gone on in his little five-minute lecture before the panel discussion and questions and answers, and he said, well, people are concerned about the sneaking pig, people are concerned about warrantless searches and
[00:41:27.941 --> 00:41:30.462]  Whether or not there's any attorney-client privilege any longer.
[00:41:30.482 --> 00:41:32.102]  He said, well, that's just all not true.
[00:41:32.142 --> 00:41:33.482]  We still have to get warrants.
[00:41:33.542 --> 00:41:35.543]  And that's a lie.
[00:41:35.583 --> 00:41:36.463]  Of course it's a lie.
[00:41:36.963 --> 00:41:38.863]  And I can front him in the film and call him a liar.
[00:41:39.123 --> 00:41:41.004]  No, I got to go after him this time.
[00:41:41.064 --> 00:41:47.585]  And he said, well, so with the attorney-client privilege, it's really not a violation because we're notifying them ahead of time.
[00:41:48.245 --> 00:41:49.386]  So there's no violation.
[00:41:49.426 --> 00:41:55.247]  And my analogy was, sir, I'm telling you in two minutes from now, I'm going to stand up and go and punch you in the face.
[00:41:56.152 --> 00:42:01.228]  And having pre-warned you of that, you know, two minutes from now if I do it, does that not still make it assault?
[00:42:01.308 --> 00:42:02.653]  My answer was, of course it's assault.
[00:42:03.095 --> 00:42:12.144]  It's the same argument he's using, but during that exchange... Yeah, he's saying that, oh, we have to tell you that you don't have any attorney-client privilege, so that makes it okay.
[00:42:12.584 --> 00:42:14.446]  And then, oh, we have to have warrants.
[00:42:14.506 --> 00:42:18.750]  Well, they admit that the bill says, no longer need a warrant.
[00:42:20.832 --> 00:42:23.795]  And now, you then brought up Section 802 to him.
[00:42:24.296 --> 00:42:26.258]  Oh, you've seen him in operation.
[00:42:26.278 --> 00:42:27.399]  They'll deny every bit of it.
[00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:35.573]  And that's when friction started between another one of the panel members, Sarah Cleveland, who's a Rhodes Scholar and law professor.
[00:42:36.274 --> 00:42:41.476]  She'd had enough of this guy deciding when someone would be an American citizen and when they wouldn't be.
[00:42:42.356 --> 00:42:47.338]  There was quite a bit of contention between them two.
[00:42:47.378 --> 00:42:53.801]  The man that had shoved me two meetings ago, he ends up not just being some low-level minion.
[00:42:54.481 --> 00:42:55.642]  His name is Scott Bates.
[00:42:56.365 --> 00:42:59.926]  He's a Senior Policy Advisor for House Select Committee on Homeland Security.
[00:43:00.826 --> 00:43:05.587]  He was in Kosovo as the Director of the National Democratic Institute in Pristina.
[00:43:05.607 --> 00:43:14.508]  And in June of 2002, he went to Afghanistan and worked with Loya Jirga to support their efforts to create a transitional government.
[00:43:14.808 --> 00:43:19.689]  And it turns out, wasn't he like the youngest?
[00:43:20.029 --> 00:43:22.510]  At 26, he became Secretary of State of Virginia.
[00:43:23.243 --> 00:43:26.615]  He didn't really strike me as being that much of a whiz kid, so I don't know.
[00:43:26.695 --> 00:43:28.240]  And by the way, this is the guy...
[00:43:29.139 --> 00:43:35.661]  Who, when you're there trying to film, while there are other cameras filming, he runs over and starts bumping into you, pushing you, saying, you can't film.
[00:43:36.002 --> 00:43:53.148]  And I heard what you said, and you were remembering just vicious, viciousness, but... So, I mean, that's how few of these people there are, is that we go to these New World Order meetings, it's called New World Order, and we have, you know, former Secretary of States and, you know, CFR members running security.
[00:43:53.228 --> 00:43:54.408]  I mean, they're pathetic.
[00:43:54.708 --> 00:43:55.969]  Yeah, they're not very scary.
[00:43:57.202 --> 00:44:13.808]  But hey Alex, I wanted to get a plug in for something that's going on tonight I just became aware of at Trinity University in San Antonio and I'll give their website out it's www.trinity.edu and the contact number is 210-999-8406.
[00:44:13.928 --> 00:44:19.790]  Okay, but tell folks what it is first.
[00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.951]  Here we go, tonight David Kaye is speaking
[00:44:23.533 --> 00:44:27.914]  The Distinguished Lecture Series for Spring of 2004 at Trinity University.
[00:44:27.994 --> 00:44:33.216]  And David Kaye's the inspector that said, yes, they have weapons of mass destruction, now he says they lied.
[00:44:33.596 --> 00:44:44.719]  Well, he'll be speaking at the Lorry Auditorium tonight at 730 in San Antonio, so if anybody's in the area, and this is not someone to be, you know, jumped and ganged up on.
[00:44:44.759 --> 00:44:46.259]  I think this is a guy that's willing to
[00:44:46.857 --> 00:44:49.359]  I can tell quite a bit if I ask the right questions.
[00:44:49.799 --> 00:44:53.902]  Okay, and so that's in San Antonio tonight at Trinity University.
[00:44:54.142 --> 00:45:06.810]  Kevin, going back to this Mossad-slash-Hamas agent, you brought up to her the printed off UPI and Heratz and Jerusalem Post articles, and you say you handed out like 50 of these.
[00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:11.173]  What was their response to all these mainstream news articles?
[00:45:12.147 --> 00:45:20.569]  Her response, out of the eye of everyone in the auditorium with just three or four people standing there, was just to plainly acknowledge it and then move on.
[00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:28.151]  I put them out and quite a few people came up and grabbed the documents and sat back and read them.
[00:45:28.272 --> 00:45:30.012]  Then they came up to us after it was over.
[00:45:30.072 --> 00:45:32.173]  We went to lunch with some of them.
[00:45:33.593 --> 00:45:34.333]  It's all there.
[00:45:34.393 --> 00:45:36.954]  I really have to plug that great book, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:45:36.974 --> 00:45:40.675]  It was so easy for me to take those documents straight off the internet.
[00:45:41.636 --> 00:45:48.465]  You know the woman is very pleasant and I don't have any personal grudge against this person.
[00:45:48.605 --> 00:45:53.752]  She was pretty straight forward with me about it and it did not match her lecture.
[00:45:55.314 --> 00:45:59.039]  To hear her tell it, every Muslim has fangs and eats babies.
[00:46:00.959 --> 00:46:01.279]  I don't know.
[00:46:01.299 --> 00:46:03.260]  Alright, well Kevin, good to have you on the show.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.300]  I appreciate you going and checking that out for us.
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:12.203]  I wish I felt a little better, but I've got whatever you had last week, probably, or whatever they sprayed us with, and my throat's pretty tore up.
[00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:13.863]  Alright, well thanks for what you did.
[00:46:13.883 --> 00:46:14.603]  I appreciate it.
[00:46:14.663 --> 00:46:15.444]  No problem.
[00:46:15.484 --> 00:46:17.704]  I'll try to get down there the next time, too.
[00:46:18.105 --> 00:46:18.865]  Alright, great.
[00:46:19.985 --> 00:46:21.966]  It's so important to confront these people.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.682]  And to let them know that we're aware of their activities.
[00:46:25.323 --> 00:46:26.945]  Let's talk to Jan in Colorado.
[00:46:26.985 --> 00:46:28.686]  Jan, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:46:29.127 --> 00:46:29.908]  Yes, thank you.
[00:46:29.928 --> 00:46:31.649]  I appreciate your work.
[00:46:31.669 --> 00:46:32.951]  You're sure doing a nice job.
[00:46:33.671 --> 00:46:41.119]  Alex, I saw your video, Bohemian Grove, and I had one question and I can't find the information on it, and maybe you could help me?
[00:46:41.479 --> 00:46:41.720]  Sure.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.742]  What is the cremation of care?
[00:46:43.802 --> 00:46:45.944]  What are the roots of that?
[00:46:46.437 --> 00:46:48.439]  Is it a real sacrifice?
[00:46:48.519 --> 00:46:48.859]  Yes.
[00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:51.161]  Well, I mean, it's a real ritual.
[00:46:51.201 --> 00:46:53.363]  I don't know that they're actually killing a baby, but...
[00:46:56.016 --> 00:47:03.762]  Okay, they address it as the Great Owl of Bohemia, they address it in the female, and they address it in the male connotation.
[00:47:04.843 --> 00:47:20.354]  For those that just joined us, Bohemian Grove, since 1872, is an elite encampment in Northern California, in a 2,700 acre redwood grove, with a giant stone owl, and it doubles as a bull.
[00:47:20.454 --> 00:47:25.098]  Again, all these Babylonian gods had two sides, or two manifestations.
[00:47:26.025 --> 00:47:29.767]  And they would take a child before it and burn it.
[00:47:30.907 --> 00:47:38.931]  And the Canaanites would come down and grab Israeli children and haul them back up and sacrifice to the God.
[00:47:39.011 --> 00:47:43.272]  And your dictionary has the definition of Moloch in it, the human sacrifice to God.
[00:47:44.553 --> 00:47:50.796]  The cremation of Ker is the height of black magic, the height of Babylon mystery religion.
[00:47:51.316 --> 00:47:53.977]  It is the do as thou wilt, don't have a conscience,
[00:47:55.057 --> 00:47:59.440]  Shed your responsibilities when you have to go into the marketplace.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.662]  It is a ritual to have no conscience.
[00:48:02.682 --> 00:48:03.723]  They actually say that.
[00:48:04.103 --> 00:48:05.184]  And to not care.
[00:48:05.204 --> 00:48:07.345]  And to cremate care.
[00:48:07.665 --> 00:48:12.368]  And they do that by destroying innocence or this child.
[00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:18.192]  And then that's of course what Satanists do in their more druidic or modern expression of Satanism.
[00:48:18.492 --> 00:48:21.474]  You know, kidnapping a baby, cutting its heart out for power.
[00:48:22.214 --> 00:48:23.955]  And it's, you know, to give them power.
[00:48:23.995 --> 00:48:25.496]  Well, that's what they do with the groves.
[00:48:25.536 --> 00:48:28.838]  They have this small bound body, which they say is an effigy.
[00:48:28.878 --> 00:48:29.699]  They make that clear.
[00:48:30.199 --> 00:48:31.180]  They set it on fire.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.280]  It screams in pain.
[00:48:32.881 --> 00:48:38.304]  And this is how they, for another year, protect themselves from conscience.
[00:48:40.846 --> 00:48:42.667]  But you don't think it's a real baby?
[00:48:43.872 --> 00:48:53.558]  I was over 100 yards away, and again, it's aired on national television on the Trio Network, the footage I shot, and it's aired on British television.
[00:48:54.579 --> 00:49:01.584]  It's up to folks to make their own decision, but I tend to believe it wasn't a baby.
[00:49:02.624 --> 00:49:03.705]  I just want to believe that.
[00:49:04.937 --> 00:49:28.014]  But, you know, they're sacrificing in the real world with depleted uranium and cluster bombs and fluoride and vaccines and Ritalin and Prozac and so this is a ritual symbolizing that they don't care and for another year the ritual protects them from what they call bad karma or conscience.
[00:49:28.414 --> 00:49:31.637]  This is a ritual to protect them from their activities.
[00:49:33.063 --> 00:49:35.204]  Again, the devil always engages in a counterfeit.
[00:49:35.264 --> 00:49:40.305]  It's kind of like they're covering themselves in the blood for another year to protect themselves.
[00:49:40.605 --> 00:49:43.666]  You know, like Christians cover themselves in the blood of Christ.
[00:49:43.966 --> 00:49:44.206]  Right.
[00:49:46.146 --> 00:49:47.967]  And I'm going to see The Passion today, by the way.
[00:49:47.987 --> 00:49:49.807]  Okay, well, I appreciate that.
[00:49:49.827 --> 00:49:50.207]  Thank you.
[00:49:50.507 --> 00:49:51.248]  Okay, thank you.
[00:49:51.568 --> 00:49:53.068]  I'm glad I can answer your question.
[00:49:53.088 --> 00:49:54.028]  Yes, I'm very excited.
[00:49:57.629 --> 00:49:58.689]  Let's talk to Paul.
[00:49:58.969 --> 00:50:00.650]  Let's talk to Paul in New York.
[00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:01.370]  Go ahead, Paul.
[00:50:04.062 --> 00:50:05.222]  Paul, you're on the air, buddy.
[00:50:07.803 --> 00:50:08.643]  Or maybe not.
[00:50:08.823 --> 00:50:09.724]  Maybe you're not there.
[00:50:09.744 --> 00:50:11.944]  Uh-oh.
[00:50:13.045 --> 00:50:13.485]  You know what?
[00:50:13.505 --> 00:50:16.146]  We'll go to Christopher in Ottawa, Canada after the break.
[00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:17.486]  We're too close to break here.
[00:50:17.546 --> 00:50:18.967]  We'll come back and go to more calls.
[00:50:19.027 --> 00:50:20.487]  And then, reports!
[00:50:20.627 --> 00:50:22.908]  Slavery alive and well in the U.S.
[00:50:24.368 --> 00:50:26.729]  BBC probes child organ traffickers.
[00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:30.610]  This is Naples News.
[00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:32.991]  Human trafficking study looks towards remedies.
[00:50:33.729 --> 00:50:35.150]  The government, of course, is doing it.
[00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.990]  We'll save you from it.
[00:50:36.571 --> 00:50:39.092]  Mother wants to know why a child died in foster care.
[00:50:40.333 --> 00:50:42.014]  You read this article out of Missouri.
[00:50:42.354 --> 00:50:44.335]  They took the child for no reason and killed it.
[00:50:45.816 --> 00:50:47.977]  Well, statistically, they're the most dangerous people, yeah.
[00:50:50.039 --> 00:50:52.040]  So, uh, we'll come back with all this, too.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.501]  We gotta expose the evil if we're gonna be able to stop it.
[00:50:54.521 --> 00:50:56.582]  Everybody stay with us.
[00:50:56.622 --> 00:50:58.984]  We got Colonel Don DeGraham coming on, too.
[00:51:02.369 --> 00:51:06.851]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:51:07.211 --> 00:51:11.292]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:51:11.592 --> 00:51:12.132]  We listened.
[00:51:12.452 --> 00:51:17.434]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:51:17.694 --> 00:51:18.194]  We listened.
[00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:21.616]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:51:22.036 --> 00:51:22.556]  We listened.
[00:51:23.036 --> 00:51:27.100]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:27.961]  We listened.
[00:51:28.301 --> 00:51:33.546]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:51:33.967 --> 00:51:35.328]  Again, we listened.
[00:51:35.688 --> 00:51:43.075]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:51:43.456 --> 00:51:46.498]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259.99.
[00:51:54.667 --> 00:52:07.496]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:52:07.816 --> 00:52:09.197]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:52:09.397 --> 00:52:11.598]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:52:11.758 --> 00:52:13.840]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:18.963]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:52:23.666 --> 00:52:25.427]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:52:25.507 --> 00:52:36.171]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[00:52:36.311 --> 00:52:38.212]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:52:38.412 --> 00:52:42.274]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[00:52:42.374 --> 00:52:43.794]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:52:43.834 --> 00:52:44.034]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:50.737 --> 00:52:54.443]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:52:54.744 --> 00:52:55.445]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:53:00.976 --> 00:53:01.376]  Brrr!
[00:53:01.556 --> 00:53:03.578]  Record cold spells gripping the nation this winter.
[00:53:03.698 --> 00:53:04.799]  So much for global warming.
[00:53:04.999 --> 00:53:09.102]  Of course, hand-in-hand with record cold spells usually go record fuel bills for heating.
[00:53:09.222 --> 00:53:12.164]  But for thousands of people across the country, there's no record fuel bill.
[00:53:12.344 --> 00:53:13.605]  In fact, there's no bill at all.
[00:53:13.765 --> 00:53:20.249]  These people have discovered the magic of a warm workshop without the cost by burning waste oil with a waste oil heater kit from Harold Electric.
[00:53:20.449 --> 00:53:23.071]  We all enjoy having a comfortable shop in the winter months to work in.
[00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:30.036]  And a waste oil heater from Harold Electric can turn your waste oil from a liability into an incredibly efficient and economical way to heat your workshop.
[00:53:30.256 --> 00:53:31.657]  The Waste Oil Heater burns clean.
[00:53:31.857 --> 00:53:35.099]  So clean, in fact, that there's absolutely no visible smoke while it's running.
[00:53:35.199 --> 00:53:36.300]  There's no expensive maintenance.
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.241]  And the Waste Oil Heaters from Harold Electric are easy to operate.
[00:53:39.401 --> 00:53:44.424]  With heating costs skyrocketing in the past couple of years, adding a Waste Oil Heater in your shop makes perfect sense.
[00:53:44.644 --> 00:53:47.846]  And with a Waste Oil Heater kit you build yourself from Harold Electric, it's easy.
[00:53:47.966 --> 00:53:50.448]  To learn more, visit wasteoilheater.net.
[00:53:50.588 --> 00:53:53.850]  That's www.wasteoilheater.net or call 1-800-541-8910.
[00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:55.691]  Call Harold Electric today and work in comfort tomorrow.
[00:54:03.817 --> 00:54:09.859]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.459 --> 00:54:13.480]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.081 --> 00:54:18.242]  Alright, my friends, we're back live.
[00:54:18.262 --> 00:54:29.285]  You know, I feel so good about the passion fighting back against the New World Order, fighting back against all the bilge and propaganda and degeneracy they're pumping out.
[00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:38.917]  With good people like Mel Gibson with Braveheart and The Patriot and even Conspiracy Theory woke up a lot of people and now The Passion.
[00:54:39.958 --> 00:54:46.423]  You know, there are good people and we should support those that put out alternative information from the beast system.
[00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:50.967]  Let's go ahead and talk to Christopher in Canada.
[00:54:51.407 --> 00:54:53.369]  Christopher, welcome to the Airwaves!
[00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:54.570]  Thank you, hi Alex.
[00:54:55.151 --> 00:54:55.411]  Hello.
[00:54:55.652 --> 00:54:57.774]  We're talking about the First Amendment.
[00:54:57.794 --> 00:55:01.938]  Your guest was mentioning the First Amendment and the Matrix of Evil.
[00:55:02.038 --> 00:55:05.121]  I ordered your films and I ordered two books.
[00:55:06.462 --> 00:55:07.904]  They were shipped out December 17th.
[00:55:08.024 --> 00:55:11.848]  They never came to Canada, to the Nazi Northern Canada.
[00:55:13.075 --> 00:55:15.277]  Yeah, we'll just keep sending it out to you.
[00:55:15.998 --> 00:55:27.709]  And I'm sorry, you hear all the posts... No, I would like to suggest that you have given option to the International Canadian Shipping to ship registered mail or UPS, something with a signature, you know?
[00:55:28.089 --> 00:55:36.457]  Yeah, they haven't been as bad lately, but I've actually, two years ago, I got a letter from Canada from Customs saying this is contraband.
[00:55:38.018 --> 00:55:43.002]  And sometimes that happens from England, but yep, just call my office, we'll ship it out to you.
[00:55:43.542 --> 00:55:44.904]  Nazi state.
[00:55:44.984 --> 00:55:45.704]  Registered mail.
[00:55:45.764 --> 00:55:47.626]  Yeah, Canada is the worst.
[00:55:47.806 --> 00:55:48.867]  England, no problem.
[00:55:49.307 --> 00:55:50.548]  Germany, no problem.
[00:55:50.648 --> 00:55:51.969]  Australia, no problem.
[00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:57.254]  They open a lot of stuff, and a lot of people have had a problem with Canada.
[00:55:57.494 --> 00:55:58.374]  I'll have to get the number.
[00:55:58.775 --> 00:55:59.816]  The next thing is, the B.C.
[00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:03.919]  government, yesterday on the news here, announced that they're selling off
[00:56:04.605 --> 00:56:09.649]  The management of their medical database to a US company.
[00:56:09.889 --> 00:56:27.062]  The people who are opposed to this were citing on the news yesterday how the Patriot Act in the United States could be used to access all BC Canadian citizens from British Columbia medical records and put into this database.
[00:56:27.262 --> 00:56:28.683]  Let me give you an example of this.
[00:56:28.743 --> 00:56:31.065]  My friend makes comedy videos.
[00:56:32.463 --> 00:56:34.926]  You know, mainstream stuff that's aired on HBO.
[00:56:35.807 --> 00:56:39.891]  And he was going to FedEx some to a film critic in England.
[00:56:40.752 --> 00:56:46.798]  And when FedEx came to his house, they said, well, because of the Patriot Act, we've got to know everything that's on these videos.
[00:56:46.818 --> 00:56:50.983]  He had to fill out four pages of forms per video.
[00:56:51.083 --> 00:56:54.066]  They can buy their own and watch them if they want to know what's on them.
[00:56:54.676 --> 00:56:57.917]  Well, I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[00:56:58.057 --> 00:57:03.639]  In America, FedEx makes you fill out what the video's about.
[00:57:03.759 --> 00:57:06.619]  Oh, FedEx now is a government agent, oh no.
[00:57:06.699 --> 00:57:09.080]  Well, what they do is they collect data, yeah.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.061]  And it's all fast approaching.
[00:57:12.081 --> 00:57:21.043]  I'd like to remind all Americans and Canadians to stand up and be in their face, to let them know that we know and they're going to answer to this.
[00:57:23.666 --> 00:57:26.327]  I'm going to get prosecuted one day for doing all this, okay?
[00:57:26.347 --> 00:57:27.727]  They will.
[00:57:28.387 --> 00:57:34.349]  I tried to explain to my colleagues at work, I work for Nordstrom Networks, it's like a big Cisco.
[00:57:34.629 --> 00:57:34.909]  Yes.
[00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:36.270]  In Canada, huge, huge.
[00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:37.110]  Okay?
[00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:51.174]  And I tried to explain to them the importance of the Second Amendment and why it was put in there, into the United States Constitution, so you know, I tried to make them aware that these people are just communists.
[00:57:55.602 --> 00:58:11.536]  I think you have a right to defend yourself before you have a right or an obligation to take care of someone else's health, unless your own family.
[00:58:13.397 --> 00:58:17.161]  Absolutely, and the areas that have guns have lower crime rates.
[00:58:17.321 --> 00:58:19.843]  Then once they start reading the American
[00:58:20.379 --> 00:58:28.383]  Declaration of Independence and why the Second Amendment was put in there to protect the citizens against their own government.
[00:58:28.763 --> 00:58:29.983]  Absolutely, Christopher.
[00:58:30.003 --> 00:58:31.104]  They wake up, you know.
[00:58:31.124 --> 00:58:36.526]  Christopher, we got to break and start the second hour, but let me talk to you during the break and give you my office phone number.
[00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:37.107]  Yeah, that'd be nice.
[00:58:37.307 --> 00:58:39.588]  And I'm going to get that out to you registered mail.
[00:58:39.608 --> 00:58:40.948]  In fact, we're supposed to do that.
[00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:45.951]  There's probably a record of it with your horrible customs department.
[00:58:46.651 --> 00:58:47.811]  So stay there, my friend.
[00:58:48.131 --> 00:58:49.152]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:51.081 --> 00:58:54.543]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:58:54.823 --> 00:58:58.324]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:58:58.404 --> 00:59:02.346]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:59:02.566 --> 00:59:08.729]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:09.149 --> 00:59:17.053]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:22.817]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:59:22.977 --> 00:59:26.739]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:27.099 --> 00:59:28.961]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[00:59:29.021 --> 00:59:31.182]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:59:31.442 --> 00:59:36.365]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:59:36.405 --> 00:59:41.969]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:59:45.351 --> 00:59:49.196]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:59:57.145 --> 00:59:57.825]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.446 --> 00:59:59.527]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.228 --> 01:00:01.389]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:01.409 --> 01:00:02.831]  You want answers?
[01:00:03.552 --> 01:00:04.333]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:08.744]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.284 --> 01:00:13.406]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.826 --> 01:00:25.090]  We are now entering the second hour of this global transmission against tyranny.
[01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.550]  It is Wednesday, the 25th day
[01:00:29.934 --> 01:00:31.196]  of February 2004.
[01:00:31.316 --> 01:00:35.959]  The Passion came out today, by the way.
[01:00:35.979 --> 01:00:42.685]  I'll be watching it this evening, and I'll give you a report on it tomorrow in the first hour of the show.
[01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.608]  Coming up in this hour, reports.
[01:00:45.728 --> 01:00:47.529]  Slavery alive and well in the U.S.
[01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:48.950]  That's Newsday.
[01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:50.251]  BBC.
[01:00:50.371 --> 01:00:51.052]  Probes.
[01:00:52.033 --> 01:00:53.754]  Child organ traffickers.
[01:00:53.814 --> 01:00:55.636]  They grabbed the children and cut their guts out.
[01:00:56.986 --> 01:01:00.007]  Human Trafficking Study looks towards remedies out of Florida.
[01:01:01.168 --> 01:01:02.848]  And much, much more.
[01:01:02.988 --> 01:01:10.591]  We will get into Homeland Security, the police state, what's happening, and of course, your phone calls.
[01:01:12.132 --> 01:01:16.433]  For those that are patiently holding, the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:16.453 --> 01:01:17.834]  Colonel Don DeGrand is an author.
[01:01:17.894 --> 01:01:19.114]  He's a military veteran.
[01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:36.510]  He put on a symposium a few years ago that made headlines in major newspapers in Portugal.
[01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:38.512]  We have one of those articles posted.
[01:01:39.421 --> 01:01:48.988]  And it says a Portugal-based investigative journalist has presented the news with a version of the September 11th attacks that has to date failed to attract the attention of the international press.
[01:01:49.468 --> 01:01:59.496]  The report compiled by the Independent Inquiry in the September 11th World Trade Center attacks warns the American public that the government's official version of events does not stand up to scrutiny.
[01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:03.499]  And the man who put this on was Colonel Don DeGrande, who's an American,
[01:02:04.139 --> 01:02:23.895]  And the 72-hour non-stop symposium deliberation by a group of military and civilian pilots under the chairmanship of Colonel Don DeGrande, after deliberating non-stop for 72 hours, has concluded that the flight crews of the four passenger airliners involved in the September 11 tragedy had no control over their aircraft.
[01:02:25.216 --> 01:02:27.437]  And they get into how the Globalists clearly carried it out.
[01:02:27.498 --> 01:02:30.360]  Now, this was two years ago, folks.
[01:02:31.738 --> 01:02:32.939]  A very cutting-edge.
[01:02:33.039 --> 01:02:38.662]  Now, the mainstream foreign press has addressed it, and most Europeans believe the U.S.
[01:02:38.682 --> 01:02:39.763]  government carried it out.
[01:02:40.283 --> 01:02:49.729]  A lot of Americans are now waking up and talking to this trailblazer, cutting-edge pioneer, Colonel Don DeGrande.
[01:02:49.949 --> 01:02:52.331]  It's an honor, sir, to have you on the show.
[01:02:55.427 --> 01:02:57.511]  Hey Alex, it's good to be aboard.
[01:02:57.531 --> 01:02:59.053]  It's good to be here.
[01:02:59.073 --> 01:03:02.359]  We're going to break here in about a minute and a half, but give folks your bio.
[01:03:02.619 --> 01:03:04.522]  Tell us about Colonel Don DeGrande.
[01:03:05.644 --> 01:03:08.509]  Well, you've got part of the name correct.
[01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.046]  It's a hyper-native word.
[01:03:11.066 --> 01:03:11.627]  Colonel Don DeGranpre.
[01:03:11.647 --> 01:03:13.408]  The last name, it's Granpre.
[01:03:13.808 --> 01:03:15.710]  Yes, Colonel Don DeGranpre.
[01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:22.534]  That's how I addressed you this morning and on the website, but the Portugal newspaper just says Colonel Don DeGran, so.
[01:03:22.834 --> 01:03:23.515]  That's okay.
[01:03:23.595 --> 01:03:26.417]  I've talked to these guys and they're good.
[01:03:27.297 --> 01:03:28.838]  They almost got it correct.
[01:03:30.059 --> 01:03:31.360]  I'll give you a quick bio.
[01:03:32.821 --> 01:03:35.183]  I entered the military in 1944 as a
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:43.121]  Eighteen-year-old radio operator, Morse Code, and I was sent to Burma and China.
[01:03:43.861 --> 01:04:00.844]  I was attached to Detachment 101, which was OSS, and I operated out of Burma, and then later on in Kunming, China, along with such notable people as a tall, skinny gal by the name of Julia Child.
[01:04:01.564 --> 01:04:06.845]  She's since put on a little weight, and now she's doing television commercials, I guess.
[01:04:07.705 --> 01:04:26.170]  But I came back on active duty in 1950 as a commissioned officer, infantry airborne, and I got involved in the Korean fracas for a year and a half until I was wounded.
[01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:29.831]  Then I was shipped home for two years while I recuperated.
[01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:44.788]  I'll tell you what, Colonel Don DeGranpre, let's stay right there, let's recap when we get back and go over the rest of your bio, and then launch into this amazing symposium you put on two years ago and why you did it in Portugal.
[01:04:45.709 --> 01:04:50.712]  So stay with us, his first interview in over a year, and we're honored to have Colonel Don DeGranpre.
[01:04:53.922 --> 01:04:58.427]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:58.767 --> 01:05:02.851]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:03.152 --> 01:05:03.712]  We listened.
[01:05:04.012 --> 01:05:08.998]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:09.278 --> 01:05:09.758]  We listened.
[01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:13.182]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:13.602 --> 01:05:14.123]  We listened.
[01:05:14.583 --> 01:05:18.645]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:19.025 --> 01:05:19.525]  We listened.
[01:05:19.865 --> 01:05:25.107]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:25.507 --> 01:05:26.888]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:27.228 --> 01:05:34.631]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[01:05:45.493 --> 01:05:56.644]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:56.844 --> 01:06:01.288]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.409 --> 01:06:02.630]  There is a chance
[01:06:03.422 --> 01:06:05.784]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:05.824 --> 01:06:08.627]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:06:08.967 --> 01:06:13.171]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.251 --> 01:06:20.178]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.298 --> 01:06:22.320]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:33.005]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.285 --> 01:06:38.688]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:06:55.239 --> 01:06:55.940]  You heard that right.
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.502]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[01:06:58.662 --> 01:06:59.583]  You don't have to pay them off.
[01:06:59.843 --> 01:07:01.165]  The banks are defrauding you.
[01:07:01.405 --> 01:07:02.966]  Now is the time to fight back.
[01:07:03.206 --> 01:07:05.909]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[01:07:06.129 --> 01:07:07.030]  The procedure's easy.
[01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:09.791]  And everything is done legally and within the law.
[01:07:10.011 --> 01:07:11.392]  Almost no one has ever failed.

[01:07:24.456 --> 01:07:28.898]  Believe it or not, mortgage debt elimination has been done for thousands for more than ten years.

[01:07:30.758 --> 01:07:31.639]  Fight back America.

[01:07:56.112 --> 01:07:58.914]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:04.353]  We're talking to Colonel Don DeGrand Prix.
[01:08:04.913 --> 01:08:19.668]  We have a news article about an incredible symposium he put on two years ago in Portugal, covered by Front Page newspaper and magazine, Portugal's, one of their major papers.
[01:08:20.949 --> 01:08:22.971]  And a lot of key info came out.
[01:08:23.192 --> 01:08:24.473]  Very cutting edge.
[01:08:25.595 --> 01:08:32.720]  And this is his first interview since he had a stroke, what, over a year ago, and it's great to have the Colonel on the show.
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:45.889]  So he got into OSS right at the end of World War II, then went into Korea for a year and a half, was wounded with the Airborne, and that's where we left off, Colonel.
[01:08:45.949 --> 01:08:47.450]  Please continue with your bio.
[01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:49.091]  Okay, Alex.
[01:08:50.356 --> 01:08:54.917]  Actually, I went to work then for SecDef Bob McNamara.
[01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:59.318]  He hired me as the Chief Arms Negotiator for the Middle East.
[01:09:01.799 --> 01:09:03.719]  We conducted our business there.
[01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:10.941]  We were known as the super salesmen in ISA, International Security Affairs.
[01:09:10.961 --> 01:09:17.823]  Over a ten year period, we sold over a hundred billion dollars worth of military equipment to all comers.
[01:09:21.807 --> 01:09:27.608]  Then, you mentioned the interview in Portugal.
[01:09:28.068 --> 01:09:50.773]  I didn't actually go to Portugal, but on 11 September, actually it was 12 September, I wrote to my friend General Hugh Shelton, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs at that time, he was transisting out, and he was replaced by General Richard, what the heck was
[01:09:52.350 --> 01:10:03.275]  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the name escapes me, but he was a four-star Air Force General, and Myers, I guess, was the name.
[01:10:03.296 --> 01:10:20.184]  At any rate, I called together from 16 through 19 September in the Pentagon area, not in the Pentagon, a group of military, civilian, and general aviation pilots.
[01:10:20.706 --> 01:10:26.290]  And for three days we kicked around what actually happened on 11 September.
[01:10:27.491 --> 01:10:36.357]  And then the investigative journalist covered that and it was reported in the Portugal News and very accurate.
[01:10:37.718 --> 01:10:47.766]  I have the report in front of me and it is quite involved but if you have some questions, fire away Alex.
[01:10:48.584 --> 01:10:56.512]  Well, now, you got these military officers together, and then I guess the only place I ever saw it get reported on was here in Portugal, talked about the symposium.
[01:10:56.912 --> 01:10:59.315]  Of course, I've read one of your fine books.
[01:10:59.975 --> 01:11:03.257]  And we'll talk about that as well a little bit later in the show and take some calls.
[01:11:04.378 --> 01:11:11.302]  But what was laid out, what I saw in the four-page article two years ago, has turned out to be very accurate.
[01:11:11.822 --> 01:11:20.208]  Tell us about the military officers, the pilots, the civilian pilots that were there, and the conclusions you came to in the 72-hour non-stop
[01:11:25.265 --> 01:11:26.465]  Please go over that for us.
[01:11:27.066 --> 01:11:28.126]  Okay, Alex.
[01:11:28.287 --> 01:11:38.393]  The group of pilots, and they will remain anonymous, were a wonderful mix of commercial, military, and civilian pilots.
[01:11:39.313 --> 01:11:50.400]  At any rate, after three days, the decisions were unanimous, and I wrote my 24-page report up and submitted it to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
[01:11:51.457 --> 01:11:59.561]  And that report ultimately got into the hands of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on 23 January 2002.
[01:11:59.641 --> 01:12:04.684]  The General was a U.S.
[01:12:04.724 --> 01:12:06.845]  Marine Corps General by the name of Peter Pace.
[01:12:08.206 --> 01:12:20.052]  And I got a telephone call, 5 March, from one of his horse holders, who was a Colonel Air Force type, and he informed me that
[01:12:21.075 --> 01:12:40.623]  General Peter Pace had gotten the 24 pages, and that he in effect had no comment at this time, but he used the old Marine Corps lingo, Semper Fi, or Always Faithful, and we let it go at that.
[01:12:41.063 --> 01:12:48.586]  Later on I continued my correspondence with the Vice Chairman, and most recently I got a letter, 8 November 2003, from Peter Pace.
[01:12:51.378 --> 01:13:00.686]  To me, carrying on about not only the investigation, but about the three books that I've written since that time.
[01:13:02.947 --> 01:13:17.539]  Now, Colonel, going over your report and the committee meeting you guys had to put out what you believe really happened,
[01:13:18.931 --> 01:13:24.174]  Now, as more evidence has come out, it shows that that's clearly exactly what happened.
[01:13:24.755 --> 01:13:29.518]  Now they're using 9-11 to turn this country into a total police state.
[01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:34.440]  I mean, how do you see us turning this around?
[01:13:36.962 --> 01:13:39.864]  The turning around is not going to be that easy.
[01:13:40.664 --> 01:13:47.448]  I look at the final paragraph of this Portage Report, and here's what the final paragraph said.
[01:13:47.913 --> 01:13:56.396]  So far, the mainstream American news media has failed to publish or broadcast any details regarding the independent inquiry.
[01:13:57.096 --> 01:14:04.939]  Similarly, the White House, whilst having received a copy of the report, has remained silent on its findings.
[01:14:05.899 --> 01:14:11.101]  Well, we know that a copy... First of all, I have to back up a little.
[01:14:11.361 --> 01:14:14.762]  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs had 500 copies of this 24-page report made.
[01:14:17.757 --> 01:14:21.478]  And sent out, including the White House.
[01:14:22.739 --> 01:14:25.780]  And I have to say it was including President Bush.
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.041]  So they got a copy of the report.
[01:14:28.341 --> 01:14:30.322]  That was Myers at the time.
[01:14:30.942 --> 01:14:31.662]  That is correct.
[01:14:32.443 --> 01:14:37.605]  And so, I mean, if he sent out 500 copies, that would mean that he believed in it.
[01:14:38.685 --> 01:14:42.607]  I'm quite sure that he believed in it, and I think that he still believes in it.
[01:14:44.667 --> 01:14:46.208]  You can understand the difficulties.
[01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:56.374]  The administration, the civilian administration, of course, won't recognize it as such.
[01:14:57.855 --> 01:15:01.436]  How did you find out that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs had sent this out?
[01:15:02.837 --> 01:15:17.883]  I got a telephone call, and I think the date was 5 March 2002, stating that at the time, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs had no comment, but he used the Marine Corps lingo, Semper Fi.
[01:15:19.221 --> 01:15:19.361]  It's
[01:15:39.042 --> 01:15:50.047]  Well, that had to be upsetting to Mr. Rumsfeld to have all these hundreds of your report flying around the Pentagon.
[01:15:50.067 --> 01:16:03.313]  You see, there's a definite cleavage between the military of the Pentagon and the civilian hierarchy.
[01:16:03.999 --> 01:16:06.279]  And never the twain shall meet.
[01:16:06.299 --> 01:16:18.102]  Well, there was an article right after the events you talk about, in mid-2002, the Washington Times saying the morale of the Pentagon had never been lower.
[01:16:19.102 --> 01:16:32.004]  And you would think it would be high, you know, after 9-11 and, you know, getting together to fight the enemy, but it said that the officers didn't believe in the, quote, mission or in the intelligence.
[01:16:32.842 --> 01:16:33.542]  That is correct.
[01:16:33.602 --> 01:16:40.846]  That came out of the Washington Times, and I can verify that from Colonel Dick Schultz, who is a friend of mine and the Joint Chiefs.
[01:16:42.727 --> 01:16:55.873]  Morale was not only low, but he said some of the troops are ready to mutiny, and if it wasn't for the fact that the government, the civilian hierarchy has control over retirements,
[01:16:57.014 --> 01:16:59.816]  They'd probably be blood in the streets by now.
[01:17:00.156 --> 01:17:03.498]  There was also an article where they panicked in the Washington Times.
[01:17:03.599 --> 01:17:04.779]  It was also the Washington Post.
[01:17:04.799 --> 01:17:11.064]  They panicked and flew the officers on jets to luxury vacations and had these focus groups.
[01:17:12.365 --> 01:17:14.306]  It even talked about a possible mutiny.
[01:17:16.347 --> 01:17:18.229]  People were just totally distraught.
[01:17:18.549 --> 01:17:22.652]  What would make them become distraught overnight in the Pentagon?
[01:17:23.092 --> 01:17:24.553]  Well, it wasn't an overnight thing.
[01:17:25.134 --> 01:17:36.798]  You see, as I outline in book one, and I carry that on in book two as well as book three, we were on the verge of a military coup d'etat.
[01:17:38.258 --> 01:17:51.102]  And this was long in the planning, and even after the 78 days of bombing Kosovo it became critical, and we were close to a coup d'etat at that time.
[01:17:56.947 --> 01:18:08.656]  A coup was a possibility.
[01:18:09.136 --> 01:18:14.480]  In fact, a coup d'etat was pulled on the morning of September 11th.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:19.403]  It was an administrative or what we call a cold coup d'etat.
[01:18:19.423 --> 01:18:21.205]  A reverse coup d'etat.
[01:18:24.496 --> 01:18:27.879]  And a counter-revolutionary junta.
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.681]  Well, that is correct.
[01:18:31.822 --> 01:18:49.336]  And as we delved into that, we found that the culprits, including Rumsfeld, were part of a neocon group that had been planning this thing for literally years prior to September 11th.
[01:18:51.267 --> 01:18:52.208]  Absolutely, Colonel.
[01:18:52.288 --> 01:18:55.169]  It's just amazing, picking your brain.
[01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:56.650]  We're going to break here.
[01:18:56.710 --> 01:18:59.291]  I want to just come back.
[01:18:59.331 --> 01:19:04.673]  Talking to you this morning, I was proud to know that you've been a listener to the show for a while.
[01:19:05.734 --> 01:19:19.981]  Well, I've had a single sideband shortwave set for about four years, and I listened very faithfully to Alex Jones, particularly, up until about two years ago.
[01:19:22.955 --> 01:19:28.861]  As a result of the events of September 11th, I did have a stroke.
[01:19:28.981 --> 01:19:30.122]  I'm fully recovered.
[01:19:30.162 --> 01:19:35.747]  As I told Alex, I went riding my favorite corner horse this morning.
[01:19:36.348 --> 01:19:39.170]  So I'm back and I'm ready for anything.
[01:19:39.511 --> 01:19:40.632]  Well, that's wonderful, Colonel.
[01:19:41.472 --> 01:19:44.916]  Okay, we'll break and come back with the Colonel.
[01:19:46.016 --> 01:19:50.917]  And get into all of this and later get to your calls too, so please stay with us.

[01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:53.827]  Is America bankrupt?
[01:21:54.028 --> 01:21:56.570]  Are we on the verge of an all-out economic collapse?
[01:21:56.890 --> 01:21:59.351]  What can be done to protect your family and assets?
[01:21:59.591 --> 01:22:02.673]  What kinds of investments will be able to withstand an economic meltdown?

[01:23:58.975 --> 01:24:06.801]  Folks, we'll take some of your calls for Colonel Don DeGrampre coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:08.142 --> 01:24:09.363]  He's done a lot of great work.
[01:24:09.383 --> 01:24:10.644]  I've only read one of his books.
[01:24:12.185 --> 01:24:17.048]  Don, tell us about some of your books and what they cover and how folks can get a copy.
[01:24:29.170 --> 01:24:36.776]  Serpent Sting, Book 2 is The Viper's Venom, Book 3, which just came out, is The Rattler's Revenge.
[01:24:38.097 --> 01:24:42.140]  I'd like to quote from Book 2, which came out October of 2002.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:45.663]  There's a very important paragraph there.
[01:24:45.683 --> 01:24:54.069]  It says, The trigger for the 9-11 activity was the imminent and unstoppable worldwide financial collapse
[01:24:54.557 --> 01:25:00.100]  Which can only be prevented temporarily by a major war, perhaps to become known as World War III.
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:06.342]  To bring it off one more time, martial law will probably be imposed in the United States.
[01:25:07.823 --> 01:25:11.465]  And now we've seen General Eberhardt say that that's the next step.
[01:25:11.905 --> 01:25:14.146]  Tommy Frank said that's the next step.
[01:25:14.726 --> 01:25:16.687]  Are those not chilling statements?
[01:25:17.687 --> 01:25:18.428]  Yes, they are.
[01:25:19.368 --> 01:25:23.090]  This next step was
[01:25:23.769 --> 01:25:30.290]  We'll be preceded by what I write up in Book One, The Serpent's Sting.
[01:25:31.091 --> 01:25:34.391]  I wrote of a coming coup d'etat.
[01:25:35.552 --> 01:25:42.873]  And this was written in the year 2000, and sure as blazes, it's coming.
[01:25:44.093 --> 01:25:50.995]  And it'll be preceded by these kinds of things as enunciated by Tommy Franks, among others.
[01:25:52.728 --> 01:25:54.929]  So we're in a world of hurt, Alex.
[01:25:55.389 --> 01:26:02.770]  Now, by coup d'etat, do you mean another intensification of a reverse coup d'etat to keep the people from fighting against the New World Order?
[01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:08.332]  Or do you mean the type that Bill Clinton successfully stopped in his administration?
[01:26:09.452 --> 01:26:14.093]  Well, I'm talking about the administrative coup d'etat that came off September 11th.
[01:26:14.173 --> 01:26:16.814]  You're talking about an intensification... September 11th.
[01:26:16.834 --> 01:26:21.135]  You're talking about an intensification of the elite in a coup d'etat against America.
[01:26:21.595 --> 01:26:22.255]  That is correct.
[01:26:23.655 --> 01:26:24.916]  Well, I mean, it's ongoing.
[01:26:24.956 --> 01:26:26.496]  They're federalizing everything.
[01:26:26.516 --> 01:26:27.997]  They're militarizing everything.
[01:26:28.257 --> 01:26:30.778]  They're engaging in the classic takeover, are they not?
[01:26:31.318 --> 01:26:32.058]  Yes, they are.
[01:26:32.419 --> 01:26:48.725]  And from this, Alex, and I bring this out very clearly in book three, the only way we can stop it is with the classic counter coup d'etat, where the military steps in.
[01:26:50.006 --> 01:26:53.227]  And under the aegis of the military itself,
[01:26:55.853 --> 01:27:06.311]  Disengaging or disemboweling the civilian hierarchy and taking over and re-running and reorganizing the federal government.
[01:27:07.921 --> 01:27:20.369]  Now, the problem is they've got so many CFR minions in the Pentagon, we know that Clinton had some officers terminated in their offices, you know, shot multiple times and the rest of it.
[01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:28.755]  We know that happened, but the question is, how many of the high-level officers are on the globalist team?
[01:27:31.937 --> 01:27:35.539]  I can only say several of the highest level
[01:27:36.261 --> 01:27:39.122]  Our members now of the Council of Foreign Relations.
[01:27:39.682 --> 01:27:47.825]  The important thing to consider is how many of them are sincere in their beliefs as enunciated by the CFR.
[01:27:48.405 --> 01:27:56.048]  I believe there are several sleepers and I believe I know some of them personally who are three and four star generals.
[01:27:56.708 --> 01:28:03.251]  They're members of the CFR but their heart belongs to Jesus if I can use that expression because
[01:28:04.184 --> 01:28:07.166]  They are true Semper Fidelity people.
[01:28:07.907 --> 01:28:09.468]  Some of them happen to be Marines.
[01:28:10.889 --> 01:28:14.132]  And I'm counting on them to do the right thing.
[01:28:15.613 --> 01:28:17.174]  And I bring this out in Book 3.
[01:28:18.115 --> 01:28:20.256]  Absolutely, and we'll tell folks how they can get those books.
[01:28:20.276 --> 01:28:29.784]  I mean, I want to carry them, but Colonel, your experience in the military, your experience in the intelligence agencies,
[01:28:31.812 --> 01:28:41.561]  There's also the danger, though, obviously, in any military movement of that nature, that it could be self-serving as well and set up its own form of wickedness.
[01:28:43.302 --> 01:28:45.104]  Yes, that's plausible.
[01:28:45.164 --> 01:28:46.145]  That's correct.
[01:28:47.386 --> 01:28:50.849]  I don't believe it'll happen in exactly that fashion.
[01:28:51.349 --> 01:28:57.915]  And the thing about a coup d'etat and a counter-coup d'etat is you never know when it's going to happen.
[01:28:58.536 --> 01:29:09.326]  You never know exactly who's involved and this is a plus for any planners of a counter coup d'etat.
[01:29:09.426 --> 01:29:24.260]  Well this is certainly dividing the wheat from the chaff because how many people, and we'll get the answer to the question when we get back, from your feelers in the Pentagon, how many people in there now know that an element of the global system, a crime syndicate,
[01:29:24.975 --> 01:29:25.796]  Carried out 9-11.
[01:29:26.236 --> 01:29:38.143]  I mean, only an idiot would think they didn't, but the point is, this has got to be accelerating the division, and I want to get your take on the pulse of that.
[01:29:38.203 --> 01:29:40.065]  We'll take calls when we get back.
[01:29:40.085 --> 01:29:40.545]  Stay with us.
[01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:44.027]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.528 --> 01:29:46.149]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:49.731]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.075 --> 01:29:57.777]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:29:58.017 --> 01:30:01.459]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:30:01.679 --> 01:30:04.140]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:12.983]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[01:30:13.344 --> 01:30:19.106]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[01:30:19.386 --> 01:30:21.347]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[01:30:21.587 --> 01:30:28.508]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[01:30:28.848 --> 01:30:35.310]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.

[01:31:46.142 --> 01:31:46.202]  P.O.
[01:31:46.282 --> 01:31:46.924]  Box 1227 Jacksonville, Oregon 97530.
[01:31:53.271 --> 01:31:55.613]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:31:55.874 --> 01:31:59.698]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:32:00.038 --> 01:32:00.859]  Read the labels.
[01:32:01.279 --> 01:32:05.423]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:32:05.623 --> 01:32:09.808]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:32:10.188 --> 01:32:15.073]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:32:15.453 --> 01:32:19.014]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[01:32:43.001 --> 01:32:44.181]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:44.241 --> 01:32:45.342]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:05.811 --> 01:33:08.413]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:08.453 --> 01:33:09.353]  until 2 p.m.
[01:33:09.413 --> 01:33:11.475]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:33:11.875 --> 01:33:13.056]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:13.076 --> 01:33:17.558]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:33:17.899 --> 01:33:22.141]  Don't forget our backup mirror site, InfoWars.net.
[01:33:22.522 --> 01:33:25.864]  There's also JonesReport.com and VirginUtah.com.
[01:33:27.325 --> 01:33:32.408]  We're about to launch a new website, by the way, that you're going to want to hear about, but that's in a few weeks.
[01:33:34.011 --> 01:33:40.676]  We're talking to Colonel Don DeGrand Prix and worked at many different levels of the U.S.
[01:33:40.716 --> 01:33:44.418]  military and has put out some really important information.
[01:33:45.559 --> 01:33:50.202]  Two years ago, he put out a report in a meeting in a 72-hour deliberation
[01:33:54.761 --> 01:33:56.462]  A group of military and civilian U.S.
[01:33:56.523 --> 01:34:15.498]  pilots under the chairmanship of Colonel Don DeGran, after deliberating non-stop for 72 hours, has concluded that the flight crews of the four passenger airliners involved in the September 11th tragedy had no control over the aircraft, and they get into how the military-industrial complex clearly, that is, elements of it, were in control of this.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:21.103]  Colonel, we're going to go to some calls here in a few minutes after you've covered some other issues with us.
[01:34:22.296 --> 01:34:34.218]  But to understand this, you know, my question of what percentage of the officer's period in the military do you think have finally woken up to the true magnitude of what's going on?
[01:34:35.439 --> 01:34:43.220]  Well, I'm in personal contact at least on a weekly basis with the Joint Chiefs and other select people.
[01:34:44.861 --> 01:34:51.742]  My computation is that 70% of us are with us.
[01:34:53.935 --> 01:35:02.939]  That's the higher-ranking military, field grade officers, etc., and even the first three graders of the enlisted.
[01:35:03.639 --> 01:35:06.720]  Seventy percent are with us.
[01:35:08.541 --> 01:35:12.662]  Well, they've had questionnaires, you know, a decade ago, will you fire on U.S.
[01:35:12.702 --> 01:35:13.723]  citizens under U.N.
[01:35:13.763 --> 01:35:16.103]  control if the President says so?
[01:35:16.203 --> 01:35:18.604]  And, you know, seventy-four percent say no to that.
[01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:24.458]  Okay, but how are the globalists getting away with this?
[01:35:26.459 --> 01:35:38.505]  Sure, it's one big bluff and we can thank many of the neocons who are now in power in the Defense Department particularly.
[01:35:38.525 --> 01:35:46.549]  They get away with it because they try it out and see if anybody will salute the flag and
[01:35:47.833 --> 01:35:48.593]  That's the way it goes.
[01:35:49.193 --> 01:35:58.156]  So basically they wrap their un-American agenda in the flag and the general public buys it so the military has to sit there and take it.
[01:35:58.876 --> 01:36:03.277]  They do, yes, and I think those days are coming to an end.
[01:36:03.297 --> 01:36:07.379]  The military ain't going to take it any longer.
[01:36:07.399 --> 01:36:15.801]  Well, I mean, how did the military ever get convinced to use depleted uranium in areas where there's going to be troops?
[01:36:17.082 --> 01:36:18.323]  To put what, Alex?
[01:36:18.843 --> 01:36:21.825]  Well, I mean, yeah, the military gets treated like dog meat.
[01:36:21.905 --> 01:36:31.110]  You've got the depleted uranium, Colonel, where they spray depleted uranium everywhere and then the troops breathe it at 1,900 times safe levels.
[01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:33.812]  I mean, yeah, I mean, how can the Pentagon put up with that?
[01:36:35.313 --> 01:36:40.936]  Well, the DU rounds are overplayed, first of all.
[01:36:45.276 --> 01:36:46.977]  They aren't that potent.
[01:36:47.618 --> 01:37:01.767]  And secondarily, we must consider that weapons of mass destruction have already been used by some of the opposition in the period February of 1991.
[01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:09.012]  Weapons of mass destruction including low-yield nuclear weapons.
[01:37:09.973 --> 01:37:12.615]  Okay, can you break that down for us?
[01:37:14.617 --> 01:37:31.082]  Well, I break it down in the time frame that we had satellite images of rounds or missiles being fired from the Negev Desert toward Baghdad.
[01:37:31.102 --> 01:37:40.645]  That's 600 miles distance and six or eight of the rounds came in.
[01:37:41.809 --> 01:37:43.291]  That was February of 1991.
[01:37:44.373 --> 01:37:47.357]  Are you saying the Israelis use miniaturized nuclear weapons?
[01:37:47.538 --> 01:37:47.998]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:48.559 --> 01:37:50.282]  That's what I'm saying in plain English.
[01:37:50.843 --> 01:37:56.191]  Well, I remember, and I know they brag, they have a lot of really sophisticated miniaturized nuclear weapons.
[01:37:56.849 --> 01:37:57.409]  That is correct.
[01:37:57.429 --> 01:38:00.150]  And I have verification of that.
[01:38:00.170 --> 01:38:01.530]  I think it's in book two.
[01:38:28.755 --> 01:38:35.222]  Well, I know your work on September 11th certainly has.
[01:38:36.483 --> 01:38:42.731]  Do you think the globalists are going to have the will to carry out another massive attack here in the US to try to
[01:38:43.354 --> 01:38:44.855]  Well, that's a two-pronged question, Alex.
[01:38:44.875 --> 01:38:45.935]  I think it deserves a studied answer.
[01:38:45.956 --> 01:38:48.317]  The only thing I can say is I'm not sure of how it will turn out.
[01:39:14.316 --> 01:39:15.537]  It's very dangerous.
[01:39:16.477 --> 01:39:23.922]  Well, from watching The Globalist, I think they had a plan, they're still following a plan, but I think they're shook up.
[01:39:24.022 --> 01:39:32.247]  I think from the evidence, in fact I know from the evidence, a lot of things they planned haven't gone according to schedule, and so they don't know what to do right now.
[01:39:32.827 --> 01:39:33.668]  This is correct.
[01:39:33.728 --> 01:39:40.352]  I think it's personified in the persona of the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz.
[01:39:41.417 --> 01:39:53.466]  They almost got him in Baghdad when they fired the salvo one night of weaponry and they scared Paul Wolfowitz off.
[01:39:53.506 --> 01:39:54.807]  He's ready to resign.
[01:39:54.827 --> 01:39:58.149]  Do you think that was U.S.
[01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:59.110]  forces doing that?
[01:39:59.710 --> 01:40:00.311]  I believe it.
[01:40:01.572 --> 01:40:03.513]  It was very well planned again.
[01:40:03.833 --> 01:40:05.635]  And only U.S.
[01:40:05.655 --> 01:40:07.616]  forces would know that he would be there.
[01:40:07.876 --> 01:40:08.577]  That is correct.
[01:40:09.602 --> 01:40:14.944]  And the precision of those weapons that came in and into the hotel.
[01:40:15.324 --> 01:40:30.028]  There were 11 rounds in all and I can speak from authenticity that they scared the hell out of Paul Wolfowitz and probably C. Paul Brenner or whatever his name is.
[01:40:30.288 --> 01:40:30.608]  Bremmer?
[01:40:31.428 --> 01:40:34.729]  Why does the Pentagon, elements of the Pentagon hate Wolfowitz?
[01:40:36.897 --> 01:40:40.180]  Wolfowitz has been in this game since 1974.
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:47.305]  I was still on active duty when I met him in 1974, and he was coming on strong even then.
[01:40:47.665 --> 01:40:54.950]  And along with him, Richard Pearl, and a couple of the others who are now known as New Conservatives.
[01:40:55.491 --> 01:40:59.714]  Now Pearl had the nickname as the Crazy and the Prince of Darkness, correct?
[01:41:00.034 --> 01:41:00.695]  That is correct.
[01:41:01.855 --> 01:41:03.557]  Why was he known as the Prince of Darkness?
[01:41:08.919 --> 01:41:10.400]  I can't answer that directly.
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:22.210]  He was a snake to begin with, but nothing was ever straightforward as far as Richard Perle was concerned.
[01:41:22.651 --> 01:41:32.559]  I introduced Book Three to a quote stating that Richard Perle is a madman, and it goes on from there.
[01:41:33.874 --> 01:41:34.875]  Well, he is a madman.
[01:41:34.935 --> 01:41:43.341]  He was at a press dinner last year and, again, giggling and laughing about how we're going to have World War III, we're going to nuke everyone, ha ha ha.
[01:41:44.062 --> 01:41:45.723]  And then he goes, isn't that impressive?
[01:41:45.763 --> 01:41:47.484]  And, like, sort of grabbing on some women.
[01:41:47.544 --> 01:41:49.426]  I mean, he's a complete lunatic.
[01:41:50.226 --> 01:41:51.387]  That is correct.
[01:41:52.068 --> 01:41:54.409]  Richard Perle's days are numbered.
[01:41:54.609 --> 01:42:03.116]  I don't know if he realizes it, but so many of these so-called neocons, you'll notice now that they are very quiet indeed.
[01:42:04.146 --> 01:42:09.553]  Uh, they're not really surfacing anymore, including Dick Cheney.
[01:42:10.774 --> 01:42:14.199]  Yeah, why has Dick Cheney been literally hiding under a bunker?
[01:42:14.219 --> 01:42:18.924]  He's been hiding under a bunker most of the time since September 11th.
[01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:27.124]  And by the way, it has come out that he took control of NORAD and was saying something in the U.S.
[01:42:28.524 --> 01:42:34.568]  ultra-secret bunkers that he was on loudspeakers ordering people to follow his orders.
[01:42:34.628 --> 01:42:36.569]  He had to physically take control of something.
[01:42:36.969 --> 01:42:40.851]  From my sources, it was the fact that they were going to go ahead and shoot the aircraft down.
[01:42:42.012 --> 01:42:46.414]  That's what I've got from lawyers who represent military officers.
[01:42:46.714 --> 01:42:48.455]  We know he was in control, though.
[01:42:49.175 --> 01:42:53.097]  Even during the hijackings, the supposed hijackings, what do you know about that?
[01:42:54.898 --> 01:42:57.199]  Well, not too much, really.
[01:42:58.279 --> 01:43:01.080]  I can't speak to that because it's hypothetical.
[01:43:01.721 --> 01:43:06.423]  And what I try to stick to are cold hard facts.
[01:43:06.783 --> 01:43:09.744]  Well, I mean, Colonel, we know he did take control of the bunkers.
[01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:13.226]  We just don't know what he said, according to ABC News.
[01:43:13.466 --> 01:43:18.008]  But according to my sources, who've been very accurate, he was ordering the stand down.
[01:43:19.139 --> 01:43:20.620]  Yes, I can believe it.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:31.426]  But again, it's supposition and I still haven't been able to figure out what makes Dick Cheney tick.
[01:43:31.486 --> 01:43:33.607]  So why is he hiding in a bunker?
[01:43:34.928 --> 01:43:38.510]  Why is he at the Naval Observatory in a bunker most of the time?
[01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:44.093]  I think that's what he considers to be the safest place at the moment.
[01:43:46.094 --> 01:43:48.495]  He's basically a coward.
[01:43:51.466 --> 01:43:54.028]  And this too will come out.
[01:43:54.368 --> 01:44:00.694]  I feel that Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz, both of them, their days are numbered.
[01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:12.704]  Okay, so politically, more and more corruption coming out, more and more of their criminal activities coming out, serious issues.
[01:44:13.325 --> 01:44:16.868]  Colonel, how do folks get your books, the three-part series?
[01:44:18.130 --> 01:44:21.272]  Okay, the book is easy to come by.
[01:44:22.532 --> 01:44:26.574]  My incomparable daughter, Doniva, is the publisher of these books.
[01:44:27.274 --> 01:44:31.696]  And they're turning out top grade library quality books.
[01:44:32.897 --> 01:44:36.439]  Books 1, 2, and 3, Barbarians Inside the Gates.
[01:44:37.119 --> 01:44:42.281]  They can be obtained by writing post office box 1124, Madison, Virginia.
[01:44:46.638 --> 01:44:47.478]  We're good to go.
[01:45:13.487 --> 01:45:23.156]  All right, these are thick books, jam-packed, and the address is 1124 Madison, Virginia, and that zip code again?
[01:45:23.176 --> 01:45:23.156]  22727.
[01:45:26.579 --> 01:45:29.322]  All right, and does that $30 include the shipping?
[01:45:30.763 --> 01:45:32.225]  No, it really doesn't.
[01:45:32.505 --> 01:45:36.689]  For the books, we send them all out priority, special handling.
[01:45:37.692 --> 01:45:40.614]  That runs $3.85 a book.
[01:45:40.915 --> 01:45:41.715]  Okay, gotcha.
[01:45:42.216 --> 01:45:43.857]  Alright, we'll give that out again a little bit later.
[01:45:44.117 --> 01:45:45.658]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:45:45.718 --> 01:45:47.560]  Thanks for holding, folks.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:51.062]  Whatever issue you bring up, I'm sure the Colonel can comment on.
[01:45:51.663 --> 01:45:53.284]  Glenn in Colorado, thanks for holding.
[01:45:53.304 --> 01:45:53.744]  Go ahead.
[01:45:54.885 --> 01:45:56.146]  Okay, put him on hold.
[01:45:56.546 --> 01:45:57.567]  He's got his radio on.
[01:45:57.627 --> 01:45:58.888]  Glenn, we'll come back to you in a few minutes.
[01:45:59.669 --> 01:46:00.710]  Brian in Texas.
[01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:01.670]  Brian, go ahead.
[01:46:02.751 --> 01:46:04.012]  Yeah, hey, what's going on, Alex?
[01:46:04.032 --> 01:46:04.432]  Fine, sir.
[01:46:04.472 --> 01:46:04.793]  Go ahead.
[01:46:05.663 --> 01:46:06.583]  Yeah, I've been on hold for a while.
[01:46:06.663 --> 01:46:09.645]  Sorry to kind of switch subjects like this, but talking about The Passion.
[01:46:10.405 --> 01:46:11.725]  Oh yes, The Passion of Christ.
[01:46:12.326 --> 01:46:13.446]  Right, right, the movie.
[01:46:13.666 --> 01:46:14.366]  I had a question.
[01:46:15.667 --> 01:46:27.452]  I've known in the past that you've talked about people who do these movies like The Skulls, and you kind of paint a picture that it's some agenda to take away from the legitimacy of the argument.
[01:46:27.892 --> 01:46:33.654]  And I wonder, when you talk about conspiracy theory, that's also a Mel Gibson movie, that you don't kind of put it in those same terms.
[01:46:36.019 --> 01:46:56.405]  I'm not going to tell you what I know about Mel Gibson, but I know a lot of private stuff, and I know the family, and I've met a lot of the family, and I'm not going to go any further, but Mel Gibson's the real deal, and knows as much as I do about the New World Order, and listens to these shows, watches my videos, knew about the New World Order when I was in diapers.
[01:46:57.825 --> 01:46:59.205]  Mel Gibson's the real deal.
[01:46:59.265 --> 01:47:01.026]  Colonel, do you have any comments about Mel Gibson?
[01:47:01.770 --> 01:47:06.274]  I know him personally and I know his father Hutton, who is a dear friend of mine.
[01:47:06.334 --> 01:47:15.282]  He was originally from San Antonio, Texas and now Hutton has moved to West Virginia and he's still very active at 85.
[01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:20.166]  Mel is top drawer.
[01:47:21.707 --> 01:47:25.030]  I could find nothing wrong with Mel Gibson whatsoever.
[01:47:25.050 --> 01:47:28.193]  Yeah, so that's what's going on there.
[01:47:29.377 --> 01:47:31.519]  I'm sure he's a great guy and everything.
[01:47:31.559 --> 01:47:34.420]  Mel Gibson's had to pay his dues to get to where he's at.
[01:47:34.841 --> 01:47:36.461]  Now he makes the films he wants.
[01:47:36.822 --> 01:47:37.382]  Patriot.
[01:47:37.442 --> 01:47:38.022]  Braveheart.
[01:47:38.323 --> 01:47:39.403]  The Passion of Christ.
[01:47:40.684 --> 01:47:41.704]  He's doing a great job.
[01:47:42.705 --> 01:47:42.885]  Right.
[01:47:42.925 --> 01:47:43.586]  Making a lot of money.
[01:47:44.046 --> 01:47:44.566]  That's good.
[01:47:44.606 --> 01:47:45.246]  You know what?
[01:47:45.266 --> 01:47:47.848]  It's good to make money if you're doing a good thing.
[01:47:48.168 --> 01:47:48.308]  Yeah.
[01:47:48.348 --> 01:47:50.169]  Nothing wrong with making money.
[01:47:51.070 --> 01:47:53.931]  In fact, I already spent some of my money today.
[01:47:55.566 --> 01:47:56.827]  Hey, thanks a lot, man.
[01:47:56.847 --> 01:47:58.788]  I appreciate it.
[01:47:58.989 --> 01:48:07.115]  You know, this idea that you can't make money, I mean, look, let's say I could make a hundred videos and hand them out for free.
[01:48:07.975 --> 01:48:11.498]  Or I could sell my videos and be able to get out thousands.
[01:48:12.239 --> 01:48:14.160]  You know, I'm not the Carnegie Foundation.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:20.883]  Now, if I did have $20 billion, yes, I would spend the interest on it each year fighting the New World Order.
[01:48:21.344 --> 01:48:22.784]  But I don't have $20 billion.
[01:48:23.025 --> 01:48:28.607]  Colonel, you want to comment on this trend of, we patriots, you know, should live in cardboard boxes?
[01:48:30.128 --> 01:48:31.469]  No, decidedly not.
[01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:37.952]  We have to, if we're a true patriot, we have to recognize the
[01:48:41.212 --> 01:48:44.553]  policy of making or unmaking money.
[01:48:44.573 --> 01:48:50.996]  We're not giving things away, but we're selling quality and freedom and liberty.
[01:48:51.896 --> 01:48:52.476]  Absolutely.
[01:48:52.536 --> 01:48:53.616]  I mean, you know, check my videos.
[01:48:53.677 --> 01:48:55.117]  I tell people to make copies of them.
[01:48:55.397 --> 01:48:57.978]  And then I get calls going, well, can't you just give me one?
[01:48:57.998 --> 01:49:00.359]  I mean, I could do that for a couple weeks, folks.
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:02.680]  It's funny.
[01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:05.801]  Thanks for the call, Brian.
[01:49:06.481 --> 01:49:08.682]  Let's see if Glenn has got his radio off.
[01:49:09.517 --> 01:49:10.237]  Oh, Glenn hung up.
[01:49:10.337 --> 01:49:11.318]  Okay, well, sorry, Glenn.
[01:49:11.998 --> 01:49:15.200]  Ron in New York, you're on the air with Colonel Don DeGramperie.
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:15.640]  Go ahead.
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:16.520]  Hi, gentlemen.
[01:49:16.881 --> 01:49:20.522]  I was calling about something else, but it'll dovetail into this.
[01:49:21.543 --> 01:49:38.031]  Your last caller, I don't understand his philosophy, other than I do see it being propagated by the corporate media now, in reference to Mel Gibson, that turning a fair and legitimate profit is somehow illicit, so I guess we're supposed to allow Luciferians to make profit, and we're supposed to live, as you say, in a box.
[01:49:38.689 --> 01:49:39.750]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:49:40.110 --> 01:49:44.955]  Well, I mean, how is Mel Gibson going to make more movies if he doesn't make money on things?
[01:49:45.175 --> 01:49:49.238]  Alex, I'm watching the media here in New York that's been critical of that movie.
[01:49:49.498 --> 01:49:52.001]  This is corporate media brainwashing.
[01:49:52.021 --> 01:49:58.466]  This is a subtle way in which they enter your subconscious to make you turn against the person who did something positive.
[01:49:59.107 --> 01:50:03.751]  But yet nobody seems to have a problem with wicked people who make profit.
[01:50:04.625 --> 01:50:05.706]  I'd like to ask you a guess.
[01:50:05.846 --> 01:50:10.551]  Colonel, I'd like to ask you, if you're familiar with Alex Joris, he was threatened by one.
[01:50:11.652 --> 01:50:16.056]  These movie producers now, I guess you could say they're working for Pentagon Productions.
[01:50:16.957 --> 01:50:20.280]  I believe the Kelly Lynch Rescue was one of their main productions.
[01:50:20.841 --> 01:50:23.864]  Alex could probably give you the exact name of the individual.
[01:50:23.904 --> 01:50:25.245]  I believe he was threatened by one.
[01:50:25.605 --> 01:50:26.947]  Yeah, a Lionel Chet one.
[01:50:28.143 --> 01:50:29.504]  Does he know anything about that?
[01:50:29.544 --> 01:50:33.825]  Yeah, we've got elements of the government helping produce these propaganda pieces, Colonel.
[01:50:34.426 --> 01:50:35.806]  We'll get your comment on that when we get back.
[01:50:35.866 --> 01:50:36.566]  Stay there, Ron.
[01:50:37.247 --> 01:50:47.651]  And then we'll go to John and Wayne and Diane and John and everybody else for our guest, Colonel Don DeGrand Prix.
[01:50:48.191 --> 01:50:49.091]  And we'll be right back.
[01:50:49.151 --> 01:50:49.932]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:50.012 --> 01:50:50.352]  Stay with us.
[01:50:53.032 --> 01:51:01.654]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:51:01.874 --> 01:51:13.157]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:51:13.377 --> 01:51:16.018]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:16.358 --> 01:51:22.826]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:51:22.986 --> 01:51:24.868]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:51:25.048 --> 01:51:31.075]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:51:31.335 --> 01:51:37.002]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:51:52.972 --> 01:51:57.294]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:51:57.494 --> 01:52:01.936]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:02.076 --> 01:52:06.438]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:52:06.478 --> 01:52:07.819]  The New World Order.
[01:52:08.679 --> 01:52:10.001]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:23.356 --> 01:52:33.680]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:39.323]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:54:45.698 --> 01:54:53.282]  Very long, very fast-moving though, and just give you a wide-ranging view of the New World Order, and they're full of solutions.
[01:54:53.943 --> 01:55:03.808]  They're $25.95 apiece, $20 when you order three or more of any of the ten films, and then my book's $12, Paul Watson's book's $19, get a second copy for $11.95.

[01:55:32.889 --> 01:55:33.671]  Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:55:37.751 --> 01:55:48.838]  I think what Ron in New York, Colonel Don DeGrand Prix, is getting to is, I turn on shows like Threat Matrix for 24, and on every episode the police are torturing the would-be terrorist.
[01:55:49.198 --> 01:55:53.100]  Torture's good, martial law's good, gun control's good.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:56:02.986]  These messages, not just on the news, but in the television shows, and there's been articles that the military, the government is involved in financing this.
[01:56:03.506 --> 01:56:05.207]  Your response to his question?
[01:56:07.802 --> 01:56:11.364]  Well, I must split the two elements.
[01:56:12.265 --> 01:56:21.691]  The uniformed military, as opposed to the civilian hierarchy, and it flies under the aegis of defense departments.
[01:56:21.711 --> 01:56:22.532]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:56:22.572 --> 01:56:28.116]  The big egghead scientists in suits who are figuring out all the mind control.
[01:56:28.156 --> 01:56:29.417]  We don't mean the military.
[01:56:29.617 --> 01:56:30.837]  You mean like John Poindexter?
[01:56:31.258 --> 01:56:32.539]  Yeah, like John Poindexter.
[01:56:32.699 --> 01:56:35.060]  This is correct, and you've got one of the guys.
[01:56:36.650 --> 01:56:41.091]  But my percentage remained the same.
[01:56:41.772 --> 01:56:48.354]  Seventy percent of the uniformed military are with us, and if push comes to shove, they can prove it.
[01:56:49.334 --> 01:56:53.575]  Do you think that's what's been holding them back from going to full bore, Marshal Law, Colonel?
[01:56:53.975 --> 01:56:54.636]  Yes, I do.
[01:56:55.716 --> 01:56:56.356]  Yes, I do.
[01:56:56.456 --> 01:57:05.659]  They're afraid of the civilian hierarchy and the power that it has in the persona of Homeland Security, et al.
[01:57:06.567 --> 01:57:09.989]  But when the military strikes, it will strike to kill.
[01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:13.052]  Okay, Ron, anything else?
[01:57:13.412 --> 01:57:17.935]  Yes, this gets to something you spoke of last week with police operations.
[01:57:19.096 --> 01:57:25.861]  You had spoken of what I can only describe as home invasions in, I believe you said Houston or the Dallas area, in Texas at the very least.
[01:57:26.604 --> 01:57:32.285]  Where they'll say they hear shots fired, when in fact no shots are fired, so they could actually just go into somebody's home.
[01:57:32.305 --> 01:57:40.427]  Well, their favorite thing is to say, you had a 9-11 call, then you check the records the next day, it never happened, and you just wake up with a SWAT team standing around you.
[01:57:40.447 --> 01:57:44.608]  Alex, that is something that is taking place here in New York.
[01:57:44.708 --> 01:57:48.808]  I had an associate of mine, you know I'm retired, of course, from law enforcement.
[01:57:49.188 --> 01:57:51.529]  And like the military, you have two categories of people.
[01:57:52.679 --> 01:57:59.743]  Those that are basically decent and, you know, believe in the rule of law, as we morally understand that, and then moral degenerates.
[01:58:00.124 --> 01:58:00.804]  That's what's happened.
[01:58:00.844 --> 01:58:01.905]  I'm sorry, but that's the truth.
[01:58:01.945 --> 01:58:03.085]  Who've filtered into that?
[01:58:04.226 --> 01:58:09.669]  And, uh, you will find that these morally degenerated units engage in that here.
[01:58:10.130 --> 01:58:11.851]  That happened just the other day, an open incident.
[01:58:12.611 --> 01:58:13.532]  This is what's going on.
[01:58:13.572 --> 01:58:22.397]  It's like they're trying to graft police and military forces to do dirty work, but they can't get all the police and all the military personnel to go along with it.
[01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:24.401]  And this is slowing them up.
[01:58:25.543 --> 01:58:29.548]  However, they're still out there, and they're still trying to push it, and this is going on.
[01:58:29.628 --> 01:58:31.971]  This is like a battle between the light and the darkness.
[01:58:32.011 --> 01:58:33.112]  This is really what's going on.
[01:58:33.513 --> 01:58:37.177]  It is, and we'll get the Colonel's comments on that and take more calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:58:37.197 --> 01:58:39.280]  We're about to break the third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:51.965]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:58:52.185 --> 01:59:03.471]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:59:03.671 --> 01:59:06.313]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:59:06.653 --> 01:59:13.116]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:59:13.276 --> 01:59:15.157]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:59:15.357 --> 01:59:21.380]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:27.283]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:59:27.623 --> 01:59:31.546]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:31.566 --> 01:59:32.266]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:59:32.306 --> 01:59:33.347]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:33.507 --> 01:59:33.787]  Big Brother.
[01:59:33.807 --> 01:59:34.507]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:34.587 --> 01:59:35.268]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:35.528 --> 01:59:36.108]  You want answers?
[01:59:55.493 --> 01:59:56.393]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:56.413 --> 02:00:01.015]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.255 --> 02:00:05.376]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.897 --> 02:00:09.077]  All right, my friends.
[02:00:09.137 --> 02:00:21.321]  We're now 30 seconds into this third hour, and we're about to go straight back to your calls and get into more news with our guest, Colonel
[02:00:23.018 --> 02:00:34.881]  Don DeGrand Prix and well going back two years ago he had a symposium outside DC that got picked up by the Portugal newspapers but not our newspapers of course.
[02:00:35.802 --> 02:00:46.865]  A 72 hour non-stop deliberation chaired by Colonel Don DeGrand Prix by a group of military and civilian US pilots under the chairmanship
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:52.783]  of our guests going over how the official story of 9-11 is a complete fraud.
[02:00:54.344 --> 02:00:56.345]  It'd be a joke if so many people weren't killed.
[02:00:57.565 --> 02:01:10.292]  So, Colonel, the militarization of police, the brainwashing of police, all this urban warfare training, the busting in the doors without the warrants, the Patriot Act,
[02:01:11.419 --> 02:01:16.381]  The cameras going up on the street corners, all part of this DARPA control grid.
[02:01:16.861 --> 02:01:17.882]  Can you speak to that?
[02:01:18.822 --> 02:01:19.542]  Yes, I can.
[02:01:19.583 --> 02:01:22.504]  I'm fairly familiar with DARPA and the way they operate.
[02:01:23.504 --> 02:01:26.205]  It is not military per se.
[02:01:27.326 --> 02:01:31.987]  It is scientific, and it's usually civilian-instigated.
[02:01:32.068 --> 02:01:36.529]  The policy formulation and whatnot are coming out of the civilian hierarchy.
[02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:40.471]  And to make a long story short,
[02:01:43.724 --> 02:01:47.405]  Somebody, sooner than later, is going to say, enough is enough.
[02:01:47.825 --> 02:01:51.886]  And it'll be a military guy, and when that happens, it's going to hit the fan.
[02:01:53.626 --> 02:02:00.087]  Okay, well, let's go ahead and go to John in New York, then Wayne, Diane, John, Scott, and others.
[02:02:00.267 --> 02:02:01.007]  Go ahead, John.
[02:02:02.068 --> 02:02:03.548]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:02:03.608 --> 02:02:04.528]  Terrific guest.
[02:02:05.568 --> 02:02:09.989]  I called in about a news article, very important.
[02:02:11.651 --> 02:02:16.652]  And after I give everybody information about that, I'd like to make a comment about 9-1-1.
[02:02:18.493 --> 02:02:36.737]  In the Rochester, New York, Democrat and Chronicle website, democratandchronicle, all one word, dot com, February 20, 2004, it's an article about substitute blood going to be used
[02:02:38.028 --> 02:02:42.209]  Without knowledge and without permission to the people that they're going to give it to them.
[02:02:42.289 --> 02:02:47.971]  Yeah, that was in the Chicago Tribune up at Loyola University.
[02:02:48.431 --> 02:02:52.513]  Now they say, we don't care if you don't want to have medical experiments done.
[02:02:52.733 --> 02:02:57.254]  When you come to the hospital, we're not going to tell you and we're just going to do this to you.
[02:02:57.274 --> 02:03:03.256]  I mean, that's an example of the level of just craziness with government pushing the envelope.
[02:03:04.496 --> 02:03:04.956]  Go ahead.
[02:03:05.317 --> 02:03:06.197]  Well, what people that
[02:03:07.581 --> 02:03:15.473]  Our concern about this is they should absolutely get a copy of this article from the Democrat and Chronicle website.
[02:03:16.634 --> 02:03:23.184]  They should call their state legislators and make a lot of noise about it, because I'm going to send it to my state senator.
[02:03:23.723 --> 02:03:25.444]  Well, that's like hospitals around here.
[02:03:25.704 --> 02:03:26.985]  You're not an organ donor.
[02:03:27.045 --> 02:03:28.425]  They still take your organs.
[02:03:29.006 --> 02:03:37.590]  I mean, Colonel, this is just... Why is government everywhere and private industry just engaging in so much wild criminal activity right now?
[02:03:37.890 --> 02:03:38.671]  It's fascism!
[02:03:39.991 --> 02:03:44.394]  Well, it is, but let me say this from a positive standpoint.
[02:03:45.314 --> 02:03:52.778]  I just came from an emergency where I had four units of blood plasma pumped into me.
[02:03:53.593 --> 02:04:02.538]  And I feel great, and this came from the University of Virginia cardiac bunch, and I'd go to hell and back for any of those guys.
[02:04:03.178 --> 02:04:04.979]  Well, certainly, I mean, it's like everything.
[02:04:04.999 --> 02:04:05.820]  There's good people.
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:09.902]  I'm talking, it's always the policy makers that are doing the bad things.
[02:04:10.042 --> 02:04:10.823]  That is correct.
[02:04:11.683 --> 02:04:12.544]  Yes, indeed.
[02:04:12.984 --> 02:04:20.428]  And too bad, but so many of these policy makers, and that's their exact title, policy operations.
[02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:24.452]  This is Paul Wolfowitz and his gang again.
[02:04:24.992 --> 02:04:31.997]  They're making policy in Defense Department to civilian hierarchy, which we call the neocons.
[02:04:32.837 --> 02:04:33.898]  And this is bad news.
[02:04:34.178 --> 02:04:36.700]  All right, caller, you had a question about 9-11?
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:37.080]  Yes.
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:41.062]  Okay, just ask it quick when we get back and we're going to move on to all these other callers.
[02:04:41.462 --> 02:04:42.143]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:04:44.637 --> 02:04:46.178]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:04:46.338 --> 02:04:47.459]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:04:47.639 --> 02:04:51.041]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:51.161 --> 02:04:51.581]  Phenol?
[02:04:51.901 --> 02:04:59.005]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:04:59.325 --> 02:05:03.447]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:05:03.547 --> 02:05:03.988]  Fragrance?
[02:05:04.368 --> 02:05:09.130]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:05:09.250 --> 02:05:13.873]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:16.715]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[02:05:16.975 --> 02:05:20.397]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[02:06:45.433 --> 02:06:52.818]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:06:53.098 --> 02:06:57.821]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:06:58.061 --> 02:07:03.705]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:07:03.945 --> 02:07:15.831]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:07:15.851 --> 02:07:20.394]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:07:20.554 --> 02:07:23.055]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:07:23.295 --> 02:07:30.019]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:07:36.203 --> 02:07:37.344]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:37.504 --> 02:07:38.304]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:38.365 --> 02:07:39.025]  You want answers?
[02:07:39.065 --> 02:07:39.986]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:57.273 --> 02:08:00.937]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:01.438 --> 02:08:05.562]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:12.650 --> 02:08:16.935]  Alright, eight minutes, thirty seconds into the third hour.
[02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:19.932]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:08:19.952 --> 02:08:26.638]  We'll have our guest with us for another 25 minutes or so, then I'm going to get into this big stack of news we have not detailed yet.
[02:08:26.678 --> 02:08:27.979]  Believe me, it's all very important.
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:30.382]  Our guest is Colonel Don DeGranpre.
[02:08:31.002 --> 02:08:33.705]  Honored to have him on the show.
[02:08:33.765 --> 02:08:39.831]  He's the author of the three-part series of books, Barbarians Inside the Gates.
[02:08:40.723 --> 02:08:44.144]  And, uh, real quick, John in New York, you had a question about 9-11.
[02:08:44.444 --> 02:08:47.025]  Uh, it's not a question, I want to make a comment.
[02:08:47.185 --> 02:08:53.607]  I was in the Air Force, my career field was radar operations, and I was assigned to the Air Defense Command.
[02:08:54.448 --> 02:09:04.331]  Uh, the airliners turned around at Erie, Pennsylvania, and were off course for approximately one hour at the wrong altitude, at the wrong speed,
[02:09:05.103 --> 02:09:15.390]  Without radio contact and it is absolutely insane for anybody to believe that could have happened unless people were told to stand down.
[02:09:18.268 --> 02:09:22.072]  In 18 minutes, had five F-16s around him in the middle of nowhere.
[02:09:22.092 --> 02:09:28.339]  He had the most sensitive air corridor in the world, the eastern coast there, D.C.
[02:09:28.399 --> 02:09:37.510]  New York, with these four planes all over the map, and they know there's been hijackings, and Dick Cheney's in control, and everything's standing down.
[02:09:39.256 --> 02:09:47.938]  The fighters that were stationed in Virginia, just across the border from Washington, D.C., could have been flying at buster speed, which is max speed.
[02:09:48.258 --> 02:09:53.239]  They could have intercepted those planes in 15 minutes and saved all that tragedy.
[02:09:53.579 --> 02:10:00.881]  And the second airplane was 15 minutes behind the first airplane, so to think that they didn't do anything about the second one makes it even more ludicrous.
[02:10:01.348 --> 02:10:04.870]  So, terrific guest, terrific show, thanks for taking my call.
[02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:09.433]  Alright, and again, we don't even do this justice to focus on one area.
[02:10:09.533 --> 02:10:18.418]  I mean, we've got all the public officials being told not to go to New York, the insider trading by the CIA, the Bushes protecting the Bin Ladens.
[02:10:18.498 --> 02:10:19.779]  Colonel, you want to comment on that?
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:28.705]  Well, what I was trying to get through here, John had done a beautiful job of laying it out here on 9-11.
[02:10:30.752 --> 02:10:39.078]  What I want to carry away is that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs himself has agreed there were no hijackers.
[02:10:39.499 --> 02:10:41.560]  There were no cell phone calls.
[02:10:42.161 --> 02:10:50.668]  Everybody aboard that aircraft, pilots and crew, were unconscious within 8 to 18 minutes after takeoff.
[02:10:51.388 --> 02:10:52.649]  And you can take it from there.
[02:10:52.769 --> 02:10:57.053]  I've got covered in books 2 and 3 what actually happened.
[02:10:57.603 --> 02:11:04.565]  So they're knocked out and then the remote control takes place and the rest is history.
[02:11:05.205 --> 02:11:10.286]  Yeah, there was a remote control and yes.
[02:11:11.707 --> 02:11:13.807]  By the way, people don't believe they have that.
[02:11:13.907 --> 02:11:23.070]  I mean, Kennedy's oldest son, JFK's big brother, died in a chase plane with a remote controlling in a
[02:11:24.386 --> 02:11:30.109]  A bomber loaded with explosives as a drone in 1944.
[02:11:30.349 --> 02:11:31.990]  That is correct.
[02:11:32.450 --> 02:11:34.912]  So, I mean, this is very old technology, folks.
[02:11:36.092 --> 02:11:38.574]  And for people that are in total denial, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:11:39.374 --> 02:11:43.436]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wayne in Virginia.
[02:11:43.876 --> 02:11:44.897]  Wayne, thanks for holding.
[02:11:44.917 --> 02:11:45.377]  Go ahead.
[02:11:45.597 --> 02:11:45.938]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:45.958 --> 02:11:46.558]  Thank you.
[02:11:46.778 --> 02:11:47.739]  I have a two-part question.
[02:11:47.779 --> 02:11:49.479]  The first part is, Colonel,
[02:11:51.266 --> 02:11:52.447]  John DeGramperie.
[02:11:52.467 --> 02:12:10.815]  DeGramperie, I'm sorry sir, I stumbled over your name there, but could you play the instructor with us, ground pounders, for a little while and tell us why, from an airmanship point of view, the maneuvers the aircraft performed were just inexplicable and bordering on the impossible from a pilot's point of view?
[02:12:12.916 --> 02:12:16.297]  Yes, let me give it real quick, Wayne, from Virginia.
[02:12:17.918 --> 02:12:20.059]  These planes were being piloted by
[02:12:20.603 --> 02:12:39.489]  Remote control probably an AWACS aircraft taking over that airplane or airplanes or drones unmanned drones and flying them at five and eight g-force that no pilot could withstand.
[02:12:40.649 --> 02:12:46.851]  So in short and if you read books two and three you will discover how and why this came about.
[02:12:46.871 --> 02:12:49.332]  The second part of my question is
[02:12:50.552 --> 02:13:10.678]  After 9-11, our congressman from down here, Randy Forbes, spoke at a Veterans Foreign Wars Hall about how close he was to the Bush and Rumsfeld cabal and how before 9-11 he had a briefing at the White House where they were told they were expecting something big from Afghanistan.
[02:13:10.698 --> 02:13:15.460]  And he also, in his discussion, there was about two or three hundred people there,
[02:13:16.311 --> 02:13:19.032]  It was recorded on film and my notes are very clear on this.
[02:13:19.072 --> 02:13:23.113]  He also said they were following other aircraft out over the ocean.
[02:13:23.153 --> 02:13:25.614]  Do you have any knowledge of that?
[02:13:25.634 --> 02:13:28.795]  Something I've not heard discussed at all about 9-11.
[02:13:29.615 --> 02:13:38.057]  No, but this comes under speculation now and I'm telling you that we are knowledgably speculating.
[02:13:38.597 --> 02:13:41.758]  Those aircraft carrying
[02:13:44.921 --> 02:13:50.171]  Crew and passengers went over the Atlantic and that was all she wrote.
[02:13:56.317 --> 02:14:01.240]  Yeah, you remote control the original planes out, then you're loaded up, drones attack.
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:12.547]  And the major, the biggest and oldest newspaper in Spain just came out three weeks ago, and they looked at the bottom of one of those jets, and there's some type of giant belly attachment.
[02:14:12.867 --> 02:14:15.409]  It is clearly a modified aircraft.
[02:14:15.429 --> 02:14:16.789]  Can I ask one final question?
[02:14:17.110 --> 02:14:17.350]  Yes.
[02:14:17.590 --> 02:14:21.712]  That your line of discussion here, Colonel, in the past few minutes has just opened up.
[02:14:21.752 --> 02:14:25.074]  You said earlier that you expected when push comes to shove that this 70%
[02:14:26.921 --> 02:14:29.482]  Of general and field grade officers, we're going to say that's it.
[02:14:30.282 --> 02:14:44.527]  Well, the enterprise that we're discussing here of taking loaded, regularly scheduled civilian airlines out and ditching them into the ocean and putting in their places aerial bombs... Yeah, that is push coming to shove.
[02:14:44.827 --> 02:14:45.627]  That is it.
[02:14:45.727 --> 02:14:46.968]  Why aren't these people...
[02:14:48.152 --> 02:14:49.293]  Coming forward now.
[02:14:49.373 --> 02:14:50.233]  Well, let me say this.
[02:14:50.453 --> 02:14:56.557]  We know, because, I mean, folks, I don't want to give too much detail out, but I've talked to them, lawyers have talked to them.
[02:14:57.417 --> 02:15:03.401]  We know hundreds of high-level officers have leaked everything we're now learning about today.
[02:15:04.281 --> 02:15:07.503]  So I think that this caught a lot of people unawares.
[02:15:08.364 --> 02:15:09.544]  Colonel, you want to comment on that?
[02:15:10.085 --> 02:15:17.149]  Well, the only thing I can say is that let's consider that second aircraft that hit the World Trade Center.
[02:15:18.282 --> 02:15:22.526]  It did have a control device on the belly, 757.
[02:15:24.369 --> 02:15:34.240]  That aircraft was unmanned and went in and blew up as a diversion and something else happened.
[02:15:34.864 --> 02:15:36.345]  This was a side show.
[02:15:36.805 --> 02:15:46.012]  I understand, but going back to when we know they had bombs in the buildings, that's now admitted, but going back to what the caller said, you're saying these elements of the military, when push comes to shove, are going to stand up.
[02:15:46.332 --> 02:15:50.475]  Well, I'd say 9-11 was the globalist pushing, so where's the shove?
[02:15:50.515 --> 02:15:51.256]  That's his question.
[02:15:52.477 --> 02:15:57.280]  This will come as is going to be in the form of a counter coup d'etat.
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:02.704]  You understand that a coup d'etat was pulled on September 11th by the civilian hierarchy.
[02:16:03.843 --> 02:16:05.424]  God grant that it would come soon, sir.
[02:16:06.825 --> 02:16:07.265]  Say again?
[02:16:07.906 --> 02:16:09.487]  God grant that it would come soon.
[02:16:10.107 --> 02:16:13.269]  Well, yes, it probably will.
[02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:15.191]  They're talking about going into Syria now.
[02:16:16.752 --> 02:16:17.292]  Don't believe it.
[02:16:18.653 --> 02:16:29.280]  There's a new ballgame there, and I can't go into it right now, but Syria is going to be something else entirely, involving NATO forces.
[02:16:30.681 --> 02:16:32.883]  And I can't go into that much right now.
[02:16:33.630 --> 02:16:34.190]  Okay.
[02:16:34.670 --> 02:16:36.571]  Thanks for the call, Wayne.
[02:16:37.031 --> 02:16:39.212]  Let's talk to Diane in South Carolina.
[02:16:39.272 --> 02:16:40.092]  Diane, go ahead.
[02:16:40.112 --> 02:16:40.652]  Hi.
[02:16:40.712 --> 02:16:50.274]  Before I ask my question, please ask Don DeGrampre, sir, to give us a phone number so we can contact him, and I have read the first book.
[02:16:50.514 --> 02:16:51.655]  It is awesome.
[02:16:51.955 --> 02:16:55.876]  It is like reading history and just watching everything unfold.
[02:16:55.896 --> 02:16:58.677]  Yeah, again, he wrote about it in 2000, and it happens a year later.
[02:16:58.697 --> 02:16:59.957]  Okay, here's my question.
[02:17:00.419 --> 02:17:08.667]  On Thursday of last week in the Post and Courier in South Carolina, they had a small article on the Russians who are now doing this World War III practice.
[02:17:09.588 --> 02:17:13.712]  Yeah, the Russians are doing nuclear attack drills on us, our little buddies, you know.
[02:17:13.732 --> 02:17:17.917]  Okay, they had in there about a maneuverable, nuclear-tipped weapon
[02:17:18.733 --> 02:17:22.157]  Yeah, they're saying they've got a missile that nothing can stop.
[02:17:37.461 --> 02:17:38.381]  It's probably going.
[02:17:38.401 --> 02:17:39.242]  I can't give you detail.
[02:17:39.262 --> 02:17:41.302]  We're bordering on certain elements that I can't talk about.
[02:18:04.193 --> 02:18:13.119]  We have to consider the Russian aspect of these weapons as being, in essence, propaganda.
[02:18:13.899 --> 02:18:23.325]  We have the same type of unmanned aircraft, drones, etc., that can fly five times the speed of sound.
[02:18:23.345 --> 02:18:25.227]  We'll do a lot more than that.
[02:18:25.247 --> 02:18:30.090]  Yeah, but Diane, let's not worry too much about the Russians.
[02:18:30.546 --> 02:18:34.367]  Well, is that that non-gravitational type airplane or something?
[02:18:34.387 --> 02:18:36.127]  No, they've got regular propulsion aircraft.
[02:18:36.267 --> 02:18:37.507]  Look, look, look, ma'am.
[02:18:37.888 --> 02:18:45.109]  They claim the SR-71 Blackbird, in flight and 55, in service and 59, is the fastest jet in the world.
[02:18:45.189 --> 02:18:47.309]  It is not the... and it cruises at Mach 3.
[02:18:48.350 --> 02:18:48.730]  Okay?
[02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:54.271]  I mean, they got jets that'll just... Well, I know we're way behind what they're telling us, but what I'm... Yeah, Carla, you want to comment on that?
[02:18:56.411 --> 02:18:59.632]  Uh... And ask him to give out his number for us, too.
[02:19:00.419 --> 02:19:07.801]  Let me give you a home phone where you can contact me, Grand Prairie Publishing Limited at 540-547-2996.
[02:19:19.471 --> 02:19:20.591]  And that's my home phone.
[02:19:20.651 --> 02:19:23.452]  It's a private phone, and you can call me anytime.
[02:19:23.872 --> 02:19:29.634]  Okay, now we know that you had a stroke a few years ago worrying about this so much, so folks, don't bug him too much.
[02:19:30.254 --> 02:19:33.735]  Hey, I feel like I'm going to have one every day worrying about this.
[02:19:34.355 --> 02:19:39.596]  I can handle just about everything, including this 15-year-old building that I was riding this morning.
[02:19:39.996 --> 02:19:41.317]  Okay, well that's good, sir.
[02:19:41.717 --> 02:19:42.357]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:42.397 --> 02:19:43.277]  We'll take more calls.
[02:19:45.018 --> 02:19:46.438]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:19:46.992 --> 02:19:51.294]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:19:51.695 --> 02:19:52.555]  It still is!
[02:19:53.175 --> 02:19:56.677]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:19:56.997 --> 02:19:58.798]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:19:59.379 --> 02:20:01.440]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:20:01.980 --> 02:20:04.001]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:20:04.402 --> 02:20:12.026]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:20:12.426 --> 02:20:16.168]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.
[02:20:16.866 --> 02:20:21.831]  Call this toll-free number for your free investing in Precious Metals Kit.
[02:20:22.131 --> 02:20:24.573]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[02:20:38.926 --> 02:20:39.586]  Call today, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:46.218 --> 02:20:46.558]  I think so.
[02:21:01.463 --> 02:21:02.123]  We're good to go!
[02:21:30.999 --> 02:21:34.083]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:21:34.244 --> 02:21:40.112]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:21:43.792 --> 02:21:51.297]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:21:51.577 --> 02:22:04.565]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:22:04.845 --> 02:22:08.147]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:22:08.507 --> 02:22:18.955]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:22:19.255 --> 02:22:19.756]  That's right!
[02:22:19.936 --> 02:22:27.041]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:22:27.341 --> 02:22:33.486]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10.
[02:22:34.667 --> 02:22:38.852]  Calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:22:39.012 --> 02:22:43.757]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:22:44.197 --> 02:22:47.781]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[02:22:48.041 --> 02:22:49.463]  If so, hope has arrived.
[02:22:49.943 --> 02:22:51.385]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[02:22:51.645 --> 02:22:56.771]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[02:22:57.171 --> 02:23:01.616]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[02:23:01.956 --> 02:23:10.646]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[02:23:11.106 --> 02:23:12.228]  Gum disease is serious!
[02:23:12.708 --> 02:23:16.471]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[02:23:16.751 --> 02:23:23.375]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[02:23:23.715 --> 02:23:27.758]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[02:23:44.378 --> 02:23:50.424]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:51.886 --> 02:23:53.167]  Alright, folks, here's the deal.
[02:23:53.187 --> 02:23:57.752]  We're gonna take five more calls from our guests, then I'm gonna let our guests go.
[02:23:57.792 --> 02:24:01.776]  I really appreciate them coming on, and I'm gonna cover a bunch of news that we haven't really detailed yet.
[02:24:02.337 --> 02:24:05.280]  It's very, very important, and recap some top stories as well.
[02:24:07.033 --> 02:24:10.155]  Diane had asked for your phone number, and if you want to give it out, that's fine.
[02:24:10.175 --> 02:24:12.216]  Folks, I want to talk to the Colonel.
[02:24:12.797 --> 02:24:16.179]  It's 540-547-2996.
[02:24:18.241 --> 02:24:24.285]  And before he leaves us in the next segment, we'll give you the mailing address again to get the books.
[02:24:24.385 --> 02:24:27.567]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:24:28.088 --> 02:24:29.089]  John, you're on the air.
[02:24:29.149 --> 02:24:29.629]  Go ahead.
[02:24:30.149 --> 02:24:35.093]  Colonel, did a cruise missile hit the Pentagon, or a Global Hawk, or a drone business jet?
[02:24:37.260 --> 02:24:39.901]  You're talking about what hit the Pentagon, right John?
[02:24:41.782 --> 02:24:44.003]  It was a cruise missile.
[02:24:44.383 --> 02:24:47.124]  It could have been a Global Hawk.
[02:24:47.604 --> 02:24:48.545]  It was not.
[02:24:49.531 --> 02:24:50.652]  A commercial aircraft.
[02:24:51.072 --> 02:24:54.734]  And that's what the eyewitnesses said, and the evidence shows.
[02:24:55.274 --> 02:24:58.336]  And do people realize this was staged at the Pentagon?
[02:24:58.356 --> 02:25:02.938]  I mean, obviously the area that's under renovation, and then all this happens.
[02:25:02.978 --> 02:25:06.741]  Do people at the Pentagon, are they still buying the official story, Colonel?
[02:25:07.741 --> 02:25:13.664]  Well, I can't speak for the rest of them, but I'm certainly not buying that.
[02:25:13.724 --> 02:25:16.406]  And I think I've got the full story in Book 3.
[02:25:19.877 --> 02:25:20.357]  That's it.
[02:25:20.477 --> 02:25:25.799]  It was a diversionary hit for strategic reasons.
[02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:32.802]  And it didn't matter whether it was a pilotless drone or a Global Hawk missile.
[02:25:35.123 --> 02:25:36.604]  It wasn't a commercial aircraft.
[02:25:36.744 --> 02:25:42.466]  It's the most surveilled area in the world, but no video of it, and witnesses said they saw a small aircraft.
[02:25:43.846 --> 02:25:44.867]  No, they did not.
[02:25:45.787 --> 02:25:47.548]  We saw segments of a
[02:25:49.767 --> 02:26:05.235]  A video that purported to show a firing of a launch, probably from a Global Hawk or an unmanned aircraft missile, but it certainly wasn't a commercial aircraft.
[02:26:05.415 --> 02:26:06.715]  Was that what was supposed to hit the Pentagon?
[02:26:06.735 --> 02:26:07.976]  No, that was hit at ten hundred hours.
[02:26:18.283 --> 02:26:22.426]  It was taken out by the North Dakota Air Guard.
[02:26:22.446 --> 02:26:29.030]  I know the pilot who fired those two missiles that took down 93.
[02:26:29.411 --> 02:26:37.756]  Was it shot down because the airline pilots actually regained control of the hijacked autopilot or was that the replacement unmanned drone that was shot down?
[02:26:38.156 --> 02:26:39.557]  No.
[02:26:40.678 --> 02:26:46.442]  The aircraft you see had totally unconscious people on board.
[02:26:46.502 --> 02:26:47.863]  There were no hijackers.
[02:26:48.944 --> 02:27:04.036]  At 935, the Happy Hooligans, the air guard flying F-16s, were ordered to take that plane out, and they took it out from 935 to 10 o'clock.
[02:27:04.397 --> 02:27:06.698]  Were there any refueling jets involved in that operation?
[02:27:06.719 --> 02:27:08.660]  But the question is, hold on a second, John.
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:12.543]  The question is, why did they deviate from the plan of flying it into the capital?
[02:27:12.963 --> 02:27:16.046]  Why did the globalists decide to go ahead and shoot the plane down?
[02:27:18.691 --> 02:27:38.603]  There had been an adjustment to the controls, probably by an AWACS aircraft flying overhead again, remote control, and it was on a course for either the Capitol or the White House, and at this stage you don't know.
[02:27:39.363 --> 02:27:41.825]  The happy hooligans came in and took care of it.
[02:27:42.645 --> 02:27:44.866]  Do you think they were not following orders?
[02:27:46.527 --> 02:27:47.428]  The happy hooligans?
[02:27:47.819 --> 02:27:51.445]  Well, yeah, I mean, we've got Cheney running around, we've got the stand-down taking place.
[02:27:51.465 --> 02:27:59.359]  Well, this is correct, but you see, the Adjutant General of the State of North Dakota gave the command to take it out.
[02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:01.743]  And by God, they took it out.
[02:28:02.322 --> 02:28:04.864]  And I've got the full story in the book.
[02:28:05.084 --> 02:28:06.385]  That's a good thing they did that.
[02:28:06.425 --> 02:28:07.606]  You say you've talked to the pilot.
[02:28:07.987 --> 02:28:09.368]  You know, think about this, folks.
[02:28:09.928 --> 02:28:14.712]  Imagine what Bush would have gotten if he would have had that plane flying to the Capitol.
[02:28:15.052 --> 02:28:17.214]  Imagine the police state we'd be in right now.
[02:28:17.575 --> 02:28:19.216]  Yes, yes, yes indeed.
[02:28:21.818 --> 02:28:29.064]  And so you have to have the diversionary blast at the Pentagon, so the Pentagon, so no one would get suspicious and think it was a military coup.
[02:28:30.345 --> 02:28:31.606]  Oh look, we got a tattoo.
[02:28:33.499 --> 02:28:33.939]  Perhaps.
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:36.101]  John, does that answer your question?
[02:28:37.281 --> 02:28:42.004]  Were there any refueling tankers used by the North Dakota Air Guard, and what tanker wing was used?
[02:28:43.425 --> 02:28:47.327]  I don't know about the aircraft itself.
[02:28:47.367 --> 02:28:48.688]  I don't know about refueling.
[02:28:49.048 --> 02:28:58.694]  They came off base from Langley, and it was just a few minutes out from Langley to the intercept over Pennsylvania.
[02:28:59.594 --> 02:29:00.855]  Just a matter of minutes.
[02:29:03.420 --> 02:29:05.941]  How did you get in touch with the pilot who shot the plane down?
[02:29:09.382 --> 02:29:29.367]  It turned out to be an old friend of mine from the Air National Guard and this is my home state of North Dakota and I attended a ceremony Governor of North Dakota plus the Adjutant General plus the pilots being decorated a year later for this activity over
[02:29:30.526 --> 02:29:33.007]  That happened on 9-11 with Flight 93.
[02:29:34.928 --> 02:29:35.869]  We're on the march.
[02:29:36.329 --> 02:29:37.950]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:38.850 --> 02:29:41.651]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.193 --> 02:29:47.974]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[02:29:48.474 --> 02:29:51.896]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:29:52.396 --> 02:29:53.097]  Let's update.
[02:29:53.577 --> 02:29:57.018]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:29:58.939 --> 02:30:01.400]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:30:02.080 --> 02:30:03.021]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:30:03.061 --> 02:30:05.361]  dollar was worth 17% more than the euro.
[02:30:05.902 --> 02:30:06.802]  Today, the U.S.
[02:30:06.842 --> 02:30:09.063]  dollar is worth 28% less than the euro.
[02:30:09.463 --> 02:30:10.984]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:30:11.564 --> 02:30:13.545]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[02:30:14.905 --> 02:30:19.767]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:30:20.767 --> 02:30:21.508]  Gold is moving.
[02:30:21.768 --> 02:30:22.908]  Equities are treading water.
[02:30:23.328 --> 02:30:25.989]  They say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:30:26.529 --> 02:30:27.850]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:30:28.325 --> 02:30:30.027]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:30:30.447 --> 02:30:32.409]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[02:31:45.861 --> 02:31:47.262]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[02:31:47.602 --> 02:31:48.722]  Is your hair looking thinner?

[02:33:04.801 --> 02:33:05.942]  Welcome back.
[02:33:05.982 --> 02:33:20.337]  We're about to go back to the Colonel and his amazing revelation of the North Dakota National Guard that had been moved to Langley, Virginia a few months before 9-11 and then went in there and shot down that Flight 93 over Pennsylvania.
[02:33:26.101 --> 02:33:27.243]  Says he's talked to the pilot.
[02:33:28.344 --> 02:33:29.766]  And his info checks out.
[02:33:29.806 --> 02:33:31.569]  I've been researching what he's been doing for years.
[02:33:32.350 --> 02:33:40.522]  Before we go back to our guests and four final calls from Scott and June and Warren and Greg, we're going to go to you quick, too, because I've got a bunch of news I need to get to.
[02:33:41.223 --> 02:33:54.688]  Before I do that, to police state 3 total enslavement, an Alex Jones film, the greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us, a scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn to enslave every man, woman, and child.
[02:33:55.208 --> 02:34:01.110]  The United States government at all levels has fallen under the control of the desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:12.555]  The events of September 11th marked the initiation of the final sick push of the Illuminati to consolidate their One World Order and transform Earth into a prison planet.
[02:34:13.836 --> 02:34:26.942]  In over two and a half hours, I chronicle in stunning detail the true character of the Globalist, learn the master plan of the bloodthirsty elite to financially, physically, and spiritually imprison not only America, but the world.
[02:34:27.668 --> 02:34:34.291]  Total Enslavement is the third installment in my critically acclaimed Police State series, and is a must-see for all who love freedom.
[02:34:34.711 --> 02:34:47.017]  The film documents the nightmare rise of the Homeland Security Dictatorship, Patriot Act I and II, the Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison surveillance economy, and much more.
[02:34:47.557 --> 02:34:56.341]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism, and how the globalists pose as our saviors, when in fact they are the terrorists.
[02:34:57.907 --> 02:35:00.471]  Now, that's one of my 10 videos.
[02:35:00.551 --> 02:35:01.552]  They're all amazing.
[02:35:01.592 --> 02:35:01.732]  They're $25.95.
[02:35:01.773 --> 02:35:03.335]  That video is 2 hours and 44 minutes long.
[02:35:03.355 --> 02:35:04.697]  Really, it's 3 or 4 films in one.
[02:35:08.931 --> 02:35:14.936]  Twenty bucks when you order three or more, and your support of this show is needed, my friends.
[02:35:15.476 --> 02:35:19.159]  So get the video, spread the word, get my book, get the books we carry.
[02:35:19.659 --> 02:35:26.264]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:47.063]  That's 888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones, and I'm at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:35:47.823 --> 02:35:49.645]  Take action.
[02:35:50.246 --> 02:35:51.327]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:35:51.887 --> 02:35:55.631]  You know when you support this show, you're certainly helping get the word out as well.
[02:35:56.491 --> 02:35:58.513]  Colonel, before we take these four final calls,
[02:35:59.930 --> 02:36:02.192]  Go over that a little bit slower for folks.
[02:36:02.553 --> 02:36:03.313]  That's a big deal.
[02:36:03.353 --> 02:36:10.440]  You've talked to the pilot, a friend of yours, who shot down Flight 93 that was going for the Capitol or the White House.
[02:36:12.702 --> 02:36:14.043]  Go over that for folks.
[02:36:14.764 --> 02:36:17.466]  Okay, quick rundown.
[02:36:18.026 --> 02:36:21.490]  They were out of Hector Field, Fargo, North Dakota.
[02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:24.092]  It's the 119th Fighter Group.
[02:36:27.330 --> 02:36:28.991]  And they're called the Happy Hooligans.
[02:36:29.091 --> 02:36:33.472]  They're probably the best interceptors that we have in the country.
[02:36:34.032 --> 02:36:39.774]  They were moved to Langley Air Force Base from Hector Field down to Southern Virginia.
[02:36:40.515 --> 02:36:51.778]  And when the klaxon horn went off at 935, those three pilots all put down their coffee and shot into their aircraft and took off.
[02:36:52.539 --> 02:36:56.680]  They didn't know where they were going initially, but by ten hundred hours,
[02:36:57.426 --> 02:37:11.732]  They had rendezvoused over Southern Pennsylvania, that's about 250 miles in just a matter of minutes, and engaged 93 with two Sidewinder missiles.
[02:37:12.913 --> 02:37:14.573]  And they accomplished their objective.
[02:37:15.113 --> 02:37:19.315]  Now Hector Field, I used to fly out of Hector Field some time ago.
[02:37:19.495 --> 02:37:21.056]  I know most of those pilots.
[02:37:21.816 --> 02:37:23.137]  I could name names.
[02:37:24.878 --> 02:37:25.398]  I know the
[02:37:26.687 --> 02:37:36.991]  The National Guard Adjutant General, and they were decorated about a year later, and I have the full write-up of that story in my book.
[02:37:37.731 --> 02:37:40.892]  Yeah, and it's just ignored by the media.
[02:37:40.992 --> 02:37:52.797]  I have that article too, and you know, later, well, okay, it was a missile, and well, there wasn't a, you know, let's roll, just all made-up theater for the public, and we buy it like a bunch of saps.
[02:37:53.077 --> 02:37:53.997]  That is correct.
[02:37:54.158 --> 02:37:54.838]  It's incredible.
[02:37:56.148 --> 02:37:59.970]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Florida.
[02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.710]  Scott, go ahead.
[02:38:00.730 --> 02:38:02.151]  Hi, how are you doing?
[02:38:02.371 --> 02:38:02.671]  Fine.
[02:38:02.911 --> 02:38:03.231]  Scott?
[02:38:03.652 --> 02:38:03.852]  Hi.
[02:38:03.952 --> 02:38:09.674]  Early in the show you mentioned that both Chaney and Wolfowitz might be in some trouble.
[02:38:10.335 --> 02:38:21.680]  I was wondering if they've been serving the real rulers of the world, the 13 families or whoever they are, and been dutifully pushing the
[02:38:22.418 --> 02:38:30.323]  Yeah, obviously they're just minion administrator policy wonk puppets.
[02:38:31.464 --> 02:38:33.466]  They've been doing a good job for them.
[02:38:33.746 --> 02:38:40.530]  Why are they in danger versus Powell or Rice or Bush or are they all in danger?
[02:38:40.591 --> 02:38:41.691]  Or David Rockefeller.
[02:38:41.971 --> 02:38:42.192]  Right.
[02:38:43.993 --> 02:38:46.595]  Cheney is closest to the act of action.
[02:38:47.195 --> 02:38:49.917]  He was probably most involved
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:55.883]  In all of the details of September 11th, and he'll be one of the first to fall.
[02:38:56.764 --> 02:38:58.565]  So I predict... Because he knows?
[02:38:59.726 --> 02:39:04.829]  I predict that Cheney will be out of here and inside well prior to the election.
[02:39:05.870 --> 02:39:11.533]  Because he knows exactly what happened or because... Yes, he knows exactly what happened and he is toast.
[02:39:11.553 --> 02:39:14.315]  And they have to eliminate all those people?
[02:39:16.376 --> 02:39:17.357]  Several, yes.
[02:39:20.206 --> 02:39:24.987]  Weren't they served as a warning to anybody who would serve them in the future?
[02:39:26.448 --> 02:39:33.229]  Perhaps, but these guys can only understand one ingredient and that is force.
[02:39:34.609 --> 02:39:37.470]  And that force has to emanate from the military.
[02:39:37.490 --> 02:39:45.312]  And the military force in the persona of military tribunals will take over.
[02:39:46.343 --> 02:39:49.125]  And Cheney, as I reiterate, is toast.
[02:39:49.426 --> 02:39:51.427]  But they're the ones creating the tribunals.
[02:39:52.488 --> 02:40:06.099]  Now, I will say this, General Rick Baucus, over a year ago, Rhode Island native, the head of Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay, he resigned and said, I'm not going to torture innocent people.
[02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:08.461]  Now, that hardly got any press.
[02:40:08.501 --> 02:40:10.823]  We have two-star generals quitting.
[02:40:11.364 --> 02:40:14.186]  We have a lot of people not going along with this already.
[02:40:15.663 --> 02:40:17.084]  There will be a lot more, Alex.
[02:40:17.104 --> 02:40:18.164]  Pardon me?
[02:40:18.584 --> 02:40:20.345]  There will be a lot more.
[02:40:22.006 --> 02:40:25.328]  People either resigning or retiring.
[02:40:26.348 --> 02:40:39.314]  And yet it's going to come out and there will be military tribunal... Well, also the Pentagon just came out and said that Halliburton's been stealing and is going to do a criminal investigation.
[02:40:40.115 --> 02:40:43.577]  We'll see what happens with that, but thanks for the call, Scott.
[02:40:44.217 --> 02:40:45.518]  June, in mass.
[02:40:45.778 --> 02:40:46.599]  June, you're on the air.
[02:40:46.639 --> 02:40:47.019]  Go ahead.
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:48.700]  Hi.
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:41:01.607]  I hope you're not going to be offended, but you know, I'm really suspicious of that stroke because a lot of us don't trust the pharmaceutical companies or the medical business.
[02:41:01.847 --> 02:41:03.628]  Well, I'm really confused what you're talking about.
[02:41:03.648 --> 02:41:05.929]  Well, the colonel had a stroke.
[02:41:06.857 --> 02:41:08.597]  So, I mean, is he?
[02:41:08.777 --> 02:41:13.758]  I mean, it wasn't like anything quite... Oh yeah, I mean, while he was busy exposing all this, he had a stroke.
[02:41:14.238 --> 02:41:15.979]  Well, you know, strokes happen because of stress.
[02:41:15.999 --> 02:41:17.119]  You want to comment, Colonel?
[02:41:17.859 --> 02:41:22.620]  Well, things happened, June, and with me it was a stroke.
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:26.801]  Right carotid artery blocked entirely, and I was out.
[02:41:28.641 --> 02:41:31.841]  I'm now fully recovered, and I'm very active.
[02:41:31.921 --> 02:41:34.722]  In fact, my wife says I'm hyperactive.
[02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:43.086]  Well, many medications can cause a stroke, so I hope you'll look into, you know, maybe call Dr. McCain.
[02:41:43.106 --> 02:41:44.107]  She's a sponsor.
[02:41:44.127 --> 02:41:47.489]  Okay, June, anything on your mind concerning September 11th?
[02:41:47.850 --> 02:41:50.312]  No, but I'm just concerned about his health.
[02:41:51.092 --> 02:41:55.175]  Health is fine, June, and I appreciate your interest.
[02:41:55.276 --> 02:41:56.076]  I'm doing great.
[02:41:56.396 --> 02:41:59.279]  Don't smoke and don't eat too many fried foods.
[02:41:59.299 --> 02:42:00.880]  I probably sound like your wife.
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:03.002]  I don't think he smokes, so...
[02:42:04.033 --> 02:42:04.493]  Okay.
[02:42:04.673 --> 02:42:05.434]  Thank you, June.
[02:42:06.735 --> 02:42:08.516]  Let's talk to Warren in Colorado.
[02:42:08.536 --> 02:42:09.417]  Warren, go ahead.
[02:42:09.877 --> 02:42:10.597]  Oh, hi.
[02:42:11.278 --> 02:42:12.759]  Just incredible information.
[02:42:13.319 --> 02:42:15.461]  I think this is breaking news, at least for me.
[02:42:15.481 --> 02:42:26.148]  I'm probably the fourth caller familiar with aviation, and we could go into how someone could actually fly planes into a building.
[02:42:28.009 --> 02:42:31.211]  I just wanted to call and thank you, Alex, for
[02:42:31.874 --> 02:42:32.554]  Working pretty hard.
[02:42:32.594 --> 02:42:35.315]  I heard you on KOA at 3.30 when I was checking cattle.
[02:42:37.676 --> 02:42:43.117]  I look forward to the rebroadcast and purchasing some books and videos and so on.
[02:42:43.477 --> 02:42:45.098]  Yeah, I was up until 5 a.m.
[02:42:45.158 --> 02:42:47.958]  Central on KOA.
[02:42:47.998 --> 02:42:50.419]  I was on there three hours on Rick Barber's show.
[02:42:50.479 --> 02:42:53.660]  I'm going to be up tonight doing interviews.
[02:42:54.120 --> 02:42:57.381]  Hey, we don't sleep around here and fight against the New World Order.
[02:42:58.061 --> 02:42:58.541]  Okay, thanks.
[02:42:59.101 --> 02:43:01.302]  Alright, because if we don't win this, it's all over.
[02:43:01.909 --> 02:43:03.870]  I mean, really, this is for all the marbles.
[02:43:03.910 --> 02:43:04.670]  These people are evil.
[02:43:05.511 --> 02:43:07.231]  Thank you for the call, Warren.
[02:43:08.032 --> 02:43:09.912]  Let's talk to Greg in Alabama.
[02:43:09.972 --> 02:43:10.633]  Last caller.
[02:43:10.693 --> 02:43:11.393]  Greg, go ahead.
[02:43:11.773 --> 02:43:12.914]  Alex, God bless you.
[02:43:13.854 --> 02:43:19.516]  God bless your wife for being there behind you and making sure that you're continuing to do this for this country.
[02:43:19.576 --> 02:43:20.317]  Yeah, she's great.
[02:43:21.397 --> 02:43:23.978]  I can't even say anything enough about her and I don't even know the woman.
[02:43:26.164 --> 02:43:33.646]  I just want to point out a couple things, and I hope you don't treat me the way that people treat you when you try to bring this stuff to the forefront.
[02:43:33.966 --> 02:43:34.707]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:43:35.227 --> 02:43:37.007]  This is very, very important.
[02:43:37.067 --> 02:43:38.388]  As you can tell, I'm shaking.
[02:43:39.248 --> 02:43:40.608]  I finally get through to talk to you.
[02:43:41.349 --> 02:43:45.710]  On your videos, everything is true.
[02:43:45.730 --> 02:43:46.590]  I don't have to tell you.
[02:43:46.650 --> 02:43:47.390]  You already know.
[02:43:47.410 --> 02:43:51.031]  As soon as you see the truth in front of you, it is already evident.
[02:43:51.111 --> 02:43:52.872]  The explanations and the excuses,
[02:43:53.325 --> 02:44:09.656]  that are given to you before that, they just disappear because you, everybody knows deep inside that there is something wrong, that there is an evil power somewhere, and through all the definitions from movies, books, people get everything so confused and you're able to bring it all to the forefront and just lay it out.
[02:44:11.178 --> 02:44:20.184]  You mentioned Malak several times, the Babylonian, the eye on the pyramid, which you mentioned several times in the video.
[02:44:20.985 --> 02:44:22.946]  You're talking about Police State 3?
[02:44:23.447 --> 02:44:28.370]  Yeah, I just watched Police State 3 for the first time after I bought six of your videos.
[02:44:28.590 --> 02:44:30.091]  Thank you.
[02:44:30.231 --> 02:44:31.932]  I will support you until I die.
[02:44:32.412 --> 02:44:36.495]  I will be there for you no matter what.
[02:44:38.056 --> 02:44:48.262]  What I need for your listeners to hear is every night when I listen to your radio show or when I'm sitting here at work listening to it and I'm taking all the grief from the people that I work with, I don't care.
[02:44:49.222 --> 02:45:01.484]  There's a certain knowledge that was known in the beginning of our beginning of time, which is this cycle of our system that we're in now, this last 3,000 or 10,000 years, whatever it was the beginning.
[02:45:02.044 --> 02:45:17.107]  The ancient Egyptians, which were not called the ancient Egyptians, were that the pyramids, all that comes from, all that understanding that that comes from, there was a pure understanding before the Europeans came in and took over those nations.
[02:45:17.651 --> 02:45:20.912]  And then told everybody else what they were about.
[02:45:21.152 --> 02:45:29.894]  Well, I will say this, yeah, the Illuminati got a lot of the secret knowledge, information, suppressed it, and that's what a lot of this is about today.
[02:45:29.914 --> 02:45:38.675]  And that's why the globalist symbol is the all-seeing eye and the pyramid, is they're laughing at us, saying, we've got the secret knowledge, you profane idiots don't know anything.
[02:45:39.155 --> 02:45:40.376]  You want to comment on this, Colonel?
[02:45:40.396 --> 02:45:42.696]  Can I just finish something really quick?
[02:45:42.736 --> 02:45:43.116]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:45:43.396 --> 02:45:45.717]  I don't mean to disrespect either of you, you guys are great people.
[02:45:45.737 --> 02:45:46.697]  That's okay, go ahead.
[02:45:47.133 --> 02:45:53.775]  The thing is, is that just like with everything you say, once you say it, and once you hear it, you just automatically know it.
[02:45:53.795 --> 02:45:57.977]  If you need to go look into it any further and check it out and verify it for yourself, that's fine.
[02:45:58.437 --> 02:46:03.499]  There are two authors that I'm aware of right now that I know there's more, just like there's more people like you.
[02:46:03.699 --> 02:46:05.640]  One, his name is Mustafa Gadalla.
[02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:07.360]  He is a native Egyptian.
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:10.782]  And the other, his name is Rahun Nefer Amen.
[02:46:10.922 --> 02:46:14.783]  He is the author of the Metu Neture, which he wrote in trance.
[02:46:15.307 --> 02:46:18.668]  Connecting to the one true source.
[02:46:18.708 --> 02:46:21.570]  I just deal with facts and documents and stuff I can prove.
[02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:23.611]  Just send me the info.
[02:46:23.691 --> 02:46:24.391]  I'll tell you what.
[02:46:24.411 --> 02:46:25.251]  Just send me the info.
[02:46:25.591 --> 02:46:30.534]  Unfortunately, I took way more calls than I was going to and I kept our guests too long.
[02:46:30.554 --> 02:46:32.254]  I've got a few news articles here I want to hit.
[02:46:32.794 --> 02:46:36.176]  But send me some info and maybe I'll have them on for a guest or something.
[02:46:36.256 --> 02:46:37.577]  Five more seconds please, Alex.
[02:46:37.937 --> 02:46:38.957]  Five more seconds, go ahead.

[02:46:58.540 --> 02:47:02.783]  The names and the people and the cults and all that stuff, it's just the understanding.
[02:47:03.043 --> 02:47:03.883]  Okay, okay.
[02:47:04.503 --> 02:47:05.264]  Listen, I'll check it out.
[02:47:05.324 --> 02:47:05.684]  Thank you.

[02:47:07.345 --> 02:47:10.006]  Colonel, I really want to appreciate you.
[02:47:10.167 --> 02:47:11.167]  I mean, I really do appreciate you.
[02:47:11.187 --> 02:47:14.709]  I want to thank you, Colonel Don DeGrand Prix, for coming on the show.
[02:47:14.909 --> 02:47:16.530]  And if folks want to get your three books,

[02:47:38.106 --> 02:47:39.567]  The first two books are $30.
[02:47:39.627 --> 02:47:42.470]  The new one's $45 because of your printing cost.
[02:47:42.590 --> 02:47:44.831]  I really appreciate you coming on, my friend.
[02:47:44.851 --> 02:47:47.413]  It's a pleasure, Alex.
[02:47:48.744 --> 02:47:50.724]  Keep up your damn good work.
[02:47:51.004 --> 02:47:53.205]  You're doing marvelously well, Alex.
[02:47:53.745 --> 02:47:54.165]  Keep it up.
[02:47:54.565 --> 02:47:55.165]  Well, absolutely.
[02:47:55.205 --> 02:47:59.546]  We'll have to have you back on the show, and God bless you.
[02:48:00.066 --> 02:48:00.606]  Thank you, sir.
[02:48:00.946 --> 02:48:01.306]  You bet.
[02:48:01.346 --> 02:48:01.946]  Take care.
[02:48:02.206 --> 02:48:02.987]  I did it again.
[02:48:03.087 --> 02:48:03.687]  Great guest.
[02:48:03.767 --> 02:48:08.167]  Ended up having him on for an hour and 48 minutes, and I didn't get to Stacks of News.
[02:48:08.348 --> 02:48:10.288]  I mean, just Stacks of News here.
[02:48:11.108 --> 02:48:11.828]  I mentioned it.
[02:48:12.088 --> 02:48:13.248]  I mean, I mentioned it.
[02:48:13.308 --> 02:48:15.729]  Soldiers given five bullets for Iraq War.
[02:48:15.789 --> 02:48:16.509]  That's the Herald.
[02:48:18.063 --> 02:48:18.884]  To the dark troops.
[02:48:19.324 --> 02:48:20.225]  I got stuff like that.
[02:48:20.705 --> 02:48:25.408]  A report, Slavery Alive and Well in U.S., Tallahassee, Florida, Newsday.
[02:48:25.969 --> 02:48:28.230]  Modern day slavery is alive and well in Florida.
[02:48:28.270 --> 02:48:37.296]  The head of Human Rights Center said Tuesday, and it released a report on people forced to work as prostitutes, farm workers, and maids across the state.
[02:48:38.036 --> 02:48:39.557]  It's real bad in Texas, too.
[02:48:40.458 --> 02:48:41.278]  Human traffickers.
[02:48:41.959 --> 02:48:43.600]  That's what these open borders are about, folks.
[02:48:43.620 --> 02:48:45.221]  It's about oppression of the people.
[02:48:46.020 --> 02:49:00.411]  Human traffickers bring thousands of people into the United States each year, and Florida is believed to be one of the top three destinations, along with New York, Texas, according to the Center for the Advancement of Human Rights at Florida State University.
[02:49:01.591 --> 02:49:10.438]  Although there have been several prosecutions of human trafficking in Florida, no one knows how many people in Florida are under the control of traffickers, said Terry Coonan, the Center's Executive Director.
[02:49:10.718 --> 02:49:11.919]  I'm going to get him on
[02:49:12.771 --> 02:49:13.971]  And then I got this article.
[02:49:14.531 --> 02:49:18.052]  Azerbaijan probes child organ trafficking.
[02:49:19.212 --> 02:49:30.355]  BBC, the Azerbaijan government, says it is keen to crack down on child traffickers who are believed to be taking children abroad and selling their organs for profit.
[02:49:30.835 --> 02:49:33.495]  And it shows a bag of ice with a baby's organs in it.
[02:49:33.535 --> 02:49:35.976]  I mean, who could kidnap a child and cut their guts out?
[02:49:36.937 --> 02:49:39.779]  Man, you people are going to hell, and I am very happy.
[02:49:41.180 --> 02:49:42.421]  I mean, people don't believe there's a hell?
[02:49:42.461 --> 02:49:43.742]  There's gotta be a hell!
[02:49:44.102 --> 02:49:45.423]  You people gotta pay!
[02:49:46.143 --> 02:49:48.105]  I know there's a hell, and it's ready for ya.
[02:49:48.645 --> 02:49:50.046]  It's mouth is open for ya.
[02:49:50.446 --> 02:49:52.948]  National Security Minister, Naib
[02:49:54.239 --> 02:49:59.101]  Abzob said the authorities, yeah the authorities, what, investigating your competition?
[02:49:59.422 --> 02:50:07.465]  We're investigating reports that sick children were being taken abroad for medical treatment and adoption and then being used for human transplants.
[02:50:07.646 --> 02:50:09.346]  Yeah, they tell you we're going to help you.
[02:50:09.366 --> 02:50:10.527]  A lot of the charities are involved.
[02:50:10.727 --> 02:50:13.228]  We've already confirmed this in past reports, but here it is again.
[02:50:13.688 --> 02:50:20.872]  Under the guise of adoption, children who are allegedly afflicted by grave diseases are taken out of Azerbaijan, abstentionally for treatment,
[02:50:22.468 --> 02:50:26.470]  In the course of our investigation, it's come to light that these children are used for organ transplants.
[02:50:27.991 --> 02:50:33.014]  Oh man, I tell you, and it goes into the results of the investigations will be passed to the Interior Ministry.
[02:50:33.875 --> 02:50:36.237]  And it says corruption that the government's involved.
[02:50:36.277 --> 02:50:37.197]  Of course it is.
[02:50:38.478 --> 02:50:43.081]  I mean, we are turning into hell on earth!
[02:50:45.006 --> 02:50:49.353]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:49.554 --> 02:50:53.901]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.

[02:53:45.016 --> 02:53:51.677]  Now there was another article out of the Florida Naples News.
[02:53:51.737 --> 02:53:54.418]  Human trafficking study looked towards remedies.
[02:53:55.407 --> 02:54:00.148]  Untold numbers of foreign workers are being held against their will in Florida and elsewhere.
[02:54:00.168 --> 02:54:05.450]  A fact that will require a new approach to combat illegal trafficking of humans in the United States.
[02:54:05.910 --> 02:54:07.550]  A study released Tuesday contends.
[02:54:07.590 --> 02:54:12.792]  So, more of the wondrous third world acculturation we're all enjoying.
[02:54:14.532 --> 02:54:15.033]  Amazing.
[02:54:15.553 --> 02:54:17.553]  A story out of Republic Online.
[02:54:18.474 --> 02:54:23.315]  And it says mother wants to know why child died in foster care.
[02:54:24.586 --> 02:54:36.131]  And they took her child because the school thought his child looked a little skinny and it might have been abused and then a few months later it died in CPS custody.
[02:54:36.871 --> 02:54:38.632]  That's just CPS, you know how they are.
[02:54:40.413 --> 02:54:41.533]  Good old folks.
[02:54:41.633 --> 02:54:44.354]  They're statistically the most dangerous people around.
[02:54:44.634 --> 02:54:47.716]  I got a Homeland Security, dhs.org,
[02:54:48.891 --> 02:54:52.594]  There's your NSA spying on you at the local level there for everyone out there as well.
[02:55:14.582 --> 02:55:18.303]  Bloodbath feared as Haiti opposition spurns peace plan.
[02:55:18.984 --> 02:55:27.607]  They don't want Aristide to be the leader, and well, that's what America will be like when you've got criminals running things, just more criminals trying to take over.
[02:55:28.427 --> 02:55:31.048]  The rule of law is gone, you turn into Haiti or Mexico.
[02:55:33.060 --> 02:55:35.542]  NATO and the EU to step up for the terror fight.
[02:55:35.582 --> 02:55:37.284]  They say they need to invade a bunch of countries.
[02:55:37.324 --> 02:55:38.445]  And here's an article.
[02:55:38.505 --> 02:55:42.428]  Honduras orders 400,000 chip cards for weapons control.
[02:55:42.448 --> 02:55:48.433]  If you want to own a gun, you're going to have to register it and have a chip card that tracks you that you're a gun owner.
[02:55:49.273 --> 02:55:50.895]  That's out of cardtechnology.com.
[02:55:50.935 --> 02:55:52.256]  They're very proud of that.
[02:55:53.217 --> 02:56:01.003]  And half of young Americans to get sexually transmitted diseases, according to Reuters, sexually transmitted diseases are exploding.
[02:56:02.009 --> 02:56:06.651]  Thanks to the promiscuous lifestyle that's being promoted by MTV and others.
[02:56:07.951 --> 02:56:08.752]  The U.S.
[02:56:08.812 --> 02:56:14.274]  government brings the first charges against Guantanamo inmates, Reuters says, for conspiracy charges.
[02:56:14.574 --> 02:56:16.134]  I didn't think conspiracies existed.
[02:56:16.355 --> 02:56:17.315]  How could that be possible?
[02:56:17.995 --> 02:56:19.696]  Oh, only other people's conspiracies.
[02:56:21.076 --> 02:56:23.517]  And they're not going to let anybody into those trials.
[02:56:23.557 --> 02:56:25.098]  They're kangaroo courts.
[02:56:26.653 --> 02:56:31.961]  Aristide warns that if we don't send troops in to save him, that he's going to hit us with all the boat people.
[02:56:32.422 --> 02:56:33.103]  Well, don't worry.
[02:56:33.123 --> 02:56:34.845]  I mean, we need some more third world folks.
[02:56:34.865 --> 02:56:36.468]  Let's take a few million Haitians, you know.
[02:56:36.528 --> 02:56:37.810]  It'll be a good deal.
[02:56:37.890 --> 02:56:40.153]  We've got to accept their culture of voodoo and blood drinking.
[02:56:40.474 --> 02:56:41.856]  Don't criticize them or you're evil.
[02:56:42.736 --> 02:56:44.558]  Putin dumps his entire government.
[02:56:45.218 --> 02:56:46.039]  This is out of Reuters.
[02:56:46.099 --> 02:56:54.285]  Russian President Vladimir Putin has sacked his government and has pledged to appoint a team to overall policy out of next month's presidential election.
[02:56:54.806 --> 02:56:59.690]  So he's fired the whole government as dictator and he's used terror attacks he's engineered as a way to do that.
[02:57:00.230 --> 02:57:02.612]  BBC reports Blunkett gets tough on terror.
[02:57:03.172 --> 02:57:06.575]  He's introduced martial law provisions for secret arrests.
[02:57:07.402 --> 02:57:10.724]  No more Liberties, no more Magna Carta, they're very proud of it.
[02:57:12.505 --> 02:57:16.507]  That bill in West Virginia has been rewritten where everybody has to be vaccinated.
[02:57:17.808 --> 02:57:25.132]  Now if you can get a waiver from the school, as if you're going to get one from the school, if the government will give you a waiver, you don't have to take it.
[02:57:25.392 --> 02:57:28.774]  Which of course you can't get, so it's just as bad, it's horrible.
[02:57:29.874 --> 02:57:34.777]  So no, this bill's no good that they're scheduled to try to pass today in West Virginia.
[02:57:36.364 --> 02:57:38.926]  Well, we're almost out of time here.
[02:57:38.966 --> 02:57:40.968]  There's been a bunch of asteroid near-misses.
[02:57:41.028 --> 02:57:52.819]  We covered that at the first of the show, and they said there's more asteroids coming in for collision, or near-misses, and that's on InfoWars.com from BBC and CNN.
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:58:00.867]  Again, I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on your local AM and FM station, the Internet or Global Shortwave.
[02:58:01.807 --> 02:58:07.551]  And I'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central, the first hour, I'll give you my critique of The Passion.
[02:58:08.032 --> 02:58:12.155]  We've got a bunch of other great guests coming up, so be sure to join us tomorrow as well.
[02:58:13.055 --> 02:58:16.778]  Websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:17.258 --> 02:58:25.484]  To my webmasters, the folks running the show, to our sponsors, our listeners, our affiliates, to God, to everybody, thank you for all you do.
[02:58:26.245 --> 02:58:27.486]  And stand up if evil
[02:58:28.889 --> 02:58:31.071]  If nobody stands up to evil, then it wins.
[02:58:31.151 --> 02:58:33.172]  Good people gotta stand in the gap against it.
[02:58:33.312 --> 02:58:33.953]  So stand up!
[02:58:35.394 --> 02:58:46.142]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:58:46.302 --> 02:58:53.888]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:58:54.108 --> 02:58:57.272]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
