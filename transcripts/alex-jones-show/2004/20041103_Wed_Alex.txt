[00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:09.838]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:11.299]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.282]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.803 --> 00:00:21.945]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.453]  Well, well, well, George W. Bush is our President, eh?
[00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:42.160]  Now the Republicans have one of the strongest majorities in U.S.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.740]  history.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.622]  They have even more seats in the Senate, more seats in the House of Representatives.
[00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:55.184]  They have the executive with this new four-point mandate.
[00:00:56.584 --> 00:01:00.205]  And they have seven of the nine Supreme Court justices.
[00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:02.946]  As well as, what is it?
[00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:12.504]  34 state governors of the 50 governorships, the gubernatorial seats, in the United States.
[00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:16.366]  Will we see an age of gun laws being repealed?
[00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:19.667]  An age of abortion being outlawed?
[00:01:19.827 --> 00:01:23.828]  An age of getting out of the United Nations?
[00:01:23.908 --> 00:01:25.229]  The borders being controlled?
[00:01:26.597 --> 00:01:51.554]  No, my friends, we're going to see the age of forced psychological testing and forced drugging, of new gun laws, of national drafts, of wide-open borders, of you in control in UNESCO, and tens of millions of beady-eyed neocon robot zombies will cheer it on because they associate their power with George W. Bush
[00:01:53.948 --> 00:02:01.654]  And the cult of personality, instead of loving the Bill of Rights and Constitution, it was inspired by God.
[00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:04.216]  Through our Founding Fathers.
[00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:09.060]  And on top of that, I mean, the Democrats don't care about the Bill of Rights or Constitution either.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.603]  If Kerry would have won, they would have suddenly loved the Patriot Act and the war, because Kerry was for all of that.
[00:02:14.444 --> 00:02:16.105]  They're about the cult of personality.
[00:02:17.688 --> 00:02:22.952]  John Edwards looked like a beaten dog last night when he came out there on the stage in Boston.
[00:02:22.972 --> 00:02:27.916]  Looked like somebody slapped that little trial lawyer upside the head with a 2x4.
[00:02:29.077 --> 00:02:31.659]  But the giddiness of the neocons out there.
[00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.220]  Hey, what are you celebrating?
[00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:36.343]  The free trade area of the Americas is going through.
[00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:38.605]  America is dying!
[00:02:39.065 --> 00:02:41.367]  Every major road is going to be a toll road.
[00:02:42.327 --> 00:02:49.278]  You're gonna live in a cross between 1984 and a brave new world with a national ID card in your little pocket!
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.910]  Well that's okay, I can have a local Tattletail Squad uniform and train my kid how to be a member of the Spies and...
[00:02:58.326 --> 00:02:59.867]  I'm just going to join it, Alex.
[00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:06.089]  Deep down I know it's all true and I'm scared to death, so I'll just join the New World Order, because I'm a psychological coward.
[00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.509]  I'm going to engage in double-fig, Alex.
[00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:18.453]  I'm going to make excuses and call the fascistic, neo-communistic, whatever you want to call it, Bush administration, conservative, when it ain't.
[00:03:19.493 --> 00:03:20.933]  It ain't, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:23.134 --> 00:03:25.675]  Give an aspirin a headache watching this.
[00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:29.246]  You know what?
[00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:32.528]  I'm going to go to your calls directly.
[00:03:32.548 --> 00:03:33.288]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:36.809]  Throughout the broadcast we'll be taking your calls.
[00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.530]  Your chance to respond.
[00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.171]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:41.832 --> 00:03:45.953]  Very sophisticated what happened last night.
[00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:47.714]  A lot of evidence of election fraud.
[00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:50.535]  But that's only one layer of the onion.
[00:03:50.555 --> 00:03:51.656]  We'll be covering that as well.
[00:03:51.676 --> 00:03:53.977]  Bev Harris joining us second hour.
[00:03:54.057 --> 00:03:56.998]  Paul Watson joining us for 30 minutes in this hour.
[00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:06.326]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv InfoWars.net, by the way, has a new great webmaster on it.
[00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:09.068]  They're all been updated with all the key information.
[00:04:09.908 --> 00:04:16.911]  We'll be covering it when we return from this quick break, but again, the toll-free number to join us on air 1-800-259-9231
[00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:25.507]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:25.567 --> 00:04:32.433]  I have some notes that I wrote down last night and this morning.
[00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:34.214]  I didn't get much sleep.
[00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.416]  I was on Coast to Coast AM last night for a segment.
[00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.397]  I'll be on for three hours tonight.
[00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:46.364]  But I did write some notes last night and this morning, and I just want to go over some of those notes, then a few of the top stories, then we'll go right to your calls.
[00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.171]  At 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:50.672 --> 00:04:54.755]  Your chance to respond to the farce that was the Skull & Bones election.
[00:04:55.135 --> 00:04:56.556]  Skull & Bones won, folks!
[00:04:56.956 --> 00:04:57.937]  They're in the White House!
[00:04:57.977 --> 00:04:58.457]  Either way!
[00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:09.057]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.477 --> 00:05:13.698]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:20.980]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.462]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.602 --> 00:05:28.822]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.105]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.287]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.588 --> 00:05:41.835]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:45.519]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:06:01.192 --> 00:06:11.920]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:19.685]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:23.088]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:23.328 --> 00:06:29.096]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:35.544]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:35.884 --> 00:06:39.789]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.712]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:41.892 --> 00:06:47.856]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.

[00:06:59.905 --> 00:07:05.289]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:09.912]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:10.032 --> 00:07:11.293]  There is a chance
[00:07:11.773 --> 00:07:14.415]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:15.835]  The New World Order.
[00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:17.296]  Animersive.
[00:07:17.576 --> 00:07:21.799]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:28.803]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.903 --> 00:07:30.924]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:31.164 --> 00:07:41.708]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:47.270]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:51.551]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:52.852]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.300]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.021]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:09.821]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:11.322]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.062 --> 00:08:13.982]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.002 --> 00:08:17.283]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.804 --> 00:08:21.865]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.254 --> 00:08:40.119]  Well, George W. Bush came out of the early morning hours today and said, I'm back.
[00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:42.220]  I am your leader.
[00:08:43.801 --> 00:08:52.387]  And Mr. Card, his chief of staff, of course, was out a few hours ago repeating this is a decisive, giant mandate from the people.
[00:08:54.428 --> 00:09:00.232]  Meanwhile, group tallies more than 1,100 e-voting glitches.
[00:09:00.252 --> 00:09:01.913]  Yeah, they're glitches, alright.
[00:09:03.197 --> 00:09:09.743]  Votes still being counted in three states, but again folks, it looks like it's going to be Lord Bush.
[00:09:10.504 --> 00:09:14.828]  It's not like it matters if Lord Bush didn't win and be his cousin, Lord Kerry.
[00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:24.618]  Also, Electronic Voting Machine Woes reported again, this is out of the Associated Press, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Ohio.
[00:09:25.018 --> 00:09:27.741]  It has been massive, and don't forget the owner of Diebold,
[00:09:28.547 --> 00:09:35.770]  Said last year, I will deliver all the electoral votes in Ohio to George W. Bush with my voting machines.
[00:09:36.791 --> 00:09:40.832]  And the exit polls showed, I mean, there was a record voter turnout.
[00:09:41.153 --> 00:09:42.233]  Most of them were Democrats.
[00:09:42.913 --> 00:09:45.795]  And I have no doubt that there has not been massive election fraud.
[00:09:46.495 --> 00:09:54.278]  Now before neocons go into fetal convulsions, you know, flopping around on the ground, I'm not for John Kerry either, okay?
[00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:57.880]  But just the facts, just the evidence,
[00:09:58.687 --> 00:09:59.128]  Okay?
[00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:19.524]  We were hearing from polling judges, election judges, the media, alternative media at the polls, people I know personally, all over the country, listeners, that there were record lines, whoever heard of three-hour lines, two-hour lines, hour-long lines here in Austin, Texas?
[00:10:20.605 --> 00:10:26.109]  And they're only claiming that 15 million more people voted this time than last time?
[00:10:26.129 --> 00:10:27.991]  120-something million total?
[00:10:28.732 --> 00:10:30.032]  It was way more than that.
[00:10:30.893 --> 00:10:34.153]  But very mysterious with these machines.
[00:10:34.193 --> 00:10:35.474]  A lot of evidence of fraud.
[00:10:37.254 --> 00:10:39.794]  Meanwhile, we're going to end up again having Hillary Clinton.
[00:10:40.095 --> 00:10:42.355]  Hillary 2008 already in gear.
[00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:50.957]  The outcome of yesterday's presidential election could determine whether Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton will have a chance to return her family to the White House.
[00:10:51.670 --> 00:11:17.747]  Of course, you'll have Clinton by then, this is already admitted, as Secretary General, and they're going to run Hillary, have a con-con before that, get the 22nd Amendment out of there, and then conservatives will vote for Arnold Schwarzenegger, and we'll end up having a foreign-born person who says he admires Hitler, and wants to be a dictator, and that he hates black people, and that he poses for gay porno mags, that he's part of a secret society's bohemian grove,
[00:11:18.459 --> 00:11:21.260]  And he's for abortion, gun control, open borders.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.140]  Hey, you're going to love him.
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.260]  You love Bush.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.360]  You're going to love Arnold.
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.881]  I'm talking to the beady-eyed neocon listeners out there.
[00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:29.981]  Just great.
[00:11:30.741 --> 00:11:32.081]  And I'm not saying vote for Hillary.
[00:11:32.562 --> 00:11:39.143]  They give you choices that you cannot argue with.
[00:11:39.243 --> 00:11:41.363]  It's just, my gosh, we can't go with Hillary.
[00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:45.924]  Well, yes, I will vote for Hillary Clinton over Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:11:46.511 --> 00:11:53.872]  Because she was born here, and because she's so bad and so evil, that she'll never get away with anything because we'll be after her.
[00:11:54.373 --> 00:11:59.033]  But I know you're going to vote for Arnold Schwarzenegger, and even if you didn't, he's going to be your next president.
[00:12:00.174 --> 00:12:02.214]  Just enjoy yourselves!
[00:12:02.814 --> 00:12:06.035]  No other country has foreign people running it, but you'll love it!
[00:12:06.455 --> 00:12:07.015]  You'll love it!
[00:12:07.035 --> 00:12:07.855]  You're going to love it!
[00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:12.076]  I'm going to be evil in four years, because I'm going to be against Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:12:15.345 --> 00:12:16.947]  So we'll get into that.
[00:12:17.408 --> 00:12:21.974]  But don't worry, speaking of foreigners, Russian observers shocked by U.S.
[00:12:22.034 --> 00:12:23.016]  election procedures.
[00:12:23.717 --> 00:12:29.465]  Again, Satan came over here to investigate Baphomet or Beelzebub.
[00:12:31.472 --> 00:12:33.754]  I mean, in Russia, it's a one-party system.
[00:12:33.794 --> 00:12:38.377]  They're abolishing elections at the state level, putting in regional governorships.
[00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:41.579]  Putin's been caught blowing up buildings to blame it on his enemies.
[00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:43.780]  Caught red-handed by Moscow police.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.063]  And they send over a Russian parliamentarian to take part in international monitoring of the U.S.
[00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:53.366]  presidential election, has said that the election was held in violation of U.S.
[00:12:53.406 --> 00:12:56.468]  law, and that he was shocked at seeing how the elections were held.
[00:12:59.488 --> 00:13:01.729]  The Russians are just shocked by us.
[00:13:01.749 --> 00:13:04.331]  It's just horrible to see.
[00:13:04.892 --> 00:13:05.752]  This is how they do it.
[00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:14.298]  All right, let me go over my notes and then I'll get into all this news I just mentioned after we take calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:14.338 --> 00:13:16.919]  Republicans extend a decade of House control.
[00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:19.341]  This is with three states still not reporting.
[00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:38.356]  Republicans extended their decade-long hold on the House for another two years, knocking off four Texas Democrats along the way alone.
[00:13:39.257 --> 00:13:45.000]  Among their few setbacks was the defeat of the longest-serving GOP member in the chamber, Representative Phil Crane.
[00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:54.826]  And it looks like they won dozens of new seats, four in Texas alone with the redistricting, and
[00:13:56.972 --> 00:14:11.316]  On top of that, it looks like they've won five, maybe six, maybe seven, but for sure, five more seats in the Senate for a hearty, hearty majority.
[00:14:11.636 --> 00:14:12.977]  So, let's get this straight.
[00:14:14.237 --> 00:14:15.497]  They have the legislative.
[00:14:17.058 --> 00:14:17.478]  Congress.
[00:14:19.078 --> 00:14:20.759]  They have the judicial.
[00:14:21.179 --> 00:14:21.919]  Supreme Court.
[00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:23.000]  Seven of the nine.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.240]  Republican appointed.
[00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:32.394]  They now have the executive branch with a lame duck, which that name is deceiving.
[00:14:33.215 --> 00:14:34.676]  It doesn't mean it's really bad.
[00:14:35.096 --> 00:14:35.996]  It's bad for the people.
[00:14:36.356 --> 00:14:39.638]  Bush can do whatever he wants, he's not facing re-election.
[00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:50.904]  And now his public dream of getting an assault weapons ban, of getting rid of the borders, of the free trade area of the Americas, all of it's going to come true for you and your family, don't worry.
[00:14:51.938 --> 00:14:56.300]  He said our number one export earlier this year is high-tech jobs and jobs.
[00:14:56.861 --> 00:14:58.782]  He said hamburger jobs are high-tech.
[00:14:59.442 --> 00:15:15.571]  So you just smile and you just giggle your little hearts out about how you've had this big personal victory because you associated your power with George W. It's amazing.
[00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:17.872]  And so they've got everything.
[00:15:19.602 --> 00:15:27.685]  And you watch, folks, they're going to pass some more gun control laws, blanket total amnesty, free trade area of the Americas that is the American Union.
[00:15:28.566 --> 00:15:29.286]  They admit it is!
[00:15:29.766 --> 00:15:33.008]  That was the first thing Bush did three and a half years ago when he got in office.
[00:15:33.608 --> 00:15:34.708]  Almost four years ago now.
[00:15:35.048 --> 00:15:36.569]  Let's go to Canada and sign that deal.
[00:15:36.929 --> 00:15:38.570]  Clinton, of course, everybody else is for it.
[00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.671]  You never hear about it on the news.
[00:15:41.251 --> 00:15:44.252]  Sign on to UNESCO that Ronald Reagan pulled us out of.
[00:15:44.492 --> 00:15:48.594]  That Bill Clinton didn't dare sign back onto because of the backlash of conservatives.
[00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:53.703]  He wants total blanket amnesty, my friends.
[00:15:54.684 --> 00:16:02.551]  And now they have the National ID Card, Patriot Act 2, Total Information Awareness Network, Super Bill, waiting in conference, about to go to the President.
[00:16:05.498 --> 00:16:09.039]  You'll have to have a card to have a job anywhere, to do anything.
[00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:11.040]  Everything you do will be tracked and traced.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:16.541]  Homeland security will be over every facet of the economy.
[00:16:16.741 --> 00:16:18.142]  I have seen Ridge say it.
[00:16:18.582 --> 00:16:19.562]  I have read the plans.
[00:16:19.822 --> 00:16:21.542]  I've been telling you this for two and a half years.
[00:16:22.263 --> 00:16:24.823]  Since I saw him on C-SPAN talk about it, then I got the documents.
[00:16:25.304 --> 00:16:33.946]  I mean, again, pot dealers, homeschoolers, people in bed rigging, county commissioners giving people more parking spaces.
[00:16:34.884 --> 00:16:37.046]  Patriot Act of Homeland Security has been used for all of it.
[00:16:37.306 --> 00:16:39.328]  One of the best examples just came out last week.
[00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:40.309]  St.
[00:16:40.369 --> 00:16:41.830]  Helens, the town outside Mount St.
[00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.593]  Helens, a tiny 2,000 square foot toy store.
[00:16:44.953 --> 00:16:49.157]  The woman bought a dozen Magic Cubes knockoffs of the Rubik's Cube.
[00:16:49.197 --> 00:16:50.378]  Turns out they're totally legal.
[00:16:50.398 --> 00:16:51.059]  The patent's up.
[00:16:51.659 --> 00:16:53.321]  They call her for months, harass her.
[00:16:53.341 --> 00:16:55.423]  Homeland Security wouldn't tell her what it was about.
[00:16:55.443 --> 00:16:56.344]  She was scared to death.
[00:16:56.644 --> 00:17:00.527]  When they finally drove two agents to her office,
[00:17:01.781 --> 00:17:02.141]  In St.
[00:17:02.161 --> 00:17:08.484]  Helen, the tiny town, they told her without an order, without a piece of paper, they said you take them off your shelf and you don't sell them.
[00:17:08.804 --> 00:17:09.784]  Homeland Security.
[00:17:09.944 --> 00:17:11.545]  This is infrastructure protection.
[00:17:12.185 --> 00:17:13.306]  Rubik's Cubes!
[00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:14.646]  Let me say it again.
[00:17:15.087 --> 00:17:16.427]  Rubik's Cubes!
[00:17:16.507 --> 00:17:17.688]  Do you understand?
[00:17:17.908 --> 00:17:19.008]  Everything you do.
[00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:21.029]  Forced psychological testing.
[00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:22.490]  Forced drugging.
[00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:24.130]  Everything you do, tracked.
[00:17:24.451 --> 00:17:27.852]  Transponders and satellite tracker boxes in your cars.
[00:17:28.132 --> 00:17:30.093]  Face scanning cameras everywhere.
[00:17:30.733 --> 00:17:31.834]  Everything run by them.
[00:17:31.994 --> 00:17:41.222]  Your children, when they're 17, 18, 2 years, when they're juniors and seniors, will forcibly have to serve in gray uniforms with arm bands.
[00:17:41.382 --> 00:17:43.243]  I had the federal plan in 98.
[00:17:43.504 --> 00:17:49.849]  I put it in a film under infrastructure protection because I got the federal document and now they're doing it!
[00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:58.856]  And I'm not going to have my family wearing gray uniforms and arm bands and a lot of these punks are going to like it, but I don't like it!
[00:18:02.992 --> 00:18:05.313]  The border is wide open!
[00:18:07.694 --> 00:18:08.895]  Wide open!
[00:18:09.315 --> 00:18:12.256]  But they got agents out harassing toy stores!
[00:18:13.296 --> 00:18:14.697]  In one-horse towns!
[00:18:16.558 --> 00:18:17.938]  So you just celebrate.
[00:18:19.059 --> 00:18:21.240]  And again, I'd be acting like this if John Kerry won.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.720]  No matter who wins, we lose.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.541]  It's staged, people!
[00:18:27.362 --> 00:18:31.344]  So you're gonna get your open borders, you're gonna get your Patriot Act, National ID card,
[00:18:32.426 --> 00:18:35.707]  You're going to get your lame-duck president with his assault weapons ban.
[00:18:37.087 --> 00:18:38.587]  He's going to put conservatives to sleep.
[00:18:40.207 --> 00:18:44.228]  And of course, Karl Rove told the New York Daily News that, hey, this is a little gift from Bin Laden.
[00:18:45.168 --> 00:18:46.329]  We want to thank him for this.
[00:18:46.389 --> 00:18:47.309]  Yeah, of course, folks.
[00:18:48.069 --> 00:18:52.330]  That computer-generated Max Headroom up there saying what they needed to hear.
[00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.790]  People go, well, he said some mean things about us.
[00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.070]  Was it really Bin Laden?
[00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.991]  Yeah, that's how propaganda works, to make it convincing.
[00:19:02.973 --> 00:19:05.535]  And we're facing Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:10.077]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:19:10.157 --> 00:19:12.579]  I mean, it's so obvious, the arrogance, all of it.
[00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:16.501]  They're going to run Arnold against Hillary in 2008.
[00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:17.602]  You're going to vote for him.
[00:19:17.622 --> 00:19:20.103]  They're going to have a con-con long before then.
[00:19:21.564 --> 00:19:31.290]  After a convenient terror attack, we're going to have a national draft and a constitutional convention, and we'll get rid of the 22nd Amendment, and then, well, I didn't want to have a foreigner, but he's better than Hillary.
[00:19:33.803 --> 00:19:35.683]  It is great to be your president.
[00:19:35.723 --> 00:19:37.624]  This is a historic day.
[00:19:42.065 --> 00:19:42.745]  It's incredible.
[00:19:43.145 --> 00:19:44.866]  How do I know Arnold is going to do this?
[00:19:44.926 --> 00:19:56.388]  Because it would not put up with anyone else saying he hates black people, posing for gay pornomags, loving Hitler, admiring Hitler.
[00:19:56.408 --> 00:19:58.989]  He is your coming man.
[00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.732]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.233 --> 00:20:08.653]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:20:09.154 --> 00:20:09.814]  Let's update.
[00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:13.775]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:20:14.455 --> 00:20:18.156]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[00:20:18.836 --> 00:20:19.796]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:20:19.816 --> 00:20:22.137]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[00:20:22.657 --> 00:20:23.577]  Today, the U.S.
[00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:25.838]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[00:20:26.218 --> 00:20:27.718]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:30.294]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[00:20:31.656 --> 00:20:36.523]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:20:37.524 --> 00:20:39.687]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[00:20:40.087 --> 00:20:42.651]  There's a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:20:43.268 --> 00:20:44.649]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.792]  Physical possession, private gold.

[00:24:14.057 --> 00:24:14.898]  Danny, go ahead.
[00:24:15.398 --> 00:24:17.759]  Hey Alex, I wanted to comment on the election.
[00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:19.260]  I've also got a question for you.
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:27.685]  I have been checking some of the different states, and of course the exit polls had Kerry just basically spanking Bush.
[00:24:28.485 --> 00:24:33.748]  The states that have paper ballots, the exit polls were perfectly accurate.
[00:24:34.113 --> 00:24:34.794]  No, I know this.
[00:24:34.834 --> 00:24:37.677]  It's like Howard Dean won or tied in all the districts
[00:24:53.305 --> 00:25:09.236]  up in New Hampshire and other states when he was running the primaries against Kerry he would win or tie when it wasn't a Diebold or a Hardener Civics machine but then he would lose by 10-15 points wherever there was those machines.
[00:25:09.576 --> 00:25:19.163]  Folks I have a giant stack of them admitting it's a fraud but again it doesn't matter who won it was it was staged at that level too but but yes 34 percent of the country
[00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:27.274]  Voted on the electronic machines with no record, no receipt, no way to check it, and they just say, just pressed us.
[00:25:28.554 --> 00:25:30.035]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[00:25:30.575 --> 00:25:47.023]  And my question for you is this, and I'm starting to run into the same thing in Tennessee now, is as far as where the electronic voting machines are going in, like Texas and the toll roads, my question is, if we've got leaders
[00:25:47.884 --> 00:25:51.766]  Going against a 90% public opposition, 95%.
[00:25:52.026 --> 00:26:08.635]  It's 98% in major polls, and in meetings they had in Houston, 93% in Austin, and the mayors look at you and say, I don't care what you do, try to vote me out, and they reach over and just pack the voting machine and go, by the way, we got men with machine guns, we run things, get used to it.
[00:26:08.815 --> 00:26:10.196]  Yeah, it's just mafia run.
[00:26:10.216 --> 00:26:13.898]  Is there anything, can these officials be brought up on charges?
[00:26:13.938 --> 00:26:15.139]  Is there anything we can do?
[00:26:15.259 --> 00:26:15.459]  I mean,
[00:26:15.939 --> 00:26:22.961]  Because the way I look at it, if there's a 98% public opposition and an official is passing a bill, I call that treason.
[00:26:24.421 --> 00:26:25.622]  And... Well, that's the way it works.
[00:26:25.662 --> 00:26:27.702]  And that's going to be their problem with these machines.
[00:26:27.742 --> 00:26:30.403]  So they're going to have to act like it's close and have these staged events.
[00:26:30.483 --> 00:26:31.243]  But it stays.
[00:26:31.263 --> 00:26:32.063]  Thanks for the call, Danny.
[00:26:32.103 --> 00:26:32.603]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:26:32.843 --> 00:26:33.524]  You bet.
[00:26:33.544 --> 00:26:35.604]  Delilah in Ohio, up there.
[00:26:36.044 --> 00:26:37.125]  The Keys State.
[00:26:37.925 --> 00:26:38.725]  Welcome, Delilah.
[00:26:39.446 --> 00:26:41.227]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:26:41.247 --> 00:26:41.927]  I appreciate it.
[00:26:42.027 --> 00:26:42.447]  You bet.
[00:26:42.727 --> 00:26:45.088]  I have two questions and a comment.
[00:26:45.108 --> 00:26:46.628]  Let me make the comment first.
[00:26:47.749 --> 00:27:00.453]  There was an article on the internet, I forgot where, if it was from the Associated Press or someplace else, where it talked about some journalist was arrested because he was taking pictures of people at the voting booths with the long lines.
[00:27:00.493 --> 00:27:01.493]  Did you hear about that?
[00:27:03.234 --> 00:27:03.934]  Uh, yes I did.
[00:27:04.234 --> 00:27:04.814]  Oh, okay.
[00:27:05.574 --> 00:27:07.195]  Okay, now I have two questions.
[00:27:07.295 --> 00:27:07.715]  Now that
[00:27:08.547 --> 00:27:10.707]  Pretty much so called the election is over.
[00:27:10.727 --> 00:27:18.909]  Um, what are their plans are as far as like, I already know they're going to pass the military draft or I already know that.
[00:27:19.009 --> 00:27:21.930]  My question is there were different versions of it.
[00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.271]  Which version are they likely to pass?
[00:27:25.351 --> 00:27:25.891]  Number one.
[00:27:25.991 --> 00:27:32.972]  And then number two, um, how soon are the next attacks supposed to, to occur to bring this out?
[00:27:33.253 --> 00:27:33.633]  Thank you.
[00:27:34.913 --> 00:27:35.133]  Well,
[00:27:37.134 --> 00:27:41.515]  I think in the next 365 days, you're going to see a catastrophic attack in this country.
[00:27:42.595 --> 00:27:47.396]  And then Bush is going to get up there and bite his lip and go, well, it's not a draft, but it's an emergency conscription.
[00:27:48.216 --> 00:27:51.096]  It's like, this is not an amnesty, it's just the biggest amnesty ever.
[00:27:52.517 --> 00:27:57.358]  Now they say they don't, you know, change, you know, it's like his dad said, read my lips, know your taxes, and then raise taxes.
[00:27:57.818 --> 00:28:02.818]  Well, you know, today in the double speak of me, this is not a tax, this is a funding mechanism.
[00:28:04.019 --> 00:28:05.559]  But I don't have a crystal ball.
[00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:08.666]  There's another facet to this.
[00:28:08.726 --> 00:28:10.287]  They may not even bring in a draft.
[00:28:10.307 --> 00:28:16.852]  Though, obviously, they've already got a draft with troops that have already served their time and are being forcibly re-upped, so there really is a draft.
[00:28:17.453 --> 00:28:21.576]  And they're talking about specialty drafts immediately, and they've already got them going at Dover Air Force Base.
[00:28:21.596 --> 00:28:22.777]  There's a million contractors there.
[00:28:22.797 --> 00:28:25.539]  They're going, by the way, you signed that contract, you're going to Iraq.
[00:28:25.779 --> 00:28:26.880]  What, you didn't read the fine print?
[00:28:28.602 --> 00:28:33.605]  But they could tie us down overseas and then bring in foreign assets here domestically during an attack.
[00:28:34.006 --> 00:28:36.888]  I mean, the whole Pentagon's been out there saying that, getting us ready for it.
[00:28:37.934 --> 00:28:39.074]  So that's the bottom line there.
[00:28:39.494 --> 00:28:40.795]  Don in Ohio.
[00:28:40.835 --> 00:28:41.555]  Don, welcome.
[00:28:42.955 --> 00:28:43.255]  Hello.
[00:28:43.515 --> 00:28:43.755]  Yes.
[00:28:44.576 --> 00:28:47.996]  Yeah, I got a couple things and a prediction and a criticism of you.
[00:28:49.157 --> 00:28:56.458]  First of all, in my county, here in Ohio, I would say 1 in 5 voted for Kerry, but yet they showed a lot closer than that.
[00:28:56.518 --> 00:28:59.319]  I just can't see that, except for provisional votes.
[00:29:00.879 --> 00:29:04.440]  My thing is, they say there's 134,000 or whatever it is.
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.021]  I think it's much, much higher than that.
[00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:06.681]  I'd say it's in the 300s.
[00:29:08.067 --> 00:29:09.088]  And what's going to happen?
[00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:11.369]  My prediction is they're going to find that out.
[00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.872]  And I would say probably 85% are for Kerry.
[00:29:16.272 --> 00:29:22.196]  And then you think it'll be $269, $269 and then it goes to the House of Reps.
[00:29:22.396 --> 00:29:22.876]  You got it.
[00:29:23.617 --> 00:29:24.937]  And then we'll have a three ring circus.
[00:29:25.298 --> 00:29:26.138]  What's your criticism?
[00:29:28.095 --> 00:29:29.356]  I can say you exaggerate a little bit.
[00:29:29.376 --> 00:29:30.417]  Just like this Mercury thing.
[00:29:30.457 --> 00:29:32.099]  You say they're saying Mercury is good for you.
[00:29:32.419 --> 00:29:34.361]  If you listen real close, that's not what they're saying.
[00:29:34.702 --> 00:29:35.743]  They're saying Mercury is... Okay, stay there.
[00:29:35.943 --> 00:29:36.343]  Stay there.
[00:29:36.584 --> 00:29:38.085]  Can you find the Mercury clip, guys?
[00:29:38.786 --> 00:29:40.968]  See if you can find that on the computer.
[00:29:41.008 --> 00:29:42.409]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:43.931]  I do not exaggerate.
[00:29:44.712 --> 00:29:47.595]  In fact, usually I underestimate the level of evil.
[00:29:48.255 --> 00:29:48.916]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.116 --> 00:29:49.516]  PersonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:51.653 --> 00:29:54.661]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.584 --> 00:29:58.251]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.178 --> 00:30:04.261]  Dad, that cocoon stuff really got rid of your gray hair!
[00:30:04.421 --> 00:30:10.946]  I'm that 44 year old guy you've heard talking about taking Cocoon GH and how it helped reverse my gray hairs.
[00:30:11.066 --> 00:30:12.868]  And here's some more great news.
[00:30:12.988 --> 00:30:16.471]  Taking Cocoon GH can improve your life in many ways.
[00:30:16.611 --> 00:30:21.975]  Cocoon basically repairs your body to a youthful state you perhaps had 10 or 20 years ago.
[00:30:22.195 --> 00:30:24.758]  I'm taking Cocoon GH and here's what I notice.
[00:30:24.938 --> 00:30:30.162]  After a few sprays in my mouth, I'm in peak condition mentally, emotionally, and physically.
[00:30:30.162 --> 00:30:30.422]  Absolutely.
[00:30:30.442 --> 00:30:33.384]  In the state I get from Cocoon, I feel unstoppable.
[00:30:33.684 --> 00:30:35.505]  And you can have the same feeling.
[00:30:35.765 --> 00:30:45.712]  If you're tired, run down, want to boost your sexual performance, want to help wipe out back pain or arthritis, you need to start taking Cocoon GH right now.
[00:30:46.012 --> 00:30:50.114]  If you want similar results, call now to order Cocoon GH.
[00:30:50.254 --> 00:30:51.075]  Here's the number.
[00:30:51.135 --> 00:30:51.775]  800-814-5031.
[00:30:51.795 --> 00:30:52.635]  800-814-5031.
[00:30:52.655 --> 00:30:53.996]  800-814-5031.
[00:30:54.196 --> 00:31:02.737]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter.
[00:31:02.837 --> 00:31:08.319]  An inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:19.521]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:31:19.781 --> 00:31:21.584]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:31:21.864 --> 00:31:25.189]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:31:25.529 --> 00:31:35.984]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:31:36.264 --> 00:31:36.764]  That's right.
[00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:44.070]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.473]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:31:48.653 --> 00:31:52.776]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.796 --> 00:31:53.376]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:53.396 --> 00:31:55.097]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis.
[00:32:03.183 --> 00:32:04.104]  But it didn't help much.
[00:32:04.325 --> 00:32:06.768]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:12.196]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[00:32:12.356 --> 00:32:13.057]  Well, no more.
[00:32:13.238 --> 00:32:16.182]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[00:32:16.482 --> 00:32:19.707]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[00:32:19.947 --> 00:32:25.449]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:28.210]  It's called hyaluronic acid or HA.
[00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:36.253]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[00:32:36.473 --> 00:32:39.694]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[00:32:39.894 --> 00:32:44.136]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[00:32:44.416 --> 00:32:47.397]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[00:32:47.617 --> 00:32:49.941]  Call 1-800-707-3953 and get one bottle free when you buy two.
[00:32:49.981 --> 00:32:52.846]  Remember, call 1-800-707-3953 and get your free bottle of Injuve when you buy two.
[00:32:52.866 --> 00:32:53.266]  Call today!
[00:33:10.201 --> 00:33:17.387]  Alright, coming up we'll get into the electronic voting machine fraud run by the Republicans and we've got Democrats trying to steal votes the old-fashioned way.
[00:33:18.468 --> 00:33:21.631]  Reports of this in all 50 states, being caught red-handed doing it.
[00:33:21.651 --> 00:33:24.933]  I mean obviously George W. Bush is our new leader.
[00:33:25.894 --> 00:33:27.996]  Meet the same boss, the same old boss.
[00:33:29.665 --> 00:33:35.330]  We've gotten fooled again, and again, I'm depressed whether George W. Bush wins or John Forbes Carey wins.
[00:33:35.891 --> 00:33:36.872]  It's the same thing.
[00:33:37.892 --> 00:33:42.937]  And we're going to have Paul Watson on here in about 5-10 minutes to give us his analysis of the election.
[00:33:42.957 --> 00:33:47.381]  And we've got Beth Harris in the next hour, and of course, more of your phone calls coming up.
[00:33:47.441 --> 00:33:53.326]  But, John in Ohio called up and he said that he thinks I exaggerate.
[00:33:53.466 --> 00:33:53.947]  Just a little.
[00:33:54.625 --> 00:33:56.226]  Okay, and I do not exaggerate.
[00:33:56.786 --> 00:34:04.531]  He said that I exaggerate about this newscast that said that Mercury is actually good for you in the vaccines.
[00:34:04.751 --> 00:34:12.135]  And by the way, I wasn't just going off this newscast, but scores of mainstream news articles about the two federal studies.
[00:34:12.715 --> 00:34:18.700]  So here's that newscast from a couple months ago that aired here locally, and clones of it aired all over the country.
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.101]  So here is that clip.
[00:34:20.561 --> 00:34:21.222]  Go ahead and play it.
[00:34:21.602 --> 00:34:24.044]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[00:34:24.264 --> 00:34:27.627]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[00:34:27.907 --> 00:34:29.949]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[00:34:30.049 --> 00:34:32.711]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[00:34:32.731 --> 00:34:36.254]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Shima Matthews.
[00:34:38.769 --> 00:34:44.751]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:34:45.211 --> 00:34:51.634]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[00:34:51.654 --> 00:34:59.076]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:00.557]  See, there you go.
[00:35:00.617 --> 00:35:01.837]  That's exactly what I was saying.
[00:35:02.097 --> 00:35:03.438]  They say improved behavior.
[00:35:03.498 --> 00:35:07.079]  Their idea of improved behavior is like giving your kids Ritalin and everything else.
[00:35:07.594 --> 00:35:13.137]  Really what it's doing, if you listen to the words very carefully, they're telling you that the mercury dumbed down your kid.
[00:35:13.517 --> 00:35:19.080]  But you keep using the thing nutritious and good for you, and I think what you've got to do is you've got to listen to the exact words that they say.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.681]  It's just like the neocons.
[00:35:20.861 --> 00:35:24.403]  Well sir, let me talk since you've made this challenge here.
[00:35:24.843 --> 00:35:25.284]  Okay?
[00:35:26.024 --> 00:35:27.225]  Obviously when I go
[00:35:28.295 --> 00:35:31.078]  Oh yes, Mercury is part of your nutritious breakfast.
[00:35:31.578 --> 00:35:34.080]  Anyone listening knows I'm being sarcastic.
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:46.410]  Then I play the clip, and then I read the study, where they're now, first they were saying we don't put Mercury in it, then oh, we took it out, oh now we've put 250 times safe levels, I have the AP articles.
[00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:50.552]  On the website where they actually increase the levels in many of the vaccines.
[00:35:50.933 --> 00:35:54.014]  And yes, here they are saying it's actually improving your behavior.
[00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:58.697]  And so, improving your behavior, helping your children, that's saying it's good for you.
[00:35:58.937 --> 00:36:01.659]  You're saying they're not implying that it's good for you.
[00:36:01.979 --> 00:36:05.461]  No, I'm saying they're implying that it's really dumbing down your child.
[00:36:05.561 --> 00:36:08.363]  I don't think anyone would agree with you that I exaggerated there.
[00:36:08.403 --> 00:36:09.724]  That is a ridiculous clip.
[00:36:09.924 --> 00:36:12.926]  Now tell me something else I exaggerate about.
[00:36:14.577 --> 00:36:15.098]  Nothing, really.
[00:36:15.138 --> 00:36:16.060]  You know, I love you, Alex.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.402]  I love your show and everything else.
[00:36:18.184 --> 00:36:18.905]  What I don't like is...
[00:36:19.991 --> 00:36:20.972]  Maybe it's your sarcasm.
[00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:22.313]  Maybe you just go a little too far.
[00:36:22.413 --> 00:36:22.753]  I don't know.
[00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:23.994]  No, no, no.
[00:36:24.094 --> 00:36:29.358]  I got an email the other day from somebody going, Alex, you said over a thousand people in Mexico have taken the chip.
[00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:31.719]  I found the article that says 304.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.563]  Well, that was the first day for the internal judicial workers.
[00:36:36.843 --> 00:36:39.044]  Then they did three more waves of people.
[00:36:39.345 --> 00:36:41.586]  Now they're talking about making the federales do it.
[00:36:41.846 --> 00:36:43.147]  So, see, I live this.
[00:36:43.487 --> 00:36:44.708]  I'm constantly looking at it.
[00:36:44.908 --> 00:36:46.870]  And so somebody's got an old piece of info
[00:36:47.711 --> 00:36:48.912]  I tape my TV show.
[00:36:48.992 --> 00:36:49.954]  I tape my TV show.
[00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:51.015]  I do a live TV show.
[00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:52.216]  I turn the tapes in.
[00:36:52.477 --> 00:36:54.239]  Shows I did 5 years ago are still airing.
[00:36:54.499 --> 00:37:01.649]  So somebody will watch a TV show from 5 years ago where I say that 3 million people are in prison.
[00:37:02.176 --> 00:37:08.199]  And then somebody will watch a new TV show and I'll say 7 million are and they'll go, well wait a minute, you just said the other day 3 million.
[00:37:08.279 --> 00:37:08.899]  Right, right.
[00:37:08.919 --> 00:37:13.702]  Sir, believe me, I am neurotic about being accurate.
[00:37:13.722 --> 00:37:15.062]  See, I'm right there with you Alex.
[00:37:15.643 --> 00:37:17.884]  I live this stuff too and it's been driving me crazy.
[00:37:17.924 --> 00:37:19.064]  But anyway, change the subject.
[00:37:19.084 --> 00:37:20.765]  You're going to be on Coast to Coast tonight still?
[00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:21.265]  Yes.
[00:37:21.585 --> 00:37:22.006]  That's great.
[00:37:22.026 --> 00:37:22.766]  I look forward to it.
[00:37:23.266 --> 00:37:26.968]  Yeah, from 1 to 4 central.
[00:37:27.548 --> 00:37:28.189]  Thanks for the call.
[00:37:28.209 --> 00:37:28.589]  Alright.
[00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:30.690]  Alright, we've got Paul Watson coming up here.
[00:37:31.742 --> 00:37:35.505]  But first, Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts.
[00:37:36.485 --> 00:37:39.367]  Bottom line, folks, stop drinking the water.
[00:37:39.527 --> 00:37:40.488]  It's full of poison.
[00:37:40.528 --> 00:37:41.469]  It's full of garbage.
[00:37:41.909 --> 00:37:42.990]  Take control of your life.
[00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:48.814]  These systems are made in America, produced in America, manufactured, sold in America.
[00:37:49.374 --> 00:37:53.237]  All American employees, all American parts, right here in America.
[00:37:53.677 --> 00:37:55.618]  And Debbie Morrow, good to have you on with us.
[00:37:55.638 --> 00:37:57.960]  How do folks get themselves a big Berkey?
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.621]  Well, hi there, Alex.
[00:38:00.103 --> 00:38:13.531]  They get themselves a big Berkey or a Berkey light system by calling me at toll free 1-888-803-4438 and I'll help them meet all of their water needs.
[00:38:13.611 --> 00:38:19.434]  We'll talk about what kind of water they have and what they're wanting to get out of it and we'll get them set up.
[00:38:19.554 --> 00:38:27.579]  And we have several specials available for your listeners and I'll go over those specials with them as well.
[00:38:28.485 --> 00:38:36.871]  And, you know, this is the time to start really taking control of your own personal health and your own personal situation.
[00:38:38.192 --> 00:38:41.895]  And so by getting a Berkey water filter, you're able to do that.
[00:38:42.295 --> 00:38:53.843]  And I get call after call of people thanking us that they love their water, that they're so pleased and so happy and they're saving money and they're drinking water that they're assured is good.
[00:38:54.003 --> 00:38:56.865]  And again, people go out to the hardware store and they buy a $150
[00:38:58.867 --> 00:39:04.872]  Uh, filtration system, it's charcoal that only cuts out the bad taste and maybe half the stuff that's in it.
[00:39:05.332 --> 00:39:16.340]  The burky, black burky element cuts it all out, folks, to low detectable levels, electron microscopes, a week after water is put through it, can find nothing
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:21.461]  It is so important to get this unit.
[00:39:21.981 --> 00:39:29.463]  It is so important to have some storable foods, to have some firearms, to have some gold, to have your water filters.
[00:39:29.543 --> 00:39:33.344]  It's just an insurance policy for terrorism or disaster or depression.
[00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:37.445]  But all of that aside, the stuff that's in the water supplies.
[00:39:38.451 --> 00:39:41.556]  Once you've been drinking filtered water, you cannot drink tap water.
[00:39:41.596 --> 00:39:42.417]  It tastes horrible!
[00:39:42.778 --> 00:39:46.584]  You don't know what you've been drinking until you start drinking quality water.
[00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:51.071]  Debbie, how do folks call, what are the different specials?
[00:39:51.744 --> 00:39:55.465]  Well, we have the Berkey Light without the lights for $199.
[00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:58.707]  The lights are an optional feature.
[00:39:58.747 --> 00:40:01.668]  They don't have anything to do with processing your water.
[00:40:02.028 --> 00:40:06.710]  But they're a great emergency source of having lighting should your power go out.
[00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:10.051]  A huge LED array that burns for 14 years continuously.
[00:40:10.071 --> 00:40:13.292]  You can also buy a little solar panel that goes with it with the rechargeable batteries.
[00:40:13.632 --> 00:40:13.892]  Right.
[00:40:14.273 --> 00:40:18.134]  So, if you get the Berkey Light without the lights, it's $199.
[00:40:18.214 --> 00:40:20.315]  And with that, you get one free gift.
[00:40:21.132 --> 00:40:24.435]  And if you get the Berkey Light with the lights, you get two free gifts.
[00:40:24.535 --> 00:40:37.605]  And the gifts are either the Berkey Sport Bottles, which is a 22-ounce hand-held filtered water bottle, or you can get a bottle of potassium iodate, which is 200 tablets.
[00:40:37.686 --> 00:40:39.867]  It's 100 days' worth for one person.
[00:40:40.828 --> 00:40:44.231]  Or you can get the Video Sheltering in Place, which is a
[00:40:45.233 --> 00:40:49.075]  I have a preparedness video on how to set your house up in case of emergency.
[00:40:49.136 --> 00:40:50.016]  Made by a U.S.
[00:40:50.056 --> 00:40:50.977]  government specialist.
[00:40:51.077 --> 00:40:53.779]  And it's not the government's job to protect you and they can't.
[00:40:54.099 --> 00:40:56.660]  It's your job to learn this stuff to empower yourself.
[00:40:57.261 --> 00:40:58.562]  Give Debbie a call.
[00:40:58.682 --> 00:41:02.244]  We've got a bunch of other specialists as well.
[00:41:02.264 --> 00:41:02.644]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:41:03.205 --> 00:41:04.245]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[00:41:04.385 --> 00:41:09.809]  Okay, and then the fourth item is the prudent place is CD-ROM.
[00:41:10.638 --> 00:41:12.238]  And the prudent place is CD-ROM.
[00:41:12.258 --> 00:41:14.359]  We're getting lots of good response on that.
[00:41:14.479 --> 00:41:17.860]  It works on Macintosh or regular computers.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:28.322]  And it's got lists of places to live, safe places, bad places, different water, lightning strikes, all the different... Maps to everything in the country.
[00:41:29.362 --> 00:41:31.163]  It's a cornucopia of knowledge.
[00:41:34.017 --> 00:41:43.443]  888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com and tell them in the comment section it's an Alex Jones special to get these savings and what free gift you want.
[00:41:43.723 --> 00:41:45.764]  Berkeywater.com or Infowars.com.
[00:41:45.805 --> 00:41:48.826]  You can order there too on the shopping cart.
[00:41:49.887 --> 00:41:50.728]  Or 1-888-803-4438.
[00:41:51.028 --> 00:41:52.068]  Debbie, thanks for joining us.
[00:41:52.228 --> 00:41:52.929]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:54.050]  I had a question for you.
[00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:54.430]  Sure.
[00:41:54.955 --> 00:41:58.817]  Are you going to be on Coast to Coast the full time or just part of the time?
[00:41:58.917 --> 00:42:01.719]  Yeah, I was just on 30 Minutes last night with a bunch of other guests.
[00:42:01.999 --> 00:42:05.781]  Tonight I'm on the last three hours.
[00:42:06.001 --> 00:42:07.022]  The last three hours?
[00:42:07.682 --> 00:42:09.744]  Well, I'm going to try and stay up and listen.
[00:42:11.445 --> 00:42:14.566]  Alright, well, call in, Debbie.
[00:42:14.606 --> 00:42:15.427]  I'll be talking to you.
[00:42:15.527 --> 00:42:17.708]  Okay, if I can make it.
[00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:18.289]  Alrighty.
[00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:18.969]  Thank you.
[00:42:18.989 --> 00:42:21.310]  I look forward to hearing from your listeners.
[00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:22.151]  Thanks, Debbie.
[00:42:22.171 --> 00:42:22.411]  Bye.
[00:42:23.534 --> 00:42:29.258]  Yeah, they're trying to kill me, folks, because I was up last night on the show and I'll be up again tonight on the show.
[00:42:29.298 --> 00:42:30.359]  I'm totally honored.
[00:42:31.199 --> 00:42:33.581]  It'll be great to be able to get on there and talk about the issues.
[00:42:34.021 --> 00:42:35.482]  In fact, what did I talk about on the show?
[00:42:38.504 --> 00:42:41.586]  Staged election, skull and bones.
[00:42:43.247 --> 00:42:46.289]  They have a super majority in the House and the Senate.
[00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:48.691]  They have the Legislative.
[00:42:49.406 --> 00:42:53.509]  They have the Judicial, they have the Executive, they have 30 plus of the State Governors.
[00:42:55.910 --> 00:43:14.183]  And so look for the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the Super Patriot Act 2, National ID Card, Total Information Awareness, Mega Police State Bill, the Total Amnesty, Total Open Borders, and Bush is a lame duck, he's sure to sign the Assault Weapons Ban, and he puts Conservatives back to sleep.
[00:43:15.347 --> 00:43:18.489]  And then we have all these Bush administration officials saying, we owe Bin Laden.
[00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:19.430]  Thanks, Bin Laden!
[00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:21.631]  Boy, Americans thought we'd cower in fear.
[00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:28.876]  Folks, they did focus groups knowing that if Bin Laden threatened us, they even did these focus groups, that everybody would rally around, and so he appeared.
[00:43:29.917 --> 00:43:37.282]  Just like all these John Wayne and Steve McQueen are now pitching Mustangs and fast food restaurants.
[00:43:37.302 --> 00:43:38.283]  You know, they're back from the dead.
[00:43:38.303 --> 00:43:42.986]  You can't tell us not them, but... Folks, totally fake.
[00:43:44.255 --> 00:43:50.218]  Meanwhile, looking forward, we're going to have Hillary Clinton in 08, with Arnold running against her, and you'll vote for Arnold.
[00:43:52.219 --> 00:43:53.020]  Unbelievable.
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:59.884]  And remember, 34% of the country at least was on these electronic voting machines with no record of how you voted, and they say, just trust us.
[00:44:00.764 --> 00:44:07.348]  And we have exit polls showing the opposite, showing Kerry winning in all these places, but the voting machines said, no, no, no.
[00:44:08.351 --> 00:44:10.412]  And again, folks, I'm not for Kerry winning.
[00:44:10.452 --> 00:44:12.173]  I'd be just as depressed if Kerry had won.
[00:44:12.533 --> 00:44:16.975]  Maybe a little less, because then conservatives would say, I'm not for the free trade area.
[00:44:17.055 --> 00:44:18.056]  I'm not for gun control.
[00:44:18.096 --> 00:44:19.016]  I'm not for open borders.
[00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:20.037]  I'm not for UNESCO.
[00:44:20.617 --> 00:44:22.038]  I'm not for all of this.
[00:44:22.118 --> 00:44:23.198]  But now they will.
[00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:24.699]  Now they will.
[00:44:24.719 --> 00:44:25.379]  They're going to love it.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.900]  Because it isn't about the issues.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:32.402]  It's about feeling like you're part of the power structure with George W. Joining us is Paul Watson.
[00:44:32.422 --> 00:44:36.865]  Thanks for holding the last ten minutes while I talked to that caller in Debbie and covered that news.
[00:44:37.185 --> 00:44:37.465]  Paul?
[00:44:38.306 --> 00:44:39.706]  Lord Bush, it looks like it's our winner.
[00:44:39.746 --> 00:44:54.170]  Now, if Ohio goes to Kerry, when all these people who were challenged get their votes counted, it could go 269-269 to the House of Reps, but still, that'll be George W., so what do you say about all this?
[00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:56.231]  Well, here's the update.
[00:44:56.311 --> 00:45:02.093]  Kerry called Bush 10 minutes ago and he conceded, so officially, Bush has won.
[00:45:02.573 --> 00:45:03.833]  Oh, give us the details, please.
[00:45:04.953 --> 00:45:06.714]  Well, yeah, it's just come out in the Associated Press.
[00:45:07.236 --> 00:45:09.057]  Kerry is called Bush.
[00:45:09.117 --> 00:45:10.778]  They had a five-minute conversation.
[00:45:10.818 --> 00:45:12.259]  Kerry conceded Ohio.
[00:45:12.859 --> 00:45:14.200]  So Bush has won the election.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:21.744]  Kerry's sworn in in the same coffin two years earlier than Bush.
[00:45:21.784 --> 00:45:23.225]  Two years later, Bush is sworn in.
[00:45:23.565 --> 00:45:24.306]  Same coffin.
[00:45:24.826 --> 00:45:26.687]  I believe this was staged all along.
[00:45:26.747 --> 00:45:27.768]  Completely staged, Paul.
[00:45:28.668 --> 00:45:36.333]  Well, if you look at the body language and the kind of rhetoric the day before the election, you know, Bush came out in Reuters and said, we will win.
[00:45:36.914 --> 00:45:40.015]  And he looked at his body language, he was completely confident.
[00:45:40.075 --> 00:45:41.536]  Kerry didn't seem confident.
[00:45:42.496 --> 00:45:46.698]  So, I think he was staged, but, um, Kerry's just called Bush.
[00:45:46.718 --> 00:45:49.239]  I wouldn't be surprised if Bush had just called Bin Laden.
[00:45:49.519 --> 00:45:57.022]  Because obviously, up until October 29th, I wasn't aware of the fact that Bush would be running on a Bush-Bin Laden ticket.
[00:45:57.342 --> 00:45:58.882]  So that's why I said Kerry.
[00:45:59.543 --> 00:46:03.384]  Um, and here I am, on the air, admitting I'm wrong, but, um,
[00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:12.359]  I remember actually saying, as I said to you before the show, obviously that it would be Kerry unless Bin Laden popped up in October.
[00:46:12.399 --> 00:46:15.602]  Well, yeah, you even wrote a news article saying that, and he did pop up.
[00:46:16.483 --> 00:46:18.926]  A little gift, Karl Rove said, from Bin Laden.
[00:46:18.986 --> 00:46:20.808]  I mean, how arrogant do these people have to get?
[00:46:22.149 --> 00:46:25.753]  Well, exactly, and I mean, we go back to the Cornell University study.
[00:46:26.621 --> 00:46:31.163]  Where terror alerts equate to a 2.5% approval percentage increase.
[00:46:31.943 --> 00:46:35.985]  You know, take that away from Bush in Florida and Ohio and Kerry would take it.
[00:46:36.806 --> 00:46:43.669]  So again, I mean, as basic social identity theory, as those studies prove, you create the boogeyman, rally the leader around.
[00:46:44.389 --> 00:46:46.150]  And that's what happens.
[00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:55.674]  But the bottom line is, last night as the result was still in the balance, by the way I was pretty good with my predictions on the night, I called
[00:46:56.365 --> 00:46:59.426]  Florida and Ohio for Bush hours before anyone else did.
[00:47:00.047 --> 00:47:10.191]  So the bottom line is that Tom Brokaw was on NBC with guests sniggering about the fact that the White House will still be controlled by Skull and Bones whoever wins.
[00:47:11.051 --> 00:47:12.312]  So that's the bottom line on it.
[00:47:12.372 --> 00:47:14.453]  That's right, I got a bunch of calls about that.
[00:47:14.553 --> 00:47:15.894]  George Norrie was talking about that.
[00:47:15.914 --> 00:47:17.054]  I hope we can get that on tape.
[00:47:17.114 --> 00:47:19.375]  Yeah, whoever wins, Skull and Bones wins.
[00:47:19.555 --> 00:47:20.215]  Uh-huh.
[00:47:21.796 --> 00:47:23.897]  And so now, you know, what do we have in store?
[00:47:24.617 --> 00:47:25.878]  Newsmax has got an article
[00:47:26.587 --> 00:47:29.389]  Hillary 2008 already in gear.
[00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:37.116]  The outcome of yesterday's presidential election could determine whether Senator Hillary Clinton will have a chance to return her family to the White House.
[00:47:37.216 --> 00:47:44.902]  A victory by President Bush could establish New York's junior senator as the front runner for the 2008 Democratic nomination for president.
[00:47:45.022 --> 00:47:48.525]  And we wonder how they're going to catapult Arnold in, how they're going to get Americans
[00:47:49.255 --> 00:47:51.876]  Well, I've been proven far better at picking the candidates than the actual winner.
[00:48:11.127 --> 00:48:18.468]  Yeah, and so, you know, in 08 you have a limited number of combinations, all of which entail someone with Nazi connections being in the White House.
[00:48:18.969 --> 00:48:26.350]  So it's either going to be Jeb Bush vs. Hillary, Jeb Bush vs. Edward, Ernie vs. Hillary, or Ernie vs. Edward.
[00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:35.892]  And Hillary and Edward are, you know, far too weak to win an election against anyone, so you have a guaranteed Nazi, or, you know, a Royal Dynasty back in the White House.
[00:48:37.685 --> 00:48:50.050]  And, I mean, the Constitution could even get amended to the same situation here in Britain, where Blair is likely to take a third term for another four years, which, you know, Bush could go for three in a row if that happens.
[00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:53.992]  Yeah, it says Blair's going to call a snap election.
[00:48:54.972 --> 00:48:56.033]  In February, yeah.
[00:48:56.073 --> 00:48:59.734]  So he's still got the right amount of support.
[00:48:59.814 --> 00:49:01.855]  Nobody supports the Tories anymore, really.
[00:49:01.915 --> 00:49:06.117]  So, I mean, Blair's basically a shoo-in already, so he's going to call it early.
[00:49:08.231 --> 00:49:14.994]  Well, you know, while all the neocons are running around jibbering, smiling, oh, we're so powerful, Bush is in.
[00:49:15.955 --> 00:49:29.481]  Again, folks, there has never been in modern history a majority with one party with this many seats in the House, the Senate, 7 of the 9 Supreme Court Justices, the Executive, 30 plus of the Governors,
[00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:38.393]  If they were real conservatives, I would expect to see the borders controlled, the end of these gun laws, out of the UN.
[00:49:38.713 --> 00:49:44.955]  Instead, we're going in the opposite direction, but conservatives don't care because it's George W. Well, exactly.
[00:49:44.995 --> 00:49:46.415]  I mean, we analyzed it before.
[00:49:47.055 --> 00:49:52.036]  W. and Kerry had the same policies on at least 14 key domestic foreign policy issues.
[00:49:52.957 --> 00:49:53.237]  Bush,
[00:49:54.907 --> 00:50:01.731]  Increased the funding to the tune of around 400 million dollars to UN abortion agencies.
[00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:05.713]  And there's just been a big vote in the Senate which did the same thing as well.
[00:50:05.733 --> 00:50:08.294]  Actually, specifically funding the forced abortions?
[00:50:09.175 --> 00:50:16.779]  The forced abortions, yeah, while taking away, you know, a pittance from kind of international family planning, meanwhile funneling 400 million.
[00:50:18.098 --> 00:50:19.660]  Into the U.N.
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.320]  forced abortion?
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:21.561]  Well, that's the smoke and mirrors.
[00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:24.965]  You know, say, not for the International Criminal Court, but covertly sign on to it.
[00:50:26.486 --> 00:50:28.668]  Well, yeah, and that's what it's going to be for the next four years.
[00:50:28.708 --> 00:50:34.114]  I mean, they're going to start with a limited draft of skilled medical workers.
[00:50:34.134 --> 00:50:37.337]  They've already got a backdoor draft with the Stop Loss Program.
[00:50:38.416 --> 00:50:48.240]  And so, rather than a large-scale terror attack, I think they're going to go for soft targets towards, you know, the end of next year, and then we will see a widespread draft gradually phased in.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.560]  We'll come back, Paul.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.681]  We'll take a few calls.
[00:50:51.721 --> 00:50:53.381]  And we've got Bob Harris coming up.
[00:50:53.561 --> 00:50:54.562]  Everybody stay with us.
[00:50:54.602 --> 00:50:55.702]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:55.722 --> 00:50:58.523]  Covering Election 04, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:51:01.423 --> 00:51:02.984]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.144 --> 00:51:06.207]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.347 --> 00:51:10.250]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:14.534]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.874 --> 00:51:18.657]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.797 --> 00:51:20.639]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.819 --> 00:51:24.122]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.142 --> 00:51:25.243]  The medical bills!
[00:51:26.904 --> 00:51:28.845]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.005 --> 00:51:32.047]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.227 --> 00:51:35.089]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:41.694]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.234 --> 00:51:46.015]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:52:02.721 --> 00:52:13.424]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:13.784 --> 00:52:18.325]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:52:18.385 --> 00:52:29.729]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:37.151]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:37.551 --> 00:52:39.692]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:52:40.192 --> 00:52:45.173]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.

[00:53:00.037 --> 00:53:02.359]  I think so.
[00:53:17.555 --> 00:53:18.215]  We're good to go.

[00:54:08.519 --> 00:54:11.400]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:54:13.081 --> 00:54:14.381]  No excuses!
[00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:17.702]  The Republicans have control of everything!
[00:54:18.062 --> 00:54:24.004]  The states, the courts, the presidency, the Congress.
[00:54:24.505 --> 00:54:25.265]  No excuse!
[00:54:25.785 --> 00:54:30.867]  But instead of an age of conservatism, the age of the American Union, the end of your freedom,
[00:54:31.553 --> 00:54:34.094]  And a satellite tracker transponder in every car.
[00:54:34.435 --> 00:54:37.356]  Not a chicken in every pot, but a tracker in every car, every cell phone.
[00:54:37.776 --> 00:54:38.797]  A new tax for you.
[00:54:39.277 --> 00:54:43.139]  We're about to go to Rob and Bert and Joe and Ron and Mike and Greg and everybody else.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.981]  Paul Watson riding a shotgun with us.
[00:54:46.981 --> 00:54:48.062]  Bev Harris coming up.

[00:55:26.142 --> 00:55:27.062]  Each additional copy $5.95.
[00:55:27.882 --> 00:55:29.843]  Get them as gifts.
[00:55:29.883 --> 00:55:30.943]  Give them out to everybody.

[00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:03.812]  I don't know how long we're going to have these prices on the videos themselves, the hard copies of them.
[00:56:03.832 --> 00:56:05.372]  So go buy them today.
[00:56:06.175 --> 00:56:06.495]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:06.816 --> 00:56:13.240]  Paul Watson, let's go to some calls.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.021]  Let's go to Rob in Tennessee.
[00:56:15.101 --> 00:56:16.082]  Rob, you're on the air.
[00:56:16.122 --> 00:56:16.462]  Welcome.
[00:56:18.363 --> 00:56:19.184]  Hello, Rob.
[00:56:19.204 --> 00:56:21.526]  Hey, this isn't Rob, but I'd like to say thank you, Rob.
[00:56:21.546 --> 00:56:22.566]  Okay, well, who is this, then?
[00:56:22.586 --> 00:56:23.307]  This is Greg in Texas.
[00:56:23.707 --> 00:56:24.588]  Greg in Texas.
[00:56:25.028 --> 00:56:28.090]  Thanks for your hard work, and you need to take a deep breath once in a while.
[00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:35.455]  But earlier, Manny asked you a question, and I'm not sure if you wanted to address it or you didn't think so since you're on the radio, but
[00:56:35.851 --> 00:56:42.837]  Now, what can we do, since the electronics are getting deeper and deeper, and how do you ask somebody that goes against 98% of the public concerns?
[00:56:43.237 --> 00:56:47.501]  Please address that, if you would, or maybe direct us in a subtle way.
[00:56:48.362 --> 00:56:49.403]  Well, thank you.
[00:56:49.463 --> 00:56:51.044]  No, I'll direct you in a direct way.
[00:56:51.124 --> 00:56:52.585]  I don't quite get that point.
[00:56:53.146 --> 00:56:54.427]  And, you know, I can't settle down.
[00:56:55.108 --> 00:57:00.092]  Governments are forcing their workers to take implantable chips now in several countries.
[00:57:01.433 --> 00:57:01.813]  Publicly.
[00:57:02.494 --> 00:57:03.555]  They're getting rid of our borders.
[00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:06.090]  They're openly getting ready for national drafts.
[00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:10.313]  I mean, this is all happening.
[00:57:10.954 --> 00:57:18.540]  Yeah, 98% in Houston, 93% in Austin are against every major road being turned into a toll road with transponder chips federally funded dragging.
[00:57:18.561 --> 00:57:19.862]  It's a federal plan.
[00:57:20.142 --> 00:57:23.184]  And why do the mayors laugh at us and say, vote us out, ha ha ha?
[00:57:23.725 --> 00:57:26.307]  Because the hard inner civics machines are in.
[00:57:26.788 --> 00:57:27.668]  This is the arrogance.
[00:57:27.688 --> 00:57:30.471]  We're going into a dictatorship with the illusion of freedom.
[00:57:31.051 --> 00:57:41.317]  And what you do is you wake people up, you have a paper recall petition to have a paper election to recall the electronic voting machines.
[00:57:41.617 --> 00:57:42.938]  Paul Watson comments.
[00:57:43.839 --> 00:57:51.163]  Yeah, well I've actually reposted the Cleveland Plain Deal article where the dive old CEO, Walden O'Dell in Ohio,
[00:57:51.977 --> 00:57:57.079]  That he was committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the President next year.
[00:57:57.099 --> 00:58:03.742]  So it doesn't matter if the exit polls showed Kerry winning by 10% in Ohio, because Goebbels on the job!
[00:58:03.862 --> 00:58:12.385]  Well yeah, and we had reports of people voting for Kerry, and then when the voting machine went to the summary screen it showed their vote as Bush.
[00:58:14.136 --> 00:58:30.462]  On the same subject, there's an article today out of a Russian website where this Russian election observer, we obviously don't agree with that, but you make a good point, that Americans need ID for any other right, the right to assembly, own a gun, right to travel, but they don't need an ID to vote.
[00:58:30.782 --> 00:58:35.444]  So in essence, you can go to as many polling stations as you want and vote as many times as you want.
[00:58:36.244 --> 00:58:40.366]  Well, the Democrats steal elections that way, the Republicans just own the machines.
[00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:42.431]  All right, stay there, Paul.
[00:58:42.451 --> 00:58:43.932]  We'll be back with Paul and your calls.
[00:58:44.313 --> 00:58:45.875]  Coming up a little bit later, Bob Harris.
[00:58:46.696 --> 00:58:48.799]  Powerful two hours still coming up.
[00:58:48.839 --> 00:58:50.380]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.442 --> 00:58:52.203]  Hello, folks.
[00:58:53.304 --> 00:58:54.385]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.352 --> 00:59:00.413]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.134 --> 00:59:02.214]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.875 --> 00:59:03.716]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.456 --> 00:59:05.377]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.038 --> 00:59:09.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.201 --> 00:59:14.304]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:25.726 --> 00:59:30.508]  Alright, my friends, into our number two.
[00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:43.254]  Just about 20 minutes ago, John Forbes Carey, Bush's cousin, Bush's skull and bones mate, who was a great thespian, deserves an Academy Award for the staged election, called his cousin and conceded.
[00:59:45.135 --> 00:59:48.117]  A lot of electronic voting machine fraud's gone on.
[00:59:48.557 --> 00:59:54.800]  The Republicans now control most of the governorships of the states, most of the state legislatures,
[00:59:55.852 --> 01:00:04.021]  They now control the executive, the judicial federally, and the legislative federally with the MAGA majorities in the House and Senate.
[01:00:04.762 --> 01:00:10.688]  So expect massive government, massive loss of liberty, massive socialism, and corporate cronyism.
[01:00:11.249 --> 01:00:17.175]  And it doesn't matter to conservatives, they worship Arnold Schwarzenegger, who makes Bill Clinton look like Ronald Reagan.
[01:00:19.759 --> 01:00:23.482]  So, uh, very, very, very serious.
[01:00:23.962 --> 01:00:25.043]  Dove Harris is coming up.
[01:00:25.063 --> 01:00:26.324]  We're talking to Paul Watson.
[01:00:27.464 --> 01:00:28.225]  Paul Watson?
[01:00:28.285 --> 01:00:37.011]  I mean, the Republicans in the last hundred years, in fact, before that, they haven't had a majority like this in the Congress since the Civil War.
[01:00:37.031 --> 01:00:40.594]  Uh, but, uh, I'm not holding my breath.
[01:00:40.694 --> 01:00:41.074]  I'm, in fact,
[01:00:42.307 --> 01:00:44.868]  I'm just bracing for massive government expansion.
[01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:50.591]  We've already seen that with him having a majority, but I guess Rush Limbaugh is going to be mum on the subject.
[01:00:51.751 --> 01:00:52.251]  Well, yeah.
[01:00:52.852 --> 01:00:56.073]  I mean, it's similar to Reagan, where he had a massive majority in 1980.
[01:00:56.573 --> 01:01:04.557]  And, you know, all the rhetoric was there, getting government out of people's personal lives, not sacrificing American sovereignty.
[01:01:05.357 --> 01:01:09.999]  But the fact is that the government grew at record levels, and Bush has even trumped that.
[01:01:11.041 --> 01:01:15.164]  And now we've got an article out of the Associated Press just in the last 40 minutes.
[01:01:15.784 --> 01:01:18.326]  Europe hopes for more amenable Bush.
[01:01:18.566 --> 01:01:30.353]  As President Bush edged close to an election victory, France, Germany and other European countries he alienated during his first four years promised Wednesday to work with the new US administration.
[01:01:31.214 --> 01:01:32.515]  And that's on stage.
[01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:34.496]  The people that own Europe own America.
[01:01:35.036 --> 01:01:37.738]  They just play an elaborate good cop, bad cop game.
[01:01:39.133 --> 01:01:39.553]  Well, yes.
[01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:59.431]  I mean, they could either just acquiesce to him or they could build up this fake push for left-wing world government to save us from the evil right-wing neocons, which, you know, if they run a strong candidate, if the Democrats do in four years, then that fake opposition will, you know, the muscle will have built it even more.
[01:02:00.192 --> 01:02:02.334]  Well, Paul, you have been updating until
[01:02:03.555 --> 01:02:04.879]  6, 7 in the morning your time.
[01:02:04.939 --> 01:02:06.042]  Got a few hours sleep.
[01:02:06.062 --> 01:02:06.924]  You've updated again.
[01:02:06.964 --> 01:02:09.270]  You're updating right now that Gary's conceded.
[01:02:10.163 --> 01:02:11.344]  You're going to get something to eat.
[01:02:11.364 --> 01:02:13.825]  You haven't eaten yet in the last 14 hours.
[01:02:13.845 --> 01:02:15.025]  Literally, folks.
[01:02:15.066 --> 01:02:15.986]  You've been working so hard.
[01:02:16.006 --> 01:02:19.087]  So get yourself some fish and chips over there.
[01:02:19.548 --> 01:02:28.732]  And then you're going to be joining us the last 30 minutes, the last 25 minutes in the third hour for new updates as our correspondent, tracking all this, doing a great job.
[01:02:29.473 --> 01:02:30.733]  So we'll talk to you then.
[01:02:31.213 --> 01:02:32.734]  Let's jam a call in right now.
[01:02:33.575 --> 01:02:34.675]  Burton, Ohio.
[01:02:34.795 --> 01:02:36.256]  Burt, how are you doing today?
[01:02:38.564 --> 01:02:39.825]  Go ahead, Burt, you're on the air.
[01:02:40.425 --> 01:02:41.265]  Yes, how are you doing?
[01:02:41.545 --> 01:02:42.706]  I've got a question.
[01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:44.627]  I'm in Southern Ohio.
[01:02:45.627 --> 01:02:50.029]  I voted for Michael Peruca, and there's a lot of other people that did the same.
[01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:53.371]  We didn't get no tolls at all from where the Constitution Party stands.
[01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:53.951]  That's right.
[01:02:54.051 --> 01:02:55.332]  Masses of people voted.
[01:02:55.432 --> 01:02:56.932]  Masses voted Libertarian.
[01:02:57.393 --> 01:03:02.675]  I talked personally to hundreds of people voting Libertarian, and it didn't even show up in the local Austin race.
[01:03:03.908 --> 01:03:06.311]  Yes sir, and I'm very disgusted with that.
[01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:16.441]  Another point that I wanted to bring up is I play your show at the shop every day with the other guys, and we're having a discussion about the same-sex marriage bill.
[01:03:16.701 --> 01:03:20.806]  Wouldn't this be a doorway to have them change a lot of Constitution amendments?
[01:03:21.086 --> 01:03:23.629]  Yeah, it's a doorway for a con-con.
[01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:26.532]  The flag-burning, the gay marriage, all that.
[01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.558]  They know those are issues that are important to people.
[01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:30.598]  It's not to the globalists.
[01:03:31.238 --> 01:03:35.620]  Once a con con opens, it's really to get rid of the 22nd Amendment for Lord Schwarzenegger.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:45.504]  Okay, and one other thing, uh, last comment I'd like to make is that your callers need to discern between someone who's passionate about what they believe in and someone who exaggerates.
[01:03:45.524 --> 01:03:48.806]  I believe your passion is what you believe in, and I support you.
[01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:49.806]  Thank you very much, sir.
[01:03:49.886 --> 01:03:50.366]  Well, thank you.
[01:03:50.406 --> 01:03:51.647]  We post everything we say.
[01:03:51.667 --> 01:03:52.067]  We'll be back.
[01:03:53.542 --> 01:03:57.884]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:02.486]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.646 --> 01:04:07.007]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.047 --> 01:04:08.408]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.228 --> 01:04:10.009]  Hammered!
[01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:14.434]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.474 --> 01:04:21.442]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.542 --> 01:04:23.545]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.905 --> 01:04:34.407]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.547 --> 01:04:39.928]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Take Three, is for you.
[01:04:40.428 --> 01:04:44.329]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.769]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:46.509]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:53.110 --> 01:05:01.720]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:07.707]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals,
[01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:13.209]  And they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:13.429 --> 01:05:16.090]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:22.892]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:23.032 --> 01:05:24.912]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:25.112 --> 01:05:31.134]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:37.036]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:05:37.376 --> 01:05:41.299]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.339 --> 01:05:42.039]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:42.059 --> 01:05:42.740]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.948 --> 01:05:55.429]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:05:55.649 --> 01:06:02.995]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:06:03.295 --> 01:06:07.718]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:06:07.979 --> 01:06:17.826]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:06:18.567 --> 01:06:22.251]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:25.054]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:06:25.074 --> 01:06:31.301]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:33.063]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:06:33.363 --> 01:06:34.244]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:37.326]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:06:37.486 --> 01:06:40.649]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:44.011]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:48.174]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:06:48.315 --> 01:06:49.315]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:06:53.298 --> 01:06:58.362]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.743 --> 01:07:01.004]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:08.578]  I want to make things absolutely crystal clear.
[01:07:13.182 --> 01:07:16.124]  I don't like John Forbes Kerry.
[01:07:17.145 --> 01:07:18.506]  I have been a Republican.
[01:07:18.666 --> 01:07:19.707]  Everybody knows that.
[01:07:20.728 --> 01:07:26.333]  About six years ago, I quit promoting a Republican party because they're a pack of traitors.
[01:07:27.934 --> 01:07:29.796]  Democrats, we know what we're dealing with.
[01:07:29.816 --> 01:07:31.097]  A bunch of communists.
[01:07:31.117 --> 01:07:32.118]  A bunch of socialists.
[01:07:32.887 --> 01:07:39.732]  But when Republicans, they tell us they're against big government, while taking our liberties, expanding government at record levels.
[01:07:41.193 --> 01:07:59.265]  Bush, and now this will be proved even more for you, Bush has a record in modern history, control of the House, picked up a bunch of seats, record control of the Senate, massive majority, 30 plus of the governorships of the states,
[01:08:00.621 --> 01:08:04.004]  Seven of the nine members of the Supreme Court appointed by Republicans.
[01:08:05.646 --> 01:08:10.330]  It's a lame-duck presidency, which means that Bush isn't facing re-election.
[01:08:11.371 --> 01:08:14.574]  We could see the repeal of Roe v. Wade.
[01:08:15.595 --> 01:08:18.437]  We could see the repeal of all these gun laws.
[01:08:18.477 --> 01:08:20.619]  We could see the Tenth Amendment put back in place.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.581]  We could see control of our border.
[01:08:23.862 --> 01:08:26.765]  We could see Bush pull out of UNESCO, which he signed back onto.
[01:08:27.463 --> 01:08:31.546]  We could see the end of all this corporate cronyism, you're not going to see that.
[01:08:32.046 --> 01:08:40.733]  If you think the doubling in the growth of government was bad, under Bush, what it was under Clinton, if you think all of this was bad, brace yourselves, it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:08:41.193 --> 01:08:46.377]  You're going to see the free trade area of the Americas, which is the Pan-American Union, the American Union.
[01:08:47.118 --> 01:08:48.899]  You're going to see the new Super Patriot Act.
[01:08:49.837 --> 01:09:02.951]  Homeland Security expansion with the Total Information Awareness Network and the National ID Card to have a job anywhere over every job, every economy, sector, total open borders, total amnesty.
[01:09:04.733 --> 01:09:12.622]  You're going to see it all and you're going to love it because at least you'll have that George W. sticker on your car and you'll feel like a winner.
[01:09:15.106 --> 01:09:18.107]  There's no way Kerry would have gotten away with all of this.
[01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:36.053]  There is no way an exit polls all over the country, with this record voter turnout of Democrats and new voters, show that Kerry was winning, but just like in key states where Howard Dean was winning on non-Diebold machines, he was losing by 10 points on the Diebold machines.
[01:09:36.213 --> 01:09:43.676]  And the owner of Diebold, based in Ohio, or Diebold, said, we will deliver, we are committed to delivering the electoral votes to Bush,
[01:09:44.605 --> 01:09:45.926]  And it happened, folks.
[01:09:46.646 --> 01:09:48.747]  And again, we're not for Kerry!
[01:09:48.807 --> 01:09:50.348]  We're just stating the facts.
[01:09:51.028 --> 01:09:52.309]  And Kerry rolled over.
[01:09:52.769 --> 01:09:54.590]  It was staged at that level as well.
[01:09:55.450 --> 01:10:02.534]  Kerry rolled over to this, and now they're submitting the electronic voting machines that I guess in four years will be in at 100% of the country.
[01:10:02.814 --> 01:10:09.277]  Joining us is Bev Harris, blackboxvoting.org, who was on Coast to Coast AM with myself, of course, last night as well.
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.923]  And I know she's tired, but we're honored to have her.
[01:10:13.103 --> 01:10:15.405]  And Bev, you've been tracking this.
[01:10:15.505 --> 01:10:16.706]  Good to have you on with us.
[01:10:17.807 --> 01:10:18.528]  Good to be here.
[01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.851]  What's your take on what happened?
[01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:30.581]  Well, you know, I hate to say it, but I so knew this was going to happen that I actually didn't even watch TV last night.
[01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:39.846]  I was sitting at my computer at 8.30 Pacific Time launching the biggest Freedom of Information Act request blip in history.
[01:10:40.066 --> 01:10:40.746]  Because I knew.
[01:10:41.187 --> 01:10:49.151]  The only way to get transparency back into the process is to use what remaining protections we have for the time being
[01:10:50.545 --> 01:10:52.106]  And go get those records.
[01:10:52.406 --> 01:10:54.287]  Go to runfoxvoting.org.
[01:10:54.307 --> 01:10:58.550]  You'll see exactly what we submitted to every single county in the United States.
[01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:19.623]  Well, Kerry about 45 minutes ago, uh, 35 minutes ago, capitulated to his cousin Bush, and of the Royal Bloodline, and folks, understand, Kerry could have challenged a whole bunch of states clearly from the evidence, uh, have the election stolen again,
[01:11:20.763 --> 01:11:22.484]  And he's not challenging it, Bev!
[01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:23.724]  Showing this is staged!
[01:11:25.384 --> 01:11:26.625]  He's not challenging it.
[01:11:26.745 --> 01:11:32.887]  I can think of one possible benign explanation for that, but it seems a little remote.
[01:11:33.087 --> 01:11:41.409]  I think there could possibly be a law enforcement thing going on, and I have a couple of reasons to believe that it could be.
[01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:50.372]  And if that's the case, there might be advantages to him conceding the race and then going there and they just swoop in and arrest some people.
[01:11:51.184 --> 01:11:53.986]  Now, that's the only possible explanation I can give for it.
[01:11:54.066 --> 01:11:54.246]  Arrested?
[01:11:54.266 --> 01:11:55.828]  Bev, what are you talking about?
[01:11:56.708 --> 01:12:19.726]  Well, I visited with law enforcement people on Monday, and I reported some severe situations to the FBI, and actually I was interviewed by the FBI and a couple of other levels of different law enforcement about some information I brought forward about hacking in through the modems, but it appeared very likely it was going to happen.
[01:12:20.678 --> 01:12:28.544]  And at one point, you know Alex, I always say things here that I haven't said elsewhere anywhere publicly.
[01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:43.014]  At one point it became obvious that when I was dealing at the federal level with certain law enforcement types, that they were very uncomfortable that I had given the information to some other law enforcement agencies.
[01:12:43.675 --> 01:12:47.377]  Now that could be because they might... Let me take a wild guess.
[01:12:47.417 --> 01:12:49.419]  The FBI kind of told you to shut your mouth.
[01:12:50.245 --> 01:13:01.452]  Well, not exactly, but they were very concerned about what other agencies knew, and clearly uncomfortable with the fact I had gone to other agencies.
[01:13:01.892 --> 01:13:10.077]  And that could mean they were involved in a sting, and I was mucking it up, or it could mean they didn't want it out there.
[01:13:10.277 --> 01:13:12.479]  They're not involved in a sting, my dear.
[01:13:14.087 --> 01:13:17.250]  Well, I'm trying to think of any benign reason.
[01:13:18.491 --> 01:13:20.453]  So, how many agencies you tell about this?
[01:13:20.473 --> 01:13:22.294]  At least four.
[01:13:24.815 --> 01:13:38.064]  Yeah, I mean, we're talking about the FBI that drove off the three of the black boxes from the World Trade Center with cops and firefighters watching and then declaring that there were no black boxes, and then we're talking about the same FBI that grabbed all the videos from the hotels and gas stations around the Pentagon.
[01:13:38.324 --> 01:13:43.247]  We're talking about the same FBI that grabbed the videotapes from Oklahoma City showing McVeigh with Arabs.
[01:13:43.828 --> 01:13:47.870]  We're talking about the same FBI that cooked the bomb and trained the driver in the first World Trade Center bombing.
[01:13:48.631 --> 01:13:50.392]  Is it that FBI we're talking about, Bev?
[01:13:51.144 --> 01:14:02.409]  It is, and let me tell you, while we're speaking of Curiouser and Curiouser, there are some computer scientists who have put themselves forward as experts in the voting field.
[01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:17.917]  People will know their names, I won't say it on the air, but what's interesting to me is they knew about the extreme vulnerability of the modems 11 months ago, and instead chose to divert attention over to touch screens.
[01:14:18.582 --> 01:14:22.086]  And the idea that, ooh, you could go vote twice with a smart card.
[01:14:22.446 --> 01:14:29.914]  Well, hello, you could also dial into the central server and own the computer in 50 places at once or 500 places at once.
[01:14:29.974 --> 01:14:36.401]  And there's been examples of this with major voting machine company employees who have felony backgrounds already.
[01:14:37.552 --> 01:14:50.440]  We now know this can be done, and my question is, has this not been brought forward by certain of the people who profess to be experts in the field, because I know now that they knew.
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:15:00.807]  And if they knew it 11 months ago, again, I'm searching, I'm really searching for a reason that's a good reason not to tell the public last January.
[01:15:03.129 --> 01:15:04.350]  And again, I'm no fan of Kerry.
[01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:05.130]  Let's make that clear.
[01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:07.411]  But I am for who is elected being elected.
[01:15:08.391 --> 01:15:09.272]  Exactly.
[01:15:09.432 --> 01:15:09.952]  I don't care.
[01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:12.533]  Let's go over this though.
[01:15:12.753 --> 01:15:13.693]  I mean, let's go over this.
[01:15:14.234 --> 01:15:20.476]  Exit polls were showing him winning by large margins and then the machines would say that he lost.
[01:15:21.096 --> 01:15:22.617]  And then Kerry doesn't challenge that?
[01:15:24.598 --> 01:15:25.278]  It's amazing.
[01:15:25.518 --> 01:15:29.800]  And there are some situations where it's obvious that the machines were tampered with.
[01:15:30.679 --> 01:15:47.066]  Sixth district in Minnesota, we got screenshots of a situation where you had a Bush lead and then Kerry behind him and then you had every minor candidate, including Wrighton, got 8,100 and some votes.
[01:15:48.466 --> 01:15:49.867]  It doesn't happen that way, folks.
[01:15:50.167 --> 01:15:57.030]  What was happening was somebody was diverting votes over to all the minor candidates and they didn't do it very skillfully.
[01:15:58.766 --> 01:16:05.832]  Well, yeah, and you've got a small cadre of technicians dialing in with the codes from Lanley, Virginia, and it's a lot of work, you know?
[01:16:06.993 --> 01:16:16.240]  You have to clean it up later, and they have removed that from the website now, but it was officially on the Secretary of State's website, which is why you don't want to just go there and look at a page.
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.722]  You want to capture a screenshot when you see an anomaly.
[01:16:18.762 --> 01:16:21.865]  And you also want to get it from a government agency, not a news source.
[01:16:22.085 --> 01:16:29.211]  What about the Rocky Mountain News coming out the day before the election and projecting Bush as the winner and then not saying why they posted that.
[01:16:29.491 --> 01:16:30.692]  We have screenshots of that.
[01:16:31.213 --> 01:16:36.137]  And then on top of it, the Green Bay running the AP Bush wins three weeks ago.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.401]  You know what Alex, you know some things I haven't seen.
[01:16:41.421 --> 01:16:44.904]  I've been so much nose to the grindstone, I've missed some of these gems.
[01:16:46.886 --> 01:16:47.767]  Well, there's so many.
[01:16:48.681 --> 01:16:49.882]  Well, that is true, too.
[01:16:49.962 --> 01:16:56.067]  I mean, you know, in Philadelphia, there were 2,000 votes on the machines before the polls opened for some curious reason.
[01:16:58.149 --> 01:17:02.613]  And you get a receipt when you buy a stick of bubble gum for five cents.
[01:17:03.373 --> 01:17:04.594]  When you go to the bank, you get it.
[01:17:04.835 --> 01:17:06.576]  But these companies say, just trust us.
[01:17:06.616 --> 01:17:07.557]  There can't be a record.
[01:17:07.597 --> 01:17:08.237]  Just shut up.
[01:17:08.938 --> 01:17:09.398]  Don't worry.
[01:17:09.438 --> 01:17:12.601]  We have lots of men in black uniforms and machine guns if you give us a problem.
[01:17:16.101 --> 01:17:20.824]  And remember, I'm in a county that has paper ballots, and this is my voting experience.
[01:17:20.884 --> 01:17:26.587]  I go, I fill out my ballot, I put it into a machine which sucks it away, and it ends up in this big black box.
[01:17:26.647 --> 01:17:30.869]  I kid you not, it's a big black box, which is, you know, about the size of a safe or a bank vault.
[01:17:31.549 --> 01:17:37.653]  And that's the last I see of that, because according to our state law, even in a recount, we can't look at that thing again.
[01:17:39.194 --> 01:17:41.875]  Well, it's very important that you not be able to check the voting.
[01:17:41.935 --> 01:17:43.816]  It's a sign of a free country.
[01:17:45.413 --> 01:17:47.875]  You know, there's only one way to get it back, folks.
[01:17:48.255 --> 01:17:50.456]  The officials are not going to give it back to us.
[01:17:50.536 --> 01:17:52.157]  We've got to go take it back.
[01:17:52.678 --> 01:18:01.243]  When you have a large opponent, and you are a small guy, as we are fighting against a bureaucracy, the way that you win is with, I call it, judo.
[01:18:01.303 --> 01:18:04.325]  You use the weight of your opponent against itself.
[01:18:04.505 --> 01:18:08.668]  In this case, the weight of a bureaucracy is in its own rules and regulations.
[01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:16.041]  So, you exploit the rules and regulations to get as much leverage as you can before they change the rules and regulations.
[01:18:18.364 --> 01:18:20.166]  Well, everybody knows it's a fraud.
[01:18:21.148 --> 01:18:26.475]  Everybody knows that suddenly when they put in the machines, politicians don't care what the people think or say anymore.
[01:18:27.518 --> 01:18:28.778]  The arrogance is rising.
[01:18:28.819 --> 01:18:29.659]  The tyranny is growing.
[01:18:29.699 --> 01:18:31.619]  When we get back, Bev, I want to talk about solutions.
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.220]  Ways to remove electronic voting machines.
[01:18:34.841 --> 01:18:39.862]  Ways to stop this cascade of the machines being federally paid for at the state level.
[01:18:40.603 --> 01:18:43.584]  And then we'll let you go after the next segment and we'll go to everybody's calls.
[01:18:44.204 --> 01:18:45.124]  Everybody stay with us.
[01:18:45.144 --> 01:18:46.165]  We're talking to Bev Harris.
[01:18:46.865 --> 01:18:47.665]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:18:47.725 --> 01:18:50.546]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[01:18:51.006 --> 01:18:52.747]  Her website is WhiteBoxVoting.org.
[01:18:54.028 --> 01:18:57.630]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:18:57.950 --> 01:19:01.472]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[01:19:01.752 --> 01:19:10.617]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.

[01:19:20.041 --> 01:19:21.402]  This detailed report will provide
[01:19:21.442 --> 01:19:22.062]  We're good to go.
[01:19:54.088 --> 01:19:54.848]  Terrorism!
[01:19:54.988 --> 01:19:55.749]  Terrorism!
[01:19:55.849 --> 01:20:01.912]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:20:02.172 --> 01:20:03.753]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:20:03.993 --> 01:20:06.474]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:20:06.874 --> 01:20:21.441]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:21.481 --> 01:20:21.801]  government.
[01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:23.782]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:20:24.142 --> 01:20:30.065]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:20:30.205 --> 01:20:34.707]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:23.370]  U.S.

[01:21:24.531 --> 01:21:25.652]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[01:21:25.812 --> 01:21:26.573]  Which are collectible?
[01:21:26.633 --> 01:21:27.353]  Which are bullion?

[01:21:52.831 --> 01:21:54.532]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:21:54.612 --> 01:21:56.814]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:21:56.974 --> 01:21:57.995]  It feels great.
[01:21:58.175 --> 01:21:59.176]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:21:59.296 --> 01:22:04.819]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:06.661]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:09.303]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:22:09.443 --> 01:22:12.625]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:22:12.745 --> 01:22:13.425]  Incredible!
[01:22:13.606 --> 01:22:14.826]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:22:14.866 --> 01:22:18.509]  I have a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:22:18.649 --> 01:22:19.450]  Well, that's for sure.
[01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:20.170]  Was it easy?
[01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:21.011]  Very easy.
[01:22:21.051 --> 01:22:21.951]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:27.155]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:33.639]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:22:33.979 --> 01:22:34.820]  Call right now.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:35.560]  1-800-622-THIN.
[01:22:36.221 --> 01:22:37.802]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:22:40.464 --> 01:22:45.347]  Remember, imagine you heard it right here and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[01:22:45.587 --> 01:22:46.788]  So call Vim and Vigor today.
[01:22:46.808 --> 01:22:46.968]  1-800-622-THIN.
[01:22:48.849 --> 01:22:49.989]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:22:50.009 --> 01:23:02.193]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:02.613 --> 01:23:05.794]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:08.855 --> 01:23:16.057]  White House officials, from card to robe and all over TV, print media saying, thanks for the gift Bin Laden,
[01:23:18.132 --> 01:23:20.434]  Oh, we want people to think about terror for this election.
[01:23:20.854 --> 01:23:25.497]  Well, yeah, we're going to be terrorized by this police state, whether John Kerry or George Bush won.
[01:23:26.677 --> 01:23:30.840]  Coming up the next time, we'll go directly to Ron and John and Fred and Alan and everybody else.
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:32.941]  A lot of calls from Ohio today.
[01:23:33.642 --> 01:23:44.708]  Kerry, of course, about an hour ago, capitulated to Lord Bush and said, yes, you are der Fuehrer, but not fighting very hard, despite all the evidence of election fraud.
[01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:45.809]  But Bev Harris,
[01:23:47.146 --> 01:24:09.164]  Is not the best way to fight this, to continue to educate people about the electronic voting machines, and show people the evidence of fraud, and then to have, at the state and county and city level, petitions, handwritten petitions, to then demand a paper ballot recall of the electronic voting machines, to then have them removed.
[01:24:09.885 --> 01:24:13.328]  Because if we don't stop this, it's over for this country.
[01:24:13.808 --> 01:24:15.830]  How do you see us getting these things removed?
[01:24:17.216 --> 01:24:22.861]  Well, my approach to getting them removed is going to focus on two things.
[01:24:23.182 --> 01:24:31.369]  Proving machine fraud, which we need, and we can do that when we get the FOIA request, the Freedom of Information request.
[01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:35.533]  We got just one in, in the last week, and it showed fraud!
[01:24:35.613 --> 01:24:36.213]  I mean, hello!
[01:24:36.654 --> 01:24:39.777]  And then, so we can prove that the machine
[01:24:40.419 --> 01:24:48.145]  Are fraudulent and the other aspect of it is proving that there was collusion and racketeering among some of the people who pushed these machines into being.
[01:24:48.585 --> 01:24:59.353]  I think the American people and even the Congress and the public officials who've refused to be cooperative with reform are going to have a hard time justifying and defending a system.
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:03.141]  That was put into place in an illicit way.
[01:25:03.481 --> 01:25:19.648]  Everybody I talk to, Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Constitution Party, Green Party, everybody hates these machines, knows that there should be a record, knows they're involved in fraud, but by the time it hits the nightly news is, there's been a few problems, but don't worry, the feds are fixing it.
[01:25:19.928 --> 01:25:23.009]  It's the feds that engineered this thing with a handful of companies.
[01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:26.910]  That's the funny thing, I knew it was going to be, oh,
[01:25:28.692 --> 01:25:30.353]  Well, everything went well.
[01:25:30.633 --> 01:25:32.615]  There was a few glitches here and there.
[01:25:33.015 --> 01:25:34.596]  It was easy and fun to vote.
[01:25:34.776 --> 01:25:37.418]  Contrary to what the naysayers said!
[01:25:38.119 --> 01:25:42.322]  Yes, well, and the truth is, and I've been saying this, I said this past week on your show,
[01:25:43.246 --> 01:25:51.096]  The truth is, you're not going to know if the machine counted remotely correctly until you do at least a minimal amount of auditing.
[01:25:51.556 --> 01:25:58.705]  And they haven't done any of it yet because the procedures for auditing don't even kick in until the 3rd through the 12th of November.
[01:25:58.865 --> 01:26:01.608]  And Kerry is not even challenging it.
[01:26:01.689 --> 01:26:02.750]  He's just capitulating.
[01:26:03.610 --> 01:26:05.691]  That's amazing to me that he capitulated.
[01:26:05.711 --> 01:26:17.155]  There's really no excuse for it because he knew and I can tell you that he has had black box voting, the book, handed to him personally, repeatedly.
[01:26:17.515 --> 01:26:21.897]  He has no reason not to know and he was looking every way but
[01:26:22.978 --> 01:26:29.781]  At these machines, he did nothing so ever to try to address procedures to solve this ahead of time.
[01:26:30.002 --> 01:26:35.124]  Bev, they're cousins, they're members of a 15 member each year intelligence organization.
[01:26:35.384 --> 01:26:36.745]  They swear an oath to each other.
[01:26:37.265 --> 01:26:38.326]  It was a staged event.
[01:26:38.366 --> 01:26:40.347]  It's like when a boxer takes a dive.
[01:26:41.427 --> 01:26:43.328]  I mean, I knew when Bush said, I'm not going to lose.
[01:26:43.809 --> 01:26:47.631]  And you know, that same arrogance, just total confidence.
[01:26:49.672 --> 01:26:50.392]  Well, yeah, I mean,
[01:26:51.711 --> 01:26:55.572]  Well, you know, how confident was I that that was going to happen?
[01:26:55.652 --> 01:26:57.793]  Like I say, I didn't even turn the TV on.
[01:26:57.853 --> 01:27:05.876]  I knew I was working on the next step already, because... And then people came in and said, well, this happened, and they were shocked and dismayed, and I'm like, good, you know what?
[01:27:05.916 --> 01:27:08.076]  We just sent out 3,000 FOIA requests.
[01:27:08.837 --> 01:27:10.577]  We are going to get it to the bottom of this.
[01:27:10.997 --> 01:27:13.658]  It isn't going to happen from officials taking this.
[01:27:13.858 --> 01:27:15.579]  The public has to help with this.
[01:27:16.267 --> 01:27:19.828]  And we have, remember, we own our records.
[01:27:20.148 --> 01:27:29.151]  Now it's very interesting to see what the public officials are doing because of course they all received these records requests right in the middle of last night.
[01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:31.872]  You can't file it until there is a record to request.
[01:27:32.757 --> 01:27:41.780]  Well, the state of Minnesota has already said they're going to drag their feet as long as possible and delay as long as possible, giving us the records that we're entitled to by law.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.921]  Yeah, so months from now, it'll be a minor footnote in a few papers.
[01:27:45.001 --> 01:27:46.422]  Okay, it was all fraud, so what?
[01:27:47.842 --> 01:27:49.123]  Well, not if I can help it.
[01:27:51.223 --> 01:27:55.965]  Bev, I mean, certainly you can see the new arrogance of government across the board.
[01:27:56.005 --> 01:28:01.947]  Wherever these machines go in, suddenly politicians who cared what the people thought literally laugh at us
[01:28:03.329 --> 01:28:13.239]  In the case of toll roads, record toll roads to go on transponders, 90 plus percent in the cities where this is going in, in Texas, are against it and the politicians literally laugh at us.
[01:28:14.577 --> 01:28:21.320]  Well, yeah, if you don't have to worry about being voted out of office, then you don't have to do anything anyone wants you to at all.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:27.243]  And we are seeing signs of this, where people just don't pay any attention at all, no matter how many people.
[01:28:27.503 --> 01:28:35.366]  I was at a town meeting where 196 of 200 people believed along the way, and the public officials just shrugged their shoulders.
[01:28:36.687 --> 01:28:38.088]  Bev Harris, thanks for joining us.
[01:28:38.408 --> 01:28:39.008]  God bless you.
[01:28:39.528 --> 01:28:39.948]  Thank you.
[01:28:39.968 --> 01:28:41.029]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.105 --> 01:28:45.026]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.506 --> 01:28:47.147]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.167 --> 01:28:50.829]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.731 --> 01:28:56.893]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[01:28:57.113 --> 01:28:59.554]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[01:28:59.814 --> 01:29:04.977]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[01:29:05.138 --> 01:29:05.838]  Well, no more.
[01:29:05.998 --> 01:29:08.960]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:12.462]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[01:29:12.722 --> 01:29:18.226]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[01:29:18.446 --> 01:29:20.988]  It's called hyaluronic acid or HA.
[01:29:21.268 --> 01:29:29.054]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[01:29:29.274 --> 01:29:32.476]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[01:29:32.677 --> 01:29:36.940]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:40.182]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[01:29:40.402 --> 01:29:42.964]  Call 1-800-707-3953 and get one bottle free when you buy two.
[01:29:43.025 --> 01:29:45.627]  Remember, call 1-800-707-3953 and get your free bottle of injuve when you buy two.
[01:29:45.647 --> 01:29:46.047]  Call today!
[01:29:53.679 --> 01:29:57.581]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:29:57.801 --> 01:30:03.243]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:30:03.503 --> 01:30:13.888]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:30:14.048 --> 01:30:18.390]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:19.371]  We're good to go!
[01:30:33.524 --> 01:30:33.924]  I think so.
[01:30:54.699 --> 01:31:02.861]  You love your pet, and when your dog or cat starts to suffer from the debilitating effects of arthritis, you want to do everything possible to bring back their energy and spirit.
[01:31:03.081 --> 01:31:10.383]  Now, both you and your pet can benefit from a revolutionary natural approach to overcoming arthritic problems induced by aging with Pet Wonder.
[01:31:10.543 --> 01:31:19.565]  Pet Wonder contains glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and shark cartilage, the three top natural ingredients for fighting arthritic problems, particularly inflammation and pain.
[01:31:19.945 --> 01:31:27.372]  Pet Wonder has no side effects, caused a fraction of many pharmaceutical or veterinarian procedures, and results are often seen in just a few days.
[01:31:27.632 --> 01:31:32.937]  Pet Wonder can help change the degeneration of your pet's health and rejuvenate both its health and happiness.
[01:31:33.117 --> 01:31:35.479]  Your pet will thank you for the added energy and spirit.
[01:31:35.659 --> 01:31:40.683]  Call 800-882-3213 for more information or to order Pet Wonder.
[01:31:40.864 --> 01:31:43.466]  It will turn your pet into the puppy or kitten it once was.
[01:31:43.766 --> 01:31:45.408]  Call 800-882-3213 today or visit the web at PetWonder.com.
[01:31:45.548 --> 01:31:46.429]  That's PetWonder.com!
[01:32:16.517 --> 01:32:24.224]  Alright, we're about to go straight to your calls and cover news for the Balance of the Broadcast as we reach the halfway point here.
[01:32:24.244 --> 01:32:30.969]  33 and a half minutes after the hour on this November 3rd, 2004 edition.
[01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:34.052]  Let me just state the facts of the case right now.
[01:32:36.034 --> 01:32:44.501]  While conservatives listening out there are running around giddy with themselves, associating their personal power with George Bush, who they believe is a born-again Christian,
[01:32:45.496 --> 01:32:46.917]  I judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:32:48.238 --> 01:32:50.399]  Implantable microchips being approved.
[01:32:50.739 --> 01:32:53.961]  Federal plans to put transponders in all cars, attacks and traces.
[01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:56.443]  Going forward, the official federal plan.
[01:32:56.943 --> 01:32:58.044]  Totally open borders.
[01:32:58.124 --> 01:32:59.885]  Signing on to UNESCO and the UN.
[01:33:01.126 --> 01:33:06.429]  Quadrupling forced abortion funding while cutting some other abortion funding and lying to you saying they're against it.
[01:33:06.909 --> 01:33:08.610]  Saying they're for assault weapons bans.
[01:33:08.971 --> 01:33:14.194]  Saying they're for the free trade area of the Americas, which is the Pan-American Union, the counterpart of the EU.
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:17.661]  All of this is happening.
[01:33:18.041 --> 01:33:22.986]  Massive growth in government, not just military spending, but Department of Education, transportation.
[01:33:24.727 --> 01:33:30.112]  The Republicans now have the biggest majority since after the Civil War.
[01:33:31.733 --> 01:33:33.995]  Of the House, the Senate, that's the Legislative.
[01:33:34.596 --> 01:33:38.639]  Of the Executive, not just at the federal level, but in the states, the majority of the Governors.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:40.220]  A hearty majority.
[01:33:40.901 --> 01:33:42.923]  And the Judicial, seven of the nine members.
[01:33:44.033 --> 01:33:53.361]  Bush is now going to get to a point at least one new Supreme Court and probably two several slated to retire in the next couple years and it's only going to get worse.
[01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:55.123]  You watch.
[01:33:55.423 --> 01:33:56.464]  You mark my words.
[01:33:57.725 --> 01:34:04.150]  And you're not going to care a lot of you because Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and Michael Weiner and all of them are going to keep you in the dark.
[01:34:04.791 --> 01:34:05.952]  The Ann Coulters of the world.
[01:34:08.134 --> 01:34:10.536]  Because you think they're real conservatives and they're not.
[01:34:12.006 --> 01:34:13.807]  And I am horrified at this prospect.
[01:34:14.107 --> 01:34:21.351]  I'd be horrified if John Kerry was in, but at least I would know the conservatives would start waking up, and we could at least get them to admit we had an enemy.
[01:34:22.652 --> 01:34:24.613]  There's massive evidence of election fraud.
[01:34:24.633 --> 01:34:30.296]  Uh, exit polls showing Kerry winning in a bunch of states, but the electronic voting machines saying the opposite.
[01:34:32.057 --> 01:34:33.118]  Just so much here.
[01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:36.139]  But I challenge you.
[01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:38.861]  Where is the repeal of Roe v. Wade?
[01:34:38.941 --> 01:34:40.442]  Where is the repeal of gun laws?
[01:34:43.337 --> 01:34:45.979]  Where is the control of the border?
[01:34:46.479 --> 01:34:54.303]  Why is Homeland Security being sent out to toy stores in small towns to harass people selling Rubik's Cube knockoffs that aren't even illegal?
[01:34:55.204 --> 01:35:01.327]  Because Homeland Security told her and told the Associated Press, we are over everything, every facet of your life.
[01:35:02.808 --> 01:35:11.233]  So now you watch, they're going to say, we have a mandate, the National ID Card, the Total Information Awareness Network, the Patriot Act 2, for open borders.
[01:35:12.762 --> 01:35:13.482]  For all of it.
[01:35:14.803 --> 01:35:15.703]  Let's go to the calls.
[01:35:16.003 --> 01:35:17.564]  Ron in Oklahoma, thanks for holding.
[01:35:17.824 --> 01:35:18.945]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:35:19.245 --> 01:35:19.485]  Alex.
[01:35:19.825 --> 01:35:20.205]  Yes.
[01:35:20.225 --> 01:35:24.747]  Make it big, repeat it often, and most of the people will believe it.
[01:35:25.067 --> 01:35:27.488]  This is what we've seen in this campaign.
[01:35:27.528 --> 01:35:30.089]  This seems to be the Republican Party motto.
[01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:35.972]  We're headed for another police state, just like our even worst police state, which Oklahoma League is away.
[01:35:37.032 --> 01:35:38.893]  And massive poverty in this country.
[01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:40.034]  The poor are going to get poorer.
[01:35:40.094 --> 01:35:40.754]  Our insurance is
[01:35:41.348 --> 01:35:43.509]  These taxes are going to go up.
[01:35:44.249 --> 01:35:45.369]  Income is going to go down.
[01:35:45.609 --> 01:35:47.270]  The dollar is going down in value.
[01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:48.930]  Oil is exploding in prices.
[01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:54.111]  And they say, we don't care if 90 plus percent of you are against something.
[01:35:54.372 --> 01:35:56.012]  We've got electronic voting machines in.
[01:35:56.252 --> 01:35:57.572]  And go ahead and try to riot.
[01:35:57.872 --> 01:36:01.473]  We've just militarized the police and built internment centers.
[01:36:01.834 --> 01:36:08.015]  Alex, we had a 12 year old kid drug out of school here last Friday for possessing a magic marker in class.
[01:36:08.055 --> 01:36:09.996]  He was doing his homework with a magic marker.
[01:36:10.056 --> 01:36:10.616]  It's illegal.
[01:36:11.553 --> 01:36:14.254]  For a minor, that's a magic marker.
[01:36:14.674 --> 01:36:15.054]  No, I know.
[01:36:15.134 --> 01:36:16.154]  Everything's a crime.
[01:36:16.454 --> 01:36:18.455]  You write the word gun in an essay.
[01:36:18.475 --> 01:36:22.536]  I remember writing essays about cowboys and Indians or whatever in the seventh grade.
[01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:27.757]  Nobody looked at it wrong, but now it's thought crime, forced psychological testing, forced drugging.
[01:36:28.398 --> 01:36:35.740]  I mean, this is hell on earth, and the Republicans are so caught up in George Bush defeated John Kerry, they don't understand.
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:37.440]  These guys were on the same page.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:40.481]  Alex, this kid was arrested, drugged to detention.
[01:36:40.501 --> 01:36:40.981]  His parents
[01:36:41.738 --> 01:36:45.019]  Based on a $750 fine, Oklahoma's a poor state.
[01:36:45.079 --> 01:36:47.659]  We have one of the highest tax flows in the country.
[01:36:47.679 --> 01:36:49.160]  We're number 38th in income.
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.560]  And they're hitting people with things like this.
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:53.000]  It's nonsense.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:56.141]  Valedictorians have graduated.
[01:36:56.161 --> 01:36:57.561]  They're going to graduation.
[01:36:58.282 --> 01:37:00.302]  They're putting on a graduation party.
[01:37:01.442 --> 01:37:03.283]  And they have plastic knives.
[01:37:03.303 --> 01:37:08.964]  You know, the little plastic Dixie sets you buy with the knives, the forks, the spoons.
[01:37:10.396 --> 01:37:11.117]  And they're arrested.
[01:37:11.137 --> 01:37:12.217]  They're federally charged.
[01:37:12.597 --> 01:37:13.478]  A weapon on school.
[01:37:13.538 --> 01:37:15.178]  Plastic, you know, knife.
[01:37:15.699 --> 01:37:17.139]  I mean, this is the new freedom, folks.
[01:37:17.539 --> 01:37:18.880]  Prisons for all of you.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.921]  The economy shifting over into this.
[01:37:21.141 --> 01:37:23.742]  They're quietly training people that homeschoolers are terrorists.
[01:37:24.182 --> 01:37:26.243]  And you're sitting there thinking all this is for Muslims.
[01:37:26.463 --> 01:37:27.504]  Let me tell you, it isn't.
[01:37:28.844 --> 01:37:30.785]  It's not just for Muslims, Alex.
[01:37:31.145 --> 01:37:34.707]  I mean, we have other crazy police state laws here in Oklahoma.
[01:37:35.407 --> 01:37:37.448]  If you have to buy pain medication,
[01:37:38.137 --> 01:37:39.198]  You have to sign for it.
[01:37:39.238 --> 01:37:48.084]  So if you're a caregiver that has health problems and taking care of family members that have health problems, you're automatically on their hit list.
[01:37:48.664 --> 01:37:49.865]  They're going to be all over you.
[01:37:50.205 --> 01:38:01.573]  Ten states, when you buy any type of cold medicine, make you swipe your ID card, which is already the national ID card, now they're just getting around to telling us, under federal specs, that it's getting us ready for this.
[01:38:01.814 --> 01:38:04.676]  Oh, call and start at that.
[01:38:04.696 --> 01:38:05.236]  I know they have.
[01:38:05.649 --> 01:38:09.345]  These government employees want to sit on their backsides and look at their computers.
[01:38:14.295 --> 01:38:18.138]  And put false data under the new National ID card.
[01:38:18.478 --> 01:38:24.021]  Hundreds of private databases with all this information, credit, you name it, are going to be put into there.
[01:38:24.442 --> 01:38:27.444]  And if you've got bad credit, folks, you can't have a job.
[01:38:27.824 --> 01:38:34.368]  They're going to make you go sign up a few hours a week, 10 hours a week, through a federal program working for a private corporation.
[01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:35.329]  You're not even paid.
[01:38:35.569 --> 01:38:38.511]  Then they pay off your debt to allow you to have other jobs.
[01:38:38.571 --> 01:38:39.732]  It's going to be debtor prisons.
[01:38:40.933 --> 01:38:49.157]  We're being terrorized and so many of these people haven't the foggiest idea of what's going on or what's coming.
[01:38:49.878 --> 01:39:05.207]  If the Republican, if Rush Limbaugh had come out and supported Satan for president and Satan had come out against gay marriage, he could have been elected, especially in Oklahoma.
[01:39:06.341 --> 01:39:10.384]  This is how twisted and distorted these people are!
[01:39:10.644 --> 01:39:22.391]  And again, the gay marriage thing is a serious issue for us, but for the globalists it's a red herring distraction, and they're going to have a con-con over that, and they're going to repeal the 22nd Amendment.
[01:39:23.459 --> 01:39:42.150]  Now we're going to get somebody who poses for homosexual porno mags, who says he admires Hitler, wants to be a dictator, and hates the N-word, hates black people, and they're going to cry and worship him and love him, because they have no morals, it's all about labels.
[01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:44.951]  Well who was behind the escape marriage issue anyway?
[01:39:45.011 --> 01:39:45.572]  Karl Rove?
[01:39:45.892 --> 01:39:46.172]  Yes.
[01:39:47.252 --> 01:39:48.033]  Makes sense to me.
[01:39:48.613 --> 01:39:49.814]  Alex, I'll let you go, thank you.
[01:39:50.891 --> 01:39:51.351]  Thank you.
[01:39:51.532 --> 01:39:55.695]  And Bush says that the outsourcing of jobs is our number one export.
[01:39:55.735 --> 01:39:57.036]  He said it was good!
[01:39:57.716 --> 01:40:07.223]  Hamburger jobs, they want to change it to where that's considered an industrial, high quality, lower middle class job.
[01:40:07.743 --> 01:40:08.584]  It isn't, folks.
[01:40:13.267 --> 01:40:14.889]  Again, they control everything now.
[01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:18.131]  Now let's see them slow the growth of government,
[01:40:19.071 --> 01:40:20.312]  Repeal some of this stuff!
[01:40:20.432 --> 01:40:20.712]  Oh no!
[01:40:23.393 --> 01:40:26.754]  First thing on the agenda in the new year, Pan-American Union!
[01:40:28.515 --> 01:40:30.936]  And 98% of people don't even know what that is.
[01:40:30.956 --> 01:40:36.999]  It's like the Europeans didn't know what the European Economic Community was until somebody said, oh by the way, you don't have any rights anymore.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.481]  All this is going on, the Republicans and Democrats voting together,
[01:40:43.894 --> 01:40:46.656]  We got a Republican Governor, Rick Perry, here under the Fed's control.
[01:40:47.376 --> 01:40:49.337]  The nation has 7,000 miles of toll roads.
[01:40:49.357 --> 01:40:51.278]  We're going to have 6,000 in Texas alone.
[01:40:51.519 --> 01:40:53.640]  You're going to have to have a transponder in your car.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:56.722]  And 90 plus percent of people in Texas are against it.
[01:40:56.962 --> 01:40:59.803]  And they just laugh at you and say, go ahead and try to vote us out.
[01:41:00.464 --> 01:41:01.805]  They actually laugh at us.
[01:41:04.386 --> 01:41:05.187]  Because they know.
[01:41:06.047 --> 01:41:07.048]  They go, go ahead and riot.
[01:41:07.748 --> 01:41:10.870]  We got cops in black helmets and black ski masks who will kill you.
[01:41:11.832 --> 01:41:12.433]  You understand?
[01:41:12.653 --> 01:41:15.075]  And they want their paycheck and they'll do whatever they're told.
[01:41:17.056 --> 01:41:18.157]  We're getting rid of your country.
[01:41:18.597 --> 01:41:20.419]  We're going to forcibly, psychologically test you.
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:23.541]  We're going to have national compulsory service.
[01:41:24.442 --> 01:41:25.262]  And I hope you enjoy it.
[01:41:26.363 --> 01:41:31.387]  Well, we're the people and we don't have to go along with this and we're not going to go along with it.
[01:41:32.148 --> 01:41:34.510]  So again, conservatives, you're not real conservatives.
[01:41:34.710 --> 01:41:38.753]  And I predict you're going to sit there and worship big government and lots of freedom
[01:41:39.383 --> 01:41:43.285]  Because there will be little stage fights between the Republicans and Democrats to fool you.
[01:41:44.005 --> 01:41:47.406]  While your eyes are on that fake ball, all the real stuff is going to be happening.
[01:41:48.247 --> 01:41:50.127]  And the Republicans run everything now.
[01:41:50.808 --> 01:41:51.208]  Everything!
[01:41:52.548 --> 01:41:52.988]  Everything!
[01:41:54.009 --> 01:41:57.130]  And the age of big government has just begun.
[01:41:57.990 --> 01:42:00.351]  As Ron Paul said in his Neocon speech last year.
[01:42:00.671 --> 01:42:02.032]  We've got to get him on to talk about this.
[01:42:02.672 --> 01:42:04.473]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred.
[01:42:05.712 --> 01:42:09.454]  No, actually it's John Ohio, then Fred, Alan, and others.
[01:42:10.014 --> 01:42:11.775]  Go ahead, John and Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:42:12.476 --> 01:42:22.961]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about how Kerry has thrown the election to Bush deliberately, and how he's covered up, as Beth Harris said, what he knows about black box rig voting and the war.
[01:42:23.461 --> 01:42:30.585]  But personally, first I just want to say that I was forced to vote for Baden-Erik of the Libertarian Party, even though
[01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:34.781]  I only agree with them on their anti-police state and anti-war positions.
[01:42:34.861 --> 01:42:40.486]  I would have voted for the Workers' Org or some other leftist party, but they were not allowed on the ballot.
[01:42:41.047 --> 01:42:47.092]  But it's incredible to me that Kerry is not going after this.
[01:42:47.232 --> 01:42:53.938]  I was reading, for instance, how he suppressed what he knew full well about Bush's lies in the months and years leading up to the war.
[01:42:54.537 --> 01:43:13.207]  On the mildly liberal CommonDreams.org website, Stephen Zunes had led delegations of people from former CIA, former State Department weapons inspectors in the months leading up to the war that proved that Bush was lying in all of his phony pretext to attack the war, to attack Iraq, out-provoked.
[01:43:13.647 --> 01:43:15.608]  And he completely shut these people out.
[01:43:15.648 --> 01:43:20.191]  He didn't want to hear from anybody who contradicted Bush's lies setting us up for this war.
[01:43:20.811 --> 01:43:22.032]  And to me,
[01:43:22.968 --> 01:43:31.413]  This particular website is actually sort of critical supportive of Kerry, this mildly liberal, and this Stephen Zunes.
[01:43:32.554 --> 01:43:35.756]  He gave him all the documentation and he didn't want to hear any of it.
[01:43:36.657 --> 01:43:45.102]  This leads one's credibility to the fact that this was a staged operation here, because most of the people opposed the war at this point, according to the polls.
[01:43:45.695 --> 01:43:55.420]  And, uh, 67% in a Council on Foreign Relations poll, the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, want the United States to get out, uh, if, uh, if the Iraqi people want us out.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:58.522]  So he could have galvanized tremendous support around this.
[01:43:59.142 --> 01:44:02.644]  And, and this black box voting scandal is ridiculous because
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:15.827]  For instance, the populist in Venezuela was criticized by our media for using some actually very secure, with total paper-trail verification machines.
[01:44:15.867 --> 01:44:19.990]  Yeah, they said, oh, you can't trust those machines, and they even had a record, but oh, here!
[01:44:20.010 --> 01:44:24.252]  Yeah, and in this country, they whitewash it and allow it to completely pass.
[01:44:24.332 --> 01:44:25.213]  I mean, it's an outrage.
[01:44:25.233 --> 01:44:32.517]  You've got a company that's led by billionaire Republicans who contribute to Bush millions of dollars and say they want to
[01:44:32.884 --> 01:44:34.085]  Deliver the vote to Bush.
[01:44:34.465 --> 01:44:36.106]  A totally private operation.
[01:44:36.266 --> 01:44:37.747]  Totally a conflict of interest.
[01:44:37.767 --> 01:44:38.988]  John, let me stop you for a minute.
[01:44:39.408 --> 01:44:40.929]  And you say Bush is wise.
[01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:45.231]  Bush is a puppet just like Kerry.
[01:44:45.632 --> 01:44:47.873]  And the whole left-right paradigm is a fraud.
[01:44:48.653 --> 01:44:52.036]  And you're going to see an explosion in the size of government under Bush.
[01:44:52.476 --> 01:44:54.317]  And you won't have seen the same thing under Kerry.
[01:44:54.958 --> 01:45:02.708]  And so your whole Bleeding Heart, you know, Motorcycle Diary ideas just doesn't hold water, John!
[01:45:02.728 --> 01:45:03.850]  I don't support Gary.
[01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:05.792]  That's the whole point I'm saying here.
[01:45:05.872 --> 01:45:10.118]  I'm saying that he would have probably been
[01:45:13.593 --> 01:45:14.853]  John, it is not my opinion.
[01:45:15.274 --> 01:45:23.356]  The big banks funded and created communism to get people back into feudalism and well-meaning, bleeding hearts like you bought into it.
[01:45:23.837 --> 01:45:25.297]  Now we've socialized the wealth.
[01:45:25.677 --> 01:45:28.138]  It's been fascistically transferred to the big banks.
[01:45:28.618 --> 01:45:30.719]  Look at Russia, look at China, look everywhere else.
[01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:34.521]  Socialism doesn't lead to communism.
[01:45:34.841 --> 01:45:36.241]  It leads to fascism.
[01:45:36.521 --> 01:45:37.622]  That's how it's designed.
[01:45:37.662 --> 01:45:38.282]  Thanks for the call.
[01:45:39.242 --> 01:45:43.745]  And until you guys get the real political science in your brains, it's only going to get worse.
[01:45:44.366 --> 01:45:51.030]  I'm happy to say most socialists are waking up and becoming freedom lovers and are out buying guns and waking up.
[01:45:52.551 --> 01:45:55.834]  But unfortunately, John, you've been calling for years and there's no way to wake you up.
[01:45:56.694 --> 01:45:57.595]  And I'm sad to hear it.
[01:45:58.395 --> 01:46:00.197]  Let's go ahead now, but I do appreciate your call.
[01:46:00.837 --> 01:46:02.398]  Let's talk to Fred in Arkansas.
[01:46:02.438 --> 01:46:03.059]  Fred, go ahead.
[01:46:03.259 --> 01:46:04.139]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:05.500]  I'm not too well.
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:06.441]  I understand that.
[01:46:08.031 --> 01:46:10.332]  I've got one thing I want to say and three questions real quick.
[01:46:11.052 --> 01:46:13.613]  I'd be saying I wasn't doing too well if Kerry won.
[01:46:15.754 --> 01:46:16.814]  No, I don't agree with that.
[01:46:17.714 --> 01:46:20.455]  Number one, I think you're doing... I have all your videos.
[01:46:20.735 --> 01:46:21.115]  Well, thanks.
[01:46:21.175 --> 01:46:22.316]  And we do pass them around.
[01:46:22.896 --> 01:46:25.557]  And we've had a very positive experience with that.
[01:46:25.977 --> 01:46:28.658]  Especially with the 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny.
[01:46:30.018 --> 01:46:34.099]  And we have had people actually watch it twice in one evening.
[01:46:34.639 --> 01:46:35.360]  Well, that's $5.95 now.
[01:46:37.549 --> 01:46:46.833]  When you buy one DVD for $24.95, almost three hours long, each additional copy $5.95, I hope you'll buy a whole bunch of them and give them as gifts, listeners, but go ahead.
[01:46:47.033 --> 01:46:47.793]  That's a good idea.
[01:46:47.913 --> 01:46:48.493]  That's a good idea.
[01:46:48.533 --> 01:46:48.833]  Thank you.
[01:46:49.194 --> 01:46:50.074]  And I love your passion.
[01:46:50.934 --> 01:46:57.977]  I know some days you have really, really... I listened to a tape that you did a couple weeks ago, and you're almost in tears, and I love your passion.
[01:46:58.433 --> 01:46:58.873]  Number one.
[01:46:59.194 --> 01:47:00.975]  Well, I got a family that lives in this country.
[01:47:01.295 --> 01:47:01.955]  I understand that.
[01:47:02.036 --> 01:47:02.856]  I love America.
[01:47:02.916 --> 01:47:03.817]  But I love your passion.
[01:47:03.957 --> 01:47:08.720]  But quite frankly, I'm going to stay here, but the next few years, I may send my family out of this place.
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.041]  I think that's a good idea.
[01:47:10.261 --> 01:47:12.403]  I mean, I may put them in the escape pod.
[01:47:12.843 --> 01:47:13.223]  I agree.
[01:47:13.503 --> 01:47:14.044]  I agree with that.
[01:47:14.084 --> 01:47:16.045]  There's a lot of countries out there that we can go to.
[01:47:16.125 --> 01:47:19.768]  Number one, I was curious about how the Liberation Party did.
[01:47:20.588 --> 01:47:25.411]  Number two, I was curious about your predictions about martial law.
[01:47:26.132 --> 01:47:26.792]  And number three,
[01:47:28.581 --> 01:47:36.785]  You know, I believe, this is not a criticism, don't take this wrong, you are a communicator, and you have communicated to us things.
[01:47:37.446 --> 01:47:39.006]  Now, what is our action?
[01:47:39.707 --> 01:47:50.372]  And according to the things in the Direct Relation of Independence, we have a moral obligation to resist tyranny.
[01:47:51.893 --> 01:47:55.475]  And so I always just thought, other than information, which is your calling,
[01:47:56.417 --> 01:47:59.558]  For us out here, how do we resist that tyranny?
[01:48:02.058 --> 01:48:06.279]  Well, I would pick an issue or two and then start your own organization and fight that.
[01:48:06.339 --> 01:48:08.260]  I would really fight the electronic voting machines.
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:14.061]  That's the star in their crown, the crown jewel, the center of the headpiece.
[01:48:16.362 --> 01:48:17.422]  There's so many issues.
[01:48:17.562 --> 01:48:21.163]  I would mainly wake up the so-called conservatives, who were totally asleep at the switch,
[01:48:21.938 --> 01:48:27.583]  As this country's being shut down right in front of us, and they're busy going, John Kerry, John Kerry's gonna get us!
[01:48:28.164 --> 01:48:29.024]  They did get us.
[01:48:29.225 --> 01:48:31.527]  You know, the exact same policies.
[01:48:31.587 --> 01:48:32.688]  And it really is information.
[01:48:32.708 --> 01:48:36.731]  You know, the Army War College will tell you 90% of this is psychological warfare.
[01:48:37.592 --> 01:48:40.855]  So that's, that's, it's information, information, information.
[01:48:42.496 --> 01:48:46.740]  Well, what do you feel, are you still standing behind what you felt about the martial law?
[01:48:47.821 --> 01:48:48.742]  We're in martial law.
[01:48:49.961 --> 01:48:53.522]  I understand that, but it's not enforced.
[01:48:54.203 --> 01:48:56.003]  Well, it's one increment of martial law.
[01:48:56.884 --> 01:48:58.524]  I mean, they've shut up the mechanisms.
[01:48:58.945 --> 01:49:00.565]  There's this abusive atmosphere.
[01:49:01.445 --> 01:49:03.546]  There's the, we're doing this for your own good, shut up.
[01:49:06.207 --> 01:49:07.508]  They're putting in the control grid.
[01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:11.449]  You don't think it's going to be over at this time?
[01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:13.550]  Well, you were saying my prediction.
[01:49:13.570 --> 01:49:14.730]  What did you think my prediction was?
[01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:18.532]  Well, I thought, I heard the other day, I mean, a couple of weeks ago,
[01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:22.955]  Well, you said that after the election that we were going to enter into martial law.
[01:49:24.156 --> 01:49:29.082]  No, what I said was, is the White House said there would be terror attacks, and I said I never said that.
[01:49:29.462 --> 01:49:31.264]  They're saying it, we have those articles posted.
[01:49:31.765 --> 01:49:35.329]  And then I said, I think you're going to see terror attacks after the election.
[01:49:36.095 --> 01:49:39.678]  And then I think you're going to see all of the police stay in full from that point on.
[01:49:39.718 --> 01:49:40.158]  Absolutely.
[01:49:40.458 --> 01:49:44.921]  And when we come back after the break, I'll hang up now, just tell me how the Liberation Party did.
[01:49:45.261 --> 01:49:45.902]  Libertarians?
[01:49:46.142 --> 01:49:46.842]  Yeah, Libertarians.
[01:49:47.003 --> 01:49:47.583]  Okay, sure.
[01:49:47.683 --> 01:49:48.143]  Good call.
[01:49:48.163 --> 01:49:48.504]  Thank you.
[01:49:48.544 --> 01:49:49.124]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.877 --> 01:50:00.740]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:02.420]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:04.821]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:07.042]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.322 --> 01:50:12.264]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.584 --> 01:50:16.626]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.886 --> 01:50:18.648]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.728 --> 01:50:29.380]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:31.403]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.783 --> 01:50:35.447]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today and man the guns in the Info Wars.

[01:50:53.419 --> 01:50:55.020]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:59.261]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:50:59.401 --> 01:51:02.282]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:02.362 --> 01:51:09.084]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:09.264 --> 01:51:12.265]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:12.485 --> 01:51:14.866]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:14.986 --> 01:51:22.888]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:51:23.148 --> 01:51:51.179]  Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen, Nitrogen
[01:51:54.475 --> 01:51:54.756]  Thank you.
[01:52:09.637 --> 01:52:10.277]  We're good to go!

[01:52:39.156 --> 01:52:42.239]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.419 --> 01:52:48.284]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:02.302 --> 01:53:02.963]  I think so.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:24.423]  They laid their bodies down in a bloody war for liberty.
[01:53:25.743 --> 01:53:34.185]  Thanks to the renegades, we're not free today now because people turn into jellyfish who listen to rhetoric instead of actions.
[01:53:36.095 --> 01:53:37.415]  That's why government's getting so arrogant.
[01:53:37.435 --> 01:53:56.441]  You know, during the break I walked out of my broadcast office and looked at a news article from six, seven months ago that was just sitting there on the table that I had left alone and it was Dick Cheney and Anthony Scalia on a duck hunting trip the week before Scalia was going to hear the case of Cheney's secret documents in the oil fields.
[01:53:57.161 --> 01:53:58.801]  That's a federal crime, folks.
[01:53:59.341 --> 01:54:04.923]  You know, imagine in cases if the defendant is duck hunting the week before with a judge.
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:09.802]  Flying around on the defendant's jet.
[01:54:10.262 --> 01:54:11.183]  It's another example.
[01:54:11.243 --> 01:54:12.704]  It's just criminality everywhere.
[01:54:15.025 --> 01:54:19.227]  We've got a trillion-two missing out of the Pentagon in the last nine years under Bush and Clinton.
[01:54:20.528 --> 01:54:21.829]  No investigation, no nothing.
[01:54:23.269 --> 01:54:26.411]  We've got wholesale corruption, de-industrialization taking place.
[01:54:26.791 --> 01:54:29.493]  They're creating a Pan-American Union right in front of us.
[01:54:31.792 --> 01:54:46.704]  They're openly dismantling the Bill of Rights, openly bringing out a National ID Card, and now the Republicans run everything with super majorities at the state legislations, with the governors, federally, in all three branches, and it's going to get worse.
[01:54:46.744 --> 01:54:47.285]  And you know what?
[01:54:48.385 --> 01:54:50.547]  I'm going to be the evil liberal because I'm against it.
[01:54:50.707 --> 01:54:51.668]  I understand that.
[01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:57.553]  It must feel good to just go to sleep and lie to yourself and not care about your children's futures.
[01:54:58.928 --> 01:55:00.289]  And I'm not talking to our general listeners.
[01:55:00.330 --> 01:55:04.434]  I'm talking to those few out there, you know, that email me, that won't call the show, who call me a liberal.
[01:55:06.956 --> 01:55:08.258]  I'm so sad for this country.
[01:55:11.001 --> 01:55:12.382]  You know, why are you sad, Bush 1?
[01:55:12.462 --> 01:55:14.264]  I'd be sad if Kerry was in there.
[01:55:14.284 --> 01:55:15.946]  I'm sad about this staged election.
[01:55:16.266 --> 01:55:17.928]  That's why I made American dictators.
[01:55:18.539 --> 01:55:20.981]  That's why I documented how the policies are identical.
[01:55:21.282 --> 01:55:26.507]  That's why this film is now more important after the election than it was before the election.
[01:55:26.847 --> 01:55:27.508]  You need to get it.
[01:55:27.528 --> 01:55:28.529]  You need to make copies of it.
[01:55:28.549 --> 01:55:29.429]  You need to educate everybody.
[01:55:29.890 --> 01:55:31.551]  It gets into the electronic voting machines.
[01:55:31.912 --> 01:55:32.833]  Into the police state.
[01:55:32.853 --> 01:55:33.633]  Into 9-11.
[01:55:33.653 --> 01:55:36.837]  Into these guys, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, how they're cousins.
[01:55:38.398 --> 01:55:39.779]  The film's 115 minutes long on DVD.
[01:55:42.486 --> 01:55:43.586]  Each additional copy is only $5.95.
[01:55:44.487 --> 01:55:47.428]  When you buy one for $19.95, go buy five, ten copies.
[01:55:47.468 --> 01:55:48.488]  Give them as gifts to people.
[01:55:50.469 --> 01:55:52.670]  I've got the 9-11 Inside Job Special.
[01:55:52.730 --> 01:55:53.950]  My two 9-11 films.
[01:55:54.351 --> 01:55:55.651]  Eric Huff's 9-11 video.
[01:55:55.671 --> 01:55:56.751]  George Harper's 9-11 video.
[01:55:56.812 --> 01:55:57.572]  Four videos.
[01:55:59.012 --> 01:56:02.434]  What is that?
[01:56:02.814 --> 01:56:02.434]  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[01:56:03.954 --> 01:56:05.555]  Nine and a half hours of video.
[01:56:06.555 --> 01:56:07.135]  Two books.
[01:56:08.476 --> 01:56:09.896]  Over 550 pages.
[01:56:12.319 --> 01:56:14.440]  Actually, with that deal, it's one book, 330 pages.
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.681]  So, four videos in one book, $59.95.
[01:56:19.122 --> 01:56:22.364]  Then, the two books, the book I wrote, the book Paul wrote, were $19.95.
[01:56:22.764 --> 01:56:23.885]  It's a $12 discount.
[01:56:24.465 --> 01:56:27.667]  I don't know if we posted this yet, but I'm just going to give my bumper stickers away for free.
[01:56:27.927 --> 01:56:29.027]  They'll just pay for the shipping.
[01:56:29.848 --> 01:56:32.249]  I just want to get the information out, people.
[01:56:34.378 --> 01:56:38.141]  And it's up to you to get the films and to make copies of the videos I produce and to get them out.
[01:56:38.581 --> 01:56:40.583]  It's unstoppable when you take action.
[01:56:41.763 --> 01:56:43.224]  90% of those that see the films wake up.
[01:56:43.605 --> 01:56:44.926]  So call toll free to get the videos.
[01:56:44.946 --> 01:56:45.006]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:56:45.026 --> 01:56:45.966]  Call right now.
[01:56:46.006 --> 01:56:48.949]  Ask about the different titles, the different specials.
[01:56:48.969 --> 01:56:49.029]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:01.644 --> 01:57:11.690]  By the way, that deal where you buy one copy of American Dictators, that also now goes when you buy one copy of 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny for $24.95, because it's almost three hours.
[01:57:12.190 --> 01:57:13.271]  Each additional is $5.95.
[01:57:13.511 --> 01:57:16.152]  So buy five, ten copies of that.
[01:57:16.493 --> 01:57:17.493]  Two copies of it, whatever.
[01:57:17.513 --> 01:57:26.098]  1-888-253-3139 or go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:57:28.199 --> 01:57:30.961]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, sign up.
[01:57:33.047 --> 01:57:35.850]  And you can watch all the videos, the weekly reports, and the books, and all of it.
[01:57:36.210 --> 01:57:37.251]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:57:37.472 --> 01:57:39.173]  Third hour, your calls, ton of news.
[01:57:39.794 --> 01:57:40.535]  Straight ahead.
[01:57:40.555 --> 01:57:40.975]  Stay with us.
[01:57:40.995 --> 01:57:41.656]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:42.156 --> 01:57:42.617]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.394 --> 01:57:52.435]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.176 --> 01:57:54.257]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.917 --> 01:57:55.778]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.499 --> 01:57:57.419]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:01.763]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.264 --> 01:58:06.367]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:12.593]  Hour number three, post-election coverage.
[01:58:14.071 --> 01:58:25.098]  Lord Kerry has capitulated, now an hour and a half ago, to his cousin, to his sworn honored brother in the Order of Death, the Order of Lucifer, the Black Knights.
[01:58:26.559 --> 01:58:28.981]  He has capitulated in the staged event.
[01:58:29.041 --> 01:58:29.741]  It is complete.
[01:58:31.002 --> 01:58:35.125]  Another victory for the New World Order against the forces of humanity.
[01:58:35.165 --> 01:58:37.306]  It would have been a victory for the New World Order if Kerry won.
[01:58:40.262 --> 01:58:50.947]  And now the Republicans run absolutely everything, the majority of the legislatures, the state governorships, the executive, the judicial, the legislative at the federal level.
[01:58:51.907 --> 01:59:04.493]  And you'll now see an age of forced drugging, forced psychological testing, national ID cards, checkpoints, transponders in cars, national sales taxes, compulsory national service, won't call it a draft, giant government.
[01:59:05.153 --> 01:59:06.034]  This is your new freedom.
[01:59:07.895 --> 01:59:08.395]  And, uh,
[01:59:09.668 --> 01:59:11.869]  And you'll see Arnold Schwarzenegger as your president in 08.
[01:59:12.129 --> 01:59:12.869]  We'll talk about that.
[01:59:13.129 --> 01:59:14.489]  About to go right back to your calls.
[01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:26.433]  The staged election of 04 was simulated mock political combat to get you in the two camps, to get you under the control, to make you think you have a choice so you won't struggle.
[01:59:26.693 --> 01:59:27.733]  The illusion of freedom.
[01:59:27.973 --> 01:59:29.353]  The illusion of an escape route.
[01:59:30.374 --> 01:59:35.975]  The only escape is unlocking your mind and facing this matrix-like wall of wickedness for what it is.
[01:59:38.056 --> 01:59:38.836]  Alright, uh...
[01:59:40.171 --> 01:59:41.992]  Let's go to Allen in Ohio.
[01:59:42.112 --> 01:59:43.233]  Allen, thank you for holding.
[01:59:43.253 --> 01:59:43.693]  Go ahead.
[01:59:43.713 --> 01:59:44.714]  Hello, Alex.
[01:59:45.054 --> 01:59:45.554]  Hello, sir.
[01:59:46.475 --> 01:59:48.816]  I'm listening on the new 9985.
[01:59:48.937 --> 01:59:50.217]  Really, super power.
[01:59:50.818 --> 01:59:52.719]  Alright, great.
[01:59:52.939 --> 01:59:53.780]  A comment.
[01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:58.803]  A gentleman from Ohio that was talking about the Libertarian candidate.
[01:59:58.923 --> 02:00:00.384]  They did print it in the paper.
[02:00:01.264 --> 02:00:03.726]  He got 10,000 and some votes in the state.
[02:00:05.067 --> 02:00:06.648]  Yeah, but then you watch the national news.
[02:00:06.688 --> 02:00:07.648]  It doesn't even show him getting 1%.
[02:00:09.053 --> 02:00:10.534]  How about if in Ohio?
[02:00:10.554 --> 02:00:14.218]  We've got 79 in my county, including mine.
[02:00:16.379 --> 02:00:16.800]  Alright.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.762]  Okay, here's what my question is.
[02:00:18.842 --> 02:00:21.664]  I'm a reader of the Chapman Letter.
[02:00:22.645 --> 02:00:28.050]  He says the U.S., U.K., and Israel are preparing a preemptive Iran strike.
[02:00:28.610 --> 02:00:30.151]  Oh, they said they are, yeah.
[02:00:30.532 --> 02:00:31.252]  Yet this year.
[02:00:33.604 --> 02:00:39.549]  Now my question is, do you think maybe they'll just forget the terrorist attack and go right straight to the wars?
[02:00:41.530 --> 02:00:47.355]  Well, they're calling this a mandate for pre-emptive war, but I don't know, it'll probably come after the new year.
[02:00:47.675 --> 02:00:50.857]  The mullahs, by the way, Iran publicly endorsed Bush.
[02:00:53.099 --> 02:00:53.640]  Did you know that?
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:54.741]  No, I did not.
[02:00:55.001 --> 02:00:57.523]  Yeah, and so did Vladimir Putin, another wonderful person.
[02:00:57.903 --> 02:00:59.024]  You gotta ask yourself why.
[02:01:01.147 --> 02:01:04.169]  Because, frankly, Kerry was more hawkish than Bush.
[02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:07.451]  I don't know.
[02:01:08.972 --> 02:01:21.179]  They may do the terrorist thing, but it sounds like they may just skip it and go right straight to the war and forget all that since we were commenting about it and talking about it.
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:24.761]  There's got to be another convenient terror attack for that to happen.
[02:01:25.542 --> 02:01:26.863]  And to get the draft, too.
[02:01:29.063 --> 02:01:31.324]  That legitimizes the draft, right?
[02:01:31.824 --> 02:01:32.504]  Absolutely.
[02:01:33.465 --> 02:01:37.966]  And Iran is such a tyrannical state that it is very unpopular with most Iranians.
[02:01:38.506 --> 02:01:40.507]  So that's why the globalists think it's ripe for the picking.
[02:01:41.127 --> 02:01:44.468]  But if they miscalculate, we could lose hundreds of thousands of troops in Iran.
[02:01:44.848 --> 02:01:46.569]  Iran is much stronger than Iraq.
[02:01:46.589 --> 02:01:52.831]  Well anyway, the folks out there need to know it's coming, regardless of
[02:01:54.758 --> 02:01:56.659]  What the, uh, comments about it are.
[02:01:56.919 --> 02:02:00.760]  Well, the Republicans run everything now, so let's just see what they do.
[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:06.262]  Okay, that's what I got, so... Well, they've got control of everything.
[02:02:06.282 --> 02:02:10.783]  They had control before, but now it's a huge margin, and, uh, let's see what they do.
[02:02:10.823 --> 02:02:16.145]  Let's put pressure on them to start repealing big government, to control the border, to repeal gun laws.
[02:02:17.205 --> 02:02:18.525]  But I wouldn't hold your breath.
[02:02:20.226 --> 02:02:20.366]  No.
[02:02:21.849 --> 02:02:23.670]  Nope, and I see it the same way you do.
[02:02:24.131 --> 02:02:25.312]  What are you, some kind of liberal?
[02:02:25.332 --> 02:02:26.232]  You're against gun control?
[02:02:28.034 --> 02:02:28.474]  No way.
[02:02:29.975 --> 02:02:31.156]  Hey, thanks for the call, Alan.
[02:02:32.177 --> 02:02:38.361]  Alright, Fred and Tim and Steve and everybody else, your calls are up next when we get back.
[02:02:38.842 --> 02:02:42.665]  Your chance to chime in about the 04 staged election.
[02:02:42.785 --> 02:02:43.185]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.643 --> 02:02:49.965]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.165 --> 02:02:54.567]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.727 --> 02:02:59.109]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[02:02:59.209 --> 02:03:00.510]  A New World Order.
[02:03:01.290 --> 02:03:02.231]  Panama.
[02:03:02.291 --> 02:03:06.512]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.572 --> 02:03:13.495]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.

[02:04:45.023 --> 02:04:45.724]  Hi, I'm Ron.
[02:04:45.844 --> 02:04:48.205]  I'm taking collagen aids from Finland Vigor.
[02:04:48.486 --> 02:04:51.768]  And I have taken 20 pounds off and 6 inches off my waist.
[02:04:52.008 --> 02:04:52.368]  It works.
[02:04:52.528 --> 02:04:55.210]  I've gone down 35 pounds!
[02:04:55.470 --> 02:05:01.214]  And I've got energy and vitality that I never dreamed that I would ever have again.
[02:05:01.295 --> 02:05:05.097]  I'm going to be 51 years old and I feel as good as I did when I was 35.
[02:05:05.978 --> 02:05:07.079]  And I look that good too.
[02:05:07.619 --> 02:05:08.379]  That's great!

[02:05:35.638 --> 02:05:36.078]  Call today!
[02:05:36.238 --> 02:05:36.738]  Big Brother.
[02:05:36.819 --> 02:05:37.419]  Mainstream Media.
[02:05:53.215 --> 02:05:54.296]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.976 --> 02:05:55.817]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.537 --> 02:05:57.418]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.438 --> 02:06:01.961]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.301 --> 02:06:06.424]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.784 --> 02:06:08.765]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[02:06:10.906 --> 02:06:17.971]  Until about 40 after, I am going to take one call after another as fast as you fill up the lines that open up.
[02:06:21.113 --> 02:06:26.316]  No matter how good your question or statement is, I'm keeping you down to about a minute and I'll have 30 seconds of comment.
[02:06:26.696 --> 02:06:27.776]  I want to give everybody a chance.
[02:06:27.796 --> 02:06:30.878]  As soon as you hear somebody hang up, dial in.
[02:06:32.159 --> 02:06:34.780]  Again, two hours ago, roughly two hours ago,
[02:06:36.923 --> 02:06:51.794]  John Kerry capitulated to George Bush, rolling over to him, despite the fact that it showed that exit polls in many states showed Kerry was winning, but those magic electronic voting machines, especially in Ohio, where the owner of Diebold said, I am committed, I will deliver you the electoral votes.
[02:06:52.835 --> 02:06:53.195]  Ha ha!
[02:06:53.455 --> 02:06:54.296]  When he owns the machines.
[02:06:54.616 --> 02:06:56.097]  And again, I'm not for Kerry either.
[02:06:56.377 --> 02:06:58.179]  The point is, this shows how staged it is.
[02:07:01.522 --> 02:07:10.327]  And then I want to get into how Bush controls everything now, at federal and state level, and how we should pressure them to really be conservatives, but don't hold your breath.
[02:07:10.647 --> 02:07:16.150]  So that's coming up, plus a lot of electronic voting machine fraud news, some police state news, some foreign international news.
[02:07:16.391 --> 02:07:19.392]  But we're all distracted by this, we better keep our eye on some of the other issues.
[02:07:19.753 --> 02:07:21.654]  So get ready callers, we're going to you.
[02:07:21.954 --> 02:07:23.635]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:07:29.684 --> 02:07:30.004]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:07:30.144 --> 02:07:34.307]  Here we go.
[02:07:35.408 --> 02:07:39.591]  Let's go ahead and who's up next here in order?
[02:07:40.571 --> 02:07:42.753]  Fred in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:07:43.373 --> 02:07:55.061]  I wanted to, could you lay out some examples, Alex, of the number one, the inadvertent posting of results before an election, and number two, the
[02:07:56.519 --> 02:08:11.172]  The absurd upset of a candidate like Buchanan by Dole, that type of an example, where you have manipulation and tampering of a total.
[02:08:12.133 --> 02:08:17.218]  Could you kind of throw some examples down that you know of?
[02:08:17.318 --> 02:08:22.843]  I know of a half a dozen that I've heard for the first one and several for the second type.
[02:08:23.706 --> 02:08:29.354]  Well, clearly, Buchanan, they admit, in hindsight, won a bunch of states that they claim they got like 5% of the vote.
[02:08:29.714 --> 02:08:34.240]  And after they counted, he actually won in 96 against Dole in the primaries.
[02:08:34.921 --> 02:08:37.865]  I was working at the election center just to watch things in 96.
[02:08:38.946 --> 02:08:48.012]  And about 60% of the ballots I looked at, I was just stacking them up to stick them in the machine, but I could see them on the Scantron were for Buchanan.
[02:08:48.593 --> 02:08:58.019]  I was talking to all the other tables getting the ballots in the right order to stick them in the machine, but then it showed he got like 5% in Austin when the guy had almost all the votes.
[02:08:59.299 --> 02:09:05.101]  We had in 98 ABC News, days before, posted the exact results of the election that indeed happened.
[02:09:05.121 --> 02:09:06.362]  I wouldn't say why they did it.
[02:09:07.182 --> 02:09:14.145]  A few weeks ago, in Green Bay, they posted the results of Bush winning, as he did, on their TV website from the AP.
[02:09:14.885 --> 02:09:18.906]  Two days ago, Rocky Mountain News did it, posted the results.
[02:09:19.046 --> 02:09:20.367]  I mean, it's bizarre.
[02:09:20.407 --> 02:09:21.387]  It is bizarre.
[02:09:21.827 --> 02:09:26.509]  It is bizarre, and I do think that if I don't have the time to
[02:09:27.099 --> 02:09:29.740]  To gather these examples, but they're hard examples.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:32.660]  These are not rumors.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:34.641]  Yes, we're living in total fraud, okay?
[02:09:34.761 --> 02:09:35.781]  Thanks for the call, Fred.
[02:09:36.101 --> 02:09:36.681]  It's admitted.
[02:09:36.761 --> 02:09:37.402]  It's a fraud.
[02:09:37.622 --> 02:09:40.782]  Convicted hackers and felons are vice presidents of these companies.
[02:09:41.042 --> 02:09:41.823]  It's total fraud.
[02:09:41.843 --> 02:09:44.823]  They've been caught stealing elections the last five years with these things.
[02:09:45.283 --> 02:09:46.264]  It's a total fraud, okay?
[02:09:46.284 --> 02:09:47.264]  And they say, just trust us.
[02:09:47.944 --> 02:09:49.124]  Steven Mass.
[02:09:50.125 --> 02:09:51.505]  Actually, Tim in Connecticut's up next.
[02:09:51.525 --> 02:09:52.385]  This is Steven Mass.
[02:09:52.425 --> 02:09:53.405]  Tim in Connecticut.
[02:09:53.445 --> 02:09:53.786]  Go ahead.
[02:09:54.286 --> 02:09:54.866]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:09:55.046 --> 02:09:55.266]  Good.
[02:09:55.683 --> 02:09:57.263]  God bless you, sir, and God bless what you're doing.
[02:09:58.104 --> 02:10:01.624]  I just recently had a heart attack, and I just felt compelled to call you.
[02:10:02.485 --> 02:10:14.508]  I get a little sick and tired because, you know, I care for you so much, what you're doing, and I get a little sick and tired when you get so agitated, especially when you say that, you know, they're laughing at us, and they're laughing at us.
[02:10:15.128 --> 02:10:20.709]  I've called you once before, and I told you about a document called the Hidden Tyranny.
[02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:24.490]  It's also called, also known as the Rosenthal Document.
[02:10:25.785 --> 02:10:31.168]  And on page 23, it tells you why they are laughing at us.
[02:10:31.688 --> 02:10:34.389]  They're laughing at all forms of passive resistance.
[02:10:35.190 --> 02:10:38.211]  TV, radio, falling short of physical expulsion.
[02:10:38.632 --> 02:10:46.856]  Europe had this problem and Europe decided that they had to physically expel them out of their country because all forms of passive resistance just don't work against these brothers.
[02:10:47.739 --> 02:10:53.782]  And I just wanted to get the word out, because I know you're out there doing everything you can, and God bless you, but I just wanted to get the word out.
[02:10:53.822 --> 02:10:56.343]  Listen, you know, Tim, here's the difference.
[02:10:57.243 --> 02:11:00.264]  I haven't read this document, but... You should, Alex, really.
[02:11:00.344 --> 02:11:03.385]  But, I mean, obviously, you think it's a Jewish conspiracy?
[02:11:04.126 --> 02:11:09.408]  No, I heard Tex Marz on October 31st, I was listening to him at 10pm that night, and he was like this...
[02:11:10.089 --> 02:11:22.516]  Rackin' on Bush and the White House standoff, Ariel Sharon is like... Obviously there are Zionists high level in the New World Order, but at the very top it's a Germanic death cult.
[02:11:22.636 --> 02:11:30.901]  I've really studied this, and they just manipulate different groups, and it's levels within levels.
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:38.062]  Of this thing, and I think it's counterproductive to say it's any one group running things, because then that plays into the globalist's hands.
[02:11:38.082 --> 02:11:39.082]  But I'll check out what you're saying.
[02:11:39.102 --> 02:11:39.643]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:40.043 --> 02:11:41.203]  Let's go to Steve in Mass.
[02:11:41.243 --> 02:11:42.083]  Steve, you're on the air.
[02:11:42.143 --> 02:11:42.563]  Go ahead.
[02:11:43.684 --> 02:11:43.964]  Hello.
[02:11:44.424 --> 02:11:44.744]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:45.244 --> 02:11:45.484]  Hi.
[02:11:45.724 --> 02:11:46.125]  Hi, Alex.
[02:11:46.145 --> 02:11:46.505]  How are you?
[02:11:46.645 --> 02:11:46.925]  Good.
[02:11:47.825 --> 02:11:49.926]  I wish I could say the same.
[02:11:51.006 --> 02:11:53.127]  Well, I'm still alive, and there's still a lot of freedom.
[02:11:54.887 --> 02:11:56.608]  But, you know, either way, they win.
[02:11:57.809 --> 02:11:58.370]  Not for long.
[02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:59.250]  Not for long.
[02:11:59.310 --> 02:12:02.112]  Now that Bush is back in there, he's got more control than he had before.
[02:12:03.413 --> 02:12:23.967]  I listened to you a few minutes ago when you were talking to Debelle Harris from blackbox.org voting, the blackbox.org, and I was on her website reading some of the things that she's requesting through the Freedom of Information Act when John Kerry conceded
[02:12:24.682 --> 02:12:24.983]  I don't
[02:12:40.444 --> 02:12:41.704]  Before this election in 2004.
[02:12:41.965 --> 02:12:47.307]  You know, my honest opinion is that Terry's part of all this whole thing.
[02:12:47.687 --> 02:12:48.587]  He's part of the scam.
[02:12:49.027 --> 02:12:49.988]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:12:50.028 --> 02:12:57.911]  I mean, we clearly have him winning in exit polls in key states by wide margins, and then the Diebold machines show the opposite.
[02:12:58.791 --> 02:13:00.532]  And they've been caught doing this over and over again.
[02:13:00.612 --> 02:13:01.552]  Does he challenge it?
[02:13:01.952 --> 02:13:02.232]  No, he doesn't.
[02:13:02.252 --> 02:13:02.952]  No, he didn't challenge it.
[02:13:02.972 --> 02:13:04.593]  That's what amazed me.
[02:13:05.353 --> 02:13:08.434]  He did challenge Ohio, but he didn't challenge Minnesota.
[02:13:08.454 --> 02:13:09.715]  He didn't challenge Pennsylvania.
[02:13:10.035 --> 02:13:11.456]  He did not challenge Florida.
[02:13:11.996 --> 02:13:21.723]  Now, yesterday, I was watching part of the election on Channel 7, NBC News from Boston, the affiliate station.
[02:13:21.743 --> 02:13:25.105]  They were at the Democracy Plaza with Tom Brokaw and Tim Russert.
[02:13:26.026 --> 02:13:33.291]  It was the lady that came on, and she said that she touched, on the touchscreen voting machine, she touched John Kerry.
[02:13:33.671 --> 02:13:34.812]  The vote went to George Bush.
[02:13:35.453 --> 02:13:37.414]  Look, we have that in the local Austin paper.
[02:13:38.257 --> 02:13:39.418]  Well, you have that in the paper already.
[02:13:53.553 --> 02:13:57.354]  Look, I have a giant stack of election fraud.
[02:13:58.775 --> 02:14:05.357]  It wouldn't matter who won, because they're both for the same thing, but it just shows that it's completely staged.
[02:14:05.837 --> 02:14:10.759]  Well, what I was going to say, even if Kerry had won the election,
[02:14:11.539 --> 02:14:14.121]  It wouldn't matter, because the Republicans are still in control.
[02:14:14.161 --> 02:14:23.986]  They still control the House, they still control the judiciary, they still control... But Kerry's for Naftogen getting free trade area of the Americas, and for total amnesty, and for assault weapons bans, and for signing on to UNESCO.
[02:14:24.206 --> 02:14:28.389]  He's for everything Bush is for, thanks for the call.
[02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:30.530]  Again, I'd be just as depressed if it was Kerry.
[02:14:31.070 --> 02:14:39.135]  The only good thing if it would have been Kerry is conservatives would stop thinking big government, and force psychological testing, and AmeriCorps is conservative!
[02:14:41.215 --> 02:14:42.136]  Chris in Kentucky.
[02:14:42.196 --> 02:14:42.957]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:14:43.057 --> 02:14:43.378]  Go ahead.
[02:14:43.398 --> 02:14:43.558]  Welcome.
[02:14:44.018 --> 02:14:47.923]  Hey Alex, I tell you, this is the one of the most... Welcome to the Communist States of America.
[02:14:47.963 --> 02:14:48.584]  More power.
[02:14:48.604 --> 02:14:51.767]  And I want to tell the listeners out there, I was a Republican.
[02:14:52.108 --> 02:14:52.408]  Okay?
[02:14:52.608 --> 02:14:53.830]  I was a Republican.
[02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:56.453]  And now I see there is no left or right anything anymore.
[02:14:58.422 --> 02:15:04.284]  There's nothing but organized criminals sucking us dry and sending a police state to start butchering us.
[02:15:04.704 --> 02:15:05.764]  That's exactly right.
[02:15:06.224 --> 02:15:14.126]  This staging with Mrs. Carey about name-calling to the First Lady Bush's wife, that's staged.
[02:15:14.786 --> 02:15:15.966]  I heard this at work all day.
[02:15:16.647 --> 02:15:17.527]  No, no, no.
[02:15:17.867 --> 02:15:19.407]  WWF wrestling's real.
[02:15:20.007 --> 02:15:21.008]  Yeah, that's real.
[02:15:23.234 --> 02:15:25.155]  Also, we have problems with our voter machines here.
[02:15:27.395 --> 02:15:28.156]  It's ridiculous.
[02:15:28.356 --> 02:15:33.698]  Everywhere had the machines shutting down, having problems, kicking out 10,000, 50,000 votes there.
[02:15:34.858 --> 02:15:41.200]  Just giant lines of people, I'm voting for Kerry, I'm voting for Kerry, and then you count it up and Bush wins in those very precincts.
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:42.421]  It's a joke!
[02:15:42.961 --> 02:15:45.082]  And now they're talking, we need some touch tones.
[02:15:45.202 --> 02:15:47.302]  Wouldn't that be a good idea for Kentucky?
[02:15:47.342 --> 02:15:49.163]  It's all over the media, they're pushing for it.
[02:15:49.503 --> 02:15:51.844]  And again, it's already digital in your state in most of the areas.
[02:15:51.884 --> 02:15:54.844]  They just put it on the Scantron, which is then run into a computer.
[02:15:55.244 --> 02:15:55.404]  Yep.
[02:15:55.725 --> 02:15:56.805]  And it's all the fraud.
[02:15:57.405 --> 02:16:00.766]  And I'm still making copies of your American Dictators, and I'm going to keep going with this.
[02:16:00.786 --> 02:16:01.526]  It's time to wake people up.
[02:16:01.546 --> 02:16:02.546]  I'm more pumped up than ever before.
[02:16:02.646 --> 02:16:03.446]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:16:03.707 --> 02:16:17.650]  When they're making you take a transponder in your car in the next couple of years and drive it, and everything's a toll road, when they're forcibly, psychologically testing your child by law, when the border is completely wide open with a blanket amnesty, when we're signed on to UN taxes and Bush is in office,
[02:16:18.402 --> 02:16:22.584]  Just ask your conservative friends, and they'll go, well, at least it isn't Kerry.
[02:16:22.604 --> 02:16:23.965]  Yes, exactly.
[02:16:23.985 --> 02:16:25.046]  This is a joke!
[02:16:25.546 --> 02:16:27.367]  How brainwashed everybody is out here.
[02:16:28.267 --> 02:16:34.911]  I've been trying to tell people at work today, and they just get like, just like that Bohemian Grove image, and I'm like, no, Bush is good.
[02:16:34.931 --> 02:16:38.013]  They snarl, you know, and I'm still working on it.
[02:16:38.033 --> 02:16:39.053]  I'm not going to stop, Alex.
[02:16:39.354 --> 02:16:42.295]  We're conservatives around here!
[02:16:42.575 --> 02:16:45.717]  We like the new national ID card about to pass.
[02:16:46.177 --> 02:16:47.258]  We like all the
[02:16:48.294 --> 02:16:54.018]  We like to worship Moloch and do devil worship, and it's not okay for us, but that's the Christian conservative way.
[02:16:54.738 --> 02:17:01.563]  If your neighbor was worshipping Moloch or in skull and bones, they've released video of them openly worshipping Satan, and they admit it's real.
[02:17:01.983 --> 02:17:04.625]  Then they make jokes about it and go, well, it's just fun.
[02:17:04.645 --> 02:17:05.905]  It's fun, yeah.
[02:17:06.046 --> 02:17:06.686]  That's all they're saying.
[02:17:06.726 --> 02:17:07.506]  Both sides say that.
[02:17:07.566 --> 02:17:08.407]  It's just for fun.
[02:17:08.467 --> 02:17:10.248]  You see, it's all out in the open now.
[02:17:11.029 --> 02:17:12.029]  It's all out in the open.
[02:17:12.250 --> 02:17:14.451]  Everything they're doing, just flaunting it.
[02:17:15.276 --> 02:17:17.918]  And they're saying, hey, we're putting in the machines, the voting machines.
[02:17:18.259 --> 02:17:19.139]  There's nothing you can do.
[02:17:19.159 --> 02:17:21.781]  We're militarizing the police.
[02:17:21.801 --> 02:17:23.223]  We're building lots of camps for you.
[02:17:23.243 --> 02:17:24.604]  We'll make everything a crime.
[02:17:25.084 --> 02:17:26.786]  Shut up, slaves.
[02:17:26.826 --> 02:17:27.306]  Shut up.
[02:17:27.686 --> 02:17:29.588]  Bring it to your house and take anything we want.
[02:17:30.368 --> 02:17:30.989]  With no warrant.
[02:17:31.169 --> 02:17:31.589]  That's right.
[02:17:31.630 --> 02:17:33.931]  You learned how to be slaves.
[02:17:34.112 --> 02:17:35.493]  It's for your own good.
[02:17:35.873 --> 02:17:36.253]  Shut up.
[02:17:36.694 --> 02:17:37.594]  Yeah, that's a good deal.
[02:17:37.755 --> 02:17:40.157]  Yeah, well, the good news is the awakening is accelerating.
[02:17:40.177 --> 02:17:41.197]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:17:42.138 --> 02:17:44.180]  We'll be right back, folks, with more of your calls, more news.
[02:17:45.951 --> 02:17:49.233]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:17:49.273 --> 02:17:53.456]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:17:53.717 --> 02:17:56.499]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:17:56.699 --> 02:17:59.100]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:17:59.281 --> 02:18:07.907]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:18:08.127 --> 02:18:09.468]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:18:09.668 --> 02:18:13.831]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:18:14.151 --> 02:18:14.451]  I think so.
[02:18:44.071 --> 02:18:44.332]  Yes, I am.
[02:19:06.955 --> 02:19:13.684]  Right now, Minus Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[02:19:18.210 --> 02:19:26.000]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.

[02:19:40.957 --> 02:19:44.081]  Get your Red Book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[02:19:45.310 --> 02:19:47.792]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[02:19:48.192 --> 02:19:51.115]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[02:19:51.255 --> 02:19:54.918]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[02:19:55.098 --> 02:19:57.540]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[02:19:57.700 --> 02:20:00.943]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[02:20:01.143 --> 02:20:08.489]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[02:20:08.709 --> 02:20:10.390]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.
[02:20:10.470 --> 02:20:14.292]  You can also get AM and FM, listen to cassette, and control your CD changer.
[02:20:14.392 --> 02:20:16.513]  Call Freeway Radio today, toll-free, 866-404-3600.
[02:20:16.553 --> 02:20:17.193]  That's 1-866-404-3600.
[02:20:17.293 --> 02:20:19.674]  Get your own Sony shortwave car stereo today for only $189.
[02:20:19.814 --> 02:20:21.435]  Install it in the boat, the RV, or your car.
[02:20:28.058 --> 02:20:32.499]  The good news for us is that you'll have GCN programming and crystal clear radio wherever you go.
[02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:37.721]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[02:20:37.801 --> 02:20:40.302]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[02:20:44.665 --> 02:20:48.368]  You've heard about PAWS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[02:20:48.649 --> 02:20:52.932]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[02:20:53.173 --> 02:21:00.119]  Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[02:21:00.499 --> 02:21:07.148]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[02:21:07.468 --> 02:21:10.933]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[02:21:11.073 --> 02:21:12.074]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit bio-ox.com.
[02:21:16.039 --> 02:21:23.182]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason Bio-Ox International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[02:21:23.262 --> 02:21:29.945]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[02:21:30.165 --> 02:21:34.848]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[02:21:35.028 --> 02:21:37.569]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[02:21:37.709 --> 02:21:42.371]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use Bio-Ox family of products.
[02:21:48.698 --> 02:21:51.200]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:56.744]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.985 --> 02:21:59.567]  Oh my gee!
[02:21:59.767 --> 02:22:01.808]  This is Donnis Haspard here.
[02:22:03.049 --> 02:22:06.312]  I wish we could repeal some of this stuff, but we can't.
[02:22:06.972 --> 02:22:10.435]  Our margin's too small in the House and Senate.
[02:22:11.556 --> 02:22:15.159]  They got giant gains in the House, giant gains in the Senate.
[02:22:16.551 --> 02:22:20.333]  A lame duck president who can do whatever he wants isn't facing re-election.
[02:22:21.393 --> 02:22:22.553]  What is it?
[02:22:22.573 --> 02:22:23.994]  34 governorships?
[02:22:24.374 --> 02:22:25.475]  Most legislatures?
[02:22:26.775 --> 02:22:27.736]  The Supreme Court?
[02:22:29.176 --> 02:22:29.616]  Everything!
[02:22:30.777 --> 02:22:36.039]  The federal agencies reorganizing their homeland security, the bureaucracies under their... They could get rid of all of it!
[02:22:36.359 --> 02:22:38.740]  But don't hold your breath, because you'll suffocate!
[02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:41.501]  You're going to see the age of big government.
[02:22:42.023 --> 02:22:43.785]  The age of corporate welfare.
[02:22:44.065 --> 02:22:45.886]  The age of compulsory service.
[02:22:46.207 --> 02:22:49.189]  The age of the New World Order.
[02:22:51.111 --> 02:22:53.253]  Democrats are going to gallop along happily with it.
[02:22:53.373 --> 02:22:54.414]  It is staged.
[02:22:55.375 --> 02:22:58.397]  You don't think when you get into trillion-dollar scams that it isn't staged?
[02:22:58.858 --> 02:23:00.699]  There's a lot of money and power involved here.
[02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:03.762]  Rob in Tennessee, then Eric, Vanessa, Ed, Vince, and others.
[02:23:04.082 --> 02:23:04.843]  Rob, you're on the air.
[02:23:04.883 --> 02:23:05.283]  Go ahead.
[02:23:06.504 --> 02:23:07.085]  Hey, Alex.
[02:23:07.665 --> 02:23:07.966]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:08.326 --> 02:23:08.846]  Hey, Alex.
[02:23:08.866 --> 02:23:09.507]  Good to talk to you.
[02:23:10.743 --> 02:23:16.005]  Okay, here's my take on the election and the numbers and all that.
[02:23:16.806 --> 02:23:27.370]  Okay, even if the numbers are correct, and I'm not saying they are, but even if they were correct, you'd have to believe that the majority won.
[02:23:27.831 --> 02:23:33.693]  If you add the Democrat and the Independent vote, it comes up way over what the Republicans got.
[02:23:34.754 --> 02:23:35.654]  Would you say that's true?
[02:23:36.548 --> 02:23:45.430]  Almost clearly, if you add the Constitution Party, Libertarian Party, Green Party, in with the Democrats, that Bush did not get a majority of the votes.
[02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:52.312]  But we have a constitutional system where the states are independent, I believe, in the Electoral College.
[02:23:53.192 --> 02:23:53.412]  Right.
[02:23:54.192 --> 02:23:54.432]  Right.
[02:23:54.552 --> 02:23:58.693]  Well, you know, and I mean, this should be an outcry to the President.
[02:23:58.733 --> 02:23:59.934]  I mean, I voted Libertarian.
[02:24:00.034 --> 02:24:00.994]  I voted my conscience.
[02:24:01.614 --> 02:24:05.775]  And, you know, I don't believe that President Bush
[02:24:06.383 --> 02:24:08.904]  Well, remember, George Bush isn't running anything.
[02:24:08.924 --> 02:24:09.125]  Right.
[02:24:33.420 --> 02:24:34.962]  But yes, it's what the elite wants.
[02:24:34.982 --> 02:24:35.603]  Thanks for the call.
[02:24:35.623 --> 02:24:36.464]  Good to hear from you, Rob.
[02:24:36.904 --> 02:24:37.825]  Eric and Mash.
[02:24:37.945 --> 02:24:38.606]  Go ahead, Eric.
[02:24:39.407 --> 02:24:40.268]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:24:40.288 --> 02:24:40.368]  Good.
[02:24:41.635 --> 02:24:52.185]  I just wanted to make a comment on an article I was reading on Save the Males last week, where he was trying to say Kerry is in league with the European branch of the Illuminati, and Bush represents it.
[02:24:52.205 --> 02:24:53.406]  Yeah, I know.
[02:24:53.426 --> 02:24:57.129]  Henry's indeed a good guy, but I totally disagree with that.
[02:24:57.329 --> 02:25:03.435]  Obviously, the Bin Laden tape would help Bush, and I don't know how anybody could come up with the idea that it would help Kerry.
[02:25:04.853 --> 02:25:12.438]  Well, he was saying that Bush winning the election would go against what the European branches wishes were and that it would throw a monkey wrench.
[02:25:12.458 --> 02:25:16.821]  Well, I'll say there's an indicator there that the Bilderberg Group did endorse Kerry and that does show a fissure.
[02:25:20.383 --> 02:25:20.663]  Right.
[02:25:22.464 --> 02:25:24.726]  But Europe owns this country, brother.
[02:25:26.367 --> 02:25:30.670]  England, Germany, the Dutch own this country.
[02:25:31.090 --> 02:25:33.972]  I can look at the actual numbers of holding companies and who owns what
[02:25:34.817 --> 02:25:37.479]  Uh, that's why people call them, go, oh, it's the Jews, it's the Jews.
[02:25:37.539 --> 02:25:40.521]  Well, yeah, I mean, I guess the Rothschilds are Jewish.
[02:25:40.601 --> 02:25:41.562]  Blond hair, blue eyes.
[02:25:41.622 --> 02:25:42.423]  Yeah.
[02:25:42.523 --> 02:25:47.966]  I mean, really, they're so German and Austrian, you can't even, I mean, maybe there's some Jewish blood back there.
[02:25:47.986 --> 02:25:48.707]  I mean, what does it matter?
[02:25:48.947 --> 02:25:54.391]  But most of it is owned by Dutch and British and German royalty, which is Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
[02:25:54.871 --> 02:25:55.852]  It's the same family.
[02:25:56.804 --> 02:26:02.346]  And they trace their bloodlines back to Vlad the Impaler, that's MSNBC, and that's who really owns things.
[02:26:02.466 --> 02:26:16.870]  And so Europe uses us as the bad cop through this whole thing, and then going back to the Dark Ages, whenever the population gets mad at the King's tyranny, they hang the Jews out to dry, and use willing Jewish accomplices to sell out their own people.
[02:26:17.210 --> 02:26:20.471]  Zionists, this is mainstream, actually were in league with Hitler.
[02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:24.122]  I mean, that's true!
[02:26:24.182 --> 02:26:30.909]  My grandmother was Austrian and she fled from Austria when Hitler was coming to rise and fled to America with my mother.
[02:26:30.929 --> 02:26:33.392]  I'm actually first generation American on my mother's side.
[02:26:35.013 --> 02:26:37.976]  So I have kind of a knowledge of the Hitler.
[02:26:39.256 --> 02:26:40.336]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:27:08.388 --> 02:27:09.769]  And it's a very hot thing to do.
[02:27:10.249 --> 02:27:20.675]  Well, we're being de-industrialized, and the control grid's being put in place, and as things get worse, I just hope three years down the road, conservatives go, man, Bush ran everything, and the things got worse.
[02:27:20.735 --> 02:27:21.335]  Well, why?
[02:27:21.796 --> 02:27:30.801]  They've got this super-majority now, and they're gonna give you a con-con and get Arnold ready to be our new lord and master, because he loves Hitler.
[02:27:30.921 --> 02:27:31.441]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.033 --> 02:27:39.037]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.958 --> 02:27:42.641]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.811 --> 02:27:48.853]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[02:27:49.234 --> 02:27:51.715]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:27:51.956 --> 02:27:59.041]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:27:59.221 --> 02:28:02.523]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:28:02.763 --> 02:28:04.805]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:28:05.145 --> 02:28:12.951]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:28:13.211 --> 02:28:14.492]  Either way, why chance it?
[02:28:14.612 --> 02:28:24.539]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[02:28:44.472 --> 02:28:50.655]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:50.795 --> 02:28:58.879]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:28:59.139 --> 02:29:06.183]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:06.323 --> 02:29:07.284]  We're good to go!

[02:30:47.116 --> 02:30:52.278]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.919 --> 02:30:55.240]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:31:06.964 --> 02:31:08.504]  Alright folks, we're back live.
[02:31:08.544 --> 02:31:11.545]  I'm just going to take five more calls because I've got a bunch of news I want to cover.
[02:31:12.725 --> 02:31:14.886]  Vanessa, Vince, Dave, Storm, Ed.
[02:31:15.406 --> 02:31:18.927]  Sorry to others, we're not going to have time to get to you, but we'll get to those five that I just mentioned.
[02:31:19.708 --> 02:31:24.729]  We'll recap some of the top stories and talk to Paul Watson with some of his unique insight here in just a moment.
[02:31:25.369 --> 02:31:32.552]  Before we do that, I hope you'll take advantage of the specials I'm offering on my videos and the books I've published.
[02:31:32.572 --> 02:31:34.172]  The book I wrote, the other book I published.
[02:31:34.818 --> 02:31:54.763]  We have the exposed 9-11 as an inside job special with my two-and-a-half hour, almost really three-hour video, 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, my two-plus hour video, Masters of Terror, two 9-11 films covering different areas of this trigger event that the globalists used.
[02:31:55.523 --> 02:32:01.705]  Then you get George Humphrey's 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame and the Illuminati video.
[02:32:02.808 --> 02:32:05.929]  And Eric Huffschmid's 9-11 Painful Deceptions video.
[02:32:06.409 --> 02:32:08.150]  That's over nine hours of video.
[02:32:09.310 --> 02:32:15.912]  And you get Paul Watson's book, normally $19.95, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Care in the New World Order, for $59.95.
[02:32:16.592 --> 02:32:18.913]  That normally would cost you over $100.
[02:32:18.973 --> 02:32:21.454]  It's a $53 discount.
[02:32:23.234 --> 02:32:25.215]  That's the 9-11 Inside Job Special.
[02:32:26.255 --> 02:32:29.116]  I also have a book special, my book and Paul Watson's book, over 540 pages.
[02:32:32.506 --> 02:32:35.247]  And that is two books for $19.95.
[02:32:35.947 --> 02:32:46.691]  I have my American Dictators video, 115 minutes long on DVD, $95 on VHS.
[02:32:47.031 --> 02:32:52.032]  You get one copy for $19.95, each additional copy for $5.95, as many as you want.
[02:32:53.873 --> 02:32:55.953]  We also have 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny.
[02:32:56.054 --> 02:32:57.334]  This is only a DVD special.
[02:32:59.221 --> 02:33:07.506]  The 170-minute film, The Tour De Force, giving you the big picture of government-sponsored care and where they're going with this.
[02:33:07.546 --> 02:33:10.048]  For $24.95, one copy, each additional copy, $5.95.
[02:33:10.868 --> 02:33:15.331]  So buy one for yourself or if you already have it, buy one and then buy three or four more copies to give as gifts.
[02:33:15.631 --> 02:33:16.952]  Give early Christmas gifts.
[02:33:17.252 --> 02:33:19.013]  And say, look, here's the gift of knowledge.
[02:33:20.314 --> 02:33:22.255]  Or make copies of my films to get them out to people.
[02:33:22.295 --> 02:33:27.078]  But, you know, it's a nice gift if it's an original with a color cover and a nice CD with the imprint on the top.
[02:33:28.007 --> 02:33:28.827]  And all the rest of it.
[02:33:28.847 --> 02:33:30.388]  And then there's a bunch of other specials.
[02:33:31.428 --> 02:33:32.509]  I think we got this posted.
[02:33:32.529 --> 02:33:34.850]  My bumper stickers are now free if you just pay for the shipping.
[02:33:34.870 --> 02:33:35.870]  Fifteen bumper stickers.
[02:33:35.930 --> 02:33:36.630]  Just pay for the shipping.
[02:33:37.531 --> 02:33:38.931]  Infowars.com bumper stickers.
[02:33:38.971 --> 02:33:40.292]  I just want to get the word out.
[02:33:40.952 --> 02:33:41.932]  Time is short now.
[02:33:42.652 --> 02:33:44.933]  We've got a dictatorship now of one party.
[02:33:45.333 --> 02:33:47.174]  Because the Democrats are going along with everything.
[02:33:48.335 --> 02:33:53.957]  Please go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart any of the films.
[02:33:53.997 --> 02:33:54.957]  Or call toll free to get them.
[02:33:55.845 --> 02:33:58.427]  If you missed any of these specials, you can call and ask about those.
[02:33:58.447 --> 02:33:59.147]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:59.167 --> 02:33:59.527]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:33:59.548 --> 02:34:00.368]  Or just write to me.
[02:34:00.388 --> 02:34:03.790]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:34:17.697 --> 02:34:46.208]  And then, of course, PrisonPlanet.TV with my weekly TV special reports, my best audio interviews from the show, special text reports, all 11 of my documentary films, my book, Paul Watson's book you can read online as e-books, a bunch of other documentary films we've been authorized to post, all of that, all of that, hundreds of hours of video, you name it, hundreds of hours of audio, updated on a every couple day basis, 15 cents a day, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:34:48.248 --> 02:34:50.149]  We can fight against this.
[02:34:50.849 --> 02:34:56.993]  Paul Watson, we're about to take five calls and get into news, but any new developments since we had you on, checking in with us an hour ago?
[02:34:57.013 --> 02:35:10.300]  Well yeah, basically Kerry's come out and gave his speech in which he said, quote, in America it is vital that every vote count, but the outcome should be decided by voters, not a protracted legal fight.
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:14.262]  Kerry said, I would not give up this fight if there was a chance that we would prevail.
[02:35:15.177 --> 02:35:20.219]  And yeah, at the same time the internet now is aflame with vote fraud stories.
[02:35:20.699 --> 02:35:21.319]  And it's admitted!
[02:35:21.359 --> 02:35:23.660]  I mean, we're talking about PC World.
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:25.921]  Thousands of admitted scams are reporting on.
[02:35:26.581 --> 02:35:29.002]  People going in and voting for one person and it shows another.
[02:35:29.602 --> 02:35:33.324]  Exit polls showing Kerry winning by 15%, then Diebold gives it to Bush.
[02:35:33.384 --> 02:35:34.664]  I mean, it's incredible!
[02:35:35.645 --> 02:35:36.425]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:35:36.985 --> 02:35:43.308]  On several swing states, and every state that had electronic voting, but no paper trails,
[02:35:44.875 --> 02:35:52.720]  Showed an unexplained advantage for Bush of around 5% when compared to exit polls, when you compare them to actual results.
[02:35:53.380 --> 02:36:03.266]  But in every state that had paper audit trails on their electronic voting, the exit poll results matched the actual results within the margin of error.
[02:36:03.406 --> 02:36:10.711]  So the turnaround from the exit polls to the actual results is solely focused on the electronic voting machines.
[02:36:11.089 --> 02:36:20.820]  I mean I was on the air this time yesterday reading the exit polls and in 13 key states Kerry was clearly leading in 9, Bush in 3 and one was tied.
[02:36:21.601 --> 02:36:30.070]  And so it's looking more and more like Kerry won the election but you know threw it to his cousin and basically there was an agreement which they both knew about.
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:32.421]  And there's more.
[02:36:32.461 --> 02:36:52.171]  I'm about to post an article about how in Cincinnati ballots for 40 precincts were taken to a local public school instead of the election HQ where they were handed over in sealed bags with no record of transfer to these unknown individuals to put them in the back of trailers.
[02:36:52.291 --> 02:36:57.073]  And there's a photograph of one of these individuals loading the sealed bags onto a trailer.
[02:36:57.934 --> 02:37:02.998]  And the trailer has a Bush-Cheney 2004 sticker in the trailer window.
[02:37:03.018 --> 02:37:07.302]  And this is in an area which was expected to heavily vote for Kerry.
[02:37:08.082 --> 02:37:11.425]  And we're getting confirmed reports of this everywhere.
[02:37:11.485 --> 02:37:13.387]  And again, it doesn't mean we're for Kerry.
[02:37:13.727 --> 02:37:15.508]  It shows how it was staged.
[02:37:17.410 --> 02:37:22.494]  And then again in Ohio, around 1am this morning or last night,
[02:37:23.558 --> 02:37:31.292]  The Mayor of Columbus, Ohio, Michael B. Coleman, came out and said that although Bush was leading by 100,000 votes,
[02:37:33.987 --> 02:37:42.973]  He said 190,000 Kerry votes are now coming through from a place called Keoughoga, which is difficult to pronounce.
[02:37:43.033 --> 02:37:47.696]  But he said there were 190,000 Kerry votes on the way and yet they never came.
[02:37:48.096 --> 02:37:53.920]  And then we get all these reports of strange individuals with Bush Cheney stickers loading them on the back of trailers.
[02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:54.721]  Ha ha ha!
[02:37:55.221 --> 02:37:56.302]  And we got photos of it.
[02:37:58.824 --> 02:37:59.745]  Unbelievable!
[02:37:59.825 --> 02:38:03.507]  And then Kerry, who could really challenge this, doesn't challenge it.
[02:38:03.747 --> 02:38:04.647]  Let's take some calls.
[02:38:04.667 --> 02:38:06.908]  Vanessa in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:38:06.948 --> 02:38:07.389]  Go ahead.
[02:38:07.549 --> 02:38:08.129]  Hi Alex.
[02:38:09.770 --> 02:38:12.831]  I've been aware of the New World Order for a long, long time.
[02:38:12.891 --> 02:38:14.272]  I'm 36 years old.
[02:38:14.472 --> 02:38:18.514]  I had an uncle who was a Green Beret, who was in Vietnam, did many, many missions.
[02:38:20.075 --> 02:38:23.297]  When he got out, he went out and started working for the CIA.
[02:38:24.457 --> 02:38:26.838]  And then he knew too much and he had to leave the country.
[02:38:26.898 --> 02:38:28.738]  He was basically expelled from the country.
[02:38:28.758 --> 02:38:29.858]  There was a bounty on his head.
[02:38:30.138 --> 02:38:30.919]  He's since died.
[02:38:31.719 --> 02:38:35.860]  But one of the discussions I can remember as a little girl is, you know, where do you go?
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:36.960]  Where do you go?
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:38.540]  Worst case scenario, where do you go?
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:40.781]  And that's what I want to ask you.
[02:38:41.101 --> 02:38:41.761]  Where do you go?
[02:38:42.341 --> 02:38:43.401]  It's a new world order.
[02:38:43.782 --> 02:38:44.722]  There's nowhere to run.
[02:38:44.742 --> 02:38:45.202]  You only...
[02:38:46.338 --> 02:38:49.220]  I mean, you talk about taking your family out of the country.
[02:38:49.380 --> 02:38:50.061]  Where are you going to go?
[02:38:50.081 --> 02:38:50.721]  Patagonia?
[02:38:51.102 --> 02:38:53.823]  Well, I said I'm not leaving the country if you listen to what I said.
[02:38:54.044 --> 02:38:55.204]  No, no, no, your family.
[02:38:55.244 --> 02:38:59.668]  Yeah, I said if stuff really gets bad, yeah, my family, I'm prepared to get my family out of the country.
[02:39:00.989 --> 02:39:03.690]  But realistically, where are you going to send them?
[02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:10.135]  Well, where I plan to send my family is a private matter, but it's only a stopgap measure.
[02:39:10.775 --> 02:39:14.018]  I'm not going to give people advice on where they should go if they decide to punch out.
[02:39:16.297 --> 02:39:20.841]  You see the problem.
[02:39:21.081 --> 02:39:22.843]  You can only run for so long.
[02:39:25.085 --> 02:39:26.666]  And that's all I have to say.
[02:39:26.706 --> 02:39:27.967]  It's rather discouraging.
[02:39:28.047 --> 02:39:29.228]  I'm a patriot like you.
[02:39:29.248 --> 02:39:31.951]  Well, I'm going to stay in Nazi Germany.
[02:39:31.971 --> 02:39:39.097]  And I'm going to stay here and fight our new Lord Schwarzenegger who will be our President in 08.
[02:39:40.891 --> 02:39:41.231]  Indeed.
[02:39:41.732 --> 02:39:45.735]  If you come to the point, you know, I'm reaching the end of my childbearing years here.
[02:39:45.755 --> 02:39:49.038]  I haven't started a family and I'm not really inclined to.
[02:39:49.238 --> 02:39:50.699]  Well, we need good people to continue.
[02:39:50.739 --> 02:39:55.804]  Life must go on and we've faced greater adversity than this in history and we've got the power.
[02:39:56.696 --> 02:40:00.919]  And, uh, you know, they can try to pull all these scams, but as they pull their scams, more resist.
[02:40:00.939 --> 02:40:03.621]  Look, five years ago, half the people didn't listen to me.
[02:40:03.961 --> 02:40:05.182]  Now everybody listens to me.
[02:40:06.542 --> 02:40:07.463]  Alright, thank you, Alex.
[02:40:07.563 --> 02:40:08.163]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:40:08.224 --> 02:40:13.347]  I mean, and this is my own broadcast and all these AM and FM stations, but I do all these other broadcasts and nobody calls in now.
[02:40:13.367 --> 02:40:14.247]  I mean, it's almost nobody.
[02:40:14.748 --> 02:40:18.170]  Paul, you heard me in England for an hour and a half on the number one talk station in the country.
[02:40:19.269 --> 02:40:27.672]  Goes into Ireland, to Scotland, everything, and into Wales, even into Europe, and not one caller called in disagreeing, even though the host was attacking me.
[02:40:28.132 --> 02:40:29.652]  And that's the same thing that happens every day.
[02:40:29.672 --> 02:40:32.053]  I mean, people just know in their guts it's true.
[02:40:32.073 --> 02:40:33.533]  Paul?
[02:40:33.573 --> 02:40:41.856]  Well, yeah, and I remember you were on that show, you know, probably two or three years before you had maybe three or four that called in to attack you.
[02:40:41.896 --> 02:40:42.736]  Now it's not at all.
[02:40:43.596 --> 02:40:45.557]  So, I mean, it's the same case here in Britain.
[02:40:45.577 --> 02:40:48.378]  I mean, people are more skeptical than ever of government
[02:40:49.207 --> 02:40:56.552]  Maybe not in some states in America, because there's still that kind of naivety that, you know, when Bush says he prays, they believe he really does.
[02:40:56.592 --> 02:40:58.033]  They really believe he's a Christian.
[02:40:58.173 --> 02:41:00.595]  Well, he does pray, but one day, is it to Buddha one day?
[02:41:00.975 --> 02:41:02.016]  Or to the Shinto Shrine?
[02:41:02.076 --> 02:41:04.518]  Or is it to, uh, to, uh, Muhammad?
[02:41:04.578 --> 02:41:06.539]  Or, uh, you know, who we prayin' to?
[02:41:07.340 --> 02:41:10.442]  Or, you know, one day it's Skull and Bones, next day it's Moloch or Lilith?
[02:41:12.864 --> 02:41:16.006]  Well, again, the point about, you know, running for the hills.
[02:41:16.733 --> 02:41:20.074]  I mean, obviously they're going to make it more difficult for anyone who wants to stay.
[02:41:20.794 --> 02:41:24.775]  First of all, buy a national ID card to get any kind of privilege, buy and sell.
[02:41:25.335 --> 02:41:30.016]  And then buy the implantable chip, so they're just going to tighten the vice as long as we stay here.
[02:41:30.696 --> 02:41:40.259]  The problem with trying to leave is that what they call non-integrating states who don't go along with the New World Order... They're going and putting pressure on those... They're the ones who are the primary targets.
[02:41:40.919 --> 02:41:41.899]  Yeah, primary targets.
[02:41:43.382 --> 02:41:48.587]  Whether those states are good or bad, it's hell on earth.
[02:41:48.647 --> 02:41:49.668]  It's called world government.
[02:41:50.829 --> 02:41:58.957]  And we'll have our world leader, and he'll be worshipped, they'll believe Jesus has returned, and he'll be calling himself Jesus from a golden throne, and they'll think it's him, and they can't read their Bible.
[02:42:01.269 --> 02:42:05.171]  Uh, but Paul, do you get my point about how the Republicans have never had this type of control?
[02:42:05.191 --> 02:42:07.371]  I mean, this is the super-maximal majority.
[02:42:07.752 --> 02:42:12.233]  House, Senate, Governors, Judicial, Legislative, everything, Executive.
[02:42:12.854 --> 02:42:15.394]  And, uh, it's gonna be total control!
[02:42:15.475 --> 02:42:17.255]  I mean, and the Conservatives aren't gonna care!
[02:42:17.275 --> 02:42:19.176]  Ha ha!
[02:42:21.077 --> 02:42:21.397]  No one...
[02:42:22.975 --> 02:42:34.122]  I mean, this whole liberal backlash against it, which was Sony anyway, isn't going to do anything either until we realize that both sides are staged, which is what this whole thing was, you know, pointing out.
[02:42:34.142 --> 02:42:39.325]  At least it gave us the opportunity, the fact that they were both skull and bones of the same policies, to point that out.
[02:42:39.345 --> 02:42:41.727]  So, I mean, at least we took the opportunity to do so.
[02:42:41.747 --> 02:42:42.687]  Yeah, I mean, look at this.
[02:42:42.727 --> 02:42:44.789]  Yeah, we're cousins, 15 members each year.
[02:42:44.809 --> 02:42:46.910]  Yeah, our policies are almost identical.
[02:42:47.290 --> 02:42:49.151]  But never mind, you can't see the voting records.
[02:42:49.231 --> 02:42:50.112]  Just shut up!
[02:42:50.652 --> 02:42:54.315]  Let's go ahead and talk to Vince in Indiana, or Illinois, excuse me, go ahead.
[02:42:54.435 --> 02:42:55.076]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:42:55.296 --> 02:42:55.536]  Hello.
[02:42:55.797 --> 02:43:02.763]  I've been listening to your program for the past six or seven years, and you have been documenting this build-up of the tyrannical New World Order.
[02:43:02.783 --> 02:43:05.325]  It's very obvious to anybody that's paying attention.
[02:43:06.025 --> 02:43:10.749]  And I want to wish you good luck tonight on the Coast to Coast radio show with George Norrie.
[02:43:11.850 --> 02:43:13.712]  George Norrie seems like he's a pretty fair host.
[02:43:13.812 --> 02:43:15.513]  I don't know if he's ever seen your videos or not.
[02:43:15.533 --> 02:43:16.414]  Do you know if he has?
[02:43:17.335 --> 02:43:18.316]  I believe so, yeah.
[02:43:18.993 --> 02:43:24.801]  Well, I know the former host of that program, Art Feld, he was always a big disbeliever in the New World Order.
[02:43:25.142 --> 02:43:26.344]  He always poo-pooed off.
[02:43:26.704 --> 02:43:29.849]  Actually, in one of his books, he said that we're going to have to have a New World Order.
[02:43:31.149 --> 02:43:36.373]  Oh, there was always a lot of controversy with Art Bell and, uh... Well, I don't want to get into a bashing fest here.
[02:43:36.573 --> 02:43:45.440]  I'm just thankful that George Norrie is fair and has a diverse crowd on and, uh, it's the fairest mega radio show out there.
[02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:47.942]  Yeah, oh, he's a great host and it's a great program.
[02:43:47.962 --> 02:43:49.883]  It's a mega, mega broadcast.
[02:43:49.903 --> 02:43:58.510]  You could use that program to promote your website, your videos, and, uh, you say nobody ever... The last time I went on there by myself for three hours, we got 25 million hits.
[02:44:00.697 --> 02:44:02.238]  You know what would be great, radio?
[02:44:02.778 --> 02:44:04.299]  You know what would be really great, radio?
[02:44:04.339 --> 02:44:07.040]  You say that very few people ever call in to disagree with you.
[02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:12.063]  Wouldn't it be great if Art Bell called in to disagree with you, Alex Jones?
[02:44:13.423 --> 02:44:14.584]  That would be great, radio.
[02:44:15.004 --> 02:44:16.585]  Well, I don't want to get into a fight.
[02:44:16.725 --> 02:44:19.226]  William Cooper would be rolling in his grave if that happened.
[02:44:19.766 --> 02:44:20.947]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:44:21.207 --> 02:44:24.389]  Hey, listen, it's not about me, folks.
[02:44:25.069 --> 02:44:29.251]  The open door there, they don't censor me, it's so important.
[02:44:30.641 --> 02:44:33.322]  And I think George Norwich is taking the program in the right direction.
[02:44:34.362 --> 02:44:35.183]  Well, let's go ahead.
[02:44:35.203 --> 02:44:36.763]  Paul, do you have any comments on that?
[02:44:38.624 --> 02:44:52.828]  Well, yeah, I listen to it, you know, on occasion, from time to time, and compared to, you know, what it was before and what some of the other similar shows were before, they're all kind of going in the right direction, having the kind of guests on which bring out real information.
[02:44:52.848 --> 02:44:56.529]  And that's because this is the hunger.
[02:44:56.589 --> 02:44:57.309]  This is what people want.
[02:44:58.755 --> 02:45:07.858]  Yeah, because people are kind of moving away from that whole speculative arena of what you might call conspiracy theory or, you know, UFOs or ghosts or whatever.
[02:45:07.898 --> 02:45:26.805]  People are really more hungry for real information that they can prove, because, I mean, the world's becoming more and more uncertain, so they want to get closer and closer to the truth without speculation, so that's the way it's heading, and, you know, it's good, and it's a good show to listen to, and obviously, with 14 million listeners, obviously you're going to get a big response.
[02:45:28.281 --> 02:45:29.322]  I'd say more than that, man.
[02:45:29.342 --> 02:45:31.383]  That's incredible.
[02:45:31.563 --> 02:45:33.624]  That's just stations they have that buy ratings.
[02:45:33.764 --> 02:45:36.526]  I'd say probably half their stations don't buy the ratings, so it's probably double that.
[02:45:37.166 --> 02:45:39.467]  Let's go ahead, because you can't talk about ratings unless you buy them.
[02:45:40.087 --> 02:45:41.028]  Most stations don't buy them.
[02:45:41.508 --> 02:45:45.190]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Michigan.
[02:45:45.210 --> 02:45:46.931]  Dave, thanks for holding her on the air globally.
[02:45:48.012 --> 02:45:48.832]  Hey, Alex.
[02:45:48.872 --> 02:45:54.135]  Regarding the coming, or the incremental, I should say, police state and martial law here in this country,
[02:45:54.693 --> 02:46:00.717]  History, as you have said, tells us about Hitler and others using ruthless criminals to run their military and their police states.
[02:46:01.317 --> 02:46:09.723]  What do you think, this is based on a thought that occurred to me, what do you think if there's a possibility that our military and government could be planning to use
[02:46:10.444 --> 02:46:14.607]  The untapped and huge resource of criminals in our prison.
[02:46:14.627 --> 02:46:15.088]  They already are.
[02:46:15.508 --> 02:46:16.229]  Oh, you didn't know?
[02:46:16.249 --> 02:46:17.049]  In training them?
[02:46:17.309 --> 02:46:17.870]  You didn't know?
[02:46:18.390 --> 02:46:18.931]  No, I didn't.
[02:46:19.251 --> 02:46:20.632]  I've tried to find it.
[02:46:20.712 --> 02:46:21.352]  I've tried to find it a lot.
[02:46:21.372 --> 02:46:24.075]  Okay, well that was the Washington Times article two years ago.
[02:46:24.495 --> 02:46:29.679]  Did you know 20% of our army forces on the ground in Iraq are illegal aliens?
[02:46:30.279 --> 02:46:32.321]  And then they become legalized after a tour?
[02:46:32.361 --> 02:46:37.005]  And did you know that the Washington Times reported that they actually recruit aggravated felons?
[02:46:37.085 --> 02:46:38.025]  Paul, remember that article?
[02:46:38.926 --> 02:46:39.787]  We've got to find that again.
[02:46:40.825 --> 02:46:48.571]  There's several articles on it where, I mean, they go into schools and they kind of try and focus on the most unstable people.
[02:46:49.252 --> 02:46:50.513]  Yeah, no, no, no, this is admitted.
[02:46:51.634 --> 02:46:54.957]  Well, what about 9-V prison?
[02:46:55.017 --> 02:46:59.761]  They are, well, what they also do is somebody commits a crime and they say, okay, join the military and we'll drop the charges.
[02:47:00.541 --> 02:47:00.841]  Wow.
[02:47:01.262 --> 02:47:05.105]  But no, I have confirmed reports where, you talk about a foreign army,
[02:47:06.603 --> 02:47:10.725]  Uh, what is it, 20% of the Army, they're saying now like 50% of the Marines are illegal aliens?
[02:47:11.126 --> 02:47:12.907]  And then most of them are aggravated felons?
[02:47:13.207 --> 02:47:14.648]  That's the Washington Times!
[02:47:16.829 --> 02:47:17.549]  That's pretty scary.
[02:47:17.629 --> 02:47:20.131]  Yeah, if somebody finds that again and emails it to Paul, he'll post it.
[02:47:20.971 --> 02:47:21.151]  Cool.
[02:47:21.491 --> 02:47:22.112]  Anything else?
[02:47:22.592 --> 02:47:23.112]  Nope, that was it.
[02:47:23.452 --> 02:47:23.833]  Thank you, Dave.
[02:47:24.333 --> 02:47:27.455]  Uh, let's talk to Storm in California.
[02:47:27.495 --> 02:47:28.235]  Go ahead, Storm.
[02:47:28.715 --> 02:47:29.816]  Hi, uh, Alex.
[02:47:29.876 --> 02:47:30.556]  Good to talk to you.
[02:47:30.576 --> 02:47:32.958]  Uh, it's funny you mention the saved second coming of Christ.
[02:47:33.018 --> 02:47:35.079]  I do think that will come, but that's not why I called.
[02:47:35.869 --> 02:47:38.170]  Well, that's what the Bible says the Antichrist is going to do.
[02:47:38.210 --> 02:47:41.851]  He's going to say he's the Christ, and that's what it looks like they're setting up here.
[02:47:42.331 --> 02:47:50.413]  Yeah, well, I'm not Christian personally, but I do fear for Christians who will fall for this, and then they'll implement their one-world religion, and they'll impose their values on us.
[02:47:50.513 --> 02:47:51.773]  Their values will become ours.
[02:47:52.873 --> 02:47:59.055]  But I really call to say, I do think the election was staged, but I think it was a genuine infight amongst Illuminati families.
[02:48:00.123 --> 02:48:05.946]  The Windsors versus the Rothschilds, and the Windsors won out, and I think they will be punished by the Rothschilds for it.
[02:48:07.287 --> 02:48:16.871]  I also wanted to hit up, now that Bush is in power and this thing will go full steam ahead, I think that I want to say a scenario and see if you agree with how it'll go.
[02:48:16.991 --> 02:48:22.034]  I think they'll orchestrate martial law and create riots in this country.
[02:48:22.274 --> 02:48:24.095]  They won't have the troops to police them.
[02:48:25.071 --> 02:48:43.598]  They'll bring in the foreign troops, split the country up into eastern and western districts, Atlanta being the capital of the eastern, they got the Olympic bid in 96, Denver will be the western capital, they got the super airport, Washington will become an Illuminati religious capital, and New York will be the capital of the New World Order.
[02:48:43.618 --> 02:48:44.598]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:48:45.928 --> 02:48:47.429]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.629 --> 02:48:50.710]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.851 --> 02:48:54.733]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.793 --> 02:48:59.055]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.375 --> 02:49:02.957]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.077 --> 02:49:05.078]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.678 --> 02:49:08.581]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.621 --> 02:49:13.326]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.506 --> 02:49:16.549]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.729 --> 02:49:19.592]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.073 --> 02:49:26.199]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.719 --> 02:49:30.524]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:51:49.289 --> 02:51:58.938]  Okay, the problem with this thing, this theory that it's a Rothschild-Sachs-Coburt gulf of power split, is that Kerry isn't fighting.
[02:51:59.038 --> 02:52:01.381]  When Kerry has pure proof that the election was stolen.
[02:52:02.321 --> 02:52:03.623]  And it doesn't mean I'm for Kerry.
[02:52:03.703 --> 02:52:04.704]  Get it through your heads.
[02:52:05.124 --> 02:52:05.905]  It's staged.
[02:52:07.567 --> 02:52:08.668]  I don't see this shift.
[02:52:08.808 --> 02:52:09.809]  I don't see this split.
[02:52:10.461 --> 02:52:11.801]  They're in the same death cult.
[02:52:11.961 --> 02:52:13.622]  He's in the Germanic death cult.
[02:52:14.282 --> 02:52:15.382]  Uh, Kerry and Bush.
[02:52:15.522 --> 02:52:17.543]  That's the real dominant power arm.
[02:52:18.743 --> 02:52:28.326]  Uh, and again, the Rothschilds, you know, they're not Dutch, British, uh, or German royalty, but they're married into these houses, and they're, and they're Luciferians.
[02:52:28.766 --> 02:52:34.548]  Uh, you know, so they're not what you'd call part of this, you know, this Jewish power bloc everybody talks about, you know, in this supposed split.
[02:52:34.808 --> 02:52:36.368]  Now that's from real study, folks.
[02:52:36.488 --> 02:52:37.448]  I say what I believe.
[02:52:37.788 --> 02:52:39.789]  And that's from what I know to be.
[02:52:41.031 --> 02:52:45.154]  You know, you talk about making Atlanta the capital, all this.
[02:52:45.194 --> 02:52:50.637]  They have admitted plans to make a western capital, Denver, if there's ever a nuclear strike on DC, that's public.
[02:52:51.237 --> 02:52:59.462]  The Pan-American Union capital, they voted on this in 2001, right before 9-11, is either going to be Miami or Atlanta, leaning towards Atlanta.
[02:52:59.482 --> 02:53:00.323]  So that is true.
[02:53:00.643 --> 02:53:03.405]  There will be a new capital in Atlanta or Miami, probably Atlanta.
[02:53:04.225 --> 02:53:05.226]  Paul Watson comments,
[02:53:07.082 --> 02:53:20.705]  Well, I don't know whether they want to make it that obvious, you know, whether there's a great point to it, but I think there is a kind of fissure within the European Bilderberg and the Anglo-American, you know, sides of the equation.
[02:53:21.205 --> 02:53:28.247]  I mean, Blair privately said to his advisers that he wanted Kerry to win, but, you know, it's not really a strong line, a strong division.
[02:53:29.033 --> 02:53:34.758]  What has happened now in the last ten minutes is that they're talking about John Danforth, the U.S.
[02:53:34.838 --> 02:53:43.266]  Ambassador to the United Nations, replacing Colin Powell as Secretary of State to kind of fuse the U.N.
[02:53:43.286 --> 02:53:45.928]  and the new Bush administration together.
[02:53:46.248 --> 02:53:50.252]  And by the way, he was the chief Waco whitewasher.
[02:53:51.963 --> 02:54:00.129]  Yeah, I thought the name rang a bell, so now they're talking about him seriously replacing Powell in a reshuffle of the Cabinet.
[02:54:02.270 --> 02:54:05.072]  Yeah, and they're talking about Lord Ashcroft leaving.
[02:54:07.614 --> 02:54:14.198]  Ashcroft, yeah, they're also saying Rumsfeld may only stay for another year or less.
[02:54:14.218 --> 02:54:17.701]  His replacement likely to be Condoleezza Rice.
[02:54:18.482 --> 02:54:25.106]  So, I mean, they're going to have a bit of a reshuffle, probably bring a few of the old boys back and maybe elevate Paul Wolfowitz.
[02:54:25.186 --> 02:54:29.589]  So, it's basically going to be the same faces, but just in different positions.
[02:54:30.129 --> 02:54:31.470]  Well, let's look forward four years.
[02:54:32.765 --> 02:54:33.886]  They're going to have a terrorist attack.
[02:54:33.907 --> 02:54:35.789]  They're going to have a constitutional convention.
[02:54:35.809 --> 02:54:37.311]  They don't even need a terrorist attack to do that.
[02:54:37.331 --> 02:54:40.415]  They'll have it on a gay marriage issue or a flag burning or something.
[02:54:40.915 --> 02:54:42.577]  They're going to repeal the 22nd Amendment.
[02:54:42.597 --> 02:54:43.899]  Nobody would vote for Arnold.
[02:54:44.239 --> 02:54:47.363]  But then they're going to have Hillary run, and I predict Arnold Schwarzenegger, 2008.
[02:54:47.403 --> 02:54:48.184]  I really mean that.
[02:54:50.667 --> 02:54:58.976]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, 95% chance, will be the next President of the United States and our road to humiliation will be complete.
[02:54:59.257 --> 02:55:02.100]  We'll have an Austrian cowbird.
[02:55:02.180 --> 02:55:05.163]  Cowbirds kick out the eggs that the bird laid and lay their own.
[02:55:05.583 --> 02:55:10.929]  We'll have an Austrian cowbird in there who says he admires Hitler and loves dictatorships and wants to be worshipped.
[02:55:11.940 --> 02:55:15.182]  He says he hates black people, they're subhuman, and imposes for gay porno mags.
[02:55:15.522 --> 02:55:18.203]  Perfect conservative leader for these sicko neocons.
[02:55:18.383 --> 02:55:35.931]  You will love him, you will worship him, you will love the abortion, you will love stem cell, you will love open borders, you will love gun bans, because he's going to be running against Hillary, and that's going to be staged, because the Bushes and the Clintons work together, they always have, just like George Bush has been protecting Bill Clinton from Pardongate after 9-11.
[02:55:36.071 --> 02:55:38.091]  I mean, after he got into office in 2001.
[02:55:38.132 --> 02:55:38.372]  Go ahead.
[02:55:41.064 --> 02:55:41.644]  Well, yeah.
[02:55:42.245 --> 02:55:51.189]  If it is Arnie in 08, I think they may wait until 12, kind of have Jeb Bush in there to continue the Royal Dynasty for another four years.
[02:55:51.910 --> 02:56:03.195]  But if it is Arnie, then I think you're really going to see the mask come off the face of the New World Order, and that's when a lot of it is really going to be, you know, the boot-stomping on the human face.
[02:56:03.235 --> 02:56:04.976]  It's going to be more in our face than ever.
[02:56:05.296 --> 02:56:05.997]  Well, they want him!
[02:56:07.259 --> 02:56:12.063]  They want him, uh, because he has the archetypal image of a war king.
[02:56:12.323 --> 02:56:13.084]  King Conan.
[02:56:13.745 --> 02:56:14.826]  And that's why they wanted him.
[02:56:16.127 --> 02:56:22.892]  And he's also backed by the Rothschilds, so that, you know, that destroys the whole left-right in-split, you know, argument.
[02:56:22.912 --> 02:56:25.194]  Because he's backed by both sides, basically.
[02:56:25.455 --> 02:56:28.457]  He's been friends with Lloyd Rothschild since 1968.
[02:56:29.918 --> 02:56:30.539]  Thank you, Paul.
[02:56:30.579 --> 02:56:31.220]  Great coverage.
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:32.180]  Back tonight, 9 to Midnight.
[02:56:32.220 --> 02:56:32.701]  Back tomorrow.
