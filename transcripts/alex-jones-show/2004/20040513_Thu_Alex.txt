[00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:06.459]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.180]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:10.022]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:11.423]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:13.134]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.774 --> 00:00:17.457]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:22.100]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:40.092]  Well, my friends, to our listeners globally, all the ships at sea,
[00:00:41.653 --> 00:00:42.974]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:48.136]  It is already Thursday, the 13th day of May 2004.
[00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:58.061]  We're going to have wide open phones yet again here on the broadcast and we're going to cover all of this vitally important news.
[00:01:00.683 --> 00:01:06.486]  I want to get into the oil prices and how we have a global cartel known as OPEC.
[00:01:08.747 --> 00:01:11.228]  The Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries
[00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:18.713]  Which is nothing but a front group for the large oil companies themselves who make the lion's share of the profits.
[00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:28.179]  The western oil companies are pointing their fingers at the Arabs saying that it's those dirty Arabs' fault.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.801]  Everything is always their fault.
[00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.964]  Well, they admit the Arabs only get about twenty percent of the money.
[00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:41.188]  The rest is broken up between the oil companies and on tariffs and
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.481]  The gas stations that sell it to you.
[00:01:46.722 --> 00:02:01.868]  And from Exxon to Exxon Mobil to Dutch Royal Shell, across the board, they're all registering record profits, the biggest profits they have made in their history.
[00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.190]  It is a scam.
[00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.430]  There is plenty of oil.
[00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.992]  They've got their peak oil people out there telling you there's no oil left.
[00:02:11.607 --> 00:02:13.188]  So just accept the high prices.
[00:02:13.308 --> 00:02:15.050]  It has nothing to do with that.
[00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.554]  They flipped a switch and raised the price of oil.
[00:02:21.614 --> 00:02:26.037]  The Arabs said a year ago they were going to reduce production.
[00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:33.383]  And the Western oil companies that own giant oil fields all over the planet, they have cut oil production.
[00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:37.946]  And we're being raped.
[00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:41.693]  And I look back at some of the numbers.
[00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:50.598]  Did you know that in the last 80 years, every time we've had very high energy prices, it's caused a serious recession or depression?
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.761]  And they're telling you that the economy is coming out of it.
[00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.962]  We're going to have to raise interest rates on all of this.
[00:02:59.343 --> 00:03:04.086]  And they're paying three plus dollars a gallon.
[00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:11.949]  Three plus dollars a gallon for gas in many areas of the country.
[00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:18.453]  It's pushing two dollars now in some areas of Texas, and we're right here with the oil refineries themselves.
[00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:27.139]  But they know it's time to rape you, financially, psychologically, physically, if they can get away with it in the government.
[00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:35.244]  They know that you're distracted with the war, distracted with other economic problems, and that they can just have their way with you.
[00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:39.266]  The states are jacking up taxes, fines, fees, regulations.
[00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:42.627]  The cashless society control grid is going into place.
[00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:45.608]  This is just the beginning of the fun.
[00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:53.731]  And as you watch your standard of living disappear, they're going to tell you that you're all alone while everybody else is doing just great.
[00:03:55.972 --> 00:04:02.834]  We'll also get into the Times of London, FBI complained about CIA torture.
[00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:18.492]  Also, they admit that they submerge people, like in the movie Conspiracy Theory, that's an old torture tactic, in a pool of water, in a special chair, until you start panicking and drowning, and then bring you back out again.
[00:04:18.552 --> 00:04:21.374]  I mean, putting the bag over their head basically does the same thing.
[00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:27.617]  And it's used in most major police departments around the country.
[00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.720]  This is one of their favorite little systems,
[00:04:35.293 --> 00:04:43.141]  So everything you're hearing about overseas being legitimized for use against Americans is now being used here.
[00:04:46.324 --> 00:04:47.445]  Isn't that just precious?
[00:04:49.447 --> 00:04:52.891]  So understand, it's not just for all those foreigners who deserve it.
[00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.893]  Our troops are just having a good time.
[00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:57.175]  Blowing off some steam, like Limbaugh said.
[00:04:57.435 --> 00:04:58.576]  Oh, it's for you and your family.
[00:04:58.616 --> 00:04:59.217]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.023 --> 00:05:03.023]  It's finally here!
[00:05:03.163 --> 00:05:04.144]  Spring has arrived!
[00:05:04.344 --> 00:05:07.304]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:10.965]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:19.327]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:05:19.607 --> 00:05:23.328]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:05:23.548 --> 00:05:28.549]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.355]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[00:05:33.556 --> 00:05:37.601]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:44.831]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!
[00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:50.596]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious, secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.

[00:06:01.386 --> 00:06:05.730]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.254]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:14.824]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:14.864 --> 00:06:17.727]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:06:18.027 --> 00:06:22.231]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:29.239]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:31.381]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:42.109]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:47.753]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:48.234 --> 00:06:50.856]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:51.456]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:06:52.017 --> 00:06:53.298]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:02.168 --> 00:07:06.671]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:07:07.031 --> 00:07:11.113]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:07:11.414 --> 00:07:11.954]  We listened.
[00:07:12.274 --> 00:07:17.257]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:07:17.517 --> 00:07:17.998]  We listened.
[00:07:18.398 --> 00:07:21.440]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.400]  We listened.
[00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:25.002]  You asked us to include an emergency light for
[00:07:27.354 --> 00:07:27.734]  I think so.
[00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:56.030]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.446]  Again, my friends, it is the 13th day of May on this Thursday edition.
[00:08:23.466 --> 00:08:26.709]  We're going to have wide open phones yet again.
[00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:38.822]  So much is happening on the geopolitical scene here domestically that I want to give you a chance, as many of you as possible, to talk about any particular news story that you want to discuss, that you want to bring forward.
[00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:45.356]  It's kind of like that C-SPAN Journal they do in the morning where people call in with their news article that they want to talk about.
[00:08:45.376 --> 00:08:46.297]  You're welcome to do that.
[00:08:46.718 --> 00:08:51.102]  You're welcome to discuss any of the stories and articles that I discuss or bring forward.
[00:08:51.843 --> 00:09:01.754]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv, so definitely go check them out today.
[00:09:03.932 --> 00:09:07.374]  Coming up later, you know, I didn't get into chemtrails as much as I wanted to yesterday.
[00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:10.855]  I did cover some of it, but I actually want to read this Time Magazine article about them.
[00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:18.139]  And then I came across the official PlayStation Magazine for video games.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:24.742]  So I got a copy of it last night and just flipped through it.
[00:09:25.442 --> 00:09:28.904]  You're saying, wait a minute, we've got news of torture and beheadings and
[00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:35.129]  Gas prices going over, you know, $3.50 a gallon in some areas of the country.
[00:09:37.586 --> 00:09:39.927]  Why are you getting off into video games?
[00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:55.817]  Because we talk a lot about how the non-fiction print media, broadcast television news shows, cable news shows, have been supporting torture, saying torture is good, promoting torture, saying it's a wonderful virtue, something we need to accept.
[00:09:56.297 --> 00:10:04.922]  Then the dramas, the fiction on television, which is an even more powerful form of propaganda because people turn off their thinking
[00:10:05.783 --> 00:10:19.064]  uh... cap turn off the critical thinking process and just accept it psychologically studies have shown almost every drama they're strapping people down torturing them to death it's good they're doing it to keep us safe
[00:10:20.563 --> 00:10:47.828]  But I remember about three years ago, a game called Dungeon Keeper, and there was in a PC Gamer review, mainstream, just, oh, you're a devil down in a subterranean pit, and you go out to the villages and capture children and torture them to death, and the more pain you cause, the more demonic powers you get, then you build an army of slaves underground to go out and, you know, smash the smiles off people's shining faces.
[00:10:49.699 --> 00:10:57.462]  And there's these games where you rape the woman and then you blow her head off and you get bonus cash.
[00:10:59.402 --> 00:11:06.365]  These are all these Grand Theft Autos and games like that that are out there.
[00:11:07.225 --> 00:11:08.665]  There's a whole slew of them.
[00:11:10.346 --> 00:11:14.347]  And these are, I mean the graphics on these are like animated movies.
[00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:16.108]  It's incredible quality now.
[00:11:17.518 --> 00:11:19.239]  And it's not just children that are playing this.
[00:11:19.319 --> 00:11:20.299]  Adults are playing this.
[00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:23.280]  This is the fastest growing media out there next to the Internet.
[00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:27.462]  There are just hundreds of millions of people in the Western world.
[00:11:28.122 --> 00:11:30.363]  Tens and tens and tens and tens of millions.
[00:11:30.864 --> 00:11:31.384]  What do they say?
[00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:34.685]  Like 70 million people play video games in this country.
[00:11:35.145 --> 00:11:39.027]  So it's not the old days of Pac-Man or Space Invaders or Galaga.
[00:11:40.548 --> 00:11:41.248]  Galaxia.
[00:11:42.248 --> 00:11:44.649]  This is simulated murder, death, torture.
[00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:46.230]  They have games like Deus Ex.
[00:11:47.775 --> 00:11:54.361]  Where they admit the government releases a bioweapon to create a crisis, then they've got the serum and you've got to join their New World Order.
[00:11:54.962 --> 00:12:05.852]  Illuminati, if you're going to get the serum and you kidnap militia members and torture them to death because they're trying to fight the New World Order, you serve the New World Order with pleasure.
[00:12:08.834 --> 00:12:12.758]  Well, last night I bought this magazine at a grocery store.
[00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:18.415]  Then I went to the gym at about 11 o'clock at night to exercise on an exercise bike.
[00:12:19.276 --> 00:12:21.678]  And I flipped through the official U.S.
[00:12:21.738 --> 00:12:22.578]  PlayStation.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.822]  That's the Sony gaming platform.
[00:12:28.763 --> 00:12:33.726]  And about half the games, you go around killing people, killing terrorists, torturing people.
[00:12:34.367 --> 00:12:38.230]  And then I found a game in here called Rainbow Six 3.
[00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.232]  And it's first for PlayStation 2.
[00:12:43.366 --> 00:12:51.630]  And they have UN patches on, and it shows them torturing someone in here, and you go out and you kill the terrorists globally.
[00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.031]  You're a UN death force.
[00:12:55.051 --> 00:13:07.057]  And I remember texting Mars when I was in his office three years ago, three and a half years ago, doing research for my Bohemian Grove film, because he just has huge rooms full of filed mainstream news articles, documents.
[00:13:07.717 --> 00:13:12.319]  There was an army document from the 70s called the Rainbow Brigade.
[00:13:14.258 --> 00:13:27.821]  And it was a Special Forces official document how they were the riders of the Four Horsemen, how they served Lucifer, how they bring the New Age in with death, and how they were the Rainbow Six Group.
[00:13:28.621 --> 00:13:38.343]  And then I open up a magazine, and there's the Rainbow Brigade Six Group, and they've got their UN patches, and they go out and kill the militia leaders.
[00:13:40.131 --> 00:13:50.282]  So your children are simulating killing patriots, defenders, who are the last line against the New World Order, at least on the physical front.
[00:13:52.704 --> 00:13:53.765]  This is the first page.
[00:13:53.865 --> 00:13:54.586]  The suffering.
[00:13:54.926 --> 00:13:56.027]  Prison in hell.
[00:13:56.508 --> 00:13:59.371]  The bars may keep you in, but they won't keep them out.
[00:14:00.931 --> 00:14:29.473]  and uh... the suffering is an all new next generation entry into the action horror genre and the first game of its kind to probe into the very unsettling and seedy underbelly of Maximum Security Penitentiary which is haunted by horrific gruesome apparitions and represented by the unique and disturbing executions that previously befell them take on the role of Tork, an inmate who must face more than just his own inner demons
[00:14:30.524 --> 00:14:31.584]  And it's just incredible.
[00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:40.968]  Then you turn to the next page, and it's Prince of Persia, and it shows him cutting somebody's head off.
[00:14:42.008 --> 00:14:47.371]  The next one, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, and you've got to go out and assassinate and kill everybody for the homeland.
[00:14:48.691 --> 00:14:50.392]  The next thing is Hellboy.
[00:14:50.592 --> 00:14:53.173]  It says Satan is good and he works for the government.
[00:14:53.813 --> 00:14:55.994]  Folks, I'm just going to continue flipping each page here.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.343]  And on this page there's about 20 games and half-naked women running around.
[00:15:02.723 --> 00:15:05.665]  Here's another one, Champions of Norrath.
[00:15:06.586 --> 00:15:15.492]  You go out and kill all the demons and fight with them and just game after game after game of this stuff.
[00:15:15.532 --> 00:15:17.554]  And the point is that I've looked at these games.
[00:15:17.614 --> 00:15:19.975]  I've even tested them out, played a few of them.
[00:15:22.377 --> 00:15:24.418]  And it's just all simulating death and murder.
[00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:25.119]  Here's one.
[00:15:26.448 --> 00:15:30.091]  It's Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Jungle Storm.
[00:15:31.252 --> 00:15:33.493]  And it shows a headline at the top.
[00:15:33.553 --> 00:15:35.054]  It says, Freedom Isn't Free.
[00:15:35.094 --> 00:15:36.375]  And it says, World News.
[00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:37.536]  The newspaper clipping.
[00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:42.680]  Bad weather credited for sudden drop in Colombian cocaine production.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.201]  You see, oh, the covert wars are cute.
[00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:54.348]  It shows troops busting in, killing a bunch of people at a table, preparing cocaine.
[00:15:54.972 --> 00:16:02.077]  Well, in truth, the war in Colombia, two-thirds of the country aren't FARC-controlled, commie-controlled, and that's all left alone.
[00:16:02.097 --> 00:16:02.938]  That's not sprayed.
[00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:05.980]  The cocaine's grown and shipped to the U.S., you know, prepared, processed.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:06.941]  It's all public.
[00:16:08.422 --> 00:16:18.489]  The head of the New York Stock Exchange in 99 was in Reuters, a photo of him hugging the head of the FARC, saying, look, invest your money with Wall Street, which is legal, by the way, loophole, or we're going to have you invaded.
[00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:22.932]  And the commies said no, so they get attacked, you know, the competition gets attacked.
[00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.251]  That's all it is.
[00:16:24.631 --> 00:16:27.173]  But, oh, the average person playing this game, and it shows them.
[00:16:27.193 --> 00:16:36.139]  You go around killing the commies, and it's all covert, and they've got a sports game, and the next one is Final Fantasy X-2.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.401]  Last time she saved the world, this time it's personal.
[00:16:40.222 --> 00:16:52.531]  And, you know, there's all these spirits they've got to deal with, and you turn to the next page, and, you know, it gives you a review of that game, and just over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:16:54.904 --> 00:17:01.289]  Total, uh, here's another game, you know, Dark Alliance 2, and you know, with the dark powers you defeat the enemy.
[00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:10.136]  And then here's another one, Killer Bod, Supermodel Heidi Klum embraces evil in Everything or Nothing, that's the headline.
[00:17:10.897 --> 00:17:11.758]  Embraces evil.
[00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:14.460]  Okay, well let me turn the next page here.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.645]  Uh, it says Gundam, Encounters in Space, that's just a robot game.
[00:17:22.084 --> 00:17:23.626]  And it just goes, oh, here it is.
[00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:25.447]  Taste the rainbow!
[00:17:25.847 --> 00:17:36.156]  PS2 gamers get to patriotically fight terror coming spring and they've got the UN symbol on their arm with rainbow over it.
[00:17:37.777 --> 00:17:47.265]  And there's an image here of one of the rainbow people who is handcuffing somebody about to hit them in the back of the head with a rifle.
[00:17:48.185 --> 00:17:50.067]  Later I want to read some of this.
[00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.651]  Some of the things you do, how you fight for the U.N.
[00:17:55.271 --> 00:17:57.152]  against the evil right-wingers.
[00:17:57.972 --> 00:17:58.692]  Here's another one.
[00:17:59.072 --> 00:18:04.674]  The world's most elite command unit is leaving the jungle only to enter another one.
[00:18:05.114 --> 00:18:06.414]  Fighting the terrorists.
[00:18:06.694 --> 00:18:07.514]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:18:07.554 --> 00:18:10.335]  I mean, just page after page.
[00:18:10.815 --> 00:18:12.136]  Wrath unleashed.
[00:18:12.696 --> 00:18:15.637]  Another game where you're demons and you fight with each other.
[00:18:15.657 --> 00:18:20.278]  On and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:26.157]  Oh boy, should I continue with all of this?
[00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:27.858]  Should I continue?
[00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:29.660]  I don't know.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.341]  I'm going to go back over that later.
[00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:39.088]  I want to come back and get into the torture and the oil prices and the rest of it, but this is just another front of propaganda.
[00:18:40.409 --> 00:18:41.990]  And people are playing these games.
[00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:48.556]  And I have to say, about half the military games they have now, the kill games, you're a U.N.
[00:18:48.596 --> 00:18:49.877]  soldier killing right-wingers.
[00:18:50.666 --> 00:18:56.487]  You know, the games will start out where you're fighting some foreigners, but you always get back to, you know, hanging somebody up and torturing them.
[00:18:56.527 --> 00:19:05.149]  Because you're a good guy, and of course you have implantable chips under your skin to communicate with the satellite systems that empower you because you're this nanotech leader.
[00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.430]  Are you starting to get how bad it is?
[00:19:10.731 --> 00:19:16.592]  Are you starting to realize that people are playing these games and just totally being conditioned?
[00:19:18.354 --> 00:19:19.815]  Very, very serious.
[00:19:20.195 --> 00:19:21.155]  Very, very serious.
[00:19:22.575 --> 00:19:30.438]  Alright, we'll break and come back and I'll get into FBI, a complaint about CIA torture of Al-Qaeda prisoners, and again, Al-Qaeda suspects.
[00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:31.378]  Let's make that clear.
[00:19:31.498 --> 00:19:35.640]  So, because they wouldn't dare actually capture any real CIA officers and torture them.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.881]  They just gotta make it look good to the world and train a cadre of torturers.
[00:19:39.682 --> 00:19:47.930]  The CIA has used harsh interrogation techniques against high-level Al-Qaeda figures, including forcibly submerging them underwater until they fear they will drown.
[00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.031]  It was reported today.
[00:19:49.932 --> 00:19:51.654]  Yeah, that brings in the panic instinct.
[00:19:52.235 --> 00:19:54.297]  Suffocation is one of their favorite tactics.
[00:19:54.857 --> 00:19:57.700]  You'll probably end up having it used on you in a jail someday.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.401]  We'll be right back.

[00:20:53.075 --> 00:20:54.996]  Are you running out of ideas?
[00:20:55.236 --> 00:20:55.876]  Out of time?
[00:20:55.936 --> 00:20:59.238]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[00:21:10.666 --> 00:21:13.507]  Well, think of a song written especially for them.
[00:21:13.807 --> 00:21:21.731]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:25.453]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.

[00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:34.877]  Just listen.
[00:21:43.228 --> 00:21:48.436]  Birthday coming soon?
[00:21:48.857 --> 00:21:49.538]  Anniversary?
[00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:50.760]  Wedding perhaps?
[00:21:51.361 --> 00:21:52.283]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:56.835]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:59.576]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[00:22:11.462 --> 00:22:12.182]  We're good to go.
[00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.630]  I think so.
[00:23:00.032 --> 00:23:01.574]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:02.855]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:23:03.036 --> 00:23:06.459]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.000]  Phenol?
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:14.388]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:23:14.929 --> 00:23:18.812]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:23:18.912 --> 00:23:19.373]  Fragrance?
[00:23:19.753 --> 00:23:24.497]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:24.637 --> 00:23:29.321]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:23:29.562 --> 00:23:32.044]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[00:23:32.364 --> 00:23:35.766]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:23:35.926 --> 00:23:39.488]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:42.050]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:43.070]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:24:08.542 --> 00:24:14.005]  All right, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:15.126 --> 00:24:19.749]  The total free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:19.929 --> 00:24:27.695]  I didn't mean to spend eight minutes or so going over video games.
[00:24:27.755 --> 00:24:30.717]  It's just, everything is bombarded.
[00:24:31.017 --> 00:24:35.500]  It's almost like it's in the air we breathe, the propaganda.
[00:24:36.747 --> 00:24:42.529]  You open Time Magazine up, and we're teaching school children that condensation trails are left at 5,000 feet.
[00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:45.370]  This is a new phenomenon, but it's no big deal.
[00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.191]  Please accept it.
[00:24:46.231 --> 00:24:47.551]  It is changing our climate.
[00:24:48.211 --> 00:24:49.732]  You know, the Associated Press comes out.
[00:24:49.772 --> 00:24:55.454]  Well, NASA admits the Earth is 20% darker, and this is causing things to heat up, and it is the jets doing it.
[00:24:55.734 --> 00:25:01.957]  This didn't happen before, but now ice crystals form at 3,000, 4,000 feet in the middle of summer and stay there all day.
[00:25:02.537 --> 00:25:05.378]  This is scientifically impossible, but just shut up and accept it.
[00:25:06.135 --> 00:25:09.097]  I mean, it's... I'm living in the Twilight Zone here, people!
[00:25:14.801 --> 00:25:17.663]  I mean, how do I even cover an article out of the Times of London?
[00:25:18.623 --> 00:25:19.944]  It's also in the Associated Press.
[00:25:20.424 --> 00:25:23.446]  FBI complained about CIA torture of Al-Qaeda prisoners.
[00:25:24.367 --> 00:25:27.629]  The FBI told their people to not be part of these interrogations.
[00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:31.592]  And at the same time,
[00:25:33.228 --> 00:25:34.890]  I mean, I gotta give people some background on that.
[00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.231]  Al-Qaeda is CIA.
[00:25:36.271 --> 00:25:40.756]  They flew 8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan to safety and paid them off.
[00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:46.962]  They grabbed nobodies and took them to Camp X-Ray for torture, to train our troops how to torture, and to make you think they're doing something.
[00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:48.564]  It's old theater, people.
[00:25:48.584 --> 00:25:49.765]  This is admitted, by the way.
[00:25:50.045 --> 00:25:52.288]  Generals have quit and gone public with this.
[00:25:54.901 --> 00:25:58.564]  But then the average Joe reads, oh they're torturing Al Qaeda, so what?
[00:25:59.165 --> 00:26:06.591]  It isn't Al Qaeda they're torturing, it's some poor person they grabbed off the side of the road who literally doesn't even know how to find America on a map.
[00:26:07.131 --> 00:26:08.592]  Who doesn't know how to read or write.
[00:26:12.135 --> 00:26:12.996]  That's what they're doing.
[00:26:14.837 --> 00:26:20.462]  And it's just so horrible to watch this happen and to see this going on.
[00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:37.812]  And then to know that OPEC is a puppet of the big banks, and to know that they're raping us on oil prices, and then to see them put out their disinfo through the oil companies that, oh, there's no oil left, you're going to pay a lot more now, when there's oil all over the place, giant new reserves being found on a monthly basis.
[00:26:39.434 --> 00:26:45.499]  There is no such thing as peak oil in the near future, I mean the next 50, 60, 70, 80 years.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.483]  Just how they run these scams, just how they get away with it.
[00:26:51.494 --> 00:27:00.260]  And how people gullibly buy into it, and now you get to be raped while the oil companies register record profits in their histories.
[00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:03.723]  This is the type of news we need to talk about.
[00:27:03.763 --> 00:27:13.030]  And then meanwhile, they admit, the Senators admit that there's photos of raping women, beating children, sodomizing people, but none of that's getting released.
[00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.990]  That's not getting discussed.
[00:27:14.031 --> 00:27:17.453]  It's all diverting us onto this England white trash
[00:27:20.811 --> 00:27:21.512]  I'm not going to say it.
[00:27:22.172 --> 00:27:30.840]  Individual, let's just say low IQ individual, going, I was ordered to do this and I was ordered to do that.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:31.900]  Well, obviously you were.
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:32.461]  It's admitted.
[00:27:32.521 --> 00:27:37.065]  But now they're all focusing in on, you know, them having orgies in front of the Iraqis.
[00:27:37.105 --> 00:27:39.407]  I mean, this is just, this is just degenerate.
[00:27:39.427 --> 00:27:40.788]  This is psychopathic behavior.
[00:27:41.068 --> 00:27:45.292]  Psychopaths kidnap people, torture them, have sex in front of them, have sex with them.
[00:27:46.673 --> 00:27:51.275]  I mean, how these neocons can make excuses for this, but we're all diverted off into that now.
[00:27:51.335 --> 00:27:52.256]  Ooh, the sex.
[00:27:52.476 --> 00:27:55.658]  Let's talk about the consensual sex between the guards, between the thugs.
[00:27:55.998 --> 00:27:58.799]  Let's not focus in on raping women and children.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.082]  You still got the public in denial about that when it's admitted in the Army's own report.
[00:28:05.163 --> 00:28:07.604]  So that's what I'm dealing with, and I'm really upset about all this.
[00:28:07.664 --> 00:28:08.264]  I'm sick of it.
[00:28:09.845 --> 00:28:13.267]  It's time for everybody to wake up to what's going on and to break your conditioning.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:30.144]  We'll come back and start going to your calls, but the CIA has used harsh, I thought it was torture, interrogation techniques against high-level al-Qaeda figures, high-level, including forcibly submerging them underwater until they fear they will be drowned.
[00:28:30.184 --> 00:28:31.145]  It was reported today.
[00:28:32.785 --> 00:28:40.787]  Also, it comes out that there was a type of hit list posted on the web mentioning the Berg family's business.
[00:28:42.168 --> 00:28:43.048]  Interestingly enough,
[00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:47.770]  A kind of a hit list of people who were against the coalition.
[00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:54.111]  Very interesting, and of course, they admit, the FBI admits, there were federal lawsuits filed.
[00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:57.912]  The military has admitted in letters that they were holding Mr. Berg.
[00:28:58.252 --> 00:29:00.533]  And then yesterday, they tried to come out and deny it.
[00:29:00.633 --> 00:29:03.053]  Oh, you better deny you held Mr. Berg.
[00:29:03.073 --> 00:29:06.094]  And then 24 hours later, he was in Al Qaeda's hands.
[00:29:07.071 --> 00:29:14.495]  Then a few weeks later got his head chopped off and a lot of doctors are looking at the video and saying, there's not blood spurting.
[00:29:15.555 --> 00:29:17.796]  He cut somebody's head off, there shouldn't be a lot of blood spurting.
[00:29:18.197 --> 00:29:22.759]  They now think he'd already been killed and then they just added the theatric screaming to it.
[00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:25.200]  I didn't think that screaming was loud enough or energetic enough.
[00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:29.382]  And the body just lays there, doesn't flop around or resist.
[00:29:31.764 --> 00:29:34.385]  When you get your hand stuck in something, you're going to start
[00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:36.900]  Screaming and yelling and pulling on it.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.302]  But not this guy with his hands and arms tied.
[00:29:40.322 --> 00:29:41.262]  He didn't even flop around.
[00:29:41.282 --> 00:29:44.344]  They just cut his head off and there's this squealing going on.
[00:29:44.364 --> 00:29:45.645]  This horrible squealing.
[00:29:46.545 --> 00:29:47.386]  Was he drugged?
[00:29:47.486 --> 00:29:47.946]  I don't know.
[00:29:47.966 --> 00:29:48.546]  We'll be back.
[00:29:48.566 --> 00:29:49.687]  We know the CIA killed him.
[00:29:51.808 --> 00:29:52.709]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:54.810]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.412]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.883 --> 00:30:04.306]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[00:30:04.686 --> 00:30:08.610]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.633]  Here at home and abroad, our own war against terror continues.
[00:30:11.933 --> 00:30:12.614]  Important news.
[00:30:12.694 --> 00:30:15.397]  The news you need is sketchy at best when it comes to the mainstream press.
[00:30:15.737 --> 00:30:21.503]  With Grundig's Yachtboy 400PE World Band Shortwave Radio, world news, news that affects you, will be at your fingertips.
[00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:25.767]  The Yachtboy 400PE is rated as the number one portable shortwave radio in the industry.
[00:30:26.087 --> 00:30:37.120]  And for no small reason, when you consider ease of operation and features like over 40 station presets, both upper and lower sidebands, as well as ship-to-shore weather and aviation bands, the Grundig Yachtboy 400PE is fully digital.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.724]  It comes with its own carrying case, external antenna, and a headset for private listening.
[00:30:41.044 --> 00:30:47.471]  Normally retailing for $249, the Grundig Yachtboy 400PE is now available from Cliff Scott Enterprises for only $149.95.

[00:31:01.542 --> 00:31:04.546]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:31:04.887 --> 00:31:13.718]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:18.725]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:19.165 --> 00:31:25.890]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:38.080]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.021]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:05.971]  Old-timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:32:06.211 --> 00:32:11.753]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:32:12.013 --> 00:32:14.333]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:32:14.493 --> 00:32:15.534]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:32:15.694 --> 00:32:25.596]  Too bad the big seed companies became big green companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:32:25.896 --> 00:32:35.406]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:32:35.606 --> 00:32:44.755]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.

[00:33:04.795 --> 00:33:05.356]  Don't worry.
[00:33:05.776 --> 00:33:07.298]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.798 --> 00:33:11.141]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.582 --> 00:33:13.424]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:33:13.444 --> 00:33:18.289]  Mr. Chalibi, the convicted bank robber, I mean, of $300 million.
[00:33:28.832 --> 00:33:40.755]  The top lieutenant of the Shah running torture operations over several decades in Iran is running much of Iraq.
[00:33:40.815 --> 00:33:47.216]  He's the real top lieutenant or henchman of Mr. Bremer, the regional governor.
[00:33:49.457 --> 00:33:55.858]  And it is now being reported that he is under investigation for kidnapping
[00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:57.931]  Torture, you name it.
[00:33:58.271 --> 00:34:00.553]  Oh, surprise, surprise.
[00:34:01.113 --> 00:34:18.647]  You see, if I'm a police officer, if I was an investigator and I was wanting to know who cut Mr. Berg's head off, I would go into the area, find out who had control, find out who has a history of doing this, and that's the first person I talked to.
[00:34:20.268 --> 00:34:25.312]  First person I talked to was somebody who had three and a half
[00:34:25.945 --> 00:34:34.493]  To four decades of this under their belt and who had an entire squad of thousands of killers.
[00:34:37.716 --> 00:34:41.139]  I'm not saying Mr. Chalibi had anything to do with this.
[00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:44.222]  I know the Coalition wouldn't have their men do it themselves.
[00:34:45.951 --> 00:35:01.720]  Wink-wink, nod-nod, snicker-snicker, you get Mr. Berg into your custody, you hold him, he gets released and gets snatched off the street right afterwards, and then some chubby guys in outfits cut your head off!
[00:35:02.961 --> 00:35:05.683]  And the coalition gets a big boost, oh!
[00:35:07.144 --> 00:35:14.468]  But maybe Mr. Chalibi, since he's running things, could tell them who to investigate, or give them some leads, that's all I'm saying.
[00:35:14.955 --> 00:35:17.396]  Let's talk to Mr. Chalib.
[00:35:18.317 --> 00:35:19.298]  Let me dig that article out.
[00:35:19.318 --> 00:35:20.338]  It's deep in the pile here.
[00:35:20.378 --> 00:35:21.459]  I meant to get to that first.
[00:35:21.479 --> 00:35:22.739]  Then we'll go to your calls here in a second.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.422]  We will go over this.
[00:35:26.462 --> 00:35:29.063]  There's OPEC powerless to stem oil price surge.
[00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:30.024]  Yeah, it's the oil companies.
[00:35:32.005 --> 00:35:34.586]  Bloggers doubt Berg execution video.
[00:35:34.686 --> 00:35:35.927]  A lot of doctors do as well.
[00:35:36.007 --> 00:35:40.590]  Rumsfeld's visit to Abu Ghraib prison in the eye of abuse storm.
[00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:42.931]  It's tortured storm, not abuse storm.
[00:35:43.918 --> 00:35:54.181]  We have just... the anti-Jessica Lynch, that's what they're calling her, the evil woman in the shocking videos and photos of her and orgies at the base.
[00:35:55.221 --> 00:35:58.602]  Lawmakers say new photos, abuse photos are disturbing.
[00:35:58.682 --> 00:36:01.403]  One senator said, it is as bad as you could imagine.
[00:36:01.683 --> 00:36:04.564]  Well, the worst case scenario many times over again.
[00:36:04.884 --> 00:36:06.085]  But there's no big discussion of that.
[00:36:06.105 --> 00:36:07.865]  There is video and photos of them raping women.
[00:36:08.785 --> 00:36:10.326]  I mean, how do you make excuses of that?
[00:36:11.667 --> 00:36:13.228]  So we'll be going over that as well.
[00:36:13.649 --> 00:36:16.771]  But Rumsfeld is backing the interrogation methods now.
[00:36:16.851 --> 00:36:18.392]  First they apologize, then they do that.
[00:36:18.752 --> 00:36:21.515]  Beheaded Man's firm was on right-wing enemies list.
[00:36:21.815 --> 00:36:23.376]  You mean neocon enemies list.
[00:36:24.777 --> 00:36:30.001]  Here's the MSNBC article where the lead guy supposedly cutting Mr. Berg's head off a few weeks ago.
[00:36:30.822 --> 00:36:33.083]  Well, it turns out he's been dead for over three months.
[00:36:35.665 --> 00:36:36.746]  So that's some of what's coming up.
[00:36:36.786 --> 00:36:39.808]  But this is from MSNBC.
[00:36:41.624 --> 00:37:02.749]  From Tom Brokaw's Nightly News, Iraq Congress members under investigation, and this Congress again was appointed, the head guy is Chalibi, allegations include abduction, robbery, assault, car theft, and that's why the murder rate has gone up several thousand percent now.
[00:37:03.529 --> 00:37:07.110]  Chalibi's people are just openly mobsters, that's what they are.
[00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.170]  He's a convicted bank robber.
[00:37:09.411 --> 00:37:11.131]  Our allies want him arrested, okay?
[00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:13.702]  It isn't Iran saying arrest him.
[00:37:13.782 --> 00:37:15.844]  It isn't Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:37:15.884 --> 00:37:16.904]  Oh, he's our buddy now, too.
[00:37:16.944 --> 00:37:18.085]  I guess he's not a bad guy anymore.
[00:37:18.265 --> 00:37:18.926]  Being sarcastic.
[00:37:20.387 --> 00:37:28.452]  It says, members of the Iraqi National Congress and its leader, Ahmed Chalibi, were airlifted into southern Iraq the day Saddam Hussein fell.
[00:37:28.692 --> 00:37:31.674]  And they did the little cheering and the cutting down of the statue and all that.
[00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.731]  Chalibi was President Bush's guest at the State of the Union Address.
[00:37:36.351 --> 00:37:44.174]  Even today, the INC gets $340,000 a month from the Pentagon to feed the United States intelligence information.
[00:37:44.554 --> 00:37:51.316]  Again, we should talk to Chalibi about who he thinks might be behind the cutting of the head off.
[00:37:51.656 --> 00:37:52.737]  He might have some information.
[00:37:52.757 --> 00:37:53.517]  He might be able to help.
[00:37:53.937 --> 00:37:55.538]  Just because, you know, he's the intelligence guy.
[00:37:55.558 --> 00:37:56.458]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:37:57.225 --> 00:38:04.287]  But NBC News has learned that members of the group are now under investigation by Iraqi police in Baghdad.
[00:38:04.988 --> 00:38:06.748]  Allegations of abduction.
[00:38:06.988 --> 00:38:07.889]  Abduction?
[00:38:08.869 --> 00:38:10.469]  No!
[00:38:10.769 --> 00:38:15.711]  These boys 35 years ago would pull up in the van and grab you and take you away to be tortured.
[00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:17.332]  I mean, that's what Chalibi does.
[00:38:17.852 --> 00:38:18.532]  It's admitted.
[00:38:19.492 --> 00:38:20.553]  Robbery.
[00:38:20.893 --> 00:38:24.254]  Abduction, robbery, stealing 11 Iraqi government vehicles.
[00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:27.692]  And it lists a whole bunch of other stuff.
[00:38:28.573 --> 00:38:33.257]  And it says an Iraqi police official says one doctor claims he was kidnapped at gunpoint.
[00:38:33.757 --> 00:38:37.580]  They bound him, took him to an unknown place, and after he got back to his house he discovered they took $20,000.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:43.124]  They caught the suspects and they said they were from the INC.
[00:38:43.944 --> 00:38:51.230]  Iraq authorities tell NBC that four INC operatives are under arrest and an arrest warrant has been issued for the INC's chief of intelligence.
[00:38:52.105 --> 00:38:58.906]  The INC confirms its offices were searched six times and 11 cars seized, but officials say they've done nothing illegal.
[00:38:59.246 --> 00:39:01.487]  No, you're just a convicted bank robber, Mr. Chalibi.
[00:39:01.627 --> 00:39:04.287]  You just stole $300 million, okay, from a bank.
[00:39:04.507 --> 00:39:05.788]  You're a very nice person!
[00:39:06.388 --> 00:39:17.010]  There is something going on, which basically is, what it appears to me, is trying to put political pressure on the INC, according to an INC official, Muhar Swatkat.
[00:39:17.839 --> 00:39:27.764]  And it says, all this comes in the wake of findings that key intelligence on weapons of mass destruction provided by Chalibi's group was false, perhaps even fabricated.
[00:39:27.984 --> 00:39:29.585]  Perhaps fabricated?
[00:39:29.925 --> 00:39:31.306]  A convicted bank robber?
[00:39:31.506 --> 00:39:33.387]  The admitted top torture lieutenant?
[00:39:33.687 --> 00:39:36.148]  Oh, he wouldn't... He's a nice man!
[00:39:37.269 --> 00:39:43.652]  In fact, the former head of the weapons hunt, David Kaye, questions why a group that provided fabricated information is still on the U.S.
[00:39:43.692 --> 00:39:44.152]  payroll.
[00:39:44.741 --> 00:39:46.142]  Because they can get things done.
[00:39:46.603 --> 00:39:52.429]  You know, once taken, you know, once taken, excused, says Kay, twice taken, you're an idiot.
[00:39:52.649 --> 00:39:55.052]  And I think we're now at the point of we're really an idiot.
[00:39:55.452 --> 00:40:02.940]  Tonight, a Pentagon spokesman says he knows nothing about the police investigation, but that four million taxpayer dollars going to Chalibis Group is already being reviewed.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.081]  Chalibi!
[00:40:07.742 --> 00:40:12.544]  By the way, they took most of the former Republican Guard Generals who were paid off beforehand, and they run the prisons.
[00:40:12.624 --> 00:40:16.106]  They're the ones in there directing the raping of the children and the women.
[00:40:16.867 --> 00:40:17.587]  This is in the news.
[00:40:17.767 --> 00:40:21.309]  Our troops are under Iraqi General Command.
[00:40:21.329 --> 00:40:23.010]  Well, it goes like this.
[00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.791]  Civilian CIA contractors to protect the CIA.
[00:40:25.851 --> 00:40:28.853]  There's that membrane of plausible deniability.
[00:40:29.777 --> 00:40:34.901]  Iraqi generals, and then our troops under them, and then our generals can't even go in these prisons.
[00:40:37.643 --> 00:40:43.087]  And then, see, they can go after a general, investigate one of our generals, and then the generals are nothing wrong, because they haven't!
[00:40:43.287 --> 00:40:44.808]  And, oh, see, the general didn't know.
[00:40:45.108 --> 00:40:46.149]  It was the troops alone.
[00:40:46.629 --> 00:40:51.552]  And then, in a way, that'll be true, but it wasn't the troops alone, it was the troops under orders.
[00:40:54.194 --> 00:40:55.435]  So, this is disgusting.
[00:40:55.535 --> 00:40:56.456]  This is disgusting.
[00:40:58.692 --> 00:41:01.133]  The Iraqis did, some of them, welcome us.
[00:41:01.173 --> 00:41:02.314]  They hoped things would be better.
[00:41:02.614 --> 00:41:03.555]  The Shiites did.
[00:41:03.595 --> 00:41:04.535]  They were our allies.
[00:41:04.875 --> 00:41:09.318]  And now they're all running around shooting at our troops because they were lied to.
[00:41:09.378 --> 00:41:12.320]  And I don't support what they're doing, but you've got to look at the facts, people.
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:18.743]  Running over their houses, bulldozing their cars, doing all this is not winning the hearts and minds, and it isn't meant to.
[00:41:19.203 --> 00:41:27.428]  Donald Rumsfeld's $7 billion a year program, P2OG, the Proactive Intelligence Group,
[00:41:28.567 --> 00:41:29.147]  Gee!
[00:41:30.168 --> 00:41:30.508]  Say it!
[00:41:30.568 --> 00:41:39.310]  We're going to kill people, we're going to make them hate us, we're going to assassinate, we're going to bomb, and we're going to get people to attack us to have a bigger terrorist threat to expand the war.
[00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:40.791]  This is Rumsfeld!
[00:41:41.371 --> 00:41:41.931]  This is mint!
[00:41:41.951 --> 00:41:50.334]  They're getting our troops killed, we could have gone into Iraq, we could have put a real government in, we could have left them alone, but see, then they'd expect some of their own oil and stuff.
[00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:58.176]  So instead, we're going to be there for another decade, and tens of thousands of troops are going to die, and it's going to never end.
[00:41:58.596 --> 00:42:01.061]  And they're going to put the chilebes and others in control.
[00:42:01.642 --> 00:42:02.383]  Shame on you!
[00:42:03.605 --> 00:42:04.186]  Shame on you!
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:19.023]  Yes, if we were really wanting to go in there preemptively to put in a better government, we'd have said, we're sorry we put Saddam into power, we're sorry we trained him and others at Fort Benning, Georgia, how to torture your children, rape your wives, and we're sorry we gave him nerve gas.
[00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:23.924]  We're going to give you tens of billions of dollars, fix your country, we apologize.
[00:42:24.364 --> 00:42:31.865]  But no, we're going to get this evil guy out who we've never had anything to do with, and we're going to give you freedom, and they come in and put the same people back in power.
[00:42:33.809 --> 00:42:34.449]  That's all it is.
[00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:35.950]  It's pure wickedness.
[00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:36.970]  All right, let's go to the calls.
[00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.591]  Thanks for holding.
[00:42:37.611 --> 00:42:38.771]  I'm going to go to your calls quickly.
[00:42:39.912 --> 00:42:40.952]  Wyatt, Maryland.
[00:42:41.052 --> 00:42:42.052]  Wyatt, you're on the air.
[00:42:42.072 --> 00:42:42.893]  Hey there, Alex.
[00:42:42.933 --> 00:42:46.114]  Listen, just my critique of that video.
[00:42:46.354 --> 00:42:49.115]  I saw it on Tuesday night on your website.
[00:42:49.696 --> 00:42:51.276]  It looked as phony, as staged.
[00:42:51.877 --> 00:42:53.897]  It was a sterile environment.
[00:42:54.117 --> 00:42:54.998]  There weren't any like
[00:42:55.686 --> 00:42:57.607]  Paintings on the wall in Arabic.
[00:42:57.867 --> 00:43:02.950]  It didn't look like a... It looked like a stage, narrow environment.
[00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:11.875]  You know, the same lighting, the same intentional blurring of the lens, like the fat Bin Laden, which they later had to admit quietly in the back of the paper, was a fake.
[00:43:11.915 --> 00:43:12.716]  They won't say who did it.
[00:43:12.976 --> 00:43:21.061]  The fat Bin Laden who gained, you know, 50, 60 pounds with a big nose, you know, twice as big as Bin Laden's, saying, I did it, I carried out 9-11.
[00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:23.322]  It looked like the same producer made it.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:32.165]  Right, well, the fact is, first of all, the picture that they released on television of this Berg in civilian clothes looked like he was about 220 pounds.
[00:43:32.185 --> 00:43:34.626]  He looked like a pretty good stocky boy.
[00:43:34.646 --> 00:43:35.467]  He had short hair.
[00:43:35.487 --> 00:43:38.349]  This guy looked nothing like him at all.
[00:43:38.369 --> 00:43:39.809]  It looked like an Arab.
[00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:46.473]  Well, two weeks in federal custody and then two weeks in Al-Cieda custody, you will lose weight, sir.
[00:43:46.553 --> 00:43:48.375]  Well, I'm sure you will, but here's the thing.
[00:43:48.435 --> 00:43:50.096]  One of us, the family, thinks he's dead.
[00:43:50.336 --> 00:43:50.656]  Okay.
[00:43:52.517 --> 00:44:03.184]  He probably was killed and then had his head cut off, or he could be sheep-dipped as they say, deep cover, he has the intelligence agency MO, being in all these third world countries.
[00:44:03.364 --> 00:44:03.844]  That's right.
[00:44:03.944 --> 00:44:12.310]  And then suddenly, and they do this all the time, it's admitted in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and that's as far back as has been declassified.
[00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:15.371]  Thousands of people have their deaths staged.
[00:44:15.471 --> 00:44:16.391]  This is admitted.
[00:44:16.632 --> 00:44:19.513]  Now, that could be happening, but I'm not going to go there because I can't prove it.
[00:44:19.533 --> 00:44:21.734]  Okay, I'm not going to go there either, but... No, you go ahead and go there.
[00:44:22.154 --> 00:44:23.174]  You've got your rights.
[00:44:23.194 --> 00:44:23.514]  You're right.
[00:44:23.574 --> 00:44:24.655]  I think it's completely staged.
[00:44:24.675 --> 00:44:27.076]  We have no idea who the masks people were.
[00:44:27.756 --> 00:44:28.917]  We only heard audio.
[00:44:29.197 --> 00:44:30.857]  First of all, here's something that's not talked about.
[00:44:30.877 --> 00:44:32.118]  I haven't heard anybody say this.
[00:44:32.618 --> 00:44:34.519]  Where did he get an orange jumpsuit?
[00:44:34.759 --> 00:44:38.561]  Only Guantanamo Bay people, the prisoners down there, have orange jumpsuits.
[00:44:38.821 --> 00:44:39.321]  I don't think the...
[00:44:42.988 --> 00:44:45.750]  I don't want to call him a terrorist.
[00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:57.198]  I hate to disagree with you, but it is a pinkish-orange, Arabic-style, large-sleeved, open woman's clothing, basically.
[00:44:57.298 --> 00:44:58.539]  It's a woman's nightshirt.
[00:44:58.679 --> 00:44:59.940]  Okay, it's a woman's nightshirt.
[00:45:00.921 --> 00:45:02.102]  And the other thing about the blood.
[00:45:02.122 --> 00:45:05.344]  There would have been blood flying everywhere if this guy was alive.
[00:45:05.364 --> 00:45:07.886]  I'll tell you, I've been in a few slaughterhouses many summers.
[00:45:07.986 --> 00:45:09.447]  I worked for a large animal vet.
[00:45:10.097 --> 00:45:12.419]  And I've seen a cow get its head cut off.
[00:45:12.439 --> 00:45:13.879]  I've seen a pig get its head cut off.
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.121]  Blood shoots 15 feet.
[00:45:16.641 --> 00:45:17.542]  Absolutely everywhere.
[00:45:18.602 --> 00:45:23.405]  There's an article in the Washington Post from Tuesday.
[00:45:23.425 --> 00:45:27.408]  It talks about across America, war means jobs.
[00:45:27.808 --> 00:45:33.172]  And they're talking about that in Alabama, one of the largest military uniform suppliers.
[00:45:33.612 --> 00:45:35.633]  They're making 50,000 uniforms a week.
[00:45:36.053 --> 00:45:36.794]  Now think about that.
[00:45:38.129 --> 00:45:41.551]  50,000 a week and there's only 130,000 soldiers there.
[00:45:41.631 --> 00:45:54.537]  Look, they've reinstituted the draft board, the Pentagon's own website, they're getting ready for Selective Service for Women, they've got 12 different draft bills, and the yuppie neocon socialists are still denying that the draft is in the pike.
[00:45:54.837 --> 00:45:55.057]  Right.
[00:45:55.398 --> 00:46:00.480]  And just because they had an AK-47 in that video doesn't mean that the United States troops
[00:46:01.285 --> 00:46:05.609]  Dressed up in... By the way, the Arabs, the mainstream Arab news channels have looked at that.
[00:46:05.849 --> 00:46:07.130]  They never said Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.770]  Right.
[00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:11.513]  What they said is, we can't sit here on our hind ends and do nothing.
[00:46:11.693 --> 00:46:12.934]  That's what the CIA guy said.
[00:46:13.014 --> 00:46:15.016]  Right.
[00:46:15.136 --> 00:46:22.042]  So, because Al-Qaeda means the base, or the fort, that's a close translation, but way off.
[00:46:22.622 --> 00:46:25.604]  You know, it's like I say Wolf, and you go, oh, he said St.
[00:46:25.644 --> 00:46:26.125]  Bernard.
[00:46:26.485 --> 00:46:28.887]  Well, yeah, and also on the local news here,
[00:46:29.358 --> 00:46:35.144]  In the Baltimore area and across the country, heroin is out of sight as a new epidemic drugs.
[00:46:35.184 --> 00:46:36.345]  They've hit record levels, look.
[00:46:36.525 --> 00:46:37.446]  That's right.
[00:46:37.866 --> 00:46:45.433]  Just a few tons a year coming out of there, now it's thousands and thousands of tons pouring out for your daughter to inject and turn into a prostitute.
[00:46:45.674 --> 00:46:46.274]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:47.315 --> 00:46:48.296]  That's right, that's right.
[00:46:48.316 --> 00:46:49.837]  They're shipping the smack in.
[00:46:49.857 --> 00:46:50.778]  Isn't that what you call heroin?
[00:46:50.898 --> 00:46:51.279]  Smack?
[00:46:51.989 --> 00:46:55.211]  Enjoy your smack, your government shipped in smack.
[00:46:55.791 --> 00:46:57.492]  Scott in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[00:46:57.812 --> 00:47:01.534]  Alex, I really appreciated that roundtable you did on Coast to Coast with George Norrie.
[00:47:01.594 --> 00:47:03.575]  Well, email George and tell him to have me back on.
[00:47:03.836 --> 00:47:04.556]  Already been done.
[00:47:04.776 --> 00:47:16.282]  I talked to Linda Howe last night, one of your other roundtable folks, and did she get to tell you what happened to her at the airport, the abuse and the intimidation she fell under?
[00:47:17.223 --> 00:47:18.083]  Well, it's everybody.
[00:47:18.264 --> 00:47:18.864]  Look, I've been
[00:47:19.731 --> 00:47:40.303]  I have seen 85-year-old, I'm not kidding, World War II people wearing their World War II hats, who are with walkers and oxygen, having some foreigner in a green beret-like outfit in the Chicago airport, called Wolverine Security, shoving the old men and ladies around, while people with giant turbans walk right onto the plane.
[00:47:41.363 --> 00:47:41.944]  That's awful.
[00:47:41.984 --> 00:47:46.006]  She said she was threatened with arrest if she didn't cooperate completely.
[00:47:46.582 --> 00:47:48.164]  And they use this as intimidation.
[00:47:48.184 --> 00:47:53.128]  It seems to me we have the right to charge these people with official intimidation and the abuse of their power.
[00:47:53.148 --> 00:47:54.690]  It's called official oppression.
[00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:55.691]  So what happened to her?
[00:47:55.991 --> 00:47:59.735]  Well, I think she should tell her story since she's a reporter with another network.
[00:47:59.755 --> 00:48:03.318]  But you ought to have your producer give her a call and get her to tell her story on your show.
[00:48:04.259 --> 00:48:05.160]  That's a good idea!
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.563]  And I really think we as citizens need to know
[00:48:10.343 --> 00:48:12.584]  Don't let this stick in your throat, although it does in mine, too.
[00:48:12.924 --> 00:48:15.306]  What's expected of us when we go into the airport?
[00:48:15.326 --> 00:48:16.926]  Because none of us want to cause trouble.
[00:48:17.467 --> 00:48:21.749]  Well, they've got articles where they make pregnant women take their clothes off in front of people.
[00:48:22.089 --> 00:48:23.149]  Well, this is what I'm saying.
[00:48:23.449 --> 00:48:28.532]  And we need to know what our rights are, what's expected of us, and let's get the dialogue going so we can get this changed.
[00:48:30.213 --> 00:48:36.596]  I hear you, conservative activists, liberal activists, news people are basically having their names put in databases.
[00:48:37.036 --> 00:48:39.237]  Bad credit, you get pulled out and searched.
[00:48:40.012 --> 00:48:41.253]  I don't mean taking your shoes off.
[00:48:41.293 --> 00:48:43.234]  I mean 45 minute interrogations.
[00:48:43.614 --> 00:48:46.056]  I mean body cavity searches in some cases.
[00:48:46.096 --> 00:48:50.118]  Yeah, I'll give your producer her home phone number if you want to turn me over to your producer.
[00:48:50.899 --> 00:48:52.140]  Oh, so you know her home phone number?
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.001]  Oh yeah, I talk to Lynn on a regular basis.
[00:48:54.161 --> 00:48:55.101]  Now we'd like to have her on.
[00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:56.722]  Yeah, Stephanie, get her number for me.
[00:48:56.742 --> 00:48:57.863]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[00:48:57.903 --> 00:48:58.544]  Okay, thank you.
[00:48:58.564 --> 00:49:00.405]  Stephanie will get that from you, my friend.
[00:49:01.145 --> 00:49:05.668]  Let's talk to... Who's up next here?
[00:49:06.457 --> 00:49:08.579]  Lorraine in California, go ahead.
[00:49:08.719 --> 00:49:10.321]  Hi, I have a question for you.
[00:49:10.341 --> 00:49:18.510]  I saw on the internet, it said that in Skull and Bones, to get initiated, part of the ritual was to kiss the slipper of the Catholic Pope.
[00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:19.190]  Is that true?
[00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:19.250]  No.
[00:49:20.111 --> 00:49:21.212]  Okay.
[00:49:21.293 --> 00:49:24.476]  It was on, I think, the Cloak and Dagger website, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.501]  That's not part of it.
[00:49:26.541 --> 00:49:28.542]  We know what goes on in there.
[00:49:28.582 --> 00:49:31.144]  The Illuminati was actually anti-Catholic Church.
[00:49:32.144 --> 00:49:33.765]  It was German in nature.
[00:49:34.266 --> 00:49:35.346]  They worship Satan.
[00:49:35.386 --> 00:49:37.408]  They do simulated murders outside.
[00:49:37.468 --> 00:49:41.910]  That's been caught on tape by Mr. Rosenbaum at the New York Observer.
[00:49:44.332 --> 00:49:47.454]  It's a Druidic, Germanic death cult.
[00:49:48.217 --> 00:49:56.925]  The Order of Death is its true name, and they get in coffins and are born again, and ask Lucifer to enter their body, and this is what goes on.
[00:49:56.945 --> 00:49:58.266]  Oh, I see.
[00:49:58.787 --> 00:50:01.189]  So that's just made up, then?
[00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:02.991]  Well, I don't know where they got that.
[00:50:03.091 --> 00:50:05.393]  I have no knowledge of that, and I know quite a bit about Skull and Bones.
[00:50:05.573 --> 00:50:08.296]  Well, I do know that the Catholic Pope,
[00:50:08.746 --> 00:50:12.567]  A couple times called for a New World Order and so did Billy Graham.
[00:50:12.867 --> 00:50:18.669]  Yeah, there's no doubt that the Catholic Church, the establishment Protestant Church, is New World Order controlled.
[00:50:19.509 --> 00:50:21.970]  But I'm talking about the founding of Skull & Bones.
[00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:31.013]  At the time that Skull & Bones was founded, it was a different power structure struggling for power against the Catholic Church, at least at many levels.
[00:50:31.273 --> 00:50:35.775]  Oh yeah, well there were preachers in it in the beginning, from what I understand, right?
[00:50:35.795 --> 00:50:37.035]  Well, Adam Weishaupt, yeah.
[00:50:37.796 --> 00:50:42.120]  Well, no, they were actually some Protestant preachers in the beginning.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.463]  I'm telling you, Adam Weisshop was the founder of it.
[00:50:44.483 --> 00:50:45.143]  Oh, okay.
[00:50:45.304 --> 00:50:46.545]  Alright, well, thank you.
[00:50:46.565 --> 00:50:47.285]  Hey, thank you.
[00:50:47.326 --> 00:50:48.026]  Good questions.
[00:50:48.787 --> 00:50:51.690]  Okay, we'll come back and go to more of your calls.
[00:50:52.471 --> 00:50:53.151]  Stay with us.
[00:50:53.171 --> 00:50:54.072]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:54.092 --> 00:50:54.573]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:54.593 --> 00:50:54.953]  InfoWars.com.
[00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:03.687]  Thank you.
[00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:18.970]  I think so.
[00:51:38.763 --> 00:51:39.003]  I think so.
[00:52:00.757 --> 00:52:02.217]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.437 --> 00:52:05.518]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:52:05.658 --> 00:52:09.559]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:52:09.599 --> 00:52:13.840]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.941]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:52:18.081 --> 00:52:19.942]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:52:20.062 --> 00:52:23.403]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:52:23.443 --> 00:52:24.523]  The medical bills!
[00:52:26.145 --> 00:52:28.167]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:52:28.307 --> 00:52:31.351]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:52:31.531 --> 00:52:34.435]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:52:34.895 --> 00:52:41.023]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:52:41.523 --> 00:52:45.328]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:52:45.728 --> 00:52:47.090]  Order your video today.
[00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:48.491]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:52:48.551 --> 00:52:50.794]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[00:52:59.984 --> 00:53:06.208]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:53:06.368 --> 00:53:12.512]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:53:12.813 --> 00:53:21.238]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:28.503]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:53:28.823 --> 00:53:33.626]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:53:33.846 --> 00:53:39.250]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:42.672]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:53:43.013 --> 00:53:50.978]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:54:24.172 --> 00:54:27.033]  Wanted for abduction, robbery, stealing, you name it.
[00:54:27.728 --> 00:54:28.589]  What do you think about that?
[00:54:28.809 --> 00:54:31.892]  He's the great savior of Iraq we've installed.
[00:54:33.913 --> 00:54:36.896]  He's the muscle that can hit hard and hit fast for the globalists.
[00:54:37.837 --> 00:54:39.518]  I'll be talking to Mr. Chalibi.
[00:54:39.638 --> 00:54:43.341]  I bet he can give us some information about stuff going on in Iraq as of late.
[00:54:44.562 --> 00:54:46.424]  Mr. Chaliber.
[00:54:48.477 --> 00:55:02.219]  Your calls are coming up in uno momento, but before I do that, before we go to Chad, and Michael, and Ken, and Tim, and Menondo, or what's that next caller?
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:17.382]  Monaro, I'm sorry, Monaro, and others, I do want to encourage every single one of you, every last scintilla of humanity out there listening to cease instantly your procrastination

[00:55:23.992 --> 00:55:28.855]  The modern printing press is the VHS or DVD info bomb.
[00:55:30.255 --> 00:55:34.918]  My videos, my documentaries are waking up 90% of those that will watch them.
[00:55:35.578 --> 00:55:37.059]  We have a tool that's working.

[00:55:53.078 --> 00:55:56.421]  Jews, the Preservation of Farms, Ownerships, incredible new film.

[00:57:20.972 --> 00:57:24.914]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chad in Virginia.
[00:57:24.954 --> 00:57:25.835]  Chad, go ahead.
[00:57:25.855 --> 00:57:26.695]  Hi Alex.
[00:57:27.015 --> 00:57:27.275]  Hello.
[00:57:29.555 --> 00:57:31.696]  Get your input on a couple of headlines I saw.
[00:57:32.096 --> 00:57:32.916]  Okay.
[00:57:32.956 --> 00:57:37.097]  Like last weekend, late at night, I saw on headline news they had a deal about the U.N.
[00:57:37.117 --> 00:57:39.777]  They're almost starting.
[00:57:43.118 --> 00:57:48.499]  Barricading it, you know, and putting up all the new high-tech barricades there.
[00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:50.479]  Where is the U.N.
[00:57:50.499 --> 00:57:50.940]  doing this?
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.060]  Your phone was cutting out.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:52.960]  I'm sorry, in New York.
[00:57:53.618 --> 00:57:54.359]  At their headquarters.
[00:57:54.659 --> 00:58:14.174]  Yeah, well, courthouses, UN buildings, federal buildings are turning into armored camps, and they treat you like a slave when you come in to do some business there to pay them some finer fee, and it's all part about the bunkering in place, making us the enemy, preparing for more control.
[00:58:15.796 --> 00:58:18.337]  Okay, and secondly, I saw something on the news today.
[00:58:18.377 --> 00:58:33.402]  I thought, you know, people might want to know that I have a baby and it's pretty sickening when you know their agenda, you know, and they put out a warning that children's Motrin has adult Tylenol in it instead of Motrin.
[00:58:36.563 --> 00:58:38.544]  And that can cause a problem for a baby?
[00:58:39.084 --> 00:58:39.444]  Oh yes.
[00:58:40.584 --> 00:58:41.205]  Bad problem.
[00:58:41.965 --> 00:58:42.445]  Kill a baby.
[00:58:44.065 --> 00:58:46.169]  Cause toxic shock in the liver, I guess?
[00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:47.512]  Yeah, oh definitely.
[00:58:47.632 --> 00:58:48.374]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:48.434 --> 00:58:49.897]  We'll talk more about it in the second hour.
[00:58:51.875 --> 00:58:55.158]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:58:55.218 --> 00:58:59.361]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:58:59.642 --> 00:59:02.444]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:59:02.624 --> 00:59:05.026]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:59:05.226 --> 00:59:13.873]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:59:14.053 --> 00:59:15.414]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:59:15.595 --> 00:59:19.718]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:59:19.998 --> 00:59:20.519]  We're good to go!
[00:59:39.036 --> 00:59:39.496]  Big Brother.
[00:59:39.616 --> 00:59:40.337]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:40.377 --> 00:59:41.257]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:41.957]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.466 --> 01:00:05.347]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.367 --> 01:00:09.830]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:14.334]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.958 --> 01:00:29.125]  Alright, my friends, we're now into our number two on this live May 13, 2004 Thursday edition.
[01:00:29.365 --> 01:00:31.987]  This global transmission goes out on the AM and FM dial.
[01:00:32.816 --> 01:00:36.620]  From Providence, Rhode Island to Rochester, New York.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.626]  From Los Angeles, California to Austin, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri to Pensacola, Florida.
[01:00:42.746 --> 01:00:47.691]  From Albuquerque, New Mexico to Denver, Colorado on the AM and FM dial.
[01:00:48.571 --> 01:00:49.953]  That's just some of the great affiliates.
[01:00:51.371 --> 01:01:06.240]  We simulcast on the Global Shortwave during the day at 9475, all three hours now, 9475, and back from 9 to midnight on the Global Shortwave at 3210, 3210.
[01:01:08.321 --> 01:01:15.625]  And one of the biggest Internet audiences, routinely number one out of 3,000 radio stations and networks, on Shoutcast.
[01:01:16.586 --> 01:01:19.908]  One of the biggest Internet audiences in the country at Shoutcast.
[01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:25.825]  You can listen via InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:26.205 --> 01:01:29.746]  Thank you for joining us here on the broadcast.
[01:01:30.766 --> 01:01:34.987]  I want to get back into the torture, some of the new developments with this Nick Berg horrible beheading.
[01:01:35.047 --> 01:01:35.607]  Is it real?
[01:01:35.647 --> 01:01:36.608]  What's really going on?
[01:01:36.628 --> 01:01:38.228]  Is it a CIA op?
[01:01:38.688 --> 01:01:40.468]  All the evidence points in that direction.
[01:01:42.149 --> 01:01:43.609]  I want to get into the oil prices.
[01:01:43.629 --> 01:01:45.089]  I want to get back into chemtrails.
[01:01:45.149 --> 01:01:47.690]  I want to cover an entire plethora, a cornucopia
[01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:50.451]  A spectrum of news.
[01:01:51.431 --> 01:01:52.572]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:01:54.753 --> 01:02:04.097]  Chuck in Virginia was talking about a news report he heard that I didn't see of a particular type of medication, over-the-counter medication.
[01:02:07.097 --> 01:02:08.838]  Adults Tylenol in it for children.
[01:02:09.238 --> 01:02:12.859]  I know you give Tylenol, children's Tylenol to children in lower dosages.
[01:02:12.899 --> 01:02:17.441]  I know high dosages of Tylenol can be bad for children's livers, but what was the point you were making, sir?
[01:02:17.981 --> 01:02:28.104]  Well, first of all, they do make infant Tylenol, but from our experience with doctors, they've said to stay away from even the children's Tylenol and to give them Motrin.
[01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:33.486]  You know, that even the children's Tylenol... Okay, so what was the news saying?
[01:02:33.954 --> 01:02:43.666]  Well, it said that, just a warning, a pharmaceutical warning, that the company said that if you buy Motrin, that you might have adult Tylenol in there.
[01:02:44.467 --> 01:02:45.889]  And that's children's Motrin?
[01:02:46.669 --> 01:02:46.850]  Yes.
[01:02:48.658 --> 01:02:49.719]  Well, that is interesting.
[01:02:49.759 --> 01:02:50.280]  Thank you.
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:51.360]  Anything else?
[01:02:51.821 --> 01:03:03.071]  Well, I just want to say that I'm a proud subscriber to Prison Planet TV, and anybody that just started listening to me in the past couple of months, it's a great thing, because I've already listened to the whole audio archive, and it's just fantastic.
[01:03:03.111 --> 01:03:04.832]  And it's updated every few days.
[01:03:04.932 --> 01:03:07.154]  New video clips going up today.
[01:03:07.174 --> 01:03:08.716]  A new one went up just two days ago.
[01:03:08.736 --> 01:03:11.158]  And I'm going to put one of my speeches up this weekend.
[01:03:11.178 --> 01:03:11.798]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:12.979 --> 01:03:15.702]  Fifteen cents a day at PrisonPlanet.tv, but here's the deal.
[01:03:16.317 --> 01:03:18.398]  We had to upgrade the servers yesterday.
[01:03:18.418 --> 01:03:21.058]  So for a few hours, members couldn't get on.
[01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:21.718]  We posted that.
[01:03:21.738 --> 01:03:23.799]  It was about two, three hours during the day.
[01:03:24.399 --> 01:03:29.201]  And then sometime today or tomorrow, it should be upgraded where new people can subscribe.
[01:03:29.261 --> 01:03:31.741]  So the subscribers can all get on right now.
[01:03:32.421 --> 01:03:37.983]  But we had to upgrade and expand it because we offer so much free stuff on the site that that server was already laboring.
[01:03:38.843 --> 01:03:40.504]  And so we're upgrading.
[01:03:40.524 --> 01:03:42.724]  And then this will only happen maybe every six months or so.
[01:03:42.744 --> 01:03:44.225]  We just have to upgrade it.
[01:03:44.245 --> 01:03:45.665]  And that happens with any system.
[01:03:46.794 --> 01:03:52.075]  And so while we're upgrading, so members can get on, but you won't be able to sign up until tonight or tomorrow.
[01:03:53.235 --> 01:03:59.797]  Believe me, we don't like that either, but you can sign up in the next 24 to 48 hours, not sure how long it'll take.
[01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:14.160]  Okay, because these secure servers with all the firewalls, all the protections, and the certified secure certificate, which is very hard to get, which we have, then when you do work on it or expand it, it takes a lot longer than normal.
[01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:19.072]  Okay, we're going to break here and I want to go to your calls just bam, bam, bam.
[01:04:19.692 --> 01:04:21.133]  We did a great job yesterday.
[01:04:21.193 --> 01:04:23.915]  I think at the end of the show I tallied up all the calls we'd taken.
[01:04:24.195 --> 01:04:25.876]  We took about 38 phone calls.
[01:04:26.136 --> 01:04:26.676]  That's good.
[01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:32.519]  But that means we've got to go to you quickly and I'm bad about elaborating myself and letting you go on and on.
[01:04:32.599 --> 01:04:34.280]  So be ready with your questions.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.440]  Be ready with your comments.
[01:04:35.881 --> 01:04:37.041]  Toll free number to join us.
[01:04:37.061 --> 01:04:38.662]  You can call in when you hear somebody hang up.
[01:04:38.682 --> 01:04:38.742]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:45.619]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:49.980]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.401]  Please stay with us.
[01:04:53.701 --> 01:04:58.022]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:58.222 --> 01:05:02.643]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:02.763 --> 01:05:07.165]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:05:07.205 --> 01:05:08.545]  The New World Order.
[01:05:09.125 --> 01:05:10.687]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:24.082 --> 01:05:34.487]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.687 --> 01:05:40.050]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:44.472]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:05:53.846 --> 01:05:56.870]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:05:57.210 --> 01:06:06.040]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:11.026]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:06:11.486 --> 01:06:18.214]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:06:18.615 --> 01:06:30.389]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:30.869 --> 01:06:35.334]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:06:35.494 --> 01:06:37.917]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:06:37.977 --> 01:06:39.819]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:06:55.717 --> 01:06:59.541]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:06:59.881 --> 01:07:00.682]  Read the labels.

[01:07:42.853 --> 01:07:43.193]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:43.413 --> 01:07:43.974]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:44.074 --> 01:07:44.895]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.568 --> 01:08:05.469]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.489 --> 01:08:10.113]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:14.436]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:14.616 --> 01:08:32.171]  Alright, my friends, back live, eight minutes and thirty seconds into the second hour of global transmission, as we attempt to reveal the true
[01:08:33.015 --> 01:08:39.997]  Power Paradigm of the New World Order as we attempt to defend against this onslaught of dehumanization.
[01:08:40.077 --> 01:08:41.858]  Going back to your calls now.
[01:08:42.658 --> 01:08:45.479]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Washington.
[01:08:45.539 --> 01:08:45.999]  Go ahead.
[01:08:46.019 --> 01:08:47.299]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:08:47.699 --> 01:08:48.019]  Hello.
[01:08:48.039 --> 01:08:51.220]  Alex, I just want to make a couple comments on that video.
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:56.562]  I watched it yesterday and my condolences to the Berg family if in fact he was murdered.
[01:08:58.102 --> 01:08:59.883]  But what I found when I watched it was
[01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:07.134]  The two guys on the left looked awful big, and I just got this gut feeling that if you pulled their masks off, they would be, uh, American.
[01:09:07.734 --> 01:09:12.176]  They were like 6'4", 6'5", guys, and typically, Iranians or Iraqis aren't that big.
[01:09:12.657 --> 01:09:26.643]  But, um, one thing I wanted to point out is that I didn't see any blood either, and a good friend of mine was murdered last summer, and he was dismembered and, uh, with a sawzall, and it came out in court that they had to cut off his head with a pair of bolt cutters.
[01:09:27.443 --> 01:09:33.788]  And I unfortunately had to learn this by going through the court process of watching these degenerates get 30 years for murdering my friend.
[01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:35.449]  They never found his head.
[01:09:35.769 --> 01:09:45.617]  The one thing I noticed was... Well, and notice, they got... People will get 80 years for not paying their taxes, but the average time spent for murder is, what, four and a half, almost five years.
[01:09:45.717 --> 01:09:46.097]  Exactly.
[01:09:46.117 --> 01:09:48.759]  And these guys got 30 years for doing this.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.902]  For doing this to my friend, and they still haven't found his head to this day.
[01:09:51.962 --> 01:09:53.223]  We believe it was an organized hit.
[01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:56.766]  The one thing they mentioned in the court was they used...
[01:09:57.977 --> 01:10:04.625]  The doctor that did the autopsy said that they had to use a pair of bolt cutters to cut through his neck bone.
[01:10:05.206 --> 01:10:07.489]  And they took four or five tries at it.
[01:10:07.869 --> 01:10:09.111]  And I thought that it was awful.
[01:10:09.131 --> 01:10:10.493]  Well that's just because they're idiots.
[01:10:10.653 --> 01:10:14.277]  I've cut a lot of, I've butchered a lot of animals.
[01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:17.041]  Deer and pigs, wild hogs I've shot.
[01:10:17.748 --> 01:10:21.289]  And, uh, you know, a pig's neck bone is similar to a human's.
[01:10:21.929 --> 01:10:26.110]  And you just gotta stick the knife between the vertebrae and just pop it.
[01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:27.571]  Give it a lot of force, it'll pop it.
[01:10:28.231 --> 01:10:31.412]  I mean, these gangsters that killed your friends just didn't know what they were doing.
[01:10:31.712 --> 01:10:35.593]  Okay, well it just seemed to me that that guy went through that guy's neck awfully quick with a Bowie knife.
[01:10:35.633 --> 01:10:39.134]  Well, if you've got a big, heavy, sharp knife, you can cut somebody's head off in about 30 seconds.
[01:10:39.574 --> 01:10:40.494]  Wow, I didn't know that.
[01:10:40.854 --> 01:10:41.915]  Yeah, you can.
[01:10:42.055 --> 01:10:44.195]  But the absence of blood did lead me to believe it.
[01:10:44.215 --> 01:10:48.256]  Yeah, these fat-bellied gangsters that killed your friend are just such idiots, they know how to cut somebody's head off.
[01:10:48.516 --> 01:10:50.096]  Which, I really don't blame them for not knowing.
[01:10:50.116 --> 01:10:51.957]  They just have never, never been a hunter.
[01:10:52.097 --> 01:10:55.798]  You know, it's like the old Hank Williams Jr.
[01:10:55.838 --> 01:11:02.179]  song, Country Boy Can't Survive, I can... I can... Never mind, go ahead.
[01:11:02.679 --> 01:11:07.020]  Well, thanks to Dungeons & Dragons, I think that's what led them to do this.
[01:11:07.947 --> 01:11:16.508]  It's definitely D to my friend, but I noticed in watching that video that there wasn't any blood spraying, and they held Mr. Berg's head up, and it wasn't dripping or anything.
[01:11:16.568 --> 01:11:20.669]  It just seemed kind of past-age to me, as terrible as it was.
[01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:26.490]  You know, I looked at it, and it's got that same blurred look of the fake CIA Fat Bin Laden tape.
[01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:27.030]  Remember that?
[01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:27.450]  Yeah.
[01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:30.231]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:11:30.391 --> 01:11:31.331]  Points are well taken.
[01:11:31.351 --> 01:11:37.652]  I said I'd go to your calls quickly, and I will, but since you brought this up, let me just spend a few minutes on this now for those that just joined us.
[01:11:39.153 --> 01:11:46.920]  We have a government that's been caught planting fake letters from the troops in newspapers all over the country with false signatures.
[01:11:47.841 --> 01:11:51.104]  We have a government who was caught with fake Niger uranium documents.
[01:11:51.124 --> 01:11:59.953]  We have a government using twelve, now thirteen-year-old graduate student papers, certifying them as the latest secret British documents.
[01:12:00.876 --> 01:12:08.523]  We have a government that openly left 7,000 civilians in the Philippines just for propaganda purposes against the Japanese.
[01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:11.006]  4,000 plus of them died in custody.
[01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:20.014]  We have a government that put uranium in the cornflakes of public school children just to see what it would do to them that gave uranium pills to pregnant women.
[01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:20.815]  That's admitted.
[01:12:21.516 --> 01:12:26.080]  We have a government that has people working for them that'll do whatever they're told to do instantly.
[01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:35.059]  They also hire out organized crime groups to carry out their dirty work, like they've been using Mr. Chalibi over in Iraq for enforcement.
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:39.284]  He's got a multi-thousand strong hit team under him.
[01:12:41.346 --> 01:12:44.430]  So the globalists, I mean this is their M.O.
[01:12:45.876 --> 01:12:57.880]  To create a fake killing of Mr. Berg if he was a operative, but he had the CIMO of this humanitarian who traveled around the world helping people in disadvantaged areas.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.121]  But we don't know that.
[01:13:00.121 --> 01:13:02.442]  And we're not getting that from his family, so I don't know.
[01:13:03.322 --> 01:13:09.204]  What I do know is he was in coalition custody for almost 14 days, 13 and a half days,
[01:13:11.169 --> 01:13:15.393]  He gets released, he gets suddenly grabbed by C.I.A.D.A.
[01:13:15.514 --> 01:13:16.775]  I mean Al-C.I.A.D.A.
[01:13:16.795 --> 01:13:18.577]  I mean Al-Qaeda.
[01:13:20.358 --> 01:13:26.925]  And right on time, in the middle of all this torture news, this gets released, I look at who stands to gain.
[01:13:26.965 --> 01:13:32.251]  I mean, if Al-Qaeda was real and really fighting America and the New World Order, they wouldn't be stupid.
[01:13:32.271 --> 01:13:33.472]  They wouldn't do this at this time.
[01:13:34.349 --> 01:13:37.191]  Every time, you know, Saddam says, I don't work with Al-Qaeda, leave me alone.
[01:13:37.431 --> 01:13:38.331]  Ben Laden and New Tape.
[01:13:38.371 --> 01:13:38.871]  Yes, I do.
[01:13:38.891 --> 01:13:39.512]  Don't listen to him.
[01:13:39.532 --> 01:13:40.052]  Yes, I do.
[01:13:40.072 --> 01:13:42.313]  I mean, that's not how this works, people.
[01:13:44.474 --> 01:13:45.835]  So, they could have staged it.
[01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:48.917]  And yes, I remember looking at it, and, you know, you don't see the blood.
[01:13:49.617 --> 01:13:50.598]  They're holding up the head.
[01:13:50.638 --> 01:13:51.798]  There's no blood dripping.
[01:13:52.339 --> 01:13:54.700]  He's squealing and yelling, and they hold the head up, and there's no blood.
[01:13:55.592 --> 01:13:56.313]  And I'm sorry.
[01:13:56.353 --> 01:14:00.815]  I mean, I've shot a deer and got it skinned an hour later after the blood coagulates.
[01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:07.079]  And when you cut its head off and it's hanging up over the gut bucket, there's blood just spilling out.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:11.662]  And again, I've been in a slaughterhouse.
[01:14:11.682 --> 01:14:16.205]  Let me tell you, you cut the mammal's head off, I mean, blood will shoot 5'10".
[01:14:16.325 --> 01:14:18.347]  I've seen it, right when you cut it off, shoot 15 feet.
[01:14:21.071 --> 01:14:32.736]  Normally the head's aimed at the ground, so that doesn't happen, but if it's flopping around and flops its severed neck up, on instinct, you know, off reflexes, and you're ten, fifteen feet away, you're going to get splattered with hot blood.
[01:14:33.756 --> 01:14:35.717]  Believe me, it is very unsettling.
[01:14:37.818 --> 01:14:40.499]  So, could they saw his head off with a large knife?
[01:14:40.599 --> 01:14:41.839]  Yes, if you know what you're doing.
[01:14:41.859 --> 01:14:46.461]  I mean, don't even know what you're doing, just use force, and when you get to the bone, just cut through it.
[01:14:47.836 --> 01:15:01.787]  So that part I don't know, but the blood not spraying, the blood not dripping, that same blurred look, it had the same directorial look as the Fat Bin Laden.
[01:15:03.068 --> 01:15:07.571]  So we have a government that puts out fake videos of Fat Bin Ladens, remember that video?
[01:15:08.112 --> 01:15:10.554]  And later, okay it's fake, we won't say who did it.
[01:15:10.974 --> 01:15:14.857]  We have a government who takes videos of edited people who they admit are dead,
[01:15:15.681 --> 01:15:19.902]  Supposed Al-Qaeda leaders, and then release those and say, oh look, a new videotape!
[01:15:19.922 --> 01:15:23.223]  And then it comes out, oh actually that was edited together, that was old video.
[01:15:24.363 --> 01:15:26.344]  So they're getting caught in lies all the time.
[01:15:26.964 --> 01:15:35.486]  The guy that they claim did the cutting of the head off, who cut the head off, did the beheading, well MSNBC reported that he died weeks before March 4th.
[01:15:35.506 --> 01:15:35.706]  So...
[01:15:41.144 --> 01:15:43.386]  Again, what do you say about all this?
[01:15:43.446 --> 01:15:46.028]  It's very, very suspicious.
[01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:53.894]  The timing, the video, Mr. Berg's lifestyle, what he was up to, what he was doing, it all fits the M.O.
[01:15:54.754 --> 01:15:55.675]  very, very serious.
[01:15:55.755 --> 01:15:57.136]  Okay, let's go to the calls quicker now.
[01:15:57.817 --> 01:16:01.539]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in California.
[01:16:01.579 --> 01:16:02.240]  Ken, go ahead.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.000]  Yes.
[01:16:03.481 --> 01:16:10.446]  The born-again terrorist John Ashcroft is the one that gave the advice to the President and to the administration
[01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:28.008]  That the way to avoid the Geneva Convention was to have the people tortured in other countries, or have Americans in other countries with the foreigners doing the torture, not on either American soil or on supposedly allied soil.
[01:16:28.288 --> 01:16:37.476]  Okay, well sir, you're making amazing points here, but before you go any further, let me open Time Magazine up, this week's Time Magazine, the one that says, how did we come to this?
[01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:44.018]  And in the very front of it, it says, the dangers of a born-again president.
[01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:44.839]  I'm going from memory.
[01:16:44.879 --> 01:16:47.261]  I'm trying to find the actual article.
[01:16:48.142 --> 01:16:51.225]  And look, this is a controlled, false, left-right paradigm.
[01:16:52.822 --> 01:16:59.089]  What they do is they accuse Bush of being this crazy Christian, Ashcroft of being this crazy Christian.
[01:16:59.510 --> 01:17:12.044]  This is all on the surface to manipulate good conservative Christians, and then on the outside it also manipulates the left to think all Christians are bad, to say that born-again Ashcroft, because he's a Christian, said this is wrong.
[01:17:12.945 --> 01:17:19.148]  Your statement that he gave the advice of torturing people in third party countries, that is true.
[01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:19.649]  That's right.
[01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:25.952]  The CIA section chief a year and a half ago in the Washington Post, this is in the torture archive of Infowars.com said,
[01:17:26.505 --> 01:17:27.645]  We're taking them to Jordan.
[01:17:28.186 --> 01:17:29.546]  We're taking them to Egypt.
[01:17:29.906 --> 01:17:33.447]  And we're torturing and living daylights out of them and threatening their families.
[01:17:33.547 --> 01:17:34.027]  That's right.
[01:17:34.287 --> 01:17:36.248]  So, what you said is on the record.
[01:17:36.648 --> 01:17:40.009]  That's what's so frustrating about the government going, we didn't know this was going on.
[01:17:40.429 --> 01:17:42.950]  They've been all over the news bragging about it.
[01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:50.432]  If the news wanted to show file footage of Ashcroft and Rumsfeld bragging about this, they've got it.
[01:17:50.893 --> 01:17:51.333]  That's right.
[01:17:51.473 --> 01:17:51.873]  Go ahead.
[01:17:52.389 --> 01:17:55.513]  Yeah, that's, uh, that's, uh, that's, uh, oh, well, one other thing.
[01:17:55.933 --> 01:18:03.882]  I was talking to, I'm a Vietnam veteran, but I was talking to a man who actually was my personal sergeant when I was overseas.
[01:18:04.503 --> 01:18:12.231]  He was in the service 30 years, E9, okay, that's as high as you can go, Sergeant E9, and he told me that they were doing this in Vietnam.
[01:18:12.371 --> 01:18:13.593]  He was sorry to tell me, but, uh,
[01:18:14.215 --> 01:18:15.216]  He said, this is nothing new.
[01:18:15.596 --> 01:18:35.709]  Well, one of the Senators, the other Senator Kerry, Bob Kerry, on the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, admittedly was a Operation Phoenix commander, and at least 50,000 people, 50,000 were tortured to death, and most of them weren't even Viet Cong.
[01:18:36.469 --> 01:18:43.554]  If a South Vietnamese guy wanted your business, he would accuse you of being a terrorist, you'd disappear, and he'd get your business.
[01:18:44.329 --> 01:18:44.669]  I agree.
[01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:46.510]  That's basically it.
[01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:47.950]  Thank you for the call.
[01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:49.290]  I appreciate your fine points.
[01:18:50.051 --> 01:18:51.331]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:18:51.351 --> 01:18:51.991]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:53.292]  Alex, always a pleasure.
[01:18:54.032 --> 01:18:54.312]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:54.572 --> 01:19:07.756]  Once again, you run down all of these facts, and it just reinforces why I named my organization Truth Teaching and Researching United States Treasonous Hierarchy, because these people in control are going to be the death of us.
[01:19:08.756 --> 01:19:10.737]  I got through to George last night, and I gave you a pump, too.
[01:19:10.777 --> 01:19:11.737]  We thanked him for having
[01:19:12.233 --> 01:19:14.194]  The courage, like you did, to have him on the show.
[01:19:15.274 --> 01:19:17.394]  Did George Norris say he'd have him back on?
[01:19:17.414 --> 01:19:20.055]  Who, you?
[01:19:20.655 --> 01:19:20.895]  Yes.
[01:19:21.095 --> 01:19:22.836]  Oh yeah, you're going to be probably a regular, he said.
[01:19:23.316 --> 01:19:24.476]  Oh, so he said that last night?
[01:19:24.736 --> 01:19:24.937]  Right.
[01:19:25.477 --> 01:19:28.858]  Yeah, because I haven't called him since I was on three or four weeks ago.
[01:19:28.938 --> 01:19:30.738]  I need to call him.
[01:19:30.858 --> 01:19:32.819]  Okay, stay there.
[01:19:32.839 --> 01:19:34.019]  I'll let you finish up.
[01:19:34.039 --> 01:19:35.660]  I don't want to shortchange you on time.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:38.400]  It's page 25 in this week's Time Magazine.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.881]  The Perils of a Righteous President.
[01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:44.990]  This man was born again into the order of death.
[01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:47.795]  He begged Lucifer to enter his heart.
[01:19:48.536 --> 01:19:51.682]  He goes to the Bohemian Grove and worships Satan.
[01:19:51.722 --> 01:19:52.584]  He's not a Christian.
[01:19:53.951 --> 01:19:56.832]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:19:57.172 --> 01:20:00.073]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:20:00.293 --> 01:20:06.495]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:20:06.855 --> 01:20:14.177]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:20:14.357 --> 01:20:18.438]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[01:20:18.718 --> 01:20:24.262]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[01:20:24.462 --> 01:20:37.591]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.

[01:20:53.161 --> 01:20:55.942]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[01:20:56.363 --> 01:20:57.443]  Are you running out of ideas?
[01:20:57.903 --> 01:20:58.524]  Out of time?
[01:20:59.004 --> 01:21:02.186]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[01:21:02.867 --> 01:21:05.708]  Well, think of a song written especially for them.
[01:21:06.008 --> 01:21:13.950]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.

[01:21:26.593 --> 01:21:27.093]  Just listen.
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:40.646]  Birthday coming soon?
[01:21:41.066 --> 01:21:41.767]  Anniversary?
[01:21:42.247 --> 01:21:42.968]  Wedding perhaps?
[01:21:43.569 --> 01:21:44.530]  Mother's Day's coming up?

[01:21:53.115 --> 01:21:57.839]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:21:58.059 --> 01:22:01.501]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:22:01.722 --> 01:22:04.184]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[01:22:04.424 --> 01:22:13.030]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[01:22:13.391 --> 01:22:19.155]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:21.376]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:28.558]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.

[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:42.943]  That's right, for a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.

[01:22:55.484 --> 01:23:00.968]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:23:01.408 --> 01:23:05.631]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:23:05.871 --> 01:23:12.916]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:23:13.297 --> 01:23:19.401]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:20.742]  There are no side effects.
[01:23:21.082 --> 01:23:24.024]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:23:24.184 --> 01:23:26.206]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:23:26.526 --> 01:23:33.751]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:37.454]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:23:42.637 --> 01:23:44.077]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:44.097 --> 01:23:45.818]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:06.596 --> 01:24:16.339]  Okay, we're going to go back to Tim, then Monaro, Tyler, and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.460]  Tim, go ahead and finish up your comments.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:24.202]  Yeah, it seems like all of us are being watchdogs here on this beheading story, and I do agree.
[01:24:24.242 --> 01:24:26.443]  The guys in the background of the picture look huge.
[01:24:26.803 --> 01:24:32.325]  I've noticed sometimes, too, when their sleeves are rolled up, they have these huge, like, Breitling watches, and very expensive watches.
[01:24:32.884 --> 01:24:34.905]  That you can catch in some of the video.
[01:24:35.186 --> 01:24:36.366]  Well, it's not just that.
[01:24:36.486 --> 01:24:43.791]  Look, our government over there had this guy, suddenly releases him, Al Qaeda gets him, and this comes out right on time.
[01:24:44.011 --> 01:24:48.594]  When you hear Al Qaeda, we know that's CIA to begin with.
[01:24:48.734 --> 01:24:49.435]  One after another.
[01:24:49.715 --> 01:24:53.357]  One thing, too, if you look, I recorded it yesterday, and I was looking at the picture.
[01:24:53.397 --> 01:25:01.783]  I can understand him losing weight if he was in custody, but in the picture of him on the news that they showed with the blue t-shirt on, his head,
[01:25:02.355 --> 01:25:07.037]  was much larger than the person that they showed down there, even with the beard.
[01:25:07.477 --> 01:25:08.457]  His head was much larger.
[01:25:08.717 --> 01:25:15.900]  Not only that, Reuters reported that the body was found along a roadside, and CNN reported that the guy was found hanging from a bridge.
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:18.481]  I hear you, I appreciate it.
[01:25:18.541 --> 01:25:19.921]  Listen, I really appreciate the call.
[01:25:19.961 --> 01:25:21.302]  Keep it up, my friend.
[01:25:21.342 --> 01:25:21.842]  Good job.
[01:25:22.642 --> 01:25:24.083]  You're absolutely right, but look.
[01:25:25.703 --> 01:25:27.204]  What we know here is this.
[01:25:28.664 --> 01:25:30.525]  The FBI admits the government had him.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.921]  They admit they interviewed him three times in coalition custody.
[01:25:34.361 --> 01:25:36.302]  The family had to file a suit to get him released.
[01:25:37.042 --> 01:25:38.763]  And then the government denies they ever had him.
[01:25:38.923 --> 01:25:40.043]  That is suspicious.
[01:25:40.943 --> 01:25:42.064]  That is suspicious.
[01:25:42.524 --> 01:25:45.585]  When they're blatantly lying like that, you know there's some fire there.
[01:25:45.945 --> 01:25:47.105]  Where there's smokers, fire.
[01:25:48.046 --> 01:25:48.546]  Thank you, Tim.
[01:25:49.306 --> 01:25:52.067]  Let's talk to Monaro.
[01:25:52.127 --> 01:25:53.328]  Monaro in Texas.
[01:25:53.348 --> 01:25:53.948]  Thanks for holding.
[01:25:53.968 --> 01:25:54.368]  Go ahead.
[01:25:54.528 --> 01:25:54.948]  Hello.
[01:25:55.268 --> 01:25:55.548]  Yes, sir.
[01:25:55.828 --> 01:25:57.369]  I was wondering if you had
[01:25:57.799 --> 01:26:01.362]  Got the information about the President of Chechya's assassination Saturday?
[01:26:01.742 --> 01:26:04.664]  Yeah, the bombing that killed him and what, 70 other people?
[01:26:04.884 --> 01:26:05.144]  Yes.
[01:26:07.186 --> 01:26:08.126]  Yeah, I saw the article.
[01:26:08.887 --> 01:26:15.151]  I was curious about the explosion in India this morning, about the train that melted a 2,000 people town.
[01:26:16.172 --> 01:26:16.932]  Melted the tracks.
[01:26:17.853 --> 01:26:21.596]  Yeah, I've got that article too, it's just horrible, and I mean, what do you think about it?
[01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:26.279]  Oh, it just says that the bombings are fashionable today.
[01:26:28.061 --> 01:26:31.762]  Things are certainly accelerating into this election year, globally.
[01:26:32.203 --> 01:26:32.743]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:26:33.183 --> 01:26:35.544]  Hey, thank you for holding to bring that up.
[01:26:35.584 --> 01:26:36.444]  I've got those articles.
[01:26:36.464 --> 01:26:37.585]  I should go over them.
[01:26:37.985 --> 01:26:39.125]  I dropped the ball on that one.
[01:26:40.025 --> 01:26:43.147]  Let's talk to Tyler in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[01:26:43.187 --> 01:26:44.007]  Tyler, go ahead.
[01:26:44.327 --> 01:26:45.127]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:26:45.207 --> 01:26:45.607]  Fine, sir.
[01:26:45.948 --> 01:26:51.170]  Hey, I just wanted to let you know you've got a big movement here in the West, so let me move on.
[01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:54.871]  William Peter Blatty, who did The Exorcist,
[01:26:56.303 --> 01:26:56.563]  Yes.
[01:26:56.923 --> 01:26:59.684]  He was a psych ops major officer.
[01:26:59.704 --> 01:27:01.685]  In the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:27:01.885 --> 01:27:02.125]  Right.
[01:27:02.906 --> 01:27:05.027]  I met the director and talked to him.
[01:27:05.267 --> 01:27:09.909]  The director did the French Connection and I came to town and I liked the French Connection.
[01:27:09.949 --> 01:27:11.209]  I went and talked to him about that.
[01:27:11.829 --> 01:27:14.010]  He was acting real friendly and nice until I brought that up.
[01:27:14.490 --> 01:27:14.671]  Yeah.
[01:27:15.471 --> 01:27:18.712]  He never did anything before and he never did anything after.
[01:27:19.172 --> 01:27:25.255]  But in the film, in the original version, there's actually cuts
[01:27:26.612 --> 01:27:33.715]  Uh... uh... flashed at a uh... specific rate but also he puts in there the squealing of slaughtered pigs in there.
[01:27:34.295 --> 01:27:42.919]  Yeah, I actually watched the director's cut of The Exorcist with all of the subliminals, but the subliminals were in the first one just shorter.
[01:27:42.959 --> 01:27:46.220]  They put them in there longer in the director's cut.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:55.044]  Right, but what got me to thinking about that is because yesterday you were saying that this was a psych-op thing uh... and that the screams and everything
[01:27:56.263 --> 01:27:58.725]  The the screams on the videotape of Berg.
[01:27:59.826 --> 01:28:09.194]  So that if somebody has the equipment to check the sound to see what's really in there, because I gotta agree with you.
[01:28:09.494 --> 01:28:11.696]  It seems like you know, it's like a Bigfoot video.
[01:28:12.557 --> 01:28:15.259]  It's, it seems like it's a big stage thing.
[01:28:15.659 --> 01:28:17.661]  And I, you know, I'm a hunter.
[01:28:18.762 --> 01:28:22.545]  Hey, when you chop something's head off, there is, I mean, it's a mess.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:33.924]  When you chop something that's been dead for an hour, that you wait till it bleeds out, you shoot it, give it ten minutes, go put it in the truck, drive to the camp, gut it, blood pours everywhere.
[01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:36.064]  But you cut something's live head off.
[01:28:36.164 --> 01:28:37.525]  Yeah, it's a mess.
[01:28:38.025 --> 01:28:38.545]  It's a mess.
[01:28:39.085 --> 01:28:43.147]  And something else I want to bring out about the Illuminati.
[01:28:44.267 --> 01:28:49.669]  He was held for 13 days, and now we have to go back and say, you know,
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:54.022]  Everybody else, that seems like it's not important, but 13.
[01:28:54.063 --> 01:28:55.964]  13 is a very significant number to these people.
[01:28:58.546 --> 01:28:59.627]  Very interesting, though.
[01:28:59.907 --> 01:29:00.767]  I appreciate the call.
[01:29:00.908 --> 01:29:04.270]  I just stick to the fact that he's grabbed by the coalition.
[01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:05.051]  That's admitted.
[01:29:05.291 --> 01:29:07.953]  The FBI says, yeah, we interviewed him three times in coalition custody.
[01:29:08.513 --> 01:29:09.114]  He's held.
[01:29:09.314 --> 01:29:10.094]  Generals admit it.
[01:29:10.114 --> 01:29:11.395]  Then they go, oh no, we never held him.
[01:29:12.436 --> 01:29:19.041]  Then they release him, and Al-Qaeda gets him within less than 24 hours, and then they do this, and it comes out right on time with all this.
[01:29:20.157 --> 01:29:22.058]  And the video's very, very suspicious as well.
[01:29:24.119 --> 01:29:26.900]  We're gonna come back and continue with your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.580]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:35.784]  And don't forget the websites!
[01:29:35.904 --> 01:29:38.125]  I mean, just hundreds of news articles posted every day.
[01:29:38.485 --> 01:29:40.906]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:29:41.166 --> 01:29:41.947]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:44.108 --> 01:29:45.008]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.488 --> 01:29:46.989]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.004 --> 01:29:50.785]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.847 --> 01:30:01.371]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:01.651 --> 01:30:12.556]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.816 --> 01:30:14.617]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:30:14.897 --> 01:30:18.219]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:18.539 --> 01:30:28.984]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:29.304 --> 01:30:29.805]  That's right!
[01:30:29.985 --> 01:30:37.092]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:37.392 --> 01:30:41.516]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[01:30:55.706 --> 01:30:56.666]  Spring has arrived!
[01:30:56.866 --> 01:30:59.828]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:31:00.048 --> 01:31:03.510]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:03.730 --> 01:31:11.875]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:18.082]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[01:32:18.627 --> 01:32:23.071]  Many states offer cash rebates and tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[01:32:23.531 --> 01:32:23.951]  It's easy!
[01:32:24.412 --> 01:32:28.395]  Many of Sunilco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.

[01:32:56.563 --> 01:33:02.587]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:33:03.208 --> 01:33:06.230]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:09.872 --> 01:33:12.154]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:13.174 --> 01:33:15.636]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:16.568 --> 01:33:21.430]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day back from 9 to midnight, My Friends.
[01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:25.091]  And of course a rebroadcast from 1am to 4am as well.
[01:33:26.812 --> 01:33:28.973]  We're going to get back to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:29.293 --> 01:33:33.015]  I want to get into some more of the news right now on several different issues.
[01:33:33.075 --> 01:33:35.836]  You're welcome to call in about any topic you wish.
[01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:36.976]  We don't screen the calls.
[01:33:37.016 --> 01:33:39.137]  It's First Amendment year, My Friends.
[01:33:39.972 --> 01:33:41.593]  It's what we engage in daily.
[01:33:41.653 --> 01:33:43.014]  We can defend our ideas.
[01:33:43.454 --> 01:33:47.917]  We're not like the neo-con-socialist talk shows that screen out people.
[01:33:49.258 --> 01:33:57.543]  All right, a caller called in and said, you know, our Born Again Ashcroft, you know, said we can take people to third-party countries to torture them.
[01:33:57.583 --> 01:33:59.765]  And they've been doing that, by the way, for several years.
[01:34:00.445 --> 01:34:02.046]  But why call them Born Again?
[01:34:02.066 --> 01:34:06.629]  I mean, he's part of this weird brotherhood group that Harper's has written about that
[01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:11.493]  Pays for Senator's homes and stuff and it's basically like a cult up in D.C.
[01:34:11.513 --> 01:34:17.255]  and they laud Nietzsche and all this weird stuff and it's a cult.
[01:34:17.635 --> 01:34:20.836]  But Bush is a member of Skull and Bones, a member of the Bohemian Grove.
[01:34:22.117 --> 01:34:26.378]  You know, prays at Shinto shrines, claps his hands to conjure the demon.
[01:34:27.178 --> 01:34:28.259]  He does all of this.
[01:34:30.099 --> 01:34:32.440]  But then he sits there and prays on TV
[01:34:33.738 --> 01:34:39.342]  You know, like the Pharisee, it'll let you know just how Christian he is while he increases U.N.
[01:34:39.402 --> 01:34:40.323]  funding for abortion.
[01:34:40.623 --> 01:34:44.606]  He'll increase it by several billion and cut 87 million and go, oh look, I cut it.
[01:34:44.986 --> 01:34:46.287]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[01:34:46.907 --> 01:34:57.935]  But this is page 25 out of this week's Time Magazine, the one with the pitch, the artist rendering of a detainee being tortured on the front, and it says, The Perils of a Righteous President.
[01:34:57.975 --> 01:35:02.278]  This is the left trying to demonize Christianity by associating it with Bush.
[01:35:02.976 --> 01:35:06.920]  After his grudging public apology for the behavior of U.S.
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:15.207]  soldiers at Abu Ghraib Prison, George W. Bush attended a ceremony commemorating the National Day of Prayer.
[01:35:15.862 --> 01:35:24.245]  His remarks there were, as we have come to expect from this president, a string of mix of humility and certainty.
[01:35:24.806 --> 01:35:30.308]  God is not on the side of any nation, yet we know he is on the side of justice, Bush said.
[01:35:30.828 --> 01:35:38.571]  Our finest moments as a nation have come when we have faithfully served the cause of justice for our own citizens.
[01:35:39.532 --> 01:35:41.012]  Justice for our own citizens?
[01:35:42.033 --> 01:35:44.814]  A wave of tyranny of darkness is upon us.
[01:35:45.487 --> 01:35:52.612]  This guy admittedly was sworn into the order of death, got on his knees and begged Lucifer to enter his body.
[01:35:52.852 --> 01:35:54.573]  That's the admitted rituals they do.
[01:35:54.873 --> 01:35:57.755]  They've been caught on videotape, flaunting it.
[01:35:58.436 --> 01:36:00.398]  But still you say it's Christianity.
[01:36:00.739 --> 01:36:04.884]  I have video of these world leaders worshiping Moloch in Bohemian Grove, Northern California.
[01:36:05.144 --> 01:36:06.326]  They admit I snuck in.
[01:36:06.526 --> 01:36:07.968]  They admit the video's authentic.
[01:36:07.988 --> 01:36:10.030]  And they say, oh, we're just having fun.
[01:36:10.571 --> 01:36:18.040]  Richard Nixon, the presidential library, just released the tapes, saying it's the most homosexual thing you can imagine going on at the Grove.
[01:36:19.312 --> 01:36:25.598]  And these are the people out there speaking out against homosexuality in public, meanwhile enjoying themselves the Grove.
[01:36:26.078 --> 01:36:27.539]  Am I saying Bush does all this?
[01:36:27.679 --> 01:36:28.360]  Well, no.
[01:36:29.221 --> 01:36:30.582]  Though those stories have been out there.
[01:36:31.402 --> 01:36:39.910]  David Gergen in a 1986 Washington Times article, when the Republicans attacked him for joining Clinton, he said, hey, don't criticize me for the Grove.
[01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:40.710]  I quit the Grove.
[01:36:40.991 --> 01:36:43.133]  I don't run around naked like the rest of you do.
[01:36:44.294 --> 01:36:45.815]  I mean, this is admitted, people.
[01:36:47.578 --> 01:36:50.079]  And so, you know, he's involved in all of this.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:53.801]  Richard Nixon says it's the most homosexual thing on the planet.
[01:36:54.261 --> 01:36:57.242]  They bust in the $1,000 an hour male prostitutes.
[01:36:57.963 --> 01:37:03.225]  You know, they bust in some females too to the nearby hotels in Montereo, in Sonoma County.
[01:37:03.305 --> 01:37:04.145]  Tiny town there.
[01:37:05.446 --> 01:37:06.626]  In beautiful wine country.
[01:37:06.666 --> 01:37:07.787]  I've been there several times.
[01:37:08.347 --> 01:37:10.268]  And I snuck into the Grove back in 2000.
[01:37:10.328 --> 01:37:11.429]  Back in July 15th of 2000.
[01:37:11.949 --> 01:37:14.510]  And this is not Christianity!
[01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:19.678]  You know, carpet-bombing Fallujah isn't Christianity.
[01:37:20.619 --> 01:37:24.721]  Worshipping Moloch... I mean, Leviticus says Moloch is not a Christian angel.
[01:37:25.461 --> 01:37:26.482]  He's not a good guy.
[01:37:26.542 --> 01:37:27.382]  He's a bad guy.
[01:37:27.422 --> 01:37:29.443]  He's Satan's top lieutenant.
[01:37:29.603 --> 01:37:30.624]  He's his top angel.
[01:37:32.104 --> 01:37:33.405]  He's his right-hand man.
[01:37:34.105 --> 01:37:35.426]  Moloch is not very friendly.
[01:37:36.377 --> 01:37:54.964]  So I guess if you believe this is Christian, then shut up a 45 foot stone owl in your Baptist church or your Catholic church, and start bowing before it, bring in a bound mock sacrifice of a child, light it on fire, and conjure the dead members of the church that have been there, and engage in necromancy, and just begin to worship Satan.
[01:37:55.685 --> 01:37:57.445]  Because that's your type of Christianity.
[01:37:58.146 --> 01:38:04.388]  And it goes on, you know, the words are wonderful, but such sentiments are easily corrupted
[01:38:04.989 --> 01:38:11.474]  Faith without doubts leads to moral arrogance, and it goes on to say, this is all the evil Christians that are doing this.
[01:38:12.615 --> 01:38:14.396]  Bush is a set piece in all of this.
[01:38:15.897 --> 01:38:25.204]  I mean, folks, if I had a 45 foot stone owl in my backyard, and I was kneeling before it, worshipping it, and then I put the video out and told you how Christian I was, you would laugh at me.
[01:38:26.024 --> 01:38:26.965]  You wouldn't support me.
[01:38:27.828 --> 01:38:32.734]  If your neighbor was doing this, you wouldn't let them walk your dog or babysit your children.
[01:38:33.134 --> 01:38:35.297]  But this guy supposedly runs the country.
[01:38:36.878 --> 01:38:38.440]  So look out for that.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.103]  This is all being done by design.
[01:38:42.625 --> 01:38:43.486]  And it's disgusting.
[01:38:43.506 --> 01:38:46.009]  Let me get into a few other stories and we'll go to your calls.
[01:38:46.658 --> 01:38:49.640]  This is out of the Times of London, mentioned this earlier, but let me read some of it.
[01:38:50.681 --> 01:38:52.783]  And again, this isn't real Al-Qaeda they're torturing.
[01:38:53.183 --> 01:38:54.685]  It wouldn't be okay if they were doing that to them.
[01:38:55.085 --> 01:38:56.286]  It's bad when Al-Qaeda tortures.
[01:38:56.766 --> 01:38:58.408]  Al-Qaeda's CIA, they're protected.
[01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:01.770]  So when you hear this, this is part of the conditioning process as well.
[01:39:02.351 --> 01:39:05.173]  FBI complained about CIA torture of Al-Qaeda prisoners.
[01:39:05.553 --> 01:39:16.242]  FBI officials are so concerned at interrogation techniques being used by the CIA on Al-Qaeda detainees that they have advised their agents not to take part in many of the interviews it was reported today.
[01:39:17.777 --> 01:39:19.878]  The methods which were authorized by the U.S.
[01:39:19.918 --> 01:39:23.961]  Justice Department after the 9-11 attacks include a technique known as waterboarding.
[01:39:24.902 --> 01:39:29.585]  And you saw that in conspiracy theory, which they did study for that Mel Gibson film of how the CIA tortures.
[01:39:29.665 --> 01:39:35.949]  It's dunking you in water in an apparatus, letting you even inhale some water, bringing you back up.
[01:39:36.049 --> 01:39:37.610]  It engages the panic mode.
[01:39:38.590 --> 01:39:39.311]  And makes you talk.
[01:39:39.791 --> 01:39:41.632]  The method which were authorized by the U.S.S.
[01:39:41.652 --> 01:39:52.901]  Department after 9-11 attacks included a technique known as waterboarding, in which a prisoner is strapped down, forcibly pushed underwater, and made to believe he might drown, the New York Times reported today.
[01:39:53.442 --> 01:39:57.165]  Concern is also growing among CIA officers about the consequences of their actions.
[01:39:57.685 --> 01:40:06.632]  Some people involved in this have been concerned for quite a while that eventually there would be a new president, or a new mood in the country would change, and they would be held accountable.
[01:40:07.933 --> 01:40:12.394]  One intelligence source told the newspaper, now that's happening faster than anybody expected.
[01:40:13.435 --> 01:40:15.295]  Torture's a lot worse, people, than what they're saying.
[01:40:15.915 --> 01:40:25.698]  Again, they focus in on this England girl having orgies in front of the Iraqis instead of focusing on the photos and video, which Senators admit they saw, of women being raped.
[01:40:26.795 --> 01:40:28.396]  And the Tegundi Report admits that.
[01:40:28.816 --> 01:40:32.698]  The revelation is an unwelcome additional pressure for the U.S.
[01:40:32.718 --> 01:40:37.520]  military and security forces, which are facing a major scandal over abuse of prisoners in Iraq.
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:39.741]  An investigation over prisoner abuse by U.S.
[01:40:39.761 --> 01:40:41.922]  forces has also begun in Afghanistan.
[01:40:42.562 --> 01:40:49.786]  The CIA is reportedly concerned that the inquiries into the abuses may lead to examinations of the agency's handling of the Al-Qaeda detainees.
[01:40:51.144 --> 01:40:53.305]  They're letting all this come out now on purpose.
[01:40:53.325 --> 01:40:55.387]  You watch, because they're going to blow something up.
[01:40:55.767 --> 01:40:57.848]  They're going to kill a lot of people in NCC.
[01:40:57.909 --> 01:41:00.470]  We had to do it, and quote, the mood will change.
[01:41:02.231 --> 01:41:04.873]  So that's an article there for you.
[01:41:06.975 --> 01:41:08.035]  Very, very serious.
[01:41:08.836 --> 01:41:10.397]  Bush is saying we'll complete our mission.
[01:41:10.417 --> 01:41:12.558]  Let me get into OPEC here briefly.
[01:41:12.578 --> 01:41:16.401]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:41:16.761 --> 01:41:17.922]  Oil prices
[01:41:18.948 --> 01:41:28.393]  First, new 13-year highs above $40 a barrel on Wednesday on concern that OPEC may not pump enough oil to meet rapidly accelerating world oil demand.
[01:41:30.515 --> 01:41:31.995]  A fresh fall in U.S.
[01:41:32.015 --> 01:41:34.157]  gasoline stocks reinforce concerns that U.S.
[01:41:34.237 --> 01:41:39.280]  refineries will not be able to make enough of new gasoline grades for peak summer holiday driving demand.
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:40.440]  U.S.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:41.381]  light crude
[01:41:42.225 --> 01:41:53.215]  Hit a peak of $48.77 a barrel, less than 40 cents off the 41.15 all-time high of New York crude futures reached in October of 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
[01:41:53.976 --> 01:41:55.317]  That only went on for about three months.
[01:41:56.038 --> 01:42:00.782]  London's Brett crude prices was up 36 cents to $37.72 a barrel.
[01:42:00.802 --> 01:42:03.365]  But notice they pay $5, $6, $7, $8 a gallon in England.
[01:42:06.525 --> 01:42:08.869]  The oil's cheaper for them in England, but they pay more.
[01:42:09.210 --> 01:42:12.675]  That's because of the government and the oil companies, because they'll accept the raping.
[01:42:13.977 --> 01:42:19.046]  Now again, only about 20% of this increase, this is the oil company's own numbers,
[01:42:19.674 --> 01:42:20.615]  Is going to the Arabs.
[01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:25.779]  The lion's share goes to the oil companies that are posting their biggest profits ever.
[01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:28.341]  They won't let us have the oil out of the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:42:28.381 --> 01:42:29.762]  About 80% of that's off limits.
[01:42:30.062 --> 01:42:34.886]  They won't let us have the oil out of Alaska enough to run this country conservatively for 60 to 100 years.
[01:42:35.386 --> 01:42:36.948]  They won't let us have any of it!
[01:42:37.108 --> 01:42:37.768]  It's a fraud!
[01:42:37.808 --> 01:42:39.870]  We got oil coming out of our ears!
[01:42:40.210 --> 01:42:42.292]  Stop buying the oil company propaganda!
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:50.585]  And also, a reason that some of this is going up, part of it is the reduction in the dollars value.
[01:42:50.645 --> 01:42:52.126]  It takes more dollars to buy the oil.
[01:42:52.186 --> 01:42:56.609]  So it's not all OPEC, it's not all the oil companies, but they are making record profits.
[01:42:59.871 --> 01:43:01.713]  So that's going on right there as well.
[01:43:04.595 --> 01:43:06.716]  Let's go into Rumsfeld.
[01:43:06.816 --> 01:43:09.378]  Well, we'll get into Rumsfeld and some other stuff here in a minute.
[01:43:10.559 --> 01:43:12.300]  Visiting the Abu Ghraib prison.
[01:43:12.944 --> 01:43:15.066]  Right now, let's go ahead and take calls.
[01:43:15.667 --> 01:43:16.387]  Pardon me, Stephanie?
[01:43:17.168 --> 01:43:18.529]  Tim just hung up as I was going to him.
[01:43:18.549 --> 01:43:19.070]  Okay, thank you.
[01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:21.492]  Dan in Michigan, go ahead.
[01:43:21.552 --> 01:43:22.412]  Or Missouri, excuse me.
[01:43:22.432 --> 01:43:24.354]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[01:43:24.494 --> 01:43:24.895]  Fine, sir.
[01:43:26.396 --> 01:43:29.379]  I'm old enough to remember when they put in the Alaskan Pipeline.
[01:43:29.839 --> 01:43:30.179]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:33.903]  And the big argument that I remember was against the
[01:43:34.946 --> 01:43:35.806]  The environmentalists.
[01:43:35.906 --> 01:43:39.248]  We need that oil so we'll be independent of foreign oil.
[01:43:39.308 --> 01:43:40.048]  Do you remember that?
[01:43:40.348 --> 01:43:46.791]  And Bush has the House, the Senate, he has the Executive, he has the Judiciary.
[01:43:47.212 --> 01:43:59.197]  That oil could be instantly flowing to California, but the problem is, there's so much crude up there, right at the surface, that it would drive California oil prices down to 90 cents a gallon overnight.
[01:43:59.657 --> 01:44:01.799]  Alex, I heard that from somebody, and you're the first person
[01:44:21.292 --> 01:44:24.796]  I have tried to get this information from my local representatives.
[01:44:24.836 --> 01:44:25.798]  What do you mean it's admitted?
[01:44:26.018 --> 01:44:27.279]  I've seen many news articles.
[01:44:27.339 --> 01:44:29.262]  No, that oil doesn't ship here.
[01:44:30.776 --> 01:44:32.517]  It's only two companies are allowed to have it.
[01:44:32.917 --> 01:44:34.738]  Only two fields in the whole country.
[01:44:35.339 --> 01:44:37.280]  And it all goes to the East.
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:41.923]  So when they sell it, does a private company get the money that they sell it for?
[01:44:41.983 --> 01:44:42.143]  Yes.
[01:44:42.343 --> 01:44:44.425]  OPEC has no involvement.
[01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:47.487]  OPEC has no involvement in all this offshore stuff.
[01:44:48.047 --> 01:44:53.711]  OPEC's not involved in Russia, where they find fields bigger than Saudi Arabia every year there.
[01:44:54.540 --> 01:45:01.143]  So our United States government isn't selling the oil, it's an independent oil company that's selling it to China and Japan?
[01:45:01.363 --> 01:45:02.444]  Yes.
[01:45:02.844 --> 01:45:05.425]  We've had former oil company execs on this show, sir.
[01:45:06.325 --> 01:45:07.746]  The deals were made in the 70s.
[01:45:10.147 --> 01:45:11.447]  God, that just burns me.
[01:45:11.928 --> 01:45:17.390]  We're paying $1.84 right now in Missouri, and that's probably one of the lowest gas prices across the nation.
[01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:18.250]  It is.
[01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:19.791]  That's what we're paying here in Texas.
[01:45:20.371 --> 01:45:21.592]  But that's still pathetic.
[01:45:22.512 --> 01:45:33.260]  When they told us, they said, we've got enough oil up there to run this country for a hundred years, we need this pipeline, and the environmentalists were screaming it was going to mess up the caribou migration.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:41.205]  You notice they use them as the set piece, but notice now they don't talk about the environmentalists stopping it now on Neocon Radio, because Bush isn't doing it!
[01:45:41.366 --> 01:45:43.287]  Because they're making too much money out of it!
[01:45:44.017 --> 01:45:46.681]  Look, look, see people think it's all about supply and demand.
[01:45:47.101 --> 01:45:50.546]  Not in cartels, not in oligopolies and monopolies.
[01:45:51.006 --> 01:45:52.849]  That's what these global cartels are about.
[01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:59.151]  There's more oil out of OPEC control than there is under OPEC control.
[01:45:59.271 --> 01:46:00.232]  OPEC is nothing.
[01:46:00.692 --> 01:46:04.313]  Look, the Globalist White Papers said five years ago that I saw them right on air.
[01:46:04.733 --> 01:46:07.094]  We're going to tell you there's no fresh water, double the price.
[01:46:07.614 --> 01:46:10.696]  That's what they do when they go into a third world country when the IMF and World Bank blows it out.
[01:46:11.056 --> 01:46:13.457]  Enron triples the price in Argentina.
[01:46:13.977 --> 01:46:15.877]  They tell you there's no more oil.
[01:46:16.018 --> 01:46:17.638]  Then they put out the false propaganda.
[01:46:17.658 --> 01:46:18.338]  You accept it.
[01:46:18.899 --> 01:46:19.919]  It's just like diamonds.
[01:46:20.439 --> 01:46:22.180]  There are warehouses in France
[01:46:23.478 --> 01:46:24.759]  And in Holland and other areas.
[01:46:24.779 --> 01:46:25.659]  This is on PBS.
[01:46:25.939 --> 01:46:26.940]  I have a documentary on tape.
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:30.901]  Showing giant crates of diamonds.
[01:46:31.301 --> 01:46:32.582]  It's all about monopoly.
[01:46:33.582 --> 01:46:41.366]  They'd rather sell you a gallon of oil for ten times what it's worth than just sell you the oil.
[01:46:41.386 --> 01:46:41.886]  You understand?
[01:46:41.966 --> 01:46:43.206]  It's about monopoly.
[01:46:43.787 --> 01:46:45.027]  I think I understand it.
[01:46:45.087 --> 01:46:45.667]  I really do.
[01:46:45.727 --> 01:46:47.168]  I didn't call in to argue with you.
[01:46:47.228 --> 01:46:48.809]  I was trying to get that straight.
[01:46:49.049 --> 01:46:50.289]  I'm just talking to all the listeners.
[01:46:50.489 --> 01:46:51.110]  Yeah, great.
[01:46:51.230 --> 01:46:52.070]  I appreciate that.
[01:46:52.575 --> 01:47:00.302]  I have talked to people before and I say, find people my age, I'm 57, and I say, do you remember when they put in the Alaskan Pipeline?
[01:47:00.402 --> 01:47:00.822]  Oh yeah.
[01:47:01.103 --> 01:47:02.063]  Do you remember why?
[01:47:02.504 --> 01:47:09.430]  Well, most of them don't remember, but some of them will go, yeah, because that was whenever all those tankers were going aground about one every week.
[01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:11.632]  Well, we haven't had that happen in a long time, thank God.
[01:47:12.453 --> 01:47:16.236]  And then I say, well, what's happened to all that oil?
[01:47:16.516 --> 01:47:18.478]  And they go, well, I don't know, you never hear about it.
[01:47:19.045 --> 01:47:25.971]  And I said, well, I've heard at least twice, but I didn't have it confirmed like you're doing, that all of that oil was basically sold to Japan.
[01:47:26.451 --> 01:47:29.333]  By the way, let me tell you, oil tankers still go aground.
[01:47:29.714 --> 01:47:33.857]  They just put it in the back of the newspaper now because they don't want you to really know about it.
[01:47:34.858 --> 01:47:35.418]  God, Alex.
[01:47:35.799 --> 01:47:36.780]  Hey, I appreciate the call, man.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.440]  That burns me.
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:37.800]  Thanks.
[01:47:38.081 --> 01:47:38.901]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[01:47:39.442 --> 01:47:41.884]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bryant in Texas.
[01:47:41.924 --> 01:47:42.704]  Bryant, go ahead.
[01:47:43.085 --> 01:47:43.625]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:44.546 --> 01:47:46.888]  Yeah, I listen to you on the internet, Alex.
[01:47:48.288 --> 01:47:48.848]  Can you hear me?
[01:47:48.989 --> 01:47:49.549]  Yes I can!
[01:47:50.069 --> 01:48:00.537]  Okay listen Alex, I have this organization on the internet called the Aspartame Victim Support Group and we have 792 members right now.
[01:48:00.597 --> 01:48:07.042]  We're an email list and we're part of a loose coalition of activists who try to
[01:48:08.038 --> 01:48:13.783]  Spread the word about Aspartame dangers and I know you've had Betty Martini on your show before.
[01:48:13.803 --> 01:48:16.645]  Yeah, I haven't done a show on Aspartame in probably a year.
[01:48:16.705 --> 01:48:18.307]  I've probably done 50 shows on it.
[01:48:18.367 --> 01:48:22.631]  I mean, everybody I talk to knows it's poison but they still slurp it and laugh at you.
[01:48:23.011 --> 01:48:28.956]  Well, the reason why I wanted to bring this up because it's kind of timely right now because there's so much being said about
[01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:34.204]  Donald Rumsfeld, and as you probably know, he's the person most responsible.
[01:48:34.304 --> 01:48:39.448]  He's the guy from Santo that got it approved, that bought it from the German company Searle.
[01:48:39.488 --> 01:48:42.130]  It was used in concentration camps as a sedative.
[01:48:42.490 --> 01:48:47.694]  It is a fluoride molecule, and it is admittedly listed as a chemical weapon.
[01:48:48.795 --> 01:48:51.457]  Yeah, well... It's now in 9,000 foods.
[01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:58.123]  And the reason why this came to mind is because the gentleman called in and mentioned Motrin and how it had
[01:49:00.226 --> 01:49:00.766]  What was it?
[01:49:01.687 --> 01:49:04.209]  Another sedative in it.
[01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:10.773]  But the thing I would like to mention is that almost all children's health products contain aspartame.
[01:49:11.394 --> 01:49:24.223]  And, you know, I would say about 10 years ago they were able to get it out of baby food in California because one of the ingredients, which they call aspartate, which is aspartic acid,
[01:49:24.970 --> 01:49:38.418]  Uh, was, uh, was shown through, uh, empirical studies to, uh, lead to autism in children, and when they stop taking it out of there, the instances of autism... But notice, notice what the unified theme is.
[01:49:38.558 --> 01:49:40.339]  The fluoride in the water dumbs you down.
[01:49:40.639 --> 01:49:42.000]  The aspartame dumbs you down.
[01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:44.061]  It's all about dumbing you down.
[01:49:45.518 --> 01:49:48.300]  Right, but it's just criminal what they're doing to children.
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:56.605]  Well, sir, the CDC's own documents say millions have been brain damaged by the, by the, by the, uh, the Marisol Mercury, so they just continue doing it.
[01:49:56.645 --> 01:49:57.506]  It's admitted fact.
[01:49:58.246 --> 01:50:03.009]  We've gone from 1 in 25,000 having autism to now 1 out of just a couple hundred.
[01:50:03.529 --> 01:50:05.991]  I mean, this is being done by design.
[01:50:06.932 --> 01:50:12.235]  Well, uh, Alex, I'd just like to ask your help in, uh, in, uh, helping us, uh, uh,
[01:50:12.659 --> 01:50:16.641]  You know, direct people at us so that we can help them because we're a support group.
[01:50:17.062 --> 01:50:22.145]  We're in Aspartame victims who suffered from... Yeah, sure, so... I'm one of them.
[01:50:22.205 --> 01:50:24.386]  So you want to plug your thing, go ahead and plug it.
[01:50:24.646 --> 01:50:27.288]  Yeah, well I'd like to get you to update your links.
[01:50:27.328 --> 01:50:28.569]  Can I talk to your webmaster?
[01:50:28.649 --> 01:50:32.231]  Well, you're almost... Now sir, I can let you plug it, but I can't do work for you right now here on air.
[01:50:32.811 --> 01:50:33.092]  Right.
[01:50:33.112 --> 01:50:34.534]  You want to plug it, you better plug it.
[01:50:34.654 --> 01:50:41.162]  Yeah, okay, well just do a search for the Aspartame Victim Support Group on Google and you'll find us right away.
[01:50:41.342 --> 01:50:49.413]  No, I want to put a bigger toxic vaccine, toxic food additive section on the websites and we're working as hard as we can, sir, and we're glad you're out there working too.
[01:50:49.473 --> 01:50:50.114]  Thank you very much.
[01:50:50.414 --> 01:50:50.995]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:53.934 --> 01:51:00.778]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:51:01.078 --> 01:51:02.459]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:51:02.639 --> 01:51:04.860]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.101]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:51:07.381 --> 01:51:12.304]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:51:12.644 --> 01:51:16.666]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:51:16.926 --> 01:51:18.707]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:51:18.787 --> 01:51:29.431]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:51:29.571 --> 01:51:31.491]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:51:31.691 --> 01:51:35.553]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.
[01:51:35.633 --> 01:51:36.853]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[01:51:37.073 --> 01:51:37.274]  That's 888-2533139.

[01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:55.110]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:51:55.190 --> 01:52:05.915]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:52:06.295 --> 01:52:10.817]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:52:10.877 --> 01:52:22.223]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[01:52:22.803 --> 01:52:29.646]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:52:30.046 --> 01:52:32.187]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:52:32.668 --> 01:52:37.630]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:52:37.950 --> 01:52:44.260]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:48.527]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:52:48.747 --> 01:52:49.508]  That's toll free.
[01:52:49.528 --> 01:52:49.568]  888-803-4438.
[01:52:54.853 --> 01:52:55.194]  I think so.
[01:53:10.097 --> 01:53:10.758]  We're good to go!
[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:42.722]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:53:42.882 --> 01:53:48.747]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[01:54:02.148 --> 01:54:13.658]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live, over to the final segment.
[01:54:32.407 --> 01:54:34.829]  Of this second hour, third hour coming up.
[01:54:36.071 --> 01:54:38.072]  And yeah, there's a lot we want to do with the websites.
[01:54:38.853 --> 01:54:45.619]  We need to create, we've got subsections and links to the groups that expose aspartame and the vaccines and the rest of it.
[01:54:45.659 --> 01:54:49.743]  We have those guests up here, but that's all on the internet for you on other websites too.
[01:54:50.824 --> 01:54:53.166]  But don't worry, we'll work harder and get more done.
[01:54:54.668 --> 01:54:54.968]  It's just,
[01:54:55.583 --> 01:55:00.204]  We have a small staff and that's why your support is so vital to this broadcast.
[01:55:00.324 --> 01:55:07.246]  I would hire more people, more webmasters, do a better job if we get your support.
[01:55:07.286 --> 01:55:07.966]  But it's real simple.
[01:55:08.006 --> 01:55:10.226]  We can grow as fast as you allow us.
[01:55:11.187 --> 01:55:12.607]  And right now we need your support.
[01:55:12.647 --> 01:55:13.607]  But that's secondary.
[01:55:14.407 --> 01:55:16.708]  I have made ten incredibly powerful
[01:55:18.303 --> 01:55:45.215]  mind-altering, you know, wake-up calls, ten films, I've written a book, I've published a book, we carry a bunch of other videos and DVDs and books on tape and pro-gun t-shirts and anti-tyranny t-shirts and InfoWars.com bumper stickers and you can purchase it all by going to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or simply by calling toll-free

[01:55:46.689 --> 01:55:53.333]  These are amazing videos.
[01:55:53.373 --> 01:56:07.724]  My films on 9-11, my films on the occult activities at the Global Elite, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, the new Jews the Preservation of Firearms ownership video, Innocence Betrayed, gotta get that, comes with free booklets.

[01:56:43.402 --> 01:56:47.085]  My videos are all over two hours long, $25.95 apiece.
[01:56:47.485 --> 01:56:49.946]  When you order three or more, they drop down to $20.
[01:56:50.767 --> 01:56:53.048]  My book, Descent into Tyranny, about $9.11, is only $12.
[01:56:53.489 --> 01:56:56.531]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[01:56:56.591 --> 01:56:57.291]  Back to the calls.
[01:56:57.331 --> 01:56:58.392]  We'll come back in the next hour.
[01:56:58.432 --> 01:56:59.373]  More news, more calls.
[01:56:59.673 --> 01:57:01.654]  Haven't even scratched the surface here on some of the news.
[01:57:02.515 --> 01:57:05.877]  Let's go ahead and go to Elizabeth in Texas.
[01:57:06.257 --> 01:57:07.218]  Elizabeth, go ahead.
[01:57:07.816 --> 01:57:08.997]  Yes, Alex, thank you.
[01:57:09.537 --> 01:57:12.039]  We've been listening to you since 1998.
[01:57:12.099 --> 01:57:17.402]  We live out in the hill country now and can only get you by satellite, so we can't see you anymore, but we can hear you every day.
[01:57:18.143 --> 01:57:29.670]  I want to thank you for what you've done and encourage all your listeners to get those videotapes, because if they take notes and they research your data, they will see that you are exactly correct about everything you claim.
[01:57:30.590 --> 01:57:33.532]  And you are so much younger than most of us who listen to you.
[01:57:33.592 --> 01:57:36.134]  You've done an amazing amount of work in your lifetime.
[01:57:37.202 --> 01:57:47.594]  The second thing I want to say is, and read before I forget it, to the caller from Missouri who wanted to see data on the oil on the Prudhoe Bay, North Shore area of Alaska.
[01:57:48.275 --> 01:57:52.920]  Reverend Lindsey Williams' book, The Energy Non-Crisis, is available free online.
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:54.442]  You can download the whole book.
[01:57:55.171 --> 01:57:56.132]  That is the beginning.
[01:57:56.152 --> 01:58:00.394]  And he was the chaplain for the big oil companies.
[01:58:00.694 --> 01:58:05.817]  He was in the meetings where they talked about how the American people don't get this oil.
[01:58:06.097 --> 01:58:09.118]  Well, he is dying of leukemia now, and he's made this book.
[01:58:09.598 --> 01:58:15.301]  He's giving away his product for the sake of people hearing the truth, the same as you.
[01:58:15.361 --> 01:58:17.543]  He's dying of leukemia?
[01:58:17.583 --> 01:58:18.263]  I didn't know that.
[01:58:18.423 --> 01:58:19.384]  He has leukemia.
[01:58:19.464 --> 01:58:23.986]  He's been a minister now for 30 years since he left Arco as their executive chaplain.
[01:58:24.782 --> 01:58:30.826]  And again, his name is Lindsey Williams, and it's available for free to anyone who has internet access.
[01:58:30.907 --> 01:58:32.448]  And I have one more thing I'd like to ask.
[01:58:33.008 --> 01:58:33.889]  Okay, stay there.
[01:58:33.969 --> 01:58:41.254]  Third hour, straight ahead, more news on the torture, what's happening with the oil prices, the police state, it's all coming up.
[01:58:44.784 --> 01:58:48.266]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:58:48.526 --> 01:58:52.027]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:58:52.127 --> 01:58:56.069]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:58:56.289 --> 01:59:02.452]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:02.852 --> 01:59:10.756]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:59:11.176 --> 01:59:16.520]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:20.463]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:59:20.823 --> 01:59:22.685]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[01:59:22.745 --> 01:59:24.907]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:59:25.147 --> 01:59:29.750]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:35.675]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:59:39.057 --> 01:59:42.898]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:59:50.159 --> 01:59:50.819]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.459 --> 01:59:52.520]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:54.380]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:55.840]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:57.581]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.141 --> 02:00:01.801]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.301 --> 02:00:04.662]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:05.550 --> 02:00:06.430]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.873 --> 02:00:22.935]  Already into hour number three on this thirteenth day of May 2004.
[02:00:24.355 --> 02:00:25.155]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.215 --> 02:00:26.156]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:27.176 --> 02:00:30.917]  We've been talking about oil prices in some areas of the country going above three dollars.
[02:00:33.587 --> 02:00:35.748]  Two dollars now the national average.
[02:00:37.609 --> 02:00:38.570]  And no end in sight.
[02:00:38.610 --> 02:00:48.975]  They say it could hit four dollars a gallon on the west coast by the peak summer months and be upwards of three dollars across the rest of the country.
[02:00:49.815 --> 02:00:51.416]  Meanwhile, we're swimming in oil.
[02:00:51.556 --> 02:00:52.456]  More oil than ever.
[02:00:52.897 --> 02:00:54.918]  The oil companies are making record profits.
[02:00:55.738 --> 02:00:57.459]  It is a complete and total scam.
[02:00:58.906 --> 02:01:16.081]  But going back to our caller, who I wanted to give a little bit more time, going back to Elizabeth in Texas, she was talking about Lindsey Williams, the pastor who worked at the big oil companies and heard all these discussions and what he put in his book, and she said he was dying of leukemia now and had put his book out for free on the website.
[02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:16.962]  Go ahead.
[02:01:17.899 --> 02:01:22.782]  They can find that by... I wish I could remember the connection to the link.
[02:01:23.282 --> 02:01:26.323]  Well, you can find anything you want via search engine.
[02:01:26.363 --> 02:01:34.728]  His name and the Energy Non-Crisis will take you to at least five links and one of them will take you directly into the book which is downloadable for free.
[02:01:34.748 --> 02:01:36.229]  It's in HTML format.
[02:01:36.429 --> 02:01:37.929]  Okay, that's great.
[02:01:37.989 --> 02:01:38.950]  What else is on your mind?
[02:01:39.330 --> 02:01:40.991]  Oh, you were talking about something.
[02:01:41.071 --> 02:01:45.293]  I've listened to you again for six years now, and you were talking about something.
[02:01:45.313 --> 02:01:47.875]  This is so tangentially related, but it is relative.
[02:01:48.595 --> 02:01:51.117]  The William Peter Blatty issue.
[02:01:51.557 --> 02:01:57.640]  He did The Exorcist, yes, but he also released a little-known movie that just bombed at the box office.
[02:01:58.241 --> 02:02:05.685]  On the heels of that, I waited for this movie to come out because I was home from school and I saw a Mike Douglas show and I saw him
[02:02:06.562 --> 02:02:08.183]  I'm touting this release.
[02:02:08.323 --> 02:02:28.179]  It was to be called Twinkle Twinkle Killer Cane, but it got renamed the Ninth Configuration, and it's about this psychiatrist who shows up at an installation where military officers who've suffered battle fatigue or insanity as a result of war have been taken and is supposed to be somewhere in Washington State.
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:34.564]  And he appears on the scene to help them regain their memories, to help them recover from insanity,
[02:02:35.206 --> 02:02:45.096]  Only to have the story twist and turn and the viewer then doesn't know whether they're watching another inmate pretending to be a psychiatrist or the devil pretending to be
[02:02:45.802 --> 02:02:49.963]  Christ, it is a psychodrama that just didn't do well at the box office.
[02:02:50.043 --> 02:02:56.705]  And again, for those that don't know, a CIA mind control expert wrote The Exorcist, put subliminals in it.
[02:02:56.725 --> 02:02:58.365]  You're talking about another film he made.
[02:02:58.685 --> 02:03:04.946]  Yes, I bought it for a dollar at Albertson's about five years ago and brought it home and watched it.
[02:03:04.966 --> 02:03:05.767]  It's on videotape.
[02:03:05.807 --> 02:03:07.067]  I have it in my hand right here.
[02:03:07.107 --> 02:03:11.288]  Stacey Keech is the central character, the doctor that you can't tell if he's good or evil.
[02:03:11.826 --> 02:03:19.571]  And I thought this was a real revelation from Blatty as far as the SCIOP operation itself.
[02:03:19.791 --> 02:03:21.172]  I mean, I just wanted to share that.
[02:03:21.192 --> 02:03:22.153]  That's just a FYI thing.
[02:03:22.173 --> 02:03:23.253]  Well, that's what they're into.
[02:03:23.273 --> 02:03:23.894]  Thanks for the call.
[02:03:23.934 --> 02:03:24.774]  Good to hear from you.
[02:03:25.495 --> 02:03:27.076]  Let's talk to Jim in Florida.
[02:03:27.116 --> 02:03:27.976]  Jim, go ahead.
[02:03:31.098 --> 02:03:36.942]  Observations about the Nick Berg video, but you had that gentleman talking about the Alaskan pipeline.
[02:03:38.528 --> 02:03:39.469]  I'm ex-Oil Patch.
[02:03:39.509 --> 02:03:44.831]  I was in the Oil Patch for 30 plus years, all the way from the South Coastal Plains of Texas on up north to Canada.
[02:03:46.572 --> 02:03:50.754]  I've been trying to tell people about this game for years, and they laugh at me.
[02:03:52.214 --> 02:04:04.920]  If people would just realize the number of wells that I myself personally plugged back because I was told it was not feasibly economical to produce at the time, they would die.
[02:04:05.586 --> 02:04:14.638]  I mean I have plugged back wells with these United States that you just would not believe that could commercially be produced.
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:21.788]  Well I'll tell you what, stay there and when we get back we'll talk more about it with you sir.
[02:04:24.179 --> 02:04:28.142]  Again, OPEC powerless to stem oil price surge.
[02:04:28.463 --> 02:04:29.844]  They're telling us there's no oil.
[02:04:30.184 --> 02:04:38.130]  Now the problem is they found so much oil that it threatens to drive down the price so they're just expanding the monopoly to totally scam you people.
[02:04:38.831 --> 02:04:44.015]  And we've got to cause an awakening to this or we're going to be paying four bucks a gallon like they do in Europe.
[02:04:45.911 --> 02:04:54.337]  Folks, the future of gardening is upon us, and whether you grow for fun, food, or profit, you'll discover great new ways to reap more rewards from everything you grow at futuregarden.com.

[02:05:49.947 --> 02:05:51.247]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:05:51.447 --> 02:05:57.189]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:05:57.469 --> 02:06:02.710]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:06:03.010 --> 02:06:07.151]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:06:07.331 --> 02:06:11.111]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:06:11.371 --> 02:06:15.992]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:06:16.092 --> 02:06:18.833]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:06:19.173 --> 02:06:22.336]  Psychotic UN Population Control Plans and much, much more.
[02:06:22.396 --> 02:06:24.257]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:06:24.717 --> 02:06:26.799]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.

[02:06:42.451 --> 02:06:44.533]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:06:45.566 --> 02:06:47.187]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:47.327 --> 02:06:51.449]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:06:51.569 --> 02:06:54.451]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:06:54.531 --> 02:07:01.214]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:07:01.414 --> 02:07:04.419]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:07:04.639 --> 02:07:07.023]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:07:07.163 --> 02:07:17.318]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:07:17.498 --> 02:07:26.622]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:07:26.782 --> 02:07:34.545]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:07:34.565 --> 02:07:35.005]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:07:35.065 --> 02:07:36.766]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:07:46.465 --> 02:07:52.088]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:54.569 --> 02:07:57.050]  Alright my friends, I'm here in Texas.
[02:07:59.691 --> 02:08:03.773]  I have family on both sides who've worked in the oil industry at many different levels of it.
[02:08:06.034 --> 02:08:13.998]  There are thousands and thousands and thousands of plugged wells that are just full of oil with pipelines that send the oil to tanks right there.
[02:08:15.276 --> 02:08:33.879]  The oil companies run this big scam, to where only a few conglomerates can control the entire market, to where they maximize their profits, and they are making record profits, and it's not because of the free market, it's because of an oligopoly, or a group of corporations combining forces to create an overall monopoly effect.
[02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:38.340]  They try to blame the Arabs for this, and certainly they're scamming us too.
[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:42.041]  They're going along with it, and
[02:08:43.157 --> 02:08:51.144]  Look, we have enough oil to run this country for decades and decades and decades and decades and decades and decades in one field alone in Alaska.
[02:08:52.264 --> 02:09:01.012]  And those pipelines go to the oil tankers that go to Japan and China and the eastern side of Russia.
[02:09:01.792 --> 02:09:03.093]  We don't get that oil.
[02:09:04.735 --> 02:09:06.216]  But they do.
[02:09:07.344 --> 02:09:12.907]  And then they have the phony left-wing group out there saying there's no oil left, oh there's no oil left, it's peak oil, it's peak oil.
[02:09:13.227 --> 02:09:18.050]  The oil companies are actually out there financing these think tanks and these scientific firms to say all of this.
[02:09:19.066 --> 02:09:28.454]  We were talking to a caller in Florida, Jim, and he was talking about how he's worked in oil fields all over the Americas, and was backing up what we're saying.
[02:09:29.575 --> 02:09:32.877]  Give the listeners some more details of how this game is played.
[02:09:32.897 --> 02:09:39.062]  I mean, we've had former oil company workers and executives on the show in the past, but explain it to people, Jim.
[02:09:39.302 --> 02:09:41.724]  Well, this is really going to upset some people, Alex.
[02:09:41.804 --> 02:09:47.909]  I mean, a good example in eastern Kansas, they have what they call a Mississippian formation through there.
[02:09:48.776 --> 02:09:51.357]  Uh, the drilling's only 800 to 1200 feet deep.
[02:09:52.218 --> 02:09:57.360]  And these wells produce anywhere from 100 to 600 barrels a day of good, green, live oil.
[02:09:57.820 --> 02:10:00.481]  Now, being an old oil patch family, you know what green oil is.
[02:10:00.921 --> 02:10:02.562]  That's some of the best oil there is.
[02:10:02.982 --> 02:10:04.003]  Sweet, low sulfur.
[02:10:04.803 --> 02:10:07.965]  Uh, Kansas, a lot of people think of Kansas as just wheat fields.
[02:10:08.385 --> 02:10:11.046]  But there is natural gas, like in the Huguenin Fields.
[02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:14.106]  Uh, around, uh, uh, Eugene, Kansas.
[02:10:14.126 --> 02:10:15.367]  Uh, Great Bend, Kansas.
[02:10:15.407 --> 02:10:16.788]  Full of, uh, oil and gas.
[02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:18.950]  You can drill a well almost anywhere.
[02:10:19.130 --> 02:10:21.272]  You can drill a well almost anywhere in East Texas.
[02:10:21.432 --> 02:10:21.873]  That's right.
[02:10:22.113 --> 02:10:24.094]  And, uh, it'll just come shooting out of the ground.
[02:10:24.235 --> 02:10:24.715]  That's right.
[02:10:24.735 --> 02:10:29.979]  I mean, if Grandpa Clampett shoots the ground with a shotgun, up from the ground comes a bubble and crude.
[02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:31.701]  That's just about right.
[02:10:31.741 --> 02:10:33.863]  That's the way it was in East Texas on the turn of the century.
[02:10:34.263 --> 02:10:38.947]  Now, granted, we've depleted some of the, uh, uh, uh, pressures where we had to artificially lift.
[02:10:39.739 --> 02:10:43.000]  There is still barrel on top of barrel on top of barrel in these texts.
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:50.881]  If listeners really want to get into this, there's a book by a gentleman by the name of David Yergin.
[02:10:51.761 --> 02:10:52.882]  It's called The Prize.
[02:10:53.762 --> 02:10:54.982]  It's a real lengthy book.
[02:10:55.002 --> 02:10:56.102]  It's about 800 pages.
[02:10:56.422 --> 02:10:58.763]  Now, being in the oil industry, I mean, this isn't a secret.
[02:10:58.783 --> 02:10:59.963]  Everybody talks about this.
[02:11:01.643 --> 02:11:03.003]  Yeah, everybody talks about it.
[02:11:03.063 --> 02:11:05.844]  I'm out of the oil patch now because I'm so disgusted with the oil patch.
[02:11:06.653 --> 02:11:09.576]  First time in 30 years I had a lost time accident.
[02:11:09.777 --> 02:11:11.258]  This is how deep the tentacles go.
[02:11:11.779 --> 02:11:16.264]  All the way down to the personal level of the men that work on these drilling rigs for example.
[02:11:16.965 --> 02:11:20.508]  I was hurt on a drilling rig and it was a legitimate injury.
[02:11:21.149 --> 02:11:23.652]  With 7 witnesses I still lose a workers comp case.
[02:11:26.602 --> 02:11:33.044]  It's incredible, but to look at all the oil in Alaska, and to see this scam unfolding, and I guess the people are just going to be ignorant.
[02:11:33.184 --> 02:11:46.547]  They know all about Friends, the TV show, they know all about the Super Bowl, but they don't know about their Constitution, their Bill of Rights, they don't know about oil, they don't even know how many continents there are, or what their state capital is.
[02:11:46.587 --> 02:11:47.728]  Don't sort me on the sheeple.
[02:11:48.248 --> 02:11:50.128]  I don't know what has happened to our society.
[02:11:52.785 --> 02:12:03.849]  Very calmly and bring up very legitimate points about the gas, the money, the powers that be, the banks, and they just look at you and roll their eyes up in their heads anymore.
[02:12:03.929 --> 02:12:05.670]  Yeah, they might have to face some corruption.
[02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:06.850]  They might have to get involved.
[02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:09.431]  So I guess they'll just pay three, four bucks a gallon for gas.
[02:12:09.611 --> 02:12:09.891]  Right.
[02:12:10.011 --> 02:12:11.492]  I guess they can roll their eyes at that.
[02:12:11.792 --> 02:12:12.332]  I guess so.
[02:12:12.712 --> 02:12:16.414]  If I may, can I make a couple of points that I've noticed on the video of Mr. Berg?
[02:12:16.814 --> 02:12:17.074]  Sure.
[02:12:18.335 --> 02:12:19.735]  I'm also ex-military.
[02:12:20.015 --> 02:12:22.056]  I served my two years during the Vietnam era.
[02:12:22.771 --> 02:12:32.334]  And one thing I've noticed, I haven't noticed very many Middle Eastern terrorists that blouse their military type boots in the United States military fashion.
[02:12:33.815 --> 02:12:38.256]  I noticed on that video that a couple of those guys on the left
[02:12:38.726 --> 02:12:41.807]  Have their boots bloused, just as if they were in the United States military.
[02:12:42.007 --> 02:12:44.967]  And they're standing there in rock-hard-ready fashion.
[02:12:45.087 --> 02:12:45.727]  Exactly.
[02:12:46.287 --> 02:12:52.708]  And, uh, it's the same blurry style video that we saw with the Fat Bin Laden tape, which they admit is fake.
[02:12:52.808 --> 02:12:53.609]  Won't tell us who did it.
[02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:54.129]  Right.
[02:12:54.409 --> 02:12:58.289]  And, uh, again, cut somebody's head off while they're alive.
[02:12:58.349 --> 02:13:00.110]  Blood shoots four, five, ten feet.
[02:13:00.750 --> 02:13:01.650]  They hold the head up.
[02:13:01.710 --> 02:13:02.850]  No blood drips out of it.
[02:13:03.930 --> 02:13:05.270]  And on top of it, he's in U.S.
[02:13:05.311 --> 02:13:06.191]  military custody.
[02:13:06.231 --> 02:13:06.911]  That's admitted.
[02:13:07.371 --> 02:13:08.051]  Then they, uh,
[02:13:09.036 --> 02:13:11.117]  Turn him over and he gets grabbed by Al-Qaeda.
[02:13:11.658 --> 02:13:14.660]  Very, very... And the FBI was there, interviewed him three times.
[02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:19.523]  They admit they had him, and now they're trying to say they didn't, when there was a lawsuit filed over this.
[02:13:19.923 --> 02:13:21.604]  So now we've caught him in a big lie.
[02:13:21.864 --> 02:13:23.706]  I wonder, I mean, what do you think about this?
[02:13:23.746 --> 02:13:24.786]  What's your gut level?
[02:13:24.967 --> 02:13:27.708]  I think we just caught him in another big wag the dog, Alex.
[02:13:27.768 --> 02:13:29.469]  I mean, you mentioned the FBI.
[02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:34.573]  There's another shot in that gory video.
[02:13:34.833 --> 02:13:36.234]  The gentleman on the far right,
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:40.143]  Well, he's adjusting his weapon on his right shoulder.
[02:13:41.143 --> 02:13:55.895]  If you watch it real close, you know, with QuickTime or a player like that, you can go frame by frame, you will distinctly see the forestock and hand grip around the trigger mechanism of that weapon, which is an FBI use all the time as a Tech-9 machine gun.
[02:13:55.915 --> 02:14:01.500]  I don't know who mentioned in the past that someone was holding an AK-47.
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:03.582]  One of them might be, but the one on the right, that's a Tech-9.
[02:14:04.924 --> 02:14:06.627]  Alright, well I appreciate the call.
[02:14:06.847 --> 02:14:08.870]  Plus, the tennis shoes are laced in hip-hop fashion.
[02:14:10.853 --> 02:14:12.656]  Take care, I appreciate the call.
[02:14:12.696 --> 02:14:15.380]  Yeah, it's, it's, the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[02:14:16.341 --> 02:14:17.063]  It really does.
[02:14:18.587 --> 02:14:30.193]  Well, we're going to get into some more of the news, and I want to get into these violent video games and some of the programming that's going on there, but first we'll let Alex and Mark and Clyde and others make their comments.
[02:14:30.313 --> 02:14:34.275]  Before we do that, for a few minutes, she comes on a couple times a week with us.
[02:14:34.635 --> 02:14:45.140]  We're honored to have her, Debbie Morrow of New Millennium Concepts, and they've got videos designed by a former federal expert on chemical, biological, radiological, about how to prepare your house.
[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:53.062]  They've got videos about prudent places that you can go to and demographics and maps, a little CD that's totally jam-packed.
[02:14:53.082 --> 02:14:57.704]  They've got the best water filters out there, water purification systems.
[02:14:58.644 --> 02:15:00.184]  Debbie, good to have you on the broadcast.
[02:15:00.505 --> 02:15:01.385]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:15:01.485 --> 02:15:03.005]  Thank you for having me.
[02:15:04.366 --> 02:15:09.067]  It's been some interesting things y'all have been talking about on the show.
[02:15:09.267 --> 02:15:11.868]  You know, I talked to you earlier today and you said you were in a store.
[02:15:12.748 --> 02:15:13.889]  And tell folks what happened.
[02:15:14.369 --> 02:15:14.769]  I was.
[02:15:14.829 --> 02:15:18.751]  I was in a restaurant eating Chinese food with my husband and a friend of his.
[02:15:19.472 --> 02:15:21.853]  And there's a man sitting at this table next to us.
[02:15:22.714 --> 02:15:24.455]  And, you know, I'm not shy.
[02:15:24.475 --> 02:15:25.735]  So I started chatting with him.
[02:15:26.656 --> 02:15:27.916]  And we started talking about the radio.
[02:15:27.956 --> 02:15:29.837]  And he said, well, do you listen to the radio much?
[02:15:29.878 --> 02:15:30.958]  And I said, well, yeah, I do.
[02:15:31.018 --> 02:15:32.479]  I said, but not a whole lot.
[02:15:33.359 --> 02:15:37.001]  Because, you know, they don't really have stuff I like on the radio here.
[02:15:37.021 --> 02:15:38.802]  I listen to the Internet.
[02:15:39.103 --> 02:15:41.524]  And he said, really, he said, do you ever listen to Coast to Coast?
[02:15:42.441 --> 02:15:44.363]  And I said, well, you know, as a matter of fact, I do.
[02:15:44.383 --> 02:15:52.530]  I sit in and I actually do business with a few of the people who have recently been on Coast to Coast.
[02:15:53.411 --> 02:15:54.392]  And he said, really?
[02:15:54.452 --> 02:15:54.672]  Who?
[02:15:54.732 --> 02:15:59.216]  And I said, well, Alex Jones and a couple of other people that I name.
[02:15:59.356 --> 02:16:02.419]  And he said, are you Debbie from New Millennium?
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:15.636]  Yeah, I am, and he said, I've got a Berkey, and I've got the fluoride filters, and I mean, he was just awesome, you know, and my husband and his friend were just kind of like sitting there going,
[02:16:16.355 --> 02:16:17.956]  What is this guy doing?
[02:16:17.976 --> 02:16:18.997]  That was real funny.
[02:16:19.157 --> 02:16:19.917]  That's interesting.
[02:16:19.957 --> 02:16:22.038]  I mean that shows the reach that we have.
[02:16:22.879 --> 02:16:24.940]  You've got several different specials for people.
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:27.341]  Tell them about them and tell folks how to take action.
[02:16:27.661 --> 02:16:28.061]  I do.
[02:16:28.562 --> 02:16:34.165]  We have the Berkey Light with the lights and with that you get two free gifts.
[02:16:34.625 --> 02:16:39.948]  The free gifts are either the Berkey Sport Bottle or a bottle of Casamide.
[02:16:40.603 --> 02:16:48.765]  Or the new movie Sheltering in Place or the DVD, not DVD, the CD-ROM that goes in your computer called Prudent Places.
[02:16:49.965 --> 02:16:54.687]  And that special there is $259 plus shipping.
[02:16:55.007 --> 02:17:03.529]  And then of course if you want to add the fluoride reduction filters with it, which I highly recommend if you live in an area where they add fluoride to the water.
[02:17:04.365 --> 02:17:06.807]  It's an extra $49 for that package.
[02:17:06.927 --> 02:17:12.392]  And for $199 you get the Berkey Light, the best filtration system, purification system out there.
[02:17:12.412 --> 02:17:18.677]  And you get one of the free gifts, the CD or the DVD or VHS or a sport Berkey.
[02:17:19.817 --> 02:17:21.779]  Folks, the water is just full of garbage.
[02:17:21.839 --> 02:17:23.520]  It's time to stop procrastinating.
[02:17:24.001 --> 02:17:26.523]  It's time to take control of your life in a big way.
[02:17:26.963 --> 02:17:28.624]  This is a place that you can take control.
[02:17:28.945 --> 02:17:30.546]  Your body is 70% water.
[02:17:30.846 --> 02:17:32.608]  They are poisoning the water.
[02:17:32.708 --> 02:17:33.148]  It's in the news.
[02:17:33.388 --> 02:17:36.454]  Every day, stop letting them do it to you and your family.
[02:17:36.755 --> 02:17:38.418]  Here's the toll-free number to call Debbie.
[02:17:39.224 --> 02:17:44.828]  If you call and the phone's busy, call right back or leave your name and number and she'll call you right back.
[02:17:45.208 --> 02:17:49.251]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[02:17:49.391 --> 02:17:53.033]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[02:17:53.954 --> 02:18:01.399]  Or go to Berkeywater.com and just add in the comments that it's the Alex Jones Special and tell them what free gift you want.
[02:18:01.639 --> 02:18:02.700]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:03.380]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:04.541]  Y'all have a good day.
[02:18:04.741 --> 02:18:05.601]  You're doing a great job.
[02:18:05.662 --> 02:18:08.243]  Folks, give Debbie a call right now.
[02:18:08.263 --> 02:18:09.924]  888-803-4438.
[02:18:11.144 --> 02:18:13.065]  Let's go to Alex in Indiana.
[02:18:13.106 --> 02:18:14.346]  Thanks for holding, sir.
[02:18:15.567 --> 02:18:16.027]  Hi, Alex.
[02:18:16.107 --> 02:18:16.787]  Hello, Alex.
[02:18:17.508 --> 02:18:18.148]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:18:18.188 --> 02:18:18.909]  Good to talk to you.
[02:18:19.229 --> 02:18:19.489]  Good.
[02:18:19.989 --> 02:18:23.331]  I just had a local news story for you you might not have caught.
[02:18:24.251 --> 02:18:30.155]  A couple weeks ago, a tornado hit a small town south of Chicago, Utica, Illinois.
[02:18:30.775 --> 02:18:31.455]  I did see that.
[02:18:31.776 --> 02:18:31.976]  Right.
[02:18:32.036 --> 02:18:34.297]  Well, Governor Blagojevich
[02:18:35.151 --> 02:18:36.051]  Took a tour of the town.
[02:18:36.091 --> 02:18:37.632]  The next day, people were killed.
[02:18:38.272 --> 02:18:39.392]  Completely routine.
[02:18:40.193 --> 02:18:53.717]  But, what caught my attention, the following morning, on all the local Chicago news stations, it was announced that he was going to tour the town again with the Undersecretary of Homeland Security.
[02:18:53.737 --> 02:18:56.118]  Yeah, Homeland Security.
[02:18:56.178 --> 02:18:59.419]  I guess they're involved in the weather now, and it was just a telling sign.
[02:19:00.029 --> 02:19:02.370]  They're going to be involved in every aspect of life.
[02:19:02.551 --> 02:19:06.733]  Look, if you read the news every day like I do, it's Homeland Security to fight crime.
[02:19:07.013 --> 02:19:08.835]  Homeland Security to fight family abuse.
[02:19:08.855 --> 02:19:09.175]  Exactly.
[02:19:09.195 --> 02:19:11.496]  Homeland Security to help in disasters.
[02:19:11.596 --> 02:19:13.558]  It's going to be every aspect.
[02:19:13.898 --> 02:19:17.480]  Job hiring, driver's license, national ID cards.
[02:19:17.780 --> 02:19:18.741]  They're going to run it all.
[02:19:19.041 --> 02:19:19.601]  Exactly.
[02:19:19.621 --> 02:19:20.102]  You got it.
[02:19:20.362 --> 02:19:21.182]  So what were they announcing?
[02:19:21.362 --> 02:19:23.104]  Homeland Security was there to help as well.
[02:19:23.144 --> 02:19:23.344]  Right.
[02:19:23.364 --> 02:19:25.245]  They never mentioned his name or anything.
[02:19:25.285 --> 02:19:28.347]  They just announced this short statement completely routine.
[02:19:29.918 --> 02:19:30.759]  Very interesting.
[02:19:30.979 --> 02:19:31.880]  Anything else, Alex?
[02:19:32.741 --> 02:19:34.222]  Just one point about the gas.
[02:19:34.342 --> 02:19:39.346]  I'm a union crane operator currently working a maintenance job at the BP refinery in Whiting.
[02:19:39.366 --> 02:19:40.347]  Stay there.
[02:19:40.467 --> 02:19:42.229]  I'll let you finish up briefly on the other side.
[02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:43.710]  More calls, more news.
[02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:44.311]  Stay with us.
[02:19:46.019 --> 02:19:56.751]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:19:56.931 --> 02:20:04.519]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:20:04.739 --> 02:20:07.920]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:20:08.161 --> 02:20:13.923]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:20:14.203 --> 02:20:20.346]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:20:20.706 --> 02:20:24.588]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:20:24.648 --> 02:20:26.549]  The water level is always visible.
[02:20:26.729 --> 02:20:32.673]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:20:32.913 --> 02:20:36.855]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:20:48.115 --> 02:20:53.618]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:20:54.039 --> 02:20:58.261]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:20:58.501 --> 02:21:05.545]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:21:05.906 --> 02:21:12.029]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:21:12.169 --> 02:21:13.370]  There are no side effects.
[02:21:13.710 --> 02:21:16.672]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:21:16.812 --> 02:21:18.834]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:21:19.154 --> 02:21:26.379]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:21:40.569 --> 02:21:42.770]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:21:44.191 --> 02:21:44.812]  Call today.
[02:21:46.973 --> 02:21:48.754]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[02:21:49.254 --> 02:21:52.677]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:21:53.177 --> 02:21:53.857]  Let's update.
[02:21:54.378 --> 02:21:57.820]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:21:59.727 --> 02:22:02.168]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:22:02.868 --> 02:22:03.808]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:22:03.848 --> 02:22:06.149]  dollar was worth 17% more than the euro.
[02:22:06.689 --> 02:22:07.590]  Today, the U.S.
[02:22:07.610 --> 02:22:09.831]  dollar is worth 28% less than the euro.
[02:22:10.251 --> 02:22:11.751]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:22:12.351 --> 02:22:14.332]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[02:22:15.673 --> 02:22:21.054]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:22:21.535 --> 02:22:22.275]  Gold is moving.
[02:22:22.535 --> 02:22:23.695]  Equities are treading water.
[02:22:24.095 --> 02:22:26.776]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:22:27.297 --> 02:22:28.637]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:22:29.093 --> 02:22:30.814]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:22:31.234 --> 02:22:33.175]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:22:33.595 --> 02:22:37.456]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:22:37.877 --> 02:22:40.017]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[02:22:40.418 --> 02:22:40.958]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:41.078 --> 02:22:48.801]  Are debt concerns keeping you up at night?
[02:22:49.021 --> 02:22:50.962]  Do you feel like you work just to pay bills?
[02:22:51.262 --> 02:22:53.563]  Are you tired of those annoying calls from bill collectors?
[02:22:53.911 --> 02:22:57.000]  Money Cares can customize a plan that will fit your needs and goals.
[02:22:57.321 --> 02:23:02.395]  The folks at Money Cares know that one size does not fit all when it comes to resolving your finances.
[02:23:02.697 --> 02:23:04.418]  So they designed a plan that works for you.
[02:23:04.638 --> 02:23:11.140]  Money Cares has one goal, and that is to help you get out of debt in the quickest way possible, using a strategy that is right for you.
[02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:12.260]  Remember this number.

[02:23:12.780 --> 02:23:13.361]  That's 1-800-644-4615.
[02:23:13.381 --> 02:23:15.601]  Call today for a free, no obligation consultation.
[02:23:15.661 --> 02:23:18.322]  Money Cares works for you, not the creditors.
[02:23:26.445 --> 02:23:28.926]  They'll help you get out of debt and avoid bankruptcy.
[02:23:29.146 --> 02:23:31.007]  You don't need to own a home to get help.
[02:23:31.227 --> 02:23:32.588]  This is not a loan program.
[02:23:32.808 --> 02:23:36.550]  They guarantee to offer the smartest, quickest way of getting out of debt.
[02:23:36.830 --> 02:23:38.451]  So call today 1-800-644-4615 and get a fresh start.
[02:23:50.626 --> 02:23:52.528]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:53.008 --> 02:23:55.850]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:03.716 --> 02:24:07.719]  CBS News is set to do another report.
[02:24:07.739 --> 02:24:08.900]  They've already released two.
[02:24:10.321 --> 02:24:14.024]  And this latest one, we've got a video clip of it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:24:14.605 --> 02:24:17.166]  We've already had two prisoners die, but who cares?
[02:24:17.287 --> 02:24:19.008]  That's two less for me to worry about.
[02:24:21.380 --> 02:24:24.061]  Documenting what they're doing on their own video cameras.
[02:24:25.342 --> 02:24:27.122]  People being beaten to death at the camps.
[02:24:28.143 --> 02:24:33.745]  But see, that's good when we do it, but suddenly in your sick neocon mind, it's bad when they do it.
[02:24:33.805 --> 02:24:34.905]  No, it's bad, period.
[02:24:36.566 --> 02:24:37.326]  So incredible.
[02:24:38.980 --> 02:24:42.961]  Let us go ahead and go back to, and I'll get more to this in a second, some of the other news.
[02:24:42.981 --> 02:24:45.242]  Rumsfeld's visit over there and what's happening with that.
[02:24:45.822 --> 02:24:49.223]  But right now, going back to Alex, letting him finish up in Indiana.
[02:24:49.343 --> 02:24:50.624]  Alex, you were going to say something else?
[02:24:50.944 --> 02:24:51.444]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:51.464 --> 02:24:53.464]  Just a point about the gas prices.
[02:24:53.624 --> 02:24:58.266]  I'm currently working on a large maintenance job at the BP refinery up there.
[02:24:58.746 --> 02:25:00.547]  Second largest in the country, I believe.
[02:25:01.227 --> 02:25:02.987]  But the refinery was built 1900.
[02:25:03.027 --> 02:25:06.248]  Most of the units are 50 or 60 years old.
[02:25:06.828 --> 02:25:08.509]  They require constant maintenance.
[02:25:09.801 --> 02:25:11.763]  And they cannot run at full capacity.
[02:25:12.423 --> 02:25:17.188]  I just think it's a shame that we're not building modern refineries in this country.
[02:25:18.188 --> 02:25:21.612]  We're paying $2.10 per regular up here, next to the refinery.
[02:25:22.212 --> 02:25:23.733]  Well, that's all part of the scam.
[02:25:23.793 --> 02:25:28.918]  I mean, it's just to let the whole system fall apart, keep gouging and gouging and gouging.
[02:25:29.438 --> 02:25:29.919]  Exactly.
[02:25:30.019 --> 02:25:32.221]  All heavy industry will leave this country.
[02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:34.650]  Amazing.
[02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:38.931]  And they're building new systems all over the world, but not here in America.
[02:25:38.951 --> 02:25:39.552]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:39.572 --> 02:25:40.012]  Thanks.
[02:25:40.372 --> 02:25:42.232]  And the globalists have public documents.
[02:25:42.432 --> 02:25:44.973]  You've heard them on TV say, we've got to bring down our standard.
[02:25:44.993 --> 02:25:46.874]  We've got to pay our fair share.
[02:25:46.914 --> 02:25:47.954]  We've got it too good.
[02:25:48.034 --> 02:25:48.734]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:25:49.434 --> 02:25:52.835]  Because by getting rid of the middle class, that brings more control.
[02:25:53.335 --> 02:25:54.616]  Great points, Alex.
[02:25:55.456 --> 02:25:59.217]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in New York, then Beth
[02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:01.611]  Uh, Michelle and others.
[02:26:02.051 --> 02:26:03.713]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:26:04.853 --> 02:26:06.394]  Yes, hello Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:26:06.594 --> 02:26:06.895]  Fine.
[02:26:08.356 --> 02:26:13.519]  I was wondering, this might be out of context, but have you ever had Tim Tucker on this year at all?
[02:26:14.099 --> 02:26:15.040]  American Free Press?
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:19.143]  Yes, I've had Mr. Tucker on and I should have him back on about the Bilderberg Group.
[02:26:19.403 --> 02:26:20.804]  Yeah, it was getting to about that time of year.
[02:26:21.744 --> 02:26:22.605]  It certainly is.
[02:26:24.770 --> 02:26:25.830]  I don't even know where it is.
[02:26:25.850 --> 02:26:26.630]  I didn't keep up on that.
[02:26:26.850 --> 02:26:27.971]  Where is it this year anyway?
[02:26:28.251 --> 02:26:33.132]  You know, my memory normally doesn't fail me, but I have the article just a week ago of where it's going to be at.
[02:26:33.192 --> 02:26:36.092]  It's in Europe, and I can't remember exactly where.
[02:26:37.032 --> 02:26:37.332]  Right.
[02:26:37.352 --> 02:26:41.933]  Yeah, I kind of didn't follow up on it this year either, because I'm pretty much so used to it.
[02:26:42.113 --> 02:26:45.714]  I mean, every other year it's some other place, and you know what goes on.
[02:26:45.734 --> 02:26:47.294]  Are you on a cordless phone?
[02:26:48.414 --> 02:26:49.414]  No, it's actually a landline.
[02:26:49.534 --> 02:26:50.755]  Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[02:26:50.795 --> 02:26:51.495]  Go ahead and finish up.
[02:26:53.368 --> 02:26:57.932]  Actually, up here in New York State, we're in the Adirondacks, and it's $2.09 a gallon up here.
[02:26:58.633 --> 02:26:58.953]  Average.
[02:26:59.133 --> 02:26:59.734]  I mean, everywhere.
[02:27:00.995 --> 02:27:02.677]  With the gas prices, it's unbelievable.
[02:27:03.137 --> 02:27:07.041]  It's over $3 in many areas of California.
[02:27:07.621 --> 02:27:07.962]  Yeah, I know.
[02:27:08.002 --> 02:27:09.523]  I have a family over there, and we talked with them.
[02:27:09.543 --> 02:27:11.405]  They said it's like $2.60 with the high test.
[02:27:11.725 --> 02:27:13.687]  I mean, it's beyond belief.
[02:27:14.367 --> 02:27:17.030]  This is California numbers up here, where we were at already.
[02:27:18.050 --> 02:27:19.772]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:27:19.832 --> 02:27:20.592]  I appreciate that.
[02:27:20.673 --> 02:27:21.233]  Very interesting.
[02:27:21.874 --> 02:27:23.775]  Let us now go ahead and take another call.
[02:27:25.057 --> 02:27:27.999]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michelle in Pennsylvania.
[02:27:28.039 --> 02:27:28.880]  Michelle, go ahead.
[02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:30.141]  Hi Alex.
[02:27:30.522 --> 02:27:30.862]  Hello.
[02:27:30.882 --> 02:27:31.683]  How are you doing?
[02:27:32.063 --> 02:27:32.383]  Fine.
[02:27:32.764 --> 02:27:34.706]  I don't get your internet anymore.
[02:27:34.726 --> 02:27:37.868]  I don't know why you're not coming through.
[02:27:38.169 --> 02:27:40.831]  Well, your player's probably got a problem on your computer.
[02:27:41.272 --> 02:27:41.832]  Probably.
[02:27:43.101 --> 02:27:47.865]  Sisters, and she gave it to me and we tried to get you through a couple times and it wouldn't go through.
[02:27:47.885 --> 02:27:51.147]  It's Rochelle, your old friend from Pennsylvania.
[02:27:51.187 --> 02:27:52.948]  I've got to tell you what's going on here.
[02:27:52.968 --> 02:28:02.155]  In Pennsylvania here, they're bringing in a lot of people from the Dominican Republic and from Mexico.
[02:28:02.215 --> 02:28:03.496]  It's the same everywhere.
[02:28:03.556 --> 02:28:06.478]  The governors import more cheap labor.
[02:28:07.138 --> 02:28:07.759]  Isn't that awful?
[02:28:07.779 --> 02:28:09.220]  The economy isn't bad enough.
[02:28:10.365 --> 02:28:13.487]  Also, there was something interesting I found on my way home.
[02:28:14.627 --> 02:28:17.889]  They have a place where they can get all their documents now.
[02:28:18.609 --> 02:28:21.251]  And they just stamp it, and it's right there.
[02:28:21.291 --> 02:28:22.451]  They have their documents.
[02:28:22.571 --> 02:28:25.853]  They can get Latino Travel Center.
[02:28:26.113 --> 02:28:28.314]  They got the whole thing all sewed up there.
[02:28:28.854 --> 02:28:35.918]  And I just wanted to make a comment about what was going on on the news the other day when I came back from out at
[02:28:36.383 --> 02:28:48.267]  The area and I turned on the news and found this poor bird fella got beheaded like that and I guess that serves as a warning to all of us because they're going to come after us one way or another.
[02:28:48.707 --> 02:28:56.910]  Well going back to the matricula centers and thank you for the call ma'am back to the matricula centers they have
[02:28:58.739 --> 02:29:00.080]  800 plus cities doing it.
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:02.540]  There's dozens of countries that are issuing them.
[02:29:03.081 --> 02:29:04.841]  And the government just accepts them.
[02:29:04.861 --> 02:29:07.922]  The city of Austin will give anybody a fake birth certificate.
[02:29:08.362 --> 02:29:18.466]  They say, oh, this is just a record that you have these children, and you can use it as a document, but it says on small print that it's not really legally binding.
[02:29:19.686 --> 02:29:24.288]  And the government's telling you that everything you do in your life is going to be tracked and traced and controlled.
[02:29:26.841 --> 02:29:31.404]  But, we're gonna allow anybody from anywhere to come into this country with absolutely no check.
[02:29:31.684 --> 02:29:34.286]  But then when you leave the country, you're gonna get biometrically scanned.
[02:29:36.227 --> 02:29:37.087]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.608 --> 02:29:39.229]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.149 --> 02:29:42.811]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.281 --> 02:29:50.165]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:29:50.405 --> 02:29:55.850]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:29:56.130 --> 02:30:06.500]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:11.004]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:30:11.184 --> 02:30:19.528]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:30:19.808 --> 02:30:26.171]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:30:26.291 --> 02:30:30.753]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[02:31:45.529 --> 02:31:48.293]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[02:31:48.713 --> 02:31:49.795]  Are you running out of ideas?
[02:31:50.255 --> 02:31:50.876]  Out of time?
[02:31:51.357 --> 02:31:54.541]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[02:31:55.239 --> 02:31:58.061]  Well, think of a song, written especially for them.

[02:32:33.419 --> 02:32:34.119]  Anniversary?
[02:32:34.599 --> 02:32:35.319]  Wedding perhaps?
[02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:36.880]  Mother's Day's coming up?

[02:32:41.841 --> 02:32:44.162]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[02:32:56.758 --> 02:33:02.902]  Since the dawn of time, men have sought to dominate and control other men.
[02:33:05.344 --> 02:33:08.726]  Since the dawn of time.
[02:33:09.407 --> 02:33:11.168]  And they create pretexts.
[02:33:11.388 --> 02:33:14.490]  They create excuses to sell us slavery!
[02:33:15.171 --> 02:33:21.635]  And they've done it again with their phony drug wars that brings in the surveillance and the private prisons and all of it!
[02:33:23.317 --> 02:33:25.218]  Men have sought
[02:33:25.774 --> 02:33:29.095]  To dominate other men.
[02:33:29.536 --> 02:33:30.976]  That's called slavery.
[02:33:31.216 --> 02:33:35.718]  And now they've got all these other sophisticated brands of it, and I, for one, am sick of it!
[02:33:36.718 --> 02:33:41.400]  Tell you what, I'll take about five, six more calls, and I'm gonna cover news the last five, ten minutes of the broadcast.
[02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:43.681]  Got some other key news here we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:33:43.701 --> 02:33:45.702]  A recap of some other top stories.
[02:33:46.282 --> 02:33:47.983]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:48.003 --> 02:33:48.043]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:57.782 --> 02:34:00.983]  And we're going to go ahead and go back to your calls.
[02:34:01.504 --> 02:34:03.384]  Who should I go to first here, Stephanie?
[02:34:04.845 --> 02:34:06.225]  Clyde in Colorado.
[02:34:06.285 --> 02:34:07.126]  Clyde, you're on the air.
[02:34:07.166 --> 02:34:07.606]  Go ahead.
[02:34:08.566 --> 02:34:18.090]  Alex, I think one of the things we're going to see here in the not-too-distant future is probably an effort to raise the gas tax radically.
[02:34:18.910 --> 02:34:25.113]  And I think what they're probably going to use it for, and this will probably be at all levels, is to fund part of the police state activities.
[02:34:25.885 --> 02:34:30.550]  We're not going to need, uh, if you're not, if you're, if you're going to have gas prices at $3, $4 a barrel or gallon, say.
[02:34:32.970 --> 02:34:34.591]  Hey, you're not going to need as many roads.
[02:34:34.871 --> 02:34:36.712]  It's going to force people, and it already has.
[02:34:36.832 --> 02:34:37.813]  I can see this where I work.
[02:34:37.833 --> 02:34:41.455]  Well, that's why here in Austin, half the buses literally have no one on them.
[02:34:41.475 --> 02:34:42.616]  But they say, oh, don't worry.
[02:34:42.936 --> 02:34:44.017]  You're going to be needing them.
[02:34:44.057 --> 02:34:45.097]  You're going to be needing them.
[02:34:45.557 --> 02:34:48.139]  And they're changing the structure over to trains and buses.
[02:34:48.419 --> 02:34:50.280]  They're going to build hardened checkpoints in.
[02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:53.562]  What you have come up with, with common sense, is what they're doing.
[02:34:54.963 --> 02:35:01.507]  The states, and thanks for that Hawaii article yesterday, from Wisconsin to Hawaii, are going to
[02:35:02.293 --> 02:35:11.618]  The cell phones already track your every move, but now they're going to have a tax on the cell phone at the state level for the emergency centers to track you real time, to listen to what you're doing over the phone.
[02:35:11.938 --> 02:35:12.938]  This is all public.
[02:35:13.338 --> 02:35:14.959]  And it's the same thing with the gas tax.
[02:35:14.979 --> 02:35:22.243]  They're going to have a satellite tracker tax in your car that is shared with the county, city, state, the feds, the internationalists.
[02:35:22.803 --> 02:35:30.046]  And this is the control grid, the new national sales tax, all of it, you're absolutely right, it's going to be police state taxes.
[02:35:30.086 --> 02:35:30.466]  Go ahead.
[02:35:30.766 --> 02:35:41.709]  Well, I think that's just one of the methods that the police state, the globalists, can use to cut down on what we might call social mobility, or the ability of people to move around and to communicate.
[02:35:41.770 --> 02:35:51.953]  Because when people are in their cars, and I drive older cars a lot, it's hard, sometimes I communicate with other people, certain things, only in certain places and in certain circumstances.
[02:35:52.386 --> 02:35:55.587]  Well, I feel like that maybe I'm not going to be monitored as much.
[02:35:56.027 --> 02:36:11.791]  However, once you're in a situation where you can't do that, because that's being closed down, then you're going to be forced into using what we're using now, the phone, emails, even letters, and those are easily monitorable by whoever.
[02:36:12.232 --> 02:36:13.372]  Well, it's more than that.
[02:36:13.472 --> 02:36:14.792]  It's about the control.
[02:36:15.052 --> 02:36:15.813]  It's about control.
[02:36:16.193 --> 02:36:18.053]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:36:18.713 --> 02:36:20.614]  I think you're going to see proposals for
[02:36:21.147 --> 02:36:29.989]  Either the gas tax to get a huge sales tax, but use the money not for roads, because we're not going to need them, because we're not going to be moving around that much, I guess, in this new police state.
[02:36:30.009 --> 02:36:32.890]  I think you're going to see 50, 60, maybe even a dollar-a-gallon proposal.
[02:36:32.910 --> 02:36:34.110]  You mean this new Freedom?
[02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:39.832]  Yes, and use it for funding the police state, because I really think that's where we're headed.
[02:36:41.012 --> 02:36:49.334]  Because I think that, you know, it must bore a lot of these states to think that it's only 50 cents a gallon tax for 54 states.
[02:36:49.895 --> 02:36:50.276]  I think?
[02:36:58.976 --> 02:37:00.237]  Twenty years here in Colorado.
[02:37:00.477 --> 02:37:03.460]  And so they can train us to have higher fuel prices, period.
[02:37:03.500 --> 02:37:05.641]  They can jack up the tax and we won't notice.
[02:37:05.861 --> 02:37:15.269]  Or, they can jack it up to $2.50 national average, then let it fall back down to $1.75, then add another big $0.20 tax on it, and oh well, at least it isn't as bad as it was.
[02:37:15.549 --> 02:37:17.411]  This is all part of a training process.
[02:37:17.551 --> 02:37:21.434]  They'd like to have it be some kind of a sales tax, so that the revenues are great.
[02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:23.660]  I hear you.
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:24.541]  I appreciate the call.
[02:37:24.621 --> 02:37:25.241]  Great call.
[02:37:25.822 --> 02:37:27.243]  And they gave you who my calls are.
[02:37:27.283 --> 02:37:28.063]  They're up in Minnesota.
[02:37:28.083 --> 02:37:28.844]  I'm not here in Austin.
[02:37:28.864 --> 02:37:31.526]  I just lost them all, who my callers are.
[02:37:31.546 --> 02:37:32.206]  Who's up next?
[02:37:34.668 --> 02:37:35.488]  Jim in Michigan.
[02:37:35.528 --> 02:37:36.429]  Jim, you're on the air.
[02:37:36.569 --> 02:37:38.110]  God bless you, Alex Jones.
[02:37:38.731 --> 02:37:41.613]  The Emerson Review at Frederick, Michigan.
[02:37:42.555 --> 02:37:45.917]  A big story about George Hanson and how they tortured him in this country.
[02:37:46.057 --> 02:37:48.598]  He's the guy that wrote the book to harass our people.
[02:37:48.778 --> 02:37:51.159]  Yeah, that was the congressman.
[02:37:51.639 --> 02:37:51.840]  Yeah.
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:56.542]  And he exposed the Panama Canal handover to the Chi-Coms years before it happened.
[02:37:57.162 --> 02:38:03.145]  And so they came and grabbed him on quote taxes, drove him around the country, the diesel treatment.
[02:38:04.096 --> 02:38:04.276]  Yeah.
[02:38:04.436 --> 02:38:05.898]  They would beat him up every stop.
[02:38:06.038 --> 02:38:07.599]  Once a day they'd get him up for an hour.
[02:38:08.019 --> 02:38:10.381]  He would defecate on himself, urinate on himself.
[02:38:10.681 --> 02:38:13.003]  His feet busted, his toes busted off.
[02:38:13.023 --> 02:38:17.207]  Because when you sit there chained down for weeks and weeks on end, his feet burst.
[02:38:17.647 --> 02:38:19.509]  He started getting gangrene on his feet.
[02:38:19.949 --> 02:38:21.470]  And they would beat the congressman.
[02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:23.752]  If they could do this to a congressman, they could do it to anybody.
[02:38:24.132 --> 02:38:24.312]  Yeah.
[02:38:24.613 --> 02:38:31.478]  Hey, if you put what you know together with Father John O'Connor, what he knows, the Bayside Prophecies, and Father Krumer, you'd know the whole thing.
[02:38:31.738 --> 02:38:33.540]  And by the way, Robert Galen Ross is okay.
[02:38:34.719 --> 02:38:35.819]  Okay, that's wonderful.
[02:38:35.839 --> 02:38:39.561]  Yeah, I think you called a few weeks ago saying, where's Robert Galen Ross?
[02:38:39.661 --> 02:38:41.802]  And I said, he's down in Texas.
[02:38:41.822 --> 02:38:42.342]  He's fine.
[02:38:43.282 --> 02:38:45.023]  At least I know people who just saw him a few weeks ago.
[02:38:45.063 --> 02:38:46.523]  So you finally talked to him?
[02:38:46.724 --> 02:38:46.924]  Yeah.
[02:38:47.384 --> 02:38:47.784]  Yeah.
[02:38:47.924 --> 02:38:49.144]  And he's got a new address.
[02:38:49.204 --> 02:38:50.005]  That's what happened.
[02:38:50.045 --> 02:38:51.605]  And his numbers went dead for a while.
[02:38:51.665 --> 02:38:52.926]  So maybe that saved his butt.
[02:38:52.966 --> 02:38:53.326]  I don't know.
[02:38:53.766 --> 02:38:54.807]  I said a rosary for him.
[02:38:54.827 --> 02:38:55.187]  Saved his butt?
[02:38:55.247 --> 02:38:55.987]  And the guy's fine.
[02:38:56.567 --> 02:38:57.928]  He's always been fine.
[02:38:58.368 --> 02:38:59.989]  So why are you saying it maybe saved his butt?
[02:39:01.921 --> 02:39:06.902]  I know that prayer works and rosaries work real fine.
[02:39:07.662 --> 02:39:09.243]  Alright sir, I appreciate the call.
[02:39:09.303 --> 02:39:16.265]  Look, I get calls sometimes, oh we hear you died, or we hear you had a heart attack.
[02:39:16.525 --> 02:39:17.905]  Well no I didn't.
[02:39:18.365 --> 02:39:21.746]  Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated, as Mark Twain said.
[02:39:22.663 --> 02:39:31.306]  And, uh, you know, one time one of my friends got a divorce and moved, and then next, oh, he was murdered, and then the guy goes to public functions, and still, he's murdered!
[02:39:31.486 --> 02:39:32.066]  He's dead!
[02:39:32.246 --> 02:39:32.966]  He's not here!
[02:39:33.326 --> 02:39:38.288]  You know, uh, just please, folks, come on, stick with what you can prove!
[02:39:38.768 --> 02:39:41.369]  I'm alive, I'm here, so is everybody else.
[02:39:42.689 --> 02:39:51.552]  Um, and then you call and talk to him, he says, I changed my number, and you think, oh man, that saved your bacon, he wasn't in any problems, he was fine.
[02:39:53.024 --> 02:39:58.506]  But I mean, I don't blame people for being on the lookout for stuff like this, but there's enough stuff we can see right in their face that we can prove.
[02:39:58.606 --> 02:39:59.967]  Okay, who's up after Jim?
[02:40:00.907 --> 02:40:01.607]  Who in Ohio?
[02:40:02.448 --> 02:40:03.788]  Okay, who's after James?
[02:40:05.529 --> 02:40:07.370]  Okay, James in Ohio.
[02:40:07.410 --> 02:40:07.870]  Go ahead.
[02:40:07.890 --> 02:40:09.490]  Hey Alex, I wanted to tell you about it.
[02:40:09.510 --> 02:40:12.251]  We had a school lockdown here in Columbus, Ohio a couple days ago.
[02:40:13.956 --> 02:40:15.377]  Broken thermometer.
[02:40:15.397 --> 02:40:17.778]  They locked down the school right before it was about to let out.
[02:40:18.078 --> 02:40:18.838]  Parents all came there.
[02:40:18.859 --> 02:40:22.200]  It looked like the Columbine thing was going on there.
[02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:24.321]  Does the school already have a fence around it?
[02:40:24.681 --> 02:40:25.262]  No, it does not.
[02:40:25.742 --> 02:40:26.783]  Well, it'll have one now.
[02:40:26.903 --> 02:40:28.523]  And look, they do these drills everywhere.
[02:40:28.924 --> 02:40:30.644]  Before Columbine, before 9-11.
[02:40:30.965 --> 02:40:33.286]  I have Associated Press articles in the takeover.
[02:40:34.587 --> 02:40:39.391]  They would come in, round the kids up at gunpoint, put them on buses, take them to an emergency FEMA center.
[02:40:39.932 --> 02:40:44.916]  If a thermometer breaks, if there's a fist fight now, everybody gets frisked.
[02:40:45.096 --> 02:40:45.677]  Lockdown.
[02:40:45.977 --> 02:40:47.278]  Parents can't get your children.
[02:40:47.598 --> 02:40:51.182]  Washington Post admitted last year it's in police state three total enslavement.
[02:40:51.722 --> 02:40:52.503]  There's a red alert.
[02:40:52.523 --> 02:40:53.584]  They're going to take your children.
[02:40:53.624 --> 02:40:54.344]  You can't have them.
[02:40:54.685 --> 02:40:55.846]  You can't leave your house.
[02:40:56.146 --> 02:40:58.068]  It's all training us for martial law.
[02:40:58.368 --> 02:41:01.869]  I tried telling people with kids in schools this, and they just think I'm crazy.
[02:41:01.929 --> 02:41:04.970]  I said, you ever heard of the Emergency Health Powers Act and these kind of things?
[02:41:04.990 --> 02:41:07.832]  They can do just about anything they want now with legal legislation.
[02:41:07.852 --> 02:41:09.532]  I don't think it's legal, but it's law.
[02:41:09.852 --> 02:41:12.313]  Well, yeah, the Congress can say black people are slaves again.
[02:41:12.333 --> 02:41:13.274]  That doesn't make it so.
[02:41:13.574 --> 02:41:19.876]  Yeah, I also wanted to bring up the fact that this same little town where they have this, this little suburb, they have like seatbelt checkpoints.
[02:41:20.036 --> 02:41:24.138]  You know, they sit there in little bike tops and wait for you to pull up the light and just start handing out tickets.
[02:41:24.158 --> 02:41:25.338]  I mean, it's just outrageous.
[02:41:26.172 --> 02:41:30.194]  I wanted to also ask you, are you going to have Dr. Buchanek on anytime soon?
[02:41:30.234 --> 02:41:33.436]  I've been wondering what he's been up to and what his whole perspective on things is.
[02:41:34.076 --> 02:41:37.638]  Oh, the CFR guy that talked about the stage capture of Bin Laden.
[02:41:37.958 --> 02:41:38.598]  We might do that.
[02:41:38.899 --> 02:41:39.799]  Alright, well hey, thanks a lot.
[02:41:40.339 --> 02:41:41.160]  Thank you for the call.
[02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:42.220]  Always good to hear from you.
[02:41:42.861 --> 02:41:45.782]  Let us go now to Eric in Tennessee.
[02:41:46.282 --> 02:41:47.343]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[02:41:47.403 --> 02:41:47.643]  Good.
[02:41:50.123 --> 02:42:09.114]  I got in on the last part of your talk show today, so I'm not sure what all you've been talking about, but I went to your website and I am completely outraged about finding the article on there that you got that this right-wing group, this Free Republic, has created an enemies list.
[02:42:09.334 --> 02:42:10.795]  What are they, a bunch of brown shirts?
[02:42:11.795 --> 02:42:13.736]  Well, they're number one, they're not conservative.
[02:42:14.216 --> 02:42:14.476]  Right.
[02:42:15.897 --> 02:42:24.880]  I guess the new definition of Bush, assault weapons bans, open borders, campaign finance reform, signing on to UNESCO, they don't allow discussion of that.
[02:42:25.746 --> 02:42:30.389]  And people have posted my articles on there and they just say Alex Jones is not welcome here.
[02:42:31.150 --> 02:42:46.980]  And yeah, I do have a news article here about how there was a posting, you can't say really the forum did that, but it's one of the biggest websites out there, alternative news websites, and there was this enemies list posted mentioning the Berg family as an enemies list in Iraq.
[02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:50.142]  Yeah, I saw that and I saw where they were wanting to get
[02:42:50.700 --> 02:43:00.724]  A member of the Coast Guard, reading in that form, a member of the Coast Guard, they want to have him get the treatment and get roughed up because he was opposed to the war.
[02:43:01.184 --> 02:43:05.066]  It's like you can't have an opposite opinion anymore in this country.
[02:43:05.086 --> 02:43:10.548]  That is outright... I know, and there's comments like, this will really teach the family now!
[02:43:11.388 --> 02:43:19.411]  There you go, and I tell you what, I was wanting to ask you, Alex, have you recently gone over the Declaration of Independence?
[02:43:20.222 --> 02:43:30.927]  You know, it's funny, I printed that off last night, and I was going to, it's in my book, I reprinted it there, but I was tempted to re-read the Declaration of Independence today, it's funny you mention that, but I never got around to it.
[02:43:31.307 --> 02:43:38.210]  Okay, because there are several points that our founding fathers... Well, they were liberals!
[02:43:38.310 --> 02:43:39.010]  They were evil!
[02:43:39.511 --> 02:43:41.011]  According to the new neocons.
[02:43:41.171 --> 02:43:45.954]  Oh yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, they were free thinkers, and so that makes them evil liberals.
[02:43:46.174 --> 02:43:46.994]  You're right about that.
[02:43:47.034 --> 02:43:48.775]  I mean, those guys, you know, they gave us
[02:43:49.914 --> 02:43:56.116]  With the help from God, they gave us the best country that this earth has ever seen.
[02:43:56.136 --> 02:44:08.238]  But yet, now our government is training people and putting them through the schools that our founding fathers were no good and that they were communists and all this kind of nonsense.
[02:44:08.578 --> 02:44:11.339]  But I tell you what, this government,
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:13.744]  I don't even want to call it the government anymore.
[02:44:13.764 --> 02:44:20.036]  It's a pack of organized crime syndicates feeding on us, looting the country.
[02:44:20.792 --> 02:44:30.114]  Looting the pension funds, looting the treasury, a trillion two, one trillion two hundred billion dollars missing from the Pentagon.
[02:44:30.474 --> 02:44:38.956]  I mean, this is mass criminality and their excuse is, we're keeping you safe from the terrorists, and then you look at who's behind the terrorist attacks and it's the globalists.
[02:44:39.176 --> 02:44:44.297]  You got that right, and I'll tell you what, they have violated several points of the Declaration of Independence.
[02:44:45.417 --> 02:44:46.238]  Several points.
[02:44:46.478 --> 02:44:49.719]  You've gone off the Bill of Rights to the Communist Manifesto.
[02:44:49.739 --> 02:44:50.439]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:50.659 --> 02:44:51.040]  Thank you.
[02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:53.861]  But when you speak out against the Communist Manifesto, you're a liberal.
[02:44:54.141 --> 02:44:55.902]  When you're anti-gun, you're a conservative.
[02:44:55.922 --> 02:44:58.723]  You've got to learn the new double think, sir.
[02:44:59.543 --> 02:45:01.084]  It's bad when foreigners torture.
[02:45:01.164 --> 02:45:03.025]  It's good when we do it.
[02:45:03.065 --> 02:45:08.407]  You've got to learn how to have a sick mind to stay sane in this system.
[02:45:08.787 --> 02:45:09.748]  Mike in Florida.
[02:45:09.788 --> 02:45:10.488]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:45:11.209 --> 02:45:15.052]  Alex, thank you again for being the sane voice in our insane society.
[02:45:15.072 --> 02:45:18.154]  No need to thank me, I'm just doing my job, just standing up against tyranny.
[02:45:19.114 --> 02:45:37.146]  I was watching Fox News the other day with my mother, because that's what she depends on for her news, and I sat there and watched the prison video, and I said, well, you know, or the decapitation video, and I was like, and correct me if I'm wrong, because I immediately thought of you, and I was like, I've got to ask you, because I've been away from the computer, and I couldn't get you on the radio.
[02:45:37.706 --> 02:45:38.167]  And I said,
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:46:01.157]  And what I wanted to ask was, do you think that the reason for all of this is to reform the Army's policies on prison reform, so that they can make this new legislation to more properly train our armed forces for military policing and prison enforcement and stuff like that?
[02:46:02.498 --> 02:46:12.001]  Well, their answer is to give them more funding and to expand the brigades that can do this here domestically while they do urban warfare training and prepare to do this to the American people.
[02:46:12.421 --> 02:46:14.782]  And that's admitted in two of my films, Mainstream News.
[02:46:15.262 --> 02:46:18.743]  Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:46:18.803 --> 02:46:22.684]  But I believe this was purposefully released because they've had all this news for years.
[02:46:23.453 --> 02:46:46.657]  To then bring out the beheading video on top of it, and to legitimize torture, and as a political distraction overall, while NAFTA and GAAP get expanded, while the free trade area of the Americas get expanded, while the gas prices get ratcheted up, while the electronic voting machines get taken over by the CIA, while all this other really big stuff is happening, we're all talking about the torture.
[02:46:47.593 --> 02:46:49.734]  And we're not talking about the dead troops.
[02:46:50.074 --> 02:46:53.994]  We've got troops getting killed every day still over there, but you notice you don't hear about that anymore.
[02:46:54.395 --> 02:46:55.475]  We do not, absolutely.
[02:46:55.495 --> 02:47:01.736]  Two more, the other comment, there are 35, I believe, billionaires in Moscow, which tops New York City's 31.
[02:47:01.836 --> 02:47:04.417]  I just read that in, I think it was the Times.
[02:47:04.817 --> 02:47:09.058]  Yeah, and the people that were communist just said, oh, we're free market, but really they're just crime syndicate bosses.
[02:47:09.358 --> 02:47:10.678]  Nothing changed, just the label.
[02:47:11.278 --> 02:47:11.718]  Absolutely.
[02:47:11.958 --> 02:47:15.479]  And then the last thing, and this is more on the kind of like far side, but
[02:47:16.098 --> 02:47:21.100]  Have you ever heard of a guy named John Titor who was on the internet a while back?
[02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:22.060]  No.
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:26.282]  He made several predictions that were really telling of what... I'll send you guys a link.
[02:47:26.522 --> 02:47:27.162]  Okay, thank you.
[02:47:27.942 --> 02:47:30.743]  Last call and I'm going to hit some final news and a recap.
[02:47:31.143 --> 02:47:32.624]  Scott in Colorado, go ahead.
[02:47:34.847 --> 02:47:40.132]  Yeah, Alan Stang was talking about the upcoming draft of women, for girls and women.
[02:47:40.452 --> 02:47:42.714]  Yeah, Selective Service is preparing to register women.
[02:47:42.754 --> 02:47:44.376]  The draft boards have been reformed.
[02:47:44.696 --> 02:47:47.779]  They got 12 pieces of legislation, but the neocons still deny it.
[02:47:48.319 --> 02:47:58.989]  He referenced Muhammad Ali was able to get out by, he talked about the 13th Amendment, where we're not subject to involuntary servitude.
[02:47:59.383 --> 02:47:59.943]  That's right.
[02:48:00.083 --> 02:48:04.345]  And they said if they say come forward and you don't come forward, then you're not volunteering.
[02:48:04.725 --> 02:48:07.667]  And they can't force you to serve.
[02:48:07.907 --> 02:48:09.828]  I mean, it's just like the income tax.
[02:48:09.988 --> 02:48:11.589]  These other taxes are constitutional.
[02:48:11.849 --> 02:48:12.789]  The income tax isn't.
[02:48:12.809 --> 02:48:14.430]  They get you to sign a contract.
[02:48:14.750 --> 02:48:15.890]  It's contract fraud.
[02:48:16.631 --> 02:48:18.792]  He said we could tell our girls, don't step forward.
[02:48:20.365 --> 02:48:24.529]  And then, in a few spot cases where people don't know their rights, they'll put women in prison.
[02:48:25.049 --> 02:48:27.431]  And then that'll scare everybody else into going along with it.
[02:48:27.711 --> 02:48:32.215]  Bottom line, they can't enforce any of these illegal laws if we just refuse to follow them.
[02:48:32.972 --> 02:48:34.593]  And then people say the law is God.
[02:48:35.033 --> 02:48:37.854]  No, the Bible tells us not to follow illegal criminal laws.
[02:48:37.874 --> 02:48:40.516]  You can use the Hitler, Romans 13 all day.
[02:48:40.556 --> 02:48:42.917]  That doesn't work, because the Bible is replete with examples.
[02:48:43.157 --> 02:48:47.039]  But just common sense says, if the government says kill this baby, you don't do it.
[02:48:47.299 --> 02:48:50.980]  Or if the government says black people are our slaves, you don't follow that.
[02:48:51.561 --> 02:48:51.901]  That's right.
[02:48:51.981 --> 02:48:53.162]  Paul fought the good fight.
[02:48:54.362 --> 02:48:55.102]  And it is a fight.
[02:48:55.783 --> 02:48:56.143]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:48:56.917 --> 02:48:57.698]  You bet, my friend.
[02:48:57.718 --> 02:49:12.990]  Yeah, but since the dawn of time, people want to dominate and control and own others, want to enslave them, and they create the pretext, they create the crises to sell us on this, and it's time to see that, that the more control over our lives that we give these people, the worse things get!
[02:49:13.750 --> 02:49:15.452]  The more out of control things get!
[02:49:15.852 --> 02:49:19.675]  The more liberties and freedoms we lose as a society!
[02:49:21.633 --> 02:49:25.234]  It's now time to stop going along with this wickedness.
[02:49:25.494 --> 02:49:40.317]  It's now time to break our conditioning and see the big picture and to realize that as human beings we weren't designed by God to live like a bunch of spineless jellyfish every millisecond of our lives being tracked and traced and watched and categorized and chronicled.
[02:49:40.937 --> 02:49:41.837]  This isn't freedom!
[02:49:42.337 --> 02:49:47.638]  Police in black ski masks and giant prisons and face scanners on the street corners are not freedom!
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:53.623]  The military-industrial complex owns our law enforcement, owns our prisons.
[02:49:54.063 --> 02:49:55.044]  It's big business!
[02:49:55.364 --> 02:50:02.388]  They make money off the drug war, packing the prisons with their slaves, working for 20 cents an hour, taking everybody else's jobs!
[02:50:05.790 --> 02:50:15.777]  And the big secret is the government ships in the narcotics, they control the drug trade, then they legalize over these prescription drugs that are chemically even worse than the narcotics themselves!
[02:50:17.798 --> 02:50:18.679]  They're killing us!
[02:50:20.123 --> 02:50:22.724]  They're the cult of power and wickedness and evil.
[02:50:22.764 --> 02:50:24.664]  They enjoy their sadistic control.
[02:50:24.964 --> 02:50:25.865]  This is who they are.
[02:50:25.925 --> 02:50:29.486]  They don't produce cars or houses or literature.
[02:50:29.586 --> 02:50:33.487]  They produce slavery and despotism and dehumanization.
[02:50:33.647 --> 02:50:35.067]  They stomp on our heads!
[02:50:35.247 --> 02:50:37.888]  They ground our guts into the carpet!
[02:50:39.569 --> 02:50:40.869]  Stop being their slaves!
[02:50:40.969 --> 02:50:42.109]  Stop putting up with it!
[02:50:42.309 --> 02:50:44.090]  Resist the New World Order!
[02:50:46.121 --> 02:50:50.448]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.629 --> 02:50:54.996]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:57.551 --> 02:50:59.613]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:50:59.693 --> 02:51:02.436]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:51:02.757 --> 02:51:06.981]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:07.041 --> 02:51:13.989]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:14.109 --> 02:51:16.131]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.371 --> 02:51:26.814]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:27.094 --> 02:51:32.455]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:51:47.498 --> 02:51:51.640]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:51:51.740 --> 02:51:54.621]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:51:54.701 --> 02:52:01.425]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:52:01.605 --> 02:52:04.586]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:52:04.806 --> 02:52:07.208]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:52:07.328 --> 02:52:12.070]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:26.816]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.

[02:53:56.570 --> 02:53:57.550]  I'll say it again.
[02:53:58.891 --> 02:54:00.493]  Since the dawn of time,
[02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:11.608]  Strong men have gotten together and figured out ways of scaring the tribe into submission with phony wars, with false crises.
[02:54:14.130 --> 02:54:16.292]  And they're doing the same thing today.
[02:54:16.372 --> 02:54:19.434]  This drug war is a total and complete fraud.
[02:54:19.454 --> 02:54:21.976]  They ship the garbage in.
[02:54:22.016 --> 02:54:23.277]  They create the crisis.
[02:54:24.238 --> 02:54:27.961]  It then creates the crimes as the junkies try to get the goods.
[02:54:28.681 --> 02:54:30.403]  They then pack the private prisons.
[02:54:31.590 --> 02:54:34.015]  And now this war on terror is the exact same thing.
[02:54:34.055 --> 02:54:41.051]  They create these foreign enemies, they fund them, they carry out the terror attacks, all to push more control.
[02:54:43.004 --> 02:54:43.745]  Look at this article.
[02:54:44.305 --> 02:54:46.707]  A fight over teenagers' secret abortion.
[02:54:46.867 --> 02:54:47.808]  London Evening Standard.
[02:54:47.828 --> 02:54:53.252]  A major debate raised today over whether a 14-year-old girl should have been allowed to have an abortion without her mother being told.
[02:54:53.613 --> 02:55:00.899]  So you've got to have a permission slip to have your 14-year-old daughter go to the zoo or the museum or the planetarium, but not to have an abortion.
[02:55:01.099 --> 02:55:01.920]  And that's in Europe.
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:03.661]  The same thing goes on here in the U.S.
[02:55:04.462 --> 02:55:06.023]  Just to show you how crazy things are.
[02:55:07.658 --> 02:55:14.647]  I mean, they'll arrest a 12-year-old if they bring aspirin to school for their headache without... I mean, they'll criminally charge them.
[02:55:14.687 --> 02:55:15.488]  That happens all the time.
[02:55:15.988 --> 02:55:17.130]  But go have your abortion.
[02:55:18.411 --> 02:55:22.135]  Rumsfeld visits Abu Ghraib in the eye of the abuse storm.
[02:55:22.336 --> 02:55:24.098]  Reuters, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld visited
[02:55:25.467 --> 02:55:34.370]  Baghdad's prison today flying in on the eve of the storm over Americans torturing prisoners that has shredded Washington's credibility in Iraq.
[02:55:34.390 --> 02:55:47.454]  Hours after lawmakers viewed sadistic new photographs of abuse, Rumsfeld arrived at what was Saddam Hussein's most notorious prison where seven US military police reservists are charged with sexually and physically tormenting detainees.
[02:55:48.275 --> 02:55:49.155]  You mean torturing them.
[02:55:51.010 --> 02:56:00.617]  Four hours into the announcement to Baghdad, he had already met Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, the commander of the Iraq, and Major General Jeffrey Miller, the new prison head there.
[02:56:02.299 --> 02:56:02.959]  Disgusting!
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:09.404]  The neocons say it's all legitimized now because somebody supposedly cut Berg's head off.
[02:56:09.444 --> 02:56:13.487]  So now, if somebody commits a murder in your town, you get to commit murder according to them.
[02:56:14.748 --> 02:56:16.570]  And it's just bad training anyways.
[02:56:16.690 --> 02:56:17.891]  Just blowing off some steam.
[02:56:18.271 --> 02:56:20.773]  Just having a good time, as Rush Limbaugh said.
[02:56:22.515 --> 02:56:31.203]  We are out of time, my friends, but remember, any time you give up liberty for so-called security, you don't get liberty, you get absolute tyranny, you get enslavement.
[02:56:32.444 --> 02:56:36.028]  Here on the Prison Planet, and it's now time for you to wake up.
[02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:42.314]  And we're doing server maintenance on PrisonPlanet.tv, all the members can access the video.

[02:57:12.856 --> 02:57:17.118]  This new JPFO, Jews the Preservation of Firearms video is so good.
[02:57:17.278 --> 02:57:17.939]  Gotta get it.

[02:57:26.363 --> 02:57:29.265]  That is the videos I produce, not the other ones.

[02:57:48.912 --> 02:57:55.277]  The more control we give over our lives to the establishment, the more freedoms we lose and the more insecure we are.
[02:58:09.187 --> 02:58:14.768]  Because there's the incentive there to give you more crises if you grovel at their feet wanting to be their slaves.
[02:58:15.408 --> 02:58:16.768]  And get your mind around this.
[02:58:16.948 --> 02:58:22.990]  You don't want to be a slave master, but the people in power are there in power because they enjoy the exercise of power.
[02:58:23.610 --> 02:58:29.591]  So stop being naive and wake up now and join us in this historical fight against the New World Order and tyranny.
[02:58:30.171 --> 02:58:31.631]  Back tonight, 9 to Midnight Central.

[02:58:39.221 --> 02:58:41.986]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:58:42.266 --> 02:58:46.432]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:58:46.853 --> 02:58:47.694]  So what do you do?

[02:58:53.055 --> 02:58:55.156]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
