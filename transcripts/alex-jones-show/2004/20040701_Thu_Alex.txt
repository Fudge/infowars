[00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.601]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:11.122]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:12.682]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.702 --> 00:00:17.164]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.564 --> 00:00:24.067]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:30.150]  Every morning when I wake up, it's as if I have
[00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:38.201]  We've gotten deeper into an episode of The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, an Alfred Hitchcock movie.
[00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:41.323]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:52.189]  It's already Thursday, the first day of July 2004, and I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.931]  Your host will be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:57.912]  I do this broadcast Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[00:01:00.132 --> 00:01:03.113]  And back from nine to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:07.533]  We have several great guests coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:07.573 --> 00:01:09.434]  I'll tell you about those a little bit later.
[00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:12.434]  One of them is Fenton Dunn from Break for News.
[00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:16.375]  And they do break a lot of important news and do a lot of great analysis.
[00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:25.256]  And they brought out some information concerning Sybil Edmonds and the cover-up going on in the Whitewash 9-11 Commission.
[00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:28.437]  Remember, she was the FBI translator
[00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:37.189]  Ordered to go back and falsify prior knowledge reports before 9-11, and then they threatened to arrest her if she didn't shut up.
[00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:39.571]  And they said, if you do shut up, we'll pay you off.
[00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:42.952]  We're also lining up Mrs. Edmonds for the broadcast.
[00:01:45.173 --> 00:01:47.595]  There is so much here, though, before me today.
[00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:50.576]  One of these articles I could spend three hours on.
[00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:51.877]  One of them.
[00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:56.959]  I mean, look at this one.
[00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.100]  Americans could be pressured into mandatory community service.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.441]  Well, that's NS89, but here it is in the news.
[00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:03.221]  We'll go over it.
[00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:06.263]  Defiant Saddam calls Bush real criminal.
[00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:07.903]  Says trial is theater.
[00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:10.284]  Well, I have to agree with that.
[00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:11.585]  I mean, I'm no fan of Saddam.
[00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.626]  A CIA hitman ordered to invade.
[00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:15.887]  Iran ordered, you know, go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:26.148]  Horrible person, but he's like a Mafia captain, and then the Mafia Don is the judge over him when the guy followed the orders of the Mafia Don.
[00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.290]  And it is theater!
[00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.792]  This new government in Iraq is publicly appointed.
[00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:36.995]  They're publicly going, this is freedom, we're gonna set up martial law, that's been in the news, they're saying martial law is freedom.
[00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:39.697]  I mean, again, it's the Twilight Zone here!
[00:02:40.017 --> 00:02:40.618]  It's 1984!
[00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:42.859]  Martial law is not freedom!
[00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.501]  Appointed governments is not freedom!
[00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:47.463]  They've got Chalabi's nephew running the trial!
[00:02:47.523 --> 00:02:48.844]  It's a kangaroo trial!
[00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:49.964]  It is theater!
[00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:52.887]  Well, you must be for Saddam!
[00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:54.348]  No, I'm not for Saddam!
[00:02:54.388 --> 00:02:55.949]  And I'm not for his bosses either!
[00:03:02.543 --> 00:03:04.344]  Taliban claims to have shot down U.S.
[00:03:04.404 --> 00:03:05.605]  aircraft killing 13.
[00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:11.829]  New Zealand school ban sought for unvaccinated children and then they take your children because they have to go to school.
[00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.470]  They're trying that here in the U.S.
[00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.951]  as well.
[00:03:15.372 --> 00:03:17.693]  Yesterday we talked about the U.S.
[00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:22.736]  government, and this is the British government admitting they were ordered to attack Iran, to attack Iranians.
[00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:23.657]  They refused.
[00:03:24.498 --> 00:03:28.760]  Well now we know what part of this big Summer Pulse 04
[00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:33.916]  You know, 10 aircraft carriers out to sea is all about.
[00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:35.357]  U.S.
[00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:37.237]  plants huge show of force at the Pacific.
[00:03:37.597 --> 00:03:40.818]  We knew the name months ago was Pulso 4, presence with purpose.
[00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:47.981]  But now, seven of these are to be in a maneuver off the coast of China and North Korea.
[00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:50.201]  And several others going to the Middle East.
[00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:53.442]  Also, here's the big article.
[00:03:53.662 --> 00:03:55.343]  Here's the one I could spend three hours on.
[00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.833]  Plans to cancel elections after terror attacks!
[00:04:01.914 --> 00:04:05.777]  And this is out of the AP, the Associated Press.
[00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.962]  I mean, there's been a lot of talk about this, my friends.
[00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:14.384]  And the White House told U.S.
[00:04:14.444 --> 00:04:20.009]  News & World Report a month ago that there will be massive terror attacks, and we will take your rights.
[00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.852]  And top generals have said martial law is good here, too, just like it is in Iraq.
[00:04:25.555 --> 00:04:29.616]  I got this article in front of me where they just tell us that we just may cancel the election.
[00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.997]  The government is being directed to prepare for that.
[00:04:32.017 --> 00:04:33.178]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:37.539]  I mean, come on.
[00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:40.540]  I guess they'll start appointing our government, too.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.421]  Then just say, well, that's freedom.
[00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:45.161]  You're not for Al-Qaeda, are you?
[00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:47.642]  Well, then you must be for the appointed government.
[00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:49.703]  You're not against torture, are you?
[00:04:51.444 --> 00:04:52.744]  Why, the President's above the law.
[00:04:53.982 --> 00:04:56.373]  Folks, every article is of the same magnitude.
[00:04:56.494 --> 00:04:58.502]  I have a giant stack of about 80 stories.
[00:04:58.522 --> 00:04:59.145]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:03.746]  My family's breathing easier and now you can too!
[00:05:03.926 --> 00:05:07.288]  Hey folks, Michael Trudell here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[00:05:07.388 --> 00:05:09.589]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:15.733]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:18.514]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[00:05:18.774 --> 00:05:19.434]  Nothing escapes!
[00:05:19.555 --> 00:05:23.777]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:27.579]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:29.920]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone!
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.480]  Smoke?
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.601]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:35.842]  Our BioZone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[00:05:36.042 --> 00:05:40.143]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your BioZone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[00:05:40.303 --> 00:05:42.964]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.

[00:06:00.757 --> 00:06:05.089]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.641]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.361]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:41.493]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.753 --> 00:06:47.116]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:51.398]  Visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.438 --> 00:06:51.698]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:53.299]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:00.243 --> 00:07:08.873]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:07:09.093 --> 00:07:20.326]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:23.228]  Yep, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:30.033]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:07:30.193 --> 00:07:32.054]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:07:32.254 --> 00:07:38.279]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:44.203]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:07:44.523 --> 00:07:53.029]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:57.112]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:57.412 --> 00:07:58.733]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:08.239]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.822]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:19.258]  Alright, second segment, 8 minutes and 15 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:19.318 --> 00:08:21.899]  Again, several great guests coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:24.960]  Let's launch straight into the news.
[00:08:28.922 --> 00:08:40.226]  Again, 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, I talk about the government moving forward with plans for secret arrest, secret detention of Americans, secret execution.
[00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:46.050]  I said the government would use the threat of terrorism that they would orchestrate to get all of this through.
[00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:49.972]  Where's Alex coming up with all of this?
[00:08:50.052 --> 00:09:03.320]  Man, he's talking about a world with police in black ski masks and uniforms and armored vehicles everywhere and cameras on every street corner and wide open borders at the same time and foreign troops and Pan-American unions.
[00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:14.689]  Well, all I was doing was reading the public RAND Corporation and DARPA reports and CFR publications and... I mean, that's all I've ever done.
[00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:20.231]  They're building a hell for you and I. You go, why would they do that?
[00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:23.053]  Because that ensures their monopoly of control and power.
[00:09:23.853 --> 00:09:25.394]  That's what elites do throughout history.
[00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:26.974]  That's the norm.
[00:09:27.715 --> 00:09:29.295]  Freedom is the exception.
[00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:32.057]  And so, you want to be slaves?
[00:09:32.077 --> 00:09:33.017]  You want to be serfs?
[00:09:34.065 --> 00:09:35.046]  They're going to be served.
[00:09:35.086 --> 00:09:37.027]  But they're going to teach you how to love your slavery.
[00:09:37.227 --> 00:09:38.127]  How to praise it.
[00:09:38.728 --> 00:09:39.908]  Through the popular culture.
[00:09:40.989 --> 00:09:43.130]  How to be good little mind control minions.
[00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:43.931]  How to love it.
[00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:48.934]  How to willingly inject your children with deadly vaccines that brain damage them.
[00:09:49.134 --> 00:09:52.416]  How to slurp down the toxic water that flows from your tap.
[00:09:54.497 --> 00:10:01.381]  How to eat the genetically modified food and ask for seconds and drink the milk full of growth hormone and beg for more.
[00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:09.230]  How to drink the soft drinks and 9,000 plus foods full of aspartame, which is just wood alcohol.
[00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.031]  How to beg to be mindless slaves.
[00:10:15.092 --> 00:10:18.933]  And they do it all just by getting us used to it, training us, conditioning us.
[00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:26.295]  Just like a mountain lion or a wolf might sneak up on a little deer out in a glade.
[00:10:26.675 --> 00:10:30.477]  They incrementally get closer and closer, edging up on you.
[00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:31.677]  Now they're just a few feet away.
[00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:42.353]  Our whole way of life, our children's futures, everything evaporating before our eyes and people say, don't be so negative while we're doing great.
[00:10:42.733 --> 00:10:43.433]  No, we're not.
[00:10:46.955 --> 00:10:50.457]  Plans to cancel elections after terror attacks.
[00:10:52.578 --> 00:10:57.440]  This is from the Associated Press, it's on presentplanet.com, it's on infowars.com right now.
[00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:02.803]  The government needs to establish guidelines for canceling or
[00:11:03.726 --> 00:11:05.307]  Rescheduling elections?
[00:11:06.669 --> 00:11:13.214]  If terrorists strike the United States again, says the chairman of the new Federal Voting Commission.
[00:11:14.855 --> 00:11:22.382]  Such guidelines do not currently exist, said DeForest B. Soares, head of the voting panel.
[00:11:23.524 --> 00:11:25.145]  See, all this is in plain view.
[00:11:25.546 --> 00:11:31.930]  Soares was appointed to the Federal Election Assistance Commission last year by President Bush.
[00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:35.173]  Oh, he's independent like the Commission on 9-11 appointed by Bush.
[00:11:36.234 --> 00:11:45.641]  Soares said he wrote the National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge in April to raise the concern.
[00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:49.504]  See, he was appointed and then magically he came up with this idea on his own.
[00:11:50.828 --> 00:11:58.250]  Yeah, the military's just been saying if there's another big attack, martial law is good, cancel elections, can't leave our homes, we're all enemy combatants.
[00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.390]  That's the head of FEMA in New Jersey, by the way.
[00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.651]  He might take what he has to say a little bit serious.
[00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:05.131]  I am still awaiting their response.
[00:12:05.151 --> 00:12:08.492]  He said, thus far, we have not begun any meaningful discussion.
[00:12:08.652 --> 00:12:09.592]  Sure you haven't.
[00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:13.813]  Spokesman for Rice and Ridge did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
[00:12:14.053 --> 00:12:19.735]  Yeah, you're just already federalizing most major cities covertly under a covert, unannounced red alert, aren't you?
[00:12:20.055 --> 00:12:20.395]  Aren't you?
[00:12:22.045 --> 00:12:23.907]  It's a dictatorship, folks, right in your face.
[00:12:24.367 --> 00:12:37.538]  Sorley's noted that September 11, 2001 fell on election day in New York City and said that officials there had no rules to follow in making the decision to cancel the election and hold it till later.
[00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:48.227]  Events in Spain, where the government got caught blowing stuff up, but that's a side issue, events in Spain where a terrorist attack shortly before the March election possibly influenced its outcome,
[00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:57.435]  Show the need for a process to deal with terrorists threatening or interrupting the November 2nd presidential elections in America, he said.
[00:12:58.235 --> 00:13:03.358]  Look at the possibilities of the federal government for to cancel an election or suspend an election
[00:13:04.085 --> 00:13:09.550]  It has tremendous political implications if the federal government chose not to suspend an election.
[00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:17.076]  It has political implications, and it said so, or he's a Republican and a former Secretary of State of New Jersey.
[00:13:17.456 --> 00:13:18.437]  Who makes the call?
[00:13:18.977 --> 00:13:21.379]  Under what circumstances is the call made?
[00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:24.541]  What are the constitutional implications, he said?
[00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:30.506]  I think we have to err on the side of transparency to protect the voting rights of the country.
[00:13:30.526 --> 00:13:32.508]  That's some nice double speak.
[00:13:33.817 --> 00:13:40.220]  Soares said his bipartisan four-member commission might make a recommendation to Congress about setting up guidelines.
[00:13:41.241 --> 00:13:44.283]  I'm hopeful that there are some proposals already being floated.
[00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:46.904]  If there are, we're not aware of them.
[00:13:47.424 --> 00:13:50.886]  If there are not, we will probably try to put one on the table, he said.
[00:13:51.487 --> 00:14:01.592]  Soares also said he met with former New York State elections director to discuss how officials there handle the September 11th attacks from the perspective of election administration.
[00:14:02.219 --> 00:14:06.086]  He said the Commission is getting information from New York, documenting the process used there.
[00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:15.542]  The state controls elections, but on the national scale, where every state has its own election law and its own election chief, who's in charge?
[00:14:16.357 --> 00:14:21.341]  Sordes also said he wants to know what federal officials are doing to increase security on election day.
[00:14:21.381 --> 00:14:33.309]  He said security officials must take care not to allow heightened security measures to intimidate minority voters, oh like Florida, but the local and state election officials he's talked to have not been told what measures to expect.
[00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:40.654]  There's got to be communication, he said, that means federal control, between law enforcement and election officials in preparation of November.
[00:14:42.623 --> 00:14:44.845]  Okay, I could spend hours explaining how this works.
[00:14:44.905 --> 00:14:49.147]  We haven't had a real presidential election since they blew Kennedy's head off in 1963.
[00:14:50.108 --> 00:14:54.551]  That's when the voter news services, under a previous name, took over.
[00:14:54.851 --> 00:14:55.912]  And you're going, what do you mean?
[00:14:55.952 --> 00:14:58.393]  Well, do you know how they announce on the news who the winner is?
[00:14:59.014 --> 00:15:05.298]  A private group, in New York, with armed guards, that no one's allowed to look into, tells you who the winners are.
[00:15:05.918 --> 00:15:11.942]  And then in almost every election, it's later matched with the states, and does it match, and states really went with other people, but there's never a discussion of it.
[00:15:12.675 --> 00:15:15.676]  And whoever loses just goes along with it, because it's a stage theater.
[00:15:17.077 --> 00:15:19.398]  You go, well, why did Al Gore and Bush have this big fight?
[00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:25.420]  That was to train you that, oh, these chads don't work, because there was full-scale fraud going on by the government.
[00:15:26.398 --> 00:15:27.779]  Uh, we need touchscreen.
[00:15:27.979 --> 00:15:31.302]  Oh, and then Chuckie Schumer brings out the bill for five billion dollars.
[00:15:31.782 --> 00:15:37.687]  Five plus billion to put in the touchscreen system, publicly run by the CIA, stealing elections coast to coast.
[00:15:37.947 --> 00:15:41.130]  Then they divvy up and divide the spoils amongst each other.
[00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.673]  Now, at record levels, Democrats are running unopposed, Republicans are running unopposed.
[00:15:45.874 --> 00:15:48.796]  They're just dividing up the country among themselves.
[00:15:51.394 --> 00:15:52.795]  And so what's going on with this?
[00:15:52.835 --> 00:15:53.736]  What's really happening?
[00:15:53.956 --> 00:15:56.278]  I mean, how do you call an election?
[00:15:56.298 --> 00:16:05.846]  You know, they're calling Al Gore the winner of Florida, and then suddenly Bush's cousin at Fox announces it for Bush, and Bush smiles and says, don't worry, I will win.
[00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:10.670]  And then, and I'm sorry, folks, I've always been a Republican, but I'll tell you, Al Gore won that election.
[00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.331]  And I don't mean popular votes.
[00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:13.552]  I believe in the Electoral College.
[00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:16.215]  So one region doesn't get too much power.
[00:16:17.315 --> 00:16:20.238]  I believe in that apportionment of the states according to population.
[00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:22.469]  Through the House and the Senate.
[00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:24.310]  With its two Senators.
[00:16:25.891 --> 00:16:27.793]  With a further separation of powers.
[00:16:27.833 --> 00:16:34.437]  But certainly, Choice Point and Harris and the Bushes and his brother did steal the election.
[00:16:35.298 --> 00:16:36.999]  And the Democrats just laid there and took it.
[00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:38.700]  Because it was a staged event.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.923]  So we've already had a Supreme Court appoint a President and Vice President.
[00:16:44.584 --> 00:16:47.906]  Which was the Supreme Court appointed by the President's father and himself.
[00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:53.664]  Now he's moving forward to get more federal judges and more power positions.
[00:16:55.286 --> 00:16:59.849]  And so we've already had a bizarre election in 2000, just getting you ready for this in 2004.
[00:17:01.411 --> 00:17:07.336]  Now the government, Bush has said, we will be hit by terrorists, the Capitol will be destroyed.
[00:17:07.356 --> 00:17:11.959]  That's scenario one, and simultaneously coast-to-coast attacks.
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:13.841]  Now that's U.S.
[00:17:13.861 --> 00:17:16.123]  News & World Report, Associated Press, Reuters.
[00:17:17.205 --> 00:17:25.491]  And now they're saying if there is an attack, they may cancel elections, and boy, gee, they're thinking of ways to have the feds run things locally to keep us all safe.
[00:17:26.372 --> 00:17:36.219]  Because it's become quite embarrassing that the non-electronic voting machines will show one candidate wins, but all the diabolical show the other candidate winning, or the other companies that are out there.
[00:17:37.606 --> 00:17:41.068]  And that, you know, the state numbers don't match what the feds later say.
[00:17:41.368 --> 00:17:42.948]  So this is total federal control.
[00:17:43.309 --> 00:17:48.831]  Major cities like Detroit, Michigan, New Orleans, Louisiana have publicly been federalized.
[00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:54.353]  They're putting CIA and National Guard in and FEMA command centers that were built in the late 1990s.
[00:17:57.736 --> 00:17:59.597]  This is happening from Maine to Texas.
[00:18:00.237 --> 00:18:01.638]  It is hell upon earth.
[00:18:02.118 --> 00:18:04.980]  It is a Soviet-slash-Nazi model.
[00:18:06.081 --> 00:18:09.963]  Just like in Iraq, we have troops in every city and appoint puppets.
[00:18:10.323 --> 00:18:11.784]  It's the same thing now in America.
[00:18:12.504 --> 00:18:14.566]  The electronic machines appoint the puppets.
[00:18:15.086 --> 00:18:33.482]  You think you have an election and they garrison troops with helicopters surveilling your cities, with the command centers hooked into the wireless cameras around your city, with the CIA firmly ensconced, with secret military police interrogating and harassing people for their First Amendment rights publicly.
[00:18:35.024 --> 00:18:37.606]  I mean, look, they're all lined up, folks.
[00:18:37.626 --> 00:18:39.928]  You know, it's like offense and defense and
[00:18:40.976 --> 00:18:48.398]  The quarterback goes break in the huddle, and they all line up, and everybody's tense, and the quarterback's starting to go, Green 23!
[00:18:48.618 --> 00:18:49.158]  Green 24!
[00:18:49.218 --> 00:18:49.499]  Hoot!
[00:18:49.699 --> 00:18:49.899]  Hoot!
[00:18:49.979 --> 00:18:50.199]  Hoot!
[00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:50.759]  Hoot!
[00:18:50.959 --> 00:18:52.059]  And he's on the last hut!
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.940]  You understand, he's on the last hoot!
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.221]  He's starting to say, Hoot!
[00:18:56.561 --> 00:18:57.521]  Last hut, folks!
[00:18:57.781 --> 00:18:58.121]  Hoot!
[00:18:58.681 --> 00:18:59.522]  And then, boom!
[00:18:59.542 --> 00:19:04.083]  They're all coming together, and the hammer drops, and you get to be real live slaves!
[00:19:05.006 --> 00:19:09.047]  And then they get to lay off seven times what they've laid off in the high-tech.
[00:19:09.347 --> 00:19:11.508]  And they get to bring in even more unskilled workers.
[00:19:11.708 --> 00:19:17.589]  And they get to really lower your wages and pay you less as the dollar itself is worth less and less.
[00:19:17.629 --> 00:19:25.151]  And you get to learn and you get to watch the Super Bowl as we hail the Emperor and get to be a part of the regal worship of government.
[00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:27.431]  And I just hope you love it.
[00:19:28.872 --> 00:19:30.592]  I just hope you all enjoy it.
[00:19:32.633 --> 00:19:34.593]  We're a country that supported 50 million babies.
[00:19:35.956 --> 00:19:38.458]  We're a country that's taught the world how to torture.
[00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:41.560]  We're a country that's gone to the devil!
[00:19:44.042 --> 00:19:46.284]  And now, we're gonna be judged.
[00:19:47.985 --> 00:19:54.791]  All of you, myself included, I feel the mouth of hell opening for us.
[00:19:55.731 --> 00:19:56.592]  Can we stop it?
[00:19:56.632 --> 00:19:57.653]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[00:20:01.192 --> 00:20:01.952]  Terrorism.
[00:20:02.112 --> 00:20:02.853]  Terrorism.
[00:20:02.973 --> 00:20:09.034]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:10.875]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:20:11.115 --> 00:20:13.596]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:20:13.996 --> 00:20:28.560]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:28.920]  government.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.901]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:20:31.261 --> 00:20:37.186]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:20:37.306 --> 00:20:41.790]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:22:00.031 --> 00:22:01.011]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:05.874]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:13.837]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:14.097 --> 00:22:19.480]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:26.683]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:26.963 --> 00:22:32.307]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:32.567 --> 00:22:37.290]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:45.255]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:45.576 --> 00:22:51.059]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.761]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.003 --> 00:22:58.264]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.185 --> 00:23:02.007]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:23:02.127 --> 00:23:02.967]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:23:03.087 --> 00:23:06.390]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.812]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident.
[00:23:10.032 --> 00:23:12.234]  That injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:23:12.354 --> 00:23:15.437]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:23:15.657 --> 00:23:19.921]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:23:20.121 --> 00:23:22.042]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[00:23:22.163 --> 00:23:29.229]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:31.891]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:23:32.171 --> 00:23:34.852]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[00:23:34.992 --> 00:23:36.493]  Only this time it changed my life.
[00:23:36.773 --> 00:23:38.534]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[00:23:38.614 --> 00:23:40.735]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[00:23:40.895 --> 00:23:43.356]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[00:23:43.396 --> 00:23:46.097]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[00:23:46.297 --> 00:23:46.818]  Side effects?
[00:23:46.998 --> 00:23:49.259]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now too.
[00:23:49.419 --> 00:23:50.699]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[00:23:50.739 --> 00:23:50.940]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.520]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.201]  It worked for me.
[00:24:02.303 --> 00:24:07.466]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.146 --> 00:24:10.488]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:13.809 --> 00:24:16.751]  How do we avert what the globalists are building what they're doing?
[00:24:17.251 --> 00:24:19.793]  This repeat of history with a high-tech overlay.
[00:24:21.554 --> 00:24:22.655]  Well, it's really quite simple.
[00:24:22.715 --> 00:24:24.676]  They test the wind, the water.
[00:24:25.456 --> 00:24:28.338]  They analyze their focus groups where the people are.
[00:24:30.109 --> 00:24:32.110]  They admit they've done focus groups on what will happen.
[00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:32.930]  This has been in the news.
[00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:37.472]  If there's a terror attack, will it help keep the administration in or get them out, as if it even matters?
[00:24:38.932 --> 00:24:41.053]  Bush's cousin, Lord Kerry.
[00:24:43.314 --> 00:24:52.317]  And if we expose that government is behind the terror, that giving up liberty gives us tyranny, not security, if everyone at the grassroots level screams bloody murder,
[00:24:53.357 --> 00:25:03.844]  If police and military refuse to go along with what they're trying to set up, the world they're trying to build, the control grids they're trying to put in place, this program will fall apart.
[00:25:04.905 --> 00:25:06.326]  And it's already been greatly damaged.
[00:25:06.867 --> 00:25:11.470]  We have responded to them energetically at a level I don't think they foresaw.
[00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:17.874]  And so we have a chance, but things are very, very serious.
[00:25:17.914 --> 00:25:19.936]  We know the world they're trying to build.
[00:25:21.457 --> 00:25:28.480]  The worst of Nazi Germany, the worst of the Soviet Union, with a brave new world, high-tech dressing.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.781]  I hope all of you are aware of this.
[00:25:31.841 --> 00:25:40.724]  So there's open discussions of suspending the election from the Associated Press, from the Federal Elections Commission, and these other unsundry groups.
[00:25:43.479 --> 00:25:45.901]  And then we have articles like this with news from views.
[00:25:46.181 --> 00:25:50.624]  America could be prepared and could be pressed into mandatory community service.
[00:25:51.004 --> 00:25:56.368]  The Universal National Service Act of 1903 sitting in the 108th Congress isn't getting much attention in the media.
[00:25:56.708 --> 00:26:11.539]  But as many Americans are very concerned about what it will mean if signed into law by President Bush, after the terror attack of course they'll carry out, in the Senate, S89, sponsored by Ernest Hollings, a Democrat,
[00:26:12.535 --> 00:26:26.905]  And it continues, reads, to provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes.
[00:26:26.965 --> 00:26:29.386]  And it has a whole bunch of Republican sponsors, co-sponsors.
[00:26:30.047 --> 00:26:32.768]  The House of Representatives has a sister bill, H.R. 163,
[00:26:34.429 --> 00:26:38.590]  Sponsored by Charles Rangel, which contains the same language.
[00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.912]  Both bills will make it mandatory for women to serve in the military as well as men.
[00:26:41.952 --> 00:26:45.133]  The age window for induction is 18 to 26.
[00:26:47.353 --> 00:26:57.057]  And it goes on talking about how it angers Americans because it gets into, this government thinks they can press free citizens into involuntary servitude for 20 to 30 hours per week.
[00:26:58.701 --> 00:27:08.286]  In support of security for the motherland, Americans don't understand how clever the communists are in their quest for global domination because they don't study history.
[00:27:09.286 --> 00:27:12.828]  Community service, especially forced community service, is rooted in communist doctrine.
[00:27:13.228 --> 00:27:13.488]  Ms.
[00:27:14.089 --> 00:27:21.252]  Beauchamp went on to state that the legislation would not withstand the 13th Amendment challenge of the U.S.
[00:27:21.292 --> 00:27:23.974]  Constitution against involuntary servitude.
[00:27:23.994 --> 00:27:26.255]  That's Lauren Beauchamp, a
[00:27:28.713 --> 00:27:37.676]  Lawyers studying, paralegal studying for a law degree in New York majored in world history and says Americans don't fully appreciate the danger behind this type of legislation.
[00:27:37.736 --> 00:27:55.722]  One of the people they interviewed for this article, Section 1 of the 13th Amendment of the Constitution states, neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist in the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
[00:27:57.987 --> 00:27:59.367]  Very, very interesting, isn't it?
[00:28:02.569 --> 00:28:04.829]  There's so much here that I want to cover.
[00:28:04.929 --> 00:28:11.752]  Let's get into this now, then we'll get into all the military drills going on, and then take some of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:28:11.772 --> 00:28:16.013]  Defiant Saddam calls Bush real criminal, says trial is theater.
[00:28:22.009 --> 00:28:33.673]  A defiant and downcast Saddam Hussein rejected charges against him as he appeared before an Iraqi judge yesterday, or actually this morning, telling the court, this is all theater.
[00:28:34.413 --> 00:28:38.874]  The real criminal is Bush, a CNN pool report said.
[00:28:39.555 --> 00:28:45.196]  Saddam's hands were cuffed when he was brought into the court for the arraignment, which lasted about 30 minutes.
[00:28:45.236 --> 00:28:46.757]  The cuffs were taken off when he went in.
[00:28:47.748 --> 00:28:50.270]  I am Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq.
[00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.771]  The CNN pool reporter quoted Saddam Hussein.
[00:28:53.191 --> 00:29:04.058]  Saddam was flown by helicopter from an undisclosed location, where he's guarded by the US military, supposedly in Iraqi custody, in the puppet government custody, and driven to a courtroom on the US base.
[00:29:04.118 --> 00:29:16.025]  He was led from an armored bus, escorted by two Iraqi prison guards, and unhursed through a door, or ushered through a door, guarded by six
[00:29:16.858 --> 00:29:23.984]  More, Iraqi policemen, according to CNN, which had a pool reporter monitoring the hearing, the bus was escorted by four Humvees and an ambulance.
[00:29:25.465 --> 00:29:32.891]  Again, Saddam is like a mafia capo, and the don that ordered him to do all the stuff he did is the judge, you know, is the government.
[00:29:34.453 --> 00:29:38.876]  I mean, the new president was a former top Ba'athist, and he's an appointee.
[00:29:40.398 --> 00:29:41.919]  And, uh, just incredible.
[00:29:43.134 --> 00:29:45.877]  We'll come back into all these military training drills and much more.
[00:29:45.938 --> 00:29:47.600]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.463]  Please stay with us.

[00:29:54.488 --> 00:29:58.073]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.488 --> 00:30:02.909]  Somebody wants to sue you.

[00:31:55.041 --> 00:31:56.285]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:00.882 --> 00:32:02.223]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[00:32:02.403 --> 00:32:06.145]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck too.
[00:32:06.325 --> 00:32:10.047]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[00:32:10.347 --> 00:32:13.969]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[00:32:14.209 --> 00:32:18.631]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[00:32:18.951 --> 00:32:22.753]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[00:32:22.993 --> 00:32:23.714]  It really works!

[00:32:30.357 --> 00:32:31.458]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[00:32:31.758 --> 00:32:34.279]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[00:32:34.439 --> 00:32:37.701]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps, and air tools.

[00:32:43.143 --> 00:32:44.584]  Diesel engines thrive on it too.

[00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:21.437]  I want to thank all the AM and FM affiliates that carry this broadcast.
[00:33:22.318 --> 00:33:26.259]  Also, WWCR during the day on Global Shortwave, you can listen.
[00:33:27.288 --> 00:33:32.833]  At 94.75, 9.475 and of course at night from 9 to midnight at 32.10.
[00:33:32.973 --> 00:33:42.760]  If your AM or FM station doesn't carry the nighttime show from 9 to midnight, you ought to ask them to because a lot of folks don't get a chance to hear the broadcast during the day.
[00:33:43.781 --> 00:33:56.171]  But if they don't, you can always listen at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or prisonplanet.tv or as I said, on the Global Shortwave.
[00:33:57.967 --> 00:34:01.769]  Okay, we're going to go to your calls, Carlos and others that are holding here in a few minutes.
[00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:03.630]  The total free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:03.750]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:15.016]  But before I do that, first I want to plug my videos and stuff, then I want to cover some of this Iraq handover, this puppet total transparent theater, as I call it.
[00:34:24.688 --> 00:34:27.730]  As their former business partner, Saddam, calls it, interestingly enough.
[00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:33.653]  But first off, my friends, again, I've made ten films.
[00:34:34.673 --> 00:34:36.554]  And the latest film is Matrix of Evil.
[00:34:37.535 --> 00:34:42.538]  The video is... let me see... a little over two hours long.
[00:34:42.578 --> 00:34:50.862]  It has Congressman Ron Paul talking about the New World Order, the Iraq War, the Patriot Act, John Ashcroft, the Democrats, all of it.
[00:34:50.902 --> 00:34:52.303]  We expose the whole corrupt system.
[00:34:53.223 --> 00:34:56.525]  It has Cynthia McKinney who is unseated for exposing U.N.
[00:34:56.585 --> 00:34:59.386]  and government involvement in 9-11 and we interview her.
[00:34:59.686 --> 00:35:00.787]  So it's bipartisan.
[00:35:01.287 --> 00:35:02.568]  Wake up the Democrats as well.
[00:35:03.849 --> 00:35:05.649]  Colonel Craig Roberts is in the video.
[00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.550]  Frank Morales, police state expert.
[00:35:07.911 --> 00:35:08.571]  Myself.
[00:35:08.631 --> 00:35:10.292]  We throw the Patriot Act out in Austin.
[00:35:10.612 --> 00:35:11.573]  Video of that happening.
[00:35:12.133 --> 00:35:14.274]  People really like the Matrix of Evil.
[00:35:15.709 --> 00:35:23.516]  Also, there's police state, three total enslavement, two hours, 44 minutes long, what the New World Order is, who the neocons are, the fake left-right paradigm.
[00:35:23.756 --> 00:35:25.337]  That's the first 25-30 minutes.
[00:35:25.517 --> 00:35:26.178]  Very important.
[00:35:26.658 --> 00:35:36.346]  And the rest of it is Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, the RFID chips, the GPS, the New World Order, government-sponsored terror.
[00:35:36.386 --> 00:35:42.391]  I mean, it's just... If you're getting one film just to be fully informed on things, I guess it's the video.
[00:35:43.672 --> 00:35:51.641]  It's really a video I'd get if you already have the others, because it's kind of the more graduate level, you know, graduate student level type stuff.
[00:35:52.362 --> 00:35:55.586]  Fast moving, jam-packed, it's really three or four films in one.
[00:35:56.006 --> 00:36:00.352]  Then there's my two 9-11 films, 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, part two of that, The Masters of Terror.
[00:36:01.403 --> 00:36:03.484]  We've got America, Wake Up, or Waco.
[00:36:03.564 --> 00:36:06.045]  We've got the other Police State videos, one and two.
[00:36:06.725 --> 00:36:08.606]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:36:09.026 --> 00:36:12.387]  The anniversary of my infiltration four years ago is coming up in just a few days.
[00:36:13.008 --> 00:36:16.229]  And when we snuck in and got the satanic ritual on tape, and that's all in the film.
[00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:18.770]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.732]  My videos are $25.95 apiece.
[00:36:22.752 --> 00:36:25.192]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[00:36:25.373 --> 00:36:26.233]  Big discount, folks.
[00:36:26.815 --> 00:36:33.079]  You save $18 on the 3-tape special, $24 on the 4-tape special, $30 on the 5-tape special, and so on.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.162]  And your purchase is vital for the future of this broadcast and supports us.
[00:36:39.122 --> 00:36:42.024]  And also, you're authorized to make copies of the videos I've produced.
[00:36:42.785 --> 00:36:45.346]  Now, I carry other videos made by other folks.
[00:36:46.187 --> 00:36:49.649]  Jews, the Preservation of Firearms, Ownerships video, Innocence Betrayed.

[00:37:50.348 --> 00:37:51.248]  Large colored book.

[00:38:33.314 --> 00:38:34.395]  These videos are working.
[00:38:34.635 --> 00:38:39.338]  Help us expose the people responsible for the New World Order and 9-11.
[00:38:40.759 --> 00:38:45.543]  Russia hails transfer of power to Iraqi interim government.
[00:38:46.764 --> 00:39:00.154]  Now, two weeks ago, when the presidency and the government had been caught at least 50 times planning fake weapons evidence, making up dossiers, where it had been totally proven that Saddam had destroyed his weapons of mass destruction, sold to him by the U.S.
[00:39:00.194 --> 00:39:06.518]  and Russia, Putin pops up, a murdering person who's been caught blowing up his own buildings and blaming it on his political enemies.
[00:39:06.538 --> 00:39:09.521]  I mean, that's admitted, you know, Moscow Times stuff, folks.
[00:39:10.401 --> 00:39:11.042]  BBC.
[00:39:12.182 --> 00:39:15.505]  Just a former KGB chieftain, I mean, just a horrible demon,
[00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:20.270]  Indescribable crimes, arresting people, criticizing, you name it.
[00:39:22.292 --> 00:39:28.537]  Okay, KGB people are good, I'm sorry, I'm being liberal because I'm against the KGB, but now FSB.
[00:39:29.318 --> 00:39:32.621]  He hailed Bush and said yes, that he had evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
[00:39:32.881 --> 00:39:36.284]  Well now he hails the handover and calls it very real and good.
[00:39:37.162 --> 00:39:46.026]  He thinks it's wonderful and Russia today welcomed the transfer of power to the Iraqi interim government as an important step in the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution.
[00:39:47.726 --> 00:39:53.849]  And it says the transfer of power in Iraq is in general an important step towards implementing Security Council Resolution 1546.
[00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:56.490]  And it goes on and on.
[00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.191]  So again, a loving
[00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:01.871]  I wouldn't even call them communists.
[00:40:01.891 --> 00:40:02.912]  They never were communists.
[00:40:02.952 --> 00:40:04.573]  Communism doesn't exist in the real world.
[00:40:04.914 --> 00:40:14.302]  The thugs that rule those 240 million people over there agree with their buddy, Lord Bush, the CIA Director's son.
[00:40:14.963 --> 00:40:17.505]  All these former intelligence chiefs and people running our countries.
[00:40:18.424 --> 00:40:18.684]  U.N.
[00:40:18.704 --> 00:40:21.326]  prepares for bigger role in Iraq following handover of power.
[00:40:21.346 --> 00:40:23.227]  I told you a full year before the war they do that.
[00:40:23.827 --> 00:40:26.088]  They play the good cop, we play the part of the bad cop.
[00:40:26.608 --> 00:40:30.250]  We're actually increasing troop levels and Bush's will go under U.N.
[00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.691]  law and our troops will be liable under U.N.
[00:40:32.731 --> 00:40:34.432]  law where they have no due process.
[00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:38.374]  So, pretty serious stuff there.
[00:40:39.775 --> 00:40:41.155]  Everything going according to their plan.
[00:40:41.636 --> 00:40:42.456]  Judge says C.I.
[00:40:42.496 --> 00:40:44.137]  contractor must stay jailed.
[00:40:46.133 --> 00:40:49.216]  And remember last week they said they're charging him under the Patriot Act.
[00:40:49.256 --> 00:40:51.638]  He followed orders and tortured people to death.
[00:40:52.498 --> 00:40:53.799]  Which he should be charged.
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.322]  But his bosses should be charged even more seriously.
[00:40:57.362 --> 00:41:00.465]  And we have the memos where they were ordered to take the gloves off and torture.
[00:41:00.545 --> 00:41:01.145]  By Rumsfeld.
[00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:03.627]  But he can't talk to the media.
[00:41:04.108 --> 00:41:10.213]  And it's going to be a secret trial because they admit, Associated Press last week, it is the Patriot Act.
[00:41:10.273 --> 00:41:10.713]  So see?
[00:41:12.635 --> 00:41:13.095]  So see?
[00:41:14.536 --> 00:41:15.537]  They're using it.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:23.203]  Against their own people so they can burn patsies, burn minions, burn scapegoats, and then not let them defend themselves.
[00:41:23.343 --> 00:41:25.424]  I thought it was just for Al-Cieda.
[00:41:26.785 --> 00:41:31.047]  Well, no, it's for the goons, the prison guards they hire and do that.
[00:41:31.327 --> 00:41:37.950]  So, to all of you out there, they'll order you to do this, then they'll charge you with a Patriot Act so you can't expose them.
[00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:43.172]  It's like you're not going to hear anything Saddam has to say in this kangaroo Iraq court once it gets rolling.
[00:41:44.673 --> 00:41:45.153]  Same thing!
[00:41:46.195 --> 00:41:48.237]  Same thing.
[00:41:48.257 --> 00:41:49.938]  Okay.
[00:41:50.619 --> 00:41:51.360]  Let's go to calls.
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.821]  Carlos in California.
[00:41:52.861 --> 00:41:53.842]  Thanks for holding, my friend.
[00:41:53.862 --> 00:41:54.162]  Welcome.
[00:41:54.983 --> 00:41:59.326]  It's a pleasure listening to you, Ken.
[00:41:59.527 --> 00:42:13.859]  Listen, there's another form of terrorism which is being imposed on, of course, humanity by the New World Order, besides radical Islam, and that is the ecological destruction, so-called facade of ecological destruction,
[00:42:14.642 --> 00:42:15.383]  We're good to go.
[00:42:38.466 --> 00:42:42.832]  Yeah, it's total serfdom.
[00:42:42.852 --> 00:42:55.648]  And to boil this down, there are environmental crises, there are problems, but if you look at who funds all the big environmental groups, it's Dutch Shell, the Ford Foundation, Lapue Charitable Trust,
[00:42:56.108 --> 00:42:57.549]  Well, you know, what's even more scary, Alex, is that
[00:43:26.105 --> 00:43:39.152]  If you read between the lines as to what's being stipulated and implied by these laws, by the air charter laws, is that they're going to force a half reduction on world food production.
[00:43:39.892 --> 00:43:42.934]  They're going to cause scarcity.
[00:43:43.527 --> 00:43:44.248]  We're good to go.
[00:44:01.156 --> 00:44:11.349]  And five, six years ago the UN said we're going to claim there's no fresh water, we're going to claim there's no oil, we're going to have our surrogates put this out, and then we're going to double and triple the prices for all this.
[00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:15.735]  And yes, they'd rather sell you a gallon of water for ten times what it's worth
[00:44:16.375 --> 00:44:18.757]  Well, you know, that's the way for them to get around to their one main objective.
[00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:40.688]  Which is to lessen the world's population.
[00:44:41.168 --> 00:44:45.549]  It is, and they bring in through the crisis, through the... I mean, look, I saw the day after tomorrow.
[00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:48.290]  It is a two-hour ad for world government.
[00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:50.911]  It is a two-hour ad for martial law.
[00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:55.172]  It is a two-hour ad for getting us ready for huge disasters.
[00:44:55.252 --> 00:44:56.432]  It is a giant U.N.
[00:44:56.632 --> 00:44:56.792]  ad.
[00:44:57.293 --> 00:44:58.553]  And again, the left thinks the U.N.
[00:44:58.613 --> 00:44:59.293]  is going to save us.
[00:44:59.553 --> 00:45:00.053]  The U.N.
[00:45:00.093 --> 00:45:02.254]  was created by the military industrial complex.
[00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:04.031]  Exactly.
[00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:07.498]  Well, you know, some of that is already happening.
[00:45:07.518 --> 00:45:13.168]  You know, the IMF, of course, has all these corporations they're affiliated with.
[00:45:13.757 --> 00:45:19.661]  And they're going into Latin countries and taking over through privatization of all the water systems.
[00:45:20.602 --> 00:45:25.085]  And they use the term privatization like they call this forced drugging of the population new freedom.
[00:45:25.125 --> 00:45:26.145]  It's always doublespeak.
[00:45:26.466 --> 00:45:29.308]  We had the World Bank documents thrown on the website two plus years ago.
[00:45:29.748 --> 00:45:40.195]  In Argentina, they come pay off the politicians publicly, have them implode the economy, and when everything falls apart they can buy it all up for pennies on the dollar, and then overnight they quadruple the price of water,
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.361]  Fuel, everything.
[00:45:42.601 --> 00:45:44.142]  This is done by design.
[00:45:44.182 --> 00:45:44.922]  You're on the money.
[00:45:45.463 --> 00:45:46.443]  Yes, and exactly.
[00:45:46.483 --> 00:45:52.747]  You know, people are already dying in Latin America because of the high prices of water.
[00:45:52.887 --> 00:46:08.156]  There was a Washington Post article where a cattle trailer in the capital city of Argentina topped over and former middle class people were with knives cutting gobs of raw flesh out, gobbling them on the side of the road and photos were taken of this.
[00:46:09.488 --> 00:46:12.730]  Yeah, I mean, it's going to become a very scary scenario.
[00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:14.631]  By the way, Argentina was nice.
[00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:17.953]  I mean, it was as high a standard of living as the United States.
[00:46:18.534 --> 00:46:28.520]  Middle class, wealthy, doing well, a lot of resources, informed, educated people, and now they have one of the lowest standards of living in three years!
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.822]  From the highest in Latin America to one of the lowest.
[00:46:32.867 --> 00:46:37.692]  Well, exactly, and that's going to go all across Latin America, and eventually it's going to get here to the United States.
[00:46:37.892 --> 00:46:47.061]  And then that's going to drive tens of millions more Latin Americans up here, who I don't blame wanting a good job, but there's not going to be a good job for them, and it's going to drive down our wages, Carlos!
[00:46:47.731 --> 00:46:52.073]  Well, exactly, and then they're going to force privatization on us, too, once we're bankrupt.
[00:46:52.553 --> 00:46:55.115]  They're going to take over all of our... And again, what is privatization?
[00:46:55.155 --> 00:46:56.375]  The same thing we did in Russia.
[00:46:56.735 --> 00:47:08.621]  The former communist leaders suddenly become the private owners, you know, the ten oligarchs, now the six oligarchs, and when everything's bankrupt, they go, we'll get all the oil in Russia for one billion dollars.
[00:47:08.861 --> 00:47:10.922]  Here's a billion dollars, I get five trillion now.
[00:47:12.043 --> 00:47:16.745]  And so the government then sells itself everything, and then they become private owners.
[00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:25.123]  Well, you know, the bottom line, Alex, we've got to be very leery when corporations start taking over the water systems of the world.
[00:47:25.763 --> 00:47:30.226]  Once they create a monopoly, they're going to hold the world hostage.
[00:47:30.266 --> 00:47:32.247]  Just like Enron did in California for energy.
[00:47:32.287 --> 00:47:32.868]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:33.708 --> 00:47:34.669]  Great call, Carlos.
[00:47:34.689 --> 00:47:35.589]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:47:35.629 --> 00:47:36.350]  Surf them, folks.
[00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:38.151]  These corporations are not free market.
[00:47:38.391 --> 00:47:39.652]  They're organized crime syndicates.
[00:47:39.992 --> 00:47:41.733]  Harold and KC in Kansas City.
[00:47:41.753 --> 00:47:42.134]  Go ahead.
[00:47:42.794 --> 00:47:43.635]  Hello, Alex.
[00:47:44.754 --> 00:47:56.722]  I just want to tell you that this morning I was watching on C-SPAN and they had a call in program and the question was should the U.S.
[00:47:57.002 --> 00:48:00.525]  reinstate the draft and the host on that program was reading
[00:48:00.939 --> 00:48:01.319]  I don't know.
[00:48:20.475 --> 00:48:22.537]  There was like only one that objected to it.
[00:48:23.058 --> 00:48:29.865]  And is this like the part of the mindset to get the American people thinking, hey, OK, we need this?
[00:48:29.965 --> 00:48:38.514]  And so when they do start to vote on this in Congress and pass it, then the American people will say, oh, hey, yeah, this is it.
[00:48:38.554 --> 00:48:41.217]  Look, look, almost everybody I talk to is against the draft.
[00:48:41.815 --> 00:48:47.159]  But what they do is they're quietly introducing it, giving us the arguments for it, and then we argue against it.
[00:48:47.179 --> 00:48:48.220]  They go, oh, we're not going to do that.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.182]  And then as soon as we turn our head, yeah, the draft's good, the draft's good.
[00:48:51.522 --> 00:48:52.262]  Hey, we don't want a draft.
[00:48:52.282 --> 00:48:53.183]  We didn't say there's a draft.
[00:48:53.423 --> 00:48:55.425]  So that's psychological warfare tactic.
[00:48:55.845 --> 00:48:56.345]  Exactly.
[00:48:57.146 --> 00:48:58.147]  So what were the people saying?
[00:48:58.467 --> 00:48:59.408]  Yeah, we gotta serve.
[00:48:59.448 --> 00:49:00.909]  This war on terror is serious.
[00:49:00.969 --> 00:49:02.630]  We gotta pay our fair share.
[00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:05.292]  Well, it seemed like they were program callers.
[00:49:05.492 --> 00:49:08.255]  By that I mean most of them had already served in the military.
[00:49:08.295 --> 00:49:16.421]  They were like the baby boomer generation or had served in Vietnam and they were saying, like, oh this was good because I went and put my time in.
[00:49:16.642 --> 00:49:22.326]  Or even, going back to say the Korean conflict, I was drafted, had to go in and made a better man out of me, you know?
[00:49:22.487 --> 00:49:31.074]  Well, I've tried to call into C-SPAN in the last six months and they'll say, for or against, for Democrat or Republican or Independent, and I'll say, well this is what I want to say, and they'll hang up on me.
[00:49:31.875 --> 00:49:38.798]  So, when they're not doing screening calls, I've watched it, and most people are anti-New World Order, but I think they're starting to screen calls.
[00:49:40.279 --> 00:49:40.879]  Obviously.
[00:49:40.919 --> 00:49:43.761]  That was probably, yeah, because everybody I talk to is against the draft.
[00:49:43.801 --> 00:49:44.301]  I mean, come on.
[00:49:44.601 --> 00:49:45.241]  Yes, yes.
[00:49:45.662 --> 00:49:48.583]  Well, I just thought I would pass that on for you and your listeners.
[00:49:48.663 --> 00:49:51.424]  So, he just had article after article about how great the draft is.
[00:49:51.544 --> 00:50:00.729]  Yes, not one article was against it, and I hope that they will re-air that later on tonight or something, but that was earlier this morning on C-SPAN.
[00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:04.491]  Totally disgusting!
[00:50:04.592 --> 00:50:08.575]  So, are you going to send your children off to breathe depleted uranium and take deadly vaccines?
[00:50:09.296 --> 00:50:09.476]  No.
[00:50:10.197 --> 00:50:10.417]  No.
[00:50:10.577 --> 00:50:12.579]  No.
[00:50:13.159 --> 00:50:18.864]  I just hope the eyes of the American people will truly, truly be... Even after Al Qaeda attacks?
[00:50:19.645 --> 00:50:21.947]  The CIA, yeah.
[00:50:22.548 --> 00:50:24.589]  So, anyway, I just wanted you to know that.
[00:50:25.558 --> 00:50:31.542]  I'm avid listener of you every day, and like I said, it was a privilege to meet you when you came to Kansas City a year ago.
[00:50:31.562 --> 00:50:33.403]  Well, it was great to meet all you guys and gals.
[00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:34.004]  Yeah.
[00:50:34.444 --> 00:50:34.724]  Okay.
[00:50:34.764 --> 00:50:36.606]  Well, keep up the good work, and I'll be praying for you.
[00:50:37.086 --> 00:50:37.746]  You bet, my friend.
[00:50:37.766 --> 00:50:38.047]  Thank you.
[00:50:38.067 --> 00:50:39.087]  We'll be praying for all of you.
[00:50:39.708 --> 00:50:40.588]  We need the prayers.
[00:50:41.729 --> 00:50:42.450]  Boy, I tell you.
[00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:48.434]  Yeah, National Draft, open borders, cameras everywhere.
[00:50:48.454 --> 00:50:51.296]  I got a whole stack of Big Brother news here.
[00:50:51.316 --> 00:50:52.957]  I got some guests coming up, too.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.506]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:50:55.707 --> 00:50:57.032]  Keep fighting, keep moving forward.
[00:50:57.052 --> 00:50:58.015]  We're in the fight, folks.
[00:50:58.417 --> 00:50:59.520]  We got a dog in this fight.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.821]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.001 --> 00:51:06.102]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.222 --> 00:51:10.123]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.163 --> 00:51:14.425]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.745 --> 00:51:18.526]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.666 --> 00:51:20.487]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.667 --> 00:51:23.988]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.028 --> 00:51:25.109]  The medical bills!
[00:51:26.789 --> 00:51:28.730]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:31.931]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.111 --> 00:51:34.992]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.452 --> 00:51:41.574]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.114 --> 00:51:45.896]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:46.316 --> 00:51:47.677]  Order your video today.
[00:51:48.057 --> 00:51:49.058]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.118 --> 00:51:51.619]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.659 --> 00:51:52.860]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:52:01.115 --> 00:52:04.116]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.436 --> 00:52:09.358]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.618 --> 00:52:13.980]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:23.183]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.384 --> 00:52:27.005]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.305 --> 00:52:32.347]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.627 --> 00:52:39.350]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.851 --> 00:52:40.391]  What about you?
[00:52:41.141 --> 00:52:46.045]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.
[00:52:46.085 --> 00:52:46.505]  A $14 savings.
[00:52:46.545 --> 00:52:47.646]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:52:47.726 --> 00:52:49.608]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:53:02.259 --> 00:53:02.600]  I think so.
[00:53:17.503 --> 00:53:18.164]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.026 --> 00:53:50.127]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.287 --> 00:53:56.248]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:09.891]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.491 --> 00:54:13.432]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:17.072 --> 00:54:26.778]  Alright, we got Vincent Dunn from Break4News joining us with some major developments with the civil Edmonds 9-11 whitewash commission situation.
[00:54:27.699 --> 00:54:29.380]  Right now let's go to Randy in Florida.
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.501]  Randy, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:42.328]  Mr. Alex, I heard you say yesterday that there were no abuses by the American Patriots during the Revolutionary War.
[00:54:43.157 --> 00:54:56.300]  Well, I may have said that, not that I'm aware of, and I know even the British historians commented that our troops were very well behaved compared to the British and German troops.
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:06.242]  There were atrocities and barbarism on both sides, not only against each other, but against the loyalists and the revolutionaries here.
[00:55:07.802 --> 00:55:08.522]  The Tories?
[00:55:09.442 --> 00:55:09.763]  Right.
[00:55:10.783 --> 00:55:11.743]  Okay, give me an example.
[00:55:12.185 --> 00:55:21.108]  Well, there was one battle at Cowpens, I think, where several of the prisoners were hacked to death after they surrendered.
[00:55:21.668 --> 00:55:27.769]  And these were American citizens fighting on the British side.
[00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:29.610]  Interesting, all right.
[00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:40.193]  And there were also a lot of hangings and stuff, too, that were going on between colonists on both sides of the conflict.
[00:55:40.683 --> 00:55:43.465]  Oh, that was going on in the Civil War.
[00:55:44.986 --> 00:55:46.628]  I mean, certainly I've seen cases of that.
[00:55:46.648 --> 00:55:53.793]  So, you know, I mean, it was equally atrocious on both sides in certain places and times.
[00:55:53.913 --> 00:56:03.800]  You know, I had just from my studies that, let's just say, the colonialist behavior, the Continental Army's behavior, was better than that of the British.
[00:56:04.601 --> 00:56:05.442]  Overall, sure.
[00:56:05.922 --> 00:56:07.603]  I'm just saying that backfired on the British.
[00:56:08.991 --> 00:56:13.935]  The Constitution Party had their convention and named Michael Pruitt as their official candidate last week.
[00:56:13.975 --> 00:56:15.216]  Are you going to have him on, by any chance?
[00:56:15.236 --> 00:56:18.578]  You know, I get calls every day about that, and I just might do that.
[00:56:19.539 --> 00:56:25.324]  Well, that would be a good time to start the ball rolling to get him on, now that he's a declared candidate.
[00:56:25.724 --> 00:56:26.104]  Okay.
[00:56:27.625 --> 00:56:29.867]  On your website, you've got a bad link on there.
[00:56:29.887 --> 00:56:35.551]  The animated cartoon that talks about American dictators, skull and bones, Kerry and Bush.
[00:56:35.972 --> 00:56:36.252]  Yeah?
[00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:38.674]  When you go to click play, it doesn't work.
[00:56:39.457 --> 00:56:41.378]  It works for me, perhaps.
[00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:44.960]  I've had it on several different computers all week and I can't get it to run.
[00:56:45.261 --> 00:56:48.503]  Okay, well do me a favor, just email me and email the webmaster, okay?
[00:56:49.023 --> 00:56:49.343]  Okay.
[00:56:49.483 --> 00:56:50.484]  Thanks for the call, Randy.
[00:56:51.184 --> 00:56:52.885]  Let's talk to Kevin in California.
[00:56:52.905 --> 00:56:54.206]  Kevin, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:56:54.986 --> 00:56:55.827]  Yes, this is Kim.
[00:56:56.387 --> 00:56:56.727]  Okay.
[00:56:57.268 --> 00:57:00.410]  On June the 18th, Pennsylvania passed hate crimes legislation.
[00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:04.012]  It was signed by the governor and the dead of midnight on June the 18th of this year.
[00:57:04.641 --> 00:57:08.778]  It says that verbal abuse is now a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.
[00:57:10.501 --> 00:57:10.921]  And a $50,000 fine?
[00:57:11.062 --> 00:57:12.643]  Yeah, I saw that.
[00:57:12.683 --> 00:57:32.338]  There's now these thought crimes, and it's not even cuss words or racial stuff, which they shouldn't be able to regulate because it's the First Amendment, but because when they start with that, then it moves into something that someone feels hurts their feelings, and that's why we have BBC reporters being arrested for what they say in England now, because it might hurt someone's feelings.
[00:57:32.818 --> 00:57:36.401]  But especially if you criticize homosexuality, that was added to the bill,
[00:57:37.041 --> 00:57:44.227]  And, uh, so if a preacher gets up and he says that homosexuality is an abomination according to the word of God, he can get five years in prison, $50,000 fine.
[00:57:44.347 --> 00:57:51.353]  Well, actually, last year the outgoing governor, Mark Schweiker, signed the bill that did that.
[00:57:51.533 --> 00:57:53.114]  Are you sure you're not looking at a... No, no, no, no.
[00:57:53.435 --> 00:57:57.158]  This one added homosexuality and transsexuality to the other bill.
[00:57:57.178 --> 00:57:58.359]  Yeah, I remember seeing that, yeah.
[00:57:58.399 --> 00:57:59.560]  Yeah, so this is horrendous.
[00:58:01.521 --> 00:58:03.603]  I mean, if this was made national, can you imagine?
[00:58:04.381 --> 00:58:07.842]  Well, this is the system where you can't criticize, where you don't have a First Amendment.
[00:58:08.302 --> 00:58:08.502]  Right.
[00:58:08.903 --> 00:58:12.724]  And over and over again, it's Republicans giving us this.
[00:58:12.804 --> 00:58:13.464]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:58:15.085 --> 00:58:15.945]  It boggles the mind.
[00:58:16.645 --> 00:58:17.525]  It boggles the mind.
[00:58:17.806 --> 00:58:23.067]  You would think that a Republican would stand up for civil liberties, but that's not the case.
[00:58:24.628 --> 00:58:26.328]  But Putin says Bush is good.
[00:58:26.368 --> 00:58:27.369]  Shouldn't we listen to him?
[00:58:27.409 --> 00:58:28.209]  He's a nice man.
[00:58:29.289 --> 00:58:30.770]  I don't even want to go there.
[00:58:32.631 --> 00:58:33.011]  Thank you.
[00:58:33.151 --> 00:58:34.813]  Did you say the name was Kim?
[00:58:35.393 --> 00:58:35.793]  Ken.
[00:58:36.274 --> 00:58:36.474]  Ken.
[00:58:36.494 --> 00:58:37.855]  Yeah, I said Ken when I answered.
[00:58:37.875 --> 00:58:38.876]  Oh, I thought you said Kevin.
[00:58:38.996 --> 00:58:39.256]  Oh, sorry.
[00:58:39.596 --> 00:58:40.257]  No, I guess I did.
[00:58:40.317 --> 00:58:40.697]  You know what?
[00:58:40.737 --> 00:58:43.079]  We'll just call you Bob from California.
[00:58:43.099 --> 00:58:43.699]  How does that sound?
[00:58:43.939 --> 00:58:44.280]  Fair enough.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:45.160]  Alright, man.
[00:58:45.501 --> 00:58:46.321]  Thanks a lot, buddy.
[00:58:46.741 --> 00:58:47.242]  Take care.
[00:58:47.922 --> 00:58:48.803]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:57.529 --> 00:58:58.110]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.823 --> 00:58:59.884]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.585 --> 00:59:01.666]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.346 --> 00:59:03.167]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.928 --> 00:59:04.829]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:09.273]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.673 --> 00:59:13.777]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.458 --> 00:59:17.780]  Alright, my friends, it's the first day of July 2004.
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:17.961]  Already,
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:23.661]  30 seconds into the second hour.
[00:59:23.681 --> 00:59:31.944]  We're going to be joined by Fenton Dunne from England with Break4News.com, a great website and a good researcher with some new developments concerning the 9-11 whitewash.
[00:59:32.984 --> 00:59:34.425]  We're about to go right back to your calls.
[00:59:34.945 --> 00:59:50.451]  Then we'll get into the Associated Press, plans to cancel the election after terror attaches the headline, a bunch of Big Brother news, a ton of news that I haven't even gotten to yet about giant naval drills that are now mainstream news that people called a conspiracy theories a month and a half ago.
[00:59:51.355 --> 00:59:52.656]  And, uh, the U.S.
[00:59:52.696 --> 00:59:56.697]  telling, um, what I talked about yesterday, telling the British to attack Iran.
[00:59:57.297 --> 00:59:59.758]  Just a lot more of key information coming up.
[01:00:00.398 --> 01:00:03.079]  But right now, let's go to Ted in Australia.
[01:00:03.699 --> 01:00:05.740]  Ted, in the land down under.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.140]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:07.761]  How are you?
[01:00:07.781 --> 01:00:08.161]  Welcome, sir.
[01:00:09.021 --> 01:00:09.621]  Thank you very much.
[01:00:09.641 --> 01:00:10.041]  How are you?
[01:00:10.321 --> 01:00:10.642]  Good.
[01:00:10.702 --> 01:00:11.582]  Good to have you on with us.
[01:00:12.222 --> 01:00:12.922]  Oh, thank you very much.
[01:00:12.982 --> 01:00:15.903]  I just called to say, um, I get your program on the Internet.
[01:00:16.524 --> 01:00:17.944]  It's about 3 o'clock in the morning here.
[01:00:18.144 --> 01:00:20.005]  And, uh, I like your program.
[01:00:20.025 --> 01:00:20.685]  It's very interesting.
[01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:25.594]  Well, you know, it's rebroadcast from 9 to midnight at 9.
[01:00:28.496 --> 01:00:31.678]  So you could actually get up in the morning at 7 or 8 in the morning and hear it as well.
[01:00:32.478 --> 01:00:33.819]  Yes, I know that.
[01:00:33.859 --> 01:00:35.220]  We get it about midday.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:36.020]  Great.
[01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:38.202]  Down here in Australia.
[01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:41.864]  But, no, I also told a few mates of mine about your program.
[01:00:42.724 --> 01:00:43.865]  And they reckon it's good.
[01:00:45.746 --> 01:00:48.748]  Well, we feel for you guys having a lot of your guns taken.
[01:00:49.648 --> 01:00:52.070]  What's the New World Order doing to you right now in Australia?
[01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:59.852]  Well, it's very interesting, actually, because your government wants to build a big base down here.
[01:01:00.132 --> 01:01:01.072]  That's right, yes.
[01:01:01.492 --> 01:01:02.973]  Yes, a big base.
[01:01:03.113 --> 01:01:05.874]  Which will make you a big, fat target of the Communist Chinese.
[01:01:07.175 --> 01:01:10.296]  Well, they've already got Pyongyang, and they've got a few others.
[01:01:11.016 --> 01:01:20.000]  But, you see, the move is on Asia, because when we went into Asia, as far as
[01:01:21.732 --> 01:01:29.674]  As far as East Timor is concerned, we went there for the gas and oil, and now the East Timorese are suing the Australian Government.
[01:01:31.035 --> 01:01:33.655]  Because they're saying we're not getting enough out of this.
[01:01:34.515 --> 01:01:47.459]  The Australian Government are saying, no, no, no, that's on our side, and they're saying, no, it's on our side, and it's the big oil companies, obviously, that are going to pinch all that from the East Timorese.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:48.981]  Absolutely.
[01:01:49.021 --> 01:01:55.485]  Are people aware of the New World Order in your country, and are they upset about this war in Iraq, or do they support it?
[01:01:56.766 --> 01:01:58.087]  No, they don't support it at all.
[01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:01.489]  You see, nobody gave our Prime Minister permission to go to war.
[01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:05.252]  There's a lot of people that don't support it because he made us a target.
[01:02:06.593 --> 01:02:07.593]  We don't support Bush either.
[01:02:09.555 --> 01:02:11.076]  You don't want to come down here and mention his name.
[01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:17.360]  Because the last time he was down here, your wonderful Secret Service took over Canberra.
[01:02:18.274 --> 01:02:19.334]  They took the whole town over.
[01:02:19.354 --> 01:02:22.155]  You know, they had guns and God knows what else.
[01:02:22.435 --> 01:02:23.395]  It wasn't on TV.
[01:02:23.955 --> 01:02:26.396]  And you couldn't get anywhere near the Parliament.
[01:02:26.716 --> 01:02:35.478]  Well, when Bush went to an African country, they actually arrested a bunch of people and bulldozed shantytowns on the road from the airport just because it wouldn't look good on TV.
[01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:38.058]  I mean, that's the level of staged events.
[01:02:38.778 --> 01:02:39.739]  It was like last year in
[01:02:42.671 --> 01:02:53.339]  Nigeria, the Queen didn't want to meet with villagers, so they had a stage meeting, this came out in the BBC, at a soap opera set, a TV show set.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:03.145]  Hey, did you hear after the Bali bombing, how your government said, we're going to use the DNA we took from all Australians at birth to identify these people?
[01:03:03.426 --> 01:03:06.228]  Oh, by the way, we've got a national DNA database we didn't tell you about?
[01:03:06.868 --> 01:03:08.309]  Yes, yes, we heard about that.
[01:03:10.282 --> 01:03:15.823]  I did a broadcast here for about six years, I just semi-retired now, on the New World Order.
[01:03:16.304 --> 01:03:18.464]  And we followed all this sort of thing going along.
[01:03:18.824 --> 01:03:20.285]  Well, I ought to interview you sometime.
[01:03:20.325 --> 01:03:21.145]  What's your full name?
[01:03:22.225 --> 01:03:23.185]  My name's Ted Atta.
[01:03:24.806 --> 01:03:25.806]  Well, Ted, that's interesting.
[01:03:25.846 --> 01:03:26.946]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:03:26.966 --> 01:03:28.507]  No, no, that's it.
[01:03:28.567 --> 01:03:29.707]  You've just got a nice program.
[01:03:30.987 --> 01:03:31.988]  But answer my question.
[01:03:32.848 --> 01:03:37.149]  Is there an awakening taking place in your country like the awakening we're having here?
[01:03:37.853 --> 01:03:38.554]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:03:38.975 --> 01:03:43.882]  As a matter of fact, a couple of blokes down here, they got their own land, and they seceded from the actual country.
[01:03:45.324 --> 01:03:48.710]  I tell you what, I got a guest coming on from England, but just stay there.

[01:06:42.907 --> 01:06:44.287]  We've got Penn Dunn from Ireland.
[01:07:09.742 --> 01:07:24.912]  Joining us with his news site, BreakForNews.com, talk about some developments and things they've ferreted out concerning the 9-11 whitewash commission and intimidation and the government trying to falsify 9-11 documents, intimidating witnesses, you name it.
[01:07:25.293 --> 01:07:32.638]  But real quick, Ted, in Australia, finishing up, you're saying part of the country or an area broke off?
[01:07:32.818 --> 01:07:34.439]  Can you tell us more about that?
[01:07:35.307 --> 01:07:38.568]  Yeah, well, it's not a big part.
[01:07:38.848 --> 01:07:43.349]  See, what happens is here under English law, you can actually secede.
[01:07:43.389 --> 01:07:50.892]  Say, for example, if you've got two, three hundred acres, that sort of thing, you can actually turn around and secede from the actual country itself.
[01:07:51.612 --> 01:07:58.734]  Now, there's one in Western Australia, and he turned himself into a prince, and he's probably got about 20,000 acres, and he decides
[01:08:03.419 --> 01:08:16.185]  And he decided, well we've got a big country down here, and he decided he didn't want to be a part of the Australian government anymore, so he basically seceded and he just called them, you know, new world order puppets.
[01:08:16.825 --> 01:08:17.245]  Which they are.
[01:08:17.285 --> 01:08:24.789]  Well I know there's a lot of states that have in their constitution the right to revolt, the right to secede, not just the state, but counties.
[01:08:25.649 --> 01:08:26.890]  And the week before 9-11,
[01:08:28.523 --> 01:08:32.466]  New Hampshire and several other states had a whole bunch of counties getting together.
[01:08:33.567 --> 01:08:36.949]  The polls were showing they were going to secede from the state and the U.S.
[01:08:37.469 --> 01:08:42.672]  And I even had county commissioners and city council, they call them select men, on the show.
[01:08:42.712 --> 01:08:43.893]  This was really happening!
[01:08:44.474 --> 01:08:46.355]  But oh, that didn't happen after 9-11.
[01:08:46.375 --> 01:08:48.756]  We all had to team up to fight Al Ziaida.
[01:08:49.177 --> 01:08:50.257]  Hey, good to hear from you, Ted.
[01:08:51.158 --> 01:08:52.039]  I appreciate the call.
[01:08:52.059 --> 01:08:52.599]  That's interesting.
[01:08:53.451 --> 01:08:54.292]  from Australia.
[01:08:54.732 --> 01:08:59.354]  Mary and Harry and many, many others that are holding will get to your calls.
[01:08:59.454 --> 01:09:00.675]  There's a bunch of news here.
[01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:06.918]  Plans to cancel elections after terror attacks, that's the Associated Press, here in the United States.
[01:09:07.078 --> 01:09:08.398]  A bunch of Big Brother news.
[01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:13.581]  But joining us is a gentleman we had on a few months ago, Fenton Dunn.
[01:09:15.382 --> 01:09:18.363]  And Fenton, joining us from Ireland, good to have you on my friend.
[01:09:18.703 --> 01:09:20.264]  Yeah, nice to be back Alex, how are you?
[01:09:20.896 --> 01:09:21.757]  Great!
[01:09:22.237 --> 01:09:43.014]  I got several articles from your website, Break for News, but just for those that just joined us and don't know who Sybil Edmonds is, and don't know about the 9-11 Commission appointed by Bush, or don't know the details, or what happened with Sybil Edmonds, in a nutshell, tell them, bring them up to speed on her story, and then let's get into the latest developments, some of the stuff you've ferreted out.
[01:09:43.786 --> 01:09:52.149]  Okay, well, Sabelle Edmonds was a translator hired by the FBI, by their Intelligence Translation Department, not long after 9-11.
[01:09:52.469 --> 01:09:59.592]  Most people would be aware that there was a shortage, allegedly, of translators, so they hadn't translated valuable intelligence.
[01:09:59.652 --> 01:10:00.932]  She joined at that time.
[01:10:01.773 --> 01:10:10.076]  And then the story broke in public on March 24th of this year, when Sabelle Edmonds came out in public,
[01:10:10.649 --> 01:10:20.316]  And made accusations about wrongdoing by the FBI, which she had, for the past two years almost, been slowly bringing up the chain of command.
[01:10:20.957 --> 01:10:32.625]  What she said was that, in essence, the FBI's Intelligence Translation Department had been penetrated by a semi-legitimate network, semi-legitimate intelligence network.
[01:10:32.725 --> 01:10:36.148]  Not a foreign government, but one which had a semi-legitimate front.
[01:10:36.838 --> 01:10:46.846]  And that that intelligence network operated inside the FBI, cleaning the intelligence information as they translated it to make sure that it was sanitized.
[01:10:48.027 --> 01:10:52.170]  And that she was actually attempted to be recruited as part of this network.
[01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:59.195]  She reported that recruitment attempt to her superiors, took no action, told her to go away, told her to forget about it.
[01:10:59.625 --> 01:11:01.146]  She reported it to her superiors.
[01:11:01.226 --> 01:11:02.767]  Superiors, they told her the same.
[01:11:02.827 --> 01:11:03.807]  She went all the way up.
[01:11:03.827 --> 01:11:05.068]  She went to the Inspector General.
[01:11:05.408 --> 01:11:07.329]  She went to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[01:11:07.349 --> 01:11:08.890]  She went to the 9-11 Commission.
[01:11:09.571 --> 01:11:13.013]  She told them all about this highly critical penetration.
[01:11:13.253 --> 01:11:25.560]  She thought that they would do something, and then suddenly, after she goes to the Commission, which is another clean-up organization at a higher level, suddenly Ashcroft calls and says, hey, you want a better job?
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:25.980]  We'll do it.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.381]  If you don't shut up, you get arrested.
[01:11:28.081 --> 01:11:28.481]  That's right.
[01:11:29.778 --> 01:11:46.549]  What he did was, as she put this evidence before the committees involved, there was one briefing in particular, which was when the FBI showed up at the Senate Judiciary Committee, and they said, yeah, she did work for us, yeah, we are investigating these matters, yeah, there was certain intelligence which was involved.
[01:11:47.168 --> 01:11:48.369]  The rest of that we don't know.
[01:11:48.809 --> 01:11:58.176]  And now the reason she went public a few months ago is because she thought the commission was actually real and would do something, and people have asked, well, why do they have a commission, you know, and Bush doesn't want this coming out?
[01:11:58.216 --> 01:12:14.268]  Well, he appoints the commission, then they act as a way to suck up all the knowledge, all the data, and when agents come to them and go, I've got this information on 9-11, they say, okay, well, bye-bye, don't have an automobile accident and die tomorrow, have a good day, or, oh, you know, that
[01:12:15.603 --> 01:12:17.043]  You had a heart attack, didn't you?
[01:12:17.523 --> 01:12:20.744]  Or they can come and discredit or tell people to shut up or whatever.
[01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:31.026]  So that's what it acts as at one level and also so people think that, oh, the government's transparent and the 9-11 Commission criticizes a few things, you know, like WWF stage wrestling.
[01:12:32.186 --> 01:12:32.386]  Yeah.
[01:12:32.806 --> 01:12:41.808]  So she quickly, you know, she realized as she went along with this process and eventually she finally reached the limit of what she was prepared to do and just stay quiet and gave a press conference 24th of March this year.
[01:12:43.249 --> 01:12:47.393]  And that was when the scope of these allegations began to come out, but in a very limited way.
[01:12:47.453 --> 01:12:50.615]  She's been reported on by CBS 60 Minutes.
[01:12:50.695 --> 01:12:54.498]  So there's a lot of weight starting to come behind her allegations.
[01:12:54.979 --> 01:12:55.799]  And they are critical.
[01:12:55.819 --> 01:12:58.221]  Just to put this in perspective for people, what does this mean?
[01:12:58.662 --> 01:13:09.911]  This means at the very heart of the FBI's translation service, monitoring foreign intelligence, she found extra-national intelligence networks, crime-linked,
[01:13:10.467 --> 01:13:19.110]  She says that these networks, not only are they involved in the 9-11 plot, they're also involved in international drug trafficking and money laundering.
[01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:28.933]  And she says that investigations post 9-11, after the event, certain investigations that touched on these networks were quashed by order of the State Department.
[01:13:29.053 --> 01:13:38.296]  Now again, for folks to understand this, at the top of your intelligence agencies, your FBI, your security services, globally it's all really Interpol.
[01:13:38.356 --> 01:13:39.376]  It's international.
[01:13:40.263 --> 01:13:44.046]  And the only drug dealers that get busted are those that don't pay their cut.
[01:13:44.526 --> 01:13:49.149]  The only child kidnapping rings that get busted are those that aren't sanctioned and part of the UN.
[01:13:49.169 --> 01:13:53.092]  And again, we've seen this literally hundreds and hundreds of times.
[01:13:53.532 --> 01:13:56.074]  And so civil admins, and this has all been detailed, this is admitted.
[01:13:56.754 --> 01:13:59.476]  Mainstream, but it's, you know, back of the paper, you never really hear about it.
[01:14:00.552 --> 01:14:02.132]  They didn't have her doing new intelligence.
[01:14:02.152 --> 01:14:08.374]  They had her going back to the old intercepts, where they knew about the plans for the hijackings and the attacks.
[01:14:08.474 --> 01:14:13.196]  And they had her falsifying it and changing the record.
[01:14:14.256 --> 01:14:18.037]  And she thought, oh, this crime network telling me to do this, this is just some small group.
[01:14:18.417 --> 01:14:21.418]  Then she found out that it was sanctioned from the top.
[01:14:21.478 --> 01:14:23.619]  And you've got some of these new developments.
[01:14:24.019 --> 01:14:25.019]  Let's go over this, Fenton.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.903]  Okay, so when that story broke, a couple of things happened.
[01:14:29.203 --> 01:14:34.128]  The most important, I think, strategically was the Motley Rice legal team got to hear of this.
[01:14:34.488 --> 01:14:38.131]  They're the people who are prosecuting a case against various Saudi interests.
[01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:45.438]  And Ron Motley is a guy who took on the tobacco companies and he also took on Medicaid suits all around the USA.
[01:14:45.778 --> 01:14:47.600]  These are serious legal heavyweights.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:52.184]  And they immediately subpoenaed her information because it was an absolute goldmine for their case.
[01:14:53.067 --> 01:15:04.571]  Uh, the moment they did that, Ashcroft was straight into court, Judge Reggie Walton, who is handling Sabelle Edmonds unfair dismissals claim against the FBI, and said, I want you to cover this as state secret.
[01:15:04.991 --> 01:15:10.473]  In fact, I'm retrospectively covering her testimony to those Senate committees as state secret also.
[01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:13.334]  And, uh, we just want to hear no more about this.
[01:15:13.434 --> 01:15:15.375]  And they made a case to Reggie Walton on that basis.
[01:15:15.795 --> 01:15:18.776]  They want to shut that information out of the Motley Rice legal suit.
[01:15:20.121 --> 01:15:24.385]  Since then, the Project on Government Oversight has weighed in on the case as well.
[01:15:24.805 --> 01:15:29.668]  They're saying that those kinds of actions inhibit their ability to provide oversight of the FBI.
[01:15:29.708 --> 01:15:47.482]  Well, I mean, since the National Security Act of 1947, every drug dealing, every, you know, scam, every bid rigging, every bilking, a trillion, too, missing from the Pentagon in the last eight years under Bush and Clinton, a trillion, two hundred billion, and every time you try to investigate, they go, National Security, shut up!
[01:15:47.922 --> 01:15:52.886]  I mean, this is a license to steal, Rob, and now these rulers want to make us their slaves.
[01:15:53.186 --> 01:15:56.809]  You see, folks, you can't put up with corruption, or it just grows and grows and grows.
[01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:59.471]  Now, she got threatened by Ashcroft, did she not?
[01:16:00.532 --> 01:16:04.214]  Well, she's been threatened that if she speaks about these matters, she would immediately be arrested.
[01:16:04.494 --> 01:16:06.056]  So that's the scope of the order.
[01:16:06.456 --> 01:16:14.362]  Now, FBI agent Robert Wright cried on C-SPAN and said, look, all I can tell you is the Bushes, vacation with the Bin Ladens,
[01:16:15.402 --> 01:16:22.645]  Here's the letter, I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know, but why is Kathleen Rowley, the whitewashing FBI agent, again a shill?
[01:16:23.085 --> 01:16:27.847]  Oh, this is who blew the whistle, and then they divert off to her, the head of the council in Minneapolis-St.
[01:16:27.867 --> 01:16:32.989]  Paul, and then she puts out some whitewash, but we need more funding, just give us more power, we'll keep you safe.
[01:16:33.349 --> 01:16:37.771]  Meanwhile, the real FBI agents that try to stop 9-11, they're crying, crying!
[01:16:38.351 --> 01:16:42.914]  A big ol' six foot three man, holding up where they'll be arrested if they tell us what they know.
[01:16:43.194 --> 01:16:45.956]  I mean, so, so, this is happening not just with civil admins.
[01:16:46.696 --> 01:16:47.997]  Yeah, it's happening across the board.
[01:16:48.157 --> 01:17:00.024]  And in fact, Sabelle's early, you know, the aspect of it which was threatening was that when she began to realize that there was this intelligence network operating inside the FBI, they tried to recruit her.
[01:17:00.465 --> 01:17:07.209]  And when she wouldn't go along with that, they said to her, well, why would you want to put your family in harm's way by not going along with this, by not playing ball?
[01:17:07.611 --> 01:17:10.873]  And the FBI then offered her a job as a full FBI agent.
[01:17:12.414 --> 01:17:14.276]  They offered her double the money!
[01:17:15.817 --> 01:17:18.739]  They also confiscated her computer and they put her through a polygraph test.
[01:17:19.279 --> 01:17:27.825]  But she's a determined lady and she's pressed on with this matter and now she's taken it to the point where it's been necessary for them to deploy John Ashcroft against her to shut her up.
[01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:30.727]  And you gave us her phone number.
[01:17:30.847 --> 01:17:35.190]  We've tried, it's been hard, but we're going to be getting her on and you've interviewed her, you've talked to her.
[01:17:35.876 --> 01:17:36.537]  I've talked to her.
[01:17:36.557 --> 01:17:38.398]  She's a very gutsy lady.
[01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:40.400]  Do you have one of those interviews on your website?
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.221]  I do, yeah.
[01:17:41.261 --> 01:17:42.502]  We've got audio of it.
[01:17:42.562 --> 01:17:43.222]  Hey, I'll tell you what.
[01:17:43.262 --> 01:17:53.551]  During the break, will you direct the person running the show where to find that at your Break for News website so we can play that on air?
[01:17:53.911 --> 01:17:54.191]  Okay.
[01:17:54.472 --> 01:17:55.332]  Yep.
[01:17:55.352 --> 01:17:59.256]  So just direct them to which little piece you want us to play and we'll do that.
[01:17:59.296 --> 01:18:00.196]  You do a lot of great work.
[01:18:00.236 --> 01:18:00.977]  We're honored to have you.
[01:18:01.337 --> 01:18:03.299]  What other things will we be talking about when we get back?
[01:18:04.409 --> 01:18:10.491]  Well, the developments in this indicate that we have to start looking at these drug networks because they are key.
[01:18:10.871 --> 01:18:25.695]  While we've been diverted into this sideshow stuff about what did Mohammed Atta say to the passengers routine, we've been diverted away from the one person that the government has actually moved to state secret shut up in case of 9-11.
[01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:27.575]  So let's look at what she's talking about.
[01:18:27.635 --> 01:18:29.476]  Let's look at these drug networks.
[01:18:30.538 --> 01:18:31.258]  Let's do that.
[01:18:32.119 --> 01:18:32.919]  Stay there, Fenton.
[01:18:32.939 --> 01:18:33.439]  We'll be back.
[01:18:33.539 --> 01:18:36.541]  And your calls are coming up as well at 800-259-9231.
[01:18:36.561 --> 01:18:41.643]  My website's PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:46.285]  His fine news organization is BreakForNews.com.
[01:18:46.545 --> 01:18:46.945]  We'll be back.
[01:18:53.231 --> 01:18:56.493]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:18:56.553 --> 01:19:00.735]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:19:00.995 --> 01:19:03.776]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:19:03.976 --> 01:19:06.357]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:19:06.557 --> 01:19:15.201]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:19:15.401 --> 01:19:16.742]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[01:19:16.942 --> 01:19:21.084]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:19:21.084 --> 01:19:21.744]  We're good to go!
[01:19:51.164 --> 01:19:52.887]  I don't think so.
[01:20:07.628 --> 01:20:11.511]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:20:11.631 --> 01:20:12.072]  Fragrance?
[01:20:12.452 --> 01:20:17.216]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:20:17.336 --> 01:20:22.020]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:24.803]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:28.486]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:20:28.646 --> 01:20:32.149]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:34.712]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:20:34.892 --> 01:20:35.773]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:20:35.893 --> 01:20:45.665]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Calden Pure Soaps.

[01:20:53.928 --> 01:20:56.129]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:56.569 --> 01:21:00.911]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:01.191 --> 01:21:06.994]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:07.234 --> 01:21:11.275]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:11.576 --> 01:21:17.218]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:21:17.318 --> 01:21:19.939]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.941]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:28.361]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:21:28.701 --> 01:21:31.002]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:21:31.382 --> 01:21:35.002]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:21:35.482 --> 01:21:41.663]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:21:42.124 --> 01:21:43.104]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:21:43.464 --> 01:21:43.804]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:43.824 --> 01:21:44.064]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.307 --> 01:22:03.454]  The day began with a civil service... ...to rescue of the hostages you have... ...is headed for... ...to the war on terror until they are credited... Senator, not getting all the news that's fit to print due to mainstream press censors?

[01:22:58.006 --> 01:22:59.927]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.407 --> 01:23:03.249]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:07.491 --> 01:23:14.674]  Alright, coming up, we're going to play an eight minute interview, a segment of an interview that Penton Dunn did with the civil admins.
[01:23:14.834 --> 01:23:16.575]  We're going to take your calls, everybody be patient.
[01:23:17.466 --> 01:23:20.408]  We've had Fenton on before, we can talk about any of the New World Order issues.
[01:23:22.589 --> 01:23:35.516]  Continuing with these cleaner crews in the FBI, in the government, protected from the highest levels, how did she begin to learn about how they're protecting these drug trafficking networks?
[01:23:36.576 --> 01:23:43.000]  Well, she's had sight of the relevant intelligence material because she's worked in there with a high security clearance
[01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:46.260]  So she became aware of a broad scope of investigations.
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:52.903]  She says there were also an investigation running in the FBI from 1998, which is prior to the Bush administration.
[01:23:53.443 --> 01:23:56.164]  And that investigation also was run into the sand.
[01:23:57.045 --> 01:24:03.867]  But it was hands-on intervention by the State Department that she was aware of, and she knew the material they were trying to intervene on.
[01:24:04.728 --> 01:24:10.290]  They intervened on the basis that that would affect relations with foreign corporations and or foreign interests.
[01:24:11.269 --> 01:24:19.495]  And she says that those corporations, those individuals, those money trails lead back into an international drug smuggling network.
[01:24:20.496 --> 01:24:21.877]  She says this is beyond countries.
[01:24:22.997 --> 01:24:29.882]  In fact, she says you've got to start thinking not in terms of countries anymore, as to did the Israelis do this?
[01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:32.604]  Did the Iranians do this?
[01:24:32.684 --> 01:24:34.886]  She says that this is operating extra-national.
[01:24:35.850 --> 01:24:48.099]  Well, I mean, that's the very nature of the New World Order, is they have all the top people in most of the big intelligence agencies, and they're nothing but organized criminals running their organized crime syndicates, using government to go after their competition.
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:49.480]  Exactly.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:50.180]  Exactly.
[01:24:50.241 --> 01:25:00.728]  So, she says that the certain points where you have, quoting her now, drug-related activities combined with money laundering and information laundering,
[01:25:01.141 --> 01:25:03.302]  Converging with your terrorist activity.
[01:25:03.522 --> 01:25:20.008]  And I've said this many times that it's chilling that much of the Total Information Awareness Network and the NSA and Echelon and the Matrix System is about protecting their operations and finding out when low-level law enforcement learns of them to kill those investigations.
[01:25:20.588 --> 01:25:21.048]  Absolutely.
[01:25:21.068 --> 01:25:22.989]  That's essential in terms of running these things.
[01:25:23.009 --> 01:25:25.150]  You've got to stop them before they really get off the ground.
[01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:29.371]  Yeah, so most of the surveillance, folks, isn't about making sure you're not committing a crime.
[01:25:29.812 --> 01:25:30.332]  No, no, no, no.
[01:25:31.132 --> 01:25:38.915]  It's about busting a few patsies so you think the government's doing something, while meanwhile protecting all of their real criminal operations.
[01:25:39.695 --> 01:25:39.875]  Yeah.
[01:25:40.395 --> 01:25:49.559]  So she says that this intelligence network that you're talking about there, it's gathered by certain semi-legitimate organizations... In fact, let's just call it the Illuminati.
[01:25:49.999 --> 01:25:50.179]  Right.
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.061]  It really doesn't boil down to countries anymore.
[01:25:53.141 --> 01:25:57.883]  Quoting, when you have activities involving a lot of money, you have people from different nations involved.
[01:25:58.223 --> 01:26:02.085]  It can be categorized under organized crime, but in a very large scale.
[01:26:03.226 --> 01:26:05.587]  And that's what she's saying is connected to 9-11.
[01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:11.490]  Organized crime, drugs, and money, and information trafficking networks on a very large scale.
[01:26:12.331 --> 01:26:13.793]  I mean, this is what we want!
[01:26:13.873 --> 01:26:27.165]  Well, that's what Dr. Tanya Kovashnia, one of Putin's chief economic advisors, months before said the Deadhead Group, transferred from Russia, the Skull and Bones Group, will attack the center of the financial order.
[01:26:27.445 --> 01:26:32.170]  This $300 trillion group wants to bring in this world crisis.
[01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:33.111]  Yeah.
[01:26:33.731 --> 01:26:37.755]  So, if you were to summarize it, and looking at this political theater playing out in Iran,
[01:26:38.157 --> 01:26:46.904]  And looking at the move into Afghanistan and the 380% increase in the heroin crop over there, you're talking about Iran-Contra reloaded.
[01:26:47.385 --> 01:26:48.446]  This is what this is.
[01:26:49.186 --> 01:26:53.570]  The boys are back in town, the Contra boys are back in town, and this time they're doing it big.
[01:26:55.592 --> 01:27:00.856]  This is now, not just South America, but this is now, you've got the Colombians moving into Eastern Europe.
[01:27:02.758 --> 01:27:05.580]  Moving into that zone where the KLA controls.
[01:27:06.013 --> 01:27:12.435]  And you've also got these drug networks now reactivated, freshly loaded with massive amounts of heroin.
[01:27:12.455 --> 01:27:25.680]  Well, that's like in 98 when they used Al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs, and then they have the radical Muslims running Albania through Iran, and it's just absolutely unbelievable, time and time again, you turn over Iraq, it's these same people.
[01:27:26.401 --> 01:27:26.621]  Yeah.
[01:27:27.161 --> 01:27:32.363]  Now, the interesting thing for me is that, in terms of what she's talking about there, and from the work that Dan Hofsteker has done,
[01:27:33.541 --> 01:27:42.043]  It doesn't seem to me as if in terms of putting the people on the ground, the patsies, the so-called hijackers, they did not use clean intelligence networks for that.
[01:27:42.383 --> 01:27:45.344]  I'm very surprised that they're so sloppy on that issue.
[01:27:45.404 --> 01:27:48.025]  I would have used a very clean network to put those people in.
[01:27:48.345 --> 01:27:54.166]  It seems like they used the same old drug trafficking, money laundering networks that they were using for all the other ops.
[01:27:54.546 --> 01:27:58.307]  But see, that gives them a membrane of plausible deniability
[01:27:59.764 --> 01:28:01.525]  It does, but it also gives... there's no cut out.
[01:28:01.605 --> 01:28:10.949]  Had they used a clean operation, run out of Europe, say, to put those people in, they would have no possible links, whereas now I think the bell is fingering some of the links that could be very useful.
[01:28:11.029 --> 01:28:16.432]  But it's hard for them in the regular intelligence agencies to find enough evil sociopaths to carry it out then.
[01:28:16.872 --> 01:28:17.632]  That's a very good point.
[01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:21.874]  That's the only reason they don't have us in camps.
[01:28:21.954 --> 01:28:23.775]  It's the logistical issue, yeah, I agree.
[01:28:24.075 --> 01:28:26.276]  That's the only reason we're not in camps right now, okay?
[01:28:27.512 --> 01:28:30.435]  I mean, if they had the people to carry out the pure evil, they'd do it, my friend.
[01:28:30.455 --> 01:28:31.596]  That's why they use pure criminals.
[01:28:32.317 --> 01:28:32.877]  Great points.
[01:28:32.917 --> 01:28:33.878]  Fenton Dunne, this is riveting.
[01:28:34.159 --> 01:28:34.559]  Stay with us.
[01:28:34.579 --> 01:28:35.380]  We'll talk more about it.
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.741]  Play a clip from your radio show.
[01:28:37.302 --> 01:28:38.143]  And take calls.
[01:28:38.183 --> 01:28:38.743]  Stay with us.
[01:28:39.404 --> 01:28:41.426]  We're gonna keep Fenton into the next hour if you can stay with us.
[01:28:43.688 --> 01:28:44.609]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.090 --> 01:28:46.691]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.612 --> 01:28:50.275]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.277 --> 01:28:54.978]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:28:55.058 --> 01:28:57.560]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:58.440]  It feels great.
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:28:59.661]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:28:59.741 --> 01:29:05.284]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:29:05.584 --> 01:29:07.125]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[01:29:07.366 --> 01:29:09.747]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:29:09.887 --> 01:29:12.989]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:29:13.169 --> 01:29:13.850]  Incredible.
[01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:15.272]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:29:15.312 --> 01:29:19.016]  I'm a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:29:19.116 --> 01:29:19.897]  Well, that's for sure.
[01:29:20.077 --> 01:29:20.638]  Was it easy?
[01:29:20.878 --> 01:29:21.479]  Very easy.
[01:29:21.519 --> 01:29:22.400]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:27.606]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[01:29:28.086 --> 01:29:34.092]  No, you can lose fat the safe and healthy way, just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:29:34.432 --> 01:29:35.533]  Call right now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:29:35.593 --> 01:29:35.974]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:29:35.994 --> 01:29:40.358]  Remember, mention you heard it right here, and that gets you $25 off a three month supply.
[01:29:40.558 --> 01:29:41.879]  So call Vim and Vigor today, 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:29:41.899 --> 01:29:42.280]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:29:53.576 --> 01:29:56.580]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:29:56.921 --> 01:30:05.732]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[01:30:06.073 --> 01:30:10.739]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:11.199 --> 01:30:17.927]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:18.328 --> 01:30:30.122]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:30.582 --> 01:30:35.047]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:30:35.207 --> 01:30:37.669]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:54.067 --> 01:30:55.068]  Spring has arrived!
[01:30:55.248 --> 01:30:58.208]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:58.428 --> 01:31:01.889]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:02.089 --> 01:31:10.251]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:33:29.742 --> 01:33:31.303]  I've made two films on 9-11.
[01:33:31.323 --> 01:33:33.444]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and The Masters of Terror.
[01:33:33.804 --> 01:33:34.764]  Both of them are excellent.
[01:33:35.145 --> 01:33:36.685]  I carry two other videos on 9-11.
[01:33:36.985 --> 01:33:41.868]  Eric Huffman's video, and that is a 9-11 Painful Deceptions.
[01:33:42.448 --> 01:33:44.669]  He also has a book, Painful Questions, that we offer.
[01:33:45.541 --> 01:33:52.111]  George Humphrey's brand new video, just out for a few weeks, is 9-11, The Great Illusion, endgame of the Illuminati.

[01:34:34.551 --> 01:34:38.433]  That's 888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:34:50.556 --> 01:34:56.459]  Going back to Fenton Dunn from BreakForNews.com, Fenton, I'll try to quit jumping in.
[01:34:56.479 --> 01:35:01.822]  Just everything Sybil Evans and you were saying makes total sense from what I've seen from a decade of research.
[01:35:02.583 --> 01:35:08.086]  This is an organized crime syndicate controlling the government and they use criminals to carry out their aims.
[01:35:08.526 --> 01:35:13.869]  But continuing with the revelations of this cleaner crew in the FBI that was trying to recruit her,
[01:35:14.969 --> 01:35:21.631]  First, to cover up 9-11 prior knowledge information, to falsify transcripts, but then, what else did she discover, Fenton?
[01:35:22.412 --> 01:35:28.834]  Well, she found that there had been these interventions by the State Department into post-9-11 investigations.
[01:35:29.414 --> 01:35:35.056]  So, following 9-11, they were following certain lines of inquiry, and those lines of inquiry were closed down by the State Department.
[01:35:35.576 --> 01:35:38.997]  Now, there's only one kind of inquiry the State Department would want to close down.
[01:35:39.037 --> 01:35:42.698]  That was inquiries which were actually leading somewhere, which were taking us into this network.
[01:35:43.433 --> 01:35:45.995]  And I believe it's a vulnerability in the 9-11 plot.
[01:35:46.815 --> 01:35:48.897]  And it's one that we need to focus on a lot more.
[01:35:49.637 --> 01:35:53.320]  Dan Hofstaker, in a critique of 9-11 issues, has made this point.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.462]  He says, I can't take peak oil to court.
[01:35:55.482 --> 01:36:01.126]  You know, he says, I can't take the steel that fell the wrong way on 9-11 to court.
[01:36:01.566 --> 01:36:05.409]  But I sure have got people down here in Florida who are very suspicious.
[01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:07.030]  He wants us to follow
[01:36:07.731 --> 01:36:08.692]  He wants fingerprints.
[01:36:08.772 --> 01:36:09.853]  He wants people.
[01:36:09.913 --> 01:36:11.655]  He wants places, dates, times.
[01:36:11.695 --> 01:36:17.181]  He wants us to go after the 9-11 story by digging in Florida and finding out what was going on down there.
[01:36:17.822 --> 01:36:23.928]  And I think that what Sabel Edmonds has been pointing us towards is valuable information that takes us in the right direction.
[01:36:24.348 --> 01:36:25.830]  Who were the cleaner crews working for?
[01:36:26.250 --> 01:36:27.812]  What kind of information were they cleaning?
[01:36:28.450 --> 01:36:39.293]  This was the sort of material that should have been the center point of any proper investigation, and yet the 9-11 Commission has taken testimony, buried it, and John Ashcroft is rendering her information as a state secret.
[01:36:39.953 --> 01:36:41.374]  So we've got to follow that information.
[01:36:43.974 --> 01:36:49.276]  All right, now, now, Fenton, what other pressure or harassment has she been under?
[01:36:50.336 --> 01:36:53.397]  Well, she was put through the full intimidation tactic.
[01:36:54.177 --> 01:36:57.158]  They gave her a polygraph, which she decided to take and which she passed.
[01:36:57.674 --> 01:36:58.214]  And now Ashcroft
[01:37:22.923 --> 01:37:32.370]  It's been, again, even in Reuters and the Associated Press, told her, he said, that we'll charge you if you go public with classified information.
[01:37:33.150 --> 01:37:33.871]  Yes, yes.
[01:37:34.131 --> 01:37:37.954]  And then on top of this, she says that she's been followed and harassed.
[01:37:38.294 --> 01:37:40.136]  How has she been followed and harassed?
[01:37:41.057 --> 01:37:49.243]  Well, she believes she's been followed and harassed by elements of this criminal intelligence network, and also by legitimate government surveillance.
[01:37:50.736 --> 01:38:08.507]  Nevertheless it doesn't seem to have dissuaded her and I think we've passed the point where you can interfere with what she's doing because as I said the most critical development I feel yes it's useful to have the project on government oversight taking the case but the real meat is the Motley Rice legal team.
[01:38:09.007 --> 01:38:19.334]  These are hot legal operators and they've submitted last week to the judge Reggie Walton a list of 31 questions they want answers to in relation to their case against Saudi interests.
[01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:23.670]  There are very specific questions about the kind of information which she gave behind closed doors.
[01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:28.923]  And again, by getting at the Saudis, you get at this whole Carlisle Group crime access.
[01:38:29.708 --> 01:38:39.414]  And at the same time, if Sybil Edmonds would have kept creeping around in the shadows, she would have died in an automobile accident, or slipped and fell on the pavement, or had a heart attack.
[01:38:39.674 --> 01:38:46.018]  But once you're out, once you're public, once you've said what you have to say, that's one of the safest things you can do.
[01:38:46.318 --> 01:38:48.599]  And as a society, we should all do this.
[01:38:48.639 --> 01:38:52.861]  We should all stand up and get involved and say no, because there's more of us than there are of them.
[01:38:52.881 --> 01:38:57.944]  Yeah, I think it's essential for us to back Sybil Edmonds as much as we can, because
[01:38:59.675 --> 01:39:13.500]  If it puts pressures on the Saudis, I don't mind that at all, because the Saudis are feeling the pressure right now, and you just look at what they're saying, what Crown Prince Abdullah is saying, what the Saudi ambassador in London is saying, they're saying Zionists are behind the terrorism that's taking place in Saudi Arabia.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:20.062]  So they're publicly stating what we know to be the case, that it is Zionist-inspired terrorism.
[01:39:20.722 --> 01:39:27.044]  And they're saying that on TV networks in Saudi Arabia, and they're saying it in the international arena right now.
[01:39:27.543 --> 01:39:32.106]  So, I wonder if enough pressure is put on the Saudis, will we actually start to get some cracks in all this?
[01:39:32.707 --> 01:39:34.488]  Because they know they're going down.
[01:39:34.848 --> 01:39:37.130]  Okay, now, let's dissect what you just said.
[01:39:38.031 --> 01:39:53.262]  Because earlier you talked about how it's not one intelligence agency, it's Civil Levens saying it's not one group, even specifically said that it's not Israel, it's not England, it's not
[01:39:54.008 --> 01:40:01.853]  So, when you say Zionists behind terrorism in Saudi Arabia, I agree that in the Middle East, this global crime cartel
[01:40:02.668 --> 01:40:27.951]  does use israelis because they've got people that can double as arabs they know the ground they've been there before so i would agree with the new order carries out terror attacks in the middle east uh... they generally end up using israeli operatives but whereas if it's in england they'll use an MI6 or MI5 operative because they know the ground or if it's in america they'll use CIA or CIA criminal go-betweens
[01:40:28.631 --> 01:40:55.842]  And it's been in the Israeli papers, folks, in the Jerusalem Post and all these other places that they've created fake Al-Qaeda groups not to infiltrate but to carry out shootings and bombings every time there's about to be a peace deal to keep the war going so they can keep getting the aid and keep having the weapons and keep having the military industrial complex in Israel censoring the news and controlling that population.
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:59.964]  When we look at this, the Saudis have said, hey, back off.
[01:41:00.024 --> 01:41:07.954]  In fact, when they were going to release that report blaming the Saudis, and the 24 pages got held back, or 28 pages, the Saudis said, hey, look, we'll list the four U.S.
[01:41:08.014 --> 01:41:08.415]  banks
[01:41:09.233 --> 01:41:11.736]  That really own and run Saudi Arabia.
[01:41:12.076 --> 01:41:16.381]  We'll expose that it's Mossad and Shin Bet carrying out the bombings.
[01:41:16.581 --> 01:41:24.290]  And then a month ago, when they had the shooting at the Kobar city area, the USA told them, let Al-Qaeda go.
[01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:27.834]  And then we have the Nick Byrd case.
[01:41:28.614 --> 01:41:32.216]  Where he's getting his head cut off and he's connected to 9-11 hijackers.
[01:41:32.236 --> 01:41:34.277]  He's connected to State Department people.
[01:41:34.317 --> 01:41:37.759]  Connected to shipping illegal things out of Iraq.
[01:41:38.219 --> 01:41:39.740]  He's working at Abu Ghraib.
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:40.440]  He's in U.S.
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.061]  custody for 13 days.
[01:41:42.101 --> 01:41:46.023]  Then released into Al-Qaeda's hands and gets his head cut off.
[01:41:46.283 --> 01:41:49.945]  So when the Saudis start playing this brinksmanship, the Saudis have said,
[01:41:50.485 --> 01:41:51.926]  You're trying to destabilize us.
[01:41:51.986 --> 01:42:00.088]  You want radical Muslims to take over, to overthrow us, so you have an excuse to, quote, come to the rescue and take over Saudi Arabia as well.
[01:42:00.249 --> 01:42:00.989]  What do you say to that?
[01:42:01.529 --> 01:42:03.030]  Yeah, that's absolutely on the money.
[01:42:05.150 --> 01:42:10.112]  When you're talking about all this, you almost have to say first which zone you're speaking about.
[01:42:10.232 --> 01:42:13.353]  Is it the mainstream zone or is it the real news zone?
[01:42:13.833 --> 01:42:17.835]  Because the Saudis are speaking code language and they say Zionists are behind it.
[01:42:19.119 --> 01:42:35.162]  And they're aware of a current operation which has been run through the Fahrenheit 9-11 issue, which is to offload blame onto the Saudi Arabian link, but to do it at a very slim and just surface level.
[01:42:35.923 --> 01:42:38.505]  Talking about business connections and profiteering.
[01:42:38.525 --> 01:42:41.767]  Yeah, just psychologically, oh, it's an open secret.
[01:42:42.068 --> 01:42:42.688]  They did it.
[01:42:42.948 --> 01:42:43.929]  Psychologically.
[01:42:44.649 --> 01:42:50.313]  Fahrenheit 9-11 actually sets the standard that Bush wasn't involved and didn't have prior knowledge.
[01:42:50.353 --> 01:42:51.234]  He's just an idiot.
[01:42:51.714 --> 01:42:56.538]  Yeah, and it's blowback through our Saudi connections was how it happened.
[01:42:57.018 --> 01:42:58.279]  So the Saudis know that that is a
[01:42:58.895 --> 01:43:06.143]  Uh, in play as a gambit at the moment, and they're well aware that they've been squeezed by this so-called arcade of terrorism, so...
[01:43:07.502 --> 01:43:23.988]  So when you say Zionists, do you agree with me that when we talk about the Middle East, that the global crime syndicate above that, that's Germans, British, Jews, everybody working together, that they're simply using the Israelis as the clients because they know the ground?
[01:43:24.028 --> 01:43:26.969]  Because I don't believe it's Zionists that run the New World Order, do you?
[01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:28.150]  No, I don't.
[01:43:28.230 --> 01:43:31.251]  I think if you're looking at who runs, it's a corporate New World Order.
[01:43:31.841 --> 01:43:36.605]  And I find my strongest signals right now coming out of the G8 meeting which took place recently.
[01:43:37.025 --> 01:43:37.606]  Absolutely!
[01:43:37.646 --> 01:43:41.609]  It's the heads of the industrialized world and then the big private banks that own that.
[01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:46.573]  You look at the British Royalty, Dutch Royalty, Rockefellers, Rothschilds, these are the people.
[01:43:46.953 --> 01:43:47.133]  Yeah.
[01:43:47.593 --> 01:43:52.677]  So you have this fake game that got played out where France stood up to the USA, etc.
[01:43:52.717 --> 01:43:58.882]  But then, just prior to the G8 meeting, they all trooped together into the one room at the UN and they carved up Iraq together.
[01:43:59.363 --> 01:44:00.964]  Then they went down to the G8 meeting
[01:44:01.351 --> 01:44:04.416]  And they came out with a statement saying they were announcing a partnership.
[01:44:04.916 --> 01:44:08.482]  That's like when a guy moves into your territory and starts running a protection racket.
[01:44:08.602 --> 01:44:12.548]  Announcing a partnership with the broader Middle East and North Africa.
[01:44:13.427 --> 01:44:15.428]  Well, they're going to promote democracy.
[01:44:15.848 --> 01:44:32.655]  And democracy means puppet governments installed after the Imperials blast things to bits, installing martial law, and they're calling martial law on Iraq freedom, putting in Baathists doing all of this, invading the 63 countries, they've already gone into two of them now, actually three if you count the Gold Coast of Africa,
[01:44:33.715 --> 01:44:37.557]  And I said a year before the war, we're going to go in and play the part of the bad cop.
[01:44:37.897 --> 01:44:40.038]  That'll make the EU and the UN look like the good cop.
[01:44:40.278 --> 01:44:43.920]  They'll come in and take possession as the saviour and our troops will man it and run it.
[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:48.982]  Yeah, they're running bad cop, good cop on the world and on the Iraqis and on the American people.
[01:44:49.922 --> 01:44:57.906]  And there's no doubt that it's transparent, the GA genesis of this, announcing a partnership with the broader Middle East and North Africa.
[01:44:58.297 --> 01:45:03.140]  That betrays the whole lie to me, because what is the broader Middle East and North Africa?
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:04.080]  It's CENTCOM!
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:07.102]  Look at the map of what the borders of CENTCOM are.
[01:45:07.142 --> 01:45:10.063]  They run from North Africa through the broader Middle East up to Russia.
[01:45:10.083 --> 01:45:14.786]  So, the G8 countries went in, some of whom are supposedly against
[01:45:15.342 --> 01:45:20.483]  the American intervention in Iraq and signed up to a partnership deal with the CENTCOM military zone.
[01:45:20.523 --> 01:45:27.725]  Yeah, and the Russians were supposedly against it, but now Putin's going, oh yeah, they have weapons of mass destruction, and oh, I love the U.N.
[01:45:27.745 --> 01:45:29.086]  takeover, I love Bush.
[01:45:29.846 --> 01:45:36.368]  Yeah, and then you go back to 1917, where you talked about history repeating, and you listen to the proclamation which was made by F.S.
[01:45:37.008 --> 01:45:42.530]  Maude, Lieutenant General Commander of the British forces in Iraq, when 600,000 of them moved in and took over Iraq in 1917.
[01:45:42.570 --> 01:45:42.790]  He said,
[01:45:44.344 --> 01:45:49.228]  Our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as liberators.
[01:45:49.948 --> 01:45:58.715]  It is the wish not only of my king and his peoples, but also the wish of the great nations with whom he is in alliance, that you should prosper, even as in the past when your lands were fertile.
[01:45:59.135 --> 01:46:04.900]  It's the hope of the British government that the aspirations of your philosophers and writers shall be realized once again.
[01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:11.993]  That the people of Baghdad shall flourish and enjoy their wealth and substance under institutions in consonance with their sacred laws.
[01:46:12.353 --> 01:46:20.837]  And we're going to need, that is the globalists, a national draft to people the invasion armies of the 60 plus countries they want to invade.
[01:46:21.738 --> 01:46:32.223]  Yeah, that whole zone there has got far too much natural resources and the determination is that those people in those zones are going to be kept on the fringes of the stone age until such time as
[01:46:32.748 --> 01:46:34.749]  The globalists are in full control of their countries.
[01:46:34.889 --> 01:46:41.051]  And that's what the New World Order is about, is not allowing any quote, rogue nation, whether it's run by a good person or a bad person, that doesn't matter.
[01:46:41.312 --> 01:46:47.094]  Don't let any rogue country develop technologically, because the globalists have to have a monopoly of technology.
[01:46:47.314 --> 01:46:54.077]  So two different technological levels, while domestically, within the western world, bringing down our standard of living and getting rid of the middle class.
[01:46:54.801 --> 01:47:01.588]  Yeah, so there's radically different behaviour mechanisms when they moved into Serbia compared to moving into Iraq.
[01:47:01.908 --> 01:47:07.574]  Moving into Serbia, low level damage, easy infiltration and takeover by the corporates.
[01:47:07.774 --> 01:47:10.056]  However, the policy for Iraq is total destruction.
[01:47:10.136 --> 01:47:12.539]  No, they don't want those countries growing at all.
[01:47:13.314 --> 01:47:26.225]  Well, it's really a genocide program, forcing the vaccines on them, perpetual war, martial law, a huge meat grinder for our troops, where they make hundreds of millions of dollars a year for, you know, Halliburton and others, and no-bid contracts.
[01:47:26.485 --> 01:47:28.547]  It's not meant to be won, it's meant to go on and on.
[01:47:29.207 --> 01:47:34.732]  Yeah, and General Charles F. Wald just gave a talk, and he said that
[01:47:35.277 --> 01:47:38.940]  Africa was a breeding ground for terrorism which would have to be tackled.
[01:47:40.362 --> 01:47:45.866]  And that helps keep the diamond monopoly in place where the Oppenheimers have been losing control.
[01:47:45.886 --> 01:47:52.252]  I remember five years ago they said we're going to claim there's terrorism in the west coast of Africa and we're going to invade.
[01:47:52.492 --> 01:47:53.773]  That was in the New Yorker magazine.
[01:47:53.793 --> 01:47:54.734]  They even brag about it.
[01:47:55.715 --> 01:48:02.741]  Yeah, well the links are even there between the recently appointed security group from the United Kingdom
[01:48:03.423 --> 01:48:09.428]  There's links there which lead right into the people who are planning the coup in Africa, in Sierra Leone.
[01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:12.150]  So, the same M.O.
[01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:31.965]  every time, it's about natural resources, but I think the chilling thing, Alex, about this for me is that looking at their actual tactics, they plan genocidal programs for the whole of the broader Middle East zone and also for Africa, because if there's too many people around, well, let it be the black ones and the Arabs be the ones to bear the brunt of the depopulation.
[01:48:32.868 --> 01:48:37.450]  Which is what Prince Philip and Ted Turner and everybody else in the UN have said is the plan.
[01:48:37.891 --> 01:48:38.071]  Yeah.
[01:48:38.451 --> 01:48:39.672]  Those guys are elected.
[01:48:39.732 --> 01:48:41.773]  They're surplus to requirements.
[01:48:41.913 --> 01:48:44.794]  Those lands there are more valuable in terms of natural resources.
[01:48:45.174 --> 01:48:49.737]  And if they get their act together and develop as countries, they'll only use those natural resources for their own people.
[01:48:49.857 --> 01:48:50.797]  Which, of course, is their right.
[01:48:51.758 --> 01:48:52.218]  But no.
[01:48:52.458 --> 01:48:58.381]  But instead, we can have a global monopoly over those in the globalist hands, and they can gouge all of us for those resources.
[01:48:58.982 --> 01:48:59.182]  Yeah.
[01:48:59.682 --> 01:49:01.643]  If you don't have a monopoly, prices will fall.
[01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:14.955]  Well, with that in train, it is interesting that despite the high-level support which they have for those operations, that they have to get down and dirty in the drug network to actually do implementation work.
[01:49:15.355 --> 01:49:17.456]  Well, that's the good news is they don't have enough henchmen.
[01:49:17.656 --> 01:49:24.599]  That's why they're on TV every night saying torture is good, and all the fiction TV shows promote torture and secret arrest.
[01:49:24.899 --> 01:49:27.380]  They have to train their millions that all of this is normal.
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:31.062]  They have to somehow mutate the minds of enough people to carry this out.
[01:49:31.682 --> 01:49:31.862]  Yeah.
[01:49:32.381 --> 01:49:37.566]  And it's heartening to see that because it means that operationally on the ground there are not an awful lot of resources.
[01:49:38.086 --> 01:49:39.888]  It's just extraordinarily well applied.
[01:49:40.168 --> 01:49:47.615]  That's why they're probably going to carry out a terror attack to further imperial mobilize us as Zbigniew Brzezinski said in the Grand Chess Board.
[01:49:47.896 --> 01:49:49.557]  They've got to scare us into getting behind it.
[01:49:49.677 --> 01:49:52.240]  We'll be back with Fenton Dunne and I promise your calls directly.
[01:49:53.388 --> 01:50:00.230]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:01.910]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:04.291]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.451 --> 01:50:06.531]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.812 --> 01:50:11.773]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.093 --> 01:50:16.114]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.374 --> 01:50:18.155]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.175 --> 01:50:28.881]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.022 --> 01:50:30.923]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.143 --> 01:50:35.005]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.

[01:50:52.563 --> 01:50:58.767]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:50:58.927 --> 01:51:05.092]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:05.372 --> 01:51:13.818]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:14.058 --> 01:51:21.083]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:21.383 --> 01:51:26.206]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:26.426 --> 01:51:31.830]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:32.170 --> 01:51:35.252]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:35.593 --> 01:51:43.498]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.598 --> 01:51:44.158]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:53.664 --> 01:51:54.004]  I think so.
[01:52:08.909 --> 01:52:09.569]  We're good to go.

[01:52:53.659 --> 01:52:59.340]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:04.241]  Alright folks, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[01:53:05.121 --> 01:53:08.702]  Let's talk to Mary in North Carolina.
[01:53:08.742 --> 01:53:10.762]  Mary, you're on the air with Fenton Dunn and Alex Jones.
[01:53:10.802 --> 01:53:11.422]  Go ahead, Mary.
[01:53:11.442 --> 01:53:17.924]  Hi Alex, I wanted to call and let you know that I've been listening to you for probably the last six to eight months.
[01:53:18.024 --> 01:53:19.484]  I discovered you on the internet.
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:38.315]  And I've been following very closely your radio show and your videos that you have out because there's quite a few sites out there that, I won't say they honor you, but you're pretty much their prime interest and you're discussed and your videos are moved and talked about.
[01:53:40.076 --> 01:53:43.139]  But what I wanted to do was I wanted to call and I wanted to ask you a question today.
[01:53:43.159 --> 01:53:43.919]  Okay.
[01:53:44.139 --> 01:53:49.544]  And all the things that I listen from you on your tapes, your videos and everything,
[01:53:50.151 --> 01:54:06.276]  The one thing I don't hear, and I'm really concerned about is the fact, I take it from what I'm hearing of you, that you're basically a spiritual person, and you do believe in God, and my question is, if you do, and you know anything about Scripture, do you know this is all prophecy?
[01:54:07.384 --> 01:54:12.268]  Well, ma'am, I just try to give the people knowledge and get them to think and get them involved.
[01:54:12.308 --> 01:54:13.369]  This is a news show.
[01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:16.811]  It's not a religious show, though we've had a lot of pastors on.
[01:54:17.472 --> 01:54:20.815]  And we do defend people's religious liberty.
[01:54:21.475 --> 01:54:24.317]  And people thought Hitler was the Antichrist and laid down to him.
[01:54:24.357 --> 01:54:26.599]  People thought in Rwanda that it was the end of the world.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.861]  People think this all the time.
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:32.421]  And regardless, duty's mine, consequences are God's.
[01:54:33.041 --> 01:54:41.984]  I'm just going to expose the New World Order, and a lot of these so-called Christian churches, when you go get off of it, they say, oh, you know, it's all going to happen, lay down to it, go along with it.
[01:54:42.705 --> 01:54:45.386]  Well, that's not what my Bible says, and regardless, I'm going to fight evil.
[01:54:45.606 --> 01:54:47.086]  Fenton Dunne, you got any comments on that?
[01:54:48.086 --> 01:54:50.567]  Well, yeah, I think you've got to put it in perspective, too.
[01:54:51.568 --> 01:54:55.329]  There is a transformative aspect for the psyche and the psychology to all this.
[01:54:56.545 --> 01:55:02.738]  Yeah, we're dealing with end-of-the-world issues, but most of the end of the world is going to be the mental world we've got in our heads is going to end.
[01:55:03.219 --> 01:55:04.441]  That's going to be the big change.
[01:55:04.862 --> 01:55:07.568]  The earthquakes are going to be there more than they're going to be in the physical zone.
[01:55:08.704 --> 01:55:10.205]  Yeah, we're going to take the mark of the beast.
[01:55:10.325 --> 01:55:11.125]  We know this.
[01:55:11.365 --> 01:55:16.728]  We know that they're going to go through their processes and eventually we're going to have to come up with something.
[01:55:16.748 --> 01:55:20.230]  But the so-called Christians think they're going to be pulled out of it so they don't have to worry about it.
[01:55:20.350 --> 01:55:21.311]  And that's so wrong.
[01:55:21.371 --> 01:55:26.473]  And so when they start getting the chip, which is already starting, it must be good then because I haven't been raptured!
[01:55:26.653 --> 01:55:27.934]  And that's the big deception.
[01:55:28.534 --> 01:55:31.656]  And I realize you're not a religious show and I'm not really trying to go there.
[01:55:31.696 --> 01:55:34.977]  Basically all I'm trying to ask of you is
[01:55:36.693 --> 01:55:57.777]  In that consideration, do you, in fact, you know, do you agree that it is, you know, the Mark of the Beast is coming, and the people also need to prepare on a, some kind of spiritual level to prepare in that way, as well as trying to fight, because through, I'm sure you... Well, ma'am, unfortunately your radio's on.
[01:55:57.797 --> 01:55:58.897]  I'm having trouble understanding you.
[01:56:00.317 --> 01:56:01.117]  Can you turn the radio off?
[01:56:01.177 --> 01:56:02.538]  Yeah, I'm turning it off right now.
[01:56:02.558 --> 01:56:03.478]  Okay, that's always good.
[01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:14.060]  No, you can go there, it's just that this is not surely a broadcast where we sit here and cover the Bible.
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:19.126]  It is a news program, but we do contiguously cover these issues.
[01:56:19.993 --> 01:56:23.875]  But I'm saying I look at 90 plus percent of the so-called Christians.
[01:56:24.076 --> 01:56:24.916]  They love torture.
[01:56:24.956 --> 01:56:25.717]  They love evil.
[01:56:26.337 --> 01:56:27.398]  They think it's all wonderful.
[01:56:27.438 --> 01:56:28.578]  They think the chip is good.
[01:56:28.838 --> 01:56:29.979]  They think Bush is God.
[01:56:30.359 --> 01:56:38.844]  So all I do is I cover the news and tell people from a secular viewpoint they should fight Big Brother and this tyranny because I'm reaching out to the full audience.
[01:56:39.144 --> 01:56:45.428]  And what happens is a lot of people research the New World Order and then become Christians and we have a better effect than most of these preachers do out there.
[01:56:45.608 --> 01:56:46.609]  But I appreciate your call.
[01:56:47.461 --> 01:56:49.161]  And look, I mean, I've studied the globalists.
[01:56:49.201 --> 01:56:51.282]  Every time I've studied the globalists, it leads back to the occult.
[01:56:51.642 --> 01:56:52.602]  They do believe in the devil.
[01:56:53.102 --> 01:56:53.963]  And this is real.
[01:56:54.003 --> 01:56:54.783]  This is going on.
[01:56:54.803 --> 01:56:55.343]  Fit and done?
[01:56:56.283 --> 01:56:57.003]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:56:57.283 --> 01:57:01.965]  But I think what people have got to focus on is that this is our opportunity as well.
[01:57:01.985 --> 01:57:03.325]  It's a crisis opportunity.
[01:57:04.065 --> 01:57:11.487]  Yes, they're trying to put the mark on us, but it is in our response how we rise to that challenge that determines the triumph that we are going to have.
[01:57:12.145 --> 01:57:16.947]  This has been put up to us by the forces of evil in order that we overthrow them.
[01:57:17.367 --> 01:57:20.388]  Much as you might think that we can't do it, I'm telling you, we're going to do it.
[01:57:21.349 --> 01:57:23.289]  Well, God helps those that help themselves.
[01:57:23.469 --> 01:57:30.432]  I mean, how many times has God sent a prophet to a country, and if they repented and changed their ways, that's the promise they don't get destroyed.
[01:57:30.452 --> 01:57:32.373]  I mean, you reap what you sow.
[01:57:32.393 --> 01:57:36.514]  If you let evil grow and don't think you can't fight it, it'll grow and take over.
[01:57:37.234 --> 01:57:38.575]  So, it's just that simple.
[01:57:39.715 --> 01:57:42.936]  So, we'll be right back with the second hour with Fenton Dunn.
[01:57:42.956 --> 01:57:47.398]  Stay with us.
[01:57:49.939 --> 01:57:50.599]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.259 --> 01:57:52.339]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:54.140]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:55.600]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.341 --> 01:57:57.301]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.921 --> 01:58:01.722]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.103 --> 01:58:06.164]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.751 --> 01:58:10.613]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, already into hour number three.
[01:58:10.673 --> 01:58:13.135]  We've got a fascinating individual with a great website.
[01:58:13.375 --> 01:58:15.776]  BreitforNews.com, Fenton Dunn from Ireland.
[01:58:15.796 --> 01:58:20.179]  We're talking about State Department quash 9-11 links to global drug trade.
[01:58:20.659 --> 01:58:26.883]  FBI whistleblower saying that there were these scrub teams protecting all forms of criminal activity being run by elements of the government.
[01:58:28.184 --> 01:58:32.767]  And she was told to cover up 9-11 prior knowledge, refused and has been threatened by John Ashcroft.
[01:58:33.999 --> 01:58:35.440]  We've had this happen to many other people.
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:37.182]  I appreciate Mary's call in the last hour.
[01:58:37.442 --> 01:58:41.425]  We're about to go to Brent, and Brenton, and Bill, and Fred, and Kevin, and many others.
[01:58:41.986 --> 01:58:45.048]  But what's some of the other information you think we should cover in this hour, Fenton?
[01:58:45.068 --> 01:58:49.192]  I want to throw some different news articles out at you and get your take on them, but what's some of the issues?
[01:58:49.212 --> 01:58:51.794]  I mean, is there anything else we need to cover concerning civil evidence?
[01:58:52.795 --> 01:59:02.943]  Well, I think we've got to follow some of the specifics of the drug trade links and the Iran-Contra links, because it is Iran-Contra personnel we're talking about here, and they are back in town.
[01:59:03.864 --> 01:59:07.786]  Armitage recently said the State Department is now the dominant voice in Iraq.
[01:59:08.266 --> 01:59:11.547]  So it's Armitage, true Negroponte, running Iraq.
[01:59:12.047 --> 01:59:13.728]  And who are we talking about here?
[01:59:13.868 --> 01:59:15.028]  Iran Contra Reloaded.
[01:59:16.309 --> 01:59:17.669]  All the same characters.
[01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:22.871]  And these guys, when you see them in Senate hearings, they're such kingpins.
[01:59:22.911 --> 01:59:24.452]  They're so arrogant.
[01:59:24.772 --> 01:59:27.893]  You know, the whole MO just of their demeanor is mafioso.
[01:59:29.113 --> 01:59:31.214]  Armitage is a nasty piece of work, Alex.
[01:59:33.174 --> 01:59:35.114]  That's one thing I don't mind saying on air.
[01:59:35.374 --> 01:59:37.255]  Let's talk about Armitage.
[01:59:38.595 --> 01:59:45.358]  Well, Al Martin has a recent article where he's highlighted Armitage's links to the global cocaine trade.
[01:59:47.639 --> 01:59:52.660]  I think that his participation in those Iran-Contra events was a pivotal one back at the time.
[01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:54.501]  He goes back to Vietnam!
[01:59:57.502 --> 01:59:59.943]  I'm not an expert on Armitage, but
[02:00:02.017 --> 02:00:12.606]  I just see him playing the same role again, except now we have, it's not just a question of the South American link, now we've got this massive amount of opium being generated in Afghanistan.
[02:00:13.226 --> 02:00:19.071]  So it once again points us in the direction of realizing that that was the key motivating factor going into Afghanistan.
[02:00:19.612 --> 02:00:22.294]  Yeah, the level has just exploded to record levels.
[02:00:22.904 --> 02:00:27.966]  Yeah, and the oil issue is a side issue, because there were various ways to manipulate the oil issue over time.
[02:00:28.387 --> 02:00:32.508]  But the Taliban had effectively put a huge hole in the opium crop down there.
[02:00:33.209 --> 02:00:36.370]  And I don't know who was inspiring the Taliban, I suspect the Chinese were.
[02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:43.974]  But if the idea was to cut off the source of supply of this international network, then it didn't work, because they sent in the entire U.S.
[02:00:44.034 --> 02:00:45.694]  Army in order to take back the poppy fields.
[02:00:47.155 --> 02:00:50.197]  So it's as base as that, when you get right down to it.
[02:00:50.257 --> 02:00:51.077]  Strip away all the
[02:00:51.590 --> 02:00:56.555]  Talk about oil, as if oil was the only issue, and get right back down to drugs.
[02:00:57.536 --> 02:01:01.701]  Well, it's the hundreds of millions of unaccountable money laundered cash.
[02:01:02.542 --> 02:01:08.068]  It's the hundreds of millions every year in weapons sales and government contracts in the war, no bids.
[02:01:09.072 --> 02:01:15.401]  It's the domestic police state, and the prisons, and the grid, owned by the same drug dealers and criminals that run the New World Order.
[02:01:15.661 --> 02:01:20.687]  They then own the private prisons, and the surveillance camera companies, and the private Merck security companies.
[02:01:20.968 --> 02:01:26.455]  I mean, this war on terror is a way to engineer the entire global economy through their coffers.
[02:01:27.566 --> 02:01:41.951]  Yeah, I see a worrying development in all of this as well, a trend which is just growing and growing, and that is the privatization, corporatization of the intelligence services, the military services, military supply services, the entire thing is being privatized.
[02:01:42.031 --> 02:01:43.951]  And that's just mercenaries.
[02:01:44.231 --> 02:01:48.713]  They're giving them government power, total anonymity, and then they're running the prisons, they're running the systems.
[02:01:49.628 --> 02:01:49.808]  Yeah.
[02:01:50.128 --> 02:01:57.730]  Now, in the past, there was at least an accountability to some kind of a national interest of some description in these intelligence and military networks.
[02:01:57.870 --> 02:01:59.510]  Now we're being wholesale looted.
[02:01:59.790 --> 02:02:00.030]  Yeah.
[02:02:00.931 --> 02:02:02.231]  Now they're working for the corporates.
[02:02:03.471 --> 02:02:06.872]  And that is even more, that is much more worrying than them working for national interest.
[02:02:07.032 --> 02:02:09.533]  Yeah, in the past, the corporates directed the government.
[02:02:09.953 --> 02:02:15.574]  Now they're removing that membrane of that separation and just making the corporations the government.
[02:02:17.139 --> 02:02:17.299]  Yeah.
[02:02:17.579 --> 02:02:19.340]  But that's what they always do in the final phase.
[02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:23.021]  I've said communism, socialism leads to communism, leads to fascism.
[02:02:23.421 --> 02:02:29.002]  In the final phase, you get what you have in Russia, where they just take over the government and a few corporations run things.
[02:02:30.263 --> 02:02:33.764]  Well, we've seen that with Putin and what he has done.
[02:02:35.604 --> 02:02:40.206]  The so-called backlash against the oligarchs is really just a transfer of power to some new owners again.
[02:02:41.146 --> 02:02:44.627]  There has been a power struggle in Russia, but... We've got to berate calls coming up.
[02:02:45.751 --> 02:02:48.053]  The sun is getting brighter and the days are getting longer.
[02:02:48.253 --> 02:02:49.555]  Summer's just around the corner.
[02:02:49.795 --> 02:02:51.016]  What are your plans for it?
[02:02:51.316 --> 02:02:51.697]  Fishing?
[02:02:51.977 --> 02:02:52.418]  Gardening?
[02:02:52.478 --> 02:02:52.898]  Camping?
[02:02:53.098 --> 02:02:55.240]  I'm sure you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors.
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:58.644]  And I'm sure the ticks and mosquitoes will spend more time enjoying you.
[02:02:58.864 --> 02:03:01.226]  It's not just itching and scratching we have to worry about.
[02:03:01.506 --> 02:03:04.870]  Now there's incurable illnesses like Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.
[02:03:05.210 --> 02:03:10.335]  Teet is proven to keep the bugs away, but it's also proven to cause brain damage in laboratory animals.
[02:03:10.675 --> 02:03:16.462]  That's not a choice I want to make, and I don't have to, thanks to Natural Answer, available at NaturalAnswer.com.

[02:06:02.094 --> 02:06:06.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.573 --> 02:06:16.435]  We were just talking to Sybil Edmonds during the break, and we're going to be getting her on next week with Fenton Dunne again.
[02:06:16.455 --> 02:06:26.617]  We're going to work that out and do it, and coming up a little later, we're going to air a little eight-minute segment of an interview that Fenton did with her a few weeks ago.
[02:06:26.677 --> 02:06:31.098]  Just massive news here, but as promised, let's go to these loaded phone lines.
[02:06:31.958 --> 02:06:33.938]  Brent in Washington, you're on the air.
[02:06:33.998 --> 02:06:34.318]  Welcome.
[02:06:35.659 --> 02:06:35.939]  Hi, Alex.
[02:06:38.058 --> 02:06:39.819]  I've got my volume all the way down.
[02:06:39.879 --> 02:06:43.242]  Is that okay, or do you want me to just shut the power on the radio completely off?
[02:06:43.402 --> 02:06:44.262]  No, no, that's fine.
[02:06:44.282 --> 02:06:46.083]  As long as your radio's not broadcasting audio.
[02:06:46.124 --> 02:06:46.644]  Go ahead.
[02:06:47.004 --> 02:06:47.504]  Beautiful.
[02:06:47.865 --> 02:06:57.691]  Hey, your analogy of on the last cut and Satan opening his jaws, getting ready to bring judgment on this land, that's right on.
[02:06:57.791 --> 02:06:58.532]  I commend you for that.
[02:07:00.646 --> 02:07:01.306]  Very commendable.
[02:07:01.506 --> 02:07:02.046]  Well, thank you.
[02:07:02.246 --> 02:07:07.888]  Do you have any comments about civil admins or this global drug trade and how the FBI is in there protecting all these criminals?
[02:07:08.688 --> 02:07:15.530]  Well, no, but I did have a question on... Could you give me your hypothesis as to what you know on everything?
[02:07:16.890 --> 02:07:22.512]  It's been said you were real accurate within just a few weeks or a month or so of 9-11 attacks.
[02:07:22.532 --> 02:07:27.873]  Do you see anything possibly coming down, say, by late summer or early fall?
[02:07:28.554 --> 02:07:29.814]  Well, the globalists
[02:07:30.891 --> 02:07:32.292]  We're getting very obvious.
[02:07:32.452 --> 02:07:34.834]  They were preparing us psychologically before 9-11.
[02:07:35.134 --> 02:07:37.076]  They said, suddenly, here's Bin Laden.
[02:07:37.096 --> 02:07:37.817]  Remember him?
[02:07:38.417 --> 02:07:39.178]  Here's his face.
[02:07:39.218 --> 02:07:39.898]  Here's a video.
[02:07:39.938 --> 02:07:41.099]  He's about to get you.
[02:07:41.419 --> 02:07:43.901]  And when he gets you, give all your rights up.
[02:07:43.921 --> 02:07:46.603]  And then I saw CFR members going, those buildings are in trouble.
[02:07:47.704 --> 02:07:50.727]  You know, Gary Hart and Warren Rubin laughing on Hardball.
[02:07:52.023 --> 02:07:55.566]  I started, through my government sources, hearing that they were planning something big.
[02:07:56.167 --> 02:08:02.152]  And so I got on air, for the first time and only time, and I said, call the White House, call Congress, tell them, don't attack New York.
[02:08:02.472 --> 02:08:04.334]  They're probably going to attack the World Trade Center.
[02:08:04.374 --> 02:08:06.135]  Tell the government we know they're about to do it.
[02:08:06.676 --> 02:08:11.380]  And so, probably over 15 shows every day, hours every day.
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:14.482]  I need to re-air some of those broadcasts.
[02:08:14.943 --> 02:08:15.724]  I said, call them.
[02:08:15.744 --> 02:08:17.805]  I called it Operation Expose the Government Terrorist.
[02:08:18.646 --> 02:08:19.507]  And, uh,
[02:08:20.259 --> 02:08:33.134]  They've been kind of back and forth, not knowing what they're going to do from what I've gotten from their own propaganda, because they always have preparatory propaganda to give us our response even before it happens, try to plant that in our minds.
[02:08:33.634 --> 02:08:36.017]  But now, for the first time in two and a half years since 9-11,
[02:08:37.378 --> 02:08:49.444]  They're saying, America will be attacked by the election, the Capitol will be destroyed, coast-to-coast attacks, and now the AP says, oh, there's Federal Elections Commission plans to cancel the elections if there's a terror attack.
[02:08:49.464 --> 02:08:57.287]  They're trying to discuss different plans, and top generals are talking about how good martial law is here domestically to keep us safe.
[02:08:57.828 --> 02:09:03.910]  So I'm not sure they're about to launch an attack, and I don't have enough info to know where it's going to be like I did in 2001,
[02:09:05.591 --> 02:09:22.125]  Early 2001, but I would say that if they think they can get away with it, they've got a bunch of different plans ready right now, and if they think we'll buy into it, they're going to carry out terror attacks, give us the national draft, and I don't know if the terror attack is going to come before the election or right after it.
[02:09:23.086 --> 02:09:27.930]  I don't think the globalists know what plan they're going to activate, but they've got several different scripts running.
[02:09:28.171 --> 02:09:29.612]  Fenton Dunne, do you have any comments on this?
[02:09:30.191 --> 02:09:35.135]  Yeah, I'd agree that they're monitoring it just like you would with a marketing campaign for a new type of cola.
[02:09:35.155 --> 02:09:40.739]  You know, they've got their teams out there just monitoring the overall public acceptance levels.
[02:09:41.059 --> 02:09:43.260]  They're also watching what we're up to on the internet.
[02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:45.302]  They're gauging the kind of impact that we're having.
[02:09:45.342 --> 02:09:51.306]  They're plotting and predicting the rate at which the truth will get out and calculating all this into their final determinations.
[02:09:51.386 --> 02:09:52.907]  It's all to play for right now.
[02:09:55.349 --> 02:09:55.549]  Alex?
[02:09:55.889 --> 02:09:56.150]  Yes?
[02:09:56.730 --> 02:09:58.051]  Yeah, one more comment.
[02:09:58.553 --> 02:10:07.760]  On your website, another sign I'm seeing that is kind of red-alerting me is this uneasiness of Cheney and Bush recently.
[02:10:09.221 --> 02:10:16.426]  Yeah, how Cheney's cussing at people on the Senate floor and Bush is blowing up and screaming profanities at staff members.
[02:10:18.167 --> 02:10:25.292]  Meanwhile, we have this giant fleet action, the biggest ever, seven carriers in Asia, several in the Middle East,
[02:10:26.225 --> 02:10:30.106]  At the same time, we have British soldiers being grabbed off patrol boats.
[02:10:31.086 --> 02:10:38.767]  The Telegraph reporting yesterday that the British were ordered to attack the Iranians, but refused, just like at Pristina.
[02:10:39.387 --> 02:10:44.608]  In Serbia, when they were ordered to go ahead and go in against the Russians, and they said, I'm not going to start World War III for you.
[02:10:45.108 --> 02:10:46.369]  Fenton Dunne, comments on that?
[02:10:47.409 --> 02:10:54.130]  Yeah, I would say that the Bush crew are definitely nervous, because there's always been an option there to dump the Bush crew and use them as the
[02:10:55.014 --> 02:10:57.915]  Fall guys for the whole of the Iraq invasion phase.
[02:10:58.675 --> 02:11:06.618]  Also you can then resell the situation to the Iraqis saying, well now Bush is gone and you know you can take the UN as your replacement for Bush.
[02:11:06.978 --> 02:11:08.978]  So that's pretty much in play right now.
[02:11:09.218 --> 02:11:10.699]  I think the Bush team have been sold out.
[02:11:11.779 --> 02:11:12.459]  That's my feeling.
[02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:15.921]  Abu Ghraib was the convincer for me.
[02:11:15.941 --> 02:11:23.483]  It takes a lot to organize that and then to get it out on CBS at the exact critical moment when it was going to take out the Bush administration in April, May.
[02:11:24.941 --> 02:11:25.401]  Exactly.
[02:11:25.421 --> 02:11:26.942]  They told Bush, order the torture.
[02:11:26.962 --> 02:11:27.742]  We're going to protect you.
[02:11:27.782 --> 02:11:28.562]  You're the darling.
[02:11:28.582 --> 02:11:30.523]  Then they start bringing all of this out.
[02:11:30.563 --> 02:11:31.663]  Thanks for the call, Brett.
[02:11:32.163 --> 02:11:33.003]  Bill in Ohio.
[02:11:33.023 --> 02:11:33.864]  You're on the air, Bill.
[02:11:33.884 --> 02:11:34.324]  Go ahead.
[02:11:34.344 --> 02:11:35.744]  How are you doing?
[02:11:36.204 --> 02:11:36.784]  Good.
[02:11:36.824 --> 02:11:46.667]  Listen, I've been hearing you talk about, make comparisons with the way society is moving today, with things that have been talked about in the past.
[02:11:46.687 --> 02:11:48.968]  You've made references to George Orwell and so forth.
[02:11:50.988 --> 02:11:53.529]  Just in the last few days, it's kind of dawned on me
[02:11:54.615 --> 02:12:04.200]  When I was a youngster back in around the sixties, early and mid-sixties, I seem to recall reading a book at that time.
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:05.761]  I was a big science fiction fan.
[02:12:06.761 --> 02:12:07.401]  I read a book.
[02:12:07.821 --> 02:12:09.402]  I can't recall the name of the author.
[02:12:09.882 --> 02:12:11.783]  I'm going to try to hunt it up if I can find it.
[02:12:11.803 --> 02:12:13.284]  That stuff never seems to go out of print.
[02:12:14.405 --> 02:12:15.665]  It was called The Syndic.
[02:12:16.586 --> 02:12:17.846]  S-Y-N-D-I-C.
[02:12:18.787 --> 02:12:23.389]  It was about a United States of the future where
[02:12:24.215 --> 02:12:25.075]  Basically, the U.S.
[02:12:25.115 --> 02:12:30.416]  government had become a crime syndicate, and we were pretty much running the entire world.
[02:12:32.597 --> 02:12:35.418]  And that's about as much as I can remember.
[02:12:35.798 --> 02:12:37.258]  It's been a while since I read it.
[02:12:37.278 --> 02:12:38.038]  You know, a long time.
[02:12:39.779 --> 02:12:42.459]  This is how the seduction process takes place.
[02:12:42.539 --> 02:12:46.940]  They say, we've got to control the cocaine or the communist will.
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:49.501]  We've got to control the opium or the communist will.
[02:12:50.262 --> 02:12:53.444]  But then you find out it's the big banks funding the communists as well.
[02:12:53.704 --> 02:13:04.112]  They create this false bipolar world and then say to the people in government, we've got to be more evil than them to defeat them, to be guardians of civilization.
[02:13:04.632 --> 02:13:05.833]  This is the sales pitch.
[02:13:06.433 --> 02:13:08.955]  And then they end up taking over every form of crime.
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:11.701]  And that's what's happened today.
[02:13:11.721 --> 02:13:14.003]  Fenton, any comments to what Bill was just saying?
[02:13:14.423 --> 02:13:16.004]  Yeah, I think you put your finger on it there.
[02:13:16.044 --> 02:13:35.415]  I can almost see the behind closed doors, leader-to-leader discussions and briefings going on about how it was a legitimate move to take over the drug trade because they could then divert that into uses for democratic purposes, so to speak, instead of leaving it to the free marketeers to control those funds.
[02:13:35.905 --> 02:13:40.129]  But it was a very quick... Now, people want drugs, somebody's gonna do it, we better control it.
[02:13:40.469 --> 02:13:47.255]  Instead of decriminalizing it, then people don't want to use it because it's not cool, there's not money involved associated with it.
[02:13:47.615 --> 02:13:55.101]  And the very same people running in the illegal drugs of the government, and their private owners, are the same ones pushing all these even more deadly legal drugs on people.
[02:13:56.222 --> 02:14:04.169]  Yeah, that's why the drug issue is key to it all, because just look at the social impact which the prohibition era had, and that only went on for a few years.
[02:14:04.614 --> 02:14:08.955]  And we are now 30 years into this criminalization of drug taking.
[02:14:09.575 --> 02:14:10.716]  And it's destroyed us.
[02:14:11.996 --> 02:14:13.717]  This is where I feel it's at the heart of the matter.
[02:14:13.757 --> 02:14:16.657]  And that's why I feel Sibel Edmonds' links are so important to follow.
[02:14:16.897 --> 02:14:19.278]  Because it's all about drugs and what they've done.
[02:14:19.318 --> 02:14:33.022]  Well, Prohibition tripled the size of the Mafia, corrupted the police, and grew the size of the government, got people used to checkpoints, searching for the alcohol, and they used the well-meaning, you know, Christians
[02:14:33.914 --> 02:14:35.795]  Yeah, and at the same time I've spoken to
[02:14:46.781 --> 02:14:55.126]  sort of middle-of-the-road conservative Republicans in the USA who said on the drugs issue, when you talk to them just person-to-person, give them the drugs for crying out loud.
[02:14:55.206 --> 02:14:56.187]  Give them free!
[02:14:56.567 --> 02:15:01.190]  You know, make them watch a video for ten minutes about what effect it's doing on them and give it to them for free.
[02:15:01.210 --> 02:15:10.716]  So there's no real... Well, they've done that, they've tested that, it makes drug use go way down, but you put a black market on it and attach Porsches and Mercedes to it, young kids are going to use it.
[02:15:11.936 --> 02:15:13.877]  Yeah, so they've blocked us on that and
[02:15:15.143 --> 02:15:21.827]  In order to make headway on this, we've got to get rid of the current attitude that is out there towards drugs, because it's just funding these people is what it's doing.
[02:15:21.927 --> 02:15:27.230]  Well, time and time again, they use well-meaning, good Christians who are not informed to follow this devilish system.
[02:15:27.930 --> 02:15:31.412]  The road to hell is paved with good intentions, but it's not their good intentions.
[02:15:31.452 --> 02:15:32.713]  They use your good intentions.
[02:15:33.433 --> 02:15:34.173]  Bill, anything else?
[02:15:34.854 --> 02:15:35.714]  No, that was all.
[02:15:35.754 --> 02:15:40.037]  I just thought if you were able to locate that book and take a look at it, you might find it interesting.
[02:15:40.317 --> 02:15:41.297]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:15:41.898 --> 02:15:43.759]  Let's talk to Fred in Pennsylvania.
[02:15:43.779 --> 02:15:44.419]  Fred, go ahead.
[02:15:47.909 --> 02:15:53.511]  You're brilliant on the geopolitical aspect of it.
[02:15:53.611 --> 02:15:57.291]  I wanted to bring up something from something I've been looking at.
[02:15:57.311 --> 02:16:03.293]  The legality of the international technique of these liaisons.
[02:16:04.533 --> 02:16:14.495]  Interpol and my theory is that the individuals in Interpol get back and give information to
[02:16:15.810 --> 02:16:29.575]  uh... the agencies in this country to to avoid any kind of scrutiny or or or well that's the whole point sir it's to protect their criminal activities and then to bust a few patsies to pack the private prisons that the criminals own.
[02:16:30.575 --> 02:16:34.777]  How do we uh... how do we ever fight the uh... the secrecy of that?
[02:16:34.797 --> 02:16:35.637]  Let me give you an example.
[02:16:36.257 --> 02:16:43.140]  Interpol has now with the federal government taken over part of the Austin Police Department and they've sworn them in as these international police.
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:44.180]  I mean that was on the news.
[02:16:44.935 --> 02:16:50.500]  But now the international police should come here and arrest me under their foreign laws, and then we can go arrest people under our laws.
[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:51.301]  Fenton comments.
[02:16:51.902 --> 02:16:56.766]  Yeah, they've got... They're gearing up towards the international police system now.
[02:16:57.287 --> 02:17:01.751]  And it's been run on a couple of fronts, and that's one of them where Interpol has now been pressed forward.
[02:17:02.111 --> 02:17:04.193]  And Interpol is just really a flag of convenience.
[02:17:04.273 --> 02:17:07.536]  It's nothing more than a bureaucratic arrangement, rather than anything more than that.
[02:17:08.157 --> 02:17:11.720]  So I think that the control of all of that is going to go extra-national.
[02:17:12.443 --> 02:17:14.324]  It's got to go outside the control of one country.
[02:17:14.525 --> 02:17:29.056]  Well, can I ask you what kind of, uh, what kind of, they do keep this pretense of it all being legal, but what kind of, uh, you know, check is there on that that they're saying?
[02:17:29.316 --> 02:17:30.277]  There isn't any check.
[02:17:30.297 --> 02:17:34.079]  They're private groups announcing governmental power, just like the World Trade Organization.
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:37.262]  We have to expose them, discredit them as murdering criminals.
[02:17:37.782 --> 02:17:38.463]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:38.523 --> 02:17:40.504]  We have to cut their funding, get out of these systems.
[02:17:40.724 --> 02:17:41.305]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.518 --> 02:17:48.980]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:52.761]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[02:18:57.013 --> 02:19:04.058]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:19:04.439 --> 02:19:10.524]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:19:10.684 --> 02:19:11.905]  There are no side effects.
[02:19:12.245 --> 02:19:15.187]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[02:19:44.033 --> 02:19:48.754]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:19:48.974 --> 02:19:52.415]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:19:52.635 --> 02:19:55.096]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:19:55.336 --> 02:20:03.938]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:20:04.298 --> 02:20:10.059]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.

[02:20:44.381 --> 02:20:45.722]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[02:20:45.882 --> 02:20:49.643]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck too.
[02:20:49.803 --> 02:20:53.524]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[02:20:53.825 --> 02:20:57.446]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[02:20:57.686 --> 02:21:02.108]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[02:21:02.448 --> 02:21:06.249]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:07.190]  It really works!
[02:21:07.450 --> 02:21:13.572]  NT Oil Additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[02:21:13.832 --> 02:21:14.953]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[02:21:15.233 --> 02:21:17.774]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[02:21:17.934 --> 02:21:21.176]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps and air tools.
[02:21:21.396 --> 02:21:26.439]  Gearboxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[02:21:26.639 --> 02:21:28.059]  Diesel engines thrive on it too.

[02:21:54.415 --> 02:22:00.617]  Alright, continuing with your calls, we'll air a segment of an interview that Penton Dunn did with the civil admins coming up in the next segment.
[02:22:01.478 --> 02:22:06.379]  Continuing with your calls, I've got some other news items I'm going to throw out here in just a moment, but these calls are all very interesting.
[02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:11.401]  I guess up next here would be, who is up next, Stephanie?
[02:22:12.962 --> 02:22:14.644]  Kevin and Jenna Sue, you're on the air.
[02:22:14.704 --> 02:22:15.064]  Welcome.
[02:22:15.364 --> 02:22:16.405]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:16.545 --> 02:22:17.006]  It's awesome.
[02:22:17.086 --> 02:22:18.407]  I've listened to you for a long time.
[02:22:18.427 --> 02:22:19.608]  This is the first time I've called in.
[02:22:19.628 --> 02:22:32.058]  I just wanted to say along the lines of what Ted was saying about how the Bush family or Bush has been compromised and he's now kind of going to, like you've always said, he's going to play the part of the bad cop.
[02:22:32.619 --> 02:22:39.845]  I got out of Fahrenheit 9-11 last night and everybody got up and cheered and clapped and there was definitely a lot to cheer and clap about.
[02:22:40.697 --> 02:22:46.722]  Then a chill went up my spine, and me and my friends were walking out of the theater together, and they're all just so excited.
[02:22:46.762 --> 02:22:49.704]  I could see that they had kind of gotten a little spark.
[02:22:50.344 --> 02:22:55.068]  I said, guys, you've got to just remember that the revolution isn't going to be televised.
[02:22:55.388 --> 02:22:59.731]  We couldn't get in this movie for three days.
[02:22:59.811 --> 02:23:02.253]  It was sold out, and it's packed.
[02:23:02.493 --> 02:23:03.514]  I was like, this isn't...
[02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:14.483]  Well, what it does, again, they play this back and forth, and they'll put a Democrat in, he'll sell us out, they'll put a Republican in, he'll sell us out, they're all in the same system.
[02:23:14.823 --> 02:23:15.403]  Fittin' done?
[02:23:15.463 --> 02:23:15.863]  Comments?
[02:23:16.623 --> 02:23:19.184]  Yeah, I've seen the, you know, they're experts at this.
[02:23:19.224 --> 02:23:25.366]  This is why this grouping has managed to control both sides, because they bat the ball back and forward between Republican and Democrat so effectively.
[02:23:25.986 --> 02:23:35.269]  And, uh, I believe that GWB was sold out at the highest levels, he's, operationally he was sold out by military intelligence who took the photos, CBS who put them on air,
[02:23:35.876 --> 02:23:38.657]  And also by military moves in Iraq designed to embarrass him.
[02:23:39.017 --> 02:23:45.180]  And that was a two-month horrible period for the Bush administration, where they were holed below the waterline.
[02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:46.981]  And you'll see the rest of it unfold.
[02:23:47.041 --> 02:23:48.242]  Believe me, there's more to come.
[02:23:48.842 --> 02:23:50.022]  They're not finished with Bush yet.
[02:23:51.223 --> 02:23:54.284]  And you'll hate him just as much as you hated Osama bin Laden.
[02:23:54.344 --> 02:23:58.086]  He's going to be the new hate guy, and then the good guys are going to come to our rescue.
[02:23:58.106 --> 02:23:59.667]  Now, they've got Zarqawi now.
[02:23:59.687 --> 02:24:04.769]  I mean, you've got Rumsfeld on television the other day with Zarqawi, and people are asking him specifics.
[02:24:05.299 --> 02:24:06.199]  He just kind of gets a grin.
[02:24:06.239 --> 02:24:14.443]  He's like, oh, well, he may be, uh, you know, now him and Bin Laden may have some differences of opinion and maybe that they're going to be vying for power.
[02:24:14.463 --> 02:24:19.886]  You know, you know, it's just, there's always something, there's always somebody they just hold up, you know.
[02:24:20.826 --> 02:24:23.047]  Well, they claim they've killed this guy a couple of times.
[02:24:23.147 --> 02:24:23.867]  I mean, it just.
[02:24:24.127 --> 02:24:24.428]  Yeah.
[02:24:24.488 --> 02:24:33.972]  And I would bring that up to my parents and my friends and I'm like, you know, cause I mean, people are talking about this guy, you know, like he's the new Bin Laden and I'm like, look guys, you know, I've read reports that he's dead.
[02:24:35.108 --> 02:24:37.490]  That was MSNBC four months ago.
[02:24:37.651 --> 02:24:53.444]  And the same people that we were like negotiating with, you know, at certain times, and that kind of wasn't real big news, but we were negotiating with some of these militias at times, they're the same people that are saying, look, this guy's dead, and like, this happened, and you're saying it's this guy, and we're telling you it's not.
[02:24:53.764 --> 02:24:54.164]  I hear you.
[02:24:54.184 --> 02:24:55.165]  I appreciate the call.
[02:24:55.505 --> 02:24:56.126]  Good call.
[02:24:56.947 --> 02:24:58.908]  Let's talk to Ian in Canada.
[02:24:58.928 --> 02:24:59.669]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:25:00.490 --> 02:25:01.131]  Thanks Alex.
[02:25:01.711 --> 02:25:28.927]  I thought your guest is really appropriate this morning because this is two days after an election here where the Canadian electorate chose to put in the same Prime Minister who was part of a government that robbed them of two billion dollars through a fraudulent gun registry program and a government which has turned reality on its head by accepting same-sex marriage by fiat and that Prime Minister is Paul Martin
[02:25:29.457 --> 02:25:33.378]  He owns a operation called Canada Steamship Lines.
[02:25:33.879 --> 02:25:35.619]  The media says, well, he doesn't own it anymore.
[02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:44.483]  He sold it to his sons, and this morning, 83 kilograms of cocaine was found in the hold of a Canada Steamship Lines ship.
[02:25:45.643 --> 02:25:48.524]  I'm wondering what your guest would say about that.
[02:25:50.465 --> 02:25:52.686]  Well, there's obviously a northern route for the coke as well.
[02:25:54.065 --> 02:26:01.267]  And I think that these networks are operating efficiently in all major economies, and they're operating with high-level support.
[02:26:01.967 --> 02:26:06.608]  These operations are not being busted because they've got top-level support, and I mean political support.
[02:26:07.128 --> 02:26:07.288]  Yes.
[02:26:07.788 --> 02:26:10.689]  Alex, before you let me go, can I make another observation?
[02:26:11.289 --> 02:26:17.351]  You've always said that the police forces, domestic police, are tied in intimately with the military intelligence.
[02:26:18.051 --> 02:26:21.392]  And, you know, they say that hidden in plain sight is the credo of the
[02:26:22.133 --> 02:26:24.014]  The Illuminati and the Masonic Movement.
[02:26:24.594 --> 02:26:27.816]  In Toronto at their police headquarters, they're sticking it in our face.
[02:26:28.476 --> 02:26:38.301]  If some of your listeners come up from the States and go to Toronto, try and find the Metro Police Headquarters and see the three sculptures that are at the base of the headquarters.
[02:26:39.262 --> 02:26:39.702]  Two of them.
[02:26:40.222 --> 02:26:47.246]  One is an obelisk, curiously enough based on a bronze statue of a child pulling a wagon for the base of the obelisk.
[02:26:48.004 --> 02:26:59.347]  And the other at the entrance to the headquarters is a four and a half foot high stepped Babylonian pyramid with a female constable in bronze applying a trowel to it.
[02:26:59.867 --> 02:27:12.489]  If you step back across the street and look up at the headquarters of the Toronto Police you will see that the whole building is one great stepped pyramid capped by a dome with a framed pyramid containing it.
[02:27:13.470 --> 02:27:15.130]  I know the globalists love to do
[02:27:15.925 --> 02:27:20.346]  Their architecture is throwing our face down a communicated, hidden in plain view, as you said.
[02:27:20.726 --> 02:27:21.366]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:21.426 --> 02:27:26.647]  We'll come back and talk to Mike and Eric and Jesse.
[02:27:26.667 --> 02:27:29.548]  And that's it for calls, because I want to play this clip and cover some other news.
[02:27:30.148 --> 02:27:31.788]  PresentPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:27:31.808 --> 02:27:34.969]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.989 --> 02:27:36.889]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.389 --> 02:27:38.989]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.909 --> 02:27:42.590]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.979 --> 02:27:48.341]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:27:48.602 --> 02:27:52.446]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:27:52.766 --> 02:27:53.567]  Read the labels.
[02:27:54.007 --> 02:27:58.151]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:58.351 --> 02:28:02.536]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:28:02.916 --> 02:28:07.801]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:28:08.161 --> 02:28:11.763]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:28:11.943 --> 02:28:17.286]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:28:17.546 --> 02:28:20.287]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:28:20.588 --> 02:28:21.488]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:28:21.788 --> 02:28:32.514]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[02:28:45.225 --> 02:28:52.728]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:53.008 --> 02:29:03.913]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:29:05.414 --> 02:29:09.576]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:09.917 --> 02:29:20.363]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:20.663 --> 02:29:21.183]  That's right!
[02:29:21.343 --> 02:29:28.466]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:28.746 --> 02:29:32.888]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[02:29:45.865 --> 02:29:46.865]  It's finally here!
[02:29:47.005 --> 02:29:47.966]  Spring has arrived!
[02:29:48.166 --> 02:29:51.126]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:29:51.346 --> 02:29:54.807]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:29:55.027 --> 02:30:03.169]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:07.170]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:30:07.370 --> 02:30:12.391]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:30:12.671 --> 02:30:17.195]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:30:17.375 --> 02:30:21.439]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:30:21.519 --> 02:30:28.665]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!

[02:30:46.556 --> 02:30:49.297]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:30:49.317 --> 02:30:53.240]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:56.902 --> 02:30:58.603]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:59.696 --> 02:31:01.637]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:31:02.357 --> 02:31:05.359]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[02:31:05.399 --> 02:31:08.020]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:31:09.961 --> 02:31:15.863]  And as we head towards our country's Independence Day, I want you to remember what the Declaration of Independence states, what it lays out.
[02:31:16.824 --> 02:31:22.226]  I want you to know that that's being destroyed and that it's our right to throw off corrupt
[02:31:22.865 --> 02:31:29.191]  Out-of-control government, that evil government, that organized crime is the norm, that liberty is the exception, and we have to fight.
[02:31:29.291 --> 02:31:30.232]  Freedom is not free!
[02:31:31.793 --> 02:31:45.226]  We're about to go back and take a few final calls, get into a bunch of news, and play about, I don't know, 5-10 minutes of this, vent-and-done interview with Sybil Evans, but before we do that, just briefly, again, I've made 10 films, 2 on 9-11, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and The Masters of Terror.
[02:31:46.173 --> 02:31:48.774]  There's Matrix of Evil, Police State, Three Total Enslavement.
[02:31:48.814 --> 02:31:50.055]  Those are some of my newest films.
[02:31:50.575 --> 02:31:53.016]  I'm carrying several other new videos on 9-11.
[02:31:53.557 --> 02:32:01.641]  One that just came out by George Humphrey, incredibly well done here in Austin, called 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[02:32:03.018 --> 02:32:04.478]  And it's a film you need to get.
[02:32:04.518 --> 02:32:07.599]  We have discounts if you get two or more of those videos.
[02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:10.660]  Big discounts if you get three or more of any of my films.
[02:32:11.341 --> 02:32:14.962]  So visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.

[02:32:54.279 --> 02:33:03.504]  The JPFO video, Innocence Portrayed, about what happens when they take your guns, comes with three Second Amendment comic books that are good for adults and children as well.
[02:33:03.944 --> 02:33:06.105]  It's the most professional film I've seen in a long time.
[02:33:06.385 --> 02:33:09.787]  It's $29.95 for the three booklets and the video.

[02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:34.800]  Let's speed through your calls.
[02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:38.741]  I'm going to give you each about a minute or so because I need to get to this clip and some news.
[02:33:39.622 --> 02:33:41.602]  Let's talk to Mike in Colorado.
[02:33:41.622 --> 02:33:42.223]  Thanks for holding.
[02:33:42.243 --> 02:33:42.643]  Go ahead.
[02:33:43.976 --> 02:33:44.276]  Hello.
[02:33:44.856 --> 02:33:51.099]  You had a guest on last, I think it was Friday last week, a psychologist, and you asked him what I thought was a great question that he wasn't really able to answer.
[02:33:51.119 --> 02:33:59.563]  You said, you know, why are they calling, naming drugs Zoma, why are they calling the neighbors fighting on neighbors the Matrix?
[02:34:00.303 --> 02:34:01.904]  Why are they being so obvious with this stuff?
[02:34:01.924 --> 02:34:11.708]  And I think that the answer is that they're using books like 1984 and the Book of Revelations as kind of a script so that people will dismiss
[02:34:12.838 --> 02:34:13.859]  It polarizes people.
[02:34:13.879 --> 02:34:19.161]  It's kind of like the divide and conquer of the left and right when a religious person says, oh my god, it's the end of the world, this is the book of Revelation.
[02:34:19.181 --> 02:34:25.644]  Plus, we tend to accept things that we're already familiar with, even if they're horrible, and so it's a conditioning mechanism.
[02:34:25.784 --> 02:34:27.264]  Yeah, it's supposed to happen that way, right?
[02:34:27.865 --> 02:34:33.387]  Well, I believe in the Bible, but I do also believe the globalists are delusional and are using it as a script.
[02:34:33.807 --> 02:34:34.367]  Right.
[02:34:35.008 --> 02:34:40.250]  And so it's kind of a grand illusion they have that, oh, we're just using it as a script as they follow it.
[02:34:42.646 --> 02:34:43.286]  But I agree with you.
[02:34:43.326 --> 02:34:43.806]  Anything else?
[02:34:44.747 --> 02:34:45.347]  That's it for now.
[02:34:45.707 --> 02:34:46.507]  Thanks, Al.
[02:34:46.527 --> 02:34:48.307]  That was a fabulous point, Fenton.
[02:34:49.668 --> 02:34:54.689]  Yeah, they're using the iconography of fascism and the iconography of state control.
[02:34:55.709 --> 02:34:59.510]  And what they hope to generate is a sheer inevitability factor.
[02:35:00.131 --> 02:35:05.852]  And that was very much in play on 9-11, when the date chosen was such an appropriate date, the date for emergency.
[02:35:06.232 --> 02:35:07.052]  It's an emergency.
[02:35:07.072 --> 02:35:09.113]  The government comes to save you when it's 9-11.
[02:35:10.194 --> 02:35:16.096]  Yeah, but they're conferring inevitability on it, so that you feel, ah, this is all going to happen anyway.
[02:35:16.116 --> 02:35:17.857]  Resistance is futile!
[02:35:17.957 --> 02:35:19.738]  Resistance is futile!
[02:35:21.338 --> 02:35:21.558]  Yeah.
[02:35:22.279 --> 02:35:23.139]  Good point.
[02:35:23.539 --> 02:35:26.900]  They move into that zone then themselves, having created the expectation.
[02:35:27.821 --> 02:35:29.141]  Well, I think it's backfiring on them.
[02:35:29.201 --> 02:35:30.702]  Are you seeing a massive awakening?
[02:35:31.696 --> 02:35:47.260]  I'm definitely seeing an awakening that they are not going to be in control of, and they're playing a dangerous game now as they let some of the truth out of the box with the Michael Moore movie, because that's opening up opportunities for us, but we must capitalize on the opportunity, or they'll roll all over us with their surface-level propaganda.
[02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:48.560]  I agree, well said.
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:50.781]  Eric in Texas, go ahead.
[02:35:51.481 --> 02:35:55.282]  Hey Alex, thanks for your time and all you've done for us.
[02:35:55.562 --> 02:35:56.322]  Well thank you, go ahead.
[02:35:56.622 --> 02:36:01.083]  One way to keep the government from doing things to us is to keep them from taking our money.
[02:36:01.906 --> 02:36:05.728]  You know that most self-tax are illegal, according to the Constitution.
[02:36:06.668 --> 02:36:12.631]  In Article 1 of Section 9, Clause 5, it says, no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.
[02:36:13.151 --> 02:36:26.117]  So to boil that down, if we didn't have a big government, the corporations wouldn't have the enforcement mechanism to run our lives, so we've got to demand that both these political parties cut taxes and restrict government, but that's not happening.
[02:36:26.157 --> 02:36:27.578]  Under Bush, it's exploding!
[02:36:27.958 --> 02:36:28.418]  Exactly.
[02:36:30.675 --> 02:36:32.376]  All right, great points, Eric.
[02:36:32.416 --> 02:36:33.416]  Any comments to that, Fenton?
[02:36:34.197 --> 02:36:42.421]  Yeah, I think we're seeing it's like a return to the Middle Ages here, where they're trying to roll back the Reformation and plunge us back into feudal times with the corporates as the feudal lords.
[02:36:42.901 --> 02:36:44.562]  That's it, global neo-serfdom.
[02:36:45.362 --> 02:36:46.263]  Jesse in Alabama.
[02:36:46.303 --> 02:36:46.983]  Jesse, go ahead.
[02:36:47.403 --> 02:36:47.943]  Hello, Alex.
[02:36:47.983 --> 02:36:49.364]  Long time I hadn't talked to you in a while.
[02:36:50.145 --> 02:36:51.765]  I wanted to expose something real quick.
[02:36:51.785 --> 02:36:55.167]  You were talking about legal psychiatric drugs.
[02:36:56.062 --> 02:37:08.953]  I want to say that the mental health system, the psychiatric drug pushing system, the psychiatrists, which are nothing more than drug pushers, these mental health institutions, that's nothing more than a big
[02:37:09.625 --> 02:37:13.347]  Uh, money-making scam for the drug, uh, for the, uh, drug companies.
[02:37:13.807 --> 02:37:16.208]  At one level, it also brings societal control.
[02:37:16.268 --> 02:37:27.152]  They can't get you in the criminal justice system, or on welfare, they'll declare you mentally ill, and under Bush's new Freedom Initiative, they're gonna test old children, then adults, and force us on new, dangerous anti-psychotics.
[02:37:27.872 --> 02:37:29.353]  Uh, say that again?
[02:37:31.070 --> 02:37:43.017]  It's a program called New Freedom, talking about Orwellian, where they're going to test all children and all adults, and they say at least 15% of us will be forced on not just psychotropics or amphetamine drugs, but on dangerous anti-psychotics.
[02:37:43.777 --> 02:37:47.459]  I'd like to hear more about that, because I didn't know that that was coming down the pipe.
[02:37:47.559 --> 02:37:50.001]  Yeah, I spent three shows on it last week.
[02:37:50.041 --> 02:37:52.162]  I actually have one of the articles here, but I'm going to let you go.
[02:37:52.182 --> 02:37:53.262]  If we have time, I'll get into that.
[02:37:53.643 --> 02:37:55.644]  Fenton, were you aware of the New Freedom Project?
[02:37:56.184 --> 02:38:00.209]  Well yeah, and I tuned into the shows and they were very informative.
[02:38:00.729 --> 02:38:04.733]  And there's no doubt that the drug companies behind the scenes are major players in all of this.
[02:38:05.014 --> 02:38:06.916]  Major players always have been, always will be.
[02:38:07.486 --> 02:38:10.870]  All right, let's go ahead and play six, seven, eight minutes of this.
[02:38:11.050 --> 02:38:13.573]  Try to come back and take a call from John and hit a few news items.
[02:38:13.853 --> 02:38:15.655]  I want to get your take on Fenton Dunn.
[02:38:15.875 --> 02:38:18.938]  But right now, this is starting off with an interview you gave.
[02:38:19.038 --> 02:38:24.224]  People hear 30 minutes of it on your website, but here's five, ten minutes of it with you introducing Sybil Edmonds.
[02:38:24.985 --> 02:38:27.027]  We'll go ahead and put you on hold, Fenton, for a few minutes.
[02:38:27.247 --> 02:38:28.128]  Go ahead and hit that.
[02:38:29.955 --> 02:38:37.840]  It's Monday, the 7th of June, 2004, and this is Fintan Don reporting with a special interview with Cybele Edmonds.
[02:38:38.421 --> 02:38:40.863]  The FBI translator, the U.S.
[02:38:40.943 --> 02:38:42.684]  government, is trying to gag.
[02:38:43.204 --> 02:38:47.407]  You'll get the full Cybele Edmonds story on Break4News.com.
[02:38:47.847 --> 02:38:55.472]  Cybele Edmonds has already given testimony to three separate inquiries instigated and conducted by the U.S.
[02:38:55.512 --> 02:38:59.095]  Houses of Congress, but now Attorney General John Ashcroft
[02:38:59.575 --> 02:39:07.861]  has blocked relatives of the victims of 9-11 from using her information in their legal suit against the Saudi government and others.
[02:39:08.121 --> 02:39:09.282]  The information the U.S.
[02:39:09.322 --> 02:39:23.651]  government is attempting to block indicates that the network of terrorists in the United States who allegedly carried out the 9-11 attacks were deeply enmeshed with criminal networks engaged in drug smuggling and money laundering.
[02:39:23.971 --> 02:39:34.721]  And that these subterranean links were hidden because the FBI had itself been penetrated by an extra-governmental intelligence organization that was blocking the information.
[02:39:35.202 --> 02:39:41.548]  I first asked Sabelle Edmonds about the restrictions which the government's gag order now imposes on her.
[02:39:42.348 --> 02:39:47.093]  Before we turn to the explosive content of the information that you have,
[02:39:47.651 --> 02:39:58.840]  Specifically, the gag order under which you now have to operate means you're precluded from the specifics of the information which you have placed before these investigatory committees.
[02:39:59.421 --> 02:40:04.204]  And now, with this reclassification, they're saying actually I'm precluded to discuss anything.
[02:40:04.625 --> 02:40:07.647]  Including, I can't even say what languages I speak.
[02:40:07.987 --> 02:40:13.092]  I cannot say whether I translated Farsi, Turkish and other by Johnny for the Bureau.
[02:40:13.592 --> 02:40:17.135]  I cannot say whether or not I work for Washington Field Office.
[02:40:17.814 --> 02:40:18.414]  Right.
[02:40:18.534 --> 02:40:22.876]  A lot of that information is in the public domain.
[02:40:22.956 --> 02:40:25.978]  Information which you have ranges across quite a number of areas.
[02:40:46.806 --> 02:40:57.749]  What people have drawn out of the information that you've already put in the public domain prior to the gag order is they've drawn out that there are questions about the effectiveness of the FBI translation, both before and after 9-11.
[02:40:57.949 --> 02:41:03.071]  There is possible penetration of the FBI by a foreign intelligence service, they've concluded from your information.
[02:41:04.071 --> 02:41:11.314]  And that specific intelligence, very specific intelligence, may not have come to light prior to 9-11.
[02:41:11.594 --> 02:41:13.494]  Intelligence which may have prevented the attacks.
[02:41:14.334 --> 02:41:15.835]  That there were criminal networks
[02:41:16.414 --> 02:41:18.338]  Both trafficking drugs and laundering funds.
[02:41:18.839 --> 02:41:20.021]  People will be aware.
[02:41:20.951 --> 02:41:26.034]  Even people who haven't followed these issues closely, as I have, having written about them seven days after 9-11.
[02:41:26.534 --> 02:41:35.180]  But people would be aware that there is some question about whether the FBI had sufficient translation services in place to effectively translate intelligence and help prevent 9-11.
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:47.207]  Your experience of the translation service and its bureaucratic operation and its modus operandi indicate that that's not necessarily true, that there was insufficient translation services available before 9-11.
[02:41:48.806 --> 02:41:52.548]  They were playing the bureaucratic game at your time in the agency.
[02:41:52.788 --> 02:41:57.791]  Let's not be too effective, because if we're very ineffective, they'll give us more money.
[02:41:58.131 --> 02:42:06.735]  And not only that, it was not that they were not aware of certain operations pre 9-11 and after 9-11.
[02:42:07.196 --> 02:42:17.761]  It was also the fact that certain investigations were being quashed, let's say, per State Department's request, because it would have affected certain foreign relations.
[02:42:31.357 --> 02:42:35.738]  Following 9-11 there was a move to strengthen the translation services.
[02:42:35.838 --> 02:42:45.260]  That was the move that brought you into the agency and it was in the course of that that you discovered that there seems to have been deliberate misinterpretation of translated intelligence.
[02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:47.581]  Very specific plots, dates,
[02:42:48.408 --> 02:42:54.153]  And when we say foreign intelligence service, it's also good to know that it is not necessarily governmental foreign intelligence.
[02:43:18.343 --> 02:43:29.070]  Intelligence is also gathered by certain semi-legit organizations to be used for their activities and they have their own intelligence gathering operations.
[02:43:29.650 --> 02:43:46.943]  A lot of these semi-legit organizations with underground activities with certain secrets of certain countries and also money laundering activities are not conducted by governmental agencies and they're conducted by
[02:43:52.302 --> 02:44:03.412]  There hasn't been that degree of finesse of understanding of who the intelligence service may have been in some reports I've seen spotlighting the Israeli Mossad as the organization who was attempting to recruit you.
[02:44:04.439 --> 02:44:09.322]  I have not in state named individuals from, and I have not named countries.
[02:44:09.802 --> 02:44:14.665]  And as I said, I'm mostly speaking about semi-legit organizations here in this country.
[02:44:15.265 --> 02:44:18.807]  And again, this whole game has changed.
[02:44:18.907 --> 02:44:19.968]  It really doesn't...
[02:44:21.028 --> 02:44:25.950]  In as much as you can, Sibel, just explain to me what you mean by this extra-governmental network.
[02:44:51.059 --> 02:45:10.253]  I cannot discuss really specifics, but I have been saying that there are certain points when you have your drug-related activities combined with money laundering and information laundering converging with your terrorist activities.
[02:45:11.024 --> 02:45:27.470]  Therefore to say this investigation is only under counter-intelligence or under criminal and it's not counter-terrorism is absolutely, absolutely deceiving and wrong because there are points that they all converge.
[02:45:28.170 --> 02:45:37.573]  Then you have network of people, people who obtain certain information and they take it out and they sell it to whoever
[02:45:38.322 --> 02:45:38.902]  We're good to go.
[02:46:01.332 --> 02:46:08.597]  Well we know that there is and has been this overlap between criminal activities and U.S.
[02:46:08.677 --> 02:46:11.999]  counterintelligence operations.
[02:46:28.892 --> 02:46:30.833]  That goes back as far as Iran-Contra.
[02:46:31.293 --> 02:46:35.374]  We haven't lost all of the Iran-Contra players along the way.
[02:46:35.414 --> 02:46:40.375]  In fact, if anything, Iran-Contra players seem to have come more to the fore in recent years.
[02:46:40.955 --> 02:46:45.156]  We also have, of course, Richard Armitage as a Deputy Director in the State Department.
[02:46:45.356 --> 02:46:53.178]  Drug money is being rerouted a la Iran-Contra into counter-intelligence operations and illegitimate operations worldwide.
[02:46:53.398 --> 02:46:57.059]  But let's move on, Sebald, to what you did when you
[02:46:57.611 --> 02:46:57.991]  Correct.
[02:46:58.031 --> 02:47:00.433]  Initially, actually, it was friendly warnings and friendly approaches.
[02:47:00.493 --> 02:47:03.775]  I would take it to, let's say, the next level, to FBI, let's say, special agent charge.
[02:47:22.529 --> 02:47:23.630]  Yes, I think so.
[02:47:44.765 --> 02:47:47.307]  Oh, you know, you can have a very good career here.
[02:47:47.767 --> 02:47:57.294]  And actually, one of these individuals brought this application and his commendation letter saying, we would like you to apply for agent positions.
[02:47:58.315 --> 02:48:03.679]  And because of your language abilities and your education background, you would make a good agent.
[02:48:04.338 --> 02:48:11.363]  And it's just, in a way, it's kind of like, well, I am not there to talk about me, I'm there to talk about this issue.
[02:48:12.183 --> 02:48:21.730]  And after I did not back off, and kept going further and further up, it started turning to kind of not-so-friendly warning.
[02:48:22.370 --> 02:48:32.357]  Okay, folks, we'll air some more of this next week, or tomorrow, but then she gets into all the way to Ashcroft, to threatening her, and now she can't talk or she'll be arrested.
[02:48:32.952 --> 02:48:37.861]  We'll come back in a few final news issues with Fenton Dunn and end this great broadcast.
[02:48:38.923 --> 02:48:44.774]  Organized crime in there using the intelligence agencies to protect their operations and the government protecting them.
[02:48:45.794 --> 02:48:47.294]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.454 --> 02:48:50.555]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.675 --> 02:48:54.576]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.616 --> 02:48:58.877]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.217 --> 02:49:02.978]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.078 --> 02:49:04.939]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.519 --> 02:49:08.440]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:13.182]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.342 --> 02:49:16.384]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.564 --> 02:49:19.425]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.925 --> 02:49:26.028]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.568 --> 02:49:30.373]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:49:58.036 --> 02:50:02.558]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.

[02:50:14.543 --> 02:50:21.410]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:21.810 --> 02:50:23.932]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:50:24.432 --> 02:50:29.397]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:51:50.637 --> 02:51:52.537]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:53.017 --> 02:51:55.758]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.370 --> 02:52:01.836]  Alright, England is going to have satellite tracker boxes in all the cars, as we told you years ago.
[02:52:01.896 --> 02:52:02.717]  The London Times.
[02:52:02.737 --> 02:52:04.879]  They're going to do this so you can't speed.
[02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:05.761]  It's for your safety.
[02:52:05.821 --> 02:52:09.786]  Also, a cop who shot Dog fired for flipping off TV camera crew.
[02:52:09.846 --> 02:52:10.587]  Whirled that daily.
[02:52:11.167 --> 02:52:11.928]  Why do I cover this?
[02:52:11.948 --> 02:52:13.210]  Because it just shows the corruption.
[02:52:13.809 --> 02:52:15.670]  He went to the person's house for a burglary call.
[02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:16.670]  The dog was on a leash.
[02:52:16.730 --> 02:52:17.931]  He shot the golden retriever.
[02:52:18.451 --> 02:52:22.593]  Wasn't going to get in trouble for that, but then he flipped the news media off and so he got fired for that.
[02:52:23.213 --> 02:52:24.274]  Interesting little tidbit.
[02:52:24.754 --> 02:52:27.495]  There, another article here out of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
[02:52:29.156 --> 02:52:32.957]  They had a suspect in custody, put a bag over his head and suffocated him to death.
[02:52:33.337 --> 02:52:34.638]  That's their favorite way of torture.
[02:52:34.658 --> 02:52:36.979]  They're claiming it was an accident they put the bag over his head.
[02:52:38.292 --> 02:52:47.700]  I mean, I've got tons of these plans to cancel elections after terror attack, Associated Press, MSN, Money website asks, would you get an RFID chip implanted in your body?
[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:54.826]  Microsoft's MSN Money website is currently running a poll asking readers if they would voluntarily have an RFID tracking chip implanted in their body.
[02:52:55.720 --> 02:53:06.302]  And it goes on to say how popular it is, and how everyone loves it, and why don't you get it, and the stores like it, and Walmart would like to do it, and they're openly talking about putting chips in you.
[02:53:06.782 --> 02:53:17.304]  And by pure coincidence, IBM, the company behind Verichip and the major retailer of the implantable chips, also ran the cataloging system used by the Nazis to store information on Jews in Hitler's Germany.
[02:53:17.704 --> 02:53:23.645]  Something tells me that we should be a tad more concerned about that than who's going to win American Idol.
[02:53:24.205 --> 02:53:30.428]  And then there's another article out of Louisiana with their own matrix system where IBM is running it, a database on all the citizens.
[02:53:30.448 --> 02:53:31.869]  Fenton Dunn, comments.
[02:53:32.709 --> 02:53:42.013]  Well, an interesting development, I thought, was the G8 mission decision to streamline the exchange of information between the G8 countries on air passengers.
[02:53:42.413 --> 02:53:46.795]  So your air passenger traffic information from the USA is going to end up on the computers of the KGB.
[02:53:47.215 --> 02:53:50.477]  They're rolling out the global security information system right now.
[02:53:51.593 --> 02:53:52.194]  Yeah, here it is.
[02:53:52.254 --> 02:54:00.369]  Mississippi deploys new Homeland Security database system with the help from IBM and through $14 million in federal grants in that state alone.
[02:54:01.341 --> 02:54:06.943]  And again with the CAPS 2 system, the trusted traveler, what they're going to make you do, it goes into this grid.
[02:54:07.303 --> 02:54:09.423]  And this is really the world ID card system.
[02:54:09.443 --> 02:54:15.505]  Here's another one, South Florida Sun Sentinel, hand scanners to keep tabs on students at Boca Middle School.
[02:54:15.945 --> 02:54:21.907]  They have to do this when school lunches, when they come to class, and to get into Sea World or Disney World, you've got to do this now.
[02:54:22.347 --> 02:54:25.628]  This will be for the global ID tax, sales tax.
[02:54:25.668 --> 02:54:26.228]  Go ahead, Fenton.
[02:54:27.119 --> 02:54:33.163]  Yeah, I think what's happening as well is that the G8 are being cut loose from the global UN system.
[02:54:33.483 --> 02:54:35.964]  And the G8 are going to spearhead all of these developments.
[02:54:36.124 --> 02:54:38.746]  And then the UN is going to play catch-up later on down the line.
[02:54:38.786 --> 02:54:48.792]  Well, I saw the CFR years ago going, I've got to have a fake bipolar world, so we'll have the G8 and NATO off on its own, and the UN off on its own, kind of competing global order models.
[02:54:49.332 --> 02:54:49.992]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:54:50.173 --> 02:54:54.075]  And with the US as the spearhead bad cop of that G8 maneuver.
[02:54:55.180 --> 02:54:59.444]  Just like we used the Soviets to grab territory before, then they handed over to the bankers.
[02:54:59.844 --> 02:55:01.786]  Yeah.
[02:55:02.166 --> 02:55:05.549]  That's just the country that has the population that's willing to go and do the dying right now.
[02:55:07.391 --> 02:55:07.972]  That's right.
[02:55:08.272 --> 02:55:17.420]  And then the same people that own our media tell us how good the war is here, but the same media owned in Europe is demonizing America, so it's multifaceted.
[02:55:18.635 --> 02:55:26.562]  Yeah, you can see the level of organization and media support for the anti-war demonstrations indicated there was clear top-level support for the anti-American push in Europe.
[02:55:27.462 --> 02:55:29.664]  So we can play the bad cop, they can play the good cop.
[02:55:30.405 --> 02:55:32.687]  But a lot of people are starting to wake up to this shell game.
[02:55:33.668 --> 02:55:34.288]  I think they are.
[02:55:34.648 --> 02:55:43.736]  I think Kerry's candidature was a big wake-up call for a lot of people because they saw skull and bones coming at them from every direction and even the average person is starting to catch on to that right now.
[02:55:44.637 --> 02:55:45.518]  They do have problems.
[02:55:46.018 --> 02:55:52.941]  Well, the CIA is saying that the Iraqis are going to grab a female soldier and cut her head off, so they're already prescripting that.
[02:55:53.261 --> 02:55:57.203]  That ought to get some support behind what they're doing if they start cutting women's heads off.
[02:55:58.424 --> 02:56:00.605]  All of this is a very low-cost way of involving Americans.
[02:56:01.792 --> 02:56:04.953]  And a way to get us all angry, and I guarantee it's the globalist from all the evidence.
[02:56:05.273 --> 02:56:06.934]  Benton Dunn, it was a great two hours with you.
[02:56:06.974 --> 02:56:08.694]  Hope to have you back on next week with some 11s.
[02:56:09.274 --> 02:56:10.295]  Okay, great stuff Alex.
[02:56:10.595 --> 02:56:11.815]  Take care my friend, God bless.
[02:56:12.215 --> 02:56:13.516]  Alright, we're out of time.

[02:56:35.276 --> 02:56:35.877]  Hello folks!
