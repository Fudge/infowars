[00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:06.266]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.927 --> 00:00:08.008]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:09.889]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.309]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.930]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:17.373]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.773 --> 00:00:21.916]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:29.480]  I tell you, my friends, it feels like 30 seconds ago.
[00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:32.242]  It was Monday, but it's not.
[00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.283]  Now it's Thursday.
[00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:38.541]  The 17th day of June, 2004.
[00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:40.983]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:41.043 --> 00:00:43.124]  And boys, there's a lot of important news today.
[00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:47.687]  But frankly, I want to go back to the news from yesterday.
[00:00:48.728 --> 00:00:51.129]  And people all over the place were talking about it on the street.
[00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.191]  Hey Alex, I saw it in the local paper.
[00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:56.773]  Yeah, the brain implant to stop depression.
[00:00:57.654 --> 00:00:58.674]  You talked about that.
[00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:00.656]  Oh yeah, it was the government's plan.
[00:01:01.236 --> 00:01:03.918]  Perhaps we should discuss that some more, but there's a bunch of
[00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:06.382]  Bunch of other really important news.
[00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:07.843]  30 killed in Baghdad.
[00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:09.163]  Suicide blast.
[00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:10.923]  At least 30 people were killed today.
[00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:16.705]  On a suicide car bomb exploded outside an Iraqi Army recruiting center in western Baghdad.
[00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:17.405]  We'll get into that.
[00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:20.885]  Also gearing up to oppress the population.
[00:01:20.905 --> 00:01:22.146]  This is out of a new scientist.
[00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:28.167]  Giant stun guns that blast out a wave of electricity knocking down whole crowds.
[00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:38.280]  You see, non-lethal weapons are really a training aid to prepare the public, the military, and the police to violently, preemptively attack peaceful protesters.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.280]  And then they start taking the gloves off incrementally.
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.601]  There's actually army documents on this as well.
[00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:46.221]  In a few years, it'll be like Tiananmen Square.
[00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:50.062]  They'll just mow us down with .50 caliber machine guns and call it freedom!
[00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:52.222]  It's all part of the love!
[00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:53.222]  You think I'm joking?
[00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:54.803]  It's going to happen if they get their way.
[00:01:55.103 --> 00:01:56.103]  So we'll get into that article.
[00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:02.933]  And then now it's come out, of course, that Rumsfeld ordered the torture specifically, and, oh, Abu Ghraib is nothing!
[00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:04.935]  There's all these secret torture centers!
[00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:05.856]  Uh, yeah?
[00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:13.602]  The CIA bragged years ago they were flying people to third-party countries for vicious torture!
[00:02:13.622 --> 00:02:15.263]  And they torture their children as well!
[00:02:15.743 --> 00:02:23.910]  I know for the Joseph Mingolas out there that love torture, for all the neocons, I'm sure you're quite happy, I for one am certainly not for torture muslets of children!
[00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:31.352]  But again, I'm a liberal, because I'm pro-gun, anti-open border, and against torture.
[00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:39.794]  Again, you're conservative when you're for the government doubling its growth rate, and liberty being destroyed, and assault weapons bans.
[00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:42.034]  Again, you're listening to a very liberal show.
[00:02:42.574 --> 00:02:43.474]  I just work against all that.
[00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:52.636]  Pentagon military hid Iraq prisoners from the Red Cross, and of course we already know about them packing people they beat to death in ice, and putting
[00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.211]  Fake IVs in them and, oh, we're taking him to the hospital!
[00:02:57.251 --> 00:02:58.152]  He had a boo-boo!
[00:02:59.372 --> 00:03:00.093]  All part of the freedom.
[00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:03.654]  Troops to stay in Iraq as long as needed, Wolfowitz said.
[00:03:03.674 --> 00:03:06.896]  Well, yeah, they said before they invaded that we'd be there ten years.
[00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:12.718]  Also, September 11th panel wraps Pentagon air defenses.
[00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:13.839]  That is, criticizes them.
[00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.740]  Now, what happened is they came out yesterday and said,
[00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:22.588]  Well, you know, Bush said that Bin Laden was working for Saddam.
[00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:23.509]  That's not really true.
[00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:24.369]  It was just a mistake.
[00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.970]  Well, everybody already knows that, so now they say that to act like they're credible and put a spin on it.
[00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:33.211]  It's not a very creditable performance, though, I will tell you.
[00:03:34.392 --> 00:03:38.653]  Now they're saying, yeah, air defenses did have a boo-boo that day, but it was all an accident.
[00:03:38.673 --> 00:03:39.513]  They go over why.
[00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:45.195]  If your Cessna goes off course for five minutes, they'll launch F-16s against you over North Dakota or South Texas.
[00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:51.314]  With no real military importance or strategic importance, but the most controlled corridor in the country.
[00:03:51.935 --> 00:04:00.199]  An hour and 24 minutes for the first plane, an hour and 47 minutes for the second plane, and over two hours for the third and fourth planes.
[00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.561]  But let's just ignore all of that.
[00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.883]  The panel has given us all the reasons for this.
[00:04:07.563 --> 00:04:10.825]  Cheney, by the way, won't back down on Saddam's al-Qaeda links.
[00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:12.066]  He just keeps on lying.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.525]  They're saying Al-Qaeda is going to hit us even stronger and the White House says we better give up all our rights.
[00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:23.329]  Meanwhile, there's an article saying, where's all the fear-mongering coming from?
[00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:25.031]  The government never said there was going to be another attack.
[00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:26.953]  It's conspiracy theorists saying it.
[00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:27.553]  Really?
[00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:29.055]  I guess you haven't been reading the newspaper.
[00:04:30.497 --> 00:04:33.418]  And just, folks, so much other news.
[00:04:33.478 --> 00:04:34.598]  I mean, it is legion.
[00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.740]  By the way, we're going to air a segment of that 60 Minutes piece over the weekend that people talked about.
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.080]  It's finally posted on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:45.622]  We're going to air some clips of that here in about 30 minutes on the broadcast as well.
[00:04:46.922 --> 00:04:49.403]  From 60 Minutes, whitewashing Skull & Bones.
[00:04:49.963 --> 00:04:51.824]  And wait until you hear some of the double meanings.
[00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:54.465]  You know, George Bush, born again, Skull & Bones.
[00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:55.945]  They don't tell you what that means.
[00:04:56.065 --> 00:04:56.705]  Born again.
[00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:57.786]  Born again into what?
[00:04:57.866 --> 00:04:58.466]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:02.608]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.748 --> 00:05:05.830]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.853]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.913 --> 00:05:14.156]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.496 --> 00:05:18.278]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.220]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.723]  Police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.763 --> 00:05:28.467]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:31.669]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.772]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.213 --> 00:05:41.318]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.858 --> 00:05:45.640]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.421]  Order your video today.
[00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:48.802]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[00:06:00.268 --> 00:06:06.556]  Maka is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[00:06:06.916 --> 00:06:11.001]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[00:06:11.522 --> 00:06:18.731]  Only recently has science discovered that Maka is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:26.615]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[00:06:26.955 --> 00:06:29.196]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:32.798]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[00:06:33.198 --> 00:06:36.340]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.621]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[00:06:40.062 --> 00:06:42.903]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price
[00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:44.624]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings!

[00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:05.920]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:10.364]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:07:10.644 --> 00:07:11.204]  We listened.
[00:07:11.504 --> 00:07:16.488]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:07:16.768 --> 00:07:17.249]  We listened.
[00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:20.671]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:21.632]  We listened.
[00:07:22.092 --> 00:07:26.154]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:07:26.534 --> 00:07:27.014]  We listened.
[00:07:27.374 --> 00:07:32.596]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:07:33.016 --> 00:07:34.377]  Again, we listened.
[00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:42.120]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.961]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:56.009]  4438.
[00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:56.009]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.132]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:01.454 --> 00:08:07.099]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.802 --> 00:08:15.186]  Alright, coming up later in the show, I'm going to air some clips from a 60 Minutes whitewash.
[00:08:16.346 --> 00:08:17.266]  On Skull and Bones.
[00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:17.806]  What is it?
[00:08:17.866 --> 00:08:21.507]  The third program I've done on Skull and Bones in the last two years.
[00:08:23.068 --> 00:08:31.490]  I remember just five, six years ago being on the radio here locally, on the TV show going over Skull and Bones, how they get in coffins, how they worship Satan.
[00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:36.471]  And now all that's come out in the mainstream news, but they say they're just worshiping Satan for fun.
[00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:38.712]  They're just having a good time.
[00:08:38.732 --> 00:08:40.012]  I mean, they just get in coffins.
[00:08:40.693 --> 00:08:44.554]  Remember up in Long Island a few months ago?
[00:08:44.574 --> 00:08:45.534]  What, about three months ago?
[00:08:47.008 --> 00:08:49.849]  The masons down in this basement blew a guy's head off.
[00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:57.552]  And when the police came in, there were guillotines and black coffins and altars and all this stuff in there.
[00:08:57.632 --> 00:08:58.552]  Goat's heads in there.
[00:08:58.732 --> 00:08:59.953]  You know, Christian stuff.
[00:09:00.713 --> 00:09:04.154]  Again, you're not a Christian if you're not for guillotines, black coffins and goat heads.
[00:09:05.467 --> 00:09:07.772]  But the police said, oh, it was all a complete accident.
[00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:09.375]  They blew this guy's head off in the ritual.
[00:09:09.735 --> 00:09:16.970]  They normally just fire the guns over their heads, you know, as they swear their oath to never expose the higher degrees.
[00:09:19.173 --> 00:09:22.275]  But the stuff going on at Skull and Bones is even better!
[00:09:22.355 --> 00:09:23.556]  It's even more Christian!
[00:09:23.756 --> 00:09:26.518]  Open worship of Satan, mock sacrifices.
[00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:31.402]  Again, I'm a pretty evil person because I believe Satan is not Jesus.
[00:09:32.142 --> 00:09:35.364]  But according to the Christians running the government, Satan is Jesus.
[00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:36.365]  Lucifer is Jesus.
[00:09:36.585 --> 00:09:38.487]  Folks, I'm not playing around here.
[00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:40.608]  And I know a lot of you
[00:09:42.222 --> 00:09:43.443]  You know, don't believe in God.
[00:09:43.503 --> 00:09:50.046]  It's like, well, I mean, I'll be telling people about, you know, skull and bones, Bohemian Grove, and they go, oh, I've heard about that, but I don't really believe in that.
[00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:50.746]  I don't really care.
[00:09:50.787 --> 00:09:51.787]  I go, now, wait a minute.
[00:09:52.247 --> 00:09:56.469]  You mean you don't believe that there's skull and bones in Bohemian Grove and the world leaders attend?
[00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.070]  Oh, no, I know about that.
[00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.151]  I've read the news articles.
[00:10:00.131 --> 00:10:03.753]  But what I mean is I just, you know, I just don't believe in the occult.
[00:10:04.334 --> 00:10:07.835]  And I go, well, even if you don't believe in the occult, crazy people do.
[00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:11.344]  Again, it's just a criminology.
[00:10:11.364 --> 00:10:14.105]  I mean, go take a class in it at college.
[00:10:14.485 --> 00:10:15.925]  Go read a book on it.
[00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:30.130]  Almost every psychopath, in fact, I haven't researched one, and I've read a lot of these crime books, find them interesting, that isn't into the occult, that doesn't have little pentagrams in their closet, who doesn't think they're killing people for the devil.
[00:10:31.593 --> 00:10:32.914]  I mean, this is the norm!
[00:10:33.274 --> 00:10:49.285]  And so we have world leaders doing all of this weird stuff, and then in the real world, carrying out mass evil, bombing innocent people, shutting up police states, garbing the police in black ski masks and black uniforms and black tanks rolling around our streets.
[00:10:49.325 --> 00:10:51.847]  I mean, the manifestation of their worldview!
[00:10:52.607 --> 00:10:55.469]  So just from a sociological or psychological
[00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:02.048]  This view, or you could even say anthropological, just look at it.
[00:11:02.568 --> 00:11:04.430]  I mean, this is the religion of evil people.
[00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.011]  I believe in God.
[00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:06.912]  I believe in the devil.
[00:11:07.573 --> 00:11:09.454]  I've had personal experiences, my friends.
[00:11:10.095 --> 00:11:12.237]  I know what's really going on.
[00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:16.140]  But this is a secular show in that we only cover documented facts.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.243]  So, you have to face it.
[00:11:20.578 --> 00:11:23.099]  And there was a lot of chilling statements in the 60 Minutes piece.
[00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:25.820]  Stuff like, you know, Bush is a born-again bonesman!
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.480]  Ha ha ha!
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.742]  Knowing that 99.8% of people have no idea what that means.
[00:11:30.802 --> 00:11:32.762]  Because they ask Lucifer to enter their body.
[00:11:32.782 --> 00:11:33.383]  This is admitted.
[00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.784]  They are born again into the dark order of war and death.
[00:11:37.044 --> 00:11:42.966]  And they chant, war and death, crush the neophytes, bring us power, oh Satan, Lucifer, our God!
[00:11:45.007 --> 00:11:45.347]  Again!
[00:11:45.407 --> 00:11:48.648]  But this is... I guess if I worship Satan, and I, uh...
[00:11:49.301 --> 00:12:01.144]  You know, chanted to Lucifer, I guess I could, you know, be your president, and you would think I was a Christian, and I could have a 45-foot stone owl in my backyard, and you would trust me with a nuclear football.
[00:12:04.345 --> 00:12:09.366]  I mean, I have so many Christian friends who'll just go, I know about Skull and Bones, I know about Bohemian Grave, oh, they're just having fun.
[00:12:09.786 --> 00:12:15.547]  On the other hand, they know there's a spiritual world, or claim that they know there is, but, but, oh, Bush is just joking!
[00:12:16.128 --> 00:12:17.488]  They're just having fun!
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:25.647]  Anyways, I don't want to get off into this issue now.
[00:12:26.408 --> 00:12:27.830]  It's all coming up, my friends.
[00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.153]  But truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:12:31.253 --> 00:12:38.822]  I mean, they just came out yesterday in literally hundreds of newspapers.
[00:12:39.488 --> 00:12:43.271]  I think we've got like 15 different news articles posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:43.491 --> 00:12:45.413]  There's a whole bunch on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:45.753 --> 00:12:55.061]  Where, oh, for depression, you know, we hook these wires in the nerves into your brain, and you know, and well, and then the government says they're going to force us to do this.
[00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:56.643]  They said five years ago.
[00:12:56.683 --> 00:13:02.748]  They said two years ago that they were going to force us to do this in their own reports, and here they are promoting it and selling it.
[00:13:02.768 --> 00:13:04.069]  You don't need Prozac anymore.
[00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:07.772]  We'll just make you a wirehead, as Philip K. Dick would say.
[00:13:11.863 --> 00:13:13.623]  And again, I'm the weirdo for reporting on.
[00:13:15.364 --> 00:13:17.164]  I'm the weirdo for saying it's a bad idea.
[00:13:17.364 --> 00:13:19.745]  I'm the weirdo for beforehand warning you.
[00:13:22.365 --> 00:13:23.886]  This is the reality, my friends.
[00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:27.807]  Look at this article out of the New Scientist.
[00:13:29.647 --> 00:13:31.948]  Now, the government's been developing this for a long time.
[00:13:32.488 --> 00:13:41.290]  My grandfather, back in the sixties, lived next door to a successful inventor, and they worked together.
[00:13:42.125 --> 00:14:05.423]  As partners, on a remote control, you'd call it, you know, kind of a primitive robot on treads, would roll down the street, and it'd have these long poles sticking out from it that were telescoping to go, you know, to be as wide as any street, and they would shoot out, you know, basically little lightning bolts to knock down whole crowds.
[00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:13.857]  And they basically just got their money back on it because the Pentagon just bought the prototype and then basically made their own later out of it.
[00:14:14.978 --> 00:14:16.980]  And they never got the big military contracts.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.604]  So that's how long I know personally this has been going on.
[00:14:21.124 --> 00:14:22.646]  Well this is out of the New Scientist.
[00:14:23.566 --> 00:14:26.349]  Sweeping stun guns to target crowds.
[00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.254]  And this is the June 17th New Scientist article.
[00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:43.643]  Weapons that can incapacitate crowds of people by sweeping a lightning-like beam of electricity across them are being readied for sale to military and police forces in the U.S.
[00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:44.084]  and Europe.
[00:14:47.306 --> 00:14:52.109]  And they've got them that mount on armored vehicles, they've got them that roll down the street that are remote control, they've got them all.
[00:14:53.428 --> 00:14:58.112]  And it says, a present commercial stun guns target one person at a time and work only at close quarters.
[00:14:58.193 --> 00:15:07.821]  The new breed of non-lethal weapons, what they actually call in the industry, less lethal, can be used on many people at once and operates over far greater distances.
[00:15:09.683 --> 00:15:18.111]  But human rights groups are appalled by the fact that no independent safety tests have been carried out and by their potential for indiscriminate use.
[00:15:18.271 --> 00:15:19.172]  Well, that's the whole point.
[00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:27.764]  The weapons are designed to address the perceived shortcomings of the Taser, the electric shotgun already used by 4,000 police departments in the U.S.
[00:15:27.804 --> 00:15:30.845]  undergoing trials with some police forces in the U.K.
[00:15:35.387 --> 00:15:45.391]  They also then get into what DARPA is developing and some of the other systems they want to use.
[00:15:46.776 --> 00:15:55.245]  The Sunshine Project reported two years ago that every major city's got helicopters and hangars with knockout gas ready on the paths to knock out whole cities.
[00:15:56.005 --> 00:15:59.229]  The Russians gassed the theater with this and what, it killed a third of the people?
[00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:05.375]  The terrorists only killed like five people, but the gas killed a third of the, over what, 118 people?
[00:16:06.796 --> 00:16:10.500]  And they say that if they hit a population with this gas and they spray a city with it,
[00:16:11.098 --> 00:16:12.439]  That it will kill tens of thousands.
[00:16:12.599 --> 00:16:21.742]  Automobile accidents, fires, you know, all the ovens that were on, all the steaks being grilled, all the stuff that'll happen.
[00:16:23.202 --> 00:16:30.005]  But no, they got the helicopters ready just sitting there with the knockout gas for you and your family, because we're in such a free society.
[00:16:31.666 --> 00:16:38.148]  But I remember reading, you know, years ago, the reports that, oh, this is to train the military and the police to engage the public.
[00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:46.670]  It's hard to get troops to run out in their Darth Vader outfits and start machine-gunning people unless you know you've been trained in Communist China how to do it in Tiananmen Square.
[00:16:47.371 --> 00:17:05.794]  But through rubber bullets, wooden dowels, beanbags, giant tankards of backpack spray nozzles of pepper spray and mace, big tankards the size of a large or small
[00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:07.789]  Fire extinguisher.
[00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:09.650]  And we have all the video on the website.
[00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:10.730]  We have it in the takeover.
[00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.050]  Just people peacefully protesting on the sidewalk.
[00:17:14.371 --> 00:17:16.591]  Police running up, savagely stomping on women.
[00:17:17.351 --> 00:17:18.871]  Breaking bones with pleasure.
[00:17:19.352 --> 00:17:22.952]  Spraying them with pepper spray at point-blank range.
[00:17:23.632 --> 00:17:24.913]  Randomly stopping traffic.
[00:17:25.193 --> 00:17:27.613]  Ordering people to roll down their windows and spraying their cars.
[00:17:27.633 --> 00:17:31.294]  I mean, it's just... It's like you train a puppy.
[00:17:31.934 --> 00:17:35.855]  You know, a baby pit bull on a dummy.
[00:17:36.804 --> 00:17:40.267]  Or, you know, train them how to bite, train them how to attack.
[00:17:40.587 --> 00:17:42.169]  And the government says that's what this is all about.
[00:17:42.229 --> 00:17:52.079]  And see, the non-lethal weapons, which are really called less than lethal, get more and more vicious, more and more aggressive, and this is the new America.
[00:17:52.099 --> 00:17:55.283]  Remember what happened in Miami last year?
[00:17:56.243 --> 00:18:07.885]  I mean, federal judges, AP reporters, they would march World War II vets, totally peaceful protest, down a side alley, come with us and beat them savagely, saying you shouldn't come out here and protest.
[00:18:08.085 --> 00:18:12.206]  They got in some trouble because it was federal judges and AP reporters.
[00:18:13.667 --> 00:18:15.227]  It did cause them some bad publicity.
[00:18:15.567 --> 00:18:19.948]  But they would march them down a side street and beat the living daylights out of them, you know, World War II vets and people.
[00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:27.593]  And in Portland, you know, there's a video of them spraying babies in the faces, and the parents were crying back, and they'd say, shouldn't bring a baby.
[00:18:28.454 --> 00:18:29.335]  It's real funny.
[00:18:29.916 --> 00:18:30.456]  It's fun.
[00:18:30.917 --> 00:18:32.779]  So they're training them on blood.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.926]  They're training them to be sick to us, and then later they say, okay, here's a machine gun.
[00:18:39.136 --> 00:18:52.385]  And they're now giving them the sound wave rifles that can actually kill you, and the microwave guns that if they turn them on high can kill you, and a lot of big police departments now have the quiet Humvees with the giant microwave guns mounted on them, ready to be rolled out against us.
[00:18:52.445 --> 00:18:53.446]  It's just all part of freedom.
[00:18:53.906 --> 00:19:00.811]  What is it the government's planning that's so horrible they know there's going to be rallies of millions of people, not hundreds of thousands or thousands?
[00:19:02.192 --> 00:19:08.657]  You see, the IMF and World Bank, two and a half years ago, when Joseph Siklitz quit their chief economist, and these thousands of pages of documents suddenly surfaced,
[00:19:10.009 --> 00:19:18.791]  The actual documents of how the IMF and World Bank like to create riots, like to create problems, and they get to crack down on how they're funding the internal militarization of police.
[00:19:19.652 --> 00:19:22.692]  Folks, we're all just being inducted into slavery right now.
[00:19:25.033 --> 00:19:35.135]  And so they've issued the federal ringwraith Darth Vader outfits to all the police departments, and even small police departments are basically armed camps, and we're the enemy!
[00:19:35.796 --> 00:19:36.456]  You know, they've got to
[00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:40.001]  Watch us and keep control of us because we're dangerous.
[00:19:41.022 --> 00:19:42.764]  When we get back, we'll get into the Pentagon.
[00:19:44.405 --> 00:19:45.687]  It's not just Abu Ghraib.
[00:19:45.747 --> 00:19:48.349]  It's secret detainees being tortured to death.
[00:19:50.051 --> 00:19:51.712]  But again, torturing people to death?
[00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.394]  I mean, isn't that why we fought Hitler?
[00:19:53.434 --> 00:19:54.735]  Because he wouldn't torture people to death?
[00:19:55.656 --> 00:19:57.038]  You know, the good guys tortured to death.
[00:19:57.078 --> 00:19:57.878]  Hitler wouldn't do that.
[00:19:57.939 --> 00:19:59.300]  Oh, actually, he did do that, didn't he?
[00:20:01.787 --> 00:20:02.767]  It's finally here!
[00:20:02.907 --> 00:20:03.888]  Spring has arrived!
[00:20:04.088 --> 00:20:07.048]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:20:07.268 --> 00:20:10.729]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:20:10.929 --> 00:20:19.091]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:05.150]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:22:05.371 --> 00:22:17.655]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:22:18.095 --> 00:22:18.495]  The U.S.
[00:22:18.535 --> 00:22:24.117]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:22:24.518 --> 00:22:26.718]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:22:28.599 --> 00:22:29.639]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:22:29.679 --> 00:22:32.520]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:38.662]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:22:39.103 --> 00:22:42.444]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[00:23:07.898 --> 00:23:08.719]  Read the labels.
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:13.284]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:13.504 --> 00:23:17.688]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:22.934]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[00:23:50.448 --> 00:23:51.888]  Alright folks, just a brief synopsis.
[00:23:51.908 --> 00:23:54.308]  Our government has trained the world how to torture publicly.
[00:24:16.084 --> 00:24:25.226]  An entire university in Fort Benning, Georgia, how to hook electrodes to people's genitalia, how to torture people's children in front of them.
[00:24:25.286 --> 00:24:26.067]  This is the freedom!
[00:24:27.807 --> 00:24:30.068]  And I thought it was bad, but it's supposedly good.
[00:24:30.628 --> 00:24:35.929]  Now they want to come out of the closet with it and condition you that it's a good thing so they can use it on the general public.
[00:24:36.576 --> 00:24:48.181]  And then they tested on a minority group in Iraq psychologically to again to prepare your minds to accept it here domestically and meanwhile the law enforcement magazines are saying this would be a good thing to use on common suspected criminals.
[00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:59.585]  And then they came out and said they were torturing people in Afghanistan and torturing people in Iraq and how good it was and how wonderful it was and you saw it on the news and read the editorials and we covered it and I put it in my three last films.
[00:25:00.385 --> 00:25:01.686]  And then we got some images of it!
[00:25:02.671 --> 00:25:08.556]  Images they decided to release for some reason, and then suddenly we get the Murr getting his head cut off, and somehow that legitimizes all of it.
[00:25:09.417 --> 00:25:13.020]  But then they try to deny simultaneously that the government ever ordered it.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:23.369]  Of course the memos from the Justice Department and from the Defense Department are all public, and they said the government's above the law, and now the Associated Press is reporting that this is an impeachable offense.
[00:25:23.389 --> 00:25:29.474]  The President saying he's above federal law, but maybe they're traitors, maybe they're with Al Qaeda, maybe they should be tortured.
[00:25:29.918 --> 00:25:32.119]  You know, I mean, maybe this is really freedom, you know?
[00:25:32.699 --> 00:25:33.479]  Just keeping you safe.
[00:25:33.539 --> 00:25:36.520]  I mean, you know, folks that want to torture certainly wouldn't carry out 9-11.
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.941]  I mean, these are nice people.
[00:25:37.961 --> 00:25:39.421]  They're just Skull and Bones members, after all.
[00:25:40.102 --> 00:25:44.683]  Uh, Rumsfeld ordered Iraq prisoners held in secret.
[00:25:44.723 --> 00:25:49.805]  Pentagon officials say Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ordered an Iraq terror suspect, and they always give you one.
[00:25:50.245 --> 00:25:58.568]  They have 32 known camps and hundreds of other camps we're now learning of, to be held in secret location, hidden away from the International Committee on the Red Cross and others.
[00:25:59.701 --> 00:26:12.644]  Officials say Mr. Rumsfeld, acting on request of the CIA Director, George Tenet, ordered the suspected senior member of the terror group, Ansar al-Islam, to be secretly held in solitary confinement at a military prison near Baghdad.
[00:26:13.765 --> 00:26:15.485]  And the man had been held in prison for seven months.
[00:26:15.545 --> 00:26:16.005]  A recent U.S.
[00:26:16.025 --> 00:26:21.446]  military report described efforts to hold prisoners in secret as deceptive and a violation of international law.
[00:26:22.287 --> 00:26:22.587]  I don't know.
[00:26:22.627 --> 00:26:24.827]  I mean, the Russians secretly grabbed people and held them.
[00:26:24.847 --> 00:26:25.787]  I mean, they were terrorists.
[00:26:25.867 --> 00:26:27.108]  I mean, this is what they do in China.
[00:26:27.428 --> 00:26:28.128]  Fidel does it.
[00:26:28.957 --> 00:26:31.338]  Our government in the fifties said that he was like Abe Lincoln.
[00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:35.881]  Defense Department officials say the man will soon be assigned an identification number.
[00:26:36.321 --> 00:26:41.824]  Then we've got articles here where the prisoners die in these secret prisons, but I guess that's freedom.
[00:26:43.785 --> 00:26:50.889]  And a spokesman says that an Iraqi has been held since October without an ID number and just goes into that.
[00:26:50.949 --> 00:26:55.272]  So whenever they get caught doing this, they'll tell you about some tiny piece of it and focus in on that.
[00:26:56.312 --> 00:26:59.253]  And, uh, Reuters is also, uh, reporting, uh, on it.
[00:26:59.934 --> 00:27:08.837]  And, uh, very, very interesting, but again, the Associated Press is saying that Bush could be impeached over saying they're above the law and are allowed to torture.
[00:27:09.738 --> 00:27:12.439]  So, which federal laws is Bush above?
[00:27:13.099 --> 00:27:19.542]  I guess the ones that say Enron can't be run out of the Vice President's office with no bids allowed, all the money going directly to them?
[00:27:19.562 --> 00:27:24.024]  I guess that type of open, incredible, mafioso fraud crime?
[00:27:24.824 --> 00:27:26.864]  Embezzlement?
[00:27:27.044 --> 00:27:28.525]  I guess you're above it all, aren't you?
[00:27:28.545 --> 00:27:30.345]  I guess you can do whatever you want.
[00:27:33.046 --> 00:27:36.466]  But troops do stay in Iraq as long as needed, Wolfowitz says.
[00:27:36.566 --> 00:27:36.746]  U.S.
[00:27:36.766 --> 00:27:46.268]  troops will remain in Iraq as long as necessary until Iraqi forces can handle security on their own, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Thursday during a visit to northern Iraq.
[00:27:46.288 --> 00:27:51.029]  The role of the coalition forces after July 1st is to support the Iraq security forces as much as they need help
[00:27:51.932 --> 00:27:59.438]  From sometime to come, they will need some substantial help and help them is the mission that we would like to carry out.
[00:28:00.198 --> 00:28:02.740]  And they've actually increased our troops.
[00:28:03.441 --> 00:28:08.965]  At first it was from 120-something thousand to 144,000, 145,000, now it's 150,000, now 160,000.
[00:28:09.445 --> 00:28:13.088]  So we're actually increasing the troop level.
[00:28:13.128 --> 00:28:16.230]  This is all part of the handover of freedom to the appointed government.
[00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.431]  And again, an appointed government
[00:28:18.498 --> 00:28:22.400]  Is not freedom, but again, I guess that's because I might be Al-Qaeda-ish.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.401]  You know, I'm actually for people being elected, but that's Al-Qaeda-ish.
[00:28:26.602 --> 00:28:28.402]  Freedom is Al-Qaeda-ish.
[00:28:29.063 --> 00:28:34.365]  Two days ago at the TV station, I was told by an old friend again that I should be arrested for saying the government's behind 9-11.
[00:28:34.905 --> 00:28:46.190]  That's sedition, and this thought has gotten out there now, and criticizing the government, pointing out what they've done is Al-Qaeda-ish, and not submitting and loving tyranny is Al-Qaeda-ish.
[00:28:47.819 --> 00:28:53.886]  Because, again, any criticism of the state aids the terrorist, and so that is, hence, al-Qaeda-ish.
[00:28:54.687 --> 00:28:56.169]  By the way, I'm not being sarcastic, folks.
[00:28:56.189 --> 00:28:57.751]  It's actually up to that point now.
[00:28:58.772 --> 00:29:06.081]  Interestingly enough, a September 11th panel criticizes Pentagon air defense, but they really didn't do that concerning the scandal of 9-11.
[00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:06.882]  We'll get into that.
[00:29:08.536 --> 00:29:12.580]  And, uh, again, the Feds are saying Al-Qaeda is sure to hit us any minute.
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.403]  Meanwhile, the Business Times comes out and says, the Fed doesn't have news.
[00:29:16.423 --> 00:29:18.585]  Another September 11th attack does it!
[00:29:19.346 --> 00:29:22.709]  And then goes into so-called conspiracy theories that have hit the mainstream.
[00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:26.252]  Also, a new anti-hate net conference opens up.
[00:29:27.033 --> 00:29:27.573]  Oh, yes!
[00:29:28.414 --> 00:29:30.556]  And it's not just racist talk that won't be allowed.
[00:29:30.636 --> 00:29:32.137]  Oh, no, it's criticism of the government.
[00:29:32.177 --> 00:29:33.859]  Because, again, that AIDS terrorist.
[00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:37.780]  And more incriminating Enron tapes, but that's okay.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.521]  The Feds have ordered California that was ripped off by Enron to pay even more money to Enron.
[00:29:43.021 --> 00:29:44.481]  That'll certainly punish Enron.
[00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:47.202]  Again, it's all coming up.
[00:29:47.442 --> 00:29:47.942]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:52.543]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.003 --> 00:29:54.603]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.523 --> 00:29:58.204]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.539 --> 00:30:07.763]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:30:07.903 --> 00:30:14.068]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:30:14.348 --> 00:30:22.794]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:30:23.034 --> 00:30:30.059]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:30:30.359 --> 00:30:35.182]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:30:35.402 --> 00:30:40.786]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:30:41.146 --> 00:30:44.228]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:30:44.569 --> 00:30:52.534]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:52.574 --> 00:30:53.154]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:01.428 --> 00:31:02.748]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[00:31:02.929 --> 00:31:06.690]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck, too.
[00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:10.571]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[00:31:10.871 --> 00:31:14.492]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[00:31:14.732 --> 00:31:19.153]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[00:31:19.474 --> 00:31:23.295]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[00:31:23.515 --> 00:31:24.235]  It really works!
[00:31:24.495 --> 00:31:30.597]  NT Oil Additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[00:31:30.877 --> 00:31:32.017]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[00:31:32.277 --> 00:31:34.818]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[00:31:34.978 --> 00:31:38.239]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps, and air tools.
[00:31:38.439 --> 00:31:43.501]  Gearboxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[00:31:43.681 --> 00:31:45.121]  Diesel engines thrive on it, too.
[00:31:45.302 --> 00:31:49.403]  To place your order, call King Oil Company at 800-647-4079.
[00:31:50.263 --> 00:31:51.583]  We accept MasterCard and Visa.
[00:31:51.603 --> 00:31:56.385]  The order department is open from 8 to 5 Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, and on Saturday until noon.
[00:31:56.565 --> 00:31:56.825]  That's 800-647-4079.
[00:32:01.038 --> 00:32:04.742]  The grass is always greener with a wheatgrass kit from wheatgrasskits.com.

[00:32:16.295 --> 00:32:18.137]  It's easy to do indoors or out.
[00:32:18.417 --> 00:32:19.819]  Start with a basic wheatgrass kit.
[00:32:20.019 --> 00:32:23.442]  It's everything you'll need to grow stamina-building, nutrient-rich wheatgrass.
[00:32:23.722 --> 00:32:31.870]  The kit includes 5 pounds of organic wheatgrass seed, reusable growing trays, organic soil, mineral additive, and the book, Wheatgrass, Nature's Finest Miracle.
[00:32:32.091 --> 00:32:35.514]  Or get the deluxe kit that adds barley, grass seed, and sunflower greens.
[00:32:35.754 --> 00:32:40.679]  The health benefits of wheatgrass are legendary, but perhaps one of the best benefits are the antioxidants.
[00:32:40.939 --> 00:32:44.360]  Research is showing that antioxidants are instrumental in preventing cancer.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:49.581]  At wheatgrasskits.com you'll find the best available price on a huge variety of wheatgrass juicers.

[00:32:53.042 --> 00:32:57.023]  Visit today www.wheatgrasskits.com or call 801-375-2250.
[00:33:06.357 --> 00:33:08.259]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.563]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.545 --> 00:33:16.088]  All right, 33 minutes into this first hour.
[00:33:16.128 --> 00:33:18.731]  Thank you for joining us on this live Thursday edition.
[00:33:19.884 --> 00:33:22.446]  Your calls are coming up at 800-259-9231.
[00:33:22.486 --> 00:33:28.351]  A lot of brain chip implant news will be going over.
[00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:30.573]  A lot of news about Homeland Security.
[00:33:30.713 --> 00:33:33.755]  Oh, all those cameras you thought were for traffic that they told you about?
[00:33:34.436 --> 00:33:36.177]  Oh, those are for Homeland Security.
[00:33:36.397 --> 00:33:38.179]  Of course they are, to keep you safe.
[00:33:38.886 --> 00:33:50.229]  And just a plethora of incredible news discussions now, even in the Associated Press, of impeachment of George Bush, adding a lot of validity to the rumblings that that's been going on behind the scenes.
[00:33:51.045 --> 00:34:08.239]  So that's coming up as well, and here in a few minutes, I'm going to air this five-minute clip from Sixteen Minutes, a chilling clip where they kind of whitewash Skull and Bones, but there's some interesting hidden meanings in it for the initiated in the New World Order, where they're laughing basically at the dumbed-down public.
[00:34:08.619 --> 00:34:09.400]  So that's coming up.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:17.306]  We're also about, in just a few minutes, to have an update from Joyce Riley to explain to you what American Candidate is on the Showtime cable network.
[00:34:18.237 --> 00:34:26.668]  She's one of the ten contestants on this big reality show, and it's a great platform, and a lot of listeners are confused about what it is, so we're going to briefly, with her, we're honored to have her on, talk about that.
[00:34:26.708 --> 00:34:30.253]  But before we do that, my friends, look, it's real simple.
[00:34:32.003 --> 00:34:33.984]  We have to wake America and the world up.
[00:34:34.084 --> 00:34:35.025]  We have the tools.
[00:34:35.125 --> 00:34:37.367]  We have the facts to give people the big picture.
[00:34:37.907 --> 00:34:50.115]  And if you won't take action, if you won't step up to the plate, if you won't get up here in the trenches with us, if you won't wake your neighbors, your friends, your family, your local opinion makers up, it's over.
[00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:52.696]  A lot of people are fighting, standing up.
[00:34:52.716 --> 00:34:56.099]  There's a huge awakening taking place, but it's not happening fast enough.
[00:34:56.859 --> 00:34:59.581]  And my friends, frankly, my videos are the best tools I've found.
[00:35:00.396 --> 00:35:04.219]  The most hard-hitting, focused, full-spectrum films out there.
[00:35:04.479 --> 00:35:06.501]  We don't just cover one issue and obsess on that.
[00:35:06.881 --> 00:35:09.583]  We cover the full spectrum of government-sponsored terror.
[00:35:09.923 --> 00:35:14.827]  How governments carry out terror attacks to blame it on their enemies, domestically or overseas.
[00:35:14.847 --> 00:35:17.669]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[00:35:18.009 --> 00:35:19.611]  Both those films are about September 11th.
[00:35:20.959 --> 00:35:26.522]  Police state three total enslavement gets into dozens of examples of government-sponsored terror that we didn't cover in the other films.
[00:35:26.822 --> 00:35:31.244]  Confirmed admitted cases in the last hundred years where the governments of the world have done this.
[00:35:31.825 --> 00:35:34.966]  And then we get into the Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security.
[00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:39.689]  We get into the RFID tracker chips, the implantable chips.
[00:35:40.539 --> 00:35:46.243]  The surveillance grid, the government run white slavery rings, gun control.
[00:35:46.304 --> 00:35:47.705]  I mean, it's a turd of force.
[00:35:47.765 --> 00:35:49.266]  Police state three total enslavement.
[00:35:49.446 --> 00:35:51.047]  There's really three or four films in one.
[00:35:51.387 --> 00:35:53.489]  It's two hours, 44 minutes long.
[00:35:53.529 --> 00:35:54.730]  We even get into building seven.
[00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:56.231]  Now they brought that down in the film.
[00:35:57.521 --> 00:35:59.082]  So you need to get the videos.
[00:35:59.122 --> 00:36:04.464]  Matrix of Evil is my newest video with Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Frank Morales, Colonel Craig Roberts, myself.
[00:36:04.484 --> 00:36:07.425]  It's a video of us throwing the Patriot Act out here in Austin.
[00:36:07.745 --> 00:36:09.046]  How you can do that in your area.
[00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:09.846]  It's a great video.
[00:36:10.066 --> 00:36:13.728]  They're all over 2 hours long, $25.95 apiece.
[00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:17.209]  $20 when you order 3 or more of any of the 10 films I've produced.
[00:36:17.649 --> 00:36:22.412]  I also carry other great videos and books concerning 9-11 and other New World Order issues.
[00:36:22.712 --> 00:36:34.999]  So visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, peruse the Secure Safe Shopping Card, watch the free video clips of the films on the sites, and order them, because we also, secondarily, need your support!
[00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:37.681]  But number one, it's about getting the word out.
[00:36:38.041 --> 00:36:40.103]  You can also call toll free to get my videos.
[00:36:40.183 --> 00:36:41.564]  Big discounts when you order three or more.
[00:36:41.584 --> 00:36:41.684]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:41.724 --> 00:36:42.785]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:36:42.805 --> 00:36:47.088]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:37:05.618 --> 00:37:09.301]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[00:37:10.221 --> 00:37:13.444]  I mean, our conscience says that we need to expose the murderers of 9-11.
[00:37:14.504 --> 00:37:16.526]  And it's not going to happen through Michael Moore, folks.
[00:37:16.566 --> 00:37:20.108]  I'm sorry, he only tells you 2% of the story and then gives you false solutions.
[00:37:20.448 --> 00:37:22.850]  We give you 100% of it, the big picture.
[00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.853]  Get the videos, make copies, spread the word today.
[00:37:27.757 --> 00:37:38.102]  All right, let's go to Captain Joyce Riley to explain what American Candidate is and to give us an update and how folks can help her win this and why it's important that she win this.
[00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:43.984]  And then we'll, in a few minutes, get to the 60 Minutes piece and then we'll go right to your calls for those of you holding in more news.
[00:37:44.284 --> 00:37:45.425]  Joyce, great to have you on.
[00:37:45.445 --> 00:37:47.026]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:37:47.286 --> 00:37:49.927]  I appreciate the opportunity to tell you what I'm doing.
[00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:54.209]  I know there are a lot of people that are saying, what is this thing all about that she's doing?
[00:37:54.269 --> 00:37:56.090]  Why has she gone from the radio show?
[00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.010]  Why isn't she there?
[00:37:57.677 --> 00:37:59.138]  Well, here's what it's all about.
[00:37:59.338 --> 00:38:18.815]  American Candidate is a program that basically started out with about 2,000 people, that we learned, is now down, was narrowed down to 24, then down to about 12, of people who say that they believe that if they were President of the United States, they would have an answer.
[00:38:19.376 --> 00:38:23.139]  So everybody that is running, all of these people, have a different answer.
[00:38:23.686 --> 00:38:43.239]  But we want to get in front of the American public to say, we don't like the answers that are already out there, we don't like either party that's running, and obviously it's got to be either a libertarian, constitutionalist party, which is my particular choice at this point, because what we're seeing out there is absolutely abysmal.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:51.905]  Well, ten people are, narrowed down from twelve to ten, are, and we can't tell how many people are left right now, but are in this competition.
[00:38:52.648 --> 00:38:57.330]  They narrow it down by dropping you into a town and basically saying, go find both.
[00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:58.551]  Go find supporters.
[00:38:59.251 --> 00:39:02.792]  And a lot of people have email lists that are attached to certain types of groups.
[00:39:03.773 --> 00:39:05.353]  Like one of the gentlemen is with PETA.
[00:39:05.514 --> 00:39:07.334]  So he has a lot of supporters.
[00:39:07.374 --> 00:39:09.455]  They may have 30,000 on their email list.
[00:39:09.855 --> 00:39:12.497]  Well, they get that out, and that's what circulates both.
[00:39:12.897 --> 00:39:16.958]  Yeah, but still, Joyce, I mean, you're dynamic, you're intelligent, you're informed.
[00:39:16.978 --> 00:39:20.320]  And I saw some of the bozos, I don't mean to be mean, that you're up against.
[00:39:21.105 --> 00:39:26.690]  And if they really counted according to votes and who gets the most people out, you're probably going to win this.
[00:39:27.171 --> 00:39:28.152]  Well, I don't know.
[00:39:28.472 --> 00:39:29.713]  Because they've got a lot of connections.
[00:39:29.773 --> 00:39:30.874]  People have a lot of connections.
[00:39:30.974 --> 00:39:32.135]  It's like real politics.
[00:39:32.836 --> 00:39:34.117]  But let me tell you, though.
[00:39:34.297 --> 00:39:37.080]  I've gotten to know every one of them, Alex, and they're incredible people.
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.602]  Well, I'm not trying to be mean, but I don't agree with the PETA guy.
[00:39:40.363 --> 00:39:40.964]  I'll tell you right now.
[00:39:40.984 --> 00:39:41.904]  He may have a lot of connections.
[00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:53.382]  And then the person that wins, or through this process, they're shooting it all now, it'll be in how many episodes on Showtime?
[00:39:53.963 --> 00:39:55.844]  There's going to be 10 episodes on Showtime.
[00:39:55.924 --> 00:40:04.470]  Okay, well that's a big deal and then out of that you'll be able to get out the real ideas and people will be able to see what the grassroots from a diverse crowd really wants.
[00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:05.650]  That's why I think this is important.
[00:40:06.111 --> 00:40:06.831]  It really is.
[00:40:07.251 --> 00:40:08.092]  It's our chance.
[00:40:08.512 --> 00:40:13.776]  Now as I understand it, Showtime is the only network that would take this program because it was so politically charged.
[00:40:14.355 --> 00:40:18.516]  You can imagine when you've got ten free spirits up there that are all saying what they believe in.
[00:40:18.696 --> 00:40:21.177]  But Joyce, Joyce, I hate to keep interrupting you, you know I'm the master of that.
[00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:26.918]  Explain to me, does this really work off how many votes you get in each town?
[00:40:27.478 --> 00:40:27.658]  Yes.
[00:40:28.078 --> 00:40:37.060]  Okay, so it's not like these other reality shows where it's groupthink and they go after the strongest people first because if that was the case you would be the first to be kicked out.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.681]  That's why I don't like these shows like Survivor and the rest of them.
[00:40:40.213 --> 00:40:46.374]  Well, you know, it's interesting because we all talked about this, and we said, now wait a minute, are we going to knock off the person that we think would be the biggest threat to us?
[00:40:46.874 --> 00:40:48.915]  Or are we going to vote for the person we really want?
[00:40:49.495 --> 00:40:56.316]  And here is the bottom line, is that I want the American candidate, whoever it's going to be, to be the absolute best person.
[00:40:56.636 --> 00:40:57.877]  Not a personality contest.
[00:40:58.217 --> 00:41:01.417]  If they think I need to go, and I'm not the strongest, then I need to go.
[00:41:01.457 --> 00:41:03.718]  Well, Joyce, can you tell us about some of the other candidates?
[00:41:03.818 --> 00:41:05.018]  I mean, I'm just curious about them.
[00:41:05.558 --> 00:41:08.519]  Yes, um, there is a, um,
[00:41:10.171 --> 00:41:14.835]  The gentleman that's from PETA, and all these candidates are on the internet.
[00:41:15.596 --> 00:41:19.118]  There's one who represents the very liberal side.
[00:41:19.398 --> 00:41:24.102]  I won't tell you what the names are or whatever, but somebody that represents the very liberal side of the Democratic Party.
[00:41:24.122 --> 00:41:26.103]  Yeah, that's a good campaign tactic, okay.
[00:41:26.223 --> 00:41:28.165]  Who is a very strong Kerry supporter.
[00:41:28.725 --> 00:41:36.111]  There is a gentleman who is black and gay, who is basically the first person ever to come out openly like that and run.
[00:41:36.687 --> 00:41:47.062]  There is a, let me think, there is a, they call him the closet Republican, but there is a Republican who is very much for those issues.
[00:41:47.322 --> 00:41:50.567]  Why are they even in this then if it's supposed to be alternative?
[00:41:50.587 --> 00:41:52.169]  Sounds like a bunch of establishment people.
[00:41:52.742 --> 00:41:54.243]  No, they've got a mix.
[00:41:54.363 --> 00:41:59.145]  And the good part is, Alex, that they're giving everybody a voice, and they've got a broad mix.
[00:41:59.265 --> 00:41:59.785]  It's real diverse.
[00:41:59.845 --> 00:42:04.327]  Now we should tell people that Sheriff Mack is involved in this.
[00:42:04.928 --> 00:42:05.848]  Is he still in the running?
[00:42:06.268 --> 00:42:06.488]  Yes.
[00:42:06.908 --> 00:42:08.429]  Yes, he is involved in this.
[00:42:08.789 --> 00:42:12.591]  He was at the news conference with us yesterday, and yes, he is in the running.
[00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:19.287]  And that's what is interesting is that we've got, surprisingly enough, nobody else knew any of the other candidates when they came in.
[00:42:19.307 --> 00:42:21.229]  I would say he's your only real competition.
[00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:23.210]  Yeah, and he was the only one that I knew.
[00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:31.036]  But the bottom line of it is, as we go from town to town, we get eliminated if we don't have the votes to stay in the running.
[00:42:31.056 --> 00:42:33.217]  How does the voting work?
[00:42:33.818 --> 00:42:38.681]  Okay, we each have a number, and that number changes every town we go to.
[00:42:39.222 --> 00:42:41.083]  And so we have to carry around these cards,
[00:42:41.454 --> 00:42:48.324]  Talk to people like right now, I'm at the Farmer's Market in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
[00:42:48.805 --> 00:42:52.590]  And I'm trying to talk to people here about what I believe and trying to get them to vote for me.
[00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:55.734]  Of course, they don't know what American candidate is.
[00:42:55.814 --> 00:42:57.337]  Are you allowed to use bullhorns?
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.781]  Yes, they can use bullhorns, yes.
[00:42:59.961 --> 00:43:02.323]  You've got to get a van, Joyce, and ride around with a bullhorn.
[00:43:02.343 --> 00:43:05.565]  I'll tell you, I would annihilate the competition.
[00:43:05.825 --> 00:43:06.285]  Oh, I know.
[00:43:06.345 --> 00:43:06.825]  You would.
[00:43:06.926 --> 00:43:07.346]  You would.
[00:43:08.006 --> 00:43:08.867]  You would have been great.
[00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:10.027]  That's fun.
[00:43:10.488 --> 00:43:12.009]  I think you need to do this the next time.
[00:43:12.689 --> 00:43:14.951]  When they do this again, I would love to see you do this.
[00:43:15.011 --> 00:43:15.711]  I don't know.
[00:43:15.751 --> 00:43:17.092]  How long are you going to be away from the show?
[00:43:17.992 --> 00:43:20.133]  Until I get eliminated, so we don't know.
[00:43:20.153 --> 00:43:25.494]  Let me give you a number that people need to call if they want to vote, if they believe in my issues and what I'm promoting.
[00:43:25.554 --> 00:43:27.935]  Oh, so you give them a number and then people call that number?
[00:43:28.315 --> 00:43:30.796]  That's correct, but they have to be in the state of Pennsylvania right now.
[00:43:30.876 --> 00:43:32.316]  See, we never know where we're going next.
[00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:34.437]  Okay, what's the phone number, Joyce?
[00:43:34.817 --> 00:43:35.457]  It's 877-RUN-9118, which is 877-786-9118.
[00:43:44.557 --> 00:43:44.877]  9-1-1-8.
[00:43:45.217 --> 00:43:50.819]  Now they can vote from pay phones, they can vote from their home phones, but they only get one vote per phone.
[00:43:51.659 --> 00:43:56.001]  So once that vote is in per phone, then they have to move on to the next phone or whatever.
[00:43:56.081 --> 00:44:02.203]  Okay, give that phone number out again.
[00:44:02.223 --> 00:44:02.843]  877-R-U-N-9-1-1-8.
[00:44:03.083 --> 00:44:11.666]  And it's really been an incredible time, Alex, because a lot of people don't know about how the President rules for executive orders.
[00:44:11.846 --> 00:44:12.926]  We talk about that here.
[00:44:13.362 --> 00:44:15.763]  We can talk about those kinds of things in front of the public.
[00:44:16.243 --> 00:44:23.726]  Yesterday, in the news conference that was in Allentown, I said, all nine candidates had a way to deal with no jobs.
[00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:28.488]  I was the only one that said, bring the jobs back from China.
[00:44:28.908 --> 00:44:30.128]  Bring them back from Malaysia.
[00:44:30.208 --> 00:44:30.748]  Bring them back.
[00:44:30.928 --> 00:44:32.069]  No outsourcing.
[00:44:32.449 --> 00:44:33.910]  I was the only one that said that.
[00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.410]  So, what we're doing is... Well, Joyce, that's exciting.
[00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:37.711]  Give folks that number one more time.
[00:44:37.731 --> 00:44:37.771]  877-786-8000.
[00:44:41.051 --> 00:44:41.311]  9-1-1-8.
[00:44:41.331 --> 00:44:47.015]  And if they know anybody in Pennsylvania, please have them call so we can get their vote.
[00:44:47.035 --> 00:44:47.435]  Okay.
[00:44:47.455 --> 00:44:48.376]  677-786-9118.
[00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:52.139]  Okay, Joyce, thank you, and I know you'll give us an update next week.
[00:44:52.539 --> 00:44:54.680]  And I understand you're going to be on the Power Hour next week, right?
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.941]  That's what I've been told, yes.
[00:44:55.981 --> 00:44:56.682]  Fantastic.
[00:44:56.742 --> 00:44:57.702]  Alright, thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:44:57.943 --> 00:44:58.523]  Thank you, Joyce.
[00:44:58.643 --> 00:44:59.023]  Appreciate it.
[00:44:59.123 --> 00:44:59.684]  Bye-bye.
[00:45:00.084 --> 00:45:06.729]  Yeah, I think Joyce, I mean, if it's really a fair situation, it's just between her and Richard Mack.
[00:45:09.617 --> 00:45:12.979]  Sounds like the rest of the competition sounds pretty lousy, folks.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:24.168]  Let me tell you, the establishment liberals cannot get a thimble's worth of people out to support them because their message just doesn't sell.
[00:45:25.909 --> 00:45:28.871]  That's why we get sold this fake conservatism of Lord Bush.
[00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:35.196]  I know we've got loaded phone lines, but here's this 60 Minutes piece from this weekend, just a part of it.
[00:45:35.922 --> 00:45:40.266]  And this is where they go through... I mean, they really whitewash this.
[00:45:40.326 --> 00:45:44.889]  So, I want to play it, and then I want to come back and comment on it and take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:51.515]  And of course, you can watch this video clip as well at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:52.796 --> 00:45:55.558]  But our multimedia website, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:55.979 --> 00:45:59.381]  But here is that clip from 60 Minutes.
[00:45:59.421 --> 00:46:00.082]  Listen carefully.
[00:46:01.218 --> 00:46:06.447]  What's important about the undergraduate years at Skull and Bones as opposed to fraternities
[00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:18.932]  Is that it imbues them with a kind of mission for moral leadership.
[00:46:19.032 --> 00:46:28.175]  And it's something that they may ignore for 30 years of their life, as George W. Bush seemed to successfully ignore it for quite a long time.
[00:46:28.576 --> 00:46:29.896]  But he came back to it.
[00:46:30.196 --> 00:46:32.397]  A born-again bonesman, you might say.
[00:46:33.077 --> 00:46:39.240]  Who, like his father and grandfather before him, has refused to talk openly about skull and bones.
[00:46:39.952 --> 00:46:46.609]  But as a bonesman, he was required to reveal his innermost secrets to his fellow bones initiates.
[00:46:47.566 --> 00:46:53.588]  They're supposed to recount their entire sexual histories in sort of a dim, dimly lit, cozy room.
[00:46:53.648 --> 00:47:00.370]  The other 14 members are sitting on plush couches and the lights are dimmed and there's a fire roaring.
[00:47:00.831 --> 00:47:05.152]  And this activity is supposed to last anywhere from between one to three hours.
[00:47:05.332 --> 00:47:09.954]  So George Bush, George W. Bush, recounted his sexual history?
[00:47:10.214 --> 00:47:11.794]  That would have been something they would have done, yes.
[00:47:12.434 --> 00:47:13.755]  What is the point of this?
[00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:28.606]  I believe the point of the Year in the Tomb is to forge such a strong bond between these 15 new members that after they graduate, for them to betray Skull and Bones would mean they'd have to betray their 14 closest friends.
[00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:33.531]  One can't help but make certain comparisons with the Mafia, for example.
[00:47:33.972 --> 00:47:34.953]  Secret Society.
[00:47:36.319 --> 00:47:36.879]  Bonding.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:44.783]  Stakes may be a little higher in one than the other, but everybody knows everything about everybody, which is a form of protection.
[00:47:45.003 --> 00:48:02.391]  I think Skull and Bones has had slightly more success than the Mafia, in the sense that, you know, the leaders of the five families are all doing a hundred years in jail, and the leaders of the Skull and Bone families are doing four and eight years in the White House.
[00:48:03.011 --> 00:48:05.372]  Bones is not restricted to Republicans.
[00:48:05.965 --> 00:48:09.167]  Yet another bonesman has his eye on the Oval Office.
[00:48:09.827 --> 00:48:12.009]  Senator John Kerry, Democrat.
[00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:13.410]  Skull and Bones, 1960.
[00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:29.999]  Yes, I mean, again, all the people say, oh, these societies don't matter, or the Eastern Establishment is in decline, and you could not find two more quintessential Eastern Establishment privileged guys.
[00:48:30.119 --> 00:48:37.482]  I remember when I was a nerdy scholarship student in the Reserve Book Room at the Yale Library,
[00:48:38.311 --> 00:48:43.615]  And John Kerry, who at that point styled himself John F. Kerry, would walk in.
[00:48:43.635 --> 00:48:45.056]  That was at JFK.
[00:48:45.176 --> 00:48:46.357]  At JFK, yes.
[00:48:46.417 --> 00:48:51.480]  There was always a little buzz because even then he was seen to be destined for higher things.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:58.725]  He was the head of the political union and a tap for skull and bones was seen as the natural sequel to that.
[00:48:59.245 --> 00:49:12.360]  David Brooks, a conservative commentator, who's published a book on the social dynamics of the outwardly mobile, says that while skull and bones may be elite and secret, it's anything but exciting.
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.504]  My view of secret societies is they're like the first class cabin in airplanes.
[00:49:16.684 --> 00:49:18.767]  They're really impressive until you get into them.
[00:49:19.307 --> 00:49:21.148]  And then once you're there, they're a little dull.
[00:49:21.648 --> 00:49:24.109]  So you hear all these conspiracy theories about Skull and Bones.
[00:49:24.149 --> 00:49:25.409]  Conspiracy to run the world.
[00:49:25.569 --> 00:49:26.069]  Exactly.
[00:49:26.149 --> 00:49:30.430]  And to me, to be in one of those organizations, you have to have an incredibly high tolerance for tedium.
[00:49:30.911 --> 00:49:33.131]  Because you're sitting around talking, talking, and talking.
[00:49:33.451 --> 00:49:34.972]  You're not running the world, you're just gassing.
[00:49:35.592 --> 00:49:45.535]  Gassing or not, Skull and Bones, the best connected white man's club in America, has moved, reluctantly, into the 21st century.
[00:49:45.835 --> 00:49:48.216]  Skull and Bones narrowly endorsed admitting women.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:50:00.352]  The day before these women were supposed to be initiated, a group of Bones men, including William F. Buckley, obtained a court order to block the initiation, claiming that letting women into the tomb would lead to date rape.
[00:50:00.952 --> 00:50:02.434]  Again, more legal wrangling.
[00:50:02.634 --> 00:50:06.478]  Finally, it came down to another vote, and women were admitted and initiated.
[00:50:06.998 --> 00:50:08.480]  So, Bones now has women?
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.461]  It has Jews, it has blacks, it has gays.
[00:50:12.182 --> 00:50:19.285]  It has the gays who got the SAT scores, it's got the gays who got the straight A's, it's got the blacks who are the president of the right associations.
[00:50:19.765 --> 00:50:25.028]  It's different criteria, more multicultural, but it's still an elite, selective institution.
[00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:33.812]  So a balance you find as bizarre as skull and bones seems to be from a certain perspective, it is something of value you would say?
[00:50:34.132 --> 00:50:37.454]  You take these young strivers, you put them in this weird castle,
[00:50:38.297 --> 00:50:43.682]  Uh, they share their, they spill their guts with each other, fine, but they learn something beyond themselves.
[00:50:43.722 --> 00:50:52.830]  They learn a commitment to each other, they learn a commitment to the community, and maybe they inherit some of those old ideals of public service that are missing in a lot of other parts of the country.
[00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:57.334]  Does that relationship... Okay, we gotta stop right there.
[00:50:57.354 --> 00:50:58.836]  We'll play the end of it when we get back.
[00:51:01.445 --> 00:51:05.771]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.971 --> 00:51:10.397]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.538 --> 00:51:14.923]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.964 --> 00:51:16.325]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.087 --> 00:51:22.312]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.372 --> 00:51:29.300]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.443]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.823 --> 00:51:42.185]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.425 --> 00:51:47.806]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:20.030]  Yes, we are!

[00:53:02.532 --> 00:53:02.852]  I think so.

[00:54:06.252 --> 00:54:14.054]  Alright, we're going to start the second hour here in just a few minutes, and I'll go to Paul and Michael and Andrea and Cliff and all the other great folks that have been patiently holding.
[00:54:15.314 --> 00:54:21.816]  We'll get into the discussion of an impeachment of Bush, this time in the Associated Press, and just so much other key news today.
[00:54:22.556 --> 00:54:26.977]  But back to the last minute or so of this skull and bones piece, and then I've got a comment on it from 60 Minutes.
[00:54:27.017 --> 00:54:27.317]  Go ahead.
[00:54:27.967 --> 00:54:41.030]  Does that relationship, forged with all this mumbo-jumbo and coffins and skulls and bones and all of that stuff, does that become, in some cases anyway, stronger than family, faith?
[00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:42.110]  Absolutely.
[00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:46.231]  You know, they say the motto at Yale is, for God, for country, and for Yale.
[00:54:46.511 --> 00:54:48.931]  At Bones, I would think it's for Bones.
[00:54:52.912 --> 00:54:56.773]  Okay, so, they get this little minion on there,
[00:54:58.061 --> 00:55:04.507]  They control the debate because Alexander Robinson, who we've interviewed, doesn't go, you know, 10% of the way towards the full truth, but it's bad enough.
[00:55:05.628 --> 00:55:08.290]  And the other guy on there, oh, you know, it's SAT scores.
[00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:08.830]  No, it's not.
[00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:14.035]  Bush had some of the lowest scores at the college, like a 73 or something, which is average for the four years.
[00:55:14.055 --> 00:55:16.137]  Actually, he was in college five years.
[00:55:16.157 --> 00:55:20.861]  I'm not saying that's bad, but the point is, is that it is bloodlines.
[00:55:21.741 --> 00:55:24.624]  And this is a complete
[00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:26.530]  And total fraud.
[00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:29.513]  And, you know, then to say, oh, secret societies don't have any power.
[00:55:29.553 --> 00:55:31.354]  Well, then why is the mafia secret?
[00:55:31.494 --> 00:55:33.456]  That is a good point that they make.
[00:55:33.476 --> 00:55:44.746]  And now we've got, you know, we've had three presidents, no, four presidents who were Skull & Bones members, most the CIA directors, a lot of your top corporate heads, and they make the core up of the Bohemian Grove.
[00:55:45.607 --> 00:55:48.710]  And, you know, there's other Skull & Bones chapters, by the way, around the planet.
[00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:49.210]  It's chapter 322.
[00:55:51.634 --> 00:55:53.657]  And, you know, the coffins and things.
[00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:54.599]  It's just mumbo-jumbo.
[00:55:54.659 --> 00:55:55.280]  It's just fun.
[00:55:55.981 --> 00:56:01.689]  It's a religion of war and death and being a parasite and feeding on the population.
[00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:06.376]  And then you notice that the presenter on 60 Minutes says, oh, a born-again bonesman.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.541]  Most people don't know what that means, folks.
[00:56:08.921 --> 00:56:11.363]  It's admitted that they channel Lucifer.
[00:56:11.723 --> 00:56:14.325]  Now, you may not believe in the devil, but the point is, they do.
[00:56:15.145 --> 00:56:16.186]  And this is an occult.
[00:56:16.566 --> 00:56:17.907]  This is as occult as it gets.
[00:56:17.967 --> 00:56:23.270]  I mean, on the show it shows the doorways and the skulls and this place built hundreds of years ago.
[00:56:24.011 --> 00:56:25.511]  This is chilling stuff.
[00:56:26.452 --> 00:56:30.855]  And John Quincy Adams had banned the group in the country, the Illuminati.
[00:56:30.875 --> 00:56:32.776]  I mean, our president wrote letters about it.
[00:56:33.136 --> 00:56:34.337]  Hunted these people down.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.981]  And they went back into Yale in 1832 and set it back up.
[00:56:38.001 --> 00:56:40.923]  I mean, this is very, very serious.
[00:56:42.724 --> 00:56:44.605]  And just watch the spin they put on this.
[00:56:44.685 --> 00:56:56.670]  Now we have both presidential candidates who are cousins on both sides of their family, double cousins, and they're members of Skull and Bones, and they're arrogant, predatory parasites.
[00:56:57.171 --> 00:56:58.031]  And I'm sick of them.
[00:56:59.031 --> 00:57:07.537]  But now, because it's so open, the media's gone from, it doesn't exist, you're a kook to talk about it, five, six years ago, to, yeah, Skull and Bones is real, but it's really no big deal.
[00:57:07.577 --> 00:57:16.262]  And three years ago, they released video of part of the ritual caught on tape, as they were worshipping Satan, doing mock sacrifices, a guy dressed up like the devil, saying, enter hell with me.
[00:57:16.282 --> 00:57:20.525]  And this is what goes on in the courtyard, behind the high walls.
[00:57:21.636 --> 00:57:31.500]  So, my friends, if you want to find out the truth about Skull and Bones, get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and we caught their Moloch worship on tape, the Canaanite human sacrifice god.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:33.401]  And oh, they're just having fun there, too!
[00:57:33.881 --> 00:57:36.682]  But then you look at what they do in the real world, it's evil, it's wickedness.
[00:57:36.962 --> 00:57:38.103]  No, they're not just having fun.
[00:57:38.123 --> 00:57:41.284]  These people are criminally insane on total power trips.
[00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:44.465]  They have a religion of hatred and not having a conscience.
[00:57:44.806 --> 00:57:45.606]  That's their religion.
[00:57:45.986 --> 00:57:46.906]  Do as thou wilt.
[00:57:48.007 --> 00:57:50.708]  The moniker, the icon of Satanism,
[00:57:51.781 --> 00:57:55.642]  Get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove when I infiltrated, coming up on July 15th.
[00:57:55.662 --> 00:57:56.622]  It'll be four years.
[00:57:57.062 --> 00:58:04.123]  Get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove by visiting InfoWars.com or PresentPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:04.143 --> 00:58:10.445]  Alright, we will start the second hour here momentarily and go to calls first for about 20-30 minutes.
[00:58:11.565 --> 00:58:13.085]  Then I'm going to get back into, well,
[00:58:18.624 --> 00:58:25.085]  And amongst those calls, I'll mix in the impeachment news and just a plethora of other key information.
[00:58:26.265 --> 00:58:36.327]  And of course, we do have a section on PrisonPlanet.tv, the Satanic Elite is what it's called, on Skull & Bones, on Bohemian Grove, and the Illuminati, where you can go check it out for yourself.
[00:58:36.347 --> 00:58:40.628]  This is public stuff, but the average person just isn't aware of it.
[00:58:41.068 --> 00:58:46.229]  So keep it locked in, stay with us, second hour, only 70 seconds away.
[00:58:46.369 --> 00:58:47.169]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.855 --> 00:58:55.138]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:59.381]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:58:59.621 --> 00:59:02.404]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:59:02.604 --> 00:59:05.006]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:59:05.186 --> 00:59:13.853]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:59:14.033 --> 00:59:15.394]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:59:15.575 --> 00:59:19.718]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:59:20.058 --> 00:59:20.579]  We're good to go!
[00:59:48.857 --> 00:59:50.198]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:50.238 --> 00:59:54.543]  Big Brother.
[00:59:54.623 --> 00:59:56.465]  Mainstream Media.
[01:00:00.911 --> 01:00:02.012]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.672 --> 01:00:03.493]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.253 --> 01:00:05.134]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.154 --> 01:00:09.757]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.997 --> 01:00:14.119]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.942 --> 01:00:18.962]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:21.364 --> 01:00:22.625]  We're now into hour two.
[01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:29.069]  The Associated Press is reporting that
[01:00:30.862 --> 01:00:42.092]  Many legal scholars and experts across the political spectrum have looked at the Bush Justice Department and Defense Department memos where they condone what they call abuse, that's double-speak for torture.
[01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:50.099]  And that the President is saying he's above the law, that that is an impeachable offense, we'll get into that article, just a ton of news.
[01:00:51.165 --> 01:00:57.028]  On the situation with Iraqis getting gas for five cents a gallon, but we don't, and much more.
[01:00:57.368 --> 01:00:59.989]  But right now, as promised, let's go ahead and get to your calls.
[01:01:00.749 --> 01:01:03.190]  Let's talk to Paul in Delaware.
[01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.210]  You're on the air, welcome.
[01:01:04.891 --> 01:01:05.391]  How you doing?
[01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:15.895]  Yeah, I just wanted to give a plug to your videos also, because they're easy for people to grasp, unlike a lot of bizarre videos I've come across in my eight years.
[01:01:15.955 --> 01:01:17.076]  I've seen about 700 of them, and
[01:01:18.263 --> 01:01:27.466]  I've seen everything from chupacabras to shapeshifters to UFOs, and I've yet to see any credible evidence, so thank you for not going off in that direction.
[01:01:28.527 --> 01:01:29.267]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:01:29.307 --> 01:01:36.409]  No, I mean, we're neurotic about documenting everything up one side and down the other, and the videos we cover are about the real world.
[01:01:36.849 --> 01:01:37.050]  Yeah.
[01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:40.471]  You were talking about skull and bones.
[01:01:41.311 --> 01:01:47.033]  One thing I'd like you to speak on is, I was reading Anthony Sutton's book, and they were talking about how they were
[01:01:48.194 --> 01:01:49.575]  Well, there is an elite obsession.
[01:02:03.401 --> 01:02:11.568]  I mean, it's really just one of the things the club's into, and the Diamonds and the rest of it, and the way the game is played.
[01:02:11.648 --> 01:02:15.491]  They supposedly were playing it back in the 1840s.
[01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:19.455]  They supposedly were part of developing and setting up the game.
[01:02:20.795 --> 01:02:25.917]  And so it's just kind of like one of the little side issues they're involved in in the game itself.
[01:02:25.937 --> 01:02:27.238]  This sounds nuts, but it's true.
[01:02:27.258 --> 01:02:32.899]  You know, the diamonds and the way it's played and the way it's done is kind of like a ritualistic thing.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:39.882]  It's very similar to the games they played that the Aztecs played at Chichen Itza in the ball playing court.
[01:02:40.662 --> 01:02:46.384]  And so a lot of these games, you know, go back to sports thousands of years ago were actually rituals.
[01:02:46.684 --> 01:02:48.725]  That sounds weird, but that's the facts.
[01:02:49.547 --> 01:02:53.150]  And there is an Illuminati connection to the Skull and Bones.
[01:02:53.550 --> 01:03:06.819]  I think if I recall... Even MSNBC admits that German money, or a German priest with British East Indian money, the Russell Trust, set it up with opium money, back when opium was legal, heroin, or what heroin comes from.
[01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:11.802]  And so, you know, the same folks that dealt the drugs then, the same families deal the drugs today.
[01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.065]  Who was it, the Roosevelt, I think it was?
[01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:20.202]  Roosevelt, the Bushes, others that go way back to that trade.
[01:03:20.983 --> 01:03:28.909]  And then one of the Russells, they were one of the founders of the Jehovah's Witnesses, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:03:28.929 --> 01:03:32.312]  A lot of bizarre connections, sir.
[01:03:32.532 --> 01:03:33.072]  Anything else?
[01:03:33.653 --> 01:03:40.778]  Yeah, I've been listening to you for a while about 9-11 and I haven't heard anything, I haven't ever heard you speak about the day of 9-11.
[01:03:42.344 --> 01:03:52.592]  I'm in Delaware, so I'm watching the Philadelphia News, and they found a locker full of SimTechs.
[01:03:53.012 --> 01:03:53.833]  I remember that!
[01:03:54.133 --> 01:03:56.455]  And then it just kind of blipped off the radar screen.
[01:03:56.555 --> 01:04:04.421]  Yeah, and of course, I did some follow-up, and they first tried to say that was a mistake, it never happened.
[01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:08.324]  I then asked the logical question, well, how'd you say that in the first place?
[01:04:08.384 --> 01:04:11.006]  And then they said that it came, it was some
[01:04:11.738 --> 01:04:18.964]  Some syntax from the Vietnam era, and that's all they would tell me, but still haven't heard any more about it.
[01:04:19.004 --> 01:04:21.206]  Sir, so many suspicious things happening.
[01:04:22.087 --> 01:04:22.487]  So many.
[01:04:22.507 --> 01:04:32.915]  You know, guys jumping up and down the roof, celebrating as the first plane hits, and then they follow them back to their office building and it's a known Mossad agent running it, and then they pull out and there's nothing but paper left on the floor.
[01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:35.398]  I'm not saying Israel did it, but they certainly had prior knowledge.
[01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:36.999]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:37.679]  Thanks for the call.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.702]  We'll come back, talk to Mike, Andrea, Cliff,
[01:04:41.562 --> 01:04:45.089]  And many others that are patiently holding and cover all that news that I was mentioning.
[01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:46.211]  Stay with us.
[01:04:46.271 --> 01:04:47.634]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:04:47.694 --> 01:04:50.079]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[01:04:53.334 --> 01:04:59.937]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:01.857]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:05:02.057 --> 01:05:04.258]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:05:04.418 --> 01:05:06.479]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:05:06.779 --> 01:05:11.721]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:16.083]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:05:16.343 --> 01:05:18.104]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:05:18.124 --> 01:05:28.829]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:05:28.989 --> 01:05:30.870]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:06:00.897 --> 01:06:05.120]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:12.386]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:12.787 --> 01:06:18.892]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:19.032 --> 01:06:20.233]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:20.573 --> 01:06:23.514]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:23.674 --> 01:06:25.695]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:33.238]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:06:33.538 --> 01:06:36.919]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:06:56.494 --> 01:07:05.325]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:07:05.646 --> 01:07:10.332]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:07:10.792 --> 01:07:17.500]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:07:17.901 --> 01:07:29.695]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:07:30.155 --> 01:07:34.617]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:08:02.772 --> 01:08:03.593]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.333 --> 01:08:05.234]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.254 --> 01:08:09.557]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.078 --> 01:08:14.201]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:20.146 --> 01:08:24.109]  Alright, there is a move in the Senate to impeach
[01:08:26.289 --> 01:08:26.969]  George Bush.
[01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:30.310]  But they'll save us with the other Skull and Bones member, of course.
[01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:34.131]  Let me cover this article, then we'll go straight to the loaded phone lines here.
[01:08:34.651 --> 01:08:38.432]  Legal scholars say condoning abuse could be impeachable offense.
[01:08:38.912 --> 01:08:40.573]  This out of the Associated Press.
[01:08:40.633 --> 01:08:53.776]  More than 400 legal scholars from across the country urged Congress Wednesday, that's yesterday, to consider impeaching President Bush and any high-level administration officials who approve the Iraq prisoner abuse.
[01:08:54.406 --> 01:09:11.426]  Well, if we're going to try to impeach Bill Clinton over lying about sex, which I think is a fine thing to do, I mean, the reason they couldn't go after Bill Clinton on all the other issues of drug dealing and murders and Chinese sellouts is because the Republicans were all involved too, so they picked a little side issue.
[01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:14.490]  In a letter released by two Harvard Law professors,
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:24.946]  Scholars ask Congress to identify everyone who should be held accountable for the torture at Abu Ghraib Prison and determine what sanctions are appropriate.
[01:09:24.966 --> 01:09:31.550]  The sanctions, they said, could include impeachment and removal from office of any civil officer of the United States responsible.
[01:09:33.392 --> 01:09:44.639]  And it says the Democratic Senators are trying to round up enough support for the vote today to subpoena the Justice Department for memos that could have laid the legal groundwork for justifying the prisoner abuse.
[01:09:44.719 --> 01:09:45.500]  Again, it's torture.
[01:09:46.118 --> 01:09:52.281]  Attorney General John Ashcroft has declined to make public the Justice Department memos written in 2002.
[01:09:52.741 --> 01:09:57.864]  And there's other Defense Department memos from 2003, saying Bush is above federal law.
[01:09:58.364 --> 01:10:03.046]  In the letter, scholars said the prosecution of low-level military personnel, though the abuse is not enough.
[01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:13.851]  Harvard Law professor Christine Deason said Congress would have to determine if the abuse rose to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, which would be punishable by impeachment.
[01:10:16.155 --> 01:10:19.136]  So it's pretty serious that move is taking place.
[01:10:19.496 --> 01:10:29.117]  The prisoner abuse, again, the prisoner torture, made public in photos and video, is being investigated, that is whitewashed, by military and Justice Department officials.
[01:10:29.217 --> 01:10:30.598]  Rumsfeld is investigating himself.
[01:10:30.958 --> 01:10:32.178]  Ashcroft is investigating himself.
[01:10:32.578 --> 01:10:38.119]  And Congress is looking into administration memos that could have laid the legal groundwork for justifying the abuse.
[01:10:38.779 --> 01:10:40.199]  Bush has said he directed U.S.
[01:10:40.239 --> 01:10:44.360]  officials to confirm to the law and international treaties.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:44.900]  Sure.
[01:10:47.296 --> 01:10:48.097]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:10:48.657 --> 01:10:53.081]  The letter was signed by the host of legal notables, including former O.J.
[01:10:53.121 --> 01:11:01.628]  Simpson defender, Alan Dershowitz, and Reverend Robert F. Dryden, a former Massachusetts Congress member, who teaches at Georgetown University Law School.
[01:11:01.909 --> 01:11:02.809]  Talk about a shill!
[01:11:02.829 --> 01:11:04.311]  They're not going to do anything, folks!
[01:11:04.871 --> 01:11:12.037]  Alan Dershowitz has been in at least 50 news articles and on TV that I've seen calling for brutal torture!
[01:11:12.718 --> 01:11:12.838]  Ha!
[01:11:13.018 --> 01:11:14.960]  He's been here at UT calling for it!
[01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:16.547]  They're giving speeches.
[01:11:16.627 --> 01:11:20.750]  I mean, this is... Again, it's the pot calling the kettle black.
[01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:22.371]  I mean, it's a staged event.
[01:11:24.653 --> 01:11:27.996]  Of course, there's no honor among these people, so they're probably just threatening each other with it.
[01:11:28.536 --> 01:11:30.658]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls, and I mean quickly.
[01:11:30.738 --> 01:11:31.899]  Mike in Florida, go ahead.
[01:11:32.139 --> 01:11:32.900]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:33.140]  Good.
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.502]  Yeah, I just wanted to talk about a few things real quick.
[01:11:36.763 --> 01:11:38.884]  One was the Skull and Bones ritual.
[01:11:38.924 --> 01:11:39.945]  It seemed that they left out
[01:11:41.826 --> 01:11:59.691]  Kind of like an important weird part about the entire, they might not do it anymore, but the entire like sexual touching thing, like as they recount their experiences to their... Well let's, we have a lot of children listening and it's admitted what they do, they have, they do things with skulls, they do things together, it's just, it's Christian and conservative.
[01:11:59.951 --> 01:12:03.011]  Exactly, that's why I didn't want to go into any detail because there are children listening.
[01:12:03.071 --> 01:12:04.372]  And by the way, that's all admitted.
[01:12:04.572 --> 01:12:08.753]  Yeah, and then the next thing I wanted to talk about, yesterday a friend of mine, he's kind of
[01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:11.373]  Uh, a neocon getting, kind of waking up.
[01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:12.574]  He's on the verge of waking up.
[01:12:12.614 --> 01:12:14.495]  He's putting, you know, the dots together, fortunately.
[01:12:14.515 --> 01:12:19.678]  He's very Christian, so he's concerned about this entire move towards microchips and all this kind of stuff, and he was...
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:22.142]  Listening to a Sean Hannity show yesterday.
[01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:24.224]  Who says that every child needs a chip?
[01:12:24.284 --> 01:12:25.005]  I have him on video.
[01:12:25.185 --> 01:12:25.525]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:25.545 --> 01:12:31.130]  Well, not only that, but a caller called up, you know, there's this new kidnapping in Saudi Arabia of this prisoner.
[01:12:31.631 --> 01:12:34.693]  Yes, and let me guess, if he had a chip, he'd be safe.
[01:12:35.034 --> 01:12:35.394]  Exactly.
[01:12:35.414 --> 01:12:40.799]  And a caller called in and suggested this, and you know, I was telling my friend, I'm like, let me guess, Sean Hannity thought it was the best thing in the world.
[01:12:40.819 --> 01:12:44.162]  By the way, it's always, I've heard it like three times, it's the same voice, the same guy.
[01:12:44.382 --> 01:12:45.804]  Ooh, let's go to a call now.
[01:12:46.284 --> 01:12:46.885]  Hi!
[01:12:46.905 --> 01:12:49.707]  You know, it's obviously an exec at Applied Digital.
[01:12:49.727 --> 01:12:53.449]  They've been caught with their... the family's out getting the chips, it turns out, worked for the company.
[01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:55.371]  I mean, they're masters of staging things.
[01:12:55.391 --> 01:12:58.753]  They're the first hospitals to take the injectors and the wands that read them.
[01:12:58.973 --> 01:13:03.816]  You know, or have presidents that are on the board of Applied Digital, but... Hi, Sean!
[01:13:04.017 --> 01:13:05.398]  I think you should have a chip!
[01:13:05.718 --> 01:13:06.698]  Oh, that's a great idea!
[01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:07.939]  Oh, how spontaneous!
[01:13:07.959 --> 01:13:08.840]  That's a good idea!
[01:13:09.881 --> 01:13:10.241]  Go ahead.
[01:13:10.681 --> 01:13:12.062]  Yeah, and that was pretty much it.
[01:13:12.082 --> 01:13:13.003]  And also, I was just, um...
[01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:22.305]  Wondering if you could give any advice to maybe crack through this, you know, cult of Bush, cult of Kerry, that, you know, people are just so kind of blinded by their ideological affiliations.
[01:13:22.325 --> 01:13:33.773]  Well, Kerry says he's for the war, he says he's for staying, Kerry's for open borders, Kerry's for gun control, Kerry's for signing on to UNESCO, Kerry's for increasing the funding of the IMF and World Bank, and Bush is for every one of those.
[01:13:34.314 --> 01:13:36.335]  The rhetoric is different, the actions are the same.
[01:13:36.656 --> 01:13:39.678]  So it's just a matter of pointing out the same actions.
[01:13:40.362 --> 01:13:41.022]  Yeah, just look.
[01:13:41.242 --> 01:13:44.804]  They'll have somebody who we know is bad, like Hillary Clinton, come out and attack Bush.
[01:13:44.844 --> 01:13:50.406]  And then, oh, if Hillary attacked Bush on the plea to uranium, the plea to uranium must be good because we know Hillary's bad.
[01:13:50.986 --> 01:13:53.827]  Again, they know that we're going to cheer for one of the pro wrestlers.
[01:13:55.114 --> 01:13:58.496]  You've got to explain that it's pro-wrestling and pro-wrestling isn't real.
[01:13:59.357 --> 01:14:10.142]  We have to have that child-like argument with these child-like minds and go, no, you can't hit somebody over the head with a metal chair 55 times and they not be in a coma.
[01:14:10.483 --> 01:14:11.843]  No, wrestling's real.
[01:14:12.083 --> 01:14:13.644]  Full-grown adults call in and argue.
[01:14:13.884 --> 01:14:14.625]  No, no, it's real.
[01:14:14.685 --> 01:14:15.005]  It's real.
[01:14:15.928 --> 01:14:17.629]  You know, and the wrestlers are out saying it's fake.
[01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.570]  So, it's the same thing.
[01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:22.092]  I mean, you've got millions of people who think wrestling's real.
[01:14:22.112 --> 01:14:24.873]  You've got hundreds of millions of people who think politics is real.
[01:14:25.193 --> 01:14:25.414]  Yeah.
[01:14:26.014 --> 01:14:28.756]  I mean, what, 70% of the public doesn't vote on average?
[01:14:28.776 --> 01:14:31.777]  I mean, half do in the presidential elections, but it's much lower in other elections.
[01:14:31.977 --> 01:14:33.818]  Because people instinctively know it isn't real.
[01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:34.899]  Yeah.
[01:14:34.919 --> 01:14:36.060]  Exactly.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.881]  Okay, well that's pretty much it.
[01:14:38.201 --> 01:14:39.122]  Alright, good to hear from you.
[01:14:39.182 --> 01:14:40.102]  Really good questions, Mike.
[01:14:40.502 --> 01:14:41.383]  Andrea in Ohio.
[01:14:41.423 --> 01:14:42.223]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:14:43.784 --> 01:14:44.385]  Hello, Alex.
[01:14:44.585 --> 01:14:44.905]  Hello!
[01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:47.210]  Um, good talking to you again.
[01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:56.876]  Um, kind of a comment to piggyback on to yesterday and your comments earlier today about the implants, the brain implants.
[01:14:57.456 --> 01:14:58.817]  Yeah, it's going to help the children.
[01:14:58.897 --> 01:15:00.177]  It's going to help them not be depressed.
[01:15:00.197 --> 01:15:00.838]  Aren't you for it?
[01:15:01.398 --> 01:15:02.319]  No, I'm not.
[01:15:02.559 --> 01:15:04.020]  And I'll tell you why.
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:14.886]  Because, um, what they do is, is they, uh, in these, these countries like Russia and, uh,
[01:15:15.896 --> 01:15:25.486]  In Northern Ireland, just with the drugs now, with the psychotropic drugs like prolixin, the Northern Ireland
[01:15:25.936 --> 01:15:28.858]  They use that a lot on political prisoners.
[01:15:29.218 --> 01:15:39.744]  Well, the Supreme Court ruled they can grab you and put you in solitary confinement for seven years and drug you with anti-psychotics even worse than the Prozac type uptake inhibitors.
[01:15:41.545 --> 01:15:43.146]  The Soviets did it.
[01:15:43.186 --> 01:15:44.127]  The Soviets tortured.
[01:15:44.147 --> 01:15:45.267]  The Soviets forced drugs.
[01:15:45.528 --> 01:15:46.268]  Isn't this freedom?
[01:15:47.068 --> 01:15:47.269]  No.
[01:15:47.469 --> 01:15:52.932]  And the thing of it is, the Soviets, what they would do is they would put somebody on these drugs.
[01:15:53.797 --> 01:15:57.501]  And they would say, well, you know, these weird diagnoses.
[01:15:57.581 --> 01:16:01.364]  If you've ever read Vladimir Bukovsky's book, To Build a Castle.
[01:16:01.604 --> 01:16:02.125]  Yeah, I have.
[01:16:02.265 --> 01:16:03.486]  Everybody's mentally ill.
[01:16:03.606 --> 01:16:04.007]  Yeah!
[01:16:04.027 --> 01:16:06.989]  The state doesn't violate your rights.
[01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:08.431]  You get a tribunal, but see the...
[01:16:10.372 --> 01:16:24.740]  The men in black masks grab you, put you in the van, you're never seen again, and ten years later you're released a vegetable and, you know, get a job for the Supreme Soviets, you know, picking up trash on the street, and you sit there drooling, but that's freedom!
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:39.428]  Well, the thing of it is, and this is the truly sobering thing, Kate Millett, I'm a reader, and like you, I like to read crime books as well, but in Kate Millett's book, The Politics of Cruelty,
[01:16:40.222 --> 01:16:53.794]  She makes a rather telling comment that if you are a political dissident, you at least have the fellowship and the feeling of camaraderie of other political dissidents.
[01:16:54.455 --> 01:17:05.625]  But these totalitarian regimes have learned, see, that if they can label an individual as mad, then that person is isolated.
[01:17:06.024 --> 01:17:22.951]  Well, that's what happened in 1984, which, again, Eric Blair, George Orwell is his pen name, had worked for the Soviets, had worked for the Empire, had worked for the BBC, had worked for all sides, found out it was all the same, and they drug Winston, they torture Winston.
[01:17:23.051 --> 01:17:29.614]  I mean, this is what they do, but it's loving, because Winston was undermining the state and aiding Al-Qaeda, I mean, Goldstein.
[01:17:29.674 --> 01:17:31.655]  Hey, thanks for the call, great points.
[01:17:32.235 --> 01:17:33.156]  Cliff in Virginia.
[01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:33.856]  Cliff, go ahead.
[01:17:36.161 --> 01:17:37.121]  Hello, Cliff.
[01:17:37.321 --> 01:17:37.682]  Hello.
[01:17:37.962 --> 01:17:38.302]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:38.622 --> 01:17:39.442]  So, how you doing, Alex?
[01:17:39.522 --> 01:17:39.762]  Good.
[01:17:39.943 --> 01:17:41.303]  Thank you for taking my call today.
[01:17:41.543 --> 01:17:41.943]  You bet.
[01:17:42.003 --> 01:17:43.744]  Maybe we should arrest you and put you in a prison.
[01:17:44.084 --> 01:17:45.965]  Hey, as long as you don't put no chip in me.
[01:17:47.265 --> 01:17:51.047]  But, uh, I just have... The brain chip's gonna make you feel better and be one of us, okay?
[01:17:51.387 --> 01:17:52.288]  Uh, not me, buddy.
[01:17:52.988 --> 01:17:54.388]  I've got a bigger plan for me.
[01:17:54.869 --> 01:17:56.529]  Well, that's al-Qaeda-ish, but go ahead.
[01:17:56.729 --> 01:18:00.351]  Yeah, but I got three quick points I'd like to get your comments on, if I could.
[01:18:00.791 --> 01:18:01.051]  Sure.
[01:18:01.331 --> 01:18:05.653]  And the first one was, I was watching MSNBC earlier here today, well, about 20 minutes ago,
[01:18:06.603 --> 01:18:10.469]  Uh, they were talking about the 9-1-1 Commission wrapping things up and how that, uh...
[01:18:11.129 --> 01:18:14.892]  Had those fighter jets intercepted those planes, they could have prevented 9-1-1.
[01:18:15.272 --> 01:18:20.836]  But nobody could get a hold of Cheney, who was in the bunker, running and all.
[01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:21.356]  That's admitted.
[01:18:21.376 --> 01:18:22.397]  They won't release the details.
[01:18:22.457 --> 01:18:29.842]  Or Bush, who was told in the limousine, in the green room, before he read the little story to the schoolchildren.
[01:18:30.262 --> 01:18:31.723]  And they said there were a few accidents.
[01:18:31.783 --> 01:18:32.404]  That's right.
[01:18:32.444 --> 01:18:33.624]  The plane's messed up.
[01:18:33.704 --> 01:18:35.646]  And it's the military's fault.
[01:18:35.866 --> 01:18:38.808]  Yeah, they said that's why they kept him ground, because they couldn't get him up in time.
[01:18:39.068 --> 01:18:39.548]  That's right.
[01:18:39.568 --> 01:18:43.611]  It was, you know, if your assistant goes off course for five minutes, they'll launch F-16s in every case.
[01:18:43.631 --> 01:18:51.717]  But for the first time ever with four separate planes, it just magically stood down because the CIA was running a drill of flying hijacked jets in the buildings and they thought it was just a drill.
[01:18:52.117 --> 01:18:52.357]  Yeah.
[01:18:53.118 --> 01:18:54.859]  This isn't all an accident, sir.
[01:18:55.199 --> 01:18:59.202]  They just so happened to be running a drill that morning of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center Pentagon.
[01:18:59.422 --> 01:19:00.783]  It was all a complete coincidence.
[01:19:00.883 --> 01:19:01.524]  I mean, come on.
[01:19:02.464 --> 01:19:06.307]  If you don't think it was a coincidence, you're mentally ill and need to be arrested.
[01:19:07.368 --> 01:19:08.628]  Yeah, I know what you mean there.
[01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:13.509]  No, my friend of ten years told me this again in the hallway Tuesday night at this TV station.
[01:19:13.569 --> 01:19:14.570]  I should be put in prison.
[01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:17.290]  Oh, I get that all the time from people I've tried to tell.
[01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:19.651]  Oh, it's because all the neocons say it.
[01:19:19.691 --> 01:19:21.871]  This is the time to arrest people for what they say.
[01:19:21.911 --> 01:19:22.711]  It's part of the freedom.
[01:19:23.131 --> 01:19:25.692]  Yeah, I'm a fruit loop and a fruitcake and a menace.
[01:19:26.492 --> 01:19:27.272]  It's just pathetic.
[01:19:27.792 --> 01:19:28.973]  Anything else on your mind?
[01:19:29.253 --> 01:19:36.014]  Uh, yeah, the second one I'd like to get your comment on here is about this group we have in Iraq who's being charged with murder.
[01:19:37.367 --> 01:19:46.396]  I'd like to know where and when somebody's going to charge Dubby and Chaney and Powell and Rumsfeld and all of them for sending our troops over there after it's become planned.
[01:19:46.416 --> 01:19:48.478]  Well, I'll tell you what, stay there and we'll talk about it.
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:50.921]  Very Al Qaeda-ish.
[01:19:53.559 --> 01:19:57.181]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.

[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:54.224]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:22:54.304 --> 01:22:56.806]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:22:56.986 --> 01:22:57.686]  It feels great.
[01:22:57.867 --> 01:22:58.927]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:22:58.988 --> 01:23:04.532]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:23:04.832 --> 01:23:06.353]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[01:23:06.634 --> 01:23:08.995]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:23:09.136 --> 01:23:12.258]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:23:12.418 --> 01:23:14.521]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:23:14.541 --> 01:23:18.245]  I have a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:23:18.345 --> 01:23:19.146]  Well, that's for sure.
[01:23:19.306 --> 01:23:19.887]  Was it easy?
[01:23:20.107 --> 01:23:20.728]  Very easy.
[01:23:20.768 --> 01:23:21.649]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:26.834]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[01:23:27.415 --> 01:23:33.340]  You can lose fat the safe and healthy way just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:34.761]  Call right now 1-800-622-THIN.

[01:23:42.188 --> 01:23:42.808]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:59.332]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:03.533 --> 01:24:05.874]  Alright, my friends, let's go straight back to the calls.
[01:24:05.934 --> 01:24:08.655]  Finish up what you were saying, Cliff, in Virginia.
[01:24:09.255 --> 01:24:13.416]  Uh, yeah, I was talking about the troop in Iraq who was being charged with murder.
[01:24:13.436 --> 01:24:14.836]  Yes.
[01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:23.299]  I can't understand why, after there was no evidence of WMDs and no ties with Saddam to 9-1-1, Osama, or Al-Qaeda,
[01:24:23.891 --> 01:24:26.893]  Why Bush and others aren't being brought up any type of murder charges?
[01:24:26.913 --> 01:24:31.036]  Because how many people have they killed by putting troops in Iraq and Afghanistan?
[01:24:31.276 --> 01:24:35.959]  It's conservatively 50,000 civilians, innocents killed in Iraq.
[01:24:35.979 --> 01:24:36.840]  That's the admitted numbers.
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:41.123]  And I think it was like 12,000 a few months ago in Afghanistan.
[01:24:41.603 --> 01:24:41.703]  Yeah.
[01:24:41.723 --> 01:24:44.485]  And that's not counting military they've killed.
[01:24:44.745 --> 01:24:45.746]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:24:45.786 --> 01:24:50.289]  But yet nothing, you know, it's like W and M are walking on water, you know, while our troops are paying the price.
[01:24:50.686 --> 01:24:52.127]  With their own lives on the line.
[01:24:52.267 --> 01:24:54.329]  And breathing depleted uranium, thanks for the call.
[01:24:54.810 --> 01:24:56.811]  No, I hear you Cliff, it's incredible.
[01:24:57.212 --> 01:24:58.373]  Walt in Michigan.
[01:24:58.413 --> 01:24:59.133]  Walt, go ahead.
[01:24:59.153 --> 01:25:05.339]  Hey Alex, I tried to get a hold of Fritz Springmeier's wife to see how she was doing.
[01:25:05.779 --> 01:25:08.661]  Yeah, I mean to get Fritz Springmeier's wife on the show.
[01:25:09.042 --> 01:25:16.328]  Well, I called her number, her number at home, and her number's been disconnected and no longer in service.
[01:25:18.801 --> 01:25:19.201]  I don't know.
[01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:31.395]  It's like when one of our other people moved and everybody was calling and going, where are they at, where are they at, and then they just moved.
[01:25:32.833 --> 01:25:33.873]  That was Galen Ross.
[01:25:34.013 --> 01:25:34.994]  I don't want to start rumors.
[01:25:35.014 --> 01:25:37.335]  Let me just try to make a phone call and check that out, okay?
[01:25:37.595 --> 01:25:38.335]  One other question.
[01:25:39.135 --> 01:25:41.056]  Well, that really wasn't a question that you just had.
[01:25:41.076 --> 01:25:42.616]  I mean, because I don't know the answer, but go ahead.
[01:25:42.936 --> 01:25:43.817]  I have another question.
[01:25:44.717 --> 01:25:48.778]  What's the name of the detention facility or prison that Fritz Springmeier's at?
[01:25:49.059 --> 01:25:50.979]  I've got the address, but not the name of the place.
[01:25:50.999 --> 01:25:52.200]  I don't have that in front of me.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:52.960]  I'm sorry.
[01:25:53.442 --> 01:25:56.705]  Anybody in your office have it that they could give it to me out there?
[01:25:57.085 --> 01:26:05.252]  Well, one of his books was published by a lady named Sandra, who actually works for Tex Mars, so you might contact that office and talk to her, sir.
[01:26:05.792 --> 01:26:07.573]  Tex Mars, do you have his current phone number?
[01:26:07.834 --> 01:26:09.835]  You know, see, I just, we don't screen calls.
[01:26:09.855 --> 01:26:10.756]  We just take calls.
[01:26:10.896 --> 01:26:16.541]  I didn't know when I came in today that somebody would ask me for a Texas number or for Springmeyer's.
[01:26:16.801 --> 01:26:17.181]  No, I don't.
[01:26:17.221 --> 01:26:17.742]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:17.782 --> 01:26:18.442]  I appreciate it, Walt.
[01:26:19.223 --> 01:26:20.083]  Anna in Texas.
[01:26:20.203 --> 01:26:21.004]  Anna, you're on the air.
[01:26:21.044 --> 01:26:21.444]  Go ahead.
[01:26:22.403 --> 01:26:22.683]  Yes.
[01:26:23.003 --> 01:26:27.826]  I know that you hate to be praised, but you've got to give me one minute on that, or one second on that.
[01:26:28.427 --> 01:26:40.514]  From the time that no one would listen to my harassment that the Social Security was trying to get money out of me, no one, years and years and years ago, would listen to me but you.
[01:26:40.534 --> 01:26:44.437]  And I want to thank you for what you've done and your perseverance.
[01:26:44.497 --> 01:26:45.758]  Now let me get to my little thing.
[01:26:46.398 --> 01:26:49.220]  If Terry gets elected,
[01:26:50.134 --> 01:26:52.655]  They can impeach Bush and then Kerry will pardon him anyway.
[01:26:53.956 --> 01:26:56.257]  It's a county catch-22, isn't it?
[01:26:56.277 --> 01:27:01.359]  Well that's right, because a Skull and Bones member has got to come out for another Skull and Bones member.
[01:27:01.399 --> 01:27:02.480]  That's part of the ritual.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.181]  Yeah, they'll just pardon him anyway.
[01:27:04.201 --> 01:27:05.321]  It just costs a lot of money.
[01:27:05.341 --> 01:27:06.702]  A lot of lawyers get a lot of money.
[01:27:07.763 --> 01:27:13.585]  I want to tell you how much I appreciate also the attention you've given to Ritalin or else.
[01:27:14.566 --> 01:27:18.328]  And that's happening in my own family and my daughter homeschools.
[01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:21.210]  I just flew back from D.C.
[01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:22.631]  and boy, my arms are tied.
[01:27:22.671 --> 01:27:23.131]  No, I'm sorry.
[01:27:23.691 --> 01:27:36.195]  But I saw so many children on sugar screaming and rolling in the aisles that I absolutely could not believe the control that's happened.
[01:27:36.335 --> 01:27:41.136]  And they put the Coke machines in the public schools and the children get all hyped up on it.
[01:27:41.276 --> 01:27:43.217]  Oh, we've got to put you on a deadly amphetamine.
[01:27:43.237 --> 01:27:44.157]  Thanks for the call, Ann.
[01:27:44.837 --> 01:27:45.878]  Bill in Idaho.
[01:27:45.938 --> 01:27:46.698]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:27:46.718 --> 01:27:47.218]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:27:48.058 --> 01:27:51.139]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to give you a point of information.
[01:27:51.159 --> 01:27:58.522]  Occasionally watch Charlie Rose on PBS, who loves to have the insiders on.
[01:27:58.602 --> 01:28:00.462]  Oh yeah, it's a big insider program.
[01:28:00.682 --> 01:28:06.164]  Oh, he loves to have those guests on and they can come on and do their spin and tell their funny little jokes and everything.
[01:28:06.804 --> 01:28:13.987]  On June 9th, show June 9th, which was last Wednesday's show, he had William Buckley on.
[01:28:14.027 --> 01:28:16.308]  The very beginning of the show,
[01:28:18.664 --> 01:28:35.134]  He made a reference to, they were of course reminiscing about Reagan, and made a reference to how he was referring to himself, Buckley and Reagan were at the Bohemian Grove, and told a little anecdote about George Bush arriving.
[01:28:35.154 --> 01:28:43.199]  You know, and they go on to proceed to talk about things, but there's never any references to what is the Bohemian Grove?
[01:28:43.655 --> 01:28:47.679]  I'm sure most of Charlie Rose's listeners haven't even heard of the name of the player.
[01:28:47.699 --> 01:28:49.620]  So, who was on Charlie Rose when this happened?
[01:28:50.241 --> 01:28:51.141]  William F. Buckley.
[01:28:52.042 --> 01:28:52.983]  You know, Firing Line.
[01:28:53.483 --> 01:28:55.105]  Oh, I know who he is.
[01:28:55.325 --> 01:28:56.466]  Neo-Con Chieftain.
[01:28:56.986 --> 01:28:58.568]  Yeah.
[01:28:58.768 --> 01:29:01.711]  He's a Bonzer as well.
[01:29:02.291 --> 01:29:04.113]  I just thought it was pretty interesting.
[01:29:04.253 --> 01:29:05.634]  What was the date on that broadcast?
[01:29:06.293 --> 01:29:08.635]  June 9th, which was last Wednesday's show.
[01:29:08.695 --> 01:29:11.677]  Man, if that re-airs, folks, tape it and send me a copy.
[01:29:11.838 --> 01:29:16.601]  I wish to God I had... So he had a little joke about Bohemian Grove.
[01:29:17.522 --> 01:29:31.032]  A little joke about... Reagan was in... I believe it went something along the lines where he was making references to Reagan was, you know, at the end of his term and probably at the beginnings of his Alzheimer's.
[01:29:32.819 --> 01:29:39.883]  He's standing with Buckley and walks up George Bush and he doesn't recognize George Bush and they have a little laugh about it.
[01:29:40.063 --> 01:29:40.983]  Oh, that's real funny.
[01:29:41.183 --> 01:29:41.924]  I'll be right back.
[01:29:43.825 --> 01:29:44.725]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.225 --> 01:29:46.826]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.767 --> 01:29:50.428]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.533 --> 01:29:57.254]  The grass is always greener with a wheatgrass kit from wheatgrasskits.com.

[01:30:16.278 --> 01:30:16.518]  I think so.
[01:30:33.445 --> 01:30:36.867]  Research is showing that antioxidants are instrumental in preventing cancer.

[01:30:53.399 --> 01:30:55.360]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:31:06.167]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Murky PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Murky Light's Black Murky Purification Elements.
[01:31:06.527 --> 01:31:11.070]  The Murky's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Murky Purification Element.
[01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:22.478]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:31:23.058 --> 01:31:29.903]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:31:30.303 --> 01:31:32.425]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:31:32.925 --> 01:31:37.889]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:44.960]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:48.766]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:31:49.006 --> 01:31:49.827]  That's toll free.
[01:31:49.848 --> 01:31:49.888]  888-803-4438.
[01:31:54.025 --> 01:31:56.306]  My family's breathing easier, and now you can too!
[01:31:56.486 --> 01:31:59.827]  Hey folks, Michael Trudell here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[01:31:59.948 --> 01:32:02.148]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[01:32:02.329 --> 01:32:08.291]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[01:32:08.491 --> 01:32:11.072]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[01:32:11.332 --> 01:32:11.993]  Nothing escapes!
[01:32:12.113 --> 01:32:16.334]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[01:32:16.514 --> 01:32:20.136]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[01:32:20.256 --> 01:32:22.477]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone.
[01:32:22.737 --> 01:32:23.057]  Smoke?
[01:32:23.277 --> 01:32:25.159]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[01:32:25.319 --> 01:32:28.401]  Our Biozone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[01:32:28.601 --> 01:32:32.724]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your Biozone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[01:32:32.884 --> 01:32:35.526]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.
[01:32:35.706 --> 01:32:38.488]  Call toll-free, 888-88-MY-AIR today.
[01:32:38.588 --> 01:32:40.929]  That's 1-888-88-MY-AIR.

[01:32:44.071 --> 01:32:45.732]  That's purifymyair.com.

[01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:52.297]  Get your Biozone Air Purifier today, and you'll be breathing easier, too.
[01:33:22.012 --> 01:33:26.735]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're back live and we're going to go back to your calls.
[01:33:26.875 --> 01:33:36.621]  Gabe and Mary and Kelly and many others that are patiently holding and I've got a bunch of other key news items that I'm going to get to as well concerning torture, the economy.
[01:33:37.202 --> 01:33:41.364]  In Iraq, they get their gas for five cents a gallon.
[01:33:41.805 --> 01:33:43.726]  We'll explain why that's the case.
[01:33:44.526 --> 01:33:48.609]  But for a few minutes here I want to spend some time with Jim Shepard.
[01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:49.990]  I haven't had him on in a few weeks.
[01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:52.570]  It's always good to talk to Jim.
[01:33:53.011 --> 01:33:55.913]  Jim's the owner of New Millennium Concepts, our biggest sponsor.
[01:33:56.634 --> 01:34:01.799]  Made in America, high quality, Berkey light systems.
[01:34:01.999 --> 01:34:04.061]  They also have the British Birkfeld, if you want that.
[01:34:04.982 --> 01:34:09.566]  And just an amazing price, made in America, employing Americans.
[01:34:09.686 --> 01:34:10.947]  I know it's Al-Qaeda-ish, but
[01:34:12.057 --> 01:34:16.058]  It's still supporting America, which I know is bad, according to the neocons.
[01:34:16.138 --> 01:34:21.359]  But Bush says exporting more jobs is good, and hamburger jobs are industrial.
[01:34:22.379 --> 01:34:24.340]  But we believe that's a bad thing.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.080]  Jim, good to have you on with us, my friend.
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.040]  Always a pleasure to be with you, Alex.
[01:34:29.481 --> 01:34:29.821]  You bet.
[01:34:30.061 --> 01:34:34.802]  Tell folks about the murky water filters, and then why they should get them.
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:45.767]  You know, we focus a lot on the power of the unit, and it simply is the most powerful water filtration device, personal device you can have, bar none.
[01:34:46.587 --> 01:34:50.410]  We've been told by the laboratories that we've set a whole new standard in water purification.
[01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:56.534]  But one thing that we rarely mention, Alex, is the simplicity of it.
[01:34:56.935 --> 01:35:02.379]  And I know that sounds kind of crazy, but when we first introduced these into the United States back in the 90s,
[01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:10.621]  We would get people calling us and telling us how much they love this system, just because it's comprehensible.
[01:35:10.701 --> 01:35:12.181]  It's uncomplicated.
[01:35:13.122 --> 01:35:16.202]  And that was probably the biggest response that we got.
[01:35:16.242 --> 01:35:18.283]  People said, I just love my Berkey.
[01:35:18.383 --> 01:35:19.624]  It is just so simple.
[01:35:19.784 --> 01:35:21.844]  Yeah, it takes about two minutes to put together.
[01:35:22.304 --> 01:35:26.686]  Takes about two minutes to put together, and every, you know, six months, the filters get clogged up.
[01:35:26.726 --> 01:35:34.368]  It takes about five minutes to clean off the filters, and it's very simple, very uncomplicated, very inexpensive, very economical.
[01:35:35.348 --> 01:35:39.510]  And, uh, but you know, we still get calls from people today that say, gee, Merry Christmas.
[01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:42.892]  You know, I've had my Berkey for five years and I just love this system.
[01:35:42.932 --> 01:35:46.574]  They just call us up to tell us how much they love the system.
[01:35:46.594 --> 01:35:48.615]  And, uh, and that's because it is simple.
[01:35:48.635 --> 01:36:01.962]  You know, a lot of these systems, uh, Alex, uh, first of all, they're not as efficient, but they're extremely complicated and that, you know, they're under the counter and sometimes you've got multi filters to do a lesser job than what we accomplished.
[01:36:02.552 --> 01:36:06.793]  And those different filters have to be changed at different times, and people forget when they bought them.
[01:36:06.813 --> 01:36:08.833]  They don't know when they're supposed to replace things.
[01:36:09.293 --> 01:36:11.574]  And this just takes the headache out of water.
[01:36:11.694 --> 01:36:13.894]  It's just very simple, very automatic.
[01:36:13.914 --> 01:36:18.595]  And the body is 70% water, and the list of poisons that are in the water is just legion.
[01:36:19.135 --> 01:36:20.675]  You've got several different specials.
[01:36:20.735 --> 01:36:21.516]  Tell folks about them.
[01:36:22.196 --> 01:36:24.696]  Okay, we've got the Berkey Light Special.
[01:36:24.736 --> 01:36:26.697]  This is the Berkey Light without the lights.
[01:36:27.397 --> 01:36:27.517]  It's $199.
[01:36:29.426 --> 01:36:42.574]  And with that, folks, if you call up and you mention that Alex Jones sent you, then we will also include your choice of Prudent Places, which is a CD book that has 550 maps.
[01:36:42.654 --> 01:36:48.337]  It has this esoteric information that you simply can't find anywhere else.
[01:36:48.638 --> 01:36:51.339]  You know, where are the rickety bridges if you have to escape your city?
[01:36:51.439 --> 01:36:52.320]  You know, stuff like that.
[01:36:53.126 --> 01:37:02.708]  We also have Shelter in Place, which was put together by a professional who's done work with the government and private industry in the nuclear and biological arena.
[01:37:02.728 --> 01:37:09.970]  But it basically tells you how to turn your house into a shelter if there is some sort of an attack in the United States.
[01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:14.771]  All the government did was wave some duct tape in front of us and later said, ooh, that can actually kill you, don't do that.
[01:37:14.791 --> 01:37:17.752]  So it's a great video, VHS DVD.
[01:37:17.992 --> 01:37:21.953]  And while it was authored by a professional, it was done by a housewife.
[01:37:22.541 --> 01:37:23.101]  I don't think so.
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:59.115]  You get two free gifts, the sheltering in place and as well the prudent places DVD or CD so all of that and if you get the $1.99 Berkey light without the LED light system in the base
[01:37:59.515 --> 01:37:59.635]  It's $1.99.
[01:38:00.276 --> 01:38:02.457]  You've got a bunch of other specials.
[01:38:02.857 --> 01:38:05.578]  Folks, give New Millennium Concepts a call right now.
[01:38:05.639 --> 01:38:07.640]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get these specials.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.341]  Ask about other specials.
[01:38:09.361 --> 01:38:10.201]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:10.321 --> 01:38:13.663]  There's the terrorist threat, but forget that, folks.
[01:38:14.183 --> 01:38:15.624]  Don't run out and buy this just because of that.
[01:38:19.662 --> 01:38:21.223]  Because they're saying, you know, impending attack.
[01:38:21.764 --> 01:38:28.910]  Get it because the water's already full of garbage and once you've been drinking for a few weeks off this, you won't believe you were drinking the tap water once you try to drink it.
[01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:40.019]  So again, 1-888-803-4438 or go to Berkeywater.com and in the comments section, tell them Alex Jones sent you so you get the free gifts.
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:42.701]  So again, Berkeywater.com or Infowars.com
[01:38:43.937 --> 01:38:46.599]  Or 888-803-4438.
[01:38:47.359 --> 01:38:48.300]  Jim, thanks for coming on.
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.160]  Always a pleasure.
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:50.081]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[01:38:50.221 --> 01:38:50.781]  You bet, Jim.
[01:38:50.821 --> 01:38:55.303]  Thank you for employing Americans and moving this to America.
[01:38:56.004 --> 01:39:01.507]  He just took the Berkey water filters from England, which he also sells, and massively improved on it with a Berkey light.
[01:39:02.387 --> 01:39:03.608]  And it's just incredible.
[01:39:03.628 --> 01:39:06.850]  If you call and the phone's busy, leave your name and number, they'll call you right back.
[01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:07.311]  888-803-4438.
[01:39:07.671 --> 01:39:14.075]  Alright, let me hit a few news articles here, then we'll go to these loaded phone lines here.
[01:39:16.037 --> 01:39:24.883]  Security forces were desperately hunting today for an American hostage facing death within hours at the hands of terrorists in Saudi Arabia.
[01:39:26.278 --> 01:39:29.681]  In the past, we don't know if this is LCIA, we don't know what this is.
[01:39:29.741 --> 01:39:32.043]  I mean, the globalists think nothing of human life.
[01:39:32.063 --> 01:39:34.004]  We've caught them doing stuff like this in the past.
[01:39:34.745 --> 01:39:39.529]  The outlook for defense contractor Paul Johnson was quote, grim according to a U.S.
[01:39:39.569 --> 01:39:42.371]  Senator who held emergency talks with a Saudi official.
[01:39:42.872 --> 01:39:52.039]  The hostage takers gave their captives 72 hours to live from Wednesday unless Al Qaeda hostages were released and Westerners left the Arab Peninsula.
[01:39:52.825 --> 01:39:56.966]  Hostage rescue experts have been called in by the authorities in Saudi Arabia.
[01:39:56.986 --> 01:40:02.608]  Remember two weeks ago, the machine gunning that was going on in the Khobar area of Saudi Arabia?
[01:40:02.968 --> 01:40:03.848]  Then it turned out the U.S.
[01:40:03.868 --> 01:40:11.150]  government ordered the terrorist release, ordered the Saudis to back off and let them flee, even after they had already left the hostages and could have been caught.
[01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:16.651]  Remember, I mean, there's been countless of these articles come out.
[01:40:17.552 --> 01:40:18.332]  Very suspicious.
[01:40:19.269 --> 01:40:31.500]  Two senators from Mr. Johnson's home state of New Jersey, Frank Lautenberg and John Corzine, held crisis talks with Abdel Ali Jouber, the former policy advisor to the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah.
[01:40:32.721 --> 01:40:35.804]  And speaking after the meeting with Mr. Lautenberg, he said it's grim.
[01:40:36.184 --> 01:40:40.728]  He said the Saudi authorities said they were doing everything humanly possible to rescue Mr. Johnson.
[01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:45.633]  They have called in experts and hostage rescue teams from the United States to assist them, he told CNN.
[01:40:47.446 --> 01:40:51.469]  He indicated he was not optimistic there would be a successful ending to the hostage crisis.
[01:40:51.609 --> 01:40:54.191]  And again, you're saying, why would the government be involved in this?
[01:40:54.271 --> 01:40:55.752]  We don't know that in this case yet.
[01:40:56.252 --> 01:40:57.773]  But the Berg case, we know.
[01:40:57.853 --> 01:41:02.436]  I mean, their official story's a fraud, and all the evidence points towards the CIA.
[01:41:02.957 --> 01:41:03.997]  With the Nick Berg case.
[01:41:04.438 --> 01:41:05.458]  But we look at motive.
[01:41:05.598 --> 01:41:08.620]  This gets everybody stirred up, gets the approval ratings up for the war.
[01:41:09.161 --> 01:41:10.942]  Oh, look at them, they're killing our people.
[01:41:11.482 --> 01:41:16.586]  But it's great whenever a cluster bomb falls in amongst a bunch of Iraqi children, that's a wonderful thing.
[01:41:17.133 --> 01:41:18.974]  You know, all of this is barbarous and evil.
[01:41:20.235 --> 01:41:22.937]  I mean, our government will drop cluster bombs on weddings, folks.
[01:41:22.957 --> 01:41:26.659]  You don't think they won't grab an innocent guy and have their Arab agents gut him?
[01:41:26.979 --> 01:41:29.281]  When you hear Al-Qaeda, that is CIA.
[01:41:29.341 --> 01:41:30.141]  That's admitted fact.
[01:41:30.501 --> 01:41:31.622]  That's the number one thing we should say.
[01:41:36.671 --> 01:41:37.672]  Oh, there's so much here.
[01:41:38.233 --> 01:41:44.039]  There's a move in states to take your organs, whether you don't want them taken or not.
[01:41:44.499 --> 01:41:53.048]  They've already caught them here in Austin and many other areas around the country taking your eyeballs or corneas when you die, even if you say you don't want your body parts taken.
[01:41:53.609 --> 01:41:57.333]  They've been caught taking people's skins and stealing other organs and sewing you back up.
[01:41:57.693 --> 01:41:58.253]  It's criminal!
[01:41:58.273 --> 01:41:59.515]  They owe us to save lives.
[01:42:01.184 --> 01:42:03.706]  Folks, they will kill you in some hospitals to get your organs.
[01:42:04.046 --> 01:42:07.850]  My dad told me that, and he's in the medical field, a oral surgeon.
[01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:11.553]  He told me that when I was, you know, a teenager in the eighties.
[01:42:12.173 --> 01:42:13.454]  Don't sign the organ donor card.
[01:42:13.474 --> 01:42:19.800]  Then a few years later, I was sitting there on the couch with my grandfather and grandmother and watched 60 Minutes give examples of it.
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:22.222]  I mean, I didn't believe my dad when he told me that.
[01:42:22.822 --> 01:42:26.866]  He said, some hospitals, not a lot of them, but some will kill you.
[01:42:26.926 --> 01:42:28.287]  You come in, can be saved,
[01:42:28.903 --> 01:42:32.706]  They don't help you because they're going to get hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:42:34.788 --> 01:42:35.388]  It's simple.
[01:42:36.529 --> 01:42:49.680]  In fact, I've got an article here about AIDS and hepatitis spreading up in New York because they do these colonoscopies and don't even clean them.
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:52.863]  I don't want to go into too much detail here, but it's pretty gross stuff.
[01:42:53.821 --> 01:42:58.963]  It's like the government still shipping in blood, shipping out blood full of AIDS, AIDS and Hepatitis, and they know it.
[01:42:59.263 --> 01:43:06.566]  Bill Clinton for eight years when he knew the blood from the prisons was filled with it, when it was illegal to ship it out of prisons, kept doing it, certifying it as wholesome.
[01:43:06.806 --> 01:43:08.106]  These people are evil!
[01:43:09.667 --> 01:43:19.891]  Either they're just idiots at these hospitals that don't care about people and are lazy, or it's because they're actively evil and just don't care.
[01:43:22.463 --> 01:43:24.465]  Man, I'm jumping around here, but there's just so much.
[01:43:24.545 --> 01:43:29.609]  September 11th panel wraps, that means criticizes Pentagon Air Defense.
[01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:32.132]  And again, that's a total whitewash.
[01:43:32.472 --> 01:43:35.675]  They know everybody knows about NORAD standing down, so they put their spin on it.
[01:43:36.195 --> 01:43:49.527]  Plagued by miscommunication and confusion, the Pentagon's Air Defense Command missed an opportunity to possibly intercept at least one of the hijacked planes on September 11th, the federal panel reviewing the attack said Thursday.
[01:43:50.911 --> 01:43:52.871]  This is the same panel appointed by Bush.
[01:43:53.712 --> 01:44:00.413]  A report released by the Commission at its final public hearing offered a chilling account of the day America suffered its worst terror attack.
[01:44:01.753 --> 01:44:16.616]  It details a series of missteps by aviation and military officials that squandered precious moments between the time air traffic controllers became aware of the first hijacking and the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 into a Pennsylvania field more than an hour later.
[01:44:17.777 --> 01:44:19.177]  Folks, they knew an hour
[01:44:20.012 --> 01:44:25.916]  In twenty plus minutes before the first plane hit, this has been admitted that they were hijacked.
[01:44:26.077 --> 01:44:31.621]  But then the government grabbed the FAA control tower tapes, five separate ones, and destroyed them.
[01:44:32.281 --> 01:44:32.821]  That's admitted!
[01:44:33.682 --> 01:44:36.304]  Oh, we just thought we needed to grab these and shred them.
[01:44:36.784 --> 01:44:38.746]  We won't tell you where we shredded them or where they are.
[01:44:38.806 --> 01:44:40.147]  Just don't ask us questions.
[01:44:41.483 --> 01:44:48.285]  A particularly haunting section of the report includes transcripts of three brief transmissions from the cockpit of American Airlines Flight 11.
[01:44:48.525 --> 01:44:51.465]  See, they just released snippets, but we shredded the rest.
[01:44:51.905 --> 01:44:55.326]  Which took off from Boston and was the first plane to strike the World Trade Center.
[01:44:55.606 --> 01:45:07.929]  Muhammad Atta, the alleged ringleader of the 19 hijackers, he alleged, folks, who piloted the plane, I thought he was alleged, is heard instructing passengers, just stay quiet, we are returning to the airport.
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:12.121]  And so it goes on and on.
[01:45:12.361 --> 01:45:15.622]  So basically they take this and put out more of their fictions.
[01:45:15.642 --> 01:45:22.104]  A government that creates fake video of Fatman Laden saying, I'm going to get you, later admitted fake.
[01:45:22.304 --> 01:45:24.344]  You can't believe any audio they release, people.
[01:45:25.545 --> 01:45:31.907]  Same Pentagon that has Jerry Bruckheimer producing Saving Private Lynch live on the ground in Iraq.
[01:45:37.287 --> 01:45:43.590]  And there's a lot of other stuff here I need to get to, but there's an article here out of the Star Ledger.
[01:45:45.330 --> 01:45:46.530]  Group aims to hit U.S.
[01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:47.131]  even harder.
[01:45:47.191 --> 01:45:48.631]  Wounded Al-Qaeda aims to hit U.S.
[01:45:48.671 --> 01:45:49.191]  even harder.
[01:45:49.511 --> 01:45:53.192]  They have all these staged captures of low-grade morons at malls.
[01:45:53.732 --> 01:45:56.633]  They have the Fed walk over and go, we ought to blow stuff up!
[01:45:56.773 --> 01:46:01.875]  And then claim the person mumbled, yeah, when the person doesn't even own a car and can't speak English.
[01:46:01.915 --> 01:46:03.795]  And then, oh, we foiled a big attack!
[01:46:03.815 --> 01:46:06.976]  And then months later it'll be in the back of the paper that, oh, he was actually innocent.
[01:46:07.576 --> 01:46:09.177]  Same thing in England on a weekly basis.
[01:46:09.697 --> 01:46:12.320]  But it creates the atmosphere of, ooh, we're under attack, we're in danger.
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:22.911]  Since the 9-11 attacks, Al Qaeda has become decentralized to its base in Afghanistan, seen many of its leaders and financiers captured or killed, and had its funding base devastated.
[01:46:23.191 --> 01:46:26.955]  Still, according to a report issued yesterday by the 9-11 Commission, U.S.
[01:46:26.995 --> 01:46:32.241]  intelligence authorities expect the trend towards attacks intended to cause ever higher casualties will continue.
[01:46:33.843 --> 01:46:45.228]  And we see these articles, you know, 50 times a day, but then next, the Business Times says, oh, these wild conspiracy theorists said there's going to be a new terror attack, and say the Fed is preparing for terror attacks.
[01:46:46.048 --> 01:46:47.989]  But this is all just, you know, propaganda.
[01:46:48.610 --> 01:46:51.551]  The Fed doesn't have news of another September 11th attack, does it?
[01:46:51.811 --> 01:47:01.035]  IT that says it must say something about fear and greed that normally sane people take leave of their senses to construct financial market conspiracy theories.
[01:47:01.647 --> 01:47:10.556]  Some of the theories, embarrassing as it may seem, this is them setting it up to blame it on, you know, talk show hosts and people when the attacks, if they don't happen, when the government put the reports out.
[01:47:10.937 --> 01:47:13.920]  Some of these theories, embarrassing as it would seem, find their way into print.
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:23.290]  A recent conspiracy theory, making the rounds, concerns the surge of money supply, growth, and watch-the-web-being-spun implementation that the Fed must know something.
[01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:27.853]  So they admit they're printing record money, but you're a conspiracy theorist to say it has something to do with terror.
[01:47:27.873 --> 01:47:29.734]  According to this line of thinking, the U.S.
[01:47:29.754 --> 01:47:37.939]  Federal Reserve is flooding the banking system with reserves in the same way that it did following the September 11th attacks, except this time it's anticipating the event.
[01:47:38.419 --> 01:47:50.987]  Two weeks ago, Safe Haven posted an alarming analysis of its website warning of the unpredicted, unheard of, pre-catastrophe of M3 money supply expansion.
[01:47:51.707 --> 01:47:52.968]  Then it goes into all of that.
[01:47:53.652 --> 01:47:55.193]  It's just a lot of weird stuff.
[01:47:55.373 --> 01:47:56.613]  Let's take a few calls here.
[01:47:57.454 --> 01:47:59.034]  Quickly, folks, because I've got a lot of you.
[01:47:59.535 --> 01:48:01.636]  Let's talk to... who's up next here?
[01:48:02.976 --> 01:48:04.837]  Gabe in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:48:06.278 --> 01:48:08.719]  Yes, Alex, I'd like to just ask you a couple questions.
[01:48:08.759 --> 01:48:10.659]  I've been hearing a lot of... Yeah, do me a big favor first.
[01:48:10.699 --> 01:48:11.720]  Get off your speaker phone.
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:13.901]  Oh, I want a cell phone.
[01:48:14.221 --> 01:48:16.262]  Okay, well it sounds like you're 15 feet away, but go ahead.
[01:48:16.906 --> 01:48:28.995]  Okay, well, the first thing I want to know is I've been hearing a lot of chatter on shortwave about the naval deployment, and I went to Google and tried to search the net on some information, I really couldn't find it, I've just been hearing it on shortwave, and that's my first question.
[01:48:29.015 --> 01:48:38.282]  Yeah, about three weeks ago, about three weeks ago, the Associated Press reported a large naval maneuver, a bunch of aircraft carriers put into sea, and it is confirmed.
[01:48:39.093 --> 01:48:41.494]  It's been in a bunch of newspapers.
[01:48:41.875 --> 01:48:47.198]  It's the largest naval deployment in the history of the U.S.
[01:48:47.218 --> 01:48:48.398]  93% of the Eastern Fleet launched.
[01:48:48.999 --> 01:48:51.320]  Sir, I'm trying to answer your question.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:53.141]  What keyword did you type in?
[01:48:54.182 --> 01:48:56.803]  Naval deployment, U.S., North Korea.
[01:48:58.144 --> 01:48:59.264]  I wouldn't do that.
[01:49:00.785 --> 01:49:07.229]  I would type in East Coast aircraft carrier deployment.
[01:49:08.553 --> 01:49:08.834]  Okay.
[01:49:09.195 --> 01:49:11.100]  And one more question I have to ask.
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:13.387]  What ever happened to the RFID chips in those $20 bills?
[01:49:15.214 --> 01:49:18.135]  Well, they are still in some of the $20 bills.
[01:49:18.175 --> 01:49:18.796]  We've confirmed it.
[01:49:18.816 --> 01:49:31.902]  They're not in all of them, and it's a type of magnetic ink, which if you type in RFID laid down in ink, you'll have Hewlett-Packard and Hitachi announcements about two years ago where they admit they have this.
[01:49:32.342 --> 01:49:33.482]  Was it a certain U.S.
[01:49:33.562 --> 01:49:35.323]  Mint that was distributing that, or was it the U.S.
[01:49:35.343 --> 01:49:35.423]  Mint?
[01:49:35.503 --> 01:49:38.144]  They don't let you into the finer workings of the U.S.
[01:49:38.204 --> 01:49:39.365]  Mint, and we don't know.
[01:49:39.405 --> 01:49:44.007]  We know that Euro notes also popped and caught on fire, but only some of them.
[01:49:45.126 --> 01:49:45.887]  Hmm, okay.
[01:49:47.988 --> 01:49:49.410]  Alrighty, thank you for the call.
[01:49:49.890 --> 01:49:51.591]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[01:49:51.612 --> 01:49:52.592]  We've got time here.
[01:49:52.652 --> 01:49:53.253]  I'm hurrying.
[01:49:54.134 --> 01:49:55.595]  Mary in Missouri.
[01:49:55.615 --> 01:49:56.215]  Go ahead, Mary.
[01:49:56.516 --> 01:49:57.556]  I'll try to be real quick.
[01:49:57.677 --> 01:49:57.997]  Okay.
[01:49:58.177 --> 01:49:58.758]  Two questions.
[01:49:59.078 --> 01:50:08.426]  Yesterday on the news here in Kansas City, there was a 68-year-old woman and a 74-year-old man, husband and wife, and they were coming home.
[01:50:08.466 --> 01:50:10.547]  The wife of the woman was coming home with her sister.
[01:50:11.835 --> 01:50:22.138]  Sister's car was parked on the wrong side of the street, and when the police were entering, a disturbance called... Yeah, she honked her car at the car, she got out, and the cop didn't like it, and tasered her in front of witnesses.
[01:50:22.258 --> 01:50:32.580]  And then the husband came downstairs, turning his wife, you know, screaming, he jumped on the cop as a defense against his wife, and they tasered him and took him off in his pajamas.
[01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:36.261]  Well, as slaves, we've got to learn how to take abuse.
[01:50:37.153 --> 01:50:37.534]  Yeah.
[01:50:37.594 --> 01:50:43.983]  Again, I mean, being sarcastic, but in the 1830s, you know, the black person had to take the beating.
[01:50:44.463 --> 01:50:45.184]  Your break, please.
[01:50:45.204 --> 01:50:47.488]  Could you say what happened to Fritz Springmeier?
[01:50:48.048 --> 01:50:48.549]  I don't know.
[01:50:48.609 --> 01:50:49.791]  The guy just called in about it.
[01:50:49.811 --> 01:50:51.754]  I tell you what, just stay there.
[01:50:53.607 --> 01:50:57.954]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.154 --> 01:51:02.581]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:02.701 --> 01:51:07.108]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:07.148 --> 01:51:08.510]  The New World Order.
[01:51:09.231 --> 01:51:10.071]  Panama.
[01:51:10.272 --> 01:51:14.493]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.533 --> 01:51:21.476]  We've ripped the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.616 --> 01:51:23.697]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:23.997 --> 01:51:34.401]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.601 --> 01:51:35.862]  If you want to understand what the new
[01:51:35.862 --> 01:51:36.082]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:57.130]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:51:57.350 --> 01:52:02.791]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:52:03.071 --> 01:52:13.433]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:52:13.593 --> 01:52:17.934]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:52:18.134 --> 01:52:21.715]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine
[01:52:21.715 --> 01:52:22.195]  We're good.
[01:52:51.795 --> 01:52:52.055]  I think so.
[01:53:09.708 --> 01:53:10.349]  We're good to go!
[01:53:39.227 --> 01:53:42.330]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:53:42.490 --> 01:53:48.435]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:59.265 --> 01:54:03.068]  Sorry if I sound irritated when I try to jam a bunch of calls in so I can get to all the news.
[01:54:03.088 --> 01:54:05.070]  We've got a guest coming up the next hour.
[01:54:05.110 --> 01:54:06.131]  I get a little bit frustrated.
[01:54:07.396 --> 01:54:09.218]  I just understood your question after we went into break.
[01:54:09.238 --> 01:54:09.758]  I understood it.
[01:54:09.778 --> 01:54:14.722]  You're asking what happened to Fritz Springmeier, not about the caller earlier saying his wife's phone number's changed.
[01:54:15.763 --> 01:54:17.724]  Is that what you were trying to ask, Mary?
[01:54:18.004 --> 01:54:19.125]  Yes, and I'd like to know this.
[01:54:19.185 --> 01:54:20.506]  I'm listening to you every day.
[01:54:20.926 --> 01:54:24.089]  Just check it out and also give a little bio on who he is, okay?
[01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:28.412]  Okay, well, I can't do everything, ma'am, but we do carry one of his books, Bloodlines of the Illuminati.
[01:54:28.432 --> 01:54:29.273]  Okay, that's good.
[01:54:29.313 --> 01:54:30.594]  It was published here in Austin.
[01:54:31.355 --> 01:54:35.459]  And, uh, Fritz Springmeier was obviously framed for bank robbery.
[01:54:35.499 --> 01:54:36.900]  The guy never committed any crimes.
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:37.560]  Alright.
[01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:44.766]  He was framed for bank robbery by an informant for the government because he's writing these books exposing who actually runs the New World Order.
[01:54:45.206 --> 01:54:49.490]  And he's in a federal prison, I think, serving a seven and a half year sentence in Oregon.
[01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:50.411]  Oh my.
[01:54:50.631 --> 01:54:50.931]  Okay.
[01:54:50.951 --> 01:54:51.812]  Does that answer your question?
[01:54:51.992 --> 01:54:52.352]  Thank you.
[01:54:52.392 --> 01:54:52.693]  Bye.
[01:54:52.733 --> 01:54:53.413]  Thank you for the call.
[01:54:53.453 --> 01:54:54.214]  Great question.
[01:54:55.201 --> 01:55:00.543]  And, you know, on the issue of these naval deployments, the caller calls in and says, well, I've searched Google and can't find it.
[01:55:01.123 --> 01:55:02.204]  It's all over the Internet.
[01:55:02.404 --> 01:55:07.726]  You know, mainstream news articles, alternative news articles, and I can lead a horse to water, but I can't make you drink.
[01:55:08.666 --> 01:55:13.048]  And, you know, we post the stuff on the site, then a new front page gets posted every day.
[01:55:13.088 --> 01:55:14.028]  It's like a newspaper.
[01:55:14.529 --> 01:55:17.470]  Just go back in the archives a couple weeks ago and just look around.
[01:55:17.490 --> 01:55:20.431]  I mean, all the time when I want to pull another article up, that's what I do.
[01:55:21.144 --> 01:55:23.305]  But I can't always do it live here on air.
[01:55:23.325 --> 01:55:24.665]  You know, what's this guy's phone number?
[01:55:24.685 --> 01:55:25.085]  What's that?
[01:55:25.125 --> 01:55:25.625]  You know, what's this?
[01:55:25.665 --> 01:55:28.126]  I'm like, uh, I don't have that good of a memory.
[01:55:28.966 --> 01:55:39.028]  Let's talk to, tell you what, I'm going to do five minutes into the next hour, and then we've got the guests coming on, getting into chemical and biological weapons and these plants they're building around the country.
[01:55:39.068 --> 01:55:39.888]  It's so important.
[01:55:39.908 --> 01:55:41.369]  We're going to go back over it.
[01:55:42.269 --> 01:55:43.169]  Covered it last week.
[01:55:44.109 --> 01:55:50.531]  But we'll come back in the next little five minute segment and talk to Kelly and others, the first segment of the next hour.
[01:55:51.983 --> 01:55:59.590]  But before I do that, I mean, if you want to have a hard copy of these news articles, these documents, the things we talk about, they're all on the website.
[01:56:00.951 --> 01:56:08.998]  And every week I do multiple television shows, and some weeks we put both live TV shows, the tapes of them on the web, some weeks it's just one.
[01:56:09.038 --> 01:56:10.500]  I put all my films on the internet.

[01:56:53.196 --> 01:56:54.097]  It's having an effect.
[01:56:54.477 --> 01:56:56.318]  Air the films again on AXS TV.
[01:56:56.759 --> 01:56:57.880]  Get my newest films.
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.702]  Police State, Three Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil.

[01:57:12.491 --> 01:57:19.136]  Remember Bush slipped up early this year and said, we're bringing chaos and we can then bring order, you know, order out of chaos.
[01:57:19.717 --> 01:57:20.718]  That's their maxim.
[01:57:21.618 --> 01:57:22.619]  That's their standard.
[01:57:22.659 --> 01:57:23.420]  That's what they do.
[01:57:24.733 --> 01:57:25.593]  Go to the website.
[01:57:25.714 --> 01:57:26.974]  Peruse the shopping carts.
[01:57:27.074 --> 01:57:28.295]  Watch the free video clips.
[01:57:28.315 --> 01:57:30.776]  I mean, I've got 20-30 minute clips of the films.
[01:57:30.836 --> 01:57:32.357]  The films are all over two hours long.
[01:57:32.897 --> 01:57:35.658]  Well, you order three or more of any of the ten films I've made.
[01:57:35.678 --> 01:57:37.199]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[01:57:37.559 --> 01:57:39.260]  And you're authorized to make copies of my films.
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:44.903]  You're not authorized to make copies of all the other great films I carry by other authors and researchers.
[01:57:44.923 --> 01:57:46.603]  Because I can't authorize you to do that.
[01:57:46.643 --> 01:57:47.864]  I get requests all the time.
[01:57:47.884 --> 01:57:48.744]  Can I copy this tape?
[01:57:49.064 --> 01:57:49.825]  No, it's not mine.
[01:57:49.905 --> 01:57:50.325]  Ask them.
[01:57:50.685 --> 01:57:52.166]  But my ten videos, you can.
[01:57:52.916 --> 01:57:54.718]  So, again, call toll free, folks.
[01:57:54.738 --> 01:57:56.019]  Your support is also needed.
[01:57:56.039 --> 01:57:56.239]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:56.279 --> 01:57:56.979]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:57:56.999 --> 01:58:00.042]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:58:16.525 --> 01:58:28.130]  You cannot imagine the effect it has when you get the videos, make a couple copies of them a piece, give them to talk show hosts, county commissioners, city council, the sheriff, your pastor, your rabbi.
[01:58:28.890 --> 01:58:31.231]  It's now time to do this!
[01:58:32.011 --> 01:58:37.073]  We have the power, we're the people, if we move against evil, with God's help, it can't stand!
[01:58:37.734 --> 01:58:40.815]  Alright, third hour, more calls, a great guest coming up, stay with us.
[01:58:43.866 --> 01:58:47.328]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[01:58:47.608 --> 01:58:51.109]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:55.131]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:58:55.351 --> 01:59:01.513]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:01.934 --> 01:59:09.837]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:59:10.257 --> 01:59:15.581]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:59:15.762 --> 01:59:19.525]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:59:49.967 --> 01:59:50.647]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.268 --> 01:59:52.369]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.049 --> 01:59:54.190]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.210 --> 01:59:55.651]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.371 --> 01:59:57.312]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.332 --> 02:00:01.595]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.135 --> 02:00:06.198]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:08.571]  That's right, my friends.
[02:00:08.631 --> 02:00:09.171]  We're live.
[02:00:09.192 --> 02:00:12.256]  It's Thursday, the 17th day of June, 2004.
[02:00:13.217 --> 02:00:14.319]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:00:14.339 --> 02:00:15.801]  We're about to go to Kelly in Texas.
[02:00:16.502 --> 02:00:17.584]  Before I do that, though...
[02:00:18.687 --> 02:00:31.403]  In Europe, every couple of weeks I see an article where some government minister criticizes the fact that they're getting rid of juries, secretly arresting people, spying on everyone, doing the same stuff that they're doing now in this country.
[02:00:31.463 --> 02:00:37.351]  But even on a wider scale, while talking about how evil America is, again it's all this good cop, bad cop behavior,
[02:00:39.176 --> 02:00:42.900]  And they say, oh, you're not for a Klan member saying bad things about black people, are you?
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:44.161]  Oh, let's take their free speech.
[02:00:44.201 --> 02:00:47.905]  Well, in Europe, it's, you're not for a neo-Nazi saying bad things about Jews.
[02:00:47.965 --> 02:00:55.072]  Well, I know, I don't particularly agree with that, but I agree with their First Amendment right to say that because of the...
[02:00:55.592 --> 02:01:01.217]  If they're free speech right in Europe, because if you take that Yahoo's right, then I lose my right.
[02:01:01.237 --> 02:01:10.684]  I mean, France was arresting people and trying to stop, uh, speaking of Yahoo, the Yahoo website from allowing people to have shopping carts selling World War II memorabilia.
[02:01:11.045 --> 02:01:13.627]  You know, uh, Purple Hearts, Iron Crosses.
[02:01:13.647 --> 02:01:15.288]  I mean, that's interesting stuff!
[02:01:16.349 --> 02:01:21.313]  I mean, 99% of people buying that stuff aren't Nazis, but even if they were, so what?
[02:01:22.498 --> 02:01:24.539]  I mean, that'd be pretty neat if I was a collector.
[02:01:24.579 --> 02:01:25.720]  I might collect stuff like that.
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:28.621]  In fact, once I was at a big collector deal.
[02:01:28.661 --> 02:01:32.803]  They had stamps and medals and stuff, and I bought an American medal, and I bought a German medal.
[02:01:33.123 --> 02:01:34.644]  They're somewhere in storage.
[02:01:34.664 --> 02:01:35.745]  I think they're neat.
[02:01:36.645 --> 02:01:39.146]  But I think history's interesting.
[02:01:39.687 --> 02:01:41.728]  Anti-Hate Net Conference opens.
[02:01:42.888 --> 02:01:50.532]  Experts gather in Paris on Wednesday, seeking a common approach to the UN, I would add, combating racist, anti-Semitic, and xenophobic.
[02:01:50.972 --> 02:01:51.693]  Now, they've arrested
[02:01:54.214 --> 02:02:01.176]  English farmers who use the old pounds measurement instead of the metric and they say that's racism, that's xenophobic.
[02:02:01.376 --> 02:02:02.456]  Folks, that's the mainstream news.
[02:02:02.496 --> 02:02:07.517]  They arrested a BBC reporter who said that farmers deserve the same rights as Muslims and gays.
[02:02:07.957 --> 02:02:11.618]  And they said, oh, he said the word homosexual actually and that's a hate word in England.
[02:02:12.018 --> 02:02:15.278]  We have articles where hundreds of homes are raided by hate forces.
[02:02:16.298 --> 02:02:19.459]  So again, it's not just the... See, at first it's the Nazis, then it's everybody.
[02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:24.110]  And it says, believed to be a chief factor in rising numbers of hate crimes.
[02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:24.410]  See?
[02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:34.232]  Officials from more than 60 countries were attending the two-day conference aimed at finding ways to keep racist information off the web without compromising free speech and freedom of expression.
[02:02:34.772 --> 02:02:46.755]  And again, they want the UN to come in on a global scale and regulate, tough global regulation, shown by the widespread illegal sharing of music online that has confounded record companies.
[02:02:46.775 --> 02:02:49.456]  So see, there's other needs for global regulation, they say.
[02:02:50.530 --> 02:02:54.893]  And they say that they've got to go in and shut all this down.
[02:02:55.814 --> 02:02:58.495]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Kelly in Texas.
[02:02:58.535 --> 02:02:59.156]  Kelly, go ahead.
[02:02:59.756 --> 02:03:03.519]  Yes, I just wanted to say it's good to hear you on the program every day and at night.
[02:03:03.619 --> 02:03:09.723]  And if I was in Austin, where would I get your... could I come down to downtown and get the videos if I happen to be there?
[02:03:09.743 --> 02:03:11.544]  Like if I'm... you know what I'm saying?
[02:03:11.964 --> 02:03:13.005]  Well, where do you live?
[02:03:13.846 --> 02:03:14.746]  I'm going to Austin soon.
[02:03:14.786 --> 02:03:20.010]  I live in Seminole, Texas, but I'm just saying if I'm down there... The only place that sells my videos on the ground in Austin
[02:03:20.644 --> 02:03:24.598]  Is the hardware store incorporated at the corner of Spicewood Springs Road and 183?
[02:03:26.118 --> 02:03:28.980]  Okay, I also wanted to say about the guy that called in yesterday talking about it.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:29.781]  Well, that's not true.
[02:03:29.801 --> 02:03:33.243]  A bunch of the video rental places have my videos in them, but they don't sell them.
[02:03:33.503 --> 02:03:34.544]  And they would.
[02:03:34.644 --> 02:03:36.805]  They call me wanting to buy them, and I don't even call them back.
[02:03:36.965 --> 02:03:37.906]  That's how busy I am.
[02:03:37.926 --> 02:03:39.587]  I don't have the money for the staff, but go ahead.
[02:03:39.607 --> 02:03:43.049]  I don't have the money to make money, which I need to fight the New World Order, but go ahead.
[02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:49.193]  And the guy that called in yesterday talking about an Air Force jet or something that came in, like, right as the plane was hitting.
[02:03:49.254 --> 02:03:50.274]  That's on tape, yeah.
[02:03:50.434 --> 02:03:53.136]  Yeah, and again, also about the jet not having the windows.
[02:03:53.176 --> 02:03:55.197]  Why would the people get on the jet if it had no windows?
[02:03:56.839 --> 02:03:57.980]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:07.308]  And also, I've recently been reading about people trying to blame some of this terrorism on like heavy metal and all this stuff, you know, music and stuff, the negativity of it all and all that.
[02:04:07.328 --> 02:04:08.709]  It's just another scapegoat.
[02:04:08.989 --> 02:04:14.814]  But again, they'll only regulate you and I. They won't actually go after all that stuff, and they shouldn't.
[02:04:14.855 --> 02:04:15.495]  It's free speech.
[02:04:16.116 --> 02:04:16.656]  Okay, thank you.
[02:04:16.676 --> 02:04:18.157]  Hey, good to hear from you, man.
[02:04:18.237 --> 02:04:18.998]  Great points.
[02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:20.399]  Alright, we've got this guest coming up.
[02:04:20.439 --> 02:04:23.322]  This is one of the most important issues that can be discussed.
[02:04:23.914 --> 02:04:25.275]  So please stay with us.
[02:04:25.375 --> 02:04:26.515]  Sorry I've been moving so quick.
[02:04:26.555 --> 02:04:30.356]  It's just there's so much news today I wanted to get to before this guest came on.
[02:04:31.497 --> 02:04:32.897]  And there's so much that we didn't cover.
[02:04:33.758 --> 02:04:35.418]  But we'll get to more of it coming up.
[02:04:35.938 --> 02:04:39.340]  And again I'll be back tonight 9 to midnight central and back tomorrow 11 to 2.
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:41.700]  But coming up is a great guest so stay with us.
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:42.781]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:04:45.467 --> 02:04:46.968]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:47.168 --> 02:04:50.251]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:04:50.371 --> 02:04:54.274]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:04:54.334 --> 02:04:58.558]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:04:58.918 --> 02:05:02.681]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:05:02.781 --> 02:05:04.623]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:05:05.203 --> 02:05:08.126]  Police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:05:08.166 --> 02:05:12.870]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:05:13.050 --> 02:05:16.092]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:05:16.273 --> 02:05:19.155]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:05:19.616 --> 02:05:25.741]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:05:26.261 --> 02:05:30.045]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:05:30.465 --> 02:05:31.826]  Order your video today.
[02:05:32.226 --> 02:05:33.207]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:05:33.267 --> 02:05:35.249]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[02:05:45.131 --> 02:05:48.213]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[02:05:48.413 --> 02:05:51.455]  Don't underestimate the urgency of the need to become self-sufficient.
[02:05:51.615 --> 02:05:57.699]  In our kit, we're sending you 25 pounds of organic red winter wheat, and that's nearly a year of high-potency wheatgrass juice.
[02:05:57.919 --> 02:06:03.163]  The book, Wheatgrass Nature's Finest Medicine, and our beautiful stainless steel wheatgrass juicer.
[02:06:03.343 --> 02:06:07.986]  But most importantly, we are professional wheatgrass growers, and I am going to be your contact
[02:06:08.186 --> 02:06:15.368]  To walk you through the process of successfully growing your continuing self-supply of full-scale nutrition from pennies worth of grain.
[02:06:15.488 --> 02:06:21.209]  So call 1-877-MY-WHEAT or go to austinwheatgrass.com.
[02:06:21.409 --> 02:06:27.331]  Growing your own wheatgrass is not as easy as some would have you think and we've learned this the hard way through five years of growing experience.
[02:06:27.491 --> 02:06:29.472]  And we're going to pass on to you our knowledge.
[02:06:29.612 --> 02:06:30.952]  Don't settle for anything less.
[02:06:31.232 --> 02:06:32.753]  Call me and get the real details.
[02:06:32.773 --> 02:06:33.034]  1-877-MY-WHEAT.
[02:06:33.134 --> 02:06:33.454]  That's 1-877-699-4328.
[02:06:33.574 --> 02:06:38.037]  And as always, we thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[02:06:44.457 --> 02:06:46.078]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:46.198 --> 02:06:50.321]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:06:50.461 --> 02:06:53.323]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:06:53.423 --> 02:07:00.127]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:07:00.307 --> 02:07:03.309]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:07:03.529 --> 02:07:05.911]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:07:06.031 --> 02:07:10.754]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:07:10.934 --> 02:07:20.237]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur.
[02:07:20.397 --> 02:07:25.519]  Even Nitrates and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are Extracted.
[02:07:25.659 --> 02:07:32.301]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-Pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-Pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[02:07:35.842 --> 02:07:36.583]  803-4438.
[02:07:36.643 --> 02:07:39.185]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:07:45.289 --> 02:07:50.332]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:50.712 --> 02:07:53.034]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:56.016 --> 02:08:00.539]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:08:03.096 --> 02:08:12.199]  And I'm honored to be joined by the president of the San Francisco Bay Physicians for Social Responsibility.
[02:08:13.539 --> 02:08:26.363]  I was reading a Sunshine Project document concerning the fact that these Level 4 bioweapons labs, the BioShield, you know, five plus billion dollars of funding Bush got to build three dozen Level 4 bioweapons labs.
[02:08:27.423 --> 02:08:29.464]  James Weapons Publications have talked about this.
[02:08:29.484 --> 02:08:32.425]  This is a cover for a weapons production
[02:08:33.647 --> 02:08:42.216]  And PNAC and others talk about race-specific bioweapons, and we know Israel, the US, England, the Russians, others have been developing this.
[02:08:42.917 --> 02:08:49.264]  And it's very frightening, and much more dangerous, frankly, than nuclear weapons, my friends.
[02:08:50.205 --> 02:08:53.048]  Because once it's out, it's out of control.
[02:08:53.786 --> 02:08:56.987]  And he's Dr. Robert Gould.
[02:08:57.067 --> 02:09:00.329]  He is a pathologist, and it's good to have him on with us.
[02:09:00.809 --> 02:09:01.529]  Doctor, welcome.
[02:09:02.509 --> 02:09:03.750]  My pleasure to be on, Alex.
[02:09:03.770 --> 02:09:04.770]  Thanks for having me.
[02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:05.571]  Oh, you bet.
[02:09:05.651 --> 02:09:06.531]  It's an honor to have you.
[02:09:06.831 --> 02:09:17.015]  I mean, regardless of what political bent somebody's a part of, our government shakes their fists at all these third world dustbins who don't even have
[02:09:17.555 --> 02:09:22.901]  Well, this is one of the major issues that are definitely hitting our country and the world in terms of what the United States position has been on.
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:53.648]  As regarding how do we control the new technologies in particular, how do we keep these new technologies, genetic modification, and a lot of other similar types of genetic engineering techniques from being used to develop new biological weapons.
[02:09:54.288 --> 02:09:55.849]  Right now, according to the
[02:09:59.476 --> 02:10:12.001]  General American Medical Association, an article that came out at the end of the 1990s, there are about 70 different organisms that we know right now have the potential for being biological weapons.
[02:10:12.081 --> 02:10:13.962]  This is before any modification.
[02:10:14.182 --> 02:10:20.884]  These include various bacteria, viruses, fungal organisms, and others.
[02:10:21.284 --> 02:10:24.105]  And for these organisms, only about 30% of them
[02:10:26.050 --> 02:10:26.290]  All right.
[02:10:45.441 --> 02:10:45.521]  Yes.
[02:11:04.433 --> 02:11:11.699]  Governments or other actors are going to start using the genetic modification techniques.
[02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:18.405]  Organisms could be developed that would be resistant to any sort of antibiotic or vaccine.
[02:11:18.845 --> 02:11:31.396]  And this is the extreme danger of the type of work that the United States is entertaining doing in its plans for developing a nationwide system of so-called biodefense labs.
[02:11:32.071 --> 02:11:39.954]  And we'll talk about, I mean, obviously in the black budget shadow programs, this is massive, it's going on, but now they're going public with it.
[02:11:40.774 --> 02:11:43.495]  The Boston newspapers have talked about it.
[02:11:43.815 --> 02:11:49.237]  The big Washington papers have discussed it.
[02:11:49.697 --> 02:11:54.459]  In one article in the Baltimore Sun, they said they're going to produce thousands of gallons of liquid death.
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:59.381]  That they're building these dangerous things that are more dangerous than nuclear power plants, folks.
[02:11:59.741 --> 02:12:01.822]  All over our communities, three dozen of them.
[02:12:02.102 --> 02:12:03.602]  But let's give people a case point example.
[02:12:03.622 --> 02:12:17.646]  A couple years ago, through universities and the government in Australia, they take this mouse pox, kills all the mice that come in contact with it, and they put out the recipe for it and say, oh, this can be made for any mammal.
[02:12:18.447 --> 02:12:22.908]  I mean, why on earth would they release the ingredients to this?
[02:12:24.173 --> 02:12:31.299]  Well, it's a good question, and it really points to the dangerous nature of such type of experiments.
[02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:35.603]  You know, there's additional evidence pointing to these problems.
[02:12:35.643 --> 02:12:50.056]  A number of years ago, the old biological weapons facility in Great Britain, the Porton Downs facility, was reported to have violated its own lab guidelines and synthesized a combination of dengue fever
[02:12:50.804 --> 02:12:54.119]  And hepatitis, an organism made of those two
[02:12:54.659 --> 02:12:57.061]  That would likely be more dangerous than AIDS.
[02:12:57.201 --> 02:12:58.402]  And that's just what we know about.
[02:12:58.742 --> 02:13:11.170]  Were you aware that four years ago, it was in Sky Television, London Telegraph as well, that, oh, by the way, we think we accidentally released, or somebody stole, weaponized foot and mouth, and then that's what caused that whole crisis.
[02:13:11.210 --> 02:13:14.052]  So, oh, this stuff could be accidentally released?
[02:13:14.172 --> 02:13:15.693]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:13:16.113 --> 02:13:21.717]  Well, accidents can always happen, and that's why we really need to get control over these organisms.
[02:13:22.017 --> 02:13:26.939]  A Russian scientist just died who got exposed to Ebola in a lab.
[02:13:27.199 --> 02:13:27.739]  That's correct.
[02:13:27.799 --> 02:13:30.480]  That happened in Russia.
[02:13:31.180 --> 02:13:36.842]  And you know, the thing is, this is the reason why a lot of community organizations around the country
[02:13:37.423 --> 02:13:42.607]  For very good reason, are opposing the siting of labs in their communities.
[02:13:42.707 --> 02:13:44.748]  Where are some of the places they want to build these three dozen?
[02:13:45.048 --> 02:13:57.917]  Well, first off, you know, just for your listeners, if they want to get the best information of where the plans are, the Sunshine Project at www.sunshineproject.org.
[02:13:58.017 --> 02:14:00.479]  We have a link to the subsection, by the way, on InfoWars.com.
[02:14:00.499 --> 02:14:06.363]  That's terrific, because they've just developed, and they've been doing a series of updated maps of what the proposed
[02:14:07.630 --> 02:14:12.795]  Uh, biodefense facilities are around the country and just came out with one, uh, within the last two weeks.
[02:14:12.815 --> 02:14:18.941]  So I'd really urge the, uh, listeners to log on and actually see for themselves what the various plans are.
[02:14:19.491 --> 02:14:25.073]  But there are plans, as indicated on those maps, to put these facilities all around the country.
[02:14:25.233 --> 02:14:30.976]  And so, for example, there are proposals to build one in conjunction with Boston University.
[02:14:31.456 --> 02:14:37.118]  They already have started it at UT down on the coast.
[02:14:37.298 --> 02:14:37.958]  That's correct.
[02:14:38.278 --> 02:14:44.521]  And despite very strenuous efforts by folks at Sunshine,
[02:14:45.266 --> 02:14:45.606]  I think?
[02:15:04.821 --> 02:15:05.061]  I think
[02:15:23.749 --> 02:15:26.050]  And it's in the middle of a major metropolitan area.
[02:15:26.170 --> 02:15:28.610]  And a plane could crash into it?
[02:15:28.630 --> 02:15:30.571]  A gas main could blow up?
[02:15:30.631 --> 02:15:31.411]  Anything could happen.
[02:15:31.431 --> 02:15:37.173]  Just as we're seeing with this recent anthrax problem, lab accidents do happen.
[02:15:38.493 --> 02:15:43.074]  A number of years ago, myself and some colleagues who've written on this,
[02:15:43.849 --> 02:15:44.070]  I think?
[02:15:53.766 --> 02:15:58.370]  quote-unquote biodefense lab who came down with the case of Glanders that he was working with.
[02:15:58.751 --> 02:16:05.797]  Glanders is a disease that's not contagious, but nonetheless it wasn't diagnosed until he was out in the community.
[02:16:06.317 --> 02:16:10.881]  Yeah, that's what's going to happen, and are you familiar with Jane's weapons publications?
[02:16:11.002 --> 02:16:17.828]  Yes, I mean I don't read it regularly, but I know of... They are the premier, I mean they told us about the B-2 bomber years before it came out.
[02:16:18.688 --> 02:16:22.951]  They put out a rare alert last year going, look, Israel, England, and the U.S.
[02:16:23.111 --> 02:16:24.993]  are developing race-specific bioweapons.
[02:16:25.313 --> 02:16:27.594]  This is totally dangerous and totally evil.
[02:16:27.935 --> 02:16:31.997]  And then PNAC talked about, oh, we need to discuss the use of this in warfare.
[02:16:32.017 --> 02:16:33.618]  I mean, were you aware of that?
[02:16:34.059 --> 02:16:37.761]  Well, I'd be a little cautious on the race-specific weapons.
[02:16:37.841 --> 02:16:43.385]  I know that there have been people who've been planning, you know, think that this might be a good idea.
[02:16:43.405 --> 02:16:44.205]  South Africa?
[02:16:44.225 --> 02:16:46.387]  South Africans, for example, were reported.
[02:16:47.151 --> 02:17:04.898]  During the coverage of the so-called Dr. Death, the physician who'd worked with South African intelligence and as well in developing biological weapons programs for use in Zimbabwe and Rhodesia, that they were working on this.
[02:17:04.938 --> 02:17:08.179]  But we have to remember that the human beings, despite our
[02:17:08.672 --> 02:17:13.776]  Racial and ethnic differences share more genetic similarities than differences.
[02:17:13.876 --> 02:17:34.414]  So, there are major problems, theoretically, in being able to develop... But now that the genome has been published with IBM and the government... But the point is, Alex, is that there's still, even if we have a published genome, there's still, and it has been discovered from a lot of the genetic research, including the genetic mapping,
[02:17:34.847 --> 02:17:41.032]  That we share more genes, much more genes, for individual to individual, race to race, than we differ.
[02:17:41.132 --> 02:17:44.736]  Well, I agree, but my point is, doctor, they're working on these systems.
[02:17:45.016 --> 02:17:47.118]  We have evidence that this stuff can be released.
[02:17:47.378 --> 02:17:48.579]  We have a track record of that.
[02:17:48.799 --> 02:17:50.140]  This should be totally banned.
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:54.784]  Well, yeah, I don't disagree at all that these types of technologies should be banned.
[02:17:54.984 --> 02:17:56.626]  All I'm trying to indicate is that
[02:17:57.256 --> 02:18:16.091]  We should be careful in terms of what we're saying is out there and really develop because there are major theoretical genetic problems in terms of being able to use a weapon against one group without having it really backfire and... My point is that they admit that it's been worked on and studied.
[02:18:16.531 --> 02:18:19.333]  Yeah, well there's a lot of secret research that's going on.
[02:18:19.774 --> 02:18:25.338]  I think that we need to... the general problem that we're talking about here
[02:18:25.976 --> 02:18:35.220]  Really, is the fact that any sort of genetic modification is going on with these organisms because this presages a biological arms race.
[02:18:35.861 --> 02:18:39.823]  I mean, let's get into that after the break, Doctor, because that's really the crux of all this and we're honored to have you.
[02:18:40.063 --> 02:18:41.283]  But what about the chimeras?
[02:18:41.323 --> 02:18:50.628]  I mean, they've got goats that produce spider web for body armor and I have the CEO on the show and people still deny it's even going on.
[02:18:51.397 --> 02:18:57.741]  Well, you know, I mean, these are the things that need the sort of transparency and open look that you're providing on your show.
[02:18:58.922 --> 02:19:02.004]  But, I mean, how do they get to the point of spider goats in the average public?
[02:19:02.344 --> 02:19:03.785]  There's not even debate going on!
[02:19:04.306 --> 02:19:05.626]  Well, that's a problem.
[02:19:05.687 --> 02:19:10.730]  We need to be able to put pressure on our country because, unfortunately, it's been our country that has rejected
[02:19:11.371 --> 02:19:11.932]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:19:26.664 --> 02:19:31.330]  ...is where we need the strongest possible biological weapons convention.
[02:19:31.531 --> 02:19:33.073]  Much stronger than we have it now.
[02:19:33.413 --> 02:19:34.054]  Hey, let's stay there.
[02:19:34.074 --> 02:19:34.875]  We gotta break, doctor.
[02:19:34.895 --> 02:19:38.780]  We're honored to have Dr. Robert Gould, a pathologist, on the show with us.
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:42.105]  President of Physicians for Social Responsibility.
[02:19:42.405 --> 02:19:43.467]  InfoWars.com!
[02:19:45.985 --> 02:19:46.986]  It's finally here!
[02:19:47.126 --> 02:19:48.107]  Spring has arrived!
[02:19:48.307 --> 02:19:51.269]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:19:51.489 --> 02:19:54.932]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:19:55.152 --> 02:20:03.259]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[02:21:46.644 --> 02:21:48.844]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:21:49.285 --> 02:21:53.626]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:21:53.906 --> 02:21:59.707]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:21:59.947 --> 02:22:03.988]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:22:04.288 --> 02:22:09.929]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[02:22:10.049 --> 02:22:12.670]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:22:14.770 --> 02:22:18.672]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:22:18.712 --> 02:22:21.093]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:22:21.433 --> 02:22:23.714]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:22:24.115 --> 02:22:27.736]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:22:28.217 --> 02:22:34.400]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:35.840]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:36.621]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:36.641 --> 02:22:36.881]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.415 --> 02:22:52.919]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:22:53.319 --> 02:22:57.542]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:22:57.782 --> 02:23:04.827]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:23:05.208 --> 02:23:11.292]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:23:11.452 --> 02:23:12.673]  There are no side effects.
[02:23:13.013 --> 02:23:15.955]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:23:16.095 --> 02:23:18.117]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:23:18.437 --> 02:23:25.662]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:23:25.962 --> 02:23:29.345]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:23:29.785 --> 02:23:34.433]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[02:23:53.922 --> 02:24:03.338]  We're talking to Dr. Robert Gould, a pathologist in San Francisco, and he's the head of, uh, the president of San Francisco Bay Physicians for Social Responsibility.
[02:24:04.119 --> 02:24:09.341]  You know, Americans shouldn't be experts on Madonna and Michael Jackson and Britney Spears or on football.
[02:24:09.982 --> 02:24:18.545]  Spend some time on that, but you might want to find out that all over the world they have accidents at these Level 3 and Level 4 bioweapons labs and people die and horrible stuff gets released.
[02:24:18.985 --> 02:24:20.846]  And now we're going to build three dozen of these plants.
[02:24:20.866 --> 02:24:22.787]  I already set one up down in South Texas.
[02:24:23.587 --> 02:24:29.430]  UT, I guess their nuclear reactor in downtown Austin isn't enough for them that no one seems to know about that's been there for 38 years.
[02:24:30.782 --> 02:24:33.924]  You know, we have all of this happening, and people need to know about it!
[02:24:34.685 --> 02:24:44.452]  And, uh, so they're gonna have, uh, three dozen of these, thirty-plus of these, already some of them set up, along with the other labs, and, uh, we need to have a debate.
[02:24:44.492 --> 02:24:46.194]  We need to be informed about this.
[02:24:46.534 --> 02:24:49.176]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you to be informed about it.
[02:24:49.916 --> 02:24:53.959]  Uh, but, I'm sure you know how to have your belly button ring properly adorning you, though.
[02:24:53.979 --> 02:24:57.002]  Uh, but not that our whole planet could be destroyed by this.
[02:24:57.042 --> 02:24:57.342]  Doctor,
[02:24:58.522 --> 02:25:05.254]  The stuff they've developed, the stuff we know that's out there, I mean, we're talking about killing billions of people possibly, are we not?
[02:25:07.799 --> 02:25:11.646]  I mean, it depends on the organism, but again, if we're going to start
[02:25:12.259 --> 02:25:22.325]  Manufacturing new organisms that we don't have any natural resistance to in our species, the possibilities are really endless in that way.
[02:25:22.685 --> 02:25:29.509]  And this is why this research in particular needs to come under very tight international control.
[02:25:29.949 --> 02:25:39.474]  The other thing, I mean, since you have to mention the nuclear reactor issue, is another issue that we also have to think about as regards some of the programs.
[02:25:39.514 --> 02:25:40.275]  So for example,
[02:25:40.862 --> 02:25:47.593]  Some of the labs that are being slated are, for example, in my own hometown in the San Francisco Bay Area.
[02:25:48.188 --> 02:25:55.492]  There's a BSL-3 lab being proposed for being at the Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Lab.
[02:25:55.913 --> 02:26:06.959]  So already you have a sort of facility that is already operating because it's a weapons lab under a very, you know, secret type of jurisdiction.
[02:26:07.199 --> 02:26:09.121]  Also, we have double danger there!
[02:26:09.421 --> 02:26:14.484]  Well yeah, that's why many of the local community groups in our own area are the really
[02:26:15.397 --> 02:26:28.125]  Excellent work of Mary Leah Kelly and Tri-Valley Cares and parallel work with Jay Coughlin and his group at the Los Alamos labs have been very important in terms of challenging the siting of such labs.
[02:26:28.185 --> 02:26:38.011]  In fact, I refer the listeners to an excellent article called, basically, Bugs and Bombs, which talks about this particular problem.
[02:26:38.464 --> 02:26:44.106]  That was published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists last fall, I believe, the September issue.
[02:26:44.326 --> 02:26:48.688]  But, sir, doctor, you know, then we have a debate about where to put them, so they put them out in Montana.
[02:26:49.288 --> 02:26:55.890]  Bottom line, these, I mean, as I've read the evidence and you've talked about it, these are really also offensive dual-use labs.
[02:26:56.290 --> 02:26:59.932]  I mean, as the Baltimore Sun sent thousands of gallons of liquid death... Right.
[02:27:01.012 --> 02:27:06.674]  And the people in Montana, who have been opposing Mary Wolf and her group out there,
[02:27:07.341 --> 02:27:28.465]  Have been opposing, righteously, the plans to put it out in a rural area, where if there were an accident, is a place which is very underserved in terms of physicians and hospitals, so the capacity for something escaping and causing havoc there is also of concern, even though it's not a populated area.
[02:27:28.725 --> 02:27:31.006]  Spreading and not being recognized by an expert.
[02:27:31.326 --> 02:27:31.786]  Exactly.
[02:27:31.906 --> 02:27:35.847]  I mean, these are the same, you know, just last week, as came out in the press,
[02:27:37.648 --> 02:27:44.793]  Somebody working on the lab facilities in the area contracted Salmonella from actual work.
[02:27:44.813 --> 02:27:55.121]  So again, illustrating, I mean, coming down with Salmonella doesn't pose the public health threat that, say, a super virus or something else that would be developed would.
[02:27:55.221 --> 02:27:57.402]  But the point is, people do medicines.
[02:27:57.503 --> 02:28:00.665]  It indicates the problems that are inherent in this type of work.
[02:28:02.054 --> 02:28:03.155]  It's incredible, Doctor.
[02:28:03.175 --> 02:28:06.017]  You know, you talk about treaties, the UN.
[02:28:06.038 --> 02:28:15.426]  The UN is hopelessly corrupt and controlled by the same military-industrial complex, but certainly we should have treaties between countries, sanctions against countries by other countries that don't.
[02:28:16.627 --> 02:28:23.953]  But I mean, our government doesn't even follow the treaties it signs on to, but then will attack countries that refuse to sign on to treaties.
[02:28:24.213 --> 02:28:39.661]  And as well, unfortunately, in terms of the strategic policies of our own country and this administration, as opposed to doing the necessary things to control the weapons at the international level, such as having a stronger Biological Weapons Convention,
[02:28:40.140 --> 02:28:53.446]  Instead, we're going ahead with, under the policies of, quote-unquote, counter-proliferation, justifying the development of a whole new generation of nuclear weapons to supposedly take out hardened command posts and hardened facilities.
[02:28:53.546 --> 02:28:54.927]  Yeah, micro-nukes.
[02:28:55.607 --> 02:28:57.988]  Yeah, mini-nukes and bunker-busters.
[02:28:58.428 --> 02:29:07.793]  This threatens a whole new generation of nuclear weapons proliferation, supposedly, in this case, to control biological and chemical weapons, but actually
[02:29:08.937 --> 02:29:14.322]  More than, you know, this itself poses a severe threat.
[02:29:14.382 --> 02:29:27.694]  We can just see from the relatively recent revelations of the ability of the Pakistani program under Dr. Khan to basically have brochures to spread nuclear technology.
[02:29:27.735 --> 02:29:32.699]  By the way, Bush ordered the FBI not to investigate that two years ago.
[02:29:32.899 --> 02:29:33.520]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:35.862 --> 02:29:38.870]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.792 --> 02:29:42.478]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.067 --> 02:29:47.408]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[02:29:47.568 --> 02:29:51.329]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck too.
[02:29:51.509 --> 02:29:55.211]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[02:29:55.531 --> 02:29:59.152]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[02:29:59.372 --> 02:30:03.814]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[02:30:04.134 --> 02:30:07.936]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[02:30:08.176 --> 02:30:08.896]  It really works!
[02:30:09.136 --> 02:30:15.259]  NT Oil Additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[02:30:15.519 --> 02:30:16.640]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:19.481]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[02:30:19.621 --> 02:30:22.882]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps, and air tools.
[02:30:23.082 --> 02:30:28.144]  Gearboxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[02:30:28.324 --> 02:30:29.745]  Diesel engines thrive on it too.
[02:30:29.965 --> 02:30:34.047]  To place your order, call King Oil Company at 800-647-4079.

[02:30:45.959 --> 02:30:47.580]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:51.841]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:30:51.961 --> 02:30:54.842]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:30:54.922 --> 02:31:01.625]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:31:01.825 --> 02:31:04.826]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:31:05.026 --> 02:31:07.407]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:31:07.547 --> 02:31:12.269]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:31:12.449 --> 02:31:27.016]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:31:27.176 --> 02:31:33.819]  Supercharge your gravity filter today, and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96, or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[02:31:45.385 --> 02:31:46.906]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:31:47.066 --> 02:31:48.226]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:31:48.386 --> 02:31:51.808]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:31:51.908 --> 02:31:52.369]  Phenol?
[02:31:52.649 --> 02:31:59.713]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:32:00.273 --> 02:32:04.157]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:32:04.277 --> 02:32:04.717]  Fragrance?
[02:32:05.098 --> 02:32:09.862]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:32:10.002 --> 02:32:14.687]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[02:32:14.907 --> 02:32:17.450]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[02:32:17.730 --> 02:32:21.133]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:32:21.293 --> 02:32:24.777]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:32:25.017 --> 02:32:27.378]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:32:27.538 --> 02:32:28.419]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:33:24.467 --> 02:33:28.829]  Don't forget that you can link through InfoWars.com right now, The Sunshine Project.
[02:33:29.250 --> 02:33:34.593]  And we've had on their representatives, their experts many times, breaking major news report after major news report.
[02:33:34.733 --> 02:33:41.798]  I was even unaware until this morning when I saw it, that they had finally gotten the map from the feds of where they're going to put all these nasty facilities.
[02:33:41.838 --> 02:33:46.141]  And a lot of them are already up and running in existing facilities, like right here in Texas.
[02:33:46.581 --> 02:33:47.402]  It is disgusting.
[02:33:48.215 --> 02:33:50.577]  And it makes me so angry.
[02:33:51.718 --> 02:34:00.584]  Every couple of months I hear about a lab person dying, getting sick, somewhere in the western world or in Russia, in the lower level labs and in the high level labs.
[02:34:00.644 --> 02:34:05.808]  And we never hear about what happens deep in the bowels of what they would call, what do they call above level 4?
[02:34:06.128 --> 02:34:11.612]  We know there's all these giant black budget projects, and that's the majority of bioweapons activities.
[02:34:12.392 --> 02:34:20.635]  Doctor, I mean, speculating here, Dr. Robert Gould, San Francisco Bay, President of Physicians for Social Responsibility.
[02:34:21.395 --> 02:34:26.297]  I mean, from your contacts, from other pathologists, from other scientists, I mean, can you give us any inkling?
[02:34:26.317 --> 02:34:34.840]  We know tens of billions of dollars every decade is covertly spent in these labs, but I mean, can you tell us anything of the dark side of things?
[02:34:34.860 --> 02:34:39.001]  I mean, what they admit is bad enough, but can you tell us any of the other info?
[02:34:39.657 --> 02:34:53.361]  Well, I think we've laid out some of the projects that have been divulged over the last number of years, such as the ones at the Port and Downs, such as the mousepox that was synthesized in Australia.
[02:34:54.441 --> 02:35:04.544]  All that we know of is BSL-4, which is pretty high enough in terms of the dangerous work that they're entertaining doing there.
[02:35:05.316 --> 02:35:25.855]  So, you know, these technologies have not been with us for a long time, but already over the last number of years, the advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering, these, you know, presage significant capabilities for offensive arms, and that's what we're really facing right now.
[02:35:25.875 --> 02:35:29.098]  Well, I have to tell you, doctor, that I've talked to people who work for IBM and others
[02:35:30.143 --> 02:35:35.129]  And they'll just, scientists and others, they'll just laugh at you and go, there's no such thing as an unnatural mutation.
[02:35:35.229 --> 02:35:36.110]  Oh, there's no problem.
[02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:37.812]  Ah, you know, shut up.
[02:35:37.912 --> 02:35:40.214]  Because they're all making money out of it.
[02:35:40.254 --> 02:35:47.022]  That's the sort of arrogance and outright hubris that you receive from people who are not really being honest about
[02:35:47.665 --> 02:35:55.589]  What the nature of their work is, and from our standpoint, not really taking moral and ethical responsibility for whatever their work is, and for whatever they're getting paid for.
[02:35:55.609 --> 02:36:04.433]  Well, on the Kapchenko, or however you pronounce it, peninsula, I mean, they had cases where they release anthrax on accident and kill hundreds of people around in the town.
[02:36:04.473 --> 02:36:08.975]  I mean, we had Chernobyl blow up and thousands of square miles were unlivable.
[02:36:09.475 --> 02:36:10.815]  And it's that same arrogance.
[02:36:10.835 --> 02:36:11.916]  What's wrong with these people?
[02:36:12.583 --> 02:36:19.547]  Well, they're not thinking from a global standpoint of what the effects of their work is.
[02:36:19.607 --> 02:36:26.190]  I mean, we have 50 years of nuclear weapons work that already has taken an incredible toll over the
[02:36:27.057 --> 02:36:33.662]  Over 600,000 people who worked in the various atomic energy labs and Department of Energy labs.
[02:36:33.722 --> 02:36:38.806]  I mean, you can think more locally where you're at in terms of the exposures to Pantex workers.
[02:36:38.846 --> 02:36:49.514]  We have everybody from uranium miners who are exposed to digging the uranium for nuclear weapons to those who work at places like Rocky Flats where plutonium is in the ducts.
[02:36:49.534 --> 02:36:51.276]  Our government has unfortunately been
[02:36:51.940 --> 02:36:57.107]  Very cavalier with this type of weapons work since the dawn of the Cold War.
[02:36:58.128 --> 02:37:09.484]  We have millions of people around the world who are exposed to nuclear testing with effects that have been documented by the National Cancer Institute in terms of their
[02:37:10.114 --> 02:37:19.037]  effects on their thyroid, including increased incidence of thyroid cancer and that's only with one of the radioactive elements, a radioactive iodine.
[02:37:19.057 --> 02:37:23.919]  Frankly, I'm not as scared of the radioactive stuff which I am concerned about as this bio situation.
[02:37:23.939 --> 02:37:28.901]  I mean, it's not just America either, it's the rest of the world that's racing ahead at a geometric growth curve.
[02:37:30.621 --> 02:37:31.482]  Well, you know, that's the thing.
[02:37:31.982 --> 02:37:37.324]  We have to look at all of these advanced technologies and we have to fondly look at our world as
[02:37:38.177 --> 02:37:50.440]  You know, we can't construct in any one country the sort of defensive type of position that really is this absurd situation of a, you know, like a gated community.
[02:37:50.921 --> 02:37:58.683]  The fact is that, particularly when we're talking about the biological agents, they can cross boundaries, they can get in airplanes.
[02:37:58.783 --> 02:38:01.083]  I mean, we are one interconnected world.
[02:38:01.123 --> 02:38:06.945]  So to think that we could just set up a vaccination program here in the United States, even from those who would say be
[02:38:07.463 --> 02:38:34.589]  well-motivated to protect us against disease this is the larger point that we have to have the strongest possible international controls and the other thing is you know we're spending an inordinate amount of money and a lot of it again going to the biotech and pharmaceutical companies who undermine the treaty for these high-end projects which really don't touch the major problems that the world is facing I would submit that when we're thinking about real problems that are on our agenda such as impending global climate change
[02:38:35.149 --> 02:38:35.709]  Thank you.
[02:38:48.197 --> 02:39:02.585]  from the impact of climate change because many diseases that up until now have been confined to tropical areas are likely to spread as the climate change and we're probably seeing the first evidence of that for example with the West Nile virus.
[02:39:03.185 --> 02:39:12.851]  It's been predicted by the World Health Organization that by the end of the century even with the lower levels of anticipated climate change that the world burden of malaria
[02:39:13.311 --> 02:39:22.373]  We'll go from somewhere it is presently at about the 500 million people getting malaria to close to 600 million.
[02:39:22.473 --> 02:39:29.474]  They're also saying that drug immune, not just resistant, but drug immune TB is going to kill hundreds of millions.
[02:39:29.494 --> 02:39:30.355]  That's exactly right.
[02:39:30.535 --> 02:39:34.375]  One third of the world's population is infected with tuberculosis.
[02:39:34.395 --> 02:39:35.856]  That doesn't mean they have the disease.
[02:39:36.456 --> 02:39:40.437]  But particularly when our government was spending before 9-11
[02:39:42.176 --> 02:39:46.103]  Ten billion dollars a year on counter-terrorism programs.
[02:39:46.464 --> 02:39:54.598]  That same amount of money, or a little bit more, per year could, as the United Nations and the World Health Organization have indicated,
[02:39:55.163 --> 02:39:58.026]  Would be what we would need to deal with the global AIDS burden.
[02:39:58.346 --> 02:40:07.755]  And it's within that global AIDS population that tuberculosis festers and particularly antibiotic resistant tuberculosis.
[02:40:08.095 --> 02:40:20.566]  So for a fraction of the amount of money that we're dealing with high-end programs that themselves are extremely dangerous, we can do a lot more to deal with diseases that really matter and are here and threatening us right now.
[02:40:22.253 --> 02:40:24.315]  Again, the UN is hopelessly corrupt.
[02:40:24.395 --> 02:40:28.118]  It's owned and run by the same military-industrial complex that owns Big Pharma.
[02:40:28.438 --> 02:40:36.325]  Big Pharma doesn't mind if all this stuff spreads and gets bad, because then they get to treat it and make 50 times the money off of prevention and ending it.
[02:40:36.625 --> 02:40:37.626]  So it's like the drug war.
[02:40:37.646 --> 02:40:39.767]  The bigger the drug war gets, the more drugs we have on the streets.
[02:40:39.787 --> 02:40:42.409]  Well, you know, I totally understand that, and that's been the record.
[02:40:42.510 --> 02:40:49.155]  But, you know, I understand your concerns about the United Nations, but it does... I would just say that the only hope that we have
[02:40:49.719 --> 02:40:56.827]  is building strong international institutions that can actually deal with these issues as a matter of human survival.
[02:40:56.847 --> 02:40:58.369]  Let me throw this in, doctor.
[02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:59.190]  Let me throw this in.
[02:40:59.591 --> 02:41:04.837]  I started this broadcast two plus hours ago.
[02:41:05.976 --> 02:41:18.141]  Okay, saying that this is the argument of a lot of well-meaning professors and scientists and others is we've got to have this global government to stop the proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction.
[02:41:18.161 --> 02:41:22.483]  A rogue country is going to make a bioweapon that will kill tens of millions of people.
[02:41:22.964 --> 02:41:25.545]  And it's only going to be worse in 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.
[02:41:26.725 --> 02:41:29.067]  I mean, you know, this stuff is just all over the place.
[02:41:29.307 --> 02:41:32.089]  But then I look at who founded the UN, who runs it.
[02:41:32.289 --> 02:41:34.810]  The UN is too busy bed-rigging oil contracts.
[02:41:35.111 --> 02:41:41.374]  It's owned by the same just arrogant elitist that own and run this country.
[02:41:41.555 --> 02:41:47.939]  And so all I'm saying is, is that what are other models of countries, you know, working with other countries?
[02:41:48.139 --> 02:41:49.379]  You say through these treaties.
[02:41:50.180 --> 02:41:53.202]  I just don't see the UN ever doing it or the UN being a trustworthy group.
[02:41:53.702 --> 02:41:56.104]  Well, I wasn't calling for world government.
[02:41:56.164 --> 02:42:03.048]  What I was saying is that we have to recognize that these problems and these threats are global in nature.
[02:42:03.168 --> 02:42:04.229]  But that's the argument!
[02:42:04.369 --> 02:42:18.899]  And if we have problems right now with the current influences that don't allow the United Nations or other international organizations to do the job that they really need to do, then we have to think of ways to make them accountable to us and the world community.
[02:42:19.199 --> 02:42:23.182]  But we really can't deal with these things on just a national basis because
[02:42:23.792 --> 02:42:34.295]  Yeah, you know, if we're talking about infectious disease or the problem of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that are in place, things like tuberculosis, malaria, we need to have global solutions.
[02:42:34.335 --> 02:42:47.698]  So I'm not in any way, I believe, I'm not being naive about those issues, but from the standpoint of being a physician, from the standpoint of thinking about health as a global problem,
[02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:53.465]  We have to come up with creative solutions, and that's the job for us to put our heads together, to figure out ways to do that.
[02:42:53.485 --> 02:43:02.273]  Well, I think the name of the organization, Positions for Social Responsibility, means being socially responsible means you're informed, and so that's what we're trying to do here, and I appreciate you coming on.
[02:43:02.814 --> 02:43:04.055]  All I'm trying to say is this.
[02:43:04.796 --> 02:43:11.262]  You've got such arrogant people in ivory towers, whether it's the UN or Paris or London or New York,
[02:43:12.381 --> 02:43:15.442]  Such arrogant people in these ivory towers.
[02:43:15.542 --> 02:43:16.262]  I've talked to them.
[02:43:16.322 --> 02:43:17.363]  I've interviewed senators.
[02:43:18.183 --> 02:43:22.004]  They just don't get it, but they'll tell you all about the basketball scores.
[02:43:22.464 --> 02:43:24.045]  And so, you know what?
[02:43:24.145 --> 02:43:25.165]  I just see disaster.
[02:43:25.225 --> 02:43:38.909]  And I'm not trying to be negative here, but I've talked to a lot of scientists and people, and they say that there is a greater chance of a massive, deadly viral release that will kill hundreds of thousands, if not hundreds of millions, than there's a chance of us somehow coming up with a way to stop this.
[02:43:40.001 --> 02:43:48.365]  Well, I can't deny, Alex, that things are pretty grim if we're looking at the situation in the world.
[02:43:49.125 --> 02:43:50.406]  Essentially, we're pissing away.
[02:43:51.376 --> 02:44:04.727]  $400 billion on our military budget, $125 billion supplemental for Iraq and Afghanistan, when that money could be so much better used to deal with these types of threats and finding the ways to deal with it, you know, at a fraction of that.
[02:44:04.787 --> 02:44:07.730]  Well, before 9-11, they had tens of millions for terror funding.
[02:44:07.770 --> 02:44:18.739]  I remember scientists complaining, you know, you spend 2% of the anti-terror money on scientists and studies, and you spend 98% on, you know, police and black ski masks.
[02:44:19.704 --> 02:44:21.265]  This is the problem.
[02:44:23.127 --> 02:44:27.350]  I think we may disagree with what the possibilities are out there.
[02:44:27.490 --> 02:44:35.996]  I hope that I'm not coming across in any way naive about what the blocks there are to make a difference.
[02:44:36.416 --> 02:44:45.082]  But nonetheless, I think we do need to be very clear that if we're talking about global public health and environmental issues that have to get solved,
[02:44:45.549 --> 02:44:50.974]  At a global level, we have to deal with new and creative ways of dealing with this.
[02:44:50.994 --> 02:44:51.934]  Well, listen, I agree with you.
[02:44:52.015 --> 02:44:58.360]  I'm just trying to state just how bad it really is so people can, I mean, not you, but so others can get out of denial.
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:03.985]  Because I love my family, Doctor, and I see this as one of the greatest threats to our future.
[02:45:04.325 --> 02:45:08.729]  Well, you're absolutely right, and I would just say that, particularly for folks in Texas,
[02:45:10.027 --> 02:45:16.751]  There should be plenty of heat on what's going on at the University of Texas in terms of their plans for facilities like this.
[02:45:17.251 --> 02:45:21.293]  Those folks should not be allowed to conduct these operations in secret.
[02:45:21.773 --> 02:45:27.856]  It's our right to know what goes on there, not only for the whole range of issues.
[02:45:28.116 --> 02:45:38.762]  People's local health in terms of similar type of accidents that we're seeing in the case of this anthrax dissemination, as well as the larger issues of
[02:45:39.321 --> 02:45:41.631]  We as citizens of our country
[02:45:43.641 --> 02:45:49.184]  Being basically exposed to the dangers of a biological weapons race.
[02:45:49.344 --> 02:45:50.365]  Alright, Dr. Robert Gould.
[02:45:50.385 --> 02:45:52.766]  We need a full community to really be dealing with this.
[02:45:53.207 --> 02:46:00.151]  Okay, Dr. Robert Gould, San Francisco Bay, President of Physicians for Social Responsibility.
[02:46:00.491 --> 02:46:06.654]  You can go to the website of viainfowars.com, big link to the Sunshine Project.
[02:46:06.674 --> 02:46:08.315]  This is really important information.
[02:46:08.756 --> 02:46:11.157]  And, Doctor, take care and I appreciate you coming on.
[02:46:11.477 --> 02:46:12.278]  Sure, Alex.
[02:46:12.318 --> 02:46:14.820]  If I could also give our website... Oh, I didn't even know!
[02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:15.721]  Yes, sir, please!
[02:46:16.922 --> 02:46:34.597]  National Physicians for Social Responsibility, of which I was president of our national organization last year, is an organization of 30,000 health professionals, including numerous physicians as part of that, physicians and health professionals, and our website is www.psr.org.
[02:46:36.935 --> 02:46:51.921]  And we have a great deal of information on our website in terms of the global challenges facing us, not only from the various weapons of mass destruction, but also in terms of many of the issues that I was addressing today in terms of threats posed by climate change.
[02:46:52.081 --> 02:46:57.883]  Our approach is we need to have a preventive approach, not a reactive, dysfunctional approach.
[02:46:57.903 --> 02:46:59.244]  So thanks, Alex, for having me on.
[02:46:59.304 --> 02:46:59.604]  You bet.
[02:46:59.664 --> 02:47:01.084]  psr.org, doctor.
[02:47:01.645 --> 02:47:03.465]  www.psr.org.
[02:47:03.665 --> 02:47:04.786]  Okay, thanks for coming on.
[02:47:04.826 --> 02:47:05.126]  Take care.
[02:47:05.865 --> 02:47:07.465]  He was literally joining us from the lab.
[02:47:07.505 --> 02:47:09.346]  He said during the breaks he was looking in his microscope.
[02:47:10.786 --> 02:47:11.946]  That is a perfect interview.
[02:47:12.086 --> 02:47:14.967]  I could tell that guy means well, good guy, nice person.
[02:47:15.907 --> 02:47:20.068]  You know, you wouldn't, you'd feel safe letting him babysit your children, walk your dog, whatever.
[02:47:20.268 --> 02:47:21.908]  But, I started the broadcast.
[02:47:22.388 --> 02:47:28.209]  We need to post the first hour and the second hour on PrisonPlanet.tv, Paul.
[02:47:28.769 --> 02:47:32.650]  I'm telling my webmaster that, because, you know, to hear what I laid out, then to talk to him,
[02:47:34.144 --> 02:47:35.345]  You know, this is what they tell you.
[02:47:35.385 --> 02:47:37.526]  We've got to have a global government to stop this threat.
[02:47:37.646 --> 02:47:41.527]  Meanwhile, those running the global government are proliferating all this and building all this.
[02:47:42.147 --> 02:47:43.408]  So see, that's the problem.
[02:47:43.428 --> 02:47:45.909]  The psychopaths running the global government can't be trusted.
[02:47:46.529 --> 02:47:49.851]  Just like any big government can't be trusted, because bad people always get control of it.
[02:47:50.051 --> 02:47:51.691]  So global government is not the answer.
[02:47:52.512 --> 02:47:55.133]  I mean, our government leaves the border wide open, and you just heard it.
[02:47:55.193 --> 02:47:57.434]  A third of the world population has TB.
[02:47:57.894 --> 02:47:58.894]  Not the developed disease.
[02:47:59.034 --> 02:48:00.815]  Now they're saying hundreds of millions are going to die.
[02:48:01.724 --> 02:48:04.026]  This decade from it, hundreds of millions have died.
[02:48:04.666 --> 02:48:09.229]  And now they're messing with weaponizing salmonella, weaponizing TB, weaponizing everything.
[02:48:09.530 --> 02:48:11.391]  That mousepox he was talking about.
[02:48:12.932 --> 02:48:14.673]  They put out the ingredients, how to make it.
[02:48:14.793 --> 02:48:22.119]  It's very quick and easy, by the way, to take that and to make it for any mammal, and it kills 100% of the mammals that are exposed to it.
[02:48:22.639 --> 02:48:23.800]  They got stuff that kills 100%.
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:30.921]  Of whoever gets in contact with it, and there are examples every month I see.
[02:48:31.121 --> 02:48:38.883]  Mainstream news, back of the paper, where somebody gets sick from a bioweapon or one of the precursors at one of these bioweapons labs.
[02:48:39.103 --> 02:48:41.424]  And let me tell you, this stuff's going on right here in Austin.
[02:48:41.584 --> 02:48:43.964]  They built a disgusting center down on the coast.
[02:48:44.604 --> 02:48:46.585]  They have got a nuclear reactor in Austin.
[02:48:46.805 --> 02:48:51.566]  And let me tell you, all these Austinites know which dorm room, you know, the quarterback lives in.
[02:48:52.562 --> 02:48:58.787]  And what beer he likes to drink, but you people in Austin do not know there's a nuclear reactor in this town!
[02:49:00.629 --> 02:49:02.490]  And it's the same for the whole country!
[02:49:09.116 --> 02:49:10.557]  This is so dangerous.
[02:49:11.658 --> 02:49:13.700]  And they've got psychopaths running this.
[02:49:15.021 --> 02:49:15.601]  And the U.N.
[02:49:15.641 --> 02:49:18.964]  involving all their population control and dosing the vaccines with poison.
[02:49:20.603 --> 02:49:22.384]  Cancer and sterilization systems.
[02:49:22.584 --> 02:49:23.305]  It's all admitted.
[02:49:23.325 --> 02:49:25.847]  We have a huge archive on PrisonPlanet.com covering it.
[02:49:26.547 --> 02:49:31.110]  I'm going to come back and continue to talk about this, because I've got a rant that I want to continue on this subject.
[02:49:31.671 --> 02:49:34.673]  I might jam a few calls in in the final segment, I don't know.
[02:49:35.994 --> 02:49:39.756]  I just hope you all get Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State, Three Total Enslavement.
[02:49:40.056 --> 02:49:41.357]  I hope you get all my films.
[02:49:42.198 --> 02:49:46.641]  And I hope you jam them in a VCR, get a second VCR, make a hundred copies of it in the next hundred days.
[02:49:46.901 --> 02:49:48.142]  A copy every night when you go to bed.
[02:49:48.928 --> 02:49:52.470]  Help you give it to people in your area and put it on AXS TV and warn everyone.
[02:49:52.871 --> 02:49:56.133]  Because it's all I do is study this and let me tell you it is serious business.
[02:49:57.454 --> 02:50:01.156]  And they sold the entire intelligentsia on world government because of this threat.
[02:50:01.376 --> 02:50:05.759]  What the intelligentsia doesn't get is that their bosses are the ones that are going to release it!
[02:50:10.142 --> 02:50:10.662]  Oh man!
[02:50:10.682 --> 02:50:16.666]  And you know I hope by getting these experts up and you hear me in these dialogues with them that we're giving you accurate information.
[02:50:16.986 --> 02:50:18.207]  I've actually studied all this.
[02:50:19.455 --> 02:50:19.916]  In-depth!
[02:50:20.556 --> 02:50:21.217]  Continually!
[02:50:21.257 --> 02:50:21.857]  Perpetually!
[02:50:22.638 --> 02:50:25.881]  Don't forget to sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv, my friends.
[02:50:25.901 --> 02:50:27.182]  15 cents a day.
[02:50:27.202 --> 02:50:27.962]  We need your support.
[02:50:28.403 --> 02:50:29.904]  It funds all the other websites.
[02:50:29.944 --> 02:50:30.785]  Incredible bandwidth.
[02:50:31.806 --> 02:50:33.487]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:34.067 --> 02:50:36.309]  Video reports, audio reports, text reports.
[02:50:36.349 --> 02:50:36.950]  It's all there.
[02:50:37.390 --> 02:50:38.771]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:39.892 --> 02:50:41.894]  Alright, we'll be right back with the final segment.
[02:50:41.914 --> 02:50:42.695]  Stay the course.
[02:50:45.715 --> 02:50:50.060]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:54.685]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:54.805 --> 02:50:59.210]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:50:59.250 --> 02:51:00.592]  The New World Order.
[02:51:02.374 --> 02:51:06.598]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:06.658 --> 02:51:13.586]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:13.726 --> 02:51:15.729]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.109 --> 02:51:26.516]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:26.716 --> 02:51:32.079]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:51:32.599 --> 02:51:36.102]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:51:36.522 --> 02:51:37.643]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:51:45.402 --> 02:51:50.604]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:51:50.764 --> 02:51:58.846]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:51:59.106 --> 02:52:06.148]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:52:07.108 --> 02:52:13.592]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:52:13.792 --> 02:52:18.875]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:52:18.995 --> 02:52:27.861]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:52:28.141 --> 02:52:31.423]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:53:46.252 --> 02:53:51.757]  Alright my friends, final segment here on this Friday edition.
[02:54:14.045 --> 02:54:26.232]  Again, if you are a little bit more informed, I don't mean our general listeners, but those out there that think football or topless bars are God, or how to apply your cosmetics is the most important thing of the day.
[02:54:27.773 --> 02:54:34.297]  The real world is exciting, dynamic, terrifying, invigorating when you fight back against the corruption.
[02:54:37.094 --> 02:54:54.106]  And you need to be able to face the true nature of evil and the eugenics-minded, Nazi-minded, corrupt-minded people running the globe who would openly send our troops into bases, bombed by depleted uranium, to breathe it, their blood filled with it, admit it, and then nothing's done.
[02:54:54.126 --> 02:54:55.167]  No one gets in trouble.
[02:54:55.207 --> 02:54:56.868]  They come out and admit they're torturing people.
[02:54:57.268 --> 02:54:58.449]  These people don't get in trouble.
[02:54:59.511 --> 02:55:00.552]  Those giving the orders.
[02:55:01.252 --> 02:55:02.913]  It's the exercise of evil.
[02:55:03.273 --> 02:55:05.194]  The priest of raw power.
[02:55:05.734 --> 02:55:06.715]  Always more power.
[02:55:06.855 --> 02:55:07.815]  Always more abuse.
[02:55:07.975 --> 02:55:10.797]  Always, you know, as they said in 1984.
[02:55:12.398 --> 02:55:15.699]  And this is the system that we're now facing here together.
[02:55:18.861 --> 02:55:20.081]  And so I'm begging you.
[02:55:21.062 --> 02:55:23.023]  I'm pleading with you to make
[02:55:23.872 --> 02:55:30.775]  A large part of the focus in your life on being informed, truly informed, on issues that actually affect you and your family.
[02:55:31.455 --> 02:55:36.657]  The open borders, NAFTA, GAP, biological weapons, genetic engineering.
[02:55:36.697 --> 02:55:43.059]  You know, here I am talking with this top scientist, head of a major hospital, by the way, I didn't get into that.
[02:55:43.079 --> 02:55:46.661]  You know, oh, the half spider goats, oh yes, you know, it's a big problem.
[02:55:48.392 --> 02:55:51.033]  They've now legalized chimeras in humans.
[02:55:51.553 --> 02:55:53.273]  Part human, part animal in Europe.
[02:55:53.333 --> 02:55:55.734]  I mean, this is just happening, racing ahead.
[02:55:55.754 --> 02:55:57.254]  That's the public stuff?
[02:55:58.034 --> 02:56:01.315]  Pharmacological crops with live HIV virus in the corn?
[02:56:01.335 --> 02:56:03.876]  Forgot to bring that up with the doctor.
[02:56:06.296 --> 02:56:09.657]  This is the reality, folks, and it's going on.
[02:56:09.897 --> 02:56:12.738]  But you tell your neighbor about it, they will laugh at you.
[02:56:15.158 --> 02:56:16.139]  They will laugh at you.
[02:56:16.179 --> 02:56:17.559]  People can't even figure out that
[02:56:18.177 --> 02:56:23.341]  You know, the government grew under Ronald Reagan, and that we lost liberties, and that Bush is going to sign the Assault Weapons Ban.
[02:56:23.481 --> 02:56:25.462]  And I'm not here bashing Ronald Reagan!
[02:56:26.163 --> 02:56:30.105]  But, you know, don't let the facts get in the way of your opinion, huh?
[02:56:30.826 --> 02:56:32.107]  You better get the facts!
[02:56:33.808 --> 02:56:37.691]  You better learn that Bush isn't conservative, and the Republicans are selling us out.
[02:56:37.871 --> 02:56:39.032]  And so will the Democrats.
[02:56:39.052 --> 02:56:40.833]  You go, well, that's bad news.
[02:56:41.073 --> 02:56:46.197]  Well, you better face the bad news, and get about the job of turning this thing around.
[02:56:50.535 --> 02:56:55.578]  I mean, I'm sorry, raping and killing women and children at Abu Ghraib is not acceptable.
[02:56:56.238 --> 02:56:59.980]  You can make your excuses about torture, you know, to save the troops, and then look what it leads to.
[02:57:00.641 --> 02:57:04.843]  In every case, stopping families at checkpoints, and then taking them for torture.
[02:57:04.863 --> 02:57:06.424]  Because their papers weren't in order.
[02:57:06.604 --> 02:57:08.025]  That's not what America's about!
[02:57:08.285 --> 02:57:10.627]  And those troops are coming back here to be your police!
[02:57:13.888 --> 02:57:14.689]  We have the power.
[02:57:15.228 --> 02:57:16.909]  The American people, the people of the world do.
[02:57:17.229 --> 02:57:18.030]  We have to move.
[02:57:18.070 --> 02:57:19.090]  We have to take action.
[02:57:19.130 --> 02:57:20.171]  We have to be informed.
[02:57:20.431 --> 02:57:22.192]  We have to stop being lazy and ignorant.
[02:57:23.492 --> 02:57:26.954]  And again, a big part of this solution, I'll just plug it one more time, is my videos.
[02:57:27.315 --> 02:57:28.135]  I've made ten of them.
[02:57:28.155 --> 02:57:28.875]  I've published a book.
[02:57:28.915 --> 02:57:29.556]  I've written a book.
[02:57:29.796 --> 02:57:31.437]  I carry a bunch of other great books and videos.
[02:57:31.837 --> 02:57:37.440]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via Artists Aid Secure Shopping Cart.
[02:57:39.021 --> 02:57:39.341]  Get them.
[02:57:39.741 --> 02:57:40.582]  Make copies of them.
[02:57:40.602 --> 02:57:41.102]  My videos.
[02:57:41.122 --> 02:57:42.923]  You can't have the other people's because I can't authorize that.
[02:57:43.542 --> 02:57:45.743]  Total free number to order the films, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:57:45.823 --> 02:57:46.384]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:57:46.624 --> 02:57:49.505]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.
[02:57:49.565 --> 02:57:49.745]  That's 3001.
[02:57:49.785 --> 02:57:52.967]  South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:57:53.007 --> 02:57:56.229]  And if we get more support, we can do more, make better films, reach more people.
