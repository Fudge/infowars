[00:00:05.703 --> 00:00:06.323]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:08.044]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.765 --> 00:00:09.866]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.526 --> 00:00:11.346]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:13.007]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:17.350]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.933]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.212]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 15th day of September 2004.
[00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:38.854]  On this live Wednesday edition, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:38.874 --> 00:00:50.358]  We have a surprise guest joining us in the second hour, and then in the third hour, General Benton K. Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development, will be on with us.
[00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.159]  Talk about the first guest.
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.981]  Ivan could submerge New Orleans.
[00:00:58.442 --> 00:01:01.944]  The Houston Chronicle is reporting 50,000 could drown.
[00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:05.827]  New Orleans could cease to exist.
[00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:08.428]  Those are quotes out of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:21.296]  More than 1.2 million people in metropolitan New Orleans were warned to get out yesterday as a 140 mile an hour hurricane, Ivan the Terrible, turned towards the Gulf Coast, threatened to submerge
[00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:28.758]  The below sea level city during what could be the most disastrous storm to hit in nearly 40 years.
[00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:32.900]  Paul Watson put this nice little comment at the top of it.
[00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:41.624]  Says, this is an interesting primer for future government scaremongering tactics where people are told that asteroids are going to strike.
[00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:54.195]  The fact that we're in 2004 and New Orleans flood defenses haven't been significantly bolstered to handle this sort of disaster makes even George Bush look confident in comparison.
[00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:56.417]  Inserting 9-11.
[00:01:56.797 --> 00:01:58.179]  And I agree, I mean
[00:01:59.847 --> 00:02:01.448]  New Orleans is below sea level.
[00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:07.072]  They know that anytime there's any large-scale rains, they flood.
[00:02:07.653 --> 00:02:13.257]  And here is this hurricane going 140 miles an hour, about to start.
[00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:19.862]  Big Brother.
[00:02:20.522 --> 00:02:21.503]  Mainstream Media.
[00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.360]  Government cover-ups.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.920]  You want answers?
[00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:26.521]  Well, so does he.
[00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:30.823]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:02:31.363 --> 00:02:35.485]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:49.092]  Alright, this Dr. Thomas Barnett is this Naval War College strategist, and he openly says that the military works for the big corporations, it's part of a global government,
[00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:51.072]  They're going to take over the planet.
[00:02:51.172 --> 00:02:52.755]  Russia and China are big buddies.
[00:02:52.796 --> 00:02:57.066]  He chastised the Pentagon for not wanting to work with communist China.
[00:02:57.086 --> 00:02:57.988]  They're not communists.
[00:02:58.008 --> 00:02:59.150]  They're wonderful, basically.
[00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:02.697]  And, again, this happens.
[00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:05.360]  Michelle Malkin writes a book, Independent Internment Camps.
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.801]  Finds out who I am.
[00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:07.482]  Won't come on.
[00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:08.643]  Won't defend their ideas.
[00:03:09.344 --> 00:03:10.945]  It's the same thing with Mr. Barnett.
[00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:12.126]  We set it up days ago.
[00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:12.987]  Confirmed today.
[00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:14.769]  He went and looked up who we are.
[00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.952]  And told Scott, running the show, no.
[00:03:18.913 --> 00:03:19.954]  What was the quote, Scott?
[00:03:20.414 --> 00:03:21.876]  Why don't we bring Scott up here.
[00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:22.576]  Scott, real quick.
[00:03:23.137 --> 00:03:24.959]  Did he say the site is too abhorrent?
[00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.003]  Yeah, he said he found things abhorrent on the website and didn't want to do it.
[00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:32.687]  He found things abhorrent and then you said, well, just please come on for a few minutes and what did he do?
[00:03:33.348 --> 00:03:34.128]  Uh, he just said no.
[00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.991]  So, he pretty much refused to come on with you today.
[00:03:37.132 --> 00:03:38.313]  And you said he hung up on you?
[00:03:38.513 --> 00:03:42.938]  Yeah, he, well, he wasn't rudely, but he said, I'm not going to come on and hung up.
[00:03:43.438 --> 00:03:45.901]  Yeah, so, this is the guy.
[00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:57.630]  Okay, and he talks about Wall Street just loves me, and the Wall Street people understand this new rule set, and you know, we're going to have this global army, and it was open new world order.
[00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.392]  So we'll just talk about Mr. Barnett now.
[00:04:00.652 --> 00:04:07.355]  For those of you that saw him on C-SPAN, it's aired several times, and for those that witnessed this, we even got a tape of it.
[00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:10.236]  It's not been loaded into the computer, so we can't play it.
[00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:10.896]  I should have done that.
[00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:12.437]  I wanted to have you hear from him.
[00:04:12.537 --> 00:04:14.038]  They will not defend their ideas.
[00:04:14.983 --> 00:04:16.384]  It's got to be in a controlled area.
[00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:21.610]  General Parton is going to be coming on to talk about these ideas and what he thinks of it.
[00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.293]  He warned of this new map, this model, decades ago.
[00:04:25.994 --> 00:04:27.015]  And he's a real expert.
[00:04:28.216 --> 00:04:32.581]  And so we'll see, instead of getting General Parton on in the third hour, we'll see if we can get him on a little bit earlier.
[00:04:32.841 --> 00:04:36.865]  I know he was studying up on Mr. Barnett earlier this morning.
[00:04:37.717 --> 00:04:39.458]  But he's aware of this whole move in the Pentagon.
[00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:46.703]  So we'll get General Benton K. Parton on the show and go over Mr. Barnett.
[00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:48.664]  But just amazing.
[00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.147]  Have you gotten a hold of Parton, Scott?
[00:04:54.188 --> 00:04:54.888]  Good.
[00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.010]  Tell him I want to talk to him during the break.
[00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.491]  Just try to keep him there a few minutes and I want to come back and talk to him.
[00:05:00.112 --> 00:05:01.953]  I mean, all we want are these globalists.
[00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:03.314]  And that's what the guy said.
[00:05:03.374 --> 00:05:04.675]  It's part of globalism.
[00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.100]  We have these spreadsheets of globalism taking over the planet.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.361]  It was frightening stuff.
[00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:11.422]  What we'll do is we'll have listeners who saw this.
[00:05:11.442 --> 00:05:12.522]  I know a lot of you have called in about it.
[00:05:12.822 --> 00:05:13.543]  I saw it too.
[00:05:14.643 --> 00:05:15.844]  Call in and discuss this.
[00:05:16.484 --> 00:05:18.405]  The end of posse comitatus, all of it.
[00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:29.790]  And we'll go over it with General Benton K. Parton, who's been warning of this exact rule change, as they call it, with
[00:05:31.488 --> 00:05:37.433]  With the Pentagon and how he and himself and many others have been warning people within the Pentagon.
[00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:43.017]  But it's just outrageous that globalists will not come on and defend their ideas.
[00:05:43.037 --> 00:05:47.601]  They're all happy to do radio interviews until they find out that we're aware of the New World Order.
[00:05:48.262 --> 00:05:58.190]  That we're aware of this merger between our military, our government, with the Soviet Russians, which is still what they are, putting the Red Stars back on their vehicles.
[00:05:58.855 --> 00:06:07.101]  When they find out that we're against the merger with Communist China, when they find out that we're not for this New World Order model, they run!
[00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:11.724]  They don't jog away from us, they run away from us.
[00:06:12.904 --> 00:06:28.395]  So we were going to talk about the Pentagon's new map, the book, A Future Worth Creating, and you can read the pre-introduction storyboard, the director's commentary, you can go over
[00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:55.027]  the entire system they're building on his website thomas p m barnett dot com you can go look at what i witnessed on c-span and uh... wall street he admits is right behind him and loves his idea and he says the pentagon works for wall street works for the big banks it's just it's just everything we've already known right out the open but he chastised the pentagon when i was watching this on c-span
[00:06:55.968 --> 00:07:00.313]  Auditorium full of brass saying, you need to know that China's our friend and they're going to aid us.
[00:07:00.874 --> 00:07:02.476]  Now Russia's merging with NATO.
[00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:04.097]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:07:17.245 --> 00:07:22.730]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.394]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:34.661]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:41.147]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:41.287 --> 00:07:42.508]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:42.828 --> 00:07:45.792]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:45.952 --> 00:07:47.974]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:55.523]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:07:55.824 --> 00:07:59.208]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:07:59.608 --> 00:08:02.710]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:02.770]  866-885-6625.
[00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.870]  866-885-6625.
[00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.050]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.270]  Call today.
[00:08:15.493 --> 00:08:24.560]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:36.048]  Black quirky elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:42.093]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:48.978]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:08:49.198 --> 00:08:56.003]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:08:56.283 --> 00:08:58.064]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.386]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:02.307]  Get a 2-pack for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175.
[00:09:02.507 --> 00:09:03.188]  Call New Millennium at 888-
[00:09:11.874 --> 00:09:18.078]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:22.681]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:09:22.821 --> 00:09:27.204]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:09:27.244 --> 00:09:28.605]  The New World Order.
[00:09:29.365 --> 00:09:30.286]  Panama.
[00:09:30.366 --> 00:09:34.588]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:09:34.648 --> 00:09:41.591]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:09:41.711 --> 00:09:43.792]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:09:44.072 --> 00:09:54.497]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:09:54.718 --> 00:09:55.538]  If you want to understand
[00:09:55.558 --> 00:09:58.679]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:10:28.428 --> 00:10:39.036]  Okay, I was going to have this Pentagon strategist, uh, war thinker, guru on the show, Thomas P.M.
[00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:56.288]  Barnett, and then he said, I'm not coming on to the folks running the show, so I called him during the break, and he began cussing at me right off the bat, uh, telling me, you know, well I hope you sleep good at night, uh, you know, saying the CIA could have been behind Nick Berg.
[00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:57.809]  That's been mainstream news, by the way.
[00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:02.016]  Uh, yelling at me about saying the government had prior knowledge of 9-11.
[00:11:02.256 --> 00:11:05.038]  Well, half of New Yorkers think that, so I guess they're evil too.
[00:11:05.078 --> 00:11:06.459]  I bet they sleep at night good.
[00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:09.121]  Actually, they probably don't, thinking there's about to be another attack.
[00:11:10.241 --> 00:11:13.284]  And I'm sitting there, and this guy is just vicious!
[00:11:14.204 --> 00:11:15.905]  And I said, what about PNAC documents?
[00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.106]  What about Operation Northwood?
[00:11:17.126 --> 00:11:19.608]  And he just wouldn't talk, started going, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[00:11:20.148 --> 00:11:21.269]  I mean, it was amazing.
[00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:22.910]  And I said, come on and defend your ideas.
[00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.333]  And he said, he said, I wouldn't dignify a show like yours.
[00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:33.274]  And so, we're going to research this guy even more, and we're going to expose some of the stuff that's going on.
[00:11:33.294 --> 00:11:41.460]  I mean, I watched this guy on C-SPAN last weekend, or actually a couple weekends ago, right when I got back from New York City.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:53.829]  And he had these models of globalization, and China's our friend, and Russia's our friend, and we're going to merge together and fight the evil terrorist, and here's the new map, and we're going to go into Africa and the Middle East and take it over, and
[00:11:55.051 --> 00:12:07.427]  You know, all of this, and we work for the big corporations, the Pentagon works for the big corporations, that's who we work for, and Wall Street just loves me, and just so arrogant and pompous.
[00:12:07.847 --> 00:12:09.029]  I know a lot of you saw that.
[00:12:09.569 --> 00:12:13.114]  It's hard to believe unless you witnessed it for yourself.
[00:12:14.156 --> 00:12:30.149]  But General Parton, it was going to come on in the third hour, now he says he'll come on at the bottom of this hour, a little bit early, because I wanted him to come on after Mr. Barnett, because everything General Parton has talked about, and what the Pentagon was going to shift into, and what was going to happen, is now happening.
[00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.831]  He wrote about this decades ago.
[00:12:33.832 --> 00:12:43.060]  Decades ago, and of course he's a brigadier general, former head of Air Force Weapons Development, a veteran of multiple wars, and just a great patriot.
[00:12:44.674 --> 00:12:58.436]  And now we hear about Russia openly going to merge with NATO, NATO now with a global role, Russia saying it will have preemptive strikes around the planet, all of this, and I got a stack of mainstream articles about Russian intelligence involvement in the attacks on the school.
[00:13:00.017 --> 00:13:07.218]  We know the Russian government carried out the bombings in 1999 to get Putin into office as FSB was caught planting bombs in the fourth building.
[00:13:07.478 --> 00:13:09.418]  I mean, all we're doing is covering the facts.
[00:13:10.118 --> 00:13:13.119]  And there's people that are really upset out there about this.
[00:13:13.977 --> 00:13:16.678]  But this Barnett guy had been on my website.
[00:13:16.718 --> 00:13:20.560]  He was describing a bunch of stuff off of it and was very upset.
[00:13:21.861 --> 00:13:22.261]  Livid.
[00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:25.822]  And just amazing.
[00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.604]  But we're not going to stop, folks.
[00:13:30.404 --> 00:13:33.366]  He finally just started screaming when I said, we're going to win.
[00:13:33.406 --> 00:13:34.246]  The truth will come out.
[00:13:34.566 --> 00:13:35.267]  We're going to win.
[00:13:35.287 --> 00:13:36.447]  We're going to prevail.
[00:13:36.507 --> 00:13:37.428]  We're the real Patriots.
[00:13:37.468 --> 00:13:40.469]  And he just started screaming and hung up the telephone.
[00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:44.393]  So, I don't know what to say about it.
[00:13:45.574 --> 00:13:46.896]  Just incredible.
[00:13:49.178 --> 00:13:50.659]  It was actually kind of scary.
[00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:53.842]  I mean, I was being pretty nice to him until the end, and I just said, well, we're going to win, sir.
[00:13:54.543 --> 00:13:55.143]  We're going to win.
[00:13:55.163 --> 00:13:56.204]  We're going to defend this country.
[00:14:00.929 --> 00:14:05.713]  I'm crazy, because I think the government had prior knowledge and was involved, and I started trying to go, well, what about the official government plans?
[00:14:05.793 --> 00:14:06.314]  Northwoods?
[00:14:06.354 --> 00:14:06.674]  PNAC?
[00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:14.357]  And he just, but within 10 seconds of talking to him, he goes, listen, I think what you do is beep, beep, beep.
[00:14:15.057 --> 00:14:16.657]  And I think blah, blah, blah.
[00:14:16.677 --> 00:14:17.857]  I mean, he's just so angry.
[00:14:19.378 --> 00:14:20.638]  So we're in a fight, folks.
[00:14:20.718 --> 00:14:24.839]  I mean, I couldn't believe what I was watching this guy teach all these military brats.
[00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:28.600]  I mean, it was the whole New World Order plan just right out in the open.
[00:14:30.114 --> 00:14:31.975]  I hope none of you spend money on his book.
[00:14:32.055 --> 00:14:35.496]  I hope none of you will support this guy, but we do have to analyze him.
[00:14:35.516 --> 00:14:41.318]  But he's all part of this entire neocon gaggle that is up there in the Pentagon now.
[00:14:42.498 --> 00:14:44.339]  Very, very serious situation.
[00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:53.062]  But it must feel good, you know, just to be part of the establishment and to serve it and to, you know, think you've got everything set and you're on the winning side.
[00:14:53.402 --> 00:14:57.243]  Although the American people are going to win and the New World Order will be defeated.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.942]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gil in Texas.
[00:15:01.042 --> 00:15:01.803]  Gil, go ahead.
[00:15:02.223 --> 00:15:02.503]  Yes.
[00:15:02.743 --> 00:15:11.650]  Do you think there's a real possibility that the gentleman you had scheduled, maybe his handlers got to him and said, look, I'll make an offer you can't refuse.
[00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.073]  You go on that show and we'll demote you, or even worse, probably take him out.
[00:15:16.814 --> 00:15:17.414]  I don't know that.
[00:15:17.474 --> 00:15:18.235]  No, I don't think so.
[00:15:18.275 --> 00:15:21.457]  They don't do that with their energetic, happy servants.
[00:15:22.238 --> 00:15:25.380]  The guy went on my website right before he was about to go on air with us.
[00:15:26.267 --> 00:15:31.936]  And I'm sure, we didn't have his name listed, we said General Benton K. Parton will come on to talk about the Pentagon's new map.
[00:15:32.597 --> 00:15:35.922]  And so I think maybe he thought Parton was coming on while he was going to be on.
[00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:37.525]  That wasn't my intention.
[00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:45.635]  I was going to have Parton maybe go on the line a little bit early at the end of the interview to hear what the guy said and maybe bring him up, but not in the first part of the interview.
[00:15:45.995 --> 00:15:50.678]  The scheduling was for the third hour when Mr. Barnett would be gone, but I don't know.
[00:15:51.358 --> 00:15:52.999]  Did you see that guy on C-SPAN?
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.701]  No, I haven't had the pleasure of doing that.
[00:15:55.721 --> 00:16:00.064]  I do listen to your show and I have a copy of 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:16:00.764 --> 00:16:06.007]  I'm in the southeast Texas area, a heavy industrial oil area.
[00:16:07.441 --> 00:16:09.362]  One of the slogans where we oil the world.
[00:16:09.382 --> 00:16:11.143]  I have a question for you.
[00:16:11.263 --> 00:16:13.124]  Lately, they have been harassed.
[00:16:13.144 --> 00:16:15.025]  There was a ship that was ran into.
[00:16:15.045 --> 00:16:16.785]  The Coast Guard had to come out.
[00:16:16.845 --> 00:16:19.427]  And in a rash, they've been closing down highways.
[00:16:20.207 --> 00:16:27.050]  And it seems like every week or every other week, there's some kind of incident where they have to shut the roads down.
[00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.752]  Do you think it's possible that the industrial complex has gotten with the
[00:16:31.465 --> 00:16:35.527]  The military and the police department, and this is a good way for them to start testing.
[00:16:36.267 --> 00:16:41.569]  I know that they have done thousands and thousands of drills all over the country.
[00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:45.890]  A lot of times they don't even tell us their drills until later when we force them to.
[00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:48.852]  Fake nuclear spills, all types of stuff.
[00:16:48.892 --> 00:16:53.973]  And yes, they're testing the martial law systems, preparing and getting everybody ready for it.
[00:16:54.314 --> 00:16:59.976]  Because every other week around here, every two or three weeks around here, there's some kind of road closure here in my area.
[00:17:01.275 --> 00:17:08.167]  Or there's a chemical spill, or there's been a ship that's been ran into and they have to close down the waterways because they have to clean up the spill.
[00:17:08.863 --> 00:17:12.244]  Well, I mean a lot of that's always happening down by Houston.
[00:17:12.424 --> 00:17:16.245]  I mean, a lot of that's probably real, but have they had drills down there?
[00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:17.525]  Yes, they have had admitted drills.
[00:17:17.865 --> 00:17:22.646]  So it's kind of a gray area as to where this is staged or whether this is actually happening.
[00:17:22.906 --> 00:17:26.327]  Maybe they are actually, is it possible they actually do these things?
[00:17:27.407 --> 00:17:29.807]  You mentioned problem, reaction, solution.
[00:17:29.927 --> 00:17:33.008]  Is it possible to kind of test the system?
[00:17:33.048 --> 00:17:35.629]  Let's say, well, okay, let's have some kind of mock thing happen.
[00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.329]  Let's actually do something.
[00:17:39.849 --> 00:17:40.350]  I don't know.
[00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.632]  I don't want to speculate on that.
[00:17:41.732 --> 00:17:47.683]  I mean, the Houston Chronicle has said Houston's a big target of Al-Siada and CIArabs.
[00:17:49.588 --> 00:17:58.354]  But would the chemical industry and the military industrial complex go that far as to kind of shoot their own self in the foot to test their military system?
[00:17:58.434 --> 00:18:05.098]  Well, by announcing all the time that the refineries are breaking down and out of date and there's not enough oil, they're able to jack up the prices.
[00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:05.799]  Thanks for the call.
[00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:08.501]  So we know that's going on, Gil.
[00:18:08.541 --> 00:18:09.361]  Interesting questions.
[00:18:10.042 --> 00:18:13.084]  Let's talk to Bob calling from the USA.
[00:18:13.484 --> 00:18:14.325]  Bob, you're on the air.
[00:18:14.365 --> 00:18:14.785]  Go ahead.
[00:18:15.605 --> 00:18:16.766]  Long time listener.
[00:18:17.106 --> 00:18:19.228]  Always tell folks to
[00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:32.614]  They don't call it Divide and Conquer for nothing, so Mexican folks, black folks, Jewish folks, everybody in neighborhoods need to be good friends with everybody in case something's happening.
[00:18:33.014 --> 00:18:42.357]  We got water, everybody's got gardens, we've got emergency plans, and I want to see commercials where we see troops
[00:18:43.297 --> 00:19:08.520]  running towards something they're saying someone's yelling all right let's get these libraries built let's get these schools open let's get these gardens made all right let's get this water purified for people let's get everybody burn your water filters let's go doing stuff like that instead of always destroying and one of the secrets the so-called secrets of the esoteric secret societies is that
[00:19:09.642 --> 00:19:14.565]  They must become this thing most evil so that this great good will be realized.
[00:19:15.166 --> 00:19:26.894]  And through creating the most restrictive Orwellian society, microchips everything, that the human revolution against that will usher in this golden age.
[00:19:27.795 --> 00:19:31.837]  And I say, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[00:19:31.857 --> 00:19:33.739]  Or, don't skin cats.
[00:19:34.443 --> 00:19:36.844]  What are you doing skin and caps for?
[00:19:37.284 --> 00:19:38.684]  Alright, but thanks for the call.
[00:19:38.784 --> 00:19:39.885]  Look, let me just say this.
[00:19:41.745 --> 00:19:42.126]  Okay?
[00:19:43.566 --> 00:19:49.608]  The globalists at the top rationalize the tyranny they're setting up global government like this.
[00:19:49.628 --> 00:19:51.429]  And it's in their own publications.
[00:19:51.829 --> 00:19:52.289]  It's public.
[00:19:53.169 --> 00:19:57.091]  They say there's a threat of level four bioweapons.
[00:19:57.151 --> 00:19:58.991]  There's a threat of nuclear proliferation.
[00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:03.933]  If we don't have a global government, countries will independently develop these and destroy the planet.
[00:20:05.402 --> 00:20:08.124]  We've got to be more evil than the most evil to defeat them.
[00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:11.547]  The truth must be guarded by a bodyguard of lies.
[00:20:12.027 --> 00:20:13.288]  You know, all of these statements.
[00:20:13.949 --> 00:20:19.794]  And that's how they fool well-meaning, idealistic people into serving this system.
[00:20:20.234 --> 00:20:22.236]  I mean, a lot of these are well-meaning, good folks.
[00:20:23.777 --> 00:20:24.818]  They think they're doing good.
[00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:26.819]  I mean, that's probably what Mr. Barnett is.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.963]  Okay, well, you know, with the Pentagon's new global government map, I mean, that's what it is.
[00:20:32.697 --> 00:20:33.858]  And so that's their excuse.
[00:20:33.918 --> 00:20:42.146]  But meanwhile, we catch the globalists funding and training the terrorists, proliferating the weapons, really creating crises.
[00:20:42.166 --> 00:20:44.728]  And that's their maxim, is order out of chaos.
[00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:51.134]  And yes, at the very highest levels of this whole skull and bones, esoteric, occult, mumbo-jumbo,
[00:20:51.852 --> 00:21:00.255]  That's their excuse, is we've got to bring in total evil to have the balance in the force, you know, kind of like the George Lucas line, between the dark side and the light.
[00:21:00.275 --> 00:21:07.917]  And by bringing in this great evil, then, you know, it will create this great movement of goodness against it, and then we'll finally have the Golden Age!
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.782]  And it's very, very dangerous and it's a rationalization.
[00:21:12.282 --> 00:21:21.947]  Really what they operate under is social Darwin views, or social Darwinist views, of we're the best, we're the smartest, that's why we're in control, it's our right to rule over these dumb people.
[00:21:22.287 --> 00:21:29.331]  And then they do everything they can to further dumb us down and go, oh look, see they're dumb, we've got to take care of them, we've got to be the social engineers.
[00:21:30.407 --> 00:21:33.028]  And so that's really what they're doing.
[00:21:33.609 --> 00:21:37.031]  All right, we'll come back and get to a bunch of other callers.
[00:21:37.051 --> 00:21:51.238]  Then we have General Benton K. Harden joining us to talk about his warnings of how they would try to shift the Pentagon into serving and working with what I call the Neo-Soviets in Russia and the commies in China.
[00:21:53.019 --> 00:21:58.842]  We've had the professors call in from China on the show where they're listening, trying to convince us how good China is.
[00:22:00.296 --> 00:22:01.257]  We're not going to buy that.
[00:22:01.357 --> 00:22:06.121]  China is the New World Order model because of the tyranny there and the dehumanization.
[00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:12.166]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.com of course is a little bit different than PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:22:12.366 --> 00:22:12.767]  We'll be back.
[00:22:15.077 --> 00:22:17.959]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.202]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:22:21.422 --> 00:22:27.627]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:23:14.673 --> 00:23:17.054]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:23:17.314 --> 00:23:21.136]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:23:21.456 --> 00:23:22.256]  Read the labels.
[00:23:22.696 --> 00:23:26.818]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:31.239]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:36.481]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:23:36.861 --> 00:23:40.443]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[00:24:13.988 --> 00:24:20.193]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:24:20.653 --> 00:24:28.439]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:36.626]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:24:36.946 --> 00:24:41.707]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:24:42.027 --> 00:24:46.708]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:24:47.248 --> 00:24:51.109]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:24:51.609 --> 00:24:52.609]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:24:52.689 --> 00:24:56.770]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:01.591]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:04.592]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:26:15.563 --> 00:26:18.325]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:26:18.345 --> 00:26:22.208]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.091]  Let's continue with your calls.
[00:26:26.812 --> 00:26:28.533]  And we've got General Parton coming on.
[00:26:29.994 --> 00:26:34.478]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Mike in Florida.
[00:26:34.538 --> 00:26:35.399]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:26:35.459 --> 00:26:35.779]  Welcome.
[00:26:38.717 --> 00:26:39.357]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:26:39.377 --> 00:26:39.978]  You're on the air.
[00:26:40.078 --> 00:26:40.598]  Hi, Alex.
[00:26:40.638 --> 00:26:40.998]  How are you?
[00:26:41.178 --> 00:26:41.419]  Good.
[00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:47.702]  Alex, I'm trying to get some information on a person by the name of Victor Ashe.
[00:26:47.842 --> 00:26:51.124]  Mayor of Victor Ashe, Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:26:51.784 --> 00:26:53.986]  Yeah, sounds to me like you've already got the information.
[00:26:54.686 --> 00:26:57.868]  Yeah, well, I read something on the internet.
[00:26:57.948 --> 00:27:05.172]  Sherman Skolnick, who's an investigative journalist, wrote an article about Victor Ashe.
[00:27:07.927 --> 00:27:12.769]  I said, you know, I betcha if anyone would know, Alex Jones would probably know.
[00:27:13.349 --> 00:27:26.075]  I don't know if what Kitty Kelly and Mr. Skolnick say is true, but they allege that him and Bush are special friends and I don't know if that's true, sir, and that's why I don't really get into it.
[00:27:27.755 --> 00:27:31.617]  Alright, well I'll do some more research and hopefully we can learn a little bit more.
[00:27:32.443 --> 00:27:33.043]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:27:33.123 --> 00:27:33.724]  Hey, thank you.
[00:27:33.804 --> 00:27:35.444]  I appreciate the call, Mike.
[00:27:35.605 --> 00:27:36.565]  Jim in Ohio.
[00:27:36.625 --> 00:27:37.425]  Jim, you're on the air.
[00:27:37.465 --> 00:27:37.806]  Welcome.
[00:27:38.526 --> 00:27:40.367]  Alex Jones, Rebel Without a Pause.
[00:27:40.427 --> 00:27:40.907]  How are you?
[00:27:41.487 --> 00:27:41.888]  Good, sir.
[00:27:42.168 --> 00:27:42.388]  Good.
[00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:51.152]  Hey, with all the talk of numerology regarding the New World Order and that and 9-1-1, I have kind of a theory I just wanted to run past you.
[00:27:51.172 --> 00:27:58.615]  I don't know what the satanic symbolism of it would be, but obviously in this country 9-1-1 is an easy one to remember in the emergency.
[00:27:58.635 --> 00:28:01.097]  Yeah, it's very archetypal, yes.
[00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:10.694]  Well, and you wonder, too, on that day, as clear of a day as it was, that what if that day would have been cloudy and overcast?
[00:28:10.754 --> 00:28:23.259]  It kind of lends credence that that had to be the day to stick in people's minds, and it just seems to add credence to the remote control possibilities of flying the planes into the towers in the Pentagon.
[00:28:23.299 --> 00:28:26.961]  Just kind of wondered what your thought was on that.
[00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:29.442]  I'm not quite getting what you're saying.
[00:28:30.123 --> 00:28:39.329]  Well, had these pilots, the terrorists supposedly, had the minimal capabilities to fly a plane.
[00:28:39.369 --> 00:28:47.134]  They needed the visual to come into New York and they had to pick an extremely clear day to pick up those towers from a distance.
[00:28:47.875 --> 00:28:57.541]  Now if it was an overcast day with low cloud cover and they were these amateur pilots supposedly, those people behind crashing
[00:28:58.089 --> 00:29:06.084]  The planes into the tower in the Pentagon weren't going to leave it up to their abilities to physically fly the planes in an overcast setting.
[00:29:06.124 --> 00:29:07.767]  That date was picked beforehand.
[00:29:09.051 --> 00:29:10.712]  Well, that's an interesting point.
[00:29:10.772 --> 00:29:21.116]  I just go off the fact that on that morning, the CIA was running an exact drill of planes being flown into those structures, just magically by accident.
[00:29:21.136 --> 00:29:22.056]  Well, that's ridiculous.
[00:29:22.496 --> 00:29:27.698]  And then we have NORAD standing down, and all these other points, and bin Laden's being flown out of the country.
[00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:31.640]  Then we have our internal sources, Stanley Hilton and others have deposed.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.021]  These high-level military officers and others.
[00:29:34.422 --> 00:29:39.265]  We have FBI agents saying we were told to back off the Bin Laden's W1999.
[00:29:39.665 --> 00:29:42.187]  That's really the meat-and-potatoes proof we've got.
[00:29:43.008 --> 00:29:58.338]  Well, and the other part of it, too, is everything that I've read from real pilots, you know, saying that the aerobatics that these guys had to go through to bring these planes in, especially into the Pentagon, and hit that thing the way that they did, especially on final approach,
[00:29:59.454 --> 00:30:03.998]  You know, experienced pilots with 25 years experience wouldn't be able to do that.
[00:30:04.198 --> 00:30:08.522]  Well, the quotes I've seen is 9 out of 10 times they wouldn't be able to do the Pentagon Maneuver.
[00:30:08.902 --> 00:30:09.242]  Correct.
[00:30:10.363 --> 00:30:11.004]  Just my thought.
[00:30:11.604 --> 00:30:14.006]  No, it's all points that have to be made.
[00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:15.928]  Their official story is impossible.
[00:30:15.988 --> 00:30:18.330]  It's the wildest conspiracy theory of them all.
[00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.270]  Thank you, Jim.
[00:30:20.071 --> 00:30:20.912]  Who's up next here?
[00:30:23.215 --> 00:30:24.416]  Mary in Colorado.
[00:30:24.436 --> 00:30:24.976]  You're on the air.
[00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:25.716]  Thanks for holding.
[00:30:25.736 --> 00:30:26.157]  Go ahead.
[00:30:26.657 --> 00:30:27.277]  Good morning.
[00:30:27.317 --> 00:30:29.758]  Well, that Bush oil outfit, they have to go.
[00:30:30.859 --> 00:30:32.660]  Condoleezza didn't do her job.
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.800]  She fell down on the job.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.281]  And Bush didn't do his job.
[00:30:35.341 --> 00:30:37.322]  And they're just... You can't trust them.
[00:30:38.083 --> 00:30:48.148]  And another thing that scares me is this big oil pipeline that is being run from Abu Dhabi, I'm probably pronouncing it wrong, into Georgia.
[00:30:48.168 --> 00:30:50.609]  That's where Russia used to be.
[00:30:51.209 --> 00:30:52.570]  And then into Turkey.
[00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:58.272]  And we have both Russian, we have a Russian station and an American station.
[00:30:58.892 --> 00:31:06.216]  Our soldiers and marines are stationed, our military is stationed in Georgia and so is the Russian military.
[00:31:06.276 --> 00:31:09.878]  Well they have said that we're going to be merging in these countries.
[00:31:09.898 --> 00:31:13.940]  We're going to invade all these countries together with our new friend Russia.
[00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:15.842]  They're helping us.
[00:31:15.862 --> 00:31:19.464]  Well, Russia's never been a friend of ours.
[00:31:19.704 --> 00:31:22.025]  I don't think they can be trusted across the street.
[00:31:22.785 --> 00:31:33.518]  And I'm looking at history, and I think if you want to know the truth, I appreciated what President Clinton put in his book.
[00:31:33.798 --> 00:31:34.399]  I believe him.
[00:31:34.499 --> 00:31:35.120]  I trust him.
[00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:36.762]  I trust the Democrats.
[00:31:38.971 --> 00:31:41.253]  So anyway, I want that Bush outfit out of there.
[00:31:41.473 --> 00:31:42.394]  They're messing with trouble.
[00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:44.075]  They aren't up to that job, okay?
[00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:46.757]  Alright, thanks for the call, uh, Mary.
[00:31:47.037 --> 00:31:48.378]  Uh, look.
[00:31:49.259 --> 00:31:51.480]  They all work for the same bosses.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.322]  It's the same policies.
[00:31:53.722 --> 00:31:54.803]  Gary's for the war.
[00:31:55.403 --> 00:31:56.484]  Gary's for all of it.
[00:31:56.524 --> 00:31:58.165]  And see, the conservatives hate the liberals.
[00:31:58.185 --> 00:31:59.386]  The liberals hate the conservatives.
[00:31:59.826 --> 00:32:01.167]  And that's how they've got us captured.
[00:32:01.588 --> 00:32:03.309]  We need to get outside that false box.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.263]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:32:09.143 --> 00:32:11.906]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:32:14.828 --> 00:32:17.250]  Are you paying too much for term life insurance?
[00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:22.274]  There is a tremendous price for among the major term life companies and you may be paying too much.

[00:32:30.461 --> 00:32:31.201]  Level for the next 10 years.
[00:32:33.423 --> 00:32:40.349]  Or a man age 50, non-tobacco user issue preferred, can obtain $500,000 of coverage for a monthly premium of only $113.
[00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.412]  Guaranteed not to change for the next 20 years.
[00:32:44.752 --> 00:32:45.333]  That's right!
[00:32:45.673 --> 00:32:48.315]  Guaranteed level rates for the next 20 years.
[00:32:48.475 --> 00:32:51.558]  If you're a smoker, there are great rates available for you as well.
[00:32:51.778 --> 00:32:57.022]  Term Busters specializes in term life insurance policies of $500,000 or more.

[00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:24.255]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:34:24.555 --> 00:34:28.978]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:34:29.238 --> 00:34:39.086]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.

[00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.351]  These days, that's just plain smart.

[00:35:19.941 --> 00:35:21.862]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:35:22.342 --> 00:35:25.203]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:28.824 --> 00:35:29.864]  Mission impossible!
[00:35:29.884 --> 00:35:31.025]  Defeat the globalists!
[00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:31.805]  Takeover!
[00:35:33.625 --> 00:35:37.527]  People running this country and running the planet created the communists, the Nazis.
[00:35:38.107 --> 00:35:44.889]  They create the centralized systems as Professor Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor, admitted in his own 900-page book, Tragedy and Hope.
[00:35:45.942 --> 00:35:47.543]  They have set up their new world order.
[00:35:48.183 --> 00:35:49.524]  It is now upon us.
[00:35:49.604 --> 00:35:51.826]  In a few minutes we're going to go to General Benton K. Parton.
[00:35:52.666 --> 00:35:53.467]  Brigadier General.
[00:35:53.947 --> 00:35:54.548]  Retired.
[00:35:54.908 --> 00:35:56.449]  We've had him on the broadcast many times.
[00:35:56.489 --> 00:35:57.730]  Haven't had him on in a long time.
[00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:59.511]  It's time to have him back.
[00:35:59.531 --> 00:36:04.294]  I remember I first interviewed him, I don't know, five or six years ago.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:16.162]  And he always stressed, look, the Pentagon's going to come out with a plan, there's people pushing it, that China and Russia are friends, that they're not a threat, that we're going to have to work together to go into all these countries.
[00:36:16.742 --> 00:36:18.643]  And now they're openly saying that.
[00:36:18.663 --> 00:36:21.523]  We were going to have Thomas Barnett on, the Pentagon's new map.
[00:36:21.543 --> 00:36:26.624]  He took one look at my website and I called him up and said, why aren't you coming on?
[00:36:26.664 --> 00:36:27.685]  He got really upset.
[00:36:27.705 --> 00:36:31.245]  I already talked about that and began being very profane with me.
[00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:33.966]  I've never experienced that before.
[00:36:35.616 --> 00:36:38.057]  But we're going to talk about General Parton.
[00:36:38.097 --> 00:36:43.441]  He hasn't seen Barnett's big presentation I watched on C-SPAN a few weeks ago to the Pentagon.
[00:36:44.302 --> 00:36:45.523]  He's from the Naval War College.
[00:36:46.523 --> 00:36:52.768]  But everything that Parton has talked about in the past and written about, written papers for the Pentagon on, is exactly what I was watching.
[00:36:53.108 --> 00:36:57.211]  This guy was chastising the brass for still thinking that China is a threat.
[00:36:57.351 --> 00:36:58.272]  I mean, it was amazing.
[00:36:59.693 --> 00:37:01.734]  So that's just some of what we'll talk about.
[00:37:01.774 --> 00:37:02.855]  I mean, it was terrifying.
[00:37:03.395 --> 00:37:04.416]  Literally, I sat there
[00:37:05.111 --> 00:37:06.674]  Just, just, just shocked to watch it.
[00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:11.683]  Before we go to General Partin, my new film, American Dictators, is out.
[00:37:11.723 --> 00:37:12.765]  It's 90 minutes long.
[00:37:12.825 --> 00:37:17.434]  It shows Bush and Kerry being cousins, skull and bones members, almost with the exact same policies.
[00:37:18.426 --> 00:37:20.587]  We get into the whole police state that's being set up, 9-11.
[00:37:21.267 --> 00:37:23.228]  It's my new film, American Dictators, 1995.
[00:37:23.789 --> 00:37:27.430]  I also have 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror.
[00:37:27.971 --> 00:37:31.072]  We have Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, my police state films.
[00:37:31.372 --> 00:37:33.814]  My film Matrix of Evil with Ron Paul and others.
[00:37:34.274 --> 00:37:35.554]  You need to get these films.
[00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:38.076]  Some are $19.95.
[00:37:38.436 --> 00:37:42.778]  My first ten films are $25.95 because they're all over two hours long, some almost three hours.
[00:37:43.078 --> 00:37:44.959]  They're $20 if you order three or more.
[00:37:46.252 --> 00:37:51.437]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart.

[00:38:16.496 --> 00:38:19.597]  You can't make copies, obviously, of other people's films I carry.
[00:38:19.657 --> 00:38:21.217]  So I hope you take action.
[00:38:21.237 --> 00:38:22.097]  I hope you get the films.
[00:38:22.118 --> 00:38:22.838]  I hope you warn people.
[00:38:37.071 --> 00:38:39.837]  Now, I want to read this before we go to General Parton, who I appreciate holding.
[00:38:39.977 --> 00:38:44.667]  This is from Professor Quigley's 1966 book, Tragedy and Hope.
[00:38:46.118 --> 00:38:54.062]  There does exist and has existed for a generation an international network which operates to some extent in the way the Radical Right believes the Communist Act.
[00:38:54.463 --> 00:39:04.208]  In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Roundtable Groups, CFR, Tribunal Commission, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists or any other groups and frequently does so.
[00:39:04.788 --> 00:39:13.213]  I know of their operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years in the early sixties to examine its papers and secret records.
[00:39:13.793 --> 00:39:19.277]  I have no aversion to it or most of its aims, and have, for much of my life, been close to it and many of its instruments.
[00:39:19.937 --> 00:39:34.106]  I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies, but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known, Professor Carl Quigley, in his book, Tragedy and Hope.
[00:39:34.606 --> 00:39:42.271]  In his first State of the Union, Bill Clinton said, I owe it all to this man, he's my mentor, the head of Political Science Department at Georgetown University.
[00:39:42.331 --> 00:39:42.471]  Now,
[00:39:44.253 --> 00:40:00.542]  Again, in the final model of what the Communists said they would do, part of their program, as General Parton has laid it out, and as my own research has shown, again, this is all controlled by big financial interests that want to use Communist terror to take over countries.
[00:40:00.582 --> 00:40:02.182]  Now they call it, you know, globalism.
[00:40:02.203 --> 00:40:03.203]  They have different names for it.
[00:40:04.704 --> 00:40:12.468]  Their plan is to take over every country in the world, and they're going to use the threat of terrorism to do it, and they are doing it right now.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:21.464]  And it is horrible to watch it happening, to watch Russia going into NATO, to watch NATO going global, to watch all this develop.
[00:40:21.824 --> 00:40:25.686]  And the real expert on this is General Partin, joining us a little bit early on the show today.
[00:40:25.726 --> 00:40:26.527]  We're honored to have him.
[00:40:27.047 --> 00:40:27.987]  General, good to have you on.
[00:40:28.007 --> 00:40:30.388]  My pleasure being on your show again, Alex.
[00:40:31.289 --> 00:40:31.689]  Thank you.
[00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:37.652]  I know you're not too familiar with Barnett himself, you've done some research, but this whole group in the Pentagon that is
[00:40:39.587 --> 00:40:51.550]  You know, saying China and Russia are good buddies, and shifting us into this new model, saying China isn't communist, chastising the true conservatives in the Pentagon.
[00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:55.791]  Can you give us the real map of the world, General?
[00:40:55.811 --> 00:41:05.434]  Look, I haven't written much of Barnett's paper, but you don't have to get into but a few hundred words before you can see that he's mouthing
[00:41:06.729 --> 00:41:12.314]  The global program that the communist world laid out back after World War II.
[00:41:13.055 --> 00:41:24.505]  Excuse me, after World War I. Now look, Alex, I ran into the same sort of thing, gosh, 30, 40 years ago when I was at the War College myself.
[00:41:25.346 --> 00:41:27.488]  I had turned out a book on the Sino-Soviet split.
[00:41:28.198 --> 00:41:39.241]  And I did the first-class operations research kind of techniques, and I proved without question the sign of the Soviet split was one of the highest payoff operations that the Soviet Union ever got into.
[00:41:40.261 --> 00:41:50.984]  And Anatoly Golitsyn, 17 years later, came out with a book, New Lives for All, and he said the sign of the Soviet split was a strategic disinformation program.
[00:41:51.564 --> 00:41:56.605]  And then 27 years after I did my book, he wrote this book,
[00:41:57.566 --> 00:42:00.208]  The Sino- what was it?
[00:42:00.468 --> 00:42:01.509]  Perestroika Deception!
[00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:10.456]  And he said, not only was it the key dis- it was the key disinformation program on which all other disinformation programs depended.
[00:42:10.876 --> 00:42:18.321]  It was rather interesting at that time, you know, if you'd done a dissertation or thesis, you didn't have to do another one at the War College.
[00:42:18.922 --> 00:42:21.664]  And so I did one on this Sino-Soviet split thing.
[00:42:22.324 --> 00:42:25.807]  And it was, that's almost a 200 book, extensively documented.
[00:42:26.451 --> 00:42:31.296]  And I tried to, my faculty advisor wanted to distribute it very extensively.
[00:42:31.917 --> 00:42:41.727]  Well, the little group, the little think tank groups like you have down at the War College, at the Naval War College, they had one guy in that group who was a propagandist for the sign of the Soviet Spring.
[00:42:42.869 --> 00:42:45.912]  So it didn't get distributed, but you know, three or four copies went out.
[00:42:45.932 --> 00:42:46.913]  You can get a copy of the
[00:42:47.435 --> 00:42:47.916]  I think so.
[00:43:04.634 --> 00:43:09.437]  It was really an extension of Walt's sequential sampling theory.
[00:43:09.457 --> 00:43:16.641]  No one on earth in the Air Force should be interested in that if they weren't in quality control or sequential testing of expensive items.
[00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:20.383]  But my gosh, that thing was distributed in dozens all over the place.
[00:43:21.484 --> 00:43:29.248]  And one guy in there, when my faculty advisor wanted him to print it in the annual, the quarterly publication that came out of the War College,
[00:43:30.055 --> 00:43:38.458]  They said, well, we were planning to publish an article to the contrary thesis of the legitimacy and irreversibility of the sign of service.
[00:43:39.018 --> 00:43:54.323]  So, one guy was able to turn things around to keep that information from getting out, but Glitzen, who was in the Soviet Union, trained in the Soviet Union, when he was posted to Finland, he defected to the United States, and you know, he served as an advisor to the CIA for a long time.
[00:43:55.624 --> 00:43:58.105]  But, it just shows you that
[00:43:59.508 --> 00:44:04.253]  Some of these think tanks and people out there get way off on the wrong foot.
[00:44:04.974 --> 00:44:08.037]  The seminal document on terrorism to this day.
[00:44:08.438 --> 00:44:14.264]  The seminal document was a document written by Leon Trotsky when he was head of the Soviet military in 1922.
[00:44:16.502 --> 00:44:19.064]  That's the basic document on terrorism.
[00:44:19.104 --> 00:44:23.188]  That's how the Soviets have operated and are still operating.
[00:44:23.548 --> 00:44:28.072]  Last year they put the Red Stars back on their uniforms and back on their tanks and helicopters.
[00:44:28.192 --> 00:44:33.497]  And they have never taken the USSR logo off their media headings.
[00:44:34.298 --> 00:44:35.339]  They've never taken it off.
[00:44:35.979 --> 00:44:43.526]  But anyway, the Sino-Soviet split was a strategic disinformation program and it was one of the highest payoffs
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.861]  Well, let me stop you.
[00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:50.461]  You're using all these technical terms.
[00:44:50.681 --> 00:44:53.122]  Brigadier General, former head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[00:44:53.582 --> 00:45:00.645]  General, we need to be specific with listeners, even with myself, with these complex terms and issues that are whole areas of study and research.
[00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:03.746]  I mean, every word you're using is a four-year degree.
[00:45:04.206 --> 00:45:05.246]  I don't need to go into this.
[00:45:05.727 --> 00:45:15.931]  I'm sitting here for two hours, two weekends ago, watching this Thomas Barnett guy, word for word, say everything you've said, but flipping it around and saying it's good.
[00:45:16.031 --> 00:45:17.211]  China's not communist.
[00:45:17.311 --> 00:45:19.412]  Chastising the room full of brass.
[00:45:20.313 --> 00:45:21.293]  Russia's our friend.
[00:45:22.156 --> 00:45:23.738]  We're going to fight terror together.
[00:45:24.098 --> 00:45:26.281]  We work for the big global corporations.
[00:45:26.341 --> 00:45:27.863]  Wall Street loves this plan.
[00:45:28.163 --> 00:45:31.307]  We've got new rule sets for globalism.
[00:45:32.008 --> 00:45:33.690]  China and Russia are our buddies.
[00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:36.253]  We're going to go into the whole planet with them.
[00:45:36.513 --> 00:45:40.138]  All of this, and I'm watching this with my mouth hanging open,
[00:45:41.437 --> 00:45:47.279]  Can you speak specifically, because a lot of these guys, it showed the brass, they were nodding and loving it.
[00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:58.202]  Some looked like they were about to have a heart attack watching this guy, but this is the dominant model that Bush and Rumsfeld and Kerry and all of them are pushing and promoting.
[00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:06.884]  Well, irrespective of who's pushing what, let me just give you the facts, and these facts are very predictable.
[00:46:06.944 --> 00:46:08.344]  But please put it in layman's terms.
[00:46:08.664 --> 00:46:10.725]  Give us the real world map of what's happening.
[00:46:11.232 --> 00:46:20.559]  Well, let me give you just a quick outline, and I've been using this chart for the last ten years around, and discussing the subject, the very subject you're talking about.
[00:46:21.179 --> 00:46:33.809]  And I go right back to the 1928 program, and when the Communist International, the third international, it wasn't the first, it wasn't the second, it was the third international, it was the Lenin International, was set up in 1919.
[00:46:36.691 --> 00:46:40.594]  They set up a think tank group of their best and brightest from around the world,
[00:46:41.434 --> 00:46:50.638]  To come up with what they call the program of the Third International, designed to transform every square inch of the world into this New World Order.
[00:46:51.699 --> 00:46:52.879]  Every square inch of the world.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.241]  They worked on it for nine years.
[00:46:56.061 --> 00:46:57.842]  They had eleven plenary sessions.
[00:46:58.402 --> 00:47:04.585]  The people involved in that committee were their best and brightest, not just from Russia, but from all over the world.
[00:47:05.425 --> 00:47:07.466]  It was a group of people from all over the world.
[00:47:07.546 --> 00:47:09.607]  And at the Sixth Party Congress in Moscow in 1928,
[00:47:11.354 --> 00:47:16.616]  They adopted the program to transform the world.
[00:47:16.996 --> 00:47:22.179]  They had another document, a big part of that effort was Wars of National Liberation.
[00:47:22.419 --> 00:47:25.680]  Castro came to power by a classic War of National Liberation.
[00:47:26.801 --> 00:47:35.484]  They had a separate item because most of the world was to be transitioned and transformed into socialism by a War of National Liberation.
[00:47:39.004 --> 00:47:42.125]  They divided the world up into three different groups.
[00:47:42.805 --> 00:47:47.587]  One was what they called a capitalist world, which is to be transitioned by democratic processes.
[00:47:48.147 --> 00:47:50.848]  And that was Western Europe, Australia, and Japan.
[00:47:51.668 --> 00:47:53.809]  And to a certain extent, the United States.
[00:47:53.849 --> 00:47:56.110]  They considered the United States a colonial country also.
[00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:01.032]  They were to be transformed by basically democratic processes.
[00:48:01.072 --> 00:48:05.093]  And most of all those countries in Western Europe now have a socialist chief of state.
[00:48:05.976 --> 00:48:15.279]  As you recall, they were going to move NATO east, and they brought Germany in, West Germany, East Germany in.
[00:48:15.519 --> 00:48:16.579]  Let me stop you right there.
[00:48:16.719 --> 00:48:32.704]  Again, everything you wrote about decades ago, everything you said would happen, happened, and now NATO is merging with Russia, now their planners are all over TV telling us this is good, they're shifting the Pentagon in domestically to control the populations, it's all happening.
[00:48:34.813 --> 00:48:50.337]  But all those predictions, well I have distributed a report, Deadly Failures and Intelligence Analysis, and I took from that book all the findings and conclusions and recommendations and extrapolations based on the fact that they were still following the 1928 program.
[00:48:50.357 --> 00:48:56.639]  But this proves your thesis because your roadmap, now decades old, has been exactly what's happened.
[00:48:56.759 --> 00:48:58.559]  Now let me give you the roadmap in the future.
[00:49:00.279 --> 00:49:00.780]  Give it to us.
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.280]  They had planned
[00:49:04.296 --> 00:49:06.838]  You'll not find any dates associated with that program.
[00:49:06.858 --> 00:49:08.238]  It's just like when you go to a theater.
[00:49:08.258 --> 00:49:10.340]  They don't give you a blueprint.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.881]  They don't give you a plan.
[00:49:14.502 --> 00:49:15.522]  They give you a program.
[00:49:16.483 --> 00:49:20.405]  And that indicates that you have the resources and everything to put on a play.
[00:49:20.885 --> 00:49:23.266]  Same thing is true with the program of the Third International.
[00:49:23.586 --> 00:49:26.288]  It's an active document to transform the world.
[00:49:26.808 --> 00:49:32.911]  Now, they had planned to have, by the year 2000, what they called a World Commonwealth of Independent States.
[00:49:34.145 --> 00:49:34.686]  The year 2000.
[00:49:35.266 --> 00:49:42.013]  If you read their party literature and leftist stuff today, you'll find they are claiming they have slipped a few years.
[00:49:42.073 --> 00:49:42.533]  Not many.
[00:49:42.653 --> 00:49:51.562]  But then the exact same program is brought forward by the so-called capitalist states with their globalization or their new world order, and then we catch the big banks funding the communists.
[00:49:51.782 --> 00:49:53.764]  Well, let me just step through this.
[00:49:53.804 --> 00:49:54.925]  It won't take but a minute or two.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:00.982]  They had planned to have, by the year 2000, a World Commonwealth of Independent States.
[00:50:01.042 --> 00:50:02.542]  And what do they call themselves today?
[00:50:02.762 --> 00:50:03.523]  The CIS.
[00:50:03.623 --> 00:50:05.083]  The Commonwealth of Independent States.
[00:50:05.623 --> 00:50:06.464]  And what's the Commonwealth?
[00:50:06.624 --> 00:50:07.624]  It's a loose federation.
[00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:08.284]  Alright?
[00:50:08.924 --> 00:50:14.987]  They move into that in what they call the Global Corporate Socialism, or Globalism.
[00:50:15.367 --> 00:50:19.428]  That's their term, Globalism, for this Global Corporate Socialism.
[00:50:20.028 --> 00:50:24.610]  And that's where you take all these global cartels for the production and distribution of goods and services.
[00:50:25.129 --> 00:50:25.429]  I think?
[00:50:47.834 --> 00:50:50.535]  Under the heading of interdependence.
[00:50:50.815 --> 00:50:57.036]  Remember we had a declaration of interdependence passed by many members of the Congress decades ago.
[00:50:58.056 --> 00:51:05.818]  Then you have the withering away of the state because you have this global structure and you move into what they call regional government.
[00:51:06.078 --> 00:51:12.840]  You have a global hierarchy of regional government to give you what they call in this world program
[00:51:13.703 --> 00:51:25.545]  World Communism, or a New World Order, and this is a world without nations, a world without nationalities, a world without borders, a world without war, and a world without competition.
[00:51:26.666 --> 00:51:30.306]  And from that you develop the great socialist man, the Soviet man.
[00:51:30.907 --> 00:51:32.447]  That's their program for the future.
[00:51:32.667 --> 00:51:37.968]  Now what this guy's talking about in the book is globalism, which is a part of that program.
[00:51:39.224 --> 00:51:40.785]  A very specific part.
[00:51:41.006 --> 00:51:43.448]  Well, you read the program of 1919 that's... 1928.
[00:51:44.669 --> 00:51:49.152]  Yeah, and expanded from 1919, as you said, though.
[00:51:49.192 --> 00:51:52.615]  Well, that's when they set up the Third International.
[00:51:52.835 --> 00:52:02.383]  But they had this study group that worked on perfecting this gradualistic program, and they didn't approve that until 1928.
[00:52:02.644 --> 00:52:05.486]  In 1935, they had the Seventh Party Congress, and this was a global operation.
[00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:09.557]  In the 7th Party Congress in Moscow there were over 532 delegates.
[00:52:09.577 --> 00:52:10.860]  25 of them were from the United States.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.721]  Let me just add this to this.
[00:52:18.402 --> 00:52:20.023]  Then the United Nations is set up.
[00:52:20.163 --> 00:52:23.344]  It's there to carry all of this out, along with the so-called trade groups.
[00:52:23.505 --> 00:52:25.626]  That's how the EU started, as a quote, trade group.
[00:52:25.806 --> 00:52:26.326]  Sure.
[00:52:26.366 --> 00:52:34.890]  But General Parton, if people look at the public program, it's exactly what's happened, and then we've got all the so-called conservatives out there promoting it.
[00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:41.734]  You name me one four-star general, one governor, one senator who's ever known anything about the program of the Third International.
[00:52:42.194 --> 00:52:42.434]  Nothing.
[00:52:43.476 --> 00:52:46.659]  It's been suppressed by all media and news media out there.
[00:52:46.699 --> 00:52:51.162]  I've been trying to get my word out on it and talk show after talk show, but it's been totally suppressed.
[00:52:51.403 --> 00:52:52.784]  But the proof is in the pudding.
[00:52:53.164 --> 00:52:53.584]  Sure it is!
[00:52:53.865 --> 00:52:56.307]  What is in the program is now what has happened.
[00:52:57.087 --> 00:53:00.150]  And happening... Unbelievable.
[00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:06.715]  Yeah, let's talk about where it's going, what life will be like under this, how to defeat it, and a lot more with General Parton.
[00:53:06.755 --> 00:53:11.239]  This is very important, ladies and gentlemen, and it's also very frightening.
[00:53:11.259 --> 00:53:12.300]  We've got to stand and fight this.
[00:53:14.855 --> 00:53:21.697]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:53:22.017 --> 00:53:23.378]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:53:23.578 --> 00:53:25.778]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:53:25.938 --> 00:53:28.019]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:53:28.299 --> 00:53:33.221]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:53:33.561 --> 00:53:37.602]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:53:37.842 --> 00:53:39.624]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:53:39.704 --> 00:53:50.374]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:53:50.514 --> 00:53:52.416]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:53:52.616 --> 00:53:56.479]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[00:53:56.579 --> 00:53:57.840]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:54:01.924 --> 00:54:03.888]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:54:03.988 --> 00:54:08.676]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:54:08.936 --> 00:54:09.717]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:16.973]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:54:17.293 --> 00:54:22.216]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:54:22.476 --> 00:54:26.838]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:54:27.119 --> 00:54:36.044]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:54:36.244 --> 00:54:39.866]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:54:40.146 --> 00:54:45.189]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:52.214]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:54:52.694 --> 00:54:53.235]  What about you?
[00:54:53.994 --> 00:54:59.357]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:54:59.397 --> 00:55:00.437]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:55:00.577 --> 00:55:02.458]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:55:15.129 --> 00:55:15.410]  Thank you.
[00:55:30.251 --> 00:55:30.912]  We're good to go!
[00:55:59.793 --> 00:56:02.874]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:56:03.035 --> 00:56:08.997]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:56:23.023 --> 00:56:26.085]  Alright, General Martin has an exemplary service record.
[00:56:26.185 --> 00:56:28.526]  He's done an incredible job defending this country.
[00:56:30.647 --> 00:56:54.734]  and some people get confused by this whole term communist but you notice that when McCarthy then accused the army of being involved in this and accused Wall Street of being involved which now has been publicly proven uh... they totally freaked out and finally went after him and it was just oh it's the leftists and oh it's the communists and oh you know it's just these little small groups doing this it was fine and dandy but when the big picture came out
[00:56:56.693 --> 00:57:01.136]  That it was big financial interest behind this to have this criminal consolidation.
[00:57:01.196 --> 00:57:02.197]  I don't call it communism.
[00:57:02.217 --> 00:57:06.319]  I call it organized crime using this communist model to consolidate.
[00:57:06.339 --> 00:57:09.622]  But it'll be the economic elite sitting on top of that and controlling it.
[00:57:09.642 --> 00:57:19.108]  And everything they passed and brought forward in 1919, 1928, and 1935, those plans have now all happened.
[00:57:19.168 --> 00:57:20.269]  The global government's here.
[00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:22.490]  It's all developing.
[00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:23.230]  It's all happening.
[00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:25.352]  They're telling us Russia and China are good buddies.
[00:57:26.685 --> 00:57:28.767]  And the police state's being set up in America.
[00:57:28.847 --> 00:57:32.070]  Our police are starting to do things just like they do in Russia or China.
[00:57:32.391 --> 00:57:33.812]  Our liberties are being scrapped.
[00:57:34.433 --> 00:57:35.373]  All of this is happening.
[00:57:35.393 --> 00:57:37.555]  We'll get more into it in the next hour with General Partin.
[00:57:37.616 --> 00:57:39.517]  We'll also have time to go to your calls.
[00:57:39.557 --> 00:57:44.662]  But General Partin, how do we stop this program?
[00:57:45.243 --> 00:57:46.444]  How do we expose this?
[00:57:46.524 --> 00:57:47.545]  Because, you know, they
[00:57:49.105 --> 00:57:57.270]  Both parties, all these governments, they're carrying out the program, and the few countries that aren't are being attacked and being called terrorists.
[00:57:58.891 --> 00:58:06.896]  Well, you can't say any country is not, because the 1928 program targeted every country in the world.
[00:58:07.688 --> 00:58:11.191]  And they identified the strategy to be used with those countries.
[00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:14.253]  And they have been carrying them out ever since.
[00:58:14.473 --> 00:58:16.495]  And they're not drugged out.
[00:58:16.535 --> 00:58:18.717]  They're not things that are instantaneous.
[00:58:18.737 --> 00:58:21.299]  They're all drugged out and programmed over a long period of time.
[00:58:21.699 --> 00:58:23.280]  That's the Leninist method.
[00:58:24.041 --> 00:58:27.444]  The Trotsky method is here and now over the borders of invasion.
[00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:29.786]  The Lenin method is gradual.
[00:58:29.826 --> 00:58:31.967]  And that's what the program of the Third International was.
[00:58:32.007 --> 00:58:33.028]  It's what they're still following.
[00:58:33.088 --> 00:58:34.049]  It's what they're still doing.
[00:58:34.508 --> 00:58:37.370]  And it permeates almost every area of endeavor out there.
[00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:46.175]  Let me just... One area, and I know some people will freak out on this, but the business of ecology and environmentalism in this country.
[00:58:46.775 --> 00:58:49.397]  Is that being used as part of the program of 3rd International?
[00:58:49.417 --> 00:58:50.017]  You bet it is!
[00:58:50.538 --> 00:58:57.942]  Because they say in the program of 3rd International, one of our ultimate objectives is to control the forces of nature.
[00:58:58.823 --> 00:59:00.964]  There's no God, so we're going to do it ourselves.
[00:59:01.548 --> 00:59:10.311]  And Gus Hall, who was the head of the Communist Party of the United States for several decades, in 1972 he wrote a book called Ecology.
[00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:12.832]  Can We Survive Under Capitalism?
[00:59:13.152 --> 00:59:14.273]  Let me just tell you what he says.
[00:59:14.713 --> 00:59:20.295]  The crisis of the environment, like other crises, has its roots in the inherent characteristic of capitalism.
[00:59:20.939 --> 00:59:34.841]  The drive for private profits, which insists on the exploitation and racism, and promotes war and domestic violence, also includes an utterly reckless disregard for natural resources and the consequent contamination of the environment.
[00:59:35.062 --> 00:59:39.682]  What country out there has had more contamination of their environment than the former Soviet Union?
[00:59:40.362 --> 00:59:49.024]  The ultimate solution, this is over in the middle of the book, he says, the ultimate solution, of course, is the creation of a planned society in which the quest for profits has been abolished
[00:59:49.372 --> 00:59:55.156]  And the results of our science and technology are used for the benefits of the masses of the people of our nation.
[00:59:55.696 --> 00:59:58.258]  Now, listen to the last thing, last thing he says in the book.
[00:59:58.779 --> 01:00:14.009]  He says, it is hoped that this book will be a factor in helping the millions who are getting the experience of struggle in the movement against pollution to become a new force in the transition from capitalism to socialism.
[01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:15.010]  Let me comment on that.
[01:00:15.874 --> 01:00:21.137]  The well-meaning people that are out there trying to stop degradation of the environment, that's legitimate.
[01:00:21.237 --> 01:00:27.822]  But when I go to these smart growth conferences, these environmental conferences, it's the big banks, it's the military, it's the government.
[01:00:28.242 --> 01:00:35.546]  It's being used to criminally consolidate and destroy the general public, being able to have private property.
[01:00:38.726 --> 01:00:42.487]  To expand a global government to regulate and control that, General?
[01:00:42.507 --> 01:00:57.329]  Look, you will not find the communist program, or people active in this socialist internationalism, you will not find them participating in anything that you cannot find some legitimate support.
[01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:59.610]  For example, in Canada- Stay there!
[01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:00.890]  No, I agree, that's the point!
[01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:03.191]  We gotta break, you're absolutely right, we'll be right back.
[01:01:05.031 --> 01:01:05.531]  Hello, folks!
[01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:11.975]  Big Brother.
[01:01:12.656 --> 01:01:13.716]  Mainstream media.
[01:01:14.417 --> 01:01:15.498]  Government cover-ups.
[01:01:16.178 --> 01:01:17.019]  You want answers?
[01:01:17.759 --> 01:01:18.660]  Well, so does he.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.963]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:01:23.503 --> 01:01:27.626]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:01:27.746 --> 01:01:39.134]  We're talking to a man who served his country for decades, former head of Air Force Weapons Development, Brigadier General Benton K. Barton.
[01:01:40.914 --> 01:01:44.375]  Helped expose the reality of what happened at Oklahoma City under Lord Clinton.
[01:01:47.095 --> 01:01:54.277]  And, again, for decades he has been exposing the program of what I call the globalists.
[01:01:54.297 --> 01:01:57.358]  But again, he points out that the communists are the ones that came forward with this.
[01:01:57.378 --> 01:02:00.458]  But I point out that international banking funding created this.
[01:02:00.778 --> 01:02:03.139]  That's one side of the vice grip.
[01:02:03.835 --> 01:02:14.488]  And the leftists won't wake up to this until you point out to them that big corporations are for globalism and are for the communist plan, and at that minute we can deprogram them.
[01:02:14.548 --> 01:02:21.737]  If we have this argument in a left-right debate, instead of a freedom versus slavery debate, they never wake up.
[01:02:22.347 --> 01:02:31.250]  But I have found that if you show them that the big money that's not free market is behind communism, that this is organized crime, they will wake up.
[01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:34.811]  General Parton, can you speak to what I've just said, or do you agree with that?
[01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:41.853]  Well, the program of the Third International calls for the establishment of a global Fed.
[01:02:42.233 --> 01:02:43.433]  A global one world bank.
[01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:44.274]  One bank.
[01:02:44.634 --> 01:02:45.494]  A global bank.
[01:02:46.634 --> 01:02:47.334]  A global Fed.
[01:02:47.394 --> 01:02:49.055]  It's spelled out in the program.
[01:02:50.999 --> 01:02:57.225]  And you're going to have a tiny elite running that, and so again, what communism says it is publicly, is a total fraud.
[01:02:57.425 --> 01:03:00.848]  See, it doesn't really matter what you define communism as.
[01:03:01.168 --> 01:03:01.409]  Yes.
[01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:04.512]  They've laid out a program for transforming the world.
[01:03:04.752 --> 01:03:06.053]  And that program is being followed?
[01:03:06.433 --> 01:03:07.294]  It is being followed.
[01:03:08.155 --> 01:03:08.735]  Slavishly.
[01:03:09.376 --> 01:03:14.261]  So what do you want to say to the average leftist who means well, who isn't evil, who's been conned by this?
[01:03:14.561 --> 01:03:15.502]  How do you get to them?
[01:03:15.522 --> 01:03:16.783]  Because I've been able to get to them.
[01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:21.834]  Have you ever won a political argument with anybody?
[01:03:21.854 --> 01:03:23.174]  Uh, yes.
[01:03:23.974 --> 01:03:24.754]  Very seldom.
[01:03:25.075 --> 01:03:26.235]  I win them all the time, General.
[01:03:26.715 --> 01:03:35.237]  I know you win them all the time over a period of time, but it is a matter of exposing people to information and keep feeding it to them gradually, and they'll finally turn around.
[01:03:36.097 --> 01:03:42.859]  But it's very, very difficult to win a political argument because each of you are arguing your own points and not seeing what the other one is saying.
[01:03:43.459 --> 01:03:44.859]  Generally, it's very difficult.
[01:03:44.919 --> 01:03:46.760]  You don't swing many people in politics.
[01:03:47.742 --> 01:03:49.143]  How are you going to turn this thing around?
[01:03:49.383 --> 01:03:50.464]  You've got to do it politically.
[01:03:50.484 --> 01:03:51.204]  There's no other way.
[01:03:52.145 --> 01:03:58.569]  And the biggest problem we have, one of the biggest problems we have in this country today, is that good people have abandoned the political process.
[01:03:59.548 --> 01:04:04.671]  And you won't find a church out there who doesn't, say, discourage people from participating in the political process.
[01:04:04.911 --> 01:04:08.033]  In fact, I invited an associate pastor to go to a meeting with me one time.
[01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:09.113]  It was a political meeting.
[01:04:09.153 --> 01:04:16.297]  At the time, I was chairman of the Fairfax County Republican Committee, which is the biggest political organization in the state and in the country at the time.
[01:04:16.698 --> 01:04:18.078]  There were two congressional districts.
[01:04:18.599 --> 01:04:24.382]  And the pastor, his boss, said, I don't want my people involved in anything outside of the church.
[01:04:25.481 --> 01:04:29.924]  Or does he think he's going to sustain his freedom to still run his church?
[01:04:29.944 --> 01:04:38.108]  No, you're right, but the World Council of Churches set up by Rockefellers... That's a front organization.
[01:04:38.509 --> 01:04:41.250]  They've taken over that organization so many years ago.
[01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:43.732]  It doesn't matter.
[01:04:43.852 --> 01:04:47.174]  One thing about organizations, they're there to be taken over.
[01:04:47.994 --> 01:04:49.115]  Or you can organize your own.
[01:04:50.629 --> 01:04:57.214]  Let me give you some quotes from Leon Trotsky's book, which is THE Bible in Terrorism.
[01:04:59.215 --> 01:05:02.877]  It was written in 1922, when he was head of the Soviet military.
[01:05:04.078 --> 01:05:06.499]  And it was titled, In Defense of Terrorism.
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.161]  In Defense of Terrorism.
[01:05:08.181 --> 01:05:14.925]  And the basic thesis of that book, from cover to cover, is if you don't support terrorism, you don't support the cause.
[01:05:15.623 --> 01:05:16.463]  Just that simple.
[01:05:17.004 --> 01:05:21.026]  Let me just pick up, these are direct quotes and little simple short phrases.
[01:05:21.226 --> 01:05:22.086]  I'll give you several of them.
[01:05:22.687 --> 01:05:24.347]  He says, Crush the enemy.
[01:05:24.668 --> 01:05:26.168]  Cut off the heads of traitors.
[01:05:26.368 --> 01:05:28.029]  Avenge treachery.
[01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:30.090]  Enemies of the new world order.
[01:05:30.110 --> 01:05:31.011]  That's what he calls it.
[01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:34.372]  Unity of will, unity of direction, unity of action.
[01:05:34.392 --> 01:05:36.553]  He calls this the vulgar class.
[01:05:37.014 --> 01:05:43.537]  He says, Our savagery toward the bourgeoisie which display no tendency to resist.
[01:05:44.312 --> 01:05:45.993]  No tendency to resist.
[01:05:46.033 --> 01:05:47.714]  Stay there, I want to repeat those quotes.
[01:05:48.234 --> 01:05:51.276]  Calling it the New World Order, and then who else says New World Order?
[01:05:51.576 --> 01:05:53.136]  This was a book by Trotsky.
[01:05:53.337 --> 01:05:54.137]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:54.177 --> 01:05:55.318]  Who else says New World Order?
[01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:57.719]  And who carries out this exact program?
[01:05:58.379 --> 01:06:00.640]  Our conservative leaders with the liberals.
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.321]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:09.361 --> 01:06:14.842]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:06:15.262 --> 01:06:19.503]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:06:19.723 --> 01:06:26.765]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:27.145 --> 01:06:33.247]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:33.387 --> 01:06:34.607]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:34.947 --> 01:06:37.910]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:40.032]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:40.373 --> 01:06:47.620]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.324]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:07:06.952 --> 01:07:08.574]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:07:08.694 --> 01:07:12.757]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:07:12.938 --> 01:07:15.820]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:22.626]  The powerful Black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:25.809]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:28.412]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:07:28.532 --> 01:07:33.256]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:48.010]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:54.696]  Supercharge your gravity filter today, and order a 2-pack of black mercury purification elements for only $96, or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-4-9-1.

[01:08:06.981 --> 01:08:08.641]  What really happened September 11th?
[01:08:08.781 --> 01:08:09.922]  And who stands to gain?
[01:08:10.582 --> 01:08:11.882]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:08:12.062 --> 01:08:17.823]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:08:18.083 --> 01:08:23.344]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:08:23.644 --> 01:08:26.285]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination
[01:08:26.585 --> 01:08:28.888]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:09:03.058 --> 01:09:05.199]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:09:11.483 --> 01:09:12.143]  Big Brother.
[01:09:12.803 --> 01:09:13.764]  Mainstream media.
[01:09:14.563 --> 01:09:15.684]  Government cover-ups.
[01:09:16.324 --> 01:09:17.185]  You want answers?
[01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:19.427]  Well, so does he.
[01:09:19.467 --> 01:09:23.330]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:09:23.650 --> 01:09:27.773]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:09:31.356 --> 01:09:37.921]  Here's Fabian socialist Bernard Shaw in his Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism, 1928.
[01:09:40.086 --> 01:09:42.687]  Under socialism, you would not be allowed to be poor.
[01:09:43.668 --> 01:09:48.570]  You would be forcibly fed, clothed, lodged, taught, and employed, whether you like it or not.
[01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:57.815]  If it were discovered that you had not the character and industry enough to be worth all this trouble, you might possibly be executed in a kindly manner.
[01:09:59.156 --> 01:10:01.097]  Now again, this is slavery, folks.
[01:10:01.878 --> 01:10:04.701]  And here's a Senate report, March 9th, 1933.
[01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:07.244]  The United States has been in a state of national emergency.
[01:10:07.605 --> 01:10:12.530]  A majority of the people of the United States have had their lives under emergency rule for 40 years.
[01:10:12.690 --> 01:10:19.398]  Freedoms and government procedures guaranteed by the Constitution have, in varying degrees, been abridged by laws
[01:10:19.918 --> 01:10:24.843]  Brought forth by States of National Emergency, Senate Report 93-549, 1973.
[01:10:25.183 --> 01:10:31.950]  Here's Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley, Sir Julian Huxley, First Director General of UNESCO.
[01:10:34.711 --> 01:10:54.275]  Even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO, that Bush has signed back onto, to see that the eugenics problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of these issues at stake so that much that is now unthinkable may at least become thinkable.
[01:10:55.535 --> 01:10:57.856]  Now, why am I reading those quotes?
[01:10:58.116 --> 01:10:59.476]  These are ruthless people.
[01:11:00.725 --> 01:11:05.669]  And General Partin, I want to get a clear answer from you on this, because this is what a lot of people don't understand.
[01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:14.256]  Big money, big banks, some of the oldest and richest families in the world were involved with the seed money for communism, that's admitted.
[01:11:15.096 --> 01:11:22.462]  They have been involved bolstering it and supporting it throughout its development, through setting up the UN, through putting communists in charge of it.
[01:11:23.283 --> 01:11:28.266]  Can you explain to us this paradigm for people out there that are listening?
[01:11:29.906 --> 01:11:40.011]  Well, the people with money out there, it doesn't mean that they earned that money from grassroots or growth capital kind of a way.
[01:11:40.612 --> 01:11:44.314]  Many of them have been spoon-fed, just like Cecil Rhodes.
[01:11:44.854 --> 01:11:51.077]  He was operating, he did a lot of things all over the world back there, setting up some of the leftist think tanks.
[01:11:51.835 --> 01:11:54.220]  But he was operating with Rothschild money.
[01:11:55.904 --> 01:11:57.808]  There's no question about the big money out there.
[01:11:57.828 --> 01:11:59.773]  A lot of the industry is set up in this country.
[01:11:59.793 --> 01:12:02.458]  The multinational corporations set up back there.
[01:12:03.095 --> 01:12:12.140]  The first half of this century, many of them were set up to provide the seed bases for this world socialist division of labor way downstream.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:26.947]  So the leftists, the grassroots leftists, I talk to them, they don't get this, but when I'm able to show them elitist-owned autobiographies where they brag that the big money uses communism to criminally consolidate wealth, I'm able to deprogram them on this point.
[01:12:27.968 --> 01:12:29.449]  That's what I'm bringing up to you, General.
[01:12:29.489 --> 01:12:35.216]  Yeah, but you see, some of those people who have that big money are not going to be deprogrammed by you because they're part of the system.
[01:12:35.296 --> 01:12:36.977]  Oh no, I'm not talking about big money people.
[01:12:37.037 --> 01:12:39.300]  No, no, they love it and they understand and hate our guts.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.844]  I'm talking about the grassroots not being fooled by them anymore.
[01:12:46.687 --> 01:12:58.796]  The grassroots people out there are really not informed about enough of a broad set of things to talk about the things we're trying to talk about here in this program.
[01:12:58.816 --> 01:13:02.319]  Because there's nowhere, no place, they're fed that information.
[01:13:02.699 --> 01:13:06.762]  I wasn't fed it, even in the military and all the military schools that I went to and all the education I had.
[01:13:07.162 --> 01:13:11.685]  I never surfaced any of this thing except through my own independent studies.
[01:13:12.686 --> 01:13:13.667]  The documents were there.
[01:13:13.907 --> 01:13:14.948]  The information is there.
[01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:19.633]  But it's just off the mainstream press.
[01:13:20.334 --> 01:13:27.560]  And there's nobody out there, it's just like you're a guy who wouldn't come on with you today because you've been taking a position that's politically incorrect.
[01:13:28.721 --> 01:13:35.426]  And what is politically incorrect is anything that's been contrary to the program of the Third International.
[01:13:35.466 --> 01:13:38.029]  What's your basis for identifying something that's politically incorrect?
[01:13:38.169 --> 01:13:39.510]  Go to the program of the Third International.
[01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:41.311]  That's the only basis you've really got for it.
[01:13:41.712 --> 01:13:41.992]  And it's 100%.
[01:13:44.893 --> 01:13:45.954]  It is, it's what's happening.
[01:13:46.314 --> 01:13:55.961]  I want to go to some calls here in a few minutes for everybody that's been patiently holding, but General Partin, you talk about where they're up to now, how they admit they're three or four years behind schedule.
[01:13:56.481 --> 01:14:07.048]  You were reading quotes where the Communists said, we will use terrorism to centralize power, to centralize government, so we have levers to take control of, and that's clearly what's happening.
[01:14:07.749 --> 01:14:10.911]  Go back into how they use terrorism, and then I want to talk about
[01:14:11.671 --> 01:14:16.173]  What their program will look like if they get it in place and how far away we are from that.
[01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:19.975]  Let me quote a few more things from Trotsky's book.
[01:14:20.055 --> 01:14:22.356]  Go back and re-quote that about the New World Order for us.
[01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:26.258]  He calls it enemies of the New World Order.
[01:14:26.278 --> 01:14:28.039]  That's just a line.
[01:14:28.259 --> 01:14:30.220]  These are little phrases out of the book.
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:34.261]  He calls it a merciless struggle.
[01:14:36.075 --> 01:14:38.736]  Quote, insolent challenge to the balance of forces.
[01:14:39.396 --> 01:14:45.757]  Therefore, it doesn't make any difference what the balance of power is for military powers in national conflict situations.
[01:14:46.177 --> 01:14:50.038]  They can always take terrorism to the people they want to take it to.
[01:14:51.238 --> 01:14:52.918]  It gives their life a purpose.
[01:14:53.939 --> 01:15:01.100]  It exploits the flabbiness, rottenness, and helplessness of the middle classes and their parties.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.741]  I'd like to make a reference right here to the Abu Ghraib prison over in Iraq.
[01:15:07.566 --> 01:15:16.351]  I don't know anything that is the biggest loss we have ever had over in the Middle East was the exposing and what went on and what was exposed at Abercrombie.
[01:15:17.032 --> 01:15:20.054]  They not only did what they did in harassing prisoners or
[01:15:21.224 --> 01:15:22.005]  Abusing prisoners.
[01:15:22.505 --> 01:15:26.768]  They photographed it, and then they spread those photographs to the world.
[01:15:27.288 --> 01:15:29.590]  Somebody should be hung over that.
[01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:29.950]  Stop.
[01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:45.101]  I agree with you, and it's clear now, it's come out, that there were multiple intelligence agencies in there ordering them to do it with the express purpose of releasing it to make America look like the bad cop, so now the UN can come in and play the part of the good cop.
[01:15:45.521 --> 01:15:45.942]  You bet.
[01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:58.262]  And anybody who has any knowledge of what you do in this sort of intelligence work out there and debriefing prisoners knew the psycho-political aspects of that, that it was done and planned by people who
[01:15:58.757 --> 01:15:58.937]  I don't
[01:16:18.113 --> 01:16:21.197]  Let's go on and talk some of these quotes, some of these other things here.
[01:16:41.275 --> 01:16:49.917]  I know there's a lot you can't get into because of your position, but... It exploits the flabbiness, rottenness, and helplessness of the middle classes and their parties.
[01:16:51.258 --> 01:16:51.898]  Are they helpless?
[01:16:52.258 --> 01:16:59.520]  Are they getting... Is any major political organization out there really addressing the critical issues, exposing these critical things?
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.000]  No, they're not.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:00.780]  They don't talk about it.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:09.262]  Because there's no other way of breaking the class will of the enemy except the systematic and energetic use of violence.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:15.104]  It introduced into the struggle the first degree of savagery.
[01:17:16.005 --> 01:17:19.148]  It kills individuals and intimidates thousands.
[01:17:20.148 --> 01:17:26.714]  Bolsheviks, making use of Red Terror, betray the principles of the sacredness of human life.
[01:17:26.774 --> 01:17:30.838]  Did we see that in Southern Russia just in the last few days?
[01:17:31.559 --> 01:17:31.879]  Checkmate.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:32.720]  Checkmate.
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:48.031]  And by the way, General, I'm sure you're aware mainstream news is having a report that clearly Putin's people are behind this just like he blew up the buildings in 99 and that they left their special forces out the back door and are now going to have a show trial of some patsy.
[01:17:48.491 --> 01:17:48.671]  Yep.
[01:17:49.752 --> 01:17:50.813]  Okay, let's talk about that.
[01:17:51.894 --> 01:17:53.134]  Putin has a past of this.
[01:17:53.194 --> 01:17:55.136]  Can you speak about what you think happened at the school?
[01:18:00.389 --> 01:18:02.950]  I don't know what specifically happened over there.
[01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:07.871]  Anything that I would say would be supposition and I don't care to get into speculation on things like that.
[01:18:08.072 --> 01:18:17.214]  Well, the evidence has now just come out in the last few days that officials, locals, people in the Russian government and the media are saying this was an inside job.
[01:18:19.515 --> 01:18:21.315]  Inside job with respect to Chechnya?
[01:18:21.555 --> 01:18:22.576]  With respect to who?
[01:18:22.856 --> 01:18:27.377]  Inside job as Russian intelligence forces staging the event.
[01:18:29.781 --> 01:18:30.701]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:18:32.962 --> 01:18:34.242]  They do things like that.
[01:18:34.302 --> 01:18:36.183]  The Nazis did things like that.
[01:18:38.123 --> 01:18:39.023]  It's very easy.
[01:18:39.303 --> 01:18:45.045]  Those things are done from the inside to make it look like... That's one way of maneuvering politically.
[01:18:45.825 --> 01:18:47.626]  Just like down in Nicaragua.
[01:18:48.426 --> 01:18:57.328]  There was an inside job down there of the left to get rid of the publisher who was a big leftist down there, Chamorro.
[01:18:58.838 --> 01:19:03.581]  And to launch a lot of things in the revolution down there.
[01:19:03.801 --> 01:19:16.389]  In Colombia, Castro, Del Pino, and one other guy went down and arranged the assassination of the head of the party, left-wing party, liberal party, out of power, and blamed it immediately on the conservative government.
[01:19:16.649 --> 01:19:19.511]  And they started burning and sacking Bogota.
[01:19:20.431 --> 01:19:27.616]  So those guys, they can trigger anything they want to to precipitate a reaction.
[01:19:28.584 --> 01:19:32.205]  And they can do it from inside, they can do it from outside, they can get somebody to do it.
[01:19:32.225 --> 01:19:36.265]  Just like the guy they engaged to do the killing of Dr. Gatton down in Columbia.
[01:19:36.765 --> 01:19:38.726]  They immediately killed the guy they got to kill him.
[01:19:40.126 --> 01:19:42.546]  And drug him around Bogota, behind a vehicle.
[01:19:42.566 --> 01:19:47.227]  You know, you don't hear much about South Africa now.
[01:19:47.907 --> 01:19:50.428]  You don't hear anything about the apartheid in South Africa.
[01:19:51.808 --> 01:19:53.728]  And I remember in this gentleman's article by
[01:19:59.153 --> 01:19:59.693]  Barnett.
[01:20:00.574 --> 01:20:06.777]  They're talking about South Africa now being a viable country down there, and the core values and all this stuff.
[01:20:06.817 --> 01:20:09.459]  But South Africa is now headed by a Communist.
[01:20:10.499 --> 01:20:23.046]  And you know, the War of National Liberation, which is a three-stage thing, you have the long-term preparatory phase, the period of escalating violence, and then in the period of exploitation, you use that country as a base of operation against the next target countries.
[01:20:24.079 --> 01:20:29.203]  Well, when Mandela was freed from jail, that was the beginning of the period of escalating violence.
[01:20:29.323 --> 01:20:32.086]  And it went up to the time he became president.
[01:20:32.686 --> 01:20:40.012]  And in that short period of time, just a few years, there were about 18,000 homicides in South Africa.
[01:20:40.032 --> 01:20:41.654]  Remember when they were having all the necklacing?
[01:20:42.506 --> 01:20:55.738]  Ed Barnett is now calling South Africa the model base for the takeover of Africa, which meshes with somebody else's plan, and you've got a communist in government, and we've got the Pentagon saying commies are good!
[01:20:55.758 --> 01:21:01.303]  Now, but look what has happened since Mandela stepped down.
[01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:02.064]  We've got to break again.
[01:21:02.104 --> 01:21:04.086]  We'll talk about it when we get back, General, and we'll take your call.
[01:21:04.106 --> 01:21:04.506]  Stay with us.
[01:21:07.509 --> 01:21:08.910]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[01:21:09.446 --> 01:21:13.747]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:21:14.147 --> 01:21:15.028]  It still is!
[01:21:15.648 --> 01:21:19.149]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:21:19.469 --> 01:21:21.269]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:21:21.829 --> 01:21:23.890]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:26.451]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:21:26.851 --> 01:21:34.493]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[01:21:34.893 --> 01:21:38.634]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[01:22:26.050 --> 01:22:29.232]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.

[01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:13.410]  You heard that right.
[01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:16.392]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[01:23:16.572 --> 01:23:17.833]  You don't have to pay them off.
[01:23:18.073 --> 01:23:19.474]  The banks are defrauding you.
[01:23:19.754 --> 01:23:21.095]  Now is the time to fight back.
[01:23:21.316 --> 01:23:23.897]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.

[01:24:12.429 --> 01:24:13.870]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.

[01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:33.107]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:24:33.607 --> 01:24:34.728]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:38.969]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:45.872]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.

[01:25:07.639 --> 01:25:12.785]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:25:13.466 --> 01:25:15.749]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:28.514]  Alright, General Parton, again, honored to have you.
[01:25:28.554 --> 01:25:31.735]  You were completing a statement you were making when we hit that last break.
[01:25:32.215 --> 01:25:34.676]  Well, I was making a point about South Africa.
[01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:38.817]  Again, it was played up, you know, as a model for participating in this New World Order.
[01:25:39.417 --> 01:25:45.418]  And I'd indicated earlier, they killed, there were 18,000 homicides during that period of escalating violence.
[01:25:45.478 --> 01:25:50.159]  That's when Mandela was, before he became president and after he got out of jail.
[01:25:51.059 --> 01:25:54.980]  And that was 18,000 over about one, four, five years.
[01:25:57.031 --> 01:26:09.944]  Today, the homicide rate in South Africa is, according to the official police reports in South Africa, is running about 25,000 a year.
[01:26:11.686 --> 01:26:15.110]  But the Interpol, the French group, says that the
[01:26:15.774 --> 01:26:20.217]  Homicide level rate in South Africa today is about 50,000 a year.
[01:26:20.477 --> 01:26:22.999]  And by the way, most of that is racially motivated.
[01:26:23.019 --> 01:26:25.800]  It's whites, but now the media doesn't talk about it.
[01:26:26.041 --> 01:26:32.244]  Well, it's not mostly... Most of the people back there before it was black-on-black violence.
[01:26:32.625 --> 01:26:36.527]  All I've read is that attacks on whites, racially motivated, have escalated.
[01:26:37.248 --> 01:26:39.229]  Well, that's right.
[01:26:39.809 --> 01:26:42.371]  But the numbers of people involved here
[01:26:43.261 --> 01:26:48.083]  You know, Brutal AZ was head of a big hunk of that country and he was promising they would have a separate state.
[01:26:49.123 --> 01:26:52.484]  But they reneged on that and nothing was done about it.
[01:26:52.544 --> 01:26:56.245]  So, many of those people who are being killed, most of them are black.
[01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:57.305]  The large majority.
[01:26:57.325 --> 01:26:58.886]  Yeah, it's horrible what's happening.
[01:26:59.426 --> 01:27:02.087]  So they get control, then they escalate violence.
[01:27:02.587 --> 01:27:02.967]  That's right.
[01:27:03.487 --> 01:27:03.867]  That's right.
[01:27:03.907 --> 01:27:08.369]  It's going far higher than, it is going up much steeper than many countries in the world.
[01:27:09.109 --> 01:27:11.009]  The killing is accelerating a lot.
[01:27:11.210 --> 01:27:12.650]  I have sort of a generic charge.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.749]  A chart that shows the level of violence as a function of the stages of the war of national liberation.
[01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:22.254]  And for South Africa, they're well off the chart.
[01:27:23.276 --> 01:27:26.461]  So how can the Pentagon be saying that this is a model country?
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.661]  Well, is the Pentagon saying that, or is this guy who wrote this report?
[01:27:31.941 --> 01:27:34.102]  Well, I know Barnett is, but a lot of others are saying that.
[01:27:34.122 --> 01:27:39.404]  I mean, this map is what's being pushed by a lot of the top brass and people in government.
[01:27:39.744 --> 01:27:44.826]  Well, they've been pushing this expeditionary warfare for a long time.
[01:27:46.147 --> 01:27:53.890]  And with the precision-guided weapons and the capabilities you have, you can do a lot of things differently than you used to.
[01:27:54.594 --> 01:27:57.356]  My gosh, I think we had the 7th Air Force over in Vietnam.
[01:27:57.436 --> 01:28:04.040]  If you had a couple of A-10s with that kind of capability, you could probably kill more trucks on the Ho Chi Minh Trail than the whole 7th Air Force.
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:08.302]  There's been a big revolution in air power with precision-guided weapons.
[01:28:09.803 --> 01:28:14.405]  So looking at the Pentagon's new map, you know, these zones, China, Russia, aren't in it.
[01:28:14.446 --> 01:28:22.050]  They're our friends now, and a lot of these so-called countries that are in the map to be attacked are just countries that aren't part of the New World Order.
[01:28:24.577 --> 01:28:24.797]  Yet.
[01:28:28.558 --> 01:28:33.999]  Or some of them are not conforming as some of the powers that be want them to conform.
[01:28:34.019 --> 01:28:37.940]  But don't let anybody kid you.
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:47.422]  The control of money, a global Fed and a global bank, which in its cursory stages is really the World Bank and the IMF.
[01:28:50.596 --> 01:29:04.265]  Well, we're now going into the free trade area of the Americas, and they're even talking about making Miami or Atlanta the capital, openly merging our social security with the entire hemisphere, our governments, our police, and the average American, General Parton, has no idea that's happening!
[01:29:04.485 --> 01:29:04.965]  That's right.
[01:29:05.605 --> 01:29:07.687]  Let me just make another little step about Africa.
[01:29:07.847 --> 01:29:10.248]  You remember Gaddafi in Libya?
[01:29:10.809 --> 01:29:15.912]  Did take some major steps recently, disarmed himself of all his weapons of mass destruction?
[01:29:15.972 --> 01:29:16.232]  Yes.
[01:29:16.492 --> 01:29:16.832]  Remember?
[01:29:16.932 --> 01:29:17.633]  Why'd he do that?
[01:29:19.099 --> 01:29:25.966]  He hopes to become... they're working on establishing the same kind of an African Union like the European Union.
[01:29:25.986 --> 01:29:26.707]  Yeah, he said that.
[01:29:26.747 --> 01:29:27.788]  He wants to be their boy.
[01:29:27.808 --> 01:29:29.430]  He wants to become their president.
[01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:31.252]  And now they're telling us Qaddafi's good.
[01:29:31.272 --> 01:29:31.732]  Yeah.
[01:29:33.274 --> 01:29:34.695]  But that's the reason.
[01:29:34.755 --> 01:29:38.038]  It wasn't to be a good guy and get rid of this weapons of mass destruction.
[01:29:38.078 --> 01:29:41.962]  He's playing for greater stakes as head of the
[01:29:45.786 --> 01:29:47.909]  I think that's being ignored.
[01:29:47.929 --> 01:29:50.372]  I think the globalists are moving to make South Africa the capital.
[01:29:52.414 --> 01:29:52.654]  Never.
[01:29:54.256 --> 01:29:56.819]  No, they will not do that.
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:59.683]  I guarantee you they will not make South Africa the capital.
[01:29:59.703 --> 01:30:01.325]  So you think they'll make the capital Libya then?
[01:30:03.392 --> 01:30:05.253]  Most probably it will be in the Muslim world.
[01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:26.333]  What will life be like underneath the New World Order if they get the whole program through?
[01:30:26.353 --> 01:30:29.595]  I mean, if they had their way, what would this planet look like?
[01:30:29.655 --> 01:30:31.296]  That's the question we get back from break.
[01:30:31.896 --> 01:30:35.198]  I say a prison planet of complete enslavement and dehumanization.
[01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:37.832]  A 1984 world.
[01:30:37.912 --> 01:30:41.715]  We'll get General Partin's take on that and then go straight to your calls.
[01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:49.202]  On the other side of this quick break, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, or just some of the websites.

[01:32:10.916 --> 01:32:20.085]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:32:20.405 --> 01:32:25.070]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:32:25.530 --> 01:32:32.255]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:32:32.656 --> 01:32:44.445]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:32:44.905 --> 01:32:49.367]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:32:49.527 --> 01:32:51.868]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:32:56.611 --> 01:32:57.671]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:33:07.685 --> 01:33:09.166]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:33:09.366 --> 01:33:16.712]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:33:17.012 --> 01:33:21.435]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:33:21.695 --> 01:33:31.543]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:33:32.284 --> 01:33:35.968]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:33:36.288 --> 01:33:38.791]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:33:39.091 --> 01:33:45.018]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:33:45.258 --> 01:33:46.800]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:47.961]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:33:48.041 --> 01:33:51.043]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:33:51.203 --> 01:33:54.365]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:33:54.605 --> 01:33:57.027]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:33:57.827 --> 01:34:01.870]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.931]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:34:13.859 --> 01:34:16.340]  All right, we're back live, my friends.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.181]  We've been all over the map talking about the globalist program.
[01:34:19.201 --> 01:34:26.864]  You can call it the communist program because that's where it came from, but it's clearly funded by the big criminal banks that are not free market and want you to be their slaves.
[01:34:27.524 --> 01:34:29.145]  We're talking to General Benton K. Parton.
[01:34:30.065 --> 01:34:34.527]  General, what will this program look like if it succeeds?
[01:34:35.287 --> 01:34:39.849]  If they got their way globally, what would life be like under it, and what's the time frame?
[01:34:40.889 --> 01:34:42.050]  It's totalitarianism.
[01:34:43.235 --> 01:34:44.496]  What's totalitarianism?
[01:34:44.796 --> 01:34:47.438]  You have no freedoms except what somebody gives you.
[01:34:48.679 --> 01:34:49.639]  And what's the time frame?
[01:34:49.659 --> 01:34:54.762]  You know, I think this is one thing that discourages a lot of people who think everything's going to happen tomorrow, and it isn't.
[01:34:55.363 --> 01:35:11.493]  If you look at the things that I spelled out back there, the sequence of things that still have to go, from this world commonwealth of independent states, to this globalism, interdependence, the withering away of the state, and regional governments, to this ultimate, what they call, new world order, this world without nations, nationalities, and borders,
[01:35:12.219 --> 01:35:21.401]  But, you know, the United States is sitting primed and cocked right now to have a major expansion of the terrorist effort in this country.
[01:35:22.261 --> 01:35:33.183]  You have the presidential directives back there going back to Nixon, I guess, to break down this country and to regional governments bypassing the state, which sort of conforms with that last stage of things.
[01:35:33.283 --> 01:35:36.064]  Remember, this global hierarchy of regional governments.
[01:35:36.224 --> 01:35:40.685]  By the way, Putin's going to the same color coding and going to the same 10 regional governors.
[01:35:41.731 --> 01:35:56.231]  Yeah, but they can talk about it and do all kinds of things out there to make it sound wonderful and convert to just get you and the people to accept
[01:35:56.997 --> 01:36:02.560]  What they're moving toward in the New World Order.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:12.806]  How can Mr. Barnett get up on C-SPAN in front of the Pentagon's brass and say, the Pentagon's wrong, some of you still won't listen, China's our friend, they're not a threat.
[01:36:13.106 --> 01:36:17.488]  I mean, how, when they're threatening to nuke us on a monthly basis, how can he get away with that?
[01:36:17.728 --> 01:36:19.409]  Well, why does he get invited over there?
[01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:23.051]  Why did he get invited?
[01:36:23.091 --> 01:36:24.272]  Let me ask you another question.
[01:36:25.276 --> 01:36:27.117]  I'll respond to your question with another question.
[01:36:27.857 --> 01:36:44.385]  For the last several years, you've had the head of the House Armed Services Committee, Porter Goss, head of the House, not the Armed Services Committee, but the House Intelligence Committee, sitting in the catbird seat to oversee the intelligence organization in this country.
[01:36:45.285 --> 01:36:54.069]  If there's anybody out there who has been in a position to force a reform in the bad things in the intelligence community, it's that guy.
[01:36:54.702 --> 01:36:58.484]  Now he's being put up and recommended to be the new chief of the CIA.
[01:36:59.904 --> 01:37:02.706]  Because he did a good job keeping the bad system in place?
[01:37:03.406 --> 01:37:14.511]  I don't know, but I say if anybody was sitting in a position to reform things and solve the problems, he was over the last several years in that position as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:37:15.091 --> 01:37:16.132]  Alright, let's go to calls.
[01:37:17.732 --> 01:37:19.053]  Let's talk to Dan and Matt.
[01:37:19.073 --> 01:37:20.974]  You're on the air, thank you for holding patiently.
[01:37:20.994 --> 01:37:22.975]  Hi again, I just called yesterday.
[01:37:24.142 --> 01:37:25.682]  I salute you General Partin.
[01:37:26.383 --> 01:37:31.944]  I'm really happy for what you're doing and I wish there were more like you out there.
[01:37:32.204 --> 01:37:38.305]  Military, ex-military people that were willing to risk quite a bit to get the truth out.
[01:37:38.445 --> 01:37:39.185]  I think it's great.
[01:37:39.765 --> 01:37:40.966]  I think you're an American hero.
[01:37:42.126 --> 01:37:46.367]  Alex, I was wondering if you could give me about four minutes to recite
[01:37:46.997 --> 01:37:49.719]  Patrick Henry's speech, give me liberty, give me death.
[01:37:49.739 --> 01:37:50.980]  You know, I've read that on air before.
[01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:52.101]  We don't have four minutes.
[01:37:52.141 --> 01:37:53.663]  You want to read the last two paragraphs?
[01:37:54.043 --> 01:37:54.583]  Oh, sure.
[01:37:54.623 --> 01:37:56.045]  The whole thing's really good.
[01:37:56.125 --> 01:37:57.266]  It's really pertinent.
[01:37:57.446 --> 01:37:58.587]  Yeah, I know it is.
[01:37:58.667 --> 01:38:00.528]  Okay, I'm going to... Could I do that then?
[01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:02.870]  The last two paragraphs.
[01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:03.391]  I will do that.
[01:38:03.471 --> 01:38:04.051]  Thank you, sir.
[01:38:04.472 --> 01:38:05.673]  Okay.
[01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:12.018]  They tell us, sir, that we are weak, unable to cope with so formidable an adversary.
[01:38:12.599 --> 01:38:14.180]  But when shall we be stronger?
[01:38:14.827 --> 01:38:17.308]  Will it be the next week or the next year?
[01:38:17.848 --> 01:38:19.809]  Will it be when we are totally disarmed?
[01:38:20.549 --> 01:38:23.350]  And when a British Guard shall be stationed in every house?
[01:38:24.011 --> 01:38:28.192]  Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction?
[01:38:28.913 --> 01:38:39.657]  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?
[01:38:40.377 --> 01:38:44.459]  Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those
[01:38:44.963 --> 01:38:46.624]  The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone.
[01:39:13.078 --> 01:39:15.278]  It is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.
[01:39:15.738 --> 01:39:17.899]  Besides, sir, we have no election.
[01:39:18.299 --> 01:39:22.980]  If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:26.120]  There is no retreat but in submission into slavery.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.801]  Our chains are forged.
[01:39:28.261 --> 01:39:31.001]  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston.
[01:39:31.441 --> 01:39:33.381]  The war is inevitable and let it come.
[01:39:33.501 --> 01:39:34.762]  I repeat, sir, let it come.
[01:39:35.142 --> 01:39:37.282]  It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.
[01:39:37.642 --> 01:39:40.503]  Gentlemen may cry, peace, peace, but there is no peace.
[01:39:40.843 --> 01:39:42.183]  The war has actually begun.
[01:39:42.645 --> 01:39:47.487]  The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms.
[01:39:47.868 --> 01:39:49.548]  Our brethren are already in the field.
[01:39:49.969 --> 01:39:51.349]  Why stand here idle?
[01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:53.490]  What is it that gentlemen wish?
[01:39:54.011 --> 01:39:54.851]  What would they have?
[01:39:55.330 --> 01:40:00.553]  Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?
[01:40:00.873 --> 01:40:02.233]  Forbid it, Almighty God!
[01:40:02.593 --> 01:40:07.436]  I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:40:07.536 --> 01:40:08.156]  Okay, thank you.
[01:40:08.196 --> 01:40:09.737]  We've got to be fair to the other callers.
[01:40:10.817 --> 01:40:12.618]  We're going to go to other callers here in a second.
[01:40:12.738 --> 01:40:16.020]  I would just add to that that if they take over, if they set up the police state,
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:19.183]  Well, you know, Waco and Ruby Ridge generated the militia movement in this country.
[01:40:39.264 --> 01:40:54.435]  And in the bombing of Oklahoma, it destroyed the organized effort and the militia out there for the simple reason when they bombed Oklahoma, they had McVeigh as a patsy in the operation and he was labeled as a militia guy, which he never was.
[01:40:55.396 --> 01:40:58.398]  And so that really disbanded the militia crowd out there.
[01:40:59.839 --> 01:41:04.703]  So, you've got to win this fight in the political process.
[01:41:05.865 --> 01:41:07.106]  It's just like the Minutemen.
[01:41:07.726 --> 01:41:10.748]  Their operations, they were fighting after they had already lost.
[01:41:11.328 --> 01:41:13.129]  Way back there, 30, 40 years ago.
[01:41:13.149 --> 01:41:14.090]  Now that's it.
[01:41:14.190 --> 01:41:21.474]  You've got to win in the political process, and the American people can do it now, but they have to take back the political process at the grassroots.
[01:41:21.794 --> 01:41:22.995]  Not at the top, at the grassroots.
[01:41:23.255 --> 01:41:24.896]  Then you can determine what the top is.
[01:41:24.916 --> 01:41:26.277]  We've got to create our force.
[01:41:27.157 --> 01:41:37.942]  In the local area, with the indigenous population, so if we do lose this battle, and if they do capture us, then we have to move into the Minuteman scenario.
[01:41:38.482 --> 01:41:40.503]  Well, if you do it right, you will never have to.
[01:41:40.923 --> 01:41:41.443]  Exactly.
[01:41:42.184 --> 01:41:47.886]  Let's go ahead, and we're trying to avert that, folks, but if it does happen, we're going to win, and we're not going to stop, and everybody knows that.
[01:41:48.186 --> 01:41:49.627]  And you know that too, Gloveless, don't you?
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:52.242]  That's why you want our guns so bad, you pieces of filth.
[01:41:52.682 --> 01:41:56.084]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Illinois.
[01:41:56.124 --> 01:41:56.745]  Dave, go ahead.
[01:41:56.765 --> 01:41:59.147]  Hi, General Martin.
[01:41:59.247 --> 01:42:01.909]  Thanks for your ongoing service to the country, and yours too, Alex.
[01:42:02.449 --> 01:42:04.851]  I just want to make a quick statement.
[01:42:05.351 --> 01:42:15.899]  You know, I wish they'd use the big ol' microwave oven protester cookers, the active denial system, to maybe try and detonate some of those improvised explosive devices in Iraq.
[01:42:15.939 --> 01:42:18.261]  You know, save the poor commutant soldiers
[01:42:19.065 --> 01:42:21.686]  You know, but they probably won't do that because they want their martyrs.
[01:42:22.206 --> 01:42:28.108]  But, you know, I see Abu Ghraib just going to stir up Iran.
[01:42:31.308 --> 01:42:32.369]  All kinds of things like that.
[01:42:32.389 --> 01:42:36.890]  Talking about Africa, I see that as social engineering, you know.
[01:42:37.814 --> 01:42:49.040]  Uh, in the Sudan, they've already got money in the Department of Defense allocated for the Sudan, you know, and they're just dragging their heels, you know, so they can get their genocide going, so they can come in as the big hero.
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:59.286]  And, um, my only question to the General would be, um, do you see anything, uh, related to the compassionate communism they're trying to bring in with the...
[01:43:02.811 --> 01:43:06.314]  The United States Joint Forces Command... Let me stop you right there.
[01:43:06.354 --> 01:43:08.275]  Those are a lot of questions, a lot of good points.
[01:43:08.696 --> 01:43:12.018]  Bush calls himself, in his campaign in 2000, a communitarian.
[01:43:12.739 --> 01:43:16.802]  Fifteen-year-old dictionary said, one who believes in communist systems of government.
[01:43:17.222 --> 01:43:18.103]  Now it doesn't say that.
[01:43:18.123 --> 01:43:19.584]  It's just one that believes in community.
[01:43:20.084 --> 01:43:21.125]  Can you comment on that?
[01:43:21.185 --> 01:43:24.508]  I think that's where he was going with the compassionate communism thing.
[01:43:24.828 --> 01:43:27.250]  Well, I have a definition that I use.
[01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:30.152]  It came out of the dictionary back in the fifties and sixties.
[01:43:30.832 --> 01:43:31.493]  And it says,
[01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:38.034]  In 12 words, communitarian is one who believes in or is a member of a communist society.
[01:43:38.875 --> 01:43:42.396]  And this is changing the meaning of words.
[01:43:42.476 --> 01:43:50.519]  The new definition in Webster's is still 12 words, but it just calls it a partially... I had the thing in front of me.
[01:43:50.579 --> 01:43:51.059]  I'll go on.
[01:43:51.119 --> 01:43:51.800]  It's disappeared.
[01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:53.920]  But you can go to your present dictionary and look it up.
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:57.322]  It doesn't say anything like the dictionary 20 or 30 years ago.
[01:43:58.530 --> 01:44:02.334]  Let me make another point quickly, a point you ought to make every time you have an opportunity.
[01:44:03.155 --> 01:44:09.461]  This business of just church and state separation, you don't hear anybody...
[01:44:13.374 --> 01:44:18.057]  The separation of church and state is in all three of the Soviet Union constitutions.
[01:44:18.578 --> 01:44:29.706]  All three of them call for the separation of church and state, the separation of church and school, and the right of all citizens and the government to conduct anti-religious propaganda.
[01:44:30.406 --> 01:44:32.668]  That's where separation of church and state comes from.
[01:44:32.808 --> 01:44:42.855]  And to explain it, the First Amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and then the press and assembly and all that.
[01:44:43.604 --> 01:44:51.149]  So the government isn't supposed to be involved in religion, not that we're not supposed to be free to be involved in the government with our religion?
[01:44:51.649 --> 01:45:05.379]  Well, they want to establish an atheistic world out there, and they're trying to use that phony thing which came out of the Sobey Constitution and interpret it in our American Constitution as containing that, and it isn't at all.
[01:45:05.699 --> 01:45:08.001]  Okay, next up, Mike in Arizona.
[01:45:08.041 --> 01:45:08.921]  You're on the air, Mike.
[01:45:08.961 --> 01:45:09.381]  Go ahead.
[01:45:09.401 --> 01:45:10.022]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:11.710 --> 01:45:13.271]  Hi Alex, General Parton.
[01:45:13.612 --> 01:45:14.372]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:15.313 --> 01:45:30.565]  General, as Alex mentioned earlier, we know that Jacob Schiff, when he worked for Kuhn Low, basically acting as a front man for the Rothschilds, probably, to finance the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.
[01:45:34.288 --> 01:45:36.430]  Who is financing this movement today?
[01:45:40.916 --> 01:45:44.038]  The big financeers and what's going on today.
[01:45:44.058 --> 01:45:48.161]  Drug trade is one of the big sources.
[01:45:50.964 --> 01:45:53.125]  Criminalism is another big source.
[01:45:53.245 --> 01:45:54.946]  Just plain organized crime out there.
[01:45:55.567 --> 01:46:04.934]  The communist world moved to take over and train people in Western Eastern Europe many years ago to either go out and liquidate or take over all the
[01:46:05.855 --> 01:46:07.476]  Mafia organizations in the world.
[01:46:07.516 --> 01:46:16.119]  Yeah, the New World Order is a society of organized criminals working for a world government to cage us and feed on us at their leisure.
[01:46:16.839 --> 01:46:20.180]  Is it fair to say that this is headquartered in the city of London?
[01:46:23.261 --> 01:46:23.582]  No, is it?
[01:46:23.662 --> 01:46:30.244]  Hey, let me just ask you, where is the headquarters of Christianity in the world today?
[01:46:31.608 --> 01:46:32.469]  I don't think there is one.
[01:46:34.051 --> 01:46:35.892]  But they're all working on that same book, aren't they?
[01:46:37.294 --> 01:46:38.014]  Well, presumably.
[01:46:38.074 --> 01:46:39.916]  Presumably, to a major extent.
[01:46:39.976 --> 01:46:43.640]  Just like everybody in the comedy world is operating off the 28th program, still today.
[01:46:44.301 --> 01:46:47.644]  So it's very distributed then.
[01:46:48.104 --> 01:46:51.347]  Sure, it's distributed, but yet it has its masters on it.
[01:46:51.367 --> 01:46:52.868]  Well, it's almost become reflex.
[01:46:52.888 --> 01:47:02.216]  Then it gets put under other names and other policies and other think tanks and other movements, but it's all the same handbook, basically plagiarized under other names.
[01:47:02.336 --> 01:47:11.223]  Just like Marion Barry here is the mayor of Washington for a long time, and he just won in his district, so apparently he's going to be back on the board in the District of Washington.
[01:47:11.823 --> 01:47:25.849]  But he changed his middle name from Myron S. Berry many, many years ago when he was trying to be a street revolutionary to Myron S. Berry, and S was for Chalepin, and Chalepin at the time was the chief theoretician of the Communist Party in Russia.
[01:47:26.489 --> 01:47:27.389]  General, one last question.
[01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:32.471]  Have you written anything recently or are you planning anything to kind of help wake up the public?
[01:47:34.226 --> 01:47:37.469]  I've been doing a lot of talk shows on this subject, and I am working on some things too.
[01:47:37.489 --> 01:47:46.177]  Well, General Parton, I would like to invite you to write a 10 page, 50 page report, 100 page if you want, 500 if you want, and we'll post it on InfoWars.com.
[01:47:46.217 --> 01:47:47.979]  We have millions of readers, conservatively.
[01:47:48.379 --> 01:47:49.120]  I'll try to do that.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:51.062]  Alright, appreciate it.
[01:47:51.102 --> 01:47:54.285]  Let me make one quick comment about when we went into Iraq.
[01:47:55.145 --> 01:47:59.029]  I was attending a fairly large group here in Washington trying to save the U.S.
[01:47:59.069 --> 01:47:59.589]  Patent Office.
[01:48:00.837 --> 01:48:05.058]  And I made the comment to that group the day we marched into Iraq.
[01:48:05.998 --> 01:48:09.519]  And I said, look at the press downstream.
[01:48:09.959 --> 01:48:14.159]  I'm predicting right now that we are stepping into a trap.
[01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:16.580]  And I say this for one reason.
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:23.741]  At that time, you had Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, and Egypt.
[01:48:24.861 --> 01:48:27.622]  All countries surrounding where you were going.
[01:48:29.184 --> 01:48:31.405]  And every one of them was Soviet client states.
[01:48:31.945 --> 01:48:33.966]  Every one of them.
[01:48:33.986 --> 01:48:38.428]  Egypt was the first country to transition by what the communist world calls a block-within strategy.
[01:48:38.688 --> 01:48:41.869]  Remember they had King Farouk on the throne, they got rid of him, put in Nasser.
[01:48:42.349 --> 01:48:44.750]  That process was called the block-within strategy.
[01:48:44.770 --> 01:48:52.773]  And the communist world adopted that, and the party congress in 1960 to be applied everywhere that strategy fit.
[01:48:53.153 --> 01:48:55.914]  And it has been applied to many countries since.
[01:48:56.194 --> 01:48:57.555]  How does Israel play into this?
[01:48:59.246 --> 01:49:00.426]  You got another hour or two?
[01:49:03.307 --> 01:49:12.789]  Look, there isn't a country out there that doesn't have some involvement in this, that doesn't have some penetration in this, or organization in people who organized it.
[01:49:12.829 --> 01:49:15.409]  Look, they've been going for 75 years?
[01:49:16.890 --> 01:49:17.990]  Longer than that, really.
[01:49:19.130 --> 01:49:22.031]  But all of those countries surrounding Iraq,
[01:49:23.348 --> 01:49:24.109]  or client state.
[01:49:24.489 --> 01:49:27.311]  Egypt was the first one to go by the block within strategy.
[01:49:27.431 --> 01:49:30.693]  Iraq was the second one to go by block within strategy.
[01:49:31.093 --> 01:49:36.136]  And Iraq was a secular country headed by, but it was still a dictatorship.
[01:49:36.156 --> 01:49:36.977]  Let's take another call.
[01:49:37.017 --> 01:49:40.999]  Let's talk to Ian in Canada.
[01:49:41.019 --> 01:49:42.360]  You're on the air with General Parton.
[01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:42.880]  Go ahead.
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:45.242]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:49:45.822 --> 01:49:49.745]  General Parton, those quotes from Trotsky could have come out of Mein Kampf.
[01:49:50.265 --> 01:49:51.726]  But aside from that,
[01:49:52.650 --> 01:49:54.071]  There are three things that concern me.
[01:49:54.191 --> 01:49:59.714]  Number one, a couple of weeks ago, the Iranian Defense Minister described the forces of the U.S.
[01:49:59.854 --> 01:50:03.636]  in the Middle East, and Iraq specifically, as hostages of the Iranians.
[01:50:04.716 --> 01:50:14.962]  Secondly, you've got a staged conflict being created right now between the Georgian Republic and the Russian Republic, which is consistent with the Soviet global war doctrine.
[01:50:15.382 --> 01:50:17.103]  And you've got a program of
[01:50:17.819 --> 01:50:28.742]  Domestic terrorism in the Soviet Union, or Russia, the Russian Republic right now, being run by the internal security network, theoretically, and Alex believes that's the case.
[01:50:29.582 --> 01:50:42.526]  Stanislav Dunyav, one of the highest ranking intelligence officers from the Soviet Union, warned in his book, In the Eye of the Enemy, that this is precisely what we would see preliminary to a comprehensive
[01:50:43.965 --> 01:50:49.367]  Chinese-Russian strategic attack on the West, of course targeted on the continental U.S.
[01:50:50.528 --> 01:50:52.829]  Could it be more imminent than we think?
[01:50:53.229 --> 01:50:57.071]  I believe they're going to use sandbags and use the political and the terror angle, General.
[01:50:57.351 --> 01:51:00.912]  The communist world has always moved very conservatively.
[01:51:01.813 --> 01:51:05.234]  How many times have you seen them really fail and fall flat on their face?
[01:51:05.274 --> 01:51:05.994]  Not too often.
[01:51:06.555 --> 01:51:07.955]  They move very conservatively.
[01:51:07.975 --> 01:51:09.556]  They feel very, very sure and confident.
[01:51:10.086 --> 01:51:12.807]  Let me make a comparison to the United States.
[01:51:12.827 --> 01:51:13.727]  Let me stop you real quick.
[01:51:13.747 --> 01:51:18.168]  Don't they only fail when a general like MacArthur refuses orders and does what he wants?
[01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:22.670]  They've succeeded, man, eventually.
[01:51:22.690 --> 01:51:23.730]  Well, they only got half of it.
[01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:25.190]  Go ahead, General.
[01:51:25.230 --> 01:51:25.831]  Yeah, they didn't.
[01:51:27.171 --> 01:51:37.274]  Chow and Lai in China, when we were moving into, I guess, into Korea, said, we welcome the United States into Southeast Asia.
[01:51:39.389 --> 01:51:44.332]  We will get them in and we will keep them forever and we will cut off their fingers one at a time.
[01:51:45.133 --> 01:51:50.196]  We've been there over 50 years now.
[01:51:50.376 --> 01:51:56.781]  These things have long-term strategic purposes, long-term strategic interests.
[01:51:57.581 --> 01:52:01.083]  So we have had roots tied down in Korea all this time.
[01:52:01.163 --> 01:52:02.084]  Nothing was resolved.
[01:52:02.284 --> 01:52:02.925]  We got a break.
[01:52:02.965 --> 01:52:04.706]  According to Mr. Barnett, they're our friends.
[01:52:07.276 --> 01:52:11.639]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:52:11.819 --> 01:52:16.241]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:16.381 --> 01:52:20.744]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:52:20.784 --> 01:52:22.145]  The New World Order.
[01:52:22.945 --> 01:52:23.906]  Hammered.
[01:52:23.947 --> 01:52:28.171]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:52:28.211 --> 01:52:35.179]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:52:35.279 --> 01:52:37.302]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:37.682 --> 01:52:48.106]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:52:48.286 --> 01:52:53.668]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:54:52.259 --> 01:54:55.341]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:54:55.521 --> 01:55:01.444]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:55:11.028 --> 01:55:12.109]  Folks, in a nutshell,
[01:55:13.124 --> 01:55:21.188]  The organized crime syndicates, the central banks, over a hundred years ago financed a system to con serfs back into feudalism.
[01:55:21.848 --> 01:55:27.651]  And so while our government actually propped up communism, it would also build up its own police state in the name of countering it.
[01:55:28.551 --> 01:55:32.553]  Now they've shifted to the next phase of merging our governments and our militaries together.
[01:55:33.846 --> 01:55:36.127]  And all these leftists out there can't figure that out.
[01:55:36.167 --> 01:55:41.670]  They think they're fighting the big banks and fighting the evil rich men with the black top hats, you know, as they jokingly say.
[01:55:41.951 --> 01:55:43.491]  But in truth, they work for them.
[01:55:43.892 --> 01:55:46.373]  Because those guys are criminals and aren't for a free market.
[01:55:47.051 --> 01:55:49.412]  Well, if you accept the idea that communism is dead,
[01:56:17.530 --> 01:56:17.931]  Why not?
[01:56:18.651 --> 01:56:25.438]  It's a good idea that the Soviet Union is now a peaceful country with no objectives.
[01:56:26.559 --> 01:56:26.919]  Why not?
[01:56:28.941 --> 01:56:36.348]  But how did our police and FBI military go this far that they're openly learning all the horrible tactics of the communist Russians?
[01:56:36.888 --> 01:56:38.950]  Well, there are a lot of good people in the FBI.
[01:56:40.583 --> 01:56:44.446]  But, uh, they have the same problem you have in other organizations in government.
[01:56:44.506 --> 01:56:48.409]  If you don't stay politically correct in what you're saying, you don't go anywhere.
[01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.590]  You don't get up.
[01:56:50.431 --> 01:56:53.133]  And, uh, there are a lot of good people in the government.
[01:56:53.153 --> 01:56:59.318]  I remember my wife picked me up at the Pentagon one Saturday night, after midnight, and she was sitting there in the car looking at it.
[01:56:59.338 --> 01:57:03.140]  I walked up to the car and said, there's a light here and another light over there.
[01:57:03.201 --> 01:57:07.544]  And she said, you know, I bet there's not a single light on in any of those rooms.
[01:57:07.584 --> 01:57:08.865]  There's somebody up there isn't.
[01:57:09.529 --> 01:57:13.632]  Really on our side, or their side, fighting, working overtime.
[01:57:15.313 --> 01:57:18.015]  I'm not sure what she was right about that.
[01:57:18.796 --> 01:57:22.178]  Well, yeah, they got people like Barnett in there chastising the military.
[01:57:22.219 --> 01:57:23.560]  You guys haven't got it!
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:25.201]  China's our friend!
[01:57:25.261 --> 01:57:26.442]  Russia's our friend!
[01:57:26.742 --> 01:57:27.863]  You haven't got it!
[01:57:29.464 --> 01:57:32.186]  You know, I remember back in the time of Sputnik.
[01:57:33.367 --> 01:57:37.570]  I was in the ballistic research laboratory at the time, and they had this little small
[01:57:38.444 --> 01:57:39.665]  We're good to go.
[01:57:56.992 --> 01:58:04.278]  Maxwell Taylor called in and said, I'm holding you personally responsible to assure that the third stage on that device is inactive.
[01:58:04.378 --> 01:58:08.261]  We can't support, we can't scoop the Vanguard program.
[01:58:09.306 --> 01:58:14.309]  And the Russians went ahead and put Sputnik up 18 months ahead of the United States.
[01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:17.411]  And our government always caught arming them with the latest technologies.
[01:58:17.792 --> 01:58:18.732]  Robert in Illinois.
[01:58:19.272 --> 01:58:20.093]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:58:20.193 --> 01:58:20.813]  Go ahead.
[01:58:20.833 --> 01:58:21.514]  Good to be back on.
[01:58:21.534 --> 01:58:27.097]  I want to thank you and General Parton, just like the other callers did, because without you I think we'd already be in the FEMA detention centers.
[01:58:27.117 --> 01:58:27.978]  A couple quick things.
[01:58:28.378 --> 01:58:33.402]  When I lead people to your website, I just plant seeds and I ask rhetorical questions, Socratic method.
[01:58:33.442 --> 01:58:37.204]  I get them finding the conflicts and, you know, let the media present to them and so forth.
[01:58:37.495 --> 01:58:41.322]  And then I afterwards, over a daily, weekly basis, I ask them for feedback.
[01:58:41.724 --> 01:58:45.325]  To try to get a sense of what they're walking away with out of your website.
[01:58:45.666 --> 01:58:47.586]  And I wanted to make a suggestion for whatever it's worth.
[01:58:47.887 --> 01:58:50.528]  You talk about the gun control works, the mass murders, I'll agree.
[01:58:50.968 --> 01:58:58.311]  If you could bring in the Rothschilds and a greater emphasis on the Rothschilds, like where you have the pictures of Stalin, Hitler, and Mao.
[01:58:58.591 --> 01:59:11.336]  If you could bring in that the Rothschilds have been at the top of it all, on the basic approach that when one puts together a puzzle that's a thousand pieces, it's easier generally if you can get all the outside pieces that have a straight edge or a square edge
[01:59:11.696 --> 01:59:15.679]  If they can see that the Rothschilds are at the top, that can clear up a lot of the confusion.
[01:59:15.699 --> 01:59:17.240]  Okay, we're out of time.
[01:59:17.461 --> 01:59:18.101]  Thanks for the call.
[01:59:18.141 --> 01:59:19.902]  Sorry to all the other people that tried to call.
[01:59:20.303 --> 01:59:21.524]  Be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[01:59:21.564 --> 01:59:22.865]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 central.
[01:59:23.205 --> 01:59:25.206]  General Parton, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:59:25.226 --> 01:59:26.147]  Any closing comments?
[01:59:26.267 --> 01:59:27.308]  Tomorrow, my pleasure.
[01:59:27.368 --> 01:59:30.951]  Next time you have this gentleman on, I'd be happy to debate him.
[01:59:32.097 --> 01:59:36.020]  Well, I'd like to have Mr. Barnett on to debate us, but he's very upset when I talk to him.
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:37.821]  I wonder why he's so upset, General.
[01:59:38.482 --> 01:59:47.208]  Well, let me encourage all your listeners out there that they have to get involved in the political process at the grassroots level and take this country back.
[01:59:47.728 --> 01:59:50.931]  You can't take the top back until you take the bottom down back.
[01:59:51.191 --> 01:59:51.691]  Exactly.
[01:59:52.232 --> 01:59:53.072]  Alright, take care.
[01:59:53.112 --> 01:59:54.073]  God bless you all.
[01:59:54.113 --> 01:59:55.414]  Defeat the New World Order!
