[00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:06.222]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:07.922]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:09.743]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.403 --> 00:00:11.263]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:13.504]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:17.505]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:21.866]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:32.829]  Up in New York City and other areas around the country, they've been caught testing
[00:00:35.046 --> 00:00:39.269]  Dangerous experimental drugs on the foster children they've kidnapped.
[00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.072]  Well, now they're testing pesticides on them.
[00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:49.016]  But I guess that's okay if you're a yuppie out there.
[00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:53.379]  You like Arnold for president, so why not like pesticide for foster children?
[00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.864]  Another headline, Netherlands hospital euthanizes babies and is very proud of it.
[00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:04.447]  And euthanasia taking place all over America.
[00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:06.471]  Becoming more and more public.
[00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:10.172]  People begging not to be killed are being murdered.
[00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:13.754]  It's all mainstream news telling you how great it all is.
[00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.114]  Oh, testing pesticides on kids, pretty good.
[00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:20.956]  Killing people begging for their lives, pretty good.
[00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:22.856]  We've got these articles for you.
[00:01:23.356 --> 00:01:24.277]  Torture's good.
[00:01:24.657 --> 00:01:25.857]  Open borders are good.
[00:01:26.277 --> 00:01:28.838]  Foreign Nazi krauts for president are good.
[00:01:30.387 --> 00:01:31.427]  Again, folks, I'm part German.
[00:01:31.447 --> 00:01:32.287]  I don't mean that meanly.
[00:01:32.327 --> 00:01:34.888]  I mean it almost sarcastically about Schwarzenegger.
[00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.369]  But the point is, is the guy is a Nazi punk.
[00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.090]  And boy, do I have some new news for you on Schwarzenegger.
[00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:50.992]  He's in Texas right now getting a $20,000 a plate campaign fundraiser.
[00:01:51.172 --> 00:01:52.892]  He won't say if it's for governor or president.
[00:01:55.487 --> 00:02:00.189]  And yesterday, I was going to go up there, but I was just so busy fighting the New World Order here, I didn't do it.
[00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.431]  I really don't have any desire to get near these people.
[00:02:06.412 --> 00:02:10.033]  I got enough of being just a few feet from them at the Republican Convention.
[00:02:12.574 --> 00:02:14.855]  And no, I'm not a Democrat if you tune in for the first time.
[00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:17.516]  I'm talking about just being around the evil, being down there on the floor.
[00:02:18.497 --> 00:02:19.317]  Lord Bush!
[00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:23.739]  Herbert Walker made quite an announcement yesterday for Arnold Schwarzenegger!
[00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:34.317]  For those of you that are still in denial, still in denial about it, and I'll tell you about that when we get back from break.
[00:02:35.357 --> 00:02:46.520]  It's going up on InfoWars.com in the next 30 minutes or so, and it's going up on ArnoldExposed.com later on today as well.
[00:02:50.914 --> 00:02:57.397]  Yeah, George Herbert Walker, the old CIA director, the old UN ambassador, ambassador to China, the super sleuth.
[00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:02.520]  Man running the op in Dealey Plaza.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.380]  Evidence is very clear.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.581]  We know he was on the ground there.
[00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:14.225]  This gentleman had quite an announcement for Arnold yesterday.
[00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:15.986]  You may be wanting to hear about.
[00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:21.086]  Again, there's no way Arnold's going to run for president, is there?
[00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:25.707]  No, there's just been now, going into the second month, what, we're six weeks into it.
[00:03:26.448 --> 00:03:27.928]  Second month will be over in about a week.
[00:03:28.628 --> 00:03:34.230]  Every news channel, every night, everywhere, how wonderful it is, how good he is, how he should be president.
[00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.411]  And the polls just a few months ago were 80% against him.
[00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:40.272]  Now CNN had one.
[00:03:40.312 --> 00:03:41.512]  I don't believe this poll for a minute.
[00:03:41.532 --> 00:03:43.132]  66% why they say he pulls
[00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.721]  Feelings on this are softening.
[00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:52.665]  So don't later go, Alex, why didn't we do something?
[00:03:52.706 --> 00:03:53.146]  No.
[00:03:55.348 --> 00:03:59.392]  And by the way, William Sapphire came out and said it's going to be Arnold against Hillary.
[00:03:59.432 --> 00:04:00.393]  He said that last week.
[00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:02.034]  It's like I said a month ago.
[00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:04.537]  I got these people figured out.
[00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:06.799]  And Neocons will go out and lobby.
[00:04:07.853 --> 00:04:10.695]  I will be told by the Republicans the only way to win is with Arnold.
[00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.156]  One year out from the election, repeal it.
[00:04:13.197 --> 00:04:14.497]  Go to all your state houses.
[00:04:14.798 --> 00:04:15.798]  He is our savior.
[00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:17.259]  The drumbeat will not stop.
[00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.162]  You're looking at four years of continual Arnold Schwarzenegger worship.
[00:04:24.624 --> 00:04:30.288]  And if you say to a Republican, well he's pro-abortion, pro-gun control, pro-open border, pro-stem cell, cloning.
[00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:32.269]  They'll say, shut up, devil!
[00:04:33.107 --> 00:04:34.748]  You are of the devil.
[00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:39.850]  You are talking bad about a messenger from God, a disciple of God, a gift from God.
[00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.151]  That's what they say about Bush.
[00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:43.212]  You're talking about a gift.
[00:04:43.812 --> 00:04:44.653]  A gift from God.
[00:04:44.733 --> 00:04:46.373]  And you don't talk about the gift from God.
[00:04:46.393 --> 00:04:50.796]  Well, I guess God sometimes does curse countries with evil leaders.
[00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:52.376]  Maybe it is what we deserve.
[00:04:52.817 --> 00:04:54.417]  Perhaps they're actually right in a way.
[00:04:55.678 --> 00:04:58.699]  We'll be back with George Bush's announcement for Arnold.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.563]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who's a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:05:06.703 --> 00:05:07.904]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[00:05:08.104 --> 00:05:08.665]  Thank you, Marvin.
[00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:12.227]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[00:05:12.387 --> 00:05:12.907]  Is that true?
[00:05:13.128 --> 00:05:14.128]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:17.450]  You can save 40% or more off the regular US price.
[00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:19.732]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[00:05:19.772 --> 00:05:20.513]  They're very common.
[00:05:20.593 --> 00:05:24.035]  Those common drugs, you can save 50% off the regular US price.
[00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:25.516]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[00:05:25.556 --> 00:05:27.939]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.283]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular US price.
[00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.026]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:39.351]  Yes, the same multinational US corporation makes them in Canada and the US.
[00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:44.536]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll free number for your information package.
[00:05:44.797 --> 00:05:46.759]  To find out more, call toll free 1-800-840-0686.
[00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:47.199]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:48.461]  Or go on the web at www.kenshipdrugs.com.
[00:06:01.104 --> 00:06:04.387]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.427 --> 00:06:08.630]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.672]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.852 --> 00:06:14.254]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.454 --> 00:06:23.101]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.281 --> 00:06:24.622]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:28.985]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:29.826]  We're good to go.
[00:07:01.427 --> 00:07:04.368]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:06.310]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:12.253]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:17.797]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:07:18.077 --> 00:07:19.698]  Brace yourselves as the new world order
[00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:21.359]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:07:39.565 --> 00:07:39.985]  Big Brother.
[00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:40.565]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.504 --> 00:08:13.907]  Unofficially, the new film I've been working on that'll be ready, that'll be released February 27th,
[00:08:37.859 --> 00:08:50.582]  Of next year, in about a little under three months, it may even be released a little bit early, but I'm just giving myself the time because with something this powerful, we have to make sure it's done properly.
[00:08:52.202 --> 00:08:53.983]  Unofficially, really, it's Police State 4.
[00:08:55.843 --> 00:09:00.724]  But people get the idea with Hollywood movies and stuff that, you know, as the films progress, they get worse.
[00:09:02.524 --> 00:09:05.125]  Well, actually, with our films, as they progress, they get better.
[00:09:06.644 --> 00:09:11.906]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement that I made last year has been hailed as one of my best videos.
[00:09:15.168 --> 00:09:24.352]  But, uh, Martial Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, I think is going to be my best film.
[00:09:27.113 --> 00:09:29.394]  Because it's going to cover everything.
[00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:37.027]  It's not just about the Republican National Convention, because we zoom in on the characters of the Republican National Convention.
[00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:44.453]  We show people, it's just indescribable, there's too much that's going to be in this video.
[00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:55.202]  It's just, it's going to, the Arnold-Nazi connection, the Bush-Nazi connection, the latest 9-11 information, it's just incredible.
[00:09:57.045 --> 00:10:04.207]  The Police State of New York, the Soundwave Cannons and Weapons, Bohemian Grove, I Confront Michael Gergen, Skull and Bones.
[00:10:05.627 --> 00:10:09.328]  It is... I'm very excited about this film.
[00:10:11.349 --> 00:10:20.671]  And later today you'll be able to watch the four and a half minute trailer for Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:29.167]  Okay, that announcement out of the way.
[00:10:29.227 --> 00:10:34.209]  Just keep your eyes peeled on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:39.192]  Coming up, Ridge quits Homeland Security post.
[00:10:39.312 --> 00:10:41.133]  Meet the new puppet, same as the old puppet.
[00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:44.275]  Princess Believe bodyguard was bumped off.
[00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:48.097]  The reason I cover this is this last week was in the British News.
[00:10:49.478 --> 00:10:53.100]  A new videotape where she thinks her boyfriend was killed.
[00:10:53.959 --> 00:11:02.304]  And then, of course, two months before she was murdered in Paris, she said, they're going to kill me in a fake auto accident on video.
[00:11:03.325 --> 00:11:05.026]  They won't release that, but they admit she taped it.
[00:11:06.006 --> 00:11:09.068]  Prince Charles will kill me in a fake auto accident, I've already been told.
[00:11:14.031 --> 00:11:19.454]  And boy, when she got pregnant, and when the phone taps showed that, it was over for her.
[00:11:19.494 --> 00:11:22.576]  They're not going to have, you know, some hero, but married into the royal family.
[00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:27.668]  And I'm just covering that because it finally has been on NBC and now it's here in the Associated Press.
[00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:31.049]  We'll go over that.
[00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:44.075]  I've had press call me before for articles in Vanity Fair or articles for major publications.
[00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:50.574]  And about half the time they go, well you believe the conspiracy theory that they killed Princess Di.
[00:11:51.094 --> 00:11:55.117]  And I go, gee, in polls it's about 78% on average.
[00:11:55.558 --> 00:11:58.640]  The polls are in the high 70s, low 80s in England.
[00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:02.183]  And she said they were going to kill her in a fake auto accident.
[00:12:02.724 --> 00:12:05.186]  And then gee, they turned the cameras off in the tunnel.
[00:12:05.927 --> 00:12:12.152]  And gee, her car had been stolen the week before and then had been returned magically all detailed for her.
[00:12:13.115 --> 00:12:15.776]  And then her security didn't have a problem with it and didn't check it out.
[00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:21.358]  Gee, they kept her at the scene for 45 minutes and then drove 20 miles an hour in the ambulance.
[00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:24.239]  And it goes on and on.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.241]  And gee, she said her husband was going to kill her.
[00:12:29.821 --> 00:12:31.462]  He's going to kill me in a fake auto accident!
[00:12:31.662 --> 00:12:33.063]  And you die in an auto accident!
[00:12:33.463 --> 00:12:34.043]  Oh man!
[00:12:34.643 --> 00:12:36.284]  Man, I'm a conspiracy theorist!
[00:12:40.293 --> 00:12:43.274]  It was American Legion Magazine, yeah, they brought that up to me, too.
[00:12:44.755 --> 00:12:52.158]  By the way, ArnoldExposed.com did make Time Magazine this week, and I was aware of it, but I just hadn't gotten to it.
[00:12:52.198 --> 00:12:53.659]  People are sending me emails about it.
[00:12:53.679 --> 00:12:55.060]  A little blurb.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:01.182]  A lot fairer than CNN, though I know that it's all part of the same body.
[00:13:02.103 --> 00:13:04.404]  CNN has this lavish report yesterday
[00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:09.001]  Talking about how Morgan Toler Jones is this grassroots woman who cares.
[00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:11.962]  Just a middle class lady doing this for Arnold.
[00:13:12.002 --> 00:13:13.102]  How great she is.
[00:13:13.182 --> 00:13:15.924]  And there's this guy Alex Jones.
[00:13:15.964 --> 00:13:17.064]  What's up with him?
[00:13:17.084 --> 00:13:24.307]  And I'm told there's going to be this huge USA Today article.
[00:13:24.567 --> 00:13:25.488]  I didn't even look today.
[00:13:25.528 --> 00:13:27.048]  It's today, tomorrow, or Friday.
[00:13:27.268 --> 00:13:28.469]  They're not specific about it.
[00:13:32.851 --> 00:13:47.636]  There's so much serious news and I don't want to spend all day on Arnold Schwarzenegger, but I hope you take me serious because we need at least $20,000 to run ads in Sacramento and LA and Austin.
[00:13:48.576 --> 00:13:54.921]  And it will have an effect, because at that point, we can force the media to put us on some of the big TV shows.
[00:13:55.322 --> 00:14:00.666]  Right now, Morgenthaler Jones, that I know of, has been on over 50 national TV shows.
[00:14:00.866 --> 00:14:07.812]  She's been on CNN six times, not counting a blurb that ran on Headline News every hour for two days.
[00:14:10.314 --> 00:14:15.699]  We, on the other hand, have been given a 22nd blurb on CNN that aired a few times, and she got half that time.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.323]  I mean, she's on Good Morning America for ten minutes.
[00:14:20.363 --> 00:14:29.377]  She's on all these shows, endlessly, along with all the senators and congressmen and George Herbert Walker Bush and all of them, pushing for Arnold to be president.
[00:14:31.974 --> 00:14:32.674]  Jay Leno.
[00:14:33.014 --> 00:14:47.379]  I mean, we're into the sixth week now of just wall-to-wall, endless, total media saturation about how wonderful Arnold is, how he's gotta be our president, how they want to change the Constitution.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.341]  They're just acclimating you, getting you used to hearing about this.
[00:14:53.562 --> 00:14:54.302]  It's a basic
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.741]  Basic psychology.
[00:14:56.801 --> 00:14:59.883]  And after I cover this, we'll get to New York's guinea pig kids.
[00:15:00.363 --> 00:15:03.725]  After they grab your child, they test AIDS chemicals on them.
[00:15:04.646 --> 00:15:05.506]  Treatments on them.
[00:15:05.526 --> 00:15:07.007]  They test pesticides on them.
[00:15:08.028 --> 00:15:10.409]  That's BBC out of ABC News.
[00:15:10.469 --> 00:15:12.430]  Netherlands Hospital euthanizes babies.
[00:15:13.091 --> 00:15:14.972]  I've got adults here being euthanized.
[00:15:14.992 --> 00:15:17.914]  I mean, this is just what's going on, folks!
[00:15:19.295 --> 00:15:21.296]  But before I go any further,
[00:15:22.082 --> 00:15:27.485]  You know, I wanted to go up to this in College Station yesterday, but I just had too much to do.
[00:15:29.506 --> 00:15:44.033]  And if I went up there and tried to bullhorn Lord Schwarzenegger and Lord Herbert Walker Bush, even though it's against state law, they've lost a bunch of lawsuits, College Station will still have you arrested, even if you're on public property.
[00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:51.557]  And the media probably would still ignore it, no matter how many people we got up there, what we did.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:59.403]  So I didn't go to this event, and he's in Dallas right now getting a $20,000 a plate fundraiser.
[00:15:59.423 --> 00:16:02.224]  They say thousands of people are there with $20,000 a plate.
[00:16:02.424 --> 00:16:05.065]  But again, he won't say whether it's for the gubernatorial run or presidential.
[00:16:07.426 --> 00:16:10.167]  I'm not sure I'm even going to run for governor.
[00:16:10.787 --> 00:16:13.828]  Meanwhile, he's out raising money.
[00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:16.610]  This is a tactic they use.
[00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.871]  Oh, there is no Patriot Act 2 six months after it's introduced, or
[00:16:20.603 --> 00:16:25.428]  Karl Rove's advising Arnold on how to run for president, and everybody's pushing him, but he's not going to do that.
[00:16:25.488 --> 00:16:30.273]  Maria Shriver comes out in Vanity Fair and says... He didn't say exactly that, though.
[00:16:31.874 --> 00:16:35.838]  Reuters picked up on it, and the headline, Maria says Arnold won't be president.
[00:16:36.038 --> 00:16:37.600]  Then you read the article, it doesn't really say that.
[00:16:38.641 --> 00:16:40.122]  Oh, I believe he'll amend the Constitution.
[00:16:40.162 --> 00:16:40.883]  I'm all for it.
[00:16:41.103 --> 00:16:42.445]  My foreigners deserve it.
[00:16:43.065 --> 00:16:44.507]  But it won't be my husband, don't worry.
[00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:48.170]  Governor receives Bush Award.
[00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.331]  Others like Mikhail Gorbachev get it.
[00:16:50.731 --> 00:16:51.991]  Who could also be your president?
[00:16:54.252 --> 00:16:55.772]  And countless others.
[00:16:58.173 --> 00:17:00.414]  George Soros could be your president.
[00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:03.675]  Governor...Vicente Fox.
[00:17:04.095 --> 00:17:06.016]  Governor receives Bush Award.
[00:17:06.696 --> 00:17:08.777]  Former President George H.W.
[00:17:08.817 --> 00:17:13.439]  Bush presented Governor Schwarzenegger an award for public service
[00:17:15.484 --> 00:17:24.166]  Yesterday, and suggested that the foreign-born former action movie star could someday be elected president.
[00:17:25.126 --> 00:17:35.048]  In regard to him ever being president of the United States, my advice to you Aggies and to any of those doubters, don't bet against Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:17:36.928 --> 00:17:42.169]  Bush told about 2,500 people attending the awards ceremony at Texas A&M University.
[00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:50.520]  The former president didn't endorse Schwarzenegger for the nation's highest office.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.161]  Oh no, just Karl Rove and all your minions are.
[00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:57.602]  But he obliquely referred to recent discussions about amending the U.S.
[00:17:57.642 --> 00:18:00.643]  Constitution to allow a foreign-born citizen to be president.
[00:18:01.003 --> 00:18:11.726]  Schwarzenegger, who was born in Austria currently, is ineligible to the White House, but Bush said people have been underestimating him during his entire career as a bodybuilder, actor, and now governor.
[00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:21.204]  Schwarzenegger tried to downplay the presidential speculation about himself, but he said immigrants should be able to have the opportunity to run for office.
[00:18:21.244 --> 00:18:28.847]  See, but just like the recall, they'll let conservatives start the recall, they'll pull McClintock out and stick Schwarzenegger in.
[00:18:29.187 --> 00:18:29.987]  Same thing will happen here.
[00:18:30.788 --> 00:18:39.491]  I'd like the opportunity, he replied, eliciting much laughter, when an immigrant questioner in the audience said he didn't believe immigrants should be president.
[00:18:41.032 --> 00:18:41.572]  An immigrant!
[00:18:42.182 --> 00:18:43.403]  And the audience didn't believe it.
[00:18:43.883 --> 00:18:45.624]  Of course, not because of me.
[00:18:45.644 --> 00:18:48.245]  I only have an interest to fix California.
[00:18:48.825 --> 00:18:49.505]  The governor added.
[00:18:49.825 --> 00:19:03.532]  But I think that if someone lives here a period of time, and votes, and all that, and makes good contributions to the community, I think someone, yeah, should have the right to also run for president.
[00:19:05.412 --> 00:19:06.233]  I'm going to get you.
[00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:08.694]  Eating is not cheating.
[00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:11.569]  I'm going to dominate and rule over you.
[00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:12.750]  I want to control people.
[00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.511]  I want to be washed up like a Nuremberg.
[00:19:14.532 --> 00:19:17.574]  I have dreams of being king of Earth every night.
[00:19:18.394 --> 00:19:19.395]  Wouldn't that be a good prep?
[00:19:19.615 --> 00:19:21.316]  I mean, come on, people!
[00:19:22.657 --> 00:19:25.739]  You try going to Austria and trying to run for president over there.
[00:19:27.441 --> 00:19:29.502]  But they got everybody behind them.
[00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:36.387]  It's wall to wall into the sixth week of it being a top news story on a nightly basis.
[00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:39.789]  And they're going to keep pushing it until you just expect it.
[00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.894]  And they're not going to have anybody on these shows against Morgenthau or Jones, the minion of Arnold.
[00:19:45.974 --> 00:19:48.837]  No, no, it's just going to all be positive!
[00:19:48.857 --> 00:19:49.438]  24-7!
[00:19:50.639 --> 00:19:51.900]  That's your indicator!
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.083]  Just like President Bush said, don't underestimate him.
[00:19:56.364 --> 00:19:57.205]  Don't doubt it!
[00:19:58.326 --> 00:19:59.627]  Resistance is futile!
[00:20:03.524 --> 00:20:09.006]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:09.426 --> 00:20:13.648]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:20:13.888 --> 00:20:20.931]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:27.413]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:20:27.554 --> 00:20:28.774]  There are no side effects.
[00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:32.058]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:20:32.218 --> 00:20:34.160]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:41.769]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.454]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:21:14.213 --> 00:21:18.879]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:21:19.339 --> 00:21:26.063]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.

[00:22:57.899 --> 00:22:58.602]  Conditions apply.
[00:23:00.575 --> 00:23:04.498]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:23:04.718 --> 00:23:16.987]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:23:17.407 --> 00:23:17.827]  The U.S.
[00:23:17.867 --> 00:23:23.451]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:26.053]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:23:27.914 --> 00:23:28.975]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:23:29.015 --> 00:23:31.856]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:23:31.956 --> 00:23:37.999]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:23:38.419 --> 00:23:41.781]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:23:41.841 --> 00:23:48.184]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:23:48.744 --> 00:23:52.768]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:23:52.888 --> 00:23:53.068]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:53.088 --> 00:23:53.288]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:16.517 --> 00:24:25.646]  We've caught the globalists creating artificial scarcity with water, with diamonds, and then artificially depressing the value of things like gold in the past.
[00:24:26.187 --> 00:24:27.628]  This is what they're masters of.
[00:24:28.449 --> 00:24:32.913]  And I've seen a lot of evidence towards the fact that we have an overabundance of oil.
[00:24:33.914 --> 00:24:38.779]  Now that doesn't mean that they aren't going to artificially jack up the prices and that there isn't a crisis.
[00:24:39.781 --> 00:24:51.749]  But I said I'm, after the election was over, I said that I would, after Bush was installed, as I said he would be, I'm not bragging folks, it was staged from the start, that we would cover peak oil.
[00:24:51.769 --> 00:24:57.532]  So we're going to have folks on the next few weeks who are believers in peak oil, that there's no oil left basically.
[00:24:58.433 --> 00:25:07.399]  And today we have Lindsey Williams, who worked for one of the big oil companies up in Alaska, who wrote the non-energy crisis, joining us in the third hour.
[00:25:08.456 --> 00:25:14.460]  Now, in the second hour of this broadcast today, we're going to have Paul Watson.
[00:25:15.401 --> 00:25:17.542]  Lord Watson from the United Kingdom.
[00:25:18.203 --> 00:25:19.003]  That's a joke, folks.
[00:25:19.044 --> 00:25:19.724]  Lord Watson, yes.
[00:25:20.004 --> 00:25:21.345]  From England, you know where they have lords.
[00:25:24.227 --> 00:25:26.529]  And so, that is coming up as well.
[00:25:26.629 --> 00:25:28.270]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.031]  But Governor Bush's daddy,
[00:25:37.233 --> 00:25:47.518]  Again, the former president, now his son is El Presidente, up in College Station said, don't underestimate, don't bet against Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:25:47.698 --> 00:25:52.461]  My advice to you is, the doubters is, take this seriously.
[00:25:53.561 --> 00:25:58.344]  In regard to him ever being president of the United States, my advice to you, Aggies and up.
[00:25:59.131 --> 00:26:02.534]  Any of those doubters don't bet against Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:26:02.854 --> 00:26:07.877]  Bush told about 2,500 people attending the awards ceremony at Texas A&M University.
[00:26:10.179 --> 00:26:12.541]  And then people started standing up saying they were against him.
[00:26:13.601 --> 00:26:14.722]  Oh, man, I wish I'd have been there.
[00:26:14.742 --> 00:26:16.704]  I need to get video of that.
[00:26:16.724 --> 00:26:19.966]  Did somebody tape that off Dallas News or College Station News?
[00:26:21.927 --> 00:26:23.468]  And then somebody stood up and said, I'm an immigrant.
[00:26:23.488 --> 00:26:24.929]  I'm against immigrants being president.
[00:26:24.969 --> 00:26:28.292]  Arnold said, well, I think we deserve it.
[00:26:29.099 --> 00:26:33.540]  And he's got his wife running defense, going, Arnold will never be president.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.620]  Well, that's the headline, actually.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.701]  She said, oh, we're going to amend the Constitution, but it's not going to be for my husband.
[00:26:38.721 --> 00:26:41.141]  It's like she said, oh, he's not running for governor.
[00:26:42.202 --> 00:26:46.442]  After he'd already covertly told his advisors months before he was.
[00:26:46.903 --> 00:26:48.383]  It's all staged!
[00:26:49.183 --> 00:26:54.104]  And they'll just deny, deny, deny, whether he's pronouncing it every night, just acclimating you to accept it.
[00:26:55.555 --> 00:27:07.761]  Meanwhile, on page 22 of this week's Time Magazine, they have the Amend for Arnold crowd and a little blurb about how we're fighting them at ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:14.064]  Look, folks, I've gone out, I've been working on the TV ad, working on the radio ad.
[00:27:14.805 --> 00:27:18.606]  We've called Sacramento, called LA, we got the prices.
[00:27:19.687 --> 00:27:23.429]  We're going to get these on the next few weeks, but
[00:27:24.747 --> 00:27:25.847]  We need more money.
[00:27:27.628 --> 00:27:35.070]  And believe me, you want to strike at the heart of the New World Order, this Schwarzenegger thing can be easily derailed.
[00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:39.412]  It is an uphill battle, but they're going to make it.
[00:27:39.452 --> 00:27:41.893]  They're arrogant, they're in your face unless you stand up against them.
[00:27:41.913 --> 00:27:49.055]  Unless we somehow force the media to cover the fact that the majority of us are against this and it doesn't make sense and who Arnold Schwarzenegger really is.
[00:27:50.598 --> 00:28:08.987]  If we just let them have reports every day for the next three years, which they're gonna do, just every day, everywhere, how good it is, how positive it is, and don't force them to cover the fact that the majority of us are against it, and how crazy this is, then they're gonna get away with it.
[00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:10.908]  And why is Schwarzenegger dangerous?
[00:28:10.948 --> 00:28:20.192]  Because he's totally compromised with all his Nazi, pro-Nazi comments and the rest of it, and pro-Hitler comments, and all the drug use, and all the gay porn,
[00:28:21.713 --> 00:28:23.194]  He is totally compromised.
[00:28:24.495 --> 00:28:27.836]  And he's already given $5 million to the Israel lobby.
[00:28:28.937 --> 00:28:31.258]  And, folks, he's in their hip pocket.
[00:28:32.199 --> 00:28:36.461]  And they could care less of the guy at Meiners Hitler, because they can crush him any time they want.
[00:28:38.242 --> 00:28:39.763]  But you can forget the Israel lobby.
[00:28:39.783 --> 00:28:40.804]  They're only about 10% of this.
[00:28:43.564 --> 00:28:48.927]  It's the Neocon Lobby and the Bohemian Grove Lobby, the George Sulz's, the George Herbert Walker Bush's.
[00:28:49.308 --> 00:28:51.569]  Arnold's been going to that for decades, since 86.
[00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:53.690]  Coming up on 20 years.
[00:28:54.271 --> 00:28:55.151]  Or is it 18 years?
[00:28:57.532 --> 00:29:00.114]  And he's married into the Kennedys.
[00:29:00.654 --> 00:29:02.435]  He's got the elite totally behind him.
[00:29:02.475 --> 00:29:04.257]  He's got the liberal media, the conservative media.
[00:29:04.277 --> 00:29:06.538]  I mean, Fox News did a report last night.
[00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:09.979]  And I've got the text of it that was absolute worship.
[00:29:10.019 --> 00:29:22.904]  Just, Arnold needs to be president, he's good, we need to change it, Morgenthaler Jones is wonderful, Arnold is so conservative, and don't think conservatives will not go out and vote for this guy.
[00:29:24.204 --> 00:29:27.446]  They'll say, I love abortion, I love gun control, hail Arnold.
[00:29:27.926 --> 00:29:29.206]  Well, he's buttered Hillary.
[00:29:29.726 --> 00:29:31.747]  This is how they get us, this is how they win.
[00:29:32.087 --> 00:29:33.448]  They give us false choices.
[00:29:33.468 --> 00:29:35.068]  It's like Limbaugh.
[00:29:35.969 --> 00:29:36.669]  Ultra-liberal.
[00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:39.804]  They figured out how to win by giving you a false choice.
[00:29:40.424 --> 00:29:41.685]  I'll explain that when we get back.
[00:29:42.626 --> 00:29:44.007]  I'm not joking about that, by the way.
[00:29:44.568 --> 00:29:45.508]  And we'll take your calls.
[00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.449]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.613 --> 00:29:52.554]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.014 --> 00:29:54.635]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.536 --> 00:29:58.238]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.275 --> 00:30:04.297]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[00:30:04.678 --> 00:30:07.179]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:14.485]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:30:14.685 --> 00:30:17.967]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[00:30:18.227 --> 00:30:20.249]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:30:20.589 --> 00:30:28.415]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:30:28.675 --> 00:30:29.956]  Either way, why chance it?

[00:30:58.818 --> 00:30:59.953]  Seamineral.com
[00:31:00.979 --> 00:31:02.580]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.841]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:06.961 --> 00:31:09.842]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:09.922 --> 00:31:16.644]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:16.824 --> 00:31:19.825]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.025 --> 00:31:22.426]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:22.546 --> 00:31:30.428]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:31:30.708 --> 00:31:42.036]  Nitrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:31:42.176 --> 00:31:49.781]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:49.802 --> 00:31:50.102]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:50.162 --> 00:31:52.163]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:32:01.411 --> 00:32:02.932]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.992 --> 00:32:05.374]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[00:32:05.734 --> 00:32:06.615]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:32:06.975 --> 00:32:08.196]  Oil War III has started.
[00:32:08.516 --> 00:32:10.958]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[00:32:11.358 --> 00:32:14.760]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[00:32:15.201 --> 00:32:16.021]  Why else would the U.S.
[00:32:16.041 --> 00:32:19.023]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[00:32:19.263 --> 00:32:20.544]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[00:32:20.985 --> 00:32:25.448]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[00:32:25.888 --> 00:32:29.871]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[00:32:30.391 --> 00:32:36.294]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[00:32:36.534 --> 00:32:42.657]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[00:32:43.157 --> 00:32:43.737]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:32:43.757 --> 00:32:49.400]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.221]  That's 1-800-453-2202 or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:52.581]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:33:01.514 --> 00:33:07.157]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:09.458 --> 00:33:12.319]  Listen up, and listen up good.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:29.268]  If you don't want a foreigner who openly says they want to dominate and control you, and take your freedoms and take your guns, and is pro-abortion, pro-cloning, pro-everything evil, then you'd better get off your hind-ends.
[00:33:29.952 --> 00:33:41.040]  We're going to go to Ron and Kyle and Don and everybody else here and get into all the euthanasia and testing pesticides and drugs on foster children and just all mainstream in your face, the evil of who runs this government.
[00:33:43.322 --> 00:33:44.502]  The evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:45.443 --> 00:33:51.487]  Now what they do is they create like a fake football game atmosphere of rah-rah Democrats against Republicans.
[00:33:52.088 --> 00:33:54.810]  And they get you all in this simulated political combat.
[00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:55.890]  But it's not real.
[00:33:55.951 --> 00:33:57.892]  It's like WWF wrestling.
[00:34:00.333 --> 00:34:08.639]  And then they have these fights over fake issues when in reality the agendas are identical or ninety-nine percent of the same.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:16.564]  And in many cases the Democrats carry out one part of the agenda and the Republicans act like they oppose it but carry out the other part of the agenda.
[00:34:20.327 --> 00:34:26.031]  And they do what is diametrically opposed to the Constitution and the will and common sense of the people.
[00:34:28.613 --> 00:34:29.774]  I mean in major polls
[00:34:30.774 --> 00:34:35.857]  It was like 95% of people were against the New Freedom Initiative.
[00:34:36.917 --> 00:34:42.000]  They almost got a, actually they did, a two-thirds majority in the House and in the Senate.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.101]  The vote in the House was 300 and something.
[00:34:45.281 --> 00:34:46.742]  It was just amazing.
[00:34:47.842 --> 00:34:53.165]  To pass that baby for forced psychological testing of all children, starting with adults with pregnant women.
[00:34:55.164 --> 00:35:05.906]  We've got Republican governors, Democratic governors around the country announcing they want to put satellite trackers or transponders in the cars or use the cameras that scan your license plates to tax you by the mile.
[00:35:06.606 --> 00:35:07.826]  They had a California poll, 95.4%.
[00:35:08.347 --> 00:35:16.668]  In Texas, they're putting in the same transponder systems in Houston and Austin in the next two years.
[00:35:17.208 --> 00:35:18.628]  Houston poll, Houston Chronicle, 98%.
[00:35:18.668 --> 00:35:18.988]  Austin poll, 93%.
[00:35:22.651 --> 00:35:23.652]  They just don't care!
[00:35:23.672 --> 00:35:25.152]  They just laugh at us!
[00:35:25.212 --> 00:35:27.614]  I say we've got a dumbed-down population.
[00:35:28.114 --> 00:35:29.815]  That's true to a certain extent.
[00:35:29.835 --> 00:35:37.979]  I mean, a certain group of people in America do not know how many continents there are, can't find Iraq on a map, don't know who the Vice President is.
[00:35:38.059 --> 00:35:40.721]  The majority of high school seniors don't know who the Vice President is.
[00:35:41.441 --> 00:35:44.803]  Even back when it wasn't somebody hiding in a bunker all the time, they didn't know who Al Gore was.
[00:35:47.011 --> 00:36:02.742]  I mean, I've heard Sean Hannity, one of the few good things he does is he sends his wife's friend, who's a big liberal, like him, out on the street with a cell phone and just walk up and go, who's John Kerry's running mate?
[00:36:02.762 --> 00:36:05.303]  And he talked to like 15 people and not one of them knew.
[00:36:05.504 --> 00:36:06.664]  But I'm voting for Kerry!
[00:36:08.946 --> 00:36:13.489]  And Republicans are a little more informed, but they're only gone down one more layer of the onion.
[00:36:15.678 --> 00:36:17.879]  They think that they know everything about politics.
[00:36:17.939 --> 00:36:20.580]  Why, they might even be able to find Iraq on a map for you.
[00:36:22.421 --> 00:36:24.742]  They might be able to even tell you what the Fourth Amendment is.
[00:36:25.682 --> 00:36:27.303]  But that's as far as it goes.
[00:36:28.183 --> 00:36:29.584]  They know big government's bad.
[00:36:29.644 --> 00:36:30.825]  They know welfare's bad.
[00:36:31.265 --> 00:36:33.326]  But they only know about individual welfare.
[00:36:33.946 --> 00:36:37.247]  They don't know about corporate welfare, which is many times bigger.
[00:36:38.008 --> 00:36:38.788]  They think that's wonderful.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:51.451]  And so you listen to a limball, how were the corporations that own our government, own our country, that are not free market, how are they going to fool us to stay in big government as it expands and straitjackets us?
[00:36:52.371 --> 00:37:03.062]  Well, they put out a bunch of phony conservatives who attack the democratic agenda, which is a bad agenda by and large, but then they have almost the same agenda, but they attack that agenda and then give the people a false choice.
[00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:08.731]  And then don't talk about Bush doubling the growth rate of government, what it was under Bill Clinton.
[00:37:08.751 --> 00:37:11.813]  And by the way, only 30% of that's military increases.
[00:37:12.193 --> 00:37:19.336]  70% is all the classic, big, great society boondoggles getting us dependent.
[00:37:19.957 --> 00:37:28.080]  I mean, this guy's bigger government than Roosevelt, bigger than Truman, bigger than LBJ.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:28.981]  I mean, it's just the numbers.
[00:37:31.044 --> 00:37:32.405]  But see, they don't want to hear about that.
[00:37:32.685 --> 00:37:34.005]  Because to them, it's a football game.
[00:37:34.045 --> 00:37:36.166]  It's like going, I don't like your Dallas Cowboys!
[00:37:36.827 --> 00:37:39.288]  And they go, listen to me, you red skin.
[00:37:40.428 --> 00:37:42.129]  Don't you talk bad about my team.
[00:37:42.149 --> 00:37:47.231]  And I'm like, it's just... The thinking process gets switched off.
[00:37:47.291 --> 00:37:50.713]  And then maybe you can reach through to them and they go, well, he's better than Kerry.
[00:37:52.314 --> 00:37:53.074]  It didn't matter.
[00:37:53.134 --> 00:37:54.395]  It was staged from the beginning.
[00:37:54.455 --> 00:37:55.415]  It wasn't a choice.
[00:37:55.715 --> 00:37:59.737]  It was Bush ordained, ordained long before.
[00:38:03.103 --> 00:38:04.824]  I'm inventing words like Jesse Jackson now.
[00:38:06.844 --> 00:38:09.745]  So, I mean, I look at this.
[00:38:10.965 --> 00:38:13.326]  And I look at polls where 80% are against Arnold.
[00:38:15.527 --> 00:38:16.087]  Being present.
[00:38:18.208 --> 00:38:23.149]  And then I look at the TV shows and it's wall-to-wall how great he is, how wonderful he is, how we all gotta vote for him.
[00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:32.272]  And they're making all the moves, they've introduced the bills, Dana Rohrabacher says it's Arnold in 08, ha ha ha!
[00:38:35.669 --> 00:38:42.231]  Former President Bush, father of the Governor, father of the now President, says, don't underestimate him, folks, take it serious.
[00:38:45.132 --> 00:38:46.592]  Yes, I'm taking it serious!
[00:38:47.812 --> 00:38:49.613]  Look, Arnold is God to these people.
[00:38:51.853 --> 00:38:52.874]  He admires Hitler.
[00:38:52.894 --> 00:38:54.574]  You know, all the things that have gone over, they don't care.
[00:38:54.634 --> 00:38:55.234]  They cover it up.
[00:38:55.254 --> 00:38:55.714]  They ignore it.
[00:38:55.874 --> 00:38:58.235]  And they have no one on TV countering these people.
[00:38:58.835 --> 00:39:01.916]  I mean, the new campaign began when the last campaign ended.
[00:39:03.852 --> 00:39:08.194]  I mean, the day after the campaign, folks, they launched this Arnold thing, and it's been wall-to-wall since.
[00:39:08.214 --> 00:39:13.818]  In fact, it was even going on weeks before that, when he was in Ohio and everywhere.
[00:39:14.038 --> 00:39:16.659]  Oh, man, President, oh, they're not stopping.
[00:39:16.719 --> 00:39:18.100]  Can you not see the agenda?
[00:39:20.401 --> 00:39:27.385]  And conservatives are going to hear George Bush and hear Orrin Hatch and hear all these people endorsing Arnold for President, and they're going to say,
[00:39:28.504 --> 00:39:30.085]  Well, I guess I better do that.
[00:39:30.185 --> 00:39:33.948]  I mean, and then they're going to play it off with Arnold versus Hillary.
[00:39:35.188 --> 00:39:37.110]  And they're going to say, only Arnold can defeat her.
[00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.771]  Why, in polls it shows he can defeat her.
[00:39:38.791 --> 00:39:40.572]  You know, they'll be putting out these polls by then.
[00:39:40.592 --> 00:39:46.336]  And this is the Karl Rove plan, who's admittedly advising Arnold by phone every week through George Shultz.
[00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:53.182]  When Bush is done, it's Arnold's turn, Rohrabacher said.
[00:39:53.942 --> 00:39:56.142]  And we're going to sit here in denial about this.
[00:39:56.643 --> 00:39:57.923]  Look, I'm trying to warn you.
[00:39:58.203 --> 00:40:00.503]  I'm trying to get you in gear to stop this.
[00:40:00.543 --> 00:40:01.664]  And we can stop it.
[00:40:03.204 --> 00:40:04.924]  You've got to go to ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:40:05.144 --> 00:40:07.665]  And you need to go to the PayPal link and give us $20.
[00:40:07.785 --> 00:40:11.846]  And every red cent will go to running ads.
[00:40:11.906 --> 00:40:15.047]  And the ads are so, the media cannot ignore what we're doing.
[00:40:15.347 --> 00:40:16.487]  That will force them.
[00:40:17.375 --> 00:40:18.736]  Plus, the ads will be online.
[00:40:18.756 --> 00:40:20.196]  Millions will see them that way.
[00:40:20.476 --> 00:40:26.999]  The radio ads are going to air here, and we're going to buy some time on some key stations in Sacramento and L.A., maybe even D.C.
[00:40:27.019 --> 00:40:29.620]  Depends on how much money comes in.
[00:40:31.101 --> 00:40:39.124]  And the problem is, you buy $10,000 worth of ads, you actually get far less than if you buy $20,000 worth.
[00:40:39.144 --> 00:40:39.984]  It's like, it's weird.
[00:40:40.004 --> 00:40:43.305]  You know, it's like when you buy something in bulk.
[00:40:44.266 --> 00:40:45.326]  If you buy $20,000 worth, the ads are $15 apiece.
[00:40:47.805 --> 00:40:50.447]  And if you buy $10,000 worth, they're $100 a piece.
[00:40:50.487 --> 00:40:53.748]  I mean, it's actually much more.
[00:40:54.289 --> 00:40:55.409]  It's weird how they do it.
[00:40:55.569 --> 00:40:56.590]  We need your support.
[00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.552]  ArnoldExposed.com or write to me.
[00:40:59.572 --> 00:41:02.613]  Write a check right now to Alex Jones on the bottom of it.
[00:41:02.894 --> 00:41:04.835]  Save for the Arnold campaign in the memo section.
[00:41:05.235 --> 00:41:06.916]  And we've got a ledger.
[00:41:07.196 --> 00:41:08.337]  Quite a few checks have come in.
[00:41:08.637 --> 00:41:09.377]  Most of them small.
[00:41:09.397 --> 00:41:11.218]  I want to thank those that have sent them in.
[00:41:11.919 --> 00:41:13.440]  And it's all going in the account.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.900]  And we are going to spend it on this. 100%.
[00:41:19.232 --> 00:41:23.333]  Help us stop a foreigner from being our president.
[00:41:24.434 --> 00:41:38.919]  And lastly, and then I'll go to your calls, lastly on this subject, contact CNN, contact Fox, nicely, contact ABC, contact them all.
[00:41:39.959 --> 00:41:46.702]  Get their emails, their phone numbers, call them and go, man, all I see is this Amend for Arnold group all over your channels every day.
[00:41:46.762 --> 00:41:47.462]  I mean, every day.
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.742]  And only CNN has just mentioned our website.
[00:41:55.023 --> 00:41:57.725]  She gets five minutes and now they mention us for five seconds.
[00:41:59.145 --> 00:42:03.728]  Why won't you have a Groupon that represents the views of the majority of the American people?
[00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:31.042]  Because they can't have me on, folks, because they know what's true, they know what's backed up, they know all the mainstream news articles I've got posted, hundreds of them, with the, I dream of walking the earth as the ruler of the earth, I dream of being your king and ruling you, and I admire Hitler and dictators, and I want to be worshipped at Nuremberg, and everyone agreeing with what I say, and I'm in the gay porno mags, and I'm in the... They know!
[00:42:32.402 --> 00:42:35.704]  They know that Arnold cannot survive real exposure!
[00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:40.123]  I don't even care if they put me on TV.
[00:42:40.243 --> 00:42:41.204]  I don't even care about it.
[00:42:41.805 --> 00:42:47.030]  You challenge them to talk about, not the Nazi allegations, we got the quotes, the admissions!
[00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:48.371]  We got him telling U.S.
[00:42:48.411 --> 00:42:55.017]  News and World Report that we're little people, we need to be dominated and controlled, and have our lives run, and told what to do!
[00:42:55.037 --> 00:42:56.979]  And how to behave!
[00:42:58.982 --> 00:43:04.645]  He's a guy who's so mean to people on movie sets, it's in scores of publications, he never challenges it.
[00:43:04.825 --> 00:43:07.947]  He makes people grovel and call themselves ugly dogs!
[00:43:08.887 --> 00:43:10.148]  He's a scumbag!
[00:43:10.468 --> 00:43:11.728]  He's everything I hate!
[00:43:11.989 --> 00:43:13.289]  I can't stand bullies!
[00:43:13.649 --> 00:43:15.870]  And arrogant, preening peacocks!
[00:43:17.731 --> 00:43:20.673]  Narcissistic, megalomaniacal maniacs!
[00:43:21.661 --> 00:43:23.702]  He is a textbook beast man!
[00:43:23.942 --> 00:43:29.004]  The archetypal image they want to stick on the American Empire, and they're gonna do it to us!
[00:43:31.565 --> 00:43:35.707]  And folks, things go bad when Austrians take over foreign countries.
[00:43:35.767 --> 00:43:37.308]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:43:38.469 --> 00:43:41.370]  Alright, Ron in New York, thanks for holding your on the air, go ahead.
[00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:44.791]  Hi Alex, getting right on with the topic.
[00:43:45.152 --> 00:43:50.454]  In Monday's New York Sun, there was an article in here about how the City Council in New York City
[00:43:51.488 --> 00:44:01.436]  is just overwhelmed and has this big momentum to try and get foreign nationals, so-called green card holders, to change the law so they could become police officers.
[00:44:01.837 --> 00:44:04.939]  With no further stipulation in that, they could remain police officers.
[00:44:05.019 --> 00:44:11.464]  And listen, look, 20% of our forces in Baghdad were illegal aliens from Mexico.
[00:44:11.965 --> 00:44:12.545]  This is it.
[00:44:12.966 --> 00:44:19.351]  This is the foreign crowd to break up the country, to drive a wedge, and we're going to have our immigrant president, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:44:20.071 --> 00:44:21.452]  And that's what Bush Sr.
[00:44:21.472 --> 00:44:24.374]  said, he said, with the nation now, with all these immigrants?
[00:44:25.014 --> 00:44:30.978]  Alex, if you think it's bad that you have them in the military, even though I don't agree with them in the military, at least two things could be said.
[00:44:32.018 --> 00:44:36.281]  At least theoretically, and for the most part, they're overseas dealing with other foreign nationals.
[00:44:36.561 --> 00:44:38.122]  But literally, these are mercenaries.
[00:44:38.402 --> 00:44:43.025]  And basically, and at least, okay, if they want to go through that to try and get some kind of status,
[00:44:43.866 --> 00:44:44.666]  What can I tell you?
[00:44:44.686 --> 00:44:44.966]  Okay.
[00:44:45.227 --> 00:44:46.027]  More power to them.
[00:44:46.047 --> 00:44:49.408]  No, but now we're going to have the same... Now we're going to have the same... Hold on.
[00:44:49.448 --> 00:44:54.490]  Boston, it came out two years ago, 90%... I just remembered this headline.
[00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.931]  90% of those at the airport weren't even citizens.
[00:44:58.675 --> 00:45:00.015]  Yes, that's true.
[00:45:00.115 --> 00:45:04.056]  And something like 44% were actually illegal aliens.
[00:45:04.497 --> 00:45:05.237]  Yes, that's true.
[00:45:05.457 --> 00:45:07.317]  So these are our ruling class.
[00:45:07.697 --> 00:45:09.938]  The people with the turbines are the rulers.
[00:45:10.218 --> 00:45:15.380]  Then the media tells the middle class, regardless of what color you are, lay down, we're fighting the turbines.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.981]  And then meanwhile, all the real anti-terror training is against gun owners and homeschoolers.
[00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:20.381]  Go ahead.
[00:45:21.081 --> 00:45:27.843]  Well, as I was saying, so now you would have a situation where you would have a foreign national within the borders of the country
[00:45:28.507 --> 00:45:32.590]  With a badge, with a gun, enforcing laws against American citizens.
[00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:33.410]  Could you imagine that?
[00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:36.332]  I actually saw that article, didn't you?
[00:45:36.852 --> 00:45:37.833]  I actually saw that article.
[00:45:38.133 --> 00:45:38.793]  Resend it to me.
[00:45:40.374 --> 00:45:42.315]  I'll have to mail it to you via snail mail.
[00:45:42.375 --> 00:45:43.256]  I don't have an email.
[00:45:43.356 --> 00:45:44.417]  But you did see the article?
[00:45:44.497 --> 00:45:45.757]  Yeah, I saw it.
[00:45:45.838 --> 00:45:47.879]  It's just one more of those things that slipped through.
[00:45:47.899 --> 00:45:51.021]  And every other newscast is how sweet the immigrants are.
[00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:52.522]  And how we're mean to them.
[00:45:52.582 --> 00:45:53.962]  And we need another 30 million.
[00:45:55.063 --> 00:45:55.764]  You know what I like?
[00:45:55.804 --> 00:45:57.225]  Have you ever heard this catchphrase?
[00:45:57.885 --> 00:45:59.346]  It's like a disease or flu.
[00:45:59.426 --> 00:45:59.987]  It goes around.
[00:46:00.327 --> 00:46:01.348]  Well, they're taking jobs.
[00:46:01.388 --> 00:46:02.308]  Americans won't take.
[00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:03.709]  I guess Americans don't work.
[00:46:03.729 --> 00:46:14.217]  There must be 280 million unemployed Americans because if you were to believe this, because we constantly hear it, whether it's about jobs, whether it's about political leadership, we're not capable of doing anything.
[00:46:14.717 --> 00:46:16.219]  We can't even have our own president.
[00:46:16.259 --> 00:46:18.202]  We need an Austrian who admires Hitler.
[00:46:18.222 --> 00:46:24.049]  Yes, and we need foreign officers walking around the streets of America so that they can put a gun to the back of American citizens' heads.
[00:46:24.269 --> 00:46:25.951]  Because we're not capable of doing anything.
[00:46:26.031 --> 00:46:27.993]  And Ron, you've been calling for years.
[00:46:28.013 --> 00:46:29.836]  You're a retired New York City police officer.
[00:46:30.316 --> 00:46:31.057]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:46:31.197 --> 00:46:34.021]  What do your police officer friends think about this?
[00:46:34.761 --> 00:46:35.262]  You know what?
[00:46:35.802 --> 00:46:49.715]  Most, most don't even know, and when I've talked to a few neighbors, just a few local neighbors, the attitude is, oh my, that's terrible, but I gotta get home and see what the Donald is gonna do on TV tonight, or who's winning in the football, you know, who's winning the football game?
[00:46:50.535 --> 00:46:57.720]  I mean, you know, you've got to admit, too, what makes this possible, Alex, is there's a good percentage of American citizens themselves that face it.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.680]  They're low-lifes.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:12.149]  They're low-lifes because if you don't care about the fact that you're going to be subjugated and your children and grandchildren are going to be subjugated by a foreigner who doesn't have your interests at heart at all, then there's something really wrong with your personality or your moral compass.
[00:47:12.689 --> 00:47:16.432]  These people make it possible for quizzling political leaders.
[00:47:16.492 --> 00:47:18.494]  That's what we have in large part in this country.
[00:47:18.874 --> 00:47:21.496]  Facilitators of the takeover and the invasion.
[00:47:21.516 --> 00:47:24.819]  Quizzling political leaders who were born at least in America.
[00:47:24.839 --> 00:47:28.102]  And they're going to build their own foreign armies that are only allied to them.
[00:47:28.723 --> 00:47:29.223]  That's correct.
[00:47:29.243 --> 00:47:29.944]  They're not concerned.
[00:47:30.344 --> 00:47:32.546]  They're not looking at this country like you or I do.
[00:47:32.606 --> 00:47:34.046]  We have a loyalty to our nation.
[00:47:34.407 --> 00:47:36.928]  To them, they're just chasing a transnational bond.
[00:47:36.968 --> 00:47:37.709]  Here's the deal.
[00:47:38.049 --> 00:47:38.609]  Here's the deal.
[00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:45.774]  All the neocons on talk radio talk about is immigration, but then they never point out that Bush is for total open borders and total amnesty.
[00:47:46.034 --> 00:47:48.776]  And I've now heard Hannity actually endorse the amnesty.
[00:47:49.372 --> 00:47:52.116]  Well, I mean, it's insane, people!
[00:47:52.456 --> 00:48:06.415]  The thing that the President has largely dealt with since being re-elected, and I'm sorry if this does offend some really heavy-duty conservatives, the thing he's dealt with since he was re-elected, he's almost occupied his time on, is helping to facilitate
[00:48:07.456 --> 00:48:09.738]  More invasion or intrusion into the country.
[00:48:09.758 --> 00:48:12.600]  He was down in conferences in Latin America for the last few weeks.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:27.434]  No, I know, and appointing pro-abortion, pro-gun control, pro-open border people to everything, and the neocons go, the liberals are attacking Gonzalez, the liberals are attacking Rice, the liberals are attacking... Thanks for the call.
[00:48:29.836 --> 00:48:31.619]  They are.
[00:48:31.659 --> 00:48:34.743]  I appreciate the call.
[00:48:34.763 --> 00:48:35.865]  I mean, it's simple, folks.
[00:48:36.165 --> 00:48:42.294]  When your government brings in foreigners to rule you, you're in Rome, you're in Russia, you're in... I mean, this is just classic.
[00:48:42.334 --> 00:48:44.157]  It's like the British bringing in the German Hessians.
[00:48:45.084 --> 00:48:47.746]  Let's talk to Kyle in California.
[00:48:47.786 --> 00:48:48.526]  Kyle, go ahead.
[00:48:48.546 --> 00:48:51.328]  You're out there in Arnold Land under the Gropen fear.
[00:48:51.848 --> 00:48:54.850]  Oh, I'm right by the Bohemian Grove itself.
[00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:56.291]  Oh, the Christian place.
[00:48:56.631 --> 00:48:58.112]  Oh yeah, the fake Christian place.
[00:48:58.172 --> 00:48:59.813]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:49:00.293 --> 00:49:10.559]  I just want to tell all the people who consider themselves conservatives out there that if you want to examine the evidence, they need to jump ship from the Republican Party because there's nothing conservative about this.
[00:49:11.361 --> 00:49:13.703]  I thought giant government, total loss of freedom.
[00:49:13.723 --> 00:49:15.025]  I thought that's conservative.
[00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:16.566]  No, not for my taste, thanks.
[00:49:17.047 --> 00:49:23.232]  But I wanted to address something that President Bush said about not betting against Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:49:23.313 --> 00:49:24.914]  I don't bet against him.
[00:49:24.934 --> 00:49:25.935]  This is your new president.
[00:49:25.995 --> 00:49:26.676]  Learn to worship.
[00:49:27.076 --> 00:49:31.520]  I do a little internet gambling on sports at a hobby level.
[00:49:32.823 --> 00:49:59.514]  They put up a little internet lines for political things and Arnold was up there for the 2008 Republican representative at 250 to 1 and that thing lasted about three days before they took that line down because I can only imagine after all the TV coverage, just like President Bush was a favorite in the same betting community, these people have insights into
[00:50:00.515 --> 00:50:02.496]  What's going on in the general world?
[00:50:02.516 --> 00:50:04.077]  Oh, the casinos are never wrong.
[00:50:04.698 --> 00:50:06.058]  They say who's going to be president.
[00:50:06.098 --> 00:50:08.060]  They know they're always right.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.861]  And yeah, I didn't know that.
[00:50:10.961 --> 00:50:13.623]  So the gambling houses are saying Arnold's in.
[00:50:13.903 --> 00:50:15.104]  Well, it was a 250 to 1 odd.
[00:50:15.304 --> 00:50:17.705]  So there was a huge underdog.
[00:50:17.745 --> 00:50:27.691]  And that line got pulled off after three days because it's obviously, with the propaganda going on, that they obviously understand that the machine wants this to happen.
[00:50:29.085 --> 00:50:45.698]  Also, I want to, for some of your, I know you've got a conservative base, one thing, you have my PayPal donation, but I want to give props for a hip-hop artist named Immortal Techniques that's discussing a lot of the topics that you discuss.
[00:50:46.078 --> 00:50:50.261]  He's rough around the edges, but for people who enjoy variety... You want to stay with us, Kyle?
[00:50:50.281 --> 00:50:51.042]  You want to stay with us?
[00:50:51.342 --> 00:50:51.782]  Okay, I will.
[00:50:52.002 --> 00:50:54.104]  Alright, we'll be right back with Kyle and Don and others.
[00:50:54.685 --> 00:50:57.707]  And Paul Watson will be joining us from his keep in England.
[00:51:01.387 --> 00:51:05.730]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.911 --> 00:51:10.334]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.474 --> 00:51:14.857]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.897 --> 00:51:16.258]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.058 --> 00:51:17.779]  Hannah Murray.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:18.801]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.978 --> 00:51:33.478]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.064 --> 00:52:06.290]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:14.539]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:21.848]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:22.008 --> 00:52:23.308]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:52:23.368 --> 00:52:29.269]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.449 --> 00:52:34.550]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:43.532]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:43.792 --> 00:52:47.313]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:52:49.193 --> 00:52:53.896]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:55.995]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:05.303 --> 00:54:09.987]  Alright, Don and Jerry and Tim and David, everybody, your calls are coming up here.
[00:54:11.807 --> 00:54:17.073]  I'm told that Jerry disagrees with me, so I'm going to try to go to him after we talk to Kyle here in a second, then to others.
[00:54:17.474 --> 00:54:20.337]  Just briefly, I've made 11 films.
[00:54:20.837 --> 00:54:25.403]  American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004, is out.
[00:54:26.283 --> 00:54:30.989]  And it shows how it was staged from the beginning, how the guys are cousins, skull and bones, Bohemian Grove.
[00:54:32.169 --> 00:54:36.091]  The latest 9-11-11 information, the latest Patriot Act information.
[00:54:36.731 --> 00:54:37.711]  It's a great video.
[00:54:38.491 --> 00:54:40.552]  $19.95 on VHS or DVD.
[00:54:41.192 --> 00:54:47.735]  Each additional DVD to give as a gift, you can get as many as you want, is $5.95 when you buy one at the regular price.
[00:54:48.255 --> 00:54:49.695]  So get a whole bunch of these and give them as gifts.
[00:54:50.175 --> 00:54:55.597]  Also, 9-11 The Road to Tyranny, my premiere 9-11-11 film that covers the whole history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:54:55.617 --> 00:54:56.738]  It is
[00:54:58.141 --> 00:55:00.945]  $24.95 for the almost three hour DVD.
[00:55:01.466 --> 00:55:06.373]  Each additional copy is $5.95 so you can give them as gifts.
[00:55:06.974 --> 00:55:08.136]  A bunch of new specials.
[00:55:08.196 --> 00:55:11.420]  Just go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:12.502]  Peruse the specials.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:18.124]  Order them online via the SecureSafe shopping cart, or call toll-free 1-888-8253-3139.
[00:55:18.144 --> 00:55:18.664]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:55:18.684 --> 00:55:19.065]  Make the call.
[00:55:19.105 --> 00:55:20.446]  Get the films today.
[00:55:20.566 --> 00:55:22.047]  Start spreading the word.
[00:55:22.067 --> 00:55:24.269]  The globalists cannot stand being exposed.
[00:55:35.459 --> 00:55:37.401]  Let's go back to Kyle in California.
[00:55:37.421 --> 00:55:38.482]  Finish up what you were saying, Kyle.
[00:55:38.782 --> 00:55:40.563]  Well, a lot of things, Alex.
[00:55:40.643 --> 00:55:42.825]  I just want to thank you.
[00:55:42.945 --> 00:55:58.838]  I've recently been all through Prison Planet and I saw that you had some new additions with that movie, Outfoxed, which I would totally encourage people to investigate how this media works on our brains and what they're really going for, which is their own ends.
[00:55:59.278 --> 00:56:04.302]  And also I wanted to take the opportunity to call out, because I know you have a lot of Coast to Coast listeners,
[00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:12.976]  And challenge Art Bell to have you on, because I've heard him a number of times, and he has a position where he refuses to acknowledge the facts.
[00:56:13.297 --> 00:56:18.841]  And I think that's the biggest problem that we're facing, is that people are just too afraid to face the facts.
[00:56:18.861 --> 00:56:20.362]  Well, I'd like to go on Art's show.
[00:56:20.402 --> 00:56:21.703]  Thanks for the call, Kyle.
[00:56:22.564 --> 00:56:24.085]  Is it Jerry in Colorado?
[00:56:24.145 --> 00:56:24.986]  Jerry, you're on the air.
[00:56:25.066 --> 00:56:25.446]  Go ahead.
[00:56:26.184 --> 00:56:26.764]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:27.504 --> 00:56:34.406]  I intend to contribute to your Stop Arnold campaign because of what he represents and who he obviously works for.
[00:56:34.826 --> 00:56:41.667]  But where I disagree with you is the argument that part of the problem is his being foreign born.
[00:56:41.727 --> 00:56:46.928]  I couldn't care less where someone's born any more than I care what the color of their skin is.
[00:56:46.948 --> 00:56:49.168]  Here's an example.
[00:56:49.788 --> 00:56:52.269]  I will always be a Texan, no matter where I live.
[00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:54.971]  First and foremost, it's ingrained in the culture.
[00:56:54.991 --> 00:56:57.191]  I mean, this guy's from a foreign country!
[00:56:58.952 --> 00:57:03.133]  And, I mean, you know, my wife's family worked for the Agriculture Department.
[00:57:03.373 --> 00:57:04.874]  They lived in Europe for 15 years.
[00:57:05.114 --> 00:57:07.895]  They said they always felt, first and foremost, to be Americans.
[00:57:08.555 --> 00:57:11.376]  And Arnold, Arnold, but go ahead.
[00:57:11.676 --> 00:57:14.997]  Well, I personally know people, most of us probably do, who
[00:57:16.249 --> 00:57:20.873]  Perhaps came from iron country curtains and have a greater appreciation for what America should be.
[00:57:20.933 --> 00:57:24.976]  Yeah, when you talk to those folks, though, they say that foreigners shouldn't be able to be president.
[00:57:25.196 --> 00:57:29.059]  I mean, imagine trying to go to Russia and run for president as an American.
[00:57:29.319 --> 00:57:37.165]  Well, as an example, if Paul Watson were born in England but moved here and became naturalized, I would have no problem at all voting for him for president.
[00:57:37.205 --> 00:57:42.209]  You know, though, if you let him, then you let everybody else, and I'm against Paul Watson ever running for president.
[00:57:42.769 --> 00:57:44.030]  I really, I just don't see it.
[00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:50.732]  I don't understand why a birthplace really necessarily influences a person's views.
[00:57:51.012 --> 00:57:54.973]  This is a good call from you because this illustrates how they're going to sell it.
[00:57:55.053 --> 00:57:57.914]  You understand, they're going to sell it that it's for all the immigrants.
[00:57:58.314 --> 00:57:59.735]  But it's admittedly for Arnold.
[00:58:00.775 --> 00:58:10.258]  So see, you have to vote against changing the Constitution because, not just because of foreigners, even if you're for that, you have to understand that means it's going to be Arnold, brother.
[00:58:11.094 --> 00:58:17.658]  Well, I do understand that the move to change the Constitution would be designed to benefit his run.
[00:58:18.018 --> 00:58:19.019]  So you oppose that?
[00:58:20.119 --> 00:58:24.302]  No, I do not oppose a foreign-born citizen being a politician in the U.S.
[00:58:24.382 --> 00:58:26.964]  if they've moved here legally and followed all the rules and become elected.
[00:58:26.984 --> 00:58:29.905]  They can be a governor, they can be a senator, they just can't be in the Cabinet.
[00:58:31.681 --> 00:58:32.501]  Right.
[00:58:32.661 --> 00:58:35.742]  To me, it's what they do more than where they're from.
[00:58:36.022 --> 00:58:37.582]  But you understand, this is for Arnold.
[00:58:37.642 --> 00:58:42.503]  Politically, even if you're four foreigners being president, you have to be against this because it's for Arnold, sir.
[00:58:43.104 --> 00:58:45.544]  Well, like I said, I'll be sending you a check for the campaign.
[00:58:45.584 --> 00:58:47.245]  I just disagree with that particular tactic.
[00:58:47.265 --> 00:58:48.425]  Well, I appreciate you, sir.
[00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:49.305]  I get your point.
[00:58:49.325 --> 00:58:55.086]  Thank you.
[00:58:57.627 --> 00:58:58.227]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.932 --> 00:59:00.013]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.713 --> 00:59:01.813]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.473 --> 00:59:03.314]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.034 --> 00:59:05.955]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:09.256]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.796 --> 00:59:13.878]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:25.462 --> 00:59:39.352]  Houston Chronicle today, LA News today, George Herbert Walker gave Lord Schwarzenegger a massive award yesterday, the George Bush Award, reserved for other trash like Gorbachev and others.
[00:59:41.413 --> 00:59:42.594]  And some of the crowd stood up.
[00:59:42.714 --> 00:59:43.875]  One person said, I'm a foreigner.
[00:59:43.915 --> 00:59:45.857]  I'm against foreigners being president.
[00:59:46.817 --> 00:59:50.360]  But Lord Bush said, don't you bet against Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:51.601]  You're looking at your new lord.
[00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:54.843]  Doesn't matter if you're all against it.
[00:59:55.498 --> 00:59:57.219]  Doesn't matter if you're all against NAFTA and GATT.
[00:59:57.239 --> 00:59:59.660]  Doesn't matter if you're all against satellite tracker boxes in your cars.
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:01.721]  You're going to learn to be slaves, scum.
[01:00:03.622 --> 01:00:06.423]  So in your face, it's posted on Infowars.com.
[01:00:06.463 --> 01:00:08.004]  It's going up on ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:00:08.024 --> 01:00:12.025]  And as soon as Paul Watson leaves us, he'll post it on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:13.766 --> 01:00:15.547]  I know we've got people that have been holding patiently.
[01:00:15.567 --> 01:00:16.948]  We'll go to your calls in the next segment.
[01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:19.369]  And that's...
[01:00:21.269 --> 01:00:22.769]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:00:51.242 --> 01:00:53.704]  Paul, what's some of the news you want to cover today?
[01:00:54.645 --> 01:01:02.272]  I think we need to get into the situation in the Ukraine because it's a lot more complex than what we've been led to believe.
[01:01:03.533 --> 01:01:11.039]  And as you mentioned, the euthanization of babies in the Netherlands... Why don't we just send Arnold over to the Ukraine?
[01:01:11.079 --> 01:01:11.780]  He could be their leader.
[01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:21.739]  Well, yeah, but I mean the same people who were behind this push for this so-called pro-Western candidate are the same people behind the push for Arnold.
[01:01:21.799 --> 01:01:23.680]  So, I mean, that would fit with them perfectly.
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.261]  Okay, we'll talk about that.
[01:01:26.281 --> 01:01:30.163]  Want to talk about the NBC piece with Diana saying her boyfriend was killed?
[01:01:32.043 --> 01:01:32.744]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:01:33.644 --> 01:01:35.645]  What else are we going to be talking about?
[01:01:36.483 --> 01:01:38.725]  Uh, the British ID card.
[01:01:39.266 --> 01:01:48.674]  As, uh, obviously the legislation's been announced several pretexts before that legislation was announced to try and kowtow the British public into supporting it.
[01:01:48.694 --> 01:01:49.955]  We need to get into that as well.
[01:01:50.855 --> 01:01:53.057]  Oh, look, the ID card stopped terrorists.
[01:01:53.117 --> 01:01:54.538]  Turns out it was never a threat.
[01:01:54.799 --> 01:01:56.200]  It was another fake alert, but...
[01:01:57.853 --> 01:01:58.854]  Well, yeah, that's the point.
[01:01:58.894 --> 01:02:00.415]  The tactics never change.
[01:02:00.575 --> 01:02:10.002]  Right on the eve of the legislation being announced, we have this so-called Al-Qaeda plot to attack London, which was foiled by the intelligence agencies.
[01:02:10.922 --> 01:02:16.947]  Number one, the intelligence agencies and the special branch police came out and immediately said,
[01:02:17.427 --> 01:02:18.708]  We have no knowledge of this.
[01:02:18.788 --> 01:02:24.453]  There is no evidence to support it, to support the fact that such a plot ever existed or was likely.
[01:02:24.473 --> 01:02:28.016]  But the neocons are still screaming, THEY STOPPED AN AL-QADA ATTACK!
[01:02:28.317 --> 01:02:29.798]  THE JETS WERE ON THE GROUND!
[01:02:30.979 --> 01:02:41.848]  Days later it was admitted that the supposed plot was cooked up over a dinner table by government spinmasters and news executives representing ITN News.
[01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:44.511]  Many of you listeners will recall that
[01:02:45.473 --> 01:02:52.819]  It was ITN News that broadcast the staged Serbian concentration camp footage back in 92.
[01:02:53.259 --> 01:02:59.464]  Which was actually people looking through the barbed wire at the food pantry, protected, because they'd been raiding the food supplies.
[01:03:00.163 --> 01:03:08.726]  Yeah, they filmed the people outside the barbed wire as if they were inside the barbed wire, and they turned what was a refugee center into a death camp.
[01:03:08.766 --> 01:03:15.509]  That'd be like if I went to your warehouse in southern Austin, say, and videotaped a skinny person up against the fence looking in.
[01:03:15.649 --> 01:03:16.429]  Oh, look at him!
[01:03:16.449 --> 01:03:18.570]  Of course, there's a bunch of fat people right next to him.
[01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:19.751]  That guy had tuberculosis.
[01:03:20.031 --> 01:03:21.771]  Look at him, a concentration camp victim.
[01:03:21.971 --> 01:03:25.713]  But the retraction was in the back of the paper, so, Paul, it doesn't exist.
[01:03:25.913 --> 01:03:28.614]  People still argue with me and say, did you see the camp?
[01:03:29.434 --> 01:03:35.659]  Well, there was a big court case which disproved it, but still they held on to the fact that it was true when it's a total fallacy.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.063]  But it gave Clinton the major justification to later, you know, D.U.
[01:03:40.103 --> 01:03:40.943]  bomb Serbia.
[01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:43.125]  Don't talk bad about Clinton liberal.
[01:03:43.805 --> 01:03:44.506]  You're liberal!
[01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:47.068]  Protect Bill Clinton like George Bush has done.
[01:03:47.108 --> 01:03:48.209]  Then you'll be conservative.
[01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:50.951]  We'll be right back with Paul Watson.
[01:03:50.971 --> 01:03:51.872]  Your call is one minute.
[01:03:51.892 --> 01:03:52.212]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:54.719]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:54.899 --> 01:03:58.002]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.122 --> 01:04:02.026]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.086 --> 01:04:06.311]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:10.435]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.515 --> 01:04:12.377]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.977 --> 01:04:15.859]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:04:15.899 --> 01:04:20.622]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.782 --> 01:04:23.823]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.003 --> 01:04:26.865]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.345 --> 01:04:33.469]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.

[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.561]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:05:54.781 --> 01:06:02.127]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:06:02.427 --> 01:06:06.851]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:06:07.111 --> 01:06:16.959]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:21.364]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.

[01:06:24.207 --> 01:06:30.414]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:06:30.674 --> 01:06:32.176]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:06:32.476 --> 01:06:33.378]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:06:33.458 --> 01:06:36.442]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:06:36.602 --> 01:06:37.524]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:06:37.544 --> 01:06:37.724]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:06:37.784 --> 01:06:40.889]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:06:40.909 --> 01:06:41.830]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:06:53.837 --> 01:06:59.461]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:18.373]  Alright, your call for coming up here in just a few minutes, Paul Watson is our guest.
[01:07:19.014 --> 01:07:20.875]  I'm just going to briefly plug my videos.
[01:07:21.952 --> 01:07:26.514]  Because we're only having these super sales for another nineteen and a half days.
[01:07:27.895 --> 01:07:39.340]  It's a special, so instead of giving a fruit pie, or a tie, or some sweater that your family's gonna hate, why not get my DVDs for $5.95 apiece?
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:50.645]  We're offering my newest film, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 04, and we're offering 9-11 The Road to Tyranny, when you buy one of the DVDs,
[01:07:51.383 --> 01:07:54.865]  For the regular price, each additional one is $5.95.
[01:07:58.107 --> 01:08:02.229]  So buy one copy for $19.95 of American Dictators, and each additional is $5.95.
[01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:04.731]  VHS, each additional is $9.95.
[01:08:04.951 --> 01:08:11.835]  Get ten copies, three copies, five copies, give them as gifts.
[01:08:12.596 --> 01:08:13.476]  It's quite a gift.
[01:08:13.596 --> 01:08:16.138]  Instead of just, you're welcome to make copies of my videos too.
[01:08:16.178 --> 01:08:18.759]  Buy one copy and make a thousand copies and give them to people.
[01:08:18.799 --> 01:08:19.800]  Make ten copies, whatever.
[01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:27.837]  But it's a nice gift to give them, you know, the shrink wrap, the color cover, the hard case, the color imprint, you know, on top of the DVD.
[01:08:27.897 --> 01:08:30.299]  People are more apt to watch it and appreciate the gift.
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:34.043]  And $5.95, folks, doesn't get any lower than that.
[01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:36.285]  I've calculated this out.
[01:08:36.305 --> 01:08:40.329]  We make about two bucks, maybe a dollar apiece, $1.50 apiece off each one of these.
[01:08:41.039 --> 01:08:41.900]  After we pay the bills.
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.401]  I don't care about money.
[01:08:43.421 --> 01:08:45.202]  That's why I say make copies of the videos.
[01:08:45.523 --> 01:08:47.284]  The goal is to get the word out.
[01:08:47.364 --> 01:08:55.050]  But yes, when we get your support, I'm able to make more films and have a bigger staff and have better websites and, you know, do things like that.
[01:08:55.911 --> 01:08:58.332]  So the toll free number to get my films, you can call and ask.
[01:08:58.352 --> 01:08:59.613]  We've got four different specials.
[01:09:00.074 --> 01:09:01.855]  No, five different specials going on right now.
[01:09:02.155 --> 01:09:03.636]  Just call and ask about the specials.
[01:09:03.937 --> 01:09:05.458]  If you don't want any of them, just say thank you.
[01:09:06.739 --> 01:09:08.040]  Zero pressure when you call.
[01:09:09.338 --> 01:09:10.939]  I wish there was more pressure, but there's not.
[01:09:10.959 --> 01:09:12.099]  I've got great operators.
[01:09:12.139 --> 01:09:13.380]  They just ask you what you want.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:14.020]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.021]  Give them a call.
[01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:16.141]  888-253-3139.
[01:09:16.421 --> 01:09:17.921]  Or go to InfoWars.com.
[01:09:18.182 --> 01:09:21.383]  And on the secure, safe shopping cart, we have clips of all the films.
[01:09:21.403 --> 01:09:25.304]  In some cases, we have 44 minutes of... That's over a third of American dictators.
[01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:39.849]  Right there on the site where you order it.
[01:09:39.889 --> 01:09:41.090]  You can watch a third of it!
[01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:42.310]  Decide if you want it!
[01:09:45.091 --> 01:09:51.392]  So, Infowars.com, click through to the secure online shopping cart, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:09:51.592 --> 01:09:54.553]  Or write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:09:55.133 --> 01:10:00.374]  Paul Watson, before we go to these calls, and then we'll get into that news, I don't want to make them hold any longer.
[01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:15.092]  Before we do that, Paul, tell folks in 60 seconds about PrisonPlanet.tv, the best subscription deal on the net.
[01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:18.434]  Well, it's $5.95 a month.
[01:10:19.174 --> 01:10:25.136]  We've already got a host of other people's documentary films on there that we got permission to post.
[01:10:25.965 --> 01:10:29.208]  Every single one of Alex Jones's documentary films on there.
[01:10:29.708 --> 01:10:32.191]  Options for dial-up and broadband customers.
[01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:36.274]  Every major audio interview from the Alex Jones Show.
[01:10:37.135 --> 01:10:38.556]  Special text reports.
[01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:40.458]  My book, Order Out of Chaos.
[01:10:40.838 --> 01:10:42.640]  Alex's book, Descent Into Tyranny.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.762]  We're expanding it all the time.
[01:10:45.382 --> 01:10:57.869]  So, I mean, you could get a subscription and cancel it after two weeks if you wanted and, you know, have a chance to watch everything on there as it is for $5.95 a month or get a yearly subscription which works out at $0.15 a day.
[01:10:57.949 --> 01:11:05.773]  So, for the price of basically what amounts to, you know, a cup of coffee a day, it's an excellent deal and it supports us.
[01:11:06.913 --> 01:11:10.295]  Well, you get a week for the price of a cup of coffee.
[01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:12.035]  Well, exactly.
[01:11:12.055 --> 01:11:17.939]  And I mean, people can watch your entire back catalogue of documentary films for $5.95.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.681]  That's basically what we're offering there.
[01:11:20.801 --> 01:11:23.063]  And it's in high bandwidth, low bandwidth.
[01:11:23.143 --> 01:11:28.507]  It's in four different formats, or two different formats, two different bandwidths, four different streams.
[01:11:29.288 --> 01:11:32.971]  I mean, in the high bandwidth, folks, it looks almost like as good as TV.
[01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:34.972]  I mean, it's really crisp.
[01:11:36.033 --> 01:11:38.415]  And PrisonPlanet.tv, okay.
[01:11:39.784 --> 01:11:41.025]  That's a good gift to give, as well.
[01:11:41.065 --> 01:11:43.127]  Paul, how would somebody give this as a gift?
[01:11:44.068 --> 01:11:47.471]  Well, yeah, there's information on that right at the top of the websites right now.
[01:11:47.531 --> 01:12:01.905]  The gift subscription, all you would do is purchase a subscription, then either put the username and password in a card, give that as a gift, or if you live far away from the person, just send them an email saying, here's the username, here's the password,
[01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:03.414]  Go and enjoy it.
[01:12:03.454 --> 01:12:04.456]  So it's very simple.
[01:12:04.496 --> 01:12:14.413]  It's a very cheap gift, but it's an excellent gift because, you know, a kernel of truth can destroy a mountain of lies for people out there, and that's what it's there for.
[01:12:16.002 --> 01:12:22.727]  And we don't authorize people to give their passwords to everyone, because then we have to add more servers, and then, you know, we don't want to have to raise prices.
[01:12:23.207 --> 01:12:26.850]  We've added, what, three more servers in the last few months, because we're not skimping on anything.
[01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:28.911]  We take the money and put it all back into it.
[01:12:29.291 --> 01:12:32.233]  That's why we did this, because we couldn't keep offering videos totally for free.
[01:12:32.334 --> 01:12:33.514]  Most of the videos are still free.
[01:12:33.534 --> 01:12:34.775]  A lot of them are still free.
[01:12:34.795 --> 01:12:39.038]  Just if you want it all in its entirety, sign up, but give yourself a subscription.
[01:12:39.619 --> 01:12:41.040]  And then give a family member.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.581]  I'm going to authorize you.
[01:12:42.621 --> 01:12:44.242]  You can give one family member your codes.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.541]  Give yourself a gift and give them a gift.
[01:12:47.422 --> 01:12:48.643]  It's very simple, folks.
[01:12:49.143 --> 01:12:53.527]  Somebody who's completely computer illiterate, but who knows how to get online.
[01:12:53.547 --> 01:12:55.949]  You just go there and enter your username and password and you're in.
[01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:59.292]  So literally a five-year-old can figure this out.
[01:12:59.812 --> 01:13:06.337]  Okay, let's go to some calls, Paul, and we'll get to all the euthanasia and testing on children and all the horrors we're trying to fight.
[01:13:07.098 --> 01:13:08.459]  Let's talk to Don in Arizona.
[01:13:08.479 --> 01:13:09.360]  Don, thanks for holding.
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:10.180]  You're a real trooper.
[01:13:10.541 --> 01:13:11.001]  How you doing?
[01:13:11.682 --> 01:13:11.822]  Good.
[01:13:12.478 --> 01:13:21.820]  Yeah, you had mentioned earlier about having your callers write in to networks like CNN and such, and talk to them about the Arnold presidency.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.321]  Yeah, tell them you're against it if you're against it!
[01:13:24.461 --> 01:13:27.161]  And say, why is it all wall-to-wall positive reporting?
[01:13:27.442 --> 01:13:41.765]  Well, I used to write CNN pretty regularly, and I had written an artist for CNN, their webpage, who does, usually slamming the Republican Party, does the kind of Democratic view
[01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:46.915]  So I wrote him a message about, you know, skull and bones and all this.
[01:13:47.136 --> 01:13:51.218]  And his response to me, he just wrote me back and said, I am skull and bones.
[01:13:51.858 --> 01:13:54.600]  And threatened to report me to his masters.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:59.043]  And also, and he was like, you know, don't worry.
[01:13:59.103 --> 01:14:03.145]  When we have a one world government, there'll be no hunger, no wars, and so on.
[01:14:03.835 --> 01:14:08.436]  And, you know, so, I mean, basically... Well, they've pulled out all the stops for Arnold.
[01:14:08.476 --> 01:14:10.137]  I mean, he's campaigning right now.
[01:14:10.197 --> 01:14:11.037]  It's wall-to-wall.
[01:14:11.317 --> 01:14:14.918]  And it's a perfect candidacy where he denies it as all his surrogates push it.
[01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:24.561]  From President Bush, former President Bush, to the Senators, Paul Watson comments... Well, surely, you must believe Maria Shriver that he won't run.
[01:14:24.801 --> 01:14:26.921]  I mean, that's Cath's dying guarantee, isn't it?
[01:14:26.941 --> 01:14:28.922]  It's like she said he wasn't going to run for Governor.
[01:14:29.182 --> 01:14:32.223]  And she says, well, we're going to amend the Constitution, but not for my husband.
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.163]  Fox News did a report on it yesterday.
[01:14:36.803 --> 01:14:37.524]  Lavish!
[01:14:37.844 --> 01:14:39.106]  Fair and balanced.
[01:14:39.406 --> 01:14:45.372]  Obviously the entire article was focused on the pro-amendment constitution.
[01:14:45.472 --> 01:14:48.295]  And how good it is, and how reasonable it is.
[01:14:48.315 --> 01:14:55.443]  Yeah, I mean it reads, you know, more than 200 years later in a diverse nation with more than 33 million immigrants.
[01:14:56.204 --> 01:15:03.507]  And the entire article is couched in this positive and kind of inevitable mindset that this is going to happen.
[01:15:03.607 --> 01:15:07.329]  So, everybody should jump on the bandwagon and support it.
[01:15:07.529 --> 01:15:12.371]  But there's obviously no mention of Americans against Arnold because, you know, Fox News is fair and balanced.
[01:15:12.391 --> 01:15:13.411]  Then they mention a CNN poll.
[01:15:13.671 --> 01:15:15.672]  Ooh, a few weeks ago it was 80% against.
[01:15:16.032 --> 01:15:18.033]  Now only 58% are against Arnold.
[01:15:19.073 --> 01:15:19.253]  Ooh!
[01:15:20.294 --> 01:15:25.736]  Yeah, about two months ago it was kind of 98% the AOL poll, which they did.
[01:15:26.351 --> 01:15:30.755]  Well, that's good news, but it shows you that the propaganda with this push for the amendment is
[01:15:44.341 --> 01:15:49.405]  Due to the widespread coverage in the... They're just basting us in it, getting us acclimated.
[01:15:49.585 --> 01:15:50.946]  Go ahead, finish up, Don.
[01:15:51.327 --> 01:16:02.335]  Yeah, well, if they're going to amend the Constitution to allow Arnold Schwarzenegger to run for President, then foreign nationals from all over the world should start campaigning now to run for President.
[01:16:02.536 --> 01:16:03.737]  It's not a joke!
[01:16:04.137 --> 01:16:06.639]  Former President Bush said, hey, don't bet against Arnold.
[01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:07.780]  It's not a joke.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:08.761]  Thanks for the call.
[01:16:09.842 --> 01:16:10.582]  Good to hear from you.
[01:16:10.642 --> 01:16:11.463]  Tim in Texas.
[01:16:11.483 --> 01:16:12.283]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:16:12.344 --> 01:16:12.744]  Go ahead.
[01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:33.040]  Yeah, Alex, when I was in graduate school in 1988, there was a government program that was bringing over biomedical scientists from Communist China at government expense and paying to train these people and then send them back to Communist China, if you can believe that.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:39.223]  All of my classmates... You're talking about in genetic engineering or bio-level stuff?
[01:16:40.074 --> 01:16:42.956]  Well, it was basically in biomedical science.
[01:16:43.056 --> 01:16:46.377]  I mean, in my case, it was physiology and biophysics.
[01:16:47.078 --> 01:16:55.182]  But in this program, I had gotten into this program where all the expenses and fees were paid for by the NIH.
[01:16:55.382 --> 01:16:56.683]  Well, you know why that is, sir?
[01:16:57.043 --> 01:17:00.805]  Because our government, the UN, pays them to have forced abortions and the rest of it.
[01:17:01.045 --> 01:17:04.727]  And so our government, our Christian government, pays to have China do this.
[01:17:04.767 --> 01:17:05.067]  Go ahead.
[01:17:05.635 --> 01:17:16.364]  Well, it was just amazing to me because all of my classmates were Communist Chinese and I said to the people, the administrators, I said, well, why is it that all of my classmates are from Communist China?
[01:17:16.384 --> 01:17:20.467]  And they said, oh, well, there weren't any Americans that were qualified except you.
[01:17:20.487 --> 01:17:24.530]  I'm just looking at this.
[01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:31.976]  I had been out of college for ten years when I went back and, you know, you cannot convince me that there weren't
[01:17:32.552 --> 01:18:01.333]  Let me tell you something, you go to UT, in almost every class there's 200 people, it's a foreigner, doesn't speak a word of English, they don't teach you anything, and that foreigner is there to talk to the group of foreigners, they're usually Chinese, or Indian, and it'll either be an Indian or Chinese class, they even set it up that way, and there'll be maybe two Hispanics, five white people, one black person, and everybody else is a foreigner, and they have the foreign teacher there for them, and this is the new world order for you!
[01:18:01.997 --> 01:18:03.358]  Yeah, it's just amazing.
[01:18:04.239 --> 01:18:05.980]  The government was paying for this.
[01:18:07.742 --> 01:18:10.544]  Well, that's why when I was sitting there in college, I was making good grades.
[01:18:10.584 --> 01:18:11.625]  I said, I'm out of here, folks.
[01:18:11.685 --> 01:18:12.906]  I'm not going to sit here and put up with this.
[01:18:12.946 --> 01:18:19.111]  I'm not going to sit here and pay all this money to be taught by someone who doesn't even speak English.
[01:18:20.592 --> 01:18:22.014]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:18:22.574 --> 01:18:24.576]  Okay, Alex, well that's what I wanted to tell you.
[01:18:24.996 --> 01:18:29.360]  Well, so I would imagine if that was back in the 80s, it's probably a lot worse now, huh?
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:30.641]  Oh yeah, I'm sure it is.
[01:18:31.198 --> 01:18:33.500]  Well, what do you think about Lord Arnold for president?
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.581]  He's... Lord Barton says it's inevitable.
[01:18:36.442 --> 01:18:38.463]  This is disgusting tandering.
[01:18:38.483 --> 01:18:43.727]  Listen, I gotta catch the door, but I'll catch the rescue show.
[01:18:43.747 --> 01:18:44.908]  Alright, good to hear from you, man.
[01:18:45.248 --> 01:18:49.731]  We'll be back with more calls in Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:18:49.751 --> 01:18:50.192]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.388 --> 01:18:56.870]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[01:18:57.130 --> 01:19:00.631]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:19:00.731 --> 01:19:04.673]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:19:04.913 --> 01:19:11.056]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:19:11.456 --> 01:19:19.380]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.520]  We're good to go.
[01:19:34.707 --> 01:19:35.427]  That's triple eight!
[01:19:35.447 --> 01:19:35.487]  803-4438.
[01:19:35.527 --> 01:19:36.188]  Protect your family.
[01:19:52.631 --> 01:19:54.093]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[01:19:54.413 --> 01:19:58.998]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:19:59.338 --> 01:20:01.681]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:20:01.901 --> 01:20:03.422]  Achieve financial independence.
[01:20:03.803 --> 01:20:08.908]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:10.430]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:13.193]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[01:20:13.573 --> 01:20:20.297]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering a 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[01:20:27.481 --> 01:20:32.624]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[01:20:33.124 --> 01:20:38.629]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:40.671]  Get the map.

[01:20:47.556 --> 01:20:50.679]  Get your Red Book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[01:20:52.026 --> 01:20:55.608]  Every hour of every day, someone out there is suffering from hemorrhoids.
[01:20:55.908 --> 01:20:58.409]  The pain, worry, and embarrassment can be devastating.

[01:21:07.213 --> 01:21:10.155]  My husband had been suffering from a painful hemorrhoid for years.
[01:21:10.515 --> 01:21:13.216]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[01:21:13.556 --> 01:21:17.318]  I ordered HEMTAB online, and soon after taking HEMTAB, the pain was gone.
[01:21:17.558 --> 01:21:19.459]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[01:21:19.779 --> 01:21:20.219]  Miracle?
[01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:21.599]  Hem Miracle, we call it.

[01:21:49.225 --> 01:21:51.365]  Hemtab, the effective alternative.
[01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:54.346]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:54.406 --> 01:21:56.808]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[01:21:57.168 --> 01:21:58.049]  Let me rephrase that.
[01:21:58.409 --> 01:21:59.630]  Oil War III has started.
[01:21:59.930 --> 01:22:02.371]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[01:22:02.792 --> 01:22:06.174]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[01:22:06.574 --> 01:22:07.455]  Why else would the U.S.
[01:22:07.475 --> 01:22:10.437]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[01:22:10.697 --> 01:22:11.938]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[01:22:12.418 --> 01:22:16.881]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[01:22:17.321 --> 01:22:21.284]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[01:22:21.824 --> 01:22:27.726]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[01:22:27.966 --> 01:22:34.068]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[01:22:34.589 --> 01:22:35.169]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:40.831]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[01:22:41.271 --> 01:22:43.632]  That's 1-800-453-2202 or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[01:22:43.672 --> 01:22:43.992]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.701]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:57.201 --> 01:23:00.501]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.902 --> 01:23:21.005]  Alright, more of your calls are coming up in the next segment, but Paul, let's go ahead and get into what's really going on over in the Ukraine.
[01:23:22.327 --> 01:23:30.377]  And then I want to get into some of the euthanasia and testing chemicals and things on foster children that's now coming out in a lot of the big newspapers.
[01:23:30.978 --> 01:23:32.300]  But let's get into the Ukraine first.
[01:23:33.112 --> 01:23:38.496]  Well, yeah, the latest on that is that the Parliament voted today to sack the Government, basically.
[01:23:39.176 --> 01:23:48.762]  So, it's necessary to fill people in on the fact that this isn't a black and white situation, and it's not some kind of spontaneous popular uprising.
[01:23:49.503 --> 01:23:54.146]  Because all you need to do is look at the money and the influencers behind each candidate.
[01:23:54.801 --> 01:24:02.773]  And in the article on PrisonPlanet.com, I characterized it as a tug-of-war turf battle between two crime empires.
[01:24:03.334 --> 01:24:09.504]  So this is not to say that we support the KGB-run dictatorship of Vladimir Putin.
[01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:13.852]  Because there's been vote fraud and intimidation on both sides.
[01:24:14.233 --> 01:24:23.339]  The supposed poisoning of Yushchenko was a carefully constructed ploy to implant this suggestion of foul play.
[01:24:23.879 --> 01:24:39.129]  Now, obviously, Yushchenko has some kind of illness, but the doctor who did the test and came out publicly to say it wasn't poisoning, after being threatened to say the opposite, subsequently had a bomb placed outside his house, so that kind of
[01:24:39.873 --> 01:24:42.175]  Directs you as to who is pushing that idea.
[01:24:42.635 --> 01:24:54.265]  But the bankrolling of the so-called pro-Western candidate Yushchenko can be traced back to George Soros, IMF and World Bank money.
[01:24:55.003 --> 01:25:15.554]  Which is basically what they've been doing across these Russian satellite countries for the past few years, throwing out fairly elected government by staging phony uprisings because the government are not 100% behind submerging their countries into the subdivisions of this regional world government.
[01:25:16.865 --> 01:25:40.590]  The Bush administration and the neocons that have come out as being firmly behind Yushchenko, which begs the question, if George Soros is supposedly Bush's archenemy in light of the fact that he funded the left-wing opposition to him before the election, why are they pulling the same rope in the same direction in this election?
[01:25:40.730 --> 01:25:44.491]  Well, they also both support a weak dollar, and
[01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:48.009]  Absolutely, it's totally staged.
[01:25:48.049 --> 01:25:48.450]  Go ahead.
[01:25:49.550 --> 01:26:00.158]  Yeah, if this represents the biggest split between East and West since the Cold War, as we're being told, then it's 100 times more important than which Skull and Bones member got in the White House.
[01:26:00.498 --> 01:26:13.848]  So it underscores a point which we make often, and that is that on the major social and geopolitical issues, there is no real split between the neo-consul, so-called right globalist, and the liberal, so-called left-wing globalist.
[01:26:14.882 --> 01:26:31.639]  You could make the argument that the split between Russia and the US was being orchestrated on a higher level to bring the European Union block to the fore as the emerging superpower, which isn't something that you can pull out of thin air, as you mentioned.
[01:26:31.659 --> 01:26:34.201]  This is part of why they're slowly crashing the dollar.
[01:26:34.702 --> 01:26:39.126]  And in fact, Russia's top political scientist came out last week and said the same thing.
[01:26:39.927 --> 01:26:48.492]  So the bottom line is that this is a far more complex issue than the spontaneous popular uprising that we've been fed by the media.
[01:26:49.093 --> 01:26:54.816]  Meanwhile, Bush and Putin are best buddies and they both carry out terror attacks to blame on their political enemies.
[01:26:55.577 --> 01:27:08.765]  Yeah, so it's basically infighting on that level, but on a wider level you could argue that it was designed to get Russia and the US at each other's throats over this issue and kind of resurrect the Iron Curtain.
[01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:15.123]  Because, I mean, George Soros is behind it, and George Bush is behind it, and they're supposedly enemies, so how do we vote that one out?
[01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:21.910]  Well, it's true, and poll at the same time now, if they've thrown out the election, I guess they're going to have another election.
[01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:24.132]  That seems to be the way it's heading.
[01:27:26.267 --> 01:27:31.731]  As has happened in other countries which George Soros has been involved with, in both influence and money.
[01:27:31.931 --> 01:27:39.477]  And in fact they had all the set up for the stage protest before even the election result had been announced.
[01:27:40.077 --> 01:27:42.719]  So in places like Belarus that's exactly what happened.
[01:27:42.739 --> 01:27:48.023]  They had another election and the pro-globalist, the more pro-globalist candidate won.
[01:27:48.083 --> 01:27:51.726]  So that seems to be an exact replica in this situation.
[01:27:52.455 --> 01:27:55.220]  Of course, George Soros has been living in America for decades.
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:58.326]  He could be our new president, too, after Arnold, maybe, or something.
[01:27:59.448 --> 01:28:00.751]  Well, yeah, anyone could be.
[01:28:00.891 --> 01:28:02.675]  That's way up, you know, Hell's Gate.
[01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:04.645]  It is.
[01:28:04.665 --> 01:28:18.371]  When we get back, New York's guinea pig kids, BBC, HIV positive children and their loved ones, have few rights if they choose to battle the social work authorities in New York City, and they admit they test deadly experimental drugs on them.
[01:28:18.411 --> 01:28:22.893]  Also another article about testing pesticides on foster children.
[01:28:24.073 --> 01:28:26.674]  And then another article here about euthanizing babies.
[01:28:28.035 --> 01:28:31.376]  I want to get into this when we return, Paul, and then into some of the calls.
[01:28:32.225 --> 01:28:39.734]  We'll also cover new information on NBC about Princess Diana saying that her boyfriend was murdered.
[01:28:40.735 --> 01:28:43.097]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:43.638 --> 01:28:44.559]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.641]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.563 --> 01:28:50.246]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:01.862]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[01:29:02.242 --> 01:29:06.924]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[01:29:07.144 --> 01:29:10.985]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:14.186]  Super Silver is a combination of supercharged silver and oxygen.
[01:29:14.486 --> 01:29:21.333]  has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[01:29:21.613 --> 01:29:30.142]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[01:29:30.482 --> 01:29:36.869]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[01:29:53.613 --> 01:29:57.176]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.236 --> 01:29:57.737]  are located?
[01:29:57.937 --> 01:30:01.319]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[01:30:55.364 --> 01:31:00.246]  There is a tremendous price for among the major term life companies and you may be paying too much.
[01:31:00.366 --> 01:31:01.826]  Consider these possible rates.
[01:31:02.266 --> 01:31:06.728]  A man, age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1,000,000 of coverage is only $75 per month.
[01:31:06.748 --> 01:31:07.608]  Level for the next 10 years.
[01:31:11.409 --> 01:31:18.334]  Or a man age 50, non-tobacco user issue preferred, can obtain $500,000 of coverage for a monthly premium of only $113.
[01:31:20.056 --> 01:31:22.397]  Guaranteed not to change for the next 20 years.
[01:31:22.738 --> 01:31:23.318]  That's right!
[01:31:23.658 --> 01:31:26.300]  Guaranteed level rates for the next 20 years.
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:29.443]  If you're a smoker, there are great rates available for you as well.
[01:31:29.923 --> 01:31:30.043]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:00.142]  Waging War on Corruption.
[01:32:00.603 --> 01:32:03.466]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:09.812 --> 01:32:20.824]  Wesley Smith, a writer for the Wall Street Journal, has done dozens, scores, of articles listing people by name who
[01:32:21.878 --> 01:32:27.000]  Signed off and said, oh, you know, don't, don't give me aid if I'm incapacitated.
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:29.861]  They didn't know that meant, they thought that meant brain dead.
[01:32:29.881 --> 01:32:35.383]  They didn't know that meant if they were paralyzed, neck down, begging, I mean, audibly, food, water, please help me.
[01:32:35.643 --> 01:32:36.723]  They actually killed them!
[01:32:37.503 --> 01:32:39.484]  And we've listed their names and posted the articles.
[01:32:40.504 --> 01:32:45.406]  And then other cases get attention, like Terry Schiavo Schindler.
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:54.185]  Who could open her eyes and smile and stuff, and years ago could even eat, but her husband won't allow her to have food or water, only intravenously.
[01:32:56.166 --> 01:33:01.490]  And so she is, you know, it's been an ongoing fight, but this case is much more obvious.
[01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:04.472]  I mean, where people are openly begging for food.
[01:33:06.233 --> 01:33:10.456]  And they just shut them down and don't give them water and watch them die.
[01:33:11.056 --> 01:33:12.457]  Bunch of articles about that.
[01:33:13.821 --> 01:33:20.623]  And then in the Netherlands, where people actually put tattoos on their feet now, or wear special cards saying, don't kill me!
[01:33:21.643 --> 01:33:24.183]  Because of the socialized system where we shouldn't have to pay for you.
[01:33:24.203 --> 01:33:33.265]  I mean, all the articles where they kill people, don't give them treatment, who could be saved because they want their organs, or people who said no on the organ donor card, they still take their organs.
[01:33:34.666 --> 01:33:36.406]  Most hospitals take your retinas.
[01:33:37.057 --> 01:33:43.039]  Paul Watson, this article out of ABC News, Netherlands hospital euthanizes babies and they're proud of it.
[01:33:43.279 --> 01:33:44.579]  They're bragging about it, Paul.
[01:33:45.479 --> 01:33:50.240]  Well, yeah, it's another example of something that you can apply to almost anything with government.
[01:33:50.981 --> 01:33:56.242]  If there's a so-called debate about whether it should be done, you can bet that the government is already doing it.
[01:33:57.872 --> 01:34:03.955]  It's basically the cradle-to-grave state involvement in parenting which continues to lurch forward.
[01:34:04.676 --> 01:34:10.599]  We had a high-profile case here in Britain recently where a baby was on a life support machine.
[01:34:10.619 --> 01:34:13.420]  The parents were hopeful that the baby would survive.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:17.682]  They were getting independent medical advice saying that there was a good chance that it would survive.
[01:34:18.422 --> 01:34:20.083]  But there was a court case.
[01:34:20.123 --> 01:34:23.705]  The judge said no and the baby was killed and the government was behind it.
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:31.224]  And again, our government, the western government, write the policy for China, give them awards.
[01:34:31.484 --> 01:34:32.484]  They are the model.
[01:34:32.804 --> 01:34:36.326]  And Bush has increased funding for forced abortion, everything.
[01:34:36.827 --> 01:34:38.127]  Folks, this is going on.
[01:34:38.928 --> 01:34:39.268]  Go ahead.
[01:34:40.054 --> 01:34:46.998]  Yeah, Bush took away $34 million from one abortion agency, gave $300 million to another.
[01:34:47.018 --> 01:34:48.379]  So, I mean, that's very consistent.
[01:34:48.399 --> 01:34:51.320]  That was in one funding mechanism, was actually over $800 million.
[01:34:52.281 --> 01:35:05.929]  But, at the same time, here in Britain, you've got Blair's Minister for Children, which is a well-known title within itself, stating, quote, for me, it's not a question of whether we should intrude in family life, but how and when.
[01:35:06.804 --> 01:35:13.171]  And the abortion peddlers here in Britain, the major organizations, akin to Planned Parenthood.
[01:35:13.732 --> 01:35:15.934]  Hold on, are you some kind of liberal against abortion?
[01:35:16.255 --> 01:35:17.016]  You communist.
[01:35:17.817 --> 01:35:19.779]  You're probably against gun control too, you commie.
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:22.442]  So we've got to learn the new double thing, Paul.
[01:35:23.371 --> 01:35:25.352]  I know, I've got to learn the neocon double thing.
[01:35:25.832 --> 01:35:26.713]  Exactly, good.
[01:35:28.734 --> 01:35:44.962]  The equivalent of Planned Parenthood are pushing for legal termination to be extended up to 24 weeks, when the recent scientific studies using the latest technology tell us that babies are smiling and showing clear signs of intelligence in the womb after 9, 10 weeks.
[01:35:45.142 --> 01:35:46.722]  Well, that's in England.
[01:35:46.743 --> 01:35:49.604]  Here in the US, you can kill a baby the day before it's born.
[01:35:50.791 --> 01:35:51.031]  Yes.
[01:35:51.151 --> 01:35:51.572]  I understand.
[01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:58.877]  These are babies that you can just take out, give up for adoption, in a procedure, or let the baby be born instead.
[01:35:58.897 --> 01:36:00.739]  I mean, they butcher them the day before.
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:03.961]  And I mean, just look what's happening elsewhere in the world.
[01:36:03.981 --> 01:36:05.322]  We had an article out of the mosque.
[01:36:05.382 --> 01:36:06.163]  Let me just stop you.
[01:36:06.543 --> 01:36:16.091]  Folks, do you think, I apologize, do you think you're safe living in a country or in a world where they kill babies, where our government funds forcing women to have abortions?
[01:36:17.914 --> 01:36:18.856]  You think you're safe?
[01:36:18.876 --> 01:36:20.500]  You think you're going to be okay?
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.506]  You think this government likes you and wouldn't kill 3,000 of you on 9-11?
[01:36:23.526 --> 01:36:23.887]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:36:26.641 --> 01:36:29.663]  Well, this is what the so-called choice leads to every time.
[01:36:29.683 --> 01:36:37.248]  The right to die and the right of choice often veils underneath of which lies the... Government's choice to kill you, yeah.
[01:36:37.648 --> 01:36:41.030]  Yeah, and to pseudo-legalize murder is basically what it is.
[01:36:41.451 --> 01:36:47.735]  You have 25-year-old women in Russia having 30 abortions and saying, so what?
[01:36:48.756 --> 01:36:53.839]  The article we carried out of China... Which makes their cancer rate just explode.
[01:36:55.109 --> 01:37:07.616]  Yeah, the woman out of China, she had two children to protest the one-child policy and a week later she was being tortured by having her limbs pulled apart, being forced to say the opposite.
[01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:14.760]  But where does this mentality of sexual promiscuity which has led to all this trace back to?
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:20.403]  It's the Rockefeller-funded, inspiration of Playboy magazine, Kinsey Reports.
[01:37:21.581 --> 01:37:44.280]  Alfred Kinsey, the practicing paedophile, who abused children, even his own children, and used research from Nazis to proclaim that aberrant sexual behavior, which leads to a lot of these teenage pregnancies, was normal and to be encouraged, which of course opened the gates of health to AIDS, abortion, disease, child abuse, family breakdown, you name it.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:50.841]  And so now, 50 years later, Hollywood again celebrates this, and it's a box office hit.
[01:37:50.861 --> 01:38:00.503]  So the foundations of this, which was sponsored and funded by government, lead directly back to that practicing pedophile by the name of Alfred Kinsey.
[01:38:02.904 --> 01:38:04.444]  Oh, you're a liberal, shut up!
[01:38:05.344 --> 01:38:06.485]  Bush cares about us.
[01:38:07.125 --> 01:38:08.845]  New York's Gimme Eat Pig Kids.
[01:38:08.865 --> 01:38:13.386]  This is old news, but we've got articles about testing deadly AIDS drugs on children.
[01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:22.241]  They come to families, take one child and say, let us test these new serotonin uptake inhibitors, or we'll take your other child.
[01:38:22.261 --> 01:38:28.671]  I mean, we've read these for years, but now I've got an article about them testing, the FDA testing pesticides.
[01:38:29.443 --> 01:38:43.057]  Because you know, it's supposedly unethical to even pay somebody to do this, but hey, when you've got all these CPS-grabbed kids, HIV-positive children and their loved ones have few rights if they choose to battle with social work authorities in New York City, and it's admitted it's the drugs that kill the kids.
[01:38:43.477 --> 01:38:51.845]  Jacqueline Hoger's job was to treat children with HIV at the New York Children's Home, but nobody had told her that the drugs she was administering were experimental and highly toxic.
[01:38:52.266 --> 01:38:52.866]  You were told they were
[01:38:53.707 --> 01:39:01.089]  Vomiting, if they lost their ability to walk, if they were having diarrhea, if they were dying, then all of this was because of their HIV infection.
[01:39:01.569 --> 01:39:03.390]  In fact, it was the drugs they were making.
[01:39:03.930 --> 01:39:10.272]  The children ill and the children had been enrolled on a secret trials without their relatives or guardians knowledge.
[01:39:11.472 --> 01:39:19.395]  Now again, my dad in college worked at MD Anderson Cancer Research Facility and people who were dying of terminal cancer would sign over their rights
[01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:21.690]  You know, to have experimental tests done.
[01:39:21.710 --> 01:39:23.551]  And there's a lot of this stuff that would just kill them instantly.
[01:39:23.571 --> 01:39:24.711]  But, you know, they were signing over.
[01:39:24.771 --> 01:39:25.352]  They were old.
[01:39:25.432 --> 01:39:26.512]  It was a chance they had.
[01:39:26.852 --> 01:39:27.553]  Some of it helped them.
[01:39:27.833 --> 01:39:30.054]  But with this, they just grab your kid and do it, Paul.
[01:39:30.094 --> 01:39:30.834]  But it's not just this.
[01:39:30.894 --> 01:39:33.115]  It's pesticides.
[01:39:33.696 --> 01:39:34.536]  It's other drugs.
[01:39:34.576 --> 01:39:36.437]  Just on healthy children they grab, Paul.
[01:39:36.457 --> 01:39:38.318]  That's been in the New York News for years.
[01:39:38.358 --> 01:39:40.679]  But it's going on countrywide, Paul.
[01:39:41.681 --> 01:39:50.353]  Well, yeah, and for the better part of a decade in the major metropolitan areas, the policy has been no vaccines, no school.
[01:39:50.893 --> 01:39:52.696]  And so, well, you say, OK, I'll homeschool.
[01:39:52.716 --> 01:39:55.620]  Well, you're a terrorist, because now the homeschoolers are the terrorists.
[01:39:56.781 --> 01:39:58.181]  Well yeah, and here's the point.
[01:40:22.347 --> 01:40:24.108]  How many people are going to refuse that?
[01:40:24.208 --> 01:40:26.249]  Take the example of the British ID card.
[01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:32.652]  If 1% of the population of 60 million people refuse to take it, then what are they going to do?
[01:40:32.712 --> 01:40:34.913]  Put 600,000 people in jail?
[01:40:35.294 --> 01:40:36.474]  Same with New Freedom.
[01:40:36.494 --> 01:40:43.438]  If 1% of American parents reject that, you know, how many people in America... But Paul, why are you against New Freedom?
[01:40:43.498 --> 01:40:44.018]  It's freedom!
[01:40:46.546 --> 01:40:49.008]  It's just like victory gin and all the rest of it.
[01:40:49.149 --> 01:40:50.510]  I need to learn the double think.
[01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:53.734]  Well look, I mean, we taught Hitler about eugenics.
[01:40:53.774 --> 01:40:55.055]  The British and the Americans did.
[01:40:55.075 --> 01:40:57.898]  He gave awards to Sanger, got awards from her.
[01:40:58.619 --> 01:41:01.702]  Hundreds of thousands, 300 plus thousand women were sterilized from 1920 to 1985.
[01:41:04.989 --> 01:41:06.450]  They would have medical students do it.
[01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:10.853]  They would just grab a woman, and they did it to retarded people, but not just poor retarded folks.
[01:41:11.313 --> 01:41:14.716]  They would grab somebody who was from a single-parent home who had under a B+.
[01:41:15.276 --> 01:41:16.277]  That's mainstream news.
[01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:19.359]  They'd have medical students literally cut their uterus out.
[01:41:20.112 --> 01:41:22.294]  And, uh, this is the type of stuff they're into, folks.
[01:41:22.314 --> 01:41:28.160]  The UN funds this worldwide right now, with chemical sterilization going on, and they want IMF World Bank money.
[01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:32.124]  We got Kissinger's documents on this, declassified in 92, from 73.
[01:41:32.584 --> 01:41:37.989]  Uh, so this is your government, so keep, just, your vaccines are good, just trust them.
[01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:39.851]  Fluoride is good, just trust them.
[01:41:40.252 --> 01:41:42.894]  Mercury in the vaccines is good for you, just trust them.
[01:41:43.054 --> 01:41:43.495]  Right, Paul?
[01:41:44.358 --> 01:41:48.561]  Well yeah, the definition of mental health, as he mentioned, under a B+.
[01:41:49.702 --> 01:41:52.944]  The Soviet method is anyone who criticizes the government.
[01:41:53.424 --> 01:41:56.506]  And that's how it started in Nazi Germany, when it was passed over.
[01:41:56.646 --> 01:42:02.170]  We've had psychiatrists and psychologists on, they have created multiple new mental illnesses.
[01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:08.654]  Oppositional Authority Disorder, all this, where you don't like giving up your rights, you are mentally ill.
[01:42:10.006 --> 01:42:14.829]  Well yeah, because they use the psychological tests of people who don't obey authority.
[01:42:15.269 --> 01:42:22.414]  They try and portray that as a natural human trait, obeying authority no matter how abusive that authority is.
[01:42:22.474 --> 01:42:26.336]  So if you go against that at whatever level, then it's a sign of mental disorder.
[01:42:27.246 --> 01:42:32.409]  The very first case in Nazi Germany which led to the Holocaust was a child who was mentally handicapped.
[01:42:33.049 --> 01:42:36.911]  The parent wrote to Hitler, said, I want my child killed.
[01:42:36.991 --> 01:42:40.573]  Gave Hitler the idea, the genesis for the birth of the Holocaust.
[01:42:40.653 --> 01:42:44.154]  And this is what we see emerging in the so-called developed world now.
[01:42:45.215 --> 01:42:46.676]  Yeah, that was the Nazi PR.
[01:42:46.716 --> 01:42:49.857]  The people were calling for, in reality, it was all Sanger handbooks.
[01:42:50.818 --> 01:42:54.219]  But I got stacks of these here, Paul.
[01:42:56.559 --> 01:42:59.541]  Don't understand, people are so self-centered.
[01:43:00.021 --> 01:43:06.204]  Don't the yuppies and everybody understand that I know you want to see, as a listener said, what Donald Trump will be doing tonight.
[01:43:07.105 --> 01:43:14.389]  I know you've got more important things to do, but why do you let your child eat three candy bars, drink two cokes, and eat the garbage at school?
[01:43:14.429 --> 01:43:20.192]  Why do you let them, when they bounce off the walls, go on Ritalin, which causes all sorts of health problems, death admittedly,
[01:43:20.848 --> 01:43:26.051]  Why do you put 15% of the children on Prozac-type drugs?
[01:43:26.691 --> 01:43:28.632]  Why do you people go along with this?
[01:43:28.712 --> 01:43:33.474]  I mean, I just... And Paul, it's getting worse and worse and worse.
[01:43:33.775 --> 01:43:35.295]  I mean, they're dismantling.
[01:43:36.076 --> 01:43:38.877]  You talk about everybody you know over in England's lost all their good jobs.
[01:43:38.957 --> 01:43:39.718]  It's happened here.
[01:43:40.358 --> 01:43:42.079]  Our industrial base is disappearing.
[01:43:42.999 --> 01:43:44.580]  Our currency here is plunging.
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:47.902]  Our sovereignty is ending next year with the Pan-American Union.
[01:43:49.090 --> 01:43:53.851]  I'm not trying to be negative here, it's just... comments.
[01:43:54.931 --> 01:44:01.212]  Well, Hitler said, you know, something akin to, once you've got the women and children, so follow the men.
[01:44:01.713 --> 01:44:13.735]  You pick on the most defenseless individual, which is the baby, the child, and then basically there's no defense against anything because it removes forcibly that natural instinct to protect the defenseless.
[01:44:14.395 --> 01:44:16.617]  Which is why, as you said, that's the mentality.
[01:44:17.138 --> 01:44:38.236]  Do you believe that your government would not have killed 3,000 people on 9-11, when, you know, there's how many abortions a day, something in the... And now these CPS workers are quitting and freaking out, going, the children were dying, we were giving them drugs and we're killing them, they told us, I've killed children, I've killed them, and that's somebody with a soul, I've killed them, I'm killing...
[01:44:38.816 --> 01:44:52.993]  It's like that W-O-A-I-TV piece two weeks ago, three weeks ago, where it said the average child is on seven drugs, over two-thirds of foster children in Texas are on drugs, over two-thirds, and a lot of them are on 17 different drugs, Paul.
[01:44:53.013 --> 01:44:54.094]  They're dying!
[01:44:54.475 --> 01:44:56.137]  They're killing children!
[01:44:56.844 --> 01:45:00.506]  And then they have complete control of the adoption system.
[01:45:01.026 --> 01:45:11.010]  If you do have these teenage pregnancies which are fuelled by this sexual permissiveness promoted by Hollywood and the media, then there's the option of the adoption system.
[01:45:11.050 --> 01:45:12.151]  But who controls that?
[01:45:12.171 --> 01:45:12.711]  The government.
[01:45:12.771 --> 01:45:25.417]  Because time and again we get cases where the most abusive, backward, degenerate parents get given these children which are taken away from strong, supportive families because the children are identified as having
[01:45:25.917 --> 01:45:27.057]  Mental disorders.
[01:45:29.338 --> 01:45:30.218]  This is how it works.
[01:45:30.238 --> 01:45:32.798]  Your 12-year-old gets in some trouble because that's what happens when you're 12.
[01:45:33.819 --> 01:45:36.399]  You didn't discipline because you were told by Dr. Spock not to.
[01:45:37.539 --> 01:45:41.420]  Then the government grabs your child or makes you put them on one drug.
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:42.100]  They flip out.
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:43.441]  They put you on four drugs.
[01:45:43.921 --> 01:45:47.782]  Then if you don't have a heart attack or have a psychotic break, then they try to commit suicide.
[01:45:47.802 --> 01:45:49.202]  They put you in a mental institution.
[01:45:49.222 --> 01:45:51.382]  Then they go ahead and just take the child away from you.
[01:45:52.342 --> 01:45:54.763]  And that's the story hundreds and hundreds of times that we've seen.
[01:45:56.483 --> 01:46:06.348]  And so they're taking what is kind of a natural thing which happens in the teenage years or younger, which is this kind of rebellious... It's designed to get you out of the hut to go start your own hut.
[01:46:07.689 --> 01:46:11.731]  Yeah, but, you know, every teenager at one point kind of rebels against their parents.
[01:46:11.791 --> 01:46:12.631]  It's a natural thing.
[01:46:12.671 --> 01:46:13.551]  We get over it.
[01:46:13.732 --> 01:46:18.794]  But the government takes it as a sign of mental disorder and then removes the children from the family.
[01:46:20.955 --> 01:46:22.536]  Or there's dirty dishes at the house.
[01:46:23.391 --> 01:46:25.012]  Hi, I'm here with the new Head Start program.
[01:46:25.072 --> 01:46:26.173]  I'm your nice little old lady.
[01:46:26.233 --> 01:46:28.054]  I'm here to advise you and observe your home.
[01:46:28.074 --> 01:46:28.555]  May I come in?
[01:46:28.575 --> 01:46:29.976]  Oh, certainly, come in.
[01:46:29.996 --> 01:46:31.937]  Oh, a dirty dish.
[01:46:32.797 --> 01:46:34.619]  Next day, cops hit, children are taken.
[01:46:35.259 --> 01:46:36.220]  Folks, this is how it works.
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:38.401]  Let's take calls here.
[01:46:38.441 --> 01:46:40.022]  Let's talk to David in Oklahoma.
[01:46:40.042 --> 01:46:40.843]  David, you're on the air.
[01:46:40.863 --> 01:46:42.064]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:42.244 --> 01:46:48.828]  I had a suggestion of an angle to hit this sports narrator thing on that I haven't heard you say anything on.
[01:46:48.868 --> 01:46:51.330]  Maybe it's so obvious it kind of flew under the radar.
[01:46:52.099 --> 01:46:58.243]  But, uh, for the past three years plus, we've been told that we need to be very paranoid, very, very afraid.
[01:46:58.723 --> 01:47:04.306]  And we live in a great, you know, a brave new world now where we're constantly under attack.
[01:47:04.607 --> 01:47:07.869]  And now they want to open the border right straight to the White House.
[01:47:08.489 --> 01:47:10.670]  It seems like... And you heard the earlier caller.
[01:47:10.690 --> 01:47:11.891]  I did confirm that report.
[01:47:12.371 --> 01:47:19.255]  In New York, they're gonna hire, uh, foreigners who aren't even citizens with green cards to be our police.
[01:47:21.217 --> 01:47:21.737]  That's great.
[01:47:22.543 --> 01:47:22.803]  Yeah.
[01:47:23.383 --> 01:47:26.184]  Well, that's all part of the plan.
[01:47:27.364 --> 01:47:30.825]  A caller said, well, would you be against Paul Watson being able to run for president?
[01:47:30.965 --> 01:47:31.866]  We just want good people.
[01:47:32.166 --> 01:47:35.207]  Yes, I'd be against Paul Watson, because it isn't going to be Paul Watson.
[01:47:36.307 --> 01:47:40.208]  It's designed for people like Arnold, Alos, Schwarzenegger.
[01:47:40.468 --> 01:47:42.869]  I don't think Paul wants you to be the king of England either.
[01:47:44.417 --> 01:47:47.019]  It's pretty, it's a stupid concept.
[01:47:47.059 --> 01:47:55.505]  This is training us to have no nationalism unless it's a misdirected nationalism to go bomb some, you know, poor, pathetic third world people in the desert.
[01:47:55.765 --> 01:47:56.805]  Paul Watson comments.
[01:47:57.646 --> 01:48:05.832]  Well yeah, it's interesting how they, because before 9-11 and before the Oklahoma City bombing there was a genuine
[01:48:07.143 --> 01:48:10.645]  Nationalist feeling amongst the Patriot community.
[01:48:11.306 --> 01:48:21.591]  They took that after 9-11 and warped it to support an agenda which is nothing to do with a kind of sovereign or conservative agenda.
[01:48:22.231 --> 01:48:28.173]  But they turned it into nationalism, and it's nationalism defined by waving plastic flags made in China.
[01:48:28.613 --> 01:48:32.775]  So they knew that current was there in the American subcontinent.
[01:48:32.795 --> 01:48:33.595]  So they misdirected it.
[01:48:33.975 --> 01:48:34.895]  Misdirected it.
[01:48:34.955 --> 01:48:36.056]  They do that with everything.
[01:48:36.416 --> 01:48:39.737]  But I mean, with Bush, the first two things he did after being re-elected was
[01:48:40.377 --> 01:48:41.898]  Alright, thanks for the call David.
[01:49:02.324 --> 01:49:06.627]  We're going to have a break, and I'm going to try to accelerate through Eric, Larry, Regina, David, and others.
[01:49:06.707 --> 01:49:10.130]  And Paul, I want to keep you a little bit into the next hour with Mr. Lindsey.
[01:49:12.052 --> 01:49:18.196]  When he joins us to talk about, well, we're going to have people on who believe that it's peacoil running out of oil.
[01:49:18.216 --> 01:49:23.360]  We're also going to have folks on who think that's a fraud and an industry scam.
[01:49:24.561 --> 01:49:30.466]  That's the direction I'm leaning, but still, they're artificially reducing the amount of it, so it's the same effect.
[01:49:31.407 --> 01:49:35.189]  Uh, but we're gonna be having people on from both sides of this, so we'll have the side on.
[01:49:36.609 --> 01:49:41.651]  Lindsey Williams doesn't believe this coming up the next hour as well, but straight to your calls when we get back!
[01:49:42.691 --> 01:49:44.292]  But again, we're evil liberals here.
[01:49:44.672 --> 01:49:49.014]  We're pro-Second Amendment, anti-abortion, pro-border, pro-national sovereignty.
[01:49:49.274 --> 01:49:50.554]  We're against Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:49:51.315 --> 01:49:52.235]  So we're evil liberals.
[01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:57.858]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.

[01:52:59.770 --> 01:53:07.172]  George Herbert Walker Bush, yesterday when Lord Schwarzenegger was here in Texas, pulled a crowd of 2,500 people at the Presidential Library.
[01:53:08.733 --> 01:53:10.133]  Don't bet against Schwarzenegger.
[01:53:10.173 --> 01:53:10.974]  It's no joke.
[01:53:11.814 --> 01:53:14.535]  You're looking at the man that will probably become your president.
[01:53:17.116 --> 01:53:20.157]  And the crowd was not pleased, but it doesn't matter.
[01:53:20.697 --> 01:53:22.738]  It doesn't matter if you're not pleased.
[01:53:22.778 --> 01:53:24.078]  We're going to tell you you're pleased.
[01:53:25.779 --> 01:53:30.281]  I want to skip Larry, only because Regina didn't get on air yesterday.
[01:53:30.301 --> 01:53:37.445]  Then we'll go to Larry and David and then Mike, but I'm going to skip over Larry to Regina because she never got on the air yesterday, one of the callers we didn't get to.
[01:53:38.205 --> 01:53:39.766]  Regina, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:53:39.786 --> 01:53:45.409]  Hi Alex, thank you for the opportunity and hi to Paul Watson, that's an encouragement.
[01:53:47.126 --> 01:53:53.111]  I just wanted to say that I didn't know if maybe you saw this New World Trade Rules may cost 30 million jobs.
[01:53:53.312 --> 01:53:55.353]  I just think this is real interesting.
[01:53:56.034 --> 01:54:00.338]  I agree with you that it really doesn't matter what we believe.
[01:54:00.758 --> 01:54:13.169]  And I keep thinking back to, you know, this man that bothers you in Texas, and I don't know his name, but he goes to the pro-life clinics, the pro-abortion clinics, and then tells you you basically are
[01:54:14.028 --> 01:54:20.090]  Bad news, because you don't support Bush, and I'd like to hold him accountable for this Gonzales character.
[01:54:20.610 --> 01:54:25.191]  You did such a good account on your website, and I hope everybody got on there and got a copy of that.
[01:54:25.611 --> 01:54:28.332]  Because, you know, you know who I'm referring to, Alex?
[01:54:29.032 --> 01:54:29.512]  Oh, yes.
[01:54:29.892 --> 01:54:43.716]  Okay, and the reason I'm bringing this up is because the outcome is that now we have him at the federal level, while these so-called, whatever they are,
[01:54:44.224 --> 01:54:55.089]  Supposedly, handlers of our think and thought decided that Gonzales was okay in Texas and 13-year-olds was okay to not have parental consent.
[01:54:55.590 --> 01:55:02.693]  I think the gold mine is China and I'd like Paul Watson to maybe donate on this because I did send you a copy of this article.
[01:55:02.733 --> 01:55:04.114]  You could study it more on your own.
[01:55:04.899 --> 01:55:05.899]  We'll go over this.
[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:11.542]  They've told us, Congressional Budget Office, the layoffs are going to get seven times greater in high-tech alone.
[01:55:11.782 --> 01:55:16.303]  And Bush said earlier this year, he said, our main export is jobs.
[01:55:16.463 --> 01:55:18.044]  This is good!
[01:55:18.064 --> 01:55:19.825]  This is good!
[01:55:19.845 --> 01:55:28.728]  Do you remember after the election, or after 9-1-1, Bush made the comment that we need people in other countries to have
[01:55:29.429 --> 01:55:31.191]  A job so they don't become terrorists?
[01:55:31.211 --> 01:55:32.572]  Do you remember him saying that?
[01:55:32.632 --> 01:55:34.854]  Yes, it's our job to lose our jobs.
[01:55:34.894 --> 01:55:35.415]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:35.475 --> 01:55:38.157]  Okay, go ahead and finish up, Regina.
[01:55:38.337 --> 01:55:43.522]  This changes to all the jobs that went to the countries that needed a job are now going to China.
[01:55:44.423 --> 01:55:46.125]  New world trade rules.
[01:55:46.545 --> 01:55:47.686]  And it's time to resurrect.
[01:55:47.706 --> 01:55:48.347]  Yes, I understand.
[01:55:48.427 --> 01:55:50.408]  It is designed to get rid of our jobs.
[01:55:50.448 --> 01:55:50.949]  Thank you for the call.
[01:55:51.469 --> 01:55:52.751]  I mean, it is designed to.
[01:55:52.811 --> 01:55:53.972]  And she talks about Gonzales.
[01:55:54.412 --> 01:55:55.133]  Pro-abortion.
[01:55:56.292 --> 01:56:06.620]  No parental consent, pro-gun control, pro-open borders, member of La Raza, everything else you can imagine, and the neocons are defending him just like they defend Arnold?
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:07.661]  They don't care.
[01:56:07.961 --> 01:56:14.105]  The more liberal, by liberal I mean the more big government you are, the more pro-death you are, the more they love you.
[01:56:14.145 --> 01:56:14.726]  Paul Watson?
[01:56:15.788 --> 01:56:28.571]  Well, yeah, as I said before, the first two things that Bush did was appoint people to his administration who were both pro-open border and pro-abortion, which proves that it's not a conservative administration.
[01:56:28.691 --> 01:56:31.732]  Defending and campaigning for Spectre against a real conservative!
[01:56:32.832 --> 01:56:44.155]  Yeah, while they throw out the rhetoric, you know, in the debates of being against stem cell research using baby stem cells... Then Bush brags that he gave them record funding!
[01:56:45.242 --> 01:56:47.323]  Yeah, I mean, partial birth abortion.
[01:56:47.604 --> 01:56:55.149]  He supposedly passed the bill, and the bill was overturned by every judge in every major metropolitan city.
[01:56:55.529 --> 01:56:59.952]  So it has no effect whatsoever with the job situation.
[01:56:59.972 --> 01:57:01.533]  I mean, what is it now with Walmart?
[01:57:01.913 --> 01:57:08.358]  If you took Walmart as a country, they're China's eighth biggest trading partner as a country.
[01:57:08.998 --> 01:57:11.660]  That shows you the direction in which America is heading.
[01:57:13.985 --> 01:57:16.006]  They've got to get us dependent on government.
[01:57:16.026 --> 01:57:18.807]  They've got to take our jobs so we're under their control.
[01:57:19.148 --> 01:57:26.851]  They want to get us in the psychiatric system, the welfare system, the criminal justice system, or draft you through national service.
[01:57:26.951 --> 01:57:27.692]  Four ways.
[01:57:28.492 --> 01:57:29.813]  You will be a ward of the state.
[01:57:30.373 --> 01:57:31.293]  It's the new economy.
[01:57:31.313 --> 01:57:33.414]  They're going to take the service economy away from you too.
[01:57:33.895 --> 01:57:38.317]  And many of you will serve them and worship them just to have a job.
[01:57:39.177 --> 01:57:40.318]  We'll be back in the third hour.
[01:57:40.378 --> 01:57:40.958]  Please stay with us.
[01:57:43.769 --> 01:57:44.029]  Hello!
[01:57:49.792 --> 01:57:50.452]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.092 --> 01:57:52.193]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.873 --> 01:57:54.034]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.614 --> 01:57:55.474]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.195 --> 01:57:57.135]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.155 --> 01:58:01.417]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.937 --> 01:58:06.099]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:12.462]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, Paul Watson will be riding his shotgun with us for just a few more minutes.
[01:58:13.175 --> 01:58:17.937]  Got Lindsey Williams, the energy non-crisis, coming on from the other side.
[01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:22.299]  View of there not being a peak oil problem.
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:24.720]  But I lean towards this view.
[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:25.461]  I've been studying it.
[01:58:25.481 --> 01:58:28.802]  We're going to have some people who believe in peak oil on in the near future.
[01:58:29.622 --> 01:58:31.923]  Paul Watson, though, riding shotgun with us.
[01:58:32.304 --> 01:58:34.244]  A lot of other news as well coming up.
[01:58:35.345 --> 01:58:39.047]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the patient callers.
[01:58:40.087 --> 01:58:41.628]  Let us now talk to
[01:58:43.004 --> 01:58:46.868]  I guess Larry in Texas, or is it David?
[01:58:48.450 --> 01:58:50.653]  Larry in Texas, you're up next, go ahead.
[01:58:51.814 --> 01:58:53.496]  Hey Alex, I support your show.
[01:58:53.756 --> 01:58:54.817]  You there?
[01:58:55.217 --> 01:58:55.518]  Yes sir.
[01:58:56.239 --> 01:59:02.185]  Yeah, I've got several of your videos, and I'm a subscriber to your Prison Planet TV.
[01:59:02.365 --> 01:59:02.906]  Well thank you!
[01:59:03.522 --> 01:59:09.387]  Um, what I wanted to make a comment on is a whole Arnold thing is, um, the foundation's already been set.
[01:59:09.807 --> 01:59:25.599]  Um, most of all the high-tech companies and corporations in America, including the news media and that, are basically, it's all, the government is controlled by corporations, for corporations, and most of all these corporations are head up by foreign nationals.
[01:59:26.259 --> 01:59:32.604]  I mean, the CEOs are either Zionist Jews, or they're either from India, or, you know, other immigrants, so,
[01:59:33.434 --> 01:59:42.078]  It makes no problem at all to have Arnold, who is foreign-born, to be president because, you know, our government is controlled by corporations.
[01:59:42.318 --> 01:59:43.218]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:59:43.238 --> 01:59:46.419]  I mean, you've got German CEOs, American CEOs, whatever.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.020]  This is about getting rid of national sovereignty.
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:56.403]  And again, for those that missed it, Houston Chronicle, up on InfoWars.com, going up on PrisonPlanet.com, and ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:59:58.004 --> 02:00:04.846]  Came right out, George Bush yesterday, Herbert Walker gave him an award at the Presidential Library and said, don't bet against him.
[02:00:04.866 --> 02:00:08.307]  You know, he's the man, stop doubting it, he said.
[02:00:08.347 --> 02:00:10.667]  This is going to be, probably going to be your president.
[02:00:12.168 --> 02:00:20.550]  Well, another comment I'd like to make is, you seem to stress a lot that, well, you point out about all the Nazis and all that.
[02:00:21.690 --> 02:00:24.471]  Currently, I look at our government, it's not controlled by Nazis.
[02:00:24.531 --> 02:00:27.152]  I mean, it's controlled by a Zionist occupied
[02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:28.791]  government.
[02:00:28.831 --> 02:00:33.054]  I mean, you look at all of Bush's cabinet members, they all have Jewish last names.
[02:00:33.594 --> 02:00:35.735]  Now, I'm not against Jews, but I am against... Really?
[02:00:36.396 --> 02:00:38.798]  Ashcroft or Connolly Sarai are Jewish?
[02:00:39.198 --> 02:00:40.879]  Well... Gonzales?
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:42.880]  Well, most of them are.
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:45.322]  The ones that have just left... You've got George Tenet.
[02:00:45.602 --> 02:00:50.205]  He was confirmed that he does have a... It was a Jewish last name that he had.
[02:00:50.246 --> 02:00:51.546]  He just changed it to Tenet.
[02:00:51.606 --> 02:00:53.688]  It was actually Cohen, which was the last name.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:56.800]  My point is this.
[02:00:57.020 --> 02:01:03.202]  I think when we say it's Jews or it's Catholics or it's whatever, that distracts from the general public.
[02:01:03.542 --> 02:01:05.142]  Then you use those labels.
[02:01:06.202 --> 02:01:08.342]  Really, Skull and Bones is Nazi.
[02:01:08.723 --> 02:01:10.603]  Bohemian Grove is Germanic.
[02:01:11.743 --> 02:01:12.903]  I've been to the Grove.
[02:01:13.363 --> 02:01:15.484]  It's all about being Germanic.
[02:01:15.744 --> 02:01:22.345]  There is a weird team-up between some of these Zionist leaders, who by the way, some of them helped fund Hitler,
[02:01:23.773 --> 02:01:25.874]  And the Nazis.
[02:01:25.894 --> 02:01:28.116]  But I don't believe it's a Jewish or a German thing.
[02:01:28.156 --> 02:01:30.518]  I believe it's a Luciferian thing.
[02:01:30.538 --> 02:01:31.099]  Paul Watson?
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:42.869]  The so-called Zionist lobby in America has exactly the same goals as the so-called fundamentalist Christian lobby.
[02:01:43.633 --> 02:01:49.435]  And the point to make about it, too, is that they're neither representative of Jewish people or Christians.
[02:01:49.895 --> 02:01:53.397]  It's just a tag to push an agenda which they both agree on.
[02:01:53.417 --> 02:01:58.918]  Yeah, so they can dance around and say, we're the Jews, you know, Jewish people should follow us, or we're Christians.
[02:01:58.958 --> 02:02:02.620]  If you're a Christian, you believe George Bush is a prophet of God.
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:05.801]  I mean, you know, I'm a Christian.
[02:02:06.081 --> 02:02:09.362]  Just because Bush claims he's a Christian, you know, doesn't mean all Christians are bad.
[02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:11.203]  Well, the problem I've got is
[02:02:12.153 --> 02:02:23.322]  A lot of the Christianity of today, you might as well call it Turkey-anity, because it's based on Judeo-Christian values, which, if you study Judaism, it is a cult.
[02:02:23.482 --> 02:02:24.683]  It is not a religion.
[02:02:25.224 --> 02:02:27.085]  It's based on the Babylonian Talmud.
[02:02:27.466 --> 02:02:34.091]  I mean, the Jews follow that almost precisely to how they, you know, live their lives.
[02:02:34.712 --> 02:02:36.313]  Do not follow the, you know,
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:38.064]  They don't follow the Bible.
[02:02:38.224 --> 02:02:39.609]  They don't follow the Old Testament.
[02:02:39.930 --> 02:02:40.673]  Alright, hey listen!
[02:02:40.713 --> 02:02:41.696]  Well, there's different sects.
[02:02:42.238 --> 02:02:43.061]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:43.121 --> 02:02:43.803]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:02:47.742 --> 02:02:53.207]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.648 --> 02:02:57.872]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:02:58.112 --> 02:03:05.159]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.539 --> 02:03:11.645]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:11.785 --> 02:03:12.986]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.326 --> 02:03:16.269]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:16.429 --> 02:03:18.451]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:18.752 --> 02:03:26.019]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:26.299 --> 02:03:29.683]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:07.323]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.

[02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:52.078]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:04:52.378 --> 02:04:53.760]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:56.162]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:04:56.302 --> 02:04:58.384]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:04:58.665 --> 02:05:03.630]  If you want to wake up your friends and families with the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:07.974]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:05:08.214 --> 02:05:09.995]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:05:10.075 --> 02:05:20.720]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:22.761]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:05:40.011 --> 02:05:40.452]  Big Brother.
[02:05:40.472 --> 02:05:41.733]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:41.813 --> 02:05:42.513]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.677 --> 02:05:55.497]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.258 --> 02:05:57.198]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.218 --> 02:06:01.699]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.999 --> 02:06:06.121]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.221 --> 02:06:23.546]  You know, my friends, I don't believe that any particular group of humans, supposed subrace, or subspecies, whether it's Anglo-Saxons that are a Germanic mix, or, uh,
[02:06:25.254 --> 02:06:27.235]  Israelites, Arabs, whatever.
[02:06:27.275 --> 02:06:29.516]  I don't believe any one group is inherently evil.
[02:06:30.377 --> 02:06:31.918]  Now, I do fight organized crime.
[02:06:32.038 --> 02:06:33.638]  And there is Jewish organized crime.
[02:06:34.399 --> 02:06:38.441]  And, uh, when you criticize it, sometimes they'll try to use the anti-Semitic label, but that doesn't work.
[02:06:38.761 --> 02:06:40.622]  There's German organized crime rings.
[02:06:41.082 --> 02:06:42.883]  There's Italian organized crime rings.
[02:06:43.423 --> 02:06:45.304]  And I do talk about the organized crime rings.
[02:06:46.225 --> 02:06:47.626]  But I've really studied the New World Order.
[02:06:47.666 --> 02:06:50.127]  We're fighting evil people that team up together.
[02:06:51.752 --> 02:06:55.414]  And I really, from my study, don't believe it's any one group.
[02:06:55.494 --> 02:07:01.357]  We've got evil people in control of the Catholics, in control of the Protestants, in control of the Jews, in control of the Arabs.
[02:07:01.798 --> 02:07:02.838]  That's what the Bible says.
[02:07:03.278 --> 02:07:07.080]  Wicked people get put into positions of power by the God of this world.
[02:07:08.461 --> 02:07:16.045]  And we've got Lindsey Williams in the wings here, but David in Colorado, who says he's Jewish, wanted to respond
[02:07:17.006 --> 02:07:20.268]  Maybe we should have a debate about this sometime.
[02:07:20.288 --> 02:07:21.808]  People know where I stand on this.
[02:07:21.849 --> 02:07:23.509]  I get called a Mossad agent.
[02:07:37.359 --> 02:07:39.620]  For not thinking the Jews are the devil's seed.
[02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:44.561]  And then I'll also get white supremacist groups calling up and threatening me.
[02:07:45.081 --> 02:07:48.862]  And then I'll also have the ADL attack me because I'm pro-gun and anti-UN.
[02:07:49.262 --> 02:07:56.004]  So you've got that little organized crime unit out there being protected by the ADL.
[02:07:56.984 --> 02:07:58.785]  And it's horrible what they do.
[02:07:59.605 --> 02:08:01.386]  So I get it from both sides, man.
[02:08:01.406 --> 02:08:04.086]  It's a great thing, let me tell you, just because I fight organized crime.
[02:08:04.567 --> 02:08:05.767]  David, go ahead and make your points.
[02:08:06.417 --> 02:08:07.838]  Yes, thank you Alex.
[02:08:07.918 --> 02:08:08.619]  I love your show.
[02:08:08.639 --> 02:08:09.980]  I've been listening for three years.
[02:08:11.261 --> 02:08:15.344]  Yes, I'm a Jew and I believe in God and Jesus Christ.
[02:08:16.905 --> 02:08:23.770]  And I want to remind all the callers out there who call in about the Jews that it's a Jewish conspiracy.
[02:08:24.811 --> 02:08:26.132]  And I agree with your point.
[02:08:26.773 --> 02:08:33.378]  And I want to remind everybody out there that the Holy Scriptures was written Old and New Testament.
[02:08:34.181 --> 02:08:34.801]  By Jews.
[02:08:35.242 --> 02:08:39.604]  Jewish prophets of God and that Jesus Christ was a Jew.
[02:08:39.744 --> 02:08:43.307]  Well, and all those prophets were criticizing the leadership of Israel.
[02:08:44.067 --> 02:08:44.628]  That's right.
[02:08:45.248 --> 02:08:46.289]  Perpetually.
[02:08:46.349 --> 02:08:51.392]  So then we get this warped view of, don't criticize Israel, or you're against God.
[02:08:51.492 --> 02:08:54.534]  No, we are to criticize any corrupt leadership.
[02:08:55.214 --> 02:08:55.714]  That's right.
[02:08:55.794 --> 02:08:58.096]  And it's a Luciferian conspiracy.
[02:08:58.156 --> 02:08:59.357]  There are Jews involved.
[02:08:59.417 --> 02:09:01.418]  There are people of every race involved.
[02:09:03.353 --> 02:09:17.704]  Look, look, look, look, I've had people, uh, I've had people, my last name is Jones, and that's Welsh, folks, and they call up and go, we know Jones means Jonas, you're a Jew.
[02:09:18.645 --> 02:09:21.467]  And so I go on the air and go, well actually I've got some Native American in me, and
[02:09:22.656 --> 02:09:27.740]  You know, my wife's grandmother was Jewish, or part Jewish, from Poland.
[02:09:28.261 --> 02:09:32.123]  So, my gosh, man, I am just, you know, and then they, oh, it's a big secret.
[02:09:32.284 --> 02:09:33.424]  We secretly learned it.
[02:09:33.464 --> 02:09:34.505]  No, you learned it here.
[02:09:35.306 --> 02:09:36.647]  And I'm sick of it.
[02:09:36.987 --> 02:09:41.931]  I mean, you know, I'm sick of hearing, I'm sick of hearing anybody who's got any melanin in their skin is a devil.
[02:09:42.231 --> 02:09:43.592]  You know, it's the devil's tribe.
[02:09:43.692 --> 02:09:45.413]  Oh, he's got Native American in him.
[02:09:45.453 --> 02:09:46.254]  He's a devil.
[02:09:46.734 --> 02:09:51.558]  But, look, folks, and all these groups use this race stuff to control their people.
[02:09:52.290 --> 02:09:55.752]  You know, I mean, the Jewish organizations do it and feed off their own people.
[02:09:56.653 --> 02:09:57.854]  It's just amazing.
[02:09:58.454 --> 02:09:59.895]  Listen, I appreciate your call, my friend.
[02:10:00.756 --> 02:10:01.456]  Take care, David.
[02:10:01.616 --> 02:10:03.838]  I apologize for having Lindsey Williams hold there.
[02:10:04.198 --> 02:10:10.022]  Paul Watson, any final comments on this topic, this endless topic of the Jews that just got brought back up?
[02:10:10.831 --> 02:10:15.017]  Well, yeah, I mean, you know, was Moses part of the Jewish conspiracy?
[02:10:15.057 --> 02:10:15.277]  No.
[02:10:15.337 --> 02:10:17.800]  I mean, the Jews I know don't follow the Talmud.
[02:10:18.201 --> 02:10:23.588]  We were taught that the Nazis and the Communists were opposite sides of the political spectrum.
[02:10:23.628 --> 02:10:25.230]  They both persecuted Jews.
[02:10:25.831 --> 02:10:29.654]  So, then it was Jews, now it's Muslims, in the future it's going to be everyone.
[02:10:29.674 --> 02:10:30.955]  It's command and control.
[02:10:31.035 --> 02:10:39.040]  It's not specific to race, it's specific to an idea of creating a new world order which enslaves everybody, no matter their color or creed.
[02:10:39.361 --> 02:10:39.821]  Absolutely.
[02:10:39.861 --> 02:10:41.382]  Let's bring Lindsey Williams in.
[02:10:41.402 --> 02:10:42.323]  Haven't had him on in years.
[02:10:42.363 --> 02:10:43.043]  Honored to have him.
[02:10:43.083 --> 02:10:45.385]  The book, The Energy Non-Crisis.
[02:10:46.085 --> 02:10:49.788]  Lindsey Williams, who has been an ordained Baptist minister for 28 years.
[02:10:50.108 --> 02:10:51.349]  Went to Alaska in 71 as a missionary.
[02:10:53.750 --> 02:11:04.857]  And he worked for a large oil pipeline, or ministered there, and was brought into top-level board meetings as their chaplain, as their pastor, and heard the U.S.
[02:11:04.897 --> 02:11:08.399]  government tell him, don't tell people about all the oil, and that's why he joins us.
[02:11:08.439 --> 02:11:11.001]  But as a minister, you want to comment on the whole Jew thing?
[02:11:12.482 --> 02:11:13.722]  Not necessarily, Alex.
[02:11:14.063 --> 02:11:15.984]  I don't get involved in that subject at all.
[02:11:16.364 --> 02:11:16.764]  Yeah, I know.
[02:11:16.964 --> 02:11:20.907]  I mean, I get... People constantly bring it up, and, you know, so we have to discuss it.
[02:11:21.696 --> 02:11:23.137]  That's not my expertise.
[02:11:23.177 --> 02:11:24.397]  I've never written a book on it.
[02:11:24.997 --> 02:11:32.601]  And right now, what you and I have to talk about today on this program impacts and concerns the life of every human being.
[02:11:32.681 --> 02:11:34.601]  Regardless of what group you're with, yeah.
[02:11:35.502 --> 02:11:35.682]  Oil.
[02:11:35.902 --> 02:11:40.724]  I mean, for goodness sakes, let's get down to where the potency is and what's going on today.
[02:11:41.004 --> 02:11:45.766]  The issue right now is what are you paying for the price of a gallon of gasoline at that gas pump?
[02:11:45.806 --> 02:11:48.287]  What did you pay for fuel oil to heat your home this morning?
[02:11:48.727 --> 02:11:50.548]  What did the price of oil go up to today?
[02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:55.872]  We have as much crude oil on the North Slope of Alaska as there is in Saudi Arabia.
[02:11:56.352 --> 02:12:02.175]  We have one pool of oil alone on the North Slope of Alaska, which is out in Gull Island.
[02:12:02.775 --> 02:12:05.476]  It's documented in my book, The Energy Non-Crisis.
[02:12:05.556 --> 02:12:10.018]  It's the only book on the face of the Earth that gives the facts of what's there.
[02:12:10.418 --> 02:12:14.260]  It's probably the largest single pool of oil on the face of the Earth.
[02:12:14.665 --> 02:12:22.710]  Not one drop of that oil has ever been allowed to come to the American people by the design plan of the people who are controlling us.
[02:12:23.091 --> 02:12:32.457]  And George Bush has the legislative, the executive, and the judicial, and all the agencies, and the governorships, and he's not going to let us have that oil.
[02:12:33.438 --> 02:12:38.561]  Well, they won't open up the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, but we don't need to open up the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.
[02:12:38.601 --> 02:12:41.203]  We have everything we need right out there in the Arctic Ocean.
[02:12:41.844 --> 02:12:42.965]  There's no need in the world.
[02:12:42.985 --> 02:12:46.466]  I mean, we can supply everything that the American people need.
[02:12:46.526 --> 02:12:50.488]  Now, you are paying $2 plus per gallon at the gas pump.
[02:12:50.508 --> 02:12:53.409]  California's paying well over $2 a gallon.
[02:12:54.469 --> 02:13:02.633]  The Energy Non-Crisis and To Seduce a Nation, my two books, tell how the people who control the world are controlling you.
[02:13:02.893 --> 02:13:04.593]  They're controlling you at the gas pump.
[02:13:05.314 --> 02:13:06.154]  Yes, that's right.
[02:13:06.613 --> 02:13:08.114]  It is a form of taxation.
[02:13:08.434 --> 02:13:09.195]  Listen carefully.
[02:13:09.255 --> 02:13:10.616]  This one you want to jot down.
[02:13:10.956 --> 02:13:24.126]  Anytime the price of a gallon of gasoline is $2 a gallon at the gas pump, the people who control the world are making over $60 billion per year, and that is not OPEC.
[02:13:24.487 --> 02:13:25.447]  It's not the Arabs.
[02:13:25.788 --> 02:13:29.030]  Some people think that OPEC controls the price of a gallon of gasoline.
[02:13:29.070 --> 02:13:29.911]  That's not true at all.
[02:13:30.512 --> 02:13:40.296]  The price of a gallon of gasoline is controlled by the people who sit behind the computers in New York and London and tell OPEC every day what they're going to give them for the price of that barrel of oil.
[02:13:40.496 --> 02:13:41.057]  That's right.
[02:13:41.657 --> 02:13:44.978]  The Arabs get a very small portion of the money.
[02:13:45.018 --> 02:13:47.559]  They're just conspicuous spenders.
[02:13:50.041 --> 02:13:53.582]  And so the world sees them as controlling all this.
[02:13:55.183 --> 02:13:57.644]  Lindsey, tell folks how you learned about this.
[02:13:58.453 --> 02:14:00.495]  Well, I learned about it by the providence of God.
[02:14:00.535 --> 02:14:02.176]  I never went looking for what I saw.
[02:14:02.717 --> 02:14:12.346]  I was a missionary in the state of Alaska, an aviation missionary, and I was very happy with what I was doing, but I heard in 1970 that they were going to build the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline.
[02:14:12.946 --> 02:14:24.637]  And the first thing that came to my mind was 25,000 pipeliners and roughest, cussing-dest, pranking-dest folks on the face of the earth, and believe you me, that was the understatement of the year when I got there and found out.
[02:14:25.294 --> 02:14:31.418]  And I went to Alaska Pipeline Service Company and I said, don't you need a chaplain on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline?
[02:14:31.678 --> 02:14:32.419]  They laughed at me.
[02:14:32.559 --> 02:14:35.481]  They said, we never had a chaplain on any pipeline in the world.
[02:14:35.761 --> 02:14:37.242]  I kept going back and back and back.
[02:14:37.302 --> 02:14:39.824]  I guess they got tired of seeing me around the Anchorage office.
[02:14:39.864 --> 02:14:46.048]  They finally said, okay, we'll give you all seven camps from Prudhoe Bay, where the big oil field is, down to Galbraith Lake.
[02:14:46.628 --> 02:14:50.551]  You rotate amongst them every day, seven days a week, hold a worship service, do what you can.
[02:14:50.987 --> 02:14:52.768]  About six months later, Mr. R.H.
[02:14:52.948 --> 02:14:59.312]  King, personnel relations man with Aliaska, came to me and he said, Lindsey, you're saving us thousands of dollars of counseling fees.
[02:14:59.752 --> 02:15:02.314]  We've just decided to give you executive status.
[02:15:02.394 --> 02:15:04.275]  And I said, well, what does that mean, Mr. King?
[02:15:04.816 --> 02:15:06.577]  He said, well, go any place you want to.
[02:15:06.637 --> 02:15:08.698]  Stay in executive dorms, see what you'd like.
[02:15:09.378 --> 02:15:18.024]  And he said, I'd like to invite you to sit in on our board meetings in an advisory capacity in order to help the relationship between management and labor.
[02:15:18.164 --> 02:15:18.344]  Alex,
[02:15:18.959 --> 02:15:24.022]  What I saw and heard, literally, over the next three years, changed my life.
[02:15:24.062 --> 02:15:32.887]  If someone had asked me in 1970, do you believe there's a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world, I would have laughed at them and said, who are you, a John Bircher?
[02:15:33.328 --> 02:15:48.597]  If someone had asked me in 1980, when I wrote my book, The Energy Non-Crisis, do you believe there's a group of people on the face of the earth that control the President, the Federal Reserve, our currency, and our Congress, and the nations of the world, I would have said, not only do I believe it,
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:52.503]  I sat and listened to them talk about it for three years time.
[02:15:52.923 --> 02:15:55.005]  I remember one night I went back to my dorm room.
[02:15:55.025 --> 02:16:03.973]  I looked up at the ceiling and I literally cried out to God and I said, Oh God, I can't believe there's such a dastardly group of people on the face of this earth.
[02:16:04.454 --> 02:16:06.416]  Who literally manipulate nations.
[02:16:09.239 --> 02:16:10.220]  I've done that many times.
[02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:20.209]  I mean, it's painful to watch them rob and rule and rape the people and to watch the people so ignorant about it, you know, to have that strong conviction of wanting to right wrong.
[02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:22.451]  Paul Watson, we're about to let you go.
[02:16:22.511 --> 02:16:23.412]  Any final comments?
[02:16:24.433 --> 02:16:28.037]  Well, yeah, just to throw a paradox in there, which relates to oil.
[02:16:29.156 --> 02:16:38.607]  In my country, in Britain, we have hosepipe bans, which means you can only use a certain amount of water that is allocated to you by the government.
[02:16:39.088 --> 02:16:44.154]  But at the same time, they're telling us, the left-wing environmental organisations,
[02:16:44.634 --> 02:16:51.977]  That the polar ice caps are melting and that the country is going to be submerged by water within, you know, a hundred years.
[02:16:52.057 --> 02:16:55.078]  So surely there would be a plentiful supply of water.
[02:16:55.258 --> 02:16:56.679]  Oh, your country's got water?
[02:16:56.739 --> 02:16:58.979]  I mean, the UN has said there's no water now.
[02:16:59.239 --> 02:17:00.420]  They're starting that scam!
[02:17:01.818 --> 02:17:12.384]  Yeah, and so you can apply that to oil with the left-wing mantra of, you know, no blood for oil, but then the same people are involved in these environmental groups that prevent the oil being taken out of Alaska.
[02:17:12.804 --> 02:17:18.648]  So within that controlled prism, they're self-regulating their own arguments, and it's a complete paradox.
[02:17:18.908 --> 02:17:20.969]  All right, Paul Watson, I appreciate you joining us.
[02:17:20.989 --> 02:17:21.750]  You're going to post that
[02:17:22.978 --> 02:17:26.021]  George Bush, Houston Chronicle article about Lord Schwarzenegger?
[02:17:26.541 --> 02:17:27.422]  I'll be right on it now.
[02:17:27.862 --> 02:17:28.323]  All right.
[02:17:28.523 --> 02:17:31.665]  We'll be right back with Lindsey Williams to continue and take your calls.
[02:17:32.306 --> 02:17:33.567]  Energy non-crisis.
[02:17:34.728 --> 02:17:35.869]  It's a fact, folks.
[02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:39.052]  But they're creating the perception there's no oil.
[02:17:40.553 --> 02:17:41.254]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:41.274 --> 02:17:41.674]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.538 --> 02:17:48.039]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[02:17:48.420 --> 02:17:51.361]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[02:17:51.501 --> 02:17:55.143]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[02:17:55.344 --> 02:17:57.785]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[02:17:57.945 --> 02:18:01.187]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[02:18:01.367 --> 02:18:08.731]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.

[02:18:32.879 --> 02:18:37.984]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[02:18:38.044 --> 02:18:40.546]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[02:18:46.576 --> 02:18:47.637]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:18:47.958 --> 02:18:50.741]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:51.001 --> 02:18:55.166]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:55.606 --> 02:18:56.427]  So what do you do?
[02:18:56.748 --> 02:19:01.313]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:01.793 --> 02:19:03.914]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:19:45.342 --> 02:19:50.908]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:19:51.149 --> 02:19:52.190]  You use deodorant, right?
[02:19:52.410 --> 02:19:53.291]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:56.054]  You obviously wear it to cover up the embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:19:56.294 --> 02:20:01.160]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?

[02:20:10.004 --> 02:20:12.985]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[02:20:13.145 --> 02:20:18.908]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.

[02:20:48.836 --> 02:20:54.264]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:20:54.725 --> 02:20:55.806]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[02:20:55.847 --> 02:20:59.893]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:21:00.533 --> 02:21:13.825]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:21:14.345 --> 02:21:19.650]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:21:19.950 --> 02:21:25.855]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:21:26.579 --> 02:21:28.400]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:29.441 --> 02:21:32.602]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:21:33.043 --> 02:21:34.223]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:36.024 --> 02:21:40.266]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:21:40.286 --> 02:21:42.187]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:51.312]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:51.973 --> 02:21:54.254]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:56.326 --> 02:22:00.868]  Now look, folks, I'm not saying that some oil fields in the world have been depleted.
[02:22:02.148 --> 02:22:04.869]  But they're finding giant amounts of oil all over the world.
[02:22:05.629 --> 02:22:08.170]  Then they go into Iraq and don't ship the oil out.
[02:22:08.190 --> 02:22:09.491]  People go, well, see, it wasn't about oil.
[02:22:09.551 --> 02:22:14.893]  No, it was about getting control of that oil so they wouldn't bring it to market to jack up prices.
[02:22:16.064 --> 02:22:22.966]  So when you hear about Peak Oil, and I'm even a sponsor, wanted me to promote a book they're putting out that thinks Peak Oil is real, and I said, OK, I'll promote it.
[02:22:23.006 --> 02:22:25.747]  I mean, my mind isn't totally made up.
[02:22:26.707 --> 02:22:30.648]  Even with all these new big supplies out there, perhaps those could become depleted.
[02:22:31.668 --> 02:22:33.309]  But we're going to investigate this.
[02:22:33.369 --> 02:22:35.469]  And I know, I've talked to people who worked in Alaska.
[02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:36.910]  I've talked to people in the oil industry.
[02:22:36.930 --> 02:22:37.790]  I've got family that's in it.
[02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:40.711]  They're finding oil all the time, masses of it.
[02:22:41.249 --> 02:22:44.611]  But they're telling you there's no oil, so they can artificially jack up the prices.
[02:22:44.631 --> 02:22:46.512]  So, the oil shortage is real.
[02:22:46.912 --> 02:22:49.394]  Whether it's real or manufactured, they're certainly doing it.
[02:22:49.734 --> 02:22:51.155]  But Lindsey Williams was there.
[02:22:52.075 --> 02:23:00.200]  Lindsey, tell us, when you're in these big board meetings with the oil company, and go over the company and the rest of it, what types of things did you hear and see?
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.561]  Oh, there is no shortage of oil.
[02:23:02.762 --> 02:23:10.386]  That positively is enough to supply the United States of America for years, just from the Prudhoe Bay oil field and north slope of Alaska alone.
[02:23:10.993 --> 02:23:14.214]  The price... This peak oil thing is a total scam.
[02:23:14.334 --> 02:23:18.916]  It's only for the purpose of being able to boost the price of that gallon of gas at the gas pump.
[02:23:19.376 --> 02:23:23.878]  The price of a gallon of gas at the gas pump is a form of taxation.
[02:23:24.699 --> 02:23:32.042]  If only the American people... If the World Bank came in and said, OK, we're going to tax your income next month.
[02:23:32.102 --> 02:23:35.403]  We're going to put... You're going to pay us like you pay internal revenue.
[02:23:36.014 --> 02:23:39.757]  Every single person in America would rise up in arms and say, not on your life.
[02:23:39.938 --> 02:23:41.479]  No, it is international tax.
[02:23:42.260 --> 02:23:54.010]  At the gas pump, they're taxing you every single time you buy a gallon of gas, because the people who control the price of that gallon of gas is none other than the people who control the world.
[02:23:54.690 --> 02:23:57.192]  You say, well, Lindsey Williams, how in the world do you know all of this?
[02:23:57.473 --> 02:24:02.437]  Listen, if someone had said to me, there are people in the world who control the world,
[02:24:04.530 --> 02:24:07.892]  When I was a Baptist preacher back 40 years ago, I would have laughed at them.
[02:24:08.393 --> 02:24:10.294]  Believe me, I know they're for real.
[02:24:10.334 --> 02:24:11.075]  Well, you were there!
[02:24:11.895 --> 02:24:13.356]  Tell folks about these board meetings.
[02:24:13.917 --> 02:24:18.600]  Oh, I sat in the board meetings and heard them talk about the plan they had for the Arabs.
[02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:19.001]  30 years!
[02:24:19.061 --> 02:24:25.526]  They had a 30-year plan for the Arabs, and they have carried it out precisely, exactly as they said they were going to do.
[02:24:25.546 --> 02:24:29.109]  Yeah, and you wrote your book 20-something years ago, and it's very accurate.
[02:24:29.149 --> 02:24:30.550]  So tell us about these meetings.
[02:24:30.570 --> 02:24:32.831]  I mean, you've named names before on this show.
[02:24:32.851 --> 02:24:33.532]  Tell us what happened.
[02:24:34.324 --> 02:24:36.625]  Well, let's take, for instance, Mr. Ken Fromm.
[02:24:36.725 --> 02:24:42.108]  He was the senior executive of Atlantic Richfield, who produced the entire east side of the Pudeau Bay oil field.
[02:24:42.669 --> 02:24:47.691]  Ken Fromm called me up on the phone one day, and he said, Lindsey, are you going to be in any speaking engagements for so long?
[02:24:47.731 --> 02:24:52.514]  And I said, yes, I'm going to be from Washington State to the end of California, about over the next two months.
[02:24:52.854 --> 02:25:01.999]  He said, tell everybody, every place you go, that the price of a barrel of oil is up to a certain price, which was about $20 under what it was right then.
[02:25:02.529 --> 02:25:03.870]  I said, Ken, they'd laugh at me.
[02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:10.114]  I said, the Arab world would crash if this happened.
[02:25:10.534 --> 02:25:13.436]  He said, Lindsey, don't you know who controls that?
[02:25:13.936 --> 02:25:15.277]  He said, OPEC doesn't.
[02:25:15.557 --> 02:25:16.357]  Now, he said, come on.
[02:25:16.698 --> 02:25:17.998]  You were sitting in those meetings.
[02:25:18.319 --> 02:25:20.080]  You know what happened at Gaul Island.
[02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:22.201]  You know how we had to cap those wells.
[02:25:22.481 --> 02:25:24.542]  You know good and well where the preparations were.
[02:25:24.823 --> 02:25:32.087]  He said, I rewrote your book for you after Atlantic Richfield fired me, after you wrote your first book, and then he said they hired me back.
[02:25:32.515 --> 02:25:34.597]  And put me in Houston to consult.
[02:25:35.358 --> 02:25:38.340]  Alex, let me give you just an example of how they do these things.
[02:25:38.420 --> 02:25:41.443]  Because if the average American only... Oh, wait a minute.
[02:25:42.043 --> 02:25:44.806]  I know we've only got about 45 more minutes on this show.
[02:25:45.106 --> 02:25:53.193]  Please, every person in this listening audience, would you allow me to give you all four copies, all four of my books.
[02:25:53.533 --> 02:25:55.115]  Now that's right, they're over 200 pages long.
[02:25:56.843 --> 02:25:58.284]  These are not pamphlets.
[02:25:58.364 --> 02:26:00.386]  These are over 200 page long books.
[02:26:00.866 --> 02:26:03.288]  Full color covers, beautifully done.
[02:26:03.689 --> 02:26:08.352]  They cost quite a bit of money, but there's no sense in me keeping them out here in my warehouse.
[02:26:08.653 --> 02:26:13.536]  Would you please let me give you, every person, that's correct, I said give you as a gift.
[02:26:13.577 --> 02:26:18.941]  When you get my videotapes, I will give you as a gift all four of my books.
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:21.221]  with every single one of the videotapes.
[02:26:21.481 --> 02:26:22.501]  Let me give you an example.
[02:26:22.801 --> 02:26:27.863]  I invited a senator, Senator Hugh Chance, from the state of Colorado to come to Prudhoe Bay and spend a week with me.
[02:26:27.923 --> 02:26:28.264]  He did.
[02:26:29.764 --> 02:26:35.827]  He had been sitting in the Senate of the state of Colorado when the men came from Washington to brief them on the energy crisis.
[02:26:36.327 --> 02:26:41.029]  When he got to Prudhoe Bay, he met with Mr. Ken Fromm, the senior executive of Atlantic Richfield.
[02:26:41.049 --> 02:26:42.409]  He met with Jim Lawler.
[02:26:42.789 --> 02:26:46.071]  He met with all of the Mr. X's of my book, The Energy and I'm Crisis.
[02:26:46.111 --> 02:26:47.311]  He asked them questions.
[02:26:47.351 --> 02:26:48.972]  They never denied him anything.
[02:26:49.666 --> 02:26:53.525]  The day that he left, he said, Lindsey, I want to write a forward to your book.
[02:26:54.164 --> 02:26:56.626]  He said, I can hardly believe what I've seen and heard today.
[02:26:56.906 --> 02:27:01.390]  He said, I was sitting in the Senate of the State of Colorado when the men came from Washington, D.C.
[02:27:01.410 --> 02:27:09.857]  to brief us as state senators as to how their lines at the gas pump and the price of gasoline has gone from 30 cents a gallon to $1.50 a gallon.
[02:27:10.237 --> 02:27:20.145]  He said, from what I have seen and heard here this week from these top company, oil company executives, almost everything that I was told when I was sitting in the Senate of the State of Colorado
[02:27:20.465 --> 02:27:27.488]  Well, I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:27:27.528 --> 02:27:31.509]  We're going to come back and go over what you actually saw and heard in these meetings.
[02:27:31.569 --> 02:27:34.870]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.831 --> 02:27:36.751]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.231 --> 02:27:38.852]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.752 --> 02:27:42.433]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:51.112]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who's a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:27:51.252 --> 02:27:52.472]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[02:27:52.652 --> 02:27:53.213]  Thank you, Marvin.
[02:27:53.413 --> 02:27:56.754]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[02:27:56.934 --> 02:27:57.454]  Is that true?
[02:27:57.694 --> 02:27:58.675]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[02:27:58.715 --> 02:28:01.696]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[02:28:01.736 --> 02:28:01.956]  price.
[02:28:02.196 --> 02:28:04.277]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[02:28:04.297 --> 02:28:05.058]  They're very common.
[02:28:05.138 --> 02:28:08.320]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[02:28:08.380 --> 02:28:08.640]  price.
[02:28:08.900 --> 02:28:10.081]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[02:28:10.121 --> 02:28:12.503]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[02:28:12.723 --> 02:28:16.505]  Tamoxifen you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[02:28:16.545 --> 02:28:16.825]  price.
[02:28:17.186 --> 02:28:19.587]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[02:28:19.827 --> 02:28:21.849]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[02:28:21.889 --> 02:28:23.910]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[02:28:24.170 --> 02:28:29.092]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.
[02:28:29.352 --> 02:28:31.293]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.

[02:28:45.555 --> 02:28:48.576]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:48.896 --> 02:28:53.818]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.078 --> 02:28:58.439]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:07.623]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.843 --> 02:29:11.444]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.744 --> 02:29:16.791]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.071 --> 02:29:23.820]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.301 --> 02:29:24.842]  What about you?
[02:29:25.598 --> 02:29:30.941]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:29:45.552 --> 02:29:47.715]  Pam got some mud out of her three-year-old's shirt.
[02:29:48.115 --> 02:29:49.917]  Jason had a wine stain on his countertop.
[02:29:50.237 --> 02:29:50.698]  Now gone.
[02:29:50.918 --> 02:29:53.001]  Halloween makeup from Karen's kid got on the carpet.
[02:29:53.361 --> 02:29:53.782]  No trick.
[02:29:54.182 --> 02:29:54.863]  It's gone too.
[02:29:55.263 --> 02:29:56.505]  What do these people have in common?
[02:29:56.785 --> 02:30:00.549]  They've discovered the powerful bubble of technology in BioWalk Citrus Concentrate.
[02:30:00.750 --> 02:30:03.453]  Kelly brought a puppy home and it left a mess on the new carpet.
[02:30:03.673 --> 02:30:05.455]  Now her carpet still looks brand new.
[02:30:05.795 --> 02:30:10.103]  Friends said, it's the most effective pet odor removal product she's ever encountered.
[02:30:10.263 --> 02:30:11.646]  What do these people have in common?
[02:30:11.966 --> 02:30:16.314]  They've discovered the power of pods or pet accident wash-up solution from Bio-Ops.
[02:30:16.675 --> 02:30:18.859]  Have you discovered the Bio-Ops family of products?
[02:30:19.594 --> 02:30:22.015]  Just in for BioWox, their November special.
[02:30:22.175 --> 02:30:29.357]  You get two quarts of BioWox Citrus Concentrate, two dilution bottles and sprayers, and two 32-ounce bottles of pause for only $44.95.

[02:30:35.198 --> 02:30:36.459]  That's 866-246-6943 or visit BioWox.com.
[02:30:52.169 --> 02:30:54.791]  Okay, I know we've got a load of phone lines you've been holding forever.
[02:30:54.811 --> 02:30:56.312]  Your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[02:30:56.372 --> 02:31:03.477]  I want to give you a few case point examples of Lindsey Williams as the big corporation's basically chaplain.
[02:31:03.917 --> 02:31:10.361]  In there in the board meetings, hearing all of this, then even had people with the old company, top executives, help write his book.
[02:31:11.242 --> 02:31:13.423]  And he's got several books and several videos.
[02:31:13.723 --> 02:31:15.224]  Lindsey Williams, tell folks about those.
[02:31:16.225 --> 02:31:21.108]  Well, the videotape that we're talking about today is the energy non-crisis.
[02:31:22.121 --> 02:31:27.643]  But the people who control the world, the powers that be, are using many things in order to control us.
[02:31:27.663 --> 02:31:28.844]  They're using vaccinations.
[02:31:29.144 --> 02:31:37.006]  This flu thing, frenzy, couldn't get a flu shot, oh my goodness, please get my videotape on vaccinations.
[02:31:37.166 --> 02:31:41.908]  One hour long, two doctors even tell the story of how dangerous MMR and DPT is.
[02:31:42.568 --> 02:31:46.870]  Deadly new diseases, but for goodness sakes, the microbial mutations,
[02:31:47.566 --> 02:31:53.791]  And then my fourth videotape entitled, Torn from the Land, a heart-rending story of what's happening to our farmer.
[02:31:54.151 --> 02:31:56.513]  And they're controlling us at the grocery store.
[02:31:56.994 --> 02:32:06.701]  Let me give you, with every one of my videotapes that you purchase, a set of all four of my books, over 200 pages each, full color covers, beautifully done.
[02:32:07.242 --> 02:32:11.205]  And with every videotape, that means you can give them out as Christmas gifts this year.
[02:32:11.605 --> 02:32:13.307]  Now, let me go back to what happened.
[02:32:13.647 --> 02:32:15.949]  Oh well, first of all... Well, give the phone number out.
[02:32:16.573 --> 02:32:17.674]  Yeah, 800 number.
[02:32:17.714 --> 02:32:20.618]  That's all you need to do is call it, give them your credit card, they'll take care of it.
[02:32:20.638 --> 02:32:20.678]  800-321-2900.
[02:32:20.698 --> 02:32:20.838]  1-800-321-2900.
[02:32:20.978 --> 02:32:22.660]  And it is powerful info.
[02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:25.243]  I've read one of his books.
[02:32:25.263 --> 02:32:27.986]  Now, Lindsey, because I've got a bunch of calls here, not a lot of time left.
[02:32:38.172 --> 02:32:39.813]  I had you on about three years ago about this.
[02:32:40.273 --> 02:32:47.897]  Go over a few case point examples of you in these board meetings and they find all this oil and the phone rings and they say, hey, don't tell anybody about that oil.
[02:32:48.897 --> 02:32:53.560]  Okay, I walked into one one day and one of the men said to me, you want to see something exciting today?
[02:32:53.860 --> 02:32:55.160]  I said, I sure do.
[02:32:55.240 --> 02:32:57.361]  He said, well chaplain, come on, hop in my pickup truck.
[02:32:57.401 --> 02:33:00.483]  We drove out to the dock where the big flotilla comes in every year.
[02:33:01.207 --> 02:33:13.172]  And the man sat there, Mr. Jim Lawler by name, he was an executive with Alain Gritchfield, and he said, I want you to see, we're going to release some oil right now from what we think is the largest pool of oil on the face of the earth.
[02:33:13.592 --> 02:33:17.254]  And he said, we're going to prove it today, check the chemical analysis and so on.
[02:33:17.654 --> 02:33:23.196]  Well, he sat there a moment or two, a big plume of black smoke went up into the sky, that was back in the days when they let them do this.
[02:33:23.715 --> 02:33:27.097]  And in a few moments, he got so excited, he said, come on, let's get back to base camp.
[02:33:27.337 --> 02:33:31.719]  We got back to base camp, went up to Mr. Jim Lawler's and Mr. Ken Fromm's office.
[02:33:32.099 --> 02:33:40.303]  Here were all of the leading executives of BP and Atlantic Richfield standing around a table, so ecstatic, they could hardly stand themselves.
[02:33:40.763 --> 02:33:47.446]  And one of them looked up at me, Mr. Jim Lawler, I'm sorry, Mr. Ken Fromm, and he said, Lindsey, we have just done it.
[02:33:47.526 --> 02:33:48.987]  And I said, you've just done what?
[02:33:49.386 --> 02:33:53.027]  He said, we have just discovered the largest pool of oil on the face of the earth.
[02:33:53.067 --> 02:33:54.688]  He said, look at this perforation of the pipe.
[02:33:54.708 --> 02:33:55.888]  Look at the pressure of the field.
[02:33:56.188 --> 02:33:58.089]  He said, look at the chemical analysis of the oil.
[02:33:58.389 --> 02:34:00.329]  He didn't deny me anything.
[02:34:00.569 --> 02:34:02.290]  He showed it to me, all of it.
[02:34:02.630 --> 02:34:05.411]  He said, America is energy independent.
[02:34:05.711 --> 02:34:13.793]  The following day, he called me into his office, sat me down and said, Lindsey, I would suggest you not say anything about that any time too soon.
[02:34:14.213 --> 02:34:16.854]  He said, we have just classified that information.
[02:34:16.914 --> 02:34:19.095]  He said, we're not going to release that oil yet.
[02:34:19.477 --> 02:34:28.965]  He said, if the federal government knew what we have found out there, they would make the lease sale so high priced that even we as Atlantic Richfield couldn't afford to give it to the American people.
[02:34:29.005 --> 02:34:37.331]  And Alex, today, it does not cost them one penny more to produce that oil than it did back in the days when it was 35 cents a gallon.
[02:34:37.612 --> 02:34:48.040]  Yet you and I are paying at the gas pump to the World Bank, in a form of taxation, $2 a gallon at the gas pump, and every day at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska,
[02:34:48.715 --> 02:35:09.899]  There is one billion cubic feet of natural gas being pumped back into the ground that comes up with the oil because they will not allow the American people to have that natural gas to heat their homes and generate their electricity and there are 48 747 jet type engines pumping that back into the ground
[02:35:10.567 --> 02:35:11.688]  One billion.
[02:35:11.988 --> 02:35:13.109]  It's an atrocity.
[02:35:13.389 --> 02:35:15.151]  The American people ought to rise up and honor it.
[02:35:15.171 --> 02:35:16.352]  And then let me add to this.
[02:35:16.532 --> 02:35:19.354]  There's that type of oil in all the stands.
[02:35:19.855 --> 02:35:22.557]  Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan.
[02:35:23.097 --> 02:35:25.539]  There is at least three trillion dollars worth there.
[02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:27.401]  Four trillion in Iraq.
[02:35:27.801 --> 02:35:30.984]  Giant oil fields all over Russia.
[02:35:31.064 --> 02:35:33.346]  Giant oil fields all over South America.
[02:35:33.766 --> 02:35:36.048]  Giant oil fields all over the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:35:36.708 --> 02:35:41.250]  Oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil.
[02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:44.351]  And then we hear, oh, there's no oil.
[02:35:44.831 --> 02:35:45.872]  We're running out of oil.
[02:35:46.812 --> 02:35:47.773]  There is no shortage.
[02:35:47.913 --> 02:35:50.794]  Gasoline tomorrow at the gas pump could be $1 a gallon.
[02:35:51.114 --> 02:35:58.377]  I've also read, I've also read, it's admitted, Lindsey, that we don't get into the oil, the small amounts that are allowed out of Alaska.
[02:35:58.717 --> 02:36:03.799]  That's sold at reduced prices to China so they can de-industrialize us.
[02:36:04.474 --> 02:36:07.817]  Forty percent of the oil from the Prudhoe Bay oil field is going to Japan.
[02:36:07.857 --> 02:36:10.399]  The rest of it goes to the United States of America.
[02:36:10.459 --> 02:36:14.663]  That was by agreement between the oil people and the federal government.
[02:36:14.703 --> 02:36:19.006]  I've read that BP gets most of it, then it goes to China and Japan.
[02:36:19.066 --> 02:36:20.828]  BP bought out Atlantic Richfield.
[02:36:21.008 --> 02:36:23.810]  That, again, is a story that we could do an entire program on.
[02:36:23.890 --> 02:36:24.971]  I wish we had the time.
[02:36:25.852 --> 02:36:27.673]  BP is British Petroleum.
[02:36:27.713 --> 02:36:30.616]  They bought Atlantic Richfield here, what, about a year and a half ago?
[02:36:31.215 --> 02:36:37.981]  The American government should never have allowed a British company to own our oil on the North Slope of Alaska.
[02:36:38.361 --> 02:36:39.462]  It's an atrocity.
[02:36:39.482 --> 02:36:44.026]  Well, hey, we're going to have Arnold Schwarzenegger as our next president, Lord Bush says.
[02:36:44.967 --> 02:36:49.731]  Well, we've got some... Listen, I just checked the radio a moment ago.
[02:36:49.751 --> 02:36:52.253]  Oil last hour was $49.70.
[02:36:52.513 --> 02:36:54.735]  It's starting back up.
[02:36:54.855 --> 02:36:55.776]  Mark my words.
[02:36:56.216 --> 02:36:57.417]  Call me a prophet if you'd like.
[02:36:58.121 --> 02:37:02.722]  Alex, I mean literally now, you remember, this program today is prophetic.
[02:37:03.423 --> 02:37:16.947]  Mark my words, oil, or gasoline at the gas pump, is going to be three to four dollars per gallon in the near future, because the World Bank needs more money to squander in their third world country schemes.
[02:37:17.007 --> 02:37:20.528]  Well, the dollar's already been devalued, so it takes more dollars to buy the fuel.
[02:37:21.195 --> 02:37:30.639]  And it will be three to four dollars at the gas pump unless the American people, programs like yours, Alex, and others don't rise up in arms and the American people don't say we've had enough.
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:38.363]  If some congressman would just allow me to prove my chapter in my book, Energy Non-Crisis, go, I will blow your mind.
[02:37:38.403 --> 02:37:39.584]  Let me tell you how this came about.
[02:37:39.924 --> 02:37:45.246]  Mr. Ken Fromm, after my book, Energy Non-Crisis, was written in 1980, Atlantic Richfield fired him.
[02:37:45.306 --> 02:37:47.867]  They got so mad at him for allowing me to see this information.
[02:37:49.364 --> 02:37:52.546]  He called me one day on the phone and he said, Lindsey, I'm so angry I don't know what to do.
[02:37:52.626 --> 02:37:54.467]  I'm only a few years away from retirement.
[02:37:54.887 --> 02:37:56.708]  He said, would you let me rewrite your book?
[02:37:56.768 --> 02:38:01.351]  He said, there's just a few things in there that because you're a chaplain and not an oil man, you wrote it wrong.
[02:38:01.691 --> 02:38:06.934]  He rewrote my book, which we now have updated and enlarged, the Energy Non-Crisis.
[02:38:07.435 --> 02:38:15.499]  After he rewrote my book, they found out he did it, they hired him back, gave him a huge increase in salary, put him in the Houston office.
[02:38:15.719 --> 02:38:18.421]  Yeah, that was smart to shut him up.
[02:38:19.233 --> 02:38:20.494]  Oh, any way to shut him up.
[02:38:20.974 --> 02:38:22.556]  But this is the way these people work.
[02:38:22.916 --> 02:38:42.271]  And the American people, if they only realized that at the gas pump, you are being taxed $2 per gallon, $60 billion a year to the World Bank, and these are the people who are controlling our government, controlling our money, and $49.70 already started up.
[02:38:42.391 --> 02:38:45.153]  It is going to $3 to $4 per gallon, mark my words.
[02:38:45.173 --> 02:38:48.816]  Well, they've been paying $5, $6 a gallon in Europe for decades.
[02:38:49.336 --> 02:38:52.437]  And gold went up this morning two dollars in only three hours.
[02:38:52.857 --> 02:38:53.377]  Watch out!
[02:38:53.657 --> 02:38:55.978]  We are on the rise to something.
[02:38:55.998 --> 02:38:56.418]  No, I know.
[02:38:56.458 --> 02:38:58.658]  The dollar's imploding.
[02:38:59.038 --> 02:39:05.360]  Let's take a few... If the American people only knew the issues... A congressman came to me one day.
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:08.360]  We were on speaking tour in Texas together.
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:13.941]  And this congressman came to me and he said, Lindsey, I've heard you speak and he said, you're probably willing to do it.
[02:39:13.961 --> 02:39:16.242]  He said, if you're crazy enough to put it in a book,
[02:39:16.762 --> 02:39:19.565]  I'll dictate it to you on a cassette tape recorder.
[02:39:19.925 --> 02:39:20.306]  He did.
[02:39:20.726 --> 02:39:25.231]  And I put in my book, Syndrome of Control, how the people who control the world think.
[02:39:25.511 --> 02:39:32.238]  This man told me, he said, this congressman did, he said, I wouldn't put that, I wouldn't write that for anything in this world, but he said, if you're crazy enough to do it, do it.
[02:39:32.758 --> 02:39:45.921]  If I can only inform the people of how the powers that be think, they will be able to spare themselves and their household some horrible calamities in the future for what these people have in store for us.
[02:39:45.961 --> 02:39:47.281]  They have a plan for us.
[02:39:47.561 --> 02:39:54.943]  I heard them say, we have a right, a God-given right to control people because they haven't got sense enough to control themselves.
[02:39:55.726 --> 02:39:57.246]  Sounds like an Arnold quote in U.S.
[02:39:57.286 --> 02:39:58.147]  News & World Report.
[02:39:58.187 --> 02:39:59.067]  Let's take a look.
[02:39:59.107 --> 02:40:01.367]  There it is, right here in my book, Syndrome of Control.
[02:40:01.387 --> 02:40:02.888]  Let me give it to you as a gift.
[02:40:02.968 --> 02:40:04.768]  Only over 200-page book.
[02:40:04.808 --> 02:40:15.311]  Just call 800-321-2900 and ask them how you could get free, for every person on your Christmas gift list, a set of my books.
[02:40:15.951 --> 02:40:19.172]  I just feel such an urgency with what's happening in America.
[02:40:19.512 --> 02:40:21.132]  We must get this truth out.
[02:40:21.172 --> 02:40:24.073]  This program today, Alex, is probably the most
[02:40:26.083 --> 02:40:26.644]  What you would say?
[02:40:26.784 --> 02:40:29.185]  Prophetic program you'll have in a long time.
[02:40:30.005 --> 02:40:30.945]  Let's take a few calls.
[02:40:30.965 --> 02:40:33.406]  This will probably be all over the map that people have been holding forever.
[02:40:34.126 --> 02:40:35.007]  Who's up first here?
[02:40:36.427 --> 02:40:37.168]  Dave in Illinois.
[02:40:37.188 --> 02:40:38.408]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:40:38.428 --> 02:40:38.788]  Go ahead.
[02:40:39.268 --> 02:40:39.749]  Oh, Alex.
[02:40:40.229 --> 02:40:40.449]  Yes?
[02:40:40.829 --> 02:40:44.851]  I have all your videotapes, except for your new one, and I think they're all very good.
[02:40:44.871 --> 02:40:45.771]  Well, thank you.
[02:40:47.532 --> 02:40:50.533]  I've got one question that's got nothing to do with oil, but I do have a question on oil.
[02:40:52.079 --> 02:40:58.303]  Whatever happened to that group called themselves Aurelians that were actively seeking to clone a human being?
[02:40:58.944 --> 02:41:00.224]  I mean, this is total fraud.
[02:41:00.244 --> 02:41:01.445]  They just do it for attention.
[02:41:01.465 --> 02:41:06.168]  They're run by this nutcase sportscaster who says he's this alien ruler.
[02:41:06.809 --> 02:41:10.391]  And yeah, they're running around getting all this attention still saying they're cloning people.
[02:41:11.312 --> 02:41:11.672]  Okay.
[02:41:12.132 --> 02:41:15.895]  And you probably noticed, maybe you've seen the ads on TV where
[02:41:16.314 --> 02:41:22.058]  Shows these two actors and they start, you know, asking, you know, what, uh, what movie did I appear in and all this stuff.
[02:41:22.158 --> 02:41:29.242]  And they said, now, the last question is, now, uh, what, uh, kid, uh, you know, what, who sits next to your kid in homeroom and all like that?
[02:41:29.783 --> 02:41:38.949]  My thing is on that, it's almost impossible for the, the parents to know that because you got, uh, the Joe Six Pack and the Sally Soccer Mom mentality.
[02:41:39.329 --> 02:41:44.132]  Joe Six Pack works two jobs and when he gets home, he basically crashes and burns in his recliner.
[02:41:44.628 --> 02:41:45.648]  In front of the TV set.
[02:41:46.088 --> 02:41:49.469]  Sally's six pack, or Sally's soccer mom, she's got a job.
[02:41:49.509 --> 02:41:50.629]  She comes home most often.
[02:41:50.649 --> 02:41:52.410]  She's running the kids back and forth to school.
[02:41:52.830 --> 02:41:56.411]  So, probably the only time they get to be together is when they crash and burn and go to bed.
[02:41:57.291 --> 02:41:57.791]  I hear you.
[02:41:57.951 --> 02:41:59.172]  Do you have a question about oil?
[02:41:59.832 --> 02:42:00.132]  Yes.
[02:42:00.252 --> 02:42:01.712]  I got my driver's license in 1972.
[02:42:04.013 --> 02:42:08.174]  And of course, the fact that the big supposedly shortage was in what, 1973?
[02:42:09.881 --> 02:42:18.126]  And I've noticed that a lot of the gas stations that went out of business because of the shortage of gas, supposedly regular gas, were basically the bomb and pop operations.
[02:42:18.866 --> 02:42:26.171]  And they had barges all around the country loaded down the water line with tons of oil.
[02:42:26.651 --> 02:42:26.951]  Oh yeah!
[02:42:27.552 --> 02:42:29.833]  Yeah, the shortage was contrived back then.
[02:42:30.153 --> 02:42:32.815]  And they created a shortage in order to raise the price.
[02:42:32.955 --> 02:42:36.117]  Morgan Stanley, who is one of the greatest prognosticators,
[02:42:36.924 --> 02:42:37.285]  I think?
[02:42:53.553 --> 02:42:57.154]  We are on our way to $70 a barrel.
[02:42:57.574 --> 02:43:01.696]  Oil is up 75% since the first day of this year.
[02:43:01.716 --> 02:43:06.937]  It's actually, hold on, it's actually, oil prices are up over 90%.
[02:43:08.598 --> 02:43:10.118]  Well, in some parts of the country.
[02:43:10.919 --> 02:43:14.920]  One thing for sure, they're going to $3 to $4 per gallon and it's not going to be very long.
[02:43:16.261 --> 02:43:19.603]  Whatever happened to all the oil wells that are capped in this country?
[02:43:19.743 --> 02:43:22.225]  In Oklahoma and Texas and all that.
[02:43:22.345 --> 02:43:25.527]  And that oil is not being allowed to be pumped out of the ground either.
[02:43:25.587 --> 02:43:26.988]  What's happening there?
[02:43:27.748 --> 02:43:30.109]  Well, let's just take the North Slope of Alaska alone.
[02:43:30.430 --> 02:43:34.952]  We have one pool up there that's probably the largest pool of oil on the face of the earth.
[02:43:35.012 --> 02:43:39.075]  The only place in the world it's documented because they classified the information.
[02:43:39.700 --> 02:43:46.724]  Uh, after I wrote it, is in my book, The Energy Non-Crisis, Gull Island, and not one drop of it has ever been given to the American people.
[02:43:47.104 --> 02:43:51.967]  The Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline Corridor was built to accommodate three pipelines.
[02:43:52.027 --> 02:43:56.110]  They built one, and the government said, you positive will not build another.
[02:43:56.430 --> 02:44:02.033]  Yet, they wanted to double that amount of oil coming down the pipeline into America every day.
[02:44:02.518 --> 02:44:10.340]  And yet today we're being denied the natural gas that they wanted to come down a third pipeline and one billion cubic feet.
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:24.083]  Listen, the most, the least damaging to the ecology of any method of generating electricity is natural gas and one billion cubic feet are being pumped back into the ground every day at Pearl Bay, Alaska because there's no place to put it.
[02:44:24.103 --> 02:44:24.924]  Let's take another call.
[02:44:24.984 --> 02:44:26.004]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:26.704 --> 02:44:28.685]  Let's talk to Mike in Florida.
[02:44:28.745 --> 02:44:29.605]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:44:29.645 --> 02:44:30.005]  Go ahead.
[02:44:30.911 --> 02:44:34.372]  Yes, I've read Mr. Williams' books.
[02:44:34.472 --> 02:44:35.473]  I've got his video.
[02:44:35.973 --> 02:44:48.657]  And the price of barrel oil has to get up to about $70 a barrel in order to meet the standard of living and the value of the dollar back in 71.
[02:44:48.697 --> 02:44:51.438]  Is that right, Mr. Lindsay?
[02:44:52.129 --> 02:44:54.071]  Oh, it is a control factor.
[02:44:54.651 --> 02:44:58.974]  People say, why is it that the people who control the world are doing what they're doing?
[02:44:59.214 --> 02:44:59.675]  You're right.
[02:44:59.975 --> 02:45:04.978]  It must go to $70 to $80 a barrel in order to bring about the control factor that they want.
[02:45:05.399 --> 02:45:07.540]  People say, well, isn't it money that they're after?
[02:45:07.740 --> 02:45:08.721]  Positively not.
[02:45:08.801 --> 02:45:09.722]  They print the money.
[02:45:10.402 --> 02:45:12.284]  I sat across the dinner table from these people.
[02:45:12.324 --> 02:45:13.244]  I listened to them talk.
[02:45:13.325 --> 02:45:15.206]  I lived in the dorms with them for three years.
[02:45:16.247 --> 02:45:18.008]  They're the power controllers of the world.
[02:45:18.890 --> 02:45:20.471]  It's not money that they're after.
[02:45:20.491 --> 02:45:24.672]  They could write a check for a million dollars a day the rest of their life and still have some left over.
[02:45:25.192 --> 02:45:30.053]  It's a matter of control and power and manipulation of the people.
[02:45:30.354 --> 02:45:32.174]  And they can best control the Arabs.
[02:45:32.994 --> 02:45:35.155]  They can best control OPEC.
[02:45:35.455 --> 02:45:38.256]  They can best control the American people at the gas pump.
[02:45:38.576 --> 02:45:41.617]  It's the greatest control factor on the face of the earth.
[02:45:41.637 --> 02:45:42.097]  It is.
[02:45:42.137 --> 02:45:42.957]  I'll finish.
[02:45:42.977 --> 02:45:44.238]  Finish up what you were saying, Mike.
[02:45:46.107 --> 02:45:54.148]  What do you see as the future from today forward with the Arab and the American people?
[02:45:54.229 --> 02:45:54.931]  What's the plan?
[02:45:56.571 --> 02:46:00.094]  The plan was... Our plan is for the future, from today.
[02:46:00.114 --> 02:46:02.316]  Oh my, I wish I had another hour.
[02:46:03.117 --> 02:46:08.981]  Well, in a nutshell... The plan basically, in a nutshell, is you are exactly right in what you said just a moment ago.
[02:46:09.362 --> 02:46:10.863]  That barrel of oil is going to go up.
[02:46:10.983 --> 02:46:14.906]  OPEC does not want the price of a barrel of oil to increase anymore.
[02:46:15.067 --> 02:46:16.267]  Now, some people think they do.
[02:46:16.648 --> 02:46:18.950]  No, that is not the issue.
[02:46:20.071 --> 02:46:21.592]  The Saudi family
[02:46:22.713 --> 02:46:25.655]  The leaders are just about to be overthrown anyway.
[02:46:26.075 --> 02:46:27.276]  The people are mad at them.
[02:46:27.556 --> 02:46:27.836]  Why?
[02:46:28.276 --> 02:46:30.857]  Their standard of living is not where it should be.
[02:46:31.198 --> 02:46:33.619]  It's not the price of a barrel of oil that they want.
[02:46:33.659 --> 02:46:35.520]  They'd like to see it come down instead of go up.
[02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:44.084]  It's the World Bank that wants the price of that barrel of oil up so that they can control, that's the word, control everybody on the face of the earth.
[02:46:44.184 --> 02:46:47.326]  Mr. Williams, I feel like it's the clash of civilization.
[02:46:50.362 --> 02:46:53.143]  We have basically two banking systems in the world.
[02:46:53.864 --> 02:46:57.325]  And I went to school with Muslims and I understand they have a different outlook on money.
[02:46:58.186 --> 02:47:04.909]  And what I understand is that the Middle Eastern countries have their own banking, Muslim banking system.
[02:47:05.789 --> 02:47:12.693]  And they also dabble in the New York, Paris, and Bonn banks also with their oil money.
[02:47:13.273 --> 02:47:17.735]  But isn't this clash of civilizations that we hear, isn't it really about banking?
[02:47:18.334 --> 02:47:22.516]  And getting a one-world banking system is the most... Yeah, it's about control and consolidation.
[02:47:22.556 --> 02:47:23.616]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:24.116 --> 02:47:24.596]  I appreciate it.
[02:47:24.616 --> 02:47:25.977]  It is about banking, that's true.
[02:47:26.517 --> 02:47:28.058]  Let's talk to Charles in Florida.
[02:47:28.118 --> 02:47:29.018]  Charles, go ahead.
[02:47:32.580 --> 02:47:34.360]  Hi, this is actually Kevin in Boston.
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:35.261]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:47:35.481 --> 02:47:36.761]  Okay, Kevin, go ahead.
[02:47:37.842 --> 02:47:45.425]  I was wondering if Mr. Lindsey Williams was familiar with Colonel Fletcher Prouty, who died a couple of years back, but he had also been
[02:47:46.767 --> 02:48:08.975]  Involved in some of these oil barons meetings, where they talked, you know, in the late 70s, early 80s, about manufacturing, the downfall of the dollar, and the artificial oil crisis, and just reaffirming what Alex has said, that they're trying to create a false scarcity
[02:48:09.582 --> 02:48:21.650]  And that, you know, we could have small nuclear power plants like they had at the Arctic base that would be quite efficient, not like these monsters that are inefficient that they do use.
[02:48:21.810 --> 02:48:23.111]  I wish we had another hour.
[02:48:23.231 --> 02:48:30.776]  Please call 800-321-2900 and let me say everything we didn't have time to say.
[02:48:31.297 --> 02:48:31.797]  Alrighty.
[02:48:32.457 --> 02:48:35.479]  Okay, Lindsey Williams, thank you for joining us.
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:36.680]  I appreciate you coming on.
[02:48:36.700 --> 02:48:37.661]  We'll have to have you back up.
[02:48:38.234 --> 02:48:38.935]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:48:39.115 --> 02:48:40.476]  God bless you, and have a great day.
[02:48:40.496 --> 02:48:41.777]  You're doing a wonderful job.
[02:48:41.917 --> 02:48:42.357]  Take care.
[02:48:42.377 --> 02:48:43.638]  We'll come back to the final segment.
[02:48:45.699 --> 02:48:50.042]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.062 --> 02:48:54.626]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.786 --> 02:48:59.149]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.189 --> 02:49:00.570]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.330 --> 02:49:06.554]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.614 --> 02:49:13.540]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:15.762]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:15.942 --> 02:49:26.411]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.431 --> 02:49:27.432]  If you want to understand
[02:49:27.432 --> 02:49:28.833]  You understand what the new rule order really is?
[02:49:29.013 --> 02:49:32.054]  Then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[02:49:58.322 --> 02:50:03.008]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.468 --> 02:50:10.190]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:10.590 --> 02:50:22.394]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:22.834 --> 02:50:27.298]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:51:55.695 --> 02:51:56.895]  The site's about two weeks old.
[02:51:56.915 --> 02:51:57.856]  It's been redesigned.
[02:51:57.876 --> 02:51:59.896]  A lot of new information up there.
[02:51:59.996 --> 02:52:07.418]  President Bush, former President Bush, yesterday had Arnold to his presidential library and said, hey, don't bet against this guy.
[02:52:07.458 --> 02:52:08.678]  Here's going to be your president.
[02:52:10.778 --> 02:52:12.299]  I hope you support us in this fight.
[02:52:12.319 --> 02:52:14.039]  I hope you spread the word about ArnoldExposed.com.
[02:52:15.905 --> 02:52:18.868]  There's so many scams that are going on right now, my friends.
[02:52:19.128 --> 02:52:20.189]  I've made 11 films.
[02:52:20.349 --> 02:52:22.070]  We've got deals right now for Christmas.
[02:52:22.090 --> 02:52:23.612]  So you can give them as gifts.
[02:52:23.652 --> 02:52:33.100]  When you buy one of my DVDs, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, or the new film, American Dictators, you buy one for the regular price.
[02:52:33.240 --> 02:52:34.541]  Each additional is $5.95.
[02:52:34.982 --> 02:52:39.065]  You can buy four or five copies and give them as gifts.
[02:52:39.125 --> 02:52:41.827]  These are professionally produced videos.
[02:52:42.508 --> 02:52:43.549]  Looks like Discovery Channel.
[02:52:44.497 --> 02:52:45.938]  It's what people are used to looking at.
[02:52:45.978 --> 02:52:47.178]  That's why they're very effective.
[02:52:47.198 --> 02:52:49.259]  It's fast-moving, full of information.

[02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:03.789]  Just spread the gift of information.
[02:54:04.309 --> 02:54:06.910]  Please take action.
[02:54:06.930 --> 02:54:07.650]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:13.551]  Mark, or actually Mark's next.
[02:54:14.671 --> 02:54:16.992]  Let's go to Mary first in Colorado.
[02:54:17.032 --> 02:54:17.792]  Mary, go ahead.
[02:54:18.412 --> 02:54:25.053]  Well, there's four countries going to share the oil there when they get it into Turkey in that big pipeline.
[02:54:25.546 --> 02:54:27.728]  That Bush and the Russians.
[02:54:28.088 --> 02:54:29.409]  The Russians and the U.S.
[02:54:29.629 --> 02:54:30.290]  are two of them.
[02:54:30.850 --> 02:54:35.574]  I suppose, I've probably forgotten the other two, but one of them was an Arab country, so it'd be Iraq.
[02:54:35.994 --> 02:54:39.217]  Israel's gonna get some.
[02:54:39.617 --> 02:54:40.638]  Oh, I don't doubt that.
[02:54:40.718 --> 02:54:42.359]  No, that's public.
[02:54:42.799 --> 02:54:44.881]  Oh yeah, they think they're privileged people.
[02:54:45.341 --> 02:54:47.243]  But anyway, they're not all bad.
[02:54:48.184 --> 02:54:54.949]  But anyhow, this is the excuse for killing all those people that they've killed over there, and it makes me sick
[02:54:55.444 --> 02:55:02.668]  When I think about the Americans that have been killed over there, and the good Iraqis.
[02:55:02.728 --> 02:55:05.290]  They're so inept, that Bush family.
[02:55:05.370 --> 02:55:08.092]  Anything to look big and important, that's their thing.
[02:55:08.112 --> 02:55:09.613]  Okay?
[02:55:10.333 --> 02:55:12.935]  No, I agree with you, but they're just high-level puppets.
[02:55:12.975 --> 02:55:13.635]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:14.135 --> 02:55:16.177]  Fred in Pennsylvania, go ahead, last caller.
[02:55:16.557 --> 02:55:19.519]  Hi, I just wanted to say that the guests should
[02:55:21.132 --> 02:55:26.296]  To consider collaborating with Gene Manning and Nick Begich on another book.
[02:55:26.316 --> 02:55:33.842]  It seems like he's got overflow of information enough for a whole stack of new books.
[02:55:34.162 --> 02:55:35.303]  This guy's a great author.
[02:55:37.981 --> 02:55:44.005]  Oh, he's an interesting fella, and the information in his non-energy crisis book, I mean, a lot of it's already public from other sources.
[02:55:44.045 --> 02:55:49.129]  I mean, they got plenty of oil, but there is an energy crisis because they're going to create an energy crisis.
[02:55:49.209 --> 02:56:04.600]  Right, you don't have a contradiction between the stamp out of information on free energy and the fact that there is a hiding of the petroleum assets.
[02:56:05.100 --> 02:56:06.401]  There's no contradiction there.
[02:56:07.099 --> 02:56:08.539]  There's both of those going on.
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:10.880]  I hear you.
[02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:11.720]  Thanks for the call.
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:18.981]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on the shortwave at 3210 or on your local AM or FM station.
[02:56:19.602 --> 02:56:30.904]  The Internet at Infowars.com and during the day at 9.985 and of course at the Internet at Infowars.com or on your local AM or FM station.
[02:56:31.304 --> 02:56:35.705]  All the sponsors, the listeners, the folks running the show, to all of you, thank you so much.
