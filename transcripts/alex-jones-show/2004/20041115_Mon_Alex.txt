[00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.653]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:11.174]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:12.735]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:17.098]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:21.722]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:39.663]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:44.426]  It is Monday, the 15th day of November 2004.
[00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:48.468]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:58.094]  Well, if you read the newspaper this weekend or turned on local or national television, you heard how Arnold needs to be our next president, how a group
[00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:00.496]  Well, no affiliation with him.
[00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:14.330]  No, it's just a bunch of his top campaign people and minions are going to run TV ads starting in California and then nationwide saying, amend the second article of the Constitution, get rid of the 22nd Amendment for Arnold!
[00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:18.534]  Arnold's had Jay Leno, John McCain, Ted Kennedy,
[00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:26.578]  He's had Dana Rohrabacher, Orrin Hatch, all out there pitching this all over the news for the last three weeks.
[00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:33.701]  And Dana Rohrabacher, a few weeks ago, lied and said, no, no, we're trying to amend it for other people that are foreign born.
[00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:34.741]  This isn't for Arnold.
[00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:42.665]  Well, now we found an article in the San Jose Mercury News from last week where he said, no, it is for Arnold.
[00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:46.086]  The Republicans want him to be the next president.
[00:01:47.057 --> 00:01:49.259]  So now it's official in your face.
[00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:54.684]  For all of you out there in denial about this, it's been obvious all along.
[00:01:57.086 --> 00:01:58.867]  The guy says he admires Hitler.
[00:01:59.408 --> 00:02:00.869]  He loves Kirk of all time.
[00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:02.210]  He doesn't care if he's a Nazi.
[00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:04.032]  He hates black people.
[00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:05.093]  He said it publicly.
[00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:11.859]  He's an admitted steroid head, posing for homosexual magazines, groping women in mass.
[00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:15.993]  On, and on, and on, and on, and on.
[00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:19.716]  And the media just totally ignores it or says, oh, well that was in his past.
[00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:20.356]  He's good.
[00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:23.499]  He's doubled the deficit of California.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.760]  He wants your guns.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.841]  He's for open borders.
[00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:28.743]  He's for stem cell research and abortion.
[00:02:29.363 --> 00:02:35.608]  Conservatives love him, at least the so-called conservatives running our government.
[00:02:35.728 --> 00:02:38.810]  Major polls, the World Net Daily had one.
[00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.031]  1.7% of people are for Arnold.
[00:02:42.757 --> 00:02:44.617]  Biggest percentage for Rudolph Giuliani.
[00:02:45.038 --> 00:02:46.418]  But the elite doesn't care.
[00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:47.298]  They're pushing Arnold.
[00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:50.859]  But in national polls, eight-tenths of the average American and what?
[00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.040]  Two-thirds of conservatives are against Arnold.
[00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:05.402]  But don't count on that once they're done with their spin machine and their electronic voting machines.
[00:03:06.962 --> 00:03:08.243]  Look for Arnold in 08 or 012.
[00:03:10.527 --> 00:03:14.750]  And really, this is a big story because it's indicative of how far we've slid.
[00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:17.852]  I mean, how humiliating is this?
[00:03:18.212 --> 00:03:24.196]  No other country would even put up with the suggestion of a foreigner being their President or Prime Minister.
[00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:32.681]  Only in America would we have the politicians going against the Constitution, against common sense, and against the polls.
[00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:37.724]  All of them, Democrats, Republicans, just basically all of them are for Arnold.
[00:03:38.357 --> 00:03:42.821]  Because the Rothschilds and Warren Buffett and all these elites are.
[00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:49.227]  And so, Paul Watson and myself have written a couple of detailed stories about this.
[00:03:49.627 --> 00:03:51.168]  I just wrote another one this morning.
[00:03:51.468 --> 00:03:55.312]  It's going up on InfoWars.com in the next 20 minutes or so.
[00:03:55.452 --> 00:03:58.314]  I wrote one with Paul Watson and his brother last night.
[00:03:58.394 --> 00:04:02.938]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com right now on the right hand side.
[00:04:02.978 --> 00:04:04.360]  It's one of the small links.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.861]  We need to get a bigger link up there for it.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:18.710]  This is the reality, and I'm begging you as listeners to go out and to get these stories we've written and to email them to every news agency, every talk show host, everybody!
[00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.072]  We've got to expose this guy!
[00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:24.114]  A person who on Hollywood sets in the 90's!
[00:04:24.895 --> 00:04:32.041]  If somebody isn't good looking, he makes them get down, calls them a dog, makes them say they're an ugly dog, makes them beg,
[00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:34.046]  That's why the elite love him.
[00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:38.247]  He is a scumbag elitist who loves dehumanizing people.
[00:04:38.267 --> 00:04:40.808]  In fact, I've got a bunch of his quotes here.
[00:04:42.609 --> 00:04:44.130]  I've got a whole bunch of his quotes.
[00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.092]  Where he talks about how we're the little people, how we're the slaves.
[00:04:50.052 --> 00:04:51.673]  It is so sick.
[00:04:53.014 --> 00:04:54.374]  Alright, there is so much news.
[00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:55.795]  We'll get off Arnold here in a second.
[00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:57.636]  We'll cover all the incredible news.
[00:04:57.696 --> 00:04:58.316]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:07.790]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:09.472]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.652 --> 00:05:11.874]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.014 --> 00:05:14.115]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:19.320]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.643]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:23.943 --> 00:05:25.705]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:36.433]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.593 --> 00:05:38.455]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.771]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:05.895]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:10.320]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.561]  So what do you do?
[00:06:11.882 --> 00:06:16.467]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:16.947 --> 00:06:19.068]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:19.548 --> 00:06:34.253]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:41.356]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:02.352]  Pam got some mud out of her three-year-old's shirt.
[00:07:02.752 --> 00:07:04.532]  Jason had a wine stain on his countertop.
[00:07:04.852 --> 00:07:05.312]  Now gone.
[00:07:05.552 --> 00:07:07.633]  Halloween makeup from Karen's kid got on the carpet.
[00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:08.413]  No trick.
[00:07:08.813 --> 00:07:09.473]  It's gone, too.
[00:07:09.893 --> 00:07:11.114]  What do these people have in common?
[00:07:11.414 --> 00:07:15.175]  They've discovered the powerful bubble-up technology in BioWax Citrus Concentrate.
[00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:18.075]  Kelly brought a puppy home and it left a mess on the new carpet.
[00:07:18.276 --> 00:07:20.056]  Now her carpet still looks brand new.
[00:07:20.416 --> 00:07:24.719]  Friends said, it's the most effective pet odor removal product she's ever encountered.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.361]  What did these people have encountered?
[00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:30.944]  They've discovered the power of pods or pet accident wash-up solutions from Bio-Ox.
[00:07:31.304 --> 00:07:33.466]  Have you discovered the Bio-Ox family of products?
[00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:36.637]  Just in from BioWox, their November special.
[00:07:36.797 --> 00:07:44.020]  You get two quarts of BioWox Citrus Concentrate, two dilution bottles and sprayers, and two 32-ounce bottles of pause for only $44.95.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.241]  That's a savings of nearly $45.
[00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:49.782]  Clean your house in time for the holidays by calling 866-246-6943.
[00:07:49.822 --> 00:07:51.083]  That's 866-246-6943 or visit BioWox.com.
[00:08:02.313 --> 00:08:08.355]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:11.995]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.317 --> 00:08:25.699]  It is publicly admitted that the government blew up at least Building 7.
[00:08:28.015 --> 00:08:48.146]  On the afternoon of September 11, 2001, and now we have the clip in the WTC section of PrisonPlanet.com, where the designer of the towers says that it was meant to accept multiple strikes by large jets, large passenger jets.
[00:08:48.607 --> 00:08:54.550]  We also have the certifiers of the steel for the World Trade Center saying it would take 3,000 degrees
[00:08:58.118 --> 00:09:02.123]  The collapse that they're claiming is impossible.
[00:09:04.225 --> 00:09:06.528]  That is a new development that just came out.
[00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:11.694]  As more people look at the official FEMA report and the ridiculous claims that are made,
[00:09:12.449 --> 00:09:18.656]  More and more engineers, people involved in the construction of it are saying it is a fraud.
[00:09:19.036 --> 00:09:30.469]  Firefighter Engineering, the oldest firefighting organization and publication in the country, the month after 9-11 said it was all a fraud and that they were destroying the crime scene and hauling it away and that bombs had to do it.
[00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:39.635]  But now we have the owner saying they blew it up, we have the seismographs, we have firefighters saying they were told to get the media back, that they were about to bring down the building.
[00:09:40.015 --> 00:09:46.677]  That's all on the WTC7 section of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:53.700]  And it is so important that we email this out to everyone.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.441]  We'll be getting into Arnold Schwarzenegger,
[00:09:57.879 --> 00:10:11.064]  And this group, AmendForArnold.com, who want to get rid of Article 2 of the Constitution and the 22nd Amendment that will also allow Bill Clinton and others to run for President again.
[00:10:11.864 --> 00:10:13.004]  It does a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:14.985]  We'll be covering that.
[00:10:16.085 --> 00:10:17.966]  We'll get into the battle for Fallujah.
[00:10:18.006 --> 00:10:22.087]  There is just so much here that we'll be covering.
[00:10:22.628 --> 00:10:23.408]  Some good news, too.
[00:10:24.938 --> 00:10:28.861]  Senator Marshall's effort to stop National ID Card legislation.
[00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:30.702]  It's out of the Michigan News.
[00:10:30.722 --> 00:10:33.984]  50 organizations come together to denounce Big Brother.
[00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:39.707]  Right now, the conference committee of the House and Senate Republicans is deciding whether or not to do the unthinkable.
[00:10:40.127 --> 00:10:49.313]  They will impose a National ID Card on the citizens of the United States, warns Tom DeWeese, President of the American Policy Center, adding, they must hear from us.
[00:10:49.753 --> 00:10:52.715]  A National ID Card would be Big Brother at its worst.
[00:10:53.419 --> 00:11:03.122]  The entire lives of every American, including medical history, job history, marital history, financial history, credit history, everything could end up on the central federal database.
[00:11:03.702 --> 00:11:08.784]  Data about your entire life would be at the fingertips of faceless bureaucrats.
[00:11:09.344 --> 00:11:11.725]  It's going to be used for you to be able to even have a job.
[00:11:12.392 --> 00:11:27.961]  There is no greater threat to our personal security and liberty than a national ID system, says DeWeese, who is calling on supporters of the center to contact seven key senators and five key representatives, all Republicans, to have an ID card language stripped from S-2845 and HR-10.
[00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:28.541]  We've got
[00:11:33.914 --> 00:11:37.196]  Tom DeWeese and others, of course, coming on the broadcast later this week.
[00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:43.018]  As we have Tom Tancredo, Congressman Ron Paul, Congressman and many others.
[00:11:44.119 --> 00:11:47.581]  Fort Bragg Troops Trained for Homeland Security Mission.
[00:11:49.422 --> 00:11:51.543]  This is a very scary article.
[00:11:51.783 --> 00:11:52.743]  Regular Army.
[00:11:54.804 --> 00:11:57.565]  There is just so much that is coming up.
[00:11:57.585 --> 00:11:58.446]  But let me first
[00:11:59.227 --> 00:12:01.068]  I just want to say that I have this frothing drive
[00:12:27.463 --> 00:12:41.788]  This frantic drive, so much corruption, so much evil, so much hypocrisy, so many people dumbed down, being conned and abused, as this country is being dismantled and wrecked right in front of us.
[00:12:41.868 --> 00:12:45.749]  And I have just this drive to expose it and warn people.
[00:12:46.249 --> 00:12:52.411]  I mean, if you saw your neighbor being robbed and saw a truck backed up to it, loading their TVs and computers on it,
[00:12:53.084 --> 00:12:53.865]  And the jewelry?
[00:12:54.465 --> 00:12:59.088]  Uh, wouldn't you have a, you know, that adrenaline rush to call the police or to go out there and confront them?
[00:12:59.748 --> 00:13:01.509]  With your firearm and to stop them?
[00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.811]  Well, I see our whole future being stolen.
[00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:06.492]  Our freedoms being destroyed.
[00:13:07.033 --> 00:13:09.814]  And I just... There's so much I want to articulate.
[00:13:09.934 --> 00:13:10.955]  So much I want to do.
[00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:12.876]  So much I want to warn you about.
[00:13:13.777 --> 00:13:20.801]  And I see so many people conned by the mainstream media, buying into the tyranny, and so many that are waking up who feel powerless.
[00:13:21.261 --> 00:13:22.382]  But those that laugh at us,
[00:13:23.396 --> 00:13:30.183]  You know, these yuppies who just think because they accept everything and only care about themselves that somehow they get ahead that way.
[00:13:30.264 --> 00:13:30.824]  You don't!
[00:13:33.928 --> 00:13:35.709]  Our society is being destroyed!
[00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.271]  And you're being conned!
[00:13:37.311 --> 00:13:38.432]  And you're being abused!
[00:13:38.492 --> 00:13:42.417]  And your children's futures are being erased!
[00:13:46.775 --> 00:13:48.076]  I mean, there's so much happening.
[00:13:48.096 --> 00:13:51.179]  We've got this casual society control grid going in.
[00:13:51.219 --> 00:13:54.522]  We've got the children being trained how to be prisoners with ID cards.
[00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:57.004]  We've got national ID card systems going in.
[00:13:57.304 --> 00:14:02.189]  Face scanning cameras and license plate scanning systems going in in every rural area.
[00:14:02.589 --> 00:14:03.430]  The big cities.
[00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.813]  We've got the police and military militarizing against us.
[00:14:06.873 --> 00:14:08.434]  We've got open borders.
[00:14:08.474 --> 00:14:12.158]  We've got cloning being totally legalized in two states.
[00:14:14.085 --> 00:14:16.187]  To keep the clones alive even after birth?
[00:14:16.707 --> 00:14:18.589]  After they're grown inside a surrogate mother?
[00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:23.033]  I mean, just all this is going on and the average person has no idea it's going on.
[00:14:23.413 --> 00:14:35.484]  Pharmacological corn being planted with live AIDS virus in it, spreading, Associated Press just... You know, I told my wife last night, I said, honey, it's like we're living in the Twilight Zone.
[00:14:35.504 --> 00:14:37.325]  I mean, I really mean it.
[00:14:37.806 --> 00:14:38.947]  It's so bizarre.
[00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:44.461]  And I said, let's get a babysitter, let's go see The Incredibles.
[00:14:45.261 --> 00:14:47.822]  I hear it's a good movie, and I deserve an escape.
[00:14:49.163 --> 00:14:53.445]  And I got reminded of the New World Order going and watching The Incredibles, which is an incredible movie.
[00:14:54.486 --> 00:14:55.946]  It's pretty good, folks, I recommend it.
[00:14:56.687 --> 00:15:09.353]  But I don't want to give the whole movie away, but just like the Washington Post wrote an analysis of how Attack of the Clones mirrored reality, and there was another article, it was at USA Today, about how
[00:15:10.097 --> 00:15:16.880]  Return of the King, mirrored reality, you know, with the all-seeing eye, the total information, awareness network, a God-like power.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:24.923]  I've got a Pentagon article here where they call it God-like omnipresent power, where they're going to know everything we do in track and traces.
[00:15:25.743 --> 00:15:29.205]  I always talk about these connections first and the media picks up on it.
[00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:31.686]  So look for an article soon about the Incredibles.
[00:15:32.986 --> 00:15:34.527]  There's this evil
[00:15:38.058 --> 00:15:51.084]  mogul weapons dealer who wants to be a superhero himself and so he carries out terror attacks and then he comes to the rescue and saves everyone so he can then be the savior.
[00:15:51.365 --> 00:15:52.525]  There, I've given the whole movie away.
[00:15:53.606 --> 00:16:02.670]  You can hate me, but reality is more important than this movie, but my point is children's movies, children can understand this.
[00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.391]  You know, Attack of the Clones.
[00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:14.234]  The Emperor hires Count Dooku, really Darth Tyranus, to go create crises so the Empire can be built up and they can destroy liberties.
[00:16:15.154 --> 00:16:16.775]  Same thing with the Incredibles.
[00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:19.276]  Children can understand this.
[00:16:19.816 --> 00:16:21.617]  Adults have trouble with it.
[00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:29.199]  I don't even know why I'm talking about it.
[00:16:29.259 --> 00:16:34.501]  I was just trying to have a little fun, go see a movie, and the New World Order stares me in the face.
[00:16:35.289 --> 00:16:43.442]  And speaking of reality and unreality, Arnold Schwarzenegger, elite push for Schwarzenegger presidency gains momentum.
[00:16:45.466 --> 00:16:48.610]  There's no end to the level of which our humiliation reaches.
[00:16:50.487 --> 00:16:52.348]  having this foreigner thrown in our face.
[00:16:52.868 --> 00:17:02.712]  As Alex has relentlessly documented, there is an establishment move, an unfolding agenda, to have Arnold Schwarzenegger run for the presidency in 2008 against Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:03.252 --> 00:17:07.934]  They've got to run him against somebody who's overwhelmingly unpopular so we can win, just like Ray Davis.
[00:17:07.954 --> 00:17:14.536]  Schwarzenegger's campaign contributors and the corporate media are complicit in pushing the amendment of Article 2 of the U.S.
[00:17:14.556 --> 00:17:17.357]  Constitution, which would allow Arnold to run for office.
[00:17:17.597 --> 00:17:18.778]  And now, Lisa
[00:17:19.801 --> 00:17:38.214]  Morgenthaler Jones, you disgrace the name of Jones, a mutual fund manager from the Bay Area and major donor to Schwarzenegger campaign, has set up a large-scale ad blitz to try to convince an army of mind slaves to form an Arnie cult and rally behind the Schwarzenegger 08 ticket.
[00:17:38.534 --> 00:17:39.395]  And they openly say this.
[00:17:39.895 --> 00:17:46.840]  This despite the fact that the current polls show Americans to be overwhelmingly, 80 plus percent, against having a foreign-born president.
[00:17:47.722 --> 00:17:52.463]  Recently, calls have gone to amend the Constitution in order to allow foreign-born citizens to run for President.
[00:17:53.023 --> 00:18:01.005]  A hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 7th was titled, Maximizing Voter Choice, Opening the Presidency to Naturalized Americans.
[00:18:01.305 --> 00:18:07.386]  The movement is being pushed by Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican Utah, who dubs it the Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment.
[00:18:07.766 --> 00:18:09.726]  Everyone else is calling it the Arnold Bill.
[00:18:10.127 --> 00:18:14.467]  Hatch is a globalist puppet, and a whole article could be written on him alone, but let's stick to Arnold.
[00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:16.868]  It's a six-page article, I can't read it all.
[00:18:18.453 --> 00:18:24.094]  Most recently, a Schwarzenegger group has produced a series of TV ads with the slogan, Amend for Arnold.
[00:18:24.434 --> 00:18:29.075]  The public is being exposed to the idea so it could become a reality in four or eight years time.
[00:18:29.495 --> 00:18:32.916]  Schwarzenegger is a compromised character.
[00:18:32.976 --> 00:18:37.957]  The elite only ever empower those that they know they have control over and can break at any time.
[00:18:38.297 --> 00:18:40.257]  Therefore, he is another perfect candidate.
[00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.978]  Then we did tale of hyperlinks, the sexual harassment,
[00:18:44.768 --> 00:18:47.810]  And much more, 16 year old girls, you name it.
[00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:54.674]  Drugs and pornography, marijuana, steroids, homosexual porn mags.
[00:18:55.572 --> 00:18:56.692]  And we get into all that.
[00:18:57.232 --> 00:18:58.653]  Racism and Nazi links.
[00:18:58.693 --> 00:19:00.013]  Saying he hates black people.
[00:19:00.073 --> 00:19:01.193]  Saying he loves Hitler.
[00:19:01.513 --> 00:19:02.414]  Admires Hitler.
[00:19:03.314 --> 00:19:04.854]  Saying, just it goes on and on.
[00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:05.974]  A huge section on that.
[00:19:06.274 --> 00:19:07.755]  The Enron connections covered.
[00:19:08.995 --> 00:19:12.276]  He advocates abortion and stem cell research.
[00:19:12.476 --> 00:19:13.636]  His elite connections.
[00:19:13.916 --> 00:19:14.956]  The Bohemian Grove.
[00:19:15.016 --> 00:19:15.876]  Warren Buffet.
[00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:18.937]  Lord, he really is Lord Rothschild.
[00:19:19.837 --> 00:19:20.938]  Got the Scotsman article.
[00:19:21.638 --> 00:19:22.638]  Then we have his quotes.
[00:19:23.616 --> 00:19:29.340]  I wanted to be part of a small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.023]  I think it's because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential.
[00:19:33.303 --> 00:19:36.085]  I was always fascinated with people in control of other people.
[00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:39.968]  I look down on people who are wanting, who are helpless.
[00:19:40.808 --> 00:19:41.949]  That's the ultimate power.
[00:19:42.209 --> 00:19:45.532]  Your vocabulary, how you communicate, study vocabulary.
[00:19:45.792 --> 00:19:50.175]  The more words you have, the better you can communicate, and the quicker you can put somebody away.
[00:19:51.656 --> 00:19:52.857]  Then we have all the rest of it.
[00:19:52.877 --> 00:19:55.098]  I'll finish up with this nightmare when we get back.
[00:19:56.119 --> 00:19:58.741]  Play the ad that's running in California right now.
[00:19:59.241 --> 00:20:00.102]  Then we'll get into all the rest.
[00:20:01.204 --> 00:20:01.625]  Gold.
[00:20:01.985 --> 00:20:03.266]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:03.526 --> 00:20:09.612]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:20:09.812 --> 00:20:13.616]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:20:13.977 --> 00:20:15.878]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:20:15.918 --> 00:20:18.221]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:24.707]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets
[00:20:24.827 --> 00:20:25.207]  We're good.
[00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:46.847]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[00:20:47.168 --> 00:20:49.771]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:56.097]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.

[00:21:00.502 --> 00:21:02.083]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:02.483 --> 00:21:08.204]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:08.465 --> 00:21:13.606]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:13.946 --> 00:21:16.427]  The self-sterilizing black murky elements remove
[00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:17.087]  We're good to go!
[00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:44.187]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:11.229]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:21.998]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:22:22.899 --> 00:22:29.484]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[00:22:30.453 --> 00:22:39.299]  We would like to send you a one-year, absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.

[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.201]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[00:23:03.561 --> 00:23:06.081]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:13.403]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:23:13.563 --> 00:23:16.844]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:19.144]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:23:19.464 --> 00:23:27.286]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:23:27.566 --> 00:23:28.847]  Either way, why chance it?
[00:23:28.927 --> 00:23:38.914]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[00:23:50.321 --> 00:23:50.882]  That's 877-835-5555 or visit
[00:23:57.986 --> 00:24:13.212]  Alright my friends, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:13.272 --> 00:24:16.853]  People just need to know that Lisa Morgenthaler-Jones
[00:24:18.982 --> 00:24:29.851]  was the first person to sign on officially to Arnold's campaign as the head of his finance committee the day after he announced on Jay Leno's program last year.
[00:24:32.633 --> 00:24:41.401]  And of course on top of all of this he's had all his minions from Ted Kennedy to John McCain
[00:24:42.871 --> 00:24:48.875]  On television, telling us what a great idea this would all be, to let a foreigner be our president.
[00:24:50.837 --> 00:24:58.462]  And then now, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher tells the newspaper, yes, this is for Arnold, yes, Republicans want him to be the next president.
[00:24:58.582 --> 00:25:03.245]  I mean, he's quoted as telling the local California newspaper that last week.
[00:25:04.867 --> 00:25:09.430]  And now they're going to run ads, it's a four-year plan to start in California, the national ads,
[00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:22.928]  With Arnold parties and Arnold visiting all over the country and people running with torches like the Olympics across to the 38 states to get the amendments changed.
[00:25:23.428 --> 00:25:24.229]  Here's the problem.
[00:25:24.849 --> 00:25:26.250]  People don't think this is going to happen.
[00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.191]  They keep denying it.
[00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:31.053]  The elite's been throwing this in our face for decades that Arnold will be president one day.
[00:25:32.454 --> 00:25:33.795]  It's just an ongoing joke.
[00:25:33.835 --> 00:25:34.676]  A joke on us.
[00:25:34.736 --> 00:25:36.157]  And if they can do this, they can do anything.
[00:25:38.579 --> 00:25:42.362]  And so, fight back against Arnold and his big money and his minions.
[00:25:42.602 --> 00:25:45.644]  Fight back against how hypocritical all of this is.
[00:25:46.685 --> 00:25:49.267]  And expose what he's really into to everybody.
[00:25:49.687 --> 00:25:51.208]  Go to Infowars.com.
[00:25:51.248 --> 00:25:52.529]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:52.849 --> 00:25:55.010]  Get the articles we've written and get them out to everybody.
[00:25:55.591 --> 00:25:59.374]  And again, we'll get more into Arnold just a little bit later.
[00:26:04.091 --> 00:26:10.594]  WTC construction certifiers say towers should have easily withstood jet fuel temperatures.
[00:26:14.276 --> 00:26:17.538]  And this is from Kevin Ryan, Underwriters Laboratories.
[00:26:18.318 --> 00:26:24.341]  The following letter was sent today by Kevin Ryan of Underwriters Laboratories to Frank Gale.
[00:26:25.066 --> 00:26:35.135]  of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, Underwriters Laboratories, is the company that certified the steel components used in the construction of the World Trade Center Towers.
[00:26:35.455 --> 00:26:37.537]  The information in this letter is of great importance.
[00:26:39.198 --> 00:26:45.964]  Dr. Gale, having recently reviewed your team's report on 10-19-04, I felt the need to contact you directly.
[00:26:46.224 --> 00:26:52.229]  As I am sure you know, the company I work for certified the steel components used in the construction of the WTC buildings.
[00:26:52.876 --> 00:27:06.386]  And requesting information from both our CEO and Fire Protection Business Manager last year, I learned that they did not agree on the essential aspects of the story, except for one thing, that the samples were certified and met all requirements.
[00:27:06.426 --> 00:27:15.172]  They suggested we be able to patent and understand the samples and that they met all requirements.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.161]  Again, it continues.
[00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:25.908]  They suggested that we all be patient and understand that the UL was working with your team and the test should continue through this year.
[00:27:26.469 --> 00:27:33.115]  I'm aware of UL's attempts to help, including performing tests on models of floor assemblages.
[00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:43.404]  But the result of these tests appears to indicate that the building should have easily withstood the thermal stress caused by pools of burning jet fuel.
[00:27:44.719 --> 00:27:50.803]  So, again, they told all the engineers that magically jet fuel melted steel, and they said, let's do tests.
[00:27:51.183 --> 00:27:53.104]  They said, well, the tests show what we already knew.
[00:27:53.445 --> 00:27:54.325]  This is impossible.
[00:27:54.425 --> 00:27:55.086]  He continues.
[00:27:55.786 --> 00:28:00.789]  There continues to be a number of experts making public claims about how the WTC buildings fell.
[00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:11.316]  One such person, Dr. Heyman Brown, from the WTC construction crew, claims that the buildings collapsed due to fires at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, melting the steel.
[00:28:11.969 --> 00:28:18.534]  He states that what caused the buildings to collapse is the airplane fuel burning at 2000 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:28:18.955 --> 00:28:21.257]  The steel in that five-floor area melts.
[00:28:21.317 --> 00:28:27.962]  Additionally, the newspaper quotes him as saying, just released primary findings from the National Institute of Standards Technology.
[00:28:28.283 --> 00:28:30.765]  Study of the World Trade Center collapse supports Brown's theory.
[00:28:31.485 --> 00:28:34.848]  We know that the steel components were certified ASTM E119
[00:28:36.761 --> 00:28:43.927]  The time-temperature curves for this standard require that samples to be exposed to temperatures around 2,000 Fahrenheit for several hours.
[00:28:44.067 --> 00:28:48.030]  As we will agree, the steel applied met those specifications.
[00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:58.438]  Additionally, I think we can agree that even un-fireproof steel will not melt until reaching red-hot temperatures of nearly 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:28:58.938 --> 00:29:06.404]  Why Mr. Brown would imply that 2,000 Fahrenheit would melt high-grade steel using those buildings makes no sense at all.
[00:29:08.254 --> 00:29:11.817]  Again, I'm sorry I'm babbling through this high-tech dissertation.
[00:29:11.857 --> 00:29:13.438]  There's hyperlinks to all of this.
[00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:30.372]  The results of your recently published test seem to clear things up to support your team's August 2003 update as a tale by the Associated Press in which you were ready to rule out weak steel as a contributing factor in the collapse.
[00:29:30.792 --> 00:29:34.976]  The evaluation of paint deformation and
[00:29:36.104 --> 00:29:40.389]  We'll continue when we get back with this, but basically they're saying it's impossible.
[00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:46.094]  3,000 degrees wouldn't do this, much less 2,000, and the jet fuel was burning at 1,600!
[00:29:48.317 --> 00:29:51.200]  It's never happened before, and it didn't happen on 9-11!
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.501]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.981 --> 00:29:54.603]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.524 --> 00:29:58.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.551 --> 00:30:03.332]  By now, you've heard about DirecTV.
[00:30:03.492 --> 00:30:11.434]  You've heard that with DirecTV, you get a better value than cable, a better selection than cable, and access to exclusive programming that you can't get anywhere else.
[00:30:11.634 --> 00:30:13.875]  But for whatever reason, you thought there was a catch.
[00:30:14.155 --> 00:30:15.716]  Maybe even hidden fees.
[00:30:15.936 --> 00:30:17.556]  Well, Expert Satellite can help.
[00:30:17.776 --> 00:30:19.897]  And we've done it for hundreds of thousands already.

[00:30:46.735 --> 00:30:49.597]  Plus, get a free DVD player while supplies last.
[00:30:49.717 --> 00:30:50.558]  Just dial 1-800-655-0658.
[00:30:50.578 --> 00:30:50.878]  That's 800-655-0658.
[00:30:50.898 --> 00:30:52.539]  Call now for complete details.
[00:30:58.404 --> 00:30:59.085]  Conditions apply.
[00:31:19.707 --> 00:31:20.067]  We're good to go!
[00:31:36.247 --> 00:31:36.748]  That's right.
[00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:44.054]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:44.334 --> 00:31:48.458]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:53.602]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.327 --> 00:32:10.492]  You love your pet, and when your dog or cat starts to suffer from the debilitating effects of arthritis, you want to do everything possible to bring back their energy and spirit.
[00:32:10.712 --> 00:32:18.016]  Now, both you and your pet can benefit from a revolutionary natural approach to overcoming arthritic problems induced by aging with Pet Wonder.
[00:32:18.176 --> 00:32:27.342]  Pet Wonder contains glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and shark cartilage, the three top natural ingredients for fighting arthritic problems, particularly inflammation and pain.
[00:32:27.602 --> 00:32:35.006]  Pet Wonder has no side effects, caused a fraction of many pharmaceutical or veterinarian procedures, and results are often seen in just a few days.
[00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:40.549]  Pet Wonder can help change the degeneration of your pet's health and rejuvenate both its health and happiness.
[00:32:40.749 --> 00:32:43.110]  Your pet will thank you for the added energy and spirit.
[00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:48.292]  Call 800-882-3213 for more information or to order Pet Wonder.
[00:32:48.473 --> 00:32:51.094]  It will turn your pet into the puppy or kitten it once was.
[00:32:51.394 --> 00:32:56.856]  Call 800-882-3213 today or visit the web at PetWonder.com.
[00:32:56.976 --> 00:32:58.617]  That's PetWonder.com.
[00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:09.400]  Alright, we're talking about Tower 1 and 2.
[00:33:09.441 --> 00:33:18.924]  The 210 story buildings that magically collapsed on 9-11 when they were designed to take multiple jumbo jet hits.
[00:33:22.193 --> 00:33:33.840]  However, the summary of the new NIST report seems to ignore your findings, as it suggests that these low temperatures caused exposed bits of the building's steel core to soften and buckle.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:45.727]  Additionally, the summary states that the perimeter columns softened, yet your findings make clear that most perimeter panels, 157 of 160, saw no temperature above 250 degrees Celsius to soften steel
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:57.042]  For the purposes of forging, normally, temperatures are needed to be more than 1,100 degrees Celsius.
[00:33:57.082 --> 00:34:06.926]  However, the new summary report suggests that much lower temperatures would be able to not only soften the steel in a matter of minutes, but lead to rapid structural collapse.
[00:34:07.426 --> 00:34:10.647]  The story doesn't just... the story does just not add up.
[00:34:11.548 --> 00:34:13.268]  Again, the story just does not add up.
[00:34:13.749 --> 00:34:19.911]  If steel from those buildings did soften or melt, I'm sure we can all agree that this was certainly not due to jet fuel
[00:34:20.709 --> 00:34:21.930]  And fires of any kind.
[00:34:22.351 --> 00:34:23.132]  Let me alone.
[00:34:23.152 --> 00:34:28.577]  It says, let alone the briefly burning fires in those towers.
[00:34:28.657 --> 00:34:32.501]  Again, people standing in the holes right where the main fires were.
[00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:34.143]  It wasn't even hot enough to burn them.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.742]  The fact should be of great concern to all Americans.
[00:34:37.863 --> 00:34:49.693]  Alternatively, the connection and the contention that steel did fail at temperatures around 250 degrees Celsius suggests the majority of deaths on 9-11 were due to a safety-related failure.
[00:34:50.073 --> 00:34:55.939]  The suggestion should be of great concern to my company, again, who certified the steel when they built it.
[00:34:56.279 --> 00:34:57.780]  There is no question that the events of 9-11
[00:34:59.737 --> 00:35:07.242]  are the emotional driving force behind the war on terror and the issue of the WTC collapse is at the crux of the story of 9-11.
[00:35:08.162 --> 00:35:09.603]  My feeling is is that your
[00:35:13.408 --> 00:35:17.432]  Multiregional tests are at the crux of the crux of the crux.
[00:35:17.893 --> 00:35:29.886]  Either you can make sense of what really happened to those buildings and communicate this quickly or we will all face the same destruction and despair that come from global decisions based on disinformation and shatter.
[00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:33.389]  Thanks for your efforts to determine what really happened on that day.
[00:35:33.809 --> 00:35:40.055]  You may know that there are a number of other current and former government employees that have risked a great deal to help us know the truth.
[00:35:40.496 --> 00:35:45.200]  I've copied one of those people on this message as a sign of respect and support.
[00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:53.068]  I believe your work could also be a nucleus of fact around which the truth and thereby global peace and justice can grow again.
[00:35:53.488 --> 00:36:01.691]  Please do what you can to quickly eliminate the confusion regarding the ability of jet fuel fires to soften and melt structural steel.
[00:36:03.592 --> 00:36:05.973]  Again, the fires weren't even at 2,000 degrees.
[00:36:05.993 --> 00:36:11.975]  2,000 degrees will not even melt non-hardened, non-structural raw steel.
[00:36:12.015 --> 00:36:12.755]  They state that.
[00:36:13.035 --> 00:36:15.176]  They have links to all the structural facts here.
[00:36:17.395 --> 00:36:24.637]  And that's Kevin Ryan, Site Manager, Environmental Health Laboratories, a division of Underwriters Laboratories that underwrote the World Trade Center.
[00:36:25.838 --> 00:36:27.779]  And they have links here in the bibliography.
[00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:40.063]  Boulder Weekly, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 61st edition, page D-1873, the WTCNIST.gov, and the WTC.NIST.gov,
[00:36:47.751 --> 00:36:53.236]  Forging.org, the big basic site for engineers on steel strengths.
[00:36:55.819 --> 00:37:02.345]  And again, I just spent ten minutes kind of ham-fistedly babbling through that, but you need to go read it for yourself, folks.
[00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:06.834]  People were standing in the holes in the two buildings.
[00:37:07.294 --> 00:37:17.042]  The firefighters said on their tapes that the fires were almost completely out and temperatures had dropped, even in the cores of the fires, to only 600 degrees.
[00:37:17.382 --> 00:37:21.445]  And in other areas it was only 150 degrees on the floors hit.
[00:37:21.845 --> 00:37:26.489]  The fires were almost completely out and the firefighters then called up more ladders.
[00:37:27.566 --> 00:37:29.106]  That is more teams of firefighters.
[00:37:29.407 --> 00:37:36.989]  The government did not want you to hear those audio tapes, so they declared national security on them and said that they were destroyed or malfunctioned.
[00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:45.451]  Then the firefighter union got mad and licked the tapes that were in the New York Daily News where the firefighters reported that the fires were basically out.
[00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:53.574]  There were firefighters and citizens standing in the holes where the planes went in.
[00:37:55.504 --> 00:37:56.844]  But forget all that.
[00:37:57.405 --> 00:38:00.585]  Building 7 was not hit by a jet.
[00:38:00.785 --> 00:38:02.706]  It's two blocks away.
[00:38:04.927 --> 00:38:07.447]  What, at 525 Eastern, 425 Central?
[00:38:08.127 --> 00:38:12.609]  That building, with two small fires on two floors, collapsed and floated on itself.
[00:38:13.089 --> 00:38:15.629]  The firefighters said, get back to AP reporters.
[00:38:15.689 --> 00:38:16.930]  We're going to bring the building down.
[00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:20.131]  Larry Silverstein says they brought the building down.
[00:38:20.411 --> 00:38:21.871]  The seismographs show it.
[00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:27.590]  This is an open secret.
[00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.011]  It's not debatable.
[00:38:29.271 --> 00:38:35.175]  It's not a conspiracy theory like NBC and CNN says it is last week attacking us and others.
[00:38:37.596 --> 00:38:47.482]  Now you realize how important it is to get the WTC7 section that's on PrisonPlanet.com and to email it out to everybody.
[00:38:49.303 --> 00:38:53.926]  And it's not posted on the main site today, so go to the little calendar there on PrisonPlanet.com
[00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:58.030]  And click back to Friday.
[00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.693]  And we've updated it.
[00:39:01.214 --> 00:39:02.736]  We've added a lot of links to it.
[00:39:03.838 --> 00:39:11.088]  And it's got a lot of new information, including this letter by the underwriters of the building.
[00:39:12.105 --> 00:39:17.788]  by the group that certified it for the underwriters when it was built saying it's impossible that's been added to it.
[00:39:18.248 --> 00:39:20.609]  So get it, email it out to everybody.
[00:39:20.709 --> 00:39:23.170]  It is so important to expose this.
[00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:24.851]  The power of you, the people.
[00:39:25.371 --> 00:39:33.975]  Getting the story, a huge data page with over 60 links and 20 video clips and emailing it out to everybody is unstoppable.
[00:39:35.598 --> 00:39:40.442]  You can also go to our news group on the left hand side of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:39:40.482 --> 00:39:41.283]  It says News Group.
[00:39:41.643 --> 00:39:49.851]  Click on that and then go to the news group mailing from Friday and it's also got the link to the structural underwriter.
[00:39:52.163 --> 00:39:53.224]  Saying it's impossible.
[00:39:53.604 --> 00:39:56.165]  The certifiers and the WTC section.
[00:39:56.425 --> 00:39:57.646]  You can find it there as well.
[00:39:58.366 --> 00:40:01.708]  Or simply go to searchinfowars.com.
[00:40:02.208 --> 00:40:05.089]  Or go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com themselves.
[00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:06.510]  And type it in the search engine.
[00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:08.471]  WTC section.
[00:40:09.231 --> 00:40:11.912]  And it's one of the first hyperlinks that pop up.
[00:40:11.952 --> 00:40:13.293]  I'm sorry it's not on the main page.
[00:40:13.413 --> 00:40:17.134]  I forgot to tell my webmasters this morning to post that on both the sites.
[00:40:17.174 --> 00:40:18.415]  But it will be later this afternoon.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.281]  I mean, how do you deal with this?
[00:40:22.341 --> 00:40:24.643]  I mean, it's like, this stuff's hidden in plain view.
[00:40:24.683 --> 00:40:39.034]  It's like Arnold Schwarzenegger saying, I admire Hitler, I want to be a dictator, I don't like black people, they're subhuman, I use steroids, I pose for gay magazines, and it's, oh, he's a conservative, let's ignore all that.
[00:40:39.074 --> 00:40:39.875]  It's hidden in plain view.
[00:40:39.955 --> 00:40:43.878]  It's like, Alberto, I love Torture Gonzales, to be the new Attorney General,
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:53.803]  This guy is the architect of the memos saying the president's above federal law, he's allowed to torture, the enemy combatant designation for U.S.
[00:40:53.863 --> 00:40:56.103]  citizens where he can be secretly arrested.
[00:40:56.123 --> 00:40:59.144]  Now that's hidden in plain view.
[00:40:59.204 --> 00:41:02.265]  He's pro-abortion, pro-open border, pro-gun control.
[00:41:02.325 --> 00:41:03.826]  He's being hailed by conservatives.
[00:41:04.426 --> 00:41:05.446]  You're not conservatives.
[00:41:05.826 --> 00:41:06.866]  It's hidden in plain view.
[00:41:07.827 --> 00:41:09.187]  It's like all of this stuff.
[00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:11.968]  It just gives me a headache.
[00:41:13.925 --> 00:41:22.037]  But again, non-hardened, non-structural steel will not even turn red hot until it hits 2,000 degrees.
[00:41:25.126 --> 00:41:26.887]  The fires got no hotter than 1600.
[00:41:27.207 --> 00:41:29.028]  That's what jet fuel burns at.
[00:41:29.288 --> 00:41:30.529]  Paper burns even lower.
[00:41:31.009 --> 00:41:32.050]  It was black smoke.
[00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.391]  That's indicative of 600 degree fires.
[00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:36.352]  Low burning fires.
[00:41:36.752 --> 00:41:38.993]  The firefighters said the fires were almost down.
[00:41:39.314 --> 00:41:40.354]  Call up more teams.
[00:41:40.634 --> 00:41:43.736]  We can save the other floors from damage.
[00:41:44.972 --> 00:41:53.455]  Forget collapse, but building 7 isn't hit by a plane, and then they slip up on TV and say they blew it up, and we're supposed to ignore it!
[00:41:53.815 --> 00:42:05.979]  If I was the owner of a 47-story building, and it mysteriously collapsed, not hit by a plane, and then I went on TV and said, I blew it up, don't you think I'd be arrested within hours?
[00:42:07.359 --> 00:42:08.760]  But we just ignore it!
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:12.201]  It's like we ignore Arnold saying he admires Hitler!
[00:42:13.058 --> 00:42:16.620]  That he wants to be worshipped like Hitler at a Nuremberg-style rally!
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:17.800]  We ignore it!
[00:42:19.641 --> 00:42:27.624]  Just like in Texas we ignore two-thirds of the foster children on psychotropic drugs, many of them on 17 different drugs.
[00:42:29.165 --> 00:42:33.427]  Just like we ignore all this in plain view, just basic insanity.
[00:42:35.508 --> 00:42:38.289]  Just like we ignore the thousands of prestigious
[00:42:40.133 --> 00:42:44.195]  Reports about what sodium fluoride does to your brain and your bones.
[00:42:44.775 --> 00:42:48.056]  It's like we ignore what mercury does in the vaccines to our children.
[00:42:48.236 --> 00:42:53.798]  And then the feds come out and say, not only is mercury not bad, it's actually good for you!
[00:42:53.818 --> 00:43:00.199]  I mean, I'm not a radical, folks!
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:08.202]  I mean, if I was teleported back a thousand years ago to Aztec Kingdom of Chichen Itza,
[00:43:09.099 --> 00:43:12.001]  And they were cutting people's hearts out and I said, don't do that, it's bad.
[00:43:12.041 --> 00:43:13.141]  Yes, I would be crazy.
[00:43:13.542 --> 00:43:14.262]  I would be radical.
[00:43:14.362 --> 00:43:18.024]  I would be bad because the morals of that society were so degenerate.
[00:43:18.485 --> 00:43:23.828]  It's like if I was teleported back to 1938 Germany and said Hitler was bad, I'd be seen as a space alien.
[00:43:25.402 --> 00:43:27.983]  Have we slipped this far that I'm a radical?
[00:43:28.263 --> 00:43:31.904]  Because I say two-thirds of foster children on psychotropic drugs is a problem?
[00:43:32.164 --> 00:43:35.425]  Because I say Arnold saying he admires Hitler is a problem?
[00:43:35.745 --> 00:43:41.186]  Because I say that what all engineers say, that you can go test for yourself, they've done the test?
[00:43:41.646 --> 00:43:44.327]  Steel just turns red hot at 2,000 degrees!
[00:43:44.667 --> 00:43:45.987]  It doesn't melt till 3,000 degrees!
[00:43:46.007 --> 00:43:46.287]  Give that!
[00:43:52.495 --> 00:44:00.322]  You've got to take superheated air and gas and blast it into huge furnaces to get it liquefied at 4,000 plus degrees!
[00:44:02.745 --> 00:44:04.086]  It's common sense!
[00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:08.930]  It's all common sense!
[00:44:11.573 --> 00:44:18.359]  But you've got to face the horror of what the New World Order is and what it's up to if you want to change it, if you want to stop it.
[00:44:21.886 --> 00:44:25.848]  Oh, I know where you can find a direct link on the main page to the WTC7 section.
[00:44:26.269 --> 00:44:29.931]  At reopen911.com, or is it .org?
[00:44:30.271 --> 00:44:31.352]  Jimmy Walter's site.
[00:44:31.572 --> 00:44:33.032]  Reopen911.com.
[00:44:34.914 --> 00:44:35.674]  Or is it .org?
[00:44:36.174 --> 00:44:37.375]  It's right there on the main page.
[00:44:37.415 --> 00:44:38.035]  They link to it.
[00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:39.836]  So that's where you can find it.
[00:44:42.538 --> 00:44:43.819]  We appreciate them linking to us.
[00:44:47.381 --> 00:44:51.143]  I mean, it really is just starting to blow me away.
[00:44:56.429 --> 00:44:57.210]  It's unspeakable.
[00:44:57.810 --> 00:44:58.590]  It's unspeakable.
[00:44:59.371 --> 00:44:59.911]  What's happening?
[00:44:59.951 --> 00:45:21.504]  Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post has an article, 9-1-1 terror used to sell cigarettes in Israeli papers, and they talk to the ad agency in Israel, and they make a joke about 9-11, and they sell cigarettes off a thing of saying, you know, buy our Dutch cigarettes, don't buy American cigarettes, they blow Americans away, and it shows the two towers blowing up, and they think it's real funny.
[00:45:22.495 --> 00:45:25.236]  Think of an American company did this, or an Arab company.
[00:45:25.796 --> 00:45:27.136]  But Israel's allowed to.
[00:45:27.616 --> 00:45:28.877]  Again, I'm not bashing Israel.
[00:45:29.337 --> 00:45:31.637]  It's the Jerusalem Post saying it's wrong.
[00:45:32.078 --> 00:45:41.120]  I'll probably be arrested and shipped to the EU for trial as being anti-Israel for saying that this is wrong what they're doing, but so be it.
[00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:44.981]  Oh, man.
[00:45:48.182 --> 00:45:48.642]  What do you do?
[00:45:50.934 --> 00:45:52.535]  By the way, we've got this clip.
[00:45:53.056 --> 00:45:56.879]  This local group is running, promoting Arnold for president.
[00:45:58.581 --> 00:46:03.445]  And again, it's one of his campaign heads, the head of finance for him, openly doing this.
[00:46:03.485 --> 00:46:12.112]  He's got all his minions out pushing it, including Rohrabacher, and Hatch, and Kennedy, and it's just disgusting.
[00:46:12.563 --> 00:46:15.184]  We'll be playing that little 30-second ad after we take some calls.
[00:46:15.944 --> 00:46:18.905]  Also, John, will you go to my WTC7 section?
[00:46:19.205 --> 00:46:29.869]  We've added a new clip from PBS four years ago with the designer of the WTC saying that it was designed to take multiple large passenger jet hits.
[00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:35.151]  By the way, a clip we've never aired is Peter Jennings talking about how it looks like explosives.
[00:46:39.092 --> 00:46:40.072]  We ought to air that, too.
[00:46:40.112 --> 00:46:41.193]  That's at the bottom of the page.
[00:46:42.648 --> 00:46:45.690]  Literally, folks, I'm getting a headache right now even talking about all of this.
[00:46:47.551 --> 00:46:49.752]  Every day I have to watch the serial killers.
[00:46:49.792 --> 00:46:51.994]  I have to watch the perpetrators of mass murder.
[00:46:52.254 --> 00:46:55.256]  I have to watch the people that put cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[00:46:55.516 --> 00:46:57.917]  I have to watch the people that put sodium chloride in your water.
[00:46:58.177 --> 00:47:00.899]  I have to watch the people that put mercury in your vaccines.
[00:47:01.119 --> 00:47:03.261]  I have to watch the people getting rid of our borders.
[00:47:03.601 --> 00:47:05.722]  The people that are destroying our country.
[00:47:05.902 --> 00:47:19.565]  The people that created Saddam, and Bin Laden, and Noriega, and everybody else, I have to watch the globalists sit up there as your saviors, sit up there and dismantle this country, sit up there and turn us into a police state, and tell us what a favor they're doing for us!
[00:47:19.985 --> 00:47:20.926]  I'm sick of it!
[00:47:25.467 --> 00:47:35.269]  Cops, imagine, knowing somebody's a killer, you got all the evidence, you dug the bodies up out of their backyard, you show people that the skeletons,
[00:47:37.169 --> 00:47:42.192]  You catch the killer, you know, in his house with a safe full of videos of him killing the people.
[00:47:42.972 --> 00:47:43.973]  And you show everybody.
[00:47:45.334 --> 00:47:47.775]  And then they say, ah, shut up, conspiracy theorist.
[00:47:48.195 --> 00:47:51.537]  Let's make the person you call a serial killer our president.
[00:47:53.798 --> 00:47:54.638]  That's my life.
[00:47:55.139 --> 00:47:57.340]  That's what I have to watch and just look at.
[00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.412]  And so maybe you got a good defense mechanism out there.
[00:48:01.432 --> 00:48:02.793]  Maybe you don't want to face this honor.
[00:48:03.073 --> 00:48:04.274]  Maybe you don't want to know the truth.
[00:48:04.634 --> 00:48:06.415]  So just go ahead and deny what I'm saying.
[00:48:06.635 --> 00:48:07.716]  Just deny it all.
[00:48:07.756 --> 00:48:08.317]  Just love it.
[00:48:08.357 --> 00:48:09.217]  Just go along with it.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:13.300]  Take a deep breath.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:13.901]  Oh man.
[00:48:16.002 --> 00:48:16.102]  Oh.
[00:48:18.404 --> 00:48:21.766]  I got articles here with Fort Bragg trying to take over our cities.
[00:48:22.807 --> 00:48:23.548]  I got articles.
[00:48:23.648 --> 00:48:24.448]  I just got it all.
[00:48:24.608 --> 00:48:25.089]  It's just sick.
[00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:31.050]  Alright, I've been doing a better job lately of going to calls earlier, but not today.
[00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:32.331]  But we'll start going to your calls now.
[00:48:33.912 --> 00:48:35.894]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ed in California.
[00:48:35.954 --> 00:48:36.554]  Ed, go ahead.
[00:48:37.615 --> 00:48:38.316]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:48:38.756 --> 00:48:39.057]  Yes.
[00:48:39.717 --> 00:48:43.480]  I got this article right here from Howard Ruff, saying that U.S.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.283]  Presbyterians are warned to change anti-Israel stance.
[00:48:46.383 --> 00:48:53.169]  They're basically getting threatening phone calls in the middle of the night, supposedly because they have an anti-Israel policy.
[00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:59.249]  They're getting these phone calls, hate mail, telling them to change their policy around.
[00:49:00.009 --> 00:49:01.230]  A lot of churches will get burned.
[00:49:03.332 --> 00:49:06.955]  Well, you know, I'm surprised that's even getting any press attention.
[00:49:07.135 --> 00:49:11.519]  There's a lot of terrorism that goes on on the Israeli side.
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:16.444]  A lot of terrorism against Jews in Israel that are against the policies of Israel.
[00:49:17.024 --> 00:49:18.726]  I also wanted to bring up something else.
[00:49:20.507 --> 00:49:21.228]  I know, now,
[00:49:22.252 --> 00:49:26.375]  You promote a lot of these third parties, and I'm a member of one of them.
[00:49:27.156 --> 00:49:33.240]  I think I've called your people and I've told them about what's going on.
[00:49:33.641 --> 00:49:46.390]  Well anyway, one of the leaders of these third parties, a pretty Gladstonian liberal battle party, well basically one of their heads is a member of Bohemian Grove.
[00:49:49.074 --> 00:49:51.935]  You're talking about the Libertarian Party?
[00:49:52.295 --> 00:49:52.636]  That's right.
[00:49:53.276 --> 00:49:54.516]  Yeah, I got your email on that.
[00:49:54.536 --> 00:49:56.217]  I didn't have time to track it down and confirm it.
[00:49:56.237 --> 00:49:58.058]  That's how busy I am, but I didn't read your email.
[00:49:58.778 --> 00:50:00.359]  Who is it you're saying is a member of the Grove?
[00:50:00.959 --> 00:50:04.360]  The Executive Director of California Libertarian Party.
[00:50:06.201 --> 00:50:07.242]  And what's his name?
[00:50:08.122 --> 00:50:08.882]  David Rupprecht.
[00:50:09.663 --> 00:50:11.123]  And where'd you find that about David?
[00:50:11.623 --> 00:50:12.204]  I spoke to him.
[00:50:14.064 --> 00:50:15.765]  Oh, and he said, I'm a member of Bohemian Grove.
[00:50:15.985 --> 00:50:17.306]  Yeah, he said he's been in it for 18 years.
[00:50:19.222 --> 00:50:21.144]  He knows James Baker.
[00:50:21.164 --> 00:50:22.946]  He knows a lot of people.
[00:50:22.966 --> 00:50:24.067]  He knows Kissinger.
[00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:26.489]  George Bush Jr.
[00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:28.811]  is not a member of it, but George Bush Sr.
[00:50:28.951 --> 00:50:29.031]  is.
[00:50:29.312 --> 00:50:30.252]  Okay, that's not true.
[00:50:30.272 --> 00:50:35.998]  I have the annals of the Bohemian Grove with him and his father, and it says they're members, giving a speech below the owl.
[00:50:36.838 --> 00:50:40.342]  I have the official hardbound book, the 1986-1996 decade annual.
[00:50:40.362 --> 00:50:41.162]  I know you're right.
[00:50:41.202 --> 00:50:41.423]  I know.
[00:50:47.324 --> 00:50:50.246]  Of course they're busy infiltrating every different organization.
[00:50:52.266 --> 00:50:52.907]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:52.947 --> 00:50:53.667]  Interesting points.
[00:50:54.848 --> 00:50:56.108]  John and others, you're up next.
[00:50:56.148 --> 00:50:58.349]  When we get back, a lot more news.
[00:50:58.429 --> 00:51:00.130]  I haven't even gotten into the beginnings of it.
[00:51:01.323 --> 00:51:05.689]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.849 --> 00:51:10.275]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.416 --> 00:51:14.801]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.842 --> 00:51:16.203]  The New World Order.
[00:51:16.984 --> 00:51:17.945]  Panama!
[00:51:17.965 --> 00:51:18.745]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:46.664 --> 00:51:48.526]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:51:48.566 --> 00:51:56.892]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:13.906 --> 00:52:18.448]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the black Berkey purification element.
[00:52:18.508 --> 00:52:29.833]  When used, water flow through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:30.433 --> 00:52:37.276]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:37.676 --> 00:52:39.817]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:52:40.297 --> 00:52:45.279]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:52.862]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438, and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:52.902 --> 00:52:53.542]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:00.245 --> 00:53:00.525]  I think?
[00:53:17.779 --> 00:53:18.439]  We're good to go!
[00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.492]  Simply log on to HerbalHealer.com.
[00:53:42.652 --> 00:53:47.075]  Check out our online member testimonials and our hundreds of exceptional products.
[00:53:47.315 --> 00:53:50.397]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.557 --> 00:53:56.421]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:11.228 --> 00:54:22.395]  Coming up the next hour, we'll play Frank A. DiMartini, manager of the World Trade Center Construction and engineer himself, saying that the buildings are designed to take multiple hits from large jets.
[00:54:24.377 --> 00:54:28.359]  And then we'll also play that Peter Jennings where they talk about how it looks like explosives.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.441]  We'll play Dan Rather again.
[00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:33.923]  We'll play Larry Silverstein again saying they blew it up.
[00:54:34.803 --> 00:54:37.445]  We'll play it all again and then read back over some of the key quotes.
[00:54:39.017 --> 00:54:52.825]  uh... by Kevin Ryan of the Underwriters Laboratories to the National Institute of Standards and Technology and they're the company that certified the steel components used in the construction of the World Trade Center towers.
[00:54:53.125 --> 00:54:59.548]  They've now done their own test with jet fuel that doesn't even heat up steel to a red-hot level.
[00:55:00.289 --> 00:55:06.552]  No matter how long they baste it, no matter how long they burn it, it will sit there forever in the flames.
[00:55:08.731 --> 00:55:10.372]  And that's non-hardened steel.
[00:55:10.452 --> 00:55:16.193]  It's even worse if it's hardened construction steel, which they use in the WTC complex.
[00:55:17.613 --> 00:55:19.854]  So, that's all coming up, of course, your calls.
[00:55:20.514 --> 00:55:28.896]  More on Arnold officially going for President with his minions pushing it, repeal the second article of the Constitution and the 22nd Amendment.
[00:55:29.798 --> 00:55:35.680]  We've got detailed articles on that on both the websites, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, so much other news.
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:41.662]  In Miami, there's just been a mad frenzy of tasering six-year-olds, twelve-year-olds.
[00:55:42.302 --> 00:55:44.783]  If somebody talks back to the cops, they taser them now.
[00:55:46.463 --> 00:55:50.765]  Just the attack on the citizenry, you know, their bloodlust to attack us is really becoming evident.
[00:55:52.325 --> 00:55:53.326]  That's all coming up.
[00:55:54.750 --> 00:56:01.176]  Preemptive plans to attack Syria, Iran, North Korea are now public.
[00:56:01.236 --> 00:56:03.518]  Secretary of State Powell has resigned.
[00:56:04.158 --> 00:56:05.799]  It's all wall-to-wall news.
[00:56:05.819 --> 00:56:11.264]  We'll go to John and Jack and Hank and Dan and others here in a few minutes.
[00:56:12.045 --> 00:56:14.327]  Before I go back to your calls and the news,
[00:56:16.107 --> 00:56:17.328]  I've made 11 films.
[00:56:17.368 --> 00:56:27.278]  The 11th film is American Dictators, documenting the staged election in 2004, showing how Bush and Carrier cousins, skull and bones, how their policies are identical, how the election was staged.
[00:56:27.318 --> 00:56:32.102]  It's so important to get this to people now, so they understand how both parties are controlled.
[00:56:33.003 --> 00:56:35.606]  It's a great film on DVD and VHS, 1995.
[00:56:37.467 --> 00:56:41.011]  When you get one copy, each additional copy, only on DVD, we do this offer,
[00:56:42.024 --> 00:56:44.446]  595.
[00:56:42.805 --> 00:56:44.446]  So get 5, 6, 7, 8 copies.
[00:56:44.906 --> 00:56:46.707]  Give them out to friends and family as gifts.
[00:56:46.867 --> 00:56:47.327]  Wake them up.
[00:56:47.767 --> 00:56:49.428]  Same thing with 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:56:49.508 --> 00:56:51.009]  Almost three hours long.
[00:56:51.049 --> 00:56:52.630]  Just a few minutes short of three hours long.
[00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:56.953]  The tour de force of government-sponsored terror and 9-11 exposing it.
[00:56:57.733 --> 00:57:00.134]  Still the preeminent film, many experts agree.
[00:57:00.995 --> 00:57:04.957]  It is $24.95 for one DVD or VHS.
[00:57:05.457 --> 00:57:07.018]  The traditional DVD is $5.95.
[00:57:11.286 --> 00:57:12.287]  So get ten copies.
[00:57:12.327 --> 00:57:13.087]  Get two copies.
[00:57:13.368 --> 00:57:14.208]  Get five copies.
[00:57:14.729 --> 00:57:15.749]  Get it out to people.
[00:57:15.809 --> 00:57:17.931]  Or get the originals and just make copies yourself.
[00:57:18.031 --> 00:57:24.276]  People like a nice pretty and shrink-wrapped color cover with a stamp on the top of the DVD and a nice color image.
[00:57:24.556 --> 00:57:29.560]  They tend to watch it more often and then when somebody watches it, 90% of the time we get a wake-up.
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:31.381]  So it's up to you folks.
[00:57:31.421 --> 00:57:32.161]  Balls in your court.
[00:57:32.201 --> 00:57:36.545]  I've got my 9-11 Insight Job Special where you can get
[00:57:37.802 --> 00:57:47.525]  Four 9-11-11 videos, my two videos, George Humphrey's video, Eric Huffman's video, and Paul Watson's book, a fifth item, 300 pages, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:57:49.306 --> 00:57:52.107]  Five items, four videos and a book for $59.95.
[00:57:52.627 --> 00:57:54.668]  That is a $53 discount.
[00:57:55.048 --> 00:57:58.509]  Even if you already own some of those, take advantage of that and give them as gifts.
[00:57:59.716 --> 00:58:01.117]  Here's the toll-free number to order.
[00:58:01.137 --> 00:58:03.198]  You can ask about the specials when you call.

[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:06.760]  Don't wait.
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:06.840]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:15.845 --> 00:58:16.805]  253-3139.
[00:58:19.266 --> 00:58:21.607]  Help us expose the New World Order serial killers.
[00:58:21.988 --> 00:58:22.988]  Help bring them to justice.
[00:58:23.008 --> 00:58:29.191]  You can also order via the secure, safe online shopping cart at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:29.231 --> 00:58:33.372]  You can watch all the films online in high-res or low-res.
[00:58:33.873 --> 00:58:34.673]  All 11 films.
[00:58:34.753 --> 00:58:40.456]  My book, Paul Watson's book, weekly TV reports, 15 cents a day, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:41.996 --> 00:58:42.877]  Such a great deal.
[00:58:42.897 --> 00:58:45.980]  QuizzenPlanet.tv, also give a membership as a gift.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.581]  We'll be right back with a second hour.
[00:58:47.601 --> 00:58:48.001]  Stay with us.
[00:58:48.562 --> 00:58:48.882]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.025 --> 00:59:00.065]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.786 --> 00:59:01.886]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.546 --> 00:59:03.387]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:05.007]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.027 --> 00:59:09.369]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.869 --> 00:59:14.011]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.411 --> 00:59:19.053]  Alright, you do not want to miss this second hour.
[00:59:19.153 --> 00:59:21.294]  It is Monday, the 15th day of November 2004.
[00:59:21.794 --> 00:59:23.635]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.695 --> 00:59:24.635]  I'm not left or right.
[00:59:25.635 --> 00:59:26.735]  I'm about right and wrong.
[00:59:26.795 --> 00:59:27.556]  I love freedom.
[00:59:27.616 --> 00:59:28.636]  I love our country.
[00:59:29.196 --> 00:59:30.877]  Our freedoms are being dismantled.
[00:59:30.977 --> 00:59:36.598]  America's being brought into the Pan-American Union via the free trade area of the Americas.
[00:59:38.499 --> 00:59:46.421]  They're openly now pushing to repeal parts of the Bill of Rights and Constitution so Arnold Schwarzenegger can be president.
[00:59:47.726 --> 00:59:56.132]  We've got more on Colin Powell resigning, more on our new Attorney General to be Alberto, I love torture, Gonzalez, more on him.
[00:59:57.554 --> 01:00:02.617]  The group that underwrote the steel for the WTC, the scientists are saying this is totally fake.
[01:00:03.638 --> 01:00:08.021]  Even non-treated raw steel doesn't even heat up at 2,000 degrees.
[01:00:09.663 --> 01:00:10.863]  They say it's impossible.
[01:00:10.883 --> 01:00:13.245]  We'll get into that more.
[01:00:13.265 --> 01:00:15.487]  We've got a bunch of audio clips coming up on that.
[01:00:15.627 --> 01:00:16.748]  Loaded phone lines.
[01:00:17.412 --> 01:00:19.813]  There's so much news in this second hour.
[01:00:20.273 --> 01:00:22.594]  Right now, let's go to John in Louisiana.
[01:00:22.654 --> 01:00:23.514]  John, you're on the air.
[01:00:23.534 --> 01:00:24.114]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:24.334 --> 01:00:24.714]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:24.734 --> 01:00:25.494]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:00:25.674 --> 01:00:30.276]  Alex, there's a small feature about structural steel in high-rise buildings.
[01:00:30.536 --> 01:00:42.579]  All buildings built in the last 60 to 70 years of three stories and higher have all vital structural steel members encased in insulation, sprayed on installation.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.220]  In the old days, it was
[01:00:44.659 --> 01:00:45.860]  Yeah, that's what all the WTC buildings had.
[01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:05.573]  That and could not damage those steel members because they are protected.
[01:01:05.613 --> 01:01:06.473]  But it's not just that.
[01:01:06.673 --> 01:01:12.378]  Raw steel, not even construction grade, doesn't even turn red at 2,000 degrees.
[01:01:12.558 --> 01:01:17.241]  It's all patently absurd, but they've got us so brainwashed we can't handle it.
[01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:28.750]  Well, I mean, here is the scientific group that underwrote it, the scientific firm that went and did the study of the steel when it was built, certified as the highest grade steel,
[01:01:30.202 --> 01:01:39.129]  But they put raw steel for days in rooms with blasted, heated jet fuel being sprayed on it, and it didn't even melt it.
[01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:40.589]  It's impossible!
[01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:45.433]  Look, let's talk about the frenzied attack on the Constitution.
[01:01:45.473 --> 01:01:45.713]  Hold on.
[01:01:45.773 --> 01:01:46.754]  Let me just add this.
[01:01:46.854 --> 01:01:52.838]  It's the equivalent of me saying, you know, I can get a running start and run through 45 feet of concrete.
[01:01:53.578 --> 01:01:54.699]  It's patently absurd.
[01:01:54.839 --> 01:01:55.620]  It's impossible.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:55.980]  Go ahead.
[01:01:56.471 --> 01:02:07.097]  Yeah, this frenzied attack on the Constitution, this unseemly incredible speed of the creatures in Congress in jumping through this hoop, Schwarzenegger.
[01:02:07.197 --> 01:02:14.561]  Incidentally, his name translates, Schwarz is black, and N-E-G-E-R in the German language translates as Negro.
[01:02:15.002 --> 01:02:18.924]  And certainly he must be a part of the black ops operation.
[01:02:19.544 --> 01:02:20.425]  But it's
[01:02:21.212 --> 01:02:22.873]  Well, yeah, it's the same thing in Spanish.
[01:02:22.913 --> 01:02:25.054]  You know, it's like that good Mexican beer that's real dark.
[01:02:25.114 --> 01:02:26.195]  It's called Negro.
[01:02:26.755 --> 01:02:30.117]  And no, he claims it's Black Plowman, but I've talked to Germans.
[01:02:30.437 --> 01:02:33.398]  The name means darkness of the darkness.
[01:02:33.718 --> 01:02:34.899]  A fitting name for him.
[01:02:35.079 --> 01:02:36.420]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.601]  And they're pulling that on us as a matter of degradation.
[01:02:41.862 --> 01:02:46.385]  It's all done very deliberately to downgrade us and humiliate us, as you mentioned.
[01:02:47.185 --> 01:02:50.787]  But what I want you to do in a future program is to discuss
[01:02:51.777 --> 01:02:55.301]  What exactly happened on March 9, 1933?
[01:02:56.502 --> 01:03:01.146]  If we don't understand that, we don't understand anything about our government or what's happening.
[01:03:01.666 --> 01:03:03.929]  Tell folks about March 9th.
[01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:09.534]  Congress abdicated all authority and responsibility on March 9th.
[01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:14.092]  1933 in an illegal unconstitutional act.
[01:03:14.552 --> 01:03:19.754]  And I've got the actual copy from the Library of Congress giving martial law powers to Roosevelt.
[01:03:20.174 --> 01:03:26.617]  Absolutely, and there's never been a published work, a published book exposing this except for Dr. Schroeder's work.
[01:03:27.177 --> 01:03:29.098]  It's all available free on the net.
[01:03:29.378 --> 01:03:31.919]  If you'll just punch in War and Emergency Powers,
[01:03:32.358 --> 01:03:33.438]  We'll be right back!
[01:03:55.589 --> 01:04:01.054]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.495 --> 01:04:05.739]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:04:05.959 --> 01:04:13.006]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.386 --> 01:04:19.492]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.632 --> 01:04:20.853]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.173 --> 01:04:24.117]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:25.178]  Eliminate the cost.
[01:04:25.258 --> 01:04:26.299]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:33.848]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:04:34.149 --> 01:04:37.533]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:04:37.953 --> 01:04:41.097]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:04:41.117 --> 01:04:41.217]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.237 --> 01:04:41.337]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.457 --> 01:04:42.398]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:04:42.418 --> 01:04:42.618]  Call today.
[01:04:53.146 --> 01:04:53.947]  Terrorism.
[01:04:54.067 --> 01:04:54.827]  Terrorism.
[01:04:54.927 --> 01:04:55.768]  Chemical attacks.
[01:04:55.828 --> 01:04:56.508]  Dirty bombs.
[01:04:56.588 --> 01:04:57.008]  Fallout.
[01:04:57.088 --> 01:04:58.069]  Biological attack.
[01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.809]  Anthrax.
[01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:00.991]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:05:01.251 --> 01:05:02.852]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:05:03.092 --> 01:05:05.574]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.954 --> 01:05:20.523]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.563 --> 01:05:20.883]  government.
[01:05:21.063 --> 01:05:22.864]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:23.224 --> 01:05:29.147]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:29.267 --> 01:05:33.770]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:39.432]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:39.532 --> 01:05:40.753]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.813 --> 01:05:41.173]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.393 --> 01:05:43.434]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:52.378 --> 01:05:53.899]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:57.161]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:05:57.301 --> 01:06:01.203]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:06:01.243 --> 01:06:05.485]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:06:05.826 --> 01:06:09.608]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:06:09.748 --> 01:06:11.529]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:06:12.149 --> 01:06:15.052]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:06:15.092 --> 01:06:19.797]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:06:19.957 --> 01:06:23.000]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:26.043]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:06:26.544 --> 01:06:32.670]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:36.993]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:06:37.373 --> 01:06:38.754]  Order your video today.
[01:06:39.135 --> 01:06:41.736]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[01:06:41.816 --> 01:06:47.280]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:06:48.001 --> 01:06:51.363]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:06:53.365 --> 01:06:58.929]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.555 --> 01:07:08.536]  All right, my friends.
[01:07:08.696 --> 01:07:09.937]  We're back live.
[01:07:09.957 --> 01:07:11.419]  We're taking your phone calls.
[01:07:11.439 --> 01:07:15.622]  We're going to be getting into the WTC7 collapse with some of the new revelations later.
[01:07:16.643 --> 01:07:20.927]  Let me, for everybody out there, give you the actual web address.
[01:07:21.628 --> 01:07:22.088]  Listen up.
[01:07:22.729 --> 01:07:28.114]  Here is the actual web address to go to my WTC7 section itself.
[01:07:29.615 --> 01:07:30.035]  It is www.
[01:07:34.588 --> 01:07:44.330]  Again, if you type this in, you can get the data page with dozens of video clips
[01:08:03.531 --> 01:08:08.254]  Uh, dozens and dozens of, of, of length, engineers, scientists, eyewitnesses.
[01:08:08.594 --> 01:08:10.575]  Larry Silverstein saying he blew it up.
[01:08:11.356 --> 01:08:14.878]  Here is the address from PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:15.378 --> 01:08:18.580]  www.PrisonPlanet.com
[01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:36.577]  forward slash 011904 WTC and then the number 7.html.
[01:08:37.258 --> 01:08:39.279]  In fact, let's just do it again.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:46.444]  www.prisonplanet.com forward slash 011904 WTC7.html.
[01:08:46.744 --> 01:08:52.228]  Now I never do that, but just in case you can't find it,
[01:08:54.887 --> 01:09:12.915]  That's the page that has had added to it the company and the federal government who both certified the steel to over 3,000 degrees before it starts to have structural failure of any type.
[01:09:14.636 --> 01:09:17.417]  If you go to that page, one of the new things that's been added
[01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:23.924]  Is WTC Construction Manager saying the two towers were designed to take numerous large plane crashes.
[01:09:23.964 --> 01:09:31.510]  Under that, WTC Construction Certifiers say towers should have easily withstood jet fuel temperatures.
[01:09:32.911 --> 01:09:40.837]  Then under that, we have a 35 minute report I did almost a year ago on this where I play all the video clips and analyze it from my TV show.
[01:09:41.337 --> 01:09:46.201]  Then under that, I have Larry Silverstein saying they made the decision to pull it and bring it down.
[01:09:47.302 --> 01:09:48.023]  Then under that,
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:55.744]  I have, from the same PBS documentary, the head of the New York Engineering Group saying that pull it means demolish.
[01:09:56.584 --> 01:10:00.506]  Then under that I have Dan Rather, the video, saying that it looks like bombs.
[01:10:02.227 --> 01:10:09.792]  Then under that I have another clip with Peter Jennings saying the same thing.
[01:10:11.673 --> 01:10:13.113]  And it goes on and on.
[01:10:13.314 --> 01:10:14.834]  Everybody needs to get educated.
[01:10:14.854 --> 01:10:16.355]  You need to go read this 18 pages
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.842]  And read the hyperlinks and watch the video clips that are on the site.
[01:10:23.123 --> 01:10:24.703]  It's time we learn the truth.
[01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:26.764]  It's time we know the truth.
[01:10:26.965 --> 01:10:30.106]  It is impossible what they're saying and what they're doing.
[01:10:30.446 --> 01:10:31.967]  Later we'll play these audio clips.
[01:10:32.267 --> 01:10:34.648]  One more time, here is the web address.
[01:10:35.629 --> 01:10:41.572]  www.prisonplanet.com forward slash 011 904 WTC7.
[01:10:41.732 --> 01:10:43.853]  And again I said 0, it's 0.
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.941]  Let's go to Jack in Florida.
[01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:52.862]  Jack, thanks for holding.
[01:10:52.902 --> 01:10:53.222]  Welcome.
[01:10:56.504 --> 01:10:57.485]  Jack, you're on the air.
[01:10:58.245 --> 01:10:59.186]  Yes, hello Alex.
[01:10:59.266 --> 01:10:59.606]  Hello.
[01:11:00.827 --> 01:11:07.251]  You asked the key question a while ago that's got to be answered and acted on, or all of this information is useless.
[01:11:07.271 --> 01:11:09.012]  The question was, what do we do?
[01:11:11.313 --> 01:11:17.457]  There's got to be some type of legitimate forum that can hold these people accountable, presented
[01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:28.078]  Elliot Spitzer, the New York Attorney General.
[01:11:28.138 --> 01:11:31.139]  Well, number one, solutions are all multifaceted and multivariate.
[01:11:31.179 --> 01:11:31.900]  It's a great question.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.042]  Elliot Spitzer, everybody thinks he's so great because he goes after a few corrupt people.
[01:11:36.062 --> 01:11:37.823]  I think he's a poser.
[01:11:38.641 --> 01:11:49.450]  Has had open requests from victims, families, and others to open a criminal investigation into how the Towers fell, into insider trading, into government involvement.
[01:11:50.151 --> 01:11:51.011]  He's being pressured.
[01:11:51.352 --> 01:11:54.514]  He's agreed to look at reopening and he's looking at it right now.
[01:11:56.136 --> 01:12:03.782]  Any state or federal grand jury could open investigations on this and has the power to subpoena these people.
[01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:09.673]  Also, number one solution, what did Paul Revere do?
[01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:13.476]  He went around warning people about the invasion, about the takeover.
[01:12:14.017 --> 01:12:17.619]  All of us have to warn the general public that's still not informed.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:22.443]  Until something is set up to where this could be presented into evidence.
[01:12:23.487 --> 01:12:27.029]  If everybody on the planet knows all this information, it's going to be useless.
[01:12:27.449 --> 01:12:28.810]  Well, that's not really true.
[01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:41.016]  I mean, if everybody knows the truth, and everybody talks about it, and we start putting yard signs in our front yards about it, and if we all start getting involved and having marches, marches every month, which has already started around the country.
[01:12:41.036 --> 01:12:42.157]  There's two solutions.
[01:12:42.237 --> 01:12:48.980]  I mean, we've got to come up with the, what do we do, the best solution, and start acting upon that.
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:52.462]  That we start supporting this person you're talking about in New York.
[01:12:53.405 --> 01:12:55.766]  On getting this court case established?
[01:12:56.366 --> 01:12:58.107]  Well, you don't support Elliot Spitzer.
[01:12:58.147 --> 01:12:59.908]  You support him doing an investigation.
[01:13:00.468 --> 01:13:05.430]  You call and you write, especially if you're in New York, and you go, I demand you do something!
[01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:09.271]  The certifiers of the building say it is impossible!
[01:13:09.631 --> 01:13:11.372]  Okay, there is another solution.
[01:13:11.832 --> 01:13:17.014]  What is the best solution that all of us can work toward on getting this established?
[01:13:18.275 --> 01:13:20.075]  These people are going to have to be held accountable.
[01:13:20.135 --> 01:13:21.956]  Well, there's no magic silver bullet.
[01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:26.791]  It's a multi-faceted thing.
[01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:28.891]  Back to the question again.
[01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:29.572]  What do we do?
[01:13:30.252 --> 01:13:32.993]  Come up with the best solution and start acting on it.
[01:13:33.493 --> 01:13:33.793]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:33.813 --> 01:13:34.853]  I think it's a great question.
[01:13:34.933 --> 01:13:39.315]  And by the way, I don't have all the ideas for all the solutions.
[01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:41.215]  I just gave you a few of my ideas.
[01:13:41.515 --> 01:13:42.616]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:13:42.656 --> 01:13:53.899]  Maybe with the people that is in the know like you and the other people that's on the different shortwave stations talking about all this information, a forum established
[01:13:55.151 --> 01:13:57.833]  Well, we can't have one group.
[01:13:57.954 --> 01:14:03.358]  We can't have one group because any command and control model is easily infiltrated and defeated.
[01:14:04.259 --> 01:14:10.785]  We've got to have separate battle groups in the Info Wars simultaneously attacking different strata of the Big Lie.
[01:14:11.946 --> 01:14:12.587]  Thanks for the call.
[01:14:12.627 --> 01:14:14.308]  Good to hear from you.
[01:14:14.869 --> 01:14:17.091]  Let's talk to Hank in Texas.
[01:14:17.131 --> 01:14:17.711]  Hank, go ahead.
[01:14:19.673 --> 01:14:20.574]  Good afternoon.
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:33.785]  I just wanted to make you aware of a DVD that can be found in Blockbusters, any of the DVD video tape stores.
[01:14:33.945 --> 01:14:39.287]  It's called 9-11 by the French reporters, where they have firefighters saying, you see those bombs go off.
[01:14:39.787 --> 01:14:44.228]  Well, there's another one that is pushing the idea
[01:14:47.639 --> 01:14:49.880]  That the towers could collapse.
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:52.062]  It's called... Why the towers fell?
[01:14:53.142 --> 01:14:55.664]  Anatomy of the collapse is what it's called.
[01:14:56.125 --> 01:15:05.171]  World Trade Center anatomy... Yeah, they got about 10 different videos produced by the government and others, PBS and others, telling us how this magically could happen.
[01:15:05.211 --> 01:15:09.073]  But the engineers, the certifiers say it is impossible.
[01:15:09.294 --> 01:15:12.576]  But again, in those videos, they don't describe how Building 7 fell.
[01:15:12.796 --> 01:15:14.117]  Folks, it wasn't hit by a plane!
[01:15:14.617 --> 01:15:15.117]  Oh, you're right.
[01:15:15.157 --> 01:15:15.998]  You're right about that.
[01:15:16.038 --> 01:15:16.398]  You're right.
[01:15:16.418 --> 01:15:19.239]  I'm just saying that this is now in the public domain.
[01:15:19.619 --> 01:15:35.347]  It's Discovery Channel that put this out, and they have animations of what happened, and they primarily focus on the fact that these connectors were the beams connected to the outside
[01:15:36.848 --> 01:15:44.954]  But in the official report, the government even admits that's not true, because they can't, because the companies will sue them, because that isn't true.
[01:15:45.495 --> 01:15:47.336]  Yeah, but this is out there.
[01:15:47.356 --> 01:15:48.357]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:15:48.397 --> 01:15:56.764]  Well, they admit giant beams, more support columns than the other buildings out there, with huge quantities of asbestos sprayed onto it.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.922]  Yeah, they try to answer all these things.
[01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:05.227]  Find out how and why the two towers once thought to be indestructible were reduced to rubble.
[01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:10.813]  And find out why a building two blocks away completely imploded from two tiny fires in it.
[01:16:11.053 --> 01:16:12.694]  And why Larry Silverstein said he blew it up.
[01:16:13.055 --> 01:16:15.197]  Yeah, they don't even touch buildings at all.
[01:16:15.357 --> 01:16:18.360]  Okay, well I just thought I'd let you know about this thing.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:18.961]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:19.021 --> 01:16:19.721]  Thank you for letting me know.
[01:16:19.801 --> 01:16:20.402]  I've seen it.
[01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:21.183]  I actually own it.
[01:16:21.716 --> 01:16:21.956]  Okay.
[01:16:22.457 --> 01:16:22.977]  Thanks for the call.
[01:16:23.517 --> 01:16:24.678]  I've watched about five of those.
[01:16:24.698 --> 01:16:25.839]  I know there's about ten of them out.
[01:16:25.859 --> 01:16:27.020]  They're making new ones every day.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:35.266]  It's like Caracas had the big 80-story building or 75-story building burned for two days.
[01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:36.607]  Nothing happened.
[01:16:37.347 --> 01:16:38.148]  Nothing collapsed.
[01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:43.011]  But then they were sure to tell us in the news, well, some sheetrock did fall.
[01:16:43.071 --> 01:16:44.893]  You know, some stairwells had some problems.
[01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:46.994]  Yeah, but the structure doesn't collapse.
[01:16:47.335 --> 01:16:47.795]  Thanks for the call.
[01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:51.931]  Folks, they've had, they've had hotel fires that burned for a week!
[01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:54.171]  For the whole things of burnout husk!
[01:16:55.091 --> 01:16:56.372]  IT DOESN'T HAPPEN!
[01:16:56.772 --> 01:16:58.172]  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
[01:17:01.193 --> 01:17:01.333]  Ah!
[01:17:02.773 --> 01:17:04.373]  You can tell I'm a little bit angry today, folks.
[01:17:05.294 --> 01:17:08.294]  If it spills over to those running the show and those calling in, it's not personal.
[01:17:08.414 --> 01:17:09.695]  I, I just, it gives me a headache.
[01:17:10.735 --> 01:17:12.275]  Uh, let's talk to, good points, Hank.
[01:17:12.655 --> 01:17:14.215]  Dan in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[01:17:16.136 --> 01:17:16.336]  Hello?
[01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:21.789]  Okay, well you know what, since we got the calls all mixed up, we'll just go to calls after the break here.
[01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:23.549]  I know we're getting all these clips together.
[01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:26.891]  That's another clip that's on our website somewhere on Prison Planet.
[01:17:27.491 --> 01:17:30.112]  Firefighters talk about bombs going off.
[01:17:30.672 --> 01:17:35.514]  We even recorded that a year ago or so, but it's got bleeps all over it because they're cussing.
[01:17:37.193 --> 01:17:43.996]  And we'll try to, as if I haven't thrown enough at my people running things, try to do a search on video of firefighters talking about bombs.
[01:17:44.396 --> 01:17:50.859]  There's actually two different clips, and there's one with cops and firefighters, and another with firefighters going, did you see the bombs?
[01:17:50.919 --> 01:17:51.099]  Yeah!
[01:17:51.119 --> 01:17:52.920]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.000]  Then it came down!
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:57.681]  That's a good clip to play too, but we'll have to, half of it's bleeped out.
[01:17:57.742 --> 01:17:59.202]  We have it unbleeped on the website.
[01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:01.103]  Because it's just documentary evidence.
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:03.060]  That's another thing.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:08.824]  I've got complaints now because I've got quotes from major magazines of Arnold, Cushing, and saying profane things.
[01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:10.585]  Well, why do you have this on your site?
[01:18:10.785 --> 01:18:11.886]  You know, he's your governor.
[01:18:11.926 --> 01:18:13.947]  He's the one that spoke at your Republican convention.
[01:18:14.227 --> 01:18:14.968]  It's a document.
[01:18:15.008 --> 01:18:16.989]  We have to show what he said and done.
[01:18:17.009 --> 01:18:21.952]  He's not bad for saying it, but I'm bad for reporting it and posting it.
[01:18:22.933 --> 01:18:23.713]  That's another thing.
[01:18:24.574 --> 01:18:25.614]  Like, I got complaints.
[01:18:25.854 --> 01:18:27.575]  Your website is now profane.
[01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:29.917]  You have video of Bush flipping people off.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:31.260]  You shouldn't!
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.441]  He's the one flipping people off!
[01:18:34.742 --> 01:18:35.682]  You gotta show it!
[01:18:35.702 --> 01:18:41.625]  You know, that's the argument they use for, you know, don't show these out-of-control gay parades.
[01:18:42.025 --> 01:18:42.745]  Don't show that!
[01:18:42.785 --> 01:18:43.485]  It's profane!
[01:18:43.765 --> 01:18:45.026]  That's the whole point!
[01:18:46.547 --> 01:18:48.027]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:48.127 --> 01:18:49.548]  I am hopping mad.
[01:18:49.588 --> 01:18:51.188]  I feel major rants coming on.
[01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:52.229]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.929 --> 01:18:56.710]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.210 --> 01:19:00.631]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:19:01.131 --> 01:19:01.791]  Let's update.
[01:19:02.312 --> 01:19:05.773]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:19:06.433 --> 01:19:10.155]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:19:10.835 --> 01:19:11.775]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:19:11.815 --> 01:19:14.136]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[01:19:14.656 --> 01:19:15.556]  Today, the U.S.
[01:19:15.576 --> 01:19:17.817]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:19:18.197 --> 01:19:19.718]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:19:20.305 --> 01:19:22.286]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[01:19:23.627 --> 01:19:28.510]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:31.651]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[01:19:32.052 --> 01:19:34.613]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:19:35.248 --> 01:19:36.629]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:38.771]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:19:39.192 --> 01:19:41.174]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:19:41.574 --> 01:19:43.676]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:19:45.858 --> 01:19:48.000]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:48.681]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:59.102]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:59.442 --> 01:20:03.524]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:03.824 --> 01:20:04.365]  We listened.
[01:20:04.685 --> 01:20:09.667]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:09.947 --> 01:20:10.427]  We listened.
[01:20:10.808 --> 01:20:13.849]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:14.269 --> 01:20:14.809]  We listened.
[01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:18.131]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[01:20:18.251 --> 01:20:18.731]  We're good
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:44.502]  That's toll-free, 803-4438.
[01:20:44.542 --> 01:20:45.724]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:52.967 --> 01:20:56.548]  Every hour of every day, someone out there is suffering from hemorrhoids.
[01:20:56.848 --> 01:20:59.369]  The pain, worry, and embarrassment can be devastating.

[01:21:08.151 --> 01:21:11.092]  My husband had been suffering from a painful hemorrhoid for years.
[01:21:11.452 --> 01:21:14.153]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[01:21:14.513 --> 01:21:18.254]  I ordered HEMTAB online, and soon after taking HEMTAB, the pain was gone.
[01:21:18.494 --> 01:21:20.415]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[01:21:20.715 --> 01:21:21.175]  Miracle?
[01:21:21.395 --> 01:21:22.556]  Hem Miracle, we call it.

[01:21:52.604 --> 01:21:59.545]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[01:22:00.805 --> 01:22:04.866]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:22:05.586 --> 01:22:12.608]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[01:22:13.507 --> 01:22:22.275]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[01:23:01.828 --> 01:23:03.469]  Going out on the AM and FM dial.
[01:23:04.798 --> 01:23:07.201]  From great affiliates like our affiliate in Providence, Rhode Island.
[01:23:07.241 --> 01:23:10.084]  To an affiliate that goes into Los Angeles, California.
[01:23:10.124 --> 01:23:11.085]  To Austin, Texas.
[01:23:11.105 --> 01:23:12.547]  To Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:23:12.567 --> 01:23:14.249]  From Pensacola, Florida.
[01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:16.291]  To Illinois, my friends.
[01:23:16.792 --> 01:23:18.975]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave during the day at 9.985.
[01:23:19.115 --> 01:23:19.936]  And at night at 3210.
[01:23:23.504 --> 01:23:26.186]  And of course at Infowars.com, PrisonPilot.com.
[01:23:26.426 --> 01:23:35.631]  Let me get through a bunch of these calls and I'm going to slowly and calmly go through a bunch of the other news and then get back into WTC7 plus the latest Arnold Schwarzenegger information.
[01:23:35.851 --> 01:23:37.132]  In fact, we'll just do this now.
[01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:40.614]  We're about to go to Arnold in the Groves and call her making a joke, I guess.
[01:23:40.894 --> 01:23:48.639]  But before we do that, here's the ad by the group Amend for Arnold, sponsored by Fascist Pigs Incorporated.
[01:23:49.884 --> 01:23:54.465]  And this is a group run by one of his top campaign managers, the head of his finance committee.
[01:23:55.845 --> 01:24:01.486]  And this lady is out there peddling this.
[01:24:01.506 --> 01:24:06.747]  So here's the 30-second ads starting in California that are going to run nationwide.
[01:24:06.807 --> 01:24:07.247]  Here it is.
[01:24:08.228 --> 01:24:10.128]  You cannot choose the land of your birth.
[01:24:10.688 --> 01:24:13.729]  You can choose the land you love.
[01:24:13.749 --> 01:24:15.869]  12 million people have chosen America.
[01:24:16.667 --> 01:24:18.808]  Now America wants to choose them.
[01:24:19.148 --> 01:24:20.869]  Help us amend the Constitution.
[01:24:21.329 --> 01:24:24.691]  On average, we've amended it every eight years for the past century.
[01:24:24.811 --> 01:24:27.012]  And now is the time to amend it again.
[01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:32.054]  Help us amend for Arnold and 12 million other Americans.
[01:24:32.094 --> 01:24:35.336]  Join us at AmendForArnold.com.
[01:24:35.396 --> 01:24:36.937]  Paid for by AmendUs.org.
[01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:42.451]  And it's a front group for Arnold, but I mean, he's got all his minions.
[01:24:42.791 --> 01:24:43.951]  He's got Jay Leno.
[01:24:44.372 --> 01:24:46.412]  He's got the water bearer John McCain.
[01:24:46.773 --> 01:24:47.893]  He's got Rohrabacher.
[01:24:47.993 --> 01:24:49.194]  He's got Senator Hatch.
[01:24:49.714 --> 01:24:57.098]  And Rohrabacher was quoted last week in the San Jose Mercury News as saying, yes, Republicans want him for president in 08 when Bush leaves.
[01:24:57.278 --> 01:24:57.918]  It's official.
[01:24:57.978 --> 01:24:58.879]  We think he can do it.
[01:25:00.639 --> 01:25:05.902]  Well, yes, I'd kind of like to shoot for the top, but you know I'm too focused on California right now.
[01:25:06.162 --> 01:25:08.083]  No, all you're focused on is being president.
[01:25:08.869 --> 01:25:13.891]  It's a sick elite joke on us that somebody who says they admire Hitler will probably be our next president.
[01:25:14.671 --> 01:25:16.632]  Let's go ahead and take calls.
[01:25:16.692 --> 01:25:18.992]  Well, let's go to Arnold from the Grove.
[01:25:19.933 --> 01:25:21.353]  Arnold from Bohemian Grove.
[01:25:21.413 --> 01:25:22.154]  Welcome, Arnold.
[01:25:22.574 --> 01:25:23.814]  Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:25:23.854 --> 01:25:28.076]  It's so good to talk to the great Alex Jones.
[01:25:28.816 --> 01:25:30.336]  Yes, it's true.
[01:25:30.356 --> 01:25:35.158]  You've seen all the headline news this weekend that run these type of things.
[01:25:35.778 --> 01:25:38.139]  Every 30 minutes they're telling the people that they're
[01:25:38.686 --> 01:25:42.948]  Wanting me to be president and these type of things, this, you know, things of this nature.
[01:25:43.648 --> 01:25:56.393]  But, uh, seeing that I have taken a long time to find out that tyranny, tyranny is necessary to transform society.
[01:25:56.893 --> 01:26:07.638]  And, strangely enough, it is the fondest hope of the most maniacal tyrants and things of this nature for humanity to rise up and one day destroy it.
[01:26:09.713 --> 01:26:17.639]  Well, this is your, hold on, this is your long lost brother, Mineheart, Alos, let me tell you Arnold, I like you, you're named after my brother.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:24.925]  Now, I mean, it's just sick to sit here and watch all this happen, and watch me now, believe me, later I'm going to butcher your freedom.
[01:26:25.763 --> 01:26:31.908]  Yes, yes, and I also plan to notify and further radicalize the gay community for when the scandal comes out about, you know, my
[01:26:50.598 --> 01:26:55.320]  The gay pornography that I did and things of this nature, that they will then be allied with me!
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:58.742]  I thought it was fantastic, all the money I made!
[01:26:59.122 --> 01:27:01.103]  Well, and it was further hilarious!
[01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:03.204]  All the gay community fell!
[01:27:03.624 --> 01:27:12.889]  Fell for the... fell for the bait, and now, yay, yes, now you have the privilege of registering with the government and these type of things.
[01:27:13.389 --> 01:27:14.609]  Good work, Alex Jones!
[01:27:14.929 --> 01:27:16.590]  We hope you destroy us one day!
[01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:17.611]  Ha ha ha!
[01:27:21.337 --> 01:27:24.638]  Well, my sincere goal is to defeat Schwarzenegger.
[01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:27.439]  And we've got some major plans in the works.
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:31.961]  And we're going to educate people with his own disgusting words.
[01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:37.964]  We've got links on the site, folks, but parental discretion advised, we're not putting it on the site.
[01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:42.986]  Some of the photos that are out there that are confirmed, we will not link to, though.
[01:27:43.526 --> 01:27:46.387]  But it's... This guy is something else.
[01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:53.496]  Hey, you're a Christian conservative at the Grove if you bust in the male prostitutes, quote, and top gay porn stars, quote, service you.
[01:27:54.377 --> 01:27:56.138]  Oh, Bush is up the Lord!
[01:27:56.458 --> 01:27:58.179]  He's up the Lord!
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:07.085]  When he's not at the Shinto Shrine summoning demons, when he's not praying to Allah, he's telling you how Christian he is, but he doesn't go to church, but he really does go to church, though, folks.
[01:28:07.125 --> 01:28:08.186]  He's a skull and bones-er.
[01:28:09.047 --> 01:28:11.228]  I guess that Lucifer has given him great power.
[01:28:12.449 --> 01:28:16.552]  We're gonna break and come back and quickly go to some other calls and get into all the news here.
[01:28:17.475 --> 01:28:24.460]  But yes, again, it's a testament to the elite backing and how they can cover something up.
[01:28:26.061 --> 01:28:30.263]  He admires Hitler, he hates black people, all of this stuff.
[01:28:31.544 --> 01:28:34.046]  Anti-gun, anti-border, anti-sovereignty.
[01:28:36.608 --> 01:28:38.129]  Pro-abortion, so you love him!
[01:28:39.429 --> 01:28:40.050]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:46.739]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.619 --> 01:28:50.420]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.681 --> 01:28:58.823]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glasser, a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[01:28:58.943 --> 01:29:00.184]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[01:29:00.364 --> 01:29:00.924]  Thank you, Marvin.
[01:29:01.104 --> 01:29:04.465]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[01:29:04.645 --> 01:29:05.205]  Is that true?
[01:29:05.405 --> 01:29:06.386]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[01:29:06.426 --> 01:29:09.407]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[01:29:09.447 --> 01:29:09.687]  price.
[01:29:09.907 --> 01:29:12.009]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[01:29:12.049 --> 01:29:12.769]  They're very common.
[01:29:12.849 --> 01:29:16.032]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[01:29:16.072 --> 01:29:16.332]  price.
[01:29:16.612 --> 01:29:17.773]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[01:29:17.793 --> 01:29:20.195]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[01:29:20.395 --> 01:29:24.218]  Tamoxifen you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[01:29:24.259 --> 01:29:24.519]  price.
[01:29:24.879 --> 01:29:27.261]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[01:29:27.561 --> 01:29:29.522]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[01:29:29.562 --> 01:29:31.642]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[01:29:31.882 --> 01:29:36.784]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.

[01:29:53.553 --> 01:29:57.456]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:29:57.676 --> 01:30:03.120]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.

[01:30:13.927 --> 01:30:18.250]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria and cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:30:18.370 --> 01:30:19.251]  We're good to go!
[01:30:33.544 --> 01:30:38.030]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[01:30:53.431 --> 01:30:57.394]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[01:30:57.834 --> 01:31:04.899]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.
[01:31:05.279 --> 01:31:09.342]  With an ozone generator, you can kill bacteria and viruses in your drinking water.
[01:31:09.882 --> 01:31:13.163]  Get rid of that stale air in your house that keeps recirculating.
[01:31:13.543 --> 01:31:18.385]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[01:31:18.845 --> 01:31:23.506]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises for one of the most affordable ozone generators available today.
[01:31:23.947 --> 01:31:26.107]  That number is 800-569-4340.
[01:31:27.168 --> 01:31:36.270]  The ozone generator is portable, has an internal blower for ozone disbursement into the air, and comes with a tube attachment for ozonating liquids.
[01:31:36.651 --> 01:31:37.991]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[01:31:38.311 --> 01:31:44.133]  Coming up in a few minutes, I'm going to air some audio we haven't aired here on the broadcast yet and then play some of the audio we've played up teen times like
[01:32:07.501 --> 01:32:10.603]  Larry Silverstein saying they pulled Building 7 or demolished it.
[01:32:11.644 --> 01:32:16.627]  Then I want to get back into Arnold, Secretary of State Powell leaving, and a lot more.
[01:32:16.967 --> 01:32:20.789]  By the way, I'm not a political genius, but I just know how things work, okay?
[01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:22.931]  And why did Ashcroft resign?
[01:32:22.971 --> 01:32:24.072]  Why is Powell leaving?
[01:32:24.432 --> 01:32:26.693]  Why are these people leaving about half Bush's cabinet?
[01:32:27.334 --> 01:32:28.374]  Well, Bush told U.S.
[01:32:28.414 --> 01:32:33.718]  News & World Report, who has a direct pipeline in, boy, you want to know where the real reporting is, it's there.
[01:32:34.318 --> 01:32:35.779]  Bush said, told them,
[01:32:36.545 --> 01:32:40.247]  Because these guys are lightning rods and give us bad publicity.
[01:32:40.567 --> 01:32:43.929]  This is in the current report on presentplanet.com.
[01:32:44.469 --> 01:32:48.692]  And because they were getting tired and weren't energetic to carry out my policies.
[01:32:50.152 --> 01:32:50.833]  Yeah, I say so.
[01:32:50.913 --> 01:32:53.054]  Butchering America probably gets pretty tiring.
[01:32:54.415 --> 01:32:57.056]  Probably doesn't feel too good at the end of the day if you're not a total sociopath.
[01:32:58.297 --> 01:32:59.717]  Again, Ashcroft's a front man.
[01:32:59.757 --> 01:33:02.799]  He actually fought for liberties back when he was a senator in some cases.
[01:33:03.459 --> 01:33:04.440]  We've got his voting records.
[01:33:05.535 --> 01:33:08.837]  That's why Alberto I Love Torture Gonzalez is so bad.
[01:33:09.097 --> 01:33:12.239]  He is an actual brain like Rowe.
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:18.063]  Not just a stupid puppet, but a very intelligent, cunning creature.
[01:33:19.155 --> 01:33:20.716]  Very serious, just like Roe.
[01:33:20.776 --> 01:33:22.037]  Very cunning creature as well.
[01:33:22.557 --> 01:33:26.220]  The architect of torture, the architect of Section 802 making us all terrorists.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:29.582]  The architect of the FEMA training that homeschoolers are terrorists.
[01:33:29.902 --> 01:33:35.686]  The architect of no parental powers over your 8 year old, your 12 year old.
[01:33:37.227 --> 01:33:38.368]  I thought it was down to 12.
[01:33:38.408 --> 01:33:41.910]  He actually argued for any age being able to have an abortion without telling you.
[01:33:44.481 --> 01:33:49.524]  There was a Texas case of a nine-year-old, and just other cases in other states down to age eight.
[01:33:49.664 --> 01:33:50.945]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:54.847]  But it's being hidden from conservatives, as usual.
[01:33:55.908 --> 01:33:59.810]  Very serious, and now Bush is out saying, we're getting rid of them because they're lightning rods.
[01:34:00.170 --> 01:34:01.731]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[01:34:02.071 --> 01:34:03.512]  Actually worse than the old boss.
[01:34:03.532 --> 01:34:05.173]  The new people they're getting are going to be even worse.
[01:34:06.934 --> 01:34:08.995]  They're talking about rice for Secretary of State.
[01:34:11.837 --> 01:34:12.557]  Just amazing.
[01:34:14.446 --> 01:34:17.770]  And again, they'll say, well, she's black, well, he's Hispanic, you gotta be for him.
[01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:19.371]  We can find somebody else.
[01:34:19.752 --> 01:34:20.172]  Great!
[01:34:20.593 --> 01:34:22.695]  Put a black person in as Secretary of State.
[01:34:22.975 --> 01:34:24.757]  Put a Hispanic in as Attorney General.
[01:34:24.877 --> 01:34:25.638]  I don't care!
[01:34:25.818 --> 01:34:26.139]  Great!
[01:34:26.199 --> 01:34:26.519]  Do it!
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:30.003]  Make them all so-called minorities if they're just for freedom.
[01:34:31.625 --> 01:34:35.489]  In fact, I'd be for the entire government being Mexicans if they just loved freedom.
[01:34:36.238 --> 01:34:38.220]  Are all the government being white guys?
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:39.200]  They were just for freedom.
[01:34:39.361 --> 01:34:40.962]  I don't care what color you are!
[01:34:41.122 --> 01:34:44.164]  Just leave my children's future alone, you criminals!
[01:34:46.546 --> 01:34:46.686]  Ah!
[01:34:47.847 --> 01:34:48.888]  Well, I'm sick of it!
[01:34:49.589 --> 01:34:51.370]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:52.891]  I don't know who's up next.
[01:34:52.991 --> 01:34:53.972]  Clint in Missouri.
[01:34:54.353 --> 01:34:55.013]  Go ahead, Clint.
[01:34:55.553 --> 01:34:56.094]  Yes, Alex.
[01:34:56.174 --> 01:34:56.654]  Can you hear me?
[01:34:57.235 --> 01:34:57.835]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:59.056 --> 01:35:03.660]  Well, I'm sure glad you touched on all these resignations, because that's exactly what I was calling about.
[01:35:04.781 --> 01:35:06.723]  I'm going to say something that's probably going to be bold.
[01:35:07.523 --> 01:35:13.927]  I don't think it's anything you haven't said, but the similarities between this administration and Hitler are just amazing.
[01:35:14.919 --> 01:35:37.112]  Homeland Security in the U.S., Reich Security, meaning land security in Germany, same black uniforms, same regional governorships, same secret arrest policies, and the Bush's funded Hitler when the black men's in the 50's for him, but the Nazis fling to Argentina and Texas, and New Mexico, and on top of it, they love Arnold, I mean, it's incredible!
[01:35:37.532 --> 01:35:41.094]  Then he gets elected, and half his cabinet's gonna be gone,
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:44.582]  At the same time, this is mainstream news.
[01:35:44.602 --> 01:35:46.724]  I've seen this in a judge report last night.
[01:35:47.965 --> 01:35:51.248]  He's going to shake down the CIA and get all the disloyalists out of it.
[01:35:51.468 --> 01:35:53.710]  Oh, by the way, they're pitching this.
[01:35:53.970 --> 01:35:54.951]  That's also in U.S.
[01:35:54.971 --> 01:35:55.771]  News and World Report.
[01:35:55.811 --> 01:35:56.472]  I even have it here.
[01:35:56.852 --> 01:36:00.095]  They're pitching it as a cleaning house.
[01:36:00.415 --> 01:36:02.757]  Stopping these guys who let 9-11 happen.
[01:36:02.837 --> 01:36:05.519]  No, the CIA isn't covering up anymore.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.161]  And these are people that don't want to be part of this.
[01:36:08.462 --> 01:36:09.662]  And they're kicking them all out.
[01:36:09.903 --> 01:36:11.324]  And they're calling it a reform.
[01:36:12.284 --> 01:36:15.265]  They're weeding out the men that try to prevent this from happening.
[01:36:15.805 --> 01:36:19.247]  And in the meantime, this all is related to his cabinet.
[01:36:20.547 --> 01:36:25.749]  What the man is doing is building his innermost circle of trust.
[01:36:25.789 --> 01:36:28.550]  His henchmen that will go along with him, right or wrong.
[01:36:28.690 --> 01:36:30.371]  Yeah, now we've learned from U.S.
[01:36:30.411 --> 01:36:38.593]  News & World Report that they're getting rid of these cabinet members because they were quote, we're not addressing the agenda with enough energy.
[01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:39.994]  Right.
[01:36:40.898 --> 01:36:44.219]  And it's just amazing to me, and really it's scary.
[01:36:44.299 --> 01:36:49.960]  All these people leaving have great praise for them, and I honestly think these people are scared to tell the truth.
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:55.961]  Well, also, Ashcroft is out chastising federal judges that are against secret arrest of citizens.
[01:36:55.981 --> 01:36:59.321]  Well, you're going to cause another terror attack, and it's all your fault.
[01:36:59.521 --> 01:37:00.522]  No, you are!
[01:37:00.982 --> 01:37:04.362]  Because you left our borders wide open, and because you funded the terrorists!
[01:37:04.682 --> 01:37:05.983]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:37:06.243 --> 01:37:07.043]  I'm from Missouri.
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:11.542]  You know, the Dixie Ticks are ashamed Bush is from Texas?
[01:37:12.603 --> 01:37:15.004]  I'm ashamed Ashcroft came out of my state.
[01:37:15.705 --> 01:37:22.529]  Well, I've been a big detractor of Ashcroft, but let me tell you, compared to Gonzales, he's a cakewalk.
[01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:38.080]  Oh, and World Net Daily had a big write-up about Gonzales, how pro-abortion he is, and you talk about how much of a gun grabber he is, and yet all these people around me, just surrounding me here in Missouri, are so happy, so breathing a sigh of relief,
[01:37:38.613 --> 01:37:40.615]  Alex, I'm living around a bunch of fools.
[01:37:40.635 --> 01:37:43.138]  That might be mean to say, but they are.
[01:37:43.198 --> 01:37:44.039]  They're a bunch of fools.
[01:37:44.059 --> 01:37:45.060]  You can preach the truth
[01:37:58.914 --> 01:38:04.816]  Listen, I'm on conservative talk shows and they go, now wait a minute Alex, Arnold's really fixed the state.
[01:38:05.056 --> 01:38:08.838]  Their deficit that they built up in a decade has doubled in 11 months.
[01:38:09.998 --> 01:38:10.618]  Let me finish.
[01:38:10.838 --> 01:38:11.559]  Let me finish.
[01:38:13.283 --> 01:38:25.147]  Stem cell research, abortion on demand, used baby parts, banning rifles, just wall to wall, involved in Enron, and I gotta hear these people tell me how good and conservative he is?
[01:38:26.047 --> 01:38:30.128]  I know exactly how you feel because it's just very frustrating to me.
[01:38:30.848 --> 01:38:35.089]  You can give these people piles of evidence and it's to the point now they are brainwashed.
[01:38:35.870 --> 01:38:36.970]  Some of them are waking up
[01:38:37.463 --> 01:38:39.965]  Most of them just get angry that you show them the truth.
[01:38:40.125 --> 01:38:43.968]  Well, they think because they give you a false choice that, oh, you must be for Kerry.
[01:38:44.749 --> 01:38:45.169]  No!
[01:38:45.209 --> 01:38:46.250]  They control both.
[01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:47.691]  This is how they're doing it.
[01:38:47.711 --> 01:38:48.291]  Thanks for the call.
[01:38:48.592 --> 01:38:48.932]  Thank you.
[01:38:49.192 --> 01:38:49.953]  They control both.
[01:38:49.993 --> 01:38:52.975]  It's like Arnold couldn't have won if he didn't have die-bolt machines.
[01:38:52.995 --> 01:38:53.656]  That's probably why.
[01:38:53.676 --> 01:38:55.617]  But he showed some real evidence of fraud there.
[01:38:55.637 --> 01:38:57.759]  But he wasn't running against Davis.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:00.081]  Gray Davis just laid down.
[01:39:00.501 --> 01:39:01.522]  And Gray Davis was horrible.
[01:39:01.762 --> 01:39:03.043]  But frankly, he's better than Arnold.
[01:39:05.271 --> 01:39:06.551]  Never thought I'd hear myself saying that.
[01:39:06.572 --> 01:39:10.413]  There have been more gun laws passed since Arnold got in than when Davis was in there!
[01:39:10.553 --> 01:39:11.993]  And the conservatives don't care!
[01:39:12.974 --> 01:39:14.454]  Oh, you're for abortion!
[01:39:15.514 --> 01:39:18.115]  Oh, you're for not telling parents!
[01:39:18.835 --> 01:39:20.276]  For parental consent for abortion!
[01:39:20.776 --> 01:39:23.557]  Gonzales and Schwarzenegger, we just love you!
[01:39:25.618 --> 01:39:26.778]  Oh, you're so great!
[01:39:28.659 --> 01:39:28.799]  Ah!
[01:39:30.899 --> 01:39:32.360]  Let's talk to Ken in Rhode Island.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:33.020]  Ken, go ahead.
[01:39:34.216 --> 01:39:38.381]  I just wanted to tell you that, um, I was hoping to hear you on the radio today.
[01:39:39.202 --> 01:39:41.465]  And, um, they took off your, uh, radio station.
[01:39:41.485 --> 01:39:48.212]  The guys from the Yanks, uh, the Alex Jones Show, from 1 to 3 here, they took off the power hour, 8 o'clock, everything.
[01:39:48.232 --> 01:39:48.953]  They took it right off.
[01:39:49.534 --> 01:39:50.835]  And, um... When did that happen?
[01:39:51.696 --> 01:39:52.517]  Uh, starting today.
[01:39:53.218 --> 01:39:54.780]  And they say it's a permanent change?
[01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:59.352]  Yeah, this guy, I could tell by listening to him, he was a jerk.
[01:40:00.332 --> 01:40:02.233]  What station is that in Rhode Island?
[01:40:02.953 --> 01:40:04.034]  W-A-R-L-13.
[01:40:04.074 --> 01:40:07.175]  Yeah, we've been on that for about a year and a half before that was another station.
[01:40:07.215 --> 01:40:10.416]  I'm hearing we're going to get another affiliate in Rhode Island.
[01:40:10.656 --> 01:40:11.276]  And that happens.
[01:40:11.336 --> 01:40:12.957]  Stations come, stations go.
[01:40:13.357 --> 01:40:15.918]  For every two stations we gain, we lose a station.
[01:40:16.258 --> 01:40:25.082]  In fact, we always seem to stay at about the same level of stations, and that's why every person needs to call every AM and FM station out there and tell them, pick up the Alex
[01:40:25.222 --> 01:40:31.829]  Yeah, but do you know where, like, which radio station you're going to have now here for whatever it is?
[01:40:31.849 --> 01:40:35.072]  No, I just know there's been talk of that station being sold, and that's why that's happening.
[01:40:35.313 --> 01:40:39.677]  You know, that's the biggest thing we face, is stations being sold, and stations, you know, I mean, that happens.
[01:40:39.717 --> 01:40:45.283]  I mean, here locally, they just, Clear Channel just changed the formats of all their stations.
[01:40:45.363 --> 01:40:48.046]  It just happens every couple of years to every station.
[01:40:48.743 --> 01:40:49.403]  How would I listen?
[01:40:49.423 --> 01:40:50.584]  How would we listen here?
[01:40:51.145 --> 01:40:55.487]  InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or on shortwave.
[01:40:55.547 --> 01:40:57.949]  By shortwave you can hear me great, day and night.
[01:40:58.829 --> 01:41:00.911]  Okay.
[01:41:01.091 --> 01:41:04.233]  9.985 during the day or 3210 at night.
[01:41:04.893 --> 01:41:05.834]  Okay, you're the greatest, man.
[01:41:05.854 --> 01:41:06.434]  You're the greatest.
[01:41:06.474 --> 01:41:07.435]  I mean, keep up the good work.
[01:41:07.475 --> 01:41:07.815]  Thank you.
[01:41:07.855 --> 01:41:08.755]  I appreciate the call.
[01:41:09.536 --> 01:41:12.818]  Yeah, you know, stuff like that happens and I've been hearing that was going to happen.
[01:41:14.292 --> 01:41:14.833]  What do you do?
[01:41:14.853 --> 01:41:16.814]  You know, we get a few new affiliates, we lose a few.
[01:41:16.834 --> 01:41:29.584]  But I've been doing so many radio interviews, I have been on so many other talk shows, that really my show is becoming more acceptable now because so many people agree with it, that a lot of stations are turning me on.
[01:41:30.405 --> 01:41:32.726]  But forget it if they're Clear Channel or CBS.
[01:41:34.108 --> 01:41:34.508]  Forget it.
[01:41:37.110 --> 01:41:39.752]  Go, but even some of the medium-sized groups are putting me on.
[01:41:40.570 --> 01:42:09.049]  A lot of the, you know, families and companies, I don't know, maybe 50 stations, 100 stations, 10 stations, 1 station, a lot of little thousand waters, a lot of 5,000 waters, some 10,000 waters, some FM's, 100,000 watt FM's, a lot of those out there, so just keep calling them, calling them, calling them, tell them to go to GCNLive.com, got all the satellites, we got the ABC satellite for them, we got the Clear Channel satellite for them, we got analog for them, tell them, turn us on!
[01:42:09.727 --> 01:42:10.628]  Put us on at night.
[01:42:10.848 --> 01:42:11.869]  See the response you get?
[01:42:11.889 --> 01:42:13.271]  Then we'll be on during the day.
[01:42:13.732 --> 01:42:14.913]  It's up to you to lobby.
[01:42:15.313 --> 01:42:18.096]  And if you've got a local AM or FM picking us up, call them.
[01:42:18.437 --> 01:42:19.378]  Thank them for carrying it.
[01:42:19.498 --> 01:42:20.379]  Call their sponsors.
[01:42:20.739 --> 01:42:21.640]  Thank them for carrying it.
[01:42:21.961 --> 01:42:23.302]  Get us on more stations.
[01:42:25.084 --> 01:42:26.446]  But you can't stop the run.
[01:42:26.466 --> 01:42:29.029]  You can't stop the blitz.
[01:42:29.089 --> 01:42:30.050]  You can't stop us.
[01:42:30.894 --> 01:42:32.295]  It's exploding everywhere.
[01:42:32.315 --> 01:42:34.195]  The polls, CNN, 90%.
[01:42:35.016 --> 01:42:41.899]  I said 89 that day, but when the poll closed it was 90% out of 8,000 plus respondents believe the government's covering up 9-11.
[01:42:41.919 --> 01:42:43.399]  There should be a new investigation.
[01:42:43.759 --> 01:42:45.560]  The Zogby poll two months ago said 49%.
[01:42:46.921 --> 01:42:47.761]  See how it's growing?
[01:42:50.822 --> 01:42:54.564]  Alright, here are the clips, then we'll go back to your calls and a bunch of other news.
[01:42:55.945 --> 01:42:57.625]  Now this... You know what?
[01:42:57.665 --> 01:42:57.925]  Pause.
[01:43:00.359 --> 01:43:15.926]  This first clip is a clip where, on PBS, the head construction engineer, the manager of the construction of the WTC Tower 1 and 2, says it's designed to take multiple large jet collisions.
[01:43:15.966 --> 01:43:16.746]  Let's go ahead and play that.
[01:43:20.137 --> 01:43:26.080]  The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it.
[01:43:26.621 --> 01:43:29.262]  That was the largest plane at the time.
[01:43:29.903 --> 01:43:44.111]  I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door.
[01:43:44.991 --> 01:43:46.592]  This intense grid.
[01:43:47.461 --> 01:43:52.104]  And the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting.
[01:43:52.584 --> 01:43:55.185]  It really does nothing to the screen netting.
[01:43:55.606 --> 01:44:00.228]  You're not supposed to question authority in a Corwellian police state.
[01:44:01.029 --> 01:44:02.209]  Let's hit pause there.
[01:44:02.389 --> 01:44:04.631]  We'll pause it through each clip if we can do that.
[01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:05.271]  Is that possible?
[01:44:07.032 --> 01:44:07.352]  Okay, good.
[01:44:07.372 --> 01:44:08.833]  We've got them all shrunk through here.
[01:44:08.873 --> 01:44:13.796]  That's a clip again from Anthony Hilder's video that he took from PBS four years ago.
[01:44:14.794 --> 01:44:26.259]  where the head manager talks about it and you can watch that film if you're a member of PrisonPlanet.TV, that two-hour film by Hilder, 9-11 The Greatest Lie Ever Sold at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:31.822]  Okay, now the next clip, the next clip I believe is Silverstein, correct?
[01:44:33.903 --> 01:44:37.325]  This is Silverstein from America Rebuilds, one year after 9-11.
[01:44:37.705 --> 01:44:42.887]  They talk about how Tower 7 fell that afternoon, so it was the first to be rebuilt.
[01:44:42.907 --> 01:44:44.188]  So first they talk about how it fell,
[01:44:45.627 --> 01:44:47.649]  How it was rebuilt later, which they've now rebuilt it.
[01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:55.876]  And then it cuts to Silverstein saying, on the day of 9-11, they made the decision to pull it, and they show it falling as he says that.
[01:44:56.137 --> 01:45:06.426]  Then we cut to a clip where the head engineer for New York says, pull it, when they're demolishing buildings months later to clear the site, Tower 5 and 6, how pull it means demolish.
[01:45:06.466 --> 01:45:08.387]  So we'll play both those clips back-to-back.
[01:45:08.428 --> 01:45:08.828]  Here they are.
[01:45:10.845 --> 01:45:15.268]  World Trade Center 7 had always been considered the starting point for rebuilding.
[01:45:17.130 --> 01:45:22.013]  Located north of the slurry wall, 7 had been cleared faster than the rest of the site.
[01:45:23.294 --> 01:45:24.996]  And there had been no bodies to recover.
[01:45:29.019 --> 01:45:37.465]  Helted by debris when the North Tower collapsed, 7 burned until late afternoon, allowing occupants to evacuate to safety.
[01:45:38.806 --> 01:45:44.970]  I remember getting a call from the fighter bomber commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:48.572]  I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[01:45:49.632 --> 01:45:51.574]  Maybe this is one of those things to do is pull.
[01:45:52.954 --> 01:45:57.997]  And they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.
[01:45:58.818 --> 01:46:04.541]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5.
[01:46:10.912 --> 01:46:12.693]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull Building 6.
[01:46:15.393 --> 01:46:17.774]  We had to be very careful how we demolished Building 6.
[01:46:17.854 --> 01:46:27.316]  We were worried about the Building 6 coming down and then damaging the slurry wall, so we wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[01:46:28.396 --> 01:46:29.016]  Hit pause.
[01:46:29.617 --> 01:46:31.117]  Okay, and then cue it up for the next clip.
[01:46:31.617 --> 01:46:39.939]  So, again, we play Silverstein saying they blew it up that day, then we cut to them months later getting rid of the remains of 5 and 6 that were still standing,
[01:46:40.846 --> 01:46:44.248]  Uh, and where they describe pulling it as demolition and then they show that.
[01:46:44.968 --> 01:46:48.790]  Okay, now this next clip is 30 seconds after Building 7 collapsed.
[01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:52.872]  They back it back up and Dan Rather replays it and says it looks like explosives.
[01:46:53.893 --> 01:46:55.154]  Now let's go ahead and play that again.
[01:46:56.394 --> 01:46:59.216]  Here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[01:46:59.856 --> 01:47:01.957]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[01:47:09.462 --> 01:47:10.663]  Yeah, we're going to go to that after the break.
[01:47:10.683 --> 01:47:12.184]  Yeah, we don't have time to play it now.
[01:47:36.367 --> 01:47:39.329]  The next clip is Peter Jennings.
[01:47:39.989 --> 01:47:42.791]  And the reporter, they're not sure it's fallen, one of the towers.
[01:47:43.511 --> 01:47:45.132]  And then they finally are sure it's fallen.
[01:47:45.152 --> 01:47:46.833]  The guy says, it looks like explosives.
[01:47:48.334 --> 01:47:51.436]  And then somebody talks to him and he goes, oh no, no explosives.
[01:47:51.456 --> 01:47:53.697]  I mean, it's an amazing clip.
[01:47:54.277 --> 01:47:58.219]  And then another clip you might find, I know we played it probably a year ago.
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:02.622]  It's firefighters minutes after a collapse going, did you see the bombs?
[01:48:02.682 --> 01:48:03.742]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:48:04.063 --> 01:48:04.803]  And they're cussing.
[01:48:05.365 --> 01:48:06.847]  And I know we bleeped that out.
[01:48:06.907 --> 01:48:08.969]  I know that recording of him bleeping it is there somewhere.
[01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:11.733]  Maybe we can't find that in our computer.
[01:48:12.033 --> 01:48:13.555]  You can find that again on my website.
[01:48:13.575 --> 01:48:15.517]  We can bleep that out and air that next hour.
[01:48:15.557 --> 01:48:17.139]  I know you're doing a lot of great work, John.
[01:48:17.499 --> 01:48:19.942]  John's answering the phones, running the show, and getting clips for us.
[01:48:20.423 --> 01:48:21.945]  That's the incredible job he's doing.
[01:48:22.425 --> 01:48:25.469]  But we will air this Peter Jennings clip as well.
[01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:33.385]  But for those that just joined us, WTC Construction Certifiers say towers should have easily withstood jet fuel temperatures.
[01:48:33.945 --> 01:48:45.133]  They did their own test a year ago and heated it up much higher, non-treated steel, and it didn't even turn red, much less molten at 2000 degrees.
[01:48:46.333 --> 01:48:53.598]  Non-treated, non-hardened steel doesn't even start melting until over 3000 degrees in their own report on our website.
[01:48:54.499 --> 01:48:56.200]  Much less hardened steel.
[01:48:57.347 --> 01:48:58.548]  Which is even harder to melt.
[01:48:59.249 --> 01:49:04.114]  And then they talk about how the firefighters and others reported the temperatures in there weren't even very hot.
[01:49:04.955 --> 01:49:08.379]  These were paper fires, black smoke, low burning fires.
[01:49:08.779 --> 01:49:15.206]  And the pillars were treated in asbestos, which makes it even harder as an insulator.
[01:49:16.328 --> 01:49:19.151]  So it is a complete and total fraud.
[01:49:20.467 --> 01:49:28.495]  Folks, Building 7 wasn't hit by a plane, so they can say jet fuel made Tower 1 and 2 fall, which is a joke, a fraud, an impossibility.
[01:49:29.436 --> 01:49:30.617]  But what about Building 7?
[01:49:30.657 --> 01:49:31.538]  Wasn't hit by a building.
[01:49:31.999 --> 01:49:35.883]  And we have the firefighters telling the Associated Press, get back, we're about to bring the building down.
[01:49:37.685 --> 01:49:38.706]  We have that on the website.
[01:49:38.746 --> 01:49:39.967]  I mean, it's all there.
[01:49:40.107 --> 01:49:41.669]  They admit they blew it up.
[01:49:42.369 --> 01:49:43.831]  They admit they blew it up.
[01:49:45.985 --> 01:49:49.767]  Alright, we'll come back and get to more of this and just a bunch of news.
[01:49:49.827 --> 01:49:52.708]  If you want to stay with us, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:49:53.508 --> 01:49:57.850]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.030 --> 01:50:02.472]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.612 --> 01:50:06.993]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.013 --> 01:50:08.354]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.074 --> 01:50:09.975]  Panama.
[01:50:10.156 --> 01:50:14.380]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:21.388]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.508 --> 01:50:23.531]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.891 --> 01:50:34.334]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.354 --> 01:50:39.895]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:50:53.132 --> 01:50:54.733]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:54.873 --> 01:50:59.017]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:50:59.117 --> 01:51:01.999]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:02.079 --> 01:51:08.804]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:08.984 --> 01:51:11.987]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:12.187 --> 01:51:14.589]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:22.615]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:51:22.895 --> 01:51:23.916]  We're good to go!

[01:52:58.223 --> 01:53:00.124]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.605 --> 01:53:03.467]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.410 --> 01:53:14.114]  Alright, we've got a whole bunch of clips of firefighters saying they see the bombs going off, and that's all coming up the next hour.
[01:53:14.554 --> 01:53:19.537]  Here's Peter Jennings talking to reporters on the ground, and it's about four minutes long.
[01:53:19.557 --> 01:53:21.899]  We'll play part of it now, play the rest in the next hour.
[01:53:22.279 --> 01:53:23.540]  Go ahead and roll that tape.
[01:53:24.836 --> 01:53:36.146]  I just want to check one thing, because one of the very first people the President talked to was the Director of the FBI, and Cara Thomas, who covers the Justice Department and the FBI for us, has been here.
[01:53:36.166 --> 01:53:41.751]  They may think they prepare for this kind of thing here, but man, it must have been a shock.
[01:53:42.571 --> 01:53:43.912]  It's a stunning shock.
[01:53:43.952 --> 01:53:46.312]  The FBI Special Operations Center is now in full alert.
[01:53:46.753 --> 01:53:49.994]  The FBI is extremely concerned that there would be additional attacks.
[01:53:50.234 --> 01:53:58.857]  Normally when you have a situation like this, they immediately get on the line with the CIA, the various intelligence agencies, trying to get a sense of who might have been planning something.
[01:53:59.157 --> 01:54:04.218]  But right now, the first order of business is to protect against a second attack, a third attack.
[01:54:04.538 --> 01:54:09.240]  The feeling is normally when you have this kind of situation, there will be more attacks almost immediately.
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:14.563]  Let's go to the Trade Tower again, because, John, we now have a... What do we have?
[01:54:14.863 --> 01:54:20.166]  We don't... It looks like a new plume, a new large plume of smoke.
[01:54:23.267 --> 01:54:25.949]  Now, it may be that something fell off the building.
[01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:29.751]  It may be that something has fallen... We don't know, to be perfectly honest.
[01:54:29.771 --> 01:54:31.592]  But that is what you're looking at, is the current...
[01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:35.332]  That's the scene at this moment at the World Trade Center.
[01:54:35.352 --> 01:54:40.336]  Stan Daler from ABC's Good Morning America is down in the general vicinity.
[01:54:40.356 --> 01:54:41.817]  Dan, can you tell us what has just happened?
[01:54:42.018 --> 01:54:42.518]  Yes, Peter.
[01:54:42.538 --> 01:54:46.381]  Don and I were down here four blocks north of the World Trade Center.
[01:54:46.641 --> 01:54:50.524]  The second building that was hit by the plane has just completely collapsed.
[01:54:50.564 --> 01:54:54.948]  The entire building has just collapsed as if a demolition team set off.
[01:54:55.428 --> 01:55:00.352]  When you see the old demolitions of these old buildings, it blows it down on itself and it is not there anymore.
[01:55:01.994 --> 01:55:03.576]  That should be it.
[01:55:03.656 --> 01:55:06.499]  It has clearly collapsed.
[01:55:06.579 --> 01:55:07.900]  The whole side has collapsed?
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:09.922]  The whole building has collapsed.
[01:55:10.343 --> 01:55:12.705]  The whole building has collapsed?
[01:55:12.745 --> 01:55:14.127]  The building has collapsed.
[01:55:14.227 --> 01:55:16.749]  That's the southern tower you're talking about.
[01:55:16.829 --> 01:55:17.370]  Exactly.
[01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:23.116]  The second building that we witnessed the airplane enter had been, the top half had been fully involved.
[01:55:23.716 --> 01:55:24.317]  Inflamed.
[01:55:24.437 --> 01:55:25.457]  It just collapsed.
[01:55:25.517 --> 01:55:26.858]  There is panic on the streets.
[01:55:26.938 --> 01:55:33.362]  Thousands of people running up Church Street, which is what I'm looking out on, trying to get away.
[01:55:33.962 --> 01:55:46.970]  But the entire, at least as far as I can see, the top half of the building, at least half of it, I can't see below that, half of it just started with a gigantic rumble, folded in on itself, and collapsed in a huge plume of smoke and dust.
[01:55:49.125 --> 01:56:01.809]  We're talking about massive casualties here at the moment, and we have... That is extraordinary.
[01:56:01.909 --> 01:56:03.209]  There is panic on the streets.
[01:56:03.249 --> 01:56:05.169]  There are people screaming and running from the site.
[01:56:06.570 --> 01:56:10.871]  The gigantic plume of smoke has reached me, and I'm probably a quarter of a mile north of there.
[01:56:12.071 --> 01:56:14.752]  Okay, let's pause it there.
[01:56:15.232 --> 01:56:17.533]  We'll come back and play the rest in the next hour.
[01:56:18.596 --> 01:56:20.839]  Then watch him totally shift gears instantly.
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:25.344]  And then we've got a bunch of other clips where the fire department's talking about bombs.
[01:56:26.065 --> 01:56:27.366]  We'll continue with your phone calls.
[01:56:27.386 --> 01:56:29.929]  We'll get into Arnold and this group pushing for him to be president.
[01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:31.451]  That's his front group.
[01:56:31.471 --> 01:56:35.896]  We'll get into more on Gonzales, more on how they want to go into North Korea and Iran now.
[01:56:36.396 --> 01:56:37.718]  Open battle plans for this.
[01:56:39.227 --> 01:56:40.728]  A bunch of police state news.
[01:56:41.169 --> 01:56:45.132]  Before I end this hour, just briefly, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:56:45.412 --> 01:56:48.775]  You can go buy all my videos or any of the other great videos or books I carry.
[01:56:49.296 --> 01:56:53.199]  My 9-11 films are preeminent in exposing government involvement.
[01:56:53.219 --> 01:56:55.080]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror.
[01:56:55.541 --> 01:56:57.963]  Also, George Humphrey's video, 9-11, The Great Illusion.
[01:56:59.515 --> 01:57:03.677]  And Eric Huffman's 9-11, The Great Deception, get all four of those videos.

[01:57:16.623 --> 01:57:18.383]  Get them out to people or give the originals to people.
[01:57:18.884 --> 01:57:20.985]  Toll-free number to order the videos.
[01:57:21.225 --> 01:57:21.745]  Don't wait!
[01:57:22.412 --> 01:57:24.273]  Spread the word, expose the reality.
[01:57:24.933 --> 01:57:26.294]  One, eight, eight, eight.
[01:57:26.694 --> 01:57:28.275]  Two, five, three.
[01:57:28.835 --> 01:57:30.836]  Three, one, three, nine.
[01:57:31.477 --> 01:57:32.197]  That's eight.
[01:57:32.757 --> 01:57:33.458]  Eight, eight.
[01:57:33.918 --> 01:57:35.519]  Two, five, three.
[01:57:36.039 --> 01:57:37.780]  Three, one, three, nine.
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:40.321]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:40.341 --> 01:57:41.161]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.070 --> 01:57:52.111]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.831 --> 01:57:53.932]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.593 --> 01:57:55.434]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.174 --> 01:57:57.095]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.735 --> 01:58:01.658]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.919 --> 01:58:06.062]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.082 --> 01:58:08.424]  Alright, third hour.
[01:58:08.624 --> 01:58:12.947]  It is the 15th day of November 2004.
[01:58:13.047 --> 01:58:13.668]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.688 --> 01:58:14.408]  What we're doing
[01:58:20.743 --> 01:58:30.065]  Is going through the prisonplanet.com WTC Implosion section and playing clips we've never played here before.
[01:58:30.765 --> 01:58:34.966]  And playing some of the clips we have played at nauseam of the owners saying they blew it up.
[01:58:36.286 --> 01:58:39.346]  The next clip is NBC talking about the fire chief saying bombs.
[01:58:39.707 --> 01:58:42.987]  We have other clips of the firefighters themselves saying you see the bombs going off.
[01:58:43.387 --> 01:58:44.527]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:58:45.368 --> 01:58:47.488]  We'll go back to a Peter Jennings clip.
[01:58:48.158 --> 01:58:50.900]  I will play that later in the hour after we go to these other clips.
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:57.183]  We're also going to be taking your calls on any issue you want to discuss.
[01:58:57.203 --> 01:58:57.904]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:57.924 --> 01:59:02.887]  Why am I talking about this so much today?
[01:59:02.927 --> 01:59:12.192]  Because WTC construction certifiers say towers should have easily withstood jet fuel temperatures, and they say the federal government is covering something up.
[01:59:12.992 --> 01:59:22.099]  Because they've done tests on raw steel, and it doesn't even get red hot until 3,000 degrees, and they admit jet fuel doesn't burn any hotter than 1,600 degrees.
[01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:25.782]  And the fires were almost out, the firefighters reported.
[01:59:27.003 --> 01:59:32.707]  The columns were insulated in asbestos, an incredible fire retardant, also very dangerous for your lungs.
[01:59:33.644 --> 01:59:35.425]  And they said they blew the building up.
[01:59:35.485 --> 01:59:37.126]  I mean, this is a big deal, folks.
[01:59:37.266 --> 01:59:47.950]  We're going to play more of those clips and get more into what Kevin Ryan, Underwriters Laboratories, has to say about the whole cover-up that was involved in underwriting the World Trade Center complex and the steel used in it.
[01:59:48.010 --> 01:59:55.133]  Plus some good news is 50 groups joined nationally to fight the National ID Card that's on the verge of going to the President's desk.
[01:59:56.278 --> 02:00:02.761]  A group pushes for Arnold Schwarzenegger to be president to repeal the 22nd Amendment, the second article of the Constitution.
[02:00:02.781 --> 02:00:04.802]  This group is Arnold-run and controlled.
[02:00:05.542 --> 02:00:06.643]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:00:06.663 --> 02:00:12.285]  We have detailed articles on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now detailing that.
[02:00:13.186 --> 02:00:15.306]  Just ultra-massive amounts of insane news.
[02:00:15.326 --> 02:00:16.307]  We'll be covering it all.
[02:00:18.363 --> 02:00:19.644]  Oh, where does it all end?
[02:00:20.064 --> 02:00:21.926]  And of course, again, you're welcome to join us.
[02:00:21.946 --> 02:00:22.246]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:22.266 --> 02:00:22.366]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:22.386 --> 02:00:24.628]  We'll take a lot of your calls.
[02:00:25.128 --> 02:00:28.250]  We'll try to limit them to about 60 seconds or so.
[02:00:28.351 --> 02:00:30.832]  Let's go ahead and go to this next clip.
[02:00:30.852 --> 02:00:32.133]  This is NBC talking to the firefighters.
[02:00:32.153 --> 02:00:32.634]  Go ahead and hit it.
[02:00:44.665 --> 02:00:49.169]  This is what it looked like moments ago.
[02:00:49.289 --> 02:00:50.630]  My gosh.
[02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:56.614]  Okay, we're going to pause that, because that's ABC.
[02:00:57.215 --> 02:01:00.597]  What we're going to do is, we're going back to that ABC News clip later.
[02:01:01.218 --> 02:01:04.420]  We're going to air the NBC, when we were just listening to it during the break, John.
[02:01:04.921 --> 02:01:09.204]  The NBC clip, the NBC clip, where they're talking to the fire chief.
[02:01:10.265 --> 02:01:10.445]  Okay?
[02:01:10.485 --> 02:01:12.647]  And we'll do that after the break.
[02:01:14.552 --> 02:01:20.735]  We literally have about 20 clips here, and I'm in Austin, Texas, they're in Minnesota, and they're doing a great job, but it gets confusing here.
[02:01:20.755 --> 02:01:27.799]  But we're going to go back through all these clips again, all the clips we've already aired, but we're going to air the clips we have never aired before here when we get back.
[02:01:28.779 --> 02:01:35.803]  Then we're going to find that clip we aired about a year ago, the firefighters cussing, but we're going to cut the cussing out, where they're talking about, did you see the bombs going off?
[02:01:36.443 --> 02:01:39.305]  That's another clip we're going to have to clean up first before we play it.
[02:01:39.938 --> 02:01:44.661]  That is all coming up after this break and after we cover some of all the other international and national news.
[02:01:56.189 --> 02:02:01.694]  Alberto, I love Torture Gonzalez, and Arnold, I love Tyranny Schwarzenegger, and just all of them.
[02:02:01.714 --> 02:02:03.975]  We're going to cover it all after this break.
[02:02:04.016 --> 02:02:13.964]  And again, you can check out our detailed analysis of Arnold, of Gonzalez, of Powell leaving, of WTC7 and the Towers, of the Underwriters.
[02:02:14.184 --> 02:02:22.571]  All these huge breaking news reports are on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and InfoWars.net right now.
[02:02:24.572 --> 02:02:25.153]  We need to
[02:02:26.164 --> 02:02:30.269]  Realize how serious all of this is and how out in the open all this evil is.
[02:02:30.730 --> 02:02:37.939]  Now, we have the tools to expose the truth, but it's up to us, the listeners, up to us, the citizens, to take action with it.
[02:02:38.279 --> 02:02:42.424]  And when you take action with it and email it out to everybody, it is an unstoppable force.
[02:02:42.444 --> 02:02:43.105]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.158 --> 02:02:53.567]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:53.828 --> 02:02:58.553]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.794 --> 02:03:04.441]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.701 --> 02:03:05.361]  We're good to go.
[02:03:30.532 --> 02:03:31.413]  We're good to go.
[02:03:45.046 --> 02:03:48.329]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.369 --> 02:03:52.573]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:52.813 --> 02:03:55.595]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:55.795 --> 02:03:58.197]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.378 --> 02:04:07.045]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.225 --> 02:04:08.566]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[02:04:08.766 --> 02:04:12.910]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:13.770]  We're good to go.
[02:04:42.059 --> 02:04:43.549]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:47.074 --> 02:04:52.556]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:04:52.976 --> 02:04:57.197]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:04:57.437 --> 02:05:04.479]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:04.859 --> 02:05:10.961]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:11.101 --> 02:05:12.321]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:12.661 --> 02:05:15.605]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:15.765 --> 02:05:17.787]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:18.108 --> 02:05:25.336]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:05:25.637 --> 02:05:29.081]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:05:29.441 --> 02:05:32.582]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[02:05:32.942 --> 02:05:33.842]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:05:33.862 --> 02:05:34.143]  Call today.
[02:05:34.203 --> 02:05:35.223]  Big Brother.
[02:05:35.263 --> 02:05:35.763]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:35.803 --> 02:05:36.783]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:55.440]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.180 --> 02:05:57.121]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.141 --> 02:06:01.682]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.942 --> 02:06:06.082]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.223 --> 02:06:20.465]  Alright, here's a clip from PrisonPlanet.tv that's not on our Building 7 demolition section that will get added there.
[02:06:20.485 --> 02:06:21.626]  There's just so much evidence.
[02:06:21.646 --> 02:06:22.786]  How do you keep it all in one place?
[02:06:24.409 --> 02:06:26.650]  NBC's Pat Dawson is close to the scene of that attack.
[02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:49.831]  Yes, I can, Matt.
[02:06:49.872 --> 02:06:57.316]  If there is a war against terrorism that started rather ongoing right now, it started here at about quarter to nine this morning.
[02:06:57.356 --> 02:07:05.642]  As you described, a big hole in the skyline at the southern end, the southern tip of Manhattan Island, where the two World Trade Center towers had stood for the last
[02:07:06.582 --> 02:07:08.824]  25 years, 110 stories high.
[02:07:08.864 --> 02:07:09.924]  They are no longer there.
[02:07:10.825 --> 02:07:26.974]  Just moments ago, I spoke to the Chief of Safety for the New York City Fire Department, who was obviously one of the first people here on the scene after those two planes were crashed into the side, we assume, of the World Trade Center Towers, which used to be behind me over there.
[02:07:28.174 --> 02:07:34.558]  Chief Albert Curry told me that he was here just literally 10 or 15 minutes after the event.
[02:07:34.898 --> 02:07:35.958]  that took place this morning.
[02:07:35.978 --> 02:07:37.279]  That is the first crash.
[02:07:37.739 --> 02:07:40.419]  He said that at one point he had roughly 10 alarms.
[02:07:40.679 --> 02:07:46.761]  That would equate to roughly 200 to 225 New York City firefighters who were in the building.
[02:07:47.261 --> 02:07:51.122]  This was after the crash, trying to rescue civilians who were in there.
[02:07:51.382 --> 02:07:55.503]  Now, earlier this morning on the Today Show, we spoke to the director of the World Trade Center.
[02:07:55.543 --> 02:08:01.504]  He said that at that hour of the morning, you could have upwards of 10,000 people in each of those towers.
[02:08:01.824 --> 02:08:04.586]  That would be 20,000 people total in each tower.
[02:08:05.427 --> 02:08:18.677]  The Chief Safety of the Fire Department of New York City told me that shortly after 9 o'clock he had roughly 10 alarms, roughly 200 men in the building trying to effect rescues of some of those civilians who were in there.
[02:08:19.657 --> 02:08:25.722]  And that basically he received word of the possibility of a secondary device, that is another bomb going off.
[02:08:26.322 --> 02:08:31.847]  He tried to get his men out as quickly as he could, but he said that there was another explosion which took place.
[02:08:32.228 --> 02:08:43.657]  And then, an hour after the first hit here, the first crash that took place, he said, there was another explosion that took place in one of the towers here.
[02:08:44.458 --> 02:08:51.044]  So, obviously, according to his theory, he thinks that there were actually devices that were planted in the building.
[02:08:51.524 --> 02:08:53.406]  One of the secondary devices, he thinks,
[02:08:53.906 --> 02:09:00.928]  That took place after the initial impact was, he thinks, may have been on the plane that crashed into one of the towers.
[02:09:01.188 --> 02:09:07.189]  The second device, he thinks, he speculates, was probably planted in the building.
[02:09:07.909 --> 02:09:13.871]  So that's what we have been told by Albert Turry, who is the Chief of Safety for the New York City Fire Department.
[02:09:13.891 --> 02:09:15.891]  He told me that just moments ago.
[02:09:16.151 --> 02:09:18.452]  Now, we are continuing to hear explosions.
[02:09:19.492 --> 02:09:35.118]  We are continuing to hear explosions here downtown and what we've been told by some of the fire officials is that there are some gas lines that occasionally are exploding down there because obviously as you can imagine there are a lot of open gas lines down in the southern part of Manhattan.
[02:09:35.738 --> 02:09:38.159]  So again, it just goes on and on.
[02:09:38.179 --> 02:09:40.760]  Then we have several clips actually of firefighters.
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.920]  We have to cut out all their cuss words.
[02:09:43.621 --> 02:09:44.681]  Obviously they weren't excited.
[02:09:44.701 --> 02:09:46.282]  Lost a lot of friends.
[02:09:48.270 --> 02:09:50.931]  Comrades, as they say, in the structures.
[02:09:51.912 --> 02:09:59.214]  But Building 7 wasn't hit by a plane and this baby just blows up and falls and we got Larry Silverstein saying they blew it up.
[02:10:00.975 --> 02:10:05.157]  We're going to play that again later, but why did I bring all this back up today?
[02:10:05.217 --> 02:10:11.159]  Because in our WTC section, we have
[02:10:12.225 --> 02:10:17.526]  WTC construction certifiers say towers should have easily withstood jet fuel temperatures.
[02:10:17.606 --> 02:10:28.089]  The following letter was sent today by Kevin Ryan of the Underwriters Laboratories, the Frank Gale of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or the NIST.
[02:10:28.569 --> 02:10:34.971]  Underwriters Laboratories is the company that certified the steel components used in the construction of the World Trade Center towers.
[02:10:34.991 --> 02:10:36.791]  The information in this letter is of great importance.
[02:10:37.211 --> 02:10:39.232]  He goes on to say, look, why do you guys keep saying this?
[02:10:39.252 --> 02:10:40.212]  Your own test show
[02:10:40.879 --> 02:10:49.364]  That basting raw steel for days in 2,000 degree temperature with jet fuel, we've done the test, doesn't even make it red hot.
[02:10:50.644 --> 02:10:52.365]  3,000 degrees doesn't even melt raw steel.
[02:10:52.586 --> 02:10:57.108]  This was hardened steel, which doesn't even redden up until past 3,000 degrees.
[02:10:57.368 --> 02:10:58.409]  This is ridiculous.
[02:10:58.449 --> 02:10:59.469]  This is impossible.
[02:10:59.890 --> 02:11:02.571]  Jet fuel burns not even at 1,600 degrees.
[02:11:02.871 --> 02:11:05.713]  The firefighters were in the buildings and the fires were almost all out.
[02:11:05.953 --> 02:11:07.614]  People were standing in the windows.
[02:11:08.254 --> 02:11:09.595]  We've done our own test.
[02:11:10.433 --> 02:11:12.454]  All our own reports say it's impossible.
[02:11:12.874 --> 02:11:14.394]  Why do you keep saying this?
[02:11:17.355 --> 02:11:22.616]  He says your own report says it's impossible, but then you go on TV and says that the fire did it!
[02:11:24.696 --> 02:11:25.457]  And then we got Building 7.
[02:11:26.237 --> 02:11:27.377]  Wasn't hit by a plane.
[02:11:28.457 --> 02:11:29.958]  Has a few small fires in it.
[02:11:30.698 --> 02:11:32.098]  Super far away from the buildings.
[02:11:32.118 --> 02:11:33.138]  You ought to go to Ground Zero.
[02:11:33.178 --> 02:11:35.119]  They just built a new Building 7 in its place.
[02:11:35.976 --> 02:11:38.077]  Super far, I mean, it's two blocks away!
[02:11:38.437 --> 02:11:42.519]  Buildings right next door, like the Millennium Hilton, weren't even damaged!
[02:11:42.799 --> 02:11:51.844]  And then way, I mean, it's just football field after football field after football field away, it's every building Silverstein owns catches on fire and blows up!
[02:11:53.004 --> 02:11:53.985]  It's ridiculous!
[02:11:57.066 --> 02:11:59.588]  Buildings right next to it barely even got damaged when Building 7 fell!
[02:12:01.129 --> 02:12:02.610]  Got some window and fire damage.
[02:12:02.690 --> 02:12:04.370]  I mean, it just, buildings don't do this.
[02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:05.871]  Remember Caracas a month ago?
[02:12:05.891 --> 02:12:11.434]  70-something story building, burns for two days, fires shooting out of half the stories.
[02:12:11.914 --> 02:12:12.994]  Nothing collapsed!
[02:12:13.855 --> 02:12:15.075]  It doesn't collapse!
[02:12:15.195 --> 02:12:16.836]  It doesn't happen!
[02:12:17.436 --> 02:12:18.857]  It's impossible!
[02:12:21.658 --> 02:12:22.218]  Oh, man.
[02:12:22.939 --> 02:12:25.180]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:28.721]  So you gotta go get this updated WTC7 page.
[02:12:29.281 --> 02:12:30.742]  Email it out to everybody.
[02:12:32.205 --> 02:12:34.546]  We have got to get this word out to people.
[02:12:35.686 --> 02:12:37.107]  We have got to warn people.
[02:12:37.227 --> 02:12:44.390]  Alright, I'm gonna blitz through this, then we're gonna go to Frank and others.
[02:12:44.410 --> 02:12:44.790]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:12:46.291 --> 02:12:51.213]  Obviously, again, one of Schwarzenegger's former campaign managers.
[02:12:53.474 --> 02:12:54.794]  He was over his finance.
[02:12:56.495 --> 02:12:58.636]  Lisa Morgenthaler-Jones
[02:12:59.389 --> 02:13:12.716]  Big mutual fund manager in the Bay Area, and a big donor to Schwarzenegger's campaign, has set up ads all over California with AmendForArnold.com to make him El Presidente.
[02:13:14.677 --> 02:13:19.119]  They admit it's for him, and Dana Rohrabacher, the Congressman, says, yes, the Republicans want him in 08.
[02:13:19.479 --> 02:13:20.299]  Yes, it's official.
[02:13:20.319 --> 02:13:21.060]  That's what we're doing.
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:22.780]  Now it's all being admitted.
[02:13:23.401 --> 02:13:25.582]  That was in the San Jose Mercury News.
[02:13:27.205 --> 02:13:33.170]  We've had everybody from Ted Kennedy to Jay Leno to John McCain out pushing in the last three weeks.
[02:13:33.590 --> 02:13:34.711]  Arnold on 60 Minutes.
[02:13:38.915 --> 02:13:39.535]  It's incredible.
[02:13:40.056 --> 02:13:47.742]  With all his Nazi ties, all the groping, all the drug use, all the porno mags.
[02:13:49.524 --> 02:13:54.268]  I mean, if politicians date somebody in a porno mag, they gotta resign, like Gary Hart.
[02:13:54.838 --> 02:13:55.579]  But Arnold's doing it.
[02:13:55.619 --> 02:13:56.840]  It's like, oh good, that's Christian.
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:57.621]  That's conservative.
[02:13:58.883 --> 02:14:00.024]  It's unbelievable.
[02:14:00.324 --> 02:14:02.607]  So we've got that up there for you.
[02:14:04.472 --> 02:14:10.218]  Continuing here with the news, Jerusalem Post, 9-11 terror used to sell cigarettes in Israeli papers.
[02:14:10.238 --> 02:14:24.452]  A lot of Israelis are mad about this, but the ad agency in Tel Aviv makes a joke about it, and it says, you know, basically the ad says, you know, destroy America, don't smoke their cigarettes, and shows cigarettes as towers being destroyed by the better Dutch cigarettes.
[02:14:26.474 --> 02:14:28.196]  Some good news here out of Michigan News,
[02:14:29.528 --> 02:14:33.271]  Fifty groups have gotten together to denounce the National ID Card Plan.
[02:14:33.291 --> 02:14:35.633]  There's no greater threat to our personal security and liberty.
[02:14:35.913 --> 02:14:49.763]  The National ID Card System says to Weij, who is calling on supporters of the Senate to contact seven key Senators and five key Representatives, all Republicans, to have any ID Card language stripped from S-2845 and H-R-10.
[02:14:49.844 --> 02:14:51.245]  We'll get more into that later.
[02:14:52.005 --> 02:14:58.250]  Fort Bragg groups trained for Homeland Security Mission says they're going to have missions on civilian soil everywhere, but they're starting out
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:06.922]  Fort Bragg troops are going to West Point to run a drill there on the mountain and surrounding area.
[02:15:06.942 --> 02:15:09.783]  Of course, this will train the cadets for urban warfare actions.
[02:15:10.324 --> 02:15:17.006]  They say the traditional image of the military troops is going overseas, but now more than ever, troops train to go anywhere, even inside the United States.
[02:15:17.066 --> 02:15:20.568]  Just this week, Fort Bragg soldiers ran a rare training exercise in New York.
[02:15:21.241 --> 02:15:21.461]  See?
[02:15:22.001 --> 02:15:29.624]  A group of soldiers flew to New York to train in a fictional scenario in which terrorists plan to strike West Point Military Academy, the place where future Army leaders train.
[02:15:29.944 --> 02:15:32.425]  Once the Fort Bragg troops landed, the commanders were briefed.
[02:15:32.865 --> 02:15:36.846]  They predicted what fictional enemies might do and how they might do it.
[02:15:37.486 --> 02:15:41.728]  Within the whole 9-11, anything possible after that should spec... special...
[02:15:43.087 --> 02:15:46.351]  Officer David Milburn, that's where things are happening now.
[02:15:46.532 --> 02:15:51.478]  It's here in the homeland with an hour soldier set up communications to begin patrolling the mountain campus.
[02:15:52.592 --> 02:15:55.653]  One group of soldiers make up what's called the fire team during the drill.
[02:15:55.953 --> 02:15:59.515]  They walk around hours looking for anything suspicious along the perimeter.
[02:16:00.055 --> 02:16:05.777]  We're here to do a job, complete a mission, go home, said Sergeant Christian Brajas.
[02:16:05.817 --> 02:16:09.319]  The paratroopers stuck to their training details for 12 straight hours.
[02:16:09.639 --> 02:16:11.540]  The group can be ready to go anywhere within four hours.
[02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:14.761]  Most units around the country are scheduling more domestic training ops.
[02:16:15.121 --> 02:16:17.382]  Like this one, the soldiers at Fort Bragg have done three.
[02:16:19.123 --> 02:16:21.584]  Near Fallujah, a Marine commander who played
[02:16:23.027 --> 02:16:24.969]  And help plan the battle for Fallujah since U.S.
[02:16:25.009 --> 02:16:29.832]  military ground and assault troops have gone quicker than expected.
[02:16:29.852 --> 02:16:32.414]  The entire city is occupied after six days of fighting.
[02:16:33.055 --> 02:16:35.757]  At least 31 American troops have died with hundreds wounded.
[02:16:38.459 --> 02:16:38.919]  Oh boy!
[02:16:39.980 --> 02:16:41.901]  And of course the whole country's blown up.
[02:16:42.081 --> 02:16:45.664]  Ten different cities have had major problems and it just goes on and on.
[02:16:47.526 --> 02:16:47.706]  But
[02:16:49.608 --> 02:16:51.789]  Then I got articles like this, Associated Press.
[02:16:51.849 --> 02:16:52.249]  Police.
[02:16:52.649 --> 02:16:54.390]  Couple plan to sacrifice children.
[02:16:54.770 --> 02:17:00.232]  New Hampshire, a woman and her boyfriend are accused of plotting to sacrifice the women's three children on a church altar.
[02:17:00.632 --> 02:17:05.714]  Nicole Macchini, 29, and John Trubber, 35, were arrested in St.
[02:17:05.734 --> 02:17:09.915]  Mary's Church on Wednesday after workers said they heard the woman say she wanted to sacrifice the boys.
[02:17:09.935 --> 02:17:17.078]  They could tell the woman, they could tell this woman was not right, said Church Secretary Donna Landefold.
[02:17:18.544 --> 02:17:20.685]  And they're on $25,000 bail.
[02:17:20.845 --> 02:17:22.865]  Children 9, 7, and 2 are not harmed.
[02:17:22.885 --> 02:17:28.086]  Oh my gosh.
[02:17:28.246 --> 02:17:31.307]  Just a complete psychopath.
[02:17:31.927 --> 02:17:35.308]  I get reports like this every week, but the average person doesn't even know what's going on.
[02:17:35.568 --> 02:17:37.509]  They find dead kids every week.
[02:17:38.049 --> 02:17:39.469]  But it's always back of the paper.
[02:17:40.169 --> 02:17:41.510]  The Satanists are very busy.
[02:17:42.190 --> 02:17:43.450]  We'll be back with more.
[02:17:45.951 --> 02:17:47.391]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:52.211]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:17:52.611 --> 02:17:53.491]  It still is!
[02:17:54.111 --> 02:17:57.612]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:17:57.932 --> 02:17:59.732]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:18:00.292 --> 02:18:02.352]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:18:02.913 --> 02:18:04.913]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:18:05.313 --> 02:18:12.974]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:18:13.354 --> 02:18:17.095]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.
[02:18:17.791 --> 02:18:22.776]  Call this toll-free number for your free investing in Precious Metals Kit.

[02:18:49.627 --> 02:18:58.450]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:18:58.770 --> 02:19:03.452]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:19:03.912 --> 02:19:10.638]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:19:11.039 --> 02:19:22.849]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:23.289 --> 02:19:27.753]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:19:46.135 --> 02:19:50.760]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glasser, a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.122]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[02:19:52.302 --> 02:19:52.862]  Thank you, Marvin.
[02:19:53.063 --> 02:19:56.406]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[02:19:56.586 --> 02:19:57.127]  Is that true?
[02:19:57.347 --> 02:19:58.328]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[02:19:58.368 --> 02:20:01.352]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[02:20:01.392 --> 02:20:01.632]  price.
[02:20:01.852 --> 02:20:03.914]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[02:20:03.954 --> 02:20:04.695]  They're very common.
[02:20:04.775 --> 02:20:07.978]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[02:20:08.018 --> 02:20:08.278]  price.
[02:20:08.538 --> 02:20:09.719]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[02:20:09.759 --> 02:20:12.141]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[02:20:12.362 --> 02:20:16.165]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[02:20:16.185 --> 02:20:16.465]  price.
[02:20:16.826 --> 02:20:19.248]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[02:20:19.488 --> 02:20:21.510]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[02:20:21.530 --> 02:20:23.552]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[02:20:23.812 --> 02:20:28.755]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.

[02:20:45.832 --> 02:20:48.274]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:49.034 --> 02:20:54.657]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[02:20:54.697 --> 02:20:55.478]  Supreme Court.
[02:20:56.238 --> 02:21:00.540]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:04.222]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[02:21:05.163 --> 02:21:10.386]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[02:21:11.201 --> 02:21:19.503]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:21:22.844 --> 02:21:23.044]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:35.129 --> 02:21:35.710]  Call now.
[02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:42.496]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:21:48.001 --> 02:21:54.046]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:54.627 --> 02:21:57.590]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:04.582 --> 02:22:08.903]  Frank and Chris and Robert and Vince and everybody else, your calls are coming up.
[02:22:10.704 --> 02:22:20.467]  I want to continue with these WTC7 and WTC Complex clips, and then we'll get back in the news after we take some of your calls.
[02:22:20.507 --> 02:22:23.388]  There's just so much here I'm going to be going over, so please stay with us.
[02:22:25.529 --> 02:22:30.850]  This next clip, have we had a chance to cut the cuss word yet out of the firefighters?
[02:22:31.811 --> 02:22:32.951]  Okay, we'll play that later then.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.421]  Again, I already played about ten clips in the last hour, but they're coming up.
[02:22:38.041 --> 02:22:43.823]  We're going to play one clip of the firefighters right after the collapse, saying you see the bombs, you see the boom, boom, boom.
[02:22:44.244 --> 02:22:57.328]  We just played NBC saying they just interviewed the Deputy Police Chief over security, saying it was bombs, they were sure it was bombs, found some devices before the bombs went off of their firefighters in the buildings.
[02:22:58.889 --> 02:23:00.630]  We've got Silverstein saying they blew up Building 7.
[02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:04.932]  We've got all that and I guess a good place to start again.
[02:23:04.952 --> 02:23:15.238]  We're not going to play the whole clip because it's too long, but here's Peter Jennings talking to a reporter from ABC on the ground where he talks about what looks like explosives.
[02:23:15.318 --> 02:23:16.119]  Do you have that clip?
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:18.580]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:23:21.048 --> 02:23:23.049]  The whole building has collapsed?
[02:23:23.069 --> 02:23:24.450]  The building has collapsed.
[02:23:24.570 --> 02:23:27.072]  That's the southern tower you're talking about.
[02:23:27.172 --> 02:23:27.372]  Exactly.
[02:23:27.432 --> 02:23:34.697]  The second building that we witnessed the airplane enter had been, the top half had been fully involved in flames.
[02:23:34.817 --> 02:23:35.818]  It just collapsed.
[02:23:35.878 --> 02:23:37.219]  There is panic on the streets.
[02:23:37.319 --> 02:23:41.682]  Thousands of people running up Church Street, which is what I'm looking out on.
[02:23:42.762 --> 02:23:57.328]  Trying to get away, but the entire, at least as far as I can see, the top half of the building, at least half of it, I can't see below that, half of it just started with a gigantic rumble, folded in on itself, and collapsed in a huge plume of smoke and dust.
[02:23:59.523 --> 02:24:08.769]  We're talking about massive casualties here at the moment, and we have... That is extraordinary.
[02:24:08.889 --> 02:24:12.191]  There is panic on the streets.
[02:24:12.271 --> 02:24:15.533]  There are people screaming and running from the site.
[02:24:16.914 --> 02:24:21.177]  The gigantic plume of smoke has reached me, and I'm probably a quarter of a mile north of there.
[02:24:27.678 --> 02:24:33.942]  Now this is a, this is what it looked like moments ago.
[02:24:34.843 --> 02:24:42.047]  My gosh.
[02:24:46.851 --> 02:24:49.713]  A southern tower.
[02:24:53.471 --> 02:24:57.393]  10 o'clock Eastern Time this morning, just collapsing on itself.
[02:24:57.493 --> 02:24:59.754]  This is a place where thousands of people work.
[02:25:00.755 --> 02:25:02.736]  We have no idea what caused this.
[02:25:04.677 --> 02:25:16.162]  If you wish to bring, anybody who's ever watched a building being demolished on purpose knows that if you're going to do this, you have to get at the under-infrastructure of a building and bring it down.
[02:25:17.743 --> 02:25:19.565]  Yes, Dan.
[02:25:19.685 --> 02:25:24.468]  What appeared to happen from my vantage point, the top part of the building was totally engulfed in fire.
[02:25:24.508 --> 02:25:32.735]  Yeah, and then what we're going to do is we're actually going to go back earlier in that clip and play when he first starts fogging in.
[02:25:32.755 --> 02:25:37.138]  We'll also play the firefighters again that's coming up as well.
[02:25:37.158 --> 02:25:43.423]  I'm going to play it again with Silverstein and then Dan Rather and then the engineers saying, pull it means to demolish.
[02:25:44.031 --> 02:25:51.875]  We're going to play all of that, and we're also going to play the chief manager of the construction of it, saying it's designed to take multiple large jet impacts.
[02:25:53.616 --> 02:25:54.337]  Just incredible.
[02:25:54.657 --> 02:26:00.340]  But continuing now with the news and information here for you, my friends.
[02:26:02.674 --> 02:26:06.257]  Scramblejet bid to fly at 2 miles per second.
[02:26:06.677 --> 02:26:15.383]  An experimental pilotless jet will today attempt to break the world speed record by reaching 7,000 miles per hour, the equivalent of 2 miles per second.
[02:26:15.463 --> 02:26:27.451]  NASA will conduct the first and fastest test flight of its X-43A hypersonic research aircraft, known as the Scramjet, aiming to send it across the Pacific Ocean at 10 times the speed of sound.
[02:26:27.852 --> 02:26:30.854]  They successfully did this months ago, but only got it up to
[02:26:33.950 --> 02:26:36.631]  Seven times the speed of sound with the X-43A.
[02:26:38.212 --> 02:26:39.733]  Same aircraft with the scramjet.
[02:27:03.476 --> 02:27:05.077]  And, uh, globalist controllers.
[02:27:05.938 --> 02:27:09.081]  The Washington Post is getting heat for making fun of retarded people.
[02:27:09.701 --> 02:27:10.762]  I have the cartoon here.
[02:27:10.782 --> 02:27:12.844]  It is totally vicious and totally wicked.
[02:27:13.565 --> 02:27:14.445]  And indescribable.
[02:27:15.947 --> 02:27:16.807]  Just unbelievable.
[02:27:17.168 --> 02:27:18.969]  Anti-obesity, anti-smoking pill.
[02:27:19.049 --> 02:27:20.390]  Also might fight drug abuse.
[02:27:20.410 --> 02:27:23.032]  No telling what a pill like that will do to your brain.
[02:27:24.113 --> 02:27:28.097]  Miami-Dade police review taser policy after two children's shock in the last two days.
[02:27:29.338 --> 02:27:30.339]  One of them six years old.
[02:27:30.419 --> 02:27:30.719]  One of them
[02:27:32.159 --> 02:27:33.662]  12 who just tried to run away who was truant.
[02:27:34.564 --> 02:27:35.125]  Be right back.
[02:27:35.787 --> 02:27:36.689]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:38.793]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.695 --> 02:27:42.381]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.405 --> 02:27:47.886]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:27:48.106 --> 02:27:55.451]  Jerry Guadetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:27:55.751 --> 02:28:00.174]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:28:00.434 --> 02:28:10.260]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cubes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:28:11.020 --> 02:28:14.684]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:28:15.024 --> 02:28:17.526]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:28:17.546 --> 02:28:23.752]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:28:23.992 --> 02:28:25.633]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:28:25.813 --> 02:28:26.714]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:28:26.794 --> 02:28:28.776]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds.
[02:28:29.036 --> 02:28:29.757]  Every year.
[02:28:29.937 --> 02:28:30.839]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:28:30.879 --> 02:28:31.059]  That's 800-255-1912.
[02:28:31.099 --> 02:28:34.103]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:28:34.123 --> 02:28:34.844]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:28:45.859 --> 02:28:51.082]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:51.222 --> 02:28:59.305]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:28:59.566 --> 02:29:06.609]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:06.809 --> 02:29:08.090]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:29:08.170 --> 02:29:14.055]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:29:14.255 --> 02:29:19.339]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:19.459 --> 02:29:28.327]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:28.607 --> 02:29:31.889]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:29:33.851 --> 02:29:34.111]  I think?
[02:29:45.205 --> 02:29:48.268]  Dad, that cocoon stuff really got rid of your gray hair!
[02:29:48.448 --> 02:29:54.954]  I'm that 44 year old guy you've heard talking about taking Cocoon GH and how it helped reverse my gray hairs.
[02:29:55.074 --> 02:29:56.896]  And here's some more great news.
[02:29:56.996 --> 02:30:00.499]  Taking Cocoon GH can improve your life in many ways.
[02:30:00.619 --> 02:30:05.083]  Cocoon basically repairs your body to a youthful state you perhaps had 10 or 20 years ago.
[02:30:06.204 --> 02:30:08.766]  I'm taking Cocoon GH, and here's what I notice.
[02:30:08.926 --> 02:30:14.329]  After a few sprays in my mouth, I'm in peak condition mentally, emotionally, and physically.
[02:30:14.449 --> 02:30:17.411]  In the state I get from Cocoon, I feel unstoppable.
[02:30:17.711 --> 02:30:19.532]  And you can have the same feeling.
[02:30:19.792 --> 02:30:29.719]  If you're tired, run down, want to boost your sexual performance, want to help wipe out back pain or arthritis, you need to start taking Cocoon GH right now.
[02:30:30.039 --> 02:30:34.141]  If you want similar results, call now to order Cocoon GH.
[02:30:34.281 --> 02:30:35.082]  Here's the number.
[02:30:35.162 --> 02:30:43.368]  800-814-5031 800-814-5031 800-814-5031 Alright, I'm going to cover the World Trade Center collapse and give you some of the new developments just for four or five minutes.
[02:30:43.448 --> 02:30:55.756]  Then we're going to take five calls from Frank and Chris and Robert and Vince and one other person.
[02:31:05.916 --> 02:31:10.858]  And then, I'm going to blitz through literally about 20 articles, just real fast, give you my comment on them.
[02:31:11.318 --> 02:31:13.079]  So we've got about 26 minutes left here.
[02:31:13.099 --> 02:31:14.479]  I've got to move fast.
[02:31:15.740 --> 02:31:30.325]  Before I do that, the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in the United States, Ready Reserve Foods, I've gotten a two-year food supply, well, a one-year food supply for two people, to be accurate, from them.
[02:31:30.745 --> 02:31:31.786]  Very happy with it.
[02:31:31.806 --> 02:31:33.526]  The best sorbal food I've ever gotten.
[02:31:33.927 --> 02:31:34.987]  Lasted over 10 years.
[02:31:36.795 --> 02:31:39.278]  They're also offering a free booklet on Peak Oil.
[02:31:40.079 --> 02:31:43.123]  And, again, I haven't decided which side I'm on with this.
[02:31:43.143 --> 02:31:47.068]  I know they're artificially making oil scarce, and that's clearly happening.
[02:31:47.108 --> 02:31:48.410]  Energy costs are exploding.
[02:31:48.911 --> 02:31:51.234]  Very powerful booklet, though, that they're offering free.
[02:31:52.902 --> 02:31:55.823]  Because the owner of this is very concerned about it and does believe in it.
[02:31:56.243 --> 02:31:58.705]  So give them a call, we'll give you a free copy of a booklet.
[02:31:59.105 --> 02:32:03.707]  They won't pitch it, just give you a free brochure about herbal food and a free peak oil booklet.
[02:32:04.087 --> 02:32:08.409]  Give them a call 1-800-453-2202 1-800-453-2202 or link through to get their phone number at readyreservefoods.com readyreservefoods.com or 1-800-453-2202
[02:32:20.169 --> 02:32:24.593]  Again, I just really want you to sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:25.174 --> 02:32:39.868]  Eleven of my films, all my films, my weekly TV reports, most weeks two reports, always one report, my best radio interviews for members, text reports, my book, Paul Watson's book, usually an e-book costs about $6.95 online.
[02:32:40.048 --> 02:32:43.331]  You get two e-books, over 500 pages,
[02:32:45.025 --> 02:32:47.707]  11 films, over 25 hours of footage.
[02:32:47.767 --> 02:32:50.228]  My weekly TV reports, now about 50 of them up there.
[02:32:50.588 --> 02:32:56.811]  Hundreds of hours of audio interviews for 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year.
[02:32:56.831 --> 02:32:59.732]  19 cents a day if you sign up for a monthly subscription.
[02:32:59.752 --> 02:33:01.733]  $5.95 for a monthly subscription.
[02:33:01.933 --> 02:33:03.954]  Also, buy Friends and Family a subscription.
[02:33:04.434 --> 02:33:09.297]  Just go, sign up, get a passcode, email them their new passcode, tell them you got a membership.
[02:33:09.337 --> 02:33:09.837]  Go use it.
[02:33:10.586 --> 02:33:13.969]  High quality streaming, low bandwidth streaming.
[02:33:14.570 --> 02:33:16.772]  Every video's in four different formats for you.
[02:33:16.792 --> 02:33:20.275]  Two different formats, two different bandwidths, so four different formats total.
[02:33:21.377 --> 02:33:26.001]  PrisonPlanet.tv, ladies and gentlemen, you need to subscribe.
[02:33:26.121 --> 02:33:31.426]  And it helps us fund all the rest of our bandwidth and what we're doing with most of the sites being completely free.
[02:33:33.648 --> 02:33:35.310]  So it's powerful.
[02:33:35.979 --> 02:33:36.980]  And we want you to be a part of it.
[02:33:37.420 --> 02:33:39.222]  Also, Infowars.net.
[02:33:39.242 --> 02:33:40.463]  We've launched internet service.
[02:33:41.263 --> 02:33:44.166]  I mean, we got web hosting for $9.95 a month.
[02:33:45.266 --> 02:33:47.328]  Deluxe for $19.95 a month.
[02:33:47.428 --> 02:33:49.830]  Web building systems.
[02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:52.092]  Customer service 24 hours a day.
[02:33:52.732 --> 02:33:53.773]  Robinet handles it.
[02:33:53.793 --> 02:33:54.534]  They do a great job.
[02:33:54.554 --> 02:33:56.976]  They're the folks that are the backbone of my websites.
[02:33:57.696 --> 02:33:58.437]  Infowars.net.
[02:34:01.182 --> 02:34:05.525]  Just go look at the services and just know when you're with the big services they're spying on you.
[02:34:06.086 --> 02:34:12.730]  With our system we have a virtual browser, a cloaking device, where you can go up about the net and it's all cloaked.
[02:34:12.850 --> 02:34:13.511]  It's all blocked.
[02:34:15.092 --> 02:34:16.012]  And that's just standard.
[02:34:16.052 --> 02:34:17.713]  It's just built into your web surfing.
[02:34:17.893 --> 02:34:21.736]  We have hyper dial-up for the regular price of regular dial-up.
[02:34:22.176 --> 02:34:23.097]  It's really fast.
[02:34:23.857 --> 02:34:24.998]  We have DSL.
[02:34:25.919 --> 02:34:26.940]  It's all on there.
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:28.401]  Infowars.net.
[02:34:29.682 --> 02:34:34.408]  Or to buy a hard copy of any of the 11 films I've made, or any of the books or videos I carry.
[02:34:34.728 --> 02:34:37.472]  And some huge discounts up to 70% off right now.
[02:34:37.712 --> 02:34:39.955]  When you call, just ask about the different discounts for different films.
[02:34:39.975 --> 02:34:40.816]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:40.856 --> 02:34:43.959]  Just give them a call and ask about the different specials.
[02:34:48.104 --> 02:34:52.987]  Because quite frankly, I don't have time to get into it.
[02:34:53.007 --> 02:34:54.688]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:54.708 --> 02:35:04.034]  Or just go to Infowars.com and peruse the safe secure shopping cart to watch clips of the films, to see all the different specials, Infowars.com.
[02:35:05.435 --> 02:35:15.781]  Alright, again, the head organization that tested the steel and certified it as the highest quality has gone public and said, this is a total fraud,
[02:35:16.517 --> 02:35:21.581]  Junk steel doesn't even heat up to red hot, much less failing, to 3,000 degrees.
[02:35:21.961 --> 02:35:23.702]  Jet fuel burns at 1,600.
[02:35:23.962 --> 02:35:27.965]  They admit the fires were just a little over 1,000 degrees.
[02:35:28.145 --> 02:35:30.807]  They were coated in asbestos, which shielded them.
[02:35:31.167 --> 02:35:32.948]  This is a fraud and you know it!
[02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:41.074]  And so because this has now come out and more people are saying, the world is round, it ain't flat,
[02:35:42.319 --> 02:35:43.900]  I want to replay some of these clips.
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:49.725]  Now here are firefighters, minutes after the collapse, in front of a French film crew, talking about the bombs.
[02:35:50.165 --> 02:35:51.446]  They've already aired ABC.
[02:35:51.466 --> 02:35:52.727]  They've already aired NBC.
[02:35:52.767 --> 02:35:54.569]  They've already gone over it.
[02:35:54.609 --> 02:35:56.911]  And we'll play Silverstein saying they pulled it again.
[02:35:57.231 --> 02:36:00.654]  But here are the firefighters with the profanity cut out of it.
[02:36:00.694 --> 02:36:01.014]  Here it is.
[02:36:01.886 --> 02:36:02.726]  We made it outside.
[02:36:02.746 --> 02:36:03.727]  We made it about a block.
[02:36:03.967 --> 02:36:06.187]  We made it at least two blocks.
[02:36:06.347 --> 02:36:07.728]  And we started running.
[02:36:07.868 --> 02:36:10.208]  Floor by floor, it started popping out.
[02:36:10.288 --> 02:36:11.529]  It was like, it was detonating.
[02:36:11.629 --> 02:36:12.349]  Yeah, detonating.
[02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:14.330]  I was playing to take down a building.
[02:36:14.370 --> 02:36:16.070]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.710]  All the way down.
[02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:18.151]  I was watching it and running.
[02:36:18.311 --> 02:36:19.151]  It just ran up west.
[02:36:19.231 --> 02:36:22.192]  And then you just saw this cloud of **** chasing you down.
[02:36:22.872 --> 02:36:23.312]  Couldn't outrun it.
[02:36:23.332 --> 02:36:24.053]  It just ran up west for you.
[02:36:24.073 --> 02:36:24.693]  Couldn't outrun it.
[02:36:24.713 --> 02:36:25.253]  So what'd you do?
[02:36:25.313 --> 02:36:26.713]  I jumped behind a battalion car.
[02:36:26.733 --> 02:36:27.494]  I hid under the car.
[02:36:27.534 --> 02:36:28.374]  I just went and died.
[02:36:30.726 --> 02:36:31.626]  I hope you heard that.
[02:36:31.666 --> 02:36:32.987]  It's on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:36:33.027 --> 02:36:36.488]  We've got to get that particular clip moved over into the WTC7 section.
[02:36:36.908 --> 02:36:43.129]  And then there's the NBC clip we played earlier, where he's saying, yeah, let's talk to the head of the fire department security.
[02:36:43.169 --> 02:36:44.450]  He said they found bombs.
[02:36:44.490 --> 02:36:45.110]  It was bombs.
[02:36:45.530 --> 02:36:46.470]  Bombs, bombs, bombs.
[02:36:46.850 --> 02:36:48.231]  We've got the seismographs.
[02:36:48.891 --> 02:36:50.892]  We've got the explosions going off.
[02:36:51.332 --> 02:36:53.432]  We've got a modern steel building never collapsing.
[02:36:53.972 --> 02:36:55.153]  But forget Tower 1 and 2.
[02:36:55.393 --> 02:36:59.334]  We've got Building 7, and in a film called America Rebuilding,
[02:37:00.996 --> 02:37:08.379]  They describe how Building 7 fell that afternoon and how they later cleared the site first because it totally collapsed.
[02:37:09.099 --> 02:37:10.219]  Don't get confused by them.
[02:37:10.239 --> 02:37:12.260]  It's a film about the rebuilding and the clearing.
[02:37:12.780 --> 02:37:21.523]  And so they go back to the day of 9-11 and they have Silverstein showing it fall saying it was on fire, couldn't put it out, we had such a loss of life, didn't want it to spread.
[02:37:21.863 --> 02:37:25.745]  We gave the order to pull it and so we watched it and pulled it and gave the order to watch it fall.
[02:37:26.205 --> 02:37:29.206]  Then we cut to another part of the documentary where the head engineer for New York
[02:37:29.901 --> 02:37:34.905]  World Trade Center 7 had always been considered the starting point for rebuilding.
[02:37:58.513 --> 02:38:03.394]  Located north of the slurry wall, 7 had been cleared faster than the rest of the site.
[02:38:04.675 --> 02:38:06.375]  And there had been no bodies to recover.
[02:38:10.436 --> 02:38:18.859]  Pelted by debris when the north tower collapsed, 7 burned until late afternoon, allowing occupants to evacuate to safety.
[02:38:20.179 --> 02:38:26.341]  I remember getting a call from the fighter bomber commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[02:38:27.907 --> 02:38:28.107]  Okay.
[02:38:28.127 --> 02:38:28.347]  Good job.
[02:38:28.367 --> 02:38:29.348]  I told you to pull the next one.
[02:38:29.368 --> 02:38:30.028]  You're right.
[02:38:31.069 --> 02:38:31.790]  I messed you up.
[02:38:31.810 --> 02:38:38.514]  Now, here they are, months later, pulling, demolishing the remains of other buildings that, by the way, were closer to Tower 1 and 2.
[02:38:38.634 --> 02:38:41.996]  And then towers like the Hilton Millennium
[02:38:56.849 --> 02:38:59.670]  But just right next to it, not even damaged.
[02:38:59.710 --> 02:39:00.071]  Here it is.
[02:39:00.171 --> 02:39:00.431]  Roll it.
[02:39:01.371 --> 02:39:07.854]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction has leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5.
[02:39:07.935 --> 02:39:11.676]  Hello?
[02:39:13.457 --> 02:39:15.238]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull building 6.
[02:39:17.939 --> 02:39:20.341]  We have to be very careful how we demolish building 6.
[02:39:31.064 --> 02:39:33.784]  Just like you were very careful with Building 7, right?
[02:39:33.804 --> 02:39:36.125]  Between those other buildings that didn't hardly get any damage.
[02:39:36.145 --> 02:39:36.685]  You mean that?
[02:39:39.525 --> 02:39:40.805]  Oh, there's so many other clips.
[02:39:40.905 --> 02:39:44.086]  The bottom line is, again, the power of you, the listeners.
[02:39:45.126 --> 02:39:48.967]  Going to PrisonPlanet.com and mass emailing out
[02:39:49.796 --> 02:39:54.180]  Our building seven page to everybody on your email list and telling them to pass it on.
[02:39:55.881 --> 02:40:02.407]  We're doing this because CNN and NBC have demonized us last week for exposing this.
[02:40:03.167 --> 02:40:04.648]  They don't have a leg to stand on.
[02:40:04.689 --> 02:40:10.233]  Their own engineers, their own firefighters, those that certified the buildings, they're all saying it's a fraud.
[02:40:10.573 --> 02:40:14.597]  The last clip I'm going to play, we've already played Dan Rather saying it looks like bombs, we're not going to play that again.
[02:40:16.736 --> 02:40:24.448]  The chief manager of the construction of Tower 1 and 2 saying it was designed to take multiple strikes by large passenger jets.
[02:40:24.909 --> 02:40:26.111]  Here, do you have that clip?
[02:40:28.054 --> 02:40:28.595]  Let's roll it.
[02:40:32.136 --> 02:40:37.940]  The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it.
[02:40:38.461 --> 02:40:41.122]  That was the largest plane at the time.
[02:40:41.763 --> 02:40:55.973]  I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door.
[02:40:56.854 --> 02:40:58.455]  This intense grid.
[02:40:59.301 --> 02:41:03.945]  And the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting.
[02:41:04.445 --> 02:41:06.767]  It really does nothing to the screen netting.
[02:41:07.528 --> 02:41:07.828]  Okay.
[02:41:08.929 --> 02:41:10.310]  Okay, so there you have it.
[02:41:10.991 --> 02:41:11.731]  Oh, unbelievable.
[02:41:13.613 --> 02:41:15.575]  Uh, let's just rapid-fire through calls.
[02:41:16.315 --> 02:41:17.716]  Frank in Florida, thanks for holding.
[02:41:17.736 --> 02:41:18.197]  Go ahead.
[02:41:20.839 --> 02:41:21.640]  Frank, you still there?
[02:41:21.660 --> 02:41:25.343]  Chris in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:41:25.403 --> 02:41:25.843]  Go ahead.
[02:41:27.264 --> 02:41:27.524]  Hello.
[02:41:27.905 --> 02:41:28.185]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:28.933 --> 02:41:29.633]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:41:29.874 --> 02:41:30.094]  Good.
[02:41:31.154 --> 02:41:33.236]  Listen, I've got a couple of things.
[02:41:33.296 --> 02:41:34.576]  I'm kind of new to all this.
[02:41:34.696 --> 02:41:41.000]  I've had a friend of mine who kind of turned me on to you and to your website, and I've looked over it quite a bit.
[02:41:41.461 --> 02:41:45.363]  I'm still skeptical, but I'm trying to keep an open mind about all this.
[02:41:46.824 --> 02:41:48.024]  I want you to be skeptical.
[02:41:48.085 --> 02:41:49.545]  I want you to find out what I'm saying is true.
[02:41:50.026 --> 02:41:50.586]  I'm trying.
[02:41:50.886 --> 02:41:51.587]  I'm trying, brother.
[02:41:51.607 --> 02:41:51.927]  Believe me.
[02:41:53.081 --> 02:42:01.524]  Okay, I said a year and a half ago Arnold Schwarzenegger would run for president, they'd repeal the amendments, and I said he'd have front groups out pushing it soon, and now here it is in front of you.
[02:42:02.005 --> 02:42:05.626]  I mean, I just keep, I said George Bush was going to win, I mean, I don't make this stuff up.
[02:42:07.267 --> 02:42:14.750]  I just wanted to ask you, if you saw that, talking about the World Trade Center disaster, did you see the special, I believe it was on the History Channel?
[02:42:16.850 --> 02:42:20.972]  Oh, there's been a bunch of specials, you mean the one giving you the fraud of how it collapsed?
[02:42:21.616 --> 02:42:22.397]  Right, right.
[02:42:22.897 --> 02:42:29.123]  They talked with the engineer, the one that you're speaking about, the guy who designed the building back in, you know, whenever they built it.
[02:42:30.224 --> 02:42:41.974]  Okay, sir, if you go out and buy a big piece of steel, and you put it in a giant vat of jet fuel, and then you sit there and you spray oxygen on it, it might heat up red hot.
[02:42:42.015 --> 02:42:42.955]  It's not going to fall apart.
[02:42:43.796 --> 02:42:45.117]  Building 7 wasn't hit by a plane.
[02:42:46.018 --> 02:42:46.639]  How do you explain that?
[02:42:48.897 --> 02:42:56.521]  According to this show, they said it was made to withstand the impact of a jet, but the jets weren't the same size as they were.
[02:42:56.541 --> 02:42:58.942]  Sir, I just talked about Building 7.
[02:42:59.302 --> 02:43:00.603]  Building 7 wasn't hit by a jet.
[02:43:01.303 --> 02:43:01.544]  True.
[02:43:02.024 --> 02:43:02.284]  True.
[02:43:02.404 --> 02:43:04.285]  Like I said, I'm trying to... You're the firefighter saying bombs.
[02:43:04.325 --> 02:43:05.005]  Hey, sir, sir.
[02:43:05.666 --> 02:43:11.209]  Associated Press reported their reporters were told, get back, we're bringing 7 down.
[02:43:14.170 --> 02:43:15.011]  I did not hear that.
[02:43:15.211 --> 02:43:16.131]  Is it on your website?
[02:43:16.171 --> 02:43:17.632]  You have the AP article, yes.
[02:43:18.331 --> 02:43:18.631]  Okay.
[02:43:19.332 --> 02:43:23.674]  Um, another thing... Did you hear NBC saying the chief of the fire department said there were bombs?
[02:43:24.555 --> 02:43:24.995]  Heard that.
[02:43:25.956 --> 02:43:32.320]  Um, don't you think a lot of that was still in the confusion of what was still going on before they knew a lot about what happened?
[02:43:33.641 --> 02:43:40.826]  Well, this new thing by the group that certified the steel, when it was constructed, and they've done a test, they say it's impossible.
[02:43:41.246 --> 02:43:47.570]  Steel does not melt at 2,000 degrees, and the fires weren't even... people were standing in the hole.
[02:43:48.436 --> 02:43:52.595]  Have you seen the video of the people standing waving handkerchiefs for help?
[02:43:53.405 --> 02:43:53.665]  Right.
[02:43:54.045 --> 02:43:57.528]  In the holes, the fire department said, send up more ladders.
[02:43:57.868 --> 02:44:01.990]  We have two contained small fires on one building, four contained on one building.
[02:44:02.290 --> 02:44:03.231]  Send up ladders.
[02:44:03.911 --> 02:44:06.293]  And then the government said, oh, all their radios malfunctioned.
[02:44:06.313 --> 02:44:07.614]  Well, we got the radios.
[02:44:07.934 --> 02:44:09.915]  New York Daily News, the audio were on the site.
[02:44:10.435 --> 02:44:11.916]  They reported the fires were out.
[02:44:12.136 --> 02:44:16.059]  Then they started reporting bombs, and somebody hit the detonators to shut them up.
[02:44:16.379 --> 02:44:19.601]  Then the feds said the audio all malfunctioned.
[02:44:19.841 --> 02:44:20.822]  It turned out to be a lie.
[02:44:21.002 --> 02:44:22.883]  Did you hear Silverstein say they pulled the building?
[02:44:24.119 --> 02:44:24.719]  I did hear that.
[02:44:25.260 --> 02:44:30.643]  So basically, these engineers and these other people that they've had come out and say that, you know, what happened, they're all in on it.
[02:44:30.943 --> 02:44:31.824]  Is that correct?
[02:44:31.844 --> 02:44:32.964]  They've been told to shut up.
[02:44:33.004 --> 02:44:39.908]  Listen, I've called Lou Cacioli, one of the high-level fire captains who was in it, who survived it.
[02:44:40.509 --> 02:44:43.670]  He was in people going, yeah, we found the bombs, the explosions were, you know.
[02:44:44.531 --> 02:44:46.592]  And that was the first week that I called him.
[02:44:46.612 --> 02:44:47.933]  He said, Mr. Jones, I love my family.
[02:44:47.953 --> 02:44:48.813]  I've been told to shut up.
[02:44:48.833 --> 02:44:49.814]  Please don't call me again.
[02:44:50.413 --> 02:44:50.953]  Is that right?
[02:44:51.254 --> 02:44:51.934]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:44:52.894 --> 02:45:00.159]  Why don't you go get firefighters' names, or the firefighters we got on video, why don't you call their houses, like we've done, and watch them start crying on the telephone?
[02:45:00.439 --> 02:45:05.582]  Or go to New York and talk to them when they go, turn your camera off, and the guy starts crying and goes, we know the truth.
[02:45:06.922 --> 02:45:07.763]  Okay, skip that.
[02:45:07.803 --> 02:45:12.806]  How about the, uh, we're talking about the rounding us all up and putting us in these, uh, camps.
[02:45:13.641 --> 02:45:16.904]  Yeah, we've already gone from 1 million in prison to over 7 million in the system.
[02:45:17.144 --> 02:45:18.665]  They're building giant camps everywhere.
[02:45:18.885 --> 02:45:24.089]  The guy to be our new Attorney General wants us to be able to be arrested for committing any misdemeanor as an act of terrorism.
[02:45:24.529 --> 02:45:26.311]  He's also the author of the torture memo.
[02:45:27.011 --> 02:45:28.592]  Okay, who's going to do all this?
[02:45:28.892 --> 02:45:31.014]  Is it the military that's going to round all these people up?
[02:45:31.034 --> 02:45:34.837]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff have said foreign assets will do it.
[02:45:35.490 --> 02:45:36.692]  As well as special U.S.
[02:45:36.732 --> 02:45:38.955]  troops that have been given questionnaires.
[02:45:39.236 --> 02:45:40.117]  Will they fire on U.S.
[02:45:40.137 --> 02:45:40.518]  citizens?
[02:45:41.018 --> 02:45:47.688]  So they're going to come and round up their own grandmothers and grandfathers and cousins and aunts and uncles and put them in prison camps?
[02:45:47.728 --> 02:45:49.351]  Has that ever happened anywhere in the world?
[02:45:50.655 --> 02:45:51.775]  It hasn't happened in the U.S.
[02:45:51.795 --> 02:45:52.336]  that I know of.
[02:45:52.436 --> 02:45:52.936]  Oh, yeah, it did.
[02:45:52.956 --> 02:45:54.056]  It happened during the Civil War.
[02:45:54.396 --> 02:45:56.997]  I had family murdered during Reconstruction.
[02:45:57.537 --> 02:45:59.018]  Yeah, but that was hundreds of years ago.
[02:45:59.558 --> 02:46:00.858]  We don't do that now, do we?
[02:46:01.358 --> 02:46:01.718]  I don't know.
[02:46:01.778 --> 02:46:02.359]  I'm asking.
[02:46:02.399 --> 02:46:06.520]  Have you heard Michael Savage calling for putting people in forced labor camps?
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:08.360]  No, I haven't.
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:09.401]  Well, listen any day.
[02:46:09.421 --> 02:46:10.021]  He does it every day.
[02:46:11.221 --> 02:46:14.862]  Have you heard Michelle Malkin, the case for internment camps, her book?
[02:46:16.163 --> 02:46:16.363]  No.
[02:46:17.203 --> 02:46:20.244]  I got Bill O'Reilly on tape saying put people in prison that disagree with the government.
[02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:23.301]  When it comes right down to it, I've got friends in the military.
[02:46:23.842 --> 02:46:25.142]  Sir, I've been to the camps.
[02:46:25.362 --> 02:46:27.664]  You know, I have video of Marines training to put us in camps.
[02:46:29.144 --> 02:46:30.205]  I have them on video admitting it.
[02:46:31.146 --> 02:46:33.967]  With role players screaming, I'm an American, no, not the camp.
[02:46:34.187 --> 02:46:36.368]  And the interrogators going, where'd you get the guns?
[02:46:37.189 --> 02:46:37.769]  Where do you live?
[02:46:37.829 --> 02:46:38.810]  I live in San Francisco.
[02:46:39.330 --> 02:46:40.771]  I've seen that video.
[02:46:40.951 --> 02:46:43.332]  I've seen it on your website.
[02:46:43.652 --> 02:46:45.013]  Look, I wish this wasn't true!
[02:46:45.899 --> 02:46:48.161]  I got family that wants to get out of this country, brother.
[02:46:48.181 --> 02:46:49.362]  That's how serious this is.
[02:46:49.542 --> 02:46:51.203]  But we're staying for this country.
[02:46:51.504 --> 02:46:53.045]  We're going to stay, and we're going to fight.
[02:46:53.786 --> 02:46:57.128]  Well, my question is, what can we do about it?
[02:46:57.188 --> 02:46:58.249]  What can I do about it?
[02:46:58.790 --> 02:47:03.614]  Well, we can expose who's behind the terror, so when they nuke a city, everybody knows who did it.
[02:47:03.854 --> 02:47:09.438]  And so when the foreign troops come marching down our streets as the savior force, we know what to do.
[02:47:09.959 --> 02:47:13.922]  So they never do it, because they ain't going to do it unless they think we're going to go along with it.
[02:47:15.521 --> 02:47:17.262]  And why have they killed me for saying all this?
[02:47:17.302 --> 02:47:19.123]  Well they may, that may happen.
[02:47:19.303 --> 02:47:22.885]  But the point is, is that you gotta understand something.
[02:47:23.346 --> 02:47:30.790]  We've been out there burning the midnight oil, 18 hours a day, exposing them, and we've got their whole program partially stalled right now.
[02:47:30.990 --> 02:47:33.872]  We're in a death grip battle for all the cards!
[02:47:34.252 --> 02:47:36.814]  And these people call me and say, I shouldn't get upset about it!
[02:47:36.954 --> 02:47:38.695]  We should all be real upset about it!
[02:47:39.035 --> 02:47:40.556]  I am upset about it, and
[02:47:41.514 --> 02:47:55.845]  I've talked about it with my brother and he just seems to think it's all a bunch of crap and it's crazy and it's conspiracy theorist and they're all just whacked out and I'm trying to keep an open mind about it because if it all is true, I want to know what I can do about it for myself, for my friends.
[02:47:55.865 --> 02:47:57.987]  Well let me try to tell you because I had a bunch of calls.
[02:47:58.167 --> 02:47:58.927]  I appreciate the call.
[02:47:58.947 --> 02:48:00.509]  I want you to call me tomorrow when we have more time.
[02:48:00.549 --> 02:48:01.830]  I wanted to try to take everybody else's call.
[02:48:01.850 --> 02:48:02.390]  We'll try.
[02:48:02.450 --> 02:48:04.832]  Give them 45 seconds apiece or something.
[02:48:04.852 --> 02:48:05.112]  Look.
[02:48:05.873 --> 02:48:06.113]  Look.
[02:48:06.633 --> 02:48:07.074]  Listen to me.
[02:48:07.114 --> 02:48:07.974]  That's why I'm frustrated.
[02:48:08.094 --> 02:48:09.235]  I can't give you all the evidence.
[02:48:09.255 --> 02:48:09.936]  There's too much.
[02:48:10.612 --> 02:48:11.653]  It's never ending!
[02:48:12.614 --> 02:48:14.355]  We have the official U.S.
[02:48:14.435 --> 02:48:17.398]  government plan to carry out 9-11!
[02:48:17.938 --> 02:48:20.060]  It's called Operation Northwood!
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:20.881]  It's public!
[02:48:21.121 --> 02:48:22.382]  It's ABC News!
[02:48:22.602 --> 02:48:23.923]  It's Baltimore Sun!
[02:48:26.005 --> 02:48:26.966]  Or they describe it!
[02:48:28.207 --> 02:48:29.728]  The Gulf of Tonkin never happened!
[02:48:29.748 --> 02:48:30.609]  They staged that!
[02:48:31.629 --> 02:48:32.110]  The U.S.'
[02:48:32.070 --> 02:48:33.051]  's Liberty was attacked!
[02:48:33.231 --> 02:48:34.192]  They blame it on Egypt!
[02:48:34.872 --> 02:48:36.393]  Hitler blew up the Reichstag!
[02:48:39.356 --> 02:48:39.416]  Ah!
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:42.501]  We're losing this country!
[02:48:43.102 --> 02:48:43.722]  I'll be right back!

[02:51:53.385 --> 02:51:54.806]  You might even get upset about this.
[02:51:54.826 --> 02:51:58.848]  I mean, these are bad people we're fighting.
[02:51:59.068 --> 02:52:01.689]  And you can be cowards and deny it all and just not look at it.
[02:52:01.709 --> 02:52:02.449]  I know you're not, sir.
[02:52:02.489 --> 02:52:04.710]  I'm not talking about you, the last caller.
[02:52:04.830 --> 02:52:07.252]  I just get frustrated because I wish I had an hour to talk to you.
[02:52:07.572 --> 02:52:10.333]  Call me back in the first hour tomorrow and we'll talk for ten minutes.
[02:52:10.353 --> 02:52:10.973]  How's that sound?
[02:52:12.214 --> 02:52:16.396]  They're saying the Iraq vote could be delayed now for months because they created the crisis.
[02:52:17.837 --> 02:52:20.058]  Dollar wallows goes down even further.
[02:52:20.118 --> 02:52:20.858]  CNN money.
[02:52:21.318 --> 02:52:22.479]  Pentagon envisioning a
[02:52:23.246 --> 02:52:25.247]  Costly Internet War, New York Times.
[02:52:26.447 --> 02:52:29.589]  They call it a global information grid.
[02:52:29.669 --> 02:52:31.270]  Everything you do, tracked and traced.
[02:52:32.290 --> 02:52:34.851]  They call it a god-like power they're going to have.
[02:52:34.891 --> 02:52:36.732]  I mean, you just... Fourth Amendment.
[02:52:37.472 --> 02:52:40.554]  World Health Organization, batch of genetic experiments with smallpox.
[02:52:40.894 --> 02:52:44.435]  They're creating super weaponized smallpox just to study it.
[02:52:44.455 --> 02:52:47.537]  Even though the only samples are in Russian and U.S.
[02:52:47.577 --> 02:52:47.897]  labs.
[02:52:49.235 --> 02:52:50.996]  Bunch of eugenics psychopaths.
[02:52:51.596 --> 02:52:52.236]  Officials, U.S.
[02:52:52.276 --> 02:52:55.617]  planning surgical strikes on North Korea out of the Korean Times.
[02:52:56.097 --> 02:52:58.638]  The head of the Labor Party over there says he talked to the U.S.
[02:52:58.678 --> 02:52:59.658]  The plan to pull out U.S.
[02:52:59.678 --> 02:53:03.059]  troops is because they're planning to use surgical nuke strikes on North Korea.
[02:53:03.839 --> 02:53:06.200]  Ex-Soviet dissidents warn of police state in Russia.
[02:53:06.980 --> 02:53:10.401]  People who fought the Communists say Putin's the same thing, just with a different label.
[02:53:10.902 --> 02:53:12.362]  Oh, but it's Bush's favorite buddy.
[02:53:12.962 --> 02:53:15.483]  Total police state there, Putin carrying out terror attacks.
[02:53:17.147 --> 02:53:22.951]  A shameful episode in Harvard's history, how they accept and love known top Nazis as their best buddies.
[02:53:22.991 --> 02:53:36.202]  And that integrates with Arnold, with his former campaign head over finance, funding these ads that Arnold's behind with all Arnold's minions out on TV, promoting him to get rid of the second article of the Constitution and the 22nd Amendment so he can be president.
[02:53:36.422 --> 02:53:42.147]  We've got the most detailed analysis just written today and last night on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:53:42.167 --> 02:53:44.729]  Please email that to everybody and warn everyone.
[02:53:46.152 --> 02:53:55.438]  I mean, how can somebody who says he admires Hitler, and wants to be a dictator, and who poses for homosexual magazines, and is for abortion, be worshipped by conservatives?
[02:53:57.999 --> 02:53:58.119]  Ah!
[02:54:00.241 --> 02:54:02.022]  Chris, we already talked to Chris.
[02:54:02.122 --> 02:54:03.623]  Robert in Kansas, go ahead.
[02:54:04.003 --> 02:54:05.163]  Yes, Alex, can you hear me?
[02:54:05.364 --> 02:54:06.184]  Yes, I can, sir.
[02:54:06.204 --> 02:54:07.685]  My battery's about ready to go dead.
[02:54:07.845 --> 02:54:08.485]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:54:09.046 --> 02:54:12.288]  Last night on 60 Minutes, they had a CIA guy tell that
[02:54:13.383 --> 02:54:15.164]  Ben Lawton's going to nuke us any minute.
[02:54:15.205 --> 02:54:16.846]  He got the clerics approval.
[02:54:16.906 --> 02:54:17.526]  It's all over.
[02:54:17.947 --> 02:54:18.467]  Okay.
[02:54:18.627 --> 02:54:20.248]  I didn't know if you got that message or not.
[02:54:20.268 --> 02:54:22.210]  I thought it was pretty important that people hear it.
[02:54:22.350 --> 02:54:22.850]  No, it is.
[02:54:22.910 --> 02:54:24.011]  It's just more fear mongering.
[02:54:24.031 --> 02:54:25.272]  But go ahead and make your point.
[02:54:25.292 --> 02:54:25.732]  I'm sorry.
[02:54:26.313 --> 02:54:30.696]  Well, I thought it might benefit a 15-day notice or something like that from the government before they go ahead and do it.
[02:54:31.176 --> 02:54:33.398]  So they can say, see, we warned you.
[02:54:33.758 --> 02:54:36.961]  Now after the nuke went off, criticizing the government's illegal.
[02:54:37.301 --> 02:54:39.383]  We have to do it to protect ourselves.
[02:54:41.471 --> 02:54:42.632]  Yeah, that's probably what it is.
[02:54:42.652 --> 02:54:45.575]  By the way, while we're busy doing this, we're going to take all your pension funds!
[02:54:46.356 --> 02:54:49.300]  You're not going to complain too much about the Pan-American Union now, are you?
[02:54:49.980 --> 02:54:51.242]  But you did hear it, though, right?
[02:54:51.682 --> 02:54:52.503]  On 60 Minutes.
[02:54:52.523 --> 02:54:57.809]  Yeah, no, the CIA guy released that two days ago, and it was going to be on... I read how it was going to be on there last night.
[02:54:57.829 --> 02:54:59.731]  No, I didn't... He said it was going to be untold as.
[02:55:00.740 --> 02:55:04.804]  Either Nukes, Bob Kims, or I think he mentioned Bob Kim.
[02:55:04.944 --> 02:55:05.905]  Because Al C.I.A.
[02:55:06.045 --> 02:55:09.147]  to Chief Bin Laden has been given the go-ahead by his cleric.
[02:55:09.348 --> 02:55:10.629]  Yeah, it's some sort of propaganda.
[02:55:10.669 --> 02:55:11.850]  I know that because he's still looking.
[02:55:11.870 --> 02:55:13.992]  He was the head man looking for Bin Laden, you know, so.
[02:55:14.512 --> 02:55:15.013]  Oh, yeah.
[02:55:15.273 --> 02:55:16.434]  You know how that goes.
[02:55:16.454 --> 02:55:17.375]  Yeah, I know how that goes.
[02:55:17.415 --> 02:55:18.015]  Thanks, Robert.
[02:55:18.796 --> 02:55:19.416]  Bush, thank you.
[02:55:19.456 --> 02:55:21.498]  Bush says he's not too worried about Bin Laden anymore.
[02:55:21.899 --> 02:55:22.859]  Let's talk to Vince.
[02:55:23.620 --> 02:55:24.701]  Vince, go ahead.
[02:55:25.342 --> 02:55:25.742]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:55:26.383 --> 02:55:26.683]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:26.883 --> 02:55:32.186]  Last night on the Coast to Coast program they had Bill Skousen, and the host last night was Art Bell.
[02:55:32.946 --> 02:55:38.229]  And I just thought it was really despicable the way that Art Bell is in some sort of denial of the fact.
[02:55:38.289 --> 02:55:43.251]  The show was mostly about 9-11 and the Pentagon and whatnot.
[02:55:43.331 --> 02:55:49.854]  It really was despicable, and I'd like all your listeners to call up Art Bell when he's on the air and ask him to educate himself.
[02:55:50.342 --> 02:55:51.862]  Well, I'd love to go on Art Bell's show.
[02:55:51.882 --> 02:55:52.763]  Take care.
[02:55:52.783 --> 02:55:53.943]  I know George Norrie has me on.
[02:55:53.963 --> 02:55:55.063]  We appreciate him for that.
[02:55:55.123 --> 02:55:56.503]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central.
[02:56:19.668 --> 02:56:21.970]  Please get the WTC7 updated page.
[02:56:22.071 --> 02:56:22.951]  Email it out to everybody.
[02:56:23.352 --> 02:56:25.414]  Arnold being a big, fat, disgusting Nazi.
[02:56:25.754 --> 02:56:26.795]  Email that out to everybody.
[02:56:27.476 --> 02:56:32.101]  And email out the information about Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. I Love Torture.
