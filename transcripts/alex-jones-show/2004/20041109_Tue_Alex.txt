[00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.366]  Hello, my friends!
[00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:37.707]  It's already Tuesday, the ninth day of November 2004.
[00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:40.548]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:41.028 --> 00:00:43.749]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:57.874]  Remember a few weeks ago, a woman who owned a 2,000 square foot toy store that was selling knockoffs of the Rubik's Cube that they admit was legal, got a visit from Homeland Security?
[00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:02.576]  Well, now I have an article here out of Iowa
[00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:10.890]  Where a veteran, a doctor, with no criminal record, complained to the VA too much.
[00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.212]  They say he did not threaten them, but he complained.
[00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:18.254]  And so Homeland Security went and arrested him.
[00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:32.482]  And they say that we take all of the secret activities of the government very, very seriously, and we have to protect the VA, and it has to be a secret operation.
[00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:43.769]  Because, well, terrorists might want to attack us, and so anybody complaining to us too much, that distracts us from keeping everybody safe, and so you're a terrorist.
[00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.391]  That sounds insane, it is insane.
[00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:59.360]  I have another article out of Ohio, where they made the voting secret, wouldn't let anybody inside, when they had all the provisional ballots, and they declared on that national security that that had to be secret.
[00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:05.274]  Or the terrorists were going to kill everybody, basically.
[00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:10.377]  So now it's not just hate crimes or hate speech.
[00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:13.199]  Now it's just complaint speech.
[00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.442]  And it isn't just the local police that come and put you in jail.
[00:02:19.663 --> 00:02:22.125]  It is now Homeland Security.
[00:02:25.747 --> 00:02:28.989]  But if you're a convicted, aggravated felon,
[00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:38.030]  Who is an illegal alien, according to the Washington Times, they try to energetically hire you to work for the U.S.
[00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.670]  military.
[00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.273]  So if you're a real live criminal, it's like Stalin opened all the jail cells and had the criminals.
[00:02:45.954 --> 00:02:47.054]  Our government's gone further.
[00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:49.336]  They want foreigners who are criminals.
[00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:55.519]  Because a foreigner who isn't a criminal still probably won't want to do all the horrible things they've got planned for us.
[00:02:56.184 --> 00:03:05.030]  And that's all this Iraq war is about, is to get us used to all the war and to get our troops trained in takeover of cities and gun confiscation so they can come back here and do it.
[00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:07.192]  That's admitted, by the way.
[00:03:08.052 --> 00:03:13.236]  So, the battle for Fallujah is going well, they say.
[00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:16.558]  They've arrested thousands of people.
[00:03:16.778 --> 00:03:19.941]  They're not giving us troop numbers of casualties on our side.
[00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:22.462]  They're not giving us a lot of numbers on the other side.
[00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:24.444]  But if you look at the foreign video feeds,
[00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.239]  It is unmitigated carnage.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.961]  Of course, they made much of the city leave, evacuate, and where are they going to put all those people?
[00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:41.041]  So I guess they're going to go into every city and make everybody leave the city and then somehow get control that way.
[00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:42.802]  It's not going to work, my friends.
[00:03:44.222 --> 00:03:45.462]  But it's not meant to work.
[00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:46.822]  It's meant to go on and on.
[00:03:46.882 --> 00:03:48.803]  So when we get back from break, U.S.
[00:03:48.843 --> 00:03:55.604]  forces push through the center of Fallujah, tighten cordon around city to block fleeing insurgents.
[00:03:57.913 --> 00:04:00.034]  Another article here out of the London Telegraph.
[00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:01.896]  I got my kills.
[00:04:02.396 --> 00:04:04.277]  I just love my job.
[00:04:04.297 --> 00:04:07.359]  I'll be covering what U.S.
[00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:08.340]  soldiers are saying.
[00:04:09.861 --> 00:04:16.565]  Fallujah advances encountering sporadic resistance, but not as much as they thought.
[00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:19.747]  Hospital hit is fighting rages in Fallujah.
[00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:25.431]  I'm looking at photos, video stills, of the hospital exploding.
[00:04:27.822 --> 00:04:29.682]  And here's that article I mentioned a few minutes ago.
[00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:33.083]  Alone in Ohio, officials cited Homeland Security.
[00:04:33.103 --> 00:04:37.044]  This is out of the Philadelphia newspaper.
[00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:48.807]  Citing concerns about potential terrorism, Warren County officials locked down the county administration building on election night and blocked anyone from observing the vote count as the nation awaited Ohio's returns.
[00:04:49.948 --> 00:04:51.928]  And they did it to fight terror.
[00:04:52.328 --> 00:04:54.469]  You complained about not getting your benefits.
[00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:55.349]  You didn't threaten us.
[00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:57.855]  We have to secretly arrest you.
[00:04:58.035 --> 00:04:59.016]  Oh, you want to know your vote?
[00:04:59.036 --> 00:04:59.976]  We'll have to arrest you.
[00:05:03.757 --> 00:05:09.238]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.658 --> 00:05:13.899]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:21.120]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.643]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.783 --> 00:05:29.023]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.343 --> 00:05:32.304]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:34.465]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:42.008]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:45.690]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.214]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:05:49.234 --> 00:05:49.274]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.294 --> 00:05:49.515]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.635 --> 00:05:50.476]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:50.776]  Call today.
[00:06:01.383 --> 00:06:10.008]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:10.228 --> 00:06:21.495]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:24.337]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:31.164]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:33.206]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:39.413]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.673 --> 00:06:45.279]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.584]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.604 --> 00:06:50.325]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:51.026]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:05.633]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.813 --> 00:07:10.220]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.747]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.787 --> 00:07:16.189]  The New World Order.
[00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:17.889]  Panama!
[00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.151]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:29.134]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:29.274 --> 00:07:31.355]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:31.635 --> 00:07:42.200]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.401]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:45.461]  Big Brother.
[00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:46.041]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:47.402]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:48.702]  You want answers?
[00:07:48.722 --> 00:07:49.342]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.857 --> 00:08:17.841]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:22.164]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.928 --> 00:08:37.698]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:39.204 --> 00:09:02.003]  Being posted right now as we speak on InfoWars.com and coming up in about 51 minutes is a story of a gentleman with no criminal record, a veteran, complaining to the VA and being arrested by a Department of Homeland Security.
[00:09:03.704 --> 00:09:05.266]  This is out of the
[00:09:06.235 --> 00:09:13.439]  Quad City Times, QCTimes.com, headline, Agents Arrest Man in Threats.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:32.470]  Then you read the article, it says, quote, he had been harassing them for the past three years, said Calvi, we were looking at the messages and while they were no direct threats, the language was abusive and derogatory and seemed to be getting worse.
[00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:40.608]  And so they had Homeland Security go out and arrest Dr. Tennant.
[00:09:41.648 --> 00:10:01.494]  Inspectors from the Federal Protective Services Division of Homeland Security Department arrested a Bentendorf Christopher Friday, and it goes on, accused of making harassing phone calls to the Department of Veterans Affairs in Des Moines.
[00:10:03.678 --> 00:10:11.942]  And it says, Kenneth C. Tennant, 45, remained in Polk County, Iowa, jail late Friday afternoon, charged with third-degree harassment.
[00:10:13.083 --> 00:10:28.950]  Although it is a state charge and a misdemeanor, Federal Protective Services, or FPS, personnel were involved because the Virginia office is a federal facility, said Special Agent Will Calvey.
[00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:32.692]  And they go on to say after 9-11 they have to consider everything
[00:10:33.539 --> 00:10:34.159]  Terrorism.
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.060]  The F.P.S.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:47.526]  provides law enforcement and security services to more than one million tenants and daily visitors to all federally owned and leased facilities nationwide.
[00:10:47.566 --> 00:10:50.187]  According to its mission statement, F.P.S.
[00:10:50.247 --> 00:10:57.870]  focuses directly on the interior security of the nation and the reduction of crimes and potential threats to federal facilities.
[00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.111]  So this is the main
[00:11:00.174 --> 00:11:03.395]  Security Guard Law Enforcement Arm of Homeland Security.
[00:11:04.415 --> 00:11:05.335]  They're the beat cops.
[00:11:06.336 --> 00:11:13.077]  And it says, Calvi said two inspectors from Des Moines have been investigating Tenet after receiving complaints from the VA offices.
[00:11:17.038 --> 00:11:21.719]  Isn't that an interesting little blurb?
[00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:28.481]  And by the way, you read in the article here, it's two people that have been arrested for being rude to them.
[00:11:30.239 --> 00:11:38.508]  The specific nature of the calls or a dispute between Tenet and the Virginia was not divulged by FPS officials or Virginia.
[00:11:40.109 --> 00:11:46.156]  Calvi said two inspectors from Des Moines had been investigating Tenet after receiving complaints from the VA offices.
[00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:51.600]  Quote, he had been harassing them for the past three years, said Calvi.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:12:00.003]  We were looking at the messages and while they were no direct threats, the language was abusive and derogatory and seemed to be getting worse.
[00:12:04.084 --> 00:12:04.904]  Unbelievable!
[00:12:05.544 --> 00:12:15.127]  So, we have Special Agent Will Calvi admitting that he did not threaten anyone, but they're calling it a threat.
[00:12:16.423 --> 00:12:19.225]  By the way, I know Paul Watson's listening.
[00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:24.490]  I believe my wife, who's the webmaster for InfoWars.com, is listening.
[00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:37.000]  I told her this morning, she's doing a great job, to post this article, under it, post the article from two weeks ago about the lady with the toy store selling knockoffs of Rubik's Cube that turned out to be legal, because the patent's up.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.703]  She got phone calls months before, Homeland Security's coming to see you, was scared to death.
[00:12:42.084 --> 00:12:44.766]  Two months later, they finally show up at her office with no order.
[00:12:45.436 --> 00:12:46.257]  No written order.
[00:12:46.297 --> 00:12:47.177]  No judge's order.
[00:12:47.257 --> 00:12:47.977]  No conviction.
[00:12:48.038 --> 00:12:48.998]  No nothing.
[00:12:49.598 --> 00:12:54.221]  And said, remove those magic cubes from your shelves.
[00:12:55.602 --> 00:12:57.303]  Because this threatens the country.
[00:12:57.903 --> 00:12:59.244]  And she said, well why are you here?
[00:12:59.264 --> 00:13:01.445]  And she said, well, they said, we're over everything.
[00:13:02.886 --> 00:13:04.387]  It's infrastructure protection.
[00:13:06.188 --> 00:13:09.950]  And then under that we're going to post a link to the PrisonPlanet.com archive.
[00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:14.092]  Patriot Act and Homeland Security being used against
[00:13:14.784 --> 00:13:26.714]  The general public in non-terror related cases, we have, I don't know, like 50 articles on there with examples of pot dealers, county commissioners, people paying bribes to get more parking spaces zoned.
[00:13:26.734 --> 00:13:28.255]  Oops!
[00:13:28.335 --> 00:13:29.476]  Sorry, you don't get a jury.
[00:13:29.516 --> 00:13:30.957]  Sorry, you don't get due process.
[00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:34.480]  Sorry, we are going to break in your house secretly.
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.524]  We don't need warrants to surveil you because all crime is terrorism.
[00:13:41.167 --> 00:13:43.568]  And I guess now all complaining is terrorism.
[00:13:43.608 --> 00:13:45.328]  I thought the government was there to serve you.
[00:13:45.348 --> 00:13:52.670]  You know, the VA has probably the worst record of any federal agency of, quote, service in modern history.
[00:13:52.730 --> 00:14:03.713]  It's akin to the Native Americans on reservations being, you know, with the managers of the reservations selling them rotten meat and wood alcohol.
[00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.374]  Ripping them off.
[00:14:08.965 --> 00:14:09.926]  It's about the same thing.
[00:14:10.086 --> 00:14:11.967]  They're paid to not give you the services.
[00:14:12.608 --> 00:14:22.076]  They've had people die in Ohio, Virginia, Kansas, Missouri from maggot infestation.
[00:14:22.116 --> 00:14:25.539]  They just tie down the old World War II vets that are really sick.
[00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:27.056]  Give them no treatment.
[00:14:27.076 --> 00:14:30.579]  And the Kansas City Star a few years ago described rats.
[00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:33.561]  They opened the door and rats were crawling around on top of them.
[00:14:33.601 --> 00:14:37.224]  The flies go up the nose and lay eggs in the nasal cavity.
[00:14:37.564 --> 00:14:39.586]  The maggots then viciously attack the brain.
[00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:43.068]  And maggot death has happened in four states that I know of.
[00:14:44.029 --> 00:14:46.051]  In the last two, three years, we've seen four cases.
[00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:50.694]  At one hospital alone in Kansas City, it was two people died of maggot attacks.
[00:14:50.734 --> 00:14:51.895]  Several others got really sick.
[00:14:52.235 --> 00:14:54.157]  Had to have brain surgery to remove the maggots.
[00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:57.312]  In other words, maggot deaths in a lot of other areas.
[00:14:57.352 --> 00:14:58.273]  Just a maggot death.
[00:14:58.333 --> 00:14:59.653]  You know, it's death by maggot.
[00:15:00.714 --> 00:15:08.197]  So after you're done fighting over in Iraq, breathing your depleted uranium, and you come back here and you're sick, we got maggot death for you waiting.
[00:15:08.977 --> 00:15:11.539]  And that's how dirty and filthy and disgusting these are.
[00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:13.379]  And you're not allowed into these things.
[00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:18.022]  The media's not allowed into these things now, under Homeland Security, because terrorists might want to attack.
[00:15:19.022 --> 00:15:21.023]  And so we can't have video cameras inside.
[00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.411]  But we're going to have video cameras aimed at you, though, the citizenry, all over the place.
[00:15:25.811 --> 00:15:28.912]  Scanning your license plates instantly, scanning your faces.
[00:15:30.473 --> 00:15:44.018]  Folks, I can be out in the middle of nowhere in Oklahoma or Texas or Arkansas or Louisiana the last few years, driving down a road at a four-way stop, literally, with cow passers on all four sides, and there'll be cameras at every point.
[00:15:45.416 --> 00:15:53.181]  There is no small town in Texas that I haven't been to in the last few years that does not have cameras, not just on the main intersections, but on every side street.
[00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:55.903]  And now, cameras have gone up in my neighborhood.
[00:15:56.904 --> 00:16:01.307]  But you don't bring your cameras in to show maggot death, maggot torture.
[00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:03.989]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:06.750]  That's how filthy and disgusting this is, okay?
[00:16:07.851 --> 00:16:13.435]  That's how they just put them in there to die, and the flies just settle on them and enjoy themselves.
[00:16:15.894 --> 00:16:17.695]  That's how we try.
[00:16:17.736 --> 00:16:19.417]  But this veteran complains.
[00:16:20.037 --> 00:16:21.178]  And I talked to him this morning.
[00:16:21.198 --> 00:16:25.682]  One of his family members in California, his brother, called him and told him about the show.
[00:16:27.643 --> 00:16:29.144]  And he's been complaining.
[00:16:30.145 --> 00:16:31.326]  And so he was arrested.
[00:16:31.346 --> 00:16:36.310]  He was arrested last Thursday.
[00:16:38.948 --> 00:16:45.232]  He was still in jail Friday afternoon, they reported, and then got out on Saturday and tried to get in touch with me on Saturday.
[00:16:45.272 --> 00:16:46.173]  I finally got the message.
[00:16:47.033 --> 00:17:07.886]  Waiting through the hundreds of messages yesterday of people having their children taken, people having their farms and ranches taken, people being forced to give their babies inoculations and the baby goes into convulsions instantly, and they're arrested on the spot saying, oh, you abused the baby, even though they can't even get out of the hospital by the time the child goes into convulsions.
[00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:12.010]  from the vaccines and then they blame you after they damage your child.
[00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:13.411]  It's a great new little system they've got.
[00:17:14.731 --> 00:17:17.592]  Uh, just people calling with the IRS taking everything they've got.
[00:17:17.853 --> 00:17:28.777]  Uh, people calling, um, where there's ten illegals in the apartment next to them, but then they have their grandma come to visit for a month and they're thrown out of the apartment and they say, well, wait, you let ten illegals stay there and they go, shut up.
[00:17:29.917 --> 00:17:31.378]  It's just, just the new world order.
[00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:36.379]  I got stacks of articles here with mainstream news announcing the New World Order is here.
[00:17:36.999 --> 00:17:37.960]  Oh, it's glorious.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.161]  Praise Lord Bush.
[00:17:40.121 --> 00:17:41.262]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:17:42.723 --> 00:17:45.505]  I've got, uh, just, it's, it's an overload.
[00:17:45.545 --> 00:17:47.186]  But we will cover it all today.
[00:17:48.727 --> 00:17:50.168]  We're gonna have Mr. Tennant on.
[00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:52.549]  And again, it's just somebody else.
[00:17:56.712 --> 00:17:58.213]  They arrested another person here.
[00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:06.162]  So, in this article, they didn't just send Homeland Security out to arrest one person.
[00:18:06.182 --> 00:18:06.983]  There was someone else.
[00:18:07.023 --> 00:18:11.025]  I guess they said, well, we've got too many of these vets complaining they want health care.
[00:18:11.746 --> 00:18:12.606]  They were promised it.
[00:18:14.007 --> 00:18:17.289]  Well, they're not old enough to strap down and give the maggot treatment yet.
[00:18:19.491 --> 00:18:20.511]  Call in Homeland.
[00:18:20.731 --> 00:18:22.112]  I'm not even joking.
[00:18:22.713 --> 00:18:23.293]  It's kidding.
[00:18:23.813 --> 00:18:25.154]  It's getting out of control.
[00:18:25.874 --> 00:18:28.156]  So, uh, your toy store, your
[00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:30.932]  Selling a Magic Cube?
[00:18:31.292 --> 00:18:32.512]  We're going to hit you, hit you hard.
[00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:42.618]  By the way, I've got mainstream news articles of peaceful protest around the country and cops just come out with rubber bullets and open fire.
[00:18:44.098 --> 00:18:47.620]  They'll stand there and wait for one person to step off the curb, which you do.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.262]  You know, I've been at protests and you're sitting there and you're supposed to be on the sidewalk and
[00:18:51.917 --> 00:18:57.281]  Then you just step out on the curb, wave at somebody or something, and the cops run over and scream at me.
[00:18:57.781 --> 00:18:58.602]  Get back on there!
[00:18:58.682 --> 00:18:59.723]  Get back on the rescue!
[00:19:00.083 --> 00:19:01.104]  Well, you know, that's in Austin.
[00:19:01.124 --> 00:19:03.425]  At least they don't open fire.
[00:19:03.465 --> 00:19:06.547]  But all over the country now, one person steps in the street.
[00:19:06.908 --> 00:19:08.028]  They just open fire.
[00:19:08.449 --> 00:19:13.612]  There's been some more eyes lost, some more serious injuries.
[00:19:13.632 --> 00:19:15.934]  They've had to dig some more bullets out of people, rubber bullets.
[00:19:17.535 --> 00:19:21.418]  What happens is they hit an orifice, like a nose, they shoot up into the cavity.
[00:19:22.367 --> 00:19:26.610]  Or if they hit the eye, they go back behind the eye into the cavity.
[00:19:27.531 --> 00:19:29.252]  The skull's as thick as a potato chip.
[00:19:29.632 --> 00:19:31.013]  A laced potato chip right there.
[00:19:33.615 --> 00:19:35.977]  So, there's a lot of serious injuries happening.
[00:19:35.997 --> 00:19:38.798]  But the police... A bunch of taser deaths in the last week.
[00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:40.940]  Seventy in the last two years.
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.181]  But they don't care.
[00:19:42.221 --> 00:19:43.762]  They say they're going to increase the use of this.
[00:19:43.802 --> 00:19:44.783]  So what if it kills you?
[00:19:45.503 --> 00:19:48.805]  But cops are lobbying to have it banned where you can't own a taser.
[00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:50.827]  So...
[00:19:51.809 --> 00:19:55.552]  We're learning how to be slaves right now, learning how to submit and be groveling worms.
[00:19:57.313 --> 00:19:58.534]  Stay with us, PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:04.012]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[00:20:04.413 --> 00:20:07.334]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[00:20:07.474 --> 00:20:11.136]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[00:20:11.317 --> 00:20:13.758]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[00:20:13.918 --> 00:20:17.180]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:24.684]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.

[00:20:48.846 --> 00:20:53.930]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:56.513]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[00:21:01.033 --> 00:21:01.793]  Terrorism!
[00:21:01.954 --> 00:21:02.714]  Terrorism!
[00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:08.857]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:21:09.117 --> 00:21:10.698]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:13.439]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:21:13.819 --> 00:21:28.387]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:28.427 --> 00:21:28.747]  government.
[00:21:28.927 --> 00:21:30.728]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:21:31.088 --> 00:21:37.009]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:22:00.333 --> 00:22:03.354]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[00:22:03.754 --> 00:22:06.254]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[00:22:06.474 --> 00:22:13.536]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:22:13.736 --> 00:22:17.017]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[00:22:17.277 --> 00:22:19.297]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:22:19.637 --> 00:22:27.459]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering the lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:22:27.739 --> 00:22:29.020]  Either way, why chance it?
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:39.087]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.822]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:23:04.042 --> 00:23:16.307]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:23:16.727 --> 00:23:17.147]  The U.S.
[00:23:17.187 --> 00:23:22.769]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:25.370]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:23:27.231 --> 00:23:28.292]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:23:28.332 --> 00:23:31.173]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:23:31.293 --> 00:23:37.316]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:23:37.736 --> 00:23:41.098]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:23:41.178 --> 00:23:47.521]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:51.965]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:23:51.985 --> 00:23:52.185]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:52.205 --> 00:23:52.465]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:52.486 --> 00:23:53.026]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:23:53.046 --> 00:23:54.147]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.576 --> 00:24:19.157]  That's right, my friends, the ninth day of November 2004 as we accelerate towards 2005.
[00:24:19.217 --> 00:24:20.478]  Hard to believe, isn't it?
[00:24:21.838 --> 00:24:24.759]  Your phone calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:24.779 --> 00:24:26.439]  1-800-259-9231 to get involved on air.
[00:24:26.519 --> 00:24:29.940]  Patrick in Canada, John in Texas, Danny in Tennessee, your calls are coming up.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.020]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:41.920]  U.S.
[00:24:42.001 --> 00:24:48.686]  forces have pushed through the center of Fallujah, tightening a cordon around the city to block fleeing insurgents.
[00:24:49.206 --> 00:24:49.446]  U.S.
[00:24:49.526 --> 00:25:05.499]  Army and Marine units thrust through the center of the insurgent stronghold of Fallujah on Tuesday, fighting bands of guerrillas in the streets and conducting house-to-house searches on the second day of a major offensive to retake the city from Islamic militants.
[00:25:06.275 --> 00:25:23.387]  A total of 14 Americans have been killed in the past two days across Iraq, including three killed in Fallujah on Tuesday, that's so far today, and 11 others who died Monday, most of them as guerrillas launched a wave of attacks in Baghdad and southwest of Fallujah, a senior Pentagon official said.
[00:25:23.987 --> 00:25:25.448]  Well, yeah, that's the guerrilla action.
[00:25:25.488 --> 00:25:34.174]  These people are just going to melt into the shadows, disappear, and then as soon as our troops are back in their barracks, they'll be attacked again.
[00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.271]  And I'm not the one saying that.
[00:25:36.912 --> 00:25:44.078]  You know, people who are even pro-war, top special forces experts in Europe and the U.S.
[00:25:44.138 --> 00:25:46.580]  are saying, this thing is not going to work.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.481]  It is untenable.
[00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:53.966]  They can go into cities and tell the 300 and something thousand people, alright, everybody leave who isn't a terrorist.
[00:25:54.066 --> 00:25:54.827]  And then 200,000 leave and 100,000 stay.
[00:25:58.197 --> 00:26:00.999]  And by the way, that whole 100,000 aren't, you know, the insurgents.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:10.266]  Imagine, they admit, well, we're going to search you at checkpoints and put most of you in camps and break up your families and we're waiting for you at the edge of the city, so come on.
[00:26:12.167 --> 00:26:20.733]  Then imagine getting, you know, out there and walking with your family up to the checkpoint and being searched and watching your family being broke up, which they admittedly do.
[00:26:21.454 --> 00:26:24.456]  In these camps, women go to one area, men to another, children to another.
[00:26:25.177 --> 00:26:27.459]  They sometimes reunite them for torture sessions.
[00:26:27.699 --> 00:26:28.379]  That's not me!
[00:26:28.419 --> 00:26:29.480]  That's the Army's report!
[00:26:29.941 --> 00:26:31.482]  They're these giant tent cities!
[00:26:32.302 --> 00:26:35.685]  And by the way, in Police State 2000, you can see them training for that here in the U.S.
[00:26:36.145 --> 00:26:41.049]  When they have an emergency or a terror attack, they take you in, they break up the children, the women, and the men.
[00:26:41.429 --> 00:26:42.550]  They send you to different areas.
[00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:47.754]  Would you go out and line up and watch your family broke up and get put in the backs of trucks?
[00:26:48.534 --> 00:26:49.595]  I know I'm not going to do it!
[00:26:50.658 --> 00:26:58.861]  And I know that any marine or soldier that tries that is going to have a very bad day.
[00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:07.583]  Not all of us are the classic Arabs that, well, just think you just spray bullets in some magic direction.
[00:27:10.245 --> 00:27:14.287]  You know where you get your best recruits here in Texas and Alabama and Tennessee and places like that?
[00:27:14.307 --> 00:27:16.528]  Let me tell you, that's where all the patriots are at.
[00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:18.369]  And we're not going to put up with it.
[00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:23.531]  I just hope you... And again, I don't want to ever have a violent confrontation with the government.
[00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:25.412]  I believe we can avert that and fix that.
[00:27:25.792 --> 00:27:28.133]  And most of the troops have been asked, will you fire on Americans?
[00:27:28.393 --> 00:27:29.153]  And they've said no.
[00:27:29.233 --> 00:27:33.335]  But I've been to the drills where they train to break up your family.
[00:27:33.935 --> 00:27:35.676]  Where they train to confiscate your guns.
[00:27:35.976 --> 00:27:37.557]  Where they admit they're training for it.
[00:27:38.613 --> 00:27:38.953]  Okay?
[00:27:39.433 --> 00:27:41.034]  So, who out there?
[00:27:41.534 --> 00:27:42.755]  Let me ask police officers.
[00:27:42.775 --> 00:27:44.055]  Don't think your families are immune.
[00:27:44.616 --> 00:27:48.517]  There's a major disaster engineered by the Globalist, or let's say it really happens.
[00:27:49.198 --> 00:27:56.901]  How is having everybody go to these relocation centers, because we've got insurgents in the cities, how is that going to protect you and your family?
[00:28:00.923 --> 00:28:01.443]  Oh boy!
[00:28:04.384 --> 00:28:06.145]  It's just, it's just incredible.
[00:28:07.017 --> 00:28:08.718]  And again, I'm not on either side of this.
[00:28:08.838 --> 00:28:09.998]  I wish our troops were home.
[00:28:10.058 --> 00:28:11.619]  I wish they weren't breathing DU.
[00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:15.360]  They're admittedly using DU still in Iraq.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.241]  I wish they weren't giving our troops deadly vaccines.
[00:28:19.361 --> 00:28:26.484]  You know, they just let the guy off who defected to North Korea and was a spy with time served.
[00:28:28.098 --> 00:28:44.163]  But, a woman who's breastfeeding, who has an exemplary tenure record, they tell her, you've got to take the anthrax or smallpox shot, and yeah, it says on the box you're not supposed to have your breastfeeding, but you'll take it or your court-martial, and so she says no, and so they give her a felony conviction.
[00:28:46.584 --> 00:28:52.506]  But Bush gets to be AWOL, and Clinton gets to be, you know, a draft dodger, and it's just a double standard, folks.
[00:28:55.347 --> 00:28:56.768]  And our poor, poor troops,
[00:28:58.667 --> 00:29:00.448]  Over there in a war that isn't meant to be won.
[00:29:01.429 --> 00:29:02.549]  That's meant to be widened.
[00:29:03.109 --> 00:29:05.291]  That's meant to have the no-bid contracts going forever.
[00:29:05.631 --> 00:29:11.514]  And I've got this chilling article, it's brief, that I want to read when we get back.
[00:29:12.775 --> 00:29:16.036]  I've got my kills, I just love my job.
[00:29:17.937 --> 00:29:22.480]  And I've talked to a lot of veterans of World War II, Korea, Vietnam.
[00:29:25.721 --> 00:29:26.742]  And, I mean, these guys
[00:29:29.326 --> 00:29:30.646]  You know, the American soldier's tough.
[00:29:32.387 --> 00:29:35.767]  I'd say, from what we've seen in combat statistics, tougher than what we've got today.
[00:29:37.307 --> 00:29:40.448]  But they would vomit after they killed children on accident.
[00:29:40.508 --> 00:29:42.108]  They would get sick by it.
[00:29:42.148 --> 00:29:43.108]  They never got over it.
[00:29:43.908 --> 00:29:46.629]  Well, the reports we're getting is a lot of these soldiers love it.
[00:29:46.729 --> 00:29:47.809]  They want more.
[00:29:48.489 --> 00:29:49.229]  What's happened to us?
[00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:50.190]  Be right back.
[00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:52.830]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.910]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.491]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:21.864 --> 00:31:26.188]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.388 --> 00:31:27.269]  Try Halo Methane.
[00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:34.734]  And volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:31:35.014 --> 00:31:41.378]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:03.593]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:32:03.793 --> 00:32:11.139]  Jerry Goudetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:32:11.459 --> 00:32:15.862]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:25.969]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cubes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:32:26.729 --> 00:32:30.371]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:33.212]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:32:33.512 --> 00:32:39.434]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:32:39.674 --> 00:32:41.315]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:32:41.495 --> 00:32:42.395]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:32:42.475 --> 00:32:44.476]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds.
[00:32:44.716 --> 00:32:45.476]  Every year.

[00:32:46.797 --> 00:32:50.578]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[00:32:50.619 --> 00:32:51.499]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:33:13.548 --> 00:33:24.337]  Alright, I want to cover this article that's in front of me out of the London Telegraph about our soldiers and the changing mindset that you cannot ignore.
[00:33:24.357 --> 00:33:31.803]  Then we'll go to Patrick and John and Danny and David and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:31.863 --> 00:33:32.944]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:32.964 --> 00:33:33.204]  Now, before I
[00:33:41.562 --> 00:33:50.947]  cover that article, I do just want to briefly remind all the listeners that I have made eleven documentary films.
[00:33:53.108 --> 00:33:55.589]  And the eleventh film is now out.
[00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:00.232]  And that's American Dictators documenting the staged election in 2004.
[00:34:01.152 --> 00:34:09.797]  And we talk about how it's staged, how Bush and Carrier, Cousins, other members of the same organizations, how their policies are almost identical in reality, their rhetoric is different.
[00:34:10.365 --> 00:34:17.228]  We get into Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove and the police state they're setting up and some of the latest developments concerning 9-11.
[00:34:17.908 --> 00:34:24.131]  So it gives you a wide-ranging view of the latest info with The Globalist.
[00:34:24.271 --> 00:34:24.911]  It's 1995.
[00:34:27.312 --> 00:34:29.893]  1995 on DVD or VHS.
[00:34:30.033 --> 00:34:32.654]  Each additional VHS is $9.95.
[00:34:33.074 --> 00:34:35.375]  Each additional DVD is $5.95.
[00:34:36.015 --> 00:34:39.757]  I encourage you to get four or five or ten copies and to give these as gifts.
[00:34:40.342 --> 00:34:42.424]  What, a birthday present or a Christmas present?
[00:34:43.705 --> 00:34:54.897]  Give somebody an early gift and say, hey, instead of a fruit pie, or instead of a tie or something I'll never wear, or a sweater you don't like, here's an early present.
[00:34:54.937 --> 00:34:55.617]  Here's your present.
[00:34:55.637 --> 00:34:57.359]  Here's what happened with the election.
[00:34:57.379 --> 00:34:59.001]  You're wondering why Kerry rolled over.
[00:34:59.341 --> 00:35:02.224]  You're wondering why Bush was so confident throughout the election.
[00:35:02.524 --> 00:35:03.145]  Here's the truth.
[00:35:03.826 --> 00:35:16.453]  Also, my classic tour de force, 9-11 The Road to Tyranny, the history of government-sponsored terror, the history of Oklahoma City, the history of the police state and what's being set up in the Patriot Act.
[00:35:16.893 --> 00:35:22.576]  It's all in this almost three-hour film on DVD, two and a half hours on VHS.
[00:35:23.736 --> 00:35:26.918]  $24.95 for one copy of the DVD.
[00:35:27.378 --> 00:35:29.179]  Each additional is $5.95 DVD and $9.95 VHS.
[00:35:34.781 --> 00:35:37.323]  We've got a new 9-11-inside job special.
[00:35:37.403 --> 00:35:41.886]  My two 9-11 films, George Humphrey's 9-11 film, Eric Huffman's 9-11 film.
[00:35:43.887 --> 00:35:52.874]  You can get all four of those and Paul Watson's 300-plus page book, Ordered Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and The New World Order for $59.95.
[00:35:53.634 --> 00:35:55.215]  That's a $53 discount.
[00:35:56.096 --> 00:35:57.717]  We've never offered specials like this.
[00:35:57.997 --> 00:36:00.039]  Maybe you already own the book or one of those videos.
[00:36:00.726 --> 00:36:06.328]  Get them, keep the ones you don't have, and then give the other couple that you already got to friends or family.
[00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.090]  Yeah, make copies of my videos.
[00:36:13.071 --> 00:36:14.532]  I mean, you don't even have to buy a bunch of them.
[00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:18.634]  Get them, make copies for non-profit educational purposes and give them to people.
[00:36:19.154 --> 00:36:20.294]  Put them on AXS TV.
[00:36:20.354 --> 00:36:21.975]  It's having a big effect.
[00:36:22.495 --> 00:36:23.856]  It's having a great effect.
[00:36:26.423 --> 00:36:31.207]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping carts.
[00:36:31.867 --> 00:36:32.868]  Look at the different specials.
[00:36:33.269 --> 00:36:34.029]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:34.049 --> 00:36:34.329]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:38.813]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:36:55.658 --> 00:37:00.503]  Frankly, though, we had a lot of people buying several copies of videos asking about specials.
[00:37:01.344 --> 00:37:03.847]  Several copies of the same titles because they wanted to give them as gifts.
[00:37:04.447 --> 00:37:12.696]  And it's nice to give somebody a gift that's the original with the shrink wrap and the color cover and the hard case and the imprint on top of the DVD or the VHS.
[00:37:13.016 --> 00:37:18.782]  That's a nicer stocking stuffer, you know, gift than, you know, just giving somebody a copy.
[00:37:19.505 --> 00:37:20.267]  But I don't care.
[00:37:20.367 --> 00:37:21.590]  Please keep making copies.
[00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:22.371]  That's the way to go.
[00:37:22.933 --> 00:37:24.556]  So please take action on this.
[00:37:24.997 --> 00:37:25.919]  The time is short.
[00:37:25.979 --> 00:37:27.182]  The New World Order knows that.
[00:37:27.583 --> 00:37:29.106]  And we've got to counter what they're doing.
[00:37:30.942 --> 00:37:31.842]  You know, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[00:37:31.862 --> 00:37:44.167]  I'm going to go ahead and go to calls now, and then I'll get into this article you've been holding long enough, this article about our troops and kind of some of the shifting mindsets, some of the embedded British reporters with our soldiers and U.S.
[00:37:44.207 --> 00:37:46.788]  reporters with our soldiers inside Fallujah.
[00:37:47.608 --> 00:37:52.110]  Right now, some riveting combat stuff that was covered.
[00:37:53.171 --> 00:37:56.632]  We'll go ahead and go to your calls now, and I would ask Scott to close his mic.
[00:37:57.324 --> 00:37:57.844]  Thanks, Scott.
[00:37:58.484 --> 00:38:00.625]  Let's go ahead and go to Patrick in Canada.
[00:38:00.665 --> 00:38:01.666]  Patrick, you're on the air.
[00:38:01.706 --> 00:38:02.106]  Go ahead.
[00:38:02.786 --> 00:38:03.506]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[00:38:03.526 --> 00:38:04.187]  How are you today?
[00:38:04.527 --> 00:38:04.767]  Good.
[00:38:04.807 --> 00:38:05.387]  Thanks for calling.
[00:38:05.767 --> 00:38:06.267]  Good, good.
[00:38:06.568 --> 00:38:10.949]  I heard you, I guess it was last Saturday on Coast to Coast AM?
[00:38:11.649 --> 00:38:13.930]  They must re-air that on the station you were listening to.
[00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:14.551]  Right.
[00:38:14.591 --> 00:38:15.831]  Maybe I have the wrong day.
[00:38:15.851 --> 00:38:18.272]  But anyways, I heard you on that particular show.
[00:38:19.152 --> 00:38:22.413]  And I think your research that you've done is excellent.
[00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:23.634]  It's great.
[00:38:25.051 --> 00:38:32.413]  But there was one thing that I was calling about specifically is that I myself do a lot of biblical research.
[00:38:33.073 --> 00:38:33.393]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:34.234 --> 00:38:42.776]  And I don't want to be insulting when I say this, but I know you said that you're a Christian, you believed in God, and da-da-da-da-da.
[00:38:42.856 --> 00:38:49.618]  In my research, we've been just as fooled when it comes to different names in the scripture
[00:38:50.855 --> 00:38:52.436]  As we have been deceived.
[00:38:52.456 --> 00:38:56.798]  No, I know, it's Yahweh or Yeshua, and the translation is Jesus.
[00:38:57.038 --> 00:38:57.839]  No, it's not though.
[00:38:58.719 --> 00:39:00.060]  It goes a lot deeper than that.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:08.004]  If you actually look... Okay, well I know who my God is, and you know, people can all day say, well this name, that name.
[00:39:08.604 --> 00:39:09.825]  God knows who I'm praying to.
[00:39:10.367 --> 00:39:11.348]  Yeah, but here's the thing.
[00:39:11.688 --> 00:39:14.109]  The Crater of Israel was never referred to as a God.
[00:39:14.729 --> 00:39:19.112]  Actually, the scriptures, the Crater forbids you to worship the Crater by the name God.
[00:39:19.152 --> 00:39:20.913]  It's actually a Canaanite Babylonian media portrait.
[00:39:20.933 --> 00:39:25.095]  No, I understand that the term God comes from the Canaanites meaning gods.
[00:39:26.008 --> 00:39:28.271]  Well, all I know, sir, is I've done a lot of research on it.
[00:39:45.018 --> 00:39:47.380]  And the research shows otherwise.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:57.568]  The Creator of Israel says, Exodus 23, verse 13, He says, In all things be circumspect and upright, and make no mention of the names of other Elohim, neither let it be heard by thy mouth.
[00:39:57.968 --> 00:40:00.390]  No, I know the Pharisees, let me just stop you.
[00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:07.956]  I know that all of that stuff was secret, they can't even write the name of the Creator, they can't even say the name.
[00:40:08.396 --> 00:40:13.540]  They stone you, but hold on just a minute, and then they wanted to stone Christ because He was saying the name of the Creator.
[00:40:14.259 --> 00:40:16.441]  So, Christ made a new covenant.
[00:40:16.581 --> 00:40:17.962]  Here, it goes deeper than all this.
[00:40:18.262 --> 00:40:19.863]  Here's the real point, I'll get to something.
[00:40:21.104 --> 00:40:24.366]  The satanic architecture of Washington, D.C., okay?
[00:40:24.546 --> 00:40:24.746]  Yes.
[00:40:24.766 --> 00:40:27.227]  The Obelisk, Capitol Hill, okay?
[00:40:27.247 --> 00:40:27.468]  Yes.
[00:40:27.808 --> 00:40:29.569]  It's all an expression of Jupiter.
[00:40:29.909 --> 00:40:31.870]  When you look at all the different names... Yes, that's true.
[00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.012]  Jupiter, which in the Greek is Zeus.
[00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:35.110]  Right.
[00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:38.973]  When you look at all these different names that they've given us, like A-M-E-N, okay?
[00:40:39.013 --> 00:40:40.254]  People are saying A-M-E-N.
[00:40:40.614 --> 00:40:42.576]  That's the ancient deity from Egypt.
[00:40:42.936 --> 00:40:44.277]  The greater deity from Egypt.
[00:40:44.758 --> 00:40:45.858]  No, that's true.
[00:40:45.959 --> 00:40:49.281]  At the end, you say Amen, and that is... you're right.
[00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:51.503]  That was Jupiter of the Egyptians.
[00:40:51.743 --> 00:40:55.386]  G-O-D is Jupiter of the Canaanites and Babylonians and Phoenicians.
[00:40:55.546 --> 00:40:55.946]  No, I know.
[00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:56.367]  It's true.
[00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:58.048]  Thanks for the call, Patrick.
[00:40:58.508 --> 00:41:07.556]  I mean, I understand that our whole language, that's what 1984 talks about, is how each successive New World Order empire changes the definitions and names.
[00:41:08.797 --> 00:41:13.781]  Of course, it's impossible to even communicate with each other, you know, with the true terms.
[00:41:14.002 --> 00:41:20.427]  But, again, a lot of people get caught up in the names and all of this.
[00:41:22.569 --> 00:41:24.831]  Again, this is not a biblical broadcast.
[00:41:25.747 --> 00:41:34.934]  I simply cover news and information and then make no secret about the fact that I am a follower of the person, the individual, you can call him Yeshua, Jesus.
[00:41:36.715 --> 00:41:37.856]  God knows who we're talking about!
[00:41:39.537 --> 00:41:41.198]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[00:41:41.278 --> 00:41:42.239]  John, you're on the air.
[00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:42.699]  Go ahead.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:43.600]  Hello, Alex.
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.321]  Welcome.
[00:41:45.161 --> 00:41:49.925]  Bill Takeda, I hope this whole dual order business is always going to be the Second Amendment.
[00:41:50.905 --> 00:41:51.145]  I mean,
[00:41:52.105 --> 00:42:00.030]  When I came back from the infantry, when I was an infantryman in Vietnam in 1971, I joined the John Birch Society and seen why we weren't winning in Vietnam.
[00:42:00.991 --> 00:42:04.633]  They've come a long way, but they still keep bumping up against the Second Amendment.
[00:42:04.673 --> 00:42:14.580]  Henry Kissinger openly said, we're not meant to win Vietnam, it was meant to go on for a decade, create division in this country, and make hundreds of billions of dollars for select companies.
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:15.720]  Very true.
[00:42:17.202 --> 00:42:20.866]  The thing that the stone is hard for them to swallow is the Second Amendment.
[00:42:20.886 --> 00:42:29.314]  They've got 90 million people under arms, and it's hard for them to start the rough stuff, throwing people into concentration camps, as long as they've got 90 million people under arms.
[00:42:29.434 --> 00:42:35.420]  That's why they want to incrementally build more and more prisons, arrest people for more and more petty false charges.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.483]  That's how it's going to work instead of just mass arrests.
[00:42:38.963 --> 00:42:40.565]  Unless there's massive disasters.
[00:42:41.472 --> 00:42:43.633]  And the good news is most our troops are good people.
[00:42:43.653 --> 00:42:46.374]  They're not going to go along with mass arrests and internment.
[00:42:46.714 --> 00:42:48.795]  That's why the government openly says foreign troops.
[00:42:49.815 --> 00:42:54.677]  Before they can really start the rough stuff, they've got to get us disarmed.
[00:42:54.697 --> 00:42:57.218]  So far it's been a tough nut for them to crack.
[00:42:57.318 --> 00:43:02.240]  And I don't know what to think of the Congress and the Senate in the last election.
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.661]  I mean, I know the Republicans control it.
[00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:04.521]  The fire is a pro-gun.
[00:43:05.205 --> 00:43:12.977]  But, uh, they said that the reason Bush didn't sign the assault weapons ban last time was Tom DeLay and the pro-gun people in the House and Senate kept it off his desk.
[00:43:13.741 --> 00:43:14.241]  Exactly.
[00:43:14.281 --> 00:43:17.442]  That's why the Feds are racing to put in electronic voting machines.
[00:43:17.823 --> 00:43:21.344]  That way we can't vote out phony conservatives when they don't do the right thing.
[00:43:21.824 --> 00:43:30.627]  Now Bush is supporting Senator Arlen Specter, the man who came up with the magic bullet theory 40 years ago as a staffer with a Kennedy cover-up.
[00:43:31.147 --> 00:43:39.950]  This guy openly is pro-abortion and says he's going to block judges to judge ships federally and at the Supreme Court level if they're not pro-abortion.
[00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:41.811]  And Bush is still supporting him.
[00:43:42.441 --> 00:43:43.581]  How is he on a gun issue?
[00:43:44.381 --> 00:43:45.422]  Is he sold?
[00:43:45.522 --> 00:43:46.642]  Spector's a gun grabber.
[00:43:47.222 --> 00:43:47.522]  Okay.
[00:43:48.602 --> 00:43:50.323]  And Bush is promoting him then, right?
[00:43:50.663 --> 00:43:52.863]  Yeah, Bush said he wanted to sign the Assault Weapons Ban.
[00:43:53.283 --> 00:43:53.483]  Yeah.
[00:43:54.784 --> 00:43:57.044]  Well, like I said, Alex, that's the only thing I believe.
[00:43:57.484 --> 00:44:00.165]  If we have a chance of winning against this, we've got to keep the Second Amendment.
[00:44:00.225 --> 00:44:05.546]  If everybody caves in like they did in Britain, Canada, and Australia, well, the game's over as far as I'm concerned.
[00:44:05.906 --> 00:44:10.727]  Well, three years ago, Josh Sugarman, in the local Austin paper,
[00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:21.817]  openly said that we've got your children in the public schools we will ban guns in another generation and that's where they're doing it.
[00:44:22.217 --> 00:44:25.500]  The children in this country now they're banning toy guns in New York.
[00:44:26.469 --> 00:44:27.870]  Uh, they're banning the symbol of guns.
[00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.672]  A child can't, in an essay, write about guns.
[00:44:30.692 --> 00:44:36.256]  I mean, I used to, they used to say in English class, write a fictional account, a ten-page fictional story.
[00:44:36.276 --> 00:44:41.020]  And it was always one about cowboys or soldiers and, you know, because that's what kids are into.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.662]  And, you know, I would write an article about, um,
[00:44:44.492 --> 00:44:54.940]  A hunting trip where I'd write an article about cowboys and Indians fighting, or I'd write an article about soldiers in World War II taking a hill from the Nazis.
[00:44:56.001 --> 00:45:02.005]  And nowadays you do that, you are instantly arrested, psychiatric care, you name it.
[00:45:02.085 --> 00:45:03.686]  And so see, it's a thought crime.
[00:45:03.706 --> 00:45:05.508]  I'll tell you a real quick story, Alex.
[00:45:05.548 --> 00:45:06.468]  When I grew up in the fifties,
[00:45:07.489 --> 00:45:12.654]  We used to have the Mattel Tommy Guns and the War Toys and the Davy Crockett hunting knives.
[00:45:13.175 --> 00:45:13.915]  We took all that to school.
[00:45:13.935 --> 00:45:14.996]  We used to play with it on the playground.
[00:45:15.016 --> 00:45:15.957]  Nobody said anything about it.
[00:45:16.017 --> 00:45:18.280]  Well, my father is 54 years old.
[00:45:19.601 --> 00:45:22.664]  My father went to a rural but also very populous school.
[00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:32.023]  And they would, he got driven to school in the morning because his mother was a teacher, but sometimes he'd ride to friends' houses in the country on the bus, and it wasn't just him.
[00:45:32.103 --> 00:45:44.967]  He said during dove or quail season or deer season, when he was going to somebody else's ranch for the weekend or something, he would openly carry a .243 Savage, he'd openly carry a shotgun, he'd walk right in with a box of shells,
[00:45:46.027 --> 00:45:48.168]  He'd go hunting with the coaches after school.
[00:45:48.928 --> 00:45:52.789]  They don't pile on a bus with the coaches and drive out somewhere to go hunting with the coaches.
[00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:54.990]  Never an accident, never a problem.
[00:45:55.370 --> 00:46:00.112]  Because let me tell you how I was trained, how my father was trained at a very young age.
[00:46:00.132 --> 00:46:02.032]  And by the way, families get in trouble for this now.
[00:46:02.872 --> 00:46:05.513]  You take your child out, you teach them safety very, very young.
[00:46:05.753 --> 00:46:07.994]  This is how it was done going back to the frontier days.
[00:46:08.661 --> 00:46:12.724]  And that's why when I was 14, I could shoot a squirrel at 200 yards.
[00:46:12.744 --> 00:46:14.705]  This is not an exaggeration, folks, with a .22.
[00:46:14.945 --> 00:46:17.647]  I mean, I was like sharpshooter legend.
[00:46:18.127 --> 00:46:21.930]  Now, because I don't shoot but a few times a year because I'm so busy, you know, I'm lucky.
[00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:26.353]  At 200 yards, I can shoot bullseye with a .308, or used to.
[00:46:26.453 --> 00:46:28.915]  I mean, I could shoot at 1,000 yards bullseye with a .308.
[00:46:30.196 --> 00:46:30.776]  So I've lost
[00:46:31.891 --> 00:46:50.864]  Half my skills, but I mean, you know, going out, training, getting out the .22, loading it, learning everything about it, drilling with it, you know, ten times a year when we go out to the ranch, we drive down from Dallas to, you know, the homestead, going over how to use it, what to do, always point it at the ground, toy guns.
[00:46:51.004 --> 00:46:55.887]  If I ever pointed a toy gun at somebody just a few times, my dad would go, that's it!
[00:46:56.667 --> 00:47:01.149]  And he'd take the toy gun, and he'd take it outside, and he'd break it with a hammer and throw it in the trash.
[00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:03.310]  And he'd go, now you go to bed without dinner.
[00:47:04.491 --> 00:47:06.652]  And you don't get to play with your toy guns for a month.
[00:47:07.713 --> 00:47:08.313]  And you know what?
[00:47:08.373 --> 00:47:09.574]  That only happened a few times.
[00:47:09.774 --> 00:47:12.255]  Now these kids run around pointing the toy guns, the rest of it.
[00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:15.611]  And that's why when America had to go to war, we were unstoppable.
[00:47:15.971 --> 00:47:17.412]  Because we had the sharpshooters.
[00:47:17.612 --> 00:47:19.693]  These Europeans didn't know how to use guns.
[00:47:19.913 --> 00:47:26.015]  You can't hand somebody a gun when they're 18 years old for the German Army and say, now go out and learn how to use it.
[00:47:26.335 --> 00:47:27.855]  That's why our snipers are the best.
[00:47:28.376 --> 00:47:28.756]  Go ahead.
[00:47:28.776 --> 00:47:31.697]  Yeah, but I had the same thought.
[00:47:31.717 --> 00:47:32.397]  I grew up in the country.
[00:47:32.477 --> 00:47:34.078]  We used to take our guns to school.
[00:47:34.098 --> 00:47:37.519]  We used to leave them in the trunk of the car in the parking lot and then we'd go pheasant hunting, deer hunting.
[00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:39.971]  And like I said, it's times of change.
[00:47:39.991 --> 00:47:40.891]  Let me tell you something.
[00:47:40.951 --> 00:47:45.253]  Kids wear a Guns N' Roses t-shirt, a rock and roll t-shirt to school.
[00:47:45.553 --> 00:47:47.654]  The teacher doesn't say anything because it could be a threat.
[00:47:47.914 --> 00:47:49.294]  The SWAT team is called.
[00:47:49.814 --> 00:47:51.615]  Then they bust in and drag the child out.
[00:47:51.655 --> 00:47:52.916]  I mean, this is insanity.
[00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:53.336]  Go ahead.
[00:47:54.456 --> 00:47:56.657]  I'm just saying, you can tell where the times have changed.
[00:47:56.677 --> 00:48:01.719]  Where I grew up in the fifties as a kid, in the early sixties, and what's going on now is just like night and day.
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:16.529]  How many high school juniors and seniors are putting on dinners for charity or dinners for the after-school reading club?
[00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:21.533]  I've seen cases where valedictorians are moving out of home.
[00:48:21.833 --> 00:48:22.914]  It's the last month of school.
[00:48:23.721 --> 00:48:31.925]  And they're about to go to college and they've got their car full of plates and a set of steak knives and knives and spoons.
[00:48:32.385 --> 00:48:35.887]  And the SWAT team comes and criminally charges them and they lose their degree.
[00:48:36.367 --> 00:48:38.688]  Oh, the new state law says we can take your diploma from you now.
[00:48:39.849 --> 00:48:41.169]  That was three or four years ago.
[00:48:41.269 --> 00:48:46.952]  Now, they find people with a package that was a few months ago of Dixie knives and spoons.
[00:48:47.812 --> 00:48:48.653]  It was actually last year.
[00:48:49.424 --> 00:48:49.624]  Yep.
[00:48:49.644 --> 00:48:50.005]  Like I said,
[00:49:17.079 --> 00:49:21.342]  When I was in 3rd or 4th grade, I had a Roy Rogers check and I used to take it to school all the time.
[00:49:21.362 --> 00:49:22.743]  Nobody said anything.
[00:49:22.803 --> 00:49:25.084]  Hey, sir, I'm 30 years old.
[00:49:26.225 --> 00:49:42.556]  And when I was in high school in Dallas, until I was 16 and we moved here to Austin my last two years of high school, we, uh, if you were rude to a teacher or didn't do something or were late to practice or whatever, but it wasn't just the football players, they'd take you in there with a paddle, they'd paddle you,
[00:49:43.551 --> 00:49:53.398]  And, uh, everybody carried pocket knives, and you'd pull your pocket knife out and be picking your fingernails, and the coach would go, you know, for the history teacher, let me see that, that's a nice pocket knife.
[00:49:53.698 --> 00:49:54.959]  I got one of these old-timers.
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:55.980]  Again.
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:00.383]  And, uh, kids would get in fistfights occasionally, and they'd kind of look the other way.
[00:50:00.643 --> 00:50:03.745]  Well, now fistfighting isn't allowed, so the kids just blow each other away.
[00:50:03.985 --> 00:50:06.367]  But if you do fistfight, they charge you with a felony.
[00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.791]  Different times, Alex.
[00:50:09.191 --> 00:50:10.151]  Different times!
[00:50:10.352 --> 00:50:12.613]  We're not allowed to learn how to be men.
[00:50:12.633 --> 00:50:14.314]  We're not allowed to learn how to grow up.
[00:50:15.295 --> 00:50:16.175]  We're a joke!
[00:50:16.356 --> 00:50:17.716]  Our society's a joke!
[00:50:18.217 --> 00:50:20.558]  We're standing in the gateway to hell, as far as I'm concerned.
[00:50:21.439 --> 00:50:22.239]  But that's all I've got, Alex.
[00:50:22.259 --> 00:50:22.680]  I've got to go.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.901]  Hey, I appreciate you joining us.
[00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:25.562]  Good to hear from you.
[00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:30.205]  Danny, or is it David and Danny and others, your calls are up next.
[00:50:30.225 --> 00:50:30.665]  I'm kind of
[00:50:32.481 --> 00:50:37.843]  Not going slow here today, but I'm giving the callers a lot of time and I'm making a lot of comments here, but we got a guest coming up.
[00:50:39.144 --> 00:50:39.644]  A doctor.
[00:50:40.844 --> 00:50:42.465]  Arrested for complaining to the VA.
[00:50:42.485 --> 00:50:48.507]  It just says he kept complaining and that's harassment and he was arrested by Homeland Security along with some other person who was complaining.
[00:50:49.487 --> 00:50:50.868]  So don't complain to the VA.
[00:50:52.568 --> 00:50:53.709]  You better watch yourself.
[00:50:53.729 --> 00:50:56.410]  It's all part of the new freedom.

[00:51:02.432 --> 00:51:09.838]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.098 --> 00:51:14.822]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.062 --> 00:51:20.707]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.947 --> 00:51:21.667]  We're good to go.
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:46.800]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.539 --> 00:52:03.140]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:07.402]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:07.522 --> 00:52:10.424]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:10.484 --> 00:52:17.207]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:17.387 --> 00:52:20.389]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:20.609 --> 00:52:22.990]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:31.014]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:52:31.294 --> 00:52:42.596]  Atmosine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum are extracted.
[00:52:42.736 --> 00:52:49.117]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.962]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk.
[00:54:04.502 --> 00:54:07.404]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.931 --> 00:54:18.092]  All right, my friends.
[00:54:19.774 --> 00:54:23.336]  Danny and Fred and others, your calls are coming up, and I said I'd read this article.
[00:54:25.358 --> 00:54:27.019]  This is the change in mindset.
[00:54:29.016 --> 00:54:33.478]  This is out of the London Telegraph today, up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:46.223]  Tony Harden in Fallujah observes American soldiers on the 1st Infantry Division Task Force avenging their fallen comrades as battle begins.
[00:54:46.823 --> 00:54:55.306]  After seven months in Iraq's Sunni Triangle for many American soldiers, the opportunity to avenge dead friends, obtaining a life was a moment of sheer exhilaration.
[00:54:57.834 --> 00:55:06.803]  As they approached their holding position from where, hours later, they would advance into the city, they picked off insurgents on the rooftops and in windows.
[00:55:09.045 --> 00:55:21.557]  I got myself a real juicy target, shouted Sergeant James Annette, peering through the thermal sight of a long-range acquisition system, or LRAS, mounted on one of the platformed Humvees.
[00:55:22.518 --> 00:55:24.580]  Yeah, that's uh... I've seen that system.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.103]  It's a big old... If this is a system I've seen when they were doing drills here in the U.S.
[00:55:28.163 --> 00:55:35.430]  It's a big old .50 cal mounted up high and they're down in the seat and it's infrared looking around and you fire it from down inside the vehicle.
[00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:36.271]  It's like robotic.
[00:55:36.711 --> 00:55:37.632]  Prepare to copy that.
[00:55:37.652 --> 00:55:37.632]  89089226.
[00:55:37.672 --> 00:55:38.213]  Detection.
[00:55:38.233 --> 00:55:38.533]  202 degrees.
[00:55:38.553 --> 00:55:38.973]  Range 950 meters.
[00:55:38.993 --> 00:55:41.736]  I've got five mother bleepers in a building with weapons.
[00:55:48.556 --> 00:55:54.059]  Captain Kirk Mayfield, commander of the Phantoms, called for fire from the task force mortar team.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.321]  But Sergeant Annette didn't want to wait.
[00:55:57.701 --> 00:55:59.422]  Dude, give me that sniper rifle.
[00:55:59.642 --> 00:56:00.483]  I can take them out.
[00:56:00.543 --> 00:56:01.683]  I'm from Alabama.
[00:56:02.784 --> 00:56:04.105]  Two minutes ticked by.
[00:56:04.385 --> 00:56:06.326]  They're moving deep, shouted Sergeant Annette.
[00:56:06.626 --> 00:56:13.930]  With disappointment, a dozen loud booms rattled the sky and smoke rose as mortars rained down on the coordinates the sergeant had given.
[00:56:14.682 --> 00:56:15.562]  Yeah, he yelled.
[00:56:15.662 --> 00:56:16.763]  Battle damage assessment.
[00:56:17.143 --> 00:56:17.523]  Nothing.
[00:56:17.663 --> 00:56:18.403]  Building's gone.
[00:56:18.964 --> 00:56:19.864]  I got my skills.
[00:56:19.944 --> 00:56:20.704]  I'm coming down.
[00:56:20.804 --> 00:56:22.225]  I just love my job.
[00:56:22.705 --> 00:56:26.467]  Phantom Troop had rolled out of Camp Fallujah, the main U.S.
[00:56:26.507 --> 00:56:28.787]  military base, shortly before 4 a.m.
[00:56:28.927 --> 00:56:29.528]  all morning.
[00:56:29.588 --> 00:56:34.870]  They took fire from Al-Asarki District in Fallujah's northeast.
[00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:37.991]  Their target for the invasion, Probert.
[00:56:38.911 --> 00:56:42.654]  The insurgents, not understanding the capabilities of the L.A.R.S.'
[00:56:42.634 --> 00:56:45.776]  's, crept along rooftops and poked their heads out of windows.
[00:56:46.296 --> 00:56:51.159]  Even when they were more than a mile away, the soldiers of Phantom Troop had their eyes on them.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.381]  Lieutenant Jack Farley, U.S.
[00:56:53.401 --> 00:56:59.005]  Marines officer, sauntered over to compare notes with the Phantoms.
[00:56:59.045 --> 00:57:01.827]  You guys get to do all the fun stuff, he said.
[00:57:02.267 --> 00:57:03.588]  It's like a video game.
[00:57:04.508 --> 00:57:05.249]  And he continues.
[00:57:06.641 --> 00:57:09.042]  We've taken small arms fire here all day.
[00:57:09.122 --> 00:57:11.083]  It just sounds like popcorn going off.
[00:57:11.123 --> 00:57:16.226]  Another Marine stepped forward and began to fire an M4 rifle as the city.
[00:57:17.106 --> 00:57:19.228]  He's a reservist in San Diego Police.
[00:57:19.268 --> 00:57:22.409]  He wants a place and a piece of the action too.
[00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:27.752]  A Phantom Abrams tank moved up the road running along the high ground.
[00:57:27.812 --> 00:57:33.295]  It's a barrel stenciled with the words, Alibaba under three thieves.
[00:57:34.289 --> 00:57:41.477]  And it says, swiveled towards the city and then fired a 120mm round at a house where two men with AK-47s had been pinpointed.
[00:57:42.017 --> 00:57:45.601]  Ain't nobody moving now, shouted the soldier as the dust cleared.
[00:57:45.621 --> 00:57:49.105]  He rocked that guy's world.
[00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:54.911]  Now again, folks, in all our other wars, we've generally faced people with similar weapons.
[00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:56.713]  And, again,
[00:57:58.667 --> 00:58:04.270]  This is what we're going to face domestically here if the Marines can be conditioned to engage the American people.
[00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:06.271]  And I've been there where they're training them to do it.
[00:58:07.812 --> 00:58:16.737]  We're going to be facing hover drones, which they admit they have, with weapons bristling, small, armored, remote-controlled tanks about the size of a Volkswagen.
[00:58:17.677 --> 00:58:24.001]  And the problem with this type of system is that domestically it allows people to not actually see what they're doing up close.
[00:58:25.399 --> 00:58:30.344]  But obviously, it saves Marines' lives and soldiers' lives and the Army.
[00:58:31.304 --> 00:58:44.576]  And these are more precision weapons than the five-day bombardment by heavy artillery and jet bombers, which Rumsfeld called precision, which is a joke.
[00:58:45.437 --> 00:58:46.038]  So interesting.
[00:58:46.158 --> 00:58:49.541]  We'll read more of this later after your calls, and as guests, stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:58:58.084 --> 00:58:58.744]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.384 --> 00:59:00.445]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.165 --> 00:59:02.245]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.905 --> 00:59:03.746]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.486 --> 00:59:05.366]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.386 --> 00:59:09.687]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.247 --> 00:59:14.368]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.449 --> 00:59:19.630]  The battle for Fallujah is raging.
[00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:24.631]  Looks like even from the foreign Arab reports, it's going well for the
[00:59:26.045 --> 00:59:26.385]  U.S.
[00:59:26.625 --> 00:59:31.387]  forces, the coalition of one, that are taking part in this battle.
[00:59:32.308 --> 00:59:33.608]  We'll be covering that later.
[00:59:34.269 --> 00:59:36.450]  Also, Danny, Fred, and others, we're going to get your calls.
[00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:37.850]  We'll take a lot of calls in this hour.
[00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:41.092]  A bunch of news on the plunging dollar and the economy.
[00:59:42.832 --> 00:59:50.656]  But we've got a guest on with us that is, well, a really important issue and story.
[00:59:52.236 --> 01:00:03.178]  You've heard about the woman with the toy store selling knockoff Rubik's Cubes that are admittedly legal, and Homeland Security came and threatened her to take them off her shelves, but the border stays wide open.
[01:00:03.918 --> 01:00:11.819]  You've heard about people in bed rigging for more parking spaces, $4,000 bribes being charged under the Patriot Act, and having their rights stripped.
[01:00:12.559 --> 01:00:15.980]  We have all that posted on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.301]  But this new one was out of the Quad City Times, and it's up on the sites as well,
[01:00:22.646 --> 01:00:24.708]  Agents arrest man in threats.
[01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:40.662]  Inspectors from the Federal Protective Services, a branch of Homeland Security Department, arrested a Beddarford chiropractor Friday accused of making harassing phone calls to the
[01:00:42.822 --> 01:00:47.024]  Defense Department, Department of Veterans Affairs Office in Des Moines.
[01:00:47.465 --> 01:00:49.886]  And we have other examples of these arrests taking place.
[01:00:49.906 --> 01:00:54.329]  I have another article with somebody else on the East Coast complaining being arrested.
[01:00:54.889 --> 01:01:00.752]  He had been harassing them for the past three years, says Calvi.
[01:01:00.872 --> 01:01:05.335]  Calvi is one of these FPS, Homeland Security Officers.
[01:01:06.941 --> 01:01:15.263]  We were looking at the messages and while they were no direct threats, the language was abusive and derogatory and seems to be getting worse.
[01:01:15.283 --> 01:01:21.084]  And they go on to say after 9-11 we gotta take all this serious and we're under Homeland Security.
[01:01:22.264 --> 01:01:29.886]  And so he was arrested in front of his family for this supposed crime of complaining.
[01:01:31.046 --> 01:01:32.026]  And joining us
[01:01:33.506 --> 01:01:41.530]  Here on the air is Kenneth C. Tennant, 45, of Polk County, Iowa.
[01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:43.511]  Kenneth, doctor, good to have you on with us.
[01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:46.692]  Yes, good afternoon.
[01:01:47.252 --> 01:01:49.533]  I'd like to just say I'm not from Polk County.
[01:01:49.853 --> 01:01:52.815]  Polk County is where the Iowa capital is.
[01:01:52.895 --> 01:01:55.596]  I'm from Bettendorf, which is in Scott County.
[01:01:56.388 --> 01:02:03.550]  Okay, well that's just what the newspaper said, so... Okay, just to straighten that out, I'd like to give you a little background on this.
[01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:11.933]  I had served this country, I was in the military, and I received the military's mass vaccination program, which is pretty much at issue.
[01:02:12.613 --> 01:02:21.956]  The fact that a lot of these vaccines were administered in a way contrary to established procedures and safe practices.
[01:02:22.908 --> 01:02:26.089]  I've been complaining about these vaccines for a long time.
[01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:32.072]  If anyone cares to look at the Washington Post, Thursday, October 28th, you see a U.S.
[01:02:32.092 --> 01:02:41.816]  District Court judge, basically Emmett Sullivan, saying that these mandatory vaccination programs, you know, a lot of them, a lot of it is illegal.
[01:02:42.296 --> 01:02:43.177]  They're experimental.
[01:02:43.197 --> 01:02:43.457]  Well, it is.
[01:02:43.477 --> 01:02:47.418]  These are experimental vaccines where you have to get the victim's consent.
[01:02:47.919 --> 01:02:49.479]  Well, the troops, they don't get consent.
[01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:51.240]  They just say, take it to your court-martialed.
[01:02:52.202 --> 01:02:59.629]  That's correct, and it's my understanding some of them have even been imprisoned after returning from their tour of duty in Iraq.
[01:03:00.129 --> 01:03:01.190]  Well, I'll tell you what, doctor.
[01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.071]  We're going to break here.
[01:03:02.091 --> 01:03:02.892]  We're going to come back.
[01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:04.373]  I want to recap what you just said.
[01:03:04.393 --> 01:03:06.715]  Then I want to get into what happened to you last week.
[01:03:07.696 --> 01:03:10.899]  And how you were arrested, you told me this morning, in front of your family.
[01:03:11.219 --> 01:03:13.321]  And the federal officer over all this
[01:03:14.282 --> 01:03:23.527]  admits in the paper you didn't threaten anybody, so now complaining as a veteran to the VA with the admitted horrible things they do gets you arrested.
[01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:26.408]  So when we break, sir, we'll come right back to you, okay?
[01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:27.008]  Okay.
[01:03:27.849 --> 01:03:35.473]  We're talking to Kenneth C. Tennant about how he was arrested by Homeland Security admittedly for complaining.
[01:03:36.293 --> 01:03:37.354]  They just can't allow that.
[01:03:37.394 --> 01:03:38.074]  That's just evil.
[01:03:39.281 --> 01:03:49.387]  And we'll read some more of the quotes by the feds in this article out of the Quad City Times that's on Infowars.com right now.
[01:03:50.207 --> 01:03:50.787]  We'll be back.
[01:03:50.807 --> 01:03:51.968]  Your calls are coming up as well.

[01:03:58.031 --> 01:04:02.494]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.594 --> 01:04:06.996]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.016 --> 01:04:08.337]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.293 --> 01:04:10.936]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.933 --> 01:04:34.320]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.903]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:05:52.734 --> 01:05:55.796]  Dad, that cocoon stuff really got rid of your gray hair!
[01:05:55.976 --> 01:06:02.481]  I'm that 44 year old guy you've heard talking about taking Cocoon GH and how it helped reverse my gray hairs.
[01:06:02.601 --> 01:06:04.423]  And here's some more great news.
[01:06:04.523 --> 01:06:08.025]  Taking Cocoon GH can improve your life in many ways.
[01:06:08.145 --> 01:06:13.529]  Cocoon basically repairs your body to a youthful state you perhaps had 10 or 20 years ago.
[01:06:13.749 --> 01:06:16.311]  I'm taking Cocoon GH and here's what I notice.
[01:06:16.471 --> 01:06:21.715]  After a few sprays in my mouth, I'm in peak condition mentally, emotionally, and physically.
[01:06:21.715 --> 01:06:21.915]  Absolutely.
[01:06:21.975 --> 01:06:24.937]  In the state I get from Cocoon, I feel unstoppable.
[01:06:25.238 --> 01:06:27.059]  And you can have the same feeling.
[01:06:27.319 --> 01:06:37.247]  If you're tired, run down, want to boost your sexual performance, want to help wipe out back pain or arthritis, you need to start taking Cocoon GH right now.
[01:06:37.567 --> 01:06:41.670]  If you want similar results, call now to order Cocoon GH.
[01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:42.611]  Here's the number.
[01:06:42.671 --> 01:06:42.851]  800-814-5031, 800-814-5031, 800-814-5031.
[01:06:42.871 --> 01:06:45.633]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:11.292 --> 01:07:13.913]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live here today.
[01:07:15.273 --> 01:07:19.195]  And we're talking to Dr. Kenneth C. Tennant.
[01:07:19.615 --> 01:07:21.936]  Forty-five, very mild-mannered gentleman.
[01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:27.798]  Very well informed, you just heard him talking about the forced inoculation programs going on in the military.
[01:07:27.838 --> 01:07:29.838]  He's a veteran himself.
[01:07:30.859 --> 01:07:33.299]  And he started complaining to the VA about this.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:40.622]  And the Department of Homeland Security officer in the Quad City Times article admits
[01:07:41.371 --> 01:07:48.697]  That we were looking at the messages and while there were no direct threats, the language was abusive and derogatory and seemed to be getting worse.
[01:07:50.319 --> 01:08:00.427]  Now in my film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, I have the articles where the headline in Wisconsin, Paper Terrorist Convicted.
[01:08:01.268 --> 01:08:05.492]  And they were trying to take the guys 30 acres by a river where they wanted to build something.
[01:08:05.812 --> 01:08:07.974]  They didn't want to pay and he sued the government
[01:08:08.559 --> 01:08:25.159]  And they actually have the State Attorney General in there saying, suing the government is an act of harassment, it's an act of terrorism, and the prosecutor wanted 50 years in prison, the judge said, no that's too much, just 5 years in prison for the veteran, no criminal record, in a wheelchair.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:32.245]  Two weeks ago, the woman selling knock-off Rubik's Cubes in Oregon, in St.
[01:08:32.265 --> 01:08:34.707]  Helen, the tiny town, small toy store.
[01:08:34.927 --> 01:08:36.168]  The toys were not illegal.
[01:08:36.888 --> 01:08:38.529]  The patent was up on Rubik's Cube.
[01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:39.450]  She didn't even make them.
[01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.232]  She bought them from the big distributor.
[01:08:41.792 --> 01:08:47.336]  And they sent Homeland Security to her office and said, we're here to protect the entire economy.
[01:08:47.897 --> 01:08:49.698]  This is terrorism, what you're doing.
[01:08:49.738 --> 01:08:50.299]  Take them off.
[01:08:50.679 --> 01:08:54.482]  No order, no judge's order, no injunction, no nothing.
[01:08:55.419 --> 01:08:56.981]  And later she found out it wasn't even true.
[01:08:57.261 --> 01:08:59.483]  She put them back on the shelf and called them up and told them that.
[01:08:59.503 --> 01:09:00.083]  They've done nothing.
[01:09:00.364 --> 01:09:01.465]  It's all color of law.
[01:09:03.186 --> 01:09:15.717]  And so, starting back over for those that just joined us, Dr. Kenneth Tennant, again lives in Iowa, tell us about yourself, why you got involved calling the VA, and then what happened to you last week?
[01:09:16.558 --> 01:09:20.722]  Okay, well the foundation of my complaints is after being honorably discharged
[01:09:21.843 --> 01:09:29.586]  A civilian doctor diagnosed me with a condition that it took VA medical doctors six years longer to arrive at.
[01:09:29.606 --> 01:09:30.926]  I mean, this is appalling.
[01:09:30.967 --> 01:09:37.669]  And then it took the VA claims process 13 years to finally say, okay, we're going to admit this is service-connected.
[01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:43.451]  However, even though the Board of Veterans Appeals said that and granted my service-connected,
[01:09:46.368 --> 01:09:54.509]  The VA regional office in Des Moines, Iowa, they have told me things like, you will die before we award your benefits.
[01:09:54.689 --> 01:10:00.911]  And in fact, they have, they've, they assigned a zero percent rating for one of the conditions.
[01:10:01.651 --> 01:10:12.092]  And they assigned an effective date for retroactive compensation purposes of the year 2000, which is a decade off the mark for, you know, being service-connected.
[01:10:12.112 --> 01:10:15.213]  Now, I've said things like the VA claims process
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.041]  Lacks objectivity.
[01:10:17.381 --> 01:10:19.983]  They're overly adversarial and abusive to veterans.
[01:10:20.623 --> 01:10:22.204]  Well, everybody knows that.
[01:10:22.244 --> 01:10:30.989]  I mean, the horror stories of people dying in VA beds in four states with maggots crawling up their nasal passage, laying eggs in their brain.
[01:10:31.969 --> 01:10:32.969]  I'm sure you've heard about that.
[01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.909]  Yes, I have.
[01:10:34.170 --> 01:10:44.072]  I mean, it's nightmare after nightmare that we've had different veterans groups on, reading the documents where the fat cats get more money if they deny benefits.
[01:10:44.512 --> 01:10:50.433]  We know they told World War II and Korean War and Vietnam vets, you and your family will all get health care.
[01:10:50.853 --> 01:10:52.774]  Now they're saying we're breaking that contract.
[01:10:53.174 --> 01:10:56.415]  Your family doesn't get it, and by the way, you're not going to get it either.
[01:10:56.855 --> 01:10:58.795]  Well, I'd like to comment along those lines.
[01:10:58.835 --> 01:11:00.916]  There are attorneys that have said
[01:11:02.251 --> 01:11:05.913]  That this is a, quote, government-sponsored criminal activity, unquote.
[01:11:05.933 --> 01:11:08.774]  And that's a letter, November 3rd, 97, to U.S.
[01:11:08.854 --> 01:11:10.274]  Court Judge Barbara Crabb.
[01:11:10.414 --> 01:11:15.696]  And then there's a Des Moines, Iowa, attorney who is currently serving as the assistant attorney general.
[01:11:15.736 --> 01:11:23.479]  And this could be found in the Federal Lawyer, Volume 45, Number 5, under a letter called, entitled, Veterans Benefit Cases Minefield.
[01:11:23.519 --> 01:11:30.042]  He is going on and saying, quote, that this entire veterans benefit system is corrupt and corrupting.
[01:11:30.715 --> 01:11:34.740]  It's institutional arrogance of a system that holds no respect for the law.
[01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:39.567]  And there's... Well, aren't most of the people running the VA foreigners that don't even speak English?
[01:11:40.672 --> 01:11:44.313]  You know, I really couldn't say.
[01:11:44.493 --> 01:11:44.993]  I don't know.
[01:11:45.813 --> 01:11:46.913]  It's possible.
[01:11:47.033 --> 01:11:47.374]  I don't know.
[01:11:47.394 --> 01:11:51.134]  Well, that's what I've been told by a lot of veterans, that the people don't even speak English.
[01:11:51.234 --> 01:11:56.576]  And I'm not attacking people from India or China, but they're used to countries where you don't get any real health care.
[01:11:57.176 --> 01:12:05.238]  And it's like professors at most colleges don't even speak English, and you go pay them $30,000 a year to learn the textbook yourself.
[01:12:05.778 --> 01:12:07.038]  But getting past all that,
[01:12:07.579 --> 01:12:09.202]  How did you complain to them?
[01:12:09.602 --> 01:12:13.189]  They admit here that you did not threaten them, but they call it a threat.
[01:12:13.509 --> 01:12:16.836]  They say complaining endangered the homeland.
[01:12:17.649 --> 01:12:29.675]  They say that the federal agent of Homeland Security said the elevated threat of terrorism, coupled with better understanding of workplace violence, have led the service to make a more proactive approach to dealing with harassment.
[01:12:29.695 --> 01:12:35.018]  So, you're calling the people that are supposed to be giving you your benefits, and now that's harassment.
[01:12:35.058 --> 01:12:35.418]  Go ahead.
[01:12:35.618 --> 01:12:36.079]  Well, yes.
[01:12:36.199 --> 01:12:42.502]  Actually, I had sent some emails, and I did send some letters, you know, complaining to this effect.
[01:12:42.952 --> 01:12:54.605]  The Homeland Security officers that initially contacted me to their credit, they did say that they could give me a Polk County citation without all this.
[01:12:54.885 --> 01:12:55.306]  However,
[01:12:56.099 --> 01:13:06.507]  After contacting a Des Moines attorney who said he would represent me, put me on three-way, called this FPF officer, and asked that all future correspondents go to their office.
[01:13:06.547 --> 01:13:10.030]  It was shortly thereafter that they were banging on my doors, and I asked them.
[01:13:10.050 --> 01:13:11.431]  Okay, let's understand this again.
[01:13:11.451 --> 01:13:12.472]  Headline.
[01:13:12.732 --> 01:13:18.477]  Inspectors from Federal Protective Services, a branch of Homeland Security Department, arrest
[01:13:19.511 --> 01:13:20.132]  Well, I had basically just
[01:13:44.847 --> 01:14:06.063]  You know, complained of the overly adversarial and abusive nature, the posturing that they do at the VA regional offices, which is something that the former Chief Justice Frank Niebecker for the highest court in the Veterans Appeals process had complained of for years, that these VA regional offices refuse to follow the law.
[01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:08.185]  Well, let me give people a case point example.
[01:14:09.406 --> 01:14:11.127]  You're a veteran who was shot in the back.
[01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:12.508]  You've got bad back problems.
[01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:19.516]  I got a friend who works full-time, 60-something years old, Vietnam vet, owns a little construction company.
[01:14:20.157 --> 01:14:31.251]  He goes in, he can hardly walk sometimes from the pain, and they tell him, even though it's in his files that he was shot in the back, and has all these fractured discs, we're not going to give you surgery, we're not going to give you...
[01:14:31.981 --> 01:14:41.986]  Any help get out of here and he started raising his voice and they call these armed goons out to physically grab him and threaten to arrest him for arguing with them.
[01:14:42.026 --> 01:14:43.727]  It's don't you argue with us boy.
[01:14:44.107 --> 01:14:45.808]  Is that the type of stuff you've experienced?
[01:14:46.068 --> 01:14:46.608]  Exactly.
[01:14:46.728 --> 01:14:53.092]  I would highly recommend everybody see Gary Null's Gulf War Syndrome documentary video.
[01:14:53.212 --> 01:14:56.974]  It features former Senate investigator James Tooth.
[01:14:57.014 --> 01:14:59.695]  It tells you that that's how the government has been
[01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:01.071]  I don't know.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.862]  I've been exposed to experimental vaccines, etc.
[01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:44.036]  Injections were given under the guise of training and it was quite questionable how things were done there.
[01:15:44.256 --> 01:15:48.957]  Yeah, I've read about that where you don't just get the round of shots, they don't keep records and do it over and over again.
[01:15:49.157 --> 01:16:03.401]  Well, interestingly enough, when I was in basic training and we initially got shot up with about a dozen of them, one of them, the smallpox vaccine, was clearly contraindicated for health reasons and that's a quote off of our military vaccination certificate.
[01:16:03.971 --> 01:16:07.353]  And again, these are experimental, so they have to get you to sign a waiver form.
[01:16:07.393 --> 01:16:08.854]  They can't make you, but they still do.
[01:16:10.015 --> 01:16:11.936]  We were not informed at all.
[01:16:11.996 --> 01:16:13.557]  We were not given the option.
[01:16:14.517 --> 01:16:15.958]  And by the way, that's a felony.
[01:16:16.018 --> 01:16:18.180]  But now let's talk about Homeland Security.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:19.641]  How did this happen?
[01:16:19.661 --> 01:16:20.681]  Tell us how this went down.
[01:16:21.622 --> 01:16:33.549]  Well, exactly one week after appearing on a local news broadcast where they had came in and asked me as a doctor to comment on the flu clinic
[01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:40.693]  I basically simply told the people not to worry about it.
[01:16:40.713 --> 01:16:48.198]  They can better protect themselves just by maintaining sanitary practices, washing your hands more often, eating a healthy diet, chicken soup, etc.
[01:16:48.218 --> 01:16:48.718]  and all that.
[01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:53.522]  Exactly one week after that, I got a phone call from Homeland Security.
[01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:56.804]  I didn't really know who it was because it was a message that was left on my machine.
[01:16:56.824 --> 01:16:59.726]  So when I returned the phone call, I found out I was being investigated.
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.041]  And they asked to meet with me.
[01:17:02.101 --> 01:17:05.604]  So I met with them the following Monday at the Davenport Library.
[01:17:06.304 --> 01:17:07.885]  And they were nice enough.
[01:17:07.905 --> 01:17:10.407]  Bro, they were looking for some dirt on you.
[01:17:10.527 --> 01:17:11.608]  You had a tape recorder.
[01:17:12.249 --> 01:17:13.029]  Well, exactly.
[01:17:13.069 --> 01:17:18.513]  But the thing is, I mean, these are people that are basically... Folks don't ever meet with these people alone.
[01:17:18.914 --> 01:17:21.396]  Well, they were... I gave them the benefit of the doubt.
[01:17:21.416 --> 01:17:21.896]  No, I understand.
[01:17:22.273 --> 01:17:27.298]  But anyway, there's a lot of decent people in tough positions.
[01:17:27.418 --> 01:17:28.679]  I'm giving them my advice.
[01:17:29.039 --> 01:17:30.681]  Don't go meet with Fez alone.
[01:17:30.921 --> 01:17:34.704]  This is coming down, not from them, but they're just fine.
[01:17:34.864 --> 01:17:36.266]  I understand, sir.
[01:17:36.306 --> 01:17:37.927]  So what ended up happening to you?
[01:17:38.107 --> 01:17:38.388]  Pardon?
[01:17:38.708 --> 01:17:39.589]  What ended up happening to you?
[01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:46.515]  Well, what ended up happening to me was they had said that they were going to basically
[01:17:47.262 --> 01:17:51.445]  Get the Polk County Attorney to issue me a simple misdemeanor charge.
[01:17:51.766 --> 01:17:58.551]  By the way, I need an attorney if you, uh, you know, can help me out there, but I gotta appear November 15th up there.
[01:17:59.431 --> 01:18:03.835]  Anyway, uh, they said that they would hand-deliver me this, uh, citation.
[01:18:03.855 --> 01:18:11.361]  Uh, and then afterwards, what happened was is I contacted an attorney up there in Des Moines, and they said that they would take care of it.
[01:18:11.401 --> 01:18:16.885]  They put me on three-way call with this fella, let him know that they should contact the attorney's office,
[01:18:17.561 --> 01:18:23.847]  And I come to find out later that the attorneys decided that they were not going to represent me, you know, after the fact.
[01:18:24.307 --> 01:18:35.137]  And, uh, you know, they just came banging on my door early one morning and arrested me in front of my six-year-old boy, my eight-year-old girl, and my wife, who was vomiting the next day, even.
[01:18:35.157 --> 01:18:36.939]  I mean, they were just totally upset.
[01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:38.040]  They were terrorized.
[01:18:39.913 --> 01:18:42.474]  And then they admit in the newspaper you didn't threaten anybody.
[01:18:42.494 --> 01:18:43.614]  You called and complained.
[01:18:43.634 --> 01:18:45.495]  Well, you know, yeah.
[01:18:45.515 --> 01:18:45.915]  Stay there.
[01:18:46.275 --> 01:18:46.915]  We got a break.
[01:18:47.335 --> 01:18:47.996]  We'll come back.
[01:18:48.656 --> 01:18:50.977]  Stay with us, folks, and we'll get to your calls, I promise.
[01:18:55.358 --> 01:18:57.139]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.639 --> 01:19:01.060]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.220]  Let's update.
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:06.182]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:19:08.095 --> 01:19:10.555]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:19:11.236 --> 01:19:12.196]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:19:12.216 --> 01:19:14.536]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[01:19:15.056 --> 01:19:15.956]  Today, the U.S.
[01:19:15.996 --> 01:19:18.217]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[01:19:18.617 --> 01:19:20.137]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:19:20.717 --> 01:19:22.698]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[01:19:24.058 --> 01:19:28.919]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:19:29.919 --> 01:19:30.659]  Gold is moving.
[01:19:30.919 --> 01:19:32.079]  Equities are treading water.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.020]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:19:35.655 --> 01:19:37.056]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:19:37.477 --> 01:19:39.198]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:19:39.599 --> 01:19:41.581]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:19:41.981 --> 01:19:44.103]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:19:46.265 --> 01:19:48.427]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[01:19:48.807 --> 01:19:49.108]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.735 --> 01:19:57.017]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:57.057 --> 01:20:01.259]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:01.499 --> 01:20:04.301]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:04.481 --> 01:20:06.882]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:07.082 --> 01:20:15.727]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:15.907 --> 01:20:17.268]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:20:17.448 --> 01:20:21.630]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:22.411]  We're good to go.
[01:20:53.731 --> 01:20:55.471]  By now, you've heard about DirecTV.
[01:20:55.691 --> 01:21:03.613]  You've heard that with DirecTV, you get a better value than cable, a better selection than cable, and access to exclusive programming that you can't get anywhere else.
[01:21:03.814 --> 01:21:06.074]  But for whatever reason, you thought there was a catch.
[01:21:06.334 --> 01:21:07.875]  Maybe even hidden fees.
[01:21:08.135 --> 01:21:09.735]  Well, Expert Satellite can help.

[01:22:23.085 --> 01:22:24.126]  Gold and Silver Coins.
[01:22:24.226 --> 01:22:25.326]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[01:22:25.487 --> 01:22:26.267]  Which are collectible?
[01:22:26.307 --> 01:22:27.047]  Which are bullion?

[01:22:58.672 --> 01:23:04.577]  Alright, your calls, I promise, Danny and Fred and Jim and Johnny and Steve are all coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:04.617 --> 01:23:07.139]  We'll go to Steve first because I hear he disagrees with something.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.303]  And understand, doctor, I'm not trying to preach at you.
[01:23:11.343 --> 01:23:13.204]  You're a very informed person.
[01:23:13.224 --> 01:23:14.605]  Everything you've said is checked out.
[01:23:15.206 --> 01:23:17.568]  They admit in the newspaper that you didn't do anything.
[01:23:17.588 --> 01:23:18.388]  You didn't threaten them.
[01:23:19.109 --> 01:23:22.732]  And when I tell you, when I tell the listeners, do not go meet with feds,
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:30.444]  I mean, if they tell you they're doing an investigation about something else and, you know, you were a neighbor or something, and they want to know something, fine.
[01:23:30.484 --> 01:23:33.506]  But, you know, have them meet and have your wife or your neighbor there, too.
[01:23:34.167 --> 01:23:44.473]  Don't ever go alone, because I'm not saying they're all criminals, but a large percentage of them just think it's normal to make stuff up about you, and they'll sleep quite well watching you go to prison.
[01:23:45.594 --> 01:23:49.737]  But these guys do sound more honest, but a little bit nuts.
[01:23:50.838 --> 01:23:54.521]  In that they admit you didn't threaten anybody, but still they came and arrested you.
[01:23:55.382 --> 01:23:59.845]  Calling an agency that's charged to take care of you as a veteran and complaining to them.
[01:24:00.526 --> 01:24:06.030]  They say that complaining constitutes harassment and thus some form of terrorism.
[01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:07.411]  They say terrorism right here.
[01:24:08.012 --> 01:24:10.114]  And that's Section 802 of the Patriot Act.
[01:24:10.294 --> 01:24:14.277]  Every misdemeanor or the suspicion of a misdemeanor is terrorism.
[01:24:15.058 --> 01:24:17.739]  I guess I need an attorney and I really can't afford one.
[01:24:34.548 --> 01:24:34.988]  Exactly.
[01:24:35.028 --> 01:24:38.952]  What you need is some good patriots there locally that know the law.
[01:24:39.012 --> 01:24:42.975]  These pro se litigants keep winning more often than even lawyers do.
[01:24:43.396 --> 01:24:47.259]  We'll give your number out at the end if you'd like to, but we're about to go to break here and we're going to go to calls.
[01:24:47.479 --> 01:24:52.544]  Just tell us about the arrest for, this is in the paper, calling the VA.
[01:24:52.624 --> 01:24:56.467]  Not threatening, but calling and complaining is now an act of terrorism.
[01:24:56.948 --> 01:24:57.748]  It says it right here.
[01:24:58.449 --> 01:24:59.330]  Describe what happened.
[01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:00.331]  Well, again, these
[01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.304]  The specific agent that I was speaking with.
[01:25:04.324 --> 01:25:05.164]  Well, tell us what you were doing.
[01:25:05.184 --> 01:25:05.664]  You were in bed?
[01:25:05.685 --> 01:25:06.545]  You were drinking coffee?
[01:25:06.565 --> 01:25:07.286]  What happened?
[01:25:07.406 --> 01:25:08.186]  I was in bed.
[01:25:08.226 --> 01:25:08.927]  I was talking.
[01:25:09.207 --> 01:25:10.608]  The phone had rang.
[01:25:11.168 --> 01:25:18.694]  Next thing you know, my wife tells me that the police are here and I had to get up and get dressed.
[01:25:20.335 --> 01:25:21.436]  I went and answered the door.
[01:25:21.476 --> 01:25:22.717]  They were pounding on the door.
[01:25:22.797 --> 01:25:24.298]  They had surrounded the house.
[01:25:25.410 --> 01:25:26.031]  How many of them?
[01:25:26.431 --> 01:25:48.768]  Well, there was two local police officers, and there was two, uh, FPS officers, and like I had said before, the officer that I had contacted, that I had spoken with before, he did say that he would, that this was unnecessary, that, you know, he could have just gave me the citation impersonally for me to appear at a later date.
[01:25:49.713 --> 01:25:55.215]  However... But because you reserved your right to counsel in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, you're somehow evil.
[01:25:55.655 --> 01:26:00.157]  Well, yeah, I guess I didn't know that our Constitution had been suspended.
[01:26:00.237 --> 01:26:09.621]  I haven't read the Patriot Act, I don't know what it says, and our congressmen that I've contacted regarding this, they have not... So you go to the door, what happens next?
[01:26:09.661 --> 01:26:18.384]  Well, they asked me to step outside, and I stepped outside, and you know, my kids are looking and watching, my wife is there of course,
[01:26:20.948 --> 01:26:26.549]  One police officer was holding my storm door shut so nobody could come out if my kids were going to push past.
[01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:28.650]  I mean, it was like a 300-pound office.
[01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:36.651]  Anyway, I was told to just bend over and put my hands up on my head.
[01:26:36.971 --> 01:26:38.812]  Nice thing for your neighbors to see.
[01:26:38.912 --> 01:26:44.253]  Yeah, and I live in a neighborhood where the local police live here.
[01:26:45.689 --> 01:26:51.215]  They're nice people, but you know, they see this happening and they start to be suspect.
[01:26:51.235 --> 01:26:52.517]  You know, they're suspicious.
[01:26:52.877 --> 01:26:53.818]  You know, what's going on?
[01:26:53.838 --> 01:26:59.265]  You know, whether there's smoke... And again, the head federal officer of Homeland Security in that area says...
[01:27:00.859 --> 01:27:07.044]  We were looking at the messages, and while they were no direct threats, the language was abusive and derogatory and seemed to be getting worse.
[01:27:07.104 --> 01:27:11.828]  So, to see now that they don't want... I mean, how many bureaucrats have been rude to you folks?
[01:27:11.848 --> 01:27:12.649]  Did they get arrested?
[01:27:13.029 --> 01:27:14.730]  And by the way, had you even been rude, sir?
[01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:15.991]  You seem overly nice.
[01:27:16.872 --> 01:27:18.193]  Well, thank you.
[01:27:18.393 --> 01:27:24.278]  You know, just recently it's been broadcast about the Canal Street brothel.
[01:27:24.298 --> 01:27:25.639]  We're down in Louisiana.
[01:27:26.452 --> 01:27:36.661]  Before, during, and after 9-1-1, you know, our local, well, the FBI had been, they had made like 5,000 illegal wire taps to this brothel.
[01:27:36.941 --> 01:27:38.323]  And they came up empty.
[01:27:38.463 --> 01:27:39.644]  I mean, it was prostitution.
[01:27:39.724 --> 01:27:49.492]  And they ultimately had let it go because they couldn't call their superiors in because they had, you know, patronized the brothel.
[01:27:49.873 --> 01:27:51.254]  So, you know, they had nothing.
[01:27:52.961 --> 01:27:58.164]  So your point is they're busy doing stuff like this with you, but then they don't have time to deal with real things.
[01:27:58.584 --> 01:28:00.865]  Well, I understand that their job is difficult.
[01:28:01.145 --> 01:28:02.386]  It is a difficult job.
[01:28:02.426 --> 01:28:03.887]  They're between a rock and a hard place.
[01:28:03.907 --> 01:28:08.449]  You know, I'm so tired of women that are raped and people that are abused making excuses for the abusers.
[01:28:08.769 --> 01:28:19.455]  But the top officials in the VA and the medical, the pharmaceutical, the corporate drug companies are the ones that are behind us.
[01:28:19.495 --> 01:28:22.376]  They don't want me telling people about vaccines.
[01:28:22.396 --> 01:28:30.641]  And by the way, your listeners can go to mothering.com and pull up number 105 to read about the ingredients in vaccines, even for their children.
[01:28:31.321 --> 01:28:33.102]  Now, my listeners are very well informed, Doctor.
[01:28:33.162 --> 01:28:34.343]  Let's come back and take some calls.
[01:28:34.363 --> 01:28:34.703]  I want to hear
[01:28:35.382 --> 01:28:39.503]  Just in a few minutes about how the arrest went, what they said to you in the car.
[01:28:40.444 --> 01:28:41.484]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:28:41.524 --> 01:28:42.884]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:42.904 --> 01:28:43.245]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.285 --> 01:28:44.945]  Your calls for... We're on the march.
[01:28:45.405 --> 01:28:47.046]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.926 --> 01:28:50.587]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.746 --> 01:28:58.851]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[01:28:59.151 --> 01:29:01.253]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[01:29:01.273 --> 01:29:06.417]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[01:29:06.717 --> 01:29:08.099]  It actually works.
[01:29:08.499 --> 01:29:11.902]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[01:29:11.962 --> 01:29:13.483]  I've tried many, many products.
[01:29:13.644 --> 01:29:15.805]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenate.
[01:29:16.266 --> 01:29:19.609]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[01:29:20.282 --> 01:29:20.903]  It truly works.
[01:29:21.283 --> 01:29:22.485]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[01:29:22.865 --> 01:29:28.611]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:29:28.671 --> 01:29:34.498]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[01:29:34.638 --> 01:29:37.221]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[01:29:37.561 --> 01:29:38.622]  It's healthy for you, too.
[01:29:38.802 --> 01:29:39.822]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[01:29:39.842 --> 01:29:40.082]  1-800-622-FIN.
[01:29:40.142 --> 01:29:40.362]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:29:40.422 --> 01:29:41.683]  Get $25 off a 3-month supply of collagenate.
[01:29:41.703 --> 01:29:42.203]  So call now.
[01:29:42.223 --> 01:29:42.363]  1-800-622-FIN.
[01:29:42.383 --> 01:29:42.583]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[01:29:54.128 --> 01:29:59.372]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:59.512 --> 01:30:07.598]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:07.858 --> 01:30:14.903]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:15.083 --> 01:30:16.364]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:22.349]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:22.529 --> 01:30:27.633]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:27.733 --> 01:30:36.621]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:30:36.881 --> 01:30:40.183]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:30:53.691 --> 01:30:57.413]  You've heard about PODS from Bio-Ox International and it's bubble-up technology.
[01:30:57.694 --> 01:31:01.976]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?

[01:31:16.486 --> 01:31:19.948]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.

[01:31:39.198 --> 01:31:43.861]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[01:31:44.061 --> 01:31:46.602]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[01:31:46.742 --> 01:31:51.404]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use Bio-Ox family of products.
[01:31:54.679 --> 01:31:57.440]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:01.282]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:03.223 --> 01:32:11.006]  We're talking to Dr. Kenneth C. Tennant, 45, Gulf War-era veteran in Iowa.
[01:32:12.786 --> 01:32:15.468]  And what did Dr. Tennant do wrong?
[01:32:15.688 --> 01:32:23.711]  They admit here in the Quad City Times, they have the Homeland Security officer here, openly saying
[01:32:24.528 --> 01:32:35.596]  Will Calvey saying that, quote, we were looking at the messages and while there were no direct threats, the language was abusive and derogatory and seemed to be getting worse.
[01:32:36.677 --> 01:32:52.568]  And then they admit here that he's been involved in the community, he sued the VA over the forced inoculations of experimental vaccines, it's a felony to force somebody to take one of these federal judges, and it's ruled repeatedly just about a month ago again that you cannot do this, but they say, we don't care, we're going to continue it.
[01:32:54.025 --> 01:32:57.947]  And so he emails, he calls, he complains, and they say, we're going to have you arrested.
[01:32:58.787 --> 01:33:04.230]  And he believes it's because he's been involved on local radio and other places speaking out against the flu shots.
[01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:08.392]  I mean, Bill Maher on his new HBO show says don't take them.
[01:33:08.432 --> 01:33:11.973]  Even Bush in a speech said, you don't need them unless you're old, young, or infirm.
[01:33:12.733 --> 01:33:16.855]  And then they're even questionable if they're safe, full of the thimerosal the Associated Press reported.
[01:33:17.155 --> 01:33:20.477]  They've actually increased the level of mercury in these shots, which is admittedly dangerous.
[01:33:21.705 --> 01:33:29.250]  So all of this is going on, and so they come to his house, they pull him outside in the morning with these two Homeland Security guys and two regular cops, local cops.
[01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:30.711]  They handcuff you.
[01:33:30.791 --> 01:33:32.352]  What do they say to you at that point?
[01:33:32.732 --> 01:33:34.814]  What do they say when you're in the police car?
[01:33:34.854 --> 01:33:35.574]  What happened next?
[01:33:36.335 --> 01:33:48.523]  Well, they just told me that if I was quiet and cooperative, they would reposition the cops from being tightly behind my back to in the front, and they did.
[01:33:49.358 --> 01:33:53.081]  And then they offered to get me something to eat, and they did.
[01:33:53.701 --> 01:33:56.443]  Now, are these the local cops or the feds?
[01:33:56.603 --> 01:33:59.125]  No, these are the Homeland Security Federal.
[01:33:59.145 --> 01:34:00.686]  So they're obviously feeling guilty.
[01:34:00.706 --> 01:34:06.691]  And again, I said they're honest in the paper and so they didn't threaten anybody, but he was arrested for threats.
[01:34:06.731 --> 01:34:08.752]  Yeah, I don't want to demonize these guys.
[01:34:08.832 --> 01:34:10.753]  I mean, they seem like they're decent human beings.
[01:34:10.773 --> 01:34:12.395]  But that shows how bad this is.
[01:34:12.435 --> 01:34:15.337]  That's why I said they're not liars, they're nuts.
[01:34:15.657 --> 01:34:15.917]  Yeah.
[01:34:15.937 --> 01:34:18.119]  But they should not follow this illegal order.
[01:34:18.259 --> 01:34:26.305]  Well, they have families they gotta feed, they got a job that they gotta do and they have to follow orders or, you know, they're gonna be in the food lines too.
[01:34:26.485 --> 01:34:28.327]  Yeah, what happened in Nuremberg though?
[01:34:28.847 --> 01:34:30.468]  So they go put you in the car?
[01:34:30.969 --> 01:34:32.190]  It's the same situation.
[01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:36.053]  So along, you know, basically it was pretty quiet.
[01:34:36.153 --> 01:34:41.837]  But, I mean, to their credit, you know, I wasn't just talking at all with them.
[01:34:42.284 --> 01:34:55.192]  But I mean, they were talking between themselves, and some of the language that they used in speaking of their superiors were, idiots, and this is bullshit, and uh... Sir, sir, we cannot use any profanity on the air, okay?
[01:34:55.212 --> 01:34:56.432]  We're going to have to let you go.
[01:34:56.452 --> 01:34:56.633]  Alright?
[01:34:57.253 --> 01:34:59.354]  You cannot talk like that on the air, doctor.
[01:35:00.135 --> 01:35:00.435]  Okay?
[01:35:00.515 --> 01:35:02.036]  That's... Yeah, that was... Okay, fine.
[01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:03.036]  I know, I know.
[01:35:03.417 --> 01:35:09.900]  I know, even on, even on NPR now, if it's a documentary, and what's happening here at five o'clock in the afternoon doing that, but we don't do that here.
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:10.261]  Listen.
[01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:14.632]  So, they were openly saying this was garbage.
[01:35:15.372 --> 01:35:15.572]  Yes.
[01:35:15.992 --> 01:35:22.536]  So, that is extremely, extremely positive that they were there saying that this was garbage.
[01:35:24.657 --> 01:35:32.762]  They were speaking of not specifically... I mean, that's just some of the language that they used between themselves along the way.
[01:35:32.782 --> 01:35:35.123]  I was not talking to them.
[01:35:35.583 --> 01:35:36.944]  Okay, so they didn't like it.
[01:35:36.984 --> 01:35:38.025]  How long were you in jail?
[01:35:39.545 --> 01:35:40.226]  Several hours.
[01:35:41.573 --> 01:35:48.556]  My wife posted a bond of $3.25 and I was released approximately 11pm that evening.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.982]  We're arrested for making harassing phone calls.
[01:36:01.022 --> 01:36:03.184]  They don't say specifically what you were charged with.
[01:36:03.464 --> 01:36:04.465]  What were you charged with?
[01:36:04.685 --> 01:36:10.850]  Well, I haven't been formally charged and I have no idea what the particulars are because no one's telling me anything.
[01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:13.192]  Wait a minute, they arrested you and took you to jail?
[01:36:13.452 --> 01:36:13.812]  Yes.
[01:36:14.133 --> 01:36:15.794]  But didn't tell you what you were charged with?
[01:36:17.135 --> 01:36:18.396]  Sounds like Homeland Security to me.
[01:36:19.277 --> 01:36:21.298]  Now, did they have you sign any paperwork?
[01:36:21.318 --> 01:36:23.760]  Did you sign a personal recognitions bond?
[01:36:24.121 --> 01:36:24.901]  No, I did not.
[01:36:24.961 --> 01:36:25.462]  My wife
[01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:27.851]  Posted cash.
[01:36:27.871 --> 01:36:27.851]  $325.
[01:36:28.011 --> 01:36:38.919]  All I was given at one point in time when I met with him at the library was an Iowa Code 2001 Section 708.7 harassment.
[01:36:38.979 --> 01:36:40.380]  He underlined the word annoyed.
[01:36:41.021 --> 01:36:48.466]  They at that time said that we feel that Polk County Attorney can write up a citation for harassment, simple misdemeanor.
[01:36:49.048 --> 01:36:56.232]  But the particulars of the case, the evidence, the potential witnesses, none of that has been divulged to me, and I've been told that I can't get it.
[01:36:57.613 --> 01:37:00.214]  So I basically cannot prepare a defense.
[01:37:00.254 --> 01:37:01.235]  I have no attorney.
[01:37:02.275 --> 01:37:06.318]  And, you know, it's kind of a stressful situation for my whole family.
[01:37:06.358 --> 01:37:11.461]  We've been thoroughly humiliated, embarrassed, you know, terrorized.
[01:37:13.373 --> 01:37:15.515]  You know, it's not a good situation.
[01:37:15.535 --> 01:37:18.418]  I mean, physically, it can cause people to be sick.
[01:37:18.498 --> 01:37:27.868]  I mean, my kids... So, you're sitting here, and you have been arrested, but they didn't charge you when you were bonded out?
[01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.009]  What did you bond out for?
[01:37:31.802 --> 01:37:37.346]  Well, again, the best I can tell it's a simple third-degree misdemeanor harassment.
[01:37:37.546 --> 01:37:42.370]  But they should have told you that and issued the summons after you were bonded out.
[01:37:42.450 --> 01:37:47.033]  Yeah, I won't get that until I appear on November 15th.
[01:37:47.133 --> 01:37:53.198]  And by the way, what was that Patriot Act section you had noted about?
[01:37:53.318 --> 01:37:53.778]  It's H.R.
[01:37:53.798 --> 01:37:55.980]  3162 is the bill number passed October 27, 2001.
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:55.980]  3162?
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:56.560]  It is the bill.
[01:38:01.198 --> 01:38:01.938]  How are you guys doing?
[01:38:01.958 --> 01:38:05.220]  Hey, I just wanted to tell Kenneth I'm a disabled veteran, also Ken.
[01:38:29.111 --> 01:38:31.556]  And I've been going through some of the same things you did.
[01:38:31.596 --> 01:38:33.799]  I broke my back in three places at the Marine Corps.
[01:38:34.521 --> 01:38:38.628]  And the VA tells me that I'm born that way, even though all my medical records say.
[01:38:39.443 --> 01:38:44.906]  And I also found out... Well that's like my friend here in town, shot in the back in Vietnam, a family, hard working, owns a little company.
[01:38:45.826 --> 01:38:47.347]  He doesn't have a bunch of insurance though.
[01:38:47.367 --> 01:38:49.168]  You know, middle class, lower middle class.
[01:38:49.528 --> 01:38:52.930]  And he's in the records, he was shot in the back and they won't help him!
[01:38:53.390 --> 01:39:00.293]  Yeah, and I also found out that I have cancer in my hip after they lied to me for years saying, oh you're born that way, there's nothing wrong.
[01:39:01.334 --> 01:39:07.397]  So what I did, I got all my medical records from them under the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act.
[01:39:08.038 --> 01:39:13.321]  And that Iowa Clinic should have a transcript of every time you've been there and every time you've called.
[01:39:13.841 --> 01:39:18.524]  And you need to get that, and you will catch them in lie after lie after lie.
[01:39:19.184 --> 01:39:22.807]  And the ones you catch lying to, you need to go take out arrest warrants for them.
[01:39:23.327 --> 01:39:34.433]  I mean, these people... Well, the Homeland Security going out to arrest somebody and the police said it was garbage, you know, that it was just ridiculous,
[01:39:36.315 --> 01:39:40.459]  Again, they still shouldn't... Police need to stop following illegal orders!
[01:39:40.999 --> 01:39:43.801]  Yeah, it's just... Hitler's goons is basically what it is.
[01:39:43.881 --> 01:39:51.087]  I mean, that's what this country's come to, is let's go harass disabled veterans because they're treated like trash from the VA.
[01:39:51.668 --> 01:39:53.229]  I mean, the VA is just horrible.
[01:39:53.309 --> 01:39:57.833]  I interviewed about a hundred veterans, because I was taking my case to one of my senators.
[01:39:58.553 --> 01:40:03.057]  Over a hundred veterans told me that the same VA clinic had told them that
[01:40:03.582 --> 01:40:04.923]  Oh, you were born that way.
[01:40:04.943 --> 01:40:06.623]  You never got hurt in the military.
[01:40:06.643 --> 01:40:07.124]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:40:07.144 --> 01:40:07.844]  We've interviewed vets.
[01:40:07.884 --> 01:40:09.605]  We've read mainstream news articles.
[01:40:10.025 --> 01:40:11.165]  I know vets personally.
[01:40:11.546 --> 01:40:12.806]  They won't even examine you.
[01:40:12.826 --> 01:40:14.267]  They just go, oh, here's some Prozac.
[01:40:14.307 --> 01:40:14.847]  You're crazy.
[01:40:14.867 --> 01:40:16.668]  Yeah, that's what they do to me.
[01:40:17.148 --> 01:40:19.189]  When I got my medical records, they kept saying,
[01:40:19.764 --> 01:40:25.188]  Well, he's got Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and he has a history of being angry with the VA.
[01:40:25.388 --> 01:40:25.909]  Exactly.
[01:40:25.929 --> 01:40:27.170]  They're trying to discredit.
[01:40:27.850 --> 01:40:32.834]  Again, if you look at the Gary Null's documentary, Biddy Golf Course Center, that's their MO.
[01:40:32.854 --> 01:40:36.997]  They try to discredit every veteran that knows anything by doing that.
[01:40:37.017 --> 01:40:38.078]  That's a crime.
[01:40:38.138 --> 01:40:44.763]  I've got a letter by the former director of the VA, the regional office in Des Moines, where he outright
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:51.145]  Lies and says that I was not going to be accepted into the school that, ultimately, I graduated from.
[01:40:52.286 --> 01:40:56.950]  This is the kind of blatant disregard for the truth that we have to endure.
[01:40:58.112 --> 01:41:02.315]  In my case, it's been 13 years or better, and it's just an atrocity.
[01:41:02.976 --> 01:41:04.477]  Alright, thanks for the call, Danny.
[01:41:04.877 --> 01:41:05.458]  I've got to move on.
[01:41:05.478 --> 01:41:06.539]  I've got loaded phone lines here.
[01:41:06.619 --> 01:41:07.720]  Fred in Pennsylvania.
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:08.681]  Fred, go ahead.
[01:41:08.701 --> 01:41:11.583]  Hi, I wanted to say that
[01:41:12.748 --> 01:41:19.455]  You have a situation, apparently, where you're afraid about your deteriorating health, right?
[01:41:19.675 --> 01:41:19.935]  Yes.
[01:41:23.919 --> 01:41:26.241]  What kind of local resources do you have?
[01:41:26.261 --> 01:41:29.925]  Do you have a lawyer referral service up in that city?
[01:41:30.606 --> 01:41:34.029]  I've found them to be totally empty.
[01:41:35.269 --> 01:41:46.575]  I've never been able to find, I mean, we've got everything that anyone's got, but when you call the, you know, all these lawyer referral services, you can't really find anybody.
[01:41:47.015 --> 01:41:47.416]  I can't.
[01:41:48.016 --> 01:41:49.757]  Well, they're going to sell a bunch of money out of you.
[01:41:49.777 --> 01:41:57.361]  Look, you go into court, and you hold up the news article as Exhibit A, and you go, the Chief Federal Officer on this case says I did not threaten anybody.
[01:41:58.762 --> 01:42:01.323]  Am I allowed to call the VA?
[01:42:01.443 --> 01:42:01.663]  Yes.
[01:42:01.703 --> 01:42:02.784]  Are they there to serve me?
[01:42:02.844 --> 01:42:03.124]  Yes.
[01:42:04.554 --> 01:42:05.435]  Well, they're not.
[01:42:05.495 --> 01:42:10.679]  The VA is going to step back and let the local county prosecutor... No, I know, sir.
[01:42:10.719 --> 01:42:12.181]  You show that no one was harmed.
[01:42:12.221 --> 01:42:13.282]  No crime has been committed.
[01:42:13.622 --> 01:42:15.003]  Well, I don't feel that at all.
[01:42:15.223 --> 01:42:20.588]  The chief federal officer says you didn't threaten anybody, but they were still arrested you.
[01:42:21.624 --> 01:42:26.466]  Yeah, that's, I feel that that's, uh, you know, in the French meant to say the least.
[01:42:26.506 --> 01:42:30.647]  Look, you put him on the stand, you go, did you tell the Quad City Times this?
[01:42:30.727 --> 01:42:34.589]  And if he says no, you call in the Quad City Times reporter and go, did he tell you that?
[01:42:35.069 --> 01:42:35.749]  Uh, yes he did.
[01:42:35.769 --> 01:42:38.510]  Hey, thanks, uh, Jim, anything else?
[01:42:38.951 --> 01:42:40.011]  Or Fred, go ahead.
[01:42:40.051 --> 01:42:45.053]  Yeah, I think you might have a point of attack in the arrest warrant, it might not even
[01:42:45.635 --> 01:42:47.477]  I've been one when you're actually arrested.
[01:42:47.537 --> 01:42:48.037]  There wasn't.
[01:42:48.437 --> 01:42:49.078]  I didn't mean it.
[01:42:49.298 --> 01:42:54.862]  Well, then you can void the charges if you were actually arrested legally.
[01:42:55.183 --> 01:42:56.424]  Okay, Fred, thanks for the call.
[01:42:56.524 --> 01:42:58.946]  Yeah, they do this a lot where there's nothing even on the record.
[01:42:58.966 --> 01:42:59.826]  It's just harassment.
[01:43:00.247 --> 01:43:08.253]  And again, the big story here, why is Homeland Security visiting toy stores, county commissioners, small-time pot dealers?
[01:43:09.666 --> 01:43:13.267]  Doctors, veterans who call the VA.
[01:43:13.747 --> 01:43:14.687]  Why is this happening?
[01:43:15.008 --> 01:43:15.848]  Steve in Texas.
[01:43:15.888 --> 01:43:16.548]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:43:16.568 --> 01:43:17.128]  You're on the air.
[01:43:19.449 --> 01:43:20.749]  I apologize to both of you.
[01:43:20.789 --> 01:43:24.230]  I've got something to speak about that has absolutely nothing to do with this.
[01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:24.350]  Oh, no.
[01:43:24.370 --> 01:43:25.830]  You say you disagree with me, so go ahead.
[01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.630]  Yes.
[01:43:28.211 --> 01:43:31.972]  Alex, I'm trying to be a part of the solution here, not a part of the problem.
[01:43:32.012 --> 01:43:37.633]  But a problem that I'm coming to, a problem that I'm finding is that
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:49.423]  When I tell people to listen to the local radio station here that carries your broadcast and other broadcasts, when they hear how you badger people, it slams the door shut.
[01:43:50.144 --> 01:43:58.806]  You're impeaching yourself and you're impeaching me, because after hearing how you badger people, nobody wants to listen anymore.
[01:43:58.826 --> 01:43:59.706]  It puts them back to sleep.
[01:44:00.407 --> 01:44:07.129]  Concerning the gentleman that called earlier, who had been doing biblical research, I believe he was calling out of Canada.
[01:44:09.027 --> 01:44:14.131]  I am new to the Patriot community and also new to the Christian community.
[01:44:14.652 --> 01:44:16.593]  This man was giving information that I need.
[01:44:17.694 --> 01:44:18.755]  You say that you're a Christian.
[01:44:19.115 --> 01:44:22.558]  That would say that you might place more importance on your eternal soul.
[01:44:22.618 --> 01:44:24.539]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:44:24.639 --> 01:44:28.943]  Would it be badgering if I was able to respond to the first thing you said and then the second?
[01:44:29.583 --> 01:44:29.883]  Certainly.
[01:44:30.444 --> 01:44:30.844]  No, no, no.
[01:44:31.004 --> 01:44:31.745]  It wouldn't be badgering.
[01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:32.265]  Go ahead.
[01:44:32.325 --> 01:44:32.986]  May I talk then?
[01:44:33.566 --> 01:44:34.067]  Absolutely.
[01:44:34.127 --> 01:44:34.627]  It's your show.
[01:44:34.647 --> 01:44:35.728]  You have the power of the office.
[01:44:35.768 --> 01:44:36.048]  Okay.
[01:44:36.088 --> 01:44:38.290]  I don't have any... Let me just say something to you.
[01:44:38.954 --> 01:44:41.815]  How was I able to just now go to your call, Steve?
[01:44:43.515 --> 01:44:50.237]  I was able to go to your call because I let Danny say three or four things, and then let the guest comment, and let Danny have another response.
[01:44:50.658 --> 01:44:55.059]  Then I let Fred say two things, then have the guest have a response, and then Fred finished.
[01:44:55.794 --> 01:44:57.235]  And then I went to you, Steve.
[01:44:57.695 --> 01:45:00.257]  And so I have to go to the next caller.
[01:45:00.277 --> 01:45:01.718]  In fact, I've actually timed this out.
[01:45:02.258 --> 01:45:07.362]  We give callers more time, about three times more time than most mainstream radio shows.
[01:45:08.082 --> 01:45:08.903]  I do jump in.
[01:45:09.003 --> 01:45:09.664]  I do interrupt.
[01:45:09.764 --> 01:45:10.824]  I do add points.
[01:45:12.045 --> 01:45:12.906]  And that's what I do.
[01:45:13.026 --> 01:45:17.509]  And I have the number one patriot radio show in the country.
[01:45:18.409 --> 01:45:19.890]  Because I don't script things.
[01:45:20.071 --> 01:45:21.472]  I wear my heart on my sleeve.
[01:45:22.472 --> 01:45:23.593]  I tell you what I think.
[01:45:23.693 --> 01:45:24.954]  I tell you when I make a mistake.
[01:45:25.942 --> 01:45:28.726]  And I'm just an average person and I'm not perfect.
[01:45:29.527 --> 01:45:31.350]  Now that's, that's number one.
[01:45:32.051 --> 01:45:36.034]  You are who is considered to be the world's leading authority on the New World Order.
[01:45:36.054 --> 01:45:38.735]  I don't know about that, but the point is I have the number one radio show.
[01:45:38.775 --> 01:45:39.596]  That's admitted.
[01:45:40.096 --> 01:45:42.057]  And it's a great responsibility.
[01:45:42.177 --> 01:45:45.359]  But the point here is I can't make everybody happy.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.282]  And I can't sit here and put a smiling face on this and be happy.
[01:45:49.382 --> 01:45:50.242]  I get angry.
[01:45:50.723 --> 01:45:51.803]  I work too hard.
[01:45:52.544 --> 01:45:54.745]  Sometimes I've got black circles around my eyes.
[01:45:56.166 --> 01:45:57.647]  I need to take off more time.
[01:45:58.308 --> 01:45:59.068]  Somebody calls in.
[01:45:59.088 --> 01:46:00.289]  I give them three or four minutes.
[01:46:00.869 --> 01:46:02.611]  Now I did not badger that caller.
[01:46:02.751 --> 01:46:03.091]  Go ahead.
[01:46:20.333 --> 01:46:28.736]  If I might, if I may, I'd like to leave my telephone number with your producers so that in the event this gentleman from Canada is still listening that we can get in contact.
[01:46:28.856 --> 01:46:29.676]  We can't do that.
[01:46:29.716 --> 01:46:33.858]  We cannot become a dating service.
[01:46:33.938 --> 01:46:35.738]  And I don't mean that in the sense of dating.
[01:46:35.798 --> 01:46:37.419]  I mean, you know, everybody hooking up and talking.
[01:46:37.459 --> 01:46:37.959]  I understand.
[01:46:37.979 --> 01:46:38.619]  I understand.
[01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:48.643]  Alex, you are... That's because we've got one person answering the phones, running the show, and even doing the website.
[01:46:49.631 --> 01:46:50.131]  I understand.
[01:46:50.432 --> 01:46:52.673]  And my hat's off to both of you, Alex.
[01:46:52.793 --> 01:46:55.675]  Your work is tireless and I admire that.
[01:46:57.196 --> 01:46:58.076]  You have more information than I do.
[01:46:58.096 --> 01:47:03.159]  You say, you know, people tune in and they don't like the... You know, my tone, my tone's different every day.
[01:47:03.179 --> 01:47:04.980]  You know, it depends on what news I'm covering.
[01:47:05.421 --> 01:47:06.621]  All of this upsets me.
[01:47:07.322 --> 01:47:09.843]  I can't sit there and go, this is what I'm doing out there, folks.
[01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:14.086]  Hey, Mr. Tennant got arrested for making a complaint.
[01:47:14.426 --> 01:47:16.207]  Mr. Tennant, how are you doing today?
[01:47:16.507 --> 01:47:18.048]  You know, there's plenty of that out there.
[01:47:19.049 --> 01:47:19.209]  Right.
[01:47:20.828 --> 01:47:22.709]  Okay, well, thanks for the time, Alex.
[01:47:22.829 --> 01:47:24.250]  Hey, Steve, I appreciate your call.
[01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:26.311]  And again, I'm not perfect.
[01:47:27.771 --> 01:47:29.512]  Any comments about what he was saying, Doctor?
[01:47:29.532 --> 01:47:36.136]  Uh, you know, I just appreciate what he had to say and, uh, you know, God bless him.
[01:47:37.497 --> 01:47:40.459]  Alright, let's go ahead now and talk to Jim in Ohio.
[01:47:40.539 --> 01:47:41.839]  Jim, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:42.620]  Well, thank you.
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:48.003]  And for those people who've never called in, the only thing that you're asked when you call in is your first name and the state.
[01:47:48.752 --> 01:47:51.114]  There's no, nobody screens anything.
[01:47:51.174 --> 01:47:57.300]  But see, because I don't screen and I don't harass and I don't censor, I'm bad because I give callers more time than anybody else.
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:47:58.681]  Exactly.
[01:47:59.001 --> 01:48:11.713]  Hey, I was reading on Rents, a guy who wrote a book, Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free, and he interviews nine Germans who were in the Nazi, who were citizens in Germany during the Nazi regime, especially in the early 30s.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:16.662]  They said, basically, most people in Germany didn't see the tyranny.
[01:48:16.682 --> 01:48:20.745]  They said each occasion of Nazi violence was worse than the last, but only a little worse.
[01:48:21.226 --> 01:48:27.410]  So they waited for one shocking event, thinking that they would join others, if or when it happened, and rise up.
[01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:30.873]  And they waited and waited until the Nazis had complete control.
[01:48:31.393 --> 01:48:39.159]  And it seems to me that a lot of people are waiting before they get involved, or before they buy the videos and get them out to people, and that kind of thing.
[01:48:39.199 --> 01:48:40.620]  Waiting for that one big event.
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:42.141]  And it might not happen.
[01:48:43.621 --> 01:48:45.843]  And just kind of wanted to see what your thoughts were on that.
[01:48:45.863 --> 01:48:46.663]  Well, it's incremental.
[01:48:46.703 --> 01:48:57.791]  They kill protesters, kill demonstrators, shoot old ladies with rubber bullets, arrest people for suing the government, arrest people for having Rubik's Cubes at their toy store, or threaten to arrest them.
[01:48:57.811 --> 01:48:59.873]  You know, this is the type of stuff we're facing.
[01:49:00.233 --> 01:49:01.074]  It's already here.
[01:49:01.434 --> 01:49:07.058]  Well, and some of the other things that I've been reading, basically, you know, people sat back and said, oh gee, it's only the homosexuals.
[01:49:07.118 --> 01:49:08.039]  Oh, it's only the Jews.
[01:49:08.239 --> 01:49:09.400]  Oh, it's only the Christians.
[01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:10.761]  Oh, it's... and next thing,
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.461]  You know, it was everybody.
[01:49:14.241 --> 01:49:18.424]  But as long as it doesn't, you know, enter your universe, well, it's okay.
[01:49:18.644 --> 01:49:19.564]  You know, it's not me.
[01:49:20.065 --> 01:49:21.085]  You know, that kind of thing.
[01:49:21.465 --> 01:49:22.766]  Until they're knocking on your door.
[01:49:25.448 --> 01:49:26.068]  I agree with you.
[01:49:26.108 --> 01:49:26.708]  Great call.
[01:49:26.768 --> 01:49:27.509]  Thanks for the call.
[01:49:29.365 --> 01:49:31.266]  Johnny and others, your calls are up next.
[01:49:31.326 --> 01:49:33.267]  We'll finish up with our guest here on the other side.
[01:49:33.307 --> 01:49:34.627]  We'll give you his home phone number.
[01:49:34.907 --> 01:49:35.728]  He wants to do that.
[01:49:36.088 --> 01:49:36.968]  Is that correct, Doctor?
[01:49:37.208 --> 01:49:37.948]  That is correct.
[01:49:38.169 --> 01:49:44.171]  For folks in Iowa or surrounding states who would like to help him with his case, this is scary.
[01:49:44.211 --> 01:49:45.411]  I mean, this is really scary.
[01:49:45.451 --> 01:49:49.493]  Now you call up and complain, and that's considered harassment?
[01:49:50.555 --> 01:49:53.597]  Not threats, but harassment and Homeland Security comes and grabs you.
[01:49:53.877 --> 01:49:55.378]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.579 --> 01:49:58.661]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.801 --> 01:50:02.704]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.744 --> 01:50:06.967]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.327 --> 01:50:11.109]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.250 --> 01:50:13.051]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.311 --> 01:50:16.535]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.575 --> 01:50:21.300]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:24.503]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.683 --> 01:50:27.567]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:28.027 --> 01:50:34.154]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.674 --> 01:50:38.478]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:52:58.476 --> 01:53:00.397]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.878 --> 01:53:03.680]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:04.661 --> 01:53:07.022]  Rashing lies and disinformation.
[01:53:08.723 --> 01:53:14.488]  About to go to Johnny in Hawaii, but he just hung up, so in the next hour I'll get to David and Steve and Eli and everybody else.
[01:53:14.528 --> 01:53:15.628]  We're about to let our guests go.
[01:53:16.949 --> 01:53:19.951]  Arrested for calling and complaining to the VA.
[01:53:20.452 --> 01:53:22.633]  Complaining to those that are supposed to be our servants.
[01:53:22.774 --> 01:53:27.517]  I don't think I know of any other more arrogant federal agency than maybe the BATF.
[01:53:28.354 --> 01:53:33.357]  But they are the most arrogant when it comes to a quote, service agency.
[01:53:34.557 --> 01:53:38.259]  And their crimes, their abuse of the veterans are legion.
[01:53:38.699 --> 01:53:46.163]  Doctor, for folks that would like to help you in your case or to even find out what it is, they just came and arrested him and haven't even charged him.
[01:53:46.723 --> 01:53:49.205]  But then they tell the newspaper it was for harassing phone calls.
[01:53:50.345 --> 01:53:51.806]  How do folks call you, Doctor?
[01:53:53.087 --> 01:53:53.747]  My number is 563-326-24.
[01:53:58.741 --> 01:54:00.424]  And my last name is Tennant.
[01:54:00.964 --> 01:54:03.127]  Your reference librarian can put you in touch.
[01:54:03.207 --> 01:54:04.990]  I'm in Bettendorf, Iowa.
[01:54:05.290 --> 01:54:06.592]  It's a part of the Quad Cities.
[01:54:06.912 --> 01:54:07.994]  That number one more time.
[01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:10.071]  5-6-3-3-2-6-2-4-9-5.
[01:54:11.732 --> 01:54:17.175]  Well, I want to thank you for exposing the vaccines locally on the radio shows.
[01:54:17.215 --> 01:54:18.736]  I want to thank you for being involved.
[01:54:19.177 --> 01:54:28.583]  I want to thank you for coming on the show and having the courage to expose this, and please get back in touch with us as new developments take place, and God bless you, Doctor.
[01:54:28.963 --> 01:54:29.864]  God bless America.
[01:54:29.984 --> 01:54:30.364]  Thank you.
[01:54:31.004 --> 01:54:31.805]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:54:33.857 --> 01:54:41.463]  Now, we're going to start the next hour here in a few minutes, and we'll go to your calls and a bunch of other news that's really important, but I just want to say something here right now.
[01:54:43.085 --> 01:54:57.937]  For about five years, the Sunshine Radio Network, three stations in Buffalo, Rochester, and Niagara, up in northern New York, have carried this radio show.
[01:54:59.583 --> 01:55:05.286]  And I've interviewed the owner many times, a great pastor, a good Baptist American.
[01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:10.048]  And I'm so busy working so hard, the whole network knew about it.
[01:55:11.148 --> 01:55:12.189]  They sent flowers.
[01:55:13.209 --> 01:55:15.810]  And I was not told until last night, and I got very sad about it.
[01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:18.932]  I know Ted Anderson was very sad about it when he mentioned it to me.
[01:55:19.192 --> 01:55:20.252]  You know about Dr. Wolfe.
[01:55:20.932 --> 01:55:26.555]  Dr. Wolfe, who owned the stations, died two weeks ago.
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:28.941]  And now his family's taking over.
[01:55:29.541 --> 01:55:31.002]  And he was just such a great guy.
[01:55:31.102 --> 01:55:35.684]  And in there so long, fighting for pro-life, fighting against the New World Order.
[01:55:36.485 --> 01:55:37.866]  I've been a guest at his church.
[01:55:37.886 --> 01:55:40.567]  We get the telephone for their services several times.
[01:55:40.987 --> 01:55:43.268]  I've been a guest on his program a dozen times.
[01:55:43.569 --> 01:55:45.350]  He's been on this show probably a dozen times.
[01:55:46.170 --> 01:55:47.231]  And he's been on this network.
[01:55:49.457 --> 01:55:51.017]  I don't even really listen to the radio anymore.
[01:55:51.057 --> 01:55:51.977]  I'm just working all the time.
[01:55:52.058 --> 01:55:56.998]  I hadn't heard about the announcements and everything, and I just feel terrible about his passing.
[01:55:57.038 --> 01:55:58.579]  But we know he's in a better place.
[01:56:00.239 --> 01:56:02.259]  And so, God bless you, Dr. Wolf.
[01:56:02.279 --> 01:56:03.000]  You're home now.
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:07.020]  And just pray that God will send comfort to your family.
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:15.362]  And I also just want to be thankful to all the listeners, all the affiliates, all the sponsors, the great people running the show, my producers here,
[01:56:16.272 --> 01:56:22.114]  My webmasters, my wife, Violet Jones, my webmaster, one of my webmasters, Paul Watson, Steve Watson.
[01:56:23.675 --> 01:56:27.476]  And just, I'm thankful to God for this radio show, this opportunity.
[01:56:27.496 --> 01:56:34.939]  You know, I do my best, and I know I'm obnoxious, and I know I'm angry, and I know I can't listen to myself sometimes when there's a re-broadcast.
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:42.422]  I try my hardest, though, and I think people know that in their guts, and that's why, that's why this is the number one program.
[01:56:42.542 --> 01:56:44.003]  I have no idea why I listen to other shows.
[01:56:44.023 --> 01:56:44.763]  I think they're much better.
[01:56:45.545 --> 01:56:48.068]  People listen because they can tell I mean what I'm saying.
[01:56:48.729 --> 01:56:49.609]  It just comes across.
[01:56:50.210 --> 01:56:54.474]  Because I don't pre-package or frame what I'm going to say or do.
[01:56:55.095 --> 01:56:57.237]  And I live my life fighting the New World Order.
[01:56:58.619 --> 01:57:02.763]  And I love Jesus.
[01:57:03.832 --> 01:57:06.293]  And you're mad at me because I don't call him Yahweh or Yeshua.
[01:57:06.353 --> 01:57:06.693]  Fine.
[01:57:07.414 --> 01:57:08.014]  Jehovah.
[01:57:08.034 --> 01:57:09.375]  You know, you'll say, well that's a bad name too.
[01:57:09.675 --> 01:57:10.095]  Whatever.
[01:57:10.155 --> 01:57:12.596]  And you're mad at me because I don't have all the proper names or whatever.
[01:57:12.896 --> 01:57:16.498]  I know I hate evil and I love God and I love decency and I love my family.
[01:57:17.058 --> 01:57:19.659]  And I can't stand evil and I have a drive to fight it.
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:28.403]  And I just want to thank all of you for your support and I want to thank all the affiliates out there and all the great people that make it possible and all those that support it.
[01:57:29.124 --> 01:57:29.684]  God bless you.
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:34.283]  And, uh, you know, I get a hundred positive emails for every mean one.
[01:57:35.424 --> 01:57:38.447]  But you're always welcome to disagree with me to call in, you'll go to the front of the line.
[01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:47.657]  But I don't think that last call was mean, I just, I don't agree with it.
[01:57:50.179 --> 01:57:50.840]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.501 --> 01:57:52.622]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.263 --> 01:57:54.324]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.998 --> 01:57:55.819]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:57.480]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.941 --> 01:58:02.064]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.324 --> 01:58:06.468]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.851 --> 01:58:13.634]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:58:13.674 --> 01:58:14.475]  until 2 p.m.
[01:58:14.515 --> 01:58:15.676]  Central Standard Time,
[01:58:16.624 --> 01:58:18.305]  We're here live, my friends.
[01:58:18.946 --> 01:58:20.306]  Back, of course, 9 to midnight.
[01:58:20.867 --> 01:58:22.548]  Central Standard Time as well.
[01:58:22.608 --> 01:58:26.290]  The rebroadcast from 1am to 4am Central Standard Time.
[01:58:27.871 --> 01:58:33.955]  Coming up, more on the Battle of Fallujah as that goes well for US forces.
[01:58:36.216 --> 01:58:39.058]  Supposedly, according to our media, and the foreign media is saying the same thing.
[01:58:39.859 --> 01:58:41.280]  Some new election night stuff.
[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:44.942]  Because of the threat of terror, they had to count the votes in secret, of course.
[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:46.481]  We'll be getting to that.
[01:58:46.861 --> 01:58:49.263]  Bus drivers on GPS plan get lost.
[01:58:49.864 --> 01:58:51.765]  This side of the Boston Herald.
[01:58:52.085 --> 01:58:54.548]  Tucson police use violence against marchers.
[01:58:54.568 --> 01:58:56.629]  This is out of mainstream news.
[01:58:56.669 --> 01:58:58.211]  Just opened fire on them for no reason.
[01:58:58.551 --> 01:58:59.292]  With rubber bullets.
[01:59:00.072 --> 01:59:03.395]  Prop 200 had a Hispanic support also out of Arizona.
[01:59:03.956 --> 01:59:05.337]  Wow, Hispanic voters.
[01:59:06.706 --> 01:59:10.187]  A majority of them voted for what's been called an anti-immigrant plan.
[01:59:10.207 --> 01:59:10.847]  See, it's not.
[01:59:10.927 --> 01:59:13.448]  It's not racial like the media tries to make it.
[01:59:13.528 --> 01:59:16.488]  It's survival of our economy and our sovereignty.
[01:59:19.049 --> 01:59:23.490]  And continuing also, we're going to get into just so much more.
[01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:26.191]  I've got several articles here about the New World Order.
[01:59:27.211 --> 01:59:29.391]  Here's another one out of the Sydney Morning Herald.
[01:59:29.771 --> 01:59:32.092]  A winning team, a New World Order.
[01:59:33.846 --> 01:59:37.529]  First off, let's get to all these callers that have been holding patiently.
[01:59:37.549 --> 01:59:41.613]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:41.693 --> 01:59:46.317]  Let's talk to David in California.
[01:59:46.357 --> 01:59:47.277]  David, thanks for holding.
[01:59:47.297 --> 01:59:47.738]  Go ahead.
[01:59:47.998 --> 01:59:48.579]  Not a problem.
[01:59:48.599 --> 01:59:51.341]  Hey, Alex, first of all, let me tell you that you do great work.
[01:59:52.001 --> 01:59:53.042]  And you know what?
[01:59:53.082 --> 01:59:56.465]  You've never come off as gruff or rough or tough or anything like that to me.
[01:59:57.466 --> 02:00:00.949]  I just appreciate what you're doing, and I see through all of it.
[02:00:01.627 --> 02:00:03.808]  I appreciate the message that you put out there for everybody.
[02:00:03.828 --> 02:00:04.388]  Well, thank you!
[02:00:04.948 --> 02:00:07.249]  Honestly, you do great work, my man.
[02:00:07.769 --> 02:00:11.951]  Hey, what I wanted to do, and I wanted to get in when your guest was there, and unfortunately I just didn't.
[02:00:12.671 --> 02:00:17.013]  What I wanted to do is just give a heads up to your listeners about the law a little bit.
[02:00:19.214 --> 02:00:21.255]  You're familiar, obviously, with the Patriot Movement.
[02:00:22.395 --> 02:00:27.537]  First things first, though, you can't argue in two different jurisdictions.
[02:00:28.567 --> 02:00:34.963]  And what I mean simply by that is, as you know, we have a pseudo-admiralty law on land here in the United States.
[02:00:35.495 --> 02:00:39.818]  You have to pick your jurisdiction very carefully, and the only way to do that... Well, I'll tell you what, what you're saying is important.
[02:00:39.838 --> 02:00:42.320]  I'll hold you over if need be, but I've got to interrupt to do this.
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:43.020]  Go ahead.
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:48.524]  He's talking about the guest last hour, the doctor, no criminal record, arrested.
[02:00:48.564 --> 02:01:02.373]  They admit not for making threats, but making phone calls annoying the VA about not getting benefits, and so they sent Homeland Security to arrest him, and they admit he made no threats, and that's the story we were telling last hour.
[02:01:02.393 --> 02:01:02.653]  Go ahead.
[02:01:02.913 --> 02:01:18.657]  Okay, the point is, is that gentleman, first and foremost, before they ever came to visit him, he should have had on his identification, on his, and he should carry one of these, everybody should carry one of these in there, and that's a notice to an arresting officer.
[02:01:19.257 --> 02:01:28.299]  Everyone should carry one in their glove box at all times, or if they can, in some fashion, if they know they're going to be advocates, on their person at all times.
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:33.105]  On my driver's license, for example, here in California, it says, without prejudice, UCC 1207.
[02:01:35.067 --> 02:01:38.050]  In other words, what that does is that reserves the common law for me.
[02:01:38.430 --> 02:01:47.420]  In other words, if you read the United States Code... You're saying I'm not opting out of my God-given rights in your 14th Amendment slave status?
[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:48.140]  That's correct.
[02:01:48.221 --> 02:01:51.384]  However, you have to make that claim prior
[02:01:52.185 --> 02:01:56.847]  to any uh... action against you if you make it you can't make that clear.
[02:01:56.867 --> 02:02:03.991]  Let me say this, I've seen some people win with this but now the system has become so criminal what do you do when the judges and people just totally ignore that?
[02:02:04.391 --> 02:02:12.194]  well uh... and and that's where the notice to arresting officer comes in handy uh... a false arrest under the U.S.
[02:02:12.234 --> 02:02:21.899]  title correct and the two hundred thousand dollar fine you know giving giving a notice to here uh... uh... I keep one of these in my glove box at all times
[02:02:22.883 --> 02:02:28.829]  Uh, and if I'm ever going to go anywhere, if I'm going to be out in public for any reason, I'll take it out of the glove box and actually keep it with me.
[02:02:28.889 --> 02:02:30.471]  Have you ever used that successfully?
[02:02:30.491 --> 02:02:34.535]  Haven't had the opportunity or the need to as of yet.
[02:02:34.995 --> 02:02:36.076]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:02:36.456 --> 02:02:40.540]  Well, again, just, you know, I would implore your listeners to look it up.
[02:02:40.701 --> 02:02:43.443]  Find it and understand the law that it's... We got a break.
[02:02:43.463 --> 02:02:44.064]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:48.098 --> 02:02:53.559]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.999 --> 02:02:58.240]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:02:58.460 --> 02:03:05.502]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.882 --> 02:03:11.984]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.004 --> 02:03:13.324]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.684 --> 02:03:16.627]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:16.788 --> 02:03:17.689]  Eliminate the cost.
[02:03:17.769 --> 02:03:18.810]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:19.130 --> 02:03:26.378]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:26.658 --> 02:03:30.042]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:03:55.722 --> 02:04:06.948]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:07.288 --> 02:04:12.991]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:13.251 --> 02:04:19.893]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:20.113 --> 02:04:26.915]  Black Berkey elements glow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[02:04:41.582 --> 02:04:49.128]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:49.308 --> 02:04:53.732]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:53.892 --> 02:04:58.255]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:58.296 --> 02:04:59.657]  The New World Order.
[02:05:00.417 --> 02:05:01.397]  Panama!
[02:05:01.437 --> 02:05:05.659]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:05.719 --> 02:05:12.661]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:12.761 --> 02:05:14.822]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:15.142 --> 02:05:25.545]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:25.785 --> 02:05:27.746]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[02:05:28.246 --> 02:05:28.766]  Big Brother.
[02:05:28.786 --> 02:05:29.427]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:29.447 --> 02:05:30.668]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:30.948 --> 02:05:32.209]  You want answers?
[02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.769]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.189 --> 02:06:01.830]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:06.511]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:15.873 --> 02:06:20.454]  Our last caller, David in California, was getting into the Admiralty Courts.
[02:06:23.297 --> 02:06:24.978]  And that goes back to England.
[02:06:25.238 --> 02:06:32.300]  Well, even before that, with the rules of being on board a ship, a captain was judge, jury, and executioner.
[02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:35.741]  And that's the basis of martial law.
[02:06:35.781 --> 02:06:46.044]  So when you hear about admiralty courts, and this is an admiralty court, we've seen them in federal rulings, state rulings, charge people whose property they're taking if they go back to their home.
[02:06:46.704 --> 02:06:52.326]  It's just a taking by the government with no just compensation, which the Supreme Court said a few years ago they can do.
[02:06:52.366 --> 02:06:52.846]  They will say,
[02:06:53.596 --> 02:06:56.578]  You were charged under Admiralty and you're not allowed to have a jury.
[02:06:58.159 --> 02:06:59.119]  We've interviewed these people.
[02:06:59.139 --> 02:07:00.260]  We've read the court cases.
[02:07:01.621 --> 02:07:08.605]  And it goes back to being, well, a point in history where it was all expanded at the end of the Civil War in what?
[02:07:11.367 --> 02:07:21.793]  Just a few years after the Civil War when they were really expanding Reconstruction and under the 14th Amendment that had been passed at the end of the Civil War
[02:07:23.749 --> 02:07:32.673]  It took citizens from being citizens or having God-given rights, being citizens of their states, to being wards of the federal government under the 14th Amendment.
[02:07:32.693 --> 02:07:36.595]  They said, well, we can't let these black people actually have rights.
[02:07:37.256 --> 02:07:43.739]  We've got to make them wards of the state, kind of like Indians on reservations or African-Americans on plantations.
[02:07:43.819 --> 02:07:48.722]  So this is how the government did it, and ever since then they've set up the state police and
[02:07:49.449 --> 02:07:55.993]  I brought in the federal control, and you gotta have a license to leave your house now, or you get failure to ID and get arrested.
[02:07:56.013 --> 02:08:04.538]  An ID is to do something, is a license to do something that would be illegal otherwise.
[02:08:04.718 --> 02:08:05.899]  It is a permission slip.
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:13.884]  People in war zones, people in captured countries, get their ID cards so they could be controlled by the occupying government.
[02:08:14.284 --> 02:08:18.067]  Whether it was the Japanese in southern China before World War II,
[02:08:19.196 --> 02:08:24.997]  Or whether it was Nazis in Poland, in occupied Poland, or the Soviets in occupied Czechoslovakia.
[02:08:25.557 --> 02:08:32.399]  It's the same story over and over and over again, and now we've just all got them, and why we just accept this is what we do, this is part of life.
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:35.920]  So good point, David.
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:38.120]  Now let's talk to Steve in Colorado.
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:39.341]  Steve, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:08:40.901 --> 02:08:42.461]  Yeah, hey there Alex, how you doing?
[02:08:42.661 --> 02:08:43.682]  Good, thank you for calling.
[02:08:43.902 --> 02:08:44.102]  Sure.
[02:08:45.652 --> 02:08:52.675]  Yeah, well first of all, good job on your appearance on Coast to Coast the other night.
[02:08:53.295 --> 02:08:54.775]  That was really, really excellent.
[02:08:54.875 --> 02:08:55.576]  Was that good?
[02:08:55.616 --> 02:08:56.656]  Was I talking too fast?
[02:08:56.716 --> 02:08:57.897]  I was going 100 miles an hour.
[02:08:58.277 --> 02:08:59.837]  No, that was excellent.
[02:08:59.957 --> 02:09:00.678]  That was excellent.
[02:09:01.378 --> 02:09:14.643]  Anyway, I wanted to ask you about one of the things that you mentioned on that interview about OnStar, about the recorded, evidently some recorded conversations that were being from inside the car.
[02:09:15.936 --> 02:09:18.297]  Yeah, there was a couple federal court cases.
[02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:30.502]  The court out in San Francisco was at the Ninth Circuit said, it's okay for OnStar for the government without wiretaps to randomly listen to you through it with computers for keywords.
[02:09:31.363 --> 02:09:34.464]  Because that's what OnStar is, a little cell phone built into the dash.
[02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:36.309]  It's OK for them to do that.
[02:09:36.389 --> 02:09:38.590]  They just can't interrupt your service.
[02:09:39.230 --> 02:09:42.131]  And so now OnStar said, OK, we'll get around that for you.
[02:09:42.711 --> 02:09:47.512]  But yes, I mean, I said years before this happened, with the documented cases of it, that it was happening.
[02:09:47.912 --> 02:09:49.913]  But now they admit it, that it listens to you.
[02:09:50.853 --> 02:09:52.313]  OK, that was my question, basically.
[02:09:52.373 --> 02:09:55.374]  And so does a lot of the digital cable boxes have a microphone in them.
[02:09:55.414 --> 02:09:55.994]  That's admitted.
[02:09:57.259 --> 02:10:04.947]  All cell phones that were sold after 2001 are tracked, even when your phone's off, it can listen to you.
[02:10:06.008 --> 02:10:07.049]  So this is the new freedom.
[02:10:09.546 --> 02:10:13.108]  I'm not real familiar with OnStar, so I was curious about that.
[02:10:13.188 --> 02:10:31.256]  It's being put in standard now in most GM products, but the government's moving in Oregon and other states to make it the law to have a satellite tracker box, the plug-ins are already in all the new ignitions, or to have the next best thing, a K-Tag transponder that goes up to several hundred yards, so as you drive around the country in a different
[02:10:31.556 --> 02:10:34.117]  How much does it take before people finally figure out what's going on?
[02:10:34.137 --> 02:10:38.998]  I mean, how many things do you have to be slapped in the face with before people finally figure out they're keeping tabs on you?
[02:10:39.018 --> 02:10:40.339]  Anyway, another question I had was,
[02:11:00.905 --> 02:11:07.288]  You remember the story about when supposedly Chechnyans crossed the southern border?
[02:11:07.949 --> 02:11:10.890]  Yeah, that was Bill Gertz.
[02:11:11.871 --> 02:11:16.733]  Okay, well, do you know, when did they know that these people were crossing?
[02:11:16.793 --> 02:11:21.316]  In other words, was it after the fact that they realized that these people supposedly were Chechnyans?
[02:11:21.336 --> 02:11:22.676]  The reason being is,
[02:11:24.378 --> 02:11:32.381]  If they knew that they were crossing the border, then I take it that they are being the good sentinels that they should be and keeping track of these people, right?
[02:11:33.702 --> 02:11:35.803]  But if they knew they crossed, why didn't they stop them?
[02:11:35.843 --> 02:11:36.543]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:36.703 --> 02:11:37.283]  Yeah.
[02:11:37.303 --> 02:11:38.244]  Let me try to go over this.
[02:11:38.424 --> 02:11:43.486]  We don't know if Chechens, 20 Chechens, with backpacks, crossed the border.
[02:11:44.506 --> 02:11:50.289]  What we do know is that thousands of Muslims and thousands of Eastern Bloc
[02:11:51.624 --> 02:12:00.990]  Populations and Chinese get caught coming in in containers, get caught walking across the Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, Nevada, California border.
[02:12:02.071 --> 02:12:09.055]  We know that there's a thousand less roughly Border Patrol on the border now than there was before 9-11 because most of them went to be air marshals.
[02:12:09.436 --> 02:12:14.579]  So when Bush says we've hired more, yeah, hired more to fill up gaps that haven't even been refilled.
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:17.801]  There's less on the northern border as well.
[02:12:20.032 --> 02:12:23.274]  And so, it looked like neocon fear-mongering to me.
[02:12:23.294 --> 02:12:26.355]  Oh, Chechnyans from an unnamed federal source, but confirmed.
[02:12:26.776 --> 02:12:28.316]  Backpacks, could they be nukes?
[02:12:29.457 --> 02:12:41.643]  They could be creating a ledger, or kind of the history, so if the globalists do decide to suitcase-nuke a couple large cities to bring in their new world order fully, then they'll have kind of their background story.
[02:12:43.684 --> 02:12:47.226]  They've been floating this around for years, just these suitcase nukes missing.
[02:12:47.873 --> 02:12:51.376]  And what they'll do after they nuke a city is they'll totally re-engineer our lives.
[02:12:51.696 --> 02:12:53.317]  You think stuff was bad for 9-11, folks?
[02:12:53.538 --> 02:12:57.561]  They're lining it all up, preparing it, getting it ready, brainwashing people now to accept it.
[02:12:58.261 --> 02:13:08.069]  And I have no doubt that if we don't stop the Globalists, they have it on the front burner the next few years to either dirty bomb, and I pray the Globalists do nothing.
[02:13:08.970 --> 02:13:14.514]  But hopefully their planners will go with something smaller that just radiates and doesn't kill as many people.
[02:13:14.555 --> 02:13:17.457]  But the Globalists may go for a big effect and just erase a major city.
[02:13:18.457 --> 02:13:37.042]  And then it's going to be one-child policy, forced inoculations, chips under the skin of all Americans, mass arrest of millions, a huge slave economy, a huge militarized economy forming up each morning with your neighborhood commander, gray uniforms, tens of millions drafted, total global war, total domination.
[02:13:37.682 --> 02:13:39.742]  The globalists need this for their new world order.
[02:13:40.483 --> 02:13:41.783]  And they're really setting it up for this.
[02:13:41.843 --> 02:13:44.624]  I mean, it sounds crazy, just like I sounded crazy five years ago.
[02:13:45.044 --> 02:13:45.764]  This is the plan.
[02:13:46.673 --> 02:13:49.796]  And if you want total hell on earth, folks, go ahead and go along with it.
[02:13:51.357 --> 02:13:58.602]  If the globalists think for a minute that you'll go along with giving up your liberties after a bigger attack, they will implement it.
[02:13:59.783 --> 02:14:01.064]  Why would they do something evil?
[02:14:01.104 --> 02:14:02.225]  Why would they do something bad?
[02:14:02.525 --> 02:14:03.566]  Because they are evil.
[02:14:03.606 --> 02:14:04.567]  That's why they're in control.
[02:14:04.807 --> 02:14:05.808]  Because they're ruthless.
[02:14:06.749 --> 02:14:07.950]  Because this is what they're into.
[02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.930]  This is who they are.
[02:14:10.492 --> 02:14:12.833]  Look at human history and look what governments have always done.
[02:14:13.134 --> 02:14:14.715]  They always flip out and go crazy.
[02:14:16.027 --> 02:14:18.428]  During the depths of the decadent cycle.
[02:14:18.768 --> 02:14:21.529]  And we're in the depths of a decadent cycle that's never before been seen.
[02:14:24.911 --> 02:14:27.572]  I mean, look at your dollar plunging by 40 plus percent.
[02:14:27.892 --> 02:14:31.614]  Look at the jobs flooding out even faster and the government laughs and says it's good.
[02:14:32.154 --> 02:14:43.159]  Look at how the new economy is prisons and surveillance and the face scanning cameras going up in the neighborhoods and street corners and license plate scanners going up everywhere to track and trace what we do and
[02:14:44.039 --> 02:14:54.284]  Just thumb scanners to get school lunches, and cameras in the police bathrooms, even watching the police, and satellite trackers in city vehicles, and cameras in school bathrooms.
[02:14:54.584 --> 02:14:56.025]  But the border stays wide open!
[02:14:56.465 --> 02:15:08.171]  And anti-terror drills all over the country, where they simulate hundreds of students with their guts blown out, and then the simulated group is a right-wing pro-gun group, or the simulated group is homeschoolers, and it's FEMA-funded.
[02:15:08.311 --> 02:15:09.231]  It's for the Muslims!
[02:15:09.251 --> 02:15:09.952]  Those evil Muslims!
[02:15:09.972 --> 02:15:11.072]  Which, you know, some of them are evil.
[02:15:11.092 --> 02:15:19.857]  There are some real Muslim terrorists, but all of them aren't.
[02:15:32.654 --> 02:15:34.515]  And they certainly can't really threaten us, folks.
[02:15:34.555 --> 02:15:36.556]  The real Al-Qaeda is Al-Syedah.
[02:15:36.756 --> 02:15:39.318]  So they hold up the Muslim and go, give up your rights, give up your rights.
[02:15:39.338 --> 02:15:40.338]  We're only going to arrest them.
[02:15:40.358 --> 02:15:41.879]  We're only going to put them in camps.
[02:15:42.299 --> 02:15:42.980]  Camps are good.
[02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:43.700]  Torture's good.
[02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:44.360]  But it's for them.
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:44.921]  But it's for them.
[02:15:45.201 --> 02:15:53.886]  Meanwhile, the real infrastructure that I've studied with horror is for people that aren't going to take the chip, people that aren't going to turn their guns in, people that want to homeschool.
[02:15:56.707 --> 02:15:58.308]  I mean, it's really going on.
[02:16:01.089 --> 02:16:01.730]  Heaven help us.
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:03.401]  Oh my goodness.
[02:16:04.262 --> 02:16:09.388]  Let's talk to Elias in Michigan.
[02:16:09.428 --> 02:16:10.349]  Go ahead, thanks for holding.
[02:16:10.590 --> 02:16:13.073]  Yeah, the doctor intrigued me.
[02:16:14.094 --> 02:16:17.198]  I think he has what's known as the Copenhagen Syndrome.
[02:16:18.303 --> 02:16:21.808]  It seems like, you know, he's apologizing for what... You mean Stockholm?
[02:16:21.968 --> 02:16:23.670]  Oh, Stockholm, whatever you call it.
[02:16:23.690 --> 02:16:26.654]  He's apologizing for them saying they're so nice, you know.
[02:16:26.674 --> 02:16:30.239]  They only have to support their family, that's why they do this, you know.
[02:16:30.279 --> 02:16:31.480]  That's why I completely agree!
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:33.302]  It's so confusing for someone to talk like this!
[02:16:33.363 --> 02:16:37.348]  I mean, the man should be, he should be, man, I want to get them, you know?
[02:16:37.748 --> 02:16:45.730]  Hey, figure out somewhere, where's the ACLU, and where's some kind of a safety net to save people from this kind of a thing, you know?
[02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:47.971]  Well, the ACLU... I know, they're nowhere to be found, really.
[02:16:47.991 --> 02:16:50.051]  They only take cases to undermine the country.
[02:16:50.071 --> 02:16:54.292]  They're nowhere to be found, I understand, but I mean, there must... You'd think there were, but there isn't.
[02:16:54.412 --> 02:16:56.313]  You know, in this country, there isn't anybody.
[02:16:56.781 --> 02:17:02.323]  And the plain fact is, these people in this country, they believe everything the government tells them.
[02:17:02.684 --> 02:17:03.284]  They believe it.
[02:17:03.544 --> 02:17:08.666]  Why would they go and elect who they supposedly elected, if they ever were elected, if it wasn't all fake?
[02:17:08.746 --> 02:17:09.646]  Well, it's like that.
[02:17:09.766 --> 02:17:10.167]  It's like that.
[02:17:10.187 --> 02:17:11.527]  Why would they go and do that?
[02:17:11.627 --> 02:17:19.090]  It's like that back pain medicine that destroys your heart, turns out that company covered it up for five years, knew what it was doing.
[02:17:19.971 --> 02:17:21.211]  Millions of people taking it.
[02:17:21.571 --> 02:17:24.913]  Why would the corporations and the government do something bad to me?
[02:17:26.883 --> 02:17:27.704]  No, I hear you.
[02:17:27.764 --> 02:17:28.625]  Anything else, Elias?
[02:17:28.925 --> 02:17:29.546]  I think so, no.
[02:17:29.706 --> 02:17:30.327]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:17:31.628 --> 02:17:39.718]  And for those that didn't hear the last hour, we had a doctor on in Iowa, no criminal record, complain to the VA and they said, that's terrorism, not a threat.
[02:17:40.038 --> 02:17:41.740]  Complaining is terrorism and arresting.
[02:17:45.862 --> 02:17:49.024]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[02:17:49.244 --> 02:17:51.666]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[02:17:51.926 --> 02:17:57.090]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[02:17:57.250 --> 02:17:57.950]  Well, no more.
[02:17:58.130 --> 02:18:01.093]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[02:18:01.393 --> 02:18:04.595]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[02:18:04.855 --> 02:18:10.339]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[02:18:10.579 --> 02:18:13.121]  It's called hyaluronic acid or HA.
[02:18:13.401 --> 02:18:21.187]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.

[02:20:03.658 --> 02:20:06.360]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:10.483]  I ordered Hemtab online, and soon after taking Hemtab, the pain was gone.
[02:20:10.703 --> 02:20:12.664]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[02:20:12.945 --> 02:20:13.385]  Miracle?

[02:21:49.925 --> 02:21:53.688]  I'm just going to take four more calls from Regina and Dave and
[02:21:54.887 --> 02:21:59.891]  Harold, because I got a ton of news here we haven't gotten to yet in a few stories.
[02:22:00.311 --> 02:22:01.092]  I want to recap.
[02:22:01.792 --> 02:22:03.774]  Right now, going back to Elias in Michigan.
[02:22:03.814 --> 02:22:04.734]  Finish up what you were saying?
[02:22:04.875 --> 02:22:05.835]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:22:05.855 --> 02:22:06.736]  Yeah, on to Iraq.
[02:22:06.756 --> 02:22:10.679]  The news comes out that there was possibly 100,000, 200,000 civilian deaths there.
[02:22:10.779 --> 02:22:12.961]  I don't know whether you believe that or not.
[02:22:19.386 --> 02:22:20.967]  I don't know what I heard on your program.
[02:22:21.287 --> 02:22:21.787]  Uh, yes.
[02:22:21.947 --> 02:22:25.528]  Conservatively, there have been a million and a half deaths under the sanctions.
[02:22:25.908 --> 02:22:26.769]  No, I don't mean that.
[02:22:26.849 --> 02:22:27.509]  I mean simply.
[02:22:27.529 --> 02:22:31.050]  No, I mean... This is so-called war that they have indulged in.
[02:22:31.350 --> 02:22:33.531]  There have been over a hundred thousand civilian deaths.
[02:22:34.491 --> 02:22:35.512]  Our government says 25,000.
[02:22:35.672 --> 02:22:40.613]  Yeah, well, you know... The Arabs... That is not reasonable at all.
[02:22:41.034 --> 02:22:41.874]  Our government... Okay.
[02:22:42.074 --> 02:22:44.875]  Yeah, but of course people believe it because they want to believe the government.
[02:22:45.315 --> 02:22:45.435]  See?
[02:22:46.135 --> 02:22:47.656]  Everybody wants to believe what the government says.
[02:22:48.297 --> 02:22:50.579]  A million and a half died under the sanctions.
[02:22:50.599 --> 02:22:51.460]  Oh, well, we know that.
[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:52.581]  Yes, that's a long tail.
[02:22:53.121 --> 02:22:53.742]  Europe says 100,000.
[02:22:53.802 --> 02:22:57.165]  Our government says 25,000.
[02:22:57.605 --> 02:22:58.606]  And the Arabs say 200,000.
[02:22:58.686 --> 02:22:59.947]  What do you think?
[02:23:01.408 --> 02:23:03.590]  Uh, I think the 100,000 number is pretty accurate.
[02:23:03.630 --> 02:23:07.554]  I mean, they call it precision bombing when they've got A-10 warthogs.
[02:23:07.594 --> 02:23:11.177]  Well, it's not very precise when you're just machine gun people standing around on the street.
[02:23:12.398 --> 02:23:13.279]  I hear you, thanks.
[02:23:13.599 --> 02:23:21.384]  You know, they're just afraid of them, you know, they're afraid they might have something, so best to just cut them in half, you know, and hopefully that they will get it, you know.
[02:23:21.745 --> 02:23:22.805]  Thanks for the call, Elias.
[02:23:23.966 --> 02:23:29.410]  Yeah, just to restate that, 5,000 civilian deaths is too much.
[02:23:29.430 --> 02:23:31.432]  10,000 is too much.
[02:23:31.592 --> 02:23:33.193]  Our government says 25,000.
[02:23:33.673 --> 02:23:35.635]  The European monitors and press says 100,000.
[02:23:35.675 --> 02:23:37.776]  The Arabs say 200,000 since the war started.
[02:23:42.104 --> 02:23:43.185]  Two and a half years ago.
[02:23:44.646 --> 02:23:45.927]  I don't know, but I know this.
[02:23:46.008 --> 02:24:05.864]  When they've got Puff the Magic Dragon C-130s with twin howitzers and Vulcan guns, Gatling guns, flying around blasting the city for five days straight, and F-15s and F-16s dropping 1,000 and 2,000 pound bombs, and when they've got tanks lined up opening fire on the city,
[02:24:06.610 --> 02:24:34.009]  or a five-day bombardment before all this that's not precision and I've seen the video from Al Jazeera and other places of just dead bodies as far as the eye can see dead bloated toddlers and babies and dead women and I've seen the footage of people running to the streets to go see a fight or some smoking vehicles and obviously they're not combatants and this is part of a bloodlust our government kills them which only creates more resistance so
[02:24:36.999 --> 02:24:39.181]  Again, folks, our government put Saddam in.
[02:24:39.301 --> 02:24:43.145]  Our government told Saddam to invade Kuwait.
[02:24:43.205 --> 02:24:44.866]  Told him to go ahead and attack Iran.
[02:24:45.567 --> 02:24:47.608]  Our government put Manuel Moriega in.
[02:24:47.688 --> 02:24:49.270]  Our government put Mao Zedong in.
[02:24:49.350 --> 02:24:50.951]  Our government put Fidel Castro in.
[02:24:51.231 --> 02:24:52.232]  This is all admitted!
[02:24:54.074 --> 02:24:57.657]  And they do it over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[02:24:58.217 --> 02:25:00.679]  Creating crises to offer a solution.
[02:25:00.999 --> 02:25:02.741]  Regina in Pennsylvania, welcome.
[02:25:03.587 --> 02:25:06.750]  Hi Alex, I just want to stand up for the doctor there.
[02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:08.591]  I really feel for that man.
[02:25:08.631 --> 02:25:13.095]  He sounds like he's been trying to raise his family and he didn't get a chance to listen to you about the Patriot Act.
[02:25:13.835 --> 02:25:20.160]  And I just feel like in my heart that we need to pray for him and we are all so separated.
[02:25:20.501 --> 02:25:24.504]  When an individual goes down, he's just silenced and we don't hear from him again.
[02:25:25.494 --> 02:25:33.079]  Are you talking about the doctor last hour who the police admit did not threaten anybody, but they say complaining is an act of terrorism.
[02:25:33.119 --> 02:25:34.260]  It's actually in the newspaper.
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:37.202]  And he was arrested for complaining to the VA.
[02:25:37.762 --> 02:25:41.085]  Right, and I think this is just like this election here.
[02:25:41.105 --> 02:25:45.708]  You know, they're saying that the born-again Christians or whatever won an election.
[02:25:45.728 --> 02:25:48.209]  I think the pharmaceutical companies won an election.
[02:25:48.389 --> 02:25:51.972]  And you know, I thank the Lord for Tuck Baldwin exposing
[02:25:52.762 --> 02:25:55.165]  The confusion in the Specter mantra up here.
[02:25:55.205 --> 02:25:58.249]  If anybody wants to read that, go right for it.
[02:25:58.469 --> 02:25:59.390]  Don't waste your time.
[02:25:59.511 --> 02:26:02.254]  For those that just joined us, tell them about what Specter's doing.
[02:26:02.955 --> 02:26:11.606]  Well, Specter was supported by George Bush and Senator Rick Santorum, our great pro-family, pro-life, you know,
[02:26:12.168 --> 02:26:14.690]  Senator up here in Pennsylvania during the election.
[02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:19.032]  Specter is against a real conservative who is running against Specter.
[02:26:19.413 --> 02:26:27.198]  Specter is pro-abort, pro-everything, and Specter says he's going to block all the nominations if they're not pro-abort, and Bush loves him.
[02:26:27.838 --> 02:26:36.944]  Well, he also is for therapeutic clinic, which means that he's for, you know, using the human baby in research, and I believe I sent you some information from Children of God for Life.
[02:26:36.964 --> 02:26:39.826]  If you ever get a chance to look at that and get her on
[02:26:40.273 --> 02:26:43.335]  I think that's the real battle here concerning what happened in Pennsylvania.
[02:26:43.355 --> 02:26:48.979]  And then you had this, because the fetal tissue being in the vaccinations, they have shut us up on that.
[02:26:49.559 --> 02:26:50.940]  And she's bringing it out.
[02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:54.803]  I feel that we just have to bring and rally together because... Yeah, that's another thing.
[02:26:54.863 --> 02:26:58.125]  Dozens of these major vaccines are made out of dead babies for us.
[02:26:58.165 --> 02:26:58.866]  Right, right.
[02:26:58.906 --> 02:27:00.507]  And so Spectre was great for that.
[02:27:00.527 --> 02:27:05.230]  So you get the busy family people, all busy when we should be running after the free trade of the Americas.
[02:27:05.816 --> 02:27:08.817]  And the reason I'm calling is I wanted to try to get into this guy.
[02:27:08.837 --> 02:27:13.618]  I'm not sure how much John Hamill could help him, but John Hamill, are you familiar with him?
[02:27:13.638 --> 02:27:14.798]  I mean, he's one like you.
[02:27:14.838 --> 02:27:15.998]  He does his own research.
[02:27:16.559 --> 02:27:19.339]  Just call the doctor up and give him the advice, Regina.
[02:27:19.359 --> 02:27:19.959]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:28.281]  And speaking of that, I'm going to read part of this Kominsky article and part of that Baldwin article after we finish up with callers and hit some other news, because I never got to it yesterday.

[02:30:46.788 --> 02:30:51.892]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.592 --> 02:30:54.834]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:56.053 --> 02:30:59.276]  Dave in Maryland, your calls are coming up after I finish this news.
[02:31:00.637 --> 02:31:01.778]  And that'll be it for calls.
[02:31:01.838 --> 02:31:02.979]  Always enjoy all your calls.
[02:31:03.099 --> 02:31:04.840]  Gotta make some time for the news here.
[02:31:05.361 --> 02:31:06.381]  We haven't gotten to yet.
[02:31:07.142 --> 02:31:09.024]  This is from the FDA website.
[02:31:09.144 --> 02:31:12.807]  It's on infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[02:31:12.827 --> 02:31:17.470]  FDA announcing major initiatives for dietary supplements.
[02:31:18.131 --> 02:31:24.396]  In the coming 12 months we will be under a level of attack that we haven't seen since the early 90s when Bill Clinton raided
[02:31:25.299 --> 02:31:28.440]  Hundreds of vitamin sellers with armed police.
[02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:37.884]  We're going to have to fight for the domestic front as well as the international front if we wish to maintain our access to dietary supplements, which have already been banned in many areas of Europe.
[02:31:38.444 --> 02:31:47.688]  Many of the avenues by which the FDA will be attacking in the coming year will be via pharma-created loopholes in the Dietary Supplement Health Act and Education Act of 1994.
[02:31:50.020 --> 02:31:53.849]  They've got a link to the FDA, and I went and read it this morning, and they're going to do it again.
[02:31:53.989 --> 02:31:59.342]  Try to shut down the most basic of vitamin sales, so go check that out.
[02:32:00.425 --> 02:32:03.988]  Interesting little article here out of Local 6 News out of Miami.
[02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:08.112]  Liquified heroin discovered in fruit juice boxes in Florida.
[02:32:08.552 --> 02:32:15.898]  Nearly 100 fruit juice boxes containing liquid heroin were intercepted Wednesday in a shipment from Columbia, federal officials say.
[02:32:16.419 --> 02:32:17.400]  It was called HIT.
[02:32:18.100 --> 02:32:20.042]  You get a HIT, kill you if you drank it.
[02:32:21.008 --> 02:32:27.210]  And the juice boxes were part of a private shipment that wasn't destined for the United States food supply.
[02:32:27.270 --> 02:32:32.351]  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents said the juice would be deadly if consumed.
[02:32:33.352 --> 02:32:33.672]  Yes.
[02:32:34.632 --> 02:32:39.774]  Hillary's friends are saying that her presidential bid is already heating up.
[02:32:39.874 --> 02:32:44.055]  The ink was barely dry on John Kerry's concession speech when Hillary Clinton
[02:32:44.998 --> 02:32:47.960]  Again, laying the groundwork for her own presidential bid.
[02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:50.361]  Clinton insiders have told U.S.
[02:32:50.441 --> 02:32:51.621]  News and World Report.
[02:32:52.182 --> 02:32:59.325]  Associates say that she already has organized a team to target fundraising prospects, create voter lists, and draw up campaign agenda.
[02:32:59.626 --> 02:33:01.647]  The magazine reports in this week's edition.
[02:33:02.687 --> 02:33:05.729]  And that's who you're going to have running against Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:33:06.849 --> 02:33:12.172]  And then conservatives will go, well, most of us are against Arnold being president, but he's better than Hillary.
[02:33:16.203 --> 02:33:29.693]  Just absolutely amazing to see the type of things that they're doing, the type of things that they're setting up and that they're getting away with.
[02:33:31.154 --> 02:33:42.203]  And I just hope that everybody out there realizes that a choice between Arnold Schwarzenegger and a choice between Hillary Clinton is no choice at all.
[02:33:44.887 --> 02:33:46.528]  Continuing here with the news.
[02:33:46.548 --> 02:33:48.969]  This is out of the New Zealand Herald.
[02:33:49.149 --> 02:33:52.051]  Fingerprint protest worker fired.
[02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:55.272]  And more and more people call this show.
[02:33:55.292 --> 02:33:57.953]  Work at department stores, grocery stores, banks.
[02:33:58.854 --> 02:34:01.115]  Everywhere you have to thumb scan to clock in.
[02:34:01.775 --> 02:34:05.817]  And then next it's going to be you have to thumb scan to activate your national ID card.
[02:34:05.837 --> 02:34:07.518]  That's the admitted federal plan.
[02:34:07.918 --> 02:34:13.181]  David Barnes has fortified his job at an Auckland printing works.
[02:34:14.289 --> 02:34:14.830]  Fortified.
[02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:16.591]  I can't seem to read, folks.
[02:34:16.951 --> 02:34:27.340]  David Barnes has forfeited his job at an Auckland Printing Works rather than become a marked commodity by surrendering his fingerprints to his employer.
[02:34:29.322 --> 02:34:33.346]  And if just 10% of us would say no, folks, and start suing, they wouldn't be able to do this.
[02:34:34.627 --> 02:34:37.870]  Where does it all end, he said yesterday, of his dismissal as a
[02:34:39.540 --> 02:34:42.381]  Maintenance Engineer for P.M.P.
[02:34:42.801 --> 02:34:44.521]  Print in Worry.
[02:34:45.342 --> 02:34:54.204]  Ultimately, we'll be no more than producers and consumers in an extremely regulated Big Brother society that I don't wish to be a part of.
[02:34:54.884 --> 02:35:07.448]  Mr. Barnes 52 was sacked last month for alleged serious misconduct for refusing to allow his fingerprints to be scanned into a machine for identification when clocking on and off.
[02:35:08.607 --> 02:35:12.811]  He said this would have violated his religious and ethical beliefs.
[02:35:13.792 --> 02:35:29.206]  About 30% of the 160 or so staff at the site have been similarly reluctant to provide their prints, he said, but although another man quit, the rest gave in after what he claimed was merely token resistance by their union, of which he is not a member.
[02:35:32.305 --> 02:35:34.806]  I've talked to H-E-B employees here in Austin.
[02:35:34.826 --> 02:35:43.730]  By the way, H-E-B food stores in Houston and College Station and some of the stores three years ago, when you go to the self-checkout, they have a thumb scanner there and you have to do that.
[02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:47.671]  I have a clip of that from the news in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:35:50.292 --> 02:35:52.053]  And it hooks into the driver's license database.
[02:35:52.233 --> 02:35:58.836]  But they're starting all over the state, it's the biggest chain here in the state, making their employees do it.
[02:36:00.453 --> 02:36:04.617]  And we've had a lot of employees who are listeners, including high-level managers who refused.
[02:36:05.038 --> 02:36:09.442]  They give them a waiver form, but then they start getting demoted later.
[02:36:11.424 --> 02:36:13.606]  So it's just amazing.
[02:36:15.868 --> 02:36:19.791]  And you know, if they sell it, it's got, you know, this will stop fraud clocking in and out.
[02:36:20.993 --> 02:36:24.356]  Well, they could have it where the thing took a digital photo of you for the records.
[02:36:25.954 --> 02:36:26.914]  Just as quick and easy.
[02:36:27.375 --> 02:36:33.477]  No, they want that thumbprint because of the new national sales tax that Karl Rove has now been on Meet the Press proposing.
[02:36:34.757 --> 02:36:36.758]  You know, Bush is going to fix the income tax.
[02:36:36.818 --> 02:36:38.718]  Yeah, keep the income tax, but lower it.
[02:36:38.999 --> 02:36:45.881]  Give you a new national sales tax that brings federal control into every single business in the country.
[02:36:46.281 --> 02:36:48.682]  And tracks and traces what you buy, what you sell, what you do.
[02:36:49.798 --> 02:36:56.182]  You'll have to swipe your card and thumbprint, because quote, the poor people can't pay sales tax, so it's going to be a graduated sales tax.
[02:36:56.582 --> 02:37:05.768]  That's the official plan, but my praise goes to this gentleman over there in Kiwiland.
[02:37:07.229 --> 02:37:10.571]  Ashcroft may be first of cabinet chiefs to leave.
[02:37:10.651 --> 02:37:13.712]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[02:37:13.732 --> 02:37:16.174]  Attorney General John Ashcroft, who
[02:37:17.086 --> 02:37:22.007]  Use of tough tactics to fight terrorism has made him a lightning rod for critics of the Bush administration.
[02:37:22.327 --> 02:37:23.648]  He's expected to step down soon.
[02:37:23.728 --> 02:37:33.950]  Aides said last week Ashcroft could depart before Bush is inaugurated, January 20th, for a second term, making him among the first cabinet officials to depart.
[02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:43.392]  Aides has spoken on a condition of anonymity, cautioned that Ashcroft hasn't submitted his formal resignation, and said that if Bush asks him, he might remain for a while.
[02:37:46.523 --> 02:37:51.964]  And no word yet on who we could see as the replacement.
[02:37:52.004 --> 02:37:56.285]  But again, Bill Clinton did this, Bush is probably going to do this.
[02:37:56.925 --> 02:38:04.827]  People who become unpopular, they just give you new people so you have to learn their names and then have to build up resistance to the personality again.
[02:38:05.147 --> 02:38:06.688]  But Ashcroft is just a puppet.
[02:38:06.768 --> 02:38:08.028]  Ashcroft ran nothing.
[02:38:09.139 --> 02:38:18.907]  And Ashcroft's a member of the Brotherhood, this bizarre so-called Christian organization that believes in the teachings of Frederick Nietzsche, who is an avowed Satanist.
[02:38:20.168 --> 02:38:23.150]  Now that's, by the way, been in Harper's Magazine and other publications.
[02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:25.132]  It's a bizarre cult.
[02:38:26.853 --> 02:38:32.077]  A winning team, a New World Order, Sydney Morning Herald, talks about Bush's New World Order.
[02:38:33.619 --> 02:38:34.559]  Here's another article.
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:37.482]  This is out of the Cincinnati Inquirer.
[02:38:38.536 --> 02:38:42.237]  And every time I say the Inquirer, I get emails going the National Inquirer.
[02:38:42.557 --> 02:38:45.078]  No, there are hundreds of papers called the Inquirer.
[02:38:45.498 --> 02:38:46.479]  I'm not talking down.
[02:38:46.539 --> 02:38:51.901]  Most of the listeners know this, but the National Inquirer is not the Cincinnati Inquirer.
[02:38:52.261 --> 02:38:54.862]  It's the respected daily paper of Cincinnati.
[02:38:58.043 --> 02:39:01.924]  Alone in Ohio, officials cited homeland security.
[02:39:03.144 --> 02:39:05.185]  Cited concerns about potential terrorism.
[02:39:05.225 --> 02:39:07.786]  Warren County officials locked down the
[02:39:08.647 --> 02:39:15.590]  County administration building on election night and blocked anyone from observing the vote count as the nation awaited Ohio's returns.
[02:39:15.950 --> 02:39:19.091]  And it turns out Kerry did win the state.
[02:39:19.111 --> 02:39:21.512]  400,000 challenged provisional ballots.
[02:39:22.073 --> 02:39:23.493]  They told you it was 170.
[02:39:23.793 --> 02:39:25.194]  Bush won by a little over 100,000.
[02:39:25.554 --> 02:39:27.595]  Most of those were Democratic votes.
[02:39:27.915 --> 02:39:28.895]  Kerry would have won.
[02:39:29.636 --> 02:39:31.176]  Same stuff happened in New Mexico.
[02:39:31.657 --> 02:39:32.457]  Again, folks,
[02:39:33.146 --> 02:39:34.389]  Kerry wasn't meant to win.
[02:39:34.689 --> 02:39:35.731]  Kerry didn't challenge.
[02:39:35.792 --> 02:39:36.693]  Kerry capitulated.
[02:39:36.954 --> 02:39:40.020]  By me stating the truth, it doesn't mean I'm for Kerry.
[02:39:40.060 --> 02:39:41.383]  It just means I'm stating the facts.
[02:39:42.485 --> 02:39:43.708]  It doesn't matter who won.
[02:39:45.491 --> 02:39:56.097]  County officials say they took the action Tuesday night for Homeland Security, although state elections officials said they don't know of any other Ohio County that closed off its elections board.
[02:39:56.177 --> 02:40:00.039]  Many organizations protested, saying it violated the law and the public's rights.
[02:40:00.439 --> 02:40:11.625]  The Warren results, delayed for hours because of long lines that extended voting, passed the schedule, closed the polls, were part of the latest tallies that helped clench President Bush's election.
[02:40:12.326 --> 02:40:12.866]  So, these are
[02:40:13.607 --> 02:40:14.568]  They locked it down.
[02:40:14.608 --> 02:40:19.831]  It usually goes Democrat, but after the special tampering, suddenly he got a lot of extra needed votes out of that.
[02:40:23.233 --> 02:40:28.917]  The lawyer for the Inquirer said this is a process that should be done in complete transparency, and it wasn't.
[02:40:29.878 --> 02:40:32.960]  But the emergency management head said it's to fight terror.
[02:40:34.781 --> 02:40:36.262]  Everything is to fight terror now.
[02:40:38.869 --> 02:40:51.403]  Let me read just quickly, and I will get to these two final calls, but let me just re-read this because I kind of sped over it yesterday and I'm told we have one of those twice yearly satellite hiccups while I was reading this, so I want to get this out.
[02:40:52.765 --> 02:40:54.106]  This is Chuck Baldwin.
[02:40:55.988 --> 02:41:00.193]  Christians and conservatives can go back to sleep now because the boogeyman is gone.
[02:41:00.916 --> 02:41:10.823]  On November 2nd, millions of evangelical Christians and social conservatives awakened from their traditional four-year hibernation just in time to re-elect President George W. Bush.
[02:41:11.184 --> 02:41:12.865]  What horrid event awakened them?
[02:41:13.185 --> 02:41:16.167]  It was the presence of a big bad boogeyman named John Kerry.
[02:41:16.748 --> 02:41:18.669]  Boogeyman Kerry was a dreadful monster.
[02:41:18.709 --> 02:41:19.430]  He drank blood.
[02:41:20.385 --> 02:41:22.307]  He bit the heads off of birds.
[02:41:22.327 --> 02:41:23.368]  He mutilated animals.
[02:41:23.628 --> 02:41:25.489]  He huffed and puffed and blew down houses.
[02:41:26.010 --> 02:41:28.231]  He pushed little old ladies down staircases.
[02:41:28.632 --> 02:41:30.533]  He played polo with human skulls.
[02:41:30.934 --> 02:41:33.416]  As a child, his favorite game was kick the cat.
[02:41:33.796 --> 02:41:35.037]  He was a heinous creature.
[02:41:35.097 --> 02:41:39.941]  However, Christians and conservatives can now go back to sleep because the dreaded boogeyman is gone.
[02:41:40.441 --> 02:41:43.804]  The order of death member of Skull and Bones, Bush's cousin, I would add.
[02:41:44.304 --> 02:41:47.127]  After all, snoozing is what Christians and conservatives do best.
[02:41:47.627 --> 02:41:49.729]  Their naps come in four-year increments.
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:57.486]  Disturbed only every presidential election cycle by the pounding footsteps of the latest Democratic boogeyman.
[02:41:57.546 --> 02:42:01.429]  And now that the boogeyman is gone, they can go back to sleep and buddy-bye.
[02:42:02.671 --> 02:42:13.560]  In the event, however, that a few Christians and conservatives are still only putting on their pajamas and have not yet quite made it back to the sack, let me tell you what you missed
[02:42:14.201 --> 02:42:24.851]  In the last four years, while you were unconscious, your knight in shining armor, George W. Bush, superintended over the deaths of more than 4 million innocent unborn babies, and did nothing to stop their slaughter.
[02:42:25.431 --> 02:42:31.937]  And now he controls, with a bigger majority, the House and Senate, the Supreme Court, 7 of the 9, the Executive, 34 state governors,
[02:42:34.611 --> 02:42:35.292]  Let's continue.
[02:42:35.692 --> 02:42:42.699]  Your anointed leader increased federal funding for abortions at home and abroad to record levels, including for forced abortions in China.
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:48.686]  Your pro-family president appointed numerous open homosexuals to high office within the federal government.
[02:42:49.206 --> 02:42:56.534]  Went after, I would add, New Jersey governor, who's a Democrat, but is protecting David Dreyer of California!
[02:42:57.797 --> 02:42:59.598]  Again, you've also got selective amnesia.
[02:42:59.978 --> 02:43:05.542]  Your conservative president increased federal spending more than any administration, Republican or Democrat, in modern history.
[02:43:06.002 --> 02:43:17.670]  This staunch defender of limited government increased the size and scope of the federal government by pushing through Congress legislation creating federal police powers that can only be described as despotic and tyrannical.
[02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:24.274]  Your hero of conservative increased funding for virtually every great society program ever invented.
[02:43:24.938 --> 02:43:32.080]  He increased funding for the Department of Education, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Legal Services Corporation, etc., etc., etc., etc.
[02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:42.683]  This wonderful president, who desires to keep America safe and secure, proposed granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens, all of whom are criminals, and many of whom are potential terrorists.
[02:43:43.203 --> 02:43:46.944]  Before you went to sleep four years ago, gasoline prices were less than $1.25.
[02:43:47.764 --> 02:43:53.046]  Now, when you got out of bed, did you happen to notice that Bush's energy policies, gas prices now exceed $2 a gallon?
[02:43:56.539 --> 02:43:57.440]  Hold the page here.
[02:43:59.081 --> 02:44:06.707]  I could tell you much, much more of what you missed while you were sleeping, but it only might cause you to stay awake, and we mustn't not let that happen.
[02:44:06.987 --> 02:44:10.510]  So have a good four-year snap, and know that the boogeyman is gone.
[02:44:10.810 --> 02:44:13.972]  I'm sure you'll wake up in time to chase away the next Democratic boogeyman in 08.
[02:44:15.193 --> 02:44:18.276]  And I would add, who will be Hillary, and you can elect Schwarzenegger.
[02:44:18.576 --> 02:44:21.418]  More liberal voting record than Hillary, if it's possible.
[02:44:22.236 --> 02:44:35.762]  Of course, we can't know how many more liberties we'll lose, and how many more unborn babies will be killed, and how many more tax dollars our federal government will be spending by 2008, but that's one of the great advantages to being asleep, isn't it?
[02:44:36.082 --> 02:44:36.602]  Good night.
[02:44:37.022 --> 02:44:38.363]  See you in four years.
[02:44:42.384 --> 02:44:45.426]  And then, speed reading for me again.
[02:44:45.466 --> 02:44:48.547]  Let's go ahead and... I know it's still slow, but I'm not good at speed reading.
[02:44:49.007 --> 02:44:51.048]  This is on Infowars.com.
[02:44:52.694 --> 02:44:53.915]  American Sunset!
[02:44:54.035 --> 02:44:56.437]  Look, dear, don't the Kendrills look lovely tonight?
[02:44:56.497 --> 02:44:57.377]  John Kaminsky.
[02:44:58.618 --> 02:45:02.300]  Oh, the gnashing of teeth, the beating of breasts, the wailings of woe.
[02:45:02.781 --> 02:45:04.462]  Bush and the Republicans stole the election.
[02:45:04.502 --> 02:45:05.643]  Big surprise, eh?
[02:45:06.063 --> 02:45:10.706]  The neocon Nazis have done nothing but break the law since before they ever took office.
[02:45:11.126 --> 02:45:13.648]  You're expecting fair play from them, perchance?
[02:45:14.429 --> 02:45:35.394]  Much as I admire many of my friends who have desperately been trying to tell everyone that the exit polls match the election results in all the states with a paper trail, but didn't in the states without one, suspiciously and substantially favoring Bush instead, they all are, to put it politely,
[02:45:38.109 --> 02:45:39.091]  Blowing hot air.
[02:45:39.211 --> 02:45:45.324]  Perhaps they hope to find a prosecutor aspiring to career suicide.
[02:45:45.364 --> 02:45:49.533]  Or maybe a judge who wishes to see his family killed in some kind of odd accident.
[02:45:50.268 --> 02:45:52.249]  An inexplicable plane crash, perhaps.
[02:45:52.949 --> 02:46:14.296]  Of course, it is of some substantive concern that the American electoral process has been placed in the hands of partisan corporations, guaranteeing about as much integrity as typical government reports saying antidepressants are good for children, or the feds have no idea who committed the anthrax murders, or corporations should not be held liable for their lethal products.
[02:46:15.825 --> 02:46:17.226]  Because it's bad for business.
[02:46:17.807 --> 02:46:21.611]  Your vote didn't count last time, why would you expect it to count now?
[02:46:22.151 --> 02:46:24.774]  And anyway, here's a more important question.
[02:46:25.474 --> 02:46:37.146]  How in an election year where the central questions should have been about waging wars based on well-known lies and throwing away the lives of American soldiers, chasing phantoms who don't exist, as well as
[02:46:37.873 --> 02:46:45.195]  Questioning the cynical cover-up of the greatest crime in American history, where 3,000 Americans were murdered by these same phantoms.
[02:46:45.735 --> 02:46:53.917]  How could these momentous questions be overshadowed on election day by relatively irrelevant brouhaha about gay marriage?
[02:46:54.017 --> 02:46:56.958]  Which again is important, but not to the globalists.
[02:46:56.978 --> 02:46:57.958]  It's a red herring to them.
[02:46:58.798 --> 02:47:01.839]  And not to mention debates about Vietnam.
[02:47:03.803 --> 02:47:10.710]  In fact, it was because the loyal opposition chose not to mention these issues, but instead participated in the media cover-up of these crimes.
[02:47:11.571 --> 02:47:15.575]  Because, in fact, there is only one party in this country, the party of the banks.
[02:47:16.956 --> 02:47:19.239]  On that level, this election was a complete sham.
[02:47:19.499 --> 02:47:26.606]  There was no real contest, so why are you so upset about the results of an election in which both candidates were saying the same thing?
[02:47:27.489 --> 02:47:33.713]  It's only too appropriate that the results were manipulated given the insincere similarity of the candidates.
[02:47:34.953 --> 02:47:40.696]  Evil electronic electioneering and deliberately distracting debates are not the top stories of this election.
[02:47:41.857 --> 02:47:50.662]  When all was said and done, her vote didn't really matter because John Kerry essentially agreed with everything Bush had done during his capital crime-plagued first term.
[02:47:51.983 --> 02:47:54.304]  Terry promised to increase the war effort in Iraq.
[02:47:54.544 --> 02:47:58.885]  He accepts the reality of the cover story of Arab hijackers.
[02:47:59.105 --> 02:48:01.545]  He helped write the Patriot Act 15 years ago.
[02:48:01.825 --> 02:48:06.666]  He helped cover up the BCCI scandal, another one of those great robberies in American history.
[02:48:07.146 --> 02:48:18.489]  So why are so many upset that Republicans, vote counting executives, stole the election for Bush in Ohio, Florida, Georgia, and who knows where else?
[02:48:19.477 --> 02:48:26.685]  We know having Kerry, Bush's fraternity brother in the White House, would have made absolutely no difference in terms of government policy.
[02:48:28.667 --> 02:48:29.648]  That's all I have time to read.
[02:48:29.668 --> 02:48:32.831]  I'll take a few final calls and hit a few final news stories in the next segment.
[02:48:34.072 --> 02:48:35.554]  And just think about this.
[02:48:37.876 --> 02:48:39.278]  Just think about it.
[02:48:39.298 --> 02:48:41.220]  There's no real difference between these individuals.
[02:48:42.236 --> 02:48:44.677]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv, stay with us.
[02:48:46.078 --> 02:48:52.942]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.242 --> 02:48:54.603]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.803 --> 02:48:57.024]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:57.144 --> 02:48:59.246]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.506 --> 02:49:04.448]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.789 --> 02:49:08.831]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:09.071 --> 02:49:10.833]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.913 --> 02:49:21.583]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.723 --> 02:49:23.625]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.825 --> 02:49:27.709]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[02:49:27.789 --> 02:49:29.071]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[02:49:45.268 --> 02:49:48.290]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:48.590 --> 02:49:53.513]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:53.774 --> 02:49:58.136]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:58.437 --> 02:50:07.342]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:07.563 --> 02:50:11.165]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:11.465 --> 02:50:16.494]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:16.795 --> 02:50:23.547]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:50:24.007 --> 02:50:24.568]  What about you?
[02:50:25.288 --> 02:50:30.651]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:53:05.143 --> 02:53:06.843]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:53:21.064 --> 02:53:23.606]  Just giving somebody a little bit of the truth doesn't really wake them up.
[02:53:23.706 --> 02:53:33.212]  But hit them upside the head with these videos, the equivalent of a psychological info bomb 2x4, will get people's attention, is having an effect.
[02:53:33.752 --> 02:53:38.795]  But if we don't cause a renaissance of understanding of who's behind this terror, it is over, folks.
[02:53:38.836 --> 02:53:47.261]  They're building the control grid all around us to track and trace everywhere you go, what you do, the remote control to kill your car, to scan your license plate,
[02:53:48.312 --> 02:53:49.952]  They're training your kids how to be slaves.
[02:53:50.033 --> 02:53:51.333]  We've got to change this now.
[02:53:51.633 --> 02:53:53.273]  This is not popular with anybody.
[02:53:55.074 --> 02:53:56.754]  We've got to take control of this government.
[02:53:56.794 --> 02:53:58.555]  We've got to peaceably fix this.
[02:53:59.895 --> 02:54:04.216]  And I speak to the hearts of people in the government, in the technocracy, in the enforcement arms.
[02:54:04.236 --> 02:54:05.116]  You know this is true.
[02:54:05.576 --> 02:54:06.777]  Please join us in liberty.
[02:54:07.117 --> 02:54:07.657]  Get the videos.
[02:54:07.677 --> 02:54:07.737]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:54:07.757 --> 02:54:10.197]  David in Illinois, then Maryland.
[02:54:10.217 --> 02:54:11.178]  Go ahead Dave.
[02:54:11.198 --> 02:54:11.538]  Hi Alex.
[02:54:17.694 --> 02:54:24.478]  Um, I'm on the Illinois side of the Quad Cities and my family had a similar kind of thing.
[02:54:24.938 --> 02:54:28.280]  My dad, he tried to get help from the VA hospital and they wouldn't let him.
[02:54:28.340 --> 02:54:34.923]  He had to go to the state representative and he finally got the surgery after the state representative told him to help my dad.
[02:54:35.904 --> 02:54:38.345]  And then, um, he died a year later.
[02:54:38.385 --> 02:54:43.388]  My mom thought that they cut out the wrong kidney and they wouldn't give the medical records.
[02:54:44.771 --> 02:54:45.712]  Well, that's another thing.
[02:54:45.812 --> 02:54:48.673]  I wouldn't want their medical care, but some people have got to have it.
[02:54:48.693 --> 02:54:50.915]  They have like demons working there, not all of them.
[02:54:51.555 --> 02:54:55.037]  And now you complain, don't even threaten them, they send Homeland Security to arrest you.
[02:54:55.437 --> 02:54:59.520]  Yeah, and like the doctor was saying, how he was having trouble with the lawyers.
[02:55:00.380 --> 02:55:02.641]  The lawyers around here won't take the case.
[02:55:03.002 --> 02:55:08.885]  Me and my mom, we met this lady, we were at the graveyard putting flowers on graves.
[02:55:09.395 --> 02:55:16.259]  And, um, she was there and she had a twenty-something-year-old son who died from, uh, a Davenport hospital.
[02:55:16.319 --> 02:55:17.700]  It's another city in the Quad Cities.
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:36.089]  And, um, basically, uh, she told us that, uh, you know, she, she got fed up, went to Chicago to get a lawyer, and a Chicago lawyer told her that, um, all, all our, our courts are pretty much tied up with, uh, you know, the medical community and, and we'll, we'd never win a case here.
[02:55:36.670 --> 02:55:36.930]  And, um,
[02:55:37.478 --> 02:55:41.640]  You know, I don't want to be a naysayer or anything, but that's the kind of thing we're dealing with here.
[02:55:41.660 --> 02:55:43.501]  Well, I'm sorry to hear about your father.
[02:55:43.721 --> 02:55:44.361]  God bless you.
[02:55:44.381 --> 02:55:46.282]  Marilyn, you're on the air.
[02:55:46.342 --> 02:55:46.963]  Last caller.
[02:55:46.983 --> 02:55:47.683]  Go ahead, Marilyn.
[02:55:48.783 --> 02:56:04.291]  I wonder if you've pondered the possibility that the trade-off for an amendment to allow Schwarzenegger to run for president may be to insert the word consecutive into the two-term limit on the presidency.
[02:56:05.954 --> 02:56:10.557]  In a Constitutional Convention, they can change the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, everything.
[02:56:12.018 --> 02:56:22.544]  Well, since Hillary can't win the Presidency, Democrats who don't know any better might, uh, might go for this trade-off to allow Bill Clinton to run again.
[02:56:24.325 --> 02:56:28.067]  Bill Clinton, they say, he even says, already has a Secretary of Generalship.
[02:56:29.188 --> 02:56:29.488]  Uh-huh.
[02:56:29.728 --> 02:56:30.469]  But good points.
[02:56:30.529 --> 02:56:32.870]  Call me back tomorrow, we'll be back tonight, and then back tomorrow.
[02:56:33.110 --> 02:56:33.590]  God bless.
[02:56:33.650 --> 02:56:34.051]  Take care.
[02:56:36.035 --> 02:56:36.494]  Hello, folk!
