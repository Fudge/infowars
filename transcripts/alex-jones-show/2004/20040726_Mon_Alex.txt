[00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:06.347]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.068]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:09.889]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:11.410]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.991]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:17.554]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.854 --> 00:00:21.997]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.441]  Well, my friends, it's already the 26th day
[00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:38.223]  And I'm glad that you've joined us on this Monday edition, again, July 26, 2004.
[00:00:38.883 --> 00:00:48.726]  On this Monday, the websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:00:50.447 --> 00:00:51.887]  Big broadcast lined up.
[00:00:52.027 --> 00:00:53.488]  There's just so much news.
[00:00:53.508 --> 00:00:56.669]  We've got three guests coming up, and wide open telephones.
[00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:00.830]  But after the first break, in the second segment, I've got a story to tell you.
[00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:05.459]  I am very lucky to be alive after what happened last night.
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.881]  To put it mildly, we drove through a tornado.
[00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:13.402]  And I didn't know it at the time.
[00:01:14.943 --> 00:01:18.184]  And my truck is totaled.
[00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:23.966]  But I tell you, we came out of it almost without a scratch.
[00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.527]  It was just me and my father driving back from seeing my uncle.
[00:01:31.312 --> 00:01:36.258]  We slowed down about 45-50 miles an hour because it was raining hard off and on.
[00:01:36.278 --> 00:01:36.978]  The wind was high.
[00:01:37.018 --> 00:01:39.681]  We're about to pull over.
[00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:42.384]  I'll tell you the story coming up.
[00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:52.515]  But it feeds into just everyday life and the nature of the world and the facts of life and death and how fragile life is.
[00:01:55.396 --> 00:02:21.308]  and uh... how dangerous it is to be out driving on the highways period much less when uh... there's a flash tornado go from blue skies in about twenty minutes to pouring down rain in a tornado but uh... fbi probes report group planning convention attack and again the group planning this is domestic and of course it's one of the little anarchist groups which we know are hired thugs of the government
[00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:35.203]  In my Police State 2 film, Police State 2 The Takeover, I have video of police admitting that they were hired by the government, housed by the government, protected by the government in Seattle.
[00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:44.466]  And they've been hired around the country to go out and create a crisis so the black ski mask ninja Darth Vader police can attack them.
[00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:48.728]  And they are Homeland Security helicopters, U.S.
[00:02:48.888 --> 00:02:50.909]  Army troops, National Guard,
[00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:57.496]  You've got state police, local police training you how to be a slave.
[00:02:57.536 --> 00:02:58.657]  That's all this is about.
[00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:00.637]  That's exactly what's happening here.
[00:03:01.717 --> 00:03:10.320]  So we'll get into that and we've got some guests coming on who took photos that the press hasn't shown you in detail of these protester cages.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.582]  A bunch of them are under a train station at basement level where no one can see them in barbed wire cages.
[00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:22.733]  And the media is not allowed down to interview them.
[00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:25.415]  So your new freedom is actually in a cage.
[00:03:27.756 --> 00:03:29.557]  So we'll cover that report as well.
[00:03:29.617 --> 00:03:36.261]  And I've talked about how they're going to make us take vaccines that will change our brain makeup, that will change our attitudes and behavior.
[00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:46.186]  There have been discussions of doing a blood test and if you have DNA that shows you might be aggressive in life, by law they're going to give you a shot that changes your brain chemistry.
[00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:47.787]  Deadly stuff.
[00:03:48.703 --> 00:03:52.265]  They're already doing that with many vaccines, by the way, that just reduce IQ in the general public.
[00:03:52.686 --> 00:03:55.888]  But this is out of the mainstream news, my friends.
[00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.430]  And it says they're going to make children take it.
[00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.253]  Children to get jabs against drug addiction.
[00:04:03.853 --> 00:04:04.633]  London Independent.
[00:04:05.354 --> 00:04:11.518]  Ministers consider vaccination scheme, heroin, cocaine, and nicotine targeted, that change the brain chemistry
[00:04:12.153 --> 00:04:15.016]  To where you cannot be receptive to these.
[00:04:15.076 --> 00:04:21.061]  Of course, it will also block your natural endorphins and make you a very unhappy, depressed person and alter your brain.
[00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:22.703]  But, hey, it's all part of freedom!
[00:04:22.723 --> 00:04:24.765]  You know, injecting you to change your brain chemistry.
[00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:27.487]  So, we'll get into that as well.
[00:04:27.528 --> 00:04:29.810]  There's just so much coming up.
[00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.113]  The new passports to have trackable microchips in them.
[00:04:34.984 --> 00:04:39.828]  And again, just so much more, but I'll briefly tell you the story of what happened last night.
[00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:41.549]  I am blessed to be here.
[00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.390]  I thank God.
[00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.771]  I thank Yahweh.
[00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:50.036]  I thank Jesus that we're alive because it was amazing.
[00:04:50.777 --> 00:04:52.759]  And I'll tell you the story when we get back.
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.560]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.221]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:01.224 --> 00:05:05.568]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:10.093]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.

[00:05:31.485 --> 00:05:41.929]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:47.571]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.481]  Terrorism!
[00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:02.401]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.521 --> 00:06:08.585]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:08.845 --> 00:06:10.446]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:13.148]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.548 --> 00:06:28.117]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.157 --> 00:06:28.477]  government.

[00:07:02.988 --> 00:07:06.330]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.651]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:14.774]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[00:07:14.994 --> 00:07:17.575]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[00:07:17.815 --> 00:07:18.476]  Nothing escapes!
[00:07:18.596 --> 00:07:22.838]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[00:07:22.998 --> 00:07:26.620]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.961]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone!
[00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:29.521]  Smoke?
[00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:31.643]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[00:07:31.803 --> 00:07:34.865]  Our BioZone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[00:07:35.105 --> 00:07:39.208]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your BioZone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[00:07:39.368 --> 00:07:42.030]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.
[00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.972]  Call toll-free, 888-88-MY-AIR today.
[00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:47.433]  That's 1-888-88-MY-AIR.

[00:08:05.845 --> 00:08:06.505]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.165 --> 00:08:08.226]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:10.087]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.687 --> 00:08:11.528]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.248 --> 00:08:13.169]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:17.511]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.011 --> 00:08:22.114]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.908 --> 00:08:30.432]  All right, my friends, it is Monday, the 26th day of July, 2004.
[00:08:30.492 --> 00:08:31.833]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:32.774 --> 00:08:34.295]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:36.977 --> 00:08:38.318]  I am lucky to be alive.
[00:08:38.338 --> 00:08:41.220]  Blessed to be alive is the proper term.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:55.332]  I haven't had a car wreck in many years, and my wife and mother drove in my wife's car, and I drove in my truck out to Fredericksburg, Texas for my uncle's
[00:08:56.528 --> 00:09:01.109]  Birthday yesterday, and we were driving back.
[00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:12.693]  We were going to stay later, but we saw this giant storm rolling across the hills and mountains of, you know, out there in the hill country, and it was moving really fast.
[00:09:12.793 --> 00:09:17.014]  It traveled about 15 miles in about 30 minutes.
[00:09:17.035 --> 00:09:24.797]  We could see it off at a distance, and we got caught by it, and then other storms developed, and as we got into the edge of Johnson City,
[00:09:25.643 --> 00:09:25.963]  Out on 290.
[00:09:27.644 --> 00:09:28.964]  You're saying, why are you telling the story?
[00:09:28.984 --> 00:09:30.125]  Well, you'll hear why.
[00:09:31.786 --> 00:09:36.587]  We're driving along, and other cars are driving about 65 down the 70 mile an hour highway.
[00:09:36.607 --> 00:09:38.728]  My dad says, you might want to slow down.
[00:09:38.768 --> 00:09:40.229]  This looks like really bad weather.
[00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:45.251]  And you would drive into torrential sheets of rain where you could barely see in front of your car.
[00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:46.311]  Then it would get clear.
[00:09:46.331 --> 00:09:55.215]  And we're driving along, and then all of a sudden, the vehicle just spins twice, flies off the highway, down the embankment, my Tahoe,
[00:09:57.296 --> 00:10:03.179]  Down the gully into two huge oak trees and crushes about four or five feet of the car in.
[00:10:03.199 --> 00:10:16.505]  And, uh, I mean, the shock was so powerful into the back of the vehicle that the ceiling of the car fell in, despite the fact that it wasn't even struck by the trees.
[00:10:18.271 --> 00:10:21.513]  And as we're flying off the highway, I told my dad, brace for impact.
[00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:22.373]  It was like a movie.
[00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:24.074]  You're about to crash your plane.
[00:10:24.114 --> 00:10:25.494]  All I said was, brace for impact!
[00:10:26.215 --> 00:10:29.796]  And we hit so hard that the steering wheel broke in my hands.
[00:10:30.737 --> 00:10:32.718]  The steering column just smashed in.
[00:10:33.798 --> 00:10:41.702]  And there we were, about 20 feet off the side of the road, backed into these oak trees.
[00:10:43.547 --> 00:10:47.190]  And then I climbed out of the vehicle, walked up to the side of the highway.
[00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.632]  The fire ants, when it rains, all come out of the ground and climb up to the top of the grass.
[00:10:50.652 --> 00:10:52.413]  I've got fire ants all over my feet.
[00:10:52.493 --> 00:11:12.707]  But we are so blessed that we were not killed, because if we would have hit the trees side-on, I mean, it crushed in four or five feet at the back, straight on the back and on one of the sides, and knocked out all the windows in the back and the sides, that it probably would have really hurt one of us or killed one of us.
[00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:15.844]  And my dad thought he was okay.
[00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:18.606]  He was going to take me to get a rent car early this morning.
[00:11:19.006 --> 00:11:22.268]  He started a week-long vacation today, so he could do it.
[00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:26.571]  He lives down the road from me, and I called this morning and said, hey dad, you're not here at 8 o'clock.
[00:11:26.631 --> 00:11:29.893]  And he said, while I was up all night, I had a concussion.
[00:11:29.933 --> 00:11:31.754]  And my dad's, you know, got a medical degree.
[00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:33.295]  He's a doctor, so he knows these things.
[00:11:33.795 --> 00:11:36.877]  His pupils were different sizes, and he was throwing up all night.
[00:11:37.638 --> 00:11:39.799]  I got a headache and a neck ache out of it.
[00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:42.661]  I may have a concussion, but just still.
[00:11:43.635 --> 00:11:45.697]  Thank God we're not dead.
[00:11:46.558 --> 00:11:48.079]  But we got blown off the road.
[00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:50.060]  I thought maybe we hydroplaned or got blown off.
[00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:50.561]  I didn't know.
[00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:51.942]  But then the state police pulled up.
[00:11:52.282 --> 00:11:53.183]  Two different cars.
[00:11:53.423 --> 00:11:54.424]  Really nice guys.
[00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:58.207]  One of them is a fan of the radio show and listens to it.
[00:11:59.208 --> 00:12:04.212]  And the other one, I knew who I was, but hadn't heard the show.
[00:12:04.773 --> 00:12:05.513]  So nice.
[00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:10.017]  I mean, they were out there in the driving rain with lightning blowing trees up nearby.
[00:12:10.057 --> 00:12:11.859]  I mean, this was really scary weather.
[00:12:12.652 --> 00:12:18.074]  And, uh, they, uh, you know, gave us some towels and helped us because the vehicle had the windows knocked out and was pouring rain.
[00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:22.516]  And just, just, you know, that's the type of officers we need.
[00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:23.716]  Just like firefighters.
[00:12:23.816 --> 00:12:27.017]  A firefighter stopped and he was the first to stop and help us.
[00:12:27.778 --> 00:12:28.338]  But, uh,
[00:12:30.043 --> 00:12:36.590]  Then I'm sitting there in the police radio, and they go, yeah, we just got hit by a good-sized tornado in Johnson City.
[00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:37.671]  That's three miles ahead.
[00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:42.076]  And they said it was coming from the direction of Fredericksburg and tore up some trees.
[00:12:42.537 --> 00:12:46.020]  And driving in, we noticed some trees were down and parts of trees in the road.
[00:12:46.941 --> 00:12:49.064]  Other cars were just driving 65 miles an hour.
[00:12:49.104 --> 00:12:49.965]  They were going around us.
[00:12:50.085 --> 00:12:50.966]  I had slowed down.
[00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:54.613]  Which, in a way, might have actually got us caught in a tornado.
[00:12:54.953 --> 00:12:58.996]  Because we were about two, three miles outside Johnson City where the tornado, we found out, had touched down.
[00:12:59.316 --> 00:13:01.017]  Then it touched down again in town.
[00:13:01.357 --> 00:13:02.518]  Power was off in town.
[00:13:02.618 --> 00:13:03.579]  Power lines down.
[00:13:03.939 --> 00:13:05.160]  Tore up a couple houses.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.342]  Overturned some cars, we found out.
[00:13:09.202 --> 00:13:19.129]  And so, I believe it was high winds from the tornado or from a funnel that literally, because, you know, I've hydroplaned before and the water wasn't that deep where we were at.
[00:13:20.396 --> 00:13:22.477]  And I was going slow enough to not hydroplane.
[00:13:22.497 --> 00:13:30.159]  I mean, the car just literally spun, got almost picked up, it felt like, and thrown off the highway into these oak trees.
[00:13:31.259 --> 00:13:36.441]  So, that's the story, and God, thank you for your protection.
[00:13:38.135 --> 00:13:40.597]  Who knows if that wouldn't have happened.
[00:13:41.118 --> 00:13:46.704]  The tornado hit the middle of town a few minutes later, I might have been hit by the tornado that hit cars in town.
[00:13:47.184 --> 00:13:50.488]  People barely got out of some of their cars because the flooding in town was so bad.
[00:13:50.508 --> 00:13:54.131]  In fact, I heard firefighters on the radio going, they're barely getting out!
[00:13:54.372 --> 00:13:55.773]  Water just overtook the vehicle!
[00:13:56.214 --> 00:13:57.515]  My God, they may be in the vehicle!
[00:13:57.555 --> 00:13:58.036]  Get over!
[00:13:58.196 --> 00:13:58.776]  They got out!
[00:13:58.836 --> 00:13:59.117]  Good!
[00:13:59.577 --> 00:14:02.220]  I mean, this is what I was hearing on the radios inside the police car.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.622]  And they were saying, man, you're really lucky to be alive.
[00:14:04.642 --> 00:14:08.746]  If that would have hit the side of your vehicle, you'd be dead or injured really bad.
[00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:16.153]  Because again, the back of the truck, steel bumper, everything of the Tahoe was smashed in almost up to the back seats.
[00:14:17.695 --> 00:14:22.820]  And then another tree hit on the side of the back panel and crushed the whole door in.
[00:14:24.457 --> 00:14:25.818]  But we instantly stopped.
[00:14:25.858 --> 00:14:28.080]  I mean, we hit that thing and just BAM!
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:33.123]  And I thought we got away completely scot-free, minus the fire ant bites.
[00:14:34.244 --> 00:14:37.887]  Because they were very angry that we had plowed through their home.
[00:14:37.907 --> 00:14:40.989]  These horrible Brazilian ants we have down here.
[00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.672]  Still away from Brazil back in the fifties.
[00:14:45.332 --> 00:14:49.996]  But I probably got literally fifty fire ant bites.
[00:14:50.036 --> 00:14:51.397]  My feet are swollen up in red.
[00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:53.721]  I hope my dad's going to be alright.
[00:14:53.741 --> 00:14:54.442]  I'm sure he is.
[00:14:54.502 --> 00:14:56.062]  He's out taking care of business today.
[00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:58.143]  Concussion.
[00:14:58.863 --> 00:15:01.824]  Up all night throwing up with his people's different sizes.
[00:15:02.605 --> 00:15:04.005]  A bruise on the brain.
[00:15:05.686 --> 00:15:07.867]  I guess I didn't get a concussion, though I do have a headache.
[00:15:11.308 --> 00:15:14.529]  All the time I talk about how you can
[00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.156]  Die in a minute.
[00:15:16.357 --> 00:15:18.338]  You can fall down the stairs, break your neck.
[00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:23.341]  The number one cause of death in this country, below the age of 55, is an automobile accident.
[00:15:23.761 --> 00:15:28.844]  What is it, like 400,000, 390,000 people die a year in cars?
[00:15:30.945 --> 00:15:33.566]  I think it's like 12 times what die from guns.
[00:15:34.607 --> 00:15:36.588]  I think 10 times what die from grounding.
[00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:44.953]  But literally, leaving my uncles, we saw a tree get blown up by lightning 200 yards from us.
[00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:53.569]  Then we're driving down the road, 30 miles later by Johnson City, and see lightning hitting trees.
[00:15:53.589 --> 00:16:01.094]  I mean, this was wild weather, because it was broad daylight at 630 when we left his house, with the storm coming.
[00:16:01.114 --> 00:16:04.496]  And it was dark black once we went into the storm.
[00:16:05.736 --> 00:16:07.097]  And it just happened so quickly.
[00:16:07.137 --> 00:16:09.018]  But, you know, I talk about that all the time.
[00:16:09.778 --> 00:16:11.860]  You're afraid to fight the New World Order.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.121]  Oh, they might come get you.
[00:16:14.915 --> 00:16:15.996]  You're afraid to speak up.
[00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:19.619]  Your neighbors might think you're weird or, you know, have bizarre ideas.
[00:16:20.119 --> 00:16:21.440]  But you'll get in your car.
[00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:28.066]  You'll give your 16-year-old son or daughter, with almost no training, this is where I believe there should be more training, an automobile.
[00:16:29.193 --> 00:16:32.534]  And statistically, that's where most of the deaths come from, is people 16 to 18.
[00:16:32.654 --> 00:16:37.554]  I mean, I haven't had a wreck since I was a teenager, and I had a few bad wrecks.
[00:16:37.634 --> 00:16:43.876]  And frankly, in hindsight, I don't think I'm going to let my children have automobiles until they're 20.
[00:16:45.056 --> 00:16:54.417]  Of course, they're not going to listen to that, but I'm going to make them go through just, I don't know, maybe send them to Germany for their driver's test or something, where it's more intensive.
[00:16:55.037 --> 00:16:57.818]  But by and large, I'm a good driver.
[00:16:58.829 --> 00:17:03.590]  And, uh, you know, I defensively drive, but I guess there's nothing you can do when the tornado hits you.
[00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:07.671]  And the police seem to believe that we were hit by the tornado.
[00:17:08.391 --> 00:17:12.552]  Because they looked at the... what happened, and there were really no skid marks on the highway.
[00:17:12.572 --> 00:17:19.133]  It was like the car was... All I know is the car was spinning around in circles and felt like it was off the ground and then thrown into trees.
[00:17:20.374 --> 00:17:24.135]  So, I know there was a tornado touching down at that very time.
[00:17:25.175 --> 00:17:25.795]  Uh, so...
[00:17:28.001 --> 00:17:31.122]  Again, my friends, you never know when it's your time.
[00:17:31.462 --> 00:17:36.624]  Life is so fragile, so beautiful, so special.
[00:17:38.744 --> 00:17:42.405]  We take these risks to own automobiles, and I think those risks are worth it.
[00:17:43.345 --> 00:17:46.726]  But at the same time, until you're 55, then it's heart attacks and cancer.
[00:17:47.087 --> 00:17:49.767]  The number one thing in your life to worry about is your automobile.
[00:17:53.081 --> 00:17:54.922]  So I ask you a psychological question.
[00:17:55.222 --> 00:18:10.629]  Why do you get in your truck or car, and not worry about it, and get out there on the interstate highway driving 70 miles an hour, with all this steel and aluminum and concrete around you, and not worry, but then you're afraid that the men in black ski masks are going to come get you if you fight corruption?
[00:18:12.349 --> 00:18:14.310]  I mean, look, life is a battlefield.
[00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:20.773]  Life is so short, and you might as well live it well, and live it with good morals, and stand up against evil.
[00:18:22.725 --> 00:18:25.208]  Because when it's your time, it's your time.
[00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:32.176]  I mean, I had high winds, probably a tornado, pick me up and throw me off the highway like a matchbox.
[00:18:33.918 --> 00:18:39.484]  And I'm still here, just because God wants me to still be here.
[00:18:39.745 --> 00:18:42.468]  And the moment God doesn't want me to be here, I won't be here anymore.
[00:18:44.517 --> 00:18:49.979]  And so, kiss your wife, kiss your husband, hug your children, you know, call your grandma, tell her that you love her.
[00:18:50.019 --> 00:18:56.301]  And I'm always talking like this, because I realize how short life is, and how special and fleeting it is.
[00:18:57.182 --> 00:19:03.764]  But, I mean, even more, just realize that you're not going to be able to hang on to it.
[00:19:04.505 --> 00:19:08.506]  You're going to die someday, so you might as well get over it and accept it.
[00:19:09.086 --> 00:19:10.787]  And I tell you, you know how when you're
[00:19:11.585 --> 00:19:15.227]  Got your adrenaline flowing and you're in a life-and-death situation and your brain knows it.
[00:19:16.308 --> 00:19:34.138]  When my car was picked up flying off that embankment down towards those huge oak trees, I just looked over at my father and I said, brace yourself for impact and I looked at him and I loved him so much and my only concern was God, and I remember thinking this, please don't let my dad die.
[00:19:34.258 --> 00:19:36.180]  Take me, but don't take my dad.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.381]  I just looked at him there
[00:19:39.153 --> 00:19:45.655]  And I said, brace for impact, and I watched him tense, and then I turned and hit so hard that the steering wheel broke, folks.
[00:19:46.656 --> 00:19:48.236]  And I'm not even hurt!
[00:19:49.437 --> 00:19:50.037]  Amazing!
[00:19:51.157 --> 00:19:51.438]  Wow.
[00:19:52.138 --> 00:19:56.599]  Alright, we'll get into all the news, and believe me, there's a lot of it when we get back, and we'll take your calls.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:57.860]  Please stay with us.
[00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:06.246]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:06.607 --> 00:20:10.711]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:10.991 --> 00:20:11.552]  We listened.
[00:20:11.852 --> 00:20:16.838]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:17.118 --> 00:20:17.579]  We listened.
[00:20:17.959 --> 00:20:21.002]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:21.443 --> 00:20:21.963]  We listened.
[00:20:22.444 --> 00:20:26.508]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:20:26.889 --> 00:20:27.369]  We listened.
[00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:32.955]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:33.636]  Again,
[00:20:34.176 --> 00:20:34.716]  We listened.
[00:20:35.076 --> 00:20:42.458]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:20:42.838 --> 00:20:47.339]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:48.099]  That's toll free, triple 8, 803-4438.
[00:20:48.139 --> 00:20:49.120]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:00.444 --> 00:21:02.785]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:21:03.045 --> 00:21:06.886]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:21:07.206 --> 00:21:08.007]  Read the labels.
[00:21:08.447 --> 00:21:12.588]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:16.990]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:22.232]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:21:22.612 --> 00:21:26.195]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:31.720]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.742]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:21:35.023 --> 00:21:35.923]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:22:00.942 --> 00:22:03.143]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:07.945]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:22:08.205 --> 00:22:14.007]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:22:14.247 --> 00:22:18.309]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:22:18.589 --> 00:22:24.231]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[00:22:24.351 --> 00:22:26.952]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:22:29.053 --> 00:22:32.954]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[00:22:32.994 --> 00:22:35.375]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:22:35.715 --> 00:22:38.016]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:42.037]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:22:42.497 --> 00:22:48.699]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:50.140]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:50.800]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.000]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.255 --> 00:23:04.357]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[00:23:04.657 --> 00:23:06.778]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[00:23:07.298 --> 00:23:11.899]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[00:23:12.219 --> 00:23:13.600]  It actually works.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.401]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:23:17.461 --> 00:23:18.982]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:23:19.142 --> 00:23:21.383]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenated.
[00:23:21.763 --> 00:23:25.104]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[00:23:25.791 --> 00:23:26.412]  It truly works.
[00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:27.954]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:23:28.374 --> 00:23:34.121]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:23:34.181 --> 00:23:40.008]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:42.732]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[00:23:43.092 --> 00:23:44.113]  It's healthy for you, too.
[00:23:44.313 --> 00:23:45.313]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:23:45.333 --> 00:23:45.593]  1-800-622-FIN.
[00:23:45.654 --> 00:23:45.874]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:23:45.934 --> 00:23:47.194]  Get $25 off a 3-month supply of collagenate.
[00:23:47.214 --> 00:23:47.715]  So call now.
[00:23:47.735 --> 00:23:47.855]  1-800-622-FIN.
[00:23:47.875 --> 00:23:48.115]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:13.581]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2.
[00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:16.403]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:24:16.423 --> 00:24:17.563]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24:19.445 --> 00:24:27.350]  We've got three different groups of people coming on live from the Democratic National Convention in Boston, Mass.
[00:24:28.471 --> 00:24:30.132]  Starting in the middle of the next hour.
[00:24:32.174 --> 00:24:35.096]  And I'm sure a lot of you watch it on television.
[00:24:35.416 --> 00:24:36.617]  It is indescribable.
[00:24:37.418 --> 00:24:47.308]  Black Homeland Security, Black Hawks flying around, Regular Army, National Guard, police in federally issued black combat outfits with body armor.
[00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:59.980]  And they have cages built underneath the train station, a half mile away from the convention center, where no one will see them.
[00:25:01.235 --> 00:25:03.697]  And you'd see these photos at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:03.737 --> 00:25:07.121]  For some reason, Murphy's Law, the site is rarely down.
[00:25:07.181 --> 00:25:10.083]  It is down right now, I'm told.
[00:25:10.163 --> 00:25:13.687]  We've been having that happen lately in the denial of service type stuff.
[00:25:14.768 --> 00:25:19.992]  But, you know, where you get a couple million hits in a few seconds, that's not normal.
[00:25:20.052 --> 00:25:22.014]  That's something doing that.
[00:25:23.035 --> 00:25:25.858]  But you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:26.979]  It's on its own server.
[00:25:27.845 --> 00:25:31.027]  And look at a lot of this news, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:25:32.689 --> 00:25:35.410]  And we're about to set up InfoWars.net in the next two weeks.
[00:25:35.771 --> 00:25:42.656]  I mean, it's set up now for years, but we'll revamp it and it's going to be its own mirror site as well with daily updates of news.
[00:25:44.337 --> 00:25:54.304]  But you can go to websites like CPR4Democracy.com and look at photos where underground
[00:25:55.131 --> 00:26:01.413]  They have cages where the people are locked in cages, I'm not kidding, by the police.
[00:26:01.853 --> 00:26:11.196]  What the news shows you is the barbed wire fences that contain the convention center itself and go, oh, the protesters are behind these cages.
[00:26:11.716 --> 00:26:19.799]  No, the protesters are actually inside small cages that are behind those fences.
[00:26:21.717 --> 00:26:29.087]  And the police are saying, oh, we're looking for some type of anarchist group to attack again.
[00:26:29.127 --> 00:26:31.050]  And of course, just like in D.C.
[00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:35.516]  or at the WTO meeting in Miami or Seattle in 99,
[00:26:37.487 --> 00:26:40.429]  Or, what happened in Genoa, Italy a few years ago.
[00:26:40.589 --> 00:26:46.694]  In every case, these guys show up, burn trash cans, throw them all off cocktails at police cars.
[00:26:47.214 --> 00:26:49.496]  The police sit there and take it, or order it to.
[00:26:49.516 --> 00:26:51.998]  We have this on video, in my film, The Takeover.
[00:26:52.618 --> 00:26:59.884]  Then the anarchists are housed in a government building, protected by the government, and openly we have police admitting they work for the government.
[00:27:00.824 --> 00:27:04.567]  But it'll be in the local newspaper, never in the national newspaper.
[00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:11.972]  And so then this lets them say, see, the protests are bad.
[00:27:12.012 --> 00:27:21.276]  We've got to ban protests, or have protest zones, or issue more of these black helmets and black body armor and rubber bullets to the police to deal with terrorists.
[00:27:21.336 --> 00:27:25.078]  And now they've got army troops with M-60 machine guns.
[00:27:26.018 --> 00:27:29.760]  Heavy machine guns, folks, pointing down at the crowds.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.621]  I mean, what does this do to stop terrorists?
[00:27:34.182 --> 00:27:35.883]  And again, who are the terrorists?
[00:27:35.903 --> 00:27:42.025]  You look at who engineered 9-11, you look at who carried out September 11th, you look at who's behind the terror attacks.
[00:27:42.745 --> 00:27:50.208]  We have the official government plans to carry out terror attacks and blame it on enemies and be used as a pretext for a police state crackdown here domestically.
[00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:54.270]  They say the terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.831]  So I guess the government's going to get rid of our freedom, then the terrorists won't want to attack us.
[00:27:59.558 --> 00:28:02.482]  And it's just horrible to watch this unfold.
[00:28:02.622 --> 00:28:03.443]  What do you think about it?
[00:28:03.463 --> 00:28:03.904]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:28:04.104 --> 00:28:18.802]  The FBI said on Friday it was probing unconfirmed information, always unconfirmed, that a domestic group is planning to disrupt next week's Democratic National Convention by attacking media vehicles with explosives or incendiary devices.
[00:28:19.577 --> 00:28:29.625]  The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Boston Field Office said in a statement that members of the Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force were looking into that matter and that it would release more details if there's any credible information.
[00:28:31.286 --> 00:28:33.888]  And they think it's a domestic group, perhaps anarchists.
[00:28:34.268 --> 00:28:38.872]  And every time they say anarchists, that's government crisis creators.
[00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:47.335]  Meanwhile, Homeland Security officer charged in tourist beating Buffalo, New York, NBC3.
[00:28:47.355 --> 00:28:58.304]  A Homeland Security inspector is charged with violating a Chinese tourist's civil rights at a border crossing in Buffalo after the altercation left the innocent woman's eyes nearly swollen shut.
[00:28:59.031 --> 00:29:09.220]  The incident occurred late Wednesday at the Rainbow Bridge on the U.S.-Canadian border in Niagara Falls after Customs and Border Protection officers confiscated marijuana from a male pedestrian.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:17.006]  Witnesses say the officer, Robert Rose, mistakenly believed the woman standing nearby was involved, sprayed her with pepper spray and threw her against a wall.
[00:29:17.447 --> 00:29:22.171]  They say he kneed her in the head as she knelt on the ground.
[00:29:22.231 --> 00:29:23.372]  Yeah, they sit on your head.
[00:29:24.032 --> 00:29:26.593]  And struck her head on the ground while holding her hair.
[00:29:26.653 --> 00:29:28.974]  The woman had bumps and bruises on her face and head.
[00:29:31.295 --> 00:29:35.917]  And, uh, turns out that he tried to lie, but other cops said no.
[00:29:36.217 --> 00:29:37.817]  He really did attack her for no reason.
[00:29:37.877 --> 00:29:41.919]  So, good cops are now ensuring this thug is in trouble.
[00:29:41.979 --> 00:29:42.259]  Good!
[00:29:42.319 --> 00:29:42.819]  Good job!
[00:29:43.759 --> 00:29:44.360]  Poor woman.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.500]  Alright, the really big news is coming up.

[00:32:56.865 --> 00:33:07.507]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.207 --> 00:33:10.588]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:14.228 --> 00:33:21.370]  Okay my friends, coming up in an hour we're having three different groups on who are
[00:33:22.407 --> 00:33:41.135]  At the Democratic National Convention, out in Boston, to talk about the military loaded machine guns aimed at people, the protesters confined to cages, in some cases that are in underground facilities where no one can even see them.
[00:33:41.775 --> 00:33:45.997]  I mean folks, this is just unbelievable, the stuff that's going on.
[00:33:46.989 --> 00:33:49.150]  I know that we've also got a lot of callers that are holding.
[00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:50.350]  We'll get to you as well.
[00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:57.033]  I've got news about vaccines that change your brain chemistry so you, quote, can't get addicted to drugs.
[00:33:57.753 --> 00:33:59.674]  Very, very serious information.
[00:34:00.254 --> 00:34:12.218]  A lot of news about how they want to make the digital passports now have a trackable RFID long-distance chip in them with a large antenna woven into the card itself.
[00:34:13.587 --> 00:34:16.992]  That can be picked up from hundreds of yards away to be tracked and traced.
[00:34:17.592 --> 00:34:19.575]  Just a plethora of news.
[00:34:20.476 --> 00:34:30.429]  Briefly, I'd like to invite all the listeners to visit PrisonPlanet.tv and to click through our secure, safe online shopping cart.
[00:34:31.227 --> 00:34:45.340]  And to look at the videos I've produced, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror, to tell who was really behind September 11th, the military-industrial complex, and the impossibility of the official story we've been told.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:50.605]  We know the official story is a lie, we know the government had prior knowledge, and was involved.
[00:34:51.861 --> 00:34:54.805]  Also, we carry George Humphrey's new video about 9-11.
[00:34:54.825 --> 00:34:58.228]  9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[00:34:58.769 --> 00:35:01.552]  Eric Hopschmid's video on VHS and DVD.
[00:35:01.572 --> 00:35:03.034]  9-11, Painful Deceptions.
[00:35:05.848 --> 00:35:11.852]  So I've got four different films on 9-11, two of mine and one of George Humphrey and one of Eric Huffschmid's.
[00:35:12.132 --> 00:35:16.875]  The best videos I've seen out there, bar none folks, and I encourage all of you to get them.
[00:35:17.356 --> 00:35:23.420]  Big discounts when you get three or more of any of my ten films or the other videos that are out there.
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.483]  The total free number to get the videos is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:26.503 --> 00:35:26.843]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:26.923 --> 00:35:32.109]  The videos are $25.95 apiece, and they're $20 if you order 3 or more of any of the 10 titles.
[00:35:45.741 --> 00:35:52.186]  Also, like with George Humphrey's video, you get a free color book, 80 plus page booklet with it about 9-11.
[00:35:52.646 --> 00:35:55.748]  You get a second copy for $14.95 and three booklets.
[00:35:56.109 --> 00:36:00.092]  So that's three booklets and two videos or DVDs for $34.95.
[00:36:00.132 --> 00:36:06.617]  We've got a lot of other different specials with the books and books on tape and other films that we carry.
[00:36:06.637 --> 00:36:09.479]  If you want to call and ask the operators about it,
[00:36:10.299 --> 00:36:11.140]  Or different specials.
[00:36:11.601 --> 00:36:17.428]  The toll-free number again is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.574]  And of course, you can also order via our SafeSecure shopping cart.
[00:36:22.934 --> 00:36:27.380]  PrisonPlanet.tv links through to that Yahoo shopping cart.
[00:36:28.573 --> 00:36:35.057]  Now, I know we've got loaded phone lines and a bunch of news to get to, and I met this man about a month and a half ago.
[00:36:35.137 --> 00:36:38.819]  He sent me his resume, documents, you name it.
[00:36:38.979 --> 00:36:43.441]  Very articulate, great individual, freedom lover, very astute.
[00:36:44.422 --> 00:36:47.283]  He's one of those folks, you talk to him, you know he knows what he's talking about.
[00:36:47.764 --> 00:36:55.508]  Richard Franklin, and he was in the military, a military air traffic controller assigned to the FAA in civilian towers.
[00:36:56.443 --> 00:37:04.108]  And he can lay it out for you real quick, the impossibility of the stand-down with NORAD.
[00:37:04.149 --> 00:37:05.449]  That had to be on purpose.
[00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:13.975]  And what happened with the air traffic controllers, and we're going to have him on for the next 15 minutes or so, but we're also going to get into other news with him and take your calls.
[00:37:14.516 --> 00:37:17.438]  And Mr. Franklin, I am honored to have you on with us today, sir.
[00:37:17.938 --> 00:37:19.099]  Well, I'm glad to talk to you.
[00:37:19.219 --> 00:37:20.240]  I appreciate it.
[00:37:21.745 --> 00:37:29.449]  Tell us just a little bit about yourself, and then basically we should have the conversation that we had at that Truth Seekers meeting a month and a half ago.
[00:37:30.409 --> 00:37:40.274]  Yeah, the whole 9-11 premise bothered me when I first heard about it, knowing having been an air traffic controller for six years.
[00:37:40.314 --> 00:37:41.855]  I was in the military for 11 years.
[00:37:41.915 --> 00:37:44.636]  I was in SAC for five of those years.
[00:37:46.337 --> 00:37:51.523]  I just know that the whole 9-11 thing could not have happened the way they tried to say it happened.
[00:37:52.203 --> 00:38:00.832]  And the problem with it is, and the one thing the 9-11 Commission has not addressed, and they continue to try to hide, is the fact that the air traffic control situation has never been addressed.
[00:38:01.433 --> 00:38:05.157]  And neither has the fact that the military, again, didn't do what they were supposed to do.
[00:38:05.497 --> 00:38:06.919]  They haven't addressed those issues at all.
[00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:11.194]  They just kind of glossed over them and took it as the assumption as being fact.
[00:38:11.334 --> 00:38:17.018]  And with the understanding that if the assumption is incorrect, then everything that comes from that is also a lie.
[00:38:17.759 --> 00:38:21.382]  Now, Richard, you're a successful businessman here in Austin.
[00:38:21.642 --> 00:38:26.526]  You know, fellow, going around, doing well in business, you know, wearing the suit, the whole nine yards.
[00:38:27.066 --> 00:38:29.308]  Why have you decided to go public and speak out?
[00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:36.415]  Well, specifically for the reason that there are several people who I know have information about this who are afraid to speak out about it.
[00:38:37.475 --> 00:38:43.501]  Having been in the military myself, I know that in most cases you're afraid of losing your pension, retirement, whatever it might be.
[00:38:43.581 --> 00:38:49.646]  Several of the air traffic controllers on the civilian side are probably doing the same thing, probably shaking their boots, not being allowed to say anything.
[00:38:49.666 --> 00:38:51.728]  They can't touch me, so I'm not really worried about that.
[00:38:54.061 --> 00:38:59.262]  Now, describe your job with the military, assigned with the FAA.
[00:38:59.322 --> 00:39:02.083]  Describe how things really work, because I talked to you about this.
[00:39:02.543 --> 00:39:15.548]  I mean, flying with my father, if there was a storm or something when I was growing up, he, in his Cessna, would fly around it, and there's a lot of controlled airspace in Texas, and he would have to radio them and explain, giving him an exact
[00:39:15.948 --> 00:39:21.749]  Well, let's look at the first aircraft that was flying over northwestern Pennsylvania, supposedly going to be heading toward
[00:39:45.174 --> 00:39:49.618]  Washington D.C., which you have to ask yourself how they knew it was going toward Washington D.C.
[00:39:49.658 --> 00:39:55.223]  If they didn't know about that on September the 12th, I mean on September the 10th, how did they know about that on September the 12th?
[00:39:55.523 --> 00:39:58.406]  That's where they're going to be flying unless they had a flight plan for these guys.
[00:39:59.046 --> 00:40:01.828]  Plus, that's an over 800 mile trip.
[00:40:02.129 --> 00:40:04.691]  I'm sure it was going to go through several people's airspace at that time.
[00:40:05.171 --> 00:40:08.354]  How were they going to make that flight without the help of air traffic control?
[00:40:08.374 --> 00:40:10.256]  You don't do that visually from 30,000 feet.
[00:40:10.856 --> 00:40:12.778]  There are no landmarks to see at that point.
[00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.271]  So we're asking ourselves several questions that were never presented.
[00:40:16.491 --> 00:40:19.411]  We were presented with facts without having asked the question.
[00:40:20.571 --> 00:40:29.713]  LaGuardia, Kennedy Air Force, Kennedy there and Newark International is the most densely populated air traffic in the country.
[00:40:30.233 --> 00:40:33.394]  And that's the busiest time at that time during the day.
[00:40:34.194 --> 00:40:38.515]  If you notice, if you go back and look at the 9-11 pictures, there are no other aircraft in the sky at that time.
[00:40:39.386 --> 00:40:42.228]  They've lied about the conversation they've had with the aircraft.
[00:40:42.529 --> 00:40:44.050]  You haven't heard any of those tapes.
[00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.031]  They said they destroyed them initially.
[00:40:46.752 --> 00:40:52.356]  I'm sorry, the initial lie was there was a lot of air traffic control clutter, which never happens.
[00:40:52.877 --> 00:40:53.958]  That was the initial lie.
[00:40:53.998 --> 00:41:00.263]  Then, two months ago, they said, we accidentally destroyed five tower tapes, and then now they're releasing select clips.
[00:41:00.463 --> 00:41:00.663]  Right.
[00:41:00.683 --> 00:41:06.728]  Well, first of all, there would have been several different facilities that would have contacted these aircraft.
[00:41:07.248 --> 00:41:08.228]  That's the first problem they have.
[00:41:08.248 --> 00:41:09.609]  They said five, is that accurate?
[00:41:10.129 --> 00:41:10.769]  Absolutely not.
[00:41:11.129 --> 00:41:13.150]  I mean, they didn't talk to the tower.
[00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:15.251]  The tower wouldn't have had control of them in the first place.
[00:41:15.271 --> 00:41:16.751]  There would have been tracons, there would have been spinners.
[00:41:17.111 --> 00:41:18.251]  They weren't in tower control.
[00:41:18.271 --> 00:41:21.372]  Tower is normally only going to deal with somebody that's going to be landing at the airline.
[00:41:21.392 --> 00:41:24.253]  In which case, if they were, maybe the tower was in control.
[00:41:24.333 --> 00:41:29.615]  Okay, then who are the five controllers or five control bases they're talking to?
[00:41:30.475 --> 00:41:33.497]  You've got the center of the country there.
[00:41:33.537 --> 00:41:37.419]  You've got the eastern part of the country, the eastern seaboard.
[00:41:37.739 --> 00:41:41.661]  You've got the people who control everything that's going on right over in the Pennsylvania, Ohio area.
[00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:43.922]  You've got the stuff that's going on in the Washington, D.C.
[00:41:43.982 --> 00:41:44.183]  area.
[00:41:44.203 --> 00:41:46.304]  So you have three different centers that would have been controlled.
[00:41:46.884 --> 00:41:50.086]  But at no point in time would you have gotten rid of those tapes.
[00:41:50.366 --> 00:41:51.987]  Those tapes are kept for five years minimum.
[00:41:52.367 --> 00:41:54.248]  In the case of an incident, ten years.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.201]  So they would have had to keep the tapes on.
[00:41:56.221 --> 00:42:06.266]  Now, the Associated Press had the NTSB saying, oh, we always destroy these, and we just got rid of these five tapes.
[00:42:06.386 --> 00:42:06.686]  No, no.
[00:42:07.006 --> 00:42:07.626]  Absolutely not.
[00:42:07.806 --> 00:42:12.729]  There's no way they would have gotten rid of tapes, especially if there was incidents on those tapes.
[00:42:12.749 --> 00:42:15.130]  But here's the real problem they have, even if they got rid of the tapes.
[00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:16.030]  Let's get past that.
[00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:16.831]  Let's give them that.
[00:42:17.371 --> 00:42:21.353]  Let's go back and look at the fact that everybody out there is on the same frequency in a given area.
[00:42:22.071 --> 00:42:28.458]  At some point in time, aircraft controllers would have been talking to other aircraft to make sure that I have no control over the aircraft that's out of my control at this point.
[00:42:28.818 --> 00:42:31.741]  Let me make sure I give you a vector away from where they're flying.
[00:42:32.221 --> 00:42:35.685]  You still have the ability to go back to those black boxes and listen to those conversations.
[00:42:36.269 --> 00:42:38.230]  And we haven't heard any of those conversations yet.
[00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:43.834]  They say all four were destroyed, but two passports magically fall from the sky on burn.
[00:42:44.074 --> 00:42:45.895]  Oh, well, we go back to that again.
[00:42:45.975 --> 00:42:48.877]  We're giving facts before we're asking questions.
[00:42:49.317 --> 00:42:51.699]  We said we knew these guys left from Boston.
[00:42:51.719 --> 00:42:52.779]  They left the IDs.
[00:42:53.059 --> 00:42:56.662]  Well, if they were going to kill themselves, why would they use fake IDs?
[00:42:57.922 --> 00:42:58.623]  That's ridiculous.
[00:42:59.164 --> 00:43:04.129]  But the reality is you have to look at those planes being flown, BFR, they were flying visually.
[00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:10.896]  They were going to fly from Washington, they were flying from Pennsylvania to Washington without any landmarks, no help, with no aircraft patrol help.
[00:43:11.236 --> 00:43:12.738]  The same thing with the aircraft in Albany.
[00:43:13.206 --> 00:43:16.529]  But then we look at what the standard procedures would have told us to do.
[00:43:16.569 --> 00:43:27.480]  Well, let's stop right there, Mr. Franklin, because talking to pilots, commercial pilots, you can't fly from one point to another off the landmarks at 30,000 feet.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.424]  You have to have those radio beacons, correct?
[00:43:31.564 --> 00:43:32.846]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:43:32.866 --> 00:43:33.967]  Well, explain that to people.
[00:43:34.207 --> 00:43:38.551]  They give you a vector, and then you tune into the beacon that you're flying to.
[00:43:38.751 --> 00:43:43.795]  Yeah, how do you fly perfectly two planes and another plane into a pentagon and two towers?
[00:43:43.995 --> 00:43:44.415]  Absolutely.
[00:43:44.776 --> 00:43:45.136]  Absolutely.
[00:43:45.156 --> 00:43:46.997]  That's another question that was not addressed.
[00:43:47.678 --> 00:43:55.084]  How were they able to fly through this airspace, no near hits, busiest time of day, nobody's telling them which way to go.
[00:43:55.344 --> 00:44:03.631]  But the other problem I'm having is the fact that they flew these intercept aircraft from Massachusetts and Virginia, when the closest bases were McGuire,
[00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.531]  And Andrews, right there in that area.
[00:44:05.551 --> 00:44:07.053]  And those guys are sitting on standby.
[00:44:07.133 --> 00:44:09.415]  Andrews is specifically set up to protect Washington, D.C.
[00:44:10.235 --> 00:44:10.976]  That's its mission.
[00:44:11.657 --> 00:44:15.480]  But, were you aware that one week before, they took Andrews off alert?
[00:44:16.118 --> 00:44:28.906]  And that three months before Rumsfeld took the control from the generals, who since 1958, when NORAD was shut up, had the command shoot down orders, three months before Rumsfeld took that power from them, we have the Pentagon Document.
[00:44:29.346 --> 00:44:31.067]  I was never, I was not aware of that.
[00:44:31.508 --> 00:44:32.888]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:44:33.189 --> 00:44:36.811]  We never asked a question, we were never told to go to a Vice President.
[00:44:36.871 --> 00:44:40.633]  I mean, again, the time increments, we don't have that kind of time.
[00:44:40.673 --> 00:44:43.555]  If you've ever seen a few good men, we don't ask questions, we just react.
[00:44:44.505 --> 00:44:49.421]  And you got some hot dogs out there that would have said, you know what, we're going hot, and they're taking somebody out of the sky.
[00:44:49.601 --> 00:44:50.183]  That's what they do.
[00:44:51.095 --> 00:44:56.759]  And if you remember the Corey Pavin incident and some other incidents that happened out here, it doesn't take them long to get on top of you.
[00:44:56.779 --> 00:45:00.082]  Well, there was the golfer, Payne Stewart.
[00:45:00.342 --> 00:45:02.043]  Stewart, I'm sorry, Payne Stewart.
[00:45:02.143 --> 00:45:05.986]  Yeah, within, what, 10 minutes planes were launched.
[00:45:06.226 --> 00:45:07.947]  Within 18 minutes, they were surrounded.
[00:45:08.188 --> 00:45:08.668]  That's correct.
[00:45:08.808 --> 00:45:10.569]  It doesn't take very long for them to get on top of you.
[00:45:10.589 --> 00:45:11.250]  And they go hot.
[00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:15.813]  When they get up in the air and they're going to escort somebody, they rock their wings a couple of times until you get on the ground.
[00:45:15.833 --> 00:45:17.254]  And if you don't get there, they put you there.
[00:45:18.235 --> 00:45:19.496]  So there are some questions about that.
[00:45:19.912 --> 00:45:26.760]  But then you have to look at the fact that they keep going back to the fact that there were only four or five guys on these airplanes taking over these multi-engine jets.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.103]  Again, did they know how to fly these jets?
[00:45:30.163 --> 00:45:31.485]  Where did they learn how to fly them?
[00:45:31.505 --> 00:45:35.369]  Because flight schools in Florida don't teach you how to fly those jets there.
[00:45:35.669 --> 00:45:36.991]  They don't have flight schools that teach that.
[00:45:37.011 --> 00:45:38.813]  That has to be taught at the airline.
[00:45:39.898 --> 00:45:44.921]  Well, they were such bad pilots that they would get in a Cessna in Florida and then jump out of it on the runway.
[00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:45.261]  Yeah.
[00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:53.325]  And, uh, I mean, I've heard that a Cessna is literally a hundred times easier to fly than one of these huge passenger jets.
[00:45:53.345 --> 00:46:01.569]  And again, the best pilots, the best pilots could not take off, fly 800 miles, and come back perfectly in T-bone buildings.
[00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:09.613]  Well, you're being made to understand that these guys were either extremely intelligent, which means that they could take over the airplane, fly this multi-engine jet,
[00:46:10.379 --> 00:46:27.783]  Without any help from anyone, knew what all the instruments were, so forth and so on, yet they were dumb enough to take the frequency on where the controller heard a conversation where the pilot was telling everybody to sit down or there'd be trouble.
[00:46:28.543 --> 00:46:31.523]  They knew everything about the airplane, but didn't know which button to hit for that.
[00:46:32.404 --> 00:46:34.564]  You see, so there's some questions there that should have been answered.
[00:46:35.231 --> 00:46:36.451]  No one's asked the pilot about that.
[00:46:36.511 --> 00:46:38.492]  No one's asked any controllers about that.
[00:46:38.792 --> 00:46:42.253]  No one's asked any questions about the fact that these guys could not have flown those airplanes.
[00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:42.913]  Period.
[00:46:44.133 --> 00:46:53.496]  And now they're saying, well, they were able to lock themselves into the cockpit and the whole of the cabin couldn't get into the cockpit, yet they were able to take over without any problems at all.
[00:46:55.256 --> 00:46:58.117]  A lot of questions that haven't been asked.
[00:46:58.137 --> 00:46:59.177]  They're not going to ask.
[00:46:59.257 --> 00:47:01.498]  It's like the elephant's in the room and nobody wants to recognize it.
[00:47:02.583 --> 00:47:12.834]  Well, again, when we had that conversation a few months ago, you're walking up to somebody at the grocery store counter, and you're done checking out, and you're going to talk to them for three minutes.
[00:47:13.074 --> 00:47:16.638]  What do you say to them, Richard Franklin, as a former air traffic controller?
[00:47:19.461 --> 00:47:25.227]  My God, I normally have a conversation for an hour, but by the time I'm finished with them, they have a lot of furrowed brows.
[00:47:26.196 --> 00:47:35.239]  Just ask them if you know that on September 10th you didn't know anything about these guys, then how is it on September 12th we knew where they were going to fly and the whole nine yards after that?
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:36.520]  You have to ask yourself.
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:52.886]  And how were they able to fly without any help from an air traffic controller and a multi-engine jet, visually, from 30,000 feet from Albany, New York, turn that airplane around and fly all the way through the most densely populated airspace in the country at the most densely populated time of day?
[00:47:53.693 --> 00:47:55.366]  And not hit anything else in the area.
[00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:56.536]  It makes no sense.
[00:47:57.097 --> 00:48:11.483]  Okay, the FAA admits that that day in that area, occupancy was at over 85%, but magically there was a computer malfunction at United and American, where exactly 20.3% were on board all four aircrafts.
[00:48:11.744 --> 00:48:17.546]  Not just averaged together 20.3%, but exactly 20.3% all four aircraft.
[00:48:17.566 --> 00:48:18.386]  How does that happen?
[00:48:18.727 --> 00:48:19.427]  Oh, absolutely not.
[00:48:19.507 --> 00:48:24.009]  And the other question you have to ask yourself, if you remember the question we had about the transponder,
[00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.749]  We're good to go.
[00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:40.823]  And aircraft that size still paints a large picture on the radar.
[00:48:41.223 --> 00:48:43.664]  So you've got the dot there with the little numbers beside it.
[00:48:43.944 --> 00:48:45.465]  All that disappears is the little numbers.
[00:48:45.545 --> 00:48:46.125]  That's correct.
[00:48:46.285 --> 00:48:48.566]  You don't know what he's flying at, what speed, so and so on.
[00:48:48.606 --> 00:48:58.250]  In which case, the controller would have had to talk to a lot of airplanes at that point because if you look at the flight path out there, he's going to cross a lot of flight paths and you don't know where he's flying at that point.
[00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:01.411]  You're going to get everybody out of the corridor you think he's going to be flying in.
[00:49:01.551 --> 00:49:03.492]  We now have a cliff that was released.
[00:49:04.005 --> 00:49:10.330]  By one of the controllers that they claim have been destroyed, BBC played it going, saying, is this a drill?
[00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:11.611]  Is this the exercise?
[00:49:12.111 --> 00:49:19.998]  We now know that the CIA, that morning at 8.30, just so happened to be running a drill of flying jets into New York and D.C.
[00:49:20.018 --> 00:49:32.167]  landmarks, and I've been told by my sources before this even came out, that that was a smoke screen for NORAD and the FAA to stand down, that it was just a drill, and then later they said, oh, it's not a drill, that way it was too late.
[00:49:32.187 --> 00:49:33.048]  Do you have comments on that?
[00:49:33.268 --> 00:49:38.112]  So was that the premise where they didn't contact the guy sitting right there at McGuire Air Force Base sitting on the ground?
[00:49:38.272 --> 00:49:39.754]  Is that what the premise they used at that time?
[00:49:39.774 --> 00:49:40.334]  Is that what they're saying?
[00:49:40.575 --> 00:49:44.098]  That's what I was told by my sources then it came out in the news.
[00:49:45.459 --> 00:49:46.600]  That's unbelievable.
[00:49:47.461 --> 00:49:54.447]  Well, I'm sure the CIA was running a drill of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center and Pentagon at 8.30 that morning just by total accident.
[00:49:54.667 --> 00:49:55.868]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:49:56.268 --> 00:49:59.271]  But then the official story is they'd never heard of such a plan.
[00:50:01.562 --> 00:50:04.603]  But then magically they're running a drill of the exact same thing that morning.
[00:50:05.464 --> 00:50:07.124]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:50:07.185 --> 00:50:12.707]  My biggest question here now, as you tell me, is the Vice President has to be informed before you shoot down a civilian aircraft.
[00:50:12.987 --> 00:50:13.587]  He was.
[00:50:14.148 --> 00:50:15.228]  He was in Site R.
[00:50:18.041 --> 00:50:19.482]  Outside D.C.
[00:50:19.802 --> 00:50:24.404]  running things, but under national security, they will not release what he said.
[00:50:24.484 --> 00:50:30.127]  And supposedly, he was on loudspeakers in the bunkers nationwide, telling people what to do.
[00:50:30.147 --> 00:50:36.690]  And what we have is a... The whole administration is cloaked in secrecy.
[00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:39.812]  We can't get any answers out here on anything that's going on right now.
[00:50:40.452 --> 00:50:46.595]  And again, if one of these things is true, then the entire premise that they've given us on 9-11 is all of it's a lie.
[00:50:47.091 --> 00:50:49.855]  And everything they've done since 9-11 has also been a lie.
[00:50:50.115 --> 00:50:50.636]  Amazing!
[00:50:50.676 --> 00:50:52.979]  Richard Franklin, stay there my friend, we'll be back.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.483]  PrisonPlanet.tv, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:00.572 --> 00:51:07.394]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:07.714 --> 00:51:09.095]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:09.295 --> 00:51:11.495]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:13.736]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:13.996 --> 00:51:18.958]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:19.278 --> 00:51:23.319]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:23.579 --> 00:51:25.341]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:25.421 --> 00:51:36.073]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plumbable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.233 --> 00:51:38.096]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:38.456 --> 00:51:42.180]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the Infowars.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.822]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:43.842 --> 00:51:44.242]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:44.262 --> 00:51:46.664]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:51:46.684 --> 00:51:47.746]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:51:59.753 --> 00:52:02.775]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:03.095 --> 00:52:08.017]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:08.278 --> 00:52:12.640]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:21.825]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:22.045 --> 00:52:25.667]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:25.947 --> 00:52:30.972]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:31.272 --> 00:52:38.019]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:38.499 --> 00:52:39.040]  What about you?
[00:52:39.796 --> 00:52:45.139]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.261]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:53:00.814 --> 00:53:01.154]  I think so.
[00:53:16.039 --> 00:53:16.699]  We're good to go.

[00:54:03.815 --> 00:54:04.495]  All right, folks.
[00:54:08.336 --> 00:54:32.644]  In thousands of cases where small aircraft, large aircraft, private, commercial get off course for even a few minutes, they are called by the towers, by the controllers, and if they don't respond instantly, and the military's over all this, again, the towers are just over when you come in for a landing,
[00:54:33.507 --> 00:54:37.568]  They launch fighter aircraft, and they come, and they shoot you down.
[00:54:38.529 --> 00:54:39.489]  They tell you where to land.
[00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:43.130]  Or they follow your plane until it crashes in a safe area.
[00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:45.251]  If it looks like it's going into a populated area, they shoot you down.
[00:54:45.811 --> 00:54:56.614]  But magically, in this case, not with one, not with two, not with three, but with four aircraft over, what, the fourth aircraft right around two hours later,
[00:54:58.004 --> 00:55:04.209]  We have that from the people, we know the name of the pilot, shooting down Flight 93 finally, and basically refusing orders.
[00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:05.991]  Because it was going for the Capitol.
[00:55:07.112 --> 00:55:13.017]  A general just ordered it shot down, going back to his old authority of three months prior, before Rumsfeld had taken that authority away.
[00:55:13.797 --> 00:55:20.703]  Now we're going to start the second hour with Richard Franklin, and I promise we'll go to Mike, Danny, Bob, Dan, and others that have been patiently holding.
[00:55:20.723 --> 00:55:21.504]  I appreciate you holding.
[00:55:22.188 --> 00:55:38.496]  I know you'll want to talk about a bunch of different issues, and I'm sure Mr. Franklin can talk about that with us as well, but in about 30 minutes, we've got some other guests about the situation with the Democratic National Convention, a total promotion of the police state to condition you.
[00:55:39.136 --> 00:55:42.058]  But Mr. Franklin, there's so many other facets to this.
[00:55:42.802 --> 00:55:44.964]  I mean, we know there are official stories of fraud.
[00:55:45.004 --> 00:55:52.250]  We know we've proven massive lies and cover-ups and changed stories over and over again.
[00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:55.593]  Any other key points you want to make concerning this?
[00:55:55.974 --> 00:55:56.814]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:55:57.195 --> 00:56:01.899]  The problem we're having right now is that pilots aren't jumping up and down about the fact that these guys were allowed to.
[00:56:02.763 --> 00:56:17.131]  Perpetrate the lie that they were able to fly or learn how to fly these multi-engine jets, having only been in the country for a year and a half, and the amount of hours, the flight hours necessary just to qualify to get into a cockpit or a simulator to learn how to fly a multi-engine jet.
[00:56:17.571 --> 00:56:18.512]  Pilots should be up in arms.
[00:56:18.672 --> 00:56:21.033]  I mean, we've just told them their job isn't worth anything.
[00:56:21.573 --> 00:56:26.396]  Along with that, how many different things would have had to go wrong at the time for this to have happened the way it did?
[00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:28.513]  There's another question that has to be looked at.
[00:56:28.573 --> 00:56:33.599]  How many things would have happened the right way just for those things to happen the way they did?
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.561]  That's another question.
[00:56:34.701 --> 00:56:41.409]  Well, bottom line, Richard, the government's official story is the biggest, most ridiculous conspiracy theory I've ever heard.
[00:56:43.021 --> 00:56:46.682]  Well, I look at a lot of different things that you have to question yourself on.
[00:56:47.022 --> 00:56:51.743]  Up to and including Henry Kissinger backing out, saying, well, you know, I had a conflict of interest.
[00:56:52.184 --> 00:56:53.504]  Well, did you know the terrorist?
[00:56:53.864 --> 00:56:58.005]  I mean, exactly how does that work when you're involved in this situation or you're afraid to look into it?
[00:56:58.525 --> 00:56:59.866]  Are you afraid that you're going to be exposed?
[00:56:59.886 --> 00:57:01.906]  That you know something about this that we don't want to know?
[00:57:02.446 --> 00:57:08.648]  Again, everybody seems to be covering their own behinds on this without actually understanding... Well, we also have the Commission.
[00:57:08.708 --> 00:57:11.629]  They've all got conflicts of interest and they were appointed by Bush.
[00:57:11.849 --> 00:57:12.309]  Absolutely.
[00:57:12.868 --> 00:57:13.228]  Absolutely.
[00:57:13.628 --> 00:57:15.709]  And I looked at the whole cockpit.
[00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:17.770]  They can't have flown the way they did.
[00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:20.251]  They can't have looked at where they were going the way they were doing it.
[00:57:20.572 --> 00:57:22.853]  There are just too many things that are wrong with this whole premise.
[00:57:22.873 --> 00:57:25.154]  I mean, there's too many things for me even to go into right now.
[00:57:25.194 --> 00:57:30.936]  I had to sit down with somebody for three or four hours to talk about how many different things on that day went wrong.
[00:57:30.956 --> 00:57:33.438]  Let me give you a standard procedure for a guy who's flying.
[00:57:33.758 --> 00:57:38.460]  If I talk to you and then you stop talking to me and I'm talking to you again and you don't respond,
[00:57:39.568 --> 00:57:45.835]  Within two minutes of you not responding to me, I instantly, I don't ask questions, I have you escorted at that point.
[00:57:45.955 --> 00:57:52.302]  Two minutes of non-communications, after I've talked to you, I will get Jet to escort you to the ground.
[00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:54.664]  And this is before 9-11?
[00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:55.445]  Absolutely.
[00:57:56.126 --> 00:57:56.586]  Absolutely.
[00:57:56.626 --> 00:58:00.270]  You don't have to shoot him down, but you will be escorted.
[00:58:00.888 --> 00:58:04.011]  So if they have to get permission to be shot down, I'd even let them have that.
[00:58:04.311 --> 00:58:06.693]  But those aircraft were all off course for over 15 minutes.
[00:58:06.793 --> 00:58:10.676]  After the first plane hit the building, the second aircraft was still off course for over 15 minutes.
[00:58:11.016 --> 00:58:13.938]  McGuire can get in the air in less than five minutes.
[00:58:14.459 --> 00:58:17.161]  They could have been intercepted well before they ever got to that second tower.
[00:58:17.581 --> 00:58:18.722]  So that wasn't even a problem.
[00:58:18.862 --> 00:58:22.185]  They could have been escorted, even without being shot down.
[00:58:23.206 --> 00:58:24.967]  But I'm sure that they knew they were going to be shot down.
[00:58:24.987 --> 00:58:27.309]  They could have turned that aircraft around, if that be the case.
[00:58:29.429 --> 00:58:33.373]  Unless nerve gas has been released and remote control is in power.
[00:58:34.154 --> 00:58:35.095]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:58:35.215 --> 00:58:42.062]  That's my whole thought process is they will control those aircraft some other way than somebody in the aircraft actually controlling them.
[00:58:42.082 --> 00:58:45.205]  Because computers can fly a jet just like a cruise missile.
[00:58:46.367 --> 00:58:47.248]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:47.748 --> 00:58:48.289]  Stay with us.
[00:58:57.674 --> 00:58:58.334]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.974 --> 00:59:00.015]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.735 --> 00:59:01.855]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.516 --> 00:59:03.336]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.076 --> 00:59:04.996]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.637 --> 00:59:09.458]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.818 --> 00:59:13.939]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:19.161]  This broadcast is not left or right.
[00:59:19.241 --> 00:59:21.142]  It's about right and wrong.
[00:59:21.802 --> 00:59:23.262]  We're anti-corrupt law.
[00:59:23.282 --> 00:59:24.723]  We're anti-New World Order.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.701]  We're against gun control, we're against tyranny.
[00:59:29.861 --> 00:59:41.785]  Carol Rose, Executive Director of the ACLU in Massachusetts, joins us from the Democratic National Convention, the big police state training op that we'll be covering.
[00:59:41.845 --> 00:59:46.447]  Protesters in cages, troops, machine guns, helicopters in the sky.
[00:59:47.087 --> 00:59:49.248]  Has nothing to do with keeping the population safe.
[00:59:50.505 --> 01:00:01.189]  Then in the next hour, Tom Wallace and Janine Cresenzo joining us, who were also there protesting in the middle of all of this.
[01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:03.130]  It's a big deal, so stay with us.
[01:00:04.451 --> 01:00:11.514]  I know we haven't taken calls yet, because I was telling the story of how I got knocked off the road by a tornado last night and barely survived.
[01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:12.394]  Thank God I did.
[01:00:15.335 --> 01:00:19.877]  Also, we've got Richard Franklin, who was in the Army with SAC.
[01:00:20.839 --> 01:00:23.401]  In the military for 11 years, 12 years with SAC.
[01:00:23.441 --> 01:00:24.002]  I believe he said for 6.
[01:00:24.382 --> 01:00:26.784]  I've got his bio and his resume right here.
[01:00:26.804 --> 01:00:29.306]  He now is a successful businessman here in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:29.946 --> 01:00:35.791]  Going over how their official story of the stand-down of NORAD is impossible.
[01:00:37.772 --> 01:00:40.374]  But callers are holding on a whole plethora of issues.
[01:00:42.082 --> 01:00:49.309]  We'll go back over the impossibilities of 9-11, just in this one facet, a little bit later in this 30 minutes.
[01:00:49.329 --> 01:00:51.270]  But right now, Richard, you want to take some calls?
[01:00:51.491 --> 01:00:51.731]  Sure.
[01:00:52.271 --> 01:00:53.452]  They'll probably be all over the map.
[01:00:53.893 --> 01:00:57.256]  Mike in Illinois, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:00:57.296 --> 01:00:57.656]  Go ahead.
[01:00:58.036 --> 01:00:58.477]  Hey, Richard.
[01:00:58.497 --> 01:00:59.278]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:59.298 --> 01:01:02.160]  Hey, Richard, thanks for coming on and having the guts to do what you're doing.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:06.664]  It's great, because if it's not people like you, there's no way we're going to fight this new oral order.
[01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:08.086]  I just want to ask you guys.
[01:01:09.042 --> 01:01:16.274]  Alex, something did cross my mind because I was talking to a guy, I was in the Air Force for six years myself, and he had told me about two months ago that...
[01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:25.519]  Jet airliners can be flown by computer, and actually he is the one that suggested to me that it's a possibility that those terrorists were not flying those planes.
[01:01:25.639 --> 01:01:28.200]  Well look, look, look, the terrorists couldn't do it.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:41.229]  Some of the best pilots in the country, maybe one out of ten times, could fly a plane hundreds of miles by dead reckoning at 30,000 feet, come down with no radio beacons, and perfectly T-bone a building.
[01:01:41.469 --> 01:01:45.872]  But it doesn't happen twice, it doesn't happen three times with the Pentagon, even harder to do,
[01:01:47.273 --> 01:01:49.254]  You know, this is a joke, people.
[01:01:49.834 --> 01:01:57.837]  And, again, they, a decade ago, flew a jumbo jet from California to Australia by remote control.
[01:01:57.937 --> 01:01:58.257]  Richard?
[01:01:58.517 --> 01:02:01.878]  Yeah, you have to look at the fact that microprocessors are easily controlled.
[01:02:01.898 --> 01:02:04.399]  That's why they have you turn off your cell phone inside the plane.
[01:02:04.419 --> 01:02:08.061]  It doesn't take much power to even control what's inside the cockpit now.
[01:02:08.661 --> 01:02:11.902]  Along with that, look at the flight plan, or not, let's say the flight path,
[01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:12.590]  I don't know.
[01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:32.100]  Has anybody said anything about the fact that their windows would have been exploding all over Washington, D.C.?
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:49.232]  Well, also, pilots have said, I've interviewed them, that they couldn't keep a plane that low and that perfect because at full speed they would have had to hit their flaps and turn the nose of the plane up just because of the wind shear or the pressure of the wind.
[01:02:49.372 --> 01:02:54.515]  Well, I'm waiting for them to release the pictures of the airplane off the Pentagon where it actually crashes into the Pentagon.
[01:02:54.555 --> 01:02:55.796]  They have cameras on the building.
[01:02:56.385 --> 01:02:58.026]  And they should have those pictures available.
[01:02:58.306 --> 01:03:03.208]  They're only releasing certain portions of information as they fabricate it.
[01:03:03.508 --> 01:03:07.009]  Such as the guys who were being checked at Dulles the other day, they're now releasing that.
[01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:09.350]  Here are these guys getting on airplanes, see them being double checked.
[01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:10.431]  Those kind of things.
[01:03:10.631 --> 01:03:15.733]  We're releasing that information now because people are asking questions and they're trying to go back and cover those bases.
[01:03:15.753 --> 01:03:20.414]  But you do have the pictures of the Pentagon where an airplane should have run into the building.
[01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:21.595]  Haven't seen those yet.
[01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:25.671]  Now, didn't you say it's possible that no plane did actually hit the Pentagon?
[01:03:25.891 --> 01:03:27.472]  Absolutely not.
[01:03:27.492 --> 01:03:30.153]  I don't believe an airplane actually ever hit the Pentagon.
[01:03:30.413 --> 01:03:37.415]  If you go back and look at the ground pictures and see where the wingspan should have torn into the ground or the building, that is non-existent.
[01:03:37.995 --> 01:03:40.636]  Well, when a plane crashes, I mean, there's a huge debris field.
[01:03:40.656 --> 01:03:41.356]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:41.816 --> 01:03:42.336]  Right, Cole?
[01:03:42.376 --> 01:03:43.277]  More calls coming up.
[01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:45.077]  Stay with us.
[01:03:52.293 --> 01:03:55.115]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:03:55.255 --> 01:03:56.076]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:03:56.216 --> 01:03:59.499]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:03:59.699 --> 01:04:05.363]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:04:05.504 --> 01:04:08.526]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:04:08.786 --> 01:04:13.069]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:15.170]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:22.335]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:04:22.535 --> 01:04:24.997]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:04:25.297 --> 01:04:27.979]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[01:04:28.119 --> 01:04:29.620]  Only this time, it changed my life.
[01:04:29.901 --> 01:04:31.662]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[01:04:31.762 --> 01:04:33.824]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[01:04:34.044 --> 01:04:36.486]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[01:04:36.526 --> 01:04:39.228]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:04:39.428 --> 01:04:39.948]  Side effects?
[01:04:40.128 --> 01:04:42.410]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:43.851]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:04:43.871 --> 01:04:44.071]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:04:44.091 --> 01:04:45.272]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:04:45.312 --> 01:04:46.053]  It worked for me.
[01:04:52.217 --> 01:04:55.480]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:59.743]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:02.765]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:05.367]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:05.547 --> 01:05:10.611]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing
[01:05:10.711 --> 01:05:11.913]  We're good to go!
[01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:31.635]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[01:05:56.042 --> 01:05:57.324]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:05:57.544 --> 01:06:03.270]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:06:03.551 --> 01:06:08.817]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:06:09.097 --> 01:06:13.222]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:06:13.482 --> 01:06:17.204]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:06:17.464 --> 01:06:22.086]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:28.448]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:06:28.488 --> 01:06:30.329]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:06:30.929 --> 01:06:33.210]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:35.090]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:04.067]  We're talking to Richard Franklin.
[01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:08.492]  And Richard worked for the U.S.
[01:07:08.552 --> 01:07:10.073]  military in SAC.
[01:07:11.534 --> 01:07:16.599]  And they've got these big bases all around the country that the military runs with the FAA.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:25.067]  They've shown it on television where they watch the big boards and track every aircraft coming in and out of the country, what's happening domestically.
[01:07:25.187 --> 01:07:27.189]  Every aircraft is a blip with a number.
[01:07:29.272 --> 01:07:33.233]  And within minutes of an aircraft getting off course or not responding, they launch fighter aircraft.
[01:07:33.273 --> 01:07:35.454]  In every case, until September 11th.
[01:07:36.835 --> 01:07:40.136]  We've been talking about how their official story is impossible.
[01:07:40.196 --> 01:07:42.076]  Their official story is a fraud.
[01:07:42.116 --> 01:07:44.077]  Has been proven to be a fraud.
[01:07:45.858 --> 01:07:49.419]  And so many pilots have said they couldn't without landmarks.
[01:07:50.539 --> 01:07:51.499]  Fly at a low level.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.120]  Fly into those buildings perfectly.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.361]  Much less from 30,000 feet if it wasn't even their original flight plan.
[01:07:56.741 --> 01:07:58.682]  Aircraft fly according to beacons.
[01:07:59.631 --> 01:08:02.232]  And I don't think a lot of people quite understand this.
[01:08:02.272 --> 01:08:14.596]  You know, back in the old days, remember, flying prop-driven aircraft, they were always getting off course and crashing and dying, even passenger planes, back in the 40s, 50s, 60s, before they really developed all of this, because it was very dangerous.
[01:08:14.616 --> 01:08:20.078]  You would get off course, much less bringing it down to just a few hundred feet, hitting these buildings.
[01:08:20.438 --> 01:08:22.719]  We're about to go to Danny, Bob, Dan, and
[01:08:24.597 --> 01:08:27.824]  Mark and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:08:28.486 --> 01:08:32.695]  But Mr. Franklin, I think this is the most important facet of this.
[01:08:32.735 --> 01:08:33.918]  When you were working for SAC,
[01:08:36.348 --> 01:08:39.070]  Just explain to people out there that don't understand this.
[01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:41.212]  It's not like driving your car with dead reckoning.
[01:08:42.072 --> 01:08:53.041]  I mean, how hard would it be for someone, three separate aircraft, to take off and to fly and do these incredible maneuvers without radio beacons and to fly them perfectly into buildings?
[01:08:53.601 --> 01:08:54.702]  Absolutely impossible.
[01:08:55.102 --> 01:08:57.864]  In fact, in most cases, you're flying from point to point.
[01:08:58.385 --> 01:09:01.507]  As the beacon, they give you different frequencies to fly to these different beacons.
[01:09:02.179 --> 01:09:08.523]  But, you don't get under air traffic control, where they actually control you, until you get near enough to land to something.
[01:09:09.004 --> 01:09:11.205]  You're going toward a runway or something along that line.
[01:09:11.666 --> 01:09:14.107]  Or lining up for an ILS approach or something along that line.
[01:09:14.187 --> 01:09:19.431]  Then you're actually under air traffic control saying, okay, you need to fly such and such, you're high or low, whatever.
[01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:21.913]  We don't do that until they get very, very close to the ground.
[01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:23.914]  What they did was virtually impossible.
[01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:26.196]  But there's something else that needs to be looked into here.
[01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:28.077]  I also have an aircraft dispatch license.
[01:09:29.009 --> 01:09:35.617]  The fuel that they said caused the airplane to melt, I don't remember the lie that came right after the situation on IA&E.
[01:09:35.637 --> 01:09:43.426]  They were talking about the fact that the buildings fell down because the metal started to melt, blah, blah, blah, and so forth.
[01:09:43.726 --> 01:09:48.071]  If anybody goes back and looks at the fact that jet fuel, and you can look it up online, you can Google it, search it, or whatever.
[01:09:48.519 --> 01:09:50.340]  And look at jet fuel and temperature it burns at.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.901]  It burns at 1112 degrees.
[01:09:52.541 --> 01:09:54.222]  It's a very cool burn for the most part.
[01:09:54.742 --> 01:09:59.944]  Compared to the temperature that it would have had, it would have been a blast furnace.
[01:10:00.445 --> 01:10:03.066]  To have caused something to melt the way they said melted.
[01:10:03.386 --> 01:10:06.348]  So the problem they have is the fact that those buildings could not have fallen the way they did.
[01:10:06.688 --> 01:10:10.009]  And we go back and look at the seismographic graph and so forth and so on.
[01:10:10.369 --> 01:10:11.630]  All those things are not true.
[01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:13.571]  None of that could have happened.
[01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:17.673]  And what element would have been added to the fuel to have caused it to burn that hot?
[01:10:18.012 --> 01:10:19.393]  There's some other questions we have to look at.
[01:10:20.033 --> 01:10:26.598]  So, there are a lot of questions after the fact, they try to go back and try to cover up later on with their own explanations, which again, were implausible.
[01:10:27.939 --> 01:10:30.341]  So no, the airplanes could not have flown the way they were, I'm sorry.
[01:10:30.941 --> 01:10:33.703]  Absolutely, and again, we've talked to pilots.
[01:10:33.823 --> 01:10:37.386]  We have this large passenger jet that no one saw.
[01:10:37.406 --> 01:10:40.288]  People say they saw a small commutator or a small jet.
[01:10:40.308 --> 01:10:42.229]  That's what eyewitnesses all said they saw.
[01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:44.211]  It flies around, swoops,
[01:10:44.831 --> 01:10:57.759]  Does a 360, comes back in, flies at 30 feet off the ground, folks, at full power, which you supposedly can't do because the wind builds up under the engines and pushes the aircraft back up.
[01:10:58.099 --> 01:11:00.801]  They have to come in with their nose up, with their flaps up, folks.
[01:11:01.922 --> 01:11:13.650]  That's how they're able to do this, but no, this thing comes straight in, perfectly hitched, leaves a 12-foot hole, no wreckage, and then later it collapses, and that's the images were shown.
[01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:15.051]  Another impossibility.
[01:11:15.711 --> 01:11:16.151]  Absolutely.
[01:11:16.872 --> 01:11:20.434]  And the vortex coming off those wings and so forth is a tornado.
[01:11:20.975 --> 01:11:23.136]  They could not have controlled that aircraft the way they said they controlled it.
[01:11:23.957 --> 01:11:25.758]  And I'm still believing it was a cruise missile myself.
[01:11:27.466 --> 01:11:29.267]  But again, it's all the sleight of hand.
[01:11:29.367 --> 01:11:30.568]  They tell us what to believe.
[01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:31.229]  We buy it.
[01:11:31.509 --> 01:11:31.729]  Right.
[01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:33.891]  And no one wants to recognize the elephant.
[01:11:34.271 --> 01:11:36.112]  Okay, let's talk to Danny in Ohio.
[01:11:36.152 --> 01:11:37.053]  Danny, thanks for holding.
[01:11:37.073 --> 01:11:37.493]  Go ahead.
[01:11:37.513 --> 01:11:38.934]  Hi, Alex.
[01:11:39.355 --> 01:11:39.635]  Hello.
[01:11:40.435 --> 01:11:45.679]  Well, I've called in before, as you know, and my mom, she was driving.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:50.503]  She was driving her parents to the airport, and that's where we're driving.
[01:11:51.203 --> 01:11:56.427]  When I was on the way back, when we were driving back, me and my mom, we saw this chem trail.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:58.301]  It was right in front of the sun.
[01:11:58.321 --> 01:12:00.262]  It looked like it was exactly on the sun.
[01:12:00.963 --> 01:12:11.309]  And then, after that, a couple days later, I was cleaning the bathroom and my mom called me outside and she saw a satellite that looked like it was sitting right there on the moon.
[01:12:11.489 --> 01:12:12.109]  Just sitting.
[01:12:12.289 --> 01:12:13.150]  It did not move.
[01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:15.231]  And then it started to disappear.
[01:12:15.251 --> 01:12:21.495]  Well, you might have been seeing a drone or something, but I know out in West Texas you can watch the satellites all day, but, uh,
[01:12:22.353 --> 01:12:28.775]  Well, it was probably a blimp or aircraft or something, but there is a lot of weird stuff going on with atmospheric manipulation.
[01:12:28.795 --> 01:12:32.836]  The BBC admitted that the Chinese government has been manipulating their weather.
[01:12:32.856 --> 01:12:36.257]  I mean, that's an old science, but how old are you, Dani?
[01:12:36.277 --> 01:12:36.977]  Ten.
[01:12:37.977 --> 01:12:40.658]  Well, it's good to have you listening to the broadcast.
[01:12:41.298 --> 01:12:42.259]  How are you listening to us?
[01:12:44.659 --> 01:12:46.840]  I'm listening to it on a shortwave radio.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.701]  Great, because we've got two affiliates in Ohio
[01:12:51.619 --> 01:12:55.442]  And you might be able to listen to us on your local AM stations, but good to hear from you, Danny.
[01:12:56.503 --> 01:12:57.884]  Let's talk to Bob in Texas.
[01:12:57.964 --> 01:12:58.765]  Bob, you're on the air.
[01:12:58.825 --> 01:12:59.225]  Go ahead.
[01:12:59.245 --> 01:13:00.486]  Hi, gentlemen.
[01:13:00.787 --> 01:13:01.427]  Good afternoon.
[01:13:01.867 --> 01:13:03.229]  I'm glad you made it, Alex.
[01:13:03.289 --> 01:13:05.811]  I saw that storm yesterday, and it was a monster.
[01:13:06.051 --> 01:13:09.474]  Probably I was looking at it just as you were getting swiped off the road.
[01:13:09.494 --> 01:13:11.575]  Well, I told that story an hour ago.
[01:13:11.976 --> 01:13:13.917]  For those that just joined us, why don't you recap?
[01:13:14.938 --> 01:13:17.840]  You're coming back from Fredericksburg with your father.
[01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:30.538]  Apparently you got caught in the vortex of a tornado and it whipped you off the road and smashed the car up pretty good and gave your father a concussion and the steering wheel busted off in your hand.
[01:13:30.938 --> 01:13:34.160]  I don't know if that's just cheap engineering or you were holding on so tight.
[01:13:34.941 --> 01:13:39.424]  Oh no, it was definitely I was bracing as we flew off the road backwards and hit two huge oak trees.
[01:13:40.277 --> 01:13:46.101]  And you just cracked into the steering column and totally smashed in the vehicle about four or five feet.
[01:13:46.261 --> 01:13:54.407]  I saw several tails trying to come down out of that same cloud that was coming in from Fredericksburg, so it's no surprise that you ran into some pretty stiff winds there.
[01:13:54.727 --> 01:13:56.208]  Are you listening to us in Fredericksburg?
[01:13:56.728 --> 01:13:59.390]  No, no, I'm actually in San Marcos listening to you.
[01:14:00.111 --> 01:14:07.616]  Yeah, no, I mean the police radios were saying a tornado hit Johnson City right as I was coming in to Johnson City.
[01:14:08.471 --> 01:14:12.913]  And so I was definitely in a tornadic, or is that the right word?
[01:14:13.674 --> 01:14:14.114]  Winds.
[01:14:14.514 --> 01:14:14.714]  Yeah.
[01:14:15.175 --> 01:14:16.195]  Tornadic vortex.
[01:14:16.975 --> 01:14:17.456]  Yeah, it was.
[01:14:18.196 --> 01:14:19.297]  Oh, I'm blessed to be alive.
[01:14:19.317 --> 01:14:28.021]  Yeah, we're real glad you're still with us because I don't think this whole thing would be going the way it's going right now without your force of will.
[01:14:28.902 --> 01:14:30.222]  Well, I'm just one person.
[01:14:30.282 --> 01:14:31.563]  Well, you're a powerful person.
[01:14:31.583 --> 01:14:37.226]  You have a powerful personality and it's steering a lot of people and giving them the courage to keep up the fight.
[01:14:37.967 --> 01:14:55.460]  And, uh, I wanted to ask Richard one thing, uh, going back about seven, eight years ago, do you recall, uh, there was a big stink over National Guard, uh, F-16s, boasting these, uh, uh, passenger liners, and they said they were just, uh, goofing off and, uh, being kind of radical.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.641]  Well, here's my take on it.
[01:14:57.122 --> 01:15:03.807]  I think way back then, seven or eight years ago, they were on to the idea of these airliners being used as, as missiles.
[01:15:04.087 --> 01:15:04.947]  That had been in the news!
[01:15:05.007 --> 01:15:05.528]  We knew that!
[01:15:06.138 --> 01:15:06.298]  Mm-hmm.
[01:15:06.378 --> 01:15:10.664]  And what they were doing by flying close, of course, was they were looking in the window to see if there were passengers.
[01:15:10.684 --> 01:15:14.589]  And if they looked in the windows and they didn't see passengers, they were going to knock those things out of the air.
[01:15:14.609 --> 01:15:15.630]  And they were out of the D.C.
[01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:15.991]  Guard.
[01:15:16.431 --> 01:15:17.433]  National Guard Armory.
[01:15:18.034 --> 01:15:18.614]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:18.654 --> 01:15:21.598]  You'll find that most of the airport's pilots are hot dogs.
[01:15:21.658 --> 01:15:23.400]  I mean, these guys, they're hot to go.
[01:15:23.661 --> 01:15:24.442]  They really don't care.
[01:15:25.014 --> 01:15:28.238]  But for them to tell me that they were going to shoot those airplanes down, that's a crock.
[01:15:28.498 --> 01:15:28.678]  Right.
[01:15:28.718 --> 01:15:46.117]  Well, then they wouldn't have been shadowing those planes years before 9-11 if it wasn't because they didn't think that there was something... Well, look, I have articles from 95, you know, CNN, Associated Press, saying, you know, plans to fly hijacked jets into World Trade Center, Pentagon, CIA headquarters, Capitol.
[01:15:47.289 --> 01:15:49.691]  And then Bush said, we had never heard of such a plan.
[01:15:50.111 --> 01:15:52.352]  No one had ever even dreamed of this.
[01:15:52.913 --> 01:16:00.938]  Meanwhile, they're running a drill two years before, six months before, and the morning of the exact same thing happening that happened.
[01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:01.939]  Thanks for the call, Bob.
[01:16:01.999 --> 01:16:05.281]  And I just want to thank God that I am still alive from yesterday.
[01:16:06.942 --> 01:16:08.223]  Any comments to what he was saying?
[01:16:08.443 --> 01:16:09.443]  Can I just add one thing here?
[01:16:09.603 --> 01:16:09.844]  Sure.
[01:16:10.104 --> 01:16:13.526]  I spoke to Ralph Nader when he was here in Austin a couple of months ago.
[01:16:14.273 --> 01:16:17.274]  And I actually threw the same thing I'm throwing at you right now.
[01:16:17.414 --> 01:16:20.434]  I said, what do you think about this, this, this, and this?
[01:16:20.594 --> 01:16:26.976]  And Ralph, and I kind of appreciate a lot of things he's tried to do in his life, but the man literally looked at me with blank eyes and said, I can't touch that.
[01:16:27.976 --> 01:16:29.196]  And that was kind of frightening to me.
[01:16:29.216 --> 01:16:31.497]  Yeah, because he said, I can't touch that.
[01:16:31.637 --> 01:16:32.217]  I can't touch that.
[01:16:33.397 --> 01:16:35.177]  Now, what does that mean, you can't touch that?
[01:16:35.217 --> 01:16:37.918]  You've gone after GM, you've gone after all these other companies.
[01:16:38.238 --> 01:16:42.579]  You can't go after the military for what they've done, or the government for the things they're perpetrating at this point?
[01:16:43.092 --> 01:16:43.832]  That makes total sense to me.
[01:16:43.852 --> 01:16:45.353]  Let me ask you a question, Richard.
[01:16:45.373 --> 01:16:53.457]  You just go off the facts, the science, your expertise being a SAC air traffic controller monitor, but...
[01:16:54.244 --> 01:17:03.289]  I mean, we have official government plans like Northwood's that say we're going to hijack jets, crash them, blame it on foreign enemies to mobilize the people behind war.
[01:17:03.329 --> 01:17:07.131]  I mean, we have an official government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks.
[01:17:07.171 --> 01:17:08.232]  How important is that to you?
[01:17:08.372 --> 01:17:09.452]  Well, we've done it before.
[01:17:09.512 --> 01:17:12.614]  I mean, historically speaking, we did Pearl Harbor.
[01:17:12.674 --> 01:17:16.196]  We've done the Spanish-American War.
[01:17:16.296 --> 01:17:18.697]  I mean, we've done it before to our own people.
[01:17:18.737 --> 01:17:22.659]  It's not that we won't kill our own people to get ourselves involved in something that's going to get the elite paid.
[01:17:24.013 --> 01:17:24.974]  That's what we're having to look at.
[01:17:24.994 --> 01:17:26.595]  The elite don't care about us at all.
[01:17:26.935 --> 01:17:29.878]  At the bottom, the people in the middle and the bottom, they really don't care.
[01:17:30.038 --> 01:17:32.300]  It's all about the almighty dollar for these guys.
[01:17:33.501 --> 01:17:35.443]  They don't even kill themselves, really.
[01:17:35.463 --> 01:17:36.163]  They don't care.
[01:17:36.183 --> 01:17:37.804]  They'll kill their mother for a dollar.
[01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:39.126]  I agree with you.
[01:17:39.166 --> 01:17:40.327]  Who's the call in Arizona?
[01:17:41.668 --> 01:17:42.969]  Mike in Arizona, go ahead.
[01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:45.311]  Yes, hi Alex.
[01:17:45.631 --> 01:17:45.791]  Hello.
[01:17:47.682 --> 01:18:08.872]  My understanding, a friend of mine, a retired pilot who flew all these planes that were involved, the very planes in fact, he said it's not coincidence that the 757 and 767, I think were the models involved, are specifically the models that were designed to be flown via remote control.
[01:18:08.892 --> 01:18:10.613]  Do you have any knowledge of that?
[01:18:10.733 --> 01:18:14.194]  I have read that on official industry websites, but go ahead Richard.
[01:18:14.694 --> 01:18:15.155]  Same here.
[01:18:16.813 --> 01:18:20.934]  They can't be flown remotely, and anybody thinks differently is fooling themselves.
[01:18:22.075 --> 01:18:23.295]  Okay, good.
[01:18:24.695 --> 01:18:26.636]  The other question is... I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:27.636]  Mike, stay there.
[01:18:27.676 --> 01:18:29.437]  We'll come back to you, then to Dan in Illinois.
[01:18:30.057 --> 01:18:31.157]  That'll be it for our guests.
[01:18:31.177 --> 01:18:32.758]  Then we've got another guest coming on.
[01:18:34.085 --> 01:18:37.069]  By the way, everybody wanted this 7 million number in the prisons.
[01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:39.412]  Well, another article today about it.
[01:18:39.472 --> 01:18:41.795]  Okay, 7 million and they say 6.9.
[01:18:42.496 --> 01:18:45.359]  I saw a Justice Department document a year ago that said 7 million.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.441]  We'll get to that too.
[01:18:46.461 --> 01:18:46.901]  Stay with us.
[01:18:52.873 --> 01:18:55.874]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:18:56.214 --> 01:19:05.037]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:19:05.357 --> 01:19:10.039]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:19:10.519 --> 01:19:17.226]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:19:17.627 --> 01:19:29.439]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:29.879 --> 01:19:34.344]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:20:01.161 --> 01:20:04.125]  Here's what real customers have to say about new hair.
[01:20:04.145 --> 01:20:07.871]  I've been using new hair for about three months with some excellent results.
[01:20:08.351 --> 01:20:12.756]  Around the second month, I noticed my hair was thicker, had more body, and a vibrant color.
[01:20:13.136 --> 01:20:16.140]  This is a great product that I will continually use.
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:19.924]  Since taking new hair, I noticed darker and less gray hair.
[01:20:20.164 --> 01:20:21.545]  My hair is growing phenomenally.
[01:20:21.946 --> 01:20:23.307]  It looks and feels healthier.
[01:20:23.868 --> 01:20:25.349]  I'd strongly recommend new hair.
[01:20:25.670 --> 01:20:27.732]  Stop the clock on your hair loss!

[01:20:51.682 --> 01:20:56.406]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:20:56.646 --> 01:21:00.068]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:02.750]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[01:21:03.010 --> 01:21:11.597]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[01:21:11.957 --> 01:21:17.741]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[01:21:18.001 --> 01:21:19.962]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[01:21:20.202 --> 01:21:27.125]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[01:21:27.485 --> 01:21:33.927]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[01:21:34.207 --> 01:21:41.510]  That's right, for a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[01:21:41.770 --> 01:21:46.241]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[01:21:46.342 --> 01:21:46.582]  That's 800-686-2237.

[01:21:54.105 --> 01:21:59.609]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:04.253]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:22:04.493 --> 01:22:11.519]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:11.899 --> 01:22:18.004]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:18.164 --> 01:22:19.365]  There are no side effects.
[01:22:19.705 --> 01:22:22.649]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:22:22.810 --> 01:22:24.832]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:22:25.153 --> 01:22:32.383]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:22:32.683 --> 01:22:36.108]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:22:39.769 --> 01:22:39.949]  866-885-6625.
[01:22:39.969 --> 01:22:40.910]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:41.170]  Call today.
[01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:47.292]  Alright, Mike, in Arizona, you're on the air with our friend, the military air traffic controller from SAC.
[01:23:06.679 --> 01:23:09.422]  Richard Franklin, go ahead Mike.
[01:23:10.263 --> 01:23:21.314]  Yeah, my understanding is that these pilots are trained to punch in either a four or five digit code if they sense a hijacking is about to take place.
[01:23:22.615 --> 01:23:30.463]  What do you think the chances are that none of the four crews involved could have managed to do that before being overtaken by guys with box cutters?
[01:23:31.741 --> 01:23:41.910]  Well, the problem they have is, and again, that was the lie they also perpetrated, and you do realize that the radar trails would have been on the hard drive of the screens, can be gone back and have them looked at.
[01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:43.611]  They can still be looked at right now.
[01:23:44.192 --> 01:23:49.917]  The controller should have asked them to squawk ident, if he believed there was a problem.
[01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:56.903]  I need you to squawk ident, in which case they would have put in the code at that time, which would have caused that airplane to flash as it went across the screen.
[01:23:56.943 --> 01:23:58.404]  We should be able to see that at this time.
[01:23:58.806 --> 01:24:01.554]  They should be able to show that to us right now on the hard drive.
[01:24:01.895 --> 01:24:05.244]  So unless they erase the hard drive, that information should still be out there.
[01:24:05.808 --> 01:24:16.435]  And yeah, they should have been, but if the hijackers knew to turn off the transponder, don't you think that the pilots assumed they were being hijacked, would have just reached down and turned on the code?
[01:24:16.556 --> 01:24:34.228]  Also, Richard, a key point you brought up, and I had read this as well, that for five years they keep all those tapes, and if there's an incident, ten years, but magically five different systems that were involved, different installations, they just say they shredded those, and that's the end of the discussion.
[01:24:34.588 --> 01:24:40.573]  Yeah, but they shredded them, but then you turn around and heard the conversations two weeks ago at the 9-11 Commission of the guys talking.
[01:24:40.833 --> 01:24:50.782]  Just like they said that all the firefighter radios malfunctioned, and then it turned out that was a lie and they declared national security.
[01:24:50.802 --> 01:24:51.122]  Go ahead.
[01:24:51.182 --> 01:24:51.923]  Right, right.
[01:24:52.023 --> 01:24:53.104]  And again, the same situation.
[01:24:53.324 --> 01:24:57.788]  You heard no air traffic control clutter on the guys talking on an air traffic control frequency.
[01:24:58.088 --> 01:25:01.291]  So there were no controllers talking to anyone else in the sky at that time.
[01:25:01.738 --> 01:25:05.339]  So therefore, those tapes were fabricated, but the tapes still exist, I'm guaranteeing you.
[01:25:05.399 --> 01:25:08.520]  But, the radar trails are on the hard drive.
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.601]  They're not on tape.
[01:25:10.101 --> 01:25:11.841]  That's on a hard drive, and you can still go back and retrieve those.
[01:25:11.861 --> 01:25:17.023]  Now, Richard, explain that to us, that again, on this channel, you would have heard lots of voices.
[01:25:17.503 --> 01:25:17.964]  Absolutely.
[01:25:17.984 --> 01:25:19.924]  You're talking to several airplanes at one time.
[01:25:19.944 --> 01:25:23.405]  You're giving control instructions to everybody on the same frequency.
[01:25:24.046 --> 01:25:26.306]  So everybody hears everything else that's going on with somebody else.
[01:25:26.326 --> 01:25:30.708]  So you don't duplicate your information, or somebody else can hear where this guy is, so he doesn't run into him.
[01:25:31.058 --> 01:25:35.339]  You would have heard this guy saying, look, I've got an aircraft out here that's not under my control.
[01:25:35.359 --> 01:25:37.860]  I believe there's a problem with him.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.682]  Let me give you a vector away from his area to make sure he doesn't get a run into.
[01:25:41.962 --> 01:25:43.482]  That conversation would have been heard.
[01:25:43.802 --> 01:25:52.465]  But at the same time, you should have seen aircraft going across on the hard drive, on the radar hard drive, to see the guy sitting there flashing that he's already been hijacked.
[01:25:52.805 --> 01:25:55.947]  And at one point, I remember what the code was, but I don't want to go off into it right now.
[01:25:56.047 --> 01:25:57.107]  Again, national security.
[01:25:57.706 --> 01:26:02.127]  They might be at my front door any moment now behind this, but that aircraft should have been flashed and hijacked.
[01:26:02.448 --> 01:26:06.889]  They should have asked him to squawk his ID code.
[01:26:08.409 --> 01:26:10.010]  Okay, Mike, does that answer your question?
[01:26:10.330 --> 01:26:10.890]  That sure does.
[01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:12.271]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[01:26:12.991 --> 01:26:14.331]  Let's talk to Dan in Illinois.
[01:26:14.371 --> 01:26:15.112]  Dan, go ahead.
[01:26:16.232 --> 01:26:18.733]  Yeah, Richard, I can tell you're an absolute expert at what you do.
[01:26:18.753 --> 01:26:19.813]  There's no question about it.
[01:26:20.813 --> 01:26:21.314]  Your background.
[01:26:23.157 --> 01:26:28.298]  Have you read the propaganda in the NORAD website about this?
[01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:29.758]  No, I haven't.
[01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:30.298]  Sorry.
[01:26:30.819 --> 01:26:41.901]  It says, until the morning of September 11, 2001, NORAD's focus was almost exclusively on threats coming toward the Canadian and American borders, not terrorism in our domestic airspace.
[01:26:42.861 --> 01:26:47.982]  Because of that day, now NORAD is a terrorist type of thing.
[01:26:49.689 --> 01:26:51.671]  But again, that's after the fact.
[01:26:51.731 --> 01:26:53.873]  It really has nothing to do with this specific incident.
[01:26:54.914 --> 01:26:58.557]  Although you can focus on one thing, you still don't break for procedure.
[01:26:58.657 --> 01:27:00.359]  And we went through these procedures, and let me tell you something.
[01:27:00.379 --> 01:27:03.441]  My ex-wife and I haven't agreed on anything until we got to this one point.
[01:27:04.162 --> 01:27:05.123]  Therefore, I know I'm right.
[01:27:05.303 --> 01:27:06.864]  All the stars are aligned on this one.
[01:27:07.205 --> 01:27:12.509]  She said the exact same thing, and she works for an airline right now, and said something at a meeting, and they told her to shut up.
[01:27:13.130 --> 01:27:15.472]  At that meeting, she's been since demoted.
[01:27:16.095 --> 01:27:19.996]  Alright, I don't know if that has anything to do with this or not, but she's no longer in the position she was in.
[01:27:20.036 --> 01:27:25.337]  She asked some questions about why they weren't being dispatched from the closest airbase.
[01:27:25.697 --> 01:27:26.817]  We have standard procedures.
[01:27:26.837 --> 01:27:27.977]  We don't ask questions.
[01:27:28.357 --> 01:27:30.077]  We just react to the situation.
[01:27:30.357 --> 01:27:31.558]  You don't have time to do that.
[01:27:31.578 --> 01:27:34.118]  You can't be emotional about your job as an air traffic controller.
[01:27:34.158 --> 01:27:44.880]  This all flew against the policy since 1958, and when your Cessna goes off course, they launch F-16s, but four planes are going wild for two hours and nothing happens.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:45.740]  Absolutely.
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:46.761]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:27:47.021 --> 01:27:47.861]  We wouldn't go through it.
[01:27:48.102 --> 01:27:49.022]  We don't ask questions.
[01:27:49.062 --> 01:27:52.084]  We don't call a supervisor and say, the guy's off course right there, what should I do?
[01:27:52.544 --> 01:27:54.965]  We just do and then after the fact we'll talk about it.
[01:27:55.685 --> 01:27:56.666]  Like an alarm goes off.
[01:27:57.046 --> 01:28:08.572]  Anyway, what I was going to say too was that that's the biggest, I think the biggest evil thing that's come out of this 9-11 Commission is that the United States needs prior knowledge
[01:28:09.873 --> 01:28:10.914]  It can never be surprised.
[01:28:10.974 --> 01:28:13.315]  In other words, there's no defense against a surprise attack.
[01:28:13.335 --> 01:28:15.777]  I think that's the most evil thing that came out of it.
[01:28:15.797 --> 01:28:16.057]  I hear you.
[01:28:16.137 --> 01:28:16.918]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:17.198 --> 01:28:21.681]  Richard Franklin, I want to get you back on, maybe even later this week, because this is a big issue.
[01:28:21.701 --> 01:28:23.403]  We need to flesh it all out.
[01:28:23.903 --> 01:28:29.747]  And I appreciate your courage, and I appreciate you coming on to talk about just this ridiculous cover-up we've been witnessing.
[01:28:30.167 --> 01:28:30.968]  I appreciate you, Alex.
[01:28:30.988 --> 01:28:31.808]  I appreciate that a lot.
[01:28:32.049 --> 01:28:32.989]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:37.392]  Folks, their official story is completely impossible.
[01:28:37.552 --> 01:28:38.193]  It's a fraud.
[01:28:38.743 --> 01:28:40.928]  We'll be right back, Stay with us.
[01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:43.453]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.954 --> 01:28:45.557]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.479 --> 01:28:49.164]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.174 --> 01:28:55.476]  The sun is getting brighter and the days are getting longer.
[01:28:55.676 --> 01:28:56.997]  Summer's just around the corner.
[01:28:57.217 --> 01:28:58.459]  What are your plans for it?
[01:28:58.759 --> 01:28:59.159]  Fishing?
[01:28:59.419 --> 01:28:59.860]  Gardening?
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:00.340]  Camping?
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:02.682]  I'm sure you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors.
[01:29:02.902 --> 01:29:06.085]  And I'm sure the ticks and mosquitoes will spend more time enjoying you.
[01:29:06.305 --> 01:29:08.667]  It's not just itching and scratching we have to worry about.
[01:29:08.947 --> 01:29:12.330]  Now there's incurable illnesses like Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.
[01:29:12.671 --> 01:29:17.775]  Deet is proven to keep the bugs away, but it's also proven to cause brain damage in laboratory animals.
[01:29:18.115 --> 01:29:20.596]  That's not a choice I want to make, and I don't have to.
[01:29:20.776 --> 01:29:23.918]  Thanks to Natural Answer, available at NaturalAnswer.com.

[01:30:54.003 --> 01:30:55.004]  Spring has arrived!
[01:30:55.184 --> 01:30:58.147]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:58.367 --> 01:31:01.810]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:10.197]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:32:02.509 --> 01:32:04.070]  Don't forget the websites, folks.
[01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:10.972]  There's Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:12.773 --> 01:32:17.815]  And the military-industrial complex is trying to turn the planet into a giant prison.
[01:32:19.396 --> 01:32:30.220]  And the private individuals in the Carlyle Group and other institutions say in their own policy reports that they're going to use the threat of terrorism to take all of our freedoms and feed the economy through their greedy hands.
[01:32:32.078 --> 01:32:56.231]  And in Boston, they have thousands of police, military, people aiming live-fire machine guns at them, military helicopters, and I'm looking at photos and video clips here in front of me, of protest cages, small cages, underneath, understand, under, and this is on InfoWars.com right now,
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:02.404]  Underneath the train station, where no one is at, where people are put in cages to protest.
[01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:04.245]  Where no one can see them.
[01:33:04.606 --> 01:33:12.771]  Now the news will show you barbed wire fences, tall, 30 foot, 25 foot fences with barbed wire facing in so people can't climb over.
[01:33:13.192 --> 01:33:16.854]  That's around the center where they're having the convention.
[01:33:18.255 --> 01:33:25.861]  But people that want to protest, they're behind that in little cages they put them in.
[01:33:26.849 --> 01:33:29.832]  Now, this is what America has turned into?
[01:33:29.872 --> 01:33:39.121]  We're not America anymore if we don't have our God-given freedoms, our civil liberties, whatever you want to call it, to go out and protest.
[01:33:39.141 --> 01:33:47.870]  And I've had the people on this show, conservatives, liberals, who go out with a sign saying, no blood for oil, and there's 500 Bush supporters,
[01:33:49.475 --> 01:34:00.800]  On a street, and the police come over and arrest them, and they're charged with felonies and are convicted, and saying, no one's allowed to disagree, you have to go a mile away to the inside of a stadium, where no media is allowed, by the way, to stand there with your sign.
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:01.580]  It's a joke!
[01:34:03.781 --> 01:34:17.226]  And on top of this, last year, on the eve of a war, I had the lawyer, a city attorney on, no criminal record, 50-something years old, bought a shirt at the mall that said, Peace on Earth.
[01:34:17.941 --> 01:34:23.003]  They thought that was an evil t-shirt, wouldn't matter what it was, and arrested him.
[01:34:25.484 --> 01:34:26.784]  Arrested him.
[01:34:28.045 --> 01:34:38.489]  So, and sickos like Michael Wiener, known as Mr. Savage, get up on the air every day and say, put anybody who disagrees with the government in a camp.
[01:34:39.833 --> 01:34:40.673]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[01:34:40.773 --> 01:34:43.734]  In a camp, we had Senator Menace in Oregon.
[01:34:43.754 --> 01:34:45.795]  This is posted on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:34:46.155 --> 01:34:52.197]  Introduced a law, almost passed, that said if you block traffic in a protest, you've got life in prison.
[01:34:53.977 --> 01:34:55.397]  This is what they're trying to do.
[01:34:55.497 --> 01:34:57.278]  I mean, I can't believe how bad it is.
[01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:59.479]  I appreciate her holding while I introduce this.
[01:35:00.059 --> 01:35:04.140]  She is Carol Rose, Executive Director of the ACLU of Massachusetts.
[01:35:05.007 --> 01:35:07.488]  And she's joining us now from Boston.
[01:35:07.848 --> 01:35:09.189]  Carol, good to have you on with us.
[01:35:09.469 --> 01:35:10.589]  It's good to be here, Alex.
[01:35:10.649 --> 01:35:11.729]  Thanks for the invitation.
[01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:23.174]  Well, I'm really concerned about what's happening, and mainly these are conservative protesters who aren't allowed to protest, but it's going to be the Democrats who can't protest in New York.
[01:35:23.454 --> 01:35:25.754]  It has nothing to do with keeping us safe from terrorists.
[01:35:26.075 --> 01:35:27.035]  What is going on?
[01:35:27.615 --> 01:35:28.335]  Well, absolutely.
[01:35:28.375 --> 01:35:30.416]  It has nothing to do with keeping us safe from terrorists.
[01:35:30.516 --> 01:35:35.258]  I mean, everybody agrees that we want to have sufficient security to prevent another terrorism attack.
[01:35:35.579 --> 01:35:40.901]  But the kind of things that are taking place here in Boston for the Democratic Convention aren't really aimed at that.
[01:35:41.581 --> 01:35:47.384]  What they're worried about is the fact that they don't want to have a lot of the message being heard by the delegates.
[01:35:47.464 --> 01:35:53.907]  They're really trying to isolate the delegates from the other people who, you know, want to have their protest voices being heard.
[01:35:53.927 --> 01:35:54.547]  So it's really
[01:35:55.598 --> 01:36:03.847]  Really dramatic, they put up what the judge, when we challenged the so-called free speech zone, the judge himself called it an internment camp.
[01:36:04.608 --> 01:36:14.499]  There's razor wire all the way around, there's netting above, there's two rows of fences around the area, and there's railroad tracks overhanging the whole thing.
[01:36:14.878 --> 01:36:19.582]  So it really does have the feel of an internment camp, which is what the federal judge himself described it as.
[01:36:19.982 --> 01:36:21.843]  Now, where can we find his comments?
[01:36:21.883 --> 01:36:22.864]  I'd like to link to those.
[01:36:22.904 --> 01:36:26.567]  Are those going to be on the ACLU Mass website?
[01:36:26.627 --> 01:36:33.912]  Yep, it's ACLU-MASS.org, and we've put it up there, and he calls it an affront to the spirit of the First Amendment.
[01:36:34.292 --> 01:36:36.634]  Do me a favor, say that slowly for listeners.
[01:36:36.774 --> 01:36:37.395]  Absolutely.
[01:36:37.475 --> 01:36:39.296]  It's www.ACLU-MASS.org.
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:53.089]  Okay, now I want to commend the ACLU because in the past, if it was conservative groups having their rights violated, sometimes state chappers wouldn't help.
[01:36:53.589 --> 01:36:54.811]  I did see a little bit of that.
[01:36:55.251 --> 01:37:02.079]  But I have to tell you, these are mainly conservative protesters and a lot of what you'd call liberals and libertarians that are protesting.
[01:37:04.597 --> 01:37:16.522]  For those that haven't seen the video, and the news isn't showing half of this, I mean, this is 25, 30 foot fences, then underneath a train station where no one can even see you, they then lock you inside cages.
[01:37:16.582 --> 01:37:19.523]  I mean, and then the judge calls it an internment camp.
[01:37:20.443 --> 01:37:22.144]  Right, and nonetheless he upholds it.
[01:37:22.524 --> 01:37:27.106]  I mean, this is going on at the same time as we're having just an extraordinary police presence.
[01:37:27.146 --> 01:37:28.706]  The National Guard has been called out.
[01:37:29.327 --> 01:37:32.548]  They're searching people who ride the trains, the subway systems.
[01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:34.711]  So really this is just training us how to be slaves?
[01:37:59.864 --> 01:38:00.465]  Well, that's right.
[01:38:00.485 --> 01:38:09.111]  And you know, one of the real concerns that I have is that, you know, down by the Convention Center, you know, there are really the accommodations being made for the media.
[01:38:09.131 --> 01:38:12.794]  There's accommodations being made for the delegates and all the party bigwigs.
[01:38:13.295 --> 01:38:19.740]  But there isn't an accommodation being made for the average citizen, you know, a resident of this country who wants to have his or her voice heard.
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:28.407]  And one of my surprising things was I was out at the historic town of Lexington over the weekend and asked to give some remarks because some of the delegates were going to be coming out
[01:38:28.945 --> 01:38:32.648]  To Lexington, which is a very bucolic and sort of beautiful New England town.
[01:38:33.228 --> 01:38:34.990]  And they put up a free speech pen there!
[01:38:35.686 --> 01:38:37.247]  Thinking that this is the new way to do it.
[01:38:37.487 --> 01:38:41.048]  And there was no evidence or suggestion that there was any kind of a security threat.
[01:38:41.088 --> 01:38:44.489]  And basically this says, anybody protesting is really a criminal.
[01:38:44.989 --> 01:38:48.651]  We're going to go ahead and put them in their own special little ghettos.
[01:38:49.071 --> 01:38:51.332]  This is the type of stuff they did in Nazi Germany.
[01:38:51.552 --> 01:38:52.132]  Well, that's right.
[01:38:52.292 --> 01:38:57.294]  And the concern that I want everybody to understand is, of course, all of the United States is a free speech zone.
[01:38:57.354 --> 01:38:58.934]  That's what this country is built on.
[01:38:59.174 --> 01:39:01.375]  And this is meant to be a chilling effect, is it not?
[01:39:01.715 --> 01:39:03.916]  Well, you know, we don't... They say they're doing it
[01:39:04.666 --> 01:39:08.910]  You know, for security purposes, but it doesn't seem to serve any security purposes.
[01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:15.056]  Certainly putting people into a small area creates a safety hazard, security hazard, if anything.
[01:39:15.576 --> 01:39:23.623]  And we've gotten calls from security experts and public health experts expressing concern about the lack of safety in these very small and enclosed spaces.
[01:39:24.024 --> 01:39:27.066]  So I don't think that there's really a legitimate security argument here.
[01:39:27.126 --> 01:39:28.407]  It just seems to be almost
[01:39:29.534 --> 01:39:32.035]  Nothing else, maybe a PR move to say, look, we're doing something.
[01:39:32.255 --> 01:39:38.856]  Can you explain to me, I'm looking at photos here, so you're behind a big fence and they have a little cage they have you get in.
[01:39:39.437 --> 01:39:40.317]  This is insane!
[01:39:41.177 --> 01:39:47.879]  Well, it certainly goes against the spirit of the First Amendment, and I would suggest it should be, the judge should have ruled that it went against the letter of the law as well.
[01:39:47.899 --> 01:39:52.280]  Well, they're acting like somebody who wants to protest is a fire-breathing lunatic.
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:55.761]  Well, right, and you know, a lot of these people are, you know,
[01:39:56.288 --> 01:39:56.748]  Yes, I think so.
[01:40:13.104 --> 01:40:13.565]  I don't know.
[01:40:28.958 --> 01:40:43.469]  I mean, Carol, are you familiar that in Seattle, the government actually hired provocateurs to kind of set this precedent of, oh, look, things get out of control, and then how they infiltrate with police into these different groups who they've caught in Miami and D.C.
[01:40:43.569 --> 01:40:44.890]  actually causing problems?
[01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:46.191]  Right here, going in and instigating.
[01:40:46.211 --> 01:40:47.351]  Well, you know, it's interesting here.
[01:40:47.411 --> 01:40:56.438]  We had a, one of the cases that the ACLU won, there was another group that wanted to have a peaceful protest right in front of the Fleet Center on Sunday, the day before the convention.
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:04.590]  And the city had ruled that they weren't allowed to, even though it was, you know, down the street on a public street on the day before the convention even started.
[01:41:05.210 --> 01:41:10.477]  And we went in and we said no, you know, we said to the court that they should have a right to march down in front of the Fleet Center.
[01:41:10.537 --> 01:41:12.459]  And in fact, they were granted that.
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:13.341]  We won that case.
[01:41:13.461 --> 01:41:15.924]  And they had their peaceful march yesterday on Sunday.
[01:41:16.371 --> 01:41:17.332]  And nothing went wrong.
[01:41:17.372 --> 01:41:25.839]  There were a bunch of people from a wide range of political views out there, about a couple thousand people marching down in front of the convention center, and nothing went wrong.
[01:41:25.879 --> 01:41:27.320]  And that's what this country is about.
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:29.902]  People should have a right to express themselves peacefully.
[01:41:29.922 --> 01:41:31.703]  Well, I agree with you, Carol.
[01:41:31.723 --> 01:41:33.685]  But, Carol, they're not going to stop here.
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:36.081]  Okay, I mean, take Georgia.
[01:41:36.141 --> 01:41:47.248]  They announced that half the state, and this was the governor, was under a civil emergency or martial law and would not allow protest in whole counties until people like yourself sued.
[01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:50.870]  Then they said, okay, we'll allow you to protest in little cages again.
[01:41:51.611 --> 01:41:51.791]  Right.
[01:41:51.851 --> 01:42:01.897]  Well, I think it's incumbent upon all of us to continue not only to work in the courts, which is certainly where the ACLU does a lot of its work, but also to work in our state legislatures, to work with our police departments,
[01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:06.179]  And in Congress, and to continue to push and to say, this is not acceptable to us.
[01:42:06.259 --> 01:42:09.166]  This is anti-American to put people into cages.
[01:42:09.246 --> 01:42:11.271]  America itself is a free speech zone.
[01:42:11.693 --> 01:42:13.214]  Certainly, relative to the rest of the world.
[01:42:13.274 --> 01:42:16.355]  And to give that up, we're giving up a fundamental American value.
[01:42:16.395 --> 01:42:19.137]  Well, yeah, America isn't even worth defending if we don't have this.
[01:42:19.177 --> 01:42:20.257]  Plus, it doesn't make us safe.
[01:42:20.298 --> 01:42:20.798]  It's a joke.
[01:42:21.198 --> 01:42:22.939]  But, Carol, I've got two questions for you.
[01:42:22.959 --> 01:42:24.160]  You're obviously an expert on this.
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:27.561]  Again, you're the Executive Director of the ACLU of Massachusetts.
[01:42:27.581 --> 01:42:28.402]  We're honored to have you.
[01:42:28.682 --> 01:42:31.723]  Website, aclu-mass.org.
[01:42:31.763 --> 01:42:34.765]  We'll put a link to that on my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:42:34.785 --> 01:42:36.046]  But I'm trying to understand something here.
[01:42:39.694 --> 01:42:42.056]  In DC, they've done stuff like this.
[01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:43.657]  In Miami, they've done stuff like this.
[01:42:43.697 --> 01:42:45.018]  They've attacked innocent people.
[01:42:45.578 --> 01:42:53.343]  And then now, even in New York, two weeks ago, the police commissioner said, we may not allow police to protest.
[01:42:53.383 --> 01:42:55.364]  You may lose your job if you protest.
[01:42:55.664 --> 01:43:05.951]  We've had dozens of colleges say, if you speak one word during commencements or during graduation, you are going to have your diploma taken.
[01:43:06.171 --> 01:43:06.831]  I mean, this is a
[01:43:08.311 --> 01:43:09.292]  Scary development.
[01:43:09.472 --> 01:43:10.412]  Can you speak to that?
[01:43:10.713 --> 01:43:11.053]  Well, yeah.
[01:43:11.073 --> 01:43:15.756]  I mean, I think there's a mood across the entire country which is that somehow dissent is unpatriotic.
[01:43:16.116 --> 01:43:24.361]  But of course, you know, we know here in Massachusetts where the, you know, the first Patriots stood up and spoke out against the oppression of the British crown.
[01:43:24.661 --> 01:43:27.343]  The dissent is actually a deep American tradition.
[01:43:27.683 --> 01:43:29.785]  And the dissent is actually a patriotic thing.
[01:43:29.805 --> 01:43:35.028]  That we have not only a right but a duty to criticize our government when we don't agree with what the government is doing.
[01:43:35.410 --> 01:43:39.992]  And the ACLU is here about defending the right to dissent, regardless of the political view you take.
[01:43:40.052 --> 01:43:40.592]  I don't care.
[01:43:40.892 --> 01:43:43.013]  What we want is the right to dissent itself.
[01:43:43.073 --> 01:43:53.196]  And when that fundamental right to exercise your political views, whatever they may be, is threatened, then we're really seeing a sea change in what this country is all about.
[01:43:53.726 --> 01:44:08.119]  And I feel very strongly that right now at this time when we are under assault with fear in the country of domestic terrorism, that this is the time to rededicate ourselves to the American values, the things that make us unique in this country.
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:15.366]  And certainly freedom of speech, freedom of association, things like that are so fundamental to who we are as a people and as a country.
[01:44:15.751 --> 01:44:18.733]  That these are the values that we need to fight for, perhaps above all others.
[01:44:18.993 --> 01:44:44.889]  Well, Carol Rose, you're there in Boston right now, and from the news images, troops aiming heavy machine guns with loaded live rounds at the population, checkpoints everywhere, police in black ski masks and black helmets, armored vehicles driving around, Homeland Security, helicopters... On a helicopter overhead of my office, and I apologize if there's a lot of background noise, that's a military helicopter right outside my office.
[01:44:46.041 --> 01:44:48.863]  Well, so describe the atmosphere.
[01:44:48.884 --> 01:44:52.747]  I mean, what are the citizens of Boston saying about all this?
[01:44:53.307 --> 01:44:55.830]  Well, there are a lot of people who have just left town.
[01:44:56.330 --> 01:44:58.552]  Their free speech rights have been killed.
[01:44:58.572 --> 01:44:59.933]  They're not even coming into Boston.
[01:45:00.333 --> 01:45:03.496]  So this morning when I came into town, for example, there was very little traffic.
[01:45:04.137 --> 01:45:06.559]  And the parking lots are empty because people are just staying away.
[01:45:06.899 --> 01:45:10.162]  But the people who do want to exercise their political speech rights, they're nervous.
[01:45:11.117 --> 01:45:26.887]  They're courageous in going forward and trying to do so, but I think it's really put a damper on the whole political process when we end up with a convention, whether here or in New York, where we have something created for TV, but not really reflecting the American people.
[01:45:26.907 --> 01:45:27.927]  This does something else.
[01:45:28.728 --> 01:45:29.728]  I agree with you.
[01:45:31.542 --> 01:45:47.515]  takes the focus off the message of the convention itself and focuses it into this giant police state uh... advertisement desensitization campaign as you said than even smaller towns outside boston mimic the police state so can you talk about both those points?
[01:45:48.015 --> 01:45:48.575]  Well, right.
[01:45:48.615 --> 01:45:54.320]  I think it's important that we realize that everybody says well this is special this is just for a national security special event but
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:57.983]  I mean, two of the things that aren't going to be permanent.
[01:45:58.003 --> 01:46:07.311]  Well, one of the things is that when other towns and cities start to mimic this thing, every time there's any kind of a public parade or a public free speech exercise, that suddenly you have to put a cage around it.
[01:46:07.371 --> 01:46:08.932]  That's a terribly chilling thing.
[01:46:09.553 --> 01:46:19.101]  I think the other thing we have concerns here in Boston is they've brought in thousands of new surveillance cameras to be able to track people's movements literally as they move across the city.
[01:46:19.525 --> 01:46:22.149]  And one of our concerns is that they've said that's going to be permanent.
[01:46:22.269 --> 01:46:24.493]  That once they've set the infrastructure into place...
[01:46:24.909 --> 01:46:27.450]  They're not going to dismantle it once the convention is over.
[01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:29.852]  And it's not for terrorists, it's for the general public.
[01:46:29.872 --> 01:46:33.393]  Homeland Security, a billion-two is going to be spent just in New York.
[01:46:33.453 --> 01:46:40.817]  Now Homeland Security says we fight terror and crime, saying in Section 802 of the Patriot Act that all crime is terror.
[01:46:40.837 --> 01:46:52.363]  That's right, and we know that much of the executive branch authority, the police power that's been taken out of the Patriot Act, in fact hasn't been used in terrorism cases, but more often than not it's being used in just typical criminal cases.
[01:46:52.904 --> 01:47:02.306]  And you know, the good law enforcement people, and there are many of them out there, they know that the Constitution protects them just as it protects the regular citizens.
[01:47:02.346 --> 01:47:04.107]  Well, let me talk about that.
[01:47:04.327 --> 01:47:05.727]  What about the police commissioner?
[01:47:05.767 --> 01:47:09.288]  Did you see that, where he told the police they might lose their jobs if they protest?
[01:47:10.328 --> 01:47:13.989]  Well, that had a lot to do with the union battle going on here in Boston.
[01:47:14.009 --> 01:47:17.430]  There was that kind of an issue, because the police union was going to strike.
[01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:22.471]  And I didn't see that here, and I'm not sure if it happened elsewhere, but here I think
[01:47:23.292 --> 01:47:30.536]  The bigger issue is that the Boston Police Department has a history of actually being very progressive and very effective at community-based policing.
[01:47:30.956 --> 01:47:37.059]  I'd hate to see them go in a different direction because suddenly they've gotten a different lesson out of the Democratic Convention.
[01:47:37.239 --> 01:47:41.701]  Have you had any issues where, like in Miami, where they just savagely beat up innocent people?
[01:47:42.242 --> 01:47:43.282]  So far, we haven't.
[01:47:43.322 --> 01:47:44.903]  We're on our first day of the convention.
[01:47:45.439 --> 01:47:51.223]  And as far as we have heard to date, we have not had any incidents of police brutality and we hope to keep it that way.
[01:47:51.323 --> 01:48:03.311]  Now, CIA officers, FBI officers have been on record in mainstream publications for two years saying they've been ordered to issue fake terror alerts to distract away from the administration's activities.
[01:48:03.792 --> 01:48:05.513]  They're clearly doing that here again.
[01:48:05.533 --> 01:48:13.678]  This cynical action of telling the media they're the target is to now get the media embedded with the militarized police and the military.
[01:48:13.698 --> 01:48:14.459]  Do you agree with that?
[01:48:15.524 --> 01:48:25.981]  You know, it's hard for me to state whether or not that's actually happening, but we certainly recently brought a suit saying that merely because there's a high terrorism alert, you don't suddenly have a right to search people without probable cause.
[01:48:26.357 --> 01:48:34.400]  I mean, one of our concerns is these new alert levels will be used to actually say, during an orange alert, let's say, you don't have any Fourth Amendment right to be free from an unreasonable search.
[01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:35.321]  Oh, I've got to stop you!
[01:48:35.481 --> 01:48:36.141]  I've got to stop you!
[01:48:36.201 --> 01:48:46.385]  The New Jersey State FEMA coordinator head, Sid Casperson, said last year in the Net News Service, that under a red alert, your rights are stripped.
[01:48:46.425 --> 01:48:46.966]  That's a quote.
[01:48:47.226 --> 01:48:50.067]  You will be considered an enemy combatant if you leave your home.
[01:48:50.931 --> 01:48:55.615]  Wow, that's really extraordinary and I certainly hope that would be, you know, knocked down by the courts.
[01:48:56.015 --> 01:48:58.617]  I mean, that's the kind of thing that we simply can't allow to happen.
[01:48:58.657 --> 01:49:04.241]  We had a very similar case here in Massachusetts where somebody tried to do that during a heightened alert.
[01:49:04.261 --> 01:49:05.742]  They didn't yet call it an orange alert.
[01:49:06.423 --> 01:49:09.685]  And we've recently had that struck down by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.
[01:49:09.705 --> 01:49:12.047]  So we're going to have to work in the courts, but it's not enough.
[01:49:12.167 --> 01:49:17.891]  I think the average American citizens have to educate themselves about what's going on and themselves take action.
[01:49:17.952 --> 01:49:18.472]  I will tell you,
[01:49:18.905 --> 01:49:21.466]  You know, people in Congress listen when their constituents call them.
[01:49:21.987 --> 01:49:28.550]  And sometimes they listen when the ACLU calls, and sometimes they listen when the courts call, but they always listen when their constituents call.
[01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:35.013]  So it's really incumbent upon every American, every resident of this country, to take action and let their voice be heard.
[01:49:35.133 --> 01:49:36.714]  Okay, Carol, we got a break.
[01:49:36.774 --> 01:49:37.954]  I want to thank you for coming on.
[01:49:38.034 --> 01:49:40.536]  Carol Rose, Executive Director of the ACLU in Mass.
[01:49:41.036 --> 01:49:44.017]  Thanks for coming on and take care, and I hope to get you back on as this develops.
[01:49:44.097 --> 01:49:44.577]  I appreciate it.
[01:49:44.597 --> 01:49:45.418]  I always like to listen to you.
[01:49:45.438 --> 01:49:45.818]  Thank you.
[01:49:45.978 --> 01:49:46.418]  Take care.
[01:49:46.598 --> 01:49:47.519]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:49:52.466 --> 01:49:56.793]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:56.973 --> 01:50:01.400]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:05.927]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:05.967 --> 01:50:07.329]  The New World Order.
[01:50:08.130 --> 01:50:08.831]  Hannah Murray.
[01:50:09.091 --> 01:50:13.316]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:13.376 --> 01:50:20.304]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:20.444 --> 01:50:22.447]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:22.827 --> 01:50:33.210]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:38.792]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:50:51.816 --> 01:50:58.039]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:50:58.199 --> 01:51:04.362]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:04.642 --> 01:51:13.086]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:13.326 --> 01:51:20.349]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:20.649 --> 01:51:25.472]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:25.692 --> 01:51:31.096]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:31.436 --> 01:51:34.518]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:34.859 --> 01:51:42.764]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:53.230]  I think so.
[01:52:08.135 --> 01:52:08.796]  We're good to go!
[01:52:37.674 --> 01:52:40.759]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:40.919 --> 01:52:46.788]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:04.535 --> 01:53:07.718]  Alright, we're going to break in a few minutes to start the third hour.
[01:53:07.738 --> 01:53:12.141]  We've got a Ben, Dan, Roger, and many others that are holding.
[01:53:12.161 --> 01:53:19.166]  We've got several other guests who are on the ground right now under Police State Central in Boston coming on too later in the next hour.
[01:53:19.647 --> 01:53:24.651]  We have the precedent for total martial law being set up whenever they go up to orange or red level alerts.
[01:53:25.291 --> 01:53:26.872]  That's what this is all about, folks.
[01:53:27.193 --> 01:53:31.376]  And I told you back in Seattle, this is a test case to set the precedent.
[01:53:32.668 --> 01:53:34.369]  I want to cover some news right now.
[01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:37.452]  Then we'll break, as I said, and go back to your calls.
[01:53:39.213 --> 01:53:51.443]  If you do support this broadcast, if you do believe in what we're doing, if you want to warn people and have tools that will effectively wake people up in a big way, I have made two amazing films concerning who really carried out September 11th.
[01:53:51.463 --> 01:53:54.245]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and The Masters of Terror.
[01:53:55.177 --> 01:53:57.298]  Both of those are over two hours long.
[01:53:57.439 --> 01:53:59.640]  They're $25.95 apiece.
[01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:17.071]  $20 if you get three or more of any of the ten films I've made, like America Destroyed by Design, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, $18 discount when you get three of the tapes, $24 discount when you get four of the tapes, and so on.
[01:54:17.091 --> 01:54:21.574]  We've got a bunch of other great new 9-11 films by other wonderful researchers.
[01:54:22.481 --> 01:54:26.163]  Like 9-11 The Great Illusion, 9-11 Painful Deceptions.
[01:54:26.943 --> 01:54:30.504]  They're incredible pieces of work you've got to get out to people.
[01:54:30.945 --> 01:54:33.946]  You're authorized to make copies of the videos I've produced, by the way.
[01:54:34.706 --> 01:54:35.947]  The films that have my name on it.
[01:54:36.607 --> 01:54:38.848]  We've got a bunch of books, a bunch of books on tape.
[01:54:39.268 --> 01:54:48.212]  Go peruse the Secure Safe Shopping Cart at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or PrisonPlanet.tv or simply give me a call toll-free
[01:54:49.079 --> 01:54:49.499]  At 1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:49.519 --> 01:54:50.159]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:54:50.219 --> 01:54:55.621]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[01:54:55.741 --> 01:54:57.182]  The ball is in your court, folks.
[01:54:57.322 --> 01:54:57.662]  All right.
[01:54:58.042 --> 01:55:02.124]  For decades, the government has been caught, the World Health Organization with the UN, adding
[01:55:18.217 --> 01:55:22.980]  Hormones to vaccines, so the body then attacks the cerebral cortex in babies.
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:27.662]  This gives you an IQ reduction, they want to dumb down population, they've been caught doing it.
[01:55:28.963 --> 01:55:30.024]  Hard to believe, huh?
[01:55:30.144 --> 01:55:31.965]  Here's the London Independent today.
[01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:35.192]  Children to get jabs against drug addiction.
[01:55:35.212 --> 01:55:39.095]  See, now we're going to change your brain chemistry so you won't be angry.
[01:55:39.215 --> 01:55:43.138]  So they have those new vaccines to psychologically brain damage you.
[01:55:43.158 --> 01:55:46.480]  Well, this new one is children to get jabs against drug addiction.
[01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:49.302]  Ministers consider vaccination scheme.
[01:55:49.823 --> 01:55:51.864]  Heroin, cocaine, and nicotine targeted.
[01:55:52.825 --> 01:55:55.587]  A radical scheme to vaccinate children against future drug addiction.
[01:55:55.667 --> 01:55:57.469]  It changes the brain chemistry, folks.
[01:55:57.909 --> 01:56:00.511]  It's being considered by ministers, The Independent said on Sunday.
[01:56:01.309 --> 01:56:05.291]  Under the plans, doctors would immunize children at risk for becoming smokers.
[01:56:05.311 --> 01:56:08.333]  Oh, you're poor, we're going to make you take it because you'll probably end up on it.
[01:56:08.673 --> 01:56:11.495]  Or drug users with an injection.
[01:56:12.295 --> 01:56:16.038]  Again, people who may become, who may use drugs when they're little babies.
[01:56:16.418 --> 01:56:21.181]  The scheme could operate on a similar way to the current nationwide measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination program.
[01:56:21.581 --> 01:56:27.044]  Childhood immunization would provide adults with protection from euphoria that is experienced by users.
[01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:34.529]  Now, they then go on to admit this drug shuts down your capability to have endorphins.
[01:56:35.650 --> 01:56:39.054]  It actually goes in and binds with the receptors.
[01:56:39.655 --> 01:56:41.016]  Folks, this is a lobotomy!
[01:56:44.098 --> 01:56:47.960]  Drugs make you feel euphoric because you naturally have those feelings.
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:59.805]  When you do get on a test, when you have your first child, when you get a raise, when you accept the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, you get euphoria.
[01:57:00.065 --> 01:57:06.848]  When you get a date with that good-looking woman when you're in college who's really smart and cool and you want to go out with her, that's what it's all about.
[01:57:07.608 --> 01:57:09.309]  I'm high all the time on endorphins.
[01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:10.389]  I don't need drugs.
[01:57:11.049 --> 01:57:12.530]  And it goes on to say
[01:57:13.348 --> 01:57:19.492]  That the pharmacological system will change the brain chemistry.
[01:57:19.952 --> 01:57:22.094]  Folks, this is so incredible.
[01:57:23.114 --> 01:57:24.215]  Right out in the open.
[01:57:25.236 --> 01:57:26.477]  And they're going to make them take it!
[01:57:26.757 --> 01:57:28.018]  And they're going to make you take it.
[01:57:28.758 --> 01:57:30.859]  After you have this shot, you'll be one of us.
[01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:34.342]  Oh, but once you're depressed, we'll have some Prozac for you.
[01:57:34.562 --> 01:57:36.063]  It operates on another level of the brain.
[01:57:37.043 --> 01:57:38.664]  Folks, this is so incredible.
[01:57:39.245 --> 01:57:40.686]  Alright, third hour coming up.
[01:57:40.706 --> 01:57:41.066]  Stay with me.
[01:57:50.198 --> 01:57:50.839]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.499 --> 01:57:52.560]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:54.441]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.021 --> 01:57:55.862]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.603 --> 01:57:57.483]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.503 --> 01:58:02.106]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.346 --> 01:58:06.429]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.289 --> 01:58:20.574]  They're gonna make everyone in the country take a multi-vaccine that blocks cocaine, heroin, and nicotine.
[01:58:20.974 --> 01:58:23.296]  Their excuse is, well, it costs too much money for us to treat it.
[01:58:24.326 --> 01:58:35.209]  And listen, it says, experts at Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, California have developed a super virus, harmless to humans, which produces proteins that can block or reduce the effects of cocaine.
[01:58:35.729 --> 01:58:43.071]  And they give you a virus that goes in and brain damages you, that's what it does, goes in and attacks certain neuroreceptors in your brain.
[01:58:43.532 --> 01:58:48.233]  They're going to inject us with viruses that eat parts of our brain.
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:54.201]  And they got the police in black ski masks, they're building the prisons.
[01:58:54.501 --> 01:58:56.181]  Well, you're insane if you don't take it.
[01:58:56.381 --> 01:58:58.522]  You'll feel much better once you get this injection.
[01:58:58.982 --> 01:59:10.205]  And for decades, we've caught the UN giving women vaccines, a tetanus shot with a hormone added to it, that makes the body attack that hormone so the woman can't ever have a baby.
[01:59:11.125 --> 01:59:15.366]  We've caught them adding it to vaccines that brain damages children, by design.
[01:59:15.426 --> 01:59:19.707]  Not the mercury, a hormone that attacks the cerebral cortex in development.
[01:59:20.276 --> 01:59:22.838]  They're brain-damaging the mass of us to be better slaves.
[01:59:23.138 --> 01:59:25.020]  Folks, you couldn't make this stuff up.
[01:59:25.721 --> 01:59:34.688]  Actually, there's a new movie coming out called Code 63 or 4 with some huge actors where they give you these viruses to control your mind.
[01:59:34.728 --> 01:59:35.629]  It's so good.
[01:59:36.049 --> 01:59:37.210]  Soon you'll be one of us.
[01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:38.631]  Soon you'll take the injection.
[01:59:38.992 --> 01:59:40.813]  I mean, who could come up with stuff like this?
[01:59:41.434 --> 01:59:42.234]  And here it is!
[01:59:42.495 --> 01:59:43.856]  England's gonna make you take it!
[01:59:44.396 --> 01:59:45.617]  And then they're saying, oh, the U.S.
[01:59:45.677 --> 01:59:46.657]  is thinking about doing it.
[01:59:46.977 --> 01:59:48.838]  Oh, you're sorry, your child can't go to school.
[01:59:48.998 --> 01:59:50.899]  Oh, we're going to have CPS take your children.
[01:59:50.939 --> 01:59:57.521]  They won't take the vaccine that has a virus go into the brain and block proteins.
[01:59:57.702 --> 01:59:59.362]  Oh, that's so good for you.
[02:00:00.043 --> 02:00:01.123]  Oh, it's so good.
[02:00:01.423 --> 02:00:03.224]  Ben in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:00:03.284 --> 02:00:03.604]  Welcome.
[02:00:05.445 --> 02:00:06.465]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:07.125 --> 02:00:08.066]  Another little piece of
[02:00:09.062 --> 02:00:10.022]  Media coverage.
[02:00:10.042 --> 02:00:13.263]  Have you heard about the Coca-Cola's new marketing scheme?
[02:00:13.443 --> 02:00:17.604]  Yeah, they got GPS, and when you win, the black helicopters come and bring you in the vehicle.
[02:00:18.424 --> 02:00:20.125]  Yeah, I hadn't heard you mention that.
[02:00:20.165 --> 02:00:22.105]  That's a little creepy.
[02:00:22.265 --> 02:00:28.287]  A couple of years back, I had sent you a Fox News piece where they talk about the black boxes in the cars.
[02:00:28.667 --> 02:00:30.488]  Which track and trace everything you do, yes.
[02:00:30.508 --> 02:00:31.368]  Yeah, you remember that?
[02:00:31.508 --> 02:00:33.228]  Civil Libertarians, get your hearts out.
[02:00:33.248 --> 02:00:34.689]  The kids' safety comes first.
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:38.864]  They're doing a new one on Fox right now.
[02:00:38.924 --> 02:00:47.081]  They're really pushing this RFID tag thing and I just wanted to tell the listeners that it might not be too far off in the future.
[02:00:49.825 --> 02:00:53.629]  They push it and announce that it's coming after it's already in a lot of products.
[02:00:54.150 --> 02:00:55.631]  It's in thousands of products.
[02:00:55.751 --> 02:00:58.694]  It's going to go in all products to replace the barcode.
[02:00:58.714 --> 02:00:59.595]  It's already there.
[02:00:59.936 --> 02:01:09.165]  It's going to be in your passport, your driver's license, in all the products you buy because Walmart and the Defense Department have told their distributors anybody that sells to them has to have this.
[02:01:09.986 --> 02:01:10.807]  Hey, one question.
[02:01:11.367 --> 02:01:19.975]  As far as Code Red goes, do you think they will ever put Code Red... Do you think we'll ever go to Code Red without an actual terror attack?
[02:01:20.796 --> 02:01:23.278]  No, I think we'll go to Code Red after they carry out terror attacks.
[02:01:23.318 --> 02:01:24.019]  Right, right.
[02:01:24.419 --> 02:01:25.160]  Alright, well I'll get off.
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:25.620]  Thanks, man.
[02:01:25.941 --> 02:01:26.361]  Thank you.
[02:01:26.401 --> 02:01:28.483]  And again, they've publicly said it is martial law.
[02:01:29.657 --> 02:01:39.163]  It is martial law, and by the way, we're going to forcibly inoculate you under martial law, and we have vaccines that change your brain chemistry, where you cannot become angry, where you will serve us.
[02:01:39.243 --> 02:01:46.228]  They are openly talking about a vaccine that, where, oh, you're prone to anger, your genetics shows, we're going to give you a shot, no more anger.
[02:01:47.128 --> 02:01:49.090]  Brain damaging you!
[02:01:50.010 --> 02:01:50.891]  They've already been doing it!
[02:01:52.252 --> 02:01:55.314]  You wonder why some people just can't get it, can't, are so, so zombie-like.
[02:01:55.334 --> 02:01:57.275]  Folks, it's been in the vaccines for a long time.
[02:01:58.436 --> 02:01:58.856]  You understand?
[02:02:00.669 --> 02:02:01.429]  You understand, folks?
[02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.690]  You understand?
[02:02:03.090 --> 02:02:05.251]  Folks, this is a nightmare science fiction movie.
[02:02:05.511 --> 02:02:06.311]  You're living in it.
[02:02:07.132 --> 02:02:07.972]  It's really happening.
[02:02:08.152 --> 02:02:12.054]  And I won't be able to talk about this here in Austin on TV soon, because they're going to shut down the TV station.
[02:02:13.854 --> 02:02:15.855]  And they're shutting down talk radio all over the place.
[02:02:16.756 --> 02:02:18.896]  And they're just taking our free speech, and they're going to hurt us in.
[02:02:18.916 --> 02:02:21.597]  They're going to have brainwashed, brain-damaged cops.
[02:02:21.798 --> 02:02:23.338]  It'll come round us up and put us in camps.
[02:02:23.998 --> 02:02:26.359]  And at that point, when they come with their injectors, what do you do?
[02:02:26.419 --> 02:02:27.580]  You've got to stand up against it.
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:30.281]  Sounds nuts, folks, but I just read the London Independent.
[02:02:31.891 --> 02:02:33.454]  Mind control vaccines.
[02:02:33.814 --> 02:02:35.618]  The Manchurian candidate for real.
[02:02:36.279 --> 02:02:37.862]  We're gonna go to Boston when we get back.
[02:02:38.263 --> 02:02:39.265]  Talk to Tom Wallace.
[02:02:39.766 --> 02:02:40.627]  They're on the ground.
[02:02:41.369 --> 02:02:41.789]  Stay with us.
[02:02:47.276 --> 02:02:52.761]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.181 --> 02:02:57.425]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:57.665 --> 02:03:04.692]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.072 --> 02:03:11.178]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:11.338 --> 02:03:12.559]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:12.879 --> 02:03:15.823]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:15.984 --> 02:03:18.006]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:18.307 --> 02:03:25.557]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:25.857 --> 02:03:29.242]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:03:29.662 --> 02:03:34.308]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[02:03:44.582 --> 02:03:48.043]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:48.323 --> 02:03:51.825]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:51.905 --> 02:03:55.866]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:56.086 --> 02:04:02.248]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:02.648 --> 02:04:10.551]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:10.971 --> 02:04:16.314]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[02:04:16.474 --> 02:04:20.235]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:20.616 --> 02:04:22.477]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[02:04:22.517 --> 02:04:24.698]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:04:24.938 --> 02:04:29.860]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:35.463]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:38.864 --> 02:04:41.286]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:41.306 --> 02:04:42.687]  Protect your family.
[02:04:43.227 --> 02:04:44.749]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:44.929 --> 02:04:48.011]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:04:48.151 --> 02:04:52.054]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:04:52.094 --> 02:04:56.337]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:04:56.678 --> 02:05:00.460]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:02.402]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:05:02.982 --> 02:05:05.883]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:05:05.923 --> 02:05:10.625]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:05:10.785 --> 02:05:13.846]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:16.927]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:05:17.367 --> 02:05:23.489]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:05:24.029 --> 02:05:27.812]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:05:28.212 --> 02:05:29.573]  Order your video today.
[02:05:29.914 --> 02:05:30.974]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:05:30.994 --> 02:05:33.516]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[02:05:33.536 --> 02:05:34.777]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[02:05:34.817 --> 02:05:35.077]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.531 --> 02:05:52.612]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.312 --> 02:05:54.413]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.054 --> 02:05:55.895]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.655 --> 02:05:57.516]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.536 --> 02:06:01.999]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:06.523]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.384 --> 02:06:09.205]  Alright, folks.
[02:06:10.966 --> 02:06:14.289]  8 minutes and 27 seconds into this third hour.
[02:06:15.490 --> 02:06:19.333]  To boil it down, I read the federal plans years ago on air.
[02:06:20.971 --> 02:06:37.341]  Under the name of fighting terrorism and for security, and with the hired anarchists they hired to go out and provocateur, and we have this on video, police admitting this, they are going to shut down protests in America, ban protests, and if you insist, they're going to put you in a cage half a mile, a mile away, inside a building.
[02:06:38.801 --> 02:06:48.367]  And in Boston, Mass., there are fences with huge metal girders with protest zones underneath the train station where no one can see you.
[02:06:49.918 --> 02:06:55.520]  They have helicopters, troops with machine guns, heavy machine guns, train on the population, armored vehicles.
[02:06:56.761 --> 02:06:58.081]  This is the new America.
[02:06:58.941 --> 02:07:02.443]  Searching people without warrants, randomly checkpoints all over the city.
[02:07:03.323 --> 02:07:09.986]  And joining us is Tom Wallace with the Boston Committee for Palestinian Rights.
[02:07:11.266 --> 02:07:15.668]  And Mr. Wallace, what is your position with this organization?
[02:07:19.605 --> 02:07:20.466]  Their media work.
[02:07:21.046 --> 02:07:22.847]  So you're running the website?
[02:07:23.668 --> 02:07:25.049]  Well, not necessarily running the website.
[02:07:25.069 --> 02:07:28.091]  The website is just pretty basic.
[02:07:28.872 --> 02:07:31.534]  Is that CPR4Democracy.com?
[02:07:32.554 --> 02:07:34.976]  No, this is BCPR.org.
[02:07:36.017 --> 02:07:40.160]  Alright, because some of the photos of the cages and stuff are at CPR4Democracy.com.
[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:42.622]  Right, those are the ones I forwarded to you earlier.
[02:07:43.002 --> 02:07:45.884]  That came from someplace else and I forwarded them
[02:07:46.878 --> 02:07:50.221]  Okay, well those are on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:07:50.822 --> 02:07:55.185]  Can you describe the atmosphere right now in Boston?
[02:07:57.327 --> 02:07:59.689]  I think that you did a pretty good job of it, actually.
[02:08:00.670 --> 02:08:04.634]  As I was driving around the city last night, there are basically police on every corner.
[02:08:05.254 --> 02:08:10.479]  The MBTA police, as you have pointed out, are randomly searching people on the T.
[02:08:12.173 --> 02:08:15.074]  There are cameras on many buildings.
[02:08:15.114 --> 02:08:24.978]  You don't even know how many, but several news stations this morning were doing programs on the security, and basically there are just cameras everywhere.
[02:08:25.338 --> 02:08:27.939]  And of course, those are going to stay there after the convention.
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:29.780]  Absolutely.
[02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:32.521]  They didn't spend millions of dollars to put them up just to take them down.
[02:08:33.182 --> 02:08:41.305]  They provide them with all kinds of new tools that, you know, no one ever dreamed that they would have
[02:08:41.894 --> 02:08:43.055]  This kind of capability.
[02:08:44.195 --> 02:08:47.898]  So, I mean, it's really, everybody is just stunned by it.
[02:08:47.958 --> 02:08:56.563]  I heard an interview with former Governor Michael Dukakis last night, who was also the former Democratic nominee, I think 1988.
[02:08:57.183 --> 02:09:03.227]  And he just, he was basically calling all of this absolute insanity.
[02:09:04.628 --> 02:09:08.110]  It really is insane, what this looks like.
[02:09:08.530 --> 02:09:11.612]  But the protest pen that you're talking about,
[02:09:12.105 --> 02:09:24.095]  What had been worked out with the city ahead of time, and basically what they wanted to do was provide a free protest area that would have access to the delegates.
[02:09:24.636 --> 02:09:27.017]  So the delegates could see you, and you could see the delegates.
[02:09:27.378 --> 02:09:28.979]  They could hear you.
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:33.223]  And it would actually make a safe environment for everyone.
[02:09:34.181 --> 02:09:39.344]  The limitations following 9-11, it seems like a reasonable thing to do, so everyone kind of went, well, okay.
[02:09:39.384 --> 02:09:50.551]  Oh yeah, because protesters are evil, Al-Qaeda and... Well, yeah, as if someone is going to impose, as if someone is going to pose as a protester, if they're going to do something.
[02:09:50.611 --> 02:09:52.232]  That seems insane to me.
[02:09:52.252 --> 02:09:56.434]  Well, we're all guilty until proven innocent, and we really know who's behind 9-11.
[02:09:56.514 --> 02:10:02.238]  But the point here is, now you guys are going to be walled off in these cages, and... Right.
[02:10:03.069 --> 02:10:17.540]  So they're built, what they've turned these into are, what you can't see, if you have to look really closely at the photograph, to notice that on top of the, so you have the jersey barricade at the bottom, with a fence on top of that, and then the razor wire that is up overhead.
[02:10:18.041 --> 02:10:30.691]  And then there's this netting, and you have to look closely at the photograph to see it, you're actually, there's a net overhead, that covers from the girder down to that fence, so that you are completely netted in.
[02:10:31.091 --> 02:10:31.972]  And it really is,
[02:10:33.027 --> 02:10:33.427]  A cage.
[02:10:34.469 --> 02:10:44.258]  Now, by the way, all over the country from Portland to you name it, they block off certain streets, then the police won't let people evacuate and attack the peaceful protesters.
[02:10:44.538 --> 02:10:45.659]  Were you familiar with that, sir?
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:50.264]  No, but I think that a lot of people are afraid to go into this tent for that reason.
[02:10:52.461 --> 02:10:55.623]  Yeah, we're going to put you in the snow way out, no way in.
[02:10:55.643 --> 02:10:58.284]  We're going to lock you up in a huge cage with razor wire.
[02:10:58.844 --> 02:11:03.827]  Now, the federal judge says it's going to stay, but he also admits and calls it an internment camp.
[02:11:04.347 --> 02:11:04.807]  Exactly.
[02:11:04.907 --> 02:11:08.149]  I think his original quote said, well, we won't go there.
[02:11:08.569 --> 02:11:09.950]  He calls it an internment camp.
[02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:11.730]  And because that's what it looks like.
[02:11:12.291 --> 02:11:14.772]  I mean, we're calling it Gulag, Palestine.
[02:11:17.219 --> 02:11:19.500]  Because it also just looks like that.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:23.621]  The only reason, I think most groups, there's no one else going into that town except us.
[02:11:23.781 --> 02:11:35.725]  The only reason that we're going in is because the US, I mean the city, couldn't have provided a better platform for a protest against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
[02:11:36.145 --> 02:11:43.748]  Because this is what they're doing in the West Bank and Gaza, is they're building these cages, they're turning Palestinian villages and towns into cages.
[02:11:44.215 --> 02:11:45.175]  So, and to prison.
[02:11:45.315 --> 02:11:47.136]  So, it's a personal step for us.
[02:11:47.156 --> 02:11:50.657]  Well, really, kind of like the Nazis did with Jewish ghettos.
[02:11:51.477 --> 02:11:55.498]  Well, I do refer to it as ghettos, absolutely.
[02:11:55.578 --> 02:11:58.599]  They are ghettos.
[02:11:59.099 --> 02:12:10.642]  In the city of Kalkylia, of 40,000 people, there's only one way in and out, and that city is controlled by a gate that Israeli soldiers control, and if they feel like
[02:12:11.112 --> 02:12:15.136]  Letting anyone in or out of the entire city, they do, and if they don't, they don't.
[02:12:15.416 --> 02:12:16.477]  But isn't that freedom?
[02:12:16.497 --> 02:12:20.020]  I mean, we're going to have that here if they admit.
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:31.090]  I have New Jersey newspapers, UPI, saying that Israel's going to be allowed to kill Americans whenever they want, no judge, no jury, and that they're advising cities how to set things up like this.
[02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:32.391]  I mean, isn't that going to be good?
[02:12:33.075 --> 02:12:37.137]  Well, Israel has killed an American, as they felt like it.
[02:12:37.197 --> 02:12:38.258]  Her name was Rachel Corey.
[02:12:38.398 --> 02:12:40.839]  Yeah, running over with a bulldozer and laughing about it.
[02:12:40.879 --> 02:12:41.860]  Exactly.
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:46.722]  And, you know, she's not the first.
[02:12:46.762 --> 02:12:48.023]  She's not going to be the last.
[02:12:48.143 --> 02:12:58.028]  But, have we... Yeah, I guess that's what... We're taking lessons from the Israelis in Iraq, so I guess we're going to start taking lessons
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:03.202]  Have you seen the new Amir Graeb photos where they've got Israeli tattoos, the torturers?
[02:13:03.703 --> 02:13:05.864]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:13:05.924 --> 02:13:07.425]  It didn't shock or surprise me.
[02:13:07.725 --> 02:13:09.586]  I think that shocked and surprised other people.
[02:13:10.006 --> 02:13:12.027]  But I wasn't particularly surprised by it.
[02:13:12.387 --> 02:13:22.893]  And slowly but surely, people are starting to admit that, you know, the Israeli pressure was behind a lot of the invasion of Iraq.
[02:13:23.013 --> 02:13:24.794]  Look, who benefited from that?
[02:13:25.977 --> 02:13:29.659]  Well, the oil companies and the weapons dealers, but also Israel, they're a part of it.
[02:13:29.679 --> 02:13:34.961]  And of course, we have to mention that about half the people in Israel are against all this.
[02:13:35.721 --> 02:13:40.303]  And they get arrested, they get tortured, they've been enslaved by this.
[02:13:42.024 --> 02:13:46.226]  Arab states use Israel as kind of the scapegoat for their own abuse.
[02:13:46.786 --> 02:13:48.386]  I mean, the whole thing's a bad situation.
[02:13:50.287 --> 02:13:51.948]  And we contribute to that as well.
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:59.702]  I mean, we don't... Saddam Hussein wasn't a problem until, you know, we decided that he was.
[02:13:59.782 --> 02:14:04.983]  I mean, who provided him with all the weapons that he's supposedly... Our listeners know that.
[02:14:05.023 --> 02:14:10.904]  They know that he was a CIA officer and that they set him up just like Noriega and everybody else, but just like Bin Laden.
[02:14:10.944 --> 02:14:13.105]  But going back here to Boston... Uh-huh.
[02:14:13.712 --> 02:14:29.465]  We have photos on the website, Associated Press photos, of troops with heavy 50 Cal and 7.62 M60s up on top buildings pointing loaded machine guns at the population.
[02:14:29.745 --> 02:14:30.466]  Have you seen that?
[02:14:31.026 --> 02:14:31.306]  Yeah!
[02:14:31.947 --> 02:14:34.889]  If you just go downtown, you can see them everywhere.
[02:14:35.069 --> 02:14:37.772]  You know, I should have gone to this.
[02:14:38.112 --> 02:14:40.674]  You should hop on a plane and come up.
[02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:43.010]  It's extraordinary, but you know what?
[02:14:43.331 --> 02:14:47.533]  Having missed this, if you think that this is any, what do you see in New York?
[02:14:50.836 --> 02:14:52.577]  Yeah, I hear New York's gonna be even worse.
[02:14:53.297 --> 02:14:58.801]  I would, it, probably, so, you know, you should, you should do a live show from New York, for sure.
[02:15:01.122 --> 02:15:07.186]  Well, this is just blowing me away right now, and, uh, but, but, you know, I'm laughing, but it's not funny.
[02:15:09.008 --> 02:15:10.208]  You know, it's really not.
[02:15:11.733 --> 02:15:12.533]  It's really pathetic.
[02:15:12.593 --> 02:15:16.795]  It's really... This has nothing to do with keeping us safe from terrorism?
[02:15:17.555 --> 02:15:17.715]  No.
[02:15:18.195 --> 02:15:21.396]  And then you look at who's behind the terrorism and it sure isn't the people they're claiming.
[02:15:21.856 --> 02:15:26.318]  I'll tell you what, give us the website for the organization and some other websites we should check out, Tom.
[02:15:27.798 --> 02:15:32.119]  Check out bcpr.org.
[02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:35.360]  That's the website for BCPR.
[02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:40.142]  Can I stay in contact with you and can I get video of stuff you shoot for my local TV show?
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:53.405]  Yeah, I have some great video, actually, from a protest in Azalea, which is basically all Palestinian civilians and some internationals protesting against the wall being built through their village.
[02:15:53.705 --> 02:15:55.225]  I'll even pay you to ship me the footage.
[02:15:55.245 --> 02:15:56.306]  I want to show it to people.
[02:15:56.766 --> 02:15:57.726]  It's amazing.
[02:15:58.947 --> 02:16:09.171]  But get this, I mean, the tear gas that they're using, you can see the soldiers, the woman that filmed this is incredible, and she's with IWPS.
[02:16:10.023 --> 02:16:12.425]  And they're just, like, firing this tear gas.
[02:16:12.445 --> 02:16:13.806]  But the tear gas is different.
[02:16:14.106 --> 02:16:16.647]  It doesn't just burn your eyes and your throat.
[02:16:16.728 --> 02:16:17.928]  It actually knocks you out.
[02:16:18.028 --> 02:16:20.170]  So, some people were out for 24 hours.
[02:16:20.230 --> 02:16:22.872]  Some people who have been out were out for days.
[02:16:23.412 --> 02:16:26.954]  And they're basically using chemical weapons against these people.
[02:16:29.336 --> 02:16:30.437]  Unbelievable.
[02:16:30.517 --> 02:16:32.798]  Well, Tom... I can send you the footage, for sure.
[02:16:33.799 --> 02:16:37.001]  Tom, we're going to get Jeannie
[02:16:39.804 --> 02:16:42.766]  Crescenzo on the show coming up here in a few minutes.
[02:16:42.786 --> 02:16:44.546]  Do you want to stay on with her, or do you need to go?
[02:16:45.227 --> 02:16:49.429]  No, I actually need to go, but I would love to talk to you again.
[02:16:49.689 --> 02:16:50.990]  Yeah, give us those websites again.
[02:16:51.990 --> 02:17:08.739]  You can check bcpr.org, lsolidarity.org, any of the ACLU you could check, or US Campaign Against Deoccupation.
[02:17:09.941 --> 02:17:13.082]  Okay, and can I get you back on later this week as this develops?
[02:17:13.682 --> 02:17:13.902]  Sure.
[02:17:14.202 --> 02:17:16.322]  I'll perhaps even get you on the phone from the street?
[02:17:17.563 --> 02:17:19.403]  Yeah, I did that a lot in the West Bank.
[02:17:19.463 --> 02:17:20.303]  I'd be happy to do it for you.
[02:17:20.883 --> 02:17:26.344]  Okay, well we really appreciate you, Tom Wallace, coming on and your courage to be in the middle of all this and be careful, okay?
[02:17:26.764 --> 02:17:27.425]  Sure, thank you.
[02:17:27.685 --> 02:17:28.405]  Take care, my friend.
[02:17:29.485 --> 02:17:33.906]  Wow, I mean in the middle of all this, machine guns aimed at them in cages.
[02:17:34.901 --> 02:17:39.651]  Martial law folks training the country who's watching this how to be good little slaves.
[02:17:39.752 --> 02:17:41.315]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:17:41.956 --> 02:17:43.720]  We'll talk to another one of these folks when we get back.
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:44.101]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.037 --> 02:17:46.658]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:17:46.778 --> 02:17:50.881]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:17:51.021 --> 02:17:53.903]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:17:53.983 --> 02:18:00.708]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:18:00.888 --> 02:18:03.891]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:18:04.091 --> 02:18:06.492]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:06.613 --> 02:18:11.336]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:18:11.516 --> 02:18:26.085]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrate, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:18:26.245 --> 02:18:32.949]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today, and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96, or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[02:18:44.339 --> 02:18:45.881]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:18:46.041 --> 02:18:47.182]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:18:47.343 --> 02:18:50.766]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:18:50.866 --> 02:18:51.327]  Phenol!
[02:18:51.607 --> 02:18:58.695]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:18:59.195 --> 02:19:03.118]  ETA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:19:03.218 --> 02:19:03.678]  Fragrance?
[02:19:04.039 --> 02:19:08.822]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:19:08.942 --> 02:19:13.646]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:19:13.866 --> 02:19:16.428]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[02:19:16.688 --> 02:19:20.090]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:23.733]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:19:23.973 --> 02:19:26.355]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:19:26.495 --> 02:19:27.375]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:19:45.987 --> 02:19:47.769]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[02:19:48.269 --> 02:19:51.691]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:19:52.191 --> 02:19:52.832]  Let's update.
[02:19:53.348 --> 02:19:58.110]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:19:58.730 --> 02:20:01.191]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:20:01.871 --> 02:20:02.811]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:20:02.851 --> 02:20:05.152]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[02:20:05.692 --> 02:20:06.592]  Today, the U.S.
[02:20:06.612 --> 02:20:08.833]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[02:20:09.253 --> 02:20:10.774]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:20:11.334 --> 02:20:13.335]  January of 2002, the gold spot was 283.
[02:20:14.675 --> 02:20:16.936]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:20:20.526 --> 02:20:22.708]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[02:20:23.089 --> 02:20:25.752]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:20:26.292 --> 02:20:27.674]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:20:28.114 --> 02:20:29.816]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:20:30.237 --> 02:20:32.199]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:20:32.619 --> 02:20:34.742]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:20:36.904 --> 02:20:39.047]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[02:20:39.427 --> 02:20:39.727]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:44.591 --> 02:20:47.853]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[02:20:48.193 --> 02:20:52.855]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[02:20:53.055 --> 02:20:54.576]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[02:20:54.776 --> 02:20:57.197]  We've discovered it's just better to use Paws.
[02:20:57.417 --> 02:21:04.180]  Pet Accident Wash-Up Solution, or PAWS, is the quickest and safest pet stain and odor eliminator known to man, or man's best friend.
[02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:07.642]  PAWS is safe on any material, even directly on your pet's bedding.
[02:21:07.902 --> 02:21:10.323]  PAWS will work on the toughest stains and odors in your home.
[02:21:10.643 --> 02:21:13.343]  It's guaranteed to lift stains that have been set in for years.
[02:21:13.543 --> 02:21:15.744]  Proving again, it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:21:16.104 --> 02:21:19.384]  It's only a matter of time until Fido or Fluffy has an accident.
[02:21:19.644 --> 02:21:20.825]  Be prepared with PAWS.
[02:21:21.125 --> 02:21:25.086]  Use PAWS anywhere stains and odors are a problem, like the laundry or the bathroom.
[02:21:25.326 --> 02:21:28.826]  Try PAWS once and you'll quickly discover it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:21:29.086 --> 02:21:30.667]  Call 1-877-289-PAWS or visit GetPAWS.com.
[02:21:30.827 --> 02:21:32.327]  That's www.getpaws.com.
[02:21:37.308 --> 02:21:39.130]  Alright folks, Jeanne Crescenzo is our guest.
[02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:40.911]  She's the editor of CPR4Democracy.com.
[02:21:41.111 --> 02:21:42.412]  We have a link to it at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:04.323 --> 02:22:09.476]  And they are literally locked up in cages, no protests allowed where the public can see it.
[02:22:09.816 --> 02:22:13.024]  They have them under the train station with barbed wire and nets over them.
[02:22:13.943 --> 02:22:21.826]  She was at Miami, where they admittedly marched judges and union heads down alleys and beat them savagely.
[02:22:22.126 --> 02:22:28.129]  She said it's not as bad there in Boston yet, where they openly attack peaceful people.
[02:22:28.969 --> 02:22:32.590]  But they've got machine guns trained on them, armored vehicles, helicopters.
[02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:34.491]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:22:34.771 --> 02:22:36.472]  This is about training you how to be a slave.
[02:22:36.832 --> 02:22:38.433]  And I talked to her during the break and she said,
[02:22:39.313 --> 02:22:41.194]  Our freedoms are basically dead right now.
[02:22:41.574 --> 02:22:43.034]  This is martial law, folks.
[02:22:43.635 --> 02:22:46.656]  Jeannie, it's great to have you on with us, and thanks for joining us.
[02:22:47.176 --> 02:22:47.956]  You've got the floor.
[02:22:48.016 --> 02:22:48.736]  What's going on?
[02:22:49.296 --> 02:22:52.057]  Well, people are not buying into it.
[02:22:53.418 --> 02:22:56.239]  They've built this cage that's like a concentration camp.
[02:22:57.499 --> 02:22:58.820]  But we're not going there.
[02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:04.882]  Yesterday, there was a rally and march from the Boston Commons.
[02:23:05.002 --> 02:23:07.743]  There was, by my estimate, between 4,000 and 5,000 people.
[02:23:09.028 --> 02:23:10.228]  They gathered in the Commons.
[02:23:10.428 --> 02:23:11.309]  It was peaceful.
[02:23:11.869 --> 02:23:13.509]  It was sponsored by ANSWER.
[02:23:13.529 --> 02:23:22.272]  There were many organizations that had tables set up and people were passing around their pamphlets and it was really what democracy is all about.
[02:23:23.132 --> 02:23:26.273]  Then we all organized into a parade and marched.
[02:23:26.634 --> 02:23:32.735]  It was about a four mile march down to the Fleet Center where the convention is and back again to the park.
[02:23:33.936 --> 02:23:37.497]  While we were on the way, there was police all along the side.
[02:23:37.967 --> 02:23:44.849]  But it was nothing compared to the terrorizing presence of police that I witnessed in Miami.
[02:23:46.229 --> 02:23:51.651]  I have to admit that it was intimidating, but controlled.
[02:23:52.311 --> 02:23:55.612]  Now they are wearing the black ski masks, the black uniforms.
[02:23:55.632 --> 02:23:56.272]  Not all of them.
[02:23:56.412 --> 02:23:57.072]  There were some.
[02:23:57.572 --> 02:23:59.933]  Not ski masks.
[02:24:00.173 --> 02:24:01.653]  The shield in front of their face.
[02:24:01.673 --> 02:24:02.654]  There were some that were
[02:24:04.271 --> 02:24:06.292]  Dressed like they were in Miami.
[02:24:06.392 --> 02:24:09.114]  Well, I do have photos of them in Ski Mask, too.
[02:24:09.154 --> 02:24:10.015]  You may not have seen those.
[02:24:10.075 --> 02:24:10.955]  I didn't see those.
[02:24:10.975 --> 02:24:15.618]  What about the AP photos of men with huge machine guns aiming at the public?
[02:24:15.958 --> 02:24:17.139]  Well, they may have been there.
[02:24:17.319 --> 02:24:18.260]  I didn't see that.
[02:24:20.901 --> 02:24:26.765]  We were marching through narrow streets and I don't know what was up on buildings and things.
[02:24:26.785 --> 02:24:28.586]  There was some police on horses.
[02:24:31.047 --> 02:24:31.828]  It was not
[02:24:32.672 --> 02:24:35.534]  I have to say that again, it wasn't as bad as Miami.
[02:24:35.994 --> 02:24:39.596]  It did feel like, you know, who's protecting who here?
[02:24:40.056 --> 02:24:46.499]  Because if they're supposed to be there to protect us from terrorists, what were they doing?
[02:24:46.519 --> 02:24:52.442]  This is all too convenient, that we're going to get rid of America's freedoms here in our constitutional republic.
[02:24:54.138 --> 02:24:58.460]  In the name of defending the country's liberties and freedoms.
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:24:59.720]  Now, you were in Miami.
[02:25:00.281 --> 02:25:03.442]  For those that aren't aware of what happened last year, can you break that down for them?
[02:25:04.802 --> 02:25:06.883]  We couldn't even get to the protest site.
[02:25:06.943 --> 02:25:13.685]  Now, you're talking about protesters who were retired people, grandmothers and grandfathers, union people.
[02:25:13.745 --> 02:25:15.706]  These were not wacko jobs.
[02:25:15.906 --> 02:25:21.248]  These were ordinary American citizens who wanted to protest against
[02:25:22.007 --> 02:25:27.089]  It seems to be an escalating system of taking our jobs away.
[02:25:27.430 --> 02:25:34.193]  Well, I interviewed 85-year-old veterans who were taken down alleys to be beaten and told you shouldn't protest.
[02:25:36.273 --> 02:25:37.994]  I'm not denying that that happened.
[02:25:38.074 --> 02:25:39.615]  I did witness that.
[02:25:39.775 --> 02:25:40.855]  So what happened in Miami?
[02:25:40.875 --> 02:25:42.536]  You said you couldn't get to the protest.
[02:25:42.576 --> 02:25:44.517]  No, they made it impossible.
[02:25:44.537 --> 02:25:45.277]  We ended up
[02:25:46.997 --> 02:25:48.097]  We got on a bus.
[02:25:48.157 --> 02:25:55.340]  We parked our car far far away, got on a bus that was supposed to take us down to the area.
[02:25:55.681 --> 02:26:06.305]  And then about 6 or 7 blocks away, the bus driver tells us, and the bus is all full of protesters, says, I've been ordered to turn around.
[02:26:06.325 --> 02:26:08.346]  He wouldn't even let us off there.
[02:26:08.626 --> 02:26:09.166]  So we took him.
[02:26:09.586 --> 02:26:11.527]  But it turned out he was a transit authority cop.
[02:26:12.168 --> 02:26:15.991]  And they were union people, and they were sympathetic to the cause.
[02:26:16.011 --> 02:26:22.855]  So he took us to the metro station and told us exactly how to get there that way, which we did.
[02:26:24.516 --> 02:26:31.281]  But there were a lot of people that didn't get down to the protest site, just because they just made it impossible there.
[02:26:31.721 --> 02:26:34.143]  When I arrived, I thought I was in another country.
[02:26:34.703 --> 02:26:39.006]  There were four deep of police in riot gear.
[02:26:39.875 --> 02:26:43.497]  Holding all kinds of interesting weapons that I never saw before.
[02:26:44.477 --> 02:26:50.281]  Brand new things that were bought with the money that was put aside for homeland security in the Iraq War.
[02:26:50.401 --> 02:26:55.523]  Part of the $87 million that was put aside for protection.
[02:26:55.843 --> 02:26:56.864]  Well, that's part of the war.
[02:26:56.904 --> 02:26:57.785]  War against the people.
[02:26:57.845 --> 02:26:58.985]  That's war against the people.
[02:26:59.706 --> 02:27:04.288]  So, I was afraid that I was going to see that kind of presence here in Boston.
[02:27:05.177 --> 02:27:13.802]  What I did the other night, I was down at the Boston Social Forum, and I'm reporting on what's going on, because God knows you're not seeing it in the press.
[02:27:14.242 --> 02:27:16.443]  In fact, this morning it was the New York Times.
[02:27:16.463 --> 02:27:17.383]  Well, I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:27:17.403 --> 02:27:19.665]  I want to hear what we're not hearing from the New York Times.
[02:27:19.725 --> 02:27:25.188]  I want to hear about the difference between Boston and Miami, but I do want to get into what happened in Miami, too.
[02:27:25.208 --> 02:27:25.928]  That's important.
[02:27:26.568 --> 02:27:28.449]  And we'll be right back with our guest.
[02:27:29.090 --> 02:27:29.690]  Stay with us.
[02:27:30.090 --> 02:27:32.872]  I'm Alex Jones, and the website's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:35.111 --> 02:27:38.115]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.036 --> 02:27:41.719]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.985 --> 02:27:46.986]  It's finally here!
[02:27:47.126 --> 02:27:48.086]  Spring has arrived!
[02:27:48.286 --> 02:27:51.248]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:27:51.468 --> 02:27:54.930]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:27:55.150 --> 02:28:03.294]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[02:28:12.799 --> 02:28:17.301]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.

[02:29:45.359 --> 02:29:47.040]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:29:47.140 --> 02:29:49.622]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[02:29:49.822 --> 02:29:50.503]  It feels great.
[02:29:50.703 --> 02:29:51.744]  Absolutely wonderful.
[02:29:51.824 --> 02:29:57.348]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:29:57.668 --> 02:29:59.190]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[02:29:59.450 --> 02:30:01.812]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[02:30:01.972 --> 02:30:05.054]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[02:30:05.182 --> 02:30:05.923]  That's incredible!
[02:30:06.123 --> 02:30:06.944]  Well that's for sure.
[02:30:06.964 --> 02:30:07.325]  Was it easy?
[02:30:20.162 --> 02:30:20.743]  We're good to go!
[02:31:02.828 --> 02:31:10.191]  All right, my friends, we're talking to Jeanne Crescenzo, editor of CPRforDemocracy.com.
[02:31:11.491 --> 02:31:22.115]  They have photos of these cages where they lock people up in these cages where the public can't even see you a half mile from the convention center, behind even other larger fences.
[02:31:23.533 --> 02:31:41.040]  We're going to have her on for about five more minutes, ten more minutes, then we'll go to Dan and Joshua and others that are holding, and a bunch of others just out of control, New World Order, fascistic, communistic, whatever you want to call it, total tyranny, globally, run by the military-industrial complex.
[02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:48.403]  But, I've been talking to Jeannie during the breaks, I mean, she was in Miami, she was at the Marshall Law there in Georgia,
[02:31:49.313 --> 02:31:51.735]  But now she's in Boston right now, folks.
[02:31:51.775 --> 02:31:53.035]  Our people there on the ground.
[02:31:53.055 --> 02:31:58.679]  We're going to have lots of these folks on throughout the week of the Democratic National Convention, also with the situation in New York.
[02:31:58.739 --> 02:32:08.165]  But during the break, we had left off with the media not telling us, even the so-called liberal media, not telling us what's really going on.
[02:32:08.205 --> 02:32:08.865]  Tell us about that.
[02:32:09.505 --> 02:32:13.608]  Well, the New York Times says that, you know, the Democratic Party is this great unified front.
[02:32:14.328 --> 02:32:16.890]  And they don't mention anything
[02:32:17.833 --> 02:32:20.235]  That's happening here outside of the convention.
[02:32:20.575 --> 02:32:27.500]  They didn't mention a word about this rally in March with 5,000 people yesterday.
[02:32:28.001 --> 02:32:38.648]  They didn't mention the Boston Social Forum with thousands and thousands of people came and participated in over 600 different types of events over the weekend.
[02:32:39.769 --> 02:32:42.491]  I just came from a forum at St.
[02:32:42.511 --> 02:32:44.673]  Paul's Church here right off the Boston Commons.
[02:32:45.758 --> 02:32:52.606]  The church is packed and we have speakers like Jesse Jackson and Dennis Kucinich talking about civil rights.
[02:32:54.408 --> 02:32:56.890]  And it's not being picked up by the media.
[02:32:57.111 --> 02:33:05.280]  Not only that, according to what I read in the front page of the New York Times today, the Democratic Party is trying to tell us now to lighten up on Bush.
[02:33:06.934 --> 02:33:10.796]  Well, yeah, the skull and bones staged election with the two cousins.
[02:33:11.396 --> 02:33:15.799]  And again, folks, whether you love the Democratic Party or hate it, you should be able to see the other side.
[02:33:15.859 --> 02:33:18.680]  Even the conservatives that are protesting aren't going to get much attention.
[02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:35.789]  And this is a staged event, right out in everybody's face, and we should know what the protesters are saying and doing, but by shutting this down, by having these zones, they're able to ignore that because they don't want the average Democrat knowing that Terry says he's for this war.
[02:33:36.409 --> 02:33:42.813]  If we were to protest in that cage, and let's make it clear, it's not like anybody's being forced into that cage.
[02:33:42.893 --> 02:33:48.216]  What the demonstrators have decided, and the progressive groups here, is that we will not
[02:33:48.584 --> 02:33:50.305]  We will go anywhere but there.
[02:33:50.665 --> 02:33:51.866]  We are not going in there.
[02:33:51.886 --> 02:33:53.767]  But they're saying that that's your designated area.
[02:33:53.787 --> 02:33:54.407]  What are they going to do?
[02:33:55.308 --> 02:33:56.468]  We're just not going there.
[02:33:56.948 --> 02:33:59.890]  We're protesting the cage by not using the cage.
[02:33:59.950 --> 02:34:01.271]  Okay, I've got to stop you right there.
[02:34:01.591 --> 02:34:11.916]  You mentioned that everybody was there, the protest was over in Miami, sitting in the park, and then suddenly some provocateurs did something, and you said definitely provocateurs.
[02:34:11.996 --> 02:34:15.598]  I have video in Seattle of hired provocateurs, police admitting it.
[02:34:15.818 --> 02:34:16.979]  Can you describe what happened there?
[02:34:17.583 --> 02:34:23.110]  Well, there were people who were marching in alongside us that were dressed like anarchists.
[02:34:23.170 --> 02:34:27.736]  You know, they had the all black and the black ski masks on.
[02:34:28.718 --> 02:34:35.927]  But they were so out of it compared to 99% of the people there were just regular folks.
[02:34:36.570 --> 02:34:38.732]  That we're protesting the FDA.
[02:34:38.853 --> 02:34:40.655]  And then they always create the problem.
[02:34:40.675 --> 02:34:43.037]  And then the cops, I've seen it on video, don't go after them.
[02:34:43.358 --> 02:34:45.060]  They'll run right past them.
[02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:50.205]  And here in Austin, at the Fortune 500 meeting four years ago, I have video of this, folks.
[02:34:50.225 --> 02:34:51.227]  We put it on local TV.
[02:34:52.085 --> 02:34:53.826]  There's about 500 protesters.
[02:34:53.986 --> 02:34:58.468]  We're there at the Capitol to march to the Four Seasons Hotel, about eight blocks away.
[02:34:59.088 --> 02:35:04.491]  And these two huge thugs with arms the size of tree trunks, in ski masks, are trying to start fights.
[02:35:04.611 --> 02:35:05.291]  I go, media!
[02:35:05.531 --> 02:35:06.091]  It's cops!
[02:35:06.111 --> 02:35:07.192]  They're trying to revocateur!
[02:35:07.732 --> 02:35:10.893]  And 50 cops run across the street and go, back off, Jones!
[02:35:10.913 --> 02:35:17.516]  Well, you know, the thing was, the media arrived with protective gear in Miami.
[02:35:18.637 --> 02:35:20.518]  This is before, you know, we even started to march.
[02:35:21.417 --> 02:35:30.184]  Being a journalist myself, I went up to these guys, you know, photographers and journalists, and, you know, what are you guys all wearing this armor for?
[02:35:30.544 --> 02:35:32.826]  And they were like, oh, we've got to talk to you.
[02:35:33.367 --> 02:35:34.688]  So they knew ahead of time.
[02:35:35.088 --> 02:35:42.434]  And I saw at the G8 Summit, where it was, you know, there was gazillions of dollars spent on security.
[02:35:42.514 --> 02:35:45.116]  Most of it was to intimidate people not to show up.
[02:35:45.612 --> 02:35:46.892]  So there weren't that many people.
[02:35:46.932 --> 02:35:50.074]  But we went and did a protest at the Hercules chemical plant.
[02:35:51.354 --> 02:35:58.436]  Brunswick, Georgia, the pollution is so bad that the grammar school there has no windows.
[02:35:59.317 --> 02:36:01.637]  And so that's where we had started this demonstration.
[02:36:01.677 --> 02:36:03.938]  And we walked down to the Hercules plant.
[02:36:03.978 --> 02:36:10.460]  And across the street was the bridge to go over to Pine Island, where they were holding the summit.
[02:36:11.161 --> 02:36:13.661]  And it was just too much of a temptation for the people.
[02:36:13.681 --> 02:36:15.182]  They wanted to cross that bridge.
[02:36:15.871 --> 02:36:21.535]  And fortunately, it was local police, and I have to give credit to the police chief of Brunswick.
[02:36:22.035 --> 02:36:24.276]  He was at a lot of these events.
[02:36:24.576 --> 02:36:27.198]  He made himself available, and he was a human being.
[02:36:27.918 --> 02:36:36.403]  And when this confrontation started, you could see that they were going to try to get over that bridge.
[02:36:38.325 --> 02:36:41.607]  Only about a dozen armored police showed up.
[02:36:41.787 --> 02:36:43.888]  So it wasn't this huge show force like Miami.
[02:36:44.492 --> 02:36:47.653]  And there was a kind of lined up face-to-face people yelling.
[02:36:47.993 --> 02:36:50.514]  Well, the people were yelling and the police were just standing there.
[02:36:51.094 --> 02:36:53.235]  And there was no attack on people.
[02:36:53.275 --> 02:36:54.196]  There were no arrests.
[02:36:54.256 --> 02:36:57.217]  They just let people voice it, what they were trying to say.
[02:36:57.497 --> 02:36:58.997]  And that's what protests should be about.
[02:36:59.077 --> 02:37:03.959]  Okay, let's let the police keep us from doing what we're not supposed to do.
[02:37:03.979 --> 02:37:08.841]  You know, whether it's causing, you know, they have people that they have to protect.
[02:37:08.901 --> 02:37:09.501]  I understand that.
[02:37:09.841 --> 02:37:11.002]  But it was handled right.
[02:37:11.382 --> 02:37:11.982]  In the end,
[02:37:12.577 --> 02:37:15.882]  The police chief negotiated an agreement where everybody could win.
[02:37:16.202 --> 02:37:18.366]  He let the people, the protesters...
[02:37:19.102 --> 02:37:23.263]  Go across the street, march across the street, and march around the intersection and come back.
[02:37:23.303 --> 02:37:26.464]  And of course they did it in little tiny baby steps that drove everybody nuts.
[02:37:26.764 --> 02:37:28.764]  But again, we're having the chilling effect.
[02:37:28.825 --> 02:37:38.207]  You said that instead of, whereas years ago tens of thousands would show up, you said 300 showed up because they declared much of Georgia an emergency preemptive zone.
[02:37:38.467 --> 02:37:42.428]  And everybody was, not only that, they said that there was going to be a terrorist strike.
[02:37:42.768 --> 02:37:45.149]  And now they're saying the same thing about here in Boston.
[02:37:45.249 --> 02:37:46.669]  Oh, there's going to be a terrorist attack.
[02:37:46.729 --> 02:37:53.452]  And they tell the media that to bind them psychologically to the... No, they're telling the people that because they don't want people to know.
[02:37:53.472 --> 02:37:56.433]  But they're also telling the media, you're the target, you know, stay with us.
[02:37:56.853 --> 02:37:57.113]  Right.
[02:37:57.833 --> 02:38:00.714]  Stay with us behind the fences in the hard zone.
[02:38:00.754 --> 02:38:02.055]  Don't go out with the protesters.
[02:38:02.415 --> 02:38:02.655]  Right.
[02:38:02.995 --> 02:38:07.516]  Now this cage that they have set up is totally invisible to the public.
[02:38:08.657 --> 02:38:12.278]  If we were to stage a protest in there, it would be a total waste of time.
[02:38:12.907 --> 02:38:15.848]  Let alone the fact that if that was a building, it would be condemned.
[02:38:16.008 --> 02:38:19.509]  And a federal judge has now called it an internment camp.
[02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:21.030]  Absolutely.
[02:38:21.170 --> 02:38:23.710]  But then he goes on to say, but it's going to stand.
[02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:25.631]  What's the excuse for that?
[02:38:26.431 --> 02:38:31.553]  He says that he has information from John Ashcroft that there's a reason
[02:38:32.679 --> 02:38:35.701]  That there's a secure enough of a security threat that this is necessary?
[02:38:35.721 --> 02:38:40.384]  The same government that's been caught lying, what, about a hundred times about weapons of mass destruction and terror threats?
[02:38:40.404 --> 02:38:40.584]  Right.
[02:38:40.864 --> 02:38:44.327]  Well, and they're telling us there's definitely going to be a terrorist attack here in Boston.
[02:38:44.707 --> 02:38:46.808]  Well, you know, again, it was the same thing.
[02:38:46.828 --> 02:38:49.610]  They said there was going to be a terrorist attack in Brunswick.
[02:38:50.111 --> 02:38:54.113]  If I was a terrorist, why would I attack people who were fighting for me?
[02:38:54.814 --> 02:38:55.654]  For freedom?
[02:38:56.135 --> 02:38:58.156]  I mean, come on!
[02:39:02.216 --> 02:39:02.716]  But it works.
[02:39:02.836 --> 02:39:03.997]  It keeps people away.
[02:39:04.457 --> 02:39:08.838]  Well, look, I'm going to have to be honest with you, Jeannie.
[02:39:10.219 --> 02:39:12.279]  Are you familiar with the Northwoods document?
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:13.160]  No, I'm not.
[02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:18.321]  Well, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:39:18.341 --> 02:39:20.362]  Go to the 9-11 prior knowledge section.
[02:39:20.402 --> 02:39:21.162]  This is 9-11.
[02:39:21.903 --> 02:39:23.163]  We have an official U.S.
[02:39:23.203 --> 02:39:29.105]  government plan to carry out terror attacks and blame it on foreign enemies as an excuse
[02:39:30.807 --> 02:39:32.628]  As a pretext to invade foreign countries.
[02:39:32.688 --> 02:39:33.868]  I'm sure you've heard of PNAC?
[02:39:34.208 --> 02:39:34.388]  Yes.
[02:39:34.909 --> 02:39:40.090]  Project for a New American Century said, we need helpful terror attacks on the order of Pearl Harbor.
[02:39:40.971 --> 02:39:43.811]  And so, they're doing nothing to stop terror attacks.
[02:39:43.851 --> 02:39:45.672]  Bin Laden's their little CIA boy.
[02:39:46.092 --> 02:39:47.413]  This whole thing is staged.
[02:39:47.813 --> 02:39:50.353]  And I hope the protesters will start talking about stuff like that.
[02:39:50.854 --> 02:39:53.214]  Because nothing's being done to protect us from terrorists.
[02:39:53.815 --> 02:39:56.475]  And this is all to train us how to live in a police state.
[02:39:56.755 --> 02:39:58.316]  We're already living in a police state.
[02:39:59.251 --> 02:40:05.053]  As I walked back from that cage, I was, I felt, and I wrote this in my article, I felt heartbroken.
[02:40:05.453 --> 02:40:16.317]  But I walked past these pubs where they were just, you know, packed with people, people standing in the door watching the TV over the bar where there was a Patriots game.
[02:40:16.337 --> 02:40:18.358]  I mean, not Patriots, Red Sox.
[02:40:18.378 --> 02:40:24.040]  And I just thought to myself, they don't know what's going on.
[02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:27.701]  And when it's all gone, when our democracy is gone,
[02:40:28.672 --> 02:40:29.352]  They won't notice.
[02:40:29.893 --> 02:40:31.994]  They won't even know that it's gone.
[02:40:34.295 --> 02:40:39.998]  That's why we've got to wake them up, and I appreciate you coming on the show, Jeannie.
[02:40:40.318 --> 02:40:41.999]  Can we get you back up again in a few days?
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:43.140]  Yeah.
[02:40:46.182 --> 02:40:47.282]  I have a phone number there.
[02:40:47.302 --> 02:40:49.464]  I'll call back because I had to use a different phone.
[02:40:49.484 --> 02:40:50.884]  My cell phone was dying on me.
[02:40:50.904 --> 02:40:55.127]  Well, that's fine, but I'd like to get you on when you're out there during the demonstrations.
[02:40:55.647 --> 02:40:56.547]  Be safe and take care.
[02:40:58.015 --> 02:40:58.676]  I appreciate it.
[02:40:58.816 --> 02:41:03.802]  And, you know, again, folks, these have all been kind of Democrat, fringe groups, democracy this, democracy that.
[02:41:03.882 --> 02:41:07.006]  But the point is, they've got a right to say and do whatever they want.
[02:41:07.447 --> 02:41:08.328]  They're not a threat.
[02:41:08.348 --> 02:41:09.950]  The globalists are behind the terror.
[02:41:10.831 --> 02:41:15.276]  And you heard the head of the ACLU on admitting that, oh yeah, they talk about martial law under red alert.
[02:41:15.677 --> 02:41:17.419]  This is all about destroying our freedoms.
[02:41:18.383 --> 02:41:22.564]  And they're going to wall off the cities, have toll roads where they search your cars.
[02:41:23.005 --> 02:41:24.785]  They're going to force vaccines on you.
[02:41:25.485 --> 02:41:27.586]  They're going to build more and more prisons.
[02:41:28.026 --> 02:41:29.047]  This is the new America.
[02:41:29.067 --> 02:41:31.627]  In fact, I'm going to cover some of those articles here in a second.
[02:41:32.208 --> 02:41:33.468]  But let's take a few calls now.
[02:41:33.568 --> 02:41:35.209]  Dan in New Hampshire, thanks for holding.
[02:41:35.449 --> 02:41:36.409]  You're on the air, Dan.
[02:41:36.989 --> 02:41:37.849]  Yes, hello Alex.
[02:41:37.909 --> 02:41:41.131]  I'm glad Jeannie spoke about the baseball game.
[02:41:41.591 --> 02:41:43.711]  Interesting thing happened there.
[02:41:43.811 --> 02:41:45.332]  Kerry made the opening pitch.
[02:41:46.195 --> 02:41:52.937]  And then there was a military soldier full of fatigue, and it looked like he purposely missed it or something.
[02:41:53.037 --> 02:41:57.359]  I don't know, it was just like, yeah, it was like, we're not accepting you.
[02:41:57.599 --> 02:41:59.020]  It looked like a big stumble.
[02:41:59.060 --> 02:42:09.143]  Well, I mean, whether it's the Super Bowl or the NBA Championships or the Kentucky Derby, they have black helicopters, troops, machine guns.
[02:42:09.663 --> 02:42:10.364]  They're training you.
[02:42:10.464 --> 02:42:11.184]  This is normal.
[02:42:11.544 --> 02:42:12.484]  This keeps you safe.
[02:42:12.524 --> 02:42:13.985]  We're getting rid of Poseidon's.
[02:42:15.009 --> 02:42:19.813]  What she said about it being right in front of them, they won't even realize, I mean, there it was, right there.
[02:42:19.833 --> 02:42:28.080]  You know, Kerry throwing a softball to a soldier, and you know, he's not catching it, he's not accepting Kerry, and the police stayed at the pond.
[02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:30.161]  I mean, I just saw so much symbolism.
[02:42:30.482 --> 02:42:31.803]  I was freaking out by it.
[02:42:31.923 --> 02:42:34.785]  But then Kerry is going to do the exact same thing as Bush.
[02:42:35.365 --> 02:42:41.731]  And then there was like a standoff between them, and then finally they shook their hands and walked away, but it's just odd.
[02:42:41.751 --> 02:42:44.713]  I don't know, I saw it, and I just
[02:42:45.765 --> 02:42:48.566]  And another thing, I'm a natural kind of person here.
[02:42:49.226 --> 02:42:53.007]  I really don't like them telling me what herbs I can or can't have.
[02:42:53.427 --> 02:42:56.008]  They're moving to control and ban a lot of that.
[02:42:56.108 --> 02:42:56.948]  It's across the board.
[02:42:57.328 --> 02:43:07.771]  I don't think the listeners get the magnitude of the fact they're going to force our children and adults to take vaccines that change the brain chemistry so, quote, we can't get addicted to drugs.
[02:43:08.211 --> 02:43:10.271]  Yeah, I go out there, I pick St.
[02:43:10.311 --> 02:43:13.612]  John's Wort and Comfrey and a variety of
[02:43:14.161 --> 02:43:15.782]  I hear you, I appreciate the call.
[02:43:15.802 --> 02:43:16.822]  Joshua in South Carolina, go ahead.
[02:43:16.862 --> 02:43:16.942]  Yes.
[02:43:16.962 --> 02:43:18.203]  Hey, am I making it?
[02:43:18.263 --> 02:43:19.183]  Yes, you are.
[02:43:19.943 --> 02:43:20.544]  Hey, what's going on?
[02:43:38.562 --> 02:43:42.284]  I was just going to say that, uh, them pills, they are bad.
[02:43:42.484 --> 02:43:44.225]  Everything's bad, nearly.
[02:43:44.746 --> 02:43:51.389]  You know, how everything's going, but I was just going to say that, uh, you know, you probably don't listen to a lot of music.
[02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:57.073]  I don't know if you do, but there's like a little band called Incubus, and they do a lot of stuff about, like, 1984.
[02:43:57.413 --> 02:44:01.035]  They talk about how the, how the bleed stayed.
[02:44:01.055 --> 02:44:05.978]  It's not the 70s music, except it's a lot more, and people are more woken up to it than
[02:44:06.539 --> 02:44:07.780]  And you know, J.D.
[02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:17.366]  Kiss had one on your show Friday night, you had, if I was right, you had one about why did the terrorists hit, why did they hide behind the cowards and everything.
[02:44:17.726 --> 02:44:19.747]  I mean, people are getting woken up by all this.
[02:44:20.008 --> 02:44:23.070]  Yeah, the number one song in the country says the government carried out 9-11.
[02:44:23.450 --> 02:44:24.110]  Oh yes, sir!
[02:44:24.651 --> 02:44:29.233]  And when the popular culture starts doing that, the globalists are in a lot of trouble.
[02:44:29.273 --> 02:44:29.914]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:31.050 --> 02:44:41.853]  I'll try to get to some more calls if I have time, but I'm just looking at massive stacks here of news that I want to cover that are all of the greatest importance.
[02:44:42.513 --> 02:44:43.754]  Here's the New York Times.
[02:44:43.814 --> 02:44:50.716]  Now again, a year ago, I saw numbers that 7 million people were in the prison system.
[02:44:50.916 --> 02:44:51.896]  People couldn't believe that.
[02:44:51.956 --> 02:44:56.418]  They got four-year-old Justice Department numbers and said, Alex, it says 4 million.
[02:44:57.058 --> 02:44:58.238]  Oh, Alex, it says 2 million.
[02:44:58.298 --> 02:44:58.558]  No, no.
[02:44:58.618 --> 02:45:00.459]  It was 7 million years ago.
[02:45:01.779 --> 02:45:04.600]  Upwards of 5 behind bars.
[02:45:05.241 --> 02:45:07.082]  The numbers are always a few years old.
[02:45:08.062 --> 02:45:11.464]  But you can always get the real numbers, projected numbers.
[02:45:12.324 --> 02:45:14.205]  Right now it's more like 8.5 million.
[02:45:14.685 --> 02:45:17.687]  Again, that's current numbers, but now they're emitting 7 million, or 6.9.
[02:45:18.860 --> 02:45:19.120]  U.S.
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:20.942]  correctional population hits new high.
[02:45:21.343 --> 02:45:31.693]  The number of Americans under the control of criminal justice system grew by 130,700 last year to reach a new high of nearly 6.9 million according to the Justice Department's report released today.
[02:45:32.954 --> 02:45:37.098]  So again, and that's a 3.2% increase in 2003.
[02:45:37.579 --> 02:45:39.481]  But again, those aren't even the real numbers, folks.
[02:45:39.521 --> 02:45:40.622]  It's well over 8 million.
[02:45:41.420 --> 02:45:49.143]  The growth is what the report termed the correctional population comes at a time when the crime rate nationwide has been relatively stable for several years.
[02:45:50.663 --> 02:45:52.824]  And it's now the biggest part of the economy.
[02:45:53.924 --> 02:45:57.426]  And they say it's going to be 30 million by the end of this decade.
[02:45:57.446 --> 02:45:58.646]  Excuse me, 33 million.
[02:45:59.967 --> 02:46:01.987]  So, very, very serious.
[02:46:02.427 --> 02:46:03.048]  Here's an article.
[02:46:03.088 --> 02:46:05.248]  Confusion reigns as security rules.
[02:46:05.368 --> 02:46:06.029]  Oh, security.
[02:46:06.809 --> 02:46:08.370]  This is the Boston Globe.
[02:46:08.670 --> 02:46:09.490]  No, Boston Herald.
[02:46:12.279 --> 02:46:36.187]  Uh, and it says, uh, with a 15-foot fence, and it's more like 30, and black netting, an area around the Fleet Center was transformed into the so-called Hard Zone, where uniformed soldiers, soldiers and police officers in bright orange raincoats, patrolled outside with the Secret Service, uh, completing its suite of the facility and security, uh, uh, threats in preparation of the start of the Democratic National Committee.
[02:46:37.448 --> 02:46:38.628]  And, uh, it goes on and on.
[02:46:38.908 --> 02:46:40.769]  Now, I've got articles here
[02:46:44.068 --> 02:46:44.789]  Oh, there's so many.
[02:46:44.869 --> 02:46:46.630]  Gosh, I should have covered this earlier.
[02:46:46.650 --> 02:46:48.251]  Oh, listen to this.
[02:46:48.931 --> 02:46:50.893]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[02:46:51.633 --> 02:46:53.755]  Japanese Council approves human cloning.
[02:46:54.595 --> 02:46:56.957]  New Jersey approved human cloning on last year, folks.
[02:46:58.098 --> 02:47:01.280]  And that's keeping fetuses alive till birth and using them after birth.
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:01.860]  Oh, yes.
[02:47:02.341 --> 02:47:08.625]  Japan's top science council voted Friday to adopt policy recommendations that would permit the limited cloning of human embryos for scientific research.
[02:47:08.705 --> 02:47:09.886]  Okay, thought you'd want to know about that.
[02:47:11.997 --> 02:47:22.133]  Another article here out of Canada where it says they're going to have RFID chips in the passports and license and it's going to scan everybody and just unspeakable.
[02:47:23.455 --> 02:47:24.377]  Unspeakable.
[02:47:27.495 --> 02:47:30.357]  And then, folks, I could spend the whole show on this.
[02:47:30.457 --> 02:47:32.599]  Children to get jabs against drug addiction.
[02:47:32.979 --> 02:47:38.183]  Ministers consider vaccination scheme, heroin, cocaine, and nicotine targeted.
[02:47:38.203 --> 02:47:46.429]  And it says it changes the chemical protein makeup of the neuroreceptors in your brain and cuts off many forms of endorphins.
[02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:49.672]  That's what narcotics mimic is endorphins.
[02:47:50.893 --> 02:47:51.193]  And so,
[02:47:54.028 --> 02:47:55.729]  And of course the government's approving all these.
[02:47:55.789 --> 02:48:03.255]  In Britain it says the government panel is about to pass a law banking people take this.
[02:48:05.417 --> 02:48:08.339]  And they say, you could say cocaine is more dangerous than measles, for example.
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:18.047]  And it says that the National Anti-Drug Immunization Scheme is one of the proposals being put forward by Brain Science Addiction and Drug Project.
[02:48:19.328 --> 02:48:20.369]  And then down here it says
[02:48:21.804 --> 02:48:30.970]  It says, uh, Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, California has developed a super virus, harmless to humans, which produces proteins that can block or reduce the effects of cocaine.
[02:48:31.671 --> 02:48:34.072]  They're gonna permanently block up your neuroreceptors.
[02:48:34.753 --> 02:48:42.258]  Folks, I don't have words to say how horrible this is, and they're gonna make you take it with men in black ski masks unless you say no!
[02:48:42.278 --> 02:48:43.739]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:48:45.023 --> 02:48:49.350]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:49.531 --> 02:48:53.898]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:56.698 --> 02:48:58.179]  You will lose your liberty.

[02:49:57.453 --> 02:50:01.975]  The Murky's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the black murky purification element.

[02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:20.825]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[02:51:49.224 --> 02:52:01.828]  Folks, I cannot, again, stress that they've already been adding chemicals, hormones, to vaccines to brain damage the entire population that takes them, by design, to sterilize women.
[02:52:01.868 --> 02:52:02.908]  They've been caught doing it.
[02:52:03.628 --> 02:52:11.090]  But now they're overtly saying, oh, we're going to give you a drug that doesn't let you have these certain type of endorphins, that way you won't get addicted to drugs.
[02:52:12.911 --> 02:52:15.491]  And we're going to make you take it because the cost is so great at treating drugs.
[02:52:15.791 --> 02:52:17.852]  And then it changes your brain chemistry with a, quote,
[02:52:19.847 --> 02:52:20.847]  Deadly virus!
[02:52:22.428 --> 02:52:25.469]  Oh, it's deadly in other mammals, but not in you, and it just changes your brain.
[02:52:25.529 --> 02:52:27.730]  Goes in and clogs the recept- Folks!
[02:52:28.610 --> 02:52:29.951]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do!
[02:52:30.011 --> 02:52:43.856]  We're gonna inject you and change your brain, and everything will be fine after we've done- I mean, I've got this stack of news I want to get to, but I just- Do you understand that once they got the electronic voting machines in, they'll say, oh, you all voted for this, shut up, it's a democracy.
[02:52:44.297 --> 02:52:45.817]  Whatever the people want, they get.
[02:52:45.937 --> 02:52:47.718]  Oh, we're gonna arrest those and make you take them.
[02:52:49.421 --> 02:52:54.504]  We got a socialist government now, and we have to pay for the drug addicts, so we'll just give you vaccines where you won't want the drugs anymore.
[02:52:54.804 --> 02:52:56.184]  We're gonna make all your children take it.
[02:52:56.545 --> 02:52:58.125]  This is the new world, people!
[02:52:58.185 --> 02:52:59.306]  We gotta say no!
[02:52:59.326 --> 02:53:01.427]  A republic guards against that!
[02:53:04.142 --> 02:53:05.203]  And then I got this, U.S.
[02:53:05.243 --> 02:53:09.605]  report on prison abuse, a whitewash, ABC News, Australia, U.S.
[02:53:09.645 --> 02:53:15.988]  newspapers, New York Times, Washington Post have opened fire, that's whitewashes, on the conclusions of a report by U.S.
[02:53:16.108 --> 02:53:23.813]  Army on abuses in prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the Times calling it a whitewash to extradite the high command.
[02:53:23.953 --> 02:53:26.214]  Of course they were ordered to do it, but that's another whitewash.
[02:53:27.137 --> 02:53:28.378]  And here's another one.
[02:53:28.458 --> 02:53:28.819]  Poll.
[02:53:28.899 --> 02:53:30.500]  Americans against using torture.
[02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:34.543]  Two-thirds of Americans believe the United States should never use physical torture on people.
[02:53:34.783 --> 02:53:36.565]  We got a third of the people that are that sick.
[02:53:37.045 --> 02:53:38.767]  It detains according to a poll.
[02:53:38.787 --> 02:53:48.374]  A majority, 55% in this country, should never use mental torture such as making someone think that they or their family will be killed.
[02:53:48.755 --> 02:53:50.916]  45% say you can threaten to kill somebody's children.
[02:53:51.057 --> 02:53:52.798]  I mean, what happened to you people?
[02:53:53.305 --> 02:53:57.968]  According to a poll by the Program on International Policy Attitudes by the University of Maryland.
[02:53:59.509 --> 02:54:00.450]  Out of time on that.
[02:54:01.230 --> 02:54:02.971]  Iraq wants Russian peacekeepers.
[02:54:03.031 --> 02:54:05.233]  And that means our government wants Russian peacekeepers.
[02:54:05.493 --> 02:54:07.754]  And that's why Putin says he loves Bush and loves the war.
[02:54:08.215 --> 02:54:10.976]  And Bush's daughters say they just admire Vladimir Putin.
[02:54:11.016 --> 02:54:11.977]  He's such a good man.
[02:54:12.818 --> 02:54:14.278]  And then, oh my goodness.
[02:54:14.919 --> 02:54:17.060]  Again, Putin and Blair are amazing leaders.
[02:54:17.501 --> 02:54:18.621]  Yeah, amazingly evil.
[02:54:18.701 --> 02:54:19.702]  Bush twins, Reuters.
[02:54:20.542 --> 02:54:21.183]  No end to it.
[02:54:22.797 --> 02:54:23.618]  Oh my goodness.
[02:54:24.198 --> 02:54:29.902]  Oh, Bali bombers may be freed, not because there's not enough court evidence, but because they're CIA folks.
[02:54:30.542 --> 02:54:31.503]  That's London Independent.
[02:54:32.683 --> 02:54:38.567]  And, uh, we got articles here about Israeli assassin squads here in the U.S.
[02:54:39.408 --> 02:54:40.828]  It's just out of control.
[02:54:41.969 --> 02:54:45.411]  Another New York Times article about the Bilderberg Group running the planet.
[02:54:45.511 --> 02:54:47.973]  A secret conference thought to rule the world is the headline.
[02:54:48.533 --> 02:54:50.314]  FBI spy planes patrol the U.S.
[02:54:50.334 --> 02:54:50.935]  More on that
[02:54:52.771 --> 02:54:54.971]  We're out of time for this broadcast, folks.

[02:55:51.289 --> 02:55:54.091]  So that means we're basically about to be out of here.
[02:55:54.111 --> 02:55:57.313]  But get my videos, make copies, get them out to people.
[02:55:57.373 --> 02:55:57.894]  Expose this!
[02:56:16.468 --> 02:56:20.474]  Well, they're going to forcibly inject you with vaccines openly that brain damage you.
[02:56:20.754 --> 02:56:22.137]  That change your brain chemistry.
[02:56:22.818 --> 02:56:26.002]  They got vaccines, quote, your genetics show you're aggressive.
[02:56:26.022 --> 02:56:28.406]  We're going to make your child take stuff that makes them docile.
[02:56:28.806 --> 02:56:29.788]  I mean, come on, folks.
[02:56:29.828 --> 02:56:30.809]  That's Brave New World.
